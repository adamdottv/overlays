00:11:43
<transcript>: so

00:11:48
daryn_dev: :O

00:11:48

<transcript>: who's my favorite

00:11:55
<transcript>: Who's my favorite rapper? Steven.

00:11:59
daryn_dev: He chose us guys!

00:12:03
<transcript>: Don't really listen to rappers, so I would say none. None of them good morning, Daniel.

00:12:04
daryn_dev: He chose us over nothing! <3

00:12:07
<transcript>: I chose you all over.

00:12:11
<transcript>: It's funny.

00:12:15
<transcript>: I think my.

00:12:15
<transcript>: we're gonna

00:12:17
<transcript>: on aw

00:12:17
<transcript>: We're gonna actually make some progress.

00:12:18
danielgerep: Good thing you don't have music in the background :)

00:12:23
<transcript>: On AW, guess in an hour. Let's see what we can get done in an hour. I'm gonna cut the chitchat, you know.

00:12:26
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:12:26
<transcript>: i really

00:12:34
<transcript>: I really want to get eight of you guess out there. I think the AWS community will actually enjoy it. I think there's some folks who follow me on Twitter.

00:12:34
<transcript>: that would enjoy

00:12:36
<transcript>: That would enjoy playing with it.

00:12:40
<transcript>: Creaking. Thanks for the follow. Thank you so much.

00:12:45
<transcript>: Let's see normally I stream for like 4 hours.

00:12:45
<transcript>: and much

00:12:48
<transcript>: And much earlier than this. But today.

00:12:53
<transcript>: I chose this. I chose to stream for now I'm gonna stream tomorrow instead of today.

00:12:53
<transcript>: like

00:13:00
<transcript>: Like I was just gonna not do today at all. Tomorrow, I'm gonna do a full stream. So tomorrow morning, my schedule is probably wrong.

00:13:00
<transcript>: just

00:13:01
<transcript>: on tomorrow

00:13:01
<transcript>: Just.

00:13:03
<transcript>: On tomorrow morning.

00:13:08
<transcript>: Let's see we're did we leave on so new game.

00:13:12
<transcript>: This is everything turned on? I don't know. We're about to find out.

00:13:12
<transcript>: oof

00:13:14
<transcript>: it is not turned

00:13:14
<transcript>: Oof no.

00:13:15
<transcript>: It is not turned on.

00:13:15
<transcript>: let's see

00:13:17
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:13:21
<transcript>: That is probably the problem.

00:13:26
<transcript>: Let's reproxy.

00:13:28
<transcript>: Access token.

00:13:31
<transcript>: Peacecale off login.

00:13:33
<transcript>: That's new Oh.

00:13:40
daryn_dev: This needs fixing xD

00:13:41
<transcript>: I don't know. I just leak something. Is that bad? Well.

00:13:41
<transcript>: guess

00:13:43
<transcript>: Guess we'll find out.

00:13:51
<transcript>: I don't have Daniel. I don't have music in the background. Do you want music.

00:13:51
<transcript>: i

00:13:54
<transcript>: I would like to play music actually.

00:13:56
<transcript>: That's not what I want to do.

00:14:00
<transcript>: The P Scale Piece scale.

00:14:05
<transcript>: What is it, proxy? What is the key scale command.

00:14:08
<transcript>: Connect.

00:14:11
<transcript>: Scale connect.

00:14:15
<transcript>: Like that.

00:14:23
<transcript>: Was one way to do it.

00:14:23
<transcript>: let's see

00:14:25
<transcript>: Let's see if.

00:14:25
<transcript>: it's not there

00:14:27
<transcript>: It's not there. Okay.

00:14:31
<transcript>: now that's

00:14:31
<transcript>: Figure that out, okay.

00:14:32
<transcript>: Now that's running.

00:14:32
<transcript>: the

00:14:36
<transcript>: The next JS app is running.

00:14:46
<transcript>: Let's try it again. I'm gonna play music, Daniel. I hope that doesn't bother you too much.

00:14:50
<transcript>: I do like to play music? Ah, I gotta be fast, though.

00:14:52
<transcript>: Think box, rest.

00:14:56
<transcript>: Okay, we got to stop the timer. That's one thing we got to do.

00:15:01
<transcript>: It is professional services. Yeah. Stop the timer.

00:15:04
<transcript>: We've got the score going on up here now.

00:15:07
<transcript>: What is this? Sns.

00:15:11
<transcript>: So you're getting one point for every correct answer.

00:15:19
<transcript>: We're gonna do streaks. What can we get done today? That's Xmesh, right? Yeah.

00:15:25
<transcript>: Okay, let's play music.

00:15:28
<transcript>: Let's play music.

00:15:40
<transcript>: Oh, somebody put the cowboy hat on me. Darren, I gotta make that thing more expensive.

00:15:45
<transcript>: It just. It doesn't work on this view. I don't know why the Chroma key is so weird.

00:15:50
daryn_dev: Hahahah

00:15:51
<transcript>: It just just doesn't work. Oh, that's what you meant by this needs fix. And probably.

00:15:56
<transcript>: A hat. Need some fixing? Okay. How's we want to stop the timer.

00:15:56
<transcript>: how do we

00:15:58
<transcript>: How do we want to stop it.

00:16:01
<transcript>: So when you let's see.

00:16:05
<transcript>: Once you've answered, we want to freeze the timer.

00:16:05
<transcript>: this is our

00:16:06
<transcript>: This is our interval.

00:16:16
<transcript>: So well let's see when you answer we're gonna set something.

00:16:23
<transcript>: Handle answer. Yeah. So here we set result.

00:16:26
<transcript>: Do we send anything right off the bat? No.

00:16:29
<transcript>: when

00:16:29
<transcript>: Need something.

00:16:33
<transcript>: When you immediately like immediately when you answer, we need some state.

00:16:39
<transcript>: It's a time to use dust stand there's a time to do this.

00:16:56
<transcript>: Thanks for the followup camel. I appreciate that.

00:17:02
kamelpaj: heyo yeyo

00:17:05
<transcript>: Okay. So this is what we started to do with zestanned.

00:17:07
<transcript>: We're gonna We're gonna maybe do it again.

00:17:12
<transcript>: Use Game store create game state.

00:17:17
<transcript>: So there's a current round.

00:17:17
<transcript>: there's a

00:17:19
beckinhotv: why is everyone on twitch migrating to vim ?

00:17:19
<transcript>: There's a result.

00:17:19
<transcript>: and a choice

00:17:20
<transcript>: And a choice.

00:17:25
<transcript>: There's a function called Answer where you pass a choice.

00:17:27
<transcript>: It sets the choice.

00:17:31
owencodes: HeyGuys

00:17:34
<transcript>: I guess we need to do something like this, though.

00:17:39
<transcript>: Okay.

00:17:45
<transcript>: If idle. Active. Correct. Incorrect. Expired.

00:17:51
<transcript>: So aside from active, there's also a.

00:17:51
<transcript>: like

00:17:56
<transcript>: Like waiting. It's like you've answered, but we don't know yet.

00:18:01
<transcript>: Pending I don't know.

00:18:04
<transcript>: Okay.

00:18:04
<transcript>: so

00:18:07
<transcript>: So when you answer, we also set the.

00:18:09
<transcript>: Eight.

00:18:11
<transcript>: To.

00:18:15
<transcript>: Eight. Sorry. Pending.

00:18:17
<transcript>: Okay.

00:18:17
<transcript>: so that's

00:18:20
<transcript>: So that's from state idle.

00:18:23
<transcript>: Answer.

00:18:30
<transcript>: I've never used us in before, so I'm pretending like I know what I'm doing. We'll see if I know how to pull this off.

00:18:30
<transcript>: let's see

00:18:34
<transcript>: Let's see, why is everyone on Twitch migraine to Vim beckon.

00:18:40
<transcript>: Because it's the best. No, no. I I've talked about this quite a bit.

00:19:00
<transcript>: I definitely was influenced by Twitch streamers using neovim I had for like five years. I've wanted to invest in them. I just know I move my hand too much. I use my mouth too much. And like, just for posture. Ergonomics all that. I knew I needed to really invest in it and start using less, less navigation with.

00:19:00
<transcript>: my mouth

00:19:02
<transcript>: My mouth.

00:19:02
<transcript>: so that's something

00:19:13
<transcript>: So that's something I've wanted to do for a lot time. I probably could have and should have just done the vim bindings in vs. Code thing that would have saved me a ton of time, but the new thin thing is the Fun house.

00:19:18
<transcript>: It's just been a ton of fun to configure. I have more control over your environment. I think.

00:19:18
<transcript>: teach

00:19:19
<transcript>: Teach.

00:19:19
<transcript>: coined

00:19:26
<transcript>: Coined the Pde personal development environment. It's kind of fun having sort of lots of control.

00:19:26
<transcript>: over

00:19:28
<transcript>: Over.

00:19:28
<transcript>: your

00:19:39
<transcript>: Your IDE. So that's that's kind of why the neovem thing, but definitely influence by all the fantastic streamers on Twitch. I'm gonna move my mic. It's gonna sound awful. Hang on.

00:19:52
daryn_dev: OH! MY EARS!!! OH MYYYY

00:19:52
<transcript>: How's that still out of you. Yeah.

00:19:52
<transcript>: a little closer

00:19:54
<transcript>: A little closer to my face.

00:19:57
<transcript>: Okay. Feels good.

00:20:04
<transcript>: Okay. So we've answer that sets a pending state, and it sets the choice.

00:20:04
<transcript>: that's what you chose

00:20:06
<transcript>: like

00:20:06
<transcript>: That's what you chose.

00:20:08
<transcript>: or for your

00:20:08
<transcript>: Like the thing that you chose to answer.

00:20:11
<transcript>: Or for your answer.

00:20:11
<transcript>: we also need to have

00:20:13
<transcript>: We also need to have let's see.

00:20:16
<transcript>: Is that the only function.

00:20:21
<transcript>: No, that's not the only one thing for the follow I man yon.

00:20:21
<transcript>: i min

00:20:25
<transcript>: I mini. Won I'm anyone? Probably. That. Yeah.

00:20:31
<transcript>: Oh, your ears. What's wrong? Oh, this is Mike.

00:20:32
daryn_dev: @beckinhotv I wish to know as well

00:20:35
<transcript>: Yeah, I did. I moved it.

00:20:45
<transcript>: Okay. So other functions that would update the state.

00:20:49
<transcript>: like

00:20:49
<transcript>: Like when the answer comes back.

00:20:51
<transcript>: Like when the correct answer.

00:20:53
<transcript>: For the wrong answer.

00:21:01
<transcript>: What would we call that function? Because I'm gonna need a way to update the state to set it to.

00:21:04
<transcript>: Correct or Incorrect or expired.

00:21:08
<transcript>: So we'll just call it result.

00:21:18
<transcript>: I'm.

00:21:20
<transcript>: result

00:21:20
<transcript>: Now.

00:21:21
<transcript>: Result.

00:21:21
<transcript>: is a

00:21:23
<transcript>: Is a.

00:21:23
<transcript>: result

00:21:24
<transcript>: Result.

00:21:27
<transcript>: And then.

00:21:30
<transcript>: I guess there's a new round as well.

00:21:39
<transcript>: No, I this result have round on it yeah yeah it's the answer yeah so handle, handle.

00:21:43
<transcript>: Response. Maybe it's better than result. I don't know.

00:21:43
<transcript>: hand result

00:21:45
<transcript>: Hand result.

00:21:47
<transcript>: Void.

00:21:50
<transcript>: Handle result.

00:21:53
<transcript>: Async.

00:21:58
<transcript>: What is it? Results. Result.

00:22:01
<transcript>: so we're gonna

00:22:01
<transcript>: Yeah like that.

00:22:03
<transcript>: So we're gonna have set.

00:22:14
<transcript>: The state is going to be it's going to depend on the result. Right. So state is going to be.

00:22:17
<transcript>: Result dot.

00:22:17
<transcript>: correct

00:22:18
<transcript>: Correct.

00:22:22
<transcript>: But first, let's do if it's expired.

00:22:25
<transcript>: Then expires.

00:22:29
<transcript>: That correct.

00:22:34
<transcript>: Else.

00:22:34
<transcript>: incorrect

00:22:36
<transcript>: Incorrect. Okay.

00:22:42
<transcript>: Kind of a mess. But I think that's the idea.

00:22:51
<transcript>: Let's see state result. So what else changes the choice and the we actually have a result. Right.

00:22:54
<transcript>: We can add that to the state.

00:22:54
<transcript>: when you answer

00:22:56
<transcript>: When you answer, we want to set.

00:22:56
<transcript>: result

00:22:58
<transcript>: Result.

00:23:02
<transcript>: Right. We want to set result to undefined.

00:23:06
<transcript>: Okay.

00:23:11
<transcript>: And then round we get a new round on result.

00:23:14
<transcript>: Undefined here as well.

00:23:19
th3_l3m0n: dual ternary, oh no...

00:23:19
<transcript>: I want to do that.

00:23:25
<transcript>: Not sure yet we'll come back to it here. The round is gonna be result.

00:23:27
<transcript>: At.

00:23:30
<transcript>: Oh, is there.

00:23:30
<transcript>: not a new round

00:23:32
<transcript>: Not a new round on this. Maybe there's not actually.

00:23:39
<transcript>: An idle if you answer.

00:23:39
<transcript>: we

00:23:42
<transcript>: We go to pending.

00:23:45
<transcript>: And we set your choice.

00:23:45
<transcript>: we

00:23:48
<transcript>: We handle the result here.

00:23:48
<transcript>: which set

00:23:51
<transcript>: Which sets to either expired, correct or incorrect.

00:23:57
<transcript>: Right.

00:23:57
<transcript>: and then we're gonna

00:24:00
<transcript>: And then we're gonna go back to idle when there's a new round.

00:24:05
<transcript>: Are we doing that right now? New round mutation.

00:24:10
<transcript>: So handle new game. We create a first round right there.

00:24:14
<transcript>: And then New round.

00:24:20
<transcript>: Has a two second delay.

00:24:28
<transcript>: Okay so after answer we just do new round.

00:24:35
<transcript>: It's the only time we call that fungic function. Yeah. Okay. So we need to have.

00:24:37
<transcript>: Similar.

00:24:37
<transcript>: here we

00:24:39
<transcript>: Here. We need to have a new round.

00:24:43
<transcript>: New round.

00:24:47
<transcript>: I don't know. Does it need any.

00:24:50
<transcript>: Rams. I don't guess.

00:24:55
<transcript>: Okay, new round.

00:24:55
<transcript>: async

00:24:57
<transcript>: Async.

00:25:00
<transcript>: And what's it going to do? It's gonna do.

00:25:08
<transcript>: State is.

00:25:08
<transcript>: idle

00:25:09
<transcript>: Idle.

00:25:13
<transcript>: And result.

00:25:13
<transcript>: undefined

00:25:14
<transcript>: Undefined.

00:25:25
<transcript>: What's the other thing we need to do? I guess we pass the round to it, don't we? Yeah.

00:25:38
<transcript>: Okay.

00:25:38
<transcript>: so

00:25:42
<transcript>: So new round needs to set choices as well.

00:25:46
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:25:46
dnbull: KonCha

00:25:54
<transcript>: Is this looking good? I don't know. Is this looking good.

00:26:01
<transcript>: Cool turn area. Oh, no, yeah? Feels bad? Feels bad? Hey, Dan. Bull.

00:26:03
<transcript>: And the lemon.

00:26:11
<transcript>: Let's see, let's shuffle our music.

00:26:26
<transcript>: Otherwise, we're just gonna be alt J in the whole time, which isn't a bad thing. Maybe the best thing, but okay, so if we have new rounds, we pass around. It sets the round. It says choice and result as undefined and goes to the idle state.

00:26:30
<transcript>: Not idle.

00:26:36
<transcript>: The moment we have a new round, we go to active.

00:26:41
<transcript>: I don't like we haven't started the game yet, right.

00:26:46
<transcript>: Believe so we should have new let's see.

00:26:46
grasp5533: when are we getting the adam.tv news

00:26:50
<transcript>: Okay.

00:26:57
<transcript>: Am I storing this state.

00:26:57
<transcript>: on our

00:27:04
<transcript>: On our Zestan thing. The Elapsed stuff. Do I want that? Mmm. I don't know.

00:27:08
<transcript>: But basically we're gonna get rid of all of those.

00:27:19
<transcript>: Yes.

00:27:21
<transcript>: And then.

00:27:21
<transcript>: game

00:27:22
<transcript>: Game.

00:27:25
<transcript>: I want to store the game.

00:27:25
<transcript>: on this

00:27:27
<transcript>: On this. I guess I should.

00:27:30
<transcript>: I guess I should right.

00:27:38
<transcript>: Yeah so new game is going to be let's see.

00:27:39
dyalicode: can u give same description about ur project awguess ?

00:27:40
<transcript>: New game.

00:27:49
daryn_dev: !awguess

00:27:49
fossabot: awguess is a guessing game where you're given an AWS service icon and you have to choose the correct service! https://github.com/adamelmore/awguess

00:27:54
<transcript>: I need to do that.

00:27:59
<transcript>: Okay.

00:28:05
<transcript>: Set state.

00:28:11
<transcript>: And then I guess.

00:28:14
<transcript>: Save is active.

00:28:19
<transcript>: What I do here.

00:28:23
<transcript>: Okay new game.

00:28:23
<transcript>: just goes

00:28:26
<transcript>: Just goes to active. It sets the gang.

00:28:30
<transcript>: I guess it would clear out the round.

00:28:32
dyalicode: @daryn_dev tnx

00:28:33
<transcript>: Right.

00:28:38
<transcript>: Look, it clears out. Everything.

00:28:41
<transcript>: To clear out results.

00:28:43
<transcript>: This feels dirty? Why does this feel dirty.

00:28:48
<transcript>: Result in choice.

00:28:52
<transcript>: Sound resulting choice. Okay.

00:28:56
<transcript>: So really, am I carrying anything over from State? Not really.

00:29:04
<transcript>: so new games

00:29:04
<transcript>: Okay.

00:29:09
<transcript>: So new games. Is that answered? Does this.

00:29:13
<transcript>: What does answer to result.

00:29:16
<transcript>: Is undefined.

00:29:20
<transcript>: Round is unchanged. Game is unchanged.

00:29:25
<transcript>: State goes to pending and choices set okay.

00:29:31
<transcript>: Handle result.

00:29:31
<transcript>: yep

00:29:33
<transcript>: Yep, set state.

00:29:36
<transcript>: Okay.

00:29:39
<transcript>: New round.

00:29:44
<transcript>: Wipe out choice and results. Let's say to active.

00:29:51
<transcript>: Okay. I think this is all pretty good. Pretty good.

00:29:58
<transcript>: Hey, Grasp, when are we getting the Adam TV news.

00:30:01
<transcript>: Hopefully soon.

00:30:10
<transcript>: There have been some wrinkles.

00:30:10
<transcript>: some things

00:30:11
<transcript>: Some things that.

00:30:11
<transcript>: like i

00:30:13
<transcript>: Like I don't control.

00:30:16
<transcript>: or the sale of it

00:30:16
<transcript>: The Adam TV domain.

00:30:17
<transcript>: Or the sale of it.

00:30:21
<transcript>: There's someone else who owns it. So that's a wild card.

00:30:21
<transcript>: that

00:30:23
<transcript>: had originally

00:30:23
<transcript>: That person.

00:30:30
<transcript>: Had originally said something about what they would sell for, and they've since changed their mind. So.

00:30:30
<transcript>: that's been a wrinkle

00:30:32
<transcript>: that we're working through

00:30:32
<transcript>: That's been a wrinkle.

00:30:34
<transcript>: That we're working through? We're working through it.

00:30:39
<transcript>: And that's all I'll say about that.

00:30:42
<transcript>: so here

00:30:42
<transcript>: Okay.

00:30:49
<transcript>: So here's our timer thing. Okay. So I guess I need to use this. I need to use this thing, right.

00:30:49
<transcript>: const

00:30:51
<transcript>: equals

00:30:51
<transcript>: Const. State.

00:30:51
daryn_dev: You should try handle that runtime error ;)

00:30:52
<transcript>: use

00:30:52
<transcript>: Equals.

00:30:55
<transcript>: use game

00:30:55
<transcript>: Use what is it called.

00:30:58
<transcript>: Use Game. What did I call it? Game store.

00:30:58
<transcript>: i pass

00:31:03
<transcript>: I passed nothing to that. So this is my this is my first time using the stand.

00:31:07
<transcript>: I know nothing.

00:31:07
<transcript>: that is a gay

00:31:14
<transcript>: That is a gay state, though. Is it? Is it that simple? And that'll change, as I call those functions, I guess.

00:31:20
<transcript>: Right. So I no longer need game there because it's on the game. State.

00:31:24
<transcript>: So I can do like this right? Gang.

00:31:24
<transcript>: round

00:31:26
<transcript>: Round.

00:31:28
<transcript>: Choice.

00:31:30
<transcript>: Result.

00:31:30
<transcript>: state

00:31:32
<transcript>: State.

00:31:41
<transcript>: New round new game let's do game first new game new round.

00:31:42
<transcript>: Answers.

00:31:44
<transcript>: All of them.

00:31:48
<transcript>: New round is that one.

00:31:57
<transcript>: Is new round colored like that.

00:32:00
<transcript>: Maybe just because everything's broken and it doesn't like it.

00:32:00
<transcript>: we'll get

00:32:02
<transcript>: We'll get there.

00:32:02
<transcript>: new

00:32:04
<transcript>: New round.

00:32:10
<transcript>: Handle result new game. Okay, so I need to handle result.

00:32:15
<transcript>: Handle result.

00:32:20
<transcript>: So there's my state duplicate Identifier. Gotcha.

00:32:23
<transcript>: I already have a new round.

00:32:31
<transcript>: Okay on our timer. Let's see this is going to be round.

00:32:36
<transcript>: Everyone we see current round. We can replace that right.

00:32:39
<transcript>: Like this.

00:32:43
<transcript>: can be just

00:32:43
<transcript>: Current round.

00:32:45
<transcript>: Can be just round.

00:32:53
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:32:53
<transcript>: set

00:33:02
<transcript>: Set current round that's now gonna be so handle new game that's when you click the handle new game button, we go ahead and create a new game and a new round.

00:33:02
<transcript>: we're going

00:33:04
<transcript>: We're going to.

00:33:06
<transcript>: Set.

00:33:11
<transcript>: We're gonna do the new game. We pass the game, right.

00:33:18
<transcript>: We're gonna call new round.

00:33:18
<transcript>: password

00:33:19
<transcript>: Password.

00:33:25
<transcript>: Arguments.

00:33:33
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. Because we still have this new round here.

00:33:36
<transcript>: Okay.

00:33:42
<transcript>: Let's see if not round.

00:33:49
<transcript>: What is this button? This is a function that's called Down Below. Yeah, we'll handle that. Okay.

00:33:58
<transcript>: So handle new Game when you click the button the new Game button. This is what we do. We call New Game mutation. We call New Round mutation.

00:33:58
<transcript>: that new game

00:34:03
<transcript>: That new game. We sitting around that's kind of ugly, but like, it's fine. It works, right.

00:34:09
<transcript>: Okay, and then let's ignore this one for a SEC.

00:34:09
<transcript>: and we'll

00:34:13
<transcript>: you choose

00:34:13
<transcript>: And we'll answer, this is when you when you click a button.

00:34:17
<transcript>: You choose a choice, right? So we say it's not round. Return.

00:34:17
<transcript>: under

00:34:19
<transcript>: Under that.

00:34:23
<transcript>: I don't know why I'm doing that.

00:34:26
<transcript>: Oh, because I need to know that round is not.

00:34:28
<transcript>: Undefined. Okay.

00:34:36
<transcript>: So we call answer mutation, but we also need to appear. We need to say answer.

00:34:44
<transcript>: Choice. Right. That's going to set our state to pending and do all that stuff. That's what we can drive our UI off of. And then here.

00:34:44
<transcript>: we're going to

00:34:47
<transcript>: We're going to handle result.

00:34:50
<transcript>: I.

00:35:07
<transcript>: Expect.

00:35:13
<transcript>: New round expects around.

00:35:21
<transcript>: So I have to actually. Yeah. Up here.

00:35:26
<transcript>: That's actually create a new round. We were doing that here.

00:35:26
<transcript>: after

00:35:29
<transcript>: After a timeout. So we're kind of kind of we're gonna, like, run all this code.

00:35:29
<transcript>: down here

00:35:31
<transcript>: Down here.

00:35:37
<transcript>: Right.

00:35:41
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:35:46
<transcript>: And then we need okay, so.

00:35:49
<transcript>: set result

00:35:49
<transcript>: I'm not handled.

00:35:52
<transcript>: Set results undefined. I don't need to do that anymore.

00:35:56
<transcript>: We just need to call the new round mutation.

00:35:56
<transcript>: and

00:35:58
<transcript>: And then.

00:36:00
<transcript>: New round.

00:36:01
<transcript>: Response.

00:36:04
<transcript>: Okay.

00:36:07
<transcript>: You Following Everybody following.

00:36:15
<transcript>: Let's see. Darren. You should try. Handle that runtime error. What was the runtime error.

00:36:21
<transcript>: So Mr. Runtime error.

00:36:29
<transcript>: It's kind of a weird stream. I'm really like, I'm just doing stuff, not really interacting much. So I'm sorry for that. Everybody.

00:36:34
daryn_dev: :O

00:36:36
<transcript>: Or I'm not. I don't know. I get to deal with it on right now. Deal with it. Snot even interacting. Just doing stuff.

00:36:43
<transcript>: Well, hang out like lots of minutes. I got. I have no agenda here. Just thought I get a little something done.

00:36:49
<transcript>: Did I already fix all the errors? Oh, I'm not using state anywhere. Okay.

00:36:50
daryn_dev: Ok guys, he chose us over nothing, but still doesn't love us PoroSad

00:36:54
<transcript>: It doesn't seem like I should have already fixed all these errors, but.

00:36:56
<transcript>: I'll take it.

00:37:00
niftynate80: Stuff

00:37:06
<transcript>: So that is our timer thing.

00:37:06
<transcript>: and

00:37:13
<transcript>: And it'll answer and then handle result and then new round. Okay. All that looks good. So then down here.

00:37:19
<transcript>: Is this all just right? Game score. Oh, you know what I need to do is up here.

00:37:19
<transcript>: in our zone

00:37:20
<transcript>: In our zone.

00:37:20
<transcript>: thing

00:37:25
<transcript>: Thing when we handle results, we need to set game.

00:37:32
<transcript>: Result back game.

00:37:43
<transcript>: Once we were taking our score from Right, it's kind of weird that we have game. It's technically, it's in two places. It's kind of weird.

00:37:43
<transcript>: okay

00:37:46
<transcript>: Okay. So now.

00:37:48
<transcript>: Down here.

00:37:49
daryn_dev: I know how to get his attention

00:37:52
<transcript>: We can say.

00:38:04
<transcript>: Game. Okay, we show the game. Score it's there's not around. We give you a new game button, right.

00:38:12
<transcript>: Which we should instead of not around. We should say if.

00:38:12
<transcript>: eight

00:38:14
<transcript>: Eight is idle.

00:38:20
<transcript>: Is that right.

00:38:20
<transcript>: let's

00:38:25
<transcript>: Let's get a little more technically correct here. So state is idle. We show that button.

00:38:25
<transcript>: if

00:38:26
<transcript>: If.

00:38:29
<transcript>: Game? What was that? Therein.

00:38:29
<transcript>: goodness

00:38:30
<transcript>: short

00:38:30
<transcript>: Goodness.

00:38:35
<transcript>: Short stream given out gift subs oh, you know how to get my attention.

00:38:37
daryn_dev: GOT IT!

00:38:42
<transcript>: I hate that you spent money to get my attention. I could have given you attention some other way.

00:38:46
<transcript>: He chose us over nothing. But still this.

00:38:47
daryn_dev: Hahahahaha

00:38:57
<transcript>: You did get my attention. Thank you so much, Darren. Thanks so much for the gift substrate. You just showed up recently.

00:38:57
<transcript>: and

00:38:59
<transcript>: And you just started giving out subs.

00:39:14
<transcript>: And the image.

00:39:16
<transcript>: Right.

00:39:18
daryn_dev: People must know to Sub MaxLOL

00:39:20
<transcript>: Class.

00:39:29
<transcript>: Actually push all this stuff up when we're done here, it'd be a great productive hour.

00:39:32
<transcript>: State, what is that? State.

00:39:36
<transcript>: What is that state.

00:39:40
<transcript>: where's

00:39:40
<transcript>: See that.

00:39:42
<transcript>: Where's that.

00:39:47
<transcript>: Hey, oh, here we go.

00:39:50
<transcript>: Success or error.

00:39:50
<transcript>: that's

00:39:53
<transcript>: That's for the button.

00:39:53
<transcript>: like did you

00:39:56
<transcript>: Like, did you get the button right? That's different.

00:40:10
<transcript>: Okay. Well. Oh, yeah. I started to make that a motion that Div cuz. I was gonna do something with framer. What was it gonna do with this.

00:40:13
<transcript>: I don't need to do it anymore.

00:40:18
<transcript>: Right.

00:40:21
<transcript>: Not using framer anymore.

00:40:21
<transcript>: okay but

00:40:23
<transcript>: Okay, but we have a game. State.

00:40:23
<transcript>: and i think

00:40:26
<transcript>: And I think we're handling all that.

00:40:26
<transcript>: correctly

00:40:27
<transcript>: Correctly.

00:40:27
<transcript>: i think

00:40:28
<transcript>: I think.

00:40:32
<transcript>: I think so.

00:40:47
<transcript>: What did I want to do, though? At the beginning? Oh, yeah? I'm gonna say if it's expired so here we go. New game. Is this working? Yeah. If it's expired, we want to stop the timer. Right.

00:40:53
<transcript>: What is this IoT core? I have snowball edge. Of course. Okay, so up here.

00:40:56
<transcript>: We're gonna say right here.

00:40:56
<transcript>: we're gonna say

00:40:58
<transcript>: We're gonna say if.

00:41:06
<transcript>: You just do right here, right.

00:41:09
<transcript>: Say if.

00:41:09
<transcript>: if

00:41:10
<transcript>: If.

00:41:11
schrew: G (late) m adam!

00:41:15
<transcript>: State dot or State does not equal.

00:41:17
<transcript>: Fired.

00:41:25
<transcript>: How about that.

00:41:25
<transcript>: how about that

00:41:27
<transcript>: How about that.

00:41:27
<transcript>: does that work

00:41:28
<transcript>: Does that work.

00:41:30
daryn_dev: If it expires, shouldn't it perhaps highlight the correct answer for the user, and then proceed to the next round?

00:41:30
<transcript>: So Ground station.

00:41:30
<transcript>: it should stop the

00:41:32
<transcript>: It should stop the timer. It did not.

00:41:36
<transcript>: Why did it not.

00:41:36
<transcript>: oh because

00:41:39
<transcript>: if state

00:41:39
<transcript>: Oh, because it yeah, Yeah.

00:41:44
<transcript>: If state doesn't equal expired or pending right, it's actually a State is not equal pending.

00:41:48
<transcript>: it's pinning

00:41:48
<transcript>: Right.

00:42:02
<transcript>: It's pinning. We want to stop the timer. What is this? Something with Sage Maker augmented AI. Oh, okay. So it stopped for a second, and then it went straight to so it would only be a state is active. That's the better way to do this.

00:42:02
<transcript>: if state

00:42:03
<transcript>: is

00:42:03
<transcript>: If state.

00:42:05
<transcript>: Is active.

00:42:14
<transcript>: I'm gonna answer this.

00:42:14
<transcript>: one

00:42:18
<transcript>: One. I don't know. Okay. It's stopped the timer. That's what we were looking for.

00:42:22
<transcript>: Config last interface storage gateway store gateway.

00:42:25
<transcript>: Okay, we got the timer working.

00:42:28
<transcript>: We've got one point.

00:42:28
<transcript>: is that right

00:42:29
<transcript>: Is that right.

00:42:29
<transcript>: what is this

00:42:32
<transcript>: i don't know

00:42:32
<transcript>: What is this? What is this.

00:42:33
<transcript>: I don't know.

00:42:35
<transcript>: Bazillion tub.

00:42:39
<transcript>: I only learned recently that.

00:42:39
<transcript>: resili

00:42:42
<transcript>: Resilience hub is a thing. Is this Proton. What is this.

00:42:45
<transcript>: Mq.

00:42:51
<transcript>: Not a great start to this one. That's something with Kubernetes. Oh, Kafka. Of course.

00:42:56
<transcript>: Okay. So we need to figure out how we want to do the score.

00:42:56
<transcript>: like

00:43:00
<transcript>: Like display the score differently etc. Etc.

00:43:05
<transcript>: So good good late morning? Shrew.

00:43:14
<transcript>: If it expires, shouldn't produce, perhaps highlight the correct answer for the user and then proceed to the next round. Yes, Darren, it should. I don't think we're doing that yet. You're right.

00:43:19
<transcript>: It's should do that.

00:43:27
cowfacedude99: kind o hard to take you seriously with those glasses LUL

00:43:34
<transcript>: How we doing? Has there been doing? I didn't really talk at the beginning. I just kind of, like, jump straight into stuff because we just got an hour. It's a short, stream, cow face. Kind of hard to take you seriously with the glasses behind.

00:43:42
daryn_dev: MaxLOL

00:43:49
<transcript>: Oh, you know what? I never heard Monday. The people.

00:43:49
<transcript>: arrive in i

00:43:51
schrew: slept poorly last night :( not very productive today either :(

00:43:51
<transcript>: Arrive in Iceland.

00:43:54
<transcript>: I have not heard.

00:43:54
<transcript>: i

00:43:56
<transcript>: I haven't heard if it made it.

00:43:59
<transcript>: Need to follow up.

00:43:59
<transcript>: where's my

00:44:02
<transcript>: Where's my DMs? There we go. Whispers.

00:44:05
<transcript>: I don't guess sickmofos around is he.

00:44:12
<transcript>: i slept

00:44:12
<transcript>: Sure you slip. Pour that's like me too. That's why I didn't stream this morning.

00:44:14
<transcript>: I slept bad last night.

00:44:17
<transcript>: I got up at my normal time.

00:44:17
<transcript>: and i

00:44:22
<transcript>: And I put on some clothes. And then I was like, Nope. Right back to bed. Too tired.

00:44:22
<transcript>: so i'll stream

00:44:30
<transcript>: So I'll stream tomorrow my normal time, but yeah, some days just aren't very productive. I'm learning to accept that 15 years into my career.

00:44:33
<transcript>: I'm finally starting to accept there will be days.

00:44:33
<transcript>: that just aren't that

00:44:36
<transcript>: That just aren't that productive. And that's okay.

<transcript>: We need to.

00:44:54
<transcript>: If it expires, move to the next round because I don't think we're doing anything right now. Yeah, yeah, we can see it. It's just sitting here.

00:44:54
<transcript>: when

00:44:57
<transcript>: When you show the correct answer, move to the next round.

<transcript>: Yeah, sorry, county. Maybe the next one. You know what? Oh, that reminds me. I got two sons coming. I'm pumped. Mode is gonna I reached out to mode. They're gonna build they're gonna build one of my Sonets for me. I asked them if they would please.

00:45:32
<transcript>: because

00:45:43
<transcript>: Because they built this 80 and it sounds fantastic and there's just no way I'm gonna do as good a job as the folks. The fine folks at mode.

00:45:43
<transcript>: so

00:45:44
<transcript>: So.

00:45:44
<transcript>: modes building

00:45:50
<transcript>: i don't know

00:45:50
<transcript>: Modes building one of my Faunts. They built it yesterday. Actually, I'm very excited. It's gonna be a different look.

00:45:56
<transcript>: it's what

00:45:56
<transcript>: I don't know if you've seen this on it, if anyone here knows what I'm talking about, but it's a new keyboard that mode is making.

00:46:12
<transcript>: It's. What is that layout? It's not 60. It's like, it's like, shrink down this TKL that I've got, like, shoved the arrow keys into everything and keep a function row, though. I'll pull up a picture. We'll look at a picture. So, Darren, you came here.

00:46:12
<transcript>: from

00:46:13
<transcript>: From.

00:46:25
<transcript>: you can play

00:46:25
<transcript>: A recommended channel on Twitch. That's cool. Jez. Pause. Welcome to Chat. Just tune in. Found you on recommended channels. I guess the algorithm works. Then you're staying. Even signed up for public or Dev. That's awesome.

00:46:28
<transcript>: You can play with it now. Jazz paused.

00:46:28
<transcript>: here's

00:46:28
adamdotdev: !betakey

00:46:29
fossabot: Use beta key `adamisontwitch2` after signing up at public.dev.

00:46:30
<transcript>: Here's the Beta key.

00:46:36
<transcript>: In Fred Kiss. Thanks. My mustache shoots me. I don't know about that.

00:46:36
<transcript>: erin

00:46:40
<transcript>: Erin's. Welcome to Chad, as well. Thanks for for showing up.

00:46:43
<transcript>: Okay.

00:46:43
<transcript>: let's make some changes

00:46:45
<transcript>: Let's make some changes, and I'm gonna pull up the Sonic.

00:46:48
<transcript>: So mode.

00:46:51
<transcript>: Mode designs.

00:46:55
<transcript>: Here's. The sonnet, the shape of the son and everything.

00:47:00
<transcript>: I'm very curious, though some of the in the office.

00:47:05
<transcript>: I'm very curious what the acoustics are like.

00:47:07
<transcript>: Where's a picture of it.

00:47:07
<transcript>: we just do a picture

00:47:11
cowfacedude99: so it's like a 70%

00:47:13
<transcript>: is there a name

00:47:13
<transcript>: We just do a picture of it. There we go. That's the sonnet. So you like Shove? I don't know. What is this layout called.

00:47:16
<transcript>: it's definitely

00:47:16
<transcript>: Is there a name for this layout? It's like a 70%. Yeah.

00:47:20
<transcript>: It's definitely not a 60%. It's got the function row.

00:47:20
<transcript>: but

00:47:20
cowfacedude99: but with fn keys.

00:47:26
<transcript>: But it's kind of like a 60% with a function row. Is how I look at it. Yeah. 70%. Okay.

00:47:33
<transcript>: I don't even remember what colors and everything. I think I'm getting a white one. I don't know why. Black. Maybe.

00:47:33
<transcript>: anyway

00:47:34
<transcript>: Anyway.

00:47:38
<transcript>: There should be later this month, I think. Okay.

00:47:38
<transcript>: let's do

00:47:41
<transcript>: Let's do this. Let's do the expires thing.

00:47:44
<transcript>: Just happened.

00:47:44
<transcript>: okay let's

00:47:47
<transcript>: Okay, let's do when it expires.

00:47:54
<transcript>: Where do we want to listen to that? So let's see. Handle this game. Handle answer. This would be like nothing happened.

00:48:00
<transcript>: You didn't answer. So do we want to separate use effect that's kind of watching.

00:48:06
<transcript>: Oh, maybe we should put it on our store thing. I guess I should put most of my state in here, right.

00:48:08
<transcript>: expired

00:48:08
<transcript>: We should have handled.

00:48:11
<transcript>: Expired handle expired.

00:48:15
<transcript>: Is that a good idea.

00:48:18
<transcript>: Maybe.

00:48:22
<transcript>: the

00:48:22
<transcript>: And that would change.

00:48:23
<transcript>: The.

00:48:29
<transcript>: Way that would change the state.

00:48:34
<transcript>: To expire.

00:48:50
<transcript>: Substance doesn't have any way to do, like timed transitions or anything right where you can, like say then transition to this or run this after. I know, like if I did a full state machine with X state, I could do that kind of thing.

00:48:51
<transcript>: But.

00:48:51
<transcript>: i don't

00:48:54
<transcript>: I don't guess there's a way to do that in zestand.

00:49:01
<transcript>: What do I do? What I do wrong here. Argument type game. State. Boys nonstop.

00:49:11
<transcript>: Can I mess up? Oh, no. I don't understand what I did.

00:49:13
<transcript>: Set.

00:49:18
<transcript>: Something wrong with this? My missing.

00:49:20
<transcript>: No.

00:49:24
<transcript>: Oh, I didn't put prints. Yeah.

00:49:26
<transcript>: What did I just do.

00:49:36
<transcript>: Like that.

00:49:38
<transcript>: Oh.

00:49:46
<transcript>: Sometimes the Vin is not with me. I was the case for the vim.

00:49:50
<transcript>: Soak me for Sook me.

00:49:58
<transcript>: Wrong.

00:50:04
<transcript>: There's too many of those there we go. No. Still wrong.

00:50:07
<transcript>: Here.

00:50:09
<transcript>: Set.

00:50:13
<transcript>: Up. Start over. Undoing.

00:50:15
<transcript>: Let's start over.

00:50:15
<transcript>: set

00:50:17
<transcript>: Set? Here we go.

00:50:20
<transcript>: Everything's good. We're doing a set.

00:50:22
<transcript>: Eight.

00:50:25
<transcript>: And then we're gonna do like this.

00:50:26
<transcript>: Eight.

00:50:33
<transcript>: Valid JavaScript syntax.

00:50:35
<transcript>: Script, whatever.

00:50:35
<transcript>: i really

00:50:42
<transcript>: I really got I really gotta remove the Howdy partner because it freaked me out when I look up and I see this invisible hat on my head.

00:50:45
<transcript>: It's just something about it.

00:50:47
daryn_dev: NOOO

00:50:49
<transcript>: I'll make it a million points. Like the animatom.

00:50:52
daryn_dev: It's funny MaxLOL

00:50:53
tizi_kuro: is the keyboard you were searching before. is it good for games

00:50:55
<transcript>: No, you love the invisible hat on my head. Darren. I'll leave it just for you.

00:51:00
<transcript>: So State is expired.

00:51:03
<transcript>: What else happens when you, when it expires.

00:51:04
daryn_dev: Aww <3

00:51:09
<transcript>: Choice and result.

00:51:09
<transcript>: and round

00:51:09
daryn_dev: Just for that

00:51:13
<transcript>: And round will change, but those will change when we set a new round.

00:51:21
<transcript>: We'll just go to expired state. We're gonna have to listen. Well, here we would know right here. Right it's if expired.

00:51:21
<transcript>: sorry

00:51:24
<transcript>: Sorry it's a lapse is greater than.

00:51:24
<transcript>: darren

00:51:25
<transcript>: Darren.

00:51:25
<transcript>: darren

00:51:27
<transcript>: Darren.

00:51:31
<transcript>: Darren, with the gifts, Hub. Thank you so much, Darren.

00:51:31
<transcript>: you're up to

00:51:38
<transcript>: You're up to a lot now. You've gifted so many guests. Somebody gets subs. You've just been here for like two days. I think you've seen two of my streams.

00:51:48
<transcript>: The keyboard you were searching before. Is it good for games? I have no idea. It's a mechanical keyboard. So.

00:51:48
<transcript>: if you

00:51:51
<transcript>: If you like mechanical keyboards.

00:51:56
daryn_dev: This is the 2nd stream, yes MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL

00:52:01
<transcript>: They just I think I like them because they're attractive. And they're very well made. So they're like all metal. They're just like, heavy. And they're nice. They're really nice. They're really nice.

00:52:04
<transcript>: Second stream. Darren.

00:52:04
<transcript>: just

00:52:06
<transcript>: Just came on strong.

00:52:12
<transcript>: I like having you around. It's funny. The the streaming. Like the evolution.

00:52:20
<transcript>: Of streaming. I got this is my third month of streaming, and I feel like every month, it's like a different crowd. It's like.

00:52:28
<transcript>: There's still people who are here like Frag, has been here since the beginning and Strewp. And there's still people that true. I mean, people that have been around a long time.

00:52:31
<transcript>: What was that.

00:52:35
<transcript>: Something either fell in my office.

00:52:35
<transcript>: hang on

00:52:36
<transcript>: Hang on.

00:52:43
<transcript>: There was a loud noise. I don't know what it was.

00:52:47
<transcript>: Something meant something may have fallen.

00:52:53
<transcript>: Let's see a lap. So we could say if.

00:52:56
delvoid: greenscreen fell over Kappa

00:52:57
<transcript>: Elapse is greater than 100 or equals 100.

00:52:57
<transcript>: that means it

00:52:59
<transcript>: That means it expired. Right.

00:53:07
<transcript>: Could we handle expired in that case.

00:53:09
<transcript>: Maybe.

00:53:11
<transcript>: What do we think.

00:53:11
<transcript>: how do i

00:53:13
<transcript>: How do I want to do this.

00:53:13
<transcript>: because

00:53:17
<transcript>: Because there's some things we have to do in that case.

00:53:26
<transcript>: Let's see, let's just do it. Let's say.

00:53:31
<transcript>: If current is greater than expired.

00:53:47
<transcript>: Then here we're going to say handle expired.

00:53:53
<transcript>: Oh, I got to do it up here.

00:53:56
<transcript>: Handle expired.

00:53:58
<transcript>: Okay.

00:54:04
<transcript>: So we're gonna handle expired in that case. And then should I just have a use effect.

00:54:14
<transcript>: i don't know

00:54:14
<transcript>: So just have a use effect maybe like this.

00:54:22
<transcript>: so

00:54:22
<transcript>: I don't know. This still feels kind of gross. Like, shouldn't I be able to avoid some of this growth stuff with this stand? I could just do this.

00:54:25
daryn_dev: Is it possible to gift more subs than there are available viewers? O_o

00:54:25
<transcript>: So have an effect that reacts to state.

00:54:27
<transcript>: Right.

00:54:32
<transcript>: So if State equals expired.

00:54:37
<transcript>: Like I want to fire off.

00:54:40
<transcript>: Want to fire off like.

00:54:50
<transcript>: The new round here. Right. I want to show the actual result, so I guess handle expired is kind of complicated. We need to.

00:54:50
<transcript>: need actually

00:54:55
<transcript>: Need actually get the answer. So get the correct answer.

00:55:01
<transcript>: We don't want to manipulate the score, though. It's like we need a new we need a new.

00:55:08
<transcript>: Function right here on the back end. So we have answer but we need to know.

00:55:17
<transcript>: We need like a just get the response. I guess we could change the answer.

00:55:17
<transcript>: one

00:55:18
<transcript>: One.

00:55:22
<transcript>: Could change the answer.

00:55:27
<transcript>: To accept. Yeah. So choice could be optional, I guess. Right.

00:55:27
<transcript>: think for the

00:55:30
<transcript>: green screen

00:55:30
<transcript>: Think for the follow. Despose. Just pause.

00:55:33
<transcript>: Green screen fell over. I don't think so.

00:55:41
<transcript>: Is it possible to get more subs than there are available viewers therein? I don't know, but I don't want to answer because I don't want you to do to go gifting a ton of subs.

00:55:48
<transcript>: Don't there's 63 viewers there, and so I don't think you need to gift 63.

00:55:48
<transcript>: subs

00:55:54
<transcript>: Subs. Also a lot of them the people viewing are subbed so they can't receive a gift if they're already Subd. Right.

00:55:56
daryn_dev: xD

00:56:00
rihanshazih: they can ;)

00:56:05
daryn_dev: :O

00:56:06
<transcript>: I don't even know if you know that I donate the proceeds.

00:56:13
<transcript>: I'll pay out on Twitter. I donate to trade war organizations. Mostly they're gonna be organizations to do what.

00:56:13
<transcript>: the diversity

00:56:15
<transcript>: so

00:56:15
<transcript>: The Diversity in tech.

00:56:19
<transcript>: So we've only had one payout. We donated that to girls who code.

00:56:21
cowfacedude99: I think so. they maybe go to the people who have been here before.

00:56:22
<transcript>: Just so you know.

00:56:33
<transcript>: If anyone on the stream didn't know that all these gifts. I appreciate them a whole lot. They go to a good cause. I think so. They maybe go to the people who have been here before. It makes sense.

00:56:35
daryn_dev: Oh, awesome! Even more reason to gift subs <3 <3 <3

00:56:40
<transcript>: you do it like

00:56:40
<transcript>: Then makes sense. Okay. So choice doesn't have a minimum. Is basically what I'm saying now. Right.

00:56:42
<transcript>: You do it like this.

00:56:42
<transcript>: was less than

00:56:44
<transcript>: Was less than no.

00:56:44
<transcript>: the choice could be

00:56:47
<transcript>: The choice could be empty if choices empty.

00:56:51
<transcript>: Let's see, where do we have choice.

00:56:51
<transcript>: round any

00:56:53
<transcript>: Round any answer equals choice, so it would be incredible.

00:56:58
<transcript>: Which is correct. Right? Like that's the correct behavior on the back end.

00:57:03
delvoid: you can do .optional() i think

00:57:04
<transcript>: For the answer like you got it wrong. If you don't pass a choice, then you got it wrong right.

00:57:06
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:57:09
<transcript>: That sounds right.

00:57:09
<transcript>: okay

00:57:09
rihanshazih: "incorrect, which is correct" - adam

00:57:13
<transcript>: Okay, so handle expired needs to do some things.

00:57:19
<transcript>: On expired.

00:57:22
<transcript>: For expiration.

00:57:24
<transcript>: On expiration.

00:57:24
<transcript>: on

00:57:26
<transcript>: On expired I don't know.

00:57:30
cowfacedude99: I have gotten subs like that from other streams two or three times.

00:57:35
<transcript>: We need to do some things. One of those things is handle expired. That updates our state, right.

00:57:42
<transcript>: But one what we also need to do is call andromutation.

00:57:46
<transcript>: Right Const response equals.

00:57:50
<transcript>: Await answers? Mutation.

00:57:54
<transcript>: What are we going to do here.

00:57:56
<transcript>: You take a sink.

00:58:01
<transcript>: And we're gonna pass the round ID.

00:58:08
<transcript>: right

00:58:08
<transcript>: And then choice. We'll just pass. Choice.

00:58:09
<transcript>: Right.

00:58:12
<transcript>: Async.

00:58:15
daryn_dev: Alright, I'm out to grab dinner. Cheers all :)  Have a great day further!

00:58:16
<transcript>: What's it saying? Saying I have to pass a choice.

00:58:16
<transcript>: how do i make

00:58:18
<transcript>: How do I make it optional.

00:58:22
<transcript>: How do I someone tell me how I make it optional over here.

00:58:30
<transcript>: Oh, There we go.

00:58:33
<transcript>: Twisted is now optional.

00:58:36
<transcript>: This should be string? We're in the find? Yeah, Yeah.

00:58:39
<transcript>: Okay.

00:58:39
<transcript>: like

00:58:41
<transcript>: Like the answer.

00:58:43
<transcript>: So.

00:58:43
<transcript>: here

00:58:45
<transcript>: Here.

00:58:48
<transcript>: What's wrong with this.

00:58:49
<transcript>: could round

00:58:51
<transcript>: Could round be undefined Yeah.

00:58:56
delvoid: enjoy the food daryn_dev

00:59:05
<transcript>: Let's just say this unexpired if not round return. I don't know. This all feels really bad when I do that kind of thing because it's like what are the conditions where on expired would be called with no round? I don't know, but seems bad.

00:59:09
cowfacedude99: won't there be a timeout for a few sec showing the correct answer before starting a new round when the round is expired?

00:59:18
<transcript>: I guess handle expired should be actually no, it should just be. I don't need handle expired. We just call handle result.

00:59:20
<transcript>: Right.

00:59:20
<transcript>: yeah

00:59:22
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:59:25
<transcript>: i'm doing the wrong

00:59:25
<transcript>: Sorry? What.

00:59:27
<transcript>: I'm doing the wrong thing.

00:59:27
<transcript>: i'm going to do

00:59:29
<transcript>: I'm going to do Gr. Yeah.

00:59:29
<transcript>: result

00:59:30
<transcript>: Result.

00:59:34
<transcript>: Okay. So we can delete this.

00:59:51
<transcript>: Okay.

00:59:59
<transcript>: So on expired we call anti mutation let's see.

01:00:01
<transcript>: First.

01:00:01
<transcript>: we

01:00:09
<transcript>: We should we should do something here to prevent it from double firing. Right. So we want to answer that. We want to say.

01:00:12
<transcript>: If round.

01:00:13
cowfacedude99: or will there be a button showing `next round`?

01:00:14
<transcript>: Or.

01:00:17
<transcript>: Answer mutation.

01:00:19
<transcript>: Is.

01:00:22
<transcript>: Loading.

01:00:25
<transcript>: Right.

01:00:32
<transcript>: I just don't want to call it twice. So once we call this.

01:00:32
<transcript>: we hand

01:00:34
<transcript>: We handle the result.

01:00:39
<transcript>: And then handle result.

01:00:45
<transcript>: So here and then we do this whole thing. I should move this into a function, I guess.

01:00:53
<transcript>: We could do the whole thing, actually. Right.

01:00:56
<transcript>: Answer.

01:00:59
<transcript>: Do I need to do this whole thing.

01:01:08
<transcript>: I guess it could just be handled. Answer. We just call this thing right.

01:01:08
<transcript>: so

01:01:10
<transcript>: So.

01:01:12
<transcript>: Like this, right.

01:01:15
<transcript>: Answer.

01:01:21
<transcript>: Can be choice can be optional is what I'm getting at.

01:01:27
<transcript>: Okay.

01:01:30
<transcript>: So if you didn't answer in time we answer for you.

01:01:34
<transcript>: Choice would then be undefined.

01:01:38
<transcript>: Okay, then we can just call handle, answer.

01:01:42
<transcript>: Right. And it'll do all the stuff.

01:01:45
<transcript>: So here on expired we just do.

01:01:50
<transcript>: Need on expired then.

01:01:53
<transcript>: Let's just DAFF that.

01:01:56
<transcript>: And then here.

01:01:56
<transcript>: handle

01:01:59
<transcript>: Handle, answer.

01:02:09
<transcript>: Syntax somewhere.

01:02:09
<transcript>: oh

01:02:10
<transcript>: Oh.

01:02:12
<transcript>: I haven't I do this.

01:02:14
<transcript>: Oh.

01:02:17
<transcript>: No.

01:02:21
<transcript>: I deleted too much somewhere.

01:02:30
<transcript>: Oh, Trippy, what did I do? Let's see.

01:02:30
<transcript>: that

01:02:37
<transcript>: That set interval handle. What is that? I believe at the beginning of this function.

01:02:44
<transcript>: Right. That use effect. So can I not dash that? Oh, yeah, it's deleting too much.

01:02:44

01:03:09
<transcript>: Oh, what's wrong here? Oh, yeah. We need to wrap it in.

01:03:13
<transcript>: Yeah? Yeah? We need to make this.

01:03:18
<transcript>: Handle, answer.

01:03:30
<transcript>: And then we're gonna put it in a.

01:03:34
<transcript>: Use callback right.

01:03:36
<transcript>: Back that use callback.

01:03:40
<transcript>: Oh, Geez, it's ten.

01:03:48
<transcript>: Okay.

01:03:54
<transcript>: What's wrong.

<transcript>: Okay.

01:04:14
<transcript>: We gotta move it, we're gonna move.

01:04:17
<transcript>: Oh, I just ended that.

01:04:35
<transcript>: Worked? Let's just test her real quick and then I gotta go.

01:04:41
<transcript>: Why use call back because we were using it. Is it a it's a dependency and another hook.

01:04:41
<transcript>: what

01:04:44
<transcript>: okay

01:04:44
<transcript>: What is this? Code build.

01:04:47
<transcript>: Okay, let's let one expire and just see what it does.

01:04:55
<transcript>: It want to be a timeout for a few seconds during the correct answer for the starting area. Yes, I believe so. Cafes, we're about to find out here.

01:04:55
yetieaterxb1: Ah didnt see the dependency thanks!

01:05:01
<transcript>: See you, Darren. Sorry, I miss it. Okay. It should show us the correct answer. Oh, it's doing it in an infant loop. Okay. On the note.

01:05:04
<transcript>: On that note.

01:05:08
<transcript>: We gotta end it? I'm running over my wife's looking for me.

01:05:13

<transcript>: Welcome, welcome.

01:05:30
<transcript>: for

01:05:30
<transcript>: So, Kathy, she said, Won't there be a timeout.

01:05:43
<transcript>: i basically just

01:05:43
<transcript>: For a few seconds, showing the correct answer before starting a new round. When this the round is expired. Yeah. I think if we do it right, if I don't have an infinite loop, I think that's the behavior it won't show a button. It'll just like take you to the next one, just like it does when you answer.

01:05:45
<transcript>: not right

01:05:45
<transcript>: I basically just answered no for you.

01:05:46
