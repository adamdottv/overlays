<transcript>: Be tracking application Most likely.

<transcript>: I have to fix something.

00:12:30

<transcript>: Yeah. Every time I come down here, I have to, like, fix something.

00:12:38
<transcript>: like

00:12:41
<transcript>: Like I don't know. My setup's too complicated.

00:12:45
<transcript>: I need just like one button where I can press the button and I'm streaming.

00:12:45
<transcript>: and it

00:12:47
<transcript>: And it does everything.

00:12:47
cowfacedude99: the earliest I had seen you was 4o'clock my time

00:12:58
<transcript>: and sometimes i

00:13:04
<transcript>: And sometimes I just don't know what I'm gonna do? And I have no, I have no, like, creative juices flowing.

00:13:04
<transcript>: and i

00:13:07
<transcript>: And I spend 20 minutes just thinking of something.

00:13:07
<transcript>: i'll just turn

00:13:11
<transcript>: I'll just turn on the recording and see if it sparks creativity.

00:13:17
<transcript>: So there's some interesting recordings on my machine that I've never shared.

00:13:23
<transcript>: Earlier she's seen me was 04:00 calf face. What time would that be.

00:13:48
<transcript>: just seems

00:13:54
<transcript>: Just seems to change in my Chroma key will be off and I have to fix the Chroma key. It's still not perfect.

00:14:18
2dorkstv: even if it's not perfect, your production value is top notch for twitch :)

00:14:18
<transcript>: I just. Yeah, I feel like the quality is not as good and I have to tweet it all the time to get the Chroma key just right I need to get I guess I need some dedicated green screen lights. I guess I don't want to do it because it was taking up so much more room in my office.

00:14:18
<transcript>: six

00:14:23
<transcript>: Six in the evening. And you saw me at 04:00 a.m. My time once.

<transcript>: Yeah, yeah 2 hours earlier than this.

00:14:56
jaystation3x: Just kick over the green screen. Done.

00:14:57
hypermanu: how did you make that background?

00:15:09
<transcript>: That's about right. I did stream the first week or two, maybe the first two weeks. I streamed at, like, 430 in the morning, my time. And that's when I was in my early. I just go through seasons, I guess through seasons of high. And like, where I'm really I can't sleep. I want to get up. I'm so excited to work on something. And I go through seasons like this where I'm just, like, another hour.

00:15:09
<transcript>: wouldn't hurt

00:15:09
stroopwafel26: Throw a larabar at the green screen

<transcript>: i can

00:16:12
<transcript>: I can roll it up hypermanu? Welcome to Chad.

00:16:15
jaystation3x: "basement of the dentist office" is somehow a terrifying phrase.

00:16:17
<transcript>: How did you make that background? The background is my office.

00:16:17
<transcript>: it's actually

00:16:24
<transcript>: It's actually even the office. That's it like it's even lined up, just like this. Like that's. Just what's behind me? There's a green screen.

00:16:24
<transcript>: and i did the

00:16:26
<transcript>: And I did the because I wanted to.

00:16:35
<transcript>: I wanted to put stuff behind me. I still haven't done it. I haven't gotten to the point where I'm putting stuff between me and the office. Well, I've got some, like, examples. What's this one.

00:16:35
<transcript>: so like i

00:16:41
<transcript>: So like I could put stuff between me in the office, right. If I do this, there's a conference I want to talk about.

00:16:43
<transcript>: Not gonna talk about it right now.

00:16:49
<transcript>: Yeah. So that's why that's why I have a green screen, even though that is what my office looks like right behind me.

00:16:49
<transcript>: all the light

00:16:54
<transcript>: All the lights are off right now, but other than that throw a large part of the green screen.

jaystation3x: I am making... something... at this very moment.

<transcript>: Those are great animations.

00:19:30
stroopwafel26: Coffee, like alcohol, i feel like messes with my running

00:19:33
<transcript>: If you would like to create an animation for my stream.

00:19:33
<transcript>: the

00:19:37
<transcript>: The overlays repo. I just merged a PR yesterday.

00:19:37
<transcript>: you can like

<transcript>: You can like do stuff in here and change my Twitch overlays so.

00:19:42
<transcript>: here's

00:19:47
<transcript>: Here's when Shrew came in and made.

00:19:51
<transcript>: This animation you just saw. So there's a totally.

00:19:53
<transcript>: Stuff with math.

00:19:53
<transcript>: and you create

00:19:55
<transcript>: And you create a Stinger animation.

00:19:55
<transcript>: and then it'll

00:19:58
<transcript>: And then it'll randomly get selected.

00:19:58
<transcript>: and you'll get

00:20:13
<transcript>: And you'll get credit. See, author Shrew. So then you get credit for it. I don't know why I'm showing this. I really don't care if you do it, but it's just kind of fun. It's kind of a fun little thing we did on the stream. Thank you for the follows. Wow. Travis and Sebastian and Johnny.

00:20:15
<transcript>: In sykhard.

00:20:15
<transcript>: securge

00:20:18
<transcript>: Securge. How did I miss.

<transcript>: so quickly

00:20:21
<transcript>: So quickly.

00:20:27
<transcript>: Sir, welcome to chat.

00:20:27
<transcript>: coffee

00:20:30
<transcript>: Coffee. Like alcohol. I feel like messes with my running.

00:20:30
<transcript>: yeah yeah okay

00:20:32
hypermanu: twitch is recomending you on the left bar

00:20:41
<transcript>: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So you had a running thing that you're into that probably solves a lot of my problems if I were into running, the problem is I dislike running as much as I love coffee.

00:20:41
jaystation3x: Does it no longer show in chat? The stinger credit?

00:20:43
<transcript>: The feeling.

00:20:43
<transcript>: of running

00:20:44
hypermanu: is that snapcam?

00:20:44
<transcript>: Of running.

00:20:44
<transcript>: i

00:20:47
<transcript>: I hate every second.

00:20:53
<transcript>: All right, so here's what I'm thinking.

00:20:53
<transcript>: we had an

00:20:58
fredkisss: adaminion LUL

00:20:59
<transcript>: We had an infinite loop when we ended the stream yesterday. Because, of course we did, because react. And I'm terrible at it.

00:21:05
<transcript>: But I think I know the answer. I think I know how to fix it.

00:21:10
<transcript>: Oh, I think the other thing I realized is these.

00:21:15
<transcript>: Functions in Zest stand. Am I saying that right? Zestand.

00:21:15
<transcript>: think for the

00:21:17
<transcript>: Think for the follow. Ermalist.

00:21:22
<transcript>: Is it? Yeah, no. Hyper. It is Snap came. Yeah.

00:21:22
<transcript>: twitch

00:21:35
<transcript>: Twitch is recommending me on the left bar. Wow. Thank you. Twitch. Does it no longer show and chat the Stinger credit it does. J I just. I saw it in chat and then I wanted to expand.

00:21:35
<transcript>: expand

00:21:36
<transcript>: Expand, expand.

00:21:36
<transcript>: one

00:21:41
<transcript>: One into say more words about it. So these functions.

00:21:49
<transcript>: These functions can do whatever I want, right? They can be asynchronous. In fact, this one is a synchronous. So, like in here.

00:21:49
<transcript>: we

00:21:57
<transcript>: We could do more than just sell state. We can actually make, like, mutation. Oh, no, we can't do mutations. We can't do mutations because.

00:22:04
<transcript>: I guess we could pack the mutation in Is that ugly? What do people do.

00:22:04
<transcript>: anybody in

00:22:06
<transcript>: Anybody in here that uses.

00:22:09
<transcript>: I wish Next was here.

00:22:14
<transcript>: Next would have.

00:22:14
<transcript>: all the

00:22:16
<transcript>: All the answers.

00:22:16
jaystation3x: Huh. Didn't show on my phone.

00:22:19
<transcript>: I wonder like if I should be actually doing.

00:22:31
<transcript>: All the work in here, not just I was kind of using Zestane to just manage, like, basically wrap up on the usetates. So I'm not just like I don't have like, five use States. I just have, like my Zestan store.

00:22:31
<transcript>: but

00:22:40
<transcript>: But could I also use it for all the side effects and stuff like when I need to interact with API. Should I do that in my Zestan functions? Maybe.

00:22:40
<transcript>: who

00:22:44
<transcript>: Who knows? Does anyone here know the answer to that question.

00:22:47
<transcript>: I would love it if you did.

00:22:47
<transcript>: i

00:22:52
<transcript>: I guess I could just Google. Like, do people use a stand for.

00:22:55
<transcript>: Interacting with their API.

00:22:57
restarted: You can, don't know if you should

00:22:59
<transcript>: Leave it for now.

00:23:01
<transcript>: But.

00:23:05
<transcript>: See.

00:23:05
<transcript>: we can at least

00:23:07
<transcript>: We can at least solve the.

00:23:12
<transcript>: Given the loop problem without really changing anything fundamental.

00:23:16
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow Dan.

00:23:16
<transcript>: crude

00:23:19
<transcript>: Crude Urio crew.

00:23:20
restarted: I do it in an app I have.

00:23:28
<transcript>: You can don't know if you should. You do it in an app you have. Okay, that's helpful. Restart it. Thank you.

00:23:28
<transcript>: so you

00:23:32
<transcript>: So you can don't know if you should. That's where we're at.

00:23:37
<transcript>: That's most of what I do in programming. I can. I don't know if I should.

00:23:45
<transcript>: Okay, we've got new game.

00:23:48
stroopwafel26: That's most of what I do ever

00:23:55
<transcript>: And we can choose. Okay. So when it when it eventually.

00:23:55
<transcript>: expires

00:23:57
<transcript>: Expires oh Geez.

00:24:01
<transcript>: When it expires. That's when we get into the infant loop, right.

00:24:01
<transcript>: oh it didn't choose

00:24:03
<transcript>: Oh, it didn't choose a new one.

00:24:03
<transcript>: that

00:24:06
<transcript>: That's a problem. Oh, it's already. It's freaking out.

00:24:10
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah. We got some serious state issues.

00:24:16
<transcript>: We got some issues that's a lot of mutations. Okay, let's just go ahead and close that.

00:24:24
<transcript>: Okay, so let's not start a new game until we solve this problem.

00:24:24
<transcript>: the

00:24:29
<transcript>: The problem is here in our timer, every ten milliseconds.

00:24:32
<transcript>: We're calling handle, answer.

00:24:32
<transcript>: we only

00:24:34
<transcript>: We only want to do it.

00:24:38
<transcript>: Once it expires, and then what would trigger this thing to run again.

00:24:48
<transcript>: So I need to restart the interval.

00:24:52
<transcript>: When there's a new question, right.

00:25:02
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:25:02
<transcript>: we can't

00:25:04
<transcript>: We can't we definitely can't just do this.

00:25:09
<transcript>: In fact, we might need to clear the interval here.

00:25:15
<transcript>: Then I guess will it just get paid up? Do not need to worry about it, is it just gonna get picked up as soon as.

00:25:33
<transcript>: Current greater than expires handle answer clear the intervals, so stop running this loop. Will the loop just get re? I think the single just get reexcuted yeah. When there's new round, right? Yeah. Or when the state changes.

00:25:39
<transcript>: Which could be a problem, because still state could change. And then we could rerun this. We shouldn't let's see.

00:25:42
<transcript>: What's an infinite loop gonna hurt.

00:25:47
<transcript>: Okay, we have square zero. What is this? Rover. Runner? Yeah.

00:25:53
<transcript>: I've seen this one. I know this one. Elemental live.

00:25:53
<transcript>: i don't know why

00:26:01
<transcript>: I don't know why that looks like a robot. Why elemental live look like robot. Okay, let's try just letting it expire and see if it handles it gracefully.

00:26:07
<transcript>: Nope. Definitely an infinite loop.

00:26:07
<transcript>: no good

00:26:09
<transcript>: No good.

00:26:09
<transcript>: okay

00:26:10
<transcript>: Okay.

00:26:19
<transcript>: Good at react. Anybody know.

00:26:19
<transcript>: it's been

00:26:22
<transcript>: It's been eight years now. Will it ever be any good at it.

00:26:29
<transcript>: So what we need to do is when it expires.

00:26:32
<transcript>: We need to.

00:26:35
<transcript>: Move into an expired state.

00:26:40
<transcript>: And then not run this code anymore. So this code.

00:26:46
<transcript>: If round.

00:26:51
<transcript>: There's no round. We return. Should we also return? If.

00:26:53
<transcript>: Current is greater than expired.

00:26:53
<transcript>: maybe

00:26:56
<transcript>: Maybe that needs to happen up top.

00:27:03
<transcript>: Does I guess those are just yeah, that's all the time in there.

00:27:17
<transcript>: What is actually looping? I assume it's that we're calling handle answer a whole lot, right.

00:27:22
<transcript>: How do you get rid of the Quick fixed list.

00:27:22
stroopwafel26: when is your new keyboard arriving?

00:27:31
<transcript>: I really hate that that thing popped up because it breaks my brain. I don't know how to get rid of it.

00:27:37
bausmeier: :cclose

00:27:39
<transcript>: Handle answer. So this is what we're calling repeatedly. I think.

00:28:01
<transcript>: You bows, sea clothes. Close the quick list. I don't have to like window, navigate to it. Do all that stuff I just did.

00:28:06
<transcript>: When is my new keyboard arriving troop? I don't know.

00:28:06
<transcript>: it's

00:28:07
<transcript>: It's.

00:28:07
<transcript>: supposed to

00:28:15
<transcript>: Supposed to be end of this month. I think they said the first rounds. I think I was like I preordered the day they made them available. Preorder so.

00:28:17
jaystation3x: Is that the Characorder?

00:28:18
<transcript>: Yeah, I think.

00:28:18
<transcript>: in the month

00:28:22
<transcript>: In the month. Unless. Because they built mine for me. Maybe they'll set it in.

00:28:29
<transcript>: Okay.

00:28:40
<transcript>: I think I'm thinking about this wrong.

00:28:40
<transcript>: i need to do

00:28:43
<transcript>: I need to do the thing where I take a step back, right.

00:28:45
<transcript>: Really bad about taking steps back.

00:28:45
<transcript>: let's

00:28:48
<transcript>: Let's look up some zestan stuff.

00:28:52
<transcript>: Is this and.

00:28:52
<transcript>: ap

00:28:56
<transcript>: Api calls. I don't know. I want to know. Like, should I be doing this.

00:29:04
<transcript>: When fetching state from API was thus standing us effect function. What is the best practice for doing that right now? I'm gonna do it very simply.

00:29:04
<transcript>: so

00:29:09
<transcript>: So there's their store here. They're calling their API.

00:29:15
<transcript>: And then in the US Effect, they're saying, Fetch mode.

00:29:24
<transcript>: Dark base agents seems to imply their multiple ways. This could be written to be more efficient in terms of performance, especially if my store grows more complex with more values.

00:29:34
<transcript>: Okay. No answers. Awesome.

00:29:34
<transcript>: should have stopped reading

00:29:36
<transcript>: Should have stopped reading that one.

00:29:38
<transcript>: Infinite render.

00:29:38
<transcript>: that's not

00:29:39
<transcript>: That's not.

00:29:39
<transcript>: the stand

00:29:42
<transcript>: The Stand's fault or the best practice is.

00:29:49
<transcript>: Here we go.

00:29:50
daryn_dev: And now?

00:29:56
<transcript>: No, I've got the car. Accorder J. I haven't taken out of the box yet.

00:29:59
<transcript>: Darren's, here.

00:29:59
<transcript>: yeah i haven't

00:30:02
silverdezign: hello hello

00:30:06
daryn_dev: Oh right. Cos you cut yesterday short

00:30:09
<transcript>: Yeah, I haven't taken the care cord out of the box. I think I'm gonna teach my son who's seven. I think he's gonna learn to type on a care recorder. That's my current thought.

00:30:16
<transcript>: Yeah, Darren, I don't normally stream on Fridays, but we're doing this Friday because.

00:30:16
<transcript>: i didn't stream

00:30:18
laytanl_: new snap filter LUL

00:30:20
<transcript>: I didn't stream yesterday. I just did that little hour stream.

00:30:26
daryn_dev: Cos we're special <3

00:30:31
schrew: morning adam! Did you sleep better last night, I know I did!

00:30:32
<transcript>: If you're using Rack query, you're going to be assigning Request unique query key. If you need to access the request in multiple different areas, you can simply use that same query query derivative. I'm not using Rat query. Am I.

00:30:39
<transcript>: No, I'm using TRPC.

00:30:44
<transcript>: Don't people use Tier PC and react query Should I be.

00:30:48
stroopwafel26: I was looking at getting a Mode keyboard but the Sonnet is back-ordered until February but even worse shipping costs a whopping $64

00:30:49
fredkisss: tRPC uses react query

00:30:55
<transcript>: I guess all of my stuff is like mutations. Do I have a single query.

00:30:56
cowfacedude99: trpc uses react query under the hood

00:31:01
<transcript>: Not that you don't use React query for mutations. I'm just saying, I just realized they're all mutations.

00:31:08
<transcript>: To your PC users rack wearing the hood gotcha thank you Fred, Kiss and Cow face.

00:31:10
<transcript>: Morning, Shrew.

00:31:18
<transcript>: Good morning, late. And here? Yeah. We got a new snap filter. I'm a minion? Can you see right through my eyes? Into my soul.

00:31:18
<transcript>: i mean

00:31:21
<transcript>: I mean into the words behind my face. Oh, Jeez.

00:31:23
<transcript>: So bad.

00:31:23
<transcript>: so

00:31:29
<transcript>: So, green screen. That's an issue. Hello, Hello, silver design.

00:31:34
<transcript>: Looking at getting a MOT.

00:31:34
<transcript>: motor

00:31:37
<transcript>: Motor until February. Yeah.

00:31:41
<transcript>: Shipping costs $64. Oof. There are very heavy.

00:31:47
<transcript>: They're quite heavy.

00:31:52
<transcript>: They're just really nice though, like the build quality on these things.

00:31:56
zol0: @adamdotdev im 30 mins deep into coffee alternatives since u said that lol, do you add some kind of mushroom powder?

00:31:59
<transcript>: I know the build quality is really nice, even though I haven't owned a ton of mechanical keyboards because I ordered that.

00:32:05
<transcript>: Advantage Kinesis 360, Kinesis Advantage 360 whatever it is.

00:32:07
<transcript>: I ordered that.

00:32:07
<transcript>: and

00:32:12
<transcript>: And I need to follow up with Sigmopho and make sure he got it. It's supposed to get on Monday.

00:32:25
<transcript>: I took it out of the box, and I had read that the build quality on it was so amazing. It stands above all with the other keyboards or whatever. And it was like, I don't know, it's plastic. It's okay. These mode keyboards, these things. They are.

00:32:25
<transcript>: solid

00:32:27
<transcript>: Solid.

00:32:27
<transcript>: they're

00:32:29
<transcript>: They're metal.

00:32:29
<transcript>: all over

00:32:32
<transcript>: All over. I'll just do this. Can you see this.

00:32:32
<transcript>: it's just

00:32:37
<transcript>: It's just a big block of metal. I have this, like silvery Polish bottom on mine.

00:32:40
<transcript>: They are fantastic.

00:32:45
<transcript>: Can't recommend them more highly. The folks at mode.

00:32:47
<transcript>: They know what they're doing.

00:32:54
<transcript>: Alright.

00:32:57
stroopwafel26: Mode should make shipping to NL cheaper :P

00:33:05
stroopwafel26: make it happen mode!

00:33:11
<transcript>: State management and React, I swear, has taken years off my life. I feel like every time I'm stuck on something or I'm just, like, burn out of something on the front end. It's because of state management and react. I should start using solid. That's what I'm.

00:33:11
<transcript>: zach is still here

00:33:13
<transcript>: Zach is still here. He's shaking his head. Yes.

00:33:18
<transcript>: I don't even think it's reacts fault. I think it's the way my brain works. I think that's the problem.

00:33:31
<transcript>: In 30 minutes. D. In the coffee alternatives. Since you said that you add some kind of mushroom powder, I do. Oh, so I'll send you the yeah, it's called. Let's see.

00:33:31
<transcript>: what

00:33:32
<transcript>: What is it called.

00:33:34
<transcript>: Four Sigmatic.

00:33:34
<transcript>: or

00:33:38
<transcript>: Or Sigmatic perform. I think that's exactly it.

00:33:43
<transcript>: Hang on.

00:33:46
<transcript>: Focus.

00:33:46
<transcript>: it might be this one

00:33:47
<transcript>: It might be this one.

00:33:52
<transcript>: Yeah. Four Sigmatic focus. Is this right here? I'll send you this.

00:33:54
<transcript>: There you go.

00:33:54

00:34:00
zol0: thank you

00:34:02
<transcript>: I pause.

00:34:02
<transcript>: to everyone

00:34:03
<transcript>: To everyone.

00:34:13
<transcript>: That's right. Mode. I'll talk to. I know a guy. I know a guy at mode. I'll talk to him. It's a small team.

00:34:18
<transcript>: They need to make it cheaper to Ship International. I will say.

00:34:18
<transcript>: shipping

00:34:18
laytanl_: thats some heavy tracking

00:34:23
<transcript>: Shipping internationally is expensive. I understand why some of these people don't want to do it.

00:34:34
cowfacedude99: there's Angry Miao Hatsu Ergo Keyboard. LUL

00:34:36
<transcript>: Yeah for real latent Google. Just if you guys click on that link, Google will know everything about you so either about me I'm not sure.

00:34:36
<transcript>: but

00:34:38
<transcript>: But that's a lot of tracking.

00:34:46
<transcript>: That feels like the Web today, doesn't it? Just looking at that URL just kind of reminds me of like every website I go to.

00:34:55
<transcript>: Angie, Meow. Hatsu, Ergo. Keyboard. What.

00:35:01
<transcript>: Is that cow face? I can't not Google that you type that in my chat. I'm going to Google that.

00:35:04
<transcript>: What in the world.

00:35:07
<transcript>: Whoa.

00:35:07
<transcript>: that's

00:35:09
<transcript>: That's something.

00:35:12
<transcript>: And robots make it look at that.

00:35:17
<transcript>: Inspired by the west world.

00:35:31
<transcript>: A small learning curve for lifelong health. See, everybody talks about this. I know Prime's really big onto this. Like, for your wrists, that these split keyboards really make a huge difference.

00:35:45
<transcript>: I'm 36. I think me and prime are very similar in age. Like I want to say he had a birthday really close to mine. So we're like basically the same age. I've got any issues I did once develop like a cyst on my wrist.

00:35:45
<transcript>: i

00:35:47
<transcript>: I looked it up. It was harmless, but.

00:35:47
<transcript>: it's since

00:35:49
<transcript>: It's since gone away.

00:35:49
<transcript>: that's

00:36:07
bausmeier: Split keyboard saved my wrists.

00:36:09
<transcript>: That's about the only thing I've had, like in my career, setting at a desk for hours on end. I've never had any risk trouble, but that doesn't mean you won't. And that doesn't mean it's not valid. This means I've lucked out using my normal keyboard. I don't know if I've just set the right position. I don't know. Or maybe it's coming. Maybe it's coming for me. Maybe the wrist issues are coming.

00:36:14
<transcript>: Yeah. Bass. I've heard that from other people.

00:36:14
<transcript>: thank you for the follow

00:36:16
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow VM. Surf.

00:36:17
2dorkstv: I switched to a split keyboard (zsa moonlander) and I feel like my back pain reduced

00:36:18
<transcript>: surface

00:36:19
<transcript>: Surface.

00:36:20
<transcript>: Thank you so much.

00:36:28
stroopwafel26: I saved mine by using trackball, can't use a normal mouse now, instant RSI

00:36:29
<transcript>: I switch this with Kim keyboard Zsa Moonlander and feel like my back pain reduce. That makes sense. It's all connected. Right.

00:36:29
<transcript>: it

00:36:30
<transcript>: It's all connected.

00:36:30
<transcript>: actually

00:36:33
<transcript>: Actually to follow kind of a Dev.

00:36:34
cowfacedude99: prime has had issues because he had some things at 30 I think. not sure of what.

00:36:36
<transcript>: You're really a Dev.

00:36:40
<transcript>: You're a real Dev, kind of a Dev.

00:36:46
2dorkstv: I can sit with my arms at shoulder width instead of scrunching. it's pretty nice

00:36:47
<transcript>: Alright let's actually I guess I gotta solve this I can't just keep ignoring it.

00:36:50
<transcript>: So the issue here is we have this use effect.

00:36:50
<transcript>: this

00:36:52
<transcript>: This is where we're.

00:36:57
<transcript>: This is where we.

00:36:57
<transcript>: are updating

00:37:03
<transcript>: Are updating the progress bar, so we'll timer bar. I'm just using a use effect with the set interval.

00:37:07
jaystation3x: I love having a 10-key and the cool keyboards don't include them.

00:37:07
<transcript>: I could have done that different ways. We could have done that with.

00:37:08
laytanl_: that angry keyboard is cool but not $1600 cool

00:37:20
<transcript>: Could have done that with like, an animation or something, but ultimately, when it gets to the expiration time, we need to fire off. We need to stop running this interval right.

00:37:26
<transcript>: So this interval should stop. I thought I was doing that here with clear interval.

00:37:26
<transcript>: i guess

00:37:28
<transcript>: I guess.

00:37:28
bausmeier: @stroopwafel26 I went the other direction and bought the cheapest mouse I could find, then forced myself to stop using it so much.

00:37:29
woycieszko: You should create own hook for date

00:37:29
<transcript>: The problem is.

00:37:29
<transcript>: state is changing

00:37:38
<transcript>: State is changing for this whole thing is rerunning in the interval is resuming but I think currently should still be greater than expires in that case right.

00:37:44
<transcript>: But then it would still run this it would run handle answer every time. So if we could somehow make sure.

00:37:44
<transcript>: handle

00:37:47
<transcript>: Handle answer. What did somebody say? See, close.

00:37:47
<transcript>: we

00:37:51
<transcript>: We could somehow make sure that handle answer I really wish.

00:37:53
<transcript>: Figure out why.

00:38:01
<transcript>: You know what? Maybe I should update all of my new VM stuff. Maybe we'll do that on Stream today.

00:38:03
<transcript>: What could go wrong.

00:38:08
<transcript>: Handle answer. So this thing's running.

00:38:11
<transcript>: A lot and we need it to.

00:38:11
<transcript>: be aware

00:38:21
<transcript>: Be aware of when it shouldn't run right? Is that the right answer? I really should just only call it one time. That would be better.

00:38:26
popcorntoohot: lol funny you mention neovim, i was just thinking of updating my config

00:38:31
<transcript>: That Angry keyboard is cool, but it's $1600 Geez.

00:38:37
<transcript>: Promise that issues because he had some things at 30 I think not sure what save my.

00:38:37
<transcript>: using

00:38:41
<transcript>: Using a track ball can't use a normal mouth down.

00:38:45
<transcript>: There are dangers in our profession.

00:38:45
<transcript>: when you

00:38:46
<transcript>: When you sit this long.

00:38:46
<transcript>: i'm

00:38:54
<transcript>: I'm just too sedentary. I really gotta figure out a way to be less sedentary. I did a Sandy desk for a while, and then now I just have a sitting desk.

00:39:03
<transcript>: Jay, you love a Timky? I used to think I would never want to keep up without a tin key but.

00:39:03
<transcript>: i don't

00:39:08
<transcript>: I don't miss it anymore. I guess. Like I realized I don't type numbers that often.

00:39:08
<transcript>: and it is my

00:39:09
laytanl_: I saw a neovim plugin that throttles repeated key uses and instantly thought about you with the hjkl's

00:39:12
<transcript>: And it is my savatin key. When I'm typing numbers, I just don't do it very often.

00:39:24
<transcript>: With the other direction about the cheapest master. Define forced me to stop using this. That was my strategy, Bouse. So I got a trackpad thinking it'd be frustrating enough that I wouldn't use it.

00:39:24
<transcript>: i ended up

00:39:29
<transcript>: I ended up adapting and using it a lot, but then I finally jumped into them and taste it better.

00:39:29
<transcript>: voice

00:39:32
<transcript>: Voice you should create your own hook for date.

00:39:32
<transcript>: oh

00:39:35
<transcript>: Oh okay.

00:39:35
<transcript>: so you're saying

00:39:37
<transcript>: So you're saying for the timer thing.

00:39:44
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Popcorn. Funny Man. You mentioned yoga, and I was just thinking about doing my config.

00:39:48
<transcript>: We could do it together let me know when you do it and I'll do it.

00:39:48
<transcript>: song

00:39:54
<transcript>: Song You've been plugin that Throttle's repeated key uses and instantly thought about you with HG.

00:40:03
<transcript>: Hey, that's actually a great idea. Then in my the rest of my machine wouldn't have to have this super slow key. Repeat, if I could just have it Neil them. That would be great.

00:40:12
<transcript>: So you're saying moist or voice that we should have a hook.

00:40:20
<transcript>: Clean up our stuff with this use effect should be a hook that handles our archiver.

00:40:20
laytanl_: I forgot the name of it, let me see

00:40:24
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:40:24
<transcript>: now we can have like

00:40:27
<transcript>: Now we can have like a use elapsed or something.

00:40:29
stroopwafel26: key repeat speed all the way to the right, can't use a Mac any other way

00:40:31
<transcript>: Do that.

00:40:42
jaystation3x: People who format Word documents with the spacebar need that plugin.

00:40:45
<transcript>: You know what? Here's the thing. This doesn't need to be real time.

00:40:48
<transcript>: This doesn't need to be real time.

00:40:53
<transcript>: So.

00:40:53
<transcript>: this

00:41:03
<transcript>: This needs to like. We need to only change the timer when the state is active. That'll be real time, but we don't need to fire it off immediately. We can wait until it comes back.

00:41:05
<transcript>: So like when.

00:41:12
<transcript>: No, none. No. We have to actually send off a request. We're not going to send off.

00:41:18
<transcript>: Like we're not gonna send off the request to the server to get the right answer.

00:41:28
<transcript>: Nothing's gonna do that for us. We have to listen somehow to the timer and do that.

00:41:30
<transcript>: So maybe.

00:41:33
<transcript>: We have a separate user use effect.

00:41:37
laytanl_: Found it: https://github.com/ja-ford/delaytrain.nvim

00:41:39
<transcript>: I just always throw use effect of the problem.

00:41:47
<transcript>: Okay. So this use effect could just be based on elapsed, which is constant. I mean, this is constantly changing.

00:41:50
<transcript>: Elapse is every ten milliseconds.

00:41:57
<transcript>: But we could say if.

00:42:00
<transcript>: Lapse.

00:42:03
<transcript>: Equal to hundred.

00:42:06
<transcript>: Right.

00:42:13
<transcript>: How is this better? Is this even better? I think I was just trying to prevent, like something else from rerendering this thing.

00:42:17
popcorntoohot: I mean i still have to transfer my config to lua so I have a lot of work ahead of me

00:42:19
<transcript>: Like a new round.

00:42:19
<transcript>: but if i

00:42:21
delvoid: Heyooo

00:42:22
<transcript>: But if I just did handle answer in here.

00:42:28
<transcript>: Then I obviously have to do this.

00:42:37
<transcript>: But could I do that? Could I just say if Elapse is greater than equal to hundred handle answer, and then we make handle, answer.

00:42:37
<transcript>: quick fix

00:42:39
<transcript>: Quick fix. I don't like it.

00:42:50
<transcript>: Can we make this thing aware enough to not double fire? So if you if you call it in, that mutation is already running this one.

00:42:50
<transcript>: we can try

00:42:52
<transcript>: We can try that. I don't love it.

00:42:52
<transcript>: if not

00:42:56
<transcript>: If not round or answer mutations.

00:42:56
<transcript>: is loading

00:42:57
<transcript>: Is Loading.

00:43:01
<transcript>: Turn. I don't know. This might work.

00:43:03
<transcript>: Doesn't feel great.

00:43:10
<transcript>: Let's try it.

00:43:18
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow MVD in eight, one, six axis.

00:43:18
<transcript>: oh geez

00:43:21
<transcript>: Oh, Geez, I'm gonna expire right off the bat.

00:43:22
sockthedev: these useEffect backflips. feels like a state machine is needed instead.

00:43:25
<transcript>: I was intending to do that. Okay. So it's still it's looping.

00:43:29
<transcript>: See that that's not good.

00:43:33
<transcript>: It's better than it was.

00:43:36
<transcript>: That's not great.

00:43:47
<transcript>: Way to do this. I don't want to dip down into.

00:43:49
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:43:49
<transcript>: that's funny so

00:43:50
beardage: good morning adam!

00:43:56
<transcript>: That's funny sock. I just saw your message. I was just thinking, I don't know if I want to dip into X state. I'm getting.

00:43:56
<transcript>: too old

00:43:58
<transcript>: Too old my head.

00:43:58
<transcript>: i'm just

00:44:00
<transcript>: I'm just not used X state.

00:44:10
<transcript>: I'm gonna use it a little bit on stream. Oh, you found a delay train. That sounds awesome. I'm copying it. I'm taking it over here.

00:44:12
<transcript>: So.

00:44:18
<transcript>: Can you just stop repeating keys? Love it.

00:44:26
<transcript>: Yeah. Frustrating. But in a good way. Right.

00:44:32
<transcript>: Yeah, this looks great. We'll add it when we I'm gonna update all my plugins. We'll add in a minute.

00:44:34
daryn_dev: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

00:44:45
<transcript>: Double it's here. Hey, o, double wood popcorn. I mean it's. I still have to transfer my config to Luis. I have a lot of work ahead of me. Oh, I was just gonna, like, update all the packages in mine.

00:44:45
<transcript>: so

00:44:47
daryn_dev: Why is the broken cowboy hat so expensive

00:44:51
daryn_dev: :'(

00:44:57
<transcript>: So suck these. Use it back. Lips. Feel like a state machine is needed. I think you're right. I think is the X state. I can actually time transitions. I could actually have X state go to a transition after a certain amount of time. Right.

00:44:59
<transcript>: Good Morning. Beardage.

00:45:04
<transcript>: No. What happened? Darren? Why is the broken cowboy hat so soon.

00:45:06
<transcript>: Cuz it's broken.

00:45:12
<transcript>: There's a pull request on my overlays to change the price.

00:45:12
<transcript>: i'll take it

00:45:14
<transcript>: I'll take it under advisement.

00:45:20
daryn_dev: xD

00:45:20
<transcript>: Alright.

00:45:23
laytanl_: Just like animadam :'(

00:45:24
<transcript>: Are we doing it? Are we X dating.

00:45:25
stroopwafel26: imagine spending 1 million points on a broken hat

00:45:31
gusfringiscool: do u use nextauth?

00:45:32
<transcript>: Are we gonna do X state? Is it finally time to just tackle X state.

00:45:39
laytanl_: PR to 1 point

00:45:42
<transcript>: Guspring, welcome to Chat. I do use Next off. Not in this project yet. We're not. We don't have off setup yet.

00:45:42
<transcript>: but

00:45:43
laytanl_: everyone upvote

00:45:44
<transcript>: But.

00:45:47
<transcript>: Definitely something.

00:45:47
<transcript>: we

00:45:49
<transcript>: We will probably do.

00:45:49
<transcript>: but on most

00:45:51
cowfacedude99: there's https://github.com/takac/vim-hardtime too.

00:45:51
gusfringiscool: which one do u prefer

00:45:53
<transcript>: But on most projects I use next off I love Next off.

00:45:53
<transcript>: unless

00:45:55
<transcript>: Unless I start using solid.

00:45:55
<transcript>: i started

00:45:58
<transcript>: I started I guess I won't use necks off.

00:46:00
thdxr: I love xstate but don't use it

00:46:00
gusfringiscool: nextauth or firebase?

00:46:06
<transcript>: There's them hard time. Oh, that sounds nice.

00:46:09
thdxr: lot to bite off

00:46:11
<transcript>: They actually love X eight. You just don't use it.

00:46:15
<transcript>: What do you use to.

00:46:21
<transcript>: Use solid. Do you just roll your own stuff? I know you're not about that kind. Cognito life, right.

00:46:24
<transcript>: Or do you just deal with Cognito.

00:46:29
thdxr: SST has a new auth thingy

00:46:32
<transcript>: Which one do I prefer next sauce or Firebase.

00:46:35
<transcript>: I mean I use next off.

00:46:37
thdxr: it looks like next auth

00:46:46
<transcript>: Oh, FSD has off now and it doesn't use Cognito, right? It looks like next up. Okay, cool. So I could use solid. And the SSD thing. Do you have like a solid sight.

00:46:46
<transcript>: construct

00:46:46
gusfringiscool: @thdxr SST?

00:46:50
<transcript>: Construct in SS T for deploying solid sites.

00:46:51
gusfringiscool: what's that

00:46:55
popcorntoohot: idk why but I am very hesitant of using firebase

00:46:58
<transcript>: Sst is serverless stack.

00:46:58
<transcript>: max is what

00:46:59
popcorntoohot: just google... scarry

00:47:01
<transcript>: Max is what the serverless stack folk.

00:47:02
gusfringiscool: share me link

00:47:06
laytanl_: I like delaytrain because you can configure it to allow like 3 presses unthrottled and then start throttling it

00:47:07
<transcript>: I don't know why, but I'm very hesitant of using Firebase.

00:47:07
<transcript>: google

00:47:09
<transcript>: Google is scary.

00:47:09
gusfringiscool: @popcorntoohot but using firebase is fine too

00:47:11
sockthedev: SuperTokens is pretty quick/easy and free 5000 MAU.

00:47:14
<transcript>: Serverless Stack. What is your.

00:47:14
<transcript>: list

00:47:16
<transcript>: List.

00:47:19
<transcript>: I don't remember your domain.

00:47:20

cowfacedude99: aws has iam products right? why not use them?

00:47:30
<transcript>: I didn't mean to put that last. Well, where is that coming from? I don't know.

00:47:30
<transcript>: thanks for the

00:47:32
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow gust.

00:47:35
<transcript>: Aws has.

00:47:40
sockthedev: üòç SST

00:47:44
<transcript>: Cognito. I just. I've got my reasons. I know a lot of people have their reasons for not wanting to use cognitive Cognito.

00:47:48
stroopwafel26: IAM is for internal auth inside aws

00:47:55
<transcript>: I don't know the service that gets less attention. It seems like then Cognit like I don't feel like there's a lot of feature development happening on Cognito.

00:47:57
gusfringiscool: I've seen people bootstrap SaaS products to 50k$ mrr with firebase

00:47:58
<transcript>: Like that's one thing I know I've heard people say.

00:47:59
gusfringiscool: just firebase

00:48:05
<transcript>: That like some services, get lots of new features all the time. And they seem to be very actively.

00:48:05
<transcript>: improved

00:48:10
daryn_dev: Make Cow Boy hat cheap again xD

00:48:11
<transcript>: Improved incognito seems kind of stale relatively on the other end of the spectrum.

00:48:11
<transcript>: for

00:48:15
<transcript>: For me? Well, there's a lot of reasons I don't like. I don't know if I'm gonna go.

00:48:23
bausmeier: A project I just took over at work uses Cognito. Interested to hear opinions.

00:48:27
<transcript>: I don't know if I want to go into all of it, but if I don't want to just like kick the Cognito team. Assuming there is a Cognato team, I don't want to kick them all. They're down because I know they get a lot of Flack and the community.

00:48:32
<transcript>: Interested to hear opinions.

00:48:37
gusfringiscool: is sst good?

00:48:40
<transcript>: Darren. Five Sub gifts. Thank you so much. Darren. Look at you.

00:48:41
sockthedev: I added this, brand new user, to a Next.js project and had magic link auth working in 15m... https://supertokens.com/

00:48:46
thdxr: SST is OK

00:48:49
<transcript>: Sst is good. Gus Dakotax is very good at things. And he is he's a major part of SST.

00:48:50
2dorkstv: meeting time! be back in a bit

00:48:54
gusfringiscool: do I need to pay to use?

00:49:00
<transcript>: Of People Bootstrap SAS Products to 50,000 Mr with five base.

00:49:06
thdxr: it'll be really good in a few months

00:49:09
sockthedev: SST is the only way to do serverless based AWS dev imo

00:49:10
<transcript>: Yeah, Firebase is good, I think for the follow real diapen. So in my opinion Zon Cognito why do I not like konino? Okay, so.

00:49:13
<transcript>: Ssi is okay.

00:49:13
<transcript>: it'll be

00:49:18
<transcript>: It'll be really good in a few months. Okay. Okay. It's just okay nowadays.

00:49:20
<transcript>: See you too door.

00:49:23
<transcript>: Looking forward to seeing you back already.

00:49:27
<transcript>: You don't need to pay to use no, it's free.

00:49:35
<transcript>: I had this brand new user to an XJS project and had magic link off working in 15 minutes. Super tokens. What is that.

00:49:38
gusfringiscool: but t3 stack is my favorite

00:49:39
<transcript>: Next off is pretty fast. Right.

00:49:43
<transcript>: Like setting up next off and having something working with.

00:49:45
gusfringiscool: t3 is all u need

00:49:46
<transcript>: Magic Links is pretty fast.

00:49:46
<transcript>: open source

00:49:51
<transcript>: Open source user eyes quick to implement easy to customize so this works for any platform I guess like it's not.

00:49:51
<transcript>: limited

00:49:53
<transcript>: Limited to one.

00:49:53
<transcript>: stack

00:49:54
<transcript>: Stack.

00:50:00
<transcript>: Because that is one downside with Next sauce, though I think they're trying to make it.

00:50:00
<transcript>: not

00:50:03
sockthedev: yep

00:50:04
<transcript>: Not just for next. I think I don't know.

00:50:05
gusfringiscool: prisma+ next js + tailwinds + trpc

00:50:10
sockthedev: they have next.js example implementation

00:50:13
<transcript>: See the only way to do servos based AWS Dev in my opinion.

00:50:13
<transcript>: but t three

00:50:16
<transcript>: But T three stack is my favorite T three is all you need.

00:50:23
stroopwafel26: Look at that AWS Hero cup, humble brag

00:50:25
<transcript>: Prisma plus. Next you have plus tail in plus TRPC. They have next JS example implementation. Okay. So I'm going to look at the super tokens. That's interesting.

00:50:30
<transcript>: I have not seen this.

00:50:32
<transcript>: So Cognita.

00:50:32
<transcript>: someone wants

00:50:33
thdxr: plz stop using Prisma in serverless environments it kills me

00:50:35
<transcript>: Someone wants to hear someone listed here.

00:50:38
<transcript>: Oh, what this.

00:50:42
gusfringiscool: @thdxr why is that?

00:50:45
<transcript>: I really don't try to line it up. Can you see, like the letters coming off on this thing.

00:50:45
<transcript>: i like drinking

00:50:55
<transcript>: I like drinking out of it every day and I wash it too much so the letters are all fading and it's gonna make me really sad when it when the letters are all gone because I love this thing.

00:50:58
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow otaldo.

00:50:58
<transcript>: mighty cor

00:51:00
<transcript>: Mighty Core. Thank you so much for the prime setup.

00:51:00
<transcript>: i appreciate that

00:51:01
thdxr: Prisma doesn't work well in them and creates like 2+ second cold starts

00:51:05
<transcript>: I appreciate that. So I was just getting ready to talk about what? My thoughts on Cognito.

00:51:06
stroopwafel26: get a new one at re:invent, they have a mountain of swag

00:51:13
<transcript>: I just hate. I do hate how much I talk badly about certain services because I only ever talk badly about those services.

00:51:13
<transcript>: i'm like aw

00:51:16
<transcript>: I'm like, AWS is great. I love it. Except.

00:51:16
<transcript>: except for this team

00:51:17
gusfringiscool: @thdxr there's a way to limit connections

00:51:17
<transcript>: Except for this team.

00:51:17
<transcript>: it feels like

00:51:22
<transcript>: It feels like I'm saying that I'm not I'm not saying it's that team or those people that work on it.

00:51:22
<transcript>: just like

00:51:22
delvoid: @thdxr what would you suggest instead?

00:51:25
gusfringiscool: like create a global object

00:51:27
<transcript>: Just like the product as it stands. And it abuse wants to know this. They want to hear this stuff right.

00:51:29
gusfringiscool: won't that do

00:51:31
<transcript>: So what do I not like about Cognito? Well, the first thing.

00:51:31
<transcript>: first thing

00:51:32
sockthedev: t3 uses Prisma via API calls not in GSP

00:51:34
<transcript>: First thing I don't like about cognitive.

00:51:34
<transcript>: is

00:51:35
<transcript>: Is.

00:51:37
<transcript>: The confusion.

00:51:37
thdxr: it's not a conn issue, trust me I spent a lot of time on this

00:51:39
sockthedev: to account for the cold starts to a degree

00:51:47
<transcript>: That every time I go back to Cognito docs, I have to relearn the difference between identity pools and user pools, and I know it's probably super simple.

00:51:47
<transcript>: and everyone's

00:51:48
thdxr: we really tried to make cognito work at SST and we eventually we had to make our own auth solution

00:51:50
<transcript>: And everyone's always like, oh, it's really simple. It's just.

00:51:50
<transcript>: i know i most

00:51:50
sockthedev: but still think they should use Kysely

00:52:02
thdxr: kysely is what I've been recommending as well

00:52:03
<transcript>: I know I mostly use user pools, and I kind of mostly ignore identity pools. Maybe I just need to learn more about off, and I just don't understand enough of the underlying kind of fundamental concepts and off, but the whole, like.

00:52:10
<transcript>: To the split side of Cognito. Like where it's there's kind of two worlds, and they're very different, and they don't really interact.

00:52:10
<transcript>: that drive

00:52:26
thdxr: ApiG v2 is missing so many features it's sad

00:52:30
thdxr: like gzip!

00:52:30
<transcript>: That drives me crazy. It's kind of like API Gateway drives me crazy. Version one and version two because I never it's like every single time I have to rethink like which features work for which one it's the same as like Python two and three. I always hated Python before. Two is sort of deprecated. I hated the whole, like split in the community when half of people are like, no, you should only use Python two and then the other.

00:52:30
<transcript>: half like

00:52:37
<transcript>: Half like no Python three. And you got Pip three, and you got Pip, and you I just hate that stuff. So I definitely get.

00:52:37
<transcript>: those feelings

00:52:39
gusfringiscool: @thdxr isn't there any way to deploy next.js apart from vercel?

00:52:39
sockthedev: omfg. really.

00:52:50
<transcript>: Those feelings with Cognito. Like, when I look at the docs and I'm like, oh, first, choose your own adventure. Do you want user pools or identity pools? I get it. They're easy, whatever. It's probably super simple for a lot of people, but.

00:52:50
<transcript>: for me

00:52:51
<transcript>: For me. It's not.

00:52:51
<transcript>: so

00:52:54
sockthedev: they really need it CF fronted by default :(

00:52:57
gusfringiscool: like with prisma

00:52:58
<transcript>: So mostly user pools. So I build apps and I have a user pool. And I do off.

00:52:58
<transcript>: against that use

00:53:00
<transcript>: Against that user pool.

00:53:07
<transcript>: My problem is like if you want to do so the reason I love next off if you want to do like social.

00:53:09
<transcript>: Auth right? Like.

00:53:09
<transcript>: jot tokens

00:53:10
<transcript>: Jot tokens.

00:53:10
<transcript>: but you

00:53:13
<transcript>: But you want to do like social auth with Twitter.

00:53:13
<transcript>: and google

00:53:15
<transcript>: And Google, or whatever.

00:53:15
<transcript>: you've got

00:53:20
thdxr: using NextJS in a full-stack way is fine for a lot of things but nothing I work on can fit that way. falls apart as soon as you have any process that happens asynchronously

00:53:24
<transcript>: You've got like, all of them. Oauth is just implemented in that library for like, everything. And you can just, like, take it, add your secrets, you've got it.

00:53:28
<transcript>: With Cognito there's like three or four.

00:53:28
<transcript>: like

00:53:31
<transcript>: Like third party IDPs or whatever.

00:53:31
<transcript>: and i

00:53:44
<transcript>: And I get it. There's reasons Cognito it does things and you can't do it next off all the multifactor stuff and like SSO and all the things you can do that are more enterprisey. I'm sure people love that about Cognito I don't take advantage of that stuff.

00:53:44
<transcript>: i don't

00:53:46
<transcript>: I don't build for enterprise.

00:53:46
<transcript>: so maybe

00:53:54
<transcript>: So maybe that's why I don't like. I don't like it. I don't like those options. They don't help me. And then it doesn't have the basic social stuff.

00:53:54
<transcript>: that i like

00:53:56
<transcript>: That I like in next off.

00:53:56
<transcript>: then

00:53:59
otaldonunes: Hey hello guys, someone can please help me?

00:54:05
<transcript>: Then there's little like these are gonna be nits because I know these probably don't matter, but they bother me like the the multiregion story with Cognito is the disaster.

00:54:14
<transcript>: It's so bad because there's no way to really like, sync user pools. You have to, like, build it out yourself if you want to like.

00:54:14
<transcript>: sink

00:54:16
<transcript>: Sink across multiple regions.

00:54:16
<transcript>: and have

00:54:18
sockthedev: yeah, i wish Next/Remix et al. didn't promote doing all the things in their "backends". I feel like their backends should be more like BFFs rather than the actual backend.

00:54:18
<transcript>: And have.

00:54:18
<transcript>: cognito use

00:54:22
<transcript>: Cognito user pools at the base as like the foundation of your off.

00:54:22
<transcript>: that

00:54:35
gusfringiscool: @otaldonunes on what @otaldonunes

00:54:37
<transcript>: That's probably not a big deal. Like I guess you shouldn't do multiregion or something. I don't know. But like when a reason goes out, when I've had apps that were in USB span and had a cognitive user pool in US East One, and when US e four and caught on fire, like the Kinesis thing. I don't know, a year ago.

00:54:37
<transcript>: everybody

00:54:45
thdxr: @sockthedev exactly

00:54:47
<transcript>: Everybody was just out of the app. You couldn't log in, and there's not really a quick way to smooth your user pool over to another region. So that Stuff's annoying.

00:54:47
<transcript>: i don't

00:54:55
otaldonunes: Is there performance difference in Nextjs when i change a Image src conditionally or switch between two Images?

00:55:01
daryn_dev: @otaldonunes What's up?

00:55:07
<transcript>: I don't know anybody. I don't know. Emails have gripes about Cognito. I don't want to just sit here and pile on Cognito because it is a great I mean like it's super cheap. So when people are comparing like Cognito and off zero or whatever, it's way cheaper. And if they need the features that Cognito has around like the more enterprisey stuff, then it's a good call.

00:55:07
<transcript>: it makes

00:55:09
<transcript>: It makes a lot of sense.

00:55:09
sockthedev: at some point your app will need to graduate to more complexity, and then your backend is spaghetti in a framework.

00:55:19
<transcript>: I think it also just kind of trendy to bash on Cognito. So I think I jumped into that a little bit. It's hard not to be tainted by the community. And like people like me getting up here and talking about.

00:55:23
<transcript>: Okay. Now I'm trying to reach that.

00:55:29
<transcript>: Please stopping you please stop using Prisma and serverless environment it kills me.

00:55:34
<transcript>: I'm sure you're gonna expand.

00:55:34
<transcript>: why is that

00:55:38
nate_codes: HELLO ADAM HAPPY FRIDAY HOPE YOUR STREAM IS GOING AMAZING

00:55:41
<transcript>: Why is that? Okay. There you go. Someone asked. Prism doesn't work well in them and creates, like two plus second cold starts. Yeah.

00:55:41
<transcript>: yep

00:55:45
<transcript>: Yep. I don't think the stack as it stands.

00:55:54
<transcript>: Some of the T three stuff is not that performance, right? So Prisma being the main culprit, just anytime something's generating your SQL queries for you.

00:55:54
<transcript>: perform

00:55:58
<transcript>: Performance is probably not going to be fantastic, right.

00:55:58
<transcript>: not

00:55:59
bausmeier: I haven't worked with it long enough to have an opinion. But since you're bashing on it I'll join the club ;)

00:55:59
nate_codes: Prisma cold start fixes coming soon!

00:56:10
<transcript>: Not to not even speak into the cold starts. Get a new one at Reinvent. They have a mountainous swag. Get a new what? Oh, one of these cups. These things. Just give me a new one of these screen print hero on it.

00:56:13
nate_codes: But yeah prisma is awful in serverless atm

00:56:19
<transcript>: There's a way to limit connections.

00:56:19
<transcript>: what

00:56:21
<transcript>: What would you suggest.

00:56:28
<transcript>: T Three uses Prison via API calls, not in GSP.

00:56:31
fredkisss: @daryn_dev Thx for the Sub

00:56:31
<transcript>: Assign a connection issue. Trust me. I spent a lot of time on this.

00:56:31
<transcript>: the capricult

00:56:35
sockthedev: Kysely + Planetscala Data API driver FTW

00:56:38
<transcript>: The capricultury we really try to make work as to eventually had to make our own off solution.

00:56:38
<transcript>: still think

00:56:41
daryn_dev: @Fredkisss <3

00:56:42
<transcript>: Still think they should use Kaisely. This is it. I'm just reading.

00:56:42
<transcript>: you guys

00:56:43
sockthedev: You don't need to wait for perf

00:56:45
<transcript>: You guys all read this, like five minutes ago.

00:56:52
<transcript>: If I get Weaver version two is missing so many features. It is sad because I want to use it, but it's missing so many features.

00:56:56
sockthedev: * Planetscale

00:57:00
<transcript>: Isn't there any way to deploy Next JS? Apart from Versaille. I have answers to that question.

00:57:00
<transcript>: they probably already

00:57:06
<transcript>: They probably already been answered. Someone probably already answered it. Here we go. Using the XJS on a full spec way. It's fine for a lot of things.

00:57:06
<transcript>: but nothing

00:57:18
<transcript>: But nothing I work on can fit that way falls apart as soon as you have any process that happens asynchronously Hello at all, though. Welcome to Chat. Someone can please help you. What do you need help with.

00:57:18
<transcript>: i would

00:57:20
fredkisss: We don't see the screen

00:57:27
<transcript>: I would wish next remix at all didn't promote doing all the things in their backends. I feel like their back end should be more like BFF rather than the actual backend.

00:57:35
<transcript>: Exactly is their performance difference in actually this when I change image source conditionally or switch between two images.

00:57:38
<transcript>: Nate. Hello.

00:57:38
<transcript>: hello

00:57:42
<transcript>: Hello, Nate. Happy Friday.

00:57:42
<transcript>: it's going

00:57:44
realdiepen: Hi adam

00:57:45
nate_codes: @fredkisss neither can he, you can tell from the eye contact

00:57:46
daryn_dev: @Fredkisss He' reading chat :)

00:57:52
<transcript>: It's going amazing. Streaming always goes amazing because it's so fun. I love streaming some point. Your app will need to graduate to more complexity, and then you're back in this spaghetti and a framework.

00:57:52
<transcript>: yeah

00:57:53
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:58:03
thdxr: Planetscale + kysely is amazing

00:58:05
realdiepen: Have you used Amplify? I always found it more intuitive than firebase

00:58:08
<transcript>: Haven't worked with it long enough to have an opinion since you're bashing on it. I'll tell the club. Oh, no. See, this is what I don't want to do. I don't want to just like blanket say this thing bad, and then people don't use it because some guy that doesn't always talk about fitzo.

00:58:13
<transcript>: Prismacolor Figures Coming soon.

00:58:17
thdxr: if anything deserves a blanket bad thing it's cognito

00:58:21
<transcript>: Kaisely Plus Planet Scale Data API driver.

00:58:21
<transcript>: i

00:58:23
gusfringiscool: planetscale- I'm amazed by their generous free tier

00:58:27
<transcript>: I am aware of that data API driver. We mess with that on stream. I didn't do kaisely. We did view.

00:58:31
<transcript>: Which is its own kind of hell.

00:58:31
<transcript>: don't need to wait

00:58:32
nate_codes: STREAMER DIRECT OUR PITCHFORKS!

00:58:33
<transcript>: Don't need to wait for performance.

00:58:38
<transcript>: We don't see the screen. Yeah, yeah, I'm just talking to you guys. I'm just talking.

00:58:43
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Real. Hi, how are you.

00:58:48
<transcript>: Neither can he.

00:58:48
<transcript>: oh yeah

00:58:53
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, you can tell from the eye contact. Yeah, I'm just looking at you guys. I'm just reading chat.

00:58:53
<transcript>: planet scale plus

00:59:06
<transcript>: Planet Scale plus Kaisely is amazing amplify. I've always found it more intuitive than Firebase, so I gotta be honest, I don't have any Firebase experience which I feel like I should play with it just because.

00:59:06
<transcript>: context

00:59:12
thdxr: Adam say amplify is bad do it do it

00:59:16
stroopwafel26: That was a nice Cognito rant, now someone needs to ask Adam about Aurora Serverless

00:59:17
<transcript>: Context. Like if I'm interacting with other web devs so many people use Firebase. I should probably know how it compares. I have used amplify. Some. I don't really prefer using amplify either.

00:59:17
<transcript>: i think

00:59:18
theruggedbear: hey adam !

00:59:23
daryn_dev: I feel like I'm in the wrong stream now MaxLOL

00:59:25
<transcript>: I think I just I'm not the target audience for things like that because I've done too much infrastructure work and backend stuff.

00:59:25
<transcript>: that i just kind of

00:59:29
<transcript>: That I just kind of like using the tools I use and building stuff out.

00:59:29
<transcript>: but

00:59:35
<transcript>: But I will say I've been meaning to get back to amplify they've added so much in last year.

00:59:41
<transcript>: The ability to eject that to CDK stuff is really interesting.

00:59:45
<transcript>: And I just want to play with the Figma thing.

00:59:45
<transcript>: we can like

00:59:51
nate_codes: @adamdotdev I‚Äôm debating driving to twitch con without a ticket to sadly stream the exterior of twitch con while everybody parties inside FeelsBadMan

00:59:52
<transcript>: We can, like turn figment a react components. I'm just curious how well it works. That's. That's something I'm curious about.

00:59:54
daryn_dev: I've always been a dedicated Google/MS dev

00:59:55
popcorntoohot: having backend experience makes me skeptical of why I need to pay firebase. But maybe thats just me being cheap

00:59:58
laytanl_: Does planetscale lock you into using it or can you easily switch to something like postgres?

01:00:07
<transcript>: If anything deserves a blanket, bad thing. It's Cognito. You know, the thing is X. I never hear, like, from somebody who's, like, I'm on a Cognito Tet team. And that makes me sad. Like, I've never seen people from the Cognito team pipe up in the community. And then I start wondering, is there a Cognito team.

01:00:07
<transcript>: this

01:00:10
<transcript>: This is work on Cognito. Maybe not.

01:00:13
<transcript>: Maybe not.

01:00:17
<transcript>: Pitchfork.

01:00:21
<transcript>: Don't they have a vice bat? I didn't say that. I'm not gonna say it.

01:00:27
<transcript>: It's a nice Cognita rant. Now some of these ask out of about Aurora service.

01:00:29
<transcript>: You mean plant scale.

01:00:29
<transcript>: plant

01:00:32
<transcript>: Plant scale is the Aurora Service that never was.

01:00:36
<transcript>: Hey, rugged.

01:00:38
<transcript>: I guess. Aurora.

01:00:38
<transcript>: has

01:00:40
<transcript>: Has.

01:00:40
<transcript>: the post

01:00:41
stroopwafel26: HOT TAKE

01:00:47
<transcript>: The Postgres option. Right. So that is the one thing about Planet Scale is it forces you to not use Postgres.

01:00:49
gusfringiscool: switching to postgres will be troublesome

01:00:51
thdxr: embrace lock-in

01:00:52
<transcript>: There and you feel like you're in the wrong stream. Why is that.

01:00:52
<transcript>: why is that

01:00:54
<transcript>: Why is that.

01:01:00
<transcript>: Oh, you're going to Twitch, Connet. You're debating it. You live close enough.

01:01:04
<transcript>: Just stare at the outside of the building.

01:01:16
<transcript>: Did I make a hot tick? Did I embrace lock in, now, there's.

01:01:16
<transcript>: there's a

01:01:18
bausmeier: For Postgres there's also Neon.

01:01:19
<transcript>: There's a take I can get on board with.

01:01:19
<transcript>: loc

01:01:21
<transcript>: Lock ins. Not a thing.

01:01:22
nate_codes: Oh btw chat is Adam‚Äôs mom here? Twitter made certain promises‚Ä¶ ü§î

01:01:30
<transcript>: For Postgres. Always. Neon. Yeah. Is that? Is it like anyone can use it now.

01:01:33
laytanl_: "embrace lock in" when they can easily up the price later

01:01:39
gusfringiscool: neon?

01:01:39
bausmeier: Not yet I don't think.

01:01:42
<transcript>: Yeah. Patty, are you here? Patio more. Come in. Patty, can you hear me? She probably doesn't know Chad exists. If she is watching.

01:01:45
<transcript>: All right, let's actually go back to stuff.

01:01:48
nate_codes: One day‚Ä¶

01:01:50
gusfringiscool: never heard of it

01:01:52
thdxr: neon still in preview and it doesn't feel super serverless because you have to select cpu / mem rn

01:01:54
<transcript>: You know Layton, they don't up the prices, though. It always gets cheaper.

01:01:54
<transcript>: it'll be

01:01:56
<transcript>: It'll be just continues to get better and cheaper.

01:01:56
<transcript>: so

01:02:00
andom: What is this friday stream PogChamp

01:02:00
<transcript>: So feels good to be locked in sometimes to AWS.

01:02:08
stroopwafel26: One day Adam's mom will show her neovim config on stream

01:02:10
bausmeier: @gusfringiscool neon.tech

01:02:12
<transcript>: And what's going on? This is a rare Friday stream because I didn't really stream yesterday.

01:02:12
<transcript>: so

01:02:15
<transcript>: So I'm making it up by streaming today.

01:02:15
<transcript>: okay

01:02:27
<transcript>: Okay, what we're gonna do? We're gonna do up an excate. Is that what we decided? Every time I've jumped into X eight, I've regretted it just because it's like, I should spend a lot more time getting familiar with X state and.

01:02:32
<transcript>: Just jumping in on stream.

01:02:37
<transcript>: Wait. Excitement? Js.org.

01:02:44
<transcript>: That's cool.

01:02:50
thdxr: Adam.js.org

01:02:50
<transcript>: What do we think? Do you think I could quickly.

01:02:53
<transcript>: Quickly build out a statement.

01:02:58
<transcript>: Adam Js.org. Is that actually this 1 may actually have that.

01:03:06
thdxr: xstate is a big thing to learn

01:03:06
<transcript>: You just know I'm obsessed with domains, and I want to come up with a project called Adam. Now.

01:03:12
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow. Deveric. Deborah.

01:03:18
<transcript>: X eight is a big thing to learn. I do feel like for this game, that's kind of the thing I need.

01:03:18
<transcript>: i feel like

01:03:21
laytanl_: I remember you picked up a state library a few weeks ago and promptly removed it again LUL

01:03:25
<transcript>: I feel like I've got all these time transitions and I wish I could express those in zestanned, but I don't know.

01:03:25
<transcript>: how to do

01:03:25
beardage: I feel like it's a big thing to master but not huge to get going

01:03:33
<transcript>: How to do that? So just all this news effect gymnastics feels bad, and I think XA could be the answer.

01:03:38
beardage: but yeah this is a great usecase

01:03:39
<transcript>: I just don't think I would make much progress today if I jump down the X state hole.

01:03:40
thdxr: xstate probably would clean that up a lot

01:03:48
<transcript>: Yeah late. I think I've removed I've added and removed X state from like three projects now.

01:03:54
<transcript>: Okay. So beard just sinks. Maybe not so hard to get going.

01:03:54
<transcript>: it would

01:03:56
<transcript>: It would clean it up a lot. Yeah.

01:04:01
<transcript>: It's a great use case. Let's do it. Okay, you guys convince me. Let's do it. Here we go.

01:04:05
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow ZP Rd.

01:04:07
<transcript>: All right, Here's.

01:04:10
<transcript>: Date.

01:04:12
popcorntoohot: State libraries are such a commitment theres so much magic people put into it

01:04:12
<transcript>: Mpm install.

01:04:12
<transcript>: x

01:04:17
<transcript>: X state? What do I need? Xd and X. Eight. React or something.

01:04:24
gusfringiscool: I really don't like redux

01:04:25
laytanl_: !remindme 1 hour "has adam removed xstate again"

01:04:30
gusfringiscool: people just put it everywhere

01:04:32
<transcript>: I will say I need to say something to David. You know what I'm gonna add to my title? I'm gonna add the with X state because then David will just show up, and then you can answer all my questions.

01:04:34
<transcript>: Next JS.

01:04:38
<transcript>: And X state.

01:04:41
<transcript>: Okay.

01:04:45
<transcript>: Done? I'm updating the time.

01:04:46
<transcript>: It's like.

01:04:46
<transcript>: oh it fail

01:04:48
<transcript>: Oh, it failed to update.

01:04:52
<transcript>: This is like putting out the bat signal.

01:04:55
<transcript>: David will arrive shortly.

<transcript>: mo alley

01:04:58
<transcript>: Mo Alley. Thank you so much for the raid. Here we go.

01:05:01
<transcript>: raid

01:05:05
<transcript>: Raid? Welcome, Malalian? Friends? Welcome, welcome.

01:05:10
<transcript>: Remind me 1 hour Adam is removed exidica.

01:05:10
<transcript>: it's funny

01:05:11
<transcript>: It's funny.

01:05:14
<transcript>: Gus. I really don't like Redux either.

01:05:14
<transcript>: state libr

01:05:16
<transcript>: State Libraries are such a commitment.

01:05:21
<transcript>: There's so much magic people put into it. Yeah.

01:05:21
<transcript>: i do

01:05:26
<transcript>: I do get tired of all this use effect I wasn't gonna do. I was gonna update the title.

01:05:28
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:05:30
<transcript>: This one.

01:05:34
<transcript>: With next JS, and X state.

01:05:51
gusfringiscool: can anyone help me on one issue?

01:05:54
<transcript>: I'm literally just doing this in hopes that David will see, like one time he sent, he deemed me a working state machine for my problem because he saw it on stream. And that's how awesome David is. But one thing I would say today that is I get so confused when we've got guides, tutorials, recipes, patterns, and examples. I know those are all probably different things.

01:06:03
<transcript>: And like, maybe there's technical reasons why those are different. But for my brain, it's like, I want to get started. Those all sound like same thing.

01:06:06
gusfringiscool: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71751568/how-can-i-implement-device-based-authentication-with-django-drf

01:06:09
<transcript>: Do I want to guide or a tutorial? Or don't look at patterns or examples or recipes.

01:06:10
thdxr: writing docs is so hard

01:06:11
<transcript>: I don't know.

01:06:14
<transcript>: Can someone help me on one issue.

01:06:14
gusfringiscool: this question is not limited to django

01:06:22
<transcript>: Writing docs is so hard to I can't criticize. I don't write docs because I don't build things because I don't want to write docs.

01:06:36
gusfringiscool: just the general idea

01:06:36
<transcript>: But Seriously, Though, which one do you think? Anyone anyone know? Patterns, recipes? Ah, usage is react. Here we go.

01:06:39
<transcript>: So we're gonna install.

01:06:39
<transcript>: what

01:06:40
<transcript>: What.

01:06:51
<transcript>: Next state. And xDate react. There's some xDate react thing. Right.

01:06:55
<transcript>: Oh, here we go.

01:06:58
<transcript>: So X, eight.

01:07:02
<transcript>: And.

01:07:02
<transcript>: x

01:07:04
<transcript>: X state.

01:07:04
<transcript>: react

01:07:06
<transcript>: React. Okay.

01:07:13
<transcript>: I really want to get this thing out there. I think the A BS community will actually play it. I think once we have a leaderboard.

01:07:13
<transcript>: i know

01:07:15
<transcript>: I know. I'll spend some time on it.

01:07:16
gusfringiscool: @thdxr boring makes it hard

01:07:24
<transcript>: So use machine we've done this before.

01:07:24
theruggedbear: i have to write docs because i need to yield everything i've done at the current job :(

01:07:27
<transcript>: We have done it before.

01:07:30
popcorntoohot: !project

fossabot: working on awguess

01:07:31
<transcript>: I don't want to play with context. No, thank you.

01:07:31
<transcript>: can i not

01:07:33
<transcript>: Can I not use context.

01:07:37
<transcript>: Here we go. Create machine States.

01:07:41
popcorntoohot: !awguess

01:07:42
fossabot: awguess is a guessing game where you're given an AWS service icon and you have to choose the correct service! https://github.com/adamelmore/awguess

01:07:45
<transcript>: We're actually going to push through this time. We're gonna do it. We're not removing X state. Don't let me do it. Don't let me remove it.

01:07:45
<transcript>: somebody hold me

01:07:46
<transcript>: Somebody hold me accountable.

01:07:46
<transcript>: don

01:07:48
<transcript>: Don't let me.

01:07:59
<transcript>: Okay. We've we've installed the package.

01:08:01
daryn_dev: No more gifts if you remove XSTATE

01:08:04
<transcript>: I guess I'm removing Zest stand. Right.

01:08:07
<transcript>: Remove.

01:08:07
<transcript>: all of

01:08:10
<transcript>: All of this Zustend stuff.

01:08:18
<transcript>: Okay.

01:08:18
<transcript>: there goes

01:08:20
sockthedev: @daryn_dev üòÉ

01:08:20
<transcript>: There goes the stand.

01:08:20
<transcript>: beans

01:08:21
delvoid: if you remove it again you owe everyone in chat a new keyboard ;)

01:08:22
<transcript>: Beans, here goes all this.

01:08:25
<transcript>: Okay.

01:08:30
<transcript>: So now we need to create a state machine.

01:08:32
<transcript>: At the top of this file.

01:08:36
<transcript>: We're gonna import let's see machine from machine.

01:08:39
stroopwafel26: @Delvoid I'll take a Mode with free shipping plz

01:08:40
<transcript>: I'm just gonna put it in this file, use machine and use history.

01:08:44
sockthedev: excited to watch this process

01:08:52
<transcript>: I don't think I'm in the right place. I don't think this is the right starting place, is it.

01:08:55
<transcript>: Getting started.

01:08:59
<transcript>: What do we think.

01:09:01
popcorntoohot: same sock same

01:09:06
<transcript>: On resolve, on reject.

01:09:19
<transcript>: If you remove it again, you owe everyone and chat a new keyboard. Oh, Geez.

01:09:19
<transcript>: that's too many of you

01:09:21
<transcript>: That's too many of you.

01:09:21
<transcript>: no

01:09:24
<transcript>: No more gifts if you remove X state, okay, Darren.

01:09:27
<transcript>: Has been giving out gifts.

01:09:41
<transcript>: Okay. Well, let's let's find a good I need to like a good complicated machine. Like something that does lots of stuff so I can kind of get.

01:09:41
<transcript>: there's

01:09:53
<transcript>: There's local context. There's an initial state. Don't you create a machine with a type? I thought you I thought this game state might come in handy. I thought I would have like a type. Maybe not.

01:09:57
<transcript>: So here we go create machine.

01:10:04
thdxr: the context can have a type but xstate relies on codegen for more advanced stuff

01:10:08
sockthedev: Xstate visualiser btw https://xstate.js.org/viz/

01:10:09
<transcript>: Has an ID has an initial state. Here's the state's action reference via string entry alert green. So then actions of this separate thing here.

01:10:13
<transcript>: I don't know if those can be asynchronous or not.

01:10:19
<transcript>: With context. Okay.

01:10:22
<transcript>: I want to read a little bit about actions here.

01:10:27
<transcript>: Predictable action argument is true. Okay.

01:10:30
<transcript>: Actions to be added like so.

01:10:33
<transcript>: So this inactive state.

01:10:33
<transcript>: on trigger

01:10:35
<transcript>: On trigger.

01:10:35
<transcript>: we go

01:10:37
<transcript>: We go to active.

01:10:45
<transcript>: But then these transition actions. What's this about? So activate and sinful telemetry. So if someone calls these, it's saying it'll trigger.

01:10:50
<transcript>: This it'll trigger the move it to active is up the idea.

01:10:52
<transcript>: Entry, actions.

01:10:52
<transcript>: so those are

01:10:57
popcorntoohot: @Delvoid I'll take a Dactyl

01:11:03
<transcript>: So those are trigger or transition actions. These are entry actions. Entry, notify active. Sin. Telemetry. Exit actions, notify inactive syntax.

01:11:08
<transcript>: For the Follow Neil.

01:11:12
laytanl_: No it calls those actions when it transitions

01:11:18
<transcript>: The context can have a type, but X state relies on code Gen for more advanced stuff. Okay.

01:11:18
<transcript>: okay

01:11:21
<transcript>: Okay. Oh, yeah. There's a visualizer.

01:11:27
sociopotty: u look like Dean Ambrose ngl

01:11:28
<transcript>: It calls us actions when it transitions. Okay. Makes sense. But what about the entry ones.

01:11:28
<transcript>: that's

01:11:32
thdxr: rank your xstate regret out of 10

01:11:36
<transcript>: That's when it enters this state, it'll call those. And when it exits, it'll call these. Okay. That makes sense. Yeah, Yeah.

01:11:36
<transcript>: that makes sense

01:11:37
<transcript>: That makes sense.

01:11:40
laytanl_: exactly

01:11:42
beardage: if you go to recipes > usage w/ react, those docs made the most sense for me

01:11:47
<transcript>: When she's transition versus enter. Okay. They mean different things. Entry and X in action means xeutes action on any transition. Yep. That makes sense.

01:11:55
<transcript>: A transition action means execute this action only on this transition. Use transition actions when the action is dependent on the event.

01:11:55
<transcript>: and the

01:11:59
<transcript>: And the state node that it is currently in.

01:12:03
<transcript>: Okay.

01:12:09
<transcript>: So onload. Okay. So this is a transition.

01:12:09
<transcript>: now this

01:12:11
<transcript>: Now this is an event.

01:12:14
<transcript>: Is this an event.

01:12:21
<transcript>: What is this called? An event? Yeah. Onload so events. Let's read about events. An event is what caused.

01:12:21
<transcript>: causal state

01:12:22
popcorntoohot: I think he was there before

01:12:28
<transcript>: Causal state machine to transition from its current state to its next state. Learn More Read the Events section in our Introduction to State chart.

01:12:34
<transcript>: Okay.

01:12:36
<transcript>: Timer event.

01:12:43
<transcript>: Sending events. Here we go.

01:12:43
<transcript>: so we

01:12:44
<transcript>: So we transition.

01:12:47
thdxr: I learned xstate by playing around in the visualizer fwiw

01:12:48
<transcript>: We have our machine. We transition.

01:12:50
<transcript>: Initial state.

01:12:50
<transcript>: time

01:12:51
<transcript>: Timer.

01:13:01
<transcript>: Interpret mass machine start and then mouse search send so it'll be some way on the actual.

01:13:01
<transcript>: machine

01:13:03
<transcript>: Machine or something.

01:13:04
<transcript>: To send to them.

01:13:04
<transcript>: okay

01:13:08
<transcript>: Okay. Makes sense. I think I've learned this, like three times.

01:13:17
<transcript>: You learned it by playing around the visualizer. That's a good idea. Okay, let's do that. I guess that's why you sent me the visualizer. Somebody sent me the visualizer.

01:13:20
<transcript>: Thank you for that sock. The Dev.

01:13:28
<transcript>: It calls those actions when it transitions. Oh, you already read that? I look like Dan Ambrose.

01:13:28
<transcript>: who's at

01:13:30
<transcript>: Who's at I don't know who that is.

01:13:36
<transcript>: State regret out of ten I'm not regretting I'm pushing through this time.

01:13:46
<transcript>: I'm pushing through if you go to recipes, usage was react. Those documents made the most sense for me. Yeah, those weren't making that missus to me, but it could be that I just didn't have enough context.

01:13:50
sociopotty: WWE Wrestler

01:13:51
<transcript>: Or I just felt like those two simple of the machine. I'm gonna have to do some weed stuff, you know.

01:14:05
<transcript>: Okay, so can I play with it? Let's see. So this is a visualizer idle. Let's just go and start building out our state available variables. Machine, interpret assignments. Okay, fish. Machine.

01:14:08
<transcript>: Game.

01:14:11
<transcript>: Initial idle.

01:14:18
<transcript>: States we have Idle, we have active.

01:14:20
sociopotty: currently in AEW

01:14:23
<transcript>: Correct.

01:14:28
<transcript>: And we have incorrect.

01:14:34
<transcript>: I don't know.

01:14:36
<transcript>: And we have.

01:14:39
<transcript>: Expired right.

01:14:45
<transcript>: They do it too. Update.

01:14:48
<transcript>: In valve transition. I guess I've got to actually do something here.

01:14:55
<transcript>: Fetch goes to Loading. That's not what we want. So on.

01:14:55
<transcript>: start

01:14:56
<transcript>: Start.

01:14:56
<transcript>: game

01:15:00
<transcript>: Game is it snake tastes like that underscore.

01:15:00
<transcript>: or should

01:15:02
daryn_dev: Coffee break ‚òï

01:15:03
<transcript>: Or should I just name all my actions? One word.

01:15:06
<transcript>: Coffee break.

01:15:08
popcorntoohot: can you move the editor thing over a bit. You're blocking it

01:15:10
<transcript>: Enjoy that coffee, Darren. I'm not jealous at all.

01:15:15
stroopwafel26: tea break

01:15:16
<transcript>: Oh, I'm blocking it. I'm so sorry. Yeah. Let's move this over here.

01:15:18
<transcript>: Oops.

01:15:21
<transcript>: Here we go.

01:15:21
<transcript>: i'll do it on this side

01:15:22
<transcript>: I'll do it on this side.

01:15:26
thdxr: wait did you get a tiling window manager?

01:15:27
<transcript>: Okay.

01:15:27
<transcript>: so

01:15:28
<transcript>: So.

01:15:34
<transcript>: Start game can we do multi word.

01:15:38
sockthedev: can you please kick @thdxr - i need that cli done

01:15:39
<transcript>: Wait, did you get a tiling window manager? I use Yubai.

01:15:39
<transcript>: i always love

01:15:41
<transcript>: I always love saying you buy you bye.

01:15:45
<transcript>: Please.

01:15:48
thdxr: lol

01:15:51
<transcript>: Be working on Wait, who is Sock the Dev? I feel like I've heard of Sock the Dev.

01:15:54
thdxr: I'm procrastinating pretty hard

01:15:57
<transcript>: Have I heard of you suck the day.

01:15:57
<transcript>: on twitter

01:16:00
popcorntoohot: oooh yeah it seemed like a twm but also not really.

01:16:00
<transcript>: On Twitter. Have I heard of you on Twitter.

01:16:03
<transcript>: Maybe.

01:16:06
sockthedev: i new here

01:16:08
<transcript>: Yes, I've seen you. I've seen that sock.

01:16:12
<transcript>: I know I've seen you before.

01:16:16
sstorrm: Why wouldnt you move your GameState status into an enum and use that Enum instead

01:16:17
<transcript>: Okay start game goes to active.

01:16:21
sockthedev: oh i might have pinged you on twitter :D

01:16:23
<transcript>: Okay. I'm just going to pretend like I know what I'm doing. Sometimes you just got jump in and pretend like you know what you're doing.

01:16:23
<transcript>: id

01:16:28
<transcript>: Idol OnStar game go to active active on resolve.

01:16:28
<transcript>: on

01:16:30
<transcript>: On answer.

01:16:33
<transcript>: Well, I guess it depends. Right.

01:16:33
<transcript>: on

01:16:34
<transcript>: On.

01:16:38
<transcript>: Answer goes to pending.

01:16:38
<transcript>: and then

01:16:42
<transcript>: And then pending it depends on the result.

01:16:44
<transcript>: Not a final.

01:16:51
<transcript>: So how do I do, like, how do I express this on? So there's gonna be an asynchronous call when they answer.

01:16:51
<transcript>: we make

01:16:57
<transcript>: We make a call to the API, and we're gonna get a result back that's like that was correct or incorrect.

01:16:57
<transcript>: so

01:17:05
<transcript>: So depending on that answer, pinning will transition to correct and correct or expired. How do I express that.

01:17:09
<transcript>: I guess we'll just have events for each of them. So.

01:17:09
<transcript>: answer

01:17:11
<transcript>: Answer. Then there'll be on.

01:17:15
<transcript>: Correct. We go to correct.

01:17:18
laytanl_: on INCORRECT, on CORRECT etc.

01:17:19
stroopwafel26: I will follow a sock who's a web dev

01:17:20
<transcript>: On Incorrect. We go to.

01:17:22
<transcript>: Incorrect.

01:17:26
<transcript>: On expired.

01:17:26
<transcript>: we got

01:17:28
<transcript>: We got expired right.

01:17:33
<transcript>: Okay. On retry target. I just need to know some of these things. How this stuff works.

01:17:33
<transcript>: so

01:17:37
<transcript>: So actions assign retries context of Gees.

01:17:42
<transcript>: What so on retry.

01:17:42
<transcript>: we

01:17:46
<transcript>: We go to Loading, but we run this code.

01:17:46
<transcript>: okay

01:17:51
<transcript>: Okay. I don't understand that yet. So I'm going to.

01:17:51
<transcript>: ignore it

01:17:55
<transcript>: Ignore it. We're just going to call all these types. Final.

01:17:55
<transcript>: but they're not

01:17:57
<transcript>: But they're not really.

01:17:57
<transcript>: well they are

01:18:03
<transcript>: Well, they are. I don't know what is final because once you've gone, the final can you not go anywhere else.

01:18:03
<transcript>: they will eventually

01:18:05
<transcript>: They will eventually go back.

01:18:08
<transcript>: You know saying like the beginning.

01:18:08
<transcript>: let's just say

01:18:10
<transcript>: Let's just say we did this.

01:18:14
<transcript>: Okay, I don't start game.

01:18:14
<transcript>: we go to

01:18:22
<transcript>: We go to active. You answer it goes the pending. If it's correct, you go to crack if it incorrect. Okay, so this is the most basic.

01:18:22
<transcript>: like

01:18:26
daryn_dev: Final noun coming at the end of a series. "the final version of the report was presented"

01:18:33
<transcript>: Like modeling of our game state, right. We've made progress. We did a thing with X state, and we put it in our title. So before you know it, David will be here and he'll finish this thing.

01:18:37
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:18:43
<transcript>: This is Dex. Is progressing. You're at the gym, right, DAX? You're fine. You're working out.

01:18:47
<transcript>: It seemed like a TWM, but also not really.

01:18:47
<transcript>: twm

01:18:48
<transcript>: Twm.

01:18:50
bausmeier: Next add a delayed event for expiry

01:18:52
thdxr: I'm back from the gym, already got too big

01:18:53
<transcript>: Oh, Tyling, Window Manager. You guys know I'll have the fancy acronyms.

01:19:00
sockthedev: I have so few followers. thanks @stroopwafel26 üòò

01:19:03
<transcript>: Sock. You're new here. Yeah. I haven't seen you in my chat before, but I knew I had seen you somewhere on the Internet. You know it's a small world. I've seen you somewhere.

01:19:03
<transcript>: s storm

01:19:16
thdxr: neveruseenums

01:19:16
<transcript>: S. Storm. Welcome to Chat. Why wouldn't you move your gamestate status into an Enum and use that enum instead? That's a good idea. That's a great idea. Except what? I just use a discriminated Union instead of Indiana. I don't know. I generally do.

01:19:16
<transcript>: thank

01:19:21
<transcript>: Thank for the follow. Return to Dust and Ralpher. I appreciate those follows.

01:19:21
<transcript>: if i

01:19:24
<transcript>: If I haven't said so, I appreciate the follows because.

01:19:24
<transcript>: it means

01:19:32
stroopwafel26: @thdxr do u even lift bro

01:19:33
<transcript>: It means I think you'll be back. If I see you follow me, I assume that means you want to come back. And if you keep coming back, that means we get to hang out more gets nobody better.

01:19:38
<transcript>: All kinds of fun things. Come along with that. Oh, Geez, thank you so much for the follows, easy and Zam keys.

01:19:38
<transcript>: i appreciate

01:19:40
laytanl_: JS enums are a joke

01:19:41
<transcript>: I appreciate your follows just as much.

01:19:41
<transcript>: i appreciate

01:19:44
<transcript>: I appreciate all the follows. The same equally.

01:19:52
<transcript>: Might have pinged you on Twitter. Maybe that's what it was. Sock to Dev. I just. I've seen your little sock puppet face.

01:19:56
<transcript>: Leighton on. In. Cracked on. Correct.

01:20:01
<transcript>: What were you saying? Leighton? Did I miss something.

01:20:08
<transcript>: I will follow a sock who's a web dis.

01:20:10
<transcript>: dish

01:20:11
<transcript>: Dish.

01:20:21
sockthedev: i think the TS team regrets enums too

01:20:21
<transcript>: Next add a delayed event for Xbury. Yes.

01:20:21
<transcript>: okay

01:20:24
<transcript>: Okay. That's a good call. Bounce. That's our next thing.

01:20:28
<transcript>: Back from the gym already got too big.

01:20:28
<transcript>: that's funny

01:20:29
<transcript>: That's funny.

01:20:35
sstorrm: I guess because you can use it's key as a comparing attribute for later and you can name the value whatever you want incase you want to display the status

01:20:39
<transcript>: Never using NUMS. Okay. I had that intuition, Zach, somehow my gut, and just knew I shouldn't using numbs. So I'm glad to hear it explicitly said.

01:20:46
<transcript>: Okay. Tsm? Regrets? Enum. So. Okay, well, then I definitely won't use them.

01:20:55
<transcript>: Okay, let's let's do this. Let's figure out how to do it. Timed a times thing.

01:20:55
<transcript>: move this

01:20:57
<transcript>: Move this over here.

fossabot: awguess is a guessing game where you're given an AWS service icon and you have to choose the correct service! https://github.com/adamelmore/awguess

01:21:07
<transcript>: So we want to do timed. Let's see. Is there anything in here? Delayed events and transitions. Look at this. We're learning X state people third times of charms.

01:21:07
<transcript>: so

01:21:11
<transcript>: So green after 1 second transition to yellow.

01:21:11
<transcript>: okay

01:21:13
<transcript>: Okay.

01:21:17
<transcript>: What if what if.

01:21:17
<transcript>: what if i

01:21:19
<transcript>: What if I want to transition.

01:21:19
<transcript>: okay

01:21:24
<transcript>: Okay. Here's what I want to happen when we go into active.

01:21:24
<transcript>: okay

01:21:25
<transcript>: Okay.

01:21:25
<transcript>: when we go into

01:21:29
<transcript>: When we go into active after 10 seconds.

01:21:32
<transcript>: I want to move to expired.

01:21:32
<transcript>: unless

01:21:40
<transcript>: Unless one of those events happens, is there a way to let's see delayed events? Delay expressions.

01:21:53
<transcript>: The delay. I'm also be evaluated as a delay expression which is function. It takes in the current contact and event that triggered the send action returns to resolve delay in milliseconds. Okay. So if I have a dynamic delay, which I do.

01:21:53
<transcript>: the delay

01:21:59
<transcript>: The delay actually comes from the server. The server says, win the answer expires right.

01:22:02
<transcript>: I could just hard code it to 10 seconds.

01:22:02
<transcript>: then we can make

01:22:05
<transcript>: Then we can make that a lot easier. But.

01:22:10
<transcript>: I don't know. Is that what we want to do.

01:22:14
<transcript>: So on activate go to pending.

01:22:14
<transcript>: pining

01:22:19
<transcript>: Pining entry send an event on entry type finish.

01:22:19
<transcript>: so this

01:22:22
<transcript>: So this is where we're sending an event.

01:22:22
<transcript>: and

01:22:27
<transcript>: And then delay determined from custom event weight, property.

01:22:30
<transcript>: So it gets a context of that. Okay.

01:22:33
thdxr: you could move xstate to the server and just sync the context down...

01:22:34
<transcript>: So the event will be the.

01:22:38
<transcript>: New round event.

01:22:41
<transcript>: Right.

01:22:48
<transcript>: You've mech move X eight to the server and just sync the context down. That's a thing you can run X state on the server. I guess I make sense.

01:22:55
<transcript>: I.

01:23:00
<transcript>: Like use WebSockets to push the realtime stuff from the X state.

01:23:06
<transcript>: The Sound's hard but also pretty powerful.

01:23:16
<transcript>: Let's see delayed expressions. What's the difference in Belate event? Okay, so I can say.

01:23:16
<transcript>: sand oh

01:23:19
<transcript>: Sand? Oh, when I do? Here we go.

01:23:23
<transcript>: I can just send events on a delay.

01:23:33
<transcript>: You can also prevent those late events from being sent by canceling them. Okay. And that's kind of what I was getting at. We cancel it if the other events come in.

01:23:38
<transcript>: Let's see how they're doing this so sin timer after 1 second they have a delay.

01:23:45
<transcript>: And then they cancel the timer by passing the ID here and then.

01:23:45
<transcript>: down here

01:23:47
<transcript>: Down here, let's see.

01:23:51
<transcript>: Entries in timer after 1 second so when it becomes inactive.

01:23:56
<transcript>: In 1 second, we send a timer event and we go to active.

01:23:56
<transcript>: but if

01:23:58
<transcript>: But if we cancel.

01:23:58
<transcript>: cancel

01:24:00
<transcript>: Cancel timer.

01:24:04
<transcript>: My brain can only hold so much.

01:24:04
<transcript>: it's trying

01:24:07
<transcript>: It's trying, it's trying to hold all this.

01:24:10
<transcript>: I'm gonna take quick break.

01:24:10
<transcript>: and

01:24:14
<transcript>: And fill my water etc. Get a lot of bar.

01:24:14
<transcript>: i'll be our

01:24:20
<transcript>: I'll be our back. Maybe this XA stuff just needs a little time to Bake in my brain while I take this quick break.

01:24:56
thdxr: so how's everyone doing

01:24:57
sockthedev: why has david k piano not joined stream yet

01:25:22
stroopwafel26: @thdxr awesome, because it's friday

01:25:41
thdxr: @sockthedev he's still learning xstate

01:26:28
sockthedev: I've @'ed davidk on twitter. Will be legend if he joins prior to Adams return

01:26:52
sockthedev: would be legend to see an assist from the master himself

01:26:55
davidkpiano: Shhh pretend I'm not here

01:27:01
thdxr: omg

01:27:05
stroopwafel26: omg

01:27:06
sockthedev: boom!!

01:27:11
stroopwafel26: sock made it happen

01:27:28
sockthedev: ya'll. i deserve another twitter follow for this

01:27:41
thdxr: i got u

01:28:19
sockthedev: i wanna delete chat above now

01:28:27
thdxr: lol

01:33:10
thdxr: I'm getting a puppy on sunday

01:33:22
thdxr: he's gonna be the serverless mascot

01:33:34
sockthedev: cats can't be stoked

01:33:49
thdxr: lol

01:33:53
thdxr: yeah we'll see how that goes

01:34:11
stroopwafel26: what breed?

01:34:39
davidkpiano: Unfortunately I have to dip out for an hour or so, tell Adam I said hi

01:34:48
thdxr: @stroopwafel26 Doberman

01:35:01
sockthedev: ah, pity, thanks for popping in dude. still made my day

01:35:09
thdxr: this is him on the right: https://www.instagram.com/p/Ci_QgWurP-D/

01:35:11
thdxr: the dog not the child

01:35:57
thdxr: adam about to find out he took a break at the worst time

01:36:20
<transcript>: And say Hi, Hey, David. I'm thinking I'm too late, but Hello, and goodbye.

01:36:30
<transcript>: I'm reading chat. I can't not reach that.

01:36:40
<transcript>: You added David on Twitter.

01:36:40
<transcript>: that's funny

01:36:41
<transcript>: That's funny.

01:36:51
<transcript>: Sock. I will definitely follow you on Twitter. Did I? Did I not follow you the first time. Sock the Div.

01:36:51
<transcript>: it

01:36:53
<transcript>: It is.

01:36:53
<transcript>: everybody follows some

01:36:55
<transcript>: Everybody follows some sock.

01:36:55
<transcript>: there we go

01:36:59
thdxr: big day for sock

01:37:00
<transcript>: There we go. I know, I've seen your sock face somewhere.

01:37:03
<transcript>: Thank you for bringing David in.

01:37:03
<transcript>: you're getting

01:37:06
<transcript>: You're getting a puppy? Dax.

01:37:06
<transcript>: doing a puppy

01:37:10
<transcript>: Doing a puppy. The serverless mascot. That is awesome.

01:37:15
stroopwafel26: "I've seen your sock face" - Adam, 2022

01:37:18
<transcript>: Adoberman puppy.

01:37:18
<transcript>: oh there's pictures

01:37:22
<transcript>: Oh, there's pictures. Okay, I have to see the pictures.

01:37:29
<transcript>: Yeah. No. David came last time I played with X state.

01:37:34
<transcript>: Because.

01:37:36
<transcript>: See here. We.

01:37:38
<transcript>: 're on the left? What'd you say.

01:37:44
<transcript>: And to find out he took a break. No dog, not the child. This is him.

01:37:48
<transcript>: So that's the puppy. That's a big dog already. That's a big puppy.

01:37:52
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow Dio.

01:37:53
thdxr: 4 months

01:37:53
<transcript>: diox taking a

01:37:53
<transcript>: diox taking a break

01:37:55
<transcript>: Diox taking a break.

01:37:57
<transcript>: Alright.

01:38:02
<transcript>: Okay toggle machine. So let's see.

01:38:06
<transcript>: These are the delayed events.

01:38:06
<transcript>: so

01:38:10
<transcript>: So I guess I need to decide if I'm doing this on the server.

01:38:12
<transcript>: I'm doing this on.

01:38:12
<transcript>: the front end

01:38:13
<transcript>: The front end.

01:38:26
<transcript>: That's a four month old puppy, DAX. That's a big puppet.

01:38:47
<transcript>: I mean, I guess it would make sense to have the state machine on the server.

01:38:50
<transcript>: Have you done that before? Dax.

01:38:55
<transcript>: Have you done X state on the server and singing with the client.

01:38:58
sockthedev: ü•∞

01:39:05
thdxr: we use xstate in the SST CLI and sync the context over to the webapp

01:39:16
thdxr: but the cli is long lived, not sure if your setup is going to run in a lambda

01:39:20
popcorntoohot: does xstate on server work well with next.js?

01:39:32
<transcript>: Use exit necessary. Ssd. Cli.

01:39:44
<transcript>: Verselle so.

01:39:50
<transcript>: All the service eye stuff runs in a Lambda.

01:40:05
<transcript>: I think I'm just gonna do a on the front end.

01:40:07
thdxr: yeah then xstate on server probably won't work well

01:40:08
<transcript>: I just need to answer that question.

01:40:08
<transcript>: i'm gonna do on the front

01:40:10
<transcript>: I'm gonna do on the front end.

01:40:10
<transcript>: so

01:40:13
<transcript>: So this is just gonna replace all of our gnarly.

01:40:13
<transcript>: react

01:40:15
<transcript>: React State management.

01:40:18
<transcript>: Okay. So.

01:40:18
<transcript>: maybe

01:40:21
<transcript>: Maybe I need to think about my actions.

01:40:21
<transcript>: we

01:40:23
<transcript>: We think about.

01:40:23
<transcript>: the event

01:40:26
<transcript>: The events and the actions. Maybe that'll help.

01:40:31
<transcript>: So events.

01:40:40
<transcript>: Let's see. We just need to kind of list them, I guess.

01:40:45
<transcript>: We have a start game.

01:40:46
rickrickyy: Whaaat I got a sub

01:40:47
<transcript>: Then.

01:41:02
<transcript>: We have a.

01:41:05
<transcript>: I guess we'll just call it start.

01:41:10
<transcript>: Event that's when you start the new game, right.

01:41:23
<transcript>: Start.

01:41:23
<transcript>: and then

01:41:26
<transcript>: And then you can answer. There's an answer of it.

01:41:29
<transcript>: Is that an action.

01:41:29
<transcript>: i think i'm

01:41:31
<transcript>: I think I'm a little confused.

01:41:35
<transcript>: There's the actions user takes.

01:41:35
<transcript>: like

01:41:39
<transcript>: Like new game button Answer button.

01:41:45
<transcript>: Those also trigger events.

01:41:59
<transcript>: Those are the two actions. Right.

01:42:12
<transcript>: But there's more events.

01:42:22
<transcript>: Like the expiration.

01:42:28
thdxr: you mainly need states + events. You emit events from the UI and the state machine reacts (actions are side-effects from transitions)

01:42:36
<transcript>: And I guess is in an event when the result comes back.

01:42:43
<transcript>: Is that separate events.

01:42:47
<transcript>: Yeah. I think separate events. So like.

01:42:50
<transcript>: Our guest do we need to have a correct image.

01:42:50
<transcript>: state maybe

01:42:53
<transcript>: State maybe we just have a.

01:42:56
<transcript>: One final state, that's like.

01:43:05
<transcript>: After You Answer You Click Answer You Click On button.

01:43:08
<transcript>: The game is going to come back with a response.

01:43:18
<transcript>: So like, what is what I'm gonna call that state? And we'll just have, like, a property that is, like, correct or incorrect or expired or whatever on the context. Right.

01:43:29
<transcript>: Mainly needs States and events. You emit events from the UI.

01:43:29
<transcript>: and the state machine

01:43:33
<transcript>: And the state machine reacts. Actions are side effects from transitions. Okay.

01:43:33
<transcript>: so don't think about

01:43:35
<transcript>: So don't think about actions.

01:43:47
<transcript>: Responded, Like, what is this event.

01:44:00
<transcript>: Are you guessed.

01:44:03
<transcript>: Maybe I should think of like that. You guess.

01:44:03
<transcript>: and you get

01:44:07
<transcript>: And you get a response to that. Guess what would that event be called.

01:44:10
<transcript>: True's opinions.

01:44:18
<transcript>: It's like.

01:44:18
<transcript>: a

01:44:22
thdxr: events probably don't go back to the ui

01:44:25
<transcript>: A. It's like you're asking a question you ask and they answer the server answers right.

01:44:30
<transcript>: Events probably don't go back to the UI.

01:44:34
<transcript>: Oh, I see.

01:44:38
<transcript>: So events are only thing that I emit.

01:44:38
<transcript>: myself

01:44:47
<transcript>: Myself. I guess my question is like hashtag. I think about the state machine in the context of asynchronous API calls. So I have.

01:44:54
<transcript>: I'm in an active state. That's where the timer is going. Things are active. You're you're presented with a question.

01:44:57
<transcript>: Or with a Trivia round.

01:45:01
<transcript>: When you click a button.

01:45:13
<transcript>: To guess one of the services we've fire off. I get that moment. We've transitioned into a different state, a pending state where we don't. We don't know if you were right or wrong yet. And we're waiting on the server.

01:45:18
<transcript>: And then the server comes back with a response. So you're saying that's not an event.

01:45:28
<transcript>: That you're saying, DAX.

01:45:28
<transcript>: you

01:45:33
<transcript>: You were procrastinating. Now I've officially put you to work next. You're explaining X state to me.

01:45:34
mightycore1: I would model this with ivokations: https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/communication.html#the-invoke-property

01:45:40
thdxr: 1. state = WAITING 2. emit GUESS event 3. if guess is wrong, state = WAITING and can update the context with info about the last guess being wrong 4. If guess is right state can transition into DONE or something

01:45:42
mightycore1: *invokations

01:45:47
<transcript>: Lots of information. I would model this with.

01:45:47
<transcript>: ivoc

01:45:49
<transcript>: Ivocations.

01:45:53
<transcript>: Copy a link. Bring that over here.

01:45:59
<transcript>: Hey, DAX, State waiting.

01:46:04
<transcript>: To Emit Guest Event Three if guess is wrong.

01:46:10
<transcript>: Stayed is waiting and can update the contacts with info about the last guest being wrong.

01:46:15
<transcript>: If guess is right sick can transition into done or something. Okay.

01:46:19
<transcript>: So I think whether it's right or wrong, it always transitions into.

01:46:21
<transcript>: The same state.

01:46:21
<transcript>: like

01:46:24
<transcript>: Like the behavior at least in the game is the same.

01:46:24
<transcript>: if you're

01:46:28
<transcript>: If you're right or wrong, we show the right or wrong answer.

01:46:28
<transcript>: for like two seconds

01:46:31
<transcript>: For like 2 seconds, and then we switch over to a new round.

01:46:37
<transcript>: The invoke property.

01:46:44
<transcript>: An invocation is defined in a state's node configuration with the invoke property, whose value is an object that contains source.

01:46:51
<transcript>: Okay.

01:46:51
<transcript>: okay

01:46:52
<transcript>: Okay.

01:46:59
<transcript>: So this is.

01:47:02
<transcript>: A way to model these like.

01:47:12
<transcript>: So Loading.

01:47:15
<transcript>: When you invoke the Loading.

01:47:20
<transcript>: Okay. Okay.

01:47:22
<transcript>: So based on.

01:47:27
<transcript>: Actions assign.

01:47:35
<transcript>: Is just changing the state, right.

01:47:37
<transcript>: Is that what I'm gathering.

01:47:46
<transcript>: Okay.

01:47:47
bausmeier: yes, changing context

01:47:49
<transcript>: So then I.

01:47:51
mightycore1: yeah, you can set the state inside the instance

01:47:58
bausmeier: context is like mutable state

01:48:00
<transcript>: Set the state inside the instance. Okay.

01:48:02
<transcript>: Okay.

01:48:05
<transcript>: I like this.

01:48:16
<transcript>: Sources search.

01:48:16
<transcript>: so

01:48:21
<transcript>: So here's our promise. This is what returns. Okay.

01:48:21
<transcript>: okay

01:48:22
<transcript>: Okay.

01:48:37
<transcript>: I think this makes sense.

01:48:45
<transcript>: Yeah. So the context.

01:48:46
thdxr: you can also have a WRONG_ANSWER state if you want to show it for a bite before allowing them to guess again

01:48:48
<transcript>: Our context is going to have something like.

01:48:54
<transcript>: The guess.

01:48:58
<transcript>: Like the choice, I think, is what I call it.

01:49:06
<transcript>: That's not how you model context, is it? This would be like.

01:49:10
<transcript>: The initial value.

01:49:14
<transcript>: Choice.

01:49:16
<transcript>: As a result.

01:49:20
<transcript>: Current round.

01:49:27
<transcript>: I like this. Right? This is what our context looks like. It's all the used States that we were using, right.

01:49:38
<transcript>: So a guess event you can also have a wrong answer state if you want to show it for a bit before allowing them to guess again. That's the thing I think.

01:49:46
<transcript>: I think once the response comes back, the behavior in the game is the same no matter whether it's right or wrong.

01:49:52
<transcript>: We show we just show for like 2 seconds the correct answer.

01:50:00
<transcript>: And maybe you got the correct answer. Maybe you got the wrong answer. But we show the correct answer. And then we move to a new round and tell the server says, like.

01:50:00
<transcript>: you're done

01:50:02
<transcript>: You're done.

01:50:02
<transcript>: that was

01:50:04
<transcript>: That was the last round.

01:50:09
<transcript>: Right.

01:50:15
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:50:21
<transcript>: Okay, let's start. I'm gonna start doing it in react. Now.

01:50:25
<transcript>: I feel like I've.

01:50:36
<transcript>: Well, I guess we can at least get our States right. So I think there's just a final. I don't like calling it final. We're gonna call something else. I think there's just a state.

01:50:39
<transcript>: After.

01:50:43
thdxr: ROUND_OVER

01:50:44
<transcript>: So we go answer on guests.

01:50:44
<transcript>: we go

01:50:46
<transcript>: We go to pending.

01:50:50
<transcript>: Start. We go to active.

01:50:55
<transcript>: And then pending.

01:50:57
<transcript>: On response.

01:51:00
<transcript>: To go to final.

01:51:00
<transcript>: this map

01:51:01
<transcript>: This map.

01:51:01
<transcript>: kind of my different

01:51:03
<transcript>: Kind of my different States.

01:51:07
<transcript>: And then finally.

01:51:07
<transcript>: is

01:51:09
<transcript>: Is a conditional.

01:51:11
<transcript>: Pending.

01:51:26
<transcript>: So this is where we have our response now from the server. So the invoke on pending.

01:51:30
bausmeier: You can have nested states as well. If you want to have different behaviour within that state where the response has come back.

01:51:31
<transcript>: If we're using this invoke model.

01:51:31
<transcript>: we

01:51:33
<transcript>: We'd have something like this.

01:51:43
<transcript>: How's this work.

01:51:43
<transcript>: pending

01:51:44
<transcript>: Pending.

01:51:52
<transcript>: Can we take in.

01:51:55
<transcript>: So context and event. Can they take in a query? Okay.

01:51:59
<transcript>: So the event can have some like.

01:51:59
<transcript>: args

01:52:01
<transcript>: Args on it basically.

01:52:03
<transcript>: Okay.

01:52:08
<transcript>: I think I want to start trying to do this.

01:52:11
<transcript>: I'm gonna put that in there.

01:52:11
<transcript>: i think i'll start

01:52:14
<transcript>: I think I'll start trying to do this in react.

01:52:22
<transcript>: I may regret that choice.

01:52:29
<transcript>: Round over that should be a state.

01:52:33
<transcript>: Yeah, I guess so, because the game's not complete. Just the round is complete.

01:52:37
<transcript>: completes

01:52:37
<transcript>: completes as well

01:52:41
<transcript>: Completes as well. If you want to have a different behavior within that state where the response has come back.

01:52:52
<transcript>: Okay.

01:52:57
bausmeier: A nice thing about xstate is that you can get the whole thing working before even integrating with React. I'd start with that.

01:52:57
<transcript>: So much to learn, Crystal. Thank you for the follow.

01:52:59
thdxr: those groans don't sound good

01:53:02
<transcript>: So I don't think I like that I can have nested States because now my brain hurts.

01:53:15
<transcript>: The nice thing about X Eight is that you can get the whole thing working before even integrating with React. I'd start with that. Okay. I guess like, maybe I'm not understanding what this visualizer is capable of.

01:53:23
<transcript>: I may not understand what it's capable of. Let me just keep going on it.

01:53:27
<transcript>: Responds, let's try and get the invoke thing.

01:53:31
<transcript>: Right after I did that, I'm gonna pull it back over here.

01:53:35
<transcript>: Let's try to get this working.

01:53:36
<transcript>: So.

01:53:40
<transcript>: My head's in the way of this, isn't it.

01:53:43
<transcript>: Here we go.

01:53:49
<transcript>: Okay.

01:53:57
zerkbtw: what is xtate?

01:54:00
<transcript>: Idle on start goes to active on guests. It goes to pending. Pending is gonna be an invoke. This is where we're gonna make our like network request, right.

01:54:05
<transcript>: Like this.

01:54:07
<transcript>: Okay.

01:54:12
<transcript>: So.

01:54:12
<transcript>: anti

01:54:13
<transcript>: Anti.

01:54:13
<transcript>: antique

01:54:14
<transcript>: Antique.

01:54:16
thdxr: is this bg music licensed

01:54:17
<transcript>: On error.

01:54:23
<transcript>: I don't even know what to think about errors. I guess that could happen.

01:54:28
<transcript>: But on done, there's gonna be multiple possibilities here. Right.

01:54:32
<transcript>: So.

01:54:39
<transcript>: Undone. We're gonna target complete.

01:54:39
<transcript>: but

01:54:42
<transcript>: But we're gonna set state.

01:54:43
<transcript>: based

01:54:46
<transcript>: Based on let's see assign result.

01:54:54
<transcript>: Data. I think it's just the event. Well, I don't know what is event.

01:55:01
<transcript>: Will be omitted up here by our this thing right.

01:55:04
<transcript>: So this is our.

01:55:04
<transcript>: let's see

01:55:05
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:55:13
<transcript>: Search new promise resolvers this is where it feels like, can I do this stuff in the visualizer? I don't know. Is this stuff I can visualize.

01:55:20
<transcript>: What is? Xta Zerk? Welcome to Chat. Zirk.

01:55:24
<transcript>: Xate is a state machine library.

01:55:32
<transcript>: And I'm trying to use it to make my state management easier. Or more like.

01:55:32
<transcript>: grocable

01:55:34
<transcript>: Grocable in my react app.

01:55:38
<transcript>: Is this background music license DAX.

01:55:40
<transcript>: No.

01:55:40
<transcript>: it

01:55:42
<transcript>: It's not.

01:55:45
<transcript>: But it's not in the VOD either. So.

01:55:46
bausmeier: Yeah you can use promises there.

01:55:47
thdxr: calling police

01:55:49
<transcript>: Don't ask, don't tell or something I don't know.

01:55:55
<transcript>: You can use promises there so here.

01:56:00
<transcript>: If event dot query.

01:56:00
<transcript>: what

01:56:02
<transcript>: What is the event.

01:56:05
<transcript>: Like what is the.

01:56:10
<transcript>: What is the event.

01:56:16
<transcript>: I guess for pending it would be the guess event. So the guest event would have some data on it.

01:56:16
<transcript>: and that's

01:56:18
<transcript>: And that's what this is.

01:56:18
<transcript>: here

01:56:21
<transcript>: Here. So event dot.

01:56:26
<transcript>: Twice links. No choice specified.

01:56:27
<transcript>: Right.

01:56:33
<transcript>: Else we resolve get.

01:56:37
<transcript>: Result.

01:56:39
<transcript>: Vent choice.

01:56:44
<transcript>: Okay.

01:56:45
<transcript>: Is this gonna work.

01:56:49
<transcript>: Unexpected if our source.

01:56:56
<transcript>: So is my invoke not working here? Can I not visualize this.

01:57:02
<transcript>: Anyone know if you can visualize.

01:57:02
<transcript>: the inv

01:57:04
<transcript>: The invoke stuff.

01:57:19
<transcript>: To the parent machine can be modeled via callback handler, which is a function that takes in two arguments. Callback.

01:57:19
<transcript>: on receipt

01:57:20
<transcript>: On receipt.

01:57:32
sockthedev: Twitch recommendations broke. Literally only following devs.   Recommend be like: - Counter-Strike - Overwatch 2 - Dota 2 - ....

01:57:33
<transcript>: So.

01:57:41
<transcript>: Like, I know XA can do all the things I need. Like, there's a beautiful state machine.

01:57:45
<transcript>: In theory that wraps up this whole game.

01:57:45
<transcript>: nicely

01:57:47
<transcript>: Nicely in a bow.

01:57:47
<transcript>: and

01:57:50
<transcript>: And it's just trying to find.

01:57:50
<transcript>: trying to

01:57:52
<transcript>: Trying to find it, you know.

01:57:54
<transcript>: Snotty.

01:58:06
<transcript>: Twitter recommendations broke literally only following Des recommendations counterstrike Overwatch suit Dota do.

01:58:11
<transcript>: dot

01:58:11
sockthedev: Yeah, we would have had it if you didn't go for a break :(

01:58:12
<transcript>: Dot.

01:58:20
<transcript>: Parent events.

01:58:28
<transcript>: Whenever parents sends Ping.

01:58:31
<transcript>: Send parent pong event.

01:58:48
oetziofficial: @sockthedev well, its a primarily game streaming platform :D

01:58:51
<transcript>: Okay. My brain hurts. I'm not. I'm not backing away from X Eight. We are committed.

01:58:53
<transcript>: We are committed.

01:59:00
<transcript>: If I didn't go for a break, I think David would have just whipped it up real quick.

01:59:08
oetziofficial: also Hi :D

01:59:16
thdxr: `pnpm remove xstate`

01:59:22
<transcript>: Compound States.

01:59:22
<transcript>: so it's

01:59:24
<transcript>: So it's what you meant by Child States.

01:59:34
<transcript>: Hey, let's see.

01:59:34
sockthedev: Looking forward to my new keyboard

01:59:38
<transcript>: I'm pushing forward.

01:59:38
<transcript>: looking forward

01:59:39
<transcript>: Looking forward.

01:59:49
<transcript>: You guys are funny. No, I'm not. I'm using X eight. I'm convinced. I just need to learn X state because I think this game state is gonna get too gnarly.

01:59:49
<transcript>: if i

01:59:54
<transcript>: If I try and do it by hand I'm not convinced we'll get very far today.

01:59:56
<transcript>: But there's always next week.

02:00:07
<transcript>: Planning State Charts One of the benefits they charts is that in the process of putting a SAR together, you explore all the possible States in your process. This exploration will help you avoid bugs and errors in your code.

02:00:23
<transcript>: Okay.

02:00:23
<transcript>: so

02:00:26
<transcript>: So is there a new round event.

02:00:29
<transcript>: Around started event.

02:00:36
<transcript>: No, it's an invoke.

02:00:36
<transcript>: so

02:00:39
<transcript>: So when we go from idol to active.

02:00:43
<transcript>: We need to invoke here. I need a better understand invoke.

02:00:46
<transcript>: I think I think this is a big part of.

02:00:57
<transcript>: Expressing the entire apps behavior in a single machine can quickly become complex and unwieldy. It's natural and encouraged to use multiple machines that communicate with each other to express conflict.

02:01:05
<transcript>: This is a different invoke, isn't it.

02:01:12
<transcript>: An invocation is defined in a state's node state nodes configuration with the invoke property.

02:01:12
<transcript>: whose value

02:01:23
<transcript>: Whose value is an object that contains source, the sources of service to invoke, which can be a machine, a function that returns a promise, a function over to the callback handler, flexor versions and observable a string.

02:01:29
<transcript>: An invoke source object, which contains the source string. In. Type. Source.

02:01:33
<transcript>: Okay.

02:01:34
thdxr: it took me a bit to understand invoke with xstate, I just did everything without it then refactored it once I understood the basics

02:01:40
<transcript>: So that source, in this case, is a function that returns a promise, right? Yeah.

02:01:44
<transcript>: Has an idea.

02:01:54
<transcript>: On done the transition to be taken when the child machine reaches its final state, or the invoked promise resolved, or they invoked observable completes.

02:01:54
<transcript>: on error

02:01:55
<transcript>: On error.

02:01:55
<transcript>: okay

02:02:00
<transcript>: Okay auto forward if all events since this machine should be sent.

02:02:00
<transcript>: or forward

02:02:02
<transcript>: Or forward to the invoke child.

02:02:05
<transcript>: Okay. And then data.

02:02:12
<transcript>: Only use one invoking machine so we're not invoking machine.

02:02:12
<transcript>: we're just calling

02:02:14
<transcript>: We're just calling up a promise.

02:02:27
<transcript>: Don't get the on property on the state confused with invoke undone. They're similar transitions, but refer to different things on dent property on a state node versus compound state node reaching a final state.

02:02:34
<transcript>: The invoke got undone property. Reverse to the invocation. Okay the source being done right.

02:02:36
<transcript>: Different things, got it.

02:02:40
<transcript>: Got it.

02:02:44
<transcript>: Okay.

02:02:48
<transcript>: So, yeah, this is a state, and it can have child States.

02:02:48
<transcript>: is what i

02:02:50
<transcript>: Is what I'm gathering.

02:02:54
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow Bin yarb.

02:03:01
<transcript>: It took me a bit to understand invoke with X state. I just did everything without it, then refactor it. Once I understood the basics.

02:03:11
<transcript>: Oh, that sounds like a good idea. Sounds very sensible tox like do all your asynchronous calls and stuff out of extate and just emotion.

02:03:15
<transcript>: Into your statement.

02:03:19
<transcript>: I thought I could just understand it really quickly, you know.

02:03:26
<transcript>: Since every promise can be modeled to the state machine, X state can enable promises as is.

02:03:29
<transcript>: Project.

02:03:36
<transcript>: If the state where the invoke promises active.

02:03:36
<transcript>: is acted before

02:03:40
laytanl_: Hello mom?!

02:03:40
<transcript>: Is acted before the promise settles the result that promises discarded.

02:03:47
laytanl_: Adam's mom*

02:03:48
<transcript>: Okay.

02:03:48
<transcript>: so we're fetching

02:03:51
<transcript>: So we're fetching a user context user ID.

02:03:57
<transcript>: But it can also be based on the event that brought us into this right.

02:04:01
<transcript>: So in this case the fetch event.

02:04:08
<transcript>: Goes into Loading that event that you emitted. Do they show this the fetch of itch event? No.

02:04:13
<transcript>: Okay.

02:04:18
<transcript>: But it makes sense that there'd be a guest event.

02:04:18
<transcript>: and that guess

02:04:21
<transcript>: And that guess would have like.

02:04:28
<transcript>: A guess on it, right. Like AWS, Dynamo.

02:04:28
<transcript>: db

02:04:31
<transcript>: Db or something. Right.

02:04:35
<transcript>: That guess if it would have a payload.

02:04:35
<transcript>: or something like that

02:04:37
<transcript>: Or something like that.

02:04:41
<transcript>: And this pending state.

02:04:41
<transcript>: could

02:04:42
<transcript>: Could.

02:04:45
<transcript>: Invoke this answer thing.

02:04:45
<transcript>: with

02:04:46
<transcript>: With that event.

02:04:51
<transcript>: Having that data on it, right. A choice is what it was.

02:04:57
<transcript>: All right.

02:05:02
<transcript>: And then on done.

02:05:02
<transcript>: we go

02:05:07
<transcript>: We go to complete there should be round complete or.

02:05:26
<transcript>: I don't know if my mom's here.

02:05:31
thdxr: it's me, I'm adam's mom

02:05:41
thdxr: he wet the bed until he was 19

02:05:46
<transcript>: I feel like if I were doing it in React now, I would I would be able to see stuff happen. But you guys are saying I can model the whole thing here. Can I really though, like when there's promises involved.

02:05:53
<transcript>: How far can I get? I could try them all of the delayed stuff so on complete.

02:05:58
<transcript>: If you're a final state, does that mean you can't go back to the beginning.

02:06:02
<transcript>: Like.

02:06:02
<transcript>: final

02:06:04
<transcript>: Final States.

02:06:09
<transcript>: Final state the found state indicates that it's parents state is done.

02:06:19
<transcript>: Go to green.

02:06:27
<transcript>: Okay. So when it hits the final state, it'll go to the ondone.

02:06:30
<transcript>: So what I'm seeing.

02:06:35
<transcript>: This stuff is so so hard for me to Grock.

02:06:43
<transcript>: In a compound state, reaching a final child state node will internally raise a done of it for the compound state node.

02:06:48
<transcript>: So I can say.

02:06:52
<transcript>: Outside of the state I can say on done here.

02:06:55
<transcript>: No, I don't want to do that.

02:06:55
<transcript>: now

02:07:02
<transcript>: Now, because this I'm trying to wrap like even before you started a game here, like Idle is like you haven't started a game.

02:07:08
<transcript>: So maybe I should have like all the rest of it happening within.

02:07:08
<transcript>: as

02:07:09
<transcript>: As a child.

02:07:13
<transcript>: A set of Child States under active.

02:07:14
noob_cod3r: what is this?

02:07:16
<transcript>: And that and then it goes.

02:07:22
<transcript>: I don't know.

02:07:22
<transcript>: what

02:07:24
<transcript>: What is this? Noob, I don't know.

02:07:30
<transcript>: What is this? What is this, anyway.

02:07:45
<transcript>: I really want to make progress on AW, guess, but we reached that point with the state management where it was like, this is too complicated.

02:07:45
<transcript>: we should use

02:07:46
<transcript>: We should use a state machine.

02:07:53
<transcript>: Then we use a safe machine. And we're saying, this is too complicated. We shouldn't use a state machine.

02:07:55
bausmeier: Have to go feed my hangry toddler. Hope you figure this stuff out.

02:08:03
<transcript>: I will figure it out. Bous. Enjoy.

02:08:03
<transcript>: i'll be

02:08:05
thdxr: if I'm being honest I spent a bunch of time learning xstate for a complex situation in the SST CLI and then I never have used it since and am afraid to touch that code

02:08:07
<transcript>: I'll be feeding my hangry toddler here in about 45 minutes.

02:08:11
laytanl_: Is this the point where you throw out xstate again LUL

02:08:25
<transcript>: From being honest, it's been a bunch of time learning expert for complex situations, CLI, and then I never have used it since. Yeah, I could see that. Like I build this complicated state machine. It works, but I don't know how to change it.

02:08:28
<transcript>: No. Latent. It's not.

02:08:28
<transcript>: i'm not

02:08:32
<transcript>: I'm not throwing it out. I'm just stretching.

02:08:36
<transcript>: We're just stretching and talking.

02:08:36
<transcript>: i'm open

02:08:38
<transcript>: I'm open to all possibilities.

02:08:41
<transcript>: But I'm not throwing it out just yet.

02:08:46
popcorntoohot: I stepped away for a bit

02:08:52
popcorntoohot: it seemed simple when i left

02:08:52
<transcript>: You didn't miss much popcorn.

02:08:52
<transcript>: just like

02:08:55
<transcript>: Just like Grappling with X eight.

02:08:55
<transcript>: it seems simple

02:08:56
popcorntoohot: what happened

02:09:03
<transcript>: It seems simple. Oh, well, maybe popcorn. Maybe you can help push me over the edge. What happened? Oh, I'm. Nothing happened. I didn't throw at X Eight. We're just talking.

02:09:07
<transcript>: I just needed a minute to just talk.

02:09:12
<transcript>: It's Friday, Friday.

02:09:16
<transcript>: What is a good goal? What can I get done in 45 minutes.

02:09:23
<transcript>: Can I figure out state machines in 45 minutes? There's definitely some simple parts of this whole thing.

02:09:23
<transcript>: i think

02:09:25
thdxr: you can remove xstate within 45min

02:09:28
<transcript>: I think I get so overwhelmed when there's so many options.

02:09:34
laytanl_: LOL

02:09:35
<transcript>: Stop. We're not removing it.

02:09:45
popcorntoohot: Nah idk xstate I prolly missed some big timer stuff

02:09:47
<transcript>: I think like, I would rather not be the option of child States or multiple machines, because then I know it's like, more flexible, but then it's like, Well, Geez, I could do this so many different ways.

02:09:52
<transcript>: Some big timer, stuff.

02:09:54
thdxr: you can model everything as a single machine with a flat set of states

02:10:06
<transcript>: I don't think I worked on the timer at all. I think we're just trying to figure out what States do we have. You can model everything as a single machine with a flat set of States. Maybe that's what we should do if we stick to that as a constraint. I need some constraints, you know.

02:10:06
<transcript>: i need

02:10:07
thdxr: I never really used child states, I did graduate to multiple machines at some point

02:10:14
<transcript>: I need like, there's only one way you can do this. Do it this way. I never really use child States. I did graduate to multiple machines at some point.

02:10:14
<transcript>: i'm not there

02:10:17
<transcript>: I'm not there mentally, emotionally.

02:10:17
<transcript>: physically

02:10:19
niftynate80: State

02:10:22
<transcript>: Physically I'm just not there maybe someday maybe someday.

02:10:26
<transcript>: State Nifty Nate.

02:10:28
<transcript>: State.

02:10:28
<transcript>: okay

02:10:33
<transcript>: Okay. So if we just do flat set of States, one machine.

02:10:33
<transcript>: then

02:10:38
popcorntoohot: I think flat state will keep the state simpler

02:10:42
thdxr: has anyone built a framework that removes state?

02:10:42
<transcript>: Then how do we feel about these States? Idle that's before you start the game, you start the game. Now you're in an active game. It's really that you start around.

02:10:49
thdxr: seems annoying

02:10:49
<transcript>: Like when you start the game, you get an initial round. You are now in an active round.

02:10:49
<transcript>: you can then

02:10:50
noob_cod3r: what is the beta key in publicdev

02:10:52
<transcript>: You can then answer or it can expire.

02:10:58
<transcript>: I agree. Dax. Who needs state.

02:10:58
<transcript>: yeah we're

02:11:02
<transcript>: Yeah, we're gonna stick with Flat. We're gonna flatten the state.

02:11:04
adamdotdev: !betakey

02:11:04
fossabot: Use beta key `adamisontwitch2` after signing up at public.dev.

02:11:06
<transcript>: Noob coder you can use.

02:11:06
<transcript>: man

02:11:09
<transcript>: Man. I also have decisions to make about public Dev.

02:11:12
<transcript>: There's just a lot in my brain right now.

02:11:25
<transcript>: Good music, though.

02:11:25
<transcript>: the music's helping

02:11:27
<transcript>: The music's helping.

02:11:33
<transcript>: I think I need to look at less docs.

02:11:35
<transcript>: What are effects.

02:11:40
popcorntoohot: You might want a transition from correct/incorrect to end of active  and a transition from correct/incorrect to end of game

02:11:43
<transcript>: Executes the synchronous side effect with no events sent back to the state chart, or send an event synchronously back to the state chart.

02:11:59
<transcript>: This is what we were talking about, doing right invoke promises.

02:12:08
<transcript>: So if we're active and we do a guess.

02:12:08
<transcript>: we go into pending

02:12:09
<transcript>: We go into pending.

02:12:13
<transcript>: And we invoke the answer function.

02:12:13
<transcript>: which

02:12:24
<transcript>: Which is going to do the mutation thing. The problem is like this machine. When we do create machine, in reality, it's gonna be outside of our component. Right? So I won't have access to hooks.

02:12:29
<transcript>: Like, I won't have access to the mutations. And TRPC. Is that right.

02:12:32
<transcript>: You might want to transition from correct. Incorrect.

02:12:32
<transcript>: to end of

02:12:37
<transcript>: To end of active and a transition from correct incorrect to end of game.

02:12:37
<transcript>: that's

02:12:40
<transcript>: That's true. So there's a different.

02:12:47
<transcript>: But there's another round.

02:12:50
thdxr: there's a way to pass in stuff when booting up the machine if you need stuff from react context

02:12:55
<transcript>: And you completed the round and that was the last round. We haven't even defined a last round yet on the server, but we will have some limit.

02:12:57
<transcript>: I.

02:13:02
<transcript>: 'm Booting up the machine if you need stuff from React context. Okay.

02:13:05
<transcript>: Okay.

02:13:05
<transcript>: so

02:13:09
<transcript>: So I could pass in my mutations, my TrpC stuff.

02:13:15
thdxr: that's why the visualizer works, you can basically set placeholders for everything and pass in the real functions in react code

02:13:15
<transcript>: Okay.

02:13:20
<transcript>: So theoretically.

02:13:23
<transcript>: Our context could hold those mutations.

02:13:29
<transcript>: Swap the visualizer works. You can basically set placeholders for everything and pass them the real functions and react code.

02:13:32
<transcript>: Okay.

02:13:41
<transcript>: So this could just be a placeholder. This answer function doesn't need to do anything.

02:13:42
thdxr: but I also don't remember how to do that so GOOD LUCK

02:13:48
<transcript>: Like when I tried to save this. It didn't like it, right.

02:13:51
<transcript>: Let's try with source. I can't have this.

02:14:17
<transcript>: Console. Or there's a console Where's the console.

02:14:22
<transcript>: Anybody see a console.

02:14:26
<transcript>: Oh like the actual Dev tools.

02:14:44
<transcript>: I just don't like the front end. I've decided.

02:14:44
<transcript>: i don't

02:14:45
<transcript>: I don't like it.

02:14:45
<transcript>: i just don't

02:14:47
<transcript>: I just don't.

02:14:49
<transcript>: I like building front end stuff.

02:14:54
<transcript>: I don't like it.

02:14:58
<transcript>: I didn't see more details in the console. Did anyone see more details.

02:14:58
thdxr: let's build api only products

02:15:02
<transcript>: X oh I expect identifier source at new function.

02:15:04
<transcript>: So can I not do the invoke thing.

02:15:05
thdxr: awsguess as a service

02:15:09
<transcript>: Loading that's a state Loading invoke source.

02:15:11
<transcript>: What's the problem? Pinning.

02:15:11
<transcript>: states

02:15:15
<transcript>: States Pending invoke Source answer.

02:15:22
<transcript>: Oh, Build API only Products yes, please.

02:15:27
<transcript>: So, good luck, awesome.

02:15:31
<transcript>: Aw, guess as a service.

02:15:38
<transcript>: Oh, maybe we should this talk. Maybe I should just. It's Friday. This is the end of my day.

02:15:38
<transcript>: maybe we

02:15:40
<transcript>: Maybe we should just hang out.

02:15:40
<transcript>: is

02:15:44
<transcript>: Is are we gonna get any further anyone think we're getting any further on the state machine.

02:15:52
popcorntoohot: api only is so easy since its just stateless

02:15:54
thdxr: let's hang out

02:15:54
<transcript>: Like I feel like I should be doing this in the visualizer, but I also feel like I don't know how to make the visualization work now that we're into real stuff.

02:15:55
thdxr: it's friday

02:16:00
<transcript>: Let's hang out. It's Friday.

02:16:02
<transcript>: I agree.

02:16:09
<transcript>: Yeah, I've got to make a decision on public Goddev. I.

02:16:09
<transcript>: put

02:16:15
<transcript>: Put it on Micro acquire just because I'm tired of not, like, I'm trying to, like, make a bunch of money on it.

02:16:15
<transcript>: i just

02:16:21
<transcript>: I just. I'm tired of feeling guilty that I'm not giving it the attention it needs. There's a bunch of people using it.

02:16:21
<transcript>: there's like six hundred

02:16:23
<transcript>: There's like 600 signups in beta.

02:16:23
<transcript>: and

02:16:33
<transcript>: And I haven't let new people into the beta for some time because I was doing a redesign and I haven't worked on the redesign for a month.

02:16:43
<transcript>: But like, the redesigns, like, 90% done. So I need to, like, just get that done and get it into beta, and then just make the thing public. It shouldn't be in beta. That's dumb.

02:16:56
<transcript>: And all that stuff. I need to do that stuff. But it's not really my priority right now. And I feel guilty. And I hate feeling guilty about, like, a project not getting attention. So I thought maybe I could find somebody that would take it over. I could sell it. And.

02:16:59
ozdy: Bro you should be at least senior software engineer, maybe staff

02:17:00
<transcript>: They would take it over. It would get the attention it needs.

02:17:00
<transcript>: and

02:17:05
<transcript>: And I could feel good about it moving on and without me. Right.

02:17:07
popcorntoohot: public should be public

02:17:08
<transcript>: So someone wants to buy it.

02:17:12
<transcript>: And they're serious. They're very serious. They made an offer.

02:17:12
<transcript>: i'm happy with the

02:17:17
<transcript>: I'm happy with the offer. I'd be excited to, like.

02:17:17
<transcript>: see it

02:17:22
popcorntoohot: funny to think of that

02:17:29
<transcript>: See it live on and not feel guilty. The problem is it's gonna take quite a bit of my work just to do the transition, like just the whole transaction, like handing it to this person is gonna take.

02:17:29
<transcript>: quite a bit

02:17:32
darthtrooper14: Sorry I just arrive what is he buying?

02:17:36
<transcript>: Quite a bit of effort on my end, and then I started thinking, Well, if I'm gonna do that, if I'm gonna put in that effort.

02:17:36
<transcript>: why

02:17:41
<transcript>: Why not just finish what I've started and trying to get it out there and just.

02:17:41
<transcript>: have that

02:17:44
<transcript>: Have that control. I don't know.

02:17:44
<transcript>: i don't

02:17:46
<transcript>: I don't know what to do.

02:17:46
<transcript>: public should be

02:17:48
<transcript>: Public should be public? Yeah.

02:17:54
<transcript>: Ozd bro. You should be at least senior software engineer, maybe staff.

02:17:54
<transcript>: or is it the

02:17:58
goudri: why you are beautiful ?

02:17:59
<transcript>: Or is it the state chart stuff? Did you re impress with my usage of X state.

02:18:10
<transcript>: Welcome. Not. Welcome to Chat. Yeah, welcome to Chat. Darth. Dart. Trooper. Sorry, I just drive. What is he buying? I'm not buying anything.

02:18:10
<transcript>: i'm considering

02:18:12
<transcript>: I'm considering selling.

02:18:13
thdxr: ^ deep

02:18:14
<transcript>: Side project.

02:18:14
<transcript>: and i don't

02:18:16
<transcript>: And I don't know if I want to do it.

02:18:25
<transcript>: But welcome to Chat. Also, thank you for the follow Darth Trooper. I appreciate that. Why you are beautiful. You're talking to me.

02:18:25
<transcript>: sounding me

02:18:27
<transcript>: Sounding me this.

02:18:28
<transcript>: Deep.

02:18:38
<transcript>: The lodghd. Thank you for the follow. So, yeah, that's why the things I'm debating right now.

02:18:41
<transcript>: Trying to decide.

02:18:41
<transcript>: oh i've got

02:18:49
<transcript>: Oh, I've got another thing. I'm trying to decide while we're just talking. We're just talking for the rest of stream. We're just hanging out now. So if you don't like that kind of thing, that's cool.

02:18:49
<transcript>: we're not

02:18:53
<transcript>: We're not gonna be coding anymore. I'm just here for another, like, 20 minutes.

02:18:59
<transcript>: So there's a public on that stuff. I gotta figure out what I'm gonna do, and then there's also.

02:19:02
<transcript>: Like a hundred things around the house.

02:19:02
<transcript>: that we're trying

02:19:06
<transcript>: That we're trying to decide if we want to do I'm gonna put solar on my roof.

02:19:12
goudri: yes you are

02:19:13
<transcript>: And this solar company proposed this kind of crazy thing.

02:19:13
<transcript>: i could do

02:19:16
<transcript>: I could do on my roof.

02:19:23
<transcript>: And I got it aside. If I want to do that, it's like it's quite a solar system.

02:19:26
<transcript>: Are they called Solar systems? Every time I say that I think of like.

02:19:26
<transcript>: mercury

02:19:29
thdxr: does it make your roof ugly or is it built into the roofing tiles

02:19:30
<transcript>: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, that whole thing.

02:19:34
<transcript>: But it's a solar. It's a set of panels on my roof.

02:19:36
thdxr: I know you love aesthetics

02:19:38
glamshatterskull: solar array

02:19:39
<transcript>: And it doesn't make the roof look ugly, because no one can see it. Dax.

02:19:39
<transcript>: i

02:19:41
<transcript>: I do love aesthetics.

02:19:41
<transcript>: so

02:19:45
<transcript>: So Glam Shatterskull welcome to chat.

02:19:45
<transcript>: solar

02:19:47
<transcript>: Solar Array. Thank you.

02:19:47
<transcript>: thank you

02:19:49
<transcript>: Thank you.

02:19:55
glamshatterskull: i also have one but gorundmounted

02:19:58
<transcript>: So it's a quite a solar array, but it's on the south end of my house and the roof is such that there's just it's not visible really like no one would see it.

02:20:03
<transcript>: It would power it. Would you just be all of our electricity? I mean, it would be like.

02:20:10
<transcript>: A hundred percent of our usage. And it's this giant four batteries.

02:20:10
<transcript>: that does

02:20:15
<transcript>: That does like 108 continuous. It's a power goes off which is all cool.

02:20:18
<transcript>: And there's just so many tax benefits.

02:20:18
<transcript>: with solar right now

02:20:19
<transcript>: With Solar right now.

02:20:30
<transcript>: That it basically ends up costing very little. I just had to be out a lot of capital for a while and then I get it back on my taxes kind of thing. I know it's only 30%, but it gives more exotic than that. This company.

02:20:35
<transcript>: They have like a whole tax division and then.

02:20:35
<transcript>: they focus

02:20:41
<transcript>: They focus on this stuff. So there's just other kind of solar tax deduction you can get.

02:20:41
<transcript>: if

02:20:48
<transcript>: If you pay a lot in taxes, so I pay a lot in taxes. If you pay a lot in taxes, there are ways to get into solar.

02:20:48
<transcript>: and

02:20:51
<transcript>: And get a lot of money back.

02:20:51
<transcript>: on your taxes

02:20:54
dyalicode: hello

02:21:02
<transcript>: On your taxes. Anyway, I had a call yesterday with my accountant and this solar firm. And they they checked my accountants boxes. I got my accountants blessing.

02:21:03
<transcript>: So.

02:21:15
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't know. I'm thinking about this crazy, gigantic. It's a $200,000 solar array. I'm just gonna say it. It's a very expensive solar array. But I get most of that back in the form of tax credits.

02:21:26
<transcript>: I just had to be without it until tax season or whatever. They can also apply it to back to your taxes. They can go back one year. I don't know. There's a lot of.

02:21:26
<transcript>: trying to figure out

02:21:30
<transcript>: Trying to figure out if I'll do that. We're trying to decide if we want to put a pool in the backyard.

02:21:30
<transcript>: and that's kind of

02:21:37
<transcript>: And that's kind of like a whole nother conversation. We know we're in this house, like, for good. This is our dream home. We're not moving.

02:21:42
2dorkstv: oof. pool maintenance

02:21:43
<transcript>: But then it's like maintenance. There's just a lot going on, you know, when you got like.

02:21:43
<transcript>: you got a lot

02:21:48
2dorkstv: make a friend with a pool lol

02:21:57
lukeyfam15: Hello

02:21:59
thdxr: you might not have much income to deduct against if you become a full time educator LUL

02:22:03
<transcript>: You got a lot of projects. Pool maintenance. Yeah, I know. It sounds awful. We do a natural pool, which is like it uses, like, algae. There's, like, no chlorine. It uses this kind of like algae filter. Some people do them with living plants on the surface and the play. It's actually filter the water. It's kind of nuts. Lookie, it's been so long and dialys here.

02:22:10
<transcript>: Goreund mounted? What is Gordon Mounted? Glam.

02:22:14
<transcript>: We actually we built another home in this neighborhood.

02:22:14
<transcript>: like eight

02:22:21
glamshatterskull: *ground mounted

02:22:24
glamshatterskull: ffingers not awake yet

02:22:26
<transcript>: Like eight years ago. And we did solar on that one. We used the solar tiles. They're like flat on the roof. And they look pretty nice. But you still like they don't look the same color as the shingle. It's not the whole roof.

02:22:26
<transcript>: so

02:22:29
<transcript>: So it wasn't the best, but it was okay.

02:22:29
<transcript>: epic

02:22:30
<transcript>: Epic.

02:22:30
<transcript>: ep

02:22:35
ozdy: cheer10

02:22:35
<transcript>: Epic ought thank you for the follow. Thank you so much.

02:22:41
<transcript>: You might not have much income to deduct against if you become a full.

02:22:44
<transcript>: That's a great point, actually.

02:22:47
<transcript>: Thank you for the bits. Ozd.

02:22:48
ozdy: cheer10

02:22:51
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the cheering. The bits.

02:22:53
<transcript>: Why don't I see them.

02:22:53
<transcript>: as notification

02:22:55
<transcript>: As notifications.

02:22:55
<transcript>: okay

02:22:57
<transcript>: Okay. They're that one. I saw that one.

02:22:57
<transcript>: thank

02:22:57
ozdy: poverty bits but still

02:23:08
<transcript>: Thank you so much for your bits, Ozd. I appreciate it. Poverty bits, but still motor. Poverty bits. Oh, groundmounted. So I got you. So you put.

02:23:08
<transcript>: your solar

02:23:18
<transcript>: Your solar array on the ground. I've seen that my neighborhood. I don't really have room to do that. We've got, like, an acre. And we bought the lot next to us, which is another, like.

02:23:18
<transcript>: seventy five

02:23:21
lukeyfam15: Yeah i know, i just been watching other streamers.

02:23:23
<transcript>: 75 acre or something. We do have quite a bit of property, but I don't think we're allowed to put panels on the ground.

02:23:23
<transcript>: our hoa

02:23:25
<transcript>: Our HOA or whatever.

02:23:29
<transcript>: That's a good point, though, DAX. That's a great point.

02:23:37
<transcript>: I'm moving into a world where I may not have the task civil income, because I'm gonna just try and teach people. I'm gonna become a poor educator.

02:23:47
<transcript>: Luki. Totally fine. It's good to see you back. It's been a while. I miss a lot of folks. I miss Mark. I miss.

02:23:47
<transcript>: man

02:23:49
<transcript>: Mandy shows up sometimes.

02:23:58
<transcript>: That's just life though you got a venture out.

02:23:58
<transcript>: hang out with

02:24:00
<transcript>: Hang out with other people. Sometimes I get it.

02:24:04
<transcript>: All right? I already.

02:24:08
<transcript>: Not doing it for me right now.

02:24:15
<transcript>: Yes. So someone could just, like, make all the decisions in my life. For me, that would be fantastic, actually.

02:24:17
<transcript>: We're doing a bunch of landscaping.

02:24:17
<transcript>: they're supposed to start that

02:24:19
<transcript>: They're supposed to start that later this month.

02:24:20
ozdy: Too passive :(

02:24:24
delvoid: flip a coin easyy

02:24:25
<transcript>: So, yeah, we're trying to side on a pool, trying to decide on this solar thing.

02:24:25
<transcript>: try to decide

02:24:33
daneoshiga: decisions as a Service

02:24:37
<transcript>: Try to decide we want to do a fire table, like a fire pit. And then we have to, like, run natural gas. And it's like a hole. Just a lot. A lot. And the exterior of my home, that's taking up my brain space, you know.

02:24:48
<transcript>: Flip a coin. Hey, that's not a bad idea. Decisions as a service. How about Twitch check.

02:24:48
<transcript>: making

02:24:50
<transcript>: Making all my decisions. That sounds fantastic.

02:25:05
lukeyfam15: I haven't actually seen you live much.

02:25:08
<transcript>: Dax and I are gonna start recording AWS FM. It's a podcast. If you're somebody who cares about any of this and you know about our podcast. Aws FM. I just said our podcast acts. I'm just handing it to you.

02:25:11
popcorntoohot: nah we just need a tool to ask reddit for advice

02:25:12
<transcript>: It's a pocket. I started, like a year ago.

02:25:12
<transcript>: and

02:25:13
<transcript>: And.

02:25:13
<transcript>: i've done thirty

02:25:20
<transcript>: I've done 32 episodes, and they've all just been like, interview a person in AWS community about.

02:25:20
<transcript>: them

02:25:21
<transcript>: Them.

02:25:31
popcorntoohot: but use random accounts so people dont start judging you

02:25:32
delvoid: wait i didnt know you did a podcast

02:25:32
<transcript>: And I just got really tired of trying to schedule guests and try to like, there's so many people I love the interview and have. But, like, how do you choose? That's the problem. There's too many choices.

02:25:32
<transcript>: so i

02:25:42
thdxr: shifting aws.fm shifting into hot take mode

02:25:45
<transcript>: So I hit 32. It's like a power of two. And I was like, That's a good stopping point. So I've been taking kind of a break. Then I thought, like, I'd love to just get on with DAX and just talk about stuff. Just talk about stuff that we care about.

02:26:05
<transcript>: It's gonna be hot take mode. That's right. We're just gonna we're gonna let it fly, and I'm very excited to get it back going in a very different format. I think that's I think I'm gonna do, like, totally new form. Like, It's not gonna be the intro music. I'm not gonna say that dumb thing is the beginning. I'm like, hey, everyone, welcome. Native SFM.

02:26:05
<transcript>: i remember

02:26:12
<transcript>: I remember we're gonna like, revamp it everything. I might make a new logo. New color skate. Just everything's gonna be different.

02:26:12
<transcript>: just to like

02:26:12
thdxr: make it like a talk show?

02:26:14
<transcript>: Just to like refresh and feel good about it.

02:26:16
darthtrooper14: !podcast

02:26:22
<transcript>: Like a talk show. It's gonna be like me. And you talking about whatever. I don't even care what we talk about.

02:26:22
<transcript>: it'll end up being

02:26:24
<transcript>: It'll end up being related to AWS. I'm sure.

02:26:30
<transcript>: Excuse to get on the phone and talk, and I think people will listen. I think.

02:26:39
<transcript>: We gotta capitalize on the domain I've got AWS FM is a domain, you know that's a good domain. It's a good idea for a podcast name.

02:26:46
<transcript>: But, yeah, we're gonna do new music. New. Everything. It's gonna be there's no podcast. Command. Sorry. Dart trooper.

02:26:46
<transcript>: but it is just

02:26:49
<transcript>: But it is just AWS FM if you go there.

02:26:54
<transcript>: Yeah. We'll start that next week. Hopefully, DAX will start recording.

02:26:54
<transcript>: i know

02:26:56
popcorntoohot: (aws.fm)^2 edition

02:27:01
<transcript>: I know. We'll just every 30 minutes. We'll stop it. And that'll be an episode. And then we'll talk for another 30 minutes. That'll be another episode.

02:27:05
<transcript>: Second Edition. That's right.

02:27:05
daneoshiga: I've listened to one with Kyle as I was working with him in BC, need to listen the other ones

02:27:10
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:27:14
<transcript>: Whoa, Daniel.

02:27:14
<transcript>: you work with

<transcript>: You work with Kyle at Brightcore.

02:27:21
<transcript>: I worked at Breadcore. Did you know that? Daniel.

02:27:26
<transcript>: Did you know that I worked at Brightcour? Because I did. That's how I know. Kyle.

02:27:32
<transcript>: I spent a while back. I guess it's been like a couple years ago.

02:27:34
<transcript>: Since I worked there.

02:27:41
<transcript>: Yeah. Why is why is there always so much going on? I feel like I did it to myself.

02:27:45
daneoshiga: ah yeah, kind of how I ended up here xD I've joined long after you left I believe

02:27:46
<transcript>: I've made these problems. Now I have to live with these problems.

02:27:51
<transcript>: But there's just like, there's just so many things.

02:28:05
<transcript>: So many things at any given time that just give me, like, anxiety. I'm just, like, constantly thinking about things I should be doing. I should be making decisions on that or doing this or whatever our homeschool situation. So we've got a seven year old.

02:28:05
<transcript>: and

02:28:05
thdxr: what's the point of life if you're not going to do everything

02:28:06
<transcript>: And.

02:28:11
<transcript>: He would not do great. I don't think in a public school setting. So we home school.

02:28:11
<transcript>: we're not

02:28:15
<transcript>: We're not like our kids have to be homeschooled.

02:28:15
<transcript>: we're

02:28:18
<transcript>: We're open like at my two year old when he's older, if he wants to go to public school.

02:28:18
<transcript>: well he's

02:28:23
<transcript>: Well, he's not gonna public school if he wants to go to private school. Bingo. Private school. But.

02:28:34
<transcript>: Our oldest ASA. He just does better, I think, at home. But homeschooling is a whole thing. And like curriculums and.

02:28:34
<transcript>: just trying not to

02:28:40
<transcript>: Just trying not to do the thing that everybody does because everybody does. It like, what's the best way to educate your kids? That's the thing that.

02:28:44
<transcript>: My wife and our consulate talking about and trying to figure out.

02:28:46
thdxr: also planning on home schooling but there's communities here that make it easier

02:28:48
2dorkstv: we tried homeschooling our little guy during covid. But it was kindergarten and that was tough 0_o

02:28:51
<transcript>: What's the point of life if you're not going to do everything, that's a great. That's a great question, DAX. Apparently, that's my motto. I didn't know it, but.

02:28:56
<transcript>: Yeah, kindergarten.

02:28:58
<transcript>: Homeschooling is not easy.

02:29:03
<transcript>: We did the first grade thing last year. We're doing second grade this year.

02:29:08
<transcript>: Yeah, home school is a whole thing. A whole topic.

02:29:14
<transcript>: Dax. We're also playing out homeschooling.

02:29:23
<transcript>: Yeah, we don't have. I guess we haven't looked into the communities thing. There's. Like there's definitely options, like homeschooling, coops and stuff.

02:29:25
2dorkstv: he listens to other people better than he listens to us lol

02:29:27
<transcript>: We could certainly.

02:29:27
<transcript>: benefit

02:29:30
<transcript>: Benefit probably from some of those community's.

02:29:35
<transcript>: Listen to other people better, since do I not listen to you guys.

02:29:35
<transcript>: oh you're

02:29:37
<transcript>: Oh, you're saying you're a kid? I take your time about me.

02:29:37
<transcript>: such a n

02:29:39
<transcript>: Such a narcissist.

02:29:39
<transcript>: so

02:29:45
<transcript>: So your kid listens to other people better than listen to us. Yeah. That's the thing. It's hard is keeping.

02:29:45
<transcript>: our

02:29:47
<transcript>: Our very active.

02:29:47
<transcript>: seven

02:29:49
<transcript>: Seven year old.

02:29:52
<transcript>: Photo Focused on something.

02:29:52
<transcript>: like

02:30:00
mr_yan19: I take it public school in the US isn't great then?

02:30:08
<transcript>: Like you said him in front of a like, giant 18 year old plus Lego set. And he will knock it out. He'll set there for 6 hours straight and focus on only that Lego set. He's built some amazing things that I just don't think a seven year old should be able to do or focus for that long. But like you said him in front of somebody.

02:30:08
<transcript>: and it's

02:30:10
<transcript>: And it's like.

02:30:12
thdxr: Primer is opening up microschools near us: https://primer.com/microschools

02:30:13
<transcript>: I'd rather do anything else.

02:30:13
<transcript>: than try to keep

02:30:19
<transcript>: Than try to keep my kids focused on homework or not. Homework. It's all homework, I guess.

02:30:21
thdxr: I went to an amazing US public school but it varies

02:30:24
<transcript>: Mr. Yann, welcome to Chat. I take it public school in the US isn't great then.

02:30:26
thesirfry: It's cause it's boring and they're a child lol

02:30:26
<transcript>: You know.

02:30:31
<transcript>: I went to public school. I loved my time in a public school.

02:30:33
<transcript>: I think like.

02:30:33
<transcript>: actually

02:30:38
2dorkstv: public school definitely depends largely on the area you're in

02:30:43
<transcript>: Actually the area we live in supposed to have great public school, like the Nixa Public School. Soliciti. Fantastic. As far as our steak goes, I think it's just like.

02:30:43
<transcript>: public school

02:30:47
thdxr: Schooling at scale just doesn't work well.  I was so bored in school and ended up turning into a terrible student

02:30:51
thdxr: but I liked learning

02:30:53
daneoshiga: how about kids socializing while in homescholing, how does it work? *homescholing isn't even allowed here

02:30:57
<transcript>: Public school kind of terrifies me in the US. I don't know. Maybe I'm just an alarmist, but just the obsession with guns, especially here in the Ozarks. Everyone has guns. Every kid probably owns guns for hunting. And like just that whole.

02:30:57
<transcript>: situation

02:31:03
<transcript>: Situation in the US it'd be really hard for me to send my kid to school every day in public school and not feel like.

02:31:03
<transcript>: there's

02:31:07
mr_yan19: oh right.  I didn't think of the gun thing....

02:31:15
<transcript>: There's this risk of some kid bringing his hunting rifles. School. I don't know. I don't know again. Maybe that's alarmist, but like, have you seen the news? The US just. It's just not.

02:31:16
mr_yan19: I gotcha now

02:31:19
thdxr: yeah also worried about the gun thing - I'm in Florida lol

02:31:23
<transcript>: Primer is opening up Microschools near US Microsoft Schools. What are these? I will check a look. I'll take a look at that.

02:31:27
delvoid: the social aspect is the part i would not want my kids missing out on

02:31:37
<transcript>: Because they're boring at their child. Exactly. So we try to do as much stuff that's not boring teaching our kid as possible, but it's hard. Public school definitely depends largely on area, and Yeah.

02:31:55
<transcript>: I was a bad student to deck. I love learning, I love College, the bit I was there before I just started playing video games like I love, I love listening to lectures, audiobooks like I'm very much in to learning. But I was not a great student.

02:31:58
thdxr: Microschools = mixed ages, small class sizes, self paced and kids can build their own curriculum around what they're into

02:32:01
daryn_dev: What's a school?

02:32:01
2dorkstv: there are a lot of ways to get that outside of school though. sports teams, co-ops, neighborhood stuff, etc.

02:32:15
<transcript>: How about kids socializing? Well, in home schooling. How does it work? So we actually have a street full of kids that are our kids age. So we benefit. There's, like, eight kids on this street that they all play together. They run around each other's yards. It's really great. We've got a really great neighborhood. So he kind of gets the social aspect that way.

02:32:15
<transcript>: they're all

02:32:16
<transcript>: They're all in public school.

02:32:28
<transcript>: So he's missing that part of it. And I know he's around kids a lot less than most kids, but he's at least getting some social interaction and kind of learning how to exist amongst other kids.

02:32:34
<transcript>: Yeah. The gun thing. Yeah.

02:32:47
<transcript>: Mixed stages, small class sizes, self paced, and kids can build their own curriculum around what they're into. That sounds amazing. Okay. I'm looking into Microschools primer.

02:32:49
<transcript>: That sounds amazing.

02:32:52
thesirfry: do you only have the one child?

02:33:15
<transcript>: And.

02:33:15
<transcript>: it's very hands

02:33:23

thesirfry: LUL

02:34:47
sockthedev: I've got twins üòÖ

02:34:53
<transcript>: The thing my wife and always talk about is that with kids, people who don't have kids. Like the way I would explain it is the Hyzer way higher. Like the moments in life that are just amazing are higher than ever. But the lows are also way loader lower. Like the extremes of life just get amplified, amplified. So we look back on our life before we had kids. And it was like.

02:34:57
<transcript>: Just. It was kind of like this. You didn't really.

02:34:57
<transcript>: steady

02:34:57
2dorkstv: that's exactly the way I put it. highs are higher, lows are lower

02:34:57
daryn_dev: @sockthedev - South Arkansas? xD

02:35:07
daryn_dev: South Arizona?

02:35:10
<transcript>: Steady. Everything was. And like, you never got that excited. But you never got that down. When you have kids, you get very excited about some things. And some days are the best. And some days are the worst. It's just. But I wouldn't trade it like, it's the best.

02:35:12
thesirfry: true

02:35:16
<transcript>: Your timing is being peekable. That's right. Finite. Finite. This is. I'm leaving.

02:35:21

02:35:23
<transcript>: I have only known you for like three days.

02:35:25
2dorkstv: the quicker you can let go of what you want and focus on what you have, the better off you are

02:35:29
<transcript>: Also, South Africa socks. A Dev. Okay, we got a couple of stuff. South Africa.

delvoid: i got a 5year old, 4year old and new born. No more now this lil one is killing us xD

02:35:39
<transcript>: Thank you for the followup. Kung Fury.

02:35:53
<transcript>: Ooh sock. This has twins. I've always admired people who survive twins. I feel like getting it within your first sock. Like, your first kids were twins because that feels like it would be so much to be like, go from no kids to immediately. You have two.

02:35:55
<transcript>: Sounds tough.

02:35:59
<transcript>: Hyes are higher than the lows are lower.

02:36:02
<transcript>: South Arkansas.

02:36:04
<transcript>: South Arizona.

02:36:04
thdxr: twins seems like hell but also kinda nice because you get past 2 at once

02:36:05
thelogyhd: 2 for the price of 1

02:36:07
sockthedev: nope, have an older daughter

02:36:11
sockthedev: insanely harder

02:36:14
finitesingularity: Friends of ours had 2, and wanted one more.... Triplets...

02:36:16
<transcript>: The quicker you can let go. This is good. The clicker, the quicker you can let go of what you want and focus on what you have. The better off you are. That's good stuff. Can I pin that to my channel? That's a good quote.

02:36:17
sockthedev: makes 1 seem easy

02:36:24
<transcript>: I got a five year old, four year old and Newburn newborn no more. Now.

02:36:44
<transcript>: This one, the slow one is killing us. That's the other thing. I've got two. And how different each child can be. And how, like, our first was a really hard first year. Like our first child. Now we know was really a challenge. We just thought that was parenting. He was a really difficult baby. He, like, hated being a baby.

02:36:44
<transcript>: i think

02:36:47
mr_yan19: I have 1 and that was enough for me

02:36:49
<transcript>: I think it's our theory. He just hated that he couldn't be up and moving around and doing stuff.

02:36:49
<transcript>: so he was really

02:36:51
<transcript>: So he was really tough.

02:36:51
<transcript>: and our

02:36:56
sockthedev: yeah, twins pay dividends once they get to coplay stage

02:36:56
<transcript>: And our second was a really easy baby. But then they kind of like, trade off. And then, like.

02:36:56
<transcript>: our second

02:37:00
finitesingularity: Mrs. S and I had the discussion if we wanted a third..  and we both agreed, zone defense sucks.. so 2 and done. :D

02:37:05
<transcript>: Our second has been more challenging, and it's two going into three, whereas our oldest, he was super easy during that stretch. So it's like they kind of have different.

02:37:07
<transcript>: Tradeoffs.

02:37:07
<transcript>: it's amazing though

02:37:14
<transcript>: It's amazing, though, how different two kids can be. Like, yeah, I have two boys. And they're completely different.

02:37:19
<transcript>: Twins seem like hell, but also kind of nice because you get past to it once. That's true.

02:37:19
<transcript>: you two for the price of

02:37:20
sockthedev: as always have a friend to play with, where with my first i was the 100% entertainment

02:37:22
<transcript>: You two for the price of ones. Welcome to Chat logey.

02:37:24
thdxr: zone defense sucks haha

02:37:28
<transcript>: Okay. So you already had a daughter. Insanely. Harder. Interesting.

02:37:33
<transcript>: Friends of ours had two and one in one more triplets.

02:37:36
<transcript>: Oof, that's tough.

02:37:36
<transcript>: trip

02:37:40
2dorkstv: we're one and done. Our kid was so tough, plus postpartum depression wrecked us. Never again(tm) lol

02:37:40
<transcript>: Triplets would be tough. That would make one seem easy for sure.

02:37:43
thesirfry: our second is a daughter and the diaper situation is for sure harder

02:37:47
<transcript>: Yeah. One was enough for you. We thought we were done after one. We did not plan.

02:37:51
<transcript>: For two. But we couldn't imagine life without our second. Now.

02:37:57
thdxr: how are babies made?

02:37:57
<transcript>: Missing this and I had decision. If we want a third, we both agreed. Don't. Defense sucks.

02:37:59
thesirfry: "is a daughter" LUL

02:38:01
<transcript>: Funny.

02:38:02
thelogyhd: I am fellow twin, my parents said it was a chaotic time LuL

02:38:08
<transcript>: Yeah. The copaying thing. So, like just having two kids is so much easier in that way that they play together.

02:38:08
<transcript>: i

02:38:14
<transcript>: I imagine with twins too. Yeah, that makes sense. They be same stage of development.

02:38:23
<transcript>: Your kid was so tough. Plus postpartum repression rectus? Yeah, never again.

02:38:29
thesirfry: @thdxr you can pick one up from ikea

02:38:32
