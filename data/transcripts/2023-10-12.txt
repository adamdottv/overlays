alexandersupertramp29: where have you been

00:18:41
bronifty: He is a contributor to winglang which is based on cdk

00:18:42
longhumans: the screen flashes have something to do with OBS --> settings --> Advanced --> Video Section --> switching color range from 'full' to 'partial'. Strager had the same issue on his stream as well.

00:19:11
longhumans: Had to restart stream after that change tho.

00:19:13

fragaverage: switched from auto to 1080p, flashes gone

00:23:30

daneoshiga: stream's theme: have you guys seem flash?

00:23:57
rvnn: I switched from Auto to 1080 and the flashing stopped

00:24:08
fragaverage: @adamdotdev switch the one you're watching to 720p, it'll flash

00:24:32
adriandotjs: yeah, 720p is flashing

00:24:37
rvnn: yeah 720

00:24:43
cowfacedev: perks of being around for long. you get to call out the streamer LUL

00:24:49
oetziofficial: it usually would say 1080p60

00:24:52
cowfacedev: no flashes on 1080p

00:29:26
developmentrobot: oh he's back

00:29:28
mattgoslow: @rvnn Thanks 👍

00:29:35
enzujp: Love the song!

00:29:38
antstanley: https://namechk.com/ is good for searching available domain names

00:30:14
mooosa: damn timed out

00:30:17
aj_stuyvenberg: no back seat domaining <- rules are rules

00:30:35
pbertrand_dev: no its 1080 degrees

00:30:36
privann: @adamdotdev why don't you reuse existing domain and invest the money in Tesla Stocks instead

00:30:42
fragaverage: you're vertical

00:30:56
rvnn: 4080 >>> 1080

00:31:08
developmentrobot: buying the domain before you do

00:31:13
aj_stuyvenberg: bedrock!

00:31:15
aj_stuyvenberg: let's goooo

00:31:19
oetziofficial: what is bedrock?

00:31:24
sockthedev: YAAAASSSS!!!!

00:31:42
aj_stuyvenberg: @OetziOfficial it's AWS's LLM platform. You can plug in a bunch of different models with the same API contract.

00:31:50
sixfourtwelve: You know like in superhero movies their wardrobe is just their super suits, I bet Adams is just black t shirts

00:31:52
oetziofficial: @aj_stuyvenberg POGGERS

00:32:00
bodhihawken: I do love the slack API, we built a customer support tool in slack so you can reply inline to customers via WhatsApp, SMS ect in a day

00:32:03
aj_stuyvenberg: @OetziOfficial poggers indeed

00:32:17
rvnn: is there a tl.dr ?

00:32:21
thdxr: adam did you already setup bedrock

00:32:24
thdxr: there’s a delay

00:32:31
thdxr: you have to request access and it takes time

00:32:36
cohan: Inb4 it's a premium one that it needs to check before it realises

00:32:38
antstanley: tldr.cheap sounds right

00:32:53
fragaverage: why is your chat so large!!!!!

00:32:53
rvnn: sick angle view

00:32:58
oetziofficial: oh the table is clean!

00:33:03
aj_stuyvenberg: Adam probably has access through the hero program already. Just check us-west-2

00:33:06
antstanley: click 'show more'

00:33:07
privann: @adamdotdev cloudflare?

00:33:17
thdxr: do that now

00:33:19
privann: @adamdotdev cloudflare have hosted GPUs for running llvms

00:33:28
sockthedev: tldr.land

cohan: tldrbot, let's you add other services later

00:34:32
thdxr: kiwi died :(

00:34:34
hicat_pl: tldr.si

00:34:52
fragaverage: that domain checker is rubbish! .ch is taken

00:35:12
thdxr: no on the left you have to access models

00:35:19
thdxr: request models

00:35:30
developmentrobot: opening that directly on stream was riskyyy

00:35:31
manbravegg: theme looks trash

00:35:32
cohan: I usually use iwantmyname's search for domains

00:35:55
cohan: Seems a bit less spotty on false positives

00:36:08
oetziofficial: TLDR.CEO woooow

00:36:09
hicat_pl: also tldr.sl is free

00:36:17
cohan: Set it up on tldr.Adam.dev for now and come back to spending money (the fun bit) later LUL

00:36:35
antstanley: tldr.af is available

00:36:40
pbertrand_dev: @adamdotdev get tldrch.at

00:36:54
daglee: You should buy lära.bar

00:36:59
thdxr: it’s very confusing

00:37:04
thdxr: i’d recommend the claude ai

00:37:08
aj_stuyvenberg: claude is good

00:37:11
thdxr: anthropic

00:37:13
cohan: Haha my new rule for me, if I've not deployed it as a subdomain I'm not allowed the domain yet LUL

00:37:25
cowfacedev: You don't have enough domains LUL

00:37:28
marcelbischoff: Anthropic is the conpanh

00:37:33
marcelbischoff: Claude the model

00:37:41
marcelbischoff: *company

00:38:00
thdxr: there’s a section in the left panel somewhere

thdxr: i was also confused

00:38:14
rvnn: Comedy?

00:39:01
antstanley: your desk is too clean

00:39:14
marcelbischoff: Yes

00:39:27
thdxr: yes

00:39:42
pbertrand_dev: Jurrasic 2 can only be used to generate dinasaur names

00:39:52
antstanley: use Stable Diffusion to generate images

00:39:58
oetziofficial: FailFish

00:40:14
antstanley: images = dinosaurs

00:40:33
antstanley: please generate dinosaurs

00:41:28
daglee: Unless I put the stream in 1080p, twitch is flashing every 3 seconds. Come on twitch...

00:41:30
antstanley: no Bun's in the oven

daglee: I happens for other streamers too after twitch updated something.

00:43:18
thdxr: wait wait wait

00:43:18
bodhihawken: You can still get slack to call your API if you want, slack apps are just an option

00:43:21
antstanley: Slack has Apps and Workflows... Workflows run on their infra, Apps are on yours

00:43:28
aj_stuyvenberg: big salesforce energy

00:43:29
thdxr: why do you want to deploy it on slack infra?

00:43:34
thdxr: you don’t have to do that

00:43:50
pbertrand_dev: yeah use digital ocean

00:43:51
antstanley: just build a small proxy function to call your infra

00:44:13
thdxr: oh tou have to use workflows?

00:44:20
thdxr: lol is jason getting paid

00:45:03
aj_stuyvenberg: presumably

00:45:25
antstanley: 💸

00:46:13
marcelbischoff: yes

00:46:14
aj_stuyvenberg: Salesforce did buy slack

00:46:16
drama321: Yeah they did

00:46:22

00:46:45
thdxr: adam regrets agreeing to this

00:49:00
aj_stuyvenberg: yeah open the chat playground

00:49:12
aj_stuyvenberg: You can add your prompt and it'll give you the API call

00:49:20
antstanley: Claude is waaaaay cheaper than GPT

00:49:39
aj_stuyvenberg: oh boy

00:49:46
antstanley: you probably want to use Langchain to work with Bedrock

00:49:59
aj_stuyvenberg: hit the check box

00:51:02
sigaocaue: hey guys, my first time here. What are u doing? What application are u developing?

oetziofficial: yes, you still have the checkmark lol

aj_stuyvenberg: okay now you can feed twitch chat into bedrock.

00:55:29
developmentrobot: why no streams :(

developmentrobot: they were: "See you tomorrow"

00:56:47

00:58:49
cohan: I might have been thinking it at the time,maybe the AI is psychic

00:58:52
trivenge: hiya @thdxr

00:58:56

00:58:58
thdxr: hey!

00:59:07
trivenge: oh you got the checkmark! i love it! well deserved

00:59:13
aj_stuyvenberg: hahaha dang

00:59:33
cohan: Use editor regex to search replace LUL

00:59:37
techsavvytravvy: shit dax is here i'm out

00:59:56
fragaverage: so stressed in here

00:59:58
antstanley: the Human thing is specific to Claude v2

01:00:07
trivenge: basically adams stream is a bunch of people who shit on dax for two hours, anyone ever notice that? LUL

01:00:22
thdxr: people keep trying tot see me down

01:00:29
thdxr: take*

01:00:31
trivenge: KEKW

01:00:32
aj_stuyvenberg: LOOOOOL

01:00:33

01:00:34
snow_saram: lmfaoooo

01:00:41
fragaverage: this is stressing me out

01:00:48
aj_stuyvenberg: WAIT WE WERE

01:01:09
aj_stuyvenberg: try clearing context, start a new chat with your same prompt?

01:01:12
thdxr: adam you have to tweak temperature

01:01:32
aj_stuyvenberg: start new chat, upper right

01:01:53
trivenge: is temperature the sole aspect responsible for precision of context?

01:01:58
thdxr: i got dog poop all over my hands

01:02:06
trivenge: and you are typing right now?

01:02:31
fragaverage: higher temp is move creative freedom I believe

01:02:38
aj_stuyvenberg: AYYYY

01:02:45
thdxr: turn it down to zero

01:03:08
techsavvytravvy: ya i never allow creative freedom, overrated

01:03:26
freedomdao: amazon make their own model soon u see

01:03:40
thdxr: it’s iam powered lol

01:03:49
antstanley: https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/models/llms/integrations/bedrock is your friend

01:03:49
freedomdao: because token abstraction

01:03:57
cohan: "Be concise" at the start of all my prompts haha

01:04:02
freedomdao: imagine your thoughts internally vs speaking externally they can only "think" texternally"

01:04:04
thdxr: ask for a 3-4 sentence paragraph summary

01:04:30
antstanley: also ts

01:04:53
adjectiveallison: no way

01:05:02
adjectiveallison: ohh claude 2 on bedrock?

01:05:11
trivenge: @AdjectiveAllison  :O

01:05:21
freedomdao: You can ask to reply in a single word on other models this model is weak

01:05:31
freedomdao: try llama2 7b thebroke chat model.

01:05:38
antstanley: Hope you're using @thdxr's credit card for the AWS bill here

01:05:46
oetziofficial: that looks good!

01:05:55
cohan: Getting better!

01:06:19
freedomdao: actually a single word reply can determine a lot of things. for example "examine this text for any sexual content" "reply no if it has any bias that is not appropriate" thats called a moderation prompt ;)

01:06:20
thdxr: that’s pretty good

01:06:25
manbravegg: good thing its the ai's job to summarize and not yours Kappa

01:06:32
adjectiveallison: adam I'm so excited that you're getting into LLMs.

01:06:36
thdxr: you don’t need langchain

01:06:44
freedomdao: if you are deploying a single layer, you will face a security flaw. Prompt injection.

01:06:47
freedomdao: good luck.

01:06:57
antstanley: all those AWS deps will also work

01:07:04
thdxr: latest aws sdk v3 has bedrock

01:07:24
adjectiveallison: are you in retrieval and vector stores?

01:07:25
antstanley: Dax is right, you don't need Langchain, but it does make your life easier... it's just an abstraction

01:07:51
oetziofficial: why Deno?

01:07:51
antstanley: v3 does

01:07:58
thdxr: it’s just a single call to the LLM pretty simple

01:08:00
adjectiveallison: roger that

01:08:02
freedomdao: by single layer, i mean direct user access to these models , the user can over-write and prompt system logic into the bot. making the bot possible do SQL injection. all data must be santized in and out.

01:08:02
manbravegg: @OetziOfficial why not

01:08:13
thdxr: i’d just put it behind an apig so you can set it up outside of slack

01:08:20
thdxr: and not worry about iam stuff in slack

01:08:24
freedomdao: for example i can make your LLM do a SQL injection attack, dump your user DB tables to me, through the chat.

01:08:26
freedomdao: that's easy

01:08:39
adjectiveallison: I agree with dax, just using the striaght up API call to LLM is the move

01:08:47
bronifty: You can create a bucket with the SDK i didn’t know that

01:09:24
bronifty: Was playing around with architect for aws whose twitter account stopped posting after they retweeted Adam

01:09:32
thdxr: nah i’d do a lambda function

01:09:44
aj_stuyvenberg: you probably want lambda, function URLs, and response streaming for LLM

01:09:48
thdxr: and just do all the prompt stuff in there

01:10:11
thdxr: idk if streaming is needed because slack can’t stream the response

01:10:16
aj_stuyvenberg: oh then nevermind

01:10:33
adjectiveallison: I don't know if you're actually back, but it is good to see you and I hope you do more of these :) I'm running for now, have a good day!

01:10:33
freedomdao: @aj_stuyvenberg we do streaming it is way better because inference times are lower

01:10:43
freedomdao: slack can stream the reply with chunking

01:10:44
mvpopuk: Isn't Dracula colors too bright ?

01:10:44
antstanley: Brian still very active on Twitter/X

01:10:45
freedomdao: ive done it

01:11:23
freedomdao: also chatgpt etc.. they all do streaming

01:11:46
thdxr: i’d put both in one repo

01:11:51
aj_stuyvenberg: @freedomdao ah makes sense

01:11:55
thdxr: just different subfolders

01:12:11
oetziofficial: maybe put it into sst, and from there it would be in the packages/slackapp right? so you have all in one

01:12:13
freedomdao: even better than this setup... i suggest "microsoft autogen" style deployments with agents, more than one ai prompt , actually 3... working as one system.

01:12:27
psibear: Vids or it didn't happen

01:12:50
freedomdao: most of what i started with, non agent setup. single prompt. now everything is moving towards the agents. for safety too

01:13:07
techsavvytravvy: lol you fuck

01:13:16
aj_stuyvenberg: wow first follower, let's go

01:13:35
psibear: @freedomdao Are you doing agent stuff? I'm just starting to try it

01:13:46
antstanley: the best jokes are the ones you  have to explain

01:14:04
psibear: @adamdotdev Feel free to jump in

gtcrais: if it's not taken it probably costs a milyin

02:51:35
naxodev: i just bought it

02:51:38
texoport: :D

02:51:41
naxodev: you can buy it from me

02:51:51
oetziofficial: lol

02:52:14
gtcrais: tldrchat.com ?

02:52:28
naxodev: one BTC and it is yours

02:52:49
abradabroad: what about TL.DR

02:53:09
texoport: @aBradAbroad is dr a valid tld

02:53:21
abradabroad: meh, would have been cool

02:53:27
gtcrais: tld.read

02:53:31
texoport: that would have been hella expensive

02:53:58
oetziofficial: domain parking....

02:54:05
thdxr: it's all the other devs like you buying domains

02:54:20
texoport: yeah, dot dr

02:54:31
texoport: dot soy!

02:54:48
abradabroad: THE flip

02:54:53
tobs_on_twitch: here goes nothing...

02:54:58
ayushsharma: Does every domain cost money ?

02:55:08
mvpopuk: tldr.exposed

02:55:31
cowfacedev: we buying another domain?

02:55:33
thdxr: only got 50min left adam

02:55:34
texoport: tldr should be a tld, honestly

02:55:36
thdxr: before we TALK

02:55:40
grasp5533: I'm west coast now, and I'm just getting here T_T

02:56:21
thdxr: if adam.dev is on cloudflare just don't use a custom domain on AWS and proxy it through CF

02:56:40
texoport: leek city

02:56:47
tobs_on_twitch: yeah just 99.99% chance I don't get it

02:56:51
grasp5533: @thdxr Would you have Michael Liendo/Focus Otter on the podcast?

02:57:01
cowfacedev: just set a

02:57:10
thdxr: yeah point to apig and turn on the cloudflare icon

02:57:11
cowfacedev: just set a A record.

02:57:23
cowfacedev: that's how I host my websites

02:57:25
thdxr: cname

02:57:51
naxodev: one tip for people in the chat, parking npm orgs is even worse

02:58:03
cowfacedev: apparently it's been a while since I've used the cloudflare dashboard

03:00:57
thdxr: i hate apig authorizers

03:01:04
thdxr: just throw a check in your lambda func

03:01:50
thdxr: i never use apig authorizers so i don't know

03:02:06
thdxr: they suck!

03:02:10
thdxr: why add another lambda in between

03:02:16
thdxr: even if is cached

03:02:47
thdxr: just create a `assertAuth() { useHeader("Authorization") }` function and throw it at the top of each of your lambda functions

03:03:26
thdxr: you're being such a solutions architect rn

03:03:33
texoport: :D

03:04:18
thdxr: i think `authorization` has to be lowercase - i've been meaning to normalize this

03:04:30
thdxr: `new Config.Secret`

03:04:45
thdxr: bind: [new Config.Secret(stack, "ADAM_SUCKS")]

03:05:37
thdxr: Config.ADAM_SUCKS

03:05:40
doesawesomestuff: Hey!

03:06:07
thdxr: you can even extract this to its own function and do `throw new Response(401)`

03:06:40
thdxr: i think the arg is the same as an apig response

03:06:42
thdxr: so statusCode: 401

03:06:50
thdxr: wait it's not that Response

03:06:52
thdxr: nvm don't use this

03:07:02
thdxr: it's using the wrong Response

03:07:06
grasp5533: back seat programming

03:07:22
thdxr: i think it's from the first import

03:07:37
thdxr: yeah but the throw is useful if you want to take it out into your own function

03:08:07
thdxr: yeah

03:08:32
thdxr: it's the context system no one knows about because i haven't released it lol

03:09:13
grasp5533: Adam you gonna be streaming more regularly?

03:11:44
texoport: is it just me or is the stream flashing every few seconds?
