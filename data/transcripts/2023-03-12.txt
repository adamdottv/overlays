11:57:07
<transcript>: The weirdest career in existence.

11:57:12
<transcript>: Why do we all have side projects? What are their career paths.

11:57:12
<transcript>: do

11:57:20
<transcript>: Do you work all day at your job and then you go home and you think about doing more work for yourself. But it's the same work.

11:57:23
<transcript>: Like.

11:57:27
<transcript>: I literally.

11:57:28
<transcript>: After.

11:57:28
<transcript>: i

11:57:31
<transcript>: I once spent 18 months.

11:57:31
<transcript>: developing

11:57:32
<transcript>: Developing.

11:57:32
<transcript>: a side project

11:57:35
<transcript>: A side project but I didn't launch.

11:57:42
<transcript>: I spent the better part of the last year building public dev, and I finally decided to sunset it.

11:57:45
<transcript>: So much pain.

11:58:19
<transcript>: Element is the weirdest career in existence.

11:58:27
<transcript>: I've been working on a side project for the better part of the last year.

11:58:40
<transcript>: in my career

11:58:40
<transcript>: And it's called Public dev. Finally sunsetting. It so painful to decide to be done with the side project but it's side project number like 450.

11:58:47
<transcript>: In my career what other career do you have aside? Project constantly. You constantly have more work you're doing.

11:58:53
<transcript>: In hopes of making it big. Imagine if doctors got home and they're like.

11:58:59
<transcript>: Imagine if lawyers went home and they're just like.

11:59:09
<transcript>: Imagine if lawyers always had a side project.

11:59:13
<transcript>: Always had like a side personal lawsuit they were working on.

11:59:21
<transcript>: Imagine if lawyers always had a side project like, they go home. They're working on some.

11:59:21
<transcript>: class action

11:59:24
<transcript>: Class action lawsuit that they think is gonna make it big.

11:59:29
<transcript>: Or doctors that go home.

11:59:32
<transcript>: Or if every doctor.

11:59:38
<transcript>: Clocked off and or if every Doctor clocked off and then.

11:59:41
<transcript>: Tried to figure out the cure for cancer.

11:59:44
<transcript>: Why can't we just calm down.

11:59:50
<transcript>: I sense a better part of the last year building public Dev.

11:59:50
<transcript>: so this is the next

11:59:53
<transcript>: the last thing

11:59:53
<transcript>: So this is the next big side project of mine that was gonna be.

11:59:55
<transcript>: and i finally

11:59:55
<transcript>: The last thing I ever did.

11:59:58
<transcript>: And I finally after just painting.

12:00:05
<transcript>: Grips that I need to.

12:00:05
<transcript>: say goodbye to

12:00:08
<transcript>: finally

12:00:08
<transcript>: Say goodbye to this side Project and sunset it it's so painful.

12:00:15
<transcript>: Finally did it. And then last night, I can't sleep because I'm thinking about a new idea for that domain.

12:00:19
<transcript>: What's wrong with us.

12:00:29
<transcript>: So the second idea for Public ID is to make it sort of like a phone book for developers, if you will.

12:00:31
<transcript>: I think this one could be it.

12:00:34
<transcript>: Yeah.

12:00:51
<transcript>: Software developers.

12:01:02
<transcript>: Offer developers have the weirdest profession in the world.

12:01:36
<transcript>: Why do we all have to have a side project at all times.

12:01:48
<transcript>: Like imaginative doctors got home and they all just tried to cure cancer or every lawyer clocks off, goes home and works on some personal little class action lawsuits. Side project That's gonna make it big.

12:01:59
<transcript>: I've spent the better part of the last year working on a side project called Public dev. It was like a personal site builder for developers.

12:01:59
<transcript>: i finally

12:02:01
<transcript>: I finally after.

12:02:01
<transcript>: so much

12:02:07
<transcript>: So much painful. Deliberation decided. I knew to sunset the project. I need to be done with it.

12:02:07
<transcript>: i worked

12:02:09
<transcript>: and there's

12:02:09
<transcript>: I worked on it for months.

12:02:11
<transcript>: And there's users out there.

12:02:11
<transcript>: sending me email

12:02:14
<transcript>: Sending me emails. I just need to be done with it.

12:02:14
<transcript>: finally

12:02:21
<transcript>: Finally made that decision. And last night, I can't sleep because I've got a new idea for that domain.

12:02:26
<transcript>: What's wrong with us.

12:02:31
<transcript>: So the second I.

12:02:33
<transcript>: Phone book for developers.

12:02:36
<transcript>: I think it could be big. This could be the one.

12:02:59
<transcript>: Programming is the strangest profession in the world.

12:02:59
<transcript>: why do we

12:03:03
<transcript>: Why do we all have to have a side project? What's the side projects anyway.

12:03:03
<transcript>: like

12:03:06
<transcript>: Like we all have something we're constantly doing.

12:03:06
<transcript>: on the side

12:03:11
<transcript>: On the side of our normal job that we're hoping is going to make it big someday.

12:03:20
<transcript>: I don't know. It's like imagine if every lawyer went home after work and we're worked on some personal little side project.

12:03:20
<transcript>: like big giant

12:03:27
<transcript>: Like big, giant class action lawsuits or something that was gonna make it big. And they were gonna retire. And.

12:03:27
<transcript>: or if every

12:03:47
<transcript>: Or if every doctor went home and like personally, tried to work on curing cancer, it's just it's. I don't know what to do with it. I spent the last year working on a side project, public dev. And after just a whole lot of painful deliberation, I've decided I need a sunset. It just need to be done with it. We're worked on it for months.

12:03:56
<transcript>: Just tossily feel guilty about it. So I finally decide I'm done with it. And last night I can't sleep because I've got a new idea for the domain.

12:04:00
<transcript>: What's wrong with us.

12:04:05
<transcript>: i think

12:04:05
<transcript>: So the new idea is like a foam book for developers.

12:04:07
<transcript>: I think this could be the one.

12:04:10
<transcript>: Could be it.

12:04:44
<transcript>: Programming is the strangest profession in the world.

12:04:44
<transcript>: why

12:04:47
<transcript>: Why do we all have side projects.

12:04:49
<transcript>: What's with side projects.

12:04:58
<transcript>: I've worked on a side project for the better part of the last year. Public dev. It's a site builder for devs to build their personal files.

12:05:06
<transcript>: And I put so much effort into it, but I haven't worked on it for months. It just makes me feel guilty, but I'm not working on it.

12:05:15
<transcript>: But it's like this thing that you hang on to it's this carrot. That like it's gonna be big. You're gonna just retire with this side project at some point.

12:05:20
<transcript>: so

12:05:20
<transcript>: I don't think other professions have this and it's so interesting to me.

12:05:30
<transcript>: So after a year, I've decided finally, I'm gonna sunset public dev. I'm gonna be done with this side project. It's time to just move on.

12:05:33
<transcript>: Stop pretending like I'm gonna get back to it.

12:05:33
<transcript>: and

12:05:34
<transcript>: And.

12:05:34
<transcript>: after

12:05:36
<transcript>: finally

12:05:36
<transcript>: After all of that.

12:05:41
<transcript>: Finally made a final decision and I can't sleep last night because I'm a new idea for the domain.

12:05:44
<transcript>: What's wrong with us.

12:05:51
<transcript>: So the new idea is it'll be like a phone book.

12:05:51
<transcript>: for develop

12:05:57
<transcript>: For developers. So you got all the developers. Listen, I think this one could be it. This could be a day. This could be the one.

12:06:25
<transcript>: Programming is the strangest profession in the world by far.

12:06:25
<transcript>: what's

12:06:29
<transcript>: What's with side projects? Why do we all have side projects.

12:06:40
<transcript>: They're just like they sit out there. They nagget you. You feel guilty when you neglect them. You get really into them for a while. They kind of become your main project. They're very distracting.

12:06:44
<transcript>: And all that we think maybe someday it'll hit it big, I guess.

12:06:57
<transcript>: I finally decided after a year of working on public Dev my latest side project, I just need to be done. I need to sunset it. I'm not gonna get back to it. It's been months I've worked on it.

12:07:12
<transcript>: Software development is the weirdest profession in the world.

12:07:16
<transcript>: What's the side projects? Why do we all have to have a side project.

12:07:16
<transcript>: and

12:07:20
<transcript>: And every time I finish a side project, or just give up.

12:07:20
<transcript>: i started

12:07:23
<transcript>: I started a new one. It's just inevitable.

12:07:28
<transcript>: it's

12:07:28
<transcript>: I guess it's like we think we're gonna make a big someday with that side project.

12:07:31
<transcript>: It's the next big thing.

12:07:43
<transcript>: Programming is the strangest profession in the world.

12:07:48
<transcript>: What's the side projects? Why do we all have side projects constantly.

12:07:48
<transcript>: we finish

12:07:52
<transcript>: it's just

12:07:52
<transcript>: We finish one side project. We have band in it, and we move on to the next.

12:07:58
<transcript>: It's just. It's a turnstile of ideas that we're constantly turning through. No.

12:08:09
<transcript>: Programming is the strangest profession in the world.

12:08:24
<transcript>: Programming is the strangest profession in history.

12:08:24
<transcript>: what's the side

12:08:27
<transcript>: What's the side projects? Why do we all have side projects.

12:08:27
<transcript>: i finished

12:08:37
<transcript>: I finished one side project or I get up on it and I immediately come up with a new one. Sometimes I have multiple side projects going on at one time. I guess we think.

12:08:37
<transcript>: that

12:08:46
<transcript>: That side project's gonna be the end it's gonna be the thing that we retire on? We get all that passive income? That sweet, sweet, passive income.

12:09:03
<transcript>: So I've worked on Public dev, my latest side project for over a year, I think. And I finally, finally, after much, much painful proliberation, decided that I'm gonna sunset it. I'm just done with it. It's not worth it out. I've worked on it for months.

12:09:07
<transcript>: I need to just kind of like, let the people that use it move on.

12:09:13
<transcript>: So I finally decide that. And then last night, I can't sleep because I have a new idea for the domain.

12:09:16
<transcript>: What's rolling with us.

12:09:24
<transcript>: So the new idea is like a yellow book, like a foam book for development.

12:09:27
<transcript>: It's like a directory of dead.

12:09:30
<transcript>: This one. This one could be it.

12:09:30
<transcript>: this could be the one

12:09:31
<transcript>: This could be the one.

12:09:49
<transcript>: Programming is the strangest profession in history.

12:09:49
<transcript>: what

12:09:53
<transcript>: What's with side projects? Why do we all have a side project at all times.

12:09:59
<transcript>: I've never not had a side project. Sometimes I have multiple side projects going on.

12:09:59
<transcript>: alongside my

12:10:00
<transcript>: Alongside my fulltime job.

12:10:06
<transcript>: I'm still part of the last year working on public Dev.

12:10:06
<transcript>: it's a personal

12:10:09
<transcript>: It's a personal site builder for developers.

12:10:09
<transcript>: and

12:10:13
<transcript>: deliber

12:10:13
<transcript>: And I finally decided after a whole lot of painful.

12:10:18
<transcript>: Deliberation that I just need to be done. I need to sunset the project and move on.

12:10:18
<transcript>: and

12:10:24
<transcript>: And that was yesterday. Last night. I can't sleep because I have a new idea for the domain.

12:10:28
<transcript>: What is wrong with us.

12:10:37
<transcript>: So the new idea is like a phone book for developers. So like a big directory of debts.

12:10:37
<transcript>: this one

12:10:39
<transcript>: This one could be it.

12:18:54
<transcript>: Programming is the strangest profession in history.

12:19:00
<transcript>: A doctor can't just go be a doctor. You got to go to school for.

12:19:09
<transcript>: Six, eight years, at least in the United States. And you got to get licenses. And they're really serious about who can be a doctor, right. Because.

12:19:09
<transcript>: we don't

12:19:12
<transcript>: We don't need anybody to get hurt.

12:19:12
<transcript>: we don't want

12:19:13
<transcript>: We don't want.

12:19:15
<transcript>: Somebody who's taken care of your health.

12:19:18
<transcript>: To not be.

12:19:18
<transcript>: fully

12:19:25
<transcript>: Fully checked out, right? So you want to be a doctor, you got to jump through a lot of hoops. You want to write the software.

12:19:25
<transcript>: that runs

12:19:27
<transcript>: That runs the mri machine.

12:19:34
<transcript>: No credentials. Don't have to have a thing.

12:19:42
<transcript>: Fizzbiz. Can you solve fismiz on a whiteboard? You're in.

12:19:42
<transcript>: you'll

12:19:46
<transcript>: You'll want to be an airline pilot? There's a lot of regulations involved.

12:19:46
<transcript>: like you don't

12:19:51
<transcript>: Like you don't just hop in a plane. You get hundreds and hundreds of hours.

12:19:51
<transcript>: my brothers

12:19:56
<transcript>: My brothers a pilot. He had to build up hundreds and hundreds of hours.

12:20:00
<transcript>: In order to get a commercial airline job.

12:20:05
<transcript>: Hundreds and hundreds of hours flying a plane in order to get a job as an airline pilot.

12:20:05
<transcript>: in order

12:20:08
<transcript>: In order to get a job as a commercial pilot.

12:20:17
<transcript>: And you want to write, but you want to write the software that actually flies the plane. You want to write the autopilot systems that actually flat the plane.

12:20:20
<transcript>: Do you live in Silicon Valley.

12:20:23
<transcript>: No One at Boeing.

12:20:23
<transcript>: got

12:20:26
<transcript>: Got you self a job got yourself job.

12:20:41
<transcript>: Is the strangest job.

12:20:54
<transcript>: Programming is the strangest profession in history.

12:20:57
<transcript>: Most jobs.

12:21:06
<transcript>: There's some sort of barrier you've got to reach in order to be that thing, right? If you want to be a doctor.

12:21:26
<transcript>: you have to

12:21:26
<transcript>: You don't just go in and start a medicine practice. You don't just go in and start your own practice. You don't just, like, run out of space, start your own practice and start seeing patients, right? You got to go to school for six, eight years. You've got to be accredited and licensed and residency and all of these Hoops.

12:21:35
<transcript>: You have to jump through because our health is important. We don't want anybody to just be able to walk in and start prescribing medicaid medications or whatever.

12:21:42
<transcript>: But you want to write the software that, like runs on an mri machine.

12:21:42
<transcript>: i don't know can

12:21:45
<transcript>: I don't know. Can you solve fizzbiz on a whiteboard.

12:21:55
<transcript>: Or let's say you want to be a pilot. You want to fly 250 people.

12:21:55
<transcript>: in a little metal

12:21:58
<transcript>: In a little metal tube at 40 0ft.

12:21:58
<transcript>: there's some paperwork

12:22:02
<transcript>: There's some paperwork, there's some some things you're gonna have to do.

12:22:06
<transcript>: In order to to keep that license.

12:22:12
<transcript>: But you want to write the autopilot software that runs on a Boeing 737.

12:22:15
<transcript>: I don't know. Do you live in Silicon Valley.

12:22:15
<transcript>: did you graduate from

12:22:17
<transcript>: Did you graduate from Stanford? Cool.

12:22:19
<transcript>: You're in.

12:22:29
<transcript>: I don't know. Are you willing to come into the office.

12:22:34
<transcript>: Let's see your github contributions.

12:22:54
<transcript>: Programming is the strangest profession in history.

12:22:54
<transcript>: if you want to be

12:22:57
<transcript>: If you want to be a doctor, you don't just go rin out of space.

12:22:57
<transcript>: start

12:22:59
<transcript>: you have to go through

12:22:59
<transcript>: Start practicing medicine.

12:23:11
<transcript>: it could be dangerous

12:23:11
<transcript>: You have to go through years of school and residency and certifications and licenses. There's a lot of Hoops because we don't with just anybody being able to go in and start writing prescriptions.

12:23:12
<transcript>: It could be dangerous.

12:23:12
<transcript>: but

12:23:16
<transcript>: But you want to write the software that runs on an mri machine.

12:23:19
<transcript>: Can you solve physics on a chalkboard.

12:23:26
<transcript>: Or let's say you want to be a pilot. You want to fly 250 people.

12:23:26
<transcript>: in a little

12:23:28
<transcript>: In a little metal tube.

12:23:31
<transcript>: we've

12:23:31
<transcript>: 40,000ft in the air.

12:23:34
<transcript>: We've got some serious Hoops.

12:23:41
<transcript>: We've got a lot of regulations in place to make sure. Not just anybody can do that. My brother is a commercial airline pilot. He had to get hundreds of hundreds of hours.

12:23:41
<transcript>: flying

12:23:43
<transcript>: Flying A plane.

12:23:48
<transcript>: To get his first commercial. To get his first job as a commercial pilot.

12:23:54
<transcript>: But do you want to write the software that can.

12:23:54
<transcript>: you want to

12:23:58
<transcript>: You want to write the autopilot systems that control the actual plane.

12:24:06
<transcript>: Are you willing to come into the office.

12:24:06
<transcript>: let's

12:24:10
<transcript>: Let's see your github contributions. And are you willing to come into the office.

12:24:12
<transcript>: Hired.

12:24:36
<transcript>: Programming is the strangest profession in history.

12:24:36
<transcript>: if

12:24:42

<transcript>: if you want

12:25:01

12:25:20
<transcript>: Accreditation residency. You have to maintain a license. We don't want just anybody being able to go in and start writing prescriptions, right? It's dangerous. We got to make sure everybody's safe. But if you want to write the software that runs on an mri machine, I don't know. Can you solve fizbiz on a chalkboard.

12:25:30
<transcript>: Or let's say you want to be a pilot. My brother is a commercial airline pilot. He had gets hundreds and hundreds of hours flying a plane before he got his first job as a commercial pilot.

12:25:34
<transcript>: It's not very. It makes sense. Right.

12:25:41
<transcript>: But you want to write the software that you want to write the autopilot systems.

12:25:46
<transcript>: But do you want to program the autopilot systems that actually fly the plane.
