<transcript>: I've been filming a lot of YouTube videos. I'm going to be releasing two YouTube videos a week for the rest of the year. That's my commitment to you all. I guess that doesn't really help you all. You don't care. You just want to watch me stream, but I'm doing it.

00:12:17
<transcript>: two week

00:12:23
<transcript>: Two week, I recorded one this morning, even. And then I started streaming. That's a big step for me because.

00:12:23
<transcript>: normally

00:12:28
<transcript>: Normally I either do YouTube or I stream in a day. I can't seem to do both today. Did both.

00:12:28
<transcript>: all it takes is

00:12:33
<transcript>: All it takes is hiring an editor. I can down, just send my videos to Flip and know that.

00:12:33
<transcript>: they'll be edited

00:12:35
<transcript>: They'll be edited.

00:12:35
<transcript>: feels good

00:12:36
<transcript>: Feels good.

00:12:36
<transcript>: but yeah

00:12:44
<transcript>: But, yeah, I'm going to be doing two, and we're doing two episodes of our podcast a week. We're going to record one today, doing lots of things. I'm becoming a full time content creator.

00:12:44
<transcript>: except nobody

airtonzanon: PHP is Good, but why laravel? D:

00:13:36
<transcript>: Dax, is that the Tweet? Is that the one with the guy from Red Bull.

00:13:51
<transcript>: Totos here. Laravel, are you going to use liveware? Yes, I believe we will be using livewire. I'm just not ready to jump back into the javascript frameworks. I know inertia is good. From what I hear, good.

00:13:56
<transcript>: But my goal is not to use nextjs again or react or view or anything.

00:13:56
<transcript>: i just want to

outofbounds_music: Found out you also stream through your YouTube videos and went to look up your Twitch just when you were starting the stream Perfect timing haha

00:14:07
<transcript>: Write this side project does not require a lot of client side interactivity a little bit, not a lot. I think it's good for liveware. We'll talk about it.

00:14:11
<transcript>: Kazakh got Archangel in the house. Archangel.

00:14:11
<transcript>: who

00:14:14

00:14:53
<transcript>: This very minute.

00:14:56
<transcript>: So we're going to be working on a side project today.

00:14:58
rodneypk: I haven't used PHP since the 5.x days.

00:15:03
<transcript>: And I have too many things going on, but I'm working on a side project. I literally recorded a video on for YouTube this morning.

00:15:03
<transcript>: that's going to be titled

00:15:07
<transcript>: That's going to be titled something like Don't Start Side projects.

00:15:21
<transcript>: It's so funny how this stuff it comes in waves, like topics become like, they the reason I want to record a video about all my mistakes with side projects is that I have a new side project. And it's like, I have to talk about this.

00:15:21
<transcript>: crispian

00:15:24

00:15:39
dmmulroy: (I write ocaml, btw)

00:15:40
<transcript>: Lewis, thank you for the follows. So we're going to work on a little side project. It's something I need because I have too much going on. And this side project is just for me and dax, it's just the thing that's going to help us manage our podcast marketing. We're going to automate some stuff.

00:15:40
<transcript>: that's

00:15:43
<transcript>: That's too much time investment at the moment.

00:15:47
<transcript>: So, yeah, we're going to work on it. It's going to be built in laravel.

00:15:47
<transcript>: i'm going to need

00:15:53
rodneypk: Blank page for me.

00:15:57
dmmulroy: ty

00:15:58
thdxr: if it’s automated why does it need a UI

00:15:58
<transcript>: I'm going to need you find people who probably know laravel in my chat to help me go faster because that's what happens when you stream on twitch. People help you go faster because they know how to use the thing more than you do.

00:16:00
thdxr: HMMM?

00:16:05
<transcript>: That's the wii Sport sound effect? No, Julian, julian's. Here. It's not.

00:16:05
<transcript>: all of the sound

00:16:09
fransverwoester: always ready to help!

00:16:13
<transcript>: All of the sound effects on the stream are from breakmaster cylinder and all the music. I mean, not the music we're listening to right now, but all of the theme music.

00:16:13
<transcript>: during break

00:16:26
<transcript>: During breaks and stuff. Love my hat. Oh, yeah. Dex is sweet. Archangel is here. Who's Archangel? Kassick. Who's that? I didn't see Archangel. Lame. Is he going for a lambo? Yeah.

00:16:35
<transcript>: Funny. If they made an electric Lambo, I would probably buy a Lambo just for the memes. Like, literally. Just so I could be like.

00:16:40
<transcript>: Lambo started using php. Look at it in my garage.

00:16:40
<transcript>: i mean

00:16:45
<transcript>: I mean, I wouldn't do it just for the memes. I would do it because it'd be really cool to have an electric Lambo.

00:16:49
thdxr: arcangel is hereeee

00:16:53
aj_stuyvenberg: the ideal family vehicle

00:17:02
<transcript>: We've driven electric. This is going to sound so pretentious. We've driven electric for ten years, just like we've been plant based for ten years. So I know think at this point, we're driving a car that we have to go to the gas station. I just can't imagine pulling up to a gas station in the ozarks, in a Lambo.

00:17:05
<transcript>: What would that be like.

00:17:06
caiocodes: @danielhe4rt at twitch is a great php dev, he is now a devRel at ScyllaDB

00:17:11
sockthedev: do your neighbours find you insufferable?

00:17:13
<transcript>: I wonder if Taylor goes to gas stations or does he buy gasoline in bulk and have it shipped to him or something? I just can't imagine.

00:17:13
<transcript>: he lives

00:17:17
unrulyhotfixer: the revuelto is electric i think

00:17:18
<transcript>: He lives in the midwest like I do can't imagine rolling up to one of these.

00:19:03
lilfreezi: theres that dev that people call adam but i call good lookin

00:19:04
<transcript>: Podcast that we're going to record right after this stream on dax's stream. Just a bunch of what you want is happening right now. I was going to learn ocaml because of tease, but I guess it won't grant me.

00:19:04
<transcript>: a lambo

00:19:13
<transcript>: A Lambo as fast as php in larryville no ocammel and htmx. I'm still excited about that, by the way, tj, if you're still here, I'm still very excited.

00:19:13
<transcript>: the laravel

00:19:20
<transcript>: The laravel did not. There's plenty of love to go around. It just multiplies. But love multiplies. It doesn't subtract.

00:19:20
<transcript>: okay

00:19:25
<transcript>: Okay, my interest in other technologies just makes me more interested in other technologies.

00:19:25

00:20:01
<transcript>: Hello, Chow codes. Good morning, afternoon, airton. Welcome to Chat. Php is good, but why laravel? If I'm going to write PHP, it's going to be larabel. Like, if you're going to write PHP, might as well be in the really productive framework known as laravel. Right.

00:20:02
lkfen: africa too

00:20:06
charafmrah: #IstanbulGang

00:20:12
<transcript>: Can't imagine why I wouldn't. If you're going to watch a twitch streamer, you might as well watch one that you might win a macbook right. If you're going to write php, you might as well.

00:20:12
<transcript>: write larave

00:20:12
dmdboi: @sockthedev what neighbours? He bought the surrounding plots LUL

00:20:15
<transcript>: Write laravel, and have a chance at a Lambo.

00:20:15
<transcript>: found out

00:20:26
<transcript>: Found out you also stream through your YouTube videos and when to look up your Twitch just when you're starting the stream. Perfect timing. I love that that's happened before. I think I love that. That's so cool. Like, oh, this person has a Twitch, and then they just went live.

00:20:34
tayloreddev: There are better choices for PHP imo

00:20:37
<transcript>: It makes sense. Some people find me and I'm not streaming that's the people that are 18 hours ago they followed me and I don't know if they'll ever see me because they may not watch twitch when I'm on.

00:20:42
julianfbeck: i know that your startup is in phoenix but have you played with phoenix and liveview yet?

unrulyhotfixer: tall stack is tailwind alpine laravel and livewire

00:21:20
<transcript>: Yeah. Is there like eight point something now? Php. What is it on? We'll find out we're all learning together here. Can someone tell me if this link is down? Can tell if my work vpn is being wonky or not. I'm guessing somebody checked that for him. Do I need to check it? If it's automated, why does it need a UI.

00:21:20
<transcript>: it might not need

00:21:25
<transcript>: It might not need a ui. It might just be some scripts. We'll write some PHP scripts.

<transcript>: Airton xanon thank you for the follow. Here's a tip. You could just do it. You won't make any money. But if you're in a situation.

00:23:25
thdxr: he still hasn’t acknowledged arcangel

00:23:29
<transcript>: Where you don't need money like you live with your parents or you're otherwise supported and you don't need an income.

00:23:29
<transcript>: then

00:23:34
<transcript>: Then you immediately just start doing it full time because nobody can stop you.

00:23:34
<transcript>: the

00:23:39
<transcript>: The trick is to find a way to have a sustainable situation.

00:23:39
<transcript>: where you can

00:23:42
<transcript>: Where you can chase your dream.

00:23:44
rodneypk: Poor arcangel.

00:23:44
<transcript>: For me.

00:23:44
<transcript>: it worked

00:23:45
donttickle: what's the side project? :O

00:23:59
<transcript>: It worked in a way where I just got paid to learn a lot. I got an early job where somebody trusted me as a new software developer, and I was able to do a lot of learning on the job. But that doesn't happen for everyone. So if there's other ways, if you can save up some money.

00:23:59
<transcript>: at

00:24:03
<transcript>: At a different job. I don't even know if that's what you're asking.

00:24:04
<transcript>: You might be like.

00:24:04
<transcript>: systems engineer

00:24:14
<transcript>: Systems engineer. And you're like, how do I move into a product role? And then I feel like an idiot. But I just went into that big thing. We'll see, we'll see what you meant.

00:24:18
<transcript>: Migos. Php is like the Johnson Johnson vaccine. Can't complain it works.

00:24:20
<transcript>: That's funny.

00:24:20
<transcript>: little freez

00:24:24
<transcript>: Little freezies here. There's that Dev that people call Adam. But I call good looking.

00:24:32
<transcript>: Little freezey. I love it. Good. Grandpa. You're from Ohio. Did I know that? Good, grandpa.

00:24:36
<transcript>: You're in my time zone? No. Eastern. Are you Eastern.

00:24:36
<transcript>: massachusetts

00:24:39
<transcript>: Massachusetts. Okay, we got a bunch of east coasters.

00:24:39
<transcript>: africa

00:24:41
goodgrandpaa: I think so! :) Eastern time :)

00:24:45
<transcript>: Africa, Too. Lk. Finn, welcome to Chat. Got People in Africa. Istanbul.

00:24:48
<transcript>: What neighbors. He bought the surrounding plots.

00:24:48
<transcript>: how

00:24:51
<transcript>: How is that known? Did I say that on stream.

00:24:51
<transcript>: diamond

00:24:57
aj_stuyvenberg: lol yeah

00:25:07
<transcript>: Diamond. Did I say that once? Did I say that one side of us isn't a lot. It's just common ground in the neighborhood, but it might as well be our lot because it's just a big open corner. And then we bought the other lot next to us. So we do have a little bit of a buffer, but not like a ton of buffer.

00:25:07
<transcript>: we didn't

00:25:14
dmdboi: You did say that

00:25:14
<transcript>: We didn't buy up half the neighborhood. We just have a little bit of, like we set on, like, three acres, and nobody can touch us.

00:25:14
<transcript>: so

00:25:15
msmazaya: Yes I meant that, so youre saying that I should be working a full time job to fulfill my need and work on my product on my free time?

00:25:17
dmdboi: I also went through your trash

00:25:20
goodgrandpaa: Be real, do you own your neighborhood? Kappa

00:25:24
<transcript>: So they don't think I'm insufferable, though. Why would they think I'm insufferable? Do you think I'm insufferable? Taylor is here? There are better choices for php, in my opinion. Oh, really better than laravel.

00:25:24
<transcript>: say more

00:25:26
<transcript>: Say more words.

00:25:26
<transcript>: i'm

00:25:34
nicolahristov: cake cake

00:25:34
<transcript>: I'm very sold on laravel, but I'd like to hear your argument. I know that you're starting up in Phoenix, but have you played with Phoenix in Live View yet.

00:25:34
<transcript>: no

00:25:38
<transcript>: No, I don't think we use Live View in our Phoenix app.

00:25:40
dmmulroy: Adams house: https://twitter.com/pubity/status/1655502332820602882

00:25:42
h4msterbo1: sup dev boi

00:25:58
<transcript>: I don't think because it's a react. We have like a React app embedded in this Phoenix app, so I don't think we're using Live View, but I'm curious about Live View. Tall Sack is tailwind alpine, laravel, and Livewear alpine. That's Caleb, right. Caleb porzio. I first learned of Caleb before I ever knew anything about PHP.

00:25:58
<transcript>: now i know

00:25:59
greemwahr: What make and model is ur headphone?

00:26:00
charafmrah: Symfony with Doctrine maybe?

00:26:01
goodgrandpaa: @dmmulroy LUL grandpa from Up!

00:26:04
william_jacob: Laravel problably has the best devex of all php frameworks

00:26:06
msmazaya: Oh yea, is phoenix good? Would you recommend it or do you regret using it?

00:26:07
<transcript>: Now I know so much about PHP. But before I was a php expert, I knew of caleb because I used vs. Code, and he had a make vs. Code. Awesome.

00:26:07
<transcript>: course

00:26:16
<transcript>: Course. I guess you call it. Was it a course or like I don't know. It was like an info product of some sort. And I bought it and it made my vs. Code awesome. It was really good.

00:26:16
<transcript>: i liked

00:26:20
thdxr: shut up and code

00:26:31
unrulyhotfixer: yes Caleb made Alpine and Livewire

00:26:32
dmdboi: @dmmulroy LUL

00:26:36
chrispian: Livewire and Alpine are  both from Caleb, right?

00:26:37
<transcript>: I liked caleb in that little course. And then I learned recently he's in this community, and he did the alpine thing, right? Okay. Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling. How behind it. I may just going to jump ahead. I'm just going to jump all the way to the bottom. Shut up. And Code dax says that. So let's do it. Let's shut up. And Code caleb made alpine and livewire. I just skipped so many message.

00:26:37
<transcript>: messages and

00:26:39
<transcript>: Messages. And I feel so bad about it.

00:26:39
<transcript>: but

00:26:44
<transcript>: But as I scroll, I don't know. I probably should just skip them.

00:26:44
<transcript>: there's some

00:26:47
<transcript>: There's some welcomes to chats, though kelg.

00:29:13

thdxr: lookup franz ferdinand WW1

<transcript>: Franz ferdinand, what are you talking about? Dax, you're making that up. This isn't just setting stream. It's true.

00:29:57
aj_stuyvenberg: you're thinking of Marie-Louise von Franz, the Swiss Freudian psychologist

00:29:59
theslowdev: If you are trying to do something with PHP and laravel you should check this library: https://turbo-laravel.com/docs/1.x/installation

00:30:03
<transcript>: No, somebody tell me who is the prominent person? World War One. What? Van der hurton. This freak. Vanderherton. That's it. That's it. That's totally going to be it.

00:30:10
<transcript>: Yes. Freak. Dev. That's awesome. I need to see his profile picture to confirm. I need it.

00:30:10
<transcript>: yes

00:30:15
theslowdev: This guy ported the turbolinks from rails to laravel

theslowdev: it is awesome

00:30:19
dnbull: Hi ADAM

00:30:23
<transcript>: Yes. That's him. That's the one when I saw somebody's name was franz. Something. I'm sorry. Friends. You're here. And I'm sorry I bought your name, but I thought you were this person. But you're not. Okay. Hi. Dmbo.

00:30:23
<transcript>: okay here

00:30:36
robinmalfait: Freek and his team make a lot of Laravel packages. https://spatie.be

00:30:38
sj_se: @adamdotdev dm sent on here

00:30:39
<transcript>: Okay, here we go. Let's get to work. We got stuff to do. If you're trying to do something with php and laravel, you should check this library turbo. So I do need the community's help on all the hip things I should be using because there's so many things. There's so many things.

00:30:42
airtonzanon: https://twitter.com/freekmurze <- Freek's twitter

00:30:50
sj_se: dont dox me

00:30:50
wolfyjd: RoadRunner + Spiral if you want to do some crazy things

00:30:50
thdxr: franz ferdinand

00:30:50
<transcript>: What is the one that I just saw that everyone was like, oh, it's so good. It's like a third party thing. It's like a component library. Maybe I forget what it's called. Okay, first thing we got to do is actually.

00:30:53
chrispian: Filament?

00:30:54
charafmrah: @TayloredDev I heard that too

00:31:04
<transcript>: We're not actually using laravel to start. I'm sorry we're not using php or laravel. Such a clickbait. We're going to get to filament. Thank you, Christian. Yeah, filament. Somebody told me to use filament. Why do you keep saying franz ferdinand zax? What is going on.

00:31:06
airtonzanon: He runs the Fullstack Benelux conference

00:31:13
<transcript>: Thank you so much. Sj. I can't wait to have our one on one call. How crazy somebody finally redeemed it. It's been out there for months.

00:31:13
<transcript>: and

00:31:13
unrulyhotfixer: yeah filament is good!

00:31:27
<transcript>: And someone finally redeemed it. Me and sj are going to have a one on one call and I can't wait. Filament is good. Okay, good to know. So first thing we have to do is prove out the concept. I haven't even told you what the project is. So the project is called peasy.

00:31:27
<transcript>: peasy

00:31:35
<transcript>: Peasy like peasy FM. And the point is, Me and dax, we record a podcast twice a week now.

00:31:35
<transcript>: and

00:31:37
<transcript>: And.

00:31:37
<transcript>: it's our two

00:31:39
m4tty_d: easy peasy

00:31:42
<transcript>: It's our two heads. Our two talking heads. We have separate video files for each.

00:31:42
<transcript>: okay

00:31:45
<transcript>: Okay. And we need to turn them into.

00:31:47
<transcript>: Let's just do this.

00:31:47
<transcript>: we need to turn

00:31:49
<transcript>: We need to turn them into.

00:31:50
outofbounds_music: All that PHP tweetin makes me want to try PHP myself

00:31:54
<transcript>: One of these and you're not going to hear the audio, but you can get the idea.

00:31:58
mattgoslow: lemon squeezy

00:31:59
<transcript>: Oh, it's so loud, so loud.

00:32:07
<transcript>: How do I mute it? So it needs to do this. It needs to cut back and forth between our faces as we're talking. So we have two video files.

00:32:07
<transcript>: i want to find

00:32:17
wolfyjd: whisper.cpp also runs wonderfully on any device for speech to text

00:32:21
<transcript>: I want to find in that 30 minutes video file, I want to find the most interesting 1 minute clips. Okay. Two or three of them. And I want it to just automatically create this thing. It's a cut between our two faces. It's got captions automatically.

00:32:21
<transcript>: i want to do

00:32:23
<transcript>: I want to do it all. Okay.

00:32:23
<transcript>: i want to

00:32:33
mehulsharmamat: nice!

00:32:34
dmdboi: Tbh why would you want to cut to Dax?

00:32:38
julianfbeck: nice

00:32:38
<transcript>: I want to drop our two video files in it, and I want to spit out interesting clips so I can pump on social. Okay. Lemon squeezy. Exactly. Easy peasy, whisper cpp also runs wonderfully on any device for speech to text. So I was planning on using Mayhools. Here.

00:32:38
<transcript>: to be

00:32:40
canslaughter: cool

00:32:42
<transcript>: To be honest, why would you want to cut the decks.

00:32:44
mehulsharmamat: you're gonna use php for it?

00:32:44
dmdboi: Just let him talk but show some subway surfer video instead

00:32:51
charafmrah: There's a similar product called "Opus Clip" that does this

00:33:02
<transcript>: I love it so much. Oh, that was a good one. A good dax burn. I'm here for it. So here's how we're going to do this. Turbo. Laraville, I got to look into that. So we're going to use the whisper api from openai because I hear it's the best speech text. I've used so many of them, but I hear it's the best. Yes. Mayhew we're going to use larave.

00:33:02
<transcript>: laravel

00:33:12
airtonzanon: damn, that's a CLEAN desk!

00:33:14
mattgoslow: It's just for us to all stare at that wonderful fringe

00:33:16
<transcript>: Laravel, we're going to build this in laravel because it's amazing. And I'll have half the features already built. Well, I'll have all the user management stuff already built. I might even have teams and organizations just because laravel jetpack has it. It's just built in. I don't have to build it.

00:33:19
<transcript>: So here's the problem, though.

00:33:19
<transcript>: the main problem

00:33:23
<transcript>: The main problem of this app is not all the ffmpeg stuff.

00:33:23
<transcript>: that's a thing

00:33:30
mehulsharmamat: let's see if you can convince me to do laravel

00:33:32
lesabotsy: Is everything Laravel free?

00:33:33
<transcript>: That's a thing like we're going to have to cut up the video. We're going to have to do face detection to center the frames because I'm not centered in my frame. I'm not sure if dax is on his. If you can't just take the.

00:33:33
<transcript>: middle you can't just

00:33:33
m4tty_d: writing Laravel while eating a Larabar

00:33:38
<transcript>: Middle. You can't just 16, nine by 16. It in the middle and expect it to have our faces. We're going to have to actually.

00:33:47
<transcript>: Find the phase in the frames and kind of like center it on the best average position of face. Right. So that's a little problem. Not a big deal. Very.

00:33:47
<transcript>: easy prov

00:33:48
mehulsharmamat: i seriously cant set stuff up with AWS Literally calling a friend who works on amazon to fix my dumbness

00:33:56
<transcript>: Easy, proven stuff to do. Not very easy, but there's proven solutions. I don't have to do anything. I just have to use the right tools. The thing that's tricky about this is.

00:33:56
<transcript>: finding

00:34:17
<transcript>: Finding the right moments. So if you have a 30 minutes recording, how do you find the best, the three best minutes in that 30 minutes recording. There's a lot of different ways we could go with this. My first assumption is that AI is going to solve all my problems. So my first assumption is or my first guess. My first hypothesis, if you will, is.

00:34:17
<transcript>: we

00:34:19
<transcript>: We transcribe the whole thing.

00:34:22
<transcript>: I guess the two things. The two videos.

00:34:22
<transcript>: we inter

00:34:24
<transcript>: We interleave those transcriptions together.

00:34:24
<transcript>: speaker

00:34:25
thdxr: your friend likely is doing it wrong also

00:34:26
nefine_: @Lesabotsy they have deploy stuff that you can use to, that's not free, but it's really convenient, the rest yes, it's like rails or any FE framework

00:34:30
<transcript>: Speaker to speaker. Right. So we have one big transcription of the whole session. And we say, Hey.

00:34:30
<transcript>: gpt

00:34:32
thdxr: just ask me

00:34:40
<transcript>: Gpt four. Tell me what are the most interesting 1 minute clips? Because I'm assuming whisper gives us output. Let's just see I'm assuming it gives us timestamps. Oh, no, if it doesn't, that's bad.

00:34:40
<transcript>: if it

00:34:43
<transcript>: If it doesn't want to use something else.

00:34:43
bishopdev: yes

00:34:46
<transcript>: Where's the response.

00:34:48
bishopdev: there's a node api to whisper as well

00:34:49
<transcript>: Json with.

00:34:53
wolfyjd: cpp does provide timings :)

00:34:54
<transcript>: Prompting overview. Is that what the response looks like.

00:34:54
p1xl: It does not provide timestamps

00:34:55
mehulsharmamat: if you dont get SRT assemblyai generates srt @adamdotdev

00:35:02
<transcript>: Is that it CPP does provide time, yet most of them do node API to whisper as well. Okay.

00:35:02
<transcript>: they do have

00:35:12
<transcript>: They do have deploy stuff your friend likely is doing it wrong. Also, what are you talking about? I seriously can't set stuff up with avis, literally calling a friend who works on Amazon to fix my dumbness.

00:35:18

00:40:45
<transcript>: We were a pre product, pre revenue, pre everything.

00:40:52
<transcript>: Or pre product. We had a product and some people really excited about our product. We'd raise $10 million from Disney and Google.

00:40:52
<transcript>: but

00:40:59
<transcript>: But we were going in looking for a $20 million raise, our Series B, and I don't remember what valuation.

00:40:59
<transcript>: but we were looking

00:41:03
<transcript>: But we were looking to raise $20 million. We had no idea how we would ever make money.

00:41:03
<transcript>: had not made

00:41:11
thdxr: tomorrow.fm hosts are successful investors

00:41:15
<transcript>: Had not made a dollar yet, and it was just me and my co founder being like, hey, your light speed. You should give us a lot of money. That's what you do, right? And they're like, no, we don't. Actually, you have to actually have a business. And it did not go well.

00:41:15
<transcript>: now at the same

00:41:20
<transcript>: Now at the same time, right after that, we pitched Andreessen.

00:41:40
<transcript>: And also didn't go well. That one was great, though his name is Frank. He's an AI person there at andreessen horowitz. I don't know if he's still there, but this has been four or five years ago. We walked in there the Sand Hill Road. We were late because we couldn't find it. It's like so many buildings in one little spot. And we're trying to find the andreessen office, and we finally get there. He's kind of annoyed that we're 20 minutes.

00:41:40
<transcript>: late

00:41:45
<transcript>: Late. We're sweating because we've been out walking around so fast, trying to find it.

00:41:45
<transcript>: we

00:41:57
<transcript>: We sit down and we pitch it. And it was like within a week of the light speed pitch. So similar story had no dollars to our name. No money we were making had raised a bunch of money. Still no plans to make money.

00:42:02
<transcript>: But we walk in, we show them some valid stuff we've been working on. And it was very clear.

00:42:02
<transcript>: like in the first

00:42:08
<transcript>: Like in the first ten minutes of the meeting. This guy was not interested. Frank was not having it. Not one bit.

00:42:09
adjectiveallison: Yo adam. I heard you got a personality for the first time? I've been looking for one. Do you have any advice on how you found it?

00:42:13
<transcript>: And at that point, we had done enough pitches.

00:42:31
trivenge: 1517 fund? @thdxr  not inviting danielle strachman NotLikeThis

00:42:33
<transcript>: Where I realized we're going to get nothing out of this, and we're going to walk out defeated. Or now that I know he's definitely not interested. I could just be totally honest with him and be like, Listen, I know you're not going to invest. It's very clear that you're not interested, but could you just give us some honest feedback? We'll never see each other again? It's fine. Just give me, like, Honestly, what do you think about this situation? Should we even be.

00:42:33
<transcript>: raising

00:42:37
<transcript>: Raising like, tell us what you really think, and he gave me some really good advice.

00:42:37
<transcript>: and really honest

00:42:39
trivenge: good morning everyone

00:42:42
<transcript>: And really honest, like there's no way you're raising $20 million if you do.

00:42:47
<transcript>: Then what he said was because we actually had someone that was interested in leading the round.

00:42:47
<transcript>: it was not a big

00:42:49
trivenge: oh shit, adam, im diggin the hair this morning

00:42:50
trivenge: SeemsGood

00:42:53
<transcript>: It was not a big brand name, but we had somebody. And we were just kind of pitching the big names.

00:42:53
<transcript>: so

00:43:00
<transcript>: So I told him I was like, Well, we actually have someone that's willing to lead this round. And he said, God bless America.

00:43:00
<transcript>: and he walked

00:43:01
<transcript>: And he walked out.

00:43:06
<transcript>: So good, he gave us some really good advice, though. I mean, he was very honest.

00:43:06
<transcript>: once i just

00:43:12
<transcript>: Once, I just dropped the whole facade of, like, we're trying to sell you. Clearly, it's not going to happen. So give us real advice.

00:43:19
<transcript>: Anyway, he was right. We shouldn't have raised $20 million. We didn't have any way to use that $20 million and make money.

00:43:23
<transcript>: Okay. I just realized I've been ignoring chat.

00:43:28
<transcript>: You seriously invest into things you know, Mayhew I always think I'm going to.

00:50:42
<transcript>: lesa

00:50:45
<transcript>: Lesa. I have less advice.

00:50:48
<transcript>: On fundraising than maybe I should.

00:51:04
<transcript>: For someone who's raised a lot of money and been in a lot of those pitches. I did not lead our fundraising efforts. That was my co founder. So I feel like my advice is pretty shallow and I don't know what investors actually want. Here's what I will say.

00:51:04
<transcript>: we pitched

00:51:09
<transcript>: We pitched a lot of investors, like a lot for all of our rounds.

00:51:15
trivenge: if you look really closely, dax has microscopic hairs on his head SeemsGood  @smilingbig

00:51:18
<transcript>: Like, way more than we actually got to invest. So the hit rate was low, and that might be universal. Maybe that's for everybody.

00:51:24
<transcript>: I don't know, but that's the one advice I can give you is like you're going to have to pitch it a lot. Probably.

01:02:23
dmdboi: Bart prank calls are my favourite

01:02:26
<transcript>: If so, that would be what you call hate following.

01:02:28
trivenge: theres money in programming still?

01:02:33
goodgrandpaa: We had to manually raid them LUL

01:02:35

cult_hero: Hey Adam - I’ve noticed that recruiters aren’t beating down the door on linkedin as they were a year ago - do you feel like this is uniform across the tech industry or focused on specific developers / roles?

01:02:42
<transcript>: How was my inflection? It didn't really sound like the words, right.

01:02:44

warrenbuffering: ayyyy I wokkin eeeearrrr

01:03:34
<transcript>: And I needed something new. And I know all these people from the Larry Booking community. They're all on Twitter. We bump into them all the time. We had Aaron on the podcast on Tuesday. We bumped into them all the time. They seem so happy, so drama free. And I finally just tried it. And I was going to make a YouTube video. So I made a YouTube video. It'll be out soon.

01:03:39
<transcript>: Of just like a javascript developer's first impressions of larabelle I didn't know I was going to fall in love.

01:03:39

01:03:40
trivenge: junior devs are struggling, too many devs now @cult_hero

01:03:45
<transcript>: I just thought I'm going to record my first exposure to it. I'm going to do, like, the starter project. I'm going to get started and see what happens.

01:03:45
<transcript>: and

01:03:46
thdxr: you're not a fucking free agent

01:03:52
<transcript>: And I fell in love. It's amazing. I just can't believe how much functionality on the starter project, how good the docks are. All of it.

01:03:52
<transcript>: so

01:03:53
smilingbig: LUL

01:04:00
trivenge: clear data on this as well. far too many people at the junior level. not enough good programmers at the upper level though

01:04:01
<transcript>: So I'm still in the very early stage where I'm just enamored. I have not gotten to the part where, oh, I don't actually like php. I'm sure I'll get there. I'm not there yet.

01:04:02
smilingbig: thdxr <3

01:04:07
<transcript>: Bishop going to have the money rolling. And now leave my wife buy a porsche. Oh, no, this just went dark.

01:04:09
cult_hero: @insanitylater hopefully

01:04:13
thdxr: can you link me to the verify thing again

01:04:15
trivenge: basically, if you are a dev now, you made it. enjoy

01:04:16
<transcript>: Average day on twitch. Thanks for the Bits XXX petri.

adjectiveallison: @thdxr youtube.com/verify

01:04:27
<transcript>: Okay. How? Adam? How. What did I do? Oh, that's when I said that I can't believe I've never seen that one. Okay.

01:04:32
<transcript>: I'm naive. I see somebody write something in chat. I read it out loud.

01:04:32
<transcript>: they

01:04:32
cult_hero: PHP 8 is incredibly good with strict mode - plus the ecosystem is great and composer is the best package manager out there

01:04:38
<transcript>: They're all from the simpsons. That one's from there's no way that one's from the simpsons. That one's way, too. Rated X.

01:04:39
thdxr: Only channel owners can verify their phone number.

01:04:41
<transcript>: There's no way, right.

01:04:47
thdxr: can you try putting in my phone number?

01:04:47
<transcript>: They're all from simpsons. Bless your Innocent, aren't you? Yeah. No, I'm from the Ozarks.

01:04:47
<transcript>: i don't get

01:04:49
<transcript>: I don't get out a lot.

01:04:49
<transcript>: there's

01:04:50
thdxr: I'll send you the sms

01:04:55
<transcript>: There's no way that when someone tell me if that one's from the instance I need to see like a YouTube clip, there's no way.

01:04:58
emerycik: Any opinion on .NET?

01:05:05
<transcript>: There's money in programming. Still, I think so. We had to manually raid them. How do you manually rate them? You just all left and decided you're going into the aw stream. That's funny.

01:05:05
<transcript>: you

01:05:09
mehulsharmamat: ooh i love life itself good song

01:05:09
trivenge: but your pay may decrease in the future. there was a talk about this on an investment and business talk featuring forbes and a number of t500 companies, and the consensus is, that in the future, devv pay must come down was the talk.

01:05:11
bishopdev: @triveNge it's not quite like that, outsourcing companies got hit but most product companies, especially in essential services + industry

01:05:13
<transcript>: You convince one of them to follow you. Is that true? Dax just ran into mpm cache, mini match problems. Oh, hell, no, that sounds awful.

01:05:13
<transcript>: hello

01:05:23
<transcript>: Hello, colt. Hero. I've noticed that recruiters aren't beating down the door on LinkedIn as they were a year ago. Do you feel this is uniform across Second Street? Focus on specific developer girls. No, it's probably pretty uniform.

01:05:24
kauai_life: @Emerycik love it

01:05:27
<transcript>: I think hiring slowed a bit.

01:05:31
william_jacob: There is a video on youtube: "25 Years of PHP (by the Creator of PHP)", it gives you a very good understanding of why php works the way it does

01:05:37
<transcript>: And I'm sure there's less recruiting going on during this little stretch. I think it'll recover. It always recovers. Economy go up. It's how it works, right.

01:05:37
<transcript>: i think

01:05:39
<transcript>: I think.

01:05:42
<transcript>: And the reason I think.

01:05:42
<transcript>: i said that

01:05:43
trivenge: it wont recover

01:05:44
trivenge: lol

01:06:02
<transcript>: I said that so flippantly. The reason I think it'll recover and the reason I think generally things get better over time. This is rational, optimist stuff. So I'm not like these are not my own thoughts. It's just books I've read. But generally there are more people in the world waking up every day, trying to make the world better than the opposite or people who just don't care. There's more people waking up every day and trying.

01:06:02
<transcript>: to improve

01:06:04
bishopdev: it will, it'll just take some time

01:06:05
smilingbig: after all the ai breaks everything we'll get hired again LUL

01:06:05
trivenge: its far too saturated at the lower end. how will it recover? people who are at the gate will need to find a different career path

01:06:09
<transcript>: To improve the lives of them and then people around them. So I think generally it'll recover. Just generally. Things trend upward.

01:06:09
<transcript>: no worries

01:06:21
<transcript>: No worries. You can see how you said it in the clip. Oh, boy. Sounds exactly like the words. I don't know. This is awful. I'm going to get canceled. Adam is like anchorman, not Ron burgundy. Over here reads everything that comes on teleprompter. It's so true. I really do.

01:06:21
<transcript>: i'm a cs

01:06:27

01:06:33
<transcript>: junior

01:06:36
<transcript>: Junior Desert struggling too many devs now.

01:06:47
<transcript>: I'm not a free agent. Why am I not a free agent? Dax, I can be whatever I want. Are you my agent? No. I'm a free agent. Clear data on this as well. Far too many people to junior level. Not enough. Good programs at the upper level.

01:06:51
<transcript>: Can you lead me to the verify thing? Do I really have to do I have to do it again.

01:07:16
<transcript>: I love life itself. Good song. Agreed. Any opinion on Net? Emery? Great question. I started my career in Net, spent my first five years writing only Net. I think it was great. I had a great time writing Net. Oh, Alison, you already took care of it. Thanks.

01:07:22
trivenge: oh no, license is always a great gatekeeping tool SeemsGood

01:07:22
greatgrievance: @triveNge i disagree. I think the bar for entry has just gone up a little, for the time being.

01:07:24
<transcript>: Basically, if you're a dev, now, you made it enjoy. Oh, that's a bummer. It'll recover. It'll recover. There's going to be plenty of new jobs created.

01:07:24
<transcript>: it's going to

01:07:31
<transcript>: It's going to recover. Only channel owners can verify their phone number. Can you try putting in my phone number? Yes. Send it to me.

trivenge: the bar has gone up because there are too many people at the gate, yes @GreatGrievance

01:07:45
thdxr: just don't leak it

01:07:49
<transcript>: Okay, by the way, about your pay may decrease in the future. There was a talk about this on an investment business stock featuring Forbes. A number of tfit 500 companies consider future Dev pay must come down. Yeah. No. I believe we were probably in a big bubble. I think we've been getting paid too much. Maybe. I don't know. Oh, I have your fun.

01:07:49
<transcript>: funeral

01:07:50

01:07:57
sockthedev: have y'all noticed copilot getting much better recently? it's crazy how much code it is writing for me now.

01:07:59
<transcript>: Let's find it.

01:08:11
<transcript>: Let's find this phone number. I don't have it memorized. Do you guys remember when you were young and you had your friends numbers memorized? Because you said, type it in like a monkey every time you want to talk to them. Okay, here we go.

01:08:12
thdxr: don't read it out loud

01:08:15
thdxr: like you read everything out loud

01:08:16
<transcript>: I'm not sharing my screen, right.

01:08:16
<transcript>: should probably

01:08:18
jaystation3x: More than 5 years of .NET. The shift branch alone lasted 3.5 years.

01:08:25

01:08:26

01:08:37
jokestera_e: I remember taking my friends number and signing them up at those remodeling kiosks at the mall so they would get constant calls

01:08:37
<transcript>: There's a video on YouTube. 25 years of php by the creator of php. It gives you a very good understanding why php works the way it does. Okay.

01:08:43
<transcript>: We might check that out. After all, I missed it.

01:08:43
greatgrievance: @triveNge too many? no, people are just lining up at the gate before they're actually ready to ship software

01:08:51
<transcript>: Bar has gone up because there are too many people at the gate. Just don't leak it. I won't leak it if you all notice copilot getting much better recently. It's crazy how much code. I haven't noticed that, but I'd like to.

01:08:54
<transcript>: Don't read it out loud like you read.

01:08:56
<transcript>: Harsh.

01:08:57
bishopdev: I can tell you from my experience looking for a new job, 3 years ago I had to block recruiters, stuff was insane, companies just throwing money. this past month interviewing has been a wake up call, actually have to put in some effort

01:09:00
<transcript>: Number. Okay. Here we go. Look. Iphone. Here we go.

01:09:00
onewobblybadger: Still remember my grandparents land line number they they haven’t had in 10

01:09:06
<transcript>: only

01:09:12
<transcript>: Only mean you get that phone number verified. Congratulations. We did it. Now what are we done.

01:09:32

<transcript>: Okay.

01:09:34
<transcript>: just you

01:09:46
greatgrievance: @triveNge for a long time, all you had to do was prove you could learn. You didn't actually need to know much. That was never going to last

01:09:49
<transcript>: Just you. Boomer. What am I, the boomer? I still remember my friend's phone number from when I was eight. I could probably if I thought hard enough, I could probably remember some phone numbers. Your screen is being shared. Stop it, stop it. Behold. Just trolling me.

01:09:49

01:10:01
<transcript>: Somebody else built it and it's better than I would have ever built it.

01:10:13
<transcript>: So we're going to look at if it works. We're going to try it out here in just a second. You can upload massive videos now, here we go. Now you can upload the video. Here we go. Big, massive video episode.

dmdboi: who would do that

01:10:49

<transcript>: And it needs to find the most interesting clips. And it exists. It's called.

01:11:17
<transcript>: I'm never going to remember the name of this opus. Opus, clip.

01:11:21
<transcript>: It's not a side project it's a side side project it's so true.

01:11:33
<transcript>: Things out loud. That's funny, Warren. You can change your tweak username, too. Oh, did somebody just change it? Just for me, podcast equals side Project Podcast tool equals side side project? That's a good point. It's a side project for our side project.

01:11:38
yoloswag360noscope: I think the problem is people can work in this field without degrees and even call themself engineers, you need a liscense to cal yourself an engineer ( at least in my country). Why can someone who watched youtube call themself an engineer

01:11:40
<transcript>: Inception. Okay. Now I got to see. Let's see if this video made it onto YouTube. Then.

01:11:40
<transcript>: i'll go over

01:11:42
<transcript>: I'll go over to my screen and we'll look at it.

01:11:46
<transcript>: Still processing.

01:11:46
<transcript>: okay

01:11:53
mehulsharmamat: @thdxr the node 18 solution worked

01:11:54
<transcript>: Okay. While it's processing, I really have to pee. How much time do we record? In 30 minutes, zacks? Yeah, we do. In 30 minutes. Right. Okay. I'll be right back. Got a pee.

01:11:58
<transcript>: I won't leave you long it'll just be a minute.

01:11:59
thdxr: woo

01:12:11
mehulsharmamat: i have no idea what it does tho but it WORKS!

01:12:13
trivenge: adams gonna pee and watch dax while hes on stream

01:12:14
trivenge: payback

01:12:28
sockthedev: adam has a bladder problem. honestly might have an infection. should see a doctor.

01:12:28
greatgrievance: @yoloswag360noscope imo, you shouldn't need a license for anything unless there a chance of severe damage. Building a bridge? get a license. Building a todo app? no license required

01:12:47
trivenge: maybe he takes stimulants, coffee, adderall, who knows

01:12:55
trivenge: i take adderall, and peeing a lot is fun :)

01:12:58
fixdib: @triveNge imao

01:12:59
bishopdev: @yoloswag360noscope I can clal myself w/e I want

01:13:15
yoloswag360noscope: @yoloswag360noscope true true, but at least need the CS degree then, this is why theres job saturation anyone can enter the field

01:13:29
adjectiveallison: If you drink a lot of water you pee a lot

01:14:03
jaystation3x: Stop watching Adam then because he doesn't have a CS degree.

01:14:11
trivenge: ^

01:14:17
trivenge: you guys need to gatekeep harder, ok?

01:14:26
greatgrievance: @yoloswag360noscope I had already shipped multiple sites/apps well before i graduated high school. Why do I need a CS degree? We don't need artificial barriers. Either you can or you can't build the thing you client/employer needs.

01:14:26
thdxr: i don't have a cs degree

01:14:26
trivenge: im disappointed in your gatekeeping skills

01:14:32
jaystation3x: Neither do I

01:14:35
adjectiveallison: I have 5 CS degrees

01:14:40
thdxr: adam doesn't have one and it shows!

01:14:41
sockthedev: i feel like this laravel play is just adam fishing for followers

01:14:41
canslaughter: @yoloswag360noscope just verify all your code in coq. Math doesn't care about degrees

01:14:42
mehulsharmamat: i dont have a cs degree but i also suck so...

01:14:42
adjectiveallison: none of them are real though

01:14:52
<transcript>: All right. Did it work? Is there a video? I guess you guys wouldn't know.

01:14:55
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:14:55
<transcript>: still processing

01:14:56
serudda: wuaaaa @adamdotdev who did you do the “I'll be right back” scene? It's beautiful, do you have a guide or a tutorial about it? Thanks in advance...

01:14:56
<transcript>: Still processing.

01:14:59
mehulsharmamat: wait... how many people ACTUALLY have a cs degree?

01:15:04
<transcript>: It's like a 30 minutes video. Does it take that long to process a 30 minutes video? I don't know. I don't know anything about YouTube. Anybody know.

01:15:07
nxia618: hey all, laravel docs looks so enticing

01:15:08
<transcript>: Seruta.

01:15:16
trivenge: 10-30 minutes

01:15:17
<transcript>: Who did? Who did you do? The. I'll be right back. Scene. It's beautiful. Do you have a guide or a tutorial about it? Thanks. In advance. No, siruda. I don't have any guides.

01:15:17
bishopdev: I don't have a CS degree, but I plan on getting one cause I get a 15% tax discount for it

01:15:19
trivenge: sometimes longer

01:15:20
<transcript>: So all my overlays.

01:15:22
<transcript>: Are designed by David.

01:15:24
greatgrievance: @nxia618 laravel docs is laravel's best selling point

01:15:24
adamdotdev: !david

01:15:25
fossabot: Adam regularly uses David Hill for design work. You can check out David's personal site at https://iamdavidhill.com/ which includes links to socials!

01:15:29
mehulsharmamat: @BishopDev woah i hope i got funded to do stuff like that

01:15:34
<transcript>: My designer friend, David, let's see here. David. You could reach out to David if you want David Hill to do your design work, he designed all my overlays and then the music is all Breakmaster cylinder.

01:15:38
<transcript>: I don't know if I have a command.

01:15:38
adamdotdev: !theme

01:15:38
fossabot: Adam uses the Dracula theme with the Operator Mono font in Neovim.

01:15:39
yoloswag360noscope: @yoloswag360noscope oh i'm aware of that, just saying that to work in any other profession you mostly need a certification most of the time

01:15:39
<transcript>: For.

01:15:41
adamdotdev: !music

01:15:41
fossabot: Adam's stream music is created by Breakmaster Cylinder. Check them out on twitter @ https://twitter.com/brkmstrcylinder

01:15:43
<transcript>: Music.

01:15:46
<transcript>: Yeah, breakmaster, cylinder.

01:15:46
<transcript>: and speaking of

01:15:47
trivenge: !youtube

01:15:51
<transcript>: And speaking of music, where did the music go? Did it stop it? Did the music stop.

01:15:52
adjectiveallison: David doesn't have a valid SSL certificate

01:15:52
trivenge: !tiktok

01:15:54
<transcript>: It stopped.

01:15:57
serudda: Thanks!

01:15:58
adjectiveallison: maybe you should help him with that since he did your overlays

01:16:01
<transcript>: There we go. So we're still waiting on YouTube. David doesn't have a valid ssl certificate.

01:16:02
mehulsharmamat: im really scared of adding payment to aws because i have no idea what's happening and i don't want to pay $100k a month

01:16:05
<transcript>: Maybe I should.

01:16:06
trivenge: omg adam doesnt post his content clips on tiktok NotLikeThis

01:16:16
<transcript>: I didn't know david's site didn't have an sl shirt. That's not good. I'm really scared of adding payment to aws because I have no idea what's happening and I don't want to pay $100,000 a month. May. Listen.

01:16:16
<transcript>: those

01:16:19
<transcript>: Those fears are unfounded.

01:16:19
<transcript>: there's a little

01:16:19
greatgrievance: david mustve missed the LetsEncrypt transition

01:16:22
<transcript>: There's a little piece of larbar laying on my desk.

01:16:26
<transcript>: You're not going to end up with $100 bill.

01:16:28
thdxr: @mehulsharmamat that's more likely to happen to you on vercel lol

01:16:30
<transcript>: If you're building it in a modern way.

01:16:30
<transcript>: like with

01:16:32
<transcript>: Like with SST.

01:16:33
mehulsharmamat: @thdxr ayo lmao

01:16:39
thdxr: he's deploying with SST

01:16:40
<transcript>: We're like going to have it on forcellia. If you're building with ssc, there's just no way you're going to rack up a big bill because you're going to use services that are very cheap.

01:16:41
thdxr: i think

01:16:44
william_jacob: Maybe a fun idea to look at large scale open source laravel projects to get an idea of what you can build with it?

01:16:46
trivenge: cant you just get a random debit card from mastercard, a prepaid, and just set a specific amount on there? @mehulsharmamat

01:16:51
mehulsharmamat: @thdxr is sst serverless? lambda thingy?

01:16:54
thdxr: and they always refund mistakes

01:16:56
<transcript>: I got to start posting stuff on TikTok.

01:17:00
trivenge: they have prepaid cards at walmart

01:17:06
<transcript>: Yeah? Aws.

01:17:09
mehulsharmamat: @triveNge yep probably will do that

01:17:11
mattmancodes: I don't have a CS degree, nor do I personally call myself an Engineer. I've only been doing this for ~20 yrs now so something must be going right without one.

01:17:11
darrenbaldwin03: omg

01:17:13
<transcript>: If you make a big mistake and you get a big bill. In the rare case, what happens? They work with them, they refund it.

01:17:18
<transcript>: Or forgive it or whatever.

01:17:19
alexandersix_: What's up what's up? Pumped that you've caught the Laravel bug!

01:17:37
sockthedev: phew, theo was raging in that twitter space on the whole edge dialogue. saw you in there adam. awkward.

<transcript>: Dax said something about my hair one day and started this storyline where I fix my hair now.

01:17:41
thdxr: i built rox's product in 1hr yesterday and it can scale infinitely with no overhead

01:17:42
<transcript>: I still don't feel great about it.

01:17:46
trivenge: LUL

01:17:47
<transcript>: But it does look better than when I let it fall down on my face.

01:17:51
mehulsharmamat: @thdxr woah which one

01:17:54
<transcript>: It doesn't look good. Alex. Alex. Alexander. Thank you for the prime sub.

01:17:55
sj_se: @adamdotdev do we have to talk about tech stuff or can we tell each other our deepest secrets?

01:19:09
mattmancodes: portuguese

01:19:15
<transcript>: I listened to some of that space last night. I didn't hear him say anything about Edge, though. That's funny.

01:19:24
mehulsharmamat: serverless CSS

01:19:25
chrispian: Yeah, he got hot on the edge topic lol

01:19:28
trivenge: i entered rox's chat and was talkin about youtube and he wasnt in a good mood that day. says he knows a lot about youtube. and im like, i didnt know you know more than night media does, if you do, please share, but like, hes a cool dude SeemsGood

01:19:29
thdxr: @mehulsharmamat do you want me to rebuild your product too?

01:19:30
<transcript>: Did I hear him say anything about Edge? No, I didn't. But yeah, no, just don't call things the wrong thing. And then nobody will get upset like it's really easy. Just don't mix up words and confuse people. No one gets mad, I think.

01:19:30
<transcript>: i'm going to write reason

01:19:33

01:20:19

pankexillo: What IDE are you using for Laravel? I'm using Phpstorm myself with the LaravelIdea plugin, it's so good

01:23:55
onewobblybadger: In my youth I would draw skeezy badgers on things while drunk at parties

01:24:00
<transcript>: Niaz moss. I'm not going to try. How are you going to build a project with larava, or are you just trolling? No, I really am. Okay, I'm not a troll. Honestly, sometimes I'm a troll. But right now I'm not a troll. I'm really into larryville. I'm going to build something with it. I started this stream with every intention.

01:24:00
trivenge: laravel and mojo are the future? POGGERS

01:24:07
thdxr: yooooo

01:24:09
thdxr: LARAVEL SCAM

01:24:12
<transcript>: Of building this new project in laravel. And then someone was like, hey, look, this already exists. It's called opus, and it really does. It's exactly what I wanted. And it's also backed by Lightspeed.

01:24:12
thdxr: ADAM IS DOING A LARAVEL SCAM NOW

01:24:15
mattmancodes: hahaha

01:24:28
<transcript>: Pretty famous investor vigor Capital affirm. So I'm confident this thing's going to make it. It's going to be the thing that I need. So I don't need to build that project. So I got to come up with a new project. But I'm going to build something with laravel. I promise on stream I'm going to build something.

01:24:28
<transcript>: fuz

01:24:30
mehulsharmamat: @thdxr +1. everyone is ignoring this scam that's happening in DAYLIGHT

01:24:31
<transcript>: Fuzzy Screen, by the way, wait.

01:24:33
charafmrah: @thdxr damn

01:24:38
<transcript>: This has been fuzzy this whole time. I'm so sorry, everybody. I mean, there's nothing to see, but I'm sorry it was fuzzy.

01:24:45
warrenbuffering: there's VCs who invest in PHP based tech?

01:24:50
<transcript>: Okay, if you're running Fmpeg, this shit is going to get super hard to deploy, not going to work on any service platform. You can run Ssmpeg in serverless stuff. Dax, what are you talking about? Also, by the way.

01:24:52
trivenge: rebuild your macbook channel redemption in laravel. no balls SeemsGood

01:25:00
tadeucaldas: dude.. thats a lot of tabs

01:25:00
<transcript>: By the way, I just missed it. By the way, I just deployed it. I think it works on prod, but working. I mean, it loads up nice pot twists. They're not entrant.

01:25:06
alexandersix_: You might need to add another tab or two while you wait

01:25:09
tadeucaldas: lol

01:25:10
<transcript>: Thank God for sst. What IDE are you using for laravel? I'm using PHP for myself with the layer of L idea plugin it's so good. So I plan on just using neo vim.

01:25:10
<transcript>: that's what

01:25:11
alexandersix_: Don't think there are enough LUL

01:25:12
<transcript>: That's what I've poked around and so far.

01:25:12
<transcript>: i have not

01:25:16
<transcript>: I have not looked into neo vim support.

01:25:16
<transcript>: like does

01:25:19
trivenge: how do you guys have less than 100 tabs? serious

01:25:20
<transcript>: Like does the lsp work well? And I have no idea.

01:25:22
dmdboi: Open a tab on Franz Ferdinand

01:25:24
mehulsharmamat: you can run ffmpeg on serverless but vercel has 10/60s timeout for execution. lambda has 15m which is really good but still, dangerous

01:25:26
alexandersix_: I write Laravel exclusively in Neovim, it's great

01:25:28
<transcript>: But that's what I usually use. So I was just assuming in my use I would draw skeezy Badgers on things while drunk at parties.

01:25:28
<transcript>: fun

<transcript>: You're scamming.

01:25:40
<transcript>: there's

01:25:44
alexandersix_: I use intellephense as the LSP. The paid version, specifically (it's a one-time purchase for a few bucks)

01:25:44
<transcript>: There's vcs who invest in php based tech.

01:25:44
<transcript>: who

01:25:49
thdxr: i fixed it

01:25:51

derzemba: @adamdotdev Do you read twitch dms? where could one reach you?

01:26:09
thdxr: @mehulsharmamat SST has a long running job concept that's like a lambda function that can run for 8 hours

01:26:11
<transcript>: That's a lot of times. Yeah, it is a lot of tabs, I guess. Might need to add another tab or two while you wait. Yeah. Oh, here we go. We got clips. We got clips.

warrenbuffering: Dax do u race F1 now?

01:26:16
thdxr: imma set it up for rox today then you can use it too

01:26:16

01:26:24
<transcript>: It had the clock emoji.

01:26:29
charafmrah: no sound

01:26:29
dmmulroy: @thdxr can't believe you're a red bull fan

01:26:39
mehulsharmamat: @mehulsharmamat oh! but still im making like 100 internal api reqs. i seriously have no idea but that's like 100 function invocations? that's like a lot right?

01:26:44
thdxr: @dmmulroy im not i hate them

01:26:44
<transcript>: Ssc has a long running job concept that's like a lambda function that can run for 8 hours.

01:26:46
gitpush__gitpaid: my man still didnt update his browser

01:26:48
<transcript>: Dex, did you ever answer when I said you can, too.

01:26:50
dmmulroy: @dmmulroy <3

01:26:50
<transcript>: What are you talking about.

01:27:01
dmmulroy: McLaren fan here :')

01:27:03
thdxr: @adamdotdev because most ffmpeg work takes more than 15min

01:27:04
<transcript>: Alexander, you write laravel exclusive in the of them you can run Fsmpeg on a lambda function. What are you talking about? Brussels has 1060 2nd timeout for execution. Lambda has 15 Mint which is really good but still dangerous.

01:27:09
<transcript>: Oh, you're saying for like media processing stuff.

01:27:16
<transcript>: Okay, let's do this because most Ffmpig work takes more than 15 minutes. Oh, I got you. Yeah. Okay.

01:27:18
<transcript>: So yeah, I guess.

01:27:21
<transcript>: It depends on what you're doing.

01:27:21
<transcript>: i've done

01:27:25
<transcript>: I've done a lot of small things that we know.

01:27:25
<transcript>: well

01:27:27
<transcript>: Well.

01:27:27
<transcript>: it's very specific

01:27:30
mehulsharmamat: so my ffmpeg thing takes 3-8s per request, but i have like ~60 for a 5min video input.

01:27:39
jaystation3x: SM does it.

01:27:42
<transcript>: It's very specific. Some sat me stuff that we use ffmpeg in Lambda functions for, but we know all the possible clips. We know it's not going to take very long, I guess, is what I'm getting at three to 8 seconds per request. So I have like 60 for a five minute video input. I got you.

01:27:46
<transcript>: Jstation. Stamp Use. Does it? That's right, jay's. Here.

01:27:46
<transcript>: jay i miss

01:27:48

mehulsharmamat: buuut i did test on my machine so maybe cloud isnt as compute heavy idk what im talking about at this point

01:27:55
<transcript>: That sword badge. No big deal.

01:28:06
adjectiveallison: @jaystation3x Where did you get your sword?

01:28:09
<transcript>: But I did test on my machine, so maybe cloud isn't as compute heavy. I don't know what I'm talking about at this point there should just be like a managed Ffmpig service that should just be a thing. It's a common enough use case. Can I open this up over here.

01:28:09
<transcript>: just watch

01:28:10
jaystation3x: You missed all my earlier comments!

01:28:11
<transcript>: Just watch this clip.

01:28:19
mehulsharmamat: @thdxr tysm!

01:28:19
<transcript>: Let's watch this clip. Let's see if they're good. Oh, 99 on the virality score. It's a low res preview, though.

01:28:24
<transcript>: If this works, I'm going to be incredibly happy.

01:29:01
gitpush__gitpaid: the pretentiousness "im not very relatable"

01:29:04
mehulsharmamat: im gonna hop off and do some gymin

<transcript>: You hate this clip backs. Okay, we'll delete it. We won't use it.

thdxr: literally me talking about how my equinox memebership when i jetted between nyc and miami

01:29:28
<transcript>: By the way, our sonic came yesterday. It's in two giant crates. And I don't know how I'm going to build it. I would love to hire someone actually who can come over and build it for me. That would be great.

01:29:28
<transcript>: literally

01:29:44
gitpush__gitpaid: doubles down on not being relatable by talking about his sauna

01:29:46
<transcript>: Literally me talking about how my equinox membership went. I jetted between New York City and my yeah, that's not going to do well. Or maybe it will do well. And we lean into what's? That guy that people say you look like dax. Maybe we lean into that. We lean into the bro.

01:29:46
<transcript>: thing

01:29:51
<transcript>: Thing doubles down on not being relatable by talking about it. Sonic. Yeah, sorry.

01:29:56
<transcript>: What's that guy's name.

01:29:56
<transcript>: not

01:29:57
thdxr: let's pretend our net worths are 100x

01:29:57
alexandersix_: My parents' neighbor literally built an entire sauna building in his backyard from the ground up. Learned everything from YouTube, apparently

01:30:03
daglee: Have you heard about the sauna world cup? They had to bann it because people died.

01:30:04
<transcript>: Not Jordan peterson. That name's popping in my head. Why is that popping in my head? Let's pretend our net worth are 100 X. Yeah, exactly.

01:30:04
trivenge: i would just contact some contractors locally or regionally

01:30:05
thdxr: Andrew Tate

01:30:06
bishopdev: something with a B

01:30:08
trivenge: joe rogan?

01:30:12
<transcript>: No. What is that guy's name that people say you look like dax. Andrew tate. Yeah, let's lean into it. Talk about saunas and stuff.

01:30:12
<transcript>: this one's

trivenge: oh

01:30:14
<transcript>: This one's a 96.

01:30:16
trivenge: kyrie irving?

01:30:18
trivenge: LUL

01:30:21
bishopdev: LMAO, he looks nothing like andrew tate

trivenge: definitely kyrie irving

01:30:37
mehulsharmamat: id love to make a dax andrew tate edit

01:30:43
<transcript>: Is this gonna work? Dax? Do you think they're gonna work.

01:30:45
daglee: Dax looks like Andrew Tate? I have never heard that! LUL LUL LUL

01:30:51
adjectiveallison: I think it's going to work

01:31:01
dmdboi: Wow this service is pretty powerful

01:31:03
<transcript>: Wait. Did that. Was it. That was the whole clip. You think it's going to work? Where was the punchline on this one.

01:31:05
thdxr: lol the emojis

01:31:10
trivenge: LUL

01:31:12
gitpush__gitpaid: that clip is wack

01:31:14
<transcript>: I gotta listen more closely.

01:31:20
thdxr: here's the thing I want to MANUALLY grab a time slice which is pretty easy and have something process the rest

01:31:23
onewobblybadger: Not enough fire emojis. Gotta get that zoomer traffic

01:31:25
<transcript>: Okay. Okay.

01:31:27
gitpush__gitpaid: that clips comes off like dax is sad vice is going bankrupt

01:31:31
mhuggins7278: didn't take get arrest for human trafficing not sure you want to lean into that one :D

01:31:34
<transcript>: Here's the thing. I want to manually grab a time slice, which is pretty easy and have something process arrest. Oh, I see. So you're saying.

01:31:34
<transcript>: not just

01:31:36
<transcript>: Not just automatic.

01:31:36
bishopdev: @adamdotdev think you meant Dan Bilzerian

01:31:38
mhuggins7278: tate not take

01:31:47
<transcript>: Topic selection, stuff. Like, you want to just do it manually? Yeah, I agree. That would be good, actually, you know what, dax? You kind of kind of do that. You can kind of do it in Riverside.

01:31:47
<transcript>: i'll show

01:31:50
<transcript>: I'll show you so in Riverside.

01:31:50
<transcript>: here is our

01:31:52
thdxr: if we just uploaded a smaller segment to this service and let it do everything else that would work

01:31:53
<transcript>: Here is our Edit and create clips.

01:31:53
<transcript>: so we want to

01:31:55
<transcript>: So we want to make a story.

01:31:55
<transcript>: it's got

01:31:57
<transcript>: It's got the transcript. Here.

01:31:59
thdxr: yeah i tried doing it in riverside but it also had issues

01:32:01
thdxr: i tried everything!

01:32:01
adjectiveallison: @thdxr I agree with this approach

01:32:09
<transcript>: I wouldn't say it's easy to select a time range. You would think they would make that easy. Oh, wait, it is. You just drag it from the ends. Okay. So you get some clip like this. You say we want to do.

01:32:15
<transcript>: The full frame AI so it bounces between us, right. And then we want to do.

01:32:18
<transcript>: Does it do captions. I don't remember.

01:32:18
<transcript>: it might not do

01:32:22
<transcript>: It might not do captions, but I can do that easy enough.

01:32:22
thdxr: it doesn't do subs though

01:32:26
thdxr: that's the issue with riverside

01:32:27
<transcript>: Okay, how do I play it? How do I play it? Oh, here we go.

01:32:27
<transcript>: so it

01:32:32
thdxr: every tool has 1 big flaw

01:32:35
<transcript>: So it bounces between us. But you can choose clips just like that. It doesn't do subs. Okay, I can do the subzo. Dax.

01:32:43
thdxr: hmm

01:32:43
<transcript>: I can do the subs. Every tool has one big plot. So true. Do we still need to build it? Do we just need to build our own? Is that what you're saying.

01:32:50
<transcript>: I can do subs so easy though like I don't mind.

01:32:50
<transcript>: if you want to cut

01:32:51
mattmancodes: subs scam

01:32:51
jaystation3x: Isn't this fairly quick to do in Premiere?

01:33:01
<transcript>: If you want to cut clips and send them to me, I can run through Premiere Pro and have them subtitled in no time. Yeah, exactly. Jay, Premiere Pro has really good subtitles. I don't know if people know that.

01:33:01
<transcript>: i know people

01:33:06
thdxr: ugh why can't davinci resolve have this feature

01:33:09
thdxr: would solve everything

01:33:16
<transcript>: I know people have problems with Premiere Pro, and they prefer whatever else for a lot of reasons, but it's really good with the subs like transcriptions and adding captions. Why can't debit you resolve have this user it would solve everything. Yeah. How about dax? Listen, let's use Riverside.

01:33:16
<transcript>: so

01:33:20
<transcript>: So I'm not saying we're not going to do this. I think we could do this, too.

01:33:20
<transcript>: if

01:33:22
<transcript>: If.

01:33:22
<transcript>: it finds

01:33:25
<transcript>: It finds good ones. Then we use them. If it doesn't.

01:33:25
<transcript>: then

01:33:38
<transcript>: Then we don't. But this is worth trying. I guess I can't pay for this yet. They won't let me do unlimited. Look at all these clips. Look at that 15 of them. I think this has potential. I think if they could add a few features to this.

01:33:38
<transcript>: and

01:33:38
dmdboi: What was that about Dax and subbing?

01:33:42
<transcript>: And it actually surfaced. Good clips has potential.

01:33:42
<transcript>: camran

01:33:42
thdxr: i also hate the "upload download" from webservice flow

01:33:44
<transcript>: Camran. Thank you for that. Follow.

01:33:45
thdxr: everything is slow

01:33:53
<transcript>: What was that about? Daxon subbing. I'll say the upload download from Web service Flow, upload download from Web service Flow. Everything is slow? Yeah.

01:33:53
<transcript>: i know

01:34:02
<transcript>: I know. I wish it was like riverside doesn't have that problem, right? Because we record in riverside, so it should have all the video pretty quickly.

01:34:02
<transcript>: i think

01:34:09
<transcript>: I think this is a good like. You cut out clips. You like dax using riverside. You send them to me.

01:34:09
<transcript>: and

01:34:11
<transcript>: And.

01:34:15
<transcript>: I'll add captions, Does this do a good job with.

01:34:18
<transcript>: Our faces not being.

01:34:18
<transcript>: cut

01:34:23
<transcript>: Cut off. Yeah. I just got to be in the middle of my thing. I just got to make sure I'm in the middle.

01:34:23
<transcript>: right

01:34:25
<transcript>: Right.

01:36:51
<transcript>: That. I did get them a new macbook. Okay, I really got to go. I don't need to defend my scamming. I don't scam. I'll see you all in dax's chat. Potentially while we record a podcast. It's been fun. Maybe we could do it again sometime.
