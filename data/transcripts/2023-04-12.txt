11:30:53
<transcript>: Devin is here. The synth wave drummond bass gets me going in the morning. It's pretty nice. Does anyone know the name of the current song? Yeah. All the music, all the sound effects, everything you hear on this stream, Besides, my voice is Breakmaster cylinder. He made all my stuff. So I've got a handful of variations, like different genres.

11:30:53
<transcript>: of the

11:30:56
<transcript>: Of the theme song all that kind of stuff.

11:30:56
<transcript>: and

11:30:59
<transcript>: And Allen already.

11:30:59
<transcript>: told

11:31:08
<transcript>: Told that cool. I love when I read chat, and then I read more, and I learned that I didn't need to say what I just said. Nicola is here. Hello, Pixel perfect. Overlay.

11:31:08
<transcript>: that's all

11:31:10
lesabotsy: Good morning sir, good morning y'all.

11:31:12
<transcript>: That's all? David. My designer friend. David.

11:31:22
<transcript>: To the J. Thank you so much for that follow. 52 minutes ago. I don't know what was happening on my Twitch stream 52 minutes ago, but I appreciate it. You may not still be here. You probably aren't.

11:31:29
<transcript>: But. Okay, I'm going to stop now. Wow. There's a bunch of people that followed me while I was sleeping or otherwise, not streaming.

11:31:41
<transcript>: Rastafari and dev Cheese D backslash Yeboo The lemony pedro Kyle Smith Luke sh.

11:31:41
<transcript>: is

11:31:44
<transcript>: Is that actually his domain? I wonder. That's a good one.

11:31:46
lesabotsy: The algorithm design manual is killing me, hope this is all worth it :'(

11:31:49
<transcript>: Thank you all for the follows. I appreciate them.

11:32:05
<transcript>: Aj's here. Yes, I did. Do I did have brakemaster cylinder do my mute actually had to make all the original theme song he made for our podcast Tomorrow FM. And then I was like, I'm just going to use this for everything.

11:32:05
<transcript>: it's going to be my

11:32:07
<transcript>: It's going to be my theme song.

11:32:07
<transcript>: if adam

11:32:09
<transcript>: If Adam had a sound on the internet.

11:32:09
<transcript>: and so

11:32:15
<transcript>: And so I asked him if he could make different versions of it. And I think we've made like six or seven now.

11:32:15
<transcript>: i've got another

11:32:23
<transcript>: I've got another one coming. I just keep making him because he's the best and working with breakmaster cylinder has been one of the best experiences of my life.

11:32:27
<transcript>: Getting married having my kids.

11:32:39
<transcript>: Working with Brigmaster cylinder. I don't know. It's up there. He's so interesting. What an interesting guy. If you don't follow him on Twitter, you should follow him on Twitter.

11:32:39
<transcript>: he is one of

11:32:49
<transcript>: He is one of the most interesting human beings on the planet. Assuming he's a human being, there are a lot of mysteries around breakmaster cylinder. No one's seen his face.

11:32:51
<transcript>: So I got this mask on.

11:32:51
<transcript>: and any portrayal

11:32:56
<transcript>: And any portrayal of him. There's rumors that he lives on a spaceship.

11:33:03
thdxr: working with Dax?

11:33:09
<transcript>: He apparently has a lot of friends, squirrels that he's feeding throughout his days in the park or whatever. Just follow him on Twitter. You'll see what I'm talking about? One of the most interesting people ever. And he makes amazing sound.

11:33:09
<transcript>: i call it

11:33:12
<transcript>: I call it sound because I don't even know some of it's. Not even music.

11:33:12
<transcript>: he's just really

11:33:18
<transcript>: He's just really good at making sounds. Good morning, development. Robot and I'm is here.

11:33:20
<transcript>: And bodhi is here.

11:33:20
<transcript>: yo

11:33:26
<transcript>: Yoast is making jokes on Twitter about me. Oh, I got to see him. Please provide links.

11:33:31
<transcript>: Lesa Botsy's here. Good morning, sir. Good morning. All the algorithm doing.

11:33:31
<transcript>: a design

11:33:37
<transcript>: A design manual is killing me. Hope this is all worth it. The algorithm design manual. What is that.

11:33:50
<transcript>: I've not read the algorithm design manual. I may not know how to design algorithms. Dex is here. Oh, working with that? Yeah. Getting married, having my kids, working with dax, and then Breakmaster cylinder.

11:33:50
<transcript>: that's the highlight

11:33:53
<transcript>: That's the highlights of my life.

11:34:01
joostschuur: It wasn't a particularly original one. About you joining Theo and Dan A. at Vercel.

11:34:11
<transcript>: All right. I'm just going to get into it today. Look at this. I'm going to be five minutes. It was five minutes. People on the Dot. I've been streaming for five minutes. And look at me. I mean, ten minutes of, like, intro stuff, but five minutes and I'm in it. I'm in the code. I got too much to do. People.

11:34:18
<transcript>: Wasn't a particularly original one about you joining theo and Dan at eversell.

11:34:20
vapor__dev: wait wait let's take a break MaxLOL

11:34:24
<transcript>: I did not join roselle. Okay, so.

11:34:24
<transcript>: i'm at like

11:34:32
<transcript>: I'm at, like, Wait, let's take a break, Allen. I know it's easy. I know it's easy to get me to take a break, but I'm going to prove to you that I can focus.

11:34:32
<transcript>: i got

11:34:38
<transcript>: I got so much to do. I'm very into this work. I'm very excited about it's. Like.

11:34:38
<transcript>: sat

11:34:46
<transcript>: Sat Mews was nine years ago. Now that we started status, it's been like nine years of buildup to this moment.

11:34:47
lesabotsy: It's a book written by Steven Skiena, I'm learning algorithms for interview prep

11:34:49
<transcript>: I mean like we're doing pretty good financially, but.

11:34:49
<transcript>: if we could

11:34:59
<transcript>: If we could actually get some percentage of the people who use statins heavily to pay us for it, it just changes a lot. It becomes a lot more exciting.

11:35:04
<transcript>: So very excited. Spend a nine year build up to this moment.

11:35:20
<transcript>: Less about the It's a book written by Stephen Skiana. I'm learning algorithms for Interview Prep. Very cool, lesa. Have you ever. Is this your first job in Tech, or are you a veteran of interviews.

11:35:20
<transcript>: i've never

11:35:23
<transcript>: I've never taken an interview so I can't help you on that front.

11:35:27
<transcript>: I might have advice depending on where you end up working.

11:35:31
<transcript>: For the other part of your career, that's not just getting a job.

11:35:38
<transcript>: So I'm at this crossroads. I'm at a crossroads where I feel pretty good about all this.

11:35:41
<transcript>: I feel pretty good about where I've landed on some of this.

11:35:46
thdxr: how do I get a job in tech

11:35:50
<transcript>: But I can't decide now if I want to do all the stripe plumbing. There's so much plumbing with stripe handling, the webhooks and all that.

11:35:50
<transcript>: i'm not sure

11:35:53
<transcript>: I'm not sure if I want to actually.

11:35:53
<transcript>: put that

11:36:04
<transcript>: Put that work into this dying elixir app that we're moving away from this elixir app, or if I want to actually just start building the stripe integration stuff in SST.

11:36:06
<transcript>: In some modern serverless stuff.

11:36:10
thdxr: definitely do it outside of elixir

11:36:10
tymekdev: @thdxr if you want to be successful you don't apparently

11:36:13
sibookait: how is your experience with Elixir? What would you advise for beginners?

11:36:20
vapor__dev: are you doing everything in typescript going forward?

11:36:24
<transcript>: And just work with the same database. So that when I migrate, when we're finished migrating, it's less to migrate. You know what I'm saying? And I don't have to figure out how to implement all the stripe web hooks and all that stuff in elixir dax. You're smart. Do you think definitely do it outside. Okay. Yeah. I can't think of a downside. Like, what is the problem.

11:36:24
<transcript>: are

11:36:24
darrenbaldwin03: Curious what ur migrating to

11:36:29
<transcript>: Are there any foot guns I'm going to run into if I'm like. I don't know. I'll just stand up.

11:36:29
alanlazzy: you're migrating to?

11:36:36
<transcript>: A different subdomain or something on Stapmies.com that receives the webhooks from stripe seems fine.

11:36:36
<transcript>: is

11:36:36
lesabotsy: I'm interviewing at your company, you just don't know it yet. First, I come from Management / Accounting background.

11:36:37
bodhihawken: haha, i just did my 7th apps stripe integration over the weekend. gets quicker every time

11:36:38
<transcript>: Is that fine.

11:36:43
<transcript>: Just let somebody let me know if you can think of some gotcha that I'm going to run into.

11:36:43
<transcript>: dax how do

11:36:46
<transcript>: Dax, how do I get a job in tech.

11:36:51
thdxr: seems fine to me! as long as elixir can read the state

11:36:52
<transcript>: I think we've had similar careers, right? Not a lot of normal jobs. Someone tell me why I keep spitting.

11:36:52
<transcript>: this was not

11:37:06
<transcript>: This was not a thing I streamed for four months before, and I don't feel like every time I spoke I shot little spit particles. Is it the lights? Are they hitting it in just the right way. I've moved my lights around a little bit. I feel like every time I say.

11:37:06
<transcript>: like

11:37:12
<transcript>: Like a word or I don't know. There's some words I'm saying, and it's just like.

11:37:12
<transcript>: i

11:37:13
thdxr: adams body is deteriorating

11:37:15
<transcript>: I see the little sparkles fly through the air.

11:37:15
<transcript>: that's new

11:37:18
<transcript>: That's new. It was not the case.

11:37:20
<transcript>: If you want to be successful.

11:37:20
<transcript>: you don't

11:37:22
<transcript>: You don't apparently. Yeah. Don't get.

11:37:22
<transcript>: a job

11:37:25
vapor__dev: what happens if you say uruguay

11:37:26
<transcript>: A job. The side door. What's next? Call it the side door.

11:37:30
<transcript>: Sibukate, welcome to my chat, welcome.

11:37:30
<transcript>: on

11:37:43
<transcript>: On a Wednesday morning, bright and early 06:37 a.m.. We got new chatters. How's your experience with elixir? What would you advise for beginners? So I'm not a huge.

11:37:43
<transcript>: not

11:37:43
lesabotsy: @thdxr true, being a mod for a scammer is not a job

11:37:45
<transcript>: Not a huge elixir developer.

11:37:50
<transcript>: I've had to work on it.

11:37:50
<transcript>: just

11:37:59
<transcript>: Just because that's what one of our developers was really into. Elixir wanted to work on it more and got a job at sap, muse and decided this is going to be elixir.

11:38:01
<transcript>: So.

11:38:06
cowfacedev: Do you guys upload aws.fm on google podcasts? I can't find anything beyond ep 33 @thdxr @adamdotdev

11:38:18
thdxr: tomorrow.fm is our new podcast

11:38:21
<transcript>: I have figured out what I needed to figure out to help move this code base forward, but I wouldn't call myself like an elixir developer. I guess I wouldn't call myself an anything developer. I just sort of work on whatever I have to work on. But if I'm anything these days, I'm probably more of like a typescript developer just messing around in elixir, but it's been fine.

11:38:26
<transcript>: The lsp is really slow. I don't fault the lsp because.

11:38:26
<transcript>: i've only ever worked

11:38:42
<transcript>: I've only ever worked in this elixir code base. And it is giant. Well, it's like, look, I mean, it's giant. It's a giant code base. I wonder how many lines of elixir code. This is just like the ones that I have expanded. I mean, every one of these directories has stuff in it.

11:38:46
vapor__dev: !tomorrow

11:38:46
fossabot: Adam has a podcast with Dax Raad (@thdxr) where they talk about the future of everything: https://tomorrow.fm

11:38:48
<transcript>: It's a very large code base. Right. So I think that's why my lsp is so slow.

11:38:48
<transcript>: i don't know

11:38:49
<transcript>: I don't know.

11:38:49
<transcript>: it's not type

11:38:53
<transcript>: It's not Typed, so it's not type language. If you're coming from typescript.

11:38:53
<transcript>: there's that

11:38:54
<transcript>: There's that.

11:39:02
rustafarian_dev: What is your editor?

11:39:03
<transcript>: Otherwise that's been an interesting. It's fun. Like the pattern matching and all that I get the appeal of functional programming. I don't understand.

11:39:03
<transcript>: the

11:39:06
thdxr: very large codebase for a very large man

11:39:09
nikolaxhristov: have you tried Gleam?

11:39:14
<transcript>: The religious zealotry over it that some people get, but I get it. It's fun. It's nice. It makes my brain feel kind of different when I do it, as opposed to.

11:39:14
<transcript>: writing a bunch of

11:39:15
cowfacedev: Oh. You guys moved...

11:39:24
<transcript>: Writing a bunch of typescript. Okay, Alan, are you doing everything in typescript going forward? Yeah. So, I mean, the astro site. We're rewriting in an intro. It's all typescript.

11:39:24
<transcript>: i mean

11:39:24
lesabotsy: @rustafarian_dev it's neovim

11:39:37
rustafarian_dev: Thanks

11:39:41
<transcript>: I mean, all the ssc stuff, obviously typescript. Yeah, it's a big giant typescript code base then. I mean, we still have the natural language processing stuff, the nlp service gamera. That's not typescript. And we're not rewriting that unless Chad gpt just makes it possible to be like, Hey.

11:39:41
<transcript>: we're

11:39:51
<transcript>: We're going to use openai's api now, and we don't need to have a big custom code base. I don't think that's true, but it does feel like there's something we could maybe do there. I don't know.

11:39:56
<transcript>: Dazd, thank you for that follow. I appreciate your follow.

11:40:00
<transcript>: Curious. What are you migrating to? I think I just answered that. Darren.

11:40:00
<transcript>: allen

11:40:03
<transcript>: Allen. Same. Welcome to Chat. I think.

11:40:03
<transcript>: i just answer

11:40:24
<transcript>: I just answered that question. We got two allens now and they both spell their name A L A N. I've never seen that spelling of Alan. I guess I'm making a lot of assumptions that the new Allen, Alan lazzie, who has joined our chat. Welcome. By the way, Alan, I'm assuming that's your name Allen, that your name is Alan lazzie. If it is you and vapor dev have the same first name. Spe.

11:40:24
<transcript>: spelling

11:40:29
<transcript>: Spelling and everything. It's kind of cool. I'm interviewing your company. You just don't know it yet.

11:40:29
<transcript>: first

11:40:47
laame: The perfectly aligned candy-bar is a nice youch... mua

11:40:49
<transcript>: First I come from management, accounting background. Cool. First job in Tech lesa. It's a great industry. Really great. It's fun getting paid like a doctor without all the schooling or liabilities bodie Ha just did my 7th apps stripe integration of the weekend gets quicker every time I've done it several times and I will say.

11:40:57
<transcript>: It does get easier when you already kind of know all the things you got to deal with, but it doesn't make it less like.

11:40:57
<transcript>: i

11:41:01
<transcript>: I got to do stripe integration, just like a lot of stuff.

11:41:06
<transcript>: Seems to me as long as elixir can read the state.

11:41:08
aisebaxp: Hiiii adamdevDealWithIt

11:41:10
<transcript>: Adam's body is deteriorating. Is that what the spit is.

11:41:23
<transcript>: So what happens if you say yorguay? Did I say it right? I'll never remember. I don't say it enough. I mean, I guess now I've been saying it a lot because you guys keep making me say it, but you are gwe. Uruguay.

11:41:23
<transcript>: which

11:41:26
<transcript>: Which one? Which one is it neither.

11:41:26
<transcript>: being a mod

11:41:42
<transcript>: Being a mod for a scammer is not a job cafe. So you guys upload aws FM on Google podcast. I can't find anything beyond episode 33 we don't do aws FM anymore Calface. We just rebranded and broadened the scope to be tomorrow FM.

11:41:43
bodhihawken: Ye im at the point with stripe integrations where i do the bare minimum, stripe pricing table, 4 webhooks, done XD

11:41:48
yodavido: oo-roo-goo-why

11:41:48
<transcript>: So how about tomorrow? That is the successor to aws FM.

11:41:48
<transcript>: oh dax

11:41:51
<transcript>: Oh, dax already said that I'm going to stop talking.

11:41:51
<transcript>: i'm so

11:41:51
vapor__dev: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/En-us-Uruguay-1.ogg

11:41:53
<transcript>: I'm so behind.

11:42:07
<transcript>: Ras Safari. And my editor is Neil vim. Very large code base for a very large man. What's that supposed to mean? Have you tried gleam? I have not everyone keeps talking about gleam. Feel like gleam is the thing I need to look at. Apparently.

11:42:17
<transcript>: You guys moved? Yes. Tomorrow. Fm. That's right. Okay. And lesa answered that. It's Neovim. I have now contributed nothing to this conversation.

11:42:25
<transcript>: I'm going to go take a break. You guys got it from here. People are going to ask questions. You're going to answer them. I don't really need to be here. I could just be working, I guess.

11:42:25
<transcript>: the perfectly

11:42:26
foobfoob: I need to write a simple internal app. Two forms/pages with some validation/loading/saving. Usually I would use Go+vanilla-JS or fullstack-next.js, but I'm not sure if this is too bloated? Any recommendations?

11:42:37
<transcript>: The perfectly lined candy bar is a nice touch. Yeah, I'm kind of OCPD, I don't know if I'm actually so don't come at me if you're like. I'm actually OCPD and it bothers me when people say they are. I think I am.

11:42:37
<transcript>: i think i have

11:42:41
<transcript>: I think I have obsessive compulsive Personality Disorder. My wife is pretty sure.

11:42:41
<transcript>: but

11:42:44
<transcript>: But I'm not clinically diagnosed.

11:42:44
<transcript>: i'm sorry

11:42:46
<transcript>: I'm sorry.

11:42:46
<transcript>: i'm probably not

11:42:52
<transcript>: I'm probably not going to get clinically diagnosed. I'm just going to go with the unofficial diagnosis. Seba is here.

11:43:03
<transcript>: Bodie. I'm at the point with stripe integrations where I do the bare minimum stripe pricing table for webhooks done. Yeah, it's just so much. I just wish I didn't have to do all that.

11:43:05
<transcript>: Okay.

11:43:08
<transcript>: Uruguay. What? Are you? Serious.

11:43:09
schrew: Gm!

11:43:21
yodavido: there you go

11:43:28
<transcript>: Why that's not wait. Uruguay. Uruguay. Uruguay? Yeah, yeah, I remember now. I need to write a simple shrews here. Good morning. Shrew. Need to write a simple internal app, two forms, pages, and some validation Loading saving. Usually I would use good go plus vanilla.

11:43:28
<transcript>: js or full

11:43:41
kryotoboi: Why am I always late to this stream ?

11:43:41
<transcript>: Js or full sac next js, but I'm not sure if this is too bloated any recommendations, so it's internal and it's two forms with some validation Loading man. The worst part of building an app is.

11:43:41
<transcript>: formed

11:43:45
<transcript>: Formed and validation all of that part.

11:43:47
tymekdev: Getting payments integrated is what scares me when it comes to creating some kind of product

11:43:48

11:43:48
<transcript>: gpt

11:43:54
<transcript>: Gpt Four. I'm just kidding. But, man, I do hope something about the AI.

11:43:54
<transcript>: stuff

11:44:05
bodhihawken: if your building a bunch of internal stuff, use Retool, it saves me a bunch of time

11:44:05
<transcript>: Stuff that's happening makes it where I don't have to make forms anymore. That would be amazing. I hate making forms. I don't know if I have a strong opinion here about what would be the easiest thing. I mean, I guess.

11:44:05
<transcript>: whatever

11:44:10
<transcript>: Whatever you're fastest with whatever you use the most is what I would use.

11:44:10
<transcript>: so

11:44:13
<transcript>: So I use a lot of next JS. I probably build it with next JS.

11:44:14
thdxr: in Bumi we're layer a gpt layer to auto fill out complex forms

11:44:15
rustafarian_dev: Have a good rest of the day. Got to go drop the kids off

11:44:18
kryotoboi: Forms are sexy

11:44:20
<transcript>: Have its internal. That's probably what I would do. There you go, there you go.

11:44:20
<transcript>: why am i

11:44:25
laame: my whole work is making super complex form :(

11:44:28
<transcript>: Why am I always late to the stream cryle? You're not that late. I started 25 minutes ago and only 15 minutes of that. Have I been talking.

11:44:28
<transcript>: feels like

11:44:31
thdxr: still have to build the form though

11:44:36
<transcript>: Feels like forever. Probably to everyone on this stream that I've been talking. Getting payments integrated is what scares me when it comes to creating some kind of product.

11:44:36
<transcript>: it's really not

11:44:42
<transcript>: It's really not scary. It's like the boilerplate thing. It's like working with Redux.

11:44:46
<transcript>: Just like, why do I have to type so much and do so many different things.

11:44:46
<transcript>: that's what

11:44:52
<transcript>: That's what payments is. If you're building a bunch of internal stuff, use retool. It saves me a bunch of time. I've heard of those things.

11:44:55
<transcript>: I've heard of this.

11:44:56
<transcript>: In boomi.

11:44:57
thdxr: Adam is after redux these days

11:45:02
<transcript>: A gpt layer to auto fill the complex forms. Wait.

11:45:11
<transcript>: In boomi, we're layer a gbt layer layering in a Gbt layer to auto fill out complex forms that's pretty cool.

11:45:13
thdxr: we're adding a gpt layer*

11:45:19
<transcript>: Have a good rest of the day we'll see arrest of our end I hope you come back enjoyed your company go drop those kids off.

11:45:38
<transcript>: My whole work is making super complex forms. I really don't like it. Still have to build the form, though. Adam is after redux. He says we're adding a gpt layer. Got you. That's cool. Dex. I'd love to hear how that goes with adding gbd to an existing app. Okay, so here's the thing.

11:45:42
<transcript>: I need to now stand up. So I have this other.

11:45:48
<transcript>: I have this other.

11:45:51
<transcript>: Let's do it right here.

11:45:53
<transcript>: Code.

11:45:57
<transcript>: Atmus.com. I have.

11:45:57
<transcript>: this

11:45:58
<transcript>: This.

11:46:02
<transcript>: This code base is SST.

11:46:06
<transcript>: It's. What? The rewrite? Where I'm doing? The rewrite.

11:46:10
<transcript>: But I don't know.

11:46:20
<transcript>: I want to start building out stripe in here. Yeah. This is where it'll be. So I start building it on in here, okay. Yeah. I've got a repo then.

11:46:20
<transcript>: let's see

11:46:22
<transcript>: Let's see.

11:46:29
<transcript>: So the other thing I need to figure out is how I'm going to do query limiting.

11:46:29
thdxr: I'd suggest keeping it one repo and is it already a monorepo?

11:46:34
<transcript>: Not query limiting, but a result limiting. So if I say.

11:46:35
thdxr: or did you do drop in mode

11:46:38
<transcript>: Let's see here.

11:46:40
<transcript>: Just Loading it all up again.

11:46:45
<transcript>: You'd suggest keeping in one repo? And is it already a mono repo.

11:46:45
<transcript>: well

11:46:46
<transcript>: Well.

11:46:46
<transcript>: or did

11:46:50
<transcript>: Or did you do drop in mode? No, I'm saying.

11:46:54
<transcript>: This repo is the Giant elixir repo. Right.

11:46:56
<transcript>: That's what this thing is.

11:46:56
<transcript>: this is

11:47:00
<transcript>: This is mothra. It's just this giant, existing.

11:47:00
<transcript>: elixir

11:47:01
kryotoboi: This how I explain things to my manager "So I have this the other... hmm.. ahhh...hmm... So I have this other.... Okay .. sure "

11:47:02
thdxr: I meant the new Astro stuff

11:47:07
thdxr: Astro SST stuff

11:47:11
<transcript>: Elixir repo. But I'm saying I've already created a mono repo for the new astro stuff. Yeah, it's a mono repo. I started it with ssd. Yeah.

11:47:11
<transcript>: so that's

11:47:15
<transcript>: So that's where I'm going to build all the stripe stuff. And then I'm just going to have to figure out.

11:47:22
<transcript>: I guess I got to think about how okay it's going to talk to the same database. So I'm just going to.

11:47:22
<transcript>: write like i'm

11:47:28
<transcript>: Write like I'm going to update the user record or whatever in the database. This postgres database to say.

11:47:37
<transcript>: This thing is now a paid user, right? And then through webhooks. I can update it to say it's not whatever that kind of thing.

11:47:39
<transcript>: Then the question is.

11:47:46
<transcript>: So then when the session, I kind of need to invalidate the session.

11:47:46
<transcript>: too

11:47:51
<transcript>: Too. So I think I need to store that they're subscribed in the session. I don't know. I'm getting ahead of myself.

11:47:53
<transcript>: Okay.

11:47:59
<transcript>: This is how I explained things to my manager. So I have this other.

11:48:05
foobfoob: is astro a viable choice for interactive stuff or is it more used for generating/marketing pages?

11:48:08
<transcript>: Okay. Sure. Yeah. No. Same. My brain is like having a hard time right now. Okay. I don't actually like this.

11:48:08
<transcript>: being

11:48:10
<transcript>: Being down here.

11:48:10
<transcript>: so

11:48:13
<transcript>: So what I'm going to do is do.

11:48:13
<transcript>: a vertical

11:48:15
<transcript>: A vertical split here. Yeah.

11:48:18
<transcript>: And then.

11:48:18
<transcript>: in vimit okay

11:48:21
<transcript>: In Vimit. Okay. So I've got my two repos here.

11:48:23
oleksii_lisovyi: wazuuuuuup!

11:48:41
<transcript>: Okay, so before I go over to the ssc side. Alaski, what's up? What's going on? Is astro a viable choice for interactive stuffers at more use for generating marketing pages. Yeah. Satmus.com very uninteractive. Not a lot of client side interactivity if you're building.

11:48:41
<transcript>: a very

11:48:41
jaythedeveloper: ayo, here for the macbook giveaway scam LUL

11:48:47
<transcript>: A very rich front end app like a spa. Especially don't use astro. It's not for that.

11:48:47
<transcript>: it's like

11:48:49
<transcript>: It's like PHP.

11:48:52
<transcript>: You can drop in front end frameworks.

11:48:57
<transcript>: So maybe in the future the Astro story is like just use it for everything.

11:49:03
<transcript>: And then choose your front end framework of choice because it has the whole Islands interactivity thing.

11:49:07
<transcript>: Aoj Here for the macbook. Giveaway scan.

11:49:12
oleksii_lisovyi: i write php BTW

11:49:14
<transcript>: What sucks about dx convincing everybody it's a scam. Is that now people there's probably people that actually believe it's a scam.

11:49:16
jaythedeveloper: 170 points away

11:49:22
<transcript>: And they're not going to be excited and they're not going to potentially win because they're not going to redeem it because they're just going to think it's a scam.

11:49:22
<transcript>: they're losing

11:49:25
<transcript>: They're losing out on that opportunity.

11:49:25
vapor__dev: this is what a scammer would say

11:49:25
tymekdev: @foobfoob Theo has a good video summarizing what he'd recommend based on project you are going to use it for: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7X6fLbdwlc

11:49:31
<transcript>: Alexi, you write php by the way, I wish I wrote php half the time. Laravel seems very enticing.

11:49:31
<transcript>: this is

11:49:31
thdxr: it is a scam

11:49:34
<transcript>: This is what a scammer would say.

11:49:34
<transcript>: theo

11:49:39
foobfoob: thanks, will have a look!

11:49:42
<transcript>: Theo has a good video summarizing what he'd recommend based on project you're going to use it for. Oh, like whether you should use Astro versus something else.

11:49:45
<transcript>: That's cool. Okay.

11:49:47
<transcript>: So here's the thing.

11:49:50
oleksii_lisovyi: and what's more important not follow the channel

11:49:53
<transcript>: You're going to be on this page.

11:49:53
<transcript>: you're going to

11:49:53
thdxr: that video is definitely overkill

11:49:56
<transcript>: You're going to search most points in a game.

11:50:03
<transcript>: And the question is okay. So that says because I'm not logged in.

11:50:06
thdxr: for what you want to do

11:50:07
<transcript>: Now what I'm going to do, okay. I wanted to test this.

11:50:07
<transcript>: if i

11:50:09
<transcript>: If I clear.

11:50:14
nexxeln: okay bye i have an exam tomorrow PepeHands

11:50:19
thdxr: honestly a simple Astro site is probably good for a simple tool

11:50:20
<transcript>: I'm going to find out real quick how we track visitors. If I clear all those cookies and everything else, and then I go back and I say most points in a game.

11:50:23
<transcript>: Does it know I'm still the same person.

11:50:27
<transcript>: It does not.

11:50:27
<transcript>: okay so

11:50:31
<transcript>: Okay. So the visitor tracking does rely on cookies like browser, state stuff.

11:50:37
<transcript>: And once you clear that you've got a new set of downs, so to speak.

11:50:37
<transcript>: in football

11:50:39
<transcript>: In Football, parlance.

11:50:44
<transcript>: Okay, bye. I have an exam tomorrow. Goodbye. Next.

11:50:44
<transcript>: i didn't even

11:50:50
<transcript>: I didn't even know you were here. Hi. And goodbye. I miss you already.

11:50:52
<transcript>: For what you want to do.

11:50:57
<transcript>: Honestly a simple astroce. Probably good for a simple tool.

11:50:57
<transcript>: that video

11:51:00
thdxr: https://twitter.com/thdxr/status/1645994908757393408?t=9pdjzJMdN_u9id13WOYLPw&s=19

11:51:01
<transcript>: That video is definitely overkill. And what's more important not follow the channel.

11:51:01
<transcript>: what

11:51:02
<transcript>: What.

11:51:02
<transcript>: did i miss

11:51:06
<transcript>: Did I miss? And what's more important, not follow the channel.

11:51:16
<transcript>: So.

11:51:18
vapor__dev: why is statmuse logo an elephant

11:51:19
oleksii_lisovyi: that was about the macbook scam

11:51:27
<transcript>: I'm a little. Oh, dax, what's this suite? You just queuing that up for later, or do I need to open it right now? Why is Status logo an elephant? Great question.

11:51:27
<transcript>: actually

11:51:28
<transcript>: Actually.

11:51:28
<transcript>: the original

11:51:31
<transcript>: The original Satmus logo.

11:51:35
<transcript>: That was the original.

11:51:37
<transcript>: This is it.

11:51:38
oleksii_lisovyi: cause of PHP of course

11:51:43
<transcript>: My wife made that logo. And then when I was gone, they turned it into an elephant. I.

11:51:43
<transcript>: think

11:51:48
<transcript>: Think it's because elephants have like, did it have a really good memory or something.

11:51:52
<transcript>: Is that a thing about elephants.

11:52:02
<transcript>: Anybody now I think elephants have like a really good memory or something. This is really fascinating to see all the images that come up when I search stamus.

11:52:05
<transcript>: A lot of player illustrations.

11:52:08
vapor__dev: oo

11:52:10
vapor__dev: makes sense

11:52:12
<transcript>: Yeah, it's an elephant now.

11:52:12
<transcript>: i think it's because

11:52:19
<transcript>: I think it's because elephants have good memory. And like Sat muse has a good brain. I don't know. Something like that. Maybe.

11:52:20
oleksii_lisovyi: yeah, elephants have NVMe memory – aktually good one

11:52:21
thdxr: that's not an elephant....

11:52:23
<transcript>: So do I, like.

11:52:23
<transcript>: that you can just

11:52:24
<transcript>: That you can just.

11:52:27
<transcript>: Clear your thing.

11:52:30
<transcript>: I don't know. How do we feel about that.

11:52:30
<transcript>: it is an

11:52:33
<transcript>: It is an elephant. What are you talking about, dax? It's an elephant.

11:52:35
joshnerd557: Forgive me, I’m new here - are you an NBA head? Excited for playoffs?

11:52:37
<transcript>: Elephants Have nvme memory.

11:52:46
<transcript>: Are you an NBA head excited for playoffs? So, Josh, I used to be. I used to be a big NBA nerd.

11:52:48
<transcript>: At some point during.

11:52:48
<transcript>: the sap

11:52:52
<transcript>: The sap muse. Heyday, I was there for five years. At some point.

11:52:52
<transcript>: it just kind of

11:52:55
<transcript>: It just kind of lost its luster to me. I don't know why.

11:52:58
vapor__dev: @thdxr https://img.gifglobe.com/grabs/montypython/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail/gif/c655FTkR7zrV.gif

11:52:59
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't know.

11:52:59
<transcript>: here's

11:53:03
<transcript>: Here's what I think. I think I used to be a really big NBA fan.

11:53:03
<transcript>: and then

11:53:16
<transcript>: And then as we built, samus and I had no more time. I really didn't have time to watch anymore. And if you're not watching the NBA from afar, it's pretty like, I don't know. The drama of it is pretty like I just don't care.

11:53:16
<transcript>: i'm not invested

11:53:18
vapor__dev: his favorite sport is twitter dunking

11:53:24
<transcript>: I'm not invested in the players each year coming out of the draft or whatever. I haven't kept up with it. I think I got too busy building stat, muse.

11:53:24
<transcript>: and then

11:53:31
<transcript>: And then like Patrick mahomes came to the Chiefs in the NFL, and I got kind of into that because that's like my hometown team.

11:53:31
<transcript>: so i'm kind of

11:53:33
joshnerd557: I’ll say it… James Harden it’s ok

11:53:43
<transcript>: So I'm kind of a Chiefs homer. And it got fun following the Chiefs, and I think I literally have zero capacity to have two sports that I care about. So I care about the Chiefs in the NFL now.

11:53:45
<transcript>: I don't know.

11:53:45
<transcript>: james

11:53:48
alanlazzy: as im new here, maybe a dumb question, but do you fetch this data in a public API?

11:53:52
<transcript>: James Harden is okay. So I will say I'm enough of an NBA fan to not like James Harden.

11:54:06
fragaverage: FOUND YOU

11:54:06
<transcript>: He was one of my least favorite players when I was really into the NBA, just. I hate this style of play. I just hate it and that he doesn't show up in the playoffs, just like the get foul jump into people, that whole thing. I just.

11:54:09
<transcript>: Not a fan.

11:54:19
<transcript>: I'm new here. Maybe a dumb question, but do you fetch this data in a public api? So Alan frag is here. He found me my favorite sports, Twitter docking.

11:54:19
<transcript>: what

11:54:22
<transcript>: What is this link? Alan pasted.

11:54:22
<transcript>: the

11:54:23
<transcript>: The.

11:54:23
<transcript>: api

11:54:26
<transcript>: Api the data comes from I really need a data command.

11:54:26
<transcript>: no ord

11:54:29
<transcript>: No ordinary rabbit.

11:54:29
<transcript>: i need

11:54:29
yodavido: same thing happened to me as I got into euro league soccer. My son got me into soccer and now I just check box scores and watch playoff nba.

11:54:33
<transcript>: I need a data command. Fauci bot. I'm going to answer you as I write.

11:54:33
<transcript>: this command

11:54:35
<transcript>: This command.

11:54:40
<transcript>: Because I say this every stream multiple times data.

11:54:42
<transcript>: So.

11:54:42
<transcript>: we

11:54:43
<transcript>: We.

11:54:43
<transcript>: get our

11:54:45
<transcript>: Get our Semus.

11:54:53
<transcript>: Gets real time data. Actually, there might be a page on the site. There might actually be a page on the site that talks about our data.

11:54:53
<transcript>: maybe

11:54:55
<transcript>: Maybe not.

11:55:00
<transcript>: Products.

11:55:02
<transcript>: I guess not.

11:55:02
<transcript>: wait

11:55:04
<transcript>: Wait.

11:55:04
<transcript>: glossary

11:55:08
<transcript>: Glossary. Is there like a glossary data and glossary.

11:55:09
<transcript>: Here you go.

11:55:19
joshnerd557: Haha awesome, patty Mahomes is a wonder to watch - same feeling for me as watching 15-16 Curry

11:55:20
<transcript>: So we get our in season data, like our real time data from Sport Radar. But all this stuff, our historical coverage, our historical data.

11:55:24
<transcript>: Is from like a we hire.

11:55:24
<transcript>: a stat

11:55:29

<transcript>: But all the historical data.

11:55:32
sj_se: how will you sell access to statmuse data? pay by the month or year?

11:55:34
<transcript>: Was built.

11:55:34
<transcript>: or

11:55:35
oleksii_lisovyi: btw do you know that there is a brand caparol with another elephant – just fun fact

11:55:36

11:56:26
<transcript>: maybe

11:56:33
<transcript>: Maybe I'll do like stats now. Okay. Data done. There you go.

11:56:35
adamdotdev: !data

11:56:35
fossabot: StatMuse gets real-time data from SportRadar, but all the historical data was collected by Justin Kubatko, creator of Basketball-Reference.com, who worked as the lead statistician for Statmuse for several years. Read more here: https://www.statmuse.com/product/data

11:56:36
<transcript>: There you go.

11:56:36
<transcript>: data

11:56:37
<transcript>: Data.

11:56:37
<transcript>: it works

11:56:40
<transcript>: It works. That's a big old wall of text. Okay.

11:56:43
thdxr: what does the statmuse codebase smell like?

11:56:48
<transcript>: Now I'm really bothered by the fact that you can just clear your browser cache.

11:56:50
<transcript>: And.

11:56:50
<transcript>: what

11:56:53
<transcript>: What is sammy code base. Smell like.

11:56:53
<transcript>: i don't

11:56:54
<transcript>: I don't know.

11:56:58
<transcript>: It's got kind of a sweaty smell. Sports. I don't know.

11:56:58
<transcript>: same thing

11:57:07
thdxr: Adam don't get sucked into the paywall hack get it working first!

11:57:11
<transcript>: Same thing happened to me as I got into Euro League Soccer. My son got me into soccer, and now I just check box scores and watch playoff NBA. Yeah, it's hard to track two sports. I feel like I have capacity as a human being to care about one sport.

11:57:18
thdxr: can do something smarter (more annoying) later

11:57:23
<transcript>: Patty mahomes is a wonder to watch same feeling for me as watching 15 to 16 Curry. Same and that's when I was into the NBA, would have been back in curry's. I mean, he's still good, but like his Prime Prime.

11:57:23
<transcript>: and

11:57:29
<transcript>: And that's exactly how I felt when Pat mahomes came to the NFL. It just changed the League. It just felt like.

11:57:29
<transcript>: this is different

11:57:35
<transcript>: This is different. We never seen anything like it. Just like I felt watching steph Curry. Such an apt analogy.

11:57:35
<transcript>: how are you so

11:57:40
<transcript>: How are you? So access to sammy's Data pay by the month or year. I think we'll probably offer both.

11:57:40
<transcript>: i

11:57:44
<transcript>: I think have an annual option probably.

11:57:52
<transcript>: But definitely a monthly option. By the way, do you know, we also talked about a one time purchase. We talked about it maybe like a lifetime thing.

11:57:52
<transcript>: talked about it

11:57:57
<transcript>: Talked about it. By the way, do you know that there is a brand.

11:57:57
<transcript>: capirol

11:58:02
<transcript>: Capirol with another elephant. Just fun fact. I did not know that another elephant brand.

11:58:02
<transcript>: i think

11:58:09
<transcript>: I think there's some other elephant brands. I just can't remember. Don't get sucked into the paywall hack. Get it working first. Okay.

11:58:09
<transcript>: can

11:58:09
vyste: I mean.. if you want to track someones session even when they delete it, you'll need to be able to identify them through other means... time to write a supercookie?

11:58:14
<transcript>: Can be something smarter. More annoying later. Okay, good callbacks. Good call.

11:58:14
<transcript>: visty

11:58:31
<transcript>: Visty. Welcome to Chat. I mean, if you want to track someone's session, even when they delete it, you'll need to be able to identify them through other means. Time to ride a super cookie. Yeah, we'll get into that. We'll get into it later. For now. This is fine. This is fine. We're going to give a lot of value to those who sign up.

11:58:31
<transcript>: there's talk

11:58:36
<transcript>: There's talk of a lot of other things. We're going to offer access to a private slack.

11:58:36
<transcript>: where

11:58:36
oleksii_lisovyi: "subscribe to have 0.01% chance to win a macbook" luxury tier

11:58:46
<transcript>: Where you can whatever with us or discord. Sorry. Not slack. There's going to be other reasons to subscribe, so whatever. Okay, but what I do need to figure out is how I want to limit.

11:58:46
<transcript>: these

11:58:56
<transcript>: These results because right here you get like, what, 1234-5678? I think it's 25. You get 25 results. And we're going to clamp that off.

11:58:56
<transcript>: at like ten

11:59:00
<transcript>: At like ten results if you're not a paid user.

11:59:00
<transcript>: okay

11:59:01
<transcript>: Okay.

11:59:04
<transcript>: So I need to figure that out now.

11:59:07
<transcript>: Can query.

11:59:12
<transcript>: Enforcer is going to have another method.

11:59:21
<transcript>: And this method is going to be.

11:59:25
<transcript>: What just happened.

11:59:26
<transcript>: It's going to be.

11:59:31
<transcript>: Submit query. Let's see.

11:59:39
<transcript>: Should result.

11:59:42
<transcript>: The.

11:59:47
<transcript>: Interesting. I guess it's just if.

11:59:47
<transcript>: they're not paid

11:59:48
<transcript>: They're not paid.

11:59:51
<transcript>: Well, let's just do this.

11:59:51
<transcript>: get current

11:59:53
<transcript>: Get current user.

11:59:58
<transcript>: So can query is a little different.

11:59:58
<transcript>: is user

11:59:59
<transcript>: Is user.

12:00:04
<transcript>: Is.

12:00:08
<transcript>: Just a paid user I don't know.

12:00:18
<transcript>: Get current user if user I'm going to just return false for now. Oh not return just went typescript on it false.

12:00:20
<transcript>: Otherwise.

12:00:20
<transcript>: there

12:00:24
<transcript>: There is no user. We check visitor. Well, it's definitely false.

12:00:30
oleksii_lisovyi: gotta go. have fun mr. streamer and chat 07

12:00:32
<transcript>: Yeah. So it'll only be true in cases where user like we have we're going to have, like, a paid user thing or something.

12:00:37
<transcript>: Yeah.

12:00:37
<transcript>: see alex

12:00:38
<transcript>: See Alexey.

12:00:38
<transcript>: we'll see you

12:00:40
<transcript>: We'll see you next time.

12:00:43
<transcript>: It's nice having you.

12:00:48
<transcript>: Yg thank you so much. Follow. I'm sorry I missed it. I missed your follow.

12:00:54
<transcript>: Okay. So this is not going to be canquery. This is going to be.

12:01:00
<transcript>: Is paid.

12:01:02
<transcript>: User.

12:01:04
<transcript>: Maybe.

12:01:04
<transcript>: this

12:01:11
<transcript>: This paid user. Should this belong in the enforcers thing? Maybe not. I don't know, but here we can just say.

12:01:15
<transcript>: User. How would I want to do this.

12:01:25
<transcript>: Don't add condition so this matches top level match elixir people elixir nerds. I could do like a nested thing where I say case.

12:01:25
<transcript>: is

12:01:27
<transcript>: Is paid user.

12:01:34
<transcript>: Like that.

12:01:38
<transcript>: Do and then I could say, like, true.

12:01:45
<transcript>: False. But I feel like there's a way I could do this. That's better.

12:01:46
thdxr: use with?

12:01:47
<transcript>: Oh, wait, no.

12:01:48
thdxr: I think

12:01:53
<transcript>: This would actually be here. And this would be true.

12:01:57
<transcript>: Like what's a better way to write this.

12:02:03
<transcript>: Use width. What's with oh, on this same right here. It'll be like.

12:02:03
<transcript>: width

12:02:05
<transcript>: Width or something.

12:02:05
<transcript>: or it'd be

12:02:07
<transcript>: Or it'd be right here.

12:02:07
<transcript>: with

12:02:08
<transcript>: With is.

12:02:12
<transcript>: Paid? Is this what you're saying.

12:02:18
<transcript>: To me.

12:02:24
<transcript>: And I guess I should have a paid user thing where I can pass user to.

12:02:24
<transcript>: like

12:02:26
<transcript>: Like this.

12:02:29
thdxr: look up with

12:02:34
<transcript>: User with is paid user look up with.

12:02:34
<transcript>: or like

12:02:41
<transcript>: Or like actually just look it up on yeah, sorry I shouldn't make you type everything elixir with statement.

12:02:46
<transcript>: So there's lots of uses in here. Let's just do this.

12:02:48
<transcript>: With.

12:02:48
kryotoboi: Does all backend for statmuse use Elixir ?

12:02:55
<transcript>: Not I thought there was.

12:02:58
<transcript>: Well, rip.

12:03:07
<transcript>: I keep going? Oh, here we go with.

12:03:09
<transcript>: Sound.

12:03:11
<transcript>: Oh, here we go.

12:03:14
<transcript>: So.

12:03:14
<transcript>: with

12:03:16
<transcript>: With.

12:03:26
<transcript>: All back in for sat mezu's, elixir. No, just the back end for our front end.

12:03:29
<transcript>: Just the BFF.

12:03:32
<transcript>: With and then else.

12:03:37
<transcript>: Has this work.

12:03:45
<transcript>: So with maybe insert contact.

12:03:51
<transcript>: I don't understand that. Let's look at the. Let's look at this.

12:04:02
<transcript>: Promise this approach. Every function change is handle the case where any function before it return an error error. Let's rewrite our code. Okay.

12:04:02
<transcript>: with

12:04:04
<transcript>: With parse dob.

12:04:04
<transcript>: harsh

12:04:06
<transcript>: Harsh name.

12:04:06
<transcript>: do

12:04:07
<transcript>: Do.

12:04:07
<transcript>: else

12:04:10
<transcript>: Else oh so.

12:04:10
<transcript>: like

12:04:13
<transcript>: Like with and then get the user and then.

12:04:13
<transcript>: if there is

12:04:16
<transcript>: If there is a user, it'll do the next thing if there's not.

12:04:19
<transcript>: Is that what you're saying to me.

12:04:24
eikster_dk: Do you have a team behind statemuse or are you running it by yourself?

12:04:31
<transcript>: I think. Yeah. Executed. An order. Execution comes as long as left, right match. As soon as the match fails, the elsebox is executed. Perfect.

12:04:44
<transcript>: Eichster. Do you have a team behind status or are you running it by yourself? There is a team at our peak. We were like 25, I think now we're just like ten.

12:04:49
<transcript>: But, yeah, we have a team. Okay. So instead of this being a top level case statement.

12:04:52
<transcript>: Instead of that, it's going to be.

12:04:59
thdxr: I'm the team behind statmuse

12:04:59
terawatthour: is the `maybe_` prefix in function names standard in elixir world?

12:05:01
<transcript>: With up here right.

12:05:03
<transcript>: With.

12:05:08
<transcript>: Just wrote it for me.

12:05:10
<transcript>: With user.

12:05:17
<transcript>: Do that.

12:05:20
<transcript>: I can add.

12:05:20
<transcript>: additional

12:05:22
<transcript>: Additional is paid user.

12:05:27
thdxr: yeah

12:05:28
<transcript>: I can say.

12:05:37
<transcript>: Does the Maybe prefix and function name standard in elixir world? Oh, yeah, dex is the team behind status.

12:05:40
<transcript>: So then here I'm going to say.

12:05:46
<transcript>: Is paid.

12:05:46
<transcript>: equ

12:05:48
<transcript>: Equals.

12:05:50
<transcript>: Is paid user.

12:06:01
<transcript>: But I'm going to have this as an option since I already got it out of the okay so is paid user.

12:06:07
<transcript>: Width. And then that okay.

12:06:07
<transcript>: yeah

12:06:08
foobfoob: thdxr, do you write elixir sometimes? I had the impression you are full on TS

12:06:09
<transcript>: Yeah. And then.

12:06:09
<transcript>: do

12:06:10
<transcript>: Do.

12:06:14
<transcript>: So what's? It not like here.

12:06:19
<transcript>: Oh yeah I got to add is paid user down here.

12:06:19
<transcript>: so

12:06:22
<transcript>: So we're going to have an overload.

12:06:32
thdxr: I did elixir for five years

12:06:34
<transcript>: I don't know if they're called overloads I'll be honest but is paid user with the connection. Let's see this is going to be user.

12:06:38
<transcript>: And then.

12:06:40
<transcript>: It's just going to be.

12:06:44
thdxr: TS is actually newer for me

12:06:46
<transcript>: For now just false. It will check on something in the user.

12:06:46
<transcript>: and then

12:06:51
<transcript>: And then this is going to be case. Get current user.

12:06:56
<transcript>: Then return is paid user.

12:06:56
<transcript>: user

12:06:57
<transcript>: User.

12:07:01
<transcript>: Else false. Okay.

12:07:08
foobfoob: Why did you switch? because of SST?

12:07:10
<transcript>: It's like, way behind. Okay, here it goes.

12:07:15
<transcript>: I'll appease it for now.

12:07:15
<transcript>: okay so

12:07:16
<transcript>: Okay. So.

12:07:19
<transcript>: Up here user.

12:07:24
<transcript>: User and then is paid.

12:07:26
<transcript>: User.

12:07:29
<transcript>: So then.

12:07:29
<transcript>: i'm

12:07:32
<transcript>: I'm doing a case statement here.

12:07:36
<transcript>: This just feels weird.

12:07:40
<transcript>: Tastes true.

12:07:40
thdxr: yeah because of serverless

12:07:45
<transcript>: Or no. Is there a way to do like a turnerary.

12:07:52
<transcript>: Dax.

12:08:00
<transcript>: This feels weird to be like case is paid true return true false return that that feels weird.

12:08:00
<transcript>: doesn't

12:08:02
<transcript>: Doesn't it.

12:08:10
<transcript>: Feels weird. I love it. Don't love it.

12:08:13
<transcript>: This just feels like not good. Elixir.

12:08:13
<transcript>: like nothing in the

12:08:14
foobfoob: interesting

12:08:17
<transcript>: Like nothing in the code base. Looks like this.

12:08:28
thdxr: the case should go in the with also right

12:08:36
<transcript>: So technically, at the end of these two, I'm doing the same thing. It's just I'm either passing user or visitor. I feel like there's something way the case should go in the width. Also, right. Oh, you can do that.

12:08:40
<transcript>: How do you do that.

12:08:44
<transcript>: I don't understand how I would do that.

12:08:50
thdxr: match it as true in the with

12:08:50
<transcript>: I don't see a case in a.

12:08:50
<transcript>: width

12:08:52
<transcript>: Width.

12:08:56
<transcript>: Match. It is true in the width.

12:09:05
thdxr: true <- is_paid

12:09:10
<transcript>: True is paid.

12:09:22
<transcript>: Oh true.

12:09:29
<transcript>: You're saying, dude, what true? And I am not an elixir Dev like that.

12:09:44
<transcript>: There's a case here. Where.

12:09:50
<transcript>: Oh, man, I feel like this is so terribly implemented.

12:09:50
<transcript>: aside from

12:09:56
<transcript>: Aside from just the issue of this weird case statement, now I'm starting to think.

12:09:56
<transcript>: it's like

12:09:57
thdxr: hang on trying to understand what you're doing

12:09:58
terawatthour: LGTM 👍 squash and merge

12:09:58
<transcript>: It's like get the user.

12:09:58
<transcript>: if

12:10:16
<transcript>: If there is no user, get the visitor pass either one of them the user or the visitor to get ask count if it's not a paid user. Does that make sense? Yeah. So let me walk through it. Look at me squash and merge. So we get a user from the connection.

12:10:20
<transcript>: If there is a user.

12:10:20
<transcript>: and

12:10:22
<transcript>: And it's a paid user.

12:10:25
<transcript>: This can query should return true.

12:10:29
kryotoboi: I have never used the bff pattern. Does it introduce more latency in the system ?

12:10:30
<transcript>: And is paid is just this function that's going to look at something on the user or whatever.

12:10:31
thdxr: also getting drenched rn

12:10:38
<transcript>: If there's not a user, we check the visitor and we pass it to the same function. Get as count. You see what I'm saying.

12:10:38
<transcript>: getting drenched

12:10:40
<transcript>: Getting drenched right now, or are you working out.

12:10:43
<transcript>: You don't have to do this right now if you're busy.

12:10:43
<transcript>: i've never

12:10:47
terawatthour: i challenge u to migrate this thing to kotlin

12:10:47
<transcript>: I've never used the bff pattern. Does it introduce more latency in the system.

12:10:50
<transcript>: The back end for the front end.

12:10:55
<transcript>: I challenge you to migrate this thing to kotlin.

12:10:55
<transcript>: i feel like

12:11:00
thdxr: no I'm outside lol

12:11:01
<transcript>: I feel like this logic is so not done right? I'm not doing this right.

12:11:05
<transcript>: Why.

12:11:05
<transcript>: what

12:11:06
thdxr: rainy af

12:11:06
<transcript>: What is this.

12:11:06
<transcript>: elf what is

12:11:08
<transcript>: Elf? What is that.

12:11:11
<transcript>: Oh, you're you're outside.

12:11:11
<transcript>: training

12:11:12
<transcript>: Training.

12:11:25
<transcript>: Like I just want to feel like I wrote some. I wrote some good elixir, you know. Oh, maybe I'll ask Chad gbt.

12:11:31
<transcript>: Chat, gbt to ride it in a more elixir way.

12:11:36
<transcript>: And I'm gonna change this to be it's gonna be.

12:11:41
<transcript>: User.

12:11:50
<transcript>: Let's go. Fake it. Yeah. So Subscription status? Yeah, sure.

12:11:54
<transcript>: Fake that so that Chad gbt can do something intelligent. Okay.

12:11:57
<transcript>: We're gonna do this.

12:12:08
<transcript>: Yank it and let's ask. Chat. Gbt. Dax is busy. Chat gbt is the next best thing, nizley. Thank you so much for that. Follow. I appreciate your follow, nizzley.

12:12:08
<transcript>: chat

12:12:11
<transcript>: Chat OpenAI.

12:12:13
<transcript>: For Version four.

12:12:16
<transcript>: I'm struggling.

12:12:16
<transcript>: to

12:12:17
<transcript>: To simplify.

12:12:20
<transcript>: Some logic.

12:12:20
<transcript>: in

12:12:22
<transcript>: In elixir.

12:12:24
<transcript>: Can you please.

12:12:24
<transcript>: rewrite

12:12:26
<transcript>: Rewrite this code.

12:12:29
<transcript>: To be.

12:12:29
<transcript>: more idio

12:12:31
<transcript>: More idiomatic.

12:12:31
<transcript>: el

12:12:33
<transcript>: Elixir.

12:12:37
<transcript>: Idiomatic. Video.

12:12:41
<transcript>: Should I tell it I saw somebody say this on Twitter.

12:12:46
<transcript>: You are a world class.

12:12:46
<transcript>: elix

12:12:46
thdxr: idiotic

12:12:47
terawatthour: why are you talking to a computer sir?

12:12:49
<transcript>: Elixir, engineer.

12:12:55
<transcript>: I am new to elixir and need you to.

12:12:58
<transcript>: Help me.

12:12:58
<transcript>: write

12:13:00
<transcript>: Write better.

12:13:00
<transcript>: code

12:13:02
<transcript>: Code? I don't know.

12:13:07
<transcript>: Somebody said You're supposed to tell it. It's like a world class. Something. I don't know.

12:13:07
<transcript>: why are you talking

12:13:10
<transcript>: Why are you talking to a computer, Sir.

12:13:15
<transcript>: Let's do the tick Mark.

12:13:18
sibookait: @TeraWattHour LUL

12:13:21
<transcript>: To denote that we are in the code block. Here we go.

12:13:28
<transcript>: Let's see what it does.

12:13:34
sibookait: Are there message limit?

12:13:37
<transcript>: Rewritten your code to be more idiomatic elixir OOH I'm so excited. Is it going to do a good job.

12:13:39
<transcript>: K.

12:13:39
<transcript>: kase

12:13:44
<transcript>: Kaser gitcurrent user if is paid user is this what I had before.

12:13:48
<transcript>: I think this might be what I had before.

12:13:53
<transcript>: Is that the simplest.

12:13:56
thdxr: that looks bad lol

12:13:57
terawatthour: that @doc comment reminds me of jsdoc and i dont like it

12:13:57
<transcript>: Was I trying to get too fancy.

12:13:57
<transcript>: are there message

12:14:03
<transcript>: Are there message limit? Yeah. I think it's like 25. That looks bad. Yeah, that doesn't feel like idiomatic.

12:14:17
<transcript>: That looks bad. That does not look like all the pretty elixir in this code base.

12:14:17
<transcript>: you replace

12:14:22
<transcript>: You replace a with statement with a K statement to match result.

12:14:22
<transcript>: more conc

12:14:24
<transcript>: More concise and easy to follow.

12:14:32
<transcript>: Let's say this.

12:14:33
kampouse: you got trick it gave you the same code

12:14:37
<transcript>: I don't love the if else statement.

12:14:40
<transcript>: You got tricket gave you the same code.

12:14:43
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat campus.

12:14:46
<transcript>: Let's say this.

12:14:48
<transcript>: Let's say.

12:14:50
<transcript>: This is better.

12:14:50
<transcript>: but

12:14:52
<transcript>: But.

12:14:55
<transcript>: I don't love the.

12:14:55

12:14:56
raondev: do you have the plugin prev for chatgpt ?

12:14:57

<transcript>: Can it be simplified further.

12:15:03
<transcript>: Still.

12:15:09
<transcript>: Have the plugin preview for Chad gbd no.

12:15:09
<transcript>: do

12:15:16
<transcript>: Do I have access to the plugins? The beta? No, I do not. But I want that. I want it.

12:15:16
<transcript>: of course

12:15:18
kampouse: is there a match close ? in elixir?

12:15:22
<transcript>: Of course, you can use a short circuit evaluation with the or operator. Simplify the fl statement. Here's an updated version of your code.

12:15:31
<transcript>: Is there a match close in. Elixir. I don't know. I don't know what a match closes. I guess.

12:15:36
<transcript>: Is paid user or okay, so that's a little better. That's a little better.

12:15:40
<transcript>: Okay, we're getting somewhere. This is fun.

12:15:45
<transcript>: It's a little better, right. But now I'm going to ask it.

12:15:50
sibookait: yeah Elixir has pattern matching

12:15:57
<transcript>: If I feel like the fact that git ask count can take in a user or visitor like I did all the work of having two different versions of that that handle the different cases.

12:15:57
<transcript>: well can i

12:16:04
<transcript>: Well, can I not just simplify and only have to call it once? I don't know. Maybe I'm getting way too. Like maybe that's not even better.

12:16:04
<transcript>: is that even

12:16:05
<transcript>: Is that even better.

12:16:14
<transcript>: Someone tell me should I worry about the fact that I'm calling this twice with visitor or user? Is there a better version.

12:16:14
<transcript>: maybe not

12:16:16
<transcript>: Maybe not. Maybe this is the best.

12:16:16
<transcript>: get

12:16:18
<transcript>: Get current user we do this.

12:16:18
<transcript>: we return

12:16:23
<transcript>: We return is paid user or wait. This is valid in elixir right.

12:16:28
<transcript>: Sometimes I worry about chat gbt not knowing what it's doing.

12:16:30
kampouse: case 10 do ...>   ^x -> "Won't match" ...>   _ -> "Will match" ...> end

12:16:34
<transcript>: I'm liking this.

12:16:41
<transcript>: One last question.

12:16:43
<transcript>: Can I.

12:16:46
<transcript>: Holiday.

12:16:48
<transcript>: The.

12:16:48
<transcript>: ask

12:16:49
<transcript>: Ask.

12:16:49
<transcript>: git

12:16:51
<transcript>: Git ask.

12:16:53
<transcript>: Count.

12:16:57
<transcript>: Halls.

12:17:01
<transcript>: Since it can take.

12:17:01
<transcript>: in

12:17:02
<transcript>: In.

12:17:02
<transcript>: a

12:17:05
<transcript>: A user or a visitor.

12:17:14
<transcript>: Just going to ask Chad gbt. I don't need to ask you guys anymore. You've been replaced. Sorry. Twitch chat.

12:17:17
<transcript>: You can consolidate.

12:17:18
kampouse: :(

12:17:25
<transcript>: Moving it outside the case statement and buying the result to a variable. I don't know if this is going to be better, but we're going to see. I'm just kidding. I could never replace you people.

12:17:25
<transcript>: you people

12:17:28
<transcript>: You people mean the world to me.

12:17:28
<transcript>: entity

12:17:28
iannery: morning adam!

12:17:30
<transcript>: Entity case.

12:17:30
<transcript>: i don't know

12:17:32
<transcript>: I don't know if I like this.

12:17:38
<transcript>: Do we like this.

12:17:39
sibookait: try cond statements

12:17:47
<transcript>: Is that better? Someone tell me if that's better. Try conditional statements. Good morning, Lannery.

12:17:48
terawatthour: if so give us all macbooks

12:17:52
<transcript>: Is this better.

12:17:58
<transcript>: If so, give us all macbooks. Somebody tell me if this is better. Do you like this? Better.

12:18:00
<transcript>: Set entity.

12:18:00
<transcript>: to

12:18:09
<transcript>: To that basically get the user or the visitor. I could make a function that gets useDr or visitor. Hey, that's a good idea. I like that.

12:18:14
<transcript>: I kind of like that.

12:18:21
<transcript>: I'm getting hung up in the weeds here, aren't I.

12:18:21
longhumans: g'day all.

12:18:23
kampouse: more function better right

12:18:28
<transcript>: Good morning? Long day or long humans? Good day.

12:18:30
<transcript>: More function? Better. Right.

12:18:33
<transcript>: Wait. What more.

12:18:33
<transcript>: function

12:18:36
<transcript>: Functions better? Yeah. Probably.

12:18:38
terawatthour: this code feels like it shouldnt even touch version control let alone production

12:18:40
<transcript>: Oh.

12:18:40
<transcript>: let's move

12:18:40
sibookait: yeah function it is functional language LUL

12:18:41
<transcript>: Let's move.

12:18:48
<transcript>: This code feels like it shouldn't even touch version grow, let alone.

12:18:54
<transcript>: Oh, no, dara. Watt. Let's do this. Let's move.

12:18:54
<transcript>: the

12:18:56
<transcript>: The code that.

12:18:58
<transcript>: Gets.

12:18:58
<transcript>: the

12:19:00
<transcript>: The user.

12:19:00
dnbull: Good morning @adamdotdev KonCha

12:19:03
<transcript>: Or visitor to.

12:19:03
<transcript>: a separate

12:19:05
<transcript>: A separate function.

12:19:10
<transcript>: I can move that to a different file if it makes more sense somewhere else.

12:19:10
<transcript>: get

12:19:13
<transcript>: Get entity to handle getting yeah, let's do that.

12:19:13
<transcript>: so let me see

12:19:16
<transcript>: So let me see if this already exists actually.

12:19:20
<transcript>: Get current user.

12:19:20
<transcript>: i kind of

12:19:23
<transcript>: I kind of look around here where this might exist.

12:19:26
<transcript>: Infinity controller.

12:19:30
<transcript>: User.

12:19:31
terawatthour: frustration kicking in: adam stopped capitalizing sentences

12:19:36
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the follow. Marcos.

12:19:44
<transcript>: Frustration kicking in. Adam. Stopped capitalizing sentences. It's true. Dm. Bulls here. Good morning, Dean. Bull.

12:19:46
<transcript>: Good morning.

12:19:46
<transcript>: let's see

12:19:49
<transcript>: Let's see so git current user.

thdxr: time to run to the gym in the rain

12:19:59
thdxr: #nodaysoff

12:19:59
<transcript>: Root view let's see.

12:20:04
<transcript>: What would it be in.

12:20:04
<transcript>: there is

12:20:06
<transcript>: There is something.

12:20:11
<transcript>: User.

12:20:19
terawatthour: what does the % operand do?

12:20:22
<transcript>: Select this code.

12:20:30
<transcript>: Get User ID. Get Visitor ID.

12:20:32
kampouse: @thdxr imagine taking a rest

12:20:42
<transcript>: Like somewhere we've got to be doing this logic where it's like, fall back to a visitor if there's no.

12:20:48
earholesmcgee: Ive never seen Elixier in the wild. Whats your thoughts? Why did you choose it for stat muse?

12:21:03
terawatthour: @thdxr sir this is mcdonalds. what can i get you?

12:21:04
<transcript>: Get user ID.

12:21:12
<transcript>: Put if so, there we're putting if User ID or Visitor ID.

12:21:21
<transcript>: What does the percent time to run to the gym.

12:21:23
nft_scam: @thdxr 💪 chad

12:21:27
<transcript>: In the rain. No days off. What does the percent operand do? I have no idea.

12:21:38
<transcript>: I have no idea. I've never seen elixir in the wild. What are your thoughts? Why'd you choose it for sammy's? I didn't choose it. We chose it because we had an engineer that was really into it and wanted to ride it in elixir. And we were like, Sounds good.

12:21:38
<transcript>: that's why

12:21:48
<transcript>: That's why we chose it. And it's fine. It doesn't have types. So that's a thing. But it's kind of fun to play with functional languages. I don't know. I don't do it a lot.

12:21:58
<transcript>: Let's do get visitor current visitor and see if we can find any I feel like this should already be a thing.

12:22:01
<transcript>: Print visitor.

12:22:10
<transcript>: It's not going to be in a controller. It's going to be like a service.

12:22:14
<transcript>: What's this.

12:22:21
<transcript>: Okay. Maybe it doesn't exist. Maybe this is not a thing that exists.

12:22:22
sibookait: @TeraWattHour it is used for creating struct

12:22:32
<transcript>: Asker we do map merge user and visitor. I guess it's a pretty cheap operation to get the user.

12:22:32
<transcript>: i think it's not

12:22:35
<transcript>: I think it's not like a database query, right.

12:22:44
<transcript>: Wait, what from connection? Yeah, it's like already on the connection. Wait, How's that work, though.

12:22:44
<transcript>: i don't actually

12:22:46
<transcript>: I don't actually know.

12:22:49
<transcript>: Okay. Let's go.

12:22:49
<transcript>: see

12:22:51
<transcript>: See what they did here with this code.

12:22:57
<transcript>: Is page user default? Oh, they did fancy things.

12:23:02
<transcript>: Oh, look at this. That's cool. They made it way better.

12:23:02
<transcript>: so

12:23:05
<transcript>: So get entity.

12:23:10
<transcript>: Yeah get either the current user or the current visitor. So entity is get entity.

12:23:12
<transcript>: Now I'm just wondering.

12:23:12
<transcript>: why even

12:23:20
<transcript>: Why even do it here? Should the code just live in the get ass account and I just pass a connection to it. Oh man.

12:23:29
<transcript>: I'm code golfing. Why am I doing this? Why do I care? Let's just copy all this code.

12:23:29
<transcript>: i don't

12:23:33
<transcript>: I don't need to mess with it doesn't matter.

12:23:38
<transcript>: Doesn't matter right now I'm trying to get too cute.

12:23:38
<transcript>: too

12:23:39
<transcript>: Too cute.

12:23:44
<transcript>: Okay. So we're just going to paste it all in here.

12:23:46
<transcript>: Cam query.

12:23:46
<transcript>: is now

12:23:47
earholesmcgee: Do you have any tips for learning VIM?

12:23:48
<transcript>: Is now git entity.

12:23:53
<transcript>: This is private.

12:23:58
<transcript>: Saying I don't need to put a dock on it.

12:23:58
<transcript>: okay

12:23:59
<transcript>: Okay.

12:24:06
<transcript>: Should I delete it? I should delete this private thing.

12:24:06
<transcript>: feels like

12:24:13

12:24:15
<transcript>: Move it down here.

12:24:21
matty_twoshoes: do multi-redeems make any difference?

12:24:22
<transcript>: Is paid user.

12:24:29
<transcript>: Can query. We get the entity if it's a paid user.

12:24:34
<transcript>: It can query, or if the ask count is less than.

12:24:34
<transcript>: i mean it's

12:24:37
<transcript>: I mean, it's ten right now, but we'll change that obviously.

12:24:37
<transcript>: is this

12:24:39
<transcript>: Is this a paid user.

12:24:43
<transcript>: Off get user is paid.

12:24:43
<transcript>: user

12:24:45
<transcript>: User, false.

12:24:50
<transcript>: I could just hand it the connection. Wait. What.

12:24:55
<transcript>: And then Key subscription says, oh, yeah, user doesn't have that now.

12:24:57
<transcript>: Going to have to add it.

12:25:01
<transcript>: Add it to this schema.

12:25:12
<transcript>: Field. So I guess we're just going to add it down here. Virtual fields.

12:25:16
<transcript>: How am I going to change the scheme of the database.

12:25:16
<transcript>: i have no

12:25:18
<transcript>: I have no idea.

12:25:24
<transcript>: Where is the database.

12:25:24
<transcript>: did i see

12:25:31
<transcript>: Did I see it somewhere in here support migrations structure. So I'm going to have to.

12:25:32
<transcript>: Add it to.

12:25:36
<transcript>: Okay. So I'm going to add a migration somehow.

12:25:46
<transcript>: Migrations.

12:25:49
<transcript>: Okay.

12:25:54
<transcript>: Do I have to manually add the migration? Is there like a cli tool? Okay, this is we're Googling.

12:25:56
<transcript>: Elixir.

12:25:56
<transcript>: ect

12:25:57
kampouse: yes

12:25:59
<transcript>: Ecto Migration or something.

12:26:05
<transcript>: Delete your current code editor that is not vim.

12:26:05
<transcript>: oh

12:26:09
kampouse: dont do it by hand

12:26:16
<transcript>: Oh, do you have any tip? What was it? Do you have any tips for learning them? That's a great one. Just don't use the other thing. Also, stream twitch Chat is extremely helpful.

12:26:16
<transcript>: are you

12:26:28
<transcript>: Are you winning, son? I don't know. Actually. Maddie, welcome, maddie. I don't know if I'm winning or not. We're making stuff. We're doing stuff. I feel like there's got to be, like a mix. Yeah. Ectogen migration. Here we go.

12:26:30
<transcript>: Generates a migration.

12:26:30
<transcript>: rep

12:26:36
<transcript>: Repository must be set under Ecto's repos in the current App configuration or given via the R option.

12:26:43
<transcript>: Okay. Let's see if Ectogen migration is anywhere in here. Ectogen.

12:26:47
<transcript>: Okay.

12:26:51
<transcript>: Ectogen migration.

12:26:51
<transcript>: what

12:26:53
<transcript>: What is this.

12:26:56
cra5h16: what is the go to place to learn AWS?

12:27:02

12:27:04
<transcript>: Migrate.

12:27:04
<transcript>: roll

12:27:09
<transcript>: Rollback timestamp? What are all these.

12:27:14
<transcript>: So you're saying I should just call timestamp instead of.

12:27:21
<transcript>: Oh, boy. So, is he just running these things with iex.

12:27:24
<transcript>: Like running these things.

12:27:26
<transcript>: Oh boy.

12:27:33
<transcript>: So I'm at the author. I need to create a new migration.

12:27:37
<transcript>: I wonder if there's like a bin.

12:27:40
<transcript>: Let's see.

12:27:45
<transcript>: What's this do.

12:27:48
<transcript>: Release task setup DB.

12:27:48
<transcript>: that's released

12:27:49
sibookait: you should use some command

12:27:51
<transcript>: That's released now we don't want that.

12:27:54
<transcript>: Temp. Okay, let's see. Is there.

12:27:54
<transcript>: a bin

12:27:56
<transcript>: A bin.

12:28:01
<transcript>: Readme. Says nothing. I don't think about migration.

12:28:01
<transcript>: migrations

12:28:02
<transcript>: Migrations.

12:28:02
<transcript>: or cli

12:28:06
<transcript>: Or cli tools. Oh, that might do it. Okay, let's do this.

12:28:08
sibookait: mix ecto.gen.migration add_weather_table

12:28:09
<transcript>: Let's do this Mothra.

12:29:05
<transcript>: it's

12:29:09
<transcript>: It's a mode. Signal switches. I should put that in the command.

12:29:12
<transcript>: Migration should be auto.

12:29:26
<transcript>: Generated by ecto. Yeah, I'm sure that that's the case. I just don't know if we have our own tooling that does extra stuff. It looks like we do. Let's look what's in bin here. Moffred dev release.

<transcript>: So I would ask Chad gbt, but I'm actually looking for specifically.

12:32:05
<transcript>: If we have like a process.

12:32:05
<transcript>: in our code

12:32:10
<transcript>: In our code base that layers stuff on top of the typical process.

12:32:10
<transcript>: so

12:32:12
<transcript>: So we have a bunch of.

12:32:12
<transcript>: custom

12:32:16
<transcript>: Custom cli tools and stuff, and I was just trying to gather.

12:32:16
<transcript>: what is the

12:32:30
<transcript>: What is the process? Do we have one for creating? Is it a non standard process? Because like this stuff generate a new version time stamp of same logic Asogen ecto Gen migration. Like what are these used for.

12:32:35
<transcript>: And like migrate that just runs.

12:32:46
<transcript>: Migrator. Okay. So I guess I'm just going to do the standard thing for creating migration. We'll just see what it does. I guess what's the harm? It's just going to generate a file. So what is it's.

12:32:46
<transcript>: mix ectog

12:32:52
<transcript>: Mix ectogen migration, and I name the migration. Oh, and then I need to provide.

12:33:03
<transcript>: The R option. I guess it'll just use the current app, so that should be fine. So the migration name. Okay. We're doing this. We're doing this.

12:33:05
<transcript>: Like this.

12:33:08
<transcript>: We're going to call this migration.

12:33:08

12:37:14
<transcript>: i'll take it

12:37:19
<transcript>: I'll take it. I'll take three. You can keep pasting them. They'll keep popping up in my browser as long as they're safe.

12:37:30
<transcript>: Let's see. Are we heading in that direction? Well, if anybody were to carry the blame for losing the claim, then it can't be poor old Ferris.

12:37:59
<transcript>: Okay, gurgley. He's the guy. I'm sure I said his name wrong. Gurgly. It's probably not Gurgley, is it? He's the one that has all the inside contacts at every place. And he tweets about everything that's breaking.

nft_scam: https://twitter.com/nixcraft/status/1645840650620014592/photo/1

12:38:19
<transcript>: I think about this startup I talked with which had a pitch deck but not a website. I told them I like what they do and would mention them in my article. If I can link a website or if I can link a website, the founder told me they are heads down building it. Their eta is three weeks for a basic site. Ooh the same founder told me their launch plan is to rent billboards.

12:38:39
<transcript>: Rent billboards around San Francisco together with a PR run on websites doing what twilio did what? And they didn't have a website to collect leads. I really don't think they're the startup. They think they are not the hungry type. To add context, what was odd was not that a startup would take weeks to build a website. I mean, it takes time.

12:38:39
<transcript>: what was

12:38:39
vimcerf: https://twitter.com/dog_rates/status/1645822026861649920

12:38:43
<transcript>: What was odd is the founder reached out to me in what seemed like.

12:38:45
vimcerf: I'm only following one account on twitter, so...

12:38:47
<transcript>: Wanting to get coverage.

12:38:47
<transcript>: mentioned

12:38:51
<transcript>: Mentioned they spent this time at no website. I see.

12:39:10
<transcript>: Oh spicy replies. So basically you only like startups that engage in hustle culture. Please don't put things in my mouth. I did not say I was surprised the startup would not prioritize capturing any leads while simultaneously the founder reaching out to share their pitch deck in hopes of getting coverage either way.

12:39:10
<transcript>: is

12:39:22
<transcript>: Is the founder? Either why is the founder spending time on reaching out to get the word out? Or if it's important, why not have at least a basic website describe what they will do and capture leads.

12:39:26
<transcript>: Oh, not the hungry type.

12:39:26
<transcript>: that's the hust

12:39:28
thdxr: why is he replying to that moron

12:39:39
kampouse: common just make a wix

12:39:41
<transcript>: That's the hustle culture language he's speaking of. What do you think? What's twitch Chat say? Do you think this is hustle culture language or no, I don't get the read that Gurgley good old Gurgley is a hustle culture type. That's not what I've gathered from him so far.

12:39:41
<transcript>: why is

12:39:47
<transcript>: Why is he replying to that moron? You're only following one account on Twitter. Vim surf? Are you kidding me.

12:39:51

nft_scam: https://twitter.com/vim_tricks/status/1642962568586076171

12:40:03
<transcript>: I don't know. What do we think? It's three weeks, a long time to make a basic side. If you're a startup, maybe because for three weeks, you're building your product and then you finally build your website at the very end of that three weeks, I don't know. Three weeks.

12:40:03
<transcript>: no you know what

12:40:04
schrew: Marketing is quite literally the hustle department. Working publicly is their whole thing

12:40:08
<transcript>: No, you know what? Okay, so me and dax just did the rebase TV landing page.

12:40:08
<transcript>: it took us

12:40:11
<transcript>: It took us what, a whole week.

12:40:11
<transcript>: took us

12:40:13
<transcript>: Took us a week.

12:40:18
<transcript>: And there's two of us. I like to think we're pretty good at what we do.

12:40:18
<transcript>: i mean

12:40:23
<transcript>: I mean, that took us a week because we also built some other stuff, like when you sign up.

12:40:23
<transcript>: when you sign

12:40:25
<transcript>: When you sign up.

12:40:28
<transcript>: You get like a card.

12:40:29
thdxr: it depends what the product is, withbumi.com took 1 day

12:40:32
<transcript>: Like you get one of these that's generated and it generates.

12:40:32
<transcript>: and the referral stuff

12:40:34
thdxr: because it was super simple

12:40:38
<transcript>: And the referral stuff. We had do the referral stuff. We had a lot to do, okay. It was a lot of work. Okay.

12:40:40
elicxlive: It all depends on if you have a design ready and how complex it will be. 3 weeks could be realistic

12:40:40
<transcript>: Don't judge us.

12:40:40
<transcript>: depends

12:40:46
<transcript>: Depends what the product is with boomi took one day because it was super simple. Yeah, you could definitely.

12:40:51
<transcript>: Stand up a landing page in a day. It's just, what are they trying to do on their landing page? I guess.

12:40:57
<transcript>: So yeah, Gurgley is surprised that.

12:41:07
nexxeln: https://twitter.com/trashh_dev/status/1645910466097725440

12:41:10
<transcript>: Somebody tell me how to pronounce his name. I feel like I'm saying yarguay now gurgley, his issue is that they're reaching out, trying to get publicity, but they don't have a website to capture leads yet.

12:41:10
<transcript>: okay

12:41:11
<transcript>: Okay. That's kind of like.

12:41:16
<transcript>: What I would say about this whole Tweet and this whole interaction.

12:41:16
<transcript>: is

12:41:19
<transcript>: Is I don't know it's all mid.

12:41:19
<transcript>: i don

12:41:21
<transcript>: I don't really care.

12:41:21
<transcript>: no shame on

12:41:35
<transcript>: No shame on whoever tweeted this or whoever provided this Tweet for our viewing pleasure. Just like the whole thing is kind of underwhelming. I'm okay. I'm going to move on. Wrote a simple script to convert prisma schema to drizzle. Or M. Schema. Oh, interesting. Does it work.

12:41:38
<transcript>: So there's a Prisma.

12:41:38
<transcript>: schema

12:41:42
thdxr: drizzle taking over

12:41:42
<transcript>: Schema moved into drizzle. Syntax.

12:41:47
nft_scam: oooooooo

12:41:51
<transcript>: The drizzle team going to have this nice button where you can just convert your prisma app to drizzle. How much would that be? Awesome.

12:41:51
<transcript>: that would

12:41:54
<transcript>: That would be nice drizzle. Taking over.

12:42:03
thdxr: amazing how much energy there around it in just a month

12:42:12
<transcript>: Is this person work at drizzle full size developer any higher? No. Yeah. If the drizzle team could just make a little button, you click and it submits a PR to your repo to convert to drizzle. How nice would that be? Ai can crack most common passwords in less than a minute. Oh, boy.

12:42:20
<transcript>: Did everyone use multifactor? I use multifactor for everything. So I'm less concerned about this kind of thing, but.

12:42:32
kampouse: use physical key

12:42:36
<transcript>: It's almost like that. If I want to read hustle Culture, I just go on LinkedIn.

12:42:36

thdxr: lol

12:42:39
<transcript>: Yeah, LinkedIn is such a joke.

12:42:39

12:44:06
<transcript>: okay so next

12:44:13

12:44:13
<transcript>: oh too many

12:44:22
<transcript>: Oh too many images. What was this in reply to these settle wins are what make Next impossible to beat next image. The new font, stuff, metadata, et cetera is really hard to leave behind all the wins.

12:44:26
lesabotsy: @kampouse does it count though?

12:44:29
thdxr: SIMP

12:44:42
<transcript>: What is the tweet from delba file based Metadata api? Drop an icon or og image into App and Nixjs will auto generate robot friendly metadata for you an icon or og image. Oh, okay, I got to look at that diagram, generate image, robots, sitemap and manifest files using typeset apis. So I actually love this.

<transcript>: Non api routes like I wanted to generate non page files dynamically so like for public.

12:44:53
<transcript>: to generate

12:44:55
<transcript>: To generate a sitemap.

12:44:55
<transcript>: is like

12:45:00
lesabotsy: @adamdotdev nope, discord is one I guess 👍

12:45:03
kampouse: @Lesabotsy if it count would you delete your twitch?

12:45:11
<transcript>: Is like just a file that I could run some code, and it would generate the sitemap, you know what I mean? And it sounds like that's what this is. It sounds like. So App icons do this static file api. Drop a file into App. Okay. So I drop a ICO file into app.

12:45:15
<transcript>: Or this dynamic route API.

12:45:15
<transcript>: what

12:45:16
<transcript>: What.

12:45:16
<transcript>: so to have a dynamic

12:45:18

12:46:02
<transcript>: yeah

12:46:04
<transcript>: Yeah.

12:46:04
<transcript>: but next js

12:46:09

<transcript>: Discord. Maybe that's it. Lesa. That's what I saw.

12:46:30

12:46:30
<transcript>: haven

12:46:38
<transcript>: Haven't really seen any other good tweets since tech Twitter is consumed with AI. It has been a lot of AI talk. I will give you that.

12:46:41
<transcript>: if it count

schrew: LUL

12:47:01
<transcript>: If it count, would you delete your twitch? So you guys are talking. Have you seen slash talked about the proposal for the new rust trademark policy by the Rest Foundation bracket. Matt, I've seen it. I've been on the Internet, so it's hard not to see it. I don't have opinions. I don't write rust. I mean, I have opinions that. That sucks. I hope they walk it back because the outrage seems pretty intense.

12:47:07
privann: helllo Adam :D

12:47:12
<transcript>: We'll see. How will I be able to troll Adam without an account? Yeah, exactly. Leslie, you can't delete your twitch account. They stole my idea. Listen, I came up with next savicon. Okay.

12:47:12
<transcript>: i should

12:47:20
<transcript>: I should have registered that trademark. How funny would it have been if I actually paid a lawyer to register the trademark? Next slash Fabicon.

12:47:26
<transcript>: Can you even register? I don't know if that could be a trademark, but how funny would that have been.

12:47:26

extremelyryan: how much push back did you get for your pineapple on pizza tweet?

12:47:49
<transcript>: Okay, so I should stop trying to read every word of this. The general sentiment totally agree with theo. It's very hard for me to build outside of nextjs. Now, when I'm used to having all those nice things I loved Next font. When it came out, I was so hyped to just import a font, use it and no layout shift. Everything's. Great.

12:47:51

12:47:51

privann: Just had a chat with my boss on salary increase and team change :D

12:47:56
privann: how bout u

12:48:03
<transcript>: But there's so many things about using Astro that I love now, especially, it's such a perfect marriage of use case and technology. Astro fits the SAP music use case so well.

12:48:17
<transcript>: That now instead of feeling like, oh, I wish I were in next. Js. I just think, like, I need to build whatever I'm missing in astro. I need to build it, and it just needs to exist. The astro ecosystem, I think, is poised to have all these same things.

12:48:17
<transcript>: as

12:48:34
<transcript>: As plugins or whatever astro is so extensible it so plugs into everything. Extensible is maybe not the word I'm even looking for. It so fits into the modern ecosystem of like I want to be able to plug in any front end or I want to plug in to any hosting provider.

12:48:34
<transcript>: it has

12:48:36
<transcript>: It has that ability.

12:48:36
<transcript>: and it just

12:48:42
schrew: https://twitter.com/vprdev/status/1598674984184213507

12:48:53
<transcript>: And it just feels very adaptable. So I feel like it's a perfect framework to build on top of. If you're an author, a library author, build third party solutions for all this stuff because I do love all that stuff in xjs, and I wish I had it okay. Now back to the original Tweet. Sorry, that was layers, layers, people.

12:48:53
<transcript>: next slash

12:48:58
<transcript>: Next slash image is just a way to get a huge bill on yourself. You have too many.

12:49:04
<transcript>: Seal says the bill is bigger if you don't optimize your images and host them yourself, okay.

12:49:05
cra5h16: The more time I spend with those meta frameworks the more I tend to go back to basics.   Something like Astro and Vite imo offer the bare minimum need.

12:49:06
<transcript>: I got to think through this.

12:49:06
<transcript>: i really have to

12:49:10
<transcript>: I really have to process things linearly. So next, says.

12:49:10
<transcript>: next

12:49:18
<transcript>: Next image is just a way to get a huge bill on for sale if you have too many images, Theo says the bill is bigger if you don't use Next image next is I'm not sure about that.

12:49:18
<transcript>: and theo

12:49:20
cra5h16: which is great

12:49:30
extremelyryan: as someone who is not in the web-dev space, how do you keep up on all these different frameworks?  I have a hard enough time dealing with different versions of c++

12:49:32
<transcript>: And theo says $5 per 1000 source images, $40 per 100 gigabyte of traffic, $5 for 12.5 gigabyte. If 1000 optimized Images can save you 12.5gb of bandwidth, it's worth it. So the problem with this.

12:49:32
<transcript>: i just

12:49:34
kampouse: could you say astro is a framework-platfrom ?

12:49:35
<transcript>: I just spit again. The problem with this.

12:49:35
<transcript>: and

12:49:39
<transcript>: And again love Theo. Not criticizing Theo.

12:49:45
nexxeln: the problem is optimizing images is free

12:49:48
nexxeln: with a script

12:49:51
<transcript>: What was that? Was that, siri? On my watch? Oh, wow. Series enlisting all time. My problem with theo suite here is that it assumes you're deploying oversell.

privann: Siri don't understand

12:50:02
<transcript>: Like $40 per 100 gigabyte of traffic is true on versailles. It's not true other places like aws or cloudflare. So Yes.

12:50:02
<transcript>: in his

12:50:02
glamshatterskull: optimizing images is like not hard?

12:50:02
m3talstorm: its 10c/GB in any decent CDN

12:50:05
cra5h16: what is wrong with image cdns? you can even specify sizes and cache stuff

12:50:09
<transcript>: In his example, it's cheaper to use next image than not. But also you could not use versailles. It would be a lot cheaper.

12:50:09
<transcript>: okay

12:50:11
<transcript>: Okay anyway.

12:50:12
darrenbaldwin03: Its 10x cheaper on AWS

12:50:16
darrenbaldwin03: ^^

12:50:21
<transcript>: The problem is optimumizing. Images is free with a script. It is true. You don't need to use versailles for that. It's true. It's convenient. I get it next image. Very convenient.

12:50:21
<transcript>: but

12:50:28
<transcript>: But it's always trade offs like you pay for the convenience. And on Versailles.

12:50:28
<transcript>: you pay

12:50:38
<transcript>: You pay a lot for some of this convenience. That's okay. Or if you're within the free tier, who cares? But if you're building a startup and your project is going to grow and be it.

12:50:45
<transcript>: Large volume like stat muse. We would not be financially viable if we were host. Arm versailles. That's what I would say.

12:50:48
<transcript>: Chad gbt is alive.

12:50:52
<transcript>: Optimizing images is like not hard.

12:50:52
<transcript>: it's not

12:50:57
<transcript>: It's not. I mean, most of these things aren't hard, but it is a lot of little wins that if I want to stand some.

12:50:57
<transcript>: fast next

12:50:59
darrenbaldwin03: The entire Vercel product is at its highest level a convenience ontop of AWS

12:51:00
<transcript>: Fast next js on versaille. Super fast.

12:51:00
<transcript>: it's very conven

12:51:15
<transcript>: It's very convenient. I get the appeal. But if you're in something for the long run, then you start making the trade offs and you start saying, Well, I could just write my own cicd pipeline, or I could just use github actions, and it takes me a day and then it's done.

12:51:35
<transcript>: You start realizing all the devx wins of versailles can be replicated, and then you can save a lot in the long run if your thing is going to live for a long time, if you're just building a stupid thing or it's your personal site and you know it's never going to have a ton of traffic or it's your podcast site or whatever. I've built lots of stuff that I hope some of our sell and I'll never move them because I don't need to because it's not projects that.

12:51:35
<transcript>: i expect

12:51:38
<transcript>: I expect to scale.

12:51:46
<transcript>: And so, yeah, I do have a problem. Like theo has a Tweet that's pinned. So I see it every time I click on this profile.

12:51:46
<transcript>: i have a

12:52:00
<transcript>: I have a problem with this statement that you can scale infinitely for cheap like that. You can build with these tools and scale infinitely for treatment. You can't that's the main problem is that you can't scale infinitely for cheap. In fact, they get quite expensive as you scale.

12:52:00
<transcript>: and

12:52:12
<transcript>: And it depends on your definition of scale. I guess so we're talking tens of thousands of users for dollars a month, maybe. Yeah. I guess that's probably true, but that's not infinitely right. There's a difference in infinitely.

12:52:21
<transcript>: Okay. And tens of thousands of users because satis has millions of users and it would not scale well with this stack.

12:52:24
<transcript>: We'd be hurting in terms of our monthly bill.

12:52:25
glamshatterskull: inifnite is a big statement yeah LUL

12:52:32
<transcript>: Because of the volume of usage, there's just a difference. I'm nitpicking here, but the word infinitely should be reserved.

12:52:32
<transcript>: for

12:52:35
nexxeln: imo planetscale and axiom are the only well priced platforms there

12:52:35
<transcript>: For infinite cases.

12:52:35
<transcript>: infinite

12:52:37
m3talstorm: Ye these are tiny numbers

12:52:42
glamshatterskull: agreed

12:52:45
thdxr: the problem is no one on Twitter has actually built a product that gets used

12:52:55
<transcript>: Infinite. Okay, let's see it's ten cents a gigabyte in any decent cdn. What is wrong with Image cdns? You can even specify sizes in cash up. I've used clike Cloudner in the past and it's not the best in terms of like, does it feel the best using it? I guess that's developer experience doesn't feel the best, but it is like a solution.

12:53:01
vimcerf: @thdxr including twitter themselves

12:53:02
thdxr: I haven't either but SST users have lol

12:53:03
<transcript>: I've also built out homegrown stamp use has our own image generation stuff and optimization stuff. We've got our own pipelines.

12:53:03
<transcript>: they're specific to stat

12:53:13
<transcript>: They're specific to statues, like they take specific information about players and what team they played on and everything else. And they generate an image. So it's not like a generalized solution.

12:53:13
<transcript>: it's ten times

12:53:14
glamshatterskull: @thdxr :closes statmuse:

12:53:16
dnbull: i only create apps that scales to 5 people total Kappa

12:53:18
m3talstorm: @thdxr haha so true

12:53:32
<transcript>: It's ten times cheaper on aws entire version product is at its highest level of convenience on top of aws. That's exactly right. I mean, that's what all these products are. But like Planet Scale, I love it. I think it's a great convenience, and I'm willing to pay for that convenience. Probably more so than I am for my front end hosting of roselle.

12:53:42
cra5h16: Is it possible to do a birds eye view or your architecture (or if you have done already got links?? )

12:53:48
privann: I would only use systems as planetscale and so on for hobby projects.

12:53:48
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. I'm going to stop. Infinite is a big statement. Glam is here. I don't know if I saw that Glam was here. Oh, yeah, I did. I saw you were here, didn't I? I love your name. Glam. Like how it's so shiny. What is that again? How does your name get that shiny color.

12:53:48
<transcript>: it's so cool

12:53:57
privann: otherwise I would use the big ones

12:53:57
glamshatterskull: dumb 7tv stuff

12:54:01
<transcript>: It's so cool. Like, how do you have a gradient on your name? Nexo. Nex. In my opinion, plant skill in Axiom are the only well priced platforms there. Yeah, I love plant scale. I think it's a standout. I've not used Axiom.

12:54:01
<transcript>: but

12:54:07
glamshatterskull: i subbed for a month to check it out.

12:54:12
<transcript>: But placekill is fantastic. These are tiny numbers. Agreed. Now, the problem is, no one on Twitter has actually built a product that gets used. I have dax, can I can I just come out and say.

12:54:17
<transcript>: Is that like I didn't even realize it didn't even occur to me that I am no longer a person.

12:54:17
<transcript>: i always felt

12:54:20
thdxr: yeah you have, tweet it

12:54:21
<transcript>: I always felt like a person who I can't talk. I've not done anything.

12:54:21
<transcript>: stamus

12:54:24
<transcript>: Stamus. Does stuff. Okay.

12:54:24
<transcript>: it does

12:54:31
iannery: I get theo's point there. Considering most platforms only get that userbase, most platforms wont get the notoriety statmuse has. The problem is that in the remote chance a platform gets that famous, it gets bottlenecked due to the tools used.

12:54:33
<transcript>: It does stuff. We got a lot of people that use that news, and it only hit me this week that I'm a person who can get on the Internet and throw my weight around because.

12:54:38
moussx_: Getting into fights on twitter always seem like a losing proposition

12:54:42

12:54:45
dnbull: your opinion matters, Adam you have a real product wth real users

12:54:48

<transcript>: I only create apps that scales to five people total that's most of my apps DMV.

12:55:06
<transcript>: Most of them haven't either, but sst users have. Well, dax, yeah. Ssc is like whole different thing.

12:55:10
<transcript>: It's a different profile.

12:55:10
<transcript>: like

12:55:11
kryotoboi: What stack does twitter run on ?

12:55:12
<transcript>: Like the usage of SST.

12:55:21
<transcript>: You multiply all of the usage of ssd that people use it to build these things. It's a platform. Is it a platform? I don't know. Is it framework, whatever.

12:55:24
moussx_: @Kryotoboi Scala mostly

12:55:24
<transcript>: Including Twitter and sales.

12:55:28
thdxr: omg it's a platform!

12:55:32

12:55:52
<transcript>: but

12:55:57
kryotoboi: Oh Scala. There was so much hype around it back in the day

12:56:04
<transcript>: But they're not public, like we haven't put something on the internet, but I'd be happy to share it with you all you people. I'm always happy to share your stuff with you people at a high level, though. There's like three main pieces.

12:56:04
<transcript>: there's game

12:56:12
<transcript>: There's gamera, which is our Natural Language Processing Service. That's what answers sports questions. You ask a question in English. That's what answers it.

12:56:16
<transcript>: And then mothra is like the back end for our front end.

12:56:27
<transcript>: Yeah, mothra. I mean, it's a mono repo. It holds the front end as well, but mothra is like our elixir Phoenix app. That is like our front end api. It interacts with.

12:56:27
<transcript>: camera

12:56:32
<transcript>: Camera to get answers to questions, but it does a lot of other stuff.

12:56:35
<transcript>: And then the front end.

12:56:35
<transcript>: is

12:56:41
<transcript>: Is Cosmos. I don't know why it's called Cosmos, but the actual front end app is Cosmos.

12:56:43
privann: Whats your take on Elixir? @adamdotdev

12:56:47
<transcript>: And then I guess we have a mobile app, tachikoma. That's an iOS app anyway.

12:56:48
privann: and phoenix

12:56:53
<transcript>: I would only use systems as planescale and so on for hobby projects. Otherwise I would use the big ones.

12:56:53
<transcript>: dumb seven tv

12:57:00

12:57:18
nexxeln: https://7tv.app/store

12:57:20
<transcript>: Get deals point there. Considering most platforms only get that user base, most platforms won't get the notoriety sammy's has problem is that in the remote chance the platform gets that famous, it gets bottlenecked due to the tools used. So another good point Lannery here a good point is that you could build a really successful company that doesn't have the kind of scale that like.

12:57:20
<transcript>: i'm talking about

12:57:20
glamshatterskull: https://7tv.app/

12:57:23
<transcript>: I'm talking about we have at Samus, samus.

12:57:23
<transcript>: is specifically

12:57:24
<transcript>: Is specifically D to C.

12:57:24
<transcript>: like it's like

12:57:27
<transcript>: Like it's like a consumer product.

12:57:28
liijit: WHAT 7tv

12:57:39
<transcript>: Most startups that build things today and become very profitable or whatever they're building like B to B stuff. So in that case, like the actual build boomi. That's not like you're never going to have millions of users. I don't think.

12:57:39
<transcript>: i don't

12:57:55
thdxr: Bumi can't be in vercel

12:57:59
<transcript>: I don't know a ton about it, but if it's a B to B product, you're still going to be at pretty small scale. So in that case you do have a point. I think things like versaille Planet Scale. You could probably scale a pretty profitable business because of the nature of your use case, if you're building a direct to consumer thing like we did with Status, that's when it gets a lot more dicey because you're talking much more.

12:57:59
<transcript>: volume

12:58:00
<transcript>: Volume.

12:58:00
<transcript>: and it gets

12:58:02
matzehs: YEAHBUT7TV

12:58:03
<transcript>: And it gets really pricey.

12:58:03
<transcript>: okay

12:58:04
<transcript>: Okay.

12:58:05
thdxr: less about scale and more about vercel being too shallow

12:58:07
nexxeln: what is bumi

12:58:12
kryotoboi: Hahahha

12:58:14
<transcript>: Getting into fights on Twitter. All these seems like a losing proposition. It's true. Your opinion matters. Adam. You have a real product with real users. I'm a real boy.

12:58:14
<transcript>: that's what that made me

12:58:17
thdxr: we don't have traffic scale but we have incredible complexity

12:58:30
thdxr: @nexxeln my wife and I have a company together called Bumi

12:58:31

12:58:41

12:58:43

12:59:00
<transcript>: It's a platform time to raise a Series B.

12:59:04
<transcript>: What crash? Uhoh, did something crash.

12:59:04
<transcript>: cra

12:59:08
<transcript>: Crash, Star. Oh, your name is Crash. That's how behind I am.

12:59:08
<transcript>: scal

12:59:29
<transcript>: Scala. There was so much hyper ended back in the day. What's your take on elixir pravan in Phoenix? It's great. I mean, it's fun. It's fun to write. It's like my only real exposure to working in a production functional programming repo. So in that sense, it's fun. It's kind of fun to think in the way that you think when somebody like our gamera is F.

12:59:29
<transcript>: sharp so

12:59:40
thdxr: f# is great

12:59:40
moussx_: Even the rest, Twitter has a huge webserver in scala called Finatra which was pretty popular when I was doing Scala. No idea for front-end stuff though, probably react??

12:59:46
nexxeln: wow f# is just like ocaml adam

12:59:47
<transcript>: Sharp. So it's also functional. We have a lot of functional nerds at samus. So I'm around a lot of functional programming nerds. And one of them said something about how it just makes you think about programming so differently and that they just enjoy programming more because they're using functional programming languages. Like it tickles your brain a little bit.

12:59:47
<transcript>: like

12:59:51
<transcript>: Like you don't think in the same way that you think when you're writing like JavaScript or typescript.

12:59:51
<transcript>: so in that sense

12:59:57
thdxr: yeah

13:00:04
<transcript>: So in that sense, it's fun, but it is untyped. Our code base is huge. It's giant. And because of that, it's very slow. Like the lsp gives me information, like five minutes after I make a change. So it's kind of pointless.

13:00:04
<transcript>: okay

13:00:07
thdxr: ocaml but you can use the dotnet ecosystem

13:00:12
<transcript>: Okay, seven. Tv App Store I'm going to open that link right now because I want to look at that later. I want some colors on my name.

13:00:15
<transcript>: Okay, welcome to chat.

13:00:20
fragaverage: @privann We pay $25 * 5, with about 1m views

13:00:25
<transcript>: Legit boomi can't be in versailles. Less about scale, more about versailles being too shallow. Yeah, I know exactly. If you're building a back end at all.

13:00:44
<transcript>: Then. Yeah. Forcell is just kind of more pain than it's worth. What is boomi? We don't have traffic scale, but we have incredible complexity. My wife and I have company to call boomi. Okay. Versaille. Where we're at versailles, wants us to pay $8,000 per month for five sites with about one to 2 million views combined. Yeah.

13:00:48
<transcript>: It gets expensive once you get out of that free tier.

13:00:48
<transcript>: it can be

13:00:50
<transcript>: It can be trouble.

13:01:04
<transcript>: F. Sharp is great. Even the rest. Twitter has a huge web server in scala called Fintech. Oh, okay. I didn't know this pretty proper when I was doing scala. No idea for fun and stuff though. Probably react. Yeah, probably. I don't know. What is Twitter? What is the front end of Twitter? Anybody know.

13:01:04
<transcript>: f shar

13:01:08
iannery: twitter is a mess

13:01:11
<transcript>: F sharp is just like Ocammel really. I mean, I wrote a lot of F sharp in my early days at sat Mews while we were building out gamera.

13:01:11
<transcript>: i

13:01:12
privann: @FragAverage I think they wanted us to use some enterprise thingy

13:01:17
<transcript>: I stopped working on camera a few years in and focused more on front end stuff, but.

13:01:17
<transcript>: definitely

13:01:26
<transcript>: Definitely wrote a lot F sharp. And I think I do remember enjoying F sharp because it has like an actual type system. Right? It's net. So you've got the whole type system.

13:01:26
<transcript>: if

13:01:33
<transcript>: If I recall, I really did enjoy F. Sharp. That was back in the day when I knew what things like currying was.

13:01:33
<transcript>: i don't even

13:01:36
<transcript>: I don't even remember anymore currying.

13:01:36
<transcript>: that

13:01:46
<transcript>: That was always fun. I loved that there was a concept in programming that had Curry in it because I love Curry. I'm just a big fan. Yellow Curry, especially potatoes and carrots.

13:01:47
privann: I remember that offer as my boss send a slack say "heeyyy, we need to move all our next sites to AWS cuz Vercel want us to pay to much"

13:01:50
schrew: to me "currying" means curly brace helll

13:01:56
privann: so we moved all apps to AWS

13:01:56
<transcript>: Okay, well, but you can use the Net ecosystem. Yeah, it was great. F sharp is great. I mean, we still use a ten F sharp. We paid $25 times five with about 1 million views. Twitter is a mess.

13:01:56
kampouse: you make me hungry !

13:02:05
<transcript>: Okay, remember that offer as my boss sent us slack saying, hey, we need to move all our next I save. Yes, that's funny.

13:02:05
<transcript>: currying

13:02:06
thdxr: I was at a meetup dinner once and a white girl explained to me that curry always has mango in it

13:02:21
<transcript>: Currying means curly brace. Hell. Oh, no, I don't even remember what it is so I can't comment on that. Oh, I got more tweets to read. Let's read the rest of these tweets, and I got to get to it move. All. After I was at a meeting dinner once and a white girl explained to me that Curry always has mango in it. What doesn't.

13:02:21
<transcript>: tw

13:02:21
thdxr: I referred to something without mango as curry

13:02:22
nexxeln: @Schrew use haskell and no brackets

13:02:28
<transcript>: Twitter here's code from a real react codebase. Oh, I saw this, dax, what in the world is this.

13:02:31
fragaverage: @privann Yeah they will try upselling you all the time. The key is not to bite LUL

13:02:32
<transcript>: Someone please? Oh, Yeah.

13:02:35
<transcript>: Someone please explain to me.

13:02:35
<transcript>: dax what's

13:02:45
<transcript>: Dax, what's the deal? Why is it comparing to these emojis? And why is there, like multiplying by 9.320,766.36? What is going on.

13:02:45
<transcript>: in this code

13:02:46
<transcript>: In this code.

13:02:48
thdxr: me and Alan consulting at a company and I saw this and I was like "Alan will be working on frontend"

13:02:49
iannery: key*5.56 gets me

13:02:49
<transcript>: I am so confused.

13:02:51
kryotoboi: Currying is when your code smells like curry

13:02:52
<transcript>: Please explain it.

13:02:56
glamshatterskull: LUL

13:02:57
<transcript>: It's a simple table, though simply table data.

13:02:59
m3talstorm: @privann We do about a billion requests/month for about $5000 in prod, Vercel is a ripoff

13:03:02
kampouse: this code should be rewritten by chatgpt

13:03:04
<transcript>: Me and Allen consulted at a company, and I saw this. And I was like Allen will be working on front end.

13:03:06
vimcerf: when your arrow function is a page long, you've messed up

13:03:08
terawatthour: @Iannery american thing to do

13:03:08
<transcript>: Oh, that's funny. Oh, man.

13:03:08
<transcript>: billion requests

13:03:15
<transcript>: Billion requests a month for about $5,000 in prod Versailles rip off this code should be rewritten in job by jeb TV oh my goodness.

13:03:15
<transcript>: dax do you

13:03:27
<transcript>: Dax, do you have a way to copy that code? Because I'm not typing it. But if you could put that into Chat gbt and ask it to rewrite it, please, to make more sense. I would love that so much. That would be good content, right there. Great content.

13:03:28
thdxr: idk maybe Alan still works there (loser)

13:03:33
lasamat: Sell me on elixir like its a religion and I go to hell if I don't learn it

13:03:42
<transcript>: Okay, next is stay in search mode in vim by using Control G. What time is it right now? Eight. Okay, we're good by using Control D and Control T. After searching for a pattern, instead of pressing enter, refine your pattern. Fascia this way.

13:03:42
<transcript>: what

13:03:59
<transcript>: What? Savim tip vimtrix. Okay, stay in search mode by using oh, I've done this before. I remember looking up. Like, is there a way if I just need to move a little bit and you just need to make one little move, but I don't want to exit insert mode. I remember looking that up. And this is how you do it. Control. G. Control. T.

13:04:06
<transcript>: Wait. What? Oh, this is not what I thought it was. I think for the follow macro shell.

13:04:09
<transcript>: Did I say that? Right? Macro shell.

13:04:09
<transcript>: so

13:04:11
<transcript>: So.

13:04:11
<transcript>: i've searched

13:04:17
<transcript>: I've searched for rescue, and then I hit ctrl G or Control T. Instead of pressing enter.

13:04:17
<transcript>: what is it

13:04:22
<transcript>: What is it do? Oh, it moves me around without leaving.

13:04:30
<transcript>: Like without leaving insert mode down there on the search. Is that what it is? Oh, that's cool. Hey, that's a good tip.

13:04:30
<transcript>: in and

13:04:35
<transcript>: In and P works like a charm. Okay, I love it. Thank you for the tip.

13:04:35
<transcript>: i don't know

13:04:38
<transcript>: I don't know. Maybe Alan still works there.

13:04:40
cra5h16: I jumped to another team to help them catch their release deadline.   The teamlead was a former Java guy. I writte OOP react now :) extending stuff and all that nightmare thingys :) (screams for help silently)

13:04:43
<transcript>: Somehow looks are like it's a religion, and I go to hell if I don't learn it well.

13:04:43
<transcript>: i don't believe

13:04:46
<transcript>: I don't believe that Lassa.

13:04:49
<transcript>: Here's my thing.

13:04:49
<transcript>: i think

13:04:53
<transcript>: I think functional programming is fun. It's fun.

13:04:53
<transcript>: certain thank

13:04:55

13:04:55
<transcript>: surgery

13:05:01
iannery: Sell me on vim like its a religion and I go to hell if I don't learn it

13:05:01
kampouse: clojure is so fun

13:05:06
<transcript>: Surgery. I think it's fun. I think it's weird that people get so into it. I don't understand that. Why is there such a vibe around functional programmers where they're like, religious about it.

13:05:13
thdxr: I was half way into a set and the music in my gym turned off and Adams voice was blasting from my phone

13:05:14
privann: "Sell me on elixir like its a religion and I go to hell if I don't learn it" SO TRUE

13:05:16
<transcript>: I jump to another team to help them catch their release. Headline the team lead with a former java guy I write oop react now extending stuff and all that nightmare things screams for help.

13:05:19
thdxr: talking about functional programming

13:05:23
lasamat: I don't know either. Thats why I wanted you to indoctrine me LuL

13:05:31
<transcript>: Sell me on vim like it's a religion, and I go to hell if I don't win it. Now that I could say no, I'm just kidding. I don't hold anything too tightly. Closure is so fun. Is it so fun that it makes you want to worship it.

13:05:33
vimcerf: @kampouse it's fun util every answer you find is: use this built-in java function

13:05:39
kampouse: @cra5h16 sounds painful

13:05:41
<transcript>: 's Halfway Into a set? And then music in my gym turned off, and adam's voice was blasting from my phone. Oh, no. What was I talking about.

13:05:41
<transcript>: oh that's

13:05:49
<transcript>: Oh, that's awful. Lambert, thank you for the follow. I mean, I made your name up. It's not actually lambert. I just put an A where the underscore is. Is that okay.

13:06:09
kampouse: @kampouse of course you never use these you rewrite all the codebase in clojure

13:06:10
cra5h16: @kampouse  it is :) :)

13:06:13
<transcript>: Talking about functional programming. Oh, no, I sound like one of those people. That's why I wanted you to Doctor. Maybe I'm just not indoctrinated. That's right. I got it right. Lambert, are you serious? I filled in the blank. Look at me. Welcome to my chat. Lambert.

<transcript>: I'm really hungry.

13:08:25

13:08:31
<transcript>: I'm really hungry. Welcome to the great Scam. You are now involved. It's not a great Scam chip wheel or what are you using Sshar for? I love F. Sharp.

13:08:31
<transcript>: so

13:08:49
glamshatterskull: most of the internet has always been porn @cra5h16

13:08:50
<transcript>: So our gamma code base. All of our code bases are named after godzilla, monsters, gamera is our service that answers sports questions. So I'll show you what's this. So if you say, like, when was lebron drafted? When you ask a natural language question like that the service that actually.

13:08:52
caasidev: hey Adam!

13:09:03
<transcript>: Figures it out. Does the natural language processing, if you will, the nlp and the thing that does the nlg like writes the answer back. That service is called gamma. It's written in F sharp. That's what we chose F sharp for.

13:09:03
<transcript>: and

13:09:20
<transcript>: And again, we chose all these languages because somebody on the team really loved the language, and they ran with it. So the person leading up a lot of the gamera work, his name is Jay. Oh, Jay, you guys know J station. He comes in. He's one of my moderators. He hasn't been here as much lately, but jstation.

13:09:20
<transcript>: he big

13:09:52
<transcript>: probably

13:09:56
thdxr: I'm not a community builder anymore lol

13:09:59

13:10:07
<transcript>: Okay. Can't wait to get scammed. There's no scamming. Jay said some mess up stuff about you, Adam. I know he didn't. That's why he hasn't been here. Stop it.

13:10:07

13:10:23
<transcript>: lesa bots

13:10:31
<transcript>: Lesa botsy. Yes, we make our money on status from Ads today, but we're building on this very stream. What you've been watching me do.

13:10:31
<transcript>: kind of

13:10:32
<transcript>: Kind of.

13:10:32
<transcript>: is

13:10:52
<transcript>: Is build the subscription offering. We're going to offer more tools for people who use sap News for research. Something like 80,000 to 100,000 people search more than 100 times on status every month. And that's the group that we're trying to say like you're a sports better. You're a journalist, you're a fantasy player. Whatever is statues worth X dollars a month to you? I hope so.

13:10:52
<transcript>: some

13:11:01
<transcript>: Some of them just so we can move away from ads. And it's like our primary business model. We do make, like six figures a month on these video ads, which is kind of crazy.

13:11:01
<transcript>: that's

13:11:11
<transcript>: That's what happens when you have a lot of traffic. I guess so. We're doing pretty well on ad revenue, but we want to have a subscription offering that. Is that okay? I'm actually really hungry.

13:11:11
<transcript>: so

13:11:12
stoney_mcwheels: Are you on a laptop or desktop? Just curious.

13:11:14

13:16:45
<transcript>: Let's see my linux setup works better than Adams. Probably.

13:16:53

13:23:31
<transcript>: You just trying to clip that.

13:23:31
manbravegg: @ExtremelyRyan They wont, it would be financially irresponsible to do that. 99% of gamers are on windows / mac, why would studios focus on 1 % of their customer base?

13:23:41

13:23:46
<transcript>: I think Adam got paid to make that video on versailles this morning, thinking, Ten K.

13:23:46

13:24:12
<transcript>: Okay.

13:24:15
<transcript>: Let's do more work.

13:24:15
zxshan: Camera looks higher quality today

13:24:18
<transcript>: More work.

13:24:23
monsef_ot: hhhh you almost did it

13:24:24
thdxr: what's the v word?

13:24:26
<transcript>: Camera looks higher quality. It's the same camera. It's interesting, though. Same camera I'm using.

13:24:32
<transcript>: I almost did it. What's the V word? I'm not going to say it. Dax, you're not going to get me. Just stop trying.

kampouse: dont say r word  say the "feris language"

13:24:41
<transcript>: It's going to be a little tricky.

13:24:41
<transcript>: i started doing

13:24:44
<transcript>: I started doing the migration, didn't I.

13:24:48
<transcript>: Alter table users.

13:24:52
extremelyryan: @ExtremelyRyan the steam deck has sold millions of devices, you dont think they would want a piece of that market?

13:24:59

coolpantstv: Have you heard of version cells @adamdotdev

13:25:04
<transcript>: Wow, this is so complicated.

13:25:10
<transcript>: Wait. What.

13:25:11
stoney_mcwheels: do you use window management on mac? like spectacle?

13:25:14
<transcript>: Why is that create table not in quotes.

13:25:14
<transcript>: what

13:25:16
<transcript>: What.

13:25:20
lasamat: @Lasamat They are forcing usb c port IF they have a port in the first place. If they just remove it and go full wireless charging they circumvent that

13:25:25
<transcript>: You just do that in Echo migrations. You can do create table. It's like a function or something.

13:25:31
<transcript>: Cool Pants. Have you heard of Version Cells? No. What is that.

13:25:35
<transcript>: What is that.

13:25:35
<transcript>: black shirt

13:25:38
<transcript>: Black shirt is added contrast. Maybe.

13:25:41
coolpantstv: @thdxr there you go, cut that together

13:25:43
<transcript>: The challenge is set. I'm not saying the V word.

13:25:43
<transcript>: do you use wind

13:25:48
<transcript>: Do you use Window Management on Mac? Like spectacle? I use you buy, but I kind of hate it.

13:25:54
<transcript>: I've used rectangle moom. There's a bunch of stuff I've used.

13:25:55
thdxr: LOL

13:25:59
<transcript>: Altar table, users.

13:26:02
<transcript>: Default channel.

13:26:05
<transcript>: No.

13:26:05
<transcript>: alter

13:26:08
<transcript>: Alter table. Okay.

13:26:10
<transcript>: Add okay.

13:26:11
dnbull: Apple needs to include the USB-C like no one is asking for a thin phone LUL what is the obsession of trying to make it small

13:26:13
monsef_ot: vercel is so good honestly, I like it because I don't need to write bunch of Docker code in order to deploy a next app or a laravel one on GCC

13:26:14
thdxr: brilliant

13:26:16
<transcript>: So I can add a column this way. I think.

13:26:20
<transcript>: I don't need a complicated one like this.

13:26:20
<transcript>: oh

13:26:24
<transcript>: Oh, interesting. Alter table. Like that altar table.

13:26:28
<transcript>: Users.

13:26:37
thdxr: wow Guillermo here under his alt username @monsef_ot

13:26:40
kampouse: @monsef_ot but in the end you pay the extra fees for it

13:26:44
<transcript>: Add user email, confirm fields. There's some fields. Here we go. Now we're talking now we're talking.

13:26:46
kampouse: when your thing scale

13:26:49
<transcript>: Unique index. Do I need index on anything I'm going to do.

13:26:53
elicxlive: @thdxr 😂😂

13:26:59
stoney_mcwheels: mmmm I miss vim

13:27:09
<transcript>: There you go. Cut that together. What did I say? Apple needs to include the usbc. Like no one is asking for a thin phone. What is the obsession of trying to make it small.

13:27:18
manbravegg: @ExtremelyRyan That market is still minuscule compared to the overall pc / mac gaming market. Do you really think the number of steam decks sold justifies the development cost of supporting linux, when the steam deck cant even run most games due to spec limitations?

13:27:21
<transcript>: The V word is so good. Honestly, I like it because I don't need to write a bunch of Docker code in order to deploy an X app or larvae one on gcc. Wow, guillermo here under his alt.

13:27:27
<transcript>: That's funny. In the end you pay the extra fees for it when your thing scales.

13:27:27
<transcript>: okay

13:27:28
<transcript>: Okay.

13:27:29
thdxr: everyone focusing on vercel's price but that's the thing I don't care that much about

13:27:32
<transcript>: So question.

13:27:35
<transcript>: Do I need an index.

13:27:37
<transcript>: Do I need.

13:27:37
<transcript>: an index

13:27:38
<transcript>: An index.

13:27:38
<transcript>: that is

13:27:40
<transcript>: That is the question.

13:27:44
<transcript>: Let's think about this.

13:27:44
<transcript>: i'm adding

13:27:45
<transcript>: I'm adding.

13:27:45
<transcript>: up

13:27:47
greatgrievance: @thdxr right? whats an hour of your time worth?

13:27:48
<transcript>: Up and down, I'm adding.

13:27:48
<transcript>: what

13:27:52
<transcript>: What is change versus up and down.

13:27:58
<transcript>: So alter Table users. We're going to add a column called.

13:28:03
<transcript>: Subscription status.

13:28:10
<transcript>: Null. That means it can be null, right? Because, yes, it can be null.

13:28:10
<transcript>: so

13:28:19
<transcript>: So this would be null true? Or is it default to that anybody know? Am I going to have to actually read the docs, read the manual.

13:28:19
<transcript>: everyone

13:28:23
<transcript>: Everyone focusing on v's. Price, but that's the thing I don't care that much about.

13:28:24
thdxr: yeah I don't like vercel because they're racist

13:28:26
<transcript>: What do you care about DAX.

13:28:34
<transcript>: I mean, I care that it's impossible to move away from like if you take advantage of next js features. I don't like V because.

13:28:36
<transcript>: They're.

13:28:36
lukeyfam15: Hello Adam!

13:28:42
<transcript>: Wow. Dax, you're really trying to get me to say something like this? What are you going to put it in? Luke is here.

13:28:45
<transcript>: What's going on? Luki. It's been a long time.

13:28:58
<transcript>: Farming clips Wow.

13:28:58
<transcript>: you really

13:29:03
<transcript>: You really are. Dax. You're really trying to get me. I'm not going to do it.

13:29:05
<transcript>: That would ruin me.

13:29:10
<transcript>: I mean, that wouldn't ruin me, but.

13:29:10
<transcript>: it would just be really em

13:29:12
<transcript>: It would just be really embarrassing.

13:29:15
dnbull: @thdxr pls fix weather, thx :(

13:29:18
<transcript>: So if I want it to be nullable, do I just leave null false off.

13:29:28
monsef_ot: @monsef_ot I have three apps deployed on vercel and I haven't paid anything hhh I hope adam will not read this message

13:29:28
<transcript>: Because that may just actually be helpful. Please. Like dax, instead of trying to catch me saying bad things, could you just be helpful? Maybe I need some help. Okay. Ecto migration.

13:29:30
coolpantstv: I asked you about version cell, a new framework. Maybe you have seen it's other name ver.cell

13:29:35
greatgrievance: i believe fields are nullable by default

13:29:35
<transcript>: Nullable. I could have just gotten answer from dax. But now I'm here in Google. I'm doing this.

13:29:38
lukeyfam15: I think I was here yesterday but you didn't see my message

13:29:42
<transcript>: What is the correct syntax for declaring the common and Echo migration should have a default value of null.

13:29:43
thdxr: @dnbull dude my dog keeps looking outside and crying to me like I can fix it

13:29:51
<transcript>: The default default is null. If you add a Noble column and don't specify default, that column will use null as its default value.

13:30:02
<transcript>: It says in the docs that are options no when false column does not allow no values so you can set your truth you like. But as whatever mentioned it's the default isn't necessary, so I don't need to add that. Okay.

13:30:02
<transcript>: delet

13:30:03
dnbull: @thdxr luckily, I found a very small window 10 mins ago. My dog was crying too :D

13:30:13
<transcript>: Delete to there. Okay. So then the question is, do I need an index for this? No, I'm not going to query on whether I'm not going to query subscription status, right.

13:30:17
<transcript>: Don't need to drop? I do need to remove.

13:30:17
<transcript>: subscription

13:30:19
<transcript>: Subscription status.

13:30:24
lasamat: I think the name "neovim" is just wrong. Unlike us Neo could actually exit

13:30:30
<transcript>: Hello, glass Animals. So much. Okay. Am I going to need other columns? Let's think about this.

13:30:30
<transcript>: let's think about

13:30:34
<transcript>: Let's think about this. What other columns am I going to need for stripe.

13:30:47
extremelyryan: @ExtremelyRyan the number of units sold is obv. important. idk why you are saying it cant run most games, when you can google all of the AAA games it can run

13:30:51
dnbull: customerId from stripe?

13:30:51
<transcript>: No, I think I was here yesterday if you didn't see my message. Oh, I'm so sorry, luki. Sometimes I don't see every message I've had to come to grips with. That that I can't read every message because I do need to actually work. But I hate when I miss somebody's message. So now I'm probably going to try to read every message again.

13:30:55
greatgrievance: stripe will give you a customer id

13:31:00
<transcript>: Please fix weather. Oh, you guys have bad weather in Miami, I have three apps deployed on versaille, and I haven't paid anything. I hope Adam will not read this message.

13:31:24
<transcript>: It's great. It's fantastic. I love it for so many things, but it's just also not like the only thing I will ever use. And I don't think anyone should have that mentality. And I don't know. Maybe nobody does. Maybe I'm getting all worked up and nobody thinks that nobody's like, of course, it doesn't work for everything.

13:31:30
thdxr: Lol you're screwed now

13:31:30
<transcript>: Or nobody is like that. Nobody's like. Of course it works for everything. I don't know.

13:31:30
<transcript>: i asked you about

13:31:35
<transcript>: I asked you about Version Cell, a new framework. Maybe you have seen its other name.

13:31:36
gitpush_gitpaid: how have you been streaming for 2 hours already and 100+ people in here? whats going on?

<transcript>: A mod. You and I'm going to drop dax's mod because my moderators, they need to be helpful.

13:31:53
<transcript>: they need to

13:31:59
<transcript>: They need to solve my code problems. That's a requirement of being a moderator for me.

13:32:29
thdxr: I don't fix all of Adams problems for one day and I get punished

13:32:31
<transcript>: I think the name Neil vim is just wrong. Unlike us, neo could actually exit. How's it going? Laza? The number of units sold is obviously important now. Okay, what are we talking about? Customer ID. Customer ID? Yes, thank you. Stripe. Customer ID. I'm going to need that. What else am I going to need? Optional additional data. But for the user, you really just need the customer ID to resolve everything else.

13:32:43
<transcript>: I want to make sure and get ahead of any database changes.

13:32:44

13:32:47
<transcript>: Maybe I should start implementing before.

13:32:47
<transcript>: i try

13:32:50
<transcript>: I try and decide if I need stuff.

13:32:54
<transcript>: Stripe Customer ID.

13:32:54
greatgrievance: so you can resolve users from a transaction record

13:32:56
manbravegg: @ExtremelyRyan To take it even further people even go as far as to remove linux and put windows on their steamdeck to run certain games due to os compatibility issues. What about all of the steam decks running windows. So the market of people even running the steam os on their steamdeck is lower than the overall devices sold.

13:33:00
<transcript>: Maybe I should just start building the stripe stuff, and then I'll figure out what I need on the table.

13:33:06
<transcript>: Okay, I'm screwed. Now don't do it, dax. It's going to look so cut up and fake.

13:33:09
<transcript>: So fake.

13:33:15
<transcript>: Delete all the code no code problem are we finally purging mods let's vote.

13:33:23
<transcript>: That's funny. Now that I'm a partner, I have new requirements on my mods. You have to be good and helpful.

13:33:39
dnbull: I'd say we get rid of Fossabot, that mod doesn't do anything

13:33:42
elicxlive: Add some voice synthesis and deep fake to stitch it all together and it'll seem as realistic as ever 👀

13:33:43
<transcript>: And no cutting up words that I say to make it look like I'm making racist claims on my streams. I don't fix all of adam's problems for one day, and I get punished. You're not punished yet, dax. I'm just noticing. I'm putting you on notice. It's a pip. Okay, you haven't been punished yet? Firing someone on a fake job is not cool. Sorry, Lisa.

13:33:43
<transcript>: you

13:33:47
<transcript>: You would index so you can resolve users from a transaction record. Yeah, I agree.

13:33:47
<transcript>: good

13:33:50
<transcript>: Good call good call.

13:33:54

13:34:15
<transcript>: it's going to be

13:34:19
greatgrievance: it is unique, but you dont need to enforce the constraint yourself

13:34:20
<transcript>: It's going to be index on stripe Customer ID and then no additional.

13:34:20
<transcript>: probably no

13:34:22
thdxr: good point @jokestera_e

13:34:23
<transcript>: Probably no additional. Right.

13:34:26
<transcript>: Like that.

13:34:49
<transcript>: You guys are still talking about stuff. I'd say we get rid of fossil bot. That mod doesn't do anything. It does such good work here. Add some voice into this and deep fake to stitch it all together and it'll seem as realistic as ever. Stop it, Alex. You're giving them ideas. I don't need racist takes out on the internet from my voice. Modding is free Labor.

13:34:50

<transcript>: Thank you so much for the follow. Can. What was it? Cam slaughter? I appreciate your follow.

13:36:52
<transcript>: So it's going to be index.

13:36:52
<transcript>: it's going to be

13:36:54
<transcript>: It's going to be users.

13:36:57
<transcript>: Stripe Customer ID.

13:36:59
<transcript>: Yes.

kampouse: @nft_scam nft scam with deepfake OWO

13:37:01
<transcript>: I need to drop the index.

13:37:07
<transcript>: Okay. I think I need to start implementing the stripe stuff so I can.

13:37:07
<transcript>: know better

13:37:08
<transcript>: Know better.

13:37:14
<transcript>: Drop index.

13:37:17
<transcript>: Do.

13:37:21
<transcript>: Index.

13:37:21
<transcript>: this one

13:37:23
<transcript>: This one doesn't do it.

13:37:24
nft_scam: @nft_scam LUL

13:37:26
<transcript>: Drop.

13:37:26
<transcript>: index

13:37:27
<transcript>: Index.

13:37:27
<transcript>: just

13:37:29
<transcript>: Just want examples.

13:37:32
<transcript>: Oh, wow, yes. Put the whole thing in there.

13:37:37
<transcript>: Whole thing. I hate database migrations. Can I just be honest.

13:37:37
<transcript>: this

13:37:40
<transcript>: This is the worst.

13:37:50
<transcript>: I love dynamodb. I know it's not getting rid of the problem. I'm just ignoring the problem, but I like ignoring it. Okay. I enjoy my ignorance.

13:37:53
<transcript>: Index users.

13:37:56
<transcript>: No.

13:38:00
<transcript>: Stripe Customer ID.

13:38:00
<transcript>: i

13:38:01
<transcript>: I enjoy.

13:38:01
<transcript>: just ignoring

13:38:03
<transcript>: Just ignoring it.

13:38:05
greatgrievance: DocumentDB is even more forgiving

13:38:07
<transcript>: Okay.

13:38:13
<transcript>: So we have users stripe Customer ID as an index so we can look up the customer.

13:38:13
<transcript>: in the webho

13:38:15
<transcript>: In the webhooks and such.

13:38:16
thdxr: can you store this data in ddb

13:38:18
<transcript>: What else.

13:38:18
<transcript>: can you store

13:38:22
<transcript>: Can you store this data in dynamodb.

13:38:22
<transcript>: interesting

13:38:23
<transcript>: Interesting.

13:38:27
kampouse: just use google spreasheet

13:38:29
<transcript>: I could.

13:38:35
greatgrievance: figuring out all the access patterns upfront might be a pain

13:38:37
gitpush_gitpaid: "working on statmuse.com" i see you with the growth hack and light flex Adam

13:38:37
<transcript>: Why why couldn't I? So if I sorted in dynamodb, I would have to modify.

13:38:42
<transcript>: Mothra to connect to dynamodb that sounds.

13:38:42
<transcript>: not fun

13:38:43
<transcript>: Not fun.

13:38:47
<transcript>: That sounds not fun, actually.

13:39:01
<transcript>: Git Push working on sammy's. Com. I see you with the Growth hack and Light flex. Is that a light flex? I mean, I'm the co founder of stat muse. I feel like just telling you I'm working on it today. Is that flexing or is that just acknowledging my greatness.

13:39:03
<transcript>: That was flexing.

13:39:05
greatgrievance: @gitpush_gitpaid LuckyEnergy dollar62Hype

13:39:11
<transcript>: So I think I need to stick with sql. I mean stick with postgres because.

13:39:18
<transcript>: I don't want to make mothra connect to dynamo as much as I hate it.

13:39:25
<transcript>: Interesting. It's making me think dax. It's making me think at least.

13:39:25
<transcript>: zik

13:39:30
<transcript>: Ziko. Thank you for that. Follow. Appreciate your follow. Zeco.

13:39:50
<transcript>: Let's see. I guess I'm going to start implementing okay. I want to go back over here and do the 25 limit thing because I feel like I'm not on pace to complete a thing today. And I want to feel like on stream I did something. I wrapped something up in a nice little bow, and that bow is going to be okay. So there's subscription status.

13:39:51
aj_stuyvenberg: ahhhh elixir reads so nicely

13:39:53
<transcript>: We'll uncomment that later.

13:39:55
<transcript>: I want to limit.

13:40:02
<transcript>: The results of queries, that's going to be tricky. It's going to be tricky, everybody.

13:40:02
<transcript>: not going to be

13:40:04
<transcript>: Not going to be easy.

13:40:08
greatgrievance: @aj_stuyvenberg pattern matching is an amazing tool

13:40:15
<transcript>: Because we're kind of like inspecting gamma payloads, and those are not really meant to be inspected. They are meant to be just passed along. I think we're going to find out.

13:40:15
<transcript>: aj

13:40:26
<transcript>: Aj elixir reads so nicely, doesn't it? It reads so nicely. I did take forever yesterday to work out a problem that I could have solved very fast in typescript, because there's no types.

13:40:35
<transcript>: Pattern matching is an amazing tool. Yeah. I love doing functional programming in doses.

13:40:35
<transcript>: in smallish

13:40:37
<transcript>: In smallish doses.

13:40:37
<transcript>: i

13:40:43
<transcript>: I do it enough that I don't get sucked in. And I don't start just like telling random people on the street about functional programming.

13:40:43
<transcript>: i do it just enough

13:40:46
aj_stuyvenberg: match tru

13:40:48
<transcript>: I do it just enough to get the nice little brain feeling a little tickle, little tickle in your brain.

13:40:48
<transcript>: but not

13:40:52
<transcript>: But not enough to be obnoxious.

13:40:52
<transcript>: rel

13:40:54
<transcript>: Religious about it.

13:40:54
<transcript>: okay

13:40:56
<transcript>: Okay. So here.

13:40:56
<transcript>: we have

13:40:57
aj_stuyvenberg: careful you're gonna be one of those rust crabs soon

13:40:57
<transcript>: We have.

13:40:57

13:40:59
kampouse: where the endofunctor ?

13:41:03
<transcript>: Let's see. I can do it in one spot. Render, ask.

13:41:07
<transcript>: I think I could do it right here. Can I.

13:41:07
<transcript>: i

13:41:10
<transcript>: I do it in one spot. Finally. What is this.

13:41:10
<transcript>: berlin

13:41:15
<transcript>: Berlin Version Two So, if I render Ask, what is this.

13:41:22
<transcript>: How could I render the page one time with this logic.

13:41:28
<transcript>: So we have all these overloads that's an error.

13:41:31
<transcript>: Put view, show, visual.

13:41:35
<transcript>: So that's the view show visual.

13:41:35
<transcript>: player bi

13:41:40
<transcript>: Player bio. Oh, it's different depending on the yeah. So maybe we only do this.

13:41:44
<transcript>: On prompts. We don't need to touch.

13:41:44
<transcript>: unknown

13:41:45
<transcript>: Unknown. Okay.

13:41:45
<transcript>: i think

13:41:49
<transcript>: I think I just need to focus on answer.

13:41:49
<transcript>: type answer

13:41:52
<transcript>: Type answer right here. This is where I need to actually.

13:41:52
<transcript>: peek

13:41:55
<transcript>: Peek at the payload.

13:41:57
<transcript>: And.

13:42:11
<transcript>: Maybe make some changes to it. This could get ugly, but here we go. So the way we're going to do it, it's like I'm going to redact. I'm going to give, like, the count. How do I want to do this? Should we do this in camera? Actually.

13:42:15
<transcript>: Where the Indofunctor? What's an indofunctor.

13:42:18
<transcript>: Someone tell me what an Indofunctor is.

13:42:23
<transcript>: Carefully. You're going to be one of those rust crabs soon.

13:42:28
<transcript>: Okay. So I need to touch the data.

13:42:28
<transcript>: i need

13:42:30
<transcript>: I need to touch it.

13:42:33
<transcript>: What is an ask anyway.

13:42:35
<transcript>: An ask.

13:42:35
<transcript>: is

13:42:37
<transcript>: Is this thing.

13:42:41
<transcript>: It has the answer which.

13:42:41
<transcript>: is a

13:42:42
jokestera_e: @aj_stuyvenberg He can't he's not affiliated with the Rust Foundation

13:42:43
<transcript>: Is a answer.

13:42:45
<transcript>: Okay.

13:42:52
<transcript>: So I'm going to make a function on this thing.

13:42:54
<transcript>: The answer thing.

13:43:01
<transcript>: Where is there? Like a grid. Yes. Get into these rows. Yes.

13:43:06
kampouse: maybe he is

13:43:09
<transcript>: We have awareness of rows getting entities from top rows and first grids of first visual detail.

13:43:09
<transcript>: okay

13:43:10
<transcript>: Okay.

13:43:14
<transcript>: I need a function in here that.

13:43:14
<transcript>: can

13:43:16
<transcript>: Can.

13:43:16
<transcript>: scrub some

13:43:18
<transcript>: Scrub some of the rows.

13:43:18
<transcript>: okay

13:43:20
<transcript>: Okay.

13:43:22
<transcript>: Let's see.

13:43:28
<transcript>: Get entities, rows.

13:43:32
<transcript>: So if I want to have a function.

13:43:35
<transcript>: Called.

13:43:38
<transcript>: Doc.

13:43:42
<transcript>: Given answer.

13:43:45
<transcript>: Limit.

13:43:45
<transcript>: grid

13:43:48
<transcript>: Grid rows. Okay.

13:43:54
<transcript>: Could copilot just do this for me. That'd be great.

13:43:54
<transcript>: def come on cop

13:43:57
<transcript>: Def. Come on, copilot. All right.

13:43:59

13:44:03
<transcript>: That's not all of it, though.

13:44:06
<transcript>: Could you give me more, please.

13:44:09

13:44:36
kampouse: your copilot is hecka  slow shit

13:44:39
<transcript>: Get entities. Rows. Oh, it's actually getting the rows.

13:44:39
<transcript>: it's so

13:44:44
<transcript>: It's so smart? Why is it so slow? Why is my copilot so slow.

13:44:47
<transcript>: Hit question text.

13:44:52
<transcript>: Is this a whole buffer? Did it put the whole buffer in here.

13:44:53
gitpush_gitpaid: copilot is trash

13:44:58
<transcript>: Put the whole thing in there, okay.

13:45:01
<transcript>: So get entities, rows.

13:45:04
<transcript>: What is happening here.

13:45:10
<transcript>: This copilot.

13:45:13
jokestera_e: I would read what it wants to do because sometimes i creates blocks that don't make sense

13:45:14
<transcript>: That was no good. Okay, limit. Rows.

13:45:14
<transcript>: we're just

13:45:20
<transcript>: We're just going to figure this out. We're going to write code the old fashioned way. Oh, no. We're going to use Chat, gbt.

13:45:20
<transcript>: that

13:45:32
<transcript>: That's not the old fashioned way, natty man. Thank you for the follow. Appreciate it. Copilot needs a coffee. Yeah, it's struggling. Zecho. Then welcome to Chat. Used to be a C Plus plus.

13:45:32
<transcript>: then rail

13:45:37
<transcript>: Then rails Guy, then python Guy. And now learning love and golang, this has given me grails, flashbacks.

m2devdotnet: ChatGPT is at capacity ;9

13:45:49
<transcript>: I've never used grails, but I used to be a python guy, and I've done a lot of golang. I don't know. I was just trying to find things in common, things that we have come.

inoriffic: Hey adam

13:45:57
<transcript>: What's the name of the natural language AI used in stat Music in Where can I get more info on that? So nft scam it's actually homespun.

13:45:57
<transcript>: we started on

13:46:04
greatgrievance: My journey has been PHP -> JS -> Elixir -> TS

13:46:07
zekodun: SeemsGood

13:46:17
<transcript>: We started on it nine years ago. That was the first thing I built was like at the time I called it lex fetch, like, lexical Aware fetching from a database. But it's technology that takes a natural language question has a bunch of metadata about your database schema. And it figures out how to craft a query based on your natural language question. That's the technology we first built.

13:46:17
<transcript>: at stat

13:46:21
<transcript>: At Status using a variety of tools over the years.

13:46:21
<transcript>: mostly

13:46:25
<transcript>: Mostly it's a bunch of Stanford nlp stuff which is very dated in today.

13:46:25
<transcript>: 's

13:46:32
<transcript>: 's sexy AI world where you're just like, I just hand it text and it gives me magic back.

13:46:32
<transcript>: it is not that

13:46:36
<transcript>: It is not that it's much more heuristic much more.

13:46:36
<transcript>: manual eff

13:46:42
<transcript>: Manual effort, but at the same time much more accurate. So it doesn't hallucinate.

13:46:48
moussx_: It's cheaper to run too isn't it?

13:46:58
nft_scam: SeemsGood ahhh okok

13:46:58
<transcript>: Our natural language engine is pretty good at answering most sports questions, and if we don't know the answer, we're even pretty good at telling you we can't answer it because this we know enough about our data and enough about our schema to say, like we don't have data for that so we can't answer it.

13:46:58
<transcript>: so

13:47:04
<transcript>: So it's a pretty good experience as a user of status, but it's not something that's public.

13:47:04
<transcript>: it's all

13:47:10
<transcript>: It's all internal stuff. We are looking to open source, like all of stat muse. We just haven't gotten there yet.

13:47:10
<transcript>: because we

13:47:13
<transcript>: Because we didn't build it with that in mind.

13:47:14
moussx_: (home made lexfetch, cheaper than running a model to process NL)

13:47:16
<transcript>: Chachi BT is at capacity no.

13:47:21
<transcript>: Are you serious? I would read what it wants to do because sometimes I create blocks that don't make sense.

13:47:21
<transcript>: hello

13:47:32
m2devdotnet: Yep, been waiting to ask it a question - get in line Adam!

13:47:33
<transcript>: Hello. I know riffic. Is that an L or an I welcome to my chat. I know riffic. My journey has been PHP JS elixir typescript. Nice. Okay.

13:47:33
<transcript>: i actually

13:47:39
gitpush_gitpaid: if you had chatgpt 4 you wouldnt be at capacity

13:47:44
<transcript>: I actually did do a little bit of php. Early in my career. I built some things with php, so not too dissimilar from my experience, although I think I probably wrote typescript before I wrote elixir. Probably actually I don't know.

13:47:50
<transcript>: It's cheaper to run, too, isn't it? Than what? What is cheaper to run.

13:47:50
<transcript>: home

13:47:57
<transcript>: Homemade lexus. Cheaper than running a model to process. Yeah. Oh, yeah, it is. It's free. I mean, it's whatever our compute costs are.

Wow. Okay, actually, my first language is probably action script. I probably broke. I probably wrote slash websites before I did anything else. Which that's taken me way back.

13:48:19
<transcript>: Cold fusion. That's some old school.

13:48:23
<transcript>: Okay, we're going to use Chad gbt to.

13:48:23
<transcript>: what

13:48:24
gitpush_gitpaid: it doesnt say capacity for me

13:48:25
<transcript>: What? What is it going to do.

13:48:26
glamshatterskull: when it was owned by allaire too

13:48:27

13:48:30
<transcript>: given

13:48:31
gitpush_gitpaid: should i ask it

13:48:32
<transcript>: Given. Let's see given this code.

13:48:35
<transcript>: Let's see.

13:48:35
<transcript>: get

13:48:41
<transcript>: Get entities rows. Oh, it gets the top rows. Oh, this already does this.

13:48:41
<transcript>: wow

13:48:44
<transcript>: Wow, it already does. It.

13:48:46
<transcript>: So like if I just did this.

13:48:46
<transcript>: i'm going to copy

13:48:52
<transcript>: I'm going to copy this code. This already takes the count in returns, but I want to then.

13:48:52
<transcript>: i want to

13:48:55
<transcript>: I want to make a function that.

13:48:58
<transcript>: Okay.

13:49:04
<transcript>: Following elixir functions.

13:49:10
<transcript>: Extract.

13:49:15
<transcript>: Grid rows, or extract rows.

13:49:19
<transcript>: From grids.

13:49:23
<transcript>: I need a function that.

13:49:30
<transcript>: Replaces the thank you so much that replaces the rows.

13:49:31
kampouse: what is the  nvim  your completion plugin>

13:49:33
<transcript>: In place.

13:49:40
<transcript>: With a subset of the rows.

13:49:42
zekodun: I remember CF and Flash, that was the hot newness back when I was already writing CGI and HTML2 sites or converting frontpage stuff over to perl/apache

13:49:44
<transcript>: When given a count.

13:49:48
<transcript>: county na

13:49:48
<transcript>: county naji thank

13:49:58
<transcript>: County. Naji. Thank you for the follow. I appreciate your follow. Naji. What are we talking about here? What is the nvim your completion plugin? I use CMP.

13:49:58
<transcript>: i use cmp

13:50:02
<transcript>: I use cmp, I use the github copilot cmp plugin.

13:50:03
sockthedev: did anyone get a macbook yet?

13:50:15
<transcript>: But mine was turbo Delphi Delphi. I don't even know what that is when it was owned by a layer. Wow, old school. It doesn't say capacity for me. Yeah. Gbt four is working for me.

13:50:20
<transcript>: I remember cf, cold fusion and flash.

13:50:20
<transcript>: that was

13:50:28
<transcript>: That was the hot newness back when I was already riding cgi and html two sites or converting front page shove over to Pearl and apache so.

13:50:28
<transcript>: i yeah

13:50:31
<transcript>: I yeah, I started with Action Script. I think.

13:50:31
<transcript>: did anyone

13:50:37
<transcript>: Did anyone get a macbook? Not yet. Sock. But it's not a scam. Just wait for it. Not a scam.

m2devdotnet: How do I get to ChatGPT4? Is that the Plus?

13:50:47
<transcript>: Somebody's going to win. It's a zero 1% chance. It's not a big chance. I never said it was a big chance. It's just a chance. A chance at a MacBook.

13:50:49
binajmen: that's not what dax said

13:50:52
glamshatterskull: my first js was onMouseOver LUL

13:50:58
<transcript>: So I was writing action script building flash sites. I think I was writing php. I was writing some sites with php. Two in my early, early freelancing days.

13:50:58
<transcript>: and then

13:51:02
<transcript>: And then it was mostly. I moved into Net. C. Sharp.

13:51:26
<transcript>: Those were the days.

13:51:26
<transcript>: just as

13:51:32
<transcript>: Just as long as somebody was okay installing silver light in their browser, you could build some cool stuff. Okay. What.

13:51:32
<transcript>: is this saying grid

13:51:33
sockthedev: i remember silverlight lol

13:51:37
nft_scam: i dont know any of those LUL

13:51:41
thdxr: dude silver light

13:51:41
<transcript>: Is this saying, grid, replace rows in a given grid with a subset of count rows. Enum. Take grit. What? Did they see? My function. Oh, did I not paste it.

13:51:43
thdxr: throwback

13:51:45
<transcript>: I forgot to paste it. I forgot to paste the function.

13:51:49
sirterenced: OMG! I did a ton of silverlight

13:51:50
<transcript>: No. Okay, cool.

13:51:51
thdxr: remember Netflix used to be powered by that

13:51:52
sockthedev: i actually forgot about it

13:51:52
<transcript>: Well.

13:51:56
<transcript>: The follow.

13:51:56
<transcript>: okay

13:52:01
<transcript>: Okay. The following. What was I doing? The following elixir functions. Extract rows from grid.

13:52:03
<transcript>: Okay.

13:52:07
<transcript>: All.

13:52:07
<transcript>: let's see

13:52:15
<transcript>: I'm using my mouse, people, this is my mouse. Look at me. I'm a real neo vim user.

13:52:15
<transcript>: okay

13:52:16
<transcript>: Okay. Copy. All that.

13:52:17
zekodun: silverlight.. lolz use to have gray hat fun with that :D

13:52:19
<transcript>: And then.

13:52:19
<transcript>: paste

13:52:21
<transcript>: Paste it here.

binajmen: My first language was in mIRC, I was building plugins to spam channels using proxies xD

13:52:23
<transcript>: No.

13:52:23
<transcript>: i just copied

13:52:25
natyman48: What are the current preferred web frameworks available 🤔

13:52:26
<transcript>: I just copied it. What do you mean.

13:52:30
<transcript>: Okay, let's yank it. Let's do this the actual good way.

13:52:37
<transcript>: I don't know why I thought the other way was better than that.

13:52:41
<transcript>: Now we can do okay. There we go.

13:52:50
sockthedev: new gpt plugin for neovim, but dang the api access is waitinglist for gpt-4. also needs range selection support. excited for this "native" integration though

13:52:52
<transcript>: Silver Light? Yeah, everybody remember Silver Light. You did a ton of silver light. Sirenst, welcome to Chat throwback.

13:53:02
sockthedev: https://github.com/james1236/backseat.nvim

13:53:07
<transcript>: Sock remembers silverlight. This is awesome. One in 10,000 is pretty good odds. It really is for a macbook. I mean for like getting a $3,000 macbooks. It's not bad. Just cost you a thousand points and the points don't cost anything. Just time. I don't know any of those.

13:53:11
zekodun: oh is that any better than: https://github.com/terror/chatgpt.nvim???

13:53:14
sirterenced: Sir Terence D

13:53:16
<transcript>: So who else did silverlight remember? Netflix used to be powered by that. Did it really? I didn't know Netflix was peanut butter. Cabbage. What.

13:53:16
<transcript>: several

13:53:20
<transcript>: Several it was so annoying when trying to watch Netflix on linux. That's so funny.

13:53:28
<transcript>: Let's see, what else is everyone saying? I struck an error with silverlight. We got some silverlight. Devs. Oh, my goodness.

13:53:35
<transcript>: I just remembered I had a blog, one of my mini blogs where I had, like one post or two.

13:53:40
<transcript>: I had a Silver Light blog called Silver Light, muffins.

13:53:40
<transcript>: i don't know why

13:53:41
<transcript>: I don't know why.

13:53:41
<transcript>: i think like

13:53:45
<transcript>: I think like a muffin was like a little nugget. But I wrote like two of them.

13:53:45
<transcript>: so like y

13:53:47
sockthedev: @Zekodun it looks better for operating on the current buffer

13:53:48
<transcript>: So like yarichar. Thank you so much for that follow.

13:53:48
<transcript>: i don't know why

13:53:49
sirterenced: The variable bit rate for video was good

13:53:52
sockthedev: and has inline suggestions etc

13:53:55
<transcript>: I don't know why I just said that out loud, because I feel like dax is going to use that against me. I'm going to get made fun of now for my old Silver Light muffins blog.

13:53:58
thdxr: dude WHAT

13:54:02
thdxr: silver light muffins

13:54:04
thdxr: HAHAHAHA

13:54:11
<transcript>: Used to have Grey Hat fun with that. Oh, I bet my first language was in my rc. I was building plugins to spam channels using proxies. Wow, Ben Adjmin old school. Welcome to Chat natty Man. What are the current preferred Web frameworks available.

13:54:11
<transcript>: there are

13:54:13
<transcript>: There are a bunch of them.

13:54:13
<transcript>: i don't know

13:54:16
glamshatterskull: hahaha i also wrote mirc scripts

13:54:20
<transcript>: I don't know that I could say I mean the real popular ones. I guess next. Js. Laravel, rails.

13:54:20
<transcript>: ast

13:54:22
<transcript>: Astro. I love, I'm using it.

13:54:27
<transcript>: This code base is a huge elixir Phoenix app.

13:54:27
<transcript>: new

13:54:29
glamshatterskull: and made solitaire on my TI-85 LUL

13:54:30
sockthedev: i miss the mirc days

13:54:38
greatgrievance: FeathersJS + SolidJS for me these days

13:54:40
<transcript>: New gpt plugin for neo vim, but dang, the api access is waiting list for gb four. Yeah, I want the api access so bad I'll probably build like an AI startup as soon as I get it. And I'll be one of those people also needs range selections for it. Excited for this native integration though.

13:54:44
<transcript>: What's backseat? Nvim? What was that.

13:54:46
zekodun: @sockthedev guess I got to try that out on the dev stream later today then

13:54:49
<transcript>: And then Zikodun says, oh, that is that any better than Chad gbt.

13:54:49
<transcript>: and them i

13:54:52
<transcript>: And them. I didn't know. These were things.

13:54:52
<transcript>: sir

13:54:58
<transcript>: Sir terence. That makes more sense. My wife brought me a delicious looking smoothie. Look at this.

13:55:02
<transcript>: Look at this. You see the color of this thing.

13:55:06
<transcript>: Isn't that amazing? Looking? It just looks like spring.

13:55:07
glamshatterskull: i love tabnine

13:55:08
glamshatterskull: LUL

binajmen: When I saw 1000 bots spamming crazy shit, I knew this is what I will do for the rest of my life. So much poweeer :D

13:55:10
<transcript>: My wife's the best.

13:55:11
<transcript>: Okay.

13:55:11
<transcript>: looks better

13:55:16
sockthedev: if you have access to gpt-4 via api would be rad

13:55:17
<transcript>: Looks better for operating on the current buffer variable bitrate for video was good.

13:55:17
<transcript>: and has

13:55:25
<transcript>: And has inline suggestions. Dude, what silverlight muffins? Oh no, DAX is laughing. This is not good for me. I should be watching Twitter right now.

13:55:31
<transcript>: You made Solitaire on your ti 85. I did some cool stuff on T eight.

13:55:32
<transcript>: eighty five

13:55:32
<transcript>: eighty five s

13:55:32
binajmen: True, basic on TI was huge eye opener too for me

13:55:34
<transcript>: 85s. That was fun.

13:55:40
<transcript>: Feather JS plus solid jazz for me these days OOH I've not heard of feathers JS.

13:55:43
<transcript>: Okay.

13:55:43
<transcript>: when i saw

13:55:49
<transcript>: When I saw 1000 bots swimming crazy shit. I knew this is what I will do for the rest of my life. So much better.

13:55:58
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't have access yet. Sock. I won. It okay, let's see what they wrote. What did they write.

13:56:02
<transcript>: Process rows. Get entities. Rows.

13:56:07
greatgrievance: FeathersJS is pretty amazing. I've been using it for ~6 years nows and its only gotten better

13:56:11
<transcript>: Process. Rows. What is that doing? Did it just rewrite my functions? It just rewrote them.

13:56:14
<transcript>: Did it not understand the instructions.

13:56:22
<transcript>: Oh, no, it's understood. Replaces rows in place with a subset of the rows. You can modify the existing. I don't want to modify the existing one. Okay, whatever.

13:56:25
<transcript>: Process, rows.

13:56:30
<transcript>: What did it do.

13:56:35
<transcript>: How is that replacing the rows in place.

13:56:36
kampouse: instruction unclear rewrite everything

13:56:37
<transcript>: Whatever.

13:56:43
<transcript>: Instruction? Unclear. Rewrite. Everything.

13:56:46
<transcript>: So here's what I need to do.

13:56:51
<transcript>: Limit rows needs to actually change the answer.

13:56:51
<transcript>: wait

13:56:52
<transcript>: Wait.

13:56:52
<transcript>: an elixir

13:56:58
<transcript>: An elixir. It's not like immutable or something, is it? Can I change the map.

13:57:01
greatgrievance: it is

13:57:05
<transcript>: Like answer is just this big map thing, right? Whatever these are called.

13:57:06
greatgrievance: you just return a new map

13:57:16
<transcript>: This is a part of it. It's like a big json. Blob. And I want to return a new map. Okay, it is immutable. So I just have to return a new map. So limit rows is really.

13:57:16
<transcript>: like

13:57:20
<transcript>: Like, yeah, it's going to just return a new answer.

13:57:20
<transcript>: lim

13:57:23
<transcript>: Limit grid rows and.

13:57:25
<transcript>: Return a new answer.

13:57:25
<transcript>: okay

13:57:28
<transcript>: Okay. That's fine. I'm.

13:57:34
<transcript>: Want this to change what's stored in the database. Okay, cool.

13:57:42
<transcript>: Feather js. Is pretty amazing. I've been using it for six years now. It's only gotten better. Okay. Feathers js. Interesting.

13:57:45
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow lame.

13:57:45
<transcript>: and time

13:57:47
<transcript>: And time two. Dd.

13:57:47
<transcript>: and zel

13:57:56
<transcript>: And Zelamus, zelens and marf and Yarichart, how many people followed me all at one time? And I didn't notice. Did I notice those.

13:57:59
<transcript>: I feel like I didn't notice those.

13:58:02
<transcript>: Herkey thank you for the follow.

13:58:07
<transcript>: A lot of follows today. I mean, I appreciate it. I really do. Is it the Elixir? Do you guys like elixir.

13:58:12
<transcript>: Limit rows. Variable count is unused. Okay.

13:58:16
<transcript>: So I need to get the rows and then return.

13:58:16
<transcript>: a new map

13:58:22
laame: Nah, just your presence :D

13:58:23
<transcript>: A new map that looks like this. Where rows is the new rows? This isn't going to be too hard. Actually, I don't think this is going to be too hard.

13:58:27
natyman48: I have been working on a portal uses Java at backend and want to focus on new framework any suggestions?

13:58:28
kampouse: if it would be java you would get no follow/subs

13:58:32
<transcript>: What is Count doing here? Oh, that's another variable. Yeah. Okay. So if I just yank that and come down here.

13:58:32
<transcript>: i'm just going to

13:58:36
<transcript>: I'm just going to paste it and comment it out so I can see it.

13:58:42
<transcript>: So this is the shape of my thing. And we're going to say.

13:58:47
<transcript>: The clamped rows. Clamped equals.

13:58:49
<transcript>: What was it.

13:58:49
<transcript>: git

13:58:51
<transcript>: Git.

13:58:51
<transcript>: git

13:58:54
<transcript>: Git rows get entity rows.

13:58:54
<transcript>: answer

13:58:56
<transcript>: Answer and.

13:59:02
<transcript>: Count. Okay, so this is the number of rows that I actually want.

13:59:04
<transcript>: Okay.

13:59:04
<transcript>: just my

13:59:06
binajmen: @sockthedev I've got a friend who wrote a TCP wrapper around ChatGPT and works as a functional IRC server :D

13:59:07
binajmen: https://twitter.com/antcatel/status/1643746965921091584

13:59:10
<transcript>: Just my presence. That's why you followed. I appreciate that. That's very kind of you to say that.

13:59:24
<transcript>: I would have been working on a portal, uses java backend and want to focus on new framework. Any suggestions you've been working on a portal that uses java? You want to focus on new framework? What kind of stuff you want to do? Natty man, do you want to do, like front end stuff? Back end stuff.

13:59:24
<transcript>: cli

13:59:25
<transcript>: Cli.

13:59:30
<transcript>: Mobile apps? I don't know. What do you want to do.

13:59:37
<transcript>: If it was java, I would get no files or subs.

13:59:45
<transcript>: We don't use any java for all the languages we use at sap muse there's no java. We have a lot of languages involved.

13:59:47
<transcript>: Java.

13:59:54
<transcript>: You have a friend who wrote a tcp wrapper around Chat gbt and works as a functional irc server. Interesting.

14:00:00
<transcript>: So I.

14:00:00
<transcript>: clamped

14:00:04
<transcript>: Clamped thing. And then we're just going to return a map.

14:00:04
<transcript>: how do i

14:00:07
<transcript>: How do I copy everything from the map.

14:00:07
<transcript>: okay

14:00:12
<transcript>: Okay. I want to copy everything from the map, except for one property.

14:00:13
natyman48: Fullstack bro

14:00:14
<transcript>: Elixir.

14:00:18
<transcript>: Copy, map, change one.

14:00:19
ptrhvns: What languages do you use, and for what purpose for each?

14:00:21
<transcript>: Field.

14:00:25
<transcript>: Yes.

14:00:31
<transcript>: One cannot simply replace anything in everything in elixir.

14:00:40
<transcript>: With some very rare restrictions like process direct dictionary. This is definitely off scope here. Everything in elixir is immutable.

14:00:40
<transcript>: any code

14:00:47
<transcript>: Any code that looks like updating Map simply produces a new map. One might go with special forms for comprehension.

14:00:49
<transcript>: Really.

14:00:49
<transcript>: one might

14:00:51
<transcript>: One might do that.

14:00:53
<transcript>: Okay.

14:01:00
<transcript>: That wasn't helpful.

14:01:00
<transcript>: full sack

14:01:07
<transcript>: Full sack, bro. Oh, you want to do full stack? Okay, natty, man. Full stack. Have you played with.

14:01:09
<transcript>: Sst.

14:01:12
<transcript>: If you want to really be full stack.

14:01:12
<transcript>: like

14:01:13
natyman48: I want to do Website Development

14:01:16
<transcript>: Like the fullest of stacks. Sst.

14:01:16
<transcript>: learn

14:01:25
<transcript>: Learn to build full stack applications serverless applications on aws you can use nextjs or astro. Whatever your favorite front end.

14:01:25
<transcript>: journ

14:01:27
<transcript>: Journey you want to go on is.

14:01:27
<transcript>: but

14:01:33
thdxr: so annoying stop shilling sst adam

14:01:38
<transcript>: But deploy it all with SST, and build out your serverless, apis and background tasks and everything else you need in a modern app. Sst.

14:01:38
<transcript>: so

14:01:38
thdxr: it's so clear they pay you

14:01:40
adamdotdev: !sst

14:01:40
fossabot: SST is the best way to create modern applications on AWS, and Dax (@thdxr) is a co-founder there. https://sst.dev

14:01:45
greatgrievance: if you want to change 1 field, Map.put/3 should work

14:01:45
<transcript>: So annoying. Stop. Shilling. Ssd. No. I will never stop. Dax. Yeah. Dax is a cofounder.

14:01:45
<transcript>: it's so

14:01:47
pbertrand_dev: SST is french for PHP

14:01:50
<transcript>: It's so clear they pay you they do not pay me I just love SST.

14:01:52
zekodun: oohhh.. statsmuse does sports stats. But why no Drone Racing League or Esports?

14:01:55
<transcript>: What language did you use? And for what purpose for each? So that's a very big question, because.

14:01:55
<transcript>: there's

14:02:01
<transcript>: There's so much code at status. Now we've been around for almost a decade, nine years.

14:02:01
<transcript>: so

14:02:02
<transcript>: So there's a lot.

14:02:02
<transcript>: and

14:02:15
<transcript>: And the reasons for each of them is different. I don't think I could answer it here in one setting, but mostly it Stamp used. The idea was when we raised our $10 million a round. It was hire a bunch of really smart people.

14:02:19
kampouse: i watch youtube  sst channel video lol

14:02:27
<transcript>: We did. We hired some really smart people. And we said, what languages do you guys want to build stuff with? What do you get excited about? So we ended up with elixir and F. Sharp and whatever else.

14:02:27
<transcript>: bunch of

14:02:32
<transcript>: Bunch of typescript react. Yeah, it was just.

14:02:32
<transcript>: like

14:02:35
<transcript>: Like engineer led decisions.

14:02:40
<transcript>: Jay Field. Thank you for that. Follow jfield. Peff. J. Fieldpeff.

14:02:49
<transcript>: I want to do website development. Yeah. Sst. Full stack website development. Honesty is the best thing around right now.

14:02:49
<transcript>: if you want to change

14:02:53
<transcript>: If you want to change one field map, put should work. Oh, really, Matt. Put.

14:02:53
<transcript>: yes

14:02:54
<transcript>: Yes.

14:02:54
<transcript>: let's see what

14:02:56
<transcript>: Let's see what that says.

14:02:59
<transcript>: Sst is French for PHP.

14:03:07
<transcript>: Ziko we want to add esports we wanted to but we have not yet.

14:03:10
<transcript>: So elixir update.

14:03:10
<transcript>: one update

14:03:13
<transcript>: One update, map, just update, map.

14:03:17
<transcript>: Updates, Updates the map.

14:03:19
natyman48: SST  I'm not familiar with it, where to start?

14:03:21
<transcript>: Key and map of the given function. So what is this.

14:03:23
<transcript>: App update.

14:03:29

14:03:41
<transcript>: They have some good YouTube stuff. Dax is very funny.

14:03:51
<transcript>: What did somebody just tell me? Maps, map put. Great. Thank you. Great. Grievance. You're so helpful.

14:03:53
<transcript>: Map put.

14:03:56
<transcript>: So.

14:03:56
<transcript>: i can take

14:03:59
<transcript>: I can take a map like this and just add a key to it.

14:03:59
<transcript>: if i add one

14:04:02
kampouse: instruction unclear i end up on vercel :(

14:04:03
<transcript>: If I add one that's already there. It just overwrites. It. Perfect.

14:04:05
<transcript>: It's exactly what I want.

14:04:05
<transcript>: map

14:04:07
<transcript>: Map put.

14:04:07
<transcript>: okay

14:04:09
<transcript>: Okay.

14:04:09
<transcript>: so right here

14:04:23
<transcript>: oh i take back all

14:04:25
coolpantstv: @thdxr is there a way to use SST with Vercel?

14:04:26
<transcript>: Oh, I take back all bad things I said about AI oh, what do we do.

14:04:29
<transcript>: Too many too many of them.

14:04:29
<transcript>: look at

14:04:31
<transcript>: Look at that.

14:04:31
<transcript>: it's

14:04:33
<transcript>: It's beautiful.

14:04:37
<transcript>: What's wrong, though Invalid use of something.

14:04:43
<transcript>: What represents the value be ignored. Where's the underscore. There's no underscore here.

14:04:43
natyman48: Can you share some links

14:04:45
<transcript>: You are wrong.

14:04:45
<transcript>: sir

14:04:47
<transcript>: Sir.

14:04:49
<transcript>: What.

14:04:49
sirterenced: sst just is Vercel with more steps ;p

14:04:52
<transcript>: Where's the underscore. There's an underscore here.

14:04:53
xeqi: line 141

14:04:56
<transcript>: Instruction unclear. I end up.

14:04:59
<transcript>: On that's funny.

14:04:59
<transcript>: i'll keep an eye

14:05:15
<transcript>: I'll keep an eye out for the esport update. Then we hired somebody Zeco a long time ago to do, like, a dota and League of Legends database. And they're supposed to be building a database. And it turned out they were just playing dota and Legal Legends all day because they were obsessed, which I get it. I've been obsessed with games in my day.

14:05:15
glamshatterskull: LUL 󠀀

14:05:18
caaamel: hello!

14:05:19
<transcript>: But yeah. Didn't work out. Had to fire them. It was a rough deal.

14:05:19
<transcript>: it was like

14:05:20
glamshatterskull: i love dota

14:05:25
<transcript>: It was like, so cool. When we launched Esports. What's his name's? Working on the database. And then a few months later.

14:05:26
jokestera_e: afther | there are underscores

14:05:38
<transcript>: It's like, How's the database going? Oh, it's not going okay. Startups require that people have a lot of self motivation because you don't do a lot of managing. There's not a lot of time to sit over somebody's shoulder. And in retrospect, he's very young.

14:05:38
<transcript>: guy

14:05:40
<transcript>: Guy very into esports.

14:05:40
<transcript>: and

14:05:47
<transcript>: And was getting paid to just play Esports all day. So, I mean, it's our mistake. It was our bad.

14:05:47
<transcript>: line

14:05:47
greatgrievance: oh, we should talk sometime. I'm the technical co-founder for an esports software company.

14:05:51
<transcript>: Line 141 thank you so much. 141.

14:05:54
pbertrand_dev: the guy was building the database, manually creating all the games

14:05:56
<transcript>: There's an underscore at the end of this. Why is that? Why is there an underscore there.

14:05:59
<transcript>: Is that a mistake by copilot or.

14:06:01
pbertrand_dev: by actually playing them

14:06:02
<transcript>: Something I don't understand. Hello.

14:06:02
<transcript>: camel

14:06:04
<transcript>: Camel.

14:06:11
<transcript>: You love Dota.

14:06:14
<transcript>: So did this person.

14:06:17
kampouse: how dare blaming copilot :(

14:06:18
daglee: I know people that spends all day talking about dota2 and LoL statistics rather than playing the game.

14:06:18
<transcript>: After there are underscore, so they're not supposed to be an underscore here.

14:06:18
<transcript>: i

14:06:22
<transcript>: I feel like Why did copilot put that in there.

14:06:25
<transcript>: Why did Why did it do that.

14:06:32
<transcript>: Is this valid syntax? What is this.

14:06:34
jokestera_e: idk try removing see what happens

14:06:36
<transcript>: I feel like.

14:06:36
glamshatterskull: LUL oh i am a spectator... i suck at it LUL

14:06:38
<transcript>: Why did copilot do that.

14:06:49
<transcript>: We should talk sometime. I'm the technical co founder for an Esports software company. Are you serious? Great. Grievance, what is the company? Do you mind telling.

14:06:55
<transcript>: Bertrand, That's pretty.

14:06:55
<transcript>: kind interpret

14:06:56
greatgrievance: https://coachify.gg

14:06:58
<transcript>: Kind interpretation of what he was doing.

14:07:06
<transcript>: How dare blame copilot. I know people that spends all day talking about dota two and legal legend statistics rather than playing the game.

14:07:06
<transcript>: i think

14:07:11
<transcript>: I think it would do Well, I think we had stat muse for Esports. I think it would have traffic.

14:07:11
monsef_ot: I am stuck with that ORM migration, I hate those parts when you need to so specific thing that the tech doesn't offer

14:07:13
<transcript>: Try our moving see what happens.

14:07:14
parsnip_lover: Hey is that tmux at the top?

14:07:19
greatgrievance: don't mind at all. Just didn't want to advertise

14:07:22
<transcript>: Glam is just a spectator coachify. Okay, great. Grievance. Very cool. I'm going to put this in my browser, so don't forget.

14:07:31
<transcript>: I'll put that right there. So don't forget. Let's see. I'm stuck with the orm migration. I hate those parts when you need to be so specific.

14:07:31
<transcript>: or

14:07:48
parsnip_lover: I'm leaving

14:07:51
<transcript>: Or saying that the tech doesn't offer welcome to Chat parsnip lover. Is that tmux at the top? Yes, it is also part snip lever. I must say, I'm not a big fan of parsnips. I really don't like them. The taste just it creeps me out. I don't know. And I'm a big veggie lover, but parsnips, don't do it for me. Don't mind at all. Just didn't want to advertise. Oh, no, you're good.

14:07:55
jokestera_e: ouch

14:07:57
<transcript>: You're leaving? Don't leave, parsnip. We can work it out. I know we can. We can settle our differences.

14:08:03
<transcript>: Someone tell me if this is valid syntax.

14:08:03
<transcript>: let's see

14:08:05
<transcript>: Let's see. Elixir.

14:08:06
parsnip_lover: Have you had roast parsnips before?

14:08:07
<transcript>: Elixir.

14:08:09
<transcript>: elixirmap

14:08:14
<transcript>: Elixirmap put nested property. Something.

14:08:14
<transcript>: thank you so much for

14:08:14
pbertrand_dev: vegetable tier list?

14:08:16
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the follow.

14:08:22
<transcript>: Spur crew, chimera, sprucer, vegetable tier list. Now we're talking.

14:08:22
<transcript>: have you

14:08:29
<transcript>: Have you had roast parsons before? Maybe I haven't. Maybe I've never had them. Rosetted. It's possible that I would enjoy them.

14:08:29
<transcript>: i don't remember

14:08:32
jokestera_e: why not remove the _ and what errors you get?

14:08:34
<transcript>: I don't remember what I've had parsnips in. I love most weird vegetables.

14:08:36
<transcript>: Like big fan of artichokes.

14:08:39
natyman48: Tell me more about sst

14:08:55
<transcript>: And eggplants and everything. All of the weird ones. I really am. But for some reason, parsnips the taste of parsnips is always just kind of gotten on me. Why not remove the underscore? I'm just afraid that it's there for a reason. I don't know. Why would they put this here if it were for nothing? Let's do this.

14:08:55
<transcript>: is there anywhere else

14:08:59
<transcript>: Is there anywhere else in the code base where we use this type of syntax.

14:09:02
<transcript>: Don't believe this.

14:09:02
<transcript>: is not using

14:09:04
<transcript>: Is not using that syntax.

14:09:04
<transcript>: no

14:09:05
<transcript>: No.

14:09:08
kaznia: Looks at the docs for lists, it has to do with list heads/tails

14:09:09
<transcript>: That's weird.

14:09:09
<transcript>: why is it saying a

14:09:13
<transcript>: Why is it saying a stuff is using the syntax? It's not using it.

14:09:21
papaowl_75: copilot alucinated

14:09:23
<transcript>: Look at the docs for List. It has to do with list. Head. Tails.

14:09:24
jokestera_e: copilot can make mistakes

14:09:26
<transcript>: Okay.

14:09:32
<transcript>: I thought it was like carrying over the rest of properties or something like if we put for the detail here.

14:09:35
<transcript>: I don't want to remove.

14:09:38
<transcript>: Oh, wait a minute. Because it's in.

14:09:38
<transcript>: an array

14:09:41
greatgrievance: is it saying there's no tail? you dont need that

14:09:41
<transcript>: An array. The first object.

14:09:43
<transcript>: Oh.

14:09:43
<transcript>: look at this

14:09:47
<transcript>: Look at this again. It goes. Visual detail.

14:09:51
<transcript>: Grids.

14:09:54
<transcript>: Wait a minute.

14:10:04
<transcript>: Visual detail. And then it's an array. And the first one has grids in it. This is bad. I need to do it for everything that has grids in it.

14:10:10
<transcript>: Is it saying there's no tail? You don't need that.

14:10:17
<transcript>: Copilot definitely can make mistakes. But I feel like here's my intuition.

14:10:17
<transcript>: my int

14:10:21
<transcript>: My intuition is if I remove that and I remove this.

14:10:27
<transcript>: Then what am I doing here? I'm putting in the answer a new visual, which is.

14:10:30
<transcript>: The Original visual.

14:10:30
<transcript>: right

14:10:31
<transcript>: Right here.

14:10:37
<transcript>: But I'm putting into it a new detail, which is an array.

14:10:37
<transcript>: that

14:10:42
<transcript>: That has this one item in it, but that's not the only item I need in there.

14:10:42
<transcript>: and also

14:10:46
<transcript>: And also grids has more than just a rows key.

14:10:53
<transcript>: Wait a minute. That's not even array. Wait. Yeah, grids is an array. But this thing right here.

14:10:53
<transcript>: rows

14:11:00
<transcript>: Rows with clamps. There should be more properties on it. And I'm not carrying those forward anywhere. So I know I'm missing some stuff here.

14:11:04
<transcript>: Positive natty men tell me more about SSC.

14:11:09
<transcript>: It's really good for building full stack Web applications. If you're building a startup.

14:11:09
<transcript>: like you're building

14:11:19
<transcript>: Like you're building a startup and it's going to be funded. Ssd. That's the way to go if you're going to be working on something for a couple of years or something and you have big aspirations for it.

14:11:19
<transcript>: you're going to want to

14:11:26
<transcript>: You're going to want to use ssd if you're just building like a thing, a side project for funsies. Maybe just build like an xjs app and put it on for sell.

14:11:26
<transcript>: that's my recommend

14:11:28
<transcript>: That's my recommendation.

14:11:28
<transcript>: map

14:11:33
natyman48: Sorry for nagging but didn't get where to start information 😅

14:11:33
<transcript>: Map get okay new bar map. So it's saying.

14:11:36
<transcript>: I should, but how do I carry forward an array.

14:11:40
<transcript>: Elixir.

14:11:42
aj_stuyvenberg: I mostly just build shitposts.

14:11:44
<transcript>: Modify one map in array.

14:11:54
natyman48: My connection is week 😆 🤣 😂

14:11:56
<transcript>: Sorry for nagging, but didn't get where to start. Oh, no, you're good nanny, man. You're good. Like if you're just building Web apps for learning.

14:11:59
<transcript>: It depends on what your goals are in life.

14:11:59
<transcript>: in your career

14:12:14
<transcript>: In your career if your goals are to build like a startup and take it to the moon. Ssd is worth the time to learn how to build robust applications on aws if your goal is to be an indie hacker and just put out crap apps all the time.

14:12:14
<transcript>: then just learn

14:12:20
<transcript>: Then just learn next. Yes. And put them on versaille. That was a little harsh, but if your goal is not.

14:12:20
<transcript>: like

14:12:21
pbertrand_dev: HEY

14:12:28
sockthedev: you just apologised lol

14:12:28
pbertrand_dev: Indiehackers who build crap apps use php

14:12:29
<transcript>: Like a big dream of creating a startup software or a software startup. If that's not your goal, that's okay. You don't have to have that goal.

14:12:34
<transcript>: Bertrand hey, Indie hackers who build crap apps use PHP.

14:12:38
pbertrand_dev: aka me

14:12:39
jokestera_e: you should take your question to chatgpt i feel like its simplicity could give you an answer

14:12:39
ferellon: BibleThump

14:12:43
<transcript>: Aj just builds shit posts that's fair.

14:12:50
<transcript>: Aka me you should take your question to chatty. Do you feel like it's simplicity could give you an answer.

14:12:50
<transcript>: yes

14:12:53
<transcript>: Yes, let me just check real quick.

14:12:57
<transcript>: Update specifically on a list of maps.

14:12:59
natyman48: I am CS major bro

14:13:02
<transcript>: Extremely underrated access and elixir that is way more powerful, especially when it comes to deep updates.

14:13:07
<transcript>: This looks good.

14:13:11
papaowl_75: and if you want to build a startup and actually be able to maintina it, learn Rust

14:13:11
ferellon: I only build crap apps because I can't think of any good ones Kappa

14:13:20
<transcript>: In this particular case, the straightforward map put might seem easier. I'd post the solution with update in using Access. Note that it might be used to modify deeply nested structure on any level. Unlike Map put this people.

14:13:20
<transcript>: this is

14:13:23
<transcript>: This is what I want.

14:13:26
<transcript>: Is it what I want.

14:13:26
<transcript>: oh what are

14:13:28
<transcript>: Oh, what are they saying.

14:13:28
<transcript>: new ball

14:13:31
<transcript>: New ballpreplus enum map.

14:13:36
<transcript>: I think this is pretty cool looking update in and that's the list.

14:13:38
thdxr: I actually made a whole library in elixir to make deep updaes easier

14:13:42
<transcript>: But then this is like some kind of comprehension or something. Access filter, match.

14:13:42
<transcript>: and it's saying

14:13:43
thdxr: callled `Dynamic`

14:13:50
greatgrievance: the recommended solution is my normal approach

14:13:51
<transcript>: And it's saying, just replace, wait, no, actually, I don't know what this is doing. Never mind. I actually don't know. I have no idea what this is doing.

14:13:51
<transcript>: it's

14:13:53
<transcript>: It's trying to find.

14:14:00
<transcript>: Recommended solution is my normal approach. Which one's? The recommended.

14:14:06
greatgrievance: the green check mark

14:14:07
<transcript>: Did you really, dax? Is it a thing I can install? Or do I not need to.

14:14:07
<transcript>: i only

14:14:09
jokestera_e: what ever gets the check mar

14:14:12
<transcript>: I only build crap apps because I can't think of any good ones. That's funny. Okay, a little advice.

14:14:12
<transcript>: while

14:14:18
<transcript>: While someone's getting me the answer to this elixir problem, I just had a thought. I've maybe shared this before.

14:14:18
<transcript>: yeah

14:14:21
<transcript>: Yeah, I definitely have.

14:14:24
thdxr: you can look at it idk if it's what you want

14:14:25
<transcript>: But.

14:14:28
greatgrievance: you use a map function and pattern match on the entries you want to change

14:14:29
<transcript>: If you feel like you don't know what you want to build.

14:14:37
thdxr: https://hexdocs.pm/dynamic/Dynamic.html

14:14:38
<transcript>: Like you would build something if you just felt like you had any ideas? When we chose to build stat muse, we had, like, eight ideas. We wrote them all on a board.

14:14:41
greatgrievance: its like a reduce with an early return

14:14:46
thdxr: look how good docs are in the elixir ecosystem

14:14:58
<transcript>: And stat muse was the one. It was probably last on our list because it seemed like, who would use it? It's just for sports. Who cares? It's not really like it's not adding value or something. I don't know. It was like we were sports fans, and we wanted to build it because it sounded fun. But it didn't sound like a good business.

14:15:11
<transcript>: And in retrospect, it was the best choice. And we ended up building it because we were really passionate about it. And if there's people that are really passionate about it. So like, sports fans are very passionate about sports.

14:15:11
<transcript>: like some

14:15:14
<transcript>: Like some sports fans, it is religion to them.

14:15:23
<transcript>: It completely alters their emotional state based on what their team does that week. Like sports fandom goes deep, right? And it's universal all over the world.

14:15:27
greatgrievance: hex doc is amazing. Those docs come straight from the code and you can actually execute your code doc examples and have doc tests

14:15:31
<transcript>: When you're building a product for people who are really passionate about something and your product makes their experience with that a little better.

14:15:31
<transcript>: they will

14:15:36
<transcript>: They will champion your thing very hard. They will get very excited about your thing.

14:15:36
<transcript>: so

14:15:47
<transcript>: So building things that you're passionate about, like, you're excited to build it because it's a thing you're really passionate about and building things that other people are really passionate about. I think there's something there.

14:15:47
<transcript>: now

14:15:49
greatgrievance: and its a 1st-class tool so almost all elixir code has the same style of documentation

14:16:06
<transcript>: Now not every startup is going to be able to do that. There's some things that are just like we need them for work. You need to build a spreadsheet thing or like a replacement for a spreadsheet. So you're going to build some crud app. And it's like a CRM for plumbers or whatever. Those apps need to exist too. And I get it. Not everything is going to be fun. And like sports and whatever that you're passionate about.

14:16:17
<transcript>: But I think you can get a little extra boost of excitement around your product. If you build for people who are really excited about a thing, does that make sense.

14:16:17
<transcript>: i don't

14:16:22
<transcript>: I don't hear people say that. And I know I've probably said it a few times.

14:16:22
<transcript>: but i do

14:16:23
thdxr: wow somehow the EQ got turned off on my mic, was wondering why it was sounded like garbage lately

14:16:33
<transcript>: But I do feel like that's why Stamp Use made it. We put it on the Internet, and people are so passionate about sports that when they saw it, they yelled about Satmus enough that we got a lot of attention really fast.

14:16:33
<transcript>: okay

14:16:36
<transcript>: Okay looks like reduce with an early return.

14:16:47
<transcript>: The green checkmark. The recommended solution is my normal fresh. Okay, cool. We'll look at that. Whatever gets the check Mark, you can look at it. I don't know if it's what you want.

14:16:47
<transcript>: you use

14:16:52
<transcript>: You use a map function and pattern match on the entries you want to change.

14:17:04
<transcript>: Okay, dax, look at you. Making elixir things. Are they called packages. What are they called? It's like a reduced with an early return. Look how good docs are in the elixir ecosystem. I'm going to click on that.

14:17:12
<transcript>: Thank you for the follows. By the way. Thank you. Kaznia.

14:17:12
<transcript>: and magic

14:17:15
<transcript>: And Magic, Wild turtle, and Captain semantic.

14:17:15
<transcript>: an anonymous

14:17:16
<transcript>: An anonymous.

14:17:16
<transcript>: i want to say anonymous

14:17:20
<transcript>: I want to say anonymous but anonym for the win.

14:17:20
<transcript>: and all

14:17:22
<transcript>: And all's junior.

14:17:22
<transcript>: and parsnip

14:17:30
<transcript>: And parsnip lover we made up. You chose to follow me despite our differences, and I really appreciate that.

14:17:30
thdxr: how much longer are you streaming for?

14:17:40
<transcript>: Hex stock is amazing. Those docs come straight from the code and you can actually execute your code Doc examples and have Doc tests. Wow and.

14:17:40
<transcript>: it's a first

14:17:52
thdxr: yessss

14:17:56
<transcript>: It's a first class tool. So almost all lixer code has the same style of documentation. This is the thing, dax, that you've been harping on, right? That the js ecosystem just needs to be burned to the ground and start over because it's so far behind all these other ecosystems, like the elixir One and all these others.

14:17:57
thdxr: I'm going to do this at some point

14:18:05
thdxr: some kind of package certification for npm

14:18:06
greatgrievance: i have hope for https://bun.sh

14:18:06
glamshatterskull: bandaid on bandaid on bandaid

14:18:08
kaznia: npm needs to be nuked

14:18:11
parsnip_lover: <3 to all neovim lovers. I'm excited to learn tmux some time

14:18:12
<transcript>: While somehow the eq got turned off on my mic was wondering why it would sound like garbage lately. Oh, interesting. How much longer you streaming for? Probably a little bit. Rig berkett. Thank you for the follow rig. Bert. I usually stream till ten my time. Eleven year time. So another 50 minutes. I don't know if I will or not.

14:18:17
<transcript>: I don't know. Do I have any reason to stop streaming earlier? I kind of need to solve some of these problems, and you guys are helpful.

14:18:24
<transcript>: I'm going to do this at some point. Some kind of package certification for npm. Yes. Dax.

14:18:29
<transcript>: Yes, you wouldn't have to burn out of the ground. You just have to make like an opt in.

14:18:29
<transcript>: package

14:18:32
<transcript>: Package certification that people start to respect.

14:18:32
<transcript>: and then everybody

14:18:37
<transcript>: And then everybody has to do it. And then, you know, packages are good when they have that seal on it.

14:18:37
<transcript>: make it

14:18:39
<transcript>: Make it deck. Please, make it.

14:18:39
<transcript>: i have hope

14:18:42
aj_stuyvenberg: dax tested, dax approved.

14:18:47
natyman48: I want to deploy my website on premises

14:18:49
<transcript>: I have hope for bun. Is bun going to do something like that? Bandaid on bandaid on bandaid. That's exactly right. Npm needs to be nuked. Burn it to the ground.

14:18:59
gitpush_gitpaid: when is the next podcast episode and whats otpic

14:19:01
<transcript>: So we can disagree on vegetables as long as we agree on our text editing tools.

14:19:05
greatgrievance: no, bun is trying to solve the runtime issues with JS

14:19:07
<transcript>: Dax has to. Dax approved. Yeah, just call it the dax. The dax Seal of approval.

14:19:07
<transcript>: that'd be cool

14:19:08
greatgrievance: rather than the ecosystem

14:19:12
pbertrand_dev: This is pretty cool. Love the language based search https://www.statmuse.com/mlb/ask/who-yeeted-the-ball-the-furthest-in-a-game-played-on-a-sunday

14:19:19
<transcript>: That'd be cool or make it the th dxr seal of approval. So people have to say it out like that every time I wanted to deploy my websites on premises. Natty man, are you serious? Why on premises.

14:19:27
<transcript>: I can't imagine wanting to deploy anything on purses, but if you really do, then I guess nextjs not going to be a good choice.

14:19:27
<transcript>: maybe

14:19:33
rigbert: That's how I feel about the python dev environment as well

14:19:44
zekodun: @natyman48 why not via ipfs?

14:19:46
<transcript>: Maybe use super snoopadoop. Don't use super snoopa dup. That's a person who just followed me. And I appreciate super stupid dupe. I actually said that I nailed it each time, and that was actually kind of hard super snoop. A dupe. I feel like I could say it five times fast. I'm not going to because that doesn't sound fun for anybody involved. Mostly you guys.

14:19:46
<transcript>: what was

14:19:55
<transcript>: What was I saying? Do you know about yarn? Wait. What? Oh, on premises. Why? Why would you want to play on premises? I'm so curious. If you wanted to then.

14:19:58
supersnoopadoop: Lol

14:19:58
<transcript>: I would use Astro and just deploy.

14:19:58
<transcript>: with the note

14:20:00
<transcript>: With the Note adapter.

14:20:00
ferellon: Sukón seems like a good alternative to npm so far

14:20:03
<transcript>: Did you know about yarn.

14:20:03
<transcript>: when is

14:20:08
<transcript>: When is the next podcast episode? And what's the topic? Oh, git, push. We're gonna record today.

14:20:08
<transcript>: can i

14:20:13
<transcript>: Can I call you Turk? Can I start calling you Turk? Because I know your name is Turk.

14:20:17
natyman48: I want to do all the hard work

14:20:18
gitpush_gitpaid: go ahead

14:20:23
<transcript>: We're gonna record one today? Are we doing dax? Are we gonna do that on your episode? I'm in on your stream. We could just do that right now. Do you want to just go and stream it.

14:20:23
<transcript>: do it

14:20:24
<transcript>: Do it.

14:20:26
thdxr: oh yeah I'm down

14:20:31
gitpush_gitpaid: nooooooo... i have afuneral to go to in a bit

14:20:32
<transcript>: Bun is trying to solve the runtime issues with js rather than the ecosystem. The ecosystem is not good.

14:20:39
<transcript>: This is pretty cool love the language based search oh who yeeted the ball the first.

14:20:42
<transcript>: What did we say when you asked that I got it now.

14:20:42
<transcript>: i got to

14:20:44
<transcript>: I got to know.

14:20:51
<transcript>: Tony Phillips and Bob mercer tied for the most balls in a day on Sundays, with 26 balls.

14:21:03
<transcript>: Who yeeted the ball, the furthest in a game played on a Sunday. So we handled the on a Sunday thing. I think we did not handle yeeted.

14:21:22
<transcript>: Let's see. That's how I feel about the python Dev environment as well. Welcome to Chat Rigbert. At least python tried kind of with the python three thing, but I hate the python two, three split. I just hate how that all went down. I was doing a lot of python back then when that was still a hard thing to navigate.

14:21:22
<transcript>: da da da

14:21:29
<transcript>: Da DA DA DA DA DA, super stupid dude. Welcome to Chat. I said it again? I said it again so well.

14:21:29
<transcript>: sukhan seems

14:21:30
glamshatterskull: the 2.7 3 split is still annoying

14:21:30
kampouse: pip is messier than npm

14:21:35
<transcript>: Sukhan seems like a good alternative to mpm software. I've never heard of this. I want to do all the hard work.

14:21:35
<transcript>: you

14:21:41
<transcript>: You want to do all the hard work, nanny. So you want to get down into the nitty gritty, if you will. Natty man.

14:21:41
<transcript>: the nitty

14:21:43
<transcript>: The nitty man.

14:21:44
ferellon: primeagenHeyy

14:21:45
zekodun: the 2/3 splt in python happened because jython and java guys didn't upgrade to python 3

14:21:50
kampouse: @natyman48 raw js

14:21:53
<transcript>: I should never try puns. Anytime I try to do plays on words or analogies. These are just terrible. I'm just not good at that. But you want to understand it all.

14:21:56
<transcript>: You want to go lower? I want to go a little lower.

14:21:56
<transcript>: now the hard

14:22:01
<transcript>: Now the hardware. I'm getting into some assembly language. Like, how low you want to go? Let's talk about it.

14:22:07
zekodun: and enterprise companies using jython didn't push it forward

14:22:11
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, I'm down. Let's do it. I have funeral to go to in a bit. Oh, no, turk, I'm so sorry. One that you're going to a funeral. And two more importantly, that you're going to miss our episode.

14:22:11
<transcript>: i'm so sorry

14:22:12
<transcript>: I'm so sorry.

14:22:12
<transcript>: i'm sorry that

14:22:18
<transcript>: I'm sorry that wasn't very sensitive of me. I'm really sorry that you have a funeral. That means somebody died. And I.

14:22:18
<transcript>: just don't

14:22:37
gitpush_gitpaid: na its cool lol

14:22:38
<transcript>: Just don't like that for you. I apologize. The 2.73 split is still annoying. Pip is Messier than npm. The two three split in Python happened because jython and Java guys didn't upgrade to Python three. I used to do jathon. I did in College. They made a student. I'd never heard of anyone else doing jaith on. I thought that was funny though. Java and Python.

14:22:38
<transcript>: had a baby and it

14:22:40
<transcript>: Had a baby. And it was jaithon.

14:22:43
<transcript>: Raw js. There you go.

14:22:43
<transcript>: okay

14:22:45
<transcript>: Okay.

14:22:45
<transcript>: so

14:22:49
<transcript>: So we're going to do the podcast now, dax, you want to just go and do it.

14:22:49
<transcript>: it's really bad timing

14:22:54
<transcript>: It's really bad timing. Momentum wise. Did I have momentum? Maybe I didn't.

14:22:54
<transcript>: maybe

14:22:54
gitpush_gitpaid: wtf is jython... sounds like a pilates position

14:22:54
zekodun: @adamdotdev did we say assembly? I love assembly. got a series on the weekend where I'm diving into it for C64, NES, and Unix

14:23:01
kampouse: clojure is the python of the jvm :)

14:23:06
<transcript>: Maybe I didn't. I feel like I was close to solving this, like, row thing. I just didn't really solve anything on this stream. And if I'm going to keep streaming, I got some tight deadlines. I'm going to have to get stuff done.

14:23:07
zekodun: @gitpush_gitpaid python in java

14:23:16
<transcript>: Zeco done. Did we say assembly? I love assembly. Got a series on the Weekend where I'm diving into it for C 64, nes, and Unix.

14:23:16
<transcript>: yeah

14:23:17
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:23:17
<transcript>: i was

14:23:19
<transcript>: I was asking.

14:23:28
<transcript>: Ferrellon popping in. I was asking if natty Man wanted to go lower, like we could keep going.

14:23:28
<transcript>: deeper

14:23:29
<transcript>: Deeper.

14:23:35
<transcript>: Closure is the python of the jvm. I don't know anything about closure.

14:23:38
<transcript>: I don't.

14:23:38
<transcript>: what is

14:23:39
iannery: maybe you should do some pomodoro to get some work done

14:23:40
cowfacedev: anything on java was horrible.

14:23:41
<transcript>: What is Jonathan? Sounds like a pilates position.

14:23:42
parsnip_lover: clojure is cool

14:23:44
<transcript>: It's funny.

14:23:44
<transcript>: maybe

14:23:50
<transcript>: Maybe she's some pomodoro. Well, I think we're going to record our podcast now. Hang on. I got to check something.

14:23:55

<transcript>: Who had questions I had worked with.

14:25:53
<transcript>: rhino

14:26:08
<transcript>: Rhino js, which was the child of js in java and it was horrible. That sounds horrible. Did a lot of custom tcp protocol work for the Project diablo, Two, armory and Marketplace? Whoa. Trust me when I say you don't want to go too low. Did you work for Blizzard.

14:26:08
<transcript>: great

14:26:14
<transcript>: Great grievance. Or was it a third party marketplace.

14:26:14
<transcript>: nat even no

14:26:17
cowfacedev: the 33rd episode for your podcast was something btw LUL

14:26:18
<transcript>: Nat. Even no cloud provider involvement. Roe, that's my goal. So you want to build stuff.

14:26:18

14:26:21
<transcript>: That's independent and free.

14:26:21
<transcript>: of

monsef_ot: could I have the link of the podcast ?

14:26:25
lesabotsy: And that's valid for everyone, appreciate yourself more ;)

14:26:29
<transcript>: I would build natty man probably like Astro.

14:26:35
<transcript>: Sites. It's like modern php, and I would just deploy them on a note server.

14:26:43
cowfacedev: !tomorrow.fm

14:26:48
<transcript>: That's what I would do. It's just my gut. I don't know. You deserve anything good having you stop being so humble. Oh, leslie, you're too kind. Yeah, I don't know. I shouldn't have said that I didn't deserve the follows because nobody really deserves follows. What does that even mean.

14:26:48
<transcript>: but

14:26:48
cowfacedev: !podcast

14:26:49
fossabot: Adam has a podcast with Dax Raad (@thdxr) where they talk about the future of everything: https://tomorrow.fm

greatgrievance: no, https://projectdiablo2.com is a Diablo 2 mod. I worked on it as a hobby until recently. Blizzard was cool with us though. They gave us technical alpha keys for Diablo 2: Resurrected

14:27:08
<transcript>: Haven't listened to it a long time. I need to listen to it. Could I have the link of the podcast tomorrow? Fm.

14:27:08
<transcript>: and that's val

14:27:14

14:27:14
<transcript>: okay

14:27:15
<transcript>: Okay.

14:27:25
<transcript>: Great grievance. No project. Level Two is a diablo Two mod. I worked on it as a hobby. Until recently, blizzard was cool with us, though. It gives technical Alpha keys for dabble Two Rhizrec. That's cool.

14:27:25
<transcript>: okay

14:27:27
<transcript>: Okay.
