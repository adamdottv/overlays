09:00:28
<transcript>: Of me that walks.

09:00:46
<transcript>: No idea about.

<transcript>: the style

<transcript>: The style of their website.

09:01:11

<transcript>: On your website.

09:01:50
<transcript>: if it

09:01:52
<transcript>: If it's not.

09:02:13
<transcript>: Like a word now.

09:03:22

09:06:07
<transcript>: Of the day so I hope that everybody sees that.

09:06:25
<transcript>: We are on your side.

09:08:52
<transcript>: Where we are with this whole thing.

09:09:03
<transcript>: Certainly not as much as the general cyber institution.

09:09:21
<transcript>: Right here. But.

09:09:24
<transcript>: It's kind of like.

09:09:24
<transcript>: two and a half

09:09:26
<transcript>: from a

09:09:26
<transcript>: Two and a half hours.

09:09:26
<transcript>: From a.

09:09:28
<transcript>: Project.

09:09:47
<transcript>: Users correct apps.

09:09:50
<transcript>: Which is something else.

09:09:53
<transcript>: Online.

09:09:57
<transcript>: Requirements.

09:10:32
<transcript>: Explain how to set up a project.

09:10:32
<transcript>: so you can

09:10:36
<transcript>: So you can get straight to that juicy work. And the first runnable.

09:10:42
<transcript>: Is the words.

09:10:51
<transcript>: Of our.

09:10:57
<transcript>: Project.

09:11:05
<transcript>: Even though.

09:11:18
<transcript>: I don't really have that many of them. And I don't need a database.

09:11:27
<transcript>: This is where I wanted it to do something that I want to be able to do easily away. I needed to support.

09:11:32
<transcript>: My landlord.

09:11:39
<transcript>: Download the geographical data.

09:11:48
<transcript>: But I figured I don't want to use that sort of problem making those.

09:12:04
<transcript>: Countries have their own.

09:12:35
<transcript>: Result.

<transcript>: If you enjoyed this episode, make sure to Subscribe.

09:13:38
<transcript>: But when my dance started blowing up.

09:13:44
<transcript>: The life of this channel.

09:13:55
<transcript>: Today we're going to have the.

09:13:57
<transcript>: Tree, Lions.

09:14:32
<transcript>: This episode is coming out after.

09:14:55
<transcript>: That today so that you better understand.

09:15:04
<transcript>: First things first in terms of salary cap management. They did release by rockers and then have Romeo.

09:15:07
<transcript>: Saved them about.

09:15:12
<transcript>: 19 million.

09:15:18
<transcript>: And then using that money in addition to their existing cash base.

09:15:38
<transcript>: Money that I thought.

09:15:48
<transcript>: Surprisingly cj. Gardner John.

09:15:51
<transcript>: Revealed.

09:15:53
<transcript>: Contract.

09:15:59
<transcript>: By the way.

09:16:16
<transcript>: John.

09:16:50
<transcript>: And then finally.

09:17:10
<transcript>: Come together.

09:17:15
<transcript>: They also.

09:17:21
<transcript>: By the way.

09:18:23
<transcript>: The offense line. Obviously everybody knows.

09:18:34
<transcript>: That.

09:18:42
<transcript>: And then flipping over to the defensive side of the Zoom chart.

09:18:44
<transcript>: They made in secondary.

09:18:51
<transcript>: Right now.

09:18:54
<transcript>: They've already upgraded.

09:18:57
<transcript>: Them even before.

09:19:06
<transcript>: They're starting for a trio of Jeffrey.

09:19:30
<transcript>: Walker. And.

09:19:56
<transcript>: Last year.

09:20:47
<transcript>: He's already going to be a free agent. Next.

09:20:53
<transcript>: Slide.

09:38:46
<transcript>: Too many sign projects, and most of them aren't even close to finish.

09:38:58
<transcript>: So today on the softer side of software dev, I actually want to talk about side projects and what you gain from them and why it's important to keep doing them.

09:39:14
<transcript>: So here it is. This is the Commit Strip cartoon I was talking about called West Side Project Story. West Side Story reference. Pretty awesome. But here it is. Let's go through.

09:39:14
<transcript>: there

09:39:20
<transcript>: There we are nearly done just a few more hours, and this thing will be up and running.

09:39:20
<transcript>: wait

09:39:22
<transcript>: Wait. I just had an idea.

09:39:22
<transcript>: now let's try

09:39:26
<transcript>: Now let's try out that new framework just for fun.

09:39:35
<transcript>: Starting another side project, are we? Yeah. Although, actually, I've nearly finished the other one. So I just wanted to test out this other thing.

09:39:55
<transcript>: If you're like me, you're in this comic strip and you don't like it. So let's actually look at this because some people are going to think this is totally a negative perspective that is just pointing out their biggest flaws, and they're going to be really offended by this. But instead, let's look at the subject. Let's look at the start here.

09:40:02
<transcript>: All right? Doing another thing.

09:40:11
<transcript>: And in that graveyard, we actually see some very subtle things.

09:40:15
<transcript>: Some of this building don't even have.

09:40:21
<transcript>: Some of them are using really old.

09:40:32
<transcript>: Trying things out, figuring things out and.

09:40:32
<transcript>: you

09:40:41
<transcript>: You can see a proper, well formed foundation. And he's just trying some other things together. What we're seeing is that once you take all of this experience.

09:40:49
<transcript>: And that's the goal we're not trying to point out.

09:40:49
<transcript>: we're trying to

09:40:51
<transcript>: We're trying to point out what we.

09:40:55
<transcript>: Think.

09:40:55
<transcript>: i'm trying to make

09:41:05
<transcript>: I'm trying to make is that it's not about just what you've done, it's about the journey and what you've learned along the way, because that learning something you can carry with you into the future.

09:41:05
<transcript>: keep that

09:41:10
<transcript>: Keep that in mind don't get responded, keep making side projects and have fun with it.

09:43:23
<transcript>: Before we Advertisement is intended for Jim booty only. It's free. Real estate. We're giving you land. It's free. We're giving you a house. It's real estate.

09:43:35
<transcript>: This is free real estate. We got to bring furniture, but the house is for a new bedroom, no rugs. You unlock the door to your free house. We got you the real estate. It's a two bedroom house. It's free.

09:43:41
<transcript>: Real estate.

09:43:52
<transcript>: Free real estate.

09:53:14
<transcript>: Check, one, two, check, check, check.

09:53:19
<transcript>: One, two, check, check, check, check.

09:54:05
<transcript>: It occurred to me yesterday that.

09:54:09
<transcript>: I don't really like the narratives. I don't like the current narrative.

09:54:09
<transcript>: in the web dev

09:54:11
<transcript>: In the web Dev community.

09:54:11
<transcript>: and

09:54:13
<transcript>: And who's controlling it.

09:54:19
<transcript>: And I had something to say about it. I think I've never known if I have anything to say.

09:54:22
<transcript>: And as I thought about it.

09:54:25
<transcript>: that

09:54:25
<transcript>: I've actually built a startup.

09:54:27
<transcript>: That scaled.

09:54:30
<transcript>: Like web scale.

09:54:42
<transcript>: I have something to offer and I have opinions. This is all new to me. I didn't think I had opinions or anything to offer.

09:54:47
<transcript>: To look out here come my opinions.

09:54:51
<transcript>: It's going to be fun. I'm excited.

09:54:56
<transcript>: First opinion.

09:55:00
<transcript>: Aws is good.

09:55:02
<transcript>: Stop saying it's not.

09:55:02
<transcript>: it's real

09:55:04
<transcript>: It's real good.

09:55:13
<transcript>: All the people that are building wealth in startup land, they're building on aws. They're not building on Versailles.

09:55:18
<transcript>: Too spicy. That might have been too spicy.

09:55:18
<transcript>: we'll start sl

09:55:20
<transcript>: We'll start slower.

09:55:23
<transcript>: Let's calm down a little bit.

09:55:48
<transcript>: It occurred to me yesterday that I'm not a big fan of the Web dev narrative right now, and who's controlling it.

09:55:51
<transcript>: i don't know

09:55:51
<transcript>: And I have opinions.

09:55:54
<transcript>: I don't know how this is all new to me.

09:55:54
<transcript>: i

09:55:56
<transcript>: I didn't think I had opinions.

09:55:59
<transcript>: I can change the narrative.

09:56:03
<transcript>: I'm going to try.

09:56:03
<transcript>: i'm pretty

09:56:04
<transcript>: I'm pretty excited.

09:56:43
<transcript>: Things occurred to me yesterday. Kind of crazy coincidence. One, I realized I don't have any long term goals. Every time I set a goal, they're like short term things that I end up achieving immediately. And then I have no goals. So I need long term goals. Second, I don't really love the narrative right now.

09:56:43
<transcript>: in

09:56:45
<transcript>: In web Dev land.

09:56:48
<transcript>: I think I can change it.

09:56:54
<transcript>: My long term goal. I have opinions. I didn't think I had opinions.

09:56:56
<transcript>: But.

09:56:56
<transcript>: i

09:56:58
<transcript>: I built a startup.

09:56:58
<transcript>: my

09:57:00
<transcript>: My startup.

09:57:00
<transcript>: disney

09:57:03
<transcript>: Disney and Google invested in my startup.

09:57:05
<transcript>: And.

09:57:05
<transcript>: we're at crazy scale

09:57:07
<transcript>: We're at Crazy Scale now.

09:57:10
<transcript>: We're at pretty crazy scale now.

09:57:16
<transcript>: Which more than can be said for most of the people talking on Twitter right now.

09:57:37
<transcript>: Had two realizations yesterday. And they come together to form a lot of excitement.

09:57:39
<transcript>: Now.

09:57:46
<transcript>: Code off.

09:57:50
<transcript>: Wearing a jacket.

09:58:15
<transcript>: I had two life altering realizations yesterday. One, I realized I don't have any long term goals. All of my goals are short term. I make them. And then I end up meeting the goal immediately. And it was all pointless.

09:58:19
<transcript>: So I need some long term goals also.

09:58:19
<transcript>: realized

09:58:25
<transcript>: Realized yesterday. I'm not a fan of the Web Dev narrative right now. And who's setting the narrative.

09:58:29
<transcript>: And I can change that.

09:58:29
<transcript>: i mean

09:58:32
<transcript>: I mean I can have a long term goal.

09:58:36
<transcript>: To be a part of shaping the narrative.

09:58:39
<transcript>: That's really exciting.

09:58:41
<transcript>: I've actually built things.

09:58:46
<transcript>: I never really thought I had a reason to have opinions.

09:58:46
<transcript>: or

09:58:48
<transcript>: Or voice.

09:58:58
<transcript>: Those opinions, I guess. But I've built things. I've built a startup that Disney and Google invested in, and it's at crazy scale. Now.

09:59:02
<transcript>: I have some experience here.

09:59:02
<transcript>: and

09:59:05
<transcript>: And should probably talk about it.

09:59:08
<transcript>: I'm going to start doing that.

09:59:12
<transcript>: Okay I don't know.

09:59:16
<transcript>: This is me talking about doing the thing. I guess I should just do the thing.

09:59:19
<transcript>: First opinion.

09:59:19
<transcript>: aw

09:59:21
<transcript>: Aws is pretty good.

09:59:23
<transcript>: It's not too scary to learn.

09:59:28
<transcript>: A lot of technology out there people will convince you.

09:59:28
<transcript>: it's too hard

09:59:30
<transcript>: It's too hard to learn.

09:59:44
<transcript>: Or you don't need to deal with that. That's difficult. But those same people, they're building startups with those technologies. Aws is one of them. Aws, primitives are one of the biggest advantages you can have as a startup right now.

09:59:54
<transcript>: And to think you need to build on some series a startups abstraction on top of AWS is ridiculous. You don't. You can learn AWS.

10:00:00
<transcript>: The developer experience isn't even that far behind with things like SST.

10:00:05
<transcript>: Okay, that was enough for one take. That was a big one.

10:00:12
<transcript>: But like you're not a baby, we don't need to baby you.

10:05:30
<transcript>: i

10:05:30
<transcript>: I had a major realization yesterday, like life altering. And that realization is I have opinions.

10:05:37
<transcript>: I have opinions and I don't really care for the current narrative in the web Dev Land and who's setting it.

10:05:37
<transcript>: i think

10:05:39
<transcript>: I think I can change it.

10:05:39
<transcript>: i need

10:05:42
<transcript>: I need some long term goals.

10:05:42
<transcript>: and

10:05:49
<transcript>: And this could be one I want to help shape the narrative for the benefit of my fellow engineers.

10:05:49
<transcript>: straeger sty

10:05:51
<transcript>: Straeger. Style.

10:06:17
<transcript>: i have

10:06:17
<transcript>: A major realization yesterday that it's really life altering. And that is that I have opinions.

10:06:23
<transcript>: I have opinions and I'm not a big fan of the current narrative in the web Dev space.

10:06:23
<transcript>: and

10:06:25
<transcript>: And I think I can change it.

10:06:25
<transcript>: i've built

10:06:28
<transcript>: I've built things.

10:06:35
<transcript>: My startup, Disney, and Google invested in it. It's big now, like we do a lot of traffic.

10:06:38
<transcript>: I think I know some things.

10:06:42
<transcript>: I'm going to start talking about it.

10:07:11
<transcript>: Major realization yesterday. And it's kind of crazy that I'm just now realizing this. But that realization is that I have opinions.

10:07:11
<transcript>: i've

10:07:17
<transcript>: I've built things Disney and Google invested in my startup and it's huge now.

10:07:17
<transcript>: why

10:07:30
<transcript>: i don't know why

10:07:30
<transcript>: Why don't I talk about that or my experiences, or how I think the current shape and the narrative of the industry is kind of off, and I don't love it. I should talk about it.

10:07:32
<transcript>: I don't know why this is new to me.

10:07:37
<transcript>: But I have new long term goals. And that's to help shape.

10:08:03
<transcript>: Listen, I've built a startup and Disney and Google invested in it. And now it's huge.

10:08:09
<transcript>: I have opinions and I'm going to start sharing them because I'm not a fan of the current narrative in web Dev.

10:08:14
<transcript>: And I don't know why it didn't occur to me that I actually have some experience.

10:08:17
<transcript>: And authority that I should throw around.

10:08:17
<transcript>: so this

10:08:19
<transcript>: So this is me.

10:08:19
<transcript>: getting

10:08:22
<transcript>: Getting ready to throw some weight around.

10:08:25
<transcript>: Okay.

10:08:43
<transcript>: and disney

10:08:43
<transcript>: Listen, I built a startup.

10:08:46
<transcript>: And Disney and Google invested in it. And now it's huge.

10:08:51
<transcript>: So I think I'm uniquely qualified to actually talk about things.

10:08:51
<transcript>: in the web

10:08:53
<transcript>: In the web Dev space.

10:08:57
<transcript>: I'm not sure everybody does.

10:08:59
<transcript>: There's a lot of people talking.

10:09:02
<transcript>: And not much being said.

10:09:02
<transcript>: that was way too

10:09:03
<transcript>: deep

10:09:03
<transcript>: That was way too.

10:09:08
<transcript>: Deep. No. I just realized, like I have opinions.

10:09:14
<transcript>: And some experience and I should share my opinions more. So I'm going to do that.

10:09:14
<transcript>: it's going to

10:09:17
<transcript>: some feather

10:09:17
<transcript>: It's going to ruffle some feathers.

10:09:20
<transcript>: Some feathers are probably already ruffled.

10:09:38
<transcript>: Something struck me yesterday.

10:09:38
<transcript>: and

10:09:42
<transcript>: And it's really changed my outlook on basically everything.

10:09:47
<transcript>: It hit me that I built a startup.

10:09:47
<transcript>: that

10:09:55
<transcript>: That Disney and Google invested in. And it's now huge. Like we do a ton of traffic. We've made it.

10:09:55
<transcript>: on

10:09:58
<transcript>: On like a consumer scale.

10:10:01
<transcript>: So I think I have.

10:10:01
<transcript>: unique

10:10:04
<transcript>: Unique experiences that are worth sharing.

10:10:04
<transcript>: and

10:10:06
<transcript>: And opinions.

10:10:09
<transcript>: And experience.

10:10:45
<transcript>: Listen, I'm not just a fancy camera and a nice keyboard. I have opinions.

10:10:54
<transcript>: it's made

10:10:54
<transcript>: And I built a startup, and this is going to sound like I'm just trying to puff myself up. I'm really not, but my startup.

10:10:59
<transcript>: It's made it Disney, and Google invested in it five years ago.

10:10:59
<transcript>: and now

10:11:10
<transcript>: And now we're kind of huge. So I know some things about building startups, about building Web products. I know some things. I have opinions. I'm going to start sharing them.

10:11:10
<transcript>: i'm not a huge fan of

10:11:13
<transcript>: I'm not a huge fan of the current narrative in web Dev.

10:11:13
<transcript>: and i think

10:11:15
<transcript>: And I think I have something to offer.

10:11:19
<transcript>: Okay, that's all.

10:15:45
<transcript>: My startup.

10:15:49
<transcript>: Google invested in it.

10:15:57
<transcript>: I'm building with products.

10:16:55
<transcript>: Listen to us. It's a fancy camera.

10:17:14
<transcript>: Invested in it five years ago. And now we're kind of huge.

10:17:17
<transcript>: I know about building startups.

10:18:50
<transcript>: And now we're kind of huge. So I know some things about building startups.

00:11:42
kiwifromearth: i am scared

00:11:44
<transcript>: I started early yesterday. I started 2 hours late today.

00:11:44
<transcript>: a little

00:11:48
<transcript>: A little early. I've been sitting here since 330. I actually woke up really early today.

00:12:02
<transcript>: Working on some sat me stuff, very motivated to get the stamping stuff done, and I realized I should be streaming. So then I had to come up with a thing to record for a little teaser that took some time.

00:12:02
<transcript>: good morning

00:12:07
<transcript>: Good morning, ovara. And Kiwi is here. And Noel, Sheppo is here.

00:12:10
<transcript>: And kasan is here.

00:12:10
<transcript>: obera

00:12:12
<transcript>: Obera already said that.

00:12:12
<transcript>: was the first

00:12:14
<transcript>: Was the first one to say something.

00:12:16
<transcript>: And Jesus, H is here.

00:12:26
developmentrobot: @adamdotdev you're going wild on twitter, I love it :D

00:12:29
<transcript>: And that's it. Okay that's everybody Kiwi created a Twitter account. Oh, I need to know. Please link it. Please link your Twitter account. Get a myspace account too. That's funny.

00:12:34
animouzz: VoHiYo

00:12:37
<transcript>: I'm just going to be like, doing more working, less talking. A little less conversation.

00:12:37
<transcript>: a little

00:12:40
<transcript>: A little more action. You know what I'm saying.

00:12:40
<transcript>: i'm going to start

00:12:45
<transcript>: I'm going to start streaming actual work because I have actual work to do.

00:12:47
kiwifromearth: https://twitter.com/KiwiMinded

00:12:51
<transcript>: I'm going wild on Twitter. Yeah. No, I'm actually going wild in life. My.

00:12:51
<transcript>: key remind oh

00:12:55
<transcript>: Key remind. Oh, thank you so much for the Tweet or for the Twitter.

00:12:57
kiwifromearth: my goal is to have one follower

00:13:00
<transcript>: Just my mind is racing. I'm more motivated.

00:13:04
<transcript>: To get out on the internet and say things.

00:13:04
<transcript>: because

00:13:08
<transcript>: Because. Oh, you have two followers. Now, Kiwi, wait.

00:13:08
<transcript>: would you say my

00:13:12
<transcript>: Would you say My goal is to have one follower. You have one done.

00:13:12
<transcript>: am i your

00:13:16
<transcript>: Am I your first follower? That is so exciting to me.

00:13:21
<transcript>: That's your goal. Well, your goal is met. You're going to need a new goal.

00:13:21
<transcript>: so yeah

00:13:22
<transcript>: So Yeah.

00:13:30
<transcript>: It's occurred to me for a long time, I felt like I started kind of like playing with this idea of just talking more on the internet.

00:13:33
<transcript>: And I started streaming.

00:13:33
<transcript>: i've started

00:13:34
j3sus_h: Let's gooo, we're doing werk today. More commits, less talky.

00:13:41
<transcript>: I've started a YouTube account. I started talking more on Twitter, but I never really felt like I had much to offer in terms of.

00:13:48
<transcript>: The narrative, I guess, is the term the narrative. I don't know. I just felt like.

00:13:48
<transcript>: i don't really have

00:13:59
<transcript>: I don't really have opinions, not strong ones about much of anything, but that kind of is an opinion because most everybody has strong opinions. So if you just kind of have like, eh opinions.

00:13:59
<transcript>: that's a

00:14:02
<transcript>: That's a vibe, and I'm going to start leaning into it.

00:14:08
<transcript>: Yeah. So I'm going to be sharing my opinions. I'm going to ruffle some feathers. Unfortunately.

00:14:14
<transcript>: I don't want a ruffle feathers, but I think there's a lot out there.

00:14:14
<transcript>: that it

00:14:18
<transcript>: That it comes from a good place, but I just don't think it's the best advice.

00:14:18
<transcript>: anna moose

00:14:19

00:14:39
<transcript>: And directed by Rob and oswald thank you for the follows while I was asleep.

00:14:42
<transcript>: Simon.

00:14:47
<transcript>: It is a Sony A Seven S Three animus thank you for the follow too.

00:14:55
j3sus_h: Lens is key, looks like a 1.4 16mm?

00:14:56
<transcript>: Yeah, Sony A Seven S three. That's what the one you're looking at right now is. And that's what this one is.

00:15:01
<transcript>: The production around here. It's a little intense.

00:15:04
<transcript>: The lens on that one.

00:15:06
<transcript>: Is actually.

00:15:12
<transcript>: 35 millimeter. 1.8. It just doesn't focus. Breeze.

00:15:29
<transcript>: So on my A seven S, three S, I try to use lenses that don't have terrible focus breathing on my A seven four S, I can use really nice lenses. So I've got like a 1.435 millimeter on my one of my A seven four S. Yeah, I don't know the camera thing.

00:15:29
<transcript>: i'm

00:15:32
<transcript>: I'm into cameras. I'm into.

00:15:32
<transcript>: production

00:15:33
<transcript>: Production.

00:15:33
<transcript>: but right now

00:15:34
j3sus_h: prime gang

00:15:37
<transcript>: But right now I'm into working. That's what we're doing right here.

00:15:39
<transcript>: Here we go.

00:15:39
<transcript>: so

00:15:41
saltyohm: Good morning!  Hope you’re doing well, friend

00:15:42
<transcript>: So what I'm working on this morning is.

00:15:45
<transcript>: This is sort of like a repository.

00:15:50
<transcript>: This is Vol elixir by the way. This is like a repository where.

00:15:50
<transcript>: we're fetching

00:15:58
<transcript>: We're fetching asks when you ask a question on Satmus called an ask makes sense. Right.

00:15:58
<transcript>: ask

00:15:59
<transcript>: Ask.

00:15:59
<transcript>: good morning

00:16:03
<transcript>: Good Morning, felty. I'm doing well. How are you.

00:16:23
<transcript>: Yeah. So I need to fetch basically one of the things we're doing is we're saying so we have a lot of stat muse users and a lot of them ask a lot of questions every month. It's because they're sports betters and journalists and things like that fantasy players.

00:16:23
<transcript>: they're people

00:16:28
<transcript>: They're people who they're just constantly researching on stat muse for like people who do.

00:16:37
<transcript>: 20 they hit sam's for the first time to do 20 questions, whatever it's free, but people who search 100 or 250 times a month.

00:16:37
<transcript>: we're going to start

00:16:40
<transcript>: We're going to start charging for any query.

00:16:40
<transcript>: after that

00:16:43
<transcript>: After that just like a month, you have to Subscribe.

00:16:43
<transcript>: like ten

00:16:51
caasidev: hey Adam, long time no see. hope you're all right :-)

00:16:51
<transcript>: Like $1020 a month to get unlimited queries or whatever. So basically just trying to like for the people who use status for their job.

00:17:07
<transcript>: Help them or have them help us stay sustainable because we do ads right now and we do pretty well on those, but just don't love the ad model. So if you subscribe, you'll be ad free and you can do as many queries as you want. Cassie, what's going on? Long time to see. I am good. How are you.

00:17:07
<transcript>: i took

00:17:12
<transcript>: I took a break from streaming, and then I came back. I'm back now.

00:17:12
<transcript>: i got

00:17:16
<transcript>: I got Twitch partner. Pretty excited. I'm a partner.

00:17:18
<transcript>: so

00:17:18
<transcript>: Okay.

00:17:23
<transcript>: So one of the things I have to do is when you ask a question like most points in a game.

00:17:27
<transcript>: Now I think it just redirects.

00:17:27
<transcript>: doesn

00:17:33
<transcript>: and i haven't actually

00:17:33
<transcript>: Doesn't compile git queries oh, because I've been doing stuff.

00:17:42
<transcript>: And I haven't actually made it work yet. So this thing is going to be like a way to get the questions that a user is asked in a month. I got to think about this because.

00:17:42
<transcript>: this is

00:17:46
<transcript>: This is kind of expensive to be.

00:17:46
<transcript>: every time someone runs

00:17:48
<transcript>: Every time someone runs a query.

00:17:54
<transcript>: Fetching all their queries from the month. I don't even need the queries. I just need to count.

00:18:00
<transcript>: I just need the count. Can I do, like repo.

00:18:00
<transcript>: count i

00:18:02
<transcript>: Count. I don't know anything about.

00:18:08
<transcript>: Count.

00:18:22
caasidev: I was busy, didn't realise you took a break

00:18:24
<transcript>: How do you do counts in ecto? I'm just looking for account. This is sql. It doesn't count.

00:18:30
caasidev: congrats on Partner!!

00:18:33
<transcript>: and

00:18:33
<transcript>: You were busy. I did. I took, like, three or four months off. I just came back a couple of weeks ago.

00:18:34
aisebaxp: Good day!! Looking busy today

00:18:37
<transcript>: And thank you so much. Okay, this is not a good way to do this.

00:18:40
<transcript>: Let's do.

00:18:44
<transcript>: Count. Good day, seba? What's going on.

00:18:45
<transcript>: We're country.

00:18:45
<transcript>: no

00:18:47
<transcript>: No.

00:18:56
<transcript>: Counts. That's jsx don't want that.

00:18:59
<transcript>: Okay.

00:18:59
<transcript>: that's not

00:19:03
<transcript>: That's not where I want to be. Let's just look it up. Let's just Google it.

00:19:07
<transcript>: Elixir ecto count.

00:19:12
aisebaxp: Not much going on... Procrastinating 10000%

00:19:13
<transcript>: Alt? J feeling good.

00:19:16
<transcript>: What repo aggregate.

00:19:18
animouzz: talking about opinions... sql vs nosql? Go.  Kappa

00:19:19
<transcript>: Length.

00:19:19
<transcript>: i don't want

00:19:23
<transcript>: I don't want to load them in memory. I just want to do a lighter query.

00:19:29
<transcript>: oh

00:19:29
<transcript>: If you want to run the count query in the database instead, you can do repo one.

00:19:31
<transcript>: Oh, just like that.

00:19:33
<transcript>: Okay.

00:19:38
<transcript>: That's kind of an odd way to do it.

00:19:49
<transcript>: But not much going on procrastinating 10,000% procrastinating that is a lot of percent to procrastinate.

00:19:59
<transcript>: Talking about opinions sequel versus nosql go. Okay, so my opinion on sql versus nosql I'm a big dynamodb user.

00:20:09
<transcript>: There are use cases where it doesn't make sense. And here's the thing about most of my opinions you're going to find most of them are going to have some flavor of it depends because it all depends.

00:20:09
<transcript>: but

00:20:12
<transcript>: But I do have opinions. Here's. My opinion.

00:20:12
<transcript>: people don't

00:20:15
<transcript>: People don't understand nosql.

00:20:17
<transcript>: they think

00:20:17
<transcript>: And.

00:20:30
<transcript>: They think I have relational data. I can't use it. Nosql database. They're bad. All data is relational and you can use a Nosql database. And they're really fantastic. Actually. They have excellent runtime characteristics.

00:20:36
<transcript>: Dynamodb, I think is probably the best database for any transactional workload.

00:20:40
<transcript>: They fall over when you need to do certain types of.

00:20:40
<transcript>: like i'm going to

00:20:44
<transcript>: Like I'm going to call them analytical use Cases. So Dynamo.

00:20:52
<transcript>: If you like, and I'm using dynamo as like. It's my preferred nosq database, but the same could be said for mongo cassandra, whatever.

00:21:05
<transcript>: If you have like a use case where you have a big table of data in the ui like your user interface has this big table of all the data and they need to be able to sort and filter on any column across it. That's not a good use case for Dynamo.

00:21:05
<transcript>: every other

00:21:10
<transcript>: Every other use case is pretty great and the performance is predictable.

00:21:30
<transcript>: scale

00:21:30
<transcript>: It basically doesn't allow you to screw up the performance, so it's great. In that way you can mess up the performance of your sql based database. You've got postgres like this database that we're working with here in this elixir app is a postcrest database. It's very easy to screw up performance by adding a new feature by not predicting how the performance will.

00:21:36
<transcript>: Scale with usage with the amount of data in it, there's just a lot of ways you can screw it up.

00:21:42
<transcript>: Dynamodb and other nosql databases. They kind of eliminate a lot of those foot guns. And they make you think ahead of time.

00:21:42
<transcript>: about

00:21:51
<transcript>: okay

00:21:51
<transcript>: About performance and they don't really let you build an unperformant in performant unperformant database. Does that make sense.

00:21:54
<transcript>: Okay. I said a lot of words. You just asked a simple question.

00:21:54
<transcript>: my

00:22:03
<transcript>: My answer is I lean towards nosql databases when I can, when the use case allows it, which is most use cases.

00:22:10
<transcript>: But I'll see the benefits of the tooling and everything that lives in that sql ecosystem.

00:22:12
<transcript>: Planet scale is great.

00:22:18
<transcript>: Yeah. So it depends. But there's some more for you than just it depends. Ginger. Thank you so much for the follow.

00:22:18
<transcript>: i heard

00:22:23
<transcript>: I heard that. I heard your follow. Okay, so it says, I'm going to do this.

00:22:27
<transcript>: Like so.

00:22:37
<transcript>: Instead of repo all it's going to be repo one from P in post. That's not right.

00:22:41
<transcript>: This feels bad.

00:22:43
<transcript>: Asks.

00:22:43
<transcript>: users

00:22:51
<transcript>: Users that feels weird that I'm doing that from P. And ask user select count. You think that's how it works.

00:22:58
<transcript>: Is that right? Okay. So it's not going to be list user asks. It's going to be.

00:23:00
<transcript>: Like.

00:23:02
<transcript>: Get user.

00:23:02
<transcript>: ask

00:23:04
<transcript>: Ask count.

00:23:09
<transcript>: I don't know. I don't love that name either.

00:23:13
<transcript>: Do you have any gits in here? It's all list.

00:23:13
<transcript>: oh get

00:23:17
<transcript>: Oh, get there. We go get recent, cool.

00:23:23
<transcript>: Feels good. I also realized yesterday I streamed yesterday, and I was just very negative. I've got.

00:23:23
<transcript>: to work on

00:23:37
kiwifromearth: get query total?

00:23:43
aisebaxp: Hahahahah...forget about yesterday

00:23:43
<transcript>: but

00:23:43
<transcript>: To work on, like when I have problems with something, I have problems right now with the current narrative and the web Dev community. I need to not focus on the bad what I have problems with. I need to focus on the alternatives. There's a lot of really great alternatives. I think to the things that are being put out there. And I do create some alternatives in terms of just narrative talking points.

00:23:45
<transcript>: But I need to highlight.

00:23:45
<transcript>: the technology

00:23:50
<transcript>: The technology alternatives that I feel like are being misrepresented.

00:23:50
<transcript>: instead of

00:23:52
<transcript>: Instead of focusing on.

00:23:52
<transcript>: i don't like

00:24:05
<transcript>: I don't like what these people are saying. Here's the bad things. I don't like that's. Just amplifying things I don't like. I should talk about the things I do like, you know what I'm saying? Forget about yesterday. I've forgotten about it. Seva get query total.

00:24:07
kiwifromearth: get query count

00:24:12
<transcript>: Get query total. Oh, you're saying for a name get query count. Oh, Yeah.

00:24:12
<transcript>: so

00:24:14
aisebaxp: We love negativity... Not everything is always positive

00:24:16
<transcript>: So we call them asks for better or worse.

00:24:20
<transcript>: The table is named like asks or something.

00:24:29
<transcript>: So instead of query, I might say ask. But I do see what you're saying. This is just like this whole file is like the asks. Repository.

00:24:33
<transcript>: We love negativity. Not everything is always positive.

00:24:35
<transcript>: Unfortunately.

00:24:35
<transcript>: but for my own

00:24:42
kiwifromearth: NotLikeThis

00:24:55
<transcript>: But for my own mental health, I think I need to focus on the positive, because if I just start, it's not so much that I worry about how it's perceived it's, that when I talk about the negative a lot, I just start feeling very negative. It just reminds me of the things that bother me. Kiwi disapproves of our naming, and I'm literally debating because I value Kiwis opinion. So.

00:24:55
<transcript>: much i'm

00:24:57
<transcript>: Much I'm debating renaming.

00:24:57
<transcript>: everything

00:25:00
<transcript>: Everything to query instead of ask.

00:25:00
<transcript>: i'm consider

00:25:02
unodosthree: So u probably get asked this question a thousand times; so why Phoenix?

00:25:07
<transcript>: I'm considering it. My co founder likes to call them prompts now because of things like chat gbt and I get it.

00:25:17
<transcript>: But renaming things is hard because I would have to rename and do migrations and do all kinds of things. But I'm considering it because Kiwi, Kiwi, you have that much sway.

00:25:17
<transcript>: it's because

00:25:17
cowfacedev: well the negativity brings more people due to the drama LUL

00:25:18
kiwifromearth: dont listen to me

00:25:18
<transcript>: It's because.

00:25:24
<transcript>: You talk softly. You carry big opinions. Don't listen to me, okay.

00:25:24
<transcript>: got it

00:25:31
<transcript>: Got it cow face. Well, the negativity brings more people due to the drama. Yeah, I don't know if I want to bring more people in that way.

00:25:40
<transcript>: I'm happy that all of you people are here. Thank you from the bottom of my streamer heart for being here, but I don't know if.

00:25:40
<transcript>: i want to get

00:25:44
<transcript>: I want to get a lot of views because I said something against someone else.

00:25:44
<transcript>: does that make sense

00:25:46
<transcript>: Does that make sense.

00:26:02
<transcript>: for

00:26:02
<transcript>: You know, uno. Welcome to Chat. So you probably get asked this question a thousand times. Why Phoenix? Interesting question, uno? Because we're actually moving away from you. We're actually rewriting this whole app that I'm working on right now. This elixir Phoenix app is being rewritten in Astro.

00:26:08
<transcript>: For a lot of reasons. Mostly. Like, we started this thing six years, seven years ago. Something like that.

00:26:08
<transcript>: we found a

00:26:09
aisebaxp: You need coffee ☕☕ ... Coffee makes life brightful

00:26:18
<transcript>: We found a samus nine years ago, but I think we wrote it first and something else, and then we rewrote it and react. And then we incorporated elixir at some point.

00:26:18
<transcript>: i do

00:26:22
<transcript>: I do need coffee. It makes life bright, full.

00:26:24
kiwifromearth: i have been deep into rust for the last 2 weeks and nothing makes sense to me anymore ive been up for days

00:26:26
<transcript>: So it's been a journey.

00:26:26
<transcript>: and

00:26:28
lesabotsy: What's up y'all, how you doing Adam?

00:26:29
<transcript>: the reason

00:26:29
<transcript>: And we're in the middle of a big rewrite.

00:26:30
kiwifromearth: i'm kiwi*

00:26:36
<transcript>: The reason we chose elixir in the first place was one of our engineers loved elixir and wanted to use it more.

00:26:36
<transcript>: so

00:26:44
<transcript>: So most everything we did at stamus, all the technology choices were engineer led, like we hired people we really loved.

00:26:44
<transcript>: and i still loved

00:26:50
<transcript>: And I still loved to this day, and they chose the technologies they wanted to use to build stuff. That's how we did it.

00:26:53
<transcript>: Les. I'm doing great. How are you.

00:26:53
<transcript>: how's

00:26:54
aisebaxp: Sorry my ignorance... What's elixir used for?

00:26:58
<transcript>: How's lesa? I'm feeling much better today? Much more positive.

00:26:58
unodosthree: I guess the next question so why not Phoenix

00:27:04
<transcript>: What's elixir used for. So it's a functional programming language.

00:27:07
kryotoboi: Cawffee makes me too excited to work. I need all the energy drenched to actually work

00:27:09
<transcript>: it's really

00:27:09
<transcript>: And I guess the next question, why not Phoenix.

00:27:22
<transcript>: It's really nothing against elixir. It's more like it's easier to find people who have javascript typescript experience and I really love what astro is doing. I think this is the perfect use. Case status is.

00:27:22
<transcript>: for

00:27:34
<transcript>: For something like php. Or now astro, which I feel like is just javascript. Php. It's like millions of pages we have. They're all just like served to Google. And we get a lot of traffic from Google.

00:27:54
<transcript>: It's not a very interactive site. So the main reason we're rewriting the whole app is not necessarily like an elixir problem. It's that the app is like half server rendered with elixir in Phoenix and then half a React app. And it just doesn't make sense for what our site is to be any of it client side generated. It just doesn't or rendered. So the React part.

00:27:54
<transcript>: we really

00:28:06
<transcript>: We really need to get rid of it just needs to be like server rendered pages. And when we were going to be rewriting all the React pieces, it just made sense to take a step back and say, do we want to keep maintaining an Elixir app? We don't have a lot of elixir experience.

00:28:19
<transcript>: The engineer who built this is no longer at sap muse. So it was just kind of like we want to be more familiar with the stack. We feel like moving in typescript is just a little more inertia. I don't know if that makes sense.

00:28:31
<transcript>: What's elixir used for so elixir is a functional programming language. It's built on top of erlang. It uses the Erlaying runtime. I think some of the claims to Fame for elixir are.

00:28:32
unodosthree: Gotcha makes perfect sense

00:28:36
<transcript>: What? It's.

00:28:36
<transcript>: like lots and

00:28:38
<transcript>: Like lots and lots of.

00:28:38
<transcript>: threads

00:28:41
lesabotsy: Well enough I guess, pollen allergies are killing me this time of the year

00:28:45
<transcript>: Threads or something. It's like good at concurrent stuff. I don't know. I'm not actually that big into elixir. I don't know. Enough.

00:28:45
<transcript>: but i know

00:28:51
<transcript>: But I know it has some strengths with the way it does processes or something.

00:28:51
<transcript>: i don't know

00:28:54
<transcript>: because

00:28:54
<transcript>: I don't know supposedly really good for web servers.

00:28:59
<transcript>: Because it can handle concurrent web requests or something. I don't know.

00:29:07
<transcript>: Enough. I guess pollen allergies are killing me this time of the year. Yeah, I've got a lot of pollen. I don't know if you can hear. I'm nasally very nasally right now.

00:29:13
<transcript>: i thought you

00:29:13
<transcript>: Oh, you're saying well enough? You're well enough.

00:29:17
<transcript>: I thought you're saying, like, well enough of that. I guess I was like, wait.

00:29:18
kryotoboi: Oh Erlang, the language of networks

00:29:22
<transcript>: What are you? Nothing. I really want to put these on one line, but I don't need to.

00:29:22
<transcript>: but i

00:29:23
aisebaxp: Going to ask chatGPT to explain what's elixir for a 2 years old

00:29:24
<transcript>: But I want to.

00:29:24
<transcript>: i did

00:29:25
aisebaxp: Heheheh

00:29:25
<transcript>: I did.

00:29:42
<transcript>: One thing that's weird is not having prettier. I'm so used to the javascript layscape where I can just do whatever I want in files and then I save it. And oh, that worked. Okay. So there is some kind of auto formatting. I don't think it's prettier. I guess it could be.

00:29:42
<transcript>: yeah

00:29:43
<transcript>: seba please

00:29:43
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:29:49
<transcript>: Seba, please do and let me know. Let me know what Chad gbt says about elixir. Like, what are the pros and cons.

00:29:57
<transcript>: Erlang, the language of networks. Okay, what was I doing? So here this is. Get user ask count.

00:30:00
<transcript>: It's going to be.

00:30:08
<transcript>: The count of asks by a user.

00:30:08
<transcript>: in the

00:30:10
<transcript>: In the current month.

00:30:12
<transcript>: Right.

00:30:14
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:30:16
<transcript>: Okay.

00:30:16
<transcript>: limit

00:30:17
<transcript>: limit

00:30:17
<transcript>: Limit.

00:30:20
<transcript>: Limit shouldn't be five. No, that shouldn't be.

00:30:23
<transcript>: Shouldn't be five.

00:30:27
<transcript>: We're not going to limit it here. We're going to say okay by user with preload.

00:30:27
<transcript>: do

00:30:33
<transcript>: Do I need to preload? I don't think I need to preload the ask because.

00:30:36
<transcript>: We're not doing anything with it.

00:30:36
<transcript>: right

00:30:38
<transcript>: Right. No.

00:30:38
<transcript>: we're not

00:30:39
<transcript>: We're not.

00:30:39
<transcript>: i'm going to just comm

00:30:42
kryotoboi: I often say git in places where I need to say get

00:30:48
<transcript>: I'm going to just comment. It because I'm not completely confident. Yeah, everybody try and win your macbook. It's a thing. It's real. Don't listen to dags. It's not a scam.

00:30:57
<transcript>: I often say get in places where I need to say get oh, cryo what I do is my wife makes fun of me all the time.

00:30:59
<transcript>: I say.

00:30:59
<transcript>: sit

00:31:02
<transcript>: Sit, no, set. Instead of sit.

00:31:12
<transcript>: To like, hey, son, you need to set down. And she says, no, he doesn't. He needs to sit down. Like, what's the difference? Sit, set. Who cares.

00:31:12
<transcript>: i think

00:31:14
cowfacedev: maybe that's why you started the stream early LUL...

00:31:16
<transcript>: I think it's a nozarks thing. She didn't grow up in the Ozarks.

00:31:16
<transcript>: so

00:31:18
<transcript>: So there's some ozarkism.

00:31:18
<transcript>: that's why

00:31:21
<transcript>: That's why you started the stream early.

00:31:26
<transcript>: What did I start it for? Early cafes. I already forgot what I said.

00:31:28
glassofethanol: sometimes I write pubic instead of public and have a little childish giggle

00:31:29
<transcript>: Something else.

00:31:35
<transcript>: Sometimes I write public instead of Wait. Oh, pubic instead of public.

00:31:38
<transcript>: I have a little childish giggle.

00:31:38
<transcript>: some things like that

00:31:41
<transcript>: Some things like that where I say things and then I giggle.

00:31:41
<transcript>: i can't think of

00:31:53
<transcript>: I can't think of anything right now, but I know there are. I don't need to order either. We're just going to make this as simple as possible. We take the users. We filter by the user. I'm sorry. We take the asks. We filter by the user.

00:31:55
cowfacedev: so that dax doesn't say that the mac giveaway is a scam LUL

00:31:57
<transcript>: And then we say where last asked.

00:31:57
<transcript>: at that's

00:32:03
<transcript>: At that's so hard to say. I need to actually look at like an ask schema or something.

00:32:07
<transcript>: What is this.

00:32:17
<transcript>: I need to look at the ask user asks users schema Where can I find that.

00:32:19
<transcript>: That what this is.

00:32:19
<transcript>: might be

00:32:22
<transcript>: Might be it. It's right here. Ask count.

00:32:22
<transcript>: last

00:32:26
<transcript>: Last ask at it's so hard for me to say.

00:32:27
<transcript>: Last ask.

00:32:29
<transcript>: At.

00:32:36
<transcript>: So that dax doesn't say that the Mac give. Oh, yeah, I can get in before dax has a chance. Yeah.

00:32:36
<transcript>: believe

00:32:45
<transcript>: Believe it or not, I get nothing out of you people redeeming that thousand points of channel points. I don't get any royalties off of Adam Bucks.

00:32:48
aisebaxp: Elixir is great for web apps in Astro because of its concurrency, performance, and fault-tolerance. However, it has a learning curve, smaller community, and limited ecosystem compared to other languages.

00:32:52
yanteer: Do you know Munich?

00:32:57
glassofethanol: BibleThump

00:32:58
<transcript>: Just your friendship. That's all I get. Having you guys around. Elixir is great for web apps and astro. Oh, is this what Chad gbg said.

00:33:15
aisebaxp: That's the short explanation... The longer ones makes its very clear

00:33:16
<transcript>: Elixir is great for Web apps and astro because of its concurrency, performance, and fault tolerance. However, it has a learning curve, smaller community, and limited ecosystem compared to other languages. That's all true. But the astro part. What was the astro part? Great for Web apps and astro because of its concurrent. Do you know Munich like the place in Germany.

00:33:18
<transcript>: Judge me.

00:33:23
yanteer: Yes

00:33:28
<transcript>: That's the short explanation. Okay, so I don't understand the Astro part, but otherwise, that sounds exactly right. Concurrency, performance, fault tolerance. Yeah.

00:33:30
lesabotsy: You're a partner now, you get that twitch 💰💰

00:33:33
<transcript>: I know Munich is I mean, I know it's in Germany.

00:33:39
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm a partner. I don't think it changes anything about money.

00:33:44
<transcript>: It's all the same. I think it just means I get this nice little badge.

00:33:44
adamdotdev: see ma badge

00:33:52
<transcript>: Purple. And so it's got a check Mark in it. It's nice.

00:33:52
<transcript>: i like

00:33:53
<transcript>: I like it.

00:33:59
<transcript>: Ask count integer. Okay, so what would ask count be.

00:34:03
<transcript>: Why would that be.

00:34:04
overra_dev: shiny

00:34:08
<transcript>: Ask Count. Why is that, like, incremented. Oh, it is. What.

00:34:11
glassofethanol: why not last_question_count if its hard to say :)

00:34:14
<transcript>: Is this.

00:34:14
yanteer: Munich is The German Silicon Valley i guess

00:34:16
<transcript>: I'm so confused.

00:34:24
<transcript>: So what's happening? Written. Would you like to install language server? Oh, sure, wait a minute. That's just an elixir file.

00:34:25
lesabotsy: You paid $8 /month to twitch to get your badge? Haha

00:34:26
<transcript>: I already have what.

00:34:29
<transcript>: Oh sequel.

00:34:32
<transcript>: Oh, which one do I want.

00:34:32
<transcript>: which one

00:34:33
<transcript>: sql

00:34:33
<transcript>: Which one Do I want.

00:34:38
<transcript>: which one

00:34:38
<transcript>: Sql, ls Language Server, or sql s.

00:34:40
<transcript>: Which one? Anybody.

00:34:43
<transcript>: Do they know which one's better.

00:34:47
aisebaxp: @yanteer for party and beer 🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻

00:34:48
<transcript>: Munich is the German Silicon Valley, I guess. Okay. Interesting.

00:34:51
<transcript>: That's like the tech hub.

00:35:02
yanteer: Yee ahha

00:35:10
<transcript>: Why not? Last question count if it's hard to say, oh, yeah, that would be easier. I don't want to go through and rename there's, like, probably like, a million usages of the word ask in this repository and our database. And I don't think it's worth renaming it all. I considered it because Kiwi Kiwi suggested it.

00:35:12
yanteer: Oktoberfest

00:35:16
yanteer: Is in September

00:35:19
<transcript>: But I probably shouldn't. I'm still stuck on which one of these? I should choose. We're going to choose.

00:35:22
<transcript>: Sql.

00:35:22
<transcript>: ls i don't

00:35:24
<transcript>: Ls I don't know.

00:35:28
<transcript>: Spawn mpm failed.

00:35:28
<transcript>: what

00:35:29
<transcript>: What.

00:35:34
<transcript>: Why would it fail.

00:35:34
<transcript>: maso

00:35:38
<transcript>: Mason install sql LS.

00:35:40
<transcript>: Interesting.

00:35:44
<transcript>: sq

00:35:44
<transcript>: Can't do that. Let's try Mason. Install.

00:35:46
<transcript>: Sql s.

00:35:51
<transcript>: That one worked. This is good. Go.

00:35:51
<transcript>: seven

00:35:53
<transcript>: 07:00 p.m.

00:35:56
animouzz: oktober ... september? x Doubt

00:35:58
tnkhanh: who is Mason?

00:36:03
<transcript>: Okay. Well, I guess now I have sql ls, but I don't have it configured in any of them. That's fine. I don't care. Upset.

00:36:03
<transcript>: asks

00:36:05
<transcript>: Asks users.

00:36:07
<transcript>: ask

00:36:07
<transcript>: Does an increment on.

00:36:08
glassofethanol: @tnkhanh The numbers Mason

00:36:10
<transcript>: Ask count.

00:36:13
<transcript>: On conflict.

00:36:13
<transcript>: that they

00:36:16
<transcript>: That they ask the same question twice.

00:36:16
<transcript>: we just

00:36:21
<transcript>: We just increment the ask count. Is that what happens here.

00:36:23
yanteer: Oktoberfest is actually in September im not kidding hah

00:36:23
<transcript>: Insert Ask ID.

00:36:25
<transcript>: User ID.

00:36:25
<transcript>: okay

00:36:26
<transcript>: Okay.

00:36:29
<transcript>: So I think.

00:36:43
<transcript>: I can just ignore it. I think I don't care if it's going to be 25 unique questions or 100 or whatever we set the limit at. I think that's what I'm going to do.

00:36:43
<transcript>: october

00:36:45
<transcript>: October, September.

00:36:45
<transcript>: what is

00:36:50
<transcript>: What is it? September October for party and beer.

00:36:54
tnkhanh: @glassofethanol  LUL

00:37:00
<transcript>: You paid $8 a month to Twitch to get your badge? No. I did pay Twitter $8 a month. I did do that. But I did not pay Twitch.

00:37:08
bebenzer: hey! it seems sqls is archived https://github.com/lighttiger2505/sqls

00:37:09
<transcript>: October fest is in September. What is it really? Who is Mason? Mason is like an lsp. Installer it installs.

00:37:09
<transcript>: lst

00:37:11
<transcript>: Lsts? For you.

00:37:11
<transcript>: in neo

00:37:16
<transcript>: In neo of him. I guess. I don't know if Mason works for anything else. Normal bim. Maybe.

00:37:28
<transcript>: October fest is actually in September. I'm not kidding. Wow, that's so funny. Why they just want to get it. Is it the end of September? Just want to get it in right at the end. Is that how it works.

00:37:37
<transcript>: Seems sql s is archived. Oh bummer. Well.

00:37:37
<transcript>: it

00:37:41
<transcript>: It doesn't matter. I'm not going to be writing a lot of SQL.

00:37:45
<transcript>: So what I do know now is that let's see.

00:37:45
<transcript>: last asked

00:37:49
<transcript>: Last asked at and then timestamp. So we do have a.

00:37:52
<transcript>: Created ad or an inserted at.

00:37:56
<transcript>: What is it? Inserted app. So we're going to.

00:37:56
<transcript>: use

00:37:57
<transcript>: Use.

00:38:08
<transcript>: Inserted ad or updated at I guess we're going to do inserted app. If you ask a repeat question, it doesn't count towards your quota. How about that.

00:38:14
<transcript>: How about that? Thank you, Bibinzer, for pointing that out. By the way.

00:38:21
<transcript>: Man, I really can't wait. It may sound dumb.

00:38:21
<transcript>: i can't wait to

00:38:35
<transcript>: I can't wait to spend thousands of dollars, just send somebody a laptop. But it's just going to be so exciting after weeks of nobody winning, because it's just a .01% chance. It's going to be so exciting when it happens. Like, so exciting. I need to come over here real quick. And.

00:38:37
<transcript>: I want to look at.

00:38:40
<transcript>: Where is that.

00:38:43
<transcript>: Data.

00:38:49
bebenzer: didnt know you could write functions in sql

00:38:50
<transcript>: Rewards. I put this description in Chance of the macbook and it's not updating the description.

00:38:52
<transcript>: Description.

00:38:58
<transcript>: Bummer, all these transcripts are annoying.

00:39:05
<transcript>: Need to see where we update rewards. Sorry, a little meta stuff here.

00:39:07
<transcript>: Here.

00:39:07
<transcript>: is this

00:39:09
<transcript>: Is this.

00:39:12
<transcript>: Convert to Twitch reward.

00:39:12
<transcript>: set up

00:39:14
<transcript>: Set up rewards.

00:39:15
zharkaa_: unlucky

00:39:19

00:39:31
<transcript>: Create it. Else. We update it.

00:39:34
<transcript>: Why is it not.

00:39:36
animouzz: @bebenzer depends on the sql "flavour" you are using.

00:39:37
yanteer: !help

00:39:37
fossabot: @yanteer Channel commands are available at: https://fossabot.com/adamdotdev/commands

00:39:39
<transcript>: So why is it not getting the description.

00:39:42
<transcript>: We read the.

00:39:42
<transcript>: rewards and

00:39:45
<transcript>: Rewards. And there's a description.

00:39:51
<transcript>: Too long it might be too long.

00:39:55
<transcript>: I'm just going to try and set it. Manual input.

00:39:55
<transcript>: i don't want people

00:39:58
<transcript>: I don't want people to be confused about this thing.

00:40:02
<transcript>: Creator, dashboard.

00:40:05
<transcript>: And where is that.

00:40:07
<transcript>: Channel.

00:40:07
<transcript>: points

00:40:09
<transcript>: Points. Here we go.

00:40:14
<transcript>: Right here, giveaway entry.

00:40:14
<transcript>: no

00:40:17
<transcript>: No chance of the macbook edit.

00:40:17
<transcript>: des

00:40:20
<transcript>: Description oh, it's not too long.

00:40:23
<transcript>: I wonder why that's not being said.

00:40:27
<transcript>: Feel like the code looks like it's right.

00:40:30
<transcript>: That also has been wiped out.

00:40:34
<transcript>: Interesting.

00:40:34
<transcript>: i don't

00:40:38
<transcript>: I don't love it. Let's go ahead and do this.

00:40:38
<transcript>: yank

00:40:40
<transcript>: Yank in there.

00:40:42
<transcript>: Edit.

00:40:48
<transcript>: Okay.

00:40:50
<transcript>: Cool.

00:40:53
<transcript>: Just wanted to make that more clear.

00:41:00
<transcript>: Let's see. Setup. Unlucky.

00:41:00
<transcript>: i didn't

00:41:06
<transcript>: I didn't know you could write functions in sql. Yeah, there's like functions and stored procedures.

00:41:10
<transcript>: And all kinds of things you can do in SQL.

00:41:10
<transcript>: it's a whole

00:41:12
<transcript>: It's a whole deep thing.

00:41:12
<transcript>: redemption

00:41:16
<transcript>: Redemption? Welcome to my chat? Welcome.

00:41:25
<transcript>: Depends on the sequel flavor you're using. Oh, I guess maybe that's true. I didn't know this is postgres, but you're saying.

00:41:32
<transcript>: There's no. Well, I'm sure there's stored procedures in all the major databases. Right. But maybe not functions or triggers or whatever.

00:41:39
<transcript>: I don't know not a big sequel guy.

00:41:39
<transcript>: i don't

00:41:46
<transcript>: I don't write a lot of sequel these days, so we're going to say inserted ad last asked at.

00:41:51
<transcript>: So we use that it may depend on what our indices are set up like.

00:41:55
zxshan: Hey Adam! You've been missed

00:41:59
<transcript>: Depending on our indices, I guess we may or may not want to choose one of these timestampstands.

00:41:59
<transcript>: zx

00:42:02
<transcript>: Zx Shannon, I missed you.

00:42:02
<transcript>: and get

00:42:04
<transcript>: And get suda. Thank you for the follow.

00:42:04
<transcript>: i have

00:42:06
zxshan: Hope you got a well needed break

00:42:07
<transcript>: I have I've missed you all.

00:42:10
<transcript>: I've been away last week.

00:42:16
<transcript>: I was out because my wife went to Florida. She went to the beach for.

00:42:16
<transcript>: like a

00:42:18
<transcript>: Like a volleyball camp.

00:42:26
<transcript>: And played with a bunch of volleyball pros for a week. She had a great time. She's back and refreshed.

00:42:39
<transcript>: I did not tell anyone. I was taking a break last week. Just kind of like disappeared. Sorry about that. But I'm back. Or maybe you're talking about my three month break. Zx shan. I take a lot of breaks.

00:42:45
zxshan: No obligation to tell us

00:42:48
<transcript>: Got to turn on the air in my basement because.

00:42:51
<transcript>: It's been hot.

00:42:51
<transcript>: i mean like

00:42:52
zxshan: Nah just the week :D

00:42:57
<transcript>: I mean, like, unseasonably hot. Not like hot hot. It's been nice just the week. Yeah.

00:42:57
<transcript>: i've seen you

00:43:01
<transcript>: I've seen you since I came back. Back. Right? Dxan.

00:43:08
zxshan: Aye aye

00:43:10
<transcript>: Basement? Thermostat oh, jeez, the Heat's on no wonder.

00:43:16
<transcript>: Actually 1 second.

00:43:20
<transcript>: I need to open up the vent in here.

00:43:20
<transcript>: because

00:43:22
<transcript>: Because it's not actually open.

00:43:33
<transcript>: I'll be right back. I guess I could put it like on the brakes. No, it's going to take like 2 seconds. I'll do this. Hang on. I'll do this. Where is it.

00:43:57
binajmen: I hope the Larabar Foundation is not looking at the stream...

00:44:21
<transcript>: All right.

00:44:23
<transcript>: i'm

00:44:23
<transcript>: I'm back.

00:44:27
<transcript>: I'm back. I hope the lara Bar Foundation is not looking at the stream.

00:44:36
binajmen: ^^'

00:44:45
<transcript>: That's a joke on the rust thing, isn't it? I'm not plugged in super, plugged into the rest community. I mean, I am like in the sense that I follow all these people that are into Rest. So I guess I've heard them talking about it, but I don't know exactly what's going on. It's just like the rust foundation is kind of being not cool.

00:44:51
<transcript>: I guess I need to read into it.

00:44:53
<transcript>: How's been adjmin.

00:44:56
<transcript>: How you doing? Ben? Adjmin.

00:44:59
<transcript>: Okay.

00:45:05
<transcript>: So we're going to go with last I think we're going to go with last ask at oh, I can't say that.

00:45:11
tymekdev: Yeah, Prime has a summary video on all the weird stuff the proposed policy has

00:45:14
<transcript>: Here we go. So not preloading the ask don't need it. We just need to know how many we're just trying to do the lightest query possible.

00:45:17
tom1269_: That just released a bonkers proposal, that’s all

00:45:20
tymekdev: Hi btw :D

00:45:21
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: Rust Foundation went full on corporate, supposedly due to the "5 seats" allocated to prior 'sponsors'...i.e. corps

00:45:22
<transcript>: Timex here. Prime has a summary video on all the weird stuff the proposed policy has. Ooh, I need to watch that. Yeah, I popped into a stream yesterday.

00:45:26
<transcript>: I think he was talking about it, but I didn't stay very long.

00:45:26
<transcript>: that just released

00:45:29
<transcript>: That just released a Bonker's proposal.

00:45:37
<transcript>: Rust foundation went full on corporate, supposedly due to the five seats allocated to prior sponsors. Oh, interesting.

00:45:37
<transcript>: yeah

00:45:41
<transcript>: Yeah. It was like mozilla that started rust. Right.

00:45:44
<transcript>: Who runs the foundation now.

00:45:51
<transcript>: Okay, so ecto query where.

00:45:51
<transcript>: last

00:45:56
<transcript>: Last asset, and then this needs to be I need to come up with the date. Let's see, let's just do this.

00:46:04
<transcript>: I was going to use Google, but like why when I have chat GPT here.

00:46:06
<transcript>: In elixir.

00:46:09
<transcript>: How would I get.

00:46:11
<transcript>: The.

00:46:18
<transcript>: Start of.

00:46:18
<transcript>: the current

00:46:20
<transcript>: The current month.

00:46:20
<transcript>: end date

00:46:25
<transcript>: End date time? Is it date time? In elixir? I think that's right.

00:46:29
<transcript>: Here's. How to do it.

00:46:34
binajmen: I'm going thank you :) So Elixir now?

00:46:38
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: The Foundation itself can be beneficial if they are just...normal. What RF did was over-reaching past the fckin moon

00:46:42
<transcript>: Truncate the day. Oh, that's clever. You just truncate them.

00:46:47
<transcript>: So then start of month is.

00:46:47
<transcript>: okay

00:46:48
<transcript>: Okay.

00:46:50
<transcript>: Interesting.

00:46:55
<transcript>: Cool.

00:47:01
<transcript>: I guess I can test this too, just like they're doing there.

00:47:06
<transcript>: Let's do this let's make a function start of current month.

00:47:10
<transcript>: I want.

00:47:12
<transcript>: If I already have this somewhere.

00:47:15
<transcript>: Let's just do this calendar.

00:47:18
<transcript>: No. Okay.

00:47:21
<transcript>: i'm going to

00:47:21
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:47:24
<transcript>: I'm going to thank you so elixir. Now.

00:47:24
<transcript>: oh

00:47:26
<transcript>: Oh, I'm going. Thank you.

00:47:28
<transcript>: I got you.

00:47:28
<transcript>: so

00:47:30
<transcript>: So. Alexander. Yeah.

00:47:32
<transcript>: So I'm still rewriting.

00:47:32
<transcript>: the

00:47:34
<transcript>: The Satmus Web app.

00:47:34
<transcript>: in

00:47:40
bebenzer: do you have a limit on chatgpt while using gpt4 model? I think I saw you were limited to about 20-30 prompts/(day or few hours)

00:47:40
<transcript>: In astro. But we decided the rewrite. I don't want to be so constrained on time with the rewrite.

00:47:40
<transcript>: it felt like

00:47:43
tom1269_: The foundation change every so often. So the proposal is even if good intentions now is like making a democracy a dictatorship. The next board might be batshit crazy, then you’re screwed

00:47:50
<transcript>: It felt like we're really trying to rush it because we want to get a paywall up on Stapmies.com. And so we're just going to put the paywall in the existing site and we'll just do the work twice.

00:47:50
<transcript>: we'll rewrite

00:47:51
<transcript>: in the

00:47:51
<transcript>: We'll rewrite it again.

00:47:59
andom: Hello HeyGuys

00:48:03
<transcript>: In the astro site. That's what we're currently doing. So I'm working back on the other site for a few weeks, getting some new stuff in there to just buy more time for the rewrite.

00:48:11
<transcript>: a

00:48:11
<transcript>: So the foundation itself can be beneficial if they are just normal.

00:48:18
binajmen: Sounds like a good strategy

00:48:31
<transcript>: A rust foundation did was overreaching past the moon. Interesting. Do you have a limit on Chat gbt while using gpt model? I think. Yeah. It's like 20 to 30. Is that what it was? Something like that? It doesn't say it. Once you've done a query, I think it's like 25 every 3 hours or something. And that changes maybe over time.

00:48:40
<transcript>: The foundation change every so often so the proposals even if good intentions now is like making a democracy a dictatorship. Oof bomber.

00:48:40
<transcript>: bom

00:48:42
<transcript>: Bomber.

00:48:46
<transcript>: And om's. Here.

00:48:46
<transcript>: yeah

00:48:48
<transcript>: Yeah, it's a strategy.

00:49:01
<transcript>: It takes all the pressure off the rewrite being done as quickly as possible because we've wanted to I mean, really like we with stat Music just get so much traffic and there's people who use it.

00:49:01
<transcript>: for

00:49:16
<transcript>: For their job, a lot of sports betters and journalists, things like that. And it's just we're way past time to move out of the ad model. We've only done ads that's been our way to monetize. And there's other little things we've done deals with teams and stuff like that.

00:49:17
<transcript>: But.

00:49:17
<transcript>: we really want to

00:49:19
<transcript>: We really want to.

00:49:28
<transcript>: Monetize the software directly and say, hey, if you benefit from stat muse, help us pay for it, and it's people that can afford to.

00:49:32
<transcript>: So it'll still be free up to a certain number of queries each month, but.

00:49:32
<transcript>: for

00:49:34
extremelyryan: Rust foundation canceled Primeagen's Rust 'N Guns conf

00:49:42
<transcript>: For our power users. Which crazy fact. The numbers at Samuel just blow my mind a little bit because it's grown so much in the last year.

00:49:52
<transcript>: I think the first two or three years, it took us maybe two or three years to hit our first million queries on status. And now we do something like 2 million a day.

00:49:52
<transcript>: and what's crazy

00:49:53
itm0: now its Fe2O3 'd Guns

00:50:12
<transcript>: And what's crazy is you look at the numbers of people who do like over 100 searches a month. It's something like 80,000 people do over 100 searches on sat me's a month. So even if it's big numbers of people that are power user group, if we get that group to convert at any rate at all, it's just going to mean a whole lot for our business.

00:50:15
<transcript>: We'll actually be a lot more sustainable.

00:50:20
<transcript>: Russ Foundation Canceled Prime Engines, rust and Guns conference? Oh, for real.

00:50:20
<transcript>: now it's

00:50:25
tom1269_: LUL LUL

00:50:27
<transcript>: Now it's fe 203, Guns. Welcome to Chat. Itmo. What is fe 203.

00:50:34
<transcript>: Like iron. Is it like rust? Is that like the element? What is that.

00:50:41
extremelyryan: ferris = rust mascot

00:50:41
<transcript>: They canceled prime's rust and Guns conference.

00:50:41
<transcript>: there really

00:50:45
<transcript>: There really was going to be a rust and guns conference.

00:50:46
kiwifromearth: kiwi

00:50:46
tom1269_: Rust IronOxide

00:50:47
<transcript>: Ferris.

00:50:49
<transcript>: So that's like.

00:50:52
<transcript>: Rust iron oxide.

00:50:53
<transcript>: Interesting.

00:50:53
<transcript>: this

00:51:02
vimcerf: Sadge

00:51:02
<transcript>: This is all hilarious. I mean, it's not. It's sad. I saw rust hobbyist on Twitter is no longer on Twitter. Did she leave.

00:51:13
<transcript>: Somebody tweeted like, look, it's already had impact that people in the Russ community have left Twitter. Russ hobbyist was one of my favorite files on Twitter. Did she really leave Twitter? Does anybody know.

00:51:21
<transcript>: Vincerf, don't be sad, okay? Start of current month.

00:51:21
<transcript>: we've got

00:51:27

00:51:42
<transcript>: Ix.

00:51:42
<transcript>: this is awesome

00:51:44
extremelyryan: rust hobbyist account looks deleted

00:51:51
<transcript>: This is awesome. How do I import this thing, though? Mothra asks Star of Current month.

00:51:55
<transcript>: I do way too much smashing of keys.

00:51:58
<transcript>: Undefined.

00:51:58
<transcript>: i think

00:52:00
<transcript>: I think I have to import something. Maybe.

00:52:06
<transcript>: Yeah. Russ hobbyist looks deleted, doesn't it? I hope she comes back.

00:52:08
tymekdev: good thing the keys sound good LUL

00:52:10
<transcript>: That's a bummer. You think it was over the whole rust situation.

00:52:10
<transcript>: nemanj

00:52:13
<transcript>: Nemanja. Thank you so much for the follow. I appreciate that. Follow.

00:52:19
<transcript>: Let's see. Press control. Z. Do I need to import it or something.

00:52:23
<transcript>: Example.

00:52:28
<transcript>: The module is called Mothra asks.

00:52:34
<transcript>: Let's see. Did I make it private or something.

00:52:38
<transcript>: Def start of current month.

00:52:42
<transcript>: Do I not need to put like Parins on this or something.

00:52:50
<transcript>: Part of current month.

00:52:53
<transcript>: Interesting.

00:52:53
<transcript>: maybe we need

00:52:55
<transcript>: Maybe we need to restart.

00:52:55
<transcript>: iex

00:52:57
<transcript>: Iex since I made that change.

00:53:02
<transcript>: Maybe just maybe.

00:53:20
<transcript>: Bomber I don't know how to use iex.

00:53:20
<transcript>: good thing

00:53:28
<transcript>: Good thing the keys sound good. You mean my keys? My keyboard keys. Camels. Here. What's going on? Camel.

00:53:35
tymekdev: aye, you said "mashing keys too much" or smth

00:53:36
<transcript>: Why can't I do this.

00:53:42
<transcript>: Oh, I said mashing keys? Oh, yeah, I got you.

00:53:42
<transcript>: so at least

00:53:48
<transcript>: So at least they sound good. Yeah, I should type more, actually, because my keys do sound good.

00:53:49
zxshan: Mothra module not avail in iex?

00:53:54
<transcript>: Well, what's the problem here? Oh, well, for one thing, dt, that was dumb. Just daytime.

00:53:54
<transcript>: but that

00:53:58
<transcript>: But that shouldn't be the problem unless it couldn't compile. And that was the problem.

00:54:02
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow zamax.

00:54:02
<transcript>: appreciate

00:54:02
ghostyx101: sup hows it going

<transcript>: Appreciate your follow.

00:54:07
<transcript>: I ex. Let's try this again.

00:54:11
<transcript>: ask

00:54:13
<transcript>: Asks.

00:54:15
caaamel: I hope Rust Foundation will change their decision as I'm in the middle of "the book". Vibe around it isn't good

00:54:17
<transcript>: Start.

00:54:17
<transcript>: of current

00:54:19
<transcript>: Of current month.

00:54:21
<transcript>: I have an idea after this.

00:54:23
<transcript>: I have an idea.

00:54:28
<transcript>: My idea is let's look up. I know there's some examples of iex in here.

00:54:33
<transcript>: Keyword.

00:54:38
<transcript>: Extra. So they're calling it like that.

00:54:40
alparkaan: dont you get a compile error or something?

00:54:40
<transcript>: Do this. I.

00:54:43
<transcript>: Keyword.

00:54:45
<transcript>: Extra.

00:54:45
<transcript>: put

00:54:47
<transcript>: Put if.

00:54:48
<transcript>: Two, one.

00:54:52
<transcript>: Bar.

00:54:54
<transcript>: What.

00:54:58
<transcript>: False and.

00:55:03
<transcript>: wonder if i'm

00:55:03
<transcript>: So I'm like not in the right spot or something.

00:55:05
<transcript>: Wonder if I'm not in the right spot.

00:55:08
<transcript>: Maybe I need to be somewhere else.

00:55:13
<transcript>: Like in this Mothra directory. Maybe.

00:55:19
<transcript>: Or in the lib directory. Maybe I need to go into the lib directory.

00:55:19
<transcript>: what's this

00:55:21
<transcript>: What's this.

00:55:25
<transcript>: Alias mothra oh, Can I Just use.

00:55:27
<transcript>: It.

00:55:31
<transcript>: Asks. Maybe. I don't need to.

00:55:38
<transcript>: Don't you get a compile error or something? Yeah, I'm not actually seeing one.

00:55:38
<transcript>: oh there's

00:55:41
<transcript>: Oh, there's a package? Json.

00:55:45
<transcript>: Oh, that's an asset.

00:55:53
<transcript>: Like there might be something in the readme that would help me.

00:55:57
<transcript>: We'll check there next.

00:55:57
<transcript>: yeah why isn't it giving

00:56:02
<transcript>: with the dt

00:56:02
<transcript>: Yeah. Why isn't it giving a compiler? Actually, that's a great question. Why was it not.

00:56:06
<transcript>: With the dt thing because there's no dt alias.

00:56:06
<transcript>: how is it

00:56:07
<transcript>: How is it doing that.

00:56:15
<transcript>: Here's a bunch of iex examples, but why is I ex not working? Do I need to run it differently.

00:56:26
<transcript>: Like I need to run. It different? Oh, here we go, bin. I exm.

00:56:31
<transcript>: Start the Mothra without Phoenix or webpack.

00:56:33
binajmen: I'm a bit disappointed by the recurrent hosting problems I have with Fly.io recently. I'm far away from being a skilled DevOps, so I really like the simplicity of their services. But it becomes annoying. I might use SST but I'm so afraid by the complexity of AWS.. Any words to encourage me? GivePLZ

00:56:36
<transcript>: Shell.

00:56:41
<transcript>: Do I need to be doing this? I think I need to be doing this.

00:56:43
<transcript>: Okay.

00:56:50
<transcript>: So.

00:56:55
<transcript>: Nmos I ex.

00:56:58

<transcript>: Maybe.

00:57:15
<transcript>: Ixm? No.

00:57:18
<transcript>: Bin I exm.

00:57:23
<transcript>: I think this is Loading the stuff.

00:57:26
<transcript>: It failed to compile so that's good.

00:57:35
<transcript>: I think that's good. Enforcer. Yeah. Okay. I actually do have code that doesn't compile. So that's good. Here, though. This code should compile.

00:57:35
<transcript>: go to

00:57:37
<transcript>: Go to enforcer.

00:57:46
<transcript>: There it is. Let's just do.

00:57:49
juniornascm: Good morning everyone

00:57:50
<transcript>: False.

00:57:50
<transcript>: that should

00:57:53

<transcript>: Mathemajo not available in iex compilation error still undefined function LTE oh Yeah.

00:58:13
<transcript>: This is also not going to compile.

00:58:22
<transcript>: This would just get all of their queries if I comment that out. Oh, but that doesn't work either. Undefined function count.

00:58:29
<transcript>: i hope

00:58:29
<transcript>: Oh, that's not how you do repo count. Okay, we'll look that up. It's going well. Ghosty, how are you.

00:58:37
<transcript>: I hope rust foundation will change their decision as I'm in the middle of the book vibe around. It isn't good. I'm sure it'll recover.

00:58:37
<transcript>: if they get this

00:58:44
<transcript>: If they get this month's blowback, I feel like the community will self heal. That's my optimistic take.

00:58:44
<transcript>: that

00:58:45
<transcript>: That.

00:58:51
<transcript>: There's too many good people in that community that are really upset. If that's the case, surely they'll reconsider.

00:58:51
<transcript>: i hope

00:58:53
<transcript>: I hope we'll see.

00:58:55
<transcript>: But.

00:58:55
<transcript>: i wouldn

00:59:00
<transcript>: I wouldn't stop investing in rust. As a developer, I feel like.

00:59:00
<transcript>: it's still

00:59:04
<transcript>: It's still surely safe to go down that path. Right? I hope.

00:59:04
tymekdev: I think, as everything, it is blown out of proportion. It is a proposal open for feedback after all

00:59:17
zxshan: What's the Rust drama? TLDR?

00:59:21
<transcript>: Let's see. I'm a bit disappointed by the recurrent hosting problems I have with Fly io recently. I'm far away from being a skilled devop, so I really like the simplicity of their services, but it becomes annoying. I might use sst, but I'm so afraid of the complexity of AWS any words that encourage me? Ben adjminn. Oh, my word. Do I have words.

00:59:21
<transcript>: this is exactly

00:59:27
<transcript>: This is exactly what's on my mind right now, which is I need to be sharing SST more with the world.

00:59:35
<transcript>: I mean, the sst folks, dax is okay. They're doing a good job. They're doing a good job getting the word out. But they need more outside people.

00:59:39
tymekdev: @zxshan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gutR_LNoZw0

00:59:43
<transcript>: as

00:59:43
<transcript>: And I feel like it's now my mission to spread the good word of sst. Because when people talk about Versailles.

00:59:46
<transcript>: As like this amazing developer experience.

00:59:46
<transcript>: and how

00:59:49
zxshan: Thank you @TymekDev <3

00:59:51
<transcript>: And how it's worth the cost and the runtime issues.

00:59:51
<transcript>: there's not

00:59:54
<transcript>: There's not runtime issues. I mean, it's a great platform.

00:59:54
<transcript>: but

01:00:14
<transcript>: But I think a lot of the stacks that people use in deployer cell there are runtime issues like prisma, but people will gloss over the pricing and all the other issues with the for sale because excellent Dev experience. It's amazing. But really when I stop and think about what is the developer experience everyone's so excited about it's not get push anymore. Everything has git push.

01:00:21
<transcript>: doesn't

01:00:21
<transcript>: It's table Stakes If your technology that you're using the platform you're building on the stack using whatever.

01:00:28
<transcript>: Doesn't have git push and it just automatically deploys. Then that's glaringly bad. So.

01:00:33
bowserbigbeanburrito: moistc8Sip

01:00:35
<transcript>: We can't say versaille has an amazing Dev experience because I can just hook up my GitHub and it works. Everything does that now. So including SSD.

01:00:35
<transcript>: that's just

01:00:55
<transcript>: That's just table stakes. The thing about sst everyone wants to say like the aws dev experience is so bad, and it is if you're like poking around in the console and building apps that way. But aws, the dev experience becomes much better when you use sst, and sst is working on their own console. That'll be a better web app for kind of like.

01:00:55
<transcript>: getting all your

01:01:02
<transcript>: Getting all your monitoring it'll be more like using versaille, but on your own AWS account and I've just tweeted yesterday.

01:01:02
<transcript>: like stan

01:01:05
<transcript>: Like stanis couldn't exist on Versaille.

01:01:05
<transcript>: we would be out of

01:01:09
<transcript>: We would be out of business. We would have ran out of funding a long time ago. Just the cost.

01:01:09
<transcript>: the

01:01:13
<transcript>: The Way Costs Scale on versaille versus AWS.

01:01:13
<transcript>: are just abs

01:01:14
<transcript>: Are just absurd.

01:01:14
<transcript>: they

01:01:16
<transcript>: They have to make money.

01:01:36
<transcript>: But I don't know. People think that. I think people throw out that like, oh, the versailles free tier. So generous. And it's so cheap to have ourselves. It's not cheap to be on for sale. It's cheap as long as nobody uses your thing. Stam use literally could not exist with our usage on versailles, like, money wise. It just wouldn't work economically. We would be dead.

01:01:41
<transcript>: So it's important. I think if you're building a startup, you're raising money and.

01:01:41
<transcript>: you're really committ

01:01:46
<transcript>: You're really committed to something if you're an indie hacker and you just got a lot of side projects, whatever.

01:01:50
<transcript>: Use or sell it's amazing. The free tier is fantastic.

01:01:50
<transcript>: just like

01:01:55
<transcript>: Just like if your thing makes it and it grows and you intend for it to make it.

01:01:55
<transcript>: at some point

01:02:01
levidayne: Per developer pricing, 45c per gb on Vercel. It’s pretty wacky

01:02:02
<transcript>: At some point the costs are going to be an issue. I think learning the skills to build with things like SST.

01:02:02
<transcript>: you're not

01:02:03
cowfacedev: aws is better when you don't touch the dashboard LUL. I have used pulumi for aws and it is a much better dev experience LUL

01:02:09
<transcript>: You're not giving up that much in terms of developer experience, and that gap is closing all the time. And what you're gaining is actual skills.

01:02:09
<transcript>: where

01:02:17
<transcript>: Where you can actually build things that are complicated, that aren't just web requests because the versailles model of the world, the way they.

01:02:17
<transcript>: shape

01:02:30
<transcript>: Shape Web development is like everything in web development boils down to synchronous requests from the browser. And that's just not true. And I know they just added cron jobs, but the fact that they just added cron jobs and.

01:02:30
<transcript>: they're still

01:02:32
<transcript>: They're still really kind of limited and weird.

01:02:48
binajmen: Ok you managed to build the hype inside me.

01:02:53
<transcript>: Just points to the fact that they don't understand that apps get more complicated than just making api requests. Okay, I don't know where that came from. I just got on. This is just a lot in my brain right now, but Ben Adjminn sst is worth it. Dive into it. You'll learn some real skills with aws. It's not scary. I don't know why. As an industry, we feel like we need to coddle people.

01:02:55
<transcript>: And scare them off from using anything.

01:02:55
<transcript>: sure

01:03:06
<transcript>: Sure don't ride assembly. We're far enough along in the evolution of programming that abstraction. Modern programming languages is a good one. Stick with that model.

01:03:06
<transcript>: programming langu

01:03:11
<transcript>: but

01:03:11
<transcript>: Programming language. Don't go down to assembly. You probably don't need to.

01:03:22
<transcript>: But we don't need to scare people and tell them that they're not smart enough to learn. Aws, it's just ridiculous. The user experience of using the console is bad, but that's bad for everybody, whether you have a ton of experience or not.

01:03:22
<transcript>: the user experience

01:03:22
tymekdev: I always had an impression that AWS was really pricey. Don't know where I got that from, though... comparison to self-hosted at a certain point...?

01:03:32
<transcript>: The user experience of using or the developer experience of using sst is fantastic. Okay, I'm done here's. The other thing. I got one more thing. Okay.

01:03:36
<transcript>: I'm like I'm done. And then I wasn't done. Here's the thing.

01:03:36
<transcript>: the thing

01:03:44
<transcript>: The thing about developer experience, people throw the word around a lot. It's the Princess bride. Like you keep using that word. I don't think you know what it means.

01:03:44
<transcript>: you can't just

01:03:49
<transcript>: You can't just say like versaille has a better developer experience than AWS.

01:03:49
<transcript>: it's just not

01:03:59
<transcript>: It's just not true, because it's not a static thing. It depends on what you're building. So I tried to think of an analogy last night, and then I just bailed. But it'd be like.

01:04:01
<transcript>: the develop

01:04:01
<transcript>: Saying.

01:04:07
wesleycoder: Hello, g'day!

01:04:11
<transcript>: The developer experience of a toaster is so much better than a microwave. It's like, yeah, if you're making toast, it is. But if you're making, I don't know.

01:04:11
<transcript>: something that you need to put

01:04:13
<transcript>: Something that you need to put in the microwave.

01:04:13
<transcript>: this is

01:04:31
<transcript>: This is where my analogy skills just break down. I don't know. Like a frozen dinner that doesn't fit in the toaster. Suddenly, that developer experience not so great. Right? Okay, so it depends what you're building. If you're building an actual startup with actual technology.

01:04:31
<transcript>: and you have

01:04:32
<transcript>: And you have.

01:04:32
<transcript>: cues

01:04:35
cowfacedev: and the all the major cloud providers have too many things and hence they are a pain point to work with LUL . may it be gcp/aws/azure

01:04:40
impostorengineer: Steam veggies

01:04:44
<transcript>: Cues to create back pressure and durability. And you have Cron jobs, and you have an api that's more complicated than just synchronous network requests. Like if you have anything of complexity.

01:04:44
<transcript>: the

01:05:02
<transcript>: The developer experience of sst is infinitely better than versaille, because you can't do that stuff on versailles. You literally can't even do it. So when you can write like ten lines of typescript and have like a durable queue that your api is now queuing responses or something doing something more complicated with.

01:05:10
<transcript>: You can't do that. Ever sell and stitching together five different sas apps to accomplish that is a worst developer experience. Okay.

01:05:13
<transcript>: I'm done. I just spit a lot.

01:05:18
<transcript>: I'm going to actually read chat. Now I just realized I'm not even looking at chat.

01:05:18
<transcript>: i've just been scream

01:05:23
<transcript>: I've just been screaming into my teleprompter. How are we doing? How's everybody.

01:05:39
<transcript>: Let's see. I'm going to scroll. Oh, you guys didn't actually talk that much. Thank you for not. I'm not so behind browser. Big bean burrito. Welcome to my chat. What is this, a drum roll? What is he doing? Oh, he's sipping something. He's drinking something.

01:05:42
bowserbigbeanburrito: giggly16Bongo

01:05:44
iannery: morning adam!

01:05:48
<transcript>: There's a YouTube video. Oh, what's the rest drama? I think as everything, it's blown out of proportion is the proposal open for feedback? After all.

01:05:48
<transcript>: yes

01:05:59
<transcript>: Yes. Let's hope. Wait a minute. But what if timec is like a mole planted by the rust foundation to start convincing the community that it's okay. I'm just kidding.

01:05:59
<transcript>: per developer

01:06:03
<transcript>: Per developer pricing Forty five cents per gigabyte of or sell it's pretty wacky.

01:06:03
<transcript>: aw

01:06:15
<transcript>: Aws is better when you don't touch the dashboard. I have used pulumi for aws and is much better. Dev Experience yeah if you build apps the way you should build apps on aws, the developer experience is not that bad.

01:06:15
<transcript>: the developer

01:06:17
oscarmlage: hf guys seeyou!

01:06:35
<transcript>: The developer experience is going to be shaped by the infrastructure as code tools that you use. If you use the cdk cloudformation pulumi terraform, whatever you use, that's what is going to shape your developer experience. You shouldn't be building apps by going to the aws console and clicking around creating stuff. It's not deterministic. You can't reproduce that. It's just not a good way to build apps and.

01:06:35
<transcript>: yeah it's a

01:06:42
<transcript>: Yeah, it's a terrible developed experience, but if you're using something like sst or pulumi or cdk, way better.

01:06:42
<transcript>: way better

01:06:43
tom1269_: AWS console is a nightmare

01:06:44
<transcript>: Way better. Okay.

01:06:44
<transcript>: i did it

01:06:50
<transcript>: I did. It been an edgeman. I built the hype inside of you. I'm telling you, it's worth learning. I just wish more people.

01:06:54
<transcript>: It's not people's fault, that.

01:06:54
<transcript>: we're scaring people

01:06:54
levidayne: The amount of SAAS that ts/js devs are using vs just using something like rails + cloud provider is wild.

01:06:55
<transcript>: We're scaring people.

01:06:55
<transcript>: people

01:06:59
<transcript>: People are just scared to learn these things because they've heard all the horror stories.

01:06:59
<transcript>: or the

01:07:08
<transcript>: Or the terrible $40,000 bill that somebody woke up to. All of those cases are resolved. Aws doesn't come after you.

01:07:08
<transcript>: and

01:07:13
<transcript>: And bankrupt you they forgive those kind of bills all the time when they happen.

01:07:16
binajmen: I'll spent my weekend on testing SST and give you a feedback next week ;)

01:07:17
<transcript>: And you learn and it's not as scary as people make it sound.

01:07:25
cowfacedev: the issue is that most of the tutorials are focused on the console ui. and that kind of makes it a problem.

01:07:27
<transcript>: I always had an impression that aws was really pricey. Don't know where I got that from, though. Comparison to self hosted a certain point. So yeah, here's the thing about cloud pricing.

01:07:30
<transcript>: There will be people that will compare.

01:07:43
<transcript>: Cloud pricing, managed services, all the serverless stuff like, oh, well, per computer hours, it's so much more expensive. And yes, it is. But how much do you value the time it takes you to manage those servers.

01:07:43
<transcript>: that's the

01:07:52
julianfbeck: i mean by aws you pay more for better sla also

01:07:52
<transcript>: That's the whole serverless conversation. If you're somebody who really enjoys managing servers, you have a ton of experience in it. Maybe it's worth it to you. It's always going to be a trade off.

01:07:52
<transcript>: but

01:07:57
<transcript>: But you can kind of choose to take advantage of higher level services.

01:07:57
<transcript>: that abstract

01:08:01
<transcript>: That abstract stuff away. But aws is stupid, cheap.

01:08:09
<transcript>: It's much cheaper than any of these startups that are built on top of aws. Versailles is built on top of aws. They are inherently more expensive. They.

01:08:09
<transcript>: are adding

01:08:17
<transcript>: Are adding a surcharge on top of their AWS bill, but they don't even just add a charge. It scales.

01:08:19
cowfacedev: you can reach out to thdxr later when he comes online in the chat or when he streams. he is one of the devs in sst. @binajmen

01:08:21
<transcript>: Exponentially worse than AWS.

01:08:26
<transcript>: So aws is not the expensive option and I don't know that whole perception.

01:08:26
<transcript>: it's unfortun

01:08:29
<transcript>: It's unfortunate because.

01:08:29
<transcript>: aws

01:08:30
<transcript>: Aws, is this huge.

01:08:32
<transcript>: Grocery store.

01:08:37
nexxeln: hii what are we talking about

01:08:50
levidayne: I love serverless for job queue stuff but not front facing stuff. I use fargate for that

01:08:52
<transcript>: Of incredible primitives that you can build applications with. And they're very predictable. The prices only ever go down. It's Amazon. They're a trillion dollar company. Do you trust them? Or do you trust a series? A startup that made something that's an abstraction on top of it. Like, I'm telling you, it's not that scary. You can learn it. And there are skills.

01:08:52
<transcript>: that you'll

01:08:56
<transcript>: That you'll take with you on every project you work on.

01:08:57
tom1269_: Yeah once you ramp Vercel bill is crazy

01:09:00
<transcript>: It's worth learning. Barack. Thank you so much for that. Follow.

01:09:00
<transcript>: good day

01:09:02
<transcript>: Good Day. Wesley.

01:09:04
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:09:07
<transcript>: Now I am behind.

01:09:07
<transcript>: all the major

01:09:15
<transcript>: All the major cloud providers have too many things, and hence they are a pain to work with or a pain point to work with may it be gcp? Aws Azure Yeah.

01:09:18
tom1269_: But A+ for rapid prototyping

01:09:18
<transcript>: There is a lot to learn.

01:09:18
<transcript>: it's a huge

01:09:26
binajmen: @cowFaceDev good idea

01:09:34
<transcript>: It's a huge rabbit hole, but you don't need to learn if there's 300 aws services, I think there's like 270 something, 300 aws services. You need to know, like ten of them to build a modern web app and hardly even need to know anything about them these days. But things like SST.

01:09:43
<transcript>: There's just some really great patterns out there for building. I'm going to be talking about it a lot. You're going to see me doing it here on Stream. I'm going to be making videos about it.

01:09:43
<transcript>: the way to build

01:09:53
<transcript>: The way to build modern applications is not just nextjs app on versailles. And that's kind of the narrative right now is like, if you're not doing that, you're dumb. You're wasting your time. No, you're not.

01:10:01
<transcript>: Okay, steam? Veggies? What? Imposter? What are steam? Veggies? Did I say something about veggies.

01:10:08
<transcript>: Bowser with the bongos playing some bongos sipping on a drink lanery Good morning.

01:10:12
<transcript>: Hello, Oscar, Hello.

01:10:12
<transcript>: aw

01:10:23
tayloreddev: I've jumped into serverless recently I used a tool a lot like SST but for PHP it was actually quite easily to get something up and running

01:10:26
<transcript>: Aws console is a nightmare. It is. I'll agree with you on that front. The amount of saas that Tsjs are using versus just using something like rails plus cloud provider is wild. I agree with that. Take levi 100%.

01:10:35
<transcript>: I'll spend my weekend on testing ssd and give you feedback next week. Yes, please do. Ben Adjminn, I'm very excited to hear about your journey because.

01:10:39
<transcript>: You are the kind of person I really want to help right now.

01:10:42
impostorengineer: Toaster can't steam veggies, microwave does.

01:10:44
<transcript>: Like somebody who's curious and feels like it might be worth learning.

01:11:00
<transcript>: You're exactly the point where I hope to nudge you down that path. The greatest thing I ever did was just like we started building statues. We needed to build it on AWS, learning AWS to accomplish what we wanted to accomplish, and only what we needed to know to accomplish it.

01:11:03
<transcript>: It's changed my career completely.

01:11:12
kryotoboi: I am going for a call. Do you think it would be concern if they hear Adam in the background ?

01:11:14
nexxeln: adam this is funny, but our t3-oss account has been seeing random spikes in requests over the past few weeks. thankfully we're sponsored

01:11:14
shinta__: What is sst?

01:11:18
<transcript>: The issue is that most of the tutorials are focused on the console ui, and that kind of makes it a problem. Yeah. I'm going to be making some stuff about sst. I don't know if I'd call it Tutorials, but I'm going to be showing how I build web applications with SSD.

01:11:21
cowfacedev: LUL @ImpostorEngineer

01:11:22
nexxeln: sst.dev

01:11:23
<transcript>: Let's see I mean by AWS you pay more for better SLA also.

01:11:23
<transcript>: pay more

01:11:26
<transcript>: Pay more. Yeah. So you do like.

01:11:28
iannery: Stop it adam, you're convincing me to get over my fear of AWS shitty DX!

01:11:34
<transcript>: When you compare aws to like, Well, I could just get a vps for $20 a month and it has all these specs.

01:11:38
<transcript>: It's apples to oranges. They're not the same thing.

01:11:46
<transcript>: And it's the same when you compare versailles and aws, I mean, they're not the same thing with versailles. You're paying more.

01:11:46
<transcript>: for

01:11:52
shinta__: @nexxeln thanks

01:11:56
<transcript>: For some things that you don't get out of the box on AWS AWS. As a company not the best at building vertical experiences.

01:11:56
<transcript>: they have this great horror

01:11:57
<transcript>: They have this great horror.

01:12:03
<transcript>: Set of primitives. They're not great at building like an end to end developer experience.

01:12:03
<transcript>: so the community

01:12:11
<transcript>: So the community has kind of had to fill in the gaps there. And I think sst is the best example, but there's other great examples. Arc codes, architect.

01:12:11
<transcript>: and begin

01:12:14
<transcript>: And begin is their hosted version of that.

01:12:22
meccakin: i never heard about sst until now, glad to see i can use aws without being scared of its DX

01:12:22
<transcript>: I mean there's lots of community stuff. I mean Serverless was the original the og if you will serverless ink.

01:12:30
<transcript>: Yeah pulumi terraform like there's lots of ways to make the developer experience on aws, good.

01:12:44
<transcript>: You can reach. What did I just see it scrolled on me. You can reach out to dax later, when he comes online in the chat or when he streams. He's one of the deads in ssd. That's right, Ben. Adjminn. I don't know if that wasn't obvious. Sorry.

01:12:44
<transcript>: next

01:12:47
<transcript>: i think

01:12:47
<transcript>: Next where I just got to rant thing about AWS.

01:12:50
<transcript>: I think that's what it was about. Aws.

01:12:51
iannery: Terraform is kinda scary ngl

01:13:01
kryotoboi: Once upon a time there was Apache

01:13:05
<transcript>: Ranting about lots of things. I love serverless for job queue stuff, but not front facing stuff. I use Fargate for that. Yeah, and even Fargate is. I mean, serverless has no meaning anymore. As a word. It's just a marketing thing now.

01:13:05
<transcript>: so

01:13:14
<transcript>: So we can kind of ascribe whatever we want to it. I view Fargate as a more serverless option than running an EC two instance. Right.

01:13:16
kryotoboi: and all I needed was a cPanel NotLikeThis

01:13:19
<transcript>: Once you ramp versailles Bill is crazy, but a plus for rapid prototyping? Yeah, no.

01:13:32
<transcript>: I think build your next js apps put them on versailles. Just don't be scared to learn aws or to learn lower level primitives that all these other things are built on. Dax said something the other day.

01:13:32
<transcript>: to me

01:13:37
binajmen: Yeah I've been following your podcast, two wise people to hear while taking public transport. Not enough episodes though... :D

01:13:41
<transcript>: To me, not on a public setting, but he said something about, like, yeah, there needs to be more people explaining that people aren't getting well.

01:13:41
<transcript>: building their start

01:13:45
<transcript>: it's all

01:13:45
<transcript>: Building their startup on Versailles. They're getting wealthy by building Versailles.

01:13:48
stroopwafel26: ohai adam, welcome back to streaming

01:13:53
<transcript>: It's all these startups that we admire, upstash and versaille. Like all these things that we want to use? Well, those startups are built on AWS.

01:13:53
<transcript>: and

01:13:59
<transcript>: and it's yet

01:13:59
<transcript>: And it's not beyond your ability to learn those skills and to build startups like that.

01:14:04
<transcript>: And it's yet to be determined how many startups will come out built on top of those abstractions.

01:14:04
<transcript>: and still

01:14:06
<transcript>: And still.

01:14:06
<transcript>: be profit

01:14:14
iannery: Dax said it on stream yesterday haha

01:14:17
<transcript>: Be profitable and make it. You know what I mean? We don't have a ton of examples. The one example Lee threw at me on Twitter was Cal.com, and they're having a hard time with customers complaining about cold starts and everything else.

01:14:33
<transcript>: Once you ramp Versell bill is crazy. Okay, good idea. I've jumped into service recently. I use a tool a lot like ssc, but for php, it was actually quite easily to get something. Was it laravel Taylor? Were you using like laravel and vapor and everything.

01:14:47
<transcript>: Imposter. Thank you so much. Toaster can. Steamed veggies. Microwave does. Yeah. Toaster can't. Thank you. You help me with my analogy. Next. So I made a. I made an analogy.

01:14:47
<transcript>: and you might

01:14:49
<transcript>: And you might like it.

01:14:53
<transcript>: People want to say.

01:14:53
<transcript>: the developer

01:15:03
<transcript>: The developer experience on Ad Best is terrible. Versaille has an amazing developer experience. You cannot compare. You can't say versailles has a good developer experience, and aws has a bad one.

01:15:03
<transcript>: because it

01:15:11
nexxeln: trueing

01:15:24
<transcript>: Because it depends what you're building. Right? I got to refine this analogy. It's like saying a toaster is a better developer experience or a better cooking experience than a microwave. That's true if you're making toast. Not so true if you're making steamed veggies. Right? That's the analogy, like developer experience is totally dependent on what you're building. If.

01:15:24
<transcript>: you're building an app

01:15:26
<transcript>: You're building an app that has.

01:15:26
<transcript>: queues

01:15:46
<transcript>: Queues and it has Cron jobs and you've got events off of your database that are triggering asynchronous compute that's doing stuff. If you've got that good luck and with your developer experience building out of your cell, you can't. So developer experience is terrible because you have to go out and get third party solutions to all those problems. If you're building with SST.

01:15:46
<transcript>: excellent develop

01:15:52
nexxeln: using saas for everything you can't do in serverless is COPIUM

01:16:06
<transcript>: Excellent developer experience, building something like that with any complexity at all. And if you're building a startup, you're like going and raising venture capital, you're going to build something pretty complex over time. You're going to hire people. You're going to spend multiple years potentially work on this thing. It's going to be complex enough that it's probably worth the month of time. You'd invest into learning something new.

01:16:17
<transcript>: I just get so tired of the narrative that aws is scary and it has a bad developer experience. You don't want to have to deal with that. Just use versatile. You dumb, dumb like you don't need to learn things.

01:16:17

nexxeln: rice cooker is op

01:16:28
<transcript>: Cryo. I'm going for a call. Do you think it would be a concern if they hear Adam in the background.

01:16:28
<transcript>: depends

01:16:32
<transcript>: adam says

01:16:32
<transcript>: Depends. Are you on the phone with versailles because they might have a problem.

01:16:38
wesleycoder: I don't see the point against 3rd party solutions too

01:16:39
<transcript>: Adam says funny, but our T Three oss account has been seeing random spikes in requests over the past few weeks. Thankfully, we're sponsored.

01:16:43

01:16:46
<transcript>: Theo had pointed out yesterday he was having.

01:16:46
<transcript>: some bad

01:16:50
<transcript>: Some bad spikes. I think that was on the ping accounts, though.

01:16:56
<transcript>: Thankfully you're sponsored like versailles. Just pays your bill. Is that what you're saying.

01:17:01
<transcript>: My question to theo yesterday was, how do you deal with that on Versaille.

01:17:01
<transcript>: on aw

01:17:07
<transcript>: On aws there are deterministic services you can use to deal with.

01:17:07
<transcript>: ddos

01:17:07
nexxeln: yeah they pay our bills

01:17:08
<transcript>: Ddos, attacks.

01:17:11
<transcript>: On Versailles.

01:17:22
<transcript>: How do you deal with that? Do they have a mechanism, or is it just you contact support and say, like, hey, we're getting ddos. Please take care of it. Is that the solution? Shinta, welcome to chat.

01:17:25
tom1269_: But to be honest a lot of problems have much simpler solutions, but people always overcomplicate for no reason

01:17:27
<transcript>: Shinta. What is sst? There's a command for it.

01:17:27
<transcript>: there

01:17:28

01:17:47
<transcript>: Okay.

01:17:50
<transcript>: Let me catch up on chat.

01:17:56
<transcript>: Stop it. Adam. You're convinced me to get over my fear of AWS.

01:17:56
<transcript>: it's worth

01:17:59
<transcript>: It's worth getting over.

01:18:05
<transcript>: Bummer I can't see everyone's names now my chat is all messed up.

01:18:14
<transcript>: I never heard about ssd until now. I'm glad to see I can use aws without being scared of it. Cx yes, I'm so glad that someone has seen that because of this stream.

01:18:20
<transcript>: Terraform is kind of scary. Yeah. Terraform is pretty intense. Ssc is way less scary.

01:18:20
<transcript>: terraform

01:18:23
<transcript>: Terraform supports like everything.

01:18:28
laytanl_: I am here for opinions

01:18:42
<transcript>: Not just aws, like you want your github repos in your infrastructure as code. Like just everything. It supports everything. Ssc is like supports 2% of aws. It's this tiny sliver. It's like you're just building modern web applications, and you need all the trappings that come with that. Use SSC.

01:18:42
<transcript>: once upon a

01:18:47
<transcript>: Once upon a time there was apache, and all I needed was a cpanel.

01:19:07
<transcript>: You have been following your podcast two wise people to hear while talking, taking public transport. Not enough episodes. Oh, no. Ben Adjminn, you want more episodes? We were doing two a week and then we dropped down to one. I think we might start doing two joda. Thanks so much for that follow. I've been thinking how all of our episodes right now have been like, thematic. Like.

01:19:07
<transcript>: a topic

01:19:25
<transcript>: A topic. Something happened. We want to talk about it. I think we need to just start talking just like regularly. Just like what we would normally talk about. It could just be like, I mean, it's always going to be about technology and just we have a lot of similar interests. It's not like we're going to just start talking about soccer or something. I don't know.

01:19:34
<transcript>: But we don't have to have a thing that happened, like a news item that we're trying to talk because I think that got hard to do. Two a week. It's like there's not always two big things to talk about.

01:19:34
<transcript>: maybe just

01:19:39
<transcript>: Maybe just do like a mailbag. Like ask us questions. We'll just answer questions on some episodes.

01:19:44
<transcript>: I think things like that could be good. We got some recurring segments.

01:19:44
<transcript>: i don't know

01:19:45
<transcript>: I don't know.

01:19:45

01:20:27
iannery: Doesnt upstash rate limiting stuff mitigate DDOS attacks?

01:20:28
<transcript>: You're always going to benefit from making those trade offs.

01:20:28
<transcript>: if there's

01:20:38
<transcript>: If there's an opportunity. I love things like Upstash Planet Scale. Some of these third party suit services are great, and I'm not saying don't use them. I'm not even saying don't use roselle.

01:20:41
<transcript>: Early on. It's great. Just like, no.

01:20:53
<transcript>: How to escape when you need to and build skills and don't be afraid to build skills with lower level primitives and know that all of those things are options. I host tons of stuff on purcell because it's stuff that's never going to be huge.

01:26:49
<transcript>: people constantly

01:26:55
<transcript>: People constantly want to say like, oh, versaille has such a good developer experience. Aws is a terrible developer experience.

01:26:55
<transcript>: but

01:26:55
ukmadlz: Ow no, that tweets going to cause people to throw a benny\

01:26:57
<transcript>: But.

01:26:57
<transcript>: you can't really just

01:26:58
<transcript>: statically compare

01:26:58
<transcript>: You can't really just.

01:27:18
<transcript>: Statically compare those two things because it's about what you're building. If you're building a simple web app or a simple website that you just need to deploy and you need some synchronous Http requests as an api, then sure, the developer experience of our cell is great if you need something with cues and Cron jobs and complicated things because.

01:27:18
<transcript>: you're building

01:27:20
<transcript>: You're building a complicated system.

01:27:28
<transcript>: The developer experience on our sales terrible because it doesn't support those things. You have to go out and get other services to do it.

01:27:35
<transcript>: And so that's the analogy. The analogy is like a toaster is great at making toast. But if you need to make lasagna.

01:27:35
<transcript>: good luck

01:27:41
<transcript>: Good luck with your toaster. Versailles is the toaster. You know what I'm saying.

01:27:47
<transcript>: So anybody have a way to land this plane.

levidayne: Dont bring a bucket and spade if youre building a skyscraper

01:28:06
<transcript>: Let's go with lasagna. Next. I feel like steak. Yeah. I guess you can't make steak in a toaster. I feel like there's some. I just feel like lasagna has a lot of different things in it. You know what I'm saying? So it's complex. Toast is just like a piece of bread.

01:28:15
<transcript>: I like the White Bread is versailles analogy. Here. I'm into that. I feel like there's some db hosting services that are really easy to get out of when you need to. Yeah.

01:28:19
<transcript>: Like Planet Scale. It's just MySQL database.

01:28:24
<transcript>: I mean kind of I guess like it's the test and there's some things about it that are different, but.

01:28:25
vapor__dev: Maybe something about manual in race cars vs automatic gears in a car u commute in

01:28:33
kryotoboi: Breads are complicated

01:28:35
<transcript>: It's probably easier to eject out a planet scale than it is versaille. Right. Well, it's not so much as hard to eject out of or sell. It's hard if you build with nextjs and you take advantage of or sell, which is kind of like.

01:28:35
<transcript>: what all of

01:28:39
brn_rbn: vercel is great, unless you need more than bread

01:28:40
<transcript>: What all of nextjs is about is like, look how awesome it is on versaille. And it is.

01:28:48
<transcript>: But that's a hard thing to eject out of if you use versaille and nextjs for everything, and you just build your whole api and api routes or whatever.

01:28:48
<transcript>: that's where

01:28:51
<transcript>: That's where it gets hard to untangle and eject.

01:29:01
<transcript>: I think flavor of the month is air fryers lame welcome to my chat welcome, welcome to my chat food Technologies while nothing is sacred from you people.

01:29:01

<transcript>: Uk mod welcome to my chat. I'll know that Tweet is going to cost people to throw a binny. What's a Benny.

01:29:10
<transcript>: Versaille greater than excel.

01:29:11
pbertrand_dev: Question, how do you get the cheese on your lasagna crispy if you dont use a toaster?

01:29:15
yozd82: Vercel is like a versatile kitchen tool, perfect for baking bread and making desserts, but not suitable for cooking a large pot of stew or slow-roasting a whole turkey.

01:29:19
kryotoboi: Forget Vercel and AWS, buy your own server rack

01:29:20
<transcript>: Larbar Time? Who said it was Larbar Time? A toast to versaille. Don't bring a bucket and spade. If you're building a skyscraper exactly.

01:29:32
ukmadlz: Benny: British-ism for people complaining vocally

01:29:33
<transcript>: Levi. Maybe something about manual and race cars versus automatic gears in a car. No, guys, I already have the analogy. I don't need another analogy. Camel. Thank you so much for that tier one sub. I appreciate it. Camel.

01:29:44
<transcript>: I already have the analogy. I just need to figure out if I need to call out versaille directly and make sure this is I don't think it's very clear right now. Like if I just landed this, I just tweeted it.

01:29:44
<transcript>: this isn't

01:29:48
<transcript>: This isn't super clear, but if I say.

01:29:50

01:30:23
stroopwafel26: something else: i got a new job + a huge pay increase + i'm going 100% remote

01:30:25
<transcript>: Question. How do you get the cheese on your lasagna crispy? If you don't use a toaster? Wait, a toaster? I think we're talking about two different things. Are we talking about a different thing? Toaster? I'm talking about one of these. You like, stick bread in it? That's like all it does is you stick bread in it and you toast it.

01:30:25
<transcript>: you

01:30:36
caaamel: really enjoying your stream mate, cheers

01:30:37
<transcript>: You pull the lever down. It makes it toast. That's it not like a toaster oven. That's like a thing. You open up and stick stuff in. No, this is like bread will fit in there. And that is all.

01:30:37
<transcript>: you know

01:30:41
pbertrand_dev: Ahhh gotcha

01:30:44
kryotoboi: Thats a fancie toaster !

01:30:46
<transcript>: You know what I'm saying? Roselle is like a versatile kitchen tool, perfect for baking bread and making desserts. But not suitable for cooking a large pot of stew or slow roasting a whole Turkey.

01:30:48
<transcript>: Interesting.

01:30:49
vapor__dev: That’s a lasagna cooker where I’m from

01:30:52
<transcript>: I guess I think it's less versatile, but.

01:30:58

I mean, I have a minor following. So who cares? But if you guys all want to take this tweet to the moon to make my point for me, then there you go.

01:31:17

<transcript>: Let's see. Benny. British ism for people complaining vocally. Oh, people are going to complain about my tweet. You think I don't know? People don't usually see my tweets to complain about them. I'm doing something soap kit. Now, the portability compared to nextjs is bonkers. Thank you, Tom. Here's the thing. Here's the thing about portability.

01:31:57
<transcript>: Or here's the thing about next. Jess and Versaille.

01:31:59
<transcript>: say

01:31:59
<transcript>: People.

01:32:01
<transcript>: Say.

01:32:01
<transcript>: i got to be careful

01:32:08
<transcript>: I got to be careful here. I don't want to call individuals out. I really it's not my goal because I don't think any one person in this situation.

01:32:08
<transcript>: in what i call

01:32:16
<transcript>: In what I call the current narrative. I don't think anyone's at fault, and I don't think I know no one's maliciously acting. I just think it's like a collective.

01:32:24
<transcript>: Inertia or like the current of the river has flowed a certain way and people just get caught up in it. And that's just kind of how it goes.

01:32:24
<transcript>: but

01:32:32
<transcript>: But I think I've heard things like, how do I put this without directly calling out one specific thing? I don't know that I can.

01:32:34
<transcript>: The thing is.

01:32:47
ukmadlz: Dogmatic cultism of "this tool will solve it all"

01:32:54
<transcript>: It doesn't mean technology is good or bad if it's more portable. But some people value portability and you can't say that nextjs on versailles is as portable as something like Felt Kit or astro deployed to any hosting provider. They are more portable. That's just an objective fact doesn't mean it's good or bad. Some people value that.

01:33:07
<transcript>: And if you do, then you're going to probably prefer those technologies. You know what I'm saying? It's an objective fact that it is more complicated to deploy nextjs. And every time you say that.

01:33:07
<transcript>: certain

01:33:21
adjectiveallison: I replied to your tweet adam with creativity

01:33:27
<transcript>: Certain people will end up in your mentions on Twitter saying it's all open. We've done a ton of work to make sure it's easy to deploy. It's not easy to deploy, okay? You may not be intentionally gaslighting, but you're gaslighting like it's just not easy to deploy nextjs. Ask. Netlify. Ask. Aws. Ask sst. Ask anybody who's tried to deploy nextjs to their provider.

01:33:27
<transcript>: it's not

01:33:34
<transcript>: It's not easy. It's very complicated. And let's drop that narrative that it's simple. It's not. But that's okay.

01:33:34
<transcript>: you get

01:33:39
<transcript>: You get a lot for that. Like you get a lot for deploying ssh and Brazil, a lot for free. And that's fine.

01:33:39
<transcript>: there's value

01:33:46
<transcript>: There's value in that. And some people will value that over portability. But let's not pretend that it's portable. And it's just as portable.

01:33:46
<transcript>: or

01:33:57
<transcript>: Or it's actually portability. Doesn't matter. It does for some people. It does for some use cases anyway. Okay. I worked for a company once. I did advise a startup that did.

01:33:57
<transcript>: some pretty ex

01:34:00
<transcript>: Some pretty exotic weird stuff.

01:34:00
<transcript>: that

01:34:09
<transcript>: That they literally had to worry about getting shut down off of aws. They weren't doing like shady things, but they were operating in an area, like a certain type of business.

01:34:09
<transcript>: that

01:34:12
<transcript>: That it was very possible.

01:34:12
<transcript>: the cloud

01:34:19
<transcript>: The cloud provider could come after them and say, you're done here. You need to move on. You can't build this on AWS.

01:34:19
<transcript>: and

01:34:26
<transcript>: And they actually had a reason to need portability in this case, for cloud providers, not for their web hosting or whatever.

01:34:28
kryotoboi: I feel bad for Netlify . They need some attention as well

01:34:32
<transcript>: It happens. Some people do need that. And when they do, then suddenly, it's a very important topic.

01:34:32
<transcript>: so

01:34:40
<transcript>: So we can't just brush it aside and be like, who cares? Don't lease common denominator, like all that stuff. Okay. Anyway, I'm done.

01:34:44
<transcript>: For sales. An excellent toaster, but a shitty lasagna. That's funny.

01:34:46
<transcript>: Okay.

01:34:51
<transcript>: Really enjoying your stream, mate. Hey, good deal, camel. Thank you for that.

01:34:59
<transcript>: That's a fancy toaster. That was a fancy toaster. What was that? That we had pulled up there.

01:35:02
<transcript>: It's like gold plated.

01:35:09
<transcript>: This is quite a toaster. Okay, why do I have this Tweet open so many times.

01:35:14
<transcript>: Oh, I know why wait Twitter time.

01:35:14
<transcript>: is this from twitter

01:35:15
<transcript>: Is this from Twitter? Time.

01:35:15
<transcript>: is that

01:35:18
<transcript>: Is that why it's what.

01:35:18
<transcript>: i have like some

01:35:21
<transcript>: I have like some code that if you paste the Twitter link.

01:35:32
<transcript>: Into my twitch chat. It'll open it in my browser, but it's only supposed to do it when I do Twitter time. And I haven't done Twitter time. Have I done Twitter time? I think I did Oops.

01:35:39
<transcript>: So I may want to test it and post a Twitter link in my chat.

01:35:43
<transcript>: That's a lasagna cooker. From where I come that's funny.

11:59:31

11:59:41
<transcript>: first

11:59:53
<transcript>: First you need to install node. Here's how you install node, and then they're like, now you'll need to do npm init like, okay, I already have a project. I just need to solve this one little problem.

12:00:05

<transcript>: requ

12:03:30
<transcript>: Required date time. Right.

12:03:33
<transcript>: Okay.

12:03:43
<transcript>: Require versus use.

12:03:50
<transcript>: I'm actually going to see where have we done some daytime stuff already.

12:03:55
<transcript>: New Date time.

12:04:00
<transcript>: Requiring daytime daytime. Here.

12:04:00
<transcript>: oh

12:04:02
<transcript>: Oh calendar is different than date time.

12:04:05
<transcript>: Calendar is not the same thing.

12:04:05
<transcript>: interesting

12:04:13
<transcript>: Interesting or does required daytime. Give me the calendar. Are we not using calendar anywhere? There we go.

12:04:15
<transcript>: Calendar.

12:04:17
<transcript>: Iso.

12:04:20
<transcript>: Okay.

12:04:29
<transcript>: We'll just try the required date time thing.

12:04:31
<transcript>: See if that works.

12:04:37
<transcript>: What.

12:04:44
<transcript>: Function, calendar date. Okay, I guess it should tell me in the thing.

12:04:49
<transcript>: Here. Cruel. Thank you for the follow. I didn't see that. Sorry about that.

12:04:51
<transcript>: I appreciate.

12:04:51
<transcript>: every one of

12:04:56
<transcript>: Every one of you following me. I really do. We're closing in on 4000 followers.

12:04:58
<transcript>: So calendar.

12:05:01
<transcript>: What's it say.

12:05:01
<transcript>: let me find a private

12:05:02
pbertrand_dev: You were a freelancer right? Question, how long do you wait before counting a no show for a meeting? I just had one potential client not show for the first meeting and 15 min late for the second. They got angry when I said I wasn't interested anymore

12:05:07
<transcript>: Let me find a private call to missing or unexploded function excerend date.

12:05:07
<transcript>: is that actually a thing

12:05:08
<transcript>: Is that actually a thing.

12:05:12
<transcript>: And then what's the other one say.

12:05:18
<transcript>: Daytime news, undefined or private? Did you mean New two, three, or four.

12:05:18
<transcript>: no

12:05:20
<transcript>: No, I didn't.

12:05:30
blakegreendev: MacBook giveaway at 4k followers? Lol

12:05:32
<transcript>: Pete bertrand. You were a freelancer, right question. How long do you wait before counting a no show for a meeting.

12:05:39
<transcript>: I just had one potential client not show for the first meeting and 15 minutes late for the second. They got angry when I said I wasn't interested anymore.

12:05:44
<transcript>: So.

12:05:48
<transcript>: They didn't show up for the first meeting, and they were 15 minutes late for the second.

12:05:54
<transcript>: I think it really comes down to.

12:05:54
<transcript>: how many

12:05:57
<transcript>: How many opportunities do you have.

12:06:00
<transcript>: If you are.

12:06:06
pbertrand_dev: Its for a super small project too

12:06:08
<transcript>: You have like ten people at any moment you could DM them and they would wire you $10,000 to start on something.

12:06:08
<transcript>: if

12:06:23
<transcript>: If you have that many opportunities, then yeah, just tell them off, just like, I'm sorry you're wasting my time. If you don't and you need the work because you don't have a lot of opportunities right now and this will ebb and flow. It's not like you always have the same number of opportunities.

12:06:35
<transcript>: If you don't, though, you probably want to be a little more delicate with them because you need the work. So I think it's just like if you have the leverage, that's what's important. If they're getting angry, it might just be in how you delivered it.

12:06:39
<transcript>: I wonder, how did you deliver the message.

12:06:42
<transcript>: That you weren't interested anymore.

12:06:46
<transcript>: If you felt like you did your best to keep the piece.

12:06:46
<transcript>: but

12:06:57
<transcript>: But they were upset. There's nothing you can do, but maybe there's a learning opportunity. If there was a way you could have delivered it, that they would have been less upset. I don't know. It also depends on how much you care that they're upset.

12:06:59
pbertrand_dev: Yeah I am always very nice

12:07:10
<transcript>: I have a personality where I cannot handle when people are upset with me, so it bothers me a lot, but I wish I weren't that way. I wish I could just brush it off.

12:07:16
<transcript>: It's for a super small project, too. Always. Very nice. Yeah. You did your best. I don't know.

12:07:17
pbertrand_dev: I am just not sure if waiting 15 min is too short

12:07:20
<transcript>: What can you do? Some people are just going to get angry.

12:07:29
<transcript>: Oh, if waiting 15 minutes is too short. No. If they blew off the first call and then they were late to the second. I think you have plenty of grounds.

12:07:29
<transcript>: for just

12:07:34
kryotoboi: I am upset with you Adam PoroSad

12:07:38
pbertrand_dev: Thanks

12:07:43
pbertrand_dev: Yeah got strong bad vibes

12:07:43
<transcript>: For just moving on. Bad clients let themselves be known pretty quickly. You'll know, when they're a bad client pretty early, they don't just suddenly become a bad client. They have little signs like that. And you don't want to waste your time with bad clients. It's not fun. I've had them.

12:07:43
<transcript>: i

12:07:46
<transcript>: I'm upset with you. Adam. Stop it. Cryo.

<transcript>: Now waiting for number is prime. Built in function OOH.

12:12:18
<transcript>: is that

12:12:23
<transcript>: Is that you're saying an elixir. You want that to be in the elixir. Common stuff.

12:12:35
<transcript>: I've heard nice things about elixir. Is this the main backend language for stat? Muse? Good question, Rick. What is the back end, anyway? That's the existential question, isn't it.

12:12:38
<transcript>: It is the back end for our front end.

12:12:38
<transcript>: if you will

12:12:40
<transcript>: If you will.

12:12:44
<transcript>: So it's the server that serves our front end.

12:13:00
<transcript>: There is a lot of api stuff happening there, but the back end, back end of Sat muse is that sharp. All the nlp stuff like where we actually answer your question and do like the sports data queries and all that stuff that's all in other stuff. F sharp mostly.

12:13:04
itsmeleague: Say his full name, curious how you pronounce stroopwafel LUL

12:13:06
<transcript>: So we have a lot of services at Sat muse. We didn't start that way. It's just kind of like, evolved.

12:13:06
<transcript>: we have

12:13:13
uberrick: ah okay so the BFF proxy

12:13:18
<transcript>: We have services that handle stitching together audio files to answer questions on alexa and Google Assistant. We have services that create images dynamically based on colors and players.

12:13:21
<transcript>: And year.

12:13:21
<transcript>: we have illustration

12:13:32
<transcript>: We have illustrations for players across their careers. Let me show you this. No one asked this question, but I'm going to show you anyway. If we go to Satus.com and we say, like Dennis Rodman.

12:13:41
kryotoboi: Stitching together audiophiles ? sounds painful

12:13:51
<transcript>: So Dennis rodman had all these crazy hairstyles. So we have illustrations with him throughout his career, on different teams. So here is when he was with the mavericks, I guess the Lakers, the Bulls, the spurs and the pistons. So we have illustrations for him in different years.

12:13:51
<transcript>: and on

12:13:54
<transcript>: And on different teams with different hairstyles, whatever.

12:13:55
itsmeleague: Lol @kryotoboi

12:14:01
<transcript>: And we have services that take a given year and a player and generate one of these images.

12:14:01
<transcript>: for

12:14:08
<transcript>: For metadata. So like og images and stuff like that. Anyway, our back end is lots of things.

12:14:08
<transcript>: but

12:14:10
itsmeleague: Surely illegal too

12:14:11
<transcript>: But elixir is like the back end for our front end.

12:18:29
<transcript>: let's see

12:18:30
<transcript>: Let's see.

12:18:30
<transcript>: we've got

12:18:36
<transcript>: We've got repo one. This doesn't work. I need to figure out there's got to be a way.

12:18:36
<transcript>: in

12:18:38
<transcript>: In ecto.

12:18:38
<transcript>: elix

12:18:40
<transcript>: Elixir ecto.

12:18:40
<transcript>: count

12:18:42
<transcript>: Count.

darrenbaldwin03: Is statemuse in Astro now?

12:18:52
<transcript>: From P in people Select Count pid. Why can't I do that.

12:18:52
<transcript>: altern

12:18:54
<transcript>: Alternatively.

12:18:54
<transcript>: we can

12:18:55
ghostyx101: adamdevKappa_TK

12:19:03
<transcript>: We can use the fragment one function to use postgres's count function. Lastly, Aggregate provides account option.

12:19:08
<transcript>: Okay. So we could do that. I don't like that. I have to provide the table name.

12:19:13
<transcript>: Extraordinarily.

12:19:16
<transcript>: Oh, I don't have to.

12:19:16
<transcript>: i don't

12:19:17
<transcript>: I don't have to.

12:19:21
<transcript>: Because. Okay. Let's just do this.

12:19:25
<transcript>: Instead of one. Let's do aggregate.

12:19:26
<transcript>: And then.

12:19:26
<transcript>: the query

12:19:32
<transcript>: The query is piped in already. So then I just need to provide the count.

12:19:32
<transcript>: all

12:19:36
<transcript>: All right, I seem to provide count.

12:19:36
<transcript>: and

12:19:37
<transcript>: And ID.

12:19:40
<transcript>: Is that right.

12:19:43
<transcript>: Can't expect what did it say.

12:19:43
<transcript>: undefined

12:19:44
<transcript>: Undefined.

12:19:44
<transcript>: date beginning

12:19:47
<transcript>: Date beginning of month is not what.

12:19:59
<transcript>: Is not a valid query expression. If you want to invoke an equation, make sure that the module date is required and that beginning of date is a macro. Oh, can I just do this.

12:20:03
<transcript>: No, not that.

12:20:06
<transcript>: This.

12:20:08
<transcript>: Do that.

12:20:12
<transcript>: Date.

12:20:12
<transcript>: it said

12:20:15
<transcript>: It said I had to require dates or something.

12:20:15
<transcript>: does this

12:20:17
<transcript>: Does this work.

12:20:20
<transcript>: Oh, man, if this works.

12:20:22
<transcript>: Be so pleased.

12:20:34
<transcript>: What was I going to do? Counting records with ecto.

12:20:44
<transcript>: Versus select count. Yeah. What's the difference? Is it the same performance.

12:20:50
<transcript>: That you're able to choose whether to apply it to existing queries. Your first name will be built into your query as your second example.

12:20:54
<transcript>: That builds a slick query and updates the query map. Okay.

12:20:58
<transcript>: Both will generate similar SQL.

12:21:01
<transcript>: You can compose query. Okay.

12:21:06
<transcript>: So I think I'm good with the aggregate thing.

12:21:09
<transcript>: I think I'm good with that.

12:21:29
<transcript>: Is state muse in astronaut. It's actually stat muse. We're rewriting it in astros. So I'm in the middle of a rewrite, but I'm adding some stuff in the meantime, because a rewrite is going to take longer than expected. Everything takes longer than expected because the rewrit.

12:21:29
<transcript>: rewrite is taken

12:21:34
<transcript>: Rewrite is taken a bit. I'm just doing something here in the existing app.

12:21:36
<transcript>: And not waiting.

12:21:41
uberrick: statemuse JS your new state management lib

12:21:41
<transcript>: So here's what I want to do. I want to test this function, but I don't know how to.

12:21:46
<transcript>: Fake a user, so I'm just going to actually test it live.

12:21:53
<transcript>: User ask count. So now I'm going to go to my enforcer.

12:21:59
<transcript>: And I'm going to say, User, let's see.

12:22:01
<transcript>: We're going to say.

12:22:01
<transcript>: get

12:22:03
<transcript>: Get.

12:22:09
<transcript>: User ask.

12:22:09
<transcript>: that you provide

12:22:11
<transcript>: That you provide a user.

12:22:16
<transcript>: So I need to provide the user in order to do that.

12:22:22
<transcript>: I'm going to do something different here.

12:22:22
<transcript>: i'm going to say

12:22:24
<transcript>: I'm going to say case.

12:22:27
<transcript>: User.

12:22:34
<transcript>: It's like.

12:22:37
<transcript>: Get user or something.

12:22:40
<transcript>: Where did I see this? Recently.

12:22:43
<transcript>: User session.

12:22:50
<transcript>: I recently saw this.

12:22:54
<transcript>: I recently saw it. Maybe it's just in my history.

12:22:54
<transcript>: there's

12:22:59
nexxeln: grep it

12:23:03
<transcript>: There's like a case statement where we were checking if there is a current user and it was so nice. It's exactly what I need. Where are you.

12:23:03
<transcript>: show

12:23:06
<transcript>: Show yourself. Not there.

12:23:08
<transcript>: No.

12:23:08
<transcript>: this right

12:23:10
<transcript>: This right here.

12:23:16
<transcript>: List user asks okay, so let's go back to enforcer.

12:23:21
<transcript>: Yeah, I was trying to grep it, and I couldn't remember what it was called.

12:23:26
<transcript>: State News js. Your new State Management library.

12:23:28
<transcript>: That's funny.

12:23:28
<transcript>: whoa

12:23:33
<transcript>: Whoa, ghosty, how do you have that little hand on my face? That's awesome.

12:23:41
<transcript>: This little thing on my little cap of face. That's so good. I don't know how you did that. That's super cool.

12:23:43
<transcript>: Okay.

12:23:43
<transcript>: case off

12:23:45
<transcript>: Case off. Let's see.

12:23:53
<transcript>: Auth user getcurrent user and if there is a user we're going to do ask.

12:23:53
<transcript>: asks

12:23:54
<transcript>: Asks.

12:24:04
<transcript>: Get user ask, count. That's what we did. That's what we wrote. And then reduce what's this about.

12:24:08
<transcript>: I don't need to reduce statement.

12:24:10
<transcript>: Don't need that.

12:24:13
<transcript>: So we're just going to end.

12:24:21
<transcript>: User and then enum reverse. No. So here's the thing. Now at this point.

12:24:23
nexxeln: modify channel emote channel redeem

12:24:24
<transcript>: I have account.

12:24:29
<transcript>: I have account of their users.

12:24:31
<transcript>: Their queries.

12:24:39
<transcript>: And I'm going to say, what is wrong with this cannot expand user. I think I have to import user.

12:24:42
<transcript>: Code actions that'd be cool.

12:24:47
<transcript>: Off user.

12:24:57
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow, I think. Yes. Wesley MP.

12:24:57
<transcript>: in the spot

12:24:59
<transcript>: In the spot. Ui.

12:25:01
<transcript>: Thank you for the follows.

12:25:03
<transcript>: Model.

12:25:03
<transcript>: modified

12:25:09
<transcript>: Modified channel emote. Channel redeem. Oh, I've seen that before. That's what that is.

12:25:11
<transcript>: So.

12:25:11
<transcript>: i need

12:25:11
codingrob: Hey! Interesting to see you use elixr, I tried it out briefly a few weeks ago but I found that language server support was lacking or the language is not typed?

12:25:15
<transcript>: I need to alias users, user.

12:25:21
<transcript>: List user asks.

12:25:23
<transcript>: Here.

12:25:26
<transcript>: Alias.

12:25:29
<transcript>: Offer.

12:25:36
<transcript>: Users user okay.

12:25:44
<transcript>: Cool now user should be defined. I mean it's so slow like the lsp or whatever is giving me all this information is very slow.

12:25:59
<transcript>: Coding. Rob hey, interesting to see you use elixir. I tried out briefly a few weeks ago, but I found that language service support was lacking, or the language is not Typed. It's not Typed. It's not a type thing.

12:25:59
<transcript>: the ls

12:26:03
<transcript>: The lsp is okay. It is super slow.

12:26:03
<transcript>: this is

12:26:08
<transcript>: This is pretty giant. Like this is a giant giant repo. Okay.

12:26:17
nexxeln: its not typed thats why the lsp doesn't have a lot of features

12:26:18
<transcript>: Files on files on file. It's giant. Okay, this is a giant elixir repo. So that's probably why my lsp is so slow.

12:26:24
<transcript>: But it is annoying, whether it's because of our repo being too big or not. Still annoying.

12:26:29
<transcript>: That's not tight. That's why the lsp doesn't have a lot of features. Yeah.

12:26:29
<transcript>: i can't do

12:26:34
<transcript>: I can't do a lot of things that I want to do. I can go to definition, but.

12:26:37
<transcript>: I can't. Like, what was I just trying to do a second ago.

12:26:37
<transcript>: i

12:26:42
<transcript>: I do something I was trying to get code actions to import for me. Couldn't do that.

12:26:43
<transcript>: That kind of thing.

12:26:43
<transcript>: kind of

12:26:48
<transcript>: Kind of annoying anikar. Thank you for the follow. Anika.

12:26:52
<transcript>: Okay. So what are we doing here.

12:26:52
<transcript>: this count

12:26:57
<transcript>: This count is unused. So now here's what we're doing. I'm trying to figure out.

12:26:58
<transcript>: Let's see.

12:27:01
sl4ught3rsl: Is it just me or the video and audio is out of sync?

12:27:01
<transcript>: In this case.

12:27:06
<transcript>: If there isn't a user.

12:27:06
<transcript>: so if

12:27:14
<transcript>: So if you're not logged in right now, I'm just going to say false. You cannot query unless you're logged in. That's not going to be the end result. But I just want to test this stuff.

12:27:18
<transcript>: Okay. So what I actually need to do.

12:27:22
<transcript>: To do get visitor.

12:27:22
<transcript>: check

12:27:23
stroopwafel26: refresh the stream

12:27:25
<transcript>: Check query count.

12:27:32
<transcript>: But for the case where you are logged in here we get the count of your asks and we return.

12:27:32
<transcript>: count

12:27:38
<transcript>: Count is less than one or less than five. I'm just testing.

12:27:38
<transcript>: if

12:27:40
<transcript>: If count is less than five.

12:27:46
<transcript>: Then you can query otherwise you cannot.

12:27:46
<transcript>: how do

12:27:50
<transcript>: How do I log? How do I log in elixir.

12:27:52
<transcript>: Lock.

12:27:52
<transcript>: logger

12:27:54
<transcript>: Logger.

12:27:58
sl4ught3rsl: Oh nice it's ok now thanks

12:27:58
<transcript>: No, I think there's an easier way.

12:27:58
<transcript>: log

12:27:59
<transcript>: Log.

12:28:03
nexxeln: IO.puts

12:28:03
<transcript>: logger

12:28:04
<transcript>: Logger.

12:28:08
nexxeln: IO.inspect

12:28:18
<transcript>: Logger debug services ask. Okay. So this is how I did it.

12:28:18
<transcript>: okay

12:28:19
<transcript>: Okay.

12:28:21
<transcript>: Log the count.

12:28:27
nexxeln: oh nvm you have a Logger thing

12:28:36
<transcript>: Does that work. You can tell me. I can't do that. Params is unused. It's true.

12:28:42
<transcript>: Undefined function log level expected. What.

12:28:48
<transcript>: Expected motor web enforced you to find such a function I have to import.

12:28:48
<transcript>: logger

12:28:49
<transcript>: Logger.

12:28:49
<transcript>: where

12:28:51
<transcript>: Where is logger.

12:28:58
<transcript>: Require logger.

12:29:05
<transcript>: Here we go.

12:29:10
<transcript>: Oh, it's already. What.

12:29:14
<transcript>: Is log level undefined. Yeah.

12:29:19
<transcript>: Log level.

12:29:19
<transcript>: okay

12:29:20
<transcript>: Okay.

12:29:24
<transcript>: Do I have to provide log level.

12:29:24
<transcript>: what

12:29:26
<transcript>: What is that.

12:29:29
<transcript>: String to existing atom.

12:29:34
<transcript>: I just copy and paste this.

12:29:39
<transcript>: I just do that.

12:29:43
<transcript>: No. Is this not where I wanted to be.

12:29:46
<transcript>: Can't do that.

12:29:51
<transcript>: Oh, this isn't the enforcer.

12:30:02
<transcript>: Okay. I'm not going to log it. We're just going to test it. And if it tests it'll, tell us what we need to know. I mean, it is going to show us if it works or not.

12:30:05
<transcript>: I o put oh, I o put.

12:30:05
<transcript>: oh never

12:30:08
<transcript>: Oh, never mind you have a logger thing.

12:30:08
aaaaliou: I think you can use :info as log level

12:30:12
<transcript>: Well, maybe this will work too. Io puts count.

12:30:22
<transcript>: You can use info as log level ooh. Thank you. So we can just say like I can use an atom. Just info.

12:30:31
<transcript>: I think for the follow rzo? Rizzo resou Razzo Rizzo as in yoast.

12:30:35
<transcript>: Where's dax? I should start talking about dax. So he shows up.

12:30:35
<transcript>: is it

12:30:40
<transcript>: Is it just me? Or the video and audio is out of sync? Oh, no. Welcome to my Chat slaughter.

12:30:40
<transcript>: welcome

12:30:45
<transcript>: Welcome to my chat. Is it out of sync? I don't know. Somebody tell me, am I out of sync.

12:30:47
<transcript>: Hello.

12:30:47
<transcript>: i'm talking

12:30:51
stroopwafel26: dax where u at

12:30:52
<transcript>: I'm talking here's a clap? Am I out of sync? No. Dropped frames.

12:30:55
orlinthemage: not for me

12:30:55
yozd82: no not out of sync

12:31:03
codingrob: maybe a little bit but not really noticable

12:31:07
<transcript>: Just let me know if I'm out of sync. I don't want to be out of sync. No, not out of sync. Try refreshing your page, slaughter. Sometimes that works. Oh, nice. It's okay now. Cool. Oh, street probably told you. I mean, stroke strobe. I told you.

12:31:07
crisantogo: It's good for me .

12:31:10
<transcript>: Not noticeable. Okay, cool.

12:31:14
stroopwafel26: joostwafel

12:31:17
<transcript>: Let's test this thing.

12:31:17
<transcript>: let's

12:31:19
<transcript>: Let's test it.

12:31:25
<transcript>: Yoast waffle.

12:31:30
<transcript>: Dax. Dax, sucks.

12:31:35
<transcript>: How bad does dax suck? Every time I talk about bad daxes, he shows up.

12:31:39
<transcript>: Remember time. Dax was such a nerd. And he did that nerdy thing.

12:31:40
stroopwafel26: who's dax

12:31:42
<transcript>: Dax, what a nerd.

12:31:42
<transcript>: who

12:31:44
<transcript>: Who's? Dax.

12:31:47
<transcript>: It's not working.

12:31:47
<transcript>: where are

12:31:49
<transcript>: Where are you? Dax.

12:31:52
binajmen: I think it's like Beetlejuice. You have to say his name 3 times

12:31:52
<transcript>: Okay. So we just spun this back up.

12:31:52
<transcript>: we're

12:31:55
<transcript>: We're going to refresh this page.

12:32:00
<transcript>: And it's like beetlejuice. You have to say his name three times. Dax, axe.

12:32:06
binajmen: :D

12:32:09
<transcript>: No. Okay. Is it because I took a week off last week? Did dax just forget about me.

12:32:18
<transcript>: Did he even stream yesterday? Did dax stream yesterday? Uhoh, is anyone on dax watch.

12:32:18
<transcript>: is he depressed

12:32:20
<transcript>: Is he depressed? From the russ news.

12:32:20
<transcript>: both

12:32:26
<transcript>: Both points in a game, you know, most points in a game was my first ooh. What happened.

12:32:35
4ohfournotfound: Dax is like "who is Adam"?

12:32:38
<transcript>: What that was the first queer I ever asked at me was when I built the prototype most points in a game. And when it came back with wilt chamberlain, I knew we had something special.

12:32:42
<transcript>: Dax is like, who is Adam? Oh, no.

12:32:42
<transcript>: what

12:32:46
<transcript>: What's going on here? Why we got bad requests. What happened.

12:32:53
<transcript>: Cast error http API called with what.

12:32:57
<transcript>: Basic off? Oh, I'm not logged in, but it shouldn't matter.

12:33:02
<transcript>: Let's see can query calls get current user.

12:33:02
<transcript>: and that return

12:33:07
<transcript>: And that returns false. Let's see. Can query.

12:33:07
<transcript>: i guess

12:33:10
<transcript>: I guess I should have called it can ask.

12:33:10
<transcript>: maybe

12:33:10
stroopwafel26: dax isn't here because he thinks this stream is cringe fyi

12:33:11
<transcript>: Maybe.

12:33:11
<transcript>: so

12:33:16
<transcript>: So I'm trying to ask a query. King query. And it says redirect.

12:33:19
<transcript>: What's the problem.

12:33:19
<transcript>: what's the problem

12:33:20
<transcript>: What's the problem.

12:33:20
<transcript>: this one

12:33:23
<transcript>: This one should be the one that's doing create from post right here.

12:33:28
<transcript>: True do true false.

12:33:30
<transcript>: Redirect.

12:33:35
<transcript>: Con two pro. What's the problem.

12:33:43
<transcript>: Dax isn't here because he thinks this stream is cringe.

12:33:43
<transcript>: that makes sense

12:33:45
<transcript>: That makes sense. Did you actually ask him.

12:33:45
<transcript>: is that

12:33:51
<transcript>: Is that what he said? Sounds like something he would say. What did I do? Did I break things.

12:33:54
uberrick: what's that warning regarding the type?

12:33:55
<transcript>: Save all the files. Maybe I missed a file or something.

12:34:03
<transcript>: Let's look at the response more closely. What's the warning regarding the type? Oh, is there a warning? Oh, that's just saying it can never be true.

12:34:07
<transcript>: Because well, that's not true anymore. I updated.

12:34:07
<transcript>: ken queer

12:34:20
<transcript>: Ken queer this isn't true anymore. It can be true kind of true can never match the type false so it thinks can query can only be false. But now we have a true case. It can be true if this is less than five.

12:34:23
<transcript>: You know what I'm saying.

12:34:23
<transcript>: you know what

12:34:24
<transcript>: You know what I'm saying.

12:34:30
<transcript>: Can query.

12:34:36
<transcript>: Unused alias runtime settings. Did I break something? I might have broke something.

12:34:39
<transcript>: Enforcer.

12:34:39
<transcript>: very

12:34:42
<transcript>: Very possible that I broke something.

12:34:44
<transcript>: Let's see here.

12:34:49
<transcript>: Ask slash most points in a game.

12:34:53
<transcript>: This way Sent a request we could not understand.

12:34:55
<transcript>: Interesting.

12:35:00
<transcript>: I've never seen that error in all my days at sammy's.

12:35:00
<transcript>: invalid

12:35:05
<transcript>: Invalid Dom property. Note that's on it. Let's look at the network tab. Let's do another request.

12:35:08
<transcript>: And it says.

12:35:11
<transcript>: Ask.

12:35:15
<transcript>: What.

12:35:22
<transcript>: What does it say? Payload.

12:35:22
<transcript>: there's

12:35:26
<transcript>: There's the question most points in the game conversation token.

12:35:26
<transcript>: preview

12:35:34
<transcript>: Preview response. What? Okay, so there's a problem. There is an issue.

12:35:41
<transcript>: Most Points in a season.

12:35:43
<transcript>: Let's see.

12:35:43
<transcript>: let's search

12:35:47
<transcript>: Let's search that error message. Looks like your browser sent a request.

12:35:47
<transcript>: looks

12:35:50
<transcript>: Looks like your browser.

12:35:55
<transcript>: This is render error view.

12:36:05
<transcript>: Let's try this. Let's try. So this is where it does it create from post. Let's see this.

12:36:12
aaaaliou: is it returning the logged out HTML?

12:36:18
<transcript>: Now I've just commented out all that code.

12:36:18
<transcript>: returning

12:36:20
<transcript>: Returning the logged out HTML.

12:36:20
<transcript>: i

12:36:22
<transcript>: I don't know.

12:36:23
aaaaliou: and the frontend is expecting some JSON or something?

12:36:25
<transcript>: This most points in a game.

12:36:28
<transcript>: Now that I've just.

12:36:32
<transcript>: Oh what's wrong with this true can never mess a type what.

12:36:34
<transcript>: Params.

12:36:44
<transcript>: Oh, that was just a stale error. Okay, so it's working now. It is something with my enforcer code.

12:36:49
<transcript>: It's something wrong here.

12:36:55
<transcript>: So can query is returning false and maybe the redirect is failing. Maybe.

12:36:58
<transcript>: Let's try this.

12:37:00
<transcript>: Let's try.

12:37:03
<transcript>: Mamma.

12:37:10
<transcript>: Try like this redirect.

12:37:12
<transcript>: To.

12:37:15
<transcript>: Pro.

12:37:18
<transcript>: I don't know why this would matter.

12:37:18
<transcript>: that shouldn't change

12:37:21
<transcript>: That shouldn't change. But then do this. Halt.

12:37:27
<transcript>: I used to have this.

12:37:30
<transcript>: Okay.

12:37:30
<transcript>: so

12:37:33
<transcript>: So halt, let's try this.

12:37:39
nefine_: haltAndCatchFire()

12:37:41
thdxr: is Adam working

12:37:47
<transcript>: Dax is here.

12:37:47
<transcript>: he's here

12:37:56
<transcript>: He's here. Looks like your browser. Okay, that's expected. Now if I ask a question in the bar. Most points this season. Dax. I was even still doesn't work.

12:37:56
<transcript>: still

12:37:58
<transcript>: Still doesn't work.

12:38:05
<transcript>: Dax, I was even saying bad things about you, like five minutes ago, trying to get you to show up. You didn't show up.

12:38:07
<transcript>: Halt and catch fire.

12:38:09
thdxr: wow

12:38:10
wesleycoder: Dax is tha man

12:38:13
<transcript>: So why is this not work? It's like the redirect is not working.

12:38:16
stroopwafel26: hey dax

12:38:18
uberrick: had to disable vod's it got that bad @thdxr

12:38:21
uberrick: for your own good

12:38:24
<transcript>: Someone said it's like beetlejuice. I have to say your name three times. Tried that. Then I decided you just didn't like me anymore because I didn't stream last week, the week off.

12:38:24
<transcript>: it was just too

12:38:25
thdxr: hello

12:38:27
<transcript>: It was just too much for you. And you just gave up on me.

12:38:27
<transcript>: had

12:38:28
thdxr: lol

12:38:31
<transcript>: Had to disable vods. It got that bad DAX.

12:38:34
<transcript>: That's funny.

12:38:38
<transcript>: We've been talking about sst, DAX.

12:38:51
<transcript>: We had a lot of talking about sst today. I don't understand why it still thinks true is not a pattern that can happen because it sure is. Look at this. Maybe instead of that, let's just say true.

12:38:51
<transcript>: but

12:38:54
<transcript>: But in the case where there is a user.

12:38:54
<transcript>: in the

12:38:57
thdxr: so tired of hearing about SST

12:38:57
<transcript>: In the case where there is a user, it should just return true.

12:39:00
aaaaliou: are you sure the enforcer is returning the correct value? the warning is weird

12:39:06
<transcript>: Llsp just this slow. Is this, like just so out of date? Because this thing is huge.

12:39:08
<transcript>: That's a problem.

12:39:08
<transcript>: that is

12:39:12
<transcript>: That is just not true. It can be true.

12:39:16
uberrick: "Where did you see SST?!"

12:39:18
<transcript>: Are you sure the enforcer turning the correct value? The warning is weird.

12:39:20
<transcript>: I'm not sure.

12:39:23
<transcript>: I'm not entirely sure.

12:39:23
<transcript>: so

12:39:25
<transcript>: So tired of hearing about SSD.

12:39:25
<transcript>: oh

12:39:28
<transcript>: Oh, it was a little delayed there.

12:39:28
thdxr: Adam ignore dialyzer lol

12:39:31
thdxr: it sucks

12:39:34
<transcript>: So true like right here it should be true.

12:39:37
thdxr: I always had it turned off

12:39:38
<transcript>: Pace. If there's a user return, let's just do this.

12:39:40
<transcript>: If there is a user.

12:39:40
<transcript>: return true

12:39:43
<transcript>: Return true else false.

12:39:47
<transcript>: Right? Am I crazy.

12:39:47
<transcript>: am

12:39:49
<transcript>: Am I crazy.

12:39:49
<transcript>: i guess

12:40:01
<transcript>: I guess that's a side discussion. If I'm crazy or not ignore dialyzer, it sucks. I always had it turned off. Oh, really? Okay, so this just ignore this. I knew it was at least really behind. Because.

12:40:06
<transcript>: It takes forever to update there goes now, it can be true.

12:40:16
<transcript>: So now it should work if I type a question because there is a logged in user most points in a game.

12:40:22
<transcript>: There is logged in user. It should return true and it should just do the query. I think.

12:40:24
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

12:40:29
<transcript>: If I log out, let's just do this. Just test all this.

12:40:29
<transcript>: off

12:40:34
<transcript>: Off sign out. I'm logged out if I say most points in a game.

12:40:41
wesleimp: you can use a simple if/else in that case, right?

12:40:43
<transcript>: It should fail. You should definitely upgrade to Pro. I don't know. This page seems pretty good. I don't know if it needs anything else.

12:40:49
<transcript>: That's a new page. I just stood up. You can use a simple if else in that case. Right.

12:40:49
<transcript>: yes

12:40:53
<transcript>: Yes, it shouldn't be a case statement. Yeah. Good point.

12:40:55
<transcript>: Good point.

12:40:56
thdxr: no else

12:41:00
thdxr: always case

12:41:01
<transcript>: So I'm going to be honest. I don't know if I've ever done an if statement in elixir.

12:41:01
<transcript>: there's not

12:41:03
<transcript>: There's not a lot of them in here.

12:41:05
<transcript>: There's one.

12:41:08
sheppo162: What desk matt do you use?

12:41:13
<transcript>: A lot of case statements, not a lot of if else. So if.

12:41:16
<transcript>: Enforcer can query.

12:41:21
<transcript>: No yank to D.

12:41:22
nexxeln: if else is cringe

12:41:29
<transcript>: No.

12:41:29
<transcript>: fail

12:41:29
thdxr: accurate

12:41:31
<transcript>: Fail. What did I do.

12:41:33
<transcript>: Let's just do this.

12:41:37
<transcript>: Enforcer.

12:41:37
<transcript>: can

12:41:39
<transcript>: Can query.

12:41:42
<transcript>: Con params.

12:41:45
<transcript>: So if can like that.

12:41:52
<transcript>: If it can do that, then we're going to say.

12:41:56
<transcript>: Like that.

12:41:59
uberrick: yeah it's pretty clear what pattern is being matched with case

12:42:01
<transcript>: Else it's going to do this.

12:42:04
uberrick: Very Rust like Adam ;)

12:42:09
<transcript>: I can delete all this now.

12:42:09
<transcript>: it

12:42:24
<transcript>: It doesn't solve our problem. That's nice that we just did an if statement. Now if else is cringe. Oh, no, just as I made the change, too. Wesley, welcome to my chat. I appreciate when people join my chat.

12:42:24
<transcript>: no

12:42:29
<transcript>: No elf always case. Oh, really, dex? Is that why there's so few SL.

12:42:29
<transcript>: sls

12:42:36
<transcript>: Sls. What desk? Mat. Do you use it's from Grove Made. Sheppo. Welcome to Chad as well. Thank you for joining.

12:42:42
<transcript>: It's pretty clear what pattern is being matched with K. It's very rust, like.

12:42:42
<transcript>: okay

12:42:43
heroictashcan: Good day!

12:42:58
<transcript>: Okay, fine. We're going back to the case statement. I knew there had to be a reason, like, it had to be like, kind of like when python developers are like, that's not a very pythonic way to do it. I knew there had to be something with case statements in Elixirland, where people were, like, obsessed with them because everything.

12:42:58
<transcript>: in this entire

12:43:03
<transcript>: In this entire repo is a case statement. Good day, heroic. Good day.

12:43:04
thdxr: I never use else in any language but specifically in elixir you pretty much always use case

12:43:04
nexxeln: https://twitter.com/nexxeln/status/1645769177746264064

12:43:11
<transcript>: Okay, so we've made it more elixir ONYC or whatever the equivalent of pythonic is.

12:43:22
kaznia: with statements are the most holy thing I've seen in my life

12:43:29
wesleycoder: "Pythonic way" gives me chills

12:43:29
<transcript>: Next is doing a great job of queuing up some Tweets for Twitter time. I would like to encourage other people to also queue up tweets for Twitter time. Paste your Tweet links into my chat and I'll look at them in a little bit. It'll just pull them up in my browser with statements are the most Holy thing I've seen in my life.

12:43:29
<transcript>: with state

12:43:31
<transcript>: With statements.

12:43:34
<transcript>: Kaznia welcome to chat.

12:43:35
thdxr: I gotta think of a tweet to post

12:43:37
<transcript>: What are with statements.

12:43:42
wesleycoder: Had bad experiences with that saying

12:43:45
thdxr: with in elixir is real good

12:43:45
<transcript>: Pythonic Way gives me chills. You got to think of a post. Tweet the post. Hey, dax, I. Tweeted. This morning.

12:43:45
<transcript>: i did it on

12:43:47
heroictashcan: laughs in c++ :)

12:43:51
<transcript>: I did it on stream. People helped me tweet it. Do you hate this tweet? Dax, tell me what you think of this tweet.

12:43:53
nihil2501: with statements are monads

12:43:57
<transcript>: I need you to give me real time feedback. Just give it to me right now.

12:44:02
<transcript>: With an elixir is real good. Okay. There's a tweet just tweet that.

12:44:07
<transcript>: Or you meant you got to think of a tweet to post in my chat.

12:44:10
ferellon: I've never worked with Elixir before. What makes it good for your use case?

12:44:15
<transcript>: Is that what you meant with statements? Are monads. There's two things I don't know about.

12:44:27
<transcript>: Farrellon, welcome to Chat. I've never worked with elixir before. What makes it good for your use case? So, Ferrellon, we built this app six, seven years ago. This version of it in elixir because.

12:44:27
<transcript>: the main

12:44:31
thdxr: LOL

12:44:33
<transcript>: The main developer leading the effort loved Elixir. So that's why we use elixir.

12:44:34
thdxr: nice tweet

12:44:35
<transcript>: The pros and cons.

12:44:35
<transcript>: of el

12:44:37
<transcript>: Of elixir.

12:44:37
<transcript>: it's very good

12:44:42
<transcript>: It's very good with concurrency and fault tolerance and something else that Chat gbz told us.

12:44:46
itsmeleague: Elixir is great

12:44:53
<transcript>: It's bad because not a lot of people know it. It's not bad. It's just like there's fewer people that you can hire that are like, I will take over your elixir code base and do a great job.

12:44:59
nexxeln: no types as well

12:45:08
<transcript>: You like it, dax, you like the tweet. Okay. We spent a lot of time writing this tweet. I think it was a good ten minutes on stream. People helped me. I was trying to come up with the analogy. They helped me come up with the analogy. And then it was all about wording. It just right.

12:45:13
<transcript>: So anyway, we're going to do Twitter time here in a minute. People send me your tweets.

12:45:13
<transcript>: okay

12:45:15
<transcript>: Okay.

12:45:15
<transcript>: so i need

12:45:23
nihil2501: elixir has tiny adoption. I see what few projects exist getting rewritten because no one knows elixir

12:45:23
<transcript>: So I need to do some with statements. Apparently. Let's see how many with statements there are in here. I think the person who wrote most of this name is Sean. Great guy.

12:45:23
<transcript>: he didn't

12:45:25
ferellon: Cool. Ty SeemsGood

12:45:26
julianfbeck: :w

12:45:27
<transcript>: He didn't seem pretty good at elixir. I think he's a pretty good elixir. Dev.

12:45:31
nihil2501: Sadge

12:45:34
<transcript>: Where is a with statement? I want to see one now. I want to see it.

12:45:34
<transcript>: want to

12:45:39
thdxr: I'll be the judge of that

12:45:54
<transcript>: Want to see it licks her has tiny adoption. Oh, yeah. No types. Great. Call that's another Con. No types. Tiny adoption. I see what few projects exist. Getting rewritten because no one knows elixir. I mean, honestly, nihil, that's why we're rewriting it. Because no one knows elixir. So we're using astro. Here we go. Nope. Still not a with statement.

12:45:57
darrenbaldwin03: Sick tweet considering a tweet I just tweeted: https://twitter.com/DarrenBaldwin03/status/1645504740040798208

12:46:03
<transcript>: Why am I just doing this? Why am I just hitting the up key over and over? Can I do page up? No.

12:46:06
<transcript>: There's some feedback for Ted. Why can't I page up in here.

12:46:17
thdxr: control+u

12:46:20
<transcript>: Darren sick tweet considering a tweet. I just tweeted there. And we will look at that during Twitter time, because it will. Okay, whatever. There's no with statements in here, you'll be the judge of that judge of what.

12:46:25
<transcript>: Oh, you'll be the judge of no, I don't know what you'll be the judge of control U.

12:46:25
<transcript>: yeah

12:46:29
<transcript>: Yeah, no, that's page up, but I couldn't do it inside of.

12:46:29
<transcript>: here

12:46:31
<transcript>: Here.

12:46:34
<transcript>: Control. U wasn't doing anything in here.

12:46:34
<transcript>: i can only

12:46:36
<transcript>: I can only one up and down.

12:46:36
<transcript>: i don't know

12:46:40
thdxr: oh weird

12:46:41
<transcript>: I don't know. Is that a telescope thing? Do I just not have the key? Binds.

12:46:45
thdxr: thought it worked

12:46:45
laytanl_: You need to get out of insert mode

12:46:48
<transcript>: Oh, weird. Does it work for you bummer? So let's go. Here.

12:46:48
<transcript>: so here's what we're saying

12:46:54
<transcript>: So here's what we're saying. We're saying if they've hit their limit, their free tier limit, if you will.

12:46:59
<transcript>: Then the can query will be false and we redirect them to the upgrade page.

12:47:01
<transcript>: Pro.

12:47:01
<transcript>: otherwise

12:47:08
<transcript>: Otherwise we carry on with the query. But this I don't understand why this.

12:47:21
<transcript>: Is not why this is not counting it as true. Like Cam query can return true or false. Is that not the case? Somebody who's smart with elixir. Tell me.

12:47:22
ferellon: i cant ctr+u or ctrl+d in telescope either

12:47:26
<transcript>: Can query if one of the conditions here is its count is less than five.

12:47:29
<transcript>: Then what's the deal.

12:47:29
<transcript>: thought it

12:47:34
<transcript>: Thought it worked. Oh, you need to get out of insert mode. Thank you, Lightning. So if I say test.

12:47:41
<transcript>: I'm like doing this, but I get out of insert mode. Nope. Didn't work for me.

12:47:41
<transcript>: it may just

12:47:55
<transcript>: It may just be my key binds. So elixir's people, listen, I got a problem. I think this should be the same as true countless than five. Sometimes that could be true if that's true.

12:47:55
<transcript>: wait

12:47:57
<transcript>: Wait is count.

12:47:57
<transcript>: what is count

12:47:58
<transcript>: What is count.

12:47:59
laytanl_: Huh I am able to do it

12:48:03
<transcript>: Let's just see what happens now.

12:48:03
<transcript>: you're able to do

12:48:06
<transcript>: You're able to do it. Okay. It's my key. Binds.

12:48:06
<transcript>: let's see

12:48:08
<transcript>: Let's see here.

12:48:11
wesleycoder: Works in vscode LUL

12:48:12
<transcript>: I'm going to watch the logs, and I'm going to hit this again.

12:48:14
aaaaliou: can you display the log to know the value of count?

12:48:15
<transcript>: Most points in a game.

12:48:20
<transcript>: Works in vs. Code.

12:48:23
<transcript>: Can you display the log to know the value? Yeah, that's what we're going to do right now.

12:48:26
<transcript>: Did it, log it.

12:48:35
<transcript>: Did it log it did it log it did it log it.

12:48:38
<transcript>: Actually, I just realized.

12:48:38
<transcript>: i'm not logged

12:48:44
<transcript>: I'm not logged in now, so that won't run. It's just going to run false. So I got to log in. Hang on.

12:48:47
<transcript>: Off sign in.

12:48:47
<transcript>: email

12:48:49
<transcript>: Email.

12:48:57
<transcript>: Okay.

12:49:02
<transcript>: Let's log in again.

12:49:09
<transcript>: Now we're logged in to set muse.

12:49:13
<transcript>: Now let's try it most points.

12:49:13
<transcript>: in

12:49:15
<transcript>: In a game.

12:49:20
<transcript>: What was the value of.

12:49:20
<transcript>: count

12:49:21
<transcript>: Count.

12:49:23
<transcript>: I don't see.

12:49:26
<transcript>: The value of count.

12:49:31
<transcript>: Did I log it, or did I fail to log it? Cast error.

12:49:33
<transcript>: Oh.

12:49:33
<transcript>: a

12:49:37
<transcript>: A cast error. So there's a query cast error.

12:49:37
<transcript>: oh interesting

12:49:44
<transcript>: Oh, interesting. This is new. Okay. So it didn't make it to that line because there's an error on.

12:49:47
<transcript>: Get user ask count.

12:49:47
<transcript>: so go

12:49:50
<transcript>: So go to definition. Here we go.

12:49:54
<transcript>: There's an error. I'm casting something wrong.

12:49:54
<transcript>: so i think

12:49:56
<transcript>: So I think it's this is it this.

12:50:01
<transcript>: I did that date thing I shouldn't have. That was a mistake.

12:50:06
<transcript>: Now I'm waiting for the thing to tell me it's wrong Yeah.

12:50:15
<transcript>: So I can't use beginning of month, not a Valley query expression. If you want to invoke in a query, make sure the module date is required and that it's a macro.

12:50:18
<transcript>: Can I just do like a variable.

12:50:21
<transcript>: Can I just say.

12:50:21
<transcript>: like

12:50:22
<transcript>: Like.

12:50:22
<transcript>: first

12:50:25
<transcript>: First day of month.

12:50:25
<transcript>: equ

12:50:27
<transcript>: Equals.

12:50:34
<transcript>: This.

12:50:37
<transcript>: I just do this and then.

12:50:39
<transcript>: First.

12:50:44
<transcript>: Day of month.

12:50:44
<transcript>: does that work

12:50:45
<transcript>: Does that work.

12:50:50
<transcript>: Wait for the very slow thing. Unbound. Very.

12:50:55
<transcript>: Like this.

12:50:59
<transcript>: That work.

12:51:00
stephencodes: You need to pin the variable.

12:51:18
stephencodes: Yes.

12:51:19
<transcript>: You need to pin the variable. Is that what I just did, Stephen? Welcome to chat. Is that what I just did with the little up carrot I pinned it. Welcome to my chat, Stephen codes. Thank you for the tip. I love it when twitch chat teaches me things, which is constantly. I don't know why I made that a song.

12:51:20
thdxr: I actually never used ecto despite using elixir for 5 years

12:51:23
<transcript>: My trackpad is dying.

12:51:25
<transcript>: Oh.

12:51:33
<transcript>: You never used ecto. Interesting. What's the alternative writing SQL queries or something. I've got to get a chord.

12:51:35
<transcript>: From my thing.

12:51:35
<transcript>: hang on

12:51:37
<transcript>: Hang on.

12:51:38
thdxr: didn't use sql

12:51:43
stephencodes: @thxdr How?

12:51:46
thdxr: I used LMDB lol

12:51:52
<transcript>: Lmdb? What is that.

12:51:52
<transcript>: what

12:51:55
<transcript>: What is? Lmdb.

12:52:00
nexxeln: i joined the elixir discord and by mistake said "ecto is the orm right" and 2 people roasted me instantly

12:52:01
<transcript>: Okay.

12:52:03
<transcript>: Most points.

12:52:05
itsmeleague: Ligma db

12:52:06
<transcript>: In a game.

12:52:07
nihil2501: elixir people are constantly raving how great ecto is

12:52:09
<transcript>: See if I've done more than five queries.

12:52:11
thdxr: it's a low level embedded key value store, super fast

12:52:14
<transcript>: Ligma DB that's a good one.

12:52:14
<transcript>: i joined

12:52:20
<transcript>: I joined the election discord and by mistakes that ecto is the orm right and two people roasted me instantly.

12:52:23
<transcript>: Do they have a problem with calling it an orm kind of like.

12:52:23
<transcript>: the prism

12:52:25
<transcript>: The prisma people.

12:52:44
nexxeln: orm is for oop langs

12:52:45
<transcript>: Are they roasted you? Because you didn't know for sure. Is that what you're saying next? Or do they not like calling it an or M? I think it's so funny when people get upset about like names. It's a low level embedded key value store super fast. That sounds like a dax thing. Sounds like something you would use.

12:52:45
<transcript>: lm

12:52:47
<transcript>: Lmdb.

12:52:49
nexxeln: objects don't exist in elixir

12:52:53
<transcript>: Orm is for oop length. Oh, okay, so.

12:52:53
<transcript>: it can't be

12:53:03
<transcript>: It can't be an orm if there's no objects in elixir. Interesting. That's a good point. Okay, I got you. So, did we log the thing.

12:53:03
<transcript>: do we

12:53:03
thdxr: "people get upset about names" ok I'm going to call you Jessica

12:53:08
<transcript>: Do we log it or no, we still got a cast error. Still a cast error? Is that what happened.

12:53:09
nexxeln: LUL

12:53:13
<transcript>: Query source asks here's the query.

12:53:18
nexxeln: Mada

12:53:18
<transcript>: No, that's the quick wait. Did it work.

12:53:23
<transcript>: I don't see a cast error now query. Okay.

12:53:23
<transcript>: let's go

12:53:26
<transcript>: Let's go back here. Let's see.

12:53:29
nexxeln: dax = xad

12:53:31
<transcript>: In a season.

12:53:33
thdxr: chad

12:53:38
<transcript>: Is there a cast error? Converted air. Yeah. Okay.

12:53:44
<transcript>: So we're not able to perform that query. I'm still doing something wrong.

12:53:49
<transcript>: Can somebody help me? What am I doing wrong.

12:53:49
<transcript>: here's the

12:53:53
<transcript>: Here's the query. We got a table. We're saying by user.

12:54:00
<transcript>: We're last asked at is greater than or equal to first day of the month. Can I do it like that first day of the month.

12:54:07
<transcript>: And then repo. Aggregate. Maybe instead of aggregate. Oh, enumap. What is this.

12:54:07
<transcript>: i don't want

12:54:10
<transcript>: I don't want to do that. What is that.

12:54:15
<transcript>: What? Maybe that's the problem.

12:54:15
<transcript>: no

12:54:17
<transcript>: No, that's.

12:54:17
<transcript>: after the

12:54:20
<transcript>: After the query right.

12:54:26
<transcript>: I don't know what happens if I delete that. I just want the actual count. What is this? Return.

12:54:34
<transcript>: What does it return? I know there's no type. So what is it returned.

12:54:34
<transcript>: am i now

12:54:38
<transcript>: Am I now I just want the actual count.

12:54:40
<transcript>: Add.

12:54:44
<transcript>: You're going to call me Jessica.

12:54:49
<transcript>: Mata. That's funny. What do we think? Did that work.

12:54:52
<transcript>: Try it.

12:54:55
<transcript>: Both points in a game.

12:54:59
<transcript>: Just trying to get to the point where we can run a query.

12:55:01
stephencodes: That should return the count, IIRC.

12:55:02
<transcript>: This query is still not good, is it.

12:55:06
<transcript>: No, it's not. What's wrong with this.

12:55:06
<transcript>: asks

12:55:16
<transcript>: Asks by user where and then aggregate. Maybe instead of aggregate I should just do repo all and just see if that's the issue. Repo all.

12:55:19
<transcript>: Maybe that's the issue.

12:55:22
<transcript>: Last asked at.

12:55:30
<transcript>: I o put first day of month.

12:55:30
<transcript>: i probably

12:55:34
<transcript>: I probably have a logger in here. Logger.

12:55:38
<transcript>: That.

12:55:46
<transcript>: Okay. So we're going to see what that looks like.

12:55:46
stephencodes: Have you tried it in iex or LiveBook? Might be easier to debug.

12:55:49
<transcript>: First.

12:55:49
<transcript>: day

12:55:51
<transcript>: Day of month.

12:55:51
<transcript>: no

12:55:53
<transcript>: No.

12:55:53
<transcript>: most points

12:55:55
<transcript>: Most points in a game.

12:55:59
<transcript>: Oh.

12:56:03
<transcript>: Logger is not imported.

12:56:08
<transcript>: This is going well, this is going well.

12:56:11
<transcript>: Choir, logger.

12:56:15
thdxr: I always hated that Logger was a macro

12:56:17
<transcript>: How about that now.

12:56:21
thdxr: and you needed to require it

12:56:21
<transcript>: Does that work.

12:56:25
<transcript>: I hate that it's a macro too.

12:56:27
<transcript>: I hate that.

12:56:29
<transcript>: Oh, Wait, what's? This.

12:56:29
<transcript>: did you say that

12:56:33
<transcript>: Did you say that I was missing? What did you say.

12:56:37
<transcript>: Not required date or something let's find out.

12:56:37
<transcript>: i don't even

12:56:41
<transcript>: I don't even know what a macro is. Zacks, if I'm being honest.

12:56:41
<transcript>: i just

12:56:46
thdxr: what a weird stream we're all talking about elixir stuff

12:56:46
<transcript>: I just was being dumb when I was like, I hate that the macro too. Most points in a game.

12:56:54
thdxr: elixir macros are amazing

12:56:56
<transcript>: Oh, what do we get? Did it do it.

12:56:58
thdxr: miss them in js

12:57:04
itsmeleague: Man the slow updates of hints is painful

12:57:04
<transcript>: So much going on get time zone name.

12:57:06
nexxeln: are they like macros in rust?

12:57:08
thdxr: it's basically a codegen framework built into the language

12:57:14
<transcript>: I don't see. Oh, first day of month. Here we go. Yes, four. One. That's good. That's good.

12:57:14
<transcript>: still

12:57:19
<transcript>: Still have a cast error? What is my cast error.

12:57:19
<transcript>: where am i casting something

12:57:21
<transcript>: Where am I casting something that I can't cast.

12:57:31
nexxeln: @thdxr oh like ocaml ppx

12:57:31
<transcript>: Elixir macros are amazing. Miss them in js. What a weird stream. We're all talking about elixir stuff. Seriously, this is the first for an Adam stream.

12:57:36
<transcript>: Twitch pots thank you for the follow. Appreciate your follow.

12:57:41
thdxr: they're not like macros in rust because people actually build useful stuff with elixir

12:57:50
<transcript>: Are they like macros and rust. Oh, like O camel. You guys are so smart. The slow updates of hints is so painful, but it's me League. I don't know if that's actually an elixir problem I was showing a second ago. This is a giant repo.

12:57:50
<transcript>: there

12:57:51
aaaaliou: it might be the first_day_of_month variable?

12:57:55
nexxeln: shots fired

12:57:57
<transcript>: There's a lot of elixir in here. I don't know if you see all that. That's insane. And that's not even all of it.

12:57:57
<transcript>: that's just like

12:58:02
<transcript>: That's just like the bits that I've got expanded. Look at this.

12:58:07
<transcript>: This is like an insane amount of elixir.

12:58:07
<transcript>: it's a lot

12:58:09
<transcript>: It's a lot.

12:58:14
<transcript>: The Astro side that we're rewriting all this to is not this big.

12:58:17
<transcript>: How it got so giant.

12:58:19
<transcript>: Anyway.

12:58:19
<transcript>: it's probably

12:58:24
<transcript>: It's probably going to be like one of those. We don't need these screws.

12:58:31
<transcript>: Putting something together after the rewrite, I'm going to be like, look, didn't need any of that stuff. Turns out.

12:58:31
<transcript>: did

12:58:32
dnbull: morning, Adam!

12:58:32
<transcript>: Did.

12:58:32
<transcript>: they're not

12:58:36
<transcript>: They're not like macros and rust because people actually build useful stuff with.

12:58:36
<transcript>: blu

12:58:37
<transcript>: Blu.

12:58:39
wesleycoder: What does that ^ does?

12:58:43
<transcript>: Might be the first day of the month variable is that the thing that's not casted correctly.

12:58:54
<transcript>: What if I did just a constant variable of constant value here? But if I said date last ask is greater than or equal to.

12:58:57
<transcript>: Is this a string.

12:58:57
<transcript>: is

12:58:58
meranofox: how do you toggle you terminal in and out of vim?

12:58:59
<transcript>: Is last asked.

12:59:02
<transcript>: At.

12:59:04
<transcript>: Sorry to say.

12:59:04
<transcript>: let's see if i can

12:59:07
<transcript>: Let's see if I can find somewhere else where we're doing a query.

12:59:11
<transcript>: Like a filter last.

12:59:11
<transcript>: at

12:59:13
<transcript>: At.

12:59:17
meranofox: I thought that generally wasn't persistent, you start clean

12:59:25
<transcript>: C anywhere where we're doing a comparison.

12:59:32
<transcript>: That's mine. The one I did.

12:59:35
<transcript>: Maybe I just doing it wrong.

12:59:35
<transcript>: but

12:59:40
<transcript>: But it generally wasn't persistent. You circle. How do you toggle your terminal in and out of them.

12:59:42
aaaaliou: I think ecto requires a naive datetime or a Ecto.Datetime type instead of a Datetime type

12:59:43
<transcript>: Oh Murano I'm using.

12:59:43
<transcript>: tm

12:59:45
<transcript>: Tmux.

12:59:48
<transcript>: I'm using T mux.

12:59:48
<transcript>: let's

12:59:50
<transcript>: Let's see if we can do.

12:59:52
<transcript>: Inserted.

12:59:55
stephencodes: Are you comparing a Date with a DateTime?

12:59:55
aaaaliou: I might be wrong, I haven't done elixir in years

12:59:55
<transcript>: At greater than oh, look at that.

12:59:55
<transcript>: look at

12:59:58
<transcript>: Look at that. Here we go.

13:00:00
<transcript>: Since.

13:00:06
<transcript>: This is a string. Oh, it's a string. Is that the problem? It's a string.

13:00:14
<transcript>: It needs to just be a string. Is that the problem? What's type? Do.

13:00:14
<transcript>: what's this

13:00:16
<transcript>: What's this do.

13:00:19
<transcript>: Is this what I need to do.

13:00:22
<transcript>: I'm comparing date with the date time. I think I'm comparing.

13:00:22
<transcript>: yeah

13:00:26
<transcript>: Yeah, it's a date time and I'm comparing date, yeah, but it's a string, I think.

13:00:33
<transcript>: So how do I do that? I'm comparing a date to a date time string.

13:00:39
<transcript>: Ector requires a naive date time or an ecto date time type instead of a date time type. Okay, so that's a problem.

13:00:42
<transcript>: Okay. So like this right here.

13:00:45
thdxr: ask chat gpt

13:00:47
<transcript>: Mutc date time. Use X. That's what I need to do.

13:00:51
thdxr: how to write this auieryt

13:00:52
<transcript>: Probably ask Chad gbt maybe.

13:00:57
<transcript>: Ted dbt how do I.

13:01:00
<transcript>: Using elixir.

13:01:01
thdxr: query

13:01:04
<transcript>: And ecto, and I need to compare.

13:01:07
<transcript>: A string.

13:01:10
<transcript>: A column to.

13:01:10
<transcript>: a date

13:01:11
<transcript>: A date.

13:01:22
<transcript>: String column to date can be done by converting the string to a date before performing the comparison. No, I think.

13:01:26
<transcript>: I need to convert the date to a string, right.

13:01:29
thdxr: ask a less specific question, as how to get first day of month

13:01:32
jokestera_e: Hello everyine

13:01:43
<transcript>: Ask a less specific question, how to get the first day of month. I already got that. Dax already got the first day of the month. It showed me how to do that with the built in.

13:01:47
<transcript>: Hello, jokester.

13:01:52
<transcript>: Stephen coates. Thank you for the follow. Thank you so much.

13:01:55
<transcript>: Event date string.

13:01:57
<transcript>: Let's do this.

13:01:59
thdxr: I meant ask how to do an ecto query to get rows from first day of month

13:02:02
<transcript>: Last asked.

13:02:07
<transcript>: I want to find.

13:02:10
<transcript>: The actual schema.

13:02:14
<transcript>: Ema.

13:02:20
<transcript>: Field last asked at is utc Date time usec.

13:02:20
<transcript>: okay so

13:02:22
<transcript>: Okay. So here's what I'm going to do.

13:02:24
<transcript>: I'm going to do this.

13:02:29
<transcript>: Like this.

13:02:34
<transcript>: Option no.

13:02:42
<transcript>: Yeah.

13:02:45
<transcript>: So type.

13:02:49
<transcript>: Date.

13:02:51
<transcript>: What was it.

13:02:55
<transcript>: Utc daytime usec.

13:03:00
<transcript>: Utc Date Time use.

13:03:02
<transcript>: That.

13:03:06
<transcript>: No.

13:03:12
<transcript>: Cannot use outside of mash clauses.

13:03:13
thdxr: from(MyApp.MySchema) |> where([row], row.inserted_at >= ^DateTime.utc_now().beginning_of_month()) |> count() |> Repo.one()

13:03:18
<transcript>: Should I.

13:03:19
thdxr: chat gpt just gave me this

13:03:21
<transcript>: What are you doing.

13:03:21
<transcript>: count

13:03:22
<transcript>: Count is a thing.

13:03:22
<transcript>: are you

13:03:24
<transcript>: Are you serious.

13:03:24
thdxr: is it right

13:03:27
<transcript>: Are you kidding me right now.

13:03:34
<transcript>: Dax, that looks amazing. That looks exactly what I need. So let's do it. Let's just copy that.

13:03:34
<transcript>: is right

13:03:40
<transcript>: Is right. Okay. I should have just been smart from the beginning. So here we go.

13:03:42
<transcript>: Delete all that.

13:03:42
<transcript>: asks

13:03:46
<transcript>: Asks users by user and then we need to do.

13:03:49
aaaaliou: you need to remove the ^

13:03:50
<transcript>: Where I'm just going to convert this.

13:03:59
<transcript>: The where row row inserted at is greater than or equal to and then just do this.

13:03:59
<transcript>: date

13:04:02
<transcript>: Date Time utc now.

13:04:06
<transcript>: Beginning.

13:04:08
<transcript>: Of month.

13:04:12
<transcript>: Same like that.

13:04:15
<transcript>: And then.

13:04:18
<transcript>: Count.

13:04:20
<transcript>: And then.

13:04:20
<transcript>: repo

13:04:21
<transcript>: Repo.

13:04:21
<transcript>: one

13:04:23
<transcript>: One.

13:04:27
thdxr: count is from Ecto.Query

13:04:28
<transcript>: The only problem here is.

13:04:33
thdxr: not sure if you imported that

13:04:34
<transcript>: I don't think this is the right type count is from ecto query.

13:04:42
<transcript>: This.

13:04:44
thdxr: Ecto.Query.count

13:04:46
<transcript>: We've got Echo query. Where? Right here, right.

13:04:52
<transcript>: Oh, do I not need the friends.

13:05:02
<transcript>: Do I actually need to do something up here? Do I need to import something? No.

13:05:07
thdxr: oh maybe ecto.query.count isn't a thing lmao

13:05:10
thdxr: chat gipity

13:05:14
<transcript>: So the only thing is I don't think the tight I don't think last ask at is the right type to do this comparison. I still think I need to do type.

13:05:17
<transcript>: And then UTC.

13:05:20
<transcript>: Date time use.

13:05:22
<transcript>: I need to do that.

13:05:23
dnbull: chatGPT out here guessing Kappa

13:05:25
<transcript>: Oh, Hello.

13:05:29
<transcript>: Chat jippity.

13:05:31
<transcript>: Maybe that's not a thing.

13:05:33
thdxr: wait what type is the column

13:05:39
<transcript>: Did we get a hallucination here? What type is the column? It's a string. Dax, I think.

13:05:44
<transcript>: This is how it's being compared to other places.

13:05:45
traylortrash84: Good morning.

13:05:48

13:06:07
<transcript>: the time of the

13:06:12
jokestera_e: OOO Dax on the spot lol

13:06:16
<transcript>: The time of the column is we're going to go with the string. This is how it's been compared in other places. So I think it's a string. I don't know. It's a utc daytime usec.

13:06:16
<transcript>: all right

13:06:18
<transcript>: All right, I'll be back.

<transcript>: Moderator position on the line. That's right. Dax, did you come up with the answer? Here we go. Module.

13:11:40

13:11:45
<transcript>: Select.

13:11:48
<transcript>: S count okay.

13:11:48
<transcript>: so

13:11:52
<transcript>: So the select same it seems good. What did you do there with first day of the month.

13:11:52
<transcript>: are you just like

13:11:55
<transcript>: Are you just like leaving it? How it is. Is that what that means.

13:12:00

13:12:01
jokestera_e: I hope that works we rooting for Dax to keep his job

13:12:05
<transcript>: I'm hungry. So we're just going to go and do this.

13:12:12
<transcript>: Hope it works. Dax pressure is on.

13:12:19
<transcript>: Sometimes I wonder if I have too many moderators.

13:12:21
wesleycoder: adamdevAdambar

13:12:28
<transcript>: Like I basically just made everybody a moderator at one point. And maybe you should all be like, vips. But I should only have a few moderators. I don't know.

13:12:29
thdxr: who's getting demoted?

13:12:30
<transcript>: Don't know.

13:12:32

<transcript>: Who's getting demoted? I don't know.

13:12:41

13:12:42
<transcript>: I should have a competition. Who's my best moderator.

13:12:46
<transcript>: Let's vote. That's a good idea.

13:12:53
<transcript>: It's kind of a shame that Dean Bull is not a moderator when he's my favorite Miami.

13:12:56
<transcript>: And dax is a moderator.

13:12:56
<transcript>: is my second

13:12:57
pbertrand_dev: How much do you pay your mods?

13:13:02
<transcript>: Is my second favorite. Miami actually loses my second favorite. Miami dax is my third.

13:13:02
<transcript>: how much do you

13:13:02
dnbull: hahahaha

13:13:04
<transcript>: How much do you pay your mods.

13:13:22

<transcript>: What's the time for me? 08:14 a.m.

13:14:21

13:15:25
<transcript>: i love

13:15:32
<transcript>: I love that idea. I would need to maybe figure out if I have too many mods. It'd be like everybody's getting like a dollar 50.

13:16:08
jokestera_e: Adam just curious what takes have you heard on twitter that's got you bringing out your takes?

13:16:12
<transcript>: There's some more. It opened one in one browser and the others in the other.

13:16:12
<transcript>: why did

13:16:14
<transcript>: Why did it do that.

13:16:16
<transcript>: That's annoying.

13:16:16

13:16:33

13:16:38
<transcript>: The language that must not be named. Why are they doing that? It just seems crazy.

13:16:43
<transcript>: You got that Adam is really hating versailles at the moment.

13:16:55
<transcript>: Well, you guys all sent a lot of messages all at once. He didn't respond on slack yesterday, and Liz didn't realize it was a holiday and was worried he died.

13:16:57

13:17:02

13:17:24
<transcript>: It's cut off. What does it say? Really hating versailles. Oh, no, that's got you.

13:17:24
<transcript>: bringing out

13:17:25
<transcript>: Bringing out your takes.

13:17:30
thdxr: rant rant rant

13:17:31
<transcript>: It's not about one specific take it's just the overall temperature.

13:17:31
<transcript>: of

13:17:33
<transcript>: Of Web, dev, Twitter.

13:17:33
<transcript>: and

13:17:36
<transcript>: And YouTube. It's the temperature of.

13:17:44
<transcript>: Like it's the coddling. And I'm not the only person who's called this out, but like treating people like they're not smart enough to learn something.

13:17:52
<transcript>: And I get it like there are abstractions that we should build on top of, and we don't need to learn like, you don't need to go out and learn assembly probably.

13:17:52
<transcript>: you might

13:17:55
<transcript>: You might maybe you want to maybe you'd enjoy that.

13:17:55
<transcript>: but

13:18:09
<transcript>: But the current web Dev environment is so like everyone's delicate and no one can learn anything and you just need a nice Dev experience so you can build something. Even you can build something because versailles exists and you don't need Versaille to build something.

13:18:09
<transcript>: it's

13:18:23
<transcript>: It's great to use, but I like to use versaille, knowing I could also do other things and build things with my own technologies or with lower level primitives. I don't know that's what's bothering me. It's not one take or any person making takes.

13:18:23
<transcript>: it's just i

13:18:27
<transcript>: It's just I look around and I'm like, Why is everything so.

13:18:27
<transcript>: like

13:18:29
keksdose4011: @nexxeln is for LUA right ?

13:18:33
jokestera_e: I understand that.

13:18:40
<transcript>: Like for one, why is everybody so obsessed with versailles, and it's enabling all this startup creation or something. It's not. I don't know any startups that are thriving because versailles exists. I know a lot of startups that are built on top of AWS.

13:18:40
<transcript>: and

13:18:41
nexxeln: no its for everything, its configured in lua @keksdose4011

13:18:42
<transcript>: And I don't know.

13:18:42
<transcript>: it's just this

13:18:46
<transcript>: It's just this vibe. I'm just tired of it. And I realize.

13:18:46
<transcript>: it's not that

13:18:49
thdxr: I know one startup that's struggling because of vercel lol

13:18:53
<transcript>: It's not that the takes drove me to this. It's that I woke up in realized I actually have opinions on this stuff, and I don't know why I don't share them.

13:18:53
<transcript>: i

13:18:57
<transcript>: I think I just didn't feel like I had anything to offer.

13:19:02
ghostyx101: next its just for shill and hype i really dont gewt it either

13:19:02
<transcript>: I don't know enough to feel like my opinions matter, but I think I do.

13:19:02
<transcript>: and

13:19:05
<transcript>: And I'm going to start saying them, that's all.

13:19:05
<transcript>: rant

13:19:09
<transcript>: Rant, rant, rant. No, we're doing Twitter time. That's what we're doing.

13:19:13

13:19:33
<transcript>: It's configured in lua. I know one startup is struggling because of her cell. Yeah, exactly. Same.

13:19:33
<transcript>: next

13:19:35
dnbull: I wish I had an opinion but I only create small apps with vercel/next so I don't know much about the issues with startups :(

13:19:36

13:19:42
<transcript>: If Adam doesn't know enough, I'm screwed.

13:19:42
<transcript>: that's

13:19:45
<transcript>: That's not true. Twitter needs more opinions. Just got back.

13:19:45
<transcript>: i think that was

13:20:00
<transcript>: I think that was a joke. Perch doesn't need more opinions, does it? Or maybe it does. I do feel like it's out of balance. I feel like the voices that are the loudest are all kind of saying some of the same things, and it's starting to just grade on me a little bit.

13:20:03
<transcript>: Lukey, thank you for the follow.

13:20:11
<transcript>: Next is great, but I wouldn't host with Versailles.

13:20:15
ferellon: @darrenbaldwin03 This. I really like it for my side projects but probably wouldn't run a real business on it

13:20:30
<transcript>: I wish I had an opinion, but I only create small apps with versaille next, so I don't know much about the issues with startups. Yeah. And that's the thing. Versailles. It's great if you're staying in the free tier and you're building something really simple. I have lots of things deployed to versailles, and I don't plan to move them off of it because they're not things that are going to grow to a point that it matters.

13:20:37
<transcript>: So that's totally valid. I swear versaille has more side projects deployed on their infrared than actual companies. Oh, for sure.

13:20:46
darrenbaldwin03: ^

13:20:47
<transcript>: You start at 06:00. A.m.. I did trav. I started earlier today. I actually started working at 330 this morning. I could not sleep. I'm so excited. All of a sudden, I have purpose.

13:20:47
<transcript>: i have

13:20:50
nefine_: Is vercel the new Heroky

13:20:54
nefine_: Heroku*

13:20:55
<transcript>: I have, like, a long term goal. Do you remember yesterday I said, I don't have any long term goals. I set short term goals, like, I want to be a twitch partner, and then I get it. And I'm like.

13:20:55
<transcript>: now i don't have any goals

13:20:57
<transcript>: Now I don't have any goals.

13:20:57
<transcript>: well

13:21:05
julianfbeck: whats your purpose?

13:21:05
techsavvytravvy: lol

13:21:05
<transcript>: Well, I got goals now. My goals are to make a dent in the web Dev narrative. I want to I want to put my thoughts out there, and I.

13:21:07
dnbull: I like how you mentioned your bill with statmuse is about 2500/m but with vercel it would be 12k/m that's nuts.

13:21:11
<transcript>: Want to share what I build with and what I think are good alternatives to some of these things that are so simple.

13:21:13
<transcript>: Like SST.

13:21:15
<transcript>: Okay.

13:21:21
andreaslorozco: !sst

13:21:21
fossabot: SST is the best way to create modern applications on AWS, and Dax (@thdxr) is a co-founder there. https://sst.dev

13:21:21
<transcript>: There you go. Tweet for you. Thank you, dax. I'm going to read it here in just a second.

13:21:21
<transcript>: i really like

13:21:26
<transcript>: I really like it for my side projects but probably wouldn't run a real business on it.

13:21:26
<transcript>: yes

13:21:32
<transcript>: Yes. Versailles, the new heroku. Yeah. Maybe they might also run into similar issues.

13:21:32
<transcript>: on monet

13:21:35
<transcript>: On monetization and such.

13:21:35
<transcript>: what

13:21:41
<transcript>: What's your purpose? Oh, my purpose, Julian, is to just share my experiences. I think.

13:21:41
<transcript>: i think

13:21:46
<transcript>: I think they're valid. And I think the web Dev community has swung really hard one way.

13:21:51
dnbull: So if you all were building "real" apps I guess, what would would you all be using?

13:21:52
<transcript>: And I'd like to help bring some balance to that. That's my new purpose.

13:21:55
<transcript>: And when I set my mind to something.

13:21:55
<transcript>: i get ob

13:22:01
dnbull: im assuming thats going to be a "it depends" cliche lol

13:22:05
<transcript>: I get obsessed and I do stuff. I don't know if this is Crystal enough. Crystal clear enough for me to get my whole focus beam on it.

13:22:06
coolpantstv: @adamdotdev wants to bring balance to the force

13:22:07
<transcript>: But if I do.

13:22:07
<transcript>: i will

13:22:09
<transcript>: I will reach my goals.

13:22:09
<transcript>: i've never set

13:22:17
<transcript>: I've never set a goal I didn't meet. You know what I mean? Maybe I don't set enough goals. That's probably the problem, but I go pretty hard in the paint. You know what I'm saying.

13:22:21
<transcript>: I don't know what I'm saying, so you probably don't.

13:22:30
dnbull: is SST a good point to get your feet wet with AWS?

13:22:30
<transcript>: I like how you mentioned your bill with stat muse is about 2500 a month, but with versailles, it would be 12,000. That's just bandwidth. The in Bull. That's a small line item.

13:22:31
ghostyx101: lmao

13:22:33
thdxr: if you're building a real app it's going to be on AWS, then it comes down to what language you want to use

13:22:35
ghostyx101: wacka flocka

13:22:36
<transcript>: Not a small line item. It's a chunk of our bill. But that's just one thing. Then there's compute.

13:22:36
<transcript>: just like

13:22:53
<transcript>: Just like Versailles has to upcharge like, that's their business. It's upcharge on top of aws. So I just hate that aws has become like the narrative around aws is that it's so expensive. And the narrative veron. Versailles is so cheap. And that's just so ridiculous, because marcel is built on top of aws. Okay.

13:22:56
<transcript>: Let's see.

13:22:56
<transcript>: if you are

13:23:00
<transcript>: If you are building real apps, I guess what would you all be using.

13:23:01
darrenbaldwin03: Exactly lmao

13:23:03
thdxr: I built SST for myself, someone who tries to build real companies so it's a balance of productive and can do high value things

13:23:15
<transcript>: Yeah, it depends thing. I mean, ssd is what I'm building everything with these days. I think I've always been building on aws. I mean, for the last five, six years, but sst gives you like a versaille like dev experience and getting better all the time.

13:23:20
<transcript>: But you're building on top of aws, primitives, and you have a lot more flexibility there.

13:23:20
<transcript>: so

13:23:24
<transcript>: So it's an oven. It's not a toaster. You know what I'm saying.

13:23:24
<transcript>: in the analogy

13:23:26
darrenbaldwin03: Deploying frontends on Vercel is fine -- just dont deploy backends that need high compute

13:23:29
<transcript>: In the analogy we talked about earlier, I want to bring balance to the force. That's right.

13:23:35
darrenbaldwin03: or prisma ^

13:23:47
<transcript>: Ssc is a great point to get your feet web with aws. In fact bmv, it's the best way to get started with aws. If DAX if you guys can solve the account creation problem, if you guys could just go ahead and solve that, that'd be great. I know you got the console thing you're working on. That's more important. But then if you could just solve the new account creation.

13:23:47
<transcript>: like

13:23:49
thdxr: yeah I know account creation after console

13:23:55
thdxr: then we can say we fixed aws

13:23:59
<transcript>: Like standing up new accounts problem. There will be no remaining problems that I can see for. Aw, I feel like it'd be so easy to just point build SSD Dev and off they go, you know what I mean.

<transcript>: If you're building a real app, it's going to be on aws, then it comes down to what language you want to use.

13:24:03
<transcript>: waka flak

13:24:04
dnbull: Ok bet, I'm going to try SST tonight. I sift through the docs yesterday to get an idea

13:24:06
<transcript>: Waka flaka. What is that.

13:24:06
<transcript>: waka

13:24:06
grasp5533: Is account factory not good?

13:24:08
<transcript>: Waka flocka.

13:24:09
thdxr: so sad that this is my job to fix their onboarding lol

13:24:17
<transcript>: Deploying front ends over itself is fine. Just don't deploy backends that need high compute or Prisma. Yeah, Prisma.

13:24:17
<transcript>: i know

13:24:22
darrenbaldwin03: @thdxr lmao

13:24:28
<transcript>: I know account creation after console. Then we can say we fix aws, exactly. Dax. At that point the mission is complete. Then it's just like, keep making the experience better.

13:24:38
<transcript>: I'm going to try sd tonight. Sift through the docs yesterday to get an idea. It's so good. It's so good. It's so good. Is account factory not good. What's the count factory. Oh, what's that.

13:24:38
<transcript>: yeah

13:24:52
<transcript>: Yeah, no kidding. Dex. Your job is fixing most of it. Okay. Twitter time. I said it was Twitter time. And then I just started ranting. You're never going to get paid a lot of money because you know how to deploy to versailles. You get paid a lot of money to build versailles. Go deeper. Oh, it's so good.

13:24:52
<transcript>: it's so

13:24:53
<transcript>: It's so good.

13:24:53
<transcript>: is it starting to look like

13:24:58
grasp5533: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/account-factory.html

13:24:59
<transcript>: Is it starting to look like a coordinated attack? Next, like me and you and Flight control.

13:25:03
<transcript>: Just like hammering on Versailles.

13:25:05
thdxr: @adamdotdev yes look at the reply

13:25:18
<transcript>: It's not a coordinated attack. It's just we're all waking up to some harsh realities. With the narrative, the narrative has gotten too thick. Look at the reply. Oh, no. Was there a reply? I missed it. Let me pull the tweet back up.

13:25:23
<transcript>: There it is.

13:25:23
<transcript>: copy

13:25:27
<transcript>: Copy link, Open link.

13:25:29
<transcript>: What was the reply.

13:25:30
thdxr: my angle is "here's how you get rich"

13:25:32
nexxeln: command shift t adam

13:25:43
jokestera_e: Theo gunna throw hands on these takes

13:25:45
<transcript>: My angle is here's how you get rich. That's a good angle. That is a good one. Command shift. T. What does that do.

13:25:53
<transcript>: What does that do? That reopened. Something. I closed. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me.

13:25:59
ferellon: I hadn't seen SST before now. Just been looking through the docs, looks awesome!

13:25:59
nexxeln: yepp

13:25:59
<transcript>: I did not know that was a thing. Next, theo going to throw hands on these takes. Yeah.

13:25:59
<transcript>: i love

13:26:08
elicxlive: People are just finally realising how much Vercel takes advantange of devs. At least, that's how I view it. They build a framework that tries so incredibly hard to lock people into their extortionate prices

13:26:18
dnbull: But that's theo's opinion lol.

13:26:19
<transcript>: I love Theo. I do. And I don't want this to sound like just anti theoretic. Because it's not that it's anti versailles. Rhetoric. Theo is not versaille. Theo loves versailles. I love racell. That's the thing. The thing that sucks here is that I love it. I use it all the time. I use nextjs. All the time.

13:26:22
<transcript>: Like this is not. You shouldn't use it.

13:26:29
<transcript>: You shouldn't be scared to use something else. And you're not incapable of learning something else. That's the problem with the rhetoric.

13:26:33
elicxlive: Isn't he sponsored by Vercel? So it kinda makes sense

13:26:41
<transcript>: Okay, developer experience is overrated. Whichever framework finds, the intersection between user experience and developer experience will win. Oh, I love this. And I'll tell you why, I love this. Was this recently? Yeah. Yesterday.

13:26:52
<transcript>: It's a trade off between. Usually, it shouldn't always be. I think eventually this isn't the case. But right now it's a trade off between. It feels like developer experience and runtime characteristics.

13:27:07
<transcript>: Like the best developer experience might be prisma, and you just push it to github and it ends up on versailles. But the runtime characteristics of that are awful, as Cal.com is finding out and countless others have found out.

13:27:07
<transcript>: and maybe a lot of people

13:27:08
darrenbaldwin03: Exactly!

13:27:11
nexxeln: yeah but he has been using vercel for way longer than he's been sponsored

13:27:16
heroictashcan: I don't agree with that statement

13:27:18
nexxeln: he truly loves vercel lol

13:27:21
<transcript>: And maybe a lot of people didn't even notice. Like you're a founder. You're just trying to hack together something and you don't really notice that your thing is really slow, and it shouldn't have to be that slow. But your users will notice and they'll feel it and that sides.

13:27:24
heroictashcan: DX and UX are not connected imho

13:27:39
<transcript>: I haven't seen ssd before. Now just been looking through the docs. Looks awesome. It is awesome. People are just finally realizing how much roselle takes advantage of devs. At least that's how I view it. They built a framework that tries so incredibly hard to lock people into their extortionate prices. Their pricing story sucks and.

13:27:42
<transcript>: There's a lot of things that bother me.

13:27:45
dnbull: i just need vercel to stop acting like they are apple of the tech world. they end up saying a bunch of nothing

13:27:47
<transcript>: The whole vibe of the brand like the whole branding being this elitist.

13:27:52
<transcript>: Sort of pretentious brand.

13:27:52
<transcript>: when

13:27:58
<transcript>: When dax said it, it's a front end hosting company like you're not Apple.

13:27:58
<transcript>: you don't make

13:28:01
<transcript>: You don't make amazing processors and hardware.

13:28:01
<transcript>: so the

13:28:03
thdxr: good dx leaves you with energy to focus on little ux details (like Adam said the other day it's about attention to detail)

13:28:04
<transcript>: So the pretentious thing just doesn't play that well for me.

13:28:05
heroictashcan: Vercel is only good if you stay in the free/hobby tier. After that, move away

13:28:09
thdxr: but yeah not directly connected

13:28:24
<transcript>: That's just like getting into nitpicky stuff at the end of the day again. I love rosell. I use her cell. It is not the answer to everything. And I don't know of a lot of wealth creation happening on versailles. I don't know a lot of founders founding a amazing startups that just are building on top of her cell. I know a lot of indie hackers and that's a whole nother conversation. It's like the difference in an indie.

13:28:25
teej_dv: vercel is creating wealth OMEGALUL

13:28:43
teej_dv: dunno about their users

13:28:44
<transcript>: Hacking endeavor. And a startup endeavor. I think there is a distinction. There's a formal kind of like, we're building a startup. I'm not an indie hacker. You know what I mean? There's kind of a difference. And if you're just indie hacking, go crazy, enjoy versailles. But if you're trying to build a startup and create real wealth or value.

13:28:50
<transcript>: You're going to have to learn some stuff you are. They can't shield you from the harsh world.

13:28:52
<transcript>: Okay.

13:28:55
nexxeln: hi teej

13:28:58
<transcript>: Isn't any sponsor of sales. That kind of makes sense. Yeah. Everybody's sponsored by yourself. That's the problem.

13:28:58
<transcript>: there's a lot of

13:29:01
thdxr: vercel isn't even creating wealth for vercel founders lol

13:29:04
<transcript>: There's a lot of sponsorship going around. When you raise $300 million, you can sponsor a lot of people. You know what I'm saying.

13:29:06
<transcript>: Okay.

13:29:06
<transcript>: rosel

13:29:09
<transcript>: Roselle isn't even creating welfare.

13:29:10
dnbull: I feel for Lee Rob though. such a great guy and he replies looking for honest feedback and he gets jerks to reply

13:29:11
<transcript>: Teaches here.

13:29:12
teej_dv: @nexxeln o/

13:29:17
<transcript>: Okay, so time to tell you guys about a thing. A hell issue.

13:29:20
<transcript>: It's going away.

13:29:23
<transcript>: But I have an issue.

13:29:23
<transcript>: where

13:29:24
<transcript>: Where.

13:29:26
thdxr: uh oh

13:29:30
coolpantstv: Best part about Vercel is no credit card required, don't need to worry about owing them a bunch of money out of no where

13:29:31
thdxr: Adam has farts

13:29:33
teej_dv: suffering from ligma FeelsBadMan

13:29:36
dnbull: Boomer rant? Kappa

13:29:44
<transcript>: I've Googled it, but I've never gone to a doctor. I actually did go to a doctor. And they were like, I'm not concerned. And I was like, Well, I'm concerned. They're like, no, I'm not concerned. So I guess I'm not concerned. I get this. It's like, esophag. And not esophagus. What's that? Diaphragm. I get a diaphragm. Hernia, I think, is the term like a herniated. Diaphragm. Something like.

13:29:44
<transcript>: my stomach

13:29:48
<transcript>: My stomach or something goes up into.

13:29:48
dnbull: ouch

13:29:50
<transcript>: My through my.

13:29:56
<transcript>: Diaphragm. It's like when I breathe in too deep and stretch a little too much.

13:29:59
thdxr: Adam wtf is that hand gesture

13:30:00
elicxlive: That doesn't sound nice :(

13:30:01
thdxr: jesus

13:30:06
grasp5533: @thdxr exactly my thoughts

13:30:06
itsmeleague: Fisting?

13:30:08
<transcript>: And it hurts all the way through my left side, my shoulder. Everything is like I feel like I'm going to die. And if I lay flat on the ground, it goes away. So there you go.

13:30:08
<transcript>: it's not

13:30:09
teej_dv: @thdxr monkaS not safe for stream monkaS

13:30:12
<transcript>: It's not good, and the Doctor was not concerned. So I guess.

13:30:12
<transcript>: we're not concerned

13:30:14
<transcript>: We're not concerned.

13:30:14
<transcript>: but

13:30:20
<transcript>: But it happens. I don't know. Three or four times a day. My family just knows now, when I lay down on the floor, it's because.

13:30:20
<transcript>: i'm in deathly pain

13:30:27
dnbull: doctors say that to get you out of there :(

13:30:28
<transcript>: I'm in deathly pain. It just happened to me. I tried to play it off, but I just need to tell you guys I'm going to lay on the floor now because.

13:30:28
<transcript>: my

13:30:31
<transcript>: My stomach is in my lung cavity.

13:30:31
jokestera_e: Oh snap tj in the house

13:30:34
<transcript>: Okay.

13:30:34
<transcript>: i'm okay

13:30:35
itsmeleague: Feel free to lay down

13:30:38
<transcript>: I'm okay now. I might have started sweating a little bit.

13:30:38
<transcript>: let's see

13:30:43
<transcript>: Let's see. I'm trying to catch up on chat. Oh, I was still doing Twitter time, and I just moved away.

13:30:43
<transcript>: what is

13:30:44
teej_dv: @jokesterA_E so now there are two jokesters here

13:30:47
<transcript>: What is the hand gesture? What was the hand gesture? Did I do a hand gesture.

13:30:49
dnbull: you should request MRI, cat scan, etc...

13:30:49
jokestera_e: lmao yes

13:30:50
<transcript>: As far as it's not that.

13:30:50
<transcript>: it's not

13:30:52
bluearrowredbird: that's a hernia

13:30:56
dmmulroy: if you lay down you could use dax's zuko cam

13:30:56
<transcript>: It's not gastrointestinal. Best part about bracelet is no credit card required. Don't need to worry about.

13:30:56
<transcript>: something

13:31:01
<transcript>: Something I can't see all chat. It's cutting it off. A bunch of money out of nowhere.

13:31:07
<transcript>: Oh, no credit card required. Yeah. Again, a lot of great things about bracel.

13:31:07
dnbull: you don't want things to get worse because of your doctor, doctors can be wrong.

13:31:09
<transcript>: Teaches here.

13:31:20
<transcript>: Roselle is only good if you stay in the free hobby tier after that, move away. Good DX leaves you with energy to focus on little UX details like Adam said the other day, it's about attention to detail. It really is.

13:31:24
<transcript>: Just needs for self to stop acting like they are Apple of the tech world. They end up.

13:31:27
<transcript>: I can't see that word. A bunch of nothing.

13:31:32
<transcript>: Yeah? No Theo.

13:31:40
<transcript>: Next. I think you're saying theo has been using versailles way longer than saturn. Absolutely. I've been using for sale a long time. They're great.

13:31:44
binajmen: now is the time to ask teej to add ctrl+u in the search window :)

13:31:46
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't think theo loves herself because he's sponsored. I think he's sponsored because he loves herself.

13:31:46
<transcript>: and

13:31:48
<transcript>: And that's totally fine.

13:31:53
<transcript>: Okay, I already read that. And scrolling, trolling, scrolling.

13:31:57
teej_dv: @adamdotdev i'm about to start full stack ocaml PogChamp death to js, long live ocaml

13:32:13
<transcript>: I feel for Lerob, though, such a great guy and he replies looking for honest feedback and he gets jerks to reply, yeah, there is a lot of like I will say it's a bad time to be kind of like coming out against forcell because it does feel like it's becoming trendy. Everyone's kind of coming out against forcell. And some of it's not the kindest.

13:32:13
<transcript>: in terms of

13:32:21
<transcript>: In terms of criticism, I don't want to do that. I don't want to tear down versailles. Like, I think they're bad people. They're not. I just.

13:32:21
<transcript>: think the the

13:32:24
nexxeln: @teej_dv i want in

levidayne: ReasonML users rise up

13:32:27
darrenbaldwin03: @teej_dv 👀

13:32:28
<transcript>: Think the the broader community's perception of things is warped and it needs to be corrected a bit. That's all.

13:32:32
thdxr: there are perpetual vercel haters but the recent wave are from people using vercel at large scale

13:32:37
<transcript>: Suffering from ligma doesn't sound nice. Yeah. No, it's not nice.

13:32:39
teej_dv: down with ReasonML, long live real ocaml

13:32:44
darrenbaldwin03: Switching to ReScript

13:32:49
teej_dv: NEVER RESCRIPT

13:32:51
teej_dv: reasonml is fine

13:32:54
itsmeleague: HAHAHAHA

13:32:56
<transcript>: Fisting. What is it? Oh, what was this hand gesture? Yeah, that was whatever part of my body that's on the south side of my diaphragm is entering into the north side of my diaphragm. There is a hole in my diaphragm. This is all what I've gathered. The doctor was not helpful. They didn't tell me this, but the Internet told me this.

13:32:56
<transcript>: it was like

13:32:57
<transcript>: It was like.

13:32:57

darrenbaldwin03: @teej_dv Wait, you can use OCaml without ReasnML LUL

13:33:08
itsmeleague: Someone clip that

13:33:09
<transcript>: My insides are locked into a ball and I can't move my left arm and I have to lay down before it goes away and they're all like hernia.

13:33:09
<transcript>: and i was like

13:33:12
<transcript>: And I was like, but it's not down low.

13:33:12
<transcript>: it's like

13:33:14
<transcript>: It's like in the middle.

13:33:14
<transcript>: that's called

13:33:16
teej_dv: @nexxeln i will yayaya, we're trying so far with just ocaml + htmx

13:33:21
thdxr: @teej_dv reasonml is my dream

13:33:21
<transcript>: That's called a diaphragm or diaphragmal hernia or something? I don't know. The Internet was way more helpful than the doctor.

13:33:23
teej_dv: @adamdotdev do you have any thoughts on htmx?

13:33:25
nexxeln: ooo html acornEyes

13:33:25
dnbull: thats def a "out of context" clip LUL

13:33:27
nexxeln: htmx*

13:33:30
<transcript>: Arrow redbird. Thank you. Welcome to Chat. That's a hernia. Thank you. I'm glad we've been able to figure it out, despite the Doctor trying to kill me.

13:33:30
<transcript>: they say

13:33:31
thdxr: do they have async yet lol

13:33:33
<transcript>: They say that to get you out of there. Awesome.

13:33:38
nexxeln: who says html isn't a programming language

13:33:42
teej_dv: @dnbull ez giphy

13:33:47
<transcript>: Request an mri casting. So they did an X ray, which I don't know. It's not my bones. My bones are not the problem. Why did you do an X ray? That's what they did, though. Did an X ray? Said there's nothing. It's fine.

13:33:49
dnbull: :D

13:33:51
darrenbaldwin03: @teej_dv Htmx is sick

13:33:52
<transcript>: If you lay down, you could use stacks of zuko Cam.

13:33:58
<transcript>: .1 of my cameras at the ground for the moment that I get one of those spasms hernias, whatever.

13:33:58
<transcript>: you don't want

13:33:59
teej_dv: @thdxr for reasonml? i assume yeah, ppl do real stuff w/ it (or some way to do similar at least)

13:34:05
<transcript>: You don't want things to get worse because of your doctor. Doctors can be wrong. It's true. Now is the time to ask T's to add control U in the search window. Oh Yeah.

13:34:05
<transcript>: i

13:34:06
laame: hernias are the worst... MRI is the goto to for them...

13:34:09
<transcript>: I'll show you T. I'm about to start full stack of camel.

13:34:20
<transcript>: It just jumped on me. The chat jumped. What did you say? Death to js. Long live o camel. I really got to get into o camel thing. You're so passionate about it. I know it must be good because I respect you and.

13:34:20
<transcript>: you're into the

13:34:25
laame: well to diagnose them

13:34:26
<transcript>: You're into the Oakamel stuff. I'm running elixir today. T? Is that lycoml? I don't know.

13:34:33
dnbull: I agree with laame, if you are experience pain I think MRI is the way to go. I think you want to be safe here.

13:34:35
nexxeln: not at all

13:34:36
<transcript>: Reason ml users rise up there are perpetual versailles haters, but the recent wave are from people using versaille at large scale. That's what I think.

13:34:36
teej_dv: elixir deez....?

13:34:37
laame: I've had two of them removed already

13:34:38
<transcript>: Okay.

13:34:38
<transcript>: don't do

13:34:41
<transcript>: Don't do it again. Don't do what again? Oh, no.

13:34:46
heroictashcan: I'm ignorant, ocaml seriously worth looking into?

13:34:47
<transcript>: Someone clipped that. Oh, no. What did you clip? What did I say.

13:34:48
darrenbaldwin03: Elixir is great

13:34:51
nexxeln: yes @heroictashcan

13:34:53
<transcript>: Adam, do you have any thoughts on htmx? Never used it. It's interesting.

13:34:59
<transcript>: Anyone in Chat have any comments on HTMX.

13:35:06
<transcript>: Do they have async yet who says html is in a programming language that was good.

13:35:06
<transcript>: ht

13:35:16
<transcript>: Htms is sick. Okay, so some people that have opinions about it, I really don't have an opinion tiege. I've never used it. People do real stuff with it.

13:35:16
<transcript>: hernia

13:35:18
teej_dv: i'm having a lot of fun w/ ocaml, but dunno about getting a job actually writing it (you can always make your own jobs tho!)

13:35:21
<transcript>: Herniates are the worst. Mri is the go to okay. I need to get an MRI. Okay.

13:35:30
binajmen: ctrl+u

13:35:33
<transcript>: If you're experiencing pain, I think mri is the way to go. You want to be safe here? Yeah. It's been years. It happened in the peak of statues days. I didn't know if it was stress induced.

13:35:33
heroictashcan: I do C++ and Rust for the most part, so I have no idea what I'll be getting into with ocaml

13:35:40
<transcript>: Okay. Seriously worth. You've had two of them removed already. Like hernias in your diaphragm. Really.

13:35:40
<transcript>: i'm quite

13:35:43
nexxeln: ocaml is better than rust

13:35:48
laame: no L5-S1

13:35:50
<transcript>: I'm quite sure that's exactly where it is. It's got to be my diaphragm. I looked into it. There is a hole where your esophagus goes through the diaphragm. And sometimes that hole can get enlarged.

13:35:50
<transcript>: and then

13:35:52
heroictashcan: @nexxeln oh

13:35:53
<transcript>: And then your stomach gets sucked up in there. Sometimes.

13:35:53
<transcript>: that could be what

13:35:55
<transcript>: That could be what it is.

13:35:55
<transcript>: or

13:35:58
nexxeln: imo*

<transcript>: Here. I was reading some tweets.

13:36:16
<transcript>: Yeah. So I like this. Tweet. I like this because.

13:36:24
levidayne: Something sucked up in your large hole you say?

13:36:24
<transcript>: It does feel like we're just trading all of the user experience to have a better developer experience. I don't think that'll always be the case. I think eventually.

13:36:24
<transcript>: we'll have

13:36:29
<transcript>: We'll have it all, but we're not there yet. Oh, we already saw this one.

13:36:29
<transcript>: already

<transcript>: Already saw that one.

13:36:31
<transcript>: if else

13:36:37
<transcript>: That's funny.

13:36:37
<transcript>: did you tw

<transcript>: Did you tweet that after.

13:36:38
<transcript>: you said that

nexxeln: THIS BLOG POST IS OCAML

13:37:09
nexxeln: the one i linked in the tweet

13:37:17
<transcript>: The sap muse Electric code base is huge. And it's because the lead developer, our Web Dev at the time really wanted to learn and use elixir more in production. So he created his own reality. We said, run with it, build it in elixir. And he did. And that's one way to do it.

13:37:20
<transcript>: Okay.

13:37:23
teej_dv: exactly, you can always make your own jobs :)

13:37:25

thdxr: dynamodb novice alex

13:38:18
<transcript>: So Haskell Julia. C. What is that one? What is that.

13:38:18

13:38:19
<transcript>: rust type

13:38:21
<transcript>: Rust typescript.

13:38:21
<transcript>: i should know

13:38:30
<transcript>: I should know what that is, but I don't kotlin php C sharp don't know, elixir, what's that one? So that's your a tier.

13:38:30
teej_dv: .... where's ocaml tho then??

13:38:33
nexxeln: f# cause they didn't have ocaml,

13:38:35
<transcript>: Looks like the bottom. Actually your D tier, go javascript and C plus plus.

13:38:35
<transcript>: a

13:38:36
elicxlive: Go at the bottom :(

13:38:40
<transcript>: A. C. For lua, cobalt, Pearl groovy, and.

13:39:11
<transcript>: And then B. Tier. You've got ruby, java, Python.

13:39:11

<transcript>: I agree that provider is pushing what's possible is good. However.

13:39:43
<transcript>: oh okay so

13:39:52
<transcript>: Oh, okay. So this is a quote tweet of good web technology works on every info provider. I hate the sentiment. I don't want to live in a world where the best frameworks are limited by the most outdated providers.

13:39:57
<transcript>: I agree that providers pushing what's possible is good. Okay, so providers.

13:40:01
<transcript>: Would be the like versaille. Okay.

13:40:04
<transcript>: Then pushing what's possible is good. However.

13:40:06
nexxeln: vercel

13:40:07
<transcript>: I would never deploy somewhere without.

13:40:07
<transcript>: a viable off

13:40:13
gitpush_gitpaid: @nexxeln yea youre not human. convinced.

13:40:18
<transcript>: A viable off ramp. Ooh. This is good. This offramp might include performance and or convenience degradation, but that's part of the calculation. Love this tweet so good.

13:40:18

13:40:51
darrenbaldwin03: Except why use something that doesnt scale when you very well know ur gonna have to move off later?

13:40:52
nexxeln: yeah

13:41:01
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't think. I don't think Web technology has to work on every infra provider to be good.

13:41:01
<transcript>: but

13:41:08
<transcript>: But I think it's a feature like astro. Working on everything is really nice. I'm not saying.

13:41:08
<transcript>: that

13:41:28
<transcript>: That if you're not astro, you're not good. But I do think it's a feature and it's a trade off that I like. I quite like astro. I love the portability of it having worked on nextjs apps a lot and knowing that I have to put it on versaille because it's not going to really do everything I want elsewhere. I like that feature of it, but I don't think it's a requirement. It's just another feature.

13:41:28
<transcript>: anyway t three

13:41:31
sargath666: PHP wprks on any provider, and no - PHP is not dead ;)

13:41:33
<transcript>: Anyway T three stacked users when they find someone using some other stack for web Dev.

13:41:33
<transcript>: no

13:41:38
<transcript>: No tie safety so T three SEC users.

13:41:38
<transcript>: can

13:41:40
<transcript>: Can I say.

13:41:42

13:41:51
teej_dv: LUL typescript + safety

13:41:53
<transcript>: Does T three have like type safety cornered? If you don't use T three, that doesn't mean you're not.

13:41:53
<transcript>: using

13:41:56
thdxr: well Adam struggled with no typesafety with elixir

13:41:57
<transcript>: Using typesafe stuff, right? I mean, I know I'm writing elixir right now.

13:41:57
<transcript>: but

13:41:58
<transcript>: But.

13:42:00
darrenbaldwin03: @teej_dv this

13:42:02
darrenbaldwin03: lmao

13:42:10
<transcript>: Adam struggled with no tide safety with elixir. I mean, it definitely hurts, but is the T three sac the only way to have type safety is the market cornered on type safety.

13:42:10
nexxeln: yeah this just a meme LUL

13:42:13
<transcript>: Typescript plus safety.

13:42:18

13:42:22
<transcript>: I like that goofy alien guy. He's funny. Okay.

13:42:22

13:42:25

<transcript>: dax

13:42:30

13:42:34
<transcript>: Could you? Perhaps perchance. Dax. Could.

13:42:34
<transcript>: you

13:42:36

13:42:36
<transcript>: that

13:42:39
darrenbaldwin03: You can use tRPC with any web framework

13:42:41
<transcript>: That little snippet again? Do you have that handy anywhere.

13:42:47
<transcript>: I think I have to do something that's going to look really weird, not lay on the floor. I just have to do this again.

13:42:47
<transcript>: even though

13:42:55
<transcript>: Even though I didn't go anywhere because otherwise it doesn't turn off Twitter time. I think I have to do that. I don't know if that'll do it honestly.

13:42:57
<transcript>: Maybe if I do this actually.

13:43:00
<transcript>: It's work time. Let's work.

13:43:05
<transcript>: I think that'll end it. I have to end the segment. I got to work on that.

13:43:05
<transcript>: i don't want it

13:43:07
<transcript>: I don't want it to continue.

13:43:09
teej_dv: @darrenbaldwin03 oh it works with java spring?

darrenbaldwin03: @teej_dv *any thing that uses typescript LUL

13:43:34
<transcript>: So many issues. Look at this has no local return.

13:43:37
<transcript>: What do you mean, no local return.

13:43:39
<transcript>: It's a local return.

13:43:39
<transcript>: sir

13:43:40
<transcript>: Sir.

13:43:45
<transcript>: Not returning something when I do repo one.

13:43:48
thdxr: dude has no local return is the WORST

13:43:51
<transcript>: Nil if no result would sound.

13:43:51
<transcript>: but

13:43:53
thdxr: it's a misleading error

13:43:54
<transcript>: But otherwise it returns something right.

13:43:55
darrenbaldwin03: @teej_dv Springboot is already pretty typesafe

13:44:02
<transcript>: Has no local return is the worst. It's a misleading error. Oh bummer.

13:44:02
<transcript>: bummer

13:44:03
teej_dv: yeah, i was just memeing

13:44:03
<transcript>: Bummer.

13:44:04
thdxr: it just means something in the function is type error

13:44:08
darrenbaldwin03: @teej_dv good one

13:44:12
<transcript>: Just means something in the function is type error.

13:44:12
<transcript>: oh okay

13:44:18
thdxr: solution is to turn off dialixir

13:44:19
<transcript>: Oh okay, that's dumb. So call to missing or unexpected function ectoquery count so that is not a thing.

13:44:19
<transcript>: can't

13:44:21
<transcript>: Can't do the query.

13:44:21
<transcript>: count thing

13:44:23
<transcript>: Count thing.

13:44:27
<transcript>: Solution is to turn off dielyxer.

13:44:27
<transcript>: but it's been

13:44:29
<transcript>: But it's been helpful sometimes.

13:44:29
<transcript>: i like

13:44:31
<transcript>: I like it.

13:44:35
thdxr: hope this isn't turning @nexxeln off to elixir

13:44:39
<transcript>: Let's see the pattern beginning of months can never match the type struct. Elixir date time.

13:44:41
<transcript>: What.

13:44:48
<transcript>: Oh no.

13:44:48
<transcript>: this is not

13:44:50
imanyone: Repo.aggregate(query, :count) will do the count

13:44:53
<transcript>: This is not elixir's fault. It's my fault. Everything on this stream is going to be my fault.

13:44:53
gitpush_gitpaid: i have a quick question. when statmuse(i am not affiliated) started, did you guys use api's? or scraping stats? looks like you guys started in 2015 and i feel like the nba didnt have an api at the time

13:44:54
<transcript>: Is great.

13:44:57
nexxeln: im already quite turned off by untyped langs @thdxr LUL

13:45:00
nexxeln: but i like elixir

13:45:07
<transcript>: This is a very large elector code base. Probably doesn't help repo aggregate query count will do the count. Okay so I can do repo aggregate.

13:45:07
<transcript>: like

13:45:08
<transcript>: Like that.

13:45:08
<transcript>: i don't

13:45:17
<transcript>: I don't know if I need to do the ID thing, but query is piped in and then repo one. I think that's all good. It's just this date time issue.

13:45:19
imanyone: Then you won't need the Repo.one

13:45:21
<transcript>: Date time now. So let's do this.

13:45:21
nexxeln: i only like two dynamically typed langs, elixir and python

13:45:22
<transcript>: Let's do.

13:45:22
<transcript>: first

13:45:24
<transcript>: First of month.

13:45:24
<transcript>: equ

13:45:27
<transcript>: Equals date time.

13:45:27
<transcript>: dot

13:45:28
<transcript>: Dot.

13:45:30
<transcript>: Beginning of month.

13:45:33
<transcript>: Date, time.

13:45:33
darrenbaldwin03: Damn, if Elixir had types it would be really good

13:45:36

13:46:08
<transcript>: First of month. Thank you so much for the follow. Somebody. Sodium overdose. I appreciate your follow.

13:46:12

13:46:12
<transcript>: then you won't need

13:46:16
gitpush_gitpaid: @gitpush_gitpaid MaxLOL

13:46:16
<transcript>: Then you won't need the repo one. Oh, aggregate returns.

13:46:18
<transcript>: Okay, cool.

13:46:22
<transcript>: Oh, did we do it.

13:46:22
<transcript>: utc

13:46:25

13:46:28
<transcript>: Are you sure.

13:46:33
<transcript>: Now.

13:46:36
<transcript>: Sure about this.

13:46:56
<transcript>: What is the question? I'm also quite turned off by untyped lengths. Sorry, guys. Elixir is untyped. If I was the bearer of bad news, I apologize. Matt summers welcome. I mean, thank you for the follow. My brain got a little mixed up. I almost welcomed you to chat. You're not in chat. You just followed me, and I appreciate it.

13:46:56
<transcript>: if elix

13:47:02
teej_dv: is gleam basically typed elixir?

13:47:06
<transcript>: If Elixir had Typed it would be really good. Is that what Haskell is or ocamel is okamel. Just elixir with types. Tj.

13:47:11
<transcript>: Gleam. Basically type elixir. That's a better question. You know, things.

13:47:14
nexxeln: its more like rust tho

13:47:17
thdxr: gleam is nice

13:47:21
<transcript>: Beginning of month. It's a thing. It is a thing now. Oh, I didn't import it. Is that what I'm saying? I just need to require date time or something.

13:47:25
teej_dv: yeah, it is more like rust -- but i don't think it has borrow checker? righ?

thdxr: my issue is now that serverless exists I don't care about BEAM anymore

13:47:44

<transcript>: eight

13:49:37
<transcript>: Eight months. Allen. Wow.

13:49:37
<transcript>: so

13:49:42
<transcript>: So much of that was before I had met you. I didn't know you like, I know you now.

13:49:49
vapor__dev: here's to 8 more HSCheers

13:50:02
<transcript>: Oh, no, git push. I missed your question. What was your question? There's just a lot going on right now in Chat. Where did I miss it? Get pushed, get paid, get pushed, get paid. Have a quick question. Oh, wow. I did miss all this repo to aggregate. We'll do the count. I saw that. Okay, I have a quick question. When stat muse. I am not affiliated. Start it.

13:50:05
<transcript>: Play on the rust thing.

13:50:13
vapor__dev: does anyone do elm anymore?

13:50:16
<transcript>: Did you guys use apis or scraping stats? Looks like you guys start in 2015. I feel like the NBA didn't have an api at the time. Great question. Get push. Fantastic question.

13:50:16
<transcript>: in

13:50:23
<transcript>: In 2014 when we started it in July of 2014, I scraped staff NBA.com.

13:50:29
teej_dv: elm as a lang seems dead, maybe ppl still using it tho

13:50:31
<transcript>: Before we really went live. So we had, like, a private beta with that scraped data. It was terrible.

13:50:31
<transcript>: all kinds of

13:50:51
<transcript>: All kinds of issues. We used to tell all kinds of stories about the stats. Nba.com. You could go to nba.com. And there were certain players that would have data, like a 99 assist game. And that just isn't the case. It was just data entry issues like it was supposed to be nine. And they just hit nine twice. So there's just all kinds of holes in the data. And it was so much more obvious on the stat muse private Beta because.

13:50:58
vapor__dev: @teej_dv yeah feel like i never hear it anymore but one comp i talked to is super into it

13:51:07
<transcript>: You could just ask any question. So if you said who had the most assist in the game, it was like lionel Collins, 99 assists. That's not true. So it really showed itself on Satinwes. Whereas you couldn't really tell on stats on nba.com because you had to find that player and then look at their game log. And you're like that's wrong.

13:51:07
<transcript>: so anyway

13:51:16
<transcript>: So anyway, scrapedmba.com. Then when we raised our seed, we hired Justin Cabacco, who's the creator of Basketball reference.

13:51:31
<transcript>: He was at sat me for like five years. He's probably like the world's leading sports statistician. He spent a decade digitizing old newspapers and media guides. He worked for several NBA teams, and he has all these connections. Somebody will email him.

13:51:31
<transcript>: from

13:51:40
<transcript>: From the blazers. And they'll be like, hey, we found this old media guide from 1946. You want it? And he'd be like, yes, and then he would put all of the stats into his database. So he has this amazing.

13:51:45
<transcript>: Incredible Sports Database across all four North American sports.

13:51:45
<transcript>: so

13:51:48
<transcript>: So we own all that data. Now we license it from.

13:51:48
<transcript>: him perpe

13:51:49
imanyone: yeah everyone I know who uses elm loves it, but it's not popular

13:51:50
<transcript>: Him perpetually.

13:51:50
<transcript>: so we

13:51:54
<transcript>: So we kind of bought it all off of him. But he worked there for five years at stat muse. When I was there.

13:51:58
<transcript>: That's where our data comes from now.

13:52:06
<transcript>: Pesky pesky pesky pesky patagonis. Thank you for that follow. I appreciate your follow.

13:52:06
<transcript>: here's

13:52:10
<transcript>: Here's. Eight more. That's right. Vapor. Eight more months. It's happening.

13:52:13
<transcript>: Does anyone do elm anymore.

13:52:14
darrenbaldwin03: How does the data stay updated?

13:52:16
<transcript>: Okay.

13:52:16
<transcript>: did this work

13:52:22
<transcript>: Did this work? Did we fix all the issues? Let's see if we fixed it. Let's see if it's fixed.

13:52:26
<transcript>: Try it out.

13:52:27
teej_dv: https://github.com/elm/compiler no updates since sep 2022

13:52:30
<transcript>: Most Assists in a game.

13:52:42
<transcript>: Yeah. I need to go to the doctor, don't I? I probably have some hernia thing. I need to get fixed. Okay. Still have an issue.

13:52:44
<transcript>: Cast error.

13:52:46
teej_dv: and that was one commit, otherwise previous was april 2022

13:52:50
teej_dv: so basically 1 update in the past year

13:52:56
<transcript>: So there's still something wrong with this date time check. Is it because it's a date and not a date time like this doesn't have the time element, and I need it to.

13:52:57
thdxr: can we retire the phrase "gatekeeping"

13:52:59
<transcript>: That's what the problem is, isn't it.

13:53:01
<transcript>: Utc Date time.

13:53:04
<transcript>: And some other instances here.

13:53:06
teej_dv: rofl dax LITERALLY gatekeeping gatekeeping

13:53:07
<transcript>: We need to create a date time out of a date.

13:53:09
thdxr: it's now just a way to tell people they never have to try

13:53:18
<transcript>: Maybe I should just kind of ask chat gbt how to do that.

13:53:20
thdxr: @teej_dv it cancels out

13:53:25
pbertrand_dev: Teej, you just posted a link to the elm github but you are not affiliated to the elm foundation. Just a friendly warning to becareful so you dont get sued

13:53:28
teej_dv: no, you're the one getting cancelled

13:53:29
thdxr: I'm the only one NOT gatekeeping

13:53:30
<transcript>: Let's just do chat. Dbd.

13:59:49
thdxr: proof Adam is a scammer

14:00:04
<transcript>: A string, because that's going to do it down here. I just need to create it needs to be a date time, not a date proof. Adam is a scammer. Oh, my goodness. Cosmic. Welcome to Chat. It's just daytime, new with a date. And then a time. Okay, so date time.

14:01:27
thdxr: no I didn't

14:01:29
<transcript>: When I'm done, you'll stream, cool.

14:01:35
<transcript>: I'll be done I'll be done sometime. Most assists in a game.

14:01:36
thdxr: Liz leaving has destroyed my routine

14:01:37
<transcript>: What is going on.

14:01:40
<transcript>: It's not recompiling my code.

14:01:40
<transcript>: or

14:01:52
<transcript>: Or maybe it is no function clause matching in naive daytime. Why does it say that I'm not doing naive daytime? I'm not doing anything with naive. I'm saving the buffer, right? Written, done.

14:01:55
<transcript>: Where is this naive date time nonsense.

14:01:57
<transcript>: Naive.

14:02:00
<transcript>: No, I'm not using it.

14:02:00
<transcript>: i'm not

14:02:02
<transcript>: I'm not using it.

14:02:05
goodgrandpaa: Good morning good morning!

14:02:05
<transcript>: Need to restart.

14:02:10
<transcript>: Just restart it. Why not? Good morning. Good grandpa.

14:02:12
<transcript>: Just restart it.

14:02:18
cosmicladyrosa: oh the issue is that Time.new is returning an OK tuple

14:02:19
<transcript>: Oh, dax, I forgot. Liz is gone for a week. Oh, it's the worst.

14:02:19
<transcript>: i hate

14:02:29
<transcript>: I hate my routine being so disrupted. And there's nothing that says I couldn't just keep my routine. I don't know why I just can't. When casey's gone, everything changes.

14:02:31
<transcript>: It's the worst.

14:02:33
<transcript>: Okay.

14:02:33
<transcript>: most ass

14:02:36
<transcript>: Most Assists in a game.

14:02:42
<transcript>: What in the world is going on? It's acting like the code is.

14:02:42
<transcript>: still using

14:02:44
thdxr: she's not here to observe me failing my routing

14:02:44
<transcript>: Still using naive daytime.

14:02:44
<transcript>: i'm not

14:02:48
<transcript>: I'm not. I promise. Calendar. Daytime. Oh, wait.

14:02:48
thdxr: big motivater

14:02:49
<transcript>: Oh, wait.

14:02:54
imanyone: I think cosmic is right, the docs would confirm it

14:02:57
<transcript>: This is the problem. It's using it inside the datetime. New. It's doing naive daytime. Okay.

14:02:57
<transcript>: time

14:03:00
vapor__dev: dax u coming up too or nah?

14:03:00
<transcript>: Time new is returning an okay tuple.

14:03:05
<transcript>: Time, new.

14:03:05
<transcript>: stupid cop

14:03:06
thdxr: yeah

14:03:08
<transcript>: Stupid copilot messing me up so we need to do.

14:03:11
<transcript>: Blank time.

14:03:18
<transcript>: Like this.

14:03:22
<transcript>: Time. Dot new.

14:03:25
<transcript>: Like that.

14:03:35
imanyone: Time.new! won't return a tuple

14:03:36
<transcript>: Can I do that? Is that the appropriate syntax, like unpacking a tuple.

14:03:43
goodgrandpaa: Last night I was watching middle ground and thought about how somebody should build a show like that where it's like front-end vs back-end, frameworks vs frameworks, or even language vs language, would be funny.

14:03:44
<transcript>: Oh, I could have just done time. Dot new. Well, there you go. I don't want a tuple.

14:03:46
imanyone: ! suffixed functions won't return tuples :)

14:03:47
<transcript>: No tuple.

14:03:47
<transcript>: just

14:03:50
<transcript>: Just straight and give it to me.

14:03:55
<transcript>: I'm not new. Awesome. Love it that's way better. Okay.

14:03:55
<transcript>: what's

14:03:58
<transcript>: What's wrong though? Syntax error.

14:03:58
<transcript>: it's so

14:04:03
<transcript>: It's so slow, it's so slow the lsp is so slow.

14:04:04
<transcript>: Let's try it again.

14:04:05
thdxr: hey guys I have a really funny video planned

14:04:08
<transcript>: Most Assists in a game.

14:04:13
thdxr: idk if we'll pull it off but next Monday

14:04:14
<transcript>: Last night I was watching middle ground.

14:04:20
<transcript>: Wait. I missed something. She's not here to deserve me feeling my routing failing your routing.

14:04:23
thdxr: it will either be the funniest thing ever or FLOP

14:04:23
<transcript>: What.

14:04:26
<transcript>: Your routing Big motivator.

14:04:31
<transcript>: I think cosmic is right. The docs would confirm it.

14:04:31
<transcript>: what did cosm

14:04:34
<transcript>: What did cosmic say? I'm just catching up here.

14:04:38
<transcript>: Oh, date time. New is a date? And then a time? Yeah.

14:04:50
ittzsushi: He meant routine I guess

14:04:57
<transcript>: Last night, I was watching Middle Ground and thought about how somebody should build a show like that where it's like front, inverse back end frameworks versus frameworks, or even language versus language would be funny. That sounds interesting. I don't know what Middle Ground is, but that does sound interesting.

14:05:09
<transcript>: Really funny video plan. I don't know if we pull it off, but next Monday, it will either be the funniest thing ever. Or flop. Is this the thing you told me about dax? Because it's going to be so funny. Oh, my goodness, I can't wait.

14:05:11
thdxr: yes

14:05:19
<transcript>: Random. Random. Nine. Not Elon. Thank you so much for that. Follow. Now, I kind of think it's Elon because he said it's not Elon.

14:05:19
<transcript>: that

14:05:21
<transcript>: That's suspicious.

14:05:21
<transcript>: no

14:05:26
<transcript>: No, it's still not working. That's the okay tuple thing. Wait, what.

14:05:31
<transcript>: Do I say the buffer. I probably didn't save it.

14:05:34
<transcript>: Time, new.

14:05:35
goodgrandpaa: It's a jubilee youtube episodical that takes people from differing points of views and give multiple prompts and try to debate slightly and find some sort of level of understanding.

14:05:43
<transcript>: As somebody asked me earlier, most assists in a game. I don't remember who asked me, but they asked me how I toggle between.

14:05:43
<transcript>: a terminal

14:05:46
<transcript>: A terminal. I just use tmux.

14:05:49
<transcript>: I've got these panes. Here.

14:05:51
<transcript>: What did I do.

14:05:58
<transcript>: Restart this. I've got these panes, and I can just move around in them, and I make one bigger, that's all.

14:06:01
<transcript>: Tmux stuff.

14:06:13
<transcript>: Oh, mandex, I'm excited. I'm very excited. I can't wait to see you pull that video off because there's a lot in that video, a lot of elements. It's going to be an editing. Good time.

14:06:13
<transcript>: on the editing

14:06:14
<transcript>: On the editing right.

14:06:29
gitpush_gitpaid: @thdxr alright everyone we see how excited they are about this video. we need to show support.

14:06:31
<transcript>: Most assists in a game. It's a Jubilee YouTube episode episodical that takes people from different points of views and gives multiple prompts and try to debate slightly and find some sort of level of understanding that sounds very nice. Sounds like our community.

14:06:31
<transcript>: in tech could

14:06:33
<transcript>: In tech could use some of that.

14:06:37
<transcript>: Cast error still got a cast error.

14:06:41
<transcript>: Oh, man, logger.

14:06:43
thdxr: yeah laugh no matter what

14:06:46
<transcript>: Let's log with time and see what it looks like.

14:06:50
<transcript>: About that.

14:06:55
pbertrand_dev: HAHAHA LMAO

14:06:59
<transcript>: Most assist in the game should log something at least.

14:07:10
<transcript>: Everyone. We see how excited they are about this video. We need to show support. It's going to be so good. Yeah. Dax.

14:07:10
<transcript>: we will support

14:07:13
<transcript>: We will support it. It's going to be hilarious.

14:07:22
hokudan: DateTime.new!

14:07:23
<transcript>: What happened here? Protocol string care is not implemented. Oh, is a tuple itself? Oh, my goodness.

14:07:23
<transcript>: oh

14:07:26
<transcript>: Oh, my goodness. Natetime. New.

14:07:30
<transcript>: Like that. Do I need to do it on this one, too.

14:07:35
<transcript>: Everything with an exclamation Mark, all of it.

14:07:40
<transcript>: No. I don't think I need to do that one. Maybe not even this one.

14:07:42
<transcript>: This is okay.

14:07:48
<transcript>: So much work.

14:07:51
<transcript>: Kind of do miss typescript if I'm being honest.

14:07:55
<transcript>: It's that type. Safety.

14:07:59
<transcript>: Oh, is it going to work.

14:08:04
<transcript>: It worked. We did it. We finally figured it out.

14:08:07
<transcript>: Oh, man.

14:08:07
<transcript>: daytime

14:08:13
<transcript>: Daytime New thank you, hoka dun, welcome to Chat. Thank you for the tip. We figured it out.

14:08:14
binajmen: good day

14:08:15
<transcript>: Oh, man.

14:08:15
<transcript>: so

14:08:18
<transcript>: So much work. Okay. I wanted to see.

14:08:18
<transcript>: did i

14:08:22
<transcript>: Did I log something suggest error.

14:08:25
<transcript>: I thought I logged.

14:08:28
<transcript>: Something.

14:08:30
<transcript>: What did I log.

14:08:34
<transcript>: Did I not.

14:08:37
<transcript>: You may see a log.

14:08:43
<transcript>: I was logging one of the variables or something, but I don't see it. Oh, maybe we didn't go down that code path.

14:08:48
<transcript>: Right here. Logger with time. I should be logging.

14:08:56
<transcript>: I will put.

14:08:58
<transcript>: That.

14:09:08
<transcript>: Both assists in a game.

14:09:13
jenswoeste: good afternoon adam & chat

14:09:16
<transcript>: Good day. Ben. Adjmin.

14:09:20
<transcript>: Did it do it.

14:09:28
<transcript>: No, unless it's just buried. And I'm not seeing it.

14:09:35
<transcript>: Surely it didn't run this many queries.

14:09:38
<transcript>: Get Pro. Oh, wait. Maybe it did.

14:09:43
<transcript>: Because that was the pro.

14:09:51
<transcript>: Passing the logger is deprecated.

14:09:54
thdxr: jenssss

14:09:59
<transcript>: So there's the query. Oh, yeah, with time. Here we go. 23, four, one. Okay. So that all looks good.

14:10:02
<transcript>: So now I'm going to log the output.

14:10:10
<transcript>: Yens is here. Good afternoon, yens. Good afternoon.

14:10:13
<transcript>: So we're going to do this.

14:10:17
<transcript>: We're going to get user where am I using this.

14:10:17
<transcript>: get

14:10:20
<transcript>: Get user ask count.

14:10:20
<transcript>: right

14:10:24
<transcript>: Right here. We're going to log. Oh, we're already doing it.

14:10:24
<transcript>: really

14:10:26
<transcript>: Really.

14:10:29
<transcript>: Count is logged.

14:10:29
<transcript>: okay

14:10:33
<transcript>: Okay maybe let's do like this.

14:10:38
<transcript>: Let's do count.

14:10:41
<transcript>: And then count.

14:10:45
<transcript>: Let's try that.

14:10:52
<transcript>: Again.

14:10:52
<transcript>: most assists

14:10:54
<transcript>: Most Assists in a game.

14:11:00
<transcript>: Welcome, yens. How are you doing.

14:11:05
<transcript>: Okay, count. We're looking for count.

14:11:07
jokestera_e: I like we had live proof adam is scamming and everyone still tries to redeem the macbook lol

14:11:09
<transcript>: Looking for count.

14:11:12
<transcript>: I guess I could search in here.

14:11:16
<transcript>: Still looking for count.

14:11:18
thdxr: I know

14:11:21
<transcript>: So much log output.

14:11:26
<transcript>: So much. Count eight. Okay, so I've committed. Eight. Queries.

14:11:26
<transcript>: so now

14:11:29
thdxr: more sick pleasure for Adam

14:11:30
<transcript>: So now if I update, watch this.

14:11:36
<transcript>: If I update this to be 25, we should successfully query now right.

14:11:46
<transcript>: I like we had live proof. Adam is scamming, and everyone still tries to redeem the macbook. It wasn't proof. There was no proof.

14:11:46
<transcript>: i was just

14:11:56
<transcript>: I was just surprised because there was no message, because you guys were lying to me. So I was surprised that it didn't work, and it only showed it for you guys. That was surprising. So I was surprised. Okay.

14:11:56
<transcript>: you guys

14:11:59
<transcript>: You guys. Oh, my goodness. Most assists in a game.

14:12:03
ittzsushi: Sure Kappa

14:12:06
<transcript>: It worked, it worked, it worked, it worked.

14:12:10
<transcript>: Okay. Now I'm going to set it to.

14:12:12
thdxr: it was a sting operation not a lie

14:12:13
<transcript>: Ten. I'm going to set it to ten.

14:12:16
<transcript>: Because I want to see it flip over.

14:12:19
<transcript>: It's a sting operation.

14:12:21
maleero: Did someone win?!

14:12:27
<transcript>: Most blocks in a game. This one should work. This should be the 10th query. Oh, no, I have less than ten, so this should fail.

14:12:32
<transcript>: It failed. Okay. So it should be less than or equal to whatever limit I want.

14:12:35
jokestera_e: Tj was undercover the entire time. He was wearing a wire

14:12:38
ittzsushi: @maleero Cuz it's a scam Kappa

14:12:42
<transcript>: But it won't work now because this will actually be our 10th query or no, it won't be our 10th query. This will let us most rebound.

14:12:44
ittzsushi: No*

14:12:44
<transcript>: In a season.

14:12:47
<transcript>: This should work.

14:12:49
<transcript>: Should work.

14:12:52
<transcript>: Right.

14:12:52
<transcript>: yes

14:12:53
<transcript>: Yes.

14:12:53
<transcript>: okay

14:12:56
<transcript>: Okay. That works. Because.

14:13:01
jokestera_e: Yes Teej_Devries

14:13:05
<transcript>: I just did less than or equal to and the last query that failed didn't actually get added to the database, so it didn't count toward their total, right? Yeah.

14:13:10
<transcript>: Tj was undercover the whole time he was wearing a wire.

14:13:16
<transcript>: No ₩1 maliro they're all just messing with me they all had me going pretty good.

14:13:21
<transcript>: They were convincing me pretty hard that I just couldn't see the message.

14:13:25
<transcript>: But I keep every time I talk.

14:13:28
<transcript>: I'm just shooting stuff everywhere.

14:13:28
<transcript>: okay

14:13:35
<transcript>: Okay. This works. The code works. Can I make this cleaner? Could we just do, like.

14:13:39
<transcript>: Could I just do instead of having a very.

14:13:50
<transcript>: Oh, there was a U in there user, and then less than or equal to ten kind of just do that.

14:13:52
<transcript>: Network is this type syntax.

14:13:52
<transcript>: with this

14:13:54
<transcript>: With this like that work.

14:13:56
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:14:03
<transcript>: Is that better? I don't know if it's better. Maybe a little harder to read, actually.

14:14:07
<transcript>: I don't think it's better. Is it better? I feel like people who write.

14:14:07
<transcript>: elixir

14:14:10
<transcript>: Elixir have opinions about stuff like this.

14:14:10
<transcript>: you guys

14:14:12
<transcript>: You guys are like.

14:14:18
<transcript>: Yes, it matters. It matters a lot. Would you do it like this? Or would you do the variable count.

14:14:31
<transcript>: Anybody? Where'd my electric crew go? I put a Likor in the title. You guys are supposed to help me ride elixir.

14:14:33
vapor__dev: wait im back

14:14:35
<transcript>: That's kind of a joke kind of.

14:14:37
vapor__dev: what the question

14:14:41
<transcript>: Alan's Back. What's the question.

14:14:41
<transcript>: alan

14:14:41
thdxr: I'm showering

14:14:45
<transcript>: Alan, would you write it like this on one line where you have the conditional.

14:14:45
<transcript>: daxes

14:14:49
<transcript>: Daxes in the shower. We have a conditional.

14:14:51
<transcript>: Or would you do it like this.

14:14:51
<transcript>: where you have

14:14:55
<transcript>: Where you have a variable name count and then you return.

14:14:55
<transcript>: count

14:15:00
<transcript>: Count less than ten. Which way would you do it? What's the more elixir way to do things.

14:15:03
<transcript>: Anybody have opinions.

14:15:05
thdxr: drop the var

14:15:08
cosmicladyrosa: if you want to follow the community style guide, it says that the first statement in a pipeline shouldn't be piped. but I usually ignore that one cuz i like pipelining

14:15:10
<transcript>: Drop the var. Okay.

14:15:17
<transcript>: Doing it like this.

14:15:27
<transcript>: Okay, so ten queries it will not let you do more than that for free. Now I need to handle the visitor case.

14:15:27
<transcript>: if

14:15:32
thdxr: but also maybe not pooe

14:15:36
<transcript>: If you want to follow the community saga, it says that the first statement in a pipeline shouldn't be piped, but I usually ignore that one because I like pipelining.

14:15:36
thdxr: pipe

14:15:41
<transcript>: No pipe. Oh, yeah, I see what you're saying. I think this shouldn't be.

14:15:41
<transcript>: yeah

14:15:43
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:15:46
<transcript>: I think you're right.

14:15:46
<transcript>: ask

14:15:52
<transcript>: Asks. Get user ask count. User less than ten. That makes way more sense. Okay.

14:15:54
<transcript>: If there's not a user.

14:15:54
<transcript>: okay

14:15:56
<transcript>: Okay.

14:15:58
<transcript>: There's not a user now I need to.

14:15:58
<transcript>: get the

14:16:04
<transcript>: Get the visitor. But the question is, should I do this in the first statement.

14:16:08
thdxr: do you use `dw` in vim

14:16:11
<transcript>: Because now we have a visitor. And I want to get.

14:16:11
<transcript>: user ask

14:16:16
<transcript>: User askcount by Visitor Do you use dw and vim.

14:16:16
<transcript>: delete

14:16:17
<transcript>: Delete word? Yeah.

14:16:22
<transcript>: I do maybe not enough, but I do.

14:16:30
vapor__dev: i only use a pipe if its more than 1 operation

14:16:31
thdxr: just checking, scammers are known to do that

14:16:31
<transcript>: Okay, so visitor now I need to have a get user ask count, but for visitors.

14:16:38
<transcript>: Oh, maybe it shouldn't be get user maybe it should be git ask count and then you pass in a user or a visitor. Yeah.

14:16:42
vapor__dev: @thdxr SeriousSloth

14:16:44
<transcript>: Git ask count and then this will be.

14:16:44
<transcript>: this way

14:16:45
<transcript>: This way.

14:16:47
<transcript>: And then.

14:16:47
<transcript>: we'll

14:16:49
<transcript>: We'll have one for.

14:16:49
<transcript>: visitor

14:16:51
<transcript>: Visitor.

14:16:58
<transcript>: I guess I should do this like a cool way? I should do this a cool way? Shouldn't I.

14:17:00
<transcript>: This is going to be visitor.

14:17:11
<transcript>: This isn't the cool way. I should share all this code somehow these should just be like little light overloads that point.

14:17:11
<transcript>: to like

14:17:15
<transcript>: To like a one that takes in the query something. Maybe.

14:17:18
<transcript>: What do you guys think.

14:17:22
<transcript>: There's a better way to do this.

14:17:22
<transcript>: i only use

14:17:25
gitpush_gitpaid: a cool way? maybe gEt_AsK_cOuNt ?

14:17:25
<transcript>: I only use a pipe if it's more than one operation. Okay.

14:17:26
ferellon: do you use db or do you do bdw when deleting a word if you're starting at the end. Idk why I have an inertia against db primeagenF

14:17:29
<transcript>: Scammers are known to do that. You guys.

14:17:31
<transcript>: Get ask.

14:17:31
<transcript>: count

14:17:37
<transcript>: Count SpongeBob casing. So my question is so here, this will handle the visitor case and.

14:17:39
<transcript>: This will be.

14:17:41
<transcript>: By oh, no.

14:17:43
<transcript>: By visitor.

14:17:52
<transcript>: I'm going to have to make it wait. Does visitor not get. Oh, no. This could be serious. People.

14:17:55
<transcript>: This could be serious.

14:17:57
<transcript>: By user.

14:18:03
<transcript>: Oh, no, this table doesn't do it for visitors only users.

14:18:05
heroictashcan: SERIOUS

14:18:06
<transcript>: Oh no.

14:18:10
<transcript>: That's not what I want.

14:18:10
<transcript>: what do we

14:18:12
<transcript>: What do we do for visitors.

14:18:19
<transcript>: We don't have a table for visitors.

14:18:22
<transcript>: Oh no.

14:18:22
<transcript>: do you

14:18:25
<transcript>: Do you use db or do you.

14:18:25
<transcript>: do

14:18:26
<transcript>: Do.

14:18:26
<transcript>: so

14:18:32
<transcript>: So delete back or do you do back delete word when deleting a word if you're starting at the end.

14:18:34
<transcript>: Inertia against DB.

14:18:40
<transcript>: So I think if I were deleting backward, I think.

14:18:42
<transcript>: I do DB.

14:18:42
<transcript>: should

14:18:44
<transcript>: Should I not.

14:18:49
<transcript>: So if I'm right here I would do db? Yeah.

14:18:55
<transcript>: It's deleting backward. Always feels awkward to me. I probably just don't do the right thing enough.

14:18:55
<transcript>: we got

14:18:57
<transcript>: We got a serious issue here, people.

14:18:57
<transcript>: serious

14:19:05
<transcript>: Serious issue. And that is that we only add records to the Ask users for users.

14:19:05
<transcript>: if

14:19:07
<transcript>: If you haven't logged in.

14:19:07
<transcript>: we're not

14:19:12
<transcript>: We're not storing. I think we store it on the ask itself.

14:19:15
<transcript>: There's like a Visitor ID. Maybe.

14:19:16
dmmulroy: I do diw

14:19:21
<transcript>: See what the schema looks like? Asks, Is there a visitor ID.

14:19:25
<transcript>: Or is there.

14:19:29
<transcript>: Users ask users.

14:19:31
<transcript>: Last visitor.

14:19:39
dmmulroy: that way I can be anywhere in the word

14:19:40
<transcript>: The same question could be asked by multiple visitors.

14:19:43
<transcript>: Oh no.

14:19:50
<transcript>: Delete inward. That wouldn't be anywhere in the word. Yeah, I do that.

14:19:52
<transcript>: For.

14:19:52
<transcript>: yeah like

14:19:59
<transcript>: Yeah. Like if I'm in the middle, like if I'm even at the beginning, if I'm replacing this, I'm doing ciw.

14:20:04
<transcript>: Or if I'm deleting it. Yeah, Di W I definitely do that a lot.

14:20:06
<transcript>: This is not good.

14:20:08
<transcript>: I have to do a lot more work.

14:20:12
<transcript>: A lot more work than I realized.

14:20:15
sockthedev: hey gang, what is this?

14:20:17
<transcript>: I could have sworn that we store.

14:20:17
<transcript>: i could have

14:20:21
<transcript>: I could have sworn we store the visitor ID.

14:20:22
cowfacedev: I need to use b and e more as verbs. those two verbs have no muscle memory for me. Although I get away fine with w and F LUL

14:20:24
<transcript>: On here.

14:20:24
<transcript>: put last

14:20:26
<transcript>: Put last visitor.

14:20:26
<transcript>: apparent

14:20:29
<transcript>: Apparently we do not.

14:20:36
ferellon: @dmmulroy That is cool

14:20:37
<transcript>: Ask event.

14:20:39
<transcript>: An ask event.

14:20:43
<transcript>: Tracking unique asks.

14:20:44
cowfacedev: @sockthedev some sql magic LUL

14:20:48
<transcript>: Okay belongs to visitor. This is good.

14:20:50
<transcript>: Ask event.

14:20:52
<transcript>: What is this.

14:21:00
<transcript>: Pocket. Here.

14:21:01
sockthedev: what language is this? a custom dsl

14:21:11
<transcript>: This is elixir. I need to use B and emor as verbs. Those two verbs have no muscle memory for me, although I get away fine with W and F.

14:21:15
<transcript>: B and E as verbs. I don't know what that means.

14:21:21
<transcript>: Oh, like back. I see. Like when you're deleting something.

14:21:25
<transcript>: As a verb.

14:21:25
sockthedev: i heard elixir is dog water

14:21:29
<transcript>: What do you mean.

14:21:31
sockthedev: 😅

14:21:33
<transcript>: Get away with W, and F.

14:21:37
<transcript>: What language is this.

14:21:42
<transcript>: It is elixir sock. You heard it's. Dog, water.

14:21:42
<transcript>: i mean it doesn't have

14:21:44
cosmicladyrosa: elixir rules

14:21:44
<transcript>: I mean it doesn't have types.

14:21:44
<transcript>: so i guess

14:21:51
<transcript>: So I guess it does belong in the dog water tier. It's pretty cool, though. It's not bad. I don't hate it.

14:21:55
sockthedev: theo's take i think

14:21:55
<transcript>: I do hate that maybe we're not storing the data. I thought we were storing.

14:22:00
<transcript>: Ask event when our Ask events created.

14:22:01
hahacazalbe: !elixir

14:22:03
sockthedev: no, actually prime

14:22:05
<transcript>: Put ask.

14:22:09
i_watch_qt_streamers: are you using liveview?

14:22:10
<transcript>: Change set, so ask.

14:22:10
<transcript>: event

14:22:11
<transcript>: Event.

14:22:14
<transcript>: Change, set.

14:22:19
cosmicladyrosa: yeah it was prime and i got so upset about that i left the stream lmao

14:22:20
standardrobot: o/

14:22:20
<transcript>: What.

14:22:28
<transcript>: Okay. So here we go. Put ectomal.

14:22:35
<transcript>: Ask event what is this about.

14:22:39
<transcript>: Observe with event.

14:22:42
standardrobot: boutta go to work, just thought I'd pop in and say hi

14:22:45
sockthedev: yeah, from what i have heard from elixir fans it sounds rad, so i was surprised myself

14:22:47
<transcript>: Let's start with event.

14:22:47
<transcript>: it's never used

14:22:49
<transcript>: It's never used Oh.

14:22:49
<transcript>: absurd

14:22:53
<transcript>: Absurd with event. I just don't know why.

14:23:00
<transcript>: What does with event mean? Do create.

14:23:00
<transcript>: ask

14:23:01
<transcript>: Ask.

14:23:04
<transcript>: Okay.

14:23:06
<transcript>: With event.

14:23:09
<transcript>: Does that mean.

14:23:13
<transcript>: This event.

14:23:36
<transcript>: Does that explain it at the top, they just ignore it.

14:23:41
<transcript>: Find or Create Ask with Ask event.

14:23:51
<transcript>: Okay. So then finally calls ask upsert with event to return that. Okay.

14:24:04
<transcript>: What do they mean with event? So create Ask submit query to gamma api and upset Ask versus this one with Event true is submit query to gamma api. Upset Ask with Ask event.

14:24:09
<transcript>: I don't understand.

14:24:12
<transcript>: Let's just search for.

14:24:15
<transcript>: Create ask with event.

14:24:19
<transcript>: Here we go.

14:24:26
sockthedev: what plugin gives you the sticky header for the module name etc? that's pretty rad

14:24:31
<transcript>: Okay so create from post that's when you directly query from the query thing.

14:24:36
<transcript>: Is that the only usage here.

14:24:43
<transcript>: Yeah, it's right here. So career from post. Okay. So when you type a message.

14:24:52
<transcript>: A direct query into the query bar and hit enter it always runs. Create askwith event so that Ask event record should always exist.

14:24:54
<transcript>: Okay.

14:24:54
<transcript>: but when

14:25:05
<transcript>: But when you change the url, that's a different thing. Standard robot. Hello, about to go to work. Just thought it pop and say Hello Hello to you. How are you doing? You might already be gone.

14:25:05
<transcript>: but

14:25:07
cowfacedev: treesitter context @sockthedev

14:25:09
<transcript>: But let's see, I heard elixir Zarwater theos take I think.

14:25:09
<transcript>: elix

14:25:12
<transcript>: Elixir, rules.

14:25:15
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Hazel.

14:25:15
<transcript>: welcome

14:25:17
standardrobot: pretty good

14:25:19
<transcript>: Welcome to my Chat. There is no Licture command. Unfortunately.

14:25:33
<transcript>: I watch qt streamers. Welcome to my chat or using Live View. We are not using Live View. I don't think we're using Phoenix. I don't believe we're using Live View. It's a React app embedded in our Phoenix app. We're actually rewriting the whole thing in Astro.

14:25:33
<transcript>: but i've got

14:25:36
<transcript>: But I've got some stuff I got to add to the existing app.

14:25:36
<transcript>: before we

14:25:39
<transcript>: Before we finish the rewrite.

14:25:44
sockthedev: @cowFaceDev tyvm

14:25:57
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah. From what I have heard from elixir, it sounds rad. So I was surprised myself. What plugin? I think they docked it because there's no types. What plugin gives you the sticky header for the module name, et cetera. That's pretty rad. Yeah. Cafe's already got you tree sitter context. He's probably the one that told me about it.

14:26:01
<transcript>: Okay.

14:26:05
<transcript>: So I think I can use this ask thing.

14:26:05
<transcript>: it's

14:26:06
<transcript>: It's unfortunate.

14:26:14
<transcript>: I guess this only matters for visitors for users. Well, they're never going to be users.

14:26:15
cowfacedev: I got it from prime.

14:26:16
<transcript>: It's always going to be visitors.

14:26:16
<transcript>: okay

14:26:17
<transcript>: Okay.

14:26:20
<transcript>: You create.

14:26:20
<transcript>: this

14:26:23
<transcript>: This Ask event record.

14:26:28
<transcript>: Create ask.

14:26:29
hahacazalbe: its a weird language, maybe because im not familiar with functional programming

14:26:33
<transcript>: Okay.

14:26:36
<transcript>: Ask event.

14:26:48
<transcript>: Let's go back in here. Let's see. Ask event.

14:26:54
<transcript>: Where is that.

14:27:02
<transcript>: Auth.

14:27:04
<transcript>: author

14:27:06
<transcript>: Author. Where is that.

14:27:08
<transcript>: Root controller.

14:27:13
<transcript>: Can I minimize something.

14:27:18
<transcript>: Just go through some history. Here.

14:27:21
<transcript>: Create ask.

14:27:31
<transcript>: Oh here, let's do this. Create ask with event no.

14:27:39
<transcript>: Can query so canquery does get current user and then get user ask count. Now for the visitor case I need to do.

14:27:43
<transcript>: Something like this.

14:27:49
<transcript>: But instead of ask users.

14:27:49
cowfacedev: it is not that wierd as compared to some of the lisp stuff

14:27:52
<transcript>: Should I do an ask.

14:27:55
<transcript>: Event, ask event.

14:27:59
standardrobot: what's statmuse about?

14:28:01
<transcript>: Should I just put it on here? Maybe change that.

14:28:06
<transcript>: I just use this asks thing. I think I'm just going to stick it in here.

14:28:12
<transcript>: Get ask count with a visitor is going to do something different. It's going to be.

14:28:12
<transcript>: ask

14:28:13
<transcript>: Ask event.

14:28:20
<transcript>: And I probably don't have by user.

14:28:23
<transcript>: So we need to probably add that.

14:28:28
<transcript>: Let's see git Ask count by user.

14:28:28
<transcript>: this is what

14:28:31
<transcript>: This is what I need to copy.

14:28:34
<transcript>: Both of these.

14:28:40
<transcript>: Stank down here. We're going to go to ask.

14:28:40
<transcript>: vent

14:28:42
<transcript>: Vent.

14:28:46
<transcript>: We have change set now we're also going to have this.

14:28:53
<transcript>: By user oh, no, by visitor.

14:29:02
<transcript>: Okay.

14:29:06
<transcript>: By user by visitor.

14:29:09
<transcript>: Okay.

14:29:12
<transcript>: Visitor.

14:29:15
<transcript>: Visitor ID.

14:29:24
<transcript>: Okay.

14:29:27
<transcript>: Queryable that needs to be.

14:29:34
<transcript>: Visitor ID. I don't know if that's actually on there.

14:29:37
<transcript>: It's not.

14:29:37
<transcript>: ua

14:29:39
<transcript>: Ua we're going to call this.

14:29:39
<transcript>: a

14:29:46
<transcript>: Ae. Hey, it's my initials. Adam lmore. Ae. Ask event.

14:29:46
<transcript>: visit

14:29:52
<transcript>: Visitor ID. Yeah, that's a thing that's on the schema visitor ID. Right.

14:29:53
standardrobot: certified initial moment

14:29:54
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:29:56
<transcript>: Think so.

14:29:57
jokestera_e: They're my initals too

14:29:59
<transcript>: It's a weird language.

14:30:02
<transcript>: Pretty great.

14:30:08
<transcript>: What's Stammy is about standard robot.

14:30:08
<transcript>: status

14:30:09
<transcript>: Status is.

14:30:09
<transcript>: a sports

14:30:11
<transcript>: A sports.

14:30:13
<transcript>: Knowledge base.

14:30:13
<transcript>: we started

14:30:17
standardrobot: :O

14:30:20
<transcript>: We started as like a search box. I mean, it still is a search box, but it's like Google for Sports stats.

14:30:24
standardrobot: ah that's dope

14:30:27
<transcript>: So you just ask questions in English, and you get answers. Sports questions. That's what it is.

14:30:27
<transcript>: they're

14:30:35
<transcript>: They're my initials too. Hey, I just noticed at the end of your name jokester. I was just read jokester and then just stopped reading.

14:30:38
<transcript>: What am I doing here.

14:30:38
<transcript>: by visit

14:30:43
<transcript>: By Visitor. Okay, so by Visitor queryable, visitor, Visitor ID.

14:30:43
<transcript>: query

14:30:45
goodgrandpaa: Still can't believe my friend rt'd a statmuse thing right above your tweet in my feed haha

14:30:47
<transcript>: Queryable Ae visit equals that okay.

14:30:49
<transcript>: Now I can go back over here.

14:30:53
<transcript>: And say, Ask, event.

14:30:55
<transcript>: By visitor.

14:30:57
<transcript>: Visitor.

14:31:00
<transcript>: Okay.

14:31:00
<transcript>: we're last asked

14:31:04
<transcript>: We're last asked at that's not going to be on there. That's not going to be the thing.

14:31:04
<transcript>: should be timestamps oh

14:31:10
<transcript>: Should be timestamps. Oh, no, it is on there. No, this is Ask Users. I want Ask event. Yeah. Here we go.

14:31:17
<transcript>: Query raw visitor timestamp. So we're just going to do inserted at or updated at I don't know.

14:31:19
<transcript>: Probably.

14:31:23
<transcript>: Let's do.

14:31:26
<transcript>: Inserted ad.

14:31:26
goodgrandpaa: What do you store to keep the visitor information up to date and not be cleared upon cache clear?

14:31:31
<transcript>: Changed since reading.

14:31:39
<transcript>: What happened.

14:31:42
<transcript>: Can't save it.

14:31:45
<transcript>: This file has changed.

14:31:48
<transcript>: I guess I'm saving over it. I don't know.

14:31:57
<transcript>: Visitor Visitor options. When is list? Okay, ask event by visitor and then where inserted at what's wrong.

14:32:01
<transcript>: Insert it at greater than all that stuff.

14:32:01
<transcript>: aggregate

14:32:03
<transcript>: Aggregate. Okay. What's wrong.

14:32:07
<transcript>: Multiple times.

14:32:07
<transcript>: lickstril

14:32:11
<transcript>: Lickstril allows defaults to be declared once per definition.

14:32:14
<transcript>: What.

14:32:18
<transcript>: Oh, I can't do default? What.

14:32:21
<transcript>: Do default on options.

14:32:28
<transcript>: If I'm being honest, I'm never using the options.

14:32:35
<transcript>: Not using them.

14:32:35
<transcript>: oh

14:32:37
<transcript>: Oh, I don't need them.

14:32:40
<transcript>: Okay.

14:32:40
sockthedev: doesn't allow polymorphism?

14:32:42
cosmicladyrosa: you just need to add a signature line before both those functions that defines the defaults

14:32:51
<transcript>: It conflicts visitors different than user, though. Does this conflict? You just need to add a signature line before both those functions. It defines the defaults.

14:32:51
<transcript>: oh

14:32:53
<transcript>: Oh okay.

14:32:53
<transcript>: so

14:32:55
<transcript>: So you're saying.

14:33:01
<transcript>: Def get ask count.

14:33:06
<transcript>: And then what.

14:33:12
cosmicladyrosa: def get_ask_count(entity, options \\[])

14:33:16
<transcript>: You're saying good ass count? When is list.

14:33:21
<transcript>: What's happening.

14:33:22
sockthedev: oh god, it's as bad as polymorphism in ts

14:33:23
<transcript>: What is happening.

14:33:33
<transcript>: Def. Okay. Cosmic. You are my friend. Thank you so much.

14:33:35
<transcript>: For helping me get through this.

14:33:38
<transcript>: You're saying I just need to do that.

14:33:44
<transcript>: And then.

14:33:44
<transcript>: actually

14:33:45
cosmicladyrosa: yeah exactly that

14:33:47
<transcript>: Actually, I'm not using options anywhere.

14:33:47
<transcript>: do i still need it

14:33:50
<transcript>: Do I still need it if I don't use options at all.

14:33:50
cosmicladyrosa: and then take the defaults out of the other funcs

14:33:53
cosmicladyrosa: nah

14:34:00
cosmicladyrosa: don't need it if youre not using defaults

14:34:01
<transcript>: Take the defaults out of the other functions, so I don't need it. I just need to remove the options. Okay.

14:34:01
<transcript>: cool

14:34:02
<transcript>: Cool.

14:34:14
<transcript>: Not using defaults. Okay visitor and user. Those are my two cases we've got ask event buy visitor where inserted at greater than that. I think I'm going to go up here and do.

14:34:14
<transcript>: insert it up

14:34:16
<transcript>: Insert it up for this one too.

14:34:21
<transcript>: Or do updated app for both of them.

14:34:26
<transcript>: Okay. So.

14:34:30
<transcript>: Updated that updated at with time. Okay.

14:34:30
<transcript>: there's some redundancy

14:34:33
<transcript>: There's some redundancy here. I'm sure there's like a better way to do this, but.

14:34:37
<transcript>: It's as bad as polymorphism. And TS.

14:34:44
typedreflections: Hello 👋 I hope you're having a good day. I'm in the middle of a boring refactoring at work.

14:34:45
<transcript>: Still can't believe my friend retweet just sent me a thing right above your tweet. My feed. That was crazy.

14:34:51
<transcript>: It really is crazy. What do you store to keep the visitor information up to date and not be cleared upon cash clear? I.

14:34:51
<transcript>: think

14:34:56
<transcript>: Think I'm not sure. Actually. It might be IP address. We have some way of identifying people.

14:35:01
<transcript>: And I don't remember how it's done.

14:35:06
<transcript>: I really don't. I'm not trying to hide our practices. I just don't even know.

14:35:13
goodgrandpaa: No worries :)

14:35:24
<transcript>: Typed reflections welcome to Chat. I hope you're having a good day. I'm in the middle of a boring refactoring at work. Well, I'm glad that you're here with us. We are in the morning or in the middle of a new feature. So it's not a boring refactoring. It's a new feature. We're adding.

14:35:24
<transcript>: two statues

14:35:27
<transcript>: Two statues. Get asked count. Okay.

14:35:29
<transcript>: This works.

14:35:34
<transcript>: Git ask count thank you for the follow type reflections.

14:35:38
<transcript>: Oh, do I not call this.

14:35:41
<transcript>: In the enforcer.

14:35:47
aatishsai: how do you convert general question to a query?

14:35:49
<transcript>: Oh, I renamed it Get, Ask, Count, user.

14:35:50
typedreflections: You're welcome

14:35:53
<transcript>: And then here we do it with visitor.

14:35:54
gitpush_gitpaid: new feature is a weird way of saying pay Kappa

14:36:00
<transcript>: Right.

14:36:05
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:36:12
<transcript>: New features a weird way of saying pay. Yeah, we're adding a paywall. How do you convert general question to a query.

14:36:14
<transcript>: We have.

14:36:14
<transcript>: a whole service

14:36:16
<transcript>: A whole service that we built.

14:36:16
<transcript>: called

14:36:18
<transcript>: Called gamera.

14:36:23
<transcript>: It's a big one. It's a big repository. It's a lot of heuristics.

14:36:23
<transcript>: we do

14:36:34
<transcript>: We do some named entity ml stuff, but mostly it's like a whole bunch of rules that figure out when you type a question. How do we answer that with sports data.

14:36:39
goodgrandpaa: The google of sports, very cool!

14:36:42
<transcript>: Complex. It can handle a whole lot of stuff. There are millions and millions of pages from queries that have been regenerated. What's wrong here.

14:36:46
<transcript>: Get ask count less than ten.

14:36:46
<transcript>: why is that

14:36:48
<transcript>: Why is that? Oh, because we're doing this.

14:36:51
<transcript>: That's why.

14:36:51
<transcript>: okay i

14:36:53
<transcript>: Okay. I think this should work. Now.

14:36:53
<transcript>: the

14:36:56
<transcript>: The Google Sports, Very cool.

14:36:56
<transcript>: yeah

14:36:57
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:36:57
<transcript>: we do finance

14:37:02
<transcript>: We do finance data too. So you can ask questions about stocks and stuff like that.

14:37:04
<transcript>: Okay.

14:37:04
<transcript>: let's see

14:37:05
<transcript>: Let's see.

14:37:09
<transcript>: Let's get rid of some stuff that we're not using.

14:37:15
<transcript>: Whatever.

14:37:15
<transcript>: do

14:37:17
<transcript>: Do I really want to do this right now.

14:37:17
gitpush_gitpaid: wait so if a question is asked and successful you guys generate and save the page?

14:37:21
<transcript>: See if it works.

14:37:27
<transcript>: Let's see if it works. Can query.

14:37:31
<transcript>: So if I go back here and I log out.

14:37:34
raondev: i like it that you can ask it in an natural language

14:37:37
<transcript>: Off Sign out.

14:37:41
<transcript>: Should be signed out.

14:37:49
<transcript>: Yeah. You can ask in actual language. So we do really well in, like alexa and Google Assistant. Well, we did when those came out. We got a lot of questions.

14:37:49
<transcript>: most

14:37:52
<transcript>: Most points in a game.

14:37:54
<transcript>: Okay.

14:37:54
<transcript>: why did it

14:37:58
<transcript>: Why did it do this, though? Did it actually let's see.

14:37:58
<transcript>: let's do

14:38:00
<transcript>: Let's do this.

14:38:04
<transcript>: Count equals.

14:38:08
<transcript>: And then I o put.

14:38:20
<transcript>: See if it's getting it right.

14:38:27
<transcript>: Most assists.

14:38:27
<transcript>: in

14:38:29
<transcript>: In a game.

14:38:34
<transcript>: If it knows what visitor. I am, uhoh, what happened.

14:38:38
<transcript>: I broke something.

14:38:41
<transcript>: Count.

14:38:44
<transcript>: Oh, it doesn't have a there we go.

14:38:48
<transcript>: Okay.

14:39:02
<transcript>: Wait. So if a question is asked and successful, you guys generate and save the page. That's right. Git push. We save questions.

14:39:12
<transcript>: And then we also just pre generate a whole bunch of questions. So if you ask on Google, just ask a sports question.

14:39:18
gitpush_gitpaid: what about unsuccessful questions?

14:39:25
<transcript>: Like most touchdowns in a game just like ask questions and status will be up there one or two on almost any kind of sports question you can think of. Let's touch the game by single player.

14:39:27
<transcript>: It just takes you to a page like this.

14:39:27
<transcript>: so we get

14:39:35
<transcript>: So we get like a million inbounds from Google seo a day. So every day, like a million people hit stat muse from asking questions on Google.

14:39:35
<transcript>: we do a lot

14:39:38
<transcript>: We do a lot of traffic through Google.

14:39:38
<transcript>: and that's why

14:39:43
<transcript>: And that's why because we have millions and millions of sports questions that are just pages.

14:39:43
<transcript>: what about un

14:39:47
<transcript>: What about unsuccessful questions? No, those don't get indexed.

14:39:49
<transcript>: Yeah. Those don't.

14:39:52
anitrogen: and theres a site for every question?

14:39:55
<transcript>: Okay. What was I doing? Most points.

14:39:55
anitrogen: in statmuse?

14:39:57
<transcript>: In a game.

14:40:02
<transcript>: There's a site for every question there's a page, yeah, there's a page for.

14:40:02
<transcript>: every

14:40:06
<transcript>: Every question I'll show you here in a second.

14:40:11
<transcript>: Did it log the thing that I asked it to log.

14:40:14
<transcript>: Is how much log output when we hit.

14:40:14
<transcript>: pro it does

14:40:17
<transcript>: Pro. It does a bunch of new stuff.

14:40:21
<transcript>: Pro. Where is it.

14:40:28
<transcript>: All.

14:40:28
<transcript>: i'm not seeing

14:40:29
<transcript>: I'm not seeing.

14:40:31
coolpantstv: @adamdotdev you passed it, it was there

14:40:31
<transcript>: The stuff.

14:40:32
coolpantstv: 22

14:40:36
<transcript>: Why do I not see it.

14:40:40
<transcript>: Did I skip over it.

14:40:40
aatishsai: that a whole lot of traffic so what the revenue model, or are you burning money out of pocket?

14:40:46
<transcript>: Get pro. Okay, so there's pro. Now I'm looking for.

14:40:54
<transcript>: Some custom log output right there. Visitor ask count 22. All right. Feels good. So my visitor.

14:41:00
<transcript>: I've asked 22 questions before I logged in cool.

14:41:00
<transcript>: you pass

14:41:08
<transcript>: You pass it. It was there. Thank you. Cool Pants. 22. That's a whole lot of traffic. So what the revenue model? Or are you burning money out of pocket? So atish.

14:41:18
<transcript>: Today we run like there's some ads. We just did this video ad deal with tsn. They're like the ESPN of Canada. In fact, they're owned by ESPN.

14:41:22
<transcript>: So this video ad deal.

14:41:22
<transcript>: it's actually

14:41:26
<transcript>: It's actually a lot of money we make off just this stupid video, ad.

14:41:31
<transcript>: So that's one thing we've been doing, because we get a lot of traffic.

14:41:31
<transcript>: so we do

14:41:36
<transcript>: So we do just monetize your ads, but what I'm building right now, literally, what you're watching me do.

14:41:36
<transcript>: is

14:41:42
<transcript>: Is we're going to add a paywall for people who search like over 100 queries a month.

14:41:42
<transcript>: there's something like

14:41:50
<transcript>: There's something like 80,000 people that do over 100 searches on stat muse each month. They're mostly like, Sports, betters sports journalists.

14:41:52
<transcript>: Fantasy players.

14:41:52
<transcript>: it's not just like

14:42:04
<transcript>: It's not just like people who want to know about sports. There's some of that. But there's also a lot of people that use statues for their work, like for their research. And we want to take that cohort the people who use it for their job.

14:42:04
<transcript>: or

14:42:15
<transcript>: Or they make money from sports betting or whatever. Or it's a hobby of theirs. We want to take those people that do over 100 queries a month and say, okay, you got to pay us for more than 100 querys a month. That's the idea.

14:42:18
<transcript>: So what we're working on right now, it's literally what I'm building.

14:42:18
<transcript>: as

14:42:20
<transcript>: As we speak.

14:42:21
anitrogen: like a premium subscription?

14:42:27
<transcript>: Okay so can query we get the user. If there is a user, we get their ask count.

14:42:32
<transcript>: There's still a to do here to do.

14:42:34
<transcript>: If paid user.

14:42:38
2dorkstv: are you into sports stats yourself, or did you just come up with a rad idea and the data was fun to look at?

14:42:43
<transcript>: Allow. Right. So if the user there'll be certain properties on the user like it's a paid account. If that's the case, just always return true.

14:42:43
<transcript>: because

14:42:49
coolpantstv: How do you guys id a visitor?

14:42:52
<transcript>: Because they get unlimited queries or whatever. Yeah. Like a premium subscription. And we're going to give them other tools, too. We're going to build some stuff specifically for people who use that news for research.

14:43:00
<transcript>: To hopefully give them more value out of subscription, but for now it's just going to be, hey, help us stay sustainable.

14:43:00
<transcript>: the

14:43:08
<transcript>: The ad revenue is nice, but we'd like to disable ads and have people that pay for sat mews. I think that's a better model.

14:43:14
<transcript>: Are you into sports stats yourself, or did you just come up with a rad idea and the data was fun to look at. No.

14:43:14
<transcript>: eli

14:43:21
<transcript>: Eli, My cofounder and I were big sports fans. I'm less so now, Ironically, I think statin has kind of burnt me out a little bit. We got to do a lot of cool.

14:43:21
<transcript>: i'm going to

14:43:23
<transcript>: I'm going to go over here and take a break.

14:43:23
<transcript>: we

14:43:26
<transcript>: We have to do a lot of cool.

14:43:26
<transcript>: sports

14:43:28
<transcript>: Sports Fan Things When we started.

14:43:28
<transcript>: sat mews

14:43:45
gitpush_gitpaid: @2DorksTV adam woulda went pro if coach put him in the 4th quarter.

14:43:48
<transcript>: Sat Mews literally, like, three months. I built a prototype for three months, and we put it on the Internet. We put it on Twitter and NBA Twitter kind of found it. And this video just went viral within those circles. Within, like, 24 hours. We had emails from the League, from tons of teams, analytics departments, all kinds of journalists and SP.

14:43:48
<transcript>: sports

14:43:49
<transcript>: Sports.

14:43:49
<transcript>: just like

14:43:55
aatishsai: also what is the data source, are you scrapping or do you have connections with sports league to provide you data?

14:43:55
standardrobot: nice

14:43:58
daglee: I'm a esport fan! I can slack at statmus! I mean work! Darn it ;)

14:43:59
2dorkstv: ha! @gitpush_gitpaid

14:44:03
<transcript>: Just like they wanted access to the private beta. And literally, like, 48 hours after we put that video on the Internet, we were on a plane to Cleveland. We got to watch the Cleveland cavaliers home opener when lebron James came back from Miami. It was amazing.

14:44:03
<transcript>: we

14:44:08
<transcript>: We got to sit in the owner's box and sit down on the floor next to lebron's kids.

14:44:08
<transcript>: it was just

14:44:10
vapor__dev: dude i want your life

14:44:16
<transcript>: It was just an incredible experience. That was like, literally, right after we made it. We made, like a dumb prototype, put it on the Internet, and we were just being.

14:44:20
<transcript>: Swept away with all this crazy attention.

14:44:24
<transcript>: Then, Dan gilbert, who's the owner of cavs fluent to Detroit.

14:44:24
<transcript>: to talk

14:44:28
standardrobot: adam became one of lebron's children

14:44:32
2dorkstv: oh dang, that sounds like a blast

14:44:35
standardrobot: adam dot james

14:44:37
<transcript>: To talk about how we could build stuff for quicken. He just wanted to use this technology for all this stuff, but he didn't know that it was just like two guys sitting in the ozarks. We weren't like a team yet. We had just like three months building it, so it didn't work out.

14:44:37
<transcript>: but

14:44:45
<transcript>: But it was a really cool experience. We had all kinds of other cool experiences. Like meeting athletes. We recorded a bunch of football players in the studio.

14:44:45
<transcript>: and

14:45:02
<transcript>: And we used their voice to answer questions about their career. So if you ask, like, alexa, who had the most touchdown passes in the season, peyton Manning comes on, he's like, this is peyton Manning. I had first to five touchdowns in the season or whatever. So we did, like that kind of stuff. Met all kinds of our sports heroes.

14:45:05
<transcript>: But yeah, used to be a huge sports fan.

14:45:05
<transcript>: less of

14:45:16
gitpush_gitpaid: were you worried at all about scraping the NBA and them asking where youre getting your data? lots of companies hate that stuff

14:45:25
<transcript>: Less of these days. I think after five years of just like being so heavily invested in stat muse kind of burn out on sports and was just kind of done with the sports industry coming back to it. Now it's a little easier to be excited about it because I haven't been in it so hard for the last three years. And I'm probably more of like a football fan now.

14:45:25
<transcript>: weirdly

14:45:30
<transcript>: Weirdly because I used to not really care about the NFL or American football.

14:45:30
<transcript>: i was really more

14:45:32
<transcript>: I was really more into the NBA.

14:45:32
<transcript>: but then patrick

14:45:40
<transcript>: But then Patrick mahomes, I live in Missouri, like the Chief, my dad was a huge is a Chief huge cheese fan and always has been.

14:45:40
<transcript>: and so

14:45:50
<transcript>: And so I've always been a cheese fan. But they weren't ever very good. And then Patrick mahones came into the NFL, and he's amazing. And it's fun to watch him. So I kind of gotten into them in the last few years anyway.

14:45:50
<transcript>: i realized

14:45:53
gitpush_gitpaid: confirmed. adam is a bandwagoner.

14:45:55
<transcript>: I realized I was not reading chat. Just talking. I'm going to read chat. Now.

14:45:55
<transcript>: adam

14:46:03
<transcript>: Adam, how do you guys idea? Visitor? I don't remember. Cool pants. I need to look. I think it might be some combination of IP address and something.

14:46:03
<transcript>: i don't know

14:46:05
<transcript>: I don't know I'll look.

14:46:05
<transcript>: adam

14:46:09
<transcript>: Adam would have went pro if coach put him in the fourth quarter. So.

14:46:14
<transcript>: Eli and I were both co captains of our high school basketball team.

14:46:22
standardrobot: wait adam how tall are you

14:46:27
<transcript>: So I played sports in high school. In fact, I didn't know anything about computers. In high school. I didn't touch computers or care about computers. I mean, I got on our Compact Prosario to get on aol and talk to my friends.

14:46:27
<transcript>: but

14:46:38
<transcript>: But didn't really take interest in computers or computer science until College. In high school, I was like a high school quarterback. I was actually like I won a bunch of awards. I was actually pretty good.

14:46:38
<transcript>: i'm pretty

14:46:41
<transcript>: I'm pretty big, so I'm six foot four.

14:46:41
<transcript>: i

14:46:46
2dorkstv: I loved my compaq presario :D

14:46:51
nexxeln: what the f

14:46:54
endingwithali: meow

14:46:55
nexxeln: 6'4???

14:46:55
standardrobot: that's like 6-foot-4 cm

14:47:00
<transcript>: I don't know what that is in centimeters or whatever, but I'm a pretty big guy in high school. I was, like, 210, and I was shredded. And I was a pretty hard guy to tackle. So I played football. I played basketball. I pitched in baseball one year, I think my freshman year. No, I don't know. Yeah. My freshman year, I played baseball. And then I was just kind of done with three sports.

14:47:01
nexxeln: 4 feet

14:47:04
<transcript>: Yeah. I was big into sports growing up.

14:47:04
<transcript>: okay

14:47:05
<transcript>: Okay.

14:47:05
<transcript>: what is the data source

14:47:10
endingwithali: HI STANDARD

14:47:11
<transcript>: What is the data source? Are you scraping or do you have connections with sports leagues to provide your data? So.

14:47:11
<transcript>: we have

14:47:11
endingwithali: <3

14:47:12
<transcript>: We have.

14:47:12
<transcript>: a very

14:47:19
<transcript>: A very comprehensive historical sports database that we licensed from a guy named Justin Tobacco. He worked at Sat muse for five years.

14:47:19
<transcript>: he was our

14:47:21
<transcript>: He was our head statistician.

14:47:36
tropichana: Is there soccer stats on statmuse?

14:47:36
<transcript>: He built basketballreference.com. He's like the world's leading sports historian, data collector guy. So he worked at savvy's for five years. We get our real time data from sport radar. We used to I don't know if that's still who we get real time stuff from.

14:47:45
<transcript>: I'm an Esports fan. I can slack at status. I mean, work done. It. Oh, yeah. You know the story we we were going to build.

14:47:47
gitpush_gitpaid: brag more while youre at it "yea i was the captain of everything and didnt care about computers, switched to that and built one of the most famous sports sites on the web. no big deal"

14:47:48
<transcript>: Statues For League of Legends.

14:47:48
<transcript>: and dota

14:47:49
kauai_life: https://imgur.com/DtuO9uZ

14:47:56
<transcript>: And dota and we had we hired this Esports expert to build out the database because we needed good data to build this experience.

14:48:09
<transcript>: And he just ended up playing video games all day. And he never actually built our database. He was at sammy's for a few months, and then we realized, oh, he's not actually working. He's just really obsessed with playing video games, so didn't work out.

14:48:09
<transcript>: alan you

14:48:11
<transcript>: Alan, you.

14:48:11
<transcript>: want my life

14:48:15
<transcript>: Want my life. I don't know. I'm probably making it sound better than it is.

14:48:15
<transcript>: became

14:48:19
<transcript>: Became one of lebron's children.

14:48:19
<transcript>: adam j

14:48:21
<transcript>: Adam James. That's funny.

14:48:21
<transcript>: were you

14:48:25
endingwithali: i actually have a good esports connect if you want to restart that project

14:48:26
goodgrandpaa: he was gathering the data! Kappa

14:48:30
endingwithali: he's a former apple pm

14:48:41
<transcript>: Were you worried at all about scraping the NBA and them asking where you're getting your data? Lots of companies hate that stuff. I think we were worried a little bit, but really, we scraped nba.com just to get something off the ground. We knew we were going to have to do something better. We'd have to license data from Stats LLC or one of the other sport data companies. We knew we'd end up doing that. We just.

14:48:41
<transcript>: kind of wanted

14:48:50
<transcript>: Kind of wanted to see, could we build the technology? So we scraped the database, kind of knowing it was temporary. If that makes sense, Adam is a bandwagoner. It's true.

14:48:56
<transcript>: Wait, Adam, how tall are you? I'm six foot four in inches. Feet, and inches.

14:48:56
<transcript>: love my compact

14:48:59
<transcript>: Love my Compact for sario. Yeah. That was our first computer.

14:49:02
standardrobot: HI ALI

14:49:04
<transcript>: That's like six foot 4 CM.

14:49:18
standardrobot: ok adam you may be 6'4 but ali's like 8'5

14:49:24
<transcript>: Is there soccer stats on Set music? Not yet. We've talked about adding European Soccer epl, maybe La liga. We're going to add IPL eventually. Cricket stats. We know there's just a whole lot of people around the world that could love stat muse if we would open up some of those sports brag, more.

14:49:24
<transcript>: while you

14:49:28
endingwithali: i am too tall :'(

14:49:35
nexxeln: i love watching ipl, watching ipl right now!

14:49:36
<transcript>: While you're at it. Yeah, I was a captain of everything and didn't care about computers, switched to that and built one of the most famous sports sites on the Internet. No big deal. I'm not trying to brag. I have had a kind of cool life.

14:49:36
<transcript>: i mean for like being

14:49:39
<transcript>: I mean for like being from the Osarks. I get to say this because.

14:49:40
standardrobot: she's the star of tall girl

14:49:45
<transcript>: I don't know. I grew up without we didn't have anything growing up. Like my dad worked for the state.

14:49:45
<transcript>: we weren't like

14:49:53
<transcript>: We weren't like doing well in terms of finances. We like paycheck to paycheck. Growing up, I live in a very impoverished area in the us.

14:49:53
<transcript>: so

14:49:57
<transcript>: So now that I've kind of made it, it's nice to talk about it a little bit.

14:49:57
<transcript>: i

14:50:00
<transcript>: I don't know I don't come from money.

14:50:00
<transcript>: i'm

14:50:02
<transcript>: I'm not what are they called.

14:50:04
endingwithali: woof

14:50:08
goodgrandpaa: All of those things create seeds of imposter syndrome haha

14:50:10
endingwithali: my life is so hard because i am too tall :'(

14:50:12

14:55:31

14:55:55
<transcript>: Why is my chat cut off? I can't read the beginning of chat.

14:55:55

14:56:26
<transcript>: I think I know what you guys are talking about. I think I actually know the type. I'm thinking of somebody in particular. I think I know the type of person you're talking about. And I agree. I think it's not helpful. I think the kind of people you're talking about, that behavior not helpful.

14:56:29
<transcript>: I just assume everybody.

14:56:32
<transcript>: How do I want to put this.

14:56:47
binajmen: how many hours do you sleep per day? like, if you were up at ~3am, I suppose you don't sleep that much.

14:56:53
<transcript>: I think I give people the benefit out. Mostly I get upset about things and I get worked up over, like right now, just the whole web Dev culture. I feel like there's some problems, but I don't fault individuals. And mostly I don't fault individuals for anything. I just assume we're all I don't know. Maybe someone can tell me what this is, what this belief is. But we're all just a product.

14:56:53
<transcript>: of

14:57:01
thechosenone1080: humans are to blame

14:57:03
<transcript>: Of everything, our environment, our entire life to this point and that most people just make decisions based on that. And I have a hard time like faulting anybody for anything.

14:57:03
<transcript>: sometimes

14:57:07
thechosenone1080: all my homies hate humans

14:57:08

gitpush_gitpaid: you know dax is just sitting there just laughing while adam tries to navigate land mines about race relations MaxLOL

14:57:19
<transcript>: I don't think they're bad at the core. I just assume that's how they were. That's what they've sort of their life has led them to this moment. They made some bad choices. Sure we all do.

14:57:19
<transcript>: but probably

14:57:19
goodgrandpaa: Yep! @gitpush_gitpaid LUL

14:57:29
<transcript>: But probably the way they view the world is for a reason. It's because of the way they've been positioned in the world. I don't know. Does that make sense, sir, this is a wendy's. It's funny.

14:57:33
typedreflections: @adamdotdev that's called being a normal human LUL

14:57:36
2dorkstv: @typedreflections oh for sure! I think I understand what people are after when they bring it up though

14:57:36

That happens. Some nights are just like Christmas morning, and I just can't sleep anymore because I want to get up and work on this thing that I'm working on. You know what I mean.

15:01:21
<transcript>: Like qubits, and whatever. I just thought it'd be interesting. What I wanted to do was make a to do app with the quantum computer because you can use aws bracket to do quantum simulations. And I thought, how funny would it be to do.
