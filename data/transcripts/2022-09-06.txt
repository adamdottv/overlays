<transcript>: Of theofame.

00:12:26
<transcript>: And mostly I wanted to I wanted to play with TRPC and also to lesser extent, Prisma and SQL databases.

00:12:31
<transcript>: So the T three sacks seemed like a good place to start.

00:12:31
<transcript>: and

00:12:35
<transcript>: And we needed something to build, right? We have to build something.

00:12:35
<transcript>: to like

00:12:38
<transcript>: To like explore the framework.

00:12:38
<transcript>: or

00:12:45
<transcript>: Or the collection of technologies. That is, the T three stack. Explore the stack that's the word stack.

00:12:46
cowfacedude99: So... Ready for tmux crash course?

<transcript>: With a window manager. I knew this about Team X. It's like a way to have, like, tabs inside your one terminal.

00:18:20
<transcript>: oh i can ex

00:18:23
<transcript>: Oh, I can exit via exit. Okay.

00:18:25
<transcript>: T. Max.

00:18:25
<transcript>: so i'm in a thing

00:18:29

<transcript>: I still have sessions.

00:18:31
<transcript>: yes

00:18:32
<transcript>: Yes.

00:18:35
<transcript>: Okay.

00:18:37
<transcript>: Hello.

00:18:37
<transcript>: i made

00:18:42
cowfacedude99: you can attach via tmux a

00:18:44
<transcript>: I made a poppy Neovan plugin that works like BS code live OVs code live server. What? That sounds cool.

00:19:01
<transcript>: You can attach via tmux. A. Okay. So I can attach to the previously. Okay. So let's do something in this window so I can just list and then let's exit and then let's go. I want to see my sessions again. No server running.

00:19:01
<transcript>: uhoh

00:19:02
<transcript>: Uhoh.

00:19:07
<transcript>: Oh, so when you exit.

00:19:07
<transcript>: it

00:19:09
<transcript>: It. It actually kills that session.

00:19:21
<transcript>: Okay, so if I do T Max a it's gonna say there is no session. Cia Tmax list inside this one. There we go. We got some stuff. And now we're gonna say.

00:19:25
<transcript>: Control? What was it? Deposit control.

00:19:25
<transcript>: b

00:19:27
<transcript>: B, and then D.

00:19:30
cowfacedude99: If you detach, the session stays

00:19:31
<transcript>: Just like that. We detached.

00:19:31
<transcript>: okay

00:19:34
<transcript>: Okay, so now I can tuck list sessions.

00:19:34
<transcript>: there's my

00:19:37
<transcript>: There's my window. If I go back into that one.

00:19:49
<transcript>: There it is. There's my history. Okay. Yeah. If you detach the session States. Okay, so I don't love control B. Control D. Why is this or I did hit the be key all of a sudden.

00:19:55
<transcript>: What finger do? I used to hit B. So I used my left drummer. It's right in the middle, you know.

00:19:59
<transcript>: So Control B, control D is actually quite hard.

00:19:59
<transcript>: i guess

00:20:04
<transcript>: I guess it's not a common thing I'll do let's get some keycasts are going.

00:20:04
<transcript>: there we go

00:20:53
<transcript>: Wonder if it's already exist.

00:21:03
<transcript>: There's some logs. Oh, I'm in. Where am I? No.

00:21:11
<transcript>: Okay. So if I do.

00:21:16
<transcript>: So maybe I don't have a config yet. I have to create it.

00:21:23
<transcript>: Has like some theming clearly there's like a green thing at the bottom.

00:21:23
<transcript>: i

<transcript>: so

00:21:33
<transcript>: So how does that work? So if I'm in.

00:21:39
<transcript>: I'm in? Let's say I'm in my overlays project? I'm not gonna work in the overlays. Calm down.

<transcript>: Switch prefix to control a that sounds good.

00:26:23
<transcript>: thank you so much

00:26:26
<transcript>: Thank you so much, Linus, for the follow. I appreciate that.

00:26:26
<transcript>: a bit about

00:26:28
<transcript>: A bit about the terminology.

00:26:30
<transcript>: Okay.

00:26:33
<transcript>: Cow face is Boston Merry.

00:26:35
<transcript>: Some key mucks.

00:26:35
<transcript>: love it

00:26:37
<transcript>: Love it.

00:26:39
<transcript>: T mixes life.

00:26:39
<transcript>: saturation

00:26:43
<transcript>: Saturation wow, people really love T Bucks.

00:26:49
<transcript>: Okay.

00:26:55
<transcript>: Oh, why do I want to use too much.

00:27:09
<transcript>: Okay.

00:27:18
<transcript>: So tumks creating new session attaching and detaching a session.

00:27:18
<transcript>: prefix

00:27:20
<transcript>: Prefix.

00:27:23
<transcript>: Plus D? What's prefix.

00:27:28
<transcript>: Prefix.

00:27:35
cowfacedude99: prefix is c-b for you now

00:27:37
<transcript>: Oh, well, there's a prefix. I don't see any prefix. Human keyboard the previous key can be anything you want. Many TMX shortcuts require you to press a prefix key first.

00:27:37
<transcript>: similar to concept

00:27:49
<transcript>: Similar to concept leader key, but shouldn't probably be the same as my leader key, right? Think of it like a key to signal Tux that you're executing a T Max command by default. Tmux users control B. Oh, that's what gets remapped to control A. Got it.

00:27:49
<transcript>: each

00:27:52
<transcript>: Each time you see prefix means Scroll B. Okay.

00:27:55
<transcript>: Okay.

00:28:00
<transcript>: To attach from the terminal. Run teamks. Attach tmux. Detach.

00:28:17
<transcript>: With too much you can liberally generate as many sessions as you need. Right now we have only one session running to generate more sessions. You first need to be on a regular tournament, not inside of session this time though, let's give our session a name. Okay, so you can new.

00:28:20
<transcript>: Breakfast.

00:28:20
<transcript>: i'll

00:28:23
<transcript>: I'll turn over both command is new session.

00:28:35
<transcript>: Okay, while you're inside the breakfast, I should recall that we also have the original session running, see a little sessions and travel between sessions. Prefix S. Okay.

00:28:40
<transcript>: So we need to remap. We need to do all this. Let's save this file.

00:28:47
<transcript>: Does this just automatically get picked up? Do I need to like restart T mix? I don't know team up.

00:28:51
<transcript>: Cb for me. Yeah, yeah, okay.

00:28:51
<transcript>: so if

00:28:53
<transcript>: So if I want to.

00:28:57
cowfacedude99: You need to restart it now,

00:29:01
<transcript>: Exit this session. I forgot already. It should be control a now and then or just exit.

00:29:01
<transcript>: exit

00:29:03
<transcript>: Exit. I'm out.

00:29:03
<transcript>: so

00:29:05
cj_crew: Hey, how's it going

00:29:06
<transcript>: So if I wanted to tmux list.

00:29:09
<transcript>: Is that and then.

00:29:14
<transcript>: Pmux new and I can name sessions so tmux.

00:29:15
<transcript>: New.

00:29:15
<transcript>: schema

00:29:18
<transcript>: Schema config so meta.

00:29:21
<transcript>: Okay.

00:29:24
cowfacedude99: next time you can do prefix + r to reload config

00:29:24
<transcript>: So I'm in T? Maxx config.

00:29:24
<transcript>: here

00:29:25
<transcript>: Here. And if I do.

00:29:25
<transcript>: leader

00:29:27
<transcript>: Leader s.

00:29:31
<transcript>: No.

00:29:33
<transcript>: Maybe my.

00:29:33
<transcript>: yeah okay

00:29:39
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. So my leader key is a three math yet, and it's gonna show me.

00:29:39
<transcript>: it looks like thirty guys

00:29:40
laytanl_: hey Adam adamel4Animadam

00:29:41
<transcript>: It looks like 30 guys.

00:29:44
<transcript>: I'm using J and K to go back and forth.

00:29:48
<transcript>: Tx. Config. And then what is this.

00:29:53
<transcript>: I do have two of them going right now, so here's the other one. Okay.

00:29:53
<transcript>: exit

00:29:54
<transcript>: Exit.

00:29:54
<transcript>: and then

00:29:59
<transcript>: And then now I only have one running. Yeah, yeah. T Max Config. Okay.

00:30:03
<transcript>: So what do I do to reload the config? I wonder.

00:30:07
urobeat: tmux kill-server

00:30:07
<transcript>: Hey, laden.

00:30:11
<transcript>: Need to restart it now. Okay.

00:30:17
<transcript>: Hey CJ, it's going well how are you next time you can do prefix plus R to reload config team.

00:30:19
<transcript>: Thank you so much.

00:30:22
<transcript>: Timo.

00:30:24
<transcript>: Server.

00:30:31
<transcript>: Learning stuff on Twitch is so much easier than what learning it alone. Just saying, okay, so now if I do.

00:30:37
<transcript>: T Max list no server running. I got a start. Team up like that.

00:30:37
<transcript>: there we are

00:30:40
<transcript>: There we are no current window.

00:30:49
<transcript>: By the task that.

00:30:56
<transcript>: Was on no current window nonsense tmux. A. For attached.

00:30:56
cowfacedude99: that's why you start building your config incrementally LUL

00:30:58
<transcript>: Like, what is this about.

00:30:58
<transcript>: no current window

00:31:00
<transcript>: No current window.

00:31:02
<transcript>: This a plugin or something. I just added.

00:31:02
<transcript>: let's get

00:31:04
<transcript>: Let's get out of here.

00:31:11
<transcript>: Control. A. D. Nope. Control. Ad. Okay.

00:31:16
<transcript>: Let's do Inv.

00:31:18
<transcript>: inventory

00:31:19
<transcript>: Inventory.

00:31:30
<transcript>: I can do control R. So you start building your config incrementally. Yeah. I don't know what else in here. I should probably know.

00:31:30
<transcript>: set window

00:31:35
<transcript>: Set window option so the vote okay so vim style movement is here.

00:31:40
<transcript>: Then style through resizing.

00:31:42
<transcript>: Then sell through windows.

00:31:45
<transcript>: Control. H.

00:31:48
<transcript>: How does how I read that.

00:31:52
<transcript>: Paint.

00:32:09
<transcript>: Okay, so default terminal screen to the color. What is this about.

00:32:12
<transcript>: I'm just kind of bouncing around.

00:32:12
<transcript>: so

00:32:14
<transcript>: So.

00:32:19
<transcript>: We switched it to CA, which we like.

00:32:21
<transcript>: Unbind CB.

00:32:21
<transcript>: and

00:32:22
cowfacedude99: that is to make sure that colors are proper

00:32:24
<transcript>: And then what else.

00:32:34
<transcript>: Make sure that colors are proper. Yeah, just it shouldn't be X term 256 or something. I've seen that places, but.

00:32:39
<transcript>: Repeat time. Default is 500 ml.

00:32:44
<transcript>: Okay. So they're making a slower repeat time.

00:32:44
<transcript>: you maximize

00:32:47
laytanl_: What are we drinking today?

00:32:48
<transcript>: You maximize a lot of control. Sounds like Tmax influence is a lot of things.

00:32:51
<transcript>: So this TX lesson Two, one.

00:32:54
<transcript>: Now need that stuff. Apparently.

00:32:54
<transcript>: mouse on

00:32:55
<transcript>: Mouse on.

00:32:58
<transcript>: Okay. Remove. Delay.

00:32:58
<transcript>: set

00:33:03
<transcript>: Set window pane INEX to start at one. Is this why I was getting that air? I think so.

00:33:03
<transcript>: i do

00:33:05
<transcript>: I do believe so.

00:33:08
<transcript>: Maybe not that Space index.

00:33:22
<transcript>: Like I should comment some stuff out. What do we drink in today? Leighton? We're drinking water.

00:33:28
<transcript>: But I'm kind of wishing I had some Danny blend already.

00:33:35
<transcript>: Why, why.

00:33:38
<transcript>: Is Tmax.

00:33:40
<transcript>: Saying no current window.

00:33:42
<transcript>: Next. Comp.

00:33:45
<transcript>: No crime.

00:33:45
<transcript>: window

00:33:46
<transcript>: Window.

00:33:54
laytanl_: your wishing for what?

00:33:55
<transcript>: You don't have G on that second, so it needs a window to set the option on, but no windows exist yet.

00:34:01
<transcript>: G.

00:34:04
<transcript>: On that set command.

00:34:05
urobeat: whats on like 54?

00:34:05
<transcript>: Okay.

00:34:05
<transcript>: let's see if we

00:34:07
laytanl_: you're

00:34:07
cowfacedude99: can you show the config?

00:34:08
<transcript>: Let's see if we can figure that out.

00:34:09
urobeat: line*

00:34:11
<transcript>: And then.

00:34:15
<transcript>: Oh Gee don't have G on that set command.

00:34:15
<transcript>: that

00:34:19
<transcript>: That set, set, set, set, set. There's G's on all these.

00:34:24
<transcript>: Window option. I don't see a G on this one.

00:34:29
<transcript>: Just pretending I know what I'm doing if someone has a better idea.

00:34:29
<transcript>: i can

00:34:33
<transcript>: I can do that. Better idea. Okay. Control. R.

00:34:33
<transcript>: almost

00:34:36
<transcript>: Almost at newest already at News change.

00:34:44
laytanl_: don't we all pretend

00:34:44
<transcript>: You see, I bound R. Oh, I have to control A. And then R.

00:34:44
<transcript>: no

00:34:45
cowfacedude99: You are not inside tmux

00:34:46
<transcript>: No.

00:34:51
<transcript>: Can you show the yeah cafes? Do you see this.

00:34:54
<transcript>: See this.

00:34:54
<transcript>: what's online

00:34:57
<transcript>: What's Online? 54.

00:35:03
<transcript>: I'm wishing Leighton that I had my Dandy blend, which is like my fake coffee. It's a tea.

00:35:03
<transcript>: it tastes

00:35:06
<transcript>: It tastes like coffee, but it doesn't have caffeine in it.

00:35:07
<transcript>: line

cowfacedude99: RAID!!!!

00:35:10

<transcript>: From out here. I want to create a new one. T. Max.

00:36:07
<transcript>: Session. No new fashion Pmux config. Okay, we're in tmux. Now look at us. We also fixed our issue. I think.

00:36:07
<transcript>: so now

00:36:10
<transcript>: So now if I go into.

00:36:10
<transcript>: inv

cedpoilly: Raided your stream. did it work? ü§î

00:36:16
laytanl_: never heard of that, sounds weird, tea that tastes like coffee

00:36:18
<transcript>: Now I'm in tmux. I don't like this haze that it's put over my thing. It's like colored. It do less.

<transcript>: do less please

00:36:19
<transcript>: Do less please.

00:36:24
<transcript>: So here. That worked. Now I can just control R.

00:36:24
<transcript>: this is

00:36:27
<transcript>: This is already at newest change.

00:36:27
<transcript>: just because

00:36:30
<transcript>: Just because I just opened this new TMUK session.

00:36:35
<transcript>: Or is it leader key are Reloaded there we are sympax error.

00:36:39

<transcript>: Let's see so syntax era on my tmux. Comp feels that.

00:36:59
cedpoilly: ü•≥

00:37:02
<transcript>: Feels bad.

00:37:08
cowfacedude99: next thing you need to learn is to split panes and windows

00:37:09
<transcript>: Exists. That's all I'm gonna type. I guess I'm gonna detach because I don't know what else to do.

00:37:13
<transcript>: I detached.

00:37:19
<transcript>: So we've got that window.

00:37:19
<transcript>: i need to

00:37:22
<transcript>: I need to go back into my config. I guess.

00:37:22
<transcript>: let's see can i

00:37:23
<transcript>: Let's see can I.

00:37:29
<transcript>: Team ups. How do I open a specific one? I config.

00:37:32
<transcript>: configure

00:37:33
<transcript>: Configure.

00:37:35
<transcript>: Config.

00:37:38
<transcript>: In the arguments need it most zero.

00:37:38
<transcript>: tmax

00:37:40
<transcript>: Tmax a.

00:37:40
<transcript>: so see this is not

00:37:41
<transcript>: So see, this is not.

00:37:49
<transcript>: Next you need to learn is to split pains and Windows. Okay, that sounds good. Let's do that.

00:37:49
<transcript>: let's

00:37:51
<transcript>: Let's learn how to do that.

00:37:51
<transcript>: i also need to learn

00:37:56
<transcript>: I also need to learn how to fix my teammix TMX configuration because I broke it.

00:38:00
<transcript>: I guess I could do that and plain old.

00:38:00
<transcript>: here

00:38:01
cowfacedude99: You can press q and go about your stuff

00:38:01
<transcript>: Here.

00:38:05
<transcript>: Since that I broke it. Did I mess this line up.

00:38:05
<transcript>: did i actually

00:38:08
<transcript>: Did I actually type stuff here on accident.

00:38:10
<transcript>: Looks kind of different.

00:38:17
<transcript>: I'm need to add this plugin manager thing.

00:38:17
<transcript>: we get there

<transcript>: We get there.

00:38:18
cowfacedude99: the ~j

00:38:29
<transcript>: Looks like I added A. J. You know.

00:38:29
<transcript>: sometimes

00:38:31
<transcript>: Sometimes I add jades.

00:38:36
<transcript>: I'm still learning them. Okay, so that looks better.

00:38:36
<transcript>: whoa

00:41:58
danielgerep: What bothers me about tmux is the clipboard.

00:41:59
<transcript>: That's how new I am.

00:42:05
stroopwafel26: prefix d for detach, prefix for new windows, prefix comma for renaming the window

00:42:06
stroopwafel26: tmux <3

00:42:07
<transcript>: The clipboard I o Daniel, now you got me worried that my clipboard is gonna be all screwed up.

00:42:12
<transcript>: Prefix D for attach or for Dtach prefix for new windows.

00:42:15
<transcript>: Prefix. Comma for rename in the window.

00:42:19
<transcript>: Prefix comma.

00:42:19
<transcript>: renames the wind

00:42:20
<transcript>: Renames the window.

00:42:25
<transcript>: Okay. We need to install this thing.

00:42:33
danielgerep: prefix is like the nvim leader key.

00:42:43
<transcript>: Yeah, like the leader key. We've got control a as a as our prefix.

00:42:45
<transcript>: Per.

00:42:45
<transcript>: some recommendation

00:42:47
<transcript>: Some recommendation I don't even remember.

00:42:47
<transcript>: list the plug

00:42:50
<transcript>: List the plugins here. Okay, so clone.

00:42:50
<transcript>: i have to clone

00:42:54
<transcript>: I have to clone it into TMX. Plot. Okay.

00:42:57
<transcript>: Let's do that.

00:43:01
<transcript>: Well, maybe without the dollar sign, though.

00:43:01
danielgerep: I think ctrl+a is the default.

00:43:05
<transcript>: Now we're in a new.

00:43:12
<transcript>: Oh, CTRL A, it was Control B for me, Daniel.

00:43:12
<transcript>: on a mac

00:43:13
<transcript>: On a Mac.

00:43:13
<transcript>: i don't know

00:43:15
<transcript>: I don't know if it matters that I'm on a Mac.

00:43:19
stroopwafel26: also, if you use esc in vim, make sure you shorten the escape time: set -s escape-time 50

00:43:21
danielgerep: Ah! Sorry, you are right.

00:43:23
<transcript>: So I did this. Put this at the bottom of your team X. Comp. How do I go back to the previous window.

00:43:27
cowfacedude99: @danielgerep control b is window.

00:43:31
<transcript>: Also, if you use the escape and vim, make sure you shorten the escape time. Set? S escape time to 50.

00:43:33
<transcript>: Oh boy.

00:43:33
<transcript>: control

00:43:34
<transcript>: Control. B is window.

00:43:34
<transcript>: like

00:43:36
<transcript>: Like leader.

00:43:41
<transcript>: Like prefix then B or just control B.

00:43:45
<transcript>: Control. B. So.

00:43:48
<transcript>: Did that do it.

00:43:48
<transcript>: i

00:43:49
danielgerep: leader + arrows I think?

00:43:49
<transcript>: I should have looked.

00:43:53
<transcript>: The control. B. Do it now.

00:43:57
<transcript>: Probe B is window.

00:44:03
<transcript>: Oh, you're. I'm sorry. Coffee? Is you're responding to Daniel.

00:44:03
<transcript>: yeah yeah

00:44:04
<transcript>: Yeah, Yeah.

00:44:05
cowfacedude99: Not relevent @adamelmore it was an answer

00:44:11
<transcript>: So if you're new if you're just joining we're learning teamucks for 1 hour starting.

00:44:11
<transcript>: some

00:44:16
stroopwafel26: you can also start new windows in the same path; bind c new-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"

00:44:21
<transcript>: Some time ago. Maybe 20 minutes ago. So we got, like 40 minutes left. I'm gonna crash course Pmux here. And then we're gonna work on AW, guess which is in T three stack.

00:44:22
stroopwafel26: i got some tmux tips

00:44:22
urobeat: prefix + number for specific window or prefix + p for previous window or prefix + n for next window

00:44:25
<transcript>: Not relevant? Yeah, yeah? Gotcha.

00:44:31
<transcript>: You can also start new windows in the same path. Buying C new window.

00:44:31
<transcript>: see

00:44:32
<transcript>: See.

00:44:39
<transcript>: You got some TMUK tips? Roof Stroop your way ahead of me on the tmux. We're the same person except you know TMX.

00:44:47
<transcript>: Prefix plus number for specific window or prefix plus P for previous window or prefix plus in for next window that makes sense.

00:44:51
stroopwafel26: you're more than welcome to the tmux club

00:44:53
<transcript>: So prefix N goes to the next window. Finally up two of them. Then they basically just cycle. Right.

00:44:59
cowfacedude99: @urobeat p and n is my usual way to move around

00:45:00
<transcript>: You said prefix number for a specific window. So if I want to go to fish prefix number cool. Okay.

00:45:06
<transcript>: Pnn is my usually way to move around okay got it.

00:45:06
<transcript>: i'm

00:45:09

00:47:54

00:52:34
laytanl_: best thing ever

00:52:39
<transcript>: Okay would not be able to live without Zsh auto jump. Okay latent and Stroop, both lobbying for Zsa.

00:52:43
<transcript>: I'm told.

00:52:44
cowfacedude99: I think the tmux bar can be dealt with later.

00:52:45
<transcript>: The question is.

00:52:50
<transcript>: Who customize the Dracula plugin? No configuration. Here. We got.

00:52:58
<transcript>: I'm so surprised that it does all this stuff.

00:53:02
<transcript>: Is this the official Dracula T mocks? Like why.

00:53:02
<transcript>: it seems so

00:53:05
<transcript>: It seems so out of character for Dracula, it's just a theme.

00:53:05
<transcript>: just colors

00:53:06
<transcript>: Just colors.

00:53:06
<transcript>: why is it doing

00:53:08
<transcript>: Why is it doing all this stuff.

00:53:12
stroopwafel26: the smiley should be a larabar obviously

00:53:14
<transcript>: Kind of like how it says the temperature and the current location, that's kind of cool.

00:53:17
<transcript>: Dark Theme for Team X. Let's see.

00:53:21
<transcript>: Activating.

00:53:30
<transcript>: To enable plugins set up the Dracket plugins option in your TMX config.

00:53:39
<transcript>: Oh, we can deal with it later. Okay, that sounds fine. Cafe. Yeah. Let's focus on what's important.

00:53:41
<transcript>: So what's important.

00:53:41
<transcript>: could you tell me again

00:53:43
<transcript>: Could you tell me again.

00:53:46
<transcript>: Said something earlier. I needed to learn next.

00:53:51
<transcript>: Smiley should be anything else. Really.

00:53:53
<transcript>: This is just not exist. Maybe.

00:53:54
madlep: You can have colours set up totally in your terminal emulator setup, and skip tmux theme - tmux themes end up doing a lot of stuff for the status bar though, cause that's just the easiest place to put it

00:54:01
<transcript>: It's. It's a little drawing to me to have these two bars at the bottom. I might move it to the top. I think I saw earlier. Somebody had it at the top.

00:54:01
<transcript>: also just don't

00:54:07
<transcript>: Also just don't like the color. Like everything just seems hazy. Was it like this before I had tmachs let's just see.

00:54:07
<transcript>: if i

00:54:09
<transcript>: If I.

00:54:11
<transcript>: Don't remember how to exit.

00:54:14
cowfacedude99: I can show you how to split panes into horizontal and vertical  and move around

00:54:14
<transcript>: I could detach.

00:54:17
stroopwafel26: prob caused by tmux

00:54:22
laytanl_: In case you forget your last name it is in your status bar

00:54:22
<transcript>: That haze. Oh, there's the haze. Okay, so the haze is actually Neoven my fault.

00:54:26
stroopwafel26: oh

00:54:27
<transcript>: I don't like this. This is so new and bad.

00:54:27
<transcript>: turns out

00:54:30
<transcript>: Turns out that's always been okay. Cool.

00:54:38
<transcript>: I have, like, a fundamental question. I'm gonna go and ask it.

00:54:38
<transcript>: okay

00:54:41
<transcript>: Okay, Cafe is gonna show me how to.

00:54:41
<transcript>: split pain

00:54:46
<transcript>: Split pains into horizontal and vertical, and move around. Yes, please.

00:54:46
<transcript>: you can

00:54:51

00:55:19
<transcript>: thank you

00:55:21
<transcript>: Thank you Musa, for the follow.

00:55:28
danielgerep: You'll wake up in 3....2.....1....

00:55:34
stroopwafel26: you can also start window numbers from 1 and reorder them automatically   set -g base-index 1 set -g renumber-windows on

00:55:35
<transcript>: So T. Max scenes themes end up doing a lot of stuff for the status bar, though, because that's just easiest place, but yeah, maybe mad up. We're gonna we're gonna figure it out. I'm gonna do. I do still feel like this is hazier, isn't it? It's hazier. We're gonna get rid of that. Haziness.

00:55:39
<transcript>: So, cafes. How do I split? How do I do those things.

00:55:43
<transcript>: In case you forget your last name. Yeah. Exactly.

00:55:50
<transcript>: Start windows. I'll wake up in three, two. Did you hypnotize me? Daniel.

00:55:55
<transcript>: You can also start window numbers from one and reorder them automatically.

00:55:55
<transcript>: set

00:55:57
cowfacedude99: I have these inside mine. They change per person

00:56:03

00:56:07
<transcript>: Set G base index one set G re number windows on Stroop I feel like you are. You are giving me too much credit. You think I am further along in my team's journey. Calf a.

00:56:07

<transcript>: i have no

00:56:21
fragaverage: starting at -1 LUL

00:56:28
<transcript>: I have no context for what is coming out of your mouth. Your fingers. I split using dash and something. Should I share my config? Yeah, share your config.

00:56:34
<transcript>: We'll see that. Okay. I have these inside mine. They change per person.

00:56:38
<transcript>: I didn't understand that one cow face.

00:56:38
nexxeln: tmux?!

00:56:39
cowfacedude99: I split using h and v

00:56:41
nexxeln: hello

00:56:41
cowfacedude99: https://github.com/adgai19/ansible-config-ubuntu/blob/a3326f7f5d7eefd382c86ee9994888256e5abf71/roles/tmux/files/tmux#L70

00:56:54
stroopwafel26: https://github.com/mijndert/dotfiles/blob/main/.tmux.conf#L37

00:56:57
<transcript>: So next one we are. We're learning Team X. I gave Calfhased onehour crash course. Is what we're doing here. How long ago did I start that.

00:57:04
<transcript>: I'd say we're halfway through. So let's say we're 30 minutes. In some of these set of timer, we got 30 more minutes.

00:57:16
<transcript>: When that says Hour and 30, we're moving on to T three stack. Next one. That's why I did this whole thing. Because I wanted to tell you, we're gonna be back on the T three stack. We're building. Aw, guess for the rest of stream.

00:57:20
<transcript>: Okay calf a so you've given me.

00:57:20
<transcript>: you

00:57:22
nexxeln: very cool

00:57:28
<transcript>: You split using H and V makes sense. Horizontal, vertical. Got it. Okay. And then these are your easier Windowslit keys. Okay.

00:57:35
<transcript>: Buying key v split window hpane current path okay.

00:57:40
<transcript>: You know what? Maybe I don't need to understand this. Is that the deal? I don't need to understand this stuff.

00:57:40
<transcript>: i just need to

00:57:42
<transcript>: I just need to copy it.

00:57:45
<transcript>: Move better between pains.

00:57:49
<transcript>: Okay.

00:57:55
<transcript>: And this is your Team X Config, right? Yeah.

00:58:02
<transcript>: I'm just I can't help but look at all of it. And I'm like, what is all this stuff.

00:58:09
nexxeln: i just have oh-my-tmux it has very good defaults

00:58:14
<transcript>: Okay.

00:58:14
danielgerep: Baby steps Adam =)

00:58:19
<transcript>: So just just easier windows split keys.

00:58:19
<transcript>: baby

00:58:21
<transcript>: Baby steps. Yeah. Thank you, Daniel.

00:58:25
stroopwafel26: There's an "oh my" for everything isn't there? :P

00:58:26
cowfacedude99: you need 70 and 71 to to split current pane and 74 through 77 to to move around

00:58:33
<transcript>: You have o my tmux. You're telling me there's an oh, my team X and I could just use that cafe. I can just use all my teeth on my team ax. I love the oh, my family of things.

00:58:33
<transcript>: i

00:58:37
laytanl_: what is aw guess?

00:58:37
<transcript>: I like very good defaults too I'd love to not have a very.

00:58:37
<transcript>: custom

00:58:38
<transcript>: Custom.

00:58:38
<transcript>: pmux

00:58:40
<transcript>: Pmux. Config.

00:58:44
<transcript>: I'd love to use tea mucks, but not as to think about it. Too much.

00:58:46
cowfacedude99: I can't help you there. I haven't used it at all

00:58:47
nexxeln: https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux

00:58:48
laytanl_: will probably find out later

00:58:52
<transcript>: Late in AW guests is a Tobs service guessing name we're gonna make with T three stack.

00:58:52
<transcript>: you will find out later

00:58:54
<transcript>: You will find out later. That's right.

00:58:59
<transcript>: Oh, my team X cow face, come and just use that.

00:58:59
<transcript>: oh you haven't

00:59:01
<transcript>: Oh, you haven't used it at all.

00:59:06
<transcript>: But my team makes myself contained pretty and versatile T Max configuration made with love.

00:59:06
<transcript>: seventeen

00:59:09
<transcript>: 170 stars.

00:59:12
<transcript>: Is this all team X at the bottom here? That's a lot.

00:59:12
<transcript>: i probably not

00:59:14
<transcript>: I probably not want a lot of that.

00:59:14
<transcript>: but

00:59:16
<transcript>: But.

00:59:23
nexxeln: you can disbale stuff

00:59:24
<transcript>: I'm open to the idea of a easy mode.

00:59:37
<transcript>: Oh CA is a secondary prefix for keeping default control. B. Prefix Visual themespired by Power line maximize any pain to a new window with prefix plus.

00:59:37
<transcript>: ssh

00:59:39
stroopwafel26: my tmux status bar is just windows listed, no other bs

00:59:43
<transcript>: Ssh mosh aware username is hostname satisfying information mouse mode toggle with prefix M.

00:59:45
nexxeln: its easy to customize, just have to comment stuff

00:59:51
<transcript>: Well, I need cafes to hold my hand is the thing you know. So if I if I use something he doesn't use.

00:59:51
<transcript>: you can disable

00:59:53
<transcript>: You can disable stuff.

00:59:53
<transcript>: easy

01:00:01
<transcript>: Easy customizers have to comment stuff. Is it just one big config file? Is that all you install? It is just like copy the config. Here we go.

01:00:06
nexxeln: yeah exactly

01:00:08
<transcript>: Run the following per terminal.

01:00:12
<transcript>: Yeah, it's just a big convict file, isn't it.

01:00:20
<transcript>: I'm tempted, I'm tempted, but I.

01:00:20
<transcript>: cafe

01:00:24
laytanl_: Isn't this just going to be like the nvim config you tried and didn't get

01:00:25
<transcript>: Cafe has been graciously giving me a crash course and I feel like if I use this.

01:00:25
<transcript>: he won't be able to

01:00:27
<transcript>: He won't be able to do that anymore.

01:00:33
madlep: tweaking to get window movement consistent between tmux and vim is a game changer. Could not computer without it

01:00:36
<transcript>: Maybe later. Yeah. Maybe I did try to use, like, a pre. I should just learn it. Let's just learn it. We got 30 more minutes.

01:00:36
<transcript>: but

01:00:46
nexxeln: ah yeah you should stick with the crash course then

01:00:53
<transcript>: But I might end up coming back to this. I do like, oh, my zsh know my fish. And if this is like that, then sounds nice. But I did end up just feeling like I already knew pretty quickly what I wanted with new event, and I just wanted to roll my own config. So I think let's just start there with.

01:00:53
<transcript>: tmux

01:00:56
<transcript>: Tmux. So I'm gonna add these binding keys.

01:01:02
<transcript>: Style Movement List of Plugins so like right here.

01:01:07
<transcript>: Split window. I don't already have this. Do I know.

01:01:12
<transcript>: File fruit. Oh, here we go. Remap split pane. So somebody they started to yeah, okay.

01:01:15
<transcript>: So.

01:01:17
<transcript>: Okay.

01:01:17
<transcript>: thank you for the follow

01:01:20
<transcript>: Thank you for the followup part time married.

01:01:22
<transcript>: Yesterday.

01:01:24
<transcript>: I think.

01:01:27
<transcript>: Tweaking to get winners.

01:01:34
<transcript>: Movement. Window movement consistent between P Max and VM is a game changer. Could not compute or without it. Okay.

01:01:34
<transcript>: madlip

01:01:37
<transcript>: Madlip. You have further sold me? I was already sold.

01:01:37
<transcript>: but i'm

01:01:39
<transcript>: But I'm further sold.

01:01:39
<transcript>: i'm already

01:01:42
<transcript>: I'm already sold I can't sold anymore.

01:01:42
<transcript>: the super

01:01:44
<transcript>: The super troopers.

01:01:44
<transcript>: i'm already

01:01:47
<transcript>: I'm already pulled over can't pull over anymore.

01:01:53
<transcript>: Okay, we're sticking with the crash course. Next one. But thank you so much. I didn't know this was a thing.

01:01:53
<transcript>: and i will definitely

01:02:02
<transcript>: And I will definitely be digging into it over the weekend. Actually, I'm taking on vacation. I'll probably dig into it on vacation. That's the kind of thing I'd want to Google on my phone and read about Tim X.

01:02:02
<transcript>: okay so we

01:02:04
cowfacedude99: I move around pane with prefix + c-h c-j c-k c-l because I don't have to release ctrl key

01:02:05
<transcript>: Okay. So we added these, I'm gonna reload.

01:02:05
<transcript>: cafe

01:02:07
<transcript>: Cafes. I'm still with you.

01:02:12
stroopwafel26: tmux is pretty cool when using alacritty

01:02:13
<transcript>: I'm reloading we Reloaded so now I can split pains using your method.

01:02:13
<transcript>: cafe

01:02:23
<transcript>: Cafe The Cow Face Method I'm A round pain with prefix C H J C A Yep Don't have to release control key.

01:02:27
<transcript>: So prefix plus CTRL H.

01:02:29
<transcript>: Okay.

01:02:29
<transcript>: so i don't

01:02:32
<transcript>: So I don't have to release control key.

01:02:34
<transcript>: I see.

01:02:34
<transcript>: it allow

01:02:46
<transcript>: It allows you to leave your yeah, it does feel weird to me doing the prefix and then letting off everything and then hitting something that feels weird so that's feels nice. Control H. So if I want to split a window.

01:02:48
<transcript>: Horizontally.

01:02:48
<transcript>: i would do

01:02:49
<transcript>: I would do.

01:02:55
<transcript>: V wait.

01:02:59
<transcript>: Hj.

01:02:59
<transcript>: hjk and

01:03:03
<transcript>: Hjk and L, I don't see those see.

01:03:06
<transcript>: Current path.

01:03:07
cowfacedude99: prefix v

01:03:19
<transcript>: Oh, there they are. H. L. J. Okay, that's selecting pain. How do I split though I split with I just can't even read these lines and so bad everything.

01:03:19
<transcript>: split wind

01:03:21
<transcript>: Split window.

01:03:21
<transcript>: bind key so

01:03:23
<transcript>: Bind key so just liter v.

01:03:29
<transcript>: I like tmux. That's cool.

01:03:29
<transcript>: okay

01:03:32
fullstacklive: Remember that the prefix is silent. :D

01:03:36
<transcript>: Okay. So if I want to select a pain, you're saying I can just do leader, and then there's, like, just do that. Oh, no, that was not it.

01:03:36
<transcript>: that was

01:03:38
<transcript>: That was not it. What did I do.

01:03:41
<transcript>: I just switched.

01:03:41
<transcript>: windows

01:03:42
<transcript>: Windows.

01:03:42
<transcript>: jeez

01:03:51
<transcript>: Jeez. So the thing that bothers me about two months so far is that we have, like, four containers. There's sessions. They're full of windows, which are full of pains, which are full of it's a lot.

01:03:51
<transcript>: it's a lot

01:03:54
<transcript>: It's a lot all at once.

01:03:54
<transcript>: i still trust

01:03:59
<transcript>: I still trust you. Calf. A prefix. Prefix V. So what? I ended up here.

01:03:59
<transcript>: yes

01:04:12
stroopwafel26: I never use multiple sessions, I use one session called "0" and restore that using aforementioned alias

01:04:13
<transcript>: Yes, Drupe. That's what I'm thinking. I'm thinking Alacrity or alecry, whatever it is, I'm thinking having Alacrity as like this very simple, single pane. And it doesn't have tabs. And that's a feature kind of leans you into the Team X world, and I like it.

01:04:17
<transcript>: Prefix is silent.

01:04:17
<transcript>: what

01:04:20
<transcript>: What? The prefix is silent.

01:04:20
<transcript>: what

01:04:25
<transcript>: What do you mean? Like don't say it. It's always assumed.

01:04:30
fullstacklive: I meant it's implied in the configuration file.

01:04:35
<transcript>: I use one session called Zero and restore that using Affirmation alien. That makes sense. I think I don't need multiple sessions. I need one session. Multiple windows.

01:04:35
<transcript>: and

01:04:43
<transcript>: And pain. But how do I get back to my previous window? These are called windows, right? I have one and two, and I already forgot how to get to them.

01:04:46
<transcript>: Not that way.

01:04:46
<transcript>: leader

01:04:47
stroopwafel26: prefix 1

01:04:53
<transcript>: Leader to Nope. I'm already on that one liter one. There we are. Okay, but you said it was in.

01:04:56
<transcript>: Next and previous.

01:04:57
<transcript>: Is what you do.

01:04:57
<transcript>: yeah okay

01:05:00
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. Cool.

01:05:00
<transcript>: cool

01:05:05
<transcript>: Cool. So we're back here now. I want to do Leader V. You said.

01:05:13
<transcript>: That was to that was to. Yeah, yeah, that's a split V. But how do I select a pain? I expected.

01:05:15
<transcript>: Expected.

01:05:15
<transcript>: a leader

01:05:16
<transcript>: A leader.

01:05:22
<transcript>: If I do liter and then control, I have to hold down control.

01:05:26
<transcript>: Now that's taken me.

01:05:26
stroopwafel26: @FullStackLive I thought you meant prefix is like fight club

01:05:28
cowfacedude99: c-a c-h

01:05:29
stroopwafel26: MaxLOL

01:05:34
<transcript>: I'm not actually getting the pain. I'm trying to move between pains.

01:05:38
<transcript>: Control. A control. H.

01:05:38
<transcript>: i thought you mean

01:05:40
<transcript>: I thought you meant Prefixes the Fight club.

01:05:40
<transcript>: i was

01:05:42
cowfacedude99: or c-a c-j

01:05:43
<transcript>: I was Lightfight Club. It's silent.

01:05:57
<transcript>: Oh, you meant it's implied in the configuration file. Thank you. Full Stack Live. Yeah, yeah, I figured that out eventually, that there always is a leader. Assumed. So when I see a key map. Okay, so CA CJ or CACH.

01:05:59
<transcript>: So if I wanted to go.

01:06:02
<transcript>: To.

01:06:09
<transcript>: I'm in this pane. I want to go to this pain. So I would use L right. I would do like CA.

01:06:11
<transcript>: That's not.

01:06:22
<transcript>: Let off and then reapply the control I thought you saw you said you could just leave it down.

01:06:26
cowfacedude99: You released the ctrl key

01:06:27
<transcript>: Did I did I reload this config.

01:06:31
<transcript>: Reloaded. I got a strategy.

01:06:31
<transcript>: control

01:06:33
<transcript>: Control. A. Control. L.

01:06:36
<transcript>: ly

01:06:36
<transcript>: lytt cycling

01:06:41
<transcript>: Lytt cycling through my oh, do they have a debit remap down here somewhere? I bet they do.

01:06:41
<transcript>: then style

01:06:43
<transcript>: Then style through pains.

01:06:48
<transcript>: Split. So here we have selected twice.

01:06:53
corfliss: Hey, sorry for kinda ruining the vibe a bit. So I got a relay from someone that some streams ago you said something... not comforting to him. Idk what it is, so I am just relaying.

01:06:53
<transcript>: And then I bet there's a remap it down here too.

01:06:53
<transcript>: through windows

01:06:56
<transcript>: Through windows. Here. Hahaha.

01:06:56
<transcript>: control agent

01:07:02
<transcript>: Control. Agent. Control. L. There it is. We remapped it. That's the problem.

01:07:11
<transcript>: Core Flis. Hey, sorry for kind of room. The vibe a bit, so I got a relay from someone that some streams ago. You said something not comforting to him. Oh, what.

01:07:15
<transcript>: Corpus. What? As I said something that comforting to someone.

01:07:23
<transcript>: That is hurting my vibe. I mean in a in a constructive way. Thank you for the feedback. I would love to know what I said.

01:07:33
<transcript>: Who was it? Can you DM me or something? Got a relay from someone that some streams ago. You said something not comforting to him. I don't know what it is, so I'm just relaying.

01:07:33
<transcript>: poor

01:07:35
<transcript>: Poor fly.

01:07:39
<transcript>: I said something not comforting.

01:07:44
corfliss: I can DM him.

01:07:47
mryasser2194: sounds like  troll tbh

01:07:52
corfliss: Don't worry, you'll be fine.

01:07:52
andom: ^

01:07:52
<transcript>: Well, if you want to DM me, I'd love to learn more.

01:07:52
<transcript>: just like let me know

01:08:00
<transcript>: Just like, let me know. I don't mean to say things that aren't comforting to people. Now. I opened up your profile thing, and I can't close it.

01:08:00
<transcript>: okay

01:08:02
<transcript>: Okay. Feels good.

01:08:03
cowfacedude99: You might need to remove the vim style stuff.

01:08:05
<transcript>: Refresh.

01:08:05
<transcript>: refresh

01:08:08
<transcript>: Refresh in my chat because I can't see anything now.

01:08:11
<transcript>: Okay.

01:08:16
<transcript>: I need to remove the Vim style stuff. Yeah, yeah, I think so.

01:08:18
<transcript>: I really.

01:08:26
laytanl_: "from someone", "some streams ago", "said something"

01:08:26
<transcript>: I think it's just this right. We've just got them south through windows.

01:08:26
cowfacedude99: that's clashing

01:08:30
<transcript>: These need to be let's just comment them.

01:08:30
<transcript>: right

01:08:32
<transcript>: Right.

01:08:32
laytanl_: not much to go off

01:08:33
fullstacklive: Doesn't matter if you release the Ctrl key.

01:08:34
<transcript>: Let's comment. Those.

01:08:40
<transcript>: Reload Reloaded. Okay. Now I should be able to do.

01:08:40
<transcript>: then southrop

01:08:43
<transcript>: Then southropanes. I can delete this.

01:08:45
<transcript>: Let's do this a cool way.

01:08:45
<transcript>: delet

01:08:48
<transcript>: Delete. Four day Oh.

01:08:48
<transcript>: what is that

01:08:49
<transcript>: What is that.

01:08:49
<transcript>: five

01:08:57
<transcript>: Five day. Oh, I didn't like that. Actually, that thing popping up in my face. Vince. File through windows.

01:09:06
<transcript>: That's the thing I just commented. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

01:09:16
<transcript>: Reload. Okay. So now should be able to do what? Yeah. I'm in my pain now. Feels good. That feels good. Cuff. I like that approved.

01:09:16
<transcript>: approve

01:09:17
<transcript>: Approve.

01:09:24
<transcript>: Doesn't matter if you release let's see from someone some should have said something yeah like.

01:09:30
<transcript>: I want to give the benefit of that here. I don't know your Corp list that well, but if I said something offensive.

01:09:30
<transcript>: i take that

01:09:34
<transcript>: I take that seriously. I don't want to send let me know.

01:09:39
<transcript>: Doesn't matter if you release the control key.

01:09:43
<transcript>: I think the way we have it.

01:09:43
<transcript>: the way we have

01:09:50
<transcript>: The way we have it configured. Now, I think we're good on that. I think I know what I had done wrong. I was just remapping it down here.

01:09:53
<transcript>: Now I don't have a good way to select window. Maybe.

01:09:57
<transcript>: Or wait already. Yeah. No. Cafe says he just says the bill.

01:09:59
<transcript>: Just use a builtin which is that.

01:09:59
<transcript>: yeah

01:10:01
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:10:03
cowfacedude99: And that's enough to start you off.

01:10:03
<transcript>: I can get used to that.

01:10:08
<transcript>: Okay.

01:10:12
<transcript>: So here we are we can navigate between pains now.

01:10:15
<transcript>: Feels good.

01:10:15
<transcript>: a fascinating

01:10:16
<transcript>: A fascinating.

01:10:19
<transcript>: How fast the capacity.

01:10:31
<transcript>: Enough to start you off. Oh, you did it.

01:10:35
<transcript>: You did it countless. You gave me the primer. We're good.

01:10:39
<transcript>: That's enough to start you off now. I just want to make it look better, you know.

01:10:44
<transcript>: I've got this now I've got pains but I want to fix the theme.

01:10:44
<transcript>: and we fix

01:10:45
fullstacklive: I set my tmux and vim to use Ctrl-HJKL without any prefix to switch panes.

01:10:48
<transcript>: And we fix the theme. Now can I go into the Drakkill. Config and make it not so bad.

01:10:53
<transcript>: Switch the left smiley icon. That'd be great.

01:10:58
<transcript>: So I'm just doing these inside.

01:11:06
parttimemarried: !project

01:11:06
fossabot: Building a Twitch overlay in Next.JS

01:11:10
<transcript>: I set my tmux and Vim to use CTRL Hjkl Oh, Yeah.

01:11:10
<transcript>: so

01:11:11
madlep: dracula has a bunch of config options for status bar etc, which is cool

01:11:15
<transcript>: So I gotta fix that. How do I? How do I fix that project command.

01:11:20
<transcript>: Directly's a bunch of config options your status for etc which is cool.

01:11:22
<transcript>: Yeah, so.

01:11:22
<transcript>: it just occurred

01:11:25
<transcript>: It just occurred to me you can VSplit in vim.

01:11:31
<transcript>: If you use tmux. Do you stop V splitting in vim? Is that what you do.

01:11:34
<transcript>: People normal people.

01:11:34
<transcript>: what do you

01:11:36
cowfacedude99: @FullStackLive i found that it interfered with some stuff

01:11:37
<transcript>: What do you do? Do you do both.

01:11:39
<transcript>: If so, why.

01:11:42
madlep: why not both?

01:11:49
<transcript>: Oh, I guess you still have split cuz like it's like a project you have open in vim. You might still want to split that horizontally or vertically.

01:11:49
<transcript>: i guess

01:11:51
fullstacklive: No, I split windows in tmux for shells and split buffers in vim for files.

01:11:56
<transcript>: I guess. But then navigating between those and then navigating between the pains and tmux. It's just like.

01:11:56
<transcript>: it's a lot

01:11:57
<transcript>: It's a lot.

01:11:59
madlep: I have vim in one pane with files and things, then another tmux split running tests/doing git etc

01:12:01
parttimemarried: Already abandoned Awguess???

01:12:04
fullstacklive: That's why I set the same keybinds.

01:12:19
<transcript>: No. I split Windows and tea mucks for shells and split buffers in Vim for files. Yeah, yeah. It occurred to me that there's utility to use both. I get it now. I have them in one pane with files and things, then another team like split running tests and get yeah, Yeah.

01:12:19
<transcript>: no parttime

01:12:29
<transcript>: No parttime married. I did not abandon you. Guess we're just learning tmux. I gave Catholics 1 hour to give me a crash course. We are fast approaching that hour and.

01:12:29
<transcript>: we

01:12:33
<transcript>: We might already be done. I just kind of want to fix there's just some glaring.

01:12:33
<transcript>: bad things

01:12:35
<transcript>: Bad things aesthetic that I can't handle.

01:12:35
<transcript>: vince

01:12:43
<transcript>: Vince thy through resizing. So if I'm Resize, I'm going to what's the R stand for.

01:12:44
<transcript>: Find.

01:12:47
<transcript>: Eight.

01:12:47
<transcript>: resize

01:12:54
<transcript>: Resize pane left. So if I do, what is the R? I don't know what the R is. Leader. Capital H.

01:12:57
<transcript>: Oh, yeah? Okay.

01:12:57
<transcript>: i was like

01:13:03
<transcript>: I was like, Does the army. I can just keep doing it without hitting the leader key again. I bet that's what it means.

01:13:03
<transcript>: that's

01:13:05
<transcript>: That's cool. Okay.

01:13:07
<transcript>: If I'm gonna VSplit.

01:13:11
<transcript>: Let's do a V slit real quick, so it's just leader v.

01:13:14
<transcript>: And not control.

01:13:21
<transcript>: Oh, that's already what I did. How do you kill a pain? How do I kill a pain? I want to delete this pain.

01:13:27
<transcript>: It's not gonna be what I'm about to click, but I'm gonna do it anyway. Oh, it was not that.

01:13:28
cowfacedude99: leader x

01:13:30
fullstacklive: End the shell, Ctrl-D or exit.

01:13:30
<transcript>: Oh, man.

01:13:31
zaphoidx: Should be Leader + X

01:13:33
<transcript>: It's funny.

01:13:36
<transcript>: Leader X thank you so much.

01:13:36
<transcript>: zapped

01:13:40
<transcript>: Zapped. Welcome to Chat. End the shell control, B or exit.

01:13:46
<transcript>: Leader X calfh says, okay, so I've got a let's just drag this over here.

01:13:48
cowfacedude99: I forgot about that one.

01:13:52
<transcript>: Switch places if you will. No, not like that.

01:13:52
<transcript>: not

01:13:54
<transcript>: Not like this. Come on, you buy.

01:13:58
<transcript>: Let's do it you buy have a good day.

01:13:58
<transcript>: we

01:14:00
<transcript>: We were doing so good.

01:14:02
kultiviert: I love the Ozark series Kreygasm

01:14:02
<transcript>: Well here I think I know how to.

01:14:09
<transcript>: And then there's windows in my Mac, and there's spaces in my Mac, there's just so many containers.

01:14:09
<transcript>: if i

01:14:13
<transcript>: If I ever get to where I can navigate between all these things efficiently.

01:14:13
<transcript>: i'll be

01:14:14
<transcript>: I'll be impressed.

01:14:18
fullstacklive: It's containers all the way down.

01:14:19
<transcript>: That seems like a lot I have some navigate workspaces.

01:14:23
madlep: can just exit the shell process too, and it'll close the pane

01:14:24
<transcript>: Or spaces or whatever the call then my Mac, and then I've got windows.

01:14:29
<transcript>: And then inside of a window, like inside of my emulator. I could have.

01:14:29
<transcript>: tmuk se

01:14:35
cowfacedude99: that's why I am one thing per window LUL

01:14:39
<transcript>: Tmuk sessions that have windows that have pains that have inverted with pains. V. Splits.

01:14:43
<transcript>: It's enough to make your brain explode.

01:14:45
<transcript>: Like it really is.

01:14:48
<transcript>: Containers. All the way down. That's right.

01:14:55
<transcript>: Cultivate you love the Ozark series. I'm glad to hear that. Welcome to Chat. I live in the Ozarks, just like that show.

01:15:09
<transcript>: Now I gotta get back to okay. I want to move this your one thing per window. I love that cafe. I think that's the way to do it. I think it's. I think that's the way to do it cultivirt. Thank you so much for the follow. I appreciate that.

01:15:14
zaphoidx: There's a bit of a divide where I work on whether to use multiple vim instances in tmux, or vim panes

01:15:18
madlep: `tmux attach-session` to reconnect

01:15:23
<transcript>: That's why I'm one thing for window. Yeah. So you don't have a browser and you just have a single thing and then you just, like, slide over to your browser or something. You never cowfac. You never feel like you need to have a browser up and a thing up to see at the same time. You never feel like that.

01:15:27
cowfacedude99: I took it from prime,

01:15:32
<transcript>: Attach. Yeah. Mad's up. We're gonna get there. I just want to position this. You buy style, and I think it's no, I think it's this.

01:15:35
<transcript>: Nope. So if I want to go up to that one.

01:15:38
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:15:38
<transcript>: i'm gonna go down to

01:15:40
<transcript>: I'm gonna go down to this one.

01:15:40
<transcript>: yep

01:15:44
<transcript>: Yep. Okay. So that's how I navigate with SKD.

01:15:44
<transcript>: now

01:15:46
<transcript>: Now I want to move the pain over there.

01:15:49
<transcript>: Go, it's not working.

01:15:49
<transcript>: you

01:15:51
<transcript>: You buy hates me.

01:15:53
<transcript>: I can't ever.

01:16:00
<transcript>: I want you by to do this horizontally or whatever vertically. Not like this.

01:16:00
<transcript>: not

01:16:04
<transcript>: Not like this you buy not like this.

01:16:10
<transcript>: I wanted to open another thing just so that I can let's see.

01:16:15
<transcript>: Oh, Geez.

01:16:21
<transcript>: Now fix it, fix it for me.

01:16:27
<transcript>: I just have to get rid of the browser. Is that what I'm have to do.

01:16:31
fullstacklive: Bad Yabai, no cookie!

01:16:33
<transcript>: Come on. You by. I want it right there. I want it. No, it's worse.

01:16:39
<transcript>: Oh, you buy sometimes you buy just too much for me.

01:16:40
laytanl_: I don't use tmux for exactly that reason, I am running out of modifier keys lol

01:16:42
<transcript>: I.

01:16:46
<transcript>: Got to be like key commands I just haven't learned with you by.

01:16:47
cowfacedude99: I have my terminal on 0, browser on 1 and other things on rest.

01:16:50
<transcript>: Bad you buy no cookie.

01:16:59
<transcript>: Or I work on whether to use multiple vitamins. This is in T, Max or Vim pains.

01:16:59
<transcript>: you can see

01:17:02
<transcript>: You can see there could be a lot of debates on over this stuff.

01:17:05
<transcript>: Running on a modifier keys. Yeah, exactly.

01:17:10
cedpoilly: defeated by your window manager

01:17:12
fullstacklive: And that's where we convince Adam to switch to Linux and a proper window manager. LUL

01:17:14
<transcript>: Terminal on Zero browser on one other thing's on rest. I kind of like that. You said you stole it from prime. I really like it if prime does it.

01:17:14
<transcript>: why are you doing

01:17:15
parkour_peter: maybe app with windows window features?

01:17:15
<transcript>: Why are you doing this.

01:17:15
<transcript>: the horizontal

01:17:18
<transcript>: The horizontal, horizontal thing. This is awful.

01:17:18
<transcript>: why would

01:17:18
zgredfred1: get browser out of workspace and insert again, may help

01:17:19
laytanl_: Yabai has a rotate keybind which is great

01:17:20
<transcript>: Why would anyone want it this way? Let's open another.

01:17:23
<transcript>: Alacrity.

01:17:31
<transcript>: 's Now I shouldn't do that. I don't want to. Alacrates. But I'm trying to.

01:17:36
<transcript>: Fix my window layout. I guess I'm just gonna do this.

01:17:36
<transcript>: yeah yeah

01:17:37
<transcript>: Yeah, Yeah.

01:17:40
<transcript>: And then I can. I can kill this one.

01:17:40
<transcript>: now go

01:17:42
<transcript>: Now, go.

01:17:42
<transcript>: one

01:17:47
karrbs: The only time I want horizontal stacking is on a vertical monitor

01:17:49
<transcript>: One. Alacrity. Open. Let's just forget about the browser for men. We don't need a browser, except when I want to configure Dracula. And then I want to see some stuff.

01:17:49
<transcript>: so

01:17:52
<transcript>: So tmux.

01:17:52
laytanl_: hyper - r : yabai -m space --rotate 270

01:17:53
<transcript>: We're back.

01:17:53
<transcript>: we're back

01:17:59
<transcript>: We're back. And what do I want to do here? I want to so navigating pains just learning.

01:17:59
<transcript>: oh that's

01:18:02
<transcript>: Oh, that's did not go the direction I expected.

01:18:05
<transcript>: What.

01:18:07
<transcript>: Our face. It's Macwood.

01:18:11
<transcript>: Are the backward.

01:18:14
<transcript>: Seems so backward to me.

01:18:20
<transcript>: Select pain H is to the right now. Http to the left.

01:18:23
<transcript>: Cafes. Do you see this.

01:18:29
<transcript>: Fixing it. Why do you do that? I need to know why you do that now.

01:18:33
<transcript>: And so backwards to me.

01:18:36
<transcript>: Okay, well, I'm making this config my own.

01:18:40
cowfacedude99: I use 2 panes onvsplit and hsplit

01:18:40
<transcript>: Didn't notice it when I only had two panes. Now I notice it.

01:18:46
cowfacedude99: so it doesn't matter for me

01:18:50
<transcript>: These two pains. Oh, okay. So you only ever use two. So you never notice that you have a bug.

01:18:52
<transcript>: I'm calling it a bug.

01:18:53
fullstacklive: I was confused myself when I saw H key with -R and L ke with -L.

01:18:59
<transcript>: That's where we convince Adam to switch to Linux, and a proper window manager.

01:18:59
<transcript>: if

01:19:04
<transcript>: If a Linux could fully take care of my Mac studio or not take care if it could fully.

01:19:09
<transcript>: Take advantage of my Mac studio and all of the M one.

01:19:09
<transcript>: max web

01:19:13
<transcript>: Max web whatever your ultra thing if it could take advantage of all that hardware.

01:19:13
<transcript>: then i could be

01:19:22
parkour_peter: windows with wsl2

01:19:29
<transcript>: Then I could be on board. I don't really think there's anything about Mac OS that I care for. There's nothing macOS specific. One thing I care for is that if I need to install something because I want to use it, that it's easy to find a way to install it. Now I have to like, build from source, like install CMake or whatever.

01:19:31
<transcript>: Gcc.

01:19:31
<transcript>: none of that

01:19:33
cowfacedude99: Your audio stuff might be an issue

01:19:40
<transcript>: None of that nonsense. I just want to install things. So I do like brew. I guess in that sense that's my speed on computers. I'm not like tinkerer.

01:19:43
zaphoidx: Yeah but apt etc. is so much better than brew

01:19:44
cowfacedude99: you get used to building stuff directly

01:19:46
<transcript>: Defeated by your window manager exactly.

01:19:52
<transcript>: App with Windows. Window features.

01:19:52
<transcript>: carbs

01:19:56
<transcript>: Carbs. Thanks so much for the follow. Also, cultivate. Did I see that cultivity.

01:19:56
<transcript>: thank

01:19:57
cedpoilly: @adamelmore it's time to customise your own Linux distro üëÄ

01:20:02
zgredfred1: linux vm?

01:20:04
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow. Five minutes ago. Get browser out of workspace and insert again. Yeah, yeah, good calls. That grid. Welcome to Chat. I appreciate you.

01:20:04
<transcript>: i think we're hitting

01:20:08
<transcript>: I think we're hitting our hour Mark. It's about time to AW, guess.

01:20:08
<transcript>: start time

01:20:10
nutlesssquirrel: Ricing time? Lets gooo

01:20:11
<transcript>: Start time as time start building AW guess.

01:20:15
<transcript>: You buy has a rotate key bind which is great.

01:20:15
<transcript>: oh maybe

01:20:24
<transcript>: Oh, maybe that's what I need. I need to look at my I'm gonna do some stuff over my vacation. I'm gonna get way better at computers, and then I'm gonna come back and you're gonna be like, Wow.

01:20:24
<transcript>: i'm so

01:20:27
<transcript>: I'm so good at computers.

01:20:27
<transcript>: carbs

01:20:36
<transcript>: Carbs. Welcome to Chat. The only time I want horizontal stacking is on a vertical monitor. Exactly. I never want to that split. Whatever that is for is a horizontal split.

01:20:38
<transcript>: Hyper.

01:20:38
<transcript>: are

01:20:47
<transcript>: Are you buy M space rotate 270. Oh Geez latent. What do I do with that? That's the thing I could type in my terminal and hit enter and it would do stuff.

01:21:07
<transcript>: I used two panes so it doesn't matter. Me. Yeah, yeah. Makes sense. I was confused myself when I saw H key with our Ya. Me too. Windows with WSL two your audio stuff might be an issue. That's true. The Linux audio stuff, but Apt etc. Is so much better than Brew. That makes sense. I guess I've done that in my days of system administration.

01:21:14
laytanl_: That's the skhd line, you got skhd with yabai right?

01:21:15
<transcript>: You get used to building stuff directly. Interesting. I don't know about that. It's time to customize your own Linux distro. Oh Gees, stop it.

01:21:15
<transcript>: okay

01:21:17
<transcript>: Okay.

01:21:21
<transcript>: It's a Ricing time. What's ricing.

01:21:28
laytanl_: just paste it into the skhd config

01:21:32
<transcript>: Oh, that's the SK. Yeah, I've got SKD. So you're just giving me the line. I think I already even have it in there. I just need to learn the keyboard. There's just so many new key maps to learn. You know, your brain can only hold so much.

01:21:32
<transcript>: so

01:21:39
<transcript>: So I know how to do pains. And then somebody told me how I can kill a pain. So, leader X.

01:21:41
<transcript>: No pain, Yes.

01:21:44
<transcript>: So it just come, it confirmed.

01:21:52
<transcript>: Okay, I feel good. I can create pains now. I don't know about sessions or windows. How do I kill windows? Like I don't want that second window.

01:21:52
<transcript>: get out of here

01:21:55
<transcript>: Get out of here second window. How do I go back to it.

01:22:04
<transcript>: Selecting windows was next like that. So here's this window. How do I kill this window? So let me just give me that. And then I can move on to life.

01:22:08
nutlesssquirrel: I was going off what @cedpoilly suggested. Linux ricing. It's an interesting way of life.

01:22:12
<transcript>: Yeah late. I think already have the SKD binding for that. I just didn't learn the binding.

01:22:14
cowfacedude99: same way

01:22:18
<transcript>: Same way.

01:22:18
<transcript>: x

01:22:20
<transcript>: X.

01:22:20
<transcript>: bill pain

01:22:21
fullstacklive: The window will close when you end your shell session, just just press Ctrl-d.

01:22:22
<transcript>: Bill Pain. Yes.

01:22:23
<transcript>: Okay.

01:22:23
<transcript>: a window

01:22:24
madlep: exit

01:22:28
<transcript>: A window my multiple pains. I don't even want to show windows so I'm only gonna use one window.

01:22:28
<transcript>: is that true

01:22:29
<transcript>: Is that true.

01:22:31
cowfacedude99: killing all panes inside will kill the windew

01:22:39
<transcript>: One session, one window. Can I just ignore some windows and tmux and just have one of each and then all the pains I want.

01:22:39
<transcript>: it's okay

01:22:41
<transcript>: It's okay.

01:22:41
<transcript>: so a reason

01:22:43
<transcript>: So a reason that that's a bad idea.

01:22:48
cowfacedude99: You are going to use more than one window

01:22:49
<transcript>: That makes sense cafes okay killing all session all pains kills the window.

01:22:54
<transcript>: Going to use more than one window. Okay, fine.

01:22:54
<transcript>: i guess

01:23:00
<transcript>: I guess I just don't like having like a list of things I have. Open this. Let's why I don't like tabs. You know.

01:23:05
<transcript>: I'd really like to make this look better, because the Dracula thing, it's just bad.

01:23:05
<transcript>: if i can

01:23:07
<transcript>: If I can get.

01:23:07
<transcript>: it and not hate me

01:23:16
<transcript>: It and not hate me. Oh, my God, I hate you. I hate you. You buy. This is. This is what happened the other day. And then I left you by. I was out.

01:23:16
fullstacklive: You can name windows, makes it easier to see what's where.

01:23:21
corfliss: Sorry what did I miss?

01:23:23
<transcript>: And then I came crawling back. Something about it. I just like opinions, you know? I like something to tell me, what to do.

01:23:23
<transcript>: and

01:23:24
<transcript>: And.

01:23:28
<transcript>: I like that about you by but I don't like this.

01:23:36
<transcript>: I don't like it. Okay, so I need to rotate. That's what you're telling me. Let's learn it. Let's learn the rotate. Let's.

01:23:38
<transcript>: Invent.

01:23:40
<transcript>: Config.

01:23:40
<transcript>: sk

01:23:42
<transcript>: Skd.

01:23:50
<transcript>: Okay. So focus. Warp navigating.

01:23:50
<transcript>: move folks

01:23:51
<transcript>: Move, folks.

01:23:54
<transcript>: Resize windows.

01:23:59
fullstacklive: Naming windows is <prefix>Comma, at least for me.

01:24:00
<transcript>: Rotate. Here we go.

01:24:00
<transcript>: alt

01:24:01
cowfacedude99: more panes occupy your screen -> so it is better to use more than one window.

01:24:05
<transcript>: Altr. There's no leader key involved here. I just hit alt R, and it's gonna do that.

01:24:07
madlep: usual workflow I have is session per "area" (ie one for work, one for config, one for open source or whatever); window per project (ie each source repo from work), then multiple panes per window changed often

01:24:12
<transcript>: Apparently. There we go. Hey, it worked. Leighton. You saved me.

01:24:23
<transcript>: What did you miss? Corpolis? You didn't miss much. I'm still just. I'm getting my feet wet here with Tmachs and we're getting ready to start working on AW, guess.

01:24:28
<transcript>: Name Windows makes it easier to see what's? Where? That makes sense. Okay.

01:24:28
<transcript>: nam

01:24:31
<transcript>: Naming Windows is prefix. Comma.

01:24:31
<transcript>: at least for you

01:24:34
<transcript>: At least for you. Okay, let's try it.

01:24:35
<transcript>: Prefix.

01:24:35
<transcript>: comm

01:24:38
<transcript>: Comma. Rename window.

01:24:38
<transcript>: we're gonna call

01:24:39
<transcript>: We're gonna call this one.

01:24:44
<transcript>: What's my it's my Team X, config.

01:24:46
cowfacedude99: and you an zoom in and out of window with prefix z

01:24:48
<transcript>: Okay, team X can be cool. That feels good.

01:24:50
<transcript>: We can go over here.

01:24:50
<transcript>: we can make

01:24:54
<transcript>: We can make it bigger. What did I say? Resize was.

01:24:54
<transcript>: a leader

01:24:57
<transcript>: A leader in them Capital H.

01:25:00
<transcript>: Yeah. So we can do that. Okay. Cool.

01:25:03
<transcript>: And then.

01:25:03
<transcript>: in

<transcript>: alt

01:25:14
<transcript>: Alt.

01:25:14
cowfacedude99: pane*

01:25:16
<transcript>: Like that.

01:25:24
<transcript>: So. Okay, there's white cow face is a one thing for window person. And I get it, I get it, I get it.

01:25:31
<transcript>: Let's fix our Dracula, and then we're gonna move on to AW. Guess stats, bar options enable. So what do I need to do here.

01:25:31
<transcript>: conf

01:25:35
laytanl_: You should look at this for yabai too https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4488655/61372700-23c32e00-a898-11e9-8052-aeb5db9f4e13.png

01:25:39
<transcript>: Configuration to enable plugins set up the Dracula Plugins option in your Team X Config file. Separate plugin by space.

01:25:39
<transcript>: the order

01:25:44
<transcript>: The order that you define the plugins will be the order on the status bar left to right. Okay.

01:25:44
<transcript>: make

01:25:49
<transcript>: Make sure that is the bottom. Yeah. Run TMX use the TPM install. Okay.

01:25:52
<transcript>: For each plugin is possible.

01:25:52
<transcript>: to customize

01:26:01
<transcript>: To customize background and foreground colors. Why would I want to do that? It's Dracula. You are the one that sets the colors. I don't want to change them. I just want you to have opinions.

01:26:03
<transcript>: Come on. People.

01:26:03
<transcript>: boss me around

01:26:05
<transcript>: Boss me around.

01:26:10
laytanl_: It shows regions you can drag a window and what it does, so if you drag a window on the far right of another they will warp like you wanted

01:26:11
<transcript>: More pains occupy your screen so it is better to use more than one window. Okay, that makes sense.

01:26:29
<transcript>: Usual workflow I have is session per area, I. E. One for work, one for config, one for open source or whatever. Okay, window per project. Each source repo from work. Okay, then multiple panes per window changed often. Thank you for the follow. Jack. I appreciate that. Follow.

01:26:32
<transcript>: I'm sure all the.

01:26:32
<transcript>: feel for it

01:26:34
<transcript>: Feel for it what I like here with tmucks.

01:26:40
<transcript>: You Zoom in and out of window with prefix Z. Zoom in and out.

01:26:41
<transcript>: Prefix.

01:26:49
<transcript>: Of a pain. How do I Zoom in? So you're saying prefix Z? Oh, I can just like, focus. It.

01:26:52
<transcript>: Like focus mode like.

01:26:55
<transcript>: I'm zooming? Oh, Geez, what did I do.

01:27:01
<transcript>: Okay. That's cool. So if I want to make it the only thing that's how.

01:27:09
<transcript>: Okay. You should look at this for you. Buy too late in I'm gonna pause on that latent can you remind me some other time.

01:27:11
cowfacedude99: I call it zooming LUL

01:27:14
<transcript>: Shows regions you can drag it window to oh, that sounds actually really helpful.

01:27:20
<transcript>: Okay. I will look at it now. Oh, okay. So that's warping.

01:27:20
<transcript>: swapping

01:27:21
<transcript>: Swapping.

01:27:23
<transcript>: Okay. Okay.

01:27:23
<transcript>: feels good

01:27:25
<transcript>: Feels good.

01:27:28
<transcript>: Let's.

01:27:36
<transcript>: Fix the Dracula thing. Like I said, gonna fix it.

01:27:41
<transcript>: Gonna fix Dracula status? Bar options.

01:27:46
<transcript>: Show Power line.

01:27:48
<transcript>: So what happens if I turn this up.

01:28:03
<transcript>: So that's showing the power line with I say false.

01:28:07
<transcript>: Okay. So now I have nothing at the bottom. There.

01:28:09
<transcript>: No, I do.

01:28:09
<transcript>: power line

01:28:14
<transcript>: Power line. I'm not power line is our line. Symbols.

01:28:21
<transcript>: Available plugins.

01:28:27
<transcript>: Set G CPU usage GPU usage Ram usage. So this is how I can set.

01:28:27
<transcript>: i don't know

01:28:29
<transcript>: I don't know what power line was.

01:28:29
<transcript>: you call it zero

01:28:32
<transcript>: You call it Zeroing. Okay, cool.

01:28:36
<transcript>: I don't know if that's what it's called. You're saying that's just what you call it.

01:28:39
<transcript>: Dracula plugins.

01:28:45
<transcript>: It says this actually going to do something.

01:28:47
<transcript>: Let's Zoom in.

01:28:53

01:28:57
<transcript>: Now that should be different.

01:28:57
<transcript>: it is not

01:28:58
<transcript>: It is not.

01:28:58
<transcript>: unless

01:29:06
<transcript>: Unless the left side is always the same. And then that's. Yeah. Cpu GPU. Okay. It is right. Yeah. Yeah. That works. Gpu unknown.

01:29:06
<transcript>: so here's

01:29:10
<transcript>: So here's the available plugins battery, CPU usage, git.

01:29:18
<transcript>: Gpu usage Ram usage Network Do I need Git? I feel like I already have Git on my vim.

01:29:23
<transcript>: Maybe I don't let's see what get looks like.

01:29:29
<transcript>: This for sure.

01:29:32

<transcript>: Let's rename this one to.

01:48:07
<transcript>: Aw guess.

01:48:11
<transcript>: And then let's create a new window. Look at me. I'm just going window crazy.

01:48:14
<transcript>: This one's gonna be.

01:48:14
<transcript>: we're gonna

01:48:18
<transcript>: We're gonna run the Dev server. I guess I could.

01:48:18
<transcript>: i want to actually

01:48:20
<transcript>: I want to actually run the dead server in a separate way.

01:48:20
<transcript>: yeah

01:48:22
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:48:22
<transcript>: i guess so

01:48:23
<transcript>: I guess so.

01:48:33
<transcript>: Dev server these Windows names are probably too long, so this one's gonna be PMPM run Dev.

01:48:36
<transcript>: Oh, I'm not in the right place.

01:48:37
stroopwafel26: I had to "set background=dark" in my vimrc to make it play nice with tmux for colors

01:48:39
<transcript>: Code.

01:48:41
<transcript>: Playground.

01:48:43
<transcript>: Aw guess.

01:48:45

01:49:14
<transcript>: i can't live

01:49:17
<transcript>: I can't live with this tmux.

01:49:21
<transcript>: No background color or something.

01:49:23
cowfacedude99: I would recommend to run all things for running stuff inside one window with splits

01:49:24
<transcript>: Transferring satisfy.

01:49:31
<transcript>: Background Color on the status left of change.

01:49:31
<transcript>: on it

01:49:32
<transcript>: On it.

01:49:34
<transcript>: Now.

01:49:49
<transcript>: Like this is definitely not normal, right? I mean, I mean, it's not like my other setup.

01:49:51
stroopwafel26: it's a vim thing

01:49:57
<transcript>: Doesn't look like the colors without tmux and that's gonna bother me a lot.

01:49:59
cowfacedude99: at least that's how I do it

01:50:03
<transcript>: Like that. Just that it looks Brown.

01:50:03
<transcript>: it's a vin

01:50:05
<transcript>: It's a Vin thing.

01:50:08
<transcript>: Run all things we're running stuff inside one window with splits.

01:50:11
<transcript>: Okay. I see yourself.

01:50:16
<transcript>: Corpless. Today is not up to date. Sorry.

01:50:16
<transcript>: so you're saying

01:50:17
<transcript>: So you're saying.

01:50:17
<transcript>: like

01:50:17
stroopwafel26: background=dark fixes it hehe

01:50:21
stroopwafel26: no idea for nvim

01:50:22
<transcript>: Like, AW, guess just do a split in here, so create a new pain.

01:50:28
<transcript>: I'm gonna have to go over here to see how to create paint again.

01:50:28
<transcript>: oh yeah it's just

01:50:31
<transcript>: Oh, yeah? It's just V and H. So.

01:50:34
<transcript>: I'm gonna get so fast at this someday.

01:50:34
<transcript>: peace deal

01:50:37
<transcript>: Peace deal, proxy. I'm gonna kill this one.

01:50:42
<transcript>: I'm just gonna kill that window, even which is literally X.

01:50:44
<transcript>: Yes.

01:50:47
<transcript>: So AW guess.

01:50:47
<transcript>: this one

01:50:49
<transcript>: This one is gonna have a new split.

01:50:53
<transcript>: I'm gonna do horror? Horizontal, vertical, split.

01:51:00
<transcript>: Smaller and it's gonna be peacecale, proxy.

01:51:06
<transcript>: And then I'm gonna horizontally split this one.

01:51:10
<transcript>: I'm gonna do my Dev server, but first.

01:51:10
<transcript>: over here

01:51:12
<transcript>: Over here and kill this.

01:51:14
<transcript>: And.

01:51:17

<transcript>: The only thing I can get my wife that she cares about is.

02:10:30
<transcript>: less time of

02:10:53
<transcript>: as a reminder

02:10:56
<transcript>: As a reminder. Because do I want to show up for that.

02:10:56
<transcript>: aw

02:10:59
<transcript>: Aw, guess is going to be a.

02:11:01
<transcript>: Gain.

02:11:01
<transcript>: multip

02:11:03
<transcript>: Multiplayer where you log in.

02:11:16
<transcript>: And you're presenting you in a competitor presented with AWS service Icons, and you have to guess which one it is. Whoever guesses first wins that round. It's like that right. 80 View AW. Guess.

02:11:22
<transcript>: Cubic. Cuba's Ever heard of forgotten your name. I'm so sorry. Cuba. Cubis.

02:11:26
<transcript>: Cubis, I think came up with the name.

02:11:31
<transcript>: And we've just gotten to know each other. Cubas. So if it's not Cuba's, I'm so sorry.

02:11:31
<transcript>: i did this in a

02:11:36
<transcript>: I did this in a person too. Like when I meet people so that are remembering names.

02:11:38
<transcript>: So.

02:11:39
qubiz: Yes that's it

02:11:42
karrbs: Sounds like my style of learning aws lol

02:11:45
karrbs: names are hard

02:11:47
<transcript>: It's gonna be built with Cuba's. That's it cool. Cuba's came up with the name. We bought all the domains. We're gonna build it.

02:11:47
<transcript>: yeah

02:11:48
stroopwafel26: geohot did something like that but with tic tac toe https://github.com/geohot/twitchtactoe

02:11:53
<transcript>: Yeah, names are hard. That's exactly that carbs. It's gonna be built with T three stack.

02:11:53
<transcript>: so that's a whole purpose

02:11:57
<transcript>: So that's a whole purpose. I want to build something new with T three stack just to play with it.

02:11:57
purrplish: Sounds fun but I will be horrible at it LUL

02:12:06
<transcript>: So as we're doing on Thursday, that'll be the whole thing. I think we've been barely touched it last train. Like we just kind of like getting familiar with the project structure.

02:12:07
stroopwafel26: he's using peerjs

02:12:12
<transcript>: So really, I think Thursday will be like a single session. Build the whole thing front to back.

02:12:18
<transcript>: Geo Hot did something like that. But with tic Tok toe.

02:12:18
<transcript>: what is this

02:12:19
<transcript>: What is this.

02:12:22
<transcript>: Pure JS.

02:12:25
<transcript>: Maybe I want to use beer task.

02:12:31
<transcript>: Lives on IPFS. You find you play? What is this.

02:12:39
<transcript>: See, you have to wait for a Pier. Oh, cool.

02:12:43
<transcript>: I'm clicking a user to challenge them.

02:12:43
<transcript>: i'm

02:12:45
schrew: Gm!

02:12:47
<transcript>: I'm playing Tiktik toe. I didn't wasn't.

02:12:49
<transcript>: I just saw.

02:12:49
<transcript>: yes

02:12:52
<transcript>: Yesterday prime stream true. Good morning.

02:12:52
stroopwafel26: geohot is the dude that jailbroke the iphone first

02:12:57
stroopwafel26: and the playstation

02:12:57
<transcript>: I think Prime Yesterday was building Ticto, wasn't he? Was he following this guy.

02:13:00
<transcript>: Oh, he broke? He jebrook the first iphone? Wow.

02:13:11
<transcript>: Okay. Cool. Well, this is a good find. Might need to look at that for the pure JS stuff. I'm not sure what you're JS's.

02:13:26
<transcript>: Well, let's go back. I'm gonna just spit a little more. I'm probably not that fun. I'm really tired of, like doing environmental stuff. Like setting up stuff in my environment. On stream. I just I stream the whole time I'm in my office. So.

02:13:26
<transcript>: you end up seeing

02:13:28
<transcript>: You end up seeing stuff.

02:13:28
<transcript>: but maybe

02:13:29
stroopwafel26: peerjs is WebRTC

02:13:30
<transcript>: But maybe it's less than ideal.

02:13:43
<transcript>: I could stream less. I'm not actually right now. I'm doing four days, so I stop doing Wednesday. You know, I'm not actually close to three days so I can really get started on YouTube. I feel like I'm not really gonna make progress on YouTube or many things if I stream every single day.

02:13:43
<transcript>: so i might cut out

02:13:44
<transcript>: So I might cut out.

02:13:46
corfliss: Ah yes, George Hotz.

02:13:47
<transcript>: Well, let me ask you this.

02:13:47
<transcript>: if

02:13:48
<transcript>: If.

02:13:52
<transcript>: I only stream three days a week. What day should I cut out.

02:13:52
<transcript>: i stream

02:14:00
<transcript>: I stream right now Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday. What day should I not stream if I want to claim another day to get more done.

02:14:04
<transcript>: I might get more done. I mean like do things that are just not gonna be fun to watch.

02:14:04
<transcript>: i feel

02:14:07
schrew: Cutout monday is my preference :)

02:14:08
<transcript>: I feel like right now I just I put you all through it.

02:14:08
<transcript>: even if it's

02:14:11
laytanl_: Monday

02:14:16
<transcript>: Even if it's not that bad if you want to set up tmux and you cut out Monday, okay, true. That's good to hear Monday. Another Monday. Okay.

02:14:19
laytanl_: I can't join anyway

02:14:19
corfliss: Monday

02:14:19
<transcript>: So Monday is not a great day to watch streams, so I'm gathering.

02:14:23
<transcript>: I.

02:14:23
<transcript>: three monday

02:14:25
<transcript>: Three, Mondays.

02:14:27
<transcript>: It's unanimous.

02:14:32
stroopwafel26: I can't join Thursdays hehe

02:14:33
schrew: might be worth checking stream stats, fwiw

02:14:35
purrplish: Monday

02:14:36
<transcript>: Okay. So we might do that soon. I'll probably be here. No, I won't be here next Monday. So I'm on vacation Monday and Tuesday.

02:14:36
<transcript>: a stroop can't

02:14:39
<transcript>: A Stroop. Can't join Thursdays. Okay.

02:14:39
<transcript>: stream

02:14:40
log1400: Wednesday Thursday Friday

02:14:40
<transcript>: Stream stats.

02:14:47
<transcript>: Maybe I'll check streams that so let's that tell me. Log says don't stream Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.

02:14:47
<transcript>: so just

02:14:49
<transcript>: So just don't stream basically.

02:14:49
nexxeln: hihi

02:14:57
<transcript>: Hi. Hi. Next one. Hey. So next one we because I have a short stream today.

02:14:57
<transcript>: i'm not actually

02:15:00
log1400: xd

02:15:03
<transcript>: I'm not actually gonna work on Thursday. Next one is going to be an all day stream. Well 6 hours is my day.

02:15:13
log1400: no, i mean, you ask about 3 day

02:15:18
<transcript>: Building. Aw, guess with P three stack today, we got kind of a late start, and it's a short stream. It's a whole thing I lost about with my wife. I explained a second ago, so we're just gonna mess with my TeamMax configs more, and then I'm gonna be done here in, like, 30 minutes.

02:15:18
<transcript>: forty minutes

02:15:19
<transcript>: 40 minutes.

02:15:25
nexxeln: ohh

02:15:25
<transcript>: Oh, that's about three days. I got you. Those are the three days you'd want me to stream Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, I gotcha.

02:15:25
<transcript>: yeah

02:15:28
<transcript>: Yeah. So next week I'll be out Monday, Tuesday.

02:15:28
<transcript>: offstream

02:15:32
<transcript>: Offstream Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Next week.

02:15:35
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:15:35
<transcript>: but then maybe

02:15:48
<transcript>: But then maybe following the following week, I might start streaming just three days a week, just so I can have more time for YouTube and other things that I want to pursue. Cool. Let's let's mess with this stupid Dracula. I can't believe this is the default.

02:15:48
<transcript>: except the stupid

02:15:55
stroopwafel26: what about you stream monday to sunday MaxLOL

02:15:58
log1400: How was the experience with t3 stack yesterday?

02:15:59
<transcript>: Except the stupid smiley face in the bottom. It drives me crazy. I mean, I appreciate all the open source work. Thank you so much for making a Dracula theme. Just why? With the with the smiley face. I don't understand.

02:16:04
<transcript>: Power Lines, symbols.

02:16:06
<transcript>: Window, flags.

02:16:09
<transcript>: What are window, flags.

02:16:11
<transcript>: Refresh rate.

02:16:21
<transcript>: Okay, switch the left smiley icon. It can accept sessions, smiley, window, or any character. Okay.

02:16:24
<transcript>: What would session be.

02:16:29
<transcript>: So.

02:16:32
nexxeln: i would recommend session

02:16:37
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:16:37
nexxeln: that will the name of your session name

02:16:41
<transcript>: Here's our Dracula Show power line. False.

02:16:41
<transcript>: get weather

02:16:43
<transcript>: Get weather time.

02:16:45
<transcript>: Paste. This.

02:16:45
<transcript>: session

02:16:46
<transcript>: Session.

02:16:50
<transcript>: What is that.

02:16:54
<transcript>: Zero. So it's just saying the section number that I'm in.

02:16:54
<transcript>: probably

02:16:59
<transcript>: Probably always gonna be in session Zero. Let's see what window looks like.

02:17:13
<transcript>: So just as the name of the current window. But I can, like, see that right there. Right. I kind of don't want to show the available windows that's more my style.

02:17:13
<transcript>: just

02:17:16
<transcript>: Just to not take up the space. Can I do that.

02:17:17
nexxeln: you can also name sessions with meaningful words

02:17:19
<transcript>: High contrast Pain border.

02:17:22
<transcript>: Can I move it to the top.

02:17:22
<transcript>: can i move this whole

02:17:25
<transcript>: Can I move this whole thing to the top.

02:17:33
<transcript>: Like you're telling me, the Dracula plugin, this is all just a Dracula plugin. Or this is a different plugin that Dracula is messing with.

02:17:33
<transcript>: anyone now

02:17:35
<transcript>: Anyone now.

02:17:37
<transcript>: Status? Bar.

02:17:50
stroopwafel26: set-option -g status-position top

02:17:56
<transcript>: Name of your session. Name also name sessions with meaningful words that make sense.

02:17:59
<transcript>: Oh, there you go. So, option G status. Position. Top.

02:17:59
<transcript>: so

02:18:04
<transcript>: So is the status bar thing, not a plugin. Is that just built in.

02:18:12
stroopwafel26: it's built-in yeah

02:18:20
stroopwafel26: dracula theme just adds stuff to it

02:18:22
<transcript>: Is that a built in thing? Okay.

02:18:33
<transcript>: So do I want any of these plugins? Do I want the weather in the time, in my thing.

02:18:38
<transcript>: But I'm gonna have time. I want to be shorter.

02:18:49
<transcript>: Swap date today month not doing that.

02:18:53
nexxeln: i just have date time and battery

02:18:56
<transcript>: Not doing that.

02:19:03
<transcript>: Okay.

02:19:09
<transcript>: This is just kind of weird to me. This is kind of a weird plugin.

02:19:12
<transcript>: I don't think I want.

02:19:12
<transcript>: the weather

02:19:15
<transcript>: The weather there's a cool idea.

02:19:17
<transcript>: Yet why they did it.

02:19:17
<transcript>: but i'm not

02:19:19
<transcript>: But I'm not in love with it.

02:19:21
<transcript>: A lot of people like that. But.

02:19:27
<transcript>: I'm one of those people. So we have our windows. I kind of don't want to show the available windows, you know.

02:19:32
<transcript>: Get options.

02:19:48
<transcript>: You have date time and battery, so I'm on a Max studio so I don't have a battery, but you just have date time.

02:19:48
<transcript>: that's it

02:19:49
<transcript>: That's it.

02:19:50
stroopwafel26: I never liked this plugin, or any plugin, I changed the colors of my default statusbar to loosely match my terminal and I'm fine with that

02:19:53
<transcript>: Oh, Jime.

02:19:53
<transcript>: or what

02:19:54
<transcript>: Or what.

02:19:54
<transcript>: keep doing

02:19:58
<transcript>: Keep doing this. I keep accidentally putting Jays places.

02:19:58
<transcript>: and then finding out

02:19:59
<transcript>: And then finding out later.

02:20:01
purrplish: I have date time and server

02:20:06
corfliss: Your dracula plugins have a typo jime

02:20:06
<transcript>: No, it's still working. Yeah, I don't know if I need get. I'm being honest.

02:20:11
<transcript>: Okay. So we're just gonna put the time up there in the top, the date and time.

02:20:14
nexxeln: yeah ^ the thing i like about oh-my-tmux is tha it doesn't uses any plugins

02:20:16
<transcript>: Yeah. Thank you. Corpus. Yes, they did.

02:20:20
<transcript>: Just add stuff to it so I want to let's see tmux.

02:20:24
<transcript>: I want to.

02:20:26
<transcript>: Add.

02:20:30
<transcript>: Bar Don't Show session.

02:20:30
<transcript>: like i think

02:20:36
<transcript>: Like, I think it's my style to not have the sessions listed, and I just have to, like, move around in them and find them.

02:20:44
<transcript>: Satisfiguration.

02:20:52
<transcript>: Is putting us at the top. Terrible. I'm just so used to the bottom of my thing being.

02:20:55
<transcript>: Like this.

02:20:55
<transcript>: whatever

02:20:58
<transcript>: Whatever this plugin is called in NVM, and then.

02:20:58
<transcript>: where i type

02:21:03
<transcript>: Where I type. I'm just used to invent going to the bottom and it feels weird for it not to.

02:21:14

02:21:22

02:21:26
<transcript>: Oh current song interesting.

02:21:31
<transcript>: Oh, there you go. Stroop. Thank you.

02:21:38
<transcript>: And also next one. Thank you.

02:21:45
<transcript>: Oh, my team X doesn't use any plugins. Wow.

02:21:51
<transcript>: So I'll just straight configuring the builtin stuff.

02:22:04
<transcript>: Can you tell me this.

02:22:23
<transcript>: Well, I thought it looks like it went away for a second. Still showing. I'm sending Windows Status current format.

02:22:29
stroopwafel26: Sometimes I feel like I'm missing out by not using all these plugins but I'm very happy with using the defaults and figuring stuff out myself

02:22:46
<transcript>: Says use session there and I'm gonna trust him that I'm ever gonna create a second session.

02:22:50
<transcript>: Time. I want to show. Let's see what next.

02:22:50
<transcript>: one

02:22:52
<transcript>: One's link. Give me here.

02:23:01
corfliss: Question: ever heard about LibGDX for Java?

02:23:01

02:23:21
stroopwafel26: maybe it's set somewhere else as well

02:23:22
nexxeln: i think you're using tmux wrong, the most powerfull thing about tmux is returning to wherever you left off

02:23:23
<transcript>: Well.

02:23:31
<transcript>: Doesn't seem to be hiding it. Sometimes I feel like I'm missing out by not using all these plugins, and I'm very happy with using the defaults and bring yourself out myself.

02:23:36
<transcript>: Cordless. I don't know what that is for Java. Now.

02:23:46
<transcript>: Maybe it says somewhere else as well. Oh, maybe I'm using tmux wrong. Most Papa thing about tmux is returning to wherever you left off.

02:23:46
<transcript>: oh

02:23:47
<transcript>: Oh.

02:23:50
<transcript>: I'm probably using your own then.

02:23:55
<transcript>: I guess I've been doing a lot of research.

02:23:55
<transcript>: changes

02:23:58

02:24:02
<transcript>: Have it just not gotten there.

02:24:54
<transcript>: That's cool. Yeah. Good idea.

02:24:59
<transcript>: That's a great idea. Just like have aliases for all your projects.

02:25:02
<transcript>: Love it.

02:25:07
<transcript>: Okay.

02:25:07
<transcript>: so

02:25:15
<transcript>: So I think I think I will be attaching to sessions and using it like a normal person once I'm not just restarting it constantly.

02:25:15
nexxeln: there's also tmuxinator that does this all for you

02:25:19
<transcript>: My current team exception has been running for 14 days.

02:25:26
<transcript>: Team Xinator does all this for you. Oh like it does the aliases and stuff.

02:25:32
<transcript>: So windows status current format did not work. We got to restart.

02:25:36
<transcript>: About the restart. Let's restart again.

02:25:44
stroopwafel26: shouldn't have to restart for that

02:25:46
<transcript>: Kill server. I know this is not how I should use it, but we're trying to figure out. Okay, fish. Now it still shows. Yeah, still shows. The windows.

02:25:52
<transcript>: Yeah, I still haven't worked out in my brain. How.

02:25:56
<transcript>: How I'm gonna use tmux in terms of number of sessions.

02:25:59
<transcript>: I haven't worked out my.

02:26:04
<transcript>: List. I worked at my workflow, you know, but I know I could rename.

02:26:08
<transcript>: I could rename that session. How.

02:26:17
<transcript>: Do I rename a session.

02:26:27
stroopwafel26: man tmux

02:26:31
karrbs: I guess the next step is to use it and make a list of things you would want to change and then what is most important sylessThink

02:26:37
<transcript>: Man Tim X. Thank you. I'm such a not Linux person.

02:26:40
stroopwafel26: prefix $

02:26:44
nexxeln: tmux rename-session -t oldname new name

02:26:48
<transcript>: Files. Okay.

02:26:56
<transcript>: Default Key Binding Don't care, don't care, don't care.

02:26:59
<transcript>: Rename.

02:27:01
stroopwafel26: you can search in 'man' like vim :P

02:27:08
<transcript>: Rename session.

02:27:08
<transcript>: t old name

02:27:11
<transcript>: T old name new name okay.

02:27:16
purrplish: I have scripts that create a named session for a project, makes my splits, and opens the directories in the splits the way I like it.

02:27:19
<transcript>: I guess the next step is to use it and make a list of things you would want to change. And then what is most important? Yeah. It's a great call. Carbs.

02:27:20
stroopwafel26: prefix $ renames the current session

02:27:20
karrbs: I use linux but I am not a terminal editor user

02:27:24
<transcript>: I'm just kind of in that early, just like that first.

02:27:32
<transcript>: Those first moments where, you know, there's things you want to change. There's already things I just kind of want to, like, settle in a little bit.

02:27:40
<transcript>: Like for instance, I don't want.

02:27:47
<transcript>: These dice. Format. Zero.

02:28:01
<transcript>: How about this.

02:28:03
corfliss: I need to install Arch, with WSL if possible.

02:28:06
<transcript>: Oh, that got rid of the whole status bar.

02:28:24
<transcript>: Once the Sasbar. I just thought I could maybe not show.

02:28:26
<transcript>: You, Max.

02:28:32
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

02:28:43
nexxeln: i think the dracula plugin is messing with that status bar stuff, thats why you aren't able to disable windows

02:28:45
<transcript>: So ever satisfy I don't know maybe I just give up on that.

02:28:47
stroopwafel26: set -g window-status-current-format '' set -g window-status-format ''  this works on my tmux

02:28:48
<transcript>: Prefix.

02:28:52
<transcript>: Dollar sign Renames current session session. Oh, that's good to know. Okay.

02:28:52
<transcript>: so if

02:28:54
<transcript>: So if I want to rename.

02:28:58
<transcript>: This is going to be now.

02:28:58
<transcript>: def

02:29:02
<transcript>: Default. It's gonna be my default session. I'm just gonna have a default session.

02:29:11
<transcript>: I've scripted create a name session for a project, make my splits and opens the directories and slits the way I like it.

02:29:14
<transcript>: Purplish.

02:29:16
<transcript>: You can search.

02:29:21
stroopwafel26: @nexxeln yep

02:29:31
<transcript>: And man like them. Yeah. Yeah. If I figured that out, Stroop, I actually did figured it out all by myself. And then I saw your comment you're dragged to a plugin is messing with that status for stuff. That's why you're that makes sense. That makes sense. Next one.

02:29:31
<transcript>: said g

02:29:36
<transcript>: Said G in description. This works for my two X. Yeah, I think it's the Dracula.

02:29:51
<transcript>: Just try this. We'll try it. T. Max. Dracula.

02:29:53
<transcript>: Hide.

02:29:58
<transcript>: Hide my window.

02:29:59
<transcript>: Name.

02:30:10
nexxeln: but i think having the windows is helpful

02:30:14
stroopwafel26: I'm gonna to actual dracula colors but without the plugin in my tmux.conf now brb

02:30:15
nexxeln: it gets messy real quick

02:30:15
<transcript>: Window names enable. Window flags.

02:30:18
<transcript>: Just refresh rate. What are window flags.

02:30:22
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:30:31
<transcript>: What's true do.

02:30:39
<transcript>: It's got like a little star. Like something's changed in it. What's that star mean.

02:30:41
<transcript>: I don't know.

02:30:43
<transcript>: Crazy about it.

02:30:51
<transcript>: So Noing. And then like, I'll save the file and I'll reload, and it won't change.

02:30:52
stroopwafel26: * is "this is the current one selected"

02:30:56
<transcript>: The reload sometimes works for certain things, but for lots of things. It does not.

02:31:00
<transcript>: Or maybe I have to explicitly say false.

02:31:03
<transcript>: I did it. Okay.

02:31:07
<transcript>: Good semester real quick gonna.

02:31:13
<transcript>: Actual Draco colors but without the plugin in my TX Tmax config now BRB.

02:31:21
<transcript>: Thing. Having the window is helpful. Yeah. Next one. I think it. I think of it like my it's like a Neil. Them.

02:31:21
<transcript>: if i

02:31:25
<transcript>: If I open multiple buffers in neovem like.

02:31:25
<transcript>: forgot

02:31:29
<transcript>: Forgot I was in this thing. Let's open.

02:31:29
<transcript>: the

02:31:30
<transcript>: The.

02:31:35
<transcript>: Yarn or feature. So if I open like multiple buffers.

02:31:35
<transcript>: in my neove

02:31:55
<transcript>: In my neovem. I don't like showing like a buffer line. That's just a stylistic thing for me. I just feel guilty when I have a list of all the things I have open. I wish I could do it in Chrome. I wish I could not have tabs. And just like I have to always open a new thing. Maybe you can turn off tabs. I don't know. This just makes me feel guilty. I see all these tabs. I think. Oh, I should have closed those when I had them open. I only.

02:31:55
<transcript>: need it for a

02:31:57
<transcript>: Need it for a short time most of the time.

02:32:05
nexxeln: use a tab manager

02:32:07
<transcript>: Yeah. So I kind of like, prefer not displaying those lists of things, but I guess this might be different. Timox is a little more intentional. I'm choosing to create windows for each thing.

02:32:12
<transcript>: I guess I wish I at least could maybe remove the numbers.

02:32:12
<transcript>: but i guess those

02:32:16
<transcript>: But I guess those are also helpful if I have lots of windows so like.

02:32:16
<transcript>: if i

02:32:19
<transcript>: If I create a new window and this is gonna be.

02:32:24
<transcript>: Well, let's see. This one is gonna be.

02:32:26
karrbs: right click a tab and close all lol

02:32:29
<transcript>: Let's open up, let's just get my project ready for Thursday, so I'm gonna open up.

02:32:29
<transcript>: let's go

02:32:31
laytanl_: Didn't you have an invite for the browser company?

02:32:33
<transcript>: Let's go to CD yeah. Aw, guess.

02:32:35
<transcript>: In them.

02:32:38
<transcript>: I would have my editor.

02:32:38
<transcript>: or nvm

02:32:40
<transcript>: Or NVM open. I would have.

02:32:48
<transcript>: This one will do? Oh, no, no, see, I don't know what I'm gonna use? Oops, I did not mean to split that.

02:32:52
<transcript>: Yes. So I don't know.

02:32:52
<transcript>: i'm still not

02:32:55
<transcript>: I'm still not sold online.

02:32:59
<transcript>: I just don't know my workflow, and that's part of the problem.

02:33:02
stroopwafel26: @laytanl_ I do, don't like the browser all that much at this point

02:33:03
<transcript>: What did I just do? I created a new pain. I didn't even mean to.

02:33:06
<transcript>: No. I created a new window.

02:33:06
<transcript>: is that a new window

02:33:07
<transcript>: Is that a new window.

02:33:09
<transcript>: Or a pain.

02:33:14
<transcript>: I think it's a new way I knew I opened a new alacrity. I don't even know what I did.

02:33:16
<transcript>: What do I do.

02:33:18
<transcript>: Size of this.

02:33:21
nexxeln: i got an invite but i don't have mac lmao

02:33:25
<transcript>: No, that's not. Is that a T mock pain? What is that.

02:33:36
<transcript>: There must be a T. Max window paint. It's a T Max pane. Okay.

02:33:36
<transcript>: so conducing

02:33:38
<transcript>: So conducing.

02:33:43
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, I do have the browser company. So I have Arc the browser. Arc.

02:33:44
laytanl_: @stroopwafel26 Oh that's too bad, was looking forward to having better browsers

02:33:49
<transcript>: Use a Tab Manager, right click a tab and close all.

02:33:52
<transcript>: Oh, you mean all these? Yeah.

02:33:54
<transcript>: That's a good call.

02:33:56
<transcript>: Don't have a Mac.

02:33:56
<transcript>: i was looking forward to

02:33:58
<transcript>: I was looking forward to having better browsers.

02:33:58
<transcript>: yeah yeah

02:34:00
<transcript>: Yeah, Yeah.

02:34:09
<transcript>: I played this a little bit Stroop, and I don't know. I don't know if I'm sold or not. There's some ideas about it that I like.

02:34:09
<transcript>: so i'm gonna close

02:34:10
<transcript>: So I'm gonna close this pain.

02:34:16
<transcript>: Yes. So when I created a new pain, how did I do that? I don't even remember anymore.

02:34:16
<transcript>: i think

02:34:18
<transcript>: I think it was.

02:34:18
<transcript>: leader

02:34:19
<transcript>: Leader.

02:34:25
<transcript>: Leaders C. Creates a new window, right.

02:34:33
<transcript>: But then new pains? It's V and H. Right? So control? V? Yeah, that vertical splits.

02:34:33
<transcript>: okay

02:34:34
<transcript>: Okay.

02:34:38
stroopwafel26: there's definitly some UI ideas I really like but it feels like it has an identity crisis

02:34:44
<transcript>: Let's see. So the difference in windows and panes and what I want to put in the.

02:34:46
<transcript>: Questions that I have.

02:34:52
<transcript>: Like show the session. Just be. I think sessions I should do per project. I think that makes sense.

02:35:02
<transcript>: I think that makes sense. I think per project. So like this session.

02:35:02
<transcript>: i'm gonna

02:35:09
<transcript>: I'm gonna do leader I'm gonna rename this session. Eight abuse guest AW, guess.

02:35:09
<transcript>: this

02:35:11
<transcript>: This is my AW guest session.

02:35:21
<transcript>: And I want to detach. I can go back here TeamMax list. I've got a to be guess I could do a new team X. Is that how you do it? Just like that.

02:35:27
<transcript>: List. Yeah. So now I've got this new one.

02:35:32
<transcript>: And if I do attach is it just attached to the first one.

02:35:44
<transcript>: Now I've just got Tmax or just AW guest Pux attach. Okay, so I'm in AW guess I'm gonna do windows.

02:35:44
<transcript>: and then

02:35:49
nexxeln: tmux a attaches the to last tmux session you were in

02:35:55
<transcript>: And then pains. So maybe I'll have, like, an envim window. Okay, hear me out. I've got this invent window. This where I'm gonna work my editing. And then I'm gonna have a window.

02:35:55
<transcript>: for

02:35:56
<transcript>: For.

02:35:59
<transcript>: Maybe like.

02:36:02
nexxeln: i suck at typing omg

02:36:02
<transcript>: We'll call this one.

02:36:07
<transcript>: Processes.

02:36:13
<transcript>: You might say it attached. Just the last two xssions you were in. Okay, that makes sense.

02:36:22
<transcript>: That makes sense. I still have, like, processes. Maybe. And I'll split this into some pain. So like, I'll have a pnpm run Dev in here.

02:36:22
<transcript>: oh

02:36:24
<transcript>: Oh no CD.

02:36:26
<transcript>: In it.

02:36:30
<transcript>: So I'll run down Devin here, and then I'll VSplit.

02:36:34
<transcript>: All these split.

02:36:34
<transcript>: and

02:36:36
<transcript>: And have my.

02:36:36
<transcript>: p scale

02:36:37
<transcript>: P scale.

02:36:37
<transcript>: connect

02:36:46
<transcript>: Connect. So I'll have this thing running. Maybe all for Azime split to run more stuff or I'll just leave this one open. I got the terminal I can play with.

02:36:49
stroopwafel26: woosh that tmux dracula plugin runs a shell script every time you open tmux to set options at runtime, this is also probably why it messes with tmux reload for you

02:36:51
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:36:59
<transcript>: Okay. So then I want to go back to here. Then maybe I'd have so I have processes. I don't really need another one.

02:37:02
<transcript>: Okay. So we have Inv.

02:37:06
<transcript>: inventory

02:37:07
<transcript>: Inventory.

02:37:15
<transcript>: This is where I would edit. I would come over here if I need to do terminal things like I want to get status. I'm gonna do all that, right.

02:37:21
<transcript>: Are you serious? Droop.

02:37:21
<transcript>: it run

02:37:29
<transcript>: It runs a shell script every time you open tmucks set options at runtime. This is also probably messes with tmux reload for you.

02:37:29
<transcript>: so

02:37:33
stroopwafel26: https://github.com/dracula/tmux/blob/master/scripts/dracula.sh

02:37:34
<transcript>: So what if we didn't use the Dracula plugin? What if what if.

02:37:34
<transcript>: regular

02:37:37
<transcript>: Regular colors. What if we just got the colors.

02:37:45
<transcript>: We didn't do this stupid plugin. I just don't think it's very good. I feel like the Dracula authors.

02:37:45
<transcript>: i don't know

02:37:51
<transcript>: I don't know. Did they sanction this thing? It's on the Dracula Webpage. It's just. I don't know about it.

02:37:51
<transcript>: not

02:37:58
<transcript>: Not a fan. I expect a Dracula theme to just change some colors and then get out of the way, you know.

02:37:58
<transcript>: maybe

02:38:00
<transcript>: Maybe this is one.

02:38:02
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:38:08
karrbs: Some of the dracula themes are bad

02:38:09
<transcript>: If there's gonna be somebody who's made a minimal one that doesn't touch all these things.

02:38:21
<transcript>: There's now an official Dracula theme. Is that best, though.

02:38:21
<transcript>: it's best

02:38:28
<transcript>: It's best. What's task worker does this thing come with Tag Warrior? And why is it including that just to give me colors.

02:38:32
<transcript>: Anyone anyone thinks this is good.

02:38:32
<transcript>: nineteen

02:38:34
<transcript>: 19 stars.

02:38:34
<transcript>: two

02:38:36
<transcript>: Two 90 Forks.

02:38:42
<transcript>: How can I have that many Forks in that few stars.

02:38:45
<transcript>: Seems rude.

02:38:48
backkflipp: Hello

02:38:51
<transcript>: Top down terminally.

02:38:54
<transcript>: Zsh.

02:38:56
<transcript>: Oh my zsh.

02:39:00
backkflipp: How is everyone_

02:39:03
purrplish: Big configs are bloated if you just want a basic colored status bar.

02:39:09
<transcript>: Hey, back flip. We're doing well. We're messing with tmux today. I've just got a short stream.

02:39:13
<transcript>: Some of the Dracular themes are bad, it turns out.

02:39:15
<transcript>: Turns out.

02:39:23
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't want all this. I just want to change the colors to be Dracula colors, you know.

02:39:29
<transcript>: What am I doing? This thing. I'm looking for Dracula.

02:39:31
nexxeln: i would just copy over the dracula colours into the config file

02:39:34
<transcript>: Change you think Jacula.

02:39:41
<transcript>: Emojs and Dracula Themes let's see.

02:39:45
<transcript>: They use just the Dracula plugin.

02:39:47
stroopwafel26: My current statusbar isn't offensive in dracula

02:39:48
<transcript>: Yeah, yeah, they did.

02:39:50
<transcript>: Okay.

02:39:56
<transcript>: I don't love it.

02:39:58
<transcript>: Don't love it.

02:40:14
<transcript>: What's riced out mean? Not nearly as riced out as yours.

02:40:14
<transcript>: is that gen

02:40:19
<transcript>: Is that Gen Z tank term hang on gin Z rice out.

02:40:25
backkflipp: Once you start using tmux + neovim on a daily basis you will feel the Master of the Universe.

02:40:26
<transcript>: Does that terminology from Gin Z.

02:40:26
nexxeln: like linux ricing

02:40:28
<transcript>: Maybe not.

02:40:29
corfliss: Still fixing tmux?

02:40:35
<transcript>: Like Linux racing.

02:40:35
<transcript>: oh linux

02:40:37
<transcript>: Oh, Linux, ricing.

02:40:37
<transcript>: once you start

02:40:37
nexxeln: no its old terminology

02:40:42
<transcript>: Once you start using Tmax plus ne of them on a daily basis, you will feel the Master of the universe.

02:40:42
<transcript>: i like

02:40:45
<transcript>: I like doing shrimp. I will feel the math.

02:40:52
purrplish: No riced has been around forever for tweaking your setup a lot

02:40:53
<transcript>: Yeah. I want to just copy the Dragon codes into my config file. That's exactly what I want. Next one. How do I do that.

02:40:53
<transcript>: where are the

02:40:55
<transcript>: Where are the Jack yellow colors.

02:40:58
<transcript>: It's old terminology.

02:41:01
<transcript>: Rice has been around forever for tweaking your setup a lot okay.

02:41:01
<transcript>: never heard of that

02:41:03
<transcript>: Never heard of that.

02:41:03
laytanl_: its like how aesthetic your setup is

02:41:07
<transcript>: So can I just copy the colors? Too much config.

02:41:11
<transcript>: How aesthetic your setup is. Okay.

02:41:18
<transcript>: So many opinions.

02:41:23
<transcript>: Like, what is all this? Just Dracula, right.

02:41:27
<transcript>: Wait. Now, this is this person's whole config.

02:41:30
<transcript>: Facebook Path picker.

02:41:33
<transcript>: Akula.

02:41:36
<transcript>: Wait.

02:41:36
<transcript>: color

02:41:37
<transcript>: Color.

02:41:41
<transcript>: Is there Dracula color in this.

02:41:46
<transcript>: That's going to be everything.

02:41:49
<transcript>: To see some color Hex codes or something.

02:41:56
<transcript>: Okay. I'm out of that one. So does this thing list the colors? Maybe.

02:41:56
<transcript>: let's

02:41:56
rrittenhouse: I've heard "riced out" back in the day when people were modding their cars with exhausts and whatnot.

02:41:57
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:41:58
purrplish: # Dracula Color Pallette   white='#f8f8f2'   gray='#44475a'   dark_gray='#282a36'   light_purple='#bd93f9'   dark_purple='#6272a4'   cyan='#8be9fd'   green='#50fa7b'   orange='#ffb86c'   red='#ff5555'   pink='#ff79c6'   yellow='#f1fa8c'

02:42:20
<transcript>: Like, could I live with this? I guess. What do I not like about this? I guess we've gotten this down. Okay. If I'm okay with showing those, I don't like that. It runs a shell script every time. Open beat. Like that seems bad.

02:42:29
<transcript>: But.

02:42:33
<transcript>: But it does give me the colors.

02:42:33
<transcript>: we got some

02:42:36
backkflipp: Why is it bad?

02:42:39
<transcript>: We got some Dragon colors up here on this bar. Is that the only Tim X thing that's steamed like? Is that the only thing that has colors, even.

02:42:43
<transcript>: Why is it bad? I don't know. Maybe it's not bad.

02:42:47
<transcript>: I written. House. Welcome to chat.

02:42:47
<transcript>: it's nice to see

02:42:49
<transcript>: It's nice to see a new chatter here.

02:42:50
stroopwafel26: looks like it yeah, i'm porting it to regular .tmux.conf

02:42:57
<transcript>: You've heard Rice out back in the day, people were modding their cars with big sauce and whatnot? Okay.

02:42:58
rrittenhouse: Thanks :)

02:43:03
<transcript>: Dracula Color palette. White grade. So that's all the colors. But how do I set them.

02:43:12
<transcript>: Looks like it. Yeah, I'm porting it to regular tmux config. Okay, let me know Stroop when you do that, and I might try out yours.

02:43:12
<transcript>: might try

02:43:14
<transcript>: Might try it out.

02:43:20
backkflipp: Linux is almost basically that, shell scripts running constantly.

02:43:24
<transcript>: But for now, we'll just keep it. So what? I not know and not like about Timucks. I guess I'm still figuring out my workflow. Nexo VEC. Thanks so much for follow.

02:43:28
<transcript>: So my let's see that changes.

02:43:31
<transcript>: Toggles between windows.

02:43:31
<transcript>: can i also just do

02:43:32
<transcript>: Can I also just do like.

02:43:32
<transcript>: that to go

02:43:34
nexovec: You're welcome!

02:43:35
<transcript>: That to go to second window? Yeah, Yeah.

02:43:35
<transcript>: if i create a new

02:43:41
<transcript>: If I create a new window and then a new window and then a new window I can do like.

02:43:41
<transcript>: three to go

02:43:42
<transcript>: Three to go to three.

02:43:42
<transcript>: one

02:43:44
<transcript>: One to the one. Okay.

02:43:44
<transcript>: not to be confused

02:43:48
<transcript>: Not to be confused with spaces which I can do like that.

02:43:54
<transcript>: Oh, Geez, so many things there's spaces in my Mac.

02:43:54
<transcript>: and

02:44:03
<transcript>: And each space has apps running which are in their own window. If I'm running lacarde that might have TML.

02:44:03
<transcript>: sessions

02:44:06
<transcript>: Sessions. Each session might have.

02:44:16
backkflipp: I use shell scripts for everything, my desktop status bar is running shell scripts every second.

02:44:23
nexovec: Is there any alternative to tmux?

02:44:23
purrplish: prefix n is next window for tmux

02:44:24
tayloreddev: this is why you need a mac studio LUL

02:44:26
<transcript>: Windows. Each window might have pains. Each pane might have envym, which has V splits and H splits. And, oh, my word, it's enough to make you want to screen. I'm getting anxiety. I'm literally, like, I'm anxious. I'm have to go do some breathing exercises to just get over the containers, all of the things that go all the way down and then.

02:44:26
<transcript>: trying

02:44:29
<transcript>: Trying to navigate them all with your keyboard.

02:44:32
<transcript>: This is why you need a Mac studio. Exactly.

02:44:32
rrittenhouse: I've used byobu, is that similar?

02:44:37
<transcript>: Prefix in you. I got that one.

02:44:37
<transcript>: i was just

02:44:40
<transcript>: I was just trying to see if the numbers came in handy. Like if I could actually.

02:44:40
<transcript>: so

02:44:42
<transcript>: So in and P right.

02:44:45
rrittenhouse: I think it uses tmux or something. I've not explored this area much.

02:44:46
<transcript>: I was just trying to figure out what are my options here.

02:44:51
corfliss: Take a deep breath.

02:44:52
<transcript>: And the answer is too many. There are too many options. I do like this. So, Timux, I'm sold.

02:44:52
<transcript>: i'm sold on t

02:44:54
<transcript>: I'm sold on Tmax.

02:45:00
<transcript>: I knew I needed to get here. I just didn't know it'd be this soon. But Cafe showed up today, and he said.

02:45:00
<transcript>: ready

02:45:05
<transcript>: Ready? I'm ready to just teach you? You're ready? He told me I was ready.

02:45:05
<transcript>: and then here we

02:45:07
<transcript>: And then here we are.

02:45:07
<transcript>: i'm

02:45:08
backkflipp: Tmux on a mac is essential

02:45:08
faiataiga: byobu is a wrapper for screen or tmux. so pretty similar

02:45:15
backkflipp: Yes, you are ready.

02:45:16
<transcript>: I'm saying he cafes. I if you're a woman. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't assume your pronouns. I just jumped to conclusions.

02:45:23
<transcript>: I've used bioboo. Is that similar? I don't know. I don't know what it is.

02:45:27
<transcript>: It's. There an alternative alternative team ax is that we're talking about.

02:45:30
<transcript>: So we're talking about.

02:45:35
<transcript>: Shellips running constantly that makes sense.

02:45:43
<transcript>: Think it uses too much or something. I'm not explored this area much. Take a deep breath.

02:45:46
backkflipp: The force is within you.

02:45:51
<transcript>: Tmux on a Mac is essential. Biobo is a wrapper for screen or tmux, so pretty similar.

02:45:54
<transcript>: The force is within me.

02:46:07
<transcript>: Thank you backflip. I think Calface has now gone to into lurk mode. He has taught me all he can teach me. Well, no, he's just he's he or she has given up. I'm teaching me anymore. Today they've decided that was enough.

02:46:13
<transcript>: So I'm gonna just practice some navigating around in Timuks, and then we're gonna call it here shortly.

02:46:16
<transcript>: That does that. What did that do.

02:46:25
andreull: you once told me "thanks man", however I was not offended, even though my preferred pronouns are  emperor/god

02:46:25
<transcript>: But did that do? Why did I hit L why did I think that would do something that navigate pains. There are no pains in this one. If I go to.

02:46:27
<transcript>: Two. Then I can.

02:46:27
<transcript>: no

02:46:28
<transcript>: No.

02:46:28
<transcript>: novigate

02:46:30
corfliss: !lurk to finish some LibGDX project.

02:46:31
<transcript>: Novigate pains. It's like that. Yeah.

02:46:37
<transcript>: Okay. So that case me there that takes me there if I'm gonna go down.

02:46:37
<transcript>: i'm just like

02:46:41
<transcript>: I'm just like that up, down, up, down.

02:46:46
<transcript>: Left. Okay, that feels good. I can navigate pains pretty smoothly.

02:46:46
<transcript>: that

02:46:48
<transcript>: That all feels good.

02:46:57
<transcript>: So what? I have multiple panes for my editor? Probably not, but if I want to increase the size of this window.

02:47:00
<transcript>: Saving it first try.

02:47:02
<transcript>: No.

02:47:05
<transcript>: That's gonna flip it over there.

02:47:09
<transcript>: Why something is conflicting with my.

02:47:14
<transcript>: New problem.

02:47:16
<transcript>: Oh, There it is.

02:47:16
<transcript>: i'm gonna

02:47:21
<transcript>: I'm gonna Resize my windows with SKD and you buy.

02:47:21
<transcript>: how i do it

02:47:22
<transcript>: How I do it.

02:47:28
<transcript>: Okay if I want to shift over to there my focus over to there.

02:47:34
<transcript>: I'm toggling through tabs because I.

02:47:34
<transcript>: browse

02:47:37
<transcript>: Browser also has tabs.

02:47:45
<transcript>: At least a tab is as low as it goes in a browser. There are no pains inside of my tabs or Windows or sessions or.

02:47:52
<transcript>: You once told me thanks man. However, I was not offended even though my preferred pronuns are Emperor and God. Okay, Andre.

02:47:54
<transcript>: Thank you, God.

02:48:04
andreull: lmao

02:48:07
andom: LUL

02:48:09
<transcript>: Lurk to finish some Lib GDX project. All right, you all don't have to command Lurk. You don't have to. I guess that just does. It does. Let me know. It's nice. Like, I know cow face is lurking now, and it's because he did the lurk.

02:48:09
<transcript>: command

02:48:10
<transcript>: Command.

02:48:10
<transcript>: and

02:48:13
<transcript>: And I hadn't seen you today. And how you doing.

02:48:17
<transcript>: What are your preferred pronouns and.

02:48:21
<transcript>: Would you also like to be called God? It'll get confusing if we have multiple gods here.

02:48:21
<transcript>: little poly

02:48:23
<transcript>: Little polytheism.

02:48:25
<transcript>: Be a little confusing.

02:48:25
<transcript>: if i say

02:48:31
<transcript>: If I say, oh, hey, God, what was the Anom? And Andre will be like, Yes.

02:48:31
<transcript>: can i help

02:48:33
<transcript>: Can I help.

02:48:36
<transcript>: You refer to me in my preferred pronoun.

02:48:43
<transcript>: Okay, let's just call it. We learned enough teammucks today. Feeling good.

02:49:55
<transcript>: Read me, Finna. Get some attention. Yeah, I need to get somebody.

02:49:55

02:50:12
nexxeln: i can

02:50:14
<transcript>: Yeah, I need somebody on my README who can I hire to, like, fix all my READMEs? Just like every project I actually need somebody to go through all my websites that I've published and fixed my Twitter handle because it links to a dead Twitter handle.

02:50:21
<transcript>: You can next one. I would. I would love. I feel like that's. Like Michael Jordan helping out.

02:50:25
<transcript>: A child learning how to play basketball, like.

02:50:25

<transcript>: Yeah. Now we'll talk about it. Maybe offline.

02:50:47
<transcript>: don't do a ton of work

02:50:57
<transcript>: Don't do a ton of work, but if you like immediately see things you can improve and that goes for everyone. I will love your PRS. Maybe there's even one right now. I should check. I haven't even looked.

02:50:57
<transcript>: it looked

02:50:59
karrbs: Store your socials in a db table solely for the handles and just have it pull it every time karrbsHaha

02:51:02
<transcript>: It looked if there's any PRS that I need to get to my balls on.

02:51:02
<transcript>: i will

02:51:09
<transcript>: I will most likely if I see your PR. I will do an LG. Tm. Looks good to me. And we will merge it.

02:51:09
<transcript>: so don't do anything

02:51:12
<transcript>: So don't do anything malicious. Please, because I don't look that closely.

02:51:23
nexxeln: can i dm you on discord?

02:51:25
<transcript>: All right. Thank you so much. Oh, that's a great idea, Carbs. Actually, I was gonna put that into public Dev, like, store all your social metadata in public Dev, and it automatically syncs like you OAuth to each of them, and it just keeps them up to date. I thought about doing that.

02:51:29
