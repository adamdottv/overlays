cowfacedev: @adamdotdev it's time you move to just chatting LUL

00:14:56
dmdboi: And he uses Linux

00:14:57

aj_stuyvenberg: I have it on good authority that Dax isn't actually using Arch and I3, but is in fact using a macbook pro and streams using virtualbox cause he doesn't wanna me found out.

00:18:45

thdxr: it's rare

00:20:33
smilingbig: KEKW

00:20:33
thdxr: but what's the deal with that

00:20:36
dmdboi: His insecurity has won

00:20:36

00:22:25
dmdboi: Adam has that Lego minifigure hair

00:22:41
spotmonk: are  you insecure about being insecure?

00:22:42
thdxr: you really don't know who's going to render that doesn't like you?

00:22:44
thdxr: think harder

00:22:45
samhuckaby: @sockthedev Sock sees through all

00:22:53
caiocodes: i wish my bank account was as full as my insecurities

00:23:40
adamdotdev: https://github.com/statmuse/statmuse.com

00:24:28
oskrm: us*

00:24:29
smilingbig: if you did launder money, would you tell us that you laundered money?

00:24:44
daneoshiga: not being able to follow much of the streams, trying to study frontend for better job opportunities, miss adam's streams

00:24:50
thdxr: that youtube video is from your channel and your hair looks good in it

00:24:58
adrnlnjnky: That's what I get for opening my mouth.

00:25:01
thdxr: and it also looked good in the "don't work at a startup video"

00:25:01
vagorge: why a rewrite with astro

00:25:04
warrenbuffering: Any thoughts on Azure/Azure's Cloud? Trying to decide between AWS or Azure on a personal project

00:25:07
thdxr: i know there's a story here

00:25:17
damko_dev: What is your biggest pain point with Elixir?

00:27:33
dmdboi: can't you just take it off and put another hairstyle on like a human minifigure?

00:28:04
mr_yan19: I like you and that's all that counts

00:28:22
smilingbig: thdxr KEKW

00:28:25
thdxr: there's like at least 4-5 people going to render who have beef with you

00:28:37
daneoshiga: btw, Ben Hayden and Chris started yet another podcast xD

00:29:08
mr_yan19: Should I buy a soda stream?  My wife drinks a crap tonn of bubly water but I don't really want more kitchen gadgets.

00:29:26
thdxr: we have one and we can store it away pretty hidden, don't leave it on the counter

00:29:38
tayloreddev: @oskrM RDS at a guess

00:29:38
warrenbuffering: @warrenbuffering SeemsGood

00:29:50
smilingbig: I only leave the gadgets out that I use all the time

00:30:14
smilingbig: LUL

00:30:16
sockthedev: i've been digging it

thdxr: wow that looks like 1000x better

00:30:29
thdxr: you're gonna get so many views now

00:30:40
sockthedev: dax is so trolling you now

00:30:49
laame: My hair is keeping me from streaming

00:30:50
thdxr: no i genuinely think that looks better

00:30:57
thdxr: i mean it's sloppy but it's the right direction

00:31:06
samhuckaby: woah, when did Adam start doing his hair? This stream is way better now.

00:31:23
sockthedev: LUL LUL

00:31:28
smilingbig: KEKW

00:31:33
oskrm: With RDS, Did you try to find a solution for them? To lower the cost??

00:31:35
i_watch_qt_streamers: why did you use elixir in statmuse

00:31:41
thdxr: adam isn't usually wrong but his take on elixir so wrong

00:32:45
jenswoeste: good afternoon @adamdotdev - polished stream as always.

00:33:01
caiocodes: SZA - Kill Bill is that song that goes "I just killed my ex, not the best idea". When we were talking about confessing crimes on twitch

00:33:18
dmdboi: Chat keeps jumping, he'll never catch up

00:34:00
smilingbig: KEKW that was great

00:34:02
thdxr: never say anything bad about elixir except that it doesn't have typesafety, capiche?

00:34:22
oskrm: dont read this

00:34:37
thdxr: no

00:34:39
samhuckaby: sick burn there

00:34:45
llebc: whats in the cup today

00:34:51
jenswoeste: depends on what you are doing.

00:34:54
naxodev: hey chat! hey adam!

00:34:55
smilingbig: building what?

00:35:02
whatizit: typesafety is overrated

00:35:03
thdxr: elixir is such light FP, good balance of not being too intellectual like you said

00:35:05
saint_pyotr: "one proficient with FP and one with something productive" LUL

00:35:06
thdxr: you just refuse to let it in

00:35:19
smilingbig: saint_pyotr KEKW

00:35:39
laame: What kind of projects younso for fun/exploration?

00:35:49
thdxr: elixir's enum module on its own will make you way more productive than TS

00:35:56
laame: Oh, autocorrect, you did me bad ..

00:36:00
warrenbuffering: drink the elixir

00:36:01
tomfoolery_1: Adam, thanks for the video about the startup. Was awesome.

00:36:08
oskrm: @laame younso

00:36:10

00:36:11
whatizit: wen polyglot programmer

00:36:20
caiocodes: https://electric-sql.com/docs/overview/technical-intro nice elixir project this is

00:36:20
samhuckaby: @smilingbig YES

00:36:20
thdxr: i'm rewriting rebase in elixir now

00:36:43
techsavvytravvy: talking is hard tbf

00:36:46
jenswoeste: I find OCaml useful when doing hardcore algorithms.  For UI etc etc I would probably go for something OO

00:36:49
thdxr: "I don't see myself doing FP"  "I should look at ocaml"

00:37:03
samhuckaby: LUL

00:37:09
vapor__dev: @thdxr smh

00:37:09
thdxr: can never take anything this man says seriously

00:37:13
warrenbuffering: @thdxr LUL LUL LUL

00:38:02
techsavvytravvy: didn't love ocaml

00:38:14
mr_yan19: Has statmuse investigated some of the new vector db's like pinecone?

00:38:15
caiocodes: EduardoRFS is the only OCaml dev I've known in my whole life

00:38:16
thdxr: not just your tongue

00:38:24
laame: younso = "you do" if you squint really hard and I fat-finger on phone

00:38:32
oskrm: check posture

00:38:36
warrenbuffering: Did you get a flak from StatMuse for the Stripe tweet?

00:38:50
techsavvytravvy: oh great, working on experimental branch now so some cool new features

00:39:17
dumbe01: Hi chat and Adam! What would you say are good projects to get under my cv belt? Sry if it's a broad question.

00:39:26
caiocodes: how do you spell that streamer handle? I will check him out!

00:39:30
i_watch_qt_streamers: "After a 3 year hiatus, I'm back at StatMuse and enjoying the startup life once again!"  I saw this in your twitch bio. What does the hiatus mean?

00:39:32
techsavvytravvy: well that sounds exhausting

00:39:57
thdxr: why did you clarify that

00:39:59
thdxr: loooool

00:40:01
jenswoeste: on the whole functional vs oo debate. You can use F# (.NET version of Ocaml) and C# in same project. Just saying.

00:40:03
smilingbig: I wish people would tell me that KEKW

00:40:10
mr_yan19: vector db's might make for a good stream!

00:40:26
gitpush_gitpaid: is vercel doing a keynote today

00:40:34
neochromer: AMA Stream?

00:40:34
warrenbuffering: Midwest = Free speech

thdxr: yeah people from the ozarks say a lot of stuff they shouldn't say....

00:40:45
neochromer: Why do you hate Vercel? Kappa

00:40:53
gitpush_gitpaid: @thdxr that sounds like a threat

00:40:53
thdxr: adam wanna do watch party for the next vercel thing lmao

00:41:10
neochromer: @thdxr is it in an hour again?

00:41:29
techsavvytravvy: creative projects are good, deployed ideally

sockthedev: @thdxr please do

00:43:19
sockthedev: feel like thdxr is trying to make your relationship toxic

00:43:57
i_watch_qt_streamers: damn. why you got fired though. you shoulda fire him

00:44:18
techsavvytravvy: i'll make sure i provide sufficient context in every reply message

00:44:24
cosmiclasagna: @sockthedev wow and this time adam's the one who fired him from being a mod LUL

00:44:34
thdxr: adam stop saying you don't hate vercel

00:44:36
smilingbig: I wish people would tell me to not say things to people, I kind of just say what I think all the time

00:44:39
arbitrandomuser: everyone is trying to look like apple streams now

00:44:40
thdxr: let yourself express yourself for once

00:44:43

00:44:53
gitpush_gitpaid: vercels keynote today -> https://twitter.com/gitpush_gitpaid/status/1654503172696686593?

00:44:54
whatizit: what did they do which you didnt like?

00:45:05
iamtrulyao: I do not enjoy learning languages with their dominant frameworks and I have been learning Elixir lately and every course or article goes straight into Phoenix and there has been a lot of arguments on the web that learning and using Phoenix for things like smaller REST APIs is just the way to go, what do you think? Sorry this is so long -_<

00:45:10
sockthedev: how was that dude that went topless begging for a vercel job

00:45:14
smilingbig: KEKW

00:45:15
samhuckaby: Chat, which tech do we think Vercel will announce reselling today?

00:45:19
thdxr: @sockthedev my wife says I'm a little toxic

00:45:29
laame: If you could choose any language replace JavaScript in FE, what would you choose and why?

00:45:41
sockthedev: i used to think you were a nice guy dax. not sure anymore. sus.

00:46:28
gitpush_gitpaid: dont be down on yourself... you coulda probably went 4 years without killing the company

00:46:29
whatizit: what did you do for 3 years

00:46:44
thdxr: everyone is commenting on the topless thing meanwhile i stand in my front yard with just my boxers on and wave to people walking by

00:47:18
i_watch_qt_streamers: how many employees does statmuse have right now

00:47:44
whatizit: nah i was talking about vercel, sorry. what did vercel do that you didn't like?

00:48:06
sockthedev: i heard astro debugging is rough? whats your mileage been like here?

00:48:13
thdxr: and then your lsp doesn't work and then formatting doesn't work

00:48:22
thdxr: i love astro thoguh

00:48:25
iamtrulyao: Yup, Astro is great, tried it first time and never really looked back

00:49:21
adrnlnjnky: Phoenix is cool but  I don't use it for any project that I'm not building a UI.

00:50:00
warrenbuffering: @whatizit when things and ideas get too much hype someone has to play devil's advocate

00:50:05
i_watch_qt_streamers: yeah, i hate how phoenix generators creates billions of files. too much fragmentation imo. i wish there was a more minimalistic web framework in elixir

00:50:11
neochromer: @adamdotdev but how did you start consulting? Word of mouth or something like that? Did you have certs or a nice background?

00:50:15
thdxr: now you resent your son

00:50:21
warrenbuffering: *my thoughts not adam's

00:50:31
silverlp: Sadge

00:50:37
samhuckaby: @thdxr woah, easy Home

00:50:44
adrnlnjnky: @iamtrulyao I think folks use Phoenix for some conveniences but you can easily add the features you need without adding the entire framework to say an api-client with  no front end.

00:51:18
gohaku__: how fast is your wifi in the ozarks?

00:51:19
saint_pyotr: lmk if you'd like to make that 11 people B)

00:51:30
thdxr: every single day we hear adam lie about "I use vercel every day"

00:51:47
warrenbuffering: @whatizit well this aged like milk

00:51:58
thdxr: it's kinda interesting we both have the same feeling but there's more pressure on you to say you're not a vercel hater

00:52:02
thdxr: i literally never have to say that

00:52:05
typosrry: wen do we hear "I use SST every day"

00:52:09
whatizit: fair comments

00:52:20
i_watch_qt_streamers: what's the tech behind the ML part of statmuse?

00:53:03
iamtrulyao: @adrnlnJnky Ah yes yes, I tried that, I just kind of feel I should be able to get away with not using any framework like in Go for something trivial

00:54:04
adrnlnjnky: @iamtrulyao You can.  At work we use React for a front-end so we don't use any framework in our Elixir.  I use mix to create projects most of the time.

00:54:09
teej_dv: someone told me you've been talking about ocaml behind my back

00:54:12
warrenbuffering: my grandma asked me to build a website for the local Sons of Norway, but I don't have the time unfortunately. Will you build it?

00:55:21
mr_yan19: we have 2.5 gig and it is a bit silly for home use

00:55:37
samhuckaby: @teej_dv is still bitter about the Vercel stream..

00:55:43
teej_dv: it's impossible to have a convo w/ adam. he's like 25 minutes behind

00:56:00
thdxr: @teej_dv plz don't associate me with what happened yesterday

00:56:11
developmentrobot: I came here because I saw a thread on twitter that discussed the biggest vercel haters and someone linked your stream

00:56:12
thdxr: i was as much a victim as the audience

00:56:20
neochromer: Today you guys can do a re-do

00:56:22
teej_dv: @thdxr you could have left ANY TIME

00:56:29
laame: Well, every energy dring is like 200mg per serving

00:56:34
thdxr: but it was like watching a car accident in slow motion

00:56:35

00:56:39
