caldotjs: hello guys :>

10:27:22
stroopwafel26: ohai

10:27:32
caldotjs: how are you doing stroop?

10:27:46
andom: Hello!

10:28:25
stroopwafel26: @caldotjs great! thanks for asking, hbu

10:31:47
caldotjs: @caldotjs fiddling around with my thesis. damn I am happy when its over.. besides that, really good

10:32:12
stroopwafel26: @caldotjs what's your thesis about?

10:33:44
stroopwafel26: nice easter egg on the grey keyboard

10:34:07
caldotjs: @caldotjs Prediction of sea surface temperatures using physics aware neural networks

10:34:51
stroopwafel26: @caldotjs I'm definitely not smart enough for any of that but it does sound really interesting!

10:35:16
<transcript>: Good day to you all.

10:35:26
<transcript>: Did we just announced three times? Is we actually play three different animations? Or do we just announce three different animations.

10:35:26
<transcript>: that

10:35:30
<transcript>: That looked kind of bad. What was that about.

10:35:36
<transcript>: Good day, Caldat's. Here. Stroops here and down here.

10:35:47
<transcript>: Hello to you all. Good day. Good morning. Good afternoon. Well, I just need to know what it is in the Netherlands. So I can just basically say that every time because I think everyone's from the other ones, right.

10:35:47
<transcript>: okay

10:35:49
<transcript>: Okay. Not everyone.

10:35:55
markboots__: Good afternoon!

10:35:55
sirtimme: hello! syncrosWiggle

10:35:56
<transcript>: A thesis. We're talking about thesis. Thesei thesis.

10:36:02
<transcript>: Wait a minute. I guess I should ask you guys can hear me, right.

10:36:02
<transcript>: geez

10:36:04
<transcript>: Geez, can you hear me.

10:36:04
<transcript>: is that

10:36:05
<transcript>: Is that fixed.

10:36:07
laytanl_: Hello!

10:36:11
stroopwafel26: we can hear you

10:36:12
<transcript>: So, Timmy's, here. Mark is here. Good afternoon. Late in tear.

10:36:15
markboots__: where is the sound?

10:36:17
<transcript>: We can hear you. Oh, fantastic. That's all I needed.

10:36:20
<transcript>: Shut Up, Mark.

10:36:25
laytanl_: Afternoon in the NL

10:36:26
<transcript>: So.

10:36:26
<transcript>: i

10:36:27
<transcript>: I.

10:36:32
<transcript>: Afternoon. Okay. So I'm just gonna start saying good afternoon. You know what? That makes sense, too. Because.

10:36:36
<transcript>: It's like in the middle, right.

10:36:36
<transcript>: if it's in the middle

10:36:38
<transcript>: If it's in the middle, I feel like.

10:36:38
<transcript>: nobody gets

10:36:44
<transcript>: Nobody gets too offended. Fit your morning and I say, good afternoon. It's that offensive. I don't know.

10:36:44
<transcript>: if it

10:36:47
markboots__: G'day

10:36:50
stroopwafel26: g'day chaps

10:36:51
<transcript>: If it's your evening if you're in Australia and I say good afternoon, you're probably not too upset about it.

10:36:54
caldotjs: @caldotjs it's interesting but a bit iffy since I am comparing model performance on two different models that are really different. so getting some sort of "fair" comparison is iffy.. and gradients are vanishing etc...

10:36:58
devopstty: you like looking not on me but staring inside me with calm eyes I am scared))

10:36:59
<transcript>: Sorry I didn't just start streaming to, like text people on my phone, but I just occurred to me.

10:37:05
<transcript>: I didn't turn on a light. There's a light that's turned on from my phone, which is super annoying.

10:37:09
<transcript>: Good day, good day, good day.

10:37:13
<transcript>: So I did the manual labor yesterday. I tweeted about it.

10:37:14
laytanl_: 1/9/2022 btw

10:37:16
<transcript>: I'm exhausted.

10:37:16
<transcript>: i'm still tired

10:37:17
<transcript>: I'm still tired.

10:37:20
<transcript>: 1922.

10:37:24
<transcript>: I need somebody that'd be triggered by that.

10:37:27
<transcript>: Did I just turn up my fill light? I didn't mean to.

10:37:32
stroopwafel26: dd-mm-yyyy

10:37:32
<transcript>: Do.

10:37:36
sirtimme: ^

10:37:36
<transcript>: Accidentally turned up that I didn't mean to do that.

10:37:40
<transcript>: Okay, let's turn this one on.

10:37:47
<transcript>: All right. Now we're good. Now we're good. Day. Month. Year. I don't know about that.

10:37:47
<transcript>: i don't know

10:37:49
<transcript>: I don't know. Stroop.

10:37:49
<transcript>: makes

10:37:51
<transcript>: Makes sense to me that we do.

10:37:51
<transcript>: month day

10:37:56
<transcript>: Month day, year. Because that's what we do in America. And I'm used to it.

10:37:58
<transcript>: So that makes sense to me.

10:38:03
cedpoilly: hello all! hello @adamelmore

10:38:06
<transcript>: Yes, I I did like hard.

10:38:11
<transcript>: Hey, said Polly. I did hard manual labor. I'd like drag.

10:38:11
<transcript>: a silt

10:38:11
aivars_meijers: Hi all!

10:38:12
<transcript>: A silt.

10:38:18
<transcript>: Are they called Sulfide? In Europe? I don't know. It's like an irrigation control thing.

10:38:22
<transcript>: Avers. Is here. Avers.

10:38:23
stroopwafel26: mm-dd-yyyy only makes sense in murica MaxLOL

10:38:27
<transcript>: averse a year

10:38:27
<transcript>: averse a year only makes

10:38:30
<transcript>: Averse a year only makes sense in America.

10:38:36
<transcript>: Yeah. It's the one thing that I've gotten used to as an American that I won't budge on.

10:38:36
<transcript>: i realized

10:38:41
<transcript>: I realized the American Standard, whatever measurement system is super dumb.

10:38:43
<transcript>: Using.

10:38:43
<transcript>: fahrenheit

10:38:46
<transcript>: Fahrenheit instead of Celsius also super dumb.

10:38:50
aivars_meijers: MM DD YY is even more fun

10:38:53
stroopwafel26: let's measure things in football fields! great idea

10:38:53
<transcript>: Driving on the side that we drive on. I think we share that in common with a lot of people. I think it's just the Brits that are backward. Maybe Japanese. I'm not sure.

10:38:57
caldotjs: A poll about how many people in here are actually from Europe would be interesting. & we could finally decide on dd/mm/yy

10:38:59
<transcript>: Let's measure things in football fields.

10:39:10
<transcript>: That's a good call. That so visit Europe. Is that what we want to figure out.

10:39:11
<transcript>: Are you in your.

10:39:11
<transcript>: specific

10:39:14
<transcript>: Specifically? Or is there anything.

10:39:16
<transcript>: New opposite.

10:39:17
<transcript>: Are.

10:39:17
<transcript>: you

10:39:19
<transcript>: You in your.

10:39:19
<transcript>: i'm not gonna

10:39:20
sirtimme: @stroopwafel26 and washing machines

10:39:25
<transcript>: I'm not gonna say, Are you from Europe? I'm not gonna say, do you live it? I'm just gonna say, Are you in Europe? So right now.

10:39:25
<transcript>: are you in

10:39:29
<transcript>: Are you in Europe? Yes or no.

10:39:35
<transcript>: Okay.

10:39:45
cedpoilly: mm-dd-yyyy is nice for display - horrible for development though ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

10:39:45
<transcript>: I said that a little flavor.

10:39:45
<transcript>: one minute

10:39:47
<transcript>: 1 minute poll started now.

10:39:55
<transcript>: What about washing machines.

10:39:57
markboots__: probably not interesting for the most in here. But Chrome 105 launched with :has() pseudo selectors and container queries. CSS is awesome! Im totaly in my element right now

10:39:59
<transcript>: Nice for display horrible for development though.

10:40:08
<transcript>: Probably not interesting for the most in here, but Chrome. Well, five launched with hasseudo selectors in container queries oh, container queries.

10:40:08
<transcript>: that i'm excited

10:40:10
<transcript>: That I'm excited about.

10:40:12
stroopwafel26: also, I don't think we have many silt fences in NL, but in other European countries they do use them, NL is just better at water management, we have different solutions :P

10:40:18
<transcript>: Totally in your element right now, Mark. Right. Since CSS isn't our job awesome. It's so much better than manual labor. So just.

10:40:22
<transcript>: Tldr don't do manually labor. It's hard.

10:40:22
<transcript>: i don't

10:40:24
<transcript>: I don't recommend it.

10:40:31
<transcript>: Feel like I'm gonna be recovering for like two days. We don't have many silk fences in Netherlands, but in European kind.

10:40:32
<transcript>: kinds

10:40:32
<transcript>: kinds is just better at

10:40:36
<transcript>: Kinds is just better at water management. We have different solutions. Oh really.

10:40:36
laytanl_: Shouldn't we wait for those features to be added to firefox etc.?

10:40:39
<transcript>: Just you're above silk fences over there.

10:40:39
<transcript>: shouldn't we

10:40:47
<transcript>: Shouldn't we wait for those features to be added to Firefox, etc. Yeah, I don't know how soon can we use let's just check this will be first thing we do today.

10:40:50
<transcript>: A data.

10:40:55
<transcript>: 25 well, eight out of the people who said yet 80%.

10:40:55
<transcript>: of the people

10:40:58
<transcript>: Of the people who responded are in Europe.

10:40:58
<transcript>: i didn't

10:41:08
caldotjs: Isn't NL the most farming efficient country?

10:41:09
<transcript>: I didn't respond. I should responded. That was skewed. It a little bit, but only ten of you responded so 15 of you can't be bothered to answer the poll or you didn't know it existed.

10:41:11
stroopwafel26: where there is water we build land, where there is land we bring water, basically

10:41:11
<transcript>: Let's.

10:41:11
andom: why didnt i get a poll :(

10:41:14
<transcript>: Know in the most farming efficient country.

10:41:18
<transcript>: Where there is water. We build land, where there is land, we bring water, basically.

10:41:18
<transcript>: oh

10:41:21
aivars_meijers: I been a bartender, carpenter and in army before, typing words to be paid for sure is easier

10:41:24
markboots__: ohw, i didnt respond +1

10:41:24
<transcript>: Oh, you didn't get a pole, am I'm sorry? I don't know what causes. I don't know what the rhyme or reason is.

10:41:24
<transcript>: on

10:41:26
<transcript>: On pole.

10:41:31
cedpoilly: I had a coaching client asking me for help about container queries. I advised not to implement any production code. But if it is being shipped now, then ü§î

10:41:32
<transcript>: Okay. So we had a few people didn't respond. They probably didn't even know it was there.

10:41:40
<transcript>: Container queries I vice not to implement any production code, but if it is being shipped now then.

10:41:42
stroopwafel26: according to the poll about 80% of people don't get dates right

10:41:44
<transcript>: We're gonna look at it and we're gonna make the topic.

10:41:47
<transcript>: Topic.

10:41:52
<transcript>: Container queries.

10:41:55
adamelmore: !topic checking out container queries

10:41:56
<transcript>: Yeah.

10:41:58
<transcript>: Okay.

10:41:58
<transcript>: over here

10:42:00
<transcript>: Over here.

10:42:07
<transcript>: So let's do some Googling.

10:42:07
<transcript>: let's

10:42:14
stroopwafel26: !topic fix the announcements

10:42:14
laytanl_: 5 times now lol

10:42:15
<transcript>: Let's Google did it announce like three people? What is it doing? Why is it four people at five people this time? Okay. Something's very broken.

10:42:20
<transcript>: Very broken.

10:42:24
<transcript>: We should really fix this. That's a good topic.

10:42:27
<transcript>: First. I guess I said I was gonna do this.

10:42:27
<transcript>: can i

10:42:29
markboots__: @cedpoilly wait for it. Edge still has to implement it (somewhere this week) and firefox has no date yet

10:42:32
<transcript>: Can I use container queries? Let's see here.

10:42:34
<transcript>: Added Chrome has shipped.

10:42:37
<transcript>: Doesn't look great.

10:42:39
<transcript>: Doesn't look great. Mark.

10:42:48
<transcript>: Let's see Chrome 105 combining size, container, queries and table layout inside a Multicon layout doesn't work.

10:42:49
sandro_vol: Moin Adam üëã

10:42:51
<transcript>: Okay.

10:42:54
<transcript>: So we're at about plug 1%.

10:42:54
<transcript>: of users

10:42:57
stroopwafel26: Bark Moots at the cutting edge of technology again

10:42:57
<transcript>: Of users have.

10:43:00
<transcript>: Container, queries Mark.

10:43:00
<transcript>: i don't know if that's

10:43:04
<transcript>: I don't know if that's good enough for your use case. Then maybe you can go for it.

10:43:10
<transcript>: Edge still has to implement it sometimes somewhere this week. Oh, Firefox never has a date, do they.

10:43:10
<transcript>: i don't think

10:43:12
<transcript>: I don't think they ever have a date.

10:43:12
<transcript>: bark

10:43:16
<transcript>: Bark moods that the cutting edge of technology again.

10:43:18
<transcript>: Good Morning. Sandra.

10:43:23
<transcript>: Let's fix the announcement thing. I wasn't gonna work on the.

10:43:23
<transcript>: hey

10:43:26
<transcript>: Hey, percent of people don't get dates, right? That's right.

10:43:43
<transcript>: I wasn't going to work on the overlays today, but we probably should fix the thing that's very broken. We are going to work on my Neil, them config a little bit. I want to catch up a little bit on that because I've been kind of putting stuff off. So specifically.

10:43:47
<transcript>: Text objects so.

10:43:47
<transcript>: i'm gonna add

10:43:48
<transcript>: I'm gonna add.

10:43:57
cedpoilly: @markboots__ yes let's wait for Firefox. I think that Chrome & Firefox are the ones to wait for. At least to have in a dev branch üåø

10:44:00
<transcript>: Is it LSP. Text objects. What is it? I don't remember. There's a text object pub plugin that I want to play with. I want to actually learn surround, like figure out what's going on there.

10:44:06
<transcript>: What else? There's a few things, other things in Miami, of Mcompig. Maybe we'll make it to do.

10:44:06
<transcript>: maybe we'll make

10:44:08
<transcript>: Maybe we'll make it to dot.

10:44:08
<transcript>: m

10:44:11
<transcript>: Md just maybe.

10:44:17
laytanl_: treesitter textobjects I guess

10:44:17
<transcript>: Mark down. Lsp. I don't know if I have markdown. Lsp. We might add that.

10:44:18
stroopwafel26: of course edge will fix it soon, it's chromium as well

10:44:22
<transcript>: Now I was gonna work on public. Actually. Public Dev. Time to get serious.

10:44:24
<transcript>: Get that thing.

10:44:24
<transcript>: sh

10:44:26
sandro_vol: Everytime I join the stream there is a new programming language or huge thing that changed :D  Now it is LUA üòÑ

10:44:31
<transcript>: Shipped. I mean, I just got to shift the we did all the redesign work early in my streaming career.

10:44:31
<transcript>: a month

10:44:33
<transcript>: A month ago.

10:44:33
<transcript>: we did all that

10:44:36
<transcript>: We did all that redesign stuff. And then I just.

10:44:36
<transcript>: i just

10:44:40
<transcript>: I just paused, and I built a bunch of Twitch overlays.

10:44:40
<transcript>: but we never

10:44:44
markboots__: yea, they are not really synced. Other way around FF has sub grid, while chrome has no date. Hope end of this year we can use all to the fullest

10:44:45
<transcript>: But we never shipped the redesign, so we were, like, really close to done with it, and I want to finish it.

10:44:48
<transcript>: You know what is out.

10:44:48
<transcript>: mark

10:44:50
<transcript>: Mark talking about releases.

10:44:54
<transcript>: What is out is, Why am I wearing glasses.

10:44:54
cedpoilly: @adamelmore I'd be happy to be in the early testing team for public.dev

10:44:57
<transcript>: What is that is OBS 28, officially.

10:44:57
<transcript>: it's no longer

10:45:00
<transcript>: It's no longer in Beta. It is public.

10:45:00
<transcript>: so while

10:45:07
stroopwafel26: OBS 28!!!!11

10:45:07
<transcript>: So while we're in the overlays, okay, okay, fine. Talk to me into it. We're gonna go into the overlays. We're gonna actually.

10:45:07
<transcript>: create a branch

10:45:11
<transcript>: Create a branch for OBS.

10:45:25
<transcript>: Webs WebSocket version five because we're gonna have to all the stuff I did with the WebSocket stuff in OBS is version four of the plugin, but on OBS 28, I need to be using version five because it's baked in.

10:45:28
<transcript>: Okay. So why.

10:45:28
<transcript>: why

10:45:29
<transcript>: Why.

10:45:29
<transcript>: is it

10:45:32
<transcript>: Is it broken? What happened.

10:45:34
aivars_meijers: Sadly not all the plugins supports OBS 23 for M!

10:45:35
<transcript>: Let's go over here.

10:45:38
<transcript>: Anything obvious.

10:45:38
<transcript>: shared

10:45:40
<transcript>: Shared that's where.

10:45:43
<transcript>: Now, where do we do that.

10:45:47
<transcript>: Let's see, where do we give attributes.

10:45:50
<transcript>: That's in the Stinger thing.

10:45:54
aivars_meijers: oh, so many typos. I'm a champ

10:45:56
<transcript>: Finger lip Stinger. Here.

10:45:57
stroopwafel26: I've been throwing 4k video through OBS in the latest M1 optimized version and performance is pretty awesome

10:46:00
<transcript>: Let's get some keycaster going.

10:46:00
<transcript>: oh

10:46:02
<transcript>: Oh, I didn't do it.

10:46:05
<transcript>: Keycasters aren't running.

10:46:05
<transcript>: keycast

10:46:07
<transcript>: Keycaster.

10:46:09
<transcript>: I really need like.

10:46:09
<transcript>: i don't know

10:46:13
<transcript>: I don't know. Some kind of like Startup script. It does everything.

10:46:13
<transcript>: there's

10:46:16
<transcript>: There's, my Jays. Gonna move them up here.

10:46:20
<transcript>: There's just so many little steps to get a stream started, you know.

10:46:21
aivars_meijers: @stroopwafel26 ok, installing it to try out later today

10:46:26
<transcript>: Where do we give attribution? So we got the author.

10:46:28
<transcript>: We are clue.

10:46:30
<transcript>: You should share.

10:46:33
<transcript>: Here we go.

10:46:42
<transcript>: Put it author here onto this I know what's going.

10:46:45
<transcript>: Think I know it's got.

10:46:48
<transcript>: Transitioned.

10:46:53
<transcript>: I changed this right before I started the stream because it was yelling at me.

10:46:57
<transcript>: But I shouldn't have.

10:46:59
<transcript>: Should not have.

10:47:02
<transcript>: Okay. So.

10:47:02
<transcript>: now

10:47:03
<transcript>: Now.

10:47:03
<transcript>: on

10:47:06
<transcript>: On transitioned.

10:47:07
<transcript>: Let's see.

10:47:07
<transcript>: if

10:47:09
<transcript>: If.

10:47:16
<transcript>: That's the issue. It's not changed.

10:47:16
<transcript>: it's remotely

10:47:18
<transcript>: It's remotely similar to that.

10:47:18
<transcript>: let's disable

10:47:20
<transcript>: Let's disable it for this line.

10:47:23
<transcript>: And let's try it again.

00:23:34
<transcript>: but

00:23:34
<transcript>: Sadly, not all the plugins support OBS 28. Yeah, that's true.

00:23:37
<transcript>: But I looked at the List, the matrix.

00:23:37
<transcript>: of

00:23:43
<transcript>: Of support for 28 and one of the things I use don't have support.

00:23:49
<transcript>: Which is to say, I don't use Rema plugins.

00:23:52
<transcript>: And I don't need to wait on these.

00:24:00
<transcript>: Every time I join the stream, there's a new programming language, a huge thing that changed.

00:24:08
<transcript>: Sandra. Yeah, we're doing hottree sitters. Thank you. Late. And tree sitter. Texts, objects. I guess that's exactly right.

00:24:12
caldotjs: wanted to ask since a few streams: you are using iterm2 right? since you are nvimming now quite a bit, doesn't the performance annoy you?

00:24:16
<transcript>: so we've been working

00:24:16
<transcript>: Yeah. We've been working on my neovem config Sandro. I switched over to neovim on the stream a couple weeks ago. A few weeks ago.

00:24:20
<transcript>: So we've been working on that. That's where the Louis comes from.

00:24:26
<transcript>: Yeah. Fraser. Support is hard.

00:24:31
adamelmore: !betakey

00:24:31
fossabot: Use beta key `adamisontwitch2` after signing up at public.dev.

00:24:31
<transcript>: I'd be happy to be in the early testing team for public debt Poly. Well, you know what.

00:24:34
<transcript>: You can do there's a beta key for you.

00:24:40
<transcript>: I've been throwing 4K videos.

00:24:40
<transcript>: and the latest

00:24:43
<transcript>: And the latest in one optimized version.

00:24:49
<transcript>: And performance is pretty awesome. That is good to hear. I don't know if I can do 4K.

00:24:49
<transcript>: because

00:24:54
<transcript>: Because my capture card. Well, I could do 4K, but I have to do 30 frames.

00:24:54
<transcript>: i can't

00:25:02
<transcript>: I can't do these capture cards. They can't do four K sixty. So I'm choosing to do one thousand and eighty P sixty.

00:25:02
<transcript>: all my

00:25:03
cedpoilly: thanks a lot man! ü•≥

00:25:06
<transcript>: All my cameras are 4K. So I suppose I could go four K thirty.

00:25:22
sandro_vol: https://public.dev/sandro üòé

00:25:24
<transcript>: I wanted to ask. Since a few streams you were using, I turned two, right? Yeah, I am. Since you are in Dimming now quite a bit. Doesn't the performance annoy you? It really does. I don't think I noticed. It might just be my Mac studio is beefy, but I don't notic any eye term slowness.

00:25:24
<transcript>: i

00:25:29
<transcript>: I've heard Kitty is so fast uses the GPU and all that.

00:25:29
<transcript>: i download

00:25:30
stroopwafel26: yeah I do 4k30 through my sony rx100 straight connected to my mac using USB

00:25:31
<transcript>: I downloaded Kitty.

00:25:31
<transcript>: and

00:25:34
<transcript>: And there's Sandra's Public ID.

00:25:34
<transcript>: i

00:25:50
<transcript>: I have noticed the speed difference, but I didn't play with Kitty very much and I'd thought about going to Alacrity, it sounds more in line with my values which are minimal, just like I don't want. I don't think I'm using even much of the features of eye term.

00:25:50
<transcript>: and

00:25:50
caldotjs: did you try other stuff? since I definitely notice when going back and forth

00:25:52
sandro_vol: I gave warp a try for 1-2 months and I really can't change terminal anymore :D

00:25:55
<transcript>: And I would just use the builtin terminal to try and be as simple as possible, but.

00:25:55
<transcript>: doesn't support

00:25:58
<transcript>: Doesn't support colors, and I can't handle that.

00:26:01
<transcript>: What are we doing here.

00:26:01
<transcript>: so

00:26:03
<transcript>: So we want to try transition.

00:26:03
<transcript>: and see

00:26:08
<transcript>: And see Stroop you do four K thirty through your Sony RX 100.

00:26:08
<transcript>: straight next

00:26:23
laytanl_: I use Iterm as well and never had any noticeable slowdowns or issues

00:26:23
<transcript>: Straight next to my Mac using OBS using USB. Oh, you've played in through USB. Interesting. I think these Sony cameras that I'm using you can plug in straight through USB, but I didn't know if the quality was as good as HDMI or performance or whatever.

00:26:26
caldotjs: alacritty is also faster :) & the maintainer isn't that weird :D

00:26:29
<transcript>: You gave Warp a try for one to two months and I really can't change terminal anymore.

00:26:36
<transcript>: Definitely notice when going back and forth. Yeah. I guess I didn't try. I want to try a lackerdie. Maybe we'll do that today on stream.

00:26:36
<transcript>: caldat

00:26:37
<transcript>: Caldat.

00:26:37
<transcript>: it like me

00:26:44
<transcript>: It like me uses eye term as well never had any notes and slowdowns or issues. Maybe I just don't know what I don't know. Maybe I haven't experienced.

00:26:44
<transcript>: speed

00:26:44
stroopwafel26: yeah my rx100 also has mini HDMI or whatever it's called but USB is fine

00:26:45
<transcript>: lac

00:26:45
<transcript>: Speed yet.

00:26:50
<transcript>: the kitty main

00:26:50
<transcript>: Lacropy is also faster than maintainer. Isn't that I've heard some things about.

00:26:52
<transcript>: The Kitty maintainer.

00:27:04
<transcript>: Okay, thanks for the follow of workwind. Why didn't I get notifications? That's because this is broken. What is this? Why is it broken? What is going on? Why is everything broken.

00:27:06
<transcript>: Topic.

00:27:10
<transcript>: I guess.

00:27:13
<transcript>: That's not word guess.

00:27:13
<transcript>: we'll fix

00:27:17
adamelmore: !topic i GUESS we'll fix the overlays

00:27:18
<transcript>: We'll fix the wow. I can't type six the overlays.

00:27:20
<transcript>: I guess.

00:27:22
<transcript>: What is this.

00:27:22
<transcript>: invalid

00:27:24
<transcript>: Invalid time value.

00:27:24
<transcript>: time

00:27:25
<transcript>: Timer duplicate.

00:27:31
<transcript>: Time.

00:27:32
<transcript>: Okay.

00:27:32
<transcript>: let's

00:27:37
<transcript>: Let's fix that. And then let's see if our.

00:27:39
<transcript>: For Things, working.

00:27:42
<transcript>: Here we are overlays. We're back.

00:27:45
<transcript>: Can't get away.

00:27:52
stroopwafel26: @caldotjs I've been trying out Adam's nvim config yesterday and performance in kitty was... not great. Everything slowed down when I'm in a huge codebase and I have nvimtree open. Gotta figure that out.

00:27:53
<transcript>: Did I do? What did I do.

00:28:03
<transcript>: Try out Adams in Zim Kuzzu yesterday performance, and Kitty was not great. Everything slowed down and I'm a huge and a huge code base. And I had.

00:28:03
<transcript>: inventri

00:28:05
<transcript>: Inventrie open interesting.

00:28:05
<transcript>: so

00:28:08
<transcript>: So we're gonna open index.

00:28:08
<transcript>: next

00:28:09
<transcript>: Next.

00:28:09
<transcript>: page

00:28:11
<transcript>: Page like that.

00:28:14
<transcript>: Where was the issue.

00:28:14
<transcript>: it was

00:28:16
<transcript>: now the time

00:28:16
<transcript>: It was.

00:28:19
<transcript>: Now the time value Set timer.

00:28:33
<transcript>: Okay, so timer two isostring widespread. Why is there a timer on this page right now? There shouldn't be a timer. This is the homepage. Oh, yeah, yeah, there is a timer. It's this thing. The corner is not working. Okay.

00:28:33
<transcript>: oh

00:28:39
<transcript>: Oh, because we now we have this U stream. I changed things. This is now looks different.

00:28:39
<transcript>: i bet

00:28:42
<transcript>: I bet I didn't. Yeah. Use stream response.

00:28:42
<transcript>: that's such a mistake

00:28:43
caldotjs: @caldotjs are u using tmux?

00:28:44
<transcript>: That's such a mistake.

00:28:52
<transcript>: Go here. Hey, I got that. Thanks for the follow. Sam. I did hear that. So we saw a notification, I guess.

00:28:52
<transcript>: that feels

00:29:05
<transcript>: That feels good. Okay. Everything's not everything entirely broken? Everything is not entirely broken. Feels like a Monday. Anybody think it feels like a Monday when you take off Wednesdays.

00:29:05
<transcript>: And then 30.

00:29:07
<transcript>: Mark.

00:29:07
<transcript>: thank you so much

00:29:09
<transcript>: Thank you so much.

00:29:09
<transcript>: gift

00:29:10
stroopwafel26: @laytanl_ 80 stars on the cloack repo! congrats :)

00:29:12
<transcript>: Gifting out subs. I appreciate that.

00:29:17
<transcript>: Yeah, 80 Stars on the cloak. Repo. Leighton, how cool.

00:29:19
<transcript>: How cool.

00:29:26
<transcript>: Thank you so much, Mark. I appreciate that. Were you just trying to upload the spirits here before things got Graham again.

00:29:28
markboots__: testing

00:29:31
<transcript>: Use stream response. What are you.

00:29:34
markboots__: LuL

00:29:36
<transcript>: So we're trying to set a client stream to date.

00:29:36
<transcript>: those are

00:29:41
<transcript>: Those are no longer dates. They are strings. So what if we said.

00:29:43
stroopwafel26: @caldotjs yeah in tmux, but outside of tmux it's the same

00:29:46
<transcript>: All of this is garbage. What if we did that? What if we said.

00:29:46
<transcript>: let's

00:29:48
<transcript>: Let's all straight garbage.

00:29:48
<transcript>: and

00:29:53
<transcript>: it

00:29:53
<transcript>: And we don't use this is not what it returns anymore.

00:29:54
<transcript>: It returns.

00:29:54
<transcript>: a get

00:29:56
laytanl_: Yeah, cloak blew up thanks to Adam

00:29:56
<transcript>: a get stream response you know what i'm saying

00:29:59
<transcript>: A get stream response. You know what I'm saying? Just think.

00:30:02
<transcript>: And then we don't need this anymore.

00:30:04
<transcript>: And then.

00:30:04
<transcript>: let's go

00:30:10
<transcript>: so

00:30:10
<transcript>: Let's go back here. Now. What do we got? Is it working? No.

00:30:12
<transcript>: So timer use stream.

00:30:12
laytanl_: Such a simple plugin as well

00:30:15
<transcript>: Now stream is a get stream response.

00:30:15
<transcript>: time

00:30:17
matty_twoshoes: lurkin while workin mattyt25LurkSlide

00:30:19
<transcript>: Timer let's see actual start.

00:30:19
<transcript>: is

00:30:22
<transcript>: Is that which is a string.

00:30:27
<transcript>: And we can pass that string into a date. No, we can't.

00:30:29
<transcript>: ooh

00:30:29
<transcript>: Interesting.

00:30:32
<transcript>: Ooh, this is a problem? I gotta fix this.

00:30:36
<transcript>: This is definitely a problem. I know the problem.

00:30:36
<transcript>: know it

00:30:39
laytanl_: Even ThePrimeagen tweeted about it

00:30:41
<transcript>: this is

00:30:41
<transcript>: Know it know that it's a problem I just I'm I gotta check this real quick.

00:30:45
<transcript>: This is New Nine One. We'll see. Do we have transcripts.

00:30:45
<transcript>: we do

00:30:46
<transcript>: We do.

00:30:52
aivars_meijers: Seems that stream deck support is broken after update to OBS 28, but otherwise I'm good

00:30:59
<transcript>: All did. We just announced three times, and it looked kind of bad. Well, that about look at this. Everyone look at this transcripts with the chat. I finished it. I just did it offstream because I was so frustrated that day.

00:31:06
<transcript>: Okay. We're getting stuff. We're getting transcripts. And they are mixed in.

00:31:09
<transcript>: Well, that's not ideal.

00:31:09
<transcript>: it's

00:31:13
<transcript>: It's it's putting in some partial transcripts. That's not great.

00:31:17
<transcript>: But you know, we can fix that. That's fixable.

00:31:21
<transcript>: Okay.

00:31:28
<transcript>: Reading my incoherent transcripts. That's a good time.

00:31:35
<transcript>: Look, I mean, they're in here, right? If I'm like if later. I'm like, let's get out of this file.

00:31:38
<transcript>: Let's go back here on that piece.

00:31:38
<transcript>: what is

00:31:40
<transcript>: What is it? Control.

00:31:42
<transcript>: Cisco somewhere else.

00:31:42
<transcript>: so

00:32:03
<transcript>: So if later, I say, oh, what was that? I was talking about manual labor or something. Then I can be like, oh, look, let's do a live grab manual labor. There it is, in the transcript. I can find it in the VOD, just like that. And that's why we built that feature. We push through, just like, I push through that manual labor yesterday. We made it happen.

00:32:03
<transcript>: it was

00:32:04
markboots__: codingClap Well done!

00:32:07
<transcript>: It was hard. Sometimes you gotta do hard work. Okay, I'm gonna stop.

00:32:10
<transcript>: Okay. So we need to actually return.

00:32:12
sirtimme: syncrosHype

00:32:18
<transcript>: Let's actually return a date because now I'm returning the formatted date. Thought I'd just do that on the back end.

00:32:22
<transcript>: That was a mistake. A bit of a mistake.

00:32:25
<transcript>: So let's go to.

00:32:25
<transcript>: stream

00:32:28
<transcript>: Stream, but we want the API variety.

00:32:28
<transcript>: now this is

00:32:31
<transcript>: Now this is what we want. Get stream.

00:32:34
<transcript>: Here.

00:32:34
<transcript>: so

00:32:39
<transcript>: So here I'm just returning these formatted dates now.

00:32:44
caldotjs: @Mods am I allowed to link a screenshot of iterm performance on my system?

00:32:46
<transcript>: What we really want.

00:32:46
stroopwafel26: look at this guy flying through vim

00:32:49
<transcript>: We want an ISO date.

00:32:56
<transcript>: We want an ISO date, and then we'll format it on the front end, right.

00:32:58
<transcript>: i think that's what we

00:32:58
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:33:00
<transcript>: I think that's what we want.

00:33:00
<transcript>: look at me

00:33:06
<transcript>: Look at me. Flying through them. Am I flying? Am I doing that? Not flying through them.

00:33:06
<transcript>: seems

00:33:09
<transcript>: Seems that stream export is broken after update to open.

00:33:10
<transcript>: opens i think

00:33:10
<transcript>: opens i think you have to update

00:33:20
<transcript>: Opens I think you have to update your Stream Deck plugin because they did just announce like in the last few days. They added support for version 28 in the Stream Diet plugin, but you might not have the latest.

00:33:20
<transcript>: yeah

00:33:25
<transcript>: Yeah, lighten Prime Twitter about or tweeted about cloak twoTED about cloak.

00:33:36
stroopwafel26: twotter

00:33:37
<transcript>: Just catching up on Chat, lurking while working. Hey, Maddie, two shoes.

00:33:42
<transcript>: We credited you like six times earlier because there's a bug.

00:33:47
<transcript>: Are you allowed to link a screenshot? Yes, of course.

00:33:50
<transcript>: Of course twater.

00:33:54
<transcript>: It's not what Twitter is. It's Twitter, not Twitter.

00:33:57
caldotjs: https://twitter.com/caldotdev/status/1565292489229074432?s=20&t=Z3ZcE8ODNe6lC0w-aTWiXw

00:33:59
<transcript>: to watch this

00:33:59
<transcript>: I'm mistake. Okay, let's see if I can just like delete.

00:34:06
<transcript>: To watch this? Just watch this. I'm not even deleted I'm gonna see whatever C stands for? I'm gonna go see.

00:34:08
<transcript>: Nope. Can't do that.

00:34:15
<transcript>: Do that. What about Delete? Nope. If it's on a same line, I guess you can't delete.

00:34:17
<transcript>: Like if I want to yank.

00:34:17
<transcript>: yank

00:34:23
<transcript>: Yankoo. No, we can't go to that open friends at the bottom. There can't do that.

00:34:30
<transcript>: Like I want to. I mean, I can just do this.

00:34:33
<transcript>: And delete it.

00:34:33
<transcript>: so

00:34:35
buffetcodes: Hi! :D

00:34:37
<transcript>: So schedule start to ISO string.

00:34:37
<transcript>: i even need

00:34:39
<transcript>: I even need to do this.

00:34:42
<transcript>: Think so.

00:34:44
buffetcodes: How are you doing?

00:34:46
<transcript>: I'm gonna copy like I will have it copied.

00:34:49
stroopwafel26: @caldotjs kitty is performing pretty well in your tests

00:34:55
<transcript>: Two oh, Oops.

00:34:57
<transcript>: Two ISO string.

00:35:19
<transcript>: Okay. So I'm ISO formatting those. I don't know if I needed to do that because I think I'm already having to jump through some Hoops to date serialize stuff.

00:35:29
<transcript>: To JSON serialize. Okay, we're fine, though. We're gonna do this. So these are gonna come out as ISO strings instead of date whatever they are.

00:35:35
<transcript>: So there's still strings. But now we need to go in and change something.

00:35:36
<transcript>: In intro.

00:35:40
<transcript>: Here. We need to format this.

00:35:44
<transcript>: Because we have like a date utility or something.

00:35:45
<transcript>: Lib.

00:35:49
<transcript>: Pills just put.

00:35:49
<transcript>: let's do this

00:35:52
<transcript>: Let's do this right here. Export format.

00:35:52
<transcript>: date

00:35:53
<transcript>: Date.

00:35:57
<transcript>: Equals date.

00:36:00
<transcript>: Or string.

00:36:01
avarice: your keyboard is so hot

00:36:02
caldotjs: @caldotjs yes its doing fine. + the window feature is a pro, since you don't need tmux if you use it. Using tmux hits performance quite hard as you can see in the other screenshot in the thread

00:36:03
<transcript>: Even better.

00:36:05
<transcript>: Turn date.

00:36:12
avarice: !keyboard

00:36:12
fossabot: Adam uses a custom Mode Eighty mechanical keyboard, and has a collection of other Mode keyboards!

00:36:14
<transcript>: So if type of is it like this type of date equals string.

00:36:22
<transcript>: Then new date thanks for the follow somebody thanks for the follow Amy I'm a Yee lost.

00:36:24
<transcript>: Average.

00:36:24
<transcript>: that's my key

00:36:28
<transcript>: That's my keyboard. You're verified what's that mean? Again, that means you're on Twitch alone.

00:36:28
<transcript>: or

00:36:33
<transcript>: Or your strength. Maybe do you straight.

00:36:38
<transcript>: How do I learn something about you.

00:36:39
avarice: i used to stream kiriahHeadPat

00:36:45
<transcript>: There's a like a millipede pronunner into my office. Hey, thanks for the followaborice.

00:36:51
<transcript>: You used to stream I see so now you're you're verified.

00:37:01
<transcript>: My keyboard is so hot. Thanks. Hey, you want to see my keyboard? Check this out. We've got a view for that. Oh Geez, everything's so broken sorry that my overalles are broken. Thanks for following anyway.

00:37:06
<transcript>: Yeah, you can see my keyboard now. There it is. Mode 80.

00:37:09
avarice: oh mama

00:37:13
<transcript>: This is nice with the air on top. I feel like this is an improvement. Maybe.

00:37:13
avarice: clean setup brother

00:37:19
<transcript>: It's nice that it's not actually killing my hole overlay, right? It's just killing the timer. So that's cool.

00:37:19
<transcript>: like we just don't have

00:37:21
buffetcodes: Yeah, seriously clean setup

00:37:21
<transcript>: Like we just don't have a timer.

00:37:21
<transcript>: now i'm

00:37:24
<transcript>: Now I'm should be able to fix this really easy.

00:37:25
buffetcodes: Just use Linux :(

00:37:27
<transcript>: Thanks everice. I appreciate that.

00:37:33
<transcript>: Back here. So now we're doing this format date thing.

00:37:39
<transcript>: And then we're gonna say.

00:37:40
stroopwafel26: @caldotjs but I like using tmux :(

00:37:44
<transcript>: Else. No. Okay. So not return. It's not return.

00:37:44
<transcript>: i'm nervous here

00:37:47
<transcript>: I'm nervous here because I have something in my clipboard.

00:37:50
<transcript>: So let's paste that so I can.

00:37:53
<transcript>: Not be so nervous.

00:37:53
<transcript>: so this

00:37:56
<transcript>: So this is gonna instead be like.

00:37:56
<transcript>: hot

00:37:57
<transcript>: value

00:37:57
<transcript>: Hot.

00:37:59
<transcript>: Value equals.

00:38:02
<transcript>: otherwise

00:38:02
<transcript>: And then we're gonna say.

00:38:06
<transcript>: Otherwise, it's just date. So if it's not a string, it's a date, right.

00:38:08
<transcript>: Right.

00:38:11
<transcript>: Think so.

00:38:11
<transcript>: so

00:38:13
<transcript>: this

00:38:13
<transcript>: So.

00:38:16
<transcript>: This thing right here is what date? Correct.

00:38:16
<transcript>: okay so

00:38:19
<transcript>: dot

00:38:19
<transcript>: Okay. So now return value.

00:38:21
<transcript>: Dot.

00:38:21
<transcript>: to

00:38:23
<transcript>: To it's this whole thing.

00:38:39
<transcript>: If I want to paste on the next character.

00:38:39
<transcript>: id

00:38:41
<transcript>: Id. That.

00:38:46
<transcript>: somebody tell me like i could just do that but i feel like there's got to be like a shortcut for that and then

00:38:47
<transcript>: Somebody tell me like I could just do that. But I feel like there's got to be, like, a shortcut for that. And then.

00:38:47
<transcript>: i've

00:38:51
<transcript>: I've learned anything about them. There's a shortcut for everything.

00:38:54
caldotjs: @caldotjs yeah I mean using alacritty with tmux is still lightyears ahead iterm and only slightly worse than alacritty in some tests. I have both set up and use them depending on my mood :D

00:39:00
<transcript>: Okay, so format date we're gonna use this all over the place shortly. First, let's go to our index.

00:39:04
<transcript>: This is very broken. And I'm tired of the air on the screen.

00:39:04
<transcript>: so

00:39:09
<transcript>: So start actual start. These are strings.

00:39:09
<transcript>: need to

00:39:11
<transcript>: Need to say new date.

00:39:11
<transcript>: here we do

00:39:16
<transcript>: Here. We do. Yeah, yeah. That should work. And then. So what's the problem.

00:39:16
<transcript>: timer

00:39:18
<transcript>: Timer to ISO string.

00:39:21
<transcript>: I feel like this should all work.

00:39:28
<transcript>: You like this. Should all work. Move a refresh. So what is that? That's the overlay refresh.

00:39:32
<transcript>: Do we have a timer? We have a timer.

00:39:36
<transcript>: 39 minutes into this stream.

00:39:41
cowfacedude99: !today

00:39:41
fossabot: Building a Twitch overlay in Next.JS

00:39:43
<transcript>: Buffet codes. Hey, I'm doing well, how are you.

00:39:44
<transcript>: How are you.

00:39:44
<transcript>: what

00:39:47
<transcript>: What was this you were giving me.

00:39:47
<transcript>: come out

00:39:48
laytanl_: @caldotjs so in your tests Iterm is the slowest by a LOT?

00:39:51
<transcript>: Come out. Oh, a link to the screenshot. Yeah. Let's look at that. I'll pull that up here.

00:39:56
<transcript>: Just catching up on Jet catching up on chat.

00:39:56
<transcript>: the window

00:40:05
<transcript>: The window feature is a pro since you don't need tmux if you use it using Pmux hits performance quite hard as you can see in the other screenshot in the thread.

00:40:05
<transcript>: okay

00:40:06
<transcript>: Okay.

00:40:07
caldotjs: @laytanl_ A LOT A LOT :D

00:40:10
<transcript>: Seriously clean setup. Just use Linux.

00:40:10
<transcript>: yeah i'm using

00:40:12
<transcript>: Yeah. I'm using Mac OS. I'm sorry.

00:40:19
<transcript>: Using Alokready with tmach is still lightyears ahead I term and only slightly worse than algorithm. Some tests.

00:40:23
<transcript>: Both set up and using them depending on my mood. Okay.

00:40:23
<transcript>: calface

00:40:29
<transcript>: Calface. We are. We're not supposed to be building a Twitch overlay. We just. I broke things.

00:40:29
<transcript>: over

00:40:31
aivars_meijers: Yeah, stream deck works after restarting everything and praying a bit

00:40:32
<transcript>: Over my little break yesterday.

00:40:40
<transcript>: And my plan was very much not to work on the overlays. We're just fixing up a couple things. Then we're gonna work on our invention. Config. Actually. Cafes. Perfect day for you to be here.

00:40:40
<transcript>: we're

00:40:49
caldotjs: @caldotjs I meant kitty here when I said alacritty the 2nd time. my bad :(

00:40:50
laytanl_: @caldotjs welp, time to move lol. Thought it was negligable

00:40:52
<transcript>: We're gonna work on the inner config. We're gonna add tree sitter, text objects. We're gonna add. I'm actually gonna learn how surround works. So if you hang out today, you'll get some of that content. You're welcome.

00:40:57
<transcript>: I term as well we might use alacrity. We might install allocrities today.

00:41:03
buffetcodes: Did you mention surround?

00:41:12
<transcript>: We might get everything ready for OBS 28. I'm just in kind of like a update, your dependencies kind of move, you know, like refresh everything. And OBS 28 is officially launched on the ten year anniversary. Now, that was like a date. You know, they weren't gonna miss.

00:41:12
<transcript>: it was ten

00:41:12
systemsc3: Hey guys I have a question

00:41:13
rapscallionreaves: Love some alacritty

00:41:17
<transcript>: It was ten years to the day since the first release of OBS that they released OBS 28 officially.

00:41:17
<transcript>: it could have

00:41:17
stroopwafel26: chat is mass switching to kitty/alacritty from iterm2 right now

00:41:26
<transcript>: It could have it probably still has some glaring bugs. Let's be honest, they were not going to not release it on the ten year anniversary that date was set in stone.

00:41:31
cowfacedude99: I thought so. I was kind of surprised when you didn't raid anyone yesterday

00:41:33
<transcript>: Kitty here when I said Alacrity, yeah, no worries.

00:41:33
systemsc3: Is buttcheeks spelled one word or do you spread them apart?

00:41:33
caldotjs: @laytanl_ you can bench it quite easily with vtbench but imo you can really feel the difference when using it

00:41:36
rapscallionreaves: what is the audio app you're using?

00:41:40
<transcript>: I understood that, caldat. I read it twice, just like you wrote it twice. But I understood what you meant. We're all on same page.

00:41:46
buffetcodes: Check this font @adamelmore : https://typeof.net/Iosevka/ :D I love it!

00:41:46
<transcript>: Did you mention surround? I did Buffett. I did mention surround. We're gonna use.

00:41:46
<transcript>: we're gonna

00:41:49
<transcript>: we

00:41:49
<transcript>: We're gonna use surround.

00:41:56
matty_twoshoes: cannot wait to reduild my entire stream setup from scratch with v28 and the next version of Aitum (automation software)

00:42:01
<transcript>: We actually learn the key commands and stuff because I'm not. I've installed this and I just haven't really used it. Pay system. You have a question. We might have an answer. Welcome to Chat Raps Kalian Love Somalikriddy. Well, then it's settled.

00:42:06
<transcript>: We're using allocating Alec Ritty. Is it a lacarde or alacrity.

00:42:06
<transcript>: pronouncing things

00:42:08
<transcript>: Pronouncing things is not my strength.

00:42:08
<transcript>: i don't know what

00:42:14
<transcript>: sur

00:42:14
<transcript>: I don't know what my strength is, but it's not pronouncing things. Chat is Mass switching to Kitty Alqred for my tripod right now.

00:42:16
rapscallionreaves: I say it the other way

00:42:17
stroopwafel26: it's foldenable

00:42:18
cowfacedude99: I am one of the guys who still use kitty mainly because I am too  lazy to figure out to use alt instead of what mac sends out :(

00:42:20
laytanl_: @caldotjs now the question is: alactrity or kitty

00:42:24
<transcript>: Surprisingly, just rating one yesterday. Yeah. Caufas. Yesterday. The end of the stream was a low point in my streaming history. I've been doing this for a month and a half now.

00:42:29
<transcript>: Yesterday, Thursday, Tuesday, Yesterday, but Tuesday.

00:42:29
<transcript>: i hit

00:42:31
<transcript>: that was about

00:42:31
<transcript>: I hit some lows.

00:42:32
cowfacedude99: iterm*

00:42:34
<transcript>: That was about as depressed as I've been as a streamer.

00:42:39
<transcript>: Started questioning all of my decisions. All my life choices that led to that moment.

00:42:43
<transcript>: Nothing was working. Everything was bad. On Tuesday.

00:42:43
<transcript>: you can go

00:42:47
<transcript>: You can go back and watch a lot if you'd like to be depressed with me.

00:42:58
<transcript>: Head to just in the stream. Didn't even do an outro is just like we're done here. And that was because you guys couldn't hear me. Audio was working. Audio is in the VOD.

00:42:58
<transcript>: audio is

00:43:00
<transcript>: Audio is making it to Twitch.

00:43:00
<transcript>: clips

00:43:02
<transcript>: Clips even showed the audio.

00:43:02
<transcript>: there was no

00:43:06
<transcript>: ethis

00:43:06
<transcript>: There was no audio for the live viewers. And I just said.

00:43:07
stroopwafel26: @cowfacedude99 "macos_option_as_alt yes"

00:43:08
<transcript>: and i closed

00:43:08
<transcript>: Ethis amount.

00:43:09
<transcript>: And I closed the stream.

00:43:17
<transcript>: It was bad, but we're back. I'm feeling great today. Just took a little manual labor yesterday. And I'm feeling fantastic.

00:43:22
<transcript>: Actually, the manual labor. That kind of sucked. I never wanted to do it again.

00:43:26
<transcript>: But cheeks spelled one word. Or do you spread them? Okay.

00:43:26
<transcript>: system

00:43:30
cowfacedude99: @cowfacedude99 I don't want to bother now LUL

00:43:31
<transcript>: Systems. That was your question. That's what you had to ask us.

00:43:33
<transcript>: Okay.

00:43:33
<transcript>: audio app

00:43:36
<transcript>: this is the loop

00:43:36
<transcript>: Audio app is a loop back.

00:43:41
<transcript>: This is the Loopback. It's pretty. It's pretty great. I've heard in the latest.

00:43:41
<transcript>: macos

00:43:46
<transcript>: in ob

00:43:46
<transcript>: Macos with OBS 28 you don't need this anymore because you can do this kind of stuff.

00:43:48
<transcript>: In OBS 28, but.

00:43:51
<transcript>: let it

00:43:51
<transcript>: Check this font.

00:43:53
<transcript>: first

00:43:53
<transcript>: Let it lose.

00:43:56
<transcript>: First we got to open this link.

00:44:00
rapscallionreaves: Oh, its a mac thing.  No wonder its so pretty lol

00:44:00
<transcript>: This is a screenshot of some performance things.

00:44:00
<transcript>: oh you're

00:44:07
<transcript>: Oh, you're nudging me. That's me, Adam. Dev, let's see? And a triangle? Acrid, slash Kitty.

00:44:09
<transcript>: What is this.

00:44:10
caldotjs: @laytanl_ you kinda need tmux or a window manager like yabai when choosing alacritty which slows it down a tiny bit.   kitty: all in one package with the maintainer being a bit weird & toxic  alacritty: technically faster and more minimal, they don't implement a lot of features on purpose

00:44:14
<transcript>: Milliseconds. Lower is better. I'm guessing this is iterm. Yeah.

00:44:17
<transcript>: are

00:44:17
<transcript>: It turns the really big one and then all the other ones.

00:44:22
<transcript>: Are much faster, so dense scrolling.

00:44:22
<transcript>: scrolling

00:44:24
<transcript>: okay

00:44:24
<transcript>: Scrolling Full screen.

00:44:28
<transcript>: Okay. That's convincing. We're gonna try something else.

00:44:32
levifig: iTerm used to be the fastest

00:44:33
<transcript>: The the current plan is alacrity allocating.

00:44:33
<transcript>: alacrity

00:44:34
<transcript>: Alacrity.

00:44:37
levifig: I like Alacritty

00:44:44
<transcript>: And then what did you send me? Font? A font? I'm probably not gonna switch over. I've been using Operator mono for, like, five years. Probably not gonna switch.

00:44:54
<transcript>: This is nice, though. I do like the Saun. Did we ever get rid of our air? Yeah, we got rid of our air. Okay, cool. This is nice. I like it. I'm actually gonna leave this one up.

00:44:54
<transcript>: i like

00:45:00
<transcript>: I like it so much, actually, I'm gonna bring it over here to my new browser, which is this thing.

00:45:00
<transcript>: and we're gonna

00:45:00
buffetcodes: This is really good!! Try it out <#

00:45:02
buffetcodes: * <3

00:45:04
<transcript>: And we're gonna open a new tab in this thing. What is this called again? Arc.

00:45:04
<transcript>: i'm gonna open it over

00:45:05
levifig: no tabs, so be ready for that ( fine for me: I use yabai on macOS and i3 on Linux)

00:45:07
stroopwafel26: @laytanl_ kitty dev also created calibre which I use for ebooks

00:45:07
<transcript>: I'm gonna open it over here so it doesn't get closed if I get.

00:45:09
<transcript>: rick rolled

00:45:09
<transcript>: If I get.

00:45:11
<transcript>: Rick rolled. Okay.

00:45:11
<transcript>: can i

00:45:16
<transcript>: Can I wait to rebuild my entire stream set up from scratch with 28 and the next version of.

00:45:16
<transcript>: ad

00:45:18
<transcript>: Adam.

00:45:18
<transcript>: atom

00:45:19
laytanl_: Tough choice then

00:45:20
<transcript>: Atom.

00:45:20
caldotjs: I can really recommend MonoLisa. using it is so fun

00:45:26
laytanl_: I am using yabai already

00:45:30
<transcript>: You say it the other way. Wraps which one is the other way? Alacrity or alcrydy. Could you try and type out a phonetic pronunciation of that fold in the Bowl.

00:45:32
levifig: Jetbrains Mono is a VERY solid font btw (and free)

00:45:34
laytanl_: I think warp.dev triees to do to much

00:45:36
rapscallionreaves: @laytanl_ Oh that's awesome!  I love calibre

00:45:40
<transcript>: I am one of the guys who still use Kitty, mainly because I'm too lazy to figure out how to use alt instead of what Max sends out.

00:45:42
<transcript>: Alt.

00:45:48
caldotjs: @laytanl_ I highly agree. used it to and there is way to much visual clutter

00:45:49
stroopwafel26: @levifig jetbrains mono gang <3

00:45:50
rapscallionreaves: I say a-lack-ritty not ala-critty

00:45:50
<transcript>: What? Explain cafes, alt the key. I switch my Alton command or whatever.

00:45:55
<transcript>: Now the question is alacrity, or Kitty.

00:45:55
<transcript>: macos

00:45:58
levifig: Alacritty doesn't support ligatures though :(

00:45:58
<transcript>: Macos option as Alt Yes Oh.

00:45:58
<transcript>: okay

00:45:59
<transcript>: Okay.

00:45:59
<transcript>: so maxing

00:46:02
<transcript>: So Maxing. No wonder it's so pretty.

00:46:09
<transcript>: You kind of need tmux or a window manager like you buy when choosing Alikridy, which slows it down a tiny bit.

00:46:09
<transcript>: yeah

00:46:17
<transcript>: Yeah. You don't have like, tabs in Alec Ritty, right? It's just like one thing. You have to open more windows.

00:46:30
<transcript>: I guess that would be kind of bad. We feel a little bad about that. I just the Kitty thing. There's just so many features. It's a little overwhelming, all the thing. It's like I just need to be able to change the font and the color. I can do that.

00:46:30
<transcript>: i don't know that

00:46:32
<transcript>: I don't know that I need.

00:46:32
<transcript>: all the other stuff

00:46:39
<transcript>: All the other stuff. And I don't even need to change the color that's built in that's in Neil them. Right. So.

00:46:54
<transcript>: The maintainer all in one package with maintaining a bit weird. Yeah, and Toxic Alecready technically faster and more minimal. They don't implement a lot of features on purpose. I think the only feature I use is custom font.

00:46:54
<transcript>: and i use

00:46:58
<transcript>: And I use tabs in it so maybe I'd feel bad not having tabs. I guess.

00:47:01
<transcript>: I term used to be the fastest.

00:47:01
<transcript>: says levi

00:47:02
<transcript>: Says Levi.

00:47:08
<transcript>: try that on

00:47:08
<transcript>: Okay, Buffett. You're saying try it out, try out the font.

00:47:10
<transcript>: Try that on what.

00:47:10
rapscallionreaves: I actually hate ligatures in my terminal.  Love it on webpages though

00:47:12
<transcript>: Probably I'm gonna change my editor font.

00:47:27
<transcript>: But I kind of want to use this phone on, like a website or something. It looks nice. It's an open source San Serif and Slab Serif model space, quasi proportional typeface family that's mouthful designed for writing code using in terminals and preparing technical documents.

00:47:27
<transcript>: oh so

00:47:29
<transcript>: Oh, so it's made for code. Okay.

00:47:39
<transcript>: Spatially efficient. This is nice. Do you have to pay for it? Because I'm kind of Snob. And I like using fonts that have to pay for.

00:47:39
<transcript>: why do i like

00:47:45
buffetcodes: Try changing editor font, it's for writing code. Do you know about tsoding? twitch.tv/tsoding

00:47:47
<transcript>: Why do I like paying for things instead of free things? I don't know, but I like it. It makes it feel more official. Like I chose this thing when I buy it.

00:47:47
<transcript>: be ready

00:47:51
<transcript>: Be ready for that. No tabs? Yeah.

00:47:51
<transcript>: i use you by

00:47:53
<transcript>: I use you by so I'm using you by as well.

00:47:59
<transcript>: I would be weird, though, to have all of them.

00:47:59
<transcript>: open

00:48:02
stroopwafel26: Be Dutch, you'll like free things in no time

00:48:08
<transcript>: Open. Like I like having one of my things open and then just like switching back and forth between tabs. I guess I learned tmux that'd be a whole thing.

00:48:10
<transcript>: We'll see.

00:48:10
buffetcodes: He used to use this font, there I got to know about it.

00:48:13
<transcript>: We will see.

00:48:16
buffetcodes: I tried it yesterday, and oh wow - it looks great!

00:48:16
<transcript>: Monolitha is that a font.

00:48:19
<transcript>: Or is that a thing? What is that.

00:48:26
<transcript>: Jetbrain's Mono is a very solid font and free free is a Con for me actually.

00:48:26
<transcript>: levi

00:48:27
<transcript>: warp

00:48:27
<transcript>: Levi.

00:48:32
<transcript>: Warpdev tries to do too much. That's what Kitty does. In my opinion, I don't want to do too much.

00:48:43
caldotjs: I LOVED the thing about paid fonts. I am in the same boat. MonoLisa is the font I use https://www.monolisa.dev/

00:48:45
<transcript>: Jetbrains monogang. I say allocritey, not Ala, Critty. Okay, alacrity. We'll go with the lacqueri.

00:48:45
<transcript>: doesn't

00:48:47
<transcript>: Doesn't support ligatures.

00:48:49
rapscallionreaves: I love tmux.  I have it autostarting in my bashrc and its great to leave commands running on a server

00:48:55
buffetcodes: tmux is good! Just make sure to set escape timeout, you might wanna change a few things here and there. Specially if you use "ctrl+I" in neovim.

00:48:56
<transcript>: But that's okay for Raps, because he hates Ligatures. He or she hates Ligatures in return. Love it on Web pages, though.

00:48:56
<transcript>: okay

00:48:58
<transcript>: Okay. Okay.

00:49:01
<transcript>: More fonts being thrown at me.

00:49:04
<transcript>: Midouch you'll like free things.

00:49:11
rapscallionreaves: +1 to escape timeoute

00:49:14
<transcript>: Okay. We're still on my fonts. I'm not gonna change my phone right now, but I appreciate the suggestions. I love the thing about pay fonts. Same boat.

00:49:14
<transcript>: isn't only

00:49:23
<transcript>: Isn't only Lisa a paid font because you might get me the switch. Now that we're still talking about fonts, I gotta fix something in my overlays. Don't forget someone remind me.

00:49:23
<transcript>: fix the thing

00:49:25
<transcript>: Fix the thing, fix it.

00:49:25
<transcript>: in your overlay

00:49:26
<transcript>: look at this

00:49:26
<transcript>: In your overlay.

00:49:29
<transcript>: Look at this page font. Now we're talking.

00:49:32
avarice: fix the thing

00:49:33
avarice: Kappa

00:49:33
<transcript>: I love Team Max. Okay.

00:49:33
<transcript>: let's

00:49:39
<transcript>: Let's. Let's fix the thing. Thank you, Aberice. Thank you. We're gonna fix this thing.

00:49:39
<transcript>: we have to

00:49:45
stroopwafel26: !topic spending money on fonts while there's a million free choices around

00:49:47
stroopwafel26: MaxLOL

00:49:49
cowfacedude99: I use tmux + vim a lot so I do need alt and ctrl key a lot. and by design mac sends off the option key doesn't send alt key by default which was a pain for me.  iterm2 was easiest to set option as alt and I haven't bothered to switch LUL

00:49:52
rapscallionreaves: dumb question, are twitch overlays just regular html?

00:49:55
<transcript>: We have to format some dates. We have to do it in intro. We have to do an outro. So right here, this is now an ISO formatted. Well, we can just look at it. Check this out localhost. I would also need to test transitions because they may be very broken.

00:50:08
levifig: @rapscallionreaves they are technically done on the client side (OBS)

00:50:09
<transcript>: Yeah, see, now it's an ISO string. We don't want that. That's no good, especially since we're formatting it and saying it's a UTC. And then I throw in the time zone at the end. That's nice touch.

00:50:09
<transcript>: what

00:50:12
<transcript>: What is the CT time Zone anyway.

00:50:12
<transcript>: let's

00:50:13
sparringwithbear: i love working with dates ResidentSleeper

00:50:14
<transcript>: Let's format it. So here.

00:50:14
<transcript>: it's

00:50:15
<transcript>: It's.

00:50:15
<transcript>: format

00:50:20
levifig: @rapscallionreaves and yes: html/css/js

00:50:21
<transcript>: Format. So that's a ISO string. I want to just say.

00:50:24
<transcript>: Format date or something.

00:50:26
<transcript>: Like.

00:50:26
<transcript>: format

00:50:30
<transcript>: Format date? What do we say? Yeah, format date.

00:50:31
caldotjs: @stroopwafel26 & your code screenshots look like any other screenshot :< font snobs unite

00:50:37
<transcript>: Like inventoround is where I could like easily surround this thing.

00:50:37
<transcript>: based on the

00:50:41
<transcript>: Based on the name. That's what it makes sense to me. Right? What's wrong with this.

00:50:43
levifig: @rapscallionreaves you can literally create a PWA, use websockets, connect to APIs, etc

00:50:46
stroopwafel26: fair point

00:50:46
<transcript>: What's wrong? Argument type string. Oh, undefined. So we need to handle undefined.

00:50:49
<transcript>: We'll go to format date.

00:50:49
<transcript>: here and

00:50:52
<transcript>: Here. And we'll say if if.

00:50:52
<transcript>: state

00:50:53
<transcript>: State.

00:50:54
fragaverage: There was me thinking the title meant we weren't looking at Overlays today üëÄ

00:50:56
<transcript>: It's not date.

00:50:56
<transcript>: return

00:50:57
<transcript>: Return.

00:51:00
<transcript>: Empty string. I don't know. I could probably just.

00:51:01
<transcript>: do

00:51:03
<transcript>: Do unfine. There.

00:51:03
rapscallionreaves: @rapscallionreaves gotcha.  I know you can add a browser source in OBS, I just didn't realize how simple it was server-side.  Well, how simple it can be

00:51:06
<transcript>: But let's see if that.

00:51:11
<transcript>: date

00:51:12
<transcript>: String on the finest side of the parameter. Oh, I need to actually change the signature, right.

00:51:13
<transcript>: Date.

00:51:13
<transcript>: or

00:51:15
<transcript>: Or string.

00:51:16
<transcript>: we'll just do like this

00:51:17
<transcript>: We'll just do like this.

00:51:17
<transcript>: yeah

00:51:19
<transcript>: Yeah, Yeah.

00:51:26
<transcript>: I don't like that. You're still there.

00:51:26
<transcript>: ls

00:51:28
<transcript>: Lsp restart.

00:51:32
<transcript>: Why you in my face like that. I feel like I'm broken them.

00:51:36
<transcript>: Well, let's close it, let's reopen.

00:51:46
<transcript>: Something I've noticed with the oven. You do run into a few little visual glitches. Sometimes that happens on occasion.

00:51:46
<transcript>: but

00:51:51
<transcript>: But I come some flag because it's pretty awesome, and I feel like I don't feel like I'm missing much.

00:51:51
<transcript>: if anything

00:51:57
<transcript>: If anything from my vs code days just been a couple weeks few weeks feels pretty good.

00:51:57
<transcript>: so we got

00:52:02
<transcript>: So we got the format date there. Now we also want to add it to.

00:52:10
<transcript>: Scheduled. Any other instances of scheduled? Yeah. Right there.

00:52:13
<transcript>: So format eight.

00:52:19
<transcript>: Learning them.

00:52:26
<transcript>: Any others. Now that's all, is there any actual starts, actual.

00:52:28
<transcript>: Okay.

00:52:28
<transcript>: save

00:52:31
<transcript>: Save those now let's do.

00:52:36
<transcript>: Scheduled start. I think outro.

00:52:38
<transcript>: There's gonna have it.

00:52:38
<transcript>: and then

00:52:39
<transcript>: And then.

00:52:39
<transcript>: might be

00:52:41
<transcript>: Might be it.

00:52:41
<transcript>: here

00:52:44
<transcript>: Here format date.

00:52:55
sparringwithbear: someone tell me to go build my stuff instead of being on twitch :'(

00:53:01
<transcript>: It's hard I can't see anything in my terminal because of keycaster I wish I could have keycaster only be visible.

00:53:05
<transcript>: To you all where I don't have to see it. That'd be cool.

00:53:05
<transcript>: that'd be

00:53:07
<transcript>: That'd be great actually.

00:53:10
<transcript>: start

00:53:10
<transcript>: Scheduled.

00:53:11
<transcript>: Start.

00:53:13
<transcript>: That's the only one. Okay.

00:53:16
<transcript>: Save that. Let's save everything.

00:53:18
cowfacedude99: @sparringwithbear stay here, LUL

00:53:24
<transcript>: Actual start.

00:53:28
<transcript>: I think it's just gonna be index.

00:53:36
<transcript>: That one we fixed. So did I fix ATRO so that we fixed after. Yeah. Okay.

00:53:38
<transcript>: And break.

00:53:38
<transcript>: just break

00:53:39
<transcript>: Just break.

00:53:42
sparringwithbear: @cowfacedude99 bet

00:53:42
rapscallionreaves: @sparringwithbear but if you leave, then I'll feel bad and have to work too

00:53:43
<transcript>: Have any instances of dates.

00:53:44
shn4ke: i think there is an obs plugin you should be able to use

00:53:50
<transcript>: It just shows the title. Okay, cool. We did it.

00:53:50
<transcript>: let's check let's

00:53:54
<transcript>: Let's check. Let's check. The transitions are not completely broken. How about that.

00:53:56
shn4ke: for key strokes

00:53:56
<transcript>: How about that.

00:54:03
<transcript>: And how do I want to do that first? I want to make sure this is all running, right? Yeah. Okay.

00:54:06
<transcript>: Just real quick.

00:54:06
<transcript>: transition

00:54:08
sparringwithbear: i'm staying @cowfacedude99 's has a good point Kappa

00:54:08
<transcript>: Transitions.

00:54:12
<transcript>: Let's check how you see that.

00:54:12
<transcript>: let's check

00:54:14
<transcript>: Let's check. I can now search.

00:54:14
<transcript>: let's

00:54:24
<transcript>: Let's check the transitions are not completely broken. How about that? And that's pretty cool, actually, to have my transcript right here.

00:54:36
<transcript>: In my overlays project where I can live grip find stuff you all say in chat, find stuff I said from earlier, just like that and I've got time stamp this happened at 53. 54. Look at that.

00:54:36
<transcript>: that's so great

00:54:42
<transcript>: That's so great. I'm so glad I built that feature. Even though it was an absolute nightmare. Do I want to ride it? No.

00:54:43
<transcript>: Alright.

00:54:50
<transcript>: Let's do it. Let's transition, and let's see.

00:54:50
<transcript>: does it credit

00:54:58
<transcript>: Does it credit? Like, seven people? No, just one Killion. It was Killing's Animation. So it credited Kilian. And that's what it should have done from the beginning.

00:54:58
<transcript>: thank you for the

00:55:01
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow in the GZO.

00:55:07
<transcript>: Did I miss any other follows? No. Thank you all for following along.

00:55:07
<transcript>: so whatever

00:55:12
<transcript>: So whatever this stream is, what do we do on this stream anyway? Someone tell me.

00:55:12
<transcript>: what i've worked

00:55:17
<transcript>: What I've worked on Twitch overlays for, like, a month. Two months. I don't even know. It's been a long time.

00:55:21
<transcript>: Staying calf face has a good point.

00:55:26
<transcript>: There's an OBS plugin you should be able to use for keystrokes. Oh, thank you, snake.

00:55:29
<transcript>: Who's leaving.

00:55:29
<transcript>: what

00:55:30
<transcript>: What.

00:55:30
<transcript>: 's this about

00:55:33
<transcript>: 's this about leaving Frag is here.

00:55:42
<transcript>: Was me thinking that titlenet we weren't looking at overlays today. Me too, Frag. And then I broke some things we had to fix them in the overlay. I'm sorry.

00:55:42
<transcript>: i really didn't

00:55:53
<transcript>: I really didn't want to work on it all today. I want to work on public Dev. And I think I will. But first, we're gonna work on the oven. Big. We might install alacrity. Allocreting. Which one did you like? I don't remember.

00:55:58
<transcript>: I don't remember spending money on Font while there's a million free choices.

00:56:01
<transcript>: Yeah, that's a topic.

00:56:19
<transcript>: So Calf Face uses T Max plus them a lot, so I do need Altin control key a lot. And by design Mac sends off the option key. Doesn't send all key by default, which is a pain for me. Yeah, I don't understand all modifier keys. To be honest, I don't even know what any of them are called anymore. I just my brain started shutting off.

00:56:29
stroopwafel26: chat did it, I'm not creating an alacritty config and I might switch terminals for the second time in a week

00:56:30
<transcript>: the

00:56:30
<transcript>: At some point when I got used to, like, seeing people list out key maps for things that they wouldn't list it in Mac, and I have to translate to like, what is this? Like.

00:56:38
<transcript>: The circle. Like the icon. Looks like that. Because you tell what it did with my fingers. There. Like, what is that thing? I don't know. Command.

00:56:38
<transcript>: meta

00:56:48
<transcript>: Meta. What is that key? I don't know. So I just stopped trying. I knew it. Shift is. And then all the other ones are. Just try it until you figure out which one they met. That's how I do. Gmaps.

00:56:57
<transcript>: Dumb question our Twitch overlays just regulate HTML mine is a next JS app so it is.

00:57:01
<transcript>: A React app.

00:57:05
sparringwithbear: @stroopwafel26 the human brain is indeed amazing

00:57:11
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow Blue Blue PT. But how about regular HTML making a comeback? All these cool frameworks enhance that Div from the Begin.com folks.

00:57:11
<transcript>: you've got

00:57:14
<transcript>: no one talks about

00:57:14
<transcript>: You've got Astro.

00:57:22
<transcript>: No one talks about anything on Twitter anymore. They just talk about Astro. Just Astro stuff. We're gonna stream some Astro stuff, though. I've definitely.

00:57:22
<transcript>: like

00:57:25
<transcript>: Like drank the Cool aid.

00:57:28
rapscallionreaves: big fan of Hugo for static html

00:57:29
<transcript>: Wraps. Thanks for the follow this very minute.

00:57:37
<transcript>: They're technically done on the client side. Obs. I love what working with dates. I don't I love eating dates. Got any date fans.

00:57:37
<transcript>: we eat

00:57:45
then3rdman: asro is sweet,

00:57:50
<transcript>: We eat a lot of dates. And it's September now September 1. This is the month we get to order dates from Bautista family Farm, also known as Seven Hotdates.com. They're the best they have.

00:57:50
<transcript>: they have

00:57:51
<transcript>: They have.

00:57:51
<transcript>: we get

00:57:53
caldotjs: @cowfacedude99 you can fix that quite easily: https://gist.github.com/calwritescode/4e430ec018925b73431beb0c88311203

00:57:55
<transcript>: We get a lot of honey dates. A lot of Cadra dates.

00:57:57
<transcript>: We get a lot of.

00:57:57
<transcript>: the

00:58:13
stroopwafel26: ok I'm running alacritty now instead of kitty MaxLOL

00:58:16
cedpoilly: dates are great right after hard manual work @adamelmore

00:58:17
<transcript>: The what's the other one that we get? We don't do the bar heat and there's another date we don't do. We do like four different varieties of dates. We order like ¬£20 each. We spend like $2,000 on dates in September. It is our is the next closest thing to Christmas in this household is the day they open up the date shop. Let me tell you a story.

00:58:24
then3rdman: trying it on a current proect for work. hoping the prefetch library works well though

00:58:25
<transcript>: So seven hot dates. They're a family farm in California that they grow dates. I'm talking about the food dates every time I say dates right now.

00:58:25
sparringwithbear: i've lived in morocco for the past decade , i'm done with dates lmao

00:58:31
<transcript>: Like the fruit. So they have, like a pit. They're like a big, giant raisin.

00:58:31
<transcript>: so

00:58:36
<transcript>: So this family has this farm and they sell dates at like farmers markets in California.

00:58:36
<transcript>: but they

00:58:41
<transcript>: But they also sell them online. And they have this website, seven hot Dates.com. Check it out.

00:58:53
<transcript>: Every year in September. So for, like, ten years, we've been buying dates from them online. I think that's about right. Since we went vegan, like, ten years ago. So we eat a lot of dates.

00:58:59
<transcript>: Every year, like the second or third week in September.

00:59:05
<transcript>: They open up online orders and every year for at least the last five years.

00:59:05
<transcript>: i have

00:59:25
<transcript>: I have written we'll do it on screen. This year I've written like a monitor. They're very simple little HTML page. They have a very simple little, like online store. And their page doesn't change all year until they open up the store. And then that day they'll publish their site and open up orders. And the HTML will change. I write like a very.

00:59:25
<transcript>: simple

00:59:31
<transcript>: Simple little like Cron thing that's just every minute checking their site to see if the HTML changed.

00:59:31
<transcript>: i usually

00:59:38
<transcript>: I usually just deploy it like as a Lambda function with EventBridge triggering. So AWS stuff.

00:59:38
<transcript>: but

00:59:50
<transcript>: But when the chain, when the page changes, we place an order immediately. We know exactly what we're going to order. We've been there first order for at least like five years. I don't know if they even know as they notice that we order like minutes after they publish.

00:59:50
<transcript>: their upd

00:59:51
<transcript>: Their update to their site.

00:59:51
<transcript>: so

00:59:54
<transcript>: So funny story is so the funny part of all that.

00:59:54
<transcript>: is i've

00:59:57
<transcript>: Is I've been doing that for, like, five years.

01:00:01
cowfacedude99: cmd -> windows key/(meta for linux) alt -> option. ctrl and shift are the same. nothing against anyone using mac, but apple needs to get on with the world for the keyboard.

01:00:02
<transcript>: Last I first started doing it when I said Statinus, my startup and I got a message.

01:00:02
<transcript>: just this year

01:00:07
<transcript>: Just this year is like a few weeks ago from one of my former employees.

01:00:07
<transcript>: said

01:00:07
lukeyfam15: üëã

01:00:08
<transcript>: Said.

01:00:08
<transcript>: they were

01:00:13
jaystation3x: it me

01:00:14
<transcript>: They were. I don't think this is J. If Jay's listening, he might know. Maybe it was Jay. I thought it was Patrick.

01:00:21
<transcript>: Jay, if you're here, you'll know, if it was you, either Jay or Patrick, a couple of my employees that sat Me's.

01:00:26
stroopwafel26: hey @jaystation3x

01:00:33
<transcript>: Sent me a message and said, hey, I was going through our atabs account, and for a moment I thought somebody had, like, gotten into our account and created this weird infrastructure. I couldn't understand what it was.

01:00:33
<transcript>: and then he looked at

01:00:41
jaystation3x: Patrick and I were pairing and found it.

01:00:43
<transcript>: And then he looked at the source for this Lambda function, and he realized it was like hitting the seven hotdates calm and checking to see if it changed. Once he realized what it was doing, he knew it was me.

01:00:46
<transcript>: That made me laugh. I don't know.

01:00:54
<transcript>: Anyway, you love working with dates. I love eating dates. Seven Hotdates Calm. This is my plug. I need to get a sponsorship from them. Lar Bar. Seven hotdates.com.

01:00:54
<transcript>: i will only

01:01:01
<transcript>: I will only work with them. So you want to sponsor me? Sorry. Those are the only two people I will ever work with.

01:01:07
<transcript>: Maybe mode keyboards. I would I would definitely take a mode keyword sponsorship. Just if I get more keyboards, that'd be cool.

01:01:12
<transcript>: Code screenshots look like any other screenshot.

01:01:12
<transcript>: fo

01:01:14
lukeyfam15: Hru?

01:01:14
<transcript>: Fonts nubs, unite.

01:01:18
<transcript>: Literally create a PW. Okay, I'm just catching up here on chat.

01:01:30
<transcript>: Someone tell me to go build my stuff instead of being on Twitter. Go build your stuff sparring.

01:01:30
<transcript>: just go

01:01:36
<transcript>: Just go build your stuff. You can stay, you can just listen it's called coworking. I hear. Just stay and listen.

01:01:39
jaystation3x: I can't believe I tuned in just 30 seconds before you told that story.

01:01:43
<transcript>: I tell you. Thank you for the follow. Nerd. Man, I really appreciate that follow during my weird date story.

01:01:49
<transcript>: Don't. Nobody has to leave. Listen, you don't have to leave. You can hang out.

01:01:49
<transcript>: you can

01:01:58
<transcript>: You can leave if you want to leave, it's fine. I'm gonna pressure you, but I know a lot of people here are working and listening. You just kind of, like, hang out with me.

01:01:58
<transcript>: you chat

01:02:02
<transcript>: You chat and chat. Occasionally you post messages, but I get to read.

01:02:02
<transcript>: it mix

01:02:09
<transcript>: It mix my day a whole lot better. So I really appreciate those who hang out here and still get work done. Still get work done.

01:02:11
<transcript>: Okay.

01:02:11
<transcript>: so if you

01:02:14
<transcript>: So if you fix the transition thing.

01:02:20
<transcript>: Not creating an electric config. And I might switch terminals for you.

01:02:33
<transcript>: Big fan of Hugo for static HTML. Yeah. So there's some people who've been around, right? Eleven D. Hugo, like normal HTML sites seem to be coming into Vogue.

01:02:39
<transcript>: And some of them have been here all around all along Astro is sweet.

01:02:39
<transcript>: oh

01:02:45
<transcript>: Oh, Astro. Yeah, yeah. Just type over there. Welcome to Chat Nerd. Man. I appreciate you joining us in Chad as well.

01:02:53
<transcript>: Okay, I'm running a lacarde. Now. Instead of Kitty. Look at you. Stroop. Two terminals. One week, two emulators.

01:02:53
<transcript>: dates are

01:02:58
caldotjs: @stroopwafel26 lets goo

01:02:59
<transcript>: Dates are great right after hard manual work. That's right. And really great before too. They give you a lot of energy.

01:03:03
<transcript>: Hoping to prefetch library works well.

01:03:08
godbless_27: i'm guilty that i'm here for coworking mostly

01:03:11
<transcript>: You've lived in Morocco. So you're done with dates. You get a lot of dates there and grow a lot of dates.

01:03:16
caldotjs: I currently have both alacritty and kitty running :>

01:03:19
<transcript>: Yeah, I agree. Cafes the Mac keyboard situation. I'm not a fan.

01:03:27
<transcript>: Not a fan. Hey, Luki. Oh, Jay's, here. Was it you? Patrick and I were pairing, and I found it and found it. Okay. So it was you and Patrick. Great.

01:03:31
<transcript>: You turned in 30 seconds. Sorry, that's too funny.

01:03:31
<transcript>: i'm good

01:03:34

01:03:37
<transcript>: I'm doing great. Got a bit of a sniffle today, I guess.

01:03:45
<transcript>: Hey, Adam. Greetings, eggs. Greetings from Denmark. Not sure the shipping of dates makes sense.

developmentrobot: since we're on keyboards, I'm waiting for the kinesis 360 drop tomorrow, hopefully I'll snatch one

01:03:47

01:03:47
<transcript>: I can't grow them where I live.

01:03:51
lukeyfam15: I'm doing good.

<transcript>: it's just a hard

01:11:52
<transcript>: It's just a hard path. I don't know. I have a hard time with even things that would be better for me.

01:11:54
puccababy: hah, I'm working for a fashion startup, I'm never not-working.

01:12:01

cowfacedude99: look at dactyl. they can be literally how you want.

01:12:29
caldotjs: @stroopwafel26 why are you using xterm-256color over alacritty? and your alt commands probably wont work in nvim with that config

01:12:30
levifig: I thought of recording one but didn't (yet)‚Ä¶ ;;swea

01:12:34
<transcript>: Latent has the Advantage 360 NL but it was from Amazon. Oh you can buy them on Amazon. Are you kidding me.

01:12:45
<transcript>: This is advantage to like this.

01:12:53
<transcript>: Is that it? You just bite on Amazon. I don't need to wait. Oh, that's, like, not split, like one big thing.

01:12:54
caldotjs: @developmentrobot too much effort :( and I don't know a good one

01:12:56
stroopwafel26: @stroopwafel26 because I ssh to a lot of servers and I don't want to install the alacritty term everywhere

01:12:58
<transcript>: This one is split.

01:12:58
<transcript>: okay

puccababy: @seannyy_ Edinburgh (Leith)

01:13:33

cowfacedude99: this is mine, but with black and red keycaps and black background https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0025/7697/3935/products/sa-portal-dactyl_1024x1024@2x.png?v=1634309005

01:16:14
stroopwafel26: My wife is very strict but I'm not and the kid knows it MaxLOL

01:16:19
<transcript>: It's not Loua. And I feel like I've got a thing going where all my config is Lua, and I don't want to break it.

01:16:19
<transcript>: thank you so much

01:16:21
uberrick: Also, did you check out Primes vim stream last night?

01:16:21
levifig: important chat messages will be resurfaced or repeated anyway ;)

01:16:23
<transcript>: Thank you so much. Hi Joe, for the follow. Appreciate that.

01:16:36
<transcript>: Rick is here. I am not being convinced for a split keyboard. They still don't check the aesthetic box. Maybe someday I'll see enough of them. If I just keep looking at them, I'll be like Sign to grow on me and then it'll do it for me. But.

01:16:38
<transcript>: Do it for me. Not yet.

01:16:47
<transcript>: Yeah. Levi. I'm so bad about reading every single message. I need to really.

01:16:47
<transcript>: i

01:16:51
<transcript>: I met a size already that makes reading every line of chat virtually impossible.

01:16:51
<transcript>: to

01:16:56
<transcript>: To want to achieve anything in the stream other than chatting. Yeah. Maybe I should just change the category of just chatting.

01:17:04
<transcript>: I don't I do actually want to accomplish some things in life and in my work.

01:17:09
<transcript>: Your wife is very strict, but I'm not in the kid knows it.

01:17:09
<transcript>: yes then they come

01:17:11
<transcript>: Yes. Then they come to you right. Okay.

01:17:18
<transcript>: Here we are Indian surround. So cafes. I'm gonna keep trying with the Louis thing. Let me give the Lua one.

01:17:18
<transcript>: a fair shot

01:17:27
<transcript>: A fair shot. Okay. We're gonna go this around. We're gonna look at. Okay. So we're doing nothing in the config. Cool, cool.

01:17:32
<transcript>: Is this the right one that I'm using in them? Surround.

01:17:33
<transcript>: A plugin.

01:17:39
<transcript>: This is the one that I'm using. Yes. Kyle, chewy.

01:17:39
<transcript>: indians round

01:17:41
<transcript>: Indians. Round. Okay.

01:17:47
<transcript>: So add delete change surrounding page function calls an HTML tag. That's the kind of thing I want to do.

01:17:47
<transcript>: repeat

01:17:49
<transcript>: Repeat previous actions.

01:17:49
<transcript>: let me do that

01:17:57
cowfacedude99: the config requires almost nothing.

01:17:57
<transcript>: Let me do that. That's built into them, right? I'm just. It's saying the features that are included in this thing also support this stuff.

01:18:09
<transcript>: Right. Or is that how I'm able to dot repeat from intervimsuround? I doubt it. Set buffer, local mapping and surrounds jump to the nearest surrounding pair. Should I watch the video? Let's just watch the video.

01:18:09
<transcript>: why not

01:18:10
<transcript>: Why not.

01:18:10
<transcript>: i can make

01:18:13
<transcript>: I can make this bigger for you all.

01:18:16
<transcript>: Okay, so read me.

01:18:24
<transcript>: This is a test sense. So what did they do? I got to watch this waste lower. They're typing. So, so fast.

01:18:26
<transcript>: Cst.

01:18:33
<transcript>: Four day? What are they doing.

01:18:35
cboorg: vim dot repeat doesnt always work on these custom things that plugins do

01:18:41
<transcript>: How does anyone know what's going on? When you watch stuff like this? I can't.

01:18:41
cowfacedude99: You can fullscreen the video.

01:18:43
bigdiff___: you can lower the speed in the player

01:18:44
<transcript>: Okay VT.

01:18:44
<transcript>: oh so

01:18:48
<transcript>: so

01:18:48
<transcript>: Oh, so that that's how they surrounded. So this. Okay.

01:18:59
<transcript>: So they back up, back up. I want to I think I could actually follow this one. They did VT exclamation Mark, and then they did what? How did they do the surrounding that's the only thing I really need to learn.

01:19:01
<transcript>: Bt.

01:19:01
<transcript>: x

01:19:02
<transcript>: X.

01:19:02
<transcript>: xl capital

01:19:07
cedpoilly: I think there's a slow mode for the chat? Maybe that could help you @adamelmore?

01:19:08
<transcript>: Xl Capital SL I guess that depends on your key bindings, but let's just see if that's what's built in. So if I want to.

01:19:17
<transcript>: If I want to surround let's go, let's actually go in here VT. So if I'm in this tag and I'm like.

01:19:20
<transcript>: V. To there, and I want to surround it.

01:19:20
<transcript>: i do

01:19:22
<transcript>: I do SL.

01:19:27
<transcript>: It.

01:19:30
<transcript>: Let's just see what the default key maps say.

01:19:41
<transcript>: Tag use for stability omit to use main branch to the latest features.

01:19:47
<transcript>: Okay, the three core operations of Add Delete Change can be done with the key maps.

01:19:53
<transcript>: Ys Motion Character, DS Character, and CS Target replacement.

01:19:53
<transcript>: respectively

01:19:57
<transcript>: Respectively. So the following examples star will denote the kirshberge cursor position. Okay.

01:19:57
<transcript>: see i think

01:20:11
<transcript>: See, I think the first time I didn't read this bit, and when I looked at this, I was like, what is that wild card doing in there? Like, what's going on? But that's the cursor position. Okay, so I'm right here, and I'm gonna surround words. Let's just try this. We're gonna try each one of these things.

01:20:11
<transcript>: i want

01:20:18
<transcript>: I want to surround this word, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna do, like a strong emphasis on this word. So I'm right here in the middle of the word, and I do.

01:20:22
<transcript>: Ysi W? Prins.

01:20:31
<transcript>: Surround. So I'm surrounding it with parems is what it's saying. So let's try that. I want to I want to surround it with.

01:20:35
<transcript>: More than a Prin. I want to surround it, but does it work with other things.

01:20:38
<transcript>: Because it works.

01:20:42
<transcript>: Cs.

01:20:42
<transcript>: let's just try

01:20:45
<transcript>: Let's just try so YSI W.

01:20:45
<transcript>: that's a mouthful

01:20:47
<transcript>: That's a mouthful.

01:20:49
<transcript>: Isi Wu.

01:20:56
<transcript>: So that was starting to type stuff around it. Right. So. Okay.

01:21:05
<transcript>: let's

01:21:05
<transcript>: We're tag types. So you can just do H one for a tag so I can do like strong. Okay. So.

01:21:06
<transcript>: Let's do it.

01:21:08
<transcript>: y

01:21:08
<transcript>: It'd be.

01:21:11
<transcript>: w

01:21:11
<transcript>: Ysi.

01:21:12
<transcript>: W.

01:21:17
<transcript>: So inside. So why? S is what? What is YS stand for.

01:21:19
<transcript>: I wish I knew what it stood for.

01:21:24
<transcript>: Is almost nothing. Yeah. Okay.

01:21:35
<transcript>: Slow mode for the chat. Maybe that could help you. Maybe said Polly. I don't think I'm that far along yet.

01:21:43
<transcript>: How big this says I can lower speed. I think we're good now with this usage block. I think this is gonna be everything I need.

01:21:43
<transcript>: the video

01:21:49
<transcript>: The video is just too much for me. I'm not really a visual person. I'm not like a visual learner. So why s stands for something.

01:21:49
<transcript>: inside

01:22:00
cowfacedude99: ys is prefix. iw is inside words and ) for paran

01:22:01
<transcript>: Inside, and then W would be like word. So I'm in this word. I'm just trying to like into it. I want to understand. What are these? He can't peek in, man's mean. So why s means something.

01:22:01
<transcript>: in

01:22:04
<transcript>: In surround. I guess it'd be like.

01:22:07
cboorg: "ys" is kinda how you initialize adding a surround

01:22:10
<transcript>: Ys? Versus delete? S? So y.

01:22:14
<transcript>: Initialize adding a strand. Okay.

01:22:14
<transcript>: it's a prefix

01:22:17
cowfacedude99: ys is kind of a prefix

01:22:19
<transcript>: It's a prefix. Iw is inside words. And that for print. Yay. Yeah, yeah. Okay.

01:22:22
<transcript>: So I want to do.

01:22:22
<transcript>: ys inside

01:22:28
<transcript>: Ys inside word, and then I'm gonna do this. Goes to a strong so YS inside word, strong.

01:22:28
<transcript>: no okay

01:22:31
<transcript>: let's do

01:22:31
<transcript>: No okay can't do can't do that.

01:22:38
<transcript>: Let's do just Paren just to see the example work. So why us inside Wordprint? Yeah. Nice. Oh, feels good.

01:22:40
cboorg: try ysiwt

01:22:42
<transcript>: and all of it

01:22:42
<transcript>: Them. There's just something about them.

01:22:48
cboorg: then you can surround with a tag

01:22:53
<transcript>: And all of it's plugins or neovem. I guess something about just vim movements that feel good, they just feel nice. It's the most like I've been enjoyed the feeling of typing.

01:22:56
uberrick: for tags is looks like you'd do like cstb<CR>

01:22:59
<transcript>: Ysiwt. Then you can surround with the tag. Okay.

01:22:59
<transcript>: for tags it looks

01:23:01
<transcript>: For Tags. It looks like you do.

01:23:01
<transcript>: cst

01:23:02
<transcript>: Cst.

01:23:02
<transcript>: b

01:23:04
<transcript>: B.

01:23:04
<transcript>: garage

01:23:08
<transcript>: Garage return. Let's try what Seabork said here.

01:23:08
<transcript>: t

01:23:14
<transcript>: T and then I can type the tag. Maybe. So if I'm here y s IWT.

01:23:14
<transcript>: strong

01:23:16
<transcript>: Strong? No.

01:23:22
cboorg: yes

01:23:26
<transcript>: Maybe I didn't do it fast enough. Y S I WT Nope. Oh, yeah, that was capital T. I mean, that's what you meant.

01:23:26
<transcript>: tag

01:23:26
cboorg: you see the bottom

01:23:27
uberrick: basically the second from bottom

01:23:30
<transcript>: Tags? Yes. Okay. So y inside of you. Capital T.

01:23:33
cboorg: it asks for the tag

01:23:35
cboorg: then enter

01:23:36
<transcript>: I have to do Capital T. I think I could have done lowercase. Let's try it again.

01:23:40
<transcript>: Wyatt, and then type it. Yeah.

01:23:40
<transcript>: nice

01:23:41
<transcript>: Nice.

01:23:41
<transcript>: feels

01:23:46
<transcript>: like

01:23:46
<transcript>: Feels good. Okay. This is worth learning, because this is.

01:23:49
<transcript>: Like stuff that's nice to do.

01:23:49
<transcript>: so i

01:23:51
<transcript>: So I could do that for the whole thing. I could be like.

01:23:51
<transcript>: let's just do this let's

01:23:53
<transcript>: Let's just do this. Let's go.

01:23:58
<transcript>: Capital Fi to go back there, and then I'm gonna do.

01:24:02
devopstty: looks so complicated

01:24:04
<transcript>: Not a word. If I want to do the whole line, what would I do? So there. They're just doing, like dollar sign.

01:24:04
<transcript>: so

01:24:08
<transcript>: So they're on the beginning of the line and they do dollar sign.

01:24:08
<transcript>: to surround the whole thing

01:24:10
<transcript>: To surround the whole thing.

01:24:10
<transcript>: so i

01:24:11
<transcript>: So I could do like.

01:24:11
<transcript>: y

01:24:13
<transcript>: to the

01:24:13
<transcript>: Ys.

01:24:19
cowfacedude99: end of line is $

01:24:19
<transcript>: To the end of the line T, and then type the tag, I'm gonna put that in a span. Nice.

01:24:21
<transcript>: Feels good.

01:24:31
puccababy: I have vi keys burned into my brain (back from when there was no choice). Imma glad I live in VSCode world these days VoHiYo

01:24:32
<transcript>: Feels good. Looks so complicated. Yeah. I think DevOps, it's complicated at first. And then once it becomes just like muscle memory. It's amazing.

01:24:32
<transcript>: so

01:24:37
neochromer: are we doing development in Neovim?

01:24:37
<transcript>: So you do have to, like, spend a lot of time, I guess like investing into.

01:24:39
<transcript>: Accepting these things.

01:24:39
<transcript>: but once

01:24:41
<transcript>: But once you do.

01:24:44
<transcript>: Once you do Yeah.

01:24:48
neochromer: hello btw

01:24:50
<transcript>: I have the keys burned into my brain back from when there was no choice.

01:24:54
neochromer: also I do azure pipelines currently

01:24:56
<transcript>: I'm glad I live in Via Code World these days? Yeah, no, I get it. I totally don't like I spent.

01:24:56
<transcript>: whatever

01:25:03
cboorg: vim feels good when you dont think about what you have to do

01:25:07
<transcript>: Whatever the last five years deep Envious code and I felt really good about my VSCO setup, and then I just abandoned it because I've given Twitch streamer, and when you Twitch stream, you have to use them. It's in the handbook.

01:25:19
zebbath: heraSup

01:25:19
<transcript>: Yeah, but I get it. I'm never gonna shame someone for the editor they use. You won't hear that on this stream. Just totally open to whatever you use unless it's like no pad plus block Blust. And then thanks. I'm just kidding.

01:25:22
<transcript>: This is the first one that came to my mind.

01:25:22
<transcript>: what's up

01:25:24
<transcript>: What's up, Zivis? How's it going.

01:25:28
<transcript>: It feels good when you don't have to think about ways.

01:25:43
purrplish: Even if you don't use Vim, the keybindings are really useful in any editor that supports them.

01:25:48
cedpoilly: I use vscode on twitch. That's why I have like 6 viewers üòÜ

01:25:48
<transcript>: so if i'm

01:25:48
<transcript>: Once you get to the point where there's some other than movies that I just don't have to think about anymore. And they feel good. There's some that I'm still getting there. Like I'm still trying to get better with horizontal movement. So like go back the eye with Fi or forward to the R like that and then I can toggle through them if I had some more well, like here.

01:26:00
cboorg: @cedpoilly LUL

01:26:01
<transcript>: So if I'm like, F, I said to practice Roswell, you know, F. R, and then I'm like, oh, not that one. Yeah, that one. That's the one. I'm gonna replace it with capital. I. No, just practice. Okay, so we're doing surround.

01:26:12
<transcript>: The Y s. Is how you start surrounding. And then DS is how it would delete the surround. So if I want to delete. Okay. So we're coming down here, and I want to delete.

01:26:22
<transcript>: These brackets. What do I do? So I'm in the middle here of this thing. I say, I don't want brackets anymore. Oh, or I could replace them. Yeah. Okay.

01:26:22
<transcript>: we're gonna say

01:26:25
<transcript>: We're gonna say, I don't want brackets anymore. We're going to.

01:26:25
<transcript>: ds

01:26:27
cboorg: dsB @adamelmore

01:26:29
<transcript>: Ds DS bracket.

01:26:34
<transcript>: Dsp.

01:26:34
<transcript>: tie remove

01:26:38
<transcript>: Tie, remove HTML Tags. So if I'm in this and I say, DST.

01:26:47
<transcript>: It's rid of the surrounding HTML tag. Super cool don't have to type what tag because it's just whatever tag is around it. Right.

01:26:47
<transcript>: so

01:26:53
<transcript>: So DST that's an ice one and then change. So CS is change.

01:26:53
<transcript>: change quotes

01:26:57
<transcript>: Change quotes. So here, I want to change. Let's see.

01:26:57
<transcript>: can i do that

01:26:59
<transcript>: Can I do that with Tags.

01:26:59
<transcript>: yeah

01:27:00
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:27:00
<transcript>: cst

01:27:03
<transcript>: Cst One Carriage return.

01:27:10
<transcript>: So I could change this Div to a span. So if I'm like CS.

01:27:12
<transcript>: csp

01:27:13
<transcript>: Csp.

01:27:20
<transcript>: And then type the tag name so span.

01:27:24
<transcript>: I'm gonna get this. I'm gonna I'm gonna figure this out.

01:27:28
uberrick: @cedpoilly just put neovim in your stream title for click bait

01:27:29
<transcript>: Delete. Function calls function calls delete.

01:27:29
<transcript>: function

01:27:42
<transcript>: Function calls. What does that mean? So if there's a okay. So if I'm calling a function that just feels so like language specific, I would think. But it works for any language. Or it works with the LSP.

01:27:45
vorqrin: csT also removes classes when changing tag i think

01:27:46
<transcript>: So how it works.

01:27:50
<transcript>: Neocromer. We are doing development in the OFM.

01:27:52
<transcript>: Azure pipelines.

01:27:55
<transcript>: Where does that come from? Did we start talking about.

01:27:56
cowfacedude99: @cboorg the thing I like about tmux and vim is that once you get used to them, editing is a breeze

01:28:04
<transcript>: Not like being critical that you brought this up. I just want to make sure I missed some context earlier. You just talking about CI CD pipelines.

01:28:04
<transcript>: cloud providers

01:28:05
<transcript>: Cloud providers.

01:28:09
neochromer: @adamelmore We talked about devops lol

01:28:10
<transcript>: Vim feels good when you don't think about what you have to already read that. Yeah.

01:28:14
neochromer: and I just said I work on Pipelines hah

01:28:15
puccababy: @purrplish 100% - some of this is not that different than some mappings / macros I have setup in VSC. Cool stuff. Also, whatever editor gets the work done right? I never cared for those fights!

01:28:17
<transcript>: I have like six viewers. I mean.

01:28:17
<transcript>: i definitely

01:28:22
<transcript>: I definitely saw. The more I started talking about Neovim, the more people seem to want to watch.

01:28:22
<transcript>: there

01:28:30
cboorg: @cowfacedude99 yuuup you just fly around and never have to leave the terminal

01:28:32
<transcript>: There's something about that on Twitch. I don't know what it is about me of M on Twitch. I'm glad that I started streaming, and I'm glad that I started playing with the oven because I love both.

01:28:32
<transcript>: and i don't think

01:28:39
<transcript>: And I don't think I love them both because they come together. I think I love them both independently. And I wouldn't have probably discovered them.

01:28:39
<transcript>: i wouldn't discover

01:28:42
<transcript>: I wouldn't discover ne of them. Had I not come to Twitch. I don't think.

01:28:47
<transcript>: I wouldn't have felt compelled. Switch, I guess.

01:28:50
<transcript>: Dsb Cyborg. What was that for.

01:28:50
<transcript>: put

01:28:54
<transcript>: Put neovimision title for clickbait that's right.

01:28:54
cedpoilly: @uberrick üòÜ ~~~ I could have a 15 minutes session at the beginning of each live

01:28:59
<transcript>: Cst also removes classes when changing tag. I think, oh, interesting.

01:28:59
<transcript>: so capital

01:29:10
<transcript>: so i would

01:29:10
<transcript>: So Capital T would also remove the classes vorten. Welcome to Chat and thank you for that tip. We'll try it right now, so I'm on a tag, and I'm like, I'm gonna change this Div here.

01:29:15
<transcript>: So I would just do CST span if I want to.

01:29:15
<transcript>: oh

01:29:21
schrew: Gm!

01:29:22
<transcript>: Oh, I did CDT, did I? So I do CST if I just wanted to change it to a span, right.

01:29:22
<transcript>: but

01:29:28
<transcript>: But if I wanted to do that in removed class names Ado, CS, Capital, T, span.

01:29:35
<transcript>: Feels good. Thank you so much, Morgan. Welcome to Chat. Thank you for the tip or vorcrin.

01:29:37
<transcript>: Vorcrin.

01:29:44
<transcript>: The thing I like about Team Mucks and Vim is that once you get used to them, editing is a breeze. That's what we're hoping.

01:29:44
<transcript>: we talked about

01:29:46
<transcript>: We talked about DevOps. Gotcha.

01:29:46
<transcript>: you should work on pip

01:29:49
<transcript>: You should work on pipelines. Okay. Gotcha. Yeah.

01:29:49
<transcript>: we do

01:29:53
<transcript>: We do talk about DevOps on this channel sometimes.

01:30:08
purrplish: @puccababy Agreed.

01:30:08
<transcript>: I'm actually more of a backend in DevOpsy person. That's more what I do. It doesn't seem like it on the stream. In the stream. I seem to only fiddle with front end stuff because it takes me so long. If front ends didn't take me so long, I'd mostly be working on back ends.

01:30:11
fragaverage: Overlays in particular LUL

01:30:17
<transcript>: Okay.

01:30:21
<transcript>: Okay. Good morning. Shrew.

01:30:30
<transcript>: Good morning. Overlays. In particular. What was that? In response to Frag? I'm sorry. I'm just. I'm always. I need to do better.

01:30:30
<transcript>: need to keep

01:30:31
<transcript>: Need to keep up better.

01:30:33
fragaverage: Only working on front end stuff

01:30:37
neochromer: I work as frontend for years and I'm not that faster :D could also be that my brain is a bit slow lol

01:30:43
<transcript>: Okay. So we've learned how to delete, replace, and add things around. I wanted to check the function calls. I guess that works with the LSP. I'm guessing. So if I'm in.

01:30:43
<transcript>: a function call

01:30:49
<transcript>: A function call like this and I want to delete the whole function. You're saying I can do DSF.

01:30:49
<transcript>: it's not that

01:30:52
<transcript>: function call

01:30:52
<transcript>: It's not that it's it's something else. Here.

01:30:57
<transcript>: Function calls. Oh, it just deletes the function. Okay.

01:30:57
<transcript>: can i do that

01:31:01
<transcript>: Can I do that with replace? I can't imagine there'd be a case where I'd be like, you know what.

01:31:01
<transcript>: i want to get

01:31:03
<transcript>: I want to get rid of.

01:31:09
<transcript>: Just the function name, but nothing else. I could see how I'd want to replace it.

01:31:18
<transcript>: So DSF just delete to use events and also deletes the open print. I'm not sure what the use case is there.

01:31:18
<transcript>: if i

01:31:20
<transcript>: If I do CSS.

01:31:22
zappy_oc: daf to delete the whole function

01:31:26
<transcript>: Oh yeah enter the function name.

01:31:26
rjayuu: If you have nvim-treesitter-objects, you can do 'daf' or 'dif'

01:31:28
<transcript>: Cool. Okay. Css does that.

01:31:30
cedpoilly: would you consider having a Front-End dev paring with you on the Front-End part?

01:31:32
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't know why I delete it, but.

01:31:36
<transcript>: Okay.

01:31:36
<transcript>: feels pretty good

01:31:41
puccababy: I've been a FED since... well since Front End was a thing. My brain is definitely slower these days.

01:31:42
<transcript>: Feels pretty good. I mean anything else will want to learn here with Surround, or do we want to move on to items.

01:31:42
<transcript>: text objects

01:31:43
<transcript>: Text, objects.

01:31:59
uberrick: did you catch Primes stream last night?

01:32:00
<transcript>: Only working on pre. Yeah, yeah, only working on overlays. Seems to be the case. We're gonna work on public Dev. I want to touch it today. At least we're gonna touch it. We do have some stuff I want to do here. Any of them config, but we're gonna touch public Dev. At least.

01:32:03
<transcript>: I.

01:32:07
<transcript>: Working for.

01:32:07
<transcript>: work

01:32:18
<transcript>: Work as front and for years and not that faster could also be the brain is a bit slow. I feel like I've been working with front ends as long as I've been working with anything and I still I don't seem to be getting better at it.

01:32:18
<transcript>: it's just not

01:32:26
<transcript>: It's just not how my brain worked, I guess. Daf to delete the whole function. Oh, thank you, Zappi. Welcome to Chat. So you're saying this function here.

01:32:31
<transcript>: This function. Here. I could do Das.

01:32:32
<transcript>: F.

01:32:36
<transcript>: fide the

01:32:36
<transcript>: fide the function

01:32:38
<transcript>: Fide. The function DAFF.

01:32:41
<transcript>: Maybe that's something I haven't mapped.

01:32:43
<transcript>: Delete the whole function.

01:32:43
<transcript>: teresa

01:32:45
<transcript>: Teresa objects. That's what we're doing next.

01:32:53
laytanl_: you need the textobjects plugin for that

01:32:56
<transcript>: Reju. Welcome to Chat, both of you. Zappi and RJU, we are going to add treater objects right now. That was the next thing I wanted to do.

01:32:59
<transcript>: Research.

01:33:03
<transcript>: You've been here before.

01:33:06
<transcript>: Is that like a Hobbit reference.

01:33:10
traylortrash84: Good morning.

01:33:14
<transcript>: I visited a link. That's what hit, that's what hits my brain. So as I visit the link that I visited before.

01:33:14
<transcript>: we've been

01:33:16
<transcript>: We've been here before.

01:33:34
<transcript>: Syntax aware text objects, select move, swap, and peak support. Tree Sitter and Inventory sitter are an experimental feature of nightly versions of Neovem. Please consider the experience with this plugin. It's experimental until tree Sitter support. You know what I consider everything I do with the OFM experimental. I feel like this is like the.

01:33:34
<transcript>: it's

01:33:40
<transcript>: It's like I think of the Star Wars prequels. Something just mentioned that Star Wars Frequels on Twitter.

01:33:40
<transcript>: so i

01:33:48
<transcript>: So I blame them. It's in my brain. I think of like Anakin Skywalker building his, like building his little.

01:33:59
cowfacedude99: they haven't updated the readme in a while.

01:34:09
<transcript>: One of those called on the Tatooine. The little like, the Pod Racer. He's building his little Pod racer out of, like, scratch, scrap metal and stuff he finds on the sidewalk. Or I guess there's a sideBOX in tattooing it's there. But he's like, putting it together, right? Really scrappy. And he flies around in it. I feel like that's Neoveim, this is a pretty good analogy. Actually, I'm terrible at analogies, but this.

01:34:09
<transcript>: one's not bad

01:34:14
rjayuu: The only time I have issues with nvim and plugins, is after I build a new dev release nvim

01:34:19
cowfacedude99: treesitter has been standard for two whole version upgrades I think

01:34:29
<transcript>: One's not bad. And then like somebody who I don't know builds like official Pod racers. That would be like Via SCode. They're like, polished, and they have nice, slick parts that they purchased with money on tattooing, whatever currency they're using in tattooing. Yeah. So Neovem, I just assume that's kind of the experience. There might be some rough edges, but like, I'm gonna go fast.

01:34:29
<transcript>: faster than

01:34:31
<transcript>: Faster than you watch.

01:34:31
<transcript>: right

01:34:38
<transcript>: Right, Anakin Skywalker, anybody. If nobody on here knows anything about Star Wars, and that was just a waste of time. I'm sorry.

01:34:46
stroopwafel26: Star Wars > Star Trek

01:34:51
stroopwafel26: starting a flame war here

01:34:58
<transcript>: What I consider a frontend of pairing with me on the front end part. I absolutely would. I know some front indepth and maybe you're a frontend deadstead Polly. I definitely would consider that. That would be a good guesstream. Somebody builds the front end part. Or you didn't mean this really on stream. You just spent generally, like, working with frontend devs. I.

01:34:58
<transcript>: do like

01:35:00
<transcript>: Do like working with people who are good at what they do.

01:35:14
<transcript>: Friend of Sense. Well since front end was a thing, brand is definitely slower these days. I think it's age. I think I'm just my age is catching up with me. Did you catch prime stream less? I didn't. Rick was it so good.

01:35:18
<transcript>: Okay. Good morning. Trailer.

01:35:23
<transcript>: They have an updated reading while so I shouldn't worry about this.

01:35:23
<transcript>: this

01:35:24
<transcript>: This warning? Here.

01:35:36
cedpoilly: I am a Front-End dev. but mostly Vue.js & Yeah I meant in general

01:35:36
<transcript>: Only time I have issues with Envy and plugins is after I build a new Dev release. Yeah, I don't do the Dev releases. I think I'm using I'm using .8 so maybe I am doing latest.

01:35:43
rjayuu: That's probably wise..

01:35:43
uberrick: It was a vim stream so he had questions fired about how he navigates and vim plugins he's got setup

01:35:49
<transcript>: Trueholders upgrades. Okay, cool. Star wars greater than Starcheck starting flame more. I mean, I agree just because I don't know any of my Star Trek. But I don't think Starch is bad. I just haven't watched it.

01:35:49
<transcript>: i can't

01:35:57
<transcript>: I can't I can't watch things that there's that much of, you know, like, there's only a few Star Wars movies, and they're long. But like, I can sit through if these Star Wars movies.

01:36:00
<transcript>: All right? So.

01:36:13
<transcript>: There's a vim stream. So we had questions fired about how he navigates into influence. You got set up. Oh, nice. I will have to watch that one. I was watching one of his YouTube videos about it's, like from a couple years ago about Vin navigation.

01:36:17
<transcript>: That guy. He's a Treasurer.

01:36:17
<transcript>: okay

01:36:18
seannyy_: I get you, it's a commitment thing

01:36:22
<transcript>: Okay. We were going to install tree center text objects.

01:36:26
<transcript>: So we're going over here and we're using.

01:36:26
<transcript>: not been plugged

01:36:28
<transcript>: Not been plugged we are using.

01:36:35
<transcript>: I have instructions on Packer. I guess. Just the name of the thing, right.

01:36:39
<transcript>: I already have tree sitter, so we're just gonna go.

01:36:40
stroopwafel26: @adamelmore was bashing my head against the wall after some issues with your nvim config, only to discover homebrew supplied nvim 0.7 instead of 0.8 hahaha

01:36:42
uberrick: one of the main things I picked up was jumping to a point on the line by using f<char>

01:36:43
<transcript>: Presetter.

01:36:43
<transcript>: pl

01:36:45
<transcript>: Plugins.

01:36:45
<transcript>: here

01:36:46
<transcript>: Here.

01:36:46
<transcript>: so

01:36:54
<transcript>: So here's where we have treatsitter. I don't know about this whole commit thing. I get where Chris it machine was coming from. I could get it, but also.

01:36:58
<transcript>: Kind of like having the latest, you know, the latest.

01:36:58
<transcript>: the very latest

01:37:00
<transcript>: The very latest and greatest.

01:37:02
<transcript>: Oops.

01:37:06
<transcript>: I'm gonna just remove this commit.

01:37:11
<transcript>: Feel bad? Does it feel bad.

01:37:12
jeusto: Do you guys have a good video or article to create a full lua nvim config ? I have like 300 lines in .vimrc and ~10 plugins

01:37:12
<transcript>: Just a little.

01:37:14
puccababy: my world is vanilla JS (ES6), React, and... a lot of CSS etc. I may be cursed.

01:37:15
<transcript>: Oh perfect time to use invent.

01:37:15
<transcript>: so here

01:37:16
seannyy_: also did you get new switches or something? Sounds different

01:37:20
<transcript>: So here we have some brackets that I just want to get rid of, right? So I'm just gonna get rid of.

01:37:20
<transcript>: first

01:37:22
<transcript>: First.

01:37:22
<transcript>: i'm gonna go the end

01:37:33
<transcript>: I'm gonna go the end line and delete that comment too. Okay so to delete them I would do BS. Hang on, don't tell me I'm not looking at chat anyway so you can type it if you want DS.

01:37:37
<transcript>: Bracket? Is that it.

01:37:37
uberrick: ds]

01:37:45
<transcript>: Yes. Bracket. It worked. It worked, it worked. It worked at work. Okay. It's gonna add trees that are text, objects.

01:37:45
<transcript>: just like that

01:37:47
<transcript>: Just like that.

01:37:47
<transcript>: upd

01:37:49
cboorg: pinning to commits/versions is good if you dont really want any surprise breaks for your work environment

01:37:55
<transcript>: Updated LSP saga. So this is the problem with not pinning them to commit is you just get updates.

01:37:55
<transcript>: thing

01:37:56
<transcript>: Thing.

01:37:58
<transcript>: On accident. I don't know what.

01:37:58
<transcript>: ls

01:38:02
<transcript>: Lsp Sacka changes. We just introduced. I hope they're good.

01:38:02
<transcript>: hope they're not

01:38:04
<transcript>: Hope they're not bad.

01:38:09
<transcript>: What else do we update? Get signs. Updated. Cloak. Leighton, look at you.

01:38:09
<transcript>: you make

01:38:12
<transcript>: You make an oh, you just fixed a typo in the dock.

01:38:19
<transcript>: I'm so glad you made cloak. It's so cool. It's one of those things. Like.

01:38:19
<transcript>: you see

01:38:24
uberrick: I've YOLO'd my plugins. Latest for everything

01:38:30
<transcript>: You see a repos sometimes, Leighton, and you just know it's gonna be awesome. Like, I just the moment I saw it, the name you just named it perfectly, like Cloak. So cool.

01:38:34
cboorg: same LUL @UberRick

01:38:38
<transcript>: And then just like looking at the read and just like the whole thing is immediately. I knew I knew we were in the midst of greatness.

01:38:38
<transcript>: we were in the

01:38:41
<transcript>: We were in the presence of Greatness Leighton is a star.

01:38:41
<transcript>: and poke

01:38:41
cowfacedude99: @Jeusto there was a good one in last year's vimconf for conversion. and a few more are there too. prime has one too.

01:38:43
<transcript>: And Poke is amazing.

01:38:49
<transcript>: Okay, so we have surround. We have tree sitter text objects now. So you're telling me.

01:38:52
<transcript>: All I need to need to configure it right.

01:38:55
laytanl_: LOL yeah just a typo

01:38:57
<transcript>: So I have to configure these all independently. Select.

01:39:04
<transcript>: Are these all defaults? Define your own text objects mapping similar to IP, Interparagraph and AP.

01:39:05
laytanl_: Thanks for the kind words!

01:39:11
<transcript>: I wonder if this is all just default config or if I need to actually.

01:39:18
<transcript>: Lsp interope okay peak definition code show text object surrounding definition as determined using.

01:39:20
<transcript>: Lsp.

01:39:20
<transcript>: in a floating window

01:39:20
cboorg: good work @laytanl_

01:39:24
<transcript>: In a floating window, press the shorter twice into the floating window.

01:39:32
<transcript>: Good one last year's VM. Comp for conversion in a few more of their two prime has one two.

01:39:34
jeusto: @Jeusto Thanks, I

01:39:35
jeusto: I

01:39:38
jeusto: I'll check it out

01:39:42
<transcript>: Okay, you guys saw my good good resources Stroop.

01:39:42
<transcript>: and you were bashing your head

01:39:52
<transcript>: And you were bashing your head against the wall after some issues with your invim. Could Big only discover Homebrew supplied engine seven and ten. Eight. Yeah, mine is using eight. I should probably update to read me.

01:39:59
<transcript>: Thank you so much. El charisman, for the follow. I appreciate your follow a lot.

01:39:59
<transcript>: i really

01:40:04
<transcript>: I really do I just I love, I love streaming so much, I love.

01:40:04
<transcript>: that my work

01:40:11
<transcript>: That my work is no longer just me sitting in my office alone, that I have 84 of you sitting here talking with me. It's the best.

01:40:11
<transcript>: this is the

01:40:14
cowfacedude99: and you might want to look at nanotee's guide for neovim guide too

01:40:15
stroopwafel26: we love that you started streaming

01:40:21
<transcript>: This is the absolute best. So when someone follows me. Ah, thank you so much. The salt seat for the follow. When you follow me, I know that's somebody that wants to be here more. And I want you to be here more. So it's mutual.

01:40:21
<transcript>: there's this mutual

01:40:26
<transcript>: There's this mutual understanding that we like each other's company. And I really like it.

01:40:26
<transcript>: a whole lot

01:40:27
<transcript>: A whole lot.

01:40:27
<transcript>: okay

01:40:28
<transcript>: Okay.

01:40:32
cowfacedude99: it is one of the best guides on configuring neovim in lua

01:40:36
<transcript>: So I was looking for an answer in chat. Actually, I came over here to look for an answer. Not that I'm just using chaff for answers, but.

01:40:36
<transcript>: one

01:40:38
<transcript>: One of the best guides.

01:40:38
<transcript>: on

01:40:40
<transcript>: On if you're any of them in Lua.

01:40:40
<transcript>: thank you

01:40:43
<transcript>: Thank you, Stroop. That you love that I started streaming.

01:40:43
<transcript>: i was

01:40:49
<transcript>: I was looking for. I think it's the defaults. These are probably just the defaults, right.

01:40:49
<transcript>: should i copy and

01:40:52
<transcript>: Should I copy and paste all of this stuff into things into.

01:40:52
<transcript>: some config i

01:40:57
<transcript>: Some config. I can't say that into some config. Into some config.

01:40:57
<transcript>: i need to drink

01:41:01
<transcript>: I need to drink some fake copy so I can be really on top of it. This is all the stuff.

01:41:02
<transcript>: that

01:41:03
<transcript>: what are these

01:41:03
<transcript>: That it does.

01:41:05
<transcript>: What are these.

01:41:13
cowfacedude99: I don't think there's any default in treesitter

01:41:15
<transcript>: Oh, wow. And then these are the LSPs and what it supports in each one. Wow. I'm gonna I'm getting ready to get so many more features. Let's go down here to TS server and see what I'm about to get.

01:41:15
<transcript>: i need to add

01:41:20
<transcript>: I need to add the markdown. We got to add that to our list. I don't have a list.

01:41:28
<transcript>: Typescript, all these things we're about to get. I don't know what they are because the heading is way up there, but, oh, look at all those green dots. I'm so excited.

01:41:32
laytanl_: Ok I moved to alacritty

01:41:44
stroopwafel26: nice!

01:41:45
<transcript>: This is just reminding me. I need to look into more LSDs like there's things in here I probably use JSON was comments. I should add that. Oh, it doesn't have any texts. Okay, I guess I still should probably add it should have a JSON language server. Right.

01:41:48
<transcript>: There's a GraphQL language server.

01:41:50
<transcript>: Interesting.

01:41:55
<transcript>: Alright. All right. Here we go. Here we go. We're gonna do this.

01:41:57
<transcript>: To do.

01:42:00
<transcript>: Md.

01:42:02
<transcript>: To do.

01:42:02
<transcript>: let's see

01:42:05
<transcript>: Let's see. We want to.

01:42:05
<transcript>: add

01:42:06
<transcript>: Add.

01:42:09
<transcript>: Markdown.

01:42:09
<transcript>: mark

01:42:13
<transcript>: Mark down to let's see. We want to add.

01:42:16
<transcript>: Json LSP.

01:42:16
<transcript>: we

01:42:18
<transcript>: We want to.

01:42:23
<transcript>: Add.

01:42:25
<transcript>: Text.

01:42:25
<transcript>: object

01:42:28
<transcript>: Objects which we're working on right now.

01:42:31
<transcript>: What else did I want to do in my end, config. I think that's it.

01:42:31
<transcript>: oh graph

01:42:35
<transcript>: Oh. Graphql. We want to graph. Qlsp. Maybe.

01:42:35
<transcript>: add

01:42:37
<transcript>: Add graph.

01:42:37
stroopwafel26: @laytanl_ just finished my config but I'm not entirely convinced about font rendering compared to iterm2 and kitty

01:42:39
cowfacedude99: @adamelmore those are languages supported by treesitter. LSP and treesitter are completely separated.

01:42:39
<transcript>: That's good.

01:42:39
<transcript>: save

01:42:47
<transcript>: Save. Yes. What to do is previously created. What? I already created this.

01:42:52
<transcript>: Did I no.

01:42:54
<transcript>: I don't think so.

01:42:54
<transcript>: i don't think so

01:42:57
<transcript>: I don't think so, Tim. I think it's brand new. There it is. There's already.

01:42:57
<transcript>: so

01:43:00
<transcript>: So let's finish adding text objects.

01:43:06
<transcript>: And let's see. We added it here. We need to go in here to plug in.

01:43:06
<transcript>: and we need

01:43:11
uberrick: the pain when your first TODO of an md file is to add support for md haha

01:43:12
stroopwafel26: TODO.md was created Tuesday :P

01:43:13
<transcript>: And we need to add it. Should I add it in this plugin directory? Someone explained to me what that was. This is where we've got a bit of LSB stuff.

01:43:13
<transcript>: wonder if i should add it

01:43:15
<transcript>: Wonder if I should add it here.

01:43:23
<transcript>: Those are languages supported by tree setter. Lsp. Intruecenter are completely separated. Right. Right. Okay. So these aren't like these languages.

01:43:23
<transcript>: are

01:43:28
laytanl_: @stroopwafel26 I got it pretty close to my Iterm setup by fiddling with the config

01:43:30
<transcript>: Are completely separate from your LSP config. Okay, you just answered my question. Then I'm gonna put it up here next to treatment.

01:43:36
<transcript>: I want to put it in the same file. I just want to put it in my tree. Sitter, config. Maybe.

01:43:36
<transcript>: maybe

01:43:37
<transcript>: Maybe.

01:43:43
<transcript>: Parsers. Yeah. We're gonna just add it to this tree. Sitter, file.

01:43:45
<transcript>: Foldenable.

01:43:48
laytanl_: Mainly letter spacing was very tight

01:43:53
<transcript>: Okay.

01:43:55
<transcript>: Let's do.

01:43:56
stroopwafel26: @laytanl_ can you share yours?

01:43:57
<transcript>: Text, objects.

01:44:00
<transcript>: Next objects.

01:44:02
stroopwafel26: exactly, spacing is weird

01:44:09
<transcript>: Okay. Real bad when I'm working on a file like this and I can't see anything I'm typing because of keycaster.

01:44:09
<transcript>: you will not

01:44:15
<transcript>: You will not see anything. I'm tired because the keycaster as well. Yeah. Okay. So we have the same problem here.

01:44:15
<transcript>: where should i put

01:44:18
<transcript>: Where should I put keycaster? I just don't know what it belongs.

01:44:18
<transcript>: where it's not

01:44:20
cowfacedude99: that goes in the ts.setup @adamelmore

01:44:23
<transcript>: Where it's not in my face. I could put it at the top. No, it feels bad.

01:44:26
neochromer: top right?

01:44:27
<transcript>: I could put it in the middle.

01:44:29
purrplish: Us too

01:44:31
<transcript>: My Chrome key.

01:44:31
sirtimme: center bottom?

01:44:35
<transcript>: Slide keeps going off dries me crazy.

01:44:40
<transcript>: gotta fix it

01:44:40
<transcript>: Driving me crazy.

01:44:41
<transcript>: Gotta fix it.

01:44:41
uberrick: @SirTimme ^^

01:44:50
<transcript>: Just accidentally changing lights.

01:44:54
<transcript>: Okay.

01:44:58
laytanl_: @stroopwafel26 https://gist.github.com/laytan/a38d0f2741de2a73f2ccfc31e052e58b

01:45:01
<transcript>: Back on and then I got a did that even fix it.

01:45:01
<transcript>: i feel like

01:45:03
<transcript>: I feel like I fixed it.

01:45:03
<transcript>: still

01:45:05
<transcript>: chrome

01:45:05
<transcript>: Still really bad.

01:45:07
admiralnapman: when you type zz in nvim your cursor will get centered and you can read better than having it on bottom

01:45:09
<transcript>: Chrome a key bad. I think it's my key light and he's turn it back up.

01:45:12
<transcript>: Not too much.

01:45:15
<transcript>: Not too much, but enough.

01:45:15
<transcript>: okay

01:45:20
<transcript>: Okay. I think that fixed. Maybe some of the chromosome key issues. We still got some issues.

01:45:23
<transcript>: Maybe since I reset up my office.

01:45:26
<transcript>: That's better, though. Okay.

01:45:33
<transcript>: So text objects. We're going to configure it right here.

01:45:40
<transcript>: The pain when you're first to do of an MD file is to add support for MD exactly.

01:45:44
<transcript>: It's created Tuesday. What.

01:45:54
<transcript>: Did I create it on Tuesday and this I don't think I did in this directory. I mean, in this thing, right? I created that in the that was in the overlays repo.

01:46:08
stroopwafel26: oh i'm sorry, my brain gets confused by todo lists

01:46:09
<transcript>: That goes in the PS setup. Oh, it does. You're saying I can figure up here. I'm going to add this plugin.

01:46:09
<transcript>: let's just look

01:46:11
<transcript>: Let's just look at this.

01:46:18
<transcript>: Fire tree sitter configs. So I have to do all those things separate. But first I have to, like, just add it to text objects.

01:46:18
<transcript>: or

01:46:21
<transcript>: Or add it to tree, sitter.

01:46:21
<transcript>: and then

01:46:27
<transcript>: And then three circuit. Yeah. Yeah. Text objects right here. Okay. I'm guessing all of this is like default, though.

01:46:29
stroopwafel26: @laytanl_ thanks, x offset is perfect :)

01:46:31
<transcript>: Am I wrong.

01:46:40
<transcript>: Preseater configs. Perfect. Okay. So we're gonna do text, objects.

01:46:45
<transcript>: This all just default.

01:46:47
<transcript>: Define your own text object mapping so.

01:46:57
<transcript>: These are and then they're gonna walk through each of the things right? I'm gonna paste all this in, even if it's default.

01:47:02
<transcript>: Just so I can look at it if nothing else method expected.

01:47:02
<transcript>: x

01:47:05
<transcript>: X object equals out.

01:47:07
<transcript>: Json, people.

01:47:13
<transcript>: Okay.

01:47:22
<transcript>: Select enabled true automatically jump forward text object similar to targets of them.

01:47:22
<transcript>: key maps

01:47:26
<transcript>: Key Maps You can use Capture Groups to find in textobject. Scm.

01:47:36
<transcript>: So much configuring here to do, isn't there? I guess that's the whole point. That's why I signed up for new of them. Right. You can choose the select mode. Default character is v.

01:47:38
<transcript>: Default is.

01:47:42
<transcript>: Car Wise v. Anyone know what that means.

01:47:45
<transcript>: Neocromer says top right.

01:47:49
<transcript>: Center bottoms. There, Timmy says. Maybe those are better.

01:47:55
<transcript>: When you type ZZ and NVM, your cursor will get centered.

01:47:55
<transcript>: you can read better

01:48:00
<transcript>: You can read better than having it on the bottom when you type ZZ and invent oh really.

01:48:03
<transcript>: Zoozi.

01:48:03
<transcript>: oh

01:48:06
<transcript>: Oh, what if you're at the bottom of the buffer? So if I go down here.

01:48:06
<transcript>: i'm right here

01:48:10
<transcript>: I'm right here at the bottom, and I type ZZ. Oh, it still does it.

01:48:18
<transcript>: Nice. Same. Thank you so much, Adrian. I really appreciate that. See, I'm glad I read every message. I'd miss stuff like that.

01:48:23
<transcript>: Offset is broken anyway.

01:48:29
<transcript>: Anyway, center bottom. That's the vote for keycaster. So let's ties a bunch of stuff.

01:48:31
<transcript>: Let's move it.

01:48:35
<transcript>: That is still better. I think aesthetically. The problem is.

01:48:35
<transcript>: it doesn't

01:48:35
uberrick: Prime added zz to the end of some of his mappings

01:48:41
<transcript>: It doesn't like grow in both directions. You know, I'm saying so like if I type a little bit.

01:48:43
<transcript>: I'll show you.

01:48:48
<transcript>: Like that's kind of centered. But do I optimize for.

01:48:48
<transcript>: that

01:48:52
<transcript>: That or to optimize for like I typed a lot. There it all goes.

01:48:52
<transcript>: i guess

01:48:58
<transcript>: I guess I can make the width so that's the Max width. Yeah, yeah. I want it centered.

01:48:58
<transcript>: like perfect

01:49:08
<transcript>: Like, perfectly. I wish I could just type in, like, into the config. Like, center it'll do that. Okay. We're gonna go with that. It's pretty good.

01:49:14
<transcript>: So now it's gonna kind of not be centered. This could bother me so much. It's not centered in less.

01:49:26
<transcript>: Unless I type a lot, but I do type a lot, right? We'll be doing Jays in no time. We'll be so glad it's sinners like that. Oh, it's not centered. What was I even thinking? Okay.

01:49:30
<transcript>: We're gonna optimize for not a lot of text.

01:49:34
<transcript>: I'm done.

01:49:34
<transcript>: i promise

01:49:37
<transcript>: I promise. Okay.

01:49:37
<transcript>: okay

01:49:38
<transcript>: Okay.

01:49:38
<transcript>: select

01:49:40
<transcript>: Select over here.

01:49:43
<transcript>: I said that there we go.

01:49:47
<transcript>: This swap. We have Select.

01:49:56
<transcript>: This is swap. Define your map. We just swap the node under the cursor with the next or previous one, like function parameters or arguments. That sounds amazing.

01:49:56
<transcript>: that sounds

01:49:58
<transcript>: That sounds like.

01:49:58
<transcript>: some

01:50:01
<transcript>: Some vs code stuff I do.

01:50:03
<transcript>: So let's do.

01:50:07
<transcript>: Actually let's do require.

01:50:16
<transcript>: Visual mode.

01:50:16
<transcript>: copy

01:50:18
uberrick: try the jump to char on a line. Like f@ to jump to the first @ on a line for example

01:50:19
<transcript>: Copy. I don't want all that. Actually, I just want to flop.

01:50:22
<transcript>: Swap? Yep.

01:50:24
<transcript>: These are visual.

01:50:24
<transcript>: yank

01:50:44
<transcript>: Yanket and go over here. Look at this. Didn't even use my mouth. People. We're getting so good at this Neoven stuff or Ven stuff or whatever it is. So paste it on the next line. Why doesn't that paste it on the actual next line? When I hit P, I expect it to go to the next line Calico and then paste it, but it paste it like right where my cursor is at. Is that a setting? Did I mess up.

01:50:44
<transcript>: something

01:50:47
<transcript>: Something with P.

01:50:56
<transcript>: Oh, it's easy to end them. Some of this mapping that makes a ton of sense.

01:51:03
<transcript>: Try to jump to character online. Like F at to jump to first at online. Yeah, I've been working on that one.

01:51:03
<transcript>: so that

01:51:09
<transcript>: So that is something Uber or Sorry, Rick, that I've been working on is my horizontal net.

01:51:10
<transcript>: neto back

01:51:10
<transcript>: neto

01:51:11
<transcript>: Neto, back.

01:51:11
<transcript>: to the w

01:51:14
<transcript>: To the W. I do just like that.

01:51:14
<transcript>: i'm gonna go full

01:51:22
<transcript>: I'm gonna go full forward to the T. I go like, that. And I'm like, oh, not that one. That one. I'm just gonna keep practicing. You.

01:51:28
<transcript>: Know the page down and page up thing. I don't know if I'll ever get it or if I'll just J my way into Infinity.

01:51:32
<transcript>: It was like my future is still with Jays in case.

01:51:40
<transcript>: What do we do here? We added Swap. So enable through swap next liter. A parameter inner.

01:51:49
<transcript>: A previous leader? A leader. Capital A. We're gonna learn what all this means? We're gonna learn soon enough.

01:51:58
<transcript>: new of them's mapping

01:51:58
<transcript>: First, we have to copy all this config move. Define your own mapping to jump to the next or previous text object similar to that.

01:51:59
<transcript>: New of them's mapping.

01:51:59
<transcript>: next to previous

01:52:01
<transcript>: Next to previous function.

01:52:04
<transcript>: Okay.

01:52:04
laytanl_: Try control U and control D instead of page up or down

01:52:08
<transcript>: We're going to we're gonna add all this config.

01:52:08
<transcript>: control

01:52:11
<transcript>: Control U and DEA.

01:52:11
<transcript>: instead of page

01:52:20
<transcript>: Instead of page up, and yeah, that's what I meant when I said page up and page down, I meant Control U and Control D. I don't actually hit like a page up key. I do have it on my keyboard, though, but I don't use it.

01:52:24
<transcript>: Okay.

01:52:25
<transcript>: Move.

01:52:31
<transcript>: This one, we're gonna copy all this config.

01:52:33
<transcript>: Over here.

01:52:39
<transcript>: Why does that go to the next line? If should based on what I understand of them.

01:52:43
<transcript>: So let's move. Then we're gonna go over here again.

01:52:43
<transcript>: we're gonna get

01:52:45
<transcript>: We're gonna get.

01:52:45
<transcript>: this

01:52:48
<transcript>: This text. Object. Lsp. Interact.

01:52:52
<transcript>: Lsp interrupt.

01:52:54
<transcript>: Let's see. Interrupt.

01:53:03
<transcript>: Okay. So we've added all the configured text objects, right.

01:53:06
<transcript>: Overriding our extending.

01:53:11
<transcript>: Custom Capture built in captures.

01:53:11
<transcript>: i don't know

01:53:29
<transcript>: I don't know what these are yet. Attribute inner block and error. Okay, so these are like constructs, but this is not related to your LSP. You're telling me like text objects. They've just like, done all this work to figure out what all these things are independent of your LSP. Feels like they're doing a lot of the same work as the LSP.

01:53:29
<transcript>: looks like they should

01:53:34
<transcript>: Looks like they should combine forces and save themselves a little work, you know, I'm saying.

01:53:34
<transcript>: can't believe that's

01:53:36
<transcript>: Can't believe that's separate.

01:53:39
<transcript>: It's crazy to me.

01:53:44
<transcript>: Just work with your LSP somehow. I guess it kind of does this LSP interope. At least.

01:53:50
<transcript>: Peak definition Code So Leader DF.

01:53:52
<transcript>: As functionality.

01:53:55
laytanl_: It uses treesitter, which also does your highlighting

01:53:59
<transcript>: Is class outer. Okay, let's start using some of this and see what comes of it.

01:53:59
<transcript>: let's

01:54:02
<transcript>: Let's see what comes of.

01:54:05
<transcript>: This problem.

01:54:05
<transcript>: problem

01:54:07
<transcript>: field

01:54:07
<transcript>: Problem with our.

01:54:09
<transcript>: Field edition.

01:54:10
<transcript>: 15.

01:54:13
<transcript>: So.

01:54:13
rjayuu: Treesitter is its own AST, the whole design is orthogonal to LSP. I guess always intending to be used alongside

01:54:19
laytanl_: much lighter than lsp

01:54:20
<transcript>: We have a like a Syndax problem here. Something.

01:54:21
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:54:29
<transcript>: No full pound. Thanks for the follow Ex. Bernie.

01:54:32
<transcript>: Much lighter than LSP. Okay.

01:54:32
<transcript>: so tre

01:54:39
<transcript>: So Tree Sir is its own AST the whole design is orthogonal to LSP, I guess always intending to be used alongside interesting.

01:54:39
<transcript>: thank you so much

01:54:41
rjayuu: and works with multiple languages/markdowns out of the box

01:54:42
<transcript>: Thank you so much pascript for the follow.

01:54:42
<transcript>: it use

01:54:44
<transcript>: It uses.

01:54:44
<transcript>: which also does

01:54:48
<transcript>: Which also does your highlighting Yay okay.

01:54:58
<transcript>: Works with multiple languages. Markdowns right of the box. Okay, so I don't even have to, like, initially install LSP's to get this tree shooter stuff.

01:55:01
<transcript>: So something's wrong with my config? Here.

01:55:01
<transcript>: text

01:55:03
<transcript>: Text, objects.

01:55:05
<transcript>: Highlight.

01:55:09
rjayuu: Nope, just the treesitter grammars which are much more lightweight

01:55:13
<transcript>: Text, objects.

01:55:13
<transcript>: select

01:55:16
<transcript>: Select. And then after select, we have swap.

01:55:19
<transcript>: After swap we have move.

01:55:23
<transcript>: An LSP interact.

01:55:26
<transcript>: Okay, but some things wrong.

01:55:29
<transcript>: With all that stuff.

01:55:40
<transcript>: What do we think.

01:55:44
<transcript>: There's wrong with my config.

01:55:51
<transcript>: Objects.

01:55:55
<transcript>: I need to do anything else.

01:56:00
<transcript>: Inventory. Sitter configs.

01:56:00
<transcript>: requiring

01:56:03
<transcript>: Requiring that. And we're adding all this config.

01:56:14
<transcript>: You can install text subjects it takes up or use the default pack feature of Neal VM. Default Pack feature of Neovim. What is that.

01:56:20
<transcript>: There's a default. Do I not need Packer anymore? Did they incorporate it into neovem.

01:56:27
<transcript>: Do what's this? Invtree sitter.

01:56:29
<transcript>: Do TS update.

01:56:34
<transcript>: I'm not using them. Plug.

01:56:37
<transcript>: I.

01:56:47
<transcript>: Know what's wrong.

01:56:47
<transcript>: when i

01:56:55
<transcript>: When I try to save the file, this buffer. Oh, wait. Is it just working now? Oh, it's just working. Oh, when I tried to source it, yeah, Yeah.

01:56:55
<transcript>: error detect

01:57:00
<transcript>: Error detectoring Air detected while processing source.

01:57:06
<transcript>: Air executing Lua tree center query Invalid field the position 15.

01:57:08
<transcript>: Let's do this.

01:57:13
<transcript>: Go back to plugins.

01:57:17
<transcript>: Inside the side. I'm doing the latest.

01:57:21
<transcript>: Consider in the layer streets that are text objects instead of pinning them.

01:57:28
<transcript>: Why did we just update those eleven minutes ago? We literally just updated those eleven minutes ago. Wow.

01:57:28
<transcript>: we

01:57:31
<transcript>: We are getting the very latest.

01:57:31
<transcript>: like

01:57:32
<transcript>: Like.

01:57:32
<transcript>: very very

01:57:35
<transcript>: Very, very latest that is.

01:57:40
<transcript>: Not the UpToDate code right there.

01:57:48
<transcript>: So if I try and save it now is it doing the thing where it auto collapses, everything.

01:57:48
<transcript>: so

01:57:50
<transcript>: So source this thing.

01:57:50
<transcript>: no

01:57:52
<transcript>: No.

01:57:56
<transcript>: Actually, let's try. Just quitting.

01:57:56
<transcript>: in them because i

01:57:58
<transcript>: In them because I wonder if.

01:58:01
<transcript>: Something else wasn't sourced. Maybe.

01:58:04
<transcript>: Let's go.

01:58:04
<transcript>: here

01:58:05
<transcript>: Here.

01:58:05
<transcript>: pres

01:58:07
<transcript>: Presetter.

01:58:12
<transcript>: Okay. So I didn't get any errors when I opened in Vin. So that means.

01:58:17
<transcript>: It's good. Now I just had no source. Something else? There's a plugins file or something. I don't know.

01:58:17
<transcript>: but we should have it now

01:58:21
<transcript>: But we should have it now. We should have text object support. So let's go over here.

01:58:21
<transcript>: let's quit

01:58:24
<transcript>: Let's quit and reopen in them and our overlays project.

01:58:29
<transcript>: And let's see, let's see what I want to open.

01:58:33
nullchefo: blazingly latest primeagenHeyy

01:58:33
<transcript>: Index.

01:58:39
<transcript>: Nice default. So we're in here. We're gonna learn some text, objects, stuff.

01:58:49
<transcript>: Earlier I could delete a function with DAF.

01:58:57
<transcript>: Is that considered a function? It's a hook. Yeah, it's a function.

01:59:01
<transcript>: F. No. Okay, not deaf.

01:59:05
<transcript>: Blazingly latest. That's right in Old Chef. Oh.

01:59:05
rjayuu: Might need to install the typescript grammar

01:59:10
<transcript>: It's the blazingly latest code.

01:59:22
<transcript>: So DAFF, not it. What do we have here? Function outer. So these are the key maps you can use capture groups to file intext objects. So DAF should have deleted the outer function right.

01:59:26
<transcript>: I just do AF.

01:59:26
<transcript>: let's

01:59:29
<transcript>: Let's be in visual mode.

01:59:34
<transcript>: Oh, a cuz. Yeah, I can do that.

01:59:36
<transcript>: There you go into.

01:59:36
<transcript>: insert

01:59:38
<transcript>: Insert mode.

01:59:38
<transcript>: is it

01:59:40
<transcript>: Is It leader? Af.

01:59:40
<transcript>: these all

01:59:42
<transcript>: These all leader.

01:59:42
<transcript>: that lead

01:59:44
<transcript>: That leader, DAFF.

01:59:44
<transcript>: now

01:59:47
<transcript>: Now. Peter. Af. No.

01:59:47
<transcript>: okay

01:59:52
<transcript>: Okay. Someone helped me out here. Do I know? Maybe we just don't have it. It's not loaded.

01:59:55
<transcript>: Did I miss something in my config.

01:59:59
<transcript>: Selection modes.

02:00:02
<transcript>: Default. This car was the.

02:00:06
<transcript>: I gotta test this stuff I need to install the TypeScript grammar.

02:00:07
laytanl_: maybe it doesn't support these functions

02:00:08
<transcript>: Oh.

02:00:14
<transcript>: Like if I do LSBs different. It's different than text.

02:00:16
<transcript>: tree

02:00:16
<transcript>: Tree sitter.

02:00:17
taerser: daf within function?

02:00:17
<transcript>: Tree.

02:00:17
<transcript>: sitter

02:00:19
<transcript>: Sitter.

02:00:20
<transcript>: Tree.

02:00:22
laytanl_: it should work with 'daf'

02:00:28
<transcript>: What are the tree sitter commands? Is there like a tree setter status of TS? I think I've seen.

02:00:31
rjayuu: :TSInstall

02:00:33
<transcript>: Ts.

02:00:33
<transcript>: angel

02:00:35
<transcript>: Angel info.

02:00:37
mindtricks: whos that handsome devil?

02:00:41
<transcript>: Ts? Config info.

02:00:44
sondreal: how is the switch to VIM going?

02:00:44
<transcript>: No, don't want that.

02:00:48
<transcript>: Definitely not that. How do I get out of this.

02:00:48
<transcript>: what am i in

02:00:51
<transcript>: What am I in? Quit.

02:00:55
<transcript>: Let's try TS. Something else.

02:00:59
<transcript>: Module info.

02:01:01
<transcript>: Is this.

02:01:01
<transcript>: context

02:01:02
<transcript>: Context.

02:01:10
<transcript>: Those TypeScript added here.

02:01:13
rjayuu: :TSInstall typescript

02:01:13
<transcript>: i mean

02:01:13
<transcript>: Typescript.

02:01:16
<transcript>: oh

02:01:16
<transcript>: I mean it's added. I don't know.

02:01:17
<transcript>: Oh, here we go.

02:01:17
<transcript>: next object

02:01:19
<transcript>: Next objects.

02:01:23
<transcript>: Typescript.

02:01:28
<transcript>: I don't know if this is actually telling me anything.

02:01:30
<transcript>: What this is telling me.

02:01:33
<transcript>: I get out of it, though.

02:01:33
<transcript>: there's just a buffer

02:01:34
<transcript>: There's just a buffer.

02:01:38
<transcript>: That's just a buffer. I guess so.

02:01:43
<transcript>: Mine. Tricks. Welcome to Chat. Who's? That handsome devil? Are you talking about? Me.

02:01:46
<transcript>: Or somebody I pulled up on screen.

02:01:51
<transcript>: Feel like you're not talking. Have you seen my hair today? Look at this.

02:01:55
<transcript>: Am I the handsome devil you're referring to? I don't think so.

02:01:55
<transcript>: i don't think so

02:02:01
<transcript>: I don't think so. Tim might need to install types of grammar. Do we think so? Maybe it doesn't support these functions.

02:02:01
<transcript>: dap

02:02:06
<transcript>: Dap within function? Yeah. Teresa, this was trying. So I'm inside a function. Here.

02:02:06
<transcript>: daf

02:02:07
<transcript>: Daf.

02:02:09
<transcript>: And nothing.

02:02:21
<transcript>: I wonder if it's conflicting with bad hair day. Yeah, that's already. A bad hair day. Just got worse. I guess it should work with Beth TS install. Okay.

02:02:25
<transcript>: Install like that argument required.

02:02:30
stroopwafel26: chroma key?!

02:02:31
<transcript>: Argument required. How is the switch to Vimgoing? It's going all right, Sandriel, I'm loving it.

02:02:31
<transcript>: to install

02:02:34
<transcript>: To install touch script. Okay.

02:02:34
<transcript>: chrom

02:02:41
<transcript>: Chroma key? Yeah. The Chroma key gets really messed up on this bad hair day. Some of these Snap filters, they have, like, colorization going on.

02:02:41
<transcript>: with

02:02:44
taerser: i don't think it recognize hook as function

02:02:48
<transcript>: With like the background. So it just screws up the Chroma key. There's nothing I can do about it. Nothing I want to do about it.

02:02:48
<transcript>: yes

02:02:49
laytanl_: try with a 'function x()' syntax maybeü§î

02:02:50
<transcript>: Yes install.

02:02:56
<transcript>: After pressure already available. Would you like to reinstall? Sure. Why not.

02:03:00
<transcript>: Okay.

02:03:00
<transcript>: daff

02:03:01
<transcript>: Daff.

02:03:06
<transcript>: It's just not even what my mat, my key maths are set to or something.

02:03:09
<transcript>: Would that be select? Would that be move.

02:03:16
<transcript>: Are there logs I need to look at.

02:03:22
laytanl_: select

02:03:27
<transcript>: Optional set descriptions to the mappings is my config just not good.

02:03:27
<transcript>: try with

02:03:33
<transcript>: Try with the function X syntax. Oh, yeah, yeah. So maybe it doesn't handle these constant.

02:03:41
<transcript>: Let's try a function like this function.

02:03:41
<transcript>: yeah

02:03:43
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:03:43
<transcript>: right there

02:03:49
<transcript>: Right there. So here if I just, like, an inside this. And I do DAFF. Oh, yeah, that one worked.

02:03:54
<transcript>: But it leaves. So what does it do, though? It looks.

02:03:57
<transcript>: Leave. That why. Oh, that.

02:03:57
<transcript>: 's

02:04:00
<transcript>: 's the definition.

02:04:00
<transcript>: why can't

02:04:07
<transcript>: Why can't I fold that? My folding is kind of worthless. I can't ever fold things. I want to fold.

02:04:07
<transcript>: so

02:04:16
<transcript>: So there's a knit down here. So, yeah, it deletes. The whole thing definitely does. Daff it's gone. So it's just. I can't write functions like that anymore.

02:04:16
<transcript>: if i write

02:04:18
<transcript>: If I write them like.

02:04:18
<transcript>: this

02:04:21
<transcript>: This where they're like Lambda arrows.

02:04:21
<transcript>: like this

02:04:23
<transcript>: Like this, right.

02:04:27
<transcript>: On my.

02:04:34
<transcript>: Doesn't work.

02:04:34
<transcript>: do that

02:04:35
<transcript>: Do that.

02:04:35
<transcript>: here

02:04:41
rjayuu: You'll just have to learn treesitter, and update the plugin to handle hooks Kappa

02:04:45
<transcript>: Here. No, DAFF. It's deleting the function below. That's a little disheartening. So I'm in this function, right. And then I say, DAFF and deletes that function.

02:04:48
<transcript>: I expected.

02:04:48
<transcript>: just

02:04:52
<transcript>: Just have to learn treesitter and update the plug the plugin to handle hooks.

02:04:52
<transcript>: oh

02:04:55
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. Okay, we could update the plugins.

02:04:55
<transcript>: maybe

02:05:02
<transcript>: Maybe Late wants to do it. Hey, Leighton, while you're at making awesome knees and plugins, maybe you want to.

02:05:06
<transcript>: Update the TypeScript grammar and treats it or object.

02:05:09
<transcript>: objects or whatever

02:05:09
<transcript>: objects or whatever i don't know

02:05:12
<transcript>: Objects or whatever. I don't know what? We'd be updating. We'd be updating something.

02:05:15
<transcript>: the better it is

02:05:15
<transcript>: All right.

02:05:17
<transcript>: The better it is just too much for me.

02:05:17
<transcript>: but i do

02:05:19
laytanl_: that is what 'lookahead' does in your config

02:05:21
<transcript>: But I do feel cool when I wear these. So let's do that.

02:05:40
<transcript>: So look ahead does in your config. Oh, it is. Look ahead is true. Automatically jump forward to text objects similar to targets. Oh, so that's why it deleted that function, even though it wasn't in that function. Why would I want to do that, though I'm not in that function. While I believe just the next object.

02:05:46
<transcript>: I don't feel like I want that. But I want to see if that if I turn it off. Does that.

02:05:46
<transcript>: so

02:05:48
<transcript>: So F true.

02:05:51
<transcript>: See at this actually.

02:05:54
<transcript>: Is the case.

02:05:57
<transcript>: Did I make any changes I want to save? I don't think so.

02:05:59
<transcript>: Now.

02:06:07
stroopwafel26: gotta say, alacritty does feel snappy, I wonder what terminal I'll switch to next week

02:06:08
<transcript>: Let's now I'm inside this function. And I say.

02:06:08
<transcript>: deaf

02:06:11
<transcript>: someone can

02:06:11
<transcript>: Deaf. It doesn't delete. It cool.

02:06:20
<transcript>: Someone can tell me if that's just terrible. If turning off look ahead is the dumbest thing you've ever seen. Let me know otherwise. I think I don't want one. Go ahead. I don't think I want to delete things.

02:06:20
<transcript>: that are

02:06:23
<transcript>: That are next in line just for fun Zies.

02:06:30
<transcript>: Got to say Alacrity does feel snappy. I wonder what terminal is, what's to next week.

02:06:40
<transcript>: Okay. So I'm seeing now that some of the defaults are not.

02:06:44
<transcript>: Like this is configuring this to be not the default.

02:06:53
<transcript>: Succeeding Whites. This is Priority Owners Act. Similarly to example builtin AP. Okay, so let's learn some more of this stuff. Let's.

02:06:57
<transcript>: That was the lead a function.

02:06:57
<transcript>: we can also

02:07:05
<transcript>: We can also, I guess Yanka function. So I'm inside this function. If I do YF oh, don't do, don't add an s.

02:07:10
laytanl_: might help changing '@function.outer' to '@block.outer'

02:07:15
<transcript>: Yeah, cool. Yank. That function feels good. It feels bad that I'm gonna have to write functions this very specific way that can't handle the arrow.

02:07:15
<transcript>: syntax

02:07:16
<transcript>: function

02:07:16
<transcript>: Syntax.

02:07:19
laytanl_: that might work with hooks

02:07:20
<transcript>: Function Adder to block Adder. Oh, okay.

02:07:20
<transcript>: so

02:07:22
<transcript>: So you think that might.

02:07:22
<transcript>: that might

02:07:27
<transcript>: That might work with hooks? Let's try it late, let's try it.

02:07:30
<transcript>: Block, outer.

02:07:35
<transcript>: Inside would be blocked inner if we did that, I guess.

02:07:39
<transcript>: I don't want to get ahead of myself, but also, I guess I just did so.

02:07:39
<transcript>: didn't

02:07:43
<transcript>: Didn't want to not get ahead of myself that badly, I guess.

02:07:43
<transcript>: let's sort

02:07:44
<transcript>: Let's sort.

02:07:44
<transcript>: of need

02:07:48
<transcript>: Of need to source it. I'm doing it over here. Right.

02:07:50
<transcript>: In vim.

02:07:50
<transcript>: we're gonna take

02:07:55
<transcript>: We're gonna take a break here shortly, and I'm gonna get my Dandy blend.

02:07:59
<transcript>: River TS. I guess I'm gonna start eating up some water.

02:08:03
<transcript>: Really need a button on my stream deck to eat up water.

02:08:03
<transcript>: that'd be great

02:08:04
<transcript>: That'd be great.

02:08:14
<transcript>: Alright.

02:08:21
<transcript>: Water is heating. We're gonna see.

02:08:21
<transcript>: if this

02:08:29
<transcript>: If this works with this thing now I delete that function. It does work to delete the contents of the function. I guess.

02:08:33
<transcript>: So DAFF deleted.

02:08:35
stroopwafel26: what internet enabled hot water thing do you have?

02:08:37
<transcript>: This block. The try block. If I'm on here and I do it.

02:08:41
<transcript>: I go here, and I do it.

02:08:41
<transcript>: half

02:08:42
<transcript>: Half.

02:08:42
<transcript>: ooh

02:08:44
<transcript>: Ooh, I don't know what it did.

02:08:48
<transcript>: Or block.

02:09:00
<transcript>: What about what was the inner diff.

02:09:04
laytanl_: yeah block is more general

02:09:06
<transcript>: So this is supposed to delete the insides of a function. Yeah.

02:09:06
<transcript>: did

02:09:08
<transcript>: Did okay.

02:09:11
laytanl_: might not be ideal

02:09:15
<transcript>: I think we're gonna go back.

02:09:15
<transcript>: to

02:09:17
<transcript>: To function instead of block.

02:09:19
<transcript>: Think that's.

02:09:23
<transcript>: More what we're looking for, right.

02:09:27
<transcript>: We just need to start writing.

02:09:27
<transcript>: i mean for

02:09:35
<transcript>: I mean for hooks. I just don't know. There's just not probably hope for hooks unless we make changes to tree center text objects. Is there a real.

02:09:39
<transcript>: React grammar.

02:09:39
<transcript>: i could check

02:09:43
<transcript>: I could check. Not gonna check. Right the second, though.

02:09:45
<transcript>: And then like that.

02:10:01
<transcript>: So we're back to DAFF doesn't work in functions that are fine with an arrow like that. It does work in these. I think I just need to start writing my functions like this. It's probably better to just not mix and match like I do.

02:10:03
<transcript>: Anyway.

02:10:03
<transcript>: so

02:10:07
<transcript>: So for instance, if I wanted to change this one.

02:10:08
<transcript>: I would do.

02:10:11
<transcript>: Async function.

02:10:15
<transcript>: And then I would remove that.

02:10:15
<transcript>: i would

02:10:16
<transcript>: really

02:10:16
<transcript>: I would.

02:10:19
<transcript>: Really that word. I would.

02:10:26
<transcript>: Like this.

02:10:41
laytanl_: if you scroll down the readme you see the captures that are available, there might be something that matches arrow functions too

02:10:42
rjayuu: A quick google suggests the base 'javascript' grammar should cover react, but I assume you have that installed already

02:10:45
<transcript>: And then I would need to type these.

02:10:50
<transcript>: Custom Requests list.

02:10:58
<transcript>: Js request or something. What is it? Next request.

02:11:00
<transcript>: How it is.

02:11:03
<transcript>: Think.

02:11:03
<transcript>: and then this would

02:11:05
<transcript>: And then this would be a.

02:11:05
<transcript>: next

02:11:06
<transcript>: Next response.

02:11:06
<transcript>: it's like

02:11:08
<transcript>: It's like that.

02:11:11
<transcript>: I think that's what Custom server.

02:11:11
<transcript>: or customer

02:11:13
<transcript>: Or Customer Request listener.

02:11:15
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:11:19
<transcript>: This one.

02:11:27
<transcript>: Yeah, incoming message. I was off incoming message and custom server response, so I was in close.

02:11:29
<transcript>: Okay.

02:11:35
<transcript>: Why don't I just save that for I'm gonna go back.

02:11:35
<transcript>: so

02:11:37
<transcript>: incoming

02:11:37
<transcript>: So this would be.

02:11:38
<transcript>: Incoming message.

02:11:44
<transcript>: And then I get it.

02:11:44
<transcript>: get it

02:11:51
<transcript>: Get it. Yeah. And then this would be a what did I say? Custom server response or something.

02:11:54
<transcript>: Custom.

02:11:54
<transcript>: server

02:11:57
<transcript>: Server response? Yeah. Okay.

02:11:57
<transcript>: so that would

02:11:59
<transcript>: So that would work right.

02:12:03
<transcript>: Conversion. Five.

02:12:09
<transcript>: Incompatible type server response is not comparable to Type custom server response.

02:12:13
<transcript>: That so oh as request listener.

02:12:16
<transcript>: That is no longer.

02:12:23
<transcript>: You're saying you can't convert that to request online.

02:12:23
<transcript>: where am i

02:12:24
<transcript>: Where am I.

02:12:29
<transcript>: Sometimes I just panic in them. Let me start. Like smashing keys.

02:12:32
<transcript>: Block is more general.

02:12:42
<transcript>: Strip. It's my. It's my fridge. My fridge has hot water. And it has, like, smart phones, whatever. Connectivity.

02:12:50
<transcript>: Block is more generally might not be ideal if you scroll down the README, you see the captures that are available. There might be something that matches Aero functions to oh, maybe.

02:12:50
<transcript>: quick google

02:12:57
<transcript>: Quick, Google suggests the base JavaScript grammar should cover react, but assume you have that installed already. Yeah, I think we've got JavaScript. I wonder.

02:12:57
<transcript>: if there's

02:12:59
<transcript>: If there's a capture here, let's see.

02:13:01
stroopwafel26: a fridge with a hot water function? you're living in the future

02:13:04
<transcript>: Frame function loop parameter scope name statement.

02:13:06
<transcript>: Call.

02:13:06
<transcript>: lock

02:13:10
<transcript>: Lock attribute. Okay. Interesting. We could play with those.

02:13:13
<transcript>: Parameterscope, name statements.

02:13:17
<transcript>: So I'm just. I'm changing this function to be.

02:13:22
<transcript>: This listener to be an actual I guess I needed to find the response.

02:13:22
<transcript>: what does that

02:13:24
<transcript>: What does that thing respond.

02:13:26
<transcript>: To.

02:13:28
<transcript>: It's here.

02:13:28
<transcript>: it returns

02:13:30
<transcript>: It returns. Void. Okay.

02:13:32
<transcript>: Custom Server response.

02:13:32
<transcript>: is

02:13:36
<transcript>: Is a server response plus it has a server.

02:13:36
<transcript>: so why

02:13:37
<transcript>: So why.

02:13:39
<transcript>: I can't.

02:13:44
<transcript>: telling me is i'm

02:13:44
<transcript>: This listener.

02:13:54
<transcript>: Telling me is I'm too different conversion types incoming message types of parameters or sponsors Incomatible. Type server response is not comparable to type custom server response.

02:14:01
<transcript>: Yeah. I mean, yeah, I guess whatever.

02:14:03
<transcript>: As unknown.

02:14:08
<transcript>: Do you think sometimes I say whatever TypeScript, whatever.

02:14:11
<transcript>: or

02:14:11
<transcript>: The Trust me.

02:14:13
<transcript>: Or work.

02:14:17
<transcript>: As Customs server.

02:14:20
<transcript>: Okay.

02:14:20
<transcript>: guess i could

02:14:23
<transcript>: Guess I could make it optional. No, that would work.

02:14:28
<transcript>: To our.

02:14:40
<transcript>: Let's go to request listener wait a minute wait a minute.

02:14:42
<transcript>: Wait a minute.

02:14:47
<transcript>: Custom listener, did I remove it up here? Custom Request listener.

02:14:51
<transcript>: As your quest listener.

02:14:57
<transcript>: Okay. So we're importing information.

02:15:03
<transcript>: In order to say it's a request listener. I think what I need to do is.

02:15:12
<transcript>: I need to go here and say that's optional. Maybe I'm just gonna break so many things. I just want to see if it fixes this thing, though.

02:15:12
<transcript>: we fix that so

02:15:13
<transcript>: We fix that. So.

02:15:15
<transcript>: If it's optional.

02:15:20
<transcript>: It's optional? It works? But we're gonna break so many things.

02:15:20
<transcript>: i think

02:15:21
<transcript>: I think.

02:15:21
<transcript>: basically

02:15:24
<transcript>: Basically all these things, right.

02:15:26
<transcript>: server

02:15:26
<transcript>: Lib.

02:15:28
<transcript>: Server TS.

02:15:30
<transcript>: Lib.

02:15:30
<transcript>: like ob

02:15:33
<transcript>: Like OBS or something. Something that takes in.

02:15:33
<transcript>: the server

02:15:35
<transcript>: The server and expects.

02:15:35
<transcript>: even better

02:15:38
<transcript>: Even better in the API route.

02:15:42
<transcript>: And here like.

02:15:42
<transcript>: these expect

02:15:43
<transcript>: These expect.

02:15:55
<transcript>: I'm looking for server.

02:15:59
<transcript>: There we go.

02:15:59
<transcript>: oh so

02:16:02
<transcript>: Oh, so it's not even though it's optional now.

02:16:05
<transcript>: Server.

02:16:05
<transcript>: even though that

02:16:09
<transcript>: Even though that's optional. Is it not throwing? It's not upset about this.

02:16:17
<transcript>: Here.

02:16:24
<transcript>: So go back if I'm going to go back to S, I say.

02:16:30
<transcript>: Like that. Yeah. Okay.

02:16:30
<transcript>: custom server

02:16:31
<transcript>: Custom server.

02:16:31
<transcript>: you're tell

02:16:33
<transcript>: You're telling me.

02:16:36
<transcript>: Wait a minute.

02:16:40
<transcript>: Custom Server the listener.

02:16:43
<transcript>: Did I not break everything? I thought I was gonna break everything.

02:16:52
<transcript>: By saying that on the listener, it's optional. I guess not. Okay, but I'd have to handle all the what if it's undefined cases.

02:16:52
<transcript>: fairly not

02:16:58
<transcript>: now

02:16:58
<transcript>: Fairly not. We're good. So this is how I would do it. I would make this function look like this instead.

02:17:00
<transcript>: i can delete

02:17:00
<transcript>: Now.

02:17:01
<transcript>: i want to delete it

02:17:01
<transcript>: I can delete it.

02:17:03
<transcript>: I want to delete it, but I could.

02:17:03
<transcript>: okay

02:17:05
<transcript>: Okay. Let's clean up.

02:17:07
<transcript>: Let's clean out.

02:17:12
<transcript>: everybody

02:17:12
<transcript>: Let's clean up, clean up.

02:17:17
<transcript>: Everybody do your shit. That's the song we sing when my kids make a mess and we have to clean up.

02:17:30
<transcript>: Okay, scroll down the remain so we check that quick Google statistry. Okay. Fridge with hot water function. You're living in the future. You bet I am. Let's take quick break and we come back. We're gonna learn some more text objects.

02:17:30
<transcript>: there's some more

02:17:35
<transcript>: There's some more to learn here. I've not done. I've just scratched the surface. Really.

02:17:38
stroopwafel26: I'm gonna take my daughter to the library

02:17:38
<transcript>: Just scrapched it.

02:17:38
<transcript>: like

02:17:41
<transcript>: leader

02:17:41
<transcript>: Like, what is the leader? Df. Do.

02:17:44
stroopwafel26: was nice hanging out, have a good day :)

02:17:55
<transcript>: Leader DF I guess I have to be honest if I'm on this function and I say Leader DF now what is it for peak definition code show text object surrounding definition is determined using the events built in LSB floating window.

02:17:59
<transcript>: Okay. Does that network function? Outer Oops.

02:18:02
<transcript>: So if I say later DF no.

02:18:10
<transcript>: That's our.

02:18:16
<transcript>: Leader.

02:18:16
<transcript>: lead

02:18:18
<transcript>: Leader.

02:18:21
<transcript>: Why do I keep hitting? R.

02:18:23
<transcript>: rid

02:18:26
<transcript>: Rid when I hit our but okay.

02:18:26
<transcript>: leader

02:18:27
<transcript>: Leader.

02:18:31
<transcript>: E Capital F okay doesn't do anything good to know.

02:18:31
<transcript>: i don't know what

02:18:33
<transcript>: I don't know what those are supposed to do.

02:18:44
<transcript>: We're gonna learn, we're gonna learn. So moving, I can move to the next function. So if I'm in this function here and I say.

02:18:47
<transcript>: Open Bracket M.

02:18:49
<transcript>: You go to what.

02:18:52
<transcript>: Function, outer.

02:18:59
<transcript>: Go to next end. Go to next start. Go to previous start. Go to previous end.

02:19:01
<transcript>: Okay.

02:19:01
<transcript>: what

02:19:03
<transcript>: What about two of those.

02:19:07
<transcript>: File.

02:19:07
<transcript>: why

02:19:08
<transcript>: why did it do that

02:19:08
<transcript>: Why.

02:19:13
<transcript>: Why did it do that? Okay. We're gonna learn all of this and more.

02:19:32
schrew: them SHORTS!

02:19:47
schrew: go off king?

02:20:13
laytanl_: Here is an issue regarding the arrow functions: https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects/issues/215

02:20:22
laytanl_: seems like it broke in a recent change

02:20:39
laytanl_: @function.inner does work though

02:30:47
<transcript>: See a Stroop. Sorry, Miss. That before I left.

02:30:53
<transcript>: Seems like it broken, right. Okay. Here's an issue requiring.

02:30:59
<transcript>: function

02:30:59
<transcript>: Regarding the Aero functions. Oh, nice like it broken around a recent change. Inner does work, though. Okay.

02:31:03
<transcript>: Function inner does work. So if I do.

02:31:03
<transcript>: diw

02:31:04
<transcript>: Diw.

02:31:07
<transcript>: Or not. W Di F.

02:31:07
<transcript>: thanks so

02:31:10
<transcript>: Thanks so much for the follow a 13.

02:31:14
<transcript>: I appreciate that. Thank you. Followed me while I was on a break.

02:31:14
<transcript>: that's fine

02:31:16
<transcript>: That's fine.

02:31:21
<transcript>: Just have to see it when I come back so I can thank you.

02:31:25
<transcript>: Let's try the function inter thing.

02:31:27
<transcript>: So this is a thing they're aware of.

02:31:27
<transcript>: that

02:31:29
<transcript>: That.

02:31:33
schrew: two in a row, oh baby

02:31:40
<transcript>: Oh, did it do it twice? No, it just use shoes. Twice in a row. Thanks. Cube is for the follow. Two in a row. Look at you. Shrew should head to Vegas.

02:31:50
<transcript>: I'm luck on your side. So if we want to delete the inside of a function so I'm inside of an arrow function. Well, I'm not in more. Let's go to.

02:31:50
<transcript>: index

02:31:52
<transcript>: Index.

02:31:56
schrew: don't tempt me, adam, because I will go to vegas

02:31:56
<transcript>: Here. And here. I'm inside of a function. If I do.

02:31:56
<transcript>: di

02:31:58
<transcript>: Di F.

02:32:06
<transcript>: It deletes inside the entire error function. It doesn't believe inside the hook.

02:32:06
<transcript>: like here

02:32:07
<transcript>: Like here.

02:32:13
<transcript>: Interesting. So like this is a function. This async right here. This is a function.

02:32:16
<transcript>: Very small function. But it does something.

02:32:16
<transcript>: doesn't

02:32:28
<transcript>: Doesn't delete inside of that. So if I instead deleting, let's. Oh, so interesting. Yank works. Yank inside the function. Works. But delete inside the function. Oh, it worked that time.

02:32:30
<transcript>: So dependent on where I was.

02:32:39
<transcript>: Interesting. Did I just. I'm inside there. It deletes everything inside of home.

02:32:39
<transcript>: how about

02:32:41
<transcript>: How about right.

02:32:41
<transcript>: here

02:32:45
<transcript>: Here. This isn't really inside a function, though. This inside an object.

02:32:51
<transcript>: Yeah, so.

02:32:54
<transcript>: On a delete inside.

02:32:59
<transcript>: Let's see, swap, Select.

02:33:02
<transcript>: Function, outer.

02:33:02
<transcript>: function

02:33:03
<transcript>: Function, inner.

02:33:03
<transcript>: class

02:33:05
<transcript>: Class outer.

02:33:05
<transcript>: what's

02:33:09
<transcript>: What's? The class? There is no class. Here, is there.

02:33:17
<transcript>: Optionally set descriptions to the mappings using the description parameter of MVM buff set key map.

02:33:17
<transcript>: inner part of

02:33:19
<transcript>: Inner part of a class region.

02:33:22
<transcript>: i'm not

02:33:22
<transcript>: Okay.

02:33:25
<transcript>: I'm not gonna send any descriptions.

02:33:27
<transcript>: So I don't need to worry about that.

02:33:34
<transcript>: So these are only three. I have configured right now and then selection modes. We've got outer.

02:33:34
<transcript>: powder

02:33:36
<transcript>: on it

02:33:36
<transcript>: Powder.

02:33:37
<transcript>: On it.

02:33:41
<transcript>: I'm not sure I'm understanding all this.

02:33:44
<transcript>: Don't hit me.

02:33:48
<transcript>: Okay.

02:33:48
<transcript>: so i'm gonna

02:33:52
<transcript>: So I'm gonna open this issue. Actually, laden want to see.

02:33:55
<transcript>: layton

02:33:55
<transcript>: What to see.

02:33:57
<transcript>: Layton, are you.

02:33:59
<transcript>: Excited.

02:33:59
<transcript>: there's

02:34:02
<transcript>: There's gonna be there's gonna be some tie.

02:34:02
<transcript>: pr

02:34:11
<transcript>: Pr creating for Cloak. Did you see that on Twitter? It's gonna create a PR. It is life. I think they just had a baby, like in labor yesterday.

02:34:11
<transcript>: so

02:34:27
laytanl_: Cool!

02:34:28
<transcript>: So probably not today. But soon there'll be a tea stream. I may or may not join, but basically I will join if you let me. He mentioned Colab. So we'll see. We'll see. I know nothing about writing, Lua. I know enough.

02:34:28
<transcript>: to edit

02:34:38
<transcript>: To edit these files when I have to based on readmese, but it would be fun to join just to join T doing cool things that he will surely do.

02:34:42
<transcript>: So he mentioned some things he'd like to submit a PR for.

02:34:45
<transcript>: Cool. Yeah.

02:34:48
<transcript>: Michael, thanks for the follow. I appreciate that.

02:34:57
<transcript>: Move commands not working with error function.

02:35:01
<transcript>: So this is from May 28.

02:35:08
<transcript>: Just six explain why function InterWorks for me, but not about function. I only works for function decorations and no expressions.

02:35:08
<transcript>: reverting

02:35:12
<transcript>: Reverting to a commit before fixes what you mentioned, so yes. Okay.

02:35:17
<transcript>: So maybe we want to fix this. Maybe.

02:35:20
<transcript>: Right here, on screen. Maybe we want to do it.

02:35:20
<transcript>: you want to learn

02:35:23
<transcript>: You want to learn from Loua? Try and fix this.

02:35:32
<transcript>: Sure you're on the latest Commission of this repo. Copy this just on your local and open it. Place the cursor on the first line. Try to move down using keys.

02:35:32
<transcript>: go

02:35:34
<transcript>: Go to next start.

02:35:38
laytanl_: This is actually not lua though haha

02:35:39
<transcript>: We don't want to do that I don't know anything about.

02:35:39
<transcript>: maybe you do

02:35:46
laytanl_: It is treesitter query language

02:35:46
<transcript>: Maybe you do late, and maybe you want to have to not try to brush you. But you know things about Loua.

02:35:50
<transcript>: I do not.

02:35:51
laytanl_: like lisp

02:35:57
<transcript>: But that's cool school in your IDE is a thing you can poke around on and make changes to in this way.

02:36:01
<transcript>: Okay. So we know how to do.

02:36:04
<transcript>: Surround. Now we know how to work with surround.

02:36:04
<transcript>: ysd

02:36:07
<transcript>: Ysds, and CS.

02:36:07
<transcript>: still not

02:36:10
<transcript>: Still not second nature, but we'll get there.

02:36:10
<transcript>: it's very handy

02:36:11
<transcript>: It's very handy.

02:36:13
<transcript>: We're still kind of learning.

02:36:22
<transcript>: Tree center text objects. I don't feel like I have a I feel like I'm missing some, like have other people make more key maps.

02:36:22
<transcript>: i

02:36:26
<transcript>: I wonder. Like, Is this a Neph? Do I want more things.

02:36:26
<transcript>: so

02:36:28
<transcript>: So AF.

02:36:28
<transcript>: if

02:36:29
<transcript>: If.

02:36:29
<transcript>: ac

02:36:30
<transcript>: Ac.

02:36:35
<transcript>: Why not class inner. Why don't I see you know oh, they do have earlier.

02:36:40
<transcript>: I don't want to optionally this fine description.

02:36:40
<transcript>: i want this

02:36:46
<transcript>: I want this to look nice, so I'm gonna say, this is Oops.

02:36:52
<transcript>: I'm gonna say, this is I see, and this is inner, and I'm gonna delete.

02:36:52
<transcript>: all that

02:36:58
<transcript>: All that. Okay. So I feel like I should create some more of these, like, function class.

02:36:58
<transcript>: what other

02:37:00
<transcript>: What other ones are there.

02:37:05
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow expire.

02:37:05
<transcript>: xfire

02:37:07
<transcript>: Xfire slay.

02:37:15
<transcript>: See where are those here there so frame class call block attribute.

02:37:19
<transcript>: Attribute parameter loop. Oh, that'd be kind of cool.

02:37:19
<transcript>: like

02:37:21
<transcript>: so let's just

02:37:21
<transcript>: Like inside the loop.

02:37:25
<transcript>: So let's just say we wanted to define that we would say.

02:37:27
<transcript>: Like.

02:37:30
<transcript>: Al.

02:37:33
<transcript>: Maybe.

02:37:33
<transcript>: equal

02:37:34
<transcript>: Equal.

02:37:34
<transcript>: at

02:37:35
<transcript>: At loop.

02:37:39
<transcript>: Why do I do.

02:37:39
<transcript>: a would be

02:37:40
<transcript>: A would be outer.

02:37:42
<transcript>: Then.

02:37:49
<transcript>: Let's do like that. And we'll say.

02:37:52
<transcript>: I.

02:37:59
<transcript>: 'll Try that.

02:38:04
<transcript>: Here.

02:38:10
<transcript>: Hey, thanks to the follow one to Rabbit. I appreciate that. Cool. This is actually not Lua, though.

02:38:14
<transcript>: It's tree set or query language like List. Interesting.

02:38:14
<transcript>: okay

02:38:21
<transcript>: Okay. Good to know. Didn't know that. So let's say we wanted to test out our what did I just do? I did.

02:38:25
<transcript>: so many things

02:38:25
<transcript>: A conditional inner comment. Outer.

02:38:31
<transcript>: So many things to play with here. So we just did lose. So let's say, where do I have a loop.

02:38:33
<transcript>: In server TS.

02:38:42
<transcript>: Where do I have a loop? I think I have one somewhere.

02:38:42
<transcript>: i guess i could just

02:38:43
<transcript>: I guess I could just search.

02:38:43
<transcript>: for

02:38:44
<transcript>: For.

02:38:50
<transcript>: Oh, there we go. Four. Comps.

02:38:50
<transcript>: i'd have to

02:38:55
<transcript>: I'd have to escape the print. That's what was wrong there. Okay, so I'm inside a loop. Right here.

02:38:55
<transcript>: and

02:39:03
<transcript>: And I want to now I'm gonna select really just delete inside the loop? So I do D il.

02:39:06
<transcript>: Feels good.

02:39:06
<transcript>: it actually

02:39:10
<transcript>: It actually deleted the brackets, too, which is a little surprising.

02:39:17
<transcript>: The Al would delete the whole loop. Look at that. Delete that loop down. Okay.

02:39:17
<transcript>: feels good

02:39:20
<transcript>: Feels good, feels good.

02:39:20
<transcript>: i finally

02:39:23
<transcript>: I finally inside Parins. I guess I just do.

02:39:29
<transcript>: Like that. I don't need text objects for that, right.

02:39:38
<transcript>: What are the things that are hard to delete things? I wouldn't know how to delete.

02:39:42
<transcript>: what was

02:39:42
<transcript>: Or Yank, I guess.

02:39:47
<transcript>: What was the outer was the whole thing. So delete.

02:39:47
<transcript>: that

02:39:49
<transcript>: That whole loop. Please enter.

02:39:55
<transcript>: Delete inner does what it deletes.

02:39:55
<transcript>: everything

02:40:00
<transcript>: Everything includes the brackets. It'd be nice if it just deleted.

02:40:00
<transcript>: not including

02:40:05
<transcript>: like

02:40:05
<transcript>: Not including the brackets. And then I could just delete all the contents in here.

02:40:09
<transcript>: Like Yank. You know, Yank. I would expect.

02:40:09
<transcript>: it's not big

02:40:12
<transcript>: It's not bigger. How often I do any of this stuff actually.

02:40:21
<transcript>: Okay. So that's loops. What about conditionals? What would be a case where I'd want to do a condition. So like if and if block.

02:40:24
<transcript>: If the thing.

02:40:24
<transcript>: here

02:40:25
<transcript>: Here.

02:40:28
<transcript>: I don't like that one.

02:40:30
<transcript>: If.

02:40:33
<transcript>: Like any of those.

02:40:35
<transcript>: If.

02:40:43
<transcript>: I want just to straight return. I want something that has, like a body. You know, I'm saying.

02:40:46
<transcript>: That they have a body.

02:40:54
<transcript>: Yeah, like this one looks complicated. So I'm inside this big F statement. And if I wanted to say conditional.

02:40:59
<transcript>: I ever want to do that. Whatever I want to say. Like, yeah, maybe I might want to delete everything inside of this.

02:41:01
<transcript>: Right.

02:41:01
<transcript>: everything

02:41:04
<transcript>: Everything in here. I want to delete all that quickly.

02:41:17
<transcript>: So I would create another one of these. Unless there's just a way to do that already. Am I just creating stuff that I can already do and just straight them? I don't want to do that. Like how I could just delete inside the Prince. I already know how to do that.

02:41:17
<transcript>: i don't

02:41:20
<transcript>: I don't want to reinvent anything.

02:41:20
<transcript>: let

02:41:25
<transcript>: Let's create it. Let's create this would be inside conditionals. So I guess we'll do.

02:41:31
<transcript>: Your class. I feel like I'm never gonna do that. I don't write classes. Let's just do that. Let's update.

02:41:34
<transcript>: These to be conditional.

02:41:36
<transcript>: Right.

02:41:41
<transcript>: Additional.

02:41:43
<transcript>: Right.

02:41:43
<transcript>: i don't think i need

02:41:50
<transcript>: I don't think I need the class thing. I don't write classes. I guess I did in this project. As I say that.

02:41:53
<transcript>: So let's do invent.

02:41:53
<transcript>: inventory

02:41:54
<transcript>: Inventory.

02:41:59
<transcript>: Here we are.

02:42:01
<transcript>: If.

02:42:10
<transcript>: So I want to select. Let's just delete everything in it. Delete.

02:42:14
<transcript>: In conditional did not work.

02:42:17
<transcript>: delete

02:42:17
<transcript>: Did it.

02:42:18
<transcript>: all

02:42:18
<transcript>: Delete.

02:42:22
<transcript>: All. Okay. What does that delete that deleted.

02:42:26
<transcript>: It didn't leave inside the conditional. I wonder why.

02:42:28
<transcript>: Yank inside the conditional.

02:42:32
<transcript>: Outside the conditional. Okay, that got the whole thing.

02:42:36
<transcript>: I'm in here and I suit and I do delete all.

02:42:36
<transcript>: at least

02:42:38
<transcript>: At least that last else though.

02:42:38
<transcript>: this is

02:42:44
<transcript>: This is a pretty weird one. Oh, it's like nested. And so many ways. Look at this. We have this outer one.

02:42:49
<transcript>: Here. This is bad. I just should write code like this. That's problem.

02:42:56
<transcript>: Find another if.

02:42:56
<transcript>: to

02:43:02
<transcript>: To elf. I think that's more telling. Yeah. Here we go. So as simple, if you will. So delete.

02:43:02
<transcript>: in conditional

02:43:04
<transcript>: believing

02:43:04
<transcript>: In conditional. Nope.

02:43:09
<transcript>: Believing conditional. I worked in the Elf. Why did it not work in the if.

02:43:10
seafilmz: Hello. how are you doing? I am doing great.

02:43:13
<transcript>: Conditional is that another.

02:43:16
<transcript>: Hasty Films. I'm doing this.

02:43:16
<transcript>: you're doing great

02:43:25
<transcript>: You're doing great. I like that. You just kind of like, told me how you're doing. So I didn't need to ask you. You just kinda led with how you doing. I'm great. Just so you know.

02:43:29
<transcript>: That was nice.

02:43:32
mvd_dev: no neovim setup is complete without this keyboard https://www.charachorder.com/products/charachorder-one

02:43:36
<transcript>: For the following curleos. I really appreciate your follows. I hope that means you'll be back.

02:43:36
<transcript>: we'll be back to han

02:43:38
<transcript>: We'll be back to hang out.

02:43:38
<transcript>: into

02:43:40
<transcript>: Into its chat.

02:43:44
<transcript>: So why didn't this work? Anyone have any ideas.

02:43:44
<transcript>: back

02:43:45
<transcript>: Back.

02:43:45
<transcript>: beliefs

02:43:46
kreleos: tj has some cool things in his config, like swapping functions and parameters, incremental selection, etc. Maybe check it out for ideas

02:43:49
<transcript>: Beliefs, the whole conditional. It's not very useful, though.

02:43:51
<transcript>: Well, I guess I guess it is.

02:43:56
<transcript>: More likely. I'd want to delete everything inside of a condition.

02:43:57
cboorg: i love hanging out in here while working <3

02:43:58
<transcript>: At.

02:44:05
<transcript>: so that feels

02:44:05
<transcript>: That is what I expected, but still kind of not because it deletes the Prince or the brackets.

02:44:07
<transcript>: So that feels bad.

02:44:11
<transcript>: Because it kind of leaves me in a broken state, you know.

02:44:14
<transcript>: Although, Why isn't it working there.

02:44:14
<transcript>: 's like

02:44:18
<transcript>: 's like there's some bugs here or I'm misunderstanding some things.

02:44:24
<transcript>: Maybe I'll just write bad JavaScript. Maybe that's a problem. I just write bad JavaScript and it doesn't know what to do.

02:44:24
<transcript>: they're built in

02:44:27
<transcript>: They're built in grammar, doesn't and sorted it out.

02:44:36
<transcript>: Okay. If I wanted to, I'm just gonna practice some of my surround stuff again. I wanted to sort this in a new conditional. I would say.

02:44:39
<transcript>: Cs.

02:44:42
<transcript>: What.

02:44:45
<transcript>: Cs.

02:44:50
<transcript>: Not like this.

02:44:55
<transcript>: One why did I forget everything about invent surround.

02:44:59
<transcript>: Ysi I.

02:44:59
<transcript>: for

02:45:08
<transcript>: For inside. Oh, I was doing CS, but I want Y. So here. I want to add one with YSI. So.

02:45:08
<transcript>: y

02:45:10
<transcript>: Y? S.

02:45:19
<transcript>: Why don't I forget surround YSI.

02:45:21
<transcript>: W.

02:45:21
<transcript>: what was the w

02:45:28
<transcript>: What was the W for word? So let's be switched around the word, but I want to share on the whole line. So YS pound.

02:45:30
<transcript>: Yeah like that.

02:45:30
<transcript>: and

02:45:32
<transcript>: And I would be like, if.

02:45:32
<transcript>: yeah

02:45:34
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

02:45:39
<transcript>: Gotta get better gotta get better and faster.

02:45:44
<transcript>: Delete, and then replace.

02:45:47
<transcript>: Okay. We'll just let that come up naturally.

02:45:51
<transcript>: So the tree setter thing. I don't know. I just. I don't know.

02:45:55
<transcript>: If I'm feeling all the text, objects.

02:46:00
<transcript>: Or just that I'm running into some bugs.

02:46:03
<transcript>: So go to previous.

02:46:09
<transcript>: Swap. So if I want to swap function parameters, that's a common thing.

02:46:09
<transcript>: so

02:46:15
<transcript>: So I've got, like an order of well, that wouldn't but that would just change it in the text file. It wouldn't actually.

02:46:15
<transcript>: refact

02:46:20
<transcript>: Refactor it in like the collars of that function would have to be updated as well. Right.

02:46:33
<transcript>: So I'd rather have something built into the LSP for that, like something that could genuinely like when I do a rename, and it updates, like five buffers. That's what I want for things like reordering.

02:46:36
<transcript>: Okay.

02:46:36
<transcript>: i think that's

02:46:42
<transcript>: I think that's enough. I think we've done enough with text objects. Let's.

02:46:45
<transcript>: See.

02:46:55
<transcript>: Kelly O's. Teach has some cool things in his config, like swapping functions and parameters, incremental, selection, et cetera. Maybe change out his Fridays. That's a good idea.

02:46:55
<transcript>: we could look at

02:46:57
<transcript>: We could look at TG file.

02:46:57
<transcript>: mvd

02:47:04
<transcript>: Mvd welcome to Chat. I appreciate you joining us in Chats. No D of M setup is complete without this keyboard.

02:47:09
<transcript>: Another keyboard. We've opened so many keyboard tabs.

02:47:09
<transcript>: on this

02:47:13
<transcript>: On this very stream. What is that? That's a keyboard.

02:47:16
<transcript>: What.

02:47:19
<transcript>: You tell me that's a keyboard.

02:47:21
mvd_dev: lol, watch the video

02:47:21
<transcript>: Caricorder one.

02:47:27
<transcript>: Oh, Geez, it really is. Those are keys.

02:47:31
<transcript>: I just feel like this is now. No.

02:47:34
<transcript>: No.

02:47:34
<transcript>: that's

02:47:35
<transcript>: That's too far.

02:47:38
<transcript>: I'm officially.

02:47:38
<transcript>: i've deemed

02:47:40
<transcript>: you're telling me

02:47:40
<transcript>: I've deemed this too far.

02:47:47
<transcript>: You're telling me your fingers never move. You just move them sideways and up and down. Too much.

02:47:50
<transcript>: Stressing me out here.

02:47:53
<transcript>: No.

02:47:53
<transcript>: is this

02:47:55
<transcript>: Is this supposed to feel like.

02:47:55
<transcript>: if you do

02:48:02
<transcript>: If you do program it to feel like quirity, for instance. Where like it's like instead of actually moving your finger.

02:48:02
<transcript>: you're just pushing it forward

02:48:03
mvd_dev: I thought kenesis took it too far, but this takes the cake

02:48:05
<transcript>: You're just pushing it forward to go up. No, it's too much. Sorry.

02:48:11
<transcript>: That's a that's impressive that some people have gone to those links, I guess. But no.

02:48:18
neochromer: there is a guy on youtube, which made a 16 keys keyboard

02:48:21
<transcript>: Watch the video. I thought Kinesis took it too far. This takes. This is the cake. Yeah, this is. This is beyond.

02:48:21
<transcript>: so there's this

02:48:22
cedpoilly: I'm too old for this "keyboard"

02:48:23
<transcript>: creating a new

02:48:23
<transcript>: So there's this video. Here.

02:48:24
neochromer: where he has like 5 layers

02:48:27
<transcript>: Creating a new standard for the digital age, I guess. Yeah. Like you think about kids.

02:48:31
<transcript>: Think about kids that are learning time for the first time.

02:48:31
<transcript>: it would be nice

02:48:36
<transcript>: It would be nice just to teach them this. It does seem more efficient. I just could never.

02:48:36
<transcript>: i could never

02:48:40
<transcript>: I could never I've been too trained.

02:48:46
<transcript>: So crazy.

02:48:51
<transcript>: Wild.

02:48:52
neochromer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RN_4PQ0j1A&t=961s

02:48:54
cedpoilly: put a chip in my brain at this point

02:48:59
<transcript>: Yeah, I do kind of want to, like, have my kids just learn this way, you know? I bet it is way faster.

02:49:02
neochromer: ^ true

02:49:03
<transcript>: Geez.

02:49:03
mvd_dev: lol @cedpoilly

02:49:06
<transcript>: That is insanely fast.

02:49:14
<transcript>: My brain. Exactly.

02:49:18
mvd_dev: I don't think my brain works that fast

02:49:21
<transcript>: Wow guy I need to which made a 16 keys keyboard.

02:49:23
<transcript>: Has five layers.

02:49:27
<transcript>: I feel so like.

02:49:31
<transcript>: Inadequate with my just like normal.

02:49:31
<transcript>: pk

02:49:33
<transcript>: Pkl. Keyboard right now.

02:49:36
<transcript>: I've got such an old guy.

02:49:36
<transcript>: yeah i don't think

02:49:39
<transcript>: i don't know

02:49:39
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't think my brain works at best, either. I don't feel like.

02:49:43
<transcript>: I don't know. I said that about them. Probably at some point.

02:49:43
<transcript>: and

02:49:44
<transcript>: And.

02:49:44
<transcript>: i think we

02:49:48
<transcript>: I think we surprised ourselves with what we're able to do when we remove friction.

02:49:55
<transcript>: But that just seems like it'd be really hard, really hard for me to learn.

02:49:55
mvd_dev: I have a hard time naming my functions and variables, lol

02:50:03
<transcript>: Okay. I want to actually I'm gonna look at OBS version 28 because it's out officially, and I feel like.

02:50:03
<transcript>: this

02:50:07
neochromer: how do you feel about the speed of neovim now?

02:50:12
<transcript>: why can't i just

02:50:12
<transcript>: This like terrible streamer who's using OBS 27 with like my Mac in one not using native in one support fields bad.

02:50:20
<transcript>: Why can't I just switch over to OBS 28? Well, I have to update my overlays. I know, I know, I know, I hear you all sighing.

02:50:27
<transcript>: Will we ever stop working on the overlays? We'll listen to some music. If that makes it better, we'll send some music while we do it.

02:50:36
<transcript>: Probably just this. Probably just some more LJ, because it's my favorite.

02:50:36
<transcript>: but

02:50:38
schrew: overlays are the bedrock of your content LUL

02:50:38
<transcript>: But we won't start.

02:50:41
<transcript>: We won't start in the same place today.

02:50:42
lchausmann: What are the audio stuff in your obs window?

02:50:43
<transcript>: We'll start.

02:50:45
<transcript>: A little deeper.

02:50:51
<transcript>: Some deeper cuts. I don't want the album commentary. Can I just remove this.

02:50:54
<transcript>: I want to remove it.

02:50:54
<transcript>: from this

02:51:01
<transcript>: From this list, but I want to play this is all yours, and I'm gonna play an awesome wave? We're just gonna start with an awesome wave.

02:51:03
aivars_meijers: I'm back

02:51:04
<transcript>: The music is gonna stop at some point.

02:51:04
<transcript>: oh

02:51:06
<transcript>: Oh avers.

02:51:10

<transcript>: welcome

02:51:15
<transcript>: and there's

02:51:15
<transcript>: Welcome back, Avers. I think you were here earlier, and then you must have started streaming.

02:51:19
<transcript>: And there's 40 of you joining us right now, we just start playing music.

02:51:19
<transcript>: so hope

02:51:23
<transcript>: what we're

02:51:23
<transcript>: So hope you like all Jay because that's what we're listening to.

02:51:31
<transcript>: What we're getting ready to do is update my Twitch overlays again. We keep doing that. We're gonna update them to work with OBS 28, which means.

02:51:31
<transcript>: the

02:51:31
neochromer: @adamelmore we hear nothing :D

02:51:34
<transcript>: The WebSocket Version Five thing.

02:51:37
aivars_meijers: Yeah, I tested OBS 28 and come back :D

02:51:38
<transcript>: Max, thanks so much for the follow you're back.

02:51:42
<transcript>: You hear nothing, neocromer. Oh, no. Is this a troll.

02:51:46
<transcript>: What are the audio stuff in your OBS window.

02:51:50
aivars_meijers: he is troling you

02:51:50
neochromer: sry

02:51:51
<transcript>: why would

02:51:51
<transcript>: Well, you guys may not be hearing anything is what I'm hearing from you.

02:51:54
<transcript>: Why would that not be coming through.

02:51:56
mvd_dev: its very faint

02:51:56
imcorbinn: I hear

02:51:56
neochromer: I had it below 30%

02:51:56
<transcript>: He's trolling me. Okay.

02:51:58
mvd_dev: but I do hear it

02:51:59
neochromer: volume

02:52:06
<transcript>: You're funny. It's very faint. Okay, well, we could turn it up. I think it's probably pretty good based on where it's hitting here, I want it to be too loud.

02:52:06
<transcript>: you are gonna hear

02:52:09
<transcript>: You are gonna hear me talk. Still, unfortunately, it's not just music.

02:52:12
<transcript>: Had it blow through since gotcha.

02:52:13
moussx_: I can't hear the music either

02:52:15
mvd_dev: the voice is good, but music is under powered :)

02:52:16
<transcript>: welcome

02:52:16
<transcript>: Okay, welcome to Chat. Corbin.

02:52:18
<transcript>: Welcome, welcome.

02:52:22
moussx_: But I guess I'll fix my ears

02:52:23
<transcript>: What are the audio stuff in your OBS window? This is like the song we're listening to. Is that what you mean.

02:52:27
<transcript>: Or do you mean this thing loop back.

02:52:27
<transcript>: thanks for

02:52:29
imcorbinn: @aivars_meijers brought me long ^^

02:52:30
lchausmann: mixers and stuff

02:52:31
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow hey comment. Hikamu.

02:52:34
<transcript>: So we're gonna update.

02:52:39
<transcript>: Yeah. You guys came in on the raid. Welcome. I appreciate you all.

02:52:41
<transcript>: The Fix your ears.

02:52:54
<transcript>: Okay. We're going to work with OBS website version five so that we can switch over to 28. Maybe tomorrow. We'll not use version 28. Tomorrow.

02:52:59
<transcript>: i can hear

02:52:59
<transcript>: So that should mostly be in one place.

02:53:01
cedpoilly: music is nice. going for a walk while mostly listening

02:53:01
<transcript>: I can hear.

02:53:07
<transcript>: Let's see. So we have a bunch of WebSocket stuff.

02:53:07
<transcript>: right

02:53:08
seafilmz: Why do you use NeoVim?

02:53:13
<transcript>: Right web stock that can controller that's different OBS WebSocket this thing right here.

02:53:16
<transcript>: We need to look this up. Actually. Obs.

02:53:18
<transcript>: obscure

02:53:19
<transcript>: Obscure.

02:53:22
<transcript>: Obs WebSocket.

02:53:24
<transcript>: As.

02:53:28
<transcript>: Obs.

02:53:35
<transcript>: No, I apologize.

02:53:35
<transcript>: please

02:53:37
<transcript>: Please take me back. There we go.

02:53:45
<transcript>: Let's see via package manager. So I think we ended up installing.

02:53:45
<transcript>: like an old

02:53:47
<transcript>: Like an old version of this.

02:53:50
<transcript>: I think I went back in time.

02:53:50
<transcript>: to work with

02:53:54
<transcript>: To work with version four. And we want to undo that.

02:54:27
<transcript>: I need to just turn the dead server back on while I do this.

02:54:33
<transcript>: Here we go. This is a problem.

02:54:38
<transcript>: Start next up. So I missed this earlier when we did some refactoring.

02:54:41
<transcript>: Start.

02:54:44
<transcript>: Scheduled start.

02:54:44
<transcript>: is

02:54:47
<transcript>: Is what a string are in the find.

02:54:51
<transcript>: Oh.

02:54:53
<transcript>: To read it.

02:54:55
<transcript>: Date.

02:54:55
<transcript>: active

02:54:56
<transcript>: Active.

02:54:56
<transcript>: so object literal

02:55:02
<transcript>: So object literal may only specify known properties. Start does not exist in that thing. Okay.

02:55:07
<transcript>: So we're returning this use stream returns a get stream response.

02:55:10
<transcript>: We're gonna have this. We're gonna have.

02:55:14
<transcript>: For interface.

02:55:19
<transcript>: Use stream response. I think we're going back to where we were sort of.

02:55:24
<transcript>: No, it's gonna be a type.

02:55:26
<transcript>: And.

02:55:29
<transcript>: Gonna be.

02:55:35
<transcript>: And this thing.

02:55:35
<transcript>: what

02:55:38
<transcript>: What is it? Start as a.

02:55:42
<transcript>: Eight, I think.

02:55:47
<transcript>: It run to find.

02:55:52
<transcript>: No, it's on current. So beyond current and next.

02:55:52
<transcript>: so

02:55:53
<transcript>: So.

02:55:59
<transcript>: I think we literally had this, and I just removed it all. Why did I do that.

02:56:08
<transcript>: Or maybe I just need to not expose these. Why don't why am I exposing start. What is start.

02:56:14
<transcript>: It's the scheduled start, but as a date, I just don't need these.

02:56:17
<transcript>: I don't need any of this.

02:56:24
<transcript>: Right. And then this is just next stream.

02:56:30
<transcript>: Right.

02:56:35
<transcript>: Next stream, I guess.

02:56:35
<transcript>: every schedule is

02:56:36
<transcript>: Every schedule is missing.

02:56:41
<transcript>: well is it

02:56:42
<transcript>: Well, is it.

02:56:46
<transcript>: I schedule missing. Do we not get scheduled from here.

02:56:54
<transcript>: The reason I have this hook is so that when the title changes.

02:56:58
<transcript>: We get the updated title through the Twitch event. That's what it is.

02:57:05
<transcript>: I can't schedule equals data. Schedule.

02:57:09
<transcript>: and then schedule here is just

02:57:09
<transcript>: And then Schedule here is just.

02:57:11
<transcript>: Right.

02:57:11
<transcript>: it can't be

02:57:13
<transcript>: It can't be undefined.

02:57:13
<transcript>: is that what you're saying

02:57:15
<transcript>: Is that what you're saying? Well.

02:57:18
<transcript>: That.

02:57:18
<transcript>: not undefined

02:57:20
<transcript>: so

02:57:20
<transcript>: Not undefined.

02:57:23
<transcript>: So next next stream. We're just gonna say this.

02:57:23
<transcript>: let's just do

02:57:25
<transcript>: Let's just do this.

02:57:27
oskrm: why no 20j instead of jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj

02:57:34
<transcript>: Why am I doing this stream active default to false.

02:57:34
<transcript>: why am i doing that

02:57:36
<transcript>: Why am I doing that.

02:57:40
<transcript>: Scratch all this.

02:57:48
<transcript>: And then this is get stream response. That's good. Okay.

02:57:48
<transcript>: yeah

02:57:49
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:57:49
<transcript>: what's the problem i'm just really

02:57:53
<transcript>: What's the problem? I'm just really trying to overcome override the title. That's all I'm trying to do.

02:57:56
<transcript>: So.

02:58:00
<transcript>: This is all done. I'm doing this all in a dumb way.

02:58:00
<transcript>: current

02:58:03
<transcript>: Current Next schedule.

02:58:07
<transcript>: Equals.

02:58:07
<transcript>: data

02:58:09
<transcript>: Data.

02:58:17
<transcript>: Set title.

02:58:18
<transcript>: Current.

02:58:26
<transcript>: This can just be.

02:58:33
<transcript>: How do I do this a cool way. I want to delete back to the colon. So I'll do.

02:58:33
<transcript>: delete

02:58:34
<transcript>: Delete.

02:58:40
<transcript>: Like that. Oh, what did I carry with me? I didn't include the end. So here.

02:58:40
<transcript>: delete

02:58:42
<transcript>: Delete.

02:58:45
<transcript>: Like that cool them stuff.

02:58:47
<transcript>: Skip schedule.

02:58:47
<transcript>: it needs

02:58:49
<transcript>: It needs to be defaulted. I guess.

02:58:54
<transcript>: Schedule.

02:58:58
<transcript>: Okay.

02:59:00
<transcript>: I miss one up here.

02:59:08
<transcript>: Okay, so current next and schedule. That all looks good. Okay, so where are we using this.

02:59:08
<transcript>: u stream

02:59:10
<transcript>: U stream.

02:59:15
<transcript>: Here. This the only place? Yeah.

02:59:15
<transcript>: i should use it

02:59:17
<transcript>: I should use it another place. I'm not.

02:59:22
<transcript>: In fact, we should probably update that.

02:59:28
<transcript>: We're not gonna try now I just want to get building.

02:59:32
<transcript>: Okay. Nothing broken.

02:59:34
<transcript>: We all good.

02:59:36
<transcript>: All good.

02:59:36
<transcript>: if we

02:59:53
<transcript>: Just bad at them.

03:00:09
oskrm: you have the relative number already just look at the number

03:00:09
<transcript>: Why do you use Neil them? Sea films. So I started using Neil them because I came to Twitch and I learned of Neil them. So I played with them throughout my career. Like various times I've tried to get into them.

03:00:23
<transcript>: I wasn't even really aware of knew of him until I joined the Twitch community. And then I saw all these fantastic streams like Tee's and prime using the OVM and Bunny. I decided.

03:00:23
<transcript>: i'd

03:00:29
<transcript>: I'd like to play with this, and I felt for it. I'm super into it. Like I love it.

03:00:49
<transcript>: I think it's at this point. It's like it's not just about, like, efficiently or like there's a lot of benefits to them. And I get it. But I think it's more just like a hobby. It's just fun. It's nice to inject something fun, just like Twitch. I mean, it's been nice to stream just inject something into my career. At this point, 15 years in things start to stagnate, starts to get kind of like.

03:00:49
<transcript>: stiff

03:00:51
<transcript>: Stiff and you're not doing anything new.

03:01:09
<transcript>: Neil Them has been kind of refreshing to, like, actually play with my editor more and have that as a hobby. Like, I got into mechanical keyboards for a few weeks. That was a fun hobby. But then mostly they're settled and I have my keyboards and I like them. This is a way to kind of like constantly be evolving and playing with my editor.

03:01:21
<transcript>: Yeah, Oscar.

03:01:26
<transcript>: Are you seriously? Did you seriously PR fix for that.

03:01:36
<transcript>: You're the best.

03:01:39
cedpoilly: @adamelmore bon app√©tit

03:01:39
<transcript>: Latin over here. Just fixing stuff.

03:01:48
<transcript>: I love the.

03:01:48
<transcript>: i love the thick

03:01:51
schrew: oh he be PRing

03:01:52
<transcript>: I love the thick let me know if this die had any reason to be there.

03:01:52
<transcript>: that's awesome

03:01:53
<transcript>: That's awesome.

03:02:09
<transcript>: You should've said, like I'm sure this removing this dot breaks every other language, but I only write jobscript, and I don't care that's the power move.

03:02:10
cboorg: LUL

03:02:11
oskrm: those evil dots LUL

03:02:24
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. So probably I'm eating. Sorry, I do that. Sometimes I eat my Lara bars on occasion. Oscar. So I have the relative emergency lookout number. Yeah, it's kind of like everything with them. I mean, you know, the command just use a command. It just takes time, you know.

03:02:24
<transcript>: there's a lot of

03:02:31
<transcript>: There's a lot of commands I know that I don't use because I just haven't become natural yet. So occasionally you'll see me be like.

03:02:31
<transcript>: oh i need

03:02:39
<transcript>: Oh, I need to delete like these three lines. And I'll look at the rows of number and be like delete three J. I'll do that occasionally.

03:02:43
<transcript>: So very much for Snipe to think about it. It's not naturally yet.

03:02:45
oskrm: okay, just want you to do cool stuff :)

03:02:55
<transcript>: Same with the page up and down. Like, should I just page up and page down all the time? Yeah, but do I just J okay. All the time? 1000%. Yes. Eventually. I think I'll get there.

03:02:55
<transcript>: so

03:02:57
<transcript>: So.

03:03:01
<transcript>: All right.

03:03:12
<transcript>: Just want you to do cool stuff. Me too. I appreciate it. I was gay. You're good.

03:03:22
<transcript>: What we're doing, we're gonna update OBS WebSocket. Was I in the middle of anything. We fixed this, and it's actually built now so we can make changes to our overlays and not completely.

03:03:22
<transcript>: break everything

03:03:24
<transcript>: Break everything.

03:03:25
<transcript>: Right.

03:03:25
<transcript>: i think

03:03:27
<transcript>: I think.

03:03:30
sarjahukkuja: You can decrease the key repeat speed to force you not to do it by holding the key down

03:03:31
<transcript>: I think so.

03:03:37
<transcript>: What we're gonna do is we're gonna go into the OBS controller.

03:03:39
<transcript>: Here.

03:03:45
<transcript>: And now we're updating to use this. Here we go.

03:03:45
<transcript>: for version

03:03:51
<transcript>: For version five. So we're gonna install the latest. That's right. I was in package JSON.

03:04:00
<transcript>: We're looking for OBS. Yeah? So version four, three? That's no good anymore we want to do.

03:04:00
<transcript>: we want to do

03:04:01
<transcript>: We want to do.

03:04:01
<transcript>: yarn

03:04:03
<transcript>: Yarn.

03:04:03
<transcript>: install

03:04:04
<transcript>: Install.

03:04:04
<transcript>: for yarn add

03:04:05
<transcript>: For yarn. Add.

03:04:05
<transcript>: obs

03:04:08
<transcript>: Obs WebSocket.

03:04:11
<transcript>: I'm just doing this to get the latest.

03:04:19
<transcript>: We're moving to version Five, living in the future. Well, this is the present now, I guess.

03:04:28
<transcript>: We were living in the past.

03:04:28
<transcript>: we're catching

03:04:30
<transcript>: We're catching up.

03:04:36
<transcript>: That's a great.

03:04:36
<transcript>: call

03:04:39
<transcript>: Call Sarge if I didn't have such a fast keyword.

03:04:42
<transcript>: It would probably do me crazy, wouldn't it.

03:04:53
<transcript>: Just refresh a buffer.

03:04:53
<transcript>: i know

03:04:55
<transcript>: I know this files like out of date.

03:04:59
<transcript>: Even though new of them how I would just refresh it.

03:05:07
sarjahukkuja: ':edit

03:05:07
oskrm: there is no present. we are always delayed even nanoseconds

03:05:18
<transcript>: See, I know it's out of date because look, everything's broken now, that's great. That means TypeScript is doing its job.

03:05:27
<transcript>: But why Package JSON not updated? There it is. 5015. Yeah.

03:05:29
<transcript>: Okay. So we have dated that.

03:05:39
<transcript>: Now we can start fixing all these things that are broken. We should have just stuff broken in this one file. I think just changing this one file should get us where we want to be.

03:05:45
<transcript>: Oh, you know what.

03:05:49
<transcript>: I should I should commit. I should go.

03:05:53
<transcript>: The changes.

03:05:58
<transcript>: I want to add everything.

03:06:04
<transcript>: Except for Package JSON.

03:06:04
<transcript>: and

03:06:05
<transcript>: And Yarn lock.

03:06:08
<transcript>: So.

03:06:08
<transcript>: get add

03:06:09
<transcript>: Get add.

03:06:15
<transcript>: Then I'll just, like, get removed, the ones I don't want.

03:06:19
<transcript>: To unstage yeah, good get restore.

03:06:22
<transcript>: Staged.

03:06:24
<transcript>: Package JSON.

03:06:26
<transcript>: Get restore.

03:06:26
<transcript>: stage

03:06:29
<transcript>: Staged Yarn lock.

03:06:32
<transcript>: This should have used pnpm.

03:06:34
<transcript>: It's just better.

03:06:34
<transcript>: oh

03:06:36
<transcript>: Oh, we didn't add.

03:06:41
wedged_emperor: vscode extention version lens will show every package latest version in package.json

03:06:43
<transcript>: That stream. That's fine. Okay. It keeps changing, because every time I talk, it changes. Every time you send a chat message.

03:06:43
<transcript>: okay

03:06:44
<transcript>: Okay.

03:06:49
<transcript>: So commit. I want to commit this stuff. Get commit.

03:06:51
<transcript>: Six.

03:06:54
<transcript>: Build issues I don't even know that we're anymore.

03:06:54
<transcript>: that was so

03:06:56
<transcript>: That was so five minutes ago.

03:07:00
<transcript>: Okay.

03:07:06
<transcript>: Check all this stuff so OBS connect with the same argument of type address strings.

03:07:06
<transcript>: stringstring

03:07:11
<transcript>: Stringstring. That's a good call. They just made it. Now, in version Five, you just pass the string.

03:07:11
cdewex: HeyGuys

03:07:14
<transcript>: I'm gonna go delete.

03:07:16
<transcript>: Delete.

03:07:21
<transcript>: To perenn, and then delete two per in.

03:07:24
<transcript>: There we go.

03:07:26
<transcript>: And what's this one.

03:07:36
<transcript>: Even if I switch scenes is not a signable parameter type connection opened. What is this? Okay.

03:07:37
schrew: adamel4Ope

03:07:40
<transcript>: So it's not. It's an article. Switch Teams. It's called what.

<transcript>: Name changed? No.

03:07:52
<transcript>: current scene

03:07:54
<transcript>: Current scene.

03:07:57
<transcript>: Current.

03:07:57
<transcript>: scene

03:07:58
<transcript>: Scene.

03:07:58
<transcript>: changed

03:08:01
<transcript>: Changed? No.

03:08:01
<transcript>: program

03:08:06
<transcript>: Program scene changed. Ah, that's it. I think that's it.

03:08:06
oskrm: thre is no migration guide?

03:08:12
<transcript>: Data. Looks like what now.

03:08:12
<transcript>: c name

03:08:16
<transcript>: C name oh feels good enough of this nonsense.

03:08:28
<transcript>: I don't want to do that. I want to delete outer.

03:08:28
<transcript>: so delet

03:08:30
<transcript>: So delete.

03:08:30
<transcript>: lead out

03:08:33
<transcript>: Lead outer like that. Yeah.

03:08:36
<transcript>: Not dated out. See name.

03:08:36
<transcript>: okay

03:08:38
<transcript>: Okay.

03:08:45
<transcript>: As seen what was wrong with this one sin. That's probably not. So I want current scene.

03:08:55
<transcript>: That really is surely not. No.

03:08:56
<transcript>: Scene.

03:09:00
sarjahukkuja: @wedged_emperor sounds like the same as plugin 'package-info.nvim' in nvim

03:09:03
<transcript>: There's that current get no.

03:09:03
<transcript>: okay time for

03:09:05
<transcript>: Okay. Time for the docs.

03:09:05
<transcript>: look at the dot

03:09:08
<transcript>: Look at the Dot's and see what version five.

03:09:08
<transcript>: i think

03:09:11
<transcript>: I think they're somewhere where it lists. All these. Right.

03:09:14
<transcript>: For four to five. Here we go.

03:09:22
<transcript>: Sin has been replaced with call.

03:09:32
<transcript>: There is a migration guard. We're looking at it now. Welcome to Chat. Did I break.

03:09:34
<transcript>: Oh.

03:09:34

03:09:47
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:09:55
oskrm: there was I think, you just were busy

03:09:55
<transcript>: Vs. Code Extension version Lens will show every package latest version Impact JSON welcome to Chat wedge.

03:09:58
<transcript>: We are no longer using vs code.

03:09:58
<transcript>: there's

03:10:02
<transcript>: There's a notification we're using neovem.

03:10:02
<transcript>: so

03:10:06
<transcript>: So I think I did use lens one upon a time in vs. Code though.

03:10:06
<transcript>: also

03:10:13
<transcript>: Also welcome to chat CD, Wix CDEW X welcome Hello, hey, guys.

03:10:13
<transcript>: oh

03:10:15
<transcript>: Oh.

03:10:16
pumpumcity: is neovim any good? just dont get why they dont allow you to test it for free

03:10:19
<transcript>: Packageinfo MVM okay.

03:10:19
<transcript>: pump

03:10:26
<transcript>: Pump. Welcome to Chat. Is new of him any good? Just don't get why they don't allow you to test it for free. What.

03:10:29
<transcript>: I have not paid for neovem.

03:10:31
<transcript>: Not one Penny.

03:10:35
<transcript>: Where did you see the paper, Neil? Them.

03:10:42
oskrm: I too haven't pay for nvim

03:10:44
<transcript>: There was there was. I think you were just busy. Okay. I just didn't hear it. Okay. Cool. Thanks for the follow. Draven.

03:10:47
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't think neovim cost money.

03:10:47
<transcript>: i don't think so

03:10:49
<transcript>: I don't think so.

03:10:52
<transcript>: So we need to look.

03:10:52
<transcript>: obviously

03:10:54
schrew: you STOLE neovim? jk

03:11:02
<transcript>: Obviously only F dot X five X of OBS four. In case an older version of the surface detector, the connection is automatically closed and connect promise is rejected.

03:11:02
<transcript>: distribution

03:11:05
<transcript>: Distribution files target a more modern environment.

03:11:05
<transcript>: like for smart

03:11:07
<transcript>: Like for smart builds. Okay.

03:11:13
schrew: you wouldn't steal a car, would you?

03:11:17
<transcript>: Async connect.

03:11:22
<transcript>: Has been changed. Yeah. We just ran into this. So it's no longer.

03:11:25
ballpointcarrot: you wouldn't download a neovim üòÅ

03:11:28
cedpoilly: Do you pay with your time & brain power? Just like with Linux? (except if you use PopOS)

03:11:31
<transcript>: Arg as an object. It's just pass the address and then a password is optional and options are optional. Cool.

03:11:31
oskrm: I would if I knew how to exit it LUL

03:11:35
<transcript>: So send I feel like we use Cind a lot.

03:11:35
<transcript>: it's saying

03:11:47
<transcript>: It's saying don't do that. It's been replaced with call aligning with simple OBS WebSocket due to changes between OBS website four and five. Like, we need to check all Sin calls anyway to match the new request names. Yeah.

03:11:53
<transcript>: Sin callback has been removed. I don't think I use SIM callback. Okay, so where do I see.

03:11:53
<transcript>: here we go

03:11:57
<transcript>: Here we go. This is the Docs for the actual API.

03:12:00
<transcript>: This will have all the names that I'm looking for. Maybe.

03:12:18
oskrm: so weird to change "send" to "call"

03:12:21
cedpoilly: @oskrm we could create a PAID mini course: "How to exit vim"

03:12:24
<transcript>: What is the deal here.

03:12:28
<transcript>: I want the list of things like this.

03:12:32
<transcript>: Here we go. Scene requests. Okay.

03:12:41
<transcript>: So get current program scene.

03:12:41
<transcript>: is what

03:12:43
<transcript>: Is what this one should be.

03:12:46
<transcript>: Current.

03:12:48
oleksii_lisovyi: What's up Adam üëã

03:12:50
<transcript>: Get current okay these aren't send anymore.

03:12:50
<transcript>: their call

03:12:52
<transcript>: Their call.

03:12:55
cedpoilly: We'd get rich üí∑

03:12:58
<transcript>: Get current.

03:12:58
<transcript>: current

03:13:01
<transcript>: Current Program theme.

03:13:01
<transcript>: perfect

03:13:04
<transcript>: Perfect. It's gonna be easy. I don't think it's gonna be a big deal.

03:13:08
<transcript>: Now it's current program C name.

03:13:18
oleksii_lisovyi: !today

03:13:18
fossabot: Building a Twitch overlay in Next.JS

03:13:19
<transcript>: This OBS on current program scene changed so on didn't change just call instead of send.

03:13:22
<transcript>: Current program theme changed.

03:13:26
<transcript>: Actually, I just make sure real quick.

03:13:29
cedpoilly: It would cause problems with the memes authorities though

03:13:33
<transcript>: That we don't use this anymore. So let's do Yamiche yank inside quotes.

03:13:37
<transcript>: Did I do it? Yankees? I Quotes. And I want to do.

03:13:46
<transcript>: Package JSON use OBS. Oh interesting. We have a hook for use OBS. Is that being used at all.

03:13:49
<transcript>: Anyone using use OBS.

03:13:50
<transcript>: obsc

03:13:52
<transcript>: Obsc use OBS.

03:13:55
<transcript>: Now we can delete this entire thing.

03:13:59
<transcript>: Whole file goes away.

03:14:02
<transcript>: I'm not doing that on the client side anymore.

03:14:02
ballpointcarrot: does that cast to Scene still make sense if you're just returning a name?

03:14:03
<transcript>: And.

03:14:04
<transcript>: get out of here

03:14:05
<transcript>: Get out of here.

03:14:10
<transcript>: Oh, that one I want to do.

03:14:10
<transcript>: delete

03:14:12
<transcript>: Delete. How do I delete like that.

03:14:22
<transcript>: Okay. I did it. I deleted it. So now it's just the OBS file. Cool. I just want to make sure.

03:14:30
<transcript>: Obs WebSocket. Yeah. Package, JSON yarn lock. And then this very file that we're in right now. Okay, cool.

03:14:33
<transcript>: So current program scene changed.

03:14:33
<transcript>: we change that

03:14:34
<transcript>: We change that.

03:14:38
<transcript>: Here in Stream. It's now call.

03:14:41
<transcript>: Let's do this.

03:14:52
<transcript>: And all the calls.

03:14:52
<transcript>: and sins

03:14:54
<transcript>: And sins? Yeah.

03:14:56
ballpointcarrot: nvm, looks like you have that elsewhere too

03:14:57
<transcript>: Listen, cool.

03:14:57
<transcript>: so

03:14:59
<transcript>: So up here.

03:15:03
<transcript>: Thanks for follow pump pump pump pump.

03:15:09
<transcript>: We are kind of building a Twitch overlay. I never update the today saying Alexey, I really should.

03:15:15
<transcript>: I'm paid minicourse how to exit Them. Yeah, it's kind of weird.

03:15:18
<transcript>: Kind of weird.

03:15:23
<transcript>: Welcome to Chatball Point Carrot. You wouldn't download a neovim.

03:15:25
<transcript>: Wouldn't download it.

03:15:28
<transcript>: I.

03:15:31
<transcript>: Saw many of them.

03:15:38
<transcript>: Brainpower just like with Linux.

03:15:39
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:15:43
<transcript>: Except I use Mac, Mac, Mac OS.

03:15:48
<transcript>: What's up, Alexi.

03:15:51
<transcript>: I need update to today command. More.

03:15:57
<transcript>: Need to do that.

03:16:02
<transcript>: Does that kind of cast? The scene still makes sense if you're returning a name.

03:16:16
mvd_dev: Unix, close enough.

03:16:18
<transcript>: Yeah, I think we the contract outside expects it to be our little, like discriminated Union. So this is gonna be stop streaming, stop stream. They just name them. Just are they renamed like every single thing just to rename it? I think.

03:16:18
<transcript>: refresh

03:16:19
<transcript>: Refresh.

03:16:24
<transcript>: Source.

03:16:29
<transcript>: Brief refresh.

03:16:34
<transcript>: Browser. Oh, can I not do this.

03:16:34
<transcript>: other source

03:16:35
<transcript>: Other source.

03:16:41
<transcript>: Use this in case. Okay, so press input properties button up. Geez.

03:16:44
<transcript>: I have to press the button now. Browser Sources Where there's a refresh button.

03:16:47
<transcript>: Oof.

03:16:50
<transcript>: So how do I find out what I.

03:16:58
<transcript>: Press is a button in the properties of an input. This feels like a step backward. Let me an honest.

03:17:07
<transcript>: Use this in cases where there is a button in the properties of an input that cannot be accessed in any other way. Well, it used to be something I could access.

03:17:07
<transcript>: i used to

03:17:15
<transcript>: I used to be able to access it through the Refresh browser source command. Why did you remove that OBS? Why did you do that.

03:17:23
<transcript>: For example, there's a refresh button. So request fields input name name name of the input. So I'm going to find the name of the input. How do I find the name of the input.

03:17:23
<transcript>: and then

03:17:28
<transcript>: And then property name, name, name of the Button property. Depress of G's.

03:17:28
<transcript>: obs

03:17:34
<transcript>: Obs WebSocket v. Five Refresh Browser source.

03:17:36
<transcript>: Come on. People.

03:17:38
<transcript>: It should be so easy.

03:17:42
<transcript>: Reset scene item to a browser does not reload the page.

03:17:52
<transcript>: Programmatically press refresh cache of Butt current page. That's not what I want.

03:17:54
<transcript>: But I'm curious what is.

03:17:59
<transcript>: In four, dot, whatever.

03:18:06
<transcript>: So.

03:18:11
<transcript>: Add Browser Source Interaction API in 2021.

03:18:13
<transcript>: Maybe some we talked about in here.

03:18:13
<transcript>: browser

03:18:14
<transcript>: Browser.

03:18:16
<transcript>: Source.

03:18:19
<transcript>: Refresh.

03:18:22
<transcript>: Oh.

03:18:37
<transcript>: That's yeah. Featurecraft Add Browser Source Interaction API that doesn't look like this has been done.

03:18:39
<transcript>: Send hotkey.

03:18:59
<transcript>: Maybe we'll search. What was the name of that.

03:19:05
<transcript>: Press Input Properties button. I guess that's the recommended way to do this now.

03:19:12
<transcript>: Refresh browser source someone else has had this problem.

03:19:15
<transcript>: There's a trail of Google searches.

03:19:20
<transcript>: Must include.

03:19:20
<transcript>: okay

03:19:21
<transcript>: Okay.

03:19:30
<transcript>: And these requests.

03:19:36
<transcript>: Gets seen item list.

03:19:39
<transcript>: Press Input properties.

03:19:44
<transcript>: Well, what if we did this? What if we searched.

03:19:51
<transcript>: What if we searched.

03:19:54
<transcript>: For that button.

03:19:57
<transcript>: In the source code of OBS.

03:20:00
<transcript>: Obs source code.

03:20:04
<transcript>: Such a dumb thing to search source code.

03:20:04
<transcript>: we got to find

03:20:06
<transcript>: We got to find the source code.

03:20:06
<transcript>: obs

03:20:08
<transcript>: Obs studio freedom. So, okay, this is the.

03:20:12
<transcript>: Refresh. This is this is a lot here.

03:20:20
<transcript>: Browser. Source. Hey, here it is. Refresh, browser. I found it.

03:20:22
<transcript>: I really did it.

03:20:22

03:20:25
<transcript>: Widget Class Q Push Button Name refresh.

03:20:25
<transcript>: property

03:20:26
<transcript>: Property.

03:20:28
<transcript>: Refresh browser.

03:20:30
<transcript>: Did I do it.

03:20:39
<transcript>: Properties Add button props, button, refresh.

03:20:43
<transcript>: So is this it? I'll see.

03:20:43
<transcript>: cloud

03:20:52
<transcript>: Cloud name refresh. So I have to pass it an input name, name of the input. Okay. And a property name. And I think the properties name is this thing.

03:20:52
<transcript>: right

03:20:53
<transcript>: Right.

03:20:53
<transcript>: refresh

03:20:57
<transcript>: Refresh browser maybe am I making this up.

03:21:07
<transcript>: Browser Source toolbar.

03:21:16
<transcript>: What is this? What am I looking at? Dot. Ui? What is this framework for defining the UI.

03:21:24
<transcript>: I just have very little confidence. This is gonna work.

03:21:42
<transcript>: Q Push button.

03:21:42
<transcript>: refresh

03:21:48
<transcript>: Refresh. I feel like that's the name of the well. Is it.

03:21:48
<transcript>: this is

03:21:55
<transcript>: This is so bad they should at least have a link to some docs or something that tells you where to find any of this. How would I know where to find these? You know.

03:22:09
<transcript>: Is there a way to get oh, here we go. Get input properties. List property items Gipsy items of a list property from an input property.

03:22:14
<transcript>: Use this in cases where an input provides a dynamic selectable sub items not.

03:22:19
<transcript>: Okay. We're gonna come back to this one. This feels bad.

03:22:22
<transcript>: Feels real bad.

03:22:25
<transcript>: We want to do this refresh browser sort of thing.

03:22:31
<transcript>: Now we do this. We do this. And we want to keep doing it.

03:22:46
<transcript>: Okay.

03:22:49
<transcript>: Right now it's going to do nothing until we figure that out.

03:22:53
<transcript>: I'm gonna put the name here.

03:22:56
<transcript>: So don't forget.

03:23:01
<transcript>: Copy it.

03:23:08
<transcript>: Why? Why is it not working? Press input.

03:23:08
<transcript>: proper

03:23:11
<transcript>: Properties button.

03:23:16
<transcript>: Okay, so we're gonna hope we can figure that out. Set scene. Let's see if this one's easier.

03:23:16
<transcript>: but this is gonna be

03:23:18
<transcript>: But this is gonna be easier.

03:23:20
<transcript>: At current.

03:23:23
<transcript>: Program scene. Okay.

03:23:23
<transcript>: so just

03:23:26
<transcript>: So just split those out to be like.

03:23:35
<transcript>: To start a line.

03:23:38
<transcript>: How does that work? How does that work.

03:23:46
<transcript>: Like that.

03:23:46
<transcript>: oh

03:23:53
<transcript>: Oh, it's doing actual UPcare. I want to, like, go delete to the beginning line, so just delete like that.

03:23:56
<transcript>: Scene name.

03:23:59
<transcript>: Okay.

03:24:16
<transcript>: So set scene. That one's good. That was easy.

03:24:26
<transcript>: Is that all of them. I don't actually do that much with the WebSocket API just a little bit. So we're gonna be ready to move over to OBS 28 very soon.

03:24:26
<transcript>: sort out

03:24:29
<transcript>: Sort out refresh browser stores.

03:25:12
<transcript>: Well.

03:25:18
<transcript>: How am I supposed to find those.

03:25:23
<transcript>: Name of the input.

03:25:26
<transcript>: We found this thing.

03:25:33
<transcript>: Browser Source toolbar.

03:25:33
<transcript>: is that the

03:25:34
<transcript>: Is that the input.

03:25:40
<transcript>: I don't think that's the input.

03:25:40
<transcript>: here

03:25:43
<transcript>: Here's the Refresh button.

03:25:48
<transcript>: So I think his name, that.

03:25:51
<transcript>: What's the input.

03:25:58
<transcript>: Well then also we need to.

03:26:01
<transcript>: Is the input like the source.

03:26:06
<transcript>: So.

03:26:06
<transcript>: you have

03:26:10
<transcript>: You have an input that can be access, for example, browser Sources where there's a refresh button.

03:26:10
<transcript>: so

03:26:19
<transcript>: So the name of the input would be like the name of my like these these sources, they're called inputs here. In this case, I guess.

03:26:23
<transcript>: Is that what we're seeing.

03:26:23
<transcript>: so

03:26:28
<transcript>: So be like shared overlay. Because somehow I have to specify which.

03:26:32
<transcript>: Yeah, and then name of the button property depress property name.

03:26:47
<transcript>: I think I think that's gonna be it's gonna be.

03:26:47
<transcript>: i guess

03:26:51
<transcript>: I guess this one's gonna be named refresh.

03:26:53
<transcript>: Refresh browser.

03:26:56
<transcript>: Property, text.

03:27:06
<transcript>: Yeah, we'll try that. I mean, I have no way to test any of this right now. I guess I could switch over to 28, and just we could see maybe I should download OBS 28. Let's do that.

03:27:10
<transcript>: First we're gonna do here we're gonna say.

03:27:16
<transcript>: Property now input name.

03:27:19
<transcript>: Is source name.

03:27:19
<transcript>: actually

03:27:24
<transcript>: Actually, it's just we're gonna rename it the input name and then property name.

03:27:27
<transcript>: Is refresh browser.

03:27:27
<transcript>: i guess

03:27:28
<transcript>: I guess.

03:27:32
<transcript>: I don't know.

03:27:38
<transcript>: Property name, refresh, browser. Maybe it's refresh, maybe that's what it should be but.

03:27:43
<transcript>: Name.

03:27:45
<transcript>: Okay.

03:27:47
<transcript>: We'll try that.

03:27:51
<transcript>: We will try it.

03:27:51
<transcript>: that's

03:27:57
<transcript>: That's it. We did it. We're ready for OBS 28. Now let's download a bit of 28.

03:36:16
<transcript>: Thanks, Mattie. Two Shoes for the animations. If you'd also like to submit animations to the GitHub repo, I'd love that.

03:36:47
<transcript>: Okay. Fine.

03:36:47
<transcript>: we

03:36:51
<transcript>: We won't try and run it side by side. We will.

03:36:55
<transcript>: Maybe run OBS.

03:36:58
<transcript>: The two versions.

03:36:58
<transcript>: at once

03:36:59
<transcript>: At once.

03:37:03
<transcript>: To run, multiplied.

03:37:03
<transcript>: aha

03:37:06
<transcript>: Aha on Windows ten.

03:37:09
<transcript>: On Mac.

03:37:17
<transcript>: Portal mode? That's what I'm looking for. Portable mode.

03:37:21
<transcript>: Portable mode.

03:37:26
<transcript>: Obs.

03:37:26
<transcript>: maco

03:37:29

03:37:30
<transcript>: Mode.

03:37:33
<transcript>: We say It's gonna work.

03:37:42
<transcript>: Maybe.

03:37:47
<transcript>: Obs Project OBS studio.

03:37:59
<transcript>: So Studio mode they say.

03:38:09
<transcript>: When even the question on Stack overflow has a down vote, it's probably a bad, bad sign.

03:38:17
<transcript>: Portable mode troubles.

03:38:22
<transcript>: Seems like OBSC.

03:38:22
<transcript>: obscure

03:38:24
<transcript>: Obscure.

03:38:32
<transcript>: Studio mode. Okay, so we just need to add the Studio mode flag to run the new OBS.

03:38:32
<transcript>: okay

03:38:35
<transcript>: Okay. I'm a little nervous to run this, actually.

03:38:41
<transcript>: A. Dmg that's like an installer, right.

03:38:41
<transcript>: if i open

03:38:46
<transcript>: If I open this, that's just another OBS app. So I'm gonna put it in a different folder.

03:38:50
<transcript>: A different place, not just drop it in applications.

03:39:00
<transcript>: Here, let's put it in.

03:39:04
<transcript>: I don't know. Sure. Right here.

03:39:11
<transcript>: All right, we're gonna try out a lacarde.

03:39:11
<transcript>: that's what i really

03:39:13
<transcript>: That's what I really want to do.

03:39:13
<transcript>: i'm just

03:39:17
<transcript>: I'm just gonna see if I can run 28 at the same time with the studio mode thing.

03:39:17
<transcript>: ob

03:39:19
<transcript>: Obs.

03:39:23
<transcript>: Zoom App Content Megalis.

03:39:32
<transcript>: So if I call, let's just do a new one of these. Let's just do.

03:39:36
<transcript>: We're already here. So.

03:39:38
<transcript>: obs

03:39:40
<transcript>: Obs.

03:39:42
<transcript>: So if I do.

03:39:48
<transcript>: Yes. App. Can I do that like that.

03:39:52
<transcript>: Obs.

03:39:57
<transcript>: So kind of run an app like that, anyone know.

03:39:57
<transcript>: we're gonna try

03:40:01
<transcript>: We're gonna try it OBS app Studio mode.

03:40:01
<transcript>: stud

03:40:03
<transcript>: Studio.

03:40:07
<transcript>: Code? What's? What are the P in the impact.

03:40:17
<transcript>: Studio mode. Here we go. File OBS app is not executable by this user.

03:40:19
<transcript>: Why not.

03:40:25
<transcript>: Ch mod plus X.

03:40:30
<transcript>: Obs app that.

03:40:30
<transcript>: like this is

03:40:32
<transcript>: Like, this is how you do it.

03:40:35
<transcript>: I need to go into the contents. Maybe.

03:40:36
lchausmann: its a directory find the bin directory under contents

03:40:38
lchausmann: i think

03:40:38
<transcript>: I need to go into the contents.

03:40:42
<transcript>: So we need to do this. We need to do.

03:40:43
<transcript>: Obs.

03:40:43
<transcript>: app

03:40:46
<transcript>: App content.

03:40:46
laytanl_: My PR has been merged already

03:40:51
<transcript>: Now we can do OBS.

03:40:51
<transcript>: or

03:40:53
<transcript>: Or OBS.

03:40:54
keraion: --portable, -p Use portable mode. --multi, -m Don't warn when launching multiple instances.

03:40:57
<transcript>: Yes.

03:40:58
<transcript>: Mode.

03:41:05
<transcript>: Is gonna break obsceni running unless you meant to do this, please shut down any existing instances OBS for chinasis.

03:41:10
<transcript>: Launch anyway. Nah, we're not gonna do it. It's too risky.

03:41:10
<transcript>: we'll play with this

03:41:12
<transcript>: We'll play with this offstream.

03:41:12
<transcript>: portable

03:41:26
<transcript>: Portable P use portable mode multi. And I'll think you so much Caroline, our carryon. I appreciate that a ton late in your PR's already merged. How awesome is this? Look at this.

03:41:29
<transcript>: Leighton, you're on fire.

03:41:33
<transcript>: Just fixing stuff that was so fast.

03:41:33
<transcript>: so you're telling

03:41:40
<transcript>: So you're telling me if I get latest at treesetter, we're gonna do this. This is awesome. We're gonna get latest a tree setter. We're gonna see if it just fixes.

03:41:45
<transcript>: The thing latent. Just fix the thing just like that on stream. Love it.

03:41:57
<transcript>: Portable and multi don't worn when launching multiple instances. So is it safe? Carry on. Welcome to Chat. By the way, is it safe for me to run OBS twice? Do you recommend it.

03:41:59
<transcript>: Is this a terrible idea.

03:42:00
keraion: No idea

03:42:05
<transcript>: I wonder. I wonder. No idea. Okay, that's fine.

03:42:05
<transcript>: i think i'm just

03:42:07
<transcript>: I think I'm just gonna play with an offstream.

03:42:15
<transcript>: I'm not gonna risk it. I don't want to kill the stream just because I'm playing with 28, but I think tomorrow we'll be running on 28, which means.

03:42:15
<transcript>: the c

03:42:19
<transcript>: The CPU. So right now 17% should be lower.

03:42:19
<transcript>: that's really

03:42:22
<transcript>: That's really all it'll mean for you, I guess.

03:42:22
<transcript>: you

03:42:24
<transcript>: You won't know any better.

03:42:29
<transcript>: Let's play with a lacarde.

03:42:31
<transcript>: Alacrity.

03:42:35
<transcript>: That's not it.

03:42:35
<transcript>: alacrity

03:42:36
<transcript>: Alacrity.

03:42:38
<transcript>: Do I spell it wrong.

03:42:41
<transcript>: cross platform

03:42:42
<transcript>: Cross platform.

03:42:42
<transcript>: open deal

03:42:44
<transcript>: Open Deal Terminal emulator.

03:42:48
<transcript>: Okay, let's see.

03:43:05
<transcript>: Modern terminal Emilio that comes with sensible default for the last extensive configuration by integrating with other applications rather than you're implementing their functionality, it manages to provide a flexible set of features with high performance for platform currently consist of Linux, Mac OS, and windows.

03:43:05
<transcript>: okay

03:43:06
<transcript>: Okay.

03:43:10
<transcript>: It's a beta level of readiness. Okay.

03:43:12
zappy_oc: alacritty doesn't support ligatures yet

03:43:16
<transcript>: I'd like to make it my daily driver, whatever I choose here.

03:43:16
laytanl_: I just did `brew install --cask alacritty`

03:43:21
<transcript>: Let's see, kind of just brew install alacrity, that'd be cool.

03:43:27
<transcript>: Do I install on Mac.

03:43:29
<transcript>: Facian installation.

03:43:32
<transcript>: Prebuilt binaries for Mac OS and windows.

03:43:32
<transcript>: everyone else

03:43:37
<transcript>: Everyone else detail instructions can be found here. Okay, I bet I can't just brew, install it right.

03:43:37
<transcript>: cargo

03:43:39
<transcript>: Cargo installation.

03:43:45
<transcript>: See dependencies prerequisites. I have to have prerequisites. Is that true.

03:43:47
<transcript>: Bruce.

03:43:51
<transcript>: Install.

03:43:51
<transcript>: lacready

03:43:53
<transcript>: Lacready set of things.

03:43:54
laytanl_: just brew it

03:43:55
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:43:58
<transcript>: Any reason I shouldn't do this.

03:44:01
<transcript>: Bruinsaw Cast. Cool. Yeah, just brew it.

03:44:01
<transcript>: flaton says

03:44:03
<transcript>: Flaton says, Just brew it.

03:44:06
<transcript>: Blatant.

03:44:09
<transcript>: Is as quickly.

03:44:09
<transcript>: becoming

03:44:10
<transcript>: Becoming.

03:44:10
<transcript>: authority

03:44:14
<transcript>: Authority around here. Laden says it. I believe it.

03:44:21
<transcript>: Doesn't support Ligatures yet. So what? What ligatures do I care about.

03:44:24
<transcript>: Like if I look at my.

03:44:31
<transcript>: Even do I even have lingatures in this font? I don't know if I do.

03:44:38
<transcript>: Like, no, I don't, right. That would be a ligature if I had ligatures, and I don't have them.

03:44:40
<transcript>: Adam and vs. Code.

03:44:43
<transcript>: Not too upset about missing them, though I think I could live without them.

03:44:43
<transcript>: if it's fast

03:44:47
<transcript>: If it's faster if it's blazingly fast.

03:44:47
<transcript>: then

03:44:49
<transcript>: Then I don't even care.

03:45:09
<transcript>: We're still waiting on brew every time I do? Oh, it's done. I think I was just scrolling up.

03:45:13
<transcript>: Alacradula. Successfully installed. Okay.

03:45:16
<transcript>: Can I just run it? Install alacrity.

03:45:21
<transcript>: Let's go back here. I guess I can just run it now.

03:45:26
<transcript>: Alacrity app. Here it is. It's the last.

03:45:31
<transcript>: Bigger.

03:45:33
<transcript>: Like so.

03:45:33
<transcript>: okay

03:45:34
<transcript>: Okay.

03:45:36
<transcript>: And Let's.

03:45:43
<transcript>: Go so this has all my history already let's go CD.

03:45:49
<transcript>: Yeah, it has all my history. Oh, that's fish. Yeah. So in vim.

03:45:54
<transcript>: But what are we missing? We're missing font. Our fonts is bad.

03:46:01
<transcript>: We just need.

03:46:01
<transcript>: better

03:46:06
<transcript>: Better font support, so there's no tabs, right. Alacrid is famously very simple.

03:46:06
<transcript>: no tabs

03:46:08
<transcript>: No tabs.

03:46:11
<transcript>: It just open new instances of it, right.

03:46:15
<transcript>: Okay. We're just gonna minimize this for now.

03:46:15
<transcript>: so

03:46:19
<transcript>: So we need to update our font. Let's see. Alacrity.

03:46:23
<transcript>: How do we configure? Alacrity, I guess I should read the README, install.

03:49:49
<transcript>: it's maybe a good call

03:50:26
<transcript>: We're gonna play with it.

03:50:34
<transcript>: What else did you, Layton? Could you give me, like, a TLDR on like what did you change about this config from the default.

<transcript>: i'm just curious

03:50:35
<transcript>: I'm just curious.

03:50:42
<transcript>: If there's like, oh, this is cool. Shows you all their key binding Mac OS only command.

<transcript>: So term what's the what's this about.

03:51:23
<transcript>: This values uses that the term environment really for each instance of Alacrity if it is not present, alcredi Alacrity will check the local term info database and use Alikrity if it is available. Otherwise X turned to color is used.

03:51:27
<transcript>: Okay.

03:51:29
laytanl_: I don't really know, but I had that in Iterm

03:51:36

backkflipp: Do

03:56:15
<transcript>: The folder doesn't exist. No. Is there not a way to save.

03:56:15
<transcript>: so

03:56:17
matejbendik: touch

03:56:17
<transcript>: So like them.

03:56:17
<transcript>: save

03:56:20
<transcript>: Save new file in new directory.

03:56:23
<transcript>: Touch. I should touched it.

03:56:26
<transcript>: Your file be saved.

03:56:33
<transcript>: This is what I'm looking for.

03:56:36
<transcript>: No, it's not.

03:56:42
<transcript>: Okay. I guess I could just make the directory first.

03:56:48
<transcript>: So we could just do kind of just run arbitrary stuff.

03:56:49
matejbendik: touch file_name will create new file in bash terminal

03:56:52
<transcript>: Use run arbitrary like bash commands here.

03:56:54
<transcript>: Touch.

03:56:56
backkflipp: Yes... just create folder manually

03:56:57
<transcript>: And do this.

03:57:02
<transcript>: For.

03:57:05
<transcript>: Config online.

03:57:12

<transcript>: Okay.

03:57:19
<transcript>: okay

03:57:21
<transcript>: Okay.

03:57:22
backkflipp: You need to do mkdir

03:57:25
<transcript>: Let's just do this, then.

03:57:34
<transcript>: I don't know how to make a new one. I just do like command T to make new tabs in iterm. I can't do that anymore. I guess I just have to open.

03:57:37
<transcript>: A LaCrate again.

03:57:40
<transcript>: I need to make a shortcut for that. Probably.

03:57:42
<transcript>: Oh, it didn't open a new one.

03:57:42
<transcript>: all equity

03:57:44
<transcript>: All equity.

<transcript>: Options.

03:57:52
<transcript>: How do I run it again.

03:58:01
<transcript>: You just create folder manually. Yeah, I will. If I can ever make a new instance of Velacrity. How do I do that.

03:58:06
<transcript>: Mac OS Run Alacrity twice.

03:58:06
joshfinnie: time for tmux too :-)

03:58:08
laytanl_: I added this to yabai:ctrl + alt + cmd - r: launchctl kickstart -k "gui/${UID}/homebrew.mxcl.yabai"

03:58:12
<transcript>: Wait a minute, tell me you can do this right.

03:58:17
<transcript>: I don't have to only ever work in one.

03:58:17

<transcript>: Oh, it does work.

03:58:22
<transcript>: okay

03:58:23
laytanl_: whoops wrong one

03:58:25
backkflipp: hahaha

03:58:26
<transcript>: Okay. Cool. So command in opens a new one.

03:58:30
<transcript>: I gotta set the default file font size.

03:58:30
<transcript>: because

03:58:31
<transcript>: Because that's small.

03:58:35
<transcript>: Okay. I want to do touch.

03:58:38
<transcript>: Big alacrity.

03:58:46
backkflipp: noo

03:58:47

nexxeln: yay alacritty

03:58:59
<transcript>: alacrity

03:59:01
<transcript>: Alacrity to close a window.

03:59:05
<transcript>: Need to learn all the lacquer to come in, I guess.

<transcript>: Okay. I want to get the default.

04:00:19
matejbendik: nvim file_name will create new file and jump to that file

04:00:20
<transcript>: The default thing.

04:00:21
nexxeln: tmux is great

04:00:22
<transcript>: Where's the config.

04:00:28
<transcript>: Lacredita fish.

04:00:32
<transcript>: What's? That? I use fish.

04:00:35
<transcript>: Here we go, YAML.

04:00:45
thechosenone1080: i just use kitty's split terminal instead of tmux

04:00:47
backkflipp: The usual "easy" way to do that type of stuff is use tree (file explorer) to create folders and files.

04:00:50
faiataiga: heyo! Also tmux is the best :P

04:00:51
<transcript>: Ignore that Laden. Okay, I'm ignoring that.

04:00:52
thechosenone1080: better than learning more shortcuts

04:00:56
<transcript>: Tmux is great. I just use Kitty split terminal instead of tmux.

04:01:05
<transcript>: What is split Terminal? The usual easy way to do that type of stuff is use tree to create folders and files. Yeah, that's the easy way for sure.

04:01:07
<transcript>: Welcome.

04:01:12
<transcript>: Fetega, welcome to Chat. I like when new people show up in chat.

04:01:18
<transcript>: Tmux is the best. I have heard a lot of things. Team X has a very passionate community.

04:01:18
<transcript>: and

04:01:21
<transcript>: And a lot of people think teamucks is great.

04:01:23
thechosenone1080: kitty has most things tmux has but way easier to use

04:01:26
<transcript>: Better than learning more shortcuts. Yeah, no, I get it. Split, split, terminal.

04:01:31
backkflipp: Tmux is really good for Mac.

04:01:35
<transcript>: Kitty has most things team outs has but way easier to use. Oh, you're talking about Kitty.

04:01:40
<transcript>: Sorry. I forgot what Kitty was you're talking about the other term instead of alacrity.

04:01:43
<transcript>: Yeah, I just don't.

04:01:49
backkflipp: On linux we usually use Window Manangers so there is no such need.

04:01:50
<transcript>: I kind of feel like I'd rather go the more like Eunuchs Linux approach of like tool that does one thing.

04:01:56
<transcript>: And allocrite seems to be that alacrity. And then learning Pmux seems like a natural evolution.

04:02:01
<transcript>: Okay, we got a YAML file somewhere. Where's the YAML file.

04:02:01
<transcript>: this is it

04:02:06
<transcript>: This is it right here. So these are all the Daunts. We're gonna just copy the whole thing.

04:02:11
<transcript>: We're gonna come in here, and I already paste it. Did I already do this.

04:02:11
<transcript>: no

04:02:13
<transcript>: No, I didn't.

04:02:15
<transcript>: But I'm confused.

04:02:17
<transcript>: And confused.

04:02:25
<transcript>: It should be empty. That's what I was expecting. Okay, here's all the defaults.

04:02:31
thechosenone1080: mac also has yabai for window manager

04:02:33
<transcript>: Let's go to the top, let's comment everything. So we're gonna do visual mode. Actually, we're just gonna.

04:02:39
<transcript>: Just do yeah, we'll just do visual.

04:02:42
backkflipp: Although tmux is really good when connecting through ssh

04:02:42
<transcript>: And then go to the bottom.

04:02:45
<transcript>: And then we'll do.

04:02:49
<transcript>: Comment.

04:02:53
<transcript>: And then.

04:02:53
<transcript>: back to top

04:02:54
<transcript>: Back to top.

04:02:57
<transcript>: So we will uncomment these.

04:03:04
<transcript>: And then window, we're gonna uncommon window.

04:03:04
<transcript>: button

04:03:08
laytanl_: I had a file that was already commented and had descriptions for everything

04:03:08
<transcript>: Buttonless sounds cool. I guess if it's default, I should leave it default.

04:03:12
<transcript>: Right? Is this why latent? Looks like this.

04:03:16
<transcript>: This is why lightning click like this.

04:03:18
<transcript>: Regret.

04:03:22
<transcript>: Oh Nope Nope Nope.

04:03:28
thechosenone1080: yeah it should come with it

04:03:31
<transcript>: This is why it looks like that. And I should have just trusted you latent. I was like, why is it all weird.

04:03:31
<transcript>: what's wrong

04:03:34
<transcript>: What's wrong here. And that's why.

04:03:34
<transcript>: that is

04:03:35
<transcript>: That is why.

04:03:37
thechosenone1080: or there should just be a option to generate one

04:03:45
<transcript>: Okay. Scrolling. I'm just leaving all these default default padding. I'd like to be less than that.

04:03:51
backkflipp: @thechosenone1080 Yead but most people dont use it...

04:03:54
<transcript>: In fact, I might like zero padding.

04:04:01
<transcript>: What? I like zero padding? I think I might like zero padding.

04:04:01
<transcript>: call me crazy

04:04:02
<transcript>: Call me crazy.

04:04:06
<transcript>: Call me crazy but we're going zero.

04:04:09
thechosenone1080: maybe idk

04:04:11
thechosenone1080: never use mac

04:04:13

<transcript>: what do i have

04:04:20
<transcript>: What do I have in my eye? Term.

04:04:20
thechosenone1080: i use arch btw

04:04:22
<transcript>: What is my ipad font size.

04:04:24
laytanl_: 0 is default for padding

04:04:28
<transcript>: Is this I term I don't even know anymore I'm so confused.

<transcript>: and then

04:04:39
<transcript>: And then text.

04:04:41
<transcript>: 32.

04:04:45
<transcript>: 32 font size. Okay.

04:04:47
<transcript>: Simple.

04:04:55
<transcript>: I don't know why. Just the word classic. This came into my mind. And it was in the Teachers Voice classic.

04:04:55
<transcript>: classic

04:04:57
<transcript>: Classic.

04:05:01
<transcript>: Zero is default for padding. Oh, it is.

04:05:01
<transcript>: oh

04:05:02
<transcript>: Oh.

04:05:02
<transcript>: why

<transcript>: All the cool people use arch.

04:05:15
<transcript>: architect

04:05:16
<transcript>: Architect.

04:05:19
backkflipp: I use a script to inc/dec the font size within alacritty, to make it permanent if needed.

04:05:22
<transcript>: Yeah I don't know do a lot of SSHing anymore backflip.

04:05:27
<transcript>: I don't do a lot of that anymore. I don't do a lot of servers.

04:05:27
<transcript>: most

04:05:29
<transcript>: Mostly serverless.

04:05:33
thechosenone1080: yes i belong to the cool club üòé

04:05:40
laytanl_: What you have open are not the defaults

04:05:41
<transcript>: Use a script to increase decrease the font size within Alacrity to make it permanent if needed.

04:05:49
laytanl_: right?

04:05:49
<transcript>: You do belong to the Cool Club? Yeah, no, my friend dad. He came on and taught me Neove him on stream few weeks ago. He's his art.

04:05:51
<transcript>: Clinics.

04:05:59
faiataiga: i use Fedora ftw @thechosenone1080 :P

04:06:01
<transcript>: What you have open are not the defaults, right? Well, they're supposed to be. Oh, clearly not, though JetBrain's Mono would not be the default. What.

04:06:10
<transcript>: What am I looking at? I'm looking. I'm not looking at the defaults. No, these are the defaults. No.

04:06:10
<transcript>: these

04:06:14
<transcript>: These also aren't the defaults. Well, I just was here and I just clicked on.

04:06:17
<transcript>: Oh, it downloaded it.

04:06:18
laytanl_: https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/releases/download/v0.10.1/alacritty.yml

04:06:19
backkflipp: I'm on Arch but you should use if it makes your life easier, not harder.

04:06:21
<transcript>: I'm sorry Everyone, this is the default.

04:06:26
<transcript>: These are the defaults makes way more sense now.

04:06:26
<transcript>: okay

04:06:28
<transcript>: Okay, let's try again.

04:06:32
<transcript>: Try again third time is a charm.

04:06:35
<transcript>: V.

04:06:40
<transcript>: We want to delete all that.

04:06:44
thechosenone1080: never Syu on arch

04:06:45
<transcript>: And then paste. Copy this one. I'm gonna copy all this again.

04:06:49
<transcript>: And then paste it. Okay.

04:06:50
thechosenone1080: NEVA

04:06:52
<transcript>: Now we're looking at some defaults, right.

04:06:52
<transcript>: yes

04:06:53
<transcript>: Yes.

04:06:56
<transcript>: Oh, man.

04:06:56
<transcript>: somebody

04:06:59
<transcript>: Somebody tries. Okay, any items in the entry.

04:07:03
<transcript>: So we're gonna do this.

04:07:10
<transcript>: I don't know if I need to mess with this or if it's just gonna use the right thing by default.

04:07:13
<transcript>: Term environment variable.

04:07:13
<transcript>: for each

04:07:16
<transcript>: For each instance of operators not present. Alec.

04:07:22
<transcript>: X term 256 color? I don't know. I don't know what I want here, so I'm just gonna leave it.

04:07:24
<transcript>: Excluded.

04:07:24
<transcript>: window

04:07:26
<transcript>: Window.

04:07:28
<transcript>: I have opinions yet on that you know.

04:07:31
<transcript>: Dimensions.

04:07:34
<transcript>: Okay, so padding is zero.

04:07:34
<transcript>: right here

04:07:34
backkflipp: You should always do Syu

04:07:35
<transcript>: Right here.

04:07:38
<transcript>: Full window position.

04:07:41
backkflipp: You should never do Sy

04:07:46
<transcript>: Dynamic padding is false. Spread additional padding evenly around the terminal content. You don't want any padding so that's fine.

04:07:49
<transcript>: Values for decorations.

04:07:54
<transcript>: True decorations full.

04:07:56
joshfinnie: i'd recommend x-term-256color if you're using vim in the browser? not sure if there's anything vim will do with a term of alacritty

04:07:59
<transcript>: Orders and Title bar.

04:07:59
<transcript>: values

04:08:02
<transcript>: Values decorations macros only transparent.

04:08:02
<transcript>: buttonless

04:08:03
<transcript>: Buttonless.

04:08:09
<transcript>: One of our transparent background and no title bar, buttons.

04:08:13
<transcript>: How do I feel about that.

04:08:17
<transcript>: I'm gonna leave it for now. Background Opacity is one.

04:08:17
<transcript>: startup

04:08:19
<transcript>: Startup mode.

04:08:27
<transcript>: Simple full screen windowed is probably best. Okay window title liquidy. Okay.

04:08:31
<transcript>: Dynamic Titles that sounds good. Window class. No.

04:08:35
<transcript>: Seem variant.

04:08:38
<transcript>: Strolling.

04:08:43
<transcript>: Here we go first time I care font.

04:08:43
<transcript>: normal

04:08:44
<transcript>: Normal.

04:08:44
<transcript>: bold

04:08:46
<transcript>: Bold.

04:08:50
<transcript>: What is it? The size.

04:08:55
<transcript>: I want to get to that before I forget. So this is 32.

04:08:59
<transcript>: Font family.

04:09:06
<transcript>: So we got to set these fonts so normal is going to be.

04:09:06
<transcript>: a font

04:09:09
<transcript>: A font family of.

04:09:11
<transcript>: What did we say it was.

04:09:18
<transcript>: Operator Monoun font.

04:09:18
<transcript>: geez

04:09:20
<transcript>: Geez.

04:09:20
<transcript>: here we go

04:09:22
<transcript>: Here we go. Operate.

04:09:25
<transcript>: Mono. Nerd. Font.

04:09:35
<transcript>: Style regular is going to be style. Oh can we set side to pick a specific face so this is going to be book.

04:09:38
<transcript>: I believe that's accurate.

04:09:43
<transcript>: Book and book italic.

04:09:45
<transcript>: So actually.

04:09:45
<transcript>: my nerd

04:09:52
<transcript>: My nerd fought patched operator mono doesn't have ligatures, so I'm not gonna miss that at all because I literally don't have it in my font.

04:09:57
<transcript>: Bold we're gonna say same family operator.

04:09:57
<transcript>: mono

04:10:00
<transcript>: Mono. Nerd. Font.

04:10:03
backkflipp: You patched it?

04:10:05
<transcript>: Style? I guess there's just gonna be no bold she's gonna be.

04:10:09
<transcript>: Alec is going to be.

04:10:12
<transcript>: Same operator.

04:10:12
<transcript>: oh

04:10:13
<transcript>: Oh.

04:10:18
<transcript>: Operator Monoun font.

04:10:21

04:10:35
<transcript>: Operator Mono Nerd font.

04:10:39
<transcript>: Is book italic maybe I need to download.

04:10:39
<transcript>: an operator

04:10:49
<transcript>: An operator model that I don't think so. I don't think so. Tim Offset is the extra space around each character. Don't need that. Don't need that then stroke Font rendering.

04:10:49
<transcript>: suitable

04:10:57
<transcript>: Suitable for written displays. The yes, we want that news builtin font for box drawing characters. Okay.

04:11:07
<transcript>: Okay, colors. Let's get our we have a colors somewhere. We downloaded it. It's in Finder.

04:11:10
backkflipp: I'm using monolisa right now after using jetbrains mono for years. I think Ill try operator because of you...

04:11:19
<transcript>: Finder Dracula. Yaml. I don't know what this is. Code. Over here.

04:11:26
<transcript>: So we're gonna delete everything in the colors.

04:11:28
<transcript>: And do this.

04:11:28
<transcript>: cursor color

04:11:34
<transcript>: Cursor colors, Z mode, Cursor all these colors out of here.
