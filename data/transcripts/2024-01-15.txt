pbertrand_dev: coach tell him to bring more water next time because water is the foundation of everything and if you run out you are screwed

00:14:02
pirazgg: I think you are too tall and you are too standing up. You should try to reach some collar behind the guys back at the beginning

00:14:16
dmdboi: Now spin kick

00:14:18
bulowking: @pbertrand_dev Are you saying adam is the waterboy?

dmdboi: Uppercut

00:14:26
dmdboi: Suplex

00:15:26
pirazgg: The spider was too dangerous, the arms were too opened during the clash standing up

00:15:49
oetziofficial: hello!

texoport: shovels, yep

00:18:33
texoport: more of a pickaxe guy myself, but sure

00:19:16
pbertrand_dev: I feel like adam should try to be shorter to change his center of gravity so hes more stable

00:19:25
pbertrand_dev: take off a few inches

00:19:56
bulowking: @adamdotdev Move camera to top right corner?

00:20:13
pbertrand_dev: hes ignoring chat, he only cares about BJJ and vegan food now

00:20:20
bulowking: D:

00:20:26
pirazgg: P)

00:21:09
texoport: @pbertrand_dev he didn't even mention RSCs once, sadge

00:21:56
loige: rscs will immediately make any opponent tap

00:22:48
moussx_: Sadge the cam placement is blocking us

00:22:55
weloy: We can't see shit

00:23:09
texoport: all we can see is adam's head getting squished by a dude

00:23:29
moussx_: Heâ€™ll see when he takes a break I guess

00:24:36
pbertrand_dev: I tried to warn him but no dice

00:24:44
itsmeleague: Lol

00:24:54
pirazgg: but Adam those positions make you spend too much energy, this is the first match

00:24:59
texoport: this is like modeling clay but the clay models you back

00:25:04
oetziofficial: put the camera on the top paybe?

00:25:36
moussx_: top right will be better

00:25:51
pbertrand_dev: its BJJ and adam, hes used to being on the bottom LOL

pbertrand_dev: Kappa

00:26:11
moussx_: Itâ€™ll be fun when they roll over to the right side Kappa

00:26:51
pirazgg: the guy was gassed right now

00:27:17
pbertrand_dev: does the suit color mean anything or is it a fashion statement

00:27:35
pirazgg: I think that was the second time , you missed to go North South

00:27:39
hicat_pl: and now they on the right side

pirazgg: he should make people try to carry him

00:29:55
pirazgg: nice dude

00:30:42
pbertrand_dev: we need to train some raw agression too, we need to release the tiger

00:30:48
pirazgg: when standup, go less 90 degress, you are too high not that wide on the feet

dashcraft1989: 100% agree with your coach here, getting underneath is a game of inches gotta keep bumping until you're under the hips
