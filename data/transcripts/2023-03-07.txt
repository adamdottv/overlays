11:22:40
<transcript>: just learning

11:22:43
<transcript>: Just learning facts about space and sometimes.

11:22:43
<transcript>: i'll learn

11:22:49
<transcript>: I'll learn some just insane fact about the size of our universe.

11:22:49
<transcript>: just

11:22:54
<transcript>: Just how the scale of things is so far beyond what you could ever imagine.

11:22:59
<transcript>: Start thinking about the tiny spec that I am that I occupy.

11:22:59
<transcript>: the

11:23:03
<transcript>: The tiny speck of space and time that I'll occupy.

11:23:03
<transcript>: from in my life

11:23:04
<transcript>: From in my life.

11:23:11
<transcript>: And then I think about how I spend most of my time just.

11:23:11
<transcript>: floating around

11:23:12
<transcript>: Floating around.

11:23:12
<transcript>: trying

11:23:15
<transcript>: Trying to get little glimpses of my reflection.

11:23:15
<transcript>: in this

11:23:18
<transcript>: In this vast sea of other specs.

11:23:23
<transcript>: Just to maybe get a sense.

11:23:28
<transcript>: To maybe understand a little bit more about.

11:23:28
<transcript>: who i

11:23:30
<transcript>: Who I am Why I'm here.

11:23:35
<transcript>: The space that I occupy, what I bring to this world.

11:23:40
<transcript>: Oh, my notification? I fix my nose? My notifications.

11:23:44
<transcript>: Oh, yeah? I fixed my follower notifications.

<transcript>: oh yeah

11:23:48
<transcript>: Oh, yeah? I fix my follower notifications.

11:24:22
<transcript>: Oh, yeah? I fixed my follower notifications.

11:27:31
<transcript>: Sun's gotten really into space lately. So we're reading a lot of space books, and he's learning all kinds of cool facts. And I learn so many new facts about space.

11:27:31
<transcript>: there's

11:27:37
<transcript>: There's always some crazy fact learn about how giant.

11:27:37
<transcript>: some celest

11:27:37
<transcript>: Some celestial bot.

11:27:44
<transcript>: And it just reminds you how tiny, just how tiny we are in this.

11:27:44
<transcript>: maybe

11:27:46
<transcript>: Maybe infinite unit universe.

11:27:46
<transcript>: and

11:27:54
<transcript>: And I start thinking about just the spec of space and time that I'll occupy in my entire life here.

11:27:56
<transcript>: And.

11:27:56
<transcript>: how

11:27:58
<transcript>: How really.

11:27:58
<transcript>: i send most

11:28:01
<transcript>: I send most of my time just trying to get a little glimpse.

11:28:01
<transcript>: of

11:28:03
<transcript>: Of my reflection.

11:28:03
<transcript>: and all the

11:28:10
<transcript>: And all the other specs that I surround myself with just to try to maybe understand a little better.

11:28:10
<transcript>: why

11:28:12
<transcript>: Why I'm here.

11:28:15
<transcript>: What part I play in all of this.

11:28:20

cowfacedude99: Double swards LUL

00:12:27
nexxeln: W mods

00:12:29
ohmymndy: So how are the ideas coming along for the expensive Mac?

00:13:09
binajmen: I was wondering during yesterday stream what is the best approach to switch from vs code to neovim? any resources I should look at?

00:15:03
cowfacedude99: @binajmen honestly? just start using. there's kickstart.nvim

00:15:15
aj_stuyvenberg: Teej's kickstart is awesome, I still use neovim with mostly that configuration.

00:15:26
binajmen: great ty :)

00:16:00
mattmancodes: lspzero

00:16:00
cowfacedude99: lsp-zero is nice

00:17:08
meranofox: this camera never ceases to amaze me

00:17:19
aj_stuyvenberg: also ripgrep is amazing

00:17:42
cowfacedude99: ripgrep and fd-find

00:17:44
aj_stuyvenberg: It's a rust-based replacement for ack/silver-searcher

00:17:49
aj_stuyvenberg: used to find text really quickly

00:17:56
daglee: ripgrepis what telescope uses by default (if installed)

00:18:01
mattmancodes: you probably use it with telescope

00:18:02
aj_stuyvenberg: Yup

00:18:22
aj_stuyvenberg: lmao true

00:18:40
aj_stuyvenberg: no the teaser was nice and the end made me laugh

00:18:48
cowfacedude99: I love how things can integrate with neovim.

00:20:01
cowfacedude99: one day we will get you to use nixos LUL

00:20:22
cowfacedude99: nope.

00:20:24
nexxeln: no

00:20:43
cowfacedude99: https://nixos.org/

00:20:53
ohmymndy: It is declarative. Everything is as code

00:21:02
tayloreddev: its also a package manager

00:21:12
meranofox: Since I found out about homemanger from nix I will be switching soon https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager

00:21:28
meranofox: to manage my shell stuff

00:21:54
meranofox: haha no

00:21:54
cowfacedude99: manjaro?

00:22:12
mattmancodes: almost

00:22:32
cowfacedude99: I had it running on my parent's laptop for a while. worked like charm

00:23:03
cowfacedude99: it is a rabbit hole.

00:23:12
cowfacedude99: it is the world outside vscode LUL

00:23:15
meranofox: btw I'm on macOS but I can still use nix to just manage my things. It's like a replacement for homebrew

00:23:26
aj_stuyvenberg: i3 on the arch machine?

00:23:32
aj_stuyvenberg: I assume so, if Dax talked you into it.

00:23:42
cowfacedude99: I also use nix on wsl.

00:23:53
aj_stuyvenberg: lol checks out.

00:23:56
meranofox: my coworker has a interesting example: https://gist.github.com/nickrttn/28acb67356c77b838493f31a6286fc03

00:24:07
meranofox: I'm facinated by the fact that you manage the SETTINGS of your tools there too

00:24:11
dinisskizee: Hey Adam! Came by to say hello, working atm xD

00:24:21
cowfacedude99: windows subsystem for linux or something

00:24:22
cowfacedude99: A

00:24:31
cowfacedude99: a few points more...

00:24:34
meranofox: no it's an example

00:24:37
ohmymndy: That's a great gist!

00:24:51
cowfacedude99: and I can force you to share your screen LUL

00:25:12
cowfacedude99: and corporate loves windows/macos.

00:25:21
andom: @cowfacedude99 exactly

00:25:23
bubakek: @cowfacedude99 this

00:25:24
ohmymndy: Using windows everywhere with Linux VMS on them.

00:25:27
cowfacedude99: nobody forces linux on devs.

00:25:53
andom: I use windows but do almost everything on wsl

00:26:08
adamdotdev: !discord

00:26:08
fossabot: Adam has a Discord server and he'd love to see you there: https://discord.gg/E92M2chd3e

00:26:14
cowfacedude99: better make a channel on discord.

texoport: oh sick, haven't made it to an adam stream in forever

00:28:40
kisancodes: oh hello there :D

00:29:05

00:31:23
meranofox: such a fan culture

00:31:35
thdxr: I'm gonna go play with my dog for 30min then can I join stream

00:31:50
brainzman: @meranofox idk I would say its more of a Haskell

00:31:57
assertionbit: Oh no, nx. I was having a bad time trying to include it in existing monorepo

00:31:59
cowfacedude99: @MeranoFox If that is the case, than I am finally on a hype LUL

00:32:08
thdxr: I use nix inside arch lol

00:32:17
meranofox: @thdxr NotLikeThis

00:32:20
brainzman: Crazy fan culture but still pretty underground

00:33:20

texoport: tedious af dx

00:33:48
cowfacedude99: agree

00:33:55
thdxr: would be 1000x more popular

00:33:58
brainzman: Do you use only macos or do you use run some sort or linux vm for your neovim

00:34:06
brainzman: i saw quite a lot of people do that recently

00:34:10
cowfacedude99: @Brainzman only mac

00:35:20

caelic01: process of multiple elimination

00:36:54
caelic01: because eliminating the same command multiple times

00:37:03

00:38:02
kociqq: Welcome back ayezeePoggers

00:38:10
cowfacedude99: there's last session that I use a lot. you will have to map to a keybind though.

00:38:42
cowfacedude99: A lot of the stuff for tmux is make yourself.

00:38:59
texoport: what are you using for when you need interactivity?

13:45:48
<transcript>: Okay.

13:45:48
<transcript>: when you

13:46:14
<transcript>: Okay.

13:46:46
<transcript>: I'm gonna be honest. I didn't hear that part.

13:46:50
<transcript>: Because I was copying my camera over here.

13:46:53
<transcript>: Because I'm the narcissist. Okay.

13:46:55
<transcript>: Give me that part again.

13:47:01
sondreal: LUL

13:47:07
tiredbeaver: dax is dying internally

13:47:14
laytanl_: "ok", "ok", wait I didn't listen

13:47:46
<transcript>: Okay.

13:47:49
<transcript>: I don't do a lot of trpc.

13:47:49
<transcript>: so it's still

13:47:53
<transcript>: So it's still so foreign zod and trpc still looks so weird to me.

13:47:57
<transcript>: Like they just look weird. Yeah.

13:48:07
<transcript>: You should probably write all the business logic. I don't know if I know what that word means.

13:48:07
<transcript>: those

13:48:10
<transcript>: Those words. Business logic.

13:48:15
<transcript>: Got it then that makes more sense.

13:48:47
<transcript>: Right just need to know that their user they have about session.

13:48:58
<transcript>: Okay.

13:49:03
<transcript>: Much is this much just save that in there.

13:49:03
<transcript>: just

13:49:04
<transcript>: Just.

13:49:04
<transcript>: wives just leave that in

13:49:06
<transcript>: Wives. Just leave that in there.

13:49:06

13:49:08
texoport: ooh, expose() is nifty

13:49:24
southqt: lgtm

13:49:25
<transcript>: What is this? Stream? Url.

13:49:25
<transcript>: oh so

13:49:28
<transcript>: Oh, so we do the jot token thing.

13:49:33
<transcript>: No, that's actually the url that ivs needs.

13:49:42
<transcript>: Like we that doesn't get used by anything we do that's literally the URL that you hit with the player can hit to view the video.

13:49:54
<transcript>: Oh, like we could do something with that information in IBS.

13:50:10
<transcript>: Well, that is a good point though. Like it'd be helpful to know who's actually watching the stream or how I guess just how many people even I bet IBS that stuff built in for that.

13:50:12
<transcript>: Right.

13:50:47
<transcript>: Yeah, that'd be good. I thought. Did you already do the authent points? You want to meet.

13:50:47
<transcript>: like some

13:50:49
<transcript>: Like some ounce stuff.

13:50:49
<transcript>: in the mobile

13:50:50
<transcript>: In the mobile app.

13:51:10
<transcript>: How do people do so when you say this is like a common pattern. And I know I've seen it like the web view thing. How do people do off native and mobile.

13:51:14
<transcript>: Like without that without a browser, redirect or something.

13:51:27
<transcript>: Just for mobile.

13:51:32
<transcript>: Okay.

13:51:43
<transcript>: Thank you for the fallen abigy.

13:53:01
<transcript>: Can we.

13:53:02
<transcript>: How's that work.

13:53:07
<transcript>: Like you would just use Twilio or something to send.

13:53:09
<transcript>: An opcode.

13:53:13
<transcript>: I would already support it.

13:53:13
<transcript>: oh

nikolaxhristov: :D

<transcript>: So they okay. So if the initial onboarding. I'm just thinking about the onboarding experience. We first download rebase. I think I nice onboarding experience. We type in your phone number, and it doesn't have to load a webview. That sounds pretty cool.

13:53:56
<transcript>: if we could do that

13:53:57
<transcript>: If we could do that.

13:54:01
<transcript>: Oh Yeah.

13:54:01
<transcript>: so we'll

13:54:06
<transcript>: So we'll have to we'd have to have, like, ability to link.

13:54:06
<transcript>: after that is that possible

13:54:07
<transcript>: After that is that possible.

13:54:11
<transcript>: In. Ssd. Off to link. Okay.

<transcript>: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Because it ties to the email, okay. Yeah.

13:54:36
<transcript>: Okay.

13:54:38
aarrjaay: I ike it when Dax looks to his right when he's talking because it looks like he's in the same room as you - you just need to look slightly left to complete the picture :)

13:54:42
<transcript>: So I've just been working on the animations. That's all I've been thinking about right now.

13:54:48
<transcript>: But yeah, all the ivs stuff was working without off.

13:54:57
<transcript>: We should just like record rebase on stream. I'm sorry not rebase the other thing we do tomorrow.

13:54:57
<transcript>: we should just

13:55:01
<transcript>: We should just record our episodes on stream all the time. Would that be doable.

13:55:04
<transcript>: Yeah.

13:55:10
<transcript>: This is multitasking. I just the how many things can I do while I'm also streaming on Twitch.

13:55:20
<transcript>: I watch some. I think bash yesterday was like editing a YouTube video. That's such a good idea. I don't know why you people, why do you people want to watch people edit YouTube videos.

13:55:20

13:55:56
texoport: @privann clearly the line

13:55:57

13:56:01
<transcript>: Pravan makes sense.

13:56:03
laytanl_: probably gaming tbh

13:56:04
<transcript>: Clearly the line.

13:56:14
<transcript>: I actually thought about building. I'm got a keyboard to build another mode keyboard. I thought my stream would love that you guys would enjoy watching me build that right. I'll put a top down camera.

13:56:16
<transcript>: Build it out.

13:56:16
<transcript>: and like

13:56:17
southqt: code pairing with viewers

13:56:19
<transcript>: taught

13:56:22
laytanl_: I like the chill stuf

13:56:24
privann: TBH it's kinda interest, WHAT IF the poop is 5 cm and yellow and not 15 cm and brown

13:56:27
<transcript>: Taught. Probably gaming, to be honest. Late. And you wouldn't watch me game. I just played among us. It was pretty fun. Dax, when are we gonna play among us? I need to fix.

13:56:27
<transcript>: i mean

13:56:30
privann: it's kinda interesting

13:56:33
<transcript>: I mean I need to play a normal adjusted human game of.

13:56:33
<transcript>: among us because

<transcript>: Wow.

13:57:21
<transcript>: That is a really good idea.

13:57:27
texoport: that's actually briliant

13:57:28
privann: but 4 real. Just study times, focus time. I find these streams enjoying and good as even If I work from home do I still feel connected to other people as we are many people "working togheter" on schedule

13:57:36
privann: promodoro thing

13:57:37
<transcript>: So you're building a tool that does that.

13:57:44
<transcript>: Sounds awesome.

13:57:48
<transcript>: And when you say part three, or did they say part three.

13:57:51
<transcript>: So you've already you started on this on stream.

13:57:53
schrew: Oh I do that same thing dax! I give each little playlist a fun name, so I don't actually know when each era is tho

13:57:59
<transcript>: I feel like I've watched your streams lately. That's what I was getting at. It's. Like, how do I not know about part one and part two was. I did. I just not know what you were doing.

13:57:59

cowfacedude99: wait. is TRPC coming to sst?

13:59:02
<transcript>: Yeah. So I've been using the cli just to test like, I'm driving stuff in the ui now animations off of it. But yeah, you need if you could build out. Yeah. Get like a spa setup that we can start because it's just gonna be a web app, right? That will want to drive that like we have admin access to something.

13:59:10
<transcript>: Yeah, just json payload. Yeah, just a string.

13:59:15
<transcript>: How are you doing.

13:59:16
grasp5533: I'm on the docs, but I just don't get it lol

13:59:20

<transcript>: how are you gonna

13:59:22
texoport: get a *spa* set up. spa time with adam and dax?

13:59:28
<transcript>: How are you gonna do that's? Crazy. I don't even know where to start. My brain is like, it's just a string. How can you make it type of. But I know, you know, you'll figure it out.

13:59:31
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, yeah, right.

13:59:39
bronifty: He’s a magician

<transcript>: Yeah, it's perfect.

13:59:47
mattmancodes: typescript sits on the throne of lies

13:59:52
cowfacedude99: @Grasp5533 basically it is end to end type safety.

13:59:54
<transcript>: Yeah. I imagine like the admin app. You'll just have, like a big bank a questions, and you just select one to be like, ugue up or whatever.

13:59:54
<transcript>: and then hit a button

13:59:56
<transcript>: And then hit a button to say, next.

14:00:08
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:00:16
<transcript>: I thought about this. Yeah, everyone dies.

14:00:16
<transcript>: such

14:00:26
<transcript>: Such Mac. I thought about that. No. Like what do we if nobody makes it to the end? Is there just no winner that day? Do you just stop? Maybe just save the question.

14:00:26
<transcript>: so don't

14:00:28
<transcript>: So don't waste them.

14:00:32
<transcript>: Oh.

14:00:48

14:00:55
<transcript>: Okay.

14:01:01
<transcript>: Is that what you think? That's what hq tributed. I'm sure there were days where not everyone made it.

14:01:04
<transcript>: Or everyone didn't make it.

14:01:08
beeut: Is it quiz show about tech?

14:01:22

14:02:46
mjewl: chjbSit

14:02:48
<transcript>: I should have said it's good to see. Okay anyway.

14:02:51
<transcript>: Cool.

14:02:55
<transcript>: What else we got? I think we know what we need to do.

14:03:15
<transcript>: That's a great question. This is a question like when you do YouTube videos, how much do you script? There's different philosophies on this.

14:03:25
<transcript>: Word for word.

14:03:33
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:03:47
<transcript>: The tone is different.

14:03:55
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:04:05
<transcript>: And this is different than a YouTube video.

14:04:16
matty_twoshoes: mattyt25Lurk

14:04:26
<transcript>: Yeah, I can't make a coherent artument or like lay out anything valuable in a YouTube video. If I don't have the points already written out, I have to sit down and think about it.

14:04:31
<transcript>: So for this, though, it's really just the twelve questions.

14:04:31
<transcript>: h

14:04:34
<transcript>: Hq was hiring like comedians.

14:04:48
<transcript>: To be like the host and I'm not. I'm not funny if you had noticed axe so I don't know, like all the banter around each question. There needs to be banter. I don't know that you can prescript it and deliver it without sounding like a robot.

14:04:48
<transcript>: but it's

14:04:52
<transcript>: But it's the same time do you just, like, leave me when I'm the host.

14:04:55
<transcript>: To just say things because that sounds.

14:04:56
nikolaxhristov: @adamdotdev oh this is gonna be amazing

14:05:00
schrew: Highly recommend listening to this podcast (even for chat, it's interesting) https://www.theringer.com/2020/5/14/21258631/introducing-boom-bust-the-rise-and-fall-of-hq-trivia

14:05:07
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, probably as they write the joke.

14:05:08
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:05:13
<transcript>: That's a good point.

14:05:16
<transcript>: Yeah, Yeah.

14:05:20
<transcript>: Think about the Follow curling tea.

14:05:20
<transcript>: continue

14:05:22
<transcript>: Continue. Sorry.

14:05:35
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:05:35
<transcript>: i'm sure

14:05:56
<transcript>: I'm sure I'm gonna say other things that aren't on the script. I think if we could think of some things upfront that are fun that are like color, not just the facts of the questions. I think that would be helpful and like, kind of playing out, especially the first episode. I'm sure we're gonna want to like, really deliver on the script.

14:05:56
<transcript>: but then

14:06:01
theycallmesilvers: Knock knock jokes after every question or we riot

14:06:03
<transcript>: But then the question is like, is it a prompter? Is it moved at a certain pace? Like, we gotta build that too. Right.

14:06:15
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:06:21
<transcript>: I saw that.

14:06:29
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, we just stick with that for however many episodes. Twelve questions, twelve, not jokes.

14:06:39
matty_twoshoes: dad joke rate of 11 per 69 minutes

14:06:42
<transcript>: Yeah. I guess like the prompter side of it. I figured it's the same spa that we do all the producers using, but we just have a different view that has the question really big to see on a prompter.

14:06:42
<transcript>: and

14:06:54
<transcript>: And it also needs to have just some some numbers. Like how many people are watching? Just like when they call out stuff to make it. It feels live, right? It's so cold. My office. I gotta shut the window.

14:06:57
<transcript>: Continue. I can still hear you.

14:07:10
nikolaxhristov: I hope they get Misko for the jokes

14:07:24
nikolaxhristov: pff

14:07:30
nikolaxhristov: Misko Hevery has the best dad jokes

14:07:37
<transcript>: That's the topic I want to discuss. That.

14:07:40
nikolaxhristov: on a Ryan stream :X

14:07:44
<transcript>: You don't follow him.

14:07:46
<transcript>: So.

14:07:46
<transcript>: are we done talking

14:07:49
<transcript>: Are we done talking about rebates? Do we have anything else.

14:07:52
bronifty: Yes Misko is a comedian

14:07:53
<transcript>: Okay.

14:08:05
nikolaxhristov: and they're developer related

14:08:05
<transcript>: Yeah, perfect.

14:08:07
nikolaxhristov: just the best

14:08:08
<transcript>: With both my safety.

14:08:08
<transcript>: so cool

14:08:09
<transcript>: So, cool.

14:08:15
<transcript>: Okay. This is like a little mini tomorrow episode. And that's not really on our podcast, but.

14:08:15
<transcript>: it

14:08:25
<transcript>: It's something that affects my mental health and I need to say it and get it out there. You say you don't follow me scale would you call me sco appear.

14:08:34
<transcript>: Oh is peers about level? Okay.

14:08:41
<transcript>: Interest. So why don't you follow him? Sorry. I hope you don't mind this line of questioning.

14:08:59
<transcript>: So that's why. Okay. That's why you wouldn't follow somebody's if you've never seen a reason, you never had a reason to follow them.

14:09:17
<transcript>: Okay. Okay.

14:09:17
<transcript>: so

14:09:24
<transcript>: So. Okay. I'm gonna be very vulnerable here. This is gonna be raw, unfiltered, humanity.

14:09:24
<transcript>: for you

14:09:27
<transcript>: For you, twitch Viewers, and for DAX.

14:09:30
<transcript>: I get a little.

14:09:30
<transcript>: selfconscious

14:09:31
<transcript>: Selfconscious.

14:09:42
<transcript>: That selfconscious isn't the word bitters, not the word. There's an emotion. I'm just not good with emotions and names, but there's a feeling I get when I feel like there are peers.

14:09:42
<transcript>: even

14:09:43
aj_stuyvenberg: angsty

14:09:46
<transcript>: Even like close friends of close friends of mine.

14:09:46
<transcript>: that don't

14:09:48
<transcript>: That don't follow me.

14:09:48
<transcript>: and

14:09:56
<transcript>: And we interact a lot, and I can't figure out why. Why don't you follow me? It's the cheapest thing in the world. It falls them out on Twitter. And it makes me feel like.

14:09:56
<transcript>: there's something about

14:09:58
aj_stuyvenberg: lol yesssssssss

14:09:59
<transcript>: There's something about me they really don't like.

14:10:01
<transcript>: Does that make sense.

14:10:21
aj_stuyvenberg: twangst

14:10:26
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:10:28
beeut: For me is about numbers tbh, it should be round and not odd numbers sry i'm weird :D

14:10:33
nikolaxhristov: overprotective?

14:10:35
<transcript>: Okay. That makes me feel better.

14:10:40
<transcript>: Okay.

14:10:40
<transcript>: well

14:10:44
<transcript>: Well, I've got a list, like eight of them in my head right now. So.

14:10:44
<transcript>: that's still a lot of them though

14:10:48
<transcript>: That's still a lot of them, though. I feel mad about tragic jam. Thank you so much for the prime sub.

14:10:51
<transcript>: The Prime Sub I love it.

14:10:55
<transcript>: Yeah, there's seriously. There's probably like eight or ten people that.

14:11:01
<transcript>: Pull up their Twitter profile all the time.

14:11:01
<transcript>: just see if they're

14:11:09
<transcript>: Just see if they're following me. Yeah. It's like we're. I feel like we're peers. We know each other. We like, interact.

14:11:09
<transcript>: and

14:11:10
aj_stuyvenberg: don't those people know ADAM IS A HERO!?!

14:11:15
<transcript>: And like I feel like we're on good terms. And I can't figure out and like they'll reply to my tweets like this people that like.

14:11:15
<transcript>: they're

14:11:25
<transcript>: They're in our little orbit and they don't follow me. And I can't figure out like, it just makes me think about it all the time. Anytime I interact with them, I'm like, what do you not like about me? Why can't you just save my face.

14:11:25
<transcript>: sorry

14:11:27
<transcript>: Sorry I'm done.

14:11:37
laytanl_: They probably have no idea they aren't following

14:11:40
oskrm: howdy

14:11:48
imperialguard1: I'm 99% sure these guys aren't real humans, they're just AI creations. Nearly fooled me, nice try.

14:12:08
<transcript>: Well, that so those hurt words when it's somebody who's not when they follow, like, thousands of people like, I can't crack that list. What's going? Okay.

14:12:08
<transcript>: i gotta calm down

14:12:10
<transcript>: I gotta calm down I'm getting a little.

14:12:16
<transcript>: Aj said twinks. And I love that it's Twitter, angst.

14:12:25
<transcript>: Beet says for me it's about numbers. It should be around and not on number. I get that I have weird little quirks like that. Not that that's weird. But.

14:12:30
<transcript>: Don't those people know Adam is a hero? Exactly. No.

14:12:34
aj_stuyvenberg: dax is the anti-hero which may even be better

14:12:39
<transcript>: Probably have no idea they aren't following. That's. Nice for you to say latent. I'm gonna go with that. That's what dax said. Half of them. I can go with that. The other half just hate me.

14:12:39
<transcript>: ninety nine

14:12:41
sj_se: I dont follow certain people I like/know simply because of who they follow, because then the algos will start pushing me a ton of accounts im not interested in

14:12:50
<transcript>: 99%. Sure. Imperial Guard, welcome to Chat Nine episode. Sure. These guys aren't real humans. They're just AI Creations nearly fooled me. Nice. Dry. Who? Me and dax. Where AI creations.

14:12:56
<transcript>: Oh, we could be? I thought about making AI prime and theo. I started to even. I cloned bryan's voice.

14:12:56
<transcript>: yeah

14:12:58
<transcript>: Yeah, I know.

14:12:58
<transcript>: i know

14:13:00
oskrm: HYDRATE

14:13:05
<transcript>: I know I could make an AI prime in theo, but'em up on twitch 24/7.

14:13:09
<transcript>: Dax is the antihero, which may be even better. Definitely better.

14:13:09
<transcript>: i don't fall searching

14:13:13
<transcript>: I don't fall searching people. I like Flash. No. Simply because of who they follow.

14:13:13
<transcript>: because

14:13:21
<transcript>: Because then the algos will start pushing me a ton of accounts I'm not interested in. Interesting. I've thought about this. Is it that I like things.

14:13:21
<transcript>: and then

14:13:27
<transcript>: And then I want me to like, there's the things I like showing up in their feed. Maybe.

14:13:30
<transcript>: They wouldn't even know? Yeah Yeah.

14:13:39
matty_twoshoes: as soon as you put them up on twitch 24/7, they will start making some kind of hurtful / non-TOS joke and get banned. it's basically how it has to happen LUL

14:13:43
<transcript>: Is that why you unfold me on Twitter yesterday.

14:13:53
cowfacedude99: i see enough J and K from adam to vouch for him that he is not a AI creation LUL

14:14:01
<transcript>: My bed on that MADDIE'S here. As soon as you put them up on twitch 24/7, they will start making some kind of hurtful, non terms of hers joke and get banned.

14:14:01
<transcript>: basically how

14:14:05
bronifty: Kekw

14:14:06
<transcript>: Basically how it has to happen. So I wonder the what's his name? Atomos. No.

14:14:06
<transcript>: aid

14:14:15
<transcript>: Aid somebody. There's a guy, a streamer that did this. He made a bunch of AI streamers and put them on twitch 24/7. Did you see that ass.

14:14:19
nikolaxhristov: athene

14:14:19
<transcript>: Oh, I haven't seen Seinfeld.

14:14:27
matty_twoshoes: there have been a few examples so far, also with vtubers.

14:14:31
<transcript>: Oh, interesting, Yeah.

14:14:31
<transcript>: so it was

14:14:32
<transcript>: So it was.

14:14:32
<transcript>: this

14:14:32
matty_twoshoes: they all get banned eventually.

14:14:37
aj_stuyvenberg: The AI seinfeld one is hilarious, especially cause it went off the rails and got banned.

14:14:37
<transcript>: This one was the guy who made the asthma gold AI asmgal I forget his name.

14:14:43
<transcript>: A scene. Thank you, niko. A scene. So he had a channel in his.

14:14:46
<transcript>: Streamers that he had created.

14:14:46
<transcript>: and he's using

14:14:56
<transcript>: And he's using the like, forget the algo that does the like replaces the mouth. It takes a prerecorded video and just does the lip sync with the mouse.

14:15:05
<transcript>: It was a very convincing, but it's interesting that's coming. Isn't it like twitch is gonna be full of AI, vtubers and stuff.

14:15:12
<transcript>: I see enough J and K from Adam to vouch for him that he is not an AI creation.

14:15:12
<transcript>: what's

14:15:14
<transcript>: What's? Jane gay.

14:15:22
<transcript>: Is this something bad? Coffee.

14:15:36
<transcript>: There have been a few examples so far. Also, with youtubers. They all get banned eventually. Oh, interesting. I didn't know it was it that they say terrible things? Or is it having an AI personality on twitch against terms of service? It's self.

14:15:49
<transcript>: History of the twitch stuff. Oh, like, yeah, the prisoner, like, Had Prime. And like, all that. Yeah, I saw that one.

14:15:54
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:15:57
<transcript>: That's wild.

14:16:00
<transcript>: Kick him off.

14:16:00
<transcript>: yeah

14:16:03
<transcript>: Yeah. I thought that was weird. Yeah.

14:16:09
<transcript>: When are we? When are we gonna play among us and just be among us? Streamers.

14:16:10
matty_twoshoes: an AI itself isn't against TOS, but AI eventually does say something harmful, when it's generative...

14:16:13
<transcript>: I need a date and a time? Yeah.

14:16:13
cowfacedude99: neovim j and k. looks like you haven't using neovim enough adamdo8Ope

14:16:20
<transcript>: What's the sweet spot? I'm only played with ten people. What's the sweet spot of number of people.

14:16:22
bronifty: bashFrown

14:16:30
<transcript>: It was ten with two imposters.

14:16:33
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:16:42
schrew: KEKW @cowfacedude99

14:16:43
theycallmesilvers: 8, 2 killers is pretty nice

14:16:44
<transcript>: Sorry. I just saw cafes. Explained. What? Jane K. It's my neovic music.

14:17:07
<transcript>: I think six with one imposter could be fun. It's just hard to get ten people. The other thing that was the unfortunate thing about ten people is it's really hard to talk. Like you got ten people trying to like, the first meeting, everybody's still there. And it's like.

14:17:19
<transcript>: Yeah. And they all know exactly where they were. I was in the camera room. No, I was in the shield, and I went around stories, and then I came around really quick. And I just like, how do you know any of this stuff? You have to memorize the map.

14:17:23
<transcript>: Oh really.

14:17:23
<transcript>: you're on cam

14:17:27
<transcript>: You're on cams as they say, the among US crowd. Okay.

14:17:33
<transcript>: I can't wait to play with you because I can with the light of your face and just do it for fun.

14:17:33
laytanl_: Just say something and you're fine most of the time

14:17:37
<transcript>: Like I was doing my car task in the admin room.

14:17:37
<transcript>: andrea

14:17:40
<transcript>: Andrea, thank you for the follow.

14:17:40
laytanl_: Thats what I used to do

14:17:48
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:17:48
<transcript>: theo

14:17:54
<transcript>: Theo might be a sociopath. His ability to lie. He's so good at among us. Oh, my goodness.

14:17:57
<transcript>: Like he was really good.

14:18:00
<transcript>: But he said he said.

14:18:03
tiredbeaver: theo just has a lot of hours in that game

14:18:05
tiredbeaver: smh

14:18:06
<transcript>: Just to not think of him as the from the beginning of the game until it ends.

14:18:09
<transcript>: It's competitive.

14:18:16
<transcript>: Okay. So we're playing this week. Who are we gonna play with? Who we gonna make play with us.

14:18:21
tiredbeaver: tawny for sure

14:18:22
<transcript>: We need a group, a tightknit group that we can control so I can play as much as I want.

14:18:31
<transcript>: I can't it can't be like, getting people this, like, we have to coordinate and like, oh, not Thursday, but maybe Friday. I just need people that's, like, we're getting on in ten minutes. Let's go.

14:18:36
<transcript>: Oh, does Alan play.

14:18:42
<transcript>: I would love to play with Alan. I just need more reasons to interact with that one.

14:18:44
<transcript>: I haven't seen that on my streams.

14:18:48
<transcript>: Like I honestly I don't even know his Twitch username.

14:18:51
<transcript>: It's not counts. Cafes? Is it okay.

14:18:53
matty_twoshoes: Dax to your comment about Theo's video - he kind of credits the creation of the category to 2 major streamers, but tbh I feel it's more like the THOUSANDS of streamers in the category that cultivated the category

14:18:56
<transcript>: Rice. Okay White rice.

14:18:56
<transcript>: that makes

14:18:59
<transcript>: That makes sense. Yeah. Okay.

14:18:59
<transcript>: so i probably

14:19:11
<transcript>: So I probably did interact with them and didn't realize it. But I remember when Alan told me that he watched my streams. It's like, I don't know, an Allen. I can't think of an Allen ever in my Twitch Twitch chat TAWNI for sure. Tani was great.

14:19:11
<transcript>: i don't

14:19:16
cowfacedude99: honestly, I live on the other side of the world LUL

14:19:21
<transcript>: I don't know, tanya, that well. So I don't know if I can boss or around and be like, hey, we're playing among us right now. She'd probably do it. She was also new, and she was looking for more opportunities to play.

14:19:27
<transcript>: So you got to get when they're young and hungry. Dax to your comment about theo's video. He kind of cracked.

14:19:27
<transcript>: the creat

14:19:34
<transcript>: The creation of the category to two major streamers. But to be honest, I feel like it's more like the thousands of streams in the category that cultivated the category.

14:19:40
tiredbeaver: i enjoy watching tawny attempting to lie OMEGALUL

14:19:41
<transcript>: So I noticed in that video he didn't mention like, Leon. Leon is really huge in the early dev twitch story, right.

14:19:43
<transcript>: Learn with Leon.

14:19:46
matty_twoshoes: Leon is massive.

14:19:53
tiredbeaver: nah learn with leon was pretty late

14:19:54
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't know much, but I just I remember thinking like it's probably really hard to tell the whole history of a category on twitch because.

14:19:54
<transcript>: there's so many

14:19:57
<transcript>: There's so many people. Yeah, Leon is huge.

14:20:03
<transcript>: Like I want to say, Leon is probably doing a thousand before prime ever came along.

14:20:06
<transcript>: Oh, it was pretty late. Tired. Beaver.

14:20:06
<transcript>: okay

14:20:07
tiredbeaver: cap

14:20:11
<transcript>: Okay. I might not know anything I'm talking about, but I know he's got a huge heat.

14:20:12
tiredbeaver: prime was waay b4

14:20:19
matty_twoshoes: Leon crossed 7-8k regularly which is so bonkers.

14:20:32
<transcript>: I enjoy prime was way before. Okay. Yeah. I don't know anything. Clearly. I enjoy watching Tony attempting to lie. Yeah. Tony was just reading twitch chat. That was the thing that bothered me. She's like, reading Twist at was like, accused Adam. Like, of course they know they're watching someone else stream. They know.

14:20:36
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:20:37
tiredbeaver: nah i was in there

14:20:42
<transcript>: You just have to not watch, but you can't read chat either because if chat's watching.

14:20:42
<transcript>: i think you

14:20:43
tiredbeaver: personally I wasn't watching other streams

14:20:48
<transcript>: I think you guys my chat would be good. You guys wouldn't cheat right? If I stream you won't tell me the answers.

14:20:51
<transcript>: I think that's right.

14:20:51
tiredbeaver: can't really speak on other chatters

14:20:57
matty_twoshoes: no Kappa

14:20:59
<transcript>: You could. Yeah, that that would be no fun, though, right? Would it be fun to play if you just knew the answer? I feel like not.

14:21:03
<transcript>: For a little bit. Yeah.

14:21:08
<transcript>: You know I'm lying. Like, no, it's Adam. I can tell. He has a tell.

14:21:12
<transcript>: His tales. He's streaming on twitch. And I can see there is the imposter.

14:21:19
cowfacedude99: it would be nice for the imposter LUL

14:21:21
<transcript>: You were in there? Tired. Beaver. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Person. I wasn't watching. Other streams can't really speak on other chatters.

14:21:21
<transcript>: you were

14:21:24
<transcript>: You were in what tired. Beach, Beaver.

14:21:28
<transcript>: You were watching the the streams we did for among us.

14:21:29
tiredbeaver: tawny

14:21:30
laytanl_: Trying to figure out your tell when he's just watching your stream lol

14:21:32
<transcript>: It would be nice for the imposter. Yeah.

14:21:33
tiredbeaver: i was watching tawny

14:21:35
<transcript>: Oh, you were in tani chat.

14:21:40
<transcript>: Trying to figure out your toe when you just watching your stream. Yeah.

14:21:40
<transcript>: you're watching

14:21:46
<transcript>: You're watching tawni? So where people in Chat telling tawni that I was the imposter? Or could they just see through me.

14:21:46
<transcript>: sorry this is

14:21:47
<transcript>: Sorry, this is devolved.

14:21:47
<transcript>: if you

14:21:49
<transcript>: If you need to go.

14:21:49
<transcript>: i

14:21:57
tiredbeaver: to me, it seems like they were guessing but I'm not sure

14:21:58
<transcript>: I was actually pretty good at it. Well, it's not hard when you're brand new to it, and you're excuse can always just be. I literally have no idea what I'm doing.

14:21:58
<transcript>: like they

14:22:01
laytanl_: I don't think chat should be open at all during a game

14:22:03
tiredbeaver: i was also guessing as well

14:22:09
<transcript>: Like they would be like, when you're the imposter so obvious. You're just standing around. I'm always standing around cuz. I don't know where to go. I didn't learn there was like, way points on the map until way into, like, the third game or something.

14:22:09
<transcript>: it's like

14:22:11
tiredbeaver: i was purely just trying to get theo ejected LUL

14:22:15
<transcript>: It's like I have tasked. But where am I supposed to find all these tasks? Oh, there's just arrows. Cool.

14:22:20
<transcript>: I don't think Chad should be open at all during the game. I think that's a good role.

14:22:32
<transcript>: Okay, so, dax, I'm gonna leave it to you. You can find five other four other people.

14:22:32
matty_twoshoes: all streamers set to emote-only during the games?

14:22:38
<transcript>: Well, me, you and me, you and Allen. And then if we can find three more, I feel like we could roll with six.

14:22:38
<transcript>: get some practice

14:22:38
matty_twoshoes: could be funny

14:22:40
<transcript>: Get some practice then.

14:22:40
<transcript>: yeah

14:22:41
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:22:41
<transcript>: we're doing

14:22:42
<transcript>: We're doing it.

14:22:45
tiredbeaver: every meeting, i was just telling tawny to vote theo no matter wut

14:22:47
<transcript>: Oh, Frank and Jay, that'd be fun.

14:22:47
<transcript>: every meeting

14:22:51
<transcript>: Every meeting. I was just telling connie to vote. That theo, no matter what.

14:22:56
<transcript>: It's funny. Theater was very good. He was very good at among us. Okay.

14:23:00
<transcript>: What are we doing? Should I do more work? Dax, I don't know. What do you think.

14:23:03
daglee: I love that adam ejected bashbunni for all the wrong reasons but she was an impostor.

14:23:11
<transcript>: You just got out of bed.

14:23:18
<transcript>: So you didn't walk your dog. That was.

14:23:22
<transcript>: You were. That was aspirational. Oh, you did okay.

14:23:29
dnbull: :D

14:23:30
sockthedev: yay, the bromance

14:23:41
<transcript>: That's awesome. You have like a doberman right. Remember seeing when you got the door in.

14:23:41
<transcript>: right there

14:23:42
<transcript>: Right there.

14:23:50
<transcript>: Oh, two things. £80 cheese. That's scary. We had a boxer for a while. It was huge. And he was like.

14:23:50
<transcript>: a puppy inside

14:23:54
<transcript>: A puppy inside. Just like the sweetest dog in the world.

14:23:54
<transcript>: on your head

14:23:56
<transcript>: On your head? Yeah.

14:23:58
<transcript>: Two things. One.

14:24:03
<transcript>: Dagly. I love that. Adam ejection. Bashman. I got to tell you the story. Dax.

14:24:06
<transcript>: Bash was standing on event.

14:24:06
<transcript>: in

14:24:22
<transcript>: In the top right corner of the map, and I was walking away into the cafeteria and it she faded out over top of the vent. And I didn't know there's an animation for, like, hopping in the vent. I thought she went in the vent, and I knew you can't go into vent unless you're an impostor. I hadn't been in a pasta yet, but I knew that.

14:24:27
<transcript>: And I'm so I call a meeting. I'm like in the captory anyway, so hit the button.

14:24:27
<transcript>: i'm just

14:24:41
<transcript>: I'm just all bashed go an event, I'm pretty sure. And then it turns out it's a handful of this voter off, but then it comes out that like, oh, actually, there's an animation. Oh, and that was the fog of war. Oh, so it wasn't the right reason, but she was the imposter.

14:24:41
<transcript>: it

14:24:50
<transcript>: It worked out, but it was like we kicked her off immediately at the very beginning of this round, because I saw her fade out of you, and I thought she was in a bit.

14:24:50
<transcript>: yeah

14:24:56
<transcript>: Yeah. Beginner's luck. Exactly. The second thing I want to say is, dax, I'm seeing you on this camera right now.

14:24:56
<transcript>: and

14:25:09
tiredbeaver: there was vapejuicejordan, mew, noopkat, anthonywritescode, primeagen, bashbunni, melkey then leon popped up during the middle of the pandemic I believe

14:25:09
<transcript>: And you're oriented a certain way. There's a lamp to your right. But I watched a YouTube video, and it was all flipped. And now I don't know what's real everything's a lie, which is the real you and the real flippedness.

14:25:14
<transcript>: Okay.

14:25:17
tiredbeaver: sry for long msg LUL

14:25:18
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:25:27
<transcript>: Oh, so that was the real you.

14:25:31
<transcript>: So this is flipped.

14:25:41
<transcript>: If I was standing in the room with you looking at you just like Amber. Now the lamp would actually be to your left. Is that what you're saying.

14:25:47
<transcript>: That's crazy.

14:25:47
<transcript>: just all the time

14:25:50
<transcript>: Just all the time I spent talking with you this view.

14:25:50
<transcript>: no

14:25:58
<transcript>: No. Yeah, this is the real Me zalmi. I've gotten more used to this version of me than the mirror version. I look in the mirror and like.

14:26:03
dnbull: his background is fake Kappa

14:26:08
matty_twoshoes: @tiredbeaver not sure what criteria you're using, but there are a TON of other tech streamers not in that list...but anyway, way too many not to list

14:26:13
<transcript>: Are you gonna flip it? You're gonna give us the real Max for a SEC.

14:26:19
<transcript>: Oh, it's the real DX.

14:26:20
tiredbeaver: @Matty_TwoShoes ye im aware that i'm leaving some out

14:26:25
<transcript>: No, I really can't tell the difference. I think you're pretty symmetrical.

14:26:26
tiredbeaver: but those were the popular ones that I watched

14:26:28
beeut: true mirror

14:26:30
<transcript>: Yeah. You're looking at yourself? Yeah.

14:26:39
aj_stuyvenberg: upside down > mirror

14:26:44
<transcript>: Tired. Beaver says there was Vaitu shorten Muep Cat, antineyrite's Code Primogen bash bunny milky. Then Leon popped up during the middle of the pandemic. I believe. Wow. I had a terrible timeline.

14:26:44
<transcript>: i should remember seeing

14:26:46
matty_twoshoes: @Matty_TwoShoes all good :) a lot of women who stream not in that list ;)

14:26:54
<transcript>: I should remember seeing someone in leon's Chat saying something about being the og or something. I bet everybody who, like, follows a big streamer thinks that they were the og, just how it works.

14:26:54
daglee: Doesn't the eyes register images upside down and then the brain flips it? What is real even?

14:26:59
<transcript>: Oh Yeah.

14:27:02
laytanl_: What about beginbot

14:27:05
<transcript>: Not sure we're criteria using but there are a ton of other texturing results on that list anyway way too many not to list.

14:27:06
laytanl_: he was pretty early

14:27:10
<transcript>: Some of Chat true mirror upside down greater than mere.

14:27:10
<transcript>: let's go outside

14:27:12
laytanl_: my first subscription

14:27:14
<transcript>: Let's go outside. Downtime. What do you look like outside? No.

14:27:22
<transcript>: It doesn't the eyes register images upside down, and then the brain flips it. Yes. I think that's true.

14:27:22
<transcript>: but i guess

14:27:24
<transcript>: But I guess what's it matter if.

14:27:24
<transcript>: your brain flips

14:27:26
<transcript>: Your brain. Flips it.

14:27:26
<transcript>: what is up

14:27:29
<transcript>: What is upside down? If I don't know, I'm gonna stop.

14:27:29
<transcript>: begin

14:27:31
<transcript>: Begin bot.

14:27:42
<transcript>: Oh, yeah? Got really deep. And then it wasn't really deep. Begin bought. So do you know anything about Beginbot DA dax? You don't know twitch history.

14:27:44
matty_twoshoes: so when we go to australia we see things upside down?

14:27:51
<transcript>: Okay. So pj speaks really highly. A big Inbot like that was somebody that tease Greek, grew up, grew up on on twitch. If you, if you will.

14:27:53
tiredbeaver: @Matty_TwoShoes i was gonna put Lana_lux but i forgot her twitch name

14:27:59
<transcript>: And I don't I don't know anything about begin button. His avatar is just like a monkey, so I don't I don't I've never seen his streams. I don't know.

14:27:59
<transcript>: he follow

14:28:01
tiredbeaver: plus I haven't watched her inawhile

14:28:03
<transcript>: He followed me on Twitter, though yesterday. That's why I'm bringing that. Because.

14:28:03
<transcript>: i don't know

14:28:06
<transcript>: I don't know I don't know how he knows me.

14:28:06
<transcript>: he's

14:28:09
laytanl_: He used to stream similar to prime I guess

14:28:14
<transcript>: He's a peer. He follows me. So peer. I'm like some of those peers that don't. Okay, sorry.

14:28:18
tiredbeaver: there was also mastermndio

14:28:20
<transcript>: Use the stream similar to prime like crazy like a crazy man with his hair on fire.

14:28:20
<transcript>: i love

14:28:22
laytanl_: Now he just does web3 so I don't really follow it

14:28:22
tiredbeaver: but i don't see that man anymore

14:28:29
<transcript>: I love prime so much. I so I was talking. So I was in bash's chat yesterday. So you need to go. You like said, you need to go work. And I just keep talking about dumb stuff.

14:28:33
<transcript>: Okay. You're completely.

14:28:33
<transcript>: i was

14:28:36
<transcript>: I was in bash's chat and.

14:28:36
<transcript>: we talked

14:28:41
<transcript>: We talked a little bit. She was bringing up kind of like feeling overwhelmed. And you compare yourself to other people online.

14:28:53
<transcript>: And this made me think, like when I first saw prime on twitch, which was right after I started streaming, I did not know I hadn't watched no developers on twitch when I started my first dream.

14:28:53
<transcript>: i just

14:29:01
<transcript>: I just wasn't aware of Twitch. Hardly. And I remember the first Prime Twitch stream I watched, and it was like.

14:29:01
<transcript>: no

14:29:03
<transcript>: No bit of.

14:29:06
daglee: Beginbot is the ultimate "I work on this for 80 hours", then get it 50% done and never touch it again.

14:29:09
<transcript>: Envy or compares. It was just like, this guy is insane. And he's amazing. And I love it.

14:29:15
<transcript>: There's no feeling like a peer? There's no feeling like, oh, man, my streams are awful. It's just like this guy's doing something.

14:29:15
<transcript>: completely different that

14:29:19
<transcript>: Completely different that I will never be able to do. And I'm in awe of it.

14:29:19
<transcript>: okay

14:29:22
<transcript>: Okay, that's enough. I'll stop.

14:29:22
sockthedev: he really is on another plane

14:29:24
<transcript>: We go to Australia.

14:29:30
<transcript>: Oh, no, no, that's it. That's the Point prime's. Awesome. Yes.

14:29:38
<transcript>: Oh, yeah yeah for sure.

14:29:49
tiredbeaver: it has to be the 'stache

14:29:51
<transcript>: Yeah. I watched. So once I heard that the 15th time, like on Twitter or wherever I went and watched and Dr. Disrespect and there's clearly some parallels.

14:29:59
matty_twoshoes: i actually believe that prime modeled his online persona after that

14:30:11
<transcript>: Mastermindio. Mr. Mindio? Okay, we should stop talking about the history of twitch. Why'd you bring up that video? Dax, it's your fault. You brought up theo's video. You brought up the other video. And then we just started talking about the history of twitch. You know, I'm saying.

14:30:31
laytanl_: @daglee isn't every streamer LOL

14:30:31
<transcript>: Begin bot is the ultrasound last thing the ultimate. I work on this for 80 hours, didn't get it 50% done and never touched again. I felt that when I read that I felt it in my core, my essence, because the number of things I worked on a whole lot got it kind of done and then just never touched it again.

14:30:31
<transcript>: it's

14:30:36
<transcript>: It's alarming. I'm sorry. Dax? Rebates. We're gonna finish. Because you're gonna help me.

14:30:36
<transcript>: if i

14:30:41
<transcript>: If I had someone with me. Yes, I would have finished all this.

14:30:45
<transcript>: No.

14:30:52
<transcript>: If we do five shows in Nobody Shows up and everyone thinks it's dumb, then we can talk, but we're gonna We're gonna do some.

14:31:01
tiredbeaver: tawny is like "start on rust project, and never actually code" type streamer

14:31:02
<transcript>: Yeah. I told him because.

14:31:02
<transcript>: i just felt

14:31:06
<transcript>: I just felt bad when like I don't think the domain is working.

14:31:10
tiredbeaver: but her streams are always engaging

14:31:26
<transcript>: I know it always got really good feedback. I literally had no reason to stop working on it like 700 signups active people using the beta and give me feedback and like, this is great. I never did have a website and I'm not a frontend developer so I can't make my own. But I do a lot of Dev stuff. It was like.

14:31:44
<transcript>: All the right feedback to validate the idea and to keep moving forward. Had a handful of people buy it like pay for it in the private beta. And I just. I just stopped working on it actually was twitch. I started streaming, then I started playing with twitch overlays Killer of all side projects.

14:31:44
<transcript>: and i started doing

14:31:47
<transcript>: And I started doing me of him by then it was too late.

14:31:49
<transcript>: The thing was dead.

14:31:52
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:31:58
<transcript>: For sure.

<transcript>: Chris Novakris? No. White panther? Yes. Acorn geez, freckle bite. So you're naming some of my favorites? Actually, in fact, I think before I discovered most of the streamers I watched today, like, I don't think I had discovered tie's before I was hanging out in Chris Nova and White Panthers. Chris Nova actually.

14:34:12
<transcript>: she

14:34:19
<transcript>: She lived in springfield, right next to where I live. I found that out hanging out in her chat.

14:34:22

14:34:31
daglee: You know Tawny but do you know Gary?

14:34:32
nikolaxhristov: 🎸

14:34:34
<transcript>: An acorn. I think I rated acorn, like every day for two weeks straight, because I didn't know anybody else on twitch. It was Nick. What's his name? Nick. Nick.

14:34:36
laytanl_: I go to prime for adhd, teej for neovim and cool stuff, you for the chill vibes

14:34:51
<transcript>: Nick. Juan. No, it was his name is Nick, but his star ansible his username is totally different, just like everyone else here on twitch. You guys all have crazy usernames.

14:34:57
nikolaxhristov: peer vibes

14:34:58
matty_twoshoes: OH omg staransible hasn't been on in a while

14:35:00
<transcript>: Star interval rated me like the second time I streamed, and I didn't know I didn't even know what a raid was, and it terrified me because.

14:35:02
<transcript>: It sounds so aggressive.

14:35:02
<transcript>: yeah

14:35:04
tiredbeaver: @Matty_TwoShoes i've tuned into all of those streams but I watch roxcodes more often

14:35:09
<transcript>: Yeah, I think he's not streaming anymore. I think Nick like his startup maybe isn't going anymore. I'm not sure.

14:35:14
marcusbuer: the good usernames are usually already taken

14:35:14
tiredbeaver: also AlgoBro

14:35:15
<transcript>: But he rated me. And then I remember, like the only people who were on that I ever.

14:35:15
<transcript>: knew

14:35:17
<transcript>: Knew.

14:35:17
<transcript>: at my weird

14:35:18
<transcript>: At my weird hours.

14:35:18
<transcript>: for acorn and

14:35:22
matty_twoshoes: timezones are a big challenge LUL

14:35:24
<transcript>: For Acorn and star ansible and staring's bowl would be leaving so he would raid me. And then I would raid a corn.

14:35:27
<transcript>: I like acorn, too.

14:35:27
<transcript>: the good

14:35:41
tiredbeaver: homie was the best 3am stream I tuned into

14:35:41
<transcript>: And.

14:35:41
<transcript>: that's where

<transcript>: I'll go, bro? I've never heard of Al? Go, bro.

14:35:48
<transcript>: that's the thing i

14:35:49
dnbull: just add a console log somewhere to feel productive

14:35:54
<transcript>: That's the thing. I feel like there's still like dozens of Dev streamers that I just haven't even run into yet.

14:35:54
<transcript>: like even

14:36:11
<transcript>: Like even people. I feel pretty like very aware of friends of friends, of friends. Like bash. I feel like I never see bad movie. She's not strange as much anymore, but I felt like there's a long period where I only knew bash through friends, but I hadn't even seen any of her streams. Twitch is a big place. It's a big place.

14:36:17
<transcript>: Time zones. Yeah. I was streaming at such weird hours when I started that none of the.

14:36:46
f0ll0w: @tiredbeaver what happened to him? he just disappeared :-(

14:36:47
<transcript>: Those were good times. I was starting at like 03:00 a.m. My time.

14:36:55
tiredbeaver: @F0LL0W his startup didn't work out

14:36:58
<transcript>: The end Bull. You find most Dev streams boring. You watch the person because they're cool and you're in my Twitch chat, which makes I think you think I'm cool.

14:37:03
<transcript>: Which I find a little Susse. And the word Susse.

14:37:03
<transcript>: used

14:37:04
dnbull: youre great

14:37:11
<transcript>: Used a lot in among us people say Susse a lot. I think it's just it's shorter than suspect or suspicious.

14:37:11
tiredbeaver: @mjewl tsoding is really cool but his streams are usually quite technical

14:37:11
nikolaxhristov: sussy baka

14:37:13
ghostyx101: Star ansibles company was bankrupt

laytanl_: Yeah +1 on tsoding

14:37:19
matty_twoshoes: @tiredbeaver oh that's sad to hear about nick...

14:37:23
<transcript>: So it's just you're trying to fly around with the words and you're like, I'm Susse on X, Y and Z. And that what you just said. That was a little fuss. There's a lot of flying around.

14:37:23
f0ll0w: @tiredbeaver damn, that sucks.

14:37:25
ghostyx101: He ain't streaming

14:37:26

14:38:56
dnbull: i dont make money, i rely on the government Kappa

14:38:58

14:39:31
<transcript>: Barry at our startup last year. No vc round. Just Angels.

14:39:41
<transcript>: Falloff in lp excitement.

14:39:41
<transcript>: i don't think vengeance

14:39:47
<transcript>: I don't think vengeance are raising at the rate they were, there was always gonna be a delay between, like.

14:39:47
<transcript>: peak market

14:39:51
<transcript>: Peak market hysteria and market trough.

14:39:51
<transcript>: like

14:40:01
<transcript>: Like all these funds that are already raised during the Peak have all their capital to deploy so like they're gonna keep deploying it then eventually the lps get tired of everything dies.

14:40:01
<transcript>: and they

14:40:07
<transcript>: And they stop being able to raise rounds. The venture capitalists stop being able to raise their funds.

14:40:07
<transcript>: and then it gets

14:40:12
<transcript>: And then it gets hard and I don't know if we've gotten there yet someone who's tried to raise to tell me.

14:40:18
<transcript>: Deal with it. Glasses.

14:40:18
<transcript>: it's funny

14:40:19
lucca_rodrigues: heyo, i remember watching one of your videos on YT a while ago, didn't know you were on twitch too! this stream seems fun :-)

14:40:29
<transcript>: The ts. Oh, it's coding.

14:40:29
<transcript>: pronoun

<transcript>: I will refund you cafes in the form of an iou.

14:41:14
<transcript>: at least

14:41:21
tiredbeaver: i remember that period where anything with "crypto" and "web3", VCs just threw money at them

14:41:22
<transcript>: At least at least that maybe more. Luca, welcome to Chat. Hey. Oh, I remember watching one of your videos on YouTube awhile ago. Didn't know you were on Twitter.

14:41:22
<transcript>: this dream

14:41:25
<transcript>: This dream seems fun. So I'm more on twitch than I'm on YouTube.

14:41:25
<transcript>: at least i was

14:41:31
<transcript>: At least I was. I used to stream a lot for an intense three months, four month, maybe.

14:41:31
<transcript>: and

14:41:34

14:41:34
<transcript>: and

14:41:42
<transcript>: And eventually I'll do YouTube. I just. I can't take a break from YouTube. I filmed a lot of stuff. Youtube is stressful.

<transcript>: you have all these

14:41:44
<transcript>: You have all these ideas.

14:41:44
<transcript>: you film

14:41:50
<transcript>: You film stuff, and then it's just hard to like, I can't sell myself on my own videos.

14:41:50
<transcript>: after i

14:41:56
<transcript>: After I film, and I'm like, I don't want to watch that. Why would anyone else? So I don't edit it. And then it just dies on my hard drive.

14:42:02
laytanl_: How is that idea you dm'ed me about going?

14:42:05
<transcript>: I remember that period where anything with crypto and Web three vcs just through money at them. Yeah.

14:42:08
thdxr: it's so much work before you find out if a video is worth doing

14:42:14
<transcript>: I have opinions on bcs that I'm not going to say out loud. Do you know my friends, Brian? Oh, sorry. I should have read that loud. That's a private message.

14:42:20
<transcript>: Sj. How would I know them? Are they local.

14:42:38
<transcript>: say

14:42:44
nikolaxhristov: damn

<transcript>: i have a

14:42:48
nikolaxhristov: :D

14:42:50
<transcript>: I have a hard time with that. I do live in the Ozarks. Nico, do you live in the Ozarks.

14:42:59
nikolaxhristov: but I've watched Ozark

14:43:04
<transcript>: Oh, you don't live in the ozark, but you've watched. Okay.

14:43:06
<transcript>: That's funny.

14:43:06
<transcript>: i just

14:43:09
nikolaxhristov: I know what you people do

14:43:10
thdxr: I did that for the prisma video, was sold on the concept + thumbnail but that was an easy concept

14:43:10
nikolaxhristov: :D

14:43:12
marcusbuer: LUL

14:43:18
dnbull: id just say make the videos. the more videos you make youll then realize what works and what doesnt work

14:43:26
<transcript>: I just I love that show because now people know something about the ozark, like, before that show. Before Jason bateman and Netflix put ozark on the map, of the Ozarks on the map, I would say, I'm from springfield, Missouri, and people are like, oh, Where's that? You don't be, don't need to know it's. It's not worth knowing. And now I get to say, I'm from the Ozarks.

14:43:26
<transcript>: and people

14:43:37
dnbull: yup, I thought the ozarks was fake because of the show

14:43:38
<transcript>: And people are like, like, the show. I love that show. Everyone loves that show. It must be a really great show because everybody loves it. I never hear somebody say, oh, that show. And never, I hate that show. O's, Ark.

14:43:40
<transcript>: I love that show I know where you live.

14:43:40
<transcript>: you live

14:43:42
<transcript>: You live in the place where.

14:43:42
<transcript>: all

14:43:43
dnbull: the show is dope

14:43:46
<transcript>: All the river people live and it's true. I do.

14:43:46
<transcript>: and

14:43:52
<transcript>: And where all the drug dealers are done, their drug deals are done. And that's also true. All the drug deals.

14:43:54
nikolaxhristov: :D

14:43:57
dnbull: no wonder adam got money... he's doing drugs Kappa

14:44:03
laytanl_: Haven't watched it

14:44:06
<transcript>: Thought the ozarks was fake because of the show. Nope, it's real. Just say, make the videos. The more videos you make. You then realize what works and what doesn't work. That's a good point. I should just. I should just ship stuff. Just ship the videos out.

14:44:15
<transcript>: So it's funny. I think what I've gathered about the ozark Show. I've watched, like the first two episodes. I've gathered that.

14:44:15
<transcript>: the

14:44:16
laytanl_: Actually I think I watched one episode

14:44:35
<transcript>: The drug usage or the drug seen in the show. The ozark is like cartels and really like exciting stuff. But in reality, in the ozarks, drug usage is math and people in the Woods cooking it and their labs blowing up. That's exciting. But like it's a lot less exciting than the TV.

14:44:35
<transcript>: show

14:44:37
<transcript>: Show.

14:44:37
<transcript>: brag

<transcript>: that's like

14:47:41
schrew: I love a low cost of living. God bless South Carolina

14:47:53
<transcript>: That's like, I think it was a one bedroom apartment. It was like $5,000 a month. And I don't know where the market has gone since then, but it was insane. It's like, do you know what you can afford in the ozarks for $5,000 a month.

14:47:57
<transcript>: A mansion. A literal mansion.

14:47:57

<transcript>: and we have

14:48:18
nikolaxhristov: PogChamp

14:48:23
<transcript>: And we have a podcast together. I mean, that's not how we know each other. That'd be weird if you met somebody by starting a podcast with them. But we do have a podcast together tomorrow.

14:48:39
<transcript>: In the forward slash. Oh, no, it did know it was link Oops.

14:48:44
<transcript>: Let's see. Is it lower than Texas, though I don't know. Tired.

14:48:44
<transcript>: maybe

14:48:46
<transcript>: Maybe.

14:48:46
<transcript>: i'm sure

14:48:49
<transcript>: I'm sure I'm sure there are places in Texas that are affordable.

14:48:53
<transcript>: But where I live, like in Southwest Missouri.

14:48:53
<transcript>: it's pretty

14:48:56
<transcript>: It's pretty pretty low on the cost of living scale.

14:49:08
<transcript>: Go fishing once. Problem solved. Exactly. Andre. That's like. Or Andre, that's like how I can sell. I used arch, by the way, because I installed it a couple weeks ago. So now.

14:49:08
<transcript>: i

14:49:10
<transcript>: I used arch.

14:49:10
thdxr: @dnbull nice!

14:49:13
tiredbeaver: ARCH BTW

14:49:14
<transcript>: That's just as good, right as using it actively.

14:49:14
<transcript>: i fish

14:49:16
<transcript>: I fished.

14:49:16
<transcript>: good

14:49:19
<transcript>: Good time. Here's. My hat.

14:49:23
<transcript>: South Carolina Also low cost of living. I'm sure.

14:49:25
tiredbeaver: tbh, having things break every now and then is the linux experience

14:49:26
<transcript>: Dad.

14:49:26
<transcript>: you

14:49:28
<transcript>: You planned it in a Congress this year.

14:49:32
<transcript>: Is that not your jam? So I went to reinvent last year.

14:49:36
<transcript>: And that's a week long.

14:49:36
<transcript>: so

14:49:38
<transcript>: So maybe not again this year, but.

14:49:38
<transcript>: probably

14:49:41
<transcript>: Probably a Tech conference. That's shorter.

14:49:41
<transcript>: next

14:49:46
<transcript>: Next one's gonna come to react Miami. Anybody react Miami. Anybody.

14:49:49

dnbull: i went to react miami last year and it was on a monday yuckkkk

14:50:02
<transcript>: Do you mind telling me like quadrants of Arkansas.

14:50:02
<transcript>: wait

14:50:07
<transcript>: Waiter, is this a person who lives in northwestern Arkansas, that we were just talking.

14:50:12
<transcript>: Some one earlier in the stream was saying the Northwest Arkansas was at usj.

14:50:13
dnbull: but this year is on a thurs i think

14:50:18
<transcript>: Arch by the way, to be honest, having things break every now and then, it's a linux experience.

14:50:19
sj_se: Northeast is where Im at

14:50:22
sockthedev: wtf, you both have renounced react

14:50:23
<transcript>: I see the appeal as much as it seems dumb to like things breaking.

14:50:23
<transcript>: it's kind of

14:50:24
sj_se: Northeast Arkansas

14:50:25
lucca_rodrigues: are those lego creator modular buildings in the background? the lighting looks awesome!

14:50:30
<transcript>: It's kind of fun when you kind of get to tinker and you know what's going on underneath the hood a little bit.

14:50:32
<transcript>: Northeast is where you're at.

14:50:34
<transcript>: Yes. Okay.

14:50:37
thdxr: @sockthedev I'm literally giving a talk at react miami lmao

littletruckerman: when is the adamdoesarch stream?

14:50:40
sockthedev: i'll notify them to ban y'all

14:50:42
<transcript>: We've both renounced react.

14:50:43
thdxr: shhh

14:50:44
sockthedev: omg dx

14:50:46
sockthedev: lol

14:50:52
<transcript>: I have renowned react. Are those lego Creator module buildings in background? Yes. The landing looks awesome. Thank you, luca. That is what they are.

14:50:52
<transcript>: in fact

14:50:53
<transcript>: In fact.

14:50:53
<transcript>: in fact

14:50:54

14:50:54
<transcript>: In fact.

14:50:54
<transcript>: i will move

14:50:59
<transcript>: I will move out of the way so you can see them in focus. Hang on.

14:51:07
<transcript>: I forgot to put a camera back there.

14:51:12
dnbull: he's lying to you the background is a green screen Kappa

14:51:16
<transcript>: I put a camera back there today for a little alternate view. When I go on break.

14:51:20
<transcript>: When is the atom.

14:51:20
<transcript>: does

14:51:25
<transcript>: Does arch Stream good crush. Good question, little trekkerman.

14:51:25
<transcript>: i don't

14:51:29
schrew: I remember where that was true @dnbull

14:51:30
<transcript>: I don't know how I would stream from it. I feel like I'm missing something. I guess I could try installing.

14:51:31
thdxr: how do you wire the camera when it's far away, is it just messy?

14:51:34
<transcript>: Obs on it or I can just have it here with me.

14:51:34
<transcript>: i could have arch

14:51:38
<transcript>: I could have arch up, and I could be like, Show. I don't know. Is that done.

14:51:45
<transcript>: Yeah. Dax is giving a talk at React Miami. Dax also doesn't use react.

14:51:49
<transcript>: That's so funny.

14:51:49
dnbull: @Schrew I was blown away when he had nothing but green screen last time LUL

14:51:58
<transcript>: Line you line to you. The background is a green screen. It is not the envelope it used to be. It is not anymore. It's all real. Watch the.

14:51:58
sockthedev: @thdxr 😂

14:51:58
nikolaxhristov: @littletruckerman LUL

14:52:06
lucca_rodrigues: so cool!!! i've been a huge fan of lego since i was 5 haha

14:52:11
<transcript>: It's all real. You can touch it with your hands.

14:52:11
<transcript>: but you can't

14:52:14
<transcript>: But you can't because you're not here. But I can.

14:52:20
<transcript>: Brag? A mat. Did I see that you followed me? Thank you for following me. I don't know if I saw that or not.

14:52:24
<transcript>: How do you wire the camera when it's far away? Is it just messy.

14:52:30
sj_se: do you do any investing in startups?

14:52:30
<transcript>: So both things can be true. It is messy in here but also.

14:52:32
<transcript>: I have.

14:52:35
lucca_rodrigues: looks AI upscaled to me /jk

14:52:37
<transcript>: Wireless hdmi transceiver.

14:52:37
<transcript>: you

14:52:38
<transcript>: You see that.

14:52:38
<transcript>: so i

14:52:41
dnbull: Adam, I always mess with you about the green screen - I was shocked when that one time you had your whole room in a green screen

14:52:41
<transcript>: So I can wirelessly transmit HTML.

14:52:43
aj_stuyvenberg: that looks expensive.

14:52:51
<transcript>: Anywhere to my office from in my house. And at some point I'm just going to pick up a camera on a gimbal and walk around my house. I'll give a house tour. That'll be fun.

14:52:51
<transcript>: because

14:52:54
<transcript>: Because I can just stream it straight to my machine.

14:53:02
thdxr: is your main camera wireless also?

14:53:07
<transcript>: Yeah. I did that little, like green screen stint where I had a green screen behind me so I could, like, put stuff between me and the green screen.

14:53:07
<transcript>: it just felt so

14:53:12
<transcript>: It just felt so weird, though. I had the green tinge around my I just didn't like it.

14:53:12
<transcript>: i don't like

14:53:15
<transcript>: I don't like the chroma King, just all of it.

14:53:19
<transcript>: Do you do investing in startups? Great Question, SJ.

14:53:23
<transcript>: Today to date, my wife has not been a big fan of that idea.

14:53:23
<transcript>: so

14:53:25
<transcript>: So we.

14:53:25
<transcript>: invest

14:53:25
cowfacedude99: wait. that can act as an input, so you can show off your arch system on stream LUL

14:53:26
lucca_rodrigues: whoa didn't know wireless hdmi was a thing, that's pretty cool

14:53:26
marcusbuer: retroreflective chroma key is so much better

14:53:30
<transcript>: Invest in like just index funds, just dumb, boring things to put your money in.

14:53:33
<transcript>: She doesn't she's heard.

14:53:33
<transcript>: and i get it

14:53:43
<transcript>: And I get it the idea that like if you're in tech, you work in tech, and then you invest in tech. It's like all your eggs are in a basket. And I get it. I get the argument.

14:53:46
marcusbuer: than green screen

14:53:50
<transcript>: So we've not traditionally jumped on angel opportunities, and we've had a few that I wanted to jump on, but.

14:53:50
<transcript>: we're just not

14:53:53
<transcript>: We're just not sort of breached that chasm.

14:53:53
<transcript>: and invest

14:54:01
<transcript>: And invested in software startups. I've started some software startups. I've taken investment dollars. I have notled them out.

14:54:05
<transcript>: I always looks AI upscale to me.

14:54:13
<transcript>: I always mess with you about the green screen. I was shocked when that one time you had your whole room at a green screen. Yeah, I did catch you off guard tonight.

14:54:13
sockthedev: run to dax for the money

14:54:19
<transcript>: People didn't even know I pulled a rug.

14:54:19
<transcript>: is that

14:54:24
<transcript>: Is that the phrase? It's like, I I pulled a fast one on you.

14:54:28
<transcript>: I used to see this background. And then suddenly it was sake.

14:54:28
<transcript>: and i didn't tell anybody

14:54:29
<transcript>: And I didn't tell anybody.

14:54:29
<transcript>: is your main came

14:54:31
<transcript>: Is your main camera? Wireless? Also no.

14:54:31
<transcript>: the

14:54:33
itsbr00n: wool over the eyes ;)

14:54:35
<transcript>: The main camera is just wired straight into my Mac.

14:54:45
<transcript>: That can act as an input so you can show off your arch. Just one stream. That's right, cafes. I could wirelessly connect my.

14:54:46
daglee: Have you seen the fridge is fake video from twitch?

14:54:46
thdxr: we invested in a bunch of startups in 2020 and now we're out of money

14:54:48
<transcript>: Hdmi, but I can also just plug it in.

14:54:58
daglee: Most random thing ever.

14:55:06
<transcript>: Yeah. Luca, I'm so pumped about this wireless htm. I think it opened up so many ideas in my mind, like things that I can do now, because I can just stream a video feed to my computer, which has obs running. Yeah, I'm just. I'm gonna do something fun with it. I don't know. At some point.

14:55:16
<transcript>: Retro reflective Chromicy is so much better than green screen. What is this? What is retro reflective chroma key? I'm gonna Google that.

14:55:16
<transcript>: run

14:55:21
<transcript>: Run to dax for the money. Yeah, dax, invest in my startups like rebase.

14:55:27
<transcript>: First. I'm chat. What's on the chat? It's brune wool over the eyes. That's the one that's the saying that I missed.

14:55:27
<transcript>: have you seen the fr

14:55:32
<transcript>: Have you seen the fridge of fake video from twitch? No, I had not.

14:55:37
<transcript>: We invested in a bunch of starts in 2020, and now we're out of money. There you go.

14:55:39
<transcript>: The fridges? Fake.

14:55:54
<transcript>: I will also look that up, but retro reflective chroma key. I'm so curious. Okay, let's actually like, I'm not a just chatting stream. I am a software and game development stream. People. We should be doing software.

14:55:55
<transcript>: And Game development.

14:55:58
nikolaxhristov: PogChamp

14:55:58
<transcript>: Did I. Oh, it worked.

14:55:58
<transcript>: my overlay

14:56:00

tnkhanh: software time POGGERS

14:56:11
<transcript>: I was oh, yeah? I was gonna do this.

14:56:12
littletruckerman: and game?

14:56:16
<transcript>: Here's the data that I need to render this thing.

14:56:17
thdxr: more game development

14:56:24
<transcript>: Yeah. A little trickman. Yeah. We're gonna do some among us streaming as soon as I can get five other human beings to get on with me.

14:56:32
<transcript>: Zach, just let me know. I want to do it soon. Like, as soon as you can. As soon as you can find five people, literally.

14:56:35
<transcript>: Like you want to do it right now. Okay.

14:56:38
<transcript>: Mortgage, more game development.

14:56:38
thdxr: I just messaged me friends

14:56:43
<transcript>: Okay, this is a lot of data. I'm still scrolling.

14:56:46
tnkhanh: lol

14:56:49
<transcript>: Still scrolling. Here we go. Home. Detail. So that's what powers that.

14:56:49
<transcript>: no it isn't

14:56:50
<transcript>: No, it isn't.

14:56:55
<transcript>: Where is it.

14:57:02
cowfacedude99: `let's get some work done` and adam just talks with chat the whole time. LUL

14:57:06
<transcript>: Here it is so that's the that's the data that does that right here.

14:57:06
<transcript>: team stats

14:57:07
<transcript>: Team stats.

14:57:11
<transcript>: Where's the title.

14:57:11
<transcript>: oh yeah here we go

14:57:13
<transcript>: Oh, yeah? Here we go.

14:57:13
<transcript>: new

14:57:15
<transcript>: New York, Nick.

14:57:17
<transcript>: Wait.

14:57:22
<transcript>: That's the grid. Well, this player stats. Okay.

14:57:30
<transcript>: So Game ID.

14:57:30
<transcript>: completed game

14:57:32
<transcript>: Completed Game status. Final.

14:57:38
<transcript>: And then we have our home team with all this data right here.

14:57:38
<transcript>: no

14:57:40
<transcript>: No.

14:57:48
<transcript>: That's what powers this. Okay, well, we just need to render this thing first anyway, so here's what I'm gonna do.

14:57:51
<transcript>: I'm gonna go to the.

14:57:51
<transcript>: dom

14:57:54
<transcript>: Dom, and I'm gonna grab all of this.

14:57:57
<transcript>: I'm just gonna do this.

14:58:00
<transcript>: Let's render this thing first.

14:58:03
<transcript>: I'm just gonna copy the whole element.

14:58:04
<transcript>: Oh Yes.

14:58:12
<transcript>: Like this.

14:58:18
<transcript>: I paste it in there. See what I did there.

14:58:21
<transcript>: Is that the way I should do it? Probably not.

14:58:28
<transcript>: Oh, no, did I just close? I just close my term again? I'm so dumb.

14:58:28
<transcript>: why do i do that

14:58:31
<transcript>: Why do I do that? But look at that. Look at that. We're done.

14:58:32
<transcript>: I'm just kidding.

14:58:43
<transcript>: I mean, it does look like the pages done, but it doesn't have dynamic data. That's all fake. Right? So we got to actually make it real now, but I gotta reopen.

14:58:47
<transcript>: Got a real Penny because I keep doing that.

14:58:53
<transcript>: Let's get some work done and I'm just talks to chat the whole time. Exactly.

14:58:57
<transcript>: T. Max.

14:59:01
<transcript>: A E zero. There it is.

14:59:01
<transcript>: the thing

14:59:03
<transcript>: The thing. No harm done.

14:59:07
<transcript>: Okay.

14:59:13
<transcript>: So how do we make this real? Well, I'm glad you asked.

14:59:16
<transcript>: Here's what we do.

14:59:16
<transcript>: we figure out

14:59:20
<transcript>: We figure out why is that overlap like that? That doesn't look right.

14:59:28
<transcript>: So text is that color. That's not dynamic. That's just always that way.

14:59:28
<transcript>: this

14:59:30
<transcript>: This looks wrong.

14:59:30
marcusbuer: retroreflective uses the same fabric used in reflective strips used in safety gear. Then you use a ring light around the camera lens and the fabric reflects the green light only in the direction of the lens, so you don't get that green rim around the subject and it doesn't need so much space as green fabric because it doesn't need to be lit evenly.

14:59:34
<transcript>: Why does that look so wrong.

14:59:34
<transcript>: why is this a paul

14:59:35
<transcript>: Why is this a Paul.

14:59:44
<transcript>: Bits. We're gonna get the images.

14:59:51
<transcript>: By the way, I hate the way. Prettier formats html Literally hate it.

14:59:51
<transcript>: it's so bad

14:59:52
<transcript>: It's so bad.

15:00:04
<transcript>: Let's just try and like find all this data.

15:00:05
<transcript>: The title.

15:00:11
<transcript>: Okay. Here. First thing I can do is I can try to replace.

15:00:12
<transcript>: This.

15:00:15
<transcript>: With.

15:00:15
<transcript>: data

15:00:16
nikolaxhristov: you should format astro files with the prettier-plugin-astro

15:00:16

<transcript>: dot

15:00:19
<transcript>: Dot, visual, dot.

15:00:20
<transcript>: Detail.

15:00:36
<transcript>: And array index. Is that right.

15:00:36
<transcript>: feels bad

15:00:37
<transcript>: Feels bad.

15:00:38
sj_se: what IDE(s) do you use?

15:00:42
<transcript>: Surely not right.

15:00:45
<transcript>: Did we see.

15:00:47
<transcript>: Here's our data.

15:00:49
tiredbeaver: @sj_se neovim

15:00:52
<transcript>: Yeah, it's just the first item in the array.

15:00:55
<transcript>: Feels weird, but I think that's the way it works.

15:01:05
<transcript>: And I can work with that. Zero.

15:01:09
<transcript>: Team now.

15:01:10
<transcript>: Zero.

15:01:13
<transcript>: Entity.

15:01:14
sj_se: @sj_se thx

15:01:15
<transcript>: Does this look like.

15:01:25
<transcript>: Oh, this is my typescript. Type is bad? The type is bad.

15:01:29
<transcript>: It's the types. Fault typescript lied to me.

15:01:49
<transcript>: Straight uplide retroflective uses the same fabric used and reflective strips used in safety gear. Then use a ring light around the camera lens and the fabric reflects the green light only in the direction of the lens. So you don't get that green rim around the subject. Oh, and it doesn't need so much spaces. Green fabric because it doesn't need to be.

15:01:49
<transcript>: even

15:01:59
<transcript>: Evenly. That sounds so helpful. I hate green screens because I can't get them lit evenly and because I glow and I look green because I'm so close to it.

15:02:06
<transcript>: So that sounds like it solves all my problems. You should format astrophiles with the prettier plugin astro. Oh, I am Nico.

15:02:06
<transcript>: i am

15:02:08
<transcript>: I am.

15:02:15
<transcript>: It's still like still this weird stuff. Like even with the plugin. Pretty just as weird.

15:02:15
<transcript>: weird

15:02:17
<transcript>: Weird stuff. Like look at this.

15:02:17
<transcript>: so

15:02:18
<transcript>: So.

15:02:18
<transcript>: why

15:02:22
<transcript>: Why is this div? For instance.

15:02:22
<transcript>: why is it doing

15:02:26
<transcript>: Why is it doing this? Why is it not on the next line? That was pretty.

15:02:28
<transcript>: Or did this.

15:02:30
<transcript>: I don't understand why.

15:02:35
<transcript>: No, I'm not smart enough to understand why.

15:02:40
<transcript>: So we're just gonna say detail, zero.

15:02:45
<transcript>: Dot, I'm gonna fix this. Just give me a SEC. I'm gonna make it better.

15:02:47
<transcript>: The Way team.

15:02:49
<transcript>: Dot.

15:02:54
<transcript>: Logo URL.

15:02:56
<transcript>: Type script's gonna yell at me.

15:03:00
<transcript>: But watch it's gonna work.

15:03:04
<transcript>: Kind of work. That's what's cool.

15:03:09
<transcript>: Okay. So you can't tell that it changed, but that's not dynamic. So if I choose a different game.

15:03:09
<transcript>: let's go to

15:03:12
<transcript>: Let's go to like who won last night.

15:03:16
<transcript>: In the UBA.

15:03:16
<transcript>: okay

15:03:21
<transcript>: Okay. So let's look at this game. And I'm gonna just watch this.

15:03:21
<transcript>: watch this

15:03:22
<transcript>: Watch this.

15:03:26
<transcript>: That first logo is gonna change now because it's dynamic.

15:03:26
<transcript>: it's dynam

15:03:33
<transcript>: It's dynamic. That's the wrong name, because that's not dynamic. But this is dynamic.

15:03:36
<transcript>: What IDE.

15:03:36
<transcript>: like ide

15:03:39
<transcript>: Like ides. Do you use I mean neovim.

15:03:39
<transcript>: i'm enjoying it

15:03:41
<transcript>: I'm enjoying it quite a lot.

15:03:45
<transcript>: Okay. I need to fix this type.

15:03:47
<transcript>: I need to fix.

15:03:47
<transcript>: what

15:03:50
<transcript>: What type? It's a gamera.

15:03:50
<transcript>: camera

15:03:53
<transcript>: Camera response. I think right now.

15:04:04
<transcript>: This one. Okay. So this is not actually the shape of the thing.

15:04:04
<transcript>: i'm gonna make

15:04:05
<transcript>: I'm gonna make an actual.

15:04:14
<transcript>: Detail.

15:04:23
<transcript>: Also has a tie.

15:04:23
<transcript>: okay

15:04:27
<transcript>: Okay. Oh, there's some fancy stuff we could do with typescript here.

15:04:31
<transcript>: So if I look at the detail.

15:04:43
<transcript>: On it.

15:04:57
<transcript>: I need to delete this.

15:05:04
<transcript>: Am I missing the type? Is it that download.

15:05:04
<transcript>: might just be down lower

15:05:07
<transcript>: Might just be down lower summary.

15:05:13
<transcript>: No, there's no tight, wait.

15:05:13
<transcript>: still one

15:05:15
<transcript>: Still one. Just still one of them.

15:05:26
<transcript>: I don't see a type.

15:05:37
<transcript>: Home team away team Summary So I bet if I look here, there's probably answer visual detail.

15:05:43
<transcript>: Mba Historical Box score.

15:05:47
<transcript>: Yeah. Home team waiting. So that's the shape of this thing.

15:05:51
<transcript>: But Where's the type that it says there would be a type.

15:05:55
<transcript>: I see no type.

15:05:55
<transcript>: looks

15:05:57
<transcript>: Looks look at the example value.

15:05:57
<transcript>: visual

15:05:59
<transcript>: Visual.

15:05:59
<transcript>: some

15:06:01
<transcript>: Some summary.

15:06:01
<transcript>: detail

15:06:02
<transcript>: Detail.

15:06:05
<transcript>: Yeah. A cnototype.

15:06:06
<transcript>: Okay.

15:06:09
<transcript>: So how do I know we're.

15:06:12
<transcript>: How do I know? How do I know.

15:06:24
<transcript>: Well, I can assume on this page we're getting a game, so I know what the shape of the data is gonna be.

15:06:24
<transcript>: yeah

15:06:26
<transcript>: Yeah, I know what the shape is.

15:06:26
<transcript>: i

15:06:28
<transcript>: I know what it is.

15:06:37
<transcript>: So much I'm not gonna copy all that.

15:06:45
dnbull: How are you getting the sports API did you guys build it?

15:06:45
<transcript>: I don't think it's accurate. I think it's got all the different shapes in there.

15:06:49
<transcript>: Yeah.

15:06:51
<transcript>: It does.

15:06:54
<transcript>: Let's see.

15:06:54
<transcript>: let's

15:06:57
<transcript>: Let's go back here.

15:06:59
<transcript>: And.

15:07:03
<transcript>: Let's do this.

15:07:10
<transcript>: This is actually the shape right here.

15:07:10
<transcript>: so i'm gonna

15:07:12
<transcript>: So I'm gonna do.

15:07:15
<transcript>: That like that.

15:07:17
<transcript>: I'm gonna make a new.

15:07:17
<transcript>: want to make a new

15:07:19
<transcript>: Want to make a new one.

15:07:26
<transcript>: Camera We're gonna call it exports interface gamera, game.

15:07:30
<transcript>: Just game gamer game.

15:07:35
<transcript>: Answer, I think, is what they call an on the backend.

15:07:35
<transcript>: and

15:07:37
<transcript>: And then it's gonna have.

15:07:39
<transcript>: A lot of stuff.

15:07:43
<transcript>: One of the things that's gonna have is detail.

15:07:43
<transcript>: the shape

15:07:45
<transcript>: The shape.

15:07:46
<transcript>: Okay.

15:07:46
<transcript>: oh

15:07:49
<transcript>: Oh, and that that's thing that has rose.

15:07:57
<transcript>: This summer, right here. This is actually a gamera Grid, so I can do this and say, gamera grid.

15:07:57
<transcript>: yes

15:07:58
<transcript>: Yes.

15:08:03
<transcript>: Teen detail? What is all this player detail.

15:08:08
nexxeln: you switched you scene by mistake i think

15:08:14
<transcript>: I have Damra grid.

15:08:14
<transcript>: what

15:08:14
nexxeln: oh its back

15:08:16
<transcript>: What? How'd that happen.

15:08:21
<transcript>: Oh, wait. What.

15:08:25
<transcript>: Weird.

15:08:25
<transcript>: what's happening

15:08:27
<transcript>: What's happening.

15:08:31
<transcript>: I switched the scene.

15:08:35
cowfacedude99: @nexxeln guess you saw the cam from behind the monitor

15:08:37
<transcript>: Can you see? Oh, yeah, yeah, no, I just have it go to that little all trying to do every once in a while.

15:08:42
<transcript>: Just a little wrinkle.

15:08:42
<transcript>: threw in a little wrinkle

15:08:44
nexxeln: ohh

15:08:46
<transcript>: Threw in a little wrinkle. You know, I think we're the follow smud Ward.

15:08:46
nexxeln: interesting

15:08:50
<transcript>: So what's odd to me.

15:08:50
<transcript>: where did i

15:08:53
<transcript>: Where did I get this detail thing from.

15:08:53
<transcript>: oh i

15:08:56
<transcript>: Oh, I had already. It's something I'd already worked on. Okay, okay.

15:09:00
<transcript>: So this this here is a number.

15:09:06
<transcript>: This is probably some more specific thing than string, but we're just gonna leave it string right now.

15:09:08
<transcript>: Home team.

15:09:08
<transcript>: this is

15:09:11
<transcript>: This is what is this.

15:09:11
<transcript>: this is

15:09:13
<transcript>: This is just a custom shape.

15:09:17
<transcript>: Number. String. Strange thing. Okay, that's a gamera entity.

15:09:20
<transcript>: That is a number.

15:09:20
<transcript>: for getting it

15:09:26
<transcript>: For getting it. We're just getting our type right here in typescript. Summary is a gamer grid.

15:09:26
<transcript>: team

15:09:28
<transcript>: Team detail.

15:09:29
<transcript>: What.

15:09:34
<transcript>: Bold shots, penalty minutes. Okay, those are all strings. That's fine.

15:09:38
<transcript>: That's fine.

15:09:38
<transcript>: there detail

15:09:41
<transcript>: There detail. Okay, those are grids. Great.

15:09:41
<transcript>: scoring

15:09:44
<transcript>: Scoring Summary period.

15:09:44
<transcript>: times

15:09:47
<transcript>: Times. Okay, these just need to be numbers.

15:09:57
<transcript>: I think that's it. So now I just need to wrap it in all the other stuff. That's just the visual detail.

15:09:57
<transcript>: so

15:09:58
<transcript>: So it's like visual.

15:10:02
<transcript>: Right.

15:10:08
<transcript>: Like that. So that's visual detail.

15:10:08
<transcript>: now let's

15:10:12
<transcript>: Now let's grab the rest of the shape. Oops.

15:10:15
<transcript>: The rest of the shape is.

15:10:15
<transcript>: what

15:10:17
<transcript>: What.

15:10:31
<transcript>: There are similar yeah, skimmer response. Basically this stuff.

15:10:36
<transcript>: Instead of the detail that summary.

15:10:36
<transcript>: there's

15:10:39
<transcript>: There's detail. So that's what's gonna go away.

15:10:43
<transcript>: Yank all that.

15:10:46
<transcript>: Oh.

15:10:53
<transcript>: This Claire is I guess I need all this stuff, too. So I'll have to come back here.

15:10:55
<transcript>: Details in a range.

15:10:55
<transcript>: of those

15:10:56
<transcript>: Of those things.

15:11:01
<transcript>: Red cribs on.

15:11:01
<transcript>: i'll find this typescript

15:11:02
<transcript>: I'll find this typescript.

15:11:05
<transcript>: Okay.

15:11:10
<transcript>: Detail. This is gonna be a.

15:11:10
badloop: Oh man, @adamdotdev what plugin are you using to keep the function name on the first line?

15:11:13
<transcript>: Like that. An array of them.

15:11:13
<transcript>: and then

15:11:16
<transcript>: And then we're gonna paste all of this stuff.

15:11:22
<transcript>: Here. So nlg. Okay, that. And then visual.

15:11:26
<transcript>: Summary. I'm gonna just collapse all that down.

15:11:33
<transcript>: Visual. Okay, I'm removing this visual. Oh, I'm gonna get so messed up, I'm gonna get so messed up.

15:11:33
<transcript>: that

15:11:39
<transcript>: That is to the visual. And then that is to the oh, is that it.

15:11:49
<transcript>: Okay, that's it badly. Oh, man, what plugin are you using to keep the function name on the first line? Oh, what is that? Is it context? Somebody tell me context. V of M or something.

15:11:56
<transcript>: It's so good. It's so very helpful. I don't remember what it's called, though. I think it's called context.

15:11:56
<transcript>: can someone

15:11:58
<transcript>: Can someone calf a should know.

15:12:01
<transcript>: I don't know if you're like actively around cafes but.

15:12:01
<transcript>: the plug

15:12:04
<transcript>: The plugin that keeps the name of the thing at the top.

15:12:06
<transcript>: Very helpful.

15:12:10
<transcript>: So gamer.

15:12:10
<transcript>: respond

15:12:11
<transcript>: Respond.

15:12:11
<transcript>: go back up

15:12:13
<transcript>: Go back up here.

15:12:18
<transcript>: We go.

15:12:18
<transcript>: so we got

15:12:19
laytanl_: nvim-treesitter-context

15:12:23
<transcript>: So we got that one. We got visual summary. We got visual detail.

15:12:23
<transcript>: now

15:12:27
<transcript>: Now we need all this is also in the visual.

15:12:29
<transcript>: Sync.

15:12:32
<transcript>: So.

15:12:36
<transcript>: Just keep copying. I bet all this is in there too.

15:12:41
<transcript>: And I'm just gonna have, like one incorrect.

15:12:43
<transcript>: Game.

15:12:43
<transcript>: one

15:12:47
<transcript>: One incorrect like squirrely bracket or something.

15:12:50
badloop: Many thanks!

15:12:51
<transcript>: It's gonna be painful, but I'm gonna figure it out.

15:12:55
<transcript>: Yeah. I think I just remove one bracket. More. Good.

15:12:59
<transcript>: Cool. So we have this kind of summary tokens.

15:13:03
<transcript>: That seems like that should be a boolean.

15:13:06
<transcript>: Disclaimer is a bunch of strength.

15:13:09
<transcript>: That should be a boolean as well.

15:13:14
<transcript>: There it is.

15:13:14
<transcript>: there is

15:13:18
<transcript>: There is our gamera answer or Game answer.

15:13:18
<transcript>: type

15:13:21
<transcript>: Type. I think it's good now.

15:13:25
<transcript>: You sit our context. There you go. Bad loop.

15:13:27
<transcript>: Hey, we help someone today.

15:13:27
<transcript>: what i just do

15:13:28
<transcript>: What I just do.

15:13:37
<transcript>: Okay, let's go back to this now. We know get game.

15:13:39
<transcript>: Is.

15:13:44
<transcript>: Oh, man, this nat. It's driving me crazy.

15:13:44
<transcript>: got me crazy

15:13:45
<transcript>: Got me crazy.

15:13:47
<transcript>: This is gonna return.

15:13:47
<transcript>: a certain

15:13:53
<transcript>: A certain shape. What does it say here? Gamer response. That's incorrect. Oh, it's right here.

15:13:57
<transcript>: This is gonna be gamera game answer.

15:14:04
<transcript>: Okay, cool.

15:14:06
<transcript>: Good.

15:14:06
<transcript>: go back

15:14:09
<transcript>: Go back to here.

15:14:09
<transcript>: and now

15:14:10
<transcript>: And now.

15:14:13
<transcript>: I got realtype safety.

15:14:13
<transcript>: as dax

15:14:16
<transcript>: As dax would say, I have full type safety.

15:14:21
<transcript>: Oh, no. Are there multiple details.

15:14:25
<transcript>: Is there multiple.

15:14:25
<transcript>: uhoh

15:14:27
<transcript>: Uhoh, I'm gonna just mess up the type.

15:14:27
<transcript>: as a detail

15:14:29
<transcript>: As a details different shape.

15:14:34
remixie: the only thing that is stopping me from switching to nvim permanently from vscode is the need to have a floating terminal window

15:14:44
remixie: thank you

15:14:48
<transcript>: First time chat. Welcome to Chat Remixy. The only thing that is stopping me from switching to Neil them permanently from bs code is the need to have a floating terminal window.

15:14:56
<transcript>: Floating terminal window. I'm sure calf Face has immediate answers. Probably latent. I used something called.

15:15:00
nexxeln: no you don't need that

15:15:03
badloop: You can absolutely have a floating term window

15:15:05
<transcript>: I don't remember what it's called toggle term is kind of bad. I mean, I didn't know it. Maybe it's not bad, but I didn't enjoy it.

15:15:05
<transcript>: frozen

15:15:06
badloop: But you dont need it

15:15:07
<transcript>: Frozen.

15:15:10
<transcript>: And smed. Thank you for follows. I don't know how I missed those.

15:15:10
<transcript>: i appreciate

15:15:12
<transcript>: I appreciate those follows.

15:15:14
nexxeln: just use tmux and use a normal terminal window

15:15:16
remixie: I only use one screen atm

15:15:20
<transcript>: No, you don't need that. Everyone's telling you you don't need it.

15:15:20
nexxeln: thats what i do

15:15:21
badloop: ^^ tmux ftw

15:15:22
remixie: that's why

15:15:27
<transcript>: She's team hux and use a normal terminal window. I only use one screen at the moment, so remixy here's what I do.

15:15:27
<transcript>: i'm gonna try

15:15:33
the_true_jinx: I use tmux with a horizontal split pane. You will be able to switch between panes faster than vscode

15:15:38
<transcript>: I'm gonna try and be a little more diplomatic. Here's what I do. I use tmux. And like, right now, I have this pain down here. This is my terminal pane. Oh, Geez.

15:15:38
<transcript>: let me see if

15:15:45
<transcript>: Let me see if I can actually Resize it. There we go. So here I've got two panes. Right. I'm using T. Max. I've got.

15:15:45
<transcript>: in them here

15:15:48
badloop: Tmux + a tiling WM = <3

15:15:48
remixie: hmm

15:15:49
<transcript>: In them here at the top. And I've got just a terminal window down here.

15:15:49
<transcript>: at the bottom

15:15:51
<transcript>: At the bottom, right.

15:15:55
laytanl_: I just use toggleterm and toggle the terminal anytime I need it

15:15:57
schrew: ew drag to resize

15:15:58
<transcript>: And that's where I'm running, like my Astro and the way I go back and forth and obviously like with Tmachs, you can make.

15:15:58
<transcript>: multiple i could

15:16:04
<transcript>: Multiple. I could make more terminal windows. Right. But the way I do it is.

15:16:12
<transcript>: Shut up. True. You drag this Resize. Yeah. I literally don't even know how to not drag to Resize.

15:16:15
nexxeln: you can even have two different windows in tmux, i personally don't like using panes because my screen in small

15:16:16
<transcript>: So then I just when I'm on an active window, like here.

15:16:16
<transcript>: i have

15:16:17
tnkhanh: tmux!!

15:16:33
<transcript>: I have like a key command for making it the only like zooming or whatever that's called in tmux. Make it like focus mode or something so I can toggle that on and off if I want to like just like I want to be working in this area. What am I doing? I'm sorry I said shut up. True. That was not very kind.

15:16:39
<transcript>: You see what I'm saying then I can just kind of toggle between having like full code view.

15:16:39
<transcript>: and

15:16:39
remixie: oh nice. havent heard of tmux until now

15:16:42
<transcript>: And not full code view.

15:16:42
<transcript>: yeah

15:16:46
<transcript>: Yeah. Anyway, timox, I recommend looking into it.

15:16:50
remixie: sounds good

15:16:52
remixie: thank you

15:16:58
<transcript>: You can even have two different Windows and tmax. Personally, I don't like using pains because my screen is small. Yeah, so I do like I do these things too. What are these called? These are called windows.

15:16:59
remixie: do you guys use asdf?

15:17:00
<transcript>: They use these as well.

15:17:03
<transcript>: So whatever these are called.

15:17:12
nexxeln: idk i call them windows

15:17:14
<transcript>: Asdf asdf like the keys key bindings for something.

15:17:14
<transcript>: or

15:17:15
schrew: forgiven! I'm actually the neovim newb, but just looked that one up recently. :res 20

15:17:16
<transcript>: Or something else.

15:17:17
remixie: no lol

15:17:23
tnkhanh: woo that is nice

15:17:27
<transcript>: On windows. Okay. So that's a window. And I know I can create a new one like that. And like that. And like that. And I can rename them like that. Just make sure I remember my key bindings.

15:17:29
<transcript>: Okay, cool.

15:17:29
<transcript>: i remember

15:17:30
<transcript>: I remember.

15:17:33

15:17:33
laytanl_: I use asdf for updating neovim

15:17:38
<transcript>: Forgiven. I'm actually the neovem. Noob, just looked that one up recently.

15:17:38
<transcript>: res

15:17:41
remixie: asdf-vm dot com

15:17:43
<transcript>: Res 20. So you're saying, if I do res.

15:17:45
<transcript>: 20.

15:17:47
<transcript>: What did that do.

15:17:47
<transcript>: what did that

15:17:48
tnkhanh: but how do you come back to previous view after a change to full screen view

15:17:49
<transcript>: What did that do.

15:17:53
<transcript>: How do I undo.

15:17:53
<transcript>: what did that do

15:17:55
<transcript>: What did that do.

15:17:55
remixie: it's to manage a bunch of different runtime versions

15:17:57
<transcript>: Res. 20.

15:18:02
cowfacedude99: what are you trying to do?

15:18:03
nexxeln: :res 0

15:18:04
nexxeln: maybe

15:18:07
<transcript>: To manage a bunch of different runtime versions. Wait. Oh, asdf is how do you come back to previously after I changed the full screen view. Oh, just same key bind it just toggles.

15:18:08
schrew: :res -20 LUL

15:18:12
<transcript>: But I do. I mean, I'm sure other people have other solutions.

15:18:12
<transcript>: res zero

15:18:16
<transcript>: Res zero. That's an intuitive oh res zero word.

15:18:22
nexxeln: LUL

15:18:24
<transcript>: Res 20, maybe -40 now. Oh, no, we are screwed.

15:18:24
<transcript>: minus

15:18:25
schrew: Increases the window size by 20 lines

15:18:26
<transcript>: -20.

15:18:30
remixie: OMEGALUL

15:18:31
remixie: rekt

15:18:31
tnkhanh: :res is resize

15:18:34
cowfacedude99: just use the mouse LUL

15:18:35
<transcript>: Increases the windows eyes by 20 lines. Okay, I'm just gonna kill Neovem. No, no.

15:18:42
<transcript>: Save that. And then I'm gonna do new of them again. And I bet things are better. Things are better, okay.

15:18:44
<transcript>: That's so funny.

15:18:47
<transcript>: Game layout. Here we are.

15:18:47
<transcript>: just use the mac

15:18:50
<transcript>: Just use the Mac. Good Call Cafe. That's what I do.

15:18:53
mgtwt: just code in one-liners from now on

15:18:53
<transcript>: That's what I do.

15:18:59
tnkhanh: :res +20

15:19:00
<transcript>: Let's see, let's see, let's see? I'm just catching up on some.

15:19:00
<transcript>: dms

15:19:01
tnkhanh: lol

15:19:01
<transcript>: Dms.

15:19:02
remixie: is there a settings sync for neovim?

15:19:11
nexxeln: yes its called github

15:19:16
cowfacedude99: @Remixie your dotfiles are the sync

15:19:21
<transcript>: Oh, thank you so much. Marcus sent me some information about the retroreflective material. I want to look into this because I'm gonna be doing more green screen work. Once we get rebase going, I'm gonna be hosting some rebates episodes. And I'm gonna be on a green screen. And the better that can look, the better.

15:19:24
<transcript>: Yeah.

15:19:24
<transcript>: that makes sense right

15:19:25
<transcript>: That makes sense, right.

15:19:31
<transcript>: Is there setting sync for new of them? Yes, I saw all of mine in GitHub.

15:19:35
adamdotdev: !dotfiles

15:19:36
fossabot: Adam's dotfiles live here: https://github.com/adamelmore/dotfiles The repository for bitter is here: https://github.com/adamelmore/bitter

15:19:36
badloop: Dotfiles ftw

15:19:40
<transcript>: Do I have a Dot Files command if you want to look at mine. Well, they're not very good. You should go to TJ.

15:19:45
<transcript>: Someone can someone link to you just kickstart in them. Just look up. Start.

15:19:45
adamdotdev: kickstart.nvim

15:19:51
<transcript>: In them. That's a great place to start. Oh, I don't know if that's actually a url. Probably not.

15:19:53
badloop: @remixie welcome to the next part of your life

15:19:54
<transcript>: Think envy is a tld, right? No.

15:19:54
<transcript>: okay

15:19:55
remixie: is there a streamlined way to pass them in?

15:19:55
<transcript>: Okay.

15:19:55
<transcript>: what was i doing

15:20:00
<transcript>: What was I doing? I was trying to figure out if I messed up the type. I think I messed up the type.

15:20:00
<transcript>: let's do this

15:20:01
nexxeln: https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim

15:20:02
<transcript>: Let's do this. Let's say.

15:20:02
<transcript>: let's go back

15:20:05
<transcript>: Let's go back to logging.

15:20:08
remixie: @badloop KEKW this along with learning rust and C++, ye

15:20:09
<transcript>: Log json string if I.

15:20:12
<transcript>: Data. No.

15:20:16
nexxeln: pass what in? @Remixie

15:20:18
cowfacedude99: you can start hunting in the maintainers dotfiles.

15:20:19
<transcript>: Let's go back here to refresh the page.

15:20:23
<transcript>: Okay. So what I want to know is, are there multiple.

15:20:27
<transcript>: Different shaped.

15:20:28
<transcript>: Objects.

15:20:30
cowfacedude99: and many of us have our own.

15:20:38
<transcript>: In this detail payload. It's a detail array. I need to know. Does it have different shapes? That I just wrongly type this thing.

15:20:41
<transcript>: So I just lie incorrectly.

15:20:41
<transcript>: to type script

15:20:42
<transcript>: To type script.

15:20:43
nexxeln: @badloop time of your life fr

15:20:45
remixie: whelp

15:20:45
<transcript>: It's the question.

15:20:45
<transcript>: okay

15:20:47
badloop: @remixie i give it about 2 months before you’re browsing custom built split ortholinear mechanical keyboards….

15:20:48
<transcript>: Okay, we're at the top. Almost.

15:20:53
<transcript>: Subject.

15:20:56
<transcript>: Okay, visual.

15:20:56
remixie: time to spend a whole day customizing nvim

15:20:57
<transcript>: Summary.

15:21:05
nexxeln: hell yeah good luck

15:21:09
<transcript>: Now we're scrolling back down. Here we go. Detail. The first one looks like the shape that I Typed. Cool Summary is gonna be a giant payload that is hard to make sense of. Team detail.

15:21:17
<transcript>: You have the salt checks out. This is what I saw, but is there another detail object in this array.

15:21:19
remixie: @badloop I tried the keeb life and I wasnt enough of an audiophile for it

15:21:22
remixie: sihaSip

15:21:22
<transcript>: Is the question. I could just like print the links of the array.

15:21:26
bubakek: maybe a JSON to typescript interface converter like transform.tools?

15:21:27
<transcript>: But I didn't. Did I? It's not what I did.

15:21:27
<transcript>: instead i'm

15:21:29
badloop: @remixie a good place to start finding out what you want is LazyVim … but in the end you probably want to write your config from scratch

15:21:30
<transcript>: Instead, I'm scrolling like an idiot.

15:21:30
<transcript>: here

15:21:32
<transcript>: Here I go. Still scrolling.

15:21:32
<transcript>: away

15:21:34
<transcript>: Away team.

15:21:38
<transcript>: Okay. What point do I cut bait and just.

15:21:40
<transcript>: And just move on.

15:21:40
<transcript>: still

15:21:45
<transcript>: Still scrolling. These grids are verbose. That's a big ol json payload.

15:21:45
thdxr: just put aside 1-2 hours and watch prime's video and step through it

15:21:46
badloop: Haha lulz @ audiophile

15:21:48
<transcript>: Look at that. Go.

15:21:48
<transcript>: okay

15:21:50
<transcript>: Okay. Here we go.

15:21:50
<transcript>: type

15:21:53
dimpopo: 1000/46830 zzzScared

15:21:54
<transcript>: Type mba Historical box Score they do have a type.

15:21:54

15:23:31
<transcript>: Oh, Snap, am I close to 30 followers? I have done something cool for each of my thousand mile markers on Twitter.

15:23:31
<transcript>: do we want to

15:23:34
<transcript>: Do we want to do something cool again.

15:23:34
<transcript>: probably

15:23:35
<transcript>: Probably.

15:23:42
<transcript>: When I've done things cool in the past. Cool things where people getting things giveaways.

15:23:42
<transcript>: so

15:23:44
<transcript>: So I'll have to think about that.

15:23:48
<transcript>: Do you guys use Omazi's primes mapping options.

15:23:50
jenswoeste: I also use VHS. So many episodes of 90210 stored there.

15:23:57
<transcript>: Okay. So what I'm wondering is if I use something like Transform tools. Would it I'm pulling this up.

15:24:00
<transcript>: It keeps opening in the rom browser. So let's just do this.

15:24:00
<transcript>: transform

15:24:02
<transcript>: Transform.

15:24:07
<transcript>: Tools. I wonder if it does sophisticated things.

15:24:09
<transcript>: To type script.

15:24:15
<transcript>: Oh, there it was two typescript. Json to typescript.

15:24:19
<transcript>: Like what happens if you put a okay, let's just try.

15:24:24
<transcript>: Let's just try. Oh, I can't copy this whole thing. How would I copy this whole thing.

15:24:32
<transcript>: Can I copy this whole thing? Maybe let's try.

15:24:35
thdxr: shift+v then capital G

15:24:38
<transcript>: How fast can I scroll? Not fast enough.

15:24:43
thdxr: ADAM STOP WTF

15:24:46
thdxr: You're using neovim

15:24:51
privann: ^^^

15:24:55
<transcript>: That is so slow. What do we think? Do we want to watch that countdown from 2000 to zero? You know what I do? And the way I'm gonna do it is, I'm just gonna tie shift G a shift V than capital G. This is neo Van. That's not. This is just a terminal output.

15:24:55
<transcript>: this isn't

15:24:57
<transcript>: This isn't neovem.

15:24:58
<transcript>: No, no.

15:24:58
<transcript>: it's okay

15:24:59
schrew: this is a war crime

15:25:00
thdxr: oh lol

15:25:03
<transcript>: It's okay. We're gonna make use of this time. I'm just gonna use this as time to chat.

15:25:04
thdxr: but you can do this in tmux also

15:25:06
tnkhanh: u can use tmux copy mode

15:25:08
icedcoffefe: my eyes

15:25:14
<transcript>: This is just time to talk. I normally spend half the time talking anyway. Might as well do it while I'm holding down my very sketchy trackpad that I'm surely gonna let go of on accident.

15:25:16
remixie: sihaSip

15:25:19
<transcript>: This is awesome. This is a war crime.

15:25:19
<transcript>: you can do

15:25:29
<transcript>: You can do this in tmux also. Well, by the time I learned how to do it next, I could have just held this down for three minutes. I mean, come on, you can use tmux copy mode.

15:25:30
schrew: is the pipe operator nothing to you

15:25:32
<transcript>: You guys enjoying the banana screen. This is like.

15:25:32
<transcript>: just i

15:25:43
<transcript>: fil

15:25:43
thdxr: I'm going to send a video of you doing this to statmuse investors

15:25:46
sasankthapa: how many lines are there...

15:25:47
<transcript>: File system stuff. And like, write it to something.

15:25:54
<transcript>: Send the video of me doing this. The satin's Investors. I'm so funny.

<transcript>: There's only 600 more lines. Calm down, guys.

15:26:05
<transcript>: sweet

15:26:07
<transcript>: Sweet relief.

15:26:12

nikolaxhristov: :D

15:26:24
<transcript>: I'm almost done it's almost done, Josh style. Thank you so much for the follow Josh. Was it the banana screen did me scrolling for 30 lines and my team is that what did it for you? You're like, gotta follow this guy.

15:26:27
<transcript>: hundred

15:26:28
joshstyle1: no worries adam

15:26:30
<transcript>: Hundred lines left. Here we go. Homestretch.

15:26:35
<transcript>: Oh, I gotta start slowing down? Even I don't want to get too much text.

15:26:35
<transcript>: now do i know

15:26:36
privann: im starting to grow gray hair from watching you copy this

15:26:38
<transcript>: Now do I know how to copy? Once I have selected.

15:26:42
<transcript>: Oh, no. Is it cut off? I think it's cut off.

15:26:46
<transcript>: Oh no no.

15:26:46
thdxr: LOL

15:26:47
<transcript>: What.

15:26:47
<transcript>: it just went

15:26:50
jenswoeste: LUL

15:26:54
<transcript>: It just went away. Did it copy it? Did it copy it? We're about to find out. Josh, welcome to chat.

15:26:55
cowfacedude99: this is fun

15:26:56
thdxr: of course

15:26:58
<transcript>: I'm gonna try oh, where am I? Here we go.

15:27:00
<transcript>: Did it work.

15:27:01
kainthegame1: :P output to file ;)

15:27:04
nikolaxhristov: NotLikeThis

15:27:07
flomzey: which programming languages are you able to code in?

15:27:11
thdxr: it's gonna crash transform.tools

15:27:11
<transcript>: It worked. I just. It's not. It's not complete. Oh, I think it's just missing the. Wait. I'm doing anything. I think it's just literally missing the end bracket. Oh, my word. It worked.

15:27:11
<transcript>: look at this

15:27:12
<transcript>: Look at this.

15:27:17
thdxr: wow

15:27:17
<transcript>: So worth it you all doubted me well, I guess I could have got the same result.

15:27:19
vapor__dev: this is one of those bell curve memes of the noob, mid, then master

15:27:21
<transcript>: It's gonna crash. Now, look, it's working.

15:27:21
<transcript>: maybe

15:27:30
<transcript>: Maybe. Let's see. Answer two. Oh, this is gonna it's gonna be a little rough, but it might. No, this is pretty rough. What.

15:27:30
<transcript>: in one

15:27:33
<transcript>: In one through in four. What.

15:27:35
tnkhanh: we never doubt Adam Kreygasm

15:27:37
thdxr: wait why do you need seperate interfaces?

15:27:37
<transcript>: Did it do I'm not smart enough to even know what it did.

15:27:39
<transcript>: Thank you for the following.

15:27:39
nikolaxhristov: you can cat the whole file to xclip

15:27:41
<transcript>: Ck on chill.

15:27:50
<transcript>: Wait. Why do you need separate interfaces? So what? I want, dax, is. I want.

15:27:56
<transcript>: I don't need separate interfaces. Is there an option? Because what I want is just the shape of this.

15:27:56
<transcript>: response

15:27:59
<transcript>: Response, this network response.

15:27:59
<transcript>: i did not

15:28:01
<transcript>: I did not need it broken up like this.

15:28:01
<transcript>: but this is showing

15:28:04
nikolaxhristov: pbcopy < /file

15:28:08
bubakek: maybe in settings?

15:28:08
<transcript>: But this is showing what it would, I guess is kind of helpful. Every time I use an nlg, I'll just have this in LG interface.

15:28:08
<transcript>: i don't know

15:28:13
<transcript>: I don't know. I kind of like it now. It grew on me. Is this good.

15:28:17
<transcript>: Is this good.

15:28:22
<transcript>: Is it good that it's some separate interfaces that you know, typescript. What do you think.

15:28:26
<transcript>: I could probably change create monotype. Is that what this is.

15:28:30
<transcript>: Oh, that's what it is. Look, now, it's a monotype.

15:28:30
<transcript>: okay

15:28:32
<transcript>: Okay. So I'll just do this.

15:28:34
cowfacedude99: I regret telling you to use mouse

15:28:35
nexxeln: i think thats good

15:28:35
<transcript>: Entity.

15:28:35
<transcript>: string

15:28:36
vapor__dev: https://imgflip.com/i/7dl9dj

15:28:39
<transcript>: String. Let's see. Visual Domain summary.

15:28:40
thdxr: it's good that it's in seperat einterfaces but then it had to guess the names of them which it didn't do well

15:28:42
thdxr: but you can rename them

15:28:45
<transcript>: What I want to see is the detail. Yeah. Here we go. Array of.

15:28:48
<transcript>: But they're not all that tight.

15:28:50
nikolaxhristov: @vapor__dev LUL

15:28:53
<transcript>: You see is the problem.

15:28:57
<transcript>: Why.

15:29:03
<transcript>: Team.

15:29:03
<transcript>: so where's the

15:29:05
<transcript>: So Where's the end of this array.

15:29:09
<transcript>: Oh, it's a it's a it's.

15:29:09
<transcript>: not using

15:29:13
<transcript>: Not using brackets. It's using array. And then like a generic.

15:29:15
<transcript>: Oh.

15:29:15
<transcript>: so

15:29:19
<transcript>: So. Okay, can I collapse these? Oh, I can clap some. I'm so dumb.

15:29:21
<transcript>: Oh, man.

15:29:26
<transcript>: That doesn't collapse like I thought I would.

15:29:26
<transcript>: want to collapse the whole

15:29:27
tnkhanh: I can't use mouse :(

15:29:29
<transcript>: Want to collapse the whole subject. Here we go. Narrator.

15:29:33
<transcript>: Now I'm just stubborn. Why won't you collapse.

15:29:37
<transcript>: Okay so detail.

15:29:37
<transcript>: i

15:29:39
<transcript>: I can't even click on these anymore.

15:29:52
<transcript>: It's good that it's in separate interfaces, but then it has to guess the names of them, which it didn't do too well, but you can rename them. Yeah. I think the separate was probably good. Yeah. Okay.

15:29:52
<transcript>: you can

15:29:54
<transcript>: You can't face your grits telling me to use mouse.

15:29:54
<transcript>: you guys are

15:30:02
<transcript>: You guys are still trying to solve how to copy all that text. Listen, people, I already did it. I did it. I copied it all.

15:30:05
<transcript>: Your pb copy and your.

15:30:05
<transcript>: xclipp

15:30:07
<transcript>: Xclippin. I got it.

15:30:07
<transcript>: cop

15:30:13
<transcript>: Copied it all before you even set that stuff. I think maybe. I don't know, actually.

15:30:16
nikolaxhristov: but are you sure it's the whole file

15:30:17
<transcript>: No, I appreciate your smart tips. I'm just not very smart.

15:30:17
<transcript>: okay

15:30:17
tnkhanh: @vapor__dev lol

15:30:20
<transcript>: Okay. So we should go with the separate.

15:30:20
<transcript>: are

15:30:20
thdxr: I already rewrote all of statmuse

15:30:23
thdxr: in linux

15:30:33
<transcript>: Are you sure it's the whole file? I'm positive. Yeah. I knew that the end of it looked like this. I knew that. So I don't know why I had a comma here and then no empty bracket, but I figured it out. So we're gonna go with the split interfaces.

15:30:36
<transcript>: Because we think that's better.

15:30:39
vapor__dev: sstackmuse

15:30:40
bubakek: you can separate some interfaces as long as you need it, no need to separate full depth

15:30:41
<transcript>: And this is gonna be my new interface.

15:30:46
<transcript>: My confidence is low, my confidence is low that I'm actually gonna get this working.

15:30:50
<transcript>: Let's see, I.

15:30:50
<transcript>: want to go back

15:30:52
<transcript>: Want to go back to the.

15:30:57
<transcript>: Where is the type.

15:31:00
<transcript>: Camera game.

15:31:06
<transcript>: This is going to be my new.

<transcript>: gamera game

15:31:09
<transcript>: Gamera game answer right.

15:31:13
<transcript>: Okay.

15:31:20
<transcript>: Figure out how I would do this.

15:31:22
<transcript>: Here we go.

15:31:33
<transcript>: So in LG I guess I do have nlg like all over the place, don't I? There's 26 of them in this file. I'm so dumb. I should have done this so long ago.

15:31:37
<transcript>: Thanks so much.

15:31:44
<transcript>: Let's see I already rewrote all the statuses in Linux.

15:31:46
<transcript>: It's probably true.

15:31:49
hpwebcamable: Forgive my dumb question but what is a gamera

15:31:54
<transcript>: Stack, muse ss? T AC AC acume. I see what you did there.

15:32:00
<transcript>: You can separate some interfaces as long as you need it. No need to separate full depth. Okay, okay.

15:32:04
<transcript>: Oh, no, not a dumb question at all. Welcome to Chad. Hp.

15:32:04

<transcript>: Service.

15:32:08
<transcript>: so sap

15:32:18

15:32:18
<transcript>: the part

15:32:25
<transcript>: The part that parses all the English and figures out how to answer it is called gamera. We named all of our services after.

15:32:33
<transcript>: Godzilla monsters. So we have mothra and gamera and Tachycoma, and.

15:32:33
<transcript>: nagin

<transcript>: Okay.

15:32:52
<transcript>: let's

15:33:00
<transcript>: Let's see summary. Nlg. These are different. So nlg okay, we're gonna have this nld thing.

15:33:16
<transcript>: Is just text and ssml. I don't think I need to have a text here because I don't think that shows up ever outside of this thing. And I don't same thing with ssml that can all just be one thing. But I'm gonna have an nlg interface. This feels good.

15:33:16
<transcript>: feels

15:33:18
<transcript>: Feels real good.

15:33:21
<transcript>: So good actually.

15:33:21

15:35:03
<transcript>: okay

15:35:04
<transcript>: Okay.

15:35:14
<transcript>: That's what nlg looks like. It's got text which has an answer which has that stuff. So if I like, look up this word, I bet it's in here a few times.

15:35:19
<transcript>: That's actually where we use it. Okay, here. Summary, tokens.

15:35:22
<transcript>: Oh.

15:35:22
<transcript>: is that that's

15:35:25
<transcript>: Is that that's a different usage of it.

15:35:28
<transcript>: Well, that's okay.

15:35:35
<transcript>: Next tsun? What's that.

15:35:35
<transcript>: next

15:35:38
<transcript>: Next dot ts. Is that a domain you're gonna get.

15:35:38
<transcript>: is ts

15:35:41
<transcript>: Is tsa tld.

15:35:41
<transcript>: can you get

15:35:43
<transcript>: Can you get ts domains.

15:35:43
<transcript>: side of thing

15:35:45
<transcript>: Side of thing.

15:35:48
<transcript>: Also thank you for the follow astro. I didn't see that.

15:35:51
nikolaxhristov: sadly no

15:35:56
spotmonk: far.ts

15:35:58
<transcript>: Okay. So it has an nlg, and then a visual is visual always the same.

15:36:02
<transcript>: That is the question domain summary detail.

15:36:05
nexxeln: no its something i gonna make when i have an idea of what i wanna make LUL

15:36:05
<transcript>: Summary tokens is superlative.

15:36:05
<transcript>: and additional

15:36:07
<transcript>: And additional questions.

15:36:10
<transcript>: I don't know if that's all.

15:36:11
oskrm: nope, twitch logic anything with a dot must be d.omain

15:36:13
nexxeln: cause i don't wanna make another framework

15:36:16
<transcript>: So detail is the thing that shape differently depending on.

15:36:16
<transcript>: the response

15:36:17
<transcript>: The response.

15:36:17
remixie: according to wikipedia, no

15:36:22
<transcript>: How does it handle it? Here. Detail.

15:36:25
<transcript>: What.

15:36:27
astrojules: @oskrM LM.AO

15:36:27
<transcript>: See that's not accurate.

15:36:31
<transcript>: That's just based on this one. Okay, okay.

15:36:31
astrojules: damn :(

15:36:36
<transcript>: So I think the visual I need to just inline.

15:36:37
oskrm: @astrojules lm.ao

15:36:41
remixie: dz.nuts

15:36:41
<transcript>: Okay to justify making this nl. Do you think I should go back.

15:36:44
<transcript>: And I should replace.

15:36:44
<transcript>: anywhere else

15:36:45
astrojules: oh case sensitive

15:36:48
<transcript>: Anywhere else that you're uses it oh, there's nowhere else use it.

15:36:51
<transcript>: Here we go.

15:36:51
<transcript>: so

15:36:52
nikolaxhristov: @Remixie oh

<transcript>: You guys with your funny domains.

15:37:28
remixie: I wanted to get the domain remix.ie but ie is for Ireland residents only

15:37:31
<transcript>: Twitter Logic anything with a dot must be a domain.

15:37:34
<transcript>: That's funny Oscar.

15:37:40
<transcript>: You people are funny.

15:37:40
oskrm: adam has adam.tv which is super cool

nikolaxhristov: same deal

15:37:45
nikolaxhristov: :D

15:37:57
<transcript>: I wanted to get the domain remixy, but Ie is for Ireland residents only. Interesting is that like Ireland residents only, but you can lie and it's not a huge deal, just like puts on Ireland address on there. Or is it like they will come after you.

15:37:57
<transcript>: because i know some

15:38:26
<transcript>: that was that was

15:38:31
<transcript>: That was that was a terrible guess. Proof of residency in Ireland. That's some serious stuff.

15:38:31
nikolaxhristov: no no it's cool

15:38:32
marcusbuer: brazil = br

<transcript>: It actually, it physically hurts my brain.

15:39:09
privann: you can make everything happen

15:39:14
<transcript>: If you know rust. I don't know rust. We did spend a little time on stream. When.

15:39:22
nexxeln: they're the god of the internet they can make it happen

15:39:22

15:40:25
livemahs: learning a new codebase at work currently!

15:40:33
<transcript>: But if you've watched me on stream, you know it's simply not true. I don't mostly do backend. I think I'm a backend engineer, but I spent most of my time doing frontend because I'm so slow at it.

15:40:33
<transcript>: targeting

15:40:37
<transcript>: Targeting a senior level position so back in senior level.

15:40:38

15:40:45
oskrm: @LiveMahs oof

<transcript>: done that

15:41:11
<transcript>: Done that a few times.

15:41:13
remixie: since I've been working for smallish companies before

15:41:17
remixie: and I need experience with scaling

15:41:24
<transcript>: Last place was mastery logistic systems targeting medium to large companies so I can learn more. Yeah, that makes sense since I've been working for smallish companies before and I experienced the scaling. So it's interesting. Remixy. I did all.

15:41:24
<transcript>: youtube video

15:41:26
<transcript>: Youtube video which no one watched.

15:41:26
<transcript>: but

15:41:32
<transcript>: But it was about why you probably shouldn't join a startup. And I'm someone who's only worked at startups.

15:41:32
<transcript>: so

15:41:36
<transcript>: So why would I say you probably shouldn't join a startup? Because I think there are.

15:41:36
<transcript>: two good

15:41:38
remixie: sihaSit startups are okay

15:41:39
tayloreddev: i watched it

15:41:39
privann: I work as a software engineer at Zimpler in Sweden, doing Fintech stuffs. Building a bank-integration. So pretty much adding support for more banks to our service

15:41:45
<transcript>: Two good paths as a software developer. Path number one work for big companies, make a lot of money over time and be happy in life. Path Number two.

15:41:45
<transcript>: start

15:41:48
<transcript>: Start a startup.

15:41:48
<transcript>: whole different

15:41:56
oskrm: be happy Sadge

15:41:57
<transcript>: Whole different experience. Probably not make a lot of money, have a lot of fun. Get to like shape the world just a little bit how you want to see it.

15:42:01
<transcript>: And then maybe it flames out. Maybe it keeps going, whatever.

15:42:01
<transcript>: but door

15:42:07
<transcript>: But door number three is like, go work for a startup. Get all the downsides of starting a startup.

15:42:07
<transcript>: in the sense that

15:42:11
livemahs: yeah, going from an old asp, c# stack to a aws, docker, java, spring boot stack. just kinda wading into it at this point

15:42:20
<transcript>: In the sense that like it could just vaporize at any moment. And it's chaos. And you're not really learning software development so much as you're learning how to be in a startup and function.

15:42:31
<transcript>: But like with none of the upside of if the thing does make it you have this huge windfall. I mean, you might like if it makes it really big and you're really early. But that's just so rare.

15:42:31
<transcript>: so

15:42:34
<transcript>: So. Oh, Taylor, you watched my videos. Thank you so much.

15:42:34
<transcript>: yeah

15:42:37
<transcript>: Yeah. I just think like.

15:42:37
<transcript>: either work

15:42:48
<transcript>: Either work at a big company or start a small company. But like working for a tiny startup, you got to really be excited about the mission and feel like you can uniquely grow in that role in enjoy life.

15:42:48
<transcript>: or it's just kind of

15:42:54
<transcript>: Or it's just kind of a bad deal for you. Like the amount of energy and employee gets at a startup.

15:42:56
astrojules: this camera quality wow smolPanic

15:43:03
<transcript>: And the rate of failure for startups. Yeah. It's in experience. Maybe you just do it for the experience, but I don't know. I don't recommend it.

15:43:03
<transcript>: i

15:43:03
mattmancodes: 100%

15:43:06
remixie: I have to go for now but thank you for the advice

15:43:07
<transcript>: I say just start one. If you want to work at a startup, just make one.

15:43:07
<transcript>: i work

15:43:14
astrojules: i am working at a small company with about 10 employees :p

15:43:19
<transcript>: I work as a software engineer at zimmer in Sweden doing fintech stuff. I did some index stuff in my day building a bank integration, so pretty much adding support for more banks. I did this kind of stuff provon. I work for a company called Market access.

15:43:19
<transcript>: in new york

15:43:21
<transcript>: In New York.

15:43:21
<transcript>: i didn't live

15:43:29
<transcript>: I didn't live in New York. I lived in the ozarks remotely again. Life hack live in a cheap place. Work for people inexpensive places.

15:43:31
<transcript>: It's a good deal.

15:43:31
<transcript>: so

15:43:35
<transcript>: So I did work for market Access. I built a ton of integrations with fix.

15:43:35
<transcript>: i think

15:43:38
<transcript>: I think back then it was six, four, four.

15:43:38
<transcript>: i was writing

15:43:41
tnkhanh: I need funding first for my startup

15:43:42
<transcript>: I was writing a lot of fix adapters to connect banks.

15:43:48
<transcript>: Trading fixed income stuff. Thanks so much for the follow. It's brune.

15:43:56
itsbr00n: You are most welcome!

15:43:58
nikolaxhristov: @tnkhanh what do you do

15:44:00
<transcript>: Going from an old ASP sharp stack to an aws Docker java spring BootStack just kind of waiting into it at this point. That sounds nice. It's always fun to kind of like transition.

15:44:00
<transcript>: tech stacks

15:44:03
<transcript>: Tech stacks and to learn from people who.

15:44:03
<transcript>: know that

15:44:07
<transcript>: Know that tech stack stack kind of leap ahead a lot.

15:44:09
vapor__dev: were you doing a 4th path when you were contracting a lot? did you like that more than a big company?

15:44:23
<transcript>: I have to go now remix it's so nice to see you hope to see you again sometimes soon I'll be streaming every day this week if you find the time would love to hang again. Thank you for the follow remixy. I appreciate that astro. I'm working at a small company with about ten employees.

15:44:23
<transcript>: yeah that's a small

15:44:24
<transcript>: Yeah, that's a small company.

15:44:24
<transcript>: and

15:44:30
livemahs: how long have you been writing code?

15:44:34
<transcript>: And it can make sense for some people. I'm not trying to tell everybody they're wrong for working in the startup. I just think like the risk reward ratio.

15:44:34
<transcript>: it's so skewed

15:44:36
<transcript>: It's so skewed as an employee, that.

15:44:48
<transcript>: I don't know. Maybe like it's. Maybe I'm speaking from privilege to be like, just go start a startup because it kind of worked out for me. I know it's not easy to just start a startup like, you gotta find people to give you money and all that stuff.

15:44:48
<transcript>: but

15:44:49
oskrm: I'm workin on implementing a tax e-invoice xml specification that is complicated for no reason

15:44:54
<transcript>: But I think there's a lot of benefits. I think we frown on working at big companies.

15:44:54
<transcript>: in my little circle

15:45:00
<transcript>: In my little circle of the Internet, like where we all do startup stuff. But I think it's actually a pretty good gig. You get paid really well.

15:45:00
<transcript>: you paid like a

15:45:02
<transcript>: You paid like a doctor.

15:45:04
<transcript>: Yeah.

15:45:04
<transcript>: i've never worked

15:45:07
the_true_jinx: did you have a startup? please tell about it

15:45:08
<transcript>: I've never worked at a big company. I kind of wonder what it's like.

15:45:17
<transcript>: You need funding T and K for your first startup or for your wait. I need funding first for my startup. Yes.

15:45:17
<transcript>: are you

15:45:20
<transcript>: Are you like all in tnk.

15:45:32
<transcript>: Are you like, you're doing this and you need funding or it's like, if somebody approached you and was like, I'll give you money, then you'd be like, I'll build it. Which one? I'm just curious. There's no wrong answer.

15:45:35
zachrip: Ope I thought you worked at amazon at some point

15:45:39
<transcript>: Vape or dev? Were you doing a fourth path when you were contracting a lot? Did you like that? More than a big company.

15:45:39
<transcript>: so

15:45:41
astrojules: yeah i'd like to eventually move onto something slightly bigger as i've just started my SWE career after college - only 24 :p

15:45:43
<transcript>: So. Yeah, I guess. Yeah. That's another path. So freelance.

15:45:43
<transcript>: like independ

15:45:47
<transcript>: Like independent stuff, consulting stuff. I think some of the opportunities open up more.

15:45:47
<transcript>: later

15:45:49
tnkhanh: lol, if someone gives me money first,

15:45:51
<transcript>: Later in your career when you've done a lot of different things.

15:45:51
<transcript>: so like

15:46:01
<transcript>: So like, I did a lot of advising startups and consulting. That stuff I couldn't have done as being in my career. I didn't have an experience and nobody wanted to hear what I had to say. But.

15:46:01
<transcript>: i did have

15:46:01
traylortrash84: I would work for Adam.

15:46:09
zachrip: I started a business so that I could move to the Netherlands but it's not a "startup"

15:46:14
<transcript>: I did have some good opportunities with that is pretty lucrative and pretty like easy compared to being like an individual contributor. So that is a pass. And then there's freelance like just being a freelance.

15:46:14
<transcript>: like

15:46:20
<transcript>: Like early and career. I did freelance stuff like actually implementing building sites or building apps or whatever.

15:46:20
<transcript>: that

15:46:25
gerellt: I know one day I'll make a startup but I'm focusing on learning good software engineering first. I've got 10 years as a real estate broker on my belt. Only 3 years as a dev.

15:46:28
tnkhanh: when I hear startup, is it like always SWE

15:46:29
<transcript>: That's definitely a path. But I think, like, if you're gonna have a fulltime job, that's what I was mostly speaking to, like, if you're gonna work for one person, one company.

15:46:29
0xcouch: Saw your spicy take on Rails last week after DHH's infra tweets. What are your actual thoughts on Rails these days?

15:46:35
<transcript>: I think those are the two paths I would pick between big companies or start my own.

15:46:47
<transcript>: Work on implementing a tax emvoice xml specification that is complicated for no reason. Well, that sounds complicated for reasons that I understand, like taxes.

15:46:47
<transcript>: and

15:46:49
<transcript>: And XML.

15:46:59
<transcript>: I am easy. Thanks so much for the follow. Did you have a startup? Please tell about I yeah, true links true jinx I still have startup Sam use.

15:46:59
<transcript>: we

15:47:02
mjewl: I started in a huge global corporation, them moved to a small/mid size company and now been doing startup for the last 8 years or something.

15:47:03
<transcript>: We started it eight years ago. Now my cofounder and I.

15:47:03
<transcript>: which is crazy

15:47:04
<transcript>: Which is crazy.

15:47:04
<transcript>: that it's

15:47:09
<transcript>: That it's still going eight years later. I would not have expected that.

15:47:09
<transcript>: i

15:47:09
privann: @adamdotdev Yeah fintech is fun tbh. I like it. we mostly write GO. did you do the famous java when you worked in fintech

15:47:15
<transcript>: I would have thought we would have just probably exited and gotten quite acquired before in eight year window.

15:47:15
<transcript>: inside

15:47:18
<transcript>: Inside that eightyear window. But we didn't. We almost did.

15:47:18
<transcript>: yeah

15:47:23
<transcript>: Yeah. We started eight years ago. We went like a year before we raised our first.

15:47:23
<transcript>: vc fund

15:47:25
<transcript>: Vc funding.

15:47:25
<transcript>: and then

15:47:26
<transcript>: And then.

15:47:26
<transcript>: went on a pretty

15:47:37
nexxeln: what is statmuse valued at right now?

15:47:37
<transcript>: Went on a pretty crazy ride for a few years. There raise money from Disney and Google. It got pretty exciting. We got to meet a lot of athletes and do a lot of cool things in sports with teams.

15:47:37
<transcript>: and

15:47:41
dnbull: how are you getting the sports data?

15:47:42
nikolaxhristov: parties

15:47:46
<transcript>: And League people. And it was it was pretty fun. Now we're in kind of like a more mature stage of the company where we settled in a bit.

15:47:46
<transcript>: we

15:47:49
oskrm: @privann hows Go in Sweden?

15:47:51
<transcript>: We kind of have, like, a ton of traffic on our Samus.com property.

15:47:54
<transcript>: We're trying to figure out how to turn that into.

15:47:57
<transcript>: A healthier revenue position.

15:48:02
<transcript>: Anyway, I thought you worked at Amazon at some point. No, I'm just really into AWS.

15:48:02
<transcript>: i've never worked

15:48:03
<transcript>: I've never worked.

15:48:08
<transcript>: At aws. I appreciate the Oak though. That's nice hope. I thought you worked.

15:48:15
<transcript>: I'd like to eventually move on to something slightly bigger as I've just started my software career after College, only 24.

15:48:15
<transcript>: to b

15:48:22
nft_scam: !git

15:48:24
the_true_jinx: Did that payoff? I have a high paying job but I wanted more freedom (without too much of a pay drop)

15:48:24
<transcript>: To B 24 again. I was living at my parents. 22. I had no idea what I was doing. Life like literally no idea.

15:48:24
<transcript>: i

15:48:30
<transcript>: I had studied some computer science in College, but I dropped out. I failed out because I was addicted to video games.

15:48:34
<transcript>: So there's my history. And then at 22, I got married.

15:48:34
<transcript>: and

15:48:43
<transcript>: And the day I got back from my honeymoon, I started my first fulltime job as a software developer, freelance for someone in Florida that found me.

15:48:43
<transcript>: he was a free

15:48:46
jd4codes: @adamdotdev - Hey, I'm here to see this "air of arrogance" lol

15:48:46
nft_scam: married at 22? damn

15:48:50
tonyboy713: I am still looking for my first job. Graduated back in dec 2021

15:48:51
privann: Great is getting better and better. Sweden is quite microsoft dominant is my opinion, so a lot of C# still. But it's getting bigger and bigger, more and more developers say they use it @oskrM

15:48:51
<transcript>: He was a freelance developer. And, yeah, I've been doing it ever since. So literally, my marriage and my career started the same day.

15:48:51
<transcript>: back in

15:48:53
<transcript>: Back in 2009.

15:49:02
astrojules: honeymoon -> work smolLUL

15:49:05
<transcript>: Trailer. You would work for me. Well, hey, jobs@statmes.com, if you'll not apply. I don't know if I saw panel person bot. Thank you so much for the follow. I don't know if you're a person though.

15:49:09
<transcript>: Because your name says bot, and I'm suspicious.

15:49:09
<transcript>: or

15:49:14
<transcript>: Or in the words of among US players, I'm a little subtle Panda.

15:49:14
<transcript>: a little sass

15:49:16
<transcript>: A little sass.

15:49:16
tnkhanh: wow 2009, happy marriage!

15:49:22
nikolaxhristov: sussy panda

15:49:22
<transcript>: Tan Tony Boy, thank you for the follow. I started business so that I could move to the Netherlands. But it's not a startup.

15:49:25
<transcript>: Yeah. That's the other thing. You can start a small business.

15:49:28
<transcript>: I don't like that term small business.

15:49:39
<transcript>: Sounds so demeaning, but like a business that's not trying to, like, grow really fast, like a startup. I think startup implies, like, you're trying to find a really like blow it out.

15:49:49
jd4codes: I was married in 2008.

15:49:59
<transcript>: No. One day I'll make a startup, but I'm focus on learning good software engineering. First, I've got ten years as real estate broker on my belt. Only three years is a dev. Yeah. I think like working to big companies. Probably the best path to learn how to be a good software engineer. I think you learn a lot of other things at a startup that are not just like being a good, soft.

15:49:59
<transcript>: software engineer

15:50:07
<transcript>: Software engineer. It's like they're valuable skills in the life. How to like scrap stuff together and make things work.

15:50:07
<transcript>: and just like

15:50:25
<transcript>: And just like how to work with people in a very chaotic environment. Those are all valuable skills. But it's not like pure learning how to be a good software engineer. I think the best path to that's probably working at an established company where there's really smart people like you imagine doing working for one of the big tech companies. You've got some of the smartest engineers in the world that you're learning from there.

15:50:28
<transcript>: I think there's a lot of value there.

15:50:44
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat couch. Saw your Spice take on Rails last week after dhhs infrared tweets someone saw my Spice she tweet what your actual thoughts on Rails these days? Rails was great. I didn't mean to like throw shade on Rails so much as.

15:50:44
<transcript>: dh

15:50:48
oskrm: @privann Are corporates moving to Go? Or is it still have to catch up?

15:50:49
<transcript>: Dh is like stuck in 2010 mind.

15:50:49
<transcript>: i just

15:50:52
aj_stuyvenberg: goes without saying but the most important thing is progress. Better to have 10 years of learning than doing the same year 10 times.

15:51:09
<transcript>: I just that guy bothers me so much. Rails is actually fantastic. I have no problems with Rails. I do think it kind of represents the last generation of building apps the previous generation where it's like you can't really build Rails apps without it being a very big monolith thing. And there's nothing wrong with monoliths. But like the deployment.

15:51:09
<transcript>: infrastructure

15:51:25
<transcript>: Infrastructure picture for brailles is very like constrained. There's only so many ways you can deploy a rails app and it basically comes down to running in our container or some kind of vm, and you can't really break it apart into smaller pieces that you can scale independently and all that stuff.

15:51:29
mattmancodes: Rails is great, DHH is (and always has been) a douche

15:51:34
<transcript>: So if your dhh and you build everything in rails or whatever, then sure, why not? Mersque, why not find a way to make it.

15:51:34
<transcript>: deploy on

15:51:42
okufa_f: microservices baby

15:51:48
<transcript>: Deploy on the bare metal easier. I guess it's just like that's how we've been building ass for 15 years and to accept that that's still the way we should be doing it. It's to say that like we've made no progress and I think we have. But I'm a big serverless shill. So what do I know.

15:51:55
privann: @oskrM Corporates are moving to GO more and more, which is cool. They probably see the good stuffs in using GO for corporate stuffs :D

15:51:55
liquidor: DHH?

15:52:01
<transcript>: Thank you so much for joining Chat, though. Couch. I started in huge global corporations and moved to a small midsize company. And now I'm doing startup for the last eight years or something. Yeah. So you've got a good exposure to the different.

15:52:05
<transcript>: Views of software development and company sizes.

15:52:14
<transcript>: Prevail EF Integra is fun. I like it. We mostly write go. Did you do the famous java when you did do JavaScript? So market access is a JavaScript.

15:52:16
astrojules: You have a very solid mindset about your career and tech advice tbh I appreciate it smolCool

15:52:16
oskrm: @privann That's nice :D

15:52:26
<transcript>: Yeah. Do you? I'm wondering. Prevan the fixed protocol. Still a thing like, do you write anything in, like the fixed protocols? That's just the main thing I remember about doing fintech work.

15:52:26
<transcript>: was

15:52:29
<transcript>: Was there's like a xml specification.

15:52:29
<transcript>: called fix

15:52:30
<transcript>: Called fix.

15:52:34
tnkhanh: how long till a company stops being a startup?

15:52:35
<transcript>: Next all. What is Sam use valued at right now? Honestly, I don't know.

15:52:35
<transcript>: because we

15:52:55
privann: noooo @adamdotdev i would probably quit my job if I wrote XML

15:52:56
<transcript>: Because we raised the B, but the B was kind of drawn out. So our Series A, we were valued at 35 million post money, I think. Yeah, post money. We raised ten millions. It was 25 pre 35 post. I think the B was, like, stretched out over, like, a year and a half. And I don't honestly know it's. We did, like, another 404. Nine a.

15:52:56
<transcript>: valuation or

15:53:00
<transcript>: Valuation or whatever. It's part of me. I'm sure we did. I just don't even know.

15:53:00
<transcript>: what

15:53:03
<transcript>: What our car evaluation would be. I'm assuming.

15:53:03
<transcript>: at or above

15:53:05
<transcript>: At or above 35 million.

15:53:05
<transcript>: i don't

15:53:06
tnkhanh: 35 million? wow

15:53:12
<transcript>: I don't think we've ever done a down round. I would have heard about that because that just kind of like smokes your equity percent, your.

15:53:12
<transcript>: stake in the

15:53:15
<transcript>: Stake in the company just destroys it.

15:53:21
<transcript>: Dml. How are you getting the sports data? That's kind of a long story, but.

15:53:26
nexxeln: 35 is a lot for a series A right?

15:53:30
<transcript>: We hired a guy named Justin Kabacco, who's kind of like one of the world's leading sports statisticians. And we licenses data in perpetuity.

15:53:32
nexxeln: thats so cool

15:53:47
<transcript>: He's somebody who had a really great database and then spent like a decade digitizing old newspapers and media guides from teams. So he's got like maybe the most comprehensive sports database across the North American sport in the world. He's a creator of Basketball reference.

15:53:47
<transcript>: and

15:53:49
dnbull: nice!

15:53:50
<transcript>: And that's our data. That's how that works.

15:53:52
gerellt: What a boss

15:53:53
<transcript>: And.

15:54:04
<transcript>: Did that pay off. I have a high paying job, but I wanted more freedom without too much of a pay drop. I don't remember. I'm so far behind now. I don't remember what.

15:54:12
<transcript>: That quite maybe you're talking to some else even did what payoff. I wonder what you're asking.

15:54:17
<transcript>: Jd for code. Welcome to Chat. I know you from Twitter. Hey, I'm here to see this Arab area.

15:54:23
privann: @adamdotdev there is a general thing on how to build integrations doe, but no FIX things. Everything is JSON. we mostly work against https://www.berlin-group.org/nextgenpsd2-downloads which is the standard

15:54:31
<transcript>: Yeah. It's the thing. My wife had to come in again today. She went to get something on the printer. I'm gonna move the printer. So I don't feel like a dork when she comes in every time. Married at 22. Yeah. I got married really young. My wife was 20.

15:54:31
<transcript>: she was twenty

15:54:41
<transcript>: She was 20 when we got married. We talked about it like we lucked out because we realized now now that we know each other really well that we didn't know each other at all before we got married.

15:54:41
<transcript>: we really

15:54:54
<transcript>: We really knew nothing about each other. We I think we did it for, like three months. And we got married at 20 and 22. And we lucked out because we like each other even more than we did when we dated. If you can believe that. And we really got lucky.

15:54:54
<transcript>: i'm sure

15:54:55
tnkhanh: LUL

15:55:01
okufa_f: marrying at 22-20 in this generation is insane

15:55:02
<transcript>: I'm sure it goes the other way sometimes like you think you know some of somebody and then you find out you don't really like them as much as you did. That would suck.

15:55:06
<transcript>: Still looking for my first job graduate back in December of 2021.

15:55:06
<transcript>: two years ago

15:55:08
nexxeln: married after 3 months of dating?

15:55:08
the_true_jinx: did starting your startup payoff? I feel like the media glorifies opening a company.

15:55:08
<transcript>: Two years ago, a couple years ago.

15:55:08
<transcript>: a year and a half ago

15:55:10
nexxeln: damn

15:55:10
<transcript>: A year and a half ago.

15:55:12
tnkhanh: so you didnt know each other when you get married LUL

15:55:13
okufa_f: @nexxeln really depends but sure

15:55:17
<transcript>: Yeah. What's it. I hear it's tough out there right now. I hear it's not the best market for the developers looking for jobs.

15:55:19
<transcript>: Hope that gets better.

15:55:24
<transcript>: Is getting better and better. Sweden is quite Mark. So you guys are talking.

15:55:24
<transcript>: you guys are talking

15:55:26
<transcript>: You guys are talking.

15:55:26
<transcript>: honeymoons

15:55:28
<transcript>: Honeymoons. Straight into work.

15:55:28
jd4codes: I know that feeling.  My wife and been married 15 years and we like each other more today....

15:55:41
<transcript>: Wow. I am so far behind. That was a long time ago. I talked about that's getting married in 2009 and I'm just now reading comments so I need to catch up gonna skip ahead and do it to do JD four. You're married in 2008.

15:55:41
<transcript>: i was very

15:55:46
gerellt: Welcome to the future.

15:55:52
<transcript>: I was very close to win. So we both been married about same that time. What is it? 14 years for me? Coming up on 15 for you. Did I guess I right. Oh, Jeez.

15:55:52

15:56:01
livemahs: i've been passively looking for a while, just suck at leetcode or else I'd be applying for bigger companies

15:56:10
<transcript>: That thing. But the most important thing is progress. Better to have tenure of learning than doing the same year ten times ooh, that's good advice. 1%. Better every day, right.

15:56:11
tnkhanh: how old are your kids?

15:56:12

15:56:41
<transcript>: You have a very odh is like David Neheimer Hoffenheimer or whatever his name is. A very solid mindset about your career and tech advice to watch. I appreciate it. Hey, thanks Astro.

15:56:41
<transcript>: assuming you

15:56:44
<transcript>: Assuming you were talking to me, you could have been talking to someone else in chat.

15:56:44
<transcript>: how long

15:56:48
<transcript>: How long till a company stops being a startup? Great question.

15:56:48
<transcript>: t and k i'm

15:56:50
<transcript>: T and K, I'm gonna answer this.

15:56:59
<transcript>: I have no grounds for having a good answer to this, but I'm gonna answer it. I would say either you get acquired or you IPO.

15:57:08
<transcript>: In which case, you're no longer a startup. If you get acquired, you just don't exist anymore. You've been absorbed into some mothership.

15:57:08
<transcript>: if you

15:57:13
<transcript>: If you IPO, I think you're no longer a startup. You're an established company. You went public.

15:57:13
<transcript>: if you do

15:57:20
<transcript>: If you do neither of those things, I think you're still a startup until you die. That's my. That's my take if you were to live on.

15:57:20
<transcript>: like

15:57:22
<transcript>: Like for.

15:57:22
<transcript>: decades

15:57:23
<transcript>: Decades.

15:57:23
<transcript>: without doing either

15:57:30
<transcript>: Without doing either of those two things, then you might just be a small business. I don't know. Is that what small businesses are? I don't.

15:57:30
<transcript>: stop

15:57:30
<transcript>: Stop.

15:57:37
0xcouch: Does StatMuse maintain their own stat database or just hit an external API and use a cache?

15:57:47
<transcript>: 35 is a lot for susa. Yes. Next, it was too high and that I talked about it yesterday on Stream. That was like the reason we didn't get acquired a couple times when we were really close to getting acquired, because we were just kind of value trapped. We got valued really high, really early. There's a lot of excitement.

15:57:47
<transcript>: early on

15:57:51
<transcript>: Early on in our stat muse history still is but.

15:57:51
<transcript>: it was

15:57:55
<transcript>: It was intense at the very beginning, kind of had a competitive a round.

15:57:55
<transcript>: praband

15:58:00
tnkhanh: pog

15:58:06
tnkhanh: are you waiting for a quiet?

15:58:12
<transcript>: Praband, there is a general thing on how to build integrations doe, but no fixed things. Everything is json. Oh nice. The finance industry has moved on from xml. We mostly work against Berlin Group, whatever that is, which is a standard. Okay, interesting.

15:58:22
<transcript>: Mirroring at 22 and 20 in this generation is insane. Well, am I in this generation? What generation am I a millennial. So.

15:58:22
<transcript>: i mean

15:58:24
<transcript>: I mean, that's been 13 years ago.

15:58:31
<transcript>: Does that still is that still insane? Acufa. It probably is. You know, none of my friends really got married that early. We got married really early.

15:58:38
<transcript>: Thank you. I feel like the Media glorified opening a company.

15:58:38
<transcript>: our

15:58:40
<transcript>: Ours paid off.

15:58:40
<transcript>: so we

15:58:42
<transcript>: So we started that music.

15:58:53
<transcript>: My cofounder and I eli. We had both had pretty successful careers. He was in finance. I was in Tech. We've done really well our first five years after College, whatever it was. Five, six years.

15:58:53
<transcript>: so we

15:58:56
gerellt: Was this your only startup? Or did you fail any before?

15:59:02
<transcript>: So we had some money saved up and it was pretty low risk for us at that stage to, like, take a leap and try and start something that might pay off really big.

15:59:04
<transcript>: And.

15:59:04
<transcript>: yeah

15:59:10
<transcript>: Yeah, we paid off for us. I think we got lucky, though. Like, I know a lot of people start startups, and they don't go.

15:59:10
<transcript>: great

15:59:18
okufa_f: @0xCOUCH sportsdata/sportradar are leading sports stats providers in this industry. i believe he said yesterday that statmuse is using sportradar

15:59:22
<transcript>: Great. Like they don't have a great first experience or second experience. I think a lot of it. We just got lucky. I think right place, right time. We executed on an idea that resonated with a bunch of people.

15:59:25
<transcript>: And yeah, it paid off. I mean.

15:59:25
<transcript>: like

15:59:28
<transcript>: Like we're still going eight years in.

15:59:28
<transcript>: we made a

15:59:34
okufa_f: from my experience, sportradar is a bit better than sportdata io

15:59:37
<transcript>: We made a dent in the sports landscape, at least sports media like we kind of established sat muses, kind of on the map there. I've had some financial.

15:59:46
<transcript>: Like I sold a bunch of my steak in statmes, so I finally kind of got to realize some of the value we had created.

15:59:48
<transcript>: Yeah. What else.

15:59:48
<transcript>: we got

15:59:56
<transcript>: We got to do a lot of fun things. We got to, like, hang out with some pretty cool people, athletes and stuff.

15:59:56
<transcript>: at games

15:59:59
<transcript>: At Games. Do some really neat experiences of sports fans.

15:59:59
<transcript>: that otherwise

16:00:00
okufa_f: statmuse presence on twitter is huge

16:00:02
<transcript>: That otherwise would definitely not have.

16:00:02
<transcript>: never

16:00:06
<transcript>: Never done those things out of starting stamus.

16:00:06
<transcript>: i'm just

16:00:10
<transcript>: I'm just. I'm a nerd. I'm a tech nerd. So anyway, yeah, it was. It paid off.

16:00:15
binajmen: a little bit like Jim from The Office ;D

16:00:20
<transcript>: I didn't know each other when you got married. We knew each other. We just didn't know each other as well as we know each other now and now it feels like we hardly knew each other.

16:00:30
<transcript>: My wife has been my wife and I have been married 15 years. We'd like each other more today. Yeah. Same jd Four. It's a good feeling you feel like you kind of hit the lottery.

16:00:34
oleksii_lisovyi: Hey yo Adam!

16:00:38
<transcript>: Okay, welcome to the future. I'm so behind I'm not catching up, you guys, you keep talking, and I keep getting more behind.

16:00:50
<transcript>: I've been passively looking for a while. Just stuck it suck at leak code, or else I'd be applying for beer companies. How old are your kids? I've got a eight year old just turned eight and three year old. Both boys.

16:01:02
<transcript>: Met my wife in 94 and married her in 2006 years. So that's probably more normal. It's like actually get to know somebody over a period of time. I will say I didn't just meet my wife so I should go back.

16:01:02
<transcript>: we dated

16:01:06
<transcript>: We dated for three months. We knew each other since.

16:01:10
<transcript>: I mean, for a decade, I'm like we grew up in the same high school.

16:01:10
<transcript>: so

16:01:15
<transcript>: So she was two years younger than me and my little brother's class. They were really close.

16:01:21
okufa_f: ohh, yeah tha tmakes sense

16:01:24
<transcript>: So we knew each other. We hung out in like friend contexts for, you know, quite a bit before we started dating.

16:01:24
<transcript>: okay

16:01:31
<transcript>: Okay, the samus maintained their own sad database or just hit an external API and use a cache. It is our onstet database.

16:01:31
<transcript>: and

16:01:37
<transcript>: And it's I've kind of talked about it a few times now, but we have a sports statistician. We hired.

16:01:37
<transcript>: that

16:01:38
<transcript>: That.

16:01:38
<transcript>: built our data

16:01:40
<transcript>: Built our database.

16:01:40
<transcript>: we

16:01:42
tnkhanh: Adam's love stories stream Kreygasm

16:01:45
<transcript>: We get we do have external api's for live data for new sports data.

16:01:45
<transcript>: but yeah

16:01:48
<transcript>: But, yeah, we have our own internal database.

16:01:48
<transcript>: okay

16:01:50
<transcript>: Okay. Are you waiting for a quiet.

16:01:50
<transcript>: what's a quiet

16:01:52
<transcript>: What's a quiet.

16:01:58
<transcript>: Was this your only startup? Yes. That is my only startup. I mean, I've done like, side projects.

16:01:58
<transcript>: i will say

16:02:11
<transcript>: I will say I've created a few delaware C corpse because I get very ambitious with my side projects, but it's the only startup where I've actually tried to fundraise actually done the startup thing. Hired people, all that.

16:02:26
<transcript>: Sports Data are leading sports stats providers in this industry. I believe you said yesterday. Stat Museum Sport radar. Yeah, we were it's been a while since I've looked. I'm almost caught up. I have looked at our realtime sports data feeds in a while, so it's very possible.

16:02:26
<transcript>: that it's

16:02:31
<transcript>: That it's different now, but we use Fort radar, at least for the first handful of years.

16:02:35
<transcript>: Okay. It's 10:00. I would do have to go here shortly.

16:02:35
<transcript>: for my experience

16:02:55
<transcript>: For my experience, four raider is a big, better than sport. Data sat me's presence on twitter's. Huge. Yeah, we do really well in social. I said yesterday, people really like sports, and that's one advice I have for people if you're like what I want to build, like I want to do a startup, but I don't know what to build. Find niches or topics that people are really passionate about. You. Like, get yourself.

16:02:55
<transcript>: between

16:03:07
liquidor: I love building sites with data for a hobby or prof.

16:03:11
<transcript>: Between sports fans and the thing they love, and they're gonna be very passionate about your thing. So that's something that paid off for us. We built for sports fans. Turns out sports are very, like central to a lot of people's identities. And that made for a very passive, early group of users.

16:03:11
<transcript>: okay

16:03:12
<transcript>: Okay.

16:03:12
<transcript>: a little bit like

16:03:13
<transcript>: A little bit like.

16:03:13
<transcript>: jim from

16:03:15
<transcript>: Jim from the office.

16:03:15
<transcript>: who's a little bit

16:03:17
<transcript>: Who's a little bit like Jim from the office.

16:03:25
<transcript>: Hey, Alesky. Alexis. Here. Hey. Oh, that makes sense.

16:03:25
<transcript>: adams love

16:03:27
<transcript>: Adams Love Stories Stream Yeah, I did.

16:03:27
<transcript>: i kind of told

16:03:30
okufa_f: the illustrations help significantly with the social presence

16:03:37
<transcript>: I kind of told a lot of stories about my wife today. Talked about stat muse. I love building sites with data for a hobby or professional or proof.

16:03:37
<transcript>: the illustrations

16:03:40
<transcript>: The illustrations helped me. Yeah, yeah. Oh. So our illustrations.

16:03:41
okufa_f: very unique to statmuse

16:03:47
oleksii_lisovyi: Haven't seen you for a while streaming. Are you OK this days?

16:03:51
<transcript>: A guy named Michael walshk as well. Has worked at stmes for like, eight years, literally, since, like, the first year. And he just illustrates players every single day. That's what he does. Boogie bugs. Thank you for the follow.

16:03:54
liquidor: profession :P sorry

16:04:12
<transcript>: That story behind that is eli. And I we talked with all the people, like, Getty about licensing player profile photos. And it was just like it's a ton of money. And they're so restrictive about how you can use them. And you only get certain sizes of them. And it's like we just felt like we're gonna look like every other site. And we're gonna buy these licensed images.

16:04:12
<transcript>: we

16:04:27
oskrm: the illustration are really cool

16:04:32
<transcript>: We have some funding, but like, it's just gonna be vanilla. And we thought, what if we found a couple of artists? We talked to a few of them, including Michael Waltzock, that we like their style. And they were already drawing a lot of mba players on the Twitter and stuff Instagram. And we thought, hey, wouldn't it be cool if we just hired somebody and just made every player, like.

16:04:32
<transcript>: we just

16:04:52
<transcript>: We just illustrated every player, and we did a ton over the years for the NBA. And then we as we added Sports, while Talk has had to work on all these other sports and make all these other illustrations, he's got it down to a science, though. We need to get him to do, like, a little, like a stream where he makes them on Twitter or something. I haven't come on our stream. That would be so cool, actually.

16:04:52
<transcript>: i just

16:04:55
<transcript>: I just had an idea in the middle of that thought.

16:04:55
<transcript>: and i think it

16:05:00
<transcript>: And I think it's gonna be great. We're gonna have Wall Chuck. Come on. He's gonna do an illustration on Stream. That'll be fun.

16:05:02
okufa_f: that would be a good stream

16:05:05
oskrm: now you can't go back!

16:05:07
<transcript>: Carfino and wifeert. Wifert. Thank you so much for the follows.

So I had literally like my first baby and my first startup at the same time. And they're both babies. And we were having to take care of both of them and travel a lot. My son aysa has been all over the country because we flew. I'm just fundraising and all these other things we did.
