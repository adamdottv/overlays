02:08:15
<transcript>: But now you're thinking of returning the heart.

02:08:24
<transcript>: I'm going to go over what you do, what change and the best way to get back into playing Arsenal. Starting with.

02:08:27
<transcript>: This seven years.

02:08:34

02:09:11
<transcript>: Watch my videos on those four of more in depth.

02:09:17
<transcript>: Yeah. The scheme doesn't add a lot of new things Besides the card. So let's get into the best way to.

02:09:26
<transcript>: Start to get the best start for returning after a first. If you haven't logged in for 120 days, you'll be rewarded for your abstinence.

02:09:32
<transcript>: Series and a pretty decent plan. Being honest, I recommend looking up.

02:09:40
<transcript>: Sure you can choose the best deck out of all of them. But if I are you, I choose the fact that you.

02:09:44
<transcript>: Enjoy plenty of notes.

02:09:53
<transcript>: So though the cards change the class lifestyle generally since you've been away with a good chance.

02:10:13
<transcript>: As a preview.

02:10:20
<transcript>: If you want to adjust yourself.

02:10:25
<transcript>: I'd recommend that with the legendary you get.

02:10:36
<transcript>: Around that legendary it'll be a good way to learn meta and try to slot that before branding Ladder. Maybe you don't want to waste your time in game.
