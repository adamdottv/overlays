00:24:18
xerinox: Did you just assume my level of agression!?😡

00:24:40
devagrawal099: OMG ADAM IS STREAMING

00:24:44
trivenge: i decided to get a low profile mechanical keyboard. dax convinced me

00:24:49
ae517: Feeling better I presume?

00:24:50
trivenge: so now im experimenting when it comes in NotLikeThis

00:24:51
mehulsharmamat: okay adam now that i am more of a business man (i have a moustache and half a suit) i wanna know what does statmuse do and how much can you tell me about the sports market? I'm borderling making a prototype with something something blah blah wanna make something for indian sports market.

00:25:24
mehulsharmamat: how much can you tell me about working* in the sports market

00:25:44
xerinox: missing open { ? right?

00:26:04
rollie042: You had just a semicolon on line 25

00:26:05
trivenge: when i was younger, this is how dumb i was as a kid, i legit thought that india had a competitive crocheting sport. like legit, i used to think as a kid that india had a sport where people, mainly old ladies, would compete in some crocheting task LUL

00:26:17
trivenge: fake noises LUL

00:26:18
rollie042: oh that's normal?

00:26:20
trivenge: haha

00:26:26
mightycore1: !keyboard

00:26:26
fossabot: Adam uses a custom Mode Eighty mechanical keyboard, and has a collection of other Mode keyboards!

00:26:34
mehulsharmamat: @triveNge LMAOOO

00:27:19
ae517: Adam is feeling awful, fire the alerts 'cause this is troublesome.

00:27:50
mehulsharmamat: adam ignored my questions because board members shouted at him through the internets

00:28:36
pbertrand_dev: can't believe he just leaked that key, wont that risk his production data

00:28:40
ae517: What flavor of nVim is this? Lazy?

00:28:49
trivenge: i think its dax edition?

00:29:05
arkansassnowman: the semiannual adamdotdev stream! jk glad to see you on this morning.

00:29:38
mehulsharmamat: d2c yes and india is VERY much into sports and what im doing has been done before just not very good-ly. but yeah indians pay rarely so monetization is hard but there's billions of us so nice i guess

00:29:57
mehulsharmamat: @triveNge his ghost still haunts us

00:29:57
arkansassnowman: is this statmuse?

00:30:02
xerinox: India has kabaddi, it's a cool sport

00:30:44
mehulsharmamat: @xerinox very very cool very under talked about  it's like rugby but minus the unnecessary balls and running around

00:31:29
mehulsharmamat: nah

00:32:22
mehulsharmamat: more like sports community + find players around for the MVP  search Playo / Hudle. that but with better unit economics better goals better biz plan and 100x GTM

00:33:01
baffledalways: i'm more of an improv than on demand jokes kinda guy

00:33:02
jenswoeste: OMG its Adam!?

tymekdev: Long time no see!

00:33:44
xerinox: Debugging: Removing the needles from the haystack.

00:34:01
mehulsharmamat: they are in good market but they're doing it the wrong way and UX is bad + theres 9 apps now doing the same thing they're circlejerking to be better than each other but not really offering good UX or solving problems

00:34:08
arkansassnowman: is your setup up to date in the description?

00:34:20
mehulsharmamat: my city (jaipur) has population of 6M+ and ZERO people constantly playing I CAN NOT BELIEVE

00:34:44
mehulsharmamat: i grew up playing cricket / football so much people play sports here a lot but yeah basically there needs to be someone reviving it

00:34:45
arkansassnowman: down further under the How

00:34:48
mehulsharmamat: could fail but who knows

00:34:54

00:35:42
tymekdev: What chair?

00:35:56
trivenge: !chair

00:36:08
mehulsharmamat: zero people organizing matches etc on apps, people are playing locally etc but not logged online basically and india already gets so much food delivered online this HAS to be a thing (is my bet)

00:36:20
mehulsharmamat: anyway enough stupid talk let's go back to roasting dax

00:36:28
l_mbert: Sounds great! Building stream incoming?

00:36:47

nunescoded: long time no see

00:40:03
tumtumpkinz: heard you are slandering the good name of golang today, shame

00:40:12
trivenge: @mehulsharmamat dax is great, one time i asked dax for a pen, and he said, "buy your own pens, nerd!" and dax proceeded to dunk my head into a toilet. true story

00:40:15
mehulsharmamat: man adam is like the opposite of dax can't possibly be mean to you, on the other than the dax guy

00:40:44
oetziofficial: I cant use ion yet too. I have 4 projects using SST. I could move 2 of them to ion as soon as I can

00:40:54
mehulsharmamat: @triveNge he once told me to quit trying because it's worthless, love that guy

00:40:58
trivenge: stackmuse and SST fusion

00:41:04
trivenge: dragonball z as adults

00:41:05
trivenge: all over again

00:41:14
trivenge: we love that guy @mehulsharmamat

00:41:36
mehulsharmamat: we obviously do, his haircare tips are the best

00:42:58
oetziofficial: so many lines of code wow

00:43:05
mehulsharmamat: i usually just change the extension to .js at this point

00:43:07
trivenge: adam, if you shaved off your beard, would your second half disapprove of this decision?

00:43:21
baffledalways: Oh Ozarks, does the show get the vibe of the area right (besides the crime focus 😅)

00:43:38
oetziofficial: smart shuffle adds new music into the queue (if its not in the playlist)

00:44:04
baffledalways: :o

00:44:06
mehulsharmamat: I just heard "we have a ton of meth"

00:44:09
mehulsharmamat: brb clipping

00:44:10
adjectiveallison: good morning adam it's wonderful to see you streaming

00:44:13
oetziofficial: Wow, the Ozarks sound welcoming

00:44:29
trivenge: paper plate LUL

00:44:30
arkansassnowman: lol

00:44:59
arkansassnowman: oh hey i forgot to mention i changed my username - my old name was sj_se in chat before. We did a discord call as well

00:45:04
mehulsharmamat: https://clips.twitch.tv/ChillyEphemeralPicklesPicoMause-pEFcqcDvLraTiLTH

00:45:09
trivenge: lol

00:45:11
baffledalways: haha I get what you mean because of Fargo

00:45:26
baffledalways: minnesota nice

00:46:04
trivenge: people live in minnesota?

00:46:26
adjectiveallison: The ? makes it undefined possible that's the reason it's erroring

00:46:39
adjectiveallison: Wait never mind you're good

00:47:58
arkansassnowman: still trucking on my idea I showed you (its still a secret). trying to find a good patent attorney right now. no luck so far.

00:48:06
mehulsharmamat: I recently had people getting 200 generated images (they should get 30) because I was saving ids like 2938190 as strings so "2938190" and then checking if they existed AFTER parseInt  yeah i hate js

00:49:41
ae517: @mehulsharmamat O.o

00:51:07
aaoa_: Aight imma be out on a 8h Nap potpot3Nap  have fun with the TypeScript errors aaoaShinyA brando83Sparkle

00:51:17
peculiarnewbie: playing RTJ is an instant follow

00:51:19
aaoa_: Yup

00:51:24
aaoa_: is is just that

00:52:25
restarted: if no teamleaders it will be FFF and 000

00:53:16
bronifty: do you use EventBridge

00:53:30
ae517: Isn't it design unwise to use pure white (FFF) and pure black (000)?

00:54:24
mehulsharmamat: ok adam i will also code like a big boy now and not just roam around on twitch

00:54:30
restarted: no your code had "?? 'FFF'" and "?? '000'" at the end of the lines.

00:54:58
ae517: Oooh, The Less I Know the Better. Vibes. ^ ~ ^

00:55:33
schrew: hello streamer BJJ code man

00:56:01
alexkates: are we bak?

00:56:52
tymekdev: It might not pick up that the array has to have at least 1 element

00:57:25
tymekdev: Yeah, but it thinks it might map over an empty array

00:57:32
oetziofficial: I think its the terniary `? : ` stuff

00:57:48
ae517: Wouldn't some regex help?

00:58:06
ae517: Wait I didn't think that beforehand.

00:59:38
oetziofficial: can you show the PlayerCardComponent thing again? do you pass the card prop?

01:00:01
oetziofficial: within the previous file you worked on

01:01:51
oetziofficial: what is the team leaders?

01:02:51
bronifty: you are my team lead i will send you all the work j/k

01:02:53
oetziofficial: there is one PlayerCardcomponent where you are passing teamLeaders as card prop

01:03:30
neochromer: an adam stream

01:03:31
neochromer: what is this

01:03:32
neochromer: 2021?

01:03:42
mightycore1: case sensitive search?

01:04:20
oetziofficial: Ohhh the teamLeaders is an array and the array obv does not have all these properties

01:04:26
ae517: Just curiosity. I'm not familiar with Astro, what more ya using alongside? I see Svelte as well.

01:04:28
darrenbaldwin03: Dang is statmuse all static? Didnt know you built it in Astro

01:04:49
oetziofficial: Do you use the right Component? 😂

01:05:05
oetziofficial: I dont think its fixed

01:06:19
oetziofficial: wait how does it work now lol

01:06:49
bronifty: T.I.T.S.

01:07:55
ae517: No Back then? Or there is one?

01:08:44
bronifty: time in the saddle

01:09:23
oetziofficial: is statmuse open source?

01:10:00
adamdotdev: github.com/statmuse/statmuse.com

01:10:07
ae517: Ooh, the front is open, so there's a back.

01:10:41
oetziofficial: oh, I just wanted to see the context of these error we had, so we dont fall into the same issues again XD

01:11:19
ae517: I was Just curious about what stack the project use.

01:13:03
ae517: Wait, stack information can be classified if it is closed-source?

01:13:49
oetziofficial: can you rerun it?

01:15:02
ae517: Aah I see.

01:15:21
dnbull: hihi @adamdotdev

01:15:34
dnbull: aye you remember LUL

01:15:36
dnbull: <3

01:15:40
bronifty: state machine seems like a good saga

01:15:51
oetziofficial: so far I like the code base, now I can follow along :)

01:16:05
oetziofficial: huh

01:16:24
dnbull: How's statmuse going

01:16:29
bronifty: coordinate multiple processes = saga (long running like order process)

01:16:33
oetziofficial: I wont tell you if the codebase sucks, thats not how I work KEKW

01:17:34
nodemon12: ad?

01:18:01
darrenbaldwin03: Whats this seed.run

01:18:04
ae517: Been considering expanding my stack knowledge. Not embrace only JS/TS and Node...

01:18:05
peculiarnewbie: ok i was aware of statmuse before, but since football (okay, soccer) is the only sport i follow, i just now see its magic SeemsGood

01:18:46
darrenbaldwin03: Whats ur role at statmuse?

01:18:51
darrenbaldwin03: ah OK

01:20:22
standardrobot: sup adam

01:20:25

01:21:02
standardrobot: good good wbu

01:21:11
standardrobot: i forgot that you get up at the crack of down to stream

01:21:13
bronifty: test in production

01:21:36
allamgr: How do you censor your windows?

01:21:49
ae517: That's a really nice top bar? Is it Mac?

01:21:50
oetziofficial: what is a Data lake?

01:21:55
itsmeleague: How many simultaneous users do you guys get on average?

01:22:26
prithu__: what do you use for your data lake?

01:22:36
bronifty: the “building microservices” author refers to “observability” -or instrumentation of in order to aggregate/centralize logging - as “testing in production”

01:22:37
ae517: The one you hover at the top of the screen. With the status icons.

01:22:58
bronifty: sorry for that sentence structure

01:23:51
bronifty: he says “observability” is “testing in prod”

01:23:54
itsmeleague: Jesus thats a lot

01:23:59
allamgr: I have used this website a lot.

01:24:10
prithu__: How are guys finding athena's performance

01:24:22
attentioncore: what happened to your voice?

01:24:39
bronifty: i am learning “observability” now. it is described as “instrumentation” of logs

01:25:19
ae517: I thought your voice was naturally like that. *Proceeds to go to YouTube just to check* You got a sub btw.

01:25:22
bronifty: “instrumentation” is described as centralizing -aka aggregation- of logs

01:25:49
popo_______: hey hey!

01:26:04
prithu__: how hard can it be

01:26:05
bronifty: ez

01:27:17
ae517: Ooh, it's smooth. What happened? Cold?

01:27:42
allamgr: you removed { haha

01:28:23
sudo_says: it's good to see you again

01:28:29
oetziofficial: @allamgr you add the source in OBS with a filter (scale) and setup the scale filtering to: point and then set your resolution to 10x smaller than your default resolution. and then on OBS Canvas you can increase the new source

01:28:33
ae517: *Proceeds to inflate ego*. I'm not saying ya wrong tho.

01:28:48
itsmeleague: Weird guy that dax guy

01:28:58
oetziofficial: but I am not sure if its correct

01:29:30
bronifty: cloud formation? more like cloud cant formation amirite

01:29:33
oetziofficial: I will do some small workout today

01:29:43
peculiarnewbie: so sst ion will make the stream less interactive, gotcha

01:29:56
oetziofficial: will do

01:30:26
lowlevellearning: AYO

01:30:28
oetziofficial: what I dont understand why Postgres on AWS is so expensive

01:30:45
lowlevellearning: chillin man hyd

01:30:55
fetchreq: sick Adam is better than no Adam

01:30:59
prithu__: thoughts on CDK for terraform?

01:31:40
ae517: I've been longing to try Svelte, but I can't leave Vue. I really need to expand my stack knowledge. -_- Maybe I'll try Elixir and go full Functional Wizardry.

01:32:21
oetziofficial: first time I used PG on AWS I was scared after 5 days, every day 1$ went to it. now I use turso (free) but its not perfect either... the socket times out several times

01:33:09
oetziofficial: the AWS console WutFace

01:33:39
ae517: I really like FP, it's almost like I'm writing equations. But I can't use Haskell cuz no one will probably embrace such 'fOrBiDdEn MaGicK'.

01:33:51
sudo_says: oh wow i just realised that nfl playoff season must be huge for statmuse

01:33:54
oetziofficial: for dev I would go docker PG

01:36:00
oetziofficial: I dont do staging, 😂

01:36:20
mr_yan19: I work for a telecom / tv provider and the super bowl is the one event we do most of our capacity planning around

01:36:41
ae517: And I don't like Java to use Scala, so it's Elixir or C#, but C# relies to much on EntityFramework and Blazor Pages not necessarily need a Front 'cause is all C#.

01:37:48
ae517: Also Elixir is a BR language, and as a BR it's a win-win situation. XD

01:38:26
oetziofficial: I dont die

01:38:32
dnbull: yes adam, we live to die LUL

01:38:36
oetziofficial: I will continue to live as AI

01:38:44
sudo_says: when you're sick you're just dying a little bit faster

01:39:56
oetziofficial: btw idk if you know this, everytime there is a new podcast episode I listen to it while walking for an hour outside

01:39:57
ae517: If you put in perspective (and ignore spiritual views) no one truly dies, matter cannot be created or destroyed, it only shape and re-shape itself.

01:40:44
neochromer: but what about the mind

01:40:50
neochromer: does my mind survive

01:40:56
neochromer: @adamdotdev btw still using the same keyboard?

01:40:58
algebra97: do u use an ORM for database querying or you use raw sql expressions?

01:40:59
oetziofficial: isnt there a saying: you only die when there is no memory of you left?

01:40:59
neochromer: or did you try a split one ?

01:43:33
ae517: @NeoChromer There's a field philosophical path called Solipsism, it states the your reality is a product of your mind and your mind only. It holds the idea that knowledge of anything outside one's own mind is unsure; the external world and other minds cannot be known and might not exist outside the mind. The worrying thing is that it cannot be proven, nor unproven.

01:44:02
allamgr: It's looks so easy do changes without oop! by the way what do you use for backend? astro?

01:44:02
sudo_says: @OetziOfficial yeah i think a lot of cultures have that as part of their beliefs about death

01:45:14
