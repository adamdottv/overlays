12:26:51
<transcript>: twitter

12:27:00
<transcript>: There's some stuff coming at Reinvent. Oh, my word. Oh, my word. Actually, some of it is coming this week.

12:27:04
<transcript>: Pre invent if you will, that's what we call it in the biz.

12:27:09
<transcript>: But there's a feature announced it reinvent that is going to.

12:27:11
cowfacedude99: discord is still nice.

12:27:17
<transcript>: It. This is sounds like hyperbole. And I get very excited about things. So just take it with a granite salt cow face is here.

12:27:22
<transcript>: It's gonna change how I build applications fundamentally.

12:27:22
<transcript>: okay

12:27:30
<transcript>: Okay. There's a thing coming. It Reinvent, man. I'm excited about it. I'm supposed to get into the Beta here shortly. I guess if I do, I can't show it.

12:27:33
<transcript>: On Twitter. But.

12:27:41
cowfacedude99: but it is not as easy to discover people

12:27:42
<transcript>: Very excited to play with it again. It's gonna change like the way I'm gonna be building it to be your guest today.

12:27:46
<transcript>: I will not be building it that way in a few weeks.

12:27:52
<transcript>: Wow, thanks so much Matt Citrum for the follow.

12:28:01
vim_cerf: did you get any clarification on what you can show on AWS and not? was it just the support chat?

12:28:03
<transcript>: No. I mean for the prime subscription, try and figure out why my notifications aren't working, why I can hear nothing in my headphones.

12:28:10
<transcript>: Did you get any clarification on what you can show on a Tobis and not was it just a support chat.

12:28:10
<transcript>: so

12:28:16
<transcript>: So. Yeah, Vim, I got a message from. Okay, this is bothering me. Thank you for the follow WC.

12:28:16
<transcript>: my

12:28:19
<transcript>: My things are not working.

12:28:21
<transcript>: Why aren't they working.

00:14:54
<transcript>: And WCA W, fataire.

00:14:54
<transcript>: hoping

00:15:01
<transcript>: Hoping I get notifications soon hoping that starts working now maybe we'll see.

00:15:09
<transcript>: Because otherwise, I'm not gonna notice all this whole stream when people are doing things, I'm not gonna hear it or see it or feel it.

00:15:11
<transcript>: Smell it.

00:15:27
<transcript>: Easier to discover people. What was I was talking about? Oh, yeah, Mitch. So Mitch said he just didn't know what to do, and he felt like he shouldn't proceed if he didn't know what to do. But no hard feelings. He was super kind.

00:15:27
<transcript>: and

00:15:40
<transcript>: And even stayed on the stream and listened throughout the stream to kind of get more clarification about the issue he brought in the other fellow. I can't remember the DynamoDB expert that came in and figured out what the issue was.

00:15:44
<transcript>: And mass some support right there. That's what I'll say.

00:16:03
vim_cerf: nice :)

00:16:08
<transcript>: Discord. Yeah. Discord is nice. I feel like I'm still learning discord, which is stupid, but like I learned the other day I had a call with Tiege, actually on discord and didn't know you could have calls on discord. That's how much of a boom or I am, I guess.

00:16:14
<transcript>: So I had a, like, a video call on Discord for the first time. No idea that was possible.

00:16:16
<transcript>: So that's pretty cool.

00:16:22
<transcript>: I'm so bothered right now, but I'm not getting notifications like so bothered.

00:16:22
twitch_ganesh: awguess.com is neat

00:16:25
cowfacedude99: I am learning discord too LUL

00:17:23
yuji_rexion: What was your schedule like when you were taking those AWS cert? The blog doesn't mention it and am just curious.

00:17:26
<transcript>: This. I can't move forward. I can't move on without notifications. So I'm gonna fix that first thing, and then we're gonna work on AW guests. Next we are moving AW. Guess from.

00:17:26
<transcript>: tier

00:17:30
<transcript>: Tierpc to.

00:17:33
<transcript>: My typical AWS stack.

00:17:33
<transcript>: it just i

00:17:43
<transcript>: It just I feel slow. And also I feel like I should build AW guests with AWS stuff. You know, it feels like.

00:17:45
<transcript>: This feels like I should.

00:17:45
<transcript>: it's kind of

00:17:49
yuji_rexion: Also would like to take certifications as well, will try out that acloudguru site, looks promising

00:17:50
nexxeln: that is true

00:17:53
theruggedbear: steam sponsored by Mike Kappa

00:17:59
theruggedbear: stream* :(

00:17:59
<transcript>: It's kind of the whole thing. So I am moving it into the more traditional GraphQL on AWS thing. I do the serverless stuff I typically build with what was your schedule, like when you were taking those AWS certs. The blog doesn't mention it, and I'm curious.

00:17:59
<transcript>: yeah so

00:18:02
<transcript>: Yeah so UG typically.

00:18:05
<transcript>: So there was a lot of weeks. I was doing two certs in a week.

00:18:05
<transcript>: i

00:18:10
<transcript>: I would study for, like two days, take a test, and then take a day off.

00:18:10
<transcript>: so

00:18:19
<transcript>: So generally I would like listen to or watch some course on really high speed for a couple days.

00:18:19
<transcript>: take the

00:18:29
<transcript>: Take the test. And then the next day, I just kind of do nothing. And then the next day to start for the next test. So I just did that basically until I got them all.

00:18:33
<transcript>: I need to change your handle. Twitch. Ganesh.

00:18:33
<transcript>: zoomer

00:18:35

<transcript>: But it's very possible that.

00:19:42
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:19:49
<transcript>: Very possible that I have to hide my screen here shortly. So we're gonna go to.

00:19:54
<transcript>: Code Twitch overload.

00:19:56
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:20:08

<transcript>: And sometime.

00:20:13

00:20:44
<transcript>: Top tokens. This is the one. Okay, I'm gonna go fuzzy.

00:20:48
nexxeln: minioned isn't working either

00:20:48
<transcript>: Screen is fuzzy. We're gonna open this token file.

00:20:54
<transcript>: I guess I'll just remake the Tokens. I just. I'm terrified to do that.

00:20:57
<transcript>: Refresh token.

00:20:57
<transcript>: i wonder if

00:20:59
<transcript>: I wonder if I can see.

00:21:04
<transcript>: How minion isn't working either. So yeah, I'm not getting.

00:21:04
<transcript>: any any

00:21:06
<transcript>: Any any web hooks.

00:21:08
<transcript>: Let me just make sure.

00:21:12
<transcript>: I want to just make sure if I restart ingrock it doesn't start working.

00:21:17
<transcript>: Possibly there is something wrong with ingrock.

00:21:22
<transcript>: Let's try Can somebody minion me again? Or I'll do it hang on.

00:21:22
nexxeln: imma get my database hat too

00:21:26
<transcript>: Did it work.

00:21:30
<transcript>: Anything? No.

00:21:35
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm not. I'm not getting events from the web hook. So.

00:21:39
<transcript>: Get your database. Hat. Next.

00:21:41
richard_keep: we can see your tokens

00:21:43
<transcript>: Let's see if I can just update this token.

00:21:46
<transcript>: Or first I'm gonna go to Twitch, actually.

00:21:49
<transcript>: Twitch.

00:21:54
<transcript>: I guess if you can't see my screen, we can all at least listen to music, right.

00:21:58
<transcript>: Twitter, Twitch.

00:22:05
<transcript>: Let's see it's like devs.

00:22:20
<transcript>: endpoint sub

00:22:22
<transcript>: Endpoint subtant token.

00:22:31
<transcript>: Do I want to create a new secret and just rotate them for sure.

00:22:35
<transcript>: Or can I just actually let me just do this.

00:22:38
<transcript>: If I restart my.

00:22:44
<transcript>: Oh, this is so fuzzy. Now I don't remember how any of this works. I should have documented it. Probably.

00:22:44
<transcript>: you can

00:22:47
<transcript>: You can see my tokens. What.

00:22:53
<transcript>: Tell me you can see your token my you can see my tokens.

<transcript>: No, you can't.

00:22:55
<transcript>: right

00:22:56
<transcript>: Right.

00:22:59

<transcript>: there's

00:23:08
jaystation3x: Minecraft tokens

00:23:08
<transcript>: There's a script when the when the server starts up.

00:23:14
<transcript>: Let's see when the server starts up.

00:23:21
<transcript>: I was in a bad mood over my notifications aren't working and then.

00:23:21
<transcript>: this song

00:23:24
<transcript>: This song this song does it for me every time.

00:23:28
<transcript>: When the server starts up.

00:23:28
<transcript>: i

00:23:29
<transcript>: I.

00:23:32
<transcript>: We create all the web hooks.

00:23:32
<transcript>: yeah

00:23:34
<transcript>: Yeah, let's see.

00:23:34
<transcript>: is in a twitch

00:23:36
<transcript>: Is in a Twitch controller.

00:23:42
<transcript>: Think so.

00:23:42
<transcript>: yeah set

00:23:45
<transcript>: Yeah. Set up Vint sub.

00:23:48
<transcript>: And then you can't see this that's by design.

00:23:53
<transcript>: Let's see, we list subscriptions. I'm just gonna recreate them all.

00:24:12
<transcript>: Okay. Log subscriptions.

00:24:16
<transcript>: This is something dumb. I'm gonna be so upset.

00:24:16
<transcript>: if this was just

00:24:20
<transcript>: If this was just like a dumb thing, I forgot to turn on or something. I don't think so, though.

00:24:41
<transcript>: Enabled channel that follow so since it is enabled ingrock Adam Dev.

00:24:49
owchzzz: what song is this?

00:24:49
<transcript>: I know what the issue is. I'm glad I didn't rotate tokens. It's not tokens.

00:24:49
<transcript>: i

00:24:52
<transcript>: I know the issue is I deleted.

00:24:54
<transcript>: Okay.

00:24:58
<transcript>: I changed some DNS stuff and ingrock. I forgot.

00:24:58
<transcript>: was

00:25:04
<transcript>: Was on Adam Dev. So that's not gonna work. We're gonna have to fix it.

00:25:04
<transcript>: i can

00:25:09
<transcript>: I can come off fuzzy now I think after I close this tab.

00:25:09
<transcript>: okay

00:25:13
<transcript>: Okay, let's see. I'm gonna go off fuzzy.

00:25:19
<transcript>: Sorry for this, everybody. I don't like to stream pointless things. Like.

00:25:20
<transcript>: Me fixing.

00:25:23
<transcript>: Dns issues.

00:25:23
<transcript>: that are

00:25:25
<transcript>: That are related to my stream.

00:25:28
<transcript>: I just. I don't see it doesn't feel good.

00:25:30
<transcript>: But.

00:25:34
<transcript>: Could like turn off the stream and come back. That just feels bad too.

00:25:38
owchzzz: can we get a link to the playlist?

00:25:40
<transcript>: That also feels bad.

00:25:40
<transcript>: oh

00:25:41

<transcript>: Guess I need to go to Ingrock. Let's see.

00:25:59
<transcript>: How do I configure ngraq.

00:26:00
andom: Howdy HeyGuys

00:26:05
<transcript>: Ingrock.

00:26:10
<transcript>: Configure. I don't know. There's like a ingark.com.

<transcript>: So like, where is my the commercial offering? Like, where do I log in.

00:26:22
<transcript>: In Grock platform? Yeah. Dashboard.

<transcript>: Exams on Saturday. Cafes. That's exciting.

00:26:59
<transcript>: Minecraft tokens. Thank you for the follow Sant, Aemon and AYUSH. Sharma and Zirion. I think you all for the follows. I would have thanked you earlier, but my thing is broken and we're fixing it right now. Cloud a.

00:27:02
jaystation3x: ngrok sends a POST message to you to log in, so you have to be running ngrok.

00:27:03
<transcript>: Custom domain? See if I see domains? Yeah, here we go.

00:27:03
<transcript>: there we go

00:27:14
<transcript>: There we go. Okay. So I need to reset this up because I deleted the hosted zone because I'm dumb, and I forgot there were things that depend on it. So that's the thing.

00:27:21
<transcript>: We've got API Adam Dev. But then I'm managing Adam Dev on cloud Flare. Now.

00:27:31
<transcript>: Okay? Dns.

00:27:31
<transcript>: do i want to manage

00:27:33
<transcript>: Do I want to manage it here? I don't know.

00:27:36
<transcript>: Is that even working.

<transcript>: Yesterday I made a change in, like an hour later. It's still heading propagated. I thought it was broken or I made the wrong change. But this later I checked after I was out of my office and it worked. So it was just really slow.

<transcript>: i

00:32:06

<transcript>: Let's see.

00:47:47
<transcript>: I'm not sure where that happens.

00:47:47
<transcript>: create

00:47:50
<transcript>: Create subscription. I'm going to delete these.

00:47:54
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:47:59
<transcript>: Events.

00:48:09
<transcript>: There's a Twitter Oh, yeah, there's a Twitch API handler.

00:48:12
<transcript>: Now, what am I doing.

00:48:18
<transcript>: Twitch right here. This is where we handle? Yeah, Yeah.

00:48:22
<transcript>: Signatures Match notification.

00:48:28
<transcript>: It's somewhere. Here. We handle.

00:48:32
<transcript>: we return

00:48:32
<transcript>: Message type verification. This one.

00:48:35
<transcript>: We return the notification challenge.

00:48:50
<transcript>: Okay.

00:48:52
theruggedbear: anyone knows if there is a library with some regex patterns for js ? i can't find one

00:49:00
<transcript>: I guess what I want to do here is.

00:49:03
<transcript>: Get the response.

00:49:10
<transcript>: Response.

00:49:12
<transcript>: Well, no, that's just.

00:49:13
yuji_rexion: !project

00:49:13
fossabot: Today Adam is working on bitter, a serverless twitter. Built to test the limits of concurrency within the serverless world.

00:49:17
<transcript>: Sending. Wait, what? That's? Sending it back.

00:49:17
<transcript>: to

00:49:18
<transcript>: To them.

00:49:42
<transcript>: I'm sorry just trying to get the.

00:49:46
<transcript>: I'm trying to get my notifications working.

00:49:52
<transcript>: This is the problem with developers who stream. We do too much. We try to do too much.

00:49:55
<transcript>: Verification failed.

00:49:58
<transcript>: Those are enabled.

00:50:03
<transcript>: But some of the verifications are failing. I think this is all just DNS. I think it's just not.

00:50:03
<transcript>: resolving

00:50:06
<transcript>: Resolving fully for every request.

00:50:11
<transcript>: Channel Raid enabled.

00:50:13
<transcript>: But then.

00:50:17
<transcript>: Stream Online Verification failed.

00:50:21
<transcript>: Invalid JSON response body at.

00:50:22
<transcript>: That.

00:50:24
<transcript>: Okay.

00:51:21
<transcript>: There's a library with some REGIC signature. Js. I can't find one.

00:51:26
<transcript>: Like actual.

00:51:35
<transcript>: So let's just a 204 message when we delete just works, I guess.

00:51:37
<transcript>: Let's delete them all.

00:52:01
<transcript>: What just happened.

00:52:06
<transcript>: Did we do it? Okay. Now. If I restart it, I should see.

00:52:11
<transcript>: Now I'm going to.

00:52:17
<transcript>: This won't delete anything because there won't be an existing I believe.

00:52:17
<transcript>: so if

00:52:35
<transcript>: It should just be an empty yeah, yeah, Whoa. Why is it doing verifications? I didn't create any. Did I? Oh, I did create some.

00:52:39
<transcript>: Okay. So subscription pending verification.

00:52:42
<transcript>: There's the challenge.

00:52:56
<transcript>: It's not doing it for all of them, though, so I'm actually creating all of the.

00:52:59
<transcript>: Subscriptions.

00:53:03
<transcript>: Why.

00:53:06
<transcript>: Like that's channel update.

00:53:26
<transcript>: That it's got to be DNS like there's got to just be a stale DNS.

00:53:26
<transcript>: it

00:53:27
<transcript>: It's just failing.

00:53:32
<transcript>: On some of the messages. They're not making it to Ingrock. What a bummer.

00:53:32
<transcript>: that's

00:53:34
<transcript>: That's the thing I can think.

00:53:39
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:53:45
<transcript>: Jd Four. Thanks so much for the follow. Do you play BR? What's? Br.

00:53:49
<transcript>: brief

00:53:50
<transcript>: Brief.

00:53:59
<transcript>: Let's not delete.

00:54:02
tizi_kuro: any games that is battle royale

00:54:02
<transcript>: I want to restart it just to see.

00:54:04
<transcript>: Status.

00:54:16
<transcript>: Games anymore I used to.

00:54:19
<transcript>: Oh, no. Subscriptions.

00:54:21
<transcript>: Interesting.

00:54:29
<transcript>: How long did it take to make it to Affiliate when you first started streaming.

00:54:32
<transcript>: John. You know, I don't remember exactly.

00:54:40
<transcript>: I want to say it was it was a couple weeks. Maybe you have to or no, you had to have some days. I remember I had to stream for seven days.

00:54:40
<transcript>: and that was

00:54:44
<transcript>: And that was the thing I didn't have was seven days of streaming.

00:54:44
<transcript>: so thank

00:54:47
<transcript>: So thank I got affiliate pretty quick.

00:54:47
<transcript>: if i

00:54:50
<transcript>: If I recall correctly.

00:54:55
<transcript>: So why are there no subscriptions now? Didn't we just create some.

00:55:02
<transcript>: So busted.

00:55:04
johnernaut101: thats awesome!  i think theres like a 50 follower minimum too

00:55:08
<transcript>: Ingarak Adam Dev.

00:55:10
tizi_kuro: i was wondering how they persist the kill and damage numbers for each game . do spin up a db for each game and kill it?

00:55:13
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:55:21
<transcript>: I wonder if I was that ingrock dashboard.

00:55:24
<transcript>: Here.

00:55:26
tizi_kuro: i know . i feel dumber after asking this

00:55:26
<transcript>: Yeah, here.

00:55:32
<transcript>: Okay. Now it shows a check Mark. Like, I think it was showing that maybe.

00:55:32
<transcript>: the

00:55:38
<transcript>: The warning sign because it wasn't consistently even this wasn't consistently resolving.

00:55:43
<transcript>: Check status. Let's just check it a few times. Oops, close.

00:55:43
johnernaut101: @TiZi_kuro they definitely use some kind of DB for tracking game data

00:55:54
<transcript>: Just makes sure it consistently.

00:55:57
<transcript>: Resolves.

00:56:00
<transcript>: Okay.

00:56:03
<transcript>: One endpoint.

00:56:05
tizi_kuro: @johnernaut101 your mean like per lobby

00:56:08
<transcript>: This is good, I guess. Stable.

00:56:15
<transcript>: 27. Okay. So that's my tunnel.

00:56:22
daglee: I play a lot of games. It's called sitting in game lobby, doing other stuff, at 23:00 you close the game and go to bed. Great gaming experience.

00:56:23
<transcript>: I see. Right there.

00:56:27
<transcript>: See it's like it's not consistently.

00:56:31
<transcript>: I've never had this issue with any other DNS provider.

00:56:38
<transcript>: Like it. It's like the TTL was too long. Maybe just they have longer TTL defaults.

00:56:38
<transcript>: maybe

00:56:39
<transcript>: Maybe.

00:56:45
<transcript>: Okay. Well, I'm just gonna move on, I guess.

00:56:45
<transcript>: i won't have

00:56:46
johnernaut101: it could be done many, many ways, but a simplistic approach is probably a single DB with something like a "games" table that has foreign keys referencing a "lobbies" table or similar

00:56:55
<transcript>: I won't have notifications. I'll try to keep on Tapa on top of it. That means none of my redemptions will work, so maybe don't do those.

00:57:00
<transcript>: Michael Like, Why is it show degraded there.

00:57:17
<transcript>: Now it says Good. I think it's just flaky. I think there's still some DNS cache stuff going on.

00:57:20
<transcript>: 48 hours. It may take they say.

00:57:30
<transcript>: That's awesome. I think there's like a 50 following.

00:57:30
<transcript>: two

00:57:32
<transcript>: Two.

00:57:32
<transcript>: i was wondering

00:57:37
<transcript>: I was wondering how they persist. The kill and damage number. Street scam just set up a DB for each game and kill it.

00:57:42
tizi_kuro: @johnernaut101 make sense . but hella complicated

00:57:44
<transcript>: No, you don't need to feel them. I would think. I would think they have separate DBS for each game.

00:57:52
<transcript>: It's called sitting in game lobby, doing other stuff. At 23, you close the game and go to bed. Great gaming experience.

00:58:06
<transcript>: if not for

00:58:06
<transcript>: Could be done many, many ways, but a simplistic approach is probably a single DB with something like a games table that has four keys referencing a lobby stabilizer. Similar. Yeah, I'm gonna be building something similar here. In just a moment. I would have been building it already.

00:58:08
<transcript>: If not for DNS.

00:58:20
<transcript>: Yeah, we're building a game, an AWS guessing game and building on AWS, and I'm gonna be I'm moving it all over to a new we have built it like with the T three stack and pretty.

00:58:24
<transcript>: Much go hat today.

00:58:24
<transcript>: but

00:59:18
<transcript>: Verification pining.

00:59:25
<transcript>: Yeah, it doesn't seem to be able to verify. I want to if I do need to rotate my secrets or something.

00:59:30
<transcript>: Doesn't really make sense to me that I would need to.

00:59:41
johnernaut101: i managed my own vim config for like.. 10 years... then i tried lunarvim and without changing any settings realized it was vastly better than what ive been using FeelsBadMan

00:59:47
<transcript>: They all say verification, pinning. Now, that's good.

00:59:50
<transcript>: I don't see any verification failed messages.

00:59:50
<transcript>: hey maybe

00:59:52
<transcript>: Hey, maybe they're working now.

00:59:55
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat, easy.

01:00:08
<transcript>: You can't manage Web hooks, like in the Twitch Dashboard. Can you.

01:00:21
<transcript>: I don't believe so no.

01:00:26
<transcript>: Okay. Okay.

01:00:26
<transcript>: fine

01:00:28
<transcript>: Fine.

01:00:44
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. Can I just see the activity.

01:00:51
<transcript>: Can I see it.

01:00:59
<transcript>: I guess not is local estate thousand even where my thing runs.

01:01:03
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:01:13
<transcript>: Yeah, proxy server listen on a thousand.

01:01:15
<transcript>: Your Proxy server.

01:01:20
<transcript>: I'm not running this thing twice, am I.

01:01:24
<transcript>: What would that do.

01:01:29
<transcript>: What would that do if I were running it twice.

01:01:53
<transcript>: What's? The slide interface, too? Oh, yeah, yeah, I can see. Oh, look at this. I can see all the traffic here.

01:01:56
<transcript>: Verification pending.

01:02:03
<transcript>: I just understand. I don't. I'm not getting any.

01:02:03
<transcript>: oh

01:02:05
<transcript>: Oh, wait.

01:02:08
<transcript>: Wait.

01:02:12
<transcript>: What's this? Oh, that's me trying to get it.

01:02:16
<transcript>: Callback.

01:02:19
<transcript>: Pending. Oh, that one's enabled.

01:02:28
<transcript>: So I should have responded to all these with the appropriate.

01:02:28
<transcript>: is it

01:02:30
<transcript>: Is it show the response. Yeah.

01:02:30
<transcript>: with the challenge

01:02:31
<transcript>: With the challenge.

01:02:36
<transcript>: And then did they work? Is the question.

01:02:39
<transcript>: Do they tell me if.

01:02:39
<transcript>: they succeed

01:02:42
<transcript>: They succeed. I don't know if I get another pose after that.

01:02:50
<transcript>: But it looks like all of them made it here. Stream, channel, follow, channel, update, channel, follow.

01:02:53
<transcript>: Other two channel follows.

01:03:00
<transcript>: Are these sorted.

01:03:04
<transcript>: 19 minutes ago three minutes ago.

01:03:04
<transcript>: so

01:03:06
<transcript>: So it was only a few of them.

01:03:22
<transcript>: These. So these are here. This one. Follow stream on the stream offline sheer subscription, gift and raid. That's the only ones I got notifications for. So yeah, I think DNS is the issue. It'll work eventually. I hope.

01:03:23
johnernaut101: i wish nextjs had a good background jobs solution similar to sidekiq (highly configurable - runs in separate process - jobs can be unique, retriable, etc)

01:03:26
<transcript>: And for now we'll move on.

01:03:29
<transcript>: So overlays halfbroken.

01:03:29
<transcript>: let's see

01:03:33
<transcript>: Let's see I managed my own vimcon pig for like ten years.

01:03:40
<transcript>: Then I tried Lunarvim, and without changing any settings, realized it was vastly better than what I've been using.

01:03:54
<transcript>: I also tried Lunarvim. I think by the time I tried Lunarvim, I kind of knew what I wanted, and and I got a little frustrated with some of the like, pushing against the walls of Lunar vim.

01:04:00
<transcript>: I wish Nick Schiff had a good background Jobs solution similar to sidekick.

01:04:00
<transcript>: runs

01:04:03
<transcript>: Runs a separate province that's gonna be unique? Yeah, yeah, it's a big gap.

01:04:07
<transcript>: Wait, who's doing.

01:04:11
<transcript>: Who's doing? Who's doing this? Somebody's doing.

01:04:11
<transcript>: like

01:04:12
<transcript>: Like.

01:04:12
<transcript>: queued api

01:04:16
<transcript>: Queued API routes or something? Is there another? Is it another framework.

01:04:18
<transcript>: What am I thinking of.

01:04:21
<transcript>: Next JS.

01:04:26
<transcript>: Cron Routes or something.

01:04:32
<transcript>: I thought something was.

01:04:32
<transcript>: or was this a proposed

01:04:33
<transcript>: Or was this a proposed.

01:04:39
<transcript>: It's not built into.

01:04:42
<transcript>: Next. Yes.

01:04:49
<transcript>: So saying he's GitHub actions.

01:04:52
<transcript>: Oh, oh, I got a notification.

01:04:52
<transcript>: thanks

01:04:53
johnernaut101: yeah there are ways to use cron to hit your main application but its still pretty janky

01:04:58
<transcript>: Thanks so much for the follow. Wallace. I don't know how I got a notification. I thought they were broken.

01:05:02
vim_cerf: POGGERS

01:05:04
criswritescode: lunarvim is like sleeping in a hotel, it's good, but it doesn't feel like home

01:05:05
<transcript>: Enabled channel follow is enabled. Well, that might be the only one that's enabled, but we'll take it.

01:05:07
<transcript>: We'll take it.

01:05:16
<transcript>: Hey, thanks for the follow chinler. Feels good. Notification sounds in my ear.

01:05:24
<transcript>: What's it doing? Oh, yeah. Cron jobs. I. Where did I hear this? Who am I? Who am I thinking of.

01:05:27
johnernaut101: ^ yeah agreed, and i dont want to deal with API changes and breaking the custom stuff i have in there

01:05:30
<transcript>: Something was like trying to provide here's. All the providers.

01:05:30
<transcript>: so they're clearly

01:05:33
<transcript>: So they're clearly not building it in the next JS.

01:05:41
<transcript>: Still pretty Janky. I agree. I think next chance is missing a lot of.

01:05:41
<transcript>: backend

01:05:45
<transcript>: Backend things you need so Cron jobs are one of them.

01:05:52
<transcript>: I mean even just like you have to use other providers for your database like they could I don't know.

01:05:52
<transcript>: would the versail

01:06:01
<transcript>: Would the Versaille have an opportunity to go like full full stack and actually provide stuff for all the different backend things you need, like queues and.

01:06:01
<transcript>: asynchronous

01:06:04
<transcript>: Asynchronous jobs and stuff. Maybe.

01:06:10
<transcript>: Lunar Vim is like sleeping at a hotel. It's good, but it doesn't feel like home.

01:06:10
<transcript>: that's a good one

01:06:13
<transcript>: That's a good one. That's a good one. Chris.

01:06:13
<transcript>: and i don't

01:06:17
<transcript>: And I don't want to deal with API changes in breaking the custom stuff I have in there.

01:06:21
<transcript>: Yeah. Alright. Let's get to it.

01:06:24
<transcript>: What was I gonna do.

01:06:24
<transcript>: just

01:06:27
<transcript>: Just ignoring all this. Here we go. So we're moving.

01:06:27
<transcript>: i'm moving

01:06:30
<transcript>: I'm moving into a turbo repo.

01:06:43
<transcript>: Aws, I started this is the next app or the T three app, and now we're kind of like going to do something different. I was a little upset with the Cold Start performance of, like, the initial. Well, if you go to like, let me show you.

01:06:43
<transcript>: you've got a

01:06:45
<transcript>: You've got a to be guess.

01:06:54
<transcript>: This cold start when you click new game. Oh, that wasn't actually that bad. I guess it's been used today. I don't know.

01:07:02
<transcript>: I'm just not like enthusiastic with the database performance, and I feel like I should build it on.

01:07:02
<transcript>: i should build

01:07:04
<transcript>: I should build it on a Tobis.

01:07:07
<transcript>: It's also probably pretty slow.

01:07:07
<transcript>: if we throw

01:07:15
<transcript>: If we throw like it's probably pretty slow internationally. Everything's just in us. E Swan, I'm guessing or something like that.

01:07:15
<transcript>: and i'm gonna

01:07:20
<transcript>: And I'm gonna make it not slow Internationally because most of the AWS community is international.

01:07:20
<transcript>: and not

01:07:21
<transcript>: And not.

01:07:27
<transcript>: Focused in the US. It's a pretty big community that spread all over the place.

01:07:27
<transcript>: okay so we're

01:07:42
<transcript>: Okay, so we're gonna make a custom API just to have a little more control over performance and things like that. And because again, it's AWS guests or AW. Guess I should make it with AWS stuff. Feels better. Thanks for the follow Mr. Sexter. Also a million.

01:07:50
<transcript>: That I see a million. Thanks for the follow. What's gonna do here? I was gonna go network conditions. Let's go. We'll do fast. 3g.

01:07:56
<transcript>: So if I say new game that's probably not slow.

01:07:56
<transcript>: it's not super

01:08:02
<transcript>: It's not super fast. Oh, yeah. I gotta think about image Loading times. I'd really like to just Bake them in.

01:08:04
<transcript>: Is that glue.

01:08:04
<transcript>: i

01:08:08
<transcript>: I like to just Bake the images into the bundle. Is that a terrible idea.

01:08:11
johnernaut101: are the assets hosted in cloudfront?

01:08:14
<transcript>: Think the only way I can control like knowing that they saw the image for the whole time.

01:08:14
<transcript>: right

01:08:15
<transcript>: Right.

01:08:19
<transcript>: Media Live or Delta? Yeah.

01:08:23
<transcript>: Clap front.

01:08:31
<transcript>: Okay so let's not terrible on slow connection. The image Loading thing is a problem. What about slow 3G.

01:08:36
<transcript>: What is this.

01:08:38
<transcript>: Media store.

01:08:45
<transcript>: Okay. See, that was the very slow.

01:08:45
<transcript>: slow three

01:08:53
<transcript>: Slow 3G painful yeah. If I put them all in the bundle, I wonder how big the bundle will be if I put all the SVGs just like Bake them into the bundle.

01:08:58
<transcript>: All right, let's. We got a lot of work to do.

01:09:00
th3_l3m0n: can't you use the image onload event to only start the timer once the image has loaded?

01:09:10
<transcript>: I should get to it. Are the assets hosting in CloudFront? Yeah, they are. I know it's for cell. Can't you use the image onload event to only start the timer once the image is loaded.

01:09:10
<transcript>: yes

01:09:16
<transcript>: Yes, Lemon. I guess my problem with that is then the server. Is it really controlling.

01:09:16
<transcript>: the

01:09:19
<transcript>: The game state in a way I would like it to.

01:09:22
<transcript>: Like it's a client has.

01:09:25
<transcript>: Some say over.

01:09:29
<transcript>: The timing.

01:09:31
criswritescode: !awguess

01:09:31
fossabot: awguess is a guessing game where you're given an AWS service icon and you have to choose the correct service! https://github.com/adamelmore/awguess

01:09:31
<transcript>: That feels bad.

01:09:43
<transcript>: I will see I got a lot of other stuff to do before.

01:09:43
<transcript>: before

01:09:46
<transcript>: Before I get to any of that.

01:09:49
<transcript>: Let's see. We just need to.

01:09:53
<transcript>: Do I need to install type? Definitely.

01:09:53
<transcript>: not

01:09:54
<transcript>: Not.

01:09:54
<transcript>: delete all

01:09:56
<transcript>: Delete all the.

01:10:03
<transcript>: Probably install some stuff.

01:10:13
<transcript>: So secret JSON next off symmetry don't want that.

01:10:17
<transcript>: Subscription status.

01:10:19
<transcript>: None of that.

01:10:27
<transcript>: I guess I need the node types.

01:10:31
<transcript>: Node 16.

01:10:33
johnernaut101: depending on the # of images, you could potentially have one image with all of them in it and use CSS positioning to show the correct one within that image you want - that'd make all questions after the initial load show what you want instantly

01:10:38
<transcript>: If I seem to actually push the packages API.

01:10:42
<transcript>: And I wish I could use PMPM.

01:10:42
<transcript>: it sucks

01:10:46
<transcript>: It sucks when you know something is just a better experience and better and everyone.

01:10:46
<transcript>: and there's

01:10:51
<transcript>: And there's like a reason you can't use it. And that's the case.

01:10:53
<transcript>: For this project.

01:10:56
<transcript>: And any CUK projects.

01:10:56
<transcript>: cannot find

01:11:00
<transcript>: Cannot find module next off to John really.

01:11:03
<transcript>: What's wrong here.

01:11:09
<transcript>: What's the What's the problem.

01:11:14
<transcript>: Why is my authorizer.

01:11:14
<transcript>: so bus

01:11:16
<transcript>: So busted.

01:11:20
<transcript>: And so I'll type that initial for node. I mean I have.

01:11:31
<transcript>: Depending on the number of images, you could potentially have one image with all of them in it. Oh, sprites. Yes.

01:11:35
<transcript>: That'd make all questions after the initial load. Show what you want instantly.

01:11:35
<transcript>: yeah how big

01:11:38
<transcript>: Yeah. How big would that image be? I wonder.

01:11:38
<transcript>: it's

01:11:40
<transcript>: It's SVG too so like.

01:11:48
<transcript>: If it's SVG, would that be more or less efficient.

01:11:57
<transcript>: Don't know how much you can compare down a giant SVG Sprite.

01:12:02
<transcript>: And you just changing the viewport of the SDG.

01:12:03
<transcript>: That's interesting.

01:12:03
<transcript>: i will definitely

01:12:08
<transcript>: I will definitely look into it alright now I just gotta figure out why can't I get my editor.

01:12:08
<transcript>: to

01:12:10
<transcript>: To work.

01:12:10
johnernaut101: it should be pretty efficient unless theres a massive amount of images

01:12:26
<transcript>: I can't reliably type numbers.

01:12:26
<transcript>: i can't

01:12:28
<transcript>: I can't. That's my one.

01:12:37
<transcript>: Like one bummer with my neo vim usage is like, I want to use relative numbers, but I can't rely to like, hit numbers on my key. I just don't do it very often.

01:12:37
<transcript>: i think

01:12:39
<transcript>: I think for the follow John.

01:12:44
<transcript>: Could be pretty efficient unless there's a map of images. There's like 300 of them.

01:12:47
bassel_shmali: icon font maybe?

01:12:48
<transcript>: 300 AWS Services roughly.

01:12:55
<transcript>: This is bothering me. I don't understand. What is the what is the problem.

01:13:02
<transcript>: So is it using.

01:13:06
<transcript>: A new version of stuff.

01:13:06
<transcript>: graphql

01:13:07
<transcript>: Graphql.

01:13:10
<transcript>: Type script language server.

01:13:10
tsoutsou_proutsou: @types/node

01:13:16
<transcript>: Key.

01:13:24
<transcript>: What's wrong here? This is a TypeScript as you cannot find module next off job.

01:13:29
<transcript>: You cannot find process.

01:13:36
<transcript>: Why isn't it finding.

01:13:39
<transcript>: Wonder if this is a.

01:13:42
<transcript>: Hyper.

01:13:48
<transcript>: Types, node modules, types, nonmodel sites.

01:14:02
<transcript>: Well, why is why is it working in here? I guess. Or is it working in here.

01:14:05
<transcript>: Am I doing any node stuff.

01:14:05
<transcript>: let's do

01:14:06
<transcript>: Let's do.

01:14:12
<transcript>: Const table name or something equals process end.

01:14:12
<transcript>: table

01:14:13
<transcript>: Table.

01:14:13
<transcript>: name

01:14:20
<transcript>: Name? Is that working? No. Okay, so I don't have my editor set up correctly here with this TS? Config.

01:14:33
<transcript>: This should be excluding Lib functions and scripts.

01:14:40
<transcript>: So this has a special TS config on purpose.

01:14:42
<transcript>: What's the problem.

01:14:50
<transcript>: What is the problem.

01:14:56
<transcript>: Type definitions for node. I mean I.

01:15:06
<transcript>: 've Already Done this.

01:15:13
<transcript>: Maybe I'll try restarting.

01:15:16
<transcript>: In them. I don't know why that would be help, but.

01:15:27
<transcript>: One of those days.

01:15:27
<transcript>: packed node

01:15:28
<transcript>: Packed node.

01:15:28
<transcript>: yeah

01:15:31
<transcript>: Yeah. That's what I did, right.

01:15:44
andrasbacsai: Time to switch to PHP.

01:15:46
<transcript>: This is a tight script file.

01:15:48
tsoutsou_proutsou: @adamdotdev whats your feeling about vim?

01:15:49
<transcript>: We've got a special Tscon save right here.

01:15:57
<transcript>: Is there something wrong with this? Ts? Config.

01:16:00
<transcript>: Let me do this.

01:16:04
<transcript>: Open this.

01:16:21
<transcript>: Similar step.

01:16:25
<transcript>: Yes.

01:16:25
<transcript>: otherwise

01:16:27
<transcript>: Otherwise.

01:16:31
<transcript>: Okay.

01:16:36
<transcript>: Like I should have an authorizer in here. Oh.

01:16:52
<transcript>: So.

01:16:58
<transcript>: Everything seems to be working in this project.

01:16:58
<transcript>: what

01:17:01
<transcript>: What is different? There's an ESLint.

01:17:04
<transcript>: Look at this.

01:17:09
<transcript>: Cdk Lambda.

01:17:14
<transcript>: Yes.

01:17:16
caasidev: hey Adam, how are you?

01:17:17
<transcript>: Okay.

01:17:20
<transcript>: Type roots look like that.

01:17:25
<transcript>: This looks similar.

01:17:25
<transcript>: i think

01:17:28
<transcript>: I think of the follow R four.

01:17:31
<transcript>: My feeling about them.

01:17:31
<transcript>: i'm gonna

01:17:34
<transcript>: I'm gonna fan. I'm a fan of him.

01:17:34
<transcript>: tutzu

01:17:37
<transcript>: Tutzu. Hey, Cassie, I'm good. How are you.

01:17:43
<transcript>: Let's see time switch to PHP.

01:17:45
<transcript>: That would be one route I could take.

01:17:50
<transcript>: There's some thing wrong. So then do I need to look at the base.

01:17:55
<transcript>: I feel like I already brought all this over, but.

01:18:02
<transcript>: Is it something in the top level project? Let's see package dates on.

01:18:10
<transcript>: That CDK.

01:18:19
<transcript>: Exclude node modules and CDK out. Maybe I shouldn't be excluding. Okay, let's try that.

01:18:24
<transcript>: And not excluding in this one.

01:18:28
<transcript>: Not.

01:18:31
<transcript>: Exclude.

01:18:33
<transcript>: These.

01:18:54
<transcript>: App.

01:18:57
<transcript>: Come on.

01:18:57
<transcript>: what's wrong

01:18:58
<transcript>: What's wrong.

01:19:02
<transcript>: What is wrong.

01:19:06
<transcript>: Yes. Next.

01:19:14
<transcript>: I should have like.

01:19:32
<transcript>: Functions.

01:19:35
<transcript>: Disconfig.

01:19:45
<transcript>: Include.

01:19:45
nexxeln: !dotfiles

01:19:45
fossabot: Adam's dotfiles live here: https://github.com/adamelmore/dotfiles The repository for bitter is here: https://github.com/adamelmore/bitter

01:19:49
<transcript>: Exclude okay type roots.

01:20:15
<transcript>: Pipes. No modules.

01:20:20
<transcript>: Yes. 2022. So this is different.

01:20:27
<transcript>: Lib 2019 Target 2018 Module Esnec next.

01:20:32
<transcript>: 2022.

01:20:34
<transcript>: Adore.

01:20:41
<transcript>: Yes module Interop true.

01:20:47
<transcript>: This is so different. Why is it in such a different order anyway.

01:20:51
<transcript>: Okay.

01:20:59
<transcript>: Typescript, problems.

01:20:59
<transcript>: all we've been doing

01:21:03
<transcript>: All we've been doing is fiddling with stuff today.

01:21:08
<transcript>: Editors, and overlays.

01:21:08
<transcript>: and

01:21:09
<transcript>: And.

01:21:09
<transcript>: wearing me out

01:21:11
<transcript>: Wearing me out.

01:21:22
<transcript>: This is working right.

01:21:26
<transcript>: No TypeScript issues in this project.

01:21:33
<transcript>: It's even more complicated too, but I am using es Len.

01:21:38
<transcript>: Just one at CDK. Is that the problem.

01:21:48
<transcript>: Maybe that's the problem. I'm even needy a slant to get all this stuff glued together. I was doing all this stuff. Oh, I hate this. I hateous went so much.

01:21:55
<transcript>: Eslant TypeScript prettier the whole combination. Just sometimes this makes me so sad.

01:22:01
<transcript>: Yeah, we're gonna add yes, lint against my better judgment for this project.

01:22:08
<transcript>: Rc, JS.

01:22:12
<transcript>: Oh, I'm gonna regret this, aren't I.

01:22:15
<transcript>: Let's close Lib.

01:22:15
<transcript>: so here is

01:22:17
<transcript>: So here is this one.

01:22:17
<transcript>: just

01:22:20
<transcript>: Just config es CDK.

01:22:23
<transcript>: Go to that front CDK.

01:22:27
memph1s: @adamdotdev how long have you been using nvim

01:22:29
<transcript>: Okay.

01:22:39
<transcript>: Yes, LAN, where is it? Here.

01:22:46
<transcript>: So I need to install the stuff.

01:22:50
<transcript>: Darn push the.

01:22:50
<transcript>: yeah

01:22:54
<transcript>: Yeah, yarn. Add Dev.

01:22:55
<transcript>: What I need? Add.

01:22:55
<transcript>: let's go over here

01:22:57
<transcript>: Let's go over here.

01:23:02
<transcript>: All these things, right.

01:23:09
<transcript>: Yes, lint.

01:23:13
<transcript>: This lent config.

01:23:13
<transcript>: neck no

01:23:15
<transcript>: Neck. No prettier.

01:23:19
<transcript>: Slant. I don't see type script.

01:23:23
<transcript>: Pslat.

01:23:23
<transcript>: is

01:23:24
<transcript>: Is. Flint. Parser.

01:23:24
<transcript>: this is

01:23:29
sockenguy: Any troubles with nextjs13? Would you say one can use it for prod?

01:23:31
<transcript>: This is so much Web Pack. It just makes me so sad. Does this not remind everyone of, like doing anything with Web pack? Yes. Lent.

01:23:31
<transcript>: par

01:23:33
<transcript>: Parser.

01:23:42
<transcript>: And then ESLint. Import results.

01:23:46
<transcript>: Typescript.

01:23:53
<transcript>: There occurred.

01:23:53
<transcript>: yes not

01:23:55
<transcript>: Yes not parser, not found that I type it wrong.

01:24:04
<transcript>: Parser.

01:24:10
<transcript>: My script is slant.

01:24:10
<transcript>: yes

01:24:14
<transcript>: Yes, Lent plugin. Oh, I mess that up.

01:24:19
<transcript>: There we go.

01:24:34
<transcript>: See Memphis. Welcome to Chat. How long have you been using? Nvm it's been about three months. I think it was all on stream, so I didn't start using it until I started streaming on Twitch. And I've been streaming for, like four months.

01:24:34
<transcript>: so

01:24:40
<transcript>: So stocking guy any troubles with next year? 13? Would you say One can use it for prod? I would say.

01:24:42
<transcript>: Next 13 is.

01:24:42
<transcript>: a mix

01:24:51
nexxeln: do you actually like yarn

01:25:01
<transcript>: A mixed bag of bakedness if you will. So the layout stuff, all the new routing stuff if you use the app directory, that's a little less baked. So use that with caution. I think the component libraries, things like Next Font and Next Image and Next Link. All those updates seem to be pretty stable.

01:25:01
<transcript>: and

01:25:03
<transcript>: And then I would say.

01:25:03
<transcript>: turbo

01:25:18
<transcript>: turbo pack don't touch it i mean it's just not ready it's still very early so that's the spectrum of next thirteen or things they announced at next half like turbo pack super early we just got sneak peek and they probably shouldn't have released it even it wasn't really ready

01:25:25
<transcript>: But it's like they can do some benchmarks with it. And it's it was they had to be announced, like they had to do what they did.

01:25:29
<transcript>: Rounding stuff after actory.

01:25:29
<transcript>: semi ready

01:25:30
<transcript>: Semi ready.

01:25:30
<transcript>: there's still some

01:25:45
<transcript>: There's still some issues. Maybe they've worked out some of the issues that I saw when they first announced it and refers to released it. But there were some issues with bundle sizes and with things that were still kind of like working out the Kinks. It's some new stuff all around. It's all. React 18 experimental stuff.

01:25:45
<transcript>: or

01:25:48
sockenguy: yeah the routing is the most interesting for me, did not try it out yet

01:25:49
<transcript>: Or prereleased stuff. It's not like fully baked.

01:25:49
<transcript>: component

01:25:53
<transcript>: Component libraries in Knick 13. So the next font, next link, all that stuff.

01:25:53
<transcript>: superb

01:26:01
lilfreezi: sup

01:26:04
<transcript>: Superb use them. They're great and you can opt in to all the new next 13 stuff so you could upgrade to X 13 and not use the new App directory. Just use the Pages directory like you have.

01:26:04
<transcript>: and take advantage

01:26:08
<transcript>: And take advantage of the new Next font and updates the next image, next link, etc.

01:26:17
<transcript>: Do you actually like yarn? I don't next. I prefer PNPM. I can't use it in CDK projects.

01:26:17
<transcript>: for reasons

01:26:19
<transcript>: For reasons.

01:26:19
<transcript>: i think

01:26:23
<transcript>: I think DAX is working on that. And SSC, which will be nice.

01:26:23
<transcript>: but

01:26:27
<transcript>: But today you can't you just can't it sucks.

01:26:31
<transcript>: Okay. So that's my ESLint.

01:26:34
<transcript>: And then PS. Config.

01:26:40
<transcript>: So if I have you slant going now.

01:26:40
<transcript>: like this

01:26:44
<transcript>: Like this? Oh I disable the a slant in my.

01:26:44
<transcript>: oh

01:26:49
<transcript>: Oh, Sunny, I've actually turned on? I've used lint turned on in the oven.

01:27:06
<transcript>: Back on.

01:27:09
<transcript>: Regret this.

01:27:12
<transcript>: Already kind of regret it.

01:27:20
<transcript>: Okay. So now we should have.

01:27:25
<transcript>: Appsync authorizer, authorizer.

01:27:33
<transcript>: Oh, yes, one configuration found I already regret it so much.

01:27:33
<transcript>: it's

01:27:35
<transcript>: It's my TypeScript.

01:27:45
<transcript>: But we haven't got there yet. Let's see no Eslan found in Lib API functions, so I need to have one up there.

01:27:49
<transcript>: So Lib.

01:27:50
memph1s: I want to change webstorm to nvim but it feels like too much configuration required to feel comfort

01:27:53
<transcript>: Functions has its own eslant Oh.

01:27:55
<transcript>: Display CDK.

01:27:55
<transcript>: lambda

01:27:56
<transcript>: Lambda.

01:27:57
memph1s: is it worth?

01:27:59
<transcript>: What a nightmare.

01:28:05
johnernaut101: do builds actually fail?  if not could it just be something with your LSP settings?

01:28:05
<transcript>: What a nightmare. You're slant RC.

01:28:07
<transcript>: Js.

01:28:15
<transcript>: Does anyone understand any of this? Like I just. I never will.

01:28:21
<transcript>: I know the commonest module. Maybe convert to an E six module. Okay.

01:28:33
<transcript>: Let's restart, let's restart a slant or the LSP.

01:28:33
<transcript>: there is an

01:28:37
<transcript>: There is an Esplan configuration. Now that's the thing.

01:28:37
<transcript>: is

01:28:39
<transcript>: Is there? Is it's right there.

01:28:43
<transcript>: There's that one.

01:28:50
<transcript>: Let's restart.

01:28:54
<transcript>: What is it? It's like you just went D.

01:28:57
<transcript>: How do I restart it.

01:29:01
<transcript>: Anybody now.

01:29:05
<transcript>: Restart. Yes, ma'am.

01:29:09
<transcript>: Paste it before I can find it on Google.

01:29:12
johnernaut101: is it installed with brew?  brew restart eslint_d?

01:29:16
<transcript>: To bounce the background server.

01:29:16
<transcript>: yes

01:29:17
<transcript>: Yes, let.

01:29:17
<transcript>: 's

01:29:19
<transcript>: 's.

01:29:22
<transcript>: Think it's just this.

01:29:46
<transcript>: What's wrong with this project? Is it fundamentally just broken.

01:29:50
<transcript>: We've got a TS config in here.

01:29:53
<transcript>: Ts? Config here.

01:29:56
<transcript>: We're using yarn.

01:29:58
<transcript>: We have to.

01:30:03
<transcript>: I need to let's see.

01:30:05
<transcript>: Pipeline.

01:30:12
<transcript>: Looks fine.

01:30:15
<transcript>: Is workspaces because yeah packages.

01:30:15
<transcript>: okay

01:30:18
<transcript>: Okay API.

01:30:22
mattmancodes: is it because the eslint config isn't in the root dir?

01:30:24
<transcript>: What about.

01:30:30
<transcript>: Editor stuff in place.

01:30:34
<transcript>: Oh.

01:30:41
<transcript>: Is it because let's see.

01:30:41
<transcript>: i want to change

01:30:46
<transcript>: I want to change the Webstorm to invent, but it feels like too much configuration required to fill comfort.

01:30:54
<transcript>: I don't know if it's I don't think these are Neil. Them issues I'm having.

01:30:54
<transcript>: i think

01:30:57
<transcript>: I think they're TypeScript issues.

01:31:03
nikovirtala: isn't it .eslintrc.js ‚Äî hidden, with dot

01:31:13
<transcript>: Do builds actually fail. If not, it could just be something with your elderly settings. It could be yeah, we'll try that, John. We'll try and actually build it as a installed brew brew. Restartia Slant D is it because the ESL pig isn't in the root directory? I have one in the root of that project.

01:31:13
<transcript>: via sl

01:31:21
<transcript>: Via Slantrc JS oh, Did I forget a dot? Oh, Nico, oh, did I forget the dot.

01:31:21
<transcript>: i forgot

01:31:22
<transcript>: I forgot the dot.

01:31:26
<transcript>: I'm dumb. Okay, let's do that.

01:31:39
<transcript>: Okay. So here's my file.

01:31:39
<transcript>: we did not

01:31:42
<transcript>: We did not put dots in front of.

01:31:50
<transcript>: Complaining about.

01:31:50
<transcript>: stuff if i don't

01:31:52
<transcript>: Stuff if I don't know how to name files.

01:31:59
<transcript>: I still don't think I should need a slant just to get type script working.

01:32:00
mattmancodes: LUL

01:32:04
<transcript>: I'm just trying to mirror what I'm doing over here, you know, just trying to do the same thing.

01:32:07
<transcript>: Hopefully.

01:32:10
<transcript>: File ignored by default.

01:32:17
memph1s: good catch @nikovirtala

01:32:27
<transcript>: Matches what we did on the other one. I just didn't want to have separate packages for TS config and for Eslink config that just felt like too much. I don't know that level of.

01:32:30
<transcript>: Granularity in my packages.

01:32:30
<transcript>: working

01:32:33
<transcript>: Working on this thing alone. So.

01:32:36
<transcript>: Okay. We've done all that.

01:32:36
<transcript>: now

01:32:42
<transcript>: Now let's see what happens when we open our authorizer.

01:32:47
<transcript>: Everything is so broken.

01:32:50
<transcript>: Okay. I need a larvae.

01:33:04
<transcript>: What is going on here.

01:33:08
zgredfred1: what is error exactly?

01:33:11
<transcript>: I'm building it.

01:33:14
cowfacedude99: why is it when I come in and your esliint/tsserver is broken?

01:33:21
<transcript>: We have TypeScript. Yeah.

01:34:03
<transcript>: When I come in and you're eslamp CS server is broken I don't know.

01:34:03
<transcript>: but it bums

01:34:05
<transcript>: But it bums me out.

01:34:12
<transcript>: Okay, so for one thing, there are actual build errors in the file. I just haven't gotten to the yet.

01:34:19
<transcript>: Because of all this nonsense. I guess so. I need to actually add.

01:34:22
<transcript>: Next off.

01:34:28
<transcript>: You need to actually add that.

01:34:32
<transcript>: Wait. Was that a legitimate issue this whole time.

01:34:37
<transcript>: The node things still doesn't make sense to me, but was that a legitimate issue.

01:34:39
<transcript>: Only that.

01:34:41
<transcript>: Did all just go away.

01:34:43
<transcript>: It's a top level away, not working.

01:34:47
<transcript>: That's why I had set here.

01:34:48
<transcript>: Just next.

01:34:54
<transcript>: Wait.

01:34:54
<transcript>: is it all

01:34:56
<transcript>: Is it all better now.

01:35:01
<transcript>: So now it's all better? Is it all better.

01:35:04
<transcript>: Get rid of you slant.

01:35:09
<transcript>: That's not let's save this. That's done.

01:35:12
<transcript>: Nope. Delete it.

01:35:17
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:35:22
<transcript>: So if we take oh, I need to remove all the.

01:35:22
<transcript>: stuff

01:35:23
<transcript>: Stuff.

01:35:34
zgredfred1: maybe put .eslint.js in root folder

01:35:35
<transcript>: Okay. So I legitimate.

01:35:38
<transcript>: Was lacking that package.

01:35:38
<transcript>: the

01:35:40
<transcript>: The note thing was interesting.

01:35:40
<transcript>: and

01:35:43
<transcript>: And it just went away.

01:35:51
<transcript>: Should no longer be.

01:35:51
<transcript>: let's just go back

01:35:52
<transcript>: Let's just go back.

01:35:52
<transcript>: and

01:35:53
<transcript>: And.

01:35:53
zirus16: eslint config is better on root dir

01:35:57
<transcript>: Remove it again.

01:36:18
cowfacedude99: you need to rm packages and and reinstall I gues

01:36:20
<transcript>: Legitimate issues? Legitimate issues? We're good.

01:36:26
<transcript>: Need to remove packages and reinstall oh, you know what? I do need to actually.

01:36:44
<transcript>: And then.

01:37:03
<transcript>: There's CDK out. No. Okay.

01:37:06
<transcript>: Now.

01:37:10
<transcript>: The Yarn install.

01:37:15
<transcript>: Out here. Right.

01:37:19
theruggedbear: find . -name 'node_modules' -type d -prune -exec rm -rf '{}' +     save this if using a monorepo and what to reinstall packages

01:37:33
cr4xr3v: what's popd?

01:37:36
cowfacedude99: I don't get why rm -rf something and rm something -rf mean different things in mac while they don't in linux.

01:37:53
cowfacedude99: @CR4xR3V directory stack.

01:38:01
<transcript>: Let me try Dominion me. I'm sorry if it didn't work.

01:38:04
<transcript>: My subscriptions are not working.

01:38:23
<transcript>: Oh, does he failed.

01:38:31
<transcript>: I should? Yeah.

01:38:31
<transcript>: enabled enabled

01:38:32
cowfacedude99: pushd something gets you to directory, and when you do popd, you go back to previous dir from where you did pushd

01:38:32
<transcript>: Enabled enabled.

01:38:34
<transcript>: Enabled.

01:38:34
<transcript>: verification

01:38:36
<transcript>: Verification failed.

01:38:41
<transcript>: So some of them had failed earlier.

01:38:43
<transcript>: Did they all succeed now.

01:38:47
<transcript>: See.

01:38:53
cowfacedude99: I did see a 204 too

01:39:01
<transcript>: Half of minute ago less than a minute ago.

01:39:06
<transcript>: So it's. Yeah, it's just clearly broken. I don't know.

01:39:09
<transcript>: I blame DNS. But I don't know.

01:39:16
<transcript>: Okay. This is working. Now. Now, we have legitimate issues here. Like this.

01:39:21
<transcript>: Okay.

01:39:27
<transcript>: Gotta get to moving? We're just so far from where I want to be with AWS, Reinvent. Two weeks.

01:39:35
cr4xr3v: ha, been using bash for sometime, it's a first for me lol, thanks

01:39:46
<transcript>: Okay.

01:39:58
<transcript>: So authorizer do I need to get the user.

01:40:05
<transcript>: I guess I do.

01:40:12
zirus16: maybe try the airbnb-eslint config.

01:40:20
<transcript>: Where is this.

01:40:20
zirus16: for me is the best.

01:40:33
<transcript>: Check out my.

01:42:02
milesgrr: I'm impressed with the transitions lol

01:44:17
vim_cerf: @milesgrr wait until he comes back and you realize it's real time and not recorded

01:46:02
milesgrr: @milesgrr yeah, I saw that when he left.

01:46:53
milesgrr: is it a trackpad next to the keyboard?

01:48:27
nexxeln: yes @milesgrr

01:52:03
<transcript>: Is was my music playing during my break? Was there no music.

01:52:03

01:52:37
<transcript>: And ratzug and Ritz crackers.

01:52:40
<transcript>: If I didn't see those.

01:52:46
<transcript>: Just weird stuff. Weird stuff going on in my machine.

01:52:46
<transcript>: in my project

01:52:47
<transcript>: In my project.

01:52:49
<transcript>: Let's work through it.

01:52:49
<transcript>: let's

01:52:52
<transcript>: Let's I gotta make the progress and we get all this plumbing done with.

01:52:52
<transcript>: this thing

01:52:54
<transcript>: This thing. Let's play some music.

01:52:58
<transcript>: Yep. Now things are better.

01:53:00
<transcript>: Databases, user.

01:53:04
<transcript>: Database item.

01:53:06
<transcript>: Copy.

01:53:10
<transcript>: Some tights.

01:53:13
<transcript>: This one.

01:53:23
<transcript>: Let's database user incorrectly extends database item.

01:53:31
<transcript>: And type ring compatible? Oh, yeah? Yeah? So we need let's see, user.

01:53:33
<transcript>: Handle.

01:53:41
<transcript>: Where did User come from.

01:53:41
<transcript>: probably from

01:53:44
<transcript>: Probably from Generated. Yeah, Yeah.

01:53:47
<transcript>: Oh, so much to do.

01:53:51
<transcript>: We're gonna do.

01:53:51
<transcript>: i just

01:53:54
<transcript>: I just went over there. Yeah, Yeah.

01:53:59
<transcript>: I think for the follow AC Rocha.

01:54:04
<transcript>: See, I want.

01:54:07
<transcript>: Schema.

01:54:07
<transcript>: let's look at

01:54:10
<transcript>: Let's look at the.

01:54:11
<transcript>: User.

01:54:14
<transcript>: We're gonna copy that.

01:54:17
cowfacedude99: guess the notifications are up again

01:54:22
<transcript>: Profile.

01:54:39
<transcript>: Why don't I keep doing that.

01:54:39
<transcript>: so

01:54:40
<transcript>: So query.

01:54:42
cowfacedude99: isn't all this generated? why are you copying it?

01:54:55
<transcript>: Domain available? No me get me yeah available username I guess do we need usernames? I think I'm just gonna use.

01:54:55
<transcript>: like tw

01:54:58
<transcript>: Like Twitter handle or something as your username.

01:55:02
<transcript>: Email type.

01:55:05
<transcript>: Name, image.

01:55:08
<transcript>: Username no domain.

01:55:10
<transcript>: No email, very.

01:55:14
<transcript>: This will just be handled.

01:55:19
<transcript>: No available. We're just gonna have you can set yourself.

01:55:22
<transcript>: Okay email type.

01:55:22
<transcript>: name image

01:55:32
<transcript>: Name image handle the only reason there is a username at all, but the only reason we have the concept of users just for the leaderboard. So there's gonna be a leaderboard where.

01:55:32
<transcript>: you can like

01:55:34
cowfacedude99: or are you picking this from public.dev?

01:55:34
<transcript>: You can like rank on this leaderboard, right.

01:55:41
<transcript>: Picking I'm picking up from public Dev cafe.

01:55:44
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:55:54
<transcript>: I think it's gonna be in common here.

01:55:54
<transcript>: oh

01:55:55
<transcript>: Oh.

01:55:55
<transcript>: i guess i need

01:55:58
<transcript>: I guess I need to do this too.

01:56:01
<transcript>: Not admin.

01:56:01
<transcript>: could be

01:56:02
<transcript>: Could be.

01:56:10
<transcript>: Off? Oh, yeah? I gotta do all this. I really need to package all this up.

01:56:16
<transcript>: Graph QLS.

01:56:24
<transcript>: Writer. Fredericken Type Scope. Access Token Token type.

01:56:27
<transcript>: Okay.

01:56:27
<transcript>: what email

01:56:29
<transcript>: What email? Verify. I'm not.

01:56:38
<transcript>: Get user okay create account create user verification token I guess if I want to just support email sign up, I need to have all that.

01:56:41
<transcript>: Okay.

01:56:45
<transcript>: Now I'm gonna need a bunch of other stuff.

01:56:52
<transcript>: Subscription.

01:56:57
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:57:02
<transcript>: Off all of these.

01:57:07
<transcript>: Let's just do this. And.

01:57:11
<transcript>: Let's say copy.

01:57:16
<transcript>: Recursively.

01:57:19
<transcript>: Copy, user.

01:57:23
<transcript>: Code.

01:57:26
<transcript>: Click Dev slash.

01:57:26
<transcript>: packages

01:57:27
<transcript>: Packages.

01:57:30
<transcript>: Api.

01:57:33
<transcript>: Lib auth.

01:57:37
<transcript>: All of those into.

01:57:39
<transcript>: Code.

01:57:45
<transcript>: Packages, API.

01:57:50
<transcript>: What is it? Lib.

01:57:55
<transcript>: I think it's resolved.

01:57:57
<transcript>: What did I say.

01:58:03
<transcript>: Solvers Yeah.

01:58:08
<transcript>: Resolver.

01:58:11
<transcript>: It worked. Okay.

01:58:15
<transcript>: Create user.

01:58:19
<transcript>: A lot of stuff. A lot of stuff here. There's no versions anymore.

01:58:24
<transcript>: Let's see current version of Get Out of here.

01:58:24
<transcript>: setting

01:58:27
<transcript>: Settings? None of this.

01:58:29
<transcript>: Version.

01:58:34
<transcript>: Put item is just put user. We don't need this.

01:58:42
<transcript>: User transaction items. So this doesn't even need to be a transaction. It just needs to be a put item.

01:58:48
<transcript>: We'll come back to that create your response.

01:58:48
<transcript>: be simpler

01:58:50
<transcript>: Be simpler as well.

01:58:52
<transcript>: Fact.

01:58:57
<transcript>: Where where does this code.

01:59:08
<transcript>: I need to go and create my front end.

01:59:13
<transcript>: This is all the interplay between Next auth.

01:59:16
<transcript>: And my AWS, API.

01:59:23
<transcript>: Should probably start like actually doing these things, though. So this is a delete item.

01:59:33
<transcript>: Create user response will just be deleted.

01:59:37
<transcript>: Right.

01:59:38
<transcript>: No.

01:59:38
<transcript>: let's

01:59:40
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:59:40
<transcript>: get account

01:59:45
<transcript>: Get account create account I need just to put item yeah here we go.

01:59:49
<transcript>: What is all this account provider.

01:59:59
<transcript>: Ew Lidsub provider. Okay. Yeah, that's all good. Because if I do like Twitter and if I want to like Discord and Twitter, that's how you can off into this thing. Thank you for the follows. The Corian.

02:00:02
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:00:07
<transcript>: So curious if this is working now.

02:00:13
<transcript>: It is some of my webhooks are working now feels good.

02:00:20
<transcript>: Attribute values are account.

02:00:25
<transcript>: Type account.

02:00:29
<transcript>: Okay.

02:00:35
<transcript>: I think all that's good.

02:00:41
<transcript>: The Global Secondary Index Account provider. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. This is all good.

02:00:46
<transcript>: Account create user.

02:00:46
<transcript>: i could

02:00:47
<transcript>: I could have used.

02:00:52
<transcript>: Next boss.

02:00:59
<transcript>: Because I could not use next off I could use.

02:01:06
<transcript>: Now I'm gonna use next class for sure.

02:01:11
<transcript>: So I'm going to copy this. This right here.

02:01:13
<transcript>: Just the whole thing.

02:01:16
<transcript>: The whole thing.

02:01:23
<transcript>: Create user is now going to look more like that.

02:01:30
<transcript>: The User ID.

02:01:32
<transcript>: Is an AutoID.

02:01:34
<transcript>: Now.

02:01:36
<transcript>: User.

02:01:39
<transcript>: Okay.

02:01:39
<transcript>: so instead

02:01:41
<transcript>: So instead of.

02:01:45
<transcript>: User User ID.

02:01:48
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow.

02:01:50
<transcript>: follows

02:01:51
<transcript>: Follows.

02:01:56
<transcript>: Let's see all these created type.

02:02:02
<transcript>: All that. So it's basically just going to be.

02:02:04
<transcript>: This.

02:02:16
cowfacedude99: do use use https://github.com/lepture/vim-velocity for vtl templates?

02:02:18
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:02:23
<transcript>: And then just delete all this.

02:02:23
<transcript>: oh wait wait

02:02:27
<transcript>: Oh, wait, wait. Gsi PK one. Do I need to put anything on the GSI.

02:02:32
<transcript>: For a user, we're gonna say no for now.

02:02:40
<transcript>: So now we have used.

02:03:00
<transcript>: Your User ID.

02:03:06
cowfacedude99: I guess that thing is old as anything I have seen but it would work I think

02:03:09
<transcript>: That one's good. We can just delete this one.

02:03:14
<transcript>: This isn't a function, though. Am I supposed to be stashing that.

02:03:17
<transcript>: Function.

02:03:20
<transcript>: Yeah, I probably split it. Yeah, Yeah.

02:03:30
<transcript>: Okay user is stashed.

02:03:34
<transcript>: And we.

02:03:34
<transcript>: write it

02:03:35
<transcript>: Write it.

02:03:40
<transcript>: Okay.

02:03:49
<transcript>: And then.

02:03:53
<transcript>: The Create user. We're just gonna say.

02:04:00
<transcript>: I don't know why not just really.

02:04:14
<transcript>: Accounts just doesn't delete item.

02:04:19
<transcript>: Click Account previous result.

02:04:26
<transcript>: I should probably just return a boolean but delete users.

02:04:31
<transcript>: Actually.

02:04:34
<transcript>: All the records in that.

02:04:34
<transcript>: partition

02:04:36
<transcript>: Partition.

02:04:39
<transcript>: Get account.

02:04:43
<transcript>: Provider for navigate queries? I won.

02:04:47
<transcript>: 't count response feels good.

02:04:52
<transcript>: User by account if not previous result return.

02:04:56
<transcript>: Id. Okay, that all looks good.

02:04:56
<transcript>: we can

02:04:57
<transcript>: We can delete.

02:05:00
<transcript>: Heat, stuff.

02:05:04
<transcript>: Serverless beat thing.

02:05:04
<transcript>: another

02:05:07
<transcript>: Another day because this is create account.

02:05:07
<transcript>: i see no

02:05:10
<transcript>: I see no reason why I can't just leave all this.

02:05:16
<transcript>: Create user.

02:05:20
<transcript>: Doesn't need to have let's see.

02:05:20
<transcript>: create user

02:05:21
<transcript>: Create user.

02:05:21
<transcript>: and create

02:05:27
<transcript>: And create page so this is different now. We just need this doesn't need to be a pipeline anymore.

02:05:31
<transcript>: So function.

02:05:34
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:05:38
<transcript>: Create.

02:05:43
<transcript>: User. Okay. That's the only place that it's called. Yeah. So here's what we can do.

02:05:47
<transcript>: We can go up here and rename so we can delete this one.

02:05:50
<transcript>: Oh, it stashes. The name.

02:05:55
<transcript>: Ashes the name.

02:05:59
<transcript>: We're going to delete it.

02:06:02
<transcript>: We're gonna rename this one.

02:06:08
<transcript>: The mutation.

02:06:11
<transcript>: Create user.

02:06:14
<transcript>: username

02:06:14

02:06:34
<transcript>: Mutation.

02:06:34
<transcript>: did it

02:06:35
<transcript>: Did it.

02:06:38
<transcript>: Some mutation create user.

02:06:42
<transcript>: The response just returns to the stash.

02:06:45
<transcript>: Although I think I can just.

02:06:50
<transcript>: Return the default, which is the response.

02:06:50
<transcript>: okay

02:06:53
<transcript>: Okay create user.

02:06:55
<transcript>: It looks good at the put item.

02:07:00
<transcript>: Create verification tokens. Just a put item. That's fine.

02:07:04
<transcript>: I'd be using it right now. Delete account.

02:07:04
<transcript>: does it get

02:07:08
<transcript>: Does it get account and then a delete account? Why does it get account.

02:07:15
<transcript>: Oh, because it queries all the records in.

02:07:19
<transcript>: Okay.

02:07:25
<transcript>: So everything under that account gets queried, and then we delete all of it.

02:07:28
<transcript>: Stash the account.

02:07:36
<transcript>: I don't understand delete account.

02:07:39
<transcript>: I don't think it's right get account delete account.

02:07:47
<transcript>: Bleed. User should just be what user partition delete user.

02:07:51
<transcript>: Okay so get user particip.

02:07:52
<transcript>: participation

02:07:52
<transcript>: Participation.

02:07:56
<transcript>: First get user petition.

02:08:03
<transcript>: Function get user.

02:08:06
<transcript>: Partition.

02:08:18
<transcript>: So we need to copy these over.

02:08:24
<transcript>: Think for the follow DP. Medina.

02:08:33
<transcript>: Vim velocity for VTL templates. Oh, no, I didn't. Is there's a there's stuff in Vim for VTL templates.

02:08:39
<transcript>: It would work, I think. Oh, interesting. Caufas. I will take a look. I was just.

02:08:39
<transcript>: raw dog at a

02:08:41
<transcript>: Raw dog at a just text files.

02:08:41
<transcript>: i'm saying

02:08:42
<transcript>: I'm saying.

02:08:46
<transcript>: Something get user partition.

02:08:52
<transcript>: Paste. That here.

02:09:02
<transcript>: Okay.

02:09:05
<transcript>: Let's just do this.

02:09:16
<transcript>: Now.

02:09:18
<transcript>: User.

02:09:21
<transcript>: And this one's gonna be.

02:09:25
<transcript>: Function.

02:09:28
<transcript>: Get user partition.

02:09:32
<transcript>: Okay.

02:09:38
<transcript>: Use our partition. Now it's this.

02:09:38
<transcript>: user

02:09:40
<transcript>: User with their ID.

02:09:40
<transcript>: does a query

02:09:41
<transcript>: Does a query.

02:09:41
<transcript>: that all sounds good

02:09:48
<transcript>: That all sounds good. And then this just reserve turns all the items. Okay. So delete user.

02:09:48
<transcript>: gets all the

02:09:53
<transcript>: Gets all the items and then does delete user a function delete user here.

02:09:57
<transcript>: Goes through each item.

02:09:57
<transcript>: if it's

02:10:00
<transcript>: If it's an item type user stash it.

02:10:06
<transcript>: And then we delete all those batch, delete all those. Okay.

02:10:06
<transcript>: everything

02:10:09
<transcript>: Everything under the user's record that sounds good.

02:10:19
<transcript>: And then this just returns the stash user delete verification token. Feels good. Okay. All those functions and all those mutations that we just added are good.

02:10:23
<transcript>: And this.

02:10:32
<transcript>: Get my profile. Yeah, I can delete that we'll bring over the Mi thing.

02:10:37

02:11:20
<transcript>: Create user create account.

02:11:24
<transcript>: Lead account. Okay, all those should be wired up now.

02:11:30
<transcript>: We've got VTL templates for all of that stuff.

02:11:34
<transcript>: Okay.

02:11:34
<transcript>: let's see

02:11:35
<transcript>: Let's see.

<transcript>: So resolvers we're gonna go.

02:12:19
<transcript>: Get user partition. We're gonna go.

02:12:28
<transcript>: A function get user from session.

02:12:51
<transcript>: Verify subscriber verify username I don't need those update user. I might need update user actually.

02:12:53
<transcript>: Mutation.

02:12:57
<transcript>: Mutate mutation.

02:13:00
<transcript>: Update user.

02:13:04
<transcript>: Request VTL.

02:13:08
<transcript>: And then I need.

02:13:18
<transcript>: Query.

02:13:24
<transcript>: All these get users.

02:13:28
<transcript>: Except for maybe username. But we'll just remove that.

02:13:33
<transcript>: And then I need query me.

02:13:41
<transcript>: I need user current. No, that's a different thing. Okay.

02:13:41
<transcript>: whoo

02:13:42

<transcript>: Brought that over. Yeah.

02:14:46
<transcript>: What.

02:15:00
<transcript>: Okay. It's doing the amplifier thing, which is like build up an expression based on what changed. I guess that's fine.

02:15:03
<transcript>: There's nothing specific.

02:15:08
<transcript>: To our use or to public Dev in there. I don't think there is. Okay.

02:15:10
<transcript>: Update user. Then we have Git user.

02:15:21
<transcript>: We have get used to by account.

02:15:33
<transcript>: Get user by email.

02:15:40

02:15:43
<transcript>: Okay.

02:15:49
<transcript>: Oh, what do I just do.

<transcript>: Repo is going to be.

02:17:25
<transcript>: Aws.

02:17:33
<transcript>: Stream. Listener node 14.

02:17:36
<transcript>: I do anything with the Stream Lister right now.

02:17:44
<transcript>: The table. Okay, we got to add a GSI here.

02:17:49
<transcript>: Let's go.

02:17:56
<transcript>: It's going to be called.

02:17:58
<transcript>: Email.

<transcript>: our movie mail

02:18:37
<transcript>: Our movie mail verified. I maybe shouldn't have done that, but.

02:18:41
<transcript>: Okay. So we store these email.

02:20:17
<transcript>: Hydrate.

02:20:17
<transcript>: okay

02:20:25
<transcript>: Okay. Extract pipeline. Config. Yeah. This is all the stuff I should. I should put this in a construct. Thanks so much for the follow. Chief Henry.

02:20:25
<transcript>: i should put all

02:20:31
<transcript>: I should put all this in one big like CDK construct so I don't just copy it over from project, project.

02:20:36
<transcript>: Over pads.

02:20:49
sockthedev: got your database cap on in prep for the launch? :)

02:20:54
<transcript>: All the sales. Fine. So now I've got the basis for like, I should have off. Let's get off in place in a new next year, 13 apps. And then I can start actually putting the game back together. We've got humptydumpty and a million pieces, and we need to put it back together again.

02:20:58
<transcript>: So does this build.

02:21:01
<transcript>: I guess we have query.

02:21:01
<transcript>: we

02:21:04
sockthedev: i spam refreshing their twitter profile

02:21:07
<transcript>: We have all the off pieces. Oh, I need to go in here. Let's. Yeah, let's try building because.

02:21:12
<transcript>: Yarn builds we need the code Gen, which is going to do now.

02:21:17
<transcript>: And then we can actually import some of these things.

02:21:22
<transcript>: Okay so stream listeners shouldn't be doing.

02:21:25
<transcript>: Actual things right now.

02:21:30
<transcript>: We can just say that could be user.

02:21:36
<transcript>: Table names not even used. Shouldn't be. Yeah, I was just. Okay.

02:21:39
<transcript>: So stream listener doing nothing right now. That's fine.

02:21:43
<transcript>: The build if I take that out.

02:21:46
detoxmango: who's the most similar to Prometheus?

02:21:47
<transcript>: Oh, now that I've generated I should actually.

02:21:50
<transcript>: No, it's not gonna build. I need to go back to the authorizer.

02:21:56
<transcript>: And we can start doing stuff.

02:21:59
<transcript>: Database user from types.

02:22:05
<transcript>: Do I not have.

02:22:05
<transcript>: dynamodb

02:22:06
<transcript>: Dynamodb.

02:22:11
<transcript>: I delete it in this. Let's see.

02:22:15
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:22:20
<transcript>: Authorized.

02:22:25
<transcript>: There's no time.

02:22:25
<transcript>: in here

02:22:26
<transcript>: In here.

02:22:30
<transcript>: Oh, cuz I'll get user I got you, I got you.

02:22:34
<transcript>: So I abstracted that into this.

02:22:39
<transcript>: Here's where all the table name stuff.

02:22:42
<transcript>: Okay.

02:22:52
<transcript>: Dynamodb client.

02:22:58
<transcript>: Let's just grab all those two.

02:23:12
<transcript>: Query Command, Database subscription.

02:23:15
<transcript>: What's database, subscription.

02:23:22
<transcript>: Okay.

02:23:32
<transcript>: So here I don't need the stuff. So this does work now and work now get user called that that's fine.

02:23:32
<transcript>: but then

02:23:34
<transcript>: But then I don't need this. There's no subscriber.

02:23:34
<transcript>: concept

02:23:35
<transcript>: Concept.

02:23:38
<transcript>: Right.

02:23:48
<transcript>: At the Knife fields. See Paid Actions Are No Paid Actions. Contact Resolver. Contact subscriber.

02:23:52
<transcript>: Nope.

02:23:52
<transcript>: so

02:23:54
<transcript>: So actually.

02:24:01
<transcript>: Resolver.

02:24:01
<transcript>: content

02:24:04
<transcript>: Content should just be decoded.

02:24:11
<transcript>: Return contacts? Yeah.

02:24:11
<transcript>: let's see

02:24:13
<transcript>: Let's see. No paid actions.

02:24:21
<transcript>: Resolve Resolver context should just be okay. I don't need to query command. I guess.

02:24:25
<transcript>: Just.

02:24:25
<transcript>: nothing else

02:24:29
<transcript>: Nothing else on it for now. Okay. Our authorizer is good.

02:24:31
<transcript>: It's good.

02:24:31
<transcript>: who

02:24:35
<transcript>: Who's the most similar to Prometheus Prometheus.

<transcript>: is that a database

02:24:39
<transcript>: Is that a database.

02:25:29
<transcript>: What.

02:25:31
<transcript>: No remember.

02:25:31
<transcript>: it's okay

02:25:35

<transcript>: Es, 2022 is 2019.

02:26:03
<transcript>: So here that I did es 2022. Let's see if that helps with the build first. Let's go into types.

02:26:06
<transcript>: User.

02:26:10
<transcript>: Import from.

02:26:10
<transcript>: i want

02:26:13
<transcript>: I want to import from generated.

02:26:22

02:29:08
<transcript>: I'm happy for you in the future.

02:29:10
<transcript>: Yeah, I've seen monolith. That's good.

02:29:13
<transcript>: I.

02:29:13
<transcript>: 'm looking at

02:29:16
<transcript>: 'm Looking at here Database item.

02:29:16
<transcript>: no

02:29:19
<transcript>: No. Let's go over here. Thank you for the follow. Pandaris.

02:29:23
<transcript>: So we got our API stack.

02:29:23
<transcript>: let's look

02:29:26
detoxmango: because i learned trading strategies that can potentially make billions and not just millions

02:29:28
<transcript>: Let's look at let's look at what's different in this one.

02:29:28
<transcript>: there's a met

02:29:30
<transcript>: There's a meta stack. We don't need that anymore.

02:29:33
<transcript>: There's that stuff hosted zone.

02:29:36
<transcript>: It's the same.

02:29:42
<transcript>: So it's still not gonna, like, top level of weight. And that's a bummer.

02:29:42
<transcript>: i don't

02:29:45
<transcript>: I don't know what to think about that.

02:29:49
<transcript>: We have our TS config. It looks pretty similar to me.

02:29:53
<transcript>: And we're fine using toplevel weight over here.

02:30:00
<transcript>: You know. Oh, you know what node types? Maybe we need to match the node types because I don't think they're matching.

02:30:04
alexdev___: and what theme u use in nvim? :D

02:30:06
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:30:19
<transcript>: X? No tenteen? What.

02:30:23
<transcript>: That doesn't seem like late enough.

02:30:34
<transcript>: It types node 16.

02:30:37
<transcript>: Let's try this.

02:30:45
<transcript>: Let's go back.

02:30:57
<transcript>: What theme in this is the color scheme. Is Dracula. You can find all my dot files.

02:31:00
adamdotdev: !dotfiles

02:31:08
alexdev___: thx

02:31:10
<transcript>: Detox. Is that Dave.

02:31:10
<transcript>: dave

02:31:12
<transcript>: Dave, Dave Moore, is that you.

02:31:23
<transcript>: If it is. And you know why I thought it was you. If it's not, everyone else is confused. Well, everyone's confused anyway, no one really knows who date Morris, but.

02:31:23
detoxmango: who's Dave Moore?

02:31:24
<transcript>: Dave.

02:31:24
<transcript>: say you

02:31:28
<transcript>: Say you. I had a friend. Okay? Not day more than okay.

02:31:28
<transcript>: i have a friend

02:31:33
<transcript>: I have a friend, Dave, who will occasionally show up here in Chat. I thought maybe you renamed.

02:31:33
<transcript>: and just had

02:31:41
hideoo: That PlanetScale Boost thingy sounds pretty neat on the paper ^^

02:31:47
<transcript>: And just had a new username. But Dave has often told me about his trading strategies that are quite lucrative. And just the way you worded that just made me think maybe it was safe, that plan feel oh, Oh.

02:31:47
<transcript>: hi do

02:31:50
<transcript>: Hi, do they did they did they do it.

02:31:53
<transcript>: Did they do it.

02:31:54
hideoo: No Kappa

02:31:59
<transcript>: No oh Hi do.

02:32:03
<transcript>: On the paper? What do you mean on the paper.

02:32:06
<transcript>: On the paper.

hideoo: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221115005715/en/

02:32:19
<transcript>: Business wire.

02:32:22
<transcript>: Copy, link.

02:32:22
<transcript>: are you just

02:32:27
hideoo: They prolly announced it a bit early ^^

02:32:28
<transcript>: Are you just you use a word that I was not expecting? If it's not been announced? Oh, it has been announced? Wait.

02:32:28
<transcript>: business

02:32:33
<transcript>: Business Wire. So they put out a Press release. They just haven't announced it on Twitter yet.

02:32:36
<transcript>: Planet Scale boosts.

02:32:36
<transcript>: it

02:32:37
<transcript>: It's pretty incredible.

02:32:43
<transcript>: One of the two hardest problems in computer science. They've only got naming things left.

02:32:53
<transcript>: Probably announced it a bit early. Uhoh, well, let's just let's not talk about it until they say it on Twitter. I feel like if they haven't set it on Twitter, I don't want to talk about it.

02:32:54
hideoo: Even the link doesn't work yet

02:32:57
<transcript>: But it's pretty incredible, and I can't wait.

02:32:58
<transcript>: Okay.

02:32:58
<transcript>: now is it

02:33:04
<transcript>: Now is it working? Can we? So top level away now it's not happy up here.

02:33:10
<transcript>: Yes. Next we're system and the target options is twice 15 or higher.

02:33:14
blakegreendev: It doesn't exist if it's not on Twitter

02:33:20
<transcript>: I don't know if now that I've updated my node types, does that matters? Let's try.

02:33:22
<transcript>: Say, now.

02:33:29
<transcript>: Doesn't exist. It's not doesn't exist if it's not on Twitter. I agree. Even the link doesn't work yet.

02:33:29
<transcript>: oh they've

02:33:31
<transcript>: Oh, they've got a link in it.

02:33:35
<transcript>: Oh Oops.

02:33:42
<transcript>: What's happening? I've got a link in my buffer.

02:33:44
<transcript>: Okay, push the.

02:33:47
<transcript>: Yarn, build.

02:33:52
<transcript>: Okay, I got to figure out this top level await build issue.

02:33:56
<transcript>: It's an it's an issue.

02:33:59
<transcript>: Also from entries.

02:33:59
<transcript>: does not exist on

02:34:02
<transcript>: Does not exist on type object constructor.

02:34:02
<transcript>: oh i've got

02:34:04
<transcript>: Oh, I've got to use later you have to.

02:34:04
<transcript>: use later

02:34:07
<transcript>: Use later node types than that. Don't I.

02:34:12
<transcript>: Okay, that didn't fix it. So I'm gonna go back to the node 16.

02:34:14
<transcript>: Oh, I'm not.

02:34:24
<transcript>: So we gotta figure this out.

02:34:29
<transcript>: Top level away I've got it working in public Dev.

02:34:32
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:34:49
<transcript>: From entries.

02:34:54
<transcript>: Is from entries only available in.

02:34:58
<transcript>: Doesn't have an issue in here.

02:35:02
<transcript>: It was that not in that file.

02:35:02
<transcript>: that's the

02:35:04
<transcript>: That's the authorizer.

02:35:07
<transcript>: Not only available in Note 16.

02:35:07
<transcript>: no because

02:35:11
<transcript>: No because this works in 14. I've run this in public Dev for ever.

02:35:11
<transcript>: okay

02:35:12
<transcript>: Okay.

02:35:18
<transcript>: Let's see. Top level await. How are we gonna get it working.

02:35:21
bronifty: is a web api

02:35:25
<transcript>: How did I get it working in Public. Gov.

02:35:25
<transcript>: that's question

02:35:26
<transcript>: That's question.

02:35:30
bronifty: Nvmd

02:35:31
<transcript>: I build let's try building in public Dev.

02:35:45
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. It is a Web API. Yes. Also. Hi do welcome to chat.

02:35:51
<transcript>: And this doesn't build y.

02:35:51
hideoo: HeyGuys

02:35:55
<transcript>: Fail to bundle asset APS Act.

02:35:55
<transcript>: this

02:35:57
thdxr: are you sponsored by nike now?

02:35:57
<transcript>: This is very cryptic looking.

02:36:04
<transcript>: What.

02:36:08
<transcript>: Jeff generate bin path.

02:36:13
<transcript>: What.

02:36:15
<transcript>: Why is this all this.

02:36:15
<transcript>: you saw

02:36:19
<transcript>: You saw this build on another platform than the one you're currently using.

02:36:27
pantrakx: Hey

02:36:33
<transcript>: Word because the S build is written with native code and needs install platforms to binary. Specifically, the ISP. Darwin sees four packages present, but this platform needs Esfield Thorough and Arm 64.

02:36:34
thdxr: nuke node modules

02:36:36
thdxr: and reinstall

02:36:38
<transcript>: Get into the citrus by installing Es build on Windows or Mac OS and copying node modules.

02:36:38
<transcript>: into a docker

02:36:40
<transcript>: Into a Docker image.

02:36:42
<transcript>: What.

02:36:51
<transcript>: Okay. Let's just try.

02:36:55
<transcript>: That.

02:37:11
<transcript>: Everything's a lie. I can't build anything new modules and reinstall think stacks.

02:37:11
<transcript>: and my

02:37:22
<transcript>: And my sponsored by Nike. Nam. No. Can I wear a jacket that has a Nike logo on it, though? Is that okay? Is it bad till it? Do you have to actually specify you're not sponsored by something I feel like.

02:37:27
<transcript>: They should want people to wear their stuff. I don't know. Is that a thing.

02:37:35
<transcript>: Can I wear a logo on Twitch? Surely.

02:37:38
<transcript>: Oh, it actually built.

02:37:38
<transcript>: it actually

02:37:39
<transcript>: It actually built.

02:37:41
<transcript>: So why.

02:37:45
<transcript>: Why can I do top level wait.

02:37:45
<transcript>: here

02:37:47
<transcript>: Here.

02:37:53
<transcript>: In my authorizer? Or can I not there? What's this.

02:37:53
<transcript>: and sure type of

02:37:58
<transcript>: And sure type of handler can I be named? That a reference to Sentry service, mother.

02:37:58
<transcript>: okay

02:38:01
<transcript>: Okay, that's not the issue. That's not the top of a lowweight issue.

02:38:03
<transcript>: So.

02:38:07
thdxr: I joined at the right time

02:38:07
<transcript>: Act. I'm talking about things you would care about, like top level, away.

02:38:09
thdxr: what's the issue

02:38:10
<transcript>: Ts config.

02:38:11
thdxr: lol

02:38:15
<transcript>: Going to the right time. What's the issue? It's not working. It's working in this repo.

02:38:15
<transcript>: but

02:38:17
<transcript>: But over here.

02:38:23
wyteryce_: lol

02:38:24
<transcript>: I get an error with TypeScript top level wave expressions only allowing modules at the Es, next or system.

02:38:28
<transcript>: I can fix that one by just changing this to Es. Next.

02:38:29
<transcript>: That's fine.

02:38:32
<transcript>: But.

02:38:32
<transcript>: so that's

02:38:38
<transcript>: So that's that makes my editor happy when I actually run TypeScript. So I do yarn build.

02:38:45
<transcript>: A tax credit bombs I wonder if Touch gets not using my.

02:38:49
<transcript>: Yeah. So see that.

02:38:49
thdxr: is yarn build running esbuild?

02:38:51
thdxr: or typescript

02:38:56
<transcript>: Palpable expressions are only allowed when the module option is set to snex your system. It's like it's not using the right.

02:39:01
<transcript>: Node, Mailer.

02:39:04
pantrakx: Is this your vim configuration or you use a distro like spacevim?

02:39:07
<transcript>: Whoa, what? I don't want it doing all this type checking stuff on my.

02:39:11
<transcript>: Dependencies. Why is it doing that.

02:39:14
memph1s: maybe just use top lvl asyn for that?

02:39:17
<transcript>: Okay. I gotta figure that out, too.

02:39:21
<transcript>: But it's like it's not using the right tsconig.

02:39:21
<transcript>: it's like

02:39:23
<transcript>: It's like it's using the.

02:39:23
<transcript>: higher let's see

02:39:25
<transcript>: Higher. Let's see.

02:39:29
<transcript>: So if I go to my package JSON.

02:39:37
<transcript>: Fig.

02:39:40
<transcript>: When we do build up here.

02:39:42
<transcript>: You'll see.

02:39:45
baranoper: !dotfile

02:39:49
<transcript>: Is yarn build running es build or TypeScript it's running TypeScript.

02:39:50
baranoper: !dotfiles

02:39:50
fossabot: Adam's dotfiles live here: https://github.com/adamelmore/dotfiles The repository for bitter is here: https://github.com/adamelmore/bitter

02:39:59
<transcript>: As this your vim configuration or you use a distro like spacem. It's just straight neovem with a bunch of.

02:39:59
<transcript>: config stuff

02:40:00
<transcript>: Config stuff.

02:40:02
thdxr: how are the functions being built? there are esbuild specific options that need to be set

02:40:06
thdxr: if CDK is building the function

02:40:06
<transcript>: You guys were laughing at me. I don't know what I said. Maybe just use top level. Async for that.

02:40:19
<transcript>: How are the functions being built? There are espill specific options that need to be set. Is CDK is building a function? Yeah. You know what? I'm starting to wonder if I just don't do the TypeScript. Let me show you how it's being built.

02:40:19
<transcript>: so

02:40:22
<transcript>: So the function is actually defined here.

02:40:25
<transcript>: Authorized.

02:40:34
<transcript>: The magic buttons, so it's node 14.

02:40:34
<transcript>: i did this

02:40:36
<transcript>: I did this magical.

02:40:42
memph1s: (async()=> {})() something like that would work?

02:40:43
thdxr: I think it's missing one thing

02:40:49
<transcript>: This target node 14, eight output ASM I know I had to do that to get it to work when I did it in public. Dev. Oh, here's where I specify the TS config Lib functions. Tsconsig. Json.

02:40:54
<transcript>: Lib functions. Ts? Config JSON. That's right.

02:41:00
thdxr: target should be `esnext`

02:41:01
<transcript>: I think TypeScript actually is the thing that's throwing that maybe I just don't do TypeScript in my build.

02:41:01
<transcript>: i don't need to

02:41:04
<transcript>: I don't need to. I was just doing it for type checking.

02:41:06
<transcript>: But maybe I just don't.

02:41:06
<transcript>: i just

02:41:10
<transcript>: I just do a CDK sent. Let's see if it actually builds a CDK.

02:41:16
<transcript>: Missing one thing target should be yes next yes I updated.

02:41:16
<transcript>: target t

02:41:18
<transcript>: Target TS Max.

02:41:18
<transcript>: you're saying

02:41:21
<transcript>: You're saying Target in that file.

02:41:21
<transcript>: in the

02:41:23
<transcript>: In the CDK thing.

02:41:30
thdxr: yeah think I saw it said node14

02:41:33
<transcript>: Memphis, Memphis. I would still like to use top level Eight. I don't want to do any of that stuff. Okay, so it does. Cdk does.

02:41:34
<transcript>: packages

02:41:35
<transcript>: Packages? Just fine.

02:41:35
<transcript>: it's a typescript

02:41:37
<transcript>: It's a TypeScript thing.

02:41:37
<transcript>: and you're saying if

02:41:45
<transcript>: And you're saying if I go in here, well, that won't affect the TypeScript problem. But you're saying right here I should do target. Yes. Next, instead of node 14.

02:41:49
thdxr: yeah

02:41:50
stroopwafel26: ohai

02:41:52
<transcript>: Yeah, I think I saw it. Said Node 14. You're saying this should be.

02:41:57
stroopwafel26: dropping in for a few minutes

02:41:57
<transcript>: This should be es next. And if I do that kind of use node 16.

02:42:00
<transcript>: Because I couldn't use notesixing before.

02:42:03
thdxr: yeah use node16

02:42:06
<transcript>: Super dropping in for a few minutes. I Stroop.

02:42:06
<transcript>: yeah i use

02:42:10
<transcript>: Yeah, I use no. 16. Okay. Cool. So if I can use note 16.

02:42:10
<transcript>: that means

02:42:12
<transcript>: That means I also need to go.

02:42:14
<transcript>: Here.

02:42:14
<transcript>: and

02:42:16
<transcript>: And let's go.

02:42:19
stroopwafel26: hey adam, how's your day going?

02:42:23
<transcript>: Do that.

02:42:26
<transcript>: Types no. 16. Okay.

02:42:26
<transcript>: so then

02:42:30
<transcript>: So then should I put the I should put this back, I guess.

02:42:37
<transcript>: Okay.

02:42:37
<transcript>: so if it

02:42:41
<transcript>: So if it's not 16, it's arm.

02:42:45
<transcript>: It's ESM. There's my custom PS, config.

02:42:49
<transcript>: Node modules. Sequence manager. Next. Off. Yes. Next. Okay.

02:42:49
<transcript>: you're saying this

02:42:51
<transcript>: You're saying this should work.

02:42:54
<transcript>: Sand. This should work.

02:43:00
thdxr: that'll work when you run the function for real

02:43:00
<transcript>: I miss any steps.

02:43:03
<transcript>: It's going well. Stroop.

02:43:10
<transcript>: That'll work when you run the function for real. Yeah. The question is, can I get type checking to work.

02:43:12
<transcript>: The answer is no.

02:43:18
<transcript>: I'd like to be able to run type checking in my build. Do you run type checking.

02:43:18
<transcript>: do you

02:43:20
<transcript>: Do you do TSC.

02:43:20
thdxr: can I see your tsconfig again

02:43:22
thdxr: yeah I do

02:43:26
<transcript>: With no event just to see like if you've got issues, it's like checking everything. It's like going into my dependency, even.

02:43:26
<transcript>: you

02:43:29
<transcript>: You? Do you want to see my TS? Config.

02:43:29
<transcript>: good luck my

02:43:31
<transcript>: Good luck. My consensus of this.

02:43:31
<transcript>: there

02:43:35
<transcript>: There's two Tscon things. There's this top level TS. Config.

02:43:37
<transcript>: Right.

02:43:37
<transcript>: that's like

02:43:40
<transcript>: That's like for my CDK project.

02:43:40
<transcript>: do you wanna see that one

02:43:41
<transcript>: Do you wanna see that one.

02:43:45
<transcript>: Do you want to see the TS config in my Functions directory.

02:43:52
thdxr: the one for func dir

02:43:58
<transcript>: The one for the function director. Here it is.

02:44:00
<transcript>: Good luck.

02:44:02
<transcript>: Bad speed.

02:44:02
thdxr: and you need compilerOptions.skipLibCheck = true to skip the dep checks

02:44:04
stroopwafel26: cool hat btw

02:44:06
<transcript>: I hate all of this. I hate all this stuff.

02:44:09
thdxr: omg why is there so much

02:44:10
<transcript>: Cool hat. Thanks.

02:44:10
<transcript>: david sherpa

02:44:12
<transcript>: David Sherpa thanks so much for the follow.

02:44:12
<transcript>: why is there

02:44:15
<transcript>: Why is there so much? That's what I say, DAX, why is there so much.

02:44:20
<transcript>: Can I just make this a lot simpler? Tell me what to do next.

02:44:22
thdxr: yeah

02:44:23
<transcript>: Do you want to take over my screen? That'd be great.

02:44:32
<transcript>: Yeah. How do we make this simpler? Just give me one to copy and paste. I'll just copy and paste it.

02:44:33
memph1s: most of them probably default values?

02:44:37
<transcript>: Like a note 16 one I think I've seen.

02:44:39
<transcript>: Probably our default.

02:44:45
<transcript>: Type roots. I don't know if I have to do it any of that. Honestly, I just have no idea.

02:44:50
<transcript>: What I want is I want I want to delete all of this.

02:44:53
thdxr: you can install `@tsconfig/node14`

02:44:55
<transcript>: I want DAX to give me one Gimme.

02:44:55
<transcript>: this

02:44:59
<transcript>: This can say ignored. Forteen? Are you serious.

02:45:03
<transcript>: Are you kidding me right now? I can just do this.

02:45:03
<transcript>: yarn

02:45:03
thdxr: er node16

02:45:04
<transcript>: Yarn.

02:45:04
<transcript>: add

02:45:05
<transcript>: Add.

02:45:08
<transcript>: Foot Note 14.

02:45:08
<transcript>: or note sixteen

02:45:10
<transcript>: Or Note 16. Oops.

02:45:20
<transcript>: So got no. 16 now.

02:45:20
<transcript>: and

02:45:26
<transcript>: And I can just do, like, base or something. I can say, like, derive from that thing.

02:45:31
<transcript>: I want to be patient, but I'm just gonna look and see what I did here. Extends.

02:45:31
<transcript>: and

02:45:33
<transcript>: And I can just do this.

02:45:34
mattmancodes: extends

02:45:37
thdxr: and then you can do { "extends": "@tsconfig/node16/tsconfig.json }

02:45:41
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:45:41
<transcript>: ts

02:45:45
<transcript>: Ts. Config nodes 16.

02:45:46
thdxr: and then the only option you need is compilerOptions.module = esnext

02:45:47
data_sherpa: I always feel so lost watching dev streams, but also so infatuated by it all.

02:45:48
<transcript>: Psconfig JSON.

02:45:51
<transcript>: Now I can get rid of all this nonsense.

02:45:55
<transcript>: I can just say include and exclude.

02:45:55
<transcript>: cool

02:45:57
<transcript>: Cool.

02:45:57
<transcript>: ada sherpa

02:46:03
<transcript>: Ada. Sherpa welcome to Chat. I always feel so lost watching Dead Streams but also so infuriated by all.

02:46:03
<transcript>: i'm sorry

02:46:04
<transcript>: I'm sorry.

02:46:04
<transcript>: i'm sorry

02:46:05
<transcript>: I'm sorry.

02:46:05
<transcript>: and then only

02:46:10
thdxr: compilerOptions.skipLibCheck = true

02:46:10
<transcript>: And then only the only option you need is module Es next. So I do need to do.

02:46:13
<transcript>: Compiler.

02:46:14
data_sherpa: infatuated, not infuriated, lol

02:46:15
<transcript>: Options.

02:46:25
<transcript>: Thanks so much for follow the code of Lime. What was it? Module.

02:46:29
<transcript>: Yes. Next. And then I need to say.

02:46:29
<transcript>: compiler

02:46:32
<transcript>: Compiler options. Skip.

02:46:34
<transcript>: Libcheck.

02:46:34
<transcript>: oh

02:46:35
<transcript>: Oh.

02:46:37
<transcript>: Lib check.

02:46:37
<transcript>: true

02:46:38
<transcript>: True.

02:46:45
<transcript>: Infatuated noted. Okay that makes way more sense. Data.

02:46:50
<transcript>: I was like man, I'm sorry I don't want to intru ate you.

02:46:50
<transcript>: okay

02:46:53
<transcript>: Okay. So here it is.

02:46:53
<transcript>: compiler

02:46:54
thdxr: you might also need     "moduleResolution": "node",  I don't remember

02:46:57
<transcript>: Compiler options modules get next. So this should be a little simpler.

02:46:59
<transcript>: See if this works.

02:47:05
<transcript>: I also need module resolution node.

02:47:05
<transcript>: well

02:47:07
<transcript>: Well, let's try.

02:47:19
<transcript>: It be really funny to me if we slowly add it back all of the things that we're in there.

02:47:22
<transcript>: Every single line.

02:47:22
<transcript>: like oh you might also

02:47:25
thdxr: lol

02:47:27
<transcript>: Like, oh, you might also need no emit? Oh, also you might need.

02:47:31
<transcript>: Whatever all those other ones were.

02:47:35
thdxr: and are you running tsc inside the functions directory?

02:47:40
<transcript>: So this is now an issue. Lsp restart, but let's see if PSD works now, because I can get around that somehow.

02:47:40
<transcript>: do i

02:47:42
<transcript>: Do I need to do target.

02:47:42
<transcript>: five modules

02:47:47
<transcript>: Five modules to ESNEXT so I need target to be DS 2018 or something.

02:47:51
<transcript>: I'm running, TSC.

02:47:51
<transcript>: inside

02:47:52
<transcript>: Inside.

02:47:52
<transcript>: the ap

02:47:56
<transcript>: The API, the top level directory, like the CDK root.

02:47:58
<transcript>: Yarn.

02:48:00
<transcript>: Build.

02:48:06
thdxr: is that supposed to work? I always run tsc in the subpackages

02:48:16
<transcript>: I'm not running it inside the functions directory. Should I be? Is that why you do what you do? Oh, that's why you do, isn't it? That's why you do what you do in SS T. That's supposed to work. I always run Tse in the subpackages, so I don't put my functions in a subpackion package.

02:48:22
<transcript>: Should I. It works in public. Why does it work in public? Dev.

02:48:23
thdxr: I put all backend code in a subpackage

02:48:25
<transcript>: I just have a function directory.

02:48:29
<transcript>: It all back in code in a subpackage.

02:48:33
<transcript>: What is backend? Code.

02:48:35
<transcript>: Backend code.

02:48:40
<transcript>: Like the whole CDK app is back in code, right.

02:48:44
<transcript>: Or you're saying all the Lambda code like all the function code.

02:48:52
<transcript>: That makes sense.

02:48:52
thdxr: yeah it doesn't have to be a real pacakge

02:48:59
thdxr: just a subfolder with its own tsconfig and I run tsc in there

02:49:01
<transcript>: So I just need to do that. Doesn't have to be a real package. Okay, so let's I'm gonna make it another turbo repo package.

02:49:05
<transcript>: Some folder with Zon TS convegan. I run Tse in there.

02:49:11
<transcript>: Okay. So you're saying if I just run TSC in there maybe that'll fix it.

02:49:23
<transcript>: Okay. I didn't mean to do that. I don't know how to clear the filter.

02:49:26
thdxr: yeah I use turbo repo to run tsc in parallel in functions, in frontend, etc

02:49:28
<transcript>: All right.

02:49:33
<transcript>: Hello.

02:49:37
<transcript>: Let's go in there, package JSON. Let's say, Tse.

02:49:40
thdxr: are you still getting the top level await error in editor?

02:49:52
<transcript>: Or pop D.

02:49:56
<transcript>: Lib, functions.

02:49:58
<transcript>: And Tse.

02:50:02
<transcript>: And pop B? Oh, I didn't push the.

02:50:19
<transcript>: Ran TSC just in the functions director. You're saying that still doesn't work.

02:50:22
<transcript>: So that's to target.

02:50:22
<transcript>: we'll see target

02:50:23
<transcript>: We'll see target.

02:50:34
<transcript>: Like that.

02:50:51
<transcript>: Okay. I use turbo repo to run Tse in parallel and functions in front and etc.

02:50:51
<transcript>: yeah

02:51:02
<transcript>: Yeah. Are you still getting the top of a waiter and editor? We'll check. Oh, what's the saying now? Argument for Target must be yes, 13. Oh, oh, this is a capital yes, 2018 matter.

02:51:09
<transcript>: It could be okay. Well, let's hope that's it.

02:51:13
thdxr: I have es2017 in mine

02:51:19
<transcript>: Do I not have a comma? I might not have had a comma. Yes. 2017 in years.

02:51:22
<transcript>: Look at all this. Everything's so broken.

02:51:25
<transcript>: 2018.

02:51:28
<transcript>: What.

02:51:30
<transcript>: Wait.

02:51:34
<transcript>: This is actually errors inside of my.

02:51:37
<transcript>: Like Skip lube check didn't work.

02:51:42
<transcript>: This is like in the TS config package. You see that.

02:51:49
thdxr: what version of typescript is this

02:51:49
<transcript>: I love how much time I spend not doing the thing I want to do.

02:51:53
<transcript>: I don't actually love it. I hate that.

02:51:58
<transcript>: What version of TypeScript is this.

02:51:58
<transcript>: geez

02:51:59
brizzz_: TIL: pushd and popd

02:52:03
<transcript>: Geez, I don't know. Probably an old one. It's whatever the CDK uses.

02:52:05
<transcript>: Here.

02:52:11
<transcript>: That's your. Three, nine, seven.

02:52:14
<transcript>: What do you use.

02:52:18
thdxr: 3.9 is wayyy too old

02:52:21
<transcript>: Briz. Today you learn push, Dean Pop D. I could teach you something today.

02:52:21
<transcript>: three nine

02:52:27
<transcript>: Three, nine is way too old. Okay, well, stupid CDK. Why do they do it.

02:52:27
<transcript>: what

02:52:29
<transcript>: What should it be.

02:52:31
thdxr: that's why it's not understanding @tsconfig/node16/config

02:52:33
<transcript>: Give me something. Dax.

02:52:36
memph1s: 4.7.4 mine

02:52:36
<transcript>: Okay.

02:52:36
thdxr: idk use latest? haha

02:52:39
<transcript>: Three, nine, no good.

02:52:42
<transcript>: Just latest.

02:52:45
<transcript>: That's safe.

02:52:46
thdxr: mine is 4.7.4 also

02:52:48
<transcript>: Yarn install.

02:52:48
<transcript>: try it

02:52:51
<transcript>: Try it. We'll try the latest type script.

02:53:04
<transcript>: Okay, new output.

02:53:07
memph1s: 4.8.4 latest

02:53:08
<transcript>: Still doesn't like toplevel await.

02:53:08
<transcript>: still

02:53:12
<transcript>: Still looking inside of my node modules. Why is it doing that.

02:53:24
<transcript>: I just need to use SST.

02:53:24
<transcript>: i just need to use

02:53:25
thdxr: you need the cd back in there probably

02:53:29
<transcript>: I just need to use SSD and forget about my VTL resolvers and all this nonsense.

02:53:29
<transcript>: cd

02:53:30
thdxr: yeah lol

02:53:31
<transcript>: Cd back in there.

02:53:33
<transcript>: Okay.

02:53:37
thdxr: you can keep your VTL in sst

02:53:45
<transcript>: You need the CD back in there. I sound like a bummer to have that in my butt, but I'm just not gonna do TSD. I don't even care anymore. I just. It's not. It's gonna work at runtime.

02:53:51
<transcript>: So. Like, I'm not typing. I'm not doing it, not doing it.

02:53:54
<transcript>: I'll get whatever support my editor gives me.

02:53:59
<transcript>: So let's go back into Jeez. It's actually admitting.

02:54:01
blakegreendev: use the latest release of Deno ;)

02:54:05
<transcript>: Oh, that's a bummer hate. That.

02:54:16
<transcript>: This is working now so type level tuffle bowl awaits working in here.

02:54:16
<transcript>: i

02:54:20
<transcript>: I editor. So that's good. Now it's yarn, build.

02:54:20
<transcript>: oh

02:54:22
<transcript>: Oh, my goodness.

02:54:31
<transcript>: You can keep your VTL and SST. I can still use VTL and SSD.

02:54:35
<transcript>: I should be using it right now, then.

02:54:38
<transcript>: So I came over here because I just wanted to say.

02:54:39
<transcript>: Typescript.

02:54:42
<transcript>: And ESA.

02:54:47
<transcript>: And node. It's all broken.

02:54:47
<transcript>: am

02:54:49
<transcript>: Am I wrong? Or is it all broken.

02:54:52
<transcript>: Use the latest release of Den out.

02:54:58
<transcript>: There's an idea. Maybe I should just be using denh. Then I'd have all new problems.

02:55:03
mattmancodes: 100% correct

02:55:03
<transcript>: Is it broken back or in my broken.

02:55:06
spartangtr: dee-no?

02:55:08
sirchancey: don't use TS Kappa

02:55:14
thdxr: all the new stuff in the node ecosystem is good but no one knows how to use it so all the deps are broken

02:55:17
<transcript>: Like the reason the only reason I had that specific version of TypeScript in there is that's when you do create CDK app, that's what they use. Don't use TypeScript. Well, that's a whole nother group of problems then.

02:55:18
spartangtr: @SirChancey dont use anything javascript

02:55:24
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat, Sir Chantsy All the new stuff in the Node ecosystem is good, but no one knows how to use it. So all the depths are broken? Yeah.

02:55:25
stroopwafel26: Company I work for decided to use CDK TypeScript and I fucking hate it sorry for swearing but I have a lot of feelings on this topic

02:55:25
thdxr: AWS SDK v3 is STILL not packaged correctly

02:55:27
<transcript>: I feel like.

02:55:27
<transcript>: feel like there's some

02:55:29
<transcript>: Feel like there's some broken stuff.

02:55:34
<transcript>: Yeah, even version three of the SDKs correctly. Come on, people.

02:55:43
<transcript>: A company I work for decided to use CDK TypeScript and I fucking hate it. Sorry for swearing, but I have a lot of feelings on this topic. I'm sorry for swearing by reading or swearing.

02:55:43
<transcript>: for

02:55:45
<transcript>: For anyone offended.

02:55:49
<transcript>: Still not packing correctly.

<transcript>: So if Amazon can't even get it right.

02:55:54
<transcript>: So hope for any of us.

02:56:00
thdxr: no we're all screwed

02:56:03
<transcript>: This whole ecosystem. It does. It makes me want to just go to PHP. It honestly makes me just want to, like, forget all of it.

02:56:03
oskrm: hello, am i late?

02:56:10
<transcript>: I'm having another larvae.

02:56:10
<transcript>: that's how stress

stroopwafel26: No TypeScript is doomed and will hopefully burn in a few years

02:56:13
wyteryce_: abandon all hope ye who enter

02:56:14
<transcript>: That's how stressed I am. Oscar, you didn't miss anything.

02:56:32
cchambers75: just go back to rust! lol

02:56:34
<transcript>: We're all screwed type script is doomed and we'll hopefully burn in a few years. Abandon all hope Yeho enter what's the answer? What's the answer for all this nonsense? Like I I want to work on my stupid AW guessing game. Aws guessing game and all I've done today is mess with editor TS config Esli.

02:56:34
<transcript>: eslince all

02:56:39

02:56:40
oskrm: abandon humanity, go monkey LUL

02:56:53
<transcript>: Go monkey.

02:56:56
<transcript>: That's funny.

02:57:00
stroopwafel26: Rust is just a different can of worms

02:57:00
thdxr: you had the answer already, use SST and blindly follow our folder structure

02:57:03
<transcript>: That's. When do I get to use SST version Two? I feel like you've solved all this.

02:57:07
memph1s: i was using alternative of typescript created by facebook

02:57:10
<transcript>: I want to DAX, I want to blindly follow your folder, structure.

02:57:14

<transcript>: It's been a rough start, but I know what we're gonna do now.

02:57:36

stroopwafel26: sorry for swearing in your chat, didn't mean to

02:58:31
<transcript>: Console. Here's what we're doing right now.

02:58:36
<transcript>: I want to just redirect a domain.

<transcript>: somewhere

02:58:37
<transcript>: Somewhere.

02:58:41

<transcript>: right here

02:58:45
stroopwafel26: I have to get my anger in check but you know that already

02:58:48
<transcript>: Right here. So I've got this domain in Route 53. If I want to redirect this to my Twitch.

02:58:52
stroopwafel26: thdxr k bye

<transcript>: Did I do this on screen? No. I was gonna do this YouTube video, and then I didn't.

02:59:26
thdxr: everything is so simple

02:59:33
<transcript>: So I redid my atom Dev, but I want to make Adam of that TV. Just point to my Twitch for now.

02:59:41
<transcript>: What's the best way to do that? Do I have to, like, deploy a whole thing, like a whole cloud front distribution to do just a stupid redirect? Do I have to do that back? So I have to do that.

02:59:48
<transcript>: Oh, Astro is the best. Dax. Love it so much. It's so simple.

02:59:49
thdxr: yeah it SUCKS

02:59:51

<transcript>: Just want to do a redirect going to pay for it.

03:00:57
thdxr: no it's free

03:00:58
<transcript>: Easy to use DNS.

03:01:03
<transcript>: Three page rules. I feel like this is gonna work for me.

03:01:08
<transcript>: I'd did pay for the pro on Adam Dev. I don't know if I even needed it.

03:01:08
<transcript>: okay add

03:01:09
thdxr: yeah you need a page rule

03:01:11
<transcript>: Okay, add more DNS Records for Adam TV.

03:01:11
<transcript>: i need

03:01:14
oskrm: @stroopwafel26 On one point they provide cool stuff, on the other side, they are gaining too much control

03:01:15
<transcript>: I need to actually move it over to cloud player, right.

03:01:21
<transcript>: Need a page rule.

03:01:27
stroopwafel26: @stroopwafel26 exactly

03:01:28
oskrm: the 'ol put the free plan at the very end trick

03:01:29
<transcript>: A little freezie start making their blog in Astro this is an Astro Appreciation stream.

03:01:34
<transcript>: The old put the free plants are very Intric. Yeah.

03:01:34
<transcript>: okay

03:01:37
stroopwafel26: Thanks Astro!

03:01:39
<transcript>: Okay. So do I need to add more DNS records? I just need to actually.

03:01:42
thdxr: Astro + cloudflare was so easy

03:01:42
<transcript>: Let's just continue. I'm not gonna do that. Add later.

03:01:47
<transcript>: Unable to activate your site or what do I need to add here? So what is it saying.

03:01:54
thdxr: and I'm saying that as someone really tied to the AWS ecosystem

03:01:58
<transcript>: Add more records. I don't. I have nothing to point it to. Yeah, Astro Plus Cloud Player. That's exactly what I did with Adam Dev.

03:02:01
oskrm: just add a random to 127.0.0.1

03:02:01
stroopwafel26: paid plan starts at only 20$, super super cheap

03:02:04
<transcript>: And also I'm also really tied to the Aubis ecosystem, but yeah, love it.

03:02:13
<transcript>: Okay. I don't. Yeah, I don't need. I don't have anything to add there. I just need to move my name servers over.

03:02:13
<transcript>: right

03:02:14
<transcript>: Right.

03:02:17
<transcript>: From Namecheap.

03:02:28
<transcript>: This is refreshing. This is something I want to actually do, and it doesn't involve TypeScript. Feels good.

03:02:33
<transcript>: Manage.

03:02:35
stroopwafel26: yubikey fam

03:02:37
<transcript>: Name, servers.

03:02:42
<transcript>: Okay.

03:02:42
<transcript>: and then

03:02:44
<transcript>: And then this one.

03:02:48
thdxr: I need to get a second yubikey

03:02:51
<transcript>: Hey, DAX, have you ever felt like cloud floor? Dns is slow.

03:02:53
<transcript>: Or something.

03:02:53
stroopwafel26: me too

03:02:58
<transcript>: Do you feel like that as somebody who's used to quite like if you're more used to Route 53.

03:02:58
<transcript>: are you

03:03:01
<transcript>: Are you? Do you feel like.

03:03:01
<transcript>: cloud

03:03:04
<transcript>: Cloudflare DNS is not as snappy.

03:03:04
thdxr: I always thought cloudflare DNS was too fast

03:03:06
<transcript>: Or am I just imagining that.

03:03:10
<transcript>: I could be imagining it.

03:03:10
thdxr: so idk

03:03:12
oskrm: nope, its super fast for me

03:03:13
<transcript>: But I've done a lot of DNS work in my career.

03:03:13
<transcript>: i always thought cloud

03:03:17
<transcript>: I always thought cloud Floor DNS was too fast. What.

03:03:17
<transcript>: everyone says

03:03:21
<transcript>: Everyone says, Is it super fast? I've had such flakiness with DNS here.

03:03:24
<transcript>: Automatic http. Sure.

03:03:27
<transcript>: Always use https Yep.

03:03:31
<transcript>: Nope.

03:03:35
stroopwafel26: @thdxr disable the turbo button on your ibm pc

03:03:36
<transcript>: Sure, I'm not gonna actually serve any pages right now. Finish.

03:03:39
<transcript>: Trick names are.

03:03:45
oskrm: ibm pc LUL

03:03:52
memph1s: :D

03:03:52
<transcript>: Disabled the Turbo button on your IBM PC.

03:03:57
<transcript>: Okay. We want to.

03:04:01
<transcript>: Pedro, I'm gonna add a page rule.

03:04:08
memph1s: api keys PogChamp

03:04:08
<transcript>: I'm just gonna say.

03:04:10
<transcript>: Everything right.

03:04:16
<transcript>: Then I'm.

03:04:21
<transcript>: Forwarding URL.

03:04:21
<transcript>: probably

03:04:22
<transcript>: Probably.

03:04:26
<transcript>: Permanent redirect.

03:04:26
<transcript>: it's

03:04:28
<transcript>: It's a turn. It's a permanent right.

03:04:36
<transcript>: Adam Dev.

03:04:37
thdxr: permanent gets cached so maybe do 302

03:04:39
<transcript>: Is that actually.

03:04:48
<transcript>: Www. So I want to just get it right the first time. No additional redirection.

03:04:52
<transcript>: Ww. Twist TV. Adam Dev.

03:04:55
<transcript>: Save and deploy.

03:04:55
<transcript>: oh

03:05:00
<transcript>: Oh, she referenced the domain Adam TV. So if I say Adam TV.

03:05:05
thdxr: put the domain then /*

03:05:06
<transcript>: Anything. Adam. Tv. That.

03:05:07
oskrm: what are the chances that you will update adamdotdev?

03:05:07
thdxr: I think

03:05:11
<transcript>: My dumb. Is this not the way to do it? Okay. It worked.

03:05:18
<transcript>: Okay. Overview. Let's see if the name servers are good. Now.

03:05:21
<transcript>: Already being rechecked.

03:05:24
<transcript>: I don't have a text record in there.

03:05:25
<transcript>: What.

03:05:35
thdxr: I wonder how this works when you don't have any dns records

03:05:37
thdxr: I hope it works!

03:05:41
<transcript>: Are the chances that you will update Adam Dev.

03:05:47
<transcript>: Oh permanent gets cash so maybe do 302.

03:05:49
<transcript>: Call.

03:05:49
<transcript>: i might

03:05:54
<transcript>: I might ever I might actually want to do something on the site eventually, right? Yeah.

03:05:58
<transcript>: Change Page rules. Edit.

03:06:17
<transcript>: Okay. So it's updating. We're getting there. Is it just working now? Adam. Tv? Nope.

03:06:34
<transcript>: Did I miss a step here? I've replaced. Okay. Logan, to your register. Yep. Replace them? Yep. It's still just propagating. Maybe it's Namecheap.

03:06:35
cowfacedude99: so you paid the premium? LUL

03:06:41
<transcript>: Maybe namechiefs the slow thing. What? I wonder how this works when you don't have any DNS records.

03:06:47
<transcript>: So you paid the premium calf face we met in the middle.

03:06:47
<transcript>: for

03:06:50
<transcript>: For those who've been following along, we met in the middle.

03:06:50
<transcript>: on negotia

03:06:52
<transcript>: On negotiations.

03:06:52
<transcript>: so not the

03:06:56
<transcript>: So not the premium, but also not the original stated price.

03:07:10
<transcript>: So I want to thank my employer, my cofounder, for the domain. Thank you so much, Eli. He's not probably here right now, but if he is, thank you, Eli.

03:07:15
<transcript>: Let's see. Hope it works. Is there a pressure here? Okay, I can't keep reading.

03:07:21
<transcript>: But I also don't think not yet active on Cloudflare so I can't.

03:07:24
<transcript>: I have to actually add DNS records. What would I add.

03:07:24
<transcript>: like

03:07:26
<transcript>: Like what would I put here.

03:07:29
<transcript>: I mean I could.

03:07:34
<transcript>: Let's put a bogus text record. I don't know.

03:07:37
<transcript>: Text record.

03:07:39
<transcript>: Root.

03:07:41
oskrm: oskr.adam.tv -> 127.0.0.1 :P

03:07:42
thdxr: it'll probably work since cf is magic

03:07:43
<transcript>: Kind of what's here.

03:07:54
<transcript>: What am I supposed to do? It'll probably work since classifier is magic. Oscar Adam TV goes to 127. Does ears here.

03:07:57
stroopwafel26: magic.gif

03:08:03
thdxr: CF = cloudflare, cloudfront, cloudformation?

03:08:08
<transcript>: Yeah, I get the like, it doesn't know what to do if there's no records, but like also, what would I put in there? I don't want to point Atom TV's a record somewhere. I just I've got a top level page rule.

03:08:10
oskrm: https://c.oskr.nl/magic.gif

03:08:10
<transcript>: And.

03:08:10
<transcript>: do i need

03:08:15
<transcript>: Do I need to actually host this on cloudflower pages? Like just a bogus page or something.

03:08:21
<transcript>: Anybody know like I wonder if it can't work unless.

03:08:21
<transcript>: there's

03:08:22
thdxr: it should all just work

03:08:26
<transcript>: There's a legitimate a record pointing at something should all just work.

03:08:31
thdxr: we'll see

03:08:31
oskrm: ;; ANSWER SECTION: adam.tv. 0 IN TXT "adam wuz here"

03:08:35
<transcript>: See if cloud Flare cloud Front Collaboration Yeah, I use CFN for CloudFormation, and I usually say CF for cloud front, but now it could be cloud flare.

03:08:37
<transcript>: Answer section.

03:08:39
oskrm: the txt updated

03:08:41
stroopwafel26: @oskrM that's very different from what I expected

03:08:51
<transcript>: So the names the names name server records are pointing correctly all over the globe.

03:08:53
<transcript>: So that's not the problem.

03:09:04
thdxr: the problem is your tsconfig

03:09:05
<transcript>: What's the problem? You guys keep saying, cloud flare, so snappy for you. I feel like this has been my experience. I make a change and then, like, later in the day, I check and, oh, it worked, but it doesn't ever work. The moment I do it.

03:09:05
<transcript>: perch

03:09:08
<transcript>: Perch, Cache DNS, settings.

03:09:08
stroopwafel26: lol

03:09:09
memph1s: :D

03:09:16
<transcript>: Pause cloud flare on site.

03:09:19
<transcript>: What do we think.

03:09:19
<transcript>: oh it's now it's not

03:09:22
<transcript>: Oh, it's now. It's not protecting my site.

03:09:26
<transcript>: Is the page rule working.

03:09:33
<transcript>: Oh.

03:09:39
<transcript>: That TV, fail.

03:09:42
oskrm: redo the rule?

03:09:44
<transcript>: Problem is your TS? Config. Oh, my word.

03:09:44
<transcript>: don't even

03:09:48
thdxr: maybe point the apex to adam.dev and the page rule should overwrite it

03:09:48
<transcript>: Don't even come at me with TS config redo the rule. Yeah, we could try that.

03:09:48
<transcript>: ugh

03:09:50
oskrm: with just adam.tv/*

03:09:51
cowfacedude99: you should come back after a while.

03:09:54
<transcript>: Ugh it probably is CS config somewhere that's probably the issue. Purge cash.

03:10:03
<transcript>: Level browser Cash TTL.

03:10:03
<transcript>: crawler

03:10:05
<transcript>: Crawler. Hints. Always online.

03:10:08
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:10:08
<transcript>: dns

03:10:09
<transcript>: Dns.

03:10:09
<transcript>: ca

03:10:11
<transcript>: Cache rules.

03:10:14
<transcript>: These are the Page Rules, right? Yeah.

03:10:23
<transcript>: Oh, I don't want the slash just like that.

03:10:25
stroopwafel26: How would my browser know where to go without DNS records? Is CF inserting a DNS record when I create a page rule? Think not

03:10:25
<transcript>: We're going there.

03:10:30
<transcript>: Did I not update it.

03:10:34
<transcript>: Still shows the slash.

03:10:40
<transcript>: Do that.

03:10:59
thdxr: in cloudfront you can add a @ cname record (which works on cf) that points to adam.dev and the page rule should then work

03:10:59
oskrm: remove the first *?

03:11:00
<transcript>: Redirect. Rules. Oh oh. Create static. Redux. Okay.

03:11:03
<transcript>: Is this different than a page.

03:11:03
<transcript>: bulk

03:11:06
<transcript>: Bulk redirects. So single redirects.

03:11:06
<transcript>: source

03:11:09
<transcript>: Source URL to a target URL.

03:11:10
<transcript>: And.

03:11:11
thdxr: oh nice I didn't know baout redirect rules

03:11:13
<transcript>: Normalize at the edge.

03:11:17
<transcript>: Adam TV, what am I, one of my search engine.

03:11:22
<transcript>: Great reader. Here we go. Rule name default.

03:11:27
<transcript>: Incoming requests.

03:11:30
<transcript>: Match anything.

03:11:32
<transcript>: Then.

03:11:36
<transcript>: Static.

03:11:38
<transcript>: We're gonna do 302.

03:11:38
<transcript>: go

03:11:44
<transcript>: Go to www. Twitch. Tv Adam Dev.

03:11:47
<transcript>: How do I just say anything.

03:11:51
<transcript>: When.

03:11:56
<transcript>: Just deploy. I'm just not even gonna put anything, okay? I have to do a valid expression.

03:11:59
<transcript>: Let's say.

03:11:59
<transcript>: hostname

03:12:01
<transcript>: Hostname? No.

03:12:03
<transcript>: Uri.

03:12:06
stroopwafel26: From a random dude; The first thing you will need is a DNS record for @, www and any other subdomains you want to redirect, set to :orange:. This can point to any IP address as the redirection page rule will execute first. I would recommend pointing them to 192.0.2.1 , a dummy IP.

03:12:12
<transcript>: Would be.

03:12:12
<transcript>: i'm not

03:12:14
<transcript>: I'm not TV, right.

03:12:16
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:12:16
<transcript>: so

03:12:17
thdxr: ^

03:12:20
<transcript>: So this is better than a page rule, I guess.

03:12:27
memph1s: you can add A and CNAME records for 192.0.2.1

03:12:28
<transcript>: Okay. Let's try that.

03:12:29
thdxr: you need to turn on the cloudflare cloud icon thing on the record also

03:12:35
stroopwafel26: yeah

03:12:36
<transcript>: You can add A and CNAME records for.

03:12:41
stroopwafel26: it needs to be an orange icon

03:12:45
<transcript>: You can add an at CNAME record which works on cloud front that points that out of the Dev and the page rule should then work.

03:12:51
<transcript>: Maybe point to apex. Am not Dev and the page rule should override it.

03:12:58
<transcript>: What do we think? Do we think the Redirects. You should come back after a while. Maybe we'll just come back to this.

03:12:58
<transcript>: how do you

03:13:09
<transcript>: How do you have my browser know when to go with DNS records is cloud for inserting a DNS record when I create a page rule, think not in cloud front you can add an at CNAME record.

03:13:09
<transcript>: that points

03:13:10
thdxr: you'll always need a record because right now the dns doesn't point anywhere

03:13:13
oskrm: yeah maybe add @ -> adam.dev with orange icon

03:13:15
<transcript>: That points to add Dev and the page will work. Remove the first star. Oh nice. I didn't know about redirect.

03:13:15
<transcript>: the first thing

03:13:18
thdxr: I meant cloudflare lol

03:13:26
<transcript>: The first thing you will need is a DNS record for at WW in any other subdomain you want to redirect set to Orange. This can point to any IP addresses. The redirection page rule will execute first.

03:13:28
<transcript>: Okay.

03:13:28
<transcript>: you can add an

03:13:35
<transcript>: You can add an AC name, but do we think now it needs to be an Orange icon? What? What are we talking about.

03:13:40
<transcript>: You turn on the class flare cloud icon thing on the record also.

03:13:44
oskrm: orange means cloudflare proxy

03:13:47
<transcript>: You'll always need a record, because right now, the DNS is a point anywhere. Okay. Okay, we're doing it.

03:13:50
<transcript>: We'll do it.

03:13:51
stroopwafel26: Go into DNS settings, you'll see the cloud icons, now grey

03:13:52
<transcript>: We'll go to DNS.

03:13:56
<transcript>: I did a text record, but you're saying I need to add.

03:14:04
<transcript>: Yeah, I need to do the proxy status. You're saying.

03:14:04
<transcript>: maybe

03:14:07
<transcript>: Maybe add app to Adamant Dev.

03:14:08
stroopwafel26: proxy status enabled yeah

03:14:10
<transcript>: So that would be a C name, right.

03:14:12
<transcript>: Oh.

03:14:19
<transcript>: Adam Dev proxied.

03:14:21
<transcript>: Save I'm gonna delete.

03:14:21
<transcript>: the

03:14:23
<transcript>: The text record.

03:14:28
<transcript>: Okay. You're saying this should work.

03:14:32
<transcript>: Okay.

03:14:32
<transcript>: cloud

03:14:35
stroopwafel26: also do A

03:14:35
<transcript>: Cloud Flare Proxy done.

03:14:37
thdxr: I'll tell you when I see the updated record here

03:14:39
memph1s: 192.0.2.ye it works1

03:14:41
<transcript>: But I don't need an a record just to see name should work.

03:14:49
thdxr: cloudflare generates an A record automatically

03:14:49
<transcript>: Okay, now let's go back to our I turned off our page rule, right.

03:14:49
<transcript>: yeah

03:14:51
thdxr: for an apex cname

03:14:54
<transcript>: Yeah. Page rules turned off. Instead, we're using redirect rules.

03:14:54
memph1s: works fine

03:14:56
stroopwafel26: @ A 127.0.0.1

03:14:58
<transcript>: I guess that's better than I don't know is that better.

03:15:07
memph1s: ye just go adam.tv redirects

03:15:07
<transcript>: You say I need to do a dummy a record to.

03:15:10
<transcript>: Do that.

03:15:15
thdxr: looks like it's working for some people

03:15:16
<transcript>: We'll do a dummy, a record.

03:15:18
<transcript>: A.

03:15:21
thdxr: not yet for me

03:15:22
<transcript>: Like that.

03:15:24
thdxr: ADAM STOP IT'S WORKING

03:15:26
<transcript>: Oh, can it be proxied.

03:15:29
<transcript>: Stop, it's working. Oh, it's working.

03:15:29
<transcript>: stop doing

03:15:32
<transcript>: Stop doing things. Stop touching it.

03:15:32
<transcript>: m t

03:16:14
<transcript>: i wonder

03:16:15
<transcript>: I wonder.

03:16:15
dermaxnh: it works

03:16:19
oskrm: it's still updating, the dns sometimes points to cloudflare and aws

03:16:21
oskrm: ns-1583.awsdns-05.co.uk

03:16:24
<transcript>: Like a DNS cache issue, right? Not like my browser cache.

03:16:26
thdxr: maybe cloudflare dns is slow

03:16:30
oskrm: and alberto.ns.cloudflare.com

03:16:35
<transcript>: So then I wonder, is there more efficient way to do this? I want the most efficient way. Also, I want to make sure the WWE Readerx does WWE Redirect for you.

03:16:39
<transcript>: It works. Welcome to Chat Dermix. Awesome. Thanks for the following this shark.

03:16:46
memph1s: `Request URL: https://adam.tv/ Request method: GET Status code: 302 `

03:16:48
<transcript>: It's working for a lot of people. Can somebody tell me if WW also redirects.

03:16:48
<transcript>: i

03:16:51
lilfreezi: www does not

03:16:52
<transcript>: I think Klopp Florida DNS is slow. I honestly I do.

03:16:55
cowfacedude99: guess you need to refresh your dns cache

03:16:55
thdxr: www will need its own page rule

03:17:00
rudixworld: whadup?

03:17:02
<transcript>: Route 53 for DNA for Forever, and I've never felt like it was slow, but I feel like cloud flare DNS is just slow or it has just a longer default TTL or something.

03:17:03
edmund311: www.adam.tv does not redirect.

03:17:05
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:17:05
<transcript>: wwe

03:17:08
amberdev: www is not redirected

03:17:09
<transcript>: Wwe does not need to refresh your DNS cache.

03:17:09
stroopwafel26: maybe people who it's working for are using 1.1.1.1 for dns

03:17:10
<transcript>: How would I do that.

03:17:14
<transcript>: We'll need its own page rule. Okay.

03:17:14
<transcript>: so let's

03:17:16
<transcript>: So let's do www.

03:17:16
lilfreezi: @stroopwafel26 ur on to something

03:17:21
<transcript>: If I just do another C name just like this that should work.

03:17:22
amberdev: www to CNAME

03:17:24
thdxr: you also need a dummy record yeah

03:17:25
<transcript>: Ww also goes to Adam Dev.

03:17:29
<transcript>: device

03:17:32
<transcript>: Device? Oh, Adam, Dev.

03:17:39
<transcript>: And then that should kick in the redirect as well. Also need a dummy record. Yeah. Okay.

03:17:47
<transcript>: Maybe people who it's working for using one. One, one for DNS.

03:17:52
<transcript>: Okay, I've updated the WW.

03:17:54
<transcript>: Tv.

03:17:54
<transcript>: that

03:17:56
<transcript>: That working for anybody.

03:18:05

03:18:05
<transcript>: some dns

03:18:08
thdxr: adam.tv hasn't worked for me yet either

03:18:09

alalfakawma: redirect to twitch

03:18:20
amberdev: does not work

03:18:22
<transcript>: You're saying that the www needs to record.

03:18:26
lilfreezi: nord vpn saying "The following error was encountered while trying to retrieve the URL: http://www.adam.tv/ Unable to determine IP address from hostname www.adam.tv The DNS server returned: Name Error: The domain name does not exist."

<transcript>: Oh, WW is working for DAX. Oh, my word. What a mess. Dns, though. Piece.

03:18:49

<transcript>: Hate it, hate it so much.

03:18:51
oskrm: www gives 502 now

03:18:53
alalfakawma: adam.tv is working for me

03:18:55
pandarris: it needs 302 redirect in response header

03:18:58
alalfakawma: www doesn't work

03:18:59
<transcript>: I'm gonna try my phone. I don't think that'll make a difference.

03:19:05
<transcript>: Oh, it does work. Okay. So WW.

03:19:12
<transcript>: So it's just some kind of caching issue for me on WW does not work.

03:19:12
<transcript>: but i'm gonna

03:19:16
<transcript>: But I'm gonna give it some time. We're just gonna give the time. I think this is fine.

thdxr: @stroopwafel26 cloudflare dns supports cname at apex by faking an A record

03:19:21
<transcript>: Needs 302 Redirect and Response Header Pan errors.

03:19:21
<transcript>: i think we

03:19:28
<transcript>: I think we have that redirect rule doing a 302 for everything on the domain. It may just take time.

03:19:34
<transcript>: Cloud Flared DNS supports CNAME at apex by faking an A record. Okay.

03:19:40
rudixworld: sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

stroopwafel26: chrome caches dns stuff like it's nobodies business

03:20:39

<transcript>: chromecast is

03:20:55
<transcript>: Chromecast is DNS stuff like it's nobody's business.

03:20:58
<transcript>: It's a Chrome thing.

03:20:58
<transcript>: so

03:20:59
thdxr: try `sudo shutdown now`

03:22:18
<transcript>: record but

03:22:20
thdxr: I saw we go back to debugging tsconfig in the meantime

03:22:25
<transcript>: Record. But doesn't that a record have to have an IP address? I can't just do like Adam Dev with an A record, right.

03:22:29
<transcript>: Let's go back to Debugging TS? Config in the meantime. Yeah, Yeah.

03:22:31
<transcript>: Okay.

03:22:32
oskrm: add a new redirect rule for the www

03:22:35
<transcript>: Which do I hate? More DNS? Or TS? Config.

03:22:37
<transcript>: Question.

03:22:40
stroopwafel26: Both www and apex give back the same DNS records for me, works works! :)

03:22:44
<transcript>: Okay. I think this is actually working. Now we were able to build. So let's just move on. Let's start building features. What do you say.

03:22:44
<transcript>: good acts i really

03:22:50
<transcript>: Good acts. I really do want SSD version two. I want it like yesterday. So I need you to fix those bugs.

03:23:00
<transcript>: I. Yeah, I think I added that redirect Oscar for www. Well, I did a I just did a star for the whole thing, right.

03:23:02
thdxr: I'm too busy watching this stream to fix sst bugs

03:23:05
<transcript>: Okay. So Stroop says it's where this is a cache thing. It's gonna work.

03:23:13
devizowl: lurker here, in Australia, adam.tv redirects to this twitch page, www.adam.tv gets a cloudflare error

03:23:14
<transcript>: leader

03:23:15
amberdev: * is a bad thing for DNS

03:23:20
stroopwafel26: @thdxr ban yourself /s

03:23:21
<transcript>: Leader count. Okay, all of those have to be system actions. Users can't do them only the system.

03:23:26
stroopwafel26: GMTA

03:23:28
<transcript>: I'll talk through my offset up and why I do all this weird stuff later. Right now I just want to keep moving.

03:23:28
<transcript>: so

03:23:32
<transcript>: So. Okay, we got our schema. I should be able to deploy this thing now.

03:23:39
<transcript>: I'm gonna call it.

03:23:45
<transcript>: Getting tired of my stacks all being named the same thing in this account. Maybe I should have stepped account for this now.

03:23:45
<transcript>: aw

03:23:48
<transcript>: Aw gets API stack.

03:23:56
<transcript>: Look at all these emitted types or emitted JavaScript files.

03:24:06
<transcript>: This would be.

03:24:06
<transcript>: aw

03:24:11
<transcript>: Aw, guess apex my three year old is angry.

03:24:25
<transcript>: lurke

03:24:32
stroopwafel26: maybe your 3 y/o is trying to do something in cloudflare dns

03:24:36
<transcript>: Lurker here, Debbie. Welcome to Chat in Australia. Anniversary TV redirects to the Twitch page. Ww gets a Cloudflare error. That's also what I'm seeing. Devy in Firefox.

03:24:39
<transcript>: But.

03:24:45
<transcript>: Material is trying to do something with Cloudflower DNS exactly.

03:24:47
<transcript>: Oh, man.

03:24:52
devizowl: using edge LUL

03:24:57
<transcript>: I think I need to get more time. If you're getting DNS issues with the redirects, just give it more time. We'll see using the edge.

03:25:00
<transcript>: It's the edges fault. I blame the edge.

03:25:06
<transcript>: I need to get the actual hosted zone right here.

03:25:09
<transcript>: Let's see that.

03:25:12
<transcript>: First forever.

03:25:20
<transcript>: One of my looking for somebody tell me what I'm looking for.

03:25:20
<transcript>: eight of

<transcript>: Eight of you guess. Oh, no, I'm not even using it if you guess on. Aws, what? It's on? Versaille.

03:25:31
<transcript>: That's not it. Versailles.

03:25:39
<transcript>: I need a logo if somebody wants to make a logo for AW, guess.

03:25:42
<transcript>: That'd be great.

03:25:42
<transcript>: and you know

03:25:45
<transcript>: And you know my desk next week, before we invent.

03:25:49
<transcript>: Domains.

03:25:49
<transcript>: okay

03:25:52
<transcript>: Okay. So I want to move this.

03:25:57
<transcript>: That's not one to do. I want to move this domain.

03:25:59
stroopwafel26: I'll put it in the parking lot

03:25:59
<transcript>: I could have just done it in REUTE. Now.

03:26:03
oskrm: is this a guessing game for aws services? LUL

03:26:05
memph1s: xd

03:26:06
<transcript>: Do DNS records and more. Here we go. Aw, guess has an A record pointing to that thing.

03:26:08
<transcript>: Cname.

03:26:12
<transcript>: I'm gonna do this on Route 53, because.

03:26:12
<transcript>: cloud

03:26:14
<transcript>: Cloud flare. I'm not so sure.

03:26:14
<transcript>: i

03:26:18
<transcript>: I'm not so sure about Cloudflare any of you Guess.com.

03:26:27
<transcript>: The guessing game. Yeah. For AWS Services, that's ride, Oscar, you see the logo and you have to guess, what is the service.

03:26:31
<transcript>: It's pretty great. And if we ever get it deployed, it'll be fantastic.

03:26:31
<transcript>: so

03:26:35
<transcript>: So here's our host of zones I'm gonna go into.

03:26:39
<transcript>: This is gonna take down AWS. Comm for now, but that's fine.

03:26:41
thdxr: cloudflare stock is up 8% today on news that adamdotdev is using it

03:26:42
<transcript>: Domain list.

03:26:55
<transcript>: Okay.

03:27:03
<transcript>: Oh, DAX, if you're still here. No, you should be fixing bugs. But if you're still here, I watch the.

03:27:03
<transcript>: i watch the

03:27:05
stroopwafel26: if i knew this beforehand i would've bought into it

03:27:08
<transcript>: I watch the DT Day videos. Those were as advertised. Fantastic.

03:27:19
thdxr: I love GT Dave

03:27:44
<transcript>: that's impressive

03:27:49
<transcript>: That's impressive. 8%. That's awesome. If I knew this before and I would have bought into it.

03:27:53
<transcript>: But into what Stroop.

03:27:53
<transcript>: oh

03:28:01
<transcript>: Oh, you're talking about that GT, Dave? How about GTD, Dave? Let's pour one out for GDP, Dave. Or not pour one out. He doesn't need anything poured out.

03:28:01
<transcript>: four

03:28:02
stroopwafel26: cloudflare stocks

03:28:03
<transcript>: Four out of kombucha.

03:28:06
<transcript>: What? Oh, I need to go back to.

03:28:09
<transcript>: Here. So we added those.

03:28:11
stroopwafel26: gotta get that sweet 8%

03:28:14
<transcript>: So here's the hosted Zone ID. We're gonna put that in here.

03:28:19
<transcript>: Like that.

03:28:19
<transcript>: aw

03:28:22
<transcript>: Awest.com API.

03:28:30
<transcript>: Guess we're still gonna we're still gonna use verselle for the front end on this thing. That's the problem, DAX. The reason I don't just use.

03:28:40
<transcript>: Ssc. Right. This second. Well, first of all, because version Two is not ready, and I feel like I want version Two. I want the Pnpm stuff. I want all of it.

03:28:55
<transcript>: The other thing is if I do use Next JS for some apps, I'm gonna be using Astro for most everything that's new. But for this one this is AWS game is mostly a spa. It's like a very front and heavy thing, and I just felt like I should stick with Next JS on it.

03:28:55
<transcript>: not move

03:29:01
<transcript>: Not move to Astro. I'm still like, I'd have to learn solid, and I've got to build this thing this week, like, reinforcement is in two weeks.

03:29:01
<transcript>: i gotta get

03:29:08
<transcript>: I gotta get it done, so I'm gonna use next JS. I'm gonna want to deploy that to Versaille because next JS everywhere else sucks.

03:29:08
<transcript>: so

03:29:10
<transcript>: So in that sense.

03:29:10
<transcript>: does

03:29:16
<transcript>: Does SST get weird if I'm using like turbo repo and I want to have a front end that's next JS.

03:29:16
<transcript>: can sst

03:29:19
<transcript>: Can SST live in just the package in my turbo repo.

03:29:21
<transcript>: And also donate.

03:29:21
<transcript>: the test

03:29:24
<transcript>: The tests. You should be fixing bugs.

03:29:29
thdxr: crap

03:29:31
<transcript>: Nope. Delete that one.

03:29:36
<transcript>: I'll have generated TypeScript files sprinkled throughout this project. Mathema.

03:29:40
<transcript>: Okay.

03:29:40
<transcript>: so

03:29:48
<transcript>: So we got our hosted zone. I've pointed the Namecheap to that so AW, get should go offline.

03:29:50
<transcript>: Shortly.

03:29:50
<transcript>: never dn

03:29:55
<transcript>: Never DNS propagates. So maybe never I don't know, 48 hours.

03:29:58
<transcript>: Okay.

03:30:02
<transcript>: For sell, we'll stop working.

03:30:02
thdxr: it doesn't get weird if you deploy your frontend to vercel (we'r eactually making constructs for this) but sst probably doesn't add much value for awguess since it seems like it's mostly running inside next?

03:30:04
<transcript>: Atom TV.

03:30:04
<transcript>: still doesn't work

03:30:08
<transcript>: Still doesn't work on my Chrome because it's so annoying.

03:30:16
<transcript>: Yeah. See, Chrome is just it's got the DNS stuff cached. That's the thing.

03:30:22
<transcript>: Ah see yeah Firefox does not have the DNS stuff cached.

03:30:27
<transcript>: It doesn't get weird if you deploy your frontend of Versaille. Where.

03:30:27
<transcript>: actually

03:30:34
lilfreezi: chrome://net-internals/#dns

03:30:38
<transcript>: Actually making contracts for this, but SST probably doesn't add much value for a to BS, since it seems like it's mostly running inside. Next. No, actually, next. I'm building the whole API on AWS. I give up on the T three stack for this.

03:30:41
lilfreezi: clear chrome dns cache there

03:30:42
<transcript>: I want to actually build it.

03:30:47
<transcript>: With AWS cow face. Thank you so much for the follow.

03:30:49
stroopwafel26: just about to say ^

03:30:54
<transcript>: I really appreciate that calface who's been here actively with me for like three months. I really appreciate it. The follow.

03:30:54
<transcript>: thank you for

rudixworld: like amplify?

03:31:02
<transcript>: Thank you for the following. I can't believe I miss those.

03:31:07
<transcript>: Clear Chrome DNS catch there. Oh, cool.

03:31:10
thdxr: ahh yeah the other thing is SST works best when you start a fresh project on it, you'll need to restructure a good amount so probably shouldn't move awguess

03:31:11
<transcript>: Just gonna keep pasting commands.

03:31:12
thdxr: omg adam.tv finally works for me

03:31:14
<transcript>: From my chat clear host cache.

03:31:17
<transcript>: Okay.

03:31:17
<transcript>: let's try it

03:31:18
<transcript>: Let's try it.

03:31:22
<transcript>: Let's try it. I'm TV.

03:31:27
<transcript>: Hey, wait, no, that one should work. It's this one that shouldn't work.

03:31:27
<transcript>: so no didn't

03:31:27
deni1111: uuuuu i saws cdk and i followed

03:31:28
<transcript>: So no didn't do it. Yeah.

03:31:31
<transcript>: Clearhost cache.

03:31:33
<transcript>: I.

03:31:33
<transcript>: saw cd

03:31:38
<transcript>: Saw CDK and I followed Dennis we were working on the CDK.

03:31:38
<transcript>: i don't

03:31:40
deni1111: NOICE

03:31:41
<transcript>: I don't know. Tv works for DAX. Alright.

03:31:45
<transcript>: Danny, thank you for the follow. Also. Oost, thank you for the follow.

03:31:49
<transcript>: Well do I need to do like this? Look up.

03:31:56
<transcript>: An error occurred named not resolved I don't see where I can clear I can click this button nothing seems to happen.

03:32:01
<transcript>: Still.

03:32:01
<transcript>: still can't redirect

03:32:06
<transcript>: Still can't redirect Adam TV and my Chrome. It works on other things. I give up. It's fine.

03:32:06
stroopwafel26: ‚ùØ host adam.tv adam.tv has address 172.67.220.76 ‚ùØ curl adam.tv curl: (6) Could not resolve host: adam.tv

03:32:09
stroopwafel26: mind=blown

03:32:11
<transcript>: Okay. Let's deploy this thing. I think we can deploy.

03:32:11
<transcript>: this

03:32:13
<transcript>: This stack. Now.

03:32:14
rudixworld: chrome needs update ... try that

03:32:17
<transcript>: Let's do it beyond build and yarn.

03:32:17
<transcript>: deploy

03:32:19
<transcript>: Deploy.

03:32:23
<transcript>: Do it.

03:32:23
<transcript>: do it

03:32:24
<transcript>: Do it.

03:32:24
<transcript>: chrome needs

03:32:26
deni1111: what is the problem

03:32:27
<transcript>: Chrome needs an update. Yeah, that might be it.

03:32:34
deni1111: cloudfront does not invalidate

03:32:37
<transcript>: Danny, no problem. We just.

03:32:37
<transcript>: cloud front does not

03:32:38
deni1111: ?

03:32:42
<transcript>: Cloud front does not invalidate. Now I we're just doing some stuff. We were just redirecting.

03:32:42
<transcript>: i now have

03:32:45
<transcript>: I now have the domainatom TV.

03:32:45
<transcript>: and we

03:32:50
<transcript>: And we tried to set up some Cloudflare redirects, and they work everywhere but my Chrome.

03:32:50
<transcript>: ichrome

03:32:52
<transcript>: Ichrome does not seem to do the reader.

03:32:52
<transcript>: so

03:32:54
<transcript>: So that's a bummer.

03:32:54
<transcript>: but it'll

03:33:01
<transcript>: But it'll work eventually. Dns is just slow and this one should stop working because I.

03:33:01
<transcript>: changed the

03:33:04
thdxr: I figured out your tsconfig issue from before, you have to switch to linux and it'll be fixed

03:33:07
<transcript>: Changed the name Servers, but it's still working in Chrome because Chrome Chrome is cashing it or something.

03:33:09
<transcript>: All right, we're publishing.

03:33:09
<transcript>: it's still called ap

03:33:12
<transcript>: It's still called API Stack. I thought I renamed it.

03:33:12
<transcript>: what

03:33:16
<transcript>: What I renamed it. Did I not.

03:33:21
rudixworld: in network settings you could try changing the dns to Cloudflare or 8.8.8.8 (google)

03:33:22
<transcript>: Did I not rename API stack the name is right there.

03:33:22
thdxr: renaming the class won't rename the stack right

03:33:24
<transcript>: No.

03:33:32
<transcript>: I cancel. I can't cancel. Okay. I got a P. This is gonna take a minute anyway. I will be right back.

03:33:34
thdxr: also does CDK not automatically prefix stacks with app name?

03:33:53
deni1111: is this open source

03:34:04
deni1111: i wanna look at someone leses cdk code

03:34:13
pbertrand_dev: delvoiDHype delvoiDHype delvoiDHype delvoiDHype

03:34:17
deni1111: how they they structure things

03:34:20
delvoid: Heyoooo

03:34:28
thdxr: it's delvoid

03:34:30
thdxr: hello

03:34:40

03:40:22
<transcript>: al

03:40:25
<transcript>: Alvi, thank you for the follow.

03:40:29
<transcript>: The CDK now automatically prefix stacks with that name.

03:40:41
<transcript>: I'm just going back further in chat figured out your Tsk big issue from before you just have to switch to Linux. Got it.

03:40:41
<transcript>: and network set

03:40:45
parkour_peter: Hello everyone!

03:40:49
<transcript>: And network settings. You can try to change the DNS to Cloudflare or eight eight. Google renaming the class won't read in the stack, right? Yeah. Good call.

03:40:49
<transcript>: yeah it

03:40:51
<transcript>: Yeah, it is open source. Denny.

03:41:01
<transcript>: It is open source. Aw. Guess is the repo. The Reposit dated. I'm gonna push a butthold. New repo soon.

03:41:01
<transcript>: but yeah

03:41:04
<transcript>: But yeah, everything I'm doing will be open source.

03:41:37
<transcript>: okay

03:41:40
<transcript>: Okay. This should be okay.

03:41:44
<transcript>: We have an API.

03:41:47
<transcript>: Let's see if we can.

03:41:52
parkour_peter: Is this great lego collection behind you?

03:41:52
<transcript>: I want to rename it say to be guess API's back, but that means.

03:41:55
<transcript>: That means something.

03:41:58
<transcript>: That means we.

03:42:07
<transcript>: Actually renamed this.

03:42:07
<transcript>: back

03:42:08
<transcript>: Back.

03:42:09
<transcript>: To.

03:42:20
<transcript>: This is now just API stack.

03:42:28
<transcript>: As well. So this is going to re it's going to delete it all and start out.

03:42:29
<transcript>: But.

03:42:33
<transcript>: Me. Do you know? What can you do about it.

03:42:37
<transcript>: I can do nothing about it.

03:42:39
<transcript>: But I can.

03:42:39
<transcript>: let's

03:42:42
<transcript>: Let's see CDK, context.

03:42:42
<transcript>: prod

03:42:44
<transcript>: Prod true.

03:42:50
<transcript>: We're just gonna have productions. There will be no anything else.

03:42:56
<transcript>: I'm gonna have to rebuild.

03:42:56
<transcript>: yarn build

03:43:00
<transcript>: Yarn build and redeploy bummer it's gonna believe all that other stuff.

03:43:05
<transcript>: Or maybe it's not, and I might need to manually delete it actually.

03:43:05
<transcript>: let's go

03:43:07
<transcript>: Let's go to.

03:43:07
<transcript>: cloud

03:43:10
<transcript>: Cloud formation.

03:43:18
<transcript>: Yeah, it's not gonna delete the old one. I need to delete it because there's gonna be duelicate stuff.

03:43:21
<transcript>: Api stack.

03:43:23
<transcript>: Was that the one.

03:43:28
<transcript>: Update complete. Yeah. Delete this thing.

03:43:29
deni1111: ohhh s3 buckets suck with cdk

03:43:36
<transcript>: And hurry, please do it quickly.

03:43:41
<transcript>: This account is such a mess, and I just keep making it worse.

03:43:41
<transcript>: s three

03:43:43
<transcript>: S, Three Buckets suck with CDK.

03:43:43
<transcript>: is

03:43:47
<transcript>: Is this great Lego Collection behind you? It is.

03:43:47
<transcript>: it's

03:43:48
deni1111: unless you set removal policy

03:43:59
<transcript>: It's modular buildings. You know what? I actually wanted to see if this redirects working. Nope. We'll see if this one's still working. Ah, that one's sick. Okay, cool. And by fix, I mean, not working anymore. Which is what I was hoping.

03:44:04
oskrm: "fixed"

03:44:09
<transcript>: Lego Modular 2023 I wonder if this has been leaked yet. These things are generally leaked. Oh, maybe it's not even linked. Maybe it's straight up, announced.

03:44:09
<transcript>: this is a nasty

03:44:10
<transcript>: This is a nasty.

03:44:16
<transcript>: Is the new Lego Modular announced.

03:44:16
<transcript>: that i

03:44:18
<transcript>: That I miss it.

03:44:18
<transcript>: no

03:44:20
<transcript>: No, this is a no.

03:44:20
<transcript>: this is like

03:44:23
<transcript>: This is like a Marvel thing. Never mind.

03:44:23
<transcript>: it is

03:44:26
<transcript>: It is look, it looks like a modular building.

03:44:31
<transcript>: 23 building leaks. Uhoh, it has been leaked.

03:44:34
<transcript>: Where is it.

03:44:38
<transcript>: Lego Icons rumored.

03:44:38
<transcript>: sorry

03:44:43
<transcript>: Sorry. I know none of you care about this, but you know it's something I care about, and I want to look it up.

03:44:52
<transcript>: Set information. Well, that's not helpful.

03:44:57
<transcript>: Available. Let's see, does it say what it's gonna be.

03:44:59
<transcript>: No.

03:44:59
<transcript>: there's

03:45:03
<transcript>: There's like a Reddit thread where there's just Lego leaks.

03:45:06
wyteryce_: do you watch lego masters?

03:45:09
<transcript>: Like Reddit. Lego leaks.

03:45:17
<transcript>: Do I watch Lego Masters? No, I've never watched it. I should.

03:45:25
<transcript>: Let's see if they I'm just gonna search this for modular. I just wonder if there's been a 2023 module P Three and Jazz club.

03:45:31
<transcript>: It has been leaked maybe I think for the follow just in time.

03:45:34
<transcript>: Or just.

03:45:37
<transcript>: Just Lin time.

03:45:40
<transcript>: It's a pizzeria.

03:45:48
<transcript>: January 1 P. Three on the lower floor Jazz Club on the top floor with brick built Jazz sign. Dark red color scheme. Interesting.

03:45:53
<transcript>: A graphic there's a graphic leaked.

03:45:55
<transcript>: Nah.

03:45:55
<transcript>: okay

03:45:58
<transcript>: Okay. Cool. Well, we'll see.

03:46:00
<transcript>: We will see.

03:46:00
<transcript>: it's not a

03:46:03
<transcript>: It's not a strip club, it says.

03:46:05
<transcript>: Okay.

03:46:05
<transcript>: i'm going to close all

03:46:07
<transcript>: I'm going to close all these.

03:46:14
<transcript>: Did it do it, do it roll back. So AWS failed because this probably has competing resources.

03:46:19
<transcript>: Oopsie.

03:46:25
<transcript>: Yeah, I couldn't create the table.

03:46:25
<transcript>: which has an

03:46:32
<transcript>: Which has an explicit name. I do that for a reason. It has an explicit name because of the global tables.

03:46:38
<transcript>: I can't remember why we have to do that. Why there has to be an explicit name, but there has to be.

03:46:40
<transcript>: So.

03:46:40
<transcript>: it's kind of

03:46:42
<transcript>: It's kind of a bummer, but.

03:46:45
<transcript>: That's that's what that is.

03:46:47
<transcript>: See did plain skill announce.

03:46:57
<transcript>: Need to edit that podcast so we can put it out as soon as they AHA, please go boost 36 seconds ago, people, this just came out. You're hearing it here first.

03:46:57

03:47:12

03:47:16
<transcript>: Let's sign up, join the waitlist.

03:47:18
<transcript>: Join.

03:47:18
<transcript>: and join the

03:47:20
<transcript>: And join the waitlist.

03:47:22
<transcript>: Let's go back to the.

03:47:25
<transcript>: Post. So here it is. People.

03:47:29
<transcript>: Freshly hot off the press.

03:47:29
<transcript>: introducing

03:47:36
<transcript>: Introducing planoscale boost so basically like you can take any individual query and you can boost it.

03:47:36
<transcript>: you

03:47:41
<transcript>: You can say I want this query to be instant. How much space do I need for it.

03:47:41
<transcript>: and

03:47:43
<transcript>: And.

03:47:43
<transcript>: it's

03:47:45
<transcript>: It's now. Instant.

03:47:52
<transcript>: Memory. It's just like red from memory. Super stupid fast real time. So as data changes.

03:47:52
<transcript>: here you

03:47:56
<transcript>: Here you go. Query duration. Look at that.

03:47:56
<transcript>: used to take

03:47:57
rudixworld: url?

03:48:00
<transcript>: Used to take 749 milliseconds. Now it's like single digit.

03:48:00
<transcript>: it's

03:48:03
<transcript>: It's pretty incredible. Here's. The blog post.

03:48:04
adamdotdev: https://planetscale.com/blog/introducing-planetscale-boost

03:48:06
<transcript>: Right here.

03:48:19
<transcript>: So like you can do it for individual queries like with specific where clauses. So if you have like customers that are really active and they have a lot more data and their queries are slow now. You can just boost their queries so that they're super fast now or.

03:48:25
<transcript>: Whatever you want to do, it's pretty great. It's like cashing without having to think about caching.

03:48:28
<transcript>: Pretty cool.

03:48:44
<transcript>: Look at me. I'm retweeting.

03:48:46
<transcript>: A Planet Scale tweet.

03:48:51
<transcript>: And I'm a Dynamo shell.

03:48:56
nolset: Does it only work for SQL querying?

03:48:57
<transcript>: Well, I shouldn't be working.

03:49:00
<transcript>: This should be.

03:49:01
thdxr: dynamo is built on mysql so it's OK

03:49:09
<transcript>: All right, let's see if we can get this.

03:49:13
<transcript>: Api Sanct delete. Is it done? I think so.

03:49:13
<transcript>: let's play this one

03:49:14
<transcript>: Let's play this one.

03:49:21
<transcript>: Dynamo is built on my sequel, so it's okay.

03:49:28
<transcript>: Does it only work for SQL Querying? Yeah and all set it's all my sequel.

03:49:32
<transcript>: Mike Planted Skill is only my sequel.

03:49:35
<transcript>: The Dynamo doesn't need catches.

03:49:37
oskrm: yoursql?

03:49:39
<transcript>: This is Dynamo.

03:49:39
<transcript>: it's too fast

03:49:40
<transcript>: It's too fast for a cache.

03:50:01
<transcript>: I should probably wrap it up here.

03:50:07
<transcript>: Thank you for the ball. Rob.

03:50:08
rudixworld: I wonder will my AWS hasura instance will benefit from this

03:50:10
<transcript>: Didn't get very farther downstream.

03:50:11
oskrm: oursql, comrades

03:50:16
<transcript>: Our sequel.

03:50:29
<transcript>: We would have gotten further. Oh, Dynamo DB? Oh, I gotta delete it. The table isn't deleted.

03:50:34
<transcript>: Those right protection or whatever.

03:50:41
<transcript>: Tables.

03:50:42
<transcript>: Aw guess.

03:50:53
<transcript>: Okay.

03:50:55
<transcript>: We're deleting the table.

03:50:59
<transcript>: We're checking the redirect. Still doesn't work.

03:50:59
<transcript>: how's that even

03:51:00
<transcript>: How's that even possible.

03:51:04
oskrm: i hate those "type the name" to delete dialogs

03:51:07
<transcript>: Come on Chrome.

03:51:18
<transcript>: You hit us, type the name, then you hate AWS, because that's like everything you try and delete.

03:51:21
<transcript>: Deleting.

03:51:24
<transcript>: Okay. That's deleted. Now.

03:51:29
<transcript>: I think I can let's see go back to cloud formation.

03:51:31
<transcript>: Rollback in progress.

03:51:40
<transcript>: Yes, I'm definitely considering planet scale for projects now.

03:51:46
<transcript>: As opposed to Dynamo. And that's that's like something. Because I only ever use Dynamo.

03:52:12
<transcript>: Here we go. Straight again.

03:52:20
<transcript>: What a deal? What a deal.

03:52:44
<transcript>: So we'll test this API and then.

03:52:44
<transcript>: i'll probably

03:52:46

03:54:05
oskrm: npx create-next-app@latest --experimental-app

03:54:07
<transcript>: I never know. It seems like it generally does create a subdivision, but I know there's some things I think the CDK one I think it just like.

03:54:07
<transcript>: creates

03:54:09
<transcript>: Creates it in place.

03:54:14

<transcript>: That is the correct API Gateway config.

04:03:32
oskrm: @developmentrobot it's the new hot thing to hate

04:03:35
<transcript>: All that just to change a couple values. Oh, that's not public at Dev, though.

04:03:36
thdxr: You need to set the banner option in your function bundle (I don't remember how cdk's function accepts this)  set it to this: https://github.com/serverless-stack/sst/blob/sst2/packages/sst/src/runtime/node.ts#L121

04:04:12
nolset: @developmentrobot IMO no, you can use the tools that others built to make your platform better. Why recreate the wheel when someone else made it already?

04:04:15
<transcript>: What's the new high thing to hate microservices or microservices or reflection. Wow, I can't keep up with.

04:05:51
thdxr: you can remove `nodejs.banner` line

04:05:51
<transcript>: What's new JS.

04:06:01
<transcript>: Oh, that's just like if they've passed in a banner. You want to bring it? So I don't need that.

04:06:07
<transcript>: Banner type.

04:06:07

04:10:29
<transcript>: I'm not deploying my.

04:10:29
<transcript>: i'm not deploying

04:10:29
k1ngstream: actually I'm trying get more experience at web developer area

04:10:31
<transcript>: I'm not deploying my.

04:10:33
ameercodes: i still need to do the Certified Cloud Practioner Exam

04:10:35
<transcript>: Front end to AWS. I'm deploying it to.

04:10:39
<transcript>: Versell the backend API I'm deploying to.

04:10:41
<transcript>: And I'm just using the CDK.

04:10:50
<transcript>: Yeah. One moment we'll be doing a lot of that King stream. I'll spend more time on the web development than I will the API, probably because I'm slower.

04:10:50
<transcript>: still need to do

04:10:59
<transcript>: Still need to do certified Cloud Practition exam pressure. You get multiple surveys. Yeah. I got all the Certs Amir codes. I did them all. It's kind of like a parlor trick.

04:11:02
<transcript>: Let's see. So if that deployed.

04:11:08
oskrm: what stack is the backend?

04:11:09
<transcript>: Aw. Guest Table What was I we had an issue with the authorizer, so we'll see if the if this works now.

04:11:18
nolset: gotta collect them all!

04:11:18
<transcript>: Invalid or unexpected token. Let's factor our functions. Now.

04:11:20
ameercodes: Hope u dont mind, i sent u a connection request on Linkedin.

04:11:24
<transcript>: Lambda. Or as DAX likes to say, let's go to our lambdas.

04:11:31
<transcript>: What's stack is the backend. It's an App Sync API, which is a GraphQL managed service.

04:11:31
<transcript>: through aw

04:11:34
k1ngstream: Im studying HTML, CSS, JS, going to NODE and get REACT

04:11:36
thdxr: lambduhs

04:11:40
<transcript>: Through AWS. Gotta collect them all. Hope you don't mind. I sent you a connection request on LinkedIn. No, that's great. I don't use LinkedIn much, so I'm sorry if it takes me a bit to respond.

04:11:40
<transcript>: i'm just not

04:11:43
<transcript>: I'm just not much of a linkedinner linkedinner.

04:11:43
<transcript>: okay what

04:11:44
nexxeln: the pscale boost thing is like cdn for sql

04:11:47
<transcript>: Okay. What am I looking for? This is the stream listener. Don't need that.

04:11:47
<transcript>: appsink

04:11:49
<transcript>: Appsink Authorizer this is the one.

04:11:52
<transcript>: Let's go to module.

04:11:54
<transcript>: Logs.

04:11:55
ameercodes: @thdxr LOL "Lambduhs"

04:11:59
<transcript>: The PSC Boosting is like CDN for sequel. That's right.

04:12:01
<transcript>: The Lamb does.

04:12:09
<transcript>: You're studying HTML Cssjs going to node and get React yet King Stream I would say.

04:12:11
<transcript>: One thing I've been telling people.

04:12:11
<transcript>: don't be afraid

04:12:14
k1ngstream: Im complete beggining

04:12:20
<transcript>: Don't be afraid to like, play with other things than front end. There's so much more to learn on the friend. And I feel like if you were to play with like a CLI app just like a little.

04:12:24
<transcript>: Text in text out. So if you're learning JavaScript.

04:12:24
<transcript>: it's natur

04:12:31
<transcript>: It's natural to then learn some node JS and build a little CLI so like pass in.

04:12:51
<transcript>: Your name and have it repeat back your name too or something like play with that stuff if you if you feel like you're getting overwhelmed, if you feel like what learning, react and CSS and how to make stuff on the web look okay, and all the things involved with building your front end if it starts to feel overwhelming, try that. Try just a NodeJS CLI. Like what is the simplest thing you can build.

04:12:56
<transcript>: And get that kind of feedback where you're typing in stuff into the CLI.

04:12:56
<transcript>: i'm gonna do

04:12:57
parkour_peter: What you think about Nest.js?

04:12:58
<transcript>: I'm gonna do a terminal runtime.

04:12:58
<transcript>: user code

04:13:01
<transcript>: User code syntax that Invalid or unexpected token.

04:13:05
<transcript>: Dax? Something's broken.

04:13:06
k1ngstream: üôå

04:13:12
<transcript>: I've never done this with node 16. I've only ever done ESM with node 14 with.

04:13:15
<transcript>: A top bubble awaits.

04:13:15
<transcript>: you tell me this

04:13:17
<transcript>: You tell me this should work. And what is this.

04:13:22
<transcript>: Because it's failing immediately.

04:13:26
<transcript>: Immediately.

04:13:29
<transcript>: Let's go back to the function and kind of look at the code.

04:13:33
<transcript>: Too large.

04:13:33
<transcript>: that's unfortunate

04:13:35
<transcript>: That's unfortunate.

04:13:41
thdxr: what was the error?

04:13:47
<transcript>: Should I go back to note 16, I mean node 14.

04:13:52
<transcript>: I didn't need this banner stuff with no. 14.

04:13:52
<transcript>: what was

04:13:53
danohart: Nahh

04:13:54
oskrm: is dynamo like firestore? does it have realtime?

04:13:54
<transcript>: What was the error.

04:13:56
lilfreezi: NODE 18 GANG

04:13:57
danohart: newer is always better

04:13:58
lilfreezi: woops caps

04:14:01
<transcript>: Oh, that's just seriously close it. I seriously disclosed it.

04:14:02
tayloreddev: good old dependable node 14

04:14:04
<transcript>: I'll tell you.

04:14:08
thdxr: the banner stuff comes from a dependency that does `require(crypto)` instead of `import crypto`

04:14:09
<transcript>: No. 18 Gang Yeah I would use note 18 if Lambda supported it.

04:14:09
<transcript>: nah

04:14:11
<transcript>: Nah, welcome to chat.

04:14:11
<transcript>: dano

04:14:13
<transcript>: Dano.

04:14:14
oskrm: @LilFreezi 18.11 livin on the edge gang

04:14:15
<transcript>: Let's see.

04:14:15
<transcript>: this one

04:14:24
<transcript>: This one the air is undefined error, unconditional exception, Invalid or unexpected token syntax error. It's like it's bombing just Loading.

04:14:24
<transcript>: the

04:14:25
<transcript>: The function at all.

04:14:27
lilfreezi: anyone tried 19 yet

04:14:29
<transcript>: Here is the code for the function.

04:14:31
oskrm: with that node --watch command

04:14:33
nexxeln: i use node 19 so im more edgy than you @oskrM

04:14:34
<transcript>: Our client DynamoDB. Oh.

04:14:38
<transcript>: Well, this is my fault.

04:14:41
<transcript>: Part of this is definitely my fault.

04:14:42
oskrm: @nexxeln :(

04:14:45
<transcript>: And that's because I don't have all of these.

04:14:47
<transcript>: Oh.

04:14:51
nexxeln: lts is lame

04:14:52
<transcript>: Should we SDK.

04:14:55
<transcript>: Client DynamoDB.

04:14:55
<transcript>: among

04:14:58
<transcript>: Among other things. I need to add a bunch of stuff here.

04:15:00
thdxr: wait why don't you bundle those?

04:15:05
<transcript>: Don't mind me, DAX. Just a carry on. I'll let you know if I'm still stuck.

04:15:12
<transcript>: Lib. Dynamodb.

04:15:16
<transcript>: Client DynamoDB you till all these.

04:15:26
<transcript>: It. Is this the authorizer? Yeah.

04:15:33
<transcript>: I'm going to be live dynamodbutil, dynamondb.

04:15:35
<transcript>: But Yeah.

04:15:45
<transcript>: What do you think about Nest JS? I've never used it.

04:15:45
<transcript>: i've heard

04:15:50
<transcript>: I've heard good things. Is that a little like fire shorts that have real time? It does.

04:15:50
<transcript>: i mean

04:15:57
<transcript>: I mean as subscription. No, I'm sorry. It has a stream. Dynamo. You can subscribe to the Dynamo. Stream.

04:16:07
<transcript>: Newer is always better. Good old dependable node 14. That's right. The banner stuff comes from dependency that does require crypto. Instead of import crypto.

04:16:13
<transcript>: 1811 Living on the Edge game.

04:16:17
<transcript>: I use no. 21 personally.

04:16:21
<transcript>: That was a joke. I don't know how many high. I don't know how high node goes.

04:16:26
<transcript>: Why don't you bundle those? Wait, why don't you bundle those.

04:16:36
<transcript>: I've never bundled any of the SDK stuff. I just do it as known modules because I always ran into issues, but I was also using node 14, so maybe that's the problem.

04:16:38
<transcript>: You're saying you bundle all the SDK stuff.

04:16:41
<transcript>: Interesting.

04:16:41
<transcript>: i

04:16:46
<transcript>: I need to get onto the DAX ways. I really want to do things like that.

04:16:50
<transcript>: For these Lambda functions, especially.

04:16:53
<transcript>: I don't want to be different.

04:16:56
thdxr: yeah I bundle everything except for things with native dependencies like pg

04:17:03
<transcript>: Thank you for the following gaming with Crumulent. Yeah, I bundle everything except for things with native dependencies like PG. Wow. Okay.

04:17:05
<transcript>: I just bail out.

04:17:05
<transcript>: both

04:17:07
<transcript>: Both. Try. Let's see if this works. Now.

04:17:10
nexxeln: this seems so difficult to work with

04:17:15
<transcript>: It's straight, bombing.

04:17:15
<transcript>: like real bad

04:17:16
<transcript>: Like real bad.

04:17:19
<transcript>: Are we using node 16.

04:17:22
<transcript>: I gotta figure this stuff out.

04:17:29
<transcript>: I only need like one Lambda function two Lambda functions.

04:17:29
<transcript>: my author

04:17:32
<transcript>: My authorizer in my stream Listener thanks for the follow.

04:17:32
<transcript>: al

04:17:32
thdxr: @nexxeln it is but if you use SST you get all this same stuff but it works out of the box

04:17:34
<transcript>: Alieu.

04:17:34
<transcript>: this

04:17:41
nexxeln: sst for the win

04:17:50
<transcript>: This seems so difficult to work with. Yeah, this part is next. This is where I miss the T three sack. I bundle everything except for things. It is. But if you use SDC, you get all this same stuff. It works out. Box. Yeah, I need. I need SS TV to a need version two. Dax.

04:17:50
<transcript>: i need it

04:17:51
<transcript>: I need it.

04:17:51
<transcript>: what are these bugs

04:17:57
<transcript>: What are these bugs? Kind of live with the bugs import create require as top level create require.

04:18:01
<transcript>: So.

04:18:04
thdxr: the bug is that sst 2.0 doesn't work

04:18:07
<transcript>: What if I just tried to not.

04:18:07
<transcript>: bundle

04:18:10
<transcript>: Bundle or not do those all kind of modules.

04:18:12
<transcript>: Kind of bundle them all.

04:18:14
<transcript>: Try that.

04:18:20
nexxeln: i like vercel cause it lets me use aws without a credit card Kappa

04:18:21
<transcript>: Bug is at SSC two to doesn't work. I see. That's probably a deal breaker for me.

04:18:21
<transcript>: probably

04:18:22
<transcript>: Probably.

04:18:38
<transcript>: Because it lets you use AWS with out a credit card. Same with plants. Go right.

04:18:38
<transcript>: you get

04:18:40
<transcript>: You get to use AWS.

04:18:40
<transcript>: in a roundabout

04:18:42
<transcript>: In a Roundabout way.

04:18:45
nexxeln: yup

04:18:47
<transcript>: I like to go down to the metal, you know.

04:18:47
<transcript>: which

04:18:50
<transcript>: Which is a Lambda function.

04:18:56
<transcript>: The metal just keeps being redefined.

04:18:56
<transcript>: used to

04:18:56
anitrogen: can u do everything with any programming language? or are there certain stuff only doable with certain languages

04:18:57
oskrm: did you watch prime using vscode? https://clips.twitch.tv/GorgeousTawdryJuiceKappaWealth-wnOsGUkipRnCP1Q8

04:18:57
<transcript>: Used to like.

04:19:03
<transcript>: What vehicle does to a man? Oh, no. What did I do.

04:19:06
<transcript>: Oh, Wait, that's is that from Prime.

04:19:06
<transcript>: i have not

04:19:09
<transcript>: I have not seen any of prime ZS code stream I really want to watch.

04:19:09
<transcript>: can you do

04:19:14
<transcript>: Can you do everything with any programming language? Or are there certain stuff only doable with certain languages.

04:19:15
nexxeln: there's a friend of mine who manages his own bare metal server at his home

04:19:17
<transcript>: I think I'll definitely have strengths and weaknesses.

04:19:23
<transcript>: His own Bear Metal server that's intended.

04:19:23
<transcript>: beer chug

04:19:25
beerchug: Cheers!

04:19:26
<transcript>: Beer Chug thanks for the follow.

04:19:26
<transcript>: alright let's

04:19:28
<transcript>: Alright. Let's see if that anything.

04:19:30
<transcript>: I'm just straight leaking my token.

04:19:30
<transcript>: just don't even care

04:19:32
<transcript>: Just don't even care.

04:19:36
<transcript>: Okay syntax error in valid make sure it's not.

04:19:36
<transcript>: still deploying

04:19:38
<transcript>: Still deploying.

04:19:38
<transcript>: bummer

04:19:39
<transcript>: Bummer.

04:19:47
<transcript>: This Lambda function. Okay, next, I'm gonna go back to doing it the way I do it, which is node 14 until.

04:19:56
<transcript>: Your thing is ready? No. 14, nine, eight.

04:20:01
<transcript>: No SSD version Two is ready. We're doing this the Adam way.

04:20:01
<transcript>: you know i'm saying

04:20:03
<transcript>: You know, I'm saying.

04:20:09
<transcript>: Which is the old and busted way but it'll actually maybe work for me.

04:20:20
<transcript>: Cheers, beer, chug.

04:20:25
<transcript>: So used to metal was.

04:20:31
<transcript>: Buying a physical server, putting in your closet and running stuff on it.

04:20:34
<transcript>: Then.

04:20:34
<transcript>: then it was wrapped

04:20:36
<transcript>: Then it was wrapped. Base.

04:20:36
<transcript>: where

04:20:39
<transcript>: Where you just rent someone else's physical server.

04:20:39
<transcript>: and do stuff

04:20:41
<transcript>: And do stuff on it.

04:20:45
<transcript>: Then it was the class.

04:20:48
<transcript>: Rent someone else's computer.

04:20:51
<transcript>: Like on EC two.

04:20:51
<transcript>: and you

04:20:53
<transcript>: And you run your thing on it.

04:20:53
<transcript>: then

04:20:56
<transcript>: Then working on the metal.

04:20:56
<transcript>: turned into

04:20:57
<transcript>: Turned into.

04:20:58
oskrm: then rent a cpu count

04:21:01
<transcript>: Functions as a service.

04:21:04
<transcript>: Run a CPU count.

04:21:15
<transcript>: Into the service. Like Lambda. Now your metal is like.

04:21:17
<transcript>: A node JS runtime.

04:21:20
<transcript>: Or some other runtime.

04:21:26
<transcript>: And then the next thing higher than that with Managed services.

04:21:30
<transcript>: Your metal is an API.

04:21:34
<transcript>: Love it.

04:21:38
<transcript>: I like getting further and further away from the actual metal personally.

04:21:42
<transcript>: Well, that might just be me.

04:21:49
<transcript>: Just waiting on time for information. Just CloudFormation things. This is what we do.

04:21:54
<transcript>: What is that? Tuesday.

04:21:58
<transcript>: Tuesday doesn't have doesn't have a feel Seinfeld anybody.

04:22:05
<transcript>: We are, we are updating.

04:22:08
<transcript>: We are updating our Lambda function.

04:22:08
<transcript>: we are waiting

04:22:09
<transcript>: We are waiting.

04:22:18
<transcript>: I do love this new chair. I can like, oh, my sevenyearold. Just snuck up on me. Scared the death out of him. Scared me to death.

04:22:18
<transcript>: i love you

04:22:20
<transcript>: I love you.

04:22:24
<transcript>: They came in to get Laramars. That's funny.

04:22:28
nolset: what chair?

04:22:30
<transcript>: Still still updates.

04:22:38
<transcript>: This. Her. My two year old Daddy saw us.

04:22:40
<transcript>: Okay, let's see if this worked.

04:22:46
<transcript>: It worked. So it works with my node 14 thing.

04:22:52
<transcript>: What Char null set. I got a it's called a core core chair, Cork chair.

04:22:55
<transcript>: Through the court.

04:22:55
<transcript>: yeah it's like

04:22:57
<transcript>: Yeah, it's like this.

04:23:01
<transcript>: Court chair. Calm. It's like active sitting.

04:23:01
<transcript>: it's

04:23:06
<transcript>: It's like you move around on it and just like she is right there, see how she's moving around on it.

04:23:06
<transcript>: health

04:23:07
nexxeln: how do you use graphql on a solo project

04:23:09
nolset: woah

04:23:10
nexxeln: i can't imagine

04:23:11
oskrm: operation sneak-in in failed

04:23:13
<transcript>: Healthiest chair in the world. I was actually really uncomfortable the last few weeks like my Ergonomics, have been bad for a while.

04:23:13
<transcript>: and i

04:23:18
<transcript>: And I think it's gonna use a fixed, tight desk. And that limits your options.

04:23:26
<transcript>: Like I used to have an adjustable height anyway. Okay, this is working. Operations. Sneak in. Failed. Yeah. My kids.

04:23:26
<transcript>: how do you

04:23:30
<transcript>: How do you use graphical on a solar project? I'll show you next.

04:23:30
<transcript>: i mean

04:23:31
<transcript>: I mean.

04:23:31
<transcript>: i

04:23:33
<transcript>: I will show you.

04:23:33
<transcript>: we'll show you

04:23:35
<transcript>: We'll show you how I do it.

04:23:35
<transcript>: you're saying like

04:23:36
<transcript>: You're saying like.

04:23:36
<transcript>: why go to

04:23:38
<transcript>: Why go to all this trouble.

04:23:40
<transcript>: That's a good question.

04:23:40
<transcript>: it's a val

04:23:42
<transcript>: It's a valid question.

04:23:42
<transcript>: like

04:23:45
<transcript>: Like why write all of this, all of this stuff.

04:23:53
<transcript>: Just to have my own little API that I can mess with. I don't know what I do.

04:24:02
<transcript>: But it'll be a lot faster. I'll tell you that runtimewise the DevX experience is 1000 times worse.

04:24:02
<transcript>: but the performance

04:24:04
<transcript>: But the performance will probably be like.

04:24:04
<transcript>: thirty percent

04:24:07
<transcript>: 30% better, so worth it, in my opinion.

04:24:33
<transcript>: Okay. We've got a working API. We need to put the front end sign build front end of you guess web. So we've got an app dragory. We've got pages directory for some API wraps. We got the public. Okay. Now config.

04:24:38
<transcript>: After App directory optin.

04:24:47
<transcript>: So here's what we need on this. We need I'm using neck sauce. So I still need the Pages directory. That's a good call out.

04:24:51
<transcript>: We're gonna go to our front end.

04:24:51
<transcript>: so much

04:24:53
<transcript>: So much to set up here.

04:24:59
<transcript>: So much to set up. Let's see.

04:25:02
<transcript>: I need to add next sauce.

04:25:10
<transcript>: Yarn.

04:25:10
<transcript>: add

04:25:14
<transcript>: Add next off. What else am I gonna need.

04:25:20
<transcript>: I'll probably need some Radics stuff, but we'll get there.

04:25:24
<transcript>: Straighten no tail NCSS. I need to add tail end.

04:25:32
<transcript>: What is all this class names.

04:25:32
<transcript>: fathom

04:25:35
<transcript>: Fathom graphqography request.

04:25:35
<transcript>: oof

04:25:38
<transcript>: Oof. Okay, we want next off.

04:25:39
oskrm: swr vs react-query?

04:25:40
<transcript>: And also.

04:25:40
<transcript>: nick

04:25:43
<transcript>: Nick. Jeez. What happened.

04:25:48
<transcript>: Also next http proxy.

04:25:48
<transcript>: middleware

04:25:49
<transcript>: Middleware.

04:25:49
nexxeln: react-query cause mutations

04:25:53
<transcript>: Also.

04:26:02
<transcript>: Do the tailwind stuff here in a second. I think that's all for now.

04:26:12
<transcript>: Work this route. Oh, did I not push the packages? Web.

04:26:16
nexxeln: @adamdotdev have you seen unocss?

04:26:20
<transcript>: Oh AW, guess web. I want to rename that.

04:26:26
<transcript>: Web.

04:26:26
nexxeln: i have stopped using tw for uno

04:26:33
<transcript>: Did I do it right.

04:26:37
<transcript>: Oh, I know. What's? This.

04:26:37
<transcript>: i didn't put

04:26:39
<transcript>: I didn't put a trailing.

04:26:47
<transcript>: Okay.

04:26:47
<transcript>: renamed

04:26:49
<transcript>: Renamed this the web.

04:26:53
<transcript>: Name I can't see anything behind my.

04:26:59
<transcript>: Oh, man.

04:26:59
<transcript>: what a day

04:27:01
<transcript>: What a day, what a day it's been.

04:27:04
<transcript>: Okay.

04:27:04
<transcript>: cool

04:27:07
<transcript>: Cool. We did it.

04:27:10
<transcript>: So let's go back here. I mean.

04:27:16
<transcript>: Those two packages.

04:27:20
<transcript>: Swr versus Raquer. I use real.

04:27:24
<transcript>: Recques mutations. Have you seen.

04:27:24
<transcript>: who know

04:27:29
<transcript>: Who know CSS? No, tell me more stop using tail in for Unono. Really.

04:27:30
<transcript>: Wiz.

04:27:31
<transcript>: wizard

04:27:32
<transcript>: Wizard.

04:27:32
<transcript>: pretty big

04:27:40
<transcript>: Pretty big tailwind Homer, and I'm not ready to learn something new on the CS front, but I'd like to hear more.

04:27:40
nexxeln: github.com/unocss/unocss

04:27:42
<transcript>: Prettier.

04:27:44
nexxeln: its tw but better

04:27:46
<transcript>: So we got some code Gen.

04:27:55
<transcript>: It's tail end, but better. So it's familiar to tell. Like if I'm used to tailwind syntax. It's familiar.

04:27:57
<transcript>: What happened here.

04:28:00
hideoo: That's the beauty of Uno, you don't need to learn anything ^^

04:28:04
<transcript>: Buffers all screwed up.

04:28:13
hideoo: anything new*

04:28:15
<transcript>: So much to add here? We need.

04:28:19
<transcript>: Cogen YAML file.

04:28:46
<transcript>: Okay.

04:28:53
<transcript>: Override true Documents GraphQL. Oh, I'm doing all the stuff that's bad. I'm doing all the bad stuff.

04:28:53
nexxeln: yup!

04:29:02
<transcript>: All of it. I'm doing all the things that are so unnecessary in 2022, like I should not be using.

04:29:02
<transcript>: graph

04:29:04
<transcript>: Graph field code gin to do my.

04:29:04
<transcript>: like i shouldn't be

04:29:06
nexxeln: it already has a better ecosystem than tailwind imo

04:29:07
<transcript>: Like I shouldn't be creating GraphQL files.

04:29:10
<transcript>: New queries, that's bad.

04:29:10
<transcript>: so the

04:29:15
oskrm: i use unocss with deno, it's pretty good

04:29:15
<transcript>: So the beauty of you know, you don't need to learn anything. Oh, okay. Anything new.

04:29:19
<transcript>: It already has a better ecosystem than Tailwind. Wow.

04:29:23
<transcript>: This is all very intriguing. I can't believe I've not heard of it.

04:29:29
<transcript>: Kind of blowing my mind. Okay, so we have a CodeGen. Yaml.

04:29:29
<transcript>: not even

04:29:32
<transcript>: Not even close to Styles yet haven't gotten there.

04:29:36
<transcript>: We're gonna rename.

04:29:36
<transcript>: rename this

04:29:37
<transcript>: Rename this.

04:29:44
<transcript>: Let's see. I need the proxy.

04:29:47
theturde: have you tried "perfect bar"?

04:29:47
nexxeln: created by antfu (vue, vite, nuxt core team)

04:29:48
<transcript>: There's.

04:29:48
<transcript>: let's see

04:29:49
<transcript>: Let's see.

04:29:52
<transcript>: Queries.

04:29:58
<transcript>: Tsconfig Versell JSON.

04:30:00
<transcript>: Client.

04:30:06
<transcript>: That's not only that pages API so I need next off that.

04:30:06
<transcript>: and

04:30:08
hideoo: (and vitest)

04:30:08
<transcript>: And GraphQL.

04:30:17
<transcript>: So this is my proxy for development.

04:30:17
<transcript>: i need

04:30:21
<transcript>: I need this because of the way there's the cookie thing.

04:30:23
<transcript>: Yank.

04:30:29
<transcript>: Where was this? This was in Pages API.

04:30:29
<transcript>: graphq

<transcript>: Graphql TS.

04:30:38
<transcript>: Okay.

04:30:44
<transcript>: Hit token.

04:30:47
<transcript>: Mix off secret.

04:30:51
nexxeln: (and slidev)

04:30:57
hideoo: ^^

04:30:58
nexxeln: he has built too many things tbh

04:31:15
<transcript>: How much to do.

04:31:18
<transcript>: We're.

04:31:18
<transcript>: was

04:31:21
<transcript>: Was. See API adapter.

04:31:24
<transcript>: This.

04:31:27
rudixworld: what is the default planet scale port ... 80?

04:31:27
<transcript>: Api adapter.

04:31:32
<transcript>: I have no idea? Oh, oh, yeah? Yeah? That's.

04:31:32
<transcript>: the next

04:31:34
<transcript>: The next off thing.

04:31:38
<transcript>: What is this.

04:31:38
<transcript>: created

04:31:44
<transcript>: Created by the same person view beat and on the next core team.

04:31:44
<transcript>: have you tried perfect

04:31:48
<transcript>: Have you tried? Perfect bar. What is this? What is perfect bar.

04:31:51
<transcript>: Perfect bar.

04:31:58
<transcript>: Okay.

04:32:21
<transcript>: Okay.

<transcript>: My URL.

04:32:37
<transcript>: Where did I just create that API file.

04:32:40
<transcript>: Underwear, web.

04:32:46
<transcript>: Lib API.

04:32:49
<transcript>: Okay.

04:32:55
<transcript>: Dev use Global API.

04:32:58
<transcript>: Secret.

04:33:02
<transcript>: Headers.

04:33:10
<transcript>: If we use the Global API, we pass it in the cookie. Otherwise, the authorization header.

04:33:14
<transcript>: Things will follow MEK.

04:33:18
<transcript>: Client Euro.

04:33:25
<transcript>: And Dev we do that proxy through the API route. Yeah, Yeah.

04:33:37
<transcript>: So that live API. Why is that not resolved.

04:33:46
<transcript>: I need to do something to get the.

04:33:57
<transcript>: Way to do this right.

04:34:00
<transcript>: What is it.

04:34:00
<transcript>: paths

04:34:01
<transcript>: Paths, or something.

04:34:09
<transcript>: I did this by default. Index.

04:34:12
<transcript>: Is it not.

04:34:40
<transcript>: H. Url. Yeah, that's it.

04:34:45
<transcript>: In here. No.

04:34:56
<transcript>: Work.

04:35:00
<transcript>: I have cookie string authors, undefined.

04:35:03
<transcript>: This last I will type header string.

04:35:09
<transcript>: So headers.

04:35:14
<transcript>: Token. It bring okay. Token is a string.

04:35:16
<transcript>: Problem here.

04:35:25
<transcript>: Returns. Cookie. Oh, I see it's either cookie or authorization.

04:35:33
<transcript>: I just need to say.

04:35:39
<transcript>: Like that maybe.

04:35:58
<transcript>: A string.

04:36:03
<transcript>: Right. Everything is should be a string.

04:36:12
<transcript>: So that was done. I shouldn't have done that.

04:36:15
<transcript>: But how do I? How do I say.

04:36:20
<transcript>: Well, we could just say, like explicitly type this. Like this returns.

04:36:20
<transcript>: a

04:36:22
<transcript>: A record.

04:36:25
<transcript>: String, string.

04:36:25
<transcript>: that works

04:36:33
<transcript>: Okay. That works. Cool. Okay.

04:36:33
<transcript>: what is

04:36:38
<transcript>: What is the official planet skill Port? I'm not sure. Does anybody know the answer to that question.

04:36:48
<transcript>: The token.

04:36:54
<transcript>: I'm just trying to get basic connectivity to the API working.

04:36:56
<transcript>: It's off.

04:36:59
<transcript>: I guess I need to add on.

04:36:59
<transcript>: so we're gonna

04:37:04
<transcript>: So we're gonna have to have all this create client JS. Create in local.

04:37:04
<transcript>: par

04:37:07
<transcript>: Parse, tail, and ink. What is that.

04:37:11
<transcript>: Component.

04:37:16
<transcript>: Graphql think for the follow BKM coder.

04:37:24
<transcript>: Okay.

04:37:27
<transcript>: Api. This one.

04:37:30
<transcript>: Yank that.

04:37:43
<transcript>: Api we're gonna say off.

04:37:45
<transcript>: And then we're gonna create in there.

04:37:47
<transcript>: A.

04:37:47
<transcript>: dot

04:37:50
<transcript>: Dot. No, I'm sorry. Off.

04:37:54
<transcript>: Next.

04:37:54
<transcript>: off

04:37:55
<transcript>: Off.

04:37:57
<transcript>: Yes.

04:38:11
<transcript>: I've almost been streaming 5 hours that is long for me.

04:38:29
<transcript>: Hello with century.

04:38:31
<transcript>: User, by username.

04:38:36
<transcript>: I adapter.

04:38:39
<transcript>: That should be as bad. Oh, no, I haven't actually copied it over yet.

04:38:41
<transcript>: Couldn't do that.

04:38:41
<transcript>: ap

04:38:45
<transcript>: Api. Adapter? What is It, API.

04:38:47
<transcript>: Yeah, adapter.

04:38:50
<transcript>: Opjs.

04:38:50
<transcript>: an adapter

04:38:52
<transcript>: An adapter or adapter.

04:39:17
<transcript>: This is the makes all of our so this Avi adapter makes next off. Instead of using a database adapter, it actually does all the operations through my graphical API. So like my graph feel API is the source of truth for all of my off stuff. And when it creates users and does.

04:39:17
<transcript>: all that

04:39:27
<transcript>: All that for creating tokens. It interacts with my GraphQL API, but with a special authorization mode that's like machine learning machine only.

04:39:27
<transcript>: that's what that

04:39:28
<transcript>: That's what that is.

04:39:37
<transcript>: Create user.

04:39:37
<transcript>: where is that

04:39:39
<transcript>: Where is that? Come from.

04:39:45
<transcript>: Where does that come from.

04:39:50
<transcript>: Here.

04:39:53
<transcript>: In the world.

04:39:57
<transcript>: See? Where is that.

04:39:57
<transcript>: interface

04:40:01
<transcript>: Interface adapter? Oh, do I missing a.

04:40:01
<transcript>: refk

04:40:05
<transcript>: Refkh Hill Request Next Off adapters.

04:40:07
<transcript>: I shouldn't be missing.

04:40:07
<transcript>: okay

04:40:09
<transcript>: Okay, what's it say.

04:40:11
delvoid: Heyooo

04:40:12
<transcript>: High partial adapter User promises.

04:40:12
<transcript>: is not

04:40:14
<transcript>: Is not assignable type per.

04:40:14
<transcript>: weightable adap

04:40:17
<transcript>: Weightable, adaptable, user or adapter user, user.

04:40:23
<transcript>: A waitable so I've done some wrong.

04:40:28
<transcript>: Things have changed in next off. It looks like.

04:40:32
<transcript>: Okay.

04:40:38
<transcript>: Partial adapter user.

04:40:46
<transcript>: So I'm returning a promise adapter user a null and that's not assignable to a weightable adapter user.

04:40:55
<transcript>: What is this? A waitable.

04:41:01
<transcript>: Promise like.

04:41:08
<transcript>: Just go to the next off. Docs Bellow is here.

04:41:09
hideoo: Did the screen freeze?

04:41:14
<transcript>: I'm gonna use next off in a bit.

04:41:19
<transcript>: Adapter.

04:41:20
shintaii84: yes

04:41:25
<transcript>: They have a DynamoDB adapter. Why didn't they use it? I didn't like something about it.

04:41:33
hideoo: Good, not crazy Kappa

04:41:35
<transcript>: There were some reason I needed more control over it. It does use single table.

04:41:40
<transcript>: Why don't I just use that.

04:41:51
<transcript>: Can't remember. I feel like I even made changes to this.

04:41:54
<transcript>: I feel like I've maybe made it work for me.

04:42:01
<transcript>: Adaptor, DynamoDB.

04:42:07
<transcript>: Oh, yeah? Used to be a separate repo.

04:42:12
<transcript>: I feel like I made it where you can configure.

04:42:12
<transcript>: the

04:42:13
<transcript>: The.

04:42:18
<transcript>: Where was that.

04:42:32
<transcript>: Like you could configure the schema. Yeah, partition. Wait, now, that's not it.

04:42:40
<transcript>: Custom Schema Yeah, Yeah, I think I contributed this stuff. Table name, custom Table name Partitioning key? Yeah, Yeah.

04:42:48
<transcript>: So why don't I use it? Why did I want to use my GraphQL API? I don't remember.

04:42:48
<transcript>: and now i wonder

04:42:50
<transcript>: And now I wonder if I shouldn't.

04:42:50
<transcript>: so

04:42:52
<transcript>: So I just use the Dynamo thing.

04:42:56
<transcript>: If I could write it.

04:43:03
<transcript>: The screen froze.

04:43:07
<transcript>: Oh, it doesn't.

04:43:11
<transcript>: It does. Sometimes I'll fix it.

04:43:11
<transcript>: what do i have to

04:43:14
<transcript>: What do I have to do? It's like this thing gets frozen.

04:43:23
<transcript>: All Right, there we go.

04:43:23
<transcript>: i don't know why

04:43:26
<transcript>: I don't know why it does that. It's a new OBS thing.

04:43:26
<transcript>: it's like

04:43:30
<transcript>: It's like the new version of OBS. Sometimes does that.

04:43:30
<transcript>: i'm just

04:43:32
<transcript>: I'm just trying to decide if I want to.

04:43:47
<transcript>: I want to use this adapter or just have oh, I know why I did it because I didn't like having to create an eye am user just for Versaille to be able to interact with my Dynamo table. That felt bad. I didn't like it. That's what it was.

04:43:52
<transcript>: I guess it's not the end of the world, but.

04:44:16
<transcript>: Format.

04:44:50
<transcript>: Okay. What's promised? Like oh, bye.

04:44:54
<transcript>: What is promised like.

04:45:07
<transcript>: Examples of.

04:45:09
<transcript>: Running a custom.

04:45:09
<transcript>: adapter

04:45:11
<transcript>: Adapter.

04:45:15
<transcript>: Custom Napper. Here we go.

04:45:36
<transcript>: So what's different here? About what I'm doing.

04:45:39
<transcript>: Create user.

04:45:50
<transcript>: What is the problem.

04:45:55
<transcript>: I'm returning.

04:46:05
<transcript>: This. What is this? Oh, an any.

04:46:06
privann: Hey

04:46:08
<transcript>: Why is that an ID.

04:46:14
<transcript>: What's the problem here.

04:46:18
ecosse3: Hi

04:46:20
<transcript>: Oh, what a nightmare. This is such a mess.

04:46:20
<transcript>: trying to

04:46:26
<transcript>: Trying to feel like maybe just the dynamodapter and creating an Im user is the past of lease resistance actually.

04:46:35
<transcript>: Van.

04:46:38
<transcript>: Hello.

04:46:45
<transcript>: Inside.

04:46:51
<transcript>: If I want to keep doing what I'm doing here graphical request I haven't even added that library.

04:46:55
<transcript>: Oh, maybe I need to I'm actually not need to use.

04:46:55
<transcript>: i might

04:47:00
<transcript>: I might need to actually add it. That might be the problem. Yarn. Add.

04:47:03
<transcript>: To a request.

04:47:09
<transcript>: Is that the issue.

04:47:12
<transcript>: It doesn't have types. Maybe.

04:47:19
ecosse3: neovim <3

04:47:20
<transcript>: Yep. No. Still issue.

04:47:20
<transcript>: not

04:47:22
<transcript>: Not a sample type.

04:47:26
privann: How did you get the error message beneath?

04:47:28
<transcript>: I don't understand, though.

04:47:28
<transcript>: response

04:47:32
<transcript>: Response is a type. Any.

04:47:36
<transcript>: Is it is it on this side? Is it a type in.

04:47:43
<transcript>: Yeah, it's an in here. So why is it like it here.

04:47:43
<transcript>: what's that return

04:47:44
<transcript>: What's that? Return.

04:47:57
<transcript>: I really don't want to have all this code in my system. This is so much code.

04:47:57
<transcript>: how did you get the

04:47:59
<transcript>: How did you get the error message beneath.

04:47:59
<transcript>: what do you mean

04:48:03
<transcript>: What do you mean? The an error message that we just looked at.

04:48:06
<transcript>: You mean that area right there.

04:48:08
privann: correct

04:48:11
<transcript>: Yeah.

04:48:19
<transcript>: So this is neovem. My dot files are on GitHub, but this is like.

04:48:21
<transcript>: What am I using.

04:48:23
<transcript>: Cmp or something.

04:48:23
<transcript>: for

04:48:23
ecosse3: buf.lsp.hover

04:48:26
<transcript>: For the big boxes.

04:48:33
<transcript>: And then it's just the TypeScript language server that's giving that error.

04:48:38
<transcript>: Okay.

04:48:40
privann: aaah got ya

04:48:43
<transcript>: I feel like it's time to call it I thought I can maybe make it to 5 hours.

04:48:45
privann: I use NeoVim aswell

04:48:46
<transcript>: Oh, just because that's kind of around number.

04:48:51
<transcript>: Lsp Hover.

04:48:55
ecosse3: Me too :D

04:48:57
delvoid: 4:50 is round Kappa

04:49:00
<transcript>: Yeah. I can't decide what I'm gonna do here. The on the one hand.

04:49:05
<transcript>: Just use the DynamoDB adapter.

04:49:10
<transcript>: And I can make it fit my schema? How I'd like that's all fine.

04:49:10
<transcript>: i just have

04:49:19
<transcript>: I just have to create then like here next off access key and secret key. I've got to basically create an Im user just for.

04:49:19
<transcript>: vers

04:49:21
<transcript>: Versaille.

04:49:21
<transcript>: which

04:49:24
<transcript>: Which isn't such a big deal, I guess.

04:49:24
<transcript>: and maybe that's

04:49:25
<transcript>: And maybe that's the way to go.

04:49:26
ecosse3: you creating custom next auth adapter for your db/service?

04:49:37
<transcript>: So as a user.

04:49:40
<transcript>: Session account.

04:49:43
<transcript>: That would save a lot of work.

04:49:43
<transcript>: maybe

04:49:47
<transcript>: Maybe if I just could do the dance with the IAM user.

04:49:53
<transcript>: Yeah. What's the problem with that.

04:49:55
<transcript>: Is there a problem with that.

04:50:04
<transcript>: I don't think there is.

04:50:09
<transcript>: Even already did it once. So I've got all the code for, like.

04:50:09
<transcript>: creating it

04:50:12
<transcript>: Creating it in the CDK app.

04:50:17
<transcript>: In fact, it's right here. Let's see. Is it in the meta.

04:50:19
<transcript>: Yeah. Next. Yes. Im user.

04:50:24
<transcript>: Just create credentials and signing secret.

04:50:24
<transcript>: yeah i can

04:50:26
<transcript>: Yeah, I can just use this thing.

04:50:35
<transcript>: And it creates, let's see, access, key.

04:50:40
<transcript>: This also creates.

04:50:40
<transcript>: auth key

04:50:41
<transcript>: Auth key.

04:50:41
<transcript>: yeah

04:50:46
<transcript>: Yeah. Generate secret code. Yeah. This is. I just. I'm just doing this. I'm doing this.

04:50:49
ecosse3: I was using AWS Auth with next.js via amplify cognito

04:50:50
<transcript>: Not for this adapter. Nonsense. This is painful.

04:50:51
ecosse3: it was working well

04:51:02
<transcript>: Next off. So here instead of using API adapter, we would just use what's the integration secret Lib secrets.

04:51:12
<transcript>: Just have to actually generate my types to.

04:51:19
<transcript>: Achieve client. All right, this is enough for today.

04:51:25
<transcript>: Let's see, let's see what you all said.

04:51:25
<transcript>: for

04:51:28
<transcript>: For 50 is round. What's? 450.

04:51:31
<transcript>: Is round that's true.

04:51:31
<transcript>: creat

<transcript>: Creating custom necks off adapter for your DB server. Yeah, I did on public Dev.

04:51:36
<transcript>: i

04:51:43
<transcript>: I created an adapter that works with my API. It actually calls my APPSic API.

04:51:55
<transcript>: But it's a lot of work. I'm just kind of over it. I was using AWS off with next year Amplify Cognito. Is working well, yeah. I like, just using Next off.

04:51:55
<transcript>: personally

04:51:57
<transcript>: Personally.

04:52:01
<transcript>: And that involves whether tradeoffs.

04:52:05
<transcript>: But basically I have to like, do the next off.

04:52:08
<transcript>: Jot token decode. In.

04:52:08
<transcript>: custom authorized

04:52:11
<transcript>: Custom Authorized for My Apps and API.
