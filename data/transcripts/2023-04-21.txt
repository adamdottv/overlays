madeleinepatience: Morning :)

00:46:10
<transcript>: I don't know anything about trpc single function issues, but I know things like Prisma. I've felt the pain of deploying Prisma.

00:46:13
<transcript>: To like a functions as a service platform.

00:46:13
<transcript>: it's too

00:46:15
<transcript>: It's too big.

<transcript>: Yeah, Madeline.

00:47:41

00:49:23
greatgrievance: it's Miami... what do you expect?

00:49:37
average_engineer: like some kinda after party

00:49:38
<transcript>: There's some of them that they're big into the partying. Some of us are from the ozarks like me. And we're a little guarded from the world. And we get out into the city, and we meet some of the people from the other cities. And then we're not prepared for the partying that happens. That's what I gathered from what happened last night.

00:49:41
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. I'm going to keep going.

00:49:52
<transcript>: Average. I don't know if it's like.

00:50:30
<transcript>: Oh, versailles, ship? When's that.

00:50:38
<transcript>: Our render is even bigger of a party than Atlanta.

00:50:38
<transcript>: then react

00:50:40
pbertrand_dev: ROFL

00:50:40
<transcript>: Then React, Miami.

00:51:02
average_engineer: around1st to 5th may  vercel.com/ship

00:51:02
4ohfournotfound: vercel shi* or vercel ship? I misheard.

00:51:20
pbertrand_dev: Yeah I will come up to render. Wanna grab some chamomile tea, head to a party and pull an allnighter?

00:51:29
gitpush_gitpaid: @4ohFourNotFound both

00:51:49
average_engineer: i like the outfit of drax, wish i could present like that in my company meetings

00:52:11
<transcript>: Yeah, there is when is it gonna be unlocked.

00:52:22
goodgrandpaa: Shot you a DM, but you can take a look whenever you get a chance :)

00:52:40

00:52:43
<transcript>: Is it a coincidence.

00:52:49

00:52:52
pbertrand_dev: I thought thats how people in the ozarks party

00:52:56
<transcript>: Go great grievance, go.

00:52:56
gitpush_gitpaid: i thought dax was way shorter

00:53:00
<transcript>: You thought let's help people in the Osarks party.

00:53:05
goodgrandpaa: LUL @pbertrand_dev Guess so!

00:53:09
<transcript>: So you were just trolling birchrand. You don't put anything in your chamomile tea.

00:53:20
goodgrandpaa: oh my.. Adam, what have you put in your chamomile tea?!

00:53:21
pbertrand_dev: Yeah. Just a joke

00:54:31
<transcript>: Easy peasy welcome to Chat Matt in a subbie.

00:54:40
youlooksleepyman: looks awesome

00:54:50
<transcript>: Thank you. You look sleepy.

00:54:53
<transcript>: You should hear it. It sounds really good.

00:54:58
grasp5533: That was an SST sales pitch

00:55:04
<transcript>: Ssc sales pitch. That's what the whole talk was.

00:55:04
<transcript>: all just

00:55:06
<transcript>: All just got bamboozled.

00:55:06
youlooksleepyman: Kreygasm

<transcript>: We got work to do around here.

00:55:47
<transcript>: Okay.

00:55:55
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't know. He was being a little generous. I don't know if 10% of his Tweets are useful. That might be J.

00:55:58
jokestera_e: @cowFaceDev lol

00:55:59
<transcript>: There's a lot of trolling on Twitter. That's what Twitter is for, right.

00:56:02
<transcript>: Okay.

00:56:06
<transcript>: Where do we leave off yesterday.

00:56:10
<transcript>: I've worked since yesterday. I mean, since I streamed.

00:56:18

00:56:19
goodgrandpaa: statmuse uses tailwind?

00:56:20
cowfacedev: that sounds like this stream LUL. (I am trying to fill dax's space)

00:56:28
<transcript>: I would love to meet some twitch friends at render. Sam uses Joe, and yes, we sure do.

00:56:28
<transcript>: we do

00:56:33
pbertrand_dev: (I'm not actually going)

00:56:33
<transcript>: We do use Ho end. That sounds like this stream I'm trying to fill.

00:56:33
<transcript>: that good burn

00:56:34
goodgrandpaa: Very cool. I enjoy tailwind.

00:56:36
<transcript>: That good burn cafes, good burn.

00:56:37
llebc: what's a good developer blog to read? Looking for recommendations, not sure if this is the correct place to ask though haha

00:56:40
<transcript>: You're not actually going bird trend. I was getting.

00:56:40
<transcript>: i was getting really

00:56:43
<transcript>: I was getting really excited for some chamomile tea.

00:56:43
<transcript>: what's a good

00:56:49
<transcript>: What's a good developer blog to read, looking for recommendations. Not sure if this is the correct place to ask, though not a great place.

00:56:54
<transcript>: What are you into levik? Are you into front end.

00:56:54
<transcript>: back

00:56:56
<transcript>: Back end.

00:56:58
<transcript>: Middle end.

00:56:58
cowfacedev: depends on your interests.

00:57:00
<transcript>: Full stack.

00:57:03
<transcript>: Databases. I don't know.

00:57:03
<transcript>: depend

00:57:05
llebc: by trade I'm full stack so anything really!

00:57:07
goodgrandpaa: @pbertrand_dev Maybe you'll get the special chamomile tea.

00:57:08
<transcript>: Depends on your interest. Yeah. I've got some recommendations. Like if you're in the front end.

00:57:13
<transcript>: Josh Comeier is amazing. I probably said his name wrong.

00:57:14
goodgrandpaa: @llebc relatable.

00:57:14
julianfbeck: love the blog from fasterthanli.me

00:57:18
<transcript>: Kent's. Great.

00:57:25
<transcript>: Who else? We could definitely give you some recommendations. Back end. Oh, faster than lime is great. Yeah.

00:57:31
<transcript>: By trade. I'm full stack. So. Anything really? Okay. Yeah.

00:57:38
<transcript>: Blogging is kind of becoming like a lost art, isn't it? There's not a lot of new blogs coming around.

00:57:38
<transcript>: but

00:57:44
nikolaxhristov: t3ggHeh

00:57:44
<transcript>: But there's a lot of like old ebit, goodies people who've been doing it a long time.

00:57:44
<transcript>: and maybe

00:57:48
<transcript>: And maybe there's people doing it now and I just don't see it as much I think.

00:58:03
<transcript>: The whole Dev two and hash node thing. I feel like kind of diluted a little bit of the individual blogger. Now anybody can just write like a few posts. They don't have to do it a lot, but they can make a good post. It's like this is a really great article.

00:58:03
<transcript>: but less

00:58:08
<transcript>: But less like I follow this person and everything they write feels like that's been diluted a little bit.

00:58:12
mattmancodes: dev.to is, on the whole, terrible

00:58:17
<transcript>: Ryan Carnetto writes excellent individual posts. And as a collective, they're all very excellent.

00:58:19
llebc: that's what I find, that's what I always stumble upon either that or medium and fed up of reading them now :D

00:58:20
<transcript>: Who else.

00:58:21
youlooksleepyman: so many blogs now a days are just a rewrite of a documentation sometimes

00:58:26
<transcript>: Dev two on the whole I feel like there's a yeah, there's a low bar on dev two, there's a lot of cruft.

00:58:34
<transcript>: But that's what I find? That's what I always stumble upon. Either that or medium.

00:58:34
<transcript>: so many

00:58:39
<transcript>: So many blogs now just rerouted some documentation. Yeah.

00:58:39
<transcript>: let's pull up some good

00:58:42
<transcript>: Let's pull up some good ones. So here's a good one. Josh, Comey.

00:58:42
<transcript>: comeyo

00:58:44
<transcript>: Comeyo Camille.

00:58:44
<transcript>: josh

00:58:49
<transcript>: Josh writes incredibly high quality stuff like.

00:58:49
<transcript>: if you're

00:58:52
<transcript>: If you're all interested in front end topics.

00:58:53
mattmancodes: he is really good

00:58:54
<transcript>: This guy right here.

00:58:54
<transcript>: just

00:59:00
<transcript>: Just end up on his blog. Pick an article at random. I promise you it will not be a waste of time.

00:59:00
<transcript>: extremely

00:59:02
<transcript>: Extremely high quality.

00:59:02
<transcript>: really

00:59:05
<transcript>: Really knows how to explain things and just.

00:59:11
adamdotdev: https://www.joshwcomeau.com/

00:59:12
<transcript>: Help you go from zero to understanding something. So, Josh, really great blog. I'll paste. That right here.

00:59:17
<transcript>: Who else I mentioned can't can't see dods.

00:59:19
<transcript>: He's got a great blog.

00:59:19
<transcript>: these are people who

00:59:23
<transcript>: These are people who've done it for a really long time.

00:59:23
<transcript>: so

00:59:25
adamdotdev: https://kentcdodds.com/blog

00:59:25
<transcript>: So, like, just got a couple of hundred posts, right.

00:59:31
<transcript>: Somebody else let's talk back in so like back end.

00:59:38
<transcript>: Cloud stuff. I mean, I love Alex debris stuff.

00:59:43
greatgrievance: Martin Fowler's site isn't really a traditional blog but I'd count it

00:59:44
<transcript>: Alex has a blog. He's got a bunch of stuff in here if you're into.

00:59:44
<transcript>: like server

00:59:46
<transcript>: Like serverless.

00:59:46
<transcript>: stuff

00:59:47
<transcript>: Stuff.

00:59:50
adamdotdev: https://www.alexdebrie.com/

00:59:50
<transcript>: There's Alex. Debris.

00:59:53
<transcript>: Martin fowler, Wow.

00:59:55
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:59:57
<transcript>: That's an oldie.

01:00:02
<transcript>: Not a traditional blog. Yeah, but still count it. Yeah, good call.

01:00:07
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:00:10
adamdotdev: https://martinfowler.com/

01:00:11
<transcript>: It's less and less that there are new.

01:00:14
stronkbad: i have a question, whats the difference between framework and architecture?

01:00:17
<transcript>: Alex is going to really appreciate that. I just mentioned him in the same breath as Martin Fowler.

01:00:17
<transcript>: there

01:00:26
<transcript>: There's fewer people coming out and creating new blogs and leaving their Mark. In that way, I feel like which is kind of a bummer.

01:00:31
<transcript>: Maybe there are. And I'm just not seeing them. It might be just my attention span. Honestly.

01:00:34
grasp5533: Burning monk is good for serverless

01:00:38
<transcript>: It might not be the blogger's fault. Okay, let's get to it. I got stuff to do. Work to do.

01:00:38
<transcript>: dx

01:00:43
<transcript>: Dx. Monstero. Thank you for the follow. I botched your name. I'm sorry.

01:00:54

01:00:57

01:00:59
<transcript>: Burning mock. I'm forgetting some very obvious people.

01:00:59

cowfacedev: https://tkdodo.eu/blog/

01:01:04

01:01:04
<transcript>: i

<transcript>: I just clicked on that and opened it. The wrong tab.

01:01:12
greatgrievance: https://wesbos.com/blog

01:01:24
<transcript>: Have a question. What's the difference between framework and architecture? Yeah. I mean, I don't get into the framework versus platform versus whatever, but in terms of framework verse architecture, I think I can answer that question. Like architecture.

01:01:24
cowfacedev: the guy behind react query

01:01:31
<transcript>: Is like here are the pieces that we need to accomplish this to build this solution for this problem. So.

01:01:50
<transcript>: We need an api and it's going to have a database. And we're going to have a Q over here. And then these requests are going to hit queue up requests to be done asynchronously we're going to have some asynchronous compute fetching stuff off that queue. Like we're diagramming the high level pieces. But we're not saying like this specific technology necessarily.

01:02:01
<transcript>: But architecture can get into that. You could be saying, we're building a solution on aws and we're going to architect the solution in aws. But frameworks are like, I'm choosing sst to build my application.

01:02:05
<transcript>: Ssc doesn't force an architecture on me.

01:02:07
<transcript>: And most frameworks wouldn't but.

01:02:07
<transcript>: it's like

01:02:14
<transcript>: It's like a practical set of tools for building out what you just architected. Does that make sense? I hope that makes sense.

01:02:20
<transcript>: The guy behind React query. Oh, of course. Tanner. Yeah. Tanner.

01:02:24
<transcript>: Lindeli What's his blog.

01:02:31
adamdotdev: https://medium.com/@tannerlinsley

01:02:52
<transcript>: You get it? Yes.

01:02:52
<transcript>: all right

01:02:53
<transcript>: All right.

01:02:55
<transcript>: Let's build stuff.

01:02:55
<transcript>: let

01:02:59
<transcript>: Let's build stuff. I got to make a new page.

01:02:59
<transcript>: and i was

01:03:02
<transcript>: And I was getting hung up here.

01:03:09
<transcript>: Account Index I need to simplify this page like a lot. We do have a sidebar.

01:03:13
<transcript>: Unless this could just be plugged into, like a layout or something.

01:03:13
<transcript>: oh

01:03:15
<transcript>: Oh, you know what it is? I realized.

01:03:17
mattmancodes: Yeah, sadly too much noise on dev.to that the good ones get drowned out

01:03:24
<transcript>: I actually don't want to model off the home page. There are better pages because the home page has this persistent Sidebar.

01:03:24
<transcript>: i don't think

01:03:30
<transcript>: I don't think we want that. I think we want to go with more like the other pages on the site, which are.

01:03:32
<transcript>: I can't open that one.

01:03:34
cowfacedev: I meant Dominik. the guy currently maintaining react query. He has really good articles on react query

01:03:35
<transcript>: Trending.

01:03:35
<transcript>: like it

01:03:46
<transcript>: Like it collapses, and you've just got this pop out. I think this is probably what I should do. Maybe. I don't know. Actually, I might benefit from having the thing expanded because there's just not that much to show.

01:03:52
<transcript>: We should make that different. That's not good. That's bad. You could say that's bad.

01:03:52
<transcript>: see that

01:03:53
<transcript>: See that.

01:03:53
<transcript>: that

01:03:55
<transcript>: That's bad.

01:04:01

01:04:05
jokestera_e: Does the home page not have the ability to shrink?

01:04:14
<transcript>: Sadly, too much noise on dev, too. Yeah, I guess if you're just going if you're just like, I'm going to go to dev two. This is noisy.

01:04:15
foobarqix: hello

01:04:22
<transcript>: I don't know what to do with this, but if someone uses it for their blog because they just don't want to build another blog thing that makes sense.

<transcript>: Video ad. We got that hidden. Now. That's good.

01:05:11
<transcript>: if you're a

01:05:19
<transcript>: If you're a paid user that's hidden, so maybe we will model off. We're going to model off the home page. I'm going to delete a bunch of this stuff.

01:05:24
<transcript>: Like let's see banner ask bar.

01:05:24
<transcript>: do

01:05:27
<transcript>: Do I need Banner? No, I'm going to get rid of banner.

01:05:30
<transcript>: We're going to get rid of that.

01:05:30

<transcript>: We're going to have the ask bar, I guess.

01:05:42
<transcript>: League Content links. Let's see. Is that okay? That's probably. No, I don't need this.

01:05:47
<transcript>: Lee name? What is this.

01:05:50
<transcript>: Links. I don't need any of this.

01:05:54
<transcript>: If elf.

01:05:58
<transcript>: We won't put video ads on this.

01:06:07
<transcript>: That might feel bad if you're on the account page and you get video ads. Okay. Trending searches. No, don't need that sendgrid sign up for don't need that.

01:06:07

<transcript>: Footer? Is that in? No, that's somewhere else. Where is footer.

01:06:17
<transcript>: Root, view, footer.

01:06:26
<transcript>: Okay, so that's how that works. Render root view footer. Okay, we'll leave that. And then what's all this.

01:08:52
<transcript>: oof

01:08:56
<transcript>: Oof, they are not loving it. Why can't I hit the account page? What's going on.

01:09:04

01:09:05
foobarqix: what's the purpose of statmuse?

01:09:06
<transcript>: Bummer.

01:09:14
gitpush_gitpaid: "ill update the browser after the stream".... more lies

01:09:24
pbertrand_dev: If you have a screen that size you deserve a bad experience Kappa

01:09:26
<transcript>: What's the purpose of stat? Muse? Great question, fubar. It's a sport. So the people who use it every day use it for research. They're journalists, like they're sports journalists. And they do research on Satinwes. Or they're sports better. Or they play fantasy, like daily fantasy. Or just like.

01:09:26
<transcript>: football

01:09:38
<transcript>: Football, fantasy football. Or they're just sports fans. We have some of those, too, but mostly people who are doing research about sports stuff. So what's wrong here? Render account view. Render is undefined.

01:09:40
<transcript>: Interesting.

01:09:47
<transcript>: I feel like I need to register my view somewhere.

01:09:47
<transcript>: like

01:09:53
<transcript>: Like somewhere. All of the views are being registered. Who knows Phoenix? Who knows? Elixir in Phoenix.

01:09:58
<transcript>: Anybody I'll update the browser after the stream.

trivenge: i believe this adam fella was recently hired by statmuse. a new hire Kappa

01:11:01
<transcript>: You guys, here's the question. I made a new view. Like a brand new view. Account view. Okay, there's all these views already, but I'm at a brand new one called Account View. I made a template.

01:11:01
<transcript>: here

01:11:02
<transcript>: Here.

01:11:02
<transcript>: account

01:11:13
<transcript>: Account template Index html. Eex I made a new controller account controller because this is all the ceremony to make a new page a.

01:11:13
<transcript>: dixon

01:11:18
greatgrievance: mmm MVC

01:11:25
<transcript>: Dixon enticement. Oh, thank you for the follow a dixon. I already said ty sweezy. So I'm just trying to figure out, what am I missing? Because it says, like when my template. Let's go down here to my.

01:11:25
<transcript>: template

01:11:26
<transcript>: Template.

01:11:26
<transcript>: where

01:11:29
<transcript>: Where is the template.

01:11:35
<transcript>: Should really pin it. There we go. I should use harpoon, this template. It says it cannot.

01:11:35
greatgrievance: did you route to your controller?

01:11:38
<transcript>: Access the account view.

01:11:40
<transcript>: It's interesting because.

01:11:43
<transcript>: I'm not even rendering anything from the account view.

01:11:44
thatdepressedloser95: what are those .ex files

01:11:46
<transcript>: What's that about.

01:11:50
<transcript>: Where is that error coming from.

01:11:54
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow retrovert.

01:11:54

aj_stuyvenberg: @thatdepressedloser95 elixir

01:12:01
<transcript>: I'm going to catch up with Chat. Here. Jose Valim. Welcome to Chat. Toto what's? Jose Valim.

01:12:02
pbertrand_dev: I gotta go! Have a nice stream

01:12:03
<transcript>: What is that.

01:12:03
<transcript>: it's been a minute

01:12:04
<transcript>: It's been a minute.

01:12:12
<transcript>: Do you work with anyone on sammy? Yeah. We have a team of about ten triv. I believe this Adam Fellow was recently hired by Sat Me as new hire. That's right.

01:12:12
<transcript>: mvc

01:12:22
adrnlnjnky: it has been awhile but do you need to route

01:12:26
<transcript>: Mvc did you route to your controller? Yes. So let's go. Yeah. Let's look at the router. Good call router here's the router and let's just do account. So there it is. Account points to the account controller.

01:12:26
adrnlnjnky: oops day late

01:12:30
<transcript>: Index. I guess I should make sure it's called index.

01:12:38
<transcript>: Account controller.

01:12:38
<transcript>: what

01:12:39
<transcript>: What.

01:12:50
<transcript>: It is account controller. I'm just making sure I'm spelling it right. Yeah. Index. Okay, put. View, client, account view.

01:12:55
<transcript>: Here. Now. Is this the problem? Am I not importing something? I should be importing.

01:12:58
<transcript>: Let's do this.

01:13:00
<transcript>: Let's do.

01:13:03
<transcript>: Put view.

01:13:06
thatdepressedloser95: @thatdepressedloser95 first time I hear about it :D

01:13:10
<transcript>: Client. Let's just look at another one. Like this one? Is it importing something.

01:13:14
<transcript>: No.

01:13:14
<transcript>: what's the

01:13:16
<transcript>: What's the deal here.

01:13:23
<transcript>: Import moss Retail parse use mothra Web Client controller.

01:13:31
<transcript>: If I go back to the account controller, use Phoenix controller.

01:13:37
<transcript>: Is this a problem? That's the problem. I think I just found the problem.

01:13:40
<transcript>: Think I just found the problem.

01:13:48
<transcript>: See a bird trans. Thanks so much for hanging out.

01:13:52
<transcript>: That depressed loser. Welcome to Chat. What are those? Ex files.

01:13:56
<transcript>: Those ex files are elixir files.

01:13:59
<transcript>: Aj already answered you.

01:14:11
<transcript>: See a burchan. I already said that it's been a while, but do you need to route oops daylight? No, you're fine. Yeah. So we're routing it appropriately. Let's see if we have the same error. Could be a new error.

01:14:11
<transcript>: could be

01:14:13
<transcript>: Could be new.

01:14:13
<transcript>: config

01:14:18
<transcript>: Config. It's not available. We did it. We got to a new error. That's good. That's progress.

01:14:28
jokestera_e: hopefully its progress

01:14:29
<transcript>: Please make sure all proper assigns have been set. This is a child template. Ensure assigns are given explicitly by the parent tablet as they are not automatically forwarded.

01:14:29
<transcript>: okay

01:14:30
<transcript>: Okay.

01:14:35
<transcript>: So we're using config, but we're not passing it in.

01:14:35
<transcript>: so

01:14:37
<transcript>: So.

01:14:37
<transcript>: we need to

01:14:38
<transcript>: We need to config.

01:14:42
<transcript>: Something like this.

01:14:42
<transcript>: and i

01:14:44
<transcript>: And I got to figure out.

01:14:53
<transcript>: Where is another? I'm looking for another controller.

01:14:58
<transcript>: Here we go. Mother. Client config. Let's see.

01:15:03
<transcript>: So this is what it looks like.

01:15:06
<transcript>: Player in there.

01:15:09
<transcript>: So config.

01:15:16
<transcript>: I don't need to pass a player.

01:15:20
<transcript>: I don't know what this does actually.

01:15:23
<transcript>: I guess I should look.

01:15:32
<transcript>: I can't go to definition right now. Everything's broken. My lsp is not doing things.

01:15:40
<transcript>: But that's a way I could. So I think the template the problem is the template is using config.

01:15:52
<transcript>: Yeah, right there. Render, ask bar. So let's look at render, ask bar. Let's find where we do that elsewhere. And just see what the config looks like for that particular one.

01:15:52
<transcript>: render

01:15:56
<transcript>: Render ask bar. Let's look in header.

01:16:04
<transcript>: Account index. That's the one I'm working on. How about I just want to pick like a random one.

01:16:07
<transcript>: We'll do the Fantasy Football view.

01:16:07
<transcript>: so

01:16:10
<transcript>: So what does it do.

01:16:16
<transcript>: It's not even what? Oh, that's the that's not the template.

01:16:20
<transcript>: So let's go down to let's go to templates.

01:16:22
<transcript>: Root.

01:16:26
<transcript>: Template Fantasy Football. Here we go.

01:16:29
ptrhvns: Do you prefer not to use tabs in Neovim?

01:16:32
<transcript>: Pig. Okay, so then let's look at the controller.

01:16:32
<transcript>: oh

01:16:34
<transcript>: Oh, man.

01:16:42
<transcript>: We'll see what the config looks like. Client config. New. Oh, color background. Interesting. Should I pass that stuff in? Maybe.

01:16:48
<transcript>: Probably don't need to, though I don't think I need to just config Con params should work.

01:16:50
<transcript>: Should work.

01:16:59
<transcript>: Player controller. Count. Controller. What's wrong, though? Undefined. Function. Oh, I've got to import it.

01:16:59
<transcript>: i got to

01:17:02
<transcript>: I got to import it, I got to import it.

01:17:02
<transcript>: alia

01:17:04
<transcript>: Alias. Mothra.

01:17:06
<transcript>: Web.

01:17:09
<transcript>: No, not what I wanted.

01:17:15
<transcript>: Oh, well, I guess yeah, I can get rid of that and then I can do.

01:17:15
<transcript>: config

01:17:16
<transcript>: Config.

01:17:18
<transcript>: Or client config.

01:17:20
<transcript>: That.

01:17:22
<transcript>: What do we think.

01:17:41
<transcript>: Did they do that here? Client config. Anybody see it? No.

01:17:41
<transcript>: what

01:17:42
<transcript>: What.

01:17:45
<transcript>: Why didn't they have to do it.

01:17:52
<transcript>: Why didn't they have to say something about client config? Oh, is it no.

01:17:54
<transcript>: What.

01:18:04
<transcript>: I expected to see an import here. Client config. Is it just because they imported client somewhere? Is it just because use Mothra web client? Maybe.

01:18:08
<transcript>: So then I shouldn't have to do this.

01:18:12
<transcript>: What's happening? What is happening right now.

01:18:12
<transcript>: is even

01:18:14
<transcript>: Is even happening.

01:18:14
<transcript>: undefined

01:18:17
<transcript>: Undefined function params.

01:18:17
<transcript>: is params

01:18:18
<transcript>: Is params.

01:18:35
<transcript>: Okay. Been a while. You need to write. Okay. We figured that out first time I hear about it. Hopefully it's progress. Hopefully. Do you prefer not to use tabs any of them? I do ptr. I prefer. Here's the thing.

01:18:47
<transcript>: Here's the thing. Cayandra thank you for the follow. I don't know if I already said that, but thank you. Here's the thing about tabs. I got rid of tabs even before I came to new them in vs. Code land because ultimately.

01:18:47
<transcript>: it was just

01:18:54
kayandra: you said it perfect

01:19:05
<transcript>: It was just another thing I had to think about and take care of. Like I had to prune them. I had to make sure they didn't get overrun. I had too many tabs open, and then they become useless because I have everything open. And it's like I have to remember to close the tabs. It was a lot of overhead, a lot of thinking about something that ultimately they're.

01:19:05
<transcript>: other solutions to that

01:19:16
<transcript>: Other solutions to that problem. And in this code base I missed them a little bit because I'm working in, like, Four or Files, but that's harpoon Primetin's harpoon. Fantastic. It does the same thing for me.

01:19:16
<transcript>: keandra

01:19:19
<transcript>: Keandra. I said, It perfect. Welcome to chat.

01:19:19
<transcript>: why

01:19:21
<transcript>: Why is this still upset.

01:19:24
<transcript>: Hey, ma'am, why are we still upset? Here.

01:19:30
<transcript>: Feel like it shouldn't be feel like it's just slow.

01:19:30
<transcript>: let's just see

01:19:32
<transcript>: Let's just see if it works. Now.

01:19:38
<transcript>: Just work. Please. No. Whammy. No. Whammy. No. Whammy. Stop.

01:19:43
<transcript>: We did it.

01:19:47
<transcript>: We made a blank page.

01:19:50
<transcript>: Is that where the search bar goes, though.

01:19:50
<transcript>: the

01:19:55
aj_stuyvenberg: 10/10 blank page

01:19:57
<transcript>: The search bar is not where I expected it. Like if we look at one of these pages, search bars up here, I want it to look like this.

01:20:07
<transcript>: Tint in blank page. We're in business now. Watch out. Can't stop us. I don't think I want the search bar right there. I think I want it to look like.

01:20:07
<transcript>: so after

01:20:13
<transcript>: So after all that, I don't actually want to look like the home template, I want to look like any of these other templates.

01:20:17
<transcript>: This page. Home.

01:20:17
<transcript>: that'll be good

01:20:19
<transcript>: That'll be good. Let's just do that.

01:20:23
<transcript>: We'll make it look like this pitch.

01:20:28
<transcript>: It won't have the persistent thing on the side, but we'll rework that eventually.

01:20:28
<transcript>: that

01:20:30
<transcript>: That's fine.

01:20:41
<transcript>: It's fine. Okay, but at least now I know what my issues were. I don't know why lsp restart. I don't know why that is still an issue. That's kind of a bummer.

01:20:44
<transcript>: But in due time.

01:20:51
<transcript>: In due time.

01:20:58
<transcript>: Okay.

01:21:05
maleero: How’s rebase coming along?

01:21:08
<transcript>: Let's do this.

01:21:08
<transcript>: maliro

01:21:11
<transcript>: Maliro? How's rebates coming.

01:21:18
<transcript>: After this after we put a paywall up for sap News, I'll get some more time on it. I'm pretty like Crunch mode right now.

01:21:25
<transcript>: But dax and I are still very excited. Rebates TV going to be a thing.

01:21:25
<transcript>: just

01:21:29
<transcript>: Just don't know why params, why it's saying params.

01:21:29
<transcript>: i feel like

01:21:30
<transcript>: I feel like.

01:21:34
<transcript>: It's just out of date. It's just stale. That's okay.

01:21:41
<transcript>: Let's go. Let's see index. So let's change this index to look like the about page.

01:21:44
<transcript>: Let's see about.

01:21:47
<transcript>: Boot.

01:21:51
<transcript>: Like this one.

01:21:54
<transcript>: Let's go in here.

01:21:57
<transcript>: Let's just go.

01:22:09
<transcript>: Render root view header header. Okay. So we have to have config and then Div class main.

01:22:17
<transcript>: So this one has like multiple pages. I don't think mine is going to.

01:22:22
<transcript>: For my is not going to have multiple pages. So we're just going to.

01:22:22
<transcript>: do

01:22:23
<transcript>: Do that.

01:22:23
<transcript>: for

01:22:27
<transcript>: For now and then do that is that actually.

01:22:27
<transcript>: is it

01:22:32
<transcript>: Is it actually commenting them out? I don't know. I can't tell.

01:22:35
<transcript>: And we'll just delete them. Let's just delete them.

01:22:43
<transcript>: So this is just kind of a blank page. We need to go into the config. I think I do need to add.

01:22:45
<transcript>: Something.

01:22:49
<transcript>: Let's see to the view.

01:22:49
<transcript>: okay

01:22:51
<transcript>: Okay, I need to pin these.

01:22:51
<transcript>: need

01:22:56
<transcript>: Need to use my powers here. Let's do.

01:23:03
<transcript>: Let's do this. Let's delete all these.

01:23:10
<transcript>: I'm going to leave that one because I actually do need that. So let's pin this file right here.

01:23:10
<transcript>: let's see

01:23:12
<transcript>: Let's see like that.

01:23:16
<transcript>: And then let's pin the view.

01:23:16
<transcript>: so

01:23:19
<transcript>: So account view.

01:23:22
<transcript>: And that.

01:23:22
<transcript>: okay

01:23:28
<transcript>: Okay. I need to add the color thing. I think let's go to the about view.

01:23:31
<transcript>: The config here.

01:23:31
<transcript>: oh

01:23:33
<transcript>: Oh. What? No.

01:23:35
<transcript>: Config, what.

01:23:37
<transcript>: Oh, it's the.

01:23:37
<transcript>: about

01:23:40
<transcript>: About controller.

01:23:42
<transcript>: About.

01:23:42
<transcript>: controller

01:23:44
<transcript>: Controller.

01:23:44
<transcript>: yeah

01:23:48
<transcript>: Yeah. In here. Config. There it is. Color background. Hex okay.

01:23:55
<transcript>: Well, let's see. I can just go like that. There it is. No, that one.

01:23:57
<transcript>: Is this account view? Yes.

01:23:57
<transcript>: conf

01:23:59
<transcript>: Config.

01:24:07
<transcript>: Account View right? Oh, Account Controller, Account controller.

01:24:09
<transcript>: Is that in here.

01:24:09
<transcript>: should

01:24:11
<transcript>: Should be.

01:24:20
<transcript>: Now it is. So we got the account controller, the account view, the account template. Okay. So here's where.

01:24:24
<transcript>: I'm going to. No, that's not where I'm going to do it.

01:24:29
<transcript>: Like this, I guess. Was it just an object inside.

01:24:38
<transcript>: Let's go back and find it. Yeah. Oh, no, it's just like those are additional params. Okay.

01:24:38
<transcript>: so not

01:24:39
<transcript>: So not an object.

01:24:39
<transcript>: where was that

01:24:41
<transcript>: Where was that? Right here.

01:24:45
<transcript>: Click that.

01:24:52
<transcript>: Cool. It still doesn't like params. It's so silly. Like, Listen, params is a thing.

01:24:52
<transcript>: it used

01:24:54
<transcript>: It used to not be a thing.

01:24:54
<transcript>: but then

01:25:00
<transcript>: But then I got rid of the thing. I got rid of the underscore. It's real. Okay.

01:25:02
<transcript>: Lsp.

01:25:04
<transcript>: Do with it.

01:25:14
<transcript>: Okay. Has anyone pasted any tweets? Can we do Twitter time soon? I'd like to look at Twitter or something. I've done a little too much thinking. I need a little more talking and hanging out.

01:25:23
<transcript>: Paste tweets in my chat, please.

01:25:35
<transcript>: Okay, there we go. Account. Look at it now. The Elephant of Sports and Financial information.

01:25:41
<transcript>: Now I can just add.

01:25:44
<transcript>: All the functionality down here.

01:26:00
<transcript>: Okay.

01:26:31
<transcript>: Do I want to mock this up or just start building? I could just start building.

01:26:35
<transcript>: I generally do.

01:26:46
<transcript>: Let's copy.

01:26:46
<transcript>: some

01:26:46
<transcript>: Some.

01:26:49
<transcript>: Of this markup.

01:26:53
<transcript>: All of this markup. Maybe.

01:27:09
<transcript>: What was that one in there for.

01:27:16
<transcript>: What was that? Main layout? Text. White background, primary. Oh, Wait, what.

01:27:20
<transcript>: Is this container.

01:27:24
<transcript>: What purpose does it serve in the about page.

01:27:32
<transcript>: Is that where these were? Maybe. Oh, yeah, it's where the tab control was. Okay.

01:27:32
<transcript>: don't

01:27:34
<transcript>: Don't need it.

01:27:40
<transcript>: Client about path.

01:27:44
<transcript>: We don't need any of this stuff.

01:27:44
<transcript>: and i wish

01:27:48
<transcript>: And I wish I get my tree sitter to work in elixir templates.

01:27:52
<transcript>: That'd be nice.

01:28:02
gitpush_gitpaid: guy is so rich he got a tree sitter

01:28:14
maleero: I’m feeling lucky

01:28:17
<transcript>: It just occurred to me like, Chad is really quiet and I'm actually needing to get a lot of stuff done. Guy so rich you got treated her. Maybe I'm just going to like, I might just do some asmr. How do you all feel about that? I don't have to always talk. Maybe I just don't externally process.

01:28:17
<transcript>: you guys just want to

01:28:22
<transcript>: You guys just want to watch me. I'll just type and work.

01:28:23

01:30:09
<transcript>: I can't welcome you all to chat because you're all too fast. They are Italian hands. That's what these are. Oh, is it not snapping? It's just doing this.

01:30:12
mono_nz: ok sweet, yeah im doing  football (soccer) app, looking for a better api

01:30:13
<transcript>: I'm going to do my best Italian impersonation.

01:30:19
<transcript>: Hello sushi.

01:30:27
<transcript>: I'm doing football soccer app looking for a better api. So mono we use Sport radar for the real time stuff.

01:30:31
<transcript>: And then we have like a big, comprehensive.

01:30:31
<transcript>: reference

01:30:33
<transcript>: Reference database.

01:30:45
<transcript>: But are you saying you're looking for a better api like you were hoping Sam use was because we don't have an official api yet. We've talked about it, but today it's just a consumer facing product.

01:30:46
<transcript>: Okay.

01:30:51
<transcript>: Nicoleus, thank you for the follow. I'm going to get back to it.

01:31:01
plusquare: everythings an API when u webscrape

01:31:03
<transcript>: May or may not interact a lot. I haven't decided yet. It'll be the first stream ever. If I don't interact, it'll be the first time I've ever just sat here and worked and let you all listen to my keyboard and my music.

01:31:03
<transcript>: and

01:31:05
<transcript>: And look at the side of my face.

01:31:07
goodgrandpaa: @plusquare LUL

01:31:08
<transcript>: I don't know. We'll just see how it goes.

01:31:08
<transcript>: we'll see

01:31:11
mattmancodes: it would be a bit strange

01:31:14
<transcript>: We'll see if Chad is talking a lot. I'll talk a lot, too, because I always do.

01:31:14
<transcript>: okay

01:31:25
<transcript>: Okay, here you go. You guys are talking. Okay? Everything's an api when you web scrape it's true. Plus, it would be a bit strange. It would be right. It would just feel funny for me.

01:31:25
<transcript>: i

01:31:28
<transcript>: I don't know how to act if I'm not talking constantly.

01:31:28
<transcript>: all i

01:31:30
<transcript>: All I know.

01:31:33
<transcript>: All this stuff.

01:31:33
<transcript>: going

01:31:35
<transcript>: Going away.

01:31:42
<transcript>: Okay.

01:31:49
<transcript>: No, this is going way too. All of this is going away. What did I copy this for? What was the point of this.

01:31:53
<transcript>: About us. I guess that might be useful.

01:31:57
<transcript>: Video wrapper? No.

01:31:57
<transcript>: not this

01:31:58
<transcript>: Not this either.

01:31:59
mono_nz: i use api-sports atm. but its a bit delayed. so keen to add cricket to my app. but i think i need to invest in a better api

01:32:04
<transcript>: Okay.

01:32:06
<transcript>: What that looks like.

01:32:10
<transcript>: Count.

01:32:13
plusquare: u guys pay liscencing fees for stats or do you just have a provider?

01:32:18
<transcript>: I use API Sports at the moment, but it's a bit delayed, so candid add cricut to my app, but I think I need to invest in a better API.

01:32:18
<transcript>: is this it

01:32:21
<transcript>: Is this it? Did I go to account? No.

01:32:21
<transcript>: let's go

01:32:23
<transcript>: Let's go here.

01:32:24
<transcript>: Account.

01:32:35
plusquare: *provider API

01:32:39
<transcript>: There we go. Okay, so I can just start replacing this with the actual functionality. You guys pay licensees for sasser to you just have a provider plus. So we pay sport radar for real time, like in season real time data. But then.

01:32:39
<transcript>: we also just

01:32:53
goodgrandpaa: !data

01:32:53
fossabot: StatMuse gets real-time data from SportRadar, but all the historical data was collected by Justin Kubatko, creator of Basketball-Reference.com, who worked as the lead statistician for Statmuse for several years. Read more here: https://www.statmuse.com/product/data

01:32:54
<transcript>: We also just have like a big, comprehensive historical database that we had a statistician named Justin Cabacco. He created Basketball Reference. He worked for Sat muse for like five years. And we license his data in perpetuity. So forever.

01:32:54
<transcript>: forever

01:32:55
<transcript>: Forever.

01:33:06
<transcript>: Oh, there you go. There's just a command for it. I could have just done that. That would have been good. Okay, so what does this page need to do? We need to have.

01:33:06
<transcript>: where you can

01:33:08
<transcript>: Where you can change your email address.

01:33:08
<transcript>: and

01:33:10
<transcript>: And we need to have.

01:33:12
<transcript>: Where.

01:33:12
<transcript>: you can

01:33:15
<transcript>: You can manage your stripe account.

01:33:15
<transcript>: so

01:33:18
<transcript>: So we're going to have to do some stuff with the stripe API.

01:33:21
mono_nz: we arent that big on american sports.. yet. hopefully soon

01:33:23
<transcript>: Was there something else? I feel like there was something else supposed to be able to do.

01:33:25
goodgrandpaa: Can users already log in or is this a new implementation?

01:33:30
<transcript>: Email us account deletion so you got to be able to delete your account.

01:33:33
<transcript>: How are we going to do that? Okay, we'll figure it out.

01:33:40
<transcript>: We aren't that big on American Sports yet. Hopefully soon. Yeah. Mono. I'd love to know what you're building. Keep me posted.

01:33:44
mono_nz: keen to see if you add an api though

01:33:46
<transcript>: Fu Bar thank you for the follow. I appreciate that. Can users already log in, or is this a new implementation.

01:33:54
<transcript>: There's some backdoors. So all the off stuff was already in place. We just had pulled it out long ago.

01:33:54
<transcript>: early

01:33:58
<transcript>: Early in sat music's history before we really had a lot of users.

01:33:58
<transcript>: we put

01:34:15
mono_nz: would def use it for my app

01:34:15
<transcript>: We put out some social stuff where you could pin queries, like, Twitter, but sports information, and you could follow people and you could like, their stuff. We did all that. And then we just pulled it all out because we were like, I don't know. Is that where we want to go? But all of it was still there. So we just kind of resurfaced.

01:34:16
goodgrandpaa: Gotcha!

01:34:19
<transcript>: And now you've got this login thing.

01:34:23
<transcript>: That is just kind of already been there. We just didn't use it.

01:34:27
goodgrandpaa: 20?! Kappa

01:34:32
<transcript>: Keen to see if I add an api. Yeah. We've talked about it. So we do have some people that use status.

01:34:32
<transcript>: clearly

01:34:36
<transcript>: Clearly in an api capacity. They're using it like thousands of times.

01:34:36
<transcript>: they're hitting

01:34:44
mono_nz: also, hows the kotlin/swift app going>

01:34:57
<transcript>: They're hitting thousands of queries a month. We know that those people aren't just typing it in. They're probably hitting us programmatically. So we want to meet those use cases and say, like, how do you need to use stamus? And what kind of an api would you like? And then we will build something eventually. We just haven't yet. How's the Colin Swift app going? Mono. We've just been pretty busy on stat muse last couple of weeks. So.

01:34:57
<transcript>: indax has had a lot of

01:35:00
goodgrandpaa: wait, rebase is in kotlin?!

01:35:01
<transcript>: Indax has had a lot of stuff going on. He's speaking at React Miami today.

01:35:01
<transcript>: we've just been pretty busy

<transcript>: I don't know why it always surprised me that new Wherever is named after an existing place. Yeah, seriously, your overlay doesn't update when your twitch stream does. I'm guessing you started this stream by watching dax and then moved forward to stripe the title. The title should still just be the same, right? I could update the topic, which is topic.
