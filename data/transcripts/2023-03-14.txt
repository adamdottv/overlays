00:12:02
<transcript>: So I'll.

00:12:10
<transcript>: from

00:12:19
<transcript>: From a world renowned sports that edition just in Queco. He created basketball reference. He worked at Statmen for five or six years.

00:12:19
<transcript>: and

00:12:22
<transcript>: And that's where we got the data. And then.

00:12:34
<transcript>: The live data we just licensed from one of the live sports data providers. I don't remember. And then the sketches of the players we've employed, someone named Michael Waljack. I do have a command for this one.

00:12:35
adamdotdev: !players

00:12:35
fossabot: The player illustrations on statmuse.com are illustrated by the magnificent Michael Walchalk (https://www.michaelwalchalkdesign.com/).

00:12:36
<transcript>: Players.

00:12:45
<transcript>: So they're illustrated by a man named Michael Waltzhock. He's worked at Statmes for seven years. Something like that.

00:12:45
<transcript>: and he

00:12:47
<transcript>: And he just illustrates players.

00:12:47

<transcript>: well not all day

00:12:52
sathyabhat: doing well! will be off for dinner soon

00:12:55
<transcript>: Well, not all day. He has a good work, life balance. But the time that he's working, he's illustrating athletes.

00:12:55
<transcript>: we've got

alalfakawma: sick! Looks like it would be a really hefty job to keep illutrating players everyday.

00:13:07
<transcript>: It's so weird to me still.

00:13:07
<transcript>: that

00:13:08
<transcript>: That.

00:13:15
<transcript>: The Internet allows us to interact like I just woke up. You're just getting ready to eat dinner.

00:13:16
<transcript>: have a conversation

00:13:19

00:13:59
<transcript>: Tom literally me every day.

00:14:12
filippyrek: What's up 👋

00:14:19
<transcript>: Oh, sick. Looks like it would be a really hefty job. You keep illustrating players every day. Yeah. So over the years, like, the first few years is like we would check in. I remember the first year, it was just kind of like months in, like checking on him. You sure you enjoy this, right? Like, this is cool. You like, just doing this every day. And he says he loved it. And seven years later, he still said.

00:14:19
<transcript>: he loves

00:14:26
<transcript>: He loves it so I don't think he would have stuck with it if he didn't. I think he would have left a long time ago. Tom, thanks so much for that. Follow.

00:14:26
<transcript>: philip

00:14:29
<transcript>: Philip, what's up? Welcome to chat.

00:14:29
<transcript>: how are you

00:14:30
<transcript>: How are you.

00:14:33
<transcript>: Yeah, he.

00:14:33
<transcript>: he really

00:14:38
<transcript>: He really does enjoy. And now Statme's has something like, what is the final name.

00:14:43
<transcript>: We might have like 60 players illustrated. Let's see.

00:14:46
<transcript>: Not sure exactly.

00:14:51
<transcript>: To find out.

00:14:51
<transcript>: we have

00:14:53
<transcript>: We have like a.

00:14:53
<transcript>: some

00:14:56
<transcript>: Some stuff about let's see.

00:14:59
<transcript>: Nope. That's not it.

00:14:59
<transcript>: i know

00:15:03
<transcript>: I know we have something about our about page maybe.

00:15:15
<transcript>: Oh, that's so old. That that's so old. So our About Page says three 50 original illustrations. It's probably double that now. It also says 45 million plus searches.

00:15:15
<transcript>: we did

00:15:17
<transcript>: We did.

00:15:17
<transcript>: we did like

00:15:25
<transcript>: We did like we do like 2 million searches a day now. So that number is way off. I think like in January alone, we did over.

00:15:25
<transcript>: think we did

00:15:28
<transcript>: Think we did over 50 million searches in January.

00:15:28
<transcript>: so yeah

00:15:30
<transcript>: So Yeah.

00:15:39
<transcript>: That page needs to be updated. I think it's like 6000 or 70 stuff like that. He's illustrated a whole lot of players. It's a bunch of them.

00:15:44
<transcript>: So that's how we get the illustrations for statues. Calm.

00:15:47
<transcript>: Thank you for the question.

00:15:47
<transcript>: it's amazing

00:15:55
<transcript>: It's amazing how many people have popped into my chat. The second go around with streaming. Now that I'm working on Statmeues and ask that question, that's always the first question.

00:15:59
<transcript>: Where do the player pictures come from.

00:16:10
<transcript>: Oh, do we not have a single one of my mods here? I think this daylight Savings thing.

00:16:13
alalfakawma: !keyboard

00:16:14
fossabot: Adam uses a custom Mode Eighty mechanical keyboard, and has a collection of other Mode keyboards!

00:16:17
<transcript>: Think it's it's throwing me a little bit. I think it's throw it makes me an hour earlier, right.

00:16:17
<transcript>: i think it makes

00:16:21
<transcript>: I think it makes me an hour earlier. For everyone. It's not on daylight Savings time.

00:16:21
<transcript>: which is unfortun

00:16:23
<transcript>: Which is unfortunate.

00:16:24
kryotoboi: Updating about page is such a task. Our Team page is still showing employees back from 2018, everyone who has left is still there 😅

00:16:25
tayloreddev: until the end of march for me

00:16:26
<transcript>: Field an hour earlier to me.

00:16:26
<transcript>: it is an

00:16:34
<transcript>: It is an hour earlier to me. Yeah, this is like 05:00 A.m. For me instead of 06:00 a.m.. It definitely feels it.

00:16:42
<transcript>: Updating about things. Such a task. Our team page is still showing employees that from 2018 everyone is left is still there. That's funny.

00:16:59
<transcript>: Till the end of March for you, Taylor, and then you'll be moving forward as well. Is anyone else any other countries? Are they talking about getting rid of daylight Savings because we're talking about or staying on it permanently. Like we're talking about that in the US. I don't know.

00:17:02
<transcript>: If it has Trackion if that's gonna happen.

00:17:07
daglee: I think every country is doing it.

00:17:11
tayloreddev: UK talks about this every year i feel and nothing comes of it

00:17:13
<transcript>: But there's definitely talk of it. And that would be cool. I don't care which one. I don't care if we stay on standard time or daylight time. I just I don't want to keep going back and forth.

00:17:13
<transcript>: i think every

00:17:17
<transcript>: I think every country is doing it like talking about getting rid of it.

00:17:17
tom1269_: Canada if US do it first

00:17:21
<transcript>: Uk talks about this every year. I feel and nothing comes of it, but.

00:17:24
<transcript>: Canada.

00:17:24
<transcript>: if

00:17:26
<transcript>: If us don't.

00:17:26
<transcript>: okay

00:17:27
<transcript>: Okay.

00:17:27
<transcript>: well that would make

00:17:28
mightycore1: The EU had the discussion but the countries have different opinions

00:17:29
<transcript>: Well, that would make sense since we touch.

00:17:31
<transcript>: We touch each other.

00:17:31
<transcript>: the us

00:17:33
<transcript>: The US and Canada.

00:17:34
alalfakawma: !headphone

00:17:38
alalfakawma: !headphones

00:17:39
<transcript>: Liongdev thanks so much to follow the EU had the discussion with the countries have different opinions.

00:17:39
<transcript>: that sounds

00:17:43
<transcript>: That sounds like you could use that sentence for a lot of things.

00:17:51
<transcript>: I don't know a lot about EU politics. That's like that sentence could broadly apply to basically everything in the EU. We had a discussion, but the kind.

00:17:51
kryotoboi: The Republic of Coders United is planning to get rid if daylight altogether so people are most productive at all times

00:18:05
<transcript>: I don't think I have the headphones command. I hit phones or syncheizer HD 650s xc St. Thanks. No chat follow. I appreciate that. Follow very early in the morning.

00:18:05
<transcript>: it's

00:18:09
<transcript>: It's early. Can you tell do my eyes look tired? Because I feel like.

00:18:09
<transcript>: i should still

00:18:10
<transcript>: I should still be sleeping.

00:18:10
<transcript>: which is we

00:18:15
<transcript>: Which is weird because I get up earlier than this even before daylight savings.

00:18:23
<transcript>: But something about streaming an hour earlier just feels like my voice is not ready for it. My eyes aren't ready for the bright lights.

00:18:31
<transcript>: The Republic of coders United is planning to get rid of daylight saving or daylight altogether so people are most productive at all times.

00:18:39
tayloreddev: A world without DST as a software dev sounds good, i've had so many DST bugs in my time.

00:18:39
<transcript>: No daylight which is want to be indoors. It's funny my office. I have my blind clothes all the time like it's always.

00:18:39
<transcript>: dark in here

00:18:42
tom1269_: Sun's just coming out on your forehead.

00:18:43
<transcript>: Dark in here. It's not that I want it dark. It said, I want to be able to control light.

00:18:43
<transcript>: and

00:18:43
xvsaint: pulling an all nighter today LUL

00:18:44
fragaverage: hi hi hi hi

00:18:45
<transcript>: And so I never let the sunlight in.

00:18:46
fragaverage: am i alte

00:18:47
fragaverage: late*

00:19:06
<transcript>: World without DST as a software device. Sounds good. I've had so many DST bugs my time. Oh, no joke, stat. Muse. Dst bug it's there. Every year we saw him fixed it and it just lasts for like, an hour, I think. And then something, maybe at the library's update. I don't know. It doesn't last for very long.

00:19:06
<transcript>: but

00:19:16
<transcript>: But we have a bug in status if we haven't fixed it this year because we're just replacing that whole thing with a new we're rewriting it so.

00:19:16
<transcript>: it'd be funny

00:19:21
<transcript>: It'd be funny if I brought the DataLight savings bug over into the rewrite.

00:19:28
<transcript>: Tom's Sons. Suns just coming out on your forehead. Yeah, exactly. These lights are like the Sun.

00:19:39
<transcript>: Xd St. Welcome to Check. Pulling an allnighter today. You're staying up all night? Frag is here. Am I late? You're just a little late. It's okay. I'm early. Cuz daylight savings.

00:19:39
<transcript>: you

00:19:43
<transcript>: You have a head daylight Savings yet in your country have you.

00:19:46
<transcript>: Are You're in Britain.

00:19:46
<transcript>: i should

00:19:50
daglee: My friend works during dst, sitting in a server room and restarting all servers that can't handle dst correctly.

00:19:53
<transcript>: I should start saying the UK, because that's bigger target you're in the UK. Frag. Right.

00:20:01
<transcript>: My friend works during daily life savings times sitting in a server room and restarting all servers that can't handle DSC.

00:20:03
<transcript>: Sounds awful.

00:20:05
fragaverage: nope, and it confuses me, because EST should ALWAYS be -5 from us, but right now its -4 LUL   Yeah UK time

00:20:06
<transcript>: That sounds really not fun.

00:20:15
<transcript>: Alright. We're just gonna get straight to it. Nope. And it confuses me because est should always be minus five from us. But right now it's minus four. Yeah.

00:20:17
<transcript>: It's confusing.

00:20:17
<transcript>: we should get rid

00:20:19
<transcript>: We should get rid of it.

00:20:19
<transcript>: we should

00:20:21
<transcript>: We should all get rid of it.

00:20:27
<transcript>: All right.

00:20:30
<transcript>: Well, we gotta go on here.

00:20:30
<transcript>: we're gonna finish

00:20:33
<transcript>: We're gonna finish this this game page.

00:20:33
<transcript>: which

00:20:37
sj_se: yoyo

00:20:40
<transcript>: Which is a tall task because we've only done MBA team sets still got to do player stats.

00:20:40
<transcript>: so i think

00:20:42
<transcript>: So I think I'm gonna do with a.

00:20:42
<transcript>: query

00:20:44
<transcript>: Query. Param.

00:20:47
<transcript>: Yo? Sj's here.

00:20:54
<transcript>: Okay. So we got everything.

00:20:54
<transcript>: on this

00:20:56
<transcript>: On this page.

00:20:57
<transcript>: For the ad.

00:20:57
<transcript>: done

00:21:07
<transcript>: Done. An Explorer looks awful, but we're okay with it for now, because it just needs to be redone. Better. That's really bad. The way it shifts over here.

00:21:11
<transcript>: Well, that's okay.

00:21:21
sj_se: how many non black t shirts do you own? my guess is none

00:21:22
<transcript>: Here we go. We're going to make this a query param. Player stats is now going to be a query param. Why am I? It feels like I'm allergic to.

00:21:22
<transcript>: any kind of client

00:21:25
<transcript>: Any kind of client side in our activity.

00:21:25
<transcript>: i shouldn't

00:21:30
<transcript>: I shouldn't be right? Should this just be some client side interactivity? Should we have the view rated.

00:21:33
<transcript>: Just have a client side tab. Here.

00:21:36
<transcript>: Maybe that's better.

00:21:36
<transcript>: is that better

00:21:37
<transcript>: Is that better.

00:21:44
<transcript>: I don't want to have a blind spot here. Is it done. The server render the player stats page so on the current app.

00:21:50
<transcript>: In production. This is like React. And so this is all just a client side thing.

00:21:50
<transcript>: there's a nice little

00:21:52
<transcript>: There's a nice little animation.

00:22:02
<transcript>: Should I do the same thing? Should I just make this client side? I don't know. It feels like having this data server side.

00:22:02
<transcript>: could be helpful

00:22:02
daglee: If we had 13 months, every month would be 28 days, which is exactly 4 weeks, then you could make new years a special day not a part of normal months. The chance of changing to this: 0%.

00:22:04
<transcript>: Could be helpful, but maybe not.

00:22:09
<transcript>: How many Non Black tshirts do you own? My guess is none.

00:22:09
<transcript>: so

00:22:15
<transcript>: So SJ I only stream with these shirts on but I don't really wear them outside of being.

00:22:15
<transcript>: on camera

00:22:17
<transcript>: On camera.

00:22:17
<transcript>: so

00:22:19
<transcript>: So I do actually have other shirts.

00:22:19
<transcript>: probably as many

00:22:22
<transcript>: Probably as many other shirts as I do. Black shirts.

00:22:25
<transcript>: But for like working.

00:22:25
<transcript>: i just put

00:22:28
<transcript>: I just put on a black shirt and I turn on the camera.

00:22:41
<transcript>: Daglie. If we had 13 months, every month would be 28 days, which is exactly four weeks. Then you can make New Year's a special day, not a part of normal months. The chance of changing this is zero. Yeah, I didn't know that, though.

00:22:41
<transcript>: you told me

00:22:43
<transcript>: You told me 13 months.

00:22:51
<transcript>: So if you take twelve months in just the difference of one or two days each. Wow. Yeah. So 13 months would be 28 days each.

00:22:56
<transcript>: Exactly four weeks. That's so much better.

00:22:56
<transcript>: wow

00:22:57
daglee: 13*28 = 354

00:22:58
<transcript>: Wow, that's so much better.

00:23:06
<transcript>: Wait 13 times 28 is 354. What happens to the other two days.

00:23:11
<transcript>: Oh, New Year's would be a special day.

00:23:11
<transcript>: three hundred and fifty

00:23:14
<transcript>: 356 days a year. But what about the other day.

00:23:16
daglee: 364*

00:23:22
<transcript>: What about the other day, dagley? Oh, yeah. 364. Okay.

00:23:32
<transcript>: I was convinced there was 356 days in the year. So that's where I'm at 364. Okay, so there's only one day. And it's New Year's. That's actually super cool.

00:23:39
<transcript>: Has this been discussed? I mean, surely that would never happen because that would destroy basically all software.

00:23:44
<transcript>: We would basically have to start over as a civilization.

00:23:44
sj_se: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fixed_Calendar#Disadvantages

00:23:46
<transcript>: But, man, that'd be cool.

00:23:48
sj_se: it has

00:23:49
<transcript>: International Fixed calendar.

00:23:51
<transcript>: Disadvantages.

00:23:58
<transcript>: I mean one disadvantage is literally the apocalypse.

00:23:58
<transcript>: it would

00:24:02
<transcript>: It would seriously. It would break everything right.

00:24:05
<transcript>: What Tab did that open in.

00:24:08
<transcript>: Let's try this again.

00:24:20
<transcript>: Straight again, this advantage is well. Each quarter would be equal in length. 13 weeks. 13 is a prime number, placing all activities currently done on a quarterly basis out of alignment with the months.

00:24:20
<transcript>: i

00:24:22
<transcript>: I don't understand. That.

00:24:23
tom1269_: It would make life of devs easier. So NO

00:24:31
<transcript>: What is it being a prime number? I'm so confused. Each quarter would be 13 weeks. All activity is done on a quarterly basis.

00:24:31
<transcript>: would be out

00:24:34
<transcript>: Would be out of alignment with the months.

00:24:36
<transcript>: Would they have to be.

<transcript>: Oh, oh, how would that work.

00:24:58
<transcript>: Would your birth now.

00:25:01
<transcript>: Always be on the same day of the week.

00:25:01
<transcript>: we probably

00:25:01
tom1269_: LUL

00:25:06
<transcript>: We probably for public holidays that was followed nonworking days on the new system.

00:25:13
<transcript>: Okay. So it's funny that this is actually has like people have actually had to form.

00:25:13
<transcript>: count

00:25:18
<transcript>: Counterarguments. It's been to discuss that's crazy. I love it though.

00:25:18
<transcript>: leap

00:25:21
daglee: It's harder to split the year in 4 parts with 13 months.

00:25:23
<transcript>: Leap Day in June on Leap Years or Year Day in December.

00:25:29
<transcript>: So there is still the leap problem. I guess 365 still has the leap problem.

00:25:39
<transcript>: It's really trippy. It messes with your brain really bad. What would be the extra they've already named it.

00:25:39
<transcript>: the extra

00:25:41
<transcript>: The extra month would be called Saul.

00:25:44
<transcript>: Hi.

00:25:47
<transcript>: Interesting.

00:25:48
mehulsharmamat: oh oh! let me link the perfect video for this problem

00:25:49
<transcript>: Hello, mayhu.

00:25:53
<transcript>: It would make life of desirous. So no.

00:26:05
<transcript>: Did Adam just confirm that software will end will be the end of human civilization. I mean, if if we change to this calendar all over the globe, just every piece of software it would break, right.

00:26:07
<transcript>: There's no way.

00:26:07
<transcript>: we already

00:26:13
<transcript>: We already break on like Leap Ear and daylight Savings. Can you imagine if we changed literally the entire calendar.

00:26:13
<transcript>: oof

00:26:15
<transcript>: Oof.

00:26:22
<transcript>: Harder to split the year in four parts with 13 months. Okay. I see.

00:26:22
<transcript>: i guess

00:26:24
<transcript>: I guess I see.

00:26:30
<transcript>: Okay.

00:26:39
<transcript>: So someone tell me. I need someone to make this decision for me. I feel like if dax was here, he would have a very strong opinion about this. Should I do this.

00:26:39
<transcript>: as cl

00:26:40
xvsaint: woah this camera work is insane what

00:26:40
<transcript>: As client side.

00:26:44
<transcript>: Should I just make these tabs.

00:26:44
<transcript>: all like

00:26:47
<transcript>: All like a client side app.

00:26:47
<transcript>: so i have all

00:26:49
fragaverage: The extra month has 4 equal parts though, so its not really harder

00:26:53
<transcript>: So I have all I mean, all the data is there already on the client to render all this stuff. Maybe that's the answer.

00:27:01
<transcript>: Because like we already have all the data to render the player stats for each team. Should I just bite the bullet and make it climb side.

00:27:01
<transcript>: i guess

00:27:07
<transcript>: I guess what do I lose if I do it? Clientside? Do I lose anything? I guess from, like a.

00:27:16
<transcript>: From like a seo perspective, are we missing out on having all this data available as a static page to crawlers.

00:27:26
<transcript>: Can't decide. I guess there's also the fact that it's currently client side routed. Thanks so much for Follow dex cops.

00:27:30
<transcript>: I guess, Yeah.

00:27:38
<transcript>: It's currently client side so that should favor client side as well. I feel like everything's pointing toward I should do it client side.

00:27:38
<transcript>: i

00:27:46
<transcript>: I just don't want to because, like, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna have to create a tab component? Do I have to introduce.

00:27:46
<transcript>: like a framework

00:27:48
<transcript>: Like a framework for that.

00:27:48
<transcript>: or can i

00:27:52
<transcript>: Or can I do it in vanilla? Js? Let's see, vanilla. Let's just see what our options are.

00:27:56
<transcript>: Vanilla js tab component.

00:27:58
<transcript>: Sign of a component just.

00:27:58
<transcript>: scratch

00:28:00
<transcript>: Scratch, let's see.

00:28:02
dexkopf: This production quality is actually insane. What the heck, love it :D HeyGuys

00:28:03
<transcript>: What's vanilla framework.

00:28:15
<transcript>: Dex Cop, welcome to Chat. This production quality is actually insane. What the heck? Love it. Yeah, that's kind of like it's the only thing I got going for me, you know.

00:28:15
<transcript>: i made

00:28:18
<transcript>: I made a very slick production.

00:28:18
<transcript>: and when

00:28:26
<transcript>: And when you're not very smart or good at programming and you stream programming, that's what you do. You just make a really good production.

00:28:26
<transcript>: the

00:28:32
<transcript>: The extra month has four equal parts, though, so it's not really harder. Yeah. I'm struggling to wrap my head around it, but it doesn't seem like.

00:28:32
<transcript>: a quarter thing would

00:28:36
<transcript>: A quarter thing would be that big an issue, but I don't know what I missed.

00:28:52
<transcript>: Okay. So what are tiny and simple? Here we go. Vanilla javascript tabs. That's a long time ago. I guess those vanilla js. So maybe that's fine.

00:28:52
<transcript>: we'll see

00:28:53
<transcript>: We'll see a demo.

00:29:01
mehulsharmamat: adam how do you decide on if to work on a project or not? just do it, evaluate monetarily? how?

00:29:03
<transcript>: Seems reasonable and I guess with the markup have all the data in it it would already have all the data in it.

00:29:03
<transcript>: so this might be

00:29:06
<transcript>: So this might be fine. Let's just do it. Client side.

00:29:06
<transcript>: then i have to introduce

00:29:08
<transcript>: Then I have to introduce all these query params and stuff.

00:29:08
<transcript>: mayhel adam

00:29:19
<transcript>: Mayhel. Adam, how do you decide on if to work on a project or not just do it evaluate monetarily how this is a great question, Mayheal, because it's something I'm soulsearching right now.

00:29:19
<transcript>: i just close

00:29:24
<transcript>: I just close down public dev, which is a side project I spent a lot of time on.

00:29:33
<transcript>: I mean, I feel like three months building it, but it's like been out there for almost a year, like it's been a mental weight that I've carried.

00:29:38
<transcript>: And I've once worked on a project. A side project for like.

00:29:44
<transcript>: 18 months. I think a year and a half, and I never even shift it. So I feel like I'm a terrible person to ask.

00:29:51
<transcript>: How to know what you should work on. Here's. What dax once said recently, when I was just kind of like.

00:30:02
<transcript>: Expressing all of this and how upsetting it is to me. He said that there's probably something to just going with your intuition. Like when you're really excited to work on something, work on it.

00:30:02
<transcript>: like

00:30:05
<transcript>: Like if that changes.

00:30:05
<transcript>: then

00:30:11
<transcript>: Then reevaluate work on something you're excited about, but, like, just going with your desire to work on something.

00:30:15
mehulsharmamat: what if my intuition is broken and it says work on 4 at once

00:30:17
<transcript>: Dax is kind of making the argument that that's a good way to do it.

00:30:17
<transcript>: and i think

00:30:24
<transcript>: And I think it makes sense you get to enjoy life a lot more because I much prefer working on project that I'm just so excited to wake up and work on.

00:30:24
<transcript>: and

00:30:26
<transcript>: And if I have that.

00:30:26
<transcript>: that's

00:30:30
<transcript>: That's probably more important to me than any other factors.

00:30:36
<transcript>: As long as I'm like making a living and I'm happy, I'm not like.

00:30:36
<transcript>: starving artists

00:30:37
<transcript>: Starving artists.

00:30:38
kryotoboi: I did that now I am stuck in a dead end job NotLikeThis

00:30:40
mehulsharmamat: but yeah that's a good advice! since side projects arent "work" so not a good idea to NOT have your interests in them

00:30:42
<transcript>: What if my intuition is broken? It says work on four at once. The mind does too.

00:30:42
<transcript>: but

00:31:02
<transcript>: But there's got to be something you're more excited about. And right now. So I'll be honest right now, I've got, like, three or four things, like pretty big irons in the fire. And it's just kind of like day to day, one of my most excited to work on. So I work on stames every day. It's my real job. But like in terms of side projects, I'm kind of shuffling around a few things, and I think eventually one of them will pull ahead.

00:31:02
<transcript>: and be the

00:31:04
<transcript>: And be the most important.

00:31:12
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't think there's a scientific yes or no right answer here. I think it's sort of a field thing.

00:31:25
<transcript>: I did that now I'm stuck in a dead end job. Ooh. Why are you stuck, though? Cryo? I guess the job market's not as good as it used to be used to. You were never stuck. You could always just go somewhere else because developers were.

00:31:25
<transcript>: very in demand

00:31:31
mehulsharmamat: damnit I wish there was a tool to evaluate if I should make a tool or not

00:31:33
<transcript>: Very in demand. I don't know what that looks like. Now I think things are shifting a bit. It's just kind of a down market, but it'll come back.

00:31:33
<transcript>: technology is not gonna

00:31:35
<transcript>: Technology is not gonna anywhere.

00:31:40
<transcript>: Since I've purchased our works and not a good idea to not have your interest in them. Yeah, yeah, for sure.

00:31:41
mehulsharmamat: hmmmmmmmmmm wait a minute....

00:31:45
overra_dev: lol

00:31:46
<transcript>: I don't know if anyone can really predict how successful, like from a financial standpoint, like.

00:31:48
kryotoboi: But then who will run the project. Its my project MyAvatar

00:31:50
<transcript>: So when we chose to build Statmes, it's like eight years ago.

00:31:55
<transcript>: It was like probably last on our list of this could actually be.

00:31:55
<transcript>: a business

00:31:57
sj_se: but the internet told me chatGPT will start writing all code and replace me as an SE...

00:32:03
<transcript>: A business. It was just the most fun sounding one. Oh, wow. Okay. So I totally made this decision a long time ago. I just used my own advice.

00:32:13
mehulsharmamat: @sj_se im disappointed w the internet too

00:32:13
<transcript>: Eight years ago, we had, like my cofounder and I sat in my house and we had both quit our jobs. We decided we're going to do something together.

00:32:17
<transcript>: And we had a list of like six or eight things.

00:32:17
<transcript>: in

00:32:37
<transcript>: In Sam Use was one of the kind of like, the last one that we thought was worth doing because we didn't think we were big fans of basketball, and we thought it'd be cool for the safe to exist. And we really excited about building it. But we didn't feel like there were enough people that would care or that we could make any money with it. And it was sort of like down to the bottom. And we had all these other ideas that were like, more like practical.

00:32:41
<transcript>: We could imagine people paying for those things.

00:32:41
<transcript>: and

00:32:54
<transcript>: And we started working on a different one, but I just kept it just kept bothering me, like, I want to build. I want to try and build a natural language processing thing that could handle a sports question. So I eventually just kind of like, did it in the background.

00:32:54
<transcript>: built a little

00:32:58
<transcript>: Built a little prototype, and we got really excited about it. So.

00:32:58
<transcript>: yeah i

00:33:06
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't think you can really resist the urge for long if you've got the time, you're gonna work on the stuff that's really exciting to you eventually.

00:33:11
<transcript>: And it worked out. We raise a lot of money. Status is done pretty well. So.

00:33:17
<transcript>: I wish there was a tool to evaluate if I should make a tool or not.

00:33:17
<transcript>: make that

00:33:19
mehulsharmamat: that's awesome to hear :)

00:33:20
<transcript>: Make that tool. Naywh.

00:33:20
<transcript>: naywheel

00:33:26
<transcript>: Naywheel. Then who will run the project? It's my project. Think for the follow Zenoff.

00:33:29
<transcript>: It's my project who will run the project.

00:33:37
<transcript>: Oh, oh, you're saying at your job at your desk in job I gotcha.

00:33:37
<transcript>: who

00:33:45
<transcript>: Who will run the project? Yeah, it's hard to leave a job. If you have some sense of, like, inner responsibility, you definitely feel like you're letting people down.

00:33:45
<transcript>: sj

00:33:51
<transcript>: Sj. But the Internet told me Chad gbp will start writing all code and replace me as software engineer.

00:33:52
mehulsharmamat: const shouldYouMakeTheTool = () => Math.random() > 0.5

00:33:53
<transcript>: It's not gonna happen.

00:33:53
<transcript>: it is gonna

00:33:57
mehulsharmamat: where's my $100M

00:33:58
<transcript>: It is gonna make software engineers better at their job, though, so I think using it is good.

00:34:02
<transcript>: This pointer with the Internet. Yeah, me too.

00:34:07
<transcript>: There you go.

00:34:14
<transcript>: Ask Chat gpd Mayhu gbt which one you should work on.

00:34:22
<transcript>: Okay, so we're gonna do this client side. Maybe against my better judgment. I don't know. This is tiny and awesome. It says if it's tiny.

00:34:28
<transcript>: It's tiny and awesome. I'm probably just gonna like, look at how they did it and do it myself.

00:34:28
<transcript>: let's see

00:34:30
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:34:33
<transcript>: I don't need styles.

00:34:42
<transcript>: I need a headless headless? Vanilla js, tabs.

00:34:42
<transcript>: have control

00:34:43
<transcript>: Have control.

00:34:47
<transcript>: If something like that exists, I will take it.

00:34:48
sj_se: if the data is there i always lean toward client side, unless rendering is client side impact performance or load times

00:34:49
<transcript>: Headlight.

00:34:52
<transcript>: Down.

00:34:52
<transcript>: like i don't want

00:34:59
<transcript>: Like, I don't want any ui. I just want the like accessible because there is an accessibility angle to it. Right.

00:35:03
<transcript>: It's got to be accessible, and I don't know if I'm good enough to build all that.

00:35:07
<transcript>: Things like headless, UI.

00:35:07
<transcript>: i like using

00:35:08
<transcript>: I like using.

00:35:13
<transcript>: Radic for these situations, but that's react.

00:35:18
<transcript>: Thank you so much for that. Follow Mickey.

00:35:18
<transcript>: mickey

00:35:29
<transcript>: Mickey. Mickey, it's a data. Is there? I always lean toward client side. Unless rendering is client side impact performance or load times. Yeah. No, I've already got the data. It's a good call. I should just. I should do it.

00:35:35
<transcript>: I've never used alpine js. Is it good.

00:35:35
<transcript>: someone tell me

00:35:36
<transcript>: Someone tell me.

00:35:36
<transcript>: i know cal

00:35:44
<transcript>: I know caleb's. Good people. Is alpine. Like, what use Cases. Does that good for? I know. It's a really lightweight javascript thing.

00:35:55
<transcript>: I weirdly feel like like using solid is a really heavy solution to just get things like tabs. I don't even think that's a weird opinion. I think that's probably accurate. Right.

00:35:59
<transcript>: Okay. Accessible.

00:35:59
<transcript>: let's see

00:36:01
<transcript>: Let's see. Accessible.

00:36:09
<transcript>: Maybe I should say JavaScript instead of anelajs JavaScript.

00:36:13
<transcript>: Accessible Tab control.

00:36:14
yeltrah_: What you looking for?

00:36:23
<transcript>: Oh, here we go. Building accessible user interface ads in javascript. Hey, there we go.

00:36:23
<transcript>: here we go

00:36:24
<transcript>: Here we go.

00:36:33
<transcript>: Hard Gene. I'm looking for like, we're gonna do some client side tabs here, and I just want to do them in vanilla js because.

00:36:44
<transcript>: This. We're trying to minimize the amount of javascript on this site. It's just it's not a very interactive site. Stamp Music is mostly like ask questions, get a bunch of information.

00:36:44
<transcript>: and we do

00:36:55
<transcript>: And we do a ton of traffic from Google. And I do not want to like load a spa framework to add tabs which is really like the only interactivity right here on this page.

00:36:55
<transcript>: so i just

00:37:07
<transcript>: So I just want to like, what is the minimal way to just create a tap component? I could start just like writing javascript and figure it out. But also I want it to be good and accessible. And I worry I won't make it good and accessible.

00:37:16
<transcript>: Using the a element as I tab button element is a tab creating the interface tab Sharker.

00:37:23
<transcript>: I feel like there should be buttons. They're not going to different pages. So why would you do Anchor Tags.

00:37:28
<transcript>: Related Tabs With the Tab Panel Handling Vertical tabs.

00:37:38
yeltrah_: Something like this https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/#navigation

00:37:39
<transcript>: There's got to be just a very lightweight tab control, right.

00:37:43
<transcript>: Javascript Tab control Lib.

00:37:44
p1tog1ros: have you looked into rust?

00:37:51
sj_se: why does your cam zoom in when you drink your coffee?

00:37:53
<transcript>: React Spectrum adobe. So we're not. I'm not. I'm not using React, right? I would. I would already have a few different good options. Like I would probably use Radics.

00:37:53
<transcript>: welcome to chat

00:37:54
kryotoboi: Just do codepen

00:37:54
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat P. One.

00:37:54
<transcript>: togg

00:37:58
<transcript>: Togg one Ross, have you looked into rest.

00:37:58
<transcript>: yeah we

00:38:01
<transcript>: Yeah, we've played a little bit with Rest on stream.

00:38:15
<transcript>: I haven't had a reason to use rest yet. I like to learn new technologies because, like, I have a thing I really want to make, and there hasn't been a thing I really want to make that would benefit from rust. I mean, you could argue, do you arrest anything but, like.

00:38:15
<transcript>: i need

00:38:23
yeltrah_: Gotcha missed that not react

00:38:24
<transcript>: I need something that's, like, uniquely rust will deliver here, because I need, like, it's an embedded thing, or it's something where performance is ultra critical.

00:38:24
<transcript>: i just

00:38:28
<transcript>: I just haven't had that yet. Why did you cameras Zoom in when you drink coffee.

00:38:35
<transcript>: It's supposed to Zoom in when I make steel faces, but the algorithm, the.

00:38:35
<transcript>: model

00:38:42
<transcript>: Model. It's like a model that's trained on facial expressions. It's not very good. So if I block my face.

00:38:49
<transcript>: It'll think there's a weird expression going on because apparently a cup looks like a big expression.

00:38:49
<transcript>: and so

00:38:50
<transcript>: And so it zooms in.

00:38:50
<transcript>: i put

00:38:57
<transcript>: I put that into my overlays because I want to be able to, like, whenever I'm really mad. Like, what is this workiness word.

00:39:01
<transcript>: It'll Zoom in on me for dramatic effect. You know, I'm saying.

00:39:01
<transcript>: it was dumb

00:39:07
<transcript>: It was dumb, but it's trying to add a little spice, trying to keep it, keep it in resting, you know.

00:39:10
dexkopf: Is bootstrap-tabs js still a thing? Might try to use only that plugin without the rest of bootstrap for tab control

00:39:12
<transcript>: Javascript html Five tag control with Rich api accessible.

00:39:14
yeltrah_: Nah that's neat haha

00:39:14
<transcript>: Accessible.

00:39:14
<transcript>: i don't care

00:39:19
<transcript>: I don't care if it's headless anymore. I just wanted to be accessible and I want it to be JavaScript.

00:39:19
<transcript>: tab control

00:39:22
<transcript>: Tab Control and I want to be a library.

00:39:22
<transcript>: that's what i'm

00:39:24
<transcript>: That's what I'm want.

00:39:24
<transcript>: wanting

00:39:26
<transcript>: Wanting.

00:39:32
<transcript>: I'm at the ones on stampus.com aren't even assessed successful right now.

00:39:41
<transcript>: Can't even tab to them. Yep. Nope. So we're gonna make the site better. I'm not just gonna make it how it is. I'm gonna make it better as I go, you know.

00:39:48
<transcript>: There's got to be a headless vanilla js component toolkit. Is there not.

00:39:48
<transcript>: is there

00:39:50
<transcript>: Is there not.

00:39:50
<transcript>: is there

00:39:55
<transcript>: Is there's like really great options for react Radiks.

00:39:55
<transcript>: head

00:40:07
<transcript>: Headless or whatever it's called. Yeah, headless ui there's some like really good React and maybe View and other frontend library options. Where is the vanilla js headless component thing.

00:40:07
<transcript>: where is that

00:40:09
<transcript>: Where is that.

00:40:09
<transcript>: has anyone made

00:40:16
<transcript>: Has anyone made that library something just like Radics. But for vanilla js because I don't want to use react. Wait, Radics doesn't work for.

00:40:18
<transcript>: Vanilla.

00:40:22
<transcript>: Yes, it doesn't work for vanilla js, does it.

00:40:26
<transcript>: 's React only right.

00:40:31
<transcript>: Yeah, it's react only.

00:40:37
<transcript>: Think. Let's just make sure.

00:40:40
<transcript>: Style.

00:40:44
<transcript>: Yeah, man. I wish this? I wish this was it.

00:40:47
<transcript>: So they've got React, tabs.

00:40:58
<transcript>: There's just so many, like accessibility things to keep in mind. So you've got to be able to tab. And then like tab.

00:40:58
<transcript>: into

00:41:03
<transcript>: Into so if I'm up here and I want to tab to.

00:41:11
<transcript>: What is it? It's like arrow keys, probably. Yeah. So being able to arrow key navigate the tabs, that kind of Stuff's important for accessibility.

00:41:11
<transcript>: and

00:41:14
<transcript>: And it's just there's so many little details. It's hard to get it all right.

00:41:14
nzlaura: you can look at something which compiles down to vanilla js, e.g. svelte

00:41:18
<transcript>: And they do such a good job. I just wish.

00:41:18
<transcript>: i just wish

00:41:19
<transcript>: I just wish.

00:41:19
<transcript>: they did it

00:41:21
<transcript>: They did it outside of react.

00:41:26
yeltrah_: Felt like I've seen one recently

00:41:48
<transcript>: Who's gonna Port radics to the vanilla js for me there you go mehulers a project for you it won't make any money. It'll also be open source.

00:41:48
<transcript>: and

00:41:53
<transcript>: And I don't know how many people will use it, but I will love you for it if that's worth it.

00:41:55
<transcript>: Let's get started.

00:42:08
<transcript>: Just do code pin miss that not react. Yeah is bootstrap tabs JS still a thing might try to use only that plugin without the rest of boost protect control.

00:42:11
<transcript>: Should we make.

00:42:11
<transcript>: should

00:42:13
<transcript>: Should we make it.

00:42:13
<transcript>: just

00:42:15
<transcript>: Just the tab control, even.

00:42:15
<transcript>: just

00:42:19
<transcript>: Just a tab control that's accessible in vanilla JS.

00:42:19
<transcript>: i feel like

00:42:23
<transcript>: I feel like this kind of Stuff's gonna make it come back because of things like Astro.

00:42:26
<transcript>: Using vanilla js, and astro is just so easy.

00:42:26
<transcript>: and like

00:42:40
<transcript>: And like, feels really nice because you can still write typescript. They do all the hard work. You just put it in a script tag just like you would on a real html page. Just starts to feel really like you're working on stuff as it should be.

00:42:41
kryotoboi: I found a codepen by maladr0it called accessible tabs

00:42:46
<transcript>: You seen one recently.

00:42:50
<transcript>: Accessible tabs. Can you link it cryo.

00:42:51
nzlaura: you can easily add svelte to astro

00:42:54
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the Follow goofball Go Guinness.

00:42:58
<transcript>: You can easily add salt to astro. Okay.

00:42:58
<transcript>: i

00:43:00
<transcript>: I could add felt.

00:43:11
<transcript>: Yeah, I thought I was originally thought I was gonna do all the interactivity and solid just because I really want to use solid, but.

00:43:11
<transcript>: that feels

00:43:18
<transcript>: That feels heavy for just tabs I guess felt to your point is compiled into vanilla js so that would be a little better.

00:43:20
trivenge: !lurk

00:43:26
<transcript>: I called you lurk.

00:43:34
<transcript>: Let's see accessible accordion tabs. What are core cordian tab? We'll see a demo.

00:43:38
<transcript>: demoy

00:43:38
<transcript>: demoy according

00:43:38
trivenge: have a meeting. gl with the work

00:43:41
<transcript>: Demoy According tabs hey, this is what I want.

00:43:41
<transcript>: these are them

00:43:46
<transcript>: These are them. Are they accessible? It says they're accessible. They're accessible.

00:43:46
<transcript>: okay

00:43:48
<transcript>: Okay. Okay.

00:43:51
<transcript>: I could get down with this. Well, let's look at it.

00:43:54
<transcript>: Last year hey, they bumped.

00:43:54
<transcript>: something

00:43:56
<transcript>: Something from something to something.

00:44:01
<transcript>: Is it small? Does it say tiny, anywhere tiny.

00:44:01
<transcript>: i'll see

00:44:07
<transcript>: I'll see it's. It's already compiled into probably something. No. Okay. Oh, here we go. Minifier.

00:44:07
<transcript>: how big is

00:44:10
<transcript>: How big is it? How big is it.

00:44:14
<transcript>: 7 KB just for tabs.

00:44:19
<transcript>: Feels heavy for just had it. I mean, it's fine.

00:44:22
<transcript>: That's probably fine.

00:44:24
<transcript>: Can I.

00:44:24
<transcript>: make

00:44:25
mattmancodes: https://www.codeinwp.com/snippets/accessible-pure-css-tabs/

00:44:29
<transcript>: Make it smaller because this is probably more general purpose than I need. Right.

00:44:29
<transcript>: accessible

00:44:32
<transcript>: Accessible Pure css tabs.

00:44:32
<transcript>: what

00:44:33
<transcript>: What.

00:44:53
<transcript>: Thanks sir. We're gonna try and make some stuff happen on streamer. Get something done. Today. Interactive tab components are often created with job script, but using flexbox, along with some radio buttons, we can code a pure css tab component. A successful and keyboard friendly. Is that true? I don't have to write JavaScript.

00:44:56
kryotoboi: https://codepen.io/maladr0it/pen/pojrymP

00:44:57
<transcript>: What.

00:45:08
<transcript>: Is that true? The radio buttons are positioned out of the flow of the page, not visible. What.

00:45:09
<transcript>: the labels

00:45:10
<transcript>: The labels take precedent.

00:45:10
<transcript>: precedence

00:45:11
devagrawal09: Confirmed Adam hates JavaScript

00:45:15
<transcript>: Precedence intervisible using colors. All panel. Okay, so here's an example.

00:45:15
<transcript>: how

00:45:17
<transcript>: How does that work.

00:45:19
<transcript>: How does it work.

00:45:19
<transcript>: so this is

00:45:22
<transcript>: So this is the radio. This is a radio control. Here.

00:45:25
<transcript>: No, is it.

00:45:26
overra_dev: nice

00:45:31
<transcript>: I don't know. Is this dumb? Is this getting? Is this going too far.

00:45:31
lazy_developer: :O

00:45:37
<transcript>: Oh, does it go into a mobile view too.

00:45:37
<transcript>: what happens

00:45:39
<transcript>: What happens here.

00:45:40
alalfakawma: There's a radio button hidden

00:45:44
<transcript>: Oh, tab two. Well, we don't want to do that. Probably. But either way.

00:45:44
<transcript>: that's just

00:45:46
<transcript>: That's just a css change.

00:45:46
<transcript>: there's

00:45:49
<transcript>: There's a radio button hidden.

00:45:52
<transcript>: A radio button hidden.

00:45:52
<transcript>: dev

00:45:55
<transcript>: Dev confirmed Adam H. Javascript.

00:45:57
<transcript>: Hey, Dev.

00:45:57
<transcript>: i don't

00:45:58
alexkates: front end wizardry

00:46:14
<transcript>: I don't hate javascript. I just this site. Are I'm just overcorrecting, you know, like stat muse is like a spa in production today. And we do a lot of tracking from Google, and it doesn't make any sense for us to be a spot like literally the only interactivity is like these tabs.

00:46:14
<transcript>: and then

00:46:23
<transcript>: And then if you go to like, one of our just normal pages that has grids on it, like, Why is this a spot? This should not be a spa. This is it. Here we go. Here's the interactivity.

00:46:23
<transcript>: sorting

00:46:29
<transcript>: Sorting your columns on your grid and we're Loading the entire react runtime for that.

00:46:38
<transcript>: And making your really hard to do proper serving to Google like we have to all this stupid prerender stuff just to serve a decent page to Google.

00:46:38
<transcript>: it's just really

00:46:41
<transcript>: It's just really, really frustrating.

00:46:41
<transcript>: so

00:46:47
<transcript>: So over correcting rewriting the entire thing and trying to avoid javascript at all costs because I'm done.

00:46:47
alalfakawma: I've seen something like this some years back, they hide the radio button and do something which will link the button to a click, without js, idk wtf i'm saying but it works something like that afaik

00:46:48
nzlaura: gonna guess that doesn't have an aria tag

00:46:49
<transcript>: Alex is here.

00:46:58
<transcript>: I don't know if I like the css only option that feels kind of weird. I don't know why it seems better, but it feels weird.

00:46:58
<transcript>: i feel

00:47:05
<transcript>: I feel something like this. Some years back they hide the radio button and do something which will link the button to a click without JS.

00:47:06
overra_dev: label focuses the input

00:47:12
<transcript>: Gonna guess it doesn't have an area tag so that's the problem is I don't know.

00:47:16
<transcript>: Labels. Focuses the input.

00:47:24
<transcript>: Just sounds so gimmicky. Hey, dev, I want your opinion. You have opinions, and they're good. Dev, if you're still here.

00:47:27
<transcript>: Do you think someone should make.

00:47:28
cowfacedude99: @alalfakawma I did something like this, but with jquery today LUL

00:47:29
alexkates: adamdo8DealWithIt

00:47:32
<transcript>: You familiar with like Radics. Radics. Radics components.

00:47:37
<transcript>: Or like headless ui there's like these really good JavaScript.

00:47:37
<transcript>: and like sp

00:47:38
devagrawal09: Yep

00:47:39
<transcript>: And like spa.

00:47:39
<transcript>: accessible

00:47:40
<transcript>: Accessible.

00:47:40
<transcript>: comp

00:47:49
alalfakawma: @alalfakawma We all did xD LUL

00:47:50
<transcript>: Component headless toolkits as a terrible description, but those exist, right? And I really wish radics for just vanilla js existed.

00:47:50
<transcript>: is that dumb is

00:47:55
<transcript>: Is that dumb? Is the market for people who want to just write vanilla JS two tiny for that to matter or we.

00:47:55
<transcript>: other than me

00:48:05
<transcript>: Other than me use it because I would use it. And I feel like with astro, that kind of stuff might come into vogue. Like, here's just a I want nice, accessible components with minimal JavaScript.

00:48:09
devagrawal09: No that's perfectly valid, I'm surprised it doesn't already exist

00:48:11
kryotoboi: There are aria tags called aria-selected

00:48:14
<transcript>: And I want it to be as good as something like radics, where I just know I have these wonderful primitives I can build stuff with, I don't know.

00:48:14
<transcript>: i'm

00:48:18
alexkates: feels very valid to me

00:48:19
<transcript>: I'm surprised it doesn't already exist, too. And it might I might I might just be terrible at googleing.

00:48:21
<transcript>: Accessible.

00:48:21
<transcript>: javascript

00:48:23
<transcript>: Javascript.

00:48:25
<transcript>: Controls.

00:48:28
kryotoboi: https://codepen.io/maladr0it/pen/pojrymP

00:48:32
<transcript>: Like somebody surely has done this even if it's not wellmaintained.

00:48:35
texoport: https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-tabs

00:48:35
<transcript>: Seems like it should be a thing.

00:48:49
<transcript>: Feels very valid. Alex, too. Okay, so we're making it. No, I'm not. I'm not gonna make it. We just talked about how we have too many too many side projects. Calf ais is here. I did something like this. But with jquery today.

00:48:52
<transcript>: Wait. What.

00:48:57
alexkates: I'm here to get in the public.dev roladex tbh

00:48:57
<transcript>: You just. I'm trying to see what you replied to. I've seen something. Let's see. That was here.

00:49:14
<transcript>: They hide the radio button and do something which will link the button to a click. Yeah, I don't know this. We found this option that uses a hidden radio button that's only css, which is interesting, but it feels too interesting to me. Like, I'll forget how it works. And we'll hate that we chose to do something like this.

00:49:14
<transcript>: that

00:49:21
<transcript>: That's a pretty low risk thing. I guess. Like this is just a stupid tab component. Like if we need to rewrite it again, who cares.

00:49:21
<transcript>: but i don't

00:49:30
devagrawal09: Are you using some other framework than react or just vanilla

00:49:33
<transcript>: But I don't want to make the site worse. I want to make it better today. It's not accessible. Can't tab into these can't arrow. Yeah, it just jumps way down here. So it's not accessible today. It's just a dumb react thing.

00:49:33
<transcript>: and

00:49:40
<transcript>: And probably just buttons. Not dumb. Like the person who made it is dumb. I'm not shaming anyone on my team.

00:49:40
<transcript>: are you using

00:49:47
cowfacedude99: astro @devagrawal09

00:50:00
<transcript>: Are you using some other framework than reactor? Just vanilla. So far, dev. I've just. I've not even done anything interactive. So I told you the only things that are interactive are literally like column sorting. And now I ran into this tab control. So I've just avoided it all together. I haven't done anything yet. My plan was there's been a couple instances where I've dipped into vanilla, js and script Tags.

00:50:01
<transcript>: What did I do that for.

00:50:15
<transcript>: But astronaut makes that really nice. Like you just write a script tag. You can write typescript in it. It feels really good. So I have done that for something. I can't remember what it was. I wasn't even interactivity. I think it was something else. Maybe tracking or something. I don't know.

00:50:21
<transcript>: So. Yeah. That's, like the least friction thing I can do is just.

00:50:21
<transcript>: sprinkle a little

00:50:23
<transcript>: Sprinkle a little.

00:50:23
<transcript>: js in here

00:50:24
<transcript>: Js in here.

00:50:24
<transcript>: progress

00:50:29
<transcript>: Progressively enhance if you will. I don't know if this is progressive enhancement.

00:50:36
<transcript>: Let's see. Are you using other framework? Oh, did I say astro? Yeah.

00:50:36
<transcript>: it's

00:50:48
<transcript>: It's vanilla js? Oh, you're talking client side? Yeah, I'm here to get in the public Dev rolodex, to be honest. What? Alex? What's the public Dev rolodex.

00:50:59
<transcript>: I did shut down public Dev.

00:50:59
<transcript>: i did

00:51:00
nzlaura: are other devs maintaining this code? a lightweight framework can improve readability & maintainability over some vanilla js. depends what your priorities are, really.

00:51:02
<transcript>: I did shut it down. I mean, I hadn't worked on it for six months.

00:51:02
<transcript>: and

00:51:03
<transcript>: And.

00:51:03
<transcript>: the domain

00:51:07
lucyinthesky__: is astro worth it?

00:51:12
<transcript>: The domain expired, like three weeks ago, or something like that. And I felt really bad, but no one said anything, so I thought everything was fine. Everyone moved on, and it was a private basis.

00:51:12
<transcript>: but then

00:51:18
<transcript>: But then when I actually sent out the email, some people were surprised and I feel bad now and I want to make it up to them.

00:51:34
<transcript>: True. And Lucy in the sky. Thanks for those follows. Is astro worth it? Lucy, I'm loving it. It's kind of the perfect use case for what I'm doing though. So Sat news. Astro is perfect for satine. It's like PHP would have been perfect for status. I just don't know. Php.

00:51:34
<transcript>: but

00:51:47
<transcript>: But what status is it's like millions of pages that do really well on Google would have been great for php. It's great for astro. Therefore my first exposure to astro. I love it because it perfectly matches up with my use case.

00:51:57
jenswoeste: adam & chat. t3ggWave

00:52:00
<transcript>: Our other devs, maintaining this code, a lightweight framework and improve readability and maintainability over some of the ljs. Depends what your priorities are. Really? Yeah. So in Z, there's four of us. There's four engineers, only two of us. Where on the front end.

00:52:02
<transcript>: Ianz is here.

00:52:02
<transcript>: also

00:52:09
<transcript>: Also. Lucy, welcome to Chat. I don't know if I told you I appreciate when people join chat and you just join Chat for the first time.

00:52:13
<transcript>: So ash was great if you have a very like.

00:52:13
<transcript>: server

00:52:23
<transcript>: Server heavy use case not a lot of interactivity. You're not building a spa if you're building a spa Astro is not great. Use something else. Use next js or whatever you like.

00:52:28
<transcript>: Okay? Is anybody found an accessible.

00:52:28
<transcript>: javascript

00:52:29
<transcript>: Javascript.

00:52:33
teej_dv: Not a lot interactivity? Sounds like a twitch chatter Kappa

00:52:33
<transcript>: Control library that I can just use. That would be great.

00:52:39
daglee: Ok. I'm going to upstream this code now. 3500 code rust PR. \o/

00:52:40
<transcript>: Key just here. Not a lot of interactivity. Sounds like a twitch, chatter.

00:52:44
mattmancodes: LUL

00:52:48
<transcript>: I teach. Okay, I'm going to upstream this code now. 3500. Code rust. Pr. Whoa.

00:52:48
<transcript>: that's

00:52:51
<transcript>: That's a that's a big PR.

00:52:51
<transcript>: that's

00:52:52
<transcript>: That's.

00:52:57
<transcript>: That's always a good feeling, actually, when you finish work on a big PR.

00:52:57
<transcript>: i love that

00:53:01
<transcript>: I love that Adam Silver, like the NBA Commissioner.

00:53:07
<transcript>: I don't need to look at this because it's not even when I'm trying to do right now, but I want to look.

00:53:07
<transcript>: that's

00:53:10
<transcript>: That's the name of the NBA Commissioner. That's just funny.

00:53:10
<transcript>: also develop

00:53:12
<transcript>: Also developer apparently.

00:53:18
<transcript>: Modern html Five ui controls Pure JavaScript.

00:53:19
jenswoeste: @daglee what could possibly go wrong? LUL

00:53:23
<transcript>: Sync fusion sounds overly overly product ties.

00:53:25
kryotoboi: I sympathize with the person who has to review that PR

00:53:27
<transcript>: The Pure javascript ui Controls library.

00:53:27
<transcript>: yeah this sounds

00:53:28
<transcript>: Yeah, this sounds.

00:53:28
<transcript>: sounds like

00:53:30
texoport: This uses the same radio technique, but as an astro component https://github.com/JulianCataldo/web-garden/blob/develop/components/Tabs/Tabs.astro

00:53:30
<transcript>: Sounds like no for me.

00:53:37
<transcript>: I think this is gonna be really heavy? I want radics? But I want it for vanilla js? Come on, now it's got to exist.

00:53:44
<transcript>: I sympathize with the person who has to review that PR.

00:53:47
<transcript>: Thanks so much for Follow Alicia.

00:53:51
daglee: @JensWoeste It's encryption code, what could go wrong?

00:53:55
teej_dv: @kryotoboi why? Just approve it.

00:53:56
<transcript>: This uses the same radio technique, but as an Astro component. What? Julian? I think I know who that is.

00:53:58
<transcript>: Ooh, this might be good.

00:53:58
<transcript>: this might

00:54:00
<transcript>: This might be good.

00:54:02
<transcript>: This the Julian. I think it is.

00:54:03
elysiagriffin: hihi elysia1Wave

00:54:06
<transcript>: But that's okay. I'm not gonna.

00:54:13
<transcript>: Tabs out astro, hey, hey, so it's an Ashtro component? Has it work.

00:54:13
<transcript>: let's see

00:54:15
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:54:18
<transcript>: What's it using node crypto for.

00:54:27
<transcript>: Crypto for for an ID. Oh, yeah. Random idea. Okay.

00:54:27
<transcript>: what's it do

00:54:29
<transcript>: What's it do here.

00:54:33
<transcript>: Style set inline styles.

00:54:36
<transcript>: Nav so it uses a navigation.

00:54:39
<transcript>: Tabs map.

00:54:44
<transcript>: So my use case is a little unique in that.

00:54:44
<transcript>: the tabs

00:54:48
<transcript>: The tabs are very few of them. It's two of them.

00:54:48
<transcript>: and

00:54:49
<transcript>: And.

00:54:49
<transcript>: what do they do

00:54:54
<transcript>: What do they do? They have like a tab. This is a string array. And then panels.

00:54:54
devagrawal09: Not sure if something like radix can exist without a framework like react, it needs state and stuff

00:54:56
<transcript>: Okay.

00:55:06
<transcript>: Like, I don't need to be able to render a whole lot of different shapes of these. There's really just two of them. I guess this is one, too.

00:55:16
<transcript>: But I still wanted it to be accessible, so I guess it doesn't hurt me that this is more broadly gonna work for any number of tabs.

00:55:20
<transcript>: Label Maybe I could just look at what they do and make mine accessible.

00:55:27
<transcript>: So that I can use whatever markup I want and whatever styles I want. My problem with this is just that it comes with styles and I don't know.

00:55:27
<transcript>: what am i gonna think

00:55:36
<transcript>: What am I gonna think of that? Panels. That map. Yeah, I could just use this as inspiration. Maybe we'll just write this by hand. It is the only control I need to mess with. Alicia. Welcome to chat.

<transcript>: welcome

devagrawal09: What about this https://xtendui.com/

00:55:48
noctate12: What is sst

00:55:48
<transcript>: Sounds so hard. My brain hurts. Just thinking about that.

00:55:56
<transcript>: Thanks for this tech. So Port. I didn't notice that was you that posted this for me. I'm gonna use this as inspiration.

00:56:00
<transcript>: Assuming it has all of the accessibility stuff.

00:56:00
<transcript>: correct i don't

00:56:03
<transcript>: Correct. I don't know if it does actually.

00:56:03

00:56:06
<transcript>: Astro slots render name.

00:56:11
<transcript>: Oh, interesting. I've never seen this.

00:56:16
<transcript>: Astro. Html, jsx, html. Attributes.

00:56:17
teej_dv: @kryotoboi just say you ran completed the test plan and this wasn't covered.

00:56:28
<transcript>: So how does it? How does it? What props? Let's see what the props look like.

00:56:33
<transcript>: Props. Dot. What is it? Using class. That's it. Okay.

00:56:36
<transcript>: How do you pass the tabs in.

00:56:39
<transcript>: Are you just hard code them right here. Is that the idea.

00:56:39
<transcript>: what is this

00:56:43
<transcript>: What is this thing? Web garden. Let's see what this thing is.

<transcript>: Jsps configurations Featuring eslint, prettier and Style lent thank you for that. Follow Typosari. You have no reason to be sorry.

00:57:07
<transcript>: Here lies some reusable components and tooling settings taking advantage of Astro strengths as much as possible.

00:57:11
<transcript>: Focuses on common web patterns and progressive enhancements.

00:57:14
<transcript>: Interest.

00:57:18
<transcript>: Right now for sure.

00:57:18
<transcript>: let's see

00:57:20
<transcript>: Let's see what the live demo looks like.

00:57:23
<transcript>: Components.

00:57:26
<transcript>: We'll see that tab component. What do you say.

00:57:28
<transcript>: Where is it.

00:57:30
<transcript>: Tool tips.

00:57:34
<transcript>: This is definitely the closest thing we found.

00:57:34
<transcript>: to

00:57:36
<transcript>: To the spiritual.

00:57:46
<transcript>: Essence of what I'm trying to do and what I'm hoping for like vanilla js. But radics demonstration with tallest panel equals.

00:57:52
lilfreezi: theres that good lookin man i can catch on weekdays in the morning time

00:57:54
<transcript>: I expected didn't to be the same height. The equalization thing.

00:57:58
<transcript>: Without tallest equalization.

00:57:58
<transcript>: i don't see the difference

00:58:00
<transcript>: I don't see the difference actually.

00:58:05
<transcript>: Feel like there's not a difference in the two.

00:58:08
<transcript>: I.

00:58:10
<transcript>: ibs bar

00:58:10
<transcript>: ibs bar plus pan

00:58:12
mattmancodes: borked

00:58:15
<transcript>: Ibs bar plus Panels component, which works entirely without js. Oh, they did without js. I didn't catch that.

00:58:15
<transcript>: so

00:58:18
<transcript>: So this example there's no JS.

00:58:23
<transcript>: Are they doing? What are they doing? Are they doing the.

00:58:27
<transcript>: Css thing I guess. But are they hiding a rate.

00:58:30
<transcript>: Hidden.

00:58:33
<transcript>: Visible.

00:58:35
<transcript>: Okay.

00:58:35
<transcript>: in einstein

00:58:39
<transcript>: In einstein. They are. They didn't know that's just other than the panels, probably.

00:58:42
texoport: if you go back to the Tabs folder, you'd see how they use the tabs component

00:58:45
<transcript>: Okay, so I'm probably not gonna take a lot of inspiration for this. I don't think this is the way I want to do it.

00:58:52
<transcript>: Not sure if something like radius can exist without a framework like React. It needs state and stuff. That's a good point. Yeah.

00:58:52
<transcript>: that's a good point

00:58:53
<transcript>: That's a good point.

00:59:03
<transcript>: I'm just gonna do a oneoff implementation here and we're gonna make sure it's accessible. Was watching your setup. Vod as a photo of photographer. I love your lights. Thanks for allissia. I love my lights too.

00:59:03
<transcript>: they are a little

00:59:13
<transcript>: They are a little bright, but today I like it because it was cold in here. I woke up with goosebumps and the lights are bringing it up to a nice, normal temperature. Feels good.

00:59:19
<transcript>: What about this extend ui. Okay.

00:59:23
thdxr: it's 90 degrees here

<transcript>: Also the person who said I was breedable one day said I was looking very breathable.

00:59:49
<transcript>: extend

00:59:54
<transcript>: Extend ui I like this. I like this little header animation.

00:59:56
lilfreezi: was i wrong !!

00:59:58
lilfreezi: LUL

01:00:00
thdxr: shadn is great

01:00:02
<transcript>: Custom ui made easy with simplicity and total freedom. Powerful front and library of tailwind components enhanced Five and lgs OOH.

01:00:10
<transcript>: Do they have accessibility in mind? Yes. It's one of their philosophies. Part of their philosophy. Accessibility.

01:00:10
<transcript>: i'm very excited

01:00:11
<transcript>: I'm very excited.

01:00:11
<transcript>: so

01:00:14
<transcript>: So I want to tell you oh, this is by Shad.

01:00:18
kryotoboi: Does the background color on astro docs site make anyone here feel like the monitor is broken ?

01:00:19
<transcript>: Is that what you're saying? Dax.

01:00:21
<transcript>: Huh.

01:00:22
barryxbtw: no

01:00:25
<transcript>: Did somebody say.

01:00:25
<transcript>: oh

01:00:29
<transcript>: Oh, shanty and ui. Oh, yeah, shad's. Great. That's a reacting, isn't it.

01:00:29
<transcript>: isn't

01:00:33
barryxbtw: he commented on my question

01:00:34
thdxr: but no public component library is that useful imo

01:00:35
<transcript>: Isn't Chad cnu. I a react thing. You might just be asking for my opinions on it.

01:00:36
barryxbtw: yh

01:00:40
thdxr: have a whole take on this

01:00:40
<transcript>: If you are.

01:00:43
<transcript>: Then I.

01:00:43
<transcript>: like shad

01:00:53
devinda_me: yello !

01:00:57
<transcript>: Like shad, and I'm sure it's fantastic. If I were still writing a react, I would love it, but I think it's react right? Does the background color on Astrodoc site make anyone here feel like the monitor is broken? If I pulled up the astro dime today.

01:00:57
<transcript>: astro

01:00:59
barryxbtw: why so many people know shad i feel like i just found out about him lol

01:00:59
<transcript>: Astro build.

01:00:59

01:01:01
<transcript>: Documentation.

01:01:04
<transcript>: Make sure monitor is broken, the gradient.

01:01:12
<transcript>: No. He commented on my question.

01:01:12
<transcript>: no public

01:01:13
kryotoboi: Light mode please

01:01:16
<transcript>: No public component library. Is that useful? In my opinion.

01:01:16
<transcript>: have

01:01:19
<transcript>: Have a whole take on this. Dax, give me your take.

01:01:19
<transcript>: do you need to come up

01:01:24
<transcript>: Do you need to come up on stage to give your take because I need it's very pertinent to my current problems.

01:01:24
<transcript>: hello

01:01:27
<transcript>: Hello, DA vinda.

01:01:40
<transcript>: Oh, light mode? Do you want to see this in light mode? This is where you feel like your monitor is broken. Oh, like it's not quite white. Does that you mean like it's a little dim.

01:01:45
<transcript>: Like you feel like you need to turn up the brightness. Look at that.

01:01:47
<transcript>: Contributors.

01:01:47
<transcript>: wow

01:01:48
<transcript>: Wow.

01:01:52
kryotoboi: Yes NotLikeThis

01:01:54
<transcript>: Anybody in this stream can sugar.

01:01:56
<transcript>: Can we find your face.

01:02:05
<transcript>: Have you fun? Yeah. I know what you mean. It's just like a little offwhite. Enough offwhite that you feel like it should be wider. I know that feeling.

01:02:07
perseuswp: :D

01:02:08
<transcript>: Okay.

01:02:10
oosed: sup

01:02:15
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Perseus. What's up? Oozed.

01:02:15
<transcript>: are you guys

01:02:15
neeraj_31: hi everyone

01:02:24
<transcript>: Are you guys? Are you stepping up? Because you are on this page? Mirage Hi. How's it going? Welcome to Chat. Are you guys contributors.

01:02:24
<transcript>: to

01:02:25
<transcript>: To.

01:02:29
<transcript>: Astro is that why you just popped up in my chat.

01:02:29
<transcript>: or you're just saying hey

01:02:30
thdxr: private component libraries are great because they can be super opinionated and give you very few props. public ones offer so much customization it doesn't really help you not have to make decisions

01:02:31
<transcript>: Or you're just saying, hey, that's cool, too.

01:02:38
perseuswp: i wish :)

01:02:44
kisancodes: HeyGuys

01:02:46
devagrawal09: Wait you actually have AWS logo frames on your wall wtf

01:02:51
<transcript>: Private component. Here we go. Here's taxes take private component libraries are great because they can be super opinionated and give you very few props. Public ones offer so much customization doesn't really help you not to have to make decisions. I agree with that. Take completely tax. I do like things like Radics that are just primitives. And you build your component library on top of it.

01:02:59
<transcript>: And what I was saying at the beginning of the stream is I wish that existed outside of React. I wish Raidx had like a vanilla js version.

01:02:59
<transcript>: dev pointed out

01:03:04
oosed: I've contributed more than 80% of it in a parallel universe tho Kappa

01:03:08
<transcript>: Dev pointed out, you need state management. There's like state that's be kept track of so that's where the react thing or any other framework comes in handy.

01:03:14
<transcript>: Yeah, dev, I do actually have AWS logo friends on my wall. I had them printed.

01:03:15
texoport: bezoscloud decor

neeraj_31: https://socket-app-production.up.railway.app/

01:03:20
<transcript>: I've contributed more than 80% of it in a parallel universe, though. Okay.

01:03:22
<transcript>: That counts for me.

01:03:23
neeraj_31: check this out

01:03:25
thdxr: there's similar ones for solid but I've also been pretty unsuccessful with radix

01:03:26
<transcript>: What's this knee rag.

01:03:29
<transcript>: I'm sorry if I said your name terribly wrong.

01:03:29
<transcript>: socket

01:03:32
<transcript>: Socket App Production railway.

01:03:32
<transcript>: all of this

01:03:35
thdxr: used it for the SST consolen

01:03:35
<transcript>: All of this is because chat anonymously.

01:03:35
<transcript>: oh we're

01:03:39
<transcript>: Oh, we're all gonna chat. This is like another place for us to chat.

01:03:39
alexkates: I was using headless-ui in my latest side project. I ended up switching to daisyui though.

01:03:56
alexkates: Not great for your use case, but super interesting library!

01:03:59
<transcript>: So question zach, here's my real question. Used it. There's a similar one for Solid, but I've also been pretty unsuccessful with radics. Oh, really? Use it for the ssd console. And you don't like it? Okay. I was using headlight ui, and my latestide project ended up switching to daisy ui. So I think Alex, daisy ui is on that spectrum a little closer to.

01:03:59
<transcript>: what dax

01:04:01
<transcript>: What dax is saying.

01:04:01
<transcript>: it's

01:04:06
<transcript>: It's so customizable and so general purpose, that it's actually less useful.

01:04:10
<transcript>: I think but I could be wrong super interesting like.

01:04:10
<transcript>: you should tell me

01:04:13
<transcript>: You should tell me more about daisy, because I'm speaking out of ignorance.

01:04:20
<transcript>: So here's my problem, zach. Now that you're here, I'm gonna just make you answer all my questions.

01:04:24
perseuswp: i use antd most of projects. easy to customize.

01:04:25
<transcript>: Solve all my problems. I have this little tab component that's it. This is like the only interactivity on this page.

01:04:25
<transcript>: is i need

01:04:34
texoport: I find daisyui harder to really customize beyond just the colors tbh

01:04:36
<transcript>: Is I need to be able to switch between these two States I thought about because I've gone so far down the astro ssr, whatever world drink the koolaid. I thought about making these a query. Perhaps instead.

01:04:39
<transcript>: But I have all the data.

01:04:39
<transcript>: to render

01:04:59
<transcript>: To render all of it clients like there's one api call that gives me all the data to render all of this, including each tab. So should I make a client side? If I do, then I have to figure out how to make accessible tabs. These aren't accessible on status today, so I'm going to improve that while I'm here, not just going to copy blindly, we're gonna make it better.

01:04:59
<transcript>: so

01:05:04
thdxr: there was that library that was just a bunch of state machines you could wire to anything right

01:05:05
alexkates: DaisyUI is built on tailwind and makes a lot fo common components, like nice looking buttons, really easy. like, class="btn" as opposed to class="10,000 tailwind classes"

01:05:09
<transcript>: So let me know if you have any thoughts that goes for everybody backs or anybody. Someone solved this for me because I spent a lot of time just thinking about it. Ooh, we are chatting people kind of works. Right. Interesting.

01:05:09
<transcript>: yeah

01:05:10
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:05:21
<transcript>: Vision visually. It's a little tough for me. There's only two of us. That's probably because it hurts your eyes to look at a lot of people leaving.

01:05:25
<transcript>: It's hard to find the text messages from.

01:05:26
yeltrah_: https://github.com/chakra-ui/zag

01:05:31
thdxr: does this help https://zagjs.com/

01:05:33
devagrawal09: You might also find this interesting if you can do accessibility on your own - http://youmightnotneedjs.com/

01:05:33
<transcript>: The little identifiers here's what I would do if I if this is someone side project and they want my opinion, which they probably don't.

01:05:36
thdxr: idk if it's the right choice

01:05:45
<transcript>: But if you did. Oh, I can't style this. Never mind. I thought these would be like something, some kind of tag I could apply a style to. I would just dim this, right? Dim this so that it's not so bright.

01:05:45
<transcript>: and so that the

01:05:50
<transcript>: And so that the words stand out, you know, I'm saying.

01:05:50
<transcript>: is this to someone

01:05:54
thdxr: there is a way to do this without js isn't there

01:05:55
<transcript>: Is this to someone working on this in my chat right now? Oh, geez, someone's trying to drop script.

01:05:58
<transcript>: That's fun.

01:05:58
<transcript>: that's fun

01:05:59
<transcript>: That's fun.

01:06:05
typosrry: @alexkates daisy is still too much for me LUL, I don't like thinking about UI / UX

01:06:06
<transcript>: I feel like this is Dev, is fwt erwx. Is this Dev.

01:06:06
<transcript>: so i

01:06:10
<transcript>: So I get them. Not like general. Just a Dev. I mean like Dev.

01:06:17
<transcript>: You might also find this interesting. If you can do accessibility on your own, you might not need js. Comm OOH like the sound of that.

01:06:23
<transcript>: Oh, the radio has taken us into glass animals, and I'm happy about it.

01:06:23

01:06:40
<transcript>: Aunt D. Most of projects Easy to customize.

01:06:54
<transcript>: Let's see what zach js is. And you do might not need javascript. You guys are coming through. I know you. You guys are good at finding stuff. I know dax is because he finds everything.

01:07:06
<transcript>: There is a way to do this without js, isn't there? Oh, yeah, there is with css. Is that good? Dax, I need you to tell me when things are good or bad. Someone does it with just css, like, over here somewhere.

01:07:08
mattmancodes: The youmightnotneedjs is the CSS only one

01:07:15
typosrry: oh zag is by chakra devs

01:07:17
<transcript>: Right here. This is just a css version. I just wanted this. I was too hokey to do it in css. I don't know. Lou Jack, thanks so much. Follow.

<transcript>: can we use

01:07:54
<transcript>: Can we use flash to make.

01:08:00
<transcript>: Okay. So let's look at these. Let's look at you. Might not do any JavaScript.

01:08:00
<transcript>: by all means

01:08:01
lilfreezi: i think they were calling you a certified dilf

01:08:07
<transcript>: By all means, use it while also being aware that you can build so many functional ui composers about the additional fancy.

01:08:19
<transcript>: Some of the demos might have accessible. Okay, some components. Here we go. Is this the css? Only you said, can I do it without using sdss? Because I don't know what that is. I used to know what that was, but I don't remember anymore.

01:08:19
<transcript>: let's just search

01:08:21
<transcript>: Let's just search for tab.

01:08:23
<transcript>: Tab.

01:08:26
lilfreezi: what is scss actually

01:08:31
<transcript>: Out tab. And here we go. Tabs. Functional css tabs revisited. And I want them to be accessible. It's important to me.

01:08:36
<transcript>: Thanks for watching. Follow dmb Boy and Hello, Zimy.

01:08:42
<transcript>: What is S. Css? Actually, that's a great question. Someone tell me. It's like.

<transcript>: Sas? Any sas, right.

01:09:08
<transcript>: I've never only seen it from a distance. Haven't looked into it.

01:09:08
<transcript>: it's

01:09:10
<transcript>: It's a preprocessor.

01:09:10
<transcript>: so

01:09:13
<transcript>: So these are tabs and these are probably css only.

01:09:13
<transcript>: and that's

01:09:21
<transcript>: And that's what we're gonna do. I've decided we're not gonna write any javascript. We don't need job script do we can do this just with CSS.

01:09:21
<transcript>: and it will

01:09:24
<transcript>: And it will be accessible, I guess.

01:09:28
<transcript>: I can arrow between them. How big is that with that JavaScript.

01:09:30
<transcript>: Wait. Is there JavaScript.

01:09:36
<transcript>: That's funny. You go to the javascript tab tab, and it says you might not need js. Comm.

01:09:40
fatten: has to be a radio

01:09:42
<transcript>: Have they do the arrow keys? Oh, radios just works like that out of the box. Oh, that's brilliant.

01:09:42
<transcript>: that's brillian

01:09:44
<transcript>: That's brilliant. Okay, we're doing that.

01:09:49
<transcript>: Has to be a radio. Good call. That's what we're doing. I decided.

01:09:49
<transcript>: it has been decided

01:09:54
<transcript>: It has been decided, but I'm curious what this is. Ui components powered by finite state machines.

01:09:56
<transcript>: Okay.

01:10:01
<transcript>: That works for solid view and react. Oh, I don't want this. Then.

01:10:08
<transcript>: Because I'm not waiting framework agnostic component logic is largely javascript. We consume it in any javascript framework.

01:10:16
<transcript>: React view. Okay, now I'm just going to go ahead and close this one. I gotta start making some decisions.

01:10:16
<transcript>: we're gonna close

01:10:23
<transcript>: We're gonna close this thing and the astrodocs. And what was this custom I made easy was simplicity and total freedom.

01:10:23
mattmancodes: Need to write youmightnotneedafrontendstatemachine.com

01:10:29
<transcript>: So what was this? I was excited about this. I remember now. Module design, components.

01:10:31
<transcript>: Demo.

01:10:31
<transcript>: toolt

01:10:33
<transcript>: Tooltips.

01:10:37
<transcript>: Let's see, are there tabs.

01:10:41
<transcript>: Tabs.

01:10:43
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:10:43
<transcript>: hail wind

01:10:45
<transcript>: Hail wind vanilla JS.

01:10:45
<transcript>: and gsap

01:10:48
<transcript>: And GSAP, what is GSAP.

01:10:51
<transcript>: You might not.

01:10:56
<transcript>: You might not need frontend state machine. That's funny.

01:10:58
<transcript>: That's funny.

01:11:01
<transcript>: Tailwind, css components.

01:11:01
<transcript>: so

01:11:04
fatten: gsap is an animation library

01:11:08
darkmast93: hey dad

01:11:11
<transcript>: So what's GSAP complex interactions form js components? You only need to specify custom animations, scroll, sticky, and parallel axe animations. Clearly, it supports parallel acts because they have gone.

01:11:11
<transcript>: very

01:11:15
<transcript>: Very heavy on the parallel axe, scroll stuff.

01:11:15
<transcript>: which is

01:11:17
mattmancodes: GSAP = Greensock animation JS lib

01:11:26
<transcript>: Which is cool, but like, doesn't scream minimalism, which is what I'm going for here. I just need the tiniest bit of stuff to make this work. Let's look at the components just so I give it a chance. Knee ratch thank you so much for the following.

01:11:32
<transcript>: Gsap Green sock Animation js. Library hey, dad.

01:11:35
<transcript>: Dark Master, welcome to chat.

01:11:35
<transcript>: hey

01:11:37
<transcript>: Hey, dad.

01:11:37
<transcript>: i

01:11:41
<transcript>: I have two sons. I don't think you're one of them. They're asleep right now.

01:11:41
<transcript>: i hope

01:11:45
<transcript>: I hope. No, they're not asleep. They're awake now. No, they're not.

01:11:45
<transcript>: they're asleep

01:11:47
devagrawal09: The API is not the best, it uses data attributes

01:11:54
<transcript>: They're asleep. Daily Savings Man hits me every time. Okay, tabs, let's look for tabs, and then I'm gonna move right on. We're gonna do the HTML.

01:11:54
<transcript>: or the css

01:11:56
<transcript>: Or the css only.

01:11:56
<transcript>: let's see

01:11:59
<transcript>: Let's see. This one might be css only.

01:12:02
darkmast93: you are funny

01:12:11
<transcript>: So here's what they look like. Oh, geez, they actually link to something. Dark masks. Think of the falls. A Nick, right. As I was thinking. Dark masks. Also, thank you for the follow.

01:12:17
lilfreezi: are you on astro 2.1 for this?

01:12:19
yeltrah_: Hahah the camera zoom in does have dramatic effect

01:12:20
<transcript>: I'm like that. That took me somewhere else. I thought I was clicking a tab. It was actually a hyperlink.

01:12:20
<transcript>: okay

01:12:21
thdxr: nice follower queue adam

01:12:26
<transcript>: Okay. This is a little too heavy on the animations and stuff for me. This one's not gonna do it.

01:12:30
<transcript>: Oh, they have three implementations, though, so maybe they got it right on the third one.

01:12:30
<transcript>: that looks

01:12:32
<transcript>: That looks better.

01:12:34
thechosenone1080: the headphones look so sick init? i love their look

01:12:44
thechosenone1080: the price tho 💀

01:12:52
<transcript>: I don't think this is exactly what we're looking for. I'm intrigued. This is the kind of thing this extend ui keeps me looking at it because I'm intrigued, but I think the implementation is lacking for me. Okay, let's move on. I got a lot to do. Well, we can't get hung up on this thing all day. So let's close all this. I'm gonna model off of this approach, which is.

01:12:57
<transcript>: The you might not need js. Comm. Thank you dev, for this recommendation.

01:13:01
<transcript>: Dax. Nice follower. Q. Thanks.

01:13:01
<transcript>: yeah

01:13:04
<transcript>: Yeah, it's not a lot of time on it only took three months.

01:13:09
<transcript>: I dark mass. You are funny. Are you talking to me? Am I funny.

01:13:10
yeltrah_: What headphones are those?

01:13:14
yeltrah_: I need some new ones

01:13:17
<transcript>: I don't know. Some people say I'm funny. I really don't think I am objectively, mostly because, like I spend most of my life with my family.

01:13:17
<transcript>: and i

01:13:19
<transcript>: And I.

01:13:19
<transcript>: like my

01:13:21
<transcript>: Like my wife.

01:13:21
<transcript>: she

01:13:25
<transcript>: She does not think I'm funny and I'm not to be fair.

01:13:33
thdxr: does your wife like you?

01:13:36
noctumsempra: lol

01:13:40
beeut: LUL

01:13:42
mattmancodes: LUL

01:13:43
lilfreezi: nah thats a part of being funny 💯

01:13:45
<transcript>: I mean, she laughs sometimes it mostly lasts at me, at the dumb things I do. So I think I've been conditioned to think I'm not funny. But if you think I'm funny, I mean, maybe you're right. Maybe my wife, who lives with me is wrong. I don't know. Are you on astro? Two. One for this little freezey. No, I don't. What is two. One? Have. I want to ask her. Two.

01:13:45
<transcript>: days ago

01:13:46
lilfreezi: cant convince me otherwise

01:13:48
yeltrah_: @thdxr loool

01:13:48
<transcript>: Days ago. I am not keeping up with it.

01:13:48
<transcript>: we just released asher

01:14:02
jenswoeste: I know Im funny. How? The awkward silence at the dinner table when I tell a joke.

01:14:02
<transcript>: We just released asher two feature a two one built in image support, automatic image option, engine and landing is landing in azure Core. I'm curious Mark doc, which I'm very aware of. That's cool. If I were using markdoc, I'd be very excited because I do think Mark doc is good.

01:14:07
lilfreezi: i was asking bc of the image optimization thing

01:14:08
thechosenone1080: @yeltrah_ get the bereyedynamics dt 770 pro

01:14:09
nzlaura: astro check --watch is sick

01:14:09
<transcript>: Astro check uses flag to type check your astrophile string development, okay.

01:14:09
<transcript>: infertize

01:14:11
<transcript>: Infertize for dynamic.

01:14:11
<transcript>: routes

01:14:12
<transcript>: Routes.

01:14:16
thechosenone1080: these are too expensive iirc

01:14:18
<transcript>: Oh, wait. What? I thought it already did that.

01:14:18
<transcript>: get

01:14:23
<transcript>: Get static pass export in your astro pages used to find wishpace. Oh, I don't use that, okay, never mind.

01:14:25
<transcript>: Never mind.

01:14:34
<transcript>: Okay. I don't need that.

01:14:34
<transcript>: but i'm

01:14:36
<transcript>: But I'm curious about builtin image support.

01:14:36
<transcript>: builtin

01:14:39
<transcript>: Builtin image optimizations enable neuron.

01:14:43
<transcript>: If you're already familiar with our original astro image, I am.

01:14:43
<transcript>: dax

01:14:48
<transcript>: Dax, this thing doesn't work in the ss T Astro site, right? But maybe this new thing does.

01:14:48
<transcript>: new builtin image

01:14:49
devagrawal09: I love that after tanstack router every metaframework realized typesafe routing is good

01:14:55
lituanian_eagle: !pc

01:14:56
<transcript>: New builtin image component should feel familiar, but with some notable improvements, you can now adjust the size of the image using width and height properties without changing its astrosure.

01:15:06
<transcript>: Quality. Okay resulting image will be automatically optimized for you in a modern web format for maximum performance. So it is like web P and avis, and all that.

01:15:07
lituanian_eagle: !help

01:15:07
fossabot: @lituanian_eagle Channel commands are available at: https://fossabot.com/adamdotdev/commands

01:15:08
<transcript>: With minimum.

01:15:08
<transcript>: cls

01:15:09
thdxr: someone tried it and there's some issue on the Astro end I believe, not sure though

01:15:14
<transcript>: Cls I do hate commutal landshift so much like it's probably the web vital I care the most about.

01:15:14
<transcript>: additionally

01:15:23
<transcript>: Additionally, the builtin image support can be swapped out for another provider, allowing you to connect this to production image cdn like Cloudnary or Versailled. Leverage your image object. Okay, interesting.

01:15:23
<transcript>: astro two one

01:15:41

01:15:43
<transcript>: Astro Two One also answers one of our most requested features coming out of the original 20 launch image handling inside of content collections. Man, I really wish I used astro for the reasons that it's extra special, which is like a bunch of markdown files. I don't sat News doesn't have that, so I haven't been able to take advantage of any of that nice new stuff. And it's kind of a bummer.

01:15:52
<transcript>: Let's see. I love that after Tansteck router, every metaphramwork realized type safe routing is good. Yeah.

01:15:59
<transcript>: Tanner blazing that path. These are too expensive. What are we talking about? Astrocheck. Get the bear down.

01:16:04
<transcript>: Oh, you were asking because these image optimization thing a little freezie.

01:16:05
yeltrah_: @yeltrah_ thanks will take a look

01:16:06
mattmancodes: Statmuse markdown rewrite... LET'S GO!

01:16:11
<transcript>: Yeah, yin's, I know. I'm funny how the operate sounds at the Zoom table when I tell a joke exactly.

01:16:11
<transcript>: yin's

01:16:14
<transcript>: Yin's. Maybe my audience is just not.

01:16:22
<transcript>: Eight and three year old boys or 35 yearold women. Maybe my audience is you people, whatever you are.

01:16:22
<transcript>: maybe

01:16:23
<transcript>: Maybe.

01:16:33
devagrawal09: I am 8

<transcript>: No she.

01:16:43
<transcript>: she

01:16:46
thdxr: loling

01:17:02
<transcript>: She's just like somebody who's wants the best in life, like in everything. And I am not like she wants to be. She like, Min max's Health and Wellness and how she eats and how she exercises, like everything in life. She's trying to get better. And I'm not always trying to get better. Sometimes I just like, being, oh, you just kind of like being how I am, you know.

01:17:02
<transcript>: so

01:17:05
<transcript>: So in that sense.

01:17:09
<transcript>: Sometimes she disapproves of my behavior.

01:17:17
<transcript>: But she likes me. We have a good time. We like each other. Okay? I'm really trying to defend it. I sound very unbelievable. Now.

01:17:17
<transcript>: okay i'm gonna

01:17:19
<transcript>: Okay. I'm gonna move on.

01:17:23
jenswoeste: Sounds familiar

01:17:30
<transcript>: Pc help channel commands. Someone tried it and they some issues on the astro. And I believe not sure, though. Okay, so the new image component still doesn't work. Maybe.

01:17:30
<transcript>: okay

01:17:30
beeut: Sounds like, i hope she likes me LUL

01:17:32
<transcript>: Okay.

01:17:50
<transcript>: Dev your aight. Okay, well, I actually would believe it these days because it's amazing. Some of the things I see, amazing things that were built or amazing developers. And it's like, oh, they're 15 awesome.

01:17:50
<transcript>: like

01:17:50
daglee: As somebody that peaked at kindergarten, improving is overrated.

01:17:58
<transcript>: Like, you know, I was a lifeguard when I was 15. I didn't I don't think I used computers when I was 15. And like Gin Z built different.

01:17:58
<transcript>: i'm

01:18:00
thdxr: I'm actually 15

01:18:01
<transcript>: I'm a 27 year old junior developer just to be clear, okay.

01:18:01
<transcript>: all right dark

01:18:06
<transcript>: All right, dark Mass. So I resonate with the 27 year olds. There's hope for me.

01:18:08
<transcript>: And resonating with Gin Z.

01:18:12
<transcript>: zess really some

01:18:15
<transcript>: Zess really some like I hope she likes me.

01:18:18
thdxr: super impressive

trivenge: thank god you didnt say 12, adam would have to ban you from his channel per twitch's tos @thdxr  LUL

01:18:38
<transcript>: So it works great in their content collection stuff which I don't use and I'm FOMOed into wanting to use it. Okay. Let's get back to building the tab control, and I say back to we haven't started yet. Let's start building the tab control.

01:18:38

01:18:54
<transcript>: I feel like I should just go ahead and take a break. Do we have anything to talk about? Because I'm not working. So might as well come over here and take a break. And then when we go back to the screen.

01:18:54
<transcript>: we're so focused

01:18:56
<transcript>: We're so focused.

<transcript>: oh

01:19:13
thdxr: I like the parts when you don't work

01:19:17

<transcript>: it's all down

01:20:08
oleksii_lisovyi: 31 – feels great!

01:20:12
<transcript>: It's all downhill after 25. I don't know. To be 25 again, to be 28. That sounds amazing. So I wouldn't say it's all downhill. I would say it's all downhill after whatever age you are. Once you're a certain age.

01:20:12
<transcript>: you always

01:20:13
oetziofficial: the podcast is INCREDIBLE

01:20:15

01:20:23
<transcript>: yeah

01:20:25
jenswoeste: at 47 you are past giving a flying **** about others opinions. Your kids are starting to move away from home. If you want a nice bottle of wine, you just go for it.

thdxr: oleksiis wife probably likes him

01:24:49
<transcript>: And she we would go for walks with our boys. They're very small. We go for walks around the neighborhood. And she would drive by and, like, see us on her way home from work or whatever. It timed out with our walk.

01:24:49
<transcript>: and

01:24:54
<transcript>: And I remember one day my wife and I still talked about it. She pulled up.

01:24:54
<transcript>: and she

01:24:59
<transcript>: And she said something about, like, oh, they're so cute. Like the way they were dressed or something.

01:24:59
<transcript>: they're really great when

01:25:02
<transcript>: They're really great when they're that small. And then they grow up in their jerk.

oetziofficial: I think you said that there are problems some people might have, that could be solved via aws (and their services) like the 1GB file streaming thing, not sure what it was about

01:25:12
<transcript>: My kids are jerks, she said. And that stuck with us. So I'm sure there's an age where I'll be like, yeah, I'm ready for you guys to go ahead and move out, but I'm not there yet. Right now, they're little and squishy.

01:25:12
<transcript>: the three year

01:25:23
<transcript>: You're 40, Adam. Sorry.

oleksii_lisovyi: Yes, I'm in Ukraine.

01:26:39
<transcript>: What's Hype razor like we do a typing test. I do want to do a typing testing test section. I'm curious thought it'd be depressed when the kids reach the age where they started moving from home on the contra. I'm just super proud that they're now independent, confident, and having extreme buffet of opportunities ahead of them. That's amazing Yen. That's one of my greatest fears in life, though, is that my kids won't be because I'll do everything wrong and I'll raise them wrong and they won't be independent. And they'll.

01:26:39
<transcript>: struggle

01:26:42

01:27:15
<transcript>: that's me calling

01:27:21
<transcript>: That's me calling out Rocks. I did. I did get a little inflammatory about indie hacking, and I think.

01:27:21
<transcript>: if you identify

01:27:22
devagrawal09: damn bro how'd you find a wife at 22 i can't find a girl at 24

01:27:29
jenswoeste: @adamdotdev based on how much attention you have put in to polishing your stream I find it hard to believe you wont nail it with your kids upbringing LUL

01:27:32
<transcript>: If you identify as an indie hacker, maybe it felt like I was calling you out. I just think that whole indie hacking communities interesting. Maybe I'm salty because I tried indie hacking and I kind of hated it. I don't know.

01:27:36
thdxr: @devagrawal09 try being sexier

01:27:38
beeut: Never nester is when you never nest in code (like if, for, etc)

01:27:39
<transcript>: Yo, David sends that right. My 14 year old makes it a sport to be a freaking contrarian.

01:27:39
<transcript>: doesn't matter

01:27:43
devagrawal09: @thdxr how

01:27:50
<transcript>: Doesn't matter what I say. Always takes the opposite just to aggravate his mother and I that sounds like a 14 year old. One day my kids are gonna be reaching or be teaching me some javascript framework. Exactly.

01:27:50
<transcript>: fascination with

01:27:56
<transcript>: Fascination with kids follows the dunning kruger graph. I feel like I should know what the dunning kruger graph is.

01:28:04
<transcript>: Oh, is that the one? The big Bell in the middle. So fascination with them. No, no. Fascinating. Would be big at the beginning.

01:28:16
<transcript>: And then Wayne, and then go up. Is it the opposite of a big Bell? I'm not sure I could Google it, but you're in your new crane. Alexa, I'm so sorry that you've had to deal with a lot of stuff.

01:28:16
<transcript>: over last year

01:28:17
<transcript>: Over last year.

01:28:17
<transcript>: that

01:28:25
<transcript>: That I don't know. I have no words. I'm now I'm gonna sound really dumb because I just don't know what to say, but I'm sorry. I hope it gets better.

01:28:25
<transcript>: yes

01:28:29
<transcript>: Yes type racer is multiplayer and you can make a private room. That'd be fun.

01:28:29
<transcript>: how do

01:28:34
<transcript>: How do you find a wife? At 22, I can't find a girl. At 24. We actually went to high school together.

01:28:38
<transcript>: So I did that thing. Were you married somebody that you've known most of your life.

01:28:42
devagrawal09: it rises to peak in the initial years, then drops down in teens because they get annoying, then they become adults and nice again

01:28:51
thdxr: Adam is a perv he married a girl he found in a high school

01:28:52
devagrawal09: (hopefully)

01:28:54
oleksii_lisovyi: @thdxr hot take!

01:28:57
the_philter: Peaks -> Valleys -> Plateaus

01:28:58
<transcript>: Yin's based on how much attention you have to put into polishing your stream, I find it hard to believe you won't nail it with your kids upbringing. That is so kind. I don't know, though. I feel like sometimes my attention to detail can be a little intense and I might be going too far that way. I think about this a lot, actually. Like our parents, our generation before us. Not like my parents.

01:29:01
<transcript>: But like the generation before ours.

01:29:04
yeltrah_: @thdxr She definitely doesn't like him

01:29:13
sathyabhat: btw Adam, did you do your setup overview yet?

01:29:16
<transcript>: In America, where they're called the Baby boomers. I think their generation was a lot more handsoff, like, let us just kind of, like, explore and do stuff. And I think our generation on whole, like, average, is more handson, more like I'm way more involved with my kids.

01:29:16
<transcript>: and that sounds

01:29:26
sathyabhat: remember there was a tweet requesting that few days ago

01:29:29
jenswoeste: we are a generation of flight attendants LUL

01:29:31
<transcript>: And that sounds like a good thing. But I think in some ways I hover. I'm one of those, like, I'm too involved. And I don't just let them figure stuff out. So I'm trying to learn. Casey, my wife. Listens. A lot of books, a lot of parenting books. That's the other thing. I don't know if my parents read parented books. We've read like a hundred.

01:29:31
<transcript>: and

01:29:39
<transcript>: And sometimes I wonder if it's like golf. If you think too much about it, you start getting worse. Okay? I'm gonna stop.

01:29:47
<transcript>: Rises to peak in the initial years, then drops down in teens. Oh, it's like the Hype graph. That's the denning krueger. Yeah. Okay.

01:29:47
<transcript>: and

01:30:01
<transcript>: And then they become adults. And nice again. So it's a slow build backup. Yeah, that's how I know that one. It's like Hype cycle graph. Okay, I'm gonna purve. I married a girly. Family. High school. Stop it, dax. She wasn't in high school. She was 20 when we got married.

01:30:01
trivenge: in the autism and elitist investor communities, they talk about the importance of letting the child explore their own interests

01:30:10
<transcript>: Peaks, valleys, plateaus. Got it? She definitely doesn't like him.

01:30:15
<transcript>: I do feel like my wife.

01:30:19
<transcript>: This is last thing, and I'm gonna go back to work. We're gonna actually do something.

01:30:24
trivenge: kind of like a montessori style

01:30:26
<transcript>: She her interest in me is the dunning kruger graph. And I think right now.

01:30:33
<transcript>: I think I know we're at an unfortunate part on that graph. Her interest in me peeking high school, I think.

01:30:33
<transcript>: and

01:30:35
oleksii_lisovyi: @thdxr BTW back in days when everyone went into the offices, I hooked my wife by reading a very thick book at a lunch break ;)

01:30:40
<transcript>: And I was like the high school quarterback. I was pretty cool. She was really into me.

01:30:43
<transcript>: And then I think she married me and realized.

01:30:43
<transcript>: i'm a super

01:30:45
thdxr: you better hope it's dunning kruger

01:30:46
trivenge: if i have kids, and i hope so, i would let my children explore passions personally, but guide them in the process. but thats just me

01:30:50
<transcript>: I'm a super nerd. I work on computers all day because I became that an adulthood. I wasn't that really in high school.

01:30:53
<transcript>: Now she's married to a super nerd and.

01:30:53
<transcript>: i'm very

01:30:56
<transcript>: I'm very obsessive and.

01:30:56
<transcript>: anyway

01:31:05
<transcript>: Anyway, I'm gonna stop. I'm gonna stop talking about our marriage. She's not fair to her. She's not here to defend herself. My wife's the best. Genuinely, the best. And she does like me. I promise.

01:31:05
<transcript>: just maybe

01:31:07
<transcript>: Just maybe not as much she did in high school.

01:31:11
trivenge: obsessive is a good thing anyways at times SeemsGood  lol

01:31:14
<transcript>: See, by the way, Adam, do you do your setup overview? Oh, I did satya. I did that. An office tour.

01:31:14
<transcript>: a

01:31:15
thdxr: I met my wife at work too, she was head of product and I was head of engineering

01:31:18
thdxr: a classic story

01:31:21
<transcript>: A tour. I can't say that word. I did it and it's. There's a vodka out there. I might put something on YouTube. Eventually.

01:31:24
thdxr: product and eng never worked so well

01:31:24
<transcript>: We are the generation of flight. Attention.

01:31:26
sathyabhat: cool thanks

01:31:28
mattmancodes: who are you trying to convince? us or you? LUL

01:31:36
trivenge: two-headed dragon SeemsGood  @thdxr

01:31:36
<transcript>: Okay, I'm gonna try and read the rest of these as quickly as I can so I can get back to it. Triv montessori, my wife's super into montessori player cake. Thanks so much for the following.

01:31:37
yeltrah_: @thdxr Feel like there's a joke somewhere here

01:31:39
<transcript>: When everyone.

01:31:43
<transcript>: Reading a very thick book at a lunch break. Oh, nice.

01:31:43
<transcript>: that's cool

01:31:44
devagrawal09: why are so many male engs married to female product people

01:31:47
<transcript>: That's cool. Just look smart in front of her. Better hope it's done in Kruger.

01:31:51
<transcript>: Hope it comes hopefully comes back up.

01:31:53
kryotoboi: We must never let Adam catch up

01:32:11
<transcript>: Okay. If I have kids, that helps. So I would let my children explore passions personally, but guide them in the process. That's just me. Yeah. No, I'm trying to do that. I'm trying to. I'm trying to let them just, like, find their way and be more like there was a study. Okay. I keep saying I'm gonna do, like, I'm gonna get back to work. But I just have to tell you this thing that I learned yesterday. Okay? I'm going to.

01:32:11
<transcript>: just

01:32:13
<transcript>: Just tell you.

01:32:19
<transcript>: Because my wife showed it to me. It was like on TikTok. I think there was a study about.

01:32:19
<transcript>: these three

01:32:20
yeltrah_: Can we get him to keep trying to catch up to chat so he doesn't actually work

01:32:20
devagrawal09: i feel like i need to put "if you're a product manager swipe right" in my tinder bui

01:32:21
devagrawal09: bio

01:32:23
playercake: HeyGuys

01:32:32
<transcript>: These three. They took these three groups of kids, and they had them performing exercises. Maybe I can't remember what they were having them perform, but performing some tasks where they could objectively observe their performance. And three different groups, the first group.

01:32:32
<transcript>: they

01:32:35
<transcript>: They were like telling them.

01:32:35
<transcript>: how

01:32:39

01:32:44
mattmancodes: if it was on TikTok it won't be true

01:32:46
<transcript>: The second group, they were saying, oh, you're working so hard. And I don't know if you've heard that, but like, it's better just tell people or tell children that.

01:32:46
<transcript>: they work

01:32:58
<transcript>: They work hard, as opposed to. They're just inherently smart, because then if they're bad at something, they'll feel like they're just inherently bad at it. So rather like, oh, you're doing well because you're working hard. But then the third group was the best performance of all.

01:32:58
<transcript>: i'm

01:32:59
thdxr: I have brown parents who never complimented me. I think it works

01:33:08
<transcript>: I'm rushing through this so fast. The third group is the best performance. And all they did, the instructors would come up to them, the adults, and just give them a high five. They said nothing. And that was the kids that did best.

01:33:08
<transcript>: but in every measure

01:33:09
devagrawal09: @thdxr +1

01:33:10
<transcript>: But in every measureable way.

01:33:14
<transcript>: So just don't say anything to your kids. Just give them high fives.

01:33:14
<transcript>: that's it

01:33:16
<transcript>: That's it.

01:33:22
<transcript>: At least that's what TikTok said. I don't know. Okay, I'm gonna get back to work. I'm just gonna try and read really fast.

01:33:29
<transcript>: What are you trying to commit session. You. I love it. Darny. Thank you for the follow.

01:33:35
trivenge: i only say that because my parents were restrictive and did the opposite of that. as an autistic individual, it absolutely crushed me and i had to deal with trauma in my 20s from a lot of development and abuse problems. NotLikeThis  but it was so harmful to me as a kid, that my parents would not let me explore the passions i had, if i got too into something, they would pull me back. yeah, gentle encouragement for the things they do good. i like it

01:33:38
<transcript>: Met my wife at work, too. I think I know the story. Next. She was head of product. I was head of engineering. A classic story. A product. And engineering never worked so well. That's funny.

sathyabhat: @thdxr are you me? lol

01:34:19
<transcript>: I absolutely crushed me and I had deal with trauma in my 20s. Ooh. I really love hearing stories from people that have trauma. I hate the trauma for you, but it's it's helpful as a parent to hear things that people did.

01:34:19
<transcript>: that really

01:34:29
<transcript>: That really scarred people, because then I know, like, I need to steer clear of that. So I'm sorry for your pain, but I'm glad you told me and you're open about it because it's helpful.

01:34:43
<transcript>: To me as a kid. My parents, my parents would not let me explore the past. I had got into something. They would pull me back. General. Courage of things. I do. Good. Yeah. I love it. I love it. You're reinforcing what I think I've been learning.

01:35:01
<transcript>: that's it

01:35:05
<transcript>: That's it what we've figured out. Dambles. Here.

01:35:30
<transcript>: Okay, let's start implementing. Let's start writing some code. I don't know. Is it code? If it's a sheet Mountain css, someone tell me. I think it is. I think that is code.

01:35:30
<transcript>: can't remember what

01:35:33
bebenzer: @Kryotoboi classic

01:35:35
<transcript>: Can't remember what the right answer is to is HTML code.

01:35:35
<transcript>: markup

01:35:36
devagrawal09: yes html is a programming language

01:35:49
<transcript>: Markup. I don't know. I feel like if I can make this taller, it would be very helpful. Or this is what I need right here. So we have class tabs. Class tab. We have an input. Is this input hidden? No, it's checked. So the first one is checked.

01:35:53
<transcript>: Does not do hide it about here. We hide it somewhere.

01:36:00
<transcript>: I feel like the radio is hidden. Z index is two.

01:36:01
<transcript>: Opacity.

01:36:01
<transcript>: one okay

01:36:04
<transcript>: One. Okay, so content.

<transcript>: okay

01:36:08
thdxr: how are all of you going to meet partners if you wfh

<transcript>: Great.

01:36:24
thdxr: how's that going

01:36:26

01:36:29

<transcript>: mba

01:36:32
<transcript>: Mba Box Score We're just gonna start authoring it here.

mattmancodes: not well by the sound of it

01:36:35
devagrawal09: terrible lol i get no replies

01:36:38
<transcript>: And then we'll, like, pull it out into a component. Once I figured it all out.

01:36:40
kryotoboi: @thdxr giving me stress

01:36:48
<transcript>: Let's see team stats, players at So this is a tab right here.

01:36:53
<transcript>: That is a tab currently an H three tag.

01:36:54
yeltrah_: I'm married to my first tinder date

01:36:57
<transcript>: So when you click Player stats.

01:37:01
<transcript>: Bonus points if we can get the little animation.

01:37:02
thdxr: i had a gf for 5 years who I lived with before I met my wife...there may have been some overlap

01:37:11
<transcript>: A little animation from side to side. We probably can with just css, and then we'll have a css only tab component that's accessible and that.

01:37:11
<transcript>: is not

01:37:16
<transcript>: Is not a react app because this is currently react app. We will have improved statues in so many ways.

01:37:16
<transcript>: so this

01:37:18
<transcript>: So this whole stream is gonna be worth it.

01:37:19
thdxr: was pretty hard untangling that

01:37:27
devagrawal09: oooff

01:37:31
yeltrah_: Tell me more @thdxr

01:37:33
<transcript>: I'm trying to ignore all the juicy relationships that you guys are talking about, but it's really hard when you're saying things like that. Dax.

01:37:33
<transcript>: time to ignore

01:37:35
<transcript>: Time to ignore it.

01:37:35
<transcript>: trying so hard

01:37:36
<transcript>: Trying so hard but I can't.

01:37:36
<transcript>: go for five years

01:37:38
<transcript>: Go for five years you lived with 40 meters.

01:37:38
<transcript>: maybe some overlap

01:37:41
<transcript>: Maybe some overlap. For that. It sounds super hard.

01:37:41
<transcript>: to untangle

01:37:43
<transcript>: To untangle.

01:37:43
<transcript>: i was lucky

01:37:46
<transcript>: I was lucky in that I've had very few relationships in life.

01:37:49
<transcript>: Like very few.

01:37:53
mattmancodes: This tab is never getting built

01:37:53
<transcript>: High School. I had like two girls.

01:38:05
jenswoeste: according to chatgpt, html is not a programming language: "HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to create web pages  and web applications. It is not considered a programming language as it is used  to structure content and provide semantic meaning to the data on a web page but  does not perform mathematical or logical operations."

01:38:05
thdxr: I used to date ur mom

01:38:05
zachrip: thanks for keeping a11y in mind, people often forget about that in the quest to eliminate js

01:38:06
<transcript>: I had like a friend that was like my friend for all of high school, that we were pretty close and everyone thought we were a boyfriend girlfriend. But we weren't. So I was shielded from a lot of, like, relationship pain. I think.

01:38:09
yeltrah_: Friends with benefits eh @adamdotdev

01:38:19
<transcript>: Okay, playerstands. Tasks. Tab. Time to do something. Class tabs. Class tab. Input radio. So let's just start doing this. I'm gonna make these not H streets. Why are they aged threes? I wonder.

01:38:21
<transcript>: Seems kind of weird.

01:38:26
<transcript>: We're just gonna make them divs.

01:38:28
kryotoboi: I think it would have been a problem if there was an overlap after you married your wife

01:38:31
<transcript>: And I don't remember how to rename tabs. So I'm just gonna do this.

01:38:33
<transcript>: Like that.

01:38:36
<transcript>: Okay. So they're all divs.

01:38:36
<transcript>: divsive

01:38:38
<transcript>: Divsive.

01:38:43
<transcript>: Oh, that's for Little. That's a little animation thing.

01:38:43
<transcript>: a little

01:38:46
<transcript>: A little indicator of which yeah, Yeah.

01:38:49
oetziofficial: Is it weird if I say, I never tried astro and dont know why there is a hype?

01:38:49
<transcript>: Syndicates which one is.

01:38:49
<transcript>: selected like

01:38:51

01:38:58
<transcript>: Get rid of that. There's no indicate. Yep.

01:38:58
<transcript>: okay

01:39:00
<transcript>: Okay.

mecoupz: bad adam using inline css with tailwind :D

01:39:16
kryotoboi: Did anyone here try learning ActionScript back in the day ?

01:39:16
yeltrah_: I still haven't tried Astro, Rust, and or Solid honestly..

01:39:16
<transcript>: This. How can I how can I not have to keep tabbing through all these things? Like, I need to just copy this somewhere that I can constantly see it.

01:39:16
<transcript>: maybe

01:39:18
<transcript>: Maybe.

01:39:29
<transcript>: This tab is never getting built. Matt.

01:39:29

01:39:30
<transcript>: Come on now.

01:39:30
<transcript>: let's have

<transcript>: Optimism. I'm ignoring all of the information about.

01:39:36
<transcript>: about

01:39:41
<transcript>: About relationships that is so juicy. And I want to read it all. I'm ignoring it.

01:39:41
<transcript>: so what about this

01:39:43
trivenge: has anyone tested to see if bun is actually better than deno or node.js as much as they claim?

01:39:44
<transcript>: So, what about this, the CSS.

01:39:44
<transcript>: what about

01:39:53
<transcript>: What about this being sas is going to screw me like it's part of this gonna be harder because I'm not using sas or no, maybe not.

01:39:53
<transcript>: i don't know

01:39:56
<transcript>: I don't know. Are they doing anything that's not just straight css here.

01:40:01
devagrawal09: nesting

01:40:03
thdxr: sass is dumb

01:40:03
<transcript>: I ask that question really fast, like you would just process it all and tell me the answer, but that's probably not gonna happen.

01:40:03
<transcript>: nest

01:40:04
trivenge: their benchmarks just seem fishy to me

01:40:04
mattmancodes: the nesting

01:40:06
barryxbtw: only nesting

01:40:06
<transcript>: Nesting. Oh, I can't nest in CSS.

01:40:12
<transcript>: Oh, no. What's? Nesting? Only. Nesting. Sounds amazing. Sounds important. What is nesting.

beeut: parent { child: {} }

01:40:29
thdxr: unwinding nesting is easy just have to include the parent in the rule

01:40:41
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. So I just have to define it as like a separate. I could do that. I think I could figure that out. Okay. We're not gonna actually write this as css. I'm just gonna try it all into tailwind because I like pain. I don't know why I do that to myself, but unwinding nesting is easy. Just have to include what? Prayer. Okay. Cool. I think I'm just gonna eat my Lar bar and not do the whole like.

01:40:41
<transcript>: the whole

01:40:48
oetziofficial: Is astro mainly for static pages? Or can I add dynamic content too?

01:40:49
<transcript>: The whole fanfare around it. Is that okay with everybody? If I don't do the whole transition thing, that's like lara Bar time. Can I just eat it.

01:40:51
thdxr: no do it

01:40:51

01:41:03

devagrawal09: i don't know how people eat and just wipe their hands with paper napkins and go on with their lives without washing

<transcript>: Okay.

01:50:59
<transcript>: normally i would

01:50:59
mecoupz: but dont tell my wife :D

01:51:03
<transcript>: Normally I would read every single message in chat, but we got too much to do.

01:51:06
<transcript>: Too much to do.

01:51:09
<transcript>: People like that stuff they call it a.

01:51:17
<transcript>: We all do it. But don't tell my wife. Yeah, exactly. My wife ever watches my Twitch stream? She'll be the.

01:51:19
<transcript>: Chewing? Am I eating.

01:51:23
<transcript>: Okay. We have not Typed near enough today.

01:51:29
<transcript>: Not even keycasters not even running I gotta automate this because I always forget.

01:51:31
<transcript>: Okay.

01:51:40
<transcript>: All your stats. So the one of our divs. I need. I need a faster feedback loop here. I need a way to keep this stuff in view.

01:51:45
<transcript>: I might cover chat with it. That'd probably be good for productivity.

01:51:51
<transcript>: I'm gonna move this over. I'm gonna move this code over here where I can see it.

01:51:55
<transcript>: And you guys don't see it, but I can't see your chat.

01:51:55
devagrawal09: do it

01:51:57
kryotoboi: LUL

01:51:58
<transcript>: And I'll actually get something done.

01:51:58
<transcript>: okay

01:51:59
<transcript>: Okay.

01:52:06
<transcript>: So these are each tabs. Let's just humor this thing and it's give them.

01:52:06
<transcript>: a class

01:52:07
<transcript>: A class.

01:52:10
<transcript>: Of tab.

01:52:11
thdxr: he's putting chat away???

01:52:15
thdxr: that's messed up

01:52:20
<transcript>: Even if I don't, I'm not. I'm not gonna write silent here. I just want to remember. These are tabs. I'm trying to mirror. And then this top level thing is tab.

01:52:20
<transcript>: okay

01:52:21
<transcript>: Okay.

01:52:21
<transcript>: tabs

01:52:23
<transcript>: Tabs Tab tab.

01:52:23
<transcript>: and then this is just

01:52:27
<transcript>: And then this is just an indicator which we'll deal with later.

01:52:27
<transcript>: i think there's another

01:52:27
kryotoboi: We're being ignored YouWHY

01:52:32
<transcript>: I think there's another way we could do that, but I guess they're animating it. So I see why they did it this way. Okay.

01:52:36
<transcript>: Team stats, playerstapped.

01:52:39
<transcript>: I need to add an input radio.

01:52:44
<transcript>: And a label. Okay, I'm just gonna copy this whole structure, actually.

01:52:50
<transcript>: And then this is the.

01:52:57
<transcript>: Click Capital D. That.

01:53:02
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. Team stats.

01:53:09
<transcript>: The class content, and then we have label for tab one.

01:53:09
<transcript>: i guess i

01:53:12
<transcript>: I guess I need an ID on this. Let's tab one.

01:53:16
<transcript>: They didn't have any I. Ds.

01:53:16
<transcript>: that's

01:53:18
<transcript>: That's weird.

01:53:22
<transcript>: Doesn't this only work if it's the ID.

01:53:25
devagrawal09: i'm gonna cover the stream with my vscode window in protest

01:53:29
<transcript>: Label I'm looking at the four element I contain control as long as the four attribute points to the container control element.

01:53:33
<transcript>: Like, doesn't that mean this ID? What did I just do.

01:53:36
<transcript>: What did I just do.

01:53:39
<transcript>: Tab one.

01:53:45
<transcript>: Doesn't. I mean, this should be like, I. D. Equals tab. One.

01:53:45
<transcript>: right

01:53:46
<transcript>: Right.

01:53:46
<transcript>: feel like that should

01:53:48
<transcript>: Feel like that should be a thing.

01:53:51
<transcript>: I. D. Equals tab.

01:53:51
<transcript>: ta

01:53:54
<transcript>: Tab two, I don't know my crazy.

01:54:00
devagrawal09: you already have the id=tab1 in the input

01:54:01
<transcript>: Let's just yank inside the tag and let's go.

01:54:05
<transcript>: Like that.

01:54:05
<transcript>: that

01:54:08
<transcript>: That Player stats.

01:54:12
<transcript>: Oh, the label is labeled visible.

01:54:16
thdxr: @devagrawal09 haha

01:54:17
<transcript>: Wait, was these labels.

01:54:22
<transcript>: Label. One tab. One content. Oh, that's the content.

01:54:22
<transcript>: oh it's

01:54:23
<transcript>: Oh, it's the content.

01:54:27
thdxr: I use a tiling window manager I can't cover anything with anything

01:54:30
<transcript>: Interesting. So this is the this is the team stats. Right here.

01:54:30
<transcript>: and then this is

01:54:32
<transcript>: And then this is gonna be all the stuff.

01:54:35
<transcript>: Okay.

01:54:35
<transcript>: play

01:54:37
<transcript>: Player.

01:54:37
<transcript>: at

01:54:38
<transcript>: At.

01:54:38
<transcript>: and

01:54:40
<transcript>: And then.

01:54:42
<transcript>: Okay.

01:54:43
<transcript>: Interesting.

01:54:43
<transcript>: so

01:54:48
<transcript>: So that's not what I was thinking. I just wasn't thinking very well.

01:54:53
<transcript>: Use the titling Window measure. You can't cover anything with anything.

01:54:53
<transcript>: yeah

01:54:54
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:54:54
<transcript>: dev says

01:55:01
<transcript>: Dev says you already have the ID tab. One in the input. Oh, I do. Oh, there it is. Oh, I see. So it's.

01:55:05
<transcript>: That wouldn't have made sense if they paste an example. It didn't work.

01:55:05
<transcript>: so the

01:55:10
<transcript>: So the I see the input is the thing. That it's. Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense. Okay.

01:55:10
<transcript>: team sat

01:55:12
<transcript>: Team Sat. Player stats.

01:55:12
<transcript>: in the

01:55:13
<transcript>: In the content.

01:55:13
<transcript>: i'm going to take

01:55:16
<transcript>: I'm going to take all this content down here. This is actually.

01:55:16
<transcript>: great

01:55:19
<transcript>: Great, this is the.

01:55:23
<transcript>: Team set. This is it it's this day. Right here.

01:55:23
<transcript>: so let's just download

01:55:28
texoport: @thdxr tabbed/stacked mode would disagree with you xD

01:55:28
<transcript>: So let's just download that and let's drop it in the team stats, content.

01:55:30
<transcript>: Okay.

01:55:37
<transcript>: So now we're just some css away from a functioning css tab component. I think.

01:55:39
kryotoboi: Oh the great fortune tellers in chat, do you see Astro becoming big enough ? I really need to switch to something that's gonna be big tomorrow, this old school angular is killing me

01:55:41
devagrawal09: i need to play with tiling, my window management is way too adhoc

01:55:43
<transcript>: I'm not positive, but I think, oh, that should be tab. One should be two.

01:55:45
<transcript>: And that should be.

01:55:49
<transcript>: Nope.

01:55:49
<transcript>: one

01:55:49
dexkopf: What did you end up using for the tab component?

01:55:49
<transcript>: One.

01:55:49
<transcript>: no

01:55:54
<transcript>: Nope. That should be two. Okay. That was really hard.

01:56:01
overra_dev: css

01:56:02
thdxr: he decided to not do any work for the last hour

01:56:04
<transcript>: I need to play with my tiling my window management is two ad hoc? Yeah, I need to tighten mine up? It's pretty bad we're being ignored.

01:56:05
thdxr: so you didn't miss anything

01:56:07
<transcript>: Sorry, everybody. We're actually getting something done.

01:56:07
<transcript>: amp

01:56:13
<transcript>: Amp arm. Thank you for follow. Nine minutes ago I was probably on break and I didn't notice.

01:56:18
<transcript>: I'm gonna cover the stream of my vs. Code and process that's funny.

01:56:29
<transcript>: What did you interview? We're using css. So vera are in a unit. You're the one that answered, dex. That's right side to not do any work for the last hour. So you didn't miss either.

01:56:33
<transcript>: It's true.

01:56:33
<transcript>: okay so

01:56:36
<transcript>: Okay. So let's let's just see what we have here.

01:56:44
<transcript>: That is awful. And it has a radio button. And we haven't done the styling yet. So of course, it's awful. But if I go here.

01:56:50
<transcript>: Still nothing different because we haven't styled why can't I select it, though.

01:56:53
<transcript>: We got some work to do.

01:56:53
<transcript>: oh i

01:56:59
<transcript>: Oh, I did. I selected. It just doesn't do anything. So we haven't done the CSS yet. Let's do the CSS.

01:57:02
thdxr: @Kryotoboi for content sites yeah 100% I'm always going to use astro

01:57:03
<transcript>: The thing with the css, it's gonna make all this work.

01:57:12
<transcript>: So radio okay.

01:57:12
<transcript>: it's time

01:57:13
<transcript>: It's time.

01:57:13
<transcript>: name ta

01:57:16
<transcript>: Name Tab Group. What's that about.

01:57:22
<transcript>: So these have name tab group.

01:57:24
<transcript>: Okay.

01:57:32
<transcript>: So I get for copying.

01:57:34
<transcript>: Okay.

01:57:34
<transcript>: so let's

01:57:41
<transcript>: So let's look at the styles, and I just can't nest. So tabs, that's this right here.

01:57:41
<transcript>: we're gonna just replace

01:57:43
mecoupz: how many cameras does adam use? every time i look here there is another view

01:57:44
<transcript>: We're gonna just replace that with relative.

01:57:44
<transcript>: and

01:57:45
<transcript>: And.

01:57:45
<transcript>: min

01:57:47
<transcript>: Min height.

01:57:47
<transcript>: min height

01:57:49
<transcript>: Min height.

01:57:49
<transcript>: i don't know

01:57:53
<transcript>: I don't know. Do I need height? We'll see that might not be needed.

01:57:55
thdxr: he's kind of obsessed with himself

01:57:59
<transcript>: I'm gonna just go ahead and do this so that it's over there where I can see it. Okay.

01:58:02
thdxr: needs 5 cameras looking at him at all times

01:58:03
<transcript>: Has anybody ever gotten Astro with prettier.

01:58:08
<transcript>: Working with the auto sort plugin. I wish I could auto sort.

01:58:14
<transcript>: Content sites? Yeah, 100% I'm always going to use astro. Yeah.

01:58:14
<transcript>: oh what

01:58:24
mecoupz: tailwind has a prettier plugin for sorting

01:58:25
<transcript>: Oh, what was the question? Oh, crime cryo. Oh, the great fortune tellers in Chat. Well, I don't need to read it, actually, because zach is on top of it. How many cameras does that music? Every time I look here, there's another view.

01:58:35
overra_dev: I'm not an a11y expert but I think ARIA roles will improve accessibility with screen readers with these CSS tabs https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Tab_Role

01:58:35
<transcript>: Yeah. Taylor has a prettier plugin for sorting. I just don't. I don't think it works in Astro.

01:58:35
<transcript>: be wrong

01:58:37
<transcript>: Be wrong.

01:58:37
<transcript>: oh he does i

01:58:41
<transcript>: Oh, he does. I should be having it work. I should get that working.

01:58:41
<transcript>: maybe

01:58:45
<transcript>: Maybe it does work. Maybe there's nothing. Maybe I made this up.

01:58:49
<transcript>: Here it is.

01:58:53
<transcript>: Is it not work? Why did I disable it.

01:58:56
thdxr: adam doesn't care about a11y he's a bad person

01:59:00
<transcript>: Did all that work, and then it's just it's just comment it out.

01:59:00
<transcript>: if it works

01:59:01
<transcript>: If it works.

01:59:03
<transcript>: Safe.

01:59:05
<transcript>: I have to restart.

01:59:05
<transcript>: what i

01:59:06
mecoupz: no thats for sorting imports not tailwind classes

01:59:07
<transcript>: What I have to restart though.

01:59:11
<transcript>: What I would have to restart pretty or D somehow.

01:59:14
<transcript>: Fear? D.

01:59:20
mecoupz: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss

01:59:21
<transcript>: Restart I don't know if my lsps thing that is formatting anymore.

01:59:21
<transcript>: i'd probably have to

01:59:24
thdxr: I usually just kill prettierd from the cli

01:59:24
<transcript>: I'd probably have to actually restart in them.

01:59:26
<transcript>: I don't know I have no idea.

01:59:32
<transcript>: No idea. Am I? What file am I in.

01:59:32
thdxr: but I also don't use the prettier lsp

01:59:36
thdxr: should I switch to that

01:59:38
<transcript>: Box. Where? Here we go.

01:59:38
<transcript>: okay

01:59:39
<transcript>: Okay.

01:59:43
<transcript>: So we're doing tabs. Here we go.

01:59:43
devagrawal09: i usually don't have to do anything because i use vscode

01:59:48
<transcript>: It is not sorting. So I'm just gonna forget about it for now.

01:59:54
<transcript>: Adam doesn't care about Alice. He's a bad person. I do care about accessibility.

01:59:54
<transcript>: area

02:00:03
<transcript>: Area roles to improve accessibility with screen readers with the css tabs. Yeah. We're gonna make sure accessibility is good. We're gonna make sure it's good on this thing when we're done here.

02:00:03
<transcript>: that's

02:00:10
<transcript>: That's for sorting imports, not tailing classes. Oops, I have the wrong plugin. I just looked at it too quickly.

02:00:14
<transcript>: Sort imports. Yep. Sure enough.

02:00:18
<transcript>: Why I can't read my conference.

02:00:18
<transcript>: marine

02:00:20
<transcript>: Marine Conference Not the best.

02:00:23
overra_dev: coffee time

02:00:25
<transcript>: Usually just kill pretty Ord from the cli. Also don't use a prettier lsp.

02:00:33
<transcript>: Usually don't have to do anything because I use vs. Code.

02:00:36
<transcript>: That's true deaf.

02:00:41
<transcript>: It kind of hurts when I remember how much time I invested to in them.

02:00:46
<transcript>: But I.

02:00:52
<transcript>: 'm Back to it, so Tab is just gonna be float left.

02:00:57
<transcript>: So replace that with float.

02:00:57
<transcript>: left

02:00:58
<transcript>: Left.

02:00:58
<transcript>: and

02:01:00
<transcript>: And then.

02:01:12
<transcript>: Look at all the lsp stuff I'm getting now that I switched to dab dax's Dot File setup, tab, label.

02:01:12
<transcript>: has

02:01:14
mecoupz: it just works™

02:01:18
<transcript>: Has a top value so tab label let's see.

02:01:20

02:01:40
<transcript>: See if I improved anything.

02:01:42
<transcript>: Nope. Not yet.

02:01:47
<transcript>: Or maybe I'm not sure. Actually.

02:01:53
<transcript>: No, nothing's. Nothing's. Better yet. Okay.

02:01:57
<transcript>: I don't know if I did the styles right. That's the question I should look at.

02:01:57
<transcript>: inspect

02:02:01
<transcript>: Inspect and see, did I do those styles? Right.

02:02:01
<transcript>: inspect

<transcript>: The Float lab.

02:02:12
<transcript>: Float left is correct and then.

02:02:15
<transcript>: Label.

02:02:19
<transcript>: Label is top. So if I go to the label component.

02:02:23
<transcript>: It should have top one emr. Okay, something's wrong.

02:02:28
<transcript>: Position static property prevents top from having effect.

02:02:28
<transcript>: so it's

02:02:30
<transcript>: So it's not absolute or anything.

02:02:30
<transcript>: oh

02:02:32
<transcript>: Oh, wait, wait.

02:02:37
<transcript>: Is there somewhere else where we're saying that it's.

02:02:41
nzlaura: @Kryotoboi this brings back memories i tried to forget

02:02:44
<transcript>: Yeah, that's a good point. Pop doesn't work.

02:02:44
<transcript>: unless

02:02:47
<transcript>: Unless it's like absolute or something, right.

02:02:54
<transcript>: Okay, I'm gonna ignore it for now.

02:02:57
<transcript>: I'm gonna ignore it for now.

02:03:03
<transcript>: Just curious.

02:03:05
<transcript>: Just keep going.

02:03:05
<transcript>: set the

02:03:07
<transcript>: Set the label height.

02:03:07
<transcript>: pop

02:03:08
33nasser: why are your books backwards?

02:03:09
<transcript>: Pop gonna set the height.

02:03:09
<transcript>: i don't know

02:03:13
<transcript>: I don't know let's just do this one so type radio.

02:03:16
<transcript>: How do I do that.

02:03:19
<transcript>: This is gonna be so ugly in tail end.

02:03:21
<transcript>: And.

02:03:25
<transcript>: Type equals range. Can I just do that.

02:03:25
<transcript>: type equals radio

02:03:28
<transcript>: Type equals radio. Can I do that.

02:03:30
<transcript>: Let's try it.

02:03:34
<transcript>: This is gonna be hideous. I should probably.

02:03:34
<transcript>: i should

02:03:39
thdxr: @yeltrah_ buy me dinner first omg

02:03:39
devagrawal09: looks like it's the z-index thing that actually makes the tabs work

02:03:40
<transcript>: I should probably not do it this way because I'm had to copy that little selector thing for every single property, right.

02:03:52
<transcript>: 33. Nasa. Why are your books backward? Great question. My wife said they would look better that way. So the backward.

02:03:54
yeltrah_: @yeltrah_ Bro I don't live in New York anymore

02:03:57
<transcript>: It's the Z index thing that actually makes the tab work. Okay.

02:04:04
<transcript>: The check Tweet label. Z. Index two is the index one, right. Okay, we'll get there.

02:04:10
thdxr: I used to live in NY

02:04:12
thdxr: where did you live

02:04:18
<transcript>: I'm trying to side if I should I should actually write some some just actual css. This would go a lot faster.

02:04:18
<transcript>: then

02:04:23
<transcript>: Then translating it all to tailwind.

02:04:23
<transcript>: but

02:04:23
yeltrah_: Across the tiny pond...live in UK

02:04:26
<transcript>: But let's see if that works.

02:04:30
yeltrah_: You?

02:04:31
devagrawal09: that's a sentence you don't hear often

02:04:34
thdxr: Miami

02:04:34
<transcript>: So now anything with type radio, this thing should have that style. If I did it right, I did not do it right.

02:04:37
<transcript>: Now.

02:04:37
yeltrah_: Eww

02:04:44
yeltrah_: You like it?

02:04:46
<transcript>: Okay. So that didn't work. Maybe I'll just write css. What do we think.

02:04:46
thdxr: https://github.com/thdxr/environment

02:04:48
<transcript>: What do we think.

02:04:57
devagrawal09: oh you're speaking at react miami right

02:04:58
<transcript>: I'm just gonna write CSS.

02:04:59
thdxr: my dotfiles aren't good so idk if people should be looking at them too much

02:05:03
thdxr: I love Miami

02:05:09
<transcript>: I'm just gonna put it in this global file because I'm bad at everything. I don't know where else to put it. What is all this? Oh, this is all actual stat me stuff.

02:05:13
<transcript>: Okay. I don't know. I don't love it.

02:05:13
<transcript>: but

02:05:13
thdxr: @devagrawal09 yeahhh I'm the home representative

02:05:16
<transcript>: But this is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna just put it right here.

02:05:16
<transcript>: i'm just gonna copy it

02:05:18
<transcript>: I'm just gonna copy it off. Just like this.

02:05:22
<transcript>: Who needs tailwind when you can just do this.

02:05:22
devagrawal09: niceee im gonna be there

02:05:26
thdxr: ohh nice

02:05:31
<transcript>: Oh, but I can't nest you said I have to.

02:05:35
thdxr: Adam is going to see if he can go too

02:05:36
<transcript>: I also probably can't do comments. I feel like that's not valid.

02:05:44
devagrawal09: got a free ticket from michelle

02:05:44
<transcript>: That's not valid. Okay.

02:05:44
<transcript>: so this one

02:05:46
<transcript>: So this one needs to have.

02:05:48
<transcript>: What.

02:05:50
thdxr: how do you know her?

02:05:50
<transcript>: Tab.

02:05:54
<transcript>: Hype. Radio.

02:05:54
<transcript>: and then like

02:05:57
<transcript>: And then like that someone tell me that's, right.

02:05:58
devagrawal09: from last year's react miami lol

02:06:00
<transcript>: All right.

02:06:06
<transcript>: Did I do it.

02:06:10
<transcript>: I do it that way. Is that the nested way to do it.

02:06:13
<transcript>: Okay.

02:06:14
thdxr: ohh

02:06:18
<transcript>: See what it looks like? Awful. So bad.

02:06:21
mecoupz: should be without > & and the space inbetween i guess?

02:06:21
<transcript>: Not functional.

02:06:24
thdxr: I've talked to he ra bunch but never actually met her in person

02:06:26
<transcript>: Let's go back to our oh, I remember those classes, though.

02:06:28
<transcript>: So let's do this.

02:06:31
<transcript>: Legally.

02:06:36
<transcript>: Tab.

02:06:36
<transcript>: and

02:06:38
<transcript>: And then this is.

02:06:41
thdxr: do you know anyone else that's going?

02:06:42
<transcript>: Tabs.

02:06:46
<transcript>: Thank you so much for that. Follow kajoni.

02:06:48
<transcript>: Could.

02:06:52
<transcript>: This isn't great.

02:06:56
<transcript>: Not the best.

02:06:59
<transcript>: What's going on here.

02:07:02
<transcript>: Content.

02:07:05
<transcript>: Then I have all this content.

02:07:09
<transcript>: What did I miss.

02:07:13
<transcript>: Are you sure there's not something else about sas that I did? That you can't do.

02:07:13
<transcript>: and

02:07:15
<transcript>: And CSS.

02:07:15
devagrawal09: other than all the speakers, probably not, i wasn't great at networking back then

02:07:19
<transcript>: Inspect.

02:07:25
<transcript>: Are these are the styles even on this stuff.

02:07:28
<transcript>: Label input type radio.

02:07:34
<transcript>: Okay. There's our yeah. There's our like get rid of all the stuff.

02:07:37
<transcript>: So that works float like.

02:07:43
<transcript>: Something's not working.

02:07:52
<transcript>: Hey, could you guys talk, stop talking about React Miami and tell me what I'm doing wrong. Oh, should be without that. And the space in between, I guess.

02:07:52
<transcript>: oh me coupe

02:07:53
<transcript>: Oh, Me coupes? Thank you so much.

02:07:58
<transcript>: So you're saying not that.

02:08:02
<transcript>: Like this.

02:08:02
devagrawal09: no

02:08:06
<transcript>: And I can just do it like that.

02:08:18
sj_se: its like this and like that and like this

02:08:21
mecoupz: without the &

02:08:25
<transcript>: It's like this. Like that. Like this. Okay.

02:08:29
devagrawal09: we'll stop talking about react miami once you tell us you're coming

02:08:32
<transcript>: Focus plus label like that.

02:08:34
mecoupz: i think you need to add ":focus" right after the css class

02:08:41
<transcript>: Still not working. You need to add focus right after the css class.

02:08:41
<transcript>: oh

02:08:42
<transcript>: Oh.

02:08:50
<transcript>: That tab like that.

02:09:27
thdxr: st petersberg is supposed to be nice af

02:09:33
thdxr: dude do it

02:09:43
devagrawal09: @Samkebih no there's supposed to be a space after .tab

<transcript>: Just like that.

02:10:06

<transcript>: If it's.

02:10:14
daglee: But won't you be a florida man for 1 month?

02:10:16
<transcript>: The wrong thing. It might still be other things. I've not done right. Looks like I've not done other things.

02:10:22
samkebih: @devagrawal09 I just entered the stream, I usually do the way I wrote I do not know the whole code

02:10:23
<transcript>: Supposed to be a space after dot tab. Oh, here.

02:10:23
<transcript>: we're gonna get

02:10:25
thdxr: I'm florida man 4 life

02:10:26
<transcript>: We're gonna get it everybody, we're gonna get it.

02:10:31
<transcript>: It still looks really weird. And I don't know. I feel like it's not doing something.

02:10:31
<transcript>: it's not doing

02:10:32
<transcript>: It's not doing.

02:10:32
<transcript>: the

02:10:35
dnbull: i have 2 alligators as pets Kappa

02:10:37
<transcript>: The opacity to zero or something like those. Shouldn't those be.

02:10:40
<transcript>: From this whole thing be zero.

02:10:42
<transcript>: And Let's.

02:10:43
<transcript>: Check.

02:10:43
<transcript>: unless

02:10:46
lazy_developer: come to south of italy… you are not going to want to leave

02:10:48
<transcript>: Unless it's checked. So the check. But I can't check the other one.

02:10:48
<transcript>: can't

02:10:50
<transcript>: Can't seem to check it.

02:10:53
dnbull: im not florida man but im 305 till I die LUL

02:11:00
<transcript>: Oh, I checked it. I did it. Do you see that somehow I was able to check it very hard to click on it not feeling very accessible.

02:11:02
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:11:05
<transcript>: Oh, look at this. It works. It's successful.

02:11:05
<transcript>: kind of

02:11:12
<transcript>: Kind of we got to do some area tag stuff. So there's lots of problems. But we have the start of the tab control.

02:11:17
<transcript>: Do it come here and never go back interesting.

02:11:17
<transcript>: that's

02:11:19
devagrawal09: let'sgooooooo

02:11:21
<transcript>: That's an interesting proposal. You know, we did live in naples for six months.

02:11:22
<transcript>: You don't.

02:11:22
<transcript>: be a

02:11:28
<transcript>: Be a Florida man but won't you be a floor demand for one month? I would be dagly? I would be.

02:11:37
<transcript>: Samka, I just entered the stream. I usually do the way I wrote. I do not know the whole code. You're good. Thank you so much. I really appreciate the help.

02:11:37
<transcript>: dax is the floor

02:11:39
<transcript>: Dax is the floor demand for life.

02:11:43
mecoupz: dude you're making me want to stream

02:11:48
<transcript>: Two alligators as pets from the south of Italy. You're not going to want to leave. Oh, interesting. Is it nice there lazy.

02:11:54
<transcript>: I'm not a floor man, but I'm 305 till I die. What's, 305.

02:11:56
<transcript>: Plus 305.

02:12:00
<transcript>: I'm making you want to stream me, coops. Alright.

02:12:00
<transcript>: do

02:12:05
adamdotdev: !discord

02:12:05
fossabot: Adam is a member of the watch.dev Discord server and he'd love to see you there: https://discord.gg/watchdotdev

02:12:06
thdxr: I don't have an alligator but I have a doberman with a gold chain as a pet is that 305 enough

02:12:09
kedemel: I'm in Ohio, aka North Florida.

02:12:13
<transcript>: Do it. Enjoy the watch dev server. Join our discord server. Me and back started this discord server for devs that want to stream but don't want to have our own discord server, but they still want to hang out with people when they're not streaming.

02:12:13
<transcript>: that's

02:12:14
lazy_developer: that’s what happened to me anyway…

02:12:16
<transcript>: That's the elevator pitch.

02:12:23
<transcript>: Don't have an alligator, but I have a doberman with a gold chain of the pet. Is that through five? Enough.

02:12:30
<transcript>: Oh, Hi. Oh, okay. North Florida. That's funny.

02:12:38
<transcript>: So lazier, you from the US and you moved to south of Italy and you never want to go back.

02:12:38
<transcript>: it would be

02:12:49
devagrawal09: i'm in cincinnati which is technically in ohio but spiritually in california

02:12:50
<transcript>: It would be so hard to move internationally. Just look, kids, I just can't imagine it just like everything changes. Like your whole world being kind of turned upside down. That was the thing. Like we moved to Florida for six months with my oldest was four.

02:12:50
<transcript>: and

02:12:55
thdxr: imagine your kids with an italian accent

02:12:57
<transcript>: And just like we had a really nice house here in the ozarks. We had built. Not this one different. One, same neighborhood, though.

02:12:57
<transcript>: we love

02:12:58
lazy_developer: no… bulgaria but same principle

02:13:07
<transcript>: We loved it, everything about it. And then we moved to this little rental in Florida, and it was sadi and grimy. And it was just like everything in your life has now changed.

02:13:07
<transcript>: it was tough

02:13:18
<transcript>: It was tough, emotional for all of us. Just felt like none was familiar. I can't imagine moving across the ocean into some place you've never been where everything is literally different.

02:13:23
<transcript>: I'm in Cincinnati, which is technically in Ohio, but spiritually in California.

02:13:28
dinisskizee: I'm in my first job, trying to progress as fast as possible and my company has multiple projects to choose from, I've practiced react so far and would like to get into backend and AWS more, there's an opportunity for me to join a Go role, what would you guys say about it? I want to be a well rounded person around the whole application lifecycle, I'm worried that Go wouldn't really lead me in that direction because I'm clueless, thoughts? uff long...

02:13:32
<transcript>: It's really funny. Imagine your kids with an Italian accent. That'd be kind of cool, actually.

02:13:35
<transcript>: Bulgaria but same principle.

02:13:35
<transcript>: i'm in my

02:13:37
<transcript>: I'm in my first job trying to progress.

02:13:37
<transcript>: as fast

dinisskizee: bombed chat sry

02:13:39
<transcript>: As fast as possible.

02:13:47

02:14:00
<transcript>: Okay.

02:14:00
<transcript>: there's

02:14:00
devagrawal09: @thdxr LUL

02:14:16
devagrawal09: run away from frontend

02:14:16
<transcript>: There's an opportunity we'd like to get into back in and eight of us more. There's an opportunity for me to join a Go roll. What would you guys say about it? I want to be a wellrounded person around the whole application lifecycle. I'm worried that Go wouldn't really lead me in that direction because I'm clueless thoughts long you're five.

02:14:19
<transcript>: Bomb chat. You're fine.

02:14:24
<transcript>: So there you go. Zach says get into more backend stuff ASAP.

02:14:29
<transcript>: Run away from front end. Cincinnati, Aka North Kentucky.

02:14:29
<transcript>: you guys

02:14:30
thdxr: I live in miami we like backends

02:14:32
<transcript>: You guys all have funny takes about Ohio, and I'm here for it.

02:14:34
<transcript>: Okay.

02:14:39
dinisskizee: thanks :)))

02:14:40
<transcript>: So what do we need to do here? We need to figure out why I can't click on it. I feel like the view below.

02:14:43
<transcript>: It's. This thing is like, Oh.

02:14:46
<transcript>: I bet this is a simple thing actually.

02:14:47
typosrry: @lazy_developer I lived in Cagliari for three months, not exactly in South Italy, but it was so awesome! I loved to work from there.

02:14:47
rudixworld: @lazy_developer здрастЕ

02:14:49
<transcript>: It's never a simple thing, is it.

02:14:49
<transcript>: so this

02:14:52
<transcript>: So this background primary needs to be.

02:14:56
<transcript>: On the tab themselves.

02:15:00
<transcript>: Like this.

02:15:07
<transcript>: And then this one, I guess as well I could put it on the tab.

02:15:07
<transcript>: i really

02:15:09
<transcript>: I really hate how I'm doing this.

02:15:12
<transcript>: Really hate it.

02:15:17
<transcript>: Did that not fix the background primary issue.

02:15:23
<transcript>: Background primary.

02:15:27
<transcript>: There are not remove it. No, I did. What.

02:15:31
<transcript>: What's going on? Background. Primary. This.

02:15:35
<transcript>: Here should be like background, white or something. I don't know.

02:15:38
<transcript>: I'm not going to set a background on it.

02:15:44
<transcript>: But if I did, does it work.

02:15:49
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. The whole tab. Okay. So the whole tab.

02:15:52
<transcript>: Still. No, it shouldn't be the whole tab. Yeah, Here's.

02:15:52
<transcript>: so

02:15:54
<transcript>: So it should be.

02:16:00
<transcript>: This radio where I don't know where is the part that just.

02:16:04
<transcript>: I don't love this, I don't love it.

02:16:04
<transcript>: i need to

02:16:06
<transcript>: I need to just understand.

02:16:06
devagrawal09: @dinisskizee if it's your first job doesn't matter too much, go into whatever, try it out, feel it out for a few months then see if you wanna stick to it or switch to something else

02:16:14
<transcript>: The mechanism here for turning like toggling the tab and then just strip everything else out because I don't like the way these are styling.

02:16:18
<transcript>: Content.

02:16:25
<transcript>: How do I have a nested Div like that? Okay, fine.

02:16:28
devagrawal09: you'll gain valuable experience regardless of what technology you're working with

02:16:33
<transcript>: Is this going to be like relative or something.

02:16:38
<transcript>: I'm guessing I'm guessing.

02:16:41
<transcript>: It kind of worked, it did something.

02:16:44
<transcript>: What am I doing.

02:16:44
<transcript>: i

02:16:46
<transcript>: I removed the background color.

02:16:50
<transcript>: That's a problem. Background. Primary.

02:16:59
<transcript>: I don't want the whole thing. The content pain should be oh, here we go. This should be.

02:17:02
<transcript>: Background whites or something.

02:17:07
<transcript>: Right? What in the world.

02:17:10
<transcript>: This is hard.

02:17:13
<transcript>: I love it.

02:17:21
<transcript>: So hard. What is it about that divs? It's not like living inside the content. Well.

02:17:22
dinisskizee: @dinisskizee I dont want to try out stuff I want to nail it first try every time, I put a lot of time into researching what to do to make the best choices ever, cant just take the least :p

02:17:28
<transcript>: Okay. I'm going to.

02:17:35
dinisskizee: and I have my end goal, need to stick to the plan :p

02:17:42
<transcript>: I'm going to just scrap all that stuff I just wrote, like, all the css. I'm just getting rid of it. I'm just gonna figure out how to do this with the mechanism, the trick that they're using for css stuff.

02:17:42
<transcript>: so

02:17:45
<transcript>: So tab one checked.

02:17:48
<transcript>: Label for Tab One, and then.

02:17:53
<transcript>: Content which I'm going to.

02:17:57
<transcript>: I don't need a class on that either.

02:18:01
<transcript>: Okay. Here's what I'm doing. I'm gonna handle this myself.

02:18:03
<transcript>: Doing it myself.

02:18:10
<transcript>: So all of these classes are going away. I'm just gonna get really smart.

02:18:10
<transcript>: and do it

02:18:12
<transcript>: And do it myself.

02:18:16
<transcript>: So this is.

02:18:16
<transcript>: the

02:18:17
<transcript>: The.

02:18:19
devagrawal09: LUL

02:18:24
<transcript>: This could be the problem. It's I was not assuming the content would be inside of this when I did this.

02:18:32
nzlaura: @dinisskizee perfect is the enemy of good

02:18:32
<transcript>: Come back to our style.

02:18:37
<transcript>: So all of this is what I need.

02:18:42
<transcript>: Figure out how to smartly do the thing.

02:18:42
<transcript>: i should just

02:18:45
<transcript>: I should just go ahead and delete them out of here. Right.

02:18:55
<transcript>: So we delete that out.

02:18:55
<transcript>: and then we're

02:18:59
<transcript>: And then we're just gonna, like, paste it in here somewhere, so I can just see it.

02:19:03
thdxr: @dinisskizee my entire career was me randomly doing stuff with zero plan

02:19:06
laytanl_: Heyo!

02:19:08
<transcript>: Okay. Now I've got this reference.

02:19:12
<transcript>: Back and forth.

02:19:12
<transcript>: so the

02:19:14
thdxr: and usually not doing what everyone said you should do

02:19:16
<transcript>: So the tabs are relatives. I have a min height. I don't love that.

02:19:16
<transcript>: but

02:19:19
laytanl_: Statmuse done yet?

02:19:21
<transcript>: But I get why it would be relative, I guess. Is there some absolutely positioned.

02:19:21
<transcript>: anything

02:19:23
<transcript>: Anything.

02:19:23
<transcript>: why are they

02:19:31
<transcript>: Why are they floating? I haven't used float in, like three years. Why would they use float? I just. I don't want much of this. I don't like it. I don't like it.

02:19:32
dinisskizee: @thdxr and you nailed it :) full of shortcuts and everything ahahah

02:19:39
<transcript>: Stemmy's done yet late, not quite hey, oh, latency.

02:19:54
<transcript>: I don't love that they're floated. I just don't like wy float. So the real trick here is it's a radio is checked.

02:19:55
devagrawal09: a lot of it is just styling to make it look good you should be able to ignore most of that

02:19:57
<transcript>: And we set zero.

02:20:02
devagrawal09: like floats

02:20:02
thdxr: just hard to plan long term, just have to say yes to every opportunity that shows up and it'll work out

02:20:03
<transcript>: Of the label.

02:20:03
<transcript>: to two

02:20:05
<transcript>: To two.

02:20:07
daglee: Maybe it floats their boat?

02:20:10
<transcript>: Is the content nested inside the label? No, it's not.

02:20:17
<transcript>: Okay. I don't like Z index either. I feel like they're using all the things from css. I don't like to use.

02:20:19
devagrawal09: @thdxr im gonna say impossible to plan long term

02:20:22
thdxr: adam it's time for a brek

02:20:22
<transcript>: So content is absolutely positioned. There's one of the problems.

02:20:22
<transcript>: why

02:20:26
<transcript>: Why, why is it absolutely positioned? Why can I not just say.

02:20:26
<transcript>: like

02:20:28
<transcript>: Like.

02:20:28
<transcript>: display

02:20:29
<transcript>: Display hidden.

02:20:29
<transcript>: or

02:20:31
<transcript>: Or something.

02:20:31
<transcript>: or display

02:20:33
<transcript>: Or display? None.

02:20:33
<transcript>: and then

02:20:35
stupac62: it's been 8 years since I touched front end. You're making me never ever want to touch it again haha

02:20:36
<transcript>: And then display block.

02:20:36
<transcript>: you know i'm saying

02:20:41
<transcript>: You know, I'm saying, what can I just do it that way? Time for a break deck. So I just got started.

02:20:52
<transcript>: Maybe it floats her boat. That's a good one. Good dad joke. Just hard to plan. Longterm. Just have to say yes to every opportunity that shows up, and it'll work out. That's a actually great advice tax. We should do a podcast on that.

02:21:06
<transcript>: I think that's what I did in life. I just said yes to everything. Until eventually, I had so many options that I only wanted to do the ones I wanted to do. And I got paid a lot of money to do it. I feel like that was really it. It's been eight years since I touched front end. You're making me never want to touch it again. Yeah.

02:21:08
thdxr: yeah if you asked me 5 years ago I don't think I would have known I'd be doing so much AWS stuff, working on a game show, and spending time editing video

02:21:10
<transcript>: Who likes frontend.

02:21:10
<transcript>: lying

02:21:11
<transcript>: Lying.

02:21:19
<transcript>: If you ask me five years ago, I don't think I would have known I'd be doing so much aw stuff. Working on a game show and spending time editing video. Exactly.

02:21:26
<transcript>: The longer my career goes, the weirder it gets, the more random things I seem to be doing.

02:21:33
<transcript>: Also having more fun than ever. Okay, here's how we're gonna do this. We're saying we can figure this out. We're smart.

02:21:33
<transcript>: first

02:21:34
<transcript>: First.

02:21:37
<transcript>: I mean you all are.

02:21:41
thdxr: lol adam yesterday I watched every between 2 ferns episode.....and it was work related

02:21:41
<transcript>: You're smart enough to get me there where I need to be.

02:21:41
<transcript>: let's see

02:21:42
thdxr: W T F

02:21:44
vapor__dev: If I have to make one more drop-down or modal…

02:21:50
<transcript>: Let's see. We have a label, we have a radio button. And the key mechanism is we can style stuff based on whether that radio button is checked.

02:21:58
stupac62: I heard somewhere that we can expect to have like 5 "careers" in our lifetime. Makes sense to me.

02:22:01
<transcript>: If that's it. That's the whole thing. I do need to hide the radio buttons. So I do need to do this with the radio buttons, all of this. So I'm gonna do that right now.

02:22:03
<transcript>: So radio.

02:22:08
<transcript>: Radio. Is this one? Right here, right.

02:22:12
<transcript>: So we're gonna say.

02:22:14
<transcript>: Class.

02:22:18
<transcript>: Is absolute. It said, I think.

02:22:20
<transcript>: Absolute.

02:22:23
<transcript>: Let's actually move this down.

02:22:28
<transcript>: Absolute.

02:22:39
<transcript>: Height zero with the zero overflow hidden.

02:22:41
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:22:44
<transcript>: And clip.

02:22:46
<transcript>: And I do clip.

02:22:48
<transcript>: Flip.

02:22:48
<transcript>: zero zero

02:22:50
<transcript>: Zero zero kind of do this.

02:22:54
<transcript>: Probably not can't do that until then. Probably.

02:23:04
<transcript>: Adam, yesterday I watched Every Between Two ferns episode, and it was work related.

02:23:06
<transcript>: That's awesome.

02:23:07
vapor__dev: Confucius said we have two lives. And the 2nd one begins when we realize we only have one… adamdo8DealWithIt

02:23:07
typosrry: I still don't know how to build good UI / UX. I'm happy to work on backend/frontend code, but I can't make it work regarding styling.

02:23:13
<transcript>: Okay. So I hid this one. I did not hide the other one. That's okay. We haven't gotten that yet.

02:23:13
<transcript>: i feel like

02:23:18
<transcript>: I feel like the clickability of this is terrible. Was the example better.

02:23:22
<transcript>: The clickability not so great.

02:23:25
<transcript>: It works on this one. Now.

02:23:26
<transcript>: Okay.

02:23:28
<transcript>: Hey.

02:23:32
<transcript>: Wonder what I did wrong to make those not clickable.

02:23:49
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, it does. It's just a cursor. Maybe it's just weird. Okay, we'll fix it.

02:23:53
<transcript>: Oh, because we have this Hover cursor pointer.

02:23:53
<transcript>: maybe i

02:23:55
<transcript>: Maybe I should remove that.

02:24:01
<transcript>: I'm just getting crazy. I'm just deleting stuff.

02:24:07
<transcript>: Oh. So the problem is.

02:24:07
<transcript>: it

02:24:11
thdxr: I wish I only had to do backend

02:24:13
thdxr: life would be SO GOOD

02:24:18
<transcript>: It's inconsistent. Like there it goes to the pointer. I don't know what's going on here. I think we just want the whole thing to be the little hand. What's that called? Pointer? Yeah. We just want the whole thing to be.

02:24:22
<transcript>: A cursor pointer like that.

02:24:25
<transcript>: That's the wrong area.

02:24:25
<transcript>: i really got to

02:24:32
<transcript>: I really got to figure out where these tab headers live, in the dom or in this markup. Like I can't figure it out.

02:24:32
<transcript>: i wish

02:24:35
<transcript>: I wish I only had to do back in life would be so good? Yeah it would.

02:24:35
<transcript>: allen

02:24:44
<transcript>: Allen's here. Confucius said, we have two lives. And the second one begins when we realize we only have one ooh, that's deep SM.

02:24:44
<transcript>: smart

02:24:45
<transcript>: Smart.

02:24:48
<transcript>: Deep enough to understand that even.

02:24:48
<transcript>: but it feels

02:24:51
<transcript>: But it feels good to hear it, you know.

02:24:55
<transcript>: Some of the things. There's a lot of things I don't understand that. I hear that it.

02:24:55
<transcript>: feel better

02:25:04
<transcript>: Feel better or smarter or something from hearing it alone. I don't know what that mechanism is. There's probably some psychological effect someone has named.

02:25:04
<transcript>: i'm gonna remove

02:25:11
<transcript>: I'm gonna remove the clip thing because I don't think it's actually doing anything. I guess I could inspect it on. I can inspect it and see if it's doing anything.

02:25:21
<transcript>: It's a clip doing anything that'd be cool if I just nailed it first try. Nah.

02:25:28
<transcript>: How can you do clip and tail end. Let's see. I don't know if I need it, but he'll win.

02:25:28
<transcript>: clipwreck

02:25:29
stupac62: when you're alone you have time for introspection. You don't around others. IMO

02:25:30
<transcript>: Clipwrecked.

02:25:33
<transcript>: Background clip.

02:25:40
<transcript>: Nope.

02:25:43
<transcript>: Clip.

02:25:54
<transcript>: Do you think, do I need the clip? I don't know if I need it. Feels like it's working without it.

02:25:57
<transcript>: Just because I'm in Chrome or something.

02:26:08
<transcript>: Okay, go wrong.

02:26:12
<transcript>: Okay. We hid the thing.

02:26:12
<transcript>: and now

02:26:13
<transcript>: And now.

02:26:15
schrew: help neovim people - how do I externally copy text out of nvim? Until I can open slack in nvim, I've got to copy paste the old fashioned way

02:26:16
<transcript>: We're gonna do the let's see.

02:26:20
<transcript>: The content.

02:26:25
<transcript>: Content should be hidden. Let's just hide it.

02:26:30
<transcript>: Flynn. Right? Yeah. Nope.

02:26:37
<transcript>: Here we go. This is hidden.

02:26:40
<transcript>: This is the content.

02:26:43
<transcript>: And.

02:26:43
<transcript>: that works

02:26:44
<transcript>: That works.

02:26:44
<transcript>: yes

02:26:45
<transcript>: Yes.

02:26:47
<transcript>: And no.

02:26:47
<transcript>: just have this little

02:26:51
<transcript>: Just have this little indicator way down here. That's weird.

02:26:54
<transcript>: But now we want to show it.

02:26:54
<transcript>: if

02:26:55
<transcript>: If.

02:26:58
<transcript>: Okay. So here's how we're gonna do this.

02:27:04
<transcript>: Class hidden we're gonna say that's the only Div nested inside.

02:27:07
<transcript>: I think I can just style it that way. Maybe.

02:27:07
<transcript>: it's based

02:27:09
<transcript>: It's based on what it's basically.

02:27:13
<transcript>: Oh, it's like a sibling, though.

02:27:13
stupac62: @Schrew here. :h clipboard

02:27:16
<transcript>: It's a sibling.

02:27:18
<transcript>: How am I gonna do that.

02:27:22
<transcript>: How did they do it.

02:27:22
<transcript>: they're styling

02:27:23
<transcript>: They're styling.

02:27:28
premiare: Group?

02:27:29
<transcript>: What are these? Little? Is that a sibling? That means little, squiggly.

02:27:33
<transcript>: Group. Oh, I could use groups. Okay.

02:27:36
devagrawal09: yeah sibling

02:27:36
<transcript>: I could use groups.

02:27:39
<transcript>: So how do I do this if I want to say.

02:27:39
<transcript>: like here

02:27:48
<transcript>: Like, here's a condition where we're gonna do block. This condition would be what? How can I do a sibling condition? Yeah, sibling. So.

02:27:48
<transcript>: like if

02:27:49
stupac62: @Schrewlook for unnamedplus. are you using init.vim or init.lua?

02:27:51
<transcript>: Like if I want to say sibling.

02:27:54
<transcript>: Type radio.

02:27:54
<transcript>: check

02:27:55
<transcript>: Check.

02:27:58
<transcript>: Just imagine that's possible.

02:27:58
<transcript>: how would i

02:28:00
<transcript>: How would I do that.

02:28:02
juniornascm: Good morning everyone

02:28:03
<transcript>: Amen now.

02:28:04
schrew: @stupac62 using lua!

02:28:06
<transcript>: That's what I want.

02:28:06
<transcript>: good morning

02:28:08
<transcript>: Good Morning, junior.

02:28:11
<transcript>: A sibling, sibling, sibling.

02:28:16
<transcript>: So let's do this. Let's do tailwind.

02:28:19
<transcript>: Arbitrary.

02:28:19
<transcript>: arbitrary

02:28:20
<transcript>: Arbitrary.

02:28:20
<transcript>: select

02:28:22
<transcript>: Selector? Sibling.

02:28:29
<transcript>: Oh, look at this. Look at this.

02:28:31
physotronic: what are you using for Vim? is that default terminal or you are using something else?

02:28:34
<transcript>: Somebody's got my example.

02:28:34
<transcript>: here

02:28:37
<transcript>: Here's a complex variant I wrote for this purpose.

02:28:40
<transcript>: I feel like I don't need a.

02:28:40
<transcript>: that do i

02:28:41
<transcript>: That do I.

02:28:44
<transcript>: Sibling selector variance. Here we go. Group.

02:28:46
physotronic: btw have you tried out Bing AI chat?

02:28:48
<transcript>: Peer checked, pure checked. I can just do peer check.

02:28:49
stupac62: @Schrew i think you add this then vim.opt.clipboard = "unnamedplus"

02:28:50
<transcript>: Are you kidding me.

02:28:54
<transcript>: It's that simple? Is it that simple.

02:29:00
<transcript>: You're checked block. Oh, my word. If that works.

02:29:06
<transcript>: I'm gonna be so pumped.

02:29:12
stupac62: depends on OS though. So read that help

02:29:15
<transcript>: I did something wrong, but I think we're on the right track. Is that a real thing? Peer checked.

02:29:21
<transcript>: Simply marked a previous sibling you're interested in with the peer class. I have to add peer.

02:29:24
<transcript>: Oh, I'm almost there.

02:29:32
<transcript>: And then peer checked.

02:29:36
<transcript>: Oh.

02:29:36
<transcript>: oh

02:29:40
<transcript>: Oh, it works. Oh, this is so easy.

02:29:40
<transcript>: this is

02:29:43
<transcript>: This is so easy. The styling is awful, but it works.

02:29:43
<transcript>: it works

02:29:46
schrew: @stupac62 Thank you Thank you! I'll give it a go

02:29:48
<transcript>: It works. I feel like we need a break, but I'm not going to put through we're gonna make this thing look good now.

02:29:50
thdxr: BREAK BREAK BREAK

02:29:52
<transcript>: Can you believe it? I can believe it was that easy.

02:29:52
<transcript>: peer checked

02:29:53
stupac62: @Schrew you may need to install a package like xclip (linux) or something depending on OS and what is installed

02:29:53
<transcript>: Peer checked.

02:29:53
<transcript>: break

02:29:57
<transcript>: Break, right? Break. What do you want to do, dax? Like what would do if I take a break.

02:30:01
thdxr: idk

02:30:04
<transcript>: I mean I could I just don't know. Like, do we have stuff to talk about.

02:30:05
ali___999: im sry wut is that code editor?

02:30:06
<transcript>: I don't know.

02:30:06
thdxr: go on twitter?

02:30:15
thdxr: I just made a major confession

02:30:16
vapor__dev: BREAK

02:30:17
<transcript>: Ali. First. I'm chatting. Welcome to Chat. I'm sorry. What is that? Code editor? It is Neil vim. Go to Twitter. Good. Good idea, dax. Let's do Twitter. Let's just get on Twitter.

02:30:17
<transcript>: let's

02:30:20
<transcript>: Let's do Twitter. Here we go.

02:30:28
devagrawal09: twitter's boring

02:30:32
schrew: oh lord he's made a twitter transition LUL

02:30:33
<transcript>: Here we go, Twitter time we get to see how bad my.

02:30:33
<transcript>: my

02:30:43
<transcript>: My for you and my following tabs are oh mode design. So now that's some good tweets. I love mode keyboards so much I did true. I made a Twitter transition.

02:30:47
coolpantstv: production quality putting @thdxr to shame

02:30:47
<transcript>: I have a problem.

02:30:53
thdxr: hey wtf

02:30:53
<transcript>: Instead of using AI to write an email that they're recipient, then uses AI to summarize, what if we all just wrote shorter emails.

02:31:01
thdxr: adam you have a aws heroes list AND a serverless heroes list?

02:31:04
<transcript>: I don't use emails. Does anyone use email? I don't do the inbox zero thing. I don't read emails. I just skim and look for things that are important.

02:31:04
<transcript>: and we

02:31:04
mattmancodes: hope there's no more milking farm videos

02:31:10

02:40:44
<transcript>: Okay, let's open up some more tweets. You guys are messing with me. That's not real.

dnbull: fine supabase is another serverless database (postgres) an alternative to firebase.

02:40:55
uberrick: This is the definition of tech debt as a road

02:40:55
<transcript>: How a single line bug cost us $2,000 in a debs. Then we recently factor a lamb function since we tested its functionality, release interaction, everything still worked as expected. Then the billing alarm went on.

02:40:58
<transcript>: So the thing about.

02:41:01

02:41:13
<transcript>: Pure serverless.

02:41:13
<transcript>: like event

02:41:17
thdxr: $2000 that's nothing - I had an inefficient thing in SST2 that cost someone $6000

02:41:23
<transcript>: Like Eventbridge inventory invocation counts and Lambda functionification counts like they do huge volume. So it makes sense that if they make a tiny mistake, it's gonna cost a lot of money.

02:41:28
thdxr: felt so bad

02:41:32
laytanl_: PostNL rejected my resume NotLikeThis

02:41:35
<transcript>: I love the way Luke breaks that down. He dies into stuff. I am not that smart. Okay, let's see. Dev, you have another one, Sebastian lore. But let's see what this is.

02:41:45
<transcript>: You guys could start posting tweets that are interesting in our watch dev discord. That'd be fun. And we could just like, pull from those and talk about them on stream.

02:41:49
<transcript>: Signals versus react make up your mind.

02:41:51
<transcript>: Interesting.

02:41:57
<transcript>: How? Let's see, how does this make sense? So react.

02:42:19
tayloreddev: how forgiving are AWS in these situations

02:42:32
<transcript>: Let's see. Or is the same one. I just like that.

02:42:32
<transcript>: yeah i didn't

02:42:37
devagrawal09: and everything moves slow

02:42:38
<transcript>: Yeah. I didn't dive too deep into the details here. If you process as many.

02:42:46
aj_stuyvenberg: one of my first serverless mistakes was creating an infinite loop w/ Lambda, SNS, SQS, and elasticsearch which caused 4k in lambda spend before catching it

02:42:46
<transcript>: Events as post NL then like they made 176,000,000 calls to secrets manager get secret value.

02:42:52
<transcript>: It's not easy to fall into because you have to have a very large application with a ton of volume.

02:43:01
typosrry: @PhysoTronic FB is the most used social media platform everywhere, but it has a totally different target audience.

02:43:04
<transcript>: Like his situation is unique in that way. So I would say, could you be calling Get Secret value way too much? Sure. That's easy to fall into. Will it matter and will your costs go up? Probably not.

02:43:16
<transcript>: Definition of tech debt. Debt as a road. If you want silly traffic, look up the Magic roundabout in the UK. Okay, now I'm curious. Magic roundabout. You've.

02:43:18
vapor__dev: Jeff bezos saw that and was like hehe I’m rich now!

02:43:21
<transcript>: Been but it's this.

02:43:23
<transcript>: Stone, stone.

02:43:30
<transcript>: That looks super confusing. Thanks so much for following.

02:43:32
<transcript>: H.

02:43:39
<transcript>: You had an inefficient thing in ssd that cost someone $6,000. Are you serious? What was it? Dax.

02:43:40
physotronic: typosrry I just went and checked data on statcounter. 79.35% while twitter is even behind Instagram on 5.3%. Data is from February

02:43:42
<transcript>: Post. And I'll reject your resume. I'm sorry, leighton. I would hire you.

02:43:42
<transcript>: if i

02:43:51
<transcript>: If I were hiring when I was literally broke, I accidentally spent $500 on keep and had to call and beg them not charge me. Oh.

02:43:51
<transcript>: you're still

02:43:52
<transcript>: You're still broke.

02:43:52
<transcript>: ouch

02:43:54
<transcript>: Ouch.

02:43:58
<transcript>: How forgiving or athibis in these situations. I don't know. Like.

02:43:59
devagrawal09: ah yeah this is 5 small roundabouts between 2 large concentric roundabouts

02:44:16
thdxr: If you had a queue that was receiving events from a 3rd party source and you didn't have sst dev up, it would retry forever. Someone left it on over a weekend with slack messages as a source

02:44:18
<transcript>: In post and else case like this probably like a drop in their building bucket. So I don't know if they're fighting to get that. Like they probably just accepted, took the L, and like, we spent $2,000 because we're done not dumb. Luke's never done, but because we made a mistake. Like, I'm sure they just took that one if it's like a huge bill and it's a small account, like.

02:44:18
<transcript>: an individual

02:44:21
<transcript>: An individual. I think they're pretty forgiving I think they work with people.

02:44:26
<transcript>: It makes sense because reacts is way too many cars and the highway is probably choked.

02:44:26
<transcript>: and everything

02:44:31
<transcript>: And everything moves slow. Exactly. Dev. I love that. That's a nice take.

02:44:31
<transcript>: what

02:44:34
<transcript>: What was that? Tweet. That was the other one. I lost it.

02:44:42
thdxr: it's fixed now!

02:44:43
<transcript>: One of my first service was creating an infinite loop with Lambda snss, sqs and elastic search, which cost 40 Lambda spin before catching it. Oof.

02:44:43
<transcript>: ooh

02:44:44
<transcript>: Ooh.

02:44:46
<transcript>: See.

02:44:51
<transcript>: Jeff bezos saw that and was like, I'm rich now.

02:45:00
<transcript>: Okay, you guys talking about stuff? Oh, yeah. This is five small randomest between two large cassetric roundabouts. That looks awful. That the UK thing.

02:45:00
<transcript>: if you

02:45:12
<transcript>: If you had a cue that was receiving events from a third party source and you didn't have SSC Dev up, it would retry forever. Someone left it on over a weekend with a slack message as a source. Oof fix now good to know.

02:45:12
<transcript>: i've not

02:45:23
<transcript>: I've not noticed. The problem with my A. Debus accounts is I have so many credits in them, but I'll never notice. I don't set up building alarms. I don't know. Like I'll just never notice. I know.

02:45:23
<transcript>: my spend

02:45:27
<transcript>: My spend on AWS when I see the like the charge on my card.

02:45:27
<transcript>: so

02:45:35
<transcript>: So someday I'm gonna burn through all my credits without knowing it? And I'm gonna have a charge on my car and be like, oh, I thought I had credits? Oh, I had an instant loop or something.

02:45:43
<transcript>: What is this? Mayhule, J. S. After putting any everywhere and wondering why production broke.

02:45:51

<transcript>: you're still here

02:46:01
<transcript>: You're still here on twitch. I know you're from twitch and Twitter. Sometimes. I don't know that. I just think I know people that have the same name, but I think it's the same person.

02:46:01
<transcript>: same ahol

02:46:02
<transcript>: Same Ahol.

02:46:03
<transcript>: ahold

02:46:04
<transcript>: Ahold.

02:46:15
<transcript>: When it comes to how I know Joe dickson, I follow so many people that I just don't even know who they are. Lariva. That's how I don't know. Okay. When it comes to method signatures containing an acronym, are you Team A or Team B.

02:46:15
<transcript>: oh

02:46:23
<transcript>: Oh, oh, I'm actually Team B on this. I don't like when casing looks like that. Thanks. Richard. Filed the frozen.

02:46:30
laytanl_: Yah b

02:46:34
mecoupz: definitely b

02:46:36
<transcript>: Anybody with me here? I just hate when you have. I know it's an acronym. I know. It probably should be Cap. I don't know. I just think it looks nicer when it flows. Like a little roller coaster. Coaster.

02:46:36
<transcript>: screw like that

02:46:37
<transcript>: Screw like that.

02:46:41
<transcript>: B. Definitely be okay. Cool. I feel better.

02:46:41

02:46:44
mattmancodes: both make me feel dirty

02:46:46

02:46:50
<transcript>: yeah

02:46:53
<transcript>: Yeah, Jack, I hope you found prime school.

02:46:53
<transcript>: excellent

02:46:56
<transcript>: Excellent data structures and algorithms. Course.

02:46:58
<transcript>: What would you add.

02:46:59
laytanl_: I don't like that a is 'PHPV'

02:47:01
<transcript>: Juice tweet.

02:47:01
<transcript>: that's

02:47:03
<transcript>: That's a cool place.

02:47:04
fusionplays: it's weird when the name has to start with an acronym though

02:47:11
devagrawal09: @mjewl this is interesting, thanks for sharing

02:47:13
fusionplays: you don't want it to start with an uppercase char LUL

02:47:18
<transcript>: a photo like this

02:47:26
<transcript>: A photo like this. The number of times I've, like, reset up everything and like, torn it all down and put it all back together. I know that feeling.

02:47:26
<transcript>: it's kind of fun

02:47:28
<transcript>: It's kind of fun, actually.

02:47:30
<transcript>: Okay.

<transcript>: they're really bad

02:47:36
laytanl_: I like snake case sometimes

02:47:36
<transcript>: They're really bad.

02:47:43
<transcript>: There's just nothing exciting here. I'm not seeing all the drama. You like snake case. Sometimes that's interesting.

02:47:50
<transcript>: Wb Smith sin shrillo. I mean, thank you so much for that follow. I appreciate it.

02:47:50
<transcript>: slow

02:47:52
<transcript>: Slow down.

02:47:52
thdxr: I think snakecase is objectively more readable

02:47:57
thdxr: wish it was the norm in js world

02:47:59
<transcript>: I need something spicy in my feed.

02:48:06
<transcript>: I like aver avers.

02:48:07
laytanl_: Yeah it's growing on me

02:48:12
<transcript>: I think Snake case is objectively more readable wish it was the norm in js world.

02:48:12
<transcript>: you know what i like

02:48:13

<transcript>: Eyelike.

02:48:20
vapor__dev: It’s objectively more readable but hard in jS cause you mix in all the camcelcase

02:48:22
<transcript>: Sorry, I'm reading stuff in Chat. I like.

02:48:24
physotronic: I would go with A because its easier to recognize acronym. When you see "PHP" i will recognize it right away, if I see "Php" it will take few seconds to connect dots

02:48:32
<transcript>: Kebab case. I wish I could use kabob case in my code files. I think it's the most aesthetically pleasing case. I use it for all my filenames because I can't use it anywhere else. It's not like valid.

02:48:32
<transcript>: it's like

02:48:35
<transcript>: It's like a variable name or something in JavaScript.

02:48:39
<transcript>: So if I could just like straight up, right.

<transcript>: I would do that all day long. I just think it looks so nice. Kebab Case, who's a fan? Anybody.

02:48:57
<transcript>: maybe

02:49:02
<transcript>: Maybe it would look terrible and cut. I'm just. I like it in file name. It's a lot.

02:49:02
kedemel: I like it.

02:49:07
vapor__dev: Kebab!?

02:49:23
mattmancodes: That's a sign of low larabar levels

02:49:25
<transcript>: I have opinion. I can have opinions, too. They might be bad.

02:49:37
<transcript>: File name's. Okay, but not encode. Okay, fine. That's a sign of low Larbar levels. You guys really don't like my kabob tape. Okay, good to know. Just work shopping that one. I won't expose that one to Twitter.

02:49:41
physotronic: you said before you dont have opinions Kappa

02:49:43
<transcript>: Why is there any.

02:49:43
<transcript>: good

02:49:45
laytanl_: Tweet it Kappa

02:49:45
<transcript>: Good.

02:49:54
mjewl: @mjewl It's a fun read

02:49:57
thdxr: I'm trying to clip it

02:50:00
vapor__dev: I’m clipping this and putting on twtr asap

02:50:40
<transcript>: My feet is just such a mixture of I think so far. Carrie dluffy.

02:50:40
<transcript>: it's such a mixture

02:50:45
<transcript>: It's such a mixture of like indie hackers Death dev streamers.

02:50:45
<transcript>: webdev

02:50:49
<transcript>: Webdevs aws, people.

02:50:56
<transcript>: That's what it is. It's those things.

02:51:00
<transcript>: And then Simon wordly, who fits in none of those things.

02:51:07
<transcript>: All right.

02:51:07
<transcript>: man dax

02:51:09
<transcript>: Man. Dax, you're in my feet a lot.

02:51:16
<transcript>: Okay.

02:51:21
<transcript>: I'm done with Twitter. We're done with Twitter.

02:51:23
<transcript>: We're gonna give back to work.

02:51:26
<transcript>: You do that around here? We work.

02:51:26
<transcript>: i can't believe

02:51:26
thdxr: https://clips.twitch.tv/InspiringKindWhaleDuDudu-9RgBYQPtGiS-o03K

02:51:30
<transcript>: I can't believe peer checked. That was it. It was just pure checked.

02:51:31
vapor__dev: Adam have you read Simon worldleys book

02:51:33
<transcript>: I feel so good.

02:51:37
<transcript>: Oh, it feels good. Bad taste. Exposed. Oh, no.

02:51:47
<transcript>: The clip. Have you read Simon wordley's book? No, I didn't know I had a book. Have you, Alan? That's so random. If you have.

02:51:47
<transcript>: i mean

02:51:49
<transcript>: I mean like.

02:51:54
<transcript>: I bet it's really long because he's very smart.

02:51:54
<transcript>: okay

02:51:57
<transcript>: Okay. So we got to do some stuff. We got a style.

02:52:02
<transcript>: This should I make like a component.

02:52:04
thdxr: Simon Wardley unfollowed me. Not only did he unfollow me he blocked and unblocked me to make me unfollow him

02:52:04
<transcript>: Should I make a component.

02:52:04
<transcript>: for tabs

02:52:07
<transcript>: For tabs. I probably should.

02:52:13
<transcript>: Simon wordly. Unfollowed. You. Not only did the unfolding he blocked and unlocked me to make me unfold.

02:52:15
mjewl: @devagrawal09 no, I don't remember where I found it from, but I was following the discussions around his post/presentation on computerenhance about Clean Code and it is a great follow up

02:52:17
<transcript>: What's that about? What did you do next.

02:52:20
<transcript>: What is that about.

02:52:23
thdxr: I have no idea

02:52:25
<transcript>: He was just. He decided it was in both of your best interests that you don't follow each other.

02:52:28
<transcript>: That's weird.

02:52:28
vapor__dev: Hahaha

02:52:32
<transcript>: Should I go and make a component like a tab component.

02:52:40
<transcript>: I think has some way of doing multiple slots.

02:52:40
vapor__dev: Maybe it’s in his book

02:52:43
<transcript>: Think I want to see this.

02:52:48
<transcript>: Slot I can't believe I have light mode on get out of here.

02:52:50
<transcript>: Slot.

02:52:55
<transcript>: Name slots. Yeah. You can have name slots. I want to use this.

02:53:00
thdxr: I think it was this

02:53:01
thdxr: https://twitter.com/thdxr/status/1633865420301008900

02:53:01
<transcript>: So after header. How's that work on the component side? So slot after header. How do I.

02:53:09
blakegreendev: you should send him a Wardley map of how to follow you again @thdxr

02:53:09
<transcript>: What if it's a huge component, though, that I want to I guess that would be the main slot. I'll just use the main slot. Okay. Okay.

02:53:09
<transcript>: i like this one

02:53:10
<transcript>: I like this one.

02:53:10
<transcript>: do i

02:53:13
<transcript>: Do I like this? Why would.

02:53:15
thdxr: lolol

02:53:18
<transcript>: So that's just a string. I want to see, like.

02:53:18
<transcript>: how would you do

02:53:20
<transcript>: How would you do a slide.

02:53:27
<transcript>: Oh, it can be it can be this so okay.

02:53:32
<transcript>: After footer. So this whole P gets dropped into.

02:53:32
<transcript>: this whole

02:53:35
<transcript>: This whole paragraph gets dropped into that slot. Okay.

02:53:39
<transcript>: Yeah? We're gonna try this? We're gonna make a component.

02:53:39
<transcript>: we're gonna

02:53:41
<transcript>: We're gonna call it tab.

02:53:41
<transcript>: tab

02:53:42
<transcript>: Tab.

02:53:42
<transcript>: just

02:53:44

02:53:57
<transcript>: Cinema wardly. Map of how to volley. That's funny. You think it was this? Oh, I gotta know. Next. What was it.

02:54:02
mecoupz: kebab-tabs.astro

02:54:02
<transcript>: You think this is what sized you for? Like on Ironically, you're not being stupid.

02:54:07
<transcript>: For real. For serious. I never used all statements. No.

02:54:07
<transcript>: he

02:54:10
<transcript>: He wouldn't unfollow you over that.

02:54:10
thdxr: no I'm being stupid

02:54:13
<transcript>: Kebab tabs, Astro.

02:54:16
<transcript>: That's funny.

02:54:16
<transcript>: okay

02:54:21
<transcript>: Okay, let's do this. Let's naming things the only hard part of my job.

02:54:21
<transcript>: tabs

02:54:24
<transcript>: Tabs, astro, whatever.

02:54:24
<transcript>: whatever

02:54:24
<transcript>: Whatever.

02:54:29
<transcript>: So let's just do this. Let's just.

02:54:36
<transcript>: Do that tag.

02:54:43
<transcript>: Okay. Hear me out. So we have a mostly I just want to not have to.

02:54:43
<transcript>: repeat these

02:54:49
<transcript>: Repeat these styles over and over. I guess the ids will have to be based on the index. Okay, that's fine.

02:54:59
<transcript>: To follow.

02:55:08
daglee: Not using else statements? I guess you never write haskell. :P

02:55:09
<transcript>: The follow. I appreciate it. So we're gonna have props. Let's just do this. Let's do interface.

02:55:10
<transcript>: Rock.

02:55:10
<transcript>: and

02:55:12
<transcript>: And extend.

02:55:12
<transcript>: it's like

02:55:16
<transcript>: It's like Astro HTML attributes or something.

02:55:16
<transcript>: extend

02:55:22
<transcript>: Extends html attributes? Yeah. There we go. Cool.

02:55:22
<transcript>: wow look at the pro

02:55:24
<transcript>: Wow. Look at the proactivity. We're gonna be flying around.

02:55:28
<transcript>: Things with follow debugging hub.

02:55:35
<transcript>: Debugging Hub. I appreciate it. Oh thanks for the follow her work. Sometimes they come in bunches follows due.

02:55:35
<transcript>: what's wrong with this

02:55:39
<transcript>: What's wrong with this? Oh, it requires a type argument. Oh, yeah, Yeah.

02:55:42
<transcript>: Div like that.

02:55:42
<transcript>: i think

02:55:46
<transcript>: I think that works. Yeah. Okay.

02:55:50
<transcript>: For this one, you're gonna pass in.

02:55:54
<transcript>: Tabs. No, we'll call it.

02:55:54
<transcript>: the

02:55:58
<transcript>: The control itself is called tabs, so it feels weird to have a text.

02:56:01
<transcript>: I hate naming things so much.

02:56:04
<transcript>: We'll say tabs. That's like the headers.

02:56:04
<transcript>: no

02:56:07
<transcript>: No, they should be a record.

02:56:09
<transcript>: No.

02:56:13
<transcript>: Why am I so bad at programming records.

02:56:13
<transcript>: string

02:56:14
<transcript>: String.

02:56:19
<transcript>: Now I want to use the slot thing, don't I.

02:56:22
<transcript>: How do I use slots here.

02:56:22
<transcript>: name

02:56:24
<transcript>: Name, slots.

02:56:24
<transcript>: no

02:56:33
<transcript>: No, they won't be named slots because I don't know the names ahead of time. They're dynamic. So it's like record string, and then like a component html, something.

02:56:38
<transcript>: Html element.

02:56:38
<transcript>: like that

02:56:40
<transcript>: Like that. Is that a way to do it.

02:56:45
<transcript>: I like, I'm really struggling here. Why am I struggling.

02:56:45
<transcript>: so

02:56:49
<transcript>: So I have a tab component I want to pass in.

02:56:52
<transcript>: A. List.

02:56:53
<transcript>: Of.

02:57:05
<transcript>: List of tab. This is going to look really weird in the markup. I'm trying to avoid this looking so weird in the markup.

02:57:05
<transcript>: like it's gonna

02:57:06
<transcript>: Like it's gonna look like.

02:57:07
ali___999: i have just finished my react in a nutshell tutorial instead of going through some 40 hours tutorial, trying to escape the tutorial hell, need some ideas for my personal projects, and some tips for my mindeset, going through this way, any help is appreciated, wish me luck

02:57:09
tqwewe: Wow the production quality here is insane!!

02:57:09
<transcript>: Tab.

02:57:09
<transcript>: tabs

02:57:09
vapor__dev: They did studies it is

02:57:15
<transcript>: Tabs. And there's gonna be like, tabs. And it's gonna be like this giant array of.

02:57:15
<transcript>: like

02:57:16
<transcript>: Like.

02:57:17
debugginghub: cool dolly shot

02:57:20
<transcript>: What it'd be like.

02:57:24
<transcript>: Tab one.

02:57:25
caaamel: <tabs options=...>

02:57:26
<transcript>: And then an element.

02:57:32
<transcript>: This is gonna look awful. I don't want it to look like this.

02:57:37
<transcript>: Thank you for joining Chat, everybody. You're all joining it once.

02:57:38
<transcript>: Dad.

02:57:38
<transcript>: all

02:57:51
<transcript>: Allie, I've just finished my reactant and that shell tutorial. Instead of going through some 40 hours tutorial trying to escape the tutorial hell need some ideas from a personal project and some tips for my mindset going through this way. Any helpers? Appreciate. Wish me luck.

02:57:51
<transcript>: chad we have

02:57:55
<transcript>: Chad, we have tips. I'm so bad with tips, so bad with them.

02:57:55
<transcript>: i

02:57:57
<transcript>: I know you should build things.

02:57:57
<transcript>: should definitely start

02:58:04
<transcript>: Should definitely start building things. Ideally, things you want to build like you want it to exist. Come up with something in your life.

02:58:04
<transcript>: that

02:58:09
<transcript>: That would be better if you had some software.

02:58:09
<transcript>: so for instance

02:58:24
<transcript>: So for instance, my wife wants me to make her a thing that helps us their shopping list because it's just a painful thing we have to do every single week. We have, like, a set of recipes we're gonna make that week. And we have to come up to shopping list and we have to organize it so that it's efficient to get through the store because we minmax life here at my house.

02:58:24
<transcript>: and

02:58:26
thdxr: use airtable

02:58:38
<transcript>: And she wants me to make a thing where she can, just, like, dump all her recipes into it, and it'll spit out our shopping list organized appropriately. So my wife wants not to exist. If my wife wants it to exist, I want it to exist. If I wanted to exist, I'll be motivated to get it done.

02:58:47
schererja: The wife factor :D lol

02:58:49
thdxr: you should host it at public.dev

02:58:53
<transcript>: So that helps a lot if you're just trying to make stuff for like the sake of making it like somebody said, make a Twitter clone. It's gonna be hard to push through and make it. You have to really want it. You want the end result of it. You can find something that you want. The end result.

02:58:53
<transcript>: whether that's

02:59:01
<transcript>: Whether that's organizing your kid's soccer game schedule or I don't know, just find some random thing in life that you want to try and improve.

02:59:01
<transcript>: and convince yourself

02:59:02
<transcript>: And convince yourself.

02:59:02
<transcript>: you need to be

02:59:10
<transcript>: You need to be really convinced you want it to exist, and then it'll be a lot easier to push through and find answers and figure out how to make it. That's my advice. I don't know if it's good.

02:59:15
vapor__dev: You gotta order it by store layout

02:59:22
<transcript>: Tq wee wee. Welcome to Chat. While the production play here is insane, it is a lot of production quality in one very short stream. Now it's not a short stream. It's 4 hours, but I've packed a lot of.

02:59:22
<transcript>: stuff

02:59:25
<transcript>: Stuff into this.

02:59:30
<transcript>: I'm appreciating you noticing Alan. They did studies. It is.

02:59:31
<transcript>: What are we talking about.

02:59:34
<transcript>: Oh, what is.

02:59:34
<transcript>: studies on

02:59:38
<transcript>: Studies on what cool dolly shot debugging have welcome to chat.

02:59:38
<transcript>: camel

02:59:41
<transcript>: Camel tabs option.

02:59:50
<transcript>: So the name is not so much the problem for me it's the what data structure am I passing in to pass all the content.

02:59:50
<transcript>: for the tab

02:59:51
ali___999: @adamdotdev thanks alot, im pretty sure it will be absolutely helpful

02:59:58
<transcript>: For the tab into this control. That's my problem, but welcome to Chat camel. Use Air Table The Y factor.

03:00:03
<transcript>: You should host it at public. Stop it, dax, stop it.

03:00:03
<transcript>: still

03:00:05
<transcript>: Still fresh? Still hurts.

03:00:05
<transcript>: got

03:00:12
<transcript>: Gotta order it by store layout. That's exactly right back. That's what we do lay out by the store. Yes.

03:00:15
<transcript>: Alie. I hope it is helpful. Good luck.

03:00:15
<transcript>: don't

03:00:16
<transcript>: Don't.

03:00:16
<transcript>: he

03:00:20
<transcript>: Hesitate to keep asking questions. We're here.

<transcript>: we like to answer that

03:00:21
<transcript>: We like to answer that.

karrydluffy: What is sst?

03:00:33
uberrick: whats happened with public.dev? :D

03:00:35
<transcript>: Someone tell me a tab control. Like, I would love. What I would love is to be able to say, like, tabs, and then, like, just put stuff. Oh, I could. I could have, like, tab.

03:00:35
<transcript>: and then

03:00:36
<transcript>: And then.

03:00:41
<transcript>: Title could be like tab could be like.

03:00:41
<transcript>: ta

03:00:46
<transcript>: Tab one, and then the child of this.

03:00:46
<transcript>: is just

03:00:46
thdxr: where are you guys seeing SST to ask "what is SST?"

03:00:48
thdxr: !sst

03:00:48
ayoungh: Have you got a camera on a slider?

03:00:50
<transcript>: Is just the content, right? That's what I wanted to look like.

03:00:53
<transcript>: That's what I want it to look like.

03:00:57
<transcript>: So how can my tab component know about chili that are tabs.

03:00:57
<transcript>: doesn't need to

03:01:00
<transcript>: Doesn't need to. Yeah, it does, because it needs to coordinate.

03:01:00
<transcript>: right

03:01:02
<transcript>: Right.

03:01:02
<transcript>: saddam

03:01:05
<transcript>: Saddam instructions. Such a way. Okay. So I need to know about the children.

03:01:05
<transcript>: or something

03:01:07
<transcript>: Or something.

03:01:09
<transcript>: I gotta figure out what I want to do here.

03:01:13
uberrick: @thdxr "and sst" in the title

03:01:16
<transcript>: What is ss T? There's an ssc command. Welcome to Chat, carrie. Dluffy.

03:01:19
thdxr: oh lol

03:01:24
karrydluffy: @thdxr It's in the title of the stream

03:01:34
karrydluffy: Thanks

03:01:35
<transcript>: What's happened? Public. Goddev, I don't want to talk about it. Sorry, Rick. I've shut it down. Where you guys seeing ssc? To ask what is ssd? Oh, it's in the title backs. Don't worry, dax. I'm looking out. I'm just driving people to SST every time I stream because I'm building set news with SST.

03:01:38

03:01:47
thdxr: it's working we're seeing a bump in the numbers

03:01:48
<transcript>: product

03:01:51
<transcript>: Production quality.

03:01:52
ayoungh: So coool

03:01:59
<transcript>: It's in the title stream. Think. Okay. Yeah. Welcome to Chat Salmon, Salman, Jolie.

03:02:01
ayoungh: How do you automate it

03:02:08
<transcript>: You did the ssc command. Okay, it's working. We're seeing a bump in the numbers. Are you serious? Actually. Dax, for real. So cool. How do you automate it.

03:02:08
<transcript>: it's just hotly on

03:02:11
<transcript>: It's just hotly on a loop? Moving around in my office.

03:02:12
thdxr: I need to get a second camera and focus it on my dog who is much better looking than me

03:02:19
<transcript>: And I just cut to that camera every few minutes. That's all I need to get a second camera and focus it on my dog. Who's my better looking.

03:02:26
ayoungh: Sweeet

03:02:30
<transcript>: That's funny. So next, no joke. When I was still working on Public, I definitely noticed an uptick in signups on Public when I streamed about it. There's something about streaming on twitch. People.

03:02:30
<transcript>: they build a

03:02:31
ayoungh: Inspired

03:02:36
salman_jawed98: Is this a frontend website development stream?

03:02:37
<transcript>: They build a connection with you. They want to know the stuff you're using. So I do hope that you see more ssd signups. That be cool.

03:02:42
<transcript>: I'd feel good about my time streaming if it made more.

03:02:42
<transcript>: signup

03:02:47
salman_jawed98: I am a mobile developer

03:02:48
<transcript>: Signup for SSD. You should all sign up. Go, everybody go. Sign up for restless. See, right now I guess you can't really sign up for SSD.

03:02:52
<transcript>: Everybody go download it on mpm right now. Do it.

03:02:57
<transcript>: Is this a frontend website development stream salmon kind of.

03:02:57
<transcript>: you're a mobile develop

03:03:04
<transcript>: You're a mobile developer, so kind of I don't consider myself a friend and developer, but I do work on it a lot.

03:03:04
<transcript>: so we do

03:03:06
premjyotish221: I've thought about streaming in the past but scared I would accidentally leak something lol

03:03:11
uberrick: "Full stack" :D

03:03:12
thdxr: everyone run a while true loop that npm i sst so we can show growth numbers for VCs

03:03:13
<transcript>: So we do everything here. I do a lot of aws stuff back in stuff I do we'll do some mobile development when I work on rebates rebase TV.

03:03:18
<transcript>: Thought about streaming in the past, but scared I would accidentally leak something.

03:03:18
<transcript>: oh

03:03:18
salman_jawed98: Awesomeee

03:03:23
<transcript>: Oh, welcome to Chat prim. You leak stuff every single time you stream it's just part of it.

03:03:31
thdxr: adam leaked his wife the other day

03:03:32
thdxr: WIFE LEAK

03:03:34
<transcript>: I don't know. It could be really bad. I guess. I've heard prime leaked his credit card one time. That sucks. But, yeah, it's just kind of thing you deal with. You have to rotate secrets a lot. What.

03:03:34
<transcript>: everyone

03:03:37
<transcript>: Everyone run a while true loop that npm.

03:03:37
<transcript>: installs

03:03:40
<transcript>: Installs ssd so you can show gross numbers for me.

03:03:41
devagrawal09: trash leaked his address

03:03:42
uberrick: Can't wait to spent $6k on slack notifications @thdxr :p

03:03:44
<transcript>: Wife leak. I did leak my wife on accident.

03:03:44
<transcript>: trash

03:03:47
<transcript>: Trash leaks is addressed. Ooh.

03:03:47
<transcript>: can't wait

03:03:47
laytanl_: primeagenHeyy

03:03:50
<transcript>: Can't wait to send $6,000 on Slightly notifications.

03:03:59
<transcript>: Okay, I should get back to focusing. Focusing on tabs. So how do I do this? I bet there's something in the astronauts that'll help me.

03:04:03
uberrick: spend even

03:04:03
<transcript>: This is a pattern that I never know how it works.

03:04:13
<transcript>: I know that this is a pattern people do, like in react. I've done it before even. But I don't know what's called, like when you want to know something about the children.

03:04:13
<transcript>: like

03:04:17
<transcript>: Like you want to rent, you want to have a component called tab.

03:04:30
devagrawal09: render props

03:04:34
<transcript>: And a tabs component should always take in tab children and then you want to be able to interact with those tab children, but they're dynamic. What is that like pattern called how can I find help for doing that in astro prim? Thanks so much for the follow.

03:04:34
<transcript>: render

03:04:36
devagrawal09: maybe?

03:04:39
<transcript>: Render props. That's what it's called dev. Render props.

03:04:39
<transcript>: maybe

03:04:41
thdxr: it's called the Child Abuse pattern

03:04:42
<transcript>: Maybe render props.

03:04:42
<transcript>: i mean i know you

03:04:44
<transcript>: I mean, I know you didn't mean like.

03:04:44
<transcript>: literally

03:04:46
tqwewe: Or you can use context in react

03:04:51
<transcript>: Literally type that into the search, but I'm just trying. It's called the child abuse pattern. Stop it. Next.

03:04:53
salman_jawed98: Tab Groups

03:04:53
uberrick: @thdxr LUL

03:04:58
<transcript>: Context and react. I never use contaction. React. I don't like it. I don't really know if I'm wrong, but I don't like it.

03:05:00
<transcript>: Tab groups.

03:05:01
premjyotish221: The recent Twitter algorithm has been pushing your account, noticed the sign in the back instantly, looks great

03:05:20
<transcript>: So I could have two separate components. One is a tab component. One is a tabs component, but they're gonna have to interact with each other, or they're gonna have to be in a certain structure in the dom. Like the tab itself here has to have peer checked block. I guess that doesn't. I guess it could still have that class, and it wouldn't matter.

03:05:20
<transcript>: well no no

03:05:23
<transcript>: Well, no, no, wait.

03:05:29
<transcript>: So this is a tab. Okay. I'm think I have a tab's component.

03:05:29
<transcript>: because all the ta

03:05:36
<transcript>: Because all the tabs is is this outer div, and it just has very little styling as a flex filing. But is that even right.

03:05:42
<transcript>: Maybe I don't even have a tabs component. Maybe I just have a tab component.

03:05:45
<transcript>: I think I just have a tab component. Never mind.

03:05:46
<transcript>: Remind.

03:05:46
<transcript>: i still want to know

03:05:52
<transcript>: I still want to know what that pattern is called, but I think in this case I just have tab.

03:05:54
<transcript>: I think.

03:05:57
<transcript>: So.

03:05:57
<transcript>: let's go

03:06:00
<transcript>: Let's go back here. Did I delete all that no good.

03:06:02
<transcript>: Good. Okay.

03:06:02
<transcript>: back over here

03:06:06
<transcript>: Back over here. Let's our Tab component now.

03:06:06
<transcript>: is

03:06:09
<transcript>: Is just this thing.

03:06:11
<transcript>: Right.

03:06:22
<transcript>: And this is gonna be the slot. So everything inside of this Div.

03:06:24
<transcript>: Right.

03:06:26
<transcript>: It's a slot.

03:06:29
<transcript>: And we have the hidden peer check block.

03:06:29
<transcript>: we

03:06:31
<transcript>: We have a layer.

03:06:37
<transcript>: Tab one so these are gonna have to be dynamic somehow. The IDs.

03:06:37
<transcript>: do i just

03:06:43
<transcript>: Do I just serve or render an ID. So I just do the crypto thing. Import crypto from.

03:06:43
<transcript>: no

03:06:46
<transcript>: Node, crypto node, crypto.

03:06:49
<transcript>: Is that it.

03:06:54
<transcript>: Wrong. Fi. What is it? Crypto.

03:06:54
tqwewe: The pattern is called Compound Components btw (thanks ChatGPT)

03:06:56
<transcript>: What visit.

03:06:57
thdxr: ugh great adam is becoming  a cryptobro

03:07:08
<transcript>: Is becoming a crypto. Bro pattern is called compound components. Oh, interesting. Thank you.

03:07:08
<transcript>: thanks chai

03:07:08
premjyotish221: should just be 'crypto'

03:07:10
<transcript>: Thanks chai dbt and thank you tq.

03:07:10
<transcript>: the recent twitter

03:07:14
premjyotish221: You might need node types

03:07:15
<transcript>: The recent Twitter algorithm has been pushing your account. Notice the sign in the back instantly looks great.

03:07:15
<transcript>: oh really

03:07:18
<transcript>: Oh, really? Twitter's on my side. Okay.

03:07:18
<transcript>: alright

03:07:20
<transcript>: Alright.

03:07:20
<transcript>: should it be

03:07:20
studiojvla: Big fan of compound components

03:07:22
<transcript>: Should it be crypto.

03:07:22
<transcript>: crypt

03:07:23
<transcript>: Crypto.

03:07:27
pudottapommin: for crypto I had to use "self.crypto.randomUUID()"

03:07:30
<transcript>: Kind of crypto. I wonder if node types is not by default in Astro.

03:07:30
<transcript>: do i need

03:07:35
<transcript>: Do I need crypto? Can I just create a uid some other way.

03:07:40
studiojvla: Been writing some stuff about the relationship between components being codified is as important as the components themselves

03:07:44
<transcript>: Did you self crypto random uuid welcome to Chat. Poodota. Is that in an Astro project.

03:07:47
<transcript>: Studio is a big fan of compound components.

03:07:54
<transcript>: Don't just need to add node types or is there a better way to make a uuid. I just need a uuid.

03:07:57
meranofox: crypto is not available in the browser though

03:08:00
<transcript>: Instant.

03:08:03
meranofox: not sure how Astro works

03:08:08
pudottapommin: It was in sveltekit and vite

03:08:10
<transcript>: Crypto's not available in the browser. It'll be serverside. Merino. Yeah, it'll all just be serverside. So I think I can just let's just do this node.

03:08:10
<transcript>: astro

03:08:10
thdxr: crypto.randomUUID()

03:08:14
<transcript>: Astro node I need to add astro js node.

03:08:22
<transcript>: Saver out of the box. You don't need an adapter. Oh, yeah, we already use this adapter. It's ss T. So what about types.

03:08:28
<transcript>: Node.

03:08:32
<transcript>: Astro.

03:08:35
<transcript>: Node types.

03:08:38
<transcript>: Just I want to add it if it's not how I should do it.

03:08:38
<transcript>: supports no

03:08:43
<transcript>: Supports no disk builtins using nodes newer node prefix. That's what I thought.

03:08:49
<transcript>: I thought this already. Let's see. We encourage azure users to avoid nodejs builtins.

03:08:49
<transcript>: asher

03:08:55
<transcript>: Asher aims to be compatible with multiple javascript runtimes in the future. This includes denno CloudFare workers.

03:08:55
<transcript>: you know what i could

03:09:00
studiojvla: We've built these 'patterns' in our design system team that have allowed us to scratch up a new view in like... less than 5 minutes. Pretty sweet.

03:09:02
<transcript>: You know what I could do? I could if I'm gonna do this, I could just do I could just add the npm uuid. Let's just see that.

03:09:06
<transcript>: Wait, what are you saying? Dax. Crypto. Random. Uni.

03:09:10
studiojvla: And they're all consistent all the time

03:09:14
thdxr: idk what I'm saying ignore me

03:09:16
<transcript>: Like is it better to use a nodespecific thing or should I just add an npm thing.

03:09:20
<transcript>: Add an npm thing you don't know you're saying ignore me, okay.

03:09:22
thdxr: I'm pretty sure I used crypto in astro

03:09:22
<transcript>: I'm just gonna do this.

03:09:27
premjyotish221: Node specific likely better since more optimized / stable

03:09:28
studiojvla: Even patterns for complex filtering / sort / with a paginated table etc

03:09:31
<transcript>: Is it PM? P. M. I don't remember.

03:09:49
<transcript>: Okay.

03:09:49

03:11:01
<transcript>: Ew. I'm pretty sure I use crypto and astro. Dax, really.

03:11:11
<transcript>: Nano ID. You have video footage of yourself using crypto and asher. Are you kidding me? Did I see it error. And then the video cuts. It's not erroring.

03:11:19
<transcript>: Dax is thinking funny on Twitter. Again? What you made funny on Twitter? Oh, boy, here we go.

<transcript>: Crypto. Like Why does that not work.

03:12:05
<transcript>: Like this is a problem.

03:12:13
<transcript>: With my lsp or something typescript? Can I find module node, crypto wordsigning, type, decorations.

03:12:26
<transcript>: Do I just need to add node types? Maybe I just need to add node types, not fan. Likely because type script doesn't ship node type city file. You're right. You're right. So let's do this. Let's do pmpm remove.

03:12:26
<transcript>: i

03:12:31
<transcript>: I like this better. Let's remove you a little. We're using nodes that doesn't matter.

03:12:37

03:12:37
<transcript>: files

03:12:40

03:19:23
<transcript>: So I can just refresh the page and it should be checked. Okay, I'll follow, then. Welcome to Chat. Read a boy.

03:19:33

<transcript>: Playerstass needs to be converted into a tab.

03:19:56
redaboi: I m new here what are you using for front end

03:19:56
<transcript>: So tab label.

03:19:56

<transcript>: Equals Players tab.

03:20:01
<transcript>: This one is not checked.

03:20:07
<transcript>: And the contents of this one are empty. So I'm just gonna delete that.

03:20:07
<transcript>: and then

03:20:10
<transcript>: And then we're just gonna go ahead and hide this thing. We'll figure out.

03:20:17
<transcript>: We'll figure out how to maintain that selection style.

<transcript>: Now it's astro. So we're writing the frontend.

03:21:00
<transcript>: In Astro.

03:21:08
<transcript>: Or the backend. I don't know. We're riding all of it in astro. The whole thing is astro, because it kind of is your whole thing.

03:21:08
<transcript>: and then

03:21:20
<transcript>: And then right now we have no front and anything. No interactivity yet 140 supervisors forcing you to write code. Exactly. You guys are terrible at your job break. No one has forced me to ride enough code today.

03:21:25
<transcript>: Read an rewriting statmes.com with astro and SST.

03:21:28
<transcript>: That is what we are doing.

03:22:39
<transcript>: shout out

03:22:41
scadoooby: Hey I'm an Adam and a developer lol.

03:22:43
<transcript>: Shout out to stannis and eli for.

03:22:43
<transcript>: making

03:22:47
guy_from_mars: Good for you!

03:22:47

03:22:51
<transcript>: A shanti Linux.

03:22:54

03:22:59
<transcript>: i think

03:23:00
daglee: Own all the adam domains! \o/

03:23:06
<transcript>: I think I said a few other ones. I don't remember. Do you use ssr shg for the Astrobuild? It's Ssrmid core.

03:23:06
<transcript>: so it's ss

03:23:14
<transcript>: So it's ssr. We're gonna put it behind some SWR headers. So stalewire revalitate. We get kind of that next Jsisr functionality, which.

03:23:14
<transcript>: it always

03:23:14
kryotoboi: oh now I know, I was meant to go watch the other adamdotdev streams NotLikeThis

03:23:16
vapor__dev: tsll

03:23:25
thdxr: swr is never coming out

03:23:26
<transcript>: It always searching the cdn, but asynchronously regenerates the thing like hit your origin in the background. So that's how we're gonna we're gonna leverage some new features coming to cloud front. A tobs cloud front.

03:23:26
<transcript>: that

03:23:32
<transcript>: That will allow us to get sort of like Nick shisr functionality, but it is SSR.

03:23:39
<transcript>: Want to buy Dot debt. I want to buy dev dev once I become millionaire. Is that one available.

03:23:39
<transcript>: it dev

03:23:40
<transcript>: It Dev.

03:23:48
<transcript>: Dev. It's already taken. Dev. Oh, you mean by it from the person? I guess they're always available. If you just buy it from somebody, what is that.

03:23:53
<transcript>: Like Adam, dev was not available in a traditional sense.

03:24:00
devagrawal09: there's nothing there

03:24:00
<transcript>: They're not using it. That's a good sign. Adam dev. He was using it. He actually had something on it.

03:24:00
<transcript>: so

03:24:01
fitzsimons_dev: since my name is dev I should prob get dev.dev

03:24:04
<transcript>: So your price might be lower? Dev Dev.

03:24:10
daglee: dev.dev.dev ?

03:24:10
fitzsimons_dev: i'll just empty all my retirement accounts

03:24:14
<transcript>: That would be a really good one. First time chat. Welcome to chess God dubi. Hey, I'm an Adam and a developer. Hey, Skidoobie, you're not the atom Dev that I bought the domain from, are you.

03:24:18
<transcript>: There's a few Adam devs there's Adam wagon WAZEN.

03:24:18
<transcript>: there's

03:24:24
<transcript>: There's atom ruck Raccus racquet ruckus Works at Spotify.

03:24:27
<transcript>: Wasn't it? 50k cafes? No.

03:24:27
<transcript>: you're

03:24:34
<transcript>: You're getting closer. But it was more than that. Even maybe your wife does like me. Maybe she does.

03:24:47
daglee: If you get dev.dev.dev.dev.dev.dev.dev.dev.dev.dev then you are a 10x developer?

03:24:49
redaboi: what do you think about Django

03:24:49
<transcript>: Dm. Mullroy thanks so shy. I follow own all the atom domains I've thought about. Okay now I don't want to talk about it because everyone's gonna go out there and buy them and then like expect me to buy them from them. I'm not buying any more Adam domains, but if I did, I would go through and find all the available ones and buy them.

03:24:52
schweiber: Is Astro really fast? I’m planning to switch my personal website from nextjs to alpinejs. Should I consider astro too?

03:24:54
devagrawal09: @daglee yep

03:24:55
<transcript>: Now I know I was meant to go watch the other Adam dev streams.

03:25:00
<transcript>: Swear is never coming out. It's coming next, it's coming, it's coming.

03:25:00
<transcript>: since

03:25:05
<transcript>: Since my name is dev, I should probably get dev, dev, we got competition.

03:25:05
<transcript>: right here

03:25:09
<transcript>: Right here in my Twitch chat over Dev, Dev.

03:25:14

03:25:20
<transcript>: Polyglots. I like that name, Pollygloth. I'll just empty all my retirement houses.

03:25:26
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Nesneca, who used Adam TV before it redirected to some Canadian something.

03:25:26
<transcript>: it redire

03:25:30
paulyglots: Yw mate.

03:25:30
<transcript>: It redirected something. They just were holding it to sell it, I guess.

03:25:33
rudixworld: I just realized there is no domain.www Kappa imagine the fun having such

03:25:33
<transcript>: They were just taking advantage of the system.

03:25:33
<transcript>: but welcome

03:25:37
mattmancodes: A moose?

03:25:38
<transcript>: But welcome to my Chat nes. That one was a tough one to negotiate, because.

03:25:40
<transcript>: There was some.

03:25:40
<transcript>: communic

03:25:44
devagrawal09: even if i got dev.dev, my greatest achievement will still be ass dot cleaning

03:25:48
paulyglots: Front ending it today?

03:25:51
<transcript>: Communication barriers. And I was pretty sure we had agreed on a price that he then later was like, I didn't agree to that price. I don't know what to talk about. It actually cost twice that much.

03:25:55
<transcript>: Because I literally okay.

03:25:55
<transcript>: storytime

03:25:58
<transcript>: Storytime. I'll just come over here actually.

03:26:04
<transcript>: I also gotta catch up on chat if you get Dev.

03:26:12
<transcript>: Then you are a ten X developer. That's funny. So negotiation for Adam TV, I. Tweeted.

03:26:15
schweiber: What code editor are you using?

03:26:23
<transcript>: Six months ago, something like that. I said, if someone would buy Adam TV for me for $100,000, because that's what the original price you had told me was if someone would buy it for me for $100,000.

03:26:33
<transcript>: And let me stream my work on day. I would consider a fulltime job because before that I'd always sort of said, like I'm unhireable, like, there's no way I would ever go back to a fulltime job. I love my like independent life, too much.

03:26:38
<transcript>: But I? Tweeted that out and my cofounder reached out to me I've been gone from setmes for three years.

03:26:38
<transcript>: we had

03:26:50
<transcript>: We had kind of a falling out, my cofounder and I and but we had been talking. We had been on good terms. And he reached out and was like, hey, what if we did that? What if what if I hit your bid? And I was like.

03:26:50
<transcript>: i

03:26:57
rudixworld: how much the neon sign cost you ?

03:27:01
<transcript>: I didn't expect anyone to actually take that seriously, but I was kind of like, it'd be cool to go back to that. And he's work on this stuff again with people I love at sat mews. So I was like an attractive thing. And it was like.

03:27:01
<transcript>: maybe

03:27:05
mattmancodes: @schweiber Neovim

03:27:08
<transcript>: Maybe the domain. Maybe that's too bad. Maybe that's a little extravagant. Maybe we shouldn't do it, but he's like, no, we'll do it. And I was like, okay.

03:27:08
<transcript>: so then

03:27:11
<transcript>: So then the guy tried to, like, rake us over the coals.

03:27:14
stroopwafel26: So you have a job now?

03:27:15
<transcript>: But it all worked out in the end.

03:27:20
vapor__dev: hid da bid, off 100 for adam.dev, 100 for adam.dev, fill or kill!

03:27:21
<transcript>: What do you think about django? I don't really think anything about django. I did work in a python show.

03:27:21
<transcript>: for

03:27:23
<transcript>: For a year.

03:27:23
<transcript>: and

03:27:24
nezznaika: wow that crazy af story)

03:27:40
<transcript>: And they use a lot of django. I didn't use a lot of django, but they use a lot of django. I mostly did other stuff elsewhere in the sack. Firsttime chat. Welcome to Chat schweber is actually really fast. I'm planning to switch my personal website from next shift to alpine js. Should I consider astro Two I think I showed is fantastic for personal sites.

03:27:41
uberrick: crazy that the domain owner of adam.tv got to sell it for that much :D

03:27:46
<transcript>: Basically anytime. It's just like an information site, like a brochure side or whatever.

03:27:55
fitzsimons_dev: So is part of your streaming a plan to get devs interested in working at Statmuse? Is that a part of the point?

03:27:56
<transcript>: I think those are really well suited for astro. It is really fast. I mean it's just like right some typescript to render your page. It's like PHP.

03:28:02
devagrawal09: how do i find out who owns a domain

03:28:02
thdxr: thdxr

03:28:09
thdxr: thdxr.tv costs $20

03:28:16
<transcript>: And yeah, I would consider it. It's got really great stuff. If you want to like do your own blog and not use some cms. It's got really great stuff around markdown files. So it'd be actually it'd be a great framework for building like a good personal site and a good personal blog because of all the content collection stuff like markdown support that they have.

03:28:16
<transcript>: okay

03:28:17
<transcript>: Okay.

03:28:17
<transcript>: ad

03:28:19
schweiber: @mattmancodes is vim easy to setup? I don’t have any idea on how to use vim lol

03:28:22
<transcript>: Adam would be cool? That would be cool? Is that A M A tld.

03:28:22
<transcript>: i don't actually know

03:28:26
<transcript>: I don't actually know polyglots. You're welcome. Welcome to Chat. Poly.

03:28:31
uberrick: @thdxr haha not anymore just bought it $50k to you

03:28:32
<transcript>: Just realize there's no domain www. That one's mine.

03:28:32
<transcript>: mess wrapper

03:28:35
<transcript>: Mess wrapper. Imagine the fun having such.

03:28:35
uberrick: xD

03:28:49
<transcript>: A moose? What is a moose? Even if I got dev, dev, my greatest achievement will still be assot cleaning. That was you, dev. I saw the like theo gifting it to.

03:28:49
<transcript>: gifting

03:28:50
vapor__dev: vaporrub.dev is 12/year

03:28:55
<transcript>: Gifting it to leadwig? But you gifted it to theo. To gift to ludwig. That's awesome.

03:28:58

03:29:00
<transcript>: Unfortunately, Polly.

03:29:00

03:29:02
<transcript>: What code editor? It's neovem.

03:29:05
devagrawal09: i didn't gift him, i gave theo that idea

03:29:07
<transcript>: The neon sign reader decks. I think it's just like a $100 or $200 or something like that.

03:29:07
<transcript>: my wife

03:29:10
<transcript>: My wife got it from my birthday. Maybe.

03:29:10
<transcript>: not so

03:29:13
thdxr: I'm in the shower rn is that tmi

03:29:14
<transcript>: Not so everything you see in my life. My wife got me from a birthday. She does like me.

03:29:18
devagrawal09: @thdxr yes

03:29:19
<transcript>: So I have a job. Now. I do stroop. I work back at stat. Mews.

03:29:24
<transcript>: Okay.

03:29:26
dmmulroy: Did you have to do anything config wise w/ neovim to have a mix of italics + regular font?

03:29:29
mattmancodes: @schweiber not really, it becomes a lifestyle choice

03:29:29
<transcript>: Crazy that the domain owner of Amazon TV got to sell it for that much. Yeah.

03:29:29
<transcript>: i know

03:29:31
<transcript>: I know.

03:29:31
<transcript>: so

03:29:41
uberrick: @thdxr waterless shower

03:29:49
stroopwafel26: @thdxr shower stream?

03:29:51
<transcript>: So as part of your streaming, a plan to get destined to working at statues, is that a part of the point? So if it's them and there's a lot of points to me streaming, I just really enjoy it. That's the main point. Like I have a lot of fun hanging out with people. I've spent 15 years as a programmer, just working in my office alone. I've always worked from home, so I've never had coworkers.

03:29:51
<transcript>: and people i get

03:29:56
<transcript>: And people I get to hang out with. So the number one reason I stream is it's like getting a half coworker.

03:29:56
<transcript>: that

03:29:58
<transcript>: That are really distracting.

03:30:06
<transcript>: I mean, like, it's my own fault. I'm distracted very easily, but it's like 15 years of pinned up, not being distracted.

03:30:12
<transcript>: I just want to be distracted because it's like, oh, there's other people that, like the things I like, so that's the main reason.

03:30:12
<transcript>: and

03:30:13
dmmulroy: @schweiber Here's my config in lua if you wanna take a look, I've tried to comment most things: https://github.com/dmmulroy/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/nvim

03:30:20
<transcript>: And then there's side benefits to streaming. It's like, yeah, it gets some exposure to that means we're gonna do a lot of open source stuff in the Latin the next year.

03:30:20
<transcript>: and so

03:30:22
devagrawal09: shower stream and put it in the hot tub category

03:30:26
<transcript>: And so if there's people who are really into what we're doing at that muse, and I discover them by streaming on twitch. That's a great side effect.

03:30:26
<transcript>: tx

03:30:31
<transcript>: Tx th dxr TV Costs $20. I hate you, DAX.

03:30:31
<transcript>: how

03:30:31
redaboi: So now I am a distraction PepeLaugh

03:30:36
<transcript>: How do I find out who owns the domain? So in the case of Annabout TV.

03:30:40
<transcript>: I think I use something. What is it called? Domain.

03:30:40
<transcript>: it

03:30:55
<transcript>: It's like a it was like an escrow service that they reach out to them for you. That's how I made initial contact. Then I just found their contact information on the site that they had set up that Adam TV was redacting to. So this is just kind of like there's a few different ways.

03:30:55
<transcript>: it's a hit or miss

03:30:57
<transcript>: It's a hit or miss.

03:31:03
<transcript>: Sometimes I can't find who I owns a domain, and that's a bummer. Okay, let's get back to it.

03:31:12
laytanl_: Have fun in the shower

03:31:20
<transcript>: I'm still reading. I'm in the shower right now. Is that too much? You're not in the shower. Welcome to Chat dm. Moleroid. Did you have to do anything configwise with ne of them to have a mix of italics plus regular font? Great question. Yes.

03:31:24
<transcript>: And not just that made me realize hang on.

03:31:24
<transcript>: did i break that

03:31:24
redaboi: I am independent too , and I come to twitch to distract myself , cause I have a bug and I don't want to fix it KEKW

03:31:27
<transcript>: Did I break that? No, no, I got it. Still working.

03:31:27
<transcript>: i did

03:31:30
<transcript>: I did so it's in here somewhere.

03:31:33
<transcript>: And I can find it really fast.

03:31:34
<transcript>: It's.

03:31:40
<transcript>: Right here. My tree. Seeter config. This is how I highlight.

03:31:44
<transcript>: Certain things. I put them in italics using.

03:31:44
<transcript>: this

03:31:47
dmmulroy: Are your dotfiles public?

03:31:49
<transcript>: This tree. Sitter contact. No using this whatever this is.

03:31:54
<transcript>: That's most of my neo vm configuration is like, oh, whatever this stuff is.

03:31:54
<transcript>: this

03:31:56
kryotoboi: I just found out .ninja domains exist

03:31:57
laytanl_: !dotfiles

03:31:57
fossabot: Adam's dotfiles live here: https://github.com/adamelmore/dotfiles

03:31:57
stroopwafel26: !dotfiles

03:31:57
fossabot: Adam's dotfiles live here: https://github.com/adamelmore/dotfiles

03:32:00
<transcript>: This makes those things constantly. Words and comments are in italics. That's how I did it.

03:32:03
stroopwafel26: hey @laytanl_

03:32:04
dmmulroy: thanks y'all!

03:32:07
<transcript>: That could make other things. I think it's enough, but I could make other things using the same message. That's how it works.

03:32:07
<transcript>: update hl

03:32:09
<transcript>: Update? Hl. What's it doing.

03:32:09
<transcript>: get highlight

03:32:11
laytanl_: HeyGuys

03:32:13
redaboi: kkkkkkkkkkkk shift jjjjjjjjjjjjj , vim is cool

03:32:19
<transcript>: Okay, okay, let's get back to this. So player stats. Player stats is a.

03:32:19
<transcript>: tab now

03:32:20
<transcript>: Tab. Now.

03:32:27
<transcript>: And now we need to figure out why is that background? The background should not be colored like the tab header.

03:32:29
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:32:34
<transcript>: Let's see, let's see.

03:32:40
<transcript>: Yeah, diamora. My dot follows Republic. Sorry you saw that shower. Stream.

03:32:41
clutch4t: Is the X in header input supposed to be offset like that? LUL I keep on looking at it and wondering if it is intentional

03:32:50
<transcript>: I'm just make sure I didn't miss anybody coming in. Just chat for first time. And I did clutch 14. Welcome to chat.

03:32:50
<transcript>: is

03:32:58
<transcript>: Is the X in header input supposed to be offset like that? I keep on looking at it and wondering if it is intentional X in the header input.

03:32:58
<transcript>: is

03:33:02
<transcript>: Is the X in header input.

03:33:05
stroopwafel26: the search field @adamdotdev

03:33:13
<transcript>: Oh yeah. Ignore all of this up at the top. I have not done any. It's just like a big blob of html I copied from the site just to have something up there. But yeah, it's all bad. Just ignore it.

03:33:20
<transcript>: The real one looks like this, I guess. And when you start typing, you have an X. So there's normally an icon. There.

03:33:20
<transcript>: yeah just

03:33:24
<transcript>: Yeah, just ignore everything up at the top. It's iron done. It.

03:33:24
<transcript>: okay

03:33:26
clutch4t: oh, I see

03:33:29
<transcript>: Okay. Thanks, troop. Let's do this. Let's make the tab itself.

03:33:32
<transcript>: Tab, Astro.

03:33:35
mattmancodes: That'll be fixed in 400 larabars time

03:33:35
stroopwafel26: welcome, adam

03:33:35
<transcript>: They need some water.

03:33:47
<transcript>: Thank you for the follows stoveack, cat, burial, Schweber and skidubi. I think I already said scooby, but I want to say it again.

03:33:48
stroopwafel26: larabar time!

03:33:51
<transcript>: And I'm fixed in 400 larab our side.

03:34:00
<transcript>: That's so funny. Okay. So the background right now is right here. And we want it to be not right there. We want this background.

03:34:06
<transcript>: Or I'm maybe I can just do it like this background. White.

03:34:06
<transcript>: and then

03:34:09
<transcript>: And then I can just put that back up here.

03:34:15
<transcript>: Like this.

03:34:15
<transcript>: does that

03:34:16
<transcript>: Does that work.

03:34:20
<transcript>: No, it looks awful.

03:34:22
<transcript>: So, so awful.

03:34:22
<transcript>: what's going

03:34:24
<transcript>: What's going on.

03:34:32
<transcript>: Can I put a class on the slot.

03:34:32
<transcript>: i can

03:34:33
katburial: Solid stream music. Always a good sign.

03:34:33
<transcript>: I can.

03:34:38
<transcript>: I don't know if that's gonna help. Probably not.

03:34:42
<transcript>: It also doesn't work.

03:34:48
<transcript>: So.

03:34:57
<transcript>: I need like a thing I can style. That's just the top. Like what's? This thing? This is hidden. The label is just text.

03:34:57
<transcript>: it's like i

03:35:00
<transcript>: It's like I need to change, okay? I need to change some things. We need another Div.

03:35:04
stroopwafel26: it used to be 99% alt-j

03:35:07
<transcript>: Oh, but then it won't be appear well, it if I put these in this Div will it be appear.

03:35:19
<transcript>: So if we theoretically we said text, center, text, white, bg, primary.

03:35:19
<transcript>: two by

03:35:21
<transcript>: Two by three, cursor.

03:35:21
<transcript>: cleaner

03:35:26
<transcript>: Cleaner and font semi Bold if I did all that.

03:35:30
<transcript>: Like this.

03:35:34
<transcript>: What would that do.

03:35:38
<transcript>: I would break everything.

03:35:38
<transcript>: literally

03:35:45
<transcript>: Literally everything okay? Good to know. Oh, well, this one can go back out here, right.

03:35:49
<transcript>: That one can go back up there.

03:35:54
<transcript>: Okay. This is getting better right now. We have it like this.

03:35:54
<transcript>: that just seems

03:35:55
bebenzer: do you have some lags with tailwind lsp? I often have my vim being blocked for a few ms waiting for tailwind suggestion

03:36:01
<transcript>: That just seems to have full width. Why is that? Yeah. Why is that like that? Is it flex? Do I have it flexed somewhere.

03:36:01
mecoupz: you have cursor-auto instead of cursor-pointer and font-sans instead of font-semibold

03:36:05
<transcript>: Flex one? Why is that flex one.

03:36:09
<transcript>: I don't know what that means. Okay, that should be flexed. One.

03:36:14
<transcript>: Absolute. Okay. So this.

03:36:19
<transcript>: Hidden Pucheck block Background white.

03:36:19
<transcript>: cat

03:36:26
<transcript>: Cat Burial welcome to Chat. Solid Stream Music Hey, I appreciate that always a good sign. Used to be 99% all day. That's true.

03:36:26
<transcript>: we've changed

03:36:46
<transcript>: We've changed that. Do you have some lags with tailwind? Lsp. I often have my zim being blocked for a few milliseconds waiting for tail and suggestion. I don't really know this. I've got a pretty beefy machine and I feel like I don't notice a lot of the lag. People like people say vs code is slow. I don't know. It's always pretty sad for me, but I also use like an M one Max with like a ton of Ram.

03:36:46
<transcript>: this is

03:36:48
<transcript>: This is very fast.

03:36:48
<transcript>: app

03:36:58
<transcript>: Apple Studio. So maybe I just don't know this lag, you have a cursor auto instead of cursor pointer and font stands instead of font semi bolt. Oh, why is that.

03:36:58
<transcript>: i

03:37:00
<transcript>: I just accept it.

03:37:00
<transcript>: thank

03:37:02
stroopwafel26: M1 Max Mac

03:37:03
<transcript>: Thank you so much. Where would we be without.

03:37:03
<transcript>: chat here

03:37:05
<transcript>: Chat here, cursor.

03:37:05
<transcript>: pointer

03:37:09
laytanl_: I have slowdowns with tailwind lsp too

03:37:10
<transcript>: Pointer. I just accepted a suggestion or something, and that just whatever.

03:37:10
<transcript>: and then this

03:37:14
laytanl_: It's just slow

03:37:17
<transcript>: And then this should be fought. Semi bold. I'm funny. I'm not funny. I do funny things. Okay.

03:37:20
<transcript>: There's our label. I.

03:37:26
<transcript>: This isn't full width.

03:37:26
<transcript>: let's

03:37:30
<transcript>: Let's look in the slot here.

03:37:32
<transcript>: What did I just do.

03:37:32
<transcript>: so

03:37:35
<transcript>: So here we have class flex on that thing.

03:37:40
<transcript>: So this is in a div. Does it need to be in a div? Maybe not.

03:37:44
<transcript>: Maybe maybe we can just delete the outer Div.

03:37:52
<transcript>: Up so I like it.

03:37:54
<transcript>: So.

03:37:54
<transcript>: this

03:37:55
<transcript>: This one.

03:38:00
<transcript>: Like, I need this one. This flex.

03:38:05
<transcript>: I know what to do I know what to do people. I got this.

03:38:08
<transcript>: Slot so down here.

03:38:08
bebenzer: @laytanl_ : (

03:38:10
<transcript>: Let's do.

03:38:12
<transcript>: This with full.

03:38:15
<transcript>: Need to do that.

03:38:16
mecoupz: i dont see slowdowns with vscode on my m2 air but havent tried with vim and lsp

03:38:18
<transcript>: Is it the Adder thing is flex one.

03:38:21
<transcript>: Inspects time.

03:38:23
<transcript>: Inspect.

03:38:25
<transcript>: inspection

03:38:26
<transcript>: Inspection.

03:38:28
katburial: We’ve all been there, @stroopwafel26. Well, for me it was Portugal. The Man, but apples/oranges.

03:38:30
<transcript>: So this is the.

03:38:33
<transcript>: Hidden here's our.

03:38:33
<transcript>: content thing

03:38:35
<transcript>: Content thing.

03:38:38
<transcript>: Oh.

03:38:40
<transcript>: Yeah, I see.

03:38:40
<transcript>: because

03:38:47
<transcript>: Because I have all the the stuff is nested within the ooh. How do I get around that.

03:38:50
<transcript>: That's why they absolutely positioned it.

03:38:54
<transcript>: So that you could take up the full width of this.

03:38:54
<transcript>: okay can i get

03:38:57
<transcript>: Okay. Can I get around that? Can I get around that.

03:38:57
<transcript>: so let's

03:38:59
<transcript>: So let's remove that.

03:39:09
<transcript>: So I want this content thing to be like an absolute maybe.

03:39:09
<transcript>: and then

03:39:12
<transcript>: And then we need to have relative on the.

03:39:16
<transcript>: App will say absolute.

03:39:19
<transcript>: Inset. Zero, I guess.

03:39:22
<transcript>: And then back here.

03:39:24
<transcript>: Where we actually.

03:39:24
<transcript>: call it

03:39:25
<transcript>: Call it.

03:39:33
<transcript>: I guess I have to do relative on the tab itself.

03:39:36
jiggaman98: You're a tall glass of water aren't yuhhhhhh?

03:39:38
<transcript>: What do I need.

03:39:44
<transcript>: What am I talking about.

03:39:46
mecoupz: relative on the div with flex-1

03:39:49
<transcript>: Yeah. This should be right here. Right.

03:39:56
<transcript>: Maybe I don't actually know this is hurting my brain. If it's there, then I could have just put it.

03:40:00
<transcript>: I could just put it in the Tab control.

03:40:00
<transcript>: not

03:40:04
<transcript>: Not there. I guess this thing needs to be relative.

03:40:09
<transcript>: Sink. I don't know.

03:40:09
<transcript>: whoa

03:40:17
<transcript>: Whoa relative on the Div with flex. One is what it is, but that's that's the problem is that's the.

03:40:17
<transcript>: wow

03:40:19
<transcript>: Wow, what just happened.

03:40:21
<transcript>: So.

03:40:21
<transcript>: let's just

03:40:25
<transcript>: Let's just do that if I if I play that out.

03:40:27
caryyon: position absolute happened

03:40:34
<transcript>: If I play that out and I go back to tab here. So if I put rich here.

03:40:34
<transcript>: then

03:40:37
<transcript>: Then it's still gonna be bound.

03:40:37
<transcript>: to the

03:40:41
<transcript>: To the size like this isn't gonna get me anything.

03:40:41
<transcript>: right

03:40:45
caryyon: which removes it from rendering in that slot and pushing your other content down

03:40:45
<transcript>: Right. It's still gonna now be bound to the size of the width of this thing.

03:40:45
<transcript>: so okay

03:40:48
<transcript>: So. Okay. Think about this.

03:40:48
<transcript>: lead

03:40:51
<transcript>: Lead to H up here.

03:40:58
<transcript>: So I think I do need a tab control.

03:40:58
<transcript>: position

03:41:03
<transcript>: Position. Absolute. Happened. Yeah. Exactly. Carry on. Welcome to chat.

03:41:05
mecoupz: oh i see

03:41:11
<transcript>: You're a tall glass of water, aren't you? You talking about me, jigga? Am I talking about the water.

03:41:14
<transcript>: Mr Fahrenheit Things hope you'll follow.

03:41:23
<transcript>: Which removes it from rendering in that slot and pushing your other content down. Yeah. So the problem is I need this whole.

03:41:28
<transcript>: Div the outer Div. So let's look at this. Let's see if I can just do it manually.

03:41:30
<transcript>: And then figure out how to do it.

03:41:30
<transcript>: in my component

03:41:36
<transcript>: In my component structure. So this is this Div right here is just that one tab.

03:41:36
<transcript>: and then this

03:41:40
<transcript>: And then this is the whole Tab control. This is where I need.

03:41:51
<transcript>: See what I'm saying? Like these tabs need to be able to take up the whole width, but then the header needs to only.

03:41:53
<transcript>: Take up.

03:41:58
<transcript>: I don't know how to do this.

03:42:04
<transcript>: I don't know how to do this. Like if I said this was relative.

03:42:05
caryyon: grid

03:42:09
<transcript>: relatively

03:42:10
<transcript>: Relatively.

03:42:10
<transcript>: well

03:42:11
<transcript>: Well.

03:42:11
<transcript>: so

03:42:13
<transcript>: So not that.

03:42:13
<transcript>: not

03:42:18
<transcript>: Not that but this if this is absolute. Now.

03:42:22
<transcript>: I put it on there.

03:42:26
anitrogen: Adam are u a gamer

03:42:27
<transcript>: Maybe I didn't.

03:42:32
<transcript>: So this if I said this is absolute.

03:42:39
<transcript>: Now we have a problem.

03:42:45
<transcript>: But this is relative. Oh, because this doesn't have the whole height of the thing.

03:42:45
<transcript>: wait why

03:42:47
<transcript>: Wait. Why.

03:42:50
<transcript>: Hidden peer checked.

03:42:53
<transcript>: Grid. You say I should use a grid.

03:42:58
<transcript>: A nitrogen atomy? Are you a gamer now? I got really addicted to games.

03:42:58
<transcript>: in

03:43:01
<transcript>: In my younger years.

03:43:02
<transcript>: And.

03:43:02
<transcript>: i cannot

03:43:08
<transcript>: I cannot play games. I did play among us with some streamer friends. That was fun.

03:43:11
<transcript>: But mostly I stay away from games.

03:43:16
<transcript>: How do I do this? A grid. You say.

03:43:16
<transcript>: a grid

03:43:27
caryyon: yup!

03:43:28
<transcript>: A grid. So like, grid. And then there's columns for each of these. Yeah. Yeah. And then this is like grid. Column span down here. I could do that. The problem is I only have tab components right now.

03:43:31
<transcript>: Only have tab components.

03:43:36
<transcript>: So like the way I've structured my components is prohibited.

03:43:36
<transcript>: let's see

03:43:37
<transcript>: Let's see if I can figure this out.

03:43:37
<transcript>: for

03:43:40
<transcript>: For what's worth I need to know.

03:43:42
<transcript>: How this works.

03:43:46
<transcript>: I don't know why I said, for what it's worth, that's totally useless words. There.

03:43:46
<transcript>: one two three

03:43:47
<transcript>: One, two, three.

03:43:49
<transcript>: How did they do this.

03:43:49
<transcript>: well they did the

03:43:51
<transcript>: Well, they did the absolute thing.

03:43:51
<transcript>: which

03:43:58
<transcript>: Which I could do this, but the way I've structured my component is not gonna work for that. Okay, let's see if we can figure this out.

03:44:01
<transcript>: So.

03:44:01
<transcript>: let's just refresh

03:44:04
<transcript>: Let's just refresh this. So here we have.

03:44:04
<transcript>: the thing

03:44:10
<transcript>: The thing, and we need to turn it into a grid. Turn into a grid. I don't know why this is.

03:44:10
<transcript>: like

03:44:12
<transcript>: Like one. What does that do.

03:44:16
<transcript>: Okay. So that makes it full width or something.

03:44:19
<transcript>: Blacks, one.

03:44:19
<transcript>: i don't

03:44:21
<transcript>: I don't know what that means.

03:44:25
<transcript>: But let's say we made it a grid.

03:44:38
<transcript>: This is an individual tab.

03:44:48
<transcript>: Like I have to have my my markup structured this way. This needs to be a pier.

03:44:48
<transcript>: of this

03:44:51
<transcript>: Of this right.

03:44:54
<transcript>: So if I have to have my markup structure like this.

03:44:59
<transcript>: Is there a way to pull out a grid layout.

03:45:02
<transcript>: I don't think there is.

03:45:07
caryyon: yea totally

03:45:07
<transcript>: So I think the things that are at odds here are.

03:45:15
caryyon: the grid is just the layout wrapper

03:45:15
<transcript>: I think the thing is that odds are using css for my selection mechanism.

03:45:18
<transcript>: And.

03:45:24
<transcript>: Yeah. Totally. I can. Okay. So. So let's play it out. If I said this is a grid.

03:45:27
<transcript>: That's a grid calls to.

03:45:31
<transcript>: Okay. Assume I said that.

03:45:35
<transcript>: Then.

03:45:42
<transcript>: I said this doesn't have a call span, but this does.

03:45:51
<transcript>: So this has a call spin to that's not going to do anything different right now. Right.

03:45:56
<transcript>: I think I need to say, grid, grid.

03:45:57
caryyon: then your tabs are row 1 col 1 to 2

03:46:02
caryyon: or 3 sorry

03:46:02
<transcript>: That looked weird right now. But what if then we make the whole thing.

03:46:02
<transcript>: and it has a

03:46:06
<transcript>: And it has a row, one, column, one to two, or three. Sorry.

03:46:09
caryyon: then your render area

03:46:10
<transcript>: Your tabs are row One. Yeah.

03:46:14
stroopwafel26: @aNitrogen The day is see WoW on this stream is the day I'm calling the police

03:46:19
caryyon: would be row 2 1 to 3

03:46:22
<transcript>: Don't let me no playing games.

03:46:22
<transcript>: would be

03:46:26
<transcript>: Would be row two, one to three.

03:46:37
<transcript>: So first row would be the column head of the tab headers, and then second row would just be the contents right.

03:46:37
<transcript>: is that the idea

03:46:38
<transcript>: Is that the idea.

03:46:40
caryyon: yup exactly

03:46:42
tiredbeaver: the amount of tabs this man has

03:46:45
tiredbeaver: prayge

03:46:47
<transcript>: Exactly. So the problem I have manotabs. This man has.

03:46:47
<transcript>: these steps

03:46:49
<transcript>: These steps. Yeah. Don't worry about this.

03:46:56
<transcript>: So he did this grid. But then the outer part, I think is what is gonna need.

03:47:00
<transcript>: Box for Here we go.

03:47:02
<transcript>: Tab.

03:47:08
<transcript>: So this is where it gets weird, because.

03:47:08
<transcript>: i think

03:47:11
<transcript>: I think this should be the grid, right.

03:47:16
<transcript>: This should be grid. Grid calls to.

03:47:18
<transcript>: Right.

03:47:22
<transcript>: And then each tab itself.

03:47:24
<transcript>: Should have.

03:47:27
daglee: Is that many? I start to close tabs when the webbrowser uses over 10gb.

03:47:37
caryyon: how many tabs are there?

03:47:40
<transcript>: So like, this would be clap. Where would I do that? It would be this one right here. That would do.

03:47:40
<transcript>: no

03:47:41
<transcript>: No.

03:47:43
mattmancodes: 2

03:47:45
<transcript>: How many times are there's? Just two.

03:47:48
<transcript>: There's two tabs.

03:47:51
<transcript>: Right here.

03:48:00
<transcript>: So if I wrapped all this.

03:48:00
<transcript>: i

03:48:02
<transcript>: I did a div here.

03:48:08
<transcript>: Like this.

03:48:14
<transcript>: Okay. So I have this Div.

03:48:16
<transcript>: I say, class.

03:48:16
<transcript>: call sp

03:48:20
<transcript>: Call span to oops call.

03:48:20
<transcript>: span

03:48:22
<transcript>: Span two.

03:48:26
<transcript>: Okay, Call Center.

03:48:31
<transcript>: And then but the actual tab.

03:48:35
<transcript>: Does not have a call spin. I don't know.

03:48:35
<transcript>: how

03:48:44
<transcript>: How's this work? Because this is nested under this part. You know, I'm saying, like, it's all nested. That's my problem is I can't like.

03:48:47
<transcript>: Style the tower the top parts independently.

03:48:55
<transcript>: Because the content has to live inside of it. You know, I'm saying, does that make sense.

03:49:02
<transcript>: Oh, does that make sense.

03:49:02
<transcript>: i don't

03:49:04
<transcript>: I don't know if it makes sense to me then.

03:49:06
<transcript>: I feel like.

03:49:08
caryyon: not really

03:49:09
caryyon: hahahaha

03:49:11
mecoupz: seperate the tab controls from the content

03:49:13
<transcript>: Really? Yeah. So the problem is.

03:49:18
<transcript>: Separate the tap controls from content so I could.

03:49:21
<transcript>: That seems like the sensible thing to do.

03:49:21
<transcript>: i guess

03:49:24
<transcript>: I guess the problem.

03:49:31
<transcript>: The problem I have with that is I'm using this css approach where we have this hidden radio input.

03:49:31
<transcript>: and it

03:49:35
<transcript>: And it needs to be a peer of the content itself. Okay.

03:49:39
<transcript>: But the hidden radio thing needs to live.

03:49:39
<transcript>: in

03:49:43
<transcript>: In the clickable thing. Right.

03:49:48
<transcript>: Or does it not need to.

03:49:53
<transcript>: Oh, maybe it doesn't need to can this be anywhere.

03:49:55
<transcript>: And this live anywhere.

03:49:59
<transcript>: It lives there.

03:50:02
caryyon: why cause it hsould just be targeted by the id

03:50:07
<transcript>: Let's get rid of the grid stuff for a second. I just got to do an experiment.

03:50:11
<transcript>: Column, span.

03:50:19
<transcript>: So if I if I put that there can this live anywhere because it's associated with that label.

03:50:19
<transcript>: does it

03:50:21
caryyon: the input is likely being targeted by the id you have on it

03:50:23
<transcript>: Does it just live anywhere. And that's fine. I don't think so. But.

03:50:28
<transcript>: No.

03:50:31
<transcript>: The input.

03:50:31
<transcript>: y

03:50:34
<transcript>: Y cause it should just be targeted by the ID.

03:50:40
<transcript>: So I think that the thing the input has to live.

03:50:45
<transcript>: Alongside this thing, right? It's appear.

03:50:49
<transcript>: Okay.

03:50:49
<transcript>: see my

03:50:51
<transcript>: See my conundrum.

03:50:55
<transcript>: Thanks Roger. Follow Mohammed.

03:50:59
<transcript>: Why is this so confusing.

03:50:59
<transcript>: this is why they did

03:51:05
<transcript>: This is why they did it with the absolute stuff that they did like for their approach.

03:51:11
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't love the content. The tab content living here inside.

03:51:14
<transcript>: Let's say I took this part out.

03:51:19
<transcript>: If I took this part out what would happen.

03:51:19
<transcript>: it wouldn't be

03:51:22
<transcript>: It wouldn't be. It would no longer be peer checked.

03:51:26
<transcript>: I would have to find another way.

03:51:26
<transcript>: to figure out

03:51:30
<transcript>: To figure out whether that specific input was.

03:51:37
<transcript>: Whether that specific input was being checked.

03:51:42
caryyon: so they are kind bound like this? | --- input tab --- | | --- content   --- |

03:51:42
<transcript>: But we maybe could do that. Or is there a way for me to accomplish this? Where.

03:51:42
<transcript>: the

03:51:45
<transcript>: The whole tab thing.

03:51:51
caryyon: ugh damn twitch chat messed that up

03:51:52
<transcript>: So they're kind of bound like this. Input tab content.

03:51:52
stroopwafel26: i'm just jamming to black keys rn, big fan

03:51:59
caryyon: those lines were supposed to line up

03:52:00
<transcript>: Yeah. Let me see if I can make your Twitch chat bigger and make that make sense.

03:52:02
<transcript>: Input Tab content.

03:52:02
<transcript>: yeah

03:52:04
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:52:11
<transcript>: Those lines are supposed to line up. Oh, you mean like, yeah, Yeah.

03:52:11
<transcript>: like stacked

03:52:13
<transcript>: Like stacked on top of each other.

03:52:16
caryyon: yup

03:52:18
<transcript>: So there cut. You're saying that's how they currently are kind of bound.

03:52:18
<transcript>: input tab

03:52:21
<transcript>: Input tab. Yeah. With the content below it.

03:52:21
<transcript>: yeah

03:52:26
caryyon: yea they are bound in a wrapping div

03:52:28
<transcript>: Yeah. The problem is right now is the content lives as a child of this outer thing.

03:52:36
<transcript>: Yeah, they're bounding a wrapping div. And that's my problem in terms of doing a grid layout.

03:52:36
<transcript>: is there another

03:52:43
<transcript>: Is there another layout that works? Or do I need to just figure out how to do this? Maybe I just need to use javascript even. But do I need to figure out how to.

03:52:52
<transcript>: I might still be able to use css. It just this would not be so simple. I wouldn't just be able to use peer checked. I'd have to use like some weird selector, but I. D or something.

03:52:52
<transcript>: think for the

03:52:59
<transcript>: Think for the follows bizognins or bosgans. I don't know where I can with the zogna.

03:52:59
<transcript>: and

03:53:02
<transcript>: And Josh dprts.

03:53:07
<transcript>: And carry on. Thank you, guys. Thank you for the follows.

03:53:08
<transcript>: Guys.

03:53:08
<transcript>: and girl

03:53:10
<transcript>: And girls.

03:53:15
<transcript>: Let's see. I'm almost done for the day. So I'm coming over to this camera because.

03:53:15
<transcript>: i'm gonna

03:53:19
<transcript>: I'm gonna be checking out here in just a few minutes. Thought I would talk.

03:53:29
<transcript>: Yeah. If anybody has any ideas about how I should do that, I was trying to avoid javascript because I knew there was a css only option.

03:53:39
<transcript>: I think it just means more complicated selector to get the check state of the radio. If it's not in the same, it's not a sibling of it. I think it's still possible.

03:53:39
<transcript>: that's probably the

03:53:44
<transcript>: That's probably the route I'll go is trying to like, tease that apart so I could use something like a grid layout.

03:53:49
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:53:54
<transcript>: But if there's a better option, it'd be great if there was just a really good open source.

03:53:54
<transcript>: accessible

03:53:59
<transcript>: Accessible tab control that's JavaScript just plain JavaScript.

03:53:59
<transcript>: no

03:54:02
<transcript>: None of this has to be react.

03:54:02
<transcript>: stuff

03:54:04
<transcript>: Stuff you know.

03:54:07
<transcript>: I'm just writing straight up JavaScript.

03:54:11
<transcript>: This has been fun. It's been fun. Building stuff.

03:54:11
<transcript>: here on twitt

03:54:14
<transcript>: Here on Twitter. It's funny every day.

03:54:14

<transcript>: I'm still getting stuff done.

03:54:23
