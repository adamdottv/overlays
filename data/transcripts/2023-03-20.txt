<transcript>: i

<transcript>: I only have an opportunity sometimes to peek into twitch on my phone, but those are seldom because I'm mostly with my two boys. I'm relieving my wife for the weekend.

00:15:59
<transcript>: So I'm not I'm not gonna miss every stream you ever do like, oh, I'm just gonna stream Saturday and Sundays. That would kill me. I guess also, you might stream at times that I just can't watch.

<transcript>: Cryo, you're having company. Oh, you're saying if there's gonna be any ladies joining us, why is it so predominantly male? What the twitch audience, the YouTube audience so heavily male. And I mean, I think it's because.

00:19:35
<transcript>: there's just

00:19:44
<transcript>: There's just it's still we have this issue where there's not a lot of women representation in tech or there's not enough. Like the skew is too skewed.

00:19:44
<transcript>: if you will

00:19:48
<transcript>: If you will sound like a Dr. Seuss line.

00:19:48
<transcript>: the skew

00:19:50

00:19:55
<transcript>: First thing. Wasn't that good anyway? Oh, it's okay, dev. The first. How many strange have I done.

00:19:59
<transcript>: The first.

00:19:59
<transcript>: i've probably

00:20:00
<transcript>: I've probably done like.

00:20:03
<transcript>: 200.

00:20:03
<transcript>: i'm gonna guess

00:20:06
<transcript>: I'm gonna guess 200, 100, 150.

00:20:06
<transcript>: the first

00:20:08
<transcript>: The first like 500 are probably bad.

00:20:08

kryotoboi: Do bots have genders ?

00:20:11
<transcript>: Someday we'll get good at this dev. Someday.

00:20:22
<transcript>: Okoufa. Hey. Ok. I'm going to get back to you by the way.

00:20:22
<transcript>: you

00:20:26
<transcript>: You sent me some stuff, and I'm gonna get back to you just wanted to let you know no one else knows what we're talking about.

00:20:39
<transcript>: But I do, and you do, and I'm gonna get back to you. I feel as if the quality of dev streamers having priests on twitch the past year. I feel it too akufa. I feel and I haven't been here for a whole year, but.

00:20:39
<transcript>: since i started

trivenge: watch.dev

00:21:02
<transcript>: I do feel like I'm watching. I'm watching it. It's growing. I see the space. There's more interest. That's what excites me about watch dev is. I'm just really passionate about this. Like I feel like streaming his injected something into my career that I really needed. Like things had gotten a little stale and crusty and.

00:21:02
<transcript>: boring

00:21:02
trivenge: rebase.tv

00:21:04
trivenge: POGGERS

00:21:10
<transcript>: Boring. Like just doing my work every day, alone in my office. And something about streaming. Was this unexpected.

00:21:17
<transcript>: Jolt of energy that I just loved so much. And I want other devs to experience that. And I do feel like.

00:21:23
<transcript>: It's a thing that is increasing. People are getting more curious about it, considering doing it themselves.

00:21:36
<transcript>: Which excites me a lot, because I do think I've just found so much joy in it. And I hope other people will find that joy. Some people might hate it. You might try it. You might not like it at all, but for the people who it clicks and you really enjoy it.

00:21:36
<transcript>: i really hope

00:21:49
<transcript>: I really hope they discover it. So that's the whole watch on that thing is like, I'm hoping to kind of, like, foster a little community of people that are really excited about getting into it. They maybe have thought about in the past. They just didn't know where to start. I'm gonna try and, like, I'm actually.

00:21:49
<transcript>: i

00:21:54
<transcript>: I say this. I say a lot of things that I'm gonna try and do, but I'm actually going to try.

00:21:54
<transcript>: i'm very passionate about

00:21:57
<transcript>: I'm very passionate about this. To create some kind of resources.

00:21:57
<transcript>: not just

00:21:58
juniornascm: Good morngin everyone

00:21:58
kiwifromearth: what a wholesome sentiment dear sir

00:22:05
kiwifromearth: your passion is duly noted

00:22:06
<transcript>: Not just be like big posts in the discord, like just how to get started. Things that I've learned in six months or so of streaming.

00:22:06
<transcript>: that maybe

00:22:08
trivenge: !discord

00:22:09
fossabot: Adam is a member of the watch.dev Discord server and he'd love to see you there: https://discord.gg/watchdotdev

00:22:09
<transcript>: That maybe I could play some people sometime I don't know.

00:22:09
<transcript>: and make

00:22:16
<transcript>: And make them more likely to get into it or just knock down some hurdles or something. Taylor our clocks change on the 27th.

00:22:32
<transcript>: Seven days, one week from today. All right. Okay. Overa. Should I start this week? Start streaming? Yep. You should overa that's very on topic. I may be a little behind, but that was perfectly timed.

00:22:32
<transcript>: frag

00:22:39

00:22:40
trivenge: heading toshower be back in a short bit

00:22:48
<transcript>: Yes. What are you gonna build? Drag. I want to know more. Tell me more. A Hype train is close. Well, that's.

00:22:48
<transcript>: i'm sorry that

00:22:54
<transcript>: I'm sorry. That's kind of pitiful. How would we get a Hype train we've had after two subs.

00:22:54
<transcript>: is that

00:22:56
<transcript>: Is that how out of the game I am.

00:22:59
<transcript>: Are they just showing pity on me.

00:23:02
<transcript>: No, I really appreciate those two subsets, though.

00:23:02
<transcript>: i just

00:23:05
<transcript>: I just I'm a little surprised hype train.

00:23:05
<transcript>: is that

00:23:07
overra_dev: Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1

00:23:09
<transcript>: Is that I train worthy? I don't know. Maybe.

00:23:15
<transcript>: I'll be working over. Thank you for the seven bits trying to get that Hype trained.

00:23:20
<transcript>: I thought you gotta do a lot more for hypetrain. I just thought they were, like, harder to get than that.

00:23:20
<transcript>: but

00:23:21
tayloreddev: you can control what triggers a hype train I think

00:23:21
<transcript>: But.

00:23:32
<transcript>: Dev you'll be working on most of your projects live. That's the easiest way to get into it is if you can stream stuff you would already be doing.

00:23:52
<transcript>: You're gonna have a good time because it's not gonna be a stretch to, like, make time for it. It's really hard. The first go around. I was kind of doing what I would normally do, but I was directionless, and I didn't really know what I wanted to do in my career, so I ended up doing a lot of other stuff that I probably shouldn't have done.

00:23:52
<transcript>: and

00:23:55
<transcript>: And it was just like, what would be an interviewing thing to work on.

00:23:55
<transcript>: now

00:24:03
<transcript>: Now this go around. It's very much more sustainable. It's a lot more sustainable because I'm just working on my day job, like I'm just doing what I need to do every day.

00:24:14
<transcript>: Plus talking to you all for, like, half the time. But I'm also just streaming a portion of my day, so it's like, I know I don't get as much done during that portion. That's okay. It's like my social time.

00:24:14
<transcript>: this is i

00:24:17
<transcript>: This is. I don't get out. This is my social time.

00:24:27
<transcript>: Yeah. So working on most of your projects live. So Dev you will. This is something I'm gonna put in writing. At some point, you will probably.

00:24:27
<transcript>: get distract

00:24:42
<transcript>: Get distracted building some overlays and some things automation things ChannelPoint things like as dead's. I feel like most of the Dev streamers I've seen have gone down this path and I went down at hard.

00:24:42
<transcript>: you

00:24:54
<transcript>: You get excited like there's twitch api's. You're gonna build something cool for your stream and us as a category as software and dev or software in game development as a category like we uniquely.

00:24:54
<transcript>: are positioned

00:24:56
<transcript>: Are positioned to do that. We know how to build stuff.

00:24:56
<transcript>: like with

00:24:58

00:26:14
<transcript>: The community appreciates it.

00:26:22
<transcript>: Excuse me? That would be a creatively done bot that transcribed to Chat gpt. Then put it back. Yeah, you could use whisper.

00:26:27
<transcript>: You could stick with one vendor, use their two APIs.

00:26:29
<transcript>: And handle that.

00:26:32
<transcript>: Thank you. I am Kiwi. There we go again.

00:27:57
sockthedev: loving the idea of watch.dev - avoiding my discord server fatigue

00:28:04
<transcript>: Calf faces. Do you remember those days? You remember my phase of just building twitch Automation stuff? It's hard to escape. It as a dev. It's just like it's gonna happen.

00:28:09
<transcript>: Julius, where is your mic? It's right above me. I use a shotgun. Mic.

00:28:09
<transcript>: you

00:28:13
<transcript>: You might see it in the next range of the thing. I lowered it too. Lower it's like on my forehead right now.

00:28:13
<transcript>: but

00:28:29
<transcript>: But it picks up the keyboard really well, there's another little tip. If you're like a dev streamer, people like to hear your keyboard. And if you use like a smb or it's a sure essen, I remember the name of it. If you use an SM.

00:28:35
thetonykano: SM8B

00:28:38
fragaverage: SM7B

00:28:39
thetonykano: SM7B*

00:28:40
fragaverage: LUL

00:28:47
<transcript>: Seven B I think sm Seven B is after called it's a really nice mic but if you use it then the keyboard won't be picked up. It's not going to be picked up so much and people will notice.

00:28:47
<transcript>: they'll say

00:28:49
<transcript>: They'll say, What's your keyboard sound like? It looks nice.

00:28:53
<transcript>: So use a shotgun mic picks up your voice.

00:28:53
<transcript>: and if it's

00:28:57
<transcript>: And if it's with the keyboard and you don't have a microphone on your face, it's just a lot of winds.

00:28:58
sockthedev: just has a casual SM7B laying around picking up dust 🙈

00:29:01
<transcript>: Okay. I'm caught up. I'm so caught up, I can see the last message.

00:29:01
<transcript>: oh wow

00:29:03
<transcript>: Oh, wow, he's behind.

00:29:03
<transcript>: hi adam

00:29:03
overra_dev: there might be an opportunity for us new streamers to collab on some dev streamer tools

00:29:06
<transcript>: Hi, Adam. Hey, sock is here.

00:29:20
<transcript>: But yet I'm doing good. Thanks. Well, that's great. Sock loving the idea of watch a desk of avoiding my discord server fatigue. Yes. Join watch, dev, help us make it a little home for us. It's my only true home on discord.

00:29:20
<transcript>: and

00:29:20
juliusdotdev: Tuning in back later, have fun!

00:29:24
<transcript>: And I want to feel cozy. I'm gonna spend more time in there.

00:29:25
devagrawal09: i am excited for watch dot dev

00:29:26
thetonykano: You can get the SM7B to pick it up, but at that point getting a condenser mic would be better.

00:29:27
overra_dev: later @juliusdotdev

00:29:29
<transcript>: Thank you, sm. Seven B. That's what it's going for.

00:29:29
<transcript>: just

00:29:37
<transcript>: Just as a casual smile. I use it for I used it for the podcast because it does avoid picking up my kids.

00:29:45
<transcript>: You guys have to listen to my kids when they come stomping around in the morning, when they wake up here in 30 minutes, actually an hour and a half.

00:29:45
<transcript>: but that

00:29:48
<transcript>: But that SM seven B, it doesn't pick up then so much.

00:29:48
<transcript>: it mostly pick

00:29:53
<transcript>: It mostly picks up my voice because it's like this. And I just hold it right in front of my face.

00:29:53
<transcript>: and you can't see

00:29:57
<transcript>: And you can't see me on the podcast. I don't care, but I don't like it in the frame.

00:30:02
<transcript>: There might be an opportunity for us new streamers to collab on some Dev streamer tools.

00:30:02
<transcript>: there could be

00:30:04
devagrawal09: i realized it's pretty much impossible to stream without a second monitor

00:30:06
<transcript>: There could be overra. I love the energy. Let's do it.

00:30:06
<transcript>: tuning

00:30:10
<transcript>: Tuning in back later. Thanks, julius. We'll see you later.

00:30:10
<transcript>: i'm excited for

00:30:16
<transcript>: I'm excited for watch. Dev. Me, too. Dev. Let's make it happen let's make it a thing let's make it happen let's make it a thing.

00:30:24
<transcript>: Let's do it. I'm very excited about it. You can get the sm Seven B to pick it up, but at that point, getting a condenser mic would be better.

00:30:26
<transcript>: Now a lot of people.

00:30:26
<transcript>: tony

00:30:46
<transcript>: Tony, I've noticed a lot of people come into this channel and they know things about audio. And I get the sense. I know this is just like one little data point. But I get the sense. You know, some things about audio. And we even had a channel before dax killed all the fun in our server. We had a channel for audio and gear because I think I attract that type. I've got a lot of audio gear. I got a lot of stuff.

00:30:46
<transcript>: cameras

00:30:47
<transcript>: Cameras.

00:30:47
<transcript>: and

00:30:56
<transcript>: And people who show up here, they seem to appreciate that. So I may have just read into a lot. You just know what S. M. Seven B is, but.

00:30:56
<transcript>: you know

00:31:03
<transcript>: You know what condenser mics are, too? That's the word probably that tipped me off. That, you know, stuff, you know, things.

00:31:03
<transcript>: okay

00:31:07
<transcript>: Okay. I realize it's pretty much impossible. Stream of that second monitor. Yeah. Dev.

00:31:07
<transcript>: like

00:31:15
<transcript>: Like I only work on one monitor, but I do have this second monitor up as my teleprompter makes it a lot easier to just have chat on one monitor.

00:31:15
<transcript>: and

00:31:18
<transcript>: And I can peek over at it when I want.

00:31:18

00:35:56
lautadisalvo1998: Hi, gretting from argentina :)

00:36:00
<transcript>: I'm gonna have to build a second table, and then the columns. You can't sort them, whereas we're gonna build column sorting into this table. So I'm just using the table that we use everywhere else on status. All of this needs some good TLC on the design side, and we're gonna get there, but yeah, for now.

00:36:00
<transcript>: i'm just

<transcript>: Frontend. Okay. Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything you're gonna see.

00:36:46
<transcript>: Related to frontend on the stream because I don't profess the be a front end developer. I just do it a lot.

00:36:50
<transcript>: Unfortunately, I'm not very good at it.

00:37:04
<transcript>: Okay, so we did this. Now we need to do a football game. An American Football game. I gotta start building out the other sports. And I think it's mostly the same. Like team stats is just different stats, but otherwise.

00:37:04
<transcript>: same layout

00:37:05
<transcript>: Same layout.

00:37:05
<transcript>: play

00:37:15
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:37:17
<transcript>: Let me know if it's not.

00:37:25
<transcript>: So then it's got playerstats just different grids. But it's the same. Basically, all this is the same. The only thing it has is this summary.

00:37:25
<transcript>: which is new it's a

00:37:31
<transcript>: Which is new. It's a scoring summary. So that's unique to football. I gotta build that real quick, but that shouldn't be hard.

<transcript>: And then we want to go to.

00:38:20
<transcript>: schema

00:38:21
<transcript>: Schema.

00:38:30
<transcript>: Wait a minute. Paginated, paginated, that's not a one game answer.

00:38:30
<transcript>: that's what i want

00:38:31
<transcript>: That's what I want.

00:38:34
<transcript>: And we're gonna go, schema.

00:38:36
<transcript>: Visual.

00:38:40
<transcript>: Excuse me.

00:38:42
<transcript>: Detail.

00:38:42
<transcript>: vis

00:38:43
<transcript>: Visual detail.

00:38:43
<transcript>: yeah

00:38:45
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:38:50
<transcript>: So we're gonna build NFL Historical Box Square. That's what I've got right now. This interface.

00:38:51
dofha: hello, what is sst ?

00:38:57
<transcript>: I got to find it in here. Nfl Historical box score. Here's the shape of that thing.

00:39:01
<transcript>: You know what? How did I do this before.

00:39:06
<transcript>: Did I just do an example? I think I just did an example. So, like.

00:39:06
<transcript>: how do i find

00:39:10
<transcript>: How do I find the ID for a game? Here's what I'll do.

00:39:14
<transcript>: Oh, that's the NBA one. Let's do this.

00:39:14
juniornascm: !sst

00:39:14
fossabot: SST is the best way to create modern applications on AWS, and Dax (@thdxr) is a co-founder there. https://sst.dev

00:39:16
<transcript>: Like this.

00:39:16
<transcript>: what

00:39:23
<transcript>: What is? Ssd? Dafa. Welcome to Chat. Hello, Renee.

00:39:26
<transcript>: Welcome to both of you.

00:39:26
<transcript>: thanks for

00:39:29
<transcript>: Thanks for that Junior, for hitting the command for him.

00:39:29
<transcript>: thanks for the

00:39:32
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow UFA.

00:39:37
<transcript>: Okay. What's I doing. I'm gonna do this.

00:39:42
<transcript>: And this is gonna fail. I think.

00:39:42
<transcript>: no it was

00:39:43
<transcript>: No, it was.

00:39:43
<transcript>: oh wow

00:39:49
<transcript>: Oh, wow. It works pretty well. The day just missing turnovers is the thing in both sports. So that just works.

00:39:52
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow wiltsha.

00:39:59
<transcript>: So. Okay. This is surprisingly working better than I expected. This is just working straight up.

00:39:59
<transcript>: the same

00:40:03
<transcript>: The same as mba because it's just these generic grid things.

00:40:03
<transcript>: cool

00:40:04
<transcript>: Cool.

00:40:09
<transcript>: So we just need to add another tab, and we need to finish. Oh, yeah, yeah? I wanted to log.

00:40:09
<transcript>: let's

00:40:10
rene_p8: !today

00:40:11
fossabot: Today Adam is working on statmuse.com, a website for sports nerds.

00:40:18
<transcript>: Let's see NFL component box or we're gonna log this data so I can see the ID console log.

00:40:18
<transcript>: data

00:40:19
<transcript>: Data.

00:40:22
<transcript>: I get the shape of this thing.

00:40:32
<transcript>: I guess the logging will happen over here, right.

00:40:37
<transcript>: Refresh this.

00:40:41
<transcript>: Did I do it.

00:40:41
<transcript>: did i

00:40:42
<transcript>: Did I not do it.

00:40:45
<transcript>: Did I save it.

00:40:48
<transcript>: May not have saved it. I didn't save it.

00:40:53
<transcript>: Seriously? My brain feels so slow.

00:40:53
<transcript>: why am i feeling

00:40:55
<transcript>: Why am I feeling so slow this morning.

00:40:55
<transcript>: did we

00:41:04
<transcript>: Did we log it? Oh, maybe we're not using the NFL. Oh, I know what's going on. I haven't done this part yet. So NFL Box Score is a component.

00:41:09
juniornascm: how astro get the data?

00:41:13
<transcript>: And on this page, on the game page, this one right now I'm just showing mba box for but what we need to do is like a switch statement.

00:41:18
<transcript>: Can you just do, like a switch statement in here? That would be cool, actually.

00:41:18
<transcript>: switch

00:41:19
<transcript>: Switch on data.

00:41:24
<transcript>: Just domain, I guess.

00:41:29
<transcript>: I do this. Can I do a switch statement in here? I don't think I can.

00:41:29
<transcript>: that's

00:41:32
<transcript>: That's making me think I can't.

00:41:35
<transcript>: Unless I just need to actually have one.

00:41:37
<transcript>: Nba.

00:41:40
<transcript>: Nba Box store.

00:41:48
<transcript>: This isn't gonna work.

00:41:52
<transcript>: I guess return.

00:41:56
<transcript>: And then like default.

00:42:05
<transcript>: I don't know. I'm just trying to see if this is possible. Someone could probably just tell me if you can't do this.

00:42:08
bausmeier: You can wrap it in an IIFE.

00:42:11
<transcript>: Yeah. Can't do so shape it. I just like, that would be kind of elegant.

00:42:11
<transcript>: wrap

00:42:14
<transcript>: Wrap it in one of those things. Like a function thing.

00:42:18
<transcript>: Is that best. Should I do that.

00:42:22
<transcript>: So it'd be like.

00:42:28
<transcript>: That or something.

00:42:29
bausmeier: I don't like that option, but you can :)

00:42:32
<transcript>: So bad at javascript. Oh, I forgot return.

00:42:38
juniornascm: You cant create in code? and render a variable like in jsx?

00:42:39
<transcript>: Do I just not remember how switch statements work.

00:42:48
<transcript>: You can't create in code and render a variable like in jsx. Maybe I should just do this differently.

00:42:50
mnxygraphics: don't you need case too?

00:42:56
<transcript>: If the fact that I've never done a switch statement in like jsx or an Astro maybe oh I didn't do case.

00:42:57
structuredchris: need case before "NBA"

00:43:04
<transcript>: Oh, thank you, Manixy. Welcome to Chat as well.

00:43:04
<transcript>: i

00:43:07
kryotoboi: Forget Js, Vbscript is where its at !

00:43:10
<transcript>: I don't like that option, but you can. Yeah. Yeah. This is a bad option. The fact that I've never done this, there's probably a reason, right.

00:43:10
<transcript>: let's

00:43:14
<transcript>: Let's see that tag. Nope.

00:43:18
<transcript>: Delete that.

00:43:18
<transcript>: and let's just

00:43:25
<transcript>: And let's just paste it here. And then we're gonna get rid of all that same for the follow mckl.

00:43:28
stroopwafel26: hello happy monday

00:43:30
<transcript>: Mickel vbc. Is where it's at? Alright.

00:43:30
<transcript>: yeah

00:43:33
<transcript>: Yeah. Need case. Okay. So we're not doing that.

00:43:37
<transcript>: We're not doing that. We're gonna do something else we're gonna do.

00:43:37
<transcript>: prettier

00:43:48
<transcript>: Prettier. Woke up into violence. I don't have formatting. Not cool, not cool. Prettier. Why does this happen to me? It's because I choose to use things like Neil them. I.

00:43:48
<transcript>: mean i love

00:43:56
<transcript>: Mean, I love new them. That's not a knock on Neil them. It's just like I choose this life of like, tinkering with my ID. And when I have to tinker with it, I'm upset.

00:44:02
<transcript>: Junior how astro? Get the data? We get the data we have.

00:44:02
<transcript>: a lot of ways

00:44:18
<transcript>: A lot of ways that we get the data as a live data we get from Sport radar. I think strup is here and then we get the now I'm gonna spend ten minutes trying to figure out ten minutes so generous. I'm gonna spend like, an hour trying to figure out why prettier won't save or won't format my file.

00:44:22
<transcript>: I don't have the null LS.

00:44:22
<transcript>: log

00:44:24
<transcript>: Logging anymore.

00:44:25
stroopwafel26: HeyGuys

00:44:29
<transcript>: I don't have it because.

00:44:30
aj_stuyvenberg: helloooooooooooo

00:44:32
<transcript>: I don't use null ls for prettier anymore.

00:44:32
<transcript>: why

00:44:35
<transcript>: Why doesn't it work.

00:44:37
<transcript>: No.

00:44:37
<transcript>: not like

00:44:39
<transcript>: Not like this.

00:44:41
kryotoboi: Are we setting beauty standards for code ?

00:44:44
cowfacedude99: prettier doesn't work?

00:44:50
<transcript>: Aj's here. Are we setting beauty standards for code? Well, you know, I like to have pretty or just run, you know.

00:44:50
<transcript>: prettier's not working

00:44:57
<transcript>: Prettier's not working cafes all of a sudden randomly on a Monday morning. I didn't update anything like I did. Nothing.

00:45:01
<transcript>: Do I just need to, like, restart prettier or something.

00:45:04
<transcript>: Like system control.

00:45:04
<transcript>: restart

00:45:08
bausmeier: Are you in the correct directory? Sometime I get that in monorepos when I'm in the root of the repo instead of in a specific package directory.

00:45:09
<transcript>: Restart pretty early or something. I don't know. Is that even real.

00:45:11
<transcript>: System no.

00:45:12
kryotoboi: Code beauty pageant

00:45:17
<transcript>: Even the correct directory. Sometimes I get that in monterey. Oh.

00:45:22
<transcript>: Hello, Stammy.com. Yeah, I think so.

00:45:29
<transcript>: I guess I could do this PDP wdp.

00:45:29
<transcript>: oh you know what

00:45:32
<transcript>: Oh, you know what? It might not be actually.

00:45:32
<transcript>: it should be

00:45:33
cowfacedude99: update mason

00:45:35
<transcript>: It should be in a subdirectory.

00:45:37
zxshan: https://media.giphy.com/media/DUtVdGeIU8lmo/giphy.gif

00:45:38
<transcript>: Let's just do this.

00:45:42
zxshan: @adamdotdev

00:45:43
<transcript>: Let's just quit Neoven and restart it. It's been up for a while. I mean, this needs a little restart.

00:45:44
sockthedev: This happened to me Adam. I had switched on `debug = true` in my Null ls and then did a save, followed by :NullLsLog

00:45:46
<transcript>: Let's go to game.

00:45:49
<transcript>: Here we go.

00:45:51
<transcript>: Did it work.

00:45:53
<transcript>: A little restart, maybe.

00:45:53
<transcript>: ooh

00:45:55
<transcript>: Ooh.

00:46:00
sockthedev: Saw that a prettier plugin wasn't installed into my node_modules properly

00:46:01
<transcript>: Oh, it's because there's linting errors. They just weren't showing up, so it wasn't pretty fault. Maybe.

00:46:05
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:46:05
<transcript>: are you

00:46:09
<transcript>: Are you in the correct directory? Okay, that way. We just check that. We just check that.

00:46:09
<transcript>: things follow

00:46:11
<transcript>: Things follow.

00:46:11
<transcript>: jerry

00:46:12
<transcript>: Jerry store.

00:46:20
<transcript>: The struggle. It's gonna be a struggle to get through this stream. I don't know why? My voice.

00:46:20
<transcript>: and my eyes

00:46:24
<transcript>: And my eyes feel like they've been asleep this entire time.

00:46:27
sockthedev: Sucks when prettier stops working

00:46:28
structuredchris: what were you doing with that switch?

00:46:30
<transcript>: Maybe I'm sick.

00:46:35
<transcript>: This happened to me. Adam. I had switched on debug equals true in my nols and then do the save.

00:46:35
<transcript>: so

00:46:41
zxshan: Where's the larabar

00:46:43
<transcript>: So I I normally would go. Nol ls log. I don't actually run. No ls anymore. I switched over to what dax uses.

00:46:45
<transcript>: And.

00:46:45
<transcript>: his

00:46:47
<transcript>: His changes.

00:46:47
<transcript>: i don't use

00:46:51
devagrawal09: @zxshan ooh good question

00:46:52
<transcript>: I don't use it. No ls anymore, but I think it's just a matter of this type.

00:46:52
<transcript>: that thing

00:46:53
<transcript>: That thing.

00:46:53
<transcript>: game

00:46:55
<transcript>: Gamera inbox.

00:46:55
<transcript>: or all

00:46:58
zxshan: ^

00:46:59
<transcript>: Or all that stuff. Data is not the right shape or something.

00:46:59
<transcript>: if one of those

00:47:07
<transcript>: If one of those four things India box will requires that it is specifically an mba box score.

00:47:07
<transcript>: so

00:47:13
<transcript>: So we're gonna fix that. And it's gonna fix our problem with the NFL. Two, we're gonna say.

00:47:17
<transcript>: We're gonna say data.

00:47:20
<transcript>: How do I want to do this.

00:47:20
<transcript>: domain

00:47:21
<transcript>: Domain.

00:47:25
<transcript>: Equals MBA.

00:47:27
<transcript>: And.

00:47:29
<transcript>: Then that.

00:47:33
<transcript>: Else? No, I don't know.

00:47:33
<transcript>: is this way to do it

00:47:34
kryotoboi: I literally woke up today with a higher power. Friday night I could read my laptop screen from my usual seating position.  Todays its all a big blur

00:47:36
<transcript>: Is this way to do it now is domain, not a thing.

00:47:39
<transcript>: I guess I can do this. I don't think.

00:47:39
<transcript>: it's gonna be

00:47:41
<transcript>: It's gonna be smart enough.

00:47:41
<transcript>: to know

00:47:46
<transcript>: To know if domain equals mba that the NBA boxware is Typed correctly. I don't think so.

00:47:49
<transcript>: Oh, where's the larab Bar? Oh, no.

00:47:49
<transcript>: what

00:47:55
<transcript>: What were you doing with that switch? So structured? I was, I'm gonna have to have a different.

00:47:55
<transcript>: nba

00:48:00
<transcript>: Nba or different box score component depending on the sport let me get my larvae hang on.

00:48:06
<transcript>: Okay.

00:48:12
<transcript>: Now there's a larbar on my desk. Don't worry about it. Nothing to see here.

00:48:12
<transcript>: domain

00:48:14
<transcript>: Domain equals MBA.

00:48:18
cowfacedude99: I think you need to typecast data.

00:48:25
<transcript>: So data is gamer mba box for what's the problem.

00:48:28
<transcript>: What's the problem, then.

00:48:34
<transcript>: Fingers are slow too. I might be sick. I don't know.

00:48:46
<transcript>: I literally woke up today with a higher power Friday night, I could read my laptop screen from my usual seating position.

00:48:46
<transcript>: today

00:48:48
<transcript>: Today it's all Big blur.

00:48:52
<transcript>: Need to type cast today.

00:48:58
<transcript>: Actually, when I just be able to see the full error, that would be cool.

00:48:58
<transcript>: but for some reason

00:49:00
<transcript>: But for some reason it's not popping up.

00:49:00
<transcript>: in a

00:49:02
<transcript>: In a popup.

00:49:02
<transcript>: it's just showing it over

00:49:06
<transcript>: It's just showing it over there on the side and I can't read the whole thing, you know.

00:49:09
devagrawal09: try not using vim

00:49:11
cowfacedude99: try lua

00:49:12
<transcript>: There's something wrong with my editor.

00:49:12
<transcript>: try not using

00:49:14
<transcript>: Try not using them.

00:49:14
<transcript>: it's a good

00:49:18
<transcript>: It's a good call. Try lua. We'll do. What with lua.

00:49:18
<transcript>: like

00:49:21
<transcript>: Like I could eat. I could find out what the air is.

00:49:25
<transcript>: If I weren't using if I didn't use lua.

00:49:31
<transcript>: What is it not like about this? Because like this.

00:49:43
<transcript>: Data has to be a gamera box score. Right and right now Data is Typed. Is a gamera mba box score. What is the problem.

00:49:48
<transcript>: Same type, right? Yeah. The emory NBA Box for.

00:49:48
juniornascm: i think tou can use switch, here is a issue maybe related https://github.com/withastro/compiler/issues/493

00:49:53
cowfacedude99: lua vim.diagnostics.opn_flot()

00:49:56
<transcript>: You can use a switch.

00:49:57
sockthedev: but it is a union

00:49:58
<transcript>: Oh Oh.

00:50:01
<transcript>: Option float.

00:50:01
devagrawal09: does data={data} work?

00:50:02
cowfacedude99: open_float*

00:50:03
sockthedev: do you not have to narrow the type

00:50:06
<transcript>: Lua. Vim. Diagnostics. Diagnostic.

00:50:11
<transcript>: Option flot. This is supposed to be float.

00:50:12
structuredchris: ooo instead of switch could use a Record maybe and index with the data.domain? to return the component

00:50:14
<transcript>: It's Index diagnostics.

00:50:20
<transcript>: I feel like I probably have an here. I probably have like a key bind for this.

00:50:25
<transcript>: Let's do this.

00:50:30
sockthedev: it could be an Nfl score for example

00:50:33
<transcript>: And let's do this.

00:50:41
<transcript>: Let's see, let's see.

00:50:41
<transcript>: i

00:50:44
cowfacedude99: slippery fingers LUL

00:50:44
<transcript>: I probably have a key bind for this.

00:50:48
<transcript>: Plugin. Oh, I comment. It out. Cool.

00:50:54
<transcript>: Don't want to update stuff then I know things will be broken.

00:50:54
<transcript>: ls

00:50:56
<transcript>: Lsp Here we go.

00:51:00
<transcript>: So where is my key bank keep buying for.

00:51:03
<transcript>: That's CMP.

00:51:05
<transcript>: Select next.

00:51:08
thetonykano: so theres NeoVIM, VSCode, and sublime that I hear people use. Why do you use vim?

00:51:11
<transcript>: What's wrong with this undefined, global vim.

00:51:15
<transcript>: What.

00:51:17
<transcript>: Axe. What did you do.

00:51:20
<transcript>: What did you do.

00:51:21
cowfacedude99: @TheTonyKano he uses neovim.

00:51:22
devagrawal09: @TheTonyKano it is neovim

00:51:25
juniornascm: is K

00:51:27
<transcript>: Lsp definition.

00:51:27
<transcript>: k

00:51:27
juniornascm: i think

00:51:29
<transcript>: K is.

00:51:40
<transcript>: Workspace symbol open float leader vd. I would have never guessed that. What does that come from? Next? Open float.

00:51:40
<transcript>: okay

00:51:43
<transcript>: Okay. Let's try that.

00:51:45
<transcript>: So leader.

00:51:47
<transcript>: There we go.

00:51:47
<transcript>: type

00:51:52
<transcript>: Type gamera, Mbach Score, NFL box or it's probably no.

00:51:55
tunvior: view diagnostics?

00:51:56
daglee: The lsp doesn't import vim by default anymore. It's not a problem tbh.

00:52:01
<transcript>: Type camera. Nfl is not a signal. Yep, but I thought data. I thought I'd. I thought I'd narrowed it down because domain equals MBA.

00:52:01
<transcript>: right

00:52:09
<transcript>: Right. So now it's narrowed down. Oh, no, that's just saying the prop has to be, but data is still not narrowed down. Okay.

00:52:18
<transcript>: Dagley. Thank you. The lsp doesn't import them by default anymore. It's not a problem. Okay, so I can leave it for now.

00:52:25
kryotoboi: There used to Atom in that list once upon a time

00:52:27
<transcript>: So there's no vm code sublime that I hear people use. Why do you use them? I just enjoy the tinkering.

00:52:27
<transcript>: i

00:52:31
<transcript>: I say that and then when I need to tinker I'm like man.

00:52:34
<transcript>: Minimal Think about follow.

00:52:39
<transcript>: So I guess I don't love the tinkering do I.

00:52:39
<transcript>: does

00:52:51
<transcript>: Does data equal data work? Oh, I don't think so. Dev. I think the date, the way I did the shorthand syntax was just covering up the fact that the data is not actually narrowed. It's not been narrowed down to the type I need it to be.

00:52:57
<transcript>: We could just cast it, but I'm not gonna do that. We're gonna do fancy typescript, stuff.

00:53:01
dofha: omg your keyboard is so neat

00:53:08
<transcript>: Instead of switch. Could use a record, maybe an index with the data domain to return the component. Oh, that's a cool idea. I like that.

00:53:16
<transcript>: Try water for my voice. Maybe the dandy blend is not helping.

00:53:19
stroopwafel26: what keyboard? I only saw a larabar

00:53:19
<transcript>: Poseidon. Thanks for that follow.

00:53:25
<transcript>: My keyboard is so neat. I do love my keyboard. I love my keyboards. They're also great.

00:53:29
<transcript>: I only saw Laura. Barbara. That's funny.

00:53:36
<transcript>: Used to Adam in that list. Once a pie on time used to be Adam and oh, like in terms of Editors. I used to use Adam.

00:53:36
<transcript>: because it

00:53:39
<transcript>: Because it sounds like my name. I really did.

00:53:39
<transcript>: okay

00:53:40
<transcript>: Okay.

00:53:40
<transcript>: let's do this

00:53:41
<transcript>: Let's do this.

00:53:41
<transcript>: so

00:53:42
<transcript>: So.

00:53:44
premiare: RIP Ato

00:53:46
premiare: Atom**

00:53:50
devagrawal09: you might have to do casting, typescript doesn't quite narrow down an object type if you check it's properties

00:53:53
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. I want to look at these types. I know there's a way that I narrowed these. So NBA box for is box score base.

00:54:00
<transcript>: Maybe there wasn't a way that I narrowed them.

00:54:05
12zhunus: Remap it to wtf =)

00:54:08
<transcript>: Camera NBA box for there's no way for me to narrow it with fancy stuff right now, is there.

00:54:08
structuredchris: just make a type guard :)

00:54:11
<transcript>: Remap it to wtf. Welcome to chat.

00:54:11
<transcript>: twelve

00:54:12
<transcript>: Twelve.

00:54:13
<transcript>: Hundred.

00:54:16
<transcript>: Make a typeguard.

00:54:24
<transcript>: Yeah. Maybe that's what we'll be doing. I just for some reason, I thought there was some way here where we did something fancy with the domain or something. But maybe not.

00:54:26
<transcript>: Be a team game stats and be a team.

00:54:26
<transcript>: i just want to

00:54:29
<transcript>: I just want to make sure there's not something cool I can do here.

00:54:29
<transcript>: i'm always

00:54:32
<transcript>: I'm always trying to do something cool when I can do something cool.

00:54:41
<transcript>: Don't listen to me. Don't do what I do. Do as I say. Well, don't do what I say either. Cuz that's not good. I'm saying bad things.

00:54:41
<transcript>: home team so

00:54:44
<transcript>: Home team. So this is our box score.

00:54:44
<transcript>: and

00:54:46
<transcript>: And then.

00:54:46
<transcript>: gamor

00:54:49
<transcript>: Gamora generic grids detail. See.

00:54:54
<transcript>: Nhl box for detail what I already made this one.

00:55:01
<transcript>: Like I didn't. Oh, no. Maybe I did. Okay.

00:55:10
thetonykano: @12zhunus As long as wtf = itworks i guess lol

00:55:11
trivenge: !youtube

00:55:13
trivenge: !yt

00:55:14
<transcript>: I don't know why I already have not one made, and I didn't have enough film made. So visual. Here's where we have the domain. Right here. Okay.

00:55:14
tunvior: i'd like to buy a mechanical keyboard but i don't want to spend too much and i don't like too much noise, any suggestions? (sorry OT)

00:55:19
rambo247: Morning everyone

00:55:25
<transcript>: Here's where we have. Oh, trib, I've got to make a command for that. I still have a command from a YouTube. It's in my like. I have links to all my socials on my Twitch.

00:55:31
aj_stuyvenberg: @Tunvior check out keychron

00:55:34
<transcript>: I'd like to buy a mechanical keyboard, but I don't want to spend too much and I don't like too much noise. Any suggestions? I'm not off topic. There is no topic.

00:55:39
kryotoboi: @tunvior MxKeys ?

00:55:46
<transcript>: So not spending much money is my struggle because I've bought extensive keyboards. Anyone have recommendations on keyboards that meant that meet ten viewers. Criteria.

00:55:52
<transcript>: Check out Key Cron.

00:55:55
structuredchris: lol i use an Anne pro 2

00:55:55
<transcript>: Good morning. Rambo.

00:55:58
cowfacedude99: @Tunvior keycron.

00:55:58
juniornascm: I have an anne pro 2, best keyboard i ever used

00:55:59
tunvior: ty guys, i'll check those out

00:56:01
<transcript>: So here's where I know on the visual. I know the domain. Right here. Right.

00:56:01
<transcript>: and then

00:56:04
<transcript>: And then we just extend visual.

00:56:04
<transcript>: with these

00:56:05
<transcript>: With these.

00:56:07
<transcript>: Detail.

00:56:07
<transcript>: like this

00:56:07
structuredchris: @juniornascm yessss

00:56:08
<transcript>: Like this.

00:56:12
<transcript>: So could I.

00:56:15
<transcript>: Actually.

00:56:15
<transcript>: actually

00:56:19
<transcript>: Actually watch this. What if I did this? What if I said domain.

00:56:19
<transcript>: is

00:56:22
<transcript>: Is MBA.

00:56:25
<transcript>: So if the visuals domain is MBA.

00:56:29
<transcript>: I think this is gonna work.

00:56:30
structuredchris: ITS tiny though lol gotta make custom arrow keys for coding

00:56:32
<transcript>: I think it's gonna work.

00:56:32
<transcript>: and this one would be

00:56:35
<transcript>: And this one would be NFL. So hear me out if it's MBA.

00:56:38
<transcript>: Then this is what the detail looks like.

00:56:42
juniornascm: @juniornascm love this keyboard man, my only problem is that i wanted a metal body

00:56:42
<transcript>: Or if it's NBA, you know, it's an mba. Visual. Right.

00:56:45
<transcript>: Right.

00:56:45
porkyyepper: don't you just have to pass it as const to make it not a sting but this specific string.

00:56:53
<transcript>: So hear me out. If we do that, then I can go back to my game.

00:56:59
<transcript>: Here. And we can say not domain, but.

00:57:01
<transcript>: So if.

00:57:01
<transcript>: data

00:57:02
<transcript>: Data.

00:57:02
<transcript>: visual

00:57:05
<transcript>: Visual Dot domain.

00:57:08
<transcript>: Does It work.

00:57:12
juniornascm: @structuredchris i use mine in abnt2 so i dont have ayway to do | \ withou a custom macro

00:57:13
<transcript>: This domain is NBA. Oh, no, we can't have it in the we can't have it up here.

00:57:21
<transcript>: It can't be here, because then that'll mess up with our typing. Right. So it's only in the direction.

00:57:21
<transcript>: like the

00:57:23
<transcript>: Like the more specific types.

00:57:26
<transcript>: That work. Oh.

00:57:29
<transcript>: Come on.

00:57:32
<transcript>: Typescript. You can do it.

00:57:32
<transcript>: he's gonna work

00:57:33
<transcript>: He's gonna work.

00:57:35
juniornascm: dont have a easy way* wihtout*

00:57:36
<transcript>: Oh.

00:57:38
thetonykano: The thing that will make it quite as possible for a keyboard is the switches on the keyboard that is being used.

00:57:39
<transcript>: Let's see. Vd.

00:57:41
devagrawal09: typescript doesn't quite narrow down an object type if you check it's properties

00:57:46
<transcript>: Types of visual domain or incompatible between these tops type NFL is not a soundable type MBA what, what.

00:57:51
<transcript>: Type NFL Box Score gamer interface.

00:57:51
<transcript>: nonsenble

00:57:55
<transcript>: Nonsenble type gamer mba Box score I'm aware.

00:58:00
<transcript>: But but by saying that the domain is MBA.

00:58:01
neochromer: yo yo

00:58:02
<transcript>: Not.

00:58:02
sockthedev: do all of the types have a literal domain name?

00:58:03
neochromer: what is SST ?

00:58:07
<transcript>: Oh typescript. Doesn't quite narrow down an object type if you check its property.

00:58:09
sockthedev: if any of them are of type string

00:58:11
<transcript>: Bummer. I just like, that would be magic. And it would work.

00:58:14
trivenge: two questions before i lurk and get some stuff done, it's ok to hate me for asking lol.   1. have you considered putting out applications to hire an upcoming or current industry video editor to create content on tiktok and youtube for you?  In that regard, I don't mind looking at portfolios and conversations to get an idea if someone would be a viable individual for your own brand.

00:58:18
sockthedev: it does narrow for me normally

00:58:25
<transcript>: Keyboards. Welcome to Chat porky. Yeper. Don't you just have to pass it as Const to make it not a string.

00:58:27
<transcript>: Is that right.

00:58:31
<transcript>: So you're saying if I go let's see go in here.

00:58:32
structuredchris: whattttt

00:58:38
<transcript>: And you're saying, like, mba ads.

00:58:40
<transcript>: Is that a thing I can do.

00:58:40
<transcript>: no

00:58:42
<transcript>: No, that's not it.

00:58:42
<transcript>: that's not it

00:58:43
<transcript>: That's not it.

00:58:45
<transcript>: What is it not like about that.

00:58:47
porkyyepper: I can't see your screen

00:58:51
<transcript>: As Const to make it not a string, but this specific string.

00:58:52
trivenge: 2. if i am still in the beginning stages of vanilla js, and am doing the odin project currently but am not fully ready to do complex work anyways, if i were to create open source projects on github but are unable to complete them, would that harm me when i go to apply for future dev positions?

00:58:56
<transcript>: So domain.

00:59:01
<transcript>: What it really is is as gamera domain.

00:59:06
<transcript>: But no, I mean like that's what I'm hoping to constrain domain to.

00:59:06
<transcript>: but

00:59:09
<transcript>: But this just doesn't work, does it.

00:59:12
<transcript>: This just doesn't work.

00:59:12
trivenge: or would that benefit me? if it would benefit me, how could i leverage that? sorry if this is a nuance question

00:59:20
<transcript>: Typesuit doesn't narrow down Yo Yo neocromer what's going on? Neocromer do all the types have a literal domain name.

00:59:24
<transcript>: If any of them are of type string no, none of them are stream. They'll always.

00:59:24
<transcript>: they'll

00:59:29
<transcript>: They'll always need to be one of the gamera domain values mba, NFL.

00:59:29
<transcript>: so

00:59:34
<transcript>: So if this won't work, am I just gonna have to cast? I really didn't want to cast.

00:59:37
<transcript>: If I have to, then I can.

00:59:41
<transcript>: Gonna have to cast.

00:59:42
sockthedev: but you have 4 types in the union

00:59:45
<transcript>: Data as mba Box for data.

00:59:48
shxtfxrd: could you use an enums for those?

00:59:49
sockthedev: and you only updated 2 types

00:59:50
structuredchris: In NbaVisual and NFLVisual, the domain needs to be of a union all the game names. at the moment its specific?

00:59:50
<transcript>: What is? Sst.

00:59:52
<transcript>: It is.

00:59:52
<transcript>: there's

00:59:54
adamdotdev: !sst

00:59:54
fossabot: SST is the best way to create modern applications on AWS, and Dax (@thdxr) is a co-founder there. https://sst.dev

00:59:55
structuredchris: that might be wrong but feels right

00:59:57
<transcript>: There's a command for it. Actually, someone asked that ss T.

01:00:01
<transcript>: So ssd is like an infrastructure's code framework.

01:00:01
<transcript>: deploys your

01:00:03
<transcript>: Deploys your stuff to AWS.

01:00:08
<transcript>: Two questions for I alert and get some stuff done. It's okay to hate me for asking.

01:00:08
<transcript>: if you consider putting

01:00:14
devagrawal09: if you can do data.domain === "NBA" it should be able to narrow it down

01:00:15
<transcript>: If you consider putting out applications to hire an upcoming or current industry video editor to create content on TikTok and YouTube for you.

01:00:15
<transcript>: in that regard

01:00:22
porkyyepper: ^

01:00:24
<transcript>: In that regard, I don't mind looking at portfolios and conversations. Get an idea if someone would be a viable individual for your own brands. So you know what, triv? I have considered it. I've considered it. But then I think like.

01:00:24
<transcript>: is that just too lazy

01:00:25
<transcript>: Is that just too lazy.

01:00:25
<transcript>: like

01:00:28
devagrawal09: seems like it can't do with nested properties

01:00:31
trivenge: no

01:00:34
<transcript>: Like is that just too lazy to outsource what would be a very creative endeavor? Like if I started making actual content for TikTok. Like actually tried.

01:00:34
<transcript>: then it'd be really

01:00:42
<transcript>: Then it'd be really fun and creative. And if I hired someone else to do it, what is it even then if you hire someone to do your TikTok, I guess it's like just trying to get people.

01:00:42
<transcript>: to like

01:00:44
structuredchris: ignore my last suggestion pretty sure its wrong

01:00:45
<transcript>: To like, show up here on twitch with me and hang out.

01:00:45
<transcript>: so

01:00:45
trivenge: you should be at the helm of it, the single most limiting thing you do is not hiring someone if you can afford it

01:00:54
<transcript>: So in that sense, I guess it would have a purpose, but it just feels like, I don't know. I'd be missing out on a fun, creative thing to get into. That's my problem with it.

01:00:56
trivenge: most youtubers grow above 1m+ subs generally because they hire someone

01:00:59
<transcript>: Youtube though I guess I get the YouTube case.

01:01:13
kryotoboi: If it were upto me I'd outsource even breathing.  My lungs get tired from all that breathing

01:01:15
<transcript>: Tired. Upcoming your current industry. Video editor. Yeah. An editor. Hiring an editor for YouTube would be fantastic, actually, because I know that's such a long game of learning that I would be fine shortcutting that so. Yeah, yeah, that sounds awesome. Trif.

01:01:18
<transcript>: Does narrow for me normally.

01:01:22
<transcript>: Can't see my screen. Oh, you can't see it.

01:01:22
<transcript>: can you see it porky

01:01:23
<transcript>: Can you see it? Porky.

01:01:30
porkyyepper: Yea

01:01:38
<transcript>: If I am still in the beginning stages of an ljs and I'm doing the odin project currently, but I'm not fully ready to do complex work anyways. If I were to create open source project on github but are unable to complete them, would that harm me when I go to apply for future deposits now? I don't think so.

01:01:42
<transcript>: That's not gonna harm you having any incomplete project.

01:01:42
<transcript>: i mean all

01:01:44
<transcript>: I mean all projects are incomplete.

01:01:52
<transcript>: When is a project ever complete? I think that'd be good. I need benefit. I think more activity, more work out in the open is better.

01:01:52
<transcript>: how could i

01:02:01
<transcript>: How could I leverage it just by having like activity in your GitHub, there are certain people who will be drawn to that like some people who hire really want to see a lot of activity in GitHub.

01:02:01
<transcript>: like that you're

01:02:05
trivenge: gotcha

01:02:10
<transcript>: Like that you're doing stuff out in the opening. And that's enough of a signal. So I think it's worth doing. You have four types in the Union. Could you use an enums for the.

01:02:16
<transcript>: Only update two types. That's true. I didn't do all of them yet. Maybe I should do all of them. And then we'll see.

01:02:22
structuredchris: enum ew gross

01:02:27
<transcript>: You see Ena with that fix my problem structured Chris, an NBA Visual and NFL Visual the domain needs to be of a Union of all the game names at the moment.

01:02:27
<transcript>: at that moment

01:02:35
structuredchris: NAHH thats wrong i think

01:02:40
<transcript>: At that moment, it's specific. Yeah, right inside India, visual. It's specific. It's only gonna be mba. And that's how I can do when the data comes from the server. If the value there is NBA, I know what shape this thing needs to be, and I know what to render.

01:02:43
<transcript>: So that makes sense.

01:02:43
structuredchris: yeah ignore that suggestion

01:02:51
<transcript>: So in NBA, Visual and NFL, the domain needs to be of a Union of all the game names.

01:02:59
<transcript>: I might be wrong but feels right if you can do data domain equals MBA it should be able to narrow it down.

01:02:59
<transcript>: data

01:02:59
<transcript>: Data.

01:02:59
<transcript>: domain

01:03:03
<transcript>: Domain. Oh, I think it is.

01:03:03
<transcript>: no

01:03:05
<transcript>: No. Does it not exist on that level.

01:03:07
<transcript>: Data.

01:03:10
<transcript>: Dot. No, it doesn't exist at that level.

01:03:14
sockthedev: visual needs to be the union, with domain being the discriminator

01:03:16
<transcript>: That's right. It's wouldn't. They can't do it with nested properties. I remember this from something else.

01:03:18
<transcript>: Oh, no worries? Structured.

01:03:18
<transcript>: you should

01:03:20
trivenge: thanks for the chat SeemsGood hopefully you consider hiring someone down the road. it sounds lazy, but you would be at the helm of the creativity anyways. when you find the right person, you are gonna be set  SeemsGood have a good one adam and friends.

01:03:22
trivenge: !lurk

01:03:30
<transcript>: You should be at the helm of it. The single most limiting thing you can do is not hiring someone if you can afford it, most youtubers go above 1 million subs generally because they hire someone. Yeah. Want to hire someone? I'm with you, triv. I can afford it. I'm gonna hire someone.

01:03:35
<transcript>: Crying.

01:03:35
<transcript>: get

01:03:37
<transcript>: Get died from the breathing.

01:03:42
<transcript>: Enemy. Gross. Now that's wrong. I think ignore that. Just okay. No. You're gonna.

01:03:42
<transcript>: visual needs to

01:03:46
<transcript>: Visual needs to be the Union with domain being the discriminator.

01:03:46
<transcript>: visual

01:03:48
<transcript>: Visual needs to be the Union.

01:03:52
<transcript>: My brain is so slow.

01:04:01
<transcript>: Thanks for the chat. Hopefully you consider hiding someone down the road. Sounds lazy, but you'll be at the helm of the creativity anyways, when you find the right person gonna be set. Yeah, triv, you can help me find that person. That would be fantastic.

01:04:01
<transcript>: we'll see

01:04:03
porkyyepper: I would do something like this and let VisualDomainType accept a generic:   type VisualDomainType = "NBA" | "NFL" interface Visual<VisualType extends VisualDomainType> {   domain: VisualDomainType,   scoreboard: keyof typeof ScoreBoards[VisualType], }  const ScoreBoards = {   "NBA": NBAScoreBoard   "NFL": NFLScoreBoard }

01:04:04
<transcript>: We'll see you trifle? A.

01:04:04
devagrawal09: can you not define a data.domain property instead of data.visual.domain

01:04:11
<transcript>: Domain. Okay. I would do something like this and let visual domain type, except generic type.

01:04:11
<transcript>: so vis

01:04:17
<transcript>: So Visual domain type interface Visual and the Visual type Extend Visual domain type domain.

01:04:17
<transcript>: score

01:04:18
stiefbroerikzitvast: hire me :)

01:04:20
<transcript>: Scoreboard key of typescore's. Visual type oh, I see.

01:04:26
<transcript>: Can you not define a data domain property instead of data visual domain? So.

01:04:26
<transcript>: i actually dev

01:04:29
<transcript>: I actually dev. I don't control the shape. It's like in a different.

01:04:29
<transcript>: project it's like an

01:04:32
kiwifromearth: kiwimind

01:04:32
<transcript>: Project. It's like an external system. Right.

01:04:39
<transcript>: Database visual domain, so I can't I mean, I guess I could like.

01:04:41
<transcript>: To set it.

01:04:48
<transcript>: I could just set it. Can I do that? Can I put the property on the interface and then just.

01:04:54
<transcript>: Like encode, set the value to the other value and then it would work.

01:05:00
<transcript>: Maybe that would work.

01:05:00
<transcript>: let's go back

01:05:02
<transcript>: Let's go back into our type.

01:05:04
<transcript>: So here.

01:05:07
devagrawal09: sure but then that code will not be typesafe

01:05:08
<transcript>: The top level is what.

01:05:08
<transcript>: top level

01:05:17
<transcript>: Top Level this data type is what gamera NBA box for in the fo box for MLB Box or NHL Box score.

01:05:23
<transcript>: And we just cast that in here, right.

01:05:27
<transcript>: As response? T Yeah.

01:05:27
<transcript>: so gamer mb

01:05:30
<transcript>: So gamer mba Box Score NFL Box for.

01:05:36
<transcript>: What if I do this? Wait a minute.

01:05:38
<transcript>: Wait a minute.

01:05:38
<transcript>: because this

01:05:40
devagrawal09: yeah so define that additional property into those BoxScore interfaces (if possible)

01:05:45
<transcript>: Because this is aware of the domain. So what if I just do this? What if I just said instead of this, like this, check.

01:05:47
<transcript>: What if I did a type of.

01:05:51
<transcript>: Can I just do this.

01:05:54
<transcript>: Kind of.

01:05:57
<transcript>: Data.

01:05:57
<transcript>: type of

01:06:00
<transcript>: Type of type of data how does that work.

01:06:07
<transcript>: Type of data. Is this only like a typescript thing and it won't work at runtime.

01:06:15
<transcript>: Can I do this? Someone tell me if this is gonna be possible. Can I just do a type check here.

01:06:23
<transcript>: But then that code will not be type safe.

01:06:23
devagrawal09: yeah this won't work at runtime unless you are using classes and making instances of it

01:06:30
<transcript>: Yeah, I got you. No, we're not doing that.

01:06:35
<transcript>: We need to just be data domain at the top.

01:06:39
<transcript>: Okay. So we just said it. Yeah. I see what we're saying.

01:06:43
<transcript>: So we just said it. Let's see.

01:06:45
<transcript>: Here.

01:06:45
<transcript>: and we

01:06:47
<transcript>: And we say.

01:06:51
<transcript>: Data. So it'll be right here. We'll say data.

01:06:51
<transcript>: domain

01:06:52
<transcript>: Domain.

01:06:52
<transcript>: equals

01:06:53
devagrawal09: ^typeof

01:06:54
<transcript>: Equals domain.

01:06:54
<transcript>: and

01:06:58
<transcript>: And then we need to define it in each of these right.

01:07:03
<transcript>: So here.

01:07:12
<transcript>: Visual so it extends gamera box for base. I guess I can add it right here. Domain is a.

01:07:17
<transcript>: Oh, this is where I have to do? Yeah.

01:07:17
<transcript>: domain

01:07:18
<transcript>: Domain.

01:07:20
<transcript>: Mba.

01:07:24
<transcript>: Right domain NFL.

01:07:27
<transcript>: Right.

01:07:32
<transcript>: That'll be at the top yard box for base. Yeah. Yeah. So then.

01:07:33
devagrawal09: yep

01:07:35
<transcript>: When I say Data domain.

01:07:37
<transcript>: Any what.

01:07:42
<transcript>: Is this in any.

01:07:45
<transcript>: Response T.

01:07:49
<transcript>: Oh, because I didn't add it to all of them.

01:07:49
devagrawal09: T is a generic

01:07:53
<transcript>: So we got to have.

01:07:57
<transcript>: Already have the stubbed out here. I just haven't made the visuals for them. Okay, cool.

01:08:02
<transcript>: So MLB and NHL. Okay.

01:08:02
<transcript>: now

01:08:05
devagrawal09: no you need to add it to the base type

01:08:08
<transcript>: Now, does it work? Can I find domain? Oh, is it not compliment a prop domain.

01:08:12
<transcript>: Right.

01:08:16
<transcript>: Domain? Extends camera domain? Yeah, Yeah.

01:08:16
<transcript>: and

01:08:18
<transcript>: And domain here.

01:08:18
<transcript>: okay

01:08:19
devagrawal09: i guess that works

01:08:24
<transcript>: Okay. So I did that now when I go back to the game thing if data domain.

01:08:30
<transcript>: Equals mba. We know it's an mba box for right.

01:08:31
<transcript>: It works.

01:08:34
<transcript>: Need to add to the base type.

01:08:36
<transcript>: Did I need to.

01:08:39
devagrawal09: let's gooooo

01:08:39
<transcript>: Is this better or worse? Dev.

01:08:41
<transcript>: device let's

01:08:43
<transcript>: Device. Let's go. It works.

01:08:43
<transcript>: is this better

01:08:46
thetonykano: I learned enough html/css/javascript to make my own website more of a portfolio website that runs off of a Raspberry Pi

01:08:48
<transcript>: Is this better or worse than adding it to the base type? Because I can still do that instead if we think that's better.

01:08:50
structuredchris: wait soo what changed lol

01:08:56
mecoupz: Hey 👋

01:08:57
structuredchris: i zoned out how does this work now

01:09:01
devagrawal09: this works, that was my bad I didn;t realize the generic was extending the union and not the base type

01:09:02
beeut: is it American football? don't know anything about US sport :D

01:09:08
<transcript>: I learned enough HTML css, JavaScript to make my own website more before fully website that runs off of a raspberry pi. I love playing with raspberry pies. I would say like I was a dev for a long time before I played with hardware like that. Think of it. Follow. I am Walton.

01:09:08
<transcript>: i

01:09:19
<transcript>: I was a Dev for probably like ten years. I've been professionally programming before I got a Raspberry python played with it. I think every Dev should play with a raspberry pi. The amount of like.

01:09:19
<transcript>: light bu

01:09:26
<transcript>: Light bulbs that went off. And just like this is so cool. How many things could I do with this? It was one of those moments that I'll never forget in my career.

01:09:26
<transcript>: where

01:09:27
<transcript>: Where.

01:09:35
<transcript>: Before that moment, I was just so unaware of, like all the possibilities of doing things in the physical world with technology.

01:09:35
<transcript>: and that

01:09:37
<transcript>: And that just like.

01:09:45
<transcript>: Open eyes, all kinds of fun. It's just it was a really fun hobby to have for a bit. I was into it pretty hard for a bit. And then.

01:09:45
<transcript>: just

01:09:47
<transcript>: Just stopped but.

01:09:51
<transcript>: Maybe I didn't roast it. Generic was extending the Union, not the base. I cool. Okay.

01:09:51
<transcript>: so

01:09:54
locrizak: worse, you should make a const for the NBS, NHL etc, make a type as "Domains" which is of type "typeof NBA | typeof NHL | ...etc" and then you can add domain: Domain in te base type

01:09:56
<transcript>: So Dev this works. We did it. We Typed script, it typescripted, it.

01:10:07
devagrawal09: @structuredchris you can do this check with direct properties and typescript can narrow down the type, but you cannot do it with nested properties, so typescript cannot narrow with data.visual.domain but it can with data.domain

01:10:09
<transcript>: Low crease act. Look rescue. Welcome to chat. Worse. You should make a Const for the MBS inhale etc and make a type as domains which is of type type of mba, type of NHL etc.

01:10:09
<transcript>: and

01:10:14
<transcript>: And then you can add domain domain in the base type OOH.

01:10:14
<transcript>: is

01:10:23
<transcript>: Is that that's what oh you're saying what I did is worse. I should make a Const for the thing. Type as domains.

01:10:23
<transcript>: type of

01:10:25
<transcript>: Type of innate.

01:10:25
<transcript>: i'm not

01:10:28
<transcript>: I'm not following all of it. I believe you that it's better.

01:10:37
<transcript>: Well, you can do this. Check with direct properties and typescript Canara down the type, but you cannot do it with nested properties. Okay. So for these, I'm just gonna do.

01:10:41
<transcript>: So I feel.

01:10:41
<transcript>: actually

01:10:45
<transcript>: Actually come in a future typescript version right where you can do it mess the properties.

01:10:47
<transcript>: Maybe that's like set a limit.

01:10:52
<transcript>: Like how many nets did it can go or something? I don't know.

01:10:57
devagrawal09: here's a tsplay that demonstrates this https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/C4TwDgpgBAShDOBXANsKBeKBvKATAhsPgFxQB2iAtgEYQBOANFPEcIvKQERIDGPC8TgF8oAH2xR6dAPZ1S+MiCYtC7LlNnCA3AFgAUPp7SyLKMATAAjBmwj88WAhTBdBvQEsAZgApzLSwB0KmwO6GFQ3Ih8ApwAlNj6UElQRiZoAG42flYBBERayQD0hcwAFtIouFC05FS0dPpC+vqgkI5IqABMNjh5JLU09MqsahKt0Fy8-PCCQiLiOBpyUApKzCMcWOPqdDJ0wkKuhsam2d2YWHYOcB3AnUcePmdBGwHjGOGR0TNxCXrJKROGSyFk6uUI+AKSWKZQqyCqNQogwaeiaeiAA

01:11:07
jeanelemesmo: !sst

01:11:07
<transcript>: So now it's type errors because not the right type of box for needs to be NFL box score. This one needs to be MLB box Four, which I haven't created.

01:11:07
devagrawal09: whoops long url

01:11:07
fossabot: SST is the best way to create modern applications on AWS, and Dax (@thdxr) is a co-founder there. https://sst.dev

01:11:17
<transcript>: And this one needs to be NHL box score also have not created let's just get NFL working and then we'll come back. This is cool. This is feeling pretty cool.

01:11:19
<transcript>: Right.

01:11:27
<transcript>: The record type thing. Should I have done that? Did anybody want to see me do a record type instead of this approach.

01:11:32
<transcript>: Would that be better, actually, because then we're kind of like not rendering more than one ever.

01:11:32
<transcript>: if we had

01:11:37
<transcript>: If we had like a comps welcome to Chat G.

01:11:42
<transcript>: Here's a ts play that demonstrates this. Do I need to Cook on that dev? Or was that for somebody else.

01:11:42
<transcript>: that's

01:11:45
<transcript>: That's alright. I don't care about the long hero. That's fine.

01:11:45
<transcript>: but if

01:11:52
<transcript>: But if I need to click on it, I will if I don't, I'm gonna keep going. So Const map I don't know what to call it.

01:11:55
devagrawal09: you don't have to

01:11:59
<transcript>: We're just gonna map oh, look at that. It did something copilot. We're gonna map NBA to.

01:12:05
<transcript>: Guess what would I be doing here.

01:12:05
<transcript>: am i doing

01:12:06
<transcript>: Am I doing like.

01:12:11
devagrawal09: you fixed it already

01:12:13
<transcript>: No the component type. Maybe NBA box score.

01:12:17
<transcript>: Component.

01:12:17
<transcript>: like

01:12:19
<transcript>: Like some like this.

01:12:26
<transcript>: Nfl box or Man, I really want some real copy. What the what just happened.

01:12:26
<transcript>: in the fo

01:12:28
<transcript>: In the fo box.

01:12:38
mecoupz: Not so long on the stream, but Adam why do you have seperate components for each type? Is the design so different?

01:12:39
<transcript>: Component. And what is this type of right now? Mba.

01:12:39
<transcript>: i guess i need

01:12:42
<transcript>: I guess I need to type it as like a record.

01:12:44
<transcript>: Gamer domain.

01:12:50
<transcript>: And it has a what is what are these components? Oh, I could do the base type.

01:13:00
<transcript>: Like this.

01:13:08
vprvajrarpv: Aren't theyt any?

01:13:08
<transcript>: No a gamera box or just garbage word that's the Union type, right? It needs to be the Union type. Probably.

01:13:15
<transcript>: Why can't I move down there we go.

01:13:21
<transcript>: So that and then what's wrong with that? Oh, because it's not.

01:13:28
<transcript>: Record.

01:13:28
<transcript>: what's wrong

01:13:30
<transcript>: What's wrong.

01:13:30
<transcript>: not a

01:13:36
<transcript>: Not a type signal. Oh, no, because it's not doing that. It's not the tight. It's the component.

01:13:45
vprvajrarpv: They are any

01:13:45
<transcript>: What what is the type of this component? I don't know what the type of an Astro component is. Is it like Astro component.

01:13:54
<transcript>: How do I know that? What is the type HTML element? I don't know.

01:13:56
cowfacedude99: try infer

01:14:04
<transcript>: So trying to explore this if I could do this with a record type and make this a little tidier.

01:14:05
<transcript>: There any.

01:14:05
<transcript>: try inf

01:14:07
<transcript>: Try infer.

01:14:11
<transcript>: Vpr. Welcome to chat.

01:14:11
<transcript>: there any

01:14:12
<transcript>: There any.

01:14:12
<transcript>: so

01:14:18
<transcript>: So what? But I need, I need it to be a component that can take props, specific. Props.

01:14:21
<transcript>: Just like these. Can you know what I'm saying.

01:14:21
<transcript>: you're saying try

01:14:25
<transcript>: You're saying try and fur. So like infer.

01:14:25
<transcript>: to do that

01:14:26
<transcript>: To do that.

01:14:26
<transcript>: i think

01:14:29
<transcript>: I think for the follow messy beats.

01:14:34
<transcript>: I want to apologize to everybody for today's stream. I'm gonna be a little.

01:14:34
<transcript>: i'm a little

01:14:35
<transcript>: I'm a little.

01:14:35
<transcript>: slow

01:14:37
<transcript>: Slow.

01:14:37
<transcript>: my throat

01:14:39
<transcript>: My throat is a little sore and raw.

01:14:39
<transcript>: and

01:14:42
cowfacedude99: https://blog.logrocket.com/understanding-infer-typescript/

01:14:46
<transcript>: And my eyes are a little I think I think these are allergies I think what I'm describing is I have allergies.

01:14:48
<transcript>: I think I'm just figuring it out.

01:14:52
trivenge: lkol

01:14:53
<transcript>: Understanding infer typescript. Let's check let's take a look at this.

01:14:56
trivenge: LUL

01:15:00
sockthedev: lets go back to building tabs

01:15:06
rsromano: Is it (props) => any? That seems like a generic functional component

01:15:11
devagrawal09: oof infer is a whole rabbit hole

01:15:11
<transcript>: So if you came here expecting a good show, this is like this is like, you know, some musician on tour sometimes just aren't the best. This is gonna be maybe not the best stream, but maybe maybe those are the good ones. They're kind of more intimate. I'm a little more vulnerable with you all. I don't know. I'm just making this up.

01:15:13
structuredchris: @devagrawal09 huh i dont think ive ever ran into this lol maybe im following a practice where this doesn't occur but idk. so the problem is that by enforcing a nested property this doesn't enforce type of the parent object?  isn't that why you do this? function isFish(pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Fish {   return (pet as Fish).swim !== undefined; }

01:15:15
<transcript>: Let's go back to the building tabs.

01:15:18
<transcript>: It's funny.

01:15:23
<transcript>: Is it props? Any that seemed like a generic functional component. Oh, oh, maybe it is props, any.

01:15:26
<transcript>: Infer is a whole rabbit hole.

01:15:26
<transcript>: oh boy

01:15:27
<transcript>: Oh boy.

01:15:32
<transcript>: Can I infer the type of.

01:15:32
<transcript>: a component

01:15:34
<transcript>: A component in Astro.

01:15:34
<transcript>: i don't

01:15:39
<transcript>: I don't think I can do this. I don't think I'm smart enough.

01:15:39
<transcript>: return

01:15:41
<transcript>: Return type.

01:15:50
<transcript>: So you're saying I might be able to do like return type and then generic put the type of a component in there. Let's just try. I mean Kenner to try.

01:15:54
<transcript>: What could happen? What's the worst it can happen? Return type.

01:15:58
<transcript>: Mba Box score.

01:16:02
<transcript>: I need to like.

01:16:05
andom: Heellou HeyGuys

01:16:07
<transcript>: Oh, use this value. I don't think I can do this.

01:16:12
<transcript>: Okay. So let's say it is just a function that returns in any.

01:16:14
<transcript>: With that.

01:16:19
<transcript>: Not tired? Oh, because I. Yeah, this should not be this.

01:16:19
<transcript>: this

01:16:25
<transcript>: This should be a function that returns in any I don't know for now and then we need to narrow the.

01:16:25
<transcript>: function

01:16:30
<transcript>: Function type the function parameters. What's wrong here.

01:16:39
<transcript>: Component this is the following properties. It's missing. Mlb, NHL, and npga.

01:16:39
<transcript>: got to do these

01:16:40
<transcript>: Got to do these.

01:16:52
locrizak: instead of the "() => any" it can be React.ReactNode

01:16:57
gabrielmodog: and if you put reactnode on the record infer

01:17:00
<transcript>: And then PGA. Speaking of PGA, the Masters is coming the only time of the year. I care about golf. Any only referral. What am I doing? I can't.

01:17:05
<transcript>: Not this.

01:17:11
devagrawal09: @structuredchris yes that is a non-typesafe way of doing that check, since you have the `as`

01:17:13
<transcript>: Oh, oh, I wouldn't do this here. I would do, like, actually do mba boxor. Right. Of course.

01:17:17
<transcript>: Nfl bar.

01:17:22
<transcript>: Nfl Box, or MLB Box, score.

01:17:28
<transcript>: And hl box score. These don't even exist yet that's gonna be a problem. Oh.

01:17:30
<transcript>: I'm just slow today.

01:17:30
<transcript>: i'm just

01:17:31
devagrawal09: so you're working around typescript instead of working with

01:17:33
<transcript>: I'm just. I'm just a little slow.

01:17:33
<transcript>: i need to

01:17:34
structuredchris: @devagrawal09 is* ?

01:17:36
<transcript>: I need to, like, stub these other ones out, or it's gonna be a problem for me.

01:17:36
<transcript>: and

01:17:40
<transcript>: And then this one needs to be like.

01:17:40
<transcript>: nothing

01:17:41
<transcript>: Nothing.

01:17:41
<transcript>: never

01:17:44
<transcript>: Never what can I do here.

01:17:47
<transcript>: No.

01:17:47
<transcript>: something like that

01:17:53
<transcript>: Something like that. Let's define MLB and PGA. Oh, no.

01:17:56
devagrawal09: both is and as contribute to it

01:17:56
<transcript>: What am I doing.

01:18:03
<transcript>: There we go. I don't know. I need to make let's just do this.

01:18:06
<transcript>: That's not where I want to go. Why'd you take me there.

01:18:06
<transcript>: it's all

01:18:09
devagrawal09: `as` more so

01:18:09
<transcript>: It's all box. Oh, that is that. Yeah.

01:18:09
<transcript>: i need to

01:18:10
structuredchris: oh, so I shouldn't be using typeguards? like that example

01:18:12
<transcript>: I need to make NBA box for or no, I'm sorry.

01:18:15
<transcript>: Need to make NHL.

01:18:19
<transcript>: To MLB Box Score Astro.

01:18:22
kratoze: nba bosco

01:18:23
<transcript>: And I need to make NHL.

01:18:23
<transcript>: box

01:18:23
structuredchris: sounds as bad as using 'any'

01:18:26
<transcript>: Box score Astro.

01:18:31
devagrawal09: correct

01:18:32
<transcript>: I don't think I've ever been into this. Maybe I'm following practice.

01:18:38
devagrawal09: this solution does not use any

01:18:41
<transcript>: It doesn't occur. Okay, you guys talk about some and Thomas here instead of the yep, yep, yep. Can be React React node. Oh, we're not actually using react.

01:18:41
<transcript>: low

01:18:51
gabrielmodog: Yeah I got know lol sorry

01:18:55
<transcript>: Lowpre. This is actually astro. It looks a lot like jsx, but it's actually an astrophile. And if you put react node on the record infer okay, that is a non type of so you're working around typescriptions that we're working with.

01:18:55
<transcript>: both

01:18:57
<transcript>: Both is.

01:18:57
<transcript>: and as

01:18:59
<transcript>: And as contribute to it.

01:19:01
structuredchris: k, think ive only got like 2 typeguards shouldn't be hard to solve

01:19:05
<transcript>: Oh, so I shouldn't be using typeguards like that example. Okay. I'm just trying to catch up here.

01:19:08
<transcript>: Nba Box, Go, Box, go.

01:19:19
<transcript>: So I'm creating MLB and MBA.

01:19:19
<transcript>: sorry

01:19:21
<transcript>: Sorry. Nhl.

01:19:30
<transcript>: We're gonna just paste these into here. These aren't correct yet, but I don't care. That's not the point. The point is just to have something.

01:19:36
<transcript>: To type this thing out properly.

01:19:41
<transcript>: So that's our NHL.

01:19:44
<transcript>: In our MLB.

01:19:47
<transcript>: Now let's go to our.

01:19:50
<transcript>: Types or maybe back to the here.

01:19:53
<transcript>: Go ahead and add these. Oh, come on.

01:19:59
<transcript>: Kind of add those. I'm made them. I made them.

01:20:07
<transcript>: Hl.

01:20:10
<transcript>: hlbach

01:20:10
<transcript>: hlbach or

01:20:12
<transcript>: Hlbach or Yep.

01:20:20
<transcript>: I can just change. Oh, I just changed the F to an H. It works. Okay, so we got an inside. We got all those.

01:20:23
<transcript>: Types.

01:20:23
<transcript>: they

01:20:25
<transcript>: They expect props.

01:20:30
<transcript>: Props? I don't know. Actually.

01:20:30
<transcript>: okay

01:20:35
<transcript>: Okay, so we need to actually put some props in here. What type of props do they expect.

01:20:37
<transcript>: Well.

01:20:43
<transcript>: The props that they expect are a dataprop with a box score in it. Okay.

01:20:45
<transcript>: So.

01:20:49
<transcript>: Data.

01:20:49
<transcript>: oh no i guess

01:20:51
<transcript>: Oh, no, I guess it's an object.

01:20:53
<transcript>: Props.

01:20:53
<transcript>: data

01:20:54
<transcript>: Data.

01:20:59
devagrawal09: your example was more of a type assertion than a type guard

01:20:59
<transcript>: Which is a box score.

01:21:02
<transcript>: Hey.

01:21:05
<transcript>: No.

01:21:05
<transcript>: wrong

01:21:06
<transcript>: Wrong.

01:21:11
structuredchris: @devagrawal09 o

01:21:12
<transcript>: Oh, I didn't because I didn't finish the sentence.

01:21:12
<transcript>: i

01:21:13
<transcript>: I.

01:21:17
<transcript>: Crops? What did I do here.

01:21:17
<transcript>: that's

01:21:19
<transcript>: That's the props, ties.

01:21:19
<transcript>: and

01:21:22
<transcript>: And it turns into an any.

01:21:27
<transcript>: Oh, okay. Maybe some good information here.

01:21:27
<transcript>: type props

01:21:32
<transcript>: Type props to any is not assignable to type props to data, gamerbox score, or any.

01:21:32
<transcript>: but

01:21:33
<transcript>: But.

01:21:36
<transcript>: Type of parameters. Props and props are incompatible.

01:21:38
<transcript>: What.

01:21:38
<transcript>: i don't understand

01:21:39
<transcript>: I don't understand.

01:21:53
<transcript>: Banana panini. Thanks, osha. Followed. That sounds delicious. A banana panini.

01:21:53
<transcript>: sounds

01:21:54
<transcript>: Sounds excellent.

01:22:03
<transcript>: We eat a lot of bananas around here. We're plant based type gamer box Where's not a signal type gamer NBA box or oh, it's giving me a hint here.

01:22:04
structuredchris: anyway, thanks though. now i know to never touch them again. thanks for that playground example as well! learnt from it! :)

01:22:05
<transcript>: So I guess.

01:22:05
<transcript>: we need to make

01:22:07
<transcript>: We need to make these.

01:22:09
<transcript>: It's almost like.

01:22:14
porkyyepper: I'm like 90% sure you'll have to use genrics to specify which boxscore you want

01:22:16
<transcript>: This is like generic. It's like this type should depend on.

01:22:16
<transcript>: the game

01:22:17
<transcript>: The gamera.

01:22:22
<transcript>: So I need to do this. Why am I even doing this? Do we want the record thing.

01:22:22
<transcript>: this is even clean

01:22:24
bausmeier: Do you need to specify the type here? Can you not add an `as const` after the object and remove the `: Record<...>`?

01:22:27
<transcript>: This is even clean things up. I think it cleans up the markup a little bit. But is it worth this.

01:22:33
<transcript>: Do you need to specify the type here? Can you not add in as concepts the object and remove the record.

01:22:33
<transcript>: oh

01:22:35
<transcript>: Oh Oh.

01:22:39
<transcript>: That sounds amazing.

01:22:46
<transcript>: Sounds amazing.

01:22:48
<transcript>: As Const.

01:22:49
<transcript>: constant

01:22:50
<transcript>: Constant.

01:22:50
<transcript>: me

01:22:51
<transcript>: Me.

01:22:51
<transcript>: does that

01:23:00
<transcript>: Does that just work? Props, any. Well, will we lose a strong typing that we just worked so hard for? So it's down here. I just say component.

01:23:02
<transcript>: Data.

01:23:07
<transcript>: It's not a valid component.

01:23:07
<transcript>: we mean

01:23:08
<transcript>: We mean.

01:23:08
<transcript>: look

01:23:10
<transcript>: Look, those are components.

01:23:15
<transcript>: I need to type these.

01:23:19
<transcript>: Oh, it's like asher. Does it know the type of these.

01:23:20
structuredchris: you aren't indexing component

01:23:23
w3barsi: how many calories in that  larabar?

01:23:23
structuredchris: ?

01:23:24
<transcript>: It's like this is something I could search in the astro docs.

01:23:24
<transcript>: ice script

01:23:25
<transcript>: Ice, script.

01:23:28
<transcript>: Intellisense.

01:23:28
<transcript>: setting

01:23:30
<transcript>: Setting up.

01:23:40
bausmeier: `Component[domain]`?

01:23:40
<transcript>: What are the type of the components.

01:23:40
<transcript>: is

01:23:42
<transcript>: Is the question.

01:23:42
<transcript>: you are

01:23:44
<transcript>: You aren't indexing component.

01:23:47
devagrawal09: `Component` is not a real component, `Component.NBA` is the component

01:23:53
devagrawal09: @bausmeier ^

01:23:53
structuredchris: you just turned an object into a < />

01:23:55
<transcript>: Like 90%. Sure. You'll have to use generics to specify which box where you want. I think you could be right at porky.

01:24:00
<transcript>: Component is not a real component component. Mba is the component.

01:24:00
<transcript>: oh

01:24:02
<transcript>: Oh Oh.

01:24:04
<transcript>: So this wouldn't actually.

01:24:04
<transcript>: save us

01:24:07
<transcript>: Save us anything because I'd have to say.

01:24:11
<transcript>: Mba.

01:24:20
<transcript>: And then the type isn't good.

01:24:24
<transcript>: Right. Oh, I'm just like, index component.

01:24:24
<transcript>: with

01:24:26
<transcript>: With the League.

01:24:29
<transcript>: So it'd be like this.

01:24:35
<transcript>: But it would be Can you do that.

01:24:39
<transcript>: You do that.

01:24:42
<transcript>: 's not valid.

01:24:42
<transcript>: you know i'm saying

01:24:46
<transcript>: You know, I'm saying, like, what I want to do is like, I want to say, domain.

01:24:49
<transcript>: Own it domain.

01:24:55
<transcript>: Is this worth doing? Should I just forget this and just stick with what I'm doing here? I'm just sticking one on this is we're getting too far.

01:24:58
<transcript>: This is not worth it.

01:24:58
<transcript>: we

01:25:02
<transcript>: We had a nice, elegant solution. Right here.

01:25:02
<transcript>: and then

01:25:06
<transcript>: And then I just started trying to make it hard? There we go. I.

01:25:06
<transcript>: so what

01:25:09
devagrawal09: yeah but techincally you have to do something like that, use the index to grab the component and then render that

01:25:10
<transcript>: So what we need to do now is fix these types.

01:25:12
devagrawal09: this is fine

01:25:22
devagrawal09: you could put this in a switch

01:25:25
<transcript>: This is fine. It's fine. Technically, you do. You have to do something like that. Use the index, grab the component, and then render that. Yeah, Yeah.

01:25:28
<transcript>: I could put this on a switch.

01:25:28
<transcript>: would look better

01:25:36
<transcript>: Would look better because I don't like that. Is that this technically could render more than one somehow. I don't know how. But reggie's world things that follow.

01:25:38
<transcript>: Let's put it in a switch.

01:25:38
<transcript>: so you're

01:25:41
<transcript>: So you're saying I can put it in the switch.

01:25:43
<transcript>: I just have to say, what? Switch.

01:25:47
<transcript>: Data domain.

01:25:51
<transcript>: I can do this.

01:25:51
<transcript>: i believe you

01:25:52
<transcript>: I believe you.

01:25:52
<transcript>: then i would

01:25:53
devagrawal09: probably an IIFE

01:25:55
<transcript>: Then I would say, case.

01:25:55
porkyyepper: A cool approach could be an abstracted component that handles all the logic of selecting the correct Boxscore and from here you just pass it the domain.

01:25:57
<transcript>: Yeah like that.

01:26:01
<transcript>: But it doesn't like it.

01:26:08
<transcript>: Cool approach could be an abstracted component that handles all the logic of selecting the crock Buy score, and from here you just pass it the domain.

01:26:10
<transcript>: Yes.

01:26:11
structuredchris: return it

01:26:15
devagrawal09: {(function() { switch() {...} })()}

01:26:16
<transcript>: The only thing I guess like we're never using these box scores anywhere else.

01:26:16
sockthedev: you need a return in the case statement right?

01:26:20
<transcript>: So I don't know I guess I don't know why was.

01:26:20
<transcript>: i got to

01:26:21
sockthedev: no implicit return

01:26:22
porkyyepper: fair

01:26:24
<transcript>: I got to do the function that the Iffy's iffy if e thing.

01:26:27
<transcript>: So.

01:26:33
<transcript>: So let's see. Let's go back to here and let's say function.

01:26:37
<transcript>: And then after the switch.

01:26:37
<transcript>: i'm going to have

01:26:39
<transcript>: I'm going to have.

01:26:39
<transcript>: another

01:26:40
<transcript>: Another bracket.

01:26:43
<transcript>: And then another, Oh.

01:26:47
<transcript>: Wait another bracket.

01:26:47
<transcript>: friend

01:26:49
<transcript>: Friend call the phone.

01:26:52
<transcript>: Yes.

01:26:57
<transcript>: Does that work.

01:26:57
<transcript>: do i not need

01:27:04
<transcript>: Do I not need like any other controls, like flow statement, like a return or something just like that. Nfl.

01:27:07
<transcript>: And they'll be.

01:27:12
<transcript>: Hl I weirdly like this more even though it has the weird iffy thing.

01:27:17
<transcript>: And then default is like.

01:27:17
<transcript>: pro new error

01:27:17
bausmeier: You need a return.

01:27:18
<transcript>: Pro new error.

01:27:19
devagrawal09: case "NFL": return <Nfl />

01:27:20
structuredchris: yeee add return

01:27:29
<transcript>: Oh, it has to be return. Okay.

01:27:32
<transcript>: This domain.

01:27:35
<transcript>: I don't know something like that.

01:27:35
<transcript>: so

01:27:36
<transcript>: So.

01:27:36
<transcript>: return

01:27:38
<transcript>: Return.

01:27:45
devagrawal09: "error unknown domain"

01:27:46
<transcript>: So glad you guys are smart.

01:27:46
<transcript>: we have

01:27:49
bausmeier: An arrow function is slightly cleaner for IIFE.

01:27:51
<transcript>: We have some smart people in my chat. Thank you so much for being smart. I really appreciate it.

01:27:51
<transcript>: so now

01:27:56
<transcript>: So now we should get tapper. Yeah. Type errors. Yep. Nfl.

01:27:58
<transcript>: Mlb.

01:27:58
<transcript>: and

01:28:01
<transcript>: And NHL.

01:28:01
<transcript>: look at

01:28:02
<transcript>: Look at this.

01:28:02
<transcript>: did this

01:28:03
porkyyepper: Wouldn't you want a break?

01:28:04
<transcript>: Did this funky.

01:28:08
<transcript>: Iif E Switch statement.

01:28:08
<transcript>: oh what's wrong

01:28:11
<transcript>: Oh, what's wrong? Oh, let's fix those sides. That's fine.

01:28:20
<transcript>: I like it. I don't know. It's endearing. It's so ugly. It's cute. It's one of those, you know, like only a mother could love.

01:28:24
structuredchris: why does it need to be in a function?

01:28:28
<transcript>: Prettier hasn't gotten a whole of it yet, so maybe pretty early even make it better.

01:28:35
devagrawal09: show this to the "clean code" fanatics and watch them freak out

01:28:35
structuredchris: can't switch statements go in {}

01:28:37
<transcript>: I guess you just can't do a switch statement natively. Like you can't just like drop a switch statement in there. You should get a wrap it in one of those weird function things.

01:28:37
<transcript>: when you

01:28:39
<transcript>: When you want to break.

01:28:41
<transcript>: Over returning.

01:28:45
structuredchris: ohhh k fair, never use them ^^

01:28:47
<transcript>: So that is the statement that breaks the control flow right.

01:28:49
<transcript>: Okay.

01:28:52
<transcript>: Air unknown domain.

01:28:53
<transcript>: Oh, that's better.

01:28:56
<transcript>: Like another.

01:28:56
<transcript>: can't render

01:28:58
<transcript>: Can't render this domain.

01:29:02
<transcript>: Unknown domain.

01:29:08
<transcript>: I mean, it could be a known domain. I just don't support it like we can't do this for PGA. So if you try to render this thing.

01:29:08
<transcript>: for

01:29:13
<transcript>: For a PGA question. This is I guess what's gonna show up is whatever I say here.

01:29:15
devagrawal09: so unsupported domain

01:29:18
<transcript>: Oh data.

01:29:23
<transcript>: We're gonna put that in there. Now let's fix these types so that we can owe it.

01:29:23
<transcript>: domain

01:29:25
<transcript>: Domain.

01:29:31
<transcript>: I guess I'm gonna just do don't.

01:29:35
<transcript>: Have that available right here.

01:29:40
<transcript>: But that's assuming that the data is the same, it's not gonna be data.

01:29:40
<transcript>: so why don't we have

01:29:46
cowfacedude99: well, windows and nvm hates me :(

01:29:48
<transcript>: So why don't we have domain here? Because now data is a type. What a never. Oh yeah, because if it's PDF.

01:29:51
devagrawal09: ah right it's of type "never" so typescript doesn't even exist there to be a domain property

01:29:53
<transcript>: The only case here would be that it's a PGA. I'm just gonna say cannot.

01:29:56
<transcript>: Unknown domain.

01:29:56
<transcript>: or no

01:29:59
<transcript>: Or no, it's not an unknown. It's just.

01:29:59
<transcript>: cannot

01:30:03
<transcript>: Cannot render a box score for PGA.

01:30:08
<transcript>: And if we ever see that we'll know what's going on.

01:30:08
<transcript>: why

01:30:12
devagrawal09: json string print the entire data i guess LUL

01:30:14
<transcript>: Why does it need to be infection? This is show this to the clean code fanatics and watch them freak out.

01:30:30
<transcript>: So unsupported domain? Well, windows and nvm hates me oh, no? Why's? It hate you, cafe? I don't hate you. You're in a place where we don't hate you so thank you for coming home where no one hates you.

01:30:30
<transcript>: all right

01:30:35
<transcript>: All right. It's type. Never. So typescript doesn't even exist. Yeah, exactly.

01:30:35
<transcript>: json

01:30:38
<transcript>: Json string print the entire data.

01:30:51
<transcript>: So if my type I guess I'm relying on gamera domain being accurate that it only could include those five domains. If this is accurate then the only case here is PGA that's left.

01:30:54
<transcript>: Maybe I should just make this case. Pga.

01:30:56
thetonykano: Is that an actual camera track, or is it a programming trick to use a full scene to then zoom into it and move between the full screen to be able to simulate a camera track?

01:30:57
<transcript>: Ace PGA.

01:30:57
<transcript>: that's really the only

01:31:06
<transcript>: That's really the only other case. There shouldn't even need to be a default in this case. Wait. What? Oh, yeah. Because it can't be wait. No, I don't actually know.

01:31:09
<transcript>: J is not comparable to what.

01:31:12
<transcript>: Okay. I'm leaving that on default.

01:31:12
<transcript>: let's

01:31:16
<transcript>: Let's get these six so MLB Box score.

01:31:16
<transcript>: let's go here

01:31:19
<transcript>: Let's go here and the props here is going to be.

01:31:22
<transcript>: Mlb.

01:31:25
<transcript>: Doesn't even exist yet.

01:31:25
<transcript>: no i

01:31:27
<transcript>: No, I haven't. Yeah. Here we go.

01:31:33
<transcript>: Cool.

01:31:33
<transcript>: so

01:31:35
<transcript>: So there's gonna be problems. There probably.

01:31:35
<transcript>: is

01:31:37
<transcript>: Is there.

01:31:37
<transcript>: maybe not

01:31:41
<transcript>: Maybe not. Oh, no, cuz. I haven't even. I haven't changed that. Okay.

01:31:41
<transcript>: so then let's

01:31:46
<transcript>: So then let's go to this one. And this is gonna be.

01:31:46
<transcript>: in h

01:31:48
<transcript>: In hlbox store.

01:31:52
<transcript>: We need to update here.

01:31:56
<transcript>: Cool, cool.

01:31:56
<transcript>: and i

01:32:06
<transcript>: And I'm an actual camera track. Or is it a program trick? No, it is actually a camera track. I do have a camera on a rig moving around behind my desk just for the production value.

01:32:15
<transcript>: I don't think you could simulate that.

01:32:15
<transcript>: i think

01:32:18
<transcript>: I think maybe AI could. I don't know.

01:32:21
<transcript>: Mechican thank you for the follow.

01:32:24
dnbull: Hey, Adam! HeyGuys

01:32:28
<transcript>: Okay. So we have these now. Correct. So this thing should just should render. I mean, this should be good.

01:32:28
<transcript>: did it

01:32:31
<transcript>: Did it, did it do the prettier thing.

01:32:31
<transcript>: no

01:32:32
<transcript>: No.

01:32:32
<transcript>: not

01:32:34
<transcript>: Not doing any prettier.

01:32:41
<transcript>: Dm. Bow is here. My favorite Miami friend.

01:32:44
<transcript>: At least someone from Miami showed up this morning.

01:32:45
thdxr: WTF

01:32:48
devagrawal09: LUL

01:32:48
<transcript>: Dax. Not just kidding. That should probably not.

01:32:51
thdxr: I literally just got here

01:32:55
<transcript>: You probably shouldn't join every day because it's the two of us.

01:32:55
<transcript>: are both

01:32:55
thdxr: to hear you say that

01:32:56
rambo247: i dont exist to you @adamdotdev ?

01:32:57
dnbull: LMAO

01:33:01
<transcript>: Are both watching each other's stream all day then we will get nothing done together when we try to build stuff together.

01:33:01
<transcript>: you literally

01:33:02
devagrawal09: you summoned him with that miami comment

01:33:04
<transcript>: You literally just got here to hear me say that.

01:33:06
beeut: LUL LUL LUL

01:33:07
<transcript>: The Miami crew just woke up.

01:33:10
dnbull: it was our secret..exposed Kappa

01:33:13
<transcript>: Rambo. Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot rambo. You're also from Amy. I need like a little like, you guys need like little labels.

01:33:13
<transcript>: that's like

01:33:14
tayloreddev: gotem

01:33:16
<transcript>: That's like a Miami label of some sort.

01:33:24
<transcript>: You summon him with that Miami comet? Yeah, exactly.

01:33:27
<transcript>: Thank for the follow hay hemp.

01:33:27
<transcript>: a hemp

<transcript>: Pretty afy it.

01:33:38
<transcript>: i think

01:33:40
<transcript>: I think prettier was working.

01:33:40

01:33:44
<transcript>: let's just try

01:33:46
thdxr: lol

01:35:00
devagrawal09: @anonymous_691 side projects (preferably open source)

01:35:02
<transcript>: And they sleep in for some reason I'm the West Coast. I know they're 2 hours behind, but even beyond that they just sleep later than us over here.

01:35:02
<transcript>: in the other part of the world

01:35:03

masi_beats: I'm good at writing resumes, let me know who can I help with it.

01:35:16
devagrawal09: build things you would like to use in your daily life

01:35:18
<transcript>: Literally the first things here. That's too funny. Dax. I love it so much. I can't use the linux on my work laptop. And Windows won't let me switch node versions without pseudo access, and I can't get access unless I ask it. That sounds so awful.

01:35:25
<transcript>: That sounds terrible. Massive beats. Welcome to Chat. I'm good at writing resumes. Let me know who I can help with it. Yeah, no.

01:35:25
<transcript>: i don't know

01:35:40

01:35:51
mecoupz: Adam do you have a writeup or video about your obs/streamlabs setup and overlays and such?

01:35:56
<transcript>: Oh, thank you for that. What was that? That was a subscription dalt. Thank you so much for that. Tier one sub. Kevin rose.

01:36:02
<transcript>: American Internet Entrepreneur cofounded. Revision Three dig.

01:36:02

01:36:08
<transcript>: Holy cow.

01:36:08
<transcript>: how old is he

01:36:09
structuredchris: not a model, pretty insulting tbh

01:36:13
<transcript>: How old is he? I'm just kidding. He also served as production assistant. That was such a dumb joke.

01:36:16
structuredchris: i'd ban that guy

01:36:17
<transcript>: I'm an old man joke. This is not even funny.

01:36:17
<transcript>: so

01:36:23
<transcript>: So Kevin Rose, so he. I act like him. I look like him. I don't really look like him, but I Act like in man.

01:36:43
<transcript>: Do you have a writeup or video about your obs streamlab setup and overlays and such somei coops? No. But you know what? I'm really like burning. I have a burning desire to create content around streaming because I love it so much. I might do this. I might do a writeup on, like.

01:36:43
<transcript>: just as

01:36:45
<transcript>: Just as a developer.

01:36:45
<transcript>: thing that could

01:36:51
<transcript>: Thing that could be helpful if you want to start streaming. Yeah, it'd be a good video. I'm just gonna make a video.

01:36:51
<transcript>: and it might

01:36:55
thdxr: I'm gonna tell eposvox you're competing with him

01:36:57
mecoupz: i've started tinkering with streamlabs and can't find good overlays

01:36:58
<transcript>: And it might just be for you guys. I don't know if broader YouTube cares, but I'm gonna make a video about streaming as a developer.

01:37:08
<transcript>: You're gonna tell? Oh, yeah, there is a guy. Yeah, I've seen his stuff. He makes like obs videos. Tell him I'm competing with him. Do you actually know him back.

01:37:11
<transcript>: Okay.

01:37:13
<transcript>: I need to figure this out.

01:37:13
<transcript>: so prettier

01:37:21
<transcript>: So prettier is not working. That is my biggest concern right now is prettier doesn't work. I thought we fixed pretty, but maybe we didn't get pretty or fixed.

01:37:21
<transcript>: i want to remember

01:37:23
thdxr: no I don't know him but this is a great opportunity to get to know him

01:37:23
<transcript>: I want to remember from earlier.

01:37:25
<transcript>: Kiro, thank you for that. Follow.

01:37:27
dnbull: the quality OBS setup is from nutty on youtube

01:37:30
masi_beats: that would be a worth video to watch

01:37:30
<transcript>: Now I don't know him, but this is a great opportunity to get to know him.

01:37:31
structuredchris: hidden lint error again :(?

01:37:39
adamdotdev: !overlays

01:37:44
<transcript>: Sorry, tinkering with Stream Labs and can't find good overlays. Yeah, I built all mine Mccoops. So it's all open source. Oh, it's open source. It's open source. Oh, there is that I've done this. Is that a command? No.

01:37:46
<transcript>: Github.

01:37:47
mecoupz: oh bth my wife could write a rant to you, because i ordered some stuff to start streaming lol :D

01:37:47
<transcript>: Com.

01:37:47
<transcript>: adam

01:37:48
devagrawal09: i can use some help with stream overlays

01:37:51
adamdotdev: https://github.com/adamelmore/overlays.git

01:37:54
<transcript>: Adam. Elmore. Such a bummer. Adam. Mmorlays. That get bigo.

01:37:54
thdxr: EposVox has a video on everything, just went through the lut stuff yesterday

01:37:58
<transcript>: Deb. You could do some help. I would love to help you. Dev.

01:38:00
<transcript>: Like seriously.

01:38:00
<transcript>: i

01:38:06
<transcript>: I want to know every pain point you hit Dev as you're getting started on this journey because.

01:38:06
<transcript>: i have

01:38:17
<transcript>: I have no desire, like, no desire to like, make a course and make money or some dumb reason to, like, teach people how to stream dev. I just really enjoy streaming software development.

01:38:17
<transcript>: and

01:38:24
devagrawal09: first one is just getting a second monitor LUL

01:38:26
<transcript>: And I think that's a good reason to make content. I think it would be the first time I'd be making something that I'm just really excited to make. Like, I really want to help other people do this because I love doing it so much.

01:38:26
<transcript>: so

01:38:29
thdxr: I'm going to make a Linux streaming guide

01:38:34
<transcript>: So I think that's actually a good reason for me to actually make the content. There might be like 20 people in the world that care about this content.

01:38:44
<transcript>: Because I care about it. So if you like, run into stuff and you have questions. Dev, I want you to pepper me with your questions, okay? It doesn't have to be in twitch. You can send me dms on whatever.

01:38:44
<transcript>: but i

01:38:49
masi_beats: nah, there is a bunch of people interested on this conten

01:38:50
<transcript>: But I want to help you get your Dev stuff going and then figure out how I can help other people do it by helping you. Okay.

01:38:52
masi_beats: content*

01:38:56
<transcript>: First one is just getting a second monitor. Yeah, that's like a first step.

01:38:56
<transcript>: you could probably do a

01:38:59
dnbull: but some people stop themselves from streaming because they think they need so much to stream when you dont. You just need a mic, a decent camera and youre good. And camera is optional lol

01:38:59
masi_beats: appreciate it from Argentina

01:39:00
<transcript>: You could probably do a second much so the way I'm doing this right now, Dev this screen you're looking at right now.

01:39:04
<transcript>: I conveniently play my camera which is me.

01:39:04
<transcript>: over top

01:39:06
thdxr: I think it'll be more than 20 people, lot of people have been messaging me about equipment questions

01:39:08
<transcript>: Over top of twitch chat so it does make it possible.

01:39:13
<transcript>: If you go with the layout kind of like this, you lose some screen real estate to work with.

01:39:13
<transcript>: but

01:39:14
<transcript>: But.

01:39:21
<transcript>: This way I can have chat on one monitor and I'll have to glance over at my I don't have to look at my other screen.

01:39:21
<transcript>: every time

01:39:23
<transcript>: Every time I want to read something.

01:39:23
<transcript>: okay

01:39:25
<transcript>: Okay.

01:39:29
<transcript>: There's a bunch of people interested in this kind. Okay, cool.

01:39:31
tayloreddev: I use an iPad for monitoring chat during stream

01:39:34
devagrawal09: @thdxr agreed

01:39:47
<transcript>: I would specifically probably be making content for developers to stream. I don't know that I have any tips for just like gamers that stream. I don't know what they do. That's different from what we do. Maybe it would be for like any creative professional that wants to stream. So if you're in streaming non gaming.

01:39:47
<transcript>: that's

01:39:55
<transcript>: That's the kind of content I want to make, by the way my wife could write, why does that thing get over top of that sometimes where I can't see it.

01:39:55
<transcript>: get out

01:39:57
<transcript>: Get out of here.

01:39:57
<transcript>: get out of here

01:39:58
<transcript>: Get out of here.

01:40:02
devagrawal09: i am also going to stream music

01:40:03
<transcript>: My wife could write a ramp to you because I ordered some stuff to start streaming.

01:40:03
<transcript>: i'm

01:40:08
<transcript>: I'm sorry, Everyone's. Wives and husbands and partners. I'm sorry.

01:40:11
<transcript>: For any influence I've had.

01:40:15
devagrawal09: so need to figure out audio setup with my drums and stuff

01:40:27
<transcript>: Hidden lint there. Oh, maybe there's a hidden lint error. Is that what we ran into earlier structure? Chris, did we ever see prettier work? I don't know if we ever saw it work.

01:40:33
stroopwafel26: any tips on doing shower streams

01:40:37
<transcript>: Episode has a video on everything just went through the let stuff yesterday. He does have a lot of stuff. I'm probably saying his name way wrong.

01:40:42
<transcript>: Oh, dak, you're gonna make a linux streaming guy. There you go. I'll make a Mac one.

01:40:45
devagrawal09: @stroopwafel26 keep your underwear on

01:40:53
stroopwafel26: k thanks

01:40:56
<transcript>: But some people stop themselves from streaming because they think they need so much to stream when you don't, you just need a mic, a decent camera and you're good. And camera is optional. Yeah. Dm bowl most of my tips, I guess, would be around, like.

01:41:04
devagrawal09: unless you're streaming on kick dot com

01:41:06
fragaverage: @stroopwafel26 camera quality is everything, so I hear

01:41:07
<transcript>: Not the camera, not the like gear side of it, but more like I mean, there is a lot with obs to learn and just like making sure you understand, kind of like.

01:41:21
<transcript>: I don't know, sharing screens and codes. And I feel like some people have done some of this stuff. I think Rocks has a video that kind of goes through. Like, here's some things you should know. Your text needs to be huge. And like that kind of stuff. Like if you're sharing coding on screen.

01:41:21
<transcript>: but then

01:41:23
<transcript>: But then also just like.

01:41:28
<transcript>: Some thoughts I have on the journey.

01:41:34
<transcript>: As a developer getting into twitch because it was a very unique experience.

01:41:34
<transcript>: and

01:41:37
<transcript>: And I think some of the things I ran into.

01:41:37
<transcript>: are probably broader

01:41:42
<transcript>: Are probably broader applicable. And I'd love to talk through those. It's less like setup and more like.

01:41:42
<transcript>: just kind of like

01:41:46
<transcript>: Just kind of like getting you prepared mentally for the process.

01:41:49
<transcript>: Okay.

01:41:57
thetonykano: Getting to know a little bit of everything, helps, spending money on equipment only if you can afford it but not required.

01:42:01
<transcript>: I think it'll be more than 20 people. A lot of people have been messaging about quick equipment questions. That's the questions I get. People say, like, make content about stuff people ask you questions about. All my questions are like, hey, what Mike, do you use.

01:42:07
<transcript>: Which I granted I bought a lot of really nice stuff. So maybe that's why I get those questions so much. But I do feel like there's people that want to know these things.

01:42:10
<transcript>: Matige. Think about follow.

01:42:13
<transcript>: Also Busy draft. Thank you for your follow.

01:42:13
<transcript>: okay

01:42:16
<transcript>: Okay, I'm down to water now.

01:42:19
<transcript>: We're done drinking the dandy blend.

01:42:25
<transcript>: Taylor using Ipad for monitoring Chat during stream that works.

01:42:29
<transcript>: I've thought about like ipad has really good.

01:42:34
<transcript>: Have like good synchronicity with Mac Computers, right? Like you can do.

01:42:34
<transcript>: you can

01:42:37
thetonykano: Good lighting can help make a C920 look closer to a more professional camera

01:42:37
<transcript>: You can like share it as a screen without even plugging it in that kind of thing.

01:42:37
<transcript>: i thought about doing something

01:42:41
<transcript>: I thought about doing something like that, but I guess you could just flip the twitch app.

01:42:45
<transcript>: I'm going to stream music. Oh, there's a whole another thing.

01:42:50
<transcript>: Like need to figure out audio setup. Yeah. So the streaming music.

01:42:50
<transcript>: oh oh you mean

01:42:54
<transcript>: Oh, oh, you mean you're gonna be playing the music? Dev.

01:42:54
<transcript>: is that what you mean

01:43:03
<transcript>: Is that what you mean? Thank you for the follow redo wars. Do you mean you're gonna be playing music, dev? I thought you meant like you're gonna be the.

01:43:05
devagrawal09: yep

01:43:10
<transcript>: Musician playing drums. I don't know what this is. This is playing grums. I guess.

01:43:11
thdxr: I finally got curtains so have consistent lighting in my room

01:43:11
<transcript>: Are you guys.

01:43:11
<transcript>: there's

01:43:14
<transcript>: There's a guy that plays drums on Twitter.

01:43:16
<transcript>: There's a drummer.

01:43:16
<transcript>: he seems pretty

01:43:20
thetonykano: @FragAverage Lighting over Camera

01:43:26
devagrawal09: there's quite a bit yeah

01:43:29
thdxr: that multicam drummer guy is insane

01:43:29
<transcript>: He seems pretty goofy, but audio setup is a whole nother thing. Like setting up audio correctly for streaming was a whole nother thing. Any tips on doing shower streams? Don't just don't do them. That's my tip.

01:43:29
<transcript>: keep your end

01:43:31
<transcript>: Keep your end or on.

01:43:31
<transcript>: unless you're streaming

01:43:32
devagrawal09: 8bitdrummer

01:43:39
<transcript>: Unless you're streaming on kick, Calm, I've heard about Kick. What is this kick thing? It feels like such an old person being like, what is this? Kick, calm.

01:43:39
<transcript>: came

01:43:48
<transcript>: Camera quality is everything. So I hear getting a little bit of everything helps spending money on equipment only if you can afford it but not required. Good lining can help make a seamless.

01:43:48
<transcript>: twenty look closer

01:43:56
devagrawal09: kick won't be relevant for long so you're fine not hearing about it

01:43:58
tayloreddev: A copy and paste of twitch

01:44:02
<transcript>: 20 look closer to a more professional camera. Yeah. I do think there's a lot more like people always ask what my camera is. And it's like it is like, what 20% of the equation. Probably like, there's so much more to a shot than the camera itself.

01:44:02
<transcript>: finally

01:44:10
<transcript>: Finally got curtains. So I have consistently lighting my room. Ooh dax. So it's not like plants coloring every angle.

01:44:21
tayloreddev: with some shady practices

01:44:22
<transcript>: Lighting over camera. It's quite a bit. Yeah, that multicammed drummer guys. Insane. Yeah, I've seen that eight bit drummers. That what is kick. Won't be relevant for long. So you're fine not hearing about it. Oh, kick calm. Yeah, Yeah.

01:44:25
<transcript>: Okay.

01:44:25
<transcript>: you know

01:44:30
<transcript>: You know what? It's I'm stuck on this prettier thing before I jump into that.

01:44:30
<transcript>: i think

01:44:32
<transcript>: I think.

01:44:32
<transcript>: time to

01:44:35
<transcript>: Time to eat a lot of bar because I'm actually kind of hungry.

01:44:40
<transcript>: If I'm hungry, I'm gonna get grumpy and I get grumpy.

01:44:42
<transcript>: Nobody's gonna enjoy that.

01:44:48
<transcript>: So how we doing.

01:44:48
dalt_kb: adamdo8Adambar

mrzexter69: is hotdog a sandwich?

01:44:54
<transcript>: Did anybody ever figure out if I've ever gotten prettier working on this stream? Did it ever work at the beginning.

01:44:57
<transcript>: Is a hot dog, a sandwich.

01:45:01
thdxr: yes

01:45:04
<transcript>: Oh, is it is a hot dog. A sandwich? I don't know. Welcome to Chat, Mr. Zxter.

thdxr: and ice cream is a soup

01:45:14
wolfhoundjesse: You’re asking if you are prettier?

01:45:15
devagrawal09: hotdog is technically not a sandwich but is very close to one

01:45:17
<transcript>: We've actually gotten some done today.

01:45:18
wolfhoundjesse: 😉

01:45:22
<transcript>: Usually I get to this point in the stream it's like almost 2 hours in so anything.

01:45:22
<transcript>: today

01:45:24
<transcript>: Today.

01:45:24
<transcript>: it's a monday

01:45:29
<transcript>: It's a Monday and we've done something. I think I have some allergies that are trying to end me.

01:45:29
<transcript>: that's

01:45:30
devagrawal09: hotdog really is a taco

01:45:30
stroopwafel26: is a larabar a sandwich

01:45:31
<transcript>: That's not great.

01:45:35
<transcript>: Ice cream is a soup. I don't know about that.

01:45:37
<transcript>: There's not the same consistency.

01:45:43
thdxr: my allergies are finally over

01:45:43
tymekdev: Cheese is just a loaf of milk

01:45:43
<transcript>: Jesse, what's going on? You're asking if you're prettier.

<transcript>: Oh, this is awesome. We're gonna look at this. I'm gonna pull this up on stream.

01:48:44
thdxr: hence why ice cream is a soup

01:50:34
<transcript>: Then spoke a spake, the Holy prophet, that person.

01:50:34
<transcript>: are you

01:50:41
<transcript>: Are you unsatisfied with current debates regarding what Israeli is not a sandwich? You should try using the cube Rule for identifying what you're eating.

01:50:43
<transcript>: What.

01:50:43
<transcript>: 's the

01:50:47
<transcript>: 's The US With the Grand Unified Theory of Food Identification, the cube rule.

01:51:14
<transcript>: And six is a calzone. Okay, so is a poptartic calzone. Is that what they're getting at.

01:51:21
<transcript>: So identify any food purely by the location of structured starch.

01:51:24
<transcript>: Host So pizzas toast.

01:51:29
earholesmcgee: pop tart is top and bottom its a sandwhich

01:51:29
<transcript>: That kind of sushi's toast pumpkin pie. Okay.

devagrawal09: this is why you're not the favorite miami friend, you broke his prettier, he's not pretty anymore

01:54:58
<transcript>: I guess we could try opening a file, reboot the computer. We try opening a file that's not in that project. Let's try this one.

01:55:03
<transcript>: Okay. So it's working in a type script file.

01:55:05

01:56:31
<transcript>: This one has an issue.

01:56:34
<transcript>: Wait.

01:56:40
<transcript>: This one might be explained from that. So let's just do this.

01:56:47
<transcript>: I forgot I'm not even key casting? Are you even a streamer? If you're not keycasting.

01:56:52
<transcript>: I warned you my prettier setup wasn't great. Okay, well, I'll give you a pass then.

01:57:41
<transcript>: Okay. We've reached the part of the playlist that I don't like.

01:57:45
<transcript>: And we started all over.

<transcript>: Has this which is going to be.

02:19:46
<transcript>: I need.

<transcript>: Paste that instead.

02:19:56
<transcript>: These are all gonna be.

02:19:56
<transcript>: string

02:19:57
<transcript>: String.

02:20:06
<transcript>: Can I just do a string of fine replace on these.

02:20:11
<transcript>: Somehow. Or do I just do it like this. I'm just doing it like this.

02:20:24
<transcript>: Anyone triggered by this, I could have done a string replace. Probably. But by the time I figured out how to write all that. Oh, no.

02:20:27
playercake: i'm so triggered

02:20:30
<transcript>: That works.

02:20:33
<transcript>: Triggered player cake. So sorry.

02:20:37
<transcript>: What did I miss here.

02:20:40
playercake: PepeLaugh

02:20:42
zol0: im satisfied

02:20:42
<transcript>: 200 off my it is an extensive five. Yeah. Are you working alone on this rewrite.

02:20:48
<transcript>: Kind of so Eric is one of our other frontend devs.

02:20:48
<transcript>: he's

02:20:53
<transcript>: He's gonna be stepping in here and helping me with some parts of it very soon.

02:20:53
<transcript>: but so far

02:20:56
<transcript>: But so far I've just been doing alumni.

02:21:05
<transcript>: Our NFL team gains that so that's what this is.

02:21:05
<transcript>: nf

02:21:08
devagrawal09: "other frontend devs" meaning you consider yourself a frontend dev?

02:21:09
<transcript>: Nfl Team gamestats. Same with this.

02:21:09
<transcript>: tool

02:21:11
<transcript>: Tool.

02:21:11
<transcript>: oh

02:21:13
<transcript>: Oh, home is.

02:21:13
<transcript>: way

02:21:14
<transcript>: Way.

02:21:24
<transcript>: Team detail. And then player detail. Those are grids scoring summary. Okay, here we go. We're on the last run, the home stretch. This is a.

02:21:24
<transcript>: string

02:21:30
<transcript>: String. So is this so is this. This is a number.

02:21:37
<transcript>: On a number, J. But a number. And this is also a number. Okay. And then there's just gonna be an array of these.

02:21:45
<transcript>: Right. They're all the same? Yeah.

02:21:47
<transcript>: Okay.

02:21:49
<transcript>: That's it.

02:21:49
<transcript>: array of those

02:21:50
<transcript>: Array of those things.

02:21:59
<transcript>: Should I do it this way? I feel like sometimes there's a reason to do one or the other. And I don't know what it is. They might be equivalent. I don't know. I'm doing it that way.

02:22:03
<transcript>: Type NFL and historical box core, which I'm going to remove and put at the top.

02:22:12
<transcript>: Nfl teams that yep, yep, yep. Looks good. We got our type for NFL. Done.

02:22:12
<transcript>: what is

02:22:13
<transcript>: What is this.

02:22:16
<transcript>: Let's the old one.

02:22:16
<transcript>: cool

02:22:17
<transcript>: Cool.

02:22:20
<transcript>: Cool, let's go back.

02:22:22
<transcript>: To here.

02:22:28
<transcript>: So this is the we want to go do this is the NFL box for.

02:22:31
<transcript>: That.

02:22:34
<transcript>: And delete that.

02:22:41
<transcript>: Okay, so there should be some type errors in here. Now, if my editor wasn't busted.

02:22:48
<transcript>: I'm gonna get Teged. Come on, do a colabatige and let him fix my in them. Okay, there we go.

02:22:52
<transcript>: So we got some errors, which is what we wanted to see.

02:22:52
<transcript>: other frontend

02:22:55
<transcript>: Other frontendes, meaning you consider yourself a front end Dev.

02:22:55
<transcript>: i

02:23:07
<transcript>: I don't know what I consider myself. Honestly, dev, I have no idea if you could tell me what I am. That would be great. I think I'm one of those, like, kind of just bad at everything. Like I do everything, but I'm bad at everything, too.

02:23:07
<transcript>: not bad but

02:23:13
<transcript>: Not bad, but like not particularly good. That's the Jack of all trades. I don't know.

02:23:13
<transcript>: i'm something

02:23:18
<transcript>: I'm something. I'm not sure what it is. I think I'm unique. That's all I know.

02:23:20
<transcript>: It's all I know, I think.

02:23:20
<transcript>: maybe

02:23:24
<transcript>: Maybe I'm suited for being like a.

02:23:27
<transcript>: Greenfield Project created.

02:23:27
<transcript>: so when i

02:23:30
devagrawal09: you are looking for the term fullstack dev

02:23:31
<transcript>: So when I cofounded statmes, maybe that's what I'm gonna ask. I don't know. I feel like I'm good at something.

02:23:31
<transcript>: here's the thing

02:23:36
<transcript>: Here's the thing. Here's the thing. And I'm gonna just come over here to say this. Here's the thing.

02:23:36
<transcript>: i don't

02:23:50
<transcript>: I don't genuinely don't think I'm that good at much of anything when it comes to programming, like when I sit down at a computer, the actual typing and the doing things at the computer. I don't think I'm very good at, but for some reason I've made a lot of money in my career. I feel like I've done really well.

02:23:50
<transcript>: like

02:24:01
neochromer: haha humble brag

02:24:07
<transcript>: Like financially as a developer. And granted, like most developers are making pretty good money. And I'm in the US. So like us Dev money. Sure it's good. But I think I've done even better than that. And I'm not sure why someone tell me why I'm making more money.

02:24:07
<transcript>: on

02:24:12
<transcript>: On average than an average developer. I make above average developer money, and I feel like I'm.

02:24:14
<transcript>: Average or below I.

02:24:14
<transcript>: develop

02:24:16
<transcript>: Developer skill does that make sense.

02:24:22
<transcript>: I don't know what it is. I think it's people skill skills or something. Humble brag. I'm not trying to humble brag.

02:24:22
<transcript>: other

02:24:28
neochromer: yeah just lacky / people skills makes sense

02:24:30
devagrawal09: no that does not make sense

02:24:34
<transcript>: Other frontends. Oh, no. You're looking for the term full stack dev. Yeah, I think I'm full stacked. I don't know what full SEC is anymore, because I feel like full stack is like, you know how to ride an xjs happen, right? Like, api wrap.

02:24:36
<transcript>: That full stack.

02:24:41
dnbull: Here you go again Adam. This is the same concept of "I don't know what I'm doing" You put yourself down too much

02:24:41
<transcript>: Just lucky people skills. I think it is a lot of luck too.

02:24:41
<transcript>: no that

02:24:44
<transcript>: No, that does not make sense. Okay.

02:24:44
<transcript>: here you go

02:24:49
<transcript>: Here you go again. Adam, this is the same thing concept of I don't know what I'm doing. You put yourself down too much. I'm really.

02:24:49
<transcript>: not trying to

02:24:50
neochromer: lacky - lucky lol

02:24:51
<transcript>: Not trying to put myself down.

02:24:51
<transcript>: i know i

02:24:55
<transcript>: I know I've done well in life. I did not know.

02:24:55
<transcript>: if there's anything

02:24:55
thdxr: I've been thinking about this, the group of people that make FAANG money without working at FAANG are pretty different skillset makeup wise

02:25:07
<transcript>: If there's anything I can take from it, I think this is why I never have advice, like, I just genuinely don't because I feel like my advice is like, I don't know, be super lucky and hit every life circumstance that I hit and everything will be fine.

02:25:07
<transcript>: like

02:25:15
basileus__: Maybe you just think you don't know much but in actuality your brain is hiding all the automatic knowledge from you

02:25:16
<transcript>: Like I don't have any I don't know any generally applicable thing that's happened to me that I could, like, apply to anyone else's life. I just feel like it's probably just kind of lucky.

02:25:16
<transcript>: dax i've been

02:25:16
neochromer: @thdxr I know a guy who makes ton of money bcs he knows Ruby on Rails

02:25:33
<transcript>: Dax, I've been thinking about this. The group of people that make Fang money without working at, saying, are pretty different skills. That makeup wise. Yeah, I feel like I make Fang money, but I've never had to work. I've never had a resume. You know what I mean? Like, I've never had to, like, apply for a job, let alone work at Fang.

02:25:37
devagrawal09: @thdxr you mean i gotta learn makeup now

02:25:44
<transcript>: First time chat. Welcome to Chat best elias. Maybe you just think you don't know much, but in actuality, your brain is hiding all the automatic knowledge from you. I know, I know a lot.

02:25:44
<transcript>: i know

02:25:47
thdxr: I never had a quarterly review LUL

02:25:50
<transcript>: I know, like, I know a lot, and I know what I'm doing. I just made a video about that.

02:25:50
<transcript>: all of that

02:25:51
neochromer: @adamdotdev what did you do in your career? did you code or did you do devops?

02:26:00
<transcript>: All of that. I know. I checked the boxes. I just don't think I'm, like, particularly good at writing software. Like, I think I do a lot of things. Really sloppily.

02:26:00
<transcript>: i think it

02:26:07
<transcript>: I think it must be good in certain contexts. Maybe. I don't know. I feel like I've been effective at making things in my career with people.

02:26:07
<transcript>: but

02:26:16
<transcript>: But I don't feel like I can tell you what skills I have that are above average, if any. Dread pirate Robert, thank you for that. Follow.

02:26:16
<transcript>: does that make

02:26:19
devagrawal09: "i know what i'm doing" in itself puts you ahead of the curve

02:26:23
<transcript>: Does that make sense? I don't know. I need somebody to figure it out. And articulate for me, because I'm not articulating. It.

02:26:23
<transcript>: i know a guy

02:26:27
s1hofmann: Making money in tech is way more than programming. It's people skill, empathy, curiosity, in some cases it's being in the right place, at the right time. Having a feeling for what people actually need (when building products)

02:26:27
thdxr: I used to make a lot of money and then I started working on open source full time and my wife went full time on a business at the same time

02:26:27
<transcript>: I know a guy who makes a ton of money because he knows ruby on rails. There you go.

02:26:30
devagrawal09: most people dont know what they're sdoing

02:26:34
thdxr: think we make 3x less money now

02:26:39
<transcript>: Never had a Coral Rear review. Exactly. I've never had a performance review. I've never been like, I don't know. I'm just not had a normal career, but I feel like I've made good US tech money.

02:26:39
<transcript>: what did you do

02:26:43
<transcript>: What did you do in your career? Did you code or did you do DevOps.

02:26:43
<transcript>: coding

02:26:57
<transcript>: Coding. So I started out as a freelance developer, web developer. For, like, five, six years. I built up a little like agency. So I had, like, subcontractors under me. Okay. So this is probably gonna get some clues. I had some subcontract.

02:26:57
<transcript>: subcontractors

02:27:01
<transcript>: Subcontractors under me we did like software for.

02:27:01
<transcript>: banks

02:27:02
<transcript>: Banks.

02:27:09
<transcript>: So I did that for, like, five, six years. Then I started stat muse in 2014.

02:27:09
<transcript>: and

02:27:13
<transcript>: And worked there for five years after we raised the money.

02:27:16
<transcript>: And then.

02:27:16
<transcript>: i did more

02:27:17
<transcript>: I did more consulting.

02:27:27
<transcript>: For startups, mostly because I had the last startup experience. People wanted me to consult for startups. So like I did that I advise some startups I consulted.

02:27:35
<transcript>: And now I'm back at Stanmes. So there you go. There's my career. Before all of that, I've lifeguard. And I worked at Best buy.

02:27:35
<transcript>: square

02:27:37
<transcript>: Square PL things. So should that follow.

02:27:43
<transcript>: I know what I'm doing isn't itself puts you ahead of the curve.

02:27:49
<transcript>: Yeah. But, like, I can know what I'm doing and still know. I don't think I'm particularly, like.

02:27:50
neochromer: damn

02:27:53
zappy_idk: why did you leave statmuse in between?

02:27:56
<transcript>: Great at it. You know what I mean? Like, I figured it out, but like, I know there are people who are way better, technically.

02:27:56
<transcript>: at doing

02:27:58
<transcript>: At doing the same things I do.

02:27:58
<transcript>: and

02:28:02
<transcript>: And I think I've probably made more money than some of them.

02:28:22
<transcript>: Like, sometimes I realize I'll compare myself to something I see on Twitter. And then, like, wait a minute. My life's awesome. Why do I care? Like, I could have a sass or whatever and not be happier than I am right now. Making money in tech is way more than programming. It's people skillskill, empathy, curiosity. In some cases, it's being in the right place to the right time.

02:28:22
<transcript>: having a feeling

02:28:28
<transcript>: Having a feeling for what people actually need when building products. Yeah. I think a lot of that stuff.

02:28:37
<transcript>: I used to make a lot of money, and then I started working on open source fulltime, and my wife went fulltime on a business at the same time. Yeah. Once you own a business.

02:28:37
<transcript>: you stopped making

02:28:40
<transcript>: You stopped making a lot of money, so I made a lot of money in the beginning, part of my career.

02:28:40
<transcript>: basically

02:28:43
<transcript>: Basically made a lot of money every time I wasn't.

02:28:50
<transcript>: A cofounder. So when we started statmes, that's when we put everything on hold and.

02:28:50
<transcript>: didn't make

02:28:52
<transcript>: Didn't make a lot of money for a while.

02:28:52
<transcript>: and we

02:28:57
neochromer: I don't code at all at my work currently I do mostly Devops and Architecture stuff which I find super boring, but it does pay good.. so I'm on a crossroads to go all into the job or go back to coding

02:29:00
<transcript>: And we paid ourselves well after we were raised enough money to do so. But like I made more money just when I was doing my own thing.

02:29:03
<transcript>: Most people don't know what they're doing.

02:29:03
<transcript>: i think we

02:29:09
<transcript>: I think we make three times less money now. Yeah, exactly. X four poor entrepreneurs. That's what we are.

02:29:14
<transcript>: Why did you leave sat meets in between. I didn't leave that music. So this was a whole story.

02:29:14
<transcript>: and i don't

02:29:22
<transcript>: And I don't like to tell it too often because I know I have the time and space, and I don't want people to jump to conclusions.

02:29:26
<transcript>: Not just to conclusions. I got fired. So I got five.

02:29:30
<transcript>: Cofounder. Back in 2019.

02:29:30
<transcript>: mostly

02:29:37
<transcript>: Mostly. I don't want people to think like things are bad, like things are good. Now me and my cofounder are good. But at the time we hated each other, I was.

02:29:48
<transcript>: Never like setting that together publicly, but I would say we hated each other like we couldn't be on a phone call without a mediator like we had to have our friend Jay J. Station, who comes on the stream sometimes.

02:29:48
<transcript>: he had

02:29:51
thdxr: me and Adam both got fired by our cofounder in 2019

02:29:52
<transcript>: He had to be on every call with us because we just couldn't stand each other.

02:29:52
<transcript>: it

02:29:58
<transcript>: It had to end at some point. And he was the CEO, and he fired me. And he showed.

02:29:58
<transcript>: i was j

02:30:06
<transcript>: I was jerk, didn't like him one bit. And it was just really tough for a while. But then after a few years, it was three years that I've gone.

02:30:13
<transcript>: We started talking again. Kind of get because we were best friends before that. I mean, like we grew up together since, like kindergarten. We've been closed.

02:30:13
<transcript>: for a long time

02:30:18
dinisskizee: @thdxr boss moves AHAHAH

02:30:23
nft_scam: damn

02:30:24
the_true_jinx: why did yall start the company together then?

02:30:27
<transcript>: For a long time. So we the relationship started healing after some time away. And, yeah, it made sense to come back, but that's kind of the story. It's hard to tell it in a short way. Without, like, I don't know. I always just kind of, like, blabber on.

02:30:27
<transcript>: okay

02:30:31
thdxr: and we both sold our equity to sucker new investors

02:30:37
devagrawal09: @the_true_jinx ...because they were good friends

02:30:43
zappy_idk: Its great that you both made up :D

02:30:48
<transcript>: Okay. I don't code at all at my work. Currently, I do mostly DevOps and architecture stuff, which I find super boring, but it does pay good. So I'm on a crossroads to go all into the job or go back to coding. Yeah. The DevOps thing is interesting. I don't know. Like I've done a lot of it, but it was always out of necessity. Like stat me. It's like startup stuff. Like we just somebody's got to get all this stuff running.

02:30:48
<transcript>: on our aw

02:30:49
bronifty: Suckas!

02:30:52
<transcript>: On our aws account. So I kind of like started that way, just figuring stuff out.

02:30:57
<transcript>: With help from people, we hired somebody who did just DevOps.

02:31:00
andreaslorozco: thanks for sharing @adamdotdev

02:31:07
devagrawal09: devops seems like an easy way to make money since you'll get picked up by large companies

02:31:10
the_true_jinx: so the hating started because of the company?

02:31:14
<transcript>: Which we call the devops. I don't even know if it was devops, but he just managed all our infrastructure like that was what he did. And he taught me a lot. His name is Ben. I know a lot of bins. Me and Adam both got fired. Bark offenders in chuss 19. Yeah, me and Backs have some crazy, similar stories.

02:31:19
<transcript>: What's funny is. And I love my cofounder eli's. Great.

02:31:19
<transcript>: denny

02:31:21
<transcript>: Denny. But this is the funny thing is.

02:31:21
<transcript>: back when

02:31:32
<transcript>: Back when, like, we started statmes. I didn't even think about titles mattering. It was just kind of like, yeah, I'll be CTO. I'm technical ub CEO, and then turns out the CEO can fire the CTO.

02:31:32
<transcript>: which he

02:31:46
<transcript>: Which he should have fired me again. No. Like, no hard feelings on all that. Because I know it was the right thing. It's a time I was depressed. It was like I just got fired from my own startup. Like, what am I even doing in life? I'm up around the house for like, months.

02:31:50
<transcript>: In retrospect it's all much more clear? But Yeah.

02:31:50
<transcript>: titles do

02:31:55
<transcript>: Titles do Matter. Why did you all start the company together? We started it.

02:31:55
<transcript>: because we wanted to

02:32:06
nate_codes: MOM GET THE CAMERA ADAMS LIVE!

02:32:12
<transcript>: Because we wanted to build some together. So this was five years before, like, he fired me after five years. So it's not like we started the company because we hated each other. We started the company. Everything was great. And we had a great first three, four years. And then by the end, it was just I'm building a company's hard. There was a lot of stuff we went through.

02:32:12
<transcript>: fundraising

02:32:12
thdxr: I hope one day I get to fire Adam

02:32:16
thdxr: and we hate each other

02:32:19
gasoil_gfx: hi

02:32:26
<transcript>: Fundraising is hard. Sometimes there's just a lot of differences of opinion about the direction of the company. And like, we just got tense and we're close enough to get really mad at each other. Sometimes, like, if you if you're really close to somebody, I think you can have those bigger flame outs.

02:32:28
devagrawal09: @thdxr who's the ceo of watch dot dev

02:32:30
<transcript>: We both sold our equity.

02:32:31
gasoil_gfx: any advice for beginners who want to start with a partner

02:32:40
<transcript>: Out loud, but yeah, because they were good friends. It's great that you both made up. Yeah, yeah, we're good. Now. Thanks for sharing. You're welcome.

02:32:45
<transcript>: Devops seems like an easy way to make money since you'll get picked up by large companies.

02:32:52
<transcript>: So the hating started because we got a yeah, yeah, exactly. Mom, get the camera. Adam's. Life.

02:32:58
<transcript>: Hey, nate. How you doing? I hope one day I get to fire Adam.

02:33:04
<transcript>: A sign of our friendship. We've gotten that close. We can fire each other and hate each other.

02:33:04
<transcript>: ghesoli

02:33:04
thdxr: me because I do less work

02:33:08
<transcript>: Ghesoli gasol welcome, chat, Hello.

02:33:08
<transcript>: who's

02:33:14
<transcript>: Who's? The CEO of Watch dev. There is no legal entity for Watch dev. There is no anything.

02:33:14
<transcript>: watch that dev

02:33:18
<transcript>: Watch that Dev is an idea. It lives in our hearts.

02:33:18
<transcript>: any advice

02:33:21
<transcript>: Any advice for beginners who want to start with a partner.

02:33:26
<transcript>: That's me because I do less work. That's funny. You want to start with a partner.

02:33:28
dinisskizee: would you say that is relatively easily to build a website that covers a certain interest and make money out of it? I mean for example 1/2k+ month

02:33:35
thdxr: he's asking for dating advice

02:33:36
<transcript>: So I've only cofounded a company like officially cofounded a company with eli. That was the only time I've done it. And I can't imagine.

02:33:36
techsavvytravvy: yoooo

02:33:39
<transcript>: Going through some of the things we had to go through in the first few years.

02:33:43
daneoshiga: joined at marriage advice time?

02:33:53
12zhunus: I was off for a bit did you remap it to wtf?

02:33:59
<transcript>: With somebody. I just didn't know that. Well, if I didn't know my cofounder, well, that would be really hard. And I see why cofounding team split up more often earlier, even because it's just there's a lot of stuff. It's like your livelihood. It's like you're trying to raise money so you can pay for rent after six months of not being able to raise like, that stuff gets really tense. And it's really.

02:33:59
<transcript>: easy

02:34:03
daglee: @thdxr You should ask admin to join your stream and then add fire to his image. Fired!

02:34:13
<transcript>: Easy to get, like really upset or to just like when a bail. And if you don't really have a good, strong bond with that co founder, I think it'd be tough. So I would recommend, like making sure it's somebody you want to spend a lot of time with and that you trust.

02:34:13
<transcript>: and

02:34:15
thdxr: do what I did and start a company with your wife

02:34:16
<transcript>: And all of those things.

02:34:16
<transcript>: ace

02:34:18
<transcript>: Ace AC J for.

02:34:18
<transcript>: thank you for that

02:34:20
<transcript>: Thank you for that. Follow.

02:34:20
<transcript>: thank you so much

02:34:21
<transcript>: Thank you so much.

02:34:24
<transcript>: He's asking for dating advice.

02:34:32
thdxr: you're basically marrying your cofounder anyway

02:34:34
nate_codes: @dinisskizee yeah Shopify is pretty easy

02:34:36
<transcript>: Would you say that it is relatively easy to build a website that covers a certain interest and make money out of it? I mean, for example, one to two K a month. Honestly, I don't know, Danny.

02:34:38
devagrawal09: @thdxr that feels even more risky lol the worst case is a straight up divorce

02:34:39
<transcript>: I just don't know much about.

02:34:45
<transcript>: It's funny because now status is kind of in that business like we have ads on our site.

02:34:52
dinisskizee: @thdxr whats your company

02:35:05
<transcript>: So I guess I should kind of know something about it, but I don't know how easy it is. We built something that was for people who are like us and that we're very passionate about something. They were sports fans and sports fans are very into their thing. So if you build something exciting for a group of people that are really excited about something like sports, then I think it can take off.

02:35:05
<transcript>: and

02:35:07
nate_codes: Divorce might be easier than ch11 in the US tbqh

02:35:10
<transcript>: And ours did. But a lot of that could be luck, too. I don't know. It's tough. Right place, right time. That kind of thing.

02:35:17
<transcript>: Danille joined at marriage advice time. Yeah, we're talking about cofounding companies. Sorry. I got really close to my mic. There.

02:35:18
thdxr: don't have much of a public presence yet, it's a tool for services businesses to run all their ops

02:35:21
devagrawal09: long time no see nate

02:35:22
dinisskizee: I was thinking of a stats tracker for some upcoming game like source 2 that is coming out very soon, supposedly the replacement of csgo

02:35:25
<transcript>: You should ask admin to join your stream and then add fire to his image. Fired. Oh, Adam.

02:35:31
<transcript>: I was off for a bit. Did you remap it to wtf? No, we didn't. Twelve Z. I'm sorry.

02:35:39
<transcript>: Do what I did and started company with your wife. Now, there you go. They say, like a cofounding relationship is like a marriage.

02:35:39
nate_codes: @devagrawal09 HeyGuys

02:35:42
<transcript>: You just co found a company with your wife.

02:35:44
gasoil_gfx: @adamdotdev i think my future partner isnt that hard worker, but i know him well

02:35:46
<transcript>: And you're already married. So nothing new.

02:35:46
<transcript>: exactly

02:35:47
<transcript>: Exactly.

02:35:52
dinisskizee: @nate_codes thats selling stuff, i was mostly thinking about adsense or a service?

02:35:54
<transcript>: Feels more risky. The worst case is straight divorced. The hatchery too. What's your company.

02:36:00
<transcript>: Oh, he's talking to dax. It's boomi.

02:36:11
<transcript>: Did it. Okay, I'm gonna try and catch up here. Oh, there's not that much more to read. Don't have much more of a public presence tool for service businesses to run all their apps.

02:36:14
<transcript>: Dev longtime knows cnate.

02:36:19
dinisskizee: @thdxr SeemsGood

02:36:34
<transcript>: And I was thinking of a statch tracker for some upcoming game like Source Two that is coming out very soon, supposedly the replacement of cs Go. So I've seen some of those sites I used to play herztone. And there's some like stat tracking sites for her sone. I've definitely seen those types of apps, I think, yeah, you make something good that's useful to you.

02:36:37
nate_codes: @dinisskizee building a website is easy. Making money is...slightly less easy...but making money != Building a site.

02:36:39
techsavvytravvy: also they don't have to testify against you in tax court 🤔

02:36:43
<transcript>: And you're someone who uses that thing. People are very passionate about their games that they play. So I think similar parallels, what we did with that means.

02:36:45
<transcript>: Okay.

02:36:51
daglee: Source 2 is out. Just not for csgo. Source 2 has been used for dota 2 for 5 years.

02:36:59
<transcript>: Why do I even come over to this camera? I don't even remember why I came over here, but while I'm over here before I get back to actually coding and stuff tonight, I think tonight I haven't heard the official word for my wife. We're happy somebody over to our house.

02:37:01
<transcript>: We don't do that. Ever.

02:37:01
<transcript>: but

02:37:07
<transcript>: But it's somebody that uses stat muse? How crazy.

02:37:07
<transcript>: they live

02:37:11
<transcript>: They live like right near us just like five minutes away.

02:37:11
<transcript>: and

02:37:11
devagrawal09: oh yeah we have a big org of engineers working on stats tracker, spec overlays, and so much stuff for aoe2

02:37:16
devagrawal09: it's amazing

02:37:19
<transcript>: And they're both software developers, husband and wife. And they use status for like fantasy sports research or something.

02:37:19
thdxr: oh no Adam is going to get murdered tn

02:37:21
<transcript>: And.

02:37:21
neochromer: Dax?

02:37:24
neochromer: oh nvm :LD

02:37:25
thdxr: can I have your equipment

02:37:27
<transcript>: They didn't know who I am or that stat News was co founded by somebody who lived five minutes from them.

02:37:27
<transcript>: but they're coming over

02:37:29
<transcript>: But they're coming over. We're gonna have dinner.

02:37:29
<transcript>: we'll see

02:37:32
<transcript>: We'll see see how it goes we don't like dudes.

02:37:36
techsavvytravvy: these random close ups

02:37:38
<transcript>: Ever so we'll see? Oh, no? Adam's gonna get murdered? Oh, boy.

02:37:42
<transcript>: That's terrifying.

02:37:43
nate_codes: @thdxr nice partner mpve!

02:37:44
<transcript>: Okay.

02:37:44
<transcript>: no not

02:37:45
andreaslorozco: good luck tonight!

02:37:45
<transcript>: No, not next.

02:37:46
stroopwafel26: rip

02:37:50
<transcript>: Can I have your equipment if I get murdered? Yeah. I'll leave it to you in my will. Dax.

02:37:50
<transcript>: these random

02:37:56
<transcript>: These random closeups. Yeah, the random thing. They're not supposed to be random. They're supposed to only Zoom in when I make big faces like this.

02:38:01
<transcript>: And it works. But it also there's a lot of false positives.

02:38:04
<transcript>: So we'll work on that out.

02:38:11
gasoil_gfx: @adamdotdev the problem is that  i think my future partner isnt that hard worker, but i know him well

02:38:11
thdxr: you never make those big faces

02:38:13
<transcript>: Okay, let's get back to it. I got a lot to do. What am I doing? Why am I just talking? This is not a just chatting stream. This is a. This is a programming stream. We program.

02:38:13
nate_codes: @stroopwafel26 wait youre my favorite snack!

02:38:13
gasoil_gfx: lol

02:38:15
gasoil_gfx: lmao

02:38:29
stroopwafel26: @nate_codes thanks - my wife says the same

02:38:29
<transcript>: The problem is that I think my future partner isn't that hard worker, but I know him well, then don't. Don't start it with him. If you already don't think that even if he is a hard worker, you already have that bias. And you're gonna resent him so quick. It's just not even gonna be funny. It's not gonna be fun, I promise. Don't do it.

02:38:32
<transcript>: Find someone else that you know well.

02:38:35
<transcript>: Any like built in buying.

02:38:35
<transcript>: that person

02:38:36
nate_codes: LUL

02:38:49
virtualtablefunction: Hello again.

02:38:50
<transcript>: That person or things that you perceive about that person that you've held for a long time will be amplified when you start a company with them. You'll like every little thing that bothered you about them before just in your friendship will be amplified. And you don't want that, I promise.

02:38:57
<transcript>: I never do make those big faces. Why do I have an autozone thing that's gonna Zoom in on me when I never make.

02:38:57
<transcript>: i can never make

02:39:09
<transcript>: I can never make the face that it's looking for. I guess I was thinking, like, I'd be looking at some code, and I get really mad. Like, Why is this do this? And it was Zoom in on me. But I guess I don't ever do that, do I.

02:39:09
<transcript>: am i

02:39:14
<transcript>: Am. I just pretty chill with my code. I'm like whatever codes, code, it just does stuff.

02:39:18
thdxr: there's no code that had

02:39:20
thdxr: bad

02:39:22
<transcript>: Hello Again virtual table.

02:39:27
nomabond: challenge accepted

02:39:30
<transcript>: There's no code that bad. Well, we'll see. We'll see. Won't we back? I might make some code. Why is this lsp so broken.

02:39:32
devagrawal09: @thdxr you should see my code

02:39:37
<transcript>: Why is it bugging me about these errors and stuff? I'm trying. I'm trying to get mad.

02:39:37
<transcript>: namaban

02:39:40
<transcript>: Namaban welcome to chat.

02:39:45
<transcript>: You should see dev code because we should join dev stream.

02:39:45

02:40:25
devagrawal09: no idea, probably as soon as i get my second monitor because streaming without 2nd sucks

02:40:30
<transcript>: First down, first down.

02:40:32
thdxr: all my code is public so people dunk on me by linking to GitHub

02:40:35
<transcript>: Rushing.

02:40:35
<transcript>: first

02:40:37
nate_codes: @devagrawal09 true

02:40:39
<transcript>: First down, no. First down. Threshing.

02:40:39
devagrawal09: @nate_codes thanks, i'll do more definitely

02:40:48
nexxeln: hi nate_codes!

02:40:48
<transcript>: And then passing first down. Oh, no. Passing first and rushing, then first downs from penalties.

02:40:54
nexxeln: wait dev streams now?

02:40:54
<transcript>: Passing.

02:41:04
devagrawal09: lol yeah my first stream was yesterday

02:41:04
virtualtablefunction: @thdxr I will never make my repos public for this reason lool

02:41:10
<transcript>: First downs from penalty.

02:41:19
<transcript>: I haven't figured out how to first downs from. Oh, it's supposed to be first. Like, one. Yeah.

02:41:19
<transcript>: spelling

02:41:22
<transcript>: Spelling it all out. And it should be like this.

02:41:25
<transcript>: First sounds.

02:41:28
<transcript>: Right.

02:41:28
nexxeln: followed you devagrawal09

02:41:29
devagrawal09: gonna be doing a lot of live coding

02:41:32
devagrawal09: ty

02:41:33
<transcript>: First down from penalty.

02:41:37
<transcript>: First downs from penalty's. All lowercase, though.

02:41:43
thdxr: I feel bad when I see PRs because I know they had to dig through some ugly stuff

02:41:46
<transcript>: That does stream. Now next he does.

02:41:54
<transcript>: All my code is public so people dunk on my on me by linking to GitHub.

02:42:06
<transcript>: My first dream was yesterday. I will never make my repository for this reason.

02:42:14
nate_codes: @adamdotdev you should give Dev a /shoutout...help out those small streamers!

02:42:15
<transcript>: Followed. You gonna be doing a lot of live coding. Feel bad when I see prs because I know they had to dig through some ugly stuff. Yeah.

02:42:23
<transcript>: I've never been self conscious about code. Like, I just have never. I've just. I don't know. I've never felt like.

02:42:24
devagrawal09: he did a while ago

02:42:31
nate_codes: Oh nice nvm then :)

02:42:31
<transcript>: It was tied to my identity or something. I guess I just always assumed everyone's as bad, and we all know it. I don't know.

02:42:31
<transcript>: first

02:42:35
<transcript>: First down from penalties. And then what's next.

02:42:37
<transcript>: Third down efficiency.

02:42:41
devagrawal09: but i won't be mad if he does again....

02:42:51
<transcript>: Third down efficiency. Yep.

02:42:54
thdxr: I'm going to do a negative shout-out

02:42:55
<transcript>: Third down efficiency.

02:42:55
<transcript>: yep

02:42:55
nomabond: "Everyone's is bad and we all know it".. jeez my life would be so much better with this mentality :D

02:42:56
<transcript>: Yep.

02:42:59
<transcript>: Oh, no, it's changing that to away.

02:42:59
virtualtablefunction: After work, I can never be bothered doing code for personal projects, so my GitHub is empty

02:43:02
thdxr: "don't watch dev"

02:43:03
devagrawal09: @thdxr shout-in

02:43:07
<transcript>: I'm going to do a negative shout out.

02:43:07
<transcript>: what's that

02:43:09
<transcript>: What's? That.

02:43:09
<transcript>: you should

devagrawal09: probably not lol i need to find a better name

02:43:44
<transcript>: Hey, if you stream it, just try time. Dev, I'll raid you. I would love to raid you. Everyone who likes watching my stream would love watching Dead stream.

02:43:48
<transcript>: I feel bad when I see prs because I know. Oh, I already read that.

02:43:56
<transcript>: Everyone is bad and we all know it. My life would be so much better with this mentality.

02:44:03
<transcript>: After work, I can never be behind doing code for personal projects on my GitHub is empty. No, I totally get that virtual.

02:44:06
zachrip: I feel bad when I see PRs because I know they had to dig through some ugly stuff

02:44:09
<transcript>: Probably not need to find a better name. Now your name's good.

02:44:15
<transcript>: I hate, like, I hate getting high up on stuff like that. I get so hung up on that, like.

02:44:15
<transcript>: i don't know about this

02:44:20
<transcript>: I don't know about this. Dev has kind of been like a thing I've developed since I got the domain.

02:44:20
<transcript>: but before

02:44:24
basileus__: I could write code for 16 hours a day. It's not good

02:44:27
<transcript>: But before that, I haded my handles on every social media. There was a thing that stressed me out so much. Why do we get stressed about that stuff? I hate it.

02:44:27
<transcript>: i'm not

02:44:31
thdxr: me and Adam didn't start working on rebase for like 4 days because we got stuck on the name

02:44:34
<transcript>: I'm not blaming you. I got stress, too. I just wish we didn't have to. What's wrong with this? Why is it saying I can't do this.

02:44:38
<transcript>: Away, home, that should be away. I mean.

02:44:38
neochromer: @VirtualTableFunction after I got married, same, I would like to and sometimes do but most of the time I'm spending quality time with my SO

02:44:40
<transcript>: Okay.

02:44:42
devagrawal09: i need a better name anyways for all socials, should be easy to say and type

02:44:46
<transcript>: Me and Adam didn't start working on rebates for, like, four days because we got stuck on the name. It's true.

02:44:49
<transcript>: It's so hard to name things.

02:44:49
<transcript>: i feel

02:44:53
<transcript>: I feel bad when I see prs because I know they had to dig through some ugly stuff. Wait a minute.

02:44:53
<transcript>: that's the exact

02:44:57
<transcript>: That's the exact message that dax posts. Zach, didn't he.

02:45:00
<transcript>: You just trying to make me think I already read that.

02:45:03
zachrip: no clue what you're on about

02:45:04
<transcript>: Good write code for 16 hours a day. It's not good.

02:45:05
nexxeln: mine is just nexxel or nexxeln lol

02:45:06
thdxr: why do you keep reading the same message lmao

02:45:10
stroopwafel26: @devagrawal09 maybe your first name dot dev is available still

02:45:10
<transcript>: I need a better name anyways for all socials should be easy to say and type.

02:45:14
nate_codes: I feel bad when I see PRs because I know they had to dig through some ugly stuff

02:45:16
<transcript>: Are you messin'with me? Zack? I can't tell.

02:45:16
<transcript>: mine

02:45:19
<transcript>: Mine is just nixel or next will.

02:45:25
<transcript>: Yeah. Next. I just like to call you next, but that's probably taken. You can't just choose that as a username.

02:45:25
<transcript>: why do you keep

02:45:25
thdxr: loling so hard

02:45:28
<transcript>: Why do you keep reading the same messages? Stop it.

02:45:30
devagrawal09: @stroopwafel26 that was my first idea lol it's taken everywhere

02:45:32
virtualtablefunction: I feel bad when I see PRs because I know they had to dig through some ugly stuff

02:45:39
<transcript>: You got to mess with me. I know you are. Hey, Mark Dan, thank you for that follow. And also obi wan Princess thank you for those follows. Mark down is your name actually Mark.

02:45:39
<transcript>: he's

02:45:43

02:56:28
nate_codes: Still beginner mode tbh

02:56:29
<transcript>: So passing should be 182 to 302.

<transcript>: and

stroopwafel26: heineken is dutch indeed, and it's bad

02:56:32

03:06:04
<transcript>: Some looks. Some looks off. Wait. No. Doesn't.

03:06:10
<transcript>: How do I want to line this up and make sure all the data is exactly correct. Line up on the top of that box.

03:06:14
<transcript>: And just like so.

03:06:18
<transcript>: Any differences? No.

03:06:24
<transcript>: Looks correct. I mean ignore the top changing. We haven't done the summary yet.

03:07:46
<transcript>: Flex. Okay, so we have these little like title. So what is this date even look like? Let's start looking at this data.

03:07:50
<transcript>: I have to make a new tab.

03:07:50
<transcript>: panel

03:07:51
<transcript>: Panel.

03:07:51
<transcript>: let's

03:07:53
<transcript>: Let's see.

<transcript>: Also done.

03:08:15
<transcript>: Yeah. Cool. Okay. So these are done.

03:08:21
<transcript>: I just need to do this. Scoring Summary tab.

03:08:25
<transcript>: And how does the data look for this tab.

03:08:27
<transcript>: Scoring.

03:08:31
mecoupz: 10 years ago when i worked with tourists here i always told them: "We are here in Austria, not Australia. We have the alps not kangoroo". every single one of them found that funny :D

03:09:39
<transcript>: summ

03:09:51
<transcript>: Summary. There it is. No, it's not dynamic. That's just fake. It's all fake. Look at the fakeness it's all fake. Let's get the real data, though, and let's plug in the real data. How are we gonna do that.

03:09:51
<transcript>: let's see

03:09:57
<transcript>: Let's see. I don't know what data it is so div. We're gonna have.

vimcerf: alias ls=rm Kappa

03:10:38
<transcript>: Scoring summary. Here we go. Okay, so it's just an array of these things. Quarter team description, hometeam score, away team score. Does that make sense.

03:10:44
<transcript>: Let's see. So the team I have to turn into an image somehow.

03:10:51
<transcript>: Somehow I have to get that image from the team. How I'm gonna do that.

03:10:51
<transcript>: we'll figure that out

03:10:52
<transcript>: We'll figure that out.

03:10:52
<transcript>: and then

03:10:56
<transcript>: And then. Oh, well, I guess we're doing it up here. Oh, is there an inner image.

03:10:56
<transcript>: those are hometeam

03:10:58
<transcript>: Those are hometeam image.

03:11:00
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:11:54
<transcript>: Author.

03:11:55
thdxr: I aliased vim to nvim lol

03:11:57
<transcript>: We're gonna actually look at the component that renders this thing.

03:12:07
<transcript>: What's something I could find first quarter. Let's just search first quarter and see.

03:12:11
imshootex: !switches

03:12:12
mecoupz: who here is old enough to remember "format C:" in windows?

03:12:15
<transcript>: What Else could I search summary.

03:12:21
<transcript>: Teams that's played Summary trying to find something that would bring me to the right place.

03:12:25
<transcript>: Team view.

03:12:26

<transcript>: a waiting home

03:12:59
<transcript>: A waiting home team. Oh, I see, because it's in the EA.

03:13:04
<transcript>: Okay I can see logo then get frame type.

03:13:04
<transcript>: quarter

03:13:06
vimcerf: I think that's what the DOM renders inside

03:13:09
<transcript>: Quarter inning period. Oh, we have to use this for multiple sports. Oh.

03:13:12
<transcript>: Okay.

03:13:20
<transcript>: You alias vim to end them.

03:13:30
<transcript>: So this is the this is the stuff.

03:13:30
<transcript>: what are fr

03:13:33
<transcript>: What are frames? Create frames.

03:13:35
<transcript>: What are create frames.

03:13:37
<transcript>: Oh, it's right here.

03:13:37
<transcript>: so

03:13:43
<transcript>: So pipe group by frame type. What is frame type.

03:13:45
<transcript>: So many questions.

03:13:45
<transcript>: if

03:13:47
<transcript>: If Sample play dot, quarter.

03:13:51
<transcript>: Oh, well, I don't have to do that.

03:13:51
<transcript>: i'm not gonna

03:14:02
<transcript>: I'm not gonna do this generic. I'm gonna do it different for each sport. I may not share as much code, but I'd rather have it explicit. So we're not gonna have the frame type thing. Map frame plays.

03:14:02
<transcript>: time

03:14:05
<transcript>: Time get frame type.

03:14:10
<transcript>: First frame, place.

03:14:14
<transcript>: Are you saying? What.

03:14:21
<transcript>: I don't understand this. Does anyone understand it? Team logo url I can figure that out.

03:14:21
sockthedev: ah, the glorious world of reading fp

03:14:24
<transcript>: I'm like.

03:14:32
<transcript>: The glorious world of reading. Functional programming. Is that what this is? Is this a functional programming? I guess I don't like functional programming.

03:14:32
<transcript>: because

03:14:39
<transcript>: Because I don't know pipe group by frame type so I guess I do have to render.

03:14:47
thdxr: hey

03:14:51
<transcript>: The so I frames that they mean like, first quarter, second quarter, third quarter. Yeah. I guess I do have to do that, right. I do have to render these things. Those things.

03:14:51
thdxr: that looks beautiful to me

03:14:55
<transcript>: But how are they doing it? They're saying.

03:14:55
<transcript>: core

03:14:59
<transcript>: Coreinning period group by.

03:15:02
<transcript>: Group by quarterinning period.

03:15:06
<transcript>: Is that what they're saying.

03:15:14
vapor__dev: is this using remeda

03:15:16
<transcript>: So you passed plays in.

03:15:22
<transcript>: That looks beautiful to you. Dax, can you then please tell me what I should do with it.

03:15:29
<transcript>: What's ramita it's using low dash Functional programming.

03:15:32
mecoupz: every devs kryptonite: naming things

03:15:32
<transcript>: Low FP.

03:15:36
<transcript>: Okay, I can do this.

03:15:36
<transcript>: i am

03:15:36
sockthedev: i went all in on fp once, but pulled back to more pragmatic balance of fp where i don't sacrifice readability

03:15:39
<transcript>: I am. I am capable. Here we go.

03:15:39
<transcript>: here we go

03:15:40
<transcript>: Here we go.

03:15:52
<transcript>: You went all in on social Programming. Once got pulled back, you pulled back more pragmatic. Balance.

03:15:56
<transcript>: Yeah. I think functional programming is really cool.

03:16:03
<transcript>: And I do love me like an elegant mapping.

03:16:10
taktaudimana: lodash is the start of chaos

03:16:13
<transcript>: Block. Like where there's nice mapping or matching. I mean, like, oh, that matches that case. But sometimes it's just really hard for my brain. I don't know.

03:16:13
<transcript>: lodash

03:16:21
<transcript>: Lodash is the start of Chaos. Tech. Todd? Welcome to Chat, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome to Chad.

03:16:21
<transcript>: so

03:16:26
<transcript>: So I'm going to how do I want to do this? I have a bunch of data.

03:16:26
<transcript>: and

03:16:30
<transcript>: And I need to render these little.

03:16:32
<transcript>: Frames.

03:16:34
<transcript>: They're calling them.

03:16:35
<transcript>: The frames.

03:16:37
<transcript>: Based on.

03:16:37
<transcript>: it's gonna be more

03:16:39
<transcript>: It's gonna be more involved than I thought it was.

03:16:39
<transcript>: scoring

03:16:45
<transcript>: Scoring Summary Map I guess I have to do some preconditioning of the data here.

03:16:48
<transcript>: I'm gonna have to do some stuff.

03:16:50
<transcript>: Some stuff.

03:16:55
<transcript>: And that's stuff is what that stuff is.

03:16:55
<transcript>: const

03:16:57
<transcript>: Const framed.

03:17:02
<transcript>: Equals Box Score Data Dot Scoring summary.

03:17:02
<transcript>: group

03:17:03
<transcript>: Group.

03:17:13
<transcript>: Why did I think it's gonna work that time? Scoring summary is a what.

03:17:18
<transcript>: An array. An array of these things.

03:17:20
<transcript>: Right.

03:17:20
<transcript>: quarter

03:17:24
<transcript>: Quarter Team Description Home Team Score number.

03:17:24
<transcript>: or

03:17:26
<transcript>: Or.

03:17:29
<transcript>: Is it.

03:17:37
<transcript>: But is it I think it is do all of them have the Quarter on them? Or is it like I should dump this into the let's see.

03:17:37
<transcript>: what

03:17:40
<transcript>: What did I just do? Let's see.

03:17:40
<transcript>: let's just cons

03:17:43
<transcript>: Let's just console log, console, log.

03:17:43
<transcript>: json

03:17:46
<transcript>: Json stringify.

03:17:48
<transcript>: Box Score data.

03:17:48
<transcript>: scor

03:17:50
<transcript>: Scoring summary.

03:17:51
mecoupz: console.log to the rescue

03:17:52
<transcript>: No.

03:17:59
<transcript>: Data. Looks like. Okay. So they all have the Quarter on them.

03:18:05
<transcript>: Quarter, first quarter, first quarter? Do I even need to make this dynamic.

03:18:21
<transcript>: Do I even need to make a dynamic? Can I just hard code? First quarters, second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, like, in what instance would there not be? I guess it's possible a game doesn't make it to the end or something like that. Bills bengals game. Damar hamlin. Like if it doesn't make it to the fourth quarter, then I guess.

03:18:21
<transcript>: maybe the

03:18:24
<transcript>: Maybe the data wouldn't have it. I don't know.

03:18:29
<transcript>: Should I do it dynamically.

03:18:32
<transcript>: Quarter, first quarter.

03:18:33
dalt_kb: also OT

03:18:36
<transcript>: We have the two teams.

03:18:36
<transcript>: also

03:18:46
<transcript>: Also overtime. Oh, good call, dolph. Thank you, dollt. Dot to the rescue about shot myself in the foot. So we do need to do this. We need to get out the unique course.

03:18:50
<transcript>: So here's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to.

03:18:50
<transcript>: i'm going

03:18:55
<transcript>: I'm going to map. Okay, so Const frames.

03:18:59
<transcript>: Map them all. Summary thank you so much for that. Follow Philly.

03:19:03
<transcript>: Philly. Jh. My Voice today.

03:19:03
<transcript>: struggling

03:19:04
<transcript>: Struggling.

03:19:08
<transcript>: We're gonna map them the Quarter, and then we're just gonna do, like.

03:19:12
<transcript>: Let's just do like the unique set of them.

03:19:16
<transcript>: That works? Would that change the order.

03:19:19
<transcript>: I just do like new set. The hell I.

03:19:20
stroopwafel26: i'm just here to learn about american sports, i have no idea what most of these things mean

03:19:34
<transcript>: Do.

03:19:41
<transcript>: Set. First quarter, second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter. I don't think that'll change the order ever will it.

03:19:44
<transcript>: Man I'm in.

03:19:44
<transcript>: first quarter

03:19:47
<transcript>: First quarter, second quarter. Quarter. Okay, cool.

03:19:50
<transcript>: So object object.

03:19:52
<transcript>: Cool.

03:19:58
<transcript>: If I do that then I have the the unique frames.

03:20:02
<transcript>: And then I need to group. I need to get all the data.

03:20:13
<transcript>: Stroop. You're here to learn about American Sports. Welcome to your American Sports education.

03:20:13
<transcript>: i don't know how

03:20:18
<transcript>: I don't know how valuable it is. In fact, I know it's not very valuable, but.

03:20:21
<transcript>: Here you go.

03:20:21
<transcript>: why can't

03:20:24
<transcript>: Why can't I? Why can't I do this.

03:20:26
<transcript>: I could die. There we go.

03:20:31
<transcript>: Don't mind me's little peek behind the curtain. Okay.

03:20:39
<transcript>: So. So so I guess I do need the quarter. And then I need the data in each quarter.

03:20:39
<transcript>: you know i'm saying

03:20:42
<transcript>: You know, I'm saying, like I need to actually.

03:20:48
<transcript>: I need to actually do something like they did. I'm not gonna land on exactly what they did.

03:20:52
<transcript>: I don't even know how to grow by I couldn't even get grouped by the work.

03:20:58
<transcript>: Isn't that a function in javascript? No, that's actually a functional programming thing group by Oh.

03:21:03
<transcript>: I'm also gonna have to get the time.

03:21:06
<transcript>: What's the time.

03:21:09
<transcript>: No. There's no time listed.

03:21:17
<transcript>: Oh, is it maybe another sports? It is. Let's just search for another sport. Let's go to.

03:21:24
<transcript>: Did the Cardinals win? And I'm gonna say, baseball.

03:21:34
<transcript>: Here we go. Home run. No time on this one. Just. These are the frames, right. The innings. Okay.

03:21:39
<transcript>: What about hockey.

03:21:39
<transcript>: did the

03:21:41
<transcript>: Did the Brewing swim.

03:21:49
<transcript>: I know. Is Hockey season going on right now? Okay, so no time ever listed. We don't list time. I don't know what time is.

03:21:49
<transcript>: in this case

03:21:51
<transcript>: In this case.

03:21:53
<transcript>: Okay.

03:21:57
<transcript>: Isn't there a group by in javascript? Can I not.

03:22:04
<transcript>: Group by.

03:22:22
<transcript>: Map at pop fill fine flat join keys push some sort every shift slice can catch filter reduce I might want to reduce.

03:22:25
<transcript>: Slice. No, I don't think I want to reduce.

03:22:25
<transcript>: i use

03:22:29
<transcript>: I use entries flat map for each.

03:22:29
<transcript>: index

03:22:32
<transcript>: Index of Reverse and Shift includes.

03:22:35
<transcript>: I think there was a group by in JavaScript.

03:22:38
<transcript>: Why did I think that.

03:22:40
<transcript>: Don't tell me.

03:22:40
<transcript>: give me all the answers

03:22:43
<transcript>: Give me all the answers in life.

03:22:45
<transcript>: I thought that there was a group by.

03:22:49
<transcript>: Well.

03:22:53
<transcript>: Well, let's see.

03:22:53
<transcript>: i guess i'm

03:23:04
<transcript>: I guess I'm gonna go back and we're gonna have these frame, so at least have the titles of the frames. And now I can go through. Okay, here's what we'll do. Comps Plays equals Box Core data.

03:23:08
captainsikay: Isn't group by a SQL thing?

03:23:09
<transcript>: Box Score Data Dot Scoring summary.

03:23:09
<transcript>: dot

03:23:11
<transcript>: Dot.

03:23:16
<transcript>: Isn't grouped by a sequel thing. Yeah. I thought there was something in javascript for grouping an array of objects.

03:23:21
<transcript>: So that was the thing. Why do I think, okay, I'm gonna Google it because I'm really.

03:23:21
<transcript>: jav

03:23:23
<transcript>: Javascript.

03:23:23
<transcript>: group

03:23:25
<transcript>: Group by.

03:23:29
<transcript>: That's an array primitive.

03:23:29
<transcript>: group

03:23:31
structuredchris: do you do that using a reducer?

03:23:31
<transcript>: Group it is.

03:23:31
<transcript>: what

03:23:32
<transcript>: What.

03:23:32
<transcript>: oh

03:23:35
<transcript>: Oh, this experimental.

03:23:38
<transcript>: Is that is that just for using reduced.

03:23:41
<transcript>: Should I just be using reduce.

03:23:41
<transcript>: is that how i

03:23:43
<transcript>: Is that how I would group.

03:23:44
m2devdotnet: I don't think its an "extension" method, i think you have to do `groupBy(...)`

03:23:47
<transcript>: Use My reducer comac.

03:23:47
<transcript>: so

03:23:49
<transcript>: So cumulator plus current value.

03:23:52
<transcript>: Oh, so I could create, like, a map.

03:23:54
sakemitchy: There is  proposal  in tc39 / proposal-array-grouping

03:23:58
<transcript>: I don't think it's an extension method. I think you have to do group by Oh.

03:24:04
<transcript>: So they're is this proposal? Welcome to chat into dev. Net.

03:24:04
<transcript>: and

03:24:05
<transcript>: And also.

03:24:07
<transcript>: Welcome.

03:24:10
thdxr: I use remeda for all of these things

03:24:14
<transcript>: Saki mitchi a proposal in tc 39. Is that what I just had pulled up? I think we just had that pulled up.

03:24:15
thdxr: I hate writing reduces that do grouping

03:24:18
<transcript>: A group. By proposal. I've lost it.

03:24:18
<transcript>: it

03:24:20
<transcript>: It's gone now.

03:24:20
<transcript>: okay

03:24:24
<transcript>: Okay. So. Yeah. Here we go. Prototype group.

03:24:27
thdxr: remeda groupBy + mapValues is very good

03:24:29
<transcript>: So we could use a reduceDr you hate writing. Reducers that do grouping.

03:24:29
<transcript>: you do

03:24:31
<transcript>: You do ramita. What's your.

03:24:38
<transcript>: Meeta what's? Ramita. Ramita. Someone else said that earlier. I'm learning something new today.

03:24:43
<transcript>: Me to Jays the first data first and data last utility library design especially for typescript.

03:24:45
<transcript>: Oh, that sounds fun.

03:24:48
<transcript>: What's data first and data last.

03:24:53
<transcript>: Is this fun? I don't know. Am I gonna have fun with this.

03:24:54
vapor__dev: "someone else" ooof

03:24:56
<transcript>: R pipe.

03:24:58
glamshatterskull: LUL

03:24:59
zachrip: don't do it

03:25:00
<transcript>: Am I gonna have fun with this.

03:25:00
<transcript>: users

03:25:04
structuredchris: i use a bit of lodash, is remeda similar?

03:25:04
<transcript>: Users are filter our group by.

03:25:06
<transcript>: Alan is here.

03:25:09
glamshatterskull: sounds fun... sees example... maybe not

03:25:09
m2devdotnet: Does your camera change itself?

03:25:11
<transcript>: Welcome, Alan. I'm gonna do something. Hang on.

03:25:11
<transcript>: mod

03:25:17
<transcript>: Mod out of the making to me, I've been meaning to make you a mod for ever and you are now mod.

03:25:20
<transcript>: modern

03:25:20
<transcript>: modern ramit

03:25:24
<transcript>: Modern ramita group by plus map values is very good.

03:25:25
thdxr: it's the same as lodash but it treeshakes better and had better ts support

03:25:26
<transcript>: Don't do it since zach, don't do it.

03:25:27
stroopwafel26: vapor_mod!

03:25:28
fragaverage: Hell yeah, welcome to the cool kids club @vapor__dev

03:25:29
imshootex: @structuredchris ye

03:25:29
<transcript>: It looks like functional programming.

03:25:34
<transcript>: That sounds fun. Sees example. Maybe not. Yeah.

03:25:34
<transcript>: in two

03:25:38
<transcript>: In two dev, does my camera changes itself? Yeah, I've got like.

03:25:38
<transcript>: an

03:25:39
<transcript>: An.

03:25:39
<transcript>: just a

03:25:50
<transcript>: Just a timer this randomly, like switches over to another camera. Okay, just to like, make things up. Yeah, same as Low Dash, but it tree shakes better and had better ts support. Okay.

03:25:54
<transcript>: Welcome to the Cool Kids club.

03:26:00
<transcript>: Allen is mod. And then he's never said anything since he just he just bounced.

03:26:03
overra_dev: lol

03:26:03
<transcript>: Someone else.

03:26:07
<transcript>: Was it you, Alan? Did you say that earlier.

03:26:11
<transcript>: Was that you that said that I'm so sorry.

03:26:19
<transcript>: Alan. I didn't know you said something about ramita. I'm scrolling now. Oh, he sure did. Is this, you know.

03:26:20
thdxr: don't feel bad, I'm the one who showed him remeda

03:26:28
vapor__dev: this is the most emotional day of my life

03:26:28
thdxr: I hate alan

03:26:30
<transcript>: Why do I hate Alan? I don't. I love Alan. Alan is one of my few real life friends. Don't feel bad. I'm the one who showed him.

03:26:41
<transcript>: Oh, Alan, this is my most emotional day of my life. It's a roller coaster, right? I just. I kind of, like threw you down and then picked you up with the mod.

03:26:44
<transcript>: Dak Tape, Allen.

03:26:46
<transcript>: Okay.

03:26:46
<transcript>: run

03:26:50
vapor__dev: life is a highway and im gonna ride all night long brother

03:26:51
<transcript>: Runa our pipe users. Should I do this? I feel like I'm gonna regret this.

03:26:55
<transcript>: I don't know. Like I'm gonna regret it.

03:26:59
<transcript>: Life is the Highway.

03:27:05
<transcript>: That's funny. Okay. Should I just write JavaScript? Maybe at the other day I should just write JavaScript.

03:27:05
structuredchris: wait only for the night?

03:27:06
zachrip: overkill

03:27:10
<transcript>: So I would do this. How would I do this? Let's see how bad it is. Overkill. I agree.

03:27:16
<transcript>: Plays Box Score data.

03:27:16
<transcript>: scoring summary

03:27:18
<transcript>: Scoring summary.

03:27:22
<transcript>: Map? No.

03:27:28
zachrip: just let copilot write it

03:27:29
<transcript>: I do feel like this would be an opportunity for reduce.

03:27:29
<transcript>: who hates

03:27:31
<transcript>: Who hates if I reduce here.

03:27:34
<transcript>: Let copilot ride it. That's a good call.

03:27:34
<transcript>: i don't know

03:27:36
<transcript>: I don't know what the robots take over.

03:27:37
thdxr: you need to do a reduce

03:27:38
mecoupz: will the viewer count drop when he starts with javascript? lol

03:27:39
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:27:42
<transcript>: Function that takes.

03:27:47
<transcript>: The Scoring summary.

03:27:47
<transcript>: and

03:27:48
<transcript>: And.

03:27:53
vapor__dev: @thdxr true

03:27:53
overra_dev: robot take the wheel

03:27:53
<transcript>: Grits.

03:27:54
thdxr: tell chatgpt

03:28:02
<transcript>: The items by frames. I don't know.

03:28:08
<transcript>: Write it for me.

03:28:10
<transcript>: Did it work.

03:28:10
<transcript>: oh my goodness

03:28:17
<transcript>: Oh, my goodness, did it work? I gotta learn to use copilot more group by frames? Frames? Plays Where's plays? There's no plays.

03:28:17
<transcript>: group

03:28:21
<transcript>: Group plays frame a frame Cost plays in frame? I'm so confused.

03:28:22
thdxr: no that didn't work lol

03:28:26
<transcript>: Parameter P filter. It's not typescript.

03:28:26
<transcript>: that didn't

03:28:32
<transcript>: That didn't work. Okay. Okay. It didn't work. We tried.

03:28:32
<transcript>: i can't even delete

03:28:33
<transcript>: I can't even delete it.

03:28:36
<transcript>: And even delete it.

03:28:36
<transcript>: why am i

03:28:39
<transcript>: Why am I so indecisive here.

03:28:39
<transcript>: tell

03:28:41
<transcript>: Tell that Chetchy BT.

03:28:47
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah. You know what? I can here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna tell Chat gvt to rewrite this.

03:28:47
glamshatterskull: new bing

03:28:48
<transcript>: Okay.

03:28:54
<transcript>: Like this. Watch this.

03:28:57
<transcript>: Chat.

03:29:03
<transcript>: Okay.

03:29:04
thdxr: or you could just copy paste that code

03:29:05
<transcript>: Don't steal my password people.

03:29:08
<transcript>: Stop it.

03:29:08
<transcript>: okay

03:29:09
<transcript>: Okay.

03:29:15
<transcript>: I don't know if it's gonna have enough context, but you could just copy paste that code.

03:29:20
<transcript>: I'm not gonna introduce low show. That's the point I want to.

03:29:20
<transcript>: rewrite

03:29:22
glamshatterskull: omg my password is also  ***********

03:29:23
<transcript>: Rewrite this code below.

03:29:26
<transcript>: Using.

03:29:26
<transcript>: vanilla

03:29:27
<transcript>: Vanilla.

03:29:27
<transcript>: javascript

03:29:27
zachrip: give that code to copilot

03:29:29
<transcript>: Javascript.

03:29:29
<transcript>: type

03:29:29
maleero: Adam is a master at leaking info. LUL

03:29:30
<transcript>: Type script.

03:29:33
<transcript>: Instead of low dash.

03:29:38
<transcript>: Come on, now, let's do it.

03:29:38
<transcript>: do it

03:29:39
<transcript>: Do it.

03:29:44
<transcript>: I'm a master at leaking info. Did I? Did I link something? Oh, boy.

03:29:47
<transcript>: Your password is awesome. Stars.

03:29:47
<transcript>: okay

03:29:48
mecoupz: compare the response to gpt-4 too

03:29:52
<transcript>: Okay, what do we got here? Get frame, get frame type. Create frames.

03:29:57
<transcript>: Whew. I see why they use low dash goodness.

03:29:58
thdxr: I don't use a lot of libs but these types of map, group, sort, etc comes up enough that I use a library for it

03:29:59
<transcript>: Are you seeing.

03:30:00
thdxr: because js stdlib is bad

03:30:02
kiwifromearth: kiwitime kiwilime

03:30:08
<transcript>: This is really bad. Okay.

03:30:12
<transcript>: We're gonna use.

03:30:12
<transcript>: ramita

03:30:13
glamshatterskull: chatgpt uses a moonlander

03:30:14
<transcript>: Ramita.

03:30:14
<transcript>: we

03:30:16
thdxr: lol it's definitely not that complicated

03:30:17
zachrip: copilot vs chatgpt

03:30:18
<transcript>: We're gonna use ramita because I don't want to write all that. I just feel like, no.

03:30:23
maleero: I didn't see what you were talking about. I only heard you say "don't steal my password" But you've leaked stuff in the past lol

03:30:25
<transcript>: It's not that complicated. Okay, so, Chad, you see, misunderstood. I don't want to even read that to understand it.

03:30:25
zachrip: you don't need all of that

03:30:29
thdxr: they rewrote the lodash functions

03:30:30
<transcript>: Let's just do ramita. Let's do the ramita thing, I guess. I guess.

03:30:30
<transcript>: kiwi

03:30:32
<transcript>: Kiwi time Kiwi's back.

03:30:36
imshootex: LUL

03:30:44
<transcript>: Kiwi is back. Compare the response to gpt four. Oh, I didn't use gpt four, did I do? I used gpt-3 like a dummy. I sure did.

03:30:44
<transcript>: let's

03:30:49
<transcript>: Let's do let's do the same question this time with a gpt four.

03:30:52
<transcript>: What was I think.

03:30:52
<transcript>: what was

03:30:53
structuredchris: lol tbh dont know exactly what you're doing but could you do multiple vars with different .filter() conditions on them to divide an array of element into groups

03:30:54
<transcript>: What was I thinking.

03:30:58
<transcript>: For that follow. Saki.

03:31:06
<transcript>: And all in these are and hazard high. I appreciate your follows. Thank you so much.

03:31:06
<transcript>: i appreciate

<transcript>: To be honest, I don't know exactly what you're doing, but could you do multiple bars with different filter conditions.

03:31:23
<transcript>: to divide

03:31:28
<transcript>: To divide an array of elements into groups. I think that's the approach I was going to take.

03:31:32
<transcript>: I have leaked stuff malio it's true.

<transcript>: Did this get better? I feel still pretty bad.

03:32:07
<transcript>: Group by So we're riding our own group? I if I'm gonna ride it, I'm gonna use a library.

03:32:07
<transcript>: i'm just gonna use

03:32:09
imshootex: oh my god he knows my name

03:32:11
thdxr: no it keeps rewriting lodash for you

03:32:17
<transcript>: I'm just gonna use a library. Create frames. Let's just do this. Ramita. How do I install roomita? It keeps right rewriting loadash for me. Exactly.

03:32:23
<transcript>: I know your name, shoot. X. Of course I know your name.

03:32:23
<transcript>: so we're gonna

03:32:27
<transcript>: So we're gonna add let's see, push the www.

03:32:27
<transcript>: we're gonna

03:32:28
<transcript>: We're gonna do.

03:32:28
<transcript>: what

03:32:29
thdxr: you can probably copy paste the old code and it'll work with remeda

03:32:33
<transcript>: What disabling get integration. I don't know how to get integration.

03:32:33
<transcript>: copy past

03:32:37
<transcript>: Copy, paste the old code and it'll work with romina. Okay.

03:32:37
<transcript>: so

03:32:40
<transcript>: So we want to do pmpm.

03:32:40
<transcript>: add

03:32:42
<transcript>: Add Ramita.

03:32:45
<transcript>: Is it just Ramita.

03:32:49
<transcript>: Yeah. Ramita. Okay.

03:32:53
livemahs: good morning adam, a bit late but good to see everyone!

03:32:54
<transcript>: And then over here.

03:32:54
<transcript>: we're

03:32:56
<transcript>: We're gonna.

03:33:00
<transcript>: Good morning. Live. Maz.

03:33:00
<transcript>: bit

03:33:02
<transcript>: Bit late. That's alright.

03:33:02
<transcript>: so

03:33:07
<transcript>: So let's import what from Ramita, Ramita.

03:33:10
<transcript>: I guess we're gonna find out.

03:33:18
thdxr: pipe, map, groupby

03:33:19
<transcript>: Are. So you just call it R. I gotta import all as R from armeda. Okay.

03:33:23
<transcript>: Treeshaking supported.

03:33:23
thdxr: copy paste the old code

03:33:27
thdxr: I don't import as R, looks weird

03:33:31
<transcript>: Map group by copy paste field code. Okay, let's do it.

03:33:35
<transcript>: Copy paste the old code frame type. I guess I need to do this.

03:33:38
<transcript>: I guess I need to do this.

03:33:49
<transcript>: Frame type. What is what.

03:33:49
<transcript>: sample

03:33:50
<transcript>: Sample play.

03:33:54
<transcript>: I was just saying, the first one.

03:34:02
<transcript>: What is the type of a play.

03:34:06
<transcript>: It's this type. I need to actually go in here.

03:34:10
<transcript>: So these are gonna be different for each sport.

03:34:22
<transcript>: I agree that the R thing looks weird. Dax, I'm gonna change that. These are gonna be different per sport. I don't love that. You know what? No, we're not doing that. Not that way. Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. We're doing a different way.

03:34:22
<transcript>: we're gonna do it

03:34:26
<transcript>: We're gonna do it still using ramita. I just mean, like, we're not gonna do.

03:34:26
<transcript>: generic

03:34:28
<transcript>: Generic purse sport.

03:34:28
<transcript>: we're gonna

03:34:30
<transcript>: We're gonna say, Create frames.

03:34:34
<transcript>: So let's copy this code.

03:34:38
<transcript>: Okay.

03:34:38
<transcript>: create fr

03:34:45
<transcript>: Create frames. We're gonna delete that. So we're just going to import you're saying we can just import pipe from Ramita.

03:34:49
thdxr: yep

03:34:55
<transcript>: Type.

03:34:57
<transcript>: And group by.

03:35:01
<transcript>: And map.

03:35:01
<transcript>: this special

03:35:03
<transcript>: This special map to.

03:35:09
<transcript>: Copy. Paste your code. I don't. Yep. Okay.

03:35:09
<transcript>: the two

03:35:11
<transcript>: The 216 arguments.

03:35:14
<transcript>: But got one.

03:35:17
thdxr: I think pipe doesn't need an array around it

03:35:18
<transcript>: Okay, let's look at some roomita. Docs.

03:35:20
<transcript>: Low dash.

03:35:23
<transcript>: So Pick is expecting.

03:35:29
<transcript>: You have to pass the object pipe doesn't need an array around it. Okay.

03:35:36
<transcript>: So group by.

03:35:36
<transcript>: frank

03:35:37
<transcript>: Frank.

03:35:42
<transcript>: I'm gonna get the frame type.

03:35:42
<transcript>: group

03:35:44
thdxr: put frameType as the first arg

03:35:45
<transcript>: Group by just quarter.

03:35:47
<transcript>: Order.

03:35:48
thdxr: er nvm

03:35:49
<transcript>: Quarter.

03:35:52
<transcript>: What.

03:35:52
<transcript>: but frame type

03:35:52
thdxr: what's the input array?

03:35:54
<transcript>: But frame type is the first Arg.

03:35:55
thdxr: that needs to be the first arg

03:35:58
<transcript>: String is not a signable.

03:36:07
<transcript>: Used to be the first arc. What's the input array? It's a oh. So the first Arg of pipe needs to be the.

03:36:07
<transcript>: this needs

03:36:08
<transcript>: This needs to be placed.

03:36:10
imshootex: i'm currently reviewing a 680 files pr and your thocky keyboard makes me not lose my mind

03:36:18
thdxr: yeaha nd groupBy takes a function

03:36:26
<transcript>: Are you telling me right now, please? And then group by group. I take the function of that makes sense. Yeah. This is kind of weird that it's just like a string.

03:36:32
<transcript>: Group by quarter.

03:36:36
<transcript>: How this.

03:36:43
<transcript>: Fellow is Super Sam.

03:36:47
thdxr: can you delete the map section temporarily

03:36:48
<transcript>: Appreciate that. Follow super saiyan. So what's wrong with this axe.

03:36:48
<transcript>: i'm currently

03:36:51
<transcript>: I'm currently reviewing a 685.

03:36:58
<transcript>: 680 file PR and your socky keyboard makes me not lose my mind I'm so glad shoot X, shoot X.

03:37:01
<transcript>: Twitter thing was fun. I enjoyed.

03:37:01
<transcript>: that experience

03:37:02
<transcript>: That experience.

03:37:05
<transcript>: That was fun.

03:37:09
thdxr: what type is quarter also

03:37:10
<transcript>: Goodbye. Can you delete the map section temporarily? Oh, Yeah.

03:37:16
<transcript>: So group by P. Okay, so that works.

03:37:16
<transcript>: but then we

03:37:19
<transcript>: But then we need to map.

03:37:23
<transcript>: I don't understand. What that thing. Map.

03:37:26
<transcript>: P.

03:37:30
imshootex: glad you liked it :D

03:37:32
<transcript>: And what are they doing here? They're getting time. But I don't see where they use time.

03:37:37
<transcript>: And they're just adding the logo. You are to the plays.

03:37:41
<transcript>: Do I even need to do that? I don't need to do that.

03:37:46
<transcript>: What type is quarter? It's a.

03:37:48
<transcript>: String.

03:37:50
strum355: i hear prime has choice words for rxjs

03:37:51
thdxr: you probably want to use `mapValues` to iterate through each group

03:37:58
<transcript>: I think this is good enough. This is going to be shaped. What? Oh, I love good typescript. We have record property key.

03:38:04
<transcript>: Which is a string, and then it has all the items in it. Ooh, I love that.

03:38:04
<transcript>: yes

03:38:05
<transcript>: Yes.

03:38:05
<transcript>: if i just do

03:38:08
<transcript>: If I just do this console.

03:38:08
<transcript>: log

03:38:09
<transcript>: Log.

03:38:09
<transcript>: create

03:38:11
<transcript>: Create frame.

03:38:14
<transcript>: That should just be called frames. Right.

03:38:17
<transcript>: Frames.

03:38:22
<transcript>: What does that look like.

03:38:24
thdxr: if you need to do stuff to them

03:38:25
<transcript>: Yeah. First quarter. No.

03:38:25
<transcript>: that's

03:38:26
<transcript>: That's not what it's not.

03:38:26
<transcript>: what i

03:38:28
<transcript>: What I want.

03:38:33
<transcript>: Wait.

03:38:34
thdxr: tldr this should just be built into js

03:38:35
<transcript>: What.

03:38:39
<transcript>: I don't think it actually updated yet.

03:38:47
<transcript>: Did I kill? But now there we go? Yeah? Fourth quarter. And that has all of them? Yeah, yeah? This is what I want.

03:38:47
<transcript>: this is

03:38:49
<transcript>: This is what I want.

03:38:55
<transcript>: Probably want to use map values to iterate through each group.

03:39:06
<transcript>: Strum. Welcome to Chat. I hear prime has choice words for rxjs. I've never used rxjs. What is rxjs? Reactive? Something.

03:39:07
thdxr: this isn't rxjs!

03:39:11
thdxr: it looks like it though

03:39:12
sockthedev: lol

03:39:19
strum355: oh i thought this was rxjs, with pipe n all

03:39:21
<transcript>: I did like it. Shoot X. Oh, well, see, you probably want to use map values if you need to do stuff to them. Tlrdr this should just be built into js. This is an rxjs. Looks like it though. I think I just want to group by and now we have group by.

03:39:21
<transcript>: do i have to actually

03:39:24
<transcript>: Do I have to actually pipe if I'm just doing one thing.

03:39:24
<transcript>: can frames

03:39:27
<transcript>: Can frames just be.

03:39:29
<transcript>: Group by.

03:39:30
thdxr: nah you don't need pipe

03:39:31
<transcript>: Telling that.

03:39:35
sockthedev: prime def glows with love for rxjs

03:39:35
<transcript>: I think that's all I need. I'm not actually doing the mapping thing.

03:39:36
thdxr: can use just groupby and pass it in

03:39:38
<transcript>: Since I have all my frames like that.

03:39:41
<transcript>: And down here, I can actually start working with them.

03:39:43
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:39:56
<transcript>: Who's this? Oh, that's all. That okay. Yeah. Never mind.

03:39:59
<transcript>: So all of that gets collapsed.

03:40:00
strum355: very crisp camera and keyboard sound

03:40:05
<transcript>: Abs Tab Panel summary. Okay, here we are. So box for summary. So this is where we're gonna do.

03:40:06
imshootex: pipe is a fp thing, right?

03:40:09
<transcript>: A frames map. Okay.

03:40:14
<transcript>: Black columns, more specifically, quarters.

03:40:27
sockthedev: i'm looking forward to the pipe operator coming to js

03:40:32
thdxr: you can't map frames since it's an object

03:40:33
sockthedev: love the placeholder value thing

03:40:35
<transcript>: Awesome.

03:40:40
<transcript>: Orders, map, quarters, and then.

03:40:46
oleksii_lisovyi: Heyo Adam and chat o/

03:40:54
<transcript>: What's wrong with that fresh is not callible.

03:41:00
<transcript>: Alexis here. Welcome, alexi. Can't map frame, since it's an object.

03:41:00
<transcript>: i've been to that

03:41:02
<transcript>: I've been to that.

03:41:02
<transcript>: quarters

03:41:03
<transcript>: Quarters.

03:41:06
<transcript>: Well, what can I do with it, then.

03:41:09
<transcript>: How can I get all the items in it.

03:41:19
<transcript>: How can I How can I do the thing.

03:41:22
<transcript>: Looking forward to the pipeline coming to JS.

03:41:25
thdxr: Object.values?

03:41:27
<transcript>: Strum, very crisp camera and keyboard sound. Thank you so much.

03:41:31
<transcript>: Can just use groupe and pass it in.

03:41:31
<transcript>: yeah

03:41:37
<transcript>: Yeah, but how object of values. Are you kidding me? I guess I should have done that up here.

03:41:42
<transcript>: I do need the.

03:41:43
oleksii_lisovyi: Wanna guess what “hot weekend” mean?

03:41:43
thdxr: I don't get what exactly you want out

03:41:48
<transcript>: Object that values.

03:41:53
<transcript>: What is the shape of this thing? Well, now it's gonna be something different.

03:41:55
<transcript>: On empty array.

03:41:59
<transcript>: Yeah, I just need them grouped into yeah, yeah, that's fine, right.

03:42:01
thdxr: it's an array of arrays now

03:42:01
<transcript>: Can I actually iterate on this thing now.

03:42:01
<transcript>: you don't

03:42:08
<transcript>: You don't know what I went out. I don't either. Deck. That's why you don't know. But I want to be able to build up this thing right here.

03:42:09
<transcript>: And.

03:42:09
<transcript>: start to do that

03:42:11
<transcript>: Start to do that.

03:42:17
<transcript>: Wait a minute. Where's the first quarter part.

03:42:22
<transcript>: I I messed up.

03:42:24
<transcript>: Mess up.

03:42:30
thdxr: you need 2 loops don't you

03:42:30
<transcript>: So We're gonna We're gonna redo this.

03:42:30
<transcript>: this part

03:42:31
<transcript>: This part.

03:42:35
<transcript>: This is not good.

03:42:38
<transcript>: We're gonna delete this.

03:42:42
<transcript>: First quarter. Wait a minute, wait a minute.

03:42:43
thdxr: first iterate over each quarter then iterate through each play in each quarter

03:42:44
<transcript>: What.

03:42:44
oleksii_lisovyi: That’s laying in bed with high temperature LOL

03:42:47
<transcript>: Is happening.

03:42:52
<transcript>: Need to be able to build up one of these with each group so first quarter team.

03:42:52
<transcript>: and

03:42:59
<transcript>: And then the stuff. Each item. Yeah. Yeah. Iterate over each quarter than iterate through each play in each quarter. Yes.

03:43:05
<transcript>: Exactly. You need two loops. Yes, it's an array of arrays now. Okay, that's good.

03:43:09
<transcript>: That's good if it's an array of arrays.

03:43:13
<transcript>: So for each quarter.

03:43:17
<transcript>: We're going to just delete this. I'm gonna put this one in here.

03:43:23
<transcript>: Nope.

03:43:28
thdxr: Object.entries might be better

03:43:28
<transcript>: This right here is gonna go in here, okay.

03:43:37
<transcript>: So for each quarter we render where is it going? What is happening? Exactly what happened on the last one.

03:43:37
<transcript>: the thing

03:43:39
<transcript>: The thing disappeared.

03:43:42
oleksii_lisovyi: Array of arrays sounds so familiar for PHP dev

03:43:45
<transcript>: Like, Where is that going.

03:43:48
thdxr: that's not a quarter you're getting, you're getting a list of plays.  But you can get the quarter with `plays[0].quarter`

03:43:51
<transcript>: I don't understand.

03:43:55
<transcript>: Am I getting too much.

03:43:55
<transcript>: am i scooping

03:43:58
thdxr: Object.entries gives you the quarter directly

03:43:58
<transcript>: Am I scooping up too much of the Dom.

03:43:58
<transcript>: or

03:44:03
<transcript>: Or too much of the markup. Nick Bolton. Where's the We're second quarter.

03:44:06
<transcript>: Second quarter.

03:44:10
<transcript>: Second quarter, right there. What in the world is happening.

03:44:10
<transcript>: what

03:44:12
<transcript>: What in the world.

03:44:12
<transcript>: is happening

03:44:14
<transcript>: Is happening.

03:44:18
<transcript>: Okay, I have some markup.

03:44:18
<transcript>: all

03:44:20
<transcript>: All of this markup.

03:44:20
<transcript>: like

03:44:22
<transcript>: Like. Okay.

03:44:26
<transcript>: What in the world.

03:44:26
<transcript>: is happening

03:44:27
<transcript>: Is happening.

03:44:32
<transcript>: Like I'm I crazy.

03:44:32
<transcript>: i'll see what

03:44:34
<transcript>: I'll see what it did.

03:44:39
<transcript>: I'm just. I'm straightening this out. Because now I'm bothering.

03:44:39
<transcript>: the way it forms

03:44:40
<transcript>: The way it forms.

03:44:42
<transcript>: Okay.

03:44:42
<transcript>: this

03:44:44
<transcript>: This Div.

03:44:47
<transcript>: Right here.

03:44:49
<transcript>: This whole dis.

03:44:50
<transcript>: displap that one

03:44:50
<transcript>: Displap that one.

03:44:54
<transcript>: Collapse. No, it's all this.

03:44:59
<transcript>: I'm not gonna collapse it this time because I feel like it's something to do with.

03:44:59
<transcript>: slowly

03:45:00
<transcript>: Slowly.

03:45:01
nate_codes: Did you install poltergeist.nvim?

03:45:04
<transcript>: Copy all of this.

03:45:06
<transcript>: Delete.

03:45:06
<transcript>: and paste

03:45:08
<transcript>: And paste.

03:45:08
<transcript>: there it is

03:45:09
bu5ygiraffe: wouldn't have that problem in vs code :)

03:45:09
<transcript>: There it is.

03:45:14
<transcript>: We're good. That was so weird.

03:45:17
<transcript>: Did you install poltergeist.

03:45:17
<transcript>: that a thing because

03:45:21
<transcript>: That a thing. Because I feel like I might have a ghost in here.

03:45:21
<transcript>: entries my

03:45:23
<transcript>: Entries my better.

03:45:29
<transcript>: I don't know who what hot weekend you had a hot weekend.

03:45:29
<transcript>: laying

03:45:33
<transcript>: Laying in bed with the temperature. That's not good. Alexey.

03:45:40
<transcript>: Object entries might be better array of arrays sounds so familiar.

03:45:46
<transcript>: You're getting a list of plays, but I can just get the court. Yeah. I was gonna just do that next. I'm just gonna take the first one.

03:45:50
<transcript>: I was just gonna get the first one. I guess entries might be better. I think you're ready.

03:45:57
<transcript>: It's a little nicer looking, maybe.

03:46:03
<transcript>: String. And in the array. Yeah.

03:46:07
<transcript>: Wait. It's.

03:46:11
<transcript>: Like a tuple kind of like a string.

03:46:14
<transcript>: So then here.

03:46:14
<transcript>: here

03:46:17
<transcript>: Here we are a quarter.

03:46:21
<transcript>: Is that thing I'm gonna call. I'm gonna do this.

03:46:27
<transcript>: And this is gonna be the Quarter, and this is gonna be the place.

03:46:30
<transcript>: Like that.

03:46:35
<transcript>: Quarter should be a string, and plays should be that.

03:46:38
<transcript>: So we render the quarter right here.

03:46:40
<transcript>: Quarter.

03:46:43
<transcript>: And then.

03:46:45
<transcript>: Teams.

03:46:52

<transcript>: Home.

03:47:16
<transcript>: Okay. Did we get that much? I'm guess if I'll find that here in SEC and then down here.

03:47:19
<transcript>: These are actual.

03:47:19
<transcript>: plays

03:47:21
<transcript>: Plays? So we're gonna do.

<transcript>: Plays.

03:47:23
<transcript>: map

03:47:25
<transcript>: Map, Yes.

03:47:31
<transcript>: And then we just delete a whole tag like this.

03:47:36
<transcript>: Right.

03:47:36
<transcript>: then

03:47:38
<transcript>: Then delete all of this.

03:47:41
imshootex: @thdxr are you also working on statmuse?

03:47:44
<transcript>: And then I'm going to delete. All of this is the fourth quarter.

03:47:55
<transcript>: Okay. Feels good. I just got to get this. So the image is a little weird. I got to get that from something.

03:47:55

03:52:44
vapor__dev: he's in your mainframe!!!

03:52:53

03:53:05

03:53:11
imshootex: yes, you need undotree

03:53:12
thdxr: the camera didn't even zoom

03:53:12
thdxr: ol

03:53:18
loliser: I was just about to link undotree. would save you here

03:53:21

03:53:22
nate_codes: Somebody put a troll bind in your conf

03:53:26
<transcript>: It won't save me. Retroactively, will it.

03:53:33

03:53:49
imshootex: it might still help, i think?

03:53:53
<transcript>: I guess it builds character. Okay. So it's not that many of them, but still.

03:53:54
nate_codes: Could watch your stream in slow mo to find it

03:53:55
<transcript>: It might still help.

03:53:55
<transcript>: i don't

03:53:57
<transcript>: I don't know.

03:54:00
<transcript>: Watch my stream and slow modify.

03:54:08

03:54:08

03:54:12

03:54:33
<transcript>: Here we go. Blame. Blame the lsp. Yes, right. I know I didn't go down there and just randomly start deleting stuff like.

03:54:41
<transcript>: Penalty's rushing attempts. And where are we at rushing attempts is good. And then I have to add yards per rush.

03:54:45
<transcript>: This is so annoying. Yards per rush.

03:54:51
<transcript>: Hey, remember, like an hour ago when I did this already? Yeah, that was fun.

03:54:53
<transcript>: Card per rush.

03:54:56
<transcript>: Brushing yards.

03:55:00

03:56:18

03:56:18
<transcript>: not

03:56:38
<transcript>: Not the real time set, the realtime stats or whatever. But there's so much data we do not have going back further that someone could find it's all five. It's like a treasure Hunt. Just go back and find old newspapers, things like that to get old box scores. But if we open source it and we made it where people contribute data, I think we'd have a much better data picture like it would look better.

03:56:52
<transcript>: What it took me so on to realize your follow alert is from trivia Crack. It's not actually. Yeah, it's it's from my theme song. My theme music, which is by a brake master cylinder.

<transcript>: Lexi, wait, but isn't there a way to get back to the previous file state? I had done a bunch of work, alexi, and I don't have undue tree. If I had undo tree, I think that's what you're talking about.

03:58:29
<transcript>: if i had

03:58:32
<transcript>: If I had undutrie, I could have gotten back to it.

03:58:32

03:59:13

03:59:29
<transcript>: but

03:59:34
<transcript>: But if you if you want to call this a flow state, I don't want to break it, you know, keep going.

03:59:40
<transcript>: Grouping home and away team stats and then mapping over. Remove the tedious work here.

03:59:40
<transcript>: i see you've done it

03:59:43
<transcript>: I see you've done it already. Yeah, yeah, I think.

03:59:45

03:59:45
<transcript>: end this

03:59:51
<transcript>: End this proverbial cap. But this is the way I did it. And now.

03:59:56

04:00:14
<transcript>: mlbage issues

04:00:23
<transcript>: Mlbage issues leg ask. Okay. So there's an issue with that page. Fine. I think with the follow T chum flay. So we're gonna do MLB next.

04:00:23
<transcript>: and to do

04:00:26
<transcript>: And to do this one, I'm actually gonna go up here.

04:00:32

04:00:32
<transcript>: didn't

04:00:33
<transcript>: Didn't use map either.

04:00:39

<transcript>: Mlb.

04:00:52
<transcript>: box score

04:00:54
<transcript>: Box score.

04:00:57

<transcript>: Bbox score, cool.

04:01:04
zxshan: I enjoyed my stay CorgiDerp <3

04:01:04
<transcript>: So it doesn't have a scoring summary.

04:01:06
<transcript>: It's a called.

04:01:10
<transcript>: Summary.

04:01:10
<transcript>: oh

04:01:14
<transcript>: Oh, oh, because this one still has MBA.

04:01:17
<transcript>: Yeah. So that's gonna be some more work, isn't it.

04:01:20
<transcript>: Let's see how quickly I can do this.

04:01:20
<transcript>: camera

04:01:21
<transcript>: Camera.

04:01:26
<transcript>: Oh, what do you. What? No. Why did you need my what.

04:01:31
<transcript>: Did you see that.

04:01:35
<transcript>: Happened.

04:01:49
<transcript>: Let's just go up here and go to definite. There we go. Okay. Mlb is gonna be MLB visual. I don't know what happens at telescope all of a sudden. So we're gonna copy.

04:01:50
mecoupz: dax you are a bad hacker. you showed him a prompt for camera access

04:01:53
<transcript>: Nfl Visual. We're gonna call it.

04:01:58
<transcript>: Mlb, Visual, MLB, Visual, MLB.

04:02:01
<transcript>: And there'll be historical box score.

04:02:01
<transcript>: which i need

04:02:03
<transcript>: Which I need to go to.

04:02:07
<transcript>: We're gonna yank all of this.

04:02:11
<transcript>: Yank the block.

04:02:19
<transcript>: I want to just copy all that. Okay. This one.

04:02:23
<transcript>: Mlb MLB Historical Box for.

04:02:26
<transcript>: Just gonna have a very different shape, but we'll get there.

04:02:30
<transcript>: Okay. So let's assume we have that.

04:02:32
<transcript>: Then down here.

04:02:42
<transcript>: Where is it? Here? Mlb. The sorco Box for.

04:02:47
<transcript>: Mlb Visual. It's an MLB hustler box. Okay, just like that.

04:02:47
<transcript>: now i need to get

04:02:49
<transcript>: Now I need to get the data for this thing.

04:02:53
<transcript>: Let's see.

04:02:56
<transcript>: Flagger.

04:02:56
<transcript>: how do i want to do this

04:02:59
<transcript>: How do I want to do this? I guess. Just like this.

04:03:01
m2devdotnet: Maybe a stupid question... are you using Astro with dynamically fetched (API) data or is it still all server-generated?

04:03:04
<transcript>: Mlb Games Answer I need a game. Id.

04:03:04
<transcript>: ba

04:03:05
<transcript>: Ba.

04:03:12
<transcript>: The Baseball game.

04:03:17
<transcript>: Here we go.

04:03:21
<transcript>: That's not how I want to do it.

04:03:28
<transcript>: Scores. Here we go. Here's the baseball game path. We're gonna paste it in here.

04:03:39
<transcript>: Is that a struggle workflow state.

04:03:42
<transcript>: Yeah.

04:03:45
<transcript>: So I need to log.

04:03:49
<transcript>: login

04:03:50
<transcript>: Login.

04:03:53
<transcript>: Telescope is broken.

04:03:53
<transcript>: mlb

04:03:57
<transcript>: Mlb Box Score. We're gonna log console, log.

04:03:57
<transcript>: json

04:04:01
<transcript>: Json stringify data.

04:04:01
<transcript>: visual

04:04:02
<transcript>: Visual.

04:04:09
<transcript>: Remember? Is it summary? I don't know. We're just gonna do that. I'm fine. To.

04:04:18
<transcript>: Still rendered it Game ID 227105.

04:04:24
<transcript>: 227-10-5227.

04:04:24
<transcript>: one

04:04:27
<transcript>: 10, five. There it is. Execute.

04:04:30
<transcript>: And we're gonna download this thing.

04:04:33
<transcript>: Open it.

04:04:38
<transcript>: In what text, mate.

04:04:42
<transcript>: And it's not that thing or that thing.

04:04:42
<transcript>: stop that thing

04:04:46
<transcript>: Stop that thing. It's a detail. It's this right here.

04:04:50
<transcript>: I guess I could try to like, inspect.

04:04:54
<transcript>: Their smarter way to do this. Probably.

04:04:59
<transcript>: So in the historical box store we're gonna do.

04:05:02
<transcript>: This.

04:05:05
<transcript>: A lot of lines.

04:05:05
<transcript>: two thousand of them

04:05:06
<transcript>: 2000 of them.

04:05:10
dodolkecik: no MLS?

04:05:11
<transcript>: Number home team is gonna be an.

04:05:14
<transcript>: Team.

04:05:19
<transcript>: Emma, that one. Stats. Is this a grid? Now.

04:05:27
<transcript>: Mls. Not yet. No, no, we don't have soccer, and we're gonna do epl. We're gonna do European soccer.

04:05:27
<transcript>: probably

04:05:30
<transcript>: Probably before we do mls, honestly.

04:05:30
<transcript>: and we're

04:05:39
<transcript>: And we're gonna do IPL so cricut maybe a super question or using astro with dynamically Session api data or is it still all server generated? It is all server generated.

04:05:47
<transcript>: The api live at the server, so the server is fetching from another api of ours.

04:05:57
<transcript>: Dash. You're a bad hacker. You showed him a prompt for camera access. Yeah. Why am I getting all these props for access to stuff that I never wanted to give access to.

04:05:57
<transcript>: seven or thirty three

04:05:59
zappy_idk: Oh IPL :0

04:06:03
<transcript>: Seven or 33 lines. That's a lot of stuff. What do we have? Name, columns, rows. So this is a grid.

04:06:08
<transcript>: Gamera grid team is just a string.

04:06:11
<transcript>: Also a grid.

04:06:11
<transcript>: camera

04:06:13
zappy_idk: new IPL Season starting in 10 days

04:06:14
<transcript>: Camera, grid.

04:06:14
<transcript>: and how

04:06:16
<transcript>: And how to do those.

04:06:20
<transcript>: And then this one is a string.

04:06:20
<transcript>: this one

04:06:23
<transcript>: This one is a gamera grid.

04:06:23
<transcript>: as

04:06:26
<transcript>: As is this one? Okay.

04:06:34
<transcript>: Cool. So that's stats and then line score and scoring. Summary.

04:06:38
<transcript>: That's great summary is gonna look just like no. Snot. It's different.

04:06:38
<transcript>: it's different

04:06:40
<transcript>: It's different. It's string.

04:06:43
<transcript>: String.

04:06:43
<transcript>: string

04:06:44
<transcript>: String.

04:06:46
<transcript>: Number.

04:06:50
<transcript>: And then delete these.

04:06:55
<transcript>: Scrolling summary looks like that.

04:06:59
<transcript>: Just like that.

04:07:04
<transcript>: Type we're gonna put the top.

04:07:06
<transcript>: Historical.

04:07:08
<transcript>: Okay.

04:07:11
<transcript>: So we just have to line score now.

04:07:13
mecoupz: https://jsonhero.io

04:07:15
<transcript>: I think this is just a line score. Oh, no, this is just a.

04:07:18
<transcript>: Where are the.

04:07:22
<transcript>: Where are the Baseball stats.

04:07:22
<transcript>: they're not team stats

04:07:23
<transcript>: They're not Team stats.

04:07:26
<transcript>: This is just a gamera grid.

04:07:28
jiggaman98: I'm getting so much better at LeetCode, it's crazy!

04:07:30
<transcript>: There are no teamsats in baseball. Let's go over here.

04:07:33
<transcript>: Baseball game.

04:07:37
<transcript>: Summary and players that feels good.

04:07:37
<transcript>: feels good

04:07:38
<transcript>: Feels good.

04:07:38
<transcript>: base

04:07:40
<transcript>: Baseball so boring.

04:07:40
<transcript>: look at this

04:07:42
<transcript>: Look at this.

04:07:44
<transcript>: Score of 20.

04:07:48
<transcript>: But that was a fun one to watch. Jeez.

04:07:49
<transcript>: Okay.

04:07:49
<transcript>: so i

04:07:53
<transcript>: So I don't need to do the team sets thing. Cool.

04:07:53
<transcript>: cool

04:07:54
<transcript>: Cool.

04:08:05
<transcript>: Ipl new IPL season starting in ten days. Yeah, we won't have it ready for that. But we are gonna work on it. It's gonna be a thing that we add along with European soccer.

04:08:10
<transcript>: So let's go back to our MLB Box score.

04:08:13
<transcript>: And this should have a scoring summary. Now.

04:08:16
<transcript>: Right.

04:08:18
<transcript>: Yeah. Maybe.

04:08:22
<transcript>: So there's no home team staffers that will wait in stats. That's okay.

04:08:26
<transcript>: Quarter is now gonna be inning.

04:08:32
<transcript>: And let's just rename it from quarters to.

04:08:34
<transcript>: Innings.

04:08:39
<transcript>: To get real specific.

04:08:45
<transcript>: Okay. There is no. What is this? Box? Cord Data summary.

04:08:48
<transcript>: Is there no summary like that.

04:08:51
<transcript>: Oh, that's a different one.

04:08:53
<transcript>: What is that coming from.

04:08:55
mecoupz: at work i automated what adam has to go through that json thing. if you have a swagger api, openapi-generator can generate typescript types and api call wrappers

04:08:59
<transcript>: We're gonna just kind of collapse this one for now.

04:09:05
<transcript>: And then down here we have a summary, which is good. We don't have a team stat.

04:09:09
<transcript>: This one goes away Wait a minute.

04:09:12
<transcript>: Where's the player set so.

04:09:19
<transcript>: First players. That. Oh, my word. It did it again. What is going on with my Neil? Of him.

04:09:21
<transcript>: What is going on.

04:09:23
<transcript>: That's so annoying.

04:09:25
<transcript>: Like.

04:09:25
<transcript>: it's okay

04:09:31
<transcript>: It's okay. I can just copy it from another thing, but that's so annoying. Like, I don't understand what is happening.

04:09:39
<transcript>: So I commented that out.

04:09:44
<transcript>: We need to grab that from another, like, from NFL.

04:09:44
<transcript>: the

04:09:46
<transcript>: The player Stats one.

04:09:47
sockthedev: really selling neovim today

04:09:49
<transcript>: Oh, it's gone on here too.

04:09:53
<transcript>: Oh, my word.

04:09:58
<transcript>: Like that's a thing. Right? Team stats. And then player sets. Yeah.

04:10:00
mr_yan19: that's my problem with neovim, you loose so much otherwise productive time messing with setup

04:10:03
<transcript>: Unbelievable.

04:10:03
<transcript>: they delet

04:10:08
<transcript>: They deleted this from NFL, and then I pasted that over there. Yeah. Okay.

04:10:16
<transcript>: I want to import it. Come on. Just.

04:10:21
<transcript>: Be down here pretty quick, so I'm sorry to get frustrated.

04:10:22
mecoupz: its a feature of neovim. every 2 LoC you write, it deletes 1

04:10:24
<transcript>: Import grid from.

04:10:24
<transcript>: component

04:10:26
<transcript>: Components.

04:10:26
<transcript>: grid

04:10:28
<transcript>: Grid, Astro.

04:10:32
<transcript>: So we should have players that's back for football.

04:10:40
<transcript>: Put it in baseball.

04:10:49
<transcript>: You need to do the same.

04:10:52
<transcript>: Here. We need import.

04:10:55
<transcript>: Great.

04:10:55
<transcript>: astro

04:10:57
<transcript>: Astro sure.

04:11:05
<transcript>: What's wrong with this? We don't have player detail.

04:11:10
<transcript>: Is it line score.

04:11:20
<transcript>: There's some grids here somewhere.

04:11:22
<transcript>: Away team.

04:11:24
<transcript>: Just like that.

04:11:35
<transcript>: Waiting. There we go.

04:11:38
sockthedev: https://imgflip.com/i/7f5ton

04:11:45
<transcript>: What.

04:11:45
<transcript>: matters

04:11:46
<transcript>: Matters that.

04:11:48
<transcript>: Picture stats.

04:11:52
mecoupz: HAHAHAHA

04:11:55
<transcript>: What is? What's the deal here? Batters. Pitchers.

04:11:55
<transcript>: they're both grids

04:11:56
<transcript>: They're both grids.

04:11:56
<transcript>: so

04:12:06
<transcript>: So. Same same idea. I'm glad I didn't do this generic because these are actually different stats. Away team grids. It's not grids. It's.

04:12:11
<transcript>: Battersat.

04:12:17
<transcript>: These are two grids. Right.

04:12:18
mecoupz: the last door should've said watch.dev :D

04:12:23
<transcript>: This is gonna be boxcore Data, stats.

04:12:25
<transcript>: Awayteam.

04:12:29
<transcript>: Stats.

04:12:33
<transcript>: And itcher sad.

04:12:37
lord_guccif3r: @adamdotdev this is going to sound weird but it is so satisfying to hear your keyboard on my headphones, I can only imagine how it will sound in person

04:12:38
sockthedev: it's in the post, for sure :D

04:12:45
<transcript>: Away team turns into.

04:12:48

04:13:10
<transcript>: lord gucci

<transcript>: That's my problem with him. You lose so much. Otherwise productive time meting was set up. Yeah.

04:13:39
<transcript>: the

04:13:45
<transcript>: The positive case for it, Mr. Yann, is it's a good hobby? It's a fun hobby. Sometimes.

04:13:45
<transcript>: teach

04:13:49
<transcript>: Teacher that follow. I think I missed that earlier.

04:13:54
<transcript>: It's a feature of new event. Every two lines of code you ride it at least one.

04:14:00

04:14:12
<transcript>: Okay.

04:14:17
<transcript>: So we have our plays. Let's just see what this looks like. Now.

04:14:19
<transcript>: What it looks like.

04:14:19
<transcript>: we

04:14:24
<transcript>: We should have just a summary. Oh, I need to get rid of up here.

04:14:24
<transcript>: there's no

04:14:25
tchumflay: nah you got my follow king, btw the keyborard sound is great!

04:14:26
<transcript>: There's no team stats, right.

04:14:31
<transcript>: Summary and playerstapps.

04:14:35
<transcript>: Summary looks correctish.

04:14:38
<transcript>: Now let's just make sure.

04:14:42
<transcript>: Wait. What's? What's wrong with this? Oh, I don't have the thing yet.

04:14:42
<transcript>: i don't have this

04:14:44
<transcript>: I don't have this thing yet, but.

04:14:47
<transcript>: Home Run by bryce Harper.

04:14:52
<transcript>: Looks right. Top, second, top, fifth. Yeah, everything looks right there.

04:14:52
<transcript>: and then play

04:14:54
<transcript>: And then Player SATS.

04:14:54
<transcript>: phillies

04:14:55
poseidon000000: I've never seen a headphone with 2 cables connected before

04:14:59
<transcript>: Phillies and Cardinals. Oh, interesting. So for baseball, we're doing the full names.

04:14:59
<transcript>: ha

04:15:00
<transcript>: Ha.

04:15:05
<transcript>: So that's different.

04:15:09
<transcript>: And then the grids look different but otherwise same data.

04:15:09
<transcript>: the grid

04:15:13
<transcript>: The grid should look different because we're gonna change that.

04:15:13
<transcript>: does that look

04:15:16
<transcript>: Does that look great? I think. Yeah.

04:15:16
<transcript>: so i'm

04:15:16
thetonykano: .... @poseidon000000

04:15:23
<transcript>: So I'm need to maybe change this, but I don't know. Should it be consistent? This is how we do it in the NBA. Why are we doing it differently for baseball? I really understand.

04:15:26
<transcript>: Why would we do that differently.

04:15:29
<transcript>: So I just needed line score.

04:15:34
<transcript>: Do I want to be done? Do I want to be done? I think I should probably done.

04:15:49
<transcript>: Teach them. You got my follow keyboard. Sounds great. Thank you so much. It's a nice keyboard. It's also nice microphone. The microphone helps. I think I F you're streaming software Dev.
