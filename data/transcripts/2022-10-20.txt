<transcript>: You.

12:47:26
delvoid: heyoooo

00:02:25
yeltrah_: Hey hey

00:02:57
niftynate80: Let’s go

00:05:19
cedpoilly: hello 👋 just hopping by to say Hiii

00:05:26
cedpoilly: have a nice stream

00:10:59
<transcript>: Hey, Hey.

00:11:01
<transcript>: Hey.

00:11:01
<transcript>: i'm

00:11:05
<transcript>: I'm late. I would have been a lot earlier, but I was filming.

00:11:05
<transcript>: for

00:11:07
<transcript>: For YouTube.

00:11:10
<transcript>: I filmed my first video.

00:11:10
<transcript>: three times

00:11:13
tayloreddev: good afternoon

00:11:13
<transcript>: Three times now because.

00:11:13
<transcript>: i'm

00:11:15
gigo6000: Morning

00:11:19
fragaverage: what is this mysterious youtube content you speak of

00:11:20
<transcript>: I'm dumb and good afternoon, Taylor? Good morning, good afternoon, good evening and good night.

00:11:24
<transcript>: Double it's here and heart, Gene. And Nifty. Nate didn't say.

00:11:27
<transcript>: Well, she probably was here.

00:11:27
<transcript>: hello and good

00:11:28
2dorkstv: morning!

00:11:29
<transcript>: Hello and goodbye, said Polly.

00:11:36
<transcript>: Frag is here. What is this mysterious YouTube content you speak of? Tudorx is here. And Frag is here.

00:11:36
<transcript>: yeah so

00:11:43
<transcript>: Yeah. So it's been weeks in the making, not because I've actually been spending weeks on it. I have very limited bandwidth. Actually, I don't work that much.

00:11:49
<transcript>: So I have even more limited bandwidth in the hours I can record.

00:11:49
<transcript>: video content

00:11:57
<transcript>: Video content without my children stomping on the ceiling above me. If I have a dedicated studio space and I can spend all my working hours.

00:11:57
<transcript>: recording

00:11:59
<transcript>: Recording in peace and quiet.

00:11:59
<transcript>: then

00:12:03
<transcript>: Then things would go a lot smoother. But as I.

00:12:03
<transcript>: 've recorded

00:12:08
<transcript>: 've recorded the YouTube thing three times because. Okay, so let me just tell you. I'll tell you the whole thing.

00:12:11
zachrip: Can we donate so you can buy better internet for more bandwidth

00:12:14
<transcript>: The video is not even gonna be that good. I mean, it's just like it's whatever. It's gonna be like a ten minute video. It's just about a topic.

00:12:21
<transcript>: Donate so you can buy Bitter Edit for more bandwidth. I have lots of internet made with Zach. I don't have lots of time bandwidth.

00:12:25
delvoid: Blaming the kids...

00:12:34
fragaverage: my issue is attention bandwidth LUL

00:12:38
<transcript>: So I recorded the first time, just like, no script, just had some ideas in my head. And I thought, like, I'm blaming the kids. I thought, I'm just gonna, like, roll with it. I'm gonna turn on the camera. It's gonna be natural conversational. I'm just gonna, like, say things, and I did that.

00:12:38
<transcript>: and

00:12:40
<transcript>: And.

00:12:50
<transcript>: Most of the time, I didn't know what I was gonna say, and so I just, like, set there for a little bit, but I'd leave it recording for, like, 15 minutes, and then I'd like, come up with something else to say.

00:12:54
<transcript>: I recorded over a couple hours doing that.

00:12:58
zachrip: You should include the kids in the videos and let them explain the concepts

00:13:03
<transcript>: And set down to edit it. And it was a nightmare. Like I spent an entire day piecing together this, like very hard to follow.

00:13:03
<transcript>: argument

00:13:06
<transcript>: Argument against or for a thing. You'll see the video.

00:13:17
<transcript>: Spent an entire day like an entire day for us. It was gonna be like a six minute video, because that's all I could find. There's, like, six minutes of not garbage. In that video I recorded.

00:13:26
<transcript>: So that wasn't working. I was very engaged and expressive and excited about what I was talking about.

00:13:26
zachrip: Outlines are your friends :)

00:13:26
<transcript>: but

00:13:46
<transcript>: But I didn't have, like, a coherent thought process. So, yeah, outlines. That's a good callback. So then I went fullblown, I'm riding every word, I'm gonna say, I have a teleprompter. So I wrote a script, and, like, I'm gonna read every word, and it's gonna at least be, like, coherent, and it's gonna make editing faster, because then I can, like, read a script without.

00:13:46
<transcript>: having

00:13:54
<transcript>: Having to really like do a lot of take, but I can keep my takes organized a little better. So I did that version.

00:13:59
<transcript>: And I sounded like a robot, like I watched it all back, like I drug all the.

00:13:59
<transcript>: video the video

00:14:07
<transcript>: Video. The video files, like each of the points I made. I drugged them all onto for me. And it was like, this is so easy. No editing.

00:14:07
<transcript>: and

00:14:11
<transcript>: And right here itches and I almost itched my my headphone.

00:14:18
<transcript>: It was really easy to edit, laid it all out. Look at the video, and I'm like.

00:14:18
<transcript>: so today

00:14:31
<transcript>: So today I'm going to talk about it. Wasn't that bad, but it was pretty bad. Like it wasn't just like me talking. It was me reading a thing with no life in my eyes, like I was dead inside, just reading it.

00:14:36
<transcript>: So then the third time I just recorded this morning, the reason I was late.

00:14:36
<transcript>: i

00:14:44
<transcript>: I tried to read from a script, but also just like, think about the words I was saying and put something into them that wasn't just.

00:14:44
<transcript>: like

00:14:52
<transcript>: Like reading it to read it. I don't know. We'll see. I haven't looked at the third take yet, so I finished recording.

00:14:52
<transcript>: and then i started

00:14:55
<transcript>: And then I started the stream.

00:14:55
<transcript>: should include

00:14:59
<transcript>: Should include the kids in the videos and let them explain the concepts. Now, that's a great idea.

00:14:59
<transcript>: i

00:15:01
<transcript>: I love that idea.

00:15:01
<transcript>: my kids

00:15:02
<transcript>: My kids.

00:15:02
<transcript>: my seven year old

00:15:10
<transcript>: My seven year old. He's pretty smart. He might be able to do it. Frag, you have an attention bandwidth problem? Yeah, I get that. Me, too.

00:15:12
<transcript>: Me too.

00:15:14
zachrip: Do they program at all?

00:15:17
<transcript>: Okay. Let's work on. Aw, guess I want to get this thing done. I want to get it done. I get it done.

00:15:17
<transcript>: i say

00:15:27
<transcript>: I say, let's I'm gonna work on it, and I'm gonna ask questions, and hopefully somebody's gonna be like, oh, yeah? If you just do this and that'll work, that's how us working together works.

00:15:35
<transcript>: So, Zach, they don't I've got a seven year old, and I've got a turn three next monthyearold.

00:15:42
<transcript>: So I've got two year old. But he'll be three. And like not next month. Next week.

00:15:44
<transcript>: I grabbed four Halloween.

00:15:46
<transcript>: So they don't program.

00:15:53
<transcript>: But I might start trying to introduce some of the ideas to my seven year old Ziki's. Old enough, I could probably start.

00:16:00
<transcript>: Plan some seeds, you know. Thanks so much for the follow. Twisted transistors.

00:16:00
<transcript>: that's hard

00:16:03
<transcript>: That's hard to say twisted transistor.

00:16:03
<transcript>: that's

00:16:06
<transcript>: That's the wrong, that's the wrong scene.

00:16:11
<transcript>: I just took you right back to where we were. So that was fun.

00:16:12
fragaverage: Did you see the tweet I tagged you in? about building in public

00:16:13
zachrip: I'm a first time dad soon, I think I'll read them the c++ spec for bedtime

00:16:13
<transcript>: Let's go back over here though.

00:16:18
<transcript>: Geez, it's gonna be one of those days one of those days, one of those days.

00:16:18
<transcript>: all right

00:16:19
<transcript>: All right.

00:16:21
<transcript>: We're gonna listen to music.

00:16:26
<transcript>: Did I put it on.

00:16:26
<transcript>: shuffle

00:16:32
<transcript>: Shuffle it although altjay could be good just constant all day.

00:16:36
<transcript>: So AW, guess I want to finish it for reading.

00:16:36
<transcript>: reinven

00:16:38
<transcript>: Reinvent isn't like a month.

00:16:46
<transcript>: We're like one month to reinvent and reement reinvents at the end of the year. Delve, thank you so much for the resubscription.

00:16:49
<transcript>: Frag you tweeted me about.

00:16:52
twistedtransistor_: what r we cooking here?

00:16:52
<transcript>: Was this recently.

00:16:56
<transcript>: Just recently, frag.

00:16:58
<transcript>: Frag.

00:16:58
<transcript>: your name

00:17:00
<transcript>: Your name Drag on Twitter.

00:17:03
<transcript>: You you added me.

00:17:04
fragaverage: jamiedavies_dev

00:17:08
fragaverage: 41m ago

00:17:12
<transcript>: I missed it. And I don't get that many notifications. Jamie Davis, Dev. What was the. What was the tweet? How many days ago was this.

00:17:16
<transcript>: Ooh, Zack, your first time, dad. Soon.

00:17:16
<transcript>: you think

00:17:17
<transcript>: You think you'll read this.

00:17:19
fragaverage: it was on your feed just then LUL

00:17:23
<transcript>: Pack for bedtime. That might work. I'd be curious. Let me know how that goes.

00:17:28
<transcript>: Twisted transistor. What are we cooking? We're making an AWS guest game.

00:17:28
<transcript>: it's a guessing

00:17:35
<transcript>: It's a guessing game for AWS. You can play like a very basic version of it at eight of you Guess.com.

00:17:39
<transcript>: Basically you're shown services.

00:17:44
tayloreddev: any experience building alexa skills? I tried last night using the dev console it was a frustrating experience nothing worked WutFace

00:17:45
<transcript>: And you have to get which service it is like you've shown the logo.

00:17:48
<transcript>: And then you say that slight sale.

00:17:53
<transcript>: There's no scores or anything on the current site. And that's what we're building right now.

00:17:53
<transcript>: it was mostly

00:17:57
<transcript>: It was mostly an excuse to learn the T three stack.

00:18:00
delvoid: I thought about explaining concpets to my 5 year old and recording her reaction. But maybe shes to young just yet

00:18:02
<transcript>: 41 minutes ago, it was on my feed.

00:18:02
<transcript>: oh geez i'm so sorry

00:18:03
<transcript>: Oh, Geez, I'm so sorry.

00:18:03
<transcript>: i'm so sorry

00:18:05
<transcript>: I'm so sorry. Frag.

00:18:07
<transcript>: It was on my feed.

00:18:09
<transcript>: Oh, right here.

00:18:18
<transcript>: Who's building public a little bit connected. Raise your hand and I was building public and public in public haha when I actually work on it.

00:18:20
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:18:20
<transcript>: it's getting more

00:18:28
<transcript>: It's getting more and more rare. Okay, I'm gonna move my microphone because I have to move it between YouTube and streaming. It's gonna sound awful, I think.

00:18:28
<transcript>: someone co

00:18:32
<transcript>: Someone coined it as some are instead of ASMR this is gonna sound like.

00:18:32
<transcript>: it's gonna be

00:18:35
<transcript>: It's gonna be a negative ASMR experience.

00:18:37
<transcript>: How's that How's that.

00:18:47
<transcript>: That's funny, frag. I'm not actually working on it at the moment. I got a big decision to make with public to sell or not to sell.

00:18:52
fragaverage: to sell?!

00:18:52
<transcript>: Any experience building Alexa Skills actually tailored.

00:18:52
<transcript>: yes

00:18:56
<transcript>: Yes, I built some Alexa skills in my day.

00:18:56
<transcript>: let's see

00:18:57
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:18:57
<transcript>: matthew

00:18:59
<transcript>: Matthew Berry.

00:19:05
<transcript>: Alexis skill. There's like a fantasy football. Alexa skill. This one.

00:19:09
<transcript>: So I built a lot of this OOH.

00:19:11
<transcript>: The reviews.

00:19:11
<transcript>: when i was at st

00:19:20
<transcript>: When I was at Statini is, oh, man, they're all over the place. That's, like, the most evenly distributed set of reviews I've ever seen. Like, people don't know what to think about it.

00:19:24
<transcript>: Never answers the questions I asked oh, no.

00:19:24
<transcript>: it might not actually

00:19:27
<transcript>: It might not actually work anymore. I don't know.

00:19:29
<transcript>: Jay loves it.

00:19:32
<transcript>: That's too funny.

00:19:37
<transcript>: I mean the one's that are good. I know these are probably.

00:19:37
<transcript>: probably us

00:19:37
fragaverage: "this skill is average" basically LUL

00:19:39
<transcript>: Probably us anyway. Okay.

00:19:45
<transcript>: Yeah. I've built some Alexa skills. We did some weird stuff at Statmes with Alexis Fields. Like.

00:19:47
<transcript>: Real people's voices.

00:19:47
<transcript>: to like speech

00:19:50
<transcript>: To like speech synthesis with real people.

00:19:59
<transcript>: Frustrating. The Dev console. Yeah, yeah. All of the tooling around Alexa is frustrating. Like all of it.

00:20:12
<transcript>: Thought about explaining concepts to my five year old recording a reaction that would be good content. I'm pretty sure thanks so much for the follow. Why so Dankness? I don't know why I'm not getting like audio notifications in my ear.

00:20:12
<transcript>: when things

00:20:14
<transcript>: When things happen. But I'm not.

00:20:16
<transcript>: They might be broken.

00:20:19
<transcript>: This skill is average basically.

00:20:19
<transcript>: it's so

00:20:23
<transcript>: It's so mid as the ginsers would say.

00:20:28
<transcript>: What were we? What were we doing here? We were.

00:20:32
<transcript>: See what the what the game does when we click new game.

00:20:32
<transcript>: it does

00:20:34
<transcript>: It does that.

00:20:34
<transcript>: that's

00:20:38
<transcript>: That's guard duty now. Yes. Okay. So that's one thing we need to fix.

00:20:38
<transcript>: oh right

00:20:39
<transcript>: Oh, right, right.

00:20:42
<transcript>: So.

00:20:48
<transcript>: That was the big thing. We got to figure out how to do the timer. Wow. This is Yeah.

00:20:51
<transcript>: This is tough. There's a timer.

00:20:51
<transcript>: and we have

00:20:54
<transcript>: And we have to it's got to be dynamic.

00:20:54
<transcript>: based on

00:20:57
<transcript>: Based on getting answers right and wrong.

00:21:04
<transcript>: Should see this switch over to game over here shortly. Right. There it is. Yeah. Game over. Okay. So.

00:21:08
<transcript>: Let's do this. Let's actually.

00:21:13
<transcript>: Make a game overstate so we can at least see.

00:21:17
<transcript>: What's going on with my.

00:21:22
<transcript>: Lsp restart.

00:21:26
<transcript>: Like my Syntax Islands. Weird. It's off.

00:21:30
<transcript>: That's not what it should be colored. Like, what's going on.

00:21:35
<transcript>: sure

00:21:42
<transcript>: i did just update like everything in vim

00:21:49
cowfacedude99: try :e

00:21:50
<transcript>: But I feel like I've since I've updated everything I've seen syntax highlighting look better.

00:21:50
<transcript>: oh look go

00:21:51
<transcript>: Oh, look, go on.

00:21:54
<transcript>: This is so annoying too. This is the.

00:21:54
<transcript>: not an

00:21:56
<transcript>: Not an error.

00:22:03
<transcript>: Current is not never it thinks it is, but it's not why current matches.

00:22:08
<transcript>: That or current matches showing answer what's wrong with that.

00:22:14
cowfacedude99: it basically reopens the current file

00:22:18
<transcript>: Is that breaking my syntax highlighting.

00:22:27
<transcript>: Didn't me but like why are my HTML Tags colored weirdly.

00:22:31
<transcript>: I hate stuff like this.

00:22:34
<transcript>: I'm going to.

00:22:40
<transcript>: I'm going to go over here.

00:22:42
<transcript>: What's this.

00:22:45
<transcript>: What is that.

00:22:51
<transcript>: The T Max issue.

00:22:57
<transcript>: I want to let's see. Let's just update all of our stuff. I guess. I don't know.

00:23:00
<transcript>: Might help.

00:23:02
<transcript>: Might not.

00:23:10
<transcript>: Wrist pain. There we go.

00:23:16
<transcript>: Oh no.

00:23:18
<transcript>: Undo.

00:23:22
<transcript>: I don't want the filter. How do I do that.

00:23:25
<transcript>: There we go.

00:23:34
<transcript>: Let's see our diz colored now I don't know what I did. I broke something.

00:23:34
<transcript>: that's

00:23:37
<transcript>: That's not colored correctly.

00:23:41
<transcript>: I'll take a look sometimes, but I'm just gonna stop messing with it.

00:23:47
<transcript>: Reopens the current file. Thank you cow face.

00:23:54
<transcript>: Didn't work, but I appreciate the tips. Also. Hello, cafe.

00:23:58
<transcript>: Okay, let's make a.

00:23:58
<transcript>: so

00:24:01
<transcript>: So right down here. Let's see.

00:24:08
<transcript>: This is if we're active and there's a round, we display this thing.

00:24:11
<transcript>: And then if there's game over.

00:24:15
lukeyfam15: Hello

00:24:19
<transcript>: But here we're doing a context gain. We should only do this. It matches active. Right? I should just put this Div.

00:24:21
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:24:27
<transcript>: What.

00:24:31
<transcript>: Oh, there's like a nested. I see it.

00:24:45
<transcript>: I'd have to make this a fragment, I guess.

00:24:48
<transcript>: But what happens if I put it right here.

00:24:51
<transcript>: That could be right there. Maybe. Right there. Okay.

00:24:51
<transcript>: so

00:24:53
<transcript>: So let's do.

00:24:53
<transcript>: print

00:24:56
<transcript>: Print matches.

00:24:59
<transcript>: Game over.

00:25:02
<transcript>: And.

00:25:08
<transcript>: Game over I don't know.

00:25:09
<transcript>: Get there.

00:25:12
<transcript>: Okay.

00:25:12
<transcript>: so now we should

00:25:16
<transcript>: So now we should see it expire. Hello, Luki, Luki's, here.

00:25:19
<transcript>: Luki's here.

00:25:19
<transcript>: been a

00:25:21
<transcript>: Been a while Louie.

00:25:23
<transcript>: Maybe it has a.

00:25:23
<transcript>: it's

00:25:28
<transcript>: It's just been a while since I've straight. I just don't stream as much, and I hate it. I hate every second of it.

00:25:34
<transcript>: Hey every second of my not streaming.

00:25:38
<transcript>: I guess this could be.

00:25:42
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:25:47
<transcript>: Just as it was about to go to game over.

00:25:55
<transcript>: Okay. Let's see this thing transition over.

00:25:58
<transcript>: I should make that bigger.

00:25:58
<transcript>: except

00:26:00
<transcript>: Except that happens. Yeah.

00:26:04
<transcript>: Like delete that Div.

00:26:16
<transcript>: We're just waiting on the timeout if it wasn't clear what I'm doing.

00:26:16
<transcript>: it should go from

00:26:21
<transcript>: It should go from active to, yeah, to game over, and then it should say, Game over, yeah, let's just style that real quick.

00:26:24
<transcript>: Class.

00:26:24
<transcript>: name

00:26:29
<transcript>: Name my hands are so cold it's hard to type in your hands are cold it's really cold.

00:26:29
<transcript>: it got like

00:26:31
<transcript>: It got like down to 20 degrees.

00:26:31
<transcript>: sorry

00:26:37
<transcript>: Sorry, Fahrenheit. I don't know what that is in Celsius. It got down really cold. Really fast.

00:26:39
<transcript>: Text.

00:26:39
<transcript>: i

00:26:41
<transcript>: I used white.

00:26:44
<transcript>: Am I using like.

00:26:46
<transcript>: Some kind of.

00:26:46
<transcript>: like i

00:26:51
<transcript>: Like I think that's that's fine text, white text XL. I don't know.

00:26:53
jamesjansson: -6C

00:26:58
<transcript>: We'll just say.

00:27:05
theruggedbear: -6 celsius already ?

00:27:08
<transcript>: There you go, there we go? Game over.

00:27:11
<transcript>: Larger.

00:27:11
<transcript>: i don't know

00:27:12
lukeyfam15: What are we making?

00:27:12
<transcript>: I don't know.

00:27:12
<transcript>: this all

00:27:18
cowfacedude99: !awguess

00:27:18
fossabot: awguess is a guessing game where you're given an AWS service icon and you have to choose the correct service! https://github.com/adamelmore/awguess

00:27:20
<transcript>: This all needs more thought at some point, but there are the game over and then there'll be the button also. I guess I should move this.

00:27:23
<transcript>: This should be like.

00:27:28
<transcript>: Remove just that thing.

00:27:28
<transcript>: what i

00:27:30
<transcript>: What I use.

00:27:37
<transcript>: I could, oh, I could do, like, outside of So I could do, like.

00:27:39
<transcript>: That no.

00:27:42
<transcript>: Did that work.

00:27:43
<transcript>: Oh, it did.

00:27:48
<transcript>: No.

00:27:53
<transcript>: Yes. Okay. So we've got game over and it'll be like new button.

00:27:53
<transcript>: cool

00:27:54
<transcript>: Cool.

00:28:02
<transcript>: I obviously we're not gonna show the score like that.

00:28:02
<transcript>: it's just a placeholder

00:28:03
<transcript>: It's just a placeholder.

00:28:08
<transcript>: What are we making? Negative. Six degrees Celsius.

00:28:08
<transcript>: oof

00:28:15
<transcript>: Oof, yeah, it was like, Record lows here, I think Kansas City, which is north of me a little bit, but they got like a record low.

00:28:23
<transcript>: Sudden, it's gonna be 80 degrees Fahrenheit. And like a couple days here, that's Missouri. I live in a place where.

00:28:23
<transcript>: they say

00:28:30
<transcript>: They say if you don't like the weather in Missouri, come back tomorrow. It's like it's always different. Every day. It changes.

00:28:30
<transcript>: okay

00:28:37
<transcript>: Okay, so it could match idle or it could match game over and we need to show the new game button.

00:28:38
<transcript>: In either case.

00:28:42
cowfacedude99: global warming people LUL

00:28:45
<transcript>: So.

00:28:52
<transcript>: We're gonna do like current or current matches.

00:29:06
<transcript>: At least like a game overstate that we can see something happening. So now the question is.

00:29:11
<transcript>: How do I want to do this state machine? How do I do the expiring.

00:29:14
<transcript>: Global warming people.

00:29:18
<transcript>: Not really this global warming, right.

00:29:18
<transcript>: that makes

00:29:20
<transcript>: That makes things like more dramatic.

00:29:24
<transcript>: Wesley coder. Thank you so much for the resub. Wesley.

00:29:24
<transcript>: good

00:29:28
<transcript>: Good day, mates. How y'all doing? We're doing great.

00:29:33
<transcript>: Del void. Three months. Thank you again. Del void.

00:29:41
<transcript>: My notifications don't seem to be working I don't seem to be getting any notifications.

00:29:41
<transcript>: that bothers me

00:29:42
<transcript>: That bothers me.

00:29:46
<transcript>: What's this.

00:29:50
<transcript>: Is in rock working.

00:29:50
<transcript>: yes

00:29:51
<transcript>: Yes.

00:29:57
<transcript>: What if I do this.

00:30:07
<transcript>: Okay. So that's working. I don't know.

00:30:07
<transcript>: i just

00:30:11
<transcript>: I just don't hear notifications. Maybe it's something with Twitch.

00:30:17
<transcript>: Set the watch set to watch the activity feed.

00:30:18
<transcript>: Okay.

00:30:25
<transcript>: So here's the crux of the problem. The crux of the problem is that this UI I can't use it.

00:30:29
<transcript>: There we go.

00:30:29
<transcript>: oh they have a new

00:30:30
<transcript>: Oh, they have a new.

00:30:30
<transcript>: a new thing

00:30:32
<transcript>: A new thing.

00:30:32
tiredbeaver: are you in a financial position to retire right now?

00:30:38
theruggedbear: lol what happened

00:30:41
<transcript>: Is this the old visualizer? No. This might be the new one. I don't know this. Now we can see it. So the problem is when we go into the active state.

00:30:41
<transcript>: what we're doing

00:30:43
tiredbeaver: in other words, are you that rich

00:30:50
<transcript>: What we're doing right now is doing an after an expires promise is fulfilled. We go to Game Active. I'm sorry. No.

00:30:50
<transcript>: after

00:30:53
<transcript>: After it expires, we go to game over.

00:30:55
<transcript>: Okay.

00:31:01
<transcript>: But that needs to be dependent on every answer. Every time we get an answer back.

00:31:01
theruggedbear: we have a yellow screen everyone !

00:31:02
<transcript>: From.

00:31:02
<transcript>: what

00:31:08
<transcript>: What one of these anonymous. Every time we get an answer back.

00:31:08
cowfacedude99: and your bad hair day filter is broken LUL

00:31:15
<transcript>: We need to either shorten or lengthen like increase or decrease the expiration time.

00:31:15
<transcript>: you have

00:31:18
<transcript>: You have a yellow screen everywhere. Yes, you do.

00:31:18
<transcript>: the

00:31:23
wesleycoder: New visualizer here: https://stately.ai/registry

00:31:28
<transcript>: The Hair the Hair Day thing. It does not work with my Chroma key. I don't know why it's not a green background. It's like a yellow background.

00:31:28
<transcript>: i don't know

00:31:31
<transcript>: I don't know why it doesn't work on this screen, actually.

00:31:38
<transcript>: Are you in the financial position to retire right now.

00:31:41
stroopwafel26: here to say hi, gotta go :P

00:31:42
<transcript>: That was kind of out of nowhere. Tired Beaver. No, I don't think so.

00:31:46
<transcript>: I wouldn't retire right now. What is retiring anyway.

00:31:46
<transcript>: my wife and

00:31:51
<transcript>: My wife and I talk about this all the time. Like, if I stopped working, what would I do.

00:32:02
<transcript>: And even like someday when we're old, I don't know. Maybe we'll travel a little more. But like, am I gonna just stop wanting to be on the Internet and do things? I don't think so.

00:32:09
<transcript>: I mean, I like hanging out with my family, too, but like when I'm around much. She's kind of like, maybe you should work.

00:32:16
<transcript>: My family likes me too, I think. But I don't know. I've got like.

00:32:19
<transcript>: Stroop Stroop waffle.

00:32:19
<transcript>: i don't

00:32:24
<transcript>: I don't hear notifications because they're not coming in. I'm not getting them.

00:32:24
<transcript>: thank you so much

00:32:27
<transcript>: Thank you so much for three months. Stroop.

00:32:27
<transcript>: it's

00:32:27
delvoid: get outta here and do some work

00:32:30
<transcript>: It's been a fun three months together.

00:32:36
<transcript>: I've only been streaming for three months, so if you have the three month badge you've been there since day one ish.

00:32:36
<transcript>: week

00:32:39
<transcript>: Week Week One ish.

00:32:46
<transcript>: I don't know if anyone was here for my first dream. I think I just streamed into the void for a few. A few streams.

00:32:53
cowfacedude99: your family likes you but they don't like you that much LUL

00:33:01
<transcript>: Yeah bad hair day filter is broken, but you guys are just gonna look at it just gonna look at new visual errors. Visualizer is here. Copy link. Let's see.

00:33:03
cowfacedude99: I came pretty late.

00:33:03
<transcript>: Registry.

00:33:09
<transcript>: Was it? Oh, yeah. We built this with David. Right on stream. He helped me.

00:33:14
<transcript>: But can I connect the thing, the inspect thing to this new one? Probably not.

00:33:20
<transcript>: Oh, here to say Hi gotta go by Stroop I miss you.

00:33:27
<transcript>: Thanks, Troops. Send me a DM on Twitter. Am I if I'm streaming it a wrong time for you, I will fix it because.

00:33:30
<transcript>: I like you and I'm out with you.

00:33:38
<transcript>: Your family likes you, but they don't like you that much. Exactly.

00:33:38
<transcript>: your cup is

00:33:50
<transcript>: Your cup is you came when I was like doing the needle them configuration, which was maybe halfway in my Twitch journey. Feel like I could probably break my Twitch journey into like quadrants or thirds.

00:33:50
<transcript>: there was like the

00:33:56
<transcript>: There was like the first 3rd, which was just like building my Twitch overlay, and then the second 3rd.

00:33:56
<transcript>: was like

00:34:04
<transcript>: Was like configuring new of them and learning how to them around and then this 3rd 3rd has been.

00:34:04
<transcript>: a hodgepod

00:34:06
<transcript>: A hodgepodge.

00:34:06
<transcript>: of

00:34:12
<transcript>: Of AW guess. Oh the first search was public too. I guess I did public baddev for a bit.

00:34:14
<transcript>: Okay.

00:34:14
<transcript>: so i

00:34:17
daglee: I think the only good schedule is that you are always on.

00:34:19
stroopwafel26: Schedule is fine, it's a weird week for me, my wife had surgery, they removed some cancer so I'm taking care of the kid and everything (everything went well, she's recovering now)

00:34:23
resonaut: six sigma neovim journey

00:34:24
<transcript>: So I don't need the new visualizer. What I need to do is think about this state machine differently. I think the problem the inherent problem here is.

00:34:24
<transcript>: i need

00:34:29
<transcript>: I need to be able to interrupt when you're in the guessing state. Right here.

00:34:29
<transcript>: we

00:34:34
cowfacedude99: I think I came about one/two stream before you switched to neovim

00:34:35
<transcript>: We need to be able to interrupt that at any moment because the expiration the expiration hit.

00:34:35
<transcript>: once

00:34:46
<transcript>: Once the game expires, we should move into game over no matter what state we're in. And I can't use this dynamic delay here because it only evaluates when you enter into the game active state. Okay.

00:34:46
<transcript>: tracking

00:34:47
<transcript>: Tracking.

00:34:47
<transcript>: i'm

00:34:51
<transcript>: I'm barely tracking and it's my own thoughts.

00:34:56
<transcript>: So I think what I need to do is maybe do like a delayed event.

00:34:56
<transcript>: every time

00:35:15
<transcript>: Every time you answer, so when you start the game and every time you answer, we do a delayed event based on the expiration and that event. We need to be able to cancel it. I'm not sure if that's possible, but basically that event will send us into the game overstate. Let's go to X state. Docs, let's do this.

00:35:23
<transcript>: So events.

00:35:33
<transcript>: You do delayed.

00:35:33
<transcript>: a delayed

00:35:35
<transcript>: A delayed events in Transitions. Here we go.

00:35:35
<transcript>: transition

00:35:39
<transcript>: Transition can be taken automatically after a delay.

00:35:46
<transcript>: Green after 1 second.

00:35:51
<transcript>: Can be conditional.

00:35:56
<transcript>: So after 1 second if traffic is light.

00:36:00
<transcript>: Okay.

00:36:00
<transcript>: i but there

00:36:04
<transcript>: I but there's no fixed so that part has to be.

00:36:07
<transcript>: Dynamic right.

00:36:07
<transcript>: delay

00:36:10
<transcript>: Delay expressions. So after light delay.

00:36:10
<transcript>: and then

00:36:13
<transcript>: And then light delay is defined in here.

00:36:13
<transcript>: that's what we're doing

00:36:18
<transcript>: That's what we're doing right now. We're using a dynamic delay.

00:36:18
<transcript>: but

00:36:22
<transcript>: But it doesn't. It doesn't meet all our needs.

00:36:35
<transcript>: Okay. Well.

00:36:38
<transcript>: Maybe it's what we have right now.

00:36:47
<transcript>: If you just want to send an event after delay, you can specify the delay. Delays. An option. The second argument of the send.

00:36:49
<transcript>: Okay.

00:36:49
<transcript>: so this could

00:36:51
<transcript>: So this could be in action.

00:36:57
<transcript>: We could say yeah. Send timer after 1 second. Okay, let's think about this.

00:37:02
<transcript>: Delay? Can it be any of the other kind of delays.

00:37:02
<transcript>: can it be

00:37:06
<transcript>: Can it be not constant? Can it be a function as well.

00:37:14
<transcript>: I think the only good schedule is that you're always on.

00:37:14
<transcript>: i would love

00:37:16
<transcript>: I would love to just always be streaming.

00:37:30
yeltrah_: @stroopwafel26 Glad everything is going well buddy

00:37:35
<transcript>: Schedules fine. It's a weird week for me. Okay. Now. Oh, I'm so. I'm sorry to hear about your wife. They removed some cancer, some taking care of the kids and everything. Everything went well. That's good that she's recovering. I'm so sorry. I did not mean to add any pressure to your live Stroop. Just take care of your wife. We'll see you when we see you.

00:37:39
<transcript>: Six Sigma, Neovem, journey.

00:37:47
<transcript>: I think I came about one, two streams before you switch any of them. Oh, okay. So you're here before I switch you watch the whole thing.

00:38:01
<transcript>: Okay. So I'm trying to figure out if I can piece together.

00:38:12
<transcript>: Oh, and you can cancel events. This is what I need to do. Okay, you can also present prevent those delayed events from being sent by canceling them. I think we can make this work.

00:38:12
<transcript>: i

00:38:14
<transcript>: I think.

00:38:16
<transcript>: Think we can make it work.

00:38:16
<transcript>: so here's

00:38:18
<transcript>: So here's how it works.

00:38:18
<transcript>: let's look

00:38:20
<transcript>: Let's look at our state machine.

00:38:20
<transcript>: so i can make this

00:38:21
<transcript>: So I can make this bigger.

00:38:25
<transcript>: Come on. Bigger. There we go.

00:38:28
<transcript>: So I think.

00:38:32
<transcript>: Where's our State machine? Here we go.

00:38:36
<transcript>: Okay. So we start there's a starting.

00:38:36
<transcript>: which

00:38:39
<transcript>: Which does an invoke.

00:38:44
sockenguy: uff your keyboard sounds fancy

00:38:50
<transcript>: Invoke start undone. It assigned the game and the rounds, and then we go into active. And now, right now, we have this after. Right here.

00:38:50
<transcript>: but we

00:38:51
<transcript>: But we actually.

00:38:51
<transcript>: don't

00:38:54
<transcript>: Don't want to do this anymore.

00:38:56
<transcript>: Right.

00:38:59
<transcript>: I don't think we want to do this anymore.

00:38:59
<transcript>: i think

00:39:07
<transcript>: I think now we go into guessing and on entry, we're assigning choice and results. We're wiping out toys and result from context.

00:39:09
<transcript>: But.

00:39:09
<transcript>: also we need

00:39:12
<transcript>: Also, we need to send a delayed event.

00:39:15
<transcript>: So send.

00:39:17
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:39:17
<transcript>: we can do

00:39:20
<transcript>: We can do that next. So send.

00:39:24
<transcript>: Hi.

00:39:26
<transcript>: himer

00:39:27
<transcript>: Himer.

00:39:30
<transcript>: I think this is how this works.

00:39:35
<transcript>: Let's see if we get a basic one working. No code actions available.

00:39:38
<transcript>: Like I've broken mostly everything.

00:39:49
<transcript>: Okay. So we can send where is it.

00:39:50
ozdy: Bro, can you tell me best ORM for DynamoDB Cheer1 ?

00:39:53
<transcript>: Oh, right here.

00:39:53
<transcript>: so

00:39:57
<transcript>: So send type timer. And then they're doing.

00:39:59
<transcript>: A delay.

00:39:59
<transcript>: delay

00:40:01
<transcript>: Delay.

00:40:07
<transcript>: And then we have an ID so that we can cancel it.

00:40:09
<transcript>: Test timer. Okay.

00:40:11
<transcript>: Let's say we've did this.

00:40:15
<transcript>: What is this doing? Type timer.

00:40:16
sockenguy: Prisma is cool, but dunno if that works for you

00:40:20
<transcript>: So action just in the timer event. Oh, yeah, yeah, it's the event we're sending. Okay.

00:40:22
<transcript>: So.

00:40:22
<transcript>: i

00:40:25
<transcript>: I Well, it's gonna be.

00:40:29
<transcript>: Like Expired. We'll have an event called It expired.

00:40:32
<transcript>: And.

00:40:36
<transcript>: How do we do that.

00:40:40
<transcript>: So on yeah, Yeah.

00:40:40
<transcript>: game over

00:40:41
<transcript>: Game over.

00:40:41
<transcript>: if

00:40:44
<transcript>: If we're in the active state.

00:40:44
<transcript>: we need

00:40:46
<transcript>: We need to say.

00:40:50
<transcript>: Here. Can we do this.

00:40:50
<transcript>: on

00:40:51
<transcript>: On.

00:40:51
<transcript>: yeah

00:40:54
<transcript>: Yeah, so on.

00:40:54
ozdy: Yeah I forgot to add for TypeScript, prisma is ok I guess, thanks

00:40:58
<transcript>: Expired.

00:41:01
<transcript>: Target.

00:41:04
<transcript>: Name Over, I think.

00:41:06
<transcript>: Oh, what's wrong.

00:41:08
<transcript>: On.

00:41:11
<transcript>: Expired. What did I do wrong.

00:41:15
<transcript>: Sites not have a comma there.

00:41:17
<transcript>: On expired.

00:41:17
<transcript>: what

00:41:18
<transcript>: What.

00:41:21
<transcript>: Active.

00:41:25
<transcript>: On expired type expires last time.

00:41:25
ozdy: hm, prisma says no dynamodb support

00:41:30
<transcript>: Anybody see the problem? I don't see the problem.

00:41:38
<transcript>: I think expired target string is not assignable to transitions. Config.

00:41:41
<transcript>: I mean, it's exactly what I did up there, right.

00:41:41
<transcript>: oh do i

00:41:48
<transcript>: Oh, do I need to define let's see? Oh, yeah? I needed to define game of it here. So.

00:41:48
<transcript>: let's

00:41:51
<transcript>: Let's see let's do like or tie.

00:41:51
<transcript>: exp

00:41:52
sockenguy: sry, no experience with dynamodb :D

00:41:54
<transcript>: Expired I forget TypeScript is a.

00:42:00
<transcript>: Param. For that one. Yes.

00:42:00
<transcript>: so

00:42:05
<transcript>: So there we go. So on expired. We go to game over.

00:42:11
<transcript>: Let's see so we send expired after 1 second.

00:42:12
<transcript>: Let's.

00:42:12
<transcript>: let's make

00:42:14
<transcript>: Let's make that like.

00:42:14
<transcript>: ten seconds

00:42:27
<transcript>: 10 seconds. So we have one more time here. So we're gonna go to expire as soon as you enter into guessing that's not accurate. We're gonna we're gonna get to the hopefully accurate thing. Assuming I can do a function here that looks at context.

00:42:31
<transcript>: But we're gonna send expired.

00:42:36
<transcript>: Based on the context.

00:42:36
<transcript>: and then we're gonna keep

00:42:41
<transcript>: And then we're gonna keep it when we're gonna cancel it, when you answer.

00:42:48
<transcript>: Okay. Oh, here. Right here. So actions assign, and then we're gonna have a send or cancel.

00:42:54
<transcript>: Cancel test timer I don't know.

00:42:56
<transcript>: We need to go up here.

00:43:01
<transcript>: Canful.

00:43:03
<transcript>: Right.

00:43:07
<transcript>: Is that where they imported it from? Cancel actions.

00:43:09
<transcript>: Oh.

00:43:09
<transcript>: oh

00:43:11
<transcript>: Oh, what.

00:43:14
<transcript>: Wait. What.

00:43:17
<transcript>: End is an actions too.

00:43:23
<transcript>: Is that right.

00:43:28
<transcript>: Actions.

00:43:33
<transcript>: Is that right.

00:43:35
<transcript>: Right. And your bird.

00:43:40
<transcript>: Thinking I shoulder move like all Andrew bird.

00:43:50
<transcript>: Just not been I'm not self the Andrew Bird music when I'm streaming so now I can say like actions, send.

00:43:56
<transcript>: Actions. Cancel.

00:44:01
<transcript>: Does that work.

00:44:09
<transcript>: Target. String actions.

00:44:09
<transcript>: what

00:44:10
<transcript>: What.

00:44:15
<transcript>: Actions.

00:44:21
<transcript>: Oh, is it confused? Wait, now.

00:44:29
<transcript>: This really is this really where it's how it's defined? I guess I could do, like.

00:44:31
fanieldanara: An ORM for DynamoDB sounds like a bad idea, query efficiency using specific indexes and access patterns is really important or cost can scale out of control

00:44:33
<transcript>: Send and cancel.

00:44:38
<transcript>: Equal action.

00:44:47
<transcript>: Like that. Why is the sign? Why does the sign that's an action? Why does it live up here? I don't understand the way this is organized.

00:44:50
<transcript>: But that doesn't work.

00:44:55
wesleycoder: the actions prop should be an array when you have multiple actions occuring

00:45:02
<transcript>: Well, identifying.

00:45:04
<transcript>: Cancel.

00:45:10
wesleycoder: assign and cancel should be inside an array

00:45:15
<transcript>: Are talking.

00:45:15
<transcript>: people

00:45:17
<transcript>: People are talking about things.

00:45:23
<transcript>: Your keyboard sounds fancy Can you tell me best RM for DynamoDB.

00:45:23
<transcript>: oh

00:45:32
<transcript>: Oh, thanks for the bit Oz. D. I don't know why I'm not hearing anything in my headphones today. I'm not getting any notifications, so I'm completely blind.

00:45:32
<transcript>: but

00:45:36
<transcript>: But thank you for that bit best off our M for DynamoDB.

00:45:36
<transcript>: i think

00:45:47
<transcript>: I think people like electrodb, people that are smart, like DAX has said good things about electrodb. If you want some tight script safety in your Dynamo single table design.

00:45:51
<transcript>: Does have a big README that was my only barrier.

00:46:00
<transcript>: I don't have the attention span to read or read me that big. But Tyler's, he seems really smart. He's making a cool thing. It's called Electro DB. Otherwise.

00:46:00
<transcript>: there's also

00:46:14
<transcript>: There's also. Oh, Jeremy, Jeremy Daley has DynamoDB toolbox. You could look that up. And I've heard good things. I just don't use an Orm for DynamoDB. I mostly don't do DynamoDB. Api. Calls from like.

00:46:22
<transcript>: Java script or TypeScript from node. I do it from like VTL templates so I don't use an RM.

00:46:22
<transcript>: which

00:46:25
ozdy: Thanks, will try ElectroDB Cheer1

00:46:25
<transcript>: Which means I opt into the terrible Dev experience.

00:46:25
<transcript>: for

00:46:27
<transcript>: For reasons.

00:46:37
<transcript>: Yeah, Prisma doesn't support Dynamo. Unfortunately, I forgot to add. Well, maybe not. Unfortunately, Prisma is a whole other conversation I forgot to add for type script. Frisbee is okay, I guess.

00:46:41
cowfacedude99: @wesleycoder honestly I kind of find the destructing inside array a little wierd

00:46:45
<transcript>: Or in for DynamoDB. Sounds like a bad idea. Query efficiency using Pacific indices and access patterns is really important.

00:46:45
<transcript>: yeah

00:46:47
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:46:53
<transcript>: Actions. Prop. Should be an array when you have multiple actions occurring. Oh, that's a problem. Thank you, Wesley.

00:46:56
<transcript>: A sign and kisses should be in a right that makes sense.

00:46:56
<transcript>: also

00:47:00
<transcript>: Also, I kind of find the destructoring inside array. A little weird.

00:47:05
<transcript>: So this.

00:47:14
<transcript>: We assign and we cancel the test timer.

00:47:16
<transcript>: Every time you guess.

00:47:16
<transcript>: we canceled

00:47:21
<transcript>: We canceled the previous timer. I guess we should do that. Maybe on.

00:47:22
wesleycoder: yep, it is a little bit weird, but its what we got...

00:47:25
<transcript>: Showing answer.

00:47:29
<transcript>: Maybe.

00:47:29
<transcript>: try

00:47:33
<transcript>: Try to think when we should potentially transition to.

00:47:33
<transcript>: game over

00:47:34
<transcript>: Game over.

00:47:34
<transcript>: if

00:47:37
<transcript>: If it's checking to see if your answer is correct.

00:47:45
<transcript>: I guess we don't want to interrupt that. So we'll okay. We'll say we'll say this. Let's just see if we get this to work and then.

00:47:52
<transcript>: So we send an expired on a ten second delay so you only have 10 seconds to guess. I guess.

00:47:52
<transcript>: i guess

00:47:53
<transcript>: I guess.

00:47:56
<transcript>: Let's make it.

00:47:59
<transcript>: 5 seconds.

00:48:03
<transcript>: And then we cancel it. If you answer.

00:48:09
<transcript>: So this should be working. Let's just test it.

00:48:17
<transcript>: New game.

00:48:23
<transcript>: I really can't make this UI work.

00:48:27
<transcript>: Okay was that 5 seconds? I already went to game over.

00:48:31
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow diaries. I heard that one.

00:48:36
<transcript>: Thank you for the second bit. Ozd.

00:48:40
<transcript>: I don't think you can follow Victor.

00:48:43
<transcript>: Victor Rodriguez.

00:48:47
<transcript>: Alright.

00:48:58
<transcript>: So that that works. Did it work if I cancel? So let's do or if I actually like click one, it should not expire. I should be able to just keep clicking.

00:49:02
<transcript>: Like indefinitely. Right? And it shouldn't expire me.

00:49:09
<transcript>: Just like this. That's not right. Audit manager.

00:49:12
nexxeln: hi adamn

00:49:16
<transcript>: Shield. Yeah. So it's not expiring because we're canceling that timer. That's all. Great.

00:49:16
nexxeln: adam*

00:49:22
thdxr: I'm considering not going to the gym on days you don't stream

00:49:23
<transcript>: And then after 5 seconds of not guessing it'll send expired right.

00:49:27
<transcript>: Okay.

00:49:27
<transcript>: so

00:49:31
thdxr: 10x worse experience

00:49:32
<transcript>: So the next question is DAX is here. I'm considering not going to the gym on days. You don't stream. Wait.

00:49:32
<transcript>: all the

00:49:42
<transcript>: All the negatives. I gotta think about this. Not going to the gym on days. You don't stream that first experience. I appreciate that. Hey, Nix is here.

00:49:42
<transcript>: thanks for the follow

00:49:44
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow Brandon.

00:49:48
<transcript>: Is there something about my voice acts that helps get a pump in.

00:49:54
<transcript>: I've never tried listening to myself talk while working out. I should try that.

00:49:58
<transcript>: That would be the most like narcissistic thing you could do, right.

00:49:58
<transcript>: like go

00:50:02
<transcript>: Like, go into the gym, and you just got your headphones in listening to yourself.

00:50:02
<transcript>: you could do it

00:50:05
<transcript>: You could do it. You got this.

00:50:12
<transcript>: Okay.

00:50:15
nexxeln: LUL

00:50:18
<transcript>: So that text white idea. That was a bad one.

00:50:21
thdxr: nothing like getting a pump and hearing "hm let me check the xstate docs"

00:50:25
<transcript>: Yeah, it shouldn't be text. White.

00:50:25
<transcript>: it should be like

00:50:27
<transcript>: It should be like, What's that color I'm using.

00:50:30
<transcript>: X.

00:50:41
<transcript>: Okay. So this Andrew, this Andrew Bird song. Coslaps this is good.

00:50:43
<transcript>: I do like him.

00:50:48
<transcript>: Really? Is it Orange? Text, Orange.

00:50:54
<transcript>: White.

00:50:59
<transcript>: To Orange.

00:51:01
<transcript>: Nine.

00:51:05
<transcript>: And this one too.

00:51:07
<transcript>: Okay.

00:51:09
<transcript>: Feels good.

00:51:16
<transcript>: Let's let's fix some things so that timer is a proof of concept.

00:51:16
<transcript>: now we

00:51:18
<transcript>: Now we need to make it real.

00:51:18
<transcript>: but what really

00:51:20
<transcript>: But what really needs to happen.

00:51:20
<transcript>: is

00:51:22
<transcript>: Is.

00:51:26
<transcript>: It needs to be dynamic. So let's go back to our dynamic.

00:51:28
<transcript>: Where's the dynamic.

00:51:31
<transcript>: Delay expressions.

00:51:34
<transcript>: Right.

00:51:43
<transcript>: Oh, well, we already wrote this, right. So it's called.

00:51:48
<transcript>: Yeah, it's called Expires. So now the delay can be.

00:51:48
<transcript>: where is this

00:51:50
<transcript>: Where is this.

00:51:54
<transcript>: The lay expressions, the late events.

00:52:03
<transcript>: After, yeah, here we go. After delay, light, delay.

00:52:08
<transcript>: So instead of it being delay 5000.

00:52:08
<transcript>: we can make

00:52:10
<transcript>: We can make this.

00:52:10
<transcript>: delay

00:52:11
<transcript>: Delay.

00:52:13
<transcript>: Fires.

00:52:19
<transcript>: Okay. And then the ID. Let's actually make this a real ID. Let's say.

00:52:22
<transcript>: Type expired. Let's say.

00:52:25
<transcript>: This timer.

00:52:34
<transcript>: So now it should use.

00:52:36
<transcript>: Expires.

00:52:43
<transcript>: Fires. Yeah. There it is. Which takes in the context. Why am I logging? Nothing. There we go.

00:52:43
<transcript>: takes

00:52:46
<transcript>: Takes in the context.

00:52:53
<transcript>: And if the context okay return game expired.

00:52:53
<transcript>: get time

00:52:58
<transcript>: Get time minus date now so that's alright because the context we're gonna keep updating it with.

00:53:01
<transcript>: Wait, are we going to.

00:53:04
<transcript>: No.

00:53:09
<transcript>: We're not gonna update context. That game. We're gonna update context, that result.

00:53:11
<transcript>: Right.

00:53:16
<transcript>: Or maybe we are not actually. I think.

00:53:16
<transcript>: we should

00:53:19
<transcript>: We should be updating context that game. So let's go up here.

00:53:25
<transcript>: Where was I doing that? Yeah. Here we go.

00:53:26
<transcript>: So.

00:53:26
<transcript>: after

00:53:32
<transcript>: After we get the answer showing answer here we set round.

00:53:35
<transcript>: Up here we set result.

00:53:38
<transcript>: Where is that.

00:53:41
<transcript>: Nope.

00:53:44
haliphax: xstate is the JS state machine library? only other time I've seen someone else use it :)

00:53:44
<transcript>: Right here.

00:53:44
<transcript>: result we

00:53:47
<transcript>: Result we need to also set game.

00:53:48
<transcript>: To.

00:53:54
<transcript>: Event data game.

00:54:03
<transcript>: We're updating the game which has a new score on it. That's why our score counter hasn't been working because we haven't been updating the game.

00:54:03
<transcript>: right

00:54:05
<transcript>: Right.

00:54:05
<transcript>: yeah

00:54:06
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:54:06
<transcript>: okay

00:54:07
<transcript>: Okay.

00:54:23
<transcript>: So now the expires thing should work. We cancel that timer every time we check the answer or every time we enter into guess now.

00:54:28
<transcript>: Ongues go to checking answer.

00:54:31
<transcript>: And cancel the timer.

00:54:36
<transcript>: So don't go into expired, but then we need to.

00:54:45
<transcript>: I'm wondering if, like if there's a edge case here. We'll think about it in a minute, but I think there's an edge case where.

00:54:47
<transcript>: If.

00:54:54
<transcript>: You started if you click the button, you started answering and it's checking the answer, but then the timer expires.

00:55:00
<transcript>: Or if the time expired right before you click button, but you somehow click the button right before the timer expired.

00:55:06
<transcript>: And then technically, you didn't get your answer incorrect in time.

00:55:12
<transcript>: We need to transition the game over because it expires, so I'm not sure on that one, but let's just.

00:55:16
<transcript>: Shelf that I guess so we send you expired event.

00:55:16
<transcript>: after

00:55:19
<transcript>: After the expires function resolves.

00:55:25
<transcript>: Yeah, I think this is gonna work.

00:55:25
<transcript>: thank

00:55:27
<transcript>: Thank you for the Followed DC.

00:55:29
<transcript>: D. Calvet.

00:55:33
<transcript>: Nothing like getting a pump in hearing I'm.

00:55:33
<transcript>: let me

00:55:36
<transcript>: Let me check the X state talks.

00:55:45
<transcript>: X Eight is the JavaScript State Machine library. Only other time I've seen someone else use it. Yeah, that's right. Halifax. Also. Welcome to Chat. Welcome, welcome, welcome.

00:55:49
<transcript>: It's nice to have you here. Thank you for the follow. Bulldog.

00:55:53
<transcript>: All right, let's see.

00:56:09
<transcript>: Is there any holes? Should this just work now we cancel the timer. We need to restart the site, but we will. Every time we go back to guessing state, we'll restart the timer, right? And the timer should be dynamic every time. I don't know. I think this is like maybe gonna work. Maybe.

00:56:09
<transcript>: so follow hali

00:56:11
<transcript>: So follow Halifax.

00:56:14
haliphax: and in the Ozarks? I'm in north-central MO LUL

00:56:21
<transcript>: Okay, so if I get one right, I'm not gonna get it right. I got it right, I got one. So that's where we updated the game state. Now it's showing correctly.

00:56:21
<transcript>: what

00:56:23
<transcript>: What is this.

00:56:25
haliphax: grew up in Columbia

00:56:31
<transcript>: Where it shows. Like you broke that's Sage maker. Another Sage maker. I've got that on my wall. I literally have that icon on my wall.

00:56:40
<transcript>: So. Samari. Samarion. I don't know. Efs. Of course, it's a file system.

00:56:42
<transcript>: This is gonna be something.

00:56:44
<transcript>: Box? Yeah.

00:56:52
daryn_dev: Good Evening all :)

00:56:53
<transcript>: Okay. So now I should be getting more time. Oh, yeah. I'm actually logging this thing, right.

00:56:53
<transcript>: so

00:56:58
<transcript>: So as I get them right, I should be up there, but the game over.

00:56:58
<transcript>: was i getting more

00:56:59
<transcript>: Was I getting more time.

00:56:59
<transcript>: i guess

00:57:06
<transcript>: I guess we need to show the progress we need to actually show the expiration progress that'll help debug.

00:57:12
<transcript>: What is this I'm looking at.

00:57:14
<transcript>: This thing.

00:57:19
<transcript>: Okay.

00:57:22
<transcript>: Is this playlist entirely? Andrew bird.

00:57:26
<transcript>: Good Evening, Darren. Darren's. Here.

00:57:26
<transcript>: whoa

00:57:29
<transcript>: Whoa. You grew up in Colombia.

00:57:31
<transcript>: That's crazy.

00:57:31
<transcript>: i live

00:57:35
<transcript>: I live like right next to Springfield. Nixa, south of Springfield.

00:57:35
<transcript>: that's crazy

00:57:38
<transcript>: That's crazy don't meet a lot of Missourians.

00:57:42
<transcript>: A lot of folks from the Show Me State in these parts.

00:57:42
<transcript>: let's see

00:57:45
<transcript>: Let's see. I'm gonna do something.

00:57:57

00:58:06
resonaut: maybe play donald byrd

00:58:10
<transcript>: Your brotherinlaw's in Joplin been through Nixa many times. How crazy. Well, next time you're in, just pop in. We can we'll start a stream? You can join me. Halifax on stream.

00:58:14
<transcript>: Donald Bird Never heard of Donald bird.

00:58:18
haliphax: ha will do

00:58:19
<transcript>: Okay. Let's see. Is this actually working? Is the question. So let's make the timer.

00:58:19
<transcript>: animate like

00:58:24
<transcript>: Animate like it used to and that'll tell us if the timer is working right.

00:58:26
<transcript>: Right.

00:58:29
<transcript>: Maybe.

00:58:29
<transcript>: why isn't

00:58:32
<transcript>: Why isn't it working? I actually don't know why it's not working.

00:58:36
<transcript>: As far as I'm concerned, I didn't remove that code. Here we go.

00:58:37
<transcript>: So.

00:58:37
<transcript>: when the

00:58:40
<transcript>: When the context game.

00:58:45
<transcript>: Changes. We set this timer.

00:58:51
<transcript>: It has an interval set in our interval.

00:59:03
<transcript>: Okay, so we get the start time, which is the game start time. We get now and then the expires should be the game expires time. Okay.

00:59:06
<transcript>: The total is a.

00:59:09
<transcript>: Minus start.

00:59:13
<transcript>: Expires.

00:59:23
<transcript>: Minus start. I hate date math. I hate this so much. Yes, expires minus start. That's the total amount of time.

00:59:23
<transcript>: the elapse is now

00:59:25
<transcript>: The Elapse is now.

00:59:25
<transcript>: minus

00:59:27
<transcript>: Minus the start.

00:59:37
<transcript>: So how much time has gone by divided by the total. So we get a percentage. And then we do some multiplying by 100. Okay.

00:59:37
<transcript>: what's the problem then

00:59:38
<transcript>: What's the problem, then.

00:59:43
<transcript>: If value is equal to active, let's say instead of that, let's do.

00:59:48
<transcript>: Let's do if current matches.

00:59:52
<transcript>: I guess it never matches active, right.

01:00:01
<transcript>: Active is like a it goes, that's like a parent machine. So it's not current equals active. It's it's a current matches guessing.

01:00:07
<transcript>: Right. I might just work now in a side from this issue.

01:00:16
<transcript>: I don't love the way this is. Do we have to do that? I don't even know.

01:00:25
<transcript>: Just just fix it. Just fix it. There we go.

01:00:25
<transcript>: okay

01:00:27
<transcript>: Okay, let's try it.

01:00:33
<transcript>: No timer. Okay, well, let's log. Let's log the thing.

01:00:40
<transcript>: That'll teach it.

01:00:46
<transcript>: Let's see new game. Oh, it's logging.

01:00:53
<transcript>: So 10%. So this should be I don't know why it's not progressing, because that looks like valid numbers, right.

01:00:56
<transcript>: So we're coming up on halfway.

01:01:00
<transcript>: Should be a third timer so that makes sense.

01:01:05
<transcript>: Okay. What's the problem, then.

01:01:11
<transcript>: What is the problem? I'm gonna just watch that go to a hundred just to make sure.

01:01:14
<transcript>: Yeah. And then game over.

01:01:14
<transcript>: oh and then

01:01:17
<transcript>: Oh, and then it just keeps going forever.

01:01:17
<transcript>: well

01:01:18
<transcript>: Well, that's not ideal.

01:01:25
<transcript>: We'll figure that out later. Okay. So that seems to be working. Are we.

01:01:25
<transcript>: using

01:01:27
<transcript>: Using Elapse anywhere.

01:01:29
profitztv: Greetings

01:01:36
<transcript>: I'm Rubbar here we go. Background Green Elapse is less than 100. If Elast equals 100.

01:01:36
<transcript>: it's red

01:01:38
<transcript>: It's red.

01:01:38
<transcript>: the width

01:01:40
<transcript>: The width is elapsed.

01:01:40
<transcript>: percentage

01:01:41
<transcript>: Percentage.

01:01:41
<transcript>: it's from

01:01:43
<transcript>: It's from here.

01:01:49
<transcript>: Healthy style.

01:01:52
<transcript>: With 100.

01:01:55
<transcript>: 100%.

01:02:00
<transcript>: That works. Okay. So that worked.

01:02:00
<transcript>: so

01:02:03
<transcript>: So why is the lapse percentage? Not what working.

01:02:09
<transcript>: Why.

01:02:09
<transcript>: is that not working

01:02:11
<transcript>: Is that not working.

01:02:11
<transcript>: feel like

01:02:12
<transcript>: Feel like that should be working.

01:02:19
<transcript>: I don't know what these airs I'm getting about.

01:02:22
<transcript>: I already did so true. What.

01:02:28
<transcript>: Okay.

01:02:33
<transcript>: Am I going crazy style. So let's just look at this.

01:02:41
<transcript>: One style with 0%.

01:02:41
<transcript>: why is that

01:02:43
<transcript>: Why is that? Zero.

01:02:46
<transcript>: Elapsed, is that the right thing.

01:02:49
<transcript>: Elapsed.

01:02:49
<transcript>: set el

01:02:51
<transcript>: Set Elapsed, right.

01:03:00
<transcript>: Oh, wait, wait. Maybe I'm not setting a lapse because this is current that matches guessing. Okay.

01:03:14
<transcript>: Let's just set it all the time and let's just see.

01:03:21
<transcript>: Okay, it's working. So the question is Greetings, Profits, TV, Greetings.

01:03:24
<transcript>: How are you.

01:03:30
<transcript>: Timers working when we guess it correctly. Like right here. This one is definitely.

01:03:30
<transcript>: i am

01:03:31
<transcript>: I am.

01:03:31
<transcript>: it should

01:03:33
<transcript>: It should give us five more seconds. Right.

01:03:36
<transcript>: What is this one.

01:03:39
profitztv: Great here my friend.  How's the coding adventures going?

01:03:41
<transcript>: Nitro Enclaves. Probably. See, we're getting more time. It's working.

01:03:41
<transcript>: what is this one

01:03:42
<transcript>: What is this one.

01:03:45
<transcript>: Griffin? Oh, man? Running out of time.

01:03:51
<transcript>: Support. I don't know. So we lost 5 seconds there so it's expired. Okay.

01:03:51
<transcript>: basic

01:03:55
finitesingularity: Heyoo @adamdotdev!  Happy Thursday!

01:03:56
<transcript>: Basic gameplay is working. I think there's like four edge cases that I'm not handling.

01:03:56
<transcript>: but that's okay

01:03:58
<transcript>: But that's okay.

01:03:58
<transcript>: rep

01:03:59
<transcript>: Repost.

01:04:02
<transcript>: Correct.

01:04:08
<transcript>: I don't know. What is this? Transcribe.

01:04:12
<transcript>: I.

01:04:18
<transcript>: Code build what's wrong is the timer keeps going during that period where.

01:04:18
<transcript>: you're not able

01:04:20
<transcript>: You're not able to keep guessing.

01:04:20
<transcript>: that's

01:04:22
<transcript>: That's a problem that's Neptune.

01:04:22
<transcript>: so we got

01:04:29
<transcript>: So we got five more seconds. Maybe we need to make it. You get like seven more seconds or something to factor in that 2 seconds where you can't do anything.

01:04:34
<transcript>: Oh, Geez, I need to be what is this? Nimble studio.

01:04:34
<transcript>: oh

01:04:36
<transcript>: Oh lost 5 seconds.

01:04:43
<transcript>: Inspector. Oh, I got five more seconds. So this is kind of fun. I kind of like it.

01:04:47
<transcript>: I got farmers, II.

01:05:04
<transcript>: Don't know. Oh, I got it. Okay. We need to add streaks. Translate, translate. We need to add streaks, and we need to do something else with the score. And we need to display everything a lot more visually appealing. I'm still going, Guys, I'm still going.

01:05:05
thdxr: wow how do you know these services

01:05:10
<transcript>: Lake Formation. Oh, okay. That was fun. Have a good time.

01:05:13
<transcript>: Profits of Coding Adventures are going.

01:05:33
<transcript>: Okay. I'm learning X state, which has been fun. We're learning the T three stack, which has been fun. I am excited to build this app with like I would say more of what I would typically build with because there's parts of this that it's just I'm so slow picking up some of these things and then the cold starts are so slow on Versaille.

01:05:53
<transcript>: And that's Prisma's fault. So I am excited to build this with another stack. We're gonna build this same app. Once I get the app figured out, we're kind of designing it as we go, like, I didn't really have, like, a plan for the app, but once we actually get it all built, we're gonna build it in another stack, maybe two or three more stacks just to, like, compare performance. And like, developer.

01:05:53
<transcript>: experience all

01:05:57
<transcript>: Experience all that stuff. So it's a good learning exercise. Finite.

01:05:57
<transcript>: hey oh happy

01:06:01
<transcript>: Hey, oh, Happy Thursday. How are you doing? Fine. I.

01:06:03
<transcript>: How do you know these services.

01:06:03
<transcript>: well some

01:06:05
<transcript>: Well, some of them you can just guess.

01:06:05
<transcript>: so this

01:06:13
haliphax: heya finite o/

01:06:21
akawr: akawrWave

01:06:24
<transcript>: So this is how I have all the AWS certs and how I did them on six weeks. I'm just really good at multiple choice, like, you can just kind of get right. You can look at the service name and kind of figure out what it's describing in the picture. I don't know all the services, some of them. I knew most of them. I'm just like that's gotta be that one. I get it wrong sometimes.

01:06:24

01:06:26

01:06:31
<transcript>: Hello, Binja? Oh, I need to do some shout out shout out finite singing.

01:06:32
profitztv: I have to use my 50/50 or phone a friend

01:06:34
finitesingularity: I'm doing well. Had a fantastic day yesterday (hit feature completeness on the app I've been developing for 5-years woot woot!)

01:06:36
<transcript>: And also shout out.

01:06:37

01:06:45
finitesingularity: @haliphax Good morning @haliphax! :)

01:06:46
<transcript>: Let's see. Let's come over here. Come on.

01:06:46
<transcript>: gonna be

01:06:52
<transcript>: Gonna be taking a pee break here shortly. Thanks for the follow EMIX Maxine.

01:06:52
<transcript>: you mix max

01:06:53
finitesingularity: @ProfitzTV How goes it Profitz?

01:06:54
akawr: shoutout you!

01:06:55
<transcript>: You mix maximum.

01:06:59
<transcript>: Drinking out of your Bowl Binja.

01:07:02
thdxr: Adam pees more than my puppy

01:07:05
profitztv: @FiniteSingularity coffee and working for the man. :)  you?

01:07:11
akawr: yeah, at the office now so no bowl 😔

01:07:18
<transcript>: I have to use my 50 50 or phone a friend. Now I have thought about like layering into this game more complicated things like that. We could have little like powerups and stuff like, you've got a an eliminated two of the options kind of thing. We also need to just make it harder.

01:07:20
<transcript>: By.

01:07:20
<transcript>: so

01:07:29
finitesingularity: @ProfitzTV Coffee and getting ready to work for the man.. LUL

01:07:40
<transcript>: So right now I'm just randomly choosing all four options, like the four services that we display. But what we should do is randomly choose, like, two of them, and then choose one that's in the same family as that service. Because so many of the times I see a blue icon, I know it's a database service, like, I know it's one of the database services. And then I just pick the one that's a database service. But what if there were two database services.

01:07:40
<transcript>: and i couldn't just

01:07:40
profitztv: @FiniteSingularity fun!  enjoy mate

01:07:46
<transcript>: And I couldn't just eliminate it that way. That make it so much harder for people like me who are super nerds.

01:07:50
<transcript>: Let's see. Good morning. Good morning, everybody.

01:07:54
<transcript>: I pee more than a puffy than your puffy.

akawr: i do video editing yeah

01:17:02
<transcript>: Is not very plugged in.

01:17:07
<transcript>: You do video editing.

01:17:16
<transcript>: Yeah. I wanted to start by, like, editing my own videos so I could learn all the like.

01:17:16
<transcript>: well what i

01:17:22
akawr: but i honestly don't have much time for it anymore, i used to make youtube videos

01:17:23
<transcript>: Well, what I want to lay out, kind of what is my style? How do I want to, like, put together videos on YouTube.

01:17:23
<transcript>: what kind of

01:17:25
<transcript>: What kind of define it first.

01:17:30
<transcript>: And then maybe hand it off to people. But, man, it's a lot of work.

01:17:30
akawr: started with lego stop motion at the age of 9/10

01:17:33
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:17:33
<transcript>: it's hard

01:17:34
<transcript>: It's Hard time.

01:17:39
<transcript>: Oh, you're right, right. Lego, stop motion. I remember talking about this.

01:17:42
<transcript>: On your stream.

01:17:42
<transcript>: all right

01:17:43
<transcript>: All right.

01:17:49
<transcript>: Just gonna go back to it. I've got the bad hair thing on that means everything's gonna be broken.

01:17:53
<transcript>: It's all broken.

01:17:53
<transcript>: i'm not even wearing

01:17:55

<transcript>: There's air.

01:17:57
<transcript>: let's see

01:18:00
<transcript>: Let's see. I'm gonna just fix that right now.

01:18:00
<transcript>: sorry

01:18:04
<transcript>: Sorry, GIGO 6000. Oh, there we go. Thanks. Dax.

01:18:04
<transcript>: glass

01:18:06
<transcript>: Glasses. They don't break things.

01:18:12
<transcript>: Okay, so we have the game working. There's one thing that's really annoying me.

01:18:14
<transcript>: That is.

01:18:14
<transcript>: when

01:18:21
<transcript>: When you when we go into one of the States, it's when we guess so when we do checking the answer. Yeah.

01:18:23
<transcript>: Here.

01:18:25
<transcript>: Why did I.

01:18:25
<transcript>: keep doing that

01:18:26
<transcript>: Keep doing that.

01:18:30
<transcript>: I can answer right here.

01:18:32
<transcript>: So we set the choice.

01:18:35
<transcript>: Cancel the timer.

01:18:42
<transcript>: It's at this point, right here, where we're showing.

01:18:42
<transcript>: that you

01:18:45
<transcript>: That you got the wrong answer.

01:18:47
akawr: you don't have to watch it now, but here's the reference i was talking about https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbZa69tIjoI&ab_channel=FilleHockey

01:18:47
<transcript>: We shouldn't.

01:18:50
akawr: the 70k check

01:18:52
<transcript>: So down here.

01:18:54
gigo6000: piemanCry piemanCry piemanCry

01:18:55
akawr: it's really popular

01:18:55
<transcript>: Let's see the button. It would be.

01:18:58
<transcript>: Yeah, this chosen.

01:19:02
<transcript>: The chosen is when it doesn't match. Guessing.

01:19:02
<transcript>: and the name

01:19:04
<transcript>: And the name.

01:19:04
<transcript>: equals

01:19:05
<transcript>: Equals.

01:19:07
<transcript>: Context choice.

01:19:13
<transcript>: What am I trying to get at here? I want to show.

01:19:15
<transcript>: I only want to show it during.

01:19:15
<transcript>: let's just forget

01:19:18
<transcript>: Let's just forget this. It's just.

01:19:21
<transcript>: We show the X or the well, no.

01:19:21
<transcript>: hang

01:19:31
<transcript>: Hang on. We don't just show it when you're in the state showing answer. We only show it if we're in the state showing answer. Okay, so up here.

01:19:34
<transcript>: 26k right here.

01:19:38
<transcript>: Instead of it being when it matches guessing it's gonna be when it.

01:19:39
bigdiff___: the keyboard button overlay thingy seems to be a little down

01:19:44
<transcript>: Instead of not matching guessing it's gonna be when it does match showing.

01:19:44
<transcript>: answer

01:19:46
<transcript>: Answer right.

01:19:50
<transcript>: That just fix it. Because that's all I needed to do.

01:19:56
<transcript>: So that's worked. Mail? Yeah, fixed it.

01:19:58
raestrict: Are you using vim in client or terminal?

01:20:07
<transcript>: Can I. The question is, can I click on things? No. Okay. I was making sure it was disabled. When? Okay. I gotta go fast.

01:20:07
<transcript>: local zones

01:20:08
<transcript>: Local zones.

01:20:14
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow go Haku. The problem is we're not showing a little TADA emoji. What is this.

01:20:17
<transcript>: I don't know.

01:20:17
<transcript>: transfer family

01:20:20
<transcript>: Transfer family. Oh, we're not showing the failed ones, either.

01:20:20
<transcript>: so

01:20:23
<transcript>: So we didn't completely fix it.

01:20:25
<transcript>: Cloud map? I don't know.

01:20:28
<transcript>: Looked like a map in a cloud.

01:20:28
<transcript>: that's a sh

01:20:30
<transcript>: That's a shield thing. Guard duty.

01:20:36
<transcript>: Text, of course.

01:20:36
<transcript>: so we're getting

01:20:42
<transcript>: So we're getting 5 seconds on each correct answer. I think maybe it should be a little more than that. Some of these are hard.

01:20:42
<transcript>: i don't

01:20:45
<transcript>: I don't know I don't know.

01:20:49
<transcript>: And that's a game over. Okay.

01:20:52
<transcript>: Are you using them in client or turn.

01:20:52
<transcript>: i'm

01:20:54
<transcript>: I'm using.

<transcript>: Plant or terminal.

01:20:59
<transcript>: does that

01:21:01
<transcript>: Does that answer your question? I'm not even sure.

01:21:09
<transcript>: Oh, the reference you're talking about. Okay.

01:21:13
<transcript>: I'm really curious what it's from.

01:21:17
<transcript>: Even if I don't watch the video, I need to know. What is it from.

01:21:24
<transcript>: Wolf of Wall Street. Got it. Yeah. I don't watch movies. I haven't watched movies since.

01:21:26
<transcript>: I don't know.

01:21:26
<transcript>: some we had

01:21:30
akawr: me neither, but that's one i was forced to watch

01:21:32
<transcript>: Some. We had kids. My wife doesn't really like movies either. I watched a ton of movies growing up.

01:21:32
<transcript>: my wife's not really

01:21:36
<transcript>: My wife's not really into it. So now I'm not really into it. Just kind of how it works.

01:21:41
<transcript>: The keyboard button overlay thing seems to be a little down. Uhoh.

01:21:41
<transcript>: oh

01:21:45
<transcript>: Oh like you're not seeing my I am.

01:21:48
<transcript>: Where does it need to be.

01:21:52
<transcript>: Right there.

01:21:57
akawr: a bit further up

01:21:58
<transcript>: Okay, so chosen.

01:22:06
<transcript>: It's when we're showing answer and the name equals the choice. So the name of the okay.

01:22:06
<transcript>: and

01:22:08
<transcript>: And then.

01:22:08
<transcript>: state

01:22:09
<transcript>: State.

01:22:09
<transcript>: current

01:22:13
<transcript>: Current matches guessing undefined else.

01:22:13
<transcript>: when

01:22:19
<transcript>: When the result, when the answer equals that success, else it's error.

01:22:19
<transcript>: okay what

01:22:20
<transcript>: Okay. What.

01:22:27
raestrict: I’m using vim in client (neovide) but I think you’re using classic terminal vim

01:22:28
<transcript>: So.

01:22:37
<transcript>: We're passing shows and down into the component. What do we do with it down here.

01:22:43
<transcript>: Oh, we're changing the color? Yeah, Yeah.

01:22:43
<transcript>: i kind of

01:22:45
<transcript>: I kind of hate how I did this.

01:22:53
<transcript>: Like I'm starting to think it shouldn't be a separate component. Should just be all right there.

01:23:05
<transcript>: 's.

01:23:15
<transcript>: Using them in client Neovad. But I think using classic terminal BIM.

01:23:15
<transcript>: maybe

01:23:17
<transcript>: Maybe.

01:23:22
<transcript>: I'm just run new of them.

01:23:25
<transcript>: From my turn.

01:23:30
<transcript>: On the I didn't know there was a client mode.

01:23:42
thdxr: are there any advantages to client mode

01:23:46
<transcript>: Activate.

01:23:50
<transcript>: It's not showing the state here.

01:23:54
<transcript>: Is it showing answer? Did I mess that up.

01:23:56
<transcript>: Yeah, it's showing answer.

01:24:05
<transcript>: Give a follows Ecos and jaguzz.

01:24:10
<transcript>: And go, Haku, sorry, I bet you'd all of your names.

01:24:20
<transcript>: Chosen not true here current not matches showing answer.

01:24:20
<transcript>: and

01:24:22
<transcript>: And see name.

01:24:22
<transcript>: thank

01:24:26
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow Nano Nanos.

01:24:29
<transcript>: All the followers rolling in.

01:24:33
<transcript>: Oh, my word, DAX. Thank you for the follow.

01:24:34
<transcript>: following

01:24:34
<transcript>: Following.

01:24:38
<transcript>: Now people are just unfollowing me and refolowing me.

01:24:46
<transcript>: Apparently chosen is false.

01:24:46
<transcript>: i would expect

01:24:48
<transcript>: I would expect it to be true.

01:24:48
<transcript>: like

01:24:50
<transcript>: Like we're in.

01:24:54
<transcript>: Showing answer as soon as a snowmobile.

01:24:54
<transcript>: we're in the show

01:24:55
<transcript>: We're in the showing answer state.

01:24:58
<transcript>: We shouldn't make the timer key going.

01:25:03
<transcript>: Right.

01:25:07
<transcript>: Let's stop with showing answer state.

01:25:12
<transcript>: the timer should only be moving

01:25:13
<transcript>: This should only be moving.

01:25:16
<transcript>: If.

01:25:18
<transcript>: We're not.

01:25:20
niftynate80: I would never leave or unfollow you. I would never run around and hurt you

01:25:23
<transcript>: For not guessing or it should only be moving when we're guessing right.

01:25:27
<transcript>: Oh, that's step. Functions.

01:25:33
<transcript>: What else? Sage Maker. I need to figure out what else is bad here. It just. It shouldn't be moving.

01:25:33
<transcript>: i think we

01:25:37
<transcript>: I think we should give you 7 seconds instead of five.

01:25:43
<transcript>: And it shouldn't be moved when you're not. That's what I was trying to do up here. I was trying to conditionally.

01:25:47
<transcript>: Only settle APS if we're guessing.

01:25:50
<transcript>: I don't know why it wasn't working if.

01:25:50
<transcript>: value

01:25:51
<transcript>: Value.

01:26:02
<transcript>: Works.

01:26:05
<transcript>: Why it wasn't working.

01:26:07
<transcript>: Definitely isn't working.

01:26:12
<transcript>: So we're guessing and it's not updating that value. Why is it red? Also.

01:26:17
raestrict: Scrolling is smoother on pixel basis using buffers instead of per line, animations so it’s more of an aesthetic thing but scrolling is easier on my eyes

01:26:18
<transcript>: What is value.

01:26:20
raestrict: @thdxr

01:26:22
<transcript>: Uncle that long value.

01:26:24
<transcript>: That's the state value, but maybe not.

01:26:32
<transcript>: Oh, it's like active guessing. Okay, so then why doesn't this work.

01:26:34
thdxr: I'll try it

01:26:35
<transcript>: Why doesn't.

01:26:35
<transcript>: current

01:26:38
<transcript>: Current matches.

01:26:41
<transcript>: Guessing work.

01:26:44
<transcript>: Does It work.

01:26:50
<transcript>: Also why.

01:26:53
<transcript>: Do I get those errors? I don't know what those are.

01:27:02
<transcript>: Something locked up there.

01:27:07
<transcript>: Okay. So it's not not updating when we're on guessing.

01:27:21
<transcript>: State.

01:27:25
<transcript>: Value active guessing.

01:27:30
<transcript>: My typing guessing wrong.

01:27:30
<transcript>: that'd be funny

01:27:32
<transcript>: That'd be funny.

01:27:35
<transcript>: Guessing that's right.

01:27:44
<transcript>: I would never leave runfall you I would never run around and hurt you.

01:27:44
<transcript>: i was

01:27:46
<transcript>: I was gonna Nifty.

01:27:46
<transcript>: it's a good one

01:27:48
<transcript>: It's a good one.

01:27:48
<transcript>: and

01:27:50
<transcript>: And heard you. Oh, that might be music.

01:28:05
<transcript>: I don't know why this isn't working it bothers me I wonder maybe current oh maybe current isn't.

01:28:11
<transcript>: Triggering a REIT. Now that's not it.

01:28:11
<transcript>: it's like

01:28:23
<transcript>: It's like the current that comes into this is not. No, it's right. It's it's guessing. So why is current matches? Let's do this. Let's log current matches.

01:28:27
<transcript>: Like that.

01:28:27
<transcript>: right

01:28:28
<transcript>: Right. So see what's.

01:28:34
<transcript>: False.

01:28:34
<transcript>: clearly

01:28:35
<transcript>: Clearly.

01:28:38
<transcript>: Clearly, that's false.

01:28:38
<transcript>: i don't

01:28:41
<transcript>: I don't understand, I don't understand.

01:28:41
<transcript>: and i

01:28:43
<transcript>: And I don't like it.

01:29:17
<transcript>: Okay. Maybe we could do it differently.

01:29:26
<transcript>: And we could do it differently.

01:29:28
<transcript>: Let's think about this.

01:30:01
wesleycoder: for sure it has to do with the setInterval callback losing the context because useEffect is a hell when used with setInterval

01:30:06
<transcript>: Why am I getting this machine is gonna use machine has changed between renders.

01:30:11
<transcript>: Please make sure.

01:30:16
<transcript>: I mean I'm passing gaming machine. It's always the same right.

01:30:21
<transcript>: Always the same.

01:30:25
<transcript>: What's that about.

01:30:29
<transcript>: Like if I hard refresh the page, it goes away.

01:30:32
<transcript>: But that doesn't inspire confidence.

01:30:43
<transcript>: Oh Wesley, for sure it has to do with the set interval callback losing the context because use effect is a hell when used with that interval. Okay.

01:30:50
<transcript>: That makes sense. That is what my intuition said. I was just not smart enough to put it into words.

01:30:55
<transcript>: So.

01:31:05
<transcript>: Maybe I shouldn't be doing that is what I'm taking from that.

01:31:05
<transcript>: follow

01:31:08
<transcript>: Follow Baltic coder.

01:31:08
<transcript>: i shouldn't be

01:31:11
<transcript>: I shouldn't be doing said interval inside of a use effect.

01:31:19
<transcript>: Have an I have an idea.

01:31:21
<transcript>: Have an idea.

01:31:25
<transcript>: Excuse me.

01:31:29
<transcript>: Instead of a progress bar, which is dumb. Let's do.

01:31:34
<transcript>: A little like clock with seconds ticking down. And that way you can visualize.

01:31:34
<transcript>: when we add

01:31:37
<transcript>: When we add seconds, it'll be like, plus five. And like.

01:31:40
<transcript>: I don't know if that'll fix my issue.

01:31:42
<transcript>: But I like it better.

01:31:48
<transcript>: Yeah, I like that better.

01:31:57
<transcript>: It doesn't fix my issue at all, though.

01:32:11
<transcript>: Let's go down here I want to fix? I broke some things I'm gonna fix them. I should be seeing these little icons chosen as apparently no longer true.

01:32:13
<transcript>: Front that matches showing answer.

01:32:15
wesleycoder: It won't fix the issue, but would be nice too

01:32:23
<transcript>: Why is that not working? Now.

01:32:29
<transcript>: Working.

01:32:48
<transcript>: False, false, false falls false? And then I click one, and one of them should be true? Nope? They're all so false.

01:32:51
<transcript>: Hey.

01:33:01
<transcript>: Maybe. Am I missing something up with using the Inspector. Is the Inspector braking thing.

01:33:07
<transcript>: Yeah? I'm gonna make that change.

01:33:21
<transcript>: I'll make that change to use a timer with seconds and set of the progress bar. That's just better, but I gotta figure out what's going on here. Can I not do current matches inside of my render like this.

01:33:23
<transcript>: Is there a reason that that doesn't work.

01:33:26
<transcript>: I don't understand.

01:33:35
<transcript>: When will react? Makes sense to me. We're eight years in people. When am I gonna understand react and just like, get it.

01:33:36
wesleycoder: I would advise to look into some libs for dealing with timers in React.  I never really succeeded in using setInterval correctly in React with low effort.  Maybe this would fit your use case: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-timer-hook

01:33:50
<transcript>: I would advise to look into some Libs for dealing with timers and react never really succeeded in using said interval correctly in react with low effort. Maybe this would fit your case. React timer hook. Oh, interesting.

01:33:56
<transcript>: I didn't think about like needing a library for a timer, but I guess.

01:33:56
<transcript>: i could very

01:33:56
thdxr: I think the simplest thing to fix this issue is to switch to solid

01:33:59
<transcript>: I could very well be using used interval wrong.

01:34:03
<transcript>: So how does this work? Expiry time stamp.

01:34:11
wesleycoder: Maybe after 20 years we will all start to understand react

01:34:11
<transcript>: It gives you seconds, minutes, hours. Days. Is running. Start. Pause. Resume. Start.

01:34:11
<transcript>: oh interesting

01:34:14
<transcript>: Oh, interesting. Hey, this is nice. I like this.

01:34:23
<transcript>: So I give it the time stamps that expires wonderful. And I get back.

01:34:23
<transcript>: i

01:34:26
<transcript>: I have a callback for on expire.

01:34:34
<transcript>: I like this.

01:34:36
<transcript>: I do.

01:34:42
<transcript>: You stop watch so I can I get the remaining.

01:34:47
<transcript>: Days, hours, minute, seconds. I can start. Stop, resume.

01:34:47
<transcript>: pause

01:34:48
<transcript>: Pause.

01:34:53
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:34:55
<transcript>: Right.

01:34:58
<transcript>: This seems good.

01:35:01
<transcript>: Last publishing a year ago. I mean.

01:35:01
<transcript>: seems

01:35:04
<transcript>: Seems pretty like simple of a thing.

01:35:09
<transcript>: 13 months ago.

01:35:12
<transcript>: Six months ago.

01:35:14
<transcript>: Okay.

01:35:15
<transcript>: Why not.

01:35:19
<transcript>: Why not? Why not.

01:35:25
<transcript>: I like it. I'm gonna grab it.

01:35:28
<transcript>: You react timer, hook.

01:35:38
<transcript>: Okay. Then I'm gonna go up here.

01:35:41
<transcript>: I'm gonna.

01:35:41
<transcript>: say

01:35:42
<transcript>: Say.

01:35:44
<transcript>: Import.

01:35:44
<transcript>: use

01:35:46
<transcript>: Use timer.

01:35:51
<transcript>: From React timer, book.

01:35:54
<transcript>: Oh, what did I do with the equal there.

01:35:58
<transcript>: Use timer.

01:35:58
<transcript>: and

01:36:00
<transcript>: And then.

01:36:00
<transcript>: down

01:36:02
<transcript>: Down here I'm gonna use.

01:36:02
<transcript>: timer

01:36:03
<transcript>: Timer.

01:36:12
<transcript>: Equals use timer.

01:36:18
<transcript>: Oh, I guess this is gonna be based on.

01:36:18
<transcript>: let's see

01:36:19
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:36:22
<transcript>: Based on something in the context. Right.

01:36:30
<transcript>: So use timer we pass in.

01:36:30
<transcript>: an expiry

01:36:33
<transcript>: An Expiry time stamp which is contact.

01:36:37
<transcript>: Game expires.

01:36:42
<transcript>: Eight or unfind, is not o.

01:36:48
<transcript>: I gotta handle the case where there's no game yet.

01:36:54
<transcript>: And it's a hook so I can't make a conditional. What do I do here? We'll just say, like.

01:36:56
<transcript>: We default to.

01:37:00
<transcript>: I don't know. Some really far off time, right.

01:37:03
<transcript>: Or just.

01:37:03
<transcript>: now

01:37:04
<transcript>: Now.

01:37:09
<transcript>: Like it expires immediately.

01:37:09
<transcript>: it doesn't matter

01:37:11
<transcript>: It doesn't matter if there's no game yet. Probably not.

01:37:17
<transcript>: Okay.

01:37:17
<transcript>: so

01:37:20
<transcript>: So then we're gonna say we want the start.

01:37:22
<transcript>: The pause.

01:37:25
<transcript>: Resume.

01:37:32
<transcript>: And then we want the minutes and seconds.

01:37:32
<transcript>: no

01:37:35
<transcript>: No, just seconds. It's not gonna have minutes.

01:37:37
<transcript>: Okay.

01:37:37
<transcript>: and then maybe

01:37:40
<transcript>: And then maybe I'll just display the second somewhere down here.

01:37:48
<transcript>: Let's do.

01:37:51
<transcript>: Seconds.

01:37:57
<transcript>: Okay.

01:38:01
<transcript>: Okay, let's try this. So we want to start the timer.

01:38:05
<transcript>: Win. So we're getting rid of all this.

01:38:12
<transcript>: I want to start the timer.

01:38:17
<transcript>: When we go into new game.

01:38:19
<transcript>: Where is that.

01:38:38
<transcript>: Client side timer. It's just for the user experience. It's not authoritative.

01:38:38
<transcript>: i still

01:38:43
<transcript>: I still need to know oh, here we go. Hand it. So when we send start game, we'll just do it right here we'll do.

01:38:50
<transcript>: Our timer right there. Okay. So then theoretically.

01:38:53
<transcript>: Delete that whole function, right.

01:38:59
<transcript>: That delete.

01:39:03
<transcript>: Looks. I can't like delete hooks.

01:39:03
<transcript>: that

01:39:05
<transcript>: That no DAP.

01:39:07
<transcript>: I know. Okay.

01:39:07
<transcript>: let's try this

01:39:08
<transcript>: Let's try this.

01:39:08
<transcript>: oh

01:39:10
<transcript>: Oh.

01:39:13
<transcript>: I didn't want to delete that. Yeah. There we go.

01:39:16
<transcript>: Okay.

01:39:21
<transcript>: That feels good not using effect anymore.

01:39:24
<transcript>: Feels good.

01:39:28
<transcript>: Not using value.

01:39:42
<transcript>: Where are we using a lapse here. Okay, so this timer bar. I'm just gonna comment this out for now.

01:39:44
<transcript>: Okay.

01:39:46
<transcript>: Cool.

01:39:46
<transcript>: let's see what

01:39:48
<transcript>: Let's see what that did.

01:39:48
<transcript>: we should

01:39:51
<transcript>: We should be starting a timer when we click new game.

01:39:58
<transcript>: I think the simplest thing to fix this issue is to switch to Solid. I agree tox I would like to switch to solid.

01:40:03
<transcript>: Really would if we put everything into the state machine. We could then switch over to solid use the state machine.

01:40:06
<transcript>: It'll just be easy, right.

01:40:16
<transcript>: Maybe after 20 years, we will all start to understand, react. Exactly. But it's not. It's not.

01:40:18
<transcript>: React fault.

01:40:18
<transcript>: we

01:40:21
<transcript>: We just start bad at understanding things.

01:40:24
<transcript>: 0 second, so that's not ideal.

01:40:27
<transcript>: So our timers not.

01:40:38
<transcript>: Use timer context game expires so that should change oh can that not be like dynamic.

01:40:38
<transcript>: ooh

01:40:40
<transcript>: Ooh.

01:40:40
<transcript>: ooh

01:40:41
<transcript>: Ooh.

01:40:45
<transcript>: Oh can restart maybe we can.

01:40:48
<transcript>: Maybe we can do this.

01:40:51
<transcript>: Restart.

01:41:00
<transcript>: And make can we restart with a new time after every answer or something? I don't like that this lives outside of my state machine, but.

01:41:02
<transcript>: We'll answer.

01:41:08
<transcript>: We're gonna restart the timer.

01:41:08
<transcript>: i send it

01:41:10
<transcript>: I send it time now.

01:41:10
<transcript>: yeah

01:41:13
<transcript>: Yeah new expiry time Sam cool.

01:41:19
<transcript>: But I guess I don't want to do this here. I want to do it.

01:41:27
<transcript>: I want to do this after the answer comes back.

01:41:32
<transcript>: You know, I'm saying.

01:41:35
<transcript>: What I'm saying here.

01:41:40
<transcript>: When the answer comes back, is there a way for me to get.

01:41:40
<transcript>: could i be using

01:41:45
<transcript>: Could I be using this hook? Somehow. I could be using this inside.

01:41:45
<transcript>: yeah yeah

01:41:47
<transcript>: Yeah, yeah. Inside the machine. Right.

01:41:50
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:41:55
<transcript>: Watch, watch, me.

01:41:57
<transcript>: Okay.

01:42:02
<transcript>: Watch me do it.

01:42:14
<transcript>: So I can't do this. The initial timestamp is just gonna be.

01:42:17
<transcript>: I'm not passive.

01:42:17
<transcript>: no it's got

01:42:19
<transcript>: No, it's got to be passed.

01:42:19
<transcript>: it's

01:42:21
<transcript>: It's gonna be the delete.

01:42:21
<transcript>: new

01:42:23
<transcript>: New.

01:42:31
<transcript>: Just gonna be new date. It's just gonna expire immediately, and that's fine. But when we're gonna we're gonna update it here.

01:42:39
<transcript>: Back up.

01:42:53
<transcript>: Start answer. Here we go. So we resolved the response. This is where we're gonna do something with our timer. I don't know if this is bad practice.

01:42:59
<transcript>: I don't know I just never do know with react we're gonna restart the timer here.

01:42:59
<transcript>: with

01:43:01
<transcript>: With the response.

01:43:01
<transcript>: game

01:43:05
<transcript>: Game expires. Okay.

01:43:07
<transcript>: Haha haha.

01:43:10
<transcript>: Feels good.

01:43:13
<transcript>: And then.

01:43:15
wesleycoder: That is expected when using xstate in react

01:43:15
<transcript>: We need to also.

01:43:15
<transcript>: we need to

01:43:17
<transcript>: We need to do it.

01:43:21
<transcript>: On start as well, don't we.

01:43:25
<transcript>: Yeah, we knew. They're right here.

01:43:28
<transcript>: So restart.

01:43:32
<transcript>: Game expires. Okay.

01:43:36
<transcript>: That works. Can I just do this.

01:43:44
wesleycoder: passing function calls into the services is ok

01:43:47
<transcript>: That is expected when using xDate and react. It's expected that you'll have to 28. 27. Look at this. Look at it.

01:43:47
<transcript>: look at it

01:43:48
<transcript>: Look at it.

01:43:54
<transcript>: Sometimes you just got to look at it. Got 20 seconds. I gotta go fast.

01:43:54
<transcript>: quick sight

01:43:55
<transcript>: Quick sight.

01:43:55
<transcript>: cloud search

01:44:00
<transcript>: Cloud search. Ooh, that one is tough because there's two. There Castler. It didn't give me five more seconds.

01:44:01
niftynate80: Just tuned in to the code. Do you need context ? useState is well suited for a simple timer

01:44:02
<transcript>: That's unfortunate.

01:44:10
<transcript>: Code artifact. Oh, it did give me five more seconds. It did. I just need to give myself more than five more seconds.

01:44:17
<transcript>: Tools. And I don't know. What is this? Fin space.

01:44:17
<transcript>: yeah

01:44:19
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

01:44:23
<transcript>: We just did this one cloud search. Yeah.

01:44:23
<transcript>: so we're getting

01:44:30
<transcript>: So we're getting five more seconds. Our score. All of this is styled horribly, just like Terribly Marketplace dark.

01:44:35
<transcript>: I am no Directory service.

01:44:42
<transcript>: We're getting down to the wire here. Comprehend. Oh, I don't know.

01:44:42
<transcript>: oh i got it

01:44:44
<transcript>: Oh, I got it. 5 seconds.

01:44:54
<transcript>: Just tuned into the code. Do you need context use state as well suited for a simple timer.

01:45:03
<transcript>: Do I need context? I'm not using sorry context. If you see context, that's the.

01:45:03
<transcript>: ext

01:45:04
<transcript>: Ext.

01:45:11
<transcript>: I don't use react context. I have not desire to use react context.

01:45:16
<transcript>: Passing function calls into the service is okay, cool.

01:45:19
niftynate80: Ohhhhhh I have never used x state

01:45:21
<transcript>: Well, this feels pretty good. Thanks for the follow, Bronson. I don't know if I ever saw that.

01:45:23
caldotjs: hey stream! will lurk for a while (the doggo needs to poop :D)

01:45:26
niftynate80: Have to try it

01:45:28
<transcript>: Hey Kyle, that will work for a while.

01:45:30
<transcript>: I totally get it.

01:45:31
wesleycoder: You can pause the timer when showing the result and resuming after, this way you gain a few secs

01:45:47
<transcript>: Yeah. Actually, it's been pretty fun. I like how little like it's helping me use a lot of the react hooks less, which feels good because I might want to build this thing in solid just as a learning exercise. And then I can just, like, drop this whole state machine in it may just it might just work. That'd be cool.

01:45:52
<transcript>: Okay, so we no longer need the Elapsed thing.

01:46:01
<transcript>: We just have a countdown timer. Now I want to figure out we still we broke this thing down here.

01:46:04
<transcript>: I want to delete all this.

01:46:09
<transcript>: So down here.

01:46:12
<transcript>: We broke, we broke chosen.

01:46:12
<transcript>: this

01:46:16
<transcript>: This I guess I can't do current matches showing answer here.

01:46:16
<transcript>: yes

01:46:17
<transcript>: Yes.

01:46:21
niftynate80: @caldotjs HeyGuys

01:46:21
<transcript>: I don't understand why I can't do that.

01:46:21
<transcript>: what was i doing before

01:46:23
<transcript>: What was I doing before.

01:46:23
<transcript>: value

01:46:24
<transcript>: Value.

01:46:27
<transcript>: Was I didn't value.

01:46:31
<transcript>: Value equals.

01:46:38
<transcript>: Or what was it? Value equals showing answer.

01:46:42
<transcript>: Oh value I'm not.

01:46:51
<transcript>: Where are you? Right here.

01:47:02
<transcript>: Does that work.

01:47:08
<transcript>: Auto scaling.

01:47:15
<transcript>: Transit gateway.

01:47:16
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:47:16
<transcript>: wait what

01:47:17
niftynate80: ok i see this is a big giant x-state exercise. it has nothing to do with react

01:47:22
<transcript>: Wait. What? It's not working, is it? I didn't even pay attention. I just got I caught up in the game. Waff.

01:47:26
<transcript>: Yeah, it's not working, so chosen. Still not working.

01:47:26
<transcript>: so

01:47:28
<transcript>: So why can't I do this.

01:47:32
<transcript>: I like it.

01:47:36
<transcript>: I don't like it.

01:47:42
<transcript>: So what can I use here? We've got current matches checking, answer.

01:47:42
<transcript>: show

01:47:44
<transcript>: Showing answer.

01:47:51
<transcript>: I don't understand the problem here. Why can't I use.

01:47:58
<transcript>: Like every time current changes.

01:48:01
<transcript>: It's gonna render right.

01:48:03
wesleycoder: Is Showing Answer correctly typed?

01:48:04
<transcript>: Right.

01:48:05
caldotjs: @niftynate80 HeyGuys

01:48:18
<transcript>: Changes. We should get a rerender.

01:48:21
<transcript>: And this all should run again. Right.

01:48:26
<transcript>: Context Round at Choices mat.

01:48:32
<transcript>: Oh.

01:48:32
<transcript>: current that matches

01:48:38
<transcript>: Current that matches active this whole thing is only rendered when current that matches active.

01:48:38
<transcript>: current

01:48:40
<transcript>: Current can't.

01:48:40
<transcript>: it

01:48:45
<transcript>: It's like subnet. Okay, submachines. So if we do X state.

01:48:45
<transcript>: sub

01:48:48
<transcript>: Submachine matches.

01:48:51
<transcript>: There's something I'm missing. Here.

01:48:51
<transcript>: hire girl

01:48:53
<transcript>: Hire Girl State notes Here we go.

01:48:58
<transcript>: Compound States.

01:49:02
<transcript>: So.

01:49:12
niftynate80: this is super duper types nerd x-state space

01:49:19
<transcript>: What I'm gonna know is when I do matches.

01:49:26
<transcript>: Statements State Methods and Properties State matches.

01:49:32
<transcript>: Current.

01:49:32
<transcript>: that matches

01:49:33
<transcript>: That matches.

01:49:44
niftynate80: at least when i saw david piano doing x-state and the other TS guy. it was all about crazy typings

01:49:45
<transcript>: No, I'm not getting types. Wesley. I don't. I think I didn't do the schema. I think that's I have to do the schema.

01:49:51
<transcript>: I think.

01:49:54
<transcript>: I'm.

01:49:54
<transcript>: yeah

01:49:56
<transcript>: Yeah? I need to do.

01:50:00
<transcript>: Find a schema and that would give me.

01:50:00
<transcript>: the types on

01:50:01
<transcript>: The types on these things.

01:50:03
<transcript>: I should do that.

01:50:05
<transcript>: Create me.

01:50:11
<transcript>: Looking for current dot.

01:50:23
<transcript>: X Eight Current stop Matches submachine.

01:50:30
<transcript>: State is an abstract reset.

01:50:31
vinny_code: I think it is dot notation… so it should be current.matches(‘active.{otherkey}”)

01:50:38
<transcript>: Matches.

01:50:41
<transcript>: Parent state value.

01:50:41
<transcript>: determines whether

01:50:46
<transcript>: Determines whether the current state value is a subset of the given parent state value.

01:50:51
<transcript>: Oh, red dot stop. So I have to, like, active dot.

01:50:51
<transcript>: ahhh

01:50:54
<transcript>: Ahhh active AHA.

01:50:58
<transcript>: So everywhere I'm doing these matches? I'm doing it wrong.

01:51:04
<transcript>: Idle, game over and active. Those are all correct.

01:51:08
<transcript>: But these should be like.

01:51:13
<transcript>: Active showing answer this one should be active.

01:51:16
<transcript>: Guessing so we learned something new.

01:51:18
<transcript>: We learned.

01:51:21
<transcript>: You have to do this.

01:51:29
<transcript>: Is good. I like when I learned something. At least we learned something.

01:51:32
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:51:32
<transcript>: think of the

01:51:33
<transcript>: Think of the follow.

01:51:33
<transcript>: follow

01:51:36
<transcript>: Follows Alejandro and.

01:51:38
<transcript>: See if it worked.

01:51:40
<transcript>: This is.

01:51:42
<transcript>: I don't know. Code deploy.

01:51:42
<transcript>: yes

01:51:44
<transcript>: Yes, it worked.

01:51:47
<transcript>: This is an FSX service.

01:51:49
<transcript>: Quite confident.

01:51:52
<transcript>: What is.

01:51:52
<transcript>: that

01:51:53
<transcript>: That.

01:51:53
<transcript>: actually i want to

01:51:58
<transcript>: Actually, I want to guess wrong on purpose. I don't know what that one is, but I'm gonna guess wrong just make sure yeah, everything looks good.

01:51:58
<transcript>: translate

01:52:03
<transcript>: Translate should get five more seconds. So we got to do, like a little plus five animation.

01:52:05
<transcript>: What is this.

01:52:12
<transcript>: The Workspace's Web. I don't know. Virtual private cloud. Really? That's the VPC logo. Dynamodb.

01:52:12
<transcript>: one of my favorite

01:52:15
<transcript>: One of my favorites? Oh, we got 5 seconds? Oh, we're down to down to the wire.

01:52:15
<transcript>: i don't even know

01:52:18
<transcript>: I don't even know. I'm just gonna click on something, okay? We lost.

01:52:24
<transcript>: We're figuring stuff out. This is good.

01:52:24
wesleycoder: Yay, it workx adamdo8DealWithIt adamdo8DealWithIt adamdo8DealWithIt

01:52:30
<transcript>: That notation. So we current matches active. Yes, that's right. That's right. Vinny. We figured it out.

01:52:30
<transcript>: we figured

01:52:32
<transcript>: We figured it out.

01:52:32
<transcript>: feels good

01:52:34
<transcript>: Feels good.

01:52:38
<transcript>: This is no Time for Andrew bird.

01:52:42
<transcript>: No time for.

01:52:42
<transcript>: downer music

01:52:48
<transcript>: Downer music should we go in and define a schema so that we have types on all this stuff that would have helped me in this instance.

01:52:48
<transcript>: i'm kind of naked

01:52:50
<transcript>: I'm kind of naked without a schema.

01:52:50
<transcript>: let's

01:52:57
<transcript>: Let's do it. Let's do it. The whole point of this thing is to learn. So schemas.

01:53:04
<transcript>: Xd is written in TypeScript.

01:53:12
<transcript>: So here we go. Schema. We have context. We have events. And then there's other things we can put in there as well. Like.

01:53:23
<transcript>: Typing Promise Services. That's not even what I want. I want.

01:53:27
<transcript>: Do I have to use code? Gen? I don't understand this.

01:53:27
<transcript>: maybe

01:53:29
<transcript>: Maybe I should read.

01:53:39
<transcript>: Do you solo when you're defining a machine config object outside of the Create machine function.

01:53:46
<transcript>: This is what I'm doing right now. I've got the context in the event type.

01:53:52
<transcript>: States okay the shape of the overall state context based on the state value.

01:54:00
<transcript>: Here's. What I need to do that I haven't done yet. Right.

01:54:05
<transcript>: So we're doing contacts and game event.

01:54:05
<transcript>: we need

01:54:08
<transcript>: We need to also add type States.

01:54:11
<transcript>: Let's just do this.

01:54:20
<transcript>: But it's not gonna be user type state it's gonna be game.

01:54:27
<transcript>: So these are the different States we can get into.

01:54:33
<transcript>: There is an idol. The context would look like what.

01:54:37
<transcript>: During idle the context would be like.

01:54:37
<transcript>: just everything

01:54:39
<transcript>: Just everything. Undefined. Right.

01:54:44
<transcript>: So it would be.

01:54:46
<transcript>: Game undefined.

01:54:49
<transcript>: Round undefined.

01:54:51
<transcript>: And then.

01:54:55
<transcript>: Result undefined.

01:55:01
<transcript>: Choice. Undefined. I think it's all undefined at this stage, right.

01:55:01
<transcript>: so

01:55:09
<transcript>: So idle I don't even know why I did context and that it's just it's just bad and then value.

01:55:09
<transcript>: active

01:55:10
<transcript>: Active.

01:55:14
<transcript>: Active is going to be a context.

01:55:21
<transcript>: But active is going to be let's see.

01:55:21
<transcript>: context

01:55:23
<transcript>: Context, and.

01:55:25
<transcript>: Game.

01:55:25
<transcript>: is

01:55:28
<transcript>: Is a game.

01:55:30
<transcript>: Ran.

01:55:32
<transcript>: Is around.

01:55:37
<transcript>: There is no result. Oh, I'm sorry. No.

01:55:41
<transcript>: The substance? How do you model substates here.

01:55:41
<transcript>: comp

01:55:44
<transcript>: Compound States Here we go.

01:55:46
<transcript>: So parent.

01:55:52
<transcript>: And then this one is like Value Parent child.

01:55:52
<transcript>: oh i see

01:55:54
<transcript>: Oh, I see.

01:55:54
<transcript>: so

01:56:00
<transcript>: So there's active. I don't know if active. I think it acted. It should always have a game and around.

01:56:03
<transcript>: Starting. I didn't do that one.

01:56:06
<transcript>: Starting.

01:56:06
<transcript>: i guess looks

01:56:08
<transcript>: I guess. Looks just like.

01:56:08
<transcript>: i

01:56:10
<transcript>: I don't.

01:56:15
<transcript>: Put anything on the context.

01:56:20
<transcript>: Active.

01:56:20
<transcript>: has always

01:56:26
<transcript>: Has always has a game in around but then there's gonna be substates like.

01:56:29
<transcript>: Value.

01:56:29
<transcript>: what

01:56:31
<transcript>: What is it? It's like.

01:56:34
<transcript>: Value.

01:56:34
<transcript>: activ

01:56:36
<transcript>: Active.

01:56:38
<transcript>: Guessing.

01:56:44
<transcript>: And the context on that.

01:56:50
<transcript>: Value and then.

01:56:54
<transcript>: Context. Is context.

01:56:54
<transcript>: and

01:56:56
<transcript>: And.

01:57:03
<transcript>: Just saying that we have to have a game in around at this stage.

01:57:05
<transcript>: Right.

01:57:10
<transcript>: Okay.

01:57:18
<transcript>: Then we have another one. Let's just I'm actually gonna just.

01:57:21
<transcript>: Leave those and Let's.

01:57:21
<transcript>: let's copy

01:57:22
<transcript>: Let's copy.

01:57:28
<transcript>: Right.

01:57:31
<transcript>: Oh, Jeez.

01:57:39
<transcript>: Then active. We have guessing. We have.

01:57:42
<transcript>: Checking answer.

01:57:46
<transcript>: And we have so this one has a choice.

01:57:52
<transcript>: We have.

01:57:54
<transcript>: Oh.

01:58:12
<transcript>: We have.

01:58:16
<transcript>: Oh no.

01:58:21
<transcript>: You have active and showing answer.

01:58:24
<transcript>: This one has a result.

01:58:27
<transcript>: Okay.

01:58:32
<transcript>: Not all of them. Then there's game over state. I don't know. Don't do anything with that right now.

01:58:35
<transcript>: I don't I don't care right now.

01:58:35
<transcript>: i guess

01:58:38
<transcript>: I guess I should model them all.

01:58:42
<transcript>: Value game over.

01:58:45
<transcript>: All of them I think that's all of them.

01:58:48
<transcript>: Okay. So now we have games.

01:58:48
<transcript>: state

01:58:49
<transcript>: State.

01:58:54
<transcript>: Name type States.

01:58:58
<transcript>: Does this fix all of our TypeScript issues? Maybe.

01:59:05
<transcript>: What.

01:59:05
<transcript>: broke

01:59:08
<transcript>: Broke everything live.

01:59:11
<transcript>: Game state.

01:59:11
<transcript>: no game type

01:59:14
<transcript>: No game type state does not satisfy the constraint.

01:59:14
<transcript>: type state

01:59:17
<transcript>: Type state context. What.

01:59:24
<transcript>: Oh, each of them has to have a context on it, I guess.

01:59:26
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

01:59:29
<transcript>: Context is just context.

01:59:36
<transcript>: Context, context.

01:59:44
<transcript>: So this is now.

01:59:44
<transcript>: is it time

01:59:47
<transcript>: Is it time save? Or is it just being annoying.

01:59:57
<transcript>: Current state value never.

02:00:07
<transcript>: Matches. Can you give it to me? Oh, look at this.

02:00:09
<transcript>: Active.

02:00:09
<transcript>: current match

02:00:12
<transcript>: Current matches active. What was this one.

02:00:22
<transcript>: It was guessing. So active. Dot guessing. Is it not gonna give me that though? Matches types. Does it give me the type safety there.

02:00:24
<transcript>: Oh, does it not.

02:00:32
<transcript>: How am I supposed to how am I supposed to do it, then.

02:00:40
<transcript>: Is it? Oh, is it like matches.

02:00:43
<transcript>: Value of.

02:00:48
<transcript>: Is that how it works? I don't know.

02:00:51
<transcript>: That's not how it works.

02:00:56
<transcript>: Oh, this one. We got this working. Then we added type safety, and it broke it.

02:01:01
<transcript>: Well, there's two overloads.

02:01:04
<transcript>: There's two overloads.

02:01:11
<transcript>: Let's see overload one of two.

02:01:19
<transcript>: And then overload two of two idol starting active or active guessing. Okay, so we have to do we can't do the dot notation anymore. That's okay.

02:01:19
<transcript>: that's fine

02:01:21
<transcript>: That's fine. We just have to do.

02:01:21
<transcript>: we have

02:01:24
<transcript>: We have to do like this.

02:01:24
<transcript>: active

02:01:26
<transcript>: Active.

02:01:29
<transcript>: Guessing is it not gonna give me type ahead on that though.

02:01:30
<transcript>: A bunch.

02:01:35
<transcript>: That one was.

02:01:40
<transcript>: I just do the wrong one. No, that's right.

02:01:45
<transcript>: And then same here.

02:01:49
<transcript>: Active.

02:01:51
<transcript>: Guessing.

02:01:56
<transcript>: And down here, same thing.

02:02:00
<transcript>: It's gonna be.

02:02:00
<transcript>: checking

02:02:01
<transcript>: Checking.

02:02:01
<transcript>: answer

02:02:02
<transcript>: Answer.

02:02:07
<transcript>: And this one is going to be active.
