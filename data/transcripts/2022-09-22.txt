00:11:34
<transcript>: The two days a week thing. I said I was gonna stream yesterday and then I didn't. I'm sorry. I never said I wasn't going to. I just kind of didn't.

00:11:36
<transcript>: Things with the follow attitory.

00:11:36
<transcript>: four minutes

00:11:40
<transcript>: Four minutes ago during the intro, the intro did it for you.

00:11:43
<transcript>: You knew you wanted to come back after that.

00:11:48
<transcript>: Yen's is here. Bear Dev is here.

00:11:52
<transcript>: Hello, Everyone. Good afternoon. Good. Whatever.

00:11:59

<transcript>: Catarina, mom, emote. Mommy. Okay, okay.

00:12:20
<transcript>: no one's called

00:12:24
<transcript>: No one's called me Mommy. Yet that's a Twitch chat first.

00:12:25
<transcript>: But.

00:12:27
godbless_27: hello

00:12:28
<transcript>: Works for me.

00:12:28
<transcript>: how's everybody doing

00:12:31
<transcript>: How's everybody doing? Twitch is dying. Did you hear.

00:12:33
<transcript>: Hello, God bless.

00:12:36
fudaaa1: popped the cherry

00:12:41
<transcript>: You as unclear to me if Twitch is already dead, or if it's dying.

00:12:41
<transcript>: but

00:12:43
<transcript>: But.

00:12:43
<transcript>: we're on the way out

00:12:44
<transcript>: We're on the way out.

00:12:44
<transcript>: these may be the last

00:12:48
<transcript>: These may be the last few streams before it's completely dead.

00:12:48
<transcript>: that's what i understand

00:12:49
<transcript>: That's what I understand.

00:13:05
<transcript>: I don't understand. Here's what I don't understand. That's Twitch thing. I don't understand. I guess for those of you, everyone heard of me. If you're on Twitch, I just assume you've heard about the blog post where they're paying some creators less. Now.

00:13:05
<transcript>: and

00:13:07
<transcript>: And they talked about.

00:13:07
<transcript>: their infrastructure

00:13:12
<transcript>: Their infrastructure costs and all this stuff. The thing I don't understand about the whole Twitch thing.

00:13:12
<transcript>: is why

00:13:15
<transcript>: Is Why Amazon Cares about money.

00:13:17
stiefbroerikzitvast: multimillionaires are getting paid a bit less DL

00:13:18
<transcript>: Isn't. I mean, Amazon is like.

00:13:22
<transcript>: Huge, right? Isn't it? Like.

00:13:31
<transcript>: Just like worth being culturally relevant to own Twitch. And does it matter if Twitch makes money honestly? Does it.

00:13:40
<transcript>: This prime video. Does their whole studio arm make money? I assume. No, I assume they just. That's just a vanity thing that Bezos wants to just pump.

00:13:40
<transcript>: bill

00:13:43
stiefbroerikzitvast: it shouldnt loose them too much

00:13:43
jenswoeste: middle management need to reach their kpi's to get corp bonus.

00:13:49
<transcript>: Billions into a studio because he wants to, like, hang out with movie stars and have original content that their company makes. I don't know. Why doesn't Twitch. Why doesn't Twitch the same thing.

00:13:49
<transcript>: all they just pour

00:13:54
<transcript>: All. They just pour money into it. And who cares if it makes money? They need to beat Google. It stuff.

00:13:54
<transcript>: isn't

00:14:06
<transcript>: Isn't it all just like Amazon and Google and Facebook, and whoever just trying to be the most relevant big company. I just thought they poured money in this stuff like this. Now they don't care that it makes money. It just like, sounds like.

00:14:06
<transcript>: we're pinny pinching

00:14:10
<transcript>: We're pinny pinching at Twitch. And why, who cares.

00:14:10
<transcript>: i don't know

00:14:13
<transcript>: I don't know that's my I know nothing pic.

00:14:13
<transcript>: never

00:14:19
<transcript>: Never been a big company executive. I've never worked at a big company, so I literally know nothing.

00:14:24
<transcript>: Millionaires Multimillionaire is getting paid a bit less. Yeah.

00:14:24
<transcript>: shouldn't lose

00:14:29
<transcript>: Shouldn't lose them too much. I wouldn't think so. I wouldn't think Twitch is like a big.

00:14:29
<transcript>: line item

00:14:35
<transcript>: Line item on the Amazon balance sheet. Middle management needed to reach their KPIs.

00:14:35
<transcript>: now that

00:14:38
<transcript>: Now that could be it yen's.

00:14:46
<transcript>: That could be it. I think big companies, incentives are funny. Like when you think about the people who actually work at big companies.

00:14:46
<transcript>: they

00:14:49
<transcript>: They have personal incentives that.

00:14:49
<transcript>: i don't know

00:14:50
<transcript>: I don't know.

00:14:53
<transcript>: May not be clear to us.

00:14:53
<transcript>: and that's

00:14:56
<transcript>: And that's a good call could be that.

00:15:00
<transcript>: Although I guess the blog post was by somebody big, wasn't it.

00:15:02
corfliss: Hello there, what are we discussing now?

00:15:04
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the sub. Renee. I appreciate that.

00:15:08
<transcript>: Welcome to the subscriber.

00:15:08
<transcript>: i don't know

00:15:13
<transcript>: I don't know welcome to being subscribed to me it's still early.

00:15:13
<transcript>: i'm still waking

00:15:19
<transcript>: I'm still waking up. Hello, there. What are we discussing now? Corps list. Corpus is here. We are discussing.

00:15:19
<transcript>: the twitch

00:15:20
<transcript>: The Twitch.

00:15:20
<transcript>: blog post

00:15:23
<transcript>: Blog posts that's getting much attention.

00:15:26
<transcript>: There's a lot of a lot of blowback.

00:15:29
<transcript>: From people that it didn't affect.

00:15:34
corfliss: Ah yes, that one.

00:15:45
<transcript>: Didn't affect me. I don't care. No, that's not the right way to view it, I guess. But there is some sentiment that Twitch is lost touch with creators. And my thing is just I just kind of went over it. I just don't get white. Amazon cares. Like, isn't Amazon involved? Like surely.

00:15:48
jenswoeste: be honest - you were planning to get the 30/70 split

00:15:52
<transcript>: They're calling Shot at Twitch now, right? Did they, like, bring in their people to run Twitch? Or did they not? I have no idea.

00:15:52
<transcript>: i was plan

00:16:02
<transcript>: I was planning to get the 37. Honestly, Yen's, I have no idea who gets it. I thought it was just like I heard it was just a very small percentages of creators that got that.

00:16:02
<transcript>: like

00:16:10
<transcript>: Like I exaggerated and said there was ten, but it's not very many, right? It's just like the mega people who have, like, special deals or something.

00:16:10
<transcript>: i really don't

00:16:18
<transcript>: I really don't know enough about the economics on Twitch. I've never once, as a programmer deciding I'm gonna stream thought that money would be a thing.

00:16:21
<transcript>: That I would make money from Twitch.

00:16:23
jenswoeste: I think those who made partner a long time ago

00:16:24
<transcript>: I guess.

00:16:39
<transcript>: The thing I'm not clear on is like, how much does Amazon run Twitch? Because when they buy companies don't they just sort of like, take over. They're one of those acquires that kind of like makes it work for Amazon, like Whole foods.

00:16:39
<transcript>: is very clear

00:16:57
<transcript>: Is very clearly an Amazon company now, like when you walk in Whole Foods, if anyone shops at Whole Foods, I don't know. Maybe that's just me, but it's like there's Amazon deliveries being made at Whole Foods. You can, like, get a locker that says Amazon on it like, there's just Amazon Stuff everywhere. Your prime subscription. You can open the Amazon app and get a discount.

00:16:57
<transcript>: these are

00:17:06
<transcript>: These are very like Amazon's in Charge, you know. So is it like that at Twitch or is it not they just let Twitch keep doing Twitch things.

00:17:06
<transcript>: thanks so much

00:17:10
<transcript>: Thanks so much for the follow. Maddie, I appreciate the follow.

00:17:16
<transcript>: A long time ago.

00:17:16
<transcript>: do you

00:17:21
<transcript>: Do you have any sense? How many people? How many people actually are affected.

00:17:31
jenswoeste: no idea

00:17:35
<transcript>: I tried to read the blog post again. I didn't see like a number. I think it said 90% of something. 90% of somebody won't be affected. I just didn't know who knows. Somebody's were. No idea. Okay.

00:17:44
<transcript>: Well, that's enough about Twitch. Except the part where we're on Twitch. I guess it's gonna still be about Twitch in that sense.

00:17:44
<transcript>: but we're gonna build

00:17:49
<transcript>: But we're gonna build stuff. Aw, guess I've got a Twitch. My left eye is twitching.

00:17:49
<transcript>: i

00:17:51
<transcript>: I don't know why.

00:17:51
<transcript>: you might see

00:17:53
<transcript>: You might see it on stream.

00:18:02
<transcript>: Maybe when I get particularly stressed or bothered by a problem might just start twitching like I'm trying to navigate in vim.

00:18:04
<transcript>: And just starts.

00:18:08
corfliss: My internet is disconnecting every half an hour. LUL

00:18:10
<transcript>: I can't make it happen every time I was trying to watch it happen in the mirror last night because it just started happening yesterday.

00:18:10
<transcript>: and every time

00:18:17
<transcript>: And every time I look like I would look away and it would start happening. I look in the mirror and it just stops. I don't know what that's about.

00:18:23
<transcript>: Your internet is disconnect me every half hour. That would give me anxiety. That would be my Twitch for sure.

00:18:32
<transcript>: That's funny. We were just talking about Twitch. And then I started up my I Twitch. Like the two things we've talked about so far we're twitching.

00:18:34
<transcript>: Twitch.

00:18:34
<transcript>: in different

00:18:36
<transcript>: In different forms.

00:18:36
<transcript>: okay

00:18:39
<transcript>: Okay new thing I want to build.

00:18:43
<transcript>: Which I shouldn't because I need to focus on making stuff.

00:18:43
<transcript>: i mean making

00:18:46
<transcript>: I mean making like YouTube stuff.

00:18:46
<transcript>: but

00:18:50
<transcript>: But new thing I want to build. I'm definitely gonna build it. I'm gonna build it right here on Twitch.

00:18:57
<transcript>: I need a name. So Cuba is named AW. Guess QB is around. And what's the name? Another thing.

00:18:57
<transcript>: but

00:19:03
<transcript>: But I'm gonna make a CLI tool. I've kind of done this before. Made a CLI tool for AWS, things.

00:19:11
<transcript>: But this is gonna be a tool specifically to help you just stand up your AWS account. So I think there's a lot of web developers.

00:19:17
<transcript>: That they have this idea of. Aws, it's just very, like, difficult.

00:19:17
<transcript>: and cumbersome

00:19:26
<transcript>: And cumbersome thing to work with and I get it in some senses it is, but most of their pain, I think, is just in the initial, like setting up a good.

00:19:33
<transcript>: Aws account setting up good ergonomics with your development machine once you have it all set up.

00:19:33
<transcript>: a tobs

00:19:39
<transcript>: A Tobs is kind of like just writing apps. I mean, if you're using something like SST or architect.

00:19:39
<transcript>: it's

00:19:44
<transcript>: It's pretty fun, and I don't think there's any reason why.

00:19:44
<transcript>: what

00:19:47
<transcript>: What does More Web shouldn't add it to their toolbar.

00:19:47
<transcript>: i think

00:19:55
<transcript>: I think they just get overwhelmed with, like, creating the account setting a billing, worrying about what's gonna happen. Are they gonna have a huge bill that's surprised.

00:19:55
<transcript>: so

00:19:58
<transcript>: So like having a CLI tool, that sort of.

00:19:58
<transcript>: stands

00:20:03
<transcript>: Stands up. A simple account structure, like a Dev and a product account or something.

00:20:03
<transcript>: sets up

00:20:09
<transcript>: Sets up SSO so that you don't have like keys sitting on your machine you could leak.

00:20:09
<transcript>: there's just a lot of things

00:20:11
<transcript>: There's just a lot of things that have improved on the.

00:20:11
<transcript>: terms of best

00:20:16
<transcript>: Terms of best practices with security and things that make it easier to work with.

00:20:16
<transcript>: but

00:20:23
<transcript>: But there's like a gap. Still there's like an education cap. So I think a single client tool where you're like MPX.

00:20:26
<transcript>: Something AWS something.

00:20:29
<transcript>: And it just like, creates all your accounts.

00:20:29
<transcript>: and

00:20:31
<transcript>: And does all the stuff.

00:20:31
<transcript>: it could

00:20:34
<transcript>: It could set up SCPs.

00:20:34
<transcript>: in your organization

00:20:39
<transcript>: In your organizational unit to make sure you don't run like EC Two and stuff like that. That can be expensive.

00:20:43
<transcript>: There's just a lot we could do. Setup, building alarms, all that stuff all through the API.

00:20:43
<transcript>: so

00:20:45
<transcript>: So we're gonna build it.

00:20:47
<transcript>: Not today.

00:20:54
<transcript>: But we're gonna build it's, gonna help in, like, a lot of the things I want to teach.

00:20:54
<transcript>: in terms of

00:20:58
<transcript>: In terms of this new career, I'm trying to create where I teach.

00:21:08
<transcript>: It's gonna help lower the barrier to entry for people coming from modern webdev. They're used to verselle and that Dev experience. It's just easy.

00:21:08
<transcript>: i want to

00:21:16
<transcript>: I want to try and help bridge that gap where people aren't scared to spin up stuff in the Navy. It'd have been account like creating APIs and things like that.

00:21:16
<transcript>: there's just a lot more

00:21:19
<transcript>: There's just a lot more tools once you have all of a Tobis at your disposal.

00:21:25
<transcript>: Yeah. It's nice. Okay. Enough about that. Let's actually do stuff.

00:21:28
<transcript>: I don't have much to say today.

00:21:31
<transcript>: I've said too much already.

00:21:34
<transcript>: What did I just do.

00:21:34
<transcript>: i just stopped

00:21:35
offbyjohn: Rust CLI? ;)

00:21:36
<transcript>: I just stopped recording because.

00:21:45
<transcript>: My Why is my stream deck the worst.

00:21:52
<transcript>: Why does it do this? It switches back and forth. See, I was ready to go to my intro this morning.

00:21:52
<transcript>: i was ready

00:21:53
<transcript>: I was ready.

00:21:53
<transcript>: and

00:21:59
<transcript>: And my stream deck just switches back to a different profile. I'm just gonna have to delete the other profile, alright.

00:21:59
<transcript>: now we're coming

00:22:04
<transcript>: Now we're coming back. Rust CLI. You know what off by John. Welcome to Chat. First of all.

00:22:04
<transcript>: second

00:22:06
<transcript>: Second of all.

00:22:06
<transcript>: i had that thought

00:22:13
<transcript>: I had that thought. I thought I told myself, next time I build a CLI, I'm gonna build it with something other than node.

00:22:26
<transcript>: The problem is it's gonna be open source and I just don't know if I build it, if I learn rest and build this thing and rest. I mean all it is is like some API calls, right.

00:22:28
<transcript>: After glasses on my face what is going on.

00:22:31
<transcript>: It's not switching the camera.

00:22:31
<transcript>: what is the

00:22:33
<transcript>: What is the deal.

00:22:38
laytanl_: Hello!

00:22:41
<transcript>: This is frustrating. Hang on, where is it? Where's my camera thing.

00:22:47
<transcript>: So this camera is not the right camera or something.

00:22:50
<transcript>: That's not the right one.

00:22:50
<transcript>: there it is

00:22:51
<transcript>: There it is.

00:22:54
<transcript>: Geez.

00:22:57
<transcript>: It's amateur hour.

00:23:00
<transcript>: On Twitch. Okay.

00:23:00
<transcript>: there i am

00:23:05
<transcript>: There I am looking at the right camera. Hey, Leighton, now that you're here, maybe things will be better.

00:23:10
<transcript>: Maybe things will be better. Frags here. Okay. I can feel things. Or looking up.

00:23:10
<transcript>: things

00:23:15
<transcript>: Things are starting to improve around here. We had a little rough start.

00:23:15
<transcript>: with

00:23:20
<transcript>: With my stupid stream deck, which I'm getting upset with switching profiles on me.

00:23:22
<transcript>: Okay.

00:23:27
<transcript>: So the question I guess off by John is Do I.

00:23:27
<transcript>: oh frag

00:23:30
<transcript>: Oh, Frag, that was a sub. Thank you so much for the resub.

00:23:30
<transcript>: i just saw

00:23:36
<transcript>: I just saw that. I just thought you sent a message, but it was actually a message in a sub.

00:23:39
<transcript>: Three months? Oh.

00:23:39
<transcript>: frag

00:23:47
<transcript>: Frag has a three month badge. Well, maybe he doesn't. It doesn't have a three month badge because he has all these other badges.

00:23:52
<transcript>: Like a Founder badge and a Moderator badge and a gifter leader.

00:23:54
corfliss: It's Subtember. So ye

00:23:55
<transcript>: Three month street though Wow.

00:23:55
<transcript>: that's

00:23:55
fragaverage: Not a collector 👀

00:23:59
fudaaa1: thoughts on salesforce?

00:24:00
<transcript>: That's I didn't even. It's hard to believe I've been on here for three months. Actually. That's crazy.

00:24:09
<transcript>: Yeah, okay. Back to off by John if I ride it in rest, I worry that it'll be less approachable from an open source standpoint.

00:24:09
<transcript>: like

00:24:16
<transcript>: Like fewer people to contribute fewer people to learn something from it. The code is gonna be Super.

00:24:16
<transcript>: stupid

00:24:24
<transcript>: Stupid, simple. It's just gonna be making a bunch of AWS SDK calls, so in that sense, it'd be a great project to learn. Rest with because there's not much to it.

00:24:31
<transcript>: Not a collector, what's a collector.

00:24:31
<transcript>: not on the

00:24:36
<transcript>: Not on the Salesforce. What happened to Salesforce? First of all, what is Salesforce? I've heard of it.

00:24:42
tafiir: isn't the rust opensource community pretty big?

00:24:44
<transcript>: Those who don't remember.

00:24:44
<transcript>: we are building

00:24:44
fragaverage: badge collector* lol

00:24:45
<transcript>: We are building.

00:24:45
<transcript>: aw

00:24:48
<transcript>: Aw guess or for those who are new.

00:24:54
<transcript>: The guess is a game where you get your shown in the service tile there's like 300 of them.

00:24:54
<transcript>: and

00:24:55
<transcript>: And.

00:24:55
<transcript>: you

00:24:59
<transcript>: You have to guess which service it is.

00:25:06
<transcript>: Some I'm easy, because it'll be like the logo will say FSX, and then like one of the options will be at the six. That's nice.

00:25:06
<transcript>: a badge

00:25:08
<transcript>: A badge collector. I got you.

00:25:17
<transcript>: Yeah test. I think the rest open source community is pretty big. I guess the question is the Vin diagram between.

00:25:20
<transcript>: The Rest open source community.

00:25:20
<transcript>: and

00:25:23
<transcript>: And the people who will see this repo.

00:25:23
<transcript>: which is

00:25:26
<transcript>: Which is like, I guess AWS, people.

00:25:34
<transcript>: Maybe I shouldn't worry about it. Maybe I should just write what I want to write, and I really do want to learn. Rest. This will be kind of a perfect project.

00:25:34
<transcript>: to learn

00:25:37
<transcript>: To learn rest, because it's just it's really simple.

00:25:47
<transcript>: Yeah. Maybe. Maybe rest. It'd be fun. Be fun to learn something new. We're not learning enough new things right now. Like them and team.

00:25:51
<transcript>: All the other things I'm trying to learn.

00:25:57

00:26:12
fudaaa1: its a CRM

00:26:14
<transcript>: There's a bit of a rough start, but I'm not gonna have a bad stream. I refuse it's gonna be a great stream.

00:26:22
<transcript>: Because I don't get enough of them. There's too few streams to have bad streams. It's gonna be a good one we're gonna build. Aw, guess.

00:26:37
<transcript>: How excited I don't have to break necessarily at the same time I normally do today. I couldn't make the stream a little bit longer. We'll see depends on who's streaming it. So there's like somebody streaming. I wanna see him. Before the end of my day. We'll probably rate him, but we'll see.

00:26:39
beardotdev: streaming at 6AM. there is another morning person

00:26:40
mir0dev: seems to be great content => dropping follow

00:26:47

00:27:21
<transcript>: But I appreciate that a whole lot. We had some struggles. It's been tough. The stream deck has been tough.

00:27:21
<transcript>: my

00:27:22
andom: Howdy HeyGuys

00:27:25
<transcript>: My camera software also tough.

00:27:25
<transcript>: it's been

00:27:30
corfliss: Howdy, Andom.

00:27:34
<transcript>: It's been tough. And I'm here. Okay? I gotta stop saying the same words. Twitch. Tough. Rust. I keep saying words like multiple meanings of them.

00:27:40
mir0dev: just found u out, trusting my guts feeling :))

00:27:41
<transcript>: Okay. So let's just get back to it. Let's just start building. Maybe that'll make things feel better.

00:27:43
danielgerep: What's the Rick Roll challenge/reward?

00:27:46
<transcript>: Sound on all the emotions of the morning.

00:28:10
<transcript>: You nailed it. I literally started, like, type. For the first time, I was gonna, like, start doing something. And then here we are.

00:28:27

00:28:32
<transcript>: Dead robots here.

00:28:39
<transcript>: What is Nixer? What do you mean, streaming on mixer.

00:28:42
beardotdev: streaming platform

uberrick: Haha nah mixer was a streaming platform that died

00:28:57
<transcript>: This is the Rick Roll challenge. It just closes all my.

00:29:00
<transcript>: Opens this up.

00:29:01
stroopwafel26: Mixer was a streaming platform owned by Microsoft

00:29:03
<transcript>: Mixer was a streaming platform that died. Okay.

00:29:07
<transcript>: I hope Twitter. I hope Twitch doesn't die. I hope it's around this day.

00:29:27
<transcript>: I think it's probably just one of those things where people get really upset just to be upset, like, every time Facebook would change its layout and there'd be like a million people be like, I hate the new layout I'm done with Facebook, and then they get back on there and keep talking about dumb stuff like politics. I hate Facebook. I have like, a lot of, like, social media grudges.

00:29:27
<transcript>: like i basically

00:29:30
<transcript>: Like, I basically hate all these companies.

00:29:30
<transcript>: in

00:29:32
<transcript>: In different ways, but I hate them all.

00:29:32
<transcript>: really need

00:29:34
<transcript>: Really need to let go of it.

00:29:34
<transcript>: like

00:29:36
<transcript>: Like.

00:29:36
<transcript>: there's nothing i

00:29:40
<transcript>: There's nothing I can do my hatred doesn't make them.

00:29:49
<transcript>: Suck any less, so I should just get over it. Oh, here we go. The timer's working. What is it? It's time stream. Look at that. See, this is how this game works.

00:29:49
<transcript>: it's a lot fun

00:29:50
<transcript>: It's a lot fun.

00:29:50
<transcript>: that's

00:29:53
<transcript>: That's definitely cloud front. I actually knew that one.

00:29:57
<transcript>: That looks like a robot.

00:29:59
<transcript>: I'm not sure.

00:30:04
beardotdev: VPC ?

00:30:06
stroopwafel26: facebook is only used by boomers now, right?

00:30:06
beardotdev: lol

00:30:08
<transcript>: For Opendoor Elemental Data. Oh, got it, Delta. I didn't even know what it was. Oh, I know this one. This is Quick site.

00:30:15
<transcript>: I know some of them. I even have some of them all. The most famous of all icons. We all know it. We all love it. It's Lambda.

00:30:15
<transcript>: i even had

00:30:19
<transcript>: I even had some of these printed on my wall. So I'm such a nerd.

00:30:19
beardotdev: half life ?

00:30:24
mir0dev: its half life lol

00:30:32
<transcript>: Is that ECS? Okay, I don't use containers, so I'm forgiven. Oh, we just did this one, didn't we? Is this different than the one we just did.

00:30:32
corfliss: Half life 3 confirmed

00:30:36
<transcript>: Elemental Appliances and software.

00:30:40
<transcript>: That's ECS anywhere right.

00:30:40
<transcript>: i gotta work on

00:30:43
<transcript>: I gotta work on the capitalization of the sort of they're not right.

00:30:55
<transcript>: What's this look like? Outputs. Probably. Yeah. Okay. We're gonna work on scoring because right now this is pretty unfulfilling. When you get like a bunch in a row and then you don't have a score.

00:30:57
laytanl_: Are you still making this multiplayer?

00:30:57
<transcript>: What is this code? I.

00:30:57
<transcript>: know

00:30:59
<transcript>: Know. What is this.

00:30:59
<transcript>: oh

00:31:01
<transcript>: Oh, it's gonna be too late.

00:31:06
<transcript>: All right, that's enough. Playing.

00:31:09
<transcript>: What a one last one here.

00:31:20
<transcript>: Okay. I didn't actually know that one. I just guessed. Well, that one's got to be music. I feel like I should guess it deep composer. Okay, now we're done, we're done, we're done.

00:31:20
<transcript>: let's

00:31:28
<transcript>: Let's stop. I'm just gonna watch that timer go. I guess we need to have something like when the timer goes to the end, it needs to turn red.

00:31:28
<transcript>: and

00:31:30
<transcript>: And like.

00:31:30
<transcript>: you know

00:31:39
<transcript>: You know it needs to do something to let you know you didn't get it and then move to Backslin because we're not doing that right now late. And yes, we're gonna make it multiplayer for sure.

00:31:42
<transcript>: We just we haven't gotten there yet.

00:31:47
<transcript>: Mixer was owned by Microsoft.

00:31:48
<transcript>: Interesting.

00:31:48
<transcript>: oh you

00:31:55
<transcript>: Oh, you guys are trying to help me. Guess Facebook has only used by Boomers now, right? I think so. I don't know anyone here.

00:31:55
<transcript>: i'm sure there

00:31:57
<transcript>: I'm sure there's no.

00:32:06
<transcript>: Overlap. There's probably no Vin diagram where there's a middle piece that's Twitch and Facebook users. But does anyone here you say, don't be ashamed. It's okay.

00:32:08
<transcript>: I won't judge you.

00:32:08
<transcript>: i use twitter

00:32:11
<transcript>: I use Twitter. Like, Who Am I to judge.

00:32:11
<transcript>: does anyone on

00:32:16
<transcript>: Does anyone on here use Facebook? Maybe you use it to, like, stay in touch with your parents.

00:32:18
<transcript>: Or your grandparents.

00:32:18
corfliss: I deleted my FB.

00:32:20
corfliss: So ye

00:32:21
<transcript>: Maybe anybody.

00:32:21
<transcript>: deleted your face

00:32:25
<transcript>: Deleted your Facebook. Yeah. A lot of people have.

00:32:27
beardotdev: me !

00:32:29
<transcript>: It's funny how the social platforms kind of like.

00:32:32
deadrobotdev: I deactivated FB, but kept Messenger to keep in touch with people who use it

00:32:35
<transcript>: Oh, you Bear, not Dev uses it. Use Facebook. What do you use it for? Bear.

00:32:39
offbyjohn: I use MySpace only

00:32:41
kociqq: messenger only yeah

00:32:45
<transcript>: Deactivate a Facebook would cut messengers. So that's another thing. A lot of people use messenger, which is a Facebook property. And then a lot of people who believe their Facebook still use Instagram. So.

00:32:45
<transcript>: it's like

00:32:51
<transcript>: It's like Meta's gonna get you somehow they're gonna get you. They've got your data.

00:32:51
<transcript>: messenger

00:32:54
<transcript>: Messenger only? Yeah, okay. Myspace Only Off by John.

00:32:54
<transcript>: is my

00:32:56
mir0dev: i use fb to remind myself how dumb the people from my country are

00:33:01
stroopwafel26: My wife thinks I'm insane for using Twitter even, she thinks it's a cesspool and I can't argue with that MaxLOL

00:33:01
<transcript>: Is my face still in existence? I know Tom is like the coolest person ever, and he's just hanging out. But does my face still exist.

00:33:12
<transcript>: Okay. I have to be honest. Mirror. I do, too. I use Facebook. I hop on Facebook about once every couple weeks.

00:33:17
beardotdev: i use it when i'm bored. its mostly sport news/memes

00:33:18
<transcript>: For some reason, it's very entertaining to watch the people that you grew up with.

00:33:18
<transcript>: say things

00:33:20
<transcript>: Say things that are just.

00:33:21
beardotdev: i use twitter too

00:33:35
<transcript>: They just hurt your brain. Something about that's entertaining. And I don't know if that's why Facebook still has a millennial footprint. I mostly get on Facebook just to read the stuff that really bothers me. It really it's like stuff that like, how could you think that way.

00:33:43
beardotdev: and i like to read boomers comments Kappa

00:33:51
<transcript>: And it's funny because like it doesn't even matter. I'm not gonna say how I think it doesn't even matter. However you think it's very bothersome to see the way other people think and for some reason that's entertainment. I don't know. I don't get it. I don't get it.

00:33:56
<transcript>: My wife thinks I'm insane for using Twitter.

00:34:03
<transcript>: It's really true. I don't know why I saw you. Twitter. I hate Twitter. There's a lot of things about Twitter that bother me.

00:34:15
<transcript>: He's on a board, mostly sport, news and memes. Yeah. My wife uses Facebook for the groups that she follows. So a lot of, like news and things she gets from Facebook.

00:34:18
offbyjohn: You mean there isn't an ice wall around the earth to keep the water from falling off the edge?

00:34:19
<transcript>: Use Twitter to like to read Boomers comments.

00:34:25
<transcript>: We're not ages here. I'm pretty old so I will not make any like but.

00:34:25
<transcript>: it's just it's the

00:34:35
<transcript>: It's just it's the baby members like, that is their generation, right? You can just say Boomers, and that's not necessarily negative. I know a lot of people use it in a negative. And like a negative. Connotation.

00:34:35
<transcript>: but

00:34:35
stroopwafel26: What do you mean 5G doesn't cause covid?

00:34:36
<transcript>: But.

00:34:36
<transcript>: if

00:34:43
<transcript>: If you're a baby Boomer, it's okay. We're all part of bad generations? All of our generations are bad? They're all bad.

00:34:45
<transcript>: And it doesn't mean you're bad.

00:34:52
<transcript>: You mean there isn't an ice wall around the Earth to keep the water from falling off the edge.

00:34:57
<transcript>: The slider, stuff. That's funny.

00:34:57
<transcript>: what do you mean five

00:34:59
kociqq: I mean, facebook is not bad. Only bad thing about facebook is that it is not good Kappa

00:35:00
<transcript>: What do you mean, 5G doesn't cut. Okay, now we're just.

00:35:00
<transcript>: we're hitting

00:35:09
<transcript>: We're hitting. We're listing them off. All the crazy. The crazy stuff. There's a lot of stuff out there. People believe it's kind of wild these days.

00:35:14
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't know. Like, when does that get better? When are we gonna figure out how to, like.

00:35:15
corfliss: You know, FAANG is not exists anymore.

00:35:20
stroopwafel26: Michael Jackson is still alive, I read it on facebook

00:35:23
corfliss: It's MANGA, because Facebook is Meta now.

00:35:25
<transcript>: I don't know, like half facts. Again. There's no facts anymore. Just like that's your opinion? No, that's actually the fact. It's a proven fact. Here's the evidence know that's your opinion.

00:35:25
<transcript>: i've had doing

00:35:27
<transcript>: I've had doing the conversations on the Internet, clearly.

00:35:31
<transcript>: Michael Jackson is still alive. Oh, really.

00:35:31
<transcript>: well that'd be

00:35:34
<transcript>: Well, that'd be great. Actually. I wish he was.

00:35:38
<transcript>: Facebook is not bad. Only bad thing about Facebook is that it's not good.

00:35:45
<transcript>: I love how your name glows? Like golden cozy. I feel like I'm in the presence of royalty.

00:35:45
<transcript>: what do i

<transcript>: What do I have to do to get to get the golden name.

00:35:49
<transcript>: a seven t

00:35:51
<transcript>: A Seven TV subscriber.

00:35:51
<transcript>: so if i'm a

00:35:52
onepunchmac: What language are you using

00:35:59
<transcript>: So if I'm a Seven TV subscriber, I get a badge for it. You don't get badges for just any subscription. Do they have some special deal with Twitter.

00:36:05
<transcript>: To Adam Dev. You don't get a badge for it, right? That you can use on other channels.

00:36:07
kociqq: it's extension

00:36:12
mir0dev: "MANGA developer"

00:36:12
<transcript>: One Panch, Mac, one punch, Mac. Welcome to Chat. I'm using this is TypeScript.

00:36:14
stroopwafel26: @OnePunchMac English

00:36:24
<transcript>: This right here is TypeScript. And let's actually write some code. I just. I keep talking. I keep saying things about things I know nothing about. I should stop. I know nothing. Don't take anything I say seriously.

00:36:33
onepunchmac: Ah ok no problem

00:36:33
<transcript>: Except for the code stuff. And even then you should probably Google it check stack over what? Make sure I'm I'm not wrong. I probably am.

00:36:41
<transcript>: Okay, we've got our mutations, new game, new round and answer.

00:36:48
<transcript>: So the timing thing. Let's do let's do the timing thing. So when the let's see.

00:37:08
<transcript>: Here's somewhere. This. This effect right here we have. This is where our elapse time. I finally figured this out. I just. I spent five minutes after stream the other day, and I figured out what I was doing wrong. I actually didn't figure that. I just. I kept changing stuff until it worked. I don't remember why it wasn't working. For one thing, we had to cap it at 100.

00:37:09
onepunchmac: stroopwafel26 cohhHmm

00:37:12
<transcript>: But I don't really know I don't remember what I had to change.

00:37:19
<transcript>: So. Okay, so this hammer works, but we want it to turn red.

00:37:19
<transcript>: when

00:37:23
<transcript>: When it's ended so when it hits a hundred.

00:37:23
<transcript>: let's see

00:37:25
<transcript>: Let's see.

<transcript>: Aw guess is a guessing game where you're presenting with an AWS service and you have to guess what it is or just know the answer. That's an option as well. You don't have to guess.

00:39:20
raticide: aws wordle?

00:39:22
<transcript>: So we're gonna do this. We're gonna say why I'm gonna do it again. Y s a quote.

00:39:22
<transcript>: this time it's gonna

00:39:26
<transcript>: This time it's gonna be paren's, Ysa quote.

00:39:26
<transcript>: parenz

00:39:28
stroopwafel26: What do you use to trigger the confetti? my computer needs more confetti

00:39:29
<transcript>: Parenz, look at that. And we're gonna set.

00:39:37
<transcript>: One more time. Y s a quote. I say quote. Bracket. Okay.

00:39:45
<transcript>: True. Okay. All that to do this.

00:39:48
cedpoilly: hello all

00:39:51
<transcript>: Let's see. I want to yank that to space now. Didn't work.

00:39:51
<transcript>: how do i want

00:39:54
<transcript>: How do I want to do that? I just want to, like.

00:39:56
corfliss: Is it just me or everytime I see confetti on video the bitrate becomes worse?

00:39:58
<transcript>: Oh, here we go? I could Yank To quote.

00:40:00
cedpoilly: hello @adamdotdev brought some friends to the party

00:40:03
corfliss: @cedpoilly Hello there.

00:40:07
<transcript>: Yank to quote, Does that work? I feel like I don't understand how to yank with movements. Like with motions.

00:40:11
<transcript>: Hello, Roth and friends of the party. Welcome, everybody.

00:40:11
<transcript>: it's

00:40:13
<transcript>: It's.

00:40:13
<transcript>: early

00:40:18
<transcript>: Early. I'm still still shaking off the rest. I've been streaming, less.

00:40:23
<transcript>: But you coming. That helps. I'm feeling a little better already.

00:40:29
<transcript>: They're just me. Every time I say confetti on a video, the bitrate becomes worse. Yeah, it probably does. Sorry.

00:40:29
<transcript>: it's hard

00:40:35
<transcript>: It's hard to oh, I'm sorry I missed some some chatters. Let's see. Sure.

00:40:41
cedpoilly: hello @Corfliss

00:40:45
pigneedle: :D

00:40:52
<transcript>: That felt personal. Appreciate it, Pig Needle. Welcome to Chat Pic Needle. I'm glad you appreciate the confetti. And Radicide. Welcome to Chat. Rad. Aside, it is not AWS Wordal. That's a good idea as well. I think someone even mentioned that I'm gonna have any five letter service names. There are.

00:40:55
<transcript>: What.

00:40:55
<transcript>: do you use

00:41:02
<transcript>: Do you use to trigger the confetti my computer needs for confetti. It's Ray Cast. That was someone on Chat. I can't remember now. Sorry.

00:41:02
<transcript>: somebody recommended

00:41:06
<transcript>: Somebody recommended rate cast. That's all I use it for.

00:41:06
<transcript>: it's like

00:41:13
<transcript>: It's like a whole app and startup. I guess it's a whole thing that does lots of stuff, but I only use it.

00:41:13
<transcript>: for confetti

00:41:15
<transcript>: For confetti.

00:41:17
<transcript>: There you go.

00:41:23
<transcript>: Okay.

00:41:23
<transcript>: so

00:41:26
<transcript>: So it's not a Tobis word. It's like.

00:41:26
<transcript>: pick the

00:41:27
stroopwafel26: brb installing raycast just for the confetti so i can celebrate when my code works (not very often)

00:41:31
<transcript>: Pick the game or pick the A to BS service based on the tile.

00:41:33
<transcript>: Which key thing.

00:41:33
<transcript>: okay

00:41:38
<transcript>: Okay. So we want to say, Why can I yank this? I guess I could delete it.

00:41:38
<transcript>: let's delete

00:41:45
<transcript>: Let's delete two quotes. Right? Delete to quote. Okay, that worked. And then we're going to say.

00:41:53
<transcript>: Paste that in here. We're gonna say this is green. If.

00:41:53
<transcript>: the

00:41:59
<transcript>: The Elapsed is less than 100. Okay.

00:42:01
<transcript>: Oh, is elapsed.

00:42:04
<transcript>: All the laps. Right.

00:42:08
<transcript>: Oh, it's possibly undefined. I should read.

00:42:12
<transcript>: Is. It is the last possibly undefined.

00:42:12
<transcript>: look at maybe

00:42:14
<transcript>: Look at maybe six. That.

00:42:18
<transcript>: Let's just start it at zero, right.

00:42:22
<transcript>: Now it works. Okay.

00:42:22
<transcript>: elapse

00:42:25
<transcript>: Elapse So let's see, I'm gonna.

00:42:34
<transcript>: Laugh zero, and then Background Red. Nine. If elapse.

00:42:39
<transcript>: Elapse is greater than equal to 100 right.

00:42:39
<transcript>: it'll just be

00:42:44
<transcript>: It'll just be equal to 100 but I feel like it'd be safe for disagreed than equal. I don't know.

00:42:44
<transcript>: let's just

00:42:45
<transcript>: Let's just.

00:42:45
<transcript>: just

00:42:47
<transcript>: Just do that.

00:42:47
<transcript>: i think for the following

00:42:49
<transcript>: I think for the following.

00:42:56
<transcript>: True fossils installing styling rate cast just so confetti I love it which your code works not very often.

00:42:56
<transcript>: okay

00:42:58
<transcript>: Okay.

00:43:01
<transcript>: Now it's red. See, because we hit the timer.

00:43:01
<transcript>: maybe

00:43:08
<transcript>: Maybe we'll come up with some better things later, like animations or something to like, really signify that you missed it. You're too late.

00:43:16
<transcript>: Well, for one thing, we need to make a recant. Click the buttons right.

00:43:19
<transcript>: So where do we have disabled.

00:43:22
<transcript>: Where does disabled come from.

00:43:25
<transcript>: Disabled.

00:43:28
<transcript>: Hey.

00:43:37
<transcript>: Here we go. Answer mutation is Loading or result does not equal undefined. So once there's a result, we disabled the buttons.

00:43:42
<transcript>: We also need to disable the buttons if.

00:43:45
<transcript>: The round is expired.

00:43:46
cedpoilly: looking for a Linux equivalent of Raycast, that's my new objective of the day

00:43:47
<transcript>: So.

00:43:52
<transcript>: That's a bummer. The timer is happening inside the round.

00:43:52
<transcript>: but

00:43:55
<transcript>: But we kind of need to know something about.

00:43:55
<transcript>: i guess

00:43:59
<transcript>: I guess we could, I guess we know the round has it on there. Right.

00:43:59
<transcript>: so like right here

00:44:01
<transcript>: So like right here if I say.

00:44:05
<transcript>: Or.

00:44:07
<transcript>: Round.

00:44:11
<transcript>: Around my.

00:44:11
<transcript>: current round

00:44:12
<transcript>: Current round? Sorry.

00:44:13
stroopwafel26: oh cool i can also trigger the confetti after a for example a bash script completes

00:44:15
<transcript>: Current round.

00:44:15
<transcript>: exp

00:44:17
<transcript>: Expires.

00:44:19
<transcript>: Is less than.

00:44:25
<transcript>: Well, now this isn't gonna be.

00:44:28
<transcript>: I don't have a timer out here as well.

00:44:28
<transcript>: that feels really

00:44:29
princejoogie: is awguess hosted in aws?

00:44:34
<transcript>: That feels really bad, but it's got a rerender, like, we got to have the rerendering.

00:44:37
<transcript>: Oh, we could just have, like an on expired.

00:44:42
<transcript>: Maybe or just in here we could say disabled or asserts to feel bad.

00:44:57
<transcript>: Prince Juggy it is not hosted anywhere yet we're probably gonna deploy it to herself. So in a roundabout way it will be deployed on AWS, just not by me. Bye or so.

00:45:05
<transcript>: Looking for a Linux equivalent to Ray Cast. That's my new objective of the day. I'm glad we've given you some.

00:45:05
<transcript>: objectives

00:45:06
<transcript>: Objectives.

00:45:12
corfliss: Here's something to google in case you want a rabbit hole LUL : Codeforce

00:45:13
deadrobotdev: @stroopwafel26 If you do any coding in compiled languages, time to add "if success, play confetti" to your build scripts LUL

00:45:16
<transcript>: Okay. So.

00:45:16
<transcript>: here's

00:45:17
<transcript>: Here's.

00:45:17
<transcript>: something we

00:45:20
<transcript>: Something we know if.

00:45:23
<transcript>: Let's do this.

00:45:27
<transcript>: Final.

00:45:27
<transcript>: equals

00:45:29
<transcript>: Equals map.

00:45:36
<transcript>: Right.

00:45:36
<transcript>: yeah

00:45:37
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:45:41
stroopwafel26: @DeadRobotDev in my case that would not cause a lot of confetti to happen hahaha

00:45:43
<transcript>: Final.

00:45:48
<transcript>: Then we can say if final is.

00:45:51
<transcript>: Equals 100.

00:45:54
<transcript>: Could fire off like a.

00:45:54
<transcript>: vent

00:46:01
<transcript>: Vent. So we have on answer. What if we had, like, on expired? Yeah. I kind of like that. I don't know why I like that.

00:46:03
<transcript>: Like.

00:46:07
<transcript>: There's probably easier ways to do all of this, but.

00:46:09
<transcript>: On expired.

00:46:09
<transcript>: it's not gonna

00:46:11
<transcript>: It's not gonna have a choice.

00:46:13
<transcript>: It's gonna be like that.

00:46:16
<transcript>: Okay. I'll expired.

00:46:21
<transcript>: It's required so you have to pass it in so we can just say.

00:46:24
<transcript>: Unexpired.

00:46:24
<transcript>: right

00:46:25
<transcript>: Right.

00:46:32
<transcript>: Okay. No. Overload. Matches. This call. What did I do here? Set. Interval. What.

00:46:36
<transcript>: I do that just now.

00:46:36
<transcript>: do that

00:46:37
<transcript>: Do that.

00:46:41
<transcript>: What.

00:46:42
deadrobotdev: @stroopwafel26 That's a mood, haha

00:46:44
<transcript>: That's weird.

00:46:44
<transcript>: i

00:46:48
<transcript>: I Apparently I did some cool Vin thing that moved.

00:46:53
<transcript>: It move the oh, Geez, look on.

00:46:57
<transcript>: It move this hundred up here for some reason.

00:46:59
<transcript>: I don't know how I did this.

00:47:03
<transcript>: Honestly have no idea that's pretty cool actually.

00:47:05
<transcript>: Should be here. Right.

00:47:10
<transcript>: Missing the dependency on expired. Okay.

00:47:14
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow. Quit.

00:47:14
<transcript>: you guys have

00:47:20
<transcript>: You guys have hit me with a couple tough ones to say for me for my Ozarkian Hillbillion.

00:47:22
<transcript>: Accent.

00:47:22
<transcript>: it's

00:47:25
<transcript>: It's tough to say quiet. Insidim.

00:47:25
<transcript>: i'm missing

00:47:30
<transcript>: I'm missing like one Val in each of those. For it to be easy for me to say.

00:47:43
<transcript>: So now we have on expired.

00:47:43
<transcript>: and what we're

00:47:45
<transcript>: And what we're gonna do.

00:47:52
<transcript>: On expired in the parent a bit if I come up here. Yeah, it's missing on expired we're gonna say.

00:47:52
<transcript>: on exp

00:47:54
<transcript>: On expired.

00:47:56
<transcript>: Handles.

00:47:59
<transcript>: Fired.

00:48:05
<transcript>: I still am not in love with the way I'm doing some of this, like outside of the round.

00:48:08
<transcript>: There are reasons.

00:48:11
<transcript>: Async function.

00:48:16
<transcript>: Handle expired.

00:48:21
<transcript>: Like this. And then we're gonna say.

00:48:24
<transcript>: Set.

00:48:24
<transcript>: disabled

00:48:26
<transcript>: Disabled.

00:48:26
<transcript>: no

00:48:28
<transcript>: No, how do I do? Disabled.

00:48:31
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:48:31
<transcript>: guess i'm just gonna

00:48:33
<transcript>: Guess I'm just gonna have.

00:48:33
<transcript>: some state

00:48:39
<transcript>: Some state I don't know this is feeling worse and worse all the time expired. Set fired.

00:48:39
<transcript>: worse and we

00:48:44
<transcript>: Worse and we all the time react that use state.

00:48:51
<transcript>: I guess I don't need the.

00:48:57
<transcript>: Delete to e. Nope. To me. East. Delete.

00:48:57
<transcript>: okay

00:49:01
<transcript>: Okay. Well, here's what we'll do. We'll do delete.

00:49:04
<transcript>: Like that. I felt good.

00:49:04
<transcript>: felt real good

00:49:05
<transcript>: Felt real good.

00:49:11
<transcript>: Okay, so handle expired. We're gonna say.

00:49:14
<transcript>: Set expired.

00:49:14
<transcript>: true

00:49:15
<transcript>: True.

00:49:18
<transcript>: And then We're gonna.

00:49:18
<transcript>: hear

00:49:19
<transcript>: Hear.

00:49:22
<transcript>: Whenever we.

00:49:22
<transcript>: do

00:49:24
<transcript>: Do an answer.

00:49:26
<transcript>: So let's see.

00:49:30
<transcript>: If you try to answer when it's expired.

00:49:34
<transcript>: We should not do anything right.

00:49:38
<transcript>: If expired, return.

00:49:42
<transcript>: Is silent return like that bad.

00:49:45
<transcript>: But we have to also set.

00:49:45
<transcript>: here we need

00:49:49
<transcript>: Here we need to set expired to false.

00:49:53
<transcript>: Otherwise we never.

00:49:53
<transcript>: set

00:49:55
<transcript>: Set it back to false.

00:49:55
<transcript>: okay

00:50:00
<transcript>: Okay. And then down here we're going to say disabled is is Loading.

00:50:00
<transcript>: result is

00:50:01
<transcript>: Result is not undefined.

00:50:01
<transcript>: or

00:50:03
<transcript>: Or.

00:50:12
<transcript>: Expired.

00:50:20
<transcript>: That should disable all the buttons when it goes expired. Should turn red. All of that should be working now. New game. Let's do it.

00:50:26
<transcript>: So code build.

00:50:26
<transcript>: yeah

00:50:27
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:50:27
<transcript>: we got

00:50:30
<transcript>: We got stopped the timer too. Let's just do that now.

00:50:32
<transcript>: If.

00:50:32
<transcript>: once it hits

00:50:34
<transcript>: Once it hits, once you answer.

00:50:38
<transcript>: Stop the timer. Right.

00:50:43
<transcript>: How do we know that on and we have round. We have result.

00:50:48
<transcript>: On answer we could hook into on answer.

00:50:52
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:50:52
<transcript>: on

00:50:52
corfliss: You speak like you know how to explain things inside your head, me on the other hand feels like my mouth doing a murmur when doing that. LUL

00:50:54
<transcript>: On answer.

00:50:59
<transcript>: Here. Instead of okay. Instead of this. What if we did that.

00:51:04
<transcript>: What if we did handle answer here.

00:51:07
<transcript>: And then.

00:51:13
<transcript>: Function, handle.

00:51:13
<transcript>: answer

00:51:14
<transcript>: Answer.

00:51:17
<transcript>: Choice.

00:51:21
<transcript>: And in here we're gonna say.

00:51:24
<transcript>: Ultimately on answer.

00:51:24
<transcript>: choice

00:51:26
<transcript>: Choice.

00:51:33
<transcript>: But before we do that, we can say something about this expired. We can stop the timer somehow. Right.

00:51:35
<transcript>: So if I want to go.

00:51:35
<transcript>: twenty one

00:51:39
<transcript>: 21 up here. Yeah, I want to say.

00:51:41
<transcript>: Const.

00:51:43
<transcript>: construct

00:51:44
<transcript>: Construct.

00:51:47
<transcript>: Timer? What are we gonna do.

00:51:50
<transcript>: Answered.

00:51:52
<transcript>: This feels bad.

00:51:58
<transcript>: Feels bad to have all this weird state we have to keep track of but.

00:52:05
<transcript>: We're just running with it.

00:52:11
<transcript>: So answered it's set to true here and then when does it get set up.

00:52:20
<transcript>: When is it set to fall? We got to set this to false at some point.

00:52:24
<transcript>: And then being here we say.

00:52:24
<transcript>: we

00:52:26
<transcript>: We stop.

00:52:26
<transcript>: stop

00:52:29
<transcript>: Stop updating. Elapsed.

00:52:32
<transcript>: Answered right.

00:52:32
<transcript>: so

00:52:35
<transcript>: So if answered.

00:52:38
<transcript>: If not.

00:52:38
<transcript>: answered

00:52:39
<transcript>: Answered.

00:52:45
<transcript>: So we still have to.

00:52:50
<transcript>: We still have to.

00:53:04
<transcript>: Set answered defaults. When do we know that I'll answer this false? I guess we're gonna have to have like a use effect and we're gonna have to watch result with result comes in.

00:53:09
<transcript>: Oh, we could just okay so we could do.

00:53:14
<transcript>: Right. Okay. We can infer this if if result.

00:53:14
<transcript>: okay

00:53:15
<transcript>: Okay.

00:53:19
<transcript>: If.

00:53:21
<transcript>: Result.

00:53:27
<transcript>: There's a result. No if there's not a result. If result is undefined.

00:53:35
<transcript>: Then it's gonna have a little bit of a delay like you click to answer.

00:53:40
<transcript>: Oh? Choice? If choice? Yeah.

00:53:42
<transcript>: Choice.

00:53:42
<transcript>: equals

00:53:44
<transcript>: Equals undefined.

00:53:44
<transcript>: and we keep

00:53:48
<transcript>: And we keep on updating the timer right.

00:53:50
<transcript>: Think so.

00:53:50
<transcript>: thanks

00:53:53
<transcript>: Thanks. So so now when I do this.

00:53:53
<transcript>: now

00:53:56
<transcript>: Now we can just go back to.

00:54:08
<transcript>: Navigate, better.

00:54:13
<transcript>: On answer. Right. Okay.

00:54:26
<transcript>: You speak like you know how to explain things inside your head. Me, on the other hand, feels like my mouth doing a murmur when doing that.

00:54:31
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't know. I'm just.

00:54:31
<transcript>: extremely

00:54:37
<transcript>: Extremely processing. It's not something I feel like I did before I started streaming. That's Neptune, right.

00:54:40
<transcript>: Timer stopped. Cool.

00:54:44
<transcript>: Oh, but then it jumped ahead. You see that that's no good. That's light sail.

00:54:44
<transcript>: watch this

00:54:45
<transcript>: Watch this.

00:54:45
<transcript>: yeah

00:54:50
<transcript>: Yeah, that's not good. So it still count. It's still updates. Okay.

00:54:50
<transcript>: what

00:54:52
<transcript>: What is this one.

00:54:52
<transcript>: repo

00:54:54
beardotdev: what's a good vim cheatsheet

00:54:56
<transcript>: Repo. Now Sorry, this Chime Voice connector.

00:55:10
<transcript>: A good vimchi cheat. I don't know if you find one. I would love a good vim cheat sheet. That'll work. Oh, no. Something just straight up. Didn't work. You see that? I clicked it. Nothing happened.

00:55:17
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't know. Does anyone in Chat? No of a good vimchi cheat.

00:55:21
<transcript>: Pinpoint.

00:55:32
<transcript>: There's a little tip for you.

00:55:36
<transcript>: Console mobile application.

00:55:38
<transcript>: Cool.

00:55:38
<transcript>: forecast

00:55:38
corfliss: Codeforce. Ring a bell when hearing that?

00:55:39
<transcript>: Forecast.

00:55:44
<transcript>: Because we need to fix how it jumps at the end. There.

00:55:49
<transcript>: Auto scaling device form.

00:55:55
<transcript>: Memory DB for Redis.

00:56:00
<transcript>: Private link.

00:56:08
<transcript>: It's actually kind of intuitive. Like you can mostly look at the picture and guess it's workspaces. Yeah.

00:56:08
<transcript>: you don't have

00:56:11
beardotdev: @stroopwafel26 that's down for me only ?

00:56:13
<transcript>: You don't have to have a ton of AWS knowledge to enjoy this game. I don't think.

00:56:16
<transcript>: Connect.

00:56:17
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:56:23
<transcript>: Sandra, thank you so much for the sub.

00:56:23
<transcript>: thank you

00:56:25
stroopwafel26: @stroopwafel26 i copy pasted it from my bookmarks, down indeed :(

00:56:25
corfliss: Actually, that vim link is also useful for me too.

00:56:27
<transcript>: Thank you so much. 3 miles for Sandra.

00:56:27
<transcript>: wow

00:56:28
<transcript>: Wow.

00:56:32
<transcript>: I'm not getting notifications.

00:56:32
<transcript>: on things

00:56:38
<transcript>: On things that I expect to get notifications for. I don't know why I thought I'd get one for that, but.

00:56:43
<transcript>: I mean, I see it in the activity, but I didn't hear it.

00:56:45
<transcript>: I didn't hear it.

00:56:49
<transcript>: Vim R Two RTOR.

00:56:57
beardotdev: https://vim.rtorr.com/lang/en_en this is loading

00:56:58
<transcript>: Oh, it's down. Okay, don't use that one.

00:57:09
<transcript>: Okay. So.

00:57:13
<transcript>: We got some stuff to fix I don't love.

00:57:13
<transcript>: don't love

00:57:16
<transcript>: Don't love a lot of this frontend. It just feels.

00:57:18
tiredbeaver: how is the t3 stack so far?

00:57:20
stroopwafel26: he'll fix it i'm sure

00:57:24
<transcript>: Like the way I'm doing. State management feels very flaky. Maybe I should have used state machines, or maybe it'd be worse then, because I'm not good at it.

00:57:24
<transcript>: so it

00:57:31
<transcript>: So it shouldn't let me click on these now. It's expired, right? Yeah. So it doesn't. The problem is when it expires, we need to.

00:57:31
<transcript>: give you

00:57:33
<transcript>: Give you a new round, right.

00:57:35
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:57:38
<transcript>: Where would that be.

00:57:38
<transcript>: i

00:57:41
<transcript>: I would be on expired to unexpired.

00:57:46
<transcript>: Handle expired.

00:57:55
<transcript>: Here. So it said expired to true. But then we need to set a timer like this one.

00:57:55
<transcript>: okay

00:58:01
<transcript>: Okay. So let's just do this that set timeout. Oh, we're not handling.

00:58:01
<transcript>: cleaning

00:58:02
<transcript>: Cleaning that up.

00:58:05
<transcript>: I should clean that up. Right.

00:58:13
wesleycoder: 👋 hello

00:58:13
<transcript>: Now. I guess I shouldn't. I don't know. Should I clean that up.

00:58:22
<transcript>: Should I clean it up? Like right here? Should I say clear timeout.

00:58:22
<transcript>: like i said

00:58:23
wesleycoder: when I'm im

00:58:23
<transcript>: Like I said.

00:58:32
<transcript>: Okay, but we're gonna move all this code. This code should all happen.

00:58:40
<transcript>: In like a function that I can call multiple for other things. Right? I need to reuse it. So async function.

00:58:43
<transcript>: New round.

00:58:45
<transcript>: Right.

00:58:45
<transcript>: it's gonna

00:58:45
wesleycoder: whoops, I'm on mobile, typing is hard

00:58:49
<transcript>: It's gonna be all of that code here.

00:58:50
<transcript>: So.

00:58:55
<transcript>: Okay.

00:58:55
<transcript>: and then it's

00:58:57
<transcript>: And then It's gonna be.

00:58:57
<transcript>: new

00:58:59
<transcript>: New round.

00:59:06
<transcript>: That.

00:59:11
<transcript>: Current round Where is current round.

00:59:14
<transcript>: Asic as possible. Undefined. Okay.

00:59:21
<transcript>: That doesn't work.

00:59:21
<transcript>: why would it be

00:59:26
<transcript>: Why would it be undefined at this point? And how did it know down here that it wasn't.

00:59:30
<transcript>: So current round.

00:59:30
<transcript>: how did it

00:59:34
<transcript>: How did it know? Because if not current round return. Okay, we can do that.

00:59:34
<transcript>: that

00:59:36
<transcript>: That up here too.

00:59:40
<transcript>: Right here, right.

00:59:43
<transcript>: Not Car round return.

00:59:56
<transcript>: Okay, so that won't work for the first round, but that's okay. We get the first round a different way so we can only call new round after the first round. Sex fire, false response set current round and then clear time out. Okay.

00:59:56
<transcript>: so now

00:59:59
cowfacedude99: did you fix the timer?

01:00:00
<transcript>: So now we can call New round anytime we need.

01:00:00
<transcript>: new

01:00:04
<transcript>: New round? I mean, doesn't it handle expired.

01:00:04
<transcript>: sex fire

01:00:06
<transcript>: Sex fired, and then.

01:00:10
<transcript>: New round.

01:00:16
<transcript>: It does it after a timer like a timeout there goes, Oh.

01:00:20
<transcript>: What does that mean? See that.

01:00:21
<transcript>: Look bad.

01:00:23
<transcript>: Ecs.

01:00:27
<transcript>: Let's just let it expire this time.

01:00:28
cowfacedude99: apparently you did.

01:00:32
<transcript>: I'm guessing that's neuron.

01:00:32
<transcript>: oh

01:00:42
<transcript>: Oh, when it expires, we need to show the right answer to man, there's just so many things when you build a game. Oh, look at that. It's broken it did it like a hundred times. Did you see it.

01:00:44
<transcript>: Okay.

01:00:44
<transcript>: let's not

01:00:46
<transcript>: Let's not do that.

01:00:54
cowfacedude99: and I don't think you did LUL

01:00:57
<transcript>: So why did it do that so many times handle expired. Oh, does he expire just get called like a ton.

01:00:58
<transcript>: But it does.

01:01:05
<transcript>: Yeah. Look at that.

01:01:08
<transcript>: Handle expire just keeps getting called.

01:01:08
<transcript>: forever

01:01:10
<transcript>: Forever and ever.

01:01:12
<transcript>: That's a problem.

01:01:16
<transcript>: It'll expire. On expired. Okay.

01:01:20
<transcript>: So.

01:01:20
<transcript>: i guess

01:01:24
<transcript>: I guess I need to go to on expired.

01:01:28
<transcript>: Finally equals 100.

01:01:32
<transcript>: I don't love the way I'm doing state management don't love it.

01:01:41
<transcript>: Yeah. Did I fix the timer? Yes and no. Cafe? Yes and no. Wesley coders. Here. Cafes. Is here.

01:01:46
<transcript>: How's the T three stack? So far? Tired, Beaver. I love it. It's great.

01:01:46
<transcript>: tmbc

01:01:48
<transcript>: Tmbc's great.

01:01:48
<transcript>: i think

01:01:53
<transcript>: I think that was the only piece that I wasn't really that familiar with Prisma. I also don't really use Prisma.

01:01:57
danielgerep: schrödinger timer =)

01:02:06
<transcript>: And I'm semi new to planet scale, so yeah, they're just more than that, but I use like next JS and tailwind all the time. So the front end part I'm still bad at the front end part didn't get any better at it because I'm using T three.

01:02:13
<transcript>: Shrouding your timer.

01:02:13
<transcript>: okay we got

01:02:15
<transcript>: Okay, we gotta fix this timer.

01:02:26
<transcript>: It. We fixed it. And yet we didn't. We didn't. We didn't fix it. Right. So if choice is undefined, we can update the timer.

01:02:33
<transcript>: This is a statement, isn't it? This whole game saying, should be a state machine. I think.

01:02:33
<transcript>: that's the problem

01:02:36
<transcript>: That's the problem. I'm trying to do this with a bunch of.

01:02:36
<transcript>: duct taped

01:02:40
<transcript>: Duct taped U state, and it should be a big state machine. I think.

01:02:42
<transcript>: It definitely should be.

01:02:46
<transcript>: Alright.

01:02:50
<transcript>: X stated it is let's do it.

01:02:54
<transcript>: Topics building AW guess.

01:02:58
<transcript>: And I.

01:03:00
<transcript>: Yes.

01:03:03
adamdotdev: !topic building awguess, and I *guess* we'll use xstate

01:03:04
<transcript>: We'll use xDate.

01:03:15
stroopwafel26: I guess

01:03:16
<transcript>: Okay, well, here we go. Let's do it. X state. I have very little experiences. I state, like very little. Let's see how good their docs are.

01:03:21
stroopwafel26: see what you did there

01:03:30
<transcript>: Should I put it in the title so that maybe David will show up last time I put X state in the title. David and Matt Pococ showed up and they were like, here's how you do state machines. I got DMs later with like.

01:03:30
<transcript>: working

01:03:31
wesleycoder: when I'm in doubt about using state machines I start by choosing one of this 2 strategie: 1 -  abstracting my behaviors into an object map keyed by behavior name and values are the component that should be rendered by this behavior. 2 - each behavior gets its own component and I keep the current logic

01:03:34
<transcript>: Working state machines that solve my problem. I feel like I should do it.

01:03:34
<transcript>: feel like maybe i should

01:03:36
<transcript>: Feel like maybe I should.

01:03:37
beardotdev: try jotai.

01:03:52
<transcript>: When I'm in doubt about using state machines, I start by choosing one of this two strategies, one behaviors into an object map, keyed by behavior, name, and values as a component that should be rendered by this behavior to each behavior gets its own component, and I keep the current logic.

01:03:56
<transcript>: That makes sense, that makes sense.

01:04:00
<transcript>: Try Joe. Tie Jatai.

01:04:05
<transcript>: Can we get a print? A pronunciation check on Joe tie.

01:04:10
<transcript>: Could be Joe, Tie, could be Jatai.

01:04:10
<transcript>: could be

01:04:11
<transcript>: Could be.

01:04:13
<transcript>: That's probably it.

01:04:22
<transcript>: Probably the only way you could say that, right. But it's always gonna the second syllable is always gonna be tie Pai is like Thai, right.

01:04:22
<transcript>: ta

01:04:22
wesleycoder: zustand or jotai can help too

01:04:24
<transcript>: Taiwan.

01:04:24
<transcript>: thai

01:04:25
<transcript>: Thai.

01:04:25
<transcript>: kwondo

01:04:27
<transcript>: Kwondo.

01:04:27
<transcript>: zus stand

01:04:29
beardotdev: it's from chinese. it means ghost or smth

01:04:33
fragaverage: could be yotai

01:04:34
<transcript>: Zus stand where Joe Ty can help, too. You're saying I don't need X state? I should use Jutai? Or is that stand.

01:04:34
<transcript>: means

01:04:36
wesleycoder: Jötai

01:04:37
<transcript>: Means ghost or something. Oh, interesting.

01:04:37
<transcript>: could be

01:04:38
stroopwafel26: is zustand german?

01:04:40
<transcript>: Could be Yo, tie oh, it could be.

01:04:40
<transcript>: it could be

01:04:41
<transcript>: It could be.

01:04:47
<transcript>: Yens? Is it yotai? Am I saying it wrong.

01:04:50
<transcript>: Bear says it's from.

01:04:50
<transcript>: its chinese

01:04:51
<transcript>: Its Chinese so.

01:04:56
<transcript>: Oh, what's the two dot see, I don't even know how to read to pronounciation stuff.

01:04:56
<transcript>: is

01:04:58
wesleycoder: I prefer xstate

01:05:02
<transcript>: Is it? Is it two dots? Make it Jotie or Joe Ty pair more. Thanks so much for the follow.

01:05:11
<transcript>: All that to say, Wes Dakota prefers X state. I think this is like, probably where I want to go. I think if I'm learning something, I want to learn X state.

01:05:13
<transcript>: Docs.

01:05:13
<transcript>: show you

01:05:18
<transcript>: Show you use the visualizer to build my game state machine maybe.

01:05:18
wesleycoder: but is preference

01:05:20
<transcript>: Just maybe.

01:05:25
parkour_peter: hello everyone!

01:05:37
<transcript>: I think it's a state machine. I think all these various intertwined state problems would be better expressed with state machine. Hello, Parkour. Peter. Welcome. How you doing today.

01:05:41
<transcript>: Offspreet. Thank you for the follow. I appreciate that. Follow.

01:05:45
<transcript>: Hope you come back hope that's what that means.

01:05:50
wesleycoder: djôtai

01:05:52
<transcript>: Visualizer. Let's try and build this state machine in the visualizer. This sounds fun. I think this is worth doing.

01:05:57
<transcript>: Okay.

01:06:00
<transcript>: Context retries.

01:06:04
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:06:04
<transcript>: zoom in

01:06:06
<transcript>: Zoom in.

01:06:12
<transcript>: Who here's? Good at state Machines, modeling and state machines.

01:06:15
<transcript>: We're gonna need you.

01:06:19
<transcript>: Let's think about this. So we context what is the state that we have.

01:06:22
<transcript>: The current round.

01:06:25
cowfacedude99: might be a god idea to go full screen on the browser

01:06:25
<transcript>: Is a thing that we have.

01:06:28
danielgerep: Why a state machine? Isn't this a choice game?

01:06:28
<transcript>: I'm not gonna have my types.

01:06:30
<transcript>: That's a problem.

01:06:37
<transcript>: Maybe I can work with just some crudely defined types.

01:06:43
<transcript>: Might be a good idea to go full screen on the browser. That's a good idea.

01:06:45
<transcript>: Okay.

01:06:45
<transcript>: we're gonna

01:06:51
<transcript>: We're gonna ride a state machine to express this game logic because it's getting two.

01:06:53
<transcript>: It's getting.

01:06:53
<transcript>: two

01:06:54
<transcript>: Two.

01:06:55
wesleycoder: start by describing the user behavior

01:06:58
<transcript>: Squarely is the word I want to use. I don't know if that's a good one.

01:06:58
<transcript>: joe tie

01:07:00
<transcript>: Joe Tie? Is it Jotie.

01:07:03
<transcript>: Y Estate Machine Isn't this a choice game.

01:07:03
<transcript>: it is

01:07:07
<transcript>: It is so Daniel, it's a choice game.

01:07:07
<transcript>: but

01:07:16
parkour_peter: rainy day in poland, atmospheric pressure headaches, lack of strength to work

01:07:27
<transcript>: But there's, like, it can expire. And when it expires, when you need to get a new round, and we need to prevent you from choosing again. There's just, I don't know. Does that sound like enough for a state machine? Starting to feel like enough to me because I've got, like, five use States in two different places, and they all interact in ways. And the timing is off. And like.

01:07:27
<transcript>: feel like there's

01:07:31
<transcript>: Feel like there's just like some clearly defined States. I need to transition between.

01:07:35
<transcript>: And I'm not doing it very well.

01:07:35
<transcript>: with my

01:07:38
<transcript>: With my just use state usage.

01:07:38
<transcript>: does that make sense

01:07:39
<transcript>: Does that make sense.

01:07:45
barneyoftherubble: my mom always said I was a handsome model

01:07:46
cowfacedude99: I haven't dealt with state machines for 2+ years :(

01:07:47
<transcript>: By describing the user behavior. Okay. So the user behavior is.

01:07:47
<transcript>: you

01:07:56
<transcript>: You start a new game so you could be at the menu screen. I guess the state machine should go all the way back to there like you haven't actually started a game yet.

01:07:58
<transcript>: Or should we just build the statement.

01:07:58
<transcript>: for

01:08:02
<transcript>: For like a current running game state maybe.

01:08:02
<transcript>: anyone have opinions

01:08:04
<transcript>: Anyone have opinions on that.

01:08:18
<transcript>: Two plus years for cafes. I believe in you got this. I've seen your ability to teach me things. And it's stellar. So I have faith that you will figure it out.

01:08:25
<transcript>: Rainy day in Poland. Atmospheric pressure, headaches. Lack of strength to work. You know what? I was just thinking, how I have a headache.

01:08:25
<transcript>: and i don't

01:08:27
<transcript>: And I don't know why I don't get a lot of headaches.

01:08:38
<transcript>: The weather's changing here today is like the first day of fall. And it's actually the first day it's been cold yesterday. It was like 95 here and today. Oh, sorry.

01:08:38
<transcript>: whatever that

01:08:40
<transcript>: Whatever that is, it's Celsius.

01:08:43
<transcript>: I'm gonna say like, 38.

01:08:43
<transcript>: yesterday

01:08:46
<transcript>: Yesterday was like 38 Degrees Celsius.

01:08:46
<transcript>: today

01:08:48
<transcript>: Today it's.

01:08:48
<transcript>: who knows

01:08:50
stroopwafel26: 32 c

01:08:55
<transcript>: Who knows? Fahrenheit Celsius. Can someone convert this for me? I could do it on the Internet. I guess today it's just.

01:08:58
<transcript>: Fahrenheit.

01:09:01
<transcript>: Today it's gonna be a high of seven, two.

01:09:04
beardotdev: i'd go from menu with something like: isRunning, currentScore, lastScore (if you want to implement scoring)

01:09:04
<transcript>: Fahrenheit Celsius.

01:09:08
<transcript>: Today it's gonna be higher, 22 degrees Celsius.

01:09:08
<transcript>: yesterday

01:09:09
<transcript>: Yesterday.

01:09:11
wesleycoder: you can start by modeling a small part if you want

01:09:16
<transcript>: It was 35 degrees Celsius, so big drop today. And that could be why my head hurts.

01:09:16
<transcript>: it's possible

01:09:16
fragaverage: "cold"

01:09:17
parkour_peter: there is about 10 C

01:09:17
<transcript>: It's possible.

01:09:17
<transcript>: why what did i do

01:09:19
<transcript>: Why? What did I do here.

01:09:20
fragaverage: 😂😂😂

01:09:21
<transcript>: I want to close this down.

01:09:25
<transcript>: I don't know how to do that in full screen.

01:09:28
<transcript>: Okay.

01:09:35
<transcript>: Barney. Barney is a rebel, handsome model. All right.

01:09:38
<transcript>: Hey, Barney.

01:09:41
<transcript>: 32 degrees. Thank You, Stroop.

01:09:41
<transcript>: i'd go from mini

01:09:56
<transcript>: I'd go from Mini is something like is running current score last score if you want to implement scoring. Yeah, we're gonna do scoring for sure. There's gonna be a leaderboard. We got stuff to do. You can start by modeling a small part if you want. Yeah, let's do that. We'll just not worry about the we'll just worry about the running game. State.

01:09:59
<transcript>: Cold.

01:09:59
<transcript>: that works

01:10:04
<transcript>: That works too frag. So the different States we have we have.

01:10:07
stroopwafel26: I do fahrenheit to celcius in my head but I'm sometimes off by a few degrees because fahrenheit is WEIRD :P

01:10:07
<transcript>: The state where you're actively.

01:10:07
<transcript>: getting

01:10:08
<transcript>: Getting.

01:10:08
<transcript>: like the

01:10:11
<transcript>: Like the timer has not expired yet.

01:10:11
<transcript>: so what

01:10:14
<transcript>: So what of the States is.

01:10:14
<transcript>: success

01:10:19
<transcript>: Success. Oh, in failure, those are kind of the States like you guess wrong or you guess right.

01:10:22
<transcript>: Correct. We'll say correct.

01:10:22
<transcript>: and incorrect

01:10:24
<transcript>: And incorrect.

barneyoftherubble: weird temp to celcius is -32 and then divide by 2

01:10:31
<transcript>: Okay, I'm gonna ignore the contents of these States. I'm just trying to list out some States. Expired.

01:10:34
parkour_peter: 10 C = 50 F

01:10:38
<transcript>: And is Idle, the best name for the state where you're trying to guess.

01:10:38
<transcript>: or is active

01:10:40
<transcript>: Or is active. Maybe active.

01:10:50
<transcript>: Strip you can do Fahrenheit Associates in your head. That's awesome.

01:10:53
<transcript>: Fahrenheit is weird.

01:11:00
<transcript>: Weird temp. The Celsius is -32 in the divide by two. I've heard that maybe.

01:11:00
<transcript>: two dozen times

01:11:02
tayloreddev: we have different definitions of cold , 22c is peak summer in the UK LUL

01:11:08
<transcript>: Two dozen times in my life, Barney, and it's never stuck. I'm just not hesitate enough, I guess. But maybe now that I've got all these European friends.

01:11:08
<transcript>: international

01:11:10
stroopwafel26: @BarneyOfTheRubble this

01:11:12
<transcript>: International friends maybe you guys will help me.

01:11:12
<transcript>: convert it

01:11:14
<transcript>: Convert it in my head maybe I'll get there.

01:11:20
<transcript>: All right.

01:11:20
<transcript>: so

01:11:28
<transcript>: So these. Do you sound like our States active, expired, correct or incorrect? Are there any other States in the middle of a game that you can get into.

01:11:33
<transcript>: I don't believe so. I think you're either actively trying to answer.

01:11:35
barneyoftherubble: thats a lie tayloreddev you poms whinge all the time that it got to 40 and you're in a meltdown

01:11:38
<transcript>: You then answer within the timer, you're either correct or incorrect.

01:11:38
<transcript>: or you don't

01:11:38
beardotdev: @TayloredDev heard it was like 30C and above this summer ...

01:11:45
<transcript>: Or you don't answer within the timer and it expires you're in the expired state and then you go from expired back to active.

01:11:50
<transcript>: You go from all these back to active, really? Right.

01:11:53
<transcript>: Okay.

01:11:53
<transcript>: we're gonna

01:11:54
tayloreddev: crazy heatwaves aside

01:11:56
stroopwafel26: we had 40+ in europe this summer

01:11:56
<transcript>: We're gonna call this the Game machine.

01:11:58
stroopwafel26: brutal

01:12:01
fragaverage: idle to me is like pre-game state

01:12:02
<transcript>: Context. So we're gonna keep track of some stuff.

01:12:12
<transcript>: Taylor's Here we have different definitions of cold. 22. Celsius Pete Summer in the UK Is there a really.

01:12:20
barneyoftherubble: suspended

01:12:21
cowfacedude99: for me 20 is the coldest we get

01:12:23
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, no, I did see all the Tweets about how it was like, a hundred degrees. There 40 degrees Celsius, whatever it is, I saw those tweets.

01:12:23
<transcript>: you guys had some

01:12:25
<transcript>: You guys had some heat.

01:12:30
<transcript>: Idol is like a pregame state. Yeah, I guess like before you start the game.

01:12:30
<transcript>: you're idle

01:12:30
parkour_peter: Yeah, england is cold hah

01:12:31
<transcript>: You're idle.

01:12:36
<transcript>: Don't know anything about X eight. I tried to use them key bindings just now.

01:12:36
<transcript>: idle

01:12:38
barneyoftherubble: What if I need the toilet for 12 hours?

01:12:38
<transcript>: Idle.

01:12:38
<transcript>: idle

01:12:39
cowfacedude99: but we don't go beyond 35 ish

01:12:39
<transcript>: Idle.

01:12:43
<transcript>: So what do we have here? We have type.

01:12:46
<transcript>: On so when it goes to the state.

01:12:50
<transcript>: We do this. I'm guessing you can do that with a delay.

01:12:56
<transcript>: On, Fetch, what is? Fetch.

01:12:59
<transcript>: Like.

01:12:59
<transcript>: when it goes

01:13:01
<transcript>: When it goes to the state, fetch.

01:13:01
<transcript>: we go

01:13:04
<transcript>: We go to Loading. Or what is that? What is the fetch. This.

01:13:05
stroopwafel26: @cowfacedude99 where is this?

01:13:05
fragaverage: we get to 25C and the UK goes into meltdown 😅

01:13:10
wesleycoder: you can look at your setState call for clues about possible states

01:13:10
<transcript>: Anyone knows what? Fetches.

01:13:14
<transcript>: Trying to understand.

01:13:34
parkour_peter: this year's record in poland is 38 C (100,4 F)

01:13:36
<transcript>: Suspended if you need to pause it, I guess we could have pausing Coach Award thanks so much for the follow Coach award.

01:13:36
cowfacedude99: @cowfacedude99 welcome to the beautiful paradise in Goa/India

01:13:40
<transcript>: Yeah, we could do that. We could say you can pause the game.

01:13:41
<transcript>: But.

01:13:41
<transcript>: i'm gonna

01:13:43
wesleycoder: fetch is an event

01:13:45
<transcript>: I'm gonna say no pausing? I'm gonna say it's gonna be a short game.

01:13:45
<transcript>: oh so

01:13:48
stroopwafel26: ooh in india

01:13:49
<transcript>: Oh, so there is another state. The game ends.

01:13:52
barneyoftherubble: What is the driving factor that so many web devs is suddenly using neovim?

01:14:00
<transcript>: Is that just idle? Like the game will eventually end. There'll be like a total timer. Maybe you're trying to get as many as you can in two minutes or give it the highest score you can in two minutes or something.

01:14:10
<transcript>: So there's no pausing. If you pause, that's just gonna throw in so much more complexity, like when we get to multiplayer. You can't pause. I don't know. I'm gonna say no pausing.

01:14:10
<transcript>: look at

01:14:12
wesleycoder: on fetch is something that happens, an action

01:14:14
<transcript>: Look at your set. State. Call for clues about possible States.

01:14:16
cowfacedude99: @BarneyOfTheRubble they got sick of vs**** LUL

01:14:22
<transcript>: Fetches. An event on fetch is something that happens in action. Okay.

01:14:25
<transcript>: Okay.

01:14:25
<transcript>: barney what do

01:14:29
<transcript>: Barney, what do the driving factors? So many web devs suddenly using new of them so for me.

01:14:33
<transcript>: I'm using the oven because it's a lot of fun.

01:14:33
<transcript>: i'm just

01:14:35
fragaverage: clout LUL

01:14:37
barneyoftherubble: I always got abused for saying vim was good cowfacedude99

01:14:37
stroopwafel26: we can say vscode in here, it's not prime's stream

01:14:38
tayloreddev: The prime effect

01:14:45
<transcript>: I'm just having a ton of fun with it. I mean, I only would have I would have never started using the of them if I didn't get on Twitch and see all the neo vimmers. There's a lot in the Ovim devs on Twitter. I mean devs that.

01:14:45
<transcript>: use neo

01:14:49
wesleycoder: game ends is a state too

01:14:50
<transcript>: Use neo them. And then there's actual neo them. Dense like PH.

01:14:50
<transcript>: yeah i

01:14:59
<transcript>: Yeah. I think just like, coming into this community, seeing all these people use it, it's like I'm curious. I've been using vs. Code for five years. I should try something else, and I love it.

01:14:59
<transcript>: the

01:15:06
cowfacedude99: @stroopwafel26 habits die hard LUL

01:15:08
<transcript>: The vim is the part that I love. I mean, I think that's the satisfying feeling while programming is like I'm finally learning them. I've wanted to for years.

01:15:08
<transcript>: there's

01:15:12
<transcript>: There's just some nice feelings you get when you hit certain commands.

01:15:12
<transcript>: you get

01:15:16
<transcript>: You get a combination, right. And you do a thing very efficiently. It feels good.

01:15:16
<transcript>: neil vim

01:15:25
clbagrat: di{

01:15:35
clbagrat: di{ did blow my mind

01:15:37
<transcript>: Neil Vim has been fun. It's like a hobby. It's been fun to configure it. And to just like, tweak it to my exact wants, you know what I mean? So I could I have, like, just use vs. Code, added Vin bindings, and probably saved a ton of time. Yes, but that time that I saved was time invested in a hobby that I'm enjoying. So I use neovan. I don't know about our bales, but that's why I'm doing it.

01:15:39
<transcript>: Yeah. The prime effect. Exactly.

01:15:39
<transcript>: prime is

01:15:44
<transcript>: Prime is cool. I like prime. He uses the OVM. So I use the oven.

01:15:47
<transcript>: That's a simpler way I could have put on that.

01:15:50
<transcript>: So events.

01:15:53
<transcript>: Of events.

01:16:01
<transcript>: Game ends as a state. Maybe it is. Yeah. Complete.

01:16:06
barneyoftherubble: neovim is like windows..... it installs everything rather than vim that only installs what you need

01:16:08
<transcript>: Tight final. I know that we already have a type final, but we're gonna fix that.

01:16:08
<transcript>: so

01:16:10
<transcript>: So correct is not a final.

01:16:15
<transcript>: I gotta figure out I got to understand now.

01:16:18
<transcript>: How events work.

01:16:22
<transcript>: I'm gonna go out of full screen here, and we're gonna read a little bit.

01:16:28
<transcript>: Just gonna get educated on X state.

01:16:32
instafluff: sofieLurk

01:16:33
cowfacedude99: @BarneyOfTheRubble Are you sure, it is basically vim with sane defaults.

01:16:34
<transcript>: Look, it's some like get started.

01:16:34
<transcript>: stuff

01:16:35
<transcript>: Stuff.

01:16:36
tiredbeaver: do you really need xstate

01:16:41
<transcript>: Stay chart.

01:16:44
<transcript>: Catalog of examples.

01:16:44
<transcript>: that might be a good place

01:16:46
<transcript>: That might be a good place to start.

01:16:48
<transcript>: Getting started.

01:16:48
<transcript>: i guess

01:16:52
<transcript>: I guess I have to install X state for one thing we'll have to do that.

01:16:57
barneyoftherubble: cowfacedude99: have you seen the plugins and coding changes?

01:17:01
<transcript>: Transitions to the state nodes, so on resolve target. Resolved.

01:17:01
<transcript>: on re

01:17:04
wesleycoder: events are similar to dispatch calls on Redux

01:17:04
<transcript>: On reject that all makes sense. Okay.

01:17:13
<transcript>: Final state node since a promise machine terminates running once it reaches the States, okay.

01:17:22
<transcript>: Use machine hook. This is what we're going to be doing.

01:17:25
cowfacedude99: @BarneyOfTheRubble the lua stuff?

01:17:30
<transcript>: So state matches pending. Okay. Yeah. I think I'm gonna like the way this is gonna render? The way it's gonna play out, like in the tree.

01:17:30
<transcript>: in our actual

01:17:33
<transcript>: In our actual like components.

01:17:37
<transcript>: State machine.

01:17:40
<transcript>: Here we go. This is what I need.

01:17:40
<transcript>: states

01:17:43
<transcript>: States are represented by random, rectangle, rectangle boxes.

01:17:46
wesleycoder: instead of dispatch you call send

01:17:54
<transcript>: Sleep and awake transitions, and of ants. Here we go. How the dog goes between sleep and awake is through transitions, which are symbolized by an arrow pointing from one state to the next.

01:18:05
<transcript>: Transitions caused by an event that results in the change of state. Transitions are labeled with their events. Okay, so this is the wakes up event that falls asleep. Event.

01:18:12
<transcript>: Okay. I need to actually take a quick break because I got a pee. I just got a P. Insta. Fluff is here.

01:18:12
<transcript>: instafuff

01:18:13
<transcript>: Instafuff.

01:18:13
<transcript>: welcome to

01:18:15
cowfacedude99: or are you trying to convince me that vim9script is the new cool thing..... that's something I don't want to deal with LUL

01:18:19
instafluff: hello!!

01:18:19
<transcript>: Welcome to my chat. Instafuff is a new friend of mine. We were already we're old friends, actually on Twitter.

01:18:19
<transcript>: but

01:18:34
instafluff: i saw you were on maayaPeek

01:18:34
<transcript>: But I'm just now meeting Instaflouff on Twitch. It's funny how that works, how you can kind of know someone somewhere. And then you meet him somewhere else. And you know him better now, like I know it's just left a lot better now that I've seen him speak. I've watched him.

01:18:34
<transcript>: interact

01:18:38
<transcript>: Interact with Twitch Chat. He's very kind.

01:18:38
<transcript>: soph

01:18:43

01:18:45
tiredbeaver: watching him??...creepy LUL

01:18:50
instafluff: thank you!

01:18:52
<transcript>: I'm just trying to do you need X state? Maybe not tired, Beaver? Maybe not. I think I think I want it, though.

01:18:56
cowfacedude99: sorry @adamdotdev for the nvim rant LUL

01:19:00
<transcript>: I think I want to. Wesley coder. Thank you so much for gifting. A sub. Wesley coatr. Thank you so much. I appreciate that.

01:19:01

01:19:02
<transcript>: You saw I was on.

01:19:04

wesleycoder: welcome

01:19:13
<transcript>: Sorry for the inventory. Oh yeah. You're good cafes. I love ranting about invent that's good times.

01:19:22

01:22:16
barneyoftherubble: This music reminds me of a streamer who makes tunes on a real commodore 64. no VM or emulator. Its pretty cool!

01:22:30
barneyoftherubble: stroopwafel26 its a mac ultimate

01:22:39
stroopwafel26: so you can take it outdoors?

01:22:52
barneyoftherubble: only on sundays

01:23:19
stroopwafel26: mac mini, now with crash detection

cowfacedude99: @BarneyOfTheRubble I am a nixbtw and I don't like microsoft for the stuff they pull off with windows and python lsp.

01:24:44

01:24:48
<transcript>: Diego, thank you for the follow. I came back right in time.

01:24:48
<transcript>: to see

01:24:51
<transcript>: To see your follow. I appreciate it.

01:24:54
<transcript>: Okay. So we're doing.

01:25:05
<transcript>: We're doing the X state thing. I do think I want to use Xtate here. I know. I thought one time I was gonna use X state, and then I ended up not using it. This time, I think I really want to use it.

01:25:05
<transcript>: rexace

01:25:08
<transcript>: Rexace also think it to the follow.

01:25:08
<transcript>: so

01:25:17
<transcript>: So we're trying to build this thing out with X data. I just think the game. I think it makes sense. There's just enough stuff going on on the front end.

01:25:17
<transcript>: i think

01:25:28
<transcript>: I think to make it a state machine. I think it'll be a simple state machine. But that's good, right? That's better than a complicated one. Okay, we're gonna go back the little dog pictures where we're learning about X state.

01:25:40
<transcript>: Okay. So there's events. It's unclear to me how I omit events yet, but I'm sure that'll be very clear soon.

01:25:48
<transcript>: Terministic means that each transition, an event, always points the same next state always reduces the same results, and they're giving okay, that makes sense.

01:25:48
<transcript>: initial

01:25:54
<transcript>: Initial state. Okay. All that makes sense. I think. I think I just need to look more at examples.

01:25:54
<transcript>: compound state

01:25:55
barneyoftherubble: cowfacedude99 I don't like you swearing at me

01:25:55
<transcript>: Compound state.

01:25:55
<transcript>: that

01:25:59
<transcript>: That can contain more States. Also known as Child States.

01:26:06
cowfacedude99: sorry

01:26:08
<transcript>: The estates can only happen when the parent compound state is happening inside the Arnold Walk state. There could be child States of walking, running and stopping. Snippet smells okay.

01:26:16
<transcript>: So we could have, like, an ipad that's outside of this compound state. And then like an active game state. Right. Something like that.

01:26:20
<transcript>: We could do that.

01:26:30
<transcript>: Okay atomic state state that doesn't have any child States okay fine parallel state.

01:26:37
<transcript>: Okay.

01:26:44
<transcript>: Self transition within an event happens with the transition returns to the same state. Transition arrow exits and reentries the same state.

01:26:44
<transcript>: okay

01:26:46
<transcript>: Okay.

01:26:53
<transcript>: Hopefully to describe a self transition is doing something, not going somewhere.

01:26:59
<transcript>: Okay. In the process. Darbying. Process. Okay. Planning state charts.

01:27:09
<transcript>: All right. I think I, oh, delayed transition. Here we go. I'm gonna have some of these. We're gonna have some timers, some login and logout processes. Log out and inactive user.

01:27:14
<transcript>: So login.

01:27:14
cowfacedude99: the vim vs nvim debate kind of takes it out for me LUL

01:27:16
<transcript>: Your active idle.

01:27:25
<transcript>: After three minutes. Okay. So we can have some delayed transitions. Let's look at some examples.

01:27:30
<transcript>: Recipes.

01:27:41
<transcript>: Do. I don't need context. I'm not gonna use context.

01:27:44
barneyoftherubble: its like *nix vs WSL really

01:27:46
<transcript>: So yeah, I'm getting Redux vibes with the like actions.

01:27:53
<transcript>: Being all capital, all that stuff. This isn't gonna feel like Redux. Is it because I don't really enjoy using Redux.

01:28:04
<transcript>: I was looking for a pattern. Wait, what's the difference in patterns, examples and recipes and tutorials.

01:28:06
cowfacedude99: because I think both are very nice but there are some choices that bram made that I don't like personally.

01:28:10
<transcript>: So just the knit of mine for the xDate folks.

01:28:10
<transcript>: it's not

01:28:11
<transcript>: It's not clear to me.

01:28:12
barneyoftherubble: a delayed log out of a dog? WeirdChamp

01:28:20
<transcript>: Let's use guides, tutorials, recipes, patterns, or examples. If I want to look at I guess examples would be actual code.

01:28:20
<transcript>: also

01:28:22
<transcript>: Also a tutorials.

01:28:22
<transcript>: and recipes

01:28:24
<transcript>: And recipes. I don't know.

01:28:30
<transcript>: Patterns. Examples. Those all feel like synonyms. Sort of to me.

01:28:34
<transcript>: I guess they're not. I guess they're different.

01:28:34
<transcript>: guides

01:28:35
<transcript>: Guides for.

01:28:44
<transcript>: Let's see to do MVC examples. I just need to see some more like syntax. Like what are these so on event.

01:28:44
<transcript>: how do you emit

01:28:48
<transcript>: How do you emit? Okay, so here's how you emit the event. So you haven't done.

01:28:49
instafluff: different "states" of the same thing...? sofieThink

01:28:50
<transcript>: This react.

01:28:50
kultiviert: is it already Movember? Keepo

01:28:54
<transcript>: No, this is not react, but.

01:28:54
<transcript>: there's gonna be

01:28:58
<transcript>: There's gonna be some way for me to create this service thing.

01:29:05
<transcript>: And then I send events to the server. Okay, cool. I think I know enough. I think I know enough now.

01:29:12
<transcript>: Let's see. Thank you for the follow Gaby.

01:29:12
<transcript>: appreciate your

01:29:14
<transcript>: Appreciate your follow.

01:29:19
<transcript>: Different States of the same thing.

01:29:19
<transcript>: i

01:29:22
<transcript>: I'm delayed log out of a dot.

01:29:26
<transcript>: November.

01:29:26
<transcript>: i've just always

01:29:30
<transcript>: I've just always got a beard fully worth. I will never shave.

01:29:30
<transcript>: not november

01:29:33
<transcript>: Not November, or any other month.

01:29:39
<transcript>: Okay. Let's look at.

01:29:49
<transcript>: Let's do some react. I just kind of want to have the react docs available.

01:29:51
wesleycoder: look into useMachine if you want to understand how react will use state machines and send events

01:29:54
<transcript>: Okay, here we go. To do NVC with react.

01:29:54
<transcript>: is react

01:29:56
<transcript>: Is react with hooks.

01:30:01
<transcript>: Cool. Where is this? Where does it live? Can I look at it.

01:30:06
<transcript>: There's, it deployed. Where's the code.

01:30:10
<transcript>: Anyone know where the code is.

01:30:13
2dorkstv: howdy, friends o/

01:30:16
<transcript>: Anyone? Bueller. Where is it.

01:30:16
<transcript>: code

01:30:17
<transcript>: Code.

01:30:22
<transcript>: Open sandbox. Oh, it's a sandbox. So that's where the code is.

01:30:22
<transcript>: hey

01:30:26
<transcript>: Hey, two dorks is here. How's it going? Two dorks.

01:30:33
<transcript>: Thank you, Wesley. Coder.

01:30:33
<transcript>: i just need to

01:30:35
<transcript>: I just need to look at use machine.

01:30:39
caasidev: hey up

01:30:39
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:30:47
<transcript>: To do's machine. So they're putting them in, like, a separate files. I'm not gonna do that. It's all gonna be in one.

01:30:52
<transcript>: File. But this is nice. This is helpful. I'm gonna copy this.

01:30:53
2dorkstv: doing well! Last day of a work hackathon. Lots to do! 0_o

01:30:54
<transcript>: All of this. Okay.

01:30:54
<transcript>: we did it

01:31:00
<transcript>: We did it. We found somewhere we could just copy and paste some stuff. I showed as I'm not playing music.

01:31:02
<transcript>: What am I thinking.

01:31:04
<transcript>: Not playing music.

01:31:10
<transcript>: Play some music here we go.

01:31:10
<transcript>: now it's getting serious

01:31:12
<transcript>: Now it's getting serious.

01:31:16
<transcript>: Set interval.

01:31:19
stroopwafel26: @2DorksTV what are you building?

01:31:23
instafluff: copy paste best solution!

01:31:24
<transcript>: Okay. So we're gonna do it. Not in the round. I think we're gonna do it at the top here. We're gonna start at home.

01:31:26
<transcript>: Let's.

01:31:26
<transcript>: paste it

01:31:28
<transcript>: Paste it all right, here.

01:31:33
<transcript>: That's probably isn't TypeScript. No, it is.

01:31:33
<transcript>: no it isn't

01:31:35
<transcript>: No, it isn't.

01:31:37
<transcript>: I don't know.

01:31:37
<transcript>: i'm not

01:31:43
<transcript>: I'm not having installed xDate. That's an important next step. Are we using pnpm.

01:31:47
<transcript>: Add.

01:31:47
<transcript>: xta

01:31:52
<transcript>: Xtate? Oh? Do I need to add like, X state react and all that.

01:31:57
<transcript>: State react.

01:31:58
2dorkstv: @stroopwafel26 building a RPG inspired task list. The catch is someone else makes your task list and sets your rewards. Like an accountability buddy

01:32:06
<transcript>: Do I need to add X state as well? Yeah. Okay.

01:32:08
<transcript>: X eight.

01:32:10
<transcript>: And.

01:32:12
<transcript>: X.

01:32:12
<transcript>: eight

01:32:15
<transcript>: Eight, react.

01:32:16
stroopwafel26: @2DorksTV cool! i'd love to see it

01:32:20
wesleycoder: t3ggStack

01:32:23
<transcript>: Instafluff agrees. Copy paste is always best.

01:32:32
<transcript>: A work hackathon. Oh, what are you building? Two, dorks I'm also curious.

01:32:34
<transcript>: Hi, Cassie.

01:32:38
<transcript>: Cassie Dev is here as well.

01:32:50
<transcript>: Okay.

01:32:51
sulleythecat: omg those fonts

01:32:55
sulleythecat: this guy is a madman

01:33:03
<transcript>: What is the syntax here we're doing create machine.

01:33:04
caasidev: yes admiring your neovim config ;-)

01:33:17
wesleycoder: careful when eating your mustache may get dirty

01:33:20
<transcript>: Great machine.

01:33:20
<transcript>: id

01:33:22
<transcript>: Id.

01:33:32
<transcript>: Oh.

01:33:36
<transcript>: So context.

01:33:38
sulleythecat: typescript?

01:33:42
<transcript>: We need to define context, and probably it's like a generic thing we need to do.

01:33:45
<transcript>: Right.

01:33:49
<transcript>: So Let's.

01:33:49
<transcript>: say

01:33:49
<transcript>: Say.

01:33:52
<transcript>: Type context.

01:33:58
lekboks_kingyt: Hello i am back😁

01:34:06
<transcript>: Something like this we'll get there, we'll add more to that. But if I create game machine now don't you say.

01:34:06
<transcript>: contact

01:34:08
<transcript>: Contacts like that.

01:34:10
<transcript>: Is a guess.

01:34:10
<transcript>: yeah okay

01:34:12
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

01:34:15
<transcript>: There's no ID.

01:34:18
theprimeagen: dang up early, crushing

01:34:27
<transcript>: So I guess what is.

01:34:27
<transcript>: when is

01:34:28
stroopwafel26: it's prime!

01:34:30
<transcript>: When is create game machine called.

01:34:35
<transcript>: Is. This. Is this react. I copied React code. Right.

01:34:35
<transcript>: okay

01:34:36
stroopwafel26: hey @ThePrimeagen

01:34:41
<transcript>: Okay, they're just exporting this and then they're using it. Wait a minute. There's just a dues machine.

01:34:49
<transcript>: Okay. I could just do that. I could just have the machine. I don't have to do, like, make a function that creates a machine. Yeah, Yeah.

01:34:49
<transcript>: yeah

01:34:50
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:34:55
<transcript>: Game machine. I don't know what this this is about. I didn't want this.

01:34:56
theprimeagen: yayayaya

01:34:57
<transcript>: Never wanted it.

01:34:59
theprimeagen: howdy

01:35:02
<transcript>: Okay.

01:35:06
<transcript>: So contacts is going to have like round.

01:35:06
<transcript>: and

01:35:07
<transcript>: And.

01:35:15
cowfacedude99: primeagenHeyy

01:35:16
<transcript>: Initial idol on.

01:35:19
<transcript>: Let's what's going on here.

01:35:24
wesleycoder: context is where you hold values that change independently of states. kinda like a Redux store

01:35:27
<transcript>: Come down for one thing. We need to delete that.

01:35:30
<transcript>: Right.

01:35:32
<transcript>: Maybe not.

01:35:35
<transcript>: When we deleted the function.

01:35:39
stroopwafel26: primeagenSlider

01:35:45
<transcript>: Create machine. I guess I should just copy this one. Let's just copy this one.

01:35:47
<transcript>: It's more what we're trying to do.

01:35:49
<transcript>: Did I go too far.

01:35:53
<transcript>: Yeah, that's it. Okay.

01:36:05
barneyoftherubble: primeagenShame

01:36:13
<transcript>: So.

01:36:19
barneyoftherubble: Definetely needs to be an emote theprimeagen

01:36:29
<transcript>: Context.

01:36:33
<transcript>: Preserve Action order. I don't know yet.

01:36:37
<transcript>: That's gonna be round.

01:36:42
<transcript>: Initial round will not exist. I guess it should be optional.

01:36:51
<transcript>: Both of those are just okay. Initial.

01:36:51
<transcript>: id

01:36:53
<transcript>: Idle.

01:36:54
<transcript>: Eight.

01:36:54
<transcript>: okay so here's

01:36:58
<transcript>: Okay. So here's where you're changing the context.

01:37:00
<transcript>: Right.

01:37:11
<transcript>: Context where you hold values that change independently of States. Kind of like a Redux store. Yeah, that's what I kind of. I was getting Redux store. Fields.

01:37:14
<transcript>: The Prime Minister.

01:37:28
<transcript>: Prime, we're working on some stuff we're working on. Aw. Guess, prime. It's like a guessing game that's all broken. Now you see an AWS service icon, and you have to choose which a device services. It.

01:37:28
theprimeagen: it looks beautiful

01:37:33
<transcript>: 's Also, Am I missing here.

01:37:35
<transcript>: It looks beautiful. Yeah.

01:37:39
<transcript>: The blue background the blue background did it for you.

01:37:41
elsuxo: primeagenClap1 primeagenEmacs primeagenClap2

01:37:48
stroopwafel26: the desig is very minimal

01:37:50
<transcript>: So we're trying to use X state manage the game state, but I don't know if state so I'm learning.

01:37:50
<transcript>: all of it

01:37:52
<transcript>: All of it.

01:38:04
<transcript>: Somebody explained to me.

01:38:09
<transcript>: These are on events. So these are all the events, names and caps.

01:38:09
<transcript>: as yeah

01:38:13
<transcript>: As yeah it has a lot of Redux feelings that I don't love.

01:38:25
<transcript>: But I guess the thing I didn't love about Redux was like having all these things spread across, like five different files. I guess if it's one place where I have all this stuff, this state management stuff, it's less bad to me.

01:38:36
<transcript>: Okay, so States, we're gonna have idol.

01:38:39
<transcript>: Entry. What is the sign? Do.

01:38:46
<transcript>: Always ready. There's so many things that don't make sense to me.

01:38:46
<transcript>: always

01:38:52
<transcript>: Always ready. So always go to ready? Is that what that means? And this is the only other state is ready.

01:38:57
<transcript>: Okay.

01:39:01
<transcript>: All right, Andrew bird.

01:39:04
<transcript>: Not doing it for me.

01:39:13
<transcript>: Anyone know what entry assign would be.

01:39:13
<transcript>: just assign

01:39:19
<transcript>: Just assign. Is that just changing the state? That's just updating our context? Yeah. To do.

01:39:22
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:39:26
<transcript>: What's to do.

01:39:30
<transcript>: But the key inside of context, right? Am I getting that right? At least.

01:39:35
<transcript>: I could say, like when we enter into.

01:39:35
<transcript>: this won't be for

01:39:37
<transcript>: This won't be for idle it'll be.

01:39:41
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:39:43
wesleycoder: entry is what happens when entering this state

01:39:44
<transcript>: If we were to enter into the state.

01:39:48
<transcript>: What was after Idol? We started visualizing this, didn't we.

01:39:55
<transcript>: I idle active. Expired. Correct. So if we said we enter into active.

01:39:57
<transcript>: Entry.

01:39:59
<transcript>: We could assign.

01:40:01
<transcript>: This.

01:40:05
<transcript>: Round is going to be new round.

01:40:07
<transcript>: Let's think about this.

01:40:07
<transcript>: because

01:40:12
<transcript>: Because that's going to involve server trips, right.

01:40:14
<transcript>: Let's think about this.

01:40:19
<transcript>: Just one step to compile it bothers me when step doesn't compile.

01:40:27
<transcript>: Enter individual mode.

01:40:29
theprimeagen: love the song

01:40:37
<transcript>: See these. I want to just comment all that out.

01:40:46
<transcript>: Okay. Now at least we're just working with the state, so we don't have all these events.

01:41:09
<transcript>: Entries. What happens when entering this state? Yeah, that made sense to me. That was sort of intuitive, I guess. And then.

01:41:09
<transcript>: the sign

01:41:11
<transcript>: The sign is just updating right.

01:41:15
<transcript>: Assigned just updates the.

01:41:15
<transcript>: state

01:41:18
<transcript>: State. Is that accurate.

01:41:32
<transcript>: So if I wanted to do this, if I wanted to say we need to create a new game, what do we do down here? Handle new game. We call some like a sink stuff. Can I do that.

01:41:35
cowfacedude99: excalidraw time? maybe it would be better if we could visualize it first

01:41:38
<transcript>: And I just call new game and new round from within next eight I guess.

01:41:38
<transcript>: except

01:41:39
<transcript>: Except.

01:41:39
<transcript>: maybe

01:41:42
<transcript>: Maybe. Yeah. Maybe.

01:41:42
<transcript>: i don't know i

01:41:45
<transcript>: I don't know. I tried to visualize it in here. Did that help us.

01:41:49
<transcript>: I wrote out some state names.

01:41:49
<transcript>: let's pull it

01:41:51
<transcript>: Let's pull it. The Autograph. Maybe it'll inspire me.

01:41:54
wesleycoder: assign is just a helper to update context

01:42:00
<transcript>: Okay.

01:42:08
<transcript>: So.

01:42:08
<transcript>: we draw

01:42:11
<transcript>: We draw. Actually, I did this one time, didn't I.

01:42:19
<transcript>: Never name stuff. Yeah. Here's a Tob guess. So here's what the game looks like. Modeled a little bit.

01:42:25
<transcript>: Yeah. What do you think? Coffee. You think it'd be helpful to see.

01:42:33
<transcript>: See what, see what drawn out that state machine you mean? And in which case maybe we should use stately.

01:42:39
wesleycoder: entry accepts a function assign constructs that function for you

01:42:41
<transcript>: I think I just need to start putting code in there and see what it does. That's what my brain needs to do.

01:42:41
<transcript>: so like

01:42:44
<transcript>: So like this whole handle new game function.

01:42:49
<transcript>: Think if I just copy all this.

01:42:54
theprimeagen: yeah cowface

01:42:56
<transcript>: Go up here and paste it. I'll feel good knowing I can or can't do that.

01:43:02
theprimeagen: you tell them

01:43:09
<transcript>: Like, can I hear active? So we go into active. We need a new round. Whenever you go into active, that's what active means means, give me a new round. So we're gonna assign. Oh, but this. So this is a sign thing. That's the question.

01:43:11
<transcript>: What is this.

01:43:20
<transcript>: I don't know that I can do a sink stuff in here or that I should do it stuff and stay machine.

01:43:22
theprimeagen: just put code in there

01:43:23
barneyoftherubble: theprimeagen when are you going to make a tmux course?

01:43:27
<transcript>: No, yeah, it's a function. So, like, Round here, I can say.

01:43:29
<transcript>: Contact.

01:43:34
<transcript>: Putting the contacts. And this could be an async function. Right.

01:43:36
<transcript>: Maybe.

01:43:37
theprimeagen: tmux? bash bunni has the whole thing covered!

01:43:45
<transcript>: Async method. Oh, it's just unexpected. So then if I said return.

01:43:48
<transcript>: That works.

01:43:54
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. I think I can do this. I think I actually. I think I can do this.

01:43:58
<transcript>: Maybe.

01:44:01
<transcript>: New Go, but that's a new table.

01:44:05
<transcript>: I don't think I can do this.

01:44:13
<transcript>: I guess the event. So is this how you would do it? You'd have an event like start.

01:44:13
<transcript>: in the start

01:44:18
<transcript>: In the start event would have the round on it like as I said, Payload, is that what you do.

01:44:20
<transcript>: Just put code in there.

01:44:27
cowfacedude99: the visualization thing is something I picked up from altf4 bg

01:44:29
<transcript>: I watched Bash Bunny's, Team X video.

01:44:33
<transcript>: Visualization thing is something I picked up from alt F, four.

01:44:36
cowfacedude99: it comes as a habit.

01:44:38
<transcript>: You're saying visualize the state machine in here.

01:44:47
<transcript>: I do like going into Excel Draw and just start drawing stuff when I'm in that state of mind. Not right now. I just don't feel like I know enough to start drawing stuff.

01:44:58
<transcript>: I think it's I think it's that I need to do an event called Start that moves us into active, from idle to active, right.

01:45:00
wesleycoder: yep, you could model a loading nested state

01:45:05
<transcript>: So idle always goes into so here this always goes into the active state.

01:45:08
<transcript>: All of this.

01:45:13
<transcript>: And just go away, right.

01:45:19
<transcript>: No. Did I get rid of the.

01:45:19
<transcript>: active

01:45:21
<transcript>: Active too. Yeah, I did.

01:45:24
<transcript>: All this.

01:45:28
<transcript>: Title.

01:45:32
<transcript>: Andrew Bird? Yeah, I've got to take Andrew Bird out of this.

01:45:32
<transcript>: he's not doing it

01:45:37
<transcript>: He's not doing it. He's just too late. Low energy. I'm gonna have low energy. I wanted to be all day.

01:45:37
<transcript>: i'll

01:45:41
<transcript>: I'll take him below energy all day I don't care.

01:45:46
theprimeagen: low energy andrew

01:46:04
<transcript>: So I think I think I need to do an event.

01:46:04
<transcript>: that's

01:46:09
<transcript>: That's called Start. Well, here's our on. Let's just start doing this on.

01:46:11
<transcript>: Start.

01:46:14
<transcript>: This is when you start the game, right.

01:46:17
<transcript>: Actions.

01:46:23
<transcript>: Actions is an array.

01:46:25
<transcript>: In some cases.

01:46:33
<transcript>: Actions. This is an array of assignments.

01:46:35
<transcript>: No. And then there's a condition.

01:46:37
<transcript>: Of these.

01:46:40
<transcript>: This reminds me of the Regex thing. Like.

01:46:40
<transcript>: you have a problem

01:46:46
<transcript>: You have a problem, and then you use regex and I have two problems. I had a problem, and I was like, let's use X state.

01:46:48
<transcript>: Now we have two problems.

01:46:48
<transcript>: we have a lot

01:46:51
<transcript>: We have a lot more than two problems.

01:46:56
<transcript>: Low energy Andrew. That's right. Yep. You could make.

01:46:56
<transcript>: it could model

01:46:59
<transcript>: It could model a Loading nested state that sounds so hard.

01:47:09
<transcript>: What do we think, Chat? I'm not against.

01:47:09
<transcript>: this

01:47:11
<transcript>: This abandoning.

01:47:11
<transcript>: and just some

01:47:14
<transcript>: And just some costing it and saying X eight was not necessary.

01:47:18
stiefbroerikzitvast: im against

01:47:21
<transcript>: It's just started to feel like we have expirations. We have, like, all this stuff going on.

01:47:21
<transcript>: i don't know

01:47:22
<transcript>: I don't know.

01:47:22
<transcript>: felt

01:47:29
<transcript>: Felt like maybe we did need a state machine, but it's feeling less and less. The more I look at ext.

01:47:30
<transcript>: exto

01:47:30
<transcript>: extoke like a

01:47:32
<transcript>: Extoke like a fire, Yes.

01:47:35
<transcript>: What is this.

01:47:35
<transcript>: what is this

01:47:36
<transcript>: What is this.

01:47:42
stiefbroerikzitvast: the font is unreadable

01:47:46
<transcript>: No data brew. Let's just do the scoring stuff. I want to work on the scoring stuff. I keep saying we're gonna get to it.

01:47:46
<transcript>: and then i

01:47:49
<transcript>: And then I don't we're gonna put a pin.

01:47:49
<transcript>: we're gonna put

01:47:51
<transcript>: We're gonna put a pin in it.

01:47:51
<transcript>: in the x

01:47:59
<transcript>: In the xDate stuff, we're gonna go to our game router and let's talk about what, how do we score this? Because it's gonna be fun to actually just make it up as we go.

01:48:02
<transcript>: I'm gonna need the schema.

01:48:08
<transcript>: This one so around so we already did put score on here.

01:48:08
wesleycoder: git stash that

01:48:13
<transcript>: So let's see.

01:48:13
<transcript>: when

01:48:15
<transcript>: When you answer.

01:48:20
<transcript>: Where is that mutation? Answer. Here we go.

01:48:22
<transcript>: When you answer.

01:48:25
<transcript>: Pass a round ID and a choice.

01:48:25
<transcript>: and you either

01:48:28
<transcript>: And you either get it correct or incorrect and it could be expired.

01:48:28
<transcript>: so you could

01:48:48
<transcript>: So you could get it correct. But you after the buzzer. And we wanted to have that tracked here. But now we need to kind of calculate, like, your score for the game, right? Or what did this do? Getting this answer? What did it do for your score? We might want to say, if you answer it really fast, you get like, a bonus. Or if you're on a streak, you get a bonus, like if you've got five in a row.

01:48:48
<transcript>: start counting

01:48:53
<transcript>: Start counting. Is two or something. This is. This is more fun than xDate.

01:49:04
<transcript>: This is the excaladra font actually. Step row, get stash that Wesley codour. That's a good idea, except I think I have a lot of other changes.

01:49:07
<transcript>: In my good history right now.

01:49:11
<transcript>: Maybe not a lot, but I have some.

01:49:16
<transcript>: I mean everything's in that index TSX space, basically.

01:49:20
stiefbroerikzitvast: is this a Battle Royale game?

01:49:21
<transcript>: We're just going to end up deleting all that if I decide I don't want it anymore.

01:49:23
<transcript>: Okay.

01:49:23
<transcript>: so

01:49:23
stroopwafel26: @adamdotdev doesn't commit often, but when he does...

01:49:28
<transcript>: So how do we want to say how do we want to say the score changed.

01:49:31
<transcript>: Score Delta.

01:49:34
<transcript>: Okay. And then we're gonna have to update.

01:49:37
<transcript>: We're gonna update the.

01:49:37
<transcript>: game

01:49:38
<transcript>: Game score.

01:49:43
<transcript>: Which I guess it feels bad a little bit to do that.

01:49:47
<transcript>: To do that, like synchronously.

01:49:51
<transcript>: In this resolve this mutation Resolver.

01:49:53
<transcript>: Doesn't it? Does it feel bad.

01:49:58
<transcript>: Like before they get back whether they were correct or not, we had to update.

01:49:58
<transcript>: the game

01:50:00
<transcript>: The game.

01:50:02
<transcript>: Should we do that like I.

01:50:15
<transcript>: Even a way to do, like asynchronous outoband stuff with the stack. Anyone know? Like, could I fire off? Like normally an AWS land. I would like I could cue something.

01:50:15
<transcript>: and then

01:50:19
theprimeagen: i love how complicated ui has become

01:50:20
<transcript>: And then I could, like, pick up those events, an update state in a database or whatever.

01:50:20
<transcript>: i don't know

01:50:21
theprimeagen: its beautiful

01:50:24
<transcript>: I don't know if I can do that with the TRPC stack.

01:50:43
<transcript>: Yeah prime. I every time I work on the front end, I hated a little bit more after like ten years of having to build front ends. I just I can't keep up. I feel like I should use react because there's no information out there about react, and it just seems like if I'm gonna build, I might as well build with what most people build with. But.

01:50:43
<transcript>: i just don't

01:50:54
theprimeagen: Frontend Masters doesn't use a UI framework and they are BY far the fastest site i have used in a decade

01:50:55
<transcript>: I just don't it doesn't click with me. I've been writing hooks for however many years hooks have been out, and I still I still don't get it. I mean, I get it, but I still just feels like so much so much work.

01:51:00
<transcript>: Don't commit often, but when he does.

01:51:20
<transcript>: Battle Royale. So separately, it is gonna be multiplayer because I definitely want to compete with Step row on. Aws, that's gonna be a thing. We talked about using replicas for the multiplayer stuff. And then I don't know. Dax made me feel like maybe we shouldn't. Front of Masters doesn't use a UI framework, and they are by far the fastest side I've used in a decade. That.

01:51:20
<transcript>: 's interesting

01:51:28
<transcript>: 's Interesting Prime. I know. There's people, there's people I know. Well, I just said, DAX, DAX doesn't use react, and he builds really fast stuff.

01:51:31
<transcript>: He uses like solid JS.

01:51:31
<transcript>: which i think

01:51:33
<transcript>: Which I think is much more minimal.

01:51:39
<transcript>: Yes. So maybe that's the trick. Maybe I just shouldn't be building with all these.

01:51:43
<transcript>: Frameworks Spa frameworks that's problem.

01:51:47
<transcript>: Like when you say they don't use the framework.

01:51:47
<transcript>: or they don't

01:51:50
<transcript>: Or they don't use yeah, UA UI framework. They just like.

01:51:50
<transcript>: is it all just

01:51:52
<transcript>: Is it all just.

01:51:52
<transcript>: event handlers

01:51:54
<transcript>: Event handlers vanilla JavaScript.

01:51:56
<transcript>: They use.

01:51:56
<transcript>: jquery

01:51:57
2dorkstv: dipping my toes into react for the first time and I'm definitely hitting lots of walls to break though

01:51:58
theprimeagen: raw doggin vanilla

01:52:01
<transcript>: Jquery or something. I don't know. What are people that don't use a framework? Use.

01:52:01
<transcript>: raw dog

01:52:03
<transcript>: Raw dog and vanilla. Okay.

01:52:09
<transcript>: Dipping my toes into react for the first time. Definitely hitting lots of walls, break through it's a lot.

01:52:13
<transcript>: It's a lot to take in all at once.

01:52:16
theprimeagen: i think the thing is you have to choose your stack, and become an expert to become effective

01:52:23
<transcript>: Okay, but we're pretty committed at this point. We're committed to react.

01:52:24
instafluff: vanilla js, the new asm instafThink

01:52:28
<transcript>: We're trying out the T three stacks. I don't think I could build that.

01:52:28
<transcript>: on the

01:52:29
theprimeagen: i am starting to see the hurdle to get into frontend no different than getting into rust

01:52:30
2dorkstv: back in my day, we built sites with raw HTML on angelfire! *shakes fist*

01:52:31
<transcript>: On the TV preset without react score Delta.

01:52:42
<transcript>: Zero. We're just gonna do it in line right now. We're just gonna update the database, the game record, like right here, even though it feels kind of bad.

01:52:47
<transcript>: Game equals context? Prisma.

01:52:47
<transcript>: game

01:52:48
<transcript>: Game.

01:52:48
<transcript>: what do we

01:52:50
<transcript>: What do we want? Find first.

01:52:53
<transcript>: Or find unique.

01:52:56
<transcript>: Find unique.

01:53:00
<transcript>: And then what I do? Where.

01:53:02
<transcript>: All this stuff.

01:53:04
<transcript>: Where.

01:53:04
caasidev: what font size do u use in vim?

01:53:09
<transcript>: Id. Can I just do that? Yeah. Id.

01:53:09
<transcript>: do i

01:53:11
stroopwafel26: @2DorksTV I still build my own site using html and css, nothing else, it's pretty fast MaxLOL

01:53:14
<transcript>: Do I just put in a value here? Do I have to do some other weird syntax, like equals or something.

01:53:18
<transcript>: Anyone know I can just say where I do I did this somewhere did I.

01:53:20
<transcript>: Game ID. Okay.

01:53:20
<transcript>: i have the

01:53:24
<transcript>: I have the game ID right now. I don't have the game ID.

01:53:28
<transcript>: To be Round Game ID. Yeah, okay.

01:53:33
2dorkstv: right on , @stroopwafel26 . I use Hugo for my blog. it's kinda fun to manage everything out of a git repo

01:53:37
<transcript>: So that's our game and we're gonna say we want to update it. I guess I don't have to find it. I can just update it. That's the thing you can do in sequel.

01:53:37
<transcript>: i'm so used

01:53:45
<transcript>: I'm so used to like not working with SQL Databases. Now that no, all this feels weird. Update.

01:53:48
<transcript>: So.

01:53:48
<transcript>: where

01:53:49
<transcript>: Where that.

01:53:52
<transcript>: 's wrong.

01:53:52
stroopwafel26: it is, love just pushing to main and that's that

01:54:04
<transcript>: As I will parameterize select. Oh, I've got to include something else. What the thing I'm gonna update, right.

01:54:04
<transcript>: so where's

01:54:05
im_noxz: its missing the data prop

01:54:17
<transcript>: So Where's required data is the other key? Is that what anyone else see these? And just like your brain just stops. You see this huge wall of text for like an error like this. And you just you don't even know what to think.

01:54:17
<transcript>: data

01:54:19
<transcript>: Data.

01:54:23
<transcript>: I'm gonna update data and I get that can have like options.

01:54:25
<transcript>: In it.

01:54:25
<transcript>: like

01:54:27
theprimeagen: typescript errors become c++ errors change my mind

01:54:28
ziko008: good day, I'm having some hard times learning useReducer and React in general, I guess I skipped some important steps cause I've watched many Devs saying to learn VueJs first since it's easier, what do you think? thank you

01:54:31
<transcript>: Like it's a partial in TypeScript. Kind of like I can specify whatever I want, anyone know.

01:54:31
<transcript>: find out

01:54:32
<transcript>: Find out.

01:54:38
<transcript>: Data. We're updating the score. Yeah. Okay. Optional score.

01:54:38
<transcript>: to

01:54:41
<transcript>: To be oh, how do I increment it.

01:54:43
<transcript>: Prisma.

01:54:46
<transcript>: Increment. Number.

01:54:46
<transcript>: on a date

01:54:49
<transcript>: On a date or something.

01:54:54
<transcript>: Not possible directly.

01:55:07
<transcript>: Need to use prison execute raw. Oh, I'd have to just like, update some. I'd have to write my own sequel. Oh, it's supported. Okay.

01:55:11
<transcript>: Increment.

01:55:16
<transcript>: Okay. Cool. So I just say score.

01:55:16
<transcript>: increment

01:55:17
<transcript>: Increment.

01:55:19
<transcript>: Oh no no.

01:55:23
<transcript>: For It. Increment.

01:55:23
<transcript>: and

01:55:25
<transcript>: And then score Delta, right.

01:55:28
<transcript>: All this good.

01:55:31
<transcript>: And I don't know.

01:55:34
whoa_dood: how has your experience with t3 stack been? I just wrapped my head around making tRPC API's, seems simple and quick DX for me.

01:55:34
<transcript>: That.

01:55:34
<transcript>: right

01:55:37
<transcript>: Right. Okay.

01:55:41
<transcript>: We return correct answer and expired.

01:55:41
<transcript>: welcome to chat

01:55:42
<transcript>: Welcome to chat.

01:55:42
<transcript>: whoa dude

01:55:56
<transcript>: Whoa, dude, how was your experience with T Three stock bin? I just wrapped my head around making TRPC APIs seems simple and quick. Dx. Yeah, I liked your PC. I do like to your PC. That's the thing that mostly new to me. I mean, some of this other stuff, Prisma is new, but yeah, T three.

01:55:56
<transcript>: it's been good for me

01:55:58
<transcript>: It's been good for me.

01:56:04
<transcript>: Good tip or react except for the front end. As we just discussed, I don't enjoy building frontends.

01:56:06
itsboek: Why am I up so early? At least I have you

01:56:10
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. I'm Knox, as well.

01:56:15
<transcript>: Don't miss anybody else That's new.

01:56:20
<transcript>: Built sites with raw HTML on angel fire.

01:56:33
<transcript>: Stack become an expert to become effective. Yeah, see, I. But the problem with that Prime, I feel like I've chosen react.

01:56:33
<transcript>: just like

01:56:37
<transcript>: Just like seven years ago, eight years ago, when I was building statues.

01:56:37
<transcript>: we just chose

01:56:40
akawr: akawrWave

01:56:48
<transcript>: We just chose it. We said React. It seems like the new cool thing we're using React and I've not used any other frontend stuff for like eight years, and for some reason it still just doesn't click for me. Maybe I'm just not ready.

01:57:04
<transcript>: I'm trying to think of anything has clicked, like on the back end. I don't know. I don't write. It feels like I never write back in seven because I spend all my time building this front end. I spend like 30 minutes writing an API and then.

01:57:04
<transcript>: twelve hours

01:57:07
<transcript>: 12 hours building a front end for it like just building a form.

01:57:11
<transcript>: Vanilla JS the new.

01:57:11
<transcript>: as

01:57:12
<transcript>: Asm.

01:57:14
<transcript>: What's ASM.

01:57:18
<transcript>: asmassy dev

01:57:18
<transcript>: asmassy dev what font

01:57:21
<transcript>: Asmassy Dev. What font size do I use in Vin? I don't know, actually.

01:57:21
<transcript>: i don't

01:57:23
wesleycoder: maybe you are good and react is just bad

01:57:24
<transcript>: I don't know we could find out.

01:57:30
<transcript>: There is a transparent cowboy hat on my head that's disturbing.

01:57:34
<transcript>: What's my font size.

01:57:36
caasidev: found your dotfiles now thanks

01:57:36
<transcript>: It would be in this thing, right.

01:57:37
itsboek: React was just a ploy from big front end to stay employed

01:57:43
<transcript>: Config. I guess it'd be alacrity.

01:57:46
<transcript>: Yes.

01:57:46
instafluff: ah, i meant "asm" like assembly! sorry sofieRIP

01:57:54
<transcript>: Font size 22. There you go. 22. Somethings. Whatever. 22 is 22 pixels, I guess.

01:57:59
<transcript>: I still build your own site with HTML and CSS, nothing else.

01:57:59
<transcript>: that's impressive

01:58:01
<transcript>: That's impressive.

01:58:05
stroopwafel26: 22px is large wow

01:58:11
<transcript>: So I'm knocks welcome. It's Missing dataprop. Thank you. Welcome to chat. I love when people pop into chat for the first time, and they're just super helpful. Here's the thing you're stuck on.

01:58:22
instafluff: @wesleycoder yeah, i'm still not fully convinced on react!

01:58:23
<transcript>: Having hard times learning, use, reducer and react in general. I guess I skip some important steps because I'm watched Mini Devs saying to learn, view Jazz first since it's easier.

01:58:23
<transcript>: i don't know

01:58:26
<transcript>: I don't know I don't know if it's easier I've never played with you.

01:58:31
stroopwafel26: ok thursday library day again bye

01:58:33
<transcript>: I feel like the de facto answer is always just use react these days because it's what most people use.

01:58:33
<transcript>: but

01:58:34
instafluff: even though i have to use it for work

01:58:49
<transcript>: But you're not like the first person in the last two days that told me they're trying to learn full stack. They're going through something to learn it. And now they're at the part where they're trying to learn react and nothing is clicking and they felt like everything up to that point was doing pretty good. They were learning some JavaScript. I don't know.

01:58:56
<transcript>: Why are you up so early? Book a car's. Here.

01:58:59
<transcript>: A car Binja.

01:58:59
<transcript>: maybe

01:59:02
markmccullohdev: Vue is a delight to use

01:59:04
<transcript>: Maybe I'm good and react is bad. That's a good point, Wesley. It might be react. Fault.

01:59:08
<transcript>: Ploy for the big front end to save.

01:59:11
<transcript>: Oh, like assembly gotcha.

01:59:21
<transcript>: Okay. Mark McColla welcome. Mark Says viewer delight to use I know there's a lot of View fans out there.

01:59:26
<transcript>: See us. Droop.

01:59:32
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't know about react. I don't know whether I should recommend it to people.

01:59:33
yodavido: Vue is nice, Svelte is also another fun one to use. Qwik's technology is pretty slick and crazy how it works

01:59:34
<transcript>: I don't know.

01:59:34
<transcript>: i don't

01:59:37
<transcript>: I don't know if I should recommend it to myself.

01:59:37
<transcript>: i'm just feeling

01:59:38
<transcript>: I'm just feeling bad at it.

01:59:38
<transcript>: for delta

01:59:46
<transcript>: For Delta. Okay, so how do I calculate the score? Delta. You've got it right. That's one point. That'd be the simple way, right? We just say.

01:59:47
yodavido: also hey...

01:59:48
<transcript>: Correct.

01:59:52
<transcript>: Would you say.

01:59:56
<transcript>: Correct.

02:00:00
<transcript>: One else. Zero. Now would be one way right.

02:00:09
<transcript>: Andrew Bird, Where do you keep coming from? Did I put like a hundred and Bird songs on this playlist.

02:00:09
<transcript>: because it

02:00:13
<transcript>: Because it keeps popping up and this is a huge playlist. There's like 250 songs on it.

02:00:14
instafluff: yeah i recommend it to people on the job search, otherwise i don't know... LUL

02:00:17
<transcript>: Maybe it's my energy today. Maybe I just need to stay low energy.

02:00:21
<transcript>: Score Delta correct is one.

02:00:21
<transcript>: and

02:00:26
jenswoeste: feel like a boomer. for me .NET is the ultimate x-platform fullstack "framework".

02:00:28
<transcript>: And zero. That's not great, though, right? That doesn't do anything for us in terms of streaks.

02:00:28
<transcript>: in terms

02:00:33
<transcript>: In terms of how quickly so there's the amount of time it took you so expired.

02:00:33
<transcript>: let's see

02:00:34
wesleycoder: that's why I'm learning SolidJS, it tries to not get in your way and let you code like before react but with current tech like jsx and hooks like interface with a complete functional approach

02:00:35
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:00:43
<transcript>: Expires less than new date. So what we want to know is, what is the Delta between? Like, how fast did you answer it.

02:00:50
<transcript>: I believe we call that a lap on the front end. So elapsed.

02:00:50
<transcript>: elapse

02:00:50
instafluff: @JensWoeste true, .net is still nice!

02:00:52
<transcript>: Elapsed equals.

02:00:56
<transcript>: What.

02:00:56
<transcript>: now

02:00:58
<transcript>: Now, right now.

02:01:03
<transcript>: Equals New date.

02:01:05
<transcript>: And then.

02:01:10
<transcript>: That would be.

02:01:13
<transcript>: Now.

02:01:17
<transcript>: Elapse would be now.

02:01:17
<transcript>: minus start

02:01:18
<transcript>: Minus start right.

02:01:22
<transcript>: I think I have the start time here.

02:01:24
<transcript>: Now, I don't.

02:01:24
<transcript>: but i think

02:01:27
<transcript>: But I think there's a start time on round.

02:01:27
<transcript>: because

02:01:30
<transcript>: Because round isn't even tight. What.

02:01:37
<transcript>: Round has any because it doesn't have type notation.

02:01:37
<transcript>: is that just

02:01:38
instafluff: @wesleycoder interesting... i'll look into solidjs too, thank you!

02:01:42
<transcript>: Is that just when I added, when I just added, Start, did that do that.

02:01:45
<transcript>: What was the type of for.

02:01:51
yodavido: but yeah when building solo/side projects I always mess with other front-end libs/frameworks but as @Instafluff said when job searching react is the safest to know

02:01:51
<transcript>: Round or null.

02:01:55
<transcript>: Okay.

02:01:57
<transcript>: Here we go.

02:02:00
<transcript>: Start is a date.

02:02:06
<transcript>: What do we think.

02:02:11
<transcript>: Art.

02:02:17
tayloreddev: Ive inherited a Angular project pray for me WutFace

02:02:17
<transcript>: Following.

02:02:28
<transcript>: So, Wesley, that is number one on my list. Solo JS is definitely.

02:02:28
<transcript>: the thing i

02:02:32
<transcript>: The thing. I want to start learning. That's what DAX uses.

02:02:36
<transcript>: And it just seems a lot simpler.

02:02:38
<transcript>: And Ryan seems cool.

02:02:45
instafluff: @TayloredDev good luck sofieBless

02:02:50
<transcript>: Felt as another fun one to use Quick technologies. Pretty slick and crazy how it works. Yeah. All these things are so new that well, not no. Also new. I guess Quick is so new.

02:02:50
<transcript>: i spelt

02:02:59
<transcript>: I spelt. I don't know what to think about salt. It used to be on my list, and then just like solid seemed more fun to learn. Like I'd rather jump into that next. And they'll just keep getting pushed down.

02:03:04
<transcript>: Quick. Is it really on my radar yet? But I did see that they launched. Was it version one or something.

02:03:14
<transcript>: Full stack framework. So like ASP net yens. That's not you're, not a Boomer.

02:03:17
<transcript>: That's what like stack overflow is built on right.

02:03:17
<transcript>: i don't know

02:03:26
<transcript>: I don't know. Like 90% of people are riding like Java and T. Sharp. And no one talks about it like Twitter. You would think those technologies don't exist anymore.

02:03:31
theprimeagen: yes, java and c# is the most used lang

02:03:34
itsboek: Even just hearing about frontend frameworks makes my head hurt

02:03:35
theprimeagen: but go is reallllly making its way

02:03:43
theprimeagen: a huge portion of our code at netflix is moving towards go

02:03:45
<transcript>: Yeah, I feel like learning Solid would not be such a big leap because it is JSX that seems like I could transition into that and have less of the stuff I don't like about react. That's my guess.

02:03:57
<transcript>: I just don't know, like, I don't know whether to send people like people who are just getting into development and they're trying to learn they want to make this their career. I don't know if I should send those people.

02:04:06
tayloreddev: Im picking up go atm, like it so far

02:04:07
<transcript>: To something like solid. I've never played with it. And is it, like, too new or something? I don't know. That's why I just feel safe to be, like, just learn, react. There's a million react. Jobs.

02:04:13
<transcript>: It's the struggle of like, will they just get stuck and feel like it's their fault.

02:04:22
ajcwebdev: Send them to Astro

02:04:25
<transcript>: Just hearing about front and frameworks makes my head hurt.

02:04:30
wesleycoder: solid is react the way I wish it was

02:04:33
<transcript>: Go is really making it play. A huge portion of our code at Netflix is moving towards Go. Okay, good to know on the back end.

02:04:38
<transcript>: A company like Netflix, Prime. What do you guys use on the front end.

02:04:40
2dorkstv: we're headed to Go as well for almost everything

02:04:41
<transcript>: Like, what is Netflix? Do.

02:04:43
theprimeagen: depends

02:04:44
fredkisss: What don't you like about react ?

02:04:49
<transcript>: Send them to Astro agent.

02:04:49
fredkisss: Netflix uses react

02:04:52
theprimeagen: but react, native, or some weird form of react

02:04:54
yodavido: I agree on the GO. Our company has been moving our BE to Go

02:04:54
<transcript>: 's Here firsttime. Chat. Can't believe this is the first time I've seen you in Chat. I guess I've been streaming a little later.

02:04:54
<transcript>: so

02:05:01
<transcript>: So if you're from America, maybe that's why I'm just nesting you in chat. But I feel like I see you everywhere else on the internet.

02:05:01
akawr: i love how so many from netflix streams lol

02:05:05
<transcript>: Solid is reacts the way I wish it was.

02:05:06
2dorkstv: Kubernetes operators are all Go and that's kind of our jam

02:05:10
<transcript>: I'd like Go, I've written some stuff and go.

02:05:14
ajcwebdev: Finally awake lol

02:05:15
<transcript>: What don't you like about React Netflix Users react.

02:05:15
<transcript>: react

02:05:19
<transcript>: React react native are some weird form of react. Okay.

02:05:26
theprimeagen: yeah, mobile is all native

02:05:30
<transcript>: It's not that I don't like React. I just don't I don't feel like I'm doing it right after, like eight years of writing React code. I just still feel.

02:05:30
<transcript>: like i'm doing

02:05:31
<transcript>: Like I'm doing it wrong.

02:05:31
<transcript>: maybe

02:05:36
wesleycoder: I love react so much but I also hate react so much

02:05:40
theprimeagen: pro tip, everyone does it wrong, because there is no right

02:05:48
<transcript>: Maybe it's more like maybe it's less Reactful. Maybe it's more I just don't think, like a frontend developer, like when it comes to breaking up components and knowing how I should kind of structure things. I think that's where I struggle the most is like, I don't know, should this state live up here or should it be down in this component.

02:05:48
<transcript>: how

02:05:50
2dorkstv: @ThePrimeagen with the truth bombs :D

02:05:58
<transcript>: How should I interact between the two components and have state flow between them? Like that's the stuff that I feel like I just struggle with. Maybe that's not a react problem. Could just be a me problem.

02:05:59
wesleycoder: @theprimeagen exactly

02:06:02
<transcript>: But then I will say, like, use effect.

02:06:02
<transcript>: and some of the stuff

02:06:03
<transcript>: And some of the stuff.

02:06:03
<transcript>: that goes

02:06:05
<transcript>: That goes on.

02:06:05
<transcript>: with

02:06:10
<transcript>: With hooks still feels bad to me. I don't know. It just feels like a lot.

02:06:16
ajcwebdev: No one thinks like react some people just got really good at it through brute force

02:06:20
itsboek: That’s what I love about mobile so much. There’s only one-ish ways

02:06:23
jenswoeste: @ThePrimeagen on Rust. I would like to do an experiment to do some kind of algo in a Rust lib and then expose an API to call it from other languages. With C/C++ its really easy but I havent found the "magic bullet" for Rust.

02:06:25
<transcript>: Yeah, I know. Everyone prime is up. Is that a thing? Is there like an initiative at Netflix. So Binge is just mentioned. There's so many people from Netflix at Stream. I mean, I guess you and Trash are there others.

02:06:25
<transcript>: is there like

02:06:25
wesleycoder: everything seems wrong because everything is wrong

02:06:27
<transcript>: Is there like some.

02:06:27
<transcript>: you all should

02:06:29
<transcript>: You all should be out in the community streaming or you.

02:06:29
<transcript>: just

02:06:30
theprimeagen: i started it

02:06:30
<transcript>: Just.

02:06:30
<transcript>: you guys

02:06:33
<transcript>: You guys happen to do that.

02:06:38
theprimeagen: then other people inspired other people

02:06:39
<transcript>: Everyone doesn't run. There is no right.

02:06:39
<transcript>: wise words

02:06:41
<transcript>: Wise Words from Prime.

02:06:55
<transcript>: Music. Yeah. I think what it is. Okay. I'm just gonna come over here now. At this point, I'm just reading chat, and we're just talking. So I'm just gonna come over here.

02:06:55
<transcript>: i think

02:07:00
<transcript>: I think one of the things I'm trying to catch up here.

02:07:00
<transcript>: one

02:07:06
<transcript>: One of the things that I hang out like in these. Maybe they're like Elitist, web, circles.

02:07:06
<transcript>: that

02:07:08
theprimeagen: ok, but real talk, there is always people interested in streaming.

02:07:12
2dorkstv: ya'll are the real heroes for streaming your dev work. I dare not expose my thought process 0_o

02:07:26
<transcript>: That started, like on Twitter, just interacting with people. And then it ends up like discord servers where I'm with all these people that feel like they're constantly talking about this stuff. And they're talking about, like, the like, Minutia frontend performance, like time slicing and virtual DOMS, all this stuff that I just don't care. I really don't. I've never been able to care about that stuff.

02:07:32
tayloreddev: software dev on Twitch is really taking off

02:07:33
<transcript>: And I guess when you're comparing frameworks and you're trying to figure out which one's the best it brings or whatever you have to care about that stuff.

02:07:33
<transcript>: i just

02:07:33
akawr: @ThePrimeagen pioneer, but still no bowl tho

02:07:42
<transcript>: I just don't. And I don't know if that's like I shouldn't do front end development because I don't care about that stuff. Or if that's just a very select number of people that care about that stuff.

02:07:48
<transcript>: I don't know. That's another thing that I just feel like I fish out of water every time I'm doing a front end work.

02:07:53
<transcript>: Still no bowl? Yeah, prime. Have you seen.

02:07:53
<transcript>: a cars

02:07:56
<transcript>: A Cars Bowl thing on Twitter.

02:07:56
<transcript>: or

02:07:58
<transcript>: Or on Twitch.

02:07:59
theprimeagen: no

02:08:01
theprimeagen: i have no idea

02:08:02
ajcwebdev: Most devs don’t need to, the frameworks are all pretty good at this point

02:08:05
<transcript>: You drink out of a giant bowl. I did it one day. And then it was just so big.

02:08:05
<transcript>: it's just so big

02:08:12
<transcript>: It's just so big on my desk. Yeah. So I don't know, a car. You could explain it better, but basically on stream.

02:08:15
<transcript>: A car did like this.

02:08:15
<transcript>: i had like

02:08:26
<transcript>: I had, like, four friends with them. And they all drank out of these giant bowls, strength, their water, all these giant bowls. And it kind of like, blew up on Twitter. And then some other streamers started doing it. So it's kind of like a trend on Twitter.

02:08:26
<transcript>: or on twitch

02:08:27
<transcript>: Or on Twitch.

02:08:31
fredkisss: component architecture is not a react problem, it is the same in any Framework, but even one the prominent figures in React (Dan abramov), said you start in one file and if it becomes a pain to use you split into multiple files/components

02:08:38
<transcript>: It's easier to put water in a big bowl. And then when you go to drink water, you're drinking out of this giant thing in your face. It's kind of funny.

02:08:38
<transcript>: you have to look

02:08:42
<transcript>: You have to look it up on Twitter. I'll try and send you the Tweet if I remember.

02:08:47
akawr: i been drinking out of bowls since i started streaming regularly again lmao, then i had this dumbass ide to get a few coder friends on and do it to go viral

02:08:48
<transcript>: Most studs don't need to. The frameworks are pretty good at this point. Yeah. Maybe I'll just hang out with too many.

02:08:48
<transcript>: of the frame

02:08:48
akawr: and it worked

02:08:49
<transcript>: Of the framework.

02:08:49
<transcript>: authors

02:08:51
akawr: akawrLaugh

02:08:55
<transcript>: Authors I feel like I got led into some cool club that I don't belong in because I know nothing about the front end.

02:08:57
instafluff: so do we all need to drink from a giant water bowl now?

02:08:59
akawr: idea*

02:09:01
theprimeagen: i love this song

02:09:12
wesleycoder: doing frontend is not about choosing a best tool for you, is about doing what you can with the tools you have for the best experience you can offer for your user

02:09:15
<transcript>: And so I'm hanging out with all these people and they talk about these things. And I just don't know what they're talking about. And I feel like there's something wrong with me. Component architecture is not a React problem. It is the same in any framework, but even one. The prominent figures in React and Abramob said, starting one file and it becomes pain to use. Yeah. So I'm like, I'm writing all these components in one file.

02:09:15
<transcript>: like this game

02:09:18
akawr: @Instafluff yeah it's the new meta

02:09:29
<transcript>: Like this game, for instance, I'm doing them all in one file. I'm not like trying to split them out into files, but even still, it feels like I shouldn't have one component for all this stuff that's going on right now. I should split this out and move it into another component. But then it just introduces.

02:09:29
<transcript>: so many

02:09:30
ajcwebdev: I got on redwood core while still in a boot camp, anyone can do it honestly

02:09:32
<transcript>: So many questions like.

02:09:32
<transcript>: how

02:09:34
<transcript>: How state flows between them, I guess.

02:09:36
instafluff: @akawr okay i can be on board with this instafSip

02:09:38
wesleycoder: sometimes the tools just don't matter

02:09:38
<transcript>: Oh, a card used been drink apples since you started streaming. I didn't know that.

02:09:41
itsboek: As someone who started with php way back in the day it is funny to see everything come full circle

02:09:44
<transcript>: So do we all know.

02:09:44
<transcript>: water

02:09:47
<transcript>: Water bottle. Yes, it's the fluff. That's the idea.

02:09:52
<transcript>: Prime. I don't know if you're trolling me in my playlist of like.

02:09:52
<transcript>: very

02:10:01
theprimeagen: first off, i love this

02:10:02
<transcript>: Very old music. Jim Crowche. I used to listen to Jim Crochet in high school. I got made fun of a lot, but I didn't care. I was bigger than everybody. Like, you can't really make fun of me that much when I'm bigger than you.

02:10:06
theprimeagen: i use to play the guitar all the time

02:10:08
ziindev: He is using ping.gg?

02:10:11
<transcript>: Doing frontend is not about choosing a best tool for you is about doing what you can with the tools you have for the best experience you can offer for your user.

02:10:17
<transcript>: Yeah. I think I just constantly feel like I'm not delivering the best experience when I'm building front end.

02:10:17
<transcript>: and i

02:10:18
akawr: @akawr akawrLove

02:10:19
<transcript>: And I don't know how to fix it.

02:10:22
<transcript>: Sometimes the tools just don't matter.

02:10:24
ajcwebdev: Jim Croce is awesome

02:10:24
ziindev: the quality of the image is very good

02:10:29
<transcript>: Someone who started with PHP way back in the days, I see everything coming full circle.

02:10:36
<transcript>: Used to play guitar prime. I used to play bass guitar because my brother, my brother is actually like a musician.

02:10:36
<transcript>: he

02:10:41
<transcript>: He lives in Nashville. He was on Sony's label for a while. He's like a folk singer.

02:10:43
theprimeagen: i played 50/50 bass / guitar

02:10:44
theprimeagen: i love bass

02:10:45
theprimeagen: bass best

02:10:46
<transcript>: Now he's independent. But yeah, he's like, he's a guy.

02:10:46
<transcript>: calling elmore

02:10:51
akawr: @ziindev no, he has a dslr plugged in

02:10:51
jackysono: you guys should start a band

02:10:56
<transcript>: Calling Elmore. You look him up. He sings and writes music. So I played bass guitar for him. I used to play piano quite a bit. I could place all the Mario themes on piano.

02:11:01
akawr: i really wanna learn how to play piano

02:11:03
<transcript>: Who is using Ping a car is Linda? Is that you're saying.

02:11:07
akawr: maybe when i'm older

02:11:17
<transcript>: You played 50 50 bass in guitar. Okay. Base bets. Cool. I was in very good. I just callin my brother. Needed somebody to play with him. So I learned enough. It was just fun to do it with my brother. That kind of thing.

02:11:17
<transcript>: i could

02:11:38
<transcript>: I could, like, play. I could. I could play the song with him. But I didn't do any cool stuff, you know, like I've seen good base players do cool stuff. Like Tomo, Tomo's been around. We've seen him in Chat. He's probably not here right now, but I don't know if you've seen that prime, but Tomo, from 30 Seconds to Mars, he's getting into Web Dev. He's like, super into it.

02:11:38
<transcript>: i'm sure he's a fan of

02:11:41
<transcript>: I'm sure he's a fan of you. He's been all over Twitter.

02:11:41
<transcript>: that just

02:11:45
<transcript>: That just absorbing all of the web Dev, talk.

02:11:45
<transcript>: and he shows

02:11:51
<transcript>: And he shows up in Twitch chat. And it's so crazy to be like there's Tombo. Learn it about webdev.

02:11:51
<transcript>: or

02:12:00
adamdotdev: !camera

02:12:00
fossabot: Adam uses two main cameras, a Sony A7S III with a Sony FE 35mm F1.8 Lens which sits behind a teleprompter and serves as the wide angle shot of the office. As well as a Sony A7 IV with a Sony FE 50mm F1.2 GM which is used for the green screen camera whilst Adam is sharing his screen.

02:12:00
<transcript>: Or whatever he's doing in my channel. No, he has a DSLR plugged in. What are we talking about? Camera. Oh, yeah, the camera is you can do the camera command, and they'll tell you about my setup.

02:12:11
<transcript>: I really want to learn how to play piano. I think there's a lot to like learning an instrument. It's very therapeutic.

02:12:11
<transcript>: i

02:12:24
<transcript>: I really enjoyed when I did play. I still can play like I still set down. Sometimes there's like, a few songs that I memorized, and I'll just play them for the fun of it. The muscle memory just feels good. Kind of like them feels kind of good.

02:12:24
<transcript>: when your fingers do stuff

02:12:26
<transcript>: When your fingers do stuff that you don't really understand.

02:12:32
kedemel: I picked up guitar a few years back and it's just relaxing.

02:12:40
<transcript>: Coding homet. Thanks so much for the Follow. Also, Andre Shock. I don't know if I saw that five minutes ago. Thank you for the Follows. Picked up guitar a few years back. Just relaxing. Yeah, it's nice to have Hobbies, isn't it.

02:12:40
<transcript>: so i said things

02:12:43
<transcript>: So I said things other than programming that we do.

02:12:46
ziindev: @ziindev thanks

02:12:46
<transcript>: On that note, let's do some programming, I guess.

02:12:52
<transcript>: So I'm kind of baffled. Here with why.

02:12:56
<transcript>: Adding this. I'm trying to destructure round.

02:13:00
wesleycoder: what I'm trying to say is that we should not be stuck on a tool that we use for 8+years just because we feel confortable, we should feel free to try other tools and get wrong results until we get it right, just don't explode production

02:13:00
<transcript>: And grab the start property or start whatever.

02:13:02
<transcript>: And for some reason.

02:13:07
<transcript>: Like all my types are broken when I try and add.

02:13:07
<transcript>: that

02:13:08
whoa_dood: you only need to know how to play two songs one to impress em and one to prove you know more than one song LUL

02:13:09
<transcript>: That one thing.

02:13:09
<transcript>: like now

02:13:10
<transcript>: Like now.

02:13:10
<transcript>: no that's still

02:13:13
<transcript>: No, that's still in any why are these innies.

02:13:17
<transcript>: So maybe it wasn't related. That. Oh, maybe it's this. Maybe it's just.

02:13:21
<transcript>: I love when it's simple stuff.

02:13:25
<transcript>: So now that works now still doesn't work.

02:13:27
<transcript>: What's going on.

02:13:29
<transcript>: Correct.

02:13:34
<transcript>: Correct equals round and three equals choice.

02:13:38
<transcript>: What do I do? Do I have some Invalid something somewhere.

02:13:38
<transcript>: else

02:13:41
<transcript>: Else. Lsp restart this thing. Feel like something's.

02:13:44
<transcript>: Something's wrong.

02:13:50
<transcript>: Okay.

02:13:50
<transcript>: i think

02:13:52
<transcript>: I think it's working now.

02:13:52
akawr: the sounds your keyboard make are 🤤

02:13:56
<transcript>: Round or null, and then this round.

02:14:04
<transcript>: Prime. I'm trying to I'm trying to learn, then navigation. I'm watching your videos. I'm just so slow it's so taken me so long to pick it up.

02:14:08
theprimeagen: dap those MF

02:14:21
<transcript>: What I'm trying to say is we should not be stuck on a tool that we use for a plus years just because we feel comfortable. Oh, I gotcha we should feel free to try other tools and get wrong results until we get it right. Just don't explode production. Yeah, I think the next thing I build, the next thing I build.

02:14:34
<transcript>: I'm gonna use Solid. I'm just. I've determined Solid is the next thing I want to play with. I'm gonna build some kind of app web app with Solid, and just see how it feels because I've heard too many good things.

02:14:34
<transcript>: i

02:14:37
<transcript>: I respect Dax a lot, and he says, It's great.

02:14:42
wesleycoder: bold move

02:14:43
kedemel: I'm in the .NET World. I am going to try Rust next.

02:14:44
<transcript>: Dapum so DAP would be what DAP would be delete all.

02:14:44
<transcript>: of

02:14:49
<transcript>: Of a paragraph. So I'm going to leave, like this whole thing. Yeah.

02:14:51
theprimeagen: delete around paragraph

02:14:55
theprimeagen: "around"

02:14:59
<transcript>: In the network going to try Rust next delete around paragraph. Oh, yeah, yeah, around paragraph. What was. I was I deleting.

02:15:02
<transcript>: Remember.

02:15:05
<transcript>: Oh, we got this. This works. Now.

02:15:07
theprimeagen: helps you know that whitespace on bottom will be removed

02:15:13
<transcript>: It's around. We did it. It's around. So now if I say I want the start, why is that not there.

02:15:16
<transcript>: This. So what's so wrong with that.

02:15:16
<transcript>: round

02:15:20
<transcript>: Round. Has a start. Has a start on it. I promise.

02:15:29
<transcript>: We got something weird going on here. I feel like this isn't my fault.

02:15:29
<transcript>: most of

02:15:35
<transcript>: Most of time stuff is my fault. When there's weird stuff happening, it's usually my fault. This time I don't feel like it is.

02:15:35
<transcript>: something else

02:15:37
<transcript>: Something else.

02:15:42
<transcript>: Did I just do something weird in them? I can't even, like, click on anything now.

02:15:45
<transcript>: Okay. See what we're gonna do.

02:15:47
<transcript>: Turnover.

02:15:50
<transcript>: Restart an Inv.

02:15:50
<transcript>: invite

02:15:51
<transcript>: Invite.

02:15:55
<transcript>: Should we start it.

02:15:57
<transcript>: Right.

02:15:58
<transcript>: Okay.

02:15:58
<transcript>: so

02:16:00
<transcript>: So round.

02:16:00
<transcript>: is

02:16:02
<transcript>: Is a round.

02:16:02
<transcript>: that means

02:16:05
<transcript>: That means I should be able to say round.

02:16:13
ajcwebdev: I’m writing a Solid course right now and I’ve been chatting with Ryan for a while, i feel like learning it has made me a better dev, highly recommend it. SolidStart still has a ways to go though.

02:16:16
<transcript>: Start. There it is. There's. Start property. So if I want to I want to deconstruct that. And I want to say, Star heart.

02:16:16
<transcript>: why

02:16:17
<transcript>: Why.

02:16:24
<transcript>: Delete around paragraph.

02:16:24
<transcript>: i'm

02:16:33
<transcript>: I'm writing a solid course right now. I've been chatting with Ryan for a while. Oh, really? I didn't know you were writing it. It's so hard for me to say AJ, AJC. I don't know why.

02:16:33
<transcript>: i

02:16:38
<transcript>: I can picture your little like Pineapple face on Twitter. That's you right. Ajc.

02:16:49
cristhianjhlcom: HeyGuys

02:16:50
<transcript>: Vinceng was Ryan for a while. Feel like learning it has made me a better Dev. Highly recommend it. So I'll start sews away to go, though. Yeah. So my thought was I was gonna build a solid app with Astro. Is that a bad idea? I want to learn how.

02:16:50
<transcript>: so

02:16:55
ajcwebdev: lol all good my name is Anthony yup

02:16:57
<transcript>: So if I want to do any kind of server side stuff, I'll use Astro, but I'll use the Astro solid bindings or whatever.

02:16:57
<transcript>: to do the

02:16:59
<transcript>: To do the front end and solid.

02:17:00
ajcwebdev: And yeah it’s a donut haha

02:17:03
<transcript>: All good name is Anthony. Okay Anthony's, way easier.

02:17:03
<transcript>: and if i can remember

02:17:08
ajcwebdev: That’s a great idea

02:17:10
<transcript>: And if I can remember that Steve, whatever is Step Ro, I can remember that AJC is a Anthony, I think.

02:17:13
<transcript>: It's a donut? That's a donut.

02:17:13
<transcript>: what

02:17:15
<transcript>: What.

02:17:15
<transcript>: are you serious

02:17:16
<transcript>: Are you serious.

02:17:16
<transcript>: hang on

02:17:17
<transcript>: Hang on.

02:17:23
<transcript>: Ajc tell me that's a donut. Oh, it is a donut. Oh, wow, yeah. Okay.

02:17:23
<transcript>: that was a pineap

02:17:28
kedemel: LUL

02:17:28
<transcript>: That was a pineapine. It's a fish. And a donut has glasses.

02:17:28
<transcript>: and a

02:17:32
wesleycoder: solidjs + astro rocks

02:17:44
<transcript>: And a Fanny pack. My wife started wearing a Fanny pack again, and I realized, oh, it's actually kind of cool. Manufacturer cool. My dad wore him, like when we were growing up. And we went to, like, Disney World. We have all the pictures. And he has a Fanny pack. I just thought they were not cool anymore. But my wife, she rocks that Fanny pack. It looks pretty cool.

02:17:44
kedemel: I love that fanny packs are coming back. Perfect.

02:17:46
<transcript>: I don't know why I can't.

02:17:46
<transcript>: like i can't

02:17:47
delvoid: i can see the pineapple when not zoomed in

02:17:51
<transcript>: Like I can't deconstruct that round and I feel like it's not my fault.

02:17:52
ajcwebdev: Lol it’s a loopy donut

02:17:57
<transcript>: See how it keeps me affecting this type up here.

02:17:59
<transcript>: I don't understand.

02:18:05
<transcript>: Does Anyone understand this.

02:18:05
<transcript>: any like

02:18:06
ajcwebdev: It’s an nft 🤫

02:18:07
<transcript>: Any like TypeScript.

02:18:09
<transcript>: Pros in here.

02:18:22
<transcript>: Solid plus Astro Rocks Cool thanks for the follow Fun canceling.

02:18:30
<transcript>: Love that Fanny packs are coming back. They're so practical. I mean, it makes so much sense to just store that stuff right there in a little pouch. Like a Kangaroo.

02:18:44
wesleycoder: it seems to be a problem with prisma type generations

02:18:45
<transcript>: It's an NFT out and NFT? What series? Or is that the term what series of NFT? Is that? What traits does it have? I know things. Look at me. I know things about about NFPs. Thanks for the follow. Cana.

02:18:51
<transcript>: It's a problem with Prisma type generations. Yeah, it does. It seems to be.

02:18:51
<transcript>: something

02:18:53
instafluff: LUL

02:18:53
<transcript>: Something bad.

02:18:57
ajcwebdev: Try prisma generate

02:19:01
<transcript>: I'm just gonna not I'm not gonna deconstruct it.

02:19:01
<transcript>: i'm just gonna use

02:19:04
<transcript>: I'm just gonna use Round star.

02:19:04
<transcript>: and

02:19:07
<transcript>: And then work around it that way, I guess.

02:19:07
<transcript>: so

02:19:16
<transcript>: So elapse. Okay. Well, I'm realizing now that was like an hour ago that I wrote Const elapsed equals, and now we're just getting back.

02:19:16
<transcript>: so

02:19:16
ajcwebdev: Loopy donuts is the collection, they’re like $10 lol

02:19:21
<transcript>: So it'd be now minus start right.

02:19:28
<transcript>: Oh, you can't do this with dates. I always think you can do this with dates. What do I think? That.

02:19:33
<transcript>: Can you do that in another language that I maybe I'm familiar with.

02:19:39
<transcript>: I do hate JavaScript date stuff.

02:19:52
<transcript>: Loopy. Donuts is the collection they're like, $10. Okay. That's that actually makes me think more highly of you that you didn't spend, like thousands of dollars on the NFT. I'm happy to hear it was $10.

02:19:56
2dorkstv: oh .. now I want donuts

02:20:01
<transcript>: Prime if you're still here.

02:20:01
<transcript>: is the twitch

02:20:06
<transcript>: Is the Twitch stuff bad for you? Did you lose money on the Twitch announcement.

02:20:06
<transcript>: you're big

02:20:07
<transcript>: You're big.

02:20:07
<transcript>: just don't know

02:20:12
wesleycoder: I love these filters

02:20:14
tiredbeaver: prime doesn't care about twitch money

02:20:18
<transcript>: Just don't know how many people we talked about this to be in a stream. I don't know how many people have affected. I know there's a lot of outrage, a lot of pushback. But is it like ten people or like thousands of people that are just lost money.

02:20:18
<transcript>: prime

02:20:20
<transcript>: Prime doesn't care about Twitch money.

02:20:20
<transcript>: i mean i don't

02:20:24
<transcript>: I mean, I don't know if there's any programmer on Twitch. Care about Twitch money.

02:20:24
<transcript>: probably not

02:20:26
<transcript>: Probably not.

02:20:30
<transcript>: So that's our last.

02:20:30
<transcript>: and i

02:20:34
<transcript>: And I guess that's a number.

02:20:35
tiredbeaver: why care when you make 500k+ at netflix LUL

02:20:46
<transcript>: We want to get the percentage like we did on the front end. Oh, man. Remember how hard it was for us to figure out the percentage for how hard it was for me to figure it out. You guys probably all figured it out, and you just watch me struggle.

02:20:49
<transcript>: This is a number of milliseconds.

02:20:49
<transcript>: elapses

02:20:51
<transcript>: Elapses.

02:20:51
<transcript>: so we

02:20:52
<transcript>: So we need to know.

02:20:55
<transcript>: Out of the total.

02:20:55
<transcript>: like

02:20:58
<transcript>: Like expires minus start.

02:21:00
<transcript>: So.

02:21:02
<transcript>: Total equals.

02:21:02
<transcript>: exp

02:21:06
<transcript>: Expires minus roundup start.

02:21:06
<transcript>: that's

02:21:09
<transcript>: That's the total number of milliseconds, right.

02:21:11
<transcript>: Right.

02:21:14
<transcript>: Okay.

02:21:14
<transcript>: so

02:21:15
<transcript>: So.

02:21:15
<transcript>: elapse

02:21:22
<transcript>: Elapse is the number of milliseconds into the round that you got it that you answered.

02:21:24
<transcript>: Then the percentage.

02:21:30
<transcript>: Progress. I'll call it Progress. Is.

02:21:34
<transcript>: Elapsed.

02:21:39
<transcript>: Something like Elapse divided by Total. But I know there's like some stuff I got to do, right.

02:21:42
<transcript>: Gotta do like round.

02:21:42
<transcript>: oh

02:21:47
<transcript>: Oh, I got to do, like math floor or something.

02:21:47
<transcript>: i don't know

02:21:49
<transcript>: I don't know. Someone coming. What I got to do.

02:21:49
<transcript>: round start

02:21:51
<transcript>: Round Start also.

02:21:56
<transcript>: Get time.

02:21:59
<transcript>: I already did that. Should I do that.

02:21:59
<transcript>: once

02:22:00
<transcript>: Once.

02:22:03
<transcript>: I guess since I can't.

02:22:09
<transcript>: Since I can't deconstruct start I can just have a start variable start equals round start.

02:22:12
<transcript>: And then I can just.

02:22:17
<transcript>: So. Okay, how would I do this? Let's do the right thing in Vim and not just start.

02:22:17
<transcript>: typing

02:22:24
<transcript>: Typing the lead or whatever. So follow delete. All of this. I want to replace all of this.

02:22:27
<transcript>: What would I do.

02:22:33
<transcript>: So, like, if I'm in a word, I know, I just like, See, I doubt you or whatever.

02:22:33
<transcript>: but if i'm

02:22:44
<transcript>: But if I'm if I want to do all the way to the end of the file, I guess what I just do, like, See, dollar sign. Yeah, I guess that's probably right. And then on this one, I can just do Dot. No, I gotta actually go to here.

02:22:44
<transcript>: yeah

02:22:45
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:22:47
<transcript>: First try.

02:22:51
<transcript>: Progress. This is assigned to value so can.

02:22:51
<transcript>: elapse divide

02:22:54
<transcript>: Elapse, divide it by total. That's gonna be.

02:22:54
<transcript>: that's

02:22:58
christoph0saurus: you can just do capital 'C' for end of the line

02:22:59
cybera1on: you using mongodb?

02:23:02
<transcript>: That's gonna be what that's? A number of milliseconds. No, that's a should be a percentage.

02:23:05
<transcript>: I might need to multiply by a hundred or something.

02:23:08
<transcript>: What's wrong with this? What is going on.

02:23:13
<transcript>: Correct implicitly has type inning because it does not have a type.

02:23:13
<transcript>: reference

02:23:20
<transcript>: Reference directly or indirectly, in its own initializer. It's a boolean right roundup answer equals choice.

02:23:23
<transcript>: Throw off that.

02:23:29
<transcript>: Why is this an any. There's something wrong with Prisma. And it's bothering me.

02:23:33
<transcript>: Restart.

02:23:34
de_pannu: How long it would take to master this for a totally newbie ??

02:23:42
<transcript>: Bothering me, cyber, welcome to Chat. I'm not using Manga DB. We're using Planet Scale, which is MySQL and Prisma is the.org.

02:23:44
<transcript>: The reluctant.

02:23:48
<transcript>: Now I want Donuts me too.

02:23:48
<transcript>: prime

02:23:52
<transcript>: Prime doesn't care which way? Why care when you make fires on the Netflix.

02:23:52
<transcript>: you can just do

02:23:58
cybera1on: nice

02:24:01
<transcript>: You can just do a capital C for end of the line. Oh, so capital C will just replace to the end of line. That is so good to know, Christoph, thank you so much.

02:24:06
<transcript>: How long it would take to master this for a total newbie.

02:24:06
<transcript>: master what

02:24:07
<transcript>: Master? What.

02:24:07
<transcript>: the

02:24:10
<transcript>: The Deepanu, master.

02:24:13
<transcript>: Did you ask me a previous question? Here.

02:24:16
cowfacedude99: @christoph0saurus there's a D too

02:24:19
<transcript>: Master.

02:24:19
<transcript>: there's

02:24:21
<transcript>: There's A. D.

02:24:28
<transcript>: Where's A. D. You're saying Capital C goes to the end of the line. Capital D goes to.

02:24:28
<transcript>: the oh

02:24:34
<transcript>: The. Oh, that just deletes to the inline. Oh, nice. Okay, let's practice that because I'm tired of all the prison.

02:24:39
<transcript>: So if I'm saying I'm right here and I want to replace.

02:24:39
<transcript>: nice

02:24:41
cybera1on: do delete till end

02:24:44
tiredbeaver: @christoph0saurus I think shift+s might be better because it also does the indent

02:24:45
<transcript>: Nice. Okay. And if I wanted to delete it, I Sud. Wow, that's okay.

02:24:45
<transcript>: so

02:24:54
tiredbeaver: wait nvm

02:24:54
<transcript>: So I've been this whole time I feel so good, because this whole time I've been doing B. And then dollar sign. And dollar sign is not something I just easily click. I have to like, think about it.

02:24:54
<transcript>: shift

02:24:56
<transcript>: Shift.

02:24:56
<transcript>: four

02:24:57
<transcript>: Four.

02:25:02
tiredbeaver: shift+s replaces whole line he just wants to end

02:25:02
<transcript>: Shift S might be better than shift C.

02:25:06
<transcript>: cfift

02:25:06
<transcript>: cfift s replaces

02:25:12
<transcript>: Cfift S replaces whole line. I just went to the end. Oh, so I can shift S to replace the whole line. Oh, that's cool, too.

02:25:16
<transcript>: How many cool things? I love them. It's so great.

02:25:23
<transcript>: Okay, progress is elapsed divided by total. Let's just do this. Let's do console log progress.

02:25:35
<transcript>: Okay, so now we're actually gonna update the score. We're just doing it the simple way right now, but I'm gonna start logging progress so we can get a sense for what is that number.

02:25:36
cybera1on: what theme are you using for vim?

02:25:38
cowfacedude99: one verb at a time LUL

02:25:42
<transcript>: What we want is a number from like zero to 100 to know, like the percentage through the thing we are.

02:25:46
cowfacedude99: dracula @CyberA1on

02:25:47
<transcript>: What theme am I using for vim? It's Dracula.

02:25:51
<transcript>: I use jacket all over the place. I even use Dracula.

02:25:51
<transcript>: on my

02:25:53
cybera1on: ok ty

02:25:53
<transcript>: On my keyboard.

02:25:53
<transcript>: dra

02:25:55
fragaverage: dracula always

02:25:57
<transcript>: Dracula. It's everywhere. It's physically. With me.

02:25:57
<transcript>: and

02:26:00
<transcript>: And digitally with me everywhere I go.

02:26:06
tiredbeaver: he is vampire

02:26:09
tiredbeaver: confirmed

02:26:10
cybera1on: woah

02:26:13
<transcript>: I just kind of wish it were something that weren't so common because I just feel like I'm gonna try different themes and be kind of like Edgy. But like, my keyboard is printed as Dracula. So what am I gonna do? Thank you for the follow.

02:26:13
<transcript>: aug fl

02:26:15
<transcript>: Aug. Flavo.

02:26:15
<transcript>: flavoxlav

02:26:16
<transcript>: Flavoxlav.

02:26:22
<transcript>: Let's see. I'm a vampire. Confirmed.

02:26:29
<transcript>: So. Okay. What do we want to do here? We want to. We want to test this. Do I have to restart the server? I don't think so.

02:26:36
<transcript>: I don't think so. So now the score should start changing. That's good news. Oh, I guess I need to return the score.

02:26:41
<transcript>: But to do that, I'll have to actually.

02:26:45
<transcript>: Here. I'll have to say Const game.

02:26:47
<transcript>: We'll just return the whole game, right.

02:26:49
<transcript>: Yes.

02:26:55
caldotjs: what is your estimation regarding finish date of awguess ?:)

02:26:56
<transcript>: Okay. So then I have the score on it. I guess that'll have the update score, right? Yeah.

02:26:59
<transcript>: Let's do this.

02:26:59
<transcript>: the

02:27:01
<transcript>: The Game machine.

02:27:03
<transcript>: Yeah, it's gone away.

02:27:06
<transcript>: It's going away, not using it.

02:27:06
<transcript>: i was

02:27:07
<transcript>: I was dumb.

02:27:15
<transcript>: It was a dumb, dumb moment where I thought I needed a state machine. I did not need a state machine machine. I just needed to calm down.

02:27:15
<transcript>: okay

02:27:18
<transcript>: Okay. And now I have to pee again. I'm sorry.

02:27:18
<transcript>: with the

02:27:22
<transcript>: With the Peeing. So much Peeing, Little Bear. Back.

02:27:42
instafluff: drank too much from the water bowl LUL

02:31:17
<transcript>: All right.

02:31:20
<transcript>: Music. This is too much.

02:31:20
<transcript>: while i'm thinking

02:31:27
<transcript>: While I'm thinking I'm thinking about what I'm reading, which is Kaldad is here. What is your estimation regarding finished date of A to BJS.

02:31:36
<transcript>: Last Friday was about how much time I alluded for A to B guess. And we're still here. So what is today, Thursday first day of fall.

02:31:36
<transcript>: my

02:31:39
<transcript>: My new estimate is quarter four.

02:31:39
<transcript>: hopefully

02:31:41
<transcript>: Hopefully done by winter.

02:31:47
<transcript>: Also welcome, Caldap. Good to see you. Hince. The Fluff. Drinks so much water from the waterball.

02:31:47
<transcript>: now i

02:31:56
<transcript>: Now I did the water bowl thing one day, a car if you're still here. I did it one day. And then it just took up like a giant space on my desk so I couldn't keep doing it.

02:31:56
<transcript>: but

02:31:59
<transcript>: But I was happy to be part of the meta.

02:32:03
<transcript>: All right.

02:32:10
<transcript>: Let's go back to it so we can actually finish a B guess. Well let's talk about what is the finished AW guess I think.

02:32:10
<transcript>: we could

02:32:11
instafluff: it seems like a good meta!

02:32:13
caldotjs: Q4 sounds great :D haha yeah I mean if its fun than that's fine. fortunately there are no obligations or due dates here

02:32:17
<transcript>: We could we could kind of move on. I could, like work on other stuff once we've got it published. So what is good enough to publish.

02:32:17
<transcript>: a single play

02:32:28
<transcript>: A single player is probably five. People can click new game. They can start playing it, seeing their score. And but I guess they need to be able to like, let score needs to live on. Right. We need, like, a leaderboard of some sort.

02:32:35
instafluff: this game is a fun idea btw! i want to play it

02:32:48
<transcript>: So let's just say that. Let's just say we're not going to include multiplayer in the first version. We're just gonna build single player, you click new game, you do your game, and then you get a score, and that gets posted to a leaderboard. That's it. Okay. And then we're publishing it. We're putting it all on Versaille. And we're gonna see if we want to come back.

02:32:48
<transcript>: to it

02:32:50
<transcript>: To it and make multiplayer and all that stuff.

02:32:50
<transcript>: a few force

02:32:52
<transcript>: A few force sounds great.

02:32:52
<transcript>: i mean if it

02:32:57
<transcript>: I mean, if it's fun, then that's fine. Fortunately, there are no obligations or due dates here. That's true.

02:32:57
<transcript>: that's the bless

02:33:08
<transcript>: That's the blessing in the curse of my life. There are no due dates. Great. It's fun not to have due dates, but also there are no due dates. What am I doing with my life? I'm wondering aimlessly.

02:33:14
<transcript>: Okay. That sounded way darker than it is. I love my life.

02:33:14
<transcript>: okay

02:33:16
<transcript>: Okay.

02:33:16
caldotjs: yeah I get that! I kinda like due dates too :D

02:33:19
<transcript>: It'll expired.

02:33:26
<transcript>: Where are we? This is the point where I decided earlier. We need a we need to make a.

02:33:31
<transcript>: State machine. And then we said, no, we don't.

02:33:31
<transcript>: okay

02:33:32
<transcript>: Okay.

02:33:32
<transcript>: let's look

02:33:37
<transcript>: Let's look at some logs. We're gonna be logging here. We should start seeing.

02:33:42
<transcript>: The Elapsed numbers.

02:33:45
<transcript>: Okay new game.

02:33:50
caldotjs: I think a balance of projects you need to finish and stuff you can touch whenever you want is awesome

02:33:54
<transcript>: Snowmobile. That one is easy. There's our lapse .4094 wow, I'm close. I just need to multiply by a hundred and, like.

02:33:54
<transcript>: round it

02:34:03
<transcript>: Round it or something, so it's just two decimals. I guess it doesn't matter. I have to round it. Oh, click on something. I was wrong, but one. I was just after the buzzer.

02:34:06
<transcript>: Snowball edge.

02:34:08
<transcript>: And the number for this one should be up.

02:34:08
<transcript>: oh

02:34:10
<transcript>: Oh, it's broken.

02:34:10
<transcript>: see what is that

02:34:12
<transcript>: See? What is that.

02:34:16
<transcript>: What is that state we get into where it's broken.

02:34:22
<transcript>: That's a pretty big bug.

02:34:25
<transcript>: Yeah. Kind of like due dates.

02:34:25
<transcript>: instafu wants to

02:34:30
<transcript>: Instafu wants to play it. Let's get it out there so it's a plus conflay.

02:34:30
<transcript>: i want to play

02:34:38
instafluff: YAAAS!

02:34:45
<transcript>: I want to play it. I get stuck playing it on occasion, and I realize I've been sitting there for five minutes. I think about the projects you need to finish and stuff you can touch whenever you want is awesome. Yeah. Here's the thing, Calvat. Now that I'm only streaming two days a week.

02:34:45
<transcript>: i kind of don't

02:34:49
<transcript>: I kind of don't care what I do on these streams. It's just two of my days.

02:34:49
<transcript>: it's like i've still

02:35:03
<transcript>: It's like I've still got other time in the week to do other things I need to get done. So this stream is kind of become, like, for fun Z's. It was already for fun Z. But I was trying to do it every day before. And so I was trying to, like, work on the stuff I would work on normally.

02:35:03
<transcript>: now i'm

02:35:19
<transcript>: Now I'm just streaming the two days. I kind of like I work on whatever. So there's really no timeline. I don't want you guys to get bored. If you guys show up every day and you're getting bored, I guess every other day, whatever. I do it twice a week. If you come to twice a week and you're getting tired of seeing the same thing, we'll move on.

02:35:19
<transcript>: you guys can vote

02:35:23
<transcript>: You guys can vote. Let's do a poll. Think Frag, you can start a poll, right.

02:35:28
<transcript>: Like, do we want to move on from this? Are we done with it.

02:35:28
<transcript>: detective

02:35:30
<transcript>: Detective. That one was easy.

02:35:36
<transcript>: I know this one. What is it? I know it.

02:35:36
<transcript>: a little elemental

02:35:39
<transcript>: A little elemental link. No, I don't think that's it.

02:35:39
<transcript>: why is this

02:35:41
<transcript>: Why is this one? Hard? Mq.

02:35:41
<transcript>: it's the cue

02:35:42
caldotjs: I think most people are watching you more than they are watching the project, I would guess

02:35:44
<transcript>: It's the cue. We're capitalized. I think I would have got that one.

02:35:47
<transcript>: Directory service.

02:35:47
<transcript>: see

02:35:53
<transcript>: See there. It's not. Sometimes it's not working. And I don't even think it's doing this.

02:35:53
<transcript>: mutation

02:35:56
<transcript>: Mutation, right? It didn't even do it.

02:35:56
<transcript>: so

02:35:58
<transcript>: So we have some kind of bug.

02:35:58
<transcript>: this

02:36:01
<transcript>: This is why I needed a state machine. People.

02:36:01
<transcript>: this is why we need to

02:36:03
<transcript>: This is why we need to state machine.

02:36:03
<transcript>: see we got

02:36:11
<transcript>: See, we got this weird state. We got weird things happening. Like, I bet this is what happened. I bet one of these things was true. Expired. Probably.

02:36:14
<transcript>: How this all sue so bad.

02:36:23
<transcript>: So we won't check expired.

02:36:24
cowfacedude99: console.log debugging time LUL

02:36:25
<transcript>: Here.

02:36:31
<transcript>: Not a Friday. Fix that bug, but we're that make it where you can get one in at the buzzer that you shouldn't have.

02:36:31
<transcript>: the

02:36:37
nexxeln: hi adam

02:36:38
<transcript>: The back end is saying it's expired, so it's not updating the score. Oh, Geez, go fast, Debra, Sir. Of course.

02:36:41
<transcript>: Okay.

02:36:41
<transcript>: gink

02:36:46
<transcript>: Gink Bracket Media Store. What do we think? Monotron.

02:36:46
<transcript>: yeah

02:36:47
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:36:53
<transcript>: Once I testing. I was testing something.

02:36:53
<transcript>: oh yeah i was looking

02:36:57
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. I was looking at the numbers. Yeah. These numbers are good, personalized guys.

02:36:59
caldotjs: whats the project afterwards? are we already shooting for the community SAAS framework or is it smth else?

02:36:59
austencam: Commenting stuff out? Making guesses? This is my kind of debugging!

02:37:03
<transcript>: That's gonna be FSX, quite sure.

02:37:03
<transcript>: no

02:37:07
<transcript>: No, there it goes. See? It didn't call the mutation again.

02:37:17
<transcript>: Austin Cam. Welcome to Chat. Austin. Commenting stuff out. Making guesses is my kind of debugging. That's how I do it around here.

02:37:17
<transcript>: hey next one

02:37:19
<transcript>: Hey, next one's here.

02:37:25
<transcript>: I think most people are watching you more than they are watching the project, I would guess. Okay, cool. You're watching my face.

02:37:28
<transcript>: It's my face. Just thinking.

02:37:31
<transcript>: Should I do stuff like this more to make it more interesting.

02:37:42
tiredbeaver: how does it feel to have a beard

02:37:44
<transcript>: What's the project afterwards? Are we ready? Or we already should for the community Sat framework? Or is it something else? Oh, oh, Calbot. What's next.

02:37:44
<transcript>: great question

02:37:46
<transcript>: Great question. I talked about this at the beginning.

02:37:48
tiredbeaver: i can only grow mustache

02:37:54
<transcript>: What's next is we're gonna build a little AWS CLI that creates it's like.

02:37:57
ajcwebdev: @nexxeln yo yo

02:38:03
nexxeln: yoo @ajcwebdev

02:38:04
caldotjs: CLI.. do I hear rust?

02:38:06
<transcript>: Starting your if you just you want to play with AWS or web developers but it seems intimidating you don't know like creating accounts and like credentials.

02:38:06
<transcript>: and

02:38:09
<transcript>: And Billing and all these things that scare you.

02:38:09
<transcript>: it's

02:38:22
<transcript>: It's a CLI that's meant to take you from, like, you just signed up on. Aws, you just created a new account, so you have to put in your credit card and all that stuff. But you created a new account. You have a blank account, and there's gonna be a CLI we're gonna build that allows you to from there.

02:38:22
<transcript>: instantiate

02:38:25
<transcript>: Instantiate. A bunch of stuff.

02:38:25
<transcript>: like create

02:38:32
nexxeln: perfect application of rust

02:38:39
ajcwebdev: You’re building an SST competitor?

02:38:45
<transcript>: Like create a prod and a Dev account. It's like best practices, but really like for simple serverless apps for, like, startups, not for enterprise, right? It's like I'm an indie maker, or I'm a startup, and I want to do the thing. That's right. I want to have separate accounts for workloads, but I want to set up SSO and my user on SSO and having access.

02:38:45
<transcript>: to account

02:38:58
wesleycoder: is this what you commented yesterday about deploying nextjs on aws?

02:39:05
<transcript>: To accounts. I want to set up my CLI environment so that I can login to AWS through SSO and not having any longlived. I am credentials all that stuff right up in a nice little CLI where you can just be like MPX, start the thing and it does all that right. I think I'm trying to just reduce the friction for web developers who think that they believe the whole.

02:39:05
<transcript>: trope that

02:39:05
caldotjs: this sounds awesome! glad I will have more free time available by then. As someone who has 0 knowledge about AWS that sounds valuable to watch

02:39:15
<transcript>: Trope that AWS is just too complex and too much for them. It's really not once you get that initial setup done and you've got multiple accounts, you don't even have to go in the console, like at that point.

02:39:15
<transcript>: you're just building

02:39:18
<transcript>: You're just building stuff in your IDE.

02:39:18
<transcript>: you know

02:39:19
<transcript>: You know you're you're using.

02:39:19
<transcript>: ssd

02:39:20
mdg212: you speak spanish? iam from venezuela

02:39:32
tayloreddev: this would be cool, aws is intimidating for the newb

02:39:37
<transcript>: Ssd or Architect or some other serverless framework, something that makes development nice on the cloud. And you just got all these new tools at your disposal, like you're used to having Versaille where you can deploy web apps. But then you're like, oh, I need a Chron or I need a queue or something that Versell just had a dock for that point you to other services.

02:39:37
<transcript>: at that point

02:39:43
wesleycoder: this seems awesome

02:39:44
<transcript>: At that point, you can say, oh, I have. Aws, I can do that. That's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to help bridge that gap.

02:39:52
<transcript>: Is this what you commented yesterday about the playing next year? It's on AWS. So Wesley, there's.

02:39:52
<transcript>: nest

02:39:55
<transcript>: Nest, which is a CLI tool that I made.

02:39:55
<transcript>: a

02:40:00
<transcript>: A long time ago. It's for deploying web Apps, integrated account.

02:40:00
<transcript>: it's

02:40:03
<transcript>: It's. It's kind of stale. At this point. I'm being honest.

02:40:03
<transcript>: it's it's not

02:40:16
<transcript>: It's it's not something that I'm really keeping up with, because honestly, I just started using Versaille. And it felt like, I don't know. I will say, oh, this is what you're talking about. What I talked about yesterday. There's something coming.

02:40:16
<transcript>: it's not by me

02:40:21
<transcript>: It's not by me. There's something coming soon that will make it easier to deploy your.

02:40:21
<transcript>: next apps

02:40:24
<transcript>: Next apps on AWS on your own a Tobis account.

02:40:24
<transcript>: with all

02:40:26
<transcript>: With all Next features.

02:40:26
<transcript>: so

02:40:30
<transcript>: So nest the thing I made it's like always a version behind.

02:40:30
<transcript>: this

02:40:35
texoport: Oh sick, I remember seeing ness on Hackernews a while ago. Didn't know it was you.

02:40:44
nexxeln: doesn't vercel do the same thing? deploy nextjs on aws

02:40:47
<transcript>: This will it'll have all the latest version? Twelve, like middleware, all the next JS stuff you're used to on verse, but then your own AWS account. That's all I'm gonna say. That's all I can say. I don't know if I can even say that, but I just said it because what it does twist? No one knows no one knows I said anything on Twitch, right.

02:40:47
<transcript>: except

02:40:52
<transcript>: Except for Well, except for the people who work for AWS, who are here listening. Sorry.

02:40:54
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:40:57
<transcript>: You guys are all talking.

02:40:59
instafluff: WOO! LUL

02:41:10
<transcript>: How does it feel to have a beard? You can only grow, massage. It's nice. I've had a beard for years and I probably will always have a beard. My bear face looks like a paper plate. I've just got a very round face. So when it doesn't have a beard, it's just like.

02:41:12
<transcript>: Just. It's not good.

02:41:15
ajcwebdev: @nexxeln difference is you can’t get at the underlying infra on vercel

02:41:25
<transcript>: Cli. Do I hear rust? Maybe I thought about building in Rust because I really want to learn rest and it's just a really simple CLI. It's just making a much SDK calls. Aws, SDK calls. I think it'd be a great thing to learn Russ with.

02:41:25
<transcript>: yeah

02:41:25
wesleycoder: That will blow my mind I'm sure, I'm stuck on this problem for 6 months now, not being able to push nextjs foward on my job because of deploy problems is a pain on my ass

02:41:37
<transcript>: Yeah, perfect application. Rest. You're building an SSD competitor? No. In fact, the only person I've talked with in depth about what I'm building is DAX from SST. I'm building something that SSD wants to exist.

02:41:47
<transcript>: Sst is like infrastructure as code it lays on top of the CDK and just build a good developer experience for building serverless apps with the CDK on AWS.

02:41:48
nexxeln: @ajcwebdev oh makes sense

02:42:07
<transcript>: That I'm not doing anything like that. I'm just making a little CLI to make it easy to start up your accounts, put billing alerts in place so that you're not surprised by bills. Maybe do some like AWS organization stuff like set up an Ou and with SCPs to limit what services you can use. So you don't accidentally use a service that's really expensive, that kind of stuff.

02:42:07
<transcript>: it's like

02:42:11
<transcript>: It's like Guardrails, OOH, guardrail. I've been trying to think of a name for it. Card. Really.

02:42:22
<transcript>: I need a name, though. We need a workshop. It somebody. Maybe just send me a name. That'd be great.

02:42:32
<transcript>: But no, it's nothing competing with SSD. In fact, DAX is the only person that's been kind of talking through it with me and trying to figure out what would this look like? And how would it be helpful.

02:42:35
<transcript>: And they're very much on board.

02:42:43
<transcript>: Okay, sounds awesome. Glad I will have more free time build other than as someone who has zero knowledge about AWS, that sounds valuable to watch. Cool.

02:42:43
<transcript>: mdg

02:42:49
<transcript>: Mdg. Welcome to Chat. Also, thanks to the follow MDG, I appreciate that I do not speak Spanish.

02:42:49
<transcript>: you're from

02:42:50
<transcript>: You're From Venezuela.

02:42:50
<transcript>: i am an

02:43:04
<transcript>: I am an American, which means I speak one language because no one taught me as a kid that it'd be valuable to learn other languages. I will say my wife's best friend will be moving in with us in January.

02:43:04
<transcript>: and

02:43:05
<transcript>: And she.

02:43:05
<transcript>: is spanish

02:43:07
<transcript>: Is Spanish.

02:43:07
<transcript>: sorry her

02:43:18
<transcript>: Sorry. Her parents are Mexican. I mean, she's Mexican. I don't know. She's. She's a Spanish American. She's a Mexican American. She never. She didn't grow up in Mexico. She was born in the United States.

02:43:18
<transcript>: but her parents

02:43:29
<transcript>: But her parents lived in Mexico, came into America, had her. I'm sorry. I botched all that she speaks fluent Spanish and English. So we're gonna make her speak Spanish around the house so that our kids can pick it up.

02:43:29
<transcript>: but that

02:43:32
dayallnash: have you even met your wife?

02:43:35
<transcript>: But that won't help you. Because I still don't know Spanish. I'm sorry. I could have said no. I don't speak Spanish.

02:43:35
<transcript>: this

02:43:41
<transcript>: This would be cool. I'm intimidating. A Tobis is intimidating for the Noob, it really is.

02:43:52
<transcript>: There's a stigma around how complex it is, and I get it. But I think a lot of webdevs would really enjoy all those tools at their disposal if they just knew it was more approachable than it seems.

02:43:56
<transcript>: Imp for T. Thank you for the follow. I really appreciate that follow.

02:43:56
<transcript>: remember

02:44:06
<transcript>: Remember seeing Nas on Hacker News a while ago. Didn't know as you. Oh, it was on Hacker News. Really? I don't really hang out on hacker news because I said one thing one time and they were very mean to me.

02:44:06
<transcript>: i can't handle that

02:44:08
2dorkstv: to me, AWS just names everything so poorly. It's difficult to figure out what you need

02:44:19
<transcript>: I can't handle that. Doesn't Versaille do the same thing. Deploy next to us on AWS. It does. Yeah, it does. Everything is just built on AWS. That's why everyone should learn AWS, because it's all this built on it. It's the building blocks, right.

02:44:25
<transcript>: Instaf Whoo I was thinking of you and Sluff when I said the Atabest employees that are here.

02:44:30
<transcript>: Difference is you can't get it the underlying infrared verselle exactly.

02:44:30
wesleycoder: @2DorksTV true

02:44:33
instafluff: maayaLOL

02:44:40
<transcript>: Wesley. That will blow my mind. I'm sure I'm stuck on this promising month now not being able to push next to us forward on my job because of deploy problems. Is the pain in my ass or paint on my ass? It's a pain on your ass.

02:44:40
<transcript>: or in your

02:44:42
<transcript>: Or in your ass.

02:44:47
<transcript>: If you ever met have you even met your wife.

02:44:49
<transcript>: What.

02:44:50
texoport: And Vercel's pricing looks very sus

02:44:52
<transcript>: Have I even met my wife.

02:44:52
<transcript>: they

02:45:00
<transcript>: They all welcome. Welcome to Chat. What do you mean? They all Nash? Have I even met my wife? I have met my wife.

02:45:02
<transcript>: What do you mean.

02:45:07
<transcript>: Aws, just names? Everything so poorly? It's difficult to figure out what you need? Yeah.

02:45:08
caldotjs: @2DorksTV this! we need a aws service - human language translator

02:45:10
<transcript>: That's definitely a common criticism.

02:45:11
wesleycoder: I dunno, my english is so bad in my ass, on my ass, dunno :S

02:45:11
dayallnash: you don't seem to know where she comes from

02:45:18
<transcript>: For sales pricing with very Cess. Yeah, Versaille.

02:45:18
<transcript>: is

02:45:23
<transcript>: Is it gets expensive quickly as soon as you don't have just like.

02:45:23
<transcript>: a playground thing

02:45:24
<transcript>: A playground thing.

02:45:24
<transcript>: when you have a real

02:45:27
<transcript>: When you have a real thing, it gets expensive.

02:45:27
<transcript>: this

02:45:29
delvoid: All i know about AWS is it likes to send suprise bills

02:45:30
<transcript>: This. We need an AWS Service, human language translator.

02:45:33
nexxeln: he was talking about his wife's best friend @dayallnash

02:45:35
caldotjs: @dayallnash his wifes best friend was the person he was talking about

02:45:37
<transcript>: Your English is so bad in my ass on ass. No, you're fine.

02:45:37
<transcript>: you're good

02:45:37
silverdezign: hello hello you sure you met your wife? :D what a weird question

02:45:38
<transcript>: You're good.

02:45:38
<transcript>: i

02:45:43
2dorkstv: @2DorksTV right? EC2, RDS, S3 = vms, db, storage :P

02:45:45
<transcript>: I mean, look at you, Wesley. You know multiple languages, so you don't need to apologize.

02:45:45
<transcript>: you don't

02:45:49
<transcript>: You don't seem to know where she comes from. Oh, no. I was talking about my wife's best friend.

02:45:49
<transcript>: sorry

02:45:53
<transcript>: Sorry, my wife's best friend is moving in with us in January.

02:45:53
<transcript>: she

02:45:59
brunooomelo: !t3

02:45:59
<transcript>: She is from Mexico. Kind of her parents are from Mexico. She knows Spanish.

02:46:10
<transcript>: All I know about AWS is it likes to send surprise bills. See, double it. That's exactly my point. That is like there are three, like, common.

02:46:10
<transcript>: immediate

02:46:15
<transcript>: Immediate thoughts that people who don't use AWS have when they hear AWS, one.

02:46:15
<transcript>: lots of

02:46:36
<transcript>: Lots of services too complex. Two. Oh, yeah. I'll get, like, a $40,000 bill in the mail. And then I'm just screwed like that's. Everyone thinks that. And then three. And because of, like, from Reddit Threads. And I get it like that happened to some people. But like, there are plenty of easy ways to prevent that from happening. And those are exceptional cases where I'm positive. Aws works.

02:46:36
<transcript>: with those customers

02:46:37
<transcript>: With those customers.

02:46:43
<transcript>: And work with them where they didn't have to actually pay $40,000. I'm positive.

02:46:43
<transcript>: did i hear

02:46:57
<transcript>: Did I hear that from them? No, but I'm just positive. Okay. Those are very extreme cases where, like a divers isn't gonna send you 400 hour bill if you don't accidentally run some really extensive VM for days or month or whatever, like people did things.

02:46:57
<transcript>: accidentally

02:47:04
texoport: I've been using GCP for a bit and I've noticed that the cli experience was a lot better than AWS. That, and the GCP npm libraries feel a lot cleaner and have up to date dependencies.

02:47:17
<transcript>: Accidentally to create those huge bills. It's a learning opportunity. But it's not like they had to go bankrupt. And AWS came after this car or whatever. Like any of us worked with them. I'm sure of it. But because of those few isolated instances and those huge red threads that blew up, now everyone is just terrified. They're gonna get a surprise bill, you won't get a surprise bill.

02:47:28
cazcik: can't you just dockerize nextjs and throw it at ECS or something?

02:47:31
<transcript>: If you have any guidance whatsoever and I'm here to help you, I'm here to help you get on AWS and not be afraid of your bill. Just build with serverless tech if you just like create an SCP that eliminates.

02:47:43
<transcript>: 200 services and you can only use these dozen services. You do not have to worry about your bill. I promise. The only reason you'd have to worry about your bill is if you build something hugely successful, it gets tons of traffic and usage.

02:47:43
<transcript>: and then

02:47:45
<transcript>: And then that's a good problem to have.

02:47:45
<transcript>: okay

02:47:47
<transcript>: Okay, I gotta keep moving.

02:47:49
<transcript>: And.

02:47:52
<transcript>: Hello? Hello? You sure you miss.

02:47:57
<transcript>: Right EC, Two RDS, Three VMs DB storage.

02:48:02
delvoid: Honestly, other then seeing posts about suprise bills. I have never looked at aws. So excited to see you build your tool to see what it can do

02:48:08
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Bruno. Mellow. I'm just talking. I'm not coding anymore. I'm just a talker. I should just start using the Gist. Chatting like that's what prime does, right? I'm just chatting.

02:48:08
<transcript>: t three

02:48:17
<transcript>: T three. Bruno, the T three. Stack. Look it up. T three, GD. No, T three. I don't know. Create T three GG. Maybe.

02:48:17
<transcript>: somebody

02:48:28
<transcript>: Somebody point in the right direction. I'm using GCP for a bit. I noticed that the CLI experience was a lot better than AWS at and the GCP MPM libraries feel like a lot cleaner. Have updated dependencies.

02:48:28
<transcript>: that may be

02:48:32
<transcript>: That may be the Google may have a better beat on like.

02:48:32
<transcript>: developer

02:48:33
delvoid: @brunooomelo https://create.t3.gg/

02:48:34
<transcript>: Developer ergonomics.

02:48:37
silverdezign: but why AWS instead of DigitalOcean for small app seems less complex ?

02:48:42
<transcript>: I think a Tobis services I would lean towards. So I used I do use Google cloud for like a few things.

02:48:46
nexxeln: yep that link

02:48:48
<transcript>: So mostly just ml stuff like a Tobis has plugged.

02:48:48
<transcript>: on the

02:49:02
<transcript>: On the Ml front both like, do it yourself and prepackaged for use case Ml stuff. But like, Google speech stuff is just better. I think personally, I just think they do a lot of the speech Ml stuff better.

02:49:02
<transcript>: some of the vision

02:49:09
<transcript>: Some of the Vision Ml stuff. They're probably a little better. I think they've just add more experience and time building that stuff.

02:49:09
<transcript>: so i think just

02:49:18
<transcript>: So I think just generally broadstrokes their Ml stuff is good. I've used GCP just for that even when I'm using AWS for everything else.

02:49:27
<transcript>: There's times where I do that, but that's not multicloud. And please don't do multicloud. That's a dumb word. Just ignore it. If you ever hear someone say multicloud, just tune it out.

02:49:30
<transcript>: Cats Kick welcome to chat.

02:49:30
<transcript>: can't you just

02:49:35
<transcript>: Can't you just dockerize next JS and throw it at Ecstas or something? Yes, you definitely can.

02:49:40
<transcript>: The problem is I don't really like Docker.

02:49:45
<transcript>: I mean, I I don't want to go too hard on the containerization thing.

02:49:49
<transcript>: You have to know my use case is like.

02:49:54
<transcript>: Startups Greenfield projects Working with very small teams.

02:49:58
<transcript>: And for that purpose I just lean towards serverless stuff.

02:50:01
cowfacedude99: I have been throwing stuff on DO for years. AWS/GCP/Azure kind of feel too complicated for me

02:50:10
<transcript>: And I know there's like overlap with containers and serverless. And like Fargate as a deployment method. Like there are ways to do serverlessy things with containers, but generally.

02:50:10
<transcript>: i

02:50:13
<transcript>: I try not to run Docker on my machine.

02:50:13
<transcript>: and i know

02:50:30
<transcript>: And I know that's a big draw. If you're writing stuff with containers, you can just spin up Docker on your machine and run your Dev environment just like the thing runs in Prod or whatever. I don't like running Docker. I just don't. And that's an immediate nonstarter for me. If I have to run Docs or to run the Thing, I'm out.

02:50:37
instafluff: me neither!! docker is so heavy starletBleh

02:50:42
instafluff: at least on windows

02:50:43
<transcript>: I'm sorry, Mandy. If you're here, I know, I know you're big into it and there's. It's not wrong. Like I'm not saying Docker and containers are bad. I'm not saying Kubernetes is bad. I'm saying.

02:50:43
<transcript>: those things

02:50:47
<transcript>: Those things aren't for me in my use cases, in my personal preferences.

02:50:50
<transcript>: Doesn't mean it's not for you.

02:50:50
<transcript>: i

02:51:04
<transcript>: I've been seeing posts about surprise bills. I have never looked at ABS. So excited to see you build your tools. See what I can do? Cool now, void. I'm happy to hear it. Create T three GGS. Right, but y a Tobs instead of Digital Ocean for small apps seems less complex.

02:51:04
<transcript>: i guess my

02:51:07
<transcript>: I guess my question would be Why Digital ocean.

02:51:10
<transcript>: In not like.

02:51:10
<transcript>: versail

02:51:14
<transcript>: Versaille or fly or like the depending on what you're deploying.

02:51:14
<transcript>: i feel like there's

02:51:15
instafluff: that's true, it's really nice for CI/CD and testing

02:51:18
<transcript>: I feel like there's things even higher level abstraction than digital lotion.

02:51:21
texoport: I've just been using a bunch of scripts using rsync for deployments for a bit and it's been working great, and pushing changes to prod is so fast. I know I'll have to do something better later, but it works great for now.

02:51:24
<transcript>: But like to me, I use AWS for all of the lowlevel, primitives.

02:51:24
<transcript>: they're always

02:51:44
<transcript>: They're always going to be stable and backward compatible, like they don't ship breaking changes. These are amazing primitives to build on. And they're these building blocks that as you learn them, you learn to assemble them all these combinations and patterns that make really robust apps. And that there's no other offering in the closest would be Azure GCP.

02:51:47
<transcript>: I just prefer to be less.

02:51:47
<transcript>: probably for the same reason

02:51:51
<transcript>: Probably for the same reason. I prefer react because they've got like.

02:51:51
<transcript>: the

02:51:56
<transcript>: The largest ecosystem, right and most people using it.

02:51:56
2dorkstv: I like containers when collaborating. There's no "it doesn't work on my laptop" kind of arguments. All the dependencies are bundled in the image

02:51:59
cowfacedude99: mainly because I had free credit on DO for 4 years....

02:52:16
<transcript>: Okay, let's see. I'm trying to catch up here on chat. That link. I've been throwing stuff on digital ocean for years. Aws. Gcp Azure. Kind of feel too complicated for me. That's totally common cafe. That's what I'm trying to help. I'm trying to help some percentage of those people that feel that way to feel less, like they couldn't approach. Aws, if you can understand.

02:52:16
<transcript>: react

02:52:17
<transcript>: React.

02:52:17
<transcript>: you can

02:52:19
nexxeln: azure LUL

02:52:26
<transcript>: You can understand. Aws, I think the thing that, like another problem is everyone hears about 300 services or 200 plus services or whatever they hear.

02:52:26
<transcript>: and

02:52:47
<transcript>: And that just feels like too much. But honestly, I use, like, a dozen. There's, like, a dozen services that you use every day. And you just learn them really fast. And then you have that at your disposal. Like, once you know how to work with that three, all of your image uploading, all of your whatever you want to do with file uploads, you just have that in your back pocket. You know how to do it.

02:52:47
<transcript>: now

02:52:48
instafluff: i use... lightsail LUL

02:52:49
<transcript>: Now you know how to build that.

02:52:55
<transcript>: Docker so heavy I agree. At least on Windows, same on the Mac.

02:53:10
<transcript>: I've just been using a bunch of scripts using our sync for deployments for a bit. It's been working great, pushing changes to product so fast. I know I'll have to do something better later, but we're now that's the thing about tech. You can just do the thing that's great for now and then when it's not great anymore.

02:53:10
<transcript>: to grow out of it

02:53:12
<transcript>: To grow out of it. You do something else.

02:53:14
<transcript>: I love tech.

02:53:23
<transcript>: I caught up. I use LightSail. Hey, Lacto works.

02:53:28
<transcript>: Is that mostly like deploying WordPress sites. Is that light set.

02:53:28
<transcript>: i know

02:53:38
<transcript>: I know there's a lot of stuff I get on a Tobis IQ, which is like a marketplace for freelance work. And I know lots of people want help with LightSail. So that's how I know about, like, so.

02:53:43
<transcript>: Okay. I think we can actually write code now, if we wanted to do we want to.

02:53:43
<transcript>: i want to

02:53:44
<transcript>: I want to.

02:53:47
<transcript>: Where we at coming up on 3 hours.

02:53:47
<transcript>: still got another

02:53:50
<transcript>: Still got another hour or two.

02:54:02
<transcript>: Let's what can we finish? I need to finish something on this. Aw, guess it's really it's Dragon on right now we have this bug where it seems like we don't answer like two questions, and then it breaks.

02:54:06
<transcript>: Seems like an important one to fix.

02:54:14
<transcript>: Thank you for the follows. A one and strawberry, strawberry, strawberry armpit. That's a funny name. I like that.

02:54:15
texoport: Are you using TRPC v10?

02:54:16
instafluff: it's basically a fixed-price super cheap vm so i just boot up nodejs instances for $3.5/mo

02:54:18
piq9117: As part of your introduction, do you say "I'm an AWS DevTools Hero"? Kappa

02:54:25
<transcript>: Alright new game that is outsink. This is probably my favorite day to be a service right here. That's the first time I've gotten it on my little game.

02:54:28
<transcript>: What is this? What is this.

02:54:28
<transcript>: iot

02:54:30
<transcript>: Iot things graph. I think.

02:54:32
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:54:37
<transcript>: That's gonna be FSX FSX for something.

02:54:41
<transcript>: That's one of the databases. Neptune.

02:54:43
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:54:43
<transcript>: we could

02:54:52
<transcript>: We could make this a lot harder if we said, like, we choose services with the same in the same family. We gotta do that. What is this? Oh, marketplace.

02:54:54
instafluff: :O this is really hard

02:54:55
<transcript>: Of course.

02:54:57
<transcript>: Direct connect.

02:54:57
<transcript>: right

02:55:06
<transcript>: Right. Ah, see, there it's broken. It didn't actually fire off the answer mutation. So let's look at that code. Where is that? Right.

02:55:10
<transcript>: Handle. Answer. That's. This right here.

02:55:10
<transcript>: so if

02:55:13
<transcript>: So if not currently round return.

02:55:13
<transcript>: if

02:55:16
<transcript>: If answer mutation is Loading.

02:55:16
<transcript>: return

02:55:18
<transcript>: Return.

02:55:18
<transcript>: i

02:55:20
<transcript>: I think I need to remove that.

02:55:22
<transcript>: Think.

02:55:22
<transcript>: i think

02:55:34
<transcript>: I think I messed up somewhere. Let's try that. Let's see if we can answer like ten in a row now, without it breaking. Oh, it should be actually giving us a score. Now this is Kinesis. Something. Data streams.

02:55:34
<transcript>: so

02:55:42
<transcript>: So see, like, right there. That would have been so much harder. That question was so much harder. If one of the other Kinesis services was listed, then I had to actually think about it.

02:55:47
<transcript>: Time.

02:55:52
<transcript>: What is this? This is.

02:55:52
<transcript>: ef

02:56:00
<transcript>: Efs. Is that the EFS logo? I don't know. I guess. Process of elimination. It didn't work. You see that.

02:56:03
<transcript>: Oh.

02:56:05
<transcript>: Bother.

02:56:08
<transcript>: The Reference? Anybody.

02:56:15
<transcript>: Why? Why is that button not fine, let's just log every time the button is clicked.

02:56:15
instafluff: part of me is like "can i just train a NN to guess these for me" maayaLOL

02:56:23
<transcript>: Where is the button here on click on and.

02:56:32
<transcript>: It'll answer.

02:56:34
nexxeln: maybe try just mutate not mutateAsync

02:56:44
<transcript>: Console, log.

02:56:49
<transcript>: Let's just do that.

02:56:54
<transcript>: Just try mutate, not mutate. A sync? Oh.

02:56:57
<transcript>: Let me come right back to that next.

02:56:57
<transcript>: am

02:57:02
<transcript>: Am I using tierpc version ten? No. I feel like I should since it was so.

02:57:02
<transcript>: it's just put out

02:57:12
<transcript>: It's just put out there right in beta. So like I should be using the new thing. Maybe we'll do that at some point we'll switch over. Thanks for the follow a Monty.

02:57:12
<transcript>: and stat

02:57:14
<transcript>: And stattered.

02:57:14
<transcript>: thank you so much

02:57:21
<transcript>: Thank you so much for your follows. I love when I get new follows. You know why I love it? Because I assume that means you're gonna come back.

02:57:21
<transcript>: and people

02:57:28
<transcript>: And people that have they just keep coming back. I get to know them better. They chat. We get to know each other. It feels good.

02:57:28
<transcript>: to have

02:57:30
<transcript>: To have you around.

02:57:30
<transcript>: and the more i get to know

02:57:38
<transcript>: And the more I get to know you, the more I like to see you show back up. So I feel like when you follow me, that's like the first step towards we're building something here.

02:57:38
<transcript>: menu

02:57:42
<transcript>: Menu We're kind of starting a relationship.

02:57:42
<transcript>: so please

02:57:43
<transcript>: So please do come back.

02:57:43
<transcript>: it's basically

02:58:01
<transcript>: It's basically a fixed price, super cheap VM. So I just boot up node JS instances for 350 a month. Oh, nice. Okay, so that's so light Sail doesn't have to be WordPress. You can just boot up a light cell node JS instance. Cool. Welcome to Chat Pick as part of your introduction, do you say I'm an AWS Dev tool hero.

02:58:01
<transcript>: my

02:58:04
<transcript>: My introduction? Yeah.

02:58:09
nexxeln: you can do set up a t3 app with trpc v10 using npx create-t3-app@next

02:58:11
<transcript>: What do you mean? Like when I meet someone in person, that kind of introduction. Because in that case, no, I don't say anything.

02:58:11
<transcript>: about tech

02:58:15
<transcript>: About Tech, because around here I live in the Ozarks and.

02:58:15
<transcript>: basically

02:58:17
amonteirom: Hello, I speak here from Brazil. I'm a developer and I'm watching your live to improve my understanding in English

02:58:19
<transcript>: Basically the thing I say to people and they're like, what do you do.

02:58:19
<transcript>: stuff with computers

02:58:35
<transcript>: Stuff with computers, because honestly, that's as far as it goes, the occasional person will say, oh, really? Me too. What do you do? And I'm like, oh, I do. So with software, and they'll be like, oh, I'm an It person at the hospital or whatever. That's where most of it. If it's gonna go further than just computers, that's where it gets.

02:58:35
<transcript>: the very

02:58:45
<transcript>: The very rare case where it's another developer we get into. Oh, I've been software, too. What do you. What do you do? Oh, and then I'm like, I don't know what I do. I do a lot of things.

02:58:45
<transcript>: most

02:58:58
instafluff: yupyup lightsail is just any vm images but they have a better custom UI that's less confusing than the aws console

02:59:01
<transcript>: Mostly JavaScript and AWS. And then usually they don't know anybody to be s all that said my neighbor two doors down. So I live in the Ozarks. I don't know if in 100 miles radius if there are a thousand people that know at AWS is there probably aren't.

02:59:01
<transcript>: but

02:59:16
instafluff: ooooh

02:59:21
<transcript>: But my neighbor two doors down, Ben. Hey, Ben. Ben Ellis. He's he's in AWS. And we get to go on walks every week. So I have one person kind of near me. We get to talk about AWS. Like we brainstorm, architectures, things we want to build. We talk about the freelance. He's also a freelancer. He's going through all the certs.

02:59:26
<transcript>: Like he's another me. Just two doors down. So I have that.

02:59:28
<transcript>: What was the question.

02:59:35
<transcript>: Why is there an invisible hat on my head? I really don't like what it does. That I don't know. It's not green. Why does it do that.

02:59:40
<transcript>: I don't know, but I'm gonna put my glasses on instead.

02:59:40
<transcript>: this is

02:59:41
dnbull: Lol, in general i dont think people know what AWS is. Actually anything web dev not many people know. Just the usual buzz word "html"

02:59:46
<transcript>: This is really hard. Part of me is like, can I just train a neural net to get things because he's for me.

02:59:57
<transcript>: We're gonna make it harder, Fluff. We're gonna make it even harder by making we're gonna always have one option with it. That's the same family of services.

02:59:57
<transcript>: that's a challenge

03:00:04
piq9117: SeemsGood

03:00:05
<transcript>: That's a challenge because I don't have the family of services currently in my database. My little like list of services, but we'll figure it out.

03:00:05
<transcript>: okay

03:00:09
dnbull: I do the same thing and I live in a city, " I do stuff w computers"

03:00:09
<transcript>: Okay. So next says try mutate. Not mutate. Async.

03:00:09
<transcript>: you

03:00:14
<transcript>: You can do setup a T three app with PrPC version ten oh you can.

03:00:17
<transcript>: Next I'm gonna have to start over.

03:00:17
<transcript>: we're starting over

03:00:20
<transcript>: We're starting over. Everybody. No.

03:00:20
<transcript>: i mean start

03:00:22
delvoid: Blur the image make it harder

03:00:31
instafluff: expert level quiz instafThink this is like who wants to be an awsillionaire

03:00:38
<transcript>: I mean, start over, but bring all the code over, but I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do a new Create T Three app just to see version Ten added in there. You're on top of it. Next. Were you, like working on it before he announced before Alex, like announced the version in beta. Did you have, like, an early preview or something, or did you just work on it as soon as he announced that that's fast.

03:00:45
<transcript>: Nika coder. Thank you for the follow. Nikka. I appreciate that. Why can't I put the glasses on my head.

03:00:45
<transcript>: i

03:00:50
nexxeln: yeah we even had v10 alpha in t3 app lol

03:00:52
texoport: Sachin wrote a codemod which you could try. I was writing my own but then found his

03:00:52
<transcript>: I don't there we go I'm just not loving not loving the hat when it's all transparent on the head.

03:00:55
nexxeln: yes i had early access

03:00:57
ajcwebdev: 10 has been in the works for like half a year lol

03:01:00
<transcript>: Welcome to Chadamonte. Hello. I speak here from Brazil. I'm a developer, and I'm watching your live to improve my understanding in English. Well, I hope I help you.

03:01:00
<transcript>: i do

03:01:04
<transcript>: I do speak English. Maybe not the best Speaker.

03:01:04
<transcript>: i failed public

03:01:07
wesleycoder: Brazil gang!

03:01:07
<transcript>: I failed public speaking three times in College. True story.

03:01:07
<transcript>: but

03:01:12
<transcript>: But I do speak English, so I hope that I can help you with that as well.

03:01:12
<transcript>: my sales

03:01:19
<transcript>: My sales just any VM image to have better customi. That's less confusing this console. That sounds nice. I need to play with it.

03:01:20
nexxeln: they were inviting anyone to give feedback

03:01:27
<transcript>: General I don't think people know what a Tobis is actually anything web Dev. Not many people know just the usual buzzword. Html.

03:01:27
<transcript>: you're probably

03:01:34
<transcript>: You're probably right. I do the same thing. And I live in a city. I do stuff with computers. That's the only universal thing I can say that I know they'll understand.

03:01:34
<transcript>: and then

03:01:38
<transcript>: And then and then it's like, oh, well.

03:01:38
<transcript>: ever

03:01:42
<transcript>: Everett, the head of the POA. He's got a problem with his printer. Do you think you could help him with that.

03:01:47
<transcript>: And then I regret ever saying anything about computers.

03:01:47
<transcript>: did i

03:01:52
<transcript>: Did I say computers? I'm actually a gardener. I'm a professional gardener.

03:01:57
whoa_dood: PC Load Letter !?

03:02:02
<transcript>: Image makes it harder. Blur the image OOH that would make it harder, but I think it's hard enough to avoid even when you see the image. It's hard enough to know what the service is. There's a lot of them.

03:02:05
<transcript>: Like who wants to be an athlete in there.

03:02:08
<transcript>: That's funny.

03:02:08
<transcript>: we had

03:02:11
daeeyy: coding is sometimes a lot like gardening

03:02:11
<transcript>: We had we even had version Alpha and T three app.

03:02:13
<transcript>: Oh really.

03:02:16
<transcript>: Nice. Yeah. I just didn't know this.

03:02:16
<transcript>: section

03:02:21
<transcript>: Section wrote a code mod. He's been working on version Tim for a while. I think right.

03:02:21
<transcript>: cod

03:02:24
<transcript>: Cod. Which you could try. I was riding my own, but then found his.

03:02:34
<transcript>: Tin has been the works for like half a year. Yeah. I guess it didn't just sneak up on it. It just finally, like publicly said, like, you can use it now, right.

03:02:38
<transcript>: Wesley's from Brazil as well. They were inviting anyone to get feedback.

03:02:41
<transcript>: Pc Load letter.

03:02:45
<transcript>: Okay.

03:02:45
<transcript>: i caught up in chat

03:02:46
<transcript>: I caught up in chat.

03:02:50
<transcript>: What are we doing.

03:02:50
<transcript>: what we done here

03:02:52
<transcript>: What we done here. We're trying to.

03:02:56
<transcript>: Fix a bug.

03:03:00
<transcript>: We had a bug now we're gonna log choice so we can see.

03:03:04
texoport: Why do you think my name is "tech support" lol. Everyone around me uses me as free tech support, sigh

03:03:05
<transcript>: The choice printed out. That's what it's that.

03:03:11
<transcript>: Migration Service. Yes. Yeah. It's like you're migrating to the cloud.

03:03:18
<transcript>: Oh, what is this? I don't know. Contractory. Oh, God.

03:03:18
<transcript>: sometimes

03:03:22
<transcript>: Sometimes you just guess when you get it right you know that's something with shield in it.

03:03:24
<transcript>: Guard duty.

03:03:26
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:03:30
<transcript>: I don't know.

03:03:33
<transcript>: Oh, elemental server.

03:03:33
<transcript>: manage

03:03:35
<transcript>: Manager.

03:03:38
<transcript>: That's gonna be worked off.

03:03:38
<transcript>: seeing that

03:03:44
<transcript>: Seeing that one a couple times. I didn't know about that service until I saw it on my game. This is very educational.

03:03:45
<transcript>: Sword.

03:03:47
<transcript>: Connect.

03:03:47
<transcript>: okay

03:03:48
<transcript>: Okay.

03:03:48
<transcript>: i guess

03:03:50
<transcript>: I guess.

03:03:55
<transcript>: Look out first. Equipment. Look out for equipment.

03:04:05
<transcript>: Systems manager.

03:04:05
<transcript>: now pan

03:04:07
<transcript>: Now, Panorama.

03:04:12
<transcript>: Oh, I know this one API gateway. Easy. Oh, there's our bug. Do you see that.

03:04:12
<transcript>: okay

03:04:14
<transcript>: Okay. So.

03:04:14
<transcript>: why oh it's

03:04:16
<transcript>: Why? Oh, it's not even logging.

03:04:16
<transcript>: did i not

03:04:18
<transcript>: Did I not save the file.

03:04:22
<transcript>: Not logging the choice when we click handle.

03:04:27
<transcript>: It didn't log any of them, though.

03:04:27
<transcript>: i just never

03:04:30
<transcript>: I just never saw any of those log, right.

03:04:34
<transcript>: That's something with Sage Maker augmented AI.

03:04:34
<transcript>: augment

03:04:36
<transcript>: Augmented out there it is.

03:04:38
wesleycoder: this looks so fun to play: ship it, publish it, we wanna try it we don't mind it has bugs, everything has bugs

03:04:39
<transcript>: Honeycoat.

03:04:42
<transcript>: Okay. Oh, I got it wrong, though? Device farm.

03:04:42
<transcript>: system

03:04:45
<transcript>: Systems manager.

03:04:51
<transcript>: Systems Manager cool. It is logging. I just wasn't seeing it.

03:04:51
<transcript>: neuron maybe

03:04:57
<transcript>: Neuron. Maybe no IoT. One click. We got to get one that doesn't work. Athena. I know that one.

03:04:57
<transcript>: cena

03:04:59
<transcript>: Cena.

03:05:06
<transcript>: What is this? Billing? Conductor? I don't know. Sync box. Crakatoa.

03:05:08
<transcript>: That's code, deploy.

03:05:10
<transcript>: Still working.

03:05:10
<transcript>: can you

03:05:12
<transcript>: Can you fire hose.

03:05:18
<transcript>: Is that extra cloud search.

03:05:29
<transcript>: Did we fix the bug by adding a console log line? Maybe I need to wait till it gets further into the Thing Fleetwise. I don't know. Iot core.

03:05:32
<transcript>: What is this one.

03:05:35
<transcript>: Oh, you know what I think under the issue.

03:05:42
<transcript>: Management console thanks for the follow of Blakes.

03:05:47
<transcript>: Okay. There it is. That's the problem. I know the problem. We figured out everybody.

03:06:00
<transcript>: Oh, I should probably see it work before I say that. Thanks for the follow. Finesse, finesse, prints. Why do I keep getting this? Did someone else put the Howdy partner on my head again? Where is it coming from.

03:06:02
<transcript>: Trolling me.

03:06:08
<transcript>: Pajama Cam. Thanks for the follow opening pajamas. Pajama can.

03:06:16
<transcript>: It's my topic. Still say I guess we'll use X eight now we're not doing that now.

03:06:20
<transcript>: We're not doing that. Why do you think my name is Tech support.

03:06:24
<transcript>: Everyone around me uses me three tech support. Yeah.

03:06:27
<transcript>: That's life as a technologist.

03:06:34
<transcript>: Looks so fun to play. Ship it. Publish it. We want to try it. Okay. You don't mind if it has bugs? Everything has Bucks. That's right. We're shipping it today.

03:06:38
<transcript>: Today we're shipping it topic.

03:06:43
<transcript>: Building AW guess.

03:06:43
wesleycoder: whooohoooo

03:06:45
adamdotdev: !topic building awguess, WE'RE SHIPPING IT TODAY

03:06:47
<transcript>: We're shipping it today.

03:06:49
<transcript>: What are you? Here first.

03:07:01
<transcript>: Chipping it. We're gonna publish this thing. We've already bought 80 Viewgues.com. We're ready. Okay, let's do it. We gotta get to work. I think I know the issue, though. I think the issue is.

03:07:04
<transcript>: Unexpired. I think it's expiring.

03:07:04
<transcript>: and never

03:07:08
<transcript>: And never setting expired to false.

03:07:08
<transcript>: fear

03:07:17
<transcript>: Fear. So if final equals. Oh, because that just keeps going. The timer just keeps on going. We need to do something else here.

03:07:20
<transcript>: Let's see on expired.

03:07:27
<transcript>: We want to fire it one time, but this use effect is going to keep on chugging this interval here.

03:07:31
<transcript>: It's like we need to break out of the interval.

03:07:31
<transcript>: or

03:07:34
<transcript>: Or up here, we need to say.

03:07:34
<transcript>: if

03:07:36
<transcript>: If.

03:07:36
<transcript>: final

03:07:40
<transcript>: Final. Now final isn't the thing. It's elapsed. So here.

03:07:41
wesleycoder: onExpired => clearInterval

03:07:49
<transcript>: That means we're gonna rerun this every time Elapsed changes that's no good.

03:07:49
<transcript>: how do i

03:07:53
<transcript>: How do I want to think about this? I don't want to think about this. Timer.

03:07:56
<transcript>: On expired clear interval.

03:08:01
<transcript>: Yeah, I guess we could then it'll get re.

03:08:03
<transcript>: You're a genius, Wesley. Thank you so much.

03:08:07
<transcript>: So, yeah, we just clear interval here.

03:08:11
<transcript>: And you'll get paid back up.

03:08:15
<transcript>: When the round changes, yeah, when the round changes.

03:08:15
<transcript>: just like

03:08:17
<transcript>: Just like that.

03:08:17
<transcript>: at the time

03:08:19
<transcript>: At the timer when it expires.

03:08:19
<transcript>: love it

03:08:21
<transcript>: Love it.

03:08:21
<transcript>: of course

03:08:24
<transcript>: Of course. Okay. Here we go.

03:08:24
<transcript>: shouldn't

03:08:31
<transcript>: Shouldn't see that bug anymore. I can reproduce that bug really easily now because I just had to wait till it's almost expired and then do it.

03:08:34
<transcript>: I think my timer is a little delayed, actually.

03:08:34
<transcript>: this

03:08:40
<transcript>: This DevOps guru. I don't know. Yeah. Okay. Now the next one, it won't let me answer. Watch.

03:08:45
<transcript>: See? Oh, it. That means it doesn't work. That means my fix didn't work.

03:08:48
<transcript>: Well, that's a bummer.

03:08:48
<transcript>: that needs a

03:08:49
wesleycoder: sad

03:08:51
<transcript>: That needs a refresh the page already refresh it.

03:08:51
<transcript>: clear interval

03:08:54
<transcript>: Clear interval. Don't do something wrong here.

03:08:54
<transcript>: clear interval

03:08:56
<transcript>: Clear interval handle.

03:08:58
<transcript>: On expire.

03:09:05
<transcript>: If choice equals undefined, set labs to final.

03:09:12
<transcript>: Then we stop the timer. Right. Clear interval handle.

03:09:14
<transcript>: What's the problem.

03:09:17
<transcript>: Shouldn't that work.

03:09:23
<transcript>: Let's log every time this runs, so console log.

03:09:23
<transcript>: did it

03:09:25
<transcript>: Did it.

03:09:28
<transcript>: Did it. We did it.

03:09:33
<transcript>: 's Gonna Work, it's Gonna work.

03:09:33
<transcript>: just hang on

03:09:37
<transcript>: Just hang on so when it hits expired, it should only log that one.

03:09:41
<transcript>: It did it twice.

03:09:44
<transcript>: I.

03:09:57
<transcript>: Slap in the face. React. Just slaps you in the face like you're wrong. You're doing it wrong. And I'm like, no use. Effect is wrong. It's dumb. It does dumb stuff.

03:09:59
<transcript>: I'm getting it. I'm gonna get a little upset.

03:09:59
<transcript>: so

03:10:02
<transcript>: So, what's? It clear.

03:10:11
<transcript>: So they put the strict mode in there so you're like everything you do in here, should just be okay to run any number of times.

03:10:11
<transcript>: i

03:10:17
<transcript>: I have code that can't just run any number of times. So then what? Then what do I do? React.

03:10:17
<transcript>: someone tell me

03:10:23
<transcript>: Someone tell me no, really, someone tell me does anyone know what should I do when I the only one that's run once.

03:10:32
wesleycoder: Found the cause of the bug  Remove the react dependency and replace with solid

03:10:35
<transcript>: Is that even the problem, though I don't know that the problem is. Oh yeah, it is because on expired runs twice and that means now expired is just set indefinitely.

03:10:41
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:10:47
nexxeln: truee @wesleycoder

03:10:47
<transcript>: Handling expired.

03:10:52
<transcript>: Handle expired.

03:10:52
<transcript>: we're gonna do

03:10:54
<transcript>: We're gonna do the new round now.

03:10:56
<transcript>: It looks hard. Okay.

03:11:04
<transcript>: So created a new round. Oh, it did it twice. Oh, it did it so many times. Okay, this is clearly not what we want.

03:11:07
<transcript>: Figure this out.

03:11:11
<transcript>: So what we're gonna do? We're gonna ship it even before we have leaders.

03:11:11
<transcript>: we're just gonna

03:11:20
<transcript>: We're just gonna ship it so you guys can play with it and we'll builderboards after that. So your score is in the early going will just be for fun piece. How about that.

03:11:20
aminunes: This guy is a god or a psyco cause programing in neovim can only be one of that options

03:11:25
<transcript>: Sound the cause of the bug. Remove the react dependency in a place of salad.

03:11:34
<transcript>: Ammune. Welcome to chat. This guy is a God or psycho because programming a new mkhealth.

03:11:38
<transcript>: I don't think I'm either of those things.

03:11:42
theprimeagen: woah

03:11:44
<transcript>: Thank you for the following anyway, even though you're not sure if you're following a God or a psycho.

03:11:52
<transcript>: Neil Vin's great. It's like, I mean, it's just vim. Really. The vim part is.

03:11:52
<transcript>: the part

03:12:03
<transcript>: The part that's great. Neil BIM is fun. Neil Vim gives you a new hobby. If you want to take a little more ownership of your development environment is teach calls it the Personnel Development environment.

03:12:03
aminunes: Im following a guy that knows t3 stack so

03:12:08
<transcript>: That's what that's about? Whoa, primes. Here.

03:12:16
<transcript>: I'm following a guy that knows T three stacks. So this is T. Three stack. We're building this with P three stack.

03:12:19
<transcript>: Got issues.

03:12:24
<transcript>: We've got issues. Prime.

03:12:24
<transcript>: we're trying to sort

03:12:26
<transcript>: We're trying to sort them out.

03:12:32
<transcript>: So part of the issue is the effect. The use effect runs twice.

03:12:32
<transcript>: and i knew

03:12:35
aminunes: Im only use vs code cause i never took the time to learn neovim

03:12:35
<transcript>: And I knew that I don't like it. I knew it.

03:12:35
<transcript>: but i

03:12:37
<transcript>: But I don't like it.

03:12:40
theprimeagen: are you in debug?

03:12:42
<transcript>: New round. Okay, let's see. So that's where we set expired to false.

03:12:42
<transcript>: yeah

03:12:46
<transcript>: Yeah, this this all feels pretty bad. We got so many.

03:12:46
theprimeagen: i think in production it doesn't happen right?

03:12:48
wesleycoder: everybody has issues, my issue is I have lots of issues

03:12:49
<transcript>: Use States that we have to keep sync.

03:12:54
<transcript>: Handle expired.

03:12:56
<transcript>: As.

03:12:56
<transcript>: expired

03:12:59
<transcript>: Expired to true, but that gets called twice.

03:13:02
aminunes: but i have a alaias for neovim to just right vim

03:13:05
<transcript>: Which would be fine, I guess to set it to okay. So where else are we set? Expired.

03:13:11
misio_emisio: hello!

03:13:13
<transcript>: There's true here's. False. So when the timeout? Yeah, yeah. This is where we're trying to clear the timeout, right.

03:13:13
<transcript>: and it's not

03:13:14
<transcript>: And it's not.

03:13:17
<transcript>: It's still running twice.

03:13:23
<transcript>: Is there something that I can just.

03:13:23
<transcript>: infer

03:13:24
<transcript>: Infer.

03:13:33
<transcript>: This expire without actually having this explicit expired state.

03:13:33
<transcript>: like

03:13:35
<transcript>: Like that would be better. Maybe.

03:13:36
dyalicode: hello

03:13:41
<transcript>: Yeah, I am indebuge. That's right. That's a good call. So.

03:13:41
<transcript>: strict mode

03:13:44
<transcript>: Strict mode. It fires twice in Debug only.

03:13:44
<transcript>: but

03:13:48
<transcript>: But I'm in deep the whole time I'm building it.

03:13:48
<transcript>: so

03:13:49
dyalicode: !project

03:13:49
fossabot: Building awguess with the t3 stack (!awguess)

03:13:54
<transcript>: So do I just turn off strict mode? What do we think? Chat? Let's vote. Do I just turn off strict mode? Maybe I should.

03:13:54
<transcript>: maybe i'm not

03:13:57
<transcript>: Maybe I'm not good enough to react to use strict mode.

03:13:59
s1hofmann: Does expired have to be state, actually?

03:14:00
theprimeagen: use solid i think is the answer

03:14:11
<transcript>: Missios here. I can see how it's been a while. How are you? Not? Not like upset. You can take your time and join whenever you feel like it. But I feel like I haven't seen it. I miss you. How you doing.

03:14:11
<transcript>: y'all

03:14:18
s1hofmann: If you only want to keep track over rerenders, why not use a ref?

03:14:24
dyalicode: ;)

03:14:25
<transcript>: Y'all he's here. We're building a to be a guess. Eight of you guess the Ollie. I always want to say, AWS, guests use solid tea. That's what I think. Prime. And someone else said, just replace react with solid and your problems go away. I think the problem is the whole point of this project.

03:14:25
<transcript>: aside from

03:14:28
nexxeln: i just wish solid start releases and we make ct3a with solid start

03:14:30
misio_emisio: I'm good, thanks ^^ how about u? I've been quite busy recently

03:14:36
nexxeln: nextjs is the modern legacy framework LUL

03:14:36
theprimeagen: its really hard to use solid for a bit, its very different than react

03:14:38
<transcript>: Aside from it, sounds fun. And I want to play it the whole point list to learn the T three SEC. I just want to play with the T three stack. I don't think I can sub out. React for solid in the T three sack. Next, can I next. You're here.

03:14:40
<transcript>: Can I do that.

03:14:43
<transcript>: I just wish solid Start releases and we can make.

03:14:43
<transcript>: ct three

03:14:47
ajcwebdev: There's a really experimental svelte-t3-app

03:14:47
<transcript>: Ct Three A with solid Start, so create T Three with solid start.

03:14:50
ajcwebdev: No solid yet

03:14:57
wesleycoder: @nexxeln 🙏🏽

03:14:58
<transcript>: Hoffman says if you only want to keep track. Yeah. Okay, here we go. This is the line of thinking I was on Hoffman. Does expired have to be state? Actually, if you only want to keep track over rerenders, why not use a ref.

03:15:01
ajcwebdev: https://github.com/zach-hopkins/create-t3svelte-app

03:15:06
<transcript>: Because I always forget what userf does. That's why. But that's sounds smart if you only want to keep track.

03:15:06
<transcript>: over

03:15:08
<transcript>: Over rerenders. Why not use a ref.

03:15:08
<transcript>: i have to think

03:15:10
<transcript>: I have to think about that one. A little harder.

03:15:15
<transcript>: I've been good, I've been good, Missio.

03:15:15
<transcript>: quite

03:15:20
dyalicode: @nexxeln yeh i already talking with the creator solid-start hopfully fixed all issues and use release version :)

03:15:25
<transcript>: Quite busy. I get it. Mark. I think Mark will be back next week. Mark, I've missed dearly one of our moderators here. He's been very busy, but he'll be back next week. So Frag, you won't be.

03:15:28
<transcript>: We've been the only only.

03:15:28
<transcript>: mod for a bit

03:15:29
<transcript>: Mod for a bit.

03:15:29
<transcript>: well no rick

03:15:35
<transcript>: Well, no. Rick shows up sometimes, and I'm probably forgetting someone else. Jason J. Shows up sometimes.

03:15:35
<transcript>: next year

03:15:36
nexxeln: @dyalicode hell yeah

03:15:37
<transcript>: Next year is the Modern Legacy framework.

03:15:38
dyalicode: @ajcwebdev that s awesone  :)

03:15:43
nexxeln: solid start is really cool

03:15:48
<transcript>: Oh, is so prime. Solid. Was. I kind of thought prime. I thought solid would feel natural coming from react like the JSX thing. And there's still hooks in solid, I think.

03:15:48
<transcript>: thought that

03:15:55
theprimeagen: JSX is in common

03:15:57
<transcript>: Thought that'd be kind of an easy transition, but it sounds like maybe not. It's very different than react. But that's the point. I guess I want something very different from the egg. So that's good.

03:15:58
theprimeagen: correct

03:16:01
<transcript>: Really experimental T. Three app. No solid yet. Okay.

03:16:06
<transcript>: I don't think I want to try and learn cell right now. That sounds very, very different.

03:16:07
theprimeagen: but... you know, if statements are in common with c++, doesn't make it easy

03:16:09
piq9117: prime is the greatest react developer i know

03:16:12
<transcript>: Are you talking with the creator SolidStart. Hopefully fix all issues and use release version.

03:16:14
misio_emisio: what are you building btw?

03:16:16
<transcript>: Solid star is really cool.

03:16:20
<transcript>: You know if statements are in common of people.

03:16:22
<transcript>: It's funny.

03:16:27
<transcript>: Missio we are building AW guess.

03:16:27
<transcript>: aw

03:16:27
adamdotdev: !awguess

03:16:27
fossabot: awguess is a guessing game where you're given an AWS service icon and you have to choose the correct service! https://github.com/adamelmore/awguess

03:16:29
<transcript>: Aw guess.

03:16:29
<transcript>: like that

03:16:30
<transcript>: Like that.

03:16:30
<transcript>: okay

03:16:35
<transcript>: Okay so expired may not need to be state is what I'm hearing.

03:16:41
nexxeln: no the writing code part i the same. but changing how you think about the code is difficult

03:16:44
<transcript>: I don't like it being stated, so let's just play that out. Let's say it wasn't. Let's say it wasn't. State that we track.

03:16:49
<transcript>: How would that look? So here handle expired.

03:16:54
<transcript>: Why was I even setting it here? What was I doing with the expire.

03:17:02
<transcript>: That expired handle expired. Was I doing nothing with it? I think I was. And I deleted the code.

03:17:02
<transcript>: okay

03:17:05
<transcript>: Okay. Good. So we don't need it in the parent.

03:17:05
<transcript>: we might still

03:17:09
<transcript>: We might still need it in the child, but I think we can safely.

03:17:16
<transcript>: Oh, here it is. There it is. Okay. So we were disabling the buttons. We don't need to do that in the parent.

03:17:16
<transcript>: i don't

03:17:18
<transcript>: I don't think right.

03:17:18
<transcript>: i

03:17:21
<transcript>: I think we can safely.

03:17:26
<transcript>: Come on, think we can say just.

03:17:26
<transcript>: do that

03:17:28
<transcript>: Do that in the child.

03:17:28
<transcript>: so we don't need

03:17:30
<transcript>: So we don't need to bubble up.

03:17:30
<transcript>: all that stuff

03:17:32
<transcript>: All that stuff, right.

03:17:35
<transcript>: All this can go away.

03:17:41
<transcript>: Okay. And then here.

03:17:43
<transcript>: This goes away.

03:17:43
<transcript>: and then

03:17:46
<transcript>: And then this goes away.

03:17:54
<transcript>: And then this goes away. Okay. So on. Expired. What am I trying to accomplish here? I'm trying to say.

03:18:02
<transcript>: When the timer goes to 100 when we're 100% through the timer, we don't want you to be able to click on anything.

03:18:02
<transcript>: we want to

03:18:04
<transcript>: We want to show you the correct answer.

03:18:04
<transcript>: right

03:18:06
<transcript>: Right.

03:18:06
<transcript>: just so you

03:18:08
<transcript>: Just so you can learn.

03:18:08
<transcript>: and

03:18:12
<transcript>: And then we want to move to the next round after like a couple seconds, right.

03:18:12
<transcript>: that's

03:18:14
<transcript>: That's all I'm trying to do.

03:18:18
<transcript>: So how do I want to accomplish that.

03:18:23
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow. Thank you so much.

03:18:28
<transcript>: Don't need to catch up on chat. You guys are all just working away.

03:18:28
<transcript>: we're just coworking here

03:18:33
<transcript>: We're just coworking here. There's no chat, except next says no. The writing code part is the same.

03:18:33
<transcript>: changing

03:18:42
<transcript>: Changing how you think about the code is difficult. I think I just don't think about react the right way anyway, so I think anything that's different would probably be welcomed.

03:18:48
<transcript>: But I guess eight years.

03:18:53
<transcript>: Been doing the reacting for a while, so there's probably some stuff. Some stuff ingrained in there. Right.

03:18:57
<transcript>: Okay.

03:18:57
<transcript>: handle

03:19:01
<transcript>: Handle set interval, and then we clear the interval when the time goes off.

03:19:01
<transcript>: do

03:19:07
<transcript>: Do I have to have hang on? Do I have to have a use effect here.

03:19:15
<transcript>: Do I have to I guess how would I rerender? So when I do new game.

03:19:15
<transcript>: there is

03:19:25
<transcript>: There is an expires timestamp. It comes back from the server for this round and it's 10 seconds from now. But the client basically gets this time stamp and that's when it's going to expire.

03:19:25
<transcript>: is there

03:19:29
<transcript>: Is there a way for me to do this without this use effect in the first place.

03:19:29
<transcript>: because

03:19:39
<transcript>: Because generally, when I start having problems with these effect, I start thinking about, Do I need it and that's my approach right now. Do I need this use effect? Could I somehow.

03:19:39
<transcript>: render that

03:19:41
<transcript>: Render that Loading bar.

03:19:46
<transcript>: I could do an animation.

03:19:51
<transcript>: An animation that's timed to end at that.

03:19:56
<transcript>: Time. I have to stop it whenever the answer right.

03:19:58
wesleycoder: this is the problem that xstate would solve Sorry for bringing this back kekw

03:20:06
<transcript>: I still need to know? I still need to be tracking like win that time hits. We have some other state changes that need to happen, right.

03:20:06
<transcript>: this

03:20:23
<transcript>: This is the problem that X state would solve. Sorry for me. No, it's. It's exactly where my head was. Wesley, that's like, this is why I started thinking, I need to use xDate. It's like we hit these problems with expired and it just start feeling like it's a state machine. Like, this game is a state machine. That's what it should be.

03:20:27
<transcript>: I just don't know should I bring it back? Should we bring it back.

03:20:31
<transcript>: Is that just asking for more pain might be.

03:20:35
<transcript>: I do think like.

03:20:37
<transcript>: Having a.

03:20:37
<transcript>: timed

03:20:40
<transcript>: Timed like a delayed transition.

03:20:40
<transcript>: in a statement

03:20:41
<transcript>: In a statement.

03:20:41
<transcript>: makes

03:20:43
<transcript>: Makes sense here.

03:20:43
<transcript>: i don't

03:20:49
<transcript>: I don't like like having this interval, this 100 millisecond interval.

03:20:52
nexxeln: xstate too complex for me LUL

03:20:54
<transcript>: And like checking the time that just all feels bad in a use effect, no less.

03:21:02
<transcript>: X States. Too complex for Nexalm. Yeah. What would you do next? I'm curious. You're the author. You created T three.

03:21:04
<transcript>: Create T Three app.

03:21:04
<transcript>: this is

03:21:08
<transcript>: This is your baby, and we are in a.

03:21:08
<transcript>: t three app

03:21:09
<transcript>: T, Three app.

03:21:09
<transcript>: what would you do

03:21:10
<transcript>: What would you do.

03:21:10
<transcript>: i'm curious

03:21:12
<transcript>: I'm curious.

03:21:16
<transcript>: You clearly know some front end things to build this thing.

03:21:22
nexxeln: zustand

03:21:22
<transcript>: Because I do want to avoid just using X state.

03:21:22
<transcript>: generally

03:21:31
<transcript>: Generally if I can just, I don't know it. I have to learn it. And like, how does that stand? So that's another thing I don't know. And I have to learn.

03:21:41
<transcript>: Could you give me like a one liner? Next on like Why? Why would you use a stand or joke.

03:21:41
<transcript>: joe ty

03:21:43
<transcript>: Joe, Ty.

03:21:52
<transcript>: Like, what is the thing? That's too complex for me right now. I have a timer.

03:21:53
nexxeln: zustand is so simple

03:21:56
<transcript>: At the timer.

03:21:59
ajcwebdev: https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand#first-create-a-store

03:22:00
dnbull: zustand is easy to get going

03:22:01
<transcript>: And if they answer before the timer.

03:22:08
misio_emisio: zustand is awesome

03:22:08
<transcript>: Easy to get going. Is it also a state machine thing? Zestain is so simple.

03:22:09
aminunes: wait

03:22:11
<transcript>: Okay.

03:22:11
<transcript>: okay you guys

03:22:12
dnbull: not like other states where you have to spend hours

03:22:15
<transcript>: Okay, you guys are convincing me. Let me just look at it. Oh, Amy says, wait.

03:22:20
<transcript>: You were convincing me. And then Amy said, Wait. And I want to wait.

03:22:22
nexxeln: exactly

03:22:24
<transcript>: I like other States. We have to spend hours. Okay.

03:22:28
<transcript>: That sounds nice. First create a store.

03:22:30
aminunes: zustand is better

03:22:33
<transcript>: So it's like Redux light. Is that what you're telling me.

03:22:33
<transcript>: bind

03:22:38
<transcript>: Bind your components and that's it so bear counter. Use Bear, store.

03:22:38
<transcript>: state

03:22:40
<transcript>: State up errors.

03:22:42
<transcript>: And then controls.

03:22:46
<transcript>: Increased population.

03:22:48
misio_emisio: clearTimeout(AmuNunes)

03:22:50
misio_emisio: Keepo

03:22:51
<transcript>: Button increased population so you just have some some functions here.

03:22:53
<transcript>: And some States.

03:22:53
<transcript>: they're all kind of

03:22:56
<transcript>: They're all kind of in one big Blob, called a store.

03:23:00
<transcript>: I mean, it does look simple as far as these things go.

03:23:02
<transcript>: Clear. Time out.

03:23:03
aminunes: but do you really know why u are using useEffect

03:23:03
misio_emisio: ehh typo in such message FailFish

03:23:04
<transcript>: The stand is better.

03:23:04
<transcript>: so everyone

03:23:07
<transcript>: So everyone likes Zest Stand. Apparently.

03:23:12
<transcript>: Sometimes I just think I need to stop building front ends.

03:23:16
<transcript>: I just don't know if it might just be too much for me.

03:23:22
dnbull: easy peasy js is another easy one but zustand is better I think

03:23:28
<transcript>: Easy Pzjs is another easy one. Zestan is better.

03:23:29
aminunes: Like can you put your thought process ?

03:23:43
aminunes: @nexxeln you create t3 stack?

03:23:44
<transcript>: Let's talk about how before I like Pnpm add Zest and I start doing this like I did with X state. Let's talk about how we would do this with that stand. We would have a store that has instead of having all these independent use States, we would have.

03:23:44
<transcript>: one

03:23:51
<transcript>: One store that has all of our state on it. And we'd have some functions for like doing stuff to that state that all makes sense.

03:23:57
<transcript>: That feels good. It's a little reduxy, but with a much better.

03:23:57
<transcript>: ergonomics

03:23:58
<transcript>: Ergonomics.

03:23:58
<transcript>: i did not

03:23:59
nexxeln: i started ct3a, t3 stack was created by theo

03:24:06
<transcript>: I did not like working with Redux and having the actions all over the place and just it just felt like everything was all over the place.

03:24:11
<transcript>: So this does feel better. Think of the follow study time.

03:24:11
<transcript>: hey study time

03:24:12
aminunes: nice

03:24:13
<transcript>: Hey, study time. Thank you so much.

03:24:18
<transcript>: I love rating you study time. I love just watching you study.

03:24:18
<transcript>: you

03:24:21
<transcript>: You create T three SEC. Nexted. Yeah.

03:24:21
<transcript>: we'll teach you

03:24:28
<transcript>: We'll teach you, but yeah, yeah, Theo. But he started the Create T Three App CLI. Right.

03:24:36
<transcript>: So if we have it all in one place, will that help us? The timer. How will we do the timer.

03:24:36
<transcript>: so tell me this

03:24:39
<transcript>: So tell me this next.

03:24:39
<transcript>: also fl

03:24:43
<transcript>: Also Floyd Wall thinking for the Follow. How would we do our timer.

03:24:49
ajcwebdev: https://dev.to/ajcwebdev/a-first-look-at-create-t3-app-1i8f#history-of-the-t3-stack

03:24:51
<transcript>: Would this. Would we avoid our use effect in any way here? I don't think we would. I think we'd still have users act right.

03:24:58
ajcwebdev: Whole history right there

03:25:01
<transcript>: First look at Create T Three App History of the T Three sac.

03:25:03
<transcript>: Someone tell me.

03:25:06
<transcript>: Anthony. Or necks.

03:25:06
<transcript>: anybody

03:25:10
<transcript>: Anybody really let me tell me how would you do this.

03:25:10
<transcript>: how

03:25:11
<transcript>: How would you.

03:25:20
<transcript>: I would you simplify this use effect. It's the timer that I'm really upset with, right? I don't like don't like having this timer.

03:25:23
<transcript>: In this use effect. Is there a way around this.

03:25:23
<transcript>: because i

03:25:26
<transcript>: Because I do need to rerender.

03:25:26
<transcript>: i mean as long

03:25:26
ajcwebdev: I wouldn't use a useEffect in the first place

03:25:30
nexxeln: im not too familiar with the problem

03:25:34
<transcript>: I mean, as long as this thing's not just like a straight animation that we start, I need to render it. The progress changing, right.

03:25:40
<transcript>: Not too familiar with the problem. Yeah, I get it. You wouldn't use the US effect in the first place. Okay, so.

03:25:40
<transcript>: anthony

03:25:42
<transcript>: Anthony wouldn't use it.

03:25:42
<transcript>: let's

03:25:46
<transcript>: Let's do this if I want to comment this whole.

03:25:46
<transcript>: this whole

03:25:47
<transcript>: This whole paragraph.

03:25:53
<transcript>: How did I do that? I guess I would just select it all. So like VAP.

03:25:53
<transcript>: and get

03:25:55
<transcript>: And get the paragraphed.

03:26:02
<transcript>: No. What's it getting with paragraph? What about vast for function.

03:26:06
aminunes: @ajcwebdev Same

03:26:09
<transcript>: Well, I give up on that. We're just gonna do it the hard way.

03:26:09
<transcript>: seventeen

03:26:11
<transcript>: 17 J.

03:26:11
<transcript>: okay so we

03:26:15
<transcript>: Okay, so we got rid of the use effect. There is no use effect.

03:26:18
<transcript>: Well.

03:26:20
<transcript>: You start an animation.

03:26:23
<transcript>: Like, would you just.

03:26:23
<transcript>: win the

03:26:29
<transcript>: Win the round starts. We could fire off an animation that's timed to end on.

03:26:30
dnbull: I'm not smart enough to tell you what to do. I cringe when I use useEffect

03:26:34
<transcript>: The expires timestamp we could do that.

03:26:34
<transcript>: the inboil

03:26:39
<transcript>: The inboil not smartest. Tell me to do I cringe my UCFA I use it so much.

03:26:39
<transcript>: and every

03:26:43
<transcript>: And every time I use it, I feel like I'm doing something wrong.

03:26:53
<transcript>: But we do need to we need to animate this timer, or I guess we don't. I guess we don't. So I need to think about this again. We're making this whole thing out.

03:26:53
<transcript>: what are other ways

03:26:56
<transcript>: What are other ways we could express or visualize.

03:27:02
xheiksx: Would it help to think about it as statusbar, not progress bar?

03:27:02
ajcwebdev: Could animate it with css

03:27:11
<transcript>: A ticking timer. We could have numbers counting down. We'd have like a ten second in the corner. Like counting down from ten to zero. I guess that's still sort of the same problem, but with less Fidelity, like we don't have to render.

03:27:11
<transcript>: a load

03:27:13
aminunes: First option would be a animation, second could be numbers

03:27:15
<transcript>: A Loading bar. We could just render every second.

03:27:15
<transcript>: i still feel like there's

03:27:18
<transcript>: I still feel like there's use effect in there somewhere right.

03:27:24
aminunes: Third could be from sound

03:27:24
<transcript>: Would it help to think about it as status bar, not progress bar.

03:27:26
poggybitz: Are you using a window manager like yabai/amethyst?

03:27:27
<transcript>: Yeah. Welcome to Chat. First of all.

03:27:35
<transcript>: Not a progress bar. You're saying, like visually.

03:27:35
<transcript>: yeah

03:27:41
<transcript>: Yeah, we could, Anthony, we could animate it with CSS that's definitely bouncing around in my brain.

03:27:41
<transcript>: first

03:27:47
<transcript>: First option would be an animation. Second could be numbers. Third could be from sound.

03:27:54
nate_codes: GOOD MORNING ADAM HAPPY THURSDAY!

03:27:54
<transcript>: Yeah, Poggi. Welcome to Chat. I'm using you by because I saw Bash Money was using it and.

03:27:54
<transcript>: i mostly

03:27:58
<transcript>: I mostly like it. There are things I don't like, but I mostly like it.

03:28:06
<transcript>: If we were to animate it, then we just need to be able to stop the animation.

03:28:06
<transcript>: wherever

03:28:10
<transcript>: Wherever it's at whenever they answer.

03:28:10
<transcript>: seem doable

03:28:11
nexxeln: morning @nate_codes

03:28:15
<transcript>: Seem doable and then start the animation over whenever the new round starts.

03:28:15
<transcript>: that

03:28:19
<transcript>: That would avoid that would avoid a lot of.

03:28:19
<transcript>: a lot of this

03:28:22
<transcript>: A lot of this ugly use effect code, right.

03:28:22
<transcript>: nick

03:28:25
<transcript>: Nick Codes is here. Happy Thursday.

03:28:25
<transcript>: i love

03:28:26
dnbull: With my limited knowledge if youre doing some sort of countdown, I think useEffect is needed. But don't take my advice just thinking out loud

03:28:29
<transcript>: I love this streaming later thing and being able to have people like.

03:28:29
<transcript>: nate code

03:28:33
xheiksx: Seems like a CSS animation with iteration: 1 tbh

03:28:33
<transcript>: Nate Codes show up on the West Coast getting up early.

03:28:35
<transcript>: 720 on the West Coast.

03:28:35
<transcript>: look at you

03:28:36
<transcript>: Look at you.

03:28:37
nate_codes: @nexxeln GOOD MORNING NEXX! t3ggWave

03:28:47
<transcript>: My limited knowledge. If you're doing some sort of countdown, I think you affected, but don't take my advice just thinking out loud. No, that's definitely where my gut was. Dan Bowl.

03:28:49
aminunes: This time is perfect for me kekw

03:28:51
nate_codes: HeyGuys

03:28:54
<transcript>: Seems like a CSS animation with one iteration or with iteration one to be honest. Okay.

03:29:00
ajcwebdev: You can do an effect without useEffect is what I was getting at

03:29:02
nexxeln: yeah this time is perfect for me too

03:29:10
<transcript>: Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna stop staring at the code. We're gonna come over here for a second, and we're gonna when we go back to the code, we're gonna have an answer. We're gonna know exactly what we want to do.

03:29:14
<transcript>: We're just gonna talk through it.

03:29:20
<transcript>: So here's the thing about the animation. If I did it as an animation, if we just said.

03:29:20
<transcript>: when the

03:29:32
<transcript>: When the round starts, start an animation, it'll be like a ten second animation. But ultimately we're trying to have the animation end on the expires timestamp. If we did that, we still have to know.

03:29:35
<transcript>: When it expires.

03:29:35
<transcript>: so that

03:29:40
<transcript>: So that we can say you can't answer anymore we got to disable the buttons we got to start a new round.

03:29:40
<transcript>: so

03:29:41
nate_codes: Use ActionScript!

03:29:56
<transcript>: So there's still, like state changes happening at the end of that timer. Use action script. Nate, come on now. Action script. What is action script? Is that the thing that, like flash uses the door. Flash. That's action script, right? I've actually written some action script in my day. That's funny.

03:29:56
<transcript>: thank you for the follow

03:30:04
<transcript>: Thank you for the followup. Hoggy and Crazy Frog, Ferg. Crazy Frog, I think.

03:30:04
<transcript>: is that crazy

03:30:05
<transcript>: Is that Crazy frog.

03:30:08
<transcript>: What do you think, Nate.

03:30:10
xheiksx: timeout interval? to call something that stop from answering?

03:30:11
<transcript>: Does that stand xtate.

03:30:14
<transcript>: Just vanilla react, hooks.

03:30:14
<transcript>: time

03:30:17
<transcript>: Timeout interval to call something that stop from answering.

03:30:24
<transcript>: Yeah, that's. I mean, that's kind of what we are doing, but we were doing it.

03:30:26
nate_codes: Macromedia was ahead of their time!

03:30:31
<transcript>: So we were every 100 milliseconds. We were updating visually, the state of the thing.

03:30:31
<transcript>: and that

03:30:34
<transcript>: And that felt bad. I don't think that's the right way to do it.

03:30:34
<transcript>: so we could just

03:30:39
<transcript>: So we could just think of the animation as a separate thing we have to manage. We just have to figure that out.

03:30:39
<transcript>: but in terms

03:30:42
<transcript>: But in terms of like the actual game state.

03:30:42
<transcript>: we need to know

03:30:45
<transcript>: We need to know when the timer has expired.

03:30:45
<transcript>: this round

03:30:47
<transcript>: This round is over.

03:30:47
<transcript>: we're going to show you

03:31:05
<transcript>: We're going to show you the right answer because you didn't get it in time. We're not gonna let you click on anything, and then we're gonna transition into the new one. I really think this is a state machine. Honestly, the more I talk through it, I think of like that's a distinct state that the game enters into it. Does it when you click an answer to it's, just when you click and answer that happens to have.

03:31:05
<transcript>: a choice

03:31:11
<transcript>: A choice like you made a choice when it expires, it's the same state, just there's no choice.

03:31:14
nexxeln: zustand is a state machine

03:31:15
ajcwebdev: aws step functions

03:31:15
<transcript>: If I were like an X state person.

03:31:18
nate_codes: I’ve been learning motion.dev, gives you some nice callbacks and animation control APIs

03:31:26
<transcript>: I would definitely use xDate. Oh, Zustin is a state machine. Okay, well, next, there you go. Let's just use lesson. Is that the current AWS step function. Stop at Anthony, stop it.

03:31:26
<transcript>: we're not gonna use

03:31:27
dnbull: I found an article kind of explaining what you want with useEffect (didnt read it just skimmed through it)

03:31:41
<transcript>: We're not gonna use step functions. Although this is an AWS game, I should probably not be so dismissive of AWS options, but I think not a server side thing. We've got serverside sorted out, like on the server. If you answer after expirations, if the client allows you to push it, we're still not going to let you be correct.

03:31:41
<transcript>: your score is not going to

03:31:49
<transcript>: Your score is not going to go up if it was Atrix expiration. So we're handled on the server from that sense we're validating, but.

03:31:49
<transcript>: on the front

03:31:51
<transcript>: On the front end. We still have to lay.

03:31:51
<transcript>: the

03:31:53
<transcript>: The state in the browser.

03:31:53
<transcript>: learning

03:32:03
<transcript>: Learning Motion Dev gives you some nice callbacks and Animation Control APIs. Okay. So maybe that's maybe it is it's dust end and then some animations for the bar finish.

03:32:03
<transcript>: finishing

03:32:09
<transcript>: Finishing what you want with use back. Didn't read it. Just enter it. Yeah, shoot. It my way to Embolt. I do have to pee again.

03:32:17
<transcript>: That's the problem with streaming is I drink a lot of water and that means you guys have to stare at my keyboard a lot. I'm sorry. Be right back.

03:32:52
aminunes: I want to start my own portefolio any ui/ux help?

03:33:02
nate_codes: HOW DARE YOU PEE WHILE WEARING A VIRTUAL COWBOY HAT AND MUSTACHE! WE WERE SAVING THOSE FOR STREAM!

03:35:54
<transcript>: I see at certain eight. It's very upset that I had to go pee.

03:35:58
<transcript>: Okay. I'm feeling pretty good about Zest end. The more I think about it.

03:35:58
<transcript>: a light

03:36:00
<transcript>: A light state machine.

03:36:00
<transcript>: sounds

03:36:11
<transcript>: Sounds kind of nice. Like I think I'm just getting a little lost in X state and like creating the machine and then use a machine and then all that stuff. Does that stand feels a little more native and react.

03:36:11
<transcript>: is that an

03:36:20
<transcript>: Is that an accurate assessment? Next, if you're still here, we're gonna try it, I think. And maybe we'll just use some kind of animation library, motion Dev or something.

03:36:20
<transcript>: to make the

03:36:27
<transcript>: To make the bar and move across the screen. But we'll treat that as like a secondary thing we're not too worried about because there's a lot of ways we could visualize that, right.

03:36:30
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:36:30
<transcript>: i think so

03:36:33
<transcript>: I think so. First a fall. How's there been doing.

03:36:35
nexxeln: you can literally create your own zustand in one file

03:36:37
<transcript>: It's cooled off here where I live.

03:36:37
<transcript>: we're

03:36:41
<transcript>: We're gonna have a little Fall Family Fest thing today.

03:36:41
<transcript>: literally create

03:36:44
nexxeln: but it won't be as good as zustand

03:36:45
<transcript>: Literally create your own Zestan in one file. I love it.

03:36:45
<transcript>: thank you for the

03:36:49
<transcript>: Thank you for the Follow OS carmilage. I appreciate that. Follow.

03:36:49
<transcript>: it won't

03:36:54
nexxeln: if you look at the source its really simple

03:36:55
<transcript>: It won't be as good as Austin. Oh, you create your own zest? I see your Sands? I gotcha.

03:36:55
<transcript>: it's

03:36:57
<transcript>: It's so minimal, that.

03:36:57
<transcript>: yeah

03:37:03
<transcript>: Yeah, I gotcha really some I love it. Okay. We're doing it. Zustend it is.

03:37:07
<transcript>: Let's Pmpnp is it removed.

03:37:07
<transcript>: rem

03:37:10
<transcript>: Remove X state.

03:37:13
<transcript>: And Xate react.

03:37:13
aminunes: btw

03:37:17
<transcript>: Okay.

03:37:17
<transcript>: pmp

03:37:19
<transcript>: Pmpm, ad.

03:37:21
<transcript>: Zust.

03:37:23
aminunes: is pnpn better then npx

03:37:26
<transcript>: All right.

03:37:28
<transcript>: Yeah. The stand. Okay.

03:37:31
<transcript>: Create a store.

03:37:33
nexxeln: pnpm is the best

03:37:33
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:37:40
<transcript>: So let's just make our store, like, up here. So.

03:37:40
<transcript>: will it

03:37:45
<transcript>: Will it be in the round or will it be in the parent.

03:37:47
aminunes: And is that zsh?

03:37:48
<transcript>: So I want it to be in the round or the parent.

03:37:48
<transcript>: we're gonna do

03:37:50
<transcript>: We're gonna do it in the round for now.

03:37:53
<transcript>: I think.

03:37:56
<transcript>: So let's say.

03:37:58
<transcript>: Cast.

03:38:00
<transcript>: Round store.

03:38:11
<transcript>: Let's go ahead and import that from the stand. There it is.

03:38:14
<transcript>: Let's end react. I'll just do.

03:38:14
<transcript>: okay

03:38:16
<transcript>: Okay create.

03:38:16
<transcript>: set

03:38:17
<transcript>: Set.

03:38:18
aminunes: @nexxeln Soo should i just stop using npx

03:38:23
<transcript>: And then we do our just all of our state lives in here. Right? So.

03:38:23
<transcript>: ram

03:38:25
<transcript>: Ram store is going to have.

03:38:33
<transcript>: What does around have it just has the current round. I guess this might be the game store. I don't know.

03:38:35
schrew: Good (late) morning adam!

03:38:38
<transcript>: Round which is around, but I guess it's optional.

03:38:38
<transcript>: here

03:38:41
<transcript>: Here the follow fields. Bra.

03:38:44
<transcript>: Good morning? True good late morning.

03:38:44
<transcript>: that's still morning

03:38:46
<transcript>: That's still morning for me.

03:38:48
<transcript>: And.

03:38:49
nexxeln: npx is a different thing i assume you mean npm

03:38:52
<transcript>: Is PMP embedded MPX.

03:38:58
aminunes: npm yes

03:38:58
<transcript>: Pmpm I use PMPM when I can I can't use it in.

03:38:58
<transcript>: yeah i think

03:39:00
<transcript>: Yeah, I think you mean MPM. Yeah.

03:39:00
<transcript>: i

03:39:04
nexxeln: yeah try it out

03:39:14
<transcript>: I use it for projects that aren't CDK projects where I'm compiled TypeScript functions. If I'm compiling TypeScript Lambda functions with the nodes construct in CDK, I can't use BNPM every other time I use it. It's awesome.

03:39:14
<transcript>: i mean

03:39:23
<transcript>: I mean like faster, way less disk space, way more sane the way it handles node modules, especially Mona repos. I love it.

03:39:23
<transcript>: seems like just better

03:39:30
<transcript>: Seems like just better all around than yarn or NPM for me at least I don't know. Maybe not for your use case.

03:39:34
<transcript>: But I'd say, Give it a shot. It's fast.

03:39:39
<transcript>: Okay. So expression expected. What is that mean.

03:39:41
<transcript>: Round.

03:39:53
<transcript>: I'd say like round or undefined.

03:40:00
<transcript>: So there is something wrong here is my syntax just way off.

03:40:00
<transcript>: those and

03:40:02
<transcript>: Those and then that and then that.

03:40:04
<transcript>: Looks normal.

03:40:10
<transcript>: Get there.

03:40:10
<transcript>: oh round

03:40:13
<transcript>: Oh round has to be just.

03:40:13
<transcript>: something like this

03:40:17
<transcript>: Something like this, right. Oh, that has to be a value, not a type.

03:40:17
<transcript>: oh okay

03:40:20
<transcript>: Oh. Okay. So that's the initial value.

03:40:22
<transcript>: Okay.

03:40:22
<transcript>: well

03:40:23
<transcript>: Well.

03:40:27
<transcript>: The initial value of this is going to be nothing.

03:40:36
<transcript>: Okay, so let's just maybe we should start with functions. What are the functions here? Answer is a function.

03:40:40
<transcript>: And it's gonna be set.

03:40:42
<transcript>: Eight.

03:40:46
<transcript>: To do that for now.

03:40:49
<transcript>: I renamed.

03:40:55
nexxeln: you cann pass a generic to create for it to be typed

03:40:55
<transcript>: So let's answer. I'm just trying to set this up. Answer. And then we have.

03:41:00
<transcript>: You can pass a generic to create a.

03:41:00
<transcript>: great

03:41:04
<transcript>: Great for it to be Typed. Okay. Cool. So up here when I do create.

03:41:04
<transcript>: i can

03:41:07
<transcript>: I can say like.

03:41:10
<transcript>: Around or something. I don't know.

03:41:15
<transcript>: Then the state has to match that shape. Okay. So let's do.

03:41:17
<transcript>: Type.

03:41:19
<transcript>: Round.

03:41:19
<transcript>: state

03:41:21
<transcript>: State.

03:41:22
<transcript>: Say.

03:41:22
<transcript>: now

03:41:24
<transcript>: Now.

03:41:26
<transcript>: Like this.

03:41:29
<transcript>: I have a round.

03:41:29
<transcript>: sur

03:41:31
<transcript>: Surround.

03:41:35
<transcript>: And this is gonna be Round state.

03:41:39
<transcript>: So then.

03:41:39
<transcript>: the

03:41:43
<transcript>: The answer is a function. I guess I need to define.

03:41:43
<transcript>: that

03:41:45
<transcript>: That here.

03:41:48
<transcript>: Like that.

03:41:50
<transcript>: Answer has that choice.

03:42:04
<transcript>: What am I doing wrong here.

03:42:09
<transcript>: Say that.

03:42:21
<transcript>: When am I doing wrong? There's so many.

03:42:24
<transcript>: So many things broken.

03:42:26
<transcript>: Round store.

03:42:28
<transcript>: Is assigned.

03:42:33
nexxeln: https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand#typescript-usage

03:42:40
<transcript>: Voided last Apple typestate void is on time I'm gonna type round state oh answer has to return yeah yeah round state okay.

03:42:40
<transcript>: sure

03:42:41
<transcript>: Sure.

03:42:43
<transcript>: What's wrong now.

03:42:54
<transcript>: Round source sign. Okay. Here Argon type set.

03:42:54
<transcript>: that

03:43:02
<transcript>: That is not assignable to parameter of type state creator round. Okay, so they're saying this isn't good enough.

03:43:10
<transcript>: Because I didn't return the whole state. Yeah. Yeah. So here I would have to be like, say.

03:43:12
<transcript>: It's getting closer. Maybe.

03:43:15
<transcript>: A primer choice and plus it has any type.

03:43:21
<transcript>: We get in there.

03:43:23
<transcript>: Voided to us.

03:43:23
<transcript>: set

03:43:25
<transcript>: Set? What do I do.

03:43:25
<transcript>: set

03:43:27
<transcript>: Set.

03:43:33
<transcript>: So choice set and then bears equals so I don't need to spread it.

03:43:39
<transcript>: But I do need to what I do need to say like round.

03:43:43
<transcript>: They say round.

03:43:45
<transcript>: Five or something.

03:43:45
<transcript>: just trying to

03:43:49
<transcript>: Just trying to get to build here.

03:43:51
<transcript>: Zestanti Script usage.

03:43:53
<transcript>: Oh, maybe that's my problem.

03:43:58
<transcript>: Is that my problem? We got to get on track here. We got to ship this thing.

03:44:00
<transcript>: Next I.

03:44:05
<transcript>: 'm shipping it so you guys can play with it. We're trying to get the timer right.

03:44:13
<transcript>: Basic type scripture usage doesn't require anything special except for writing. Create state instead of that. Okay.

03:44:13
<transcript>: but

03:44:18
<transcript>: But then what's going on here? So Bear State Bears an increase.

03:44:18
<transcript>: use

03:44:20
<transcript>: Use bear store create bear state.

03:44:20
<transcript>: dev tool

03:44:22
<transcript>: Dev tools? What.

03:44:27
<transcript>: Persists. Oh, that's optional. I guess persists.

03:44:36
<transcript>: What are those Dev tools and persists. I guess those are optional. Could just have it like this set.

03:44:36
<transcript>: and then there's

03:44:39
<transcript>: And then there's my Bears in my inner crease.

03:44:41
<transcript>: And then.

03:44:43
<transcript>: Okay.

03:44:43
<transcript>: so

03:44:44
nexxeln: you can ignore that

03:44:49
<transcript>: So persist just lets you have the state stored in local storage or something.

03:44:51
<transcript>: You can ignore that. Okay.

03:44:56
<transcript>: So increase by set state.

03:44:56
<transcript>: and

03:44:58
<transcript>: And it just returns.

03:44:58
<transcript>: state

03:45:00
<transcript>: State.

03:45:04
<transcript>: So we're turns everything that's not a function like you have to return.

03:45:04
<transcript>: or just

03:45:07
<transcript>: Or just changes, I guess. Just things that change.

03:45:07
<transcript>: okay

03:45:11
<transcript>: Okay. So what's what's going on here.

03:45:15
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow and I.

03:45:25
<transcript>: Set partial is not a followable parameter type stack or state creator.

03:45:30
nexxeln: yeah, persist can save to localstorage

03:45:33
fredkisss: answer should return void

03:45:33
<transcript>: Type void is not assignable to type round state so this one.

03:45:37
<transcript>: Is void. A Deset return.

03:45:37
<transcript>: void

03:45:38
<transcript>: Void.

03:45:43
fredkisss: in the type

03:45:44
<transcript>: Because all they're doing is returning.

03:45:47
<transcript>: Set right.

03:45:53
<transcript>: Is my type. There's. Oh, this shouldn't be here. You don't define those. I bet.

03:45:56
<transcript>: Always.

03:46:15
<transcript>: Should return void and the type. So I do need to have the yeah, because they have it up here. Okay. Okay.

03:46:17
<transcript>: So just read the docs.

03:46:20
<transcript>: Boys, now we're gonna.

03:46:29
<transcript>: Answer choice. Void.

03:46:41
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow. Nixon and Greg Galactic. I appreciate all your follows. I really do. It's nice to have new friends on Twitch. Please come back.

03:46:48
<transcript>: Also be bet just started a follow train.

03:46:50
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:46:50
<transcript>: still

03:46:52
dnbull: i think you have syntax error? don't you need parens before bracket after arrow?

03:46:55
<transcript>: Still same voice is not assignable to type round state.

03:46:55
<transcript>: where

03:46:58
<transcript>: Where do you see? Void? Here.

03:46:59
<transcript>: Answer.

03:47:02
dnbull: => ({...})

03:47:02
<transcript>: So round store.

03:47:08
<transcript>: Create round state.

03:47:09
im_noxz: its create()

03:47:10
<transcript>: Set.

03:47:17
<transcript>: And then they have bears equals zero. I guess I need to initialize round undefined.

03:47:20
<transcript>: Like I wouldn't right.

03:47:26
ssspenna: are you building some kind of aws trivia app?

03:47:34
<transcript>: Is the problem here.

03:47:35
nexxeln: !awguess

03:47:35
fossabot: awguess is a guessing game where you're given an AWS service icon and you have to choose the correct service! https://github.com/adamelmore/awguess

03:47:39
im_noxz: set is to early

03:47:40
<transcript>: Are you building some kind of a trivia? I am spinning. Welcome to chat.

03:47:41
fredkisss: a syntax error

03:47:47
<transcript>: It's create. Oh, did I do something wrong? I think you have syntax error. Don't you need purens before brackets, after arrow.

03:47:53
<transcript>: So parrins.

03:47:55
<transcript>: Parrita.

03:47:55
<transcript>: after

03:48:02
<transcript>: After Arrow. Yeah, I've got the Prince. Are you saying I don't need them? But I'm returning that, aren't I just like they did here.

03:48:10
<transcript>: Ask mutual. Mutual. What the syntax? This is called this operator.

03:48:10
<transcript>: state

03:48:15
dnbull: not that line

03:48:15
ssspenna: nice, happy coding! :)

03:48:18
nexxeln: create(){(set) => }

03:48:18
<transcript>: State bears, state bears. Plus by like that's what I'm doing. But I'm just saying it's undefined because I don't really have a round.

03:48:22
dnbull: the line above

03:48:28
<transcript>: And I guess like here I would have so answer. Let's get a little more realistic here. There's a round. There's also a choice.

03:48:28
<transcript>: which is a

03:48:31
<transcript>: Which is a string that's also optional.

03:48:35
<transcript>: So what this would do is in reality.

03:48:35
<transcript>: we would just

03:48:40
<transcript>: We would just change out. This would be choice.

03:48:40
<transcript>: delete

03:48:43
nexxeln: oh wait im wrong

03:48:47
<transcript>: Delete to bracket like that. That's what I was actually do. We'd set the choice when you answer, we set choice.

03:48:49
<transcript>: Okay.

03:48:53
<transcript>: Still doesn't like it though.

03:48:57
<transcript>: Set.

03:48:57
<transcript>: oh

03:49:01
nexxeln: create()((set) => ...)

03:49:04
<transcript>: Oh, I need these. Oh, I see what you're saying. You said this, and I just ignored you. Or I just thought your time on someone else.

03:49:11
<transcript>: To build.

03:49:12
dnbull: yes there we go

03:49:15
<transcript>: Okay. Thank you. Dan. Bull.

03:49:16
aminunes: quick question

03:49:17
<transcript>: You're on to it.

03:49:17
<transcript>: i just didn't see it

03:49:18
<transcript>: I just didn't see it.

03:49:19
dnbull: that just took 10 mins Kappa

03:49:24
<transcript>: Set this too early. Syntax error. Not that line. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

03:49:24
<transcript>: yeah

03:49:26
<transcript>: Yeah, Yeah.

03:49:27
<transcript>: We got it.

03:49:29
<transcript>: That just took ten minutes.

03:49:34
aminunes: what terminal u use and font, and terminal setup?

03:49:36
<transcript>: Yeah, it's amazing how long stuff takes when I'm streaming. I feel like I don't know if I'm faster, I feel like if I were this slow.

03:49:36
<transcript>: with

03:49:41
<transcript>: With everything I built, I wouldn't have built anything in my life. Because.

03:49:45
<transcript>: It takes me a long time. I think it's Twitch. I think it's something about.

03:49:53
<transcript>: I could stop. I interact. I get back to it. Not in a hurry.

03:49:53
<transcript>: something

03:49:54
<transcript>: Something about that.

03:50:01
<transcript>: But I don't mind it. I prefer it. I'd rather hang out with you all it's more fun makes it way more fun.

03:50:01
<transcript>: what

03:50:04
<transcript>: What part will you use in Font terminal setup? It's all.

03:50:04
<transcript>: in

03:50:06
adamdotdev: !dotfiles

03:50:06
fossabot: Adam's dotfiles live here: https://github.com/adamelmore/dotfiles

03:50:07
<transcript>: In my.

03:50:07
<transcript>: files

03:50:08
<transcript>: Files. There you go.

03:50:12
<transcript>: Okay round store.

03:50:18
<transcript>: Answer. And that means you get a choice. So is there like are there like events.

03:50:22
fredkisss: it's not about you, when i stream i lose half of my braincells so it is the same for everyone i think

03:50:28
<transcript>: So if I make this whole state thing and I replace a bunch of or I make this store and I replace all this local state.

03:50:30
dnbull: I agree ^

03:50:33
<transcript>: And unanswered choice result.

03:50:39
dnbull: I instantly become 80% dumb

03:50:41
<transcript>: Like when we answer, we pass a choice. We got a bunch of.

03:50:41
<transcript>: things

03:50:44
<transcript>: Things we got to do at that point, right.

03:50:44
<transcript>: like

03:50:46
aminunes: Rip me having windows

03:50:47
<transcript>: Like after we answer, we need to.

03:50:47
<transcript>: call

03:50:49
<transcript>: Call a mutation.

03:50:53
<transcript>: How am I going to be doing this in React. Am I gonna be watching.

03:50:58
<transcript>: Am I gonna be use affecting and watching this.

03:50:58
<transcript>: state change

03:51:03
<transcript>: State change, and then responding to it. Or is there something more elegant than that.

03:51:08
<transcript>: About you when I stream I lose half of my brain cells.

03:51:08
<transcript>: so it's to say

03:51:10
<transcript>: So it's to say for everyone, okay, good to know.

03:51:12
<transcript>: Good to know.

03:51:23
fredkisss: No useEffect, you select the state you want to use

03:51:25
<transcript>: I'm trying to sort out how Zest stand.

03:51:25
<transcript>: let's just look a little bit

03:51:27
<transcript>: Let's just look a little bit more.

03:51:31
<transcript>: Calling actions outside of rubbish.

03:51:37
<transcript>: Select the beginning. So once you have the bind components, so.

03:51:37
<transcript>: state

03:51:43
<transcript>: State use bear store. I'm returning state increased population so that's now my function.

03:51:43
<transcript>: that increases

03:51:46
<transcript>: That increases population.

03:51:46
<transcript>: that makes sense

03:51:47
<transcript>: That makes sense.

03:51:47
<transcript>: how do you pass

03:51:50
<transcript>: How do you pass? Args? I guess. One question.

03:51:56
<transcript>: Use bears bear store nuts honey.

03:51:58
<transcript>: State.

03:51:59
fredkisss: see on the demo :  https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/

03:52:02
<transcript>: Shallow.

03:52:10
<transcript>: Array pick rerenders the component in either States or honey change.

03:52:14
<transcript>: I.

03:52:20
<transcript>: Mapped picks.

03:52:24
fredkisss: you should rename the var roundStore to useRoundStore

03:52:25
<transcript>: From working.

03:52:29
<transcript>: They provide any custom quality function.

03:52:31
<transcript>: Okay.

03:52:34
<transcript>: See the demo.

03:52:34
<transcript>: you select

03:52:37
<transcript>: You select the state you want to use, okay.

03:52:42
<transcript>: Should rename the VAR round store to use round store.

03:52:45
<transcript>: Okay. I can do that.

03:52:51
<transcript>: That's a crazy, cool site. Wow.

03:52:54
<transcript>: This is maybe the coolest thing I've ever seen.

03:52:59
<transcript>: That bear going in and out of focus. That does it for me. Wow.

03:52:59
<transcript>: i

03:53:01
<transcript>: I love this thing.

03:53:01
<transcript>: okay

03:53:05
<transcript>: Okay, create a used store count.

03:53:05
<transcript>: and then

03:53:09
aminunes: How do you create that effect in html css

03:53:13
nexxeln: its made with react-three-fiber

03:53:17
<transcript>: And then have an increment function which does count state, count plus one. And then we have controls. Use store state Inc. The button just does ink.

03:53:17
<transcript>: counter

03:53:20
<transcript>: Counter use store state count. Okay, that'll make sense.

03:53:23
<transcript>: That all makes sense.

03:53:27
<transcript>: Reactory fiber. That is.

03:53:27
<transcript>: too cool

03:53:29
<transcript>: Too cool. I will.

03:53:35
<transcript>: So this should be instead of round source can be used round store.

03:53:38
<transcript>: Use Round store.

03:53:44
nexxeln: poimandres made it, they're creators of zustand, react-three-fiber, pretty much all cool react libraries

03:53:45
<transcript>: And this is just where we're encapsulating all of these state changes.

03:53:52
<transcript>: And the shape of the state like this is how we're going to store it. All right. So.

03:54:03
<transcript>: Take the problem is I have this state, I have this component busted out.

03:54:03
<transcript>: i have this

03:54:07
<transcript>: I have this round component. Let's just put it on one component. Maybe that's my problem.

03:54:12
<transcript>: Think my problem is I'm doing all this into components.

03:54:20
<transcript>: And if I had it all in one be easier to reason about unless weird passing step around. Let's do that.

03:54:20
<transcript>: let's

03:54:21
<transcript>: Let's.

03:54:31
<transcript>: Stage it off.

03:54:31
<transcript>: come back to

03:54:33
<transcript>: Come back to this many two.

03:54:34
<transcript>: We're gonna delete.

03:54:34
<transcript>: all

03:54:36
<transcript>: All this.

03:54:40
<transcript>: No.

03:54:46
<transcript>: Okay. We're going to consolidate. We're gonna put all this.

03:54:46
<transcript>: here

03:54:47
<transcript>: Here.

03:54:51
<transcript>: I can do this. I could yank.

03:54:51
<transcript>: inside

03:54:52
<transcript>: Inside.

03:54:54
<transcript>: Forens.

03:54:54
<transcript>: and

03:54:58
<transcript>: And go up here and we're gonna paste it instead of round we're gonna have.

03:55:01
<transcript>: All that stuff.

03:55:03
<transcript>: Gonna hate me for a bit.

03:55:05
<transcript>: So angry.

03:55:10
<transcript>: Current round. So we're gonna comment all this out.

03:55:13
<transcript>: Got a little too much.

03:55:19
<transcript>: Okay. So now we've just brought all that component stuff up here.

03:55:23
<transcript>: Round can change to.

03:55:26
<transcript>: Current round.

03:55:35
<transcript>: Lapse. We'll come back to.

03:55:39
<transcript>: That's current round.

03:55:42
<transcript>: Disabled. We'll come back to.

03:55:42
<transcript>: unans

03:55:44
<transcript>: Unanswered.

03:55:47
<transcript>: Answer is going to be handling Sir, I think.

03:55:57
<transcript>: Handle answer disabled. We'll come back to okay, so we're just trying to move all this component.

03:55:57
<transcript>: trying to get

03:56:00
<transcript>: Trying to get all this stuff out of here.

03:56:00
<transcript>: we're gonna have

03:56:06
<transcript>: We're gonna have one component right now. I think having multiple components. It's hurting. It's hurting me. Not helping me.

03:56:13
<transcript>: Delete all that. And then there's no other state, right.

03:56:17
<transcript>: Flap. So we have some buttons. Okay.

03:56:19
<transcript>: Okay.

03:56:19
<transcript>: so

03:56:23
<transcript>: So now we can take our round state.

03:56:26
<transcript>: And let's put all this.

03:56:29
<transcript>: Up here.

03:56:33
<transcript>: Like right here.

03:56:33
<transcript>: okay

03:56:38
<transcript>: Okay. I'm feeling good about this. I'm all in on the Zest and train.

03:56:43
<transcript>: At roundstate we've got choice, answer.

03:56:43
<transcript>: elapsed

03:56:45
<transcript>: Elapsed, I guess.

03:56:50
<transcript>: We want to store a lap. Probably not. We don't want to store elapsed.

03:56:53
<transcript>: We want to have a result.

03:56:56
<transcript>: Like that.

03:56:58
<transcript>: Choice.

03:56:58
<transcript>: answer

03:57:00
<transcript>: Answer is a function.

03:57:04
<transcript>: Come down here and start pieces all together.

03:57:10
<transcript>: So we have that disabled was actually if we.

03:57:14
<transcript>: Undefined we're just gonna have, like, a state of the game.

03:57:14
<transcript>: we

03:57:17
<transcript>: We're gonna we're gonna do like the thing.

03:57:21
<transcript>: Like as if it were a state machine. Right.

03:57:21
<transcript>: we're gonna

03:57:25
<transcript>: We're gonna, like, Have a string, just a discriminated Union.

03:57:27
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:57:39
<transcript>: Their creators a Zest and Reactory Fiber pretty much all cool. React Bible Libraries. Okay. So the same person that made Reactory Fiber also made.

03:57:39
<transcript>: zest stand

03:57:41
<transcript>: Zest stand.

03:57:41
<transcript>: that's

03:57:42
<transcript>: That's cool.

03:57:49
<transcript>: I could play with this background for the rest of the stream. You guys would all get pretty bored, so I'm not gonna do it, but I could.

03:57:49
<transcript>: okay

03:57:56
<transcript>: Okay, we have the image current round. So here we're gonna just comment these out for a second.

03:57:58
trash_dev: herro

03:58:00
<transcript>: And this out for a SEC. Okay.

03:58:05
<transcript>: Sabled we're gonna comment out for a SEC.

03:58:07
<transcript>: So we should have.

03:58:07
<transcript>: a thing that

03:58:09
<transcript>: A thing that renders now.

03:58:11
nexxeln: trash_dev PogChamp

03:58:13
<transcript>: Oh use effect is not used.

03:58:15
<transcript>: That's a good sign.

03:58:16
trash_dev: o/

03:58:22
<transcript>: It's a great sign. Feeling good about it so used Round Store. We need to have some other things we're gonna have like a.

03:58:22
<transcript>: state

03:58:24
<transcript>: State.

03:58:29
<transcript>: Which is gonna be a string, it's gonna be discriminated Union. It could be idle.

03:58:34
<transcript>: It could be this is gonna be game state, not round state, by the way.

03:58:34
<transcript>: it could be id

03:58:36
<transcript>: It could be idle, it could be.

03:58:36
<transcript>: active

03:58:38
<transcript>: Active.

03:58:41
<transcript>: It could be correct.

03:58:43
<transcript>: Or incorrect.

03:58:46
<transcript>: Or expired. Right.

03:58:51
<transcript>: This is going to be.

03:58:54
<transcript>: Game state.

03:58:57
<transcript>: Oh.

03:59:02
<transcript>: Bad games state enter.

03:59:06
<transcript>: And then this is going to be used game store.

03:59:08
<transcript>: Hey.

03:59:08
<transcript>: what's from

03:59:10
<transcript>: What's from here? You.

03:59:10
<transcript>: 're

03:59:13
<transcript>: 're State is required.

03:59:20
<transcript>: State starts at Idle. Oh, I'm feeling it now it's coming together. We're doing it people.

03:59:23
<transcript>: Precious here hey trash.

03:59:28
<transcript>: Trash. I hate the front end. That's what we decided.

03:59:31
<transcript>: Frontend is bad.

03:59:31
<transcript>: do you do frontend

03:59:36
<transcript>: Do you do frontend development trash? I've only ever seen you like I'm new to Twitch, I've only ever seen you do like TypeScript, challenges.

03:59:36
<transcript>: are you

03:59:40
<transcript>: Are you a frontend person? You back in person. You full stack.

03:59:42
<transcript>: Are you.

03:59:42
<transcript>: what are you

03:59:42
trash_dev: both

03:59:43
<transcript>: What are you.

03:59:43
<transcript>: man

03:59:46
<transcript>: Manuel, thank you for the follow.

03:59:46
<transcript>: both okay

03:59:48
<transcript>: Both. Okay. Me too.

03:59:52
trash_dev: suck at devops

03:59:57
<transcript>: Do you prefer one of the other? You like reluctantly, a full frontend developer, mostly like backend or vice versa.

03:59:57
<transcript>: second dev

03:59:58
<transcript>: Second DevOps. Okay.

04:00:02
oskrm: whats bad with front end?

04:00:09
<transcript>: So would you call yourself like, if somebody made you, they were like trash. No, you can only work on one front in or backend, which 122.

04:00:13
dnbull: that its the front and not the back Kappa

04:00:14
<transcript>: Nothing bad with front end Oscar.

04:00:14
<transcript>: i'm just

04:00:15
aminunes: backend

04:00:15
trash_dev: prefer frontend. started as backend engineer and switched

04:00:18
oskrm: its really intuitive n't LUL

04:00:21
<transcript>: I'm just bad at it. I'm bad at frontend. There's nothing bad about front end. But I am bad at frontend.

04:00:26
cowfacedude99: `says the guy who spent a month on the overlays` LUL

04:00:34
<transcript>: Prefer frontend started. Back in engineering. Switched. Okay. So I started as a backend engineer. I work alone, so I have to build it all. And I generally haven't enjoyed frontend development. I'm just I don't I guess I don't think.

04:00:34
<transcript>: frontend

04:00:37
<transcript>: Frontendy or something. I don't know.

04:00:38
trash_dev: 🤣

04:00:40
<transcript>: It's really intuitive.

04:00:48
aminunes: Cause i now more languages of backend, and im trying to learn front end by myself

04:00:49
<transcript>: Says the guy who spent a month on the Overlays. Yeah, exactly. I spent all my time doing frontend development, but I hate it. Why? Why do I do it.

04:00:49
<transcript>: i just

04:00:51
dnbull: i did some backend at work and it was so refreshing. Now im questioning if i like frontend

04:00:53
<transcript>: I just I need to hire somebody to do all my front in depth. Thanks for the followup text.

04:00:58
<transcript>: No more languages of back end I'm trying to learn fun in by myself.

04:01:05
<transcript>: Yeah, it's a big world out there in the front end. I mean, there's a lot of choices on the back end, but.

04:01:05
<transcript>: i

04:01:09
<transcript>: I don't know. I was talking with someone about this yesterday.

04:01:17
<transcript>: And it seems like all the backend developers just aren't on the Internet. They just don't care. They're having their life. They enjoy it. And.

04:01:17
<transcript>: maybe

04:01:19
<transcript>: Maybe there's a few of them, I guess.

04:01:19
<transcript>: is prime

04:01:20
avinashsivaraman1: What font are you using for code editor?

04:01:21
trash_dev: Backend is easier now for cookie cutter apps

04:01:22
<transcript>: Is prime a backend engineer.

04:01:22
<transcript>: just he call himself

04:01:25
<transcript>: Just he call himself a backend engineer that does frontend work.

04:01:29
oskrm: But svelte is really making it cool

04:01:30
<transcript>: Easier now. I do think back in is easier. I think it's simpler. I think there's fewer choices.

04:01:30
<transcript>: and breaking

04:01:39
<transcript>: And breaking points and fewer tech things being written. Xano Pin thanks for the follow spelt is really making it cool.

04:01:48
greggalactic: hey we're here! haha. writing Rust requires i be on the internet because im lost

04:01:49
<transcript>: I did some back into work. It was so refreshing. Now I'm questioning if I like frontend. What font? Its operator mono.

04:01:49
<transcript>: yeah i don't know

04:01:50
cowfacedude99: prime does almost everything LUL

04:01:50
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't know.

04:01:50
<transcript>: i'm

04:01:58
<transcript>: I'm I'm really more of an infrastructure guy. I guess I don't like DevOps because I just like serverless apps and there's very little DevOps involved.

04:01:58
<transcript>: like

04:02:00
fredkisss: Prime is a B L A Z I N G L Y  F A S T engeeneer Kappa

04:02:02
<transcript>: Like once you got things set up.

04:02:07
<transcript>: It's not traditional DevOps. I just never worked at a big company, so I know nothing about.

04:02:09
<transcript>: Big projects.

04:02:11
aminunes: Try firacode nerf font

04:02:14
<transcript>: Hey, we're here. Greg Galactic, welcome.

04:02:14
<transcript>: welcome to my

04:02:20
<transcript>: Welcome to my chat riding Rusk requires I'd be on the Internet because I'm lost. Oh, you're saying, hey, we're here. Back into R. Here.

04:02:20
<transcript>: why greg

04:02:26
oskrm: Will you try svelte?

04:02:27
<transcript>: Why, Greg? Why are all of the conversations on Twitter about Frontend? That's the question.

04:02:27
<transcript>: why is

04:02:35
<transcript>: Why is it does it seem like the discourse? Or if you look at YouTube content, like, I'm starting my YouTube career, okay. And I'm starting to make some videos for YouTube.

04:02:35
<transcript>: and i'm real

04:02:42
<transcript>: And I'm realizing there's just not much out there for backend stuff. It's a lot of front end stuff. Not a lot of backend stuff.

04:02:45
trash_dev: most views 🤣

04:02:47
<transcript>: Prime does everything. Yeah. I think I've gathered that it's got a hoodie color for each.

04:02:56
<transcript>: Fear. Code, Nerf, font, nerd. Fop.

04:03:01
<transcript>: Most views trash.

04:03:04
sam_lando: Is it because backend isn't trendy?

04:03:06
<transcript>: Will I try sell Oscar? Were you asking me.

04:03:08
oskrm: backend mostly know what they are doin. Frontend complains and fight KEKW

04:03:10
<transcript>: I think Solid JS is next on my list.

04:03:10
<transcript>: i'm hoping

04:03:16
<transcript>: I'm hoping I'll hate frontend less if I start writing solid, that's the hope.

04:03:18
greggalactic: i think there are just more frontend devs. i do react, node, go and rust but most devs i know like to do frontend. at least newer devs.

04:03:23
<transcript>: Backend isn't trendy. I don't know, Sam. Welcome to Chat. By the way, I don't know. Is it not trendy? Has it ever been trendy.

04:03:27
<transcript>: Back in mostly know what they're doing? Frontend complaints.

04:03:35
<transcript>: I think they're just more front and des. I do react node go and rest but most dead I know like to do frontend least newer does Yeah.

04:03:40
<transcript>: I don't know. I don't know what the feeling I have is about frontend.

04:03:40
<transcript>: there

04:03:40
cowfacedude99: most views and mainly because the feedback loop is easier

04:03:42
<transcript>: There's times when I think I enjoy it.

04:03:42
<transcript>: but i think

04:03:49
greggalactic: it's also easier to show off frontend stuff

04:03:50
trash_dev: there’s not much change on the backend. Frontend evolves every 10 seconds

04:04:03
<transcript>: But I think most times I just feel frustrated. I wonder if it's just I'm tired of react. Maybe that's it. Maybe I just need to play with other things and I might be more into it. But I do like just generally hate making forms every time I have to make a form. If I build a real thing, I always end up having to make a form. And I hate my life. Forms are the worst wire forms so bad. Just like valid.

04:04:03
<transcript>: validation

04:04:11
dnbull: forms, dates i hate it ResidentSleeper

04:04:16
<transcript>: Validation. And like, because like, you can just get something to work. You can put a form up. And like, some inputs. Here's what happens on submit. And it seems like that wasn't so bad. Then you're like, oh, yeah. What if they type this in or what if I don't know.

04:04:16
<transcript>: just so many

04:04:22
<transcript>: Just so many little edge cases. That's what the front end is. It just feels like education to me. Just all of it is edge cases.

04:04:25
2dorkstv: oh man, i feel seen. That's what I'm fighting right now

04:04:32
<transcript>: It's much easier to show off running stuff. That's true. It is hard to talk about stuff you do on the back end and show it to people.

04:04:38
whoa_dood: i find your opinions very validating

04:04:39
<transcript>: Not much change on the back end, front end of all. Every 10 seconds. That's the feeling that's it trash. It's anxiety. I just have a lot of anxiety.

04:04:39
<transcript>: about

04:04:47
<transcript>: About all of the movement in the frontend space, all the MPA versions spa and like.

04:04:47
<transcript>: all this stuff

04:04:50
<transcript>: All this stuff. Virtual Dom's.

04:04:50
<transcript>: reactivity

04:04:50
2dorkstv: I'm never touching frontend again

04:04:51
<transcript>: Reactivity.

04:04:56
<transcript>: I'm just spitting out words that I've heard time slicing.

04:04:56
<transcript>: there's just

04:05:04
<transcript>: There's just a lot of, like, nerd stuff going on on the front end that I just don't follow. And maybe that's maybe that's it. I just need to get more up to speed.

04:05:04
<transcript>: date

04:05:07
<transcript>: Dates. Yeah, I hate date as well.

04:05:09
trash_dev: chat: “I hate Frontend”

04:05:14
trash_dev: watching someone do react

04:05:15
<transcript>: Okay. Two. Dorks you're with me? Cool. So there are some of us here in Chat that feel the same chat. I hate front end.

04:05:17
<transcript>: Streamer I'm gonna stretch.

04:05:17
<transcript>: six hours

04:05:18
<transcript>: 6 hours.

04:05:18
<transcript>: front end

04:05:20
<transcript>: Front end. Exactly. Watching.

04:05:23
oskrm: Did you see fly.io 's new LiteFS?

04:05:25
aminunes: back end

04:05:31
<transcript>: Okay. Whoa, dude. Feels bad. You find my opinion is very valid. Okay, cool. There. I know there are those of us out there that feel this way.

04:05:31
<transcript>: we will eventually

04:05:35
<transcript>: We will eventually build some stuff on the back end. I promise.

04:05:35
<transcript>: it's gonna happen

04:05:35
oskrm: putting a sqlite at the edge

04:05:37
<transcript>: It's gonna happen. I'm gonna start streaming.

04:05:37
<transcript>: hardcore

04:05:39
<transcript>: Hardcore backend stuff.

04:05:39
<transcript>: are you

04:05:41
<transcript>: Are you familiar with.

04:05:43
<transcript>: Vtl.

04:05:46
dnbull: but backend is boring Kappa

04:05:48
<transcript>: Hate you'll wish we were doing react when I start writing VTL.

04:05:52
<transcript>: Did you see Flyos New Light FS. I. Did not.

04:05:52
<transcript>: what is it

04:05:53
<transcript>: What is it.

04:06:00
oskrm: VTL i remember that cursed stream

04:06:01
<transcript>: Backend is kind of boring in the best possible way, though. Right.

04:06:06
<transcript>: Sql light at the edge. So cloud flares doing that too. Right.

04:06:06
cowfacedude99: me too

04:06:16
<transcript>: Do you remember that curse stream? Did I already do some BTL on stream? I'm sorry, everyone. Oh, yeah, I did the planet scale thing. Appsync to plant scale. Yeah, I did that.

04:06:16
<transcript>: that was

04:06:29
<transcript>: That was awful, but we got it working. And the cool thing about that is like, everyone talks about serverless. I just saw a video where they're like, serverless. You know the problem. You've got cold starts. You don't have to.

04:06:29
<transcript>: like i just

04:06:33
<transcript>: Like, I just write VTL. You all solid. It. It wasn't that bad.

04:06:33
<transcript>: it was like

04:06:35
<transcript>: It was like 40 lines of VTL.

04:06:40
<transcript>: No cold stuff, no code rot. You don't need dependencies update.

04:06:43
dendenguy: What is VTL?

04:06:48
<transcript>: We did a thing. We queryed a planet scale database from a GraphQL API without writing any imperative code that runs.

04:06:50
<transcript>: In some container somewhere.

04:06:50
<transcript>: it was nice

04:06:54
<transcript>: It was nice. Vtl is velocity template language.

04:07:03
trash_dev: couldn’t pay me to do vtl

04:07:06
<transcript>: It's an Apache thing, but I use it in AWS services like App Sync, which is a serverless GraphQL service. You can write a graphical API all serverless. You have to think about deployment or anything like that.

04:07:06
<transcript>: and you can use

04:07:10
<transcript>: And you can use VTL templates to take requests.

04:07:10
<transcript>: and

04:07:17
<transcript>: And transform them into things you need to do. So like update state or fetch stuff.

04:07:36
<transcript>: Like data stores what they're called like places you need to interact with data. So it's like this ability to write this declarative declarative file that maps requests to operations, and you can chain them together into pipelines. They get really fancy. I've done some weird stuff in VTL pipelines.

04:07:36
<transcript>: these are called

04:07:40
<transcript>: These are called Resolvers, or Pipeline. Resolvers.

04:07:40
<transcript>: so you can like make

04:07:43
<transcript>: So you can like make multiple http requests and you're doing different things.

04:07:47
<transcript>: To stitch together whatever data you're gonna return to the client.

04:08:04
<transcript>: Couldn't pay you to do VTL trash. I've been paid to do a lot of ETL and it's not so bad. But you know what's great about it trash. The reason I've been like getting a little more excited about VTL and about AppSync and I'm gonna start creating stuff around it is because they're working on TypeScript.

04:08:04
<transcript>: it's

04:08:07
instafluff: VTL sofieThink

04:08:09
<transcript>: It's like it's a transpile step, so it's not actually like natively running JavaScript.

04:08:15
trash_dev: did someone say TS

04:08:17
trash_dev: I like ot

04:08:18
daeeyy: oOoOoO

04:08:26
instafluff: TypeScript instafAAAA

04:08:30
<transcript>: In App sync, but they're working on Tooling to make it a really nice experience where you can write TypeScript and it turns into VTL, so you still don't have all the cold start and code rot problems, all that stuff. It's gonna be cool. It actually kind of already exists. Oh, no. I'm making Insta fluff. Think about VTL.

04:08:34
<transcript>: It's gonna be kind of cool. It does exist.

04:08:34
<transcript>: in

04:08:39
<transcript>: In form an open source thirdparty form functionless. Same goodwill.

04:08:39
<transcript>: check out

04:08:41
<transcript>: Check out.

04:08:42
dnbull: InterfaceScript

04:08:43
<transcript>: Okay.

04:08:43
<transcript>: howdy partner

04:08:49
<transcript>: Howdy partner, I'm gonna make that one like a million points. The problem with how do you partner is for some reason.

04:08:58
<transcript>: My Chroma key thinks it's green. It's not a green hat. It's a yellow hat. I don't understand. I guess. Yellow's close to green. I just now clicked with me. I get it now.

04:08:58
<transcript>: i'm sorry

04:09:01
<transcript>: I'm sorry, but we're gonna do this.

04:09:04
<transcript>: You wanted hate partner.

04:09:04
<transcript>: you got

04:09:06
<transcript>: You got the Ray bands.

04:09:06
<transcript>: just how life

04:09:08
<transcript>: Just how life is sometimes.

04:09:13
<transcript>: All right, let's wrap this up.

04:09:15
<transcript>: Game store.

04:09:17
<transcript>: As a state.

04:09:19
instafluff: CoolCat

04:09:30
<transcript>: Answer does what? So how much stuff can I do? I guess it's just a void. It's just a function. I can do whatever I want in here. I can do asynchronous stuff right? There's no real reason I can't.

04:09:32
<transcript>: Is that accurate.

04:09:35
<transcript>: If I want to say like.

04:09:39
<transcript>: Oh.

04:09:39
<transcript>: i want to

04:09:42
<transcript>: I want to surround all this stuff.

04:09:47
<transcript>: And I don't know how to do it with.

04:09:52
<transcript>: This is where my vim usage is so bad, like, I want to I want to surround.

04:09:56
<transcript>: Honestly.

04:10:03
<transcript>: With brackets. How would I do that? What's the best way? I feel like surround. Like if I wanted to do.

04:10:06
cowfacedude99: Vs{ I think

04:10:06
<transcript>: Indents round like YS.

04:10:10
<transcript>: Like. What? Would I go around? Whysa? What.

04:10:11
cowfacedude99: I haven't used it much

04:10:13
<transcript>: What would I surround here.

04:10:18
<transcript>: Let's just try. What does word do? Wrap around set. Right.

04:10:19
oskrm: Hydrate

04:10:23
cowfacedude99: select and surround

04:10:24
<transcript>: Yeah, that's not what I want. How would I surround this? Someone who's smart.

04:10:29
<transcript>: Them. How would you surround this? Select and surround that's what you would do? Cow face.

04:10:29
<transcript>: you just

04:10:30
<transcript>: You just like.

04:10:30
<transcript>: oh

04:10:34
<transcript>: Oh vs. Bracket. Oh, okay, so just.

04:10:34
<transcript>: v

04:10:34
trash_dev: I’d do it manual

04:10:40
<transcript>: Vs. What's the S do capital V. Okay. Trash would do it manual. That's exactly what I would do.

04:10:40
<transcript>: the s

04:10:44
<transcript>: The S bracket, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.

04:10:45
<transcript>: What I just do.

04:10:50
<transcript>: So here I'm on set.

04:10:55
<transcript>: I could visually select somehow quickly to that second.

04:10:55
<transcript>: there's just so many

04:11:01
trash_dev: v)c}p

04:11:10
<transcript>: There's just so many Parins. You know, there's so many things to get hung up on. I guess I could do, like the two there. And then I just have to go over one like that. And then I could do bracket. No. Why did I.

04:11:14
<transcript>: Do it the manual way.

04:11:14
<transcript>: i'm gonna

04:11:15
trash_dev: vt*

04:11:21
<transcript>: I'm gonna say there's a wrap, it promise it does that, you know, and then I'm gonna say.

04:11:23
<transcript>: Here's a bracket.

04:11:25
<transcript>: You did it.

04:11:28
<transcript>: Go back.

04:11:30
<transcript>: Here.

04:11:30
<transcript>: oh

04:11:33
<transcript>: Oh, do I mess something up? I messed something up.

04:11:38
<transcript>: Oh, I'm exposed.

04:11:38
<transcript>: i

04:11:42
<transcript>: I've awfulness has been exposed. I see what it is.

04:11:45
<transcript>: That should be right here.

04:11:47
<transcript>: Nope.

04:11:47
<transcript>: that's not right

04:11:52
<transcript>: That's not right. Okay, let's just figure this out. We got these.

04:11:56
trash_dev: I’ll come back when I’m 69

04:11:56
<transcript>: And then the next thing I need is a bracket.

04:12:01
<transcript>: There and then another.

04:12:01
<transcript>: parent no no

04:12:03
<transcript>: Parent? No. No. Other print.

04:12:03
<transcript>: that

04:12:06
<transcript>: That's it. No. What's wrong.

04:12:15
<transcript>: You're making this look like a function. There. What's wrong.

04:12:15
<transcript>: set

04:12:16
<transcript>: Set.

04:12:18
oskrm: Prime just felt a disturbance in the force

04:12:25
<transcript>: Oh, there's not enough friend's on that.

04:12:25
<transcript>: okay there we go

04:12:27
<transcript>: Okay. There we go, there we go.

04:12:27
<transcript>: now we can do

04:12:29
<transcript>: Now we can do whatever we want. That was hard.

04:12:29
<transcript>: prime

04:12:32
<transcript>: Prime disturbance in the force.

04:12:34
oskrm: \s

04:12:35
<transcript>: That was some bad image.

04:12:39
<transcript>: Hydrate. I have a hydrate.

04:12:39
<transcript>: here you go

04:12:40
<transcript>: Here you go.

04:12:44
<transcript>: Oh, you just sit in as a message.

04:12:49
<transcript>: Hydrated? Or was that something else? Is that a VM come concept.

04:12:55
<transcript>: You'll come back when you're 69.

04:13:00
<transcript>: Okay.

04:13:01
instafluff: Hydrate a Message LUL

04:13:06
<transcript>: So now I can do all the things I do and when you answer.

04:13:06
<transcript>: so like

04:13:08
<transcript>: So like.

04:13:10
<transcript>: Handle.

04:13:14
<transcript>: New round handle. Answer this code right here.

04:13:14
<transcript>: we can

04:13:18
oskrm: its a regular highlight message because there was nothin

04:13:25
<transcript>: We can say all of this. Okay? I know how to do this. I can yank inside of all that. That felt good. See, you have, like, one of those really bad moments in Vim. And then.

04:13:25
<transcript>: and then

04:13:28
<transcript>: And then it totally redeems itself. Right.

04:13:31
daneoshiga: using vim-surround? I usually visually select, then "S}"

04:13:33
<transcript>: Okay. So I can think about this differently if not current round.

04:13:33
<transcript>: that would

04:13:35
<transcript>: That would be if not.

04:13:38
<transcript>: State, Where state.

04:13:41
th3_l3m0n: how do i have 10k channel points already? It feels like i started watching you only a week ago...

04:13:41
<transcript>: I get passed States somewhere.

04:13:41
<transcript>: use store

04:13:43
<transcript>: Use store.

04:13:45
<transcript>: Here, set.

04:13:45
<transcript>: has stayed on it

04:13:47
<transcript>: Has stayed on it.

04:13:53
<transcript>: Oh, I got to do it in here? I gotta do it inside of it? Oh, no? After all that.

04:13:58
<transcript>: All that we have to.

04:13:58
<transcript>: put the

04:14:00
<transcript>: Put the brackets in here.

04:14:02
<transcript>: No.

04:14:06
<transcript>: Okay. Here we go.

04:14:10
<transcript>: I could just do this.

04:14:13
<transcript>: And then try and move this stuff up.

04:14:20
<transcript>: Oh, it hurts oh, it hurts so bad.

04:14:23
<transcript>: Hey.

04:14:26
<transcript>: I'm not good at them.

04:14:31
<transcript>: I'm officially not good at them.

04:14:34
<transcript>: That was just. That was a disgrace.

04:14:38
<transcript>: Now all this code.

04:14:41
<transcript>: And be.

04:14:41
<transcript>: put down

04:14:43
dnbull: WutFace

04:14:43
<transcript>: Put down here.

04:14:49
<transcript>: Now I can say if state.

04:14:49
<transcript>: if not

04:14:49
trash_dev: trashdevLick

04:14:53
<transcript>: If not state dot round return.

04:14:53
<transcript>: right

04:14:55
<transcript>: Right.

04:15:00
<transcript>: If you try to answer and there's no current round, I guess.

04:15:00
<transcript>: should the

04:15:06
<transcript>: Should the round the option? No, it's definitely optional because if you're idol there's no state.

04:15:15
<transcript>: I think so. Okay, then we're gonna say, oh, this is gonna be async I hope this is possible.

04:15:19
<transcript>: I like news effects. We can't do, async is it is it.

04:15:19
<transcript>: oh no it

04:15:21
<transcript>: Oh, no, it can't end in promise.

04:15:21
<transcript>: no

04:15:24
<transcript>: No, all this time.

04:15:26
<transcript>: I've been doing this, and I can't even do it.

04:15:33
<transcript>: I gotcha Oscar.

04:15:33
<transcript>: you're having me drink

04:15:35
<transcript>: You're having me drink.

04:15:38
oskrm: well i gtg gl +cya all

04:15:40
<transcript>: Using Vince Round, I usually visually select. Then.

04:15:42
<transcript>: S.

04:15:44
<transcript>: Parin.

04:15:52
<transcript>: Visually select an S print. Okay. That's that's kind of what I was trying to do. I think I just didn't know how to pull it off.

04:15:57
<transcript>: The lemon. You have 10,000 channel points. Whoa.

04:15:57
<transcript>: fill

04:16:02
<transcript>: Fill. I just started watching a weekend. I haven't even been streaming that much lately.

04:16:10
<transcript>: What are you looking trash. Deaf. See? Oscar. Thanks for coming. Thanks for the follow. Brie. Bruce. Lemonade.

04:16:15
<transcript>: I can't do asynchronous stuff and set that makes sense actually.

04:16:15
<transcript>: i bet this

04:16:19
<transcript>: I bet this could be this could be a sync? Maybe.

04:16:19
<transcript>: i can't do

04:16:21
<transcript>: I can't do.

04:16:23
<transcript>: Async stuff in here.

04:16:23
<transcript>: next if i'm running

04:16:25
<transcript>: Next if I'm running.

04:16:25
<transcript>: yell

04:16:29
<transcript>: Yell at me or someone else that's and.

04:16:31
<transcript>: User.

04:16:46
<transcript>: Well.

04:16:46
<transcript>: well

04:16:50
<transcript>: Well, let's see. Ten, seven. I'm just got a little bit longer here.

04:16:58
<transcript>: Early. I gotta publish this today. Remember? We said We're doing it today. I made a promise.

04:16:58
<transcript>: so we gotta

04:17:00
<transcript>: So we gotta figure this out really fast.

04:17:07
<transcript>: These sync in Zest and let's see source.

04:17:07
<transcript>: no github

04:17:08
<transcript>: No GitHub.

04:17:12
<transcript>: Async.

04:17:21
<transcript>: This call set when you're ready, thus saying, doesn't care if your actions are async or not, okay. Yeah. So this whole I gotta do stuff. How do I know the current state.

04:17:21
<transcript>: here

04:17:23
<transcript>: Here.

04:17:32
<transcript>: So fetch async pond so I don't have the current state is the problem if I do all so let's bring all this back out here.

04:17:39
<transcript>: So.

04:17:43
<transcript>: There's the problem.

04:17:47
<transcript>: Async.

04:17:51
<transcript>: Async choice.

04:17:55
<transcript>: How do I get the current state.

04:17:55
<transcript>: here

04:17:56
<transcript>: Here.

04:17:56
<transcript>: do i have any

04:17:58
<transcript>: Do I have any way of getting it or no.

04:18:00
<transcript>: Also.

04:18:04
<transcript>: I would I have something like the answer mutation.

04:18:09
<transcript>: So like zipandl searches thus stand action.

04:18:09
<transcript>: t three

04:18:11
<transcript>: T. Three mutations.

04:18:11
<transcript>: something like that

04:18:13
<transcript>: Something like that.

04:18:36
<transcript>: What am I looking at? I'm looking a bunch of crazy TypeScript. Stuff.

04:18:36
<transcript>: it's not helpful

04:18:37
<transcript>: It's not helpful.

04:18:44
<transcript>: Trash if you're still here, I feel like.

04:18:44
<transcript>: did you start

04:18:48
<transcript>: Did you start the TypeScript the advanced TypeScript metadata meta. I feel like right now.

04:18:48
<transcript>: twitter

04:18:50
<transcript>: Twitter, and Twitch.

04:18:55
<transcript>: Everything is advanced TypeScript. Everyone's creating a course.

04:18:58
<transcript>: And.

04:19:01
<transcript>: Everyone's streaming type challenges.

04:19:01
<transcript>: say

04:19:02
trash_dev: lolll

04:19:05
<transcript>: Say, Everyone, it's like you and Prime.

04:19:10
trash_dev: I think Matt started it

04:19:10
<transcript>: I feel like there's somebody else of this streaming type challenges.

04:19:16
<transcript>: Let's see. I wanted to know. Mutation.

04:19:20
<transcript>: I'm able to search in the repo here for TrpC.

04:19:24
<transcript>: Like, how would I do? How did I do this.

04:19:26
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow glad.

04:19:35
<transcript>: Matt started it. Matt started the advanced TypeScript, like when he started his course. That started all of the advanced TypeScript usage.

04:19:39
<transcript>: Redux revoir.

04:19:42
<transcript>: Well, we'll what if I never used it.

04:19:42
<transcript>: i'm gonna use it for

04:19:44
<transcript>: I'm gonna use it for the first time.

04:19:47
<transcript>: The code will be on sort.

04:19:52
trash_dev: he started tweeting about it beginning of the year and blew up

04:19:56
cowfacedude99: I think he got it into the mainstream.

04:19:57
<transcript>: So what am I trying to do? I'm trying to call a mutation. Maybe I shouldn't be. Maybe I should be doing that in React. Yeah, Yeah.

04:19:57
<transcript>: that's

04:20:01
<transcript>: That's a I should be doing that in react because there's gonna be a hook that gives me answer mutation.

04:20:05
trash_dev: Now everyone is cashing in

04:20:09
<transcript>: So this is just when I want to update state. I'm trying to do too much. What does answer, do answer in terms of the state.

04:20:09
<transcript>: answer set

04:20:12
<transcript>: Answer sets the choice.

04:20:14
<transcript>: Is that it.

04:20:19
<transcript>: All that it does, it creates a new rent. But again, that comes from the server.

04:20:23
cowfacedude99: before it was some magic that only library devs dealt with

04:20:25
<transcript>: You need to think like I used to think when I did Redux stuff.

04:20:29
<transcript>: All it does is update the choice.

04:20:40
<transcript>: Of the Year in Blue, up.

04:20:43
<transcript>: You got into mainstream, okay.

04:20:45
<transcript>: I gotcha.

04:20:45
<transcript>: yeah

04:20:49
trash_dev: it still is @cowfacedude99

04:20:51
<transcript>: Yeah, it's not something. It's not something I really care to dive too deep into.

04:20:56
<transcript>: I just don't write libraries, I guess.

04:20:58
trash_dev: no reason to get crazy if you’re making apps

04:21:05
<transcript>: There are occasionally times where I'm like man, I wish I knew TypeScript better because this is a thing that I'd love to have right in my little app type.

04:21:09
<transcript>: But it's pretty rare.

04:21:09
<transcript>: thanks for the

04:21:13
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow Tune VR Tune viewer.

04:21:25
<transcript>: So I really want to publish this today, but I feel like I'm not gonna get it with a stand. I'm not gonna get there. We just have all these weird little quirky bugs with our state management. And I feel like something like this is the right answer.

04:21:27
trash_dev: I’m learning so I can comprehend trpc codebase mewtruCry

04:21:29
<transcript>: But I also said I'd published today. I don't think it's publishable.

04:21:29
<transcript>: i mean it doesn't

04:21:31
<transcript>: I mean, it doesn't run so.

04:21:37
<transcript>: Is that important? I guess it does run. What does it do? It just doesn't have a timer.

04:21:37
<transcript>: we could

04:21:45
cowfacedude99: I read typescript. I write rhinojs LUL

04:21:46
<transcript>: We could remove the timer. Could remove the timer. Make it where you can just answer whenever you want. There's no point. It's just this. It's very.

04:21:46
<transcript>: nothing

04:21:53
<transcript>: Nothing yet. There's no logo. It's just a button that says, New Game. Can I just publish this? I think I could.

04:22:02
<transcript>: There's some stuff that's broken since I moved it over. Oh, I got rid of disabled.

04:22:10
<transcript>: Detector? Yeah.

04:22:14
<transcript>: Do I want to publish this.

04:22:17
<transcript>: Do I want to publish it.

04:22:17
<transcript>: is this

04:22:19
<transcript>: Is this fun.

04:22:19
<transcript>: since we're doing

04:22:20
<transcript>: Since we're doing.

04:22:27
<transcript>: Oh, you want to comprehend the TRPC codebase? I'm sure there's some Gnarly TypeScript in there.

04:22:27
<transcript>: for sure

04:22:29
<transcript>: For sure.

04:22:36
<transcript>: That's a good reason. Are you gonna start contributing to TRPC? Do you already contribute to it.

04:22:43
<transcript>: You read TypeScript. You write rhino. Js I don't know JS is.

04:22:48
<transcript>: Alright. I've got to think I've got to call the Street.

04:22:49
trash_dev: Yeah I have done some stuff already

04:22:55
<transcript>: Do I want to keep going? I could technically, I've got a call in, like 45 minutes. Thought I'd, like, take some time before my call.

04:23:02
<transcript>: Do I need time? I don't know. Are we having fun? Would there be something else? More fun than this.

04:23:02
<transcript>: do we

04:23:04
<transcript>: Do we think I can get it.

04:23:04
<transcript>: can i get it done

04:23:08
cowfacedude99: basically non es5 compliant javascript

04:23:09
<transcript>: Can I get it done? Can I get any of this done and published.

04:23:15
<transcript>: We had a working game. It's when I introduced the timer that things got kind of gnarly.

04:23:26
<transcript>: I do like the idea of publishing something just to kind of like, start iterating on it.

04:23:33
instafluff: remove the timer and unit test it later instafThink

04:23:36
<transcript>: Just as long as everyone knows the data, there's no like leaderboard. So that's kind of pointless. You're just playing for the fun of it. But that's the point, I guess, is you're playing for the fun of it.

04:23:40
<transcript>: Remove the timer unit. Test it later.

04:23:40
<transcript>: alright

04:23:47
<transcript>: Alright InstaFlow. I agree. We're getting rid of the timer. We'll do it properly without the time pressure.

04:23:58
<transcript>: So let's just fix the we stripped out this component. We made it all. Let's just set this able to be this stuff I want to copy in that. Oh, no, I'm sorry.

04:23:58
<transcript>: i want

04:24:01
<transcript>: I want to yank in there.

04:24:01
<transcript>: and

04:24:03
<transcript>: And then.

04:24:06
<transcript>: Here and say, disabled.

04:24:08
<transcript>: Here.

04:24:08
<transcript>: we're going to

04:24:09
<transcript>: We're going to.

04:24:13
instafluff: woo!

04:24:18
<transcript>: I just don't want to lose what's in my clipboard. So I did that.

04:24:31
<transcript>: How would I do that? Let's just let's just do this.

04:24:34
<transcript>: Again, yank.

04:24:37
<transcript>: There.

04:24:40
<transcript>: And then.

04:24:42
<transcript>: Disabled.

04:24:42
<transcript>: well that's

04:24:44
<transcript>: Well, that's stuff.

04:24:48
<transcript>: What else did I say we do later.

04:24:48
<transcript>: at the time

04:24:52
<transcript>: At the time the timer can just go away for now.

04:24:52
<transcript>: let's

04:24:53
<transcript>: Let's just.

04:24:58
<transcript>: Do that.

04:25:00
<transcript>: Let's hide the whole thing.

04:25:07
<transcript>: No timer.

04:25:12
<transcript>: How does it pull? Now play. Okay.

04:25:15
<transcript>: Snowmobile.

04:25:19
<transcript>: Take it plays.

04:25:25
<transcript>: What is this? Proton? I don't know. I have no idea. Billing. Conductor. Never heard of it.

04:25:25
<transcript>: that's gonna have

04:25:27
<transcript>: That's gonna have something with star in it.

04:25:27
<transcript>: no

04:25:29
<transcript>: No.

04:25:31
<transcript>: Vibration evaluation. Evaluator.

04:25:31
<transcript>: what

04:25:33
<transcript>: What is this.

04:25:41
<transcript>: Sage makers. Do you live? No migration evaluator. Okay. I think this is publishable. We can get this up there and you guys can kind of play with it.

04:25:41
<transcript>: let's do it

04:25:44
<transcript>: Let's do it. Iot Events There's no score.

04:25:44
<transcript>: the

04:25:48
<transcript>: The points don't matter. Look at this. We've got a Beaver.

04:25:59
<transcript>: There's a Beaver with a saw. And that's hilarious. I'm guessing lumberyard, because wood. So you can kind of guess on some of these, you know. Okay, let's publish it.

04:25:59
<transcript>: let's

04:26:01
<transcript>: Let's publish.

04:26:05
<transcript>: I don't care it's like so commented out and ugly.

04:26:05
<transcript>: the code

04:26:07
instafluff: LUL

04:26:09
<transcript>: The code is a joke, but.

04:26:11
<transcript>: Pushing it.

04:26:11
fredkisss: !awguess

04:26:11
cowfacedude99: reminds me of timberborn LUL

04:26:12
fossabot: awguess is a guessing game where you're given an AWS service icon and you have to choose the correct service! https://github.com/adamelmore/awguess

04:26:16
<transcript>: We're committing.

04:26:18
<transcript>: Feature.

04:26:23
<transcript>: First publish I don't Know. Set a feature.

04:26:29
<transcript>: But there we go, pushed now let's go to Versaille.

04:26:31
<transcript>: Versailles.

04:26:36
<transcript>: And we've got a to be guessed. Let's hook it up to the right.

04:26:41
<transcript>: It is AW, guest.

04:26:50
<transcript>: Here we go. Oh, I guess I need it's connected to the same database. Is that okay.

04:26:52
<transcript>: I guess that's okay.

04:26:52
<transcript>: yeah

04:26:54
<transcript>: Yeah, sure.

04:26:57
<transcript>: Let's see.

04:26:59
<transcript>: Did it deploy.

04:27:03
<transcript>: Do I have to push again.

04:27:06
<transcript>: What do we think? Do I have to push this again.

04:27:16
fredkisss: You should set your env variables right ?

04:27:16
<transcript>: I guess I have to push that's unfortunate.

04:27:21
<transcript>: Okay. Well, Let's.

04:27:22
fredkisss: to connect to your DB and such

04:27:28
<transcript>: There's something I can clean up while I'm in here. I'll just comment out this code.

04:27:33
<transcript>: And I guess all of this.

04:27:45
<transcript>: The builds everything's good.

04:27:45
<transcript>: cool

04:27:46
<transcript>: Cool.

04:27:49
<transcript>: I just start typing it somewhere.

04:27:54
<transcript>: Still build. Okay.

04:28:25
<transcript>: Just see this deploy to Versaille. I guess it's just hitting the same planet scale database that I've been hitting in Dev. I'll create a new branch in plant scale for Dev. I guess. Still learning. I don't know. Planets go that well.

04:28:33
<transcript>: You should set your environment variables? Oh, yeah, yeah? Frick kiss good call, good call to connect your DB and such yeah? So we've got.

04:28:37
<transcript>: Thank you to Leighton.

04:28:37
<transcript>: for cloaks

04:28:38
<transcript>: For cloaks.

04:28:42
<transcript>: It's fantastic.

04:28:42
<transcript>: we're not

04:28:50
<transcript>: We're not using next slot yet, so I don't need to worry about those. We're not using replicas at all. I just need to do the database URL so fuzzy.

04:28:51
instafluff: OH i need this!!!

04:28:53
<transcript>: One moment, please.

04:28:53
<transcript>: oh

04:28:54
<transcript>: Oh error.

04:28:54
<transcript>: say we'll

04:28:57
<transcript>: Say we'll unfuzzy for that.

04:28:57
<transcript>: you can see

04:29:04
<transcript>: You can see this build failed PMPM run build exited with code one. What's the problem.

04:29:04
<transcript>: invalid environment

04:29:06
<transcript>: Invalid environment.

04:29:10
<transcript>: Environment variables. So I have to add those first.

04:29:10
<transcript>: it

04:29:13
<transcript>: It needs that it builds time.

04:29:15
<transcript>: I guess. Okay.

04:29:15
<transcript>: let's add

04:29:17
<transcript>: Let's add it.

04:29:20
<transcript>: If you guess settings.

04:29:20
<transcript>: environment

04:29:23
instafluff: i accidentally show my .env and secret keys all the time maayaLOL

04:29:23
<transcript>: Environment variables. This is where I'm going to go. Fuzzy.

04:29:23
<transcript>: and

04:29:26
<transcript>: And I'm going to.

04:29:31
<transcript>: Let's see database. Url. We're gonna.

04:29:33
<transcript>: Yank word.

04:29:35
<transcript>: And.

04:29:37
<transcript>: Oh.

04:29:39
<transcript>: I want to yank the whole thing.

04:29:41
<transcript>: So, yank.

04:29:43
<transcript>: Like that.

04:29:46
<transcript>: There it is.

04:29:46
<transcript>: oh

04:29:48
<transcript>: Oh.

04:29:48
<transcript>: oops

04:29:50
<transcript>: Oops that's using the.

04:29:51
fredkisss: ct3 has a script that validates env vars at build time so that's why

04:29:58
<transcript>: That's using the local proxy. So Oops, yeah, and Insta fluff. I do as well.

04:29:58
<transcript>: layton

04:30:02
<transcript>: Layton made a Neoven plugin for it. It's fantastic. I think vs. Code has one as well.

04:30:05
<transcript>: Called cloak.

04:30:05
<transcript>: so let's see

04:30:07
<transcript>: So let's see. I'm logging into.

04:30:07
<transcript>: planets

04:30:09
<transcript>: Planets scale.

04:30:19
<transcript>: Aw guess has a table and branch I got to promote this database has no production we're gonna promote main.

04:30:19
<transcript>: to brand

04:30:21
instafluff: oooh cloak.. thank you! i'll look it up

04:30:21
<transcript>: To brand or two production.

04:30:21
<transcript>: and then

04:30:25
<transcript>: And then I should be able to get connect. Let's see.

04:30:25
<transcript>: here

04:30:27
<transcript>: Here it is.

04:30:31
<transcript>: I'm fuzzy. Right? Yeah. Okay. Connect with.

04:30:35
<transcript>: Prisma.

04:30:35
<transcript>: there it is

04:30:37
<transcript>: There it is.

04:30:41
<transcript>: Here's what I need to put.

04:30:41
<transcript>: in

04:30:43
<transcript>: In my thing.

04:30:43
<transcript>: copy all

04:30:45
<transcript>: Copy all that.

04:30:48
<transcript>: And go back to here.

04:30:48
<transcript>: okay

04:30:49
<transcript>: Okay.

04:30:53
<transcript>: Database.

04:30:59
<transcript>: Url is named of the environment variable. We're going to say that's just for production.

04:31:04
<transcript>: We'll have a different one for preview and development. I guess.

04:31:06
<transcript>: And add it.

04:31:06
<transcript>: okay

04:31:10
<transcript>: Okay, let's try and rebuild, and then I'll go up fuzzy.

04:31:19
<transcript>: Can I rebuild.

04:31:19
<transcript>: redeplo

04:31:20
<transcript>: Redeploy.

04:31:22
<transcript>: Yes.

04:31:22
<transcript>: redeploy

04:31:24
<transcript>: Redeploy.

04:31:24
<transcript>: okay

04:31:27
<transcript>: Okay. Taking off fuzzy.

04:31:27
<transcript>: this is almost

04:31:30
<transcript>: This is almost the thing you guys can go play with.

04:31:31
<transcript>: Almost.

04:31:38
<transcript>: I have no idea how performant it is. Like what is the default for planet scale there's gonna be so slow.

04:31:41
<transcript>: And bad in production.

04:31:41
<transcript>: no idea

04:31:42
<transcript>: No idea.

04:31:52
<transcript>: Oh, so create T. Three app has a script. Validates environment variables. That's cool. Okay, well, that's nice. It gives you some safety there.

04:31:54
<transcript>: Okay.

04:31:57
<transcript>: We're building.

04:32:11
<transcript>: Oh, did it fail again? Failed to load next to us. Next config MJS Invalid environment variables. Alright. Because. Okay. Yeah. Even though I'm not using this stuff, it's still like in my schema and all that right.

04:32:11
<transcript>: so let's

04:32:14
<transcript>: So let's go back to environment variables.

04:32:20
<transcript>: Functions let's see as AW guess I guess I'll go fuzzy just in case.

04:32:26
<transcript>: Settings, environment variables, just gonna add.

04:32:26
<transcript>: next

04:32:29
<transcript>: Next, Next, off.

04:32:29
<transcript>: secret

04:32:30
<transcript>: Secret.

04:32:34
<transcript>: Like that.

04:32:44
<transcript>: There. You guys can see my keys. Well, no, you can't. Right. Add that we're gonna add next auth URL. I don't even know what that should be.

04:32:50
<transcript>: And then we're gonna add.

04:32:53
<transcript>: Both. Next, this one.

04:32:55
<transcript>: Nope.

04:32:57
<transcript>: Next.

04:32:57
<transcript>: public

04:33:00
<transcript>: Public replicas.

04:33:00
<transcript>: license

04:33:03
<transcript>: License License key.

04:33:07
<transcript>: What I'm using, so I'm just trying to satisfy.

04:33:12
<transcript>: The thing that's yelling at me. Discord client ID. I have to do that too.

04:33:12
<transcript>: discord

04:33:15
<transcript>: Discord Client ID.

04:33:17
<transcript>: And Lastly.

04:33:17
<transcript>: discord

04:33:19
<transcript>: Discord. I.

04:33:25
<transcript>: Rebuilds now.

04:33:31
<transcript>: And if you guess come off fuzzy.

04:33:33
<transcript>: Redeploy.

04:33:35
<transcript>: Readeploy.

04:33:41
fredkisss: You can go to server/env.mjs and remove the vars that you don't want to use

04:33:44
<transcript>: Let's see. Thank you for the follow reroute of Givia? Entunevir. I don't know if I saw that one.

04:33:44
<transcript>: tune

04:33:46
<transcript>: Tune by our.

04:33:46
<transcript>: ton v

04:33:48
<transcript>: Ton V or.

04:33:48
<transcript>: you can go

04:33:57
<transcript>: You can go to serverslash and remove the VARs that you don't want to use. That's. Get Golf red. I could have done that. I should have done that. This is more confusing. Now the Gibberish values.

04:34:02
<transcript>: I think it's gonna build now, I think.

04:34:02
<transcript>: i think

04:34:12
<transcript>: I think and then we should be able to play with it. Let's see. I can go and go into settings or I already have the domain to this. I think so. Aw. Guess should already be.

04:34:15
<transcript>: Set up maybe.

04:34:19
<transcript>: Aw, guess, Settings, domains.

04:34:19
<transcript>: yep

04:34:22
<transcript>: Yep. Failed to assign that's not good.

04:34:24
<transcript>: Those recent predictions.

04:34:24
<transcript>: oh

04:34:27
<transcript>: Oh, look at the product of the deployment failed, right.

04:34:27
<transcript>: oh that one's

04:34:29
<transcript>: Oh, that one's still.

04:34:33
<transcript>: Man, I really have to pee.

04:34:33
<transcript>: i hate when

04:34:40
<transcript>: I hate when this happens. I'm trying to end the stream. I'm trying to finish something. This happens so much and then I have to be.

04:34:40
<transcript>: you can start

04:34:42
<transcript>: You can start what is the problem.

04:34:50
<transcript>: So I can gracefully exit the stream in a minute, I'll be right back.

04:35:03
instafluff: YAAAS! progress

04:37:08
<transcript>: All right. Did we have progress.

04:37:08
<transcript>: do we have progress

04:37:09
dendenguy: Where'd you get the brb music?

04:37:12
<transcript>: Do we have progress? I don't know. Let's see. Thanks for the follow.

04:37:17
<transcript>: Follower in Attentive and Irva River.

04:37:17
<transcript>: where'd i get the

04:37:22
<transcript>: Where'd I get the BRB music Breakmaster cylinder made all of the music you hear on my streams.

04:37:27
<transcript>: You should look them up. He's the mistake. Master cylinder. He's amazing.

<transcript>: What is this? This is an empty file.

04:37:44
<transcript>: Needs to go away.

04:37:47
<transcript>: I should have tried building locally.

04:37:50
<transcript>: Yes, I should.

04:37:55

<transcript>: Build.

04:38:11
<transcript>: Like I could just try and do like yarn build right now and see if it actually works, but.

04:38:14
<transcript>: Apparently, I like this feedback loop.

04:38:14
<transcript>: see

04:38:16
<transcript>: See, it is stuff.

04:38:20
<transcript>: Thank you for coming. Thank you so much. Enjoyed your stream the other day.

<transcript>: Just.

04:38:39
<transcript>: we're just

04:38:41
instafluff: WOO thank you!

04:38:48
<transcript>: We're just linting and checking validity. Context is fine. It never used. If that's the worst of my problems, we are in good shape.

04:38:48
<transcript>: an unused

04:38:51
<transcript>: An unused VAR. Take it.

04:38:55
<transcript>: Oh, I think compiled successfully we're there, we're there.

04:39:00
<transcript>: Look at this assigning domains.

04:39:04
<transcript>: Is It alive? Interview guests.com.

04:39:12
<transcript>: No still no.

04:39:14
<transcript>: Let's see.

04:39:16
<transcript>: It says it's.

04:39:21
<transcript>: So close. What about any of these? Nope.

04:39:21
<transcript>: how about this one

04:39:22
<transcript>: How about this one.

04:39:30
<transcript>: Is this like.

04:39:36
<transcript>: Load resource.

04:39:36
<transcript>: four hundred and

04:39:38
<transcript>: 404.

04:39:42
<transcript>: What's trying to load there the whole thing.

04:39:42
<transcript>: maybe just

04:39:43
<transcript>: Maybe just needs a SEC.

04:39:43
<transcript>: maybe for

04:39:45
<transcript>: Maybe for yourself. Just waking up.

04:39:58
<transcript>: Let's go back here. Says it's ready.

04:39:58
<transcript>: project

04:39:59
<transcript>: Project.

04:39:59
<transcript>: not

04:40:02
<transcript>: Not found? Seeals, bad.

04:40:07
<transcript>: What do we think? What do we think? People.

04:40:14
<transcript>: Learn more about this error. I guess I could do that.

04:40:19
<transcript>: Path your accessing was not found in the build outputs of your deployment.

04:40:19
<transcript>: what do i

04:40:23
<transcript>: What do I have? An index page is another finding. Index.

04:40:29
<transcript>: If I say it'd be a guess. Comm index. That would be silly. That was the problem. It's not.

04:40:31
<transcript>: Okay.

04:40:34
<transcript>: Not found.

04:40:34
<transcript>: but

04:40:36
<transcript>: But it's not the domain.

04:40:36
<transcript>: it's not

04:40:38
<transcript>: It's not found anywhere.

04:40:44
<transcript>: What did I do? What dumb thing did I do? Let's just do this.

04:40:44
<transcript>: let's

04:40:46
<transcript>: Let's try running it.

04:40:51
<transcript>: Yarn build in the yarn start. Let's run it with like this thing.

04:40:51
<transcript>: make sure

04:40:51
fredkisss: See the build output

04:40:54
<transcript>: Make sure we can actually run it locally.

04:40:57
<transcript>: Right.

04:41:00
<transcript>: And then we'll figure out.

04:41:00
<transcript>: why we're

04:41:02
<transcript>: Why we're sell is wrong.

04:41:05
<transcript>: Because surely they're wrong. Right.

04:41:07
fredkisss: the build logs

04:41:11
<transcript>: Okay should be running on Port 3000.

04:41:11
<transcript>: works

04:41:13
<transcript>: Works.

04:41:13
<transcript>: works on

04:41:15
dendenguy: Check the settings on vercel, maybe framework wasn't detected correctly?

04:41:16
<transcript>: Works on my machine. I don't know what they're talking about.

04:41:16
<transcript>: see

04:41:20
<transcript>: See the build output, the build logs. Okay. Yeah. Let's do that.

04:41:20
<transcript>: maybe

04:41:23
<transcript>: Maybe framework. Was it detected that's possible.

04:41:25
<transcript>: Had that happen. But.

04:41:28
<transcript>: Let's look at the deployments.

04:41:31
<transcript>: Building.

04:41:37
<transcript>: Static files. Let's see.

04:41:39
<transcript>: App.

04:41:43
<transcript>: There's slash index.

04:41:45
<transcript>: Okay.

04:41:53
<transcript>: Point output build completed.

04:41:58
<transcript>: Yeah. Let's look at the settings.

04:42:02
<transcript>: Let's see here.

04:42:05
<transcript>: If you guess settings.

04:42:06
ajcwebdev: There's a yellow warning message, what does that say?

04:42:07
<transcript>: Other.

04:42:11
<transcript>: Should just be next, right? We need to frame it for a new project.

04:42:11
<transcript>: should be

04:42:13
<transcript>: Should be next JS.

04:42:15
<transcript>: O to be added.

04:42:20
<transcript>: Oh, is it other? Because it's PMPN.

04:42:23
<transcript>: Npm run Versal build.

04:42:23
<transcript>: or

04:42:24
ajcwebdev: Use Nextjs

04:42:25
<transcript>: Or NPM. Run, build.

04:42:28
<transcript>: Use next. Js. Okay.

04:42:28
dendenguy: Nah, should be NextJS

04:42:35
<transcript>: So the only thing is I'm using Pnpm. Should I override or will it figure that out.

04:42:37
<transcript>: Okay.

04:42:37
<transcript>: there's yellow

04:42:39
ajcwebdev: Doesn't matter

04:42:39
<transcript>: There's yellow warning message. I didn't see it.

04:42:43
<transcript>: Let's say this and see if that okay. Doesn't matter. Cool.

04:42:50
<transcript>: Yarn install. Okay, it'll figure it out, right? It'll figure out that I'm using PMPM. Cool, cool.

04:42:50
<transcript>: safe

04:42:51
<transcript>: Safe.

04:42:54
<transcript>: Did I need to save that up here.

04:42:54
<transcript>: here we go

04:42:55
<transcript>: Here we go.

04:43:00
<transcript>: Configure settings in the Cart Production Deployment different from your current project settings.

04:43:05
<transcript>: Wiser production override.

04:43:09
<transcript>: I need to redeploy. Probably.

04:43:14
<transcript>: Deployment.

04:43:19
<transcript>: Readeploy.

04:43:25
<transcript>: Existing build cash. They'll just redeploy.

04:43:31
<transcript>: Here we go.

04:43:31
<transcript>: we might be really

04:43:32
<transcript>: We might be really close.

04:43:39
<transcript>: It's gonna look so bad on desktop. There's just so much about this. It's so bad, but we're gonna make it better.

04:43:47
<transcript>: Ask the beauty of software, especially stuff deployed on the web. It's really easy to make it better over time.

04:43:49
<transcript>: Just keep shipping.

04:43:54
<transcript>: I never turn music back on now we're at the end stream some I might do but.

04:43:54
<transcript>: it's a bummer

04:44:00
<transcript>: It's a bummer. I might just automate that, like, whenever I go to this scene, I might just have to play music on my Spotify.

04:44:00
<transcript>: that would

04:44:02
<transcript>: That would make sense.

04:44:09
<transcript>: The warning was innocuous.

04:44:14
<transcript>: It's benign context is defined. Ever used that's fine.

04:44:20
<transcript>: Okay. Here we go. Build complete.

04:44:24
<transcript>: We're getting there.

04:44:28
<transcript>: Deployed output.

04:44:35
<transcript>: New game.

04:44:35
<transcript>: okay so the font

<transcript>: the

04:45:13
<transcript>: The 20 of us. They're gonna play with it just fine. Probably. Right.

04:45:19

fredkisss: So much services, i'm lost

04:45:57
<transcript>: So much services. Yeah, there's a lot, there's a lot of them. But that's the fun of it.

04:46:00
<transcript>: So you know what the code is open source.

04:46:00
<transcript>: i'm gonna

04:46:08
<transcript>: I'm gonna work on it again. Next time I stream that might be tomorrow. I thought about streaming in tomorrow, but I'm also thought about needing to get some stuff done.

04:46:08
<transcript>: so

04:46:19
<transcript>: So it's a bummer. I would. I would love to stream every single day. I love it so much. It's so much fun hanging out with you all. But whenever I stream next, next, we will work on this thing.

04:46:19

<transcript>: push stuff

04:46:27
<transcript>: Push stuff up there.

04:46:40
<transcript>: Open for PRS. I probably want to look at him. Probably just merge it. No, I look at him. I'll take a look at him. I'll review them. I'll give you constructive feedback. When you write better react code than me, I'll be like, what is this you're doing here.

04:46:45
<transcript>: I'll take your training on react.
