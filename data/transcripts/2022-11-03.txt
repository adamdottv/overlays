<transcript>: For YouTube.

00:17:08
<transcript>: yeah we

00:17:24
<transcript>: Yeah, we don't do the audio on this one, Mandy. It's a whole thing. It's like Copyright. And I can't seem to pipe Chrome audio into the second channel of my audio that doesn't go to the VOD. It's just it's a problem, but I've just given up. So there you go.

00:17:32
<transcript>: I didn't know you could Nexus here. I didn't know you could add block YouTube ads.

00:17:32
<transcript>: youtube

00:17:35
laytanl_: anyone else have ublock origin but the YouTube ads still show?

00:17:36

<transcript>: Origin with the YouTube ads still show.

00:17:57
ohmymndy: Rather pay 8 bucks for verified Twitter am I right?

00:18:05
<transcript>: So I'm using a thing called Loops or something like that. Mandy to do my audio routing, but there's a Chrome bug, and you can't route Chrome audio on a Mac. You just can't. It goes to a random, weird channel and you can't stop it. There's no stopping it.

00:18:07
<transcript>: What I want to do here.

00:18:07
<transcript>: i want to

00:18:08

laytanl_: not anymore I think

00:18:31
<transcript>: You probably haven't seen any of this.

00:18:34
nexxeln: its better than ad blockers because you can have no ads and creator still get paid

00:18:35
<transcript>: Let's do like this.

00:18:40
<transcript>: Oh, did I just create, like, three of them? Okay, cool.

00:18:43
<transcript>: Let's do like this.

00:18:50

<transcript>: Let's do.

00:19:06
<transcript>: is

00:19:09

00:19:15
<transcript>: And then yarn Dev.

00:19:18

<transcript>: i

00:20:26
iann0036: I'd rather pay uncle Jeff for Prime ;)

00:20:30

<transcript>: I hadn't have enough subscriptions already. These are titled Netflix, Disney, Amazon Prime Serato. Wow. Do you pay for title? What is title? It's the audio thing, right? I didn't know people still use that. I thought it like Win Under or something. Or maybe it just didn't do as well as people thought it would do. And they got all upset.

00:20:47
<transcript>: what's the most

00:20:51
<transcript>: What's the most useful programming language, in your opinion.

nexxeln: tidal is not available in my country t3ggCry

00:21:25
<transcript>: So I build stuff for the web. I think JavaScript is the most important language if you're building for the web, because ultimately you have to write some for the browser like the browser. Well, I say that.

<transcript>: Everything's not broken. All the component library stuff is great.

00:22:48
<transcript>: Ayo Jesus H we are building AW.

00:22:48
<transcript>: guess

00:22:58
lilfreezi: @j3sus_h yo

00:23:01
j3sus_h: Azure Working Services

00:23:01
<transcript>: Guess also. Thank you for the follow lazy developer. I didn't hear that one in my ear. Rust says gutsy. Phillip, I don't know if you should start people unrest. I feel like the learning curve of rest is such that maybe not the best first language.

00:23:03
lilfreezi: fancy seeing you here

00:23:06
gutsyphilip: Worried about building anything major on Next 13

00:23:07
<transcript>: But maybe the most important language in the future. It does seem like everything's being written in rest now.

00:23:10
j3sus_h: it's muh boi freezi!

00:23:11
ohmymndy: 200+ euro headphones and some high quality dac

00:23:14
ghostyx101: but also dont follow every trend u can find, u also have a life outside programming so go live

00:23:14
<transcript>: In. Where can we party with you at Reinvent? Great question.

00:23:19
j3sus_h: @lilfreezi PowerUpL ending9Hype PowerUpR

00:23:20
<transcript>: I don't know. I've never been I'm very excited. I'm gonna be.

00:23:25
j3sus_h: hanaxbLight hanaxbLight hanaxbLight hanaxbLight hanaxbLight

00:23:31
<transcript>: Wherever the action is, I'm gonna be hanging out. There is like a hero booth. So I'm sure I'll meet a lot of people at the hero booth. I'll go there at some point because I'm sure there'll be a lot of heroes.

00:23:31
<transcript>: converging

00:23:44
<transcript>: Converging on the hero booth. Or I don't know if it's a booth or like a lounge. Hero Lamb lounge. I think that's better like an airport lounge. I hope it's better than airport lounges, though, because those are kind of terrible.

00:23:46
bheet: +++

00:23:50
<transcript>: Javascript because you can build anything with.

00:23:50
<transcript>: cli's mob

00:23:52
gutsyphilip: Definitely agree with not starting with it. Stuck with JS for the past 6 years but I'm adding Rust to my stack now. Seems important for the future

00:23:58
<transcript>: Cli's mobile apps to sub apps embedded doesn't mean it's good and all of them, but it's useful. It's true. Next you can. You can pretty well touch everything with JavaScript.

00:23:58
<transcript>: how

00:24:01
<transcript>: How does your oh, you're talking to Mandy.

00:24:01
<transcript>: we doing

00:24:03
bheet: +++++

00:24:08
<transcript>: We doing Azure this morning? No, it's on. Aii might rewrite the backend soon. Ish.

00:24:08
<transcript>: not

00:24:12
<transcript>: Not a huge fan of Prisma and slowness on Versaille.

00:24:15
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:24:17
sargath666: we use php, go, and react js - we plan to migrate to react typscript because vanilla js is hell to me - I had to emphasize this xD

00:24:23
<transcript>: Shootuju also don't follow every trend you can find. You also have a live outside programming so go live live your life.

00:24:27
<transcript>: I'm trying to keep up with that. You guys are chatty.

00:24:27
<transcript>: not

00:24:32
nexxeln: rewrite in rust serverless functions

00:24:36
ghostyx101: what do u think of ysqla

00:24:39
<transcript>: Not starting with it. Stuck with JS for the past six years, adding rest to my staggering now seems important for the future. Yeah, I'm gonna be I'm gonna be learning some rest on stream on this very stream that you're watching right now. I'll be learning some rest. I'm excited.

00:24:39
<transcript>: talk with

00:24:43
ghostyx101: mysql, planetscale

00:24:45
<transcript>: Talk with TG the other day. There's a thing he's working on. Then I'm pretty excited. Subdivision.

00:24:53
corfliss: Question: ever wonder if you will do AI?

00:24:55
ohmymndy: Nice, also wanting to learn Rust and Go

00:24:56
<transcript>: There's some little side quests I could go on to try and build something that matters. I need something up front that matters. Like I know this thing is important to build.

00:24:57
gutsyphilip: Awesome!

00:25:02
<transcript>: Let's see ever wonder if you will do AI.

00:25:02
<transcript>: well corpus

00:25:06
<transcript>: Well Corpus, we've done some AI in the last week.

00:25:06
<transcript>: this is an

00:25:08
<transcript>: This is an AI stream.

00:25:08
<transcript>: we're

00:25:10
foobfoob: how do you deploy nextjs with api routes on lambda, do you use a framework for creating an lambda func for every api route or how does that work?

00:25:11
<transcript>: We're, AI programmers.

00:25:11
<transcript>: which means

00:25:16
<transcript>: Which means we know how to cobble together a bunch of Python to use other people's hard work.

00:25:16
<transcript>: that's what

00:25:19
<transcript>: That's what AI developers are.

00:25:19
<transcript>: also

00:25:20
ohmymndy: I have enough ebooks about go and rust but not enough energy and time...

00:25:22
<transcript>: Also wanting to learn, rest and go.

00:25:22
<transcript>: yes

00:25:29
maleero: What is he building?

00:25:36
<transcript>: Yes. Same. I've done some go work, but I want to do a lot of rest. That's what I want to spend all my time doing. This. Sounds like if you write Rust, you just enjoy life. You stay out of all the drama. You're just right. And Rust, it's got a great type system.

00:25:36
<transcript>: just

00:25:48
<transcript>: Just write really good software. Sounds fun. How do you deploy an XJS with API routes on the Lambda to use a framework for creating a land for every API route? Or how does that work? You just upload. Versaille. That's the problem with next. Yes.

00:25:48
<transcript>: they say you can

00:25:52
<transcript>: They say you can deploy it anywhere and like.

00:25:52
bheet: just write assembly

00:25:54
<transcript>: Whatever.

00:25:54
<transcript>: anywhere

00:25:56
nexxeln: adam has come full circle on the twitch dev streamer, first neovim now rust

00:25:57
ohmymndy: Go because a lot of the cloud native stuffs are written in it and Rust because speed

00:26:03
<transcript>: Anywhere you want, but really, it's not a fire Versaille. You can play those two places and soon AWS, AWS is gonna get better about nextdef deployments, but mostly.

00:26:03
<transcript>: you're stuck

00:26:04
j3sus_h: we're building a new binary prototype to compete with protobuf

00:26:07
<transcript>: You're stuck to pulling to Versailles. Do you want to use everything next? Does.

00:26:07
<transcript>: you're stuck

00:26:09
<transcript>: You're stuck on yourself.

00:26:13
<transcript>: Okay. What is he building? Well, so far.

00:26:13
<transcript>: so far nothing

00:26:14
<transcript>: So far nothing.

00:26:30
<transcript>: So far I'm building nothing. This is what I'm building, though. It's called, AW. Guess that was a slow transition. You've got like, these things. You gotta guess what is it? What is it? Cloudy, SM. And then it says, Ja. And you got a point. We're gonna make this look better, obviously.

00:26:30
<transcript>: this one

00:26:33
<transcript>: This one is something with coffee. What is this.

00:26:36
<transcript>: Oh, Geez, I have no idea.

00:26:36
<transcript>: what why would

00:26:41
<transcript>: What? Why would it look like a coffee cup? Corto that's like the Java? Oh, Java.

00:26:51
<transcript>: It just clicked. So when you miss one, it takes off 5 seconds when you get it right. Can I get one right? When you get it right it adds 5 seconds to the timer. Okay, game over.

00:26:51
<transcript>: so

00:26:54
<transcript>: So it's a little rough.

00:26:54
<transcript>: on

00:26:59
<transcript>: On the visuals, but we got all of the state management stuff and the game.

00:26:59
<transcript>: mechanics

00:27:01
<transcript>: Mechanics mostly working.

00:27:09
maleero: No, not this nonsense LUL the important thing

00:27:21
<transcript>: So the front and the back end, we just have to make it look nice. And then I have to add a leaderboard. And then I want to I want to change the score system to take into account streaks. So when you're on a streak, we're gonna visualize that it's like getting bigger and bigger and more intense and more scale that you're on a streak. Don't miss one, don't miss one, you're on a streak. You know what I'm saying.

00:27:24
<transcript>: Just write assembly. I don't know about that.

00:27:31
<transcript>: We're building a new binary prototype to compete with Protobust. Definitely not that.

00:27:36
<transcript>: The important thing, Maliro? What's the important thing.

00:27:40
<transcript>: You want me to build something else today? Not this dumb thing.

00:27:48
<transcript>: Do I work on important things ever. Oh, the rust thing. You may build a rough thing. There's, like, seven things I could be doing this morning.

00:27:48
<transcript>: and

00:28:00
<transcript>: And I just I thought I need to come back and finish this reinvents coming into the month. I couldn't build this offstream if you guys don't want to watch AW, guess I would get it. I don't know if I want to watch myself build AW guests.

00:28:07
<transcript>: What I really want to be doing is working on some.

00:28:07
<transcript>: dream

00:28:08
<transcript>: Dream booth.

00:28:08
<transcript>: on the

00:28:10
jakepagee: I kinda do

00:28:11
<transcript>: On the cloud stuff.

00:28:14
<transcript>: Would you guys want to watch me do that.

00:28:18
lilfreezi: im interested i havent watched any nextjs development

00:28:23
<transcript>: This is a T three app. So familiar with the T three stack. Aw, guess is a bunch of that.

00:28:25
<transcript>: It's.

00:28:28
bheet: cloud hacking

00:28:29
<transcript>: Next JS, and.

00:28:31
<transcript>: Planet Scale is a database.

00:28:37
nexxeln: beta.create.t3.gg

00:28:37
<transcript>: Interested? I haven't watched any next shift development. You know I got cut off earlier.

00:28:39
<transcript>: So.

00:28:39
<transcript>: calf a just

00:28:42
maleero: No, I’m just joking, this looks fun. You just mentioned “something important”

00:28:46
<transcript>: Calf a just sent me over to my desktop, and I wasn't quite ready. I had more I wanted to say. And one of the things I want to say is.

00:28:55
<transcript>: Well, what do we want to do on this stream? I might stream every morning. I might start streaming every morning for 4 hours. And if I do that, we're gonna have to have like a purpose.

00:28:55
<transcript>: i feel like

00:29:00
<transcript>: I feel like there needs to be a reason that I'm doing this like a theme.

00:29:02
maleero: With teej or something

00:29:06
<transcript>: It can't just be what could just be hanging out. But is that the theme? Should I just stop writing stuff.

00:29:06
nexxeln: finish the rust book!

00:29:10
<transcript>: And joking. This looks like fun. You just mentioned something important with TJ.

00:29:14
nexxeln: i'd co learn with you

00:29:17
<transcript>: Finish the rust book on stream. You guys want to watch me read the rest book and I guess do the little examples and stuff.

00:29:17
<transcript>: co learn with me

00:29:18
ohmymndy: Learn Rust with us

00:29:26
<transcript>: Co learn with me. I do want to learn. Rest. That wasn't like the next thing I was thinking on the string. But I could we could, we could do it. Let's do it.

00:29:26
<transcript>: i actually am

00:29:29
<transcript>: I actually am in the mood? I'm in the mood to learn something new.

00:29:29
<transcript>: since

00:29:35
<transcript>: Since we're just gonna abandon everything I had planned, we'll see I'm gonna change the title? We're gonna change the topic.

00:29:35
<transcript>: where

00:29:37
<transcript>: Where.

00:29:37
<transcript>: learning

00:29:38
<transcript>: Learning rust.

00:29:41
adamdotdev: !topic we're LEARNING RUST

00:29:46
<transcript>: And then I'm gonna change the title of the stream.

00:29:49
<transcript>: Learning rust.

00:29:51
nexxeln: rust by example or the official rust book/

00:29:55
<transcript>: And.

00:29:55
<transcript>: building

00:29:57
<transcript>: Building with.

00:30:01
<transcript>: What's it called building with you.

00:30:01
<transcript>: okay

00:30:02
<transcript>: Okay.

00:30:09
vim_cerf: We learning! hypComfy

00:30:11
<transcript>: We're gonna change the title now we'll draw in the rest craft. They can all come in and make fun of me. I hope we got the PrimeGen mustache. That's good.

00:30:11
<transcript>: we're learning

00:30:31
<transcript>: We're learning rust people we're gonna read. I don't think we're gonna do either rest by example or the official S book. I think I'm gonna start just with you. I'm just gonna start with the getting started on you because I want to build stuff that runs in the browser and I think I think that'll be good enough. If not, we'll jump back and we'll find something better with the rest book. Might be it.

00:30:31
<transcript>: the rest book

00:30:37
ohmymndy: Blazingly fast!

00:30:38
aarrjaay: Starting with me?  :D

00:30:39
<transcript>: The rest book might be a little like a little too slow for this stream and for like everyone enjoying themselves.

00:30:42
cowfacedude99: not sure you would want to start with yew

00:30:44
<transcript>: Blazingly fast. Starting with you, RJ.

00:30:44
<transcript>: so

00:30:48
<transcript>: So what are we starting with? Not sure you want to start with you really.

00:30:48
<transcript>: oh

00:30:50
aarrjaay: ohhh Yew?  me?

00:30:51
<transcript>: Oh, starting with me. You. I get it, I get it.

00:30:56
<transcript>: Okay. Since we're doing like we're doing random stuff now, and we're not doing anything I had planned.

00:30:56
<transcript>: first thing

00:31:01
<transcript>: First thing I want to do is fix that audio thing in my intro. I'm sorry, not sorry.

00:31:12
<transcript>: It'll take 2 seconds. It's literally an off by one error, but I can't sink and I need you all to just tell me, oh, minus one, you dummy. So I can just move on because it's an issue, and I just want to fix it.

00:31:16
<transcript>: And then we're learning, rest.

00:31:16
<transcript>: let's

00:31:18
<transcript>: Let's do it.

00:31:18
<transcript>: now i

00:31:20
sargath666: @adamdotdev to me, exercism.org is nice spot to check out, if it comes to play with new language

00:31:25
nexxeln: off by 1 errors REEE

00:31:28
<transcript>: Now I'm ready cafe. See how I kind of like my body language suggests I'm shifting over here now I'm ready to start sharing my screen.

00:31:28
<transcript>: you know i'm

00:31:29
nexxeln: no reee emote :(

00:31:30
<transcript>: You know, I'm saying.

00:31:30
<transcript>: to

00:31:37
<transcript>: To me, exorcism.org is a nice spot to check out if it comes to play with a new language.

00:31:37
<transcript>: exorci

00:31:41
<transcript>: Exorcism.org. Okay, we'll take a look.

00:31:46
<transcript>: No re emote? What's? Re.

00:31:49
<transcript>: What's a re emote.

00:31:53
<transcript>: Rj thank you so much for the resub. Thank you so much.

00:31:53
<transcript>: for

00:31:59
<transcript>: For your resub and for your original sub. All of your subs. Really. Thank you.

00:31:59
<transcript>: the first one

00:31:59
sargath666: resuba emote

00:32:00
<transcript>: The first one. This one.

00:32:00
<transcript>: just all of them

00:32:02
<transcript>: Just all of them.

00:32:07
<transcript>: A resubmote. I should have a resub amount. What is this.

00:32:13
nexxeln: https://betterttv.com/emotes/5f8d26fb473f4802fe473b29

00:32:13
<transcript>: Also. What's a remote. Okay, get out of here. Aw, guess. Get out of here.

00:32:13
<transcript>: let's

00:32:15
<transcript>: Let's just get out of here.

00:32:19
<transcript>: Okay.

00:32:19
<transcript>: i want to fix

00:32:22
<transcript>: I want to fix you off by one bug. Here we go. We're fixing it.

00:32:26
corfliss: Question: do you know Codewars? I learned some Rust a bit with it by some problem-solving.

00:32:26
<transcript>: We're gonna go like this.

00:32:26
<transcript>: and

00:32:28
<transcript>: And we're gonna say.

00:32:30
<transcript>: Inv.

00:32:32
<transcript>: I really hate.

00:32:43
cowfacedude99: @sargath666 You do get other people to review your code so that's nice

00:32:44
<transcript>: In VM. Now the node manager. I hate it because of in them. Like it's too close, too close. Envy is too close to NVM. I don't like it.

00:32:44
<transcript>: let's

00:32:47
<transcript>: Let's go to intro.

00:32:50
sargath666: yep

00:32:51
cowfacedude99: I have my nvim aliased to vi

00:32:53
ohmymndy: Are you using some kind of tiling program on osx?

00:32:56
<transcript>: I've made changes that I haven't committed. That's not good. Okay, so I made some changes recently to just have it play random songs in, like, a playlist. Basically.

00:32:59
nexxeln: i aliased nvim to n

00:32:59
<transcript>: But then when it gets to the end.

00:33:01
<transcript>: Right here.

00:33:04
<transcript>: When I get to the end, it's supposed to.

00:33:04
<transcript>: let's

00:33:09
nexxeln: yabai @OhMyMndy

00:33:10
<transcript>: Let's see. Set the index back to zero. This is my off by one error. So next index.

00:33:20
<transcript>: Equals current index. Okay, which is the playlist index of the current song. Okay, wait, if the song ended. No. Yeah, there's still song. Okay.

00:33:24
<transcript>: The next index is current INEX.

00:33:24
<transcript>: so if we're on

00:33:26
<transcript>: So if we're on the first one, we're on zero.

00:33:26
<transcript>: and

00:33:28
<transcript>: And then the next.

00:33:28
<transcript>: current index

00:33:29
ohmymndy: Thanks I'll check that out

00:33:40
<transcript>: Current index plus one would be one is greater than the playlist links, which would be two if there were two elements zero and one right? I hate, I hate array, math, or whatever this is.

00:33:40
<transcript>: so

00:33:49
<transcript>: So if the playlist links is 20 plus one is one not greater than two. So it should go over here.

00:33:49
<transcript>: and it should

00:33:51
<transcript>: And it should be.

00:33:51
<transcript>: this current

00:34:05
<transcript>: This current index plus one. So one is the new index. That's what it's doing. It's playing through each song. But then when it gets to the next one, current index is one plus one is two. Still not greater than Playlist links.

00:34:05
<transcript>: and that's

00:34:07
<transcript>: And that's the problem.

00:34:14
ohmymndy: We don't have the characters you are typing on the screen Adam?

00:34:15
<transcript>: It should be it should be current index is greater than no or else just make that greater than or equal to.

00:34:17
<transcript>: Maybe.

00:34:17
<transcript>: what do we

00:34:19
<transcript>: What do we think.

00:34:19
<transcript>: might work greater than

00:34:22
<transcript>: Might work greater than or equal to then on that second one.

00:34:22
<transcript>: current

00:34:23
gutsyphilip: >=

00:34:31
<transcript>: Current index plus one would be two, which is greater than or equal to the playlist link. So we need to go back to the beginning to zero. Is that it all we have to do.

00:34:35
<transcript>: We don't have the characters you're typing on screen. I don't know.

00:34:35
<transcript>: sorry how about

00:34:36
<transcript>: Sorry, how about.

00:34:36
<transcript>: yeah yeah

00:34:39
<transcript>: Yeah, yeah, okay.

00:34:44
<transcript>: What do we think? Is this it? Did I fix it.

00:34:44
<transcript>: you aid

00:34:47
lilfreezi: >= or playlist.length - 1 yea

00:34:48
<transcript>: You AIDS in them to in that's so short.

00:34:48
<transcript>: oh

00:34:55
<transcript>: Oh in Calvis did it to V like your SSHing SSHing into some old machine. And you need to use v.

00:35:04
<transcript>: Do you know Code Wars? I learned some rust a bit with it by doing by some problems. So I know I've never heard of that.

00:35:16
<transcript>: Using some kind of Tyling program. Okay. Yeah. You answered that. Cool. Play or playlist link. Dot one. Yeah. Do we like that better? I kind of like that better. Because, like.

00:35:16
<transcript>: it sounds

00:35:22
<transcript>: It sounds weird to me to be greater than or equal to it's like it's just gonna eventually get to be equal to.

00:35:29
<transcript>: It's never gonna be greater because we're gonna reset. So I don't know something about that. Does that feel better.

00:35:29
<transcript>: nice one
