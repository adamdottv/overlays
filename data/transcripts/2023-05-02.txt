00:13:32
<transcript>: I don't know, but it was good. Literally waited to go to the gym till Adam stream. That's awesome. Your health is in my hands. If I don't stream, you'll just not work out. It'll just be waiting.

<transcript>: Having a good time. That's all right. No, it's fine. Sometimes you just don't know you're following. I'm going to convince myself that's what it is. So I'm not even going to share my screen. If you're here for some code, just go ahead and leave it's okay. I won't be offended. This is your moment to exit. I'm just here for just a little while just to talk, because some days.

00:17:31
nexxeln: hiii adam

00:17:32
techdufus: unsubbed..

00:17:38
dmdboi: Riot

00:17:41
<transcript>: I don't feel like coding on stream because I'm not really coding. I'm doing, like, a million little things. So we just rolled out a paywall at stat muse, and I'm mostly just dealing with the aftermath of that. It's not entirely exciting. And there's just a lot of things that I'm back and forth between sensitive stuff, like stripe dashboards, and it'd be really hard to stream it. And.

00:17:41
<transcript>: not just constantly

00:17:43
mehulsharmamat: dont code. i love real life non code streams. feels relatable since i can barely code.

00:17:46
<transcript>: Not just constantly be like, oh, I got a fuzzy, I got to block this.

00:17:46
<transcript>: and just not

00:17:50
cra5h16: Why paywall friend?

00:17:53
saltyohm: not worth

00:17:57
africanxmamba1: How did you monetize StatMuse before ? (Excluding the shop)

00:17:57
iannery: adamdevFuzzy BibleThump

00:18:00
<transcript>: And just not just not going to do it, just going to talk. I want to be able to fit and normalize these little streams where I just hang out with you guys. It's the part I enjoy the most about streaming. So there you go. Don't code. I love real life non code streams. Feels relatable since I can barely code.

00:18:01
nexxeln: where's adam

00:18:08
nexxeln: where's dax *

00:18:08
laytanl_: What if the statmuse haters find you

00:18:10
<transcript>: That's funny. Unsubbed. Well, there you go. Next. What's going on next? Smiling bigs. Here. Now we know how to offend Adam. Oh, am I offended? What was I offended by.

00:18:10
<transcript>: adam today

00:18:12
nexxeln: wtf am i typing

00:18:15
<transcript>: Adam, today is the day I get the MacBook do it kazakh do it.

00:18:19
<transcript>: You guys talking about Barry.

00:18:19
<transcript>: what

00:18:21
cosmiclasagna: I mean you don't get stuff done when streaming anyway so

00:18:25
<transcript>: What nice video about your Tweet. Oh, serums. Thanks so much vibenzer. I made a YouTube video. I did.

00:18:25
cosmiclasagna: LUL

00:18:29
<transcript>: Wait. People hate you. Yeah. So here's the thing.

00:18:37
<transcript>: When you ask people to pay for your thing that's been free for literally a decade. They don't like it. They don't like it one bit.

00:18:37
<transcript>: some of them

00:18:39
<transcript>: Some of them here's. The thing.

00:18:43
<transcript>: It's actually something like 12 million users.

00:18:43
<transcript>: depending on

00:18:45
<transcript>: Depending on how you define a user.

00:18:46
dmdboi: Doesnt code on stream and somehow gets more done on stream

00:18:47
kevinnaughtonjr: but i saw that twitter video of you guys printing moneys

00:18:48
<transcript>: People who come back to the site.

00:18:50
vagorge: do you blame them

00:18:56
annous24466: people are kinda hungry and greedy ig

00:18:58
<transcript>: I don't know. However we define mao's. It's monthly active. We have a lot of users. Okay. It's that means a lot.

00:18:58
jokestera_e: Will you have a free tier?

00:19:03
<transcript>: And it just takes a very tiny percentage of that very large user base.

00:19:03
<transcript>: to really wreck

00:19:03
saltyohm: everyone knows running statmuse is free!  Kappa

00:19:07
<transcript>: To really wreck your day, like they're all so angry on Twitter.

00:19:09
<transcript>: It's specifically.

00:19:09
<transcript>: a certain niche

00:19:09
2dorkstv: Heard you on the podcast worried about starting to code late in life. I just started in my early 30s. Never too late, man!

00:19:14
<transcript>: A certain niche of our users which is like sports betters.

00:19:18
<transcript>: That they don't have any money because they gamble it all away. Okay.

00:19:18
<transcript>: they don't have

00:19:18
dmdboi: Nish?

00:19:19
thdxr: i gave nexx an aws account yesterday everyone LOOKOUT

00:19:19
thdxr: bro no one is gonna pay for stats smh

00:19:28
feenskee: LUL

00:19:32
dmdboi: Betting? I'm in

00:19:33
<transcript>: They don't have any money because they lose their betting. And they use statins to lose more or to maybe think they lose less. And now it's like you're going to make me pay to lose money. No, thank you. So they're very angry. They're very upset.

00:19:33
<transcript>: and

00:19:37
dnbull: There's a saying that says "Never charge for a product that used to be free" :O

00:19:37
cra5h16: As someone that works in the sports betting industry. WELL DONE! <3

00:19:38
nexxeln: @thdxr the dev comamnd isn't working, i dmed you

00:19:42
<transcript>: And I should just be able to ignore it. I can't ignore it. I don't know why I keep going back and looking at Twitter. And I know I shouldn't. I just need to block Twitter somehow.

00:19:45
<transcript>: It just gets in your head. Will you have a free tier.

00:19:50
<transcript>: So we have a free tier. I mean, the site is free.

00:19:54
<transcript>: Unless you do more than 25 searches a month.

00:19:59
<transcript>: In retrospect, that's not very many searches, I guess.

00:19:59
<transcript>: the idea

00:20:02
laytanl_: Twitter is more civil then the reddit

00:20:05
nexxeln: 25 is really low, at least do 50

00:20:05
thdxr: oh

00:20:09
<transcript>: The idea was that it's free. If you just want to poke around you're a sports fan, you end up on Stapmies from Google, and you're like, I got a couple of questions, then it's free. But if you're somebody who uses it a lot.

00:20:10
mehulsharmamat: dont let twitter get in your head. im treating it as a microblog and i think that's bad for engagement but now i have fun there!

00:20:12
<transcript>: It costs money. I don't know.

00:20:12
<transcript>: that's

00:20:22
<transcript>: That's the current approach, 25 is really low. At least 250. Yeah. I was talking to my co founder. I feel like maybe it should be like a daily limit, not a monthly limit.

00:20:22
smilingbig: makes sense

00:20:26
<transcript>: Because if it were like ten a day.

00:20:33
vagorge: i agree with daily limit

00:20:37
<transcript>: I don't know. Don't let Twitter get in your head. I'm treating it as a microblog, and I think that's bad for engagement, but now I have fun there. Yeah. Twitter.

00:20:37
<transcript>: it really

00:20:42
tumtumpkinz: A company trying to make money!? How dare you!?

00:20:43
<transcript>: It really doesn't normally get in my head but you should see this stuff. Mayhole some of it's disturbing people.

00:20:45
<transcript>: Are.

00:20:45
<transcript>: just like

00:20:48
africanxmamba1: How did you monetize StatMuse prior to the monthly fee ? (Excluding the store)

00:20:48
<transcript>: Just like. I mean, it's not that disturbing.

00:20:48
<transcript>: they're just

00:20:51
nexxeln: 10 a day is too much

00:20:54
mehulsharmamat: send me the stuff. i wanna be disturbed now.

00:20:57
mehulsharmamat: oh right yeah

00:21:03
<transcript>: They're just like your site's dead. You have no chance nobody's ever going to pay for this. And then there's like thousands of likes on these tweets. I mean, it's just like it's a lot. And then you go to reddit, and you see the stuff on reddit, and it's just like everywhere I look.

00:21:04
jokestera_e: fantasy leagues are a big demographic I bet

00:21:10
cosmiclasagna: maybe they're upset because you can't play with the search endlessly anymore

00:21:18
<transcript>: In places where stat muse has a presence, we are just being burned at the stake. And it's like less than a sliver, less than half a percent of our users that are so vocal. And then all these other people, we got a lot of sign ups. I mean, it's working out like it's actually worth.

00:21:18
<transcript>: so it's hard

00:21:20
<transcript>: So it's hard to be too upset.

00:21:20
<transcript>: also

00:21:35
<transcript>: Also, we spent $20 million building satnias to this point. And it costs tens of thousands of dollars a month to run statins, not even counting human capital. Like, if nobody worked at samus, we're talking tens of thousands dollars a month. They handle the traffic that we handle.

00:21:39
insanitylater: People often forget that Twitter is like 1% of society

00:21:40
<transcript>: And I don't know. Maybe it's going to cost money, deal with it.

00:21:41
feenskee: That won't last forever tho. People will get used to it eventually

00:21:45
cosmiclasagna: @tumtumpkinz LUL I have to pay for something with great value now?! Absurd?!

00:21:49
sj_se: before the paywall how did statmuse generate revenue?

00:21:52
<transcript>: It's so hard to read this stuff and not be like, Why would it be free forever? Why do people think stuff should just be free forever? What is that mentality that things just don't cost money.

00:21:57
<transcript>: The ad culture like we just expect to get ads. I haven't been reading chat. I should read chat.

00:21:57
<transcript>: what's

00:21:58
warrenbuffering: I mean Reddit always has somebody on fire, it's kinda their thing

00:21:59
laytanl_: Because people are dumb

00:22:00
mehulsharmamat: yeah yk i mean there was 1 youtube comment that got me down but i guess ignore? idk even im bad at it lol. and also yeah like totally charge for something you wanna charge for. people who want stuff for free will eventually never pay anyway.

00:22:01
<transcript>: What's going on? And those welcome to chat.

00:22:01
vagorge: yeah

00:22:06
<transcript>: Riot.

00:22:13
c4248: do you think it's a smart move considering all these ai startups are just popping out of nowhere?

00:22:17
<transcript>: Why paywall friend. Yeah, it's because it costs money. It does. We've been vc funded for a decade. We've raised a lot of money and eventually you have to figure out how to make money.

00:22:18
techdufus: @sj_se dealing in underground memes

<transcript>: i don't know

00:22:21
<transcript>: I don't know.

00:22:26
<transcript>: Salty. You said not worth. You mean not worth what it costs.

00:22:38
<transcript>: African mambo. Welcome to Chat. How did you monetize status before excluding the shop, we have a few deals like B, two B kind of thing. We have deals with teams. And we had to deal with the sbn.

00:22:40
dnbull: I think it's because subscription pricing is getting out of hand. Everything in life is a subscription now which is wild.

00:22:45
<transcript>: That's it. I mean ads. I mean basically, ads. That's it.

00:22:51
<transcript>: Salty? Are you saying not worth $20? Because it's an.

00:22:51
<transcript>: i mean

00:22:53
sj_se: @dnbull this 100%

00:22:55
<transcript>: I mean, I shouldn't say this publicly. I think it's too expensive.

00:22:55
<transcript>: i think

00:23:00
<transcript>: I think it should be cheaper but I don't know I don't know if I should say that.

00:23:00
<transcript>: where's adam

00:23:16
saltyohm: I said "not worth" when you mentioned getting bothered by Internet people lol.  That vocal minority isnt worth the effort

00:23:20
<transcript>: Where's Adam? Where's dax? What if the stamp mutators find you? They're going to find me. I know they're going to find me. They found my co founder, and they publicly shame him whenever we tweet stuff that they don't like. And I know it's coming. And I put my doofus face on the internet a whole lot. So they're going to be in this stream eventually. They're all just going to be spamming. We're going to have to block. I'm going to do my moderator.

nexxeln: im on top of things

00:23:36
<transcript>: Next. What am I typing? Where's that? Oh, dax is here. He's just running to the gym. I mean, you don't get stuff done on streaming anyway, so, yeah, it's true.

00:23:37

00:23:38

00:23:41
laytanl_: adamdevDealWithIt adamdevDealWithIt adamdevDealWithIt

00:23:49
<transcript>: Doesn't covet stream somehow gets more done. Yeah, that's probably what's going to happen. I saw that Twitter video of you guys printing money. Yeah, we got a lot of sign ups, so it's doing well. We're getting ready to roll out our affiliate program. That's the thing I need to get back to as soon as I go up here.

00:23:49
<transcript>: we'll roll

00:23:56
<transcript>: We'll roll it out in the next few hours. And then I mean, it's a big discount for people to sign up through an affiliate.

00:23:56
<transcript>: people

00:24:07
aj_stuyvenberg: roger that

00:24:07
<transcript>: People will be motivated to share status subs through their affiliate thing because they can actually make money. I don't know. I think it'll be good for us. It'll help change the narrative a little bit.

00:24:07
<transcript>: and

00:24:11
thdxr: i’m gonna tweet out this stream link

00:24:11
<transcript>: And it kind of anchors, like the price that we set is too high.

00:24:19
thdxr: statmuse crew i found him

00:24:20
<transcript>: And by offering discounts, now we can get it down to reasonable levels. I don't know. People are kind of hungry and greedy. Yeah.

00:24:20
<transcript>: the george

00:24:21
thdxr: get him

00:24:25
<transcript>: The George, Do I blame who do I blame the people who are angry.

00:24:43
aj_stuyvenberg: @thdxr might be better from an account w/ a better following?

00:24:47
dmdboi: @alfredguimaz pain

00:24:48
<transcript>: What it cost. I mean, maybe they just have no idea what it cost to rent them. Maybe they just think, stat, muse, you could stand that up and run it for free on versailles. I don't know. Maybe that's what people think. It's not true.

00:24:55
<transcript>: It's actually pretty expensive just at the scale we're at we get over.

00:24:55
<transcript>: two million

00:24:58
<transcript>: 2 million searches Direct searches on the website today.

00:24:58
<transcript>: we get

00:25:00
thdxr: @aj_stuyvenberg maybe from the statmuse account

00:25:03
nexxeln: did you see the vercel storage stuff

00:25:06
aj_stuyvenberg: @thdxr LUL

00:25:16
<transcript>: We get I don't know, multiples of that in terms of like, hits like navigating to pages, page views, whatever page views can be kind of expensive at samuel's because it's not just a static page. We're doing database queries. We have multiple systems involved, all the natural language stuff.

00:25:16
<transcript>: it gets expensive

00:25:20
<transcript>: It gets expensive to run Sam use. I mean, it's not like.

00:25:20
<transcript>: six

00:25:24
<transcript>: Six figures a month, but tens of thousands of dollars a month.

00:25:34
<transcript>: And we weren't making that money from other things. So we have to find a way to be sustainable. Like we can't just live off venture capital money forever.

00:25:38
<transcript>: Everyone knows running Sam uses Free exactly.

00:25:38
<transcript>: heard you

00:25:43
<transcript>: Heard you on podcast. Worried about starting to code late in life. I just started my early 30s. Never too late. It's true.

00:25:43
<transcript>: it's

00:25:48
<transcript>: It's true. Never too late. I didn't get into computers at all.

00:25:52
<transcript>: Until my freshman year of College.

00:25:52
<transcript>: i gave

00:25:55
<transcript>: I gave nex an aws account yesterday. Everyone look out.

00:25:55
<transcript>: oh man

00:26:08
jokestera_e: Maybe there should be a lower teir for just a bit more searches for the month and leave the unlimited to the 20$ users

00:26:09
mjewl: you are also moving away from elixir, so that will be more expensive to run Kappa

00:26:14
<transcript>: Oh, man. Bro, no one is going to pay for stats. Smh. It's so true. I've heard that tweet at least 100,000 times at this point. Betting. I'm in. There's a saying that says, Never charge for a product that used to be free. Yeah, I guess. I guess you just have to start as a paid product as someone that works in the sports betting industry. Well done. All right. Crash.

00:26:14
<transcript>: cool

00:26:18
<transcript>: Cool. Wait, are you being sarcastic.

00:26:21
aj_stuyvenberg: It would be fun to review StatMuse's AWS bill

00:26:26
earholesmcgee: how much?

00:26:36
cra5h16: lol no honest

00:26:38
<transcript>: The dev command isn't working. I. Dm. You. Twitter is more civil than the Reddit. Yeah, the Reddit and then it gets ugly. 25 is really low. At least do 50. Yeah, don't let Twitter get in your head. I'm treating as oh yeah, I read that. I've read this. I must have bounced around. I agree with daily limit. Okay, company trying to make money. How dare you? How did you monetize that newspret? Oh, I already answered that. Ten a day is too much.

00:26:43
<transcript>: Okay. So we're getting there. Ten a day. Too many.

00:26:49
<transcript>: Dealing. I guess I could play music. I'm going to play music since we're just going to be here chatting the entire time.

00:26:54
<transcript>: Just a little music underneath.

00:26:54
<transcript>: just a little

00:26:56
<transcript>: Just a little music bed.

00:27:02
<transcript>: So it's not just my voice echoing in my ear. Drums.

00:27:04
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:27:08
grasp5533: Statmuse drama could make Adam go viral though

00:27:14
<transcript>: Won't last forever, though people will get used to it eventually? Yeah, this will all blow over? I know it will? It's just so hard to see people.

00:27:14
<transcript>: like sam

00:27:18
<transcript>: Like Samuel used to be so beloved like on Twitter.

00:27:18
<transcript>: as a brand

00:27:19
cazcik: do the vercel model: only use serverless, charge by resource use  and multiply x10 for them fat margins

00:27:22
<transcript>: As a brand. People just loved it. And I guess you just can't stay small.

00:27:36
<transcript>: As you grow? Everyone won't love you forever. But, man, it's so weird and so stark of a contrast to go from what we were in the NBA community to what we are now, which is like semi hated.

00:27:36
<transcript>: don't

00:27:37
<transcript>: Don't love it.

00:27:43

<transcript>: Send me the stuff. I want to be disturbed. Now if you just search on Twitter, search statues. You'll find it.

00:27:54
<transcript>: Fantasy leagues are big demographic. I bet. Yeah. Fantasy sports betting is really dominated lately. Maybe they're upset because you can't play with the Search endlessly anymore. Yeah.

00:28:04
dmdboi: Can't imagine a small percentage of 12m users saying bad things

00:28:05
<transcript>: People often forget that Twitter is like, 1% of society. Yeah. No, it's true. We've got millions of users that are not unhappy and that are paying for it. And that, well, not millions that are paying for it. But.

00:28:05
<transcript>: we have

00:28:06
<transcript>: We have.

00:28:10
<transcript>: A huge majority of users.

00:28:10
<transcript>: that

00:28:12
two_eight: What other monetization options were considered?

00:28:18
<transcript>: That are quietly accepting that this is no longer free. And then we have this tiny little sliver of our users that are extremely.

00:28:18
<transcript>: activ

charafmrah: Are you working on a football (soccer) section for statmuse? 👀

00:28:36
<transcript>: Okay. Had to pay for something with great value now. Absurd. Well, and then everyone's like it was never worth it. Anyway, I only used it because it was free. It sucks. Okay, that's fine. Use it. Use something else. I don't care. Before the paywall, how did Satmus generate revenue? We didn't.

00:28:36
<transcript>: i mean

00:28:39
<transcript>: I mean we did like some ad revenue.

00:28:39
<transcript>: and we

00:28:44
<transcript>: And we just did a deal with tsn for video ads. It's actually pretty good.

00:28:45
<transcript>: But.

00:28:45
nexxeln: twitter time before podcast?

00:28:54
<transcript>: It's largely been a decade of living off venture capital. That's been mainly what it's been. I mean, reddit always has somebody on fire. It's kind of their thing.

00:28:56
tumtumpkinz: The anger means the product has value, value should be compensated

00:29:00

00:29:00
<transcript>: also

00:29:10
<transcript>: Also. Yeah, I totally charged for something you want to charge for people who want stuff for free will eventually never pay anyway. Yeah, it's so true and definitely ignore YouTube comments. Mayhew they're the worst.

00:29:18
<transcript>: so

00:29:25

00:29:26
africanxmamba1: What were other monetization options?

00:29:28
mehulsharmamat: @endingwithali asking real questions

00:29:39
stroopwafel26: ah some new Internet Drama™ that will be forgotten in 48 hours or less

00:29:43
<transcript>: Some people in Twitter, like Imagine charging for samuels when Chat dbt exists. Go ask some questions in your Chat dbt and then ask the same questions as Fat muse. It's very different. Like for one thing, Chad gvt. Will hallucinate and you'll just get wrong answers. And people want to. People want to say things that.

00:29:43
<transcript>: being

00:29:45
rollie042: Do you block access just by IP, and assume most people that would take a route around the block are 99% not technical enough to do so?

00:29:53
<transcript>: Being inaccurate. It's completely accurate. Like everything we answer, we answer correctly. The data is fantastic, and I could go into it. I mean, it's the same data that Sports Reference uses.

00:30:13
<transcript>: It's a creator of Basketball Reference. Created our historical database. It's immaculate. It's as good as it gets. Literally. It's the best sports historical database in the world. It's fantastic. So the problem is we don't answer every question if you ask, how many points per game? Does lebron average when he's wearing his whatever shoe? We can't answer it. But we're pretty clear about that.

00:30:19
devabdella: what is exactly StatMuse?

00:30:23
<transcript>: We ignored that part of your question, so people come back and they're like, oh, it's not accurate. It can't answer everything. Well, yeah, it can't answer everything. Some things are unknowable, or we don't have the data.

00:30:23
<transcript>: but

00:30:30
endingwithali: @devabdella sport facts

00:30:30
<transcript>: But we're not inaccurate. If you ask, how many points does steph have in Game seven? We're going to give you the right answer.

dnbull: What shoe size does Curry wear Kappa

00:30:35
<transcript>: That's what bothers me people get into like it's inaccurate. It's not inaccurate.

00:30:35
<transcript>: but

00:30:41
<transcript>: But llms are inaccurate because they just hallucinate. They're good at reasoning. They're not good at.

00:30:41
<transcript>: knowledge

00:30:43
matty_twoshoes: but what if i am not wearing 2 shoes

00:30:45
devabdella: facts or stats ?

00:30:47
<transcript>: Knowledge bases. So there are approaches with llms where I think we could modernize the stat muse, nlp, stack.

00:30:49
endingwithali: llms have the confidence of a mediocre white man!!!!

00:31:02
stroopwafel26: @Matty_TwoShoes then your name is a lie

00:31:02
africanxmamba1: How long did it take to perfect the NLP ?

00:31:03
<transcript>: I'm not going to delay all that out right now because it's highly technical and not worth talking about. But there's also cost implications in you want to talk about satin as being extensive with how we do it today, you start running everything through these llms. It's going to get really costly, and it wouldn't even be a single llm trip you'd have to make.

00:31:03
<transcript>: multiple llm

00:31:03
dnbull: What socks did lebron wear in 2013 vs the spurs when he blocked Tim Duncan while looking at the crowd

00:31:07
laytanl_: I asked it when Adam would stream again and it said it didn't understand

<transcript>: Multiple llm calls, like calls into something like gpt Four, to do what we've kind of laid out as a possible architecture anyway, all that to say.

00:31:13

00:31:33

00:31:56
4ohfournotfound: chrome is good, firefox not good. wild

00:32:03
<transcript>: People are like, oh, everyone wants to make everything a subscription. This is not like we just want to make statues a subscription offering because we think we can shoehorn.

00:32:08
llebc: @4ohFourNotFound Loads for me.

00:32:11
<transcript>: A pay per month business model on top of Samugh, it literally costs US money every month to run 70s so.

00:32:11

00:32:16
aj_stuyvenberg: create new aws account and use free tier for one more year, problem solved

00:32:19
<transcript>: It just makes sense. Like people who are using statues a lot. We have thousands of people that do over a thousand queries a month. Think about that.

00:32:19
<transcript>: so

00:32:22
<transcript>: So if thousands of users.

00:32:22
<transcript>: are cohort

00:32:40
rollie042: Did you do research on how any people would subscribe at $20 vs how many would subscribe at $5?

00:32:54
<transcript>: We didn't make up saas pricing or come up with subscription pricing because we felt like we deserve it. And we get this awesome business model and people forget to cancel it. And we want to just milk people out of their money. No, it's just literally statues cost money every single month. So we need money every single month to cover those bills. Does that make sense.

00:32:56
rollie042: *many

00:32:56
l_mbert: @l_mbert Hello am dad

00:33:03
aj_stuyvenberg: Yeah definitely API users

00:33:05
4ohfournotfound: It's good now.

00:33:14
<transcript>: Sorry I'm getting all worked up. I said not worse when you mentioned getting bothered by Internet people. Oh, got you. Yeah. Not worth the effort. It's so true. I should just ignore it. But there's some criticism in there that's worth it. Some of it. I like to sift through and be like, you know what? That's true. Like a lot of people upset with the price. They're right. I think they're right. It's too high. Like it's too expensive.

00:33:14
<transcript>: that kind of feedback

00:33:23
<transcript>: That kind of feedback. It's nice to get a beat on what everybody is. Kind of like leaning towards, if that makes sense. Like when there's consensus. Okay.

00:33:31
thdxr: i’m gonna clip this and reply on those statmuse hate threads

00:33:32
<transcript>: We will protect you. I'm so behind. I'm on top of things, I think you're still pretty safe here, raja. I was going to tweet on the stream link. I'm going to tweet stop it.

00:33:37
<transcript>: Stat muse is a low key mlm multilevel marketing.

00:33:37
llebc: oooo I found a bug ;)

00:33:42
<transcript>: Okay. How was your experience with Android dev? Not the best.

00:33:42
<transcript>: not

00:33:47
<transcript>: Not great, alfred not great might be better than from an account with a better following.

00:33:49
<transcript>: That was a good one.

00:33:50

00:34:17
<transcript>: Stroop is here. What's up? Stroke.

00:34:23
<transcript>: I'm so behind that I'm still scrolling and I haven't even caught up to where I was.

00:34:23
levidayne: How much is statmuse+ ?

00:34:31
<transcript>: Maybe it should be the lower tier for just a bit more searches for the month and have the unlimited for the 20 users. Yeah. Maybe jokester, maybe.

00:34:47
<transcript>: Be fun to review. Semi's aws, Bill, sammy's Drama can make Adam go viral diverse sell mode. You only use serverless charged by resource use and multiply ten times for the same hat margin. Yeah, that's one approach. Even just one bad comment is bad enough to deal with.

00:34:47
<transcript>: i

00:34:57
<transcript>: I can't imagine a small percentage of 12 million users saying bad things. What other monetization options were considered? We didn't really consider any others. I mean, it was always going to be a monthly subscription.

00:35:00
<transcript>: Because.

00:35:00
<transcript>: it's always going

00:35:06
<transcript>: It's always going to cost money to run it. I mean, I just said all that. I guess. Alex, thank you so much for the follow. I appreciate that.

00:35:32

00:35:50
<transcript>: That's so good. Allie. Allie's here. That's so funny. I'm going to ask them to call me that. Now I'm going to say somebody on the Internet said, you should call me daddy. The anger means the product has value. Value should be compensated. I think so. I mean, it's just really simple.

00:35:55
<transcript>: It literally costs quite a bit of money every month.

00:35:55

00:36:25
<transcript>: To build new features to fix bugs. All of that. It just costs money every month. So we're going to charge money. And I'm not too upset about it. I expected some blowback. I did not expect the amount of blowback and some of the things that have been said.

00:36:25
<transcript>: fun

00:36:28

00:37:09
<transcript>: we'll patch them

00:37:18
<transcript>: We'll patch them up over time. But it's also kind of part of the strategy. You can be upset where you can just figure out how to work around it. There's plenty of workarounds.

<transcript>: Stop answering smart questions. Start asking the real ones. What exactly is Status deva? Welcome to Chat. It's a sports search engine, I guess is what I would say. Sportsfax. You can ask questions in English. What shoe size does Curry wear? Great question. Don't know. What if I'm not wearing two shoes? I'm so behind on Jack.

00:39:20
<transcript>: Sounds fun. Chrome is good Firefox not good wild weird. It's probably unused for twigga's out. Most things have ongoing cost subscription models. What makes sense? Create new aws account and use free tier for one more year problem solve there you go.

00:39:20
<transcript>: hello

00:39:26

00:39:30
<transcript>: and

00:39:30
greatgrievance: Tell them you thought about the price, and then raise it to $25/mo

00:39:46
<transcript>: And I don't love that. I don't love that about the subscription model that people will forget or that it builds up. And then you get frustrated. The last thing I want to do as a co founder of Satmus and the samus is my baby. The last thing I want to do is.

00:39:46
<transcript>: create like

00:39:57
grasp5533: What about serverless/pay-per-use pricing of statmuse?

00:40:02
dmdboi: Just ask if them they'd like to accept $20 tier or double it for the next person

00:40:05
<transcript>: Create like heartburn for people or to create angst or make them feel bad about stat muse because they forgot they were paying for it. Last thing in the world I want to do if you're not using it, I hope you don't forget. Maybe we could build a system that reminds you you're paying for stat News every month. I don't know. I would do it because ultimately, it's not my goal. My goal is just for the people who.

00:40:05
<transcript>: use

00:40:10

<transcript>: Welcome to Chat living in a van. I was happy to catch that sound bite about how llms are different. I get the impression the math and precision of language is not the use case for lms. Yeah, they're good at reasoning. They're really good at reasoning. So this whole plugin system that openai is introducing really exciting because they're really good at reasoning. And if they can go out and get accurate information from.

00:42:57
<transcript>: other system

00:42:59
l_mbert: Maybe Pay-as-you-Go Model would help? Heavy users could use the $20 Tier, not so heavy users could pay less?

00:43:04
<transcript>: Other systems like stat muse, then llms can be really useful in terms of like Q and A but.

00:43:05
gitpush_gitpaid: @endingwithali what the hell is that MaxLOL

<transcript>: Thank you, Ally. I don't know. Did I answer your question, allie, I didn't realize it. Ask people to highlight important questions. Please, people. If it's important, highlight it so I can scroll faster. Fpl is the most important to work on. In my opinion. What's FPL? Adam, I need to teach you to skimchat. Yeah, I'm so bad at it. I just lol at people that don't want to pay for software and services.

00:43:44
boyinwoods: Its hard to take money for a consumer product - if StatMuse was a business expense price is less relevant

00:43:44
<transcript>: Okay, what is this? Tweet? Allie.

00:43:45
greatgrievance: the worst are those that know about AWS/GCP/etc but don't really know about operations. They think your app handling millions of requests can run on a $50/mo worth of VMs

00:46:22
<transcript>: That's funny. Servo is pricing for samus. What would servo's pricing look like.

00:46:24
<transcript>: Pay per query.

00:46:29
<transcript>: Joke I made you skipped. I'm pretty sure we don't call that a payball anymore, but pulling off an Elon.

00:46:29
<transcript>: a lot of

00:46:30
hpwebcamable: Did you consider adding premium features without adding paywall for existing features? Sorry if this was already asked

00:46:31
<transcript>: A lot of people.

00:46:31

00:46:34
<transcript>: Have said things about elon in our mentions.

nexxeln: ipl would be so amazing, but where are you planning to get the data from? 󠀀

00:46:41
<transcript>: Just ask if they'd like to accept $20 tier or double it for the next person. There you go. If you don't get in now it's going up.

00:46:42
lesabotsy: I'm late, quick rundown of the pricing? Where can I give you money?

00:46:46
<transcript>: I just realized.

00:46:46
lesabotsy: Hi btw

00:46:48
endingwithali: today im filming a video called "everything i say during the day as a software engineer"

00:46:49
endingwithali: bye bye bye

00:46:49
pbertrand_dev: Hi I have a question about statmuse+

00:46:50
mattmancodes: "pulling off an Elon" has such a different meaning

00:46:52
gitpush_gitpaid: so i asked last time about this and you said you were just testing... did you guys do anything specific to land on the $20 price?

00:46:54
<transcript>: Yeah. Next we got to get better about the podcast. It's about like knowing it exists and maybe like saying things when new episodes go on. I never think about it.

00:47:00
livin_in_a_van: @c4248 do you think you’d write something for the statmuse team to market? I haven’t looked if that’s already a thing

00:47:00
mehulsharmamat: @nexxeln i have no idea but that sounds fun adam.

00:47:04
<transcript>: Never think about it. My should IPL would be so amazing, but where are you planning to get the data from? I don't actually know. Okay, bye, Allie.

00:47:04
<transcript>: did you consider

00:47:05
greatgrievance: it's a luxury good. They can always google for the data they need to answer their own question. $20-25/mo seems good

00:47:06
dmdboi: Replay the chat everyone, make him reread all the bits he skipped over LUL

00:47:13
stroopwafel26: my overcast app knows your podcasts exists @thdxr @adamdotdev

00:47:22
c4248: @livin_in_a_van uh what lol no

00:47:24
<transcript>: Did you consider adding premium features without adding paywall for existing features? So hp webcam great. Call out. Yeah, we should have. We're in the middle of a big rewrite, and there's a lot of new features planned after the rewrite is done. We weren't going to ship the paywall until it was going to be in the new stack. The rewrite.

00:47:27
thdxr: one of our listeners told me that an episode was out lol i didn’t even know

00:47:31
<transcript>: But it was just taking a long time. The rewrite takes forever, mostly because I do it on twitch. Let's be honest. I get nothing done.

00:47:31
<transcript>: the rewrite

00:47:33
thdxr: i tweeted it

00:47:35
<transcript>: The rewrite is taking a while. We wanted to just go ahead and ship the paywall.

00:47:37
<transcript>: It was.

00:47:37
<transcript>: a bad look

00:47:39
<transcript>: A bad look because people knew.

00:47:39
<transcript>: it's just

00:47:41
<transcript>: It's just.

00:47:41
<transcript>: they have to pay

00:47:43
<transcript>: They have to pay for what they already had before.

00:47:45
<transcript>: We did go back.

00:47:47
<transcript>: And make it.

00:47:47
<transcript>: where

00:47:55
<transcript>: Where instead of we were limiting rows of the tables to ten and used to get 25.

00:47:55
<transcript>: we went back

00:47:55
l_mbert: @thdxr Best podcast hosts right here

00:48:04
<transcript>: We went back and changed that so that everybody gets 25 and if you pay, you get 50. So you get more data in every query. I don't know if people care about that.

00:48:04
<transcript>: but we

00:48:05
<transcript>: But we did do that.

00:48:16
<transcript>: So I asked last time about this and you said you were just testing. Did you guys do anything specific to land on $20 price? Turk I don't want to comment on it. Too much bird trans. Here.

00:48:19
stroopwafel26: @thdxr noob

00:48:20
<transcript>: Bertrand, What's your question about sammy's? Plus.

00:48:20
<transcript>: turk i just

00:48:25
<transcript>: Turk I just don't want to talk too much about it because not everyone at stat muse agrees on the pricing.

00:48:29
<transcript>: Is what I'll say I'm not going to say anymore.

00:48:33
cowfacedev: well, the last episode was a something to relish on while riding the bus home today.....

00:48:39
<transcript>: I'm late, Lesbacor. Quick, run on the pricing. Where can I give you money? Stamps.com. So you can sign up for Stapmies plus.

00:48:45
pbertrand_dev: why are people mad? are they money shaming you?

00:48:47
<transcript>: Today, I'm filming a video called Everything I Say during the day as a software engineer. Ooh, that sounds fun. I want to see that one.

00:48:47
<transcript>: pulling

00:48:50
<transcript>: Pulling off an Elon has such a different meaning.

00:49:04
<transcript>: Do you think you'd write something for the Status team to Market? I haven't looked if that's already a thing, do you think you'd write something for zap Machine to Market? I've looked at. What do you mean? Oh, you're talking. Oh, I got you. You're talking to somebody else.

00:49:05
rollie042: Can you roll out a StatMuse Minus where I get even worse than free tier service, but you pay me instead?

00:49:13
<transcript>: It's a luxury. Good. They can always Google for the data they need to answer their own question. 2025 months means good. Okay.

boyinwoods: Price doesn't matter that much if it is a business expense - focus on b2b

00:49:19
<transcript>: I don't know. There's not a lot of things that cost $20 a month. There is one thing that costs $20 a month. And that's Chat, GPT.

00:49:19
<transcript>: and that may or

00:49:25
iannery: "shit" "shit" "who wrote this? oh, me" "my life sucks" "jeez who made this PR? oh, me"

00:49:31
<transcript>: And that may or may not have inspired the pricing for stamus. That's all I'm going to say. Relay the chat. Everyone. Make him read, reread all the bits he skipped over. No, don't do that. Don't replay the chat.

00:49:34
mehulsharmamat: wait adam have you seen my latest latest video? the 3minute one?

00:49:37
<transcript>: One of our listeners told me that episode was out. I didn't even know. Yeah. Oh, you tweeted okay, cool.

00:49:48
<transcript>: Replay. Let's see my overcast app knows your podcast exists. Well, that's good. Something knows it exists. Best podcast host. That's right. We think about it all the time and how to make it better.

00:49:48
<transcript>: well the last

00:49:50
stroopwafel26: ChatGPT at $20 is good value and I'm sure Statmuse is as well

00:49:52
gitpush_gitpaid: @pbertrand_dev people are nuts

00:49:55
<transcript>: Well, the last episode was something to relish on while riding the bus home today. Calface is here.

00:50:00
lesabotsy: Hi everyone, just chatting is here, 50min in, time to work Adam :)

00:50:02
<transcript>: Why are people mad? Are they money shaming? You? No, people are mad that it costs money. That's what they're mad about.

00:50:07
mjewl: Pretty sure you introduced the paywall to pay for the performance hit of moving away from elixir Kappa

00:50:11
<transcript>: They're mad that Samuel has been free for a decade because we just got that sweet, sweet venture capital money. And then eventually we had to start charging for it.

00:50:11
<transcript>: people

00:50:18
lesabotsy: OK I'm out, need to focus :)

00:50:20
<transcript>: People not a fan, not a fan of that, not a fan. We could have done it better and we could have rolled it out better. Can you roll out a sap use minus where I get even worse.

00:50:21
cowfacedev: well, on other accounts, I hate working from office.

00:50:22
<transcript>: But you pay me instead.

00:50:34
<transcript>: That's a good one. Don't forget to take breaks from social media while the flaming is going on. Yeah, grass. I've just got to stay off of it because it's so hard. I thought I was impervious to this stuff. It's hard. It's just hard. Thank you so much.

00:50:41
<transcript>: Who wrote this? Oh, me, my life sucks. Geez, who made this PR? O me what.

00:50:41
<transcript>: oh

00:50:42
pbertrand_dev: Thank you!

00:50:43
<transcript>: Oh, it was your own VR.

00:50:55
gitpush_gitpaid: what did your wife bring? green drink?

00:50:56
<transcript>: Wait. Adam, have you seen my latest video? The three minute one. Mayhel. I don't know if I've seen them all. I think I've seen two of your videos. How many do you have? Chad gpt at $20 is good value. And I'm sure stat muses as well. Thank you, stroop.

00:51:04
mehulsharmamat: i have 4 now -- if you don't include balenciaga one then 3

00:51:13
mehulsharmamat: videos*

00:51:15
<transcript>: Hi, everyone. Just chatting in here 50 minutes in time to work at them. Yeah. No, lesa, this is actually a non work stream, so I'm just talking and I'm probably going to be here an hour. Like, not going to be here much longer, just hanging out, just want to see you. People missed you. But I do have a lot to do. And the kind of work I'm doing is not great to stream because.

00:51:15
<transcript>: i'm literally all

00:51:16
stroopwafel26: I wish I cared about sports, I'd take a statmuse subscription just because

00:51:20
cowfacedev: well, just chat LUL

00:51:22
<transcript>: I'm literally all over the place and it's just like stripe, dashboards and stuff that I would have to constantly be blocking. It just wouldn't work.

00:51:24
africanxmamba1: Question again, in your video when you created the prototype for StatMuse, you talked about web scrapping the NBA site then. Could you have gotten sued ?

00:51:24
greatgrievance: wootwootHeartspin wootwootHeartspin wootwootHeartspin

00:51:31
<transcript>: On other accounts. I hate working from office. Yeah. No, that's awful. Pretty sure you introduced the paywall to pay for the performance ahead of moving away from elixir.

00:51:32
<transcript>: Funny.

00:51:35
techdufus: what headphones are you using?

00:51:41
<transcript>: Okay. What did your wife bring? Green drink? No. Today. Oatmeal. Apple nut butter. Looks delicious.

00:51:47
<transcript>: Some raisins in there. Maybe some pecans.

00:51:47
<transcript>: pecans

00:51:48
olid75: Hey adam, how did you manage the move from a normal job to your own thing/ freelance, seems terrifying

00:51:48
<transcript>: Pecans.

00:51:48
<transcript>: i wish i

00:51:53
<transcript>: I wish I cared about sports. I'd take a Sat meal subscription just because, Well, I appreciate that.

00:51:53
<transcript>: for now

00:51:58
pbertrand_dev: how many times you think he will mention his wife this stream? Kappa

00:51:59
thdxr: adam try to only eat half of that

00:52:04
<transcript>: For now, I haven't seen four. Oh, the balencia. I've seen the balenciaga. Am I saying that right? I've seen the balenciaga. One. So I guess I have seen three. So I've not seen your last one. I've got to see it.

warrenbuffering: Everybody's wives bring them delicious food on stream, I need to start streaming

00:52:15
m2devdotnet: You still have a free offering though, don't you?

00:52:24
<transcript>: Wish I cares. Oh, well, just chat question again in your video. When you created a prototype for Sat muse, you talked about Web scraping the NBA site, then. Oh, yeah. So African, I scraped nba.com before we ever even had a public product. So I scraped inbet.com literally, just to build the technology. It was like I needed something to build a prototype.

00:52:24
<transcript>: with

00:52:26
lesabotsy: Oh so nice of you <3 <3  I'm trying to go vegan, you inspired me. Will try for one month.

00:52:35
<transcript>: With we license data and had already hired Justin before we ever went public. Does that make sense? So it was never a public product off of scrape data, but it helped me build out the technology.

00:52:35
<transcript>: and figure out

00:52:40
cowfacedev: @TechDufus well, you need to add these to the about...........

00:52:42
<transcript>: And figure out how to make it all work. Tech dufus what headphones are you using? These are sennheiser HD 650s.

00:52:42
<transcript>: hey adam

00:52:58
livin_in_a_van: Gotta have a data set to work with

00:53:00
<transcript>: Hey, Adam, how did you manage to move from a normal job to your own thing? Freelance theme. Terrifying. The thing is oled. I've never had a normal job. I've literally never had a resume. I've never applied or interviewed or done any of the normal things people do. Makes it really hard for me to give career advice because I feel like I've had a strange career. Not like a common.

00:53:00
<transcript>: typical

00:53:02
grasp5533: The no resume part is crazy

00:53:06
gitpush_gitpaid: have you ever had a good hair cut?

00:53:06
mehulsharmamat: wow never had a resume. me want.

00:53:14
<transcript>: Typical route people take, but nax calls it the side door. I think I've just taken a lot of the side doors in my career. It's worked out. I kind of recommend it. I just don't know how to lay out a blueprint for how to do it.

00:53:16
zxshan: Morning adam, morning chat :D

00:53:17
<transcript>: Freelance seems terrifying, I will say.

00:53:17
<transcript>: there are times when

00:53:21
<transcript>: There are times when freelance was stressful because you don't know.

00:53:30
dmdboi: Adams been finding all the hidden side quests

00:53:30
<transcript>: You literally don't know who's paying you next month, and that's kind of like the great part too, because there's unlimited upside OLED thank you for the follow.

00:53:31
grasp5533: Adam can you show me 1 side door.

00:53:41
mehulsharmamat: i love never having a FT job, i hope i can keep it that way.

00:53:50
<transcript>: Let's see. Bertrand, how many times you think you'll mention his wife? This dream? My wife, my wife, my wife, my wife, my wife, my wife, my wife, my wife, my wife. Anybody see that? Ovara put that on Twitter. It was so good. Apparently, I had said my wife, like 15 times in that last stream. And he just cut them all out and strung them together. It was fantastic. My wife.

00:53:50
<transcript>: and i laughed

00:53:57
<transcript>: And I laughed very hard. Adam tried to only eat half of that. I'm probably not going to eat. What are you trying to say, dax? What are you going to say.

00:53:59
olid75: *borat voice* maaa wiffeee

00:54:04
thdxr: i want overra do to an "again" compilation

00:54:08
<transcript>: Everybody's wives, bring them delicious food on stream. I need to start streaming. Yeah, exactly. Warren. It comes with it. You still have a free offering, though, don't you? Yeah. It's still free to ask up to 25 queries a month.

00:54:08
<transcript>: i don't know

00:54:22
<transcript>: I don't know. That may be a lot to some people. I mean, millions of users on stat muse ask like two questions, and then they never ask again. So for most people, it's free for 1% of our users that do lots of querying. It costs them.

00:54:22
stroopwafel26: @thdxr you mean ageeeeen

00:54:26
mattmancodes: a Uruguay compilation would be good too

00:54:28
sockthedev: has anyone come on here to shout at adam about the paywall?

00:54:29

01:00:55
<transcript>: so

01:01:00
teej_dv: @thdxr in michigan. lots of the same letters as miami

01:01:15
<transcript>: So there's really no way to know the most queries by one individual trying to query stat muse. There's just not. So a vpn would completely eliminate the paywall. It's not even about IP address. I think it's just literally like a cookie. So there's just like a million ways to get around it. Clear your application storage for that site. All kinds of stuff.

01:02:27
<transcript>: Instead of them just scraping the website. But that's hard because it's something they've had for free for a long time. Now you're trying to convince them to pay for it. People don't like to do that.
