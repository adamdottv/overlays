So I did my office, but my wife did her house, which looks way cooler, like I ended up with some weird mid century theme in my office. That wasn't necessarily what I was originally setting out for.

00:13:29

00:13:31

00:17:33
<transcript>: so adam i think i'm pushing that project to the back burner for a bit i want to focus on employable qualities instead of a potential startup so i can get my money up yeah good grandpa

00:17:37
<transcript>: I have so many conflicting thoughts. It's hard for me.

00:17:41
<transcript>: With startups on the one hand.

00:17:41
<transcript>: i feel like at the

00:17:50
<transcript>: I feel like at the beginning of your career is a great time to start a startup because presumably at the beginning of your career, you're younger. You don't have a lot of responsibilities in life.

00:17:54
<transcript>: You don't have maybe a significant other or potentially children.

00:18:00
<transcript>: Just like early in life, I had a lot less on my plate, a lot less things required of me.

00:18:04
<transcript>: So that's a great time to start a startup. On the other hand.

00:18:18
<transcript>: I feel like it's nice to have built up some savings and to not feel like I don't know you're not at a good position to start a startup if you can live with your parents or live somewhere else with a friend.

00:18:18
<transcript>: for

00:18:23
<transcript>: For very cheap then I think startups are great to get going to get started.

00:18:23
<transcript>: i didn't really

00:18:23
kampouse: if i fail am done

00:18:28
<transcript>: I didn't really have that. Like I got married. We were going to live on our own.

00:18:28
<transcript>: so

00:18:29
<transcript>: So.

00:18:29
<transcript>: i needed to kind of

00:18:36
<transcript>: I needed to kind of get my feet. We didn't start with money, started with nothing, and had to kind of.

00:18:36
<transcript>: build up

00:18:52
<transcript>: Build up some savings, but, yeah, I'm torn on when people should start startups. Seeing the footage of your office makes me want an entire house tour. Yeah. Kevin, we've talked about it. I've got, like, a little mobile setup. I've got a jib and a wireless hdmi thing. I could walk around the house with my camera.

00:18:52
<transcript>: the main

00:20:13
<transcript>: Excuse me? My wife has plans for the money that I made.

I want to make a plug in that doesn't allow you to delete or undo anything from the buffer. You can only add to it. Okay. So I can only move forward in the buffer and.

12:55:25
<transcript>: the reason

12:55:32
kevinnaughtonjr: i feel like teej looks younger

12:55:32
sockthedev: made me look at the code a bit more. actually looks great to write them in lua

12:55:33
<transcript>: The reason is I want to try and build like a whole app where I can't make a mistake. Like if you hit a wrong career, then you got to figure out how to make it work.

12:55:33
<transcript>: without delet

12:55:37
<transcript>: Without deleting or undoing anything. Does that make sense.

12:55:41
<transcript>: I want to call it like pain, pain. Nvim. Or something.

12:55:57

12:57:00
teej_dv: @kevinnaughtonjr nice! haha it was fun for awhile but i'm happy to be back with short hair i think

12:57:15
<transcript>: You could been working on this buffer for like an hour, this file that needs to exist in your app and then you make one faulty like misstep one key that you didn't mean to type. And now you either got to delete the whole buffer and start over or.

12:57:28
<transcript>: You've got to somehow insert more characters to make it work. And I think somebody said you could just comment everything out. And maybe you could just end up commenting everything out. And that's the workaround that's the hard part is thinking of how to make it.

12:57:28
<transcript>: like airt

12:57:29

sylverl: @Kryotoboi some people are stubborn

13:00:19
<transcript>: I had a colleague who only committed code after finishing the feature. So every feature was just one commit once he lost all the code because his hard disk crash. Oh, no.

13:00:22
<transcript>: That's awful. That's like my nightmare.

13:00:25
ocelot2123: may I ask so who's paying you to build a feature on your own website? LUL I was so confused by you tweet

13:00:41
<transcript>: Client side rendered.

13:00:41
<transcript>: why do i not

13:00:46
<transcript>: Why do I not want to work here, up here? Well, because it's going to be like a button.

13:00:48
<transcript>: It's going to be like.

13:00:51
<transcript>: This avatar thing right here.

13:00:54
<transcript>: It's actually just like that the avatar.

13:00:59
<transcript>: Avatar.

dmdboi: Help, Im opening Android Studio again

13:01:06
<transcript>: Just like this component, it's going to be like a clickable. Oh, there's no action to use.

<transcript>: Okay. Focus at them. Just got to do it. Just got to make it happen.

13:02:03
<transcript>: Just got to make it happen.

13:02:11
<transcript>: I think what I want to do is just always pass in this component.

13:02:15
<transcript>: We need to make like a fixed size.

13:02:19
<transcript>: Needs to just be a fixed size so that.

13:02:28
<transcript>: Well, no, I can't do that. I was just thinking I could avoid some of the layout shift, but can't do that.

13:02:37
<transcript>: Okay. Bummer. Bummer. This is way more work than I thought it was going to be way more. Go back home.

13:02:41
<transcript>: So there it looks fine.

13:02:41
<transcript>: because

13:02:44
<transcript>: Because there's plenty of space there.

13:02:44
<transcript>: it's just

13:02:47
<transcript>: It's just when the search bar is up there.

13:02:55
<transcript>: Like I should leave that because we've got a burger icon right here already. Oh, interesting. Yeah, it's only on.

13:02:58
<transcript>: This page.

13:02:58
<transcript>: you might

13:03:10

13:03:31
<transcript>: that's

thdxr: also did you see miami knocked out the #1 seed

13:03:52
<transcript>: So I work at Status now. I am a co founder. I did co found sat mews, but I am not in a leadership position anymore. I just work there. Just individual contributor.

13:03:52
<transcript>: i'm

13:03:55
<transcript>: I'm not even like an employer or an employee.

13:03:56

13:03:58
sylverl: LUL

13:04:05
<transcript>: I'm not like a full time employee. I'm a contractor. I just happen to spend all my time working on it. I'm doing full time work. But in a contract relationship.

13:04:08
<transcript>: So.

13:04:13
<transcript>: I was the cto when we started the company.

13:04:13
<transcript>: for five years

13:04:14
<transcript>: For five years.

13:04:14
trivenge: yeah heat beat out the giannis

13:04:23
cosmiclasagna: @thdxr so sad about this

13:04:23
<transcript>: And my co founder was the CEO. We parted ways after five years. He fired me. He had to. We hated each other. It was very toxic.

13:04:34
trivenge: and crew. tbh, i kind of expected that though. heat has a bit more rounded roster

13:04:37
<transcript>: We were ruining everything about the company because we hated each other. And that was just like a lot of things that built up over five years. It'll happen. It's an interesting relationship you have with your co founder, and we've known each other our whole lives. So it's like stuff that goes way back.

13:04:37
<transcript>: so after

13:04:39
<transcript>: So after five years.

13:04:39
<transcript>: we had to

13:04:41
<transcript>: We had to part ways.

13:04:41
<transcript>: and that looked like

13:04:41
thdxr: i live in miami so ha ha loooosseeerrrr

13:04:46
<transcript>: And that looked like me leaving statues. And I was gone for three years. I've just come back.

13:04:46
<transcript>: over the last

13:04:51
<transcript>: Over the last three years, our relationship has been restored. We're in a much better place now.

13:04:53
thdxr: everyone forgets about playoff jimmy

13:04:53
trivenge: oh miami must be excited lol

13:04:56
thdxr: what a monster

13:05:01
<transcript>: And he asked someone to come back and just work on stuff, not have to deal with any of the leadership side of it. Decision making. None of that. I just get to build.

13:05:01
<transcript>: so

13:05:03
cosmiclasagna: and up against new york in the next round too damn it

13:05:03
<transcript>: So in that sense.

13:05:08
<transcript>: I'm just like any other individual contributor, just because.

13:05:08
<transcript>: i own a chunk

13:05:08
matty_twoshoes: oh wow interesting. my ex-cofounder and i fought intensely when we founded, despite knowing each other for 8 years beforehand

13:05:14
<transcript>: I own a chunk of it. Doesn't make that any different. And he incentivized me to ship this thing really fast.

13:05:14
<transcript>: that's all

13:05:16
<transcript>: That's all Texas. Here.

13:05:20

13:07:58
<transcript>: Nexus here. I like that you led with nexus here. Next. That's awesome. It's kind of like Kiwi and kiwi's. Like, Hi, I'm Kiwi.

13:07:58

13:08:02
cosmiclasagna: game literally only turned around in the last 5 mins

13:08:13
<transcript>: Auton. Welcome to Chat. That exactly thing happened to my friend co founder company. And the friendship started going, shit. Yeah, it does. It goes down the drain quickly, madame. I'm Adam is a palindrome. Oh, is it.

13:08:21
<transcript>: I've never said that, though. Why not? Madame? I'm Adam. You should have said that. Common sentiment.

13:08:30
<transcript>: Stress, finances, a lot of things get in the way of relationships. It's so true, Sammy just tweets about Jimmy Butler was going pretty viral the past couple of days yet.

13:08:34

13:08:48
2dorkstv: It's kind of like how you shouldn't be roommates with your best friends :P

13:08:48

<transcript>: it's just

13:08:55
nexxeln: is twitter time already over?

<transcript>: i mean

13:09:00
<transcript>: I mean, I'm glad that they are. It's great.

13:09:13
<transcript>: But like all these tweets get so much engagement, apparently, talk about sports. That's the secret on the Internet. Just talk about sports. I use stampings for the first time this week to look up that Butler scored 56 points in the game. Look at you, DAX.

13:09:13

thdxr: i gotta use statmuse before the immoral paywall goes up

13:09:54
<transcript>: But those rest, the rest of those guys are young. I guess I've heard of rj. Barrett and julius randall. Oh, and Josh Hart. Yeah. Okay. I know that crew. How do you even find the energy to work on the business after that? I feel like entrepreneuring is so draining, especially when it doesn't work because of people. Mostly everything in life doesn't work because of people at the end of the day. That's why it ends up not working.

13:10:20

Exactly. Is Twitter time already over? No, we haven't even started. I haven't even started Twitter time. Next. I was just showing a statue suite.

13:11:05

13:11:12
nexxeln: okay i did my tweets

13:11:25
<transcript>: Okay. Here we go. You did your Tweets next. Thank you. You're so good at Twitter.

13:11:30
<transcript>: All right, it's time to actually.

13:11:30
<transcript>: let's get

13:11:36
<transcript>: Let's get this done, avatar. This just needs to be done. Root not home.

13:11:39
<transcript>: Oh, my goodness.

13:11:47
<transcript>: Kids are jumping out of bed. Fantasy football. We have a separate fantasy football page. That's annoying. Okay, I guess it's fine.

13:11:47
<transcript>: root in

13:11:49
<transcript>: Root in.

13:11:51
<transcript>: X versus root header.

13:11:54
<transcript>: Which one is.

13:12:01
smilingbig: so when are we trying a new colourscheme?

13:12:02
<transcript>: Surprising. Oh, finance. That's finance. Okay, root header. This is the main one. This is the one I want to fix first.

13:12:09
<transcript>: Fix this one right now it's that that is going to become all client side generated stuff.

13:12:12
<transcript>: If get current user.

13:12:20
<transcript>: Okay. Now we're just going to do the avatar regardless. And instead of passing in the URL.

13:12:20
<transcript>: we're going to

13:12:22
<transcript>: We're going to pass in.

thdxr: adam are you down to record today when you’re done streaming?

13:12:42
<transcript>: Adam, are you down to record today? When you're done streaming? Yes, dax, 100%. We got to do a podcast.

13:12:59
<transcript>: Adam, I was wondering what's sammy's approaches to seo like, how do you index the search query pages when they are essentially endless and user initiated? So layton, we generate a sitemap with tons of just pre generated like common stack questions. So we have this huge dynamic sitemap.

13:12:59
<transcript>: but

13:13:05
<transcript>: But then also I think Google just picks stuff up as it wants to. We have some pages.

13:13:05
<transcript>: like at

13:13:07
<transcript>: Like at the bottom of.

13:13:24
trivenge: casey neistats podcast appearance on flagrant with andrew schulz was FireSpeed sirgadRaveit pikabooFire

13:13:26
<transcript>: Every query like at the every answer there's these like here's some questions you could try as well. So those links are on every page. So it kind of sprawls out and spiders out to all these other types of questions. And then the trending is just one giant page paginated thing of everything everyone asks.

13:13:26
<transcript>: okay

13:13:29
<transcript>: Okay. So this is like as people ask questions.

13:13:39
thdxr: that site map must be massive

13:13:40
<transcript>: They show up here in this training page. So it's like one paginated list of every question. So ultimately there's links to every page scattered all over the place.

13:13:40
<transcript>: and

13:13:42
<transcript>: And that's kind of how it works.

13:14:00
<transcript>: Where is the channel point? Redemption for that. Everyone wants a macbook Pro. I just want one of adam's keyboards. Yeah. When are we trying a new color scheme? Smiling. When I build my next keyboard, I'm going to put a different color scheme on the keycaps. I think I know what koshi I'm going to use.

13:14:01
smilingbig: KEKW

13:14:04
laytanl_: So interesting

13:14:10
<transcript>: And I'm going to change my editor theme. I'm going to move away from dracula if I like the sound of this keyboard as much, if it sounds as good, I'll actually use it.

13:14:14
<transcript>: And it's a sonnet. So I like the layout and everything.

13:14:14
<transcript>: casey

13:14:19
<transcript>: Casey neistat's podcast appearance on flagrant with Andrew scholes. Was fire.

13:14:21
laytanl_: So you keep track of the most popular questions and put those in a sitemap?

13:14:21
thdxr: wow moving away from dracula?

13:14:24
<transcript>: I like Casey neistat. That sitemap must be massive. Yeah, it's huge.

13:14:29
thdxr: we got to you yesterday huh

13:14:31
<transcript>: Huge. Yeah, moving away from Jacket le yetx I think it's time I think after yesterday when you shamed me.

13:14:31

daglee: Laptop? Keyboard? What I want is adams lärabars!

13:14:44
mecoupz: everyone else: yeah lets change theme. adam: changing theme? then i need to build a new keyboard

13:14:46
mecoupz: LUL

13:14:47
<transcript>: Over using dracula. I think it's time to move on. We got you. Yeah, you got to me. So you keep track of the most popular questions. Put those in the sitemap. Yeah. Layton. It's a mix of popular questions people have asked and questions we just want to make sure we index for so, like with just a bunch of common sports stats, questions.

13:14:51
<transcript>: That's basically how it works. Okay.

13:14:58
<transcript>: Same thing. I need to build new keyboards. Yeah. I'm kind of weird. Like that. I do things like that.

13:15:02
<transcript>: Oh, I'm just distracted because I want to be.

13:15:02
<transcript>: url this is

13:15:04
<transcript>: Url. This is not needed anymore.

13:15:08
<transcript>: I'm just going to remove that.

13:15:21
<transcript>: So avatar I'm going to rename that probably, but we're just going to pass in the current user somehow.

13:15:23
<transcript>: User.

13:15:25
<transcript>: Equals.

13:15:30
<transcript>: How do I want to do this.

13:15:32
laytanl_: Cool thanks!

13:15:37
<transcript>: Just user ID. Maybe just so that, you know, there is a user, because that's all it needs to know is that there is a user, right.

13:15:40
<transcript>: We don't actually have any avatars right now.

13:15:44
<transcript>: User is.

13:15:51
<transcript>: Hang on. I'm going to do this. Let's go to root controller.

13:15:54
<transcript>: Root Controller or root view.

13:16:03
<transcript>: More than one root view. Of course there is client way. Okay, this is the one. Let's just pass in.

13:16:07
<transcript>: Let's just pass in the.

13:16:07
<transcript>: user

13:16:09
<transcript>: User.

13:16:09
<transcript>: here

13:16:11
<transcript>: Here. Wait. What.

13:16:16
<transcript>: Is it in the controller? Oh, maybe it's in the controller.

13:16:16
dmdboi: I got flutter working

13:16:18
<transcript>: Root controller.

13:16:19
dmdboi: This is a great day

13:16:23
<transcript>: This is. I'm getting familiar with this code base. I'm going to never work in it again.

13:16:23
<transcript>: that's the ap

13:16:26
<transcript>: That's the api controller root controller.

<transcript>: What would it be.

13:16:36
<transcript>: petter

13:16:54
<transcript>: rid

13:16:57
<transcript>: Riddle me. That. Where is it.

13:16:57
<transcript>: if it's not any of

13:16:59
<transcript>: If it's not any of those places.

13:17:06
<transcript>: So what do we have here? We have render ask bar.

13:17:06
<transcript>: client

13:17:08
<transcript>: Client Home path.

13:17:14
<transcript>: This is the header. What.

13:17:16
<transcript>: Is the.

13:17:20
<transcript>: Place where we pass in stuff to it.

13:17:21
goodgrandpaa: wow, I thought the harvard cs50 free course on youtube was all hype, but I am kind of enjoying it LUL

13:17:24
<transcript>: Oh, layout. I bet it's layout. Maybe.

13:17:26
<transcript>: The layout.

13:17:28
<transcript>: Let's see.

13:17:33
cosmiclasagna: brb gonna go through meetings NotLikeThis

13:17:36
<transcript>: Header. Let's search for render header.

13:17:45
<transcript>: What about header, header. Html. There we go.

13:17:47
<transcript>: Oh, no, is it on every page.

13:17:49
<transcript>: What.

13:17:52
<transcript>: It is.

13:17:55
<transcript>: What.

13:17:58
<transcript>: This is so annoying.

13:18:05
<transcript>: Oh, it's so annoying. So I guess we're going to do this. I guess we're going to do get current user.

13:18:05
mattmancodes: haha

13:18:08
<transcript>: Okay. How about this? How about this.

13:18:11
<transcript>: What a mess.

13:18:11
<transcript>: what about

13:18:13
<transcript>: What about this.

13:18:16
<transcript>: Okay.

13:18:16
<transcript>: and then

13:18:18
nexxeln: !lurk

13:18:21
<transcript>: And then we just don't have a user on this one. So if there is no user.

13:18:25
<transcript>: But I need to set that to something.

13:18:25
<transcript>: how do i set that

13:18:28
<transcript>: How do I set that to something.

13:18:30
<transcript>: Lurk away people lurk away.

13:18:30
<transcript>: i'm

13:18:36
<transcript>: I'm deep in thought I'm getting lost in this code let's see.

13:18:47
<transcript>: I got flutter working. Great day. All right, diamond. I'm hoping my day is going to turn around here soon. Change the macbook code to be 100% just so we can be sure it's not scanned. Good idea, Darren.

13:18:51
<transcript>: Okay.

13:18:54
<transcript>: I don't love this.

13:18:54
<transcript>: i don't know

13:18:56
<transcript>: I don't know what to do here.

13:19:01
<transcript>: I'm going to just do it like this.

13:19:04
<transcript>: Like this user.

13:19:06
<transcript>: We're going to say.

13:19:17
<transcript>: Get current user.

13:19:20
<transcript>: Current user.

13:19:23
reggie_dev: Would you say you're passionate about sports and sports data or more just a "job" for you?

13:19:23
<transcript>: On and I'm going to say.

13:19:29
<transcript>: Is it just going to stringify it? Will that work? Maybe.

13:19:32
<transcript>: That'll work.

13:19:35
<transcript>: Let's try it.

13:19:35
<transcript>: what's that

13:19:37
<transcript>: What's that do.

13:19:42
<transcript>: It's going to pass in.

13:19:50
<transcript>: Is it going to break? It did not break. Okay, so I wonder what it looks like. Let's see, what did it pass into user.

13:19:54
<transcript>: Avatar, user.

13:20:00
<transcript>: So it's undefined or something. It couldn't serialize it.

13:20:10
<transcript>: Reggie I used to be pretty passionate about sports. I think Stapmy's kind of burned me out if I'm being honest.

13:20:14
<transcript>: I think I kind of got burned out after five years at stat, muse.

13:20:14
<transcript>: so yeah

13:20:17
<transcript>: So yeah, not as into sports these days.

13:20:32
<transcript>: But I mean, I still love samus. It's still kind of like sometimes I get lost just searching a bunch of stuff, just like the first day when we first built it. My co founder and I really struggled to get stuff done because we just played with it so much. It was like, so fun to ask all these questions.

13:20:40
<transcript>: There wasn't really a way or a tool that you could do the kind of things you could with stabilize where you could just so quickly get answers to stuff.

13:20:40
<transcript>: so we just like

13:20:40
dnbull: im just happy the miami heat smacked the bucks last night :D

13:20:50
<transcript>: So we just, like, would get lost on it. And it'd be hard to build new features because we'd just be playing with it. I'm just happy the Miami Heat smacked Bucks last night. I can't believe the Heat beat the Bucks.

13:20:51
bodhihawken: Lol, im having to localise our currency stuff for Indonesia, our UI design was not built for 6 zeros XD

13:20:56
<transcript>: Okay.

13:20:59
<transcript>: So if you're not logged in.

13:21:03
dnbull: no one ever believes in the heat besides miami people LUL

13:21:05
<transcript>: It still passes user so that's not going to work. I got to somehow extract.

13:21:12
<transcript>: How can I safely.

13:21:12
<transcript>: i need

13:21:14
<transcript>: I need to safely.

13:21:17
<transcript>: Access.

13:21:22
<transcript>: Like the ID or something.

13:21:26
<transcript>: Let's do the ID.

13:21:26
<transcript>: this

13:21:26
trivenge: my friend suggests that the section 174 tax change this year asserting that all SWE's are R&E is a large part responsible for the massive layoffs due to larger incoming tax bills now and into the future unless fixed. anyone know much on this?

13:21:28
<transcript>: This isn't going to work.

13:21:30
<transcript>: If you're not logged in, is it.

13:21:32
<transcript>: Is it.

13:21:38
<transcript>: Does the front end have any awareness of a user? Does it know if you're logged in? That's the question.

13:21:39
smilingbig: catJAM

13:21:43
<transcript>: That's the question.

13:21:43
<transcript>: avat

13:21:46
<transcript>: Avatar user, okay, it didn't break.

13:21:46
<transcript>: now if

13:21:49
<transcript>: Now if I log in.

13:21:53
<transcript>: If I log in.

13:21:55
<transcript>: Sign up.

13:21:58
<transcript>: Or actually sign in.

13:22:06
<transcript>: Let's see here.

13:22:14
<transcript>: I log in.

13:22:14
<transcript>: does the user

13:22:16
<transcript>: Does the user.

13:22:21
<transcript>: What does it get? Pass? S is it passy ID.

13:22:29
<transcript>: Aha, wait. Url. What? Yeah. We're on the wrong page. Those points in a game. It'd be on this page.

13:22:34
<transcript>: So that's where it broke.

13:22:38
<transcript>: Okay.

13:22:38
<transcript>: mot

13:22:41
<transcript>: Mothra, fetch, username.

13:22:43
<transcript>: Fetch, what.

13:22:47
<transcript>: Sign in token. Created.

13:22:52
moussx_: @triveNge Did that tax change also trigger the -40% of tech valuation that happened over the last 12/15 months?

13:22:53
<transcript>: So it couldn't access.

13:22:54
<transcript>: Id.

13:23:01
<transcript>: Is there not an ID on it? Do I need to do like username? Maybe I'll do username.

13:23:04
<transcript>: Just try that just in case.

13:23:12
<transcript>: Or maybe I need to do dot notation. I don't know. Maybe map get. I don't know.

13:23:28
trivenge: besides manager hiring, and reducing costs, it could be a contributing factor at least

13:23:29
<transcript>: My friend suggests that the Section 174 tax change this year, asserting that all software engineers are rne is a large part responsible for the massive layoffs due to larger incoming tax bills now and into the future unless fixed. I don't know anything about that. That sounds bad. Is that why everybody got wrecked by taxes.

13:23:35
<transcript>: My Twitter timeline was full of people being like getting wrecked this year.

13:23:37
<transcript>: User fetch.

13:23:43
<transcript>: So why can't I do that.

13:23:45
<transcript>: Access.

13:23:52
<transcript>: Can I do.

13:23:55
darrenbaldwin03: I didnt get wrecked -- legit got 3k in tax returns this year lmao

13:23:55
<transcript>: Atom like that.

13:23:58
<transcript>: Do that.

13:24:07
<transcript>: Did that tax change also trigger the 40% of Tech valuation that happened over the last twelve to 15 months.

13:24:07
<transcript>: oh the minus

13:24:09
<transcript>: Oh, the -40%.

13:24:09
<transcript>: yeah

13:24:19
<transcript>: Yeah, that's the thing too. Besides manager hiring and reducing cost, it could be contributing factor. At least I didn't get wrecked. Legit got 3000 tax returns this year. Interesting, Darren. Yeah, I heard a lot of people the other way.

13:24:19
<transcript>: like got hamm

13:24:23
<transcript>: Like got hammered. I didn't get any. I don't think I got hammered.

13:24:29
<transcript>: I have a weird tax situation this year because of all the solar.

13:24:34
<transcript>: So why can't I why can't I access a property on it.

13:24:34
<transcript>: riddle

13:24:38
<transcript>: Riddle me this. Why can't I do that.

13:24:38
<transcript>: i do

13:24:40
<transcript>: I do this.

13:24:43
<transcript>: Can I do that.

13:24:47
<transcript>: The current user, username.

13:24:55
<transcript>: Come on.

13:24:55
<transcript>: oh this sucks

13:24:57
<transcript>: Oh, this sucks.

13:24:59
<transcript>: Doesn't look good on mobile.

13:24:59
<transcript>: and it's going to take

13:25:01
<transcript>: And it's going to take, like all day.

13:25:03
<transcript>: Oh, it worked.

13:25:03
<transcript>: what

13:25:10
<transcript>: What did I do? I did username, and it worked. Okay, inspect. Let's see what it looks like.

13:25:14
<transcript>: Yeah? User Adam. Perfect.

13:25:14
<transcript>: okay and then

13:25:17
<transcript>: Okay. And then if user is.

13:25:20
<transcript>: Undefined. Does it still work.

13:25:20
<transcript>: most

13:25:22
<transcript>: Most points in a game.

13:25:22
<transcript>: does this still work

13:25:23
<transcript>: Does this still work.

13:25:26
<transcript>: No. Now it doesn't work.

13:25:26
<transcript>: on no

13:25:29
<transcript>: On no user cool.

13:25:31
<transcript>: Exciting.

13:25:36
<transcript>: I at least know how to solve this.

13:25:36
<transcript>: it's with

13:25:39
<transcript>: It's with the big if block.

13:25:45
<transcript>: This is going to be so ugly. Just ignore how ugly this is.

13:25:45
<transcript>: and

13:25:46
<transcript>: And.

13:25:46
<transcript>: it has actual

13:25:51
<transcript>: It has actual runtime implications as well. Ignore it. It's not the most efficient.

13:25:51
<transcript>: it's not

13:25:53
<transcript>: It's not great, but.

13:25:53
<transcript>: this is what

13:25:58
<transcript>: This is what I'm doing, okay? This is what I'm doing, because I don't know how to set that to a variable.

13:26:02
<transcript>: Can I just say like equals user.

13:26:02
<transcript>: just

13:26:06
<transcript>: Just do that and then it's set to user.

13:26:11
<transcript>: Can I do that? Anybody know.

13:26:14
<transcript>: This one is going to have no user.

13:26:22
<transcript>: Just like that. I don't know if I can set that to user or not.

13:26:26
<transcript>: Do that. How could I say.

13:26:26
<transcript>: i want

13:26:28
<transcript>: I want to run git current user.

13:26:28
<transcript>: in this

13:26:30
<transcript>: In this template.

13:26:35
<transcript>: I want to run git current user that's fine.

13:26:35
<transcript>: it's fine

13:26:40
<transcript>: It's fine. I'm doing it twice. Whatever. I don't care.

13:26:40
<transcript>: doing it tw

13:26:43
<transcript>: Doing it twice. If it's not nil, do it again.

13:26:43
<transcript>: cool

13:26:44
<transcript>: Cool.

13:26:48
<transcript>: That should work in both cases.

13:26:51

fossabot: Statmuse uses Elixir because an early engineer particularly enjoyed it. It's a great language and an intro to functional programming so you should check it out https://elixir-lang.org/

13:28:44
mecoupz: there is an elixir code here that explains it

13:28:47
<transcript>: Classic skimmer tactic. It's too early to get this hard with the troll. Haven't even finished my copy yet. Exactly. Shaker, shaker. Welcome to Chat. Hi. What made you use elixir for a startup.

13:28:47
<transcript>: in two thousand and

13:28:55
<transcript>: In 2014. Don't want to distract you so you can answer in one or two sentences. Thanks. I think we even have an elixir command. We do. There you go.

13:28:55
<transcript>: there

13:29:00
<transcript>: There it is. Didn't even have to. Didn't even have to say words. Okay.

13:29:05
<transcript>: So I'm going to copy the avatar component, and we're going to make a new component.

13:29:08
<transcript>: That's just like the avatar component.

13:29:08
dmdboi: "An early engineer enjoyed it" and now we're subjected to it

13:29:11

13:29:31
nexxeln: sorry im not moderating im working peepoSad

13:29:39
<transcript>: But it's going to work. We're going to make it work for us again. This is a dying code base. We're literally getting rid of this code base. I'm rewriting it. I'm almost done rewriting it. This all feels.

13:29:39
<transcript>: very

13:29:43
<transcript>: Very okay if you'll find doing this.

13:29:44
<transcript>: Write menu.

13:29:48
<transcript>: Okay. So this is a right menu and.

13:29:48
<transcript>: this one

13:29:49
trivenge: no worries

13:29:49
twistedseed: touch typing I see

13:29:50
<transcript>: This one.

13:29:55
<transcript>: The engineer enjoyed it. Now we're subjected to it.

13:29:57
<transcript>: That's funny.

13:29:57
<transcript>: one something last

13:30:01
<transcript>: One something last night and have yet to win a MacBook these steps.

13:30:11
<transcript>: Touch typing. I see what's touched. Typing.

13:30:22
<transcript>: Is touch driving. This is the one that I'm always like, wait, there's actually a word for that. It's just typing, right? Like, just typing without looking.

13:30:24
<transcript>: That just typing.

13:30:27
<transcript>: Is it normal to look when you type.

13:30:27
<transcript>: i'm going to

13:30:34
<transcript>: I'm going to describe this to me, and I was very surprised that there's a name for it. I thought it was just that's like, you know, how to type.

13:30:35
warrenbuffering: YOU USE HOME ROW?!?

13:30:35
2dorkstv: I think it has to do with how hard you press the keys

13:30:38
<transcript>: And if you're a programmer and you type all day.

13:30:38
<transcript>: use

13:30:40
<transcript>: Use Homero.

13:30:44
<transcript>: Isn't that just the default assumption that we all know how to type.

13:30:51
dnbull: im saving up my points to meet 1on1 with adam :D  20k more to go

13:30:53
<transcript>: Are people teaching people they don't need to know how to type. I see this like I see people say, like, hey, as a programmer, you should learn how to type good. And people get all upset.

13:30:53
<transcript>: who's teaching

13:30:55
daglee: Touch typing is not looking and using all fingers.

13:30:56
<transcript>: Who's teaching people you don't need to know how to type.

13:30:56
<transcript>: that's all we do

13:30:57
laytanl_: You use fingers???

13:31:01
trivenge: what keyboard does dax use?

13:31:07
thdxr: a better one

13:31:08
<transcript>: That's all we do. It's literally the only physical manifestation of our work. Unless you count all the chemical stuff going on in our brain. It's like our keys being pressed by our fingers. That is what we do for a living. So of course, you should learn how to type.

13:31:10
warrenbuffering: Probably @theo

13:31:12
looch94: I thought touch typing meant using all fingers

13:31:16
<transcript>: Two dorks I think it has to do with how hard you press the keys? Oh, really? Saving up my points to meet one on one with Adam.

13:31:16
<transcript>: twenty thousand

13:31:23
<transcript>: 20,000 more. That's not too far. Looking forward to it. Dean Bull, you'll be the first touch. Typing is not looking and using all fingers.

13:31:23
<transcript>: you use

13:31:24
trivenge: is it one of those logitech ones? @thdxr

13:31:26
<transcript>: You use fingers.

type_typescript: hello my friend. it's not too late to rewrite this in typescript

13:31:30
<transcript>: Keyword is actually is a better one that's funny.

13:31:30
<transcript>: so i touch typ

13:31:32
<transcript>: So I touch typing that loot using all fingers.

13:31:34
thdxr: mxkeys

13:31:37
<transcript>: Wait. Of course. Yeah. What other fingers? Why would I not use all my fingers.

13:31:37
<transcript>: is it

13:31:47
<transcript>: Is it one of those Logitech ones? Welcome to chat type typescript. Hello, my friend. It's not too late to rewrite this in typescript. We are rewriting it in typescript. Actually.

13:31:47
<transcript>: we're rewriting

13:31:49
<transcript>: We're? Rewriting an Astro.

13:31:54
<transcript>: Or you mean like these specific components, these javascript components because I'm not rereading those.

13:31:54
<transcript>: i'm not

13:31:59
thdxr: a lot of dummies are replying to my thread help

13:32:00
<transcript>: I'm not rewriting these because this code base is dead. We're not maintaining it. It's being replaced.

13:32:00
<transcript>: okay

13:32:01
laytanl_: JavaScript NotLikeThis NotLikeThis

13:32:01
2dorkstv: You'd be surprised how many folks don't use all their fingers. I've met devs that hit backspace with their index finger 0_o

13:32:04
trivenge: do you like mxkeys because you enjoy laptop keys?

13:32:07
<transcript>: Okay. Menu button. So here's what we need to do on this one. There's going to be a prop. It's going to be called user.

13:32:08
type_typescript: i actually meant the whole app

13:32:09
looch94: I don’t use my pinkie when I type

13:32:15
<transcript>: A lot of dummies were applying to my thread help. Oh, yeah. Can you paste your thread in here? And we'll do Twitter time. I got to eat my alarm. Hungry.

13:32:17
kenrick_codes: why replace?

13:32:23
adamdotdev: !rewrite

13:32:24
<transcript>: Ken Rick, Why replace? Did I do? Did I do a command for this.

13:32:28
<transcript>: We get this question a lot, too. It's kind of a long story.

13:32:28
<transcript>: but

13:32:34
trivenge: i dont use my pinky, which is a scam

13:32:40
<transcript>: But we started this code base, like, seven years ago, and it's just time to start over. No one really has familiarity with elixir in the in the company, like, we do it. We do what we have to, but we're not really elixir Dev.

13:32:48
laytanl_: @thdxr I got so many replies to my tweet about auth, touchy subject

13:32:50
<transcript>: So we're rewriting it in astro. It's also just like the perfect fit for astro. We could have built it in php. That'd also be a perfect fit. It's like thousands, millions of pages, even.

13:32:50
<transcript>: but not a lot

13:32:54
<transcript>: But not a lot of interactivity, not a lot of client side interactivity.

13:32:55
trivenge: except pinky is used for like shift and so forth

13:32:57
<transcript>: Don't use my pinky, which is a scam.

13:33:09
<transcript>: Off of the touch subject. Somebody link dax's thing. Actually, I have to pee. I have to pee. I have to eat my lara bar. We got to talk about some tweets. There's just so much to do.

13:33:09
<transcript>: and i

13:33:12
<transcript>: And I actually have a lot of work to do as well.

13:33:12

13:40:17

13:40:17
<transcript>: like

13:40:24
<transcript>: Like it's not really for spas that's like next year's remix are better for client side reactivity stuff.

13:44:19
archieedwds: nice! dmd you worked at baselime for a bit right?

13:44:20
tnkhanh: diamond where are you?

13:44:25
<transcript>: As with the usual a bunch of you missing the point in your eagerness to have a smart reply to clarify the main point here is auth as a service business.

13:44:25
<transcript>: as a

13:44:36
<transcript>: As a service, businesses want to do three for you. And you should think twice. As I said in the thread offloading, one plus two, many flavors is totally fine. Yeah, totally agree with your whole thread. Dax.

13:44:37
schrew: Did the city arsenal game make the app pop off? @dmdboi

13:44:37
<transcript>: Totally agree.

13:44:37
<transcript>: with

13:44:39
tnkhanh: clap!

13:44:39
<transcript>: With all of it.

13:44:39

sockthedev: https://images.brickset.com/sets/large/516-1.jpg?201004050411 Adam building statmuse

13:44:42
<transcript>: And I am not surprised that people would be.

13:44:42
dmdboi: over 500 downloads, 300+ users, and I emailed the local transport department to see if they want to work together to improve their app

13:44:54
<transcript>: Taking it wrong and all that serverless is an architecture. Treat it like one. It's not a way of life. If your app doesn't work in serverless, don't use it. Stop making it work by spending hundreds of dollars every month.

13:44:54
<transcript>: next

13:44:54
smilingbig: I believe everything dax says

13:44:58
<transcript>: Next I love you so much. You're so good at Twitter and.

13:45:00
<transcript>: You think? Good.

13:45:00
<transcript>: you think

13:45:01
thdxr: nex i don’t like you again

13:45:04
goodgrandpaa: @dmdboi Dude, that's sick! Congrats! :)

13:45:07
<transcript>: You think? Good. Exactly. I'm running my two simple T three apps on digitalocean $5 for an F, $15 for a db, it works perfectly.

13:45:08
nexxeln: LUL @thdxr

13:45:09
dmdboi: @Schrew I have an internal dashboard and see when games are on cause more users are getting to the stadiums

13:45:10
thdxr: serverless is a way of life

13:45:10
<transcript>: Dex doesn't like you again.

13:45:10
<transcript>: it's funny

13:45:12
<transcript>: It's funny.

13:45:16
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm trying to think DAX.

13:45:16
<transcript>: what architect

13:45:19
mecoupz: nex is getting adam's next best friend?

13:45:19
<transcript>: What architectures? Don't work with serverless.

13:45:23
<transcript>: Is it just like once you get certain scale it's unproven.

13:45:27
<transcript>: In terms of like cost effectiveness.

13:45:27
<transcript>: i don't know

13:45:29
dmdboi: @archieedwds Yup, 6 month skit there

13:45:30
mecoupz: dax is out of the game soon

13:45:34
<transcript>: I don't know there's no right answer it's all so dependent on your team and their skill sets and all of those things.

13:45:34
<transcript>: unit

13:45:36
thdxr: no nex doesn’t know what he’s talking about

13:45:39
thdxr: ignore this tweet

13:45:41
dmdboi: @tnkhanh Manchester, UK not Manchester, Alabama

13:45:43
<transcript>: Unit economics. I don't know. Stuff like that. Total cost of ownership. Why does everyone suddenly use a sas for their auth? Look at Layton, Layton.

13:45:43
<transcript>: you

13:45:49
smilingbig: we're full serverless at my work

13:45:52
<transcript>: You knew? And then dax came out and had that banger thread. No. Next doesn't know what he's talking about, nor the tweet. I love it. Dex is out of the game soon.

13:45:59
<transcript>: Next is getting adam's next best friend. Next is getting adam's next best friend.

13:45:59
<transcript>: next

13:46:08
<transcript>: Next is my current best friend. What do you mean? I don't know if it's mutual. I don't know if he thinks I'm his best friend. But next is my best friend, Manchester, UK, not Manchester, Alabama.

13:46:15
tnkhanh: woohoo, nice

13:46:15
<transcript>: We're full servos at my work that's rare that people get to work full serverless at work.

13:46:15
<transcript>: feels

13:46:17
<transcript>: Feels like still way too rare.

13:46:17
thdxr: oh great adam and nex podcast incoming

13:46:20
<transcript>: Oh, man, there's such a good story about.

13:46:20
<transcript>: some of the origin

13:46:25
<transcript>: Some of the origins of serverless and I can't wait to share it in some form.

13:46:27
thdxr: warning adam will use you and toss you aside

13:46:27
bodhihawken: Scale isn't the problem! But there certainly are cases where serverless doesn't yet cover it! but yes were also fully serverless!

13:46:30
<transcript>: Adam and Next podcasting. Coming.

13:46:31
sockthedev: god, i envy you smilingbig

13:46:33
nexxeln: best friends pepeJAM

13:46:38
<transcript>: You know, dax, I will say warning. Adam will use you and toss you aside. Whatever next, I will say I literally had the thought.

13:46:38
<transcript>: max like

13:46:40
sockthedev: i work in an azure environment by day

13:46:46
sockthedev: 🤮

13:46:51
smilingbig: apparently we're one of the biggest aws serverless users in eu

13:46:57
<transcript>: Max like, oh, nex is smart. Like, Max like, nax you're on the podcast with me. And I just defer to you on everything in the podcast because you're smart and you have good thoughts. I don't have those good thoughts. So I just get to ask you questions. And I had the thought next could serve that role too. We'll start another podcast. We'll call it yesterday.

13:46:58
aj_stuyvenberg: bluesky time eh?

13:47:00
<transcript>: Tomorrow, and yesterday.

13:47:00
<transcript>: okay

13:47:01
rickrickyy: Good morning guys(

13:47:01
<transcript>: Okay.

13:47:04
sockthedev: azure + cray cray terraform

13:47:06
amazingdavi: LUL

13:47:09
<transcript>: Blue sky time. I don't think we're doing blue sky time.

13:47:09
<transcript>: it's not that much on

13:47:12
<transcript>: It's not that much on blue skies. There.

13:47:12
<transcript>: let's see

13:47:17
<transcript>: Let's see. Scale isn't the problem, but there certainly are cases where serverless doesn't yet cover it.

13:47:17
<transcript>: but

13:47:18
aj_stuyvenberg: looooool

13:47:20
<transcript>: But yes, we're also fully serverless.

13:47:35
<transcript>: Yeah. Is it happening? Are people adopting it wholesale and becoming fully serverless? Seemed like it was so slow to catch on. I work in an Azure environment by day. Ew sock. I'm so sorry. I don't know. I don't really use Azure.

13:47:42
<transcript>: Apparently, we're one of the biggest aws service users in U. What company is it? Smiling.

13:47:42
<transcript>: good

13:47:44
thdxr: dw we fixed it people are doing serverless now

13:47:44
<transcript>: Good Morning, Rick. Ricky.

13:47:46
naxodev: I'm full Cloudflare

13:47:51
<transcript>: Also Good morning aj. Don't worry, we fixed it people are doing serverless now nice.

13:47:55
smilingbig: I'd prefer not to say KEKW

13:47:55
aj_stuyvenberg: MORNING

13:47:57
<transcript>: Full Cloudflare knacks though I have a thought on Twitter since we're on Twitter time right now.

13:48:02
<transcript>: I posted a thing on Twitter.

13:48:02
<transcript>: and got a

13:48:06
<transcript>: And got a quote, Tweet that was mean. And I realized.

13:48:12
<transcript>: You can't really be mean to me on the internet or like you can.

13:48:21
<transcript>: I really don't care. And I don't mean that in, like, a like, I'm bigger than you. So I don't care that you said something negative. I mean, like, literally. I don't have emotions.

13:48:24
<transcript>: So like it's hard to pick on me.

13:48:24
<transcript>: and when

13:48:32
sockthedev: that guy was being a bit of a douche

13:48:33
jokestera_e: You really shouldn't care you're allowed to brag about your accomplishments

13:48:35
<transcript>: And when this person said this mean thing in a quote, Tweet, it wasn't even a mean thing. He's probably right. He said that I was just. What did he say? It was cringe. Everything I do is probably cringe. And that's fine.

13:48:37
thdxr: no it’s pretty easy to pick on you

13:48:38
sockthedev: no he wasn't

13:48:44
mattmancodes: Was it Dax?

13:48:47
<transcript>: It really doesn't affect me, though, like in a negative, emotional way. And I got to leverage that somehow I got to turn that into an advantage on the internet. You can't hurt me.

13:48:47
<transcript>: you're just like

13:48:48
smilingbig: fuck that dude

13:48:50
<transcript>: You're just like I'm unheard of on the internet.

13:48:55
<transcript>: How do I leverage that? How do I turn that into good, something for good.

13:48:58
samhuckaby: If you aren't cringe once in awhile, you aren't using Twitter to its fullest

13:48:59
warrenbuffering: dunk back

13:49:01
kevinnaughtonjr: not being affected by ppl's feelings means you can make infinite content

13:49:09
<transcript>: Let's see, it's pretty easy to pick on you. Yeah. I mean, it's easy to pick on me. It just doesn't actually affect me. You know what I mean? My emotional state just doesn't affect my emotional state. So, like, dunk back now I'm just doing what dax says.

13:49:11
teej_dv: oh you're unhurtable? i think your cameras suck

13:49:14
<transcript>: He just says, yes, when people are like, You're such a jerk.

13:49:14
<transcript>: you just reply

13:49:15
warrenbuffering: dunk back and never acknowledge

13:49:15
naxodev: Tell them, I love you

13:49:17
dmdboi: This song comes on at least once per stream

13:49:18
<transcript>: You just reply yes, and that just gets to him more.

13:49:21
<transcript>: I don't want to be a jerk back.

13:49:21
<transcript>: but

13:49:22
tnkhanh: it just hasnt yet

13:49:28
smilingbig: teej_dv too far KEKW

13:49:28
<transcript>: But I got to figure out how to. I don't know how to leverage it. Let's see. Was it DAX? Yeah, it was DAX.

13:49:28
<transcript>: you really

13:49:28
theaveragegoob: Yeah narcissists aren't affected by what other people say. Kind of a superpower LUL

13:49:29
tobs_on_twitch: @teej_dv oh no you didnttttt

13:49:30
lesabotsy: Can't be worse than a scammer

13:49:30
warrenbuffering: smart

13:49:32
mecoupz: "i don't have feelings" -- dont say that to your wife LUL

13:49:35
<transcript>: You really shouldn't care. You're allowed to brag about your accomplishments. Yeah, that's what it was. I mean, I. Tweeted. About how much I made him up. Here's. The thing.

13:49:40
tnkhanh: if 1000 mean messages come in, you will notice the weight monkaS

13:49:41
<transcript>: So I had a very unique situation. The last couple of weeks, where I got paid a lot of money to do something.

13:49:41
<transcript>: and

13:49:44
<transcript>: And I could just not tell anybody.

13:49:44
<transcript>: and just

13:49:46
<transcript>: And just keep that to myself.

13:49:46
<transcript>: or

13:49:51
<transcript>: Or I'm coming over here. This is actually something important. It's important.

13:49:54
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat every.

13:49:54
<transcript>: goob

13:49:56
amazingdavi: @teej_dv LUL

13:49:58
night_light90: I always view twitter as a not real place , I never used it.

13:50:00
<transcript>: Goob narcissist aren't affected by what other people say kind of super. No. Am I a narcissist? I thought I was.

13:50:00
<transcript>: just

13:50:00
theaveragegoob: Whattup bro :)

13:50:01
<transcript>: Just.

13:50:01
<transcript>: i had no

13:50:05
sockthedev: i think it's impossible for adam to be a jerk. even when he throws out a soft tease, he'll almost always follow up with a reply saying he was joking

13:50:05
<transcript>: I had no emotional depth or something, but it could be the narcissist thing, I guess.

13:50:10
kevinnaughtonjr: no matter what kind of content you make someone will always be mad/upset. as long as you know that your intentions are good that's all that matters

13:50:12
<transcript>: You're unheard of I think your cameras suck. It's okay, Teach. I get an self worth out of my cameras.

13:50:13
<transcript>: Okay.

13:50:13
<transcript>: so i'm trying

13:50:20
<transcript>: So I'm trying to think, is there anything anybody could say? We were talking about this the other day. My wife and I I don't think I've ever been offended in my life.

13:50:20
<transcript>: i just don't even

13:50:23
theaveragegoob: We need more people who don't respond emotionally to everything

13:50:23
<transcript>: I just don't even know what offended feels like.

13:50:23
<transcript>: not

13:50:39
<transcript>: Not being affected by people's feelings mean you can make infinite content. Oh, okay. So I'm more resilient to that stuff. Okay. If you aren't cringe once in a while, you aren't using Twitter to its fullest. Okay. So I want to talk about what I said and the realities of why I? Tweet what I tweet.

13:50:42
<transcript>: So made a lot of money.

13:50:42
<transcript>: is a very unique novel

13:50:45
<transcript>: Is a very unique novel situation where I know.

13:50:45
<transcript>: there's people

13:50:57
<transcript>: There's people out there who just don't understand that this kind of stuff is possible that you can make unlimited money in tech especially if you work for yourself. Average group thank you so much for that. Follow.

13:50:57
<transcript>: so

13:51:02
<transcript>: So there's people that just don't even know it's possible for one for two. It's.

13:51:02
<transcript>: like

13:51:05
<transcript>: Like by not sharing it.

13:51:05
<transcript>: what do i

13:51:08
<transcript>: What do I gain by not sharing it.

13:51:17
<transcript>: It just kind of like personally, financially I'm impacted and that's great. But that's not even that important to me. My wife. It's important to but ultimately.

13:51:19
<transcript>: My neighbor.

13:51:19
<transcript>: ben

13:51:27
techsavvytravvy: i made a cringe tweet from the cringe tweet of your cringe tweet

13:51:33
<transcript>: Ben. He left his job and he now works for himself. He does exactly what I was doing before I rejoined Stapmus. He's an aws consultant, independent. He's making more money he's ever made in his life. And he's super happy with it with that situation.

13:51:37
<transcript>: Like his best month just had his best month.

13:51:37
<transcript>: he's two doors

13:51:39
jokestera_e: You left statmuse?

13:51:40
bodhihawken: yeah just started signing a 200k contract for a 4 month build with serverless, anything is possible tech!

13:51:42
mhuggins7278: Tell me your a psychopath without telling me your a psychopath

13:51:45
goodgrandpaa: @jokesterA_E Previously, yeah.

13:51:51
goodgrandpaa: @jokesterA_E He's back though

13:51:54
<transcript>: He's two doors down for me. And the reason he left the job and did on stuff is because I was doing all this stuff and talking about it. So I'm going to keep talking about it. And there are people who are inherently going to be bothered by it. And I don't know what to do with that because I don't want to just offend people or I don't know if offend is the right word. I don't want to ruffle everyone's feathers.

13:52:03
<transcript>: But I know it can be off putting when you see other people talk about successes. I don't know how to deliver it in a way that gets the benefit without the drawback. Does that make sense.

13:52:03
<transcript>: is there

13:52:04
thdxr: there’s this repressed culture that exists here where you cannot talk about success to the point where it’s false humility

13:52:06
<transcript>: Is there a way to package it.

13:52:06
<transcript>: that helps

13:52:09
thdxr: it’s not like that globally

13:52:17
thdxr: miami is not like that at all

13:52:18
<transcript>: That helps inspire people to quit their jobs, to do whatever. I don't want to just send people off into the wilderness. Quitting their jobs all. Willynilly, that's not my goal, nerdigi. Thank you so much. I follow.

13:52:18
<transcript>: that's

13:52:23
aj_stuyvenberg: dax: international flex sensation

13:52:25
teej_dv: miami is not like anywhere else, from what i hear

13:52:25
smilingbig: I'm quitting right now

13:52:37
thdxr: but tech world is all like “i’m rich and it’s a secret shhhh”

13:52:38
<transcript>: That's not my goal. But I know that it's positively impacted people. They've been inspired. How do I do that without the negative? Because I don't care if this guy said this thing. He said it really doesn't emotionally, in any way alter my state of being. But I just don't like that. I created that in someone that I created this feeling in them that they felt like they needed to kind of like, lash out.

13:52:38
<transcript>: not

13:52:43
thdxr: imo that’s even more pretentious

13:52:51
archieedwds: the way to do it is to be known for sharing the downsides too. its pretty similar to businesses sharing MRR charts

13:52:52
<transcript>: Not even lash out, just like, call it out. So how do you package it? There's this repressed culture that exists where you cannot talk about success to the point where it's false humility. It's not like that globally. Miami is not like that at all.

13:52:57
<transcript>: But tech world is all like, I'm rich, and it's a secret shh.

13:52:57
<transcript>: even more

13:53:00
theaveragegoob: @thdxr preach it dude - so true

13:53:04
<transcript>: Even more petition. So here's the thing. I feel like the more people in Tech talk about how much money they make, the better. What is the downside.

13:53:06
<transcript>: There is no downside.

13:53:06
<transcript>: i mean i guess

13:53:09
mhuggins7278: @adamdotdev not sure you can. Some people just suck

13:53:09
<transcript>: I mean, I guess the feeling that people have that.

13:53:12
<transcript>: They're not getting that.

13:53:18
kevinnaughtonjr: i think packaging things using "i" is helpful instead of "you/you should".  talking about your own experiences with what worked for you and what you learned vs what ppl "should" do helps as well

13:53:22
<transcript>: But is it worth it if some people are made aware of this reality, that you make a lot of money in tech. And now I want to go do this. I want to pursue it because I know there's a reason to.

13:53:22
<transcript>: mcne

13:53:24
<transcript>: Mcneiland.

13:53:24
<transcript>: thank

13:53:28
<transcript>: Thank you for that follow. Climbing dev. Do I see that one? Thank you for the follow as well.

13:53:30
night_light90: it's twitter its not a real place , and that person would not say what he said to your face

13:53:35
<transcript>: Okay. Let me go back and read some chat. You left sammy's? Yeah. I was fired back in 2019.

13:53:35
<transcript>: and then

13:53:38
<transcript>: And then I rejoined in the last six months.

13:53:38
<transcript>: i made

13:53:45
theaveragegoob: I heard about some dude who flipped his shit and blamed his wife for a tubi commercial "interrupting" the super bow. - she is divorcing him over that blow up. Sometimes people just aren't emotionally stable

13:53:46
<transcript>: I made a cringe tweet from the cringe tweet of your Quinn cringe tweet. Oh, no, trav, just now, you made a cringe tweet.

13:53:46
<transcript>: we need more

13:53:46
smilingbig: I feel bad when I make more money than other people KEKW I prefer not knowing

13:53:52
thdxr: i love miami because you’ll see some dude who doesn’t look like he’ll be successful and they’ll tell you all about why they’re crazy rich and it’s inspiring

13:54:01
goodgrandpaa: Another downside is that when you tell someone that you can make a lot of money, but not provide a potential roadmap is kind of half motivational. Hard to see ourselves in your position or the position of someone that makes a ton of money, if we can't see a roadmap for ourselves.

13:54:06
<transcript>: We need more people who don't respond emotionally to everything. No matter what kind of content you make, someone will always be mad upset. As long as you know that your intentions are good. That's all that matters. So, Kevin, I don't know if my intentions are good. This is another thing. I just had Jason Langstorf on the stream the other day because I want to just pick his brain about like he's somebody who I look at in tech. Learn with Jason if you're not.

13:54:06
<transcript>: familiar

13:54:06
mattmancodes: DON'T SPOIL IT! I'm quite happy making a lot of money typing nonsense words that power websites that don't matter.

13:54:07
dnbull: yeah i agree w/ @night_light90 twitter is such a bubble... super false reality of life to be honest... Most of the world doesn't know about AI like we do LUL

13:54:23
<transcript>: Familiar. He's somebody that I look at. And I think he seems to have really good intentions. And one of the questions I asked him was like, do you have any bad intentions? Because from the surface, you look very good intentioned. But one thing I constantly struggle with is, what are my intentions? Half the time I feel like, I don't even know.

13:54:30
<transcript>: I want to say I'm in a stage in my career where my intentions are pure and that I want to help other people.

13:54:30
<transcript>: but

13:54:31
lesabotsy: As long as I can get my macbook one day I don't care hahah

13:54:37
<transcript>: But I know there's so many selfish reasons I want to do every single thing I do so I don't always know what my intentions are.

13:54:37
<transcript>: and

13:54:43
warrenbuffering: good/bad intentions are subjective

13:54:43
<transcript>: And it's really hard for me sometimes to figure out on the scales. How does it all balance out.

13:54:48
fragaverage: I watch you in 480p to make myself feel better

13:54:52
<transcript>: I think there are altruistic intentions. There there's stuff where it's like I don't need or want anything else in life.

13:54:52
<transcript>: and

13:54:57
mattmancodes: haha

13:54:58
<transcript>: And it feels like it would be fulfilling to help other people. It is fulfilling, like when I see other people that have had.

13:54:58
<transcript>: some

13:55:00
thdxr: @teej_dv come visit

13:55:05
<transcript>: Some inspiration from something I did. And they moved to some new stage of life that they're loving. That is it feels great.

13:55:05
<transcript>: i'm not going to lie

13:55:15
theaveragegoob: I love helping people - it's a huge boost for both people <3

13:55:15
goodgrandpaa: @kevinnaughtonjr Super side note, thanks for thedailybyte!

13:55:19
<transcript>: I'm not going to lie and say that that's the only thing I get fulfillment from now is like seeing other people succeed because it's not. I also just get fulfillment from doing what I love, which is writing code and being on here with you guys. I mean.

13:55:19
<transcript>: there's so many

13:55:20
teej_dv: I liked miami when i went there on vacation awhile ago @thdxr i'll let you know if i come back

13:55:29
kevinnaughtonjr: np hope you're enjoying it @GoodGrandPaa !

13:55:30
<transcript>: There's so many millions of little nuances with intentions that I just don't know how to suss it all out. Okay, I'm talking too much. I'm not reading. I don't have feelings. They'll say it to your wife. Oh, my wife's. Well aware of me, coops.

13:55:33
<transcript>: My wife is the one that pointed out, I don't have feelings.

13:55:39
<transcript>: Tell them I love you dunk back and never acknowledge. Okay.

13:55:39
<transcript>: let's

13:55:40
goodgrandpaa: @kevinnaughtonjr I am! :) I love the emails to start the day :)

13:55:41
<transcript>: Let's keep scrolling.

13:55:41
<transcript>: can't be

13:55:44
<transcript>: Can't be worse than a scammer.

13:55:52
kevinnaughtonjr: i don't think it's bad if you have multiple intentions and some of them are for you and others are to help others :)

13:55:52
<transcript>: If 1000 mean messages come in you'll notice you will notice the weight. Maybe I'm just not the scale where.

13:55:52
<transcript>: the

13:55:55
thdxr: it’s ok his wife doesn’t have feelings for him

13:55:57
<transcript>: The backlash I get online has affected me negatively.

13:55:57
<transcript>: i literally can't think of a

13:56:06
<transcript>: I literally can't think of a time I've ever in my life been offended. And I feel like that's the reason I think it's something about my brain chemistry that maybe I don't.

13:56:06
<transcript>: have

13:56:08
mattmancodes: haha

13:56:10
<transcript>: Have I'm not offendable. I think that's possible. I think some people can't be offended.

13:56:10
<transcript>: and i think

13:56:10
lesabotsy: More seriously, may I DM you @adamdotdev ?

13:56:26
<transcript>: And I think it has to do with how little I value relationship. I'm going to say that that came out of my lips. My wife's heard it. She knows I am not someone, and she's kind of the same. I don't value relationship that much interpersonal stuff doesn't do it for me. So much.

13:56:26
<transcript>: i have friends

13:56:30
goodgrandpaa: I relate to that.

13:56:31
<transcript>: I have friends and I enjoy being with friends. And I enjoy talking with friends.

13:56:31
<transcript>: but

13:56:35
<transcript>: But at the end of the day, if you told me I was going to be the last person on Earth.

13:56:35
<transcript>: and i'd have

13:56:38
techsavvytravvy: WOW

13:56:40
<transcript>: And I'd have to live the rest of my life alone. I mean, I'd be sad.

13:56:43
techsavvytravvy: noted

13:56:46
<transcript>: If it meant like I don't get to see my kids again, my wife, I would be sad. But at the same time.

13:56:47
mhuggins7278: @adamdotdev  signs of a psychopath :)

13:56:52
<transcript>: I just don't put a lot of emphasis on it. And I think that's probably something in my brain. I don't know.

13:56:57
<transcript>: I always view Twitter as not a real place, as a not real place. I never used it.

13:56:57
<transcript>: twitter

13:56:58
<transcript>: Twitter. It's. It's a.

13:56:58
<transcript>: don't you

13:57:04
goodgrandpaa: @mhuggins7278 Not always a bad thing.

13:57:11
teej_dv: ok, confirmed. adam "getting a lot of money working for himself" is being a hitman.

13:57:13
<transcript>: Don't. You don't have to use it. Don't feel like you need to get on there. If you're not, maybe you're better off nerdy. Chase. Thank you for the follow. I don't know if I saw that one. I think it's impossible for Adam to be a jerk. Even when he throws out a soft tea. He'll almost always follow up with the reply, saying he was joking. I mean.

13:57:13
<transcript>: i think it's

13:57:13
warrenbuffering: anything against the status quo probably gonna be perceived as bad intentions. Change bad

13:57:19
<transcript>: I think it's all the things I just said. I think I just don't put a lot of emphasis or I'm not affected by interpersonal things.

13:57:19
<transcript>: in the way

13:57:22
<transcript>: In the way that most normal people are.

13:57:31
<transcript>: Neurotypical people you might say no matter what kind of who we are about that we need more people who don't respond already. Read that. I'm so behind. Okay.

13:57:31
<transcript>: just

13:57:34
dnbull: i'm upset no one made an ozark joke when adam said he made tons of money LUL

13:57:38
papagebu: @teej_dv i mean, the guy live in OZARK

13:57:42
<transcript>: Just started signing a $200,000 contract for a four month build with serverless. Anything is possible in tech. It's so true, bodie, we just got to keep talking about it. Keep sharing those things. I think it's a net positive.

<transcript>: m huggins

13:57:50
goodgrandpaa: @mhuggins7278 Many successful politicians/business leaders are. Not all are killers haha

13:57:55
<transcript>: M Huggins am I a psychopath? That sounds so much more negative. Maybe that's what it is. Am I a narcissist? A psychopath? Someone tell me.

13:57:55
<transcript>: let's see

13:57:57
<transcript>: Let's see dax international.

13:57:57
<transcript>: flex

13:58:03
<transcript>: Flex sensation. Miami is not like anywhere else. From what I hear, quitting right now. Do it. Smiling.

13:58:03
<transcript>: the way to do it

13:58:07
<transcript>: The way to do it is to be known? I'm trying to catch up? I'm trying.

13:58:07
<transcript>: it's the

13:58:11
<transcript>: It's. The problem is I read a message and I go off on some huge tangent, and then I just get way more behind.

13:58:21
<transcript>: Oh, I'm way behind? Way behind? I heard about some dude who flipped his Wait, it's Twitter. Oh, man, am I this behind.

13:58:21
<transcript>: m

13:58:29
<transcript>: M huggins. Welcome to you're. Not you're not new to chat. Never mind. Not sure you can. Some people just suck the way to do it.

13:58:29
<transcript>: is

13:58:37
<transcript>: Is to be known for sharing the downsides, too. It's pretty similar to business sharing mrr. Charts. Okay, archie, that's a good point.

13:58:37
<transcript>: i'll be honest

13:58:37
theaveragegoob: I found that so many people stopped talking to me when I started talking about my success :( I wonder why though...maybe it sounded like bragging.

13:58:48
smilingbig: you're maybe just a bit on the spectrum, not a psychopath KEKW

13:58:55
zoro1800: i have a great motivation to build something but i really dont know what to build. any advice?

13:58:56
dmdboi: Adam living in an ivory tower

13:58:57
<transcript>: I'll be honest. The last six months to a year, I don't think there's been any downsides to my life, but we've discussed this on Stream. I think my life is like peaking. I've hit peak life, and I know it's not going to last. I know it's a season, and I know we're going to look back at this time and say, wow, things were good, but legitimately things are like if I shared all the positives right now, I would.

13:58:57
<transcript>: look like

13:58:58
mhuggins7278: @GoodGrandPaa Yeah I know I'm joking....I'm actually similar to Adam in this matter.  At least when it comes to people I'm not close to

13:58:59
dmdboi: In the Ozarks

13:59:00
<transcript>: Look like a jerk on the internet because.

13:59:05
<transcript>: It would seem very like fake, but it really is just like Peak life.

13:59:08
mr_yan19: Good morning everyone

13:59:17
<transcript>: I don't have any negatives. I'm not lost anybody close to me. I've not had any serious hiccups with anything. I mean, three years ago I got fired from sad news. My own. Like that was my baby.

13:59:17
<transcript>: and that was

13:59:19
<transcript>: And that was a very tough time.

13:59:19
goodgrandpaa: @mhuggins7278 Oh okay! Just saw a few messages and thought I might say something :) No worries! Thanks for clearing it up!

13:59:21
smilingbig: but I have collected several mental health things so I'm probably not the best to judge KEKW

13:59:22
<transcript>: I haven't really had anything like that since.

13:59:33
techsavvytravvy: wait what

13:59:36
<transcript>: I think packaging things using I is helpful. Instead of you. You should talking about your own experiences with what worked for you and what you learn versus what people should do helps as well. Yeah. I don't have.

13:59:36
<transcript>: any

13:59:40
tayloreddev: I got fired once, turned out to be best thing to happen

13:59:42
<transcript>: Any feelings that I know what other people should do. And I am very careful sharing stuff.

13:59:42
<transcript>: because

13:59:43
<transcript>: Because.

13:59:43
<transcript>: i feel like

13:59:51
<transcript>: I feel like there's so much context. There's no formula. I don't feel like there's much for my career. I can be like, here's what I did. And that led to this. It just feels so random.

14:00:04
<transcript>: And a lot of it. You're in the right place, right time. I mean, I worked really hard. I said something like this the other day, and my wife got on me because I was like, she heard me say something about how it's all just luck. My career was just a big lucky break.

14:00:04
<transcript>: and she

14:00:10
<transcript>: And she talked about how if it was so much luck, why did I spend the first three years of our marriage working so hard.

14:00:10
<transcript>: she

14:00:17
<transcript>: She felt like she sacrificed something. And that was kind of discounting that I worked really hard at the beginning of my career. And I did.

14:00:17
<transcript>: so it's not

14:00:26
<transcript>: So it's not all luck. You got to work hard. I think some people probably don't. Some people. They just go lucky. I'm not getting ahead. I'm not catching up on chat. I'm just way behind.

14:00:47
<transcript>: I heard about some dude who flipped his shit and blames his wife for a tobe commercial interrupting the Super Bowl. What? She's divorcing him over that blow up. Sometimes people just aren't emotionally stable. I think I'm stable. I think there's pros and cons, but I do think I'm very emotionally stable. The Con is I don't really have much emotional depth.

14:00:48
<transcript>: So.

14:00:48
<transcript>: i don't ris

14:00:51
<transcript>: I don't rise to occasions But I also don't fall.

14:00:51
<transcript>: i don't

14:00:58
<transcript>: I don't know. I feel bad when I make more money than other people for not knowing. Yeah, there's that too.

14:00:58
<transcript>: societally

14:01:02
<transcript>: Societally. I don't know what to do. It's the fact that we make so much money in tech.

14:01:02
<transcript>: especially

14:01:03
theaveragegoob: No no no, that was part of the conversation about people getting mad at your content or reacting (haha, that was an old. comment) :3

14:01:04
<transcript>: Especially in the us.

14:01:04
<transcript>: and

14:01:24
<transcript>: And then other people do way harder jobs and they don't get as much money. I don't really know how it all works or what the solution is. I love my because you'll see some dude who doesn't look like he'll be successful and they'll tell you about why they're crazy rich. And it's inspiring. Another downside is that when you tell someone that you can make a lot of money but not provide a potential roadmap, it's kind of half motivational, hard to see ourselves.

14:01:24
<transcript>: in your position or

14:01:38
<transcript>: In your position or the position of someone that makes a ton of money. If we can't see a roadmap for ourselves, I got to read that again. Another downside is that when you tell someone you can make a lot of money but not provide potential roadmap. Oh, I see. Yeah, hard to hear see ourselves in a position.

14:01:38
<transcript>: yeah this

14:01:42
<transcript>: Yeah, this goes back to I don't really feel like there is a roadmap.

14:01:57
<transcript>: The best I've been able to do is inspire people to think about going independent because there is a cap. When you work for somebody else, there's only so much you can make, and eventually you're just making a lot more value for them than for yourself. And you just have to go out on your own. That's the best I can do.

14:01:57
<transcript>: i feel like

14:02:05
<transcript>: I feel like everything else is so specific to your context. I have had one on one conversations with people where I can be more specific because I know more about their situation.

14:02:05
<transcript>: okay

14:02:15
<transcript>: Okay, don't spoil it. I'm quite happy making a lot of money type nonsense words that power websites that don't matter. Yeah, exactly that, man. I agree. Twitter is such a bubble. Super false reality.

14:02:17

I don't think it's bad if you have multiple intentions and some of them are for you and others to help others. Yeah, it's a complicated thing. Intentions. It's impossible to suss it all out. It's okay. His wife doesn't have feelings for him. Stop it.

14:03:01

14:03:12
<transcript>: I got to eat my larvae. I'm hungry.

14:03:17
<transcript>: Confirmed Adam getting a lot of money working for himself as being a hitman.

14:03:22
<transcript>: Anything against the status quo, probably going to be perceived as bad intentions.

14:03:26
<transcript>: Change is bad. Yeah, I know that's what people feel.

14:03:34
<transcript>: I'm trying to catch up am I catching up.

14:03:38
<transcript>: I'm upset no one made an ozark joke when I am said he makes a ton of money.

14:03:43
thdxr: when we recording?

14:03:44
<transcript>: I found that so many people.

14:03:44
<transcript>: stopped on me

14:03:50
<transcript>: Stopped on me when I started talking about my success. I wonder why, though. Maybe it should sound maybe it sound like bragging.

14:03:53
<transcript>: You may be just a bit on Spectrum psychopath. Okay.

14:03:53
<transcript>: that sounds

14:03:55
<transcript>: That sounds much better.

14:03:55
<transcript>: have a great

14:03:57
<transcript>: Have a great motivation to build something that I don't.

14:03:57
<transcript>: i really don't

14:04:00
<transcript>: I really don't know what to build any advice.

14:04:05
jokestera_e: Are you and Dax gunna share startup stories in your podcast?

14:04:06
<transcript>: So.

14:04:06
<transcript>: what we're

14:04:08
<transcript>: What we're worked for.

14:04:11
<transcript>: Is.

14:04:11
<transcript>: we wrote down

14:04:12
<transcript>: We wrote down.

14:04:12
<transcript>: my

14:04:13
joaogomesdev: I want to start streaming, some tip?

14:04:17
<transcript>: My cofounder and I knew we want to build something together. We wrote down a list of, like, eight ideas.

14:04:17
<transcript>: and we

14:04:31
<transcript>: And we spent, like a whole day just, like going back and forth on pros and cons all these things. We ended up building sap muse because this was one we were most interested in. I think that helps when you're spending so much time and devoted to this thing.

14:04:31
<transcript>: if you really care

14:04:33
dmdboi: @joaogomesdev Press "start streaming"

14:04:38
<transcript>: If you really care about the product and you want it to exist for yourself helps a ton obviously other people there have to be other people like you.

14:04:38
<transcript>: that

14:04:43
<transcript>: That are going to enjoy it too. The other thing I would say is.

14:04:43
<transcript>: finding

14:04:46
mattmancodes: and eat larabars

14:04:47
<transcript>: Finding if you have a set of ideas and you can't pick.

14:04:47
<transcript>: finding

14:04:54
<transcript>: Finding one that people are most passionate about the thing. So sports people are really passionate about sports. I think that's helped stapmies a lot.

14:04:54
<transcript>: like we built something

14:04:59
joaogomesdev: @joaogomesdev true

14:05:02
<transcript>: Like, we built something that makes their sports experience a little better. They're very passionate about sports. So suddenly, they're very passionate about stat, muse. And that spread it really well.

14:05:04

14:05:05

<transcript>: Yeah.

14:05:20
aj_stuyvenberg: Yup that's super true, sports tech is a nice niche because fans are fanatic

14:05:20
<transcript>: I don't feel like.

14:05:20
<transcript>: i don't know what

14:05:34
<transcript>: I don't know what letters I have. I think I have some letters, though. I got fired once turned out to be the best thing to happen. It can. It can turn into the best thing. No. That was part of the conversation about getting people mad at your content or reacting. That's an old comment. I'm so behind.

14:05:49
samhuckaby: I've gotta go to standup, but I will say on the startup/side-project front that it really helps to have another person who wants to work with you. I can't even count  the number of projects I built that I was excited about that died because I had no accountability.

14:05:56
<transcript>: Okay. I think I'm caught up.

14:05:59
smilingbig: some letters KEKW

14:06:01
<transcript>: When we're recording? Oh, yeah. Dax, you want to now.

14:06:01
<transcript>: what's up

14:06:05
<transcript>: What's up? Are you and dax going to share startup stories in your podcast? We should.

14:06:08
<transcript>: We did a little bit of talking about startups.

14:06:15
<transcript>: Joa, welcome to my chat. I want to start streaming some tips.

14:06:17
<transcript>: So many tips.

14:06:31
<transcript>: I have a ton? It's hard to distill them all? You just gotta try the first fewer you're gonna it's gonna be awkward? You're not gonna know what to say? Nobody's gonna be watching? But if you have here's my biggest tip.

14:06:31
<transcript>: don't

14:06:34
<transcript>: Don't start streaming if you don't have.

14:06:34
<transcript>: some kind

14:06:36
<transcript>: Some kind of an audience elsewhere.

14:06:36
<transcript>: i see

14:06:44
<transcript>: I see people start streaming and like that's the first thing they've done online, they don't really have, like a Twitter following or a YouTube account or something.

14:06:44
<transcript>: and i think

14:06:47
<transcript>: And I think you're going to stream for a long time to nobody.

14:06:47
<transcript>: and

14:06:52
<transcript>: And that'd probably be pretty disheartening. So I would build up like a Twitter following or something first.

14:06:52
<transcript>: and

14:06:54
<transcript>: And that's what I did. I.

14:06:54
<transcript>: 've just been on

14:06:58
<transcript>: 've just been on converting my Twitter following to twitch viewers.

14:07:00
warrenbuffering: @thdxr hahahaha

14:07:02
<transcript>: Because it's more fun to hang out on twitch than Twitter. For me.

14:07:10
<transcript>: Superjee Sports, tech.

14:07:10

14:07:14
<transcript>: Is a nice niche because fans are fanatic exactly.

14:07:17
thdxr: where do i go

14:07:23
<transcript>: Csa, I'm going to go stand up, but I will say on the startup side project front that really helps have another person who wants to work with you can't even count the number of projects I built. Yes.

14:07:33
<transcript>: Actually having a co founder, and you both are in this and you quit your job and you're doing this that just like made sure we didn't just quit.

14:07:43
mhuggins7278: We recently discovered Kodiak Bars so good

14:07:44
<transcript>: Neither one of us was going to drop out like we're going to do this together. And then eventually you get investors involved. Once people have put money into it, even family and friends. Once there's money on the line.

14:07:48
<transcript>: You're accountable to them. It does help a ton like side projects.

14:07:48
<transcript>: by yourself even

14:07:57
<transcript>: By yourself, even if you're able to build the whole thing and market the whole thing and do it all yourself, it's so much harder to do it alone because you don't have anybody who's going to make sure you keep going.

14:07:59
<transcript>: Okay.

14:07:59
<transcript>: what

14:08:04

14:20:41
<transcript>: Alan's here.

14:20:52
<transcript>: I still don't know what we're talking about on the podcast. Do you know what we're talking about? Have we decided.

14:20:56
<transcript>: Oh Yeah.

14:21:06
<transcript>: What was the question format? Oh, like answering people's questions.

14:21:15
<transcript>: Yes.

14:21:22
<transcript>: Love it.

14:21:27
<transcript>: Oh, let me let me name the recording. What is this episode number.

14:21:31
<transcript>: Do you know what numbers.

14:21:34
<transcript>: Look.

14:21:34
<transcript>: three

14:21:36
<transcript>: Three.

14:21:39
<transcript>: This will be 18.

14:21:45
<transcript>: I know seems like more.

14:22:09
<transcript>: I think like for being a 25 to 30 minutes episode. I think people expect a couple of times a week that's most podcasts I listen to are like two, three times a week when they're 30 minutes episodes. I think if they were like an hour.

14:22:09
<transcript>: maybe

14:22:10
<transcript>: Maybe.

14:22:10
<transcript>: i don't know why

14:22:16
<transcript>: I don't know why that is. I don't know why people have that expectation. Why I have that expectation. But I do think.

14:22:16
<transcript>: there's

14:22:20
<transcript>: There's a reason people say that they want us to do it more.

14:22:30
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:22:37
<transcript>: I think we should have one episode that's just like.

14:22:37
<transcript>: a mailbag

14:22:41
<transcript>: A mailbag with a bunch of recurring segments that we do or something.

14:22:46
<transcript>: That just makes it really easy. We don't have to think about it. We just, like, get on. We record.

14:22:59
<transcript>: We definitely need to come up with some recurring segments, so we're not just like, one conversation, every episode. Like where it's like, here's a thing we do.

14:23:08
<transcript>: Just structures. It a little bit more.

14:23:10
<transcript>: I will say.

14:23:10
<transcript>: my wife

14:23:18
<transcript>: My wife watches TikTok, and there's a lot of two guys on a podcast on TikTok, like a lot of it. And they're hilarious. We're not hilarious, but we should try.

14:23:18
<transcript>: because i think

14:23:21
<transcript>: Because I think we do really well on TikTok.

14:23:23
<transcript>: It's some funny stuff.

14:23:23
<transcript>: we watch

14:23:25
<transcript>: We watch them a lot.

14:23:37
<transcript>: Yeah. Send them to you.

14:23:39
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:23:56
<transcript>: Favorite Open source maintainer great question, Teach, favorite Open source maintainer I only sponsor one. So there's your answer. Teach.

14:23:56
<transcript>: i sponsor

14:23:59
<transcript>: I sponsor Teach. Oh, you're an open source maintainer day.

14:24:02
<transcript>: I guess I could sponsor you.

14:24:05
<transcript>: Oh really.

14:24:09
<transcript>: Well, there you go. I knew that.

14:24:22
<transcript>: Okay, but I could get one in at the wire.

14:24:31
<transcript>: That's awesome.

14:24:35
<transcript>: Oh, we're talking about Open Source today. That was an on point question.

14:24:39
<transcript>: That was a great question about open source.

14:24:48
<transcript>: Okay, getting an open source. I'm ready to do this. Oh, I'm going to be bringing up the cdk and stuff, and you're going to get spicy. It's going to be good.

14:24:54
<transcript>: Because that was my beginning of open Source. That's how I got started.

14:24:59
<transcript>: Oh, right. They don't like you.

14:24:59
<transcript>: i wonder how

14:25:05
<transcript>: I wonder how that works. Because they like me. At least they did. They might not like me because I associate with you.

14:25:14
<transcript>: Because I'm just thinking, like if they really don't like you wonder how that works? Because I know there's people there that like me. Okay. Anyway, let's record.

14:25:23
<transcript>: Okay, we're here now. Okay? We don't need your hitman money. There's 17 of us. There are dozens. There's not even.

14:25:25
<transcript>: Oh, really? Mine says 17.

14:25:25
<transcript>: okay

14:25:28
<transcript>: Okay, so there are some people here. I did successfully raid you.

14:26:07
<transcript>: Are you ready.

14:26:07
<transcript>: i

14:26:14
<transcript>: I don't know why I even ask. It's not like a big pressure moment. We can always not be ready. Have you noticed that, Chris.

14:26:14
<transcript>: will cut out

14:26:21
<transcript>: Will cut out cool parts in the middle to make our intro so we don't have to think about anymore. It takes all the pressure off. We can just kind of go into it however you want.

14:26:25
<transcript>: I know, Yeah.

14:26:38
<transcript>: It's just hard to get into a conversation, especially when you know you're doing it. It's a forced way, like you're trying to start a podcast. Okay, let's just do it. So next, how'd you get into open source.

14:26:59
<transcript>: Obviously.

14:27:09
<transcript>: I mean, if you suck now, then obviously you sucked at that age. I'm just kidding. That was like me having a dig at you. Okay. Sorry. Keep going. Yeah, I know.

14:28:56
<transcript>: Wow.

14:30:33
<transcript>: Yeah. So I wanted to just let you keep going and, like, share all that very helpful information for our audience, because I'm sure they'll get a lot out of it. But the whole time I was just thinking how much I hate you. I thought you were millennial, like me.

14:30:36
<transcript>: I thought you were a late bloomer.

14:30:39
<transcript>: I've accomplished nothing until I was like 25 years old.

14:30:53
<transcript>: Don't even think I started writing code until I was 20 something. And I thought you were like me. I thought you were a millennial. But you're like the Gen Z people now who have done everything since they were like twelve. I didn't realize that about you. I didn't know that until just now.

14:31:05
<transcript>: Yeah. You've made fun of that with me. Like how accomplished some of these 16 year olds are.

14:31:53
<transcript>: Yeah, it's it's cool to think about how that all compounds like each generation should have.

14:31:53
<transcript>: like

14:32:00
<transcript>: Like earlier and earlier successes and and just people who are able to leverage all this stuff fully.

14:32:08
<transcript>: Yeah, it's interesting. The game thing. So I just finished reading Masters of doom. And anytime I read a book.

14:32:08
<transcript>: i have to

14:32:28
<transcript>: I have to find a way to interject that into a conversation. And you said something about games and open source. And in that book, John carmack talks about how they made doom, like, very extensible and all of the stuff he did with those early games, quake and doom and all those it was like a big part of it was open source. And he's like, a big, like, everything should be open source, person.

14:32:28
<transcript>: do you feel that way do you

14:32:33
<transcript>: Do you feel that way? Do you feel like everything should be open source and anything that's not is evil.

14:33:51
<transcript>: Bye.

14:33:51
<transcript>: but

14:33:54
<transcript>: But what about like elastic search.

14:33:54
<transcript>: and like

14:34:02
<transcript>: And like aws, and like taking people's stuff and then making a whole service on it. Isn't that the counterpoint.

14:34:08
<transcript>: Did they just not have the license in time? Is that what the problem was.

14:34:42
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:35:06
<transcript>: Interesting.

14:35:11
<transcript>: I have all kinds of questions that are not really where we're supposed to be going with this episode.

14:35:11
<transcript>: so i'm going to

14:35:23
<transcript>: So I'm going to shift into things I think we are supposed to talk about which is getting into open source. You think everyone should try and start their career that way? Or if you're new to open source, you need to dive in. It'll benefit your career no matter who you are.

14:38:39
<transcript>: Yeah. So you you really look at it that way. I know you do because you I feel like you're like an open source investor.

14:38:39
<transcript>: like you find

14:38:58
<transcript>: Like, you find projects early and you like, pump them up. Now you're in a position now where you have some influence and you can like you you evaluate it and you're like, these people are doing the right thing. They're they're they're this is an area that's impactful and they're executing. Well, I mean, I'm just thinking of drizzle. I'm specifically thinking of drizzle. You've done it with other stuff, though.

14:38:58
<transcript>: where you find

14:39:00
<transcript>: Where you find things really early.

14:39:02
<transcript>: And I don't.

14:39:02
<transcript>: does everyone have

14:39:05
<transcript>: Does everyone have that? Can everyone do that.

14:39:08
<transcript>: Is that a unique skill of yours.

14:40:14
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:40:51
<transcript>: So that was I think that was my next question is like, what are the downsides here? Or what's the risk? If you invest heavily in something that doesn't go anywhere? Is it better to kind of sprinkle yourself.

14:40:51
<transcript>: amongst

14:40:59
<transcript>: Amongst multiple open source projects when you're early and you're trying to find a place in a community and then find which one has more traction. Double down.

14:41:13
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:42:12
<transcript>: Still time to get it on quick jump in there people.

14:42:23
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:42:31
<transcript>: You're getting something out of it? Yeah, it's not a complete loss.

14:42:34
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:42:49
<transcript>: So.

14:42:53
<transcript>: I feel like I love Open Source. Okay, I love it.

14:42:56
<transcript>: It's enabled so many things in my career. It's great.

14:42:56
<transcript>: but i don't feel like

14:43:02
<transcript>: But I don't feel like I'm a true open source person. I feel like you have to adopt a creed.

14:43:02
<transcript>: it'll sign

14:43:13
<transcript>: It'll sign something in blood that you will never do another thing in software that's not open source or something. I don't know. You have to really sell your soul to the open source community.

14:43:20
<transcript>: I have used open source in sort of like a pragmatic way. I've contributed in a very pragmatic way.

14:43:21
<transcript>: When I need something.

14:43:21
<transcript>: i

14:43:33
<transcript>: I need a feature and a thing I use a lot and it's open source. I know I can just submit a PR and that's basically all my contributions of open source have just been thing I use doesn't do thing I needed to do. I'm going to make it do that thing.

14:43:41
<transcript>: Does that make me like, do you guys all just look down on people like me? Are you even aware that I exist.

14:44:23
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:46:04
<transcript>: We've all used something.

14:46:04
<transcript>: in open source

14:46:15
<transcript>: In open source and relied on it even heavily. And then it lost the ability to maintain itself like it lost funding, or it never really had it. And the people who were maintaining it just had other things to do.

14:46:22
<transcript>: Like you said, alignment of incentives when an open source project is healthy and making money.

14:46:22
<transcript>: where does it come from

14:46:23
<transcript>: Where does it come from.

14:46:23
<transcript>: do you

14:46:26
<transcript>: Do you understand? Maybe you could help me understand.

14:46:31
<transcript>: The sort of zealots that don't think you should make money with software.

14:46:35
<transcript>: Could you tell me what your dax brain has figured out about that.

14:46:40
<transcript>: The good argument for that.

14:46:49
<transcript>: Are we about to get into, like capitalism and stuff. Is that where we're headed.

14:46:53
<transcript>: Oh, boy. All right, let's do it.

14:47:49
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:48:57
<transcript>: This keeps coming up just in the last few days for me.

14:48:57
<transcript>: in my brain

14:49:00
<transcript>: In my brain. The idea that.

14:49:00
<transcript>: no

14:49:08
<transcript>: No intentions can be completely pure. And I think the more we're just honest with that. And we just accept that our intentions.

14:49:23
<transcript>: Are largely selfish or at least partially selfish. And the more upfront about that we are. I think that's the best we can do in terms of being honest with ourselves and with everyone else. I think you get into trouble when you start trying to pretend or start trying to convince people that all of your motives.

14:49:23
<transcript>: are pure your

14:49:26
<transcript>: Are pure. Your intentions are good.

14:49:28
<transcript>: It's all just so complicated.

14:49:57
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:51:27
<transcript>: No, that sounds great. I've never had those dreams of just being an open source maintainer, but I know that there's something for everybody.

14:51:27
<transcript>: it

14:51:30
<transcript>: It seems to be working for you you seem to enjoy it.

14:51:38
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:51:51
<transcript>: Sure.

14:52:02
<transcript>: Yeah, I have nothing else to add. I mean, I'm not much of a contributor to open source, so I don't have much to contribute to this conversation.

14:52:19
<transcript>: Yeah. So I started. I mean, my first open source contribution was to the cdk, I think.

14:52:24
<transcript>: And it was that I was working with a python shop. And.

14:52:24
<transcript>: we

14:52:34
<transcript>: We were using the cdk. We were using it in python, and there wasn't an easy way to bundle up python Lambda functions. So there was like no js function as a construct that'll bundle.

14:52:50
<transcript>: Your thing up. You don't have to think about it. You just write the code and it just ships it. There wasn't equivalent for python. So I made a python function construct, which was basically just like copying the node js one, but doing python things. Pip, installing, dependencies and all that stuff.

14:52:50
<transcript>: that was my

14:53:00
<transcript>: That was my first contribution I had gotten. I think I did what you said. Actually, in retrospect, I was kind of plugged into the cdk community because I was using it so much.

14:53:00
<transcript>: i don't remember if it

14:53:06
<transcript>: I don't remember if it's slack or discord wherever I was kind of in that community, I was seeing a lot of the github activity just because.

14:53:22
<transcript>: I wanted to know when there were some new feature or something new that we could take advantage of in the cdk. So before I ever contributed, I was definitely doing that. I was kind of like active member, and then at some point needed something and put out a PR for it. Learned a lot just about.

14:53:22
<transcript>: the process

14:53:39
<transcript>: The process of working with maintainers and kind of like especially how aws does Open Source. And there's actually a team that's meeting every day and talking about their stuff behind the veil, and then you get little inklings of it out. I know that's not necessarily.

14:53:45
<transcript>: Doesn't apply everywhere with open source, but for an aws project, that was my first.

14:53:45
<transcript>: and then

14:53:47
<transcript>: And then I think from there.

14:53:47
<transcript>: it was kind of like cool

14:53:57
<transcript>: It was kind of like, cool to see it merged. I remember the day I can remember being so excited when they merged. It telling my wife about it. She's like, okay, cool. Sounds awesome. What are these words.

14:54:05
<transcript>: And then from there, I think I did other things like that. Like I was using turbo repo pretty early with turbo repo and.

14:54:05
<transcript>: it was like

14:54:25
<transcript>: It was like I had played with Go in my career, didn't have a lot of experience with it, and kind of wanted a reason to do more ghost stuff just to see what's this like. And there was something it didn't do for cdk projects. So it kind of like started with cdk that led into other projects I'm using. They didn't work well together. So I shipped a PR, the turbo repo to make it cache.

14:54:25
<transcript>: cdk

14:54:27
<transcript>: Cdk stuff better.

14:54:27
<transcript>: and just

14:54:35
<transcript>: And just kind of like, down the line. It was like every time I ran into new things on any given project where I was fitting together technologies that maybe.

14:54:45
<transcript>: Not a lot of people were fitting together, so I had kind of a weird use case. Open source, made it possible to go in and contribute to those projects and make it possible to do what I wanted to do.

14:54:45
<transcript>: so

14:54:54
<transcript>: So I think that's the biggest thing is just kind of like being off the beaten path in terms of my stack. In terms of things that interest me, this intersection of web development and AWS.

14:55:00
<transcript>: That really kind of like led me down a very pragmatic open source journey, if that makes sense.

14:55:26
<transcript>: Yeah, yeah. I mean the cdk as a project like anybody could go contribute to cdk because there's just so much service area.

14:55:26
<transcript>: and if you know

14:55:40
<transcript>: And if you know what the cdk is, it's like trying to kind of cover all of aws. So ssc is great because it just focuses on the 2% that you really need. The cdk is like a wrapper around cloud formation, so there's just infinite work in that repo.

14:55:50
<transcript>: Like if you're into aws stuff and you need a repo to look at, there you go. I don't know. Does sst take contribution time? Do you guys actually have much community stuff.

14:56:55
<transcript>: I was totally listening. I was Chris, you might have to edit this somehow. I just noticed in Chat that T is here. In chat.

14:56:57
<transcript>: Yeah.
