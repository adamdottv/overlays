nullchefo: HeyGuys

00:08:38
sargath666: bows @adamdotdev

00:10:37
<transcript>: Let's go, let's go, let's go.

00:10:40
<transcript>: Let's go.

00:11:01
<transcript>: Griffith.

00:11:01
<transcript>: thank you

00:11:06
<transcript>: Thank you so much. Thank you for that follow. I appreciate that you haven't even seen me yet.

00:11:06
<transcript>: haven't even seen

00:11:08
<transcript>: Haven't even seen the stream.

00:11:08
<transcript>: game of the old

00:11:11
<transcript>: Game of the old follow I guess the intro you saw that.

00:11:14
<transcript>: Good day to everybody.

00:11:20
<transcript>: Who's here? Fatten is here. Welcome to Chat. Fattened. Yodel.

00:11:20
<transcript>: was her yodeling

00:11:22
<transcript>: Was her yodeling in my intro.

00:11:22
<transcript>: no shepp

00:11:24
<transcript>: No, sheppos here. And Sarga.

00:11:29
<transcript>: How's everybody doing? I just knocked stuff out off my desk.

00:11:32
<transcript>: All right.

00:11:36
<transcript>: You know what today is going to be.

00:11:48
<transcript>: A fantastic day. Fantastic stream. I've had some bad ones on the last few days. I feel like I've been in a like. I started with good intentions. I started my day. I thought.

00:11:48
<transcript>: i'm excited to work

00:12:01
<transcript>: I'm excited to work on this thing. And then just like stuff happened, you know, those days when you're programming and like just it feels like everything is actively, like fighting you and hates you. Your editor.

00:12:01
<transcript>: the code

00:12:03
<transcript>: The code.

00:12:03
<transcript>: the

00:12:06
<transcript>: The idea of the project, just all of it.

00:12:11
<transcript>: That was yesterday for sure. We did stuff with like SVG, sprites.

00:12:11
<transcript>: kind of wanted

00:12:12
sargath666: yeah impostor syndrome :)

00:12:15
<transcript>: Kind of wanted to die. Never wanted to touch a computer again.

00:12:15
<transcript>: imposter syndrome

00:12:17
sargath666: I have this all the time

00:12:19
<transcript>: Imposter Syndrome. Is that what that's called? I hear that a lot. And I never really knew what it was. But.

00:12:19
<transcript>: i think that

00:12:21
<transcript>: I think that's what it is.

00:12:21
<transcript>: yeah

00:12:23
developmentrobot: everyone has those days

00:12:28
<transcript>: Yeah. Yesterday was one of those days. You have it all the time. Okay. So I'm not alone. Everyone has those days today.

00:12:28
<transcript>: today's

00:12:38
<transcript>: Today's gonna be a good day because I think when I'm on stream, sometimes I don't step back and look at the situation and say, like, Wait a minute, wait.

00:12:41
<transcript>: Do we need to even solve this problem.

00:12:44
<transcript>: And after I got off stream Yesterday, I realized.

00:12:44
<transcript>: there

00:12:46
<transcript>: There are other solutions.

00:12:46
<transcript>: and i

00:12:51
<transcript>: And I wish I would think of that while I'm on stream so it'll go 4 hours.

00:12:51
<transcript>: it's like

00:12:56
<transcript>: It's like banging my head into the one problem. But that's okay. Today is gonna be better for it.

00:12:56
<transcript>: so we're building

00:12:59
<transcript>: So we're building AW guess.

00:12:59
<transcript>: i'm very excited

00:13:00
<transcript>: I'm very excited.

00:13:00
<transcript>: i don't

00:13:17
<transcript>: I don't know. Why do I do this? This intro thing? Do I need to do this? Should I just jump straight into it? I should just, like, start the stream. I'm already like, mid since deep in some code, and I'm like, oh, hey, everybody. What's up? Or should I should I keep doing this? I don't know. I have this little, like, opening monologue.

00:13:23
<transcript>: I do have some things to talk about today, but I'm not gonna lead with it.

00:13:28
<transcript>: We'll just we'll get into some stuff first. Let's just do it. I'm not gonna turn on some music.

00:13:31
<transcript>: We're just here to.

00:13:35
<transcript>: Just fix yesterday's woes.

00:13:35
<transcript>: we're gonna

00:13:37
<transcript>: We're gonna avenge.

00:13:42
<transcript>: Defend my honor. My programming feels.

00:13:42
<transcript>: yesterday

00:13:43
lhnng_aws: Curios if you have a video where I can review your streaming setup?

00:13:45
<transcript>: Yesterday? Not good today? Gonna be good.

00:13:45
<transcript>: gonna be better

00:13:52
<transcript>: Gonna be better so the revelation I had and I don't know if anyone here is.

00:13:52
<transcript>: aware of what

00:13:54
<transcript>: Aware of what I was doing yesterday.

00:13:57
<transcript>: And I don't want to rehash too much because it was a nice.

00:14:00
<transcript>: Thing.

00:14:06
<transcript>: I'm making an AWS guessing game. It's called a View. Guess.

00:14:06
<transcript>: which is a great

00:14:09
<transcript>: Which is a great name that I did not come up with.

00:14:19
<transcript>: That was Cube is here on Twitch. Who gave me that idea? So you have this? Oh, does it even work right now? Yeah.

00:14:19
<transcript>: you have this

00:14:22
<transcript>: You have this like you see an AWS Service icon. You have to guess, what is it.

00:14:29
<transcript>: And then you click the icon. And it's a game, right? It's a game. And these were all SVGs.

00:14:32
<transcript>: The issue I was running into. Thank you for the follow.

00:14:34
<transcript>: following

00:14:35
<transcript>: Following.

00:14:40
<transcript>: The issue I was running into so instead of downloading each SDG individually.

00:14:53
<transcript>: That's how bad, because your network bandwidth then could affect your score because you're waiting on the SVG to download, maybe on a slow mobile connection. And while you're waiting, the game's timer is ticking.

00:14:53
<transcript>: and you're losing

00:14:59
<transcript>: And you're losing precious time where you could be guessing and trying to get to the next thing you know the next round.

00:14:59
<transcript>: so i thought

00:15:03
<transcript>: So I thought, Well, I should Bake the SVGs into the bundle.

00:15:03
<transcript>: and when i

00:15:09
daglee: The 1-on-1... need to save up for that. Need help with my crypto code in rust. ;)

00:15:09
<transcript>: And when I did that, the bundle becomes giant. It's like an 800K uncompressed JavaScript bundle.

00:15:09
<transcript>: so then

00:15:12
ayehia0: nice theme btw, is this tmux ?

00:15:14
<transcript>: So then I was looking into SVG sprites and how I could more efficiently.

00:15:14
<transcript>: hand

00:15:20
<transcript>: Handle this with Sprites and just moving the viewport around and allow the browser to cache one big SVG Sprite file.

00:15:20
<transcript>: and that's

00:15:24
<transcript>: And that's what I bang my head on so hard yesterday.

00:15:35
<transcript>: Because there's a Chrome bug and you're seeing it right now. Chrome won't render the background, it won't render linear gradients and SDG sprites, which is super annoying edge case kind of thing.

00:15:35
<transcript>: firefox

00:15:38
<transcript>: Firefox handles it fine. Other browsers. They're fine.

00:15:50
<transcript>: So I got so stuck trying to, like, come up with a workaround in Chrome to make this work right now, this doesn't have the background, that's the App Sync logo, and it doesn't have the background. And that's no good. And then I realized.

00:15:50
<transcript>: there's

00:15:50
developmentrobot: could have paused timer until the svg downloads?

00:16:00
<transcript>: There's a very efficient way to do this that doesn't involve a big 800K or one Meg SVG download. If somebody comes to AW guess and then I want to play.

00:16:00
<transcript>: the game

00:16:09
<transcript>: The game and I first experience with it. They have to download this one. Meg thing feels inefficient for 300 services that they'll never see the icons for.

00:16:14
<transcript>: Ultimately like, I think there's a more efficient path. And that is.

00:16:14
<transcript>: there's only

00:16:16
<transcript>: There's only eight different background colors.

00:16:24
<transcript>: They're all gradients because a Tobs services. So let's go to like here. All of these little these are service tiles.

00:16:24
<transcript>: all of them

00:16:29
<transcript>: All of them fall into a bucket. A category. So the red ones.

00:16:29
<transcript>: are like secure

00:16:31
<transcript>: Are like secure things.

00:16:31
<transcript>: the blue

00:16:33
<transcript>: The blue ones are the Data services.

00:16:36
<transcript>: Green.

00:16:36
<transcript>: or storage

00:16:37
<transcript>: Or storage.

00:16:43
<transcript>: Purple. Or like I think that's like the Analytics stack.

00:16:46
<transcript>: Or maybe not. That's what I love. Bouncing. I don't know.

00:16:46
<transcript>: this like

00:16:51
<transcript>: This like Peel color. That's all the Sage Maker and Ml Family stuff, all the AI stuff.

00:16:51
<transcript>: orange

00:16:56
<transcript>: Orange is compute. So basically there's like there's eight categories.

00:16:56
<transcript>: and

00:17:03
<transcript>: And I can compute just a normal CSS background with those gradients, or just a simple linear gradient.

00:17:03
<transcript>: for the

00:17:11
<transcript>: For the square. And then I can just I can take the white part of the SUG, which is just like a couple of paths.

00:17:11
<transcript>: in these things

00:17:19
<transcript>: In these things and I can just store just the path data and just basics before encode it and throw it.

00:17:19
<transcript>: in

00:17:28
<transcript>: In the payload in the response for each round. So each round you're just getting this path beta in that payload, it's pretty minimal.

00:17:28
<transcript>: when you're just taking

00:17:29
cowfacedude99: !today

00:17:29
fossabot: Today Adam is working on bitter, a serverless twitter. Built to test the limits of concurrency within the serverless world.

00:17:33
<transcript>: When you're just taking that part of the SVG, and then I'm constructing what is basically the visual.

00:17:33
<transcript>: from

00:17:38
<transcript>: From a few basic rules. Like what category does this thing live in.

00:17:38
<transcript>: etc

00:17:41
<transcript>: Etc. Okay. So that's what I'm doing.

00:17:46
<transcript>: Let's see. Curious if you have a video where I can review your streaming setup.

00:17:46
<transcript>: you know

00:17:50
<transcript>: You know, I haven't done one. I've talked about doing one for a long time.

00:17:59
<transcript>: I kind of want to make other video content before I jump straight to, like, medicine. Like, here's how I make content, but I'll do it eventually.

00:17:59
<transcript>: it's it's

00:18:01
<transcript>: It's it's pretty complicated.

00:18:01
<transcript>: my streaming

00:18:03
<transcript>: My streaming setup is.

00:18:03
<transcript>: it's a bit

00:18:06
<transcript>: It's a bit extra.

00:18:06
<transcript>: it's

00:18:08
<transcript>: It's a little bougie.

00:18:14
<transcript>: I kind of do this really hard when I do them like I go very hard and I.

00:18:14
<transcript>: have a studio

00:18:16
<transcript>: Have a studio now.

00:18:16
<transcript>: and my office

00:18:18
<transcript>: And My office is now.

00:18:18
<transcript>: filled

00:18:33
<transcript>: Filled with studio lights and stuff, so I. But I will do I'll do something eventually. The one on one need to save up for that. Need help with my cryptocote and rust. Well, I don't know anything about either of those things, Dagly, but I'd love to have oneonone call. Sounds so fun. No one has redeemed it yet.

00:18:36
<transcript>: Is it tmux? Yeah, it is T. Max.

00:18:36
<transcript>: this

00:18:40
<transcript>: This is the Dracula Color scheme.

00:18:47
<transcript>: Could have pause timer until the SVG downloads. Yeah, development robot. We could, but the problem. I think the problem with that.

00:18:47
<transcript>: hey cafe

00:18:48
cowfacedude99: btw beginbot is on the subd game, so you will have someone with you while you fool around LUL

00:18:49
<transcript>: Hey, cafe.

00:18:49
<transcript>: the problem

00:18:53
<transcript>: The problem with that is then the servers isn't sort of like owning the game state.

00:18:53
<transcript>: and

00:19:04
<transcript>: And the server. Well, would we send a message from the client to tell the server? Now we have the SVG start the timer backup. Like, I want the all the games to live on the server. And the client is just sort of.

00:19:08
<transcript>: Rendering stuff right.

00:19:08
<transcript>: phil

00:19:10
<transcript>: Phil, thank you for the follow.

00:19:15
phil_massicotte: heya

00:19:20
<transcript>: That's not what we're doing today. Cafes Begin Bot is on the subdiv game so you'll have someone walk with you while you fool around interesting.

00:19:29
<transcript>: Cool. Yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna mess around with Subd that's on my list after Reinvent just got so many things I'm trying to do before Reinvent. Welcome to Chat, Phil.

00:19:37
ayehia0: would you share your dotfiles ?

00:19:42
<transcript>: Alright. So let's do this. So I'm going to we're gonna figure out these categories. Would you share my daffods? Yeah, Yeah.

00:19:42
<transcript>: they're right here

00:19:43
adamdotdev: !dotfiles

00:19:43
fossabot: Adam's dotfiles live here: https://github.com/adamelmore/dotfiles The repository for bitter is here: https://github.com/adamelmore/bitter

00:19:44
<transcript>: They're right here.

00:19:47
<transcript>: Not all my commands are up to date.

00:19:47
<transcript>: some of them are

00:19:49
<transcript>: Some of them are.

00:19:51
<transcript>: Ignored the bitter thing.

00:19:55
<transcript>: I'm so spazy I'm just all over the place.

00:19:55
<transcript>: so my command

00:19:57
<transcript>: So my commands are very hard to stay on top of.

00:19:59
<transcript>: Okay.

00:20:03
<transcript>: We're gonna kill this thing.

00:20:03
<transcript>: and here's

00:20:06
<transcript>: And here's what I was doing. I'm trying to figure out.

00:20:08
<transcript>: What.

00:20:12
<transcript>: Okay.

00:20:19
<transcript>: This thing right here. I'm trying to figure out here are the eight different colors.

00:20:21
<transcript>: They're the first color in the gradient.

00:20:28
<transcript>: Inside all those SUG files. And then I've put like an example service so I could figure out what they each mean.

00:20:32
<transcript>: So let's see the.

00:20:35
<transcript>: Let's let's just do this.

00:20:36
cowfacedude99: currently on learning spree for gcp associate exam on saturday. so you will be in the background :(

00:20:38
<transcript>: Let's copy and paste all this.

00:20:46
<transcript>: Did that. I copy.

00:20:49
<transcript>: Did not copy.

00:20:49
<transcript>: copy

00:20:50
<transcript>: Copy.

00:20:54
<transcript>: What.

00:20:54
<transcript>: what's going

00:20:55
<transcript>: What's going on.

00:20:57
<transcript>: What.

00:21:04
sargath666: copy, roger that ;)

00:21:06
<transcript>: Not today, not today neovem.

00:21:09
ayehia0: just yy

00:21:11
<transcript>: What is that stuff.

00:21:11
<transcript>: okay

00:21:12
<transcript>: Okay.

00:21:17
daddydepression96: copy pasting in vim KEKW

00:21:17
<transcript>: So here we go. We've got some categories. So let's do this.

00:21:19
<transcript>: Category.

00:21:26
<transcript>: And it's gonna be a map.

00:21:29
<transcript>: It's gonna be a map.

00:21:31
<transcript>: Like this.

00:21:33
<transcript>: Storage.

00:21:37
<transcript>: And then a color.

00:21:42
<transcript>: Now it needs to be a set of colors, I guess. Oh, I should have output of both colors.

00:21:52
<transcript>: Currently on a learning spree for GCP Associate exam on Saturday.

00:21:52
<transcript>: so you'll be in the

00:21:53
lhnng_aws: Love a bit of Alt-J while coding!

00:21:54
<transcript>: So you'll be in the background oh, no worries. Cafe.

00:21:58
<transcript>: You do that. I've done those learning sprees. Good times.

00:22:02
<transcript>: Good times. Just Why, why.

00:22:02
<transcript>: copy

00:22:05
<transcript>: Copy? Pasting and vim? Oh, what did I do.

00:22:05
<transcript>: just love a bit

00:22:11
<transcript>: Just love a bit of Alt JWY cutting. I do, too, and I don't love the shuffle right now.

00:22:13
<transcript>: But I'm gonna leave it.

00:22:13
<transcript>: okay

00:22:19
<transcript>: Okay. What was I doing? I was copying pasting. Can I just YY why? Why inside of this thing.

00:22:20
cowfacedude99: You used the mouse LUL

00:22:21
<transcript>: Like, how do I.

00:22:31
<transcript>: This is toggle term. How do I just treat it like a normal buffer and just move around. You're saying I can do that.

00:22:35
ayehia0: when you select

00:22:41
<transcript>: How do I do that.

00:22:41
<transcript>: i would love

00:22:44
<transcript>: I would love to not drag up here and be like this.

00:22:44
<transcript>: you're

00:22:51
daglee: exit terminal mode

00:22:54
<transcript>: You're saying I can copy that? Oh, I can just yank that it is a buffer. It's just. It has some weird behavior that I don't understand. Maybe other people understand. Pending.

00:22:54
<transcript>: what pin

00:22:56
<transcript>: What pining.

00:23:01
<transcript>: Is my editor? Frozen? Is Neil. I'm. Frozen. What.

00:23:01
<transcript>: pinning what

00:23:03
<transcript>: Pinning. What.

00:23:05
<transcript>: Ow, what just happened.

00:23:08
<transcript>: Okay.

00:23:10
<transcript>: Storage.

00:23:10
<transcript>: and

00:23:14
cowfacedude99: that's why I don't like toggleterm.

00:23:15
<transcript>: And the colors for storage are going to be.

00:23:22
<transcript>: So I don't like toggle term. Yeah. I'm starting to let I'm starting to not like toggle term as well.

00:23:26
cowfacedude99: I prefer to throw everything into another terminal

00:23:26
<transcript>: I use the mouse. I did.

00:23:26
<transcript>: i did

00:23:28
<transcript>: I did. I did okay.

00:23:28
<transcript>: i prefer

00:23:34
<transcript>: I prefer throw everything into another terminal. Oh, that's a good idea. I do, I do have I do have.

00:23:34
<transcript>: t mo

00:23:36
<transcript>: T mocks right here.

00:23:36
<transcript>: or

00:23:38
<transcript>: Or I could like just.

00:23:38
<transcript>: do

00:23:38
ayehia0: you can also enable copy mode in tmux : setw -g mode-keys vi

00:23:43
<transcript>: Do like that and have a pan. I already have that actually.

00:23:53
<transcript>: Yeah, I should just do that. I should just use those pains and not toggle term. I'm done with toggle tire.

00:23:53
<transcript>: you heard it here

00:23:58
madlep: Wanted to love toggleterm. Went back to plain old tmux panes

00:23:58
<transcript>: You heard it here first. I'm gonna do it, like, 500 times on this stream. Just out of reflex.

00:24:08
madlep: Fits my workflow

00:24:10
<transcript>: Going back the plain old tmux fan's. I think I'm with you. I'm with you all. I just like having the quick, like I've got like a quick key map.

00:24:10
<transcript>: feels good

00:24:12
<transcript>: Feels good to smash it.

00:24:12
<transcript>: there

00:24:14
<transcript>: There it is.

00:24:18
<transcript>: Yeah, I might be done with target Herm so I can break the habit.

00:24:23
neochromer: hello helllo

00:24:27
<transcript>: Okay. So storage and the colors are going to are going to be we'll just do it as an array.

00:24:36
neochromer: I just came back from a meeting where my company has a project with AWS together..

00:24:37
cowfacedude99: that's why I have two panes. prefix+n is the best.

00:24:38
<transcript>: And now it's get the actual colors.

00:24:38
<transcript>: so

00:24:46
<transcript>: So store which one is a storage app? Stream Athena Aurora Chime EFS. It would be EFS, right? Yeah.

00:24:46
<transcript>: so this

00:24:51
cowfacedude99: @NeoChromer nice!!

00:24:53
<transcript>: So this is the first color stop. I'm gonna have to run this thing again, actually. And I'll have to put the second color in there. We'll just do like this.

00:24:55
neochromer: and 90% of the deveopment and technicall stuff is in India.. so there is no headroom for me / our team, to jump into it

00:24:59
<transcript>: So like this.

00:25:06
neochromer: sad about it

00:25:07
<transcript>: Stop. One color.

00:25:07
<transcript>: and then

00:25:08
<transcript>: And then we'll do like.

00:25:13
neochromer: they work with cloud devs from amazon

00:25:16
<transcript>: That stop. Two color.

00:25:17
neochromer: would have loved to join that

00:25:18
ayehia0: @cowfacedude99 what about prefix + c

00:25:25
<transcript>: Get out of here toggle term. We'll just do this.

00:25:28
<transcript>: And we'll say.

00:25:28
<transcript>: node

00:25:29
<transcript>: Node.

00:25:31
<transcript>: Script.

00:25:31
<transcript>: in code

00:25:32
<transcript>: In code.

00:25:32
<transcript>: images

00:25:35
<transcript>: Images MJS.

00:25:35
<transcript>: okay

00:25:36
<transcript>: Okay.

00:25:36
<transcript>: there we go

00:25:37
<transcript>: There we go.

00:25:41
<transcript>: So storage.

00:25:49
<transcript>: Storage goes from let's see.

00:25:52
<transcript>: Efs goes from one.

00:25:52
<transcript>: b six

00:25:54
<transcript>: B Six 60 F.

00:25:57
<transcript>: Two.

00:26:02
<transcript>: Six.

00:26:03
<transcript>: Ca.

00:26:06
cowfacedude99: @cowfacedude99 I use prefix n for next pane and prefix + e for last session. both are a lifesaver for me.

00:26:08
<transcript>: cast the color

00:26:08
<transcript>: cast the color stops

00:26:09
<transcript>: Cast the color stops for storage.

00:26:11
daglee: So, in vim you have a term mode, where you can bind special keybindings etc. You can still exit terminal mode and go to normal mode and treat it like a normal buffer (and select text).

00:26:19
<transcript>: You all nerding out of her Team X stuff right now, aren't you.

00:26:29
<transcript>: 90% of development in tentacle stuff is in India, so there's no headroom for me our team to jump into. Oh, I missed something here. Hello? Hello, neocromer.

00:26:35
<transcript>: Just came back from a meeting where my company has a project with AWS together. Hey, that's fun.

00:26:48
<transcript>: Of development title stuff in India. So there's no headroom for me. Our team to jump into it. Sad about it all. They work with Cloud Devs from Amazon would love to join that. That sounds like fun.

00:26:55
ayehia0: you can use this plugin to show the colors in nvim : https://github.com/norcalli/nvim-colorizer.lua

00:26:56
<transcript>: Okay, I'm just gonna I'm gonna step homer, step back from the vim team conversation.

00:26:59
<transcript>: I'll let you all.

00:26:59
<transcript>: work that

00:27:01
<transcript>: Work that out.

00:27:04
<transcript>: Okay, storage.

00:27:04
<transcript>: we're gonna have

00:27:05
<transcript>: We're gonna have compute.

00:27:09
<transcript>: And compute. Let's see.

00:27:09
<transcript>: app stream

00:27:14
neochromer: Why use tmux when I can open multiple temrinal 5Head

00:27:16
<transcript>: App Stream Application Auto Scaling API Gateway which one of these is going to be compute.

00:27:17
cowfacedude99: @daglee that's a nice idea too. I have seen teej use it a lot, but it never went in my workflow.

00:27:20
<transcript>: Let's see Amazon.

00:27:24
<transcript>: It might be application auto scaling.

00:27:33
<transcript>: I just have to open these. And that is that it? Yeah, that's compute. Orange is compute for sure.

00:27:38
<transcript>: If that's what that is. I don't know. That's what it is, though.

00:27:38
<transcript>: now

00:27:38
cowfacedude99: @NeoChromer If you use tiling wm than it is a good idea.

00:27:39
<transcript>: Now.

00:27:42
<transcript>: Application Deployment and monitoring.

00:27:48
<transcript>: I'm gonna have to just open these. We'll just open them on my file system.

00:27:48
<transcript>: i've got the

00:27:50
<transcript>: I've got the files right here.

00:27:53
<transcript>: So let's go to.

00:27:55
cowfacedude99: but for me, habits take priority :(

00:27:59
<transcript>: Code, playground.

00:28:04
<transcript>: Did my music stop.

00:28:08
<transcript>: I know just the end of that track.

00:28:08
<transcript>: eight of you

00:28:09
<transcript>: Eight of you guess.

00:28:12
<transcript>: We're gonna go into public hashed.

00:28:14
<transcript>: Original.

00:28:18
<transcript>: So we're gonna find what we need in here. So let's see.

00:28:22
<transcript>: Auto scaling no.

00:28:26
<transcript>: Application. How do I search in here? Quickly.

00:28:28
<transcript>: Application autoscaling.

00:28:32
ayehia0: @NeoChromer I use bspwm

00:28:36
<transcript>: Here it is. So I'm just gonna preview these. How do I open them.

00:28:45
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah, that's Compute. So it is application auto scaling that those are the compute colors.

00:28:48
<transcript>: So right here.

00:28:48
<transcript>: what

00:28:50
<transcript>: What F 90.

00:28:55
<transcript>: Does that mean the last three or zero if it doesn't have them.

00:28:55
<transcript>: i guess

00:28:56
<transcript>: I guess.

00:28:59
<transcript>: I'm guessing that's the case.

00:29:01
<transcript>: Compute goes from.

00:29:03
samjandwich: expands to #ff9900

00:29:04
<transcript>: C, eight, five.

00:29:04
<transcript>: one

00:29:05
samjandwich: iirc

00:29:06
<transcript>: One, One, B.

00:29:12
<transcript>: And it goes to F 90, just like that.

00:29:15
<transcript>: Zero, zero? I don't know.

00:29:15
<transcript>: color

00:29:17
<transcript>: Color.

00:29:17
<transcript>: text color

00:29:19
<transcript>: Text, Color Preview or something.

00:29:27
<transcript>: What the that's the ad that prime got. I saw this on Twitter.

00:29:27
<transcript>: oh my word

00:29:29
<transcript>: Oh, my word.

00:29:30
<transcript>: F.

00:29:30
<transcript>: nine zero

00:29:32
<transcript>: 90.

00:29:41
<transcript>: Here's your zero. Okay? Not you. Don't add zero. Zero. Do you add FFF no F 90 again. Now what.

00:29:41
<transcript>: how

00:29:41
trolzie: its like this: FF9900

00:29:43
<transcript>: How does that a color.

00:29:43
<transcript>: i

00:29:47
<transcript>: I thought they had to be six digits. Someone explained this to me.

00:29:51
<transcript>: Like I'm five F nine F F nine.

00:29:57
<transcript>: 90 oh, like you double them all. Thank you so much.

00:30:01
<transcript>: Ff 990 zero.

00:30:01
<transcript>: there

00:30:02
<transcript>: There it is.

00:30:02
<transcript>: frosty

00:30:05
<transcript>: Frosty. Welcome to Chat. Thank you for solving problems.

00:30:08
<transcript>: While you come into my chat.

00:30:08
<transcript>: let's

00:30:09
trolzie: np

00:30:10
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:30:16
daglee: "miss match pointer class <sq as Pointee>::Metadata == ()" and people say rust is easy.

00:30:16
<transcript>: Guys, you're still talking teamucks. Let's see Tyler, manager.

00:30:17
trolzie: web dev here on my break :)

00:30:21
<transcript>: Oh, and Sam Janwich. Also, thank you for.

00:30:21
<transcript>: expanding

00:30:28
<transcript>: Expanding that for me, Miss Pointer. Class sq as point. What do you. What are you people talking about? Oh, rust.

00:30:28
<transcript>: web

00:30:35
<transcript>: Webdev here on your break. Welcome, Charles E. I appreciate you joining us on your break.

00:30:39
<transcript>: When I take breaks, I leave it's the opposite.

00:30:39
<transcript>: of

00:30:41
<transcript>: Of your situation.

00:30:44
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:30:54
<transcript>: Sometimes people hit like a reward, and it takes over my keyboard. And that messes with my editor. So that's what that was.

00:30:58
<transcript>: Ff nine 90 cool. So that's compute.

00:30:58
<transcript>: next we're gonna

00:31:01
<transcript>: Next we're gonna do what are we gonna do next.

00:31:01
<transcript>: just

00:31:06
<transcript>: Just take the first one API gateway. What family does that fall in? Let's see.

00:31:06
<transcript>: api

00:31:08
<transcript>: Api, gateway.

00:31:16
<transcript>: Open with Chrome. This is that purple color. What family of sir? What I want to call that? You know what there's like.

00:31:25
<transcript>: Actually, there's a classification process. Aws Services I think there's names on their website that would help.

00:31:28
<transcript>: Products.

00:31:31
trolzie: magenta

00:31:35
<transcript>: Amazon Web Services Services is what I just asked. Oh, there they were. Here we go.

00:31:38
<transcript>: Computer.

00:31:38
<transcript>: computerbase

00:31:39
madlep: Is there an AWS service for classifying AWS services?

00:31:44
<transcript>: Computerbase Networking and Content delivery, analytics, Machine learning, security, Identity and compliance. Cool.

00:31:52
<transcript>: Is there an AWS Service for classifying advisors? There should be.

00:32:00
<transcript>: There should be so we did compute and storage we're gonna let's just do the order that they did them in so database is next.

00:32:07
<transcript>: Database which of these services is a database service? Aurora. So it's two e.

00:32:07
<transcript>: two

00:32:09
<transcript>: Two e.

00:32:15
<transcript>: Two, seven Ad. Thank you so much for the follow. Hello, Daniel.

00:32:15
<transcript>: hello

00:32:17
<transcript>: Hello, Daniel. Thank you so much for the follow.

00:32:21
<transcript>: And this one is gonna be.

00:32:23
samjandwich: https://github.com/b0o/aws-favicons-webextension cool browser extension for replacing generic aws favions with service specific ones

00:32:24
<transcript>: Five, two, seven.

00:32:36
<transcript>: Five, two, seven, FFF. So we're doing all this. We're doing this painful stuff to save a whole lot of compute and network bandwidth and do some stuff on the fly. That's just pretty cheap. Database.

00:32:36
<transcript>: networking

00:32:38
<transcript>: Networking. We'll call this one.

00:32:43
<transcript>: And the colors for networking, which I use is networking.

00:32:49
<transcript>: Excuse. Let's see. I just sniffled and I said, Excuse me. I don't know why.

00:32:52
<transcript>: Not Athena, is it.

00:32:54
<transcript>: App, stream.

00:32:56
ayehia0: why rewriting the hex color when you can copy from the commented array down ?

00:32:57
samjandwich: i find it super useful

00:32:58
<transcript>: What was auto scaling? I'm realizing. I don't remember. Oh, no.

00:33:00
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

00:33:07
<transcript>: Cool browser extension for replacing generic AWS savicons.

00:33:07
<transcript>: with services

00:33:10
<transcript>: With services. Oh, that's a cool idea.

00:33:15
<transcript>: Why are rewriting the Hex color when you can copy from the commented area down.

00:33:15
<transcript>: oh

00:33:24
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, yeah. I guess I could paste all this into my let's see, see if I'm smart enough. No, this is not invent so I'm gonna have to use my mouth.

00:33:24
<transcript>: i'm sorry everybody

00:33:26
<transcript>: I'm sorry, everybody.

00:33:26
<transcript>: using

00:33:27
<transcript>: Using my mouse.

00:33:30
<transcript>: Copy.

00:33:30
<transcript>: i'm gonna copy

00:33:32
<transcript>: I'm gonna copy all that.

00:33:35
<transcript>: I'm using it.

00:33:39
<transcript>: The mouse. It has been used. Okay, how do I copy this.

00:33:41
<transcript>: From my terminal.

00:33:42
ayehia0: yy

00:33:48
<transcript>: I guess that copied it by default. Yeah. There we go. Okay, now I can just do this. That's better.

00:33:50
<transcript>: I.

00:33:50
<transcript>: don't

00:33:52
<transcript>: Don't need that. Okay.

00:33:58
<transcript>: So now I can. I can just copy. Good call. Networking. Did I finish networking? No, I didn't.

00:33:58
<transcript>: networking

00:34:02
<transcript>: Networking. I got to figure out which of these services is a networking service.

00:34:02
<transcript>: let's look

00:34:05
<transcript>: Let's look at app stream.

00:34:10
player__piano: space key for quicklook in finder

00:34:12
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the follow trollsy.

00:34:12
<transcript>: for all the

00:34:13
<transcript>: For all the.

00:34:15
<transcript>: Yeah, I know how to copy.

00:34:20
<transcript>: In Indian. That was in just a terminal, though I can't. Why, why in a terminal.

00:34:20
<transcript>: space

00:34:25
<transcript>: Space key for QuickLook and Finder hey, that's a good idea. Player piano. Thank you so much.

00:34:25
<transcript>: thank you so much

00:34:31
<transcript>: Thank you so much. Look at this space key. You tell me that'll. Just. Oh, glorious.

00:34:31
<transcript>: is that the

00:34:36
<transcript>: Is that the networking family? Let's see, I gotta remember what color the networking family is.

00:34:42
ayehia0: you can yy since it's just a buffer

00:34:43
<transcript>: Networking. What is this? I thought this is gonna be a list of networking services.

00:34:43
<transcript>: it is

00:34:45
<transcript>: It is not.

00:34:45
<transcript>: oh clappy

00:34:51
<transcript>: Oh clappy. So yeah, it's whatever color cloud front is actually have cloud front on my wall and I don't remember.

00:34:53
<transcript>: Cloud front.

00:35:01
<transcript>: There it is. Space. Okay. So purple is networking. Is that what that one was.

00:35:03
<transcript>: This is such a weird game.

00:35:07
<transcript>: What would it app? Stream. Was it purple.

00:35:07
<transcript>: no

00:35:11
<transcript>: No teal. Okay, so app stream is like the.

00:35:19
<transcript>: Ml family. Which one of these is networking? It's not a Cena.

00:35:19
<transcript>: right

00:35:20
<transcript>: Right.

00:35:26
<transcript>: Oh, purple, Athena is purple, purple, networking? What.

00:35:26
<transcript>: i'm sorry

00:35:28
<transcript>: I'm sorry. What.

00:35:28
<transcript>: clapfron

00:35:30
ayehia0: oh nvm, I use kitty terminal and I copy text by selecting with mouse

00:35:31
<transcript>: Clapfront is the same as Athena. Oh.

00:35:31
<transcript>: okay

00:35:32
<transcript>: Okay.

00:35:32
<transcript>: that

00:35:34
<transcript>: That's surprising to me.

00:35:36
<transcript>: That's surprising.

00:35:39
<transcript>: You can why? Why? Since it's just a buffer.

00:35:39
<transcript>: oh

00:35:43
<transcript>: Oh Kitty sermon like copy text by selecting the mouth.

00:35:51
<transcript>: Yeah, it was actually like a TMX pain with just my charm? I'm running.

00:35:56
<transcript>: Cloud front. So this one, it's gonna be.

00:35:56
<transcript>: what was it

00:35:57
<transcript>: What was it.

00:36:05
<transcript>: Which one of these app stream? So app stream is purple? No.

00:36:05
<transcript>: why am i

00:36:14
<transcript>: Why am I so confused? Because it didn't make sense? Oh, yeah, acne, it doesn't make any sense to me, but that's fine. Networking is gonna be the colors of a theme.

00:36:14
<transcript>: so we'll go down

00:36:17
<transcript>: So we'll go down here and we'll say.

00:36:17
<transcript>: yang

00:36:20
<transcript>: Yangkward. And then we'll go up here.

00:36:23
<transcript>: Like right here.

00:36:23
<transcript>: and we'll

00:36:25
<transcript>: And we'll say, paste.

00:36:28
<transcript>: Or better way to do that.

00:36:32
<transcript>: See? Did I place it too many.

00:36:32
<transcript>: since ends

00:36:36
<transcript>: Since ends in Ad. Wait, what 24.

00:36:44
<transcript>: 24. Where is it? Athena? 40. What did I just do? Okay, I'm typing. It. 42. Seven, eight.

00:36:50
<transcript>: And this is a one, six, six, FF. Okay.

00:36:52
<transcript>: That's networking.

00:36:56
<transcript>: This one is going to be what.

00:37:01
<transcript>: What is next? Analytics. See? That's where Athena should live.

00:37:01
<transcript>: that's

00:37:03
<transcript>: That's where.

00:37:05
<transcript>: Anna lit. X.

00:37:05
<transcript>: analytics

00:37:06
codespent: Totally made that "sort issues by reaction count" browser extension and upon seeing your stream, I'm reminded that I abandoned at 80% complete Kappa

00:37:07
<transcript>: Analytics? Yeah.

00:37:14
<transcript>: Analytics is going to be not a Cena. What in the world? What would Analytics be.

00:37:15
codespent: Guess I know what's going down this weekend.

00:37:19
<transcript>: What's Twin maker look like.

00:37:24
<transcript>: Aws IoT Twin maker.

00:37:31
<transcript>: Is it green? Wait. That's storage.

00:37:34
<transcript>: We, what.

00:37:39
<transcript>: How does that make sense.

00:37:43
<transcript>: Oh, those are the same starting code.

00:37:49
<transcript>: They're just capitalization differences. Okay, so, Twinmakers, I can remove it.

00:37:49
<transcript>: one two three

00:37:51
<transcript>: One, two, three.

00:37:54
<transcript>: There's only seven guys. Is that right? Yeah.

00:37:54
<transcript>: okay

00:37:55
ayehia0: 1. Add setw -g mode-keys vi in your tmux config. 2. Ctrl + [ to enter tmux vi copy mode. 3. Move around with vim navigation keys. 4. Begin highlight with Space. 5. Copy with Enter. 6. Paste with Ctrl + ]  from google

00:37:56
<transcript>: Okay.

00:38:02
<transcript>: Totally made.

00:38:02
<transcript>: that

00:38:10
<transcript>: That sort issues by reaction count browser extension. You did. And upon seeming your stream, I'm reminded that I banned it at 80%. Complete.

00:38:13
<transcript>: Finish it up. Code spent.

00:38:20
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow techno.

00:38:27
<transcript>: Okay, so we're trying to find which one of these is analytics. Analytics. What color is analytics.

00:38:31
<transcript>: What services live under the Analytics umbrella.

00:38:38
<transcript>: Emr. Athena see it that doesn't make any sense. Athena should not be that color. People.

00:38:38
<transcript>: kinesis

00:38:43
<transcript>: Kinesis. Let's look up. Let's find Kinesis. Is it Amazon or a Tobs.

00:38:43
<transcript>: amazon

00:38:44
<transcript>: Amazon.

00:38:44
<transcript>: kinesis

00:38:46
<transcript>: Kinesis.

00:38:56
<transcript>: Is purple? Wait, are there two purples? Oh, there's two different purples. This makes so much more sense.

00:38:56
<transcript>: the cloud

00:38:58
<transcript>: The Cloud Front, purple.

00:38:58
<transcript>: is

00:39:00
<transcript>: Is a different purple.

00:39:00
<transcript>: maybe

00:39:01
<transcript>: Maybe.

00:39:05
<transcript>: Hang on, I got to look on my wall.

00:39:12
<transcript>: So confused.

00:39:12
daglee: Is that purple or blue?

00:39:15
<transcript>: I'm so confused.

00:39:17
assertionbit: Hi there

00:39:19
<transcript>: Oh, so I can just move these up and down. That's that's cool.

00:39:20
samjandwich: in the assets package here: https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/ when you download it, it has a dir called "Architecture Service Icons" which has 26 sub dirs

00:39:25
<transcript>: So we know cloud front should belong to the.

00:39:28
samjandwich: which seems to imply 26 categories :D

00:39:38
<transcript>: Upfront? Why is cloud front purple.

00:39:44
<transcript>: And is that a different purple? Let's just look in that. Let's inspect it.

00:39:47
<transcript>: Like, what is the color? Say.

00:39:47
<transcript>: for

00:39:52
<transcript>: For 247. Eight. Yeah, that's the networking color.

00:39:58
<transcript>: Or no. That's what I put into the networking. I don't know.

00:39:58
<transcript>: this is

00:39:59
<transcript>: This is so confusing.

00:39:59
<transcript>: maybe

00:40:05
<transcript>: Maybe I'll list out a few services for each one. I don't think this a lot easier, actually.

00:40:11
<transcript>: Make it a lot easier.

00:40:12
assertionbit: I think it is same

00:40:13
<transcript>: So up here.

00:40:17
madlep: In the future, everyone will be an AWS service for 15 minutes

00:40:18
<transcript>: Colors? Five.

00:40:25
<transcript>: We'll do we'll do filter. And it will just take, like the first three.

00:40:28
<transcript>: So here.

00:40:30
<transcript>: Slice.

00:40:31
samjandwich: so cloudfront is in "Networking and Content Delivery" category - which is a purple

00:40:35
<transcript>: Wait. Service? What is this? Color? Soft filter.

00:40:39
<transcript>: I got to do, like.

00:40:44
<transcript>: Slice.

00:40:44
<transcript>: we'll take four of them

00:40:45
<transcript>: We'll take four of them.

00:40:45
<transcript>: that map

00:40:46
<transcript>: That map.

00:40:50
<transcript>: Okay.

00:40:50
<transcript>: i know

00:40:53
<transcript>: I know this doesn't make sense. It shouldn't.

00:40:53
<transcript>: you were

00:40:57
<transcript>: You weren't here for all of that, okay.

00:41:05
<transcript>: There we go. So now we got a handful of services for each one.

00:41:09
<transcript>: Maybe.

00:41:09
<transcript>: too many

00:41:16
<transcript>: Too many. Wait. What is that? More than four. What did my slide stop work? Amazon FSX were open. So it's got all of them.

00:41:16
<transcript>: all

00:41:20
<transcript>: All of the services that belong in each family.

00:41:24
<transcript>: I did not slice it.

00:41:28
<transcript>: Oh, wait. This slice. Not what I was thinking.

00:41:31
<transcript>: Wait. What.

00:41:31
<transcript>: what did i

00:41:36
<transcript>: What did I do? Filter by color equals that.

00:41:40
<transcript>: And then slice.

00:41:44
<transcript>: Doesn't that just take the copy of the section of an array.

00:41:48
<transcript>: Oh if I just do one number Oh.

00:41:50
<transcript>: This would be like.

00:41:55
<transcript>: Zero. And then just take four of them. What.

00:41:57
<transcript>: Was that.

00:41:59
<transcript>: Like that.

00:41:59
<transcript>: you go into toggle

00:42:01
<transcript>: You go into toggle terms.

00:42:06
<transcript>: Okay, let's try this again.

00:42:06
<transcript>: that's better

00:42:07
<transcript>: That's better.

00:42:10
<transcript>: Any more room to work here.

00:42:15
<transcript>: Okay, let's copy all this.

00:42:21
<transcript>: Let's go in here.

00:42:25
<transcript>: What did I just do.

00:42:29
<transcript>: I wanted to copy all that. Did I.

00:42:34
<transcript>: Normally copy out of this.

00:42:38
<transcript>: There it goes. Okay.

00:42:41
<transcript>: So let's do.

00:42:57
<transcript>: Okay. Okay. We should be able to figure it out now, based on these categories, I don't know why.

00:43:05
<transcript>: The CloudFront color is purple. It doesn't make any sense. Cloud front is in networking and content delivery category which is purple.

00:43:08
<transcript>: So networking and content delivery is purple.

00:43:13
<transcript>: In the future everyone will be an AWS service for 15 minutes.

00:43:21
codespent: My jetbrains license is expiring, and really finding it too limited with M1 incompatibilities to renew. What do you all think is the best introductory to vim/neovim so I can see if it's right for me?

00:43:23
<transcript>: In the Asset package here when you download it has a Dura called Architecture Service Icons, which has 26 subdirectories, which seems to imply 26 categories.

00:43:24
samjandwich: (but also has all svg icons with the gradients included)

00:43:28
<transcript>: That's not good. There's 26 directories.

00:43:33
<transcript>: It says also has all SG icons with the Gradients included.

00:43:41
<transcript>: Yeah, same June. Which that's where I got this. That's where I got these. All these icons.

00:43:44
<transcript>: So, API, gateway.

00:43:44
<transcript>: app

00:43:47
<transcript>: App Flow Cloud Watch EventBridge.

00:43:51
<transcript>: I think. What is this? Oh, that's my preview. Okay.

00:43:54
<transcript>: Let's just do this. Let's turn off your Bivers.

00:43:54
<transcript>: so

00:43:56
<transcript>: So cloud watch.

00:43:56
samjandwich: Ahh, joined after that

00:44:00
<transcript>: Here. Is that color.

00:44:04
<transcript>: Wait a minute. Okay. So that's what API gateway.

00:44:04
<transcript>: an

00:44:07
<transcript>: An app flow. What category would that be.

00:44:10
<transcript>: Api, gateway.

00:44:18
<transcript>: What would API gateway.

00:44:23
<transcript>: That would be networking and content later. No.

00:44:23
<transcript>: what would that

00:44:27
<transcript>: What would that be? What categories? Ape Gateway in Stroop is here.

00:44:27
<transcript>: stroop

00:44:30
<transcript>: Stroop. With the four months.

00:44:36
<transcript>: Thank you so much. Troop. Oh, yeah. No worries. Indian. Which.

00:44:36
<transcript>: four

00:44:37
<transcript>: Four months.

00:44:41
<transcript>: Really appreciate it. Shrup.

00:44:41
<transcript>: you've been here

00:44:43
<transcript>: You've been here since the beginning.

00:44:47
<transcript>: Beginning of it all four months ago.

00:44:50
<transcript>: I don't know what category.

00:44:54
<transcript>: Of these names of categories.

00:44:54
<transcript>: what

00:44:54
stroopwafel26: The OG sub

00:44:59
<transcript>: What would API get way fit in like same as absent I know what color it is.

00:45:14
<transcript>: Like API Gateway is going to be this pink color. I don't understand which of these categories outfit in is it supposed to be networking and content delivery? Would that be API Gateway? Oh, let's just see. I can click on these. Right.

00:45:21
<transcript>: Who knew this is gonna be so confusing and hard? Yeah, ape gateway. Okay, cloud front. So clapfront should believe in that as well.

00:45:21
<transcript>: but for

00:45:24
<transcript>: But for some reason cloudfronts is purple.

00:45:26
<transcript>: I don't know why.

00:45:26
<transcript>: what

00:45:29
<transcript>: What's the Purple category.

00:45:29
<transcript>: cloud

00:45:33
<transcript>: Cloud Search is the Purple category.

00:45:37
<transcript>: More Services in the Purple category.

00:45:44
<transcript>: Emr. It's like the Analytics category.

00:45:44
<transcript>: it's purple

00:45:47
<transcript>: It's purple? Why is CloudFront? Purple? Purple.

00:45:47
<transcript>: does it make any sense

00:45:49
<transcript>: Does it make any sense.

00:45:52
<transcript>: Cloud Search Cloud front.

00:45:58
<transcript>: Seen it? Yeah, that's the Analytics category. Okay, so that's fine.

00:45:58
<transcript>: we're getting

00:46:02
<transcript>: We're getting a grass now on what colors mean, what so.

00:46:02
<transcript>: let's see

00:46:07
<transcript>: Let's see. Networking. Analytics. So networking, I said, was four, two.

00:46:14
<transcript>: This one that's not networking. Networking is.

00:46:21
<transcript>: I can delete the Twin Maker networking good to know, though, that Twin maker.

00:46:25
<transcript>: Has the lowercase in the SUG. That's weird.

00:46:32
<transcript>: Stroop. Was the original sub.

00:46:32
<transcript>: the first

00:46:33
<transcript>: The first.

00:46:38
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:46:44
<transcript>: So code guru that's the Ml category, auto scaling.

00:46:46
<transcript>: Pod, watches Vint bridge.

00:46:46
<transcript>: which one of these is

00:46:54
<transcript>: Which one of these is networking? It's like networking in something. So it's a little more content delivery. Yeah. So that is the API Gateway one. Okay.

00:46:54
<transcript>: okay

00:46:58
<transcript>: Okay, we're getting there. This one is going to be.

00:46:58
<transcript>: b

00:47:01
<transcript>: B eight, 4D.

00:47:04
<transcript>: It's not gonna make more sense to you in a bit, I think.

00:47:04
<transcript>: ff

00:47:06
codespent: Networking & Tacos is what you're looking for.

00:47:08
<transcript>: Ff Four It all makes perfect sense in my brain right now.

00:47:08
<transcript>: but i

00:47:13
<transcript>: But I have not communicated very well. Analytics is going to be the scene.

00:47:13
<transcript>: that's gonna

00:47:13
codespent: If it wasn't, it should be

00:47:17
<transcript>: That's gonna be for the two, seven, eight.

00:47:20
stroopwafel26: but only on taco tuesday

00:47:23
<transcript>: And it goes to a one, six, six FF. Okay.

00:47:26
<transcript>: Best analyst.

00:47:28
<transcript>: Next we need to do machine learning.

00:47:31
<transcript>: Machine.

00:47:33
<transcript>: Learning.

00:47:36
<transcript>: I think I want to do it that way.

00:47:37
codespent: And Taco Twendesday and Taco Thursday

00:47:48
<transcript>: That machine learning.

00:47:50
<transcript>: Is going to be.

00:47:52
sinamobasheri: hey man what's up

00:47:54
<transcript>: There we go.

00:47:54
<transcript>: that's

00:47:56
<transcript>: That's the let's see.

00:47:59
<transcript>: Where is it.

00:48:04
<transcript>: Coreto Dr DB. Those are database.

00:48:04
<transcript>: augment here

00:48:08
<transcript>: Augment. Here we go. App Stream Yeah, yeah, it's this 10. Oh.

00:48:10
<transcript>: Zero.

00:48:10
<transcript>: five

00:48:11
sinamobasheri: heard you had a new born the other day

00:48:13
<transcript>: Five, Five, F.

00:48:13
<transcript>: for

00:48:15
<transcript>: For e.

00:48:18
<transcript>: Goes to five, six.

00:48:21
sinamobasheri: congratulations

00:48:21
<transcript>: C seven. Okay.

00:48:30
sinamobasheri: best of luck

00:48:31
<transcript>: What's up, Cena.

00:48:35
lvl80dev: @CodeSpent check this https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/vim

00:48:38
<transcript>: I heard you had a new born the other day. Congratulations. Best of luck. Wait a minute. What? Me were you trying to somebody else.

00:48:44
<transcript>: Networking. And Tacos is what you're looking for. It wasn't it should be.

00:48:44
<transcript>: only a tire

00:48:45
<transcript>: Only a tire on Tuesday.

00:48:45
<transcript>: who hadn't

00:48:47
<transcript>: Who hadn't a newborn.

00:48:47
<transcript>: but

00:48:48
<transcript>: But.

00:48:49
daglee: Teej had a new born.

00:48:52
daglee: Not adam

00:48:54
<transcript>: Otige is teacher.

00:48:57
<transcript>: What.

00:49:00
<transcript>: No teachers in here, right now.

00:49:02
<transcript>: Check this out.

00:49:02
<transcript>: love a lady

00:49:05
<transcript>: Love a Lady Dev oh, you guys are talking, you're talking.

00:49:05
<transcript>: continue

00:49:07
<transcript>: Continue to mingle.

00:49:07
<transcript>: thank you for the follow

00:49:07
stroopwafel26: Maybe Adam forgot about his baby somehow

00:49:11
<transcript>: Thank you for the follows SAMHSA, Slark and techno.

00:49:14
<transcript>: I forgot about my baby oh, no.

00:49:16
<transcript>: That would be bad.

00:49:16
<transcript>: maybe

00:49:18
<transcript>: Maybe some next level forgetfulness.

00:49:18
<transcript>: okay

00:49:21
codespent: @lvl80dev gonna run that over my coffee, much appreciated!

00:49:24
<transcript>: Okay, so we've got machine learning. Next up is the last one, which is a security.

00:49:26
<transcript>: Security, security.

00:49:28
<transcript>: And that's gonna be.

00:49:29
sinamobasheri: !

00:49:33
stroopwafel26: j/k babies don't let you forget

00:49:35
<transcript>: Which one's? These. They already have the BD. I don't have that one, but that doesn't seem right.

00:49:35
<transcript>: bd zero

00:49:39
<transcript>: Bd. Zero. This one chime. Really.

00:49:47
daglee: Isn't that what baby brain does?

00:49:55
daglee: You forget everything.

00:49:58
<transcript>: Shine has to get yeah, it's red. Okay. I don't know why that's in the Rain family, but whatever we're not really using, all we're doing is using it for the visual purposes. So it's BD 0816. I thought about like trying to make sure there's always two answers in the same category, but.

00:49:58
<transcript>: that's

00:50:06
<transcript>: That's the only other reason I would use the categories F two, F, two or 5252. Okay, did I use them all.

00:50:06
<transcript>: one two three

00:50:09
<transcript>: 123-4567.

00:50:13
<transcript>: And they all have separate colors. Yes.

00:50:14
madlep: @CodeSpent There's `:Tutor` built in to neovim, which is ok for basics. Main learning is figuring out plugins etc that you want/need. Best advice is to start simple, then gradually add things and learn how to use them as need arises rather than going big to start with.

00:50:16
<transcript>: Cool. Okay. These are our categories.

00:50:16
<transcript>: feels good

00:50:17
<transcript>: Feels good.

00:50:21
<transcript>: What can we do with this now? We can see.

00:50:35
<transcript>: Okay. Up here what I'm gonna do. So now I'm calculating for every service.

00:50:35
<transcript>: what i

00:50:37
<transcript>: What I want to do is I want to.

00:50:41
<transcript>: What is what did this thing do before it outputted the hash.

00:50:48
stroopwafel26: just went out with my kid and gave her apple juice, obviously the apple juice went all over her jacket and pants, rookie mistake on my part

00:50:54
<transcript>: I think what I want to do, I might just actually just copy this.

00:51:02
<transcript>: And let's go into the create resources. This is where I like encode. Yeah.

00:51:09
<transcript>: Blow my nose at some point. Apparently I have a sniffling O's.

00:51:14
<transcript>: Categories. Okay. So I'm gonna use that in here when I create these resources.

00:51:17
<transcript>: So export.

00:51:27
<transcript>: Okay. That's fine.

00:51:31
codespent: Yeah I at least listed out the features I use day to day so will need to scout plugins. Navigation is the part that intimidates lol.

00:51:31
<transcript>: I'm not gonna have to do all that anymore. I'm not creating a Sprite anymore.

00:51:35
<transcript>: So it's just.

00:51:43
<transcript>: About.

00:51:46
<transcript>: So we write the resources.

00:51:54
<transcript>: Okay. I'm gonna need to do what I was doing in this previous file over here.

00:51:57
<transcript>: I was calculating.

00:51:57
<transcript>: the

00:51:59
<transcript>: The contents.

00:52:01
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:52:05
<transcript>: All this code. I need this.

00:52:13
<transcript>: I need to paste it in here.

00:52:18
<transcript>: Okay.

00:52:18
<transcript>: i guess

00:52:20
<transcript>: I guess this needs to be asynchronous.

00:52:27
<transcript>: What's it upset about? Wait. Has no effect on read file. Oh.

00:52:30
<transcript>: Fs has already used.

00:52:33
<transcript>: We want this to be promises.

00:52:38
<transcript>: That's gonna break some stuff. We'll fix it now that's await that. Yep.

00:52:43
<transcript>: We parse it. I gotta grab the.

00:52:47
<transcript>: This.

00:52:55
<transcript>: Encode images. Create resource. Here we go.

00:52:55
<transcript>: okay

00:52:57
<transcript>: Okay.

00:52:57
<transcript>: parse from sv

00:52:59
<transcript>: Parse. From SVD parser.

00:52:59
<transcript>: and then we got

00:53:02
<transcript>: And then we got the stock colors. Thank you so much for the follow. Pea, pasta.

00:53:04
<transcript>: Pasta.

00:53:10
<transcript>: Let's see. We got stop, one color, stop, two colors. That's how we're gonna figure out our category.

00:53:14
<transcript>: Right. Yeah. So I should maybe reversed.

00:53:21
<transcript>: I'm gonna reverse these so that the map is like colors. Leads to a category key.

00:53:21
<transcript>: okay

00:53:26
<transcript>: Okay, stop. Color. Stop. One stop to.

00:53:31
<transcript>: Down here I need to go and fix I've got right file things so that's fine.

00:53:31
<transcript>: okay

00:53:32
<transcript>: Okay.

00:53:39
<transcript>: Let's do this. Let's just rework this map. Now it's gonna be like.

00:53:40
<transcript>: It's gonna be like.

00:53:44
<transcript>: That looks yank everything inside.

00:53:47
<transcript>: That endless.

00:53:47
<transcript>: do

00:53:49
<transcript>: Do like this.

00:53:53
<transcript>: Just back to back them, you know.

00:53:55
<transcript>: Like that.

00:53:59
<transcript>: And then we'll say that is computer.

00:54:07
<transcript>: The same thing here.

00:54:07
<transcript>: so we

00:54:09
<transcript>: So we're gonna.

00:54:12
<transcript>: Yank in the bracket.

00:54:16
<transcript>: Paste that.

00:54:20
<transcript>: And then.

00:54:21
<transcript>: Storage.

00:54:30
<transcript>: And then yank in the brackets.

00:54:33
<transcript>: Paste.

00:54:37
<transcript>: Database.

00:54:50
<transcript>: Networking.

00:54:56
<transcript>: Yank in there.

00:55:03
<transcript>: Analytics.

00:55:05
<transcript>: We're getting there.

00:55:20
recyclepoopandeatit: tp{ascalCase method is very novice approach

00:55:20
<transcript>: We go.

00:55:23
<transcript>: A Sheen learning.

00:55:28
<transcript>: And then lastly, we got security.

00:55:41
<transcript>: There's our map. And down here we can just say.

00:55:46
<transcript>: Comps. Category equals categories.

00:55:52
<transcript>: And then we're gonna do Stop, one color.

00:55:56
<transcript>: Let's do like this.

00:55:56
<transcript>: thank you

00:56:00
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow. Mr. Say.

00:56:07
<transcript>: Tp? Pasco case? What do you guys talking about? Thanks for the follow rid.

00:56:07
<transcript>: so this

00:56:10
<transcript>: So this is gonna be like, Stop, one.

00:56:10
<transcript>: color

00:56:12
<transcript>: Color.

00:56:14
<transcript>: And then.

00:56:17
<transcript>: We'll.

00:56:20
<transcript>: Like this. Stop. Two color.

00:56:23
<transcript>: And then the whole thing.

00:56:23
<transcript>: uppercase

00:56:24
<transcript>: Uppercase.

00:56:29
<transcript>: That's our category, because we have that one service that had a lowercase.

00:56:29
<transcript>: things

00:56:33
<transcript>: Things. I thought. Gandalf, gandhf swallowing me.

00:56:38
riad_dzz: impressive bio you get there, gl

00:56:39
<transcript>: Huge, huge fan, huge fan, Ganoff.

00:56:45
<transcript>: Ganoffressive bio.

00:56:48
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Riad. Oh.

00:56:51
<transcript>: My voice, my voice might be going.

00:56:52
gandalf_of: tanks

00:56:57
<transcript>: What was in my bio.

00:56:57
<transcript>: the impressed

00:57:02
<transcript>: The Impressed Reed Gandh? Welcome to Chat, welcome, welcome.

00:57:04
<transcript>: Okay.

00:57:09
<transcript>: So that's our category. We're gonna add the category here.

00:57:10
sockenguy: I am currently writing / updating our e2e test, so fcking annoying uhh

00:57:18
<transcript>: We have formatted category, and then the image.

00:57:21
<transcript>: And the prefix.

00:57:21
<transcript>: oh

00:57:26
<transcript>: Oh, we were something else we need to do? We actually need to extract.

00:57:26
<transcript>: i want to get

00:57:28
<transcript>: I want to get the path.

00:57:28
<transcript>: so let's see

00:57:41
<transcript>: So let's see. Let's go back to this encode images. I was playing with this. So here's the parsed thing. I want to get the let's see. That's the gradient. And I grabbed the stop colors out of that. That's fine. But down here.

00:57:41
<transcript>: we've got

00:57:42
<transcript>: We've got.

00:57:50
rebeldecibel: what mjs stands for?

00:57:57
<transcript>: A background. We're gonna ignore this thing, right? So this is the background in the SVG. It just has to fill the points to that gradient. But then this one, this is the thing. Everything else. I guess every other child element.

00:57:57
<transcript>: so

00:58:05
<transcript>: So some of them might have multiple paths. We need to copy all of them. I guess I need to copy all paths and all properties. Oh, bummer.

00:58:09
<transcript>: I'm gonna turn that back into, like, SVG data.

00:58:16
<transcript>: I guess I could just assume I know that the fill is white on all of them. I know that think for the follow.

00:58:25
<transcript>: Red, rebelled or Rebel decibel. Did it. Nailed it. What? Mjs imports. An ESM file. An Esme module.

00:58:25
<transcript>: this is one of the packaging

00:58:29
<transcript>: This is one of the packaging like module systems in JavaScript.

00:58:29
<transcript>: i'm

00:58:37
<transcript>: I'm currently we're writing updating our Indian test. So annoying. That does sound annoying. Stocking guy sounds very annoying.

00:58:37
<transcript>: so

00:58:41
<transcript>: So if I just grab the D's, just the bees, you know.

00:58:41
<transcript>: just these

00:58:50
<transcript>: Just these bees. I think I can string together. I can put the SUG back together again, like Humpty dumpy. So how do I find those? Next question.

00:58:50
<transcript>: so this

00:58:55
<transcript>: So this is the second element adjacent to.

00:58:58
<transcript>: The definitions.

00:58:58
<transcript>: this

00:59:04
<transcript>: This was the definitions. And then I think the next element will always be you.

00:59:07
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:59:07
<transcript>: the ele

00:59:11
<transcript>: The element. You know, I'm saying, a G.

00:59:11
<transcript>: i'm assuming there

00:59:16
<transcript>: I'm assuming there's only everyone. All the lines are always white. Okay. Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.

00:59:26
<transcript>: So let's go back here and let's say we have SVG. I figured out that the children the first child. The first child of her child.

00:59:28
<transcript>: The children.

00:59:28
<transcript>: that

00:59:30
<transcript>: That's a lot of navigating.

00:59:39
<transcript>: Just relying on the fact that these suds all follow like an exact pattern and the script will blow up if I'm wrong, like, let's actually go back to.

00:59:39
<transcript>: this sc

00:59:42
<transcript>: This script. And let's try and figure this out from here.

00:59:42
<transcript>: so

00:59:47
<transcript>: So stop one color. So now I want to find constg.

00:59:47
<transcript>: s

00:59:49
<transcript>: Svg.

00:59:49
<transcript>: children

00:59:50
<transcript>: Children.

00:59:55
<transcript>: One. Okay.

00:59:57
<transcript>: Let's look.

01:00:04
<transcript>: Okay.

01:00:07
<transcript>: Sorry. I want to do it over here.

01:00:15
<transcript>: Not found? Can I find module and code images? Because I put two slashes on the end because I'm done oh under five.

01:00:15
<transcript>: okay

01:00:18
<transcript>: Okay. That wasn't it.

01:00:26
<transcript>: Nope. Didn't wonder that when to do that. Okay. So that was not it SUG children.

01:00:29
<transcript>: Children, zero.

01:00:34
<transcript>: So let's see. Gg is the top level. Let's see.

01:00:34
<transcript>: the

01:00:40
<transcript>: The first children we take the first one is the SUG. And then that has children.

01:00:40
<transcript>: the first

01:00:42
rebeldecibel: damn dude, your brain must be working in very unique way if you find it easily nafigate in this font :D

01:00:43
<transcript>: The first one of those children is the death.

01:00:43
<transcript>: and the second

01:00:46
<transcript>: And the second one is an element G.

01:00:46
<transcript>: right

01:00:47
<transcript>: Right.

01:00:47
<transcript>: so

01:00:51
<transcript>: So here. Oh, so it's just right here. It's right here.

01:00:53
rebeldecibel: navigate*

01:00:55
<transcript>: Just.

01:00:59
<transcript>: Delete the end. Okay. So that should be right.

01:01:04
<transcript>: That should be it. Yeah. Okay.

01:01:04
<transcript>: path and it has

01:01:05
<transcript>: Path. And it has.

01:01:05
<transcript>: oh some of

01:01:08
<transcript>: Oh, some of them do have multiple children. That's fine.

01:01:13
<transcript>: We'll do some we'll do some verifying.

01:01:16
<transcript>: Okay. So the G.

01:01:20
<transcript>: Has what in it. It has children.

01:01:20
<transcript>: this first child

01:01:34
<transcript>: This first child is always just the background. We don't care about it. We only care about subsequent children. Any future children. After the background, our pads that I care about. So the way I'm gonna do that is I'm gonna say.

01:01:37
<transcript>: Comps. Pads actually.

01:01:42
<transcript>: Like this has equals G no.

01:01:42
<transcript>: d

01:01:43
<transcript>: D.

01:01:43
<transcript>: children

01:01:45
<transcript>: Children.

01:01:45
<transcript>: okay

01:01:46
<transcript>: Okay.

01:01:49
<transcript>: As.

01:01:51
<transcript>: Right.

01:02:04
<transcript>: Following. Yeah, wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh, I still need to grab the property out of it. It's like the D property. We got to grab the D's. That's all. We're only interested in the DS.

01:02:04
<transcript>: as

01:02:06
<transcript>: As.

01:02:06
<transcript>: let's see

01:02:07
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:02:17
<transcript>: Map.

01:02:17
<transcript>: and we just

01:02:20
<transcript>: And we just want the properties.

01:02:20
<transcript>: is that what it was

01:02:22
<transcript>: Is that what it was.

01:02:23
daglee: Grab the deez? Nutz!

01:02:26
<transcript>: Properties.

01:02:30
<transcript>: Property.

01:02:33
<transcript>: Like that.

01:02:35
<transcript>: And we're gonna just.

01:02:35
<transcript>: make sure

01:02:37
<transcript>: Make sure.

01:02:37
<transcript>: that

01:02:47
<transcript>: That they all have the DS, and that should be that could be multiple, right? It could be an array. There could be more than one item in it. We're gonna check if there are any like that.

01:02:52
<transcript>: Grab the DS.

01:03:09
<transcript>: My brain must be working in a very unique way. If you find it easily. Navigating the font. I've just gotten used to it. I gotten used to the operator mono life. Okay, so let's see if any element has multiple pads. I think they're going to I don't know how.

01:03:09
<transcript>: it's possible

01:03:12
<transcript>: It's possible to make all of the service icons.

01:03:14
<transcript>: Without.

01:03:14
<transcript>: so

01:03:17
<transcript>: So let's see if.

01:03:18
<transcript>: These.

01:03:18
<transcript>: that link

01:03:21
<transcript>: That links is greater than one.

01:03:25
<transcript>: Then we're going to log it.

01:03:25
<transcript>: okay

01:03:27
<transcript>: Okay only log those.

01:03:33
<transcript>: None. They all just have one path. This is so easy.

01:03:33
<transcript>: so

01:03:36
<transcript>: So easy too easy one might say.

01:03:36
<transcript>: too easy

01:03:41
<transcript>: Too easy. I know nobody watching this has any idea what I'm trying to do, and I'm fine with that.

01:03:43
<transcript>: You'll know soon enough.

01:03:43
<transcript>: yank

01:03:45
<transcript>: Yank all that code.

01:03:51
<transcript>: Let's go back to our create resources. We're gonna paste all that code, okay.

01:03:51
<transcript>: so now

01:03:55
<transcript>: So now we have the D's, and we're going to encode those.

01:03:58
<transcript>: We're gonna encode those into.

01:03:58
<transcript>: so these are

01:04:01
<transcript>: So these are always just one.

01:04:01
<transcript>: it's

01:04:03
<transcript>: It's always just one.

01:04:21
<transcript>: So it's just gonna be D. The D. Each one of them has a D, and it has a category. That's what I've extracted from the suds. And now I can avoid. I'm never gonna use this. I'm gonna leave it in there, but I'm never gonna use these, like, hash, hash and original. I'm not gonna be consuming those. I don't need them.

01:04:21
<transcript>: i just need

01:04:22
<transcript>: I just need this.

01:04:22
<transcript>: d

01:04:26
<transcript>: D, and I want to name it something else.

01:04:26
<transcript>: oh i want

01:04:37
<transcript>: Oh, I want to encode it. I want to encode it. Do I want to encode it? Do I need to encode it? Why encode it? It might be more succinct.

01:04:42
<transcript>: This basic for encoding actually like make it smaller such a dumb question.

01:04:47
<transcript>: Does anyone know what I'm trying to say? If I base 64 encode.

01:04:47
<transcript>: this

01:04:48
<transcript>: This.

01:04:48
<transcript>: path

01:04:52
<transcript>: Path string. Well, that actually compressed it in any way or no.

01:04:57
woofwoofdude: no bas64 doesn't compress

01:04:57
<transcript>: How don't think it does.

01:05:01
madlep: Don't think so

01:05:02
<transcript>: It'll just remove all the spaces and stuff.

01:05:08
<transcript>: Doesn't compress. Thank for the fire. Thank you for joining Chat. Wolf. Welcome to Chat. I mean.

01:05:14
woofwoofdude: if anything it's worse

01:05:15
<transcript>: So then we could just put the D straight on it. Let's just put the D on it. Okay. And then we ride it.

01:05:15
<transcript>: now i need

01:05:17
<transcript>: Now I need to.

01:05:21
<transcript>: Let's just run this script.

01:05:21
rebeldecibel: with JS I guess you never can know for sure :D

01:05:25
<transcript>: Instead of encode images, it's create.

01:05:25
<transcript>: resources

01:05:27
<transcript>: Resources.

01:05:34
<transcript>: Okay, so the promises does I have reader sink.

01:05:38
<transcript>: That's fine.

01:05:43
<transcript>: Where is It? Reader.

01:05:49
<transcript>: So FS, this is just gonna be.

01:05:54
<transcript>: Read birth, and we're gonna have to await it.

01:05:58
<transcript>: All that just changed.

01:06:02
<transcript>: Oh, but I'm gonna have to.

01:06:07
<transcript>: Exporting these.

01:06:07
<transcript>: cons

01:06:08
<transcript>: Cons.

01:06:08
<transcript>: files

01:06:09
<transcript>: Files.

01:06:15
<transcript>: Equals the Weight File System reader.

01:06:20
<transcript>: Public Images original.

01:06:23
<transcript>: And then I can just do.

01:06:31
<transcript>: Right files.

01:06:31
<transcript>: think of the

01:06:33
<transcript>: Think of the follow before.

01:06:36
<transcript>: With this I guess you can never know for sure.

01:06:39
<transcript>: Okay.

01:06:44
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow Yanni.

01:06:44
<transcript>: so

01:06:46
<transcript>: So is this good.

01:06:46
<transcript>: is this good

01:06:52
<transcript>: Is this good? I don't know why I'm exporting this. I never import these. This is just a script. I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna do it.

01:06:54
<transcript>: Just confusing.

01:06:54
<transcript>: okay

01:07:00
<transcript>: Okay. So we've got all that stuff and we stringify. Let's do it.

01:07:00
<transcript>: let's do it

01:07:06
madlep: `echo 'Hello, world!' | wc -c` 14  `echo 'Hello, world!' | base64 | wc -c` 21

01:07:10
<transcript>: Let's do it. Nope. Let's not write file sync. Also, not a function because it's the promises thing. Why am I sit down? This is just right. File.

01:07:15
<transcript>: We'll await. It is to be.

01:07:16
woofwoofdude: need to promise.all those files since your map returns an array of promises

01:07:18
<transcript>: This to be correct.

01:07:23
<transcript>: What's wrong? Old Pass is not defined.

01:07:27
<transcript>: What old path.

01:07:29
<transcript>: Is not defined.

01:07:33
<transcript>: Where is Old Path, Old path.

01:07:36
<transcript>: It sure is not.

01:07:36
<transcript>: defin

01:07:39
<transcript>: Defined why.

01:07:43
<transcript>: Old path. Why are we doing that.

01:07:43
<transcript>: it's that old

01:07:45
<transcript>: It's that old path. It's just file name.

01:07:47
<transcript>: Right.

01:07:47
<transcript>: yeah

01:07:51
<transcript>: Yeah file name is the full path or no.

01:07:51
<transcript>: did not

01:07:55
<transcript>: Did not. It might not be. I don't know. Find out.

01:07:57
<transcript>: We'll find out.

01:07:57
<transcript>: right now

01:07:58
<transcript>: Right now.

01:08:03
<transcript>: Oh, no. Such file. Yeah, yeah, it doesn't have the full path.

01:08:03
<transcript>: oh

01:08:04
<transcript>: Oh.

01:08:04
<transcript>: what i just

01:08:06
<transcript>: What I just do.

01:08:12
<transcript>: Bunny.

01:08:14
<transcript>: Let's see file name.

01:08:25
<transcript>: Let's do path join.

01:08:27
<transcript>: Public.

01:08:27
<transcript>: images

01:08:30
<transcript>: Images original.

01:08:39
<transcript>: Are we getting there? It worked.

01:08:39
<transcript>: so

01:08:41
<transcript>: So uneventful.

01:08:49
<transcript>: Thank you to follow Levy Exe. Need to promise all those files since your map returns an array of promises. Oh, it does.

01:08:52
<transcript>: Is that right. So the something around here.

01:08:56
<transcript>: Saying this reader.

01:09:01
<transcript>: Saying that's not just that's just strange. I awaited that right.

01:09:04
<transcript>: Promise. All those files. Yeah. No. I awaited that.

01:09:04
<transcript>: are you

01:09:07
<transcript>: Are you saying this is a bunch of promises, resources.

01:09:07
<transcript>: oh

01:09:10
<transcript>: Oh? Oh? These? Yeah? Yeah? Okay.

01:09:10
<transcript>: wait

01:09:13
<transcript>: Wait. What.

01:09:16
<transcript>: I need to I need these are all promises.

01:09:20
<transcript>: Okay.

01:09:25
<transcript>: What did I do.

01:09:25
<transcript>: what did i

01:09:28
<transcript>: What did I change that made that happen.

01:09:32
<transcript>: Oh, because these are all async? Oh, we're mapping to ACET? Good call, good call.

01:09:32
<transcript>: so

01:09:34
<transcript>: So let's just.

01:09:34
<transcript>: do it

01:09:36
<transcript>: Do it like this promise.

01:09:51
<transcript>: Okay.

01:09:51
<transcript>: now we should be

01:09:53
<transcript>: Now we should be good. Right.

01:09:55
<transcript>: Okay.

01:09:57
woofwoofdude: yes, there you go :)

01:09:59
<transcript>: Let's open.

01:10:10
<transcript>: Where does that go? Data resources. Here we go. Okay, so now we have name is a category.

01:10:10
<transcript>: that's good

01:10:14
<transcript>: That's good. And then we have the D. Each of them has the D.

01:10:14
<transcript>: and then

01:10:19
<transcript>: And then an image and a prefix. Okay. So we have more to work with here. Now I can construct.

01:10:22
<transcript>: Let's first of all, I want to know.

01:10:25
<transcript>: Like how much.

01:10:30
<transcript>: Kb is this string. I'm done this before.

01:10:37
<transcript>: No, like, prime can probably just take a string and be like, in his head. You can just be like, oh, I got this.

01:10:37
<transcript>: six hundred

01:10:40
<transcript>: 646 bytes.

01:10:49
<transcript>: So if that's coming down and it won't even be all this, it'll be less than this. It'll be the image part will be in there.

01:10:57
<transcript>: So like, 447 bytes. That's not too much of a payload, right? For every question, every range of the game.

01:10:59
<transcript>: I don't think that's too much.

01:11:07
<transcript>: As opposed to having like a one Meg download up front to download all the SVGs. I feel like this is gonna be better.

01:11:07
<transcript>: this

01:11:11
<transcript>: This is going to be better people. It's better.

01:11:11
<transcript>: okay let's

01:11:16
<transcript>: Okay, let's let's build it now. So now I have the data. I need to do this.

01:11:19
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:11:19
<transcript>: so first

01:11:23
<transcript>: So first thing I need to do, I want to strip out all the stuff I did yesterday.

01:11:28
<transcript>: I don't need all this stuff anymore. So SVG? Spriteloader.

01:11:28
<transcript>: pmp

01:11:32
<transcript>: Pmpm. Remove SVG, Sprite.

01:11:32
<transcript>: loader

01:11:34
<transcript>: Loader.

01:11:34
<transcript>: i don't need

01:11:35
<transcript>: I don't need it anymore.

01:11:35
<transcript>: this is a

01:11:37
<transcript>: This is a dumb IDs.

01:11:40
<transcript>: I got my own way.

01:11:40
<transcript>: and now i don't need

01:11:43
<transcript>: And now I don't need any of this.

01:11:48
<transcript>: No custom Web Pack Config Feels good.

01:11:54
<transcript>: What other things that I do yesterday that were done? I probably had to added more things.

01:11:54
<transcript>: let's see

01:12:00
<transcript>: Let's see the S. Lincoln Fig. Max. Sugar. That's a Deputy. I need that. Yeah. Okay.

01:12:00
<transcript>: so nothing in there

01:12:02
<transcript>: So nothing in there.

01:12:02
<transcript>: let's see

01:12:04
<transcript>: Let's see. Tailwind. Config. What are I doing here.

01:12:08
<transcript>: I just got rid of the Virgil Font. That's fine.

01:12:08
<transcript>: that's fine

01:12:09
<transcript>: That's fine.

01:12:14
<transcript>: Okay utils icon this goes away.

01:12:16
<transcript>: Get out of here.

01:12:20
<transcript>: This is probably no. Okay.

01:12:23
<transcript>: Let's see. What did I change.

01:12:23
<transcript>: in the gate i'll

01:12:27
<transcript>: In the gate. I'll check that in a second that's we're gonna work next.

01:12:27
<transcript>: api

01:12:34
<transcript>: Api routes. What index? I'll probably change a bunch of stuff in there. We'll get there. Encode images. Okay.

01:12:36
<transcript>: Public.

01:12:36
<transcript>: and then

01:12:38
<transcript>: And then, oh, my.

01:12:41
<transcript>: Is that it.

01:12:43
<transcript>: All that I changed.

01:12:43
<transcript>: we

01:12:49
<transcript>: We don't have the Sprite thing anymore. We're gonna change our page first. Let's go to our servers.

01:12:57
<transcript>: And let's let's fix this up. So every round now create round. Every round is going to do something different.

01:12:57
<transcript>: first of all

01:12:59
<transcript>: First of all, I need to.

01:12:59
<transcript>: so

01:13:02
<transcript>: So is resources type.

01:13:04
<transcript>: Let's just type correctly.

01:13:07
<transcript>: Like.

01:13:13
<transcript>: Yeah, it is cool.

01:13:13
<transcript>: name

01:13:17
<transcript>: Name Category Dmage prefix. So I just imported it from the JSON file.

01:13:19
<transcript>: And it worked.

01:13:26
<transcript>: So we have choices. We have an answer. Now instead of returning the image for the answer.

01:13:26
<transcript>: we're going to

01:13:31
<transcript>: We're going to return something different we're going to return.

01:13:38
<transcript>: The answer dot B. Oh, not all of them have a D. What.

01:13:41
<transcript>: They don't all have a category either.

01:13:43
<transcript>: How's that work.

01:13:52
<transcript>: Okay, we're not gonna return an image. We're gonna return.

01:13:55
<transcript>: Category.

01:13:57
<transcript>: Oh, I shouldn't.

01:13:57
<transcript>: say the category

01:13:59
<transcript>: Say the category name.

01:14:01
<transcript>: Colors.

01:14:01
<transcript>: i'll just

01:14:06
<transcript>: I'll just return the colors. Oh, I actually have to pee really bad. Okay, I'm gonna take a pea break.

01:14:06
<transcript>: and i'll

01:14:09
<transcript>: And I'll be back. Be right back.

01:14:13
woofwoofdude: alright, glhf gotta go too

01:14:18
papagebu: !pp

01:24:41
<transcript>: Lopez.

01:24:47
<transcript>: Alright. I know like I've been streaming for an hour and a half now and nobody has any idea what I'm doing.

01:24:54
<transcript>: I don't think you have any idea. Maybe you do, but I think it's gonna start making sense here pretty soon. Goodbye to it.

01:25:01
<transcript>: Alright.

01:25:04
<transcript>: Okay. So we're in. This is the backend.

01:25:09
<transcript>: What I want to return for the answer now is the category.

01:25:12
<transcript>: Category.

01:25:12
<transcript>: and

01:25:13
<transcript>: And.

01:25:13
<transcript>: the

01:25:14
<transcript>: The.

01:25:21
<transcript>: What.

01:25:25
<transcript>: So I need to define the category. It's.

01:25:25
<transcript>: cost

01:25:27
<transcript>: Cost category.

01:25:35
<transcript>: And then also the D.

01:25:40
<transcript>: We're going to do the D here is. Well.

01:25:42
<transcript>: And that's just path data.

01:25:42
<transcript>: for the

01:25:42
rebeldecibel: the streamer looks similar to one well known celeb (movie star) but I can't remember neither the name or the movie :D

01:25:44
<transcript>: For the SDG.

01:25:49
<transcript>: I don't know why some of them would be null, and I feel like I need to check that.

01:25:49
<transcript>: or why

01:25:52
<transcript>: Or why they'd be undefined. I guess.

01:25:58
<transcript>: I don't want to check that out. I guess I need to import this thing and print out all the D's.

01:26:02
<transcript>: Not print them out, but just if it's unfined.

01:26:03
cowfacedude99: an off topic, how much you think of SLA and SLO while building any application?

01:26:05
<transcript>: At the end of this file.

01:26:10
<transcript>: I would some of them not have a D or category.

01:26:10
<transcript>: oh like

01:26:14
<transcript>: Oh, like this one doesn't have a category. Whoa, Whoa.

01:26:19
<transcript>: Okay. So some don't have a D, some don't have a category. Let's figure that out.

01:26:21
<transcript>: That's important.

01:26:29
<transcript>: So here if.

01:26:29
<transcript>: not

01:26:31
<transcript>: Not the.

01:26:37
<transcript>: Console log. Let's log the whole SVD. Maybe.

01:26:41
<transcript>: Or just log the name of it.

01:26:43
official_brens: can someone help with python homework ? its basics but i dont understand it

01:26:43
lvl80dev: oh wait, you also have those green dots in your gutter

01:26:45
<transcript>: So the name.

01:26:47
<transcript>: Hyphenated name.

01:26:50
<transcript>: We'll just do file name.

01:26:50
<transcript>: and

01:26:53
<transcript>: And actually we will log.

01:26:53
<transcript>: the

01:26:53
<transcript>: The.

01:26:56
<transcript>: Log content.

01:27:01
<transcript>: And if there's not a D.

01:27:04
<transcript>: Or there's not a.

01:27:08
<transcript>: Not the or not.

01:27:08
<transcript>: category

01:27:10
<transcript>: Category.

01:27:13
<transcript>: Okay like that.

01:27:15
<transcript>: Now, let's run our script again.

01:27:17
lvl80dev: I've got them and it is really annoying

01:27:24
<transcript>: So we have we have some.

01:27:24
<transcript>: wavelengths

01:27:25
<transcript>: Wavelengths.

01:27:28
<transcript>: Sink Box xmesh.

01:27:32
<transcript>: Syncbox, Craig Hota.

01:27:32
<transcript>: sig box

01:27:33
cowfacedude99: @Official_Brens we can point you in the right direction but it is your homework LUL

01:27:37
<transcript>: Sig Box Stoke. There's a pattern here. It's the Think Box Services. Sequoia.

01:27:38
<transcript>: Deadline.

01:27:41
<transcript>: Frost.

01:27:54
<transcript>: Sam serverless application repository. Or that's not Sam, that's service application repository. So what is what is it about these that they don't have? Let's just look at the first one here. Oh, there's a bunch of them.

01:27:57
<transcript>: There's a bunch of them.

01:28:05
<transcript>: What is it about these? How many of them are there.

01:28:08
<transcript>: Oh, wow. Okay.

01:28:11
<transcript>: First one is bracket.

01:28:15
<transcript>: And let's look at it. We've got defs linear gradient.

01:28:18
rebeldecibel: maybe place NOT and NOT?

01:28:18
<transcript>: It has a color that.

01:28:18
<transcript>: to

01:28:20
<transcript>: To.

01:28:20
<transcript>: if nine zero

01:28:22
<transcript>: If 90 ahaha.

01:28:22
<transcript>: it's

01:28:24
<transcript>: It's this.

01:28:28
<transcript>: It's. This. What's going on here? Can someone.

01:28:34
<transcript>: Streamer look similar to one wellknown celeb a movie star but can't think.

01:28:37
<transcript>: The name or the movie, but.

01:28:37
<transcript>: i don't know

01:28:43
<transcript>: I don't know. I've not heard that a lot. I've heard some people say I look like Mr. Beast. I've heard.

01:28:43
<transcript>: what have i heard

01:28:50
<transcript>: What have I heard? I don't know. I've heard some things, but I've never heard movie star. That's a new one for me off topic. How much do you think.

01:28:50
<transcript>: sl

01:28:53
<transcript>: Sla and Slo while building any application.

01:28:56
<transcript>: Not much.

01:29:01
<transcript>: I mean I'm mostly building.

01:29:01
<transcript>: services

01:29:02
<transcript>: Services.

01:29:02
<transcript>: so

01:29:04
<transcript>: So.

01:29:09
<transcript>: And like I guess I would think about an SLA more if I were like building.

01:29:11
<transcript>: An API.

01:29:14
<transcript>: Product and I'd really love to build an API product.

01:29:24
<transcript>: Only for an app or something. I don't know. I don't think about it at all. I guess. Welcome to Chat Essential Brins. Can someone help with Python homework? It's basics, but I don't understand it.

01:29:24
<transcript>: do you have

01:29:32
<transcript>: Do you have those green dots in your gutter? What has those green dots in your gutter? I've got them. And it's really annoying. What.

01:29:34
<transcript>: Our green dots in my gutter.

01:29:37
<transcript>: Green dots.

01:29:37
<transcript>: in my gu

01:29:37
lvl80dev: they were instead of gitsigns like 10 minutes ago. I'm getting them also

01:29:39
<transcript>: In my gutter.

01:29:42
<transcript>: Like in my in Vimv.

01:29:45
lvl80dev: not right now

01:29:46
lvl80dev: yes

01:29:47
<transcript>: I don't see the green dots. Maybe they were on a different view.

01:29:50
<transcript>: It is your homework.

01:29:53
<transcript>: Maybe place not and not.

01:29:57
<transcript>: They were instead of get signs, like ten minutes ago. Okay.

01:29:57
<transcript>: yeah

01:30:01
<transcript>: Yeah? We'll see if they show back up and I'll be paying attention.

01:30:06
<transcript>: Okay. So this the problem is some of these.

01:30:08
<transcript>: Have the.

01:30:08
<transcript>: f

01:30:18
rebeldecibel: !d && !category

01:30:24
<transcript>: F 90 shortcut. Ff 9090 zero. Is that the other? Is that the only issue? So if they don't have a category, they still have a D, though I bet most of these just don't have a D. Okay, so let's do this. Let's do this.

01:30:24
<transcript>: let's say

01:30:26
<transcript>: Let's say Just D first.

01:30:30
<transcript>: Just these.

01:30:34
<transcript>: So I can figure out.

01:30:39
<transcript>: Okay. So there's only one that doesn't have a D, and that's twin maker.

01:30:41
generalconcativty: Give them the D!

01:30:42
<transcript>: Twin maker? What does it have.

01:30:42
<transcript>: linear gradient

01:30:43
cowfacedude99: there's a whole section on SLA and SLO and I am thinking of skipping it LUL

01:30:45
<transcript>: Linear gradient, and then.

01:30:48
<transcript>: Data name so paths.

01:30:48
<transcript>: the

01:30:50
<transcript>: The.

01:30:50
<transcript>: what

01:30:53
<transcript>: What fill URL. And then this is the D.

01:30:53
<transcript>: why is that

01:30:55
<transcript>: Why is that not.

01:31:02
<transcript>: Why is that not parsed? It does have this weird data name. This thing.

01:31:02
<transcript>: i don't i

01:31:07
<transcript>: I don't. I haven't seen that into the other ones. Did that break my parts somehow.

01:31:13
<transcript>: Let's just if it doesn't have a D. Let's just.

01:31:15
<transcript>: Do something else. Let's print.

01:31:19
<transcript>: This console log.

01:31:21
<transcript>: Let's Sue G.

01:31:28
<transcript>: We're gonna figure out this D first, because I think this is the easier of them.

01:31:33
<transcript>: Children. Okay, so that's not the right D.

01:31:35
<transcript>: Or G. I mean.

01:31:35
<transcript>: that is the

01:31:37
<transcript>: That is the fill.

01:31:37
<transcript>: okay

01:31:39
<transcript>: Okay. So Let's.

01:31:39
<transcript>: print

01:31:41
<transcript>: Print.

01:31:45
<transcript>: Let's print the.

01:31:50
<transcript>: Svg, children.

01:31:57
<transcript>: Has an empty desk.

01:32:04
<transcript>: Wait, no, no. The children are in there. So there's the deaths. And it has this path.

01:32:08
<transcript>: And then it's a separate it's a separate child.

01:32:12
<transcript>: Wait. What.

01:32:14
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm assuming.

01:32:14
rebeldecibel: you seem like a cool streamer but man, I just can't look at the JS :D good luck with your project :)

01:32:19
<transcript>: What am I assuming here all the rest of them operating in such a way.

01:32:26
blakegreendev: Hey Adam, what kind of headphones do you use? I'm in the market for some over the ear headphones

01:32:27
<transcript>: That you have the deaths so SDG these are the color style.

01:32:31
<transcript>: I feel like I should add.

01:32:33
<transcript>: Const.

01:32:37
<transcript>: constildren

01:32:37
<transcript>: Constildren.

01:32:37
<transcript>: so that's

01:32:42
<transcript>: So that's this and then the rest of them.

01:32:47
<transcript>: See like this.

01:32:51
<transcript>: Have.

01:32:54
<transcript>: Right.

01:32:57
<transcript>: Now, wait.

01:33:00
<transcript>: Children.

01:33:07
<transcript>: I don't want to. I don't want to break the other. I could break the other usage.

01:33:07
<transcript>: you about

01:33:09
<transcript>: You about this.

01:33:14
<transcript>: So Children, zero.

01:33:14
<transcript>: the first

01:33:16
<transcript>: The first child. The first child.

01:33:16
<transcript>: and then

01:33:18
<transcript>: And then the two colors.

01:33:29
<transcript>: The first child of the first child. That's the. Yeah, death is the first child. Right. So if I do this constant S equals.

01:33:32
<transcript>: Svd, children.

01:33:35
<transcript>: And I can replace this.

01:33:40
<transcript>: No.

01:33:49
<transcript>: And then okay. So then the children, the first child of death.

01:33:49
<transcript>: is

01:33:52
<transcript>: Is the linear gradient.

01:33:54
<transcript>: Ops Group gradient.

01:33:56
<transcript>: Gradient.

01:33:56
<transcript>: equals

01:33:58
<transcript>: Equals def.

01:34:01
<transcript>: Children.

01:34:04
<transcript>: That's the Great Ant.

01:34:07
<transcript>: So I can go.

01:34:11
<transcript>: Gradient.

01:34:15
<transcript>: At Stop once up to.

01:34:23
<transcript>: But then down here we say the second child of the SVG should be.

01:34:23
<transcript>: the g

01:34:24
<transcript>: The G.

01:34:24
<transcript>: but in this

01:34:29
<transcript>: But in this in this case we have two children.

01:34:29
<transcript>: after

01:34:30
<transcript>: After.

01:34:30
<transcript>: death

01:34:31
<transcript>: Death.

01:34:31
<transcript>: and that's my

01:34:35
<transcript>: And that's my problem. I need to ignore this one.

01:34:38
<transcript>: So we'll do this. We'll say.

01:34:41
<transcript>: Paths, GChildren.

01:34:44
<transcript>: If.

01:34:47
<transcript>: The this shot.

01:34:51
<transcript>: Doesn't have any children. Skip it.

01:34:54
<transcript>: Right.

01:35:02
<transcript>: That's what happens. We have a one that doesn't have any. No, no. It wouldn't have any property. It wouldn't have any.

01:35:07
<transcript>: Skipping.

01:35:09
<transcript>: Yeah, we already.

01:35:13
<transcript>: Skip this first child, and then we go to paths.

01:35:24
<transcript>: This was just struck so differently. Twin Maker is just structured differently. This SUG is not like the others.

01:35:27
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:35:27
<transcript>: there's a whole

01:35:28
<transcript>: There's a whole.

01:35:28
<transcript>: give them the d

01:35:31
<transcript>: Give them the D. I. What? Welcome to Chat. General.

01:35:38
<transcript>: Captain, I can't say it can't say it not D and not category.

01:35:44
<transcript>: There's a whole section on SLA and slo, and I'm thinking of skipping it.

01:35:51
<transcript>: Do you seem like a cool streamer? But, man, I just can't look at the JS. Good luck. Your project.

01:35:53
<transcript>: That's funny.

01:35:53
<transcript>: it's not a js

01:36:00
<transcript>: It's not a JS fan. Adam, what kind of headphones do you use? There are HD 650s Sennheiser, HD 650.

01:36:03
<transcript>: Blake. Blake is here.

01:36:08
<transcript>: Okay. So what is what is different about this one.

01:36:08
<transcript>: it's

01:36:12
<transcript>: It's. Everything is different. So the G is not.

01:36:16
<transcript>: There is no G.

01:36:16
<transcript>: there is no

01:36:18
<transcript>: There is no G. That's what's different.

01:36:18
<transcript>: that's

01:36:25
<transcript>: That's what's different is they're just the pads are just loose. They're just laying there without a G rapper.

01:36:25
<transcript>: you know i'm saying

01:36:26
<transcript>: You know, I'm saying.

01:36:30
<transcript>: So if children one doesn't have any children.

01:36:30
<transcript>: then we know it's a

01:36:32
<transcript>: Then we know it's a weird case.

01:36:32
<transcript>: where

01:36:34
<transcript>: Where? Okay.

01:36:34
<transcript>: i

01:36:38
<transcript>: I hate Edge cases for one file.

01:36:39
lvl80dev: @blakegreendev I suggest wireless :),  there are plenty of good choices: Sony WH-1000XM4, Jabra Evolve2 85, Bose Headphones 700

01:36:40
<transcript>: Hardware time.

01:37:01
<transcript>: Okay, so we can handle the stop color situation pretty easily.

01:37:01
<transcript>: we can just

01:37:03
<transcript>: We can just copy.

01:37:06
<transcript>: This one.

01:37:12
<transcript>: That fixes that.

01:37:16
vagorge: how do you consistently wake up and get to working on ur projects this early

01:37:18
<transcript>: One We're gonna say.

01:37:18
<transcript>: if

01:37:19
<transcript>: If.

01:37:27
<transcript>: We do Children, one.

01:37:37
<transcript>: If it's not a gtype.

01:37:41
<transcript>: We'll do something.

01:37:41
<transcript>: else

01:37:42
<transcript>: Else.

01:37:48
<transcript>: We'll do this thing.

01:37:56
<transcript>: You're gonna have to say.

01:37:57
<transcript>: G.

01:38:02
<transcript>: This is in TypeScript I. Let G equals.

01:38:08
<transcript>: And then this is going to be.

01:38:21
<transcript>: Undefined is to be A. D.

01:38:35
<transcript>: Equals pass that map.

01:38:39
<transcript>: Like that.

01:38:45
<transcript>: Then this one is going to be weird. It's gonna be.

01:38:54
<transcript>: Equals SVG.

01:39:02
<transcript>: There is no doubt.

01:39:02
<transcript>: so it's actually

01:39:04
<transcript>: So it's actually just.

01:39:06
<transcript>: Yeah, it's just like this.

01:39:06
<transcript>: paz

01:39:07
<transcript>: Paz.

01:39:11
<transcript>: We skip the first one and the second one.

01:39:18
<transcript>: And then the remaining are the pads. That's right. And it looks terrible. But just ignore it.

01:39:21
<transcript>: This is just a script.

01:39:25
<transcript>: P equals SD still equals.

01:39:28
<transcript>: This.

01:39:33
<transcript>: Put down here.

01:39:38
<transcript>: And this can be comp.

01:39:40
<transcript>: compine

01:39:44
<transcript>: Compine paths up here so comps has.

01:39:51
<transcript>: Terrible. Then.

01:40:17
<transcript>: Okay.

01:40:20
<transcript>: Does It work.

01:40:24
<transcript>: No assignment to conservate, of course. Yeah.

01:40:26
<transcript>: Let.

01:40:30
<transcript>: 's.

01:40:32
<transcript>: Do this.

01:40:38
<transcript>: I just like the structure in that faze. I like doing that. So I'm doing it that way.

01:40:43
<transcript>: Okay. So we do have some without.

01:40:43
<transcript>: a

01:40:45
<transcript>: A D.

01:40:52
<transcript>: I break the basic case.

01:40:55
<transcript>: I broke the basic case, didn't I.

01:40:59
<transcript>: G? Sug Children one.

01:41:01
<transcript>: Oh.

01:41:06
<transcript>: Because I didn't check that this is actually let's see console.

01:41:06
<transcript>: log

01:41:07
<transcript>: Log.

01:41:07
<transcript>: svg

01:41:09
<transcript>: Svg.

01:41:09
<transcript>: children

01:41:10
<transcript>: Children.

01:41:10
<transcript>: one

01:41:11
<transcript>: One.

01:41:11
<transcript>: type

01:41:14
<transcript>: Type. Oh, it's not type. It's tag name.

01:41:17
<transcript>: That's from.

01:41:17
<transcript>: tag

01:41:19
<transcript>: Tag name.

01:41:23
<transcript>: No issues.

01:41:26
<transcript>: Alright.

01:41:28
<transcript>: How lost is everybody.

01:41:33
<transcript>: Go loss, but let's look at our file now we shouldn't have any that don't have D's or D's.

01:41:38
<transcript>: And in fact, I should be able to go to my game router.

01:41:38
<transcript>: and cat

01:41:42
<transcript>: And category now should be yeah, string.

01:41:48
<transcript>: And this should just be category independent, perfect. We did it.

01:41:48
<transcript>: we did

01:41:50
<transcript>: We did it.

01:41:53
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:41:53
<transcript>: how

01:42:00
<transcript>: How do you consistently wake up and get to working on your projects as early? I go to bed really early. The Gorge.

01:42:00
<transcript>: most days

01:42:05
<transcript>: Most days most days are gonna bed pretty early. That's why I get up early.

01:42:25
<transcript>: To get up early when you go to bed early.

01:42:32
<transcript>: All right.

01:42:36
<transcript>: What we do now. So we've returning.

01:42:39
<transcript>: Category in D. Here.

01:42:43
<transcript>: How's going to our index base.

01:42:44
blakegreendev: Thanks @lvl80dev !

01:42:57
<transcript>: Okay. So now.

01:43:01
<transcript>: Our SUG is going to be.

01:43:09
<transcript>: Here.

01:43:17
<transcript>: Okay.

01:43:21
<transcript>: That's gonna be a background.

01:43:21
<transcript>: okay

01:43:24
<transcript>: Okay. It's gonna be a Div.

01:43:26
<transcript>: With a background.

01:43:30
<transcript>: I.

01:43:30
<transcript>: 'm gonna

01:43:32
<transcript>: 'm gonna render the D.

01:43:38
<transcript>: How we gonna do that? We're gonna render the D.

01:43:42
<transcript>: Or we could probably just construct the SVG itself.

01:43:45
<transcript>: Could we.

01:43:45
caasidev: hello there mister!

01:43:47
papagebu: render the what?

01:43:57
<transcript>: Think about this. Render the what the the D. It's a path path data and an SVG.

01:44:05
<transcript>: Hello, There, Cassie.

01:44:13
<transcript>: Okay.

01:44:13
<transcript>: so

01:44:14
<transcript>: So.

01:44:16
<transcript>: I want to do this.

01:44:19
<transcript>: I just want to reconstruct the SUG.

01:44:19
<transcript>: on a cl

01:44:23
<transcript>: On a client based on the data that I have now.

01:44:27
<transcript>: Because that actually be pretty easy. Now that let me show you.

01:44:30
papagebu: owh, I thought deez nuts. Sorry for this

01:44:49
<transcript>: So here me out.

01:44:57
<transcript>: I thought you mean that.

01:45:01
<transcript>: Here's our linear gradient.

01:45:01
<transcript>: we can get the

01:45:04
<transcript>: We can get the colors for this gradient.

01:45:10
<transcript>: They're gonna drop in these stops based on the category, right.

01:45:15
<transcript>: In fact, I could just make it easier in return just to stop colors.

01:45:15
<transcript>: yeah we should do that

01:45:17
<transcript>: Yeah, we should do that.

01:45:21
<transcript>: Let's put that in the resource file.

01:45:23
<transcript>: I think the category is helpful.

01:45:23
<transcript>: we can do

01:45:24
<transcript>: We can do both.

01:45:30
<transcript>: Sorry I'm not done with the script. We're gonna come back here and we're gonna say.

01:45:33
<transcript>: Category.

01:45:37
<transcript>: And then we're going to say.

01:45:41
sockthedev: hey gang

01:45:42
<transcript>: We'll just do it on the image part. Yeah. Image.

01:45:48
<transcript>: We're gonna say Stop, one color.

01:45:57
<transcript>: Okay. Just like that. Now we're gonna write those to the file.

01:46:00
sockthedev: adam, do you deploy the next.js app to vercel or aws (or other)?

01:46:03
<transcript>: That's what we're done.

01:46:06
<transcript>: So let's go back up here.

01:46:20
<transcript>: Now we have stop one and stop two color pull the little less efficient, but I might want to use a category for something else in terms of game difficulty. And I'll explain at a later date.

01:46:25
<transcript>: Okay. So now if I have that in the game router.

01:46:32
<transcript>: I want to provide the answer Category D and then.

01:46:35
<transcript>: Top One color.

01:46:35
<transcript>: top

01:46:38
<transcript>: Top two color, I guess.

01:46:43
<transcript>: Category, then.

01:46:49
<transcript>: Yeah. So the D in the stop one stop. You color. Okay.

01:46:59
<transcript>: Color.

01:47:04
<transcript>: Okay, properties. Up to what.

01:47:04
<transcript>: did i miss it

01:47:07
<transcript>: Did I miss it? Stop. Two.

01:47:11
<transcript>: Then I have that on it.

01:47:15
<transcript>: What do I do.

01:47:22
<transcript>: That's just importing from resources, right? Maybe elsewhere. Maybe it didn't pick up the change.

01:47:25
<transcript>: Stop to color.

01:47:25
<transcript>: stop

01:47:28
<transcript>: Stop to color.

01:47:30
<transcript>: I didn't. Actually. Yeah.

01:47:33
oranje44: Greetings programs

01:47:33
<transcript>: Stop.

01:47:33
<transcript>: two color

01:47:34
<transcript>: Two color.

01:47:45
<transcript>: What's wrong with this? Get random item. Oh, I need to add it to the no, it's got it right there. Image. Oh, it's under image.

01:47:49
<transcript>: Okay. That's fine.

01:47:52
<transcript>: A little annoying, but it's fine.

01:47:59
<transcript>: Stop. One color.

01:47:59
<transcript>: two

01:48:01
<transcript>: Two color.

01:48:01
<transcript>: equals

01:48:02
<transcript>: Equals.

01:48:02
<transcript>: answer

01:48:04
<transcript>: Answer, image.

01:48:06
<transcript>: Okay.

01:48:08
oranje44: what you working?

01:48:09
<transcript>: So now on our front end.

01:48:09
<transcript>: here we go

01:48:14
<transcript>: Here we go. So now I can construct this. I can say this first stock color. Right here.

01:48:17
<transcript>: Is. This is so great.

01:48:21
<transcript>: Like this.

01:48:26
<transcript>: What are all these? These are from the.

01:48:31
<transcript>: Is there a current round or something.

01:48:38
<transcript>: Around.

01:48:45
<transcript>: No.

01:48:45
<transcript>: contact

01:48:46
<transcript>: Contact.

01:48:51
<transcript>: Around we're my types Where's my type Ed.

01:48:59
<transcript>: Here.

01:49:03
<transcript>: Contact game. Let's just contact.

01:49:03
<transcript>: okay

01:49:06
<transcript>: Okay, contacts.

01:49:06
<transcript>: game

01:49:07
<transcript>: Game.

01:49:10
<transcript>: Where's my tithe.

01:49:10
<transcript>: context

01:49:11
<transcript>: Context.

01:49:19
<transcript>: Oh, Wait, where is it.

01:49:19
<transcript>: wait for it

01:49:20
<transcript>: Wait for it.

01:49:20
<transcript>: greeting

01:49:24
<transcript>: Greetings Programs or Range. Welcome to chat.

01:49:24
<transcript>: ad

01:49:29
<transcript>: Adam, do you employ the next year SAP to Versaille or a Tobis or other? I'm gonna deploy it to verselle.

01:49:29
<transcript>: hey there

01:49:31
<transcript>: Hey, there's, sock.

01:49:31
<transcript>: so

01:49:33
<transcript>: Sock is here.

01:49:37
<transcript>: Fine Papa.

01:49:43
<transcript>: Sock. I get socked. The Dev confused with suckin Dev.

01:49:47
<transcript>: What are we working on? Aw, guess.

01:49:49
<transcript>: Working on AWS.

01:49:51
<transcript>: Context.

01:49:51
<transcript>: there's a contact

01:49:54
<transcript>: There's a contacts not exists here.

01:50:02
<transcript>: It's context round.

01:50:04
<transcript>: Oh, but it's.

01:50:04
<transcript>: could be

01:50:06
<transcript>: Could be null.

01:50:11
<transcript>: Context round.

01:50:12
percival6667: Hi, how long have you been coding? did you go to school or teach yourself?

01:50:14
<transcript>: I just have notes.

01:50:15
<transcript>: Recording.

01:50:23
<transcript>: Oh, here we go. It was recording a macro I'm Dumdum round dot.

01:50:24
<transcript>: Answer.

01:50:27
<transcript>: Right.

01:50:32
<transcript>: As our stop. One color does not what does not.

01:50:43
<transcript>: Stop. On what's the saying? Someone color does not exist on Type D. Stop. One color stop. Two color.

01:50:43
<transcript>: sure does

01:50:45
<transcript>: Sure does, but.

01:50:45
<transcript>: oh

01:50:52
<transcript>: Oh, we're undefined. Yeah, it's undefined. Possibly. That's fine. Stop. Two color. We'll get to that.

01:50:58
<transcript>: So if there's not a context.

01:50:58
<transcript>: around

01:51:01
<transcript>: Around answer we're gonna say.

01:51:10
<transcript>: I don't know. Those will just be all the undefined. That's fine. As you can just be undefined. It doesn't matter.

01:51:20
<transcript>: So there's our stop one color, and then stop two color is going to be right here.

01:51:24
<transcript>: Top two color. Let's see if this works.

01:51:27
<transcript>: And then let's go back here. G file.

01:51:32
<transcript>: None even. Okay. Here we go. That's not gonna be a thing anymore.

01:51:35
<transcript>: Look at this. Yeah, we're still doing it that way.

01:51:35
<transcript>: this right here

01:51:37
<transcript>: This right here. This data.

01:51:45
<transcript>: This path. Right here. All this is the D. This is the D.

01:51:45
<transcript>: we're

01:51:47
<transcript>: We're gonna replace with.

01:51:53
<transcript>: Okay.

01:51:56
<transcript>: So just.

01:51:56
<transcript>: delete this

01:51:58
<transcript>: Delete. This.

01:52:01
<transcript>: That's our Sud.

01:52:01
<transcript>: let's

01:52:03
<transcript>: Let's go down here.

01:52:09
<transcript>: And this is going to be instead of instead of image.

01:52:09
<transcript>: svg

01:52:10
<transcript>: Svg.

01:52:10
<transcript>: code u

01:52:15
<transcript>: Code. Uri component. That's it. We did it. We did it, did we do it? Did we do it.

01:52:19
<transcript>: Let's see if we did it.

01:52:42
<transcript>: What do we working? Okay, welcome to Chat. First of all. Hi. How long have you been coding? Did you go to school or teach yourself? So I went to school for a year and a half for computer science. And then I dropped out. And then I taught myself everything else, which is most of it.

01:52:47
<transcript>: What's wrong here? Can't resolve utils icons oh I gotta remove some stuff from.

01:52:51
<transcript>: Oops.

01:52:59
<transcript>: Let's see I gotta remove some stuff from app TSX. So this utils icon thing.

01:52:59
<transcript>: don't need

01:53:01
<transcript>: Don't need that anymore.

01:53:05
<transcript>: I think actually my package JSON.

01:53:05
<transcript>: these scripts

01:53:10
<transcript>: These scripts? We don't need to do? Oh, yeah? We need to do that. That's fine.

01:53:13
<transcript>: Let's just search icons.

01:53:13
<transcript>: or

01:53:17
<transcript>: Or Sprite, or SQG.

01:53:21
<transcript>: That's all good.

01:53:25
<transcript>: I think. Okay.

01:53:25
<transcript>: let's go back

01:53:27
<transcript>: Let's go back to our index.

01:53:32
<transcript>: Everything is saved. Oh, no, it's not.

01:53:37
<transcript>: No, I don't want to write to the hash. No.

01:53:39
<transcript>: Okay.

01:53:41
<transcript>: Wait. What.

01:53:44
<transcript>: Okay.

01:53:49
<transcript>: Let's start the dead server over.

01:53:57
<transcript>: Here we go, here we go. Did it work? Did it work? Did we create our SVG.

01:54:02
<transcript>: With a little less overhead.

01:54:04
<transcript>: Refresh.

01:54:06
<transcript>: New game.

01:54:10
<transcript>: Just do some housekeeping here.

01:54:10
<transcript>: okay

01:54:16
<transcript>: Okay, like that. I'm gonna pull the Dev tools. Okay. New game.

01:54:16
<transcript>: can we do it

01:54:20
<transcript>: Can we do it? We did it. That snowmobile.

01:54:20
<transcript>: we did it

01:54:25
<transcript>: We did it. We're so we're constructing that SVG kind of dynamicly now. So that now.

01:54:25
<transcript>: oh

01:54:31
<transcript>: Oh, wait. What? Oh, yeah. Those are just daily rails. So now the round when it comes back over the wire.

01:54:34
<transcript>: Every time we.

01:54:40
<transcript>: Wait, what is this game? Id. Preview.

01:54:42
<transcript>: What is this.

01:54:47
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:54:53
<transcript>: So every time we get a new round I thought when we answered we got around back do we not.

01:54:58
<transcript>: Answer. Snowbub correct. True. Expired false. Game.

01:55:02
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah. So every time we get a new round now.

01:55:04
<transcript>: It's.

01:55:04
<transcript>: got that data

01:55:05
<transcript>: Got that data.

01:55:05
<transcript>: embedded here

01:55:07
<transcript>: Embedded here in the payload.

01:55:07
<transcript>: so see the

01:55:10
<transcript>: So see the answer has the D the stop colors.

01:55:10
<transcript>: instead of

01:55:21
<transcript>: Instead of like sending a whole SVG, all that extra stuff. That's the same on every SUG. We just eliminated it from the network. And now we just return.

01:55:32
<transcript>: The essential data to render that SVG, but we do it on every round so you're not able the downside you're not able to cash these SVGs, but the upside is you don't have to download the whole list.

01:55:32
<transcript>: and i

01:55:38
<transcript>: And I can send it with the payload so that the round starts when you receive that payload.

01:55:43
<transcript>: It allows for like you're not another network request right.

01:55:43
<transcript>: how big is

01:55:48
<transcript>: How big is it? Two 8. That's bigger than I thought.

01:55:48
<transcript>: each

01:55:53
<transcript>: Each round is almost 3 KB. Is that right.

01:55:56
<transcript>: That's bigger than I thought it would be.

01:55:59
<transcript>: Round One. Let's see.

01:56:02
<transcript>: Why is it that big? Let's look at this payload again.

01:56:06
<transcript>: That's not very efficient.

01:56:14
<transcript>: Choices look like that. Oh, that's too much data in those. Oh, I need to strip it out, and you strip out the D. Yeah, yeah. So we bloated this really bad.

01:56:14
<transcript>: choice

01:56:17
<transcript>: Choices. We can remove everything.

01:56:20
<transcript>: But the prefix and the name.

01:56:24
<transcript>: I don't need any of these.

01:56:24
<transcript>: so i'll

01:56:26
<transcript>: So I'll prune that that'll help.

01:56:26
<transcript>: also

01:56:28
<transcript>: Also.

01:56:28
<transcript>: end game id

01:56:31
<transcript>: End game ID. Start. What else can I strip out of here.

01:56:40
<transcript>: That's pretty minimal in the answer. So let's fix that and that should drop from that shouldn't be 3 KB like we should not have three kilobyte rounds.

01:56:44
<transcript>: That's just gonna be a little heavy.

01:56:51
<transcript>: So that's in our game router.

01:57:01
<transcript>: Up here when we create a new round. Yeah. Here. So we're doing choices. We're I don't need all this stuff. I don't need the image at all.

01:57:05
<transcript>: Why am I doing that all I need.

01:57:05
<transcript>: from the choice

01:57:07
<transcript>: From the choice is.

01:57:10
<transcript>: Name.

01:57:16
<transcript>: In fact, I'm just gonna do like this.

01:57:21
<transcript>: Name and prefix.

01:57:25
<transcript>: Name prefix.

01:57:27
<transcript>: All I need? Right.

01:57:27
<transcript>: think so

01:57:28
<transcript>: Think so.

01:57:30
<transcript>: I think so.

01:57:30
<transcript>: i think

01:57:36
<transcript>: I think for the follow, Perceval and obscene burrito an enzyc. I miss all those.

01:57:41
<transcript>: Miss them all. Thank you for the follows. Appreciate them so much.

01:57:41
<transcript>: when you people

01:57:49
<transcript>: When you people follow me makes me think you'll come back and I love working with people here on Twitch, hanging out with me.

01:57:49
<transcript>: and

01:57:52
<transcript>: And I hope you come back that's great.

01:57:56
<transcript>: New game. Let's see if the rounds are smaller now.

01:57:59
<transcript>: Game round. How big is that one.

01:58:03
<transcript>: 6 KB.

01:58:03
<transcript>: so

01:58:06
<transcript>: So we like have it.

01:58:09
<transcript>: Have it.

01:58:09
<transcript>: is that good enough

01:58:10
<transcript>: Is that good enough.

01:58:10
<transcript>: is

01:58:13
<transcript>: Is one 6 KB for every Ram.

01:58:19
<transcript>: Too heavy. Let's just play this on the slow three G and see what feels like.

01:58:22
<transcript>: See what that feels like.

01:58:22
<transcript>: so this is

01:58:24
<transcript>: So this is what snowball edge.

01:58:28
<transcript>: So slow to answer.

01:58:32
<transcript>: Sync box or something? Honeycoat, what is this.

01:58:35
<transcript>: Service Catalog Honey code.

01:58:38
<transcript>: Got it.

01:58:38
<transcript>: we got to work

01:58:42
<transcript>: We got to work on the visuals here. That's DynamoDB. I know that one.

01:58:55
<transcript>: So we're downloading this is on slow three G and it feels okay. It doesn't feel terrible. So one 5 KB on these rounds.

01:58:55
<transcript>: i think

01:58:57
<transcript>: I think this works.

01:59:00
<transcript>: What is this one Fleetwise. Maybe.

01:59:00
<transcript>: i don't know

01:59:05
<transcript>: I don't know why this is so slow. Why is that mutation so slow.

01:59:08
<transcript>: So, what is this.

01:59:08
<transcript>: bracket

01:59:11
<transcript>: Bracket Mainframe modernization.

01:59:21
<transcript>: Bracket and going bracket. I think I'm wrong. Oh, I was right if I got name wrong yet six of them that is not pinpoint.

01:59:21
<transcript>: is it yeah it is

01:59:22
<transcript>: Is it? Yeah, it is.

01:59:25
<transcript>: I got fooled by this one once.

01:59:27
<transcript>: Now this fan point. Okay.

01:59:31
<transcript>: Don't overthink it. Let's Kinesis something. Data analytics. Yep.

01:59:42
<transcript>: I may have made a game that only I would ever play. I'm not sure I don't know if anyone else cares to guess what these aid of his services are.

01:59:42
<transcript>: or

01:59:45
<transcript>: Or if I'm just a super AWS nerd.

01:59:54
<transcript>: Set up.

02:00:00
<transcript>: So I gotta look into why is that so slow? Why is that mutation so so slow? This is really slow.

02:00:09
<transcript>: Like the time it takes to figure out what is the right answer. Right here. Like that takes way too long. So let's look at that.

02:00:17
<transcript>: I do hate not using my typical stack and not feeling like I know how to really like, make it faster.

02:00:23
<transcript>: So what's happens when you answer.

02:00:29
<transcript>: Efficient answer. Here we go.

02:00:29
<transcript>: what do we do

02:00:34
<transcript>: What do we do? We say find unique. So find the round.

02:00:40
<transcript>: Include the grant the game so that queries probably not the fastest.

02:00:45
<transcript>: For doing. I mean, there's no data in here. It shouldn't be slow.

02:00:45
<transcript>: and

02:00:48
<transcript>: And we say we get the answer.

02:00:48
<transcript>: we

02:00:50
<transcript>: We do some basic.

02:00:50
<transcript>: math

02:00:53
<transcript>: Math stuff and calculate. Okay. So here we go.

02:00:53
<transcript>: we do

02:00:57
<transcript>: We do a transaction with these two updates.

02:00:57
<transcript>: update

02:01:00
<transcript>: Update the round and the game so.

02:01:03
<transcript>: In the score of the game.

02:01:09
<transcript>: Whether it's on a street and the new Expiration time.

02:01:15
<transcript>: But we're also updating the round with what? What are we opening updating the round with.

02:01:15
<transcript>: oh win it

02:01:16
<transcript>: Oh win it ended.

02:01:16
<transcript>: i don't know

02:01:18
<transcript>: I don't know this. Like.

02:01:20
<transcript>: One.

02:01:22
<transcript>: Query like we do one.

02:01:22
<transcript>: fetch

02:01:26
<transcript>: Fetch from the database. And then we do.

02:01:26
<transcript>: two

02:01:43
<transcript>: Two rights for every answer. And it's super slow. Is this just a Prisma thing? Is Prisma just slow? This is my first experience using Prisma. The whole point of this, I was trying to build this whole thing with the T three stack and learn about the T three stack. Is Prisma just super slow? Can someone tell me.

02:01:47
sockthedev: someone else in here was complaining about their MBP 2019 Intel 16" not being able to handle OBS and extra screens etc. I have a fix that works finally!

02:01:50
<transcript>: I could go to a planet scale.

02:01:52
sockthedev: Prisma is slow!

02:01:57
sockthedev: Kysely for the win!

02:02:04
<transcript>: Elison here was complaining about their MacBook pro 2019 until 16 not be able to hit OBS and extra screens, etc. I have a fix that works. Finally nice Prisma is slow kaisely for the win.

02:02:04
<transcript>: okay

02:02:14
<transcript>: Okay. So maybe my issue is is Prisma. I know DAX uses Kindsley. Maybe I should swap out Prisma and use kaisely.

02:02:14
<transcript>: let's go to

02:02:19
<transcript>: Let's go to our plan scale database today. I think they have some kind of like.

02:02:22
<transcript>: Performance I can look at like.

02:02:27
<transcript>: Kind of look at the.

02:02:27
<transcript>: insights

02:02:28
<transcript>: Insights.

02:02:29
sockthedev: Insights tab

02:02:31
<transcript>: I'm also new to this.

02:02:33
<transcript>: So, what? I.

02:02:37
<transcript>: Follow Gabriel.

02:02:40
sockthedev: you may have a bad inde

02:02:42
<transcript>: So select from intracial tables. Count that's a bunch of them.

02:02:45
sockthedev: or a missing index

02:02:46
<transcript>: Insert into game.

02:02:46
<transcript>: count

02:02:48
<transcript>: Count.

02:02:54
<transcript>: So where. What am I looking for? Here? Oh, branch. I want to go the X state branch.

02:03:06
<transcript>: What? The milliseconds. So these are all super fast. The database operations appear to be snappy.

02:03:08
<transcript>: Two milliseconds.

02:03:12
<transcript>: Is my slowest.

02:03:12
<transcript>: so

02:03:14
<transcript>: So these are not the problem.

02:03:14
<transcript>: it's

02:03:23
<transcript>: It's Prisma. Whoa. Is it? Is it Prisma? Is it that simple? Is prism adding that much Bloat? Like, let's see what that.

02:03:27
lilfreezi: is there a good comment plugin for nvim

02:03:29
<transcript>: Does network calls look like the timing on that answer call? How long does it take? Let's look at it right now.

02:03:31
<transcript>: Answer.

02:03:37
<transcript>: Right here. Timing.

02:03:40
<transcript>: So something like.

02:03:40
<transcript>: seven

02:03:43
<transcript>: 726 milliseconds.

02:03:48
<transcript>: What are the pieces involved here.

02:03:48
<transcript>: so

02:03:49
<transcript>: So.

02:03:55
<transcript>: It's my local it's his local node JS server running next.

02:03:59
<transcript>: That's doing the API routes.

02:03:59
<transcript>: so

02:04:01
<transcript>: So TRPC.

02:04:10
<transcript>: Handles that communication with Next JS the backend for Next JS. The back end is doing Prisma stuff.

02:04:10
<transcript>: gener

02:04:14
<transcript>: Generating with plant scale if the plan scale queries are fast.

02:04:17
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow I Rolland.

02:04:23
<transcript>: May have a bad index, but the table I mean the database seems to be.

02:04:23
<transcript>: snapshot

02:04:26
<transcript>: Snapshot. I don't think.

02:04:35
sockthedev: yeah, didn't see that before my comment

02:04:37
<transcript>: We don't have any slow looking queries here and there's like no data in this database. So it shouldn't be a slow issue, an index issue or anything with the database. Like the database is fast.

02:04:37
<transcript>: how can i quickly

02:04:38
sockthedev: db looks good

02:04:39
<transcript>: How can I quickly test this.

02:04:42
<transcript>: Dv. Looks good.

02:04:48
<transcript>: So, what's? Taking 700 milliseconds? This is so slow.

02:04:49
<transcript>: slowly slow

02:04:50
<transcript>: Slowly, slow.

02:04:53
the_jolza: Is it cold starts with Prisma?

02:04:55
sockthedev: and it's all local

02:04:58
<transcript>: How could I guess I could start doing some, like timing stuff.

02:04:58
<transcript>: in my back

02:05:03
sockthedev: except for db?

02:05:07
<transcript>: In my back end so we could like, try and profile this. Well, how does everyone do this? If you want to profile like, do you just start using console time? Is that however, does this.

02:05:10
daglee: @LilFreezi comment.nvim is my favorite

02:05:14
<transcript>: And it's all local, except for DB. That's right, Sock. It's all local.

02:05:14
<transcript>: comment

02:05:16
<transcript>: Comment in them is my favorite.

02:05:24
<transcript>: Is it cold starts with prison. I mean, it shouldn't be cold starts because we're just continually using this thing, you know.

02:05:24
<transcript>: i'm answering

02:05:28
<transcript>: I'm answering it back to backtoback there shouldn't be any cold starts.

02:05:34
<transcript>: So like Application Cost Profile, would it Personal Health Dashboard? Let's see how long this last one takes.

02:05:38
<transcript>: So that's so slow.

02:05:40
sockthedev: performance.now()?

02:05:43
<transcript>: Waiting for server for 2 seconds like what in the world.

02:05:46
<transcript>: What? Why.

02:05:51
<transcript>: Performance. Dot. Now is that is that a node thing.

02:05:54
<transcript>: So I can say, let's see.

02:05:56
daglee: 2 second?! File a ticket!

02:05:58
<transcript>: Console. I know console that time.

02:06:02
<transcript>: How does this work? I do.

02:06:08
<transcript>: Timelabel. And then I do time, end.

02:06:11
<transcript>: That it.

02:06:17
<transcript>: 's.

02:06:20
<transcript>: First query we can measure.

02:06:24
<transcript>: I'm gonna do like console log.

02:06:24
<transcript>: or time log

02:06:26
<transcript>: Or time log.

02:06:30
<transcript>: I'm saying, just put this in there.

02:06:30
daglee: Have you tried pocketbase? Thinking about using it for a weekend project.

02:06:43
<transcript>: 2 seconds. File a ticket. Have you tried Pocketbase thinking about using it for a weekend project? I have not tried Pocket base.

02:06:43
<transcript>: in fact

02:06:44
<transcript>: In fact.

02:06:46
<transcript>: Okay.

02:06:46
<transcript>: let's

02:06:50
<transcript>: Let's. Let's do this. Let's do the first one.

02:06:52
<transcript>: Like.

02:06:56
<transcript>: Time.

02:06:58
<transcript>: And I guess.

02:07:02
<transcript>: Do I do time and then time end.

02:07:05
daglee: Pocketbase is like a selfhosted cloud that is just 1 file.

02:07:08
<transcript>: I will do this first one is.

02:07:08
<transcript>: find

02:07:09
<transcript>: Find unique.

02:07:15
<transcript>: Like that? Will that work.

02:07:23
<transcript>: Who does performance stuff on the back end? Someone tells me, Is this what you would do.

02:07:26
<transcript>: Okay, let's just try it.

02:07:27
lilfreezi: @LilFreezi thx :)

02:07:32
<transcript>: Let's just try it. Answer one and see.

02:07:32
<transcript>: over on

02:07:35
<transcript>: Over on slow 3G.

02:07:35
<transcript>: oh

02:07:41
<transcript>: Oh, is the slow three G to my payload now? No, it's waiting on server for 2 seconds.

02:07:41
<transcript>: so

02:07:42
<transcript>: So.

02:07:42
<transcript>: that's an issue

02:07:44
<transcript>: That's an issue.

02:07:50
<transcript>: I'm going to turn off slow 3G. What's? What's taking forever right now.

02:07:50
<transcript>: is my

02:07:53
<transcript>: Is my bundle giant.

02:07:58
<transcript>: Is it a giant bundle problem 1 MB.

02:07:58
<transcript>: now does that have

02:08:05
<transcript>: Now, does that have the SCG Sprite in it? Did I get rid of the SUG Sprite thing? I think I got rid of it. I got rid of it. Yeah.

02:08:14
<transcript>: We'll take a look at that later. So when I answer, I don't know what this one is. First one sidewise. I don't know. That's right.

02:08:17
<transcript>: How long did that one take.

02:08:20
<transcript>: Game answer.

02:08:22
<transcript>: Timing.

02:08:27
<transcript>: Seven, almost 700 milliseconds. So that's too slow.

02:08:30
<transcript>: Did my timing stuff, work.

02:08:32
daglee: At least it's faster than twitter.

02:08:33
<transcript>: Should import.

02:08:35
<transcript>: I don't see it.

02:08:42
<transcript>: Am I missing the time.

02:08:42
<transcript>: lisa

02:08:44
<transcript>: Lisa's Faster than Twitter.

02:08:52
<transcript>: Did I did I did I do something wrong with the console that time.

02:08:58
<transcript>: Should not import the names export filter imported as resources from default exporting module.

02:09:02
<transcript>: Only default export is available soon.

02:09:05
<transcript>: Okay.

02:09:08
<transcript>: We'll take a look at that.

02:09:18
<transcript>: Okay, so the timing thing did not work. Console time. I just need, like, a primer on this.

02:09:23
<transcript>: Example.

02:09:30
<transcript>: Start the time where you can use to track how long an operation takes. Give each timer a unique name.

02:09:33
<transcript>: When you call.

02:09:35
<transcript>: Well, this works in node JS. Right.

02:09:35
<transcript>: it's

02:09:37
<transcript>: It's not just a browser thing.

02:09:44
<transcript>: Is this just a browser thing? No. Is it.

02:09:55
<transcript>: So time label? Okay, here we go. Console time.

02:09:58
<transcript>: Console time end.

02:10:08
<transcript>: That's what I'm doing, right.

02:10:08
<transcript>: yeah

02:10:10
<transcript>: Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

02:10:10
<transcript>: did i

02:10:11
<transcript>: Did I.

02:10:11
<transcript>: save

02:10:13
<transcript>: Save the file.

02:10:26
<transcript>: Hi Man. So console time. Resolve. What is this? This is a mutation.

02:10:28
<transcript>: And unique.

02:10:31
<transcript>: Finding.

02:10:36
<transcript>: Maybe I had.

02:10:36
<transcript>: maybe i hadn't

02:10:38
<transcript>: Maybe I hadn't saved the buffer.

02:10:46
<transcript>: Let's try it again.

02:11:00
<transcript>: Okay new game.

02:11:02
<transcript>: Gonna answer.

02:11:05
<transcript>: I don't know.

02:11:05
<transcript>: device

02:11:14
<transcript>: Device. Defender. That is a shield. That makes sense. Okay. Did it give us any timing over here? No, it's a lot of prisoner logging.

02:11:17
<transcript>: But none of our timing information.

02:11:19
<transcript>: Why is that.

02:11:24
<transcript>: Why is it not working? Why can't I not log anything inside of a TrpC.

02:11:24
<transcript>: oops

02:11:25
<transcript>: Oops.

02:11:29
<transcript>: Kind of can I not log anything in here.

02:11:31
<transcript>: What happens if I log.

02:11:34
<transcript>: The TrpC.

02:11:35
<transcript>: Resolvers.

02:11:45
<transcript>: In there.

02:11:51
<transcript>: Five client and service successfully does it actually just automatically update that.

02:11:59
<transcript>: How do I turn off the prisoner logging? Like if I just don't want prison, that's up.

02:12:03
<transcript>: Turn off Prisma logging.

02:12:10
<transcript>: Where's next? When I need them. I need Nextle.

02:12:13
<transcript>: Figure logging.

02:12:20
<transcript>: Where is our Prisma client.

02:12:27
<transcript>: Prisma.

02:12:30
<transcript>: Here we go.

02:12:37
<transcript>: Create round.

02:12:39
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:12:48
<transcript>: What.

02:12:56
<transcript>: Does.

02:12:59
<transcript>: There's some things I don't understand here.

02:13:08
<transcript>: The context from TRPC has the Prisma client. How does how do I, how do I? How do I? How do I TRPC.

02:13:08
<transcript>: what is

02:13:13
<transcript>: What is it? What? How's all this glued together? Like where.

02:13:18
<transcript>: Prisma. Here we go. Global Prisma. Okay.

02:13:22
<transcript>: This is where I can say Ah, yeah? It's right here.

02:13:22
<transcript>: i

02:13:24
<transcript>: I want to just not log.

02:13:29
<transcript>: Error.

02:13:29
<transcript>: or

02:13:31
<transcript>: Or not, I want to actually log.

02:13:31
<transcript>: just

02:13:35
<transcript>: Just the Prism client so log error.

02:13:38
<transcript>: Okay.

02:13:43
<transcript>: Because right now in development, it's doing all of the queries as well. I don't want that.

02:13:43
<transcript>: okay

02:13:44
<transcript>: Okay.

02:13:48
<transcript>: There's our Prisma client.

02:13:48
<transcript>: in the next question

02:13:49
<transcript>: In the next question.

02:13:49
<transcript>: is

02:13:50
<transcript>: Is.

02:13:55
<transcript>: That automatically.

02:13:55
<transcript>: i don't i

02:14:00
<transcript>: I don't I can't ever tell if the server automatically refreshes actually knew the answer to that one, and it didn't.

02:14:08
<transcript>: Okay. Chat died. Where did everybody go? Everybody's just busy. Busy working.

02:14:10
<transcript>: I get it.

02:14:13
<transcript>: I'm also busy working.

02:14:24
<transcript>: Back end, agent. I don't know. Whoever seen that one.

02:14:26
<transcript>: Worked okay.

02:14:26
<transcript>: see

02:14:27
<transcript>: See.

02:14:30
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: Listening to the ASMR that is your keyboard and your voice. It's like a coffee bar but better

02:14:30
lilfreezi: messing with my neovim and tmux configs

02:14:36
<transcript>: Made it find unique? Here we go now we've got some longing it was just buried. I just couldn't see it in all the Prisma logging? That could be the past that could be possible.

02:14:39
<transcript>: So now we got logs.

02:14:39
<transcript>: feels good

02:14:41
<transcript>: Feels good.

02:14:41
<transcript>: let's

02:14:44
<transcript>: Let's go back here so that's our.

02:14:49
<transcript>: Find unique.

02:14:51
<transcript>: Let's do.

02:14:56
<transcript>: All this calculations stuff should be like Instant, right.

02:14:59
<transcript>: Console.

02:14:59
<transcript>: time

02:15:00
<transcript>: Time.

02:15:03
<transcript>: Scoring.

02:15:06
<transcript>: Something.

02:15:12
<transcript>: All of that should just be instant.

02:15:20
<transcript>: We're going to log it anyway.

02:15:20
<transcript>: and then

02:15:24
<transcript>: And then this right here. So we're gonna do two things we're gonna say.

02:15:24
<transcript>: console

02:15:26
<transcript>: Console time.

02:15:29
<transcript>: Round updates.

02:15:32
<transcript>: And we're gonna say, console.

02:15:32
<transcript>: ins

02:15:33
woofwoofdude: @LilFreezi fyi, might wanna look at tmuxinator if you don't know already

02:15:34
<transcript>: Ins. Time.

02:15:34
<transcript>: in

02:15:39
<transcript>: In Ram update, and then we're gonna do the same thing.

02:15:43
<transcript>: We're game.

02:15:45
<transcript>: Oops.

02:16:00
<transcript>: Okay, so game update, round update, and then we're gonna do this transaction where we actually await.

02:16:00
<transcript>: console

02:16:02
<transcript>: Console time.

02:16:05
<transcript>: Wait.

02:16:05
<transcript>: trans

02:16:07
<transcript>: Transaction.

02:16:14
<transcript>: Hi Manda Weight transaction.

02:16:18
<transcript>: Okay.

02:16:21
<transcript>: That's it that's everything that happens in there, right.

02:16:24
<transcript>: We start it.

02:16:31
<transcript>: Okay.

02:16:33
<transcript>: Here we go.

02:16:47
<transcript>: Listening to the ASMR that is your keyboard in your office. It's like a coffee bar, but better. That's awesome. Messing with my Neil, Vim and Timothy. That sounds awful. Now it's fine. It's fun. Thanks for the follow El Roland. I don't know if I said that earlier.

02:16:54
<transcript>: I don't know if I said it. Here we go. See if the timing.

02:16:59
<transcript>: Makes sense to us that's cloud development kit right? Cdk.

02:16:59
<transcript>: okay

02:17:03
<transcript>: Okay. Here we go find unique 171 milliseconds.

02:17:03
<transcript>: sc

02:17:15
<transcript>: Scoring nothing roundup takes nothing. Okay the transaction. So that's the two the two things that make sense. Game update actually does take 142 milliseconds, even though.

02:17:18
<transcript>: We're not waiting on that update, right.

02:17:18
<transcript>: am i doing

02:17:26
<transcript>: Am I doing this right? Am I doing Prisma Prisma transactions? Am I doing it right to do the fast way.

02:17:29
<transcript>: Is that the fastest way.

02:17:36
<transcript>: So I'm glad that the overhead is not like something.

02:17:36
<transcript>: more difficult to work

02:17:38
<transcript>: More difficult to work to change.

02:17:38
<transcript>: the

02:17:42
<transcript>: The fact that it is the Prisma. Queries.

02:17:45
<transcript>: I can swap out Prisma.

02:17:45
<transcript>: i kind of

02:17:47
<transcript>: I kind of want to just get rid of prison.

02:17:50
<transcript>: Anyone? Anyone? Force.

02:17:52
lilfreezi: @WoofWoofDude checking it out thx

02:17:55
<transcript>: Is so slow? Why is it so slow? Let's try kaisely.

02:18:01
<transcript>: Is there like a fast mode? Did I just turn on slow mode.

02:18:03
<transcript>: Let's go kaisely.

02:18:19
<transcript>: Let's do this. I'm done with Prisma. What am I gonna lose? When I get rid of Prisma? I'm gonna lose, like the Ski, all the migrations and stuff. That's all part of.

02:18:20
<transcript>: That's all part of.

02:18:20
<transcript>: prism

02:18:29
<transcript>: Prisma. Right? I could still use Prisma and just use Kaisely at runtime with that. Give me any benefit. No, probably not.

02:18:35
<transcript>: Okay.

02:18:41
<transcript>: How does how does one use this with planet scale planet scale.

02:18:50
<transcript>: Oh, Kaisely Planet scale. So I need to use this.

02:18:55
<transcript>: Usage Plan of Skill dialog.

02:18:55
<transcript>: db

02:19:00
<transcript>: Db New Kisley Database Dialogue Plan Scale dialect.

02:19:00
<transcript>: posterior

02:19:01
<transcript>: Posterior password.

02:19:04
<transcript>: And then we say.

02:19:08
<transcript>: Format function.

02:19:17
<transcript>: So how does Cal? How does code work.

02:19:17
<transcript>: basically

02:19:20
<transcript>: Basically, here we go.

02:19:20
<transcript>: so i define

02:19:22
<transcript>: So I define the tables like this.

02:19:26
<transcript>: That makes sense. And then we have.

02:19:26
<transcript>: a

02:19:29
<transcript>: A DB, which is a Kaizly database.

02:19:32
<transcript>: That has our tables.

02:19:32
<transcript>: okay

02:19:33
<transcript>: Okay.

02:19:37
<transcript>: Created one. I start my app and then.

02:19:37
<transcript>: add demo

02:19:44
<transcript>: Add demo let's see it's doing a weight DB insert into let's do the before we rip out Prisma.

02:19:51
<transcript>: Let's do a metal test to just see if we can replace these two queries. Right.

02:19:53
<transcript>: And see if they're faster.

02:19:53
<transcript>: yeah

02:19:55
<transcript>: Yeah, like it.

02:19:57
<transcript>: I like it.

02:20:01
<transcript>: So we're gonna create a new Kaisely thing.

02:20:06
<transcript>: This Prisma schema up here.

02:20:10
<transcript>: And then.

02:20:15
<transcript>: Close some of this and so go get server off session DB client.

02:20:19
<transcript>: This we're gonna put we're gonna put Kaisely in here.

02:20:21
woofwoofdude: @adamdotdev little bit confused by your console.time(s). what are you trying to time if they don't actually execute the update ?

02:20:25
<transcript>: Global varsma.

02:20:28
<transcript>: Okay.

02:20:32
<transcript>: I'm just going to start divining defining it in here.

02:20:35
<transcript>: First we got to add.

02:20:39
<transcript>: Pmpm.

02:20:41
<transcript>: Install.

02:20:43
<transcript>: What was it? Kaisely.

02:20:43
<transcript>: and plant

02:20:45
<transcript>: And plant scale.

02:20:51
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:20:54
<transcript>: Here.

02:20:54
<transcript>: add

02:20:56
<transcript>: Add.

02:20:58
<transcript>: Kaisely Plant scale.

02:20:58
<transcript>: oh plants

02:21:03
<transcript>: Oh, Plantscale database. Is that the serverless driver? I guess.

02:21:07
<transcript>: So.

02:21:16
<transcript>: A little bit confused by your console times. What are you trying to time if they don't actually execute the update.

02:21:26
<transcript>: So I just wanted to put that in to be thorough. And I was surprised to see that even not awaiting that game update it still took.

02:21:33
<transcript>: Oh, I'm sorry it didn't even take a millisecond. Ha. Okay. I thought it said 142 milliseconds.

02:21:33
<transcript>: where was that

02:21:45
<transcript>: Where was that? Where's that code? Where was that timing. Okay, I misread this. Sorry, it wasn't 142 milliseconds. It was 0142. Okay, so those are instant. These were all instant. The only thing it took time were the two queries find. You need.

02:21:55
<transcript>: Took 171 milliseconds, and the transaction that did the two rights took 539 milliseconds. It just doesn't make sense.

02:21:57
<transcript>: Because.

02:21:57
<transcript>: if we

02:22:01
<transcript>: If we look at our plan scale like no queries are taking more than.

02:22:01
<transcript>: a couple

02:22:03
<transcript>: A couple milliseconds.

02:22:07
<transcript>: Like what's the problem here.

02:22:10
<transcript>: This is a tiny database. There's nothing in it.

02:22:14
<transcript>: The worst offenders are taking like six, eight milliseconds.

02:22:14
<transcript>: there

02:22:16
<transcript>: There's no reason.

02:22:16
<transcript>: i should wait

02:22:19
<transcript>: I should wait 539 milliseconds.

02:22:21
woofwoofdude: But if i read the code properly, all you do is register the update to be executed by the transaction at the  end

02:22:21
<transcript>: For that right.

02:22:24
<transcript>: Am I just Am I crazy.

02:22:31
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: Maybe because you are awaiting for confirmation of write?

02:22:32
<transcript>: All you do is register the updates. We execute a transaction at the end. Yeah, yeah. We need to delete the I'll delete those two timings that don't make sense.

02:22:35
player__piano: whats is the region of planetscale db

02:22:39
<transcript>: Okay. So we're going to define our Kaisely thing here. Did I actually add it.

02:22:43
<transcript>: Did I had it.

02:22:48
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: What if you do it async write to DB?

02:22:48
<transcript>: Scale Database Kaisely and Kaisely Planets go.

02:22:52
<transcript>: Usage.

02:22:52
<transcript>: here we

02:22:54
<transcript>: Here. We're going to create our database.

02:23:03
<transcript>: Maybe because you're waiting for confirmation of right.

02:23:06
<transcript>: The Real enrich.

02:23:13
<transcript>: So you're saying I could fire that off and not await it, and it would still work? Oh, that would be a lot easier.

02:23:13
<transcript>: if

02:23:14
<transcript>: If.

02:23:17
<transcript>: Hang on. Let's try that.

02:23:25
<transcript>: Let's try that. I still have to do the first query. What if you do it async right to DB? Yeah, let's try that.

02:23:25
<transcript>: what is

02:23:27
woofwoofdude: Fire and forget db calls ?

02:23:28
<transcript>: What is the region of planet scale DB.

02:23:32
<transcript>: Great question. Probably us. Each one is at the default.

02:23:37
woofwoofdude: doesn't sound that great

02:23:39
<transcript>: So the.

02:23:39
<transcript>: saying there is some

02:23:44
<transcript>: Saying there is some latency. I think it's us east. One. Where do I see.

02:23:53
<transcript>: Anybody know where I can find that.

02:24:01
<transcript>: I don't know, I don't know where I can find the.

02:24:09
<transcript>: Fire and forget DB calls doesn't sound that great. Yeah. I mean.

02:24:09
<transcript>: if it

02:24:10
<transcript>: If it fails.

02:24:19
<transcript>: No. I actually need the Do I need the response? No. Yeah, I do. I need the response from the. No, I don't. What am I talking about? Do I need it.

02:24:28
<transcript>: Let's go back. Let's go back to the game router. So here you're saying I could. Okay. So first of all, I don't need.

02:24:28
<transcript>: i don't

02:24:30
<transcript>: I don't need any of this.

02:24:35
<transcript>: And I don't need to.

02:24:46
<transcript>: Just need the transaction in that first query so we have find unique and then the transaction. As you're saying, if I don't await this now I need the game.

02:24:46
<transcript>: i need a game

02:24:50
<transcript>: I need a game that comes back from the game update.

02:24:50
<transcript>: i

02:24:53
<transcript>: I guess I could probably build it up optimistically.

02:24:55
<transcript>: In memory.

02:24:57
<transcript>: I could do that.

02:24:57
<transcript>: yeah

02:25:00
<transcript>: Yeah. Let's try it. Is that dangerous.

02:25:00
<transcript>: what does that mean

02:25:02
<transcript>: What does that mean? That means.

02:25:06
<transcript>: Let's say we just did this.

02:25:11
<transcript>: We just fire and forget.

02:25:14
<transcript>: And then game. We just build a.

02:25:14
<transcript>: manually

02:25:15
<transcript>: Manually.

02:25:18
<transcript>: So the game is going to be.

02:25:18
<transcript>: data

02:25:20
<transcript>: Data. Dot.

02:25:24
<transcript>: I have the gain somewhere.

02:25:26
<transcript>: Around.

02:25:34
<transcript>: That game so I can say.

02:25:34
<transcript>: round

02:25:39
<transcript>: Round game and then we can just add the changes so the score.

02:25:39
<transcript>: is

02:25:43
<transcript>: Is going to be round game.

02:25:43
<transcript>: plus

02:25:45
<transcript>: Plus equals.

02:25:47
<transcript>: Four Delta.

02:25:58
<transcript>: The expires. It's going to be that in streak. Okay, so we can do this. We try. This cannot be applied to what game and number. Oh really.

02:26:01
<transcript>: Scores.

02:26:05
<transcript>: Let's try this. I mean, why not.

02:26:06
<transcript>: Try it.

02:26:11
<transcript>: What's wrong here? Round and principle implicitly had type.

02:26:11
<transcript>: i've seen this before

02:26:12
<transcript>: I've seen this before.

02:26:18
<transcript>: I hate Prisma. Actually, I think I hate prison.

02:26:22
<transcript>: Okay.

02:26:26
<transcript>: Let's restart it.

02:26:34
<transcript>: Empty? What? Why can't I type.

02:26:37
<transcript>: Run, Dev.

02:26:42
<transcript>: Doesn't sound that great. Yeah. What's the worst that could happen here.

02:26:46
<transcript>: I mean, the score could get out, it could get out of sync.

02:26:46
<transcript>: that would be

02:26:48
<transcript>: That would be bad.

02:26:48
<transcript>: it's a

02:26:53
<transcript>: It's a score gets out of sync. Like, what could go wrong with this? Quick.

02:26:57
<transcript>: That's such a dumb thing to say what could go wrong with computers.

02:27:00
woofwoofdude: well do you actually care about consistency ? you might get out of sync at some point if there is some networking problems with the db call. Should also add a .catch if you are going forward with this else you gonna get an unhandle rejection

02:27:02
<transcript>: Let's see if I've worked and if it's faster.

02:27:06
<transcript>: This is Sage Maker Studio lab. Wow. So much faster.

02:27:08
<transcript>: So much faster.

02:27:08
<transcript>: does

02:27:11
<transcript>: Does our score look right, though? Let's see.

02:27:13
<transcript>: It's IQ.

02:27:13
<transcript>: so much

02:27:15
<transcript>: So much faster, now.

02:27:19
<transcript>: Firewall manager.

02:27:23
<transcript>: So it's way, way faster.

02:27:23
<transcript>: turn

02:27:25
<transcript>: Turns out.

02:27:31
<transcript>: Do I even need to do this first query? What am I doing with this query? Yeah, I get the game and I get the round.

02:27:36
<transcript>: Excuse me.

02:27:39
<transcript>: Well, do you actually care about consistency.

02:27:51
<transcript>: I guess. Yeah, I should probably you might get out of sync at some point if there's some networking problems with the BB call should also add a catch. If you're going forward with this else, you're gonna get an unhealthy rejection. Yeah.

02:27:51
<transcript>: yeah let's think

02:27:53
<transcript>: Yeah. Let's think about this.

02:27:57
<transcript>: We're just blindly.

02:27:59
<transcript>: Awaiting promises.

02:27:59
<transcript>: we're not catching

02:28:02
<transcript>: We're not catching any issues that might come from that.

02:28:05
<transcript>: That's going to bite us.

02:28:09
<transcript>: Would Kisley make this faster.

02:28:14
<transcript>: Is this just an A network latency thing? I don't think so.

02:28:14
<transcript>: it

02:28:17
<transcript>: It can be a network latency thing because.

02:28:24
<transcript>: The query would take so much longer. Right? Why does the query only take 150 milliseconds ish.

02:28:24
<transcript>: and the transaction takes

02:28:28
player__piano: https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/opentelemetry-tracing

02:28:33
<transcript>: And the transaction takes 700 milliseconds if it were a network bandwidth issue between the server which is my Dev machine and the database planets go.

02:28:38
<transcript>: Prisma Open. Telemetry tracing.

02:28:44
<transcript>: Copy, link.

02:28:53
<transcript>: I.

02:28:59
<transcript>: See what everything? How long everything takes.

02:29:02
<transcript>: What's it look like.

02:29:05
<transcript>: Oh, it's like got a whole UI and everything.

02:29:05
<transcript>: i have to use

02:29:10
<transcript>: I have to use Gager free, open source Opensolivery Collection, Collector and dashboard.

02:29:16
<transcript>: Let's look like a lot of work.

02:29:16
<transcript>: but

02:29:19
<transcript>: But I guess this would be helpful.

02:29:23
<transcript>: This looks like a lot of work.

02:29:31
player__piano: so much work nvm

02:29:33
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. So I can't just bait. I can't just ignore.

02:29:33
<transcript>: the result

02:29:35
<transcript>: The result of that transaction, can I.

02:29:39
<transcript>: Need to actually handle if there's an issue.

02:29:49
<transcript>: I mean it's a 32nd game. I wonder.

02:29:51
<transcript>: I wonder.

02:29:59
<transcript>: If there's ever an error in your game gets I think maybe you just maybe just the game that game is over.

02:30:01
woofwoofdude: yeah OTLP is a lot of work, but pretty nice to have later

02:30:03
<transcript>: Is that a bad experience? Yeah, that's bad experience.

02:30:07
<transcript>: All to be is a lot of work but pretty nice to have later.

02:30:10
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

02:30:10
<transcript>: let's

02:30:13
<transcript>: Let's let's do a Kisley test because I'm so curious.

02:30:20
<transcript>: I'm so curious how it performs with Kaisely. I don't think it'll take long to kind of get a basic test up with kaisely.

02:30:20
<transcript>: okay

02:30:21
<transcript>: Okay.

02:30:25
<transcript>: So let's do this.

02:30:25
<transcript>: so

02:30:27
<transcript>: So I'm gonna undo these changes.

02:30:31
<transcript>: Because I'm not.

02:30:38
<transcript>: Errors, too. Like as pointed out, we're not doing anything to handle failures. There.

02:30:38
<transcript>: same

02:30:40
<transcript>: Same with all these other.

02:30:47
<transcript>: All these. I'm just blindly awaiting promises without handling.

02:30:47
<transcript>: issues

02:30:49
<transcript>: Issues that may arise.

02:30:54
<transcript>: But let's let's swap in kaisely and let's see if.

02:30:58
<transcript>: It feels faster if it is faster.

02:31:01
<transcript>: So here's Kaisely and Plant scale dialect.

02:31:07
<transcript>: And let's see, we're gonna create a database.

02:31:13
<transcript>: Like this.

02:31:18
<transcript>: Kaisely database. Let's go back over here.

02:31:18
<transcript>: this is

02:31:20
<transcript>: This is we're going to define.

02:31:20
<transcript>: here's

02:31:22
<transcript>: Here's a minimal example.

02:31:36
<transcript>: What is that? Pool dialog. Postgres Dialog. I got ya. So we're gonna have a database. Let's see here's some tables.

02:31:49
<transcript>: Pet table is generated.

02:31:54
<transcript>: Thanks so much for the follow video.

02:31:58
<transcript>: So we're gonna see if we can just recreate this real quick.

02:31:58
<transcript>: i'm

02:32:01
<transcript>: I'm going to.

02:32:04
<transcript>: Do this.

02:32:09
<transcript>: How do I do a V splitting in them? I've only been using pains.

02:32:09
<transcript>: for so

02:32:15
<transcript>: For so long now I do a V split, and in them someone leader.

02:32:21
<transcript>: I mean depends on my mappings, but what's the default if I just say like v no.

02:32:21
<transcript>: i say

02:32:23
raphiledevin: :vs

02:32:25
<transcript>: I say H. It does. No, that's help.

02:32:25
cowfacedude99: :vsp

02:32:27
<transcript>: helpful

02:32:27
<transcript>: Helpful.

02:32:36
<transcript>: How do I do these split? Anybody VST vs even short. Yeah. Perfect. Okay.

02:32:36
<transcript>: let's do

02:32:37
<transcript>: Let's do.

02:32:37
dirk_ickles: ^w^v

02:32:41
<transcript>: Let's open up schema.

02:32:45
<transcript>: I want to have the scheme over here and then we're gonna.

02:32:47
dsstrange: Ctrl+W v

02:32:50
<transcript>: Referential integrity my sequel.

02:32:54
<transcript>: Count.

02:33:01
<transcript>: Session. Oh, there's a lot of stuff in here. I didn't realize for the offpiece, that's unfortunate.

02:33:08
<transcript>: Thank you for everybody. For who told me how to do you all just came through. Thank you.

02:33:08
<transcript>: vsplit

02:33:13
<transcript>: Vsplit. I was like, how do I do this thing and you all you hit me with it. I appreciate that.

02:33:19
<transcript>: Okay. We're not gonna worry about all the this stuff. We're just doing a test right now. We're just trying to see, can I get these basic.

02:33:22
<transcript>: These things.

02:33:23
<transcript>: So.

02:33:26
<transcript>: I get these.

02:33:26
cowfacedude99: if you were opening from telescope, than you could use c-v to open file inside telescope

02:33:34
<transcript>: I don't remember how to navigate my V splits? Oh, yeah, I do.

02:33:36
<transcript>: The control. W.

02:33:36
<transcript>: yeah yeah

02:33:38
<transcript>: Yeah, yeah, okay.

02:33:42
<transcript>: Person we're gonna paste these.

02:33:45
<transcript>: These are just reference.

02:33:53
<transcript>: So we want to have a interface.

02:33:55
<transcript>: Surface.

02:33:55
<transcript>: game

02:33:57
<transcript>: Game table.

02:33:57
<transcript>: is going

02:34:01
<transcript>: Is going to have ID. Does it generated string.

02:34:10
<transcript>: It's got a name, which is a string. It's got rounds which are, oh, can I do that? Can I reference other types.

02:34:16
<transcript>: Which are round so we're gonna have interface round table.

02:34:20
<transcript>: So I guess would that be round.

02:34:27
<transcript>: Round Table. Can I do that? I don't know. I'm not sure yet.

02:34:31
<transcript>: Is that is that possible in kaisely.

02:34:36
<transcript>: Or do I not do that that way.

02:34:56
<transcript>: Do I put the relationships in there like that? Who uses Kaisely? I need a Kaisely expert. I wish DAX were here. If you're opening from Telescope, then you could use Control OCV to open the file.

02:34:56
<transcript>: inside

02:35:06
<transcript>: Inside telescope. Oh, interesting. So I could actually just shoot it into a new VSplit directly from telescope. That's good to know. Thank you, guys. Cafe, how about causing Kaisely face.

02:35:11
<transcript>: Migrations. I'd have to think about migrations.

02:35:19
<transcript>: Okay.

02:35:30
<transcript>: Works in Dino.

02:35:30
<transcript>: in

02:35:31
cowfacedude99: can't you pick the type from prisma or the db directly?

02:35:32
<transcript>: In the browser.

02:35:37
<transcript>: Catch you pick the title from Prisma or the DB directly.

02:35:42
<transcript>: I'm curious. What do you mean by the DB directly.

02:35:45
<transcript>: From the DB directly.

02:35:52
<transcript>: And I don't know. I need to define the Kaisley table types.

02:35:59
<transcript>: And I don't know if I should put rounds on there like that. How do you do relationships.

02:35:59
<transcript>: relation

02:36:01
<transcript>: Relation.

02:36:09
<transcript>: Shippos.

02:36:19
<transcript>: How do I model.

02:36:24
<transcript>: That again. I want to build a fetch the rounds on a game.

02:36:27
<transcript>: You know, I'm saying.

02:36:30
<transcript>: Do I need to be do I need to do that.

02:36:30
<transcript>: inner join

02:36:33
<transcript>: Inner join. Okay, so here's some joins.

02:36:40
<transcript>: So I just write my sequel more manually. Kaisely doesn't do all that stuff. Maybe.

02:36:46
player__piano: do we need an ORM https://planetscale.com/blog/introducing-the-planetscale-serverless-driver-for-javascript

02:36:50
<transcript>: That's the case.

02:36:53
<transcript>: Do we need to know our M.

02:36:53
neochromer: Writing SQL ? Blasphemy

02:36:55
woofwoofdude: skip orms tbh

02:36:56
<transcript>: So player piano, I guess.

02:37:04
<transcript>: Skip or M to be honest, so just write sequel with the Plant Skills serverless driver.

02:37:04
<transcript>: we could do that

02:37:05
<transcript>: We could do that.

02:37:09
<transcript>: We could do that. Actually, let's do that.

02:37:13
<transcript>: We're kaisely sounds nice the TypeScript nature of it, but.

02:37:19
<transcript>: Let's just not let's just write. Let's just use this service driver.

02:37:19
<transcript>: planet

02:37:22
<transcript>: Planet scale serverless driver.

02:37:27
<transcript>: Let's just do it.

02:37:27
<transcript>: where is it

02:37:28
<transcript>: Where is it? On GitHub.

02:37:31
<transcript>: Here it is.

02:37:31
<transcript>: database

02:37:33
cowfacedude99: weren't you thinking of not rewriting awguess? LUL

02:37:40
<transcript>: Database JS Play Scale Davis where we install that we just have configured, we have Connect, and then we're going to write some sequel.

02:37:52
<transcript>: What you think you have not rewriting. Aws, yeah. What I want to do cafes is just figure out, is this a Prisma issue? Is that why that transaction is so slow? If I know the database is not so slow.

02:37:52
<transcript>: then

02:37:54
<transcript>: Then why is.

02:38:03
<transcript>: Why is that taking so long to run that transaction? Is it something Prism is doing is just overhead in Prisma. That's my question.

02:38:08
<transcript>: For questions for question. I guess I could. Yeah, I could just write the sequel.

02:38:12
<transcript>: No. Because then I have to turn it into the can I just write the sequel.

02:38:14
<transcript>: Let's try.

02:38:14
<transcript>: that's

02:38:18
<transcript>: That's a little less work than setting up Kaisely. Probably right.

02:38:24
<transcript>: So I want to.

02:38:24
<transcript>: close that

02:38:27
<transcript>: Close that now I'm just going to delete all this.

02:38:34
woofwoofdude: disclaimer: i've only used mongoose and  hate it :). I feel like orms just always sucks in the end

02:38:40
<transcript>: I'm just gonna delete all this.

02:38:48
<transcript>: All this. All this. All. Okay, let's go back to.

02:38:52
<transcript>: Our file. Now we can just interact directly with.

02:38:55
<transcript>: Db.

02:38:58
<transcript>: Router, game, router.

02:38:58
<transcript>: so

02:39:03
<transcript>: So here I'm just going to use the serverless driver instead of Prisma. And we're gonna see if that's faster.

02:39:07
<transcript>: And I just need to write one of these. I could just write the.

02:39:11
<transcript>: Prison transaction.

02:39:17
<transcript>: I want to write these manually. Yeah.

02:39:23
<transcript>: Disclaimer. I've only used mongoose and hate it. I feel like Orange just always sucks. In the end.

02:39:29
<transcript>: Yeah, all I care about right now is Is it faster if I write this sequel directly.

02:39:31
<transcript>: And that's all I care about.

02:39:31
<transcript>: so

02:39:33
<transcript>: So let's see.

02:39:36
<transcript>: Import connect from plant scale database.

02:39:47
<transcript>: Does that need to be? This is what that warning was, isn't it.

02:39:53
<transcript>: Here's. Your source is from. Yeah, I think it's just like that.

02:39:57
<transcript>: Okay, connect from Planet Scale database.

02:40:03
<transcript>: We're gonna come in here, and we're just gonna rewrite this one query.

02:40:03
<transcript>: actually

02:40:05
woofwoofdude: Why don't you just make 2 simpler script to test that out instead of changing everything

02:40:06
<transcript>: Actually, this will be a lot easier to rewrite this one.

02:40:08
<transcript>: Calling me.

02:40:22
<transcript>: Let's see. I'm gonna rewrite this one just so much faster. It normally takes about a 150 milliseconds. Let's see if it shades off anytime at all by doing it.

02:40:24
<transcript>: With this thing right here.

02:40:24
<transcript>: so

02:40:25
<transcript>: So connect.

02:40:32
<transcript>: Like this. I guess the connection. Would it happen.

02:40:37
<transcript>: Would the connection happen.

02:40:40
<transcript>: I just need a URL.

02:40:40
<transcript>: like this

02:40:41
<transcript>: Like this.

02:40:50
<transcript>: What.

02:40:52
<transcript>: I just do to my buffer.

02:40:55
<transcript>: Okay.

02:40:55
<transcript>: config you

02:40:58
<transcript>: Config you are L processing Davis URIL.

02:41:02
<transcript>: Is that already what it is called.

02:41:07
<transcript>: Where did I see that? Where is that happening.

02:41:18
<transcript>: Yeah. Right here. Okay.

02:41:26
<transcript>: So we've got config that's our URL. We connect.

02:41:26
<transcript>: do i need

02:41:30
<transcript>: Do I need to do the connection outside of this? Probably.

02:41:37
<transcript>: Connection. Execute. Select one from dual. Okay, so we're gonna rewrite this query right here.

02:41:43
<transcript>: Like right here. What's that one.

02:41:45
<transcript>: What is that.

02:41:51
<transcript>: What are they passing? A one in there for.

02:41:54
<transcript>: I guess I should look at the signature.

02:42:00
<transcript>: Args outside the ARGs in like that. Okay.

02:42:03
<transcript>: Where one equals a question Mark is an Arg.

02:42:03
<transcript>: okay

02:42:05
<transcript>: Okay.

02:42:09
<transcript>: So we're gonna do Select.

02:42:11
<transcript>: All from.

02:42:11
<transcript>: what

02:42:14
<transcript>: What does this query doing? It's doing.

02:42:14
<transcript>: where id

02:42:15
player__piano: can we copy paste from planetscale history

02:42:15
<transcript>: Where ID. Round ID.

02:42:15
<transcript>: includes

02:42:18
<transcript>: Includes doing a join and including the game.

02:42:18
<transcript>: because

02:42:24
<transcript>: Because I need the expires from game. Okay, so select all from.

02:42:28
<transcript>: Round.

02:42:31
<transcript>: Rounds. What's the table called.

02:42:33
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:42:40
<transcript>: Seven tables.

02:42:43
<transcript>: Table round.

02:42:50
<transcript>: As R.

02:42:53
<transcript>: How you do that when you do join.

02:42:53
<transcript>: it's just

02:42:56
<transcript>: It's just a long since I've written Raw sequel.

02:43:02
<transcript>: Can we copy paste from Plantscale history? Oh, good question, player. Piano. That's a great idea.

02:43:04
<transcript>: That's a great idea.

02:43:08
<transcript>: I should never program alone.

02:43:08
<transcript>: switch that

02:43:10
<transcript>: Switch that saves me like hours every day.

02:43:10
<transcript>: eight of you guess

02:43:12
<transcript>: Eight of you guess.

02:43:15
<transcript>: Insights. Where do I see.

02:43:17
<transcript>: Here we go.

02:43:17
<transcript>: insert

02:43:20
<transcript>: Insert into select. Let's see.

02:43:33
<transcript>: How do I see what I'm looking for? Or how do I find what I'm looking for? Insert into Select.

02:43:40
<transcript>: Is this where I would find it in the insights.

02:43:45
<transcript>: Oh, Brandches, I need to go into my branch. Yeah. Here we go.

02:43:45
<transcript>: console

02:43:46
<transcript>: Console.

02:43:46
<transcript>: is this

02:43:50
<transcript>: Is this gonna show it when I run it? Let's do, let's do this.

02:43:58
<transcript>: Try this so.

02:44:06
<transcript>: Let's see. I think this is going to just print everything that happens, right.

02:44:06
<transcript>: or maybe

02:44:09
<transcript>: Or maybe not why don't you just make.

02:44:09
<transcript>: two

02:44:12
<transcript>: Two simpler scripts to test that out. Instead of changing everything.

02:44:17
<transcript>: Yeah, I guess I could have just done it in a script.

02:44:19
<transcript>: But we're kind of here now.

02:44:22
<transcript>: New game.

02:44:27
<transcript>: Does this how it's like the easiest one ever.

02:44:32
<transcript>: Does this write? Anything? No. Where do I see queries that are happening.

02:44:36
<transcript>: How do I watch? Queries.

02:44:43
<transcript>: Anybody now is that a thing I can do.

02:44:46
<transcript>: Is it just insights.

02:44:46
<transcript>: queries

02:44:48
<transcript>: Queries are in the last 24 hours.

02:44:59
<transcript>: Oh, branch. X eight. Here we go. I was on the wrong branch. There we go. Update. Select, round out it. Here it is. This is the query.

02:45:02
<transcript>: Is it is it.

02:45:06
<transcript>: Round ID. No, this is not it.

02:45:09
<transcript>: Right.

02:45:14
<transcript>: Select.

02:45:24
<transcript>: Is that it? That's not the whole query. Right.

02:45:24
<transcript>: there's

02:45:27
<transcript>: There's some kind of like subquery that I don't understand.

02:45:27
<transcript>: here

02:45:29
<transcript>: Here, either. This one.

02:45:30
aaaaliou: Hey Adam! Hey chat!

02:45:33
<transcript>: So this one limit Asset round ID.

02:45:38
<transcript>: It's not joining on the game.

02:45:42
<transcript>: Hey.

02:45:42
<transcript>: aloo

02:45:44
<transcript>: Aloo, what's going on.

02:45:47
<transcript>: What's going on.

02:45:57
<transcript>: Okay. Can I like look at the last.

02:46:04
<transcript>: Want to look at the last. Not the last. Yeah. Choose a timeframe. We just want to look at like these.

02:46:05
<transcript>: Even less.

02:46:09
<transcript>: Someone look at the last few seconds.

02:46:11
<transcript>: I'm gonna just like, tail it.

02:46:11
<transcript>: from

02:46:14
<transcript>: From 820 to 830.

02:46:25
<transcript>: Queries.

02:46:27
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:46:39
<transcript>: I don't know what the parameter values are.

02:46:44
<transcript>: I just want to watch. Like.

02:46:47
<transcript>: The last few right.

02:46:56
<transcript>: Oh, if I click on these, is it? No. Now it's just performance. This chart is unrelated to the table, isn't it.

02:46:59
<transcript>: Okay.

02:47:11
<transcript>: So it's something like one of these. But that's these aren't it? I don't know what it's constructing several queries to do, what I'm trying to do here, I guess.

02:47:13
<transcript>: Oh, here we go.

02:47:15
<transcript>: Can I do when it happens.

02:47:20
<transcript>: Last run? Here we go, here we go here we go last run.

02:47:23
<transcript>: Is that what I want.

02:47:27
<transcript>: 1117. 828. 37 okay.

02:47:31
<transcript>: Update.

02:47:31
<transcript>: game

02:47:35
<transcript>: Game set score. Okay, that looks like Game activity.

02:47:39
<transcript>: No, I gotta redo.

02:47:39
<transcript>: last

02:47:42
<transcript>: Last run. I will do table as well.

02:47:42
<transcript>: and then

02:47:43
<transcript>: And then.

02:47:45
<transcript>: Here we go.

02:47:50
<transcript>: Table Dual round insert.

02:47:55
<transcript>: Select from Game table. Select from Roundtable. Here it is Here it is.

02:47:55
<transcript>: let's just do this

02:47:56
<transcript>: Let's just do this.

02:48:04
<transcript>: See, I think part of the problem is like the stuff it's doing with the database may not be.

02:48:04
<transcript>: what we

02:48:05
<transcript>: What we want to do.

02:48:05
<transcript>: it might be inefficient

02:48:11
<transcript>: It might be inefficiently querying to support this whole Orm functionality. I don't know.

02:48:37
<transcript>: Okay.

02:48:45
<transcript>: We have we're not gonna do a limit. I mean, it's just a it's. Well, I guess I could limit it to one. Right.

02:48:50
<transcript>: Limit.

02:48:53
<transcript>: Offset let's just do limit.

02:49:00
<transcript>: It's a question Mark. Is what you do for AMS. Is that right.

02:49:02
<transcript>: And then.

02:49:05
<transcript>: Offset to row count. I just want to limit.

02:49:08
<transcript>: I don't know. Is this gonna even work.

02:49:08
<transcript>: limit to

02:49:10
<transcript>: Limit to one.

02:49:15
<transcript>: I guess it'd be zero to one, right.

02:49:17
<transcript>: Is this how this works.

02:49:20
dnbull: :O

02:49:22
<transcript>: Two question marks. And then I just say zero to one.

02:49:24
<transcript>: Select.

02:49:26
<transcript>: Round ID.

02:49:31
<transcript>: Round ID or Game ID. Answer.

02:49:36
<transcript>: Who thinks this is gonna work.

02:49:41
<transcript>: And start round end round choice.

02:49:50
<transcript>: Id. And then we have to this is going to be.

02:49:55
<transcript>: Another one of these params.

02:49:55
<transcript>: round id

02:49:57
<transcript>: Round ID equals something.

02:49:57
<transcript>: i need to say

02:50:01
<transcript>: I need to say with the round ID is it's.

02:50:03
<transcript>: A Round ID.

02:50:05
<transcript>: Right. Oh, it's right here.

02:50:10
<transcript>: Who thinks this is gonna work? I don't know.

02:50:10
<transcript>: results

02:50:14
<transcript>: Results and then let's log the results.

02:50:17
<transcript>: Let's see what's like.

02:50:26
<transcript>: Dm. Bowls. Here. The Embol looks sad or surprised or something.

02:50:26
<transcript>: oh the

02:50:30
<transcript>: Oh, the Chromo key. Yeah, bad hair day doesn't work so well.

02:50:30
<transcript>: with my

02:50:35
dnbull: hehe hope all is well!

02:50:36
<transcript>: With my Chroma key for some reason, I don't really understand with it. I don't understand why.

02:50:41
<transcript>: Hope I was well, it is going well. Taylor's. Here.

02:50:41
<transcript>: put murray band

02:50:43
<transcript>: Put Murray Bands on me.

02:50:43
<transcript>: okay let's try this

02:50:44
<transcript>: Okay, let's try this.

02:50:44
<transcript>: i don't think it's

02:50:47
<transcript>: I don't think it's gonna actually work actually.

02:50:52
<transcript>: We're gonna see if we got the plant scale serverless driver working.

02:50:52
<transcript>: that's all we're trying to figure

02:50:54
<transcript>: That's all we're trying to figure out.

02:50:54
<transcript>: so am

02:50:56
<transcript>: So amplify. That is.

02:50:56
<transcript>: not work

02:51:00
<transcript>: Not work. Make sure fused.

02:51:09
<transcript>: So PlanetScale do it's. Trying to cut. I was trying to call one hundred and twenty seven. Zero to zero one. Wait, that's. That's correct.

02:51:09
<transcript>: that's

02:51:12
<transcript>: That's where we have the proxy running right.

02:51:19
<transcript>: Can I connect to our proxy.

02:51:26
<transcript>: It's so slow, I'm so slow.

02:51:36
<transcript>: Why can't I connect.

02:51:36
<transcript>: to the

02:51:37
<transcript>: To the.

02:51:42
<transcript>: Proxy.

02:52:05
<transcript>: Oh, maybe maybe it doesn't work with the product. Maybe the serverless driver doesn't work.

02:52:20
<transcript>: What.

02:52:25
<transcript>: Doesn't work.

02:52:30
<transcript>: With the proxy.

02:52:37
<transcript>: We'll think about this.

02:52:37
<transcript>: what's what's actually

02:52:44
<transcript>: What's? What's actually going on here? So we're trying to connect with database URL. Should I just print the database URL real quick.

02:52:51
<transcript>: That connection is failing.

02:53:12
<transcript>: Oh, wait. It's trying to do it on https. Is that. Is that how it's been working the plant skill proxy thing.

02:53:20
<transcript>: Down here.

02:53:20
<transcript>: local

02:53:27
<transcript>: Local address to connect your application 102 713-3090 it's not the Port in there.

02:53:29
<transcript>: Is that the problem.

02:53:33
<transcript>: Is trying to connect on four, four, three. Is that the problem.

02:53:35
<transcript>: Maybe.

02:53:38
<transcript>: A lot of things I don't understand right now.

02:53:38
<transcript>: consol

02:53:42
<transcript>: Console log, URL.

02:53:46
<transcript>: Oh no.

02:53:46
<transcript>: process

02:53:47
<transcript>: Process.

02:53:47
<transcript>: in

02:53:49
<transcript>: In Database, URL.

02:53:52
<transcript>: Okay.

02:53:54
<transcript>: Didn't mean to do that.

02:54:00
<transcript>: And to do this.

02:54:11
<transcript>: Okay.

02:54:17
<transcript>: 33, nine. Aw, guess.

02:54:24
<transcript>: So that looks fine. I guess.

02:54:24
<transcript>: but the

02:54:28
<transcript>: But the serverless driver is trying to hit the serverless driver.

02:54:33
<transcript>: Request to alright I'm gonna take break and think about this.

02:54:33
<transcript>: i'm not really sure

02:54:34
<transcript>: I'm not really sure.

02:54:36
<transcript>: What I was.

02:54:36
<transcript>: gonna take

02:54:38
<transcript>: Gonna take a quick break.

02:54:42
<transcript>: Oh, that's our own button.

02:55:09
<transcript>: I hit the wrong button.

03:09:44
<transcript>: Alright.

03:09:44
<transcript>: so i thought

03:09:47
<transcript>: So I thought about this more and.

03:09:48
allcliffs: @adamdotdev hey I've sent you twitch pm with a solution for your linear gradients :) take a look

03:10:01
<transcript>: I don't think I'm gonna work performance right now. All cliffs have seen you Twitch P. M. With the solution for your linear gradients. I saw it all cliffs and I wanted to tell you face to face, face to avatar.

03:10:06
<transcript>: We actually I took a totally different approach this morning. Built in.

03:10:06
<transcript>: stream

03:10:08
<transcript>: Stream.

03:10:12
<transcript>: Basically what we're doing now. Thank you for the follow cloudbe.

03:10:12
<transcript>: what i'm doing

03:10:15
dnbull: ohhh i see that nike :D

03:10:17
<transcript>: What I'm doing now I realize like all these Sugs have like 80%.

03:10:17
<transcript>: they're all the same

03:10:21
<transcript>: They're all the same content. There's two things that change.

03:10:25
<transcript>: The envelope. See that? Nike? Yeah.

03:10:25
<transcript>: there's two things

03:10:30
<transcript>: There's two things that change the gradient stops the color stops. So six characters.

03:10:33
<transcript>: Times. 212 characters.

03:10:42
<transcript>: And then the past data for the D in the main. Like the main path data that makes up the shape. So I'm just sending those.

03:10:42
<transcript>: just those

03:10:44
<transcript>: Just those two pieces of information.

03:10:44
<transcript>: in

03:10:47
<transcript>: In every new round.

03:10:47
<transcript>: so the payload

03:11:00
<transcript>: So the payload ends up a kilobyte and a half instead of sending one big 1 MB SVG Sprite at the beginning, we just send it incrementally as you so we're not cashing those Sugs. That's the downside, but it's pretty fast.

03:11:00
<transcript>: and

03:11:09
<transcript>: And it doesn't have any issues on any of the browsers. So I took kind of a different approach. As I stepped away yesterday, I thought through it more, and I realized like it's pretty inefficient when I'm doing.

03:11:09
<transcript>: that sugar

03:11:15
<transcript>: That sugar Sprite is full of just like repetitive sugar plate.

03:11:15
<transcript>: and i

03:11:24
<transcript>: And I could just make it a lot more minimal and efficient. So that's what we did. But then thank you for seeing that solution. I'm sure that would have worked as well if I wanted to keep going on the SUG Sprite route.

03:11:24
<transcript>: but shower

03:11:27
<transcript>: But shower thoughts last night I realized I don't really want to do that.

03:11:27
<transcript>: and

03:11:35
<transcript>: And just now, I realized I don't really want to do any performance optimization. We got too many features to build. I hope it's gonna be.

03:11:50
allcliffs: most gradients were -45, but there was 1 gradient was +45

03:11:53
<transcript>: Fast enough for people to play with it and not hate it. But I am testing locally. Maybe when I deploy to Versaille, maybe it'll be in the same region as plant scale. Maybe it would be faster. I don't know. We're gonna hope it's not terrible, but I probably should focus more on actually shipping some features because I have a lot of them. I want to ship.

03:11:57
<transcript>: Oh, awkless.

03:12:02
<transcript>: You're telling me there was one of the gradients was the other direction.

03:12:09
<transcript>: Interesting. I did not realize that so good. Good call out. Maybe I'll find that one.

03:12:09
<transcript>: and

03:12:15
<transcript>: And we will handle that separately. So let's just start deleting stuff.

03:12:17
<transcript>: Like all this.

03:12:19
<transcript>: And.

03:12:19
<transcript>: this

03:12:21
<transcript>: This.

03:12:26
<transcript>: We're going rid of all the plan scale stuff.

03:12:29
<transcript>: I will leave this timing stuff in there for now.

03:12:34
<transcript>: No planet skill let's go package JSON.

03:12:38
allcliffs: it was the 1779bb13d0d8f098504e6d87a837e338_a

03:12:41
<transcript>: We have options. If things are too slow, we could do kaisely.

03:12:48
<transcript>: And see if that's faster. We could use the serverless driver, see if that's faster. We could just use DynamoDB.

03:12:48
<transcript>: and say

03:12:51
<transcript>: And say, Screw it all.

03:12:53
<transcript>: Okay.

03:12:59
<transcript>: I'm just gonna do that. I know there's a term anymore, but I want to just remove those dependencies, okay.

03:12:59
<transcript>: and let's

03:13:02
<transcript>: And let's go to our database, client.

03:13:06
<transcript>: Do anything in here. I just changed the logging. Okay.

03:13:10
<transcript>: Cool, cool.

03:13:16
<transcript>: Looks go back into our server so.

03:13:16
<transcript>: i guess

03:13:17
<transcript>: I guess for our index.

03:13:27
<transcript>: Did we do it? Did we get rid of all the yeah. So now we're ready to build some new features. We need to work in the front end a bit because it's been neglected.

03:13:31
<transcript>: Let's do PMP, run Dev.

03:13:38
<transcript>: It was the. Oh, thank you so much. All. Cliff. So you're telling me that one right there.

03:13:38
<transcript>: had

03:13:40
<transcript>: Had a reverse gradient.

03:13:50
<transcript>: Let's take a look.

03:13:59
<transcript>: One, seven, seven.

03:14:06
<transcript>: Where is it.

03:14:10
<transcript>: Shorted. They weren't.

03:14:18
<transcript>: One, seven, seven.

03:14:21
<transcript>: I don't see a 107.

03:14:38
<transcript>: And you're referring to the gradient name. I wonder if there's some reason to be different.

03:14:48
<transcript>: Can you see what it looks like? Like what the image looked like, and send that to me.

03:14:50
<transcript>: Somehow.

03:14:54
<transcript>: Because I don't see any.

03:14:54
<transcript>: of the hash

03:14:58
<transcript>: Of the hashes that start with 1770h. Wait, wait.

03:15:02
<transcript>: How are these not sorted ones? I don't know how sorting works.

03:15:06
<transcript>: Here we go. One, seven, five.

03:15:08
<transcript>: 17777. Seven. Here we go.

03:15:11
<transcript>: Nine BB. This is the one.

03:15:15
<transcript>: So that gradient is the opposite.

03:15:24
<transcript>: Are you sure.

03:15:31
<transcript>: Visually, it looks the same like the dark corners down here and then light corner top, right.

03:15:36
<transcript>: It does look at the SDS. Different.

03:15:37
cowfacedude99: all while I am looking at the search button LUL

03:15:44
<transcript>: All I'm looking at the search button.

03:15:49
<transcript>: I could have searched for one, seven, seven, yeah, Yeah.

03:15:49
<transcript>: i cut i guess

03:16:01
<transcript>: I cut. I guess I could have done that. I don't like Mac search. I just don't. I don't know why. It feels like maybe it's gotten better, but it used to, like, default to the wrong place. It felt like it was like defaulting to the whole machine or something. I don't know. I just have always hated it.

03:16:04
<transcript>: Okay.

03:16:08
<transcript>: So if we do new game.

03:16:08
<transcript>: but slow right now

03:16:10
<transcript>: But slow right now.

03:16:12
<transcript>: That's really slow.

03:16:12
<transcript>: but

03:16:14
<transcript>: But we're gonna live with it.

03:16:19
<transcript>: Let's work on. Okay. So in the game router.

03:16:24
<transcript>: Let's see there's somewhere where, yeah, here.

03:16:34
<transcript>: We 30 seconds. Actually, I'm gonna make it 45 seconds. I think that's a sweet spot. I don't want it to be a whole minute.

03:16:35
<transcript>: But.

03:16:39
<transcript>: I do think I.

03:16:39
<transcript>: too short

03:16:40
<transcript>: Too short.

03:16:44
<transcript>: Also think I might tweak the timing of like.

03:16:44
<transcript>: leaves

03:16:48
<transcript>: Leaves for missing a question versus getting one right.

03:16:52
<transcript>: Well, that stuff is easy to tweak as we go.

03:16:52
<transcript>: i

03:16:56
<transcript>: I want to visual. I want to work on some of the visuals. This is terrible.

03:17:04
<transcript>: So we're gonna have, like, little circles in the corners that are like your score and your streak and stuff like that. We're gonna do some animations.

03:17:04
<transcript>: this is

03:17:10
<transcript>: This is something defendered? Iot device defender? No trust advisor. Oh, Oops.

03:17:10
cowfacedude99: that's why I explore folders with ls and tree. and use cat and feh for looking at files and images.

03:17:18
<transcript>: I don't know. This is either managed boxing.

03:17:18
<transcript>: managers are

03:17:19
<transcript>: Managers are okay.

03:17:21
<transcript>: Terrible start.

03:17:24
<transcript>: Am I gonna get a zero.

03:17:24
<transcript>: a zero

03:17:27
<transcript>: A zero of shame chime. I don't know. Got it.

03:17:37
<transcript>: That's why I explore folders with LS and tree and use cat and FH for looking at files and images. Y'all don't know why I still open Explorer for stuff.

03:17:39
<transcript>: Like that. Says something about me.

03:17:45
<transcript>: Having in this case is I wanted to look at the file.

03:17:45
<transcript>: in preview

03:17:48
<transcript>: In Preview. How would I do that? From.

03:17:55
cowfacedude99: it is your muscle memory.

03:17:58
<transcript>: Still a soy developer at heart.

03:17:58
<transcript>: i'm still

03:18:00
<transcript>: I'm still a Mac user.

03:18:06
<transcript>: My muscle memory. Yeah, that makes sense.

03:18:10
<transcript>: Okay.

03:18:10
<transcript>: let's impro

03:18:12
<transcript>: Let's improve some stuff.

03:18:18
<transcript>: So here.

03:18:21
<transcript>: These are not gonna be like this.

03:18:21
<transcript>: we're gonna do

03:18:23
<transcript>: We're gonna do give.

03:18:31
<transcript>: A really bad timer a really bad time.

03:18:34
<transcript>: To make my timer short again.

03:18:37
<transcript>: When I just need to visualize this.

03:18:41
<transcript>: Yeah I'm gonna have to.

03:18:52
<transcript>: There's no. 30. Oh, I change it to 45.

03:18:57
<transcript>: What.

03:19:13
<transcript>: We should be able to have a long timer.

03:19:16
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

03:19:19
<transcript>: What happened.

03:19:21
<transcript>: Here we go.

03:19:25
<transcript>: So this is gonna be a Div class name.

03:19:26
<transcript>: Absolute.

03:19:29
<transcript>: No actually.

03:19:29
<transcript>: we're

03:19:32
<transcript>: We're gonna put this down here.

03:19:35
<transcript>: Let's see, how do I do this.

03:19:35
<transcript>: this

03:19:36
cowfacedude99: that's maybe why I moved on from filetree early on. didn't like it in vscode and once I got a hang of telescope, didn't need it inside vim

03:19:37
<transcript>: This is a Div.

03:19:49
<transcript>: That's gonna have the score in here.

03:19:49
<transcript>: is it rest

03:19:52
<transcript>: Is it restarting the game every time I save the file.

03:19:52
<transcript>: that's a bummer

03:19:54
<transcript>: That's a bummer.

03:19:59
<transcript>: No, let's do the seconds first.

03:20:02
<transcript>: That's a bummer.

03:20:02
<transcript>: why is the

03:20:03
<transcript>: Why is the.

03:20:05
<transcript>: Oh Oops.

03:20:19
<transcript>: Absolute we're gonna say top.

03:20:19
<transcript>: zero

03:20:20
<transcript>: Zero, right.

03:20:24
<transcript>: So we're gonna say negative.

03:20:32
<transcript>: Okay.

03:20:37
<transcript>: Where's the timer.

03:20:40
<transcript>: Where is it.

03:20:42
<transcript>: This needs to be relative.

03:20:47
<transcript>: relatively so annoying

03:20:47
<transcript>: relatively so annoying okay

03:20:49
<transcript>: Relatively so annoying. Okay, I gotta fix this.

03:20:52
<transcript>: How do I do that? How do we want to.

03:21:06
<transcript>: That's maybe why I moved on from file tree early on. Didn't like it in vs. Code, and once I got a hang of telescope didn't need it inside them. Yeah, I use envym tree too much. I do.

03:21:06
<transcript>: i shouldn't

03:21:08
<transcript>: I shouldn't.

03:21:15
<transcript>: I don't need it. I don't know why I use it.

03:21:22
<transcript>: So I can I make this knot.

03:21:26
<transcript>: Just do like a fake.

03:21:29
<transcript>: See.

03:21:35
<transcript>: Like a fake game for now.

03:21:50
<transcript>: Like this.

03:21:58
<transcript>: Grab one.

03:22:10
<transcript>: It's gonna be shaped like this, isn't it? Oh, here we go.

03:22:16
<transcript>: Copy, object.

03:22:28
<transcript>: What is this? So.

03:22:35
<transcript>: Why is this not valid JavaScript.

03:22:38
<transcript>: Something up here.

03:22:52
<transcript>: We go.

03:23:02
<transcript>: There's our round the game ID has an answer.

03:23:09
<transcript>: Else I need to put in here the game.

03:23:17
<transcript>: Right.

03:23:17
cowfacedude99: I think it is pretty convenient for creating files but I have gotten a habit of using tmux and touch to create files.

03:23:25
<transcript>: What am I looking for? Game new. Here we go.

03:23:33
<transcript>: So here is the game.

03:23:41
<transcript>: That work.

03:23:44
<transcript>: Spires.

03:23:50
<transcript>: Let me get a long ways away.

03:23:57
<transcript>: But why? Is that not working.

03:24:00
<transcript>: Const current.

03:24:04
<transcript>: Does it need to be curved.

03:24:14
<transcript>: We were rendering. Then here context choice.

03:24:21
<transcript>: Okay so current matches active.

03:24:29
<transcript>: And do this.

03:24:33
<transcript>: Am I gonna regret this? I don't know.

03:24:37
<transcript>: Just trying to get a state where I can make changes.

03:24:37
<transcript>: and visually

03:24:40
<transcript>: And visually update this thing.

03:24:43
<transcript>: I think this works. I think I did it.

03:24:46
<transcript>: It's a bit weird.

03:24:52
<transcript>: And I have to remember to come back and fix that. Maybe I should actually.

03:24:59
<transcript>: Something recently.

03:25:07
<transcript>: Has made that a very bad experience. Okay. So current active. So maybe I could just make current manage active somehow.

03:25:20
<transcript>: I hate that every time I save the thing.

03:25:23
<transcript>: It's repainting the page.

03:25:23
<transcript>: it's restarting over

03:25:24
<transcript>: It's restarting over.

03:25:28
<transcript>: I avoid that without all this work.

03:25:36
<transcript>: Maybe I can't maybe.

03:25:43
<transcript>: I want to remember that I need to redo this.

03:25:52
<transcript>: Current matches.

03:26:11
<transcript>: We can just ignore the button and I can style it now. I think.

03:26:14
<transcript>: Let's make this better.

03:26:14
<transcript>: let's see

03:26:19
<transcript>: Let's see. There's needs to be a choice. I guess. Context, result.

03:26:19
<transcript>: will

03:26:29
<transcript>: Will style that stuff in a bit, but for now, I'm just gonna let's just style the other stuff. So we put that up there in the top, right? I'm actually gonna remove seconds.

03:26:33
<transcript>: We're just gonna have the number in a circle.

03:26:36
<transcript>: I don't want to do that. I want to.

03:26:43
<transcript>: I think it's pretty convenient for Cringing files, but I've gotten a habit of using tmux and Touch to create files. See, I should do that kind of stuff.

03:26:49
<transcript>: Thanks so much for the follow. Emerson.

03:26:51
<transcript>: I miss that earlier.

03:26:58
<transcript>: So let's see.

03:27:02
<transcript>: I want to make a circle.

03:27:02
<transcript>: this is my

03:27:06
<transcript>: This is my absolute top right? So this thing could be the circle. It could have a background.

03:27:06
<transcript>: orange

03:27:09
<transcript>: Orange, nine.

03:27:10
<transcript>: And it could have.

03:27:10
<transcript>: rounded

03:27:12
<transcript>: Rounded.

03:27:12
<transcript>: full

03:27:13
<transcript>: Full.

03:27:16
<transcript>: And it needs to have the same width.

03:27:22
<transcript>: As height. Let's just give it a fixed width. Let's say width.

03:27:22
<transcript>: twelve

03:27:25
<transcript>: Twelve, height, twelve.

03:27:27
<transcript>: Circle like that.

03:27:32
<transcript>: And then what else.

03:27:32
<transcript>: then the

03:27:38
<transcript>: Then the number. Okay, so then let's make it Flex Items Center.

03:27:38
<transcript>: justifies

03:27:43
<transcript>: Justifies center. And then this.

03:27:43
<transcript>: we need to make

03:27:44
<transcript>: We need to make white.

03:27:50
<transcript>: Oh.

03:27:51
<transcript>: White.

03:27:54
<transcript>: Just like that.

03:27:58
<transcript>: Text, large.

03:28:01
<transcript>: It's pretty good, right.

03:28:07
<transcript>: Second.

03:28:22
<transcript>: Be like a big number if you just like, we're killing it with the game. And you were getting all the right answers. You could increase that over into three digits.

03:28:22
<transcript>: and that's

03:28:23
<transcript>: And that's what that would look like.

03:28:27
<transcript>: That's fine. Okay.

03:28:47
<transcript>: We're gonna work on the color scheme. I'm not crazy about the Orange and blue. It's. I was trying to go Amazon colors, but I don't know. We'll probably change that some way, but that's how we can do that. Just like a number up there in the corner. I could have, like, a border that's, like, erasing as the timer's ticking. You know, like a clock. Looks like a clock. We could do that. I'm not gonna do it just yet.

03:28:47
<transcript>: so

03:28:49
<transcript>: So let's see.

03:28:57
<transcript>: Okay. Nickel Creek is coming off of playlist. I'm never into it. I'm actually kind of tired of taking this there, too.

03:28:57
<transcript>: i guess

03:29:00
<transcript>: I guess something else. What else? We got.

03:29:00
<transcript>: probably

03:29:02
<transcript>: Probably. Tigers. Okay.

03:29:06
<transcript>: So that's the timer. Let's put.

03:29:06
<transcript>: a similar thing

03:29:08
<transcript>: A similar thing.

03:29:11
<transcript>: Let's do a similar thing.

03:29:11
<transcript>: for

03:29:12
<transcript>: For.

03:29:12
<transcript>: the

03:29:13
<transcript>: The.

03:29:18
<transcript>: Top, and then this will be less.

03:29:26
<transcript>: Five. So we're gonna put one over here. This is gonna be the.

03:29:27
<transcript>: Score.

03:29:32
<transcript>: I guess score should probably go.

03:29:32
<transcript>: in the top

03:29:33
<transcript>: In the top.

03:29:33
<transcript>: right

03:29:36
<transcript>: Right and timers be on the top. Left.

03:29:39
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the follow.

03:29:39
<transcript>: real

03:29:42
<transcript>: Real King Philip.

03:29:44
<transcript>: So let's do this.

03:29:48
<transcript>: Seconds. And then this one's gonna be scored.

03:29:52
<transcript>: Context.

03:29:52
<transcript>: game

03:29:53
<transcript>: Game.

03:29:53
<transcript>: store

03:29:54
realkingphilippe: OhMyDog

03:29:54
<transcript>: Store.

03:29:54
<transcript>: okay

03:29:56
<transcript>: Okay.

03:29:56
<transcript>: so that's

03:30:00
<transcript>: So that's our score in the top right. That's the timer on the top left.

03:30:07
<transcript>: And then the streak. Do we want to actually show the streak.

03:30:10
<transcript>: I don't want to do the streak.

03:30:14
<transcript>: We could do it in the bottom, right. Welcome to Chat. Real King Phillip.

03:30:21
<transcript>: Oh, my dog. Oh, my dog. What is this? Emote.

03:30:24
<transcript>: Thanks. It's about Craig. Oh.

03:30:28
delvoid: Heyoooo buddy

03:30:32
<transcript>: Okay, let's see.

03:30:38
<transcript>: What just happened? 40.

03:30:41
<transcript>: Pixels.

03:30:50
<transcript>: I don't know if I want to show the streak no voids here hey oh, boy.

03:30:50
<transcript>: i don't know if

03:30:54
<transcript>: I don't know if I want to show the streak visually anywhere.

03:30:54
<transcript>: you're just gonna

03:31:01
<transcript>: You're just gonna see every time you get points. Maybe we should animate the increase of the points. That might be a cool thing to do.

03:31:03
<transcript>: That'd be cool.

03:31:05
<transcript>: Let's.

03:31:08
<transcript>: Go back up here.

03:31:23
<transcript>: Okay current matches active.

03:31:26
<transcript>: And that.

03:31:28
<transcript>: And let's go back up here.

03:31:35
<transcript>: We're Let's.

03:31:36
<transcript>: Hope.

03:31:46
<transcript>: It back together again. Okay.

03:31:49
<transcript>: Let's see what that looks like new game.

03:31:53
<transcript>: So there's our timer ticking down.

03:31:58
<transcript>: There's our score. So if we get this right.

03:32:04
<transcript>: The audit manager that's look out for equipment. Oops. Okay, so that streak. We want to not show that streak.

03:32:13
<transcript>: Nothing like a layout shift. And that's just terrible.

03:32:13
<transcript>: okay

03:32:16
<transcript>: Okay. A three simple sort of service.

03:32:16
<transcript>: so

03:32:19
<transcript>: So there we got points.

03:32:19
<transcript>: how do i get

03:32:23
<transcript>: How do I get two points for that? Why did I get two points for that one? I don't know.

03:32:25
<transcript>: This is.

03:32:28
<transcript>: Code Guru, what is this.

03:32:34
<transcript>: Actually don't have any idea elemental appliances inside software.

03:32:38
<transcript>: What is the strict connect Proton.

03:32:45
<transcript>: So we're getting our score is Ingram. I think we need to visualize that with, like.

03:32:48
<transcript>: An animation of some sort that's Kinesis Data analytics.

03:32:52
<transcript>: That needs to show like a plus three plus four plus whatever.

03:32:54
<transcript>: And.

03:32:54
<transcript>: what else

03:32:56
<transcript>: What else.

03:33:01
<transcript>: Comprehend lumber. Yar, what is this one? Comprehend.

03:33:04
uberrick: Hey Adam!

03:33:06
<transcript>: The timer.

03:33:06
<transcript>: how can we make

03:33:10
<transcript>: How can we make the timer better? Rick is here. What's going on? Rick.

03:33:12
<transcript>: How are you.

03:33:15
uberrick: Maybe to show out of total available points

03:33:16
<transcript>: A lot of regulars showing up. Doveoid and Rick.

03:33:19
<transcript>: What is this.

03:33:21
<transcript>: Media store.

03:33:23
uberrick: I'm good thanks, how are you?

03:33:26
<transcript>: So we need some way to visualize like we're on a streak.

03:33:29
<transcript>: We're currently on a streak.

03:33:32
<transcript>: What is that? Firewall manager.

03:33:36
<transcript>: We need to see when we get plus 5 seconds.

03:33:40
<transcript>: Like that needs to go like, plus five.

03:33:46
<transcript>: Iot button.

03:33:53
<transcript>: How can we visualize this? Better.

03:33:53
<transcript>: i need to channel my

03:33:58
<transcript>: I need to channel my inner David maybe just show out of total available points.

03:34:01
<transcript>: So.

03:34:10
<transcript>: Total available points is infinite. You could theoretically just keep getting them right and go on forever. There's a very high school cap here.

03:34:18
uberrick: yeah could change colour like green/amber/red for count down timer

03:34:23
<transcript>: The thing is you loot so you lose 5 seconds every time you get answer right, you gain 5 seconds every time you get an answer right and you get pulling based on your street. So if you're on a streak you've gotten ten in a row right your next answer you get ten points.

03:34:23
<transcript>: the next one

03:34:28
<transcript>: The next 111 points like if you keep a street going, you're getting like way more point. You know I'm saying.

03:34:37
<transcript>: I'm good, I'm good, I'm great. It could change color, like green, Amber, red for countdown timer. Yes, I love that.

03:34:37
<transcript>: that

03:34:40
<transcript>: That adds some stress.

03:34:44
<transcript>: Okay.

03:34:44
<transcript>: yeah

03:34:47
<transcript>: Yeah, the colors. The just Orange dots not doing it.

03:34:54
teej_dv: could be written in rust for coolness

03:35:00
<transcript>: Your score, though. How do I want to visualize that you're getting like every time you answer one right on a streak, you're getting more points than you would have. So I think just the plus. Like if I'm just animating like, a plus.

03:35:00
<transcript>: like

03:35:03
<transcript>: Like you just got more points. That could be good.

03:35:03
uberrick: @teej_dv True

03:35:08
<transcript>: But do you need to have anywhere on the screen that shows you like your current streak.

03:35:11
<transcript>: I don't know.

03:35:15
<transcript>: I could put labels in all these.

03:35:15
<transcript>: maybe

03:35:19
<transcript>: Maybe that'd be more self explanatory. Yeah. That'd be or that'd be better, right.

03:35:21
<transcript>: So like in here.

03:35:23
<transcript>: Have a little label.

03:35:28
<transcript>: It's like.

03:35:31
<transcript>: Time.

03:35:34
<transcript>: That's really annoying.

03:35:34
<transcript>: time

03:35:40
<transcript>: Time, and we'll put it, we're gonna stack it. Did I do flex, I did flex on this.

03:35:46
<transcript>: I want to do.

03:35:46
<transcript>: another

03:35:48
<transcript>: Another Div.

03:35:57
<transcript>: And then this is so much harder when I have to do it like this.

03:35:57
<transcript>: and this division

03:36:00
<transcript>: And this division is gonna be class name.

03:36:00
<transcript>: flex

03:36:02
<transcript>: Flex call.

03:36:05
<transcript>: Items Center.

03:36:09
<transcript>: Phone.

03:36:12
<transcript>: Text Center.

03:36:20
<transcript>: Okay. And then the space between them is way too much.

03:36:20
<transcript>: also the text

03:36:24
<transcript>: Also the text is way too big and lots of other things.

03:36:30
<transcript>: We'll say, is that just my default font? Yeah, I'm just using that font on everything.

03:36:35
<transcript>: That's probably fine. Last name.

03:36:37
<transcript>: Six small.

03:36:41
<transcript>: And we'll say, text, white.

03:36:48
<transcript>: I don't know why there's so much space between them, but we're going to fix that. We're gonna say the same.

03:36:50
<transcript>: Y.

03:36:56
<transcript>: Is it leaving.

03:36:56
<transcript>: leading

03:36:58
<transcript>: Leading free.

03:37:01
<transcript>: Why is there so much space in them.

03:37:10
<transcript>: Could be written in rust for Coolness Tee is here.

03:37:10
<transcript>: i should write it

03:37:14
<transcript>: I should write it in rest, huh? That was cooler.

03:37:17
<transcript>: That would be much cooler.

03:37:17
<transcript>: what

03:37:20
<transcript>: What's going here? Line, height.

03:37:25
<transcript>: Does that have a margin on top of it.

03:37:31
uberrick: might need flex class adding for space-y-x

03:37:36
<transcript>: Closer together? Is this gonna look good, though? Do I even want time to be on there.

03:37:41
<transcript>: I need flex class adding for space yx.

03:37:45
<transcript>: I think I have flex call. Is that not.

03:37:48
<transcript>: Any flex to.

03:38:00
<transcript>: So annoying that every time I do that, maybe it doesn't need time. I don't know. Maybe it doesn't need a label. I mean, I need David. I should just have David design all of a bug. Guess.

03:38:00
<transcript>: it's such

03:38:03
<transcript>: It's such a dumb little project, but I hate to like.

03:38:07
<transcript>: Involve David, but this is.

03:38:07
<transcript>: this is

03:38:10
<transcript>: This is painful. Me trying to design things.

03:38:10
<transcript>: it's not good

03:38:14
<transcript>: It's not good. I'm thinking no label. Now.

03:38:18
<transcript>: Needed to see it, you know.

03:38:21
<transcript>: I've seen it, and I like it.

03:38:30
teej_dv: lol this css stuff looks so antifun

03:38:30
<transcript>: But how can we make this better so we can color that based on how much Time's left.

03:38:34
<transcript>: Css.

03:38:34
<transcript>: looks so

03:38:40
<transcript>: Looks so anti fun. It is. It's all just like guessing. You're just making stuff up.

03:38:47
<transcript>: Okay. So what if how can I make this look better.

03:38:47
<transcript>: what if

03:38:48
<transcript>: What if.

03:38:48
<transcript>: what

03:38:53
teej_dv: terminals are so cool.

03:38:53
<transcript>: What if these circles had there's just something weird about them. What if we had, like.

03:38:57
<transcript>: Hear me out.

03:38:57
<transcript>: i don't like shadows

03:38:59
<transcript>: I don't like shadows, but.

03:39:01
<transcript>: I do like.

03:39:05
<transcript>: Some separation between that Orange and that green, because it looks like.

03:39:05
<transcript>: i don't know

03:39:09
<transcript>: I don't know. A clown. Look, let's do this.

03:39:09
<transcript>: so this is

03:39:11
<transcript>: So this is my circle, right.

03:39:16
<transcript>: Yeah. So Background Orange. What if we said border.

03:39:19
<transcript>: Border two.

03:39:23
<transcript>: Or four? And what if we said.

03:39:23
<transcript>: border

03:39:27
<transcript>: Border. Is this blue color? What is it? Blue? Nine.

03:39:33
<transcript>: That the background is a blue nine. This is actually a blue color. It's gonna look coral.

03:39:33
<transcript>: ig

03:39:36
<transcript>: Ignore that what's the background color.

03:39:39
<transcript>: Tail end.

03:39:43
<transcript>: Blue.

03:39:45
<transcript>: I'll set background color.

03:39:52
<transcript>: Where would I have that? Maybe an app. Tsx.

03:40:02
<transcript>: Yeah, BG. Bluetoo. Oh, Bluetooth, of course it's erratics. Color scheme.

03:40:06
<transcript>: It's the Radics, Radics.

03:40:09
<transcript>: So let's do this.

03:40:12
<transcript>: Order blue.

03:40:12
<transcript>: to

03:40:16
<transcript>: To what if I did this? Is this dumb like crazy.

03:40:16
<transcript>: space there

03:40:17
<transcript>: Space. There.

03:40:17
<transcript>: that's better right

03:40:19
<transcript>: That's better, right.

03:40:34
<transcript>: Terminals are so cool. Yeah, I do wish I only worked on like APIs and CLIs and stuff. I wish I didn't do anything on the front end. That'd be fantastic actually. So it actually looks pretty good. I should make like a component for this little circle, but I'm not going to.

03:40:38
<transcript>: Should but am I going to quarter for Border blue.

03:40:40
teej_dv: terminals are a frontend

03:40:43
<transcript>: Cool. I think this is an improvement.

03:40:55
<transcript>: Terminal terminals are a front end. That's true. Peach. I shouldn't make anything for the browser. I should just stop working on the browser. Is what I'm hearing. That would be fantastic. Actually.

03:40:58
teej_dv: agreed.

03:41:02
<transcript>: Let's see what else.

03:41:09
<transcript>: Visually still needs some work. We need some animations for like when you get them right.

03:41:10
<transcript>: actually not

03:41:13
<transcript>: Actually not what this one is. Don't I? Is that SNS.

03:41:13
<transcript>: oh

03:41:16
<transcript>: Oh Geez no MQ.

03:41:18
<transcript>: Never seen this one.

03:41:18
<transcript>: what does that look

03:41:19
zappy_idk: This song bops

03:41:21
<transcript>: What does that look like? A plunger? What is that.

03:41:21
<transcript>: what is this thing

03:41:22
<transcript>: What is this thing.

03:41:23
uberrick: TUI for life

03:41:27
<transcript>: Well architected tool.

03:41:27
<transcript>: open

03:41:29
<transcript>: Open telemetry. Maybe.

03:41:29
<transcript>: yeah

03:41:30
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:41:35
<transcript>: Some of these icons are ridiculous.

03:41:38
<transcript>: False injection simulator. Probably. Yeah.

03:41:41
<transcript>: Okay.

03:41:47
<transcript>: Repost. So you're getting points. We're gonna animate the getting points thing.

03:42:04
<transcript>: Okay, how would we animate it? I think what we would do is we just have, like, okay, let me hear me out. Hear me out. What if I put So this is our score right here. What if I said another one of these? But then instead of white, I said it's. Text, green, nine.

03:42:04
<transcript>: okay

03:42:05
<transcript>: Okay.

03:42:08
<transcript>: Every time talk about that.

03:42:16
<transcript>: Just the feedback loop. Every time I say that file, I have to start a new game. Thank you for the follow. Jan pavk.

03:42:16
<transcript>: this

03:42:21
<transcript>: This song Bops I agree all glass Animals are the best.

03:42:21
<transcript>: t

03:42:31
<transcript>: Tui for life. What's Tui? So what if I did this? What if I said that green does not stand out on that Orange? But what if I said.

03:42:34
<transcript>: This one is.

03:42:37
<transcript>: Absolute.

03:42:39
<transcript>: Top.

03:42:43
<transcript>: Zero.

03:42:43
<transcript>: right zero

03:42:44
<transcript>: Right, zero.

03:42:51
<transcript>: What if I analyze this thing in? And what if I put a plus on it? So let's just make this up.

03:42:56
<transcript>: A plus.

03:42:56
<transcript>: seven

03:42:59
<transcript>: Seven. We're just making this up.

03:43:06
<transcript>: Okay. It's looking terrible. Pretty awful. Those colors clash so bad.

03:43:06
<transcript>: save the

03:43:09
<transcript>: Save the Bob Capin.

03:43:09
<transcript>: yeah how can we

03:43:17
<transcript>: Yeah. How can we make this attractive with all these weird colors going on? I just want to show like it's just needs to be a color that would stand out more. Maybe just brighter.

03:43:20
<transcript>: Maybe just brighter.

03:43:28
<transcript>: So we're brighter. Would that help? I could use one of the that's a little better.

03:43:28
<transcript>: is that the

03:43:31
<transcript>: Is that the brightest? No. I think there's a twelve.

03:43:37
<transcript>: Nope. There's not a twelve. Or if there is this is basically white.

03:43:49
<transcript>: I can use one of the other Radic colors. There's, like a lime color. But how am I gonna make that stand out? I guess it stands out on the blue background. Okay, so what if I just move it more.

03:44:05
<transcript>: I'm really bad. Hey, Ted, you're here. I'm really bad at hitting number keys. I find that like, oh, that's way up there.

03:44:05
<transcript>: i'm just

03:44:09
fredvanrijswijk: No Margins left

03:44:10
<transcript>: I'm just so bad at, like accurately hitting symbols and numbers.

03:44:14
<transcript>: Is there like is it just a practicing if it just never done it that much.

03:44:14
<transcript>: that's

03:44:16
<transcript>: That's looking better.

03:44:19
<transcript>: No Margins left.

03:44:24
teej_dv: yes, you need to do typing test.

03:44:25
<transcript>: Yeah? I need? I need less than that? So still yet less.

03:44:25
<transcript>: right

03:44:26
<transcript>: Right.

03:44:30
teej_dv: with those and practice.

03:44:30
<transcript>: Nothing like this feedback loop.

03:44:30
<transcript>: okay

03:44:37
<transcript>: Okay. So like something like that. And then we like animated up in the air and like fades in and just like, you know, I'm saying.

03:44:39
kapangyarihan: @teej_dv ok rms

03:44:43
<transcript>: Yes. You need to do typing tests with those in practice. Okay. That makes sense.

03:44:44
teej_dv: with a box over your keyboard.

03:44:48
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Captain with a box over your keyboard.

03:44:48
<transcript>: a box over

03:44:50
<transcript>: A box over my keyboard.

03:44:50
<transcript>: you sound like i don't look

03:44:51
<transcript>: You sound like I don't look.

03:44:57
teej_dv: yes

03:45:04
<transcript>: I don't think I have a problem with looking. I just miss a lot. And then I have, like, back and go, like, I just have to keep, you know, saying just so I don't look, let me just let's just do this typing test.

03:45:06
teej_dv: I guarantee you it will make you more accurate

03:45:08
<transcript>: Do they all have numbers in them.

03:45:11
<transcript>: This is terrible. What is this.

03:45:11
<transcript>: no

03:45:13
<transcript>: No.

03:45:18
<transcript>: Is there like a really good model typing test key hero.

03:45:25
zappy_idk: monkeytype.com

03:45:31
<transcript>: Typing.com. That's an exclusive domain. At least how do I make how do I make sure there's numbers in it? Will these all have numbers in them.

03:45:34
<transcript>: Time test page test let's do this.

03:45:38
evonux: @zappy_idk aah you beat me to it :D

03:45:39
<transcript>: Okay.

03:45:50
<transcript>: There's numbers, there's numbers that I'm mad at them. Titanic is the largest art of fish. Oh, Fishel, moving object in the world.

03:45:50
<transcript>: she is

03:45:52
<transcript>: She is as.

03:45:59
<transcript>: Long as for city blocks, turns out I'm terrible at typing. Oh, this is so, so stressful.

03:46:02
<transcript>: For Lane Highway.

03:46:04
<transcript>: Highway.

03:46:04
<transcript>: some people

03:46:07
<transcript>: Some people say she is.

03:46:11
<transcript>: Unthinkable.

03:46:13

03:46:50
<transcript>: they just i

03:46:55
<transcript>: They just. I. They just teased me. I don't want to sign up. I just want to do a typing test.

03:46:55
<transcript>: come on

03:46:57
<transcript>: Come on now.

03:46:57
<transcript>: this looks way better

03:47:00
nexxeln: use monkeytype

03:47:01
<transcript>: This looks way better. Okay. Numbers will include numbers.

03:47:01
<transcript>: in have

naveen_1999: Yooo

03:47:04
<transcript>: In have no home.

03:47:51
<transcript>: i would have

03:47:56
<transcript>: I would have preferred, like, six sentences. Is there an option for that? Because those were just kind of like random collections of words.

03:47:58
<transcript>: Consistency. What's that mean.

03:48:02
<transcript>: Only got one incorrect character.

03:48:47
<transcript>: Thick.

03:48:50
<transcript>: I need to learn the numbers, you know.

03:48:54
<transcript>: I guess punctuation would make it more like sentences.

03:48:54
<transcript>: i

03:48:58
<transcript>: I feel like it's easier to type sentences than it is.

03:49:05
<transcript>: General Comm won't plan like it's just something about your brain. It just doesn't work.

03:49:05
<transcript>: as well

<transcript>: When there's no.

03:49:17

03:49:17
<transcript>: oh

03:49:22
<transcript>: Oh, it's just how many words I'm just gonna do that many words instead of time. Now we'll do time.

03:49:22
<transcript>: maybe

03:49:25
<transcript>: Maybe we'll just get more of it. So we get more and.

03:49:25
<transcript>: here we go

<transcript>: I'm so bad.

03:49:51
<transcript>: why is this in

<transcript>: Why is this in so much harder.

03:50:00
<transcript>: Possible.

03:50:03
<transcript>: Oh, Geez.

03:50:19
<transcript>: Oh, here's the number two. One, two. That's so bad.

03:50:21
nexxeln: oof

03:50:24
<transcript>: This is a terrible test.

03:50:24
<transcript>: i mean i'm

03:50:26
<transcript>: I mean, I'm so bad at this.

03:50:28
<transcript>: 58.

03:50:33
<transcript>: It's the P. Rong.

03:50:37
<transcript>: That was terrible. Okay.

03:50:43
<transcript>: We're just we're gonna end on that one. That was tough.

03:50:43
<transcript>: those little rough

03:50:45
<transcript>: Those little rough actions. She was bad.

03:50:45
<transcript>: let's try one with

03:50:52
<transcript>: Let's try one with that numbers just because I want to see like if actually doing quotes is faster for me, like it's actual words. Let's try it.

03:50:52
<transcript>: this

03:50:54
<transcript>: This.

03:51:02
<transcript>: Way.

03:51:34
<transcript>: Remember did I do it like a certain length of this test.

03:51:35
okufa_f: broooo, you're a co founder of statmuse??/

03:51:35
<transcript>: Words. I don't know.

03:51:46
<transcript>: Dragon Racing. What was that quote from that was better, but okay.

03:51:57
<transcript>: Bro. You're a cofounder of Savvy's. I am a Koofa. I am a cofounder of statmes. I built Sammy's with my two bare hands, like eight years ago.

03:51:57
<transcript>: and

03:52:11
<transcript>: And I'm actually back at Stack. I was gone for three years, and I've just rejoined Statues. Seven announced it super publicly yet because there's still some people that need to be told and conversations that need to be had. But I'm going back to statmes.

03:52:15
nexxeln: how many DAUs does statmuse have

03:52:15
<transcript>: Okay. Monkey type. That was fun. I need to do more practical.

03:52:15
<transcript>: numbers

03:52:16
<transcript>: Numbers.

03:52:16
<transcript>: because

03:52:28
<transcript>: Because I'm not so good at it. How many daily active users to set me stuff? I don't know. So I've just joined like I literally haven't even. Like, I don't have my employees agreement officially yet.

03:52:35
<transcript>: But what I've been told is status today is doing something like a million searches a day.

03:52:41
<transcript>: So if you go to Samues.com, the whole thing is it's like a search engine for sports and finance, statistics.

03:52:41
<transcript>: so

03:52:46
<transcript>: So it does about a million searches a day. Like this is a search, right? Like.

03:52:49
<transcript>: Who won the cheese game.

03:52:49
<transcript>: that's a search

03:52:52
<transcript>: That's a search. There does a million of those a day.

03:52:55
okufa_f: is statmuse hiring

03:52:57
<transcript>: And I think something like 10 million uniques come from Google each month.

03:52:58
nexxeln: oh cool

03:53:03
<transcript>: So we get a lot of traffic. Google, SEO traffic. So like.

03:53:03
<transcript>: which

03:53:06
nexxeln: damn huge website

03:53:08
<transcript>: Which pitcher pitcher picture picture has no.

03:53:08
<transcript>: strike

03:53:10
<transcript>: Strikeouts.

03:53:10
<transcript>: in a

03:53:14
<transcript>: In a season this question is like really long.

03:53:14
<transcript>: long

03:53:22
<transcript>: Long tail sports questions. We generally are very hot. Well, we're not that high on this one. I don't know if our baseball says we're good. So we're on the first page. Not that great.

03:53:22
<transcript>: let's

03:53:25
okufa_f: statmuse can't do streaks yet. im sad

03:53:27
<transcript>: Let's say most strikeouts in a season. I'm curious.

03:53:32
<transcript>: Those Strikeouts in a season. Baseball reference.

03:53:41
<transcript>: Okay, so not on the first page on that one. I know, like sack if we do NSL Stats, I think Status does really well. Yeah. Most sacks, most.

03:53:41
<transcript>: ta

03:53:43
<transcript>: Tackles.

03:53:48
<transcript>: That means is number one on a lot of sports questions.

03:53:48
<transcript>: still early on the final

03:53:56
<transcript>: Still early on the final side, but I think getting there or if we say, like, LeBron James, like, what is the top? Where does Statmes land here.

03:54:01
<transcript>: Are we on the first page? Maybe not.

03:54:01
<transcript>: lebron

03:54:03
<transcript>: Lebron James Stats. Maybe.

03:54:03
<transcript>: i know

03:54:06
<transcript>: I know we do pretty well on some of these.

03:54:12
<transcript>: Fastboard Reference, ESPN Mba.com Status Radio Right there.

03:54:12
<transcript>: so

03:54:16
<transcript>: So yeah, it does a lot of traffic from Google, I guess, is what I'm saying.

03:54:16
<transcript>: yeah

03:54:20
<transcript>: Yeah, it's a big one. It's a big website. Can't do streaks yet.

03:54:24
nexxeln: statmuse broken on my end https://nexxel-has.no-friends.xyz/brave_SH0rUJ3NEG.png

03:54:24
<transcript>: A Koopa. I can remember. Like I don't know.

03:54:24
<transcript>: six

03:54:30
<transcript>: Six, seven years ago, in the very early days of Savvy Zack. People. I can remember people asking for streets.

03:54:30
<transcript>: and

03:54:50
<transcript>: And I remember trying to work on it at one point. It's such a hard thing. The database queries for that are just a nightmare. But I remember trying to add support really early on and then just sort we just shelted it for years like people I really want streaks, everyone's quarter stats and streets. And we just it was so hard to get to it and to actually implement.

03:54:54
<transcript>: Sammy's broken on your end. What.

03:55:00
<transcript>: What next one has no friend. What is this link? What is this.

03:55:04
<transcript>: It's broken. Oh, my word.

03:55:04
<transcript>: down

03:55:07
<transcript>: Download so that's in Brave browser.

03:55:10
<transcript>: Is that what it looks like in brave.

03:55:10
<transcript>: ish

03:55:13
nexxeln: yeah

03:55:13
<transcript>: Ish you know what? I'm actually.

03:55:13
<transcript>: i

03:55:15
okufa_f: works fine on brave

03:55:16
<transcript>: I don't want to talk too much about this yet.

03:55:16
<transcript>: but

03:55:17
<transcript>: But.

03:55:17
<transcript>: samus

03:55:19
<transcript>: Samus.com.

03:55:19
<transcript>: what you see

03:55:23
<transcript>: What you see, the website Today was written like six years ago, fundamentally.

03:55:27
<transcript>: Works fine on Brave. Okay. So maybe not in India.

03:55:27
<transcript>: anyway

03:55:45
<transcript>: Anyway, this site was built, like six years ago. I think it's a Create React app. I mean, it's like if you were gonna build Samues.com today in 2022, it's like on the far end of the spectrum of what you wouldn't choose technology wise, like, it's a big React app. And ultimately, it's just a bunch of these, like, pages.

03:55:45
<transcript>: that are just like

03:55:47
<transcript>: That are just like stats.

03:55:47
<transcript>: and

03:55:52
okufa_f: honestly react is still good in 2022

03:56:01
<transcript>: And visuals like there's charts and like images of players. It's really like hardly interactive. Right? These tables, you can like sort tables and stuff. But like this show not be a spa. And it's basically written like a spa.

03:56:04
<transcript>: So I'm actually gonna be doing something about that.

03:56:07
nexxeln: remix is great for this

03:56:07
<transcript>: And again, I don't want to say too much.

03:56:11
<transcript>: React is so good. Yeah, no, no, that's nothing wrong with react.

03:56:11
<transcript>: it's just

03:56:19
<transcript>: It's just I don't think this app really should be a React app. I think this app should be it's more content driven. It's more like.

03:56:19
<transcript>: a site

03:56:21
okufa_f: are you on the htmx hype

03:56:25
<transcript>: A site than an app, if you will. If you buy into that distinction, your remix would be great. Yeah.

03:56:30
<transcript>: I think I'm gonna I think I'm gonna build Sam use.com in Astro.

03:56:30
<transcript>: i think

03:56:30
teej_dv: well.... not NOTHING wrong with react

03:56:37
<transcript>: I think it'll be an Astro site with like, maybe the little bits of interactivity might be like solid. I just want to do something more mental.

03:56:37
<transcript>: than

03:56:39
<transcript>: Than what it currently is.

03:56:44
okufa_f: don't you still have to choose a framework in astro

03:56:45
<transcript>: Because these pages do get crawled and they're they're pretty slow.

03:57:01
nexxeln: ooo getting charts in astro would be tough, react has libaries which makes it easy

03:57:05
<transcript>: Like they don't score well in terms of timing and all that these it's felt pretty snappy. I mean, nothing here has felt too terribly slow. But like all that data that's client generate, that's client side rendered and that's bad. Like all these tables should just be flat HTML rendered in the browser. Right. And then we should progressively enhance, make them interactive. That's what we're gonna do.

03:57:08
<transcript>: But it's it's gonna be a process.

03:57:08
<transcript>: well

03:57:12
<transcript>: Well, not nothing wrong with react well, Yeah.

03:57:12
<transcript>: i have

03:57:18
<transcript>: I have issues with React. My issue with React is I've been writing React apps for eight years.

03:57:18
<transcript>: and

03:57:19
nexxeln: you would probably have to use astro + react

03:57:32
<transcript>: And I still there's things I just still fundamentally. They just don't work in my brain like I still get stuff wrong consistently. And I feel like if I can't pick if I can't figure it all out in eight years, is that my fault or is that.

03:57:34
<transcript>: Reacts fault.

03:57:34
<transcript>: i'm gonna say

03:57:38
<transcript>: I'm gonna say the frameworks fault, but then I didn't know if is a framework. I don't know what Rack react is.

03:57:40
nexxeln: im using create-jd-app for all my projects now

03:57:46
ghostyx101: some hooks a re just a night mare

03:57:48
<transcript>: Don't you still have to choose a framework in Astro? Yeah. For frontend interactivity. Like, I think something like solid, something really small, because there's just not that much.

03:57:48
<transcript>: there's not that much

03:57:49
<transcript>: There's not that much interactivity.

03:57:49
<transcript>: it's just a bunch of

03:57:59
<transcript>: It's just a bunch of hyperlinks, right? Like all these links. I hate that they're not. They're generated on the client. Like that. They're generated and react when those could all be linking to the actual pages.

03:58:00
ghostyx101: after 4 yrs stil lconfused

03:58:03
<transcript>: You know straight HTML from the server.

03:58:15
<transcript>: You would probably have to use oh, getting charts in Astro would be tough. React has libraries which make it easy. Yeah, yeah, I think solids. I think there's some like charting library's in Solid that'll work for these charts.

03:58:15
<transcript>: yeah

03:58:22
<transcript>: Yeah, Astro Plus React or Astro Plus something else I'm using Create JD app for all my projects now what's JD app.

03:58:22
<transcript>: some hooks

03:58:23
<transcript>: Some hooks.

03:58:23
<transcript>: are just

03:58:24
clouds187: What are your opinions on NestJS for backend?

03:58:28
<transcript>: Are just a nightmare after four years still confused thank you ghosty I saw I feel.

03:58:28
<transcript>: cloud

03:58:36
<transcript>: Clouds. Welcome to Chat. What are your opinions on Nest JS? For backend. I've never used Nest JS, so I'm very familiar with SJS.

03:58:42
<transcript>: As a player in a space I'm aware of it, never used it.

03:58:47
okufa_f: nba, nfl, or mlb

03:58:52
nexxeln: solid start using t3 stack is jd-app https://github.com/OrJDev/create-jd-app

03:58:53
mattmancodes: NestJS = horrible

03:58:56
<transcript>: So fun. Fact. These illustrations. I always like to talk about Michael Waltzalk. We have Sammy Calm. It's this natural language processing thing. Like it takes force questions and figures out.

03:58:59
<transcript>: Pat.

03:58:59
<transcript>: mahome

03:59:01
<transcript>: Mahomes most.

03:59:02
nexxeln: nestJS = angular

03:59:10
<transcript>: Rushing yards in a game like it handles really complicated queries, because we've built this natural language processing stuff.

03:59:10
mattmancodes: Exactly

03:59:15
okufa_f: what do you think of statmuse's presence on twitter

03:59:16
<transcript>: Oh, that was just this year. His most rushing eyes was just like this month.

03:59:16
<transcript>: anyway

03:59:25
<transcript>: Anyway, it's got like that whole piece of it. But it's also just like kind of a media company in some ways. So we have you go to Twitter.

03:59:27
<transcript>: That means.

03:59:27
<transcript>: does really well

03:59:33
<transcript>: Does really well on Twitter. People Sports Answers is very passionate. Oh, Geez, I've got my DMs open.

03:59:41
<transcript>: sp

03:59:42
<transcript>: Sportsats.

03:59:42
<transcript>: so we've

03:59:53
<transcript>: So we've got this social media side that means this really well on, like Twitter and Instagram in these places. But what I want to talk about was these illustrations. There's a Gallery, I think. Yeah.

03:59:58
<transcript>: Michael Walter Walt is an Illustrator. He lives out in Arizona.

03:59:58
<transcript>: and

04:00:10
<transcript>: And for like seven years, he's worked at Statmes longer than I worked at St for seven years, every single day he just makes these illustrations. And there's like four or 50 of them now, like, across all the major.

04:00:10
<transcript>: sports

04:00:12
<transcript>: Sports. He's just drawing people.

04:00:12
<transcript>: just like

04:00:18
<transcript>: Just like this. So there's this very unique status style that is basically just Michael waltzhock.

04:00:21
<transcript>: Anyway.

04:00:21
<transcript>: nest

04:00:24
<transcript>: Nest JS horrible Uhoh.

04:01:03
<transcript>: a lot of people

04:01:07
<transcript>: A lot of people don't like their team getting slandered.

<transcript>: That sports.

04:03:00
<transcript>: Okay. Let's go back to it.

04:03:04
<transcript>: but

04:03:05
<transcript>: But.

04:03:05
<transcript>: i was doing a

04:03:08
<transcript>: I was doing a typing test. And then what was I doing before that.

04:03:10
<transcript>: I remember.

04:03:16
<transcript>: I remember we were doing this. We're styling. I want to animate these.

04:03:16
<transcript>: these

04:03:18
<transcript>: These the points you get.

04:03:19
okufa_f: is statmuse hiring lmao

04:04:10
<transcript>: i appreciate

04:04:12
<transcript>: I appreciate your follows.

04:04:16
<transcript>: Santa's hireing.

04:04:16
<transcript>: i don't

04:04:18
<transcript>: I don't know actually.

04:04:18
<transcript>: beyond

04:04:20
<transcript>: Beyond.

04:04:20
<transcript>: they

04:04:20
exoswarm: you know those capture the flag competition

04:04:21
<transcript>: They just hired me.

04:04:21
<transcript>: so

04:04:23
<transcript>: So.

04:04:23
<transcript>: i don't

04:04:27
exoswarm: sec, ill find him

04:04:28
<transcript>: I don't know if they're hiring others. You know those capture the flag competition.

04:04:32
<transcript>: Oh, CTF has captured a flag. I am not that person.

04:04:32
<transcript>: wait is it

04:04:34
<transcript>: Wait, is it are you talking about Mr. Beast.

04:04:37
<transcript>: No, why.

04:04:37
<transcript>: ctf

04:04:44
<transcript>: Ctf enthusiasts. I don't know who that is. I've been told I look like Mr. Beast. Every time someone says, OK, YouTuber. I assume that's what they mean.

04:04:44
exoswarm: nono, w8

04:04:49
<transcript>: Okay. So let's say we have this number. And we said.

04:04:51
nexxeln: what

04:04:51
<transcript>: Let's say we said animate.

04:04:54
nexxeln: you don't at all

04:04:55
<transcript>: I'm just gonna do one.

04:05:03
<transcript>: And we'll change it. So Paul's would not be what we want. But then I also only want to animate it.

04:05:03
<transcript>: like

04:05:08
<transcript>: Like when it enters. I don't want to do this. Am I gonna use framer.

04:05:08
<transcript>: am i

04:05:10
<transcript>: Am I using framer for this project.

04:05:14
exoswarm: LiveOverflow

04:05:15
<transcript>: Next is something I look at all like MrBeast. I don't really think so either.

04:05:20
<transcript>: But I I look at my face all day so, you know.

04:05:20
<transcript>: i wouldn't

04:05:22
exoswarm: you look a bit like him :D

04:05:23
<transcript>: I wouldn't probably think I do.

04:05:24
okufa_f: i prefer react spring over framer motion

04:05:24
exoswarm: https://www.youtube.com/c/LiveOverflow

04:05:28
<transcript>: Wait. Okay. You look a bit like a live overflow. Okay. I'm curious.

04:05:31
<transcript>: Live overflow.

04:05:34
okufa_f: i guess they're pretty much the same thing anyways

04:05:34
<transcript>: Who's this.

04:05:42
exoswarm: but a bit older, no offence :D

04:05:42
<transcript>: I see it. I can see it. I am not him. But I definitely see it.

04:05:49
<transcript>: How can I get a better visual of the face.

04:05:54
<transcript>: Yeah.

04:06:00
<transcript>: I see it, I see the resemblance.

04:06:00
<transcript>: a bit old

04:06:03
<transcript>: A bit older. No offense. None taken.

04:06:05
<transcript>: None taken.

04:06:05
<transcript>: i guess

04:06:06
nexxeln: oh that is very similar

04:06:08
<transcript>: I guess they're pretty much the same thing anyways.

04:06:08
<transcript>: you prefer

04:06:17
<transcript>: You prefer react spring over frame Remotion. I don't really like any of the animation libraries. I just. I don't know exosform. Thanks. Don't shall follow.

04:06:19
<transcript>: There's something about.

04:06:19
<transcript>: something

04:06:28
<transcript>: Something about the animation libraries that have never felt intuitive to me. I think I'll just make a I'll just make a tailwind animation that's easy enough. I know how to do that.

04:06:28
<transcript>: we'll

04:06:33
<transcript>: We'll make a tailwind animation. And then we're gonna say that this one just like animates in.

04:06:37
<transcript>: So we're only gonna show it. I don't want to do that.

04:06:41
<transcript>: When you after you get a result back.

04:06:44
<transcript>: We're going to.

04:06:46
<transcript>: Let me think.

04:06:52
<transcript>: Just want to show it from a moment. I guess the animation could just make it disappear, right.

04:06:57
<transcript>: So let's say we.

04:06:57
<transcript>: say

04:06:59
<transcript>: Say we did.

04:06:59
<transcript>: tag

04:07:00
<transcript>: Tag.

04:07:00
<transcript>: like that

04:07:03
<transcript>: Like that. And we've said.

04:07:03
<transcript>: context

04:07:05
<transcript>: Context result.

04:07:14
<transcript>: We need to send back just the score Delta.

04:07:19
<transcript>: Yeah, we're gonna smack the score Delta.

04:07:23
<transcript>: We're.

04:07:26
<transcript>: Delta, Yeah.

04:07:26
<transcript>: we're gonna send it back

04:07:30
<transcript>: We're gonna send it back to the client in this response.

04:07:37
<transcript>: Or Delta. Maybe I also want to score. Yeah. Expires. Delta.

04:07:41
<transcript>: I can show the timer animate to.

04:07:43
<transcript>: Okay.

04:07:50
<transcript>: Let's go back here.

04:07:53
<transcript>: Here. So this is gonna be.

04:08:00
<transcript>: Game Dot store Delta.

04:08:04
<transcript>: Lc resort.

04:08:07
<transcript>: There find it.

04:08:10
<transcript>: Isn't it.

04:08:10
<transcript>: not

04:08:11
<transcript>: Not.

04:08:15
<transcript>: Is this type game undefined.

04:08:20
<transcript>: Oh, it's not on the game? The son of the game.

04:08:26
<transcript>: There we go. Okay, score, Delta. And then we're gonna say.

04:08:34
<transcript>: It can't just be scored out X I need to do like plus or minus.

04:08:36
<transcript>: Context.

04:08:39
<transcript>: Result.

04:08:46
<transcript>: I don't want to do the plus and a minus. I guess I can just add a plus if it's above zero or whatever.

04:08:46
<transcript>: text track

04:08:48
<transcript>: Text track.

04:08:48
<transcript>: so

04:08:51
<transcript>: So there it did like a two see that.

04:08:51
<transcript>: you see a little

04:08:53
<transcript>: You see a little flash.

04:08:53
<transcript>: but we

04:08:55
<transcript>: But we want to do a different animation.

04:09:00
<transcript>: But something like that. I mean, Snowball edge.

04:09:00
<transcript>: so

04:09:04
<transcript>: So that added three points, because I'm on a streak that's fire hose.

04:09:10
<transcript>: Four. Okay, imagine that. The better animation. Is this feeling? Better.

04:09:10
<transcript>: health

04:09:12
<transcript>: Health Lake.

04:09:17
<transcript>: What do we think.

04:09:17
<transcript>: something

04:09:20
<transcript>: Something like this.

04:09:20
<transcript>: what is this

04:09:22
<transcript>: What is this? Comprehend.

04:09:26
<transcript>: Yeah.

04:09:31
<transcript>: What? I don't know what this one is. Think back.

04:09:31
<transcript>: deep racer

04:09:33
<transcript>: Deep racer Thinkbox.

04:09:33
<transcript>: seven

04:09:38
<transcript>: Seven points so I need a plus in front of it or minus if it's less than zero.

04:09:38
<transcript>: so let's just do that

04:09:40
<transcript>: So let's just do that. Let's say.

04:09:44
<transcript>: Let's see.

04:10:01
<transcript>: Okay. I.

04:10:03
<transcript>: 'll Put and we're gonna do.

04:10:07
<transcript>: Like this. It's gonna be.

04:10:09
<transcript>: Plot.

04:10:12
<transcript>: Plus.

04:10:15
<transcript>: If.

04:10:15
<transcript>: let's see if

04:10:19
<transcript>: Let's see if context that result score Delta.

04:10:22
<transcript>: Is greater than zero.

04:10:27
<transcript>: What a good song.

04:10:27
<transcript>: dirty work

04:10:28
<transcript>: Dirty work.

04:10:28
<transcript>: need dirty

04:10:33
<transcript>: Need dirty work fans. Any Steely Dan's hands? What am I doing? What do I just do.

04:10:40
<transcript>: Okay. Greater than zero. We do that. Else we do.

04:10:40
<transcript>: minus

04:10:41
<transcript>: Minus.

04:10:46
<transcript>: Like that. That looks so bad. But that's what we're doing.

04:10:55
<transcript>: This elemental conductor. Yeah, plus, dude.

04:10:59
<transcript>: We're gonna have it kind of like fade up. It'll be better than that.

04:11:01
<transcript>: What is this.

04:11:09
<transcript>: Alright. Let's extend. Yep. Plus three I got for the first one is doing plus two on your first answer. That's not good.

04:11:12
<transcript>: That shouldn't do that.

04:11:15
<transcript>: Or Delta.

04:11:15
<transcript>: so

04:11:18
<transcript>: So expired one plus streak streak should be zero.

04:11:22
<transcript>: Streak should be zero.

04:11:28
<transcript>: Okay, so it shouldn't be one plus three. C. This should be streak.

04:11:32
<transcript>: Right.

04:11:34
<transcript>: Yeah.

04:11:36
<transcript>: That should just be streak.

04:11:45
<transcript>: Lost chat. You all just disappeared. You got busy.

04:11:50
<transcript>: That's fine. I understand. I'm gonna be down here pretty soon.

04:11:56
<transcript>: I'm in Chat. Where am I? Where's my mouse.

04:11:59
nexxeln: i am here

04:12:03
<transcript>: Okay.

04:12:03
<transcript>: back

04:12:05
<transcript>: Back index.

04:12:12
<transcript>: Okay. So now it should start at one.

04:12:12
<transcript>: that should be better

04:12:13
<transcript>: That should be better.

04:12:17
<transcript>: Look at the first one. Right. Let's see.

04:12:17
<transcript>: false injection

04:12:20
<transcript>: False injection simulator plus one.

04:12:26
<transcript>: Morph Darko. Thank you for the follow. Nexus. Here. Next is still here.

04:12:26
<transcript>: hey next is

04:12:28
<transcript>: Hey, Next is Prisma. Slow.

04:12:31
<transcript>: Is it Prisma? Or is it me.

04:12:31
<transcript>: eks

04:12:34
<transcript>: Eks Distro plus two.

04:12:35
nexxeln: very

04:12:39
<transcript>: Amplify plus three.

04:12:39
nexxeln: very very slow

04:12:43
<transcript>: You can't make a better animation because that one's terrible.

04:12:45
<transcript>: Animate.

04:12:49
<transcript>: Let's just go to our tail, wind.

04:12:55
<transcript>: Okay, I've done this before, but I'm definitely gonna have to copy something from the docs.

04:12:55
<transcript>: fill in custom

04:12:57
<transcript>: Fill in Custom animation.

04:13:02
nexxeln: https://www.nexxel.dev/blog/typesafe-database this is what you do to make db queries fast

04:13:13
<transcript>: Here we go. Extend animation.

04:13:17
<transcript>: Spin slow I'm gonna have to make some key frame.

04:13:33
<transcript>: Okay keyframes.

04:13:40
<transcript>: Here we go, keyframes.

04:13:42
<transcript>: And then.

04:13:44
<transcript>: We're gonna copy.

04:13:47
<transcript>: Animation as well.

04:13:55
<transcript>: So instead of wiggle, this is gonna be we're gonna call it up here.

04:13:59
<transcript>: And zero to 100%, we're gonna say Red, no, we're gonna say.

04:14:03
<transcript>: What are we gonna do.

04:14:06
<transcript>: I want to, like, move it in.

04:14:06
<transcript>: there

04:14:08
<transcript>: There any examples of moving.

04:14:14
<transcript>: Nothing. Up. It's like translate or transform. Here we go. Yeah. Exactly. This.

04:14:18
<transcript>: Exactly. We even want to have a timing function.

04:14:38
<transcript>: Delete to okay like that.

04:14:40
<transcript>: What's this about.

04:14:44
<transcript>: What's this about? I need to have a.

04:14:48
<transcript>: This and then get rid of the.

04:14:57
<transcript>: Like that. Can I do it like that? No. This is all a string, isn't it? What? What did I just do.

04:15:02
<transcript>: Paho, thanks so much for the follow. I mean for the subscription.

04:15:05
<transcript>: Thank you so much.

04:15:09
<transcript>: Oh, wow, thank you for subscribing for two months.

04:15:09
<transcript>: i appreciate that

04:15:10
<transcript>: I appreciate that.

04:15:10
<transcript>: greatly

04:15:12
<transcript>: Greatly.

04:15:19
<transcript>: Very, very slow. Okay, next, that's the thought. This is what you do to make DB queries fast.

04:15:21
<transcript>: Database. Thank you.

04:15:23
<transcript>: Next you're the best.

04:15:23
<transcript>: you the best

04:15:25
<transcript>: You the best.

04:15:25
<transcript>: time save

04:15:28
<transcript>: Time save database Queries on the edge.

04:15:31
<transcript>: Prisma so you do use.

04:15:31
<transcript>: lee

04:15:34
<transcript>: Lee. Yeah. So we started to do kaisely.

04:15:34
<transcript>: and then i

04:15:37
fredvanrijswijk: Whistle is not nice for headphones, sorry ;-)

04:15:44
<transcript>: And then I just I didn't know if I was gonna get the gains I was hoping for works in serverless and edge environments, even. Do you know support for these in plantscode? David's Driver, using kind of this perfect only thing is.

04:15:51
<transcript>: The finding scheme is inside. Shift is rough. It also doesn't have anything like Prism migrate to manage diabetes migrations. Oh so you've got something.

04:15:51
<transcript>: you got

04:15:55
<transcript>: You got a solution are used in prism just for the migrations.

04:15:55
<transcript>: and then

04:15:59
<transcript>: And then you use Kaisely for the runtime stuff. Is that what you're doing.

04:16:03
<transcript>: That's beautiful. If that's what you're doing? Is that what you're doing.

04:16:08
nexxeln: yes

04:16:09
<transcript>: Whistle is not nice for headphones. Oh, sorry, Fred. I won't. With what? Anymore? I'm so sorry.

04:16:13
<transcript>: That's probably not a good idea. Next, this is brilliant.

04:16:18
<transcript>: I love it. So you still get the benefits of all the Prism Migration stuff.

04:16:18
<transcript>: and defining

04:16:19
nexxeln: prisma for schema. typedefs and migrations

04:16:22
<transcript>: And defining your schema. But then you're querying with kaisely.

04:16:22
<transcript>: love it

04:16:23
<transcript>: Love it.

04:16:24
nexxeln: kysely for running it

04:16:25
<transcript>: Okay. I'm gonna read that later.

04:16:28
<transcript>: Let's see.

04:16:38
<transcript>: Kaisely from running at EA Prison for skiing. I Typed some migrations. Love it okay. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it eventually. Just not today.

04:16:38
tactical_pinguim: Im a simple guy, i see neovim, i follow

04:16:41
<transcript>: Think of the Follow Tactical Penguin.

04:16:41
fredvanrijswijk: SeemsGood

04:16:46
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat as well. I'm a simple guys. See Neil VENM. I follow.

04:16:50
<transcript>: Fred.

04:16:50
<transcript>: thumbs up

04:16:51
<transcript>: Thumbs up.

04:16:51
<transcript>: how do i

04:16:58
<transcript>: How do I want to do this? The the transform. I think all of this is just be a string. I was dumb.

04:16:58
<transcript>: it was dumb

04:17:00
<transcript>: It was dumb. I didn't understand.

04:17:02
<transcript>: How I do.

04:17:02
<transcript>: okay

04:17:07
<transcript>: Okay. So transform this I'm gonna just do.

04:17:07
<transcript>: like this and we're

04:17:09
<transcript>: Like this. And we're gonna copy.

04:17:09
<transcript>: this whole thing

04:17:10
<transcript>: This whole thing.

04:17:10
<transcript>: right

04:17:12
<transcript>: Right.

04:17:19
<transcript>: It's gonna be transform.

04:17:24
<transcript>: Fat. And then a string. Oh, I just need to remove that transform.

04:17:26
<transcript>: And like that.

04:17:29
<transcript>: Right.

04:17:31
<transcript>: Oh.

04:17:38
<transcript>: Okay. Transform. Translate -25% let's see from zero to 100%. So.

04:17:42
<transcript>: This is not wiggle. This is appear.

04:17:47
<transcript>: And that one, too. And that one, two, 1 second. Ease in and out. Infinite.

04:17:56
<transcript>: So is there a 50%? No. It just goes straight to straight to the thing. So we're gonna translate to minus, maybe minus.

04:18:00
<transcript>: 50% maybe more than that actually.

04:18:03
<transcript>: Maybe a 150%. Let's just let's try that.

04:18:07
<transcript>: These are bad.

04:18:07
<transcript>: can't have those

04:18:08
<transcript>: Can't have those.

04:18:10
<transcript>: Let's see.

04:18:10
<transcript>: cubic

04:18:13
<transcript>: Cubic Bezier can't do that.

04:18:19
<transcript>: Okay. Does that all look good? I mix up for that last trailing.

04:18:23
<transcript>: Appear. Let's try it.

04:18:25
<transcript>: I need to restart.

04:18:28
<transcript>: I just happened.

04:18:28
<transcript>: big

04:18:29
<transcript>: Big.

04:18:31
<transcript>: White.

04:18:38
<transcript>: Okay. So let's use this animation. What do you say.

04:18:38
<transcript>: let's

04:18:41
<transcript>: Let's use it right here. Animate.

04:18:41
<transcript>: appear

04:18:42
<transcript>: Appear.

04:18:47
<transcript>: To look.

04:18:49
<transcript>: How does it look.

04:18:52
<transcript>: That's so slow.

04:18:52
<transcript>: ele

04:18:55
<transcript>: Elemental Server AppSync. I don't know what this is. App runner.

04:19:02
<transcript>: Oh, I didn't see it fade in at all. Does anyone see the font? I saw no text.

04:19:05
<transcript>: Migraine.

04:19:05
<transcript>: yeah it's not even

04:19:08
<transcript>: Yeah, it's not even showing up now.

04:19:08
<transcript>: that feels

04:19:09
nexxeln: fun fact: NotLikeThis is Aaron Swartz's brother

04:19:10
<transcript>: That feels bad? Amplify.

04:19:12
<transcript>: No.

04:19:14
<transcript>: Fun fact.

04:19:19
<transcript>: Who is Aaron Schwartz's brother? Not like this. That person.

04:19:20
okufa_f: is statmuse infra primarly built in node?

04:19:22
<transcript>: Thanks to follow.

04:19:22
<transcript>: rowan

04:19:24
<transcript>: Rowan, Rowan.

04:19:25
nexxeln: yeah

04:19:35
<transcript>: Is Sadi zip for primary builtin node. Actually it's a it's a weird collection of technology. So the web piece of the infra for statmes is elixir.

04:19:35
<transcript>: it's a phoenix

04:19:37
<transcript>: It's a Phoenix app.

04:19:39
<transcript>: And then.

04:19:39
<transcript>: the

04:19:45
<transcript>: The natural language stuff is like F sharp, which is obscure.

04:19:48
<transcript>: But all the NLP stuff is written in F sharp.

04:19:51
<transcript>: Interesting.

04:19:52
nexxeln: f# damn

04:20:00
<transcript>: So why am I not seeing my thing now that anime appear is there.

04:20:00
<transcript>: we have

04:20:04
<transcript>: We have zero to 100% translate -150%.

04:20:04
<transcript>: wait wait

04:20:07
<transcript>: Wait, wait. Zero to 100%.

04:20:09
<transcript>: No, that's not how this works.

04:20:09
<transcript>: the keyfram

04:20:11
<transcript>: The keyframes work like.

04:20:18
<transcript>: I don't remember how keyframes work. It's like you have zero and then you have 100%, so this should be 0%.

04:20:22
<transcript>: I know this should be a hundred percent.

04:20:22
<transcript>: and then

04:20:25
<transcript>: And then 0% should be like.

04:20:31
<transcript>: Translate y nothing.

04:20:38
<transcript>: Is this? I don't know. Is this right.

04:20:42
<transcript>: Let's try it.

04:20:47
<transcript>: Key spaces. I don't know if it'll actually work now.

04:20:49
<transcript>: What was that.

04:21:06
<transcript>: Think Box Stoke, there it goes. You see it, look, it go, it just needs to do it once, though. Shouldn't be looping. I think I have it on Infinite. Yeah.

04:21:12
<transcript>: He's in and out. I don't know if I want that either.

04:21:17
<transcript>: We just wanted to do it one time. So what is this one.

04:21:17
<transcript>: resili

04:21:19
<transcript>: Resilient tub.

04:21:19
<transcript>: something

04:21:20
<transcript>: Something like this.

04:21:23
<transcript>: How do I make it stay.

04:21:26
<transcript>: So there's infinite.

04:21:29
<transcript>: What are the other options here.

04:21:33
natenorberg: animation fill mode

04:21:33
<transcript>: I don't want it to keep a looping. I want it to just.

04:21:35
<transcript>: Stop.

04:21:35
<transcript>: css

04:21:37
<transcript>: Css, animation.

04:21:37
<transcript>: stop

04:21:39
<transcript>: Stop.

04:21:41
<transcript>: Bill mode is what it's called.

04:21:41
<transcript>: nate

04:21:43
<transcript>: Nate, thank you so much.

04:21:48
<transcript>: This is called fill mode animation filmo.

04:21:54
<transcript>: I like it so there's none forwards, backwards, both.

04:21:58
<transcript>: Is it none.

04:22:00
okufa_f: why don't you like the animation libraries? just difficult usage?

04:22:01
<transcript>: So I just want none.

04:22:02
natenorberg: i think you want both

04:22:11
<transcript>: Why don't you like the animation libraries? Just difficult usage. Yeah, it's not been like quick for me to pick up. Maybe there's a theme here. Maybe I don't pick up on stuff quickly because of me.

04:22:14
<transcript>: There's my fault.

04:22:16
<transcript>: It could be.

04:22:20
<transcript>: Could be me could be an me issue.

04:22:20
<transcript>: i think you want

04:22:23
<transcript>: I think you want both. So if I do both here.

04:22:23
okufa_f: no, i agree, the usage isn't intuitive

04:22:27
<transcript>: And that's what I'm looking for.

04:22:30
nexxeln: framer-motion is quite declaritive as opposed to react-spring

04:22:32
<transcript>: What is this.

04:22:35
okufa_f: lot of headaches and doc wrangling to just get up and started

04:22:36
<transcript>: Polly.

04:22:36
<transcript>: yeah

04:22:39
<transcript>: Yeah. Oh, it worked. Okay. So it's going too far.

04:22:39
<transcript>: let's

04:22:42
<transcript>: Let's go up here and let's say.

04:22:45
<transcript>: 50%.

04:22:45
<transcript>: we

04:22:48
<transcript>: We need to do the also the opacity.

04:22:54
<transcript>: And opacity.

04:22:56
<transcript>: Starts at 100.

04:23:01
<transcript>: Maybe.

04:23:07
<transcript>: Frame Remotion is quite declarative, as opposed to react spring.

04:23:17
<transcript>: A lot of headaches and Doc wrangling. Just to just go up and start. Yeah, I've just not had a good time. Did I do this wrong? Can I not do Opacity here? What did I do.

04:23:22
<transcript>: That's a new zero. Well, what's from.

04:23:26
nexxeln: brb after dinner

04:23:26
<transcript>: Sort of breaks on something module build failed.

04:23:31
<transcript>: Oh, it's better now. Okay. So ball. Right.

04:23:31
<transcript>: yeah let's

04:23:33
<transcript>: Yeah. Let's get in there.

04:23:34
natenorberg: is it because it only goes to 1?

04:23:37
<transcript>: What is this.

04:23:41
<transcript>: Genomics no batch.

04:23:41
<transcript>: oh that's

04:23:48
<transcript>: Oh, that's not good. So when it's when the score is zero, we're just rendering it.

04:23:50
<transcript>: Badly.

04:23:50
<transcript>: we're rendering

04:23:55
<transcript>: We're rendering it badly. So it's greater than zero. We do that.

04:23:55
<transcript>: how

04:23:59
<transcript>: How did that happen? Oh, if it's zero. Yeah. Okay.

04:24:01
<transcript>: We want to do.

04:24:01
<transcript>: like

04:24:02
<transcript>: Like.

04:24:02
<transcript>: this

04:24:04
<transcript>: This.

04:24:06
<transcript>: But not undefined.

04:24:09
<transcript>: Is that right? Is that what I want.

04:24:09
<transcript>: if i got to

04:24:12
<transcript>: If I got to get this one wrong, that's not amplify.

04:24:16
<transcript>: So the score didn't change so it shouldn't do anything.

04:24:16
<transcript>: yeah

04:24:17
<transcript>: Yeah.

04:24:17
<transcript>: that makes sense

04:24:19
<transcript>: That makes sense.

04:24:24
<transcript>: It squirt out to zero. Wait. Did I just actually fix something? Or am I done.

04:24:31
<transcript>: I don't know why it worked, but it seems so worked with cloud search.

04:24:35
<transcript>: Quantum Ledger database.

04:24:35
<transcript>: plus

04:24:39
<transcript>: Plus two. Okay. The Animation's still pretty bad. We're gonna make it faster.

04:24:46
<transcript>: I don't know what this one is. It's probably the one I've never heard of.

04:24:48
<transcript>: That is glue.

04:24:55
<transcript>: Okay. How do we feel about this? Is it? Is it improving.

04:24:55
<transcript>: we're going

04:24:57
<transcript>: We're going in the right direction.

04:25:06
<transcript>: I think so.

04:25:13
<transcript>: Is it because it only goes to one.

04:25:23
<transcript>: I don't know why that's it why it made the zero not show up.

04:25:23
<transcript>: because

04:25:27
<transcript>: Because if I guess if score Delta was zero.

04:25:27
<transcript>: should have rendered that

04:25:29
<transcript>: Should have rendered that thing at all right.

04:25:36
<transcript>: But why did saying not not.

04:25:36
<transcript>: why did that fix

04:25:38
<transcript>: Why did that fix it.

04:25:38
<transcript>: and more importantly

04:25:42
<transcript>: And more importantly, why did I think that would fix it because apparently it did. But.

04:25:44
<transcript>: Why.

04:25:45
<transcript>: Activate.

04:25:48
<transcript>: Certificate Manager no.

04:25:54
<transcript>: Is it is a certificate manager of a star on it. I guess it does.

04:25:57
<transcript>: Okay, let's make the animation faster.

04:26:01
<transcript>: So not 1 second. Let's say.

04:26:04
<transcript>: I say Zero five here? Or do I just do, like.

04:26:06
<transcript>: Do I do like.

04:26:09
<transcript>: 500.

04:26:09
<transcript>: no

04:26:13
<transcript>: No. 5 seconds like that.

04:26:17
<transcript>: Sucked about the web and about the browser is like.

04:26:17
<transcript>: is this my

04:26:21
<transcript>: Is this my work? And then find out, like, oh, you can't do it that way in Firefox.

04:26:21
<transcript>: you have to use millise

04:26:23
<transcript>: You have to use milliseconds or something.

04:26:23
<transcript>: that's

04:26:24
<transcript>: That's laugh, right.

04:26:24
<transcript>: oh that's

04:26:27
<transcript>: Oh, that's fast, that's too fast.

04:26:27
<transcript>: or it's

04:26:29
<transcript>: Or it's moving too much.

04:26:35
<transcript>: I'd be moving to it just corrido because Java you get it.

04:26:36
<transcript>: Let's try this again.

04:26:39
<transcript>: Simply Mail service.

04:26:43
<transcript>: It's not terrible. There's still something weird about it. I think it should probably.

04:26:55
<transcript>: It should like, wax and wane on the opacity. I think it should start at zero, go to one, and then come back down, like in the middle. So the keyframe 50%, yeah, Yeah.

04:26:58
<transcript>: Let's see over here.

04:26:58
<transcript>: let's say

04:26:59
<transcript>: Let's say.

04:27:03
<transcript>: 50%.

04:27:07
<transcript>: So Opacity starts at zero.

04:27:09
<transcript>: Or.

04:27:09
<transcript>: fifty

04:27:14
<transcript>: 50 goes to 100 and goes down to zero. What if we did like that.

04:27:20
<transcript>: And I need to work on the busier curves. I think they're weird.

04:27:20
<transcript>: code

04:27:21
<transcript>: Code build.

04:27:24
<transcript>: Now, that's bad.

04:27:24
<transcript>: so it was

04:27:26
<transcript>: So it was 100%.

04:27:30
<transcript>: And then it goes back down to 50, maybe or 25.

04:27:38
<transcript>: Let's see.

04:27:41
mattmancodes: opacity is 0-1

04:27:43
<transcript>: Deep learning in it.

04:27:46
<transcript>: That's a three.

04:27:52
<transcript>: Okay. That's a bad animation. That one was really bad. What did I do.

04:27:52
<transcript>: it goes

04:27:57
<transcript>: It goes down to 30. Is that not how it works? Is Opacity? Not a number.

04:28:01
<transcript>: Zero one. Oh, it's zero five. Okay. Yeah.

04:28:01
<transcript>: zero

04:28:03
<transcript>: Zero, five.

04:28:03
<transcript>: and then

04:28:04
<transcript>: And then.

04:28:08
<transcript>: Zero, five.

04:28:11
<transcript>: I'll show that.

04:28:20
<transcript>: Side VPN Nope.

04:28:21
<transcript>: How's VPC.

04:28:24
<transcript>: Registry.

04:28:26
<transcript>: Got it.

04:28:26
<transcript>: so

04:28:30
natenorberg: the 100 needs to be a 1

04:28:31
<transcript>: So now it has to go down to zero. Yeah.

04:28:36
<transcript>: Go down to zero because it's only going.

04:28:45
<transcript>: I know this is all subjective, but it's gonna feel right at some point and it doesn't feel right right now. That's a neuron, no transit gateway.

04:28:49
<transcript>: Computeoptimizer.

04:28:52
<transcript>: No time SDK man.

04:28:56
<transcript>: Emr.

04:28:56
<transcript>: there we

04:29:00
<transcript>: There we go. Oh, it's not animated. All.

04:29:04
<transcript>: There it goes. I was just so fast.

04:29:18
<transcript>: Then do I want ease in and out.

04:29:20
<transcript>: Just ease out.

04:29:26
<transcript>: I've got these busier curves. I think I should just take the Bezier curves out.

04:29:30
<transcript>: Yeah.

04:29:34
<transcript>: I guess I should do that.

04:29:38
<transcript>: I think that's better.

04:29:38
natenorberg: ooh, could you add scale(0.8) to the 0% frame?

04:29:40
<transcript>: Think so.

04:29:43
<transcript>: Paste is zero to one. Yeah.

04:29:43
<transcript>: the one hundred

04:29:53
<transcript>: The 100 needs to be a one. Thank you. Could you add scales zero eight to the 0% frame? Oh, yeah, yeah. Make it grow. Good idea. Great. I.

04:29:53
<transcript>: clap map

04:29:54
<transcript>: Clap, map.

04:29:54
<transcript>: yeah that's

04:29:57
<transcript>: Yeah, that's looking better, right? That was looking better.

04:29:59
<transcript>: That's a snowball.

04:29:59
<transcript>: now if we have

04:30:01
<transcript>: Now if we have it grow Yeah.

04:30:06
<transcript>: Does that go inside the transform? It does, right? Yeah.

04:30:08
<transcript>: Scale.

04:30:11
<transcript>: Zero, eight.

04:30:17
<transcript>: Then it'll just go to one. Is it just automatically go to one. I don't have to.

04:30:19
<transcript>: Say something.

04:30:24
<transcript>: Oh, Jesus, Oh, Geez, I don't know what this is.

04:30:30
<transcript>: I have T Analytics now deep lens.

04:30:34
<transcript>: Chime Voice Connector I want to say, oh, yeah, that's looking good.

04:30:39
<transcript>: But did it do the grow? It's not growing.

04:30:39
<transcript>: think of the

04:30:41
<transcript>: Think of the follow Exotic burger.

04:30:43
natenorberg: i think you need to put scale(1) in the next frame, but it'll stay after that

04:30:44
<transcript>: It's my skill not working. Did I do something wrong here.

04:30:48
<transcript>: So you need to put scale one in the next frame.

04:30:48
<transcript>: okay

04:30:51
<transcript>: Okay. But it'll say after that. Cool.

04:30:53
<transcript>: One.

04:30:55
<transcript>: Oh, that's the wrong frame.

04:30:59
natenorberg: i think it's always scalled down now

04:31:06
<transcript>: What.

04:31:10
<transcript>: Oh, there's two. Sorry, there's two S's.

04:31:13
<transcript>: Okay.

04:31:24
<transcript>: I'm gonna have to go here pretty soon. I think DAX is straight. So we're gonna raid DAX.

04:31:26
<transcript>: Can't wait.

04:31:26
<transcript>: gen

04:31:32
<transcript>: Genomics Cloud wand. Okay, that was a little fast or something.

04:31:32
<transcript>: storage

04:31:34
<transcript>: Storage gateway.

04:31:38
<transcript>: What's going on? There something looks bad now.

04:31:41
<transcript>: Translate y scale one.

04:31:45
<transcript>: Let's make it more dramatic.

04:31:48
<transcript>: See if that helps me tell what's going on.

04:31:53
<transcript>: I have no idea what this twin maker.

04:31:56
<transcript>: No, it's not doing the scale.

04:31:58
<transcript>: That's always scaled down. Now.

04:32:01
<transcript>: So it's not going to scale one.

04:32:06
<transcript>: Is there any scale examples in here.

04:32:09
<transcript>: At Scale two.

04:32:12
<transcript>: That's growing.

04:32:16
<transcript>: Transform scale.

04:32:23
<transcript>: What do we think.

04:32:23
<transcript>: why is

04:32:26
<transcript>: Why is it not scaling up.

04:32:29
<transcript>: Transform at 50% scale one.

04:32:35
natenorberg: oh, there should only be one semicolon when there's multiple transforms

04:32:36
<transcript>: I do 10.

04:32:40
<transcript>: Seems unlikely to be the issue, but.

04:32:45
<transcript>: I don't know what this is.

04:32:45
<transcript>: sumerian

04:32:46
<transcript>: Sumerian.

04:32:46
<transcript>: yeah

04:32:47
<transcript>: Yeah.

04:32:47
<transcript>: should only

04:32:51
<transcript>: Should only be one semicolon when there's multiple transforms Oh.

04:32:55
<transcript>: That's the issue.

04:32:59
<transcript>: Okay, that's the issue.

04:33:02
<transcript>: Good call.

04:33:10
<transcript>: I have no idea. Migration. Evaluator.

04:33:14
<transcript>: So many hard ones.

04:33:20
<transcript>: Transfer family. There it is. Okay. I didn't watch it closely enough. I need to actually know the answer so I can quickly.

04:33:25
<transcript>: Not looking.

04:33:25
<transcript>: okay

04:33:27
<transcript>: Okay. I'm gonna look. Detective. Here we go.

04:33:27
<transcript>: oh yeah

04:33:30
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. Okay. So it's growing.

04:33:30
<transcript>: too

04:33:32
<transcript>: Too fast.

04:33:36
<transcript>: I think I need to do.

04:33:39
<transcript>: Scale one here. Like it scales.

04:33:43
<transcript>: Whole time over the whole draguration.

04:33:45
<transcript>: Maybe.

04:33:50
<transcript>: Private link.

04:33:54
<transcript>: So it needs to start at like.

04:33:54
<transcript>: oh you said

04:33:57
<transcript>: Oh, you said .8 yeah, not at zero four.

04:34:06
<transcript>: Is kind of long. Yeah. Hey, that's looking pretty good.

04:34:06
<transcript>: that's looking

04:34:08
<transcript>: That's looking pretty good.

04:34:10
<transcript>: Think box.

04:34:12
<transcript>: Yeah.

04:34:20
<transcript>: What's it need, it just needs something, just a little bit of something else. It has ease out on which I think is really.

04:34:25
<transcript>: Lingers too long. It's just not fast enough.

04:34:25
<transcript>: let's see

04:34:28
<transcript>: Let's see. Cost profiler.

04:34:32
cowfacedude99: scale(1.5)?

04:34:32
<transcript>: Time stream. Here we go.

04:34:35
candlecan: confetti.js is what it needs

04:34:37
<transcript>: I think it's just. This is not quite. Oh, go, bigger.

04:34:41
<transcript>: Confetti is what it needs. Ooh.

04:34:41
<transcript>: confetti

04:34:43
<transcript>: Confetti. Does it need confetti.

04:34:45
<transcript>: Think.

04:34:45
<transcript>: think box

04:34:47
<transcript>: Think Box Frost.

04:34:52
<transcript>: Maybe just a little faster or you think it should scale up to one, five.

04:34:57
<transcript>: Try it. I think that's gonna be a little dramatic.

04:34:59
<transcript>: Let's see.

04:35:02
<transcript>: Game kit.

04:35:06
<transcript>: Too big. Oh, maybe not. I don't know. Maybe it should get bigger.

04:35:12
<transcript>: Something needs to change though. It's it's something's just a little.

04:35:15
<transcript>: Off.

04:35:18
<transcript>: Does it need a buzzier curve of some sort.

04:35:28
<transcript>: Through and from Opacity. So it's changing Opacity at 50%, it hits 100% opacity. Maybe we'll make that.

04:35:32
<transcript>: What.

04:35:32
<transcript>: thirty percent

04:35:33
<transcript>: 30%.

04:35:35
<transcript>: So it quickly hits that.

04:35:35
<transcript>: maybe

04:35:41
<transcript>: Maybe we go to instead of five. We go to 1.3.

04:35:44
<transcript>: Translate.

04:35:53
<transcript>: Maybe needs a move less.

04:35:55
natenorberg: i personally liked it a bit better when it stopped scaling at 50%, but that's probably just me

04:35:57
<transcript>: And move less and good, all faster.

04:36:03
<transcript>: Five. Let's try all that.

04:36:07
<transcript>: Sage maker.

04:36:13
<transcript>: That's too fast. It doesn't linger. I guess that's just a side.

04:36:13
<transcript>: just need to

04:36:16
<transcript>: Just need to be longer. Like it was.

04:36:16
<transcript>: but maybe

04:36:19
<transcript>: But maybe it needs to like.

04:36:19
<transcript>: not get

04:36:22
<transcript>: Not get to its destination if you know what I mean.

04:36:29
<transcript>: What's wrong with that or something wrong with it? You'd like to bit better when it stops scaling at 50%, but that's just me.

04:36:33
<transcript>: Stop scaling oh, Yeah.

04:36:40
<transcript>: Upscaling. Yeah, I think you're right. I think it needs to get to its size.

04:36:47
<transcript>: A little faster.

04:36:52
<transcript>: And full of.

04:36:56
<transcript>: And then.

04:36:59
<transcript>: It goes 30%.

04:37:10
<transcript>: Goes to 33%.

04:37:16
<transcript>: Does it go to passive zero? I think that's okay.

04:37:24
<transcript>: What is this elastic inferance no parallel cluster that makes sense.

04:37:32
<transcript>: None bad at this. Not that.

04:37:32
<transcript>: wow

04:37:36
<transcript>: Wow, these have all been hard medium package.

04:37:38
<transcript>: There we go.

04:37:38
<transcript>: i'm

04:37:42
<transcript>: I'm now it's got too much of a like.

04:37:45
<transcript>: What's wrong with it now? It's not moving enough.

04:37:56
<transcript>: Does it if I do it like this does. This means translate. Won't change until it gets past 40% and then it'll start climbing as that what just happened. Let's see.

04:38:00
<transcript>: It's like it's like it's sizing up.

04:38:04
natenorberg: yeah i think so

04:38:06
<transcript>: I don't know what any of these are.

04:38:06
<transcript>: there

04:38:08
<transcript>: There we go.

04:38:11
<transcript>: Yeah. You think so? So we need to add the.

04:38:23
<transcript>: Maybe it should just be done. Maybe there shouldn't be three steps to this. Maybe it should just be done. Oh, yeah? The scale shouldn't change after this.

04:38:26
<transcript>: That was a mistake. I just missed that.

04:38:31
<transcript>: But also.

04:38:31
<transcript>: maybe

04:38:36
<transcript>: Maybe it should just be done. Maybe it's just the translate.

04:38:38
<transcript>: Y.

04:38:40
<transcript>: 33%.

04:38:42
<transcript>: And just.

04:38:45
<transcript>: Like that.

04:38:49
<transcript>: What's that look like.

04:38:59
<transcript>: Why would I do that? Why not just do 100%? Then I'm confusing myself.

04:39:02
<transcript>: What.

04:39:04
<transcript>: Am I doing.

04:39:04
<transcript>: maybe i'm just

04:39:07
<transcript>: Maybe I'm just trying to say, should it be 100%.

04:39:10
<transcript>: Should it just be like this.

04:39:12
<transcript>: Have it.

04:39:15
<transcript>: More subtle.

04:39:15
<transcript>: yeah less

04:39:18
<transcript>: Yeah. Less is more with animation, right? Zero to -33%.

04:39:18
<transcript>: it's

04:39:20
<transcript>: It's sealing up.

04:39:30
<transcript>: Location, service.

04:39:32
<transcript>: That's more subtle.

04:39:32
<transcript>: definitely that one

04:39:34
<transcript>: Definitely that one lingers too long.

04:39:39
<transcript>: Oh, and that's the trick. I think I just need it to.

04:39:45
<transcript>: Fade out quicker so maybe I do yeah we're getting there.

04:39:45
<transcript>: we're gonna say

04:39:48
<transcript>: We're gonna say that's 50 or.

04:39:48
<transcript>: sixty

04:39:50
<transcript>: 60%.

04:39:52
<transcript>: And then.

04:39:57
<transcript>: We're gonna say, at 100%, we got to Opacity zero.

04:40:03
<transcript>: Okay.

04:40:07
<transcript>: Numbers.

04:40:10
<transcript>: Like that.

04:40:12
<transcript>: Looks like.

04:40:16
<transcript>: New game.

04:40:20
<transcript>: Worked box.

04:40:22
<transcript>: Whoa, no, that's alright.

04:40:25
<transcript>: Launch Wizard.

04:40:25
<transcript>: yeah it's pop

04:40:27
<transcript>: Yeah, it's popping back down.

04:40:36
<transcript>: We need to stay at that level.

04:40:40
<transcript>: Enclave.

04:40:40
<transcript>: okay

04:40:44
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah. That's. That's better. This just needs to be.

04:40:46
<transcript>: Longer.

04:40:53
<transcript>: Studio.

04:40:57
<transcript>: I just need to hang on a little bit longer.

04:41:00
<transcript>: What is that.

04:41:07
<transcript>: Control tower. What is not hanging on long enough.

04:41:07
<transcript>: deep composer

04:41:08
<transcript>: Deep composer.

04:41:12
<transcript>: So it needs to be faster.

04:41:19
<transcript>: To get to the spot and then stay there longer. What would that mean? That means dropping that number.

04:41:23
<transcript>: So I'm.

04:41:28
<transcript>: Not. I think oh, I love this one. Lumberyard.

04:41:35
<transcript>: Okay. I'm gonna mess with this offstream. I think that's probably enough for today.

04:41:38
<transcript>: It's definitely enough for today's 1030 Oh.

04:41:41
<transcript>: Need to take a actual break.

04:41:48
<transcript>: Step away. You eat something. It's been so much fun once again. Always is.

04:41:48
<transcript>: love

04:41:51
natenorberg: thanks for letting me play along

04:41:51
<transcript>: Love, love my time here on Twitch with you all.

04:42:04
<transcript>: We're gonna raid. I'm gonna cancel. Yeah, thanks for playing along, Nate. I'm going to cancel whatever auto raid pops up, and we're gonna read DAX because I like DAX.

04:42:04
<transcript>: cool

04:42:07
<transcript>: Cool. It's been fun. Maybe we do again sometime.

16:49:52
<transcript>: We have got.

16:49:54
<transcript>: Everyone.

16:49:57
<transcript>: An inch anchor.

16:50:53
<transcript>: They're only good for cutting tape.

16:51:33
<transcript>: Hey, boys.

17:01:10
<transcript>: Hey 1 second I'm trying to get my headphones.

17:01:14
<transcript>: Hey, can you hear me.

<transcript>: Are you small ones? I said.

17:02:10
<transcript>: Hey, sorry, my kids are in mouth. I was trying to get Lara bars.

17:03:09
<transcript>: Good.

17:03:09
<transcript>: so

17:03:18
<transcript>: So I realized this is the first time I've done this. You called on signal, and it like rang on my phone without me even having a single open app or the app open.

17:03:18
<transcript>: and now

17:03:24
<transcript>: And now I don't have to have, like, I can just have my phone sitting here and you can still hear me, right? Like.

17:03:24
<transcript>: my screen

17:03:27
<transcript>: My screen is unlocked. That's awesome. Okay.

17:03:41
<transcript>: Oh really.

17:03:46
<transcript>: I'm learning this stuff all the time.

17:04:01
<transcript>: Oh, nice, Yeah.

17:04:13
<transcript>: Wow. So that's why I get all the nonsense.

17:04:21
<transcript>: Yeah, no, it's awesome.

17:04:26
<transcript>: I guess so many dumb like fake calls. Sorry, go ahead.

17:04:37
<transcript>: What in the world like did you see his Twitter? Have you watched? Like what he's been.

17:05:00
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:05:00
<transcript>: and and did

17:05:08
<transcript>: And and did the so there I saw one day I haven't followed up and read anything else since then, but I saw where they were saying like this. They were tracing all these transactions.

17:05:08
<transcript>: and all the

17:05:12
<transcript>: And all the money was like flowing out of these places within the FTX accounts.

17:05:12
<transcript>: did he just like

17:05:15
<transcript>: Did he just like funnel it all out or what happened.

17:05:45
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:06:38
<transcript>: What.

17:06:55
<transcript>: Wow.

17:08:22
<transcript>: My word.

17:08:30
<transcript>: Yeah, I saw that chart.

17:08:38
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:09:17
<transcript>: Wow.

17:10:59
<transcript>: So is there is there any world where he gets away with all this because of some tax structure law of whatever legal entities or something.

17:11:16
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:12:04
<transcript>: Oh really.

17:13:21
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:14:50
<transcript>: And just the way he's acting on Twitter is so bizarre.

17:14:54
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:15:13
<transcript>: Oh, yeah? I know who's on that.

17:15:37
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:15:53
<transcript>: I'm not familiar.

17:16:04
<transcript>: Okay.

17:16:14
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:16:39
<transcript>: Right.

17:16:57
<transcript>: Yep.

17:18:47
<transcript>: Wow.

17:18:47
<transcript>: yeah

17:18:49
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:19:26
<transcript>: So bizarre.

17:19:49
<transcript>: Did he flee? Did he flee? And, like, fly from the Bahamas to somewhere. I saw something about his playing track.

17:20:32
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:20:54
<transcript>: What.

17:20:54
<transcript>: does anyone have

17:20:56
<transcript>: Does Anyone have any series.

17:21:05
<transcript>: Just to make sure they were Yeah.

17:21:10
<transcript>: Wild. This whole thing is so wild.

17:21:21
<transcript>: Yeah, right.

17:21:44
<transcript>: Yeah, that's the crazy, like reading all the people that invested like Sequoia and all these people and just the lack of lack of diligence.

17:21:44
<transcript>: i read a bunch

17:21:46
<transcript>: I read a bunch of that stuff.

17:22:25
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:22:25
<transcript>: yeah the

17:22:28
<transcript>: Yeah, the old way. Yep.

17:22:42
<transcript>: Yup.

17:22:51
<transcript>: Oh no.

17:23:10
<transcript>: You told me a bit about it. Yeah.

17:24:27
<transcript>: I don't know what to think.

17:24:30
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:24:42
<transcript>: I really hope to see like a big hammer come down.

17:24:58
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:25:15
<transcript>: Oh, I'm sure just the people who lost their money. Yeah.

17:25:33
<transcript>: Oh, my word.

17:25:40
<transcript>: Yeah. There's some serious money and power that are not happy with them. Right.

17:25:46
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:26:10
<transcript>: I've got time. I've got an hour and a half is if you've got it.

17:26:13
<transcript>: Alright. Right. Yeah.

17:26:28
<transcript>: One thing before before I forget. And like, we're gonna probably talk about a lot of different stuff. I don't know if I've told you I'm going to reinvent, which is like the AWS conference in Vegas.

17:26:28
<transcript>: what's

17:26:29
<transcript>: What's? That.

17:26:31
<transcript>: Invite in Vegas.

17:26:34
<transcript>: It's in like.

17:26:42
<transcript>: Two week or week and a half. Not it's like the 28 November through the second December, so it's like not next week, but the next week.

17:26:49
<transcript>: That all the heroes go for free, like they pay for us to go and there's like a big hero dinner and all this stuff.

17:27:10
<transcript>: Yeah. I mean, I can talk to Casey. And if you come to Vegas, that'd be cool. I like it's a whole week there. And I don't know how much like the conference is. Whatever. I'm excited to meet a lot of the people that I've kind of like.

17:27:10
<transcript>: interact

17:27:12
<transcript>: Interacted with on Twitter or whatever.

17:27:12
<transcript>: but

17:27:18
<transcript>: But I don't know. Yeah? How much the time will be filled? Like, I'd love to hang out if you could come down how far is that for you.

17:27:23
<transcript>: Oh, really? Yeah.

17:27:33
<transcript>: Cool. Yeah. No, I. It'd be super cool. It's just kinda short notice. Sorry. I should have told you sooner. It's actually the first time.

17:27:33
<transcript>: it's

17:27:44
<transcript>: It's the first time I traveled the Eli since. Like probably whenever we traveled last together. Like I haven't traveled since before the 2020. Stuff. Like I haven't traveled at all. Not been on a plane.

17:27:44
<transcript>: i've not got

17:27:45
<transcript>: I've not gotten anywhere.

17:27:49
<transcript>: Oh, really? That's actually.

17:27:58
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:28:17
<transcript>: You were traveling so much like a few years ago. I remember how nuts that was.

17:28:22
<transcript>: Exactly.

17:28:22
<transcript>: exactly

17:28:23
<transcript>: Exactly.

17:28:31
<transcript>: Yeah, I'll sit on signal right now.

17:28:55
<transcript>: Yeah like other people could.

17:29:06
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:29:09
<transcript>: All right, I'm pediatric.

17:29:09
<transcript>: yeah

17:29:11
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm doing right now.

17:29:23
<transcript>: Yeah. So Monday.

17:29:23
<transcript>: there's

17:29:25
<transcript>: There's like Monday night.

17:29:32
<transcript>: Monday night, Monday nights, the Hero dinner. So that's the only thing like I have on the schedule for, like an evening.

17:29:32
<transcript>: that it

17:29:34
<transcript>: That it's just all that.

17:29:34
<transcript>: yeah

17:29:41
<transcript>: Yeah, all database heroes. But then every other night, like I have no plan. I just plan to meet as many of the people.

17:29:41
<transcript>: in nativeist

17:29:43
<transcript>: In nativeist communities. I can, but that's it.

17:29:54
<transcript>: Oh, that'd be awesome. Yeah, I just. I pasted it into signal. Let me make sure those are right. Actually.

17:30:01
<transcript>: Oh Yeah.

17:30:06
<transcript>: Perfect.

17:30:21
<transcript>: Oh, it's not. I can't keep up with AI stuff. It's nuts.

17:30:42
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:30:47
<transcript>: Yeah, I saw somebody.

17:30:47
<transcript>: had posted

17:30:51
<transcript>: Had posted. It was like a Twitter thread that was like 90.

17:30:51
<transcript>: breakthroughs

17:30:52
<transcript>: Breakthroughs in 90 days.

17:30:52
<transcript>: they just docum

17:31:01
<transcript>: They just documented, like every day for 90 days, breakthroughs in AI, which is just kind of bananas. What do you think? I mean, Tech moves fast, but that's just.

17:31:09
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:31:41
<transcript>: Oh no.

17:31:41
<transcript>: they want to know

17:31:44
<transcript>: They want to know they exist for a while.

17:31:57
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:33:22
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, I just saw it's like the Heroes have a block. Hang on, let me find it.

17:33:25
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:33:30
<transcript>: I think the Venetian, I think Let me.

17:33:30
<transcript>: let me

17:33:32
<transcript>: Let me double check here.

17:33:45
<transcript>: Let me find it here. It's somewhere in here. I know, I got they have such a weird off system. Aws says.

17:33:51
<transcript>: Remember how bad Microsoft was when we were on Azure.

17:33:56
<transcript>: Oh, Geez, Yeah.

17:33:58
<transcript>: Oh, terrible.

17:34:03
<transcript>: Let's see. I'm gonna find it. Yeah. The Venetian, I think.

17:34:03
<transcript>: yeah

17:34:04
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:34:12
<transcript>: I'm never been to Vegas. This is my first time going to Vegas.

17:34:22
<transcript>: Oh, you kind of cut out What'd you say.

17:34:25
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:34:31
<transcript>: Okay. They're like the buildings are connected.

17:34:57
<transcript>: No, just me.

17:35:07
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:35:18
<transcript>: That's awesome.

17:36:26
<transcript>: Zero.

17:36:42
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:36:52
<transcript>: Wow.

17:37:10
<transcript>: The earlier.

17:37:12
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:37:30
<transcript>: Yeah. I already sent you the dates.

17:38:00
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:38:10
<transcript>: Oh Yeah.

17:38:48
<transcript>: Right.

17:39:13
<transcript>: Yeah, Yep.

<transcript>: Right.

17:40:33
<transcript>: Yep.

17:41:44
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:42:18
<transcript>: Link Share, Link share.

17:42:26
<transcript>: Yeah, it was like Affiliate Links, but basically they gave $5 for everybody who signed up with your link.

17:42:40
<transcript>: Right.

17:42:57
<transcript>: Yep.

17:46:09
<transcript>: And an international too like people.

17:46:19
<transcript>: Yeah. And like, people internationally. It's it's crazy how many really young international folks, like, Join My Stream. And they're super talented. And they have open source work. They've done.

17:46:19
<transcript>: that's insane

17:46:29
<transcript>: That's insane. Like I'm Super encouraged on that front. Like, for all of the world, the people that are really taking advantage of this new paradigm, I guess.

17:46:52
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:51:15
<transcript>: Nice.

17:51:15
<transcript>: that's awesome

17:51:16
<transcript>: That's awesome.

17:52:00
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:52:39
<transcript>: I gotta tell you it's so pertinent? Here on Stream today.

17:52:39
<transcript>: somebody

17:52:45
<transcript>: Somebody joined and said, Wait, you're a cofounder of staff because it just says so in my like, on my Twitch. I think.

17:52:45
<transcript>: and

17:52:46
<transcript>: And.

17:52:46
<transcript>: it turned out

17:52:57
<transcript>: It turned out I think this person was just a Savvies fan and had been for a long time even said at some point in the stream like, Man, I wish you had streaks. I thought like how many times we heard.

17:52:57
<transcript>: how it

17:52:59
<transcript>: How it definitely hurt.

17:52:59
<transcript>: yeah

17:53:01
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:53:01
<transcript>: exactly

17:53:12
<transcript>: Exactly. Yeah. So I, like, went into a whole bunch of stuff on stage, and I've tried not to like, say much. I definitely haven't say anything on Twitter, but on stream, I feel like it's like a hundred people watching like, one of the chances.

17:53:17
<transcript>: Okay. Perfect.

17:53:24
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:53:38
<transcript>: So so I did say.

17:53:38
<transcript>: so i did

17:53:42
<transcript>: So I did say like I just I pulled up statmes and talked to a bunch of stuff.

17:53:42
<transcript>: because

17:53:44
<transcript>: Because this person actually knew what it was.

17:53:51
<transcript>: Yeah. And I mean, I like I mentioned I did not say I was rewriting it, but.

17:53:51
<transcript>: somebody

17:54:01
<transcript>: Somebody asked, what did somebody ask? Like there was a bunch of people really interested to hear more about Savvy's. I mean, it's people that have been on my stream, like, just interact with me a lot for the last few months.

17:54:02
<transcript>: So.

17:54:02
<transcript>: we

17:54:18
<transcript>: We talked about I kind of like, went into all of it just like, social and just like what it does on Google and all these things, just kind of walking through it all. And the same guy that started the conversation that came in and asked if I was a Cofounder, he said, Yo is statin. He's hiring.

17:54:22
<transcript>: I thought you would love that. Like it's. Exact.

17:54:22
<transcript>: situation

17:54:25
<transcript>: Situation played out right there.

17:54:34
<transcript>: Oh yeah? Like it's all engineers that follow me on.

17:54:43
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:54:48
<transcript>: It was awesome.

17:55:24
<transcript>: Yep.

17:55:44
<transcript>: I'm pumped.

17:56:14
<transcript>: Yeah, Yeah.

17:56:40
<transcript>: It's so funny. Like, all these talking points came up on stream. The guy asked, the same guy asked me, what do you think about the Stat Muse Social or what did you say, the statme Twitter presence? And I knew, like, when you asked that I just knew it was like a leading question into, like, you know, like, have you seen some of.

17:56:40
<transcript>: the backlash

17:56:42
<transcript>: The backlash or something.

17:56:42
<transcript>: and

17:56:43
<transcript>: And I kind of explained.

17:56:43
<transcript>: just

17:57:03
<transcript>: Just my thoughts on it like that we've definitely skewed too far towards, like, slandering other teams and doing things that make people feel bad. And just, like, talks about how, you know, fans are passionate. Like, it's just something people really care about. But in the end, he was like, yeah, no, I don't think it's bad at all. Like, I've seen like, I know some people don't like, but I think it's hilarious or something. He was saying.

17:57:03
<transcript>: something

17:57:08
<transcript>: Something about thought that like the Stammy's. Twitter was awesome. He loved the stats. He said.

17:57:25
