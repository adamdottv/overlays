<transcript>: So.

00:23:10
<transcript>: Did theo make fake voices? All the people that he put in there.

00:23:12
mehulsharmamat: but that's the best could be done

00:23:16
<transcript>: And I'm so unimpressed with this video. I'm not impressed. No, it's awesome.

00:23:18

00:23:27
<transcript>: Harry Potter. Balenciaga. Oh, is that what.

00:23:28
mehulsharmamat: yep that was elevenlabs + midjourney + d-id

00:23:32
thdxr: he had someone do this

00:23:33
<transcript>: I haven't seen all these balenciaga videos. No, you guys have.

00:23:33
<transcript>: it's

00:23:33
cosmiclasagna: I think everything in there is ai generated

00:23:36
<transcript>: It's a fashion brand. Okay.

00:23:39
mehulsharmamat: @thdxr that was me :))

00:23:39
cosmiclasagna: from picture to voices

00:23:42
<transcript>: What's that? Johnny depp? I'm just scrolling. Trying to get more context.

00:23:42
<transcript>: someone explained this

00:23:50
<transcript>: Someone explained this to me like, I'm five or like, I'd never have left the ozarks. So it's a fashion brand. And there's videos. People make like this.

00:23:50

00:24:00
pbertrand_dev: yeah pretty sure @mehulsharmamat  made it

00:24:00
<transcript>: Did the fashion brand make a video? And then everyone's, just like, parodying. Parroting. It parodying. It. Is that what happened.

00:24:03
cosmiclasagna: @mehulsharmamat omg where

00:24:03
<transcript>: Everything in there is AI generated.

00:24:03
<transcript>: from picture

00:24:07
<transcript>: From picture to voices. Wow, that's a lot of work.

00:24:10
earholesmcgee: Adam, youre kinda like a homeschool of the internet.

00:24:13
mehulsharmamat: @thdxr that is adam. it was hard to do adam EVEN when he has the best camera and stuff

00:24:14
<transcript>: Oh, Mayhew you made it wait what you made it Mayhel.

00:24:18
cosmiclasagna: I was joking adam mehul made it

00:24:22
mehulsharmamat: check the top comment @adamdotdev

00:24:22
<transcript>: Anime are kind of like a home school of the Internet. What does that mean.

00:24:27
<transcript>: That is Adam. It was hard to do Adam, even when he has the best camera and stuff.

00:24:31
kevinnaughtonjr: someone used ai to generate a bunch of random videos of stories involving balenciaga. i think they originally started with harry potter and balenciaga

00:24:33
<transcript>: So Mayhel you made this check the top comment.

00:24:33
<transcript>: oh

00:24:35
goodgrandpaa: @mehulsharmamat Respect!!

00:24:35
trivenge: lurking but casually here

00:24:43
<transcript>: Oh, mayhew worked incredibly hard on this, so please give him a follow and check out his latest YouTube video. No, it's very impressive. I need to understand more. You're here. You can give me some answers.

00:24:52
mehulsharmamat: yeap

00:24:55
<transcript>: So you generated the voices and the video. How in the world did you do all this? I know how you can make fake voices, but this is a lot of work. How many voices is that.

00:24:57
mehulsharmamat: elevenlabs for the voice

00:24:58
<transcript>: And then I have no idea how you did the video.

00:25:01
mehulsharmamat: midjourney for the art

00:25:03
cosmiclasagna: wait how did you make the pictures move

00:25:05
mehulsharmamat: studio d-id for the video

00:25:14
<transcript>: Oh I missed all this Mayhew where you're saying like I mean it was hard to make you all with mid journey but that's the best could be done. I missed all this where Male was explaining.

00:25:15
mehulsharmamat: @cosmiclasagna https://studio.d-id.com/editor

00:25:20
<transcript>: That he did this. So the second one was teage. Okay. So I got to watch it all now again.

00:25:33
<transcript>: I mean, that definitely looks like theo that's teach. The problem with this one being teach is it also looks like Danny postmo because the hair that looks just a lot like Danny, you had levels in there, so it's like it looks like Danny. I don't know.

00:25:38
<transcript>: The kin wheeler. This is my favorite. Right here.

00:25:44
thdxr: @adamdotdev remember i made a mid journey version of you?

00:25:45
cosmiclasagna: damn

00:25:51
<transcript>: I've seen kim's done some mid journey stuff or whatever stuff with him himself. I've seen some of the versions of him. I even have one on my phone because I was going to make a meme.

00:25:51
thdxr: i was thinking about doing the same thing

00:25:56
<transcript>: And they kind of look like this. I think he's got a very mid journey.

00:25:58
<transcript>: Face.

00:26:01
<transcript>: You can make things with it.

00:26:09
<transcript>: Is that mash bunny bash bunny? Right, I'm guessing Mayhew.

00:26:27
<transcript>: and

00:26:30
<transcript>: And okay, this is all very helpful.

00:26:42
<transcript>: How did you make the pictures move? That's what studio did, I guess. Remember, I made a mid journey version of you. I do remember yours, dax. Yours was pretty good. Dax. Cornell.

00:26:48
<transcript>: Cornell, thank you so much for the prime. Sub. Four prime. Subs in a row.

00:27:07

00:27:07
<transcript>: acknowledging

00:27:10
kornel571: hey! no problem, I love your twitter vids!

00:27:11
<transcript>: Acknowledging a prime sub as I do follow.

00:27:14
<transcript>: Like should they more should say more words.

00:27:14
<transcript>: also

00:27:17
<transcript>: Also in order of appearance. Oh, this is helpful. Mayhew.

00:27:17
<transcript>: you were going

00:27:32
mehulsharmamat: @sockthedev you can prompt it with multiple images

00:27:37
<transcript>: You were going to do the same thing, dax. Yeah, the one you made of me. Oh, you made a bunch of people. I remember seeing those. Okay, I see. How do you make people in mid journey? Can you give a reference photo or not? Like I know in Dream Studio. You can train it on someone's likeness. Oh, there's a bunch of okay, we're going to leave this. There's a bunch of.

00:27:37
<transcript>: me

00:27:39
<transcript>: Mes here.

00:27:41
cosmiclasagna: there's a /blend command

00:27:43
mehulsharmamat: it doesn't train tho it's pretty random

00:27:44
<transcript>: On Danny postman made this thing, and I bought it.

00:27:45
<transcript>: It's how I made.

00:27:49
<transcript>: The Adam, Kappa.

00:27:49

<transcript>: The Adam.

00:27:51
adamdotdev: adamdevKappa

00:27:54
thdxr: yeah can give a reference

00:28:01
cosmiclasagna: training is a whole different beast I think

00:28:03
sockthedev: ah rad

00:28:09
cosmiclasagna: thats so cool

00:28:11
<transcript>: This one. This was from this Danny postman thing. I think so. In order of appearance. Theo teas, Ken wheeler, primeage and bash bunny. Milky. Oh, milky. I want to watch again now. Trash rocks, codes. Oh, I missed that one. Okay. Adam levels. Jack forge, fireship. Oh, Jack forge. So here's me. As like every meme. Some of these are.

00:28:11
<transcript>: pretty cursed

00:28:12
schrew: Greg from succession vibes in the fourth image there

00:28:17
<transcript>: Pretty cursed. Just guard your eyes. Oh, you can give a reference in mid journey. Okay.

00:28:19
<transcript>: Some of these.

00:28:20
schrew: *5th

00:28:22
sockthedev: so you give multiple of the subject, and then one of the target (e.g. hulk) and do blend?

00:28:26
<transcript>: You'll never be able to unsee them. So I just would ask you to be careful and look away as quickly as possible.

00:28:26
<transcript>: i'm not

00:28:33
<transcript>: I'm not sure what this fellas got here. I know the pulp Fiction picture, but the extra gun. Not sure about that.

00:28:43
cosmiclasagna: lmao the kevin hart one LUL

00:28:44
<transcript>: Some of them aren't bad. Some of them actually look. And then some of them. I look more like dax than anything. It does not look like me. Looks like dax shaved and grew his hair out.

00:28:49
cosmiclasagna: bald adam

00:28:54
<transcript>: That does not look like me. That looks like I'm an old black man. I'm not an old black man. Some of me are just really creepy.

00:28:57
<transcript>: How does that involve me.

00:28:58
pbertrand_dev: are you sure?

00:28:59
<transcript>: Oh, man.

00:29:03
<transcript>: Cornell. Hey, no problem, love your Twitter bits. Thank you so much, Cornell.

00:29:07

thdxr: adam is doing black face

00:29:17
thdxr: omg

00:29:19
thdxr: cancel him

00:29:21
<transcript>: I appreciate that. It's weird. Like I've been doing them. We just were about to hit number 100. We just looked in my folder. I've done, like, 98 of them, and only in the last couple of weeks, I feel like people actually watch them and people actually appreciate them. I did them for a long time and no one really cared.

00:29:23
dmdboi: Unsubbed

00:29:24
sockthedev: hahaha

00:29:29
cosmiclasagna: lmaooo

00:29:33
<transcript>: But eventually you just annoy people and ask, Can you train mid journey on multiple images of your shelves that maintains lightness, you can prompt it with multiple images. Interesting. A blend command. It doesn't train, though. It's pretty random.

00:29:40
f0ll0w: if I only knew your dark side before I prime subbed LUL

00:29:44
<transcript>: Interesting Greg, from Succession vibes. In the fourth image there. Fifth. I may have scrolled since then. Greg from succession.

00:30:01
f0ll0w: I can't cancel my prime sub because of u black facing right? Kappa

00:30:10
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't know. This was the thing. You can put a bunch of photos of yourself, and then it turns them into a bunch of memes. It struggles with the teeth. My teeth constantly look way too long or something. Oh, that's so creepy.

00:30:15
<transcript>: See that one looks like me. And like the meme.

00:30:19
<transcript>: Also, some of them were really bad.

00:30:19
<transcript>: i know when

00:30:25

00:35:22
pbertrand_dev: can we have a safe sentence? "I love trump"

00:35:25
<transcript>: In America doing blackface gets you erased. And Adam did it. Oh, boy, I did it. He's so caught off in the rest of society in the ozark. It's true. My issue with Data was that I needed to find all political candidates and get their political standpoint somehow. How did you do that? Good, grandpa rhubarb. Where'd that come from? True.

00:35:27
pbertrand_dev: Kappa

00:35:27
trivenge: how are you doing today, adam, you elixir loving, black face trolling man? im kidding, idk what we are talking about, i came in at the wrong time LUL

00:35:32
<transcript>: Rhubarb. Oh, that's our safe word. Okay, rhubarb. We'll see if that gets abused. I'm sure it will.

dmdboi: LUL

00:35:48
laytanl_: I feel like Dax saying it is the safe word

00:35:50
<transcript>: I'm confused. He didn't do lifetime. Yeah, russ, there's just Messling me. Welcome to Chat, by the way, rust. You'll notice that certain people in my chat like dax Thdxr just troll me the entire time I stream. And you can't take anything they say too seriously. I know they mean. Well, it's how they show affection. Probably.

00:35:50
<transcript>: motion for

00:35:51
rustlinuxsubaru: i see i see

00:35:55
<transcript>: Balinciaga. I can't even say it.

00:35:55
<transcript>: okay

00:35:57
<transcript>: Okay.

00:35:58
cosmiclasagna: trolling? what does that mean

00:36:01
dmdboi: Can safe word be the safe word

00:36:08
<transcript>: Safe word. Larvar. I say that too much, though. Step. Rose here. Did you omg. What? What did I do? Can we have a safe sentence? No, I'm not saying that. Not saying it. You're going to cut it out of context.

00:36:08
<transcript>: how are you doing today

00:36:08
lesabotsy: Calling out scams is trolling now? Hi adam, hi all :)

00:36:11
thdxr: adam is gaslighting us

00:36:12
<transcript>: How are you doing today, Adam? You elixir, Loving, blackface trolley Man. Oh, my goodness.

00:36:20
<transcript>: We're talking about came at the wrong time. There is no good time, triv. There is no right time it's all the wrong time on my stream.

00:36:25
<transcript>: Dm? Me? Yes. Please, go, grandpa. I feel like dax saying it is the safe word.

00:36:28
<transcript>: Trolling. What does that mean.

00:36:28
<transcript>: safer would be the safer

00:36:32
<transcript>: Safer would be the safer. Okay, let's get to work at this Castle.

00:36:32
<transcript>: oh my goodness

00:36:33
<transcript>: Oh, my goodness.

00:36:33
<transcript>: hey

00:36:36
<transcript>: Hey, lesa's, here.

00:36:41
<transcript>: So what I'm doing now is.

00:36:45
<transcript>: I'm writing the code for.

00:36:49
<transcript>: When you click this Delete Account button.

00:36:56
<transcript>: If you're a stripe paying customer, I've got to cancel your account and then I've got to delete all your data. It's like GDPR.

00:36:56
<transcript>: compliance

00:36:57
cosmiclasagna: hey did someone start counting how many times adam gets distracted this stream?

00:37:00
<transcript>: Compliance stuff like, I want to purge everything from your existence.

00:37:04
<transcript>: And I wanted to Google, actually.

00:37:07
<transcript>: Stripe.

00:37:14
<transcript>: Delete user Delete account api I don't know.

00:37:14
<transcript>: what

00:37:20
<transcript>: What's the way to do this? I want to make sure I do the right apis because I first need to cancel the subscription. I think.

00:37:20
<transcript>: that's connect

00:37:23
<transcript>: That's connect. I don't want connect.

00:37:26
<transcript>: Delete a customer.

00:37:30
<transcript>: Oh, also, immediately cancels any active subscriptions. Okay.

00:37:33
thdxr: i’m actually gonna start streaming soon

00:37:38
thdxr: working hard this week!

00:37:46
<transcript>: Okay, I should probably do that right. If they delete their account on status, they probably want to delete everything, including their account on stripe. Actually going to start streaming soon. Do it, dax. I hate it. Someone start counting. How many times Adam gets distracted. A stream. Oh, goodness.

00:37:46
<transcript>: yeah dax is

00:37:53
amazingdavi: Gonna work on replicache?

00:37:54
tnkhanh: when do I get my MacBook?

00:37:59
<transcript>: Yeah. Dax is working hard. You're working on the console. I love it. I want the console to exist. Is it? Hey, dax, is it basically going to be like versaille? I can just connect my github, and then everything just gets deployed automatically. And life is good.

00:38:06
lesabotsy: @cosmiclasagna don't bother, he just pretend to work, this is a Just chatting stream

00:38:07
<transcript>: Whoa, wow. Be thank you for the follow. When do you get your MacBook, T and K? When you win, you get a MacBook.

00:38:08
bishopdev: the fact that you can keep working while switching context all the time is amazing to me

00:38:09
<transcript>: I haven't seen anybody win yet.

00:38:09
<transcript>: and

00:38:13
<transcript>: And I'm sure if someone wins, you guys will let me know about it.

00:38:15
thdxr: yeah like vercel

00:38:21
<transcript>: I don't look too closely because I'm positive you guys are going to yell. Don't bother. He just pretend to work. This is a just chatting Street.

00:38:21
<transcript>: jack

00:38:22
thdxr: figuring out details though

00:38:32
<transcript>: Jack, you can keep working while switching contacts all the time is amazing. Have you watched Bishop? Do I actually get anything done when I'm streaming? Streaming is my fun time. This is the time that I get to enjoy in the morning.

00:38:34
rustlinuxsubaru: @BishopDev thats why i could never stream

00:38:39
<transcript>: While I kind of get stuff done mostly I don't get much done it's mostly after stream.

00:38:39
<transcript>: figuring out

00:38:49
cosmiclasagna: @Lesabotsy LUL

00:38:49
<transcript>: Figuring out details, though. Yes. Stacks, please. Also, dax, I had a question about yesterday. That's why I could never stream. Well, if you just do it for a couple of hours or something, you can limit the damage.

00:38:49
<transcript>: dax

00:38:50
trivenge: if sst becomes a billion dollar company, dax said he will buy me a ticket to florida so i can give the man a hug and a firm handshake, but we haven't worked out the contract on that one

00:38:51
amazingdavi: Nicee

00:38:56
<transcript>: Dax, you said yesterday. I think on your stream you're going to make the thing that vin's AWS accounts.

00:39:06
<transcript>: Are you actually doing it under one organization. You're going to create accounts that belong, but they're going to manage billing or something like not do consolidated billing. How are you doing that.

00:39:12
bishopdev: I'd either focus entirely on chat ( with my 1 viewer ) or forget about chat and just hyper focus on what I'm doing

00:39:15
<transcript>: If ssd becomes a billion dollar company, dax said he will buy me a ticket to Florida so I can give the man a hug. And a firm handshake had worked out the contract on that one.

00:39:22
<transcript>: I either focus entirely on chat with my one viewer, or forget about chat and just hyper focus on what I'm doing.

00:39:22
<transcript>: yeah no

00:39:27
mehulsharmamat: wait is dax making a vercel like company?

00:39:28
mehulsharmamat: lets go!

00:39:32
<transcript>: Yeah, no, it's very distracting. Streaming is not going to be your most productive time unless you're like Dead Mouse, and you just ignore Chat altogether. If you're that famous, you can you just ignore it.

00:39:37
trivenge: true

00:39:40
<transcript>: Speaking of, if ssc becomes a billion dollar company, I legitimately. Not just because.

00:39:40
<transcript>: zax is a friend

00:39:44
trivenge: if you are famous you get to do what you want

00:39:45
trivenge: LUL

00:39:51
<transcript>: Zax is a friend. I think ssd is going places. I just think it's such a good option for every startup. And I think there's going to be so many actual customers of sst because.

00:39:54
dmdboi: Can we all invest in sst?

00:39:58
<transcript>: It's good for companies who are real and not just like side projects or indie hackers.

00:40:04
<transcript>: I'm so bullish on sst. And I've thought about this a lot. How can I benefit.

00:40:04
<transcript>: when ss

00:40:06
<transcript>: When ssd takes off.

00:40:06
<transcript>: how do

00:40:11
<transcript>: How do I make like, how do I place my bet? It was a public company.

00:40:11
<transcript>: i invest in

00:40:14
rvnn: Azure can use something like SST

00:40:20
tnkhanh: what is sst?

00:40:21
dmdboi: "how do I make money when sst takes off"

00:40:24
<transcript>: I invest in their stock with ssd. I can't do that. So then I thought, should I just make a bunch of content about sst and become the sst guy? And then I just rise with the tide.

00:40:24
<transcript>: i don't know

00:40:34
<transcript>: I don't know. I got to figure it out. How do I make money when ssc takes off? That's right. That's the question. Can we all invest in ssd? Yeah. What are our options here? Dax, can you do.

00:40:36
<transcript>: A little.

00:40:36
mehulsharmamat: become the SST guy

00:40:38
trivenge: oooo new idea, if sst goes public, adam stops giving away macbooks and instead, sst stock options LUL

00:40:42
<transcript>: What are they called on angel list when you can do.

00:40:42
<transcript>: like a group of people

00:40:46
schrew: We are investing in SST by being Dax's "friends"

00:40:47
tnkhanh: Sales and Service Tax (SST)

00:40:49
<transcript>: Like a group of people, all invest under one item on the cap table. What are those called? I forgot.

00:40:51
mehulsharmamat: also sst in my country = social sciences. I can't un-see htat.

00:40:52
laytanl_: Give me the money and ill make sure it gets to the sst guys

00:40:53
bodhihawken: Waiting for a couple things in SST before I move over all the startups I work with! So pumped!

00:40:53
<transcript>: Not a consortium. No. What I called.

00:40:53
<transcript>: prin

00:40:56
<transcript>: Prince of devil Singer to follow rust linux thank you for the follow.

00:40:59
goodgrandpaa: @triveNge Por que no los dos?!

00:41:00
<transcript>: There's a name for that.

00:41:00
rvnn: like republic.co

00:41:03
<transcript>: Sales and Service tax.

00:41:09
<transcript>: Azure can use something like SSC.

00:41:12
sockthedev: conglomerate

00:41:13
<transcript>: If you're famous you get to do what you want also true.

00:41:13
<transcript>: wait

00:41:18
<transcript>: Wait. This dax Finger versus Light Company. He is. He already did.

00:41:18
<transcript>: they're just making a product

00:41:21
llcoolchris_: How many MILLIONS of users?!

00:41:21
<transcript>: They're just making a product that's more versailles, like.

00:41:29
<transcript>: Oh new idea of SSC goes public Adam stops giving away MacBooks and said SSC stock options.

00:41:29
trivenge: but not the two? my spanish is poor

00:41:35
trivenge: i havent taken spanish since 7th gradew

00:41:36
<transcript>: We are investing in ssd by being daxis friends. Yeah, but I don't think we benefit from that financially. I want to know. How do we benefit.

00:41:36
<transcript>: financially

00:41:36
trivenge: LUL

00:41:37
<transcript>: Financially.

00:41:44
<transcript>: Can't see social Sciences, give me the money and I'll make sure it gets to the ssc. Guys.

00:41:52
<transcript>: Bodie waiting for a couple of things in SC before I move over all the startups I work with, so pumped. Yeah, it's really good for startups.

00:41:52
<transcript>: how many

00:41:58
<transcript>: How many millions of users? Cool. Chris is here. What's going on? Chris.

00:42:05
<transcript>: We've got it's in the low millions. It's a few million users on sammys.com.

00:42:05
<transcript>: but

00:42:07
<transcript>: But it's in the millions.

stroopwafel26: when sst is a billion dollar company, zuko cam becomes free

00:42:10
<transcript>: Not the two. My Spanish is poor.

00:42:10
<transcript>: who's

00:42:22
<transcript>: Who's saying Spanish? I haven't taken Spanish in 7th grade. When ssc is a billion dollar company, zuko Cam becomes free. Oh, there we, there we go. Dax given back to the people. Dax has now left my chat. I'm feeling very.

00:42:22
<transcript>: just left

00:42:23
<transcript>: Just left.

00:42:23
<transcript>: feeling

00:42:27
<transcript>: Feeling very betrayed. He's gone now. He hasn't answered any of my questions.

00:42:34
<transcript>: Which is a bummer. Okay.

00:42:37
<transcript>: So if I want to delete a customer.

00:42:37
<transcript>: this

00:42:37
goodgrandpaa: @triveNge "Why not the two" essentially. Usually used as "why not both?" though.

00:42:49
<transcript>: This is probably what I want to do. Just permanently delete the customer can't be undone. Also, immediately cancels any active subscriptions on the customer. So what I need to do is just pass the customer ID and we just do this operation if there is a customer ID.

00:42:49
<transcript>: wipe the

laytanl_: I want SST for other languages

00:42:50
cosmiclasagna: when sst skyrockets -- dax gets modded again

00:42:52
<transcript>: Wipe the user just delete it.

00:42:54
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:42:54
<transcript>: what's the

00:43:02
mehulsharmamat: oh i accidentally went to dax's stream to check if he has YT and the stream time was literally 0:00:01 lol

00:43:03
sockthedev: remember when we used to watch adam write raw cdk

00:43:05
<transcript>: What's the api, though. Customers delete. Probably. Okay, so not any of this. This is so much more work. We can just get rid of all that we can say.

00:43:07
<transcript>: If body.

00:43:08
llcoolchris_: I'm doing great man, checking your stream before going to do actual work

00:43:09
<transcript>: Customer ID.

00:43:16
<transcript>: I really wish copilot wouldn't do that.

00:43:16
<transcript>: okay

00:43:17
<transcript>: Okay.

00:43:20
<transcript>: If body let's do this.

00:43:38
llebc: hey adam

00:43:40
<transcript>: We're getting to work now. People doing great, man. Check your stream before going to actual work. Well, enjoy actual work. Chris, I would love to catch another one of your streams. I'm not sure what time you stream, but you're one of those people. There's, like a few people in the dev streaming community that seem to have schedules that are completely opposite of mine. Like bash bunny. Maybe she doesn't stream much anymore.

00:43:40
<transcript>: but i've never

00:43:45
<transcript>: But I've never caught a live bash bunny stream. I don't think it's like she streams.

00:43:45
<transcript>: eight hours

00:43:48
<transcript>: 8 hours that I am either asleep or just not around.

00:43:52
<transcript>: Theo is the same way people who stream later.

00:43:52
<transcript>: i have

00:43:56
<transcript>: I have a weird schedule. I would love to catch one of your streams, though.

00:44:00
llcoolchris_: Lmao we're 100% opposite schedule, I'm in Canada, Toronto

00:44:01
<transcript>: Actually, I went to dax's stream to check if he has YouTube and the stream time was literally.

00:44:10
<transcript>: Oh, he just started streaming. That's why dax isn't here. That makes way more sense. I feel way better now. When SSC skyrock, skyrockets, dax gets modded again.

00:44:18
<transcript>: Remember when we used to watch Adam Wright Raw cdk like a madman.

00:44:18
<transcript>: one hundred percent

00:44:21
<transcript>: 100% Opposite Schedule. You're in Toronto.

00:44:24
<transcript>: Oh, interesting. Chris.

00:44:30
<transcript>: I'm in Central Time in North America, so, like your Eastern Time on Central Time, we're not that far off.

00:44:35
<transcript>: We stream very different schedules and work different schedules, I guess.

00:44:37
<transcript>: Okay.

00:44:37
<transcript>: let's see here

00:44:40
<transcript>: Let's see here. Hey, levic, how are you doing.

00:44:49
<transcript>: If this we're going to say await stripe customer. Oh, look at that delete. Just like that. No.

00:44:50
<transcript>: It's not delete.

00:44:52
<transcript>: That would be.

00:44:52
<transcript>: de

00:44:54
<transcript>: Dell.

00:44:54
<transcript>: it takes

00:45:02
<transcript>: It takes in a customer ID and params. I don't need any params. Probably. It's just that easy. Look at this. I'm going to put it on one line.

00:45:11
<transcript>: Do that if Body Customer ID delete the customer in stripe that will cancel their subscription. Everybody's happy.

00:45:11
<transcript>: now

00:45:14
<transcript>: Now we need to delete all the data.

00:45:14
<transcript>: all

00:45:15
llcoolchris_: LMAO man for some reason I thought you were like in New Zeeland because of your house

00:45:15
<transcript>: All the data.

00:45:15
<transcript>: in the

00:45:17
dmdboi: How do we watch both Adam and Dax at once

00:45:17
<transcript>: In the database.

00:45:19
mehulsharmamat: me and adam are literally 10.5 hours apart

00:45:21
<transcript>: We're going to return. What.

00:45:21
<transcript>: nothing

00:45:24
<transcript>: Nothing. We're not going to return anything. Okay.

00:45:24
<transcript>: time

00:45:26
<transcript>: Time to do.

00:45:26
<transcript>: delete

00:45:29
<transcript>: Delete. Yeah. Exactly. How did it know.

00:45:29
<transcript>: how did it know

00:45:31
<transcript>: How did it know.

00:45:31
<transcript>: that was

00:45:34
<transcript>: That was crazy. It's like it's listening to my mic or something.

00:45:36
llcoolchris_: Not Dax being a hater and doing a counter stream

00:45:38
<transcript>: For some reason, I thought you were like in New Zealand.

00:45:44
llebc: I'm good thanks man! How're you?

00:45:58
<transcript>: That's funny. No, I'm in America. I'm in the ozarks, which is in the middle of America. How do we watch both Adam and dax at once? Diamond, you can have two tabs open. I've done it. Sometimes I have three, four streamers open, but I turn the audio down on most of them. And I just have one of them, primarily.

00:46:01
<transcript>: Not saying which you should do that with.

00:46:03
4ohfournotfound: Dax streaming?

00:46:05
<transcript>: Not saying you should have me up. Primarily. I wouldn't say that.

00:46:08
<transcript>: But I'll let you make the right decision.

00:46:09
4ohfournotfound: there he is

00:46:17
<transcript>: And then I keep the others really low in case they say something interesting, and I want to pop in and listen to that one. But yeah, I watch multiple streams at once.

00:46:17
<transcript>: me

00:46:19
4ohfournotfound: "keep the right decision"

00:46:25
dmdboi: I'll ask both of you who I should mute and go from there

00:46:28
<transcript>: Me and Adam are literally ten and a half hours apart. Wow, mayhew, that is nuts. We are on opposite ends of the globe, not dax being a hater and doing a counter stream.

00:46:28
<transcript>: it's funny

00:46:31
<transcript>: It's funny. I'm good, levik. I'm really good, actually.

00:46:43
<transcript>: I've said it a few times the last couple of weeks. I can't imagine life being better. And that sounds like I'm aware that that's atypical and I'm also aware it's probably fleeting.

00:46:43
<transcript>: i don't think

00:46:58
<transcript>: I don't think life can be this good for the rest of my life. It's a season, but I do think I'm in one of those seasons where it's going to be tough to beat it's going to be tough to beat this season of life it's peak and we're just trying to savor it. Our boys are only going to be little in this size for so long.

00:47:03
<transcript>: Yeah, I just got an invite to Blue Sky. I mean, life is good.

00:47:06
<transcript>: That was a joke. That's not like a major.

00:47:06
<transcript>: reason

00:47:06
treasonist: love it

00:47:09
<transcript>: Reason that my life is good.

00:47:09
<transcript>: dax

00:47:11
<transcript>: Dax Stream. There he is. Keep the right decision.

00:47:15
mehulsharmamat: alright im gonna hit the gym now. cya

00:47:16
<transcript>: I'll ask both of you who I should mute and go from there. That sounds good, diamond. That's a good idea.

00:47:18
cosmiclasagna: weird flex

00:47:24
rvnn: I'm having FOMO with BlueSky

00:47:27
<transcript>: All right. Mayhol get a good pump in it's. Okay. If you're just going to watch dax, you don't have to lie to me. I'm just kidding.

00:47:27
<transcript>: weird

00:47:31
<transcript>: Weird flex having FOMO, don't have FOMO.

<transcript>: And you're not missing anything. Honestly, it's a little wholesome for me. It's a little too. Like, isn't this so great? There's just a few of us that are all so kind. That's like every other message is like, everyone's just so kind here. Yeah.

00:47:47
<transcript>: when there's like

00:47:51
rvnn: that doesn't help lol

00:47:52
<transcript>: When there's like zero 1% of the number of people, then there's a lot less.

00:47:52
<transcript>: unkind

00:48:02
<transcript>: Unkindness. But that'll change. Eventually it'll be as big as Twitter. If it's going to take off and then it'll be just like Twitter. It's literally just like Twitter without the people right now.

00:48:02
<transcript>: so

00:48:08
<transcript>: So nothing to be FOMOD about. That doesn't help. Oh, no. Did I make it more fun.

00:48:08
<transcript>: i'm like

00:48:11
lesabotsy: kind people attracts other kind people :)

00:48:13
<transcript>: I'm like, is this this tiny, elite club? And we're all having a great time. There's nothing to be FOMO about.

00:48:15
laytanl_: Yeah fr I actually tweeted about that

00:48:17
<transcript>: Kind people attracts other kind people.

00:48:17
<transcript>: yeah

00:48:20
llcoolchris_: They got me buying another domain name just to flex

00:48:21
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't know when you think about the invite system.

00:48:21
<transcript>: you only invite

00:48:33
laytanl_: Trolls/bad actors aren't in there yet so it's currently better

00:48:34
nartc: Does it allow tweeting highlighted code block?

00:48:37
<transcript>: You only invite people you really like. And I think there's a lot of people on Twitter that reply hatefully to everything that gets tweeted and probably not a lot of people like them. So they're maybe going to be the last to get an invite. So it does make sense with the invite system. That generally speaking.

00:48:38
laytanl_: But that's not lasting

00:48:45
<transcript>: People who aren't complete jerks will be invited first, because if you're a complete jerk, then who's giving you an invite.

00:48:48
<transcript>: I don't know.

00:48:49
trivenge: i feel like twitter will still dominate over bluesky

00:48:49
bishopdev: there's also people who don't really post a lot on twitter

00:48:52
<transcript>: They got me buying another domain.

00:49:10
bishopdev: but use it to keep up 2 date with tech stuff by following some weird streamers

00:49:12
<transcript>: Yeah. Oh, I love that about Blue Sky. Everything else is like whatever. It's Twitter. And I can't post videos there, so I'm a little bummed, but the domain thing is so great. I have so many domains I love, and now I can just flex with them on Blue Sky. It's the best trolls. Bad actors aren't in there yet, so it's currently better. Does it allow tweeting highlighted code block? Not yet.

00:49:18
<transcript>: Narcd narcd nart? I struggle with lots of consonant sounds together.

00:49:22
<transcript>: It does not allow code blocks yet.

00:49:22
<transcript>: somebody

00:49:25
dmdboi: I wonder if I can use an emoji domain

00:49:27
<transcript>: Somebody just said that. Who said that on blue sky. They said if there's code blocks, it's over.

00:49:27
<transcript>: i feel like

00:49:29
<transcript>: I feel like Twitter.

00:49:29
<transcript>: will still dominate

<transcript>: just di

00:49:38
<transcript>: Just dies completely.

00:49:38
<transcript>: just fiz

00:49:45
<transcript>: Just fizzles out and everybody loses interest. Or if it takes off and becomes huge, neither one would surprise me. I could see either outcome.

00:49:52
<transcript>: I do think it's a lot better than masterdon. It's not hard to get logged in.

00:49:52
<transcript>: there's

00:49:55
<transcript>: There's none of the big barriers that mastodon had.

00:49:55
<transcript>: i feel like twitter

00:50:04
llcoolchris_: Man I hate Mastodon

00:50:04
<transcript>: I feel like Twitter will still dominate. There's also people who don't really post a lot on Twitter, but use it to keep up to date with text stuff by following some weird streamers. Wait.

00:50:04
trivenge: mastodon WutFace

00:50:07
<transcript>: Bishop was that a backhanded comment.

00:50:13
<transcript>: When you say weird streamers, you're talking about like dax, and people like that, right.

00:50:21
<transcript>: I wonder if I can use an emoji domain. Oh, good question, diamond. I still wish I could write a post and markdown.

00:50:36
<transcript>: I've got a lot of dms to read, and that's not like I'm special. It's just I literally never read them. And I've said it before on stream it's because.

00:50:49
<transcript>: If I read it and I think it's something I need to respond to immediately. I don't want to read it because I don't want to Mark it unread and then forget. So I just never open it, which is a problem. Thank you so much for the follow.

<transcript>: So the app I'm working on stammies.com is currently an elixir app. We are porting it over to astro, which is typescript.

00:52:32
<transcript>: And so right now, I'm working on the elixir part, but I'm also working on some of the typescript part. I'm back and forth. That's why you're not seeing only Elixir. Okay, I got to get back to work. All that login and page sub thing was just enough to kill my interest in mask on. Yeah, it had no chance. Right.

00:52:35
rvnn: lol everyone is now trying

<transcript>: Next up, we're going to Delete account. So here we go.

00:52:53

00:52:57
<transcript>: This to user delete.

00:52:57
<transcript>: return

00:52:59
ghostyx101: adamdevKappa

<transcript>: But where is the lead account called? I don't Remember. There we go. Delete account. Yeah, perfect.

00:53:49
<transcript>: Here we go. This is what Delete Account hits. Yeah.

00:53:49
<transcript>: return

00:53:51
<transcript>: Return URL not a thing.

00:53:52
unrulyhotfixer: I am lurking in your stream. on one screen and lurking in dax watching you in another screen

00:53:59
<transcript>: Well, I guess it kind of is a thing. So here it is. Stripe customer says this is not how it works. What we're going to do is we're going to say.

00:54:04
<transcript>: Oh, man, none of this is right. I haven't wired all this up.

00:54:06
<transcript>: It's going to be stripe.

00:54:06

<transcript>: Con return URL.

00:54:19
<transcript>: But I need to pass? Wait.

00:54:23
<transcript>: That's not what it takes. It takes any user.

00:54:23
<transcript>: so

00:54:25
<transcript>: So let's just get the user user.

00:54:29
<transcript>: Equals.

00:54:29
rollie042: so 1000 points has a real value of $0.20

00:54:37
<transcript>: And we pass in.

00:54:37
<transcript>: user

00:54:39
<transcript>: User.

00:54:39
<transcript>: but then

00:54:40
<transcript>: But then what does this do.

00:54:40
<transcript>: use

00:54:44
<transcript>: Use Ready and user stripe customer ID. Okay.

00:54:47
<transcript>: That all. Sounds good.

00:54:47
<transcript>: so

00:54:50
<transcript>: So we just do stripe delete account and then.

00:54:50
<transcript>: json

00:54:51
<transcript>: Json.

00:54:52
darrenbaldwin03: @rollie042 The chance to get a macbook is 0.000000001 percent

00:55:26
<transcript>: So 1000 points has a real value of zero.

00:55:29
rvnn: err, what's the business model of stat muse? there's no paid subs, just the store?

00:55:35
<transcript>: 220 cents. Does it haso one in 10,000. That's right, Ben. What is the chance? Yes. Ghosty. Ghost is here.

00:55:42

<transcript>: What is this? This is an api controller. So this is.

00:56:27

00:56:30
<transcript>: User.

00:56:33
<transcript>: Post user delete. What did I say.

00:56:40
<transcript>: Delete account no.

00:56:57
<transcript>: I don't know.

00:56:57
<transcript>: could have done

00:56:59
<transcript>: Could have done like actual.

00:56:59
<transcript>: i could have

00:57:09
<transcript>: I could have done actual rest semantics and made it a delete verb and named it better. But again, it's a dead code base. Nobody cares.

00:57:13
<transcript>: Like we are literally repra.

00:57:14
<transcript>: repraping this

00:57:17
<transcript>: Repraping this Delete account. Okay.

00:57:22
<transcript>: So what do we do? We say off get current user.

00:57:22
<transcript>: i guess

00:57:23
nexxeln: hewwo

00:57:29
<transcript>: I guess I need to match I guess I do need to match on if there's no user, we shouldn't do any of this, right.

00:57:34
<transcript>: Okay so auth get current user.

00:57:37
<transcript>: It's just going to be user.

00:57:37
<transcript>: and then

00:57:39
<transcript>: And then nil.

00:57:39
<transcript>: there

00:57:42
<transcript>: There's no user. We can't do anything right.

00:57:50
<transcript>: User. Url. No. We're going to say.

00:58:02
<transcript>: Response equals stripe. Delete customer. Okay, so we delete the customer that's going to delete the database and all that stuff. Now we just need to delete the session sessions.

00:58:06
<transcript>: Let's see here.

00:58:07
<transcript>: Sessions.

00:58:17

00:59:44
<transcript>: I'm not going to do, like a piping thing. I could have maybe said, like Con, and then pipe it into one and pipe it into the other. No, we're just doing this.

00:59:50
<transcript>: Right. I would have to change this to taking a connection, and I don't want to do that.

00:59:54
<transcript>: Nix is here. What's going on next.

00:59:58
<transcript>: to

01:00:07

01:00:07
<transcript>: i've heard

01:00:12
nexxeln: haha

01:00:16
<transcript>: I've heard some people poke fun at the no semicolons thing and made me feel a little like, Am I out there on some limb? But no, it looks better. It's aesthetically pleasing. Okay.

01:00:24
nexxeln: i don't care what people think

01:00:40
<transcript>: so

01:00:49
<transcript>: So Next is not bad, but stat muse is very uninteractive. It's like wikipedia. Would you build wikipedia with astro or with next.

01:00:58
daglee: All amazon passwords and tokens*

01:01:02
<transcript>: Personally, I would build it with astro. Although I know the next and the react people. I can hear them right now. In my head, we were going to navigate a bunch. You're going to wish you had those smooth transitions. No, I'm not okay. No, I'm not.

01:01:02

<transcript>: But that is to be fair. Thank you so much, arch mage for the follow. To be fair. That is the criticism. I heard prime make fun of the semicolon thing like you're gaining so much speed by not typing that one character.

01:01:42
<transcript>: I thought it was funny. The way he said it was very funny.

01:01:42
<transcript>: typescript

01:01:47
<transcript>: Typescript javascript without semicolon. It's like watching half naked old people. What.

01:01:47
<transcript>: i need you to

01:01:55
bishopdev: something is just missing ..

01:01:56
<transcript>: I need you to connect those dots for me. Bishop, I can't get there. Same. I'm rebuilding an Astro site with Astro again. Exactly. No. Next Astral all the way.

01:02:03
<transcript>: Oh, something is just missing I got you.

01:02:06
<transcript>: Hey.

01:02:06
<transcript>: so

01:02:12
<transcript>: So do we want to make delete customer taking a connection? I don't know. I'm starting to wonder if I should.

01:02:32
<transcript>: This is such a terribly named file at this point does things that are not stripe related. Should we pass in a connection? Let's see here. We just pass any user. There's a user. Yeah. I think this shouldn't take into connection. I think it should just take in the user and just do the deleting. Just delete the thing.

01:02:35
<transcript>: Okay. I'm settled on that.

01:02:35
<transcript>: so we

01:02:40
<transcript>: So we delete the customer. I don't think there's anything I need from this.

01:02:40
<transcript>: oops

01:02:44
<transcript>: Oops wrong way we just delete it and then.

01:02:47
<transcript>: We log out.

01:02:50
daglee: Dunno. 2 major security personal recommended it but wasn't allowed to say why. Just that amazon was doing something bad. Dunno if it effect AWS.

01:02:52
<transcript>: Delete the customer log out how do I wait on this.

01:02:52
<transcript>: i guess

01:02:55
<transcript>: I guess it already is synchronous, right.

01:03:08
<transcript>: Two major security personal recommended, but wasn't allowed to say why? Just that Amazon was doing something bad, didn't know if it affects aws. Oh, jeez. Okay. Sounds bad.

01:03:16
<transcript>: This is synchronous. Right? Like when I delete this customer.

01:03:16
<transcript>: it's going to use

01:03:19
<transcript>: It's going to use http poison.

01:03:21
01_pollux: You guyts saw that too right?

01:03:23
<transcript>: And it's going to call this post.

01:03:27
<transcript>: And it's not going to do anything until it responds, right? It's all synchronous. Yeah.

01:03:27
<transcript>: synchronous

01:03:30
01_pollux: theos post

01:03:31
<transcript>: Synchronous log out and then just return.

01:03:34
<transcript>: No, we're just going to redirect.

01:03:34
<transcript>: we're going to

01:03:37
<transcript>: We're going to do redirect.

01:03:39
01_pollux: So funny

01:03:40
nexxeln: which post

01:03:41

01:05:28
nexxeln: sorry about that

01:05:46
<transcript>: It's a little out of date. I need to push my latest. What do you think of astro moving to a client side router? Yeah, it's interesting. Wower. I feel like here's the thing. If astro just became next, but not pretentious, I'm here for it. If asher wants to copy all of the all the stuff and just be next without having to use react.

01:07:10
<transcript>: Oh, the next pretentious stuff. Sorry.

01:07:10
<transcript>: it's not that

01:07:13
<transcript>: It's not that everyone at marcel is pretentious.

01:07:17
<transcript>: It's just that as a brand, they're pretentious pretentious.

01:07:17
<transcript>: and that

01:07:21
<transcript>: And that's just a fact. This is subjective. Truth.

01:07:30
01_pollux: are you working at vercel?

01:07:31
<transcript>: Okay. I don't mean that in a negative way. I mean, that's what they're going for. They're going for, like, the Apple elitist branding. And it's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

nexxeln: was it not obvious LUL

01:07:48
<transcript>: Did you get that impression that I was working at rosal? Based on the way I talk about herself, I really should lay off herself. I don't want to come off as a blind hater. I don't hate rosel. I use it. I love it. It's great.

01:07:57
<transcript>: Yakao face. I believe dax is streaming alongside me. We just both got a lot of work to do.

01:08:05
<transcript>: Both got a lot to do. Can't be hanging out in each other's streams. We're just going to stream same time. Delete coaster. What's wrong here.

01:08:08
<transcript>: Let's go back to stripe, delete.

01:08:08
<transcript>: customer

01:08:11
<transcript>: Customer. Here we go. Oh, Delete account.

01:08:11
<transcript>: it's delet

01:08:13
<transcript>: It's delete account.

01:08:14
rollie042: Blind hater? It's such a great source of corporate drama!

01:08:18
<transcript>: Delete account easy. Okay.

01:08:23
xproof_: what token would you use for email verification?

01:08:24
<transcript>: There's no user. You can't delete the account right if there is a user.

01:08:27
<transcript>: If there is a user.

01:08:31
01_pollux: Im not trying to bad mouth vercel here but once Remix cam out and Fly.io i have moved away from vercel long time ago

01:08:40
01_pollux: can recommend these two things enough

01:08:41
<transcript>: Then we delete the account, we log them out and we redirect to return url. All this looks good. I think all of the elixir side is prepared.

01:08:43
01_pollux: cant*

01:08:51
<transcript>: For me to implement that button. Now I got to go over here and actually delete the user. What token would you use for email verification? Welcome to Chat X proof.

01:08:51
<transcript>: what kind of token

01:08:52
rvnn: Do you soft delete the user?

01:08:54
<transcript>: What kind of token you mean, like, how would you generate the token.

01:08:57
<transcript>: How would I generate the token? I'll tell you how we do it.

01:09:02
<transcript>: Let's see, how can I find this? Verify.

01:09:06
<transcript>: No.

01:09:12
<transcript>: Sneeze it's going to be so loud I'm so sorry scream so loud.

01:09:16

01:09:39
cosmiclasagna: how bout railway what are everyone's thoughts

01:09:41
<transcript>: Blind hater it's such a great source of corporate drama. It really is. I'm not trying to badmouth for so here but once remix came out and fly I O I have moved away from Brussels a long time ago. Can recommend these two things though. I've heard a lot of people like fly.

01:09:48
<transcript>: Oh, can't recommend these two things. Enough is what you said. Do you soft delete the user? No.

01:10:00
<transcript>: Ravin, we're just going to straight delete them. We're going to cut them out of the database because this is also how we're going to fulfill gdpr requirements. So when someone wants to delete their account, we are going to wipe it clean.

01:10:00
<transcript>: that's how we're

01:10:02
<transcript>: That's how we're doing, it.

01:10:09
<transcript>: I'm trying to implement email verification, but the only thing I can think of is using a uuid. So let me find where we do it. Here.

01:10:09
<transcript>: email

01:10:11
<transcript>: Email.

01:10:14
<transcript>: All.

01:10:16
<transcript>: Where is that.

01:10:20
<transcript>: Cost Controller. Here we go. Confirm email.

01:10:25
<transcript>: Let's see. Confirm email, confirm token.

01:10:25
<transcript>: okay

01:10:26
<transcript>: Okay.

01:10:30
<transcript>: Let's look in the style for token.

01:10:32
<transcript>: User invalidate token.

01:10:36
<transcript>: See where we generate the token.

01:10:38
01_pollux: @cosmiclasagna Railway is cumbersome, i was not able to deply my monorepo project on it

01:10:39
<transcript>: Sign in by token. Validate token.

01:10:48
<transcript>: It might be in here.

01:10:52
<transcript>: Sign in by token. Let's go. Here.

01:10:54
01_pollux: that was my experience

01:11:00
<transcript>: Send email here we go new sign in token chain set here we go, here we go.

01:11:04
<transcript>: Finding it. We're finding it.

01:11:04
<transcript>: change

01:11:11
cosmiclasagna: yeah I heard people ran into problems using monorepos in railway

01:11:15
<transcript>: Change validate required put change sign in token. New sign in token. I did it. I found it. I found new sign in token. Util's. Random hash.

01:11:15
<transcript>: six

01:11:18
<transcript>: 16? Oops oh no.

01:11:21
<transcript>: Where was it? No.

01:11:22
c9_fuzz: he found it

01:11:24
<transcript>: There it is. Okay.

01:11:24
xproof_: random hash :O poggers

01:11:25
<transcript>: So.

01:11:25
<transcript>: length

01:11:29
<transcript>: Length 16 digit.

01:11:36
<transcript>: It's using moth. It's random hash. Wait, what? Let's look what this is. Crypto. Strong. Rand bites.

01:11:41
<transcript>: In base 64 encoded. And that's it.

01:11:49
<transcript>: Strong Ram bites. No, I would not. That's just like base library stuff. So there you go. Random hash.

01:11:56
<transcript>: There's your answer. That's how we do it. In stat, muse. I don't know if that's good. It's been a long time since we did it.

01:12:04
<transcript>: Let's see. Welcome to Chat. Cloud 200. How long have you been using elixir? So we wrote this code base. The electric code base.

01:12:05
<transcript>: Is.

01:12:08
<transcript>: Seven years old.

01:12:08
<transcript>: that's

01:12:10
<transcript>: That's crazy.

01:12:10
<transcript>: that's nuts

01:12:13
<transcript>: That's nuts. It's seven years old.

01:12:13
<transcript>: i've

01:12:24
xproof_: are you generating random bits, base64 encoding it and get a substring?

01:12:32
<transcript>: I've worked in this code base off and on for those seven years, it's never been my primary focus, so I'm not a great Elixir dev. I can get around kind of figure out what I'm doing with the help of twitch, Chat and chat gbt, I feel like I can pretty well make any changes I need to make, but not really my strong suit. I don't spend a ton of time in elixir.

01:12:49
<transcript>: How about railway? What are the everyone's thoughts? Railway is supposed to be good too, right? I've heard no cover some. I was able to deploy my Ron Republic not able to bullet. Oh yeah. Mono repos are a whole thing. I heard people ran into problems using monor reapers around. Wait, there you go. Ssd. Highly recommended.

01:12:49
<transcript>: works with

01:12:59
<transcript>: Works with mono repos. In fact it's an opinionated like if you start a new project with ssd, it gives you a mono repo and it does everything for you, which is great because typescript monorapas are not always the best.

01:13:01
<transcript>: Okay.

01:13:07
<transcript>: Are you generating random bits? Basically, if we're encoding it and getting a substring that's exactly right. X proof. That's exactly right.

01:13:17
wouterdb_: I got my turborepo deployed on railway but it was a bit of a hassle

01:13:17
<transcript>: Excellent distillation of what we're doing, okay, it's time to delete the user from the database.

01:13:23
<transcript>: Oh, no. Oh, no. Okay. Here's what we're going to do. Await DB.

01:13:28
<transcript>: Collection? What is this? How it works? Collection.

01:13:32
<transcript>: Let's just do this. Let's go up here to DB.

01:13:32
<transcript>: and

01:13:33
<transcript>: And.

01:13:36
jam5991: nice camera angle

01:13:41
<transcript>: I'm going to need to so we've got user ID. You have the user table. I'm going to need another table. I think for the follow. Pollocks.

01:13:45
<transcript>: Nice camera. Well, thank you, Jam. Welcome to chat.

01:13:50
aj_stuyvenberg: Good morning friends HeyGuys

01:13:53
01_pollux: dude what engergy bar is that?

01:13:59
<transcript>: I got my turbo repo deployed on railway, but it was a bit of a hassle. I've used turbo repo. I've even contributed to turbo repo. Believe it or not, I have done some open source work. Json. Parse. Okay, so we're going to add another table.

01:14:01
<transcript>: So user table.

01:14:02
01_pollux: energy*

01:14:04
<transcript>: We're going to add.

01:14:07
<transcript>: A.

01:14:07
<transcript>: user

01:14:10
<transcript>: User asks table or something what do.

01:14:15
<transcript>: We.

01:14:24
<transcript>: Just cascade right. If I just delete the user, I don't guess it would just straight up delete everything with it.

01:14:29
<transcript>: Oh, man. I just realized there's going to be a lot of tables I have to look at now.

01:14:29
<transcript>: view

01:14:32
<transcript>: View here's. Contacts. I bet.

01:14:32
<transcript>: these

01:14:39
<transcript>: These no user ID. Every table that has a user ID. I guess I'm going to have to.

01:14:44
c9_fuzz: deep goes the rabbithole

01:14:46
<transcript>: Delete the user ID from all these tables.

01:14:49
cosmiclasagna: SST is production-ready right? Thinking of using it for one of my upcoming clients.

rollie042: Do you allow messaging between users in some form?  Would you want to delete such messages from a deleted user?

01:15:20
<transcript>: How can the music died.

01:15:26
<transcript>: Oh, it really did stop? Did I hit a button? Maybe I hit a button.

01:15:26
<transcript>: okay

01:15:50
<transcript>: Users, visitors? Okay.

01:18:02

01:18:40
<transcript>: I don't actually know what the band name stands for, but it's band. I don't know if it stands for anything. I think they're one of those bands that's just like there's a lot of randomness involved.

01:18:40

rollie042: Your stream setup with transitions, periodic alternate camera angles, etc is really good btw :D

01:21:10
gitpush_gitpaid: feel like this is a test between the both of them to see where viewers would gravitate towards. they're a/b testing us.

01:23:44
<transcript>: I don't read twitch chat while I'm ping. I do read Twitter.

01:23:46

01:30:35
<transcript>: This failed to decode.

01:30:39

<transcript>: Not end. Okay.

01:31:16
<transcript>: I don't understand.

01:31:17
gitpush_gitpaid: @techsavvytravvy you mean great if you exclude all the assholes commenting on it

01:31:24
<transcript>: I haven't actually put it into the API yet. Oops.

01:31:26
<transcript>: This is the problem.

01:31:37
<transcript>: I haven't actually done this so stripe or it's going to be user delete.

01:31:42
<transcript>: Authorize your simple function.

01:31:45
<transcript>: User.

01:31:45
<transcript>: delet

01:31:49
<transcript>: Delete. Handler. Is that what I have? It.

01:31:53
techsavvytravvy: @gitpush_gitpaid some people just don't "get it" y'know??

01:31:57
<transcript>: User delete. Yeah. Okay. So that's why it's not found because I didn't actually wire it up. We got to do this again.

01:32:00
<transcript>: User.

01:32:02
<transcript>: Delete.

01:32:02
<transcript>: wait

<transcript>: Rat not found. Good call rally. That's exactly what it was. Crab Leg is great. Post an install script today. Nice.

01:32:34
techsavvytravvy: the crab feeds on their hate. it needs it.

01:32:44
<transcript>: I don't know if I set up my sitemap correctly because my phone and my desktop are showing two different last crawl. None of this makes sense. Sitemats are definitely one of those things that I always get annoyed that I have to think about and learn.

01:32:44
<transcript>: okay

01:32:47
<transcript>: Okay, kemp, run, Dev.

01:32:54
<transcript>: Is there an easy resource to actually learn? Vim? Leb it's not easy.

01:32:54
<transcript>: but

01:32:59
<transcript>: But it is a good resource that is Twitch Chat, SSO session. What.

01:33:00
grasp5533: Hey Adam, what frontend client would you use for Appsync? The amplify one?

01:33:06

01:33:09
<transcript>: Yeah. Here we go.

01:33:09
<transcript>: sign out

01:33:10
<transcript>: Sign out.

01:33:17
<transcript>: Twitchat was instrumental in me learning them.

01:33:21
gitpush_gitpaid: @techsavvytravvy it really does lol

01:33:25
<transcript>: It's not obviously very easy because you got to have people watching you. But if you just put, like, actually, if you just put.

01:33:28
<transcript>: In your title learning them.

01:33:28
<transcript>: or teach

01:33:30
<transcript>: Or teach me them.

01:33:30
<transcript>: it might work

01:33:31
<transcript>: It might work.

01:33:36
<transcript>: You might get some people to show up and teach you them cafes would show up. Maybe.

01:33:36
<transcript>: you mean

01:33:45
<transcript>: You mean great, if you exclude all the assholes commenting on it. What's that? Oh, crabbling. Some people just don't get it. The crab feeds on their hate. It needs it.

01:33:49

01:33:51
<transcript>: Hey, Adam, what fronting client would you use for app sync the amplify one, so grasp.

01:33:56
<transcript>: I never used the amplify. One I always used. What did I use.

01:34:02
<transcript>: I haven't done a lot of.

01:34:07
<transcript>: Absent graphql stuff in the last six months or so, but.

01:34:07
<transcript>: i think

01:34:10
<transcript>: I think I always use oh, I just use React, query.

01:34:20
<transcript>: You don't have subscription support with reactor if I recall that's the main gotcha but it's really nice for just making the request.

01:34:20
<transcript>: i think that's

techsavvytravvy: "teach me vim" tuesdays

01:34:24
<transcript>: I think that's what I use. Thank you so much for the Follow Alec.

01:34:24
<transcript>: and

01:34:28
aj_stuyvenberg: niceee

01:34:29
<transcript>: And did I see arcane cord? Thank you both. Thank you for those follows.

01:34:33
<transcript>: A teach me them tuesdays. There you go. Doing that today. Nice.

01:34:38
<transcript>: The thing. I like my thing about choosing.

01:34:38
<transcript>: librar

01:34:44
dontreadmynameoutloud1: I dont understand how anyone gets anything done on vim. The number of times I have fat fingered some key that nukes the whole buffer is too damn high

01:34:46
gitpush_gitpaid: i still dont understand why people use vim over vs code.

01:34:55
grasp5533: Thank you.  Would you still use GraphQL for the future or would you try the tRPC train?

01:34:58
<transcript>: Libraries and stuff is like, I want to choose the thing everybody uses. And like, the amplify client is not the thing that everybody uses. So I just want to fit into the web Dev community. Like, what's all the cool stuff we're using here? And then I fit aws into that. I don't say I'm using aws, so I'm going to fit all my choices into that. I go the other way. I say I'm a web Dev.

01:35:07
<transcript>: I'm going to use the normal web Dev stuff and I'm going to make AWS work for me. I'm going to use those nice serverless services.

01:35:10
<transcript>: But I'm going to do the hard work.

01:35:10
<transcript>: to kind of

01:35:27
<transcript>: To kind of use modern web Dev tools. I don't understand how anyone gets anything done on them. The number of times I have fat fingers, some key that nukes the whole buffer. Well, that's what U is for. You can always just undo, so don't understand why people use them over vs. Code. Honestly, git push turk. Here's the thing.

01:35:27
<transcript>: here's the

01:35:27
dontreadmynameoutloud1: might as well use arch linux along with vim and never get anything done and focus on yak shaving

01:35:29
<transcript>: Here's. The thing about them.

01:35:29
<transcript>: as we

01:35:33
<transcript>: As we wait on cloud formation. Perfect timing. Here's the thing.

01:35:33
<transcript>: vim

01:35:38
<transcript>: Vim. Motions. Actual learning vim, I think is worth it for anybody.

01:35:42
<transcript>: I think it's like legitimately, more efficient at editing.

01:35:42
<transcript>: a text

01:35:45
<transcript>: A text if you're just doing a lot of text editing.

01:35:49
<transcript>: Vim motions 100% help.

01:35:49
<transcript>: and

01:36:05
<transcript>: And I think they're a worthwhile pursuit people will say, oh, but my brain is a bottleneck. Yeah, well, sometimes you know what you need to write and you're just faster with vim motions? I'm still not the best I'm still getting a lot better hopefully getting better every day.

01:36:11
<transcript>: But Neil vim as opposed to vs. Code. That's just for funsies. In my opinion, some people.

01:36:11
<transcript>: they say it's

01:36:15
<transcript>: They say it's faster. It's lighter weight, all of those things.

dmmulroy: vim motions in vscode is a gateway drug

01:36:30
rollie042: Do you not have an entirely local development option? (i.e., no need to deploy to test client or api changes )

01:36:35
<transcript>: I think just vim motions and vs code is a perfectly fine solution. I know that's not maybe what a lot of neovan users would tell you, but to me, I use neo vim because it's fun and it's a nice hobby. I've enjoyed it at this season of my career, learning all the plugin just like figuring out how to tweak it and make it just like I want it that's.

01:36:35
<transcript>: been fun

01:36:44
<transcript>: Been fun, but the productivity gains if there are any are from actual vim motions which you can get in whatever IDE you're using right.

01:36:50
<transcript>: Thank you. Would you still use graphql for the future, or would you try the trpc train.

01:36:50
<transcript>: grass

01:36:51
<transcript>: Grass.

01:36:58
dmmulroy: I actually swapped from vscode to neovim b/c I worked in a large typescript repo for awhile and the input lag was noticable in vscode

01:36:58
<transcript>: None of my opinions have changed. I still think graphql is great. I still think App sync is great.

01:37:13
<transcript>: I'm curious why the music stopped. Also, trpc is great. I think they're all great. I think it's all case by case. I've happened to be in a hole for the last six months working on this status rewrite. And none of those things are top of mind for me.

01:37:13
<transcript>: just because

01:37:15
<transcript>: Just because I'm not making the.

01:37:15
<transcript>: decisions right now

01:37:21
<transcript>: Decisions. Right now, I'm working on an existing app. What client? Six quit with exit code Zero and signal Six. What is that about.

01:37:35
<transcript>: None of those things are top of mind for me right now, so it's hard like I don't have a lot of fresh opinions on it, but I don't think anything has changed my opinion. The growing popularity of trpc has not made me think like, oh, I never need to use graphql again.

01:37:35
<transcript>: just different

01:37:43
<transcript>: Just different tools for different jobs. Kind of depends on what you're working on. Might as well use arch linux along with them and never get anything done. And folks on Yak shaving.

01:37:43
<transcript>: don't read

01:37:47
<transcript>: Don't read my name out loud I love your name so much.

01:37:47
<transcript>: vim motions

01:37:47
gitpush_gitpaid: whats your opinion on bluesky? how is it there

01:37:57
<transcript>: Vim motions and vs. Code is a gateway drug. Exactly. You can always move into something like NEOVM later if you just want to keep going further and get red pilled harder. Do you not.

01:38:03

01:38:11
<transcript>: We got.

01:38:11
<transcript>: the fully

01:38:14
<transcript>: The fully local Dev environment.

01:38:14
<transcript>: a lot of people building

01:38:17
<transcript>: A lot of people building serverless apps modern cloud apps.

01:38:17
<transcript>: don't

01:38:19
<transcript>: Don't and.

01:38:19
<transcript>: they rely i guess

01:38:21
<transcript>: They rely, I guess. Sst.

01:38:36
<transcript>: The new stuff we're building with ssc that you're seeing here on screen. This stuff is cloud connected only here's the thing. I always have internet connectivity. I only work in my office. People say like, oh, but if I'm on a plane, how am I going to debug? Just take a break.

01:38:36
<transcript>: do we have to

01:38:52
sruchatek: What panes you have at the bottom? Aws? Elixir and what?

01:38:53
techsavvytravvy: Cheer1000

01:38:56
<transcript>: Do we have to work on a plane? Like, if you're on a plane, you have a long flight. Read a book, listen to something, sleep. There's a lot of fun things to do on a plane that are not. Pull up my laptop and try to be productive. So I hate that argument. That like, whoa, sometimes you don't have interconnectivity. Well, just like, okay, then don't work. When you don't have internet connectivity, I only work for my office. It doesn.

01:38:56
<transcript>: 't bother

01:39:03
<transcript>: 't bother me. It doesn't bother me that I only can work on a project because I'm connected to the cloud. That part doesn't bother me at all.

01:39:32
<transcript>: You know, turk, it's quiet. It's nice. I mean, it's it's like early days of Twitter. I imagine where there's just not that many people.

01:39:32
<transcript>: so

01:39:35
aj_stuyvenberg: Yeah I got my start on the serverless framework by hacking on serverless-offline. Almost 7 years later, now I'm a strong advocate for developing against the cloud.

01:39:43
<transcript>: So it's. But it's not like you should be super fomod. I love the domain thing, but like username is your domain. That's so great. Why not just use notepad? Well.

01:39:51
<transcript>: I mean, I guess notepad with vim bindings. You can make a case. I appreciate your input. I look to you for new technologies. I should keep up. Keep in mind. Yeah.

01:39:51
<transcript>: grass the industry

01:39:56
<transcript>: Grass. The industry has a good way of making you feel like you're missing out on stuff.

01:39:59
<transcript>: But most people aren't even.

01:39:59
<transcript>: using

01:40:06
<transcript>: Using React. React dominates in the very online community.

01:40:11
gitpush_gitpaid: "the industry".... tech twitter lol

01:40:11
<transcript>: But you take the whole broader 30 million developers what everybody's working on every day.

01:40:11
<transcript>: it's just such

01:40:13
aj_stuyvenberg: I ranted about it in a blog post somewhere.

01:40:17
<transcript>: It's just such a smorgasboard of old and new technologies and nothing.

01:40:17
<transcript>: is fundamentally chang

01:40:20
warrenbuffering: I use Windows 7

01:40:28
cloud200: are you giving away a Macbook?

01:40:29
<transcript>: Is fundamentally changing underneath your feet. You don't need to feel. I know. I feel that. That's why I'm saying this. Maybe I'm just speaking to myself, but it's easy to feel, like overwhelmed. Like I got to stay on top of all this stuff. No, you don't. You're fine. You can be productive in a lot of different technologies.

01:40:34
<transcript>: And then eventually you'll learn new stuff that you want to learn because you want to learn it.

01:40:41
<transcript>: Shrupkatech. Welcome to Chat. What pains do you have at the bottom? Aws, elixir. And what? This is the elixir.

laytanl_: I am looking into deploying a side project. I am trying to decide on data storage, you got rds, planet scale, railway etc. The app is primarily data driven (so big database) with a simple go server. Any recommendations? Serverless is so foreign to me

<transcript>: For funsies. The Bits for funsies. Thank you so much. Trav for the bits. I got my start on the serverless framework by hacking on serverless offline almost seven years later. Now I'm a strong advocate for developing against the cloud, the industry. Tech, Twitter. Yeah, exactly. Turk. When I said the industry, that's what I meant.

01:41:18

01:41:35
<transcript>: I use Windows Seven. There you go, Warren. Buffering. Stick it to the man. Nobody. You're not getting off your Windows Seven. Unless there's a good reason. Are you giving away a macbook? Yes, Cloud. I am. There's a .01% chance you can spend 1000 points on it twice a stream.

01:41:35
<transcript>: it's my little way

01:41:45
<transcript>: It's my little way of giving back. What do we think the most actually popular technology in the world is php? Great question offs a lot. I don't know. I wonder who knows.

01:41:50
rollie042: js, sadly

01:41:55
mecoupz: no macbooks, code behind it is bugged and doesn't work

01:42:00
aj_stuyvenberg: no macbooks _yet_

01:42:03
mecoupz: ask dax

01:42:05
<transcript>: Got rds planetscale, Railway et cetera. The app is primarily data driven so big database with simple go server any recommendation serverless is so foreign to me.

01:42:13
<transcript>: I'm out of all my drinks so my throat is just going to get dry. It's fine.

01:42:24
<transcript>: I mean, I love Planet scale. I've never used railway. I've heard good things about railway. I would not use rds just because I feel like you're going to spend a lot of time on stuff.

01:42:28
<transcript>: You don't need to worry about in 2023.

01:42:28
<transcript>: to use

01:42:38
<transcript>: To use rds, you immediately have to know what a vpc is, and you have to think about networking concepts that I just don't think people should be thinking about very often.

01:42:41
techsavvytravvy: so is that a flat 0.1% chance, or is there a finite number of redeems where your odds go up the more people try for it?

01:42:52
<transcript>: Status uses rds. It's fine technology and for people who need it and want to reach for it, it's great. I just think if you're starting a side project, I would start with Planet Scale. It's going to be portable in the sense that it's MySQL.

01:42:52
<transcript>: you can kind of move

01:42:53
gitpush_gitpaid: @laytanl_ i was recommended fly.io and railway but i stopped caring and just deployed on heroku because i know no ones going to use my shit

01:42:59
<transcript>: You can kind of move over to something else if you decided to rds or whatever for cost reasons or whatever reasons.

01:42:59
<transcript>: but i would

01:43:02
aj_stuyvenberg: @techsavvytravvy flat.

01:43:03
<transcript>: But I would start with Planet Scale. It's really great. That's my recommendation.

01:43:03
<transcript>: they make it really

01:43:11
aj_stuyvenberg: Adam built it on stream a while ago

01:43:15
<transcript>: They make it really easy too. The docs are good. Just getting started is easy. Can't work on a plane. I feel like I'm annoying everyone with all the typing. Yeah, exactly. I bring my mechanical keyboard, external monitor. It's got it all set up there.

01:43:15
<transcript>: in the

01:43:33
<transcript>: In the plane. No macbooks code behind it is bugged and doesn't work. It's not true. Me coops. No macbooks yet. So is that a flat 1% chance? Or is there a finite number of redeems where your odds go up, the more people try it. No, it's flat. It's zero 1% chance. So one in 10,000 trav.

01:43:44
<transcript>: I was recommended fly io in railway but I stopped carrying and just deployed on heroku because I know no one's going to use it. Well, that's not true, turk. Someone could use it. You got to go into it thinking somebody could use it.

01:43:44
ocelot2123: there better be some crazy animations on the screen when someone wins

01:43:46
laytanl_: Yeah going to look into planet scale, if i go with that i am also gonna look into serverless deployment of the go api

01:43:48
<transcript>: Have some face some belief in yourself.

01:44:07
laytanl_: Rds also very expensive looks like

01:44:09
<transcript>: Flat. Adam built it on Stream logo. That's right. There better be some crazy animation on the screen when someone wins. Actually awful lot. It's just a message in chat. I thought about that too. I was like, I should make like a huge celebration thing that blows up on my animation or on my overlays and makes a big deal. And it doesn't. Maybe I'll build it before someone wins. But right now it's just going to post.

01:44:09
<transcript>: a message

01:44:10
gitpush_gitpaid: would you use it? do you know anyone that would use it? exactly

01:44:10
<transcript>: A message and chat.

01:44:12
<transcript>: Okay.

01:44:18
<transcript>: Would you use it? Do you know anyone that would use it exactly? Well, turk, it's not exactly.

01:44:28
<transcript>: My alley, but that doesn't mean it's not up somebody's alley. I think people will use it. I think marketing is going to be your challenge, just like any startup.

01:44:28
<transcript>: it's all about

01:44:34
<transcript>: It's all about getting the word out. But if you figure out how to get the word out, I promise you, there are people who will use it.

01:44:36
<transcript>: I have no doubt.

01:44:36
<transcript>: okay

01:44:39
<transcript>: Okay. Delete my account. Let's see if it works.

01:44:39
<transcript>: inv

01:44:42
<transcript>: Invoked. Okay. Something failed.

01:44:51
<transcript>: What failed? Maybe it can't delete because of relationships or something. Update or delete on table users violate yeah, ask events user ID F key.

01:44:51
<transcript>: okay so

01:45:01
<transcript>: Okay, so we got to delete ask events first. This is good. This is helpful. This tells me what I thought was true, but I needed to hear it. I needed to be told.

01:45:06
<transcript>: For sure. So delete user. We're going to first delete.

01:45:13

01:45:52

I'm not sure Leighton I've never done migrations on planet scale. I've only built a couple of apps that I haven't had to do any migrations on.

01:46:52

ocelot2123: @mecoupz 1 adam buck worth roughly $0.00012 so you got 1.32 dollars LUL

01:51:24
<transcript>: Then down here.

01:51:31
<transcript>: Let's yank that word. Let's go back here.

01:51:38
<transcript>: it's

01:51:46
<transcript>: to

01:51:56
<transcript>: To lose a little bit of its lester Me coops, one Adam buck worth roughly zero point twelve. So you got $1.32.

01:51:56
<transcript>: when you look

01:51:58
<transcript>: When you look at it like that.

01:52:02
<transcript>: It's a little depressing, isn't it.

01:52:06
<transcript>: Okay.

01:52:07
gitpush_gitpaid: @mecoupz but how much is 1 adam buck to a stanley nickle

01:52:08
mecoupz: maths :D

01:52:09
<transcript>: So.

01:52:13
<transcript>: Do we think this is going to work now.

01:52:13
<transcript>: let's see

01:52:14
<transcript>: Let's see if it works.

01:52:17
<transcript>: Hit the button.

01:52:17
<transcript>: delete my

01:52:19
<transcript>: Delete my account go.

01:52:19
<transcript>: it needs some

01:52:24
<transcript>: It needs some ui work needs to tell you that it did or didn't work.

01:52:26
<transcript>: Okay.

01:52:26
<transcript>: we got

01:52:27
<transcript>: We got.

01:52:27
<transcript>: errors

01:52:29
<transcript>: Errors referring.

01:52:29
<transcript>: internal server

01:52:34
<transcript>: Internal server error. Okay. Oh, I got to look this one. And.

01:52:34
<transcript>: didn't work

01:52:38
<transcript>: Didn't work. No such customer customer. That.

01:52:40
mecoupz: you should ask david for a redesign

01:52:45
<transcript>: Stripe had already deleted. Okay, so we'd already deleted the stripe. Customer. Interesting.

01:52:50
<transcript>: So I just need to catch that if we've already deleted the stripe customer.

01:52:54
<transcript>: We see a catch.

01:52:58
<transcript>: Guess I'm going to do this.

01:53:03
<transcript>: Let's say.

01:53:03
<transcript>: try

01:53:05
<transcript>: Try.

01:53:07
<transcript>: Catch.

01:53:08
lazic88: Wait wait.. you're deleting it on Stripe, than in DB?

01:53:12
<transcript>: And we'll just say.

01:53:12
<transcript>: consol

01:53:14
<transcript>: Console error.

01:53:16
<transcript>: Okay.

01:53:24
<transcript>: Error deleting.

01:53:25
<transcript>: Stripe.

01:53:29
<transcript>: Customer.

01:53:29
<transcript>: probably already

01:53:31
<transcript>: Probably already deleted.

01:53:33
<transcript>: Already.

01:53:33
<transcript>: deleted

01:53:34
<transcript>: Deleted.

01:53:40
<transcript>: Okay, let's try again.

01:53:42
<transcript>: Third time's a charm.

01:53:45
aint313: did you guys look at Adyen? seems much better price wise compared to Stripe

01:53:49
<transcript>: You should ask David for a redesign. Yeah, Stamp. Use me some serious design work.

01:53:52
<transcript>: Lots of design help.

01:53:52
<transcript>: how much

01:53:56
<transcript>: How much does one Adam? One Stanley nickel. That's funny.

01:54:09
<transcript>: Wait. You're deleting it on stripe, then in db? Yes. Oh. Should I do it the other way around? Did you guys look at aidan? Seems much better price wise compared to stripe. Oh, no. What's Addion? Not even heard of addion.

01:54:12
lazic88: Is that operation transactional?

01:54:12
<transcript>: Okay. Here we go.

01:54:19
<transcript>: Update or delete on Table users violates form ask events user ID. What ask events.

01:54:30
<transcript>: So many things I'm going to have to work on, okay. Or just so many tables we have to clear from. So let's go here. I guess should we delete the user first and then delete stripe.

01:54:32
<transcript>: Guess that's fine.

01:54:36
grasp5533: Can I recommend someone to raid when you're done

01:54:37
<transcript>: Okay, we got to delete more stuff.

01:54:37
<transcript>: we got to add another

01:54:39
<transcript>: We got to add another table.

01:54:42
<transcript>: Another table. It's going to be called.

01:54:46
<transcript>: Ask event.

01:54:51
<transcript>: Ask.

01:54:54
<transcript>: Event table.

01:54:54
<transcript>: let's look

01:54:57
<transcript>: Let's look at what columns it has.

01:55:00
<transcript>: Masks, events.

01:55:00
<transcript>: ask

01:55:06
<transcript>: Ask events, not asks events, but ask events. Okay.

01:55:07
<transcript>: Sure.

01:55:07
<transcript>: id

01:55:14
<transcript>: Id. Ask ID. User ID. Visitor ID. Okay. All I care about is the user ID. And the ID, obviously.

01:55:19
<transcript>: So delete that ask event.

01:55:19
<transcript>: going to be

01:55:20
<transcript>: Going to be ask.

01:55:20
<transcript>: event

01:55:23
<transcript>: Event Ask Event table.

01:55:27
<transcript>: Okay.

01:55:29
<transcript>: Pool.

01:55:29
<transcript>: cool

01:55:30
<transcript>: Cool.

01:55:37
<transcript>: That operation. Transactional. Oh, we should do this all in a big transaction. Good call.

01:55:37
<transcript>: oops

01:55:39
<transcript>: Oops thanks ain't.

01:55:45
<transcript>: All right, that was lasik. Thank you, lazic, for that. Did you guys look at adian.

01:55:51
aint313: Adyen is basically Stripe, but cheaper.

01:55:57
<transcript>: Can I recommend someone to raid when you're done? Absolutely grasp. I would love to raid someone that you recommend. So we need to do this on a transaction. That's an excellent call. And if it fails, we should not delete the customer.

01:55:57
<transcript>: in the thing

01:56:01
<transcript>: In the thing. How do you do? Kaisely transactions, transactions.

01:56:01
<transcript>: just like that

01:56:03
pbertrand_dev: You need big volumes for Adyen

01:56:04
<transcript>: Just like that. Create the transaction builder.

01:56:07
<transcript>: Okay.

01:56:13
<transcript>: What do I pass in there.

01:56:13
<transcript>: okay

01:56:14
pbertrand_dev: Atleast when I checked last

01:56:14
lazic88: Exactly. But you will need to manually control transactions. I had the same case with deleting some stuff in DB and deleting images on S3 LuL

01:56:17
<transcript>: Okay. Here we go. Oh, there was an example, and I just skipped right past it.

01:56:17
<transcript>: cato

01:56:19
<transcript>: Cato.

01:56:23
iannery: sup adam

01:56:24
<transcript>: Wait DV transaction execute and then async pass the transaction.

01:56:29
<transcript>: Await sum function return.

01:56:34
<transcript>: Okay. So you can just do all this stuff in it. Wow.

01:56:36
<transcript>: Okay.

01:56:41
<transcript>: So you're telling me I could do other things like some function is not even a database transaction.

01:56:46
<transcript>: So it'll revert the transaction.

01:56:49
<transcript>: Okay.

01:56:57
lazic88: If you manually control it, yes.

01:57:09
<transcript>: If like a promise fails or something, this is incredible. Okay, you need big volumes for addion. Basically stripe but cheaper. Okay, at least when I check last. Exactly. But you will need to manually control transactions. Had the same case with deleting. Some stuff in db and deleting images on S three. If you mainly control it okay. What's up, lannery? What's going on.

01:57:13
dmmulroy: @sockthedev Are you in chat?

01:57:15
lazic88: E.g. trx.begin(); // do stuff trx.rollback() or trx.commit()

01:57:17
<transcript>: Lannery. What's cattle? What's that name? About? How about we call it transaction.

01:57:21
<transcript>: So execute transaction. Jennifer.

01:57:25
<transcript>: Put in here.

01:57:36
<transcript>: And then let's go up here. Let's see what's it doing. So execute. Take first or throw.

01:57:42
<transcript>: These just normal DB queries, right. Oh, some function passes the transaction.

01:57:46
<transcript>: And I guess in that function you would.

01:57:46
<transcript>: delete or

01:57:52
<transcript>: Delete or you would like cancel the transaction. If something fails, something unexpected happens that makes sense.

01:57:56
<transcript>: The problem is when we delete the stripe user.

01:58:03
<transcript>: I think I can just safely delete the Shype user only after a successful delete user transaction because.

01:58:10
<transcript>: I don't want any failure on stripe is not necessarily bad. It could be that we already believed this track customer or something else happened.

01:58:10
<transcript>: so i think that i'm going to do

01:58:13
<transcript>: So I think that I'm going to do it that way. Okay. And then we return.

01:58:16
<transcript>: All this.

01:58:18
<transcript>: So I can return.

01:58:24
<transcript>: The last one that I want to use or does that I want to do. So we'll just return this one.

01:58:34
<transcript>: Okay, we'll return that last one deleting user. Okay.

01:58:34
<transcript>: so

01:58:37
<transcript>: So Delete asks response.

01:58:40
<transcript>: Was I supposed to do something with the transaction.

01:58:45
<transcript>: Let's just do something.

01:58:55
<transcript>: Transaction insert into oh, so I don't just do db, I do transaction for everything. Okay. Got it.

01:58:55
<transcript>: got it

01:58:56
<transcript>: Got it.

01:58:58
<transcript>: Trx.

01:59:01
<transcript>: What.

01:59:01
<transcript>: oh

01:59:04
<transcript>: Oh, out there, here.

01:59:07
<transcript>: Trx, and then here.

01:59:10
<transcript>: Trx. Okay.

01:59:10
<transcript>: we're doing it in a

01:59:16
<transcript>: We're doing it in a transaction. Now, thank you so much for the tip lasik. That was silly of me.

01:59:16
<transcript>: example two

01:59:19
dmmulroy: @sockthedev I just merged a PR into tsc.nvim to default to using tsc for your local node_modules based on your feedback, give it a spin and lmk if it works https://github.com/dmmulroy/tsc.nvim/pull/4

01:59:21
harry_kd: hello adam, how you doin?

01:59:21
<transcript>: Example. Two X begin do stuff trx, rollback or commit. Okay. Got it.

01:59:21
<transcript>: i think we're going to

01:59:22
lazic88: SeemsGood

01:59:26
<transcript>: I think we're going to just do it this way with the execute and pass in the async thing.

01:59:26
<transcript>: what's

01:59:31
<transcript>: What's this do? Execute and return to promise delete result. Yeah. Okay.

01:59:31
<transcript>: so

01:59:37
<transcript>: So we're going to await that execute and then we'll just log the whole thing console.

01:59:37
<transcript>: log

01:59:38
<transcript>: Log.

01:59:42
<transcript>: Transaction.

02:00:09

02:00:10
<transcript>: Oh.

02:00:10
<transcript>: yeah that was

02:00:14
<transcript>: Yeah. That was yesterday. Sock said that you should do that.

02:00:22
<transcript>: What's this funky font? It's Operator mono. Hey, maliro, you got those last two points you needed. I'm so glad.

02:00:27
<transcript>: I saw that right. As I was ending the stream yesterday. Okay, so we delete these.

02:00:27
<transcript>: we're also going to

02:00:29
<transcript>: We're also going to delete.

02:00:35
<transcript>: We're not going to delete the other one. The Ask events. We're just going to remove the user ID from it.

02:00:35
<transcript>: so

02:00:37
<transcript>: So update.

02:00:37
sockthedev: @dmmulroy awesome, thanks doll!

02:00:37
<transcript>: ask

02:00:39
<transcript>: Ask users.

02:00:45
<transcript>: So this is going to be ask or ask events.

02:00:48
<transcript>: Events.

02:00:50
<transcript>: We're going to not delete from.

<transcript>: it should

02:01:23
maleero: Pretty sure I would have won if you streamed for another minute...

02:01:26
<transcript>: It should be so let's go back to the database that should be nullable.

02:01:30
<transcript>: I'm a female rebel.

02:01:30
<transcript>: this should be

<transcript>: Pretty sure I would have won if you streamed for another minute. Sorry, Meliro. Dax is fiddling with this dog right now. What? We should have commands that read from your dot files and return your editor to set up things in Chat. Oh, that'd be cool.

02:05:01
<transcript>: Sock, you're juggling dax, and my stream killing you. I'm so sorry, sock. You're going to have to just juggle.

<transcript>: Let's change that to your account.

02:06:36
<transcript>: Let's see. Stack, how many million of users are we talking about? Windward status has a few million. I'd have to pull up the numbers like in our analytics thing in terms of like, it depends on whether you're asking daily active, monthly active that kind of thing. But it's in the low millions.

02:06:38
<transcript>: Low millions.

02:06:41
<transcript>: We actually get.

02:06:41
<transcript>: about

02:06:52

sergioquijano: Hi! Kinda offtopic but, which font are you using? Looks really nice!

02:07:02
<transcript>: That's how many, like, we have thousands of pages at top rank. Basically, any sports stats question on Google, we're in like the top one or two. So we get a ton of inbound tracker from Google.

02:07:12
<transcript>: We now do over 2 million searches a day. So I think we spent our first three or four years without getting up to a million total searches. And now in the last year.

02:07:12
<transcript>: we do over

02:07:18
<transcript>: We do over 2 million a day. We're doing more in a day than we did our first four years at satin. Something like that. It's crazy.

02:09:37

02:09:39
<transcript>: Do I need to go get water. I need to send it to break just so I can get water. Do you think chai gbt is good for helping you write code? I do, luch. I think it's really good. In my experience it's been really good at helping me.

02:09:43
<transcript>: Helping me learn new stuff or get refamiliar.

02:09:43

yusufkhalifa51: !os

02:10:06
<transcript>: If you have a lot of context, it's super helpful if you're brand new to the industry and you're learning to code. I don't know if it's as helpful because you don't have some of the context. So when Chad gpt hallucinates and gives me like bad information or maybe it gives me outdated information like the api of some library has changed. I have the context to just fix that up. It's not a problem.

02:10:06
<transcript>: if you don't that

02:10:09
<transcript>: If you don't, that might be a problem.

02:10:20
cosmiclasagna: yeah chatgpt is a much better copilot when actually coding

02:10:20
spaceshot: chat gpt has been great to boost productivity when i've had to go do something i hadn't done in awhile.  after seeing its answer, now i can use it and/or go directly to what i needed in the docs

02:10:24
<transcript>: But experienced engineer learning a new language. I think it's super good at that. Like if I'm trying to learn how to be productive in some language I'm not familiar with. You can just ask it questions. It's like having an expert kind of in that language right next to you. It's really helpful.

02:10:24
<transcript>: okay

02:10:27
<transcript>: Okay, yusuf. Welcome to chat.

02:10:48
<transcript>: and or

02:10:56
<transcript>: And or go directly to what I needed in the docs. Yes, it's a la like fathom stream. Los an outdated information. But occasionally it was.

aj_stuyvenberg: chat GPT helped me a lot with a typescript package today. I had to write a shim for aws lambda response streaming, so typescript would quit yelling at me.

02:11:08
<transcript>: So yeah. Combined with experience as productive assistant, totally agree. I also love to use it to like scaffold out a component. If I'm like building a react component, it's great.

02:11:08
<transcript>: at like

02:11:24
<transcript>: At like, I can coach it into giving me a good first version. I hate the blank file problem. Like, I need to make a component for this. And there's, like, a whole lot of stuff I got to do. I know I can make, like, a snippet or something that would make it easier, but I've just I don't know, 15 years in I've never messed with snippets.

02:11:24
<transcript>: it's really great

02:11:30
<transcript>: It's really great for those things, though. Like, I need a component that does xyz. It gives me a good starting point.

02:11:30
<transcript>: it's

02:11:46
spaceshot: that's a good point, i have trouble staring at a blank file too

02:11:50
<transcript>: It's been so helpful for learning, okamel. As A. Jsts for ten years. Yeah, that's exactly what I love it for. Helps me keep clean up my functions. Yeah. Oh, we'd be really good at that too. Like doing code review of stuff. Like, hey, I wrote this electrode. I'm not a super into licker dev. Like, I don't use it a lot. Could you give me a more idiomatic version? It's really good at that.

02:11:50
<transcript>: makes it more a

02:11:54
<transcript>: Makes it more a lixary simplifies code. Pretty good.

02:11:54
<transcript>: okay

02:12:00
<transcript>: Okay. An expert on drugs. Yeah, exactly. It does hallucinate a little bit. So as long as you're okay with your experts.

02:12:03
<transcript>: Using psychedelics and stuff like that.

02:12:03
<transcript>: chat

02:12:18
<transcript>: Chattybd helps me a lot with Typescript package. Today I had to write a shim for aws lambda Response streaming so typescript would get yelling at me. It's a good point. I have trouble staring at a blank file too. Yeah, I hate the blank file problem. Okay, so let's ask some more questions. How many points did.

02:12:22
<transcript>: Who's another basketball player.

02:12:30
<transcript>: Yokich, I suppose Name Yoki, Yoki.

02:12:30

02:12:34
<transcript>: Is. It was A. J.

02:12:34
<transcript>: joke

02:12:35
<transcript>: yok

02:12:36
spaceshot: with a J

02:12:37
<transcript>: Yokik.

02:12:43
<transcript>: Indeed. I know that name indeed had this season. I'm just asking questions so I can go here.

02:12:43
<transcript>: to my account

02:12:44
<transcript>: To my account.

02:12:44
<transcript>: and see

02:13:05
<transcript>: And see here my history. Look at that history. My friend Eric coworker at Status. Just put a PR out to do that. Okay, now let's delete my account. Let's see what happens. First of all, let's pull it up in stripe and just see that we have a customer that's active Adam Test 25, right here. Who.

02:13:05
<transcript>: 's calling

02:13:06
<transcript>: 's Calling me.

02:13:14
<transcript>: So active customer. Right. And now what we're going to do is we're going to delete my account and we're going to see what happens.

02:13:17
<transcript>: We'll see what happens.

02:13:21
<transcript>: Looks like it may have succeeded.

02:13:21
<transcript>: oh

02:13:25
<transcript>: Oh account undefined. So what's the problem here.

02:13:25
<transcript>: it tried to redirect

02:13:30
<transcript>: It tried to redirect me to account undefined. I don't know why I did that.

02:13:30
<transcript>: but

02:13:32
<transcript>: But.

02:13:32
<transcript>: let's

02:13:35
<transcript>: Let's see if it deleted the user at least or the customer.

02:13:39
<transcript>: Sure did has been permanently deleted.

02:13:43
<transcript>: So I guess it canceled the subscription, too.

02:13:45
<transcript>: Canceled.

02:13:46
laytanl_: "I don't know why that"

02:13:54
<transcript>: Canceled it. This is fantastic. This feature was a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. Thought it was going to be pretty painful.

02:13:54
<transcript>: that's not so

02:13:54
laytanl_: Js

02:14:00
<transcript>: That's not so bad. I got to figure out the redirect. That's a silly thing at the end. But let's look and see.

02:14:00
<transcript>: if

02:14:04
<transcript>: If we go back to that news. Yeah. So we're not signed in now.

02:14:04
<transcript>: and delet

02:14:12
<transcript>: And deleted all the data from the database. What is other data that users could create with their user ID on it? That's going to cause this to fail when I'm expecting it to work.

02:14:17
<transcript>: I don't know why.

02:14:17
<transcript>: that did

02:14:20
<transcript>: That. Did I say that? I don't know why.

02:14:20
<transcript>: that

02:14:24
<transcript>: That JS are you just saying the answer is always JS? It's just JavaScript.

02:14:24
<transcript>: actually this

02:14:27
<transcript>: Actually, this would have been an elixir.

02:14:30
<transcript>: So can't blame JavaScript.

02:14:30
<transcript>: let's see why

02:14:34
<transcript>: Let's see, why did we not redirect Con to slash.

02:14:40
laytanl_: You said that

02:14:40
<transcript>: Why did we not.

02:14:40
<transcript>: is that

02:14:43
<transcript>: Is that not how it works.

02:14:43
<transcript>: oh i

02:14:45
<transcript>: Oh, I said that.

02:14:48
<transcript>: Redirect.

02:14:49
laytanl_: And the answer is always js

02:14:52
<transcript>: To slash.

02:14:56
<transcript>: To.

02:15:03
<transcript>: Client Home path.

02:15:06
ocelot2123: does your logout function already redirect?

02:15:06
<transcript>: Here we go. This is where we do.

02:15:08
rollie042: I think you can describe the table to see foreign keys?  \d <table>

02:15:10
<transcript>: A client HomePath index. Maybe that's what I need to do.

02:15:13
<transcript>: Client Home path.

02:15:18
<transcript>: Sign it. Here we go? Yeah.

02:15:18
<transcript>: if they're a

02:15:20
<transcript>: If they're a client homepath. Yeah, that's it.

02:15:20
<transcript>: okay

02:15:25
<transcript>: Okay. So let's go back here. Yeah. This is what we need to do.

02:15:30
<transcript>: Did it, did the thing.

02:15:30
<transcript>: we're

02:15:36
<transcript>: We're logging them out, which deletes our session. We're redirecting them to home. Let's test it all one more time.

02:15:36
<transcript>: i guess

02:15:44
<transcript>: I guess I should have some error handling, but also maybe just don't write code that has errors. You don't have to think about error handling. If you just write good code.

02:15:44
<transcript>: right

02:15:46
<transcript>: Right.

02:15:46
<transcript>: is that how it works

02:15:48
<transcript>: Is that how it works? Somebody tell me.

02:15:48
<transcript>: i

02:15:52
<transcript>: I'm an engineer of 15 years. Is that how it works.

02:15:52
<transcript>: strike

02:15:55
<transcript>: Strike good code don't have to think about it.

02:15:58
grasp5533: I hate using try/catch

02:16:03

02:16:04
ocelot2123: that should be another twitter video. "Just write good code"

02:16:09
<transcript>: Is that what you're implying? Does your logout function already readirect? Oh, oslot, maybe.

02:16:09
<transcript>: it's

02:16:11
<transcript>: It's possible.

02:16:14
<transcript>: We'll take a look.

02:16:14
<transcript>: let's

02:16:16
spaceshot: i actually have been in a meeting where they wanted to cut out testing and debugging time by just not creating bugs in the first place

02:16:16
<transcript>: Let's go ahead and do this part.

02:16:16
<transcript>: subscribe

02:16:17
<transcript>: Subscribe.

02:16:21
spaceshot: i didnt stay at that place much longer

02:16:29
<transcript>: I hate using track hatch. Me too. I think you can describe the table to see foreign keys. Yeah, I know. There's more foreign keys on it. I just don't know if any of them are active tables that we create data for.

02:16:29
<transcript>: idiot prov

02:16:30
nzlaura: hey adam, what're you using for authN/Z? using an IdP at all?

02:16:32
<transcript>: Idiot proving just creates better idiots exactly.

02:16:32
<transcript>: that should be another

02:16:41
<transcript>: That should be another Twitter video. Just write good code. That's really it. Hey, that should be a good one off lot. Thank you. That's a good teaser. I'm going to write that down. Hang on. I have a little note.

02:16:41
<transcript>: where

02:16:43
<transcript>: Where.

02:16:44
aj_stuyvenberg: okay but I'm bad at code

02:16:46
<transcript>: Iphone where I just add teaser ideas.

02:17:05
<transcript>: That is a good one. You guys will know when you see that one, that it was given to me by oslot. Actually, I've been in a meeting where they wanted to cut out testing and debugging time by just not creating bugs in the first place.

02:17:11
<transcript>: I didn't say that place much longer. That's funny. Let's look at our logout and let's see if it does.

02:17:11
<transcript>: reset

02:17:13
<transcript>: Reset session.

02:17:15
<transcript>: No redirect.

02:17:22
m2devdotnet: Strong engineering culture right there

02:17:23
<transcript>: No redirect here. So we got to redirect ourselves, which is okay, because I think it's going to work this time.

02:17:29
<transcript>: Adam Elmore.

02:17:29
<transcript>: okay

02:17:30
<transcript>: Okay.

02:17:33
<transcript>: Subscribe.

02:17:42
surlydev: I worked for a guy where we kept getting regression issues, and I brought up the subject of test drive development, and the guy looked at me and said "Why would you write code to test code?"

02:17:43
<transcript>: Hey, Adam, what are you using for off in Z using an idp at all? No, it's just a token. An email token. That's all we do.

02:17:51
<transcript>: Okay, but I'm bad at code. Well, then, aj, you're probably going to have to think about error handling and things like that, I'm afraid.

02:17:51
<transcript>: i'm afraid

02:17:52
leva16: will you write unit tests?

02:17:54
surlydev: my jaw just hit the desk and I was speechless. I just let him walk off

02:17:55
aj_stuyvenberg: dammit you're right

02:17:56
spaceshot: "dont have time to write tests" has been a very common thing throughout my whole career tbh

02:17:58
<transcript>: I'm afraid you'll have to think about it for us. We don't have to think about it because we're just good at code. How many.

02:18:02
<transcript>: Most points in a game.

02:18:11
mecoupz: alright i have to go. have a nice stream

02:18:12
<transcript>: Will you write unit test leva. Welcome to Chat. No, there are a lot of tests in this code base. I'm not going to be writing any for this feature.

02:18:12
<transcript>: doesn't

02:18:20
<transcript>: Doesn't mean you shouldn't. I'm just saying personal choice. I'm not going to be writing any. Let's see, go to your account.

02:18:20
<transcript>: history

02:18:27
<transcript>: History is working now if I delete, so I'm going to check and see if that ask ends up. Let's see.

02:18:27
<transcript>: do we actually have

02:18:36
<transcript>: Do we actually have trending? Does this page work? Yes. Okay. Most points again. This should still show up even after I delete my account. Right? That's what I'm looking for.

02:18:36
dmmulroy: @Grasp5533 I wish typescript had a way to statically type that a function can throw

02:18:38
<transcript>: Delete my account.

02:18:43
<transcript>: Yes ignore the fact that nothing happens.

02:18:43
<transcript>: account

02:18:48
<transcript>: Account undefined so I'm not redirecting correctly.

02:18:48
spaceshot: those are pretty nice results.  i like how it mapped out the top scoring games of all time in a graph

02:18:52
<transcript>: Why is it redirect to undefined.

02:18:52
<transcript>: so

02:18:54
<transcript>: So weird.

02:18:59
<transcript>: So confused.

02:19:03
<transcript>: Where is my thing? There it is. Undefined.

02:19:03
kedemel: That picture of JR is perfect, LOL

02:19:06
<transcript>: 401.

02:19:06
<transcript>: auth

02:19:08
<transcript>: Authorize, user.

02:19:12
<transcript>: Because I'm logging out.

02:19:15
<transcript>: It's.

02:19:21
<transcript>: I can't still be on this page. Is what it's saying, basically, like, get out of here.

02:19:24
<transcript>: Okay.

02:19:27
<transcript>: So maybe I don't want to do.

02:19:32
<transcript>: I'll just redirect if you're ever on this page.

02:19:34
<transcript>: Account. Let's see.

02:19:40
<transcript>: Oh, now, why am I on it right now.

02:19:54
<transcript>: I'm going to have it just redirect to home and not do the authorized plug. There's an authorized plug anyway, I'll show you. So let's go to trending. It's still there. That question is still there.

02:19:54
<transcript>: it's no longer

02:20:02
ocelot2123: @Kedemel should do the lebron on on the left LUL

02:20:06
<transcript>: It's no longer associated with my user. Okay, strong engineering culture. I work for a guy where he kept getting regression issues. And I brought up the subject of test drive development. Of test driven development. You got to look to me and said, Why would you write code to test code.

02:20:11
<transcript>: I love that sentence. Why would you write code to test code.

02:20:11
<transcript>: okay

02:20:16
<transcript>: Okay. My jaw just hit the desk, and I was speechless. I just let him walk off.

02:20:16
cosmiclasagna: gotta bounce adam and chat -- need to get like adam and dax and get some work done :D

02:20:20
techsavvytravvy: techsa10FerrisHyper

02:20:31
rollie042: If you write code to test code, don't you then need code to test the code that tests the code?  And then...

02:20:33
<transcript>: Don't have time to write tests. It's been a very common thing throughout my whole career. To be honest. Yeah, a lot of times the culture is not such that it's conducive to taking the time to write tests. The coops. All right, I have to go have a nice stream. Thanks, Mccoups. You have a nice day. I wish typescript had a way to statically type that a function can throw.

02:20:40
<transcript>: Oh, yeah? That's what languages do that I know of languages that do that what ones do? Dml. Roy.

02:20:42
rollie042: Java

02:20:43
rollie042: and it sucks

02:20:46
rollie042: and C++

02:20:47
<transcript>: Am I thinking of Swift.

02:20:47
<transcript>: those are pretty

02:20:52
<transcript>: Those are pretty nice results. I like how it mapped out the top score games of all time in a graph.

02:20:56
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, thanks. Spaceshot. That statue.

02:20:59
<transcript>: In a nutshell that picture of Jr. Is perfect.

02:21:02
<transcript>: Should do the LeBron on the left.

02:21:13
<transcript>: Got a bounce. See a cosmic need to get like Adam and dax and get some word done. Yeah, exactly. We're all trying to be productive. If you write code to test code, don't you? Then need to code to test the code that tests the code.

02:21:13
<transcript>: great

02:21:27
<transcript>: Great point. Another excellent observation, java. And it sucks. And C plus plus. Maybe I'm thinking of java. I was thinking of a different language. I can't remember which language that you can explicitly say. This function can throw.

02:21:31
<transcript>: Maybe it was java, but I thought it was something else.

02:21:33
spaceshot: @rollie042 I worked at a banking place where the business analysts said exactly that

02:21:37
spaceshot: Java has checked exceptions

02:21:40
<transcript>: Okay. So we got to fix something. We got to fix this. So after we log out, the problem is.

02:21:44
<transcript>: We're no longer allowed to be on the page that we're on.

02:21:44
<transcript>: so what

02:21:46
<transcript>: So what we need to do.

02:21:50
<transcript>: What we need to do.

02:22:00
<transcript>: I wish I could log out asynchronously in the background. I can't redirect first. Can I.

02:22:00
<transcript>: now

02:22:04
<transcript>: Now, once I redirect that's like the end. Right.

02:22:07
<transcript>: Or can I.

02:22:07
<transcript>: redirect

02:22:09
<transcript>: Redirect and then do the log out.

02:22:09
spaceshot: where you basically say "this function throws this" and i think you as the caller have to catch it but i'm not 100% sure about that

02:22:23
maleero: I can't relate. I can't imagine not writing unit tests for some of the things I work on. It would just be too complicated and take too long to test everything manually

02:22:23
<transcript>: Worked at a banking place where the business analyst said exactly that java has checked exceptions or where you basically say this function throws this and I think you as the caller have to catch it. But I'm not 100% sure about that. Got you.

02:22:26
<transcript>: Okay.

02:22:32
dmmulroy: I'm leaning more and more to writing my next FE app with Reason after having started learning OCaml coupled with getting burnt by TS warts time and again

02:22:37
joshfinnie: random question, is your camera positioned vertically or is that just cropped and still looks good?

02:22:47
<transcript>: Can't relate. Can't imagine not running unit tests for some of the things I work on, it would just be too complicated and take too long to test everything manually. Yeah. So I will say maliro the time that I write tests or when I need them at author time. I write unit tests at all their time. Because I can't write this function without the unit test, I need it to help me get the implementation.

02:22:47
<transcript>: right

02:22:48
<transcript>: Right.

02:22:52
<transcript>: But then they're a lot less valuable later for me and I know.

02:22:58
<transcript>: I've done all the other things. I know integration tests are best. I know all the tropes.

02:22:58
<transcript>: ra

02:22:59
<transcript>: Random question.

02:22:59
<transcript>: is your camera

02:23:03
<transcript>: Is your camera position vertically or is that just cropped and still looks good.

02:23:07
<transcript>: It is cropped.

02:23:07
<transcript>: it's

02:23:11
<transcript>: It's a very wide angle lens. So this is like an eleven millimeter.

02:23:11
<transcript>: it's like

02:23:13
<transcript>: It's like fisheye. Almost.

02:23:13
<transcript>: it

02:23:16
<transcript>: It's just pretty good at not distorting.

02:23:16
<transcript>: but

02:23:19
<transcript>: But it allows me to get this kind of, like, full frame.

02:23:20
aj_stuyvenberg: wideGuy

02:23:24
<transcript>: But the sides are just cropped. Yeah, that's right.

02:23:25
goodgrandpaa: @joshfinnie He's rich Kappa

02:23:42
<transcript>: Let's see I'm leaning more and more to riding my next front end app with reason after having started learning a camel couple coupled with getting burnt by T. S. Wartime and time again. Interesting deal. Really. I would love to look at that code base if you open source it randall question is your camera.

02:23:42
<transcript>: wide

02:23:46
<transcript>: Wide Guy. Okay, let's see.

02:23:54
<transcript>: User redirect. So what I need to do is I need to go to the account controller. Account controller here.

02:23:59
<transcript>: And we need to say Index redirect the settings.

02:23:59
<transcript>: show

02:24:01
<transcript>: Show here's where we're going to redirect.

02:24:03
<transcript>: If.

02:24:06
<transcript>: There's not a user.

02:24:09
<transcript>: We're going to redirect.

02:24:09
<transcript>: here

02:24:13
<transcript>: Here. Right. And I'm going to remove this.

02:24:16
<transcript>: Authorized user thing.

02:24:19
<transcript>: So if no user.

02:24:23
<transcript>: This is just a classic I need to match on user, right.

02:24:26
<transcript>: Case.

02:24:28
<transcript>: Get current user.

02:24:31
<transcript>: Do.

02:24:33
<transcript>: The case.

02:24:40
<transcript>: Yeah case get current user and then if there's nil.

02:24:42
<transcript>: We're going to redirect.

02:24:50
<transcript>: Yes find HomePath exactly otherwise user we're going to do all this stuff.

02:24:55
<transcript>: Right.

02:24:57
<transcript>: Perfect.

02:25:10
<transcript>: Nailed it. We sink. We think I nailed it. Now, instead of using the plug that does off check, we're just going to do it like this. If there is no user redirect.

02:25:15
<transcript>: It should actually accomplish our redirect for us.

02:25:15
<transcript>: but i'm just going

02:25:19
<transcript>: But I'm just going to see if the code as it stands, works.

02:25:25
<transcript>: Okay. Here we go. So now if I go to.

02:25:33
<transcript>: Well, let's take them so it's just recompiling. Okay if I go to account.

02:25:37
<transcript>: Redirect me? Yeah.

02:25:37
<transcript>: now

02:25:39
<transcript>: Now if I go sign up.

02:25:39
<transcript>: and

02:25:42
<transcript>: And let's do 26.

02:25:48
<transcript>: Time to stop, muse.

02:26:00
<transcript>: Last test. Now I got to get some water.

02:26:02
rollie042: You really need a button 'create new account and sign me in'

02:26:06
<transcript>: Time is it almost ten. I can make it till the end. Then we're almost done around here.

02:26:06
<transcript>: okay

02:26:10
<transcript>: Okay. You really need a button, create new account and sign me in.

02:26:10
<transcript>: oh yeah

02:26:12
<transcript>: Oh Yeah.

02:26:12
<transcript>: for stripes

02:26:14
<transcript>: For stripes. That'd be great.

02:26:18
spaceshot: cant believe you used your real credit card info there

02:26:22
rollie042: I mean just for testing in general

02:26:23
<transcript>: Okay. Here it goes. We bought it. I'm going to go to my account.

02:26:26
<transcript>: Settings.

02:26:32
<transcript>: We're going to say let's make some. I don't need to test that anymore. Delete my account. Just do it.

02:26:32
<transcript>: just delet

02:26:34
<transcript>: Just delete it.

02:26:36
<transcript>: Just for testing in general. Yeah.

02:26:40
<transcript>: Why.

02:26:40
<transcript>: is it

02:26:42
<transcript>: Is it doing that.

02:26:46
<transcript>: Why.

02:26:46
<transcript>: it's always the dum

02:26:51
<transcript>: It's always the dumb little stuff you get the thing that you think is going to be hard, you get it done so easy.

02:26:56
<transcript>: And then it's just stupid stuff. Like redirecting. I can't figure out.

02:27:01
<transcript>: Well.

02:27:06
<transcript>: Why would it be doing git account undefined.

02:27:18
<transcript>: Weird.

02:27:21
<transcript>: I don't understand.

02:27:23
<transcript>: What is happening.

02:27:33
<transcript>: Can't believe you use your real credit card info. There.

02:27:35
<transcript>: It's funny.

02:27:40
<transcript>: I'm hungry. I'm not going to make it to the end.

02:27:43
<transcript>: I can't make it ASMR.

02:27:45
<transcript>: You like that.

02:27:45
<transcript>: nice

02:27:47
<transcript>: Nice. Who likes that.

02:27:47
<transcript>: who like

02:27:49
<transcript>: Who likes that sound.

02:27:49
<transcript>: one's in chat

02:27:52
<transcript>: One's in Chat if you like that sound.

02:27:52
goodgrandpaa: +1

02:27:56
schrew: +1

02:27:57
<transcript>: I don't think I've ever asked for ones in chat.

02:27:57
jokestera_e: 1

02:27:59
<transcript>: Good grandpa likes it.

02:28:02
jokestera_e: What flavor you got today

02:28:05
<transcript>: Look at that. So many people like that sound.

02:28:05
<transcript>: same flavor

02:28:09
<transcript>: Same flavor as every day peanut butter chocolate chip.

02:28:11
spaceshot: im sleepy all of a sudden

02:28:15
<transcript>: I also have some other flavors I might eat.

02:28:20
<transcript>: Okay.

02:28:24
<transcript>: So we almost got it done today.

02:28:25
jokestera_e: you gotta try blueberry muffin and lemon bar

02:28:26
<transcript>: Almost.

02:28:28
goodgrandpaa: @SpaceShot I feel that. Been sleepy since 6:30am my time LUL

02:28:32
<transcript>: I'm going to have to work on the rest of it. Offline.

02:28:35
<transcript>: Because we got things to do.

02:28:43
<transcript>: You're sleepy all of a sudden.

02:28:43
<transcript>: from me eating

02:28:44
<transcript>: From me eating a lar.

02:28:52
<transcript>: Blueberry muffin and lemon bar. So jokester. I've tried them all. I think mostly most all of them.

02:28:54
goodgrandpaa: When do we get the next podcast episode btw?

02:28:54
spaceshot: tha asmr

02:28:57
<transcript>: Not a big fan of the fruit ones. They're good. They're just nothing like this.

02:29:07
<transcript>: Bye thank you for the follow.

02:29:13
<transcript>: Next podcast episode Good grandpa. We skipped last week because React Miami.

02:29:13
<transcript>: we got

02:29:15
<transcript>: We got to record like today.

02:29:15
<transcript>: or

02:29:17
<transcript>: Or tomorrow.

02:29:20
goodgrandpaa: Oh cool!

02:29:22
<transcript>: So Monday. Good grandpa, you'll get your next episode.

02:29:30
<transcript>: Got to figure out what to do with the podcast.

02:29:36
<transcript>: I enjoy it. I just enjoy having a time on the calendar where me and dad.

02:29:36
<transcript>: just talk

02:29:38
<transcript>: Just talk.

02:29:43
<transcript>: But I think we should be putting little bits of it.

02:29:43
<transcript>: on

02:29:48
goodgrandpaa: I think gave Dax an idea that he might've forwarded to you

02:29:49
<transcript>: On short form video platforms and stuff. I think there's a lot more we should be doing to try.

02:29:50
goodgrandpaa: oh yeah that's true!

02:29:52
goodgrandpaa: Tiktok!

02:29:52
<transcript>: To amplify the message.

02:29:58
goodgrandpaa: Not to be zoomer, but tiktok algo is wild.

02:30:00
<transcript>: I think gave dax an idea that he might afford you. Which one was it? Tiktok. Yeah. We should put him on TikTok.

02:30:05
<transcript>: I think we should do that.

02:30:10
goodgrandpaa: I actually don't recall the idea LUL

02:30:11
<transcript>: Tiktok is Wild dirt. Thank you for the follow. Yeah.

02:30:12
jokestera_e: a yt channel is good and you could put you last interview up there

02:30:15
<transcript>: I think we need to do something to get the message out a little better.

02:30:15
<transcript>: we're going to have to be

02:30:17
<transcript>: We're going to have to be a little spicier. Probably.

02:30:25
<transcript>: Youtube channel is good. And you could put your last interview up there. Yeah, we should do that, too. We should put it on YouTube. We talked about it on that.

02:30:31
<transcript>: All right.

02:30:36
<transcript>: Feels weird to go back and work now.

02:30:40
<transcript>: So pretty short one today. Two and a half hours.

02:30:40
<transcript>: started

02:30:42
<transcript>: Started late.

02:30:47
<transcript>: But how fun. I love it. I love hanging out with you people.

02:30:47
