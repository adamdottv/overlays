teej_dv: I wasted my precious bathroom time on this?!??

00:03:12
goodgrandpaa: @teej_dv the goat! love to see ya here :)

00:03:49
teej_dv: How funny would it be if later Adam revealed "you had a chance at a MacBook. It was just that the chance was zero"

00:04:13
goodgrandpaa: LUL

00:04:18
goodgrandpaa: It's pretty close to 0 haha

00:04:37
teej_dv: Obviously. I've spent thousands and thousands of adamcoin on this

00:04:50
goodgrandpaa: LUL you must really need that new macbook!

00:05:03
teej_dv: I am just going to regift it from my channel!

00:05:07
teej_dv: I don't even like mac

00:05:13
goodgrandpaa: I love it. beautiful proxy.

00:05:38
vimcerf: you and dax are head to head trying to get a macbook to regift then LUL

00:05:39
cosmiclasagna: will you create your own scam algorithm for the giveaway @teej_dv

00:05:40
rodneypk: Good morning

00:06:15
teej_dv: @cosmiclasagna ill gift the MacBook after a random drawing for everyone who UNFOLLOWS Adam

00:06:49
teej_dv: KEKW

00:07:07
teej_dv: Good thing Adam will never read this cause he's 45 minutes behind in chat.

00:07:12
goodgrandpaa: @teej_dv you can build a bot too. Ensure that at the time of the drawing they are not following them. Imagine the usage Kappa

00:07:22
goodgrandpaa: True, you'll already have won it. Kappa

00:07:26
teej_dv: Exactly.

00:07:34
vimcerf: you have priority with your checkmark teej,this might backfire

00:07:45
rvnn: catJAM

00:07:53
goodgrandpaa: he might send you a macbook just because of the checkmark Kappa

00:07:53
teej_dv: OK, gotta run. Bye chat. Tell Adam I said hi. And if he reads these, then clip his reaction 😂

00:08:10
goodgrandpaa: @teej_dv Take care teej! enjoy your precious bathroom time!

00:08:16

freedomdao: also gotta GPT4 api i dev'ed a GUI for it...

00:09:33
cowfacedev: Btw, aren't you supposed to be flying to Florida today? (it will be forever till adam reads this LUL)

00:09:50
freedomdao: to be 100% honest. gpt4 api is nuts but the chatgpt plugins is gpt5

00:10:01
freedomdao: we are doing Loop AI. (self thinking)

00:10:29

00:12:51
mehulsharmamat: @thdxr nope. just a simple t3/nextjs thing

00:12:51
<transcript>: Scrolling, scrolling. You and dax are head to head, trying to get a backbook to regift, then. Oh, you're talking to Ted. You create your own scam algorithm. It's not a scam.

00:12:58
<transcript>: Good thing Adam will never read this because he's 45 and sign in chat. I am always so mine in chat. I'm going to try and do better.

00:13:00
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:13:04
thdxr: doesn’t t3 use prisma

00:13:08

thdxr: what issue?

00:13:12
<transcript>: Raven. I've had so much trouble with your name.

00:13:14
<transcript>: I need vowels.

00:13:36
<transcript>: well the plug

00:13:44
<transcript>: Well, the plugins. And then also, I could create a plugin. I'd love to look at one. If you've created one, are you supposed to be flying to Florida today.

00:13:49
<transcript>: It will be forever. Till Adam reads this. I'm not that far behind.

00:13:49

I'm going to just be over here working. You guys, you hang out with tej to be 100% honest. Gpt four API is nuts. That the Chat gbt plugin is GPT five. Wait, what.

00:14:17
<transcript>: The plugins is gpt five is it we are doing loop AI self thinking.

00:14:17
<transcript>: whoa

00:15:18
dyalicode: good morning

00:15:18
freedomdao: this is the idea. using llama + gptneo+gpt4 api + chatgpt plugins. intercommunication with 4 models. Still a work in progress. https://github.com/graylan0/intercom-chatgpt-plugin/blob/main/intercom.zip

00:15:18
<transcript>: For the thing.

00:15:22
<transcript>: The video to export. It was a long video. I recorded.

00:15:22
<transcript>: like

00:15:31
<transcript>: Like it's prores high quality four K. I mean, it was a lot of video, but still it took so long. I should have started last night. You're really.

00:15:31
<transcript>: heating dax

00:15:35
charafmrah: time to try Java with Spring Boot next?

00:15:35
<transcript>: Heating dax on his ice. On your hair. There. Yeah, I know. It's a great improvement.

00:15:35
<transcript>: apparently

00:15:44
<transcript>: Apparently pushing it up is better. I don't know. I feel like I've gone back and forth on this with my wife. We couldn't figure out they both look bad. Just which looks less bad.

00:15:48
oskrm: *sad banned country because its blocked by OpenAI*

00:15:49
<transcript>: And dax reminded me. I hate to give dax credit for anything.

00:15:49
<transcript>: but it's

00:15:55
<transcript>: But it's true I'm using ssd and running to problems with assuming you're shouting at me for getting to.

00:16:18
<transcript>: Using Prisma. Please don't be using Prisma. Hey, Adam, what's up, folky? What's going on? Just a simple T three. Next js thing. Doesn't T three use Prisma.

00:16:27
freedomdao: @oskrM try messing around with the Vicuna Llama model here  https://huggingface.co/eachadea/legacy-ggml-vicuna-7b-4bit its very good

00:16:31
<transcript>: I feel like there's going to be an easy answer for this one. Mayhol I just don't know what it is.

00:16:31
<transcript>: good morning

00:16:36
<transcript>: Good morning, shrew. Today's gonna be a good day? It's gonna be a great day.

00:16:36
<transcript>: such

00:16:38
<transcript>: Such a great day.

00:16:38
<transcript>: wait

00:16:44
<transcript>: Wait, why don't you like Prisma? Because Prisma is big. It big.

00:16:53
<transcript>: It's not good in serverless context. It just doesn't do well when you put it on to like functions as a service platforms.

00:17:07
rvnn: Howdy adam dot dev

00:17:10
<transcript>: Pulp starts, et cetera. You said 9th in the Talking About Nothing podcast. 9th. Oh, I said, oh, 19th. I'm sorry, cafes. It's the 19th we leave on the 19th. My hair is really pointy. I know it feels weird to push my hair up.

00:17:13
<transcript>: It's like effort.

00:17:13
<transcript>: in my appearance

00:17:14
<transcript>: In my appearance just feels weird.

00:17:14
<transcript>: i don

00:17:20
<transcript>: I don't know. I've just kind of, like, not tried for so long, but when I tried, I just feel uncomfortable.

00:17:20
<transcript>: adam

00:17:20
thdxr: @cowfacedev have something potentially spicy for today

00:17:22
<transcript>: Adam. Php.

00:17:28
<transcript>: That's funny. I was just trying to pinpoint what was new with this hair. Yeah, I pushed it up.

00:17:28
<transcript>: i pushed

00:17:30
<transcript>: I pushed it upward.

00:17:30
<transcript>: i don't know

00:17:31
mehulsharmamat: okay srs question: having to use aws now for my project, BUT the internal api routes respond VERY LATE sometimes bc of operations. EC2 or lambda? (lambda just feels wrong even with the 15m timeout)

00:17:36
<transcript>: I don't know. I'm not completely sold. I think it's too long right now to be pushed upward.

00:17:36
<transcript>: if it

00:17:39
rvnn: hey if you have it, flaunt it

00:17:39
<transcript>: If it were a little shorter, I think it would be okay.

00:17:54
<transcript>: But good morning. Dialy Dioli haven't seen it in a long time. Freedom doubt this is the idea using llama plus gpt, neo plus jeep D Four api plus Chan gbd plugins intercommunication with four models still a work in progress. Whoa.

00:17:55
thdxr: never use ec2

00:17:59
cowfacedev: Pin'point' LUL

00:18:08
<transcript>: Oh, it's a zip. You're handing me a zip file? Do I download this whole thing? And I can run it myself. Time to try java with Spring Boot. Next. Maybe I'm just opened up to a whole world outside of JavaScript.

00:18:08
<transcript>: like i

00:18:09
schrew: @mehulsharmamat Can you decouple requests from responses using SQS?

00:18:12
<transcript>: Like I want to try all the things I've already done. A lot of rail stuff.

00:18:12
<transcript>: i do

00:18:14
thdxr: if you have an api response that’s slow it shouldn’t be synchronous restructure it to be async

00:18:16
dyalicode: gpt using solidjs ??

00:18:16
rvnn: VBScript

00:18:23
thdxr: 30s timeout in apig

00:18:23
theapexpredator141: When is the Laravel vid dropping?

00:18:26
<transcript>: I do worry. So the knock on rails for me, it's like, yeah, very productive. It's nice that all the rails code bases kind of look the same and you're familiar in all of them, but it's just not good with deployment, which makes sense because it's run by a complete dork.

00:18:26
<transcript>: in dh

00:18:31
goodgrandpaa: Java/Spring v nice imo. but that's just 2 years experience in Java ;)

00:18:31
<transcript>: In dhh, but it's like you have to deploy rails a certain way.

00:18:31
<transcript>: you can't

00:18:34
<transcript>: You can't break it up into pieces.

00:18:34
<transcript>: it's just like

00:18:38
<transcript>: It's just like Big thing drop on vm or container or whatever.

00:18:38
<transcript>: that's

00:18:41
mehulsharmamat: @mehulsharmamat those are words for sure. could you explain what you mean lol very new to this

00:18:52
<transcript>: That's my problem. And I worry that rails is going to or that laravel is going to be like that. But I don't know that. And I know there's laravel vapor, which is supposed to be like some serverless deployment option. So I want to look at it. We'll see.

00:18:55
<transcript>: Sad band country because it's blocked by OpenAI.

00:19:01
<transcript>: I hear that countries do that time from time to time. They block things like OpenAI.

00:19:01
<transcript>: by the way

00:19:06
<transcript>: By the way, love the flame that you're flaming about Edge on Twitter.

00:19:16
<transcript>: Try messing with the vicuna llama model here. Hugging face. Okay, it's very good. I think you think I know more than I do. Freedom.

00:19:19
thdxr: i’ll talk to you in discord open a thread in help

00:19:23
<transcript>: I have played with some of this stuff a little bit. I think I got a stable diffusion thing running.

00:19:23
<transcript>: on

00:19:29
mehulsharmamat: @thdxr yep! waiting for the sst thing to fail asap

00:19:34
dmmulroy: Gm y'all

00:19:38
<transcript>: On aws once or no. I started to I got it running in like just Google collabs, so I don't know anything, but I have downloaded some hugging face models and I know some of the hugging face ml engineers because they're aws heroes. And I met the memory event.

00:19:38
<transcript>: howdy

00:19:44
freedomdao: no worries . google colab is a great start point to do AI. i use it for our stack.

00:19:45
<transcript>: Howdy raven has something potentially spicy for today. Oh, I can't wait to publish, publish, publish.

00:19:45
<transcript>: push

00:19:49
thdxr: if it’s a new aws account sometimes you get that econ reset problem for a bit

00:19:54
<transcript>: Push it. Have you finished the testing? Dax, is the testing complete? Okay, serious question. How many use? Aws. Now for my project, but.

00:20:04
thdxr: @adamdotdev no gonna do it on stream

00:20:06
<transcript>: The internal api wraps respond very late sometimes because of operations. Ec Two or Lambda Lambda just feels wrong, even with the 15 minutes timeout. Wait. What.

00:20:06
<transcript>: what

00:20:07
schrew: @mehulsharmamat You can have an endpoint that listens, and posts relevant data as an event in SQS. Then later, you can have compute resources (ec2/ecs/lambda) process the events in sqs.

00:20:08
<transcript>: What is your project? Mayhew.

00:20:17
<transcript>: I'm missing some context. The internal api wraps respond very late, sometimes because of operations. What kind of operations.

00:20:20
oskrm: @freedomdao I built some QA bot using google colab. pretty cool

00:20:20
bishopdev: adam's going for a new hair do

00:20:22
nexxeln: hi adam

00:20:23
<transcript>: Kind of operations. Lambda just feels wrong even with the 15 minutes timeout.

00:20:30
<transcript>: If you have it flaunted. Oh, the hair. Never use EC two. There's your answer.

00:20:30
<transcript>: there was

00:20:35
<transcript>: There was a case stacked where I had to use EC Two, and I'd be curious if you would try and find some way around it.

00:20:40
<transcript>: I guess I could have used fargate. Maybe something like that.

00:20:40
<transcript>: but

00:20:41
<transcript>: But.

00:20:44
<transcript>: It was this.

00:20:44
<transcript>: three d

00:20:50
<transcript>: 3d. Like a virtual reality. What is it called it's a Google technology, I think.

00:21:06
mehulsharmamat: button click -> whole api get routes to each other internally -> final response to the client  after the button click it can take ~15-30mins depending on response.  anyway ill post in the sst server i know this is super vague haha

00:21:10
<transcript>: Where it's like a shared 3d environment. Pixel streaming. So it does all the server, all the rendering, the GP, like the gpu rendering. All the 3d graphics are rendered on the server, but you stream to the client. It's called Pixel streaming, and there's some technology I can't remember now. It was an Nvidia.

00:21:10
<transcript>: thing maybe

00:21:16
<transcript>: Thing. Maybe. I don't know. There's some kind of a technology for doing Pixel streaming. Oh, it was an unreal technology.

00:21:16
<transcript>: yeah

00:21:19
<transcript>: Yeah, unreal engine anyway.

00:21:25
<transcript>: I could not do that in a serverless context. One. You have to have GPUs.

00:21:28
<transcript>: So that limits your options immediately.

00:21:28
<transcript>: i couldn't even

00:21:33
owencodes: HeyGuys

00:21:33
thdxr: i wouldn’t use ec2 for that i just wouldn’t build that

00:21:34
mehulsharmamat: @mehulsharmamat OOOH! yeah that could def be helpful

00:21:41
<transcript>: I couldn't even use fargate because fargate didn't have access to gpu instances, at least at the time they were supposed to be adding it. It was on the roadmap anyway. I had to use EC. Two instances. Straight, raw EC, two instances like a caveman.

00:21:46
<transcript>: Can you do couple requests from Response using sqs.

00:21:48
<transcript>: Where would I miss.

00:21:53
<transcript>: If you have API response to the flow shouldn't be synchronous. Restructured.

00:21:53
<transcript>: gpt

00:21:56
<transcript>: Gpt using solid JS.

00:21:57
<transcript>: No.

00:21:57
<transcript>: i don't think i'll

00:21:58
oskrm: gpu edge: you rent your neighbour's gpu

00:22:08
<transcript>: I don't think I'll do anything with solid js. I don't think I'll be building any front ends, just going to do some poking around with the gpt api. There is something I want to build that I think gpt would make.

00:22:08
<transcript>: a lot easier

00:22:09
<transcript>: A lot easier.

00:22:09
<transcript>: and

00:22:13
naxodev: hey Adam!

00:22:14
sockthedev: i feel like this stream is just adam flexing his ability to read

00:22:19
<transcript>: And maybe we'll start building it. Maybe. I don't know. I'm working on the rewrite it's stat music again. I'll start streaming that again soon, but I want to stream some other things before I get into.

00:22:19
<transcript>: months long streaming

00:22:22
<transcript>: Months long streaming of Status stuff.

00:22:22
<transcript>: vb sc

00:22:23
nexxeln: when are we gonna do laravel

00:22:29
naxodev: hey chat!

00:22:32
<transcript>: Vb script? What 37 timeout in api gateway? When is the laravel vid dropping? Great question, Apex predator, welcome to Chat. First of all, second of all.

00:22:32
<transcript>: i'm

00:22:52
mehulsharmamat: put stuff in /help @thdxr cc'd you. lmk if you need more info about set up / creds etc

00:22:52
<transcript>: I'm working with an editor. So I realize the bottleneck for putting out YouTube videos is me. And it's how long it takes me to edit a video because I can shoot. I can write and record a video in, like, an hour. And then it takes me, like, six to edit it. So I've hired an editor editor. It's flip. I mean, you probably all know.

00:22:52
<transcript>: flip

00:22:55
<transcript>: Flip from Prime.

00:22:55
<transcript>: i hired

00:22:58
<transcript>: I hired Flip in the past, and then I was like.

00:22:58
<transcript>: i

00:23:01
<transcript>: I should understand editing so I can make better videos.

00:23:13
<transcript>: Now I'm in the stage where I'm like, no, I'm just going to record stuff, and I'm going to hand it to Flip. So whenever Flip gets it done, that's the answer. Apex present. I don't know when that'll be torto dev. Thank you so much for the follow. Also.

00:23:13
<transcript>: niks

00:23:19
theapexpredator141: Thanks!

<transcript>: And brain lack. All the other people were when I was sleeping and I appreciate YouTube. I don't know if any of you are here.

00:23:45
dmdboi: He's so far behind, lets start a game of noughts and crosses

00:23:55
schrew: I'll start: nought

00:23:57
noob_cod3r: 👋

00:24:01
<transcript>: Java Spring. Very nice. That's just two years experience in java. Those words are words for sure. Could you explain what you mean? Okay, you guys are going to talk in discord. Good morning, dia millroy. No worries. Google Call. I was great. Start with Jay. Use a firestack. Okay. If it's a new aws account, sometimes you get that econ reset problem for a bit.

00:24:03
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:24:05
freedomdao: also my friend has a really well polished plugin that may inspire some ideas. uses Puppeteer to give gpt vision (its what the new GPT4 web browser is based upon) https://github.com/graylan0/GPTVision-plugin

00:24:06
<transcript>: Going to do it on stream. Oh, nice.

00:24:06
<transcript>: dax when

00:24:09
<transcript>: Dax, when are we recording today? Did you say 10:00 a.m.

00:24:13
nexxeln: x _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

00:24:19
thdxr: yeah 10am

00:24:19
<transcript>: 10:00 a.m.. Eastern. Is that what you said? I don't care what time, whatever time you can have an endpoint that listens and posts relevant data as an event next year.

00:24:19
<transcript>: okay

00:24:24
oskrm: x _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ___

00:24:31
<transcript>: Okay. Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling, scrolling. Next is here. And naxo is here. Gpu. Edge. You rent your neighbor's gpu. What.

00:24:31
<transcript>: wouldn't use e

00:24:34
<transcript>: Wouldn't use EC Two for that. I just wouldn't build that.

00:24:36
<transcript>: That's funny.

00:24:38
schrew: I'll finish: crosses

00:24:50
<transcript>: Going for a new hairdo. Yeah, I know. Okay. I'm going back to the old hair. Thank you, Bishop, for pointing it out. You're about the 7th person on stream who's been like, What's going on with your hair? I'm done with it. I'm going back to.

00:24:52
dmmulroy: nah dude new hair is fire

00:24:56
<transcript>: It's not going to say down, oh, now it's just the worst of all worlds.

00:25:00
bishopdev: I just joined, I'm not wondering what's going on with it, I'm digging it :D

00:25:01
<transcript>: Here we go. I've got this hat. And I never wear it.

00:25:01
nexxeln: i think adam looks great with the new hair

00:25:09
<transcript>: Database. I look like such a nerd in a hat.

00:25:11
l33t_rose: New hair looks good

00:25:16
<transcript>: Let's see Hi nick's button click whole api route gets okay.

00:25:19
nexxeln: he looks like the guitarist in a rock band

00:25:23
<transcript>: Your neighbor's gpu. I feel like this stream is just Adam flexing his ability to read.

00:25:34
nft_scam: 🤓🧢 yo check out my cool database hat

00:25:40
dmdboi: @nexxeln x _ _ o _ _ _ _ _

00:25:42
<transcript>: That's funny. What am I going to do, Laravel? Soon? Maybe. I don't know. Probably not. I don't know if I'll do it on stream. I am going to play with it more. I just know nothing about php. So all the code. That the starter templates, that's the other thing. Laravel cranks out like an insane amount of code in the starter projects.

00:25:44
mehulsharmamat: i dont dislike php

00:25:44
<transcript>: I'm used to javascript land where.

00:25:54
oskrm: @nexxeln x _ _ o _ _ _ x _

00:25:55
<transcript>: When we do like Create Next app, there's like four files. And they'll have like six lines in them. And they're also cute in laravel. You're like Create new laravel app. And I use Jet stream.

00:25:55
<transcript>: i mean

00:26:07
<transcript>: I mean, like it's not just a base layer of the lap. The jet stream is like their project starter thing, but it's like hundreds of files, and they're all fat and got all this amazing stuff in them. And you're supposed to know what it all is. And I have no idea.

00:26:17
nexxeln: @dmdboi x _ _ o _ _ _ _ x

00:26:18
<transcript>: But it's kind of cool because there's so much functionality in these starter projects, like, the amount of I'm going to show you guys, actually, I'm going to show you guys. Hang on. I'm going to show you right now.

00:26:18
<transcript>: if i get my foot

00:26:20
<transcript>: If I get my foot pedal over here.

00:26:20
<transcript>: let's just

00:26:23
<transcript>: Let's just show you you just need to see.

00:26:35
<transcript>: You need to see the laravel. Look at this stuff. This is the starter project, okay? It has all this functionality. It has teams. You can create teams. Oh, I got to log in.

00:26:38
<transcript>: What did I do? I don't know what I use.

00:26:46
<transcript>: So it's got like team you can invite team members.

00:26:46
<transcript>: right and then

00:26:46
mehulsharmamat: okay quick q @adamdotdev have you ever used ruby on rails?

00:26:50
thdxr: they probably did teams wrong

00:26:58
thdxr: no one does it right

00:27:01
<transcript>: Right. And then it's got your profile page. I just built this at status and my mind is way worse so you can log out other sessions, delete the account. It's got two factor. It's just all built in. This is just the standard jet stream starter project. Are you kidding me.

00:27:05
<transcript>: Like most of my side projects, never get this far.

00:27:07
dmdboi: Im writing all this down for my adonis addons LUL

00:27:09
<transcript>: You can just like cli create this, but look at all the files.

00:27:09
<transcript>: look at

00:27:11
<transcript>: Look at all this stuff.

00:27:12
nexxeln: clerk says they do it right

00:27:19
<transcript>: This is a starter project, and you've just got all this code that you're now responsible for, which is a little overwhelming.

00:27:21
<transcript>: But.

00:27:21
<transcript>: it's better

00:27:21
thdxr: adonis is good too

00:27:25
mehulsharmamat: yeah MVC arch for other frameworks is rly good

00:27:25
<transcript>: It's better than not having this functionality, I guess. Right. And you know.

00:27:25
<transcript>: all the

00:27:28
mehulsharmamat: RoR is rly good as well

00:27:28
oskrm: Starter project is a full legacy project LUL

00:27:30
thdxr: clerk doesn’t do it right either

00:27:33
<transcript>: All the projects are going to be oh, jeez, I'm not even laid out correctly, you know that all these projects are going to lay out the same.

00:27:42
<transcript>: You're going to come into another layer of L app, and it's going to all be laid out similarly, because you all start with a ton of code. How do I get my layout to work? Here we go.

00:27:46
<transcript>: No, it's not what I wanted to do. No.

00:27:50
dmdboi: @thdxr why are you being nice today

00:27:53
<transcript>: Okay. Well, that was larryville Jet Stream I showed you. Now let's go back over here.

00:27:56
<transcript>: Don't need that.

00:27:56
<transcript>: okay

00:28:00
<transcript>: Okay. Why am I being nice today? Am I being nice.

00:28:00
<transcript>: wait who

00:28:05
<transcript>: Wait. Who's being nice? Are you talking about dax? Probably dax. I'm always nice, right.

00:28:08
<transcript>: Okay.

00:28:08
<transcript>: i'm so far behind

00:28:08
nexxeln: dax

00:28:12
freedomdao: ur always nice

00:28:13
<transcript>: I'm so far behind. Let's start a game of knots and crosses. What is that two dorks is here.

00:28:23
<transcript>: use

00:28:30
mehulsharmamat: that's the only specialization if i got any, and i also suck at that

00:28:30
<transcript>: Uses puppeteer to give gpt vision. It's what the new gpt Four web browser is based on. Oh, interesting. Okay.

00:28:30
<transcript>: i'm going to open that

00:28:32
<transcript>: I'm going to open that up over here.

00:28:36
<transcript>: We'll open that right here.

00:28:43
<transcript>: What are you guys doing with the x's 10:00 a.m.. Okay, 10:00 A.m.. So in, like an hour. Cool.

00:28:53
oskrm: Posture check (+ plz create a command)

00:28:53
freedomdao: soo excited yall are going to start dev plugins !! Yay, the Calvary is here

00:28:55
fideloper: WEW

00:29:03

00:29:03
<transcript>: What are you guys talking about? Nah, dude, new hair is fire. Oh, thanks, new dm. I'm sorry I ruined it with a hat. Thank you for the follows. People are following me. Who followed me?

<transcript>: 's cool. I just joined. I'm not wondering what's going on with it. I'm digging it. Oh, you guys are just loving the hair. Okay, I think Adam looks great with the new hair. Well, you know what? I apologize. I ruined it all with a hat. And it's not coming back today.

00:29:17
<transcript>: but

00:29:27
freedomdao: a huge, huge . huge factoid about chatgpt plugins. one plugin CAN USE ANOTHER PLUGIN! so ur plugin can work with mine and vice versa. if we are l33t about it

00:29:29
<transcript>: But we'll work on it tomorrow. I'll make it even better. Elite Rose, welcome to Chat. New hair looks good. Okay, we've established the hair actually looks good. Okay, I'll stick with it. He looks like the guitarist and a rock.

00:29:30
bishopdev: ahahahahahahaha

00:29:36
<transcript>: Check out my cool database hat. I mean, this is cool, too, right? It's not my cool hair, but it's something.

00:29:40
vedovelli74: Heyo!!

00:29:41
mehulsharmamat: @freedomdao woah thats incredible

00:29:42
<transcript>: You guys are playing some kind of game, and I don't understand it at all. With the x's and the O's.

00:29:42
<transcript>: okay

00:29:56
<transcript>: Okay, quick queue. Have you ever used ruby on rails? I have. Mayhew I definitely have used some ruby on rails. Probably did Teams wrong. No one does it right, bummer. I'm writing all this down for my adonis. Add ons clerk says they do it right.

00:29:56
<transcript>: adon

00:30:01
noob_cod3r: have you used rust or go?

00:30:01
warrenbuffering: Adam PHP Stan now confirmed?

00:30:03
<transcript>: Adonis is good, too. Clerk says they do teams, right? Laravel? Is that what you're saying? Next.

00:30:13
<transcript>: Is Adonis good. I've never used it. How do we have a good thing in javascript and no one uses it or do people use it? No one talks about it.

00:30:20
<transcript>: Okay, let's get this laid out.

00:30:21
dmdboi: Adonis doesnt have VC marketing money LUL

00:30:22
charafmrah: and have you used any Python based web frameworks?

00:30:22
naxodev: my twitch is acting today

00:30:24
<transcript>: Get it all tidied up like we know what we're doing.

00:30:27
warrenbuffering: I'm here for it

00:30:30
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah. That's good. What is this? I don't need that.

00:30:35
<transcript>: Starter project is full.

00:30:35
<transcript>: is a full leg

00:30:39
freedomdao: @mehulsharmamat so my friend made one 2 days ago. one plugin programs code, another plugin checks the code with real local execution, gives output back to the 2nd plugin. then the bot "learns" programming. and it does.

00:30:45
<transcript>: Is a full legacy project. Yeah. It's like you're coming into a whole established code base. Nvc architecture. Good for other frameworks is really good. Rebound rails is really good as well.

00:30:49
<transcript>: My only knock. I said it a minute ago. Posture check.

00:30:49
<transcript>: ooh

00:30:50
frectonz: So you're telling me Laravel is good. Saw the vid on twitter 😂

00:30:54
<transcript>: Ooh, good call, molly. Knock on ruby on rails is.

00:30:58
<transcript>: The Deployment picture.

00:31:00
mehulsharmamat: @freedomdao ..woah

00:31:00
unrulyhotfixer: adonis is good. it's a javascript version of laravel but it doesn't have a third of laravel's features

00:31:02
<transcript>: Clerk doesn't do it right, either.

00:31:04
schrew: tech debt built in to the starter app - now we're thinking with portals.

00:31:07
<transcript>: No. You were talking to dax. Why are you even nice today? I love it.

00:31:07
<transcript>: oh

00:31:14
<transcript>: Oh yeah I love me some chat gbt API let's do it. That's the only special agent if I got any and also second that.

00:31:17
<transcript>: They didn't give out gpt four image prompting. And I'm mad.

00:31:17
<transcript>: what do you suck at

00:31:20
<transcript>: What do you suck at? Mayhew you don't suck at something.

00:31:20
<transcript>: what do you

00:31:20
tumtumpkinz: No types in ruby on rails

00:31:21
<transcript>: What do you suck at.

00:31:21
<transcript>: cast this thank

00:31:25
<transcript>: Cast this. Thank you for the follow. I appreciate that.

00:31:25
<transcript>: my

00:31:28
<transcript>: My voice is still waking up.

00:31:28
<transcript>: in my

00:31:33
<transcript>: In my brain. I'm having caffeine. There's some caffeine in this. Feels good.

00:31:42
<transcript>: So excited you all are going to start Dev plugins the cavalry is here.

00:31:55
mehulsharmamat: "you dont suck at anything" literally can not deploy the app for 3 day straight because has no idea about AWS LUL

00:32:02
<transcript>: Laravel. Chris is here. What's going on? Chris, what did Chat say to Adam that made him put on a hat? Vim Surf. They made fun of my hair. No, they actually all said, My hair looks good. And I got self conscious about it. And I put on a hat. Actually, what happened, what really happened is they were like, your hair looks good. It's pointy. And it was. And I was like, yeah, if it were just a little lower, like, it'd be better.

00:32:02
<transcript>: and then

00:32:09
mattmancodes: @tumtumpkinz Ruby has type annotations

00:32:09
<transcript>: And then somebody said something else. And I was like, That's it I'm going back to the original, and I shoved it down. And it was worse. It was way worse.

00:32:09
<transcript>: the hair

00:32:19
<transcript>: The hair wants to be up. It dried that way. But I tried pushing it down, and then it was just kind of like, out and down. It was bad. So then the hat came on.

00:32:20
<transcript>: Huge.

00:32:20
<transcript>: factory about

00:32:36
<transcript>: Factory about Chad gbd plugins. One plugin can use another plugin so your plugin can work with mine and vice versa if we're elite about it. Whoa. A chain of plugins talking to each other. Hey, O, vito, what's going on.

00:32:39
<transcript>: Have you used rust or go? Yes.

00:32:39
<transcript>: well

00:32:45
<transcript>: Well, I've used Go a lot more than rust. I've played with rust and the rest book.

00:32:48
nexxeln: plugins are first class values

00:32:48
<transcript>: I've baby steps into rest. I've not done anything.

00:32:54
noob_cod3r: try out langchan

00:32:58
<transcript>: Ask DAX though he's had rest in production forever since it was born. I think Adam PHP stand now confirmed what's going on? Warren.

00:32:58
<transcript>: aden

00:33:06
<transcript>: Adenus doesn't have vc marketing money. Has larvae ever raised money? I don't know if Taylor ever raised money for Laravelle. He's got a Lambo.

00:33:10
<transcript>: Have you used any python based web frameworks.

00:33:10
<transcript>: yeah django

00:33:10
fideloper: nope, no raised money

00:33:11
<transcript>: Yeah? Django.

00:33:11
<transcript>: i worked

00:33:14
fideloper: all bootstrapped

00:33:17
<transcript>: I worked at a django shop for like a year. My twitch is acting today. It's acting.

00:33:17
<transcript>: acting

00:33:19
<transcript>: Acting up.

00:33:19
<transcript>: so

00:33:24
noob_cod3r: so should i migrate my nodejs package to rust or go?

00:33:30
<transcript>: So you're telling me laravel is good, solid on Twitter? Yes, fractons. Welcome to Chat, laravel. I mean, I've spent, like, an hour with it, but the first hour blew me away.

00:33:39
charafmrah: is there a reason you don't use Django much anymore?

00:33:46
<transcript>: I'm here for it. Okay, so my friend made one, two days ago. One plugin programs code. Another plugin checks the code with real code. Execution gives output back to the second plugin. Then the bot learns programming. Whoa. What do we do when the bots learn programming.

00:33:56
<transcript>: Okay. Adonis is good. It's a javascript version of laravel, but it doesn't have a third of laravel's features.

00:33:56
<transcript>: tech

00:34:00
<transcript>: Tech debt built into the starter app. Now we're thinking, with portals.

00:34:05
noob_cod3r: backend not package sorry

00:34:05
<transcript>: No tights and rhubarb and rails also true. Thank you for the follow.

00:34:26
<transcript>: Oxack. Oh, it's like zack, but it's like in hexadecimal. Maybe you don't suck at anything. Literally cannot deploy the app for three days straight because he has no idea about Ad best. Well, you just haven't learned stuff about aws yet. It doesn't mean you suck at it. I think in order to say you suck at something, you have to have done it a lot and still be bad at it if you're new to.

00:34:26
<transcript>: something

00:34:27
enjoytolive: Hello 👋

00:34:32
<transcript>: Something. Everyone sucks when you're new, so nobody sucks. You know what I mean? Like, you're just learning it.

00:34:35
mehulsharmamat: that is true

00:34:35
dmdboi: 34 minutes and not a line of code written, this is a proper dev stream

00:34:36
<transcript>: Ruby has type annotations. Kind of like Python.

00:34:36
<transcript>: plugins

00:34:38
thdxr: not me

00:34:39
<transcript>: Plugins are first class values.

00:34:39
<transcript>: try out

00:34:44
thdxr: i’m good at stuff right away

00:34:47
thdxr: sorry everyone

00:34:48
<transcript>: Try out link chain. Oh, there's lang chain, too. No. Raised money. That's awesome. All bootstrapped. Good for Taylor. So should I migrate my node js package to rust or go.

00:34:49
mehulsharmamat: brb exposing myself directly to aws and aging at 3x speed

00:34:51
kisancodes: HeyGuys

00:34:51
<transcript>: Your node Jazz package to rust or go.

00:34:56
<transcript>: Oh, you're back in. I'm not going that far.

00:34:56
<transcript>: there's

00:35:00
<transcript>: There's a lot of context involved in a decision like that.

00:35:00
<transcript>: not saying

00:35:04
dmdboi: @thdxr Classic Junior Dev

00:35:10
<transcript>: Not saying you should just change technologies. I'm just saying, like we put up with a lot of nonsense in the javascript community. Like javascript on the back end is kind of a toxic place to be.

00:35:10
<transcript>: regardless

00:35:12
<transcript>: Regardless of the technology.

00:35:12
<transcript>: it's just kind of

00:35:15
mattmancodes: LUL

00:35:17
schrew: D:

00:35:26
thdxr: i’m gonna fix javascript

00:35:27
noob_cod3r: because of js backend is ruined kinda

00:35:30
thdxr: dw

00:35:32
<transcript>: It's just kind of annoying. The community is annoying. The pretentiousness of the companies at the top that have raised hundreds of millions of dollars is annoying. There's just a lot of things that are annoying about it. And it's funny to think that there's this place called laravel that's like paradise, and it's isolated from all of it. And we just all don't talk about it and we ignore it. It's so dumb.

00:35:36
<transcript>: Hello, enjoy. To live. Welcome to chat.

00:35:36
<transcript>: thirty four minutes

00:35:37
freedomdao: i like Laravel too

00:35:43
kasvith: Javascript at anywhere is annoying..specially in FE with React

00:35:45
<transcript>: 34 minutes and not a line of code written. This is a proper Dev stream. Yes, that's it. Diamond. This is how we do it over here, not me. I'm good at stuff right away. Sorry, everyone.

00:35:45
<transcript>: beer back

00:35:46
mattmancodes: at least we have the frontend cloud now

00:35:51
<transcript>: Beer back, exposing myself directly to aws and aging it three times. Feet. What's up, kissan.

00:35:51
<transcript>: okay

00:35:52
<transcript>: Okay.

00:35:52
<transcript>: let's do some stuff

00:35:54
naxodev: Laravel is the best framework in the world, the downside is PHP lol

00:35:55
kisancodes: LUL

00:35:57
oskrm: Is it 6am?

00:36:00
<transcript>: Let's do some stuff. I want to tell you what I'm going to build. I'm going to fix javascript. Yeah. Please do dax, do that thing and fix it. Because that would be great.

00:36:03
<transcript>: Okay, I'm actually caught up now.

00:36:03
<transcript>: welcome

00:36:06
dnbull: Hi Adam

00:36:12
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Cast. This JavaScript at anywhere is annoying, especially in front end with React. I agree. At least we have the front end cloud now at least.

00:36:13
kisancodes: Let's all get back to php

00:36:15
<transcript>: Im market.

00:36:15
<transcript>: thank you for that

00:36:22
nexxeln: adam you just need to move to the vue community

00:36:24
nexxeln: very nice so far

00:36:26
<transcript>: Thank you for that. Follow. Thank you so much. Yeah, we have the front end cloud. Now, apparently, there's more than one vendor that's building the front end cloud. I heard that there's someone else building the front end cloud.

00:36:30
<transcript>: Laravel is the best framework in the world. The downside is PHP.

00:36:30
<transcript>: is it six

00:36:32
nexxeln: use the antfu stack

00:36:35
<transcript>: Is it 06:00 a.m. Oscar no, it is almost 08:00 a.m. For me.

00:36:38
<transcript>: 08:00 a.m.

00:36:39
kasvith: Try Pheonix

00:36:45
<transcript>: It's exactly 08:00 a.m. Actually hey Dmbo. What's going on? How's Miami? Let's all get back to PHP.

00:36:45
<transcript>: okay

00:36:46
mattmancodes: oh no, not multi-frontend clouds.

00:36:48
<transcript>: Okay, move to the View community. Interesting.

00:36:50
noob_cod3r: 6:30 pm here in india

00:36:58
<transcript>: I made that don't use React video or I'm leaving React. And a lot of people were like, you should join the View community.

00:36:58
<transcript>: i guess

00:37:04
<transcript>: I guess a lot of people use laravel in view. That's the thing. I don't know. I've done some view.

00:37:04
<transcript>: and some of the

00:37:08
<transcript>: And some of the string stuff in the tags. I don't know. Some of it was weird to me.

00:37:19
l33t_rose: have you tried out Svelte?

00:37:21
<transcript>: But I'm not totally close minded, and I'm sure the community is better than the React community. I mean, there's that try Phoenix. Oh, I've done some Phoenix castmith. Have I done some Phoenix? You missed.

00:37:21
<transcript>: some

00:37:24
<transcript>: Some Phoenix.

00:37:24
<transcript>: like

00:37:29
<transcript>: Like more Phoenix than I'd ever like to do again.

00:37:29
<transcript>: all this

00:37:35
<transcript>: All this Phoenix. We've been doing some Phoenix around here. Okay, this is a Phoenix stream.

00:37:35
<transcript>: we're moving

00:37:39
<transcript>: We're moving away from Phoenix because none of us know elixir.

00:37:40
charafmrah: I mean is PHP really worse than JavaScript?

00:37:41
thdxr: adam is just copying my laravel angle

00:37:44
thdxr: get your own thing

00:37:47
<transcript>: There's a lot of files in this. I don't know why I'm just opening folders to show you how many files there are. Okay, let's make a new tmux.

00:37:47
<transcript>: we're going to call

00:37:49
<transcript>: We're going to call it.

00:37:52
<transcript>: Gpt.

00:37:54
enjoytolive: Svelte is so far imo the best front end framework and laravel is the best backed framework

00:37:55
<transcript>: Now I'm going to call it food.

00:37:55
<transcript>: it'll make sense

00:37:55
mehulsharmamat: vue is nice. one thing ive learned is big react codebases default to chaotic code until written nicely, vue generally does not.

00:37:56
kasvith: haha...its cool to know...im new

00:37:57
<transcript>: It'll make sense in a second.

00:38:00
<transcript>: Okay, food.

00:38:15
<transcript>: Maybe foodie. Foodie would have been a little more like I'm trying to make a startup, but that's okay. We'll go with food. So what am I going to do? I want to make okay. So here's the thing. My wife has wanted something from me.

00:38:15
<transcript>: for some time

00:38:16
<transcript>: For some time.

00:38:18
kasvith: i was interested the stream when you say bye to React LOL

00:38:19
oskrm: @mehulsharmamat u tried svelte?

00:38:20
freedomdao: if anyone needs to get plugin access you can sign up here but only certain countries https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins

00:38:27
dmdboi: Drinking game; take a shot every time he says "my wife"

00:38:28
<transcript>: And through the course of our almost 15 years of marriage at various points, she has wanted me to build something because I'm a developer. It's what I do. And sometimes she's like, hey, I have needs.

00:38:36
nexxeln: LUL

00:38:37
mehulsharmamat: @mehulsharmamat not yet. still want to tho

00:38:41
bishopdev: not sure what we're talking about here adam ..

00:38:43
<transcript>: There are things that would be nice if they existed. And if you could build them for me, that would be fantastic. And you know how hard it is to make time for that kind of stuff. Apparently really hard, because I never do it. I feel like a terrible husband.

00:38:43
<transcript>: it's just hard

00:38:45
<transcript>: It's just hard. We got kids.

00:38:45
<transcript>: we got

00:38:46
thdxr: my wife just wants me to shut up about cold starts

00:38:46
schrew: I'm already excited for when adam's wife is going to make fun of him

00:38:49
<transcript>: We got stuff to do I got work to do.

00:38:49
<transcript>: but anyway

00:38:50
unrulyhotfixer: vue became popular because it of laravel so i think that is part of the reason why a lot of people use them together.

00:38:50
<transcript>: But anyway.

00:38:58
schrew: @thdxr I died at that tweet

00:39:01
<transcript>: She wants something, and I'm going to actually make it for her this time. I'm actually doing it. And becky done this week for Mother's Day. That'd be cool. Sunday's. Mother's day.

00:39:04
warrenbuffering: You can learn how to code on my stream honey

00:39:07
<transcript>: Didn't even put that together. I'm just copying your laravel angle. What is that? Dax.

00:39:07
<transcript>: i have not

00:39:08
funkysetiz: are you going to use chatGPT api to do something about cooking?

00:39:13
nexxeln: same @Schrew

00:39:17
mehulsharmamat: @mehulsharmamat for me my own projects are pretty similar so they dont get too complicated. but otherwise for HUGE projects vue > react until devs know what theyre doing

00:39:22
<transcript>: I have not tried out spelt Leetros. I should try out spelt too. I just need to do a tour of all the things now that I'm like a free agent, I'm like a technology free agent. I'm not just going to commit to larryville right off the bat. I got to try out some of this other stuff I will say on the laravel side.

00:39:26
<transcript>: The inertia angle. I'm not sure I want to go back to that.

00:39:26
<transcript>: when i saw

00:39:35
barely_usable: i mean laravel has lambos

00:39:37
<transcript>: When I saw it kind of go the live wire path or go the inertia path. It's like, if you go inertia, you can use next. Js. It's like, no, that's where I'm trying to escape. I'm trying to get away from xjs. I don't want to go back there.

00:39:46
thdxr: @adamdotdev i said all this laravel stuff a month ago and had aaron on my stream for two hours lmao

00:39:50
<transcript>: So there's that angle. Like I'm not sure why I would just switch to riding my back end and php. That's not the draw to me. The draw is to escape full stack javascript wholesale like full stop.

00:39:50
kasvith: Inertia can be used with Vue :)

00:39:55
<transcript>: 06:30 P.m. In India. Welcome from India. Noob.

00:39:59
<transcript>: Is php really worse than javascript? But I don't think so.

00:40:00
oskrm: @mehulsharmamat when I tried Vue I lost React's value. Svelte made me switch from all those

00:40:00
thdxr: where do you think you got the idea?

00:40:03
thdxr: it’s ALWAYS ME

00:40:13
<transcript>: What is your larvae angle? Dax Felt is so far in my opinion the best front end framework and laravel is the best back framework. View is nice. One thing I've learned is big rack code bases, default to catac code until written nicely. View generally does not okay.

00:40:17
<transcript>: Interested the stream when you say buy to react.

00:40:25
charafmrah: if that's your goal then I really think Spring Boot is a viable option

00:40:26
<transcript>: Yeah, I did say by the React. If anyone needs to get plugin access, you can sign up here only certain countries. Okay, I got to scroll. Are you going to use Shad.

00:40:26
<transcript>: to do something

00:40:30
<transcript>: To do something about cooking. Yes, funky. I am.

00:40:32
naxodev: PHP is weirdly similar to Javascript,

00:40:33
<transcript>: I'll tell you more in just a second.

00:40:33
<transcript>: i'm

00:40:38
<transcript>: I'm already excited for when adam's wife is going to make fun of him. It's true.

00:40:38
<transcript>: it'll happen

00:40:42
charafmrah: lets all just switch to WordPress and call it a day

00:40:43
<transcript>: It'll happen today you just won't be around take a shot every time is my wife.

00:40:49
mehulsharmamat: @charafmrah 10000000000%

00:40:49
faffinaboot: PHP? why not python? Kappa

00:40:54
warrenbuffering: Code and food, it's lit fam

00:40:56
funkysetiz: I did something with chatgpt3 api. want to check it?

00:40:58
<transcript>: My wife just wants me to shut up about cold starts. I saw that Dick such a good tweet. Wow, I'm already excited for when okay. Saw that view became popular because of the Laravo. So I think that is part of the reason why a lot of people use them together.

00:41:02
<transcript>: Okay, you can learn how to code on my stream. Honey.

00:41:06
freedomdao: @funkysetiz yea def

00:41:12
statsndata: Good Morning chat!

00:41:14
weavdale: Laravel's commercial products are made with Inertia and Vue.

00:41:17
oskrm: Is your wife even subbed?

00:41:18
faffinaboot: But full stack JS, what are you thinking?

00:41:22
<transcript>: That's funny. You're going to need a chat. Do you API to do something about cooking? Yes. For me, my own projects are pretty similar, so they don't. Why am I reading all the chat? I should just stop. I said all this laravel stuff a month ago and had erin on my stream for 2 hours. You did have Aaron on your stream. I've talked about Larry Bell for a long time. I've just never actually taken any action. Okay. So we're not sure that you didn't.

00:41:22
<transcript>: copy

00:41:25
<transcript>: Copy. Me. Dax. We're not positive.

00:41:32
<transcript>: Where do you think you got the idea? It's always Me. It's always DAX.

00:41:32
<transcript>: inertia

00:41:35
<transcript>: Inertia can be used with view okay.

00:41:42
<transcript>: That's a goal. I really think Springboot is vibe often. Php is where the summer JavaScript WordPress and call today. Okay.

00:41:42
<transcript>: welcome to

00:41:49
thdxr: i invented laravel

00:41:59

funkysetiz: @freedomdao it's still a bit a work in progress but it's cool

00:42:15
<transcript>: Code and food. It's lit fam. I did something with Chad gb three api. Want to check it first? Funky. I need to get on track here before I check your stuff. I got to make my stuff. Good morning. Stats and data. Larryville's commercial products are made with inertia view is your wife.

00:42:19
<transcript>: Is your wife even subbed? No, she doesn't even watch my streams.

00:42:23
faffinaboot: Howdy, and yes! Lol. *What are you thinking of using?

00:42:31
<transcript>: You invented laravel. Did you really? Oh, it's a new account. Oh, two underscore. What are you doing? Get push. Why'd you make a new account? That's funny. Okay, so here's what my wife wants.

00:42:31

gitpush__gitpaid: did you not see the chat Kappa

00:42:44
faffinaboot: Howdy gitpush kiyeFarm

00:42:45
<transcript>: Open minded, hip people. Okay? Do not take this all as like my wife is the she's the cooker in the family. And I just do the work.

00:42:50
grognosh2: CoolCat

00:42:50
thdxr: adam doesn’t read DMs

00:42:52
mehulsharmamat: @funkysetiz aaaah i use the thing to do the thing

00:42:55
<transcript>: And read the newspaper when I get off. We're not that couple. Okay, but she is really into nutrition. Like really into it. Super into it.

00:42:58
dmdboi: Help, my liver can't take anymore

00:43:01
<transcript>: She really cares about what we put in our bodies and all the food that we consume.

00:43:03
<transcript>: And so therefore.

00:43:03
<transcript>: she does take

00:43:07
thdxr: adam is trying to replace his wife with chatgpt

00:43:10
gitpush__gitpaid: i changed my other username without knowing that my previous username would be locked for 6+ months... hard lesson learned

00:43:18
funkysetiz: @funkysetiz whaat? :D

00:43:23
<transcript>: She does take a lot of the responsibility for the food that we eat, including preparing it. We're trying to hire a personal chef. She doesn't really want to do the executing. She just wants to do the planning and high level direction. She wants to be the CEO of our kitchen, not the Cook. So we're trying to hire a personal chef. It's just hard in the ozarks to find good people, not.

00:43:23
<transcript>: good people

00:43:23
freedomdao: chatgpt + wolfram can calculate nutrition and calories !! so maybe a wolfram + your foodie plugin :D

00:43:26
<transcript>: Good people. I mean, it's hard to find people.

00:43:26
<transcript>: that

00:43:27
sockthedev: hey chat, what we doing? oh, chatting about adams wife again

00:43:35
<transcript>: That will want to do that kind of work for you every day. Anyway, I don't know how I got into that, but we spend so much time every week. So much time.

00:43:35
<transcript>: consume

00:43:37
<transcript>: Consumed.

00:43:37
<transcript>: with

00:43:38
dmdboi: No "good people" live in the Ozarks, noted

00:43:44
warrenbuffering: Is that like 3 meals a day?

00:43:52
levidayne: Vegan private chef in the ozarks would be quite the job

00:43:54
<transcript>: With what we're going to make that week, like recipes, just literally. What are we going to eat this week? What will the boys eat? And what do we need to get at the store and then planning out the trip to the store? And if we take the boys, it's a nightmare. And we had to be so efficient, because it just takes so long in the store.

00:43:54
<transcript>: it's just like

00:43:59
<transcript>: It's just like it's a huge burden. And what we'd like to have is.

00:44:04
vimcerf: @LeviDayne it would

00:44:06
<transcript>: We'd like to basically digitize all of our recipes. We have this huge binder full of recipes that she likes to make. And we like to eat.

00:44:06
<transcript>: we

00:44:07
bishopdev: OMG, we do that constantly ... it's like you're living my life ( the food and the kids )

00:44:23
<transcript>: We'd like to digitize all those and then just have it choose meals for us every week and just not have to think about it. And then also just spit out an optimized shopping list that's based on how our store is laid out so that we can it groups all the produce it groups all the frozen stuff. It groups all the you know what I'm saying.

00:44:23
<transcript>: we want to just

00:44:27
codingrob: A personal chef sounds nice.. currently I mostly buy pre-prep meals (varied/frozen) because I/we hate cooking.

00:44:28
<transcript>: We want to just automate as much of the weekly toil that we go through every single week.

00:44:29
statsndata: *crosses Ozark off vacation list* reason: Adam said no good people

00:44:30
thdxr: can’t wait till adam dies before me because he’s vegan

00:44:30
bishopdev: add to that my kids being SOOO picky with food

00:44:31
freedomdao: Very nice!

00:44:34
<transcript>: That's basically what we're getting at. And I think Chat gbd can help adam's trying to replace his wife with JBC.

00:44:34
thdxr: will dance on his grave

00:44:41
freedomdao: chatgpt can def do this

00:44:43

mattmancodes: We get 3 meals delivered to us each week. Biggest cause of arguments in our relationship. A personal chef would no doubt blow up in my face too.

00:45:25
<transcript>: Adam doesn't read dms. Yeah, I don't read dms. Who sent me a dm, though? I use the thing to do the thing. What are you guys talking about.

<transcript>: They already have an Instacart plugin. And that's what gets me excited because we do buy a lot of stuff on Instacart.

00:45:56
<transcript>: Ketcho, thank you for the follow.

00:45:56
<transcript>: so we do

00:45:57
<transcript>: So we do.

00:45:59
noob_cod3r: use langchain here

00:46:00
<transcript>: A lot of Instacart.

00:46:00
<transcript>: okay

00:46:02
<transcript>: Okay.

00:46:02
<transcript>: if our

00:46:02
thdxr: adam it’s going to be time to record by the time you start

00:46:03
freedomdao: ah yeah , instacart plugin. automatic ordering

00:46:04
gitpush__gitpaid: wait how do you have plugins

00:46:06
<transcript>: If our plugin could just be responsible for shopping list.

00:46:06
<transcript>: and

00:46:09
<transcript>: And choosing five of our recipes every week.

00:46:16
<transcript>: And maybe it could become aware of what we still have leftover ingredients wise, and it could be a little more like.

00:46:16
<transcript>: there's some

00:46:18
oskrm: @gitpush__gitpaid Fame

00:46:20
<transcript>: There's some science, like choosing meals that kind of have similar ingredients.

00:46:20
<transcript>: in the week

00:46:24
<transcript>: In the week so that you're kind of like not letting stuff go bad.

00:46:24
<transcript>: if every meal has

00:46:25
<transcript>: If every meal has.

00:46:25
<transcript>: completely distinct

00:46:37
<transcript>: Completely distinct sets of ingredients. It's annoying because then you have to get all these different groceries, and then some of it just goes bad. And it's annoying. So if it could choose meals that kind of have some overlap, that's nice, too.

00:46:37
gitpush__gitpaid: @gitpush__gitpaid ok but that doesnt explain why adam has access to the plugins

00:46:52
<transcript>: But if it could just order everything it can on instacart, it just shows up. How awesome would that be like now we're cooking. Now we're talking and we just got hire a personal chef to do all the prep and life is good. We don't think about food anymore.

00:46:52
<transcript>: what

00:47:01
<transcript>: What are we doing? Sock chatting about anne's wife again? Yeah, no. Good people live in the ozark. No, it's not true. Diamond. That's not what I meant. I'm so sorry. I take it all back. It's not what I meant.

00:47:06
<transcript>: What did I miss? You guys talked a lot, and now I'm so behind.

00:47:08
<transcript>: Okay.

00:47:08
<transcript>: is that like three meals a

00:47:08
warrenbuffering: Meal planning GPT has legs already. "We need to figure out what we're gonna eat this week" my wife too

00:47:26
<transcript>: Is that like three meals a meal today? Yeah, three meals a day. Warren. That's right. Vegan private chef in the ozarks would be quite the job. Yeah, well, they're not going to be a vegan chef. Although we did have someone that brought us meals for a good year while we were building this house, someone who is a vegan chef. They have a vegan bakery in Springfield.

00:47:28
faffinaboot: Any chance a local resteraunt could do the meal prep every few days, like a local hello fresh.

00:47:32
freedomdao: with a cron script you can do that. once a week. cron job to prompt chatGPT to order/collect information on your food. even could use an OCR video camera in the fridge. see the contents.

00:47:35
<transcript>: She was amazing. But she was never going to come live in our house or come to our house every day and prepare meals because she has this business.

00:47:35
<transcript>: but

00:47:41
<transcript>: But she did deliver meals twice a week. She would bring like two days worth of meals twice a week.

00:47:55
<transcript>: We did it for a year. It was amazing, but we really want somebody who will come into our home, do all the prep, clean up, all of it, even just buy the groceries. If we need somebody to go to the store and get something, we just want somebody who'll do all the food. We're going to outsource food, all of it.

00:48:05
<transcript>: We do that constantly. It's like you're living my life, the food and the kids. Yeah, Bishop, it's just so much of our mind. And our energy goes into keeping everybody fed.

00:48:05
<transcript>: and clean

00:48:05
mehulsharmamat: okay i completely forgot someone in chat was helping me with somethin SQS, can i find that person here?

00:48:11
oskrm: I like the "Defining Serverless video" idea KEKW

00:48:14
<transcript>: And cleaned up. Personal Chef says Lives. Currently, I mostly buy prep meals because we hate cooking. Yeah, coding. I hear you. Rob.

00:48:19
<transcript>: Crosses those arc on vacation list reason Adam said no good people.

00:48:29
<transcript>: Can't wait till Adam dies before me because he's vegan. Oh, my word, dax. Add to that. My kids being so picky. Same here, Bishop. It's so annoying. But I love them, dearly. They're the best.

00:48:29
<transcript>: but

00:48:33
<transcript>: But they won't eat anything and it drives me nuts.

00:48:33
<transcript>: on

00:48:35
<transcript>: On his grave.

00:48:35
<transcript>: chad

00:48:40
<transcript>: Chad dvd can definitely do this. What's the touchpad you use? Oh, this is just an Apple trackpad.

00:48:42
<transcript>: Wife GPT.

00:48:43
gitpush__gitpaid: bro how do you need a chef and youre vegan? go wash some broccoli and call it a day

00:48:50
<transcript>: I am Marcus. Welcome to Chat. Over half of my mental energy is spent on meal planning and having and finding stuff our kids will eat. Haven't found a great solution.

00:48:50
daglee: @adamdotdev I got dax the other day, it was glorious.

00:48:51
dmmulroy: Do y'all eat a lot of vegan indian food?

00:48:51
dmdboi: @gitpush__gitpaid Plenty of grass outside

00:48:57
<transcript>: I read your dm grasp. I do read them sometimes.

00:49:03
<transcript>: I'm more likely to read A. Dm if I see the first line, it's just like, Hey.

00:49:03
<transcript>: it's me

00:49:11
<transcript>: It's me. How are you? That's an easy one. If I think it's a dm that's going to take something of me like I have to take action on it. Then I leave it on.

00:49:11
<transcript>: unread

00:49:15
<transcript>: Unread so that I don't forget and I just never read it.

00:49:15
<transcript>: basically how

00:49:22
<transcript>: Basically how that works. My grocery shop let you order online and just pick up the grocery bags from a fridge locked outside. Okay.

00:49:36
<transcript>: Yeah, we've got delivery stuff now they'll bring stuff to us. James Debt, thank you so much for the prime sub. Prime sub. What is today? Tuesday. I think tuesdays are the best days to get prime subs. Pretty sure.

00:49:36
<transcript>: my grocery

00:49:56
<transcript>: My grocery shop. Let's see. Get in touch with Boston and amoson Bed chat gpd into your wife. Oh, my word. That sounds terrible. Terra wat. Terrible terawatt. We get three meals delivered us each week. Biggest cause of arguments in our relationship. A personal chef would no doubt blow up in my base, too. Nft scam. Hey, did you read my dms? Reggie dev. Adam reads all my dms? Have you ever sent me one.

00:49:56
<transcript>: reggie

00:50:01
<transcript>: Reggie nft. Scam. Did you send me A. Dm? Are you guys just messing with me.

00:50:01
<transcript>: m ray the developer

00:50:04
<transcript>: M. Ray, the developer. Welcome to chat.

00:50:04
<transcript>: use la

00:50:15
<transcript>: Use lang chain. Adam, it's going to be time to record by the time you start. Yeah, I know. I may not actually do anything on stream. Instagram plugin, automatic ordering. How do I have plugins? Because I got access.

00:50:15
<transcript>: kind of

00:50:18
<transcript>: Kind of important. I got access to it.

00:50:29
<transcript>: What are we talking about on our podcast today? Dax doesn't explain why Adam has x's plugins meal planning. Gpt has legs already. We need to figure out what we're going to eat this week. So here's the thing.

00:50:32
<transcript>: Here's what's my original plan? My original plan was.

00:50:38
<transcript>: I'm going to use because we have all these recipes in a book.

00:50:38
<transcript>: they're all

00:50:38
l33t_rose: !podcast

00:50:38
fossabot: Adam has a podcast with Dax Raad (@thdxr) where they talk about the future of everything: https://tomorrow.fm

00:50:42
<transcript>: They're all from various sources, but she's like printed out stuff.

00:50:42
<transcript>: like

00:50:52
<transcript>: Like photocopied. Some of them gotten some off the internet. We just have this random hodgepodge of recipes, what I was going to do and this works. Actually. Let me show you this.

00:50:59
<transcript>: So I have to make a recipe schema, so recipe schema.

00:51:07
<transcript>: I don't have one. Just right off the top. Okay. Here we go. Can you just give me, like an example? Javascript object.

00:51:07
<transcript>: please

00:51:08
<transcript>: Please.

00:51:12
<transcript>: Json. Here we go. Okay.

00:51:23
oskrm: LUL you could've asked chatgpt for it

00:51:32
<transcript>: What is this? Is this it. No. If you handed a schema, I've already done this. If you handed a schema and you say here is like text from OCR. Like if you take a photo on iphone, you can OCR the text. So if we just scan our recipe.

00:51:32
<transcript>: with our

00:51:34
<transcript>: With our phone.

00:51:34
<transcript>: that's a way

00:51:54
<transcript>: That's a way to quickly digitize them. Because you can say here's a schema for a recipe. Fit this OCR data into that schema. It's so good at that there are going to be startups that are built. I'm predicting it. There will be startups that are built off the fact that gbt makes OCR data so much more useful. It's such a hard problem. Like if you OCR a big blob of text trying to context.

00:51:54
<transcript>: contextualize that

00:52:04
freedomdao: yea i agree. GPT + OCRIs nuts. i have a demo in our discord

00:52:04
<transcript>: Contextualize that and put it into a structured format is such a hard thing and it's so easy with Chad dbt. You just like here's a schema, here's a big blob of OCR text.

00:52:10
<transcript>: Give me that object fitting into that schema. And it works. I've done it.

00:52:10
<transcript>: so

00:52:15
freedomdao: The OCR is sooo good. it can see pipes in a ceiling now :D

00:52:24
<transcript>: So that was my idea to digitize them all. And then I store them all in some database. I could put them in airtable or whatever. I have all the recipes. And now I can say, okay, here's how you interact with this database. Here's the schema for the database. Now.

00:52:24
<transcript>: get me

00:52:29
<transcript>: Get me recipes and shopping lists off of that structured data. You know what I'm saying.

00:52:41
<transcript>: Or what if we just did embeddings? What if I just embedded all of the recipes using custom embeddings and I could just have chat gbt go off of that information. We could even.

00:52:41
<transcript>: put like

00:52:42
totole654: I am trying to do something similar for my website

00:52:47
<transcript>: Put like scientific articles on nutrition and stuff in there maybe. I don't know. Am I getting way too far out there.

00:52:57
freedomdao: no that's a great idea. chatgpt LOVEs scientific stuff

00:53:07
<transcript>: Any chance a local restaurant could do the meal prep every few days like a locahola fresh, maybe faffin. Maybe. I don't know. It'd be mama Jeans if anybody would do it. That's our grocery store because they have, like, a deli. And they do meals. They have like a restaurant kind of thing with a Cron script. You can do that once a week. Cron job to prompt job TV to order, collect information on your food, even.

00:53:07
<transcript>: could use an o

00:53:10
<transcript>: Could use an ocr video camera in the fridge.

00:53:10
<transcript>: what

00:53:11
funkysetiz: that's pretty good idea yup

00:53:12
mattmancodes: Skynet starts with a recipe app, apparently

00:53:15
<transcript>: What? That sounds awesome. Firefly. Thank you for that. Follow.

00:53:15
<transcript>: okay i completely

00:53:20
<transcript>: Okay, I completely forgot someone in Chat was helping me with something sqs. Can I find that person here.

00:53:25
<transcript>: Oh, you like the Defining serverless Video idea.

00:53:28
<transcript>: Oh, this is awesome.

00:53:28
<transcript>: yeah

00:53:31
<transcript>: Yeah. You're just seeing all of my previous.

<transcript>: skynet

00:53:54
<transcript>: Skynet starts recipe app apparently.

00:54:05
<transcript>: Great idea, Chad. We love scientific stuff. Okay, do something similar for my website. Ocr is so good it can see pipes in a ceiling. Now what.

00:54:08
<transcript>: I wasn't even talking about.

00:54:08
<transcript>: i wasn't

00:54:11
<transcript>: I wasn't even saying, have it.

00:54:11
<transcript>: do the

00:54:13
faffinaboot: Potluck buffet as a service

00:54:24
<transcript>: Do the OCR in Chad gbt. I was saying I could use an OCR service. Even our phones do OCR. But you're saying I just upload the photo in here into Chat gbt, and it will do the OCR.

00:54:29
<transcript>: Is that what you're telling me? Do you all eat a lot of vegan Indian food? My favorite food in the world is Indian food.

00:54:35
<transcript>: It's. The only reason I like dax is he's Indian. That's it. It's my favorite food.

00:54:35
<transcript>: that's not really

00:54:37
<transcript>: That's not really true.

00:54:37
<transcript>: i mean

00:54:39
thdxr: @warrenbuffering no joke i always wanted this

00:54:39
<transcript>: I mean partly it's partially true.

00:54:41
dmmulroy: lmao

00:54:44
<transcript>: No, I love any of it. My wife is not super into it.

00:54:44
<transcript>: so

00:54:54
<transcript>: So I eat vegan Indian food occasionally, but especially when I travel. If I go to another city, I'm always trying to find the vegan Indian food that I can find because it's my favorite.

00:54:54
thdxr: it’s not true, adam doesn’t like me

00:54:54
freedomdao: Well our OCR Bot uses google's API then chatgpt learns/simulates from that data setup. and over time... it's gotten better. because vector database. (memory)

00:54:57
<transcript>: Okay.

00:54:57
<transcript>: let's do

00:54:58
mehulsharmamat: what indian food do you like @adamdotdev?

00:55:01
thdxr: wow adam’s wife hates indian people

00:55:03
fitzsimons_dev: I used to work at a startup that did that kinda

00:55:07
<transcript>: Let's do stuff. Do we want to do stuff? Do I just want to talk. I have a lot to say right now. Cooking for the neighborhood as a service. I'm making enchiladas tomorrow. Who else wants some pay me. That would be amazing, actually.

00:55:07
<transcript>: potluck

00:55:07
h4msterbo1: whats your favorite indian dish tehn?

00:55:09
<transcript>: Potluck buffet is a service.

00:55:09
<transcript>: okay

00:55:12
sj_se: you should just talk

00:55:12
<transcript>: Okay. Wow. Adam's life hates Indian people.

00:55:23
whatizit: food with actual flavor

00:55:25
warrenbuffering: @thdxr me too, my wife's app idea but she won't watch Adams stream to learn how to code

00:55:28
<transcript>: Our ocr bot uses Google's api, then Chad gbt learn simulates from that data setup, and over time it's gotten better because of vector database. Oh yeah, vector database. Isn't that supposed to be in here.

00:55:30
<transcript>: Do I have access.

00:55:34
<transcript>: Use a vector.

00:55:34
<transcript>: data

00:55:36
freedomdao: this doesn't have vector database yet

00:55:37
thdxr: in nyc you live in a building with 100s of people i figured someone in my building could make another plate

00:55:38
<transcript>: Database to store personal data.

00:55:41
<transcript>: Is that a thing I have access to yet.

00:55:45
<transcript>: Because I remember that being a thing.

00:55:46
<transcript>: No.

00:55:46
<transcript>: that's a thing

00:55:49
<transcript>: That's a thing, isn't it? Do I have it.

00:55:52
<transcript>: Oh, it doesn't have it yet.

00:55:52
<transcript>: okay

00:55:53
freedomdao: you can only get vector database with chatgpt API

00:55:53
<transcript>: Okay.

00:55:53
<transcript>: i should just

00:55:56
<transcript>: I should just talk. Maybe I should SJ.

00:56:00
<transcript>: Ooh, what's my favorite Indian dish? Great question.

00:56:03
faffinaboot: Thdxr no doubt

00:56:03
thdxr: i don’t think you need a vector db for this do you

00:56:08
whatizit: i need this feature

00:56:10
<transcript>: It's tough to say favorite, because I like so many. I mean, chana masala, I'm going to say all these wrong, but that's a favorite. Obviously.

00:56:15
<transcript>: It's the cauliflower and potatoes, what's it called.

00:56:18
thdxr: if you just wanna talk should we record now

00:56:18
<transcript>: No. What's it called.

00:56:22
<transcript>: Cauliflower and potatoes. Somebody. Anybody.

00:56:22
<transcript>: if

00:56:25
freedomdao: we use pinecone.io for our vector db, external service

00:56:29
fitzsimons_dev: The unseen issue with that is that the people who would use this service are on average, fussier about their foods

00:56:34
whatizit: sag aloo

00:56:35
gitpush__gitpaid: you know adam is passionate about a topic if hes switching cameras

00:56:35
<transcript>: If you just want to talk with your cord now, dax, let's just do it. If you're down, let's just do it. I don't think you need a vector DB for this. Oh, no, I don't. I just wanted to see if I could use that now, because it looks really useful to be able to store personal information.

00:56:36
dreadyfire: Pakoras? The fried stuff?

00:56:39
thdxr: adam you probably never had south indian food which is more innately vegetarian

00:56:40
mehulsharmamat: adams list: chana masala cauliflower potatoes? aloo-pattagobhi i guess lol

00:56:42
<transcript>: In New York City, you live in a building with hundreds of people. I figured someone in my building can make another plate. Yes, that should be a thing.

00:56:44
thdxr: send me riverside

00:56:46

00:56:53
h4msterbo1: Bangan Burtha

00:56:55
<transcript>: So good. Send me riverside. Okay, wait. Dax, we can't do it on my stream.

00:56:58
fitzsimons_dev: It's not a thing at all. Won't work

00:57:03
<transcript>: Can we do it on my stream? I don't think we can do it on my stream. I feel like everything on my stream will not work.

00:57:04
noob_cod3r: oh you are looking for hindi names

00:57:06
smartdrevil: Basically sabji

00:57:07
thdxr: ok i’ll go on

00:57:08
<transcript>: Do you think we can do it on my stream? I think we should do it on yours.

00:57:09
metensis: chatgpt has the answer to your dish

00:57:13
fitzsimons_dev: well... maybe it will work. But I just encountered problem after problem

00:57:16
oskrm: cooking stream when? @adamdotdev

00:57:17
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Smart dribble. Okay, you go on, I'm going to raid you, and we'll just record on your stream.

00:57:22
mattmancodes: it could be as good as the vercel stream

00:57:24
srini0025: do you know how virtualization software is created ?

00:57:27
<transcript>: Oh, hey, it's almost an hour. So this was an hour stream of just talking. Turns out that's what happened. Dax is going to start up his stream. We're going to go over there and record the podcast.

00:57:27
<transcript>: could be as good

00:57:32
<transcript>: Could be as good as a versailles stream. Oh, I do want to talk for a few minutes while dax is getting all set up.

00:57:47
<transcript>: I have thoughts and I should just express them while all the west coasters are asleep. I can say really inflammatory things right now about versailles and nextjs and everything in javascript land because they're all asleep right now. They're on the West Coast. They won't be up for another like 4 hours.

00:57:53
<transcript>: That was my little dig at west coasters. And how late to sleep, big Fish. Thank you so much for the follow.

00:57:53
<transcript>: so

00:57:59
faffinaboot: West coast, sadly awake

00:58:01
<transcript>: So assuming no one clips any of this and it doesn't end up like the vod doesn't get a lot of traction or something. Let's talk about Versailles.

00:58:01
<transcript>: what was it

00:58:03
<transcript>: What was it I want to talk about.

00:58:03
<transcript>: rs

00:58:03
thdxr: theo is probably still awake

00:58:07
<transcript>: Rscs. No, I had some thing I wanted to talk about. What was it.

00:58:07
<transcript>: edge

00:58:12
<transcript>: Edge. No. Theo is probably so awake. Yeah, no kidding.

00:58:13
fitzsimons_dev: Mountain Time and awake

00:58:15
<transcript>: Doesn't go sleep for another hour.

00:58:25
<transcript>: Faffin, have you not gone to sleep yet? You're on the West Coast and you're still awake because you haven't gone to sleep.

00:59:31
<transcript>: I don't know. Maybe there's nothing to talk about. There's nothing else to talk about. With the Edge thing. Dax wrote the book. He finished that debate. He wrote the one message that will rule them all. I know. Theo is exactly scheduled because he starts liking my tweet three weeks.

00:59:39

<transcript>: Rscs.

00:59:48
fitzsimons_dev: that's what you said you wanted to talk about I thought

00:59:54
<transcript>: I asked cooking Stream Win. I don't think I'll be doing any cooking streams, although I do have all the gear. I could set it up in my kitchen and we could do a cooking stream. Maybe once we hire a personal chef.

<transcript>: i'll just have

00:59:57
oskrm: Sadge

warrenbuffering: Your tweet my internet this weekend. The insanely proven point, the ratio, all of it. https://twitter.com/adamdotdev/status/1654646121623330817?t=SYuYJo2aPGR6_YzUPDTT8g&s=19

01:00:13

01:00:13
<transcript>: is like

01:00:14
goodgrandpaa: "chef cam" redemption like zuko LUL

01:00:26
warrenbuffering: *instantly

01:00:33
<transcript>: Is like the main reason everyone started building spas by default. So if we all agree it was a bad thing for the web when everyone started just using React and building spas by default for everything, even when it shouldn't be a single page application like applications that absolutely should not have been client side rendered. People just defaulted to it for whatever reason, it became very popular.

01:00:47
samhuckaby: just got here and Adam seems mad. Love it.

01:00:47
cosmiclasagna: brb gotta go to back to back standups NotLikeThis

01:00:54
<transcript>: That was a problem. And I feel like rscs kind of addressed that problem that knew better default where things aren't just all client side rendered. But I'm not going to Pat them on the back for fixing a thing that they created. They created that situation. Everyone was fine with their php and their whatever else on the server. And then React came along and created this issue. And now it's like all.

01:00:54
<transcript>: ha

01:01:03
<transcript>: Hail versailles in nextjs and react because they save the day. They're taking us all to the server where everyone already was before they came along. You know what I'm saying.

01:01:03
<transcript>: it's just annoying

01:01:04
<transcript>: It's just annoying.

01:01:09
oskrm: new innovation

01:01:13
<transcript>: Your tweet my internet this weekend. The insanely proven point, the ratio, all of it. What was this one.

<transcript>: yeah how about

01:01:31
dnbull: geez twitter got yall brainwashed thinking vercel is taking over LUL

01:01:32
<transcript>: Yeah. How about this? I make a video about how I'm leaving React. I was not spicy in it. I just explained, like I'm just kind of done with React. And for these reasons.

01:01:32
<transcript>: just like

01:01:41
<transcript>: Just like I'm moving on. I did not say you should leave. React and react is bad, and everyone should abandon it. Didn't say that. But someone from meta has like a snarky.

01:01:41
<transcript>: tweet

01:01:43
<transcript>: Tweet in reply.

01:01:43
<transcript>: it's that guy

01:01:52
<transcript>: So I came back with a screenshot from my video.

01:01:52
<transcript>: where i say

01:02:09
<transcript>: Where I say pretentiousness and it's got the caption there and it's so true the meta team is so pretentious. Do they not hear themselves? Do they seriously not ever look in the mirror and hear themselves immorbac and prolific visuals. Thank you so much for the Follows and Big Fish. I don't know if I saw that one.

01:02:12

aj_stuyvenberg: @mehulsharmamat Try OpenNext, it's great

01:02:38
<transcript>: I wouldn't be mad if I were just a layer of all developer. I'd probably like have way less lines on my face. I'd just be a happy guy all the time.

01:02:44
<transcript>: But I'm a JavaScript developer, thus I'm just angry all the time.

01:02:44
<transcript>: i got to go back

01:02:48
<transcript>: I got to go back to stand up. I'm so sorry, cosmic. Good luck with that.

01:03:25
<transcript>: like

01:03:34
<transcript>: Like taylor's done very well. I don't know that every laravel dev is just doing that well, but taylor's obviously done well, and he didn't have to raise money. What a guy.

01:03:37
<transcript>: Try Open Next. It's great.

01:03:40
aj_stuyvenberg: what a lad

bweezy224: PHP ❤️❤️

01:04:00
<transcript>: What's it likes for sale and that's fine. I still think it's a good product. I don't know that it removes enough from my plate to choose it for like a startup, but for projects that I'm just putting a front end up on the web and I don't care or not a friend. I'm just putting a simple side up. I love it.

01:04:00
<transcript>: i've never

01:04:05
<transcript>: I've never heard the React team outside of Dan avery on Speak. What do they be saying.

01:04:05
<transcript>: maybe it's

01:04:13
<transcript>: Maybe it's not everybody on their team. I'm not saying everyone that's ever been on the React team is pretentious. I'm just saying that the ones that are most vocal.

01:04:13
<transcript>: are often pret

01:04:19
cosmiclasagna: also I think Astro's gonna be the actual modern PHP. its just a joy to work with!
