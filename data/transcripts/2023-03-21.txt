<transcript>: Remember when Twitter just worked every single day.

11:13:59
<transcript>: just like every

11:14:02
<transcript>: Just like every time you open Twitter, it worked. Remember that.

11:14:05
<transcript>: I remember that. That was nice.

11:14:05
<transcript>: and now it's

11:14:12
<transcript>: And now it's like sometimes you can tweet. Sometimes things load, sometimes they don't. It's kind of fun.

11:14:46
<transcript>: It looks nice on you cow face. It is funny.

11:14:59
<transcript>: My only perception of you people visually is your username. And it's funny how this is like you're you got a haircut or something like you're wearing a new shirt. Cafe.

11:15:04
<transcript>: Just some letters on a screen. Isn't that funny? It's funny to me.

11:15:21
<transcript>: good morning

11:15:22

11:15:57
oleksii_lisovyi: That's soy drink, because you know LOL

11:16:03
<transcript>: I think I'm gonna add this is gonna be my favorite channel player redemption. I'm gonna add a new channel plant redemption. That's like a slot machine. It's like every time you redeem it, it'll be like a thousand points or something. Every time you redeem it, you have like a 1% chance of winning a macbook. Wouldn't that be cool? That'd be cool.

11:16:03
<transcript>: then people are just

11:16:06
aj_stuyvenberg: yes

11:16:08
<transcript>: Then people are just redeeming their lot of tickets all day truman Shows. Thank you, daglie.

11:16:08
aj_stuyvenberg: that would be cool

11:16:14
<transcript>: Does that sound? Does that sound like a good, good plan? I think that would be cool. Something about that.

11:16:14
<transcript>: i like

11:16:22
sj_se: that might violate Twitch terms of service for gambling

11:16:23
<transcript>: I like giving MacBooks to people. Last time I gave a MacBook to somebody randomly, it was somebody that really needed it. And I feel like if I just let randomness take over.

11:16:24
tayloreddev: probably mess up the math and then everyone wins LUL

11:16:24
cowfacedev: less than 1%

11:16:29
<transcript>: And there we go, oh, is that gambling.

11:16:29
<transcript>: that's a good call

11:16:31
<transcript>: That's a good call that Jay does that violate something.

11:16:31
<transcript>: probably

11:16:34
cowfacedev: LUL @sj_se

11:16:35
<transcript>: Probably mess up the math, and then everyone wins.

11:16:41
<transcript>: Less than 1% and maybe it needs to be less than 1%. I don't know how many channel points are.

11:16:41
<transcript>: accrued

11:16:46
fragaverage: 👀

11:16:48
<transcript>: Accrued in a day's stream, but I need to probably do the math, figure out how often I can give away a MacBook.

11:16:48
daglee: Dunno, people make farming bots for twitch points.

11:16:50
<transcript>: Before it just gets.

11:16:50
<transcript>: somebody look

11:16:53
<transcript>: Somebody look up the could somebody tell me.

11:16:53
<transcript>: really quickly

11:16:56
cowfacedev: I got 12.6

11:16:58
alalfakawma: do you think setup is important for motivation?

11:16:59
<transcript>: Really quickly if I can do this so I don't get too excited. Can I not do this? Does anyone know.

11:17:03
<transcript>: People make farming bots for Twitch points.

11:17:06
<transcript>: Cafe.

11:17:06
<transcript>: that's

11:17:12
<transcript>: That's twelve tickets. Right there cafe for this fictional, fictitious, fictional.

11:17:12
<transcript>: for this

11:17:15
<transcript>: For this artistinal fictitious.

11:17:15
<transcript>: champpoint

11:17:19
<transcript>: Champpoint redemption that I have not created yet. You could buy twelve of them.

11:17:19
<transcript>: do you think

11:17:22
<transcript>: Do you think setup is important for motivation.

11:17:25
<transcript>: Set up is important for motivation.

11:17:25
<transcript>: could you

11:17:28
fragaverage: I have... a few... can you just make a 100k redeem for an m2 macbook? LUL

11:17:29
<transcript>: Could you allow could you just tell me what you mean by setup.

11:17:29
<transcript>: like

11:17:30
<transcript>: Like.

11:17:31
cowfacedev: well, 10k is roughly 24 hours of watchtime. on level1 sub.

11:17:33
<transcript>: Your computer setup? Is that what you mean.

11:17:33
<transcript>: frag

11:17:38
<transcript>: Frag, I have a few. Can you just make a hundred thousand routine for an M. Two MacBook.

11:17:43
cowfacedev: I think so.

11:17:44
<transcript>: Every time somebody hits, I just have a lot of people sticking around.

11:17:46
<transcript>: Whether they're watching or not, wouldn't I.

11:17:46
<transcript>: ten thousand

11:17:49
structuredchris: good morning-ish :)

11:17:52
<transcript>: 10,000 is roughly 24 hours of watch time on the Level One sub. Okay.

11:18:03
<transcript>: So ten that wait 10,000 is 24 hours. So I do four hour streams five days a week. That's 20 hours of streaming. If someone watch me for a full.

11:18:05
<transcript>: Week.

11:18:05
<transcript>: oh

11:18:07
<transcript>: Oh, they could do, like.

11:18:07
<transcript>: ten

11:18:10
alalfakawma: yeah, something like that, could be room setup, etc?

11:18:12
<transcript>: Ten chances. So they'd have a 10%. Is that how percentages work.

11:18:12
<transcript>: do percent

11:18:18
<transcript>: Do percentages work where you just add them all together? Are they additive? I feel like that's a word in math.

11:18:18
<transcript>: our percent

11:18:25
<transcript>: Our percentages additive. If you do something that has a 1% chance ten times, does that mean you have a 10% chance.

11:18:28
<transcript>: Anybody now.

11:18:28
<transcript>: good morning

11:18:29
mvanleest: Nope

11:18:31
structuredchris: yeah

11:18:32
<transcript>: Good Morning ish structure. Chris.

11:18:32
structuredchris: wait

11:18:33
oleksii_lisovyi: @alalfakawma That's probably more of making things better/faster etc, but certainly is not a key of motivation itself IMHO.

11:18:37
structuredchris: maybe

11:18:37
mvanleest: 10 times 1%

11:18:37
<transcript>: Now structured. Chris, I don't know if you know this, but Calfase showed up today was a different username.

11:18:41
sudo_says: no they are independent evetns

11:18:47
<transcript>: He's no longer cow face. Uhoh, what were you, cafe? He's always the previous Catholic. She's down. Cafe. Dev. What were you, calva's? Calf face. What.

11:18:47
<transcript>: something

11:18:50
<transcript>: Something. I saw it like every day.

11:18:59
cowfacedev: it was cowfacedude.

11:18:59
<transcript>: Cow face. He's now cafes dev. And it threw me off. He looks totally different if you came in as unstructured. Chris.

11:18:59
<transcript>: that would just be

11:19:00
<transcript>: That would just be.

11:19:00
<transcript>: i would know what to do

11:19:04
<transcript>: I would know what to do. I probably wouldn't know it was you. He looks so different.

11:19:07
<transcript>: So Alas.

11:19:07
<transcript>: could be

11:19:11
<transcript>: Could be yeah. Something like that could be room setup, etc.

11:19:11
<transcript>: i think here's what

11:19:14
<transcript>: I think here's what I think I have a take. I have a take on this.

11:19:14
<transcript>: no clip

11:19:16
<transcript>: No clip me.

11:19:16
<transcript>: seriously

11:19:19
<transcript>: Seriously. No, my take is.

11:19:19
<transcript>: i don't

11:19:26
<transcript>: I don't understand I feel so one thing I guess that's I gotta remember is US. Tech money is absurd.

11:19:26
<transcript>: or was it

11:19:29
<transcript>: Or was it absurd? I don't know. It might be ending.

11:19:31
structuredchris: ooo that'd be wild, idk if I can wake up unstructured

11:19:35
<transcript>: Internationally I know devs don't make what us devs make, but I think on whole devs as a group.

11:19:36
aj_stuyvenberg: still is.

11:19:43
<transcript>: Spin too little on their office, on their work setup, on their whatever.

11:19:43
<transcript>: like

11:19:52
tayloreddev: I should really invest more

11:20:03
<transcript>: Like, I know a lot of people buy the $5000 macbooks, and that's another big expense for a computer. But like, for how much we get paid. Is it? I don't know. I think that kind of stuff helps. I think good equipment. Not like having really old, slow equipment. It's helpful, just practically speaking. But then also, I do think it's something about having a nice office environment.

11:20:03
<transcript>: to walk into

11:20:07
<transcript>: To walk into if you even have an office, I realize I'm speaking.

11:20:07
<transcript>: out of

11:20:09
<transcript>: Out of so much privilege, I can't even see it.

11:20:13
tayloreddev: 2013 macbook still going strong

11:20:14
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: waiting on new threadripper

11:20:14
<transcript>: But if you do have a space that you work in, I think putting money into it.

11:20:14
<transcript>: making sure

11:20:25
<transcript>: Making sure it's nice and you enjoy being in it when you spend a lot of hours there. I think it's I think it's important. And I don't see a lot of people doing it. I don't know. I mean, there's people that do it.

11:20:25
<transcript>: anyway

11:20:27
<transcript>: Anyway. Okay. I've said too much.

11:20:27
<transcript>: and again

11:20:30
<transcript>: And Again, none of you live in America.

11:20:30
<transcript>: and

11:20:31
ttbishop: it is .. I got 2 kids in private schools (cheap relative to US) and a house mortgage. I make ~85k a year and yeah .. don't spend much on my office

11:20:31
<transcript>: And.

11:20:31
<transcript>: you're not

11:20:32
cowfacedev: well, I spent half of my salary on my keyboard...so I can't really speak LUL

11:20:37
oleksii_lisovyi: The issue is that $5k is still $5k in US, EU and other countries when you can't earn the same money

11:20:37
<transcript>: You're not making us tech money, necessarily. And I should stop. I'm gonna stop now.

11:20:40
<transcript>: Welcome to chat.

11:20:40
<transcript>: in van eas

11:20:42
<transcript>: In Van East.

11:20:42
<transcript>: what was the

11:20:47
<transcript>: What was the. Nope. Oh, they're not additive. Percentages, not additive. Okay.

11:20:47
<transcript>: so you can't

11:20:49
<transcript>: So you can't add them all together.

11:20:49
<transcript>: okay

11:21:01
<transcript>: Okay. It's probably more of making things better, faster, but certainly is not a key of motivation itself. Am I opinion? Yeah. No. I don't think it's a key. I do think I love my office.

11:21:01
<transcript>: and if i

11:21:06
richfrandotdev: 100% agree on having a nice home office, something I have spent a lot of money on improving since suddenly being home based since covid.

11:21:07
<transcript>: And if I spend 8 hours a day in here, it's nice to love your office. That's what I would say.

11:21:16
<transcript>: Ten times 1%, ten times less. You just get ten 1% tries. But that's not a 10% chance, okay.

11:21:16
<transcript>: i should know that

11:21:19
<transcript>: I should know. That sounds like basic math.

11:21:19
<transcript>: inde

11:21:24
vimcerf: @cowFaceDev your boss should pay you more

11:21:26
<transcript>: Independent events. Okay, it was calface. Dude, that's right. So not a huge change.

11:21:26
<transcript>: you also

11:21:28
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: @ttbishop A nice wool deskmat...a custom keyboard.... dunno...maybe ambient lighting or a nice wood desk? SAmall things

11:21:33
<transcript>: You also changed the capitalization, though. Calf base. You went to a camel casing. And I notice. I see those camel humps.

11:21:33
<transcript>: i noticed

11:21:40
<transcript>: I noticed the casing change. You should have gone to Bob. Can you do kebab that you probably can't do it on a username.

11:21:41
aj_stuyvenberg: adam - do you have an opinion on using the v2 aws-sdk vs the v2 aws-sdk? HarleyWink

11:21:48
<transcript>: That'd be wild. I don't know if I can wake up unstructured. Yeah, that would be too wild. Let's let's just stick with the structured. Okay, Chris.

11:21:48
<transcript>: let's not go

11:21:50
<transcript>: Let's not go crazy.

11:21:50
<transcript>: i should really

11:22:01
<transcript>: I should really invest more 2013 macbook still okay, so tech money in us still is crazy. Aj says I shouldn't invest more 2013 macbook's still going strong. Yeah. Taylor. I don't know. I think like.

11:22:01
<transcript>: i think

11:22:10
<transcript>: I think what are all the sometimes I'm like, Do I come off as super? Well on Twitter because like yesterday I tweeted something and dax pointed out.

11:22:10
<transcript>: that maybe i'm not

11:22:15
<transcript>: That maybe I'm not the most relatable person, but like why if we all make tech money.

11:22:15
<transcript>: and then

11:22:19
fragaverage: yeah the conversion is weird on apple products too, because for example if it was a $3000 product, they literally sell it for £3000 (British Pounds), which equates to around $4000. SAME PRODUCT

11:22:24
<transcript>: And then I'm like, oh, because I live in a really cheap place, so I make us tech money. But I live in a really cheap place in the US. So I think that's why I feel like.

11:22:24
<transcript>: why doesn't everybody

11:22:33
<transcript>: Why doesn't everybody spend their money like I do? I don't know. Feels like we all make a ton of money, and we have for a long time. But I'm just projecting. Okay.

11:22:36
<transcript>: The Real enrico Paladin.

11:22:36
<transcript>: waiting

11:22:39
<transcript>: Waiting on new thread. Ripper? Is there a new.

11:22:39
<transcript>: processor

11:22:40
<transcript>: Processor coming out.

11:22:44
mvanleest: 10% chance to win. Try it 10 times, you are not guaranteed of winning 1 time. If you try a million times, you will see that it will average to about the 10%.

11:22:59
<transcript>: Tba ship it is. I got two kids in private schools, cheap relative to us and a house mortgage. I make 85,000 a year and yeah, don't spend much on my office. Yeah. No, that makes sense. I mean, I think we also have like just my family has weird circumstances. Like we don't have.

11:23:00
structuredchris: i rebuild my pc once every 7 years for max £1.2k, I assume its better performance than a mac still lol dunno how long a 4k mac lasts

11:23:00
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: @FragAverage Get a ticket to USA...have some fun...buy cheaper...fly back... Step4: PROFIT!

11:23:07
<transcript>: A lot of major expenses. We have an extremely affordable mortgage, surprisingly for having a really awesome house that we just built last year.

11:23:11
<transcript>: Okay. Granted. Again. I'm speaking from so much.

11:23:12
cowfacedev: well, US tech money is not the same as Indian tech money. and the imports/duties are not cheap..

11:23:18
<transcript>: We did put a lot of cash into the house while we built it. So our mortgage is low because we paid for.

11:23:18
<transcript>: a third of it

11:23:20
<transcript>: A third of it just in cash.

11:23:20
<transcript>: but

11:23:22
<transcript>: But.

11:23:24
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: @structuredchris oh boy....ur in fora surprise on the new prices ^^

11:23:24
fragaverage: @FragAverage Have you seen the price of flights from UK to US lately LUL Love to go though

11:23:29
<transcript>: Yeah. Our mortgage is low. We don't have private school. We do the home school thing, although we're we're talking about doing a private school in the fall.

11:23:29
<transcript>: for our oldest

11:23:37
<transcript>: For our oldest. Okay, anyway, I'm sorry. I'm getting way off on personal finances. No one asks. Well, I spent half of my salary on my keyboard.

11:23:39
<transcript>: That's funny.

11:23:47
barryxbtw: How was it saving up for paying off the 3rd of the house, did you go deep in planning

11:23:48
<transcript>: The issue is that five K is still five K in US, EU and other countries when you can't earn the same money. Yeah, yeah. The US Tech money thing. I got to remember.

11:23:48
<transcript>: it's a bubble

11:23:49
richfrandotdev: If you took my job as a salesforce dev in the UK, looked at the same job in the US it is over double and if you convert it back to GBP it will still be 40k more or so haha

11:24:02
<transcript>: It's a bubble here in the US that people all over the world do not. Developers don't all make what US developers make, which is so dumb. I hate that so much. I hate and I've had to deal with it. Living in the ozarks, people who are like.

11:24:02
<transcript>: well

11:24:04
danielgerep: Conversations about tools are always so weird to me. Not always but it sounds like excuses "if I had a mechanical keyboard", "if I had the new MacBook", "if I had an external monitor" and so on...

11:24:10
<transcript>: Well, you don't get paid to sell somebody in San Francisco because your cost of living so much like that's not my fault. They can live somewhere else.

11:24:10
<transcript>: like why

11:24:19
<transcript>: Like, Why is it my fault somebody lives in San Francisco and chooses to live in the most expensive city in the world? I don't care. We all work remotely. I don't care.

11:24:33
<transcript>: It's so dumb to me. Like and I can't. I'm imagine how it feels being overseas doing the same work is you're American colleagues and getting paid. It's just so dumb. The whole geography face pay thing, it needs to die a thousand deaths. Sorry. I'm getting all worked up.

11:24:36
<transcript>: I got a calm down, okay.

11:24:39
aj_stuyvenberg: Wife works in a biotech lab, no remote option. So we're in boston :(

11:24:42
structuredchris: @structuredchris nah its good I got a rebuild in before corona hit :) hehe

11:24:46
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: @FragAverage Just checked now....500$ return ticket Heathrow -> JFK

11:24:46
<transcript>: 100% agree on having an iphone office something. I spent a lot of money on improving since suddenly being homebased since covet. Yeah, I think a lot more people are able to work from home now.

11:24:46
<transcript>: so

11:24:58
<transcript>: So. Yeah. I think it's not like I'm saying, you have to spend a ton of money. I'm just thinking, like having a nice office that you enjoy being in. It's worth it. If you have the money, you have the means.

11:24:58
<transcript>: your boss

11:25:00
<transcript>: Your boss should pay you more.

11:25:20
<transcript>: Nice wool decks, desk. Matt. A custom keyboard. You know, maybe ambient lighting are nice with this. Small things. Exactly. Small things. Aj. Adam, do you have an opinion on using the V two? A to bss sdk versus the V two? A to bs sdk? Wait a minute. You mean V Two versus V Three? I believe that was typo. Oh, wow. I got behind you guys are all typing.

11:25:20
<transcript>: okay i'm gonna

11:25:23
aj_stuyvenberg: ah yes v2 vs v3

11:25:24
tayloreddev: I agree, i earn a London salary now but live in the north of england where the cost of living is less

11:25:40
<transcript>: Okay, I'm gonna go fast. You mean V two versus V three. So I thought I should use V three, and then I hear people like you and dax. So they're smart being, like, actually, the cold starts. So I wish V three was, like, good. And they did the right thing with the SM or whatever, where it would tree shake or whatever. The word is, where it would be tiny. And you could just import the part you need. I wish that was the case. It.

11:25:40
<transcript>: sounds like

11:25:48
<transcript>: Sounds like it's not, though, so I've prefer now using the V Three api. I'm just used to the ergonomics of using the V Three SDK.

11:25:48
<transcript>: i prefer

11:25:59
<transcript>: I prefer when I say the api, not the A to this api. The api of the library. Like how you interact with it. I prefer V three, but is it bad? Do the cold starts. You just killing yourself.

11:25:59
<transcript>: okay

11:26:11
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah. The conversion is weird on Apple products, too, because, for example, it was if it was a $3000 product, they literally sell it for $3000 or 3000 British pounds to reach to $4000, same product. That's so dumb.

11:26:11
<transcript>: they get

11:26:11
aj_stuyvenberg: Not too bad if you use esbuild

11:26:13
structuredchris: this is best chat, no kap. only essays.. always

11:26:18
<transcript>: They get away with that. Do the brits just say, forget you, Apple. We're gonna buy Android phones because that's what I do.

11:26:32
<transcript>: 10% just out of protest you know 10% chance to win try it ten times you are not guaranteed of winning one time. If you try a million times you will see that it will average to about the 10%. Wow. It take a million times to get 10%. That's crazy.

11:26:32
<transcript>: i

11:26:43
<transcript>: I rebuilt my PC once every seven years for Max one, two K assume it's better for us then Mac still the know how long on the 4k Maclass? I have no idea. I've got this Mac studio and I love it but I don't know.

11:26:43
<transcript>: it lasts

11:26:45
cowfacedev: One funny joke btw, if I fly to Dubai, get the latest Iphone, do sightseeing and come back, I would be in profit LUL.

11:26:47
<transcript>: It lasts until the next lifecycle and if you got the money to spend.

11:26:55
<transcript>: Get a ticket to USA have some fun bite cheaper fly back step four profit oh, by an iphone I see.

11:27:05
<transcript>: Okay, let's see. Did it. Well, US tech money is not same as Indian tech money and the import studies are not cheap.

11:27:11
<transcript>: Have you seen the process applies from you here. How is it saying that surface has.

11:27:12
i_amazin_: @TayloredDev What's london dev salary like? If you don't mind me asking

11:27:18
<transcript>: Wait. How was it saving up for paying off the third of the house? Did you go deep in planning? Oh, so Barry.

11:27:18
<transcript>: i had

11:27:21
<transcript>: I had a little exit so that it's cheating.

11:27:29
<transcript>: When you can, like, sell a huge chunk of your private equity of a company to investors.

11:27:29
<transcript>: then that

11:27:35
<transcript>: Then that that sort of cheat code. So it wasn't that I, like, planned really well and saved really well.

11:27:38
fragaverage: @FragAverage Yup, about a year ago those tickets were up to around $750, and with travel costs just wouldn't be worth it. Little more worthwhile now!

11:27:39
<transcript>: I'm not that great with money, but.

11:27:39
<transcript>: i was fortunate

11:27:59
<transcript>: I was fortunate. I was lucky in the right place, right time. That whole thing built with thing for eight years that people liked and then was able to sell a big chunk of the equity. If you took my job as a sales first did in the UK, looks at the same job in the US, it is over double. And if you convert it back to great British pounds, it will still be 40 calories, 40k more or so. Oh, wow. That math hurt my.

11:27:59
<transcript>: brain clearly

11:28:12
<transcript>: Brain. Clearly, I'm not good at math, Daniel Grip conversations about tools or always so weird to me. Not always. But it sounds like excuses. If I had a mechanical keyboard, if I had the new macbook, I had an external modern so on. Yeah, yeah, no, that's definitely a thing.

11:28:16
tsoutsou_proutsou: @adamdotdev Hey buddy. Would you prefer to live in the USA with a high salary, or work remotely from a less expensive location while still receiving a high salary?

11:28:16
<transcript>: Wifi Workshop lab. No remote option. So we're in Boston.

11:28:16
<transcript>: boston

11:28:18
<transcript>: Boston.

11:28:23
<transcript>: So. Okay. So are you saying aj, like you have to live in Boston.

11:28:33
<transcript>: So you should get paid more as a dev than somebody that lives somewhere else because your cost saving is higher. So I'm trying to look at through your viewpoint. And I do see your case like.

11:28:33
<transcript>: i have to

11:28:37
aj_stuyvenberg: No not at all, but I do have to live in boston

11:28:49
<transcript>: I have to pay twice what anim has to pay for cost of living. So you should pay me more or I can't work here. It's a supply demand that if it's just a market thing, that makes sense, if it's just a way. Okay. So if it's a way for Dev to leverage their situation and get paid better.

11:28:56
aj_stuyvenberg: People should be paid their value

11:28:58
<transcript>: That I'm good with. I'm not good with the company, the people doing the hiring, deciding to have a stance that they're going to pay people differently based on geography.

11:28:59
aj_stuyvenberg: regardless of where they live.

11:29:12
<transcript>: Like it's an individual decision, I guess. And it's all about leverage. If the employee prospective employee, if you want them bad enough and as a leverage and they can demand more because they live in a more expensive market. Or they're just more talented. That's fine.

11:29:12
<transcript>: it just bothers

11:29:15
aj_stuyvenberg: Datadog pays everyone in the US along the same pay bands, regardless of location.

11:29:17
<transcript>: It just bothers me when hiring people. And I know these people. I've listened to these people talk.

11:29:17
<transcript>: when

11:29:26
<transcript>: When? Well, they live in South Africa, so, like, we don't have to pay them, but, like, I hate that stuff that just pitches me off so bad. Okay.

11:29:26
<transcript>: it's

11:29:29
basileus__: Companies do that because they look at employees as resources, not people with unique traits and skills

11:29:30
<transcript>: It's good. I got a rebuild in before corona hit.

11:29:30
<transcript>: okay

11:29:32
<transcript>: Okay gotta go faster.

11:29:38
<transcript>: You agree? Iron a Luna shy that live in the north of England.

11:29:38
<transcript>: is

11:29:45
tayloreddev: @TayloredDev Ranges vary I typically see £80k -120k

11:29:45
<transcript>: Is less not too bad if you use es build oh okay so the cold starts on V three not so bad if you see us build good to know.

11:29:55
<transcript>: Wait. One funny joke. If I fly to Dubai, get the latest iphone do sizing and come back, I would be in prison.

11:29:55
<transcript>: whoa

11:29:57
aj_stuyvenberg: there are regional differences in different countries where we operate, I don't know all the guides. But pay ranges are public on the careers page.

11:30:04
<transcript>: Whoa, and you get a trip to Dubai. Welcome to Chat. I Amazem. What's the London death? Oh, if you don't mind me asking you're talking to somebody else.

11:30:04
<transcript>: hey

11:30:07
<transcript>: Hey, buddy, would you prefer to live in the US.

11:30:21
basileus__: One of my colleagues took a paycut because he moved state... same guy, same output, less money ??? make it make sense lol

11:30:27
<transcript>: With a high salary, or we're promotely from a less extensive location while still receiving a high salary. So here's the thing to sue. I live in the ozarks. It's already a pretty low cost of living here. Like it's nothing like living on the coast. So when you hear about people in the US that like work in California, and they make a lot of money. But.

11:30:27
<transcript>: they

11:30:29
<transcript>: They spend a lot of money to live.

11:30:29
<transcript>: i make

11:30:33
i_amazin_: @TayloredDev Damn, that's pretty good, but man London is expensive.

11:30:34
<transcript>: I make that money. The California Tech money. But I live in a place.

11:30:34
<transcript>: that's more

11:30:51
<transcript>: That's more like living in Canada. I don't know. I'm just trying to throw out a place that's similar. It's like rural America. It's pretty cheap because nobody wants to live here. I want to live here because I love it. I mean, I love the cost of living, the people in the social and all that not so much, but.

11:30:51
<transcript>: all my

11:30:53
tsoutsou_proutsou: osark? live the movie? :D

11:30:53
<transcript>: All my family's here.

11:30:53
<transcript>: and

11:30:54
tayloreddev: thats why i don;t live in london LUL

11:30:54
<transcript>: And.

11:30:54
<transcript>: yeah

11:30:56
oleksii_lisovyi: I would only argue to consider spending money on things which keep your health. E.g. I'm personally having issues with tunnel syndrome, so I've started with purchasing a split ergo keyboard. And there are things, but they are not necessarily about the office setup. Good food, sleep schedule etc. matters as much as the good chair in the office.   That pays off tho within time and being young you don't notice things, but they collect in time, so you start noticing them for sure, hopefully not too

11:30:58
oleksii_lisovyi: *later

11:31:01
oleksii_lisovyi: *late

11:31:02
richfrandotdev: @i_amazin_ Long as you are on a mainline train line into London you can get the best of both or go fully remote :D

11:31:02
<transcript>: Yeah. I enjoy it. So that's the that's the the reward for living. The ozarks is low cost of living.

11:31:02
<transcript>: i still make

11:31:09
<transcript>: I still make the high tech money because I refuse to let someone pay me less. I'm gonna get paid whatever I want to get paid. You know what I'm saying.

11:31:09
<transcript>: okay

11:31:10
<transcript>: Okay.

11:31:19
<transcript>: That's the but I do have to live in Boston. People should be paid their value. Yes. Paid their value regardless where they live. Exactly.

11:31:19
<transcript>: on the same page

11:31:31
<transcript>: On the same page. Datadoc pays. Everyone in the US will on the same pay bands regardless of location. See? Okay. So there are good organizations doing the right thing. That sounds nice. I'm happy for Day to Dog. I'm glad that that exists.

11:31:43
danielgerep: After hard work, I'm in a good place. I live in Brazil and work for a US company.

11:31:45
<transcript>: If I could figure out how to get it to not Zoom in on me when I take a drink, that would be fantastic. Sutu. Thank you so much for that. Resub. I appreciate that I said resub.

11:31:45
<transcript>: i'm assuming

11:31:50
<transcript>: I'm assuming it's a reset because it doesn't show up in my activity. I just heard the little thing.

11:31:53
<transcript>: And I didn't see it. So that's my assumption.

11:31:53
<transcript>: if

11:31:58
<transcript>: If that reservation is the first up. Thank you for the first time ever. I appreciate that.

11:32:18
<transcript>: Baptilis companies do that because they look at employees as resources, not people with unique traits and skills. Exactly. Bachelor, stupid companies. I hate them. Sorry, I'm getting all worked up. Range is very typically. There are regional differences in different countries where we operate. I don't know all these guys. The pay ranges are public on the Careers page. Nice. See, they're doing it right.

11:32:22
<transcript>: One of my colleagues who can pick up because he moved state.

11:32:31
<transcript>: Same guy, same output, less money. Make it make sense. It doesn't make sense. I can't make it make sense because it doesn't make sense. Sorry.

11:32:31
<transcript>: my kids

11:32:33
<transcript>: My kids so weird.

11:32:33
<transcript>: just can't

11:32:36
<transcript>: Just can't get it where I want it.

11:32:38
<transcript>: It doesn't make sense.

11:32:42
<transcript>: Ozark. Like the movie. Yeah. Like the TV show on Netflix.

11:32:45
<transcript>: Slightly less exciting.

11:32:52
danielgerep: Covid forced a lot of good changes.

11:32:57
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't. I don't understand how how employers. Well, they give away with it. That's how they can justify it. Like if they keep getting away with it, they're gonna keep doing it.

11:32:57
<transcript>: and

11:33:00
<transcript>: And I've heard.

11:33:12
devinda_me: I live in Sri Lanka and work with an Australian company. I didn't let my employers get away with it lol

11:33:20
<transcript>: Oh, I get so mad. I've heard these words from employers mouths. So I did a lot of consulting, right. So I've worked with the people who hire. Plus, I was at a startup. We hired people. So I've been in the position of listening to people and having the ear of people who do hiring and hiring, specifically, software engineers. So I.

11:33:20
<transcript>: have

11:33:30
<transcript>: Have a lot of that insight, and I've heard things like, oh, well, they're just gonna try and arbitrage and move to some cheaper location. That's not good. We can't let people.

11:33:30
<transcript>: start out

11:33:32
<transcript>: Start out in California.

11:33:32
<transcript>: and get

11:33:40
<transcript>: And get paid California money and then move out of the state just to avoid the cost of living. Like, Why can't we let people do that? We can't let people improve their situation and their lives.

11:33:40
<transcript>: it's the dumbest

11:33:44
<transcript>: It's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life. Makes me so mad. Okay.

11:33:46
<transcript>: Let's have a good day.

11:33:49
<transcript>: Let's choose to have a good day.

11:33:49
<transcript>: and

11:33:50
<transcript>: And.

11:33:50
<transcript>: we must stop thinking

11:33:55
juniornascm: Good morning everyone!

11:34:05
<transcript>: We must stop thinking about this because it brings up some old traumas, some problems I have with Silicon Valley. So I have a real big chip on my shoulder about Silicon Valley just as a place. I just kind of hate it. Everything about it, the culture, the people and all of their.

11:34:05
<transcript>: people

11:34:25
<transcript>: Peopleness the way they've become. Not all the people, the people who moved in because of the Tech gold rush or whatever and pushed out all the real people that lived in San Francisco. It's not San francisco's fault. It's not the city of San francisco's fault. I mean, I don't know anything about it. San Francisco. I don't know. It might be their fault, but it's not like the people who actually live there before.

11:34:26
mjewl: rage Adam, can we pivot into VCs as a topic when we are at it? adamdo8Kappa

11:34:33
<transcript>: The Tech Boom. It's the Tech bros. That came in and made it the most gun, awful place on the face of the planet. Sorry. I'm done. Okay.

11:34:43
<transcript>: Well, this is one way to wake me up. I guess I'm feeling much more alive than I was yesterday. I should read chat. I'm getting behind.

11:34:46
<transcript>: Ozark. Yeah. That's why I don't live in London.

11:34:49
<transcript>: I would argue.

11:34:49
<transcript>: consider

11:34:49
danielgerep: Breath in....breath out....

11:34:52
<transcript>: Consider spending money on things which keep your health example.

11:34:52
<transcript>: personally having issues

11:35:01
tsoutsou_proutsou: @adamdotdev I have a question regarding mentors. If you are a European developer and aspire to reach the FAANG level, is it worth considering hiring a mentor, such as mentorcruise  (not promoting, just using as an example), to assist you in preparing for FAANG interviews? Or would this be a waste of time?

11:35:11
<transcript>: Personally having issues with Tunnel Syndrome. Oh, we had the wrist thing. So I've started with purchasing a split ergo keyboard. And things are there are things, but they are not necessarily about the opposite. Up, good food, sleep schedule, etc. Matters as much as a good chair in my office that pays off, though within time and being young and you don't notice things, but they collect time. Yes, absolutely.

11:35:21
<transcript>: And what I would say is like I only spend I don't know 2% of my gross income on like work expenses, things from office things for whatever.

11:35:21
<transcript>: like i don't

11:35:23
<transcript>: Like I don't spend a lot.

11:35:30
<transcript>: But it ends up being a lot of money because I make a lot of money. You know what I mean? Like, I feel like people don't even spend too percent. They just sort of like.

11:35:30
<transcript>: work in coffee shop

11:35:34
epicino: Fun thing is that when I was younger (teenage years) silicon valley looked like the dream, getting older it's realizing that it's pretty darn good here in Europe

11:35:41
<transcript>: Work in coffee shops on their laptop, and they make $150,000 a year. I don't understand. It okay, long as you were on a main line trail. Okay, I gotta stop reading all the commuting stuff.

11:35:41
<transcript>: because i

11:35:44
<transcript>: Because I can't catch up oh, I'm almost there.

11:36:01
<transcript>: After hard work, I'm in a good place. I live in Brazil and work for a US company. There you go, Daniel. That's the way covet did force a lot of good changes. It's true. A lot more companies went remote. That said I had just read about amazon's layoffs yesterday. The 9000 new layoff at twitch, aws and Amazon.

11:36:01
<transcript>: and

11:36:09
<transcript>: And I read that one of the factors is that they're really trying to push coming back into the office and people who aren't willing or don't live in the geography.

11:36:30
<transcript>: Are, like, more susceptible to the layoffs and that's that's not good. That's a bad precedent. Like if we're headed toward. Oh, you can't come back into the office. Well, sorry you're laid off like that's not good. I hope that doesn't. I hope people aren't trying to reverse that trend. I know they are trying. I hope they don't succeed. I hope they just fail to get anybody worth hiring because.

11:36:30
<transcript>: not anybody

11:36:35
oleksii_lisovyi: @adamdotdev BTW you can make so much content of your takes

11:36:39
<transcript>: Not anybody worthy, but I hope that like they struggle to compete because they refuse to let people work from home, because they're living in the 1990s.

11:36:39
<transcript>: so dumb

11:36:49
<transcript>: So dumb. It's so dumb. The whole like, you have to come into the office so we can watch you is the dumbest thing in the world. I really just don't like employers. I think I just don't like people who employ.

11:36:49
<transcript>: that that's why i

11:36:53
laytanl_: Morning!

11:36:55

11:36:58
tayloreddev: mandated back to office is a backwards step for sure

11:37:06
<transcript>: More leverage per developer and developers could build whatever they want and just give a big Fu to every startup and every employer because they can build their own thing and make their own money. I just love that movie.

11:37:10
<transcript>: They're empowered, individual. I love it.

11:37:10

If you are a European developer and aspiring to reach the thing level, is it worth considering hiring a mentor such as Mentor cruise not promoting just using examples to assist you in preparing for fang interviews. Or would this be a waste of time? Okay.

11:38:16

aj_stuyvenberg: where is dax?

11:38:39
<transcript>: You just can't take anything I say without, like, understanding all of my biases. But when I read to reach the Fang level, it just pains me because I know, I know that a lot of people like, they hope this fire to reach the Fang level. They want to be hired by Fang. And that's a goal. And that just hurts my soul because.

11:38:39
<transcript>: i can't imagine

11:38:59
<transcript>: I can't imagine wanting to work at one of the fang companies or manga companies, or whatever they are. I can't imagine, like making that a goal or viewing that is some achievement. Not that it's not an achievement. Obviously. Like you're recognized as somebody who's able to get a job at one of those places that's I'm not trying to like, just pee all over that. But like, that would be something you aspire to.

11:38:59
<transcript>: when

11:39:02
<transcript>: When I feel like there are so many better paths.

11:39:13
<transcript>: And like that to me would be one of the worst. Like if I had to go work for a manga company, I would because I can't find a way to make a living. Otherwise like that would be a last resort for me.

11:39:13
<transcript>: so it bum

11:39:32
<transcript>: So it bumbs me out that. And I'm not saying, tooto, that this is your goal in life. But I do. It just reminds me that I know a lot of developers view that it's like this pinnacle of their career when, like, I don't know. Yeah. There's like, you get free food at the Google campus. But is that worth working for Google.

11:39:32
<transcript>: i don't think

11:39:36
<transcript>: I don't think so. I would much rather work for myself.

11:39:36
<transcript>: from home

11:39:43
<transcript>: From home. Not that like everyone's gonna do that. And that that's a path that's open to every. But I feel like.

11:39:43
<transcript>: it's just

11:39:55
overra_dev: same

11:40:01
<transcript>: It's just. It bums me out that the manga company have succeeded in, like, creating this aura that they're this elite place you want to be. And if you could just make it there, you've reached the top. Sorry. Okay. And then they have the whole interview process that sucks, too. Just everything about it. I just hate it. I'm sorry.

11:40:01
<transcript>: so

11:40:02
tsoutsou_proutsou: It seems to be a form of self-achievement, as if you are striving to become a skilled developer. working there

11:40:07
<transcript>: So do I recommend a Mentor or a Mint or Cruise? I don't know what many.

11:40:07
thdxr: are you talking about google

11:40:11
<transcript>: Mentors are great if you can find people.

11:40:31
<transcript>: That are further along, the new that can share, you know, insights, things that they've learned along the way. That sounds wonderful. I don't know what Mentor Cruz is. I don't know if it's reputable. I don't know. I just don't know. So I recommend finding mentors in whatever shape or form you can.

11:40:37
devinda_me: i'd like to work at a faang to learn how to work at scale. but then i might not get to wear multiple hats as i do now !

11:40:39
<transcript>: More than one of them. Because one of them might have a lot of biases. Like me. They might be an idiot. And they might tell you things you shouldn't hear. Like, don't worry, Fang.

11:40:39
<transcript>: thanks

11:40:44
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow it be what it do is that actually a website.

11:40:44
<transcript>: it be

11:40:46
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: FAANG is not the pinnacle. Aspiring to be like people like Carmack, Torvalds etc....that is the Pinnacle

11:40:46
<transcript>: It be what it do.

11:40:46
<transcript>: com

11:40:47
<transcript>: Com.

11:40:50
aj_stuyvenberg: here is dax

11:40:52
thdxr: don't work at FAANG plz

11:41:07
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Eppuccino. Fun thing is that when I was younger, teenage years, Silicon Valley looked like the dream getting older. It's realizing that it's pretty good here in Europe. Yes. I think you guys have figured out a lot of things in Europe that I wish we would figure out in the US. Alexey, by the way, you can make so much content of your.

11:41:07
<transcript>: takes

11:41:12
thdxr: been saying this for years and it's more true today than ever

11:41:18
<transcript>: Takes. Can I? I don't know. I feel like I have the weirdest social media takes. Yeah. Dax agrees. Don't work at fang. Like I just. I don't. I don't. I'm not very related.

11:41:18
<transcript>: dax knows

11:41:19
itbewhatitdodotcom: no it isnt

11:41:24
<transcript>: Dax knows. I'm just not very relatable. I think my personality not the best for social media.

11:41:26
tayloreddev: I've never had the desire to work at FAANG

11:41:27
<transcript>: I just I don't have a lot.

11:41:27
<transcript>: similar to

11:41:27
imperialguard1: The industrial revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.

11:41:29
<transcript>: Similar to a lot of people.

11:41:36
<transcript>: And I think you need to be somewhat related to be really good at social media. I don't know. I'm making this stuff up. What do I know.

11:41:36
<transcript>: but

11:41:41
<transcript>: But I don't make a lot of content out of my takes because I just don't feel like.

11:41:41
<transcript>: they're

11:41:43
<transcript>: They're.

11:41:45
<transcript>: They're like a good.

11:41:45
overra_dev: I get what you mean adam

11:42:04
thdxr: hey people love a unique perspective

11:42:05
<transcript>: Syndrome. In reality. Take, they're like this guy from the ozarks take. And I don't know if you can trust them latent here. Good morning, leyton. Taylor mandated back to the office's backwards. That for sure. Yeah. I hate that personally. Enjoy looking at prime on things like that from real life as well as technical topics. Yeah. Prime is just a fantastic human being. And I would listen to everything.

11:42:05
<transcript>: he says

11:42:07
<transcript>: He says. Use him as a mentor.

11:42:07
<transcript>: as much as you can

11:42:09
<transcript>: As much as you can.

11:42:09
<transcript>: just

11:42:12
statsndata: Good Morning chat

11:42:14
<transcript>: Just join his streams. The guy he's the best I'm in. Granted, the streams are more like.

11:42:14
<transcript>: entertainment

11:42:14
overra_dev: different lifestyle in ozarks vs city where majority of people likely are?

11:42:24
basileus__: if you share it people who identify with it will congregate

11:42:25
<transcript>: Entertainment value. I wish prime would like, I wish you would do some stuff off twitch because twitch is like, he's gonna be prime. I want you to do some stuff that was more like.

11:42:25
<transcript>: it could be the same

11:42:30
itbewhatitdodotcom: the name is from when I owned the domain for a little bit - didnt end up using it

11:42:35
juniornascm: i fell like fang is more appleing for those who dont live in us. is like the americanization in media, movies, people want a better life. I see much of this in Brazil, people complaning and think that in US or other countries they will be better in life

11:42:39
<transcript>: It could be the same audience. I'm sure everyone would follow him wherever he went, but like more like real person prime. Because I feel like real person prime. It'd be less showing. But like he has so much to share. And he's just such a good human. Okay.

11:42:39
<transcript>: on another topic

11:42:45
<transcript>: On another topic. I got 1008. I think he does it on stream as I'm thinking about like he shares all that stuff.

11:42:45
<transcript>: it's

11:42:45
cowfacedev: there's FEM prime.

11:42:45
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: @imperialguard1 yeah, my dream of plowing the field with an ox is gone!

11:42:47
<transcript>: It's just like.

11:42:47
<transcript>: it's got

11:42:49
<transcript>: It's got.

11:42:49
<transcript>: the

11:42:56
<transcript>: The entertainment value and you could miss it, you know, you could miss it because of how entertaining he is when he's in his element on Twitch.

11:42:56
<transcript>: frag

11:43:01
<transcript>: Frag. On another topic. I got 1008 of his credits yesterday. Hey.

11:43:01
<transcript>: look at you

11:43:03
<transcript>: Look at you. Frag.

11:43:04
cowfacedev: those videos are much lower energy.

11:43:19
<transcript>: So you applied for activator something along those lines and you got your credits. I know you were doing that. Aj today is triggered Adam Day. Where is that? Where is dax of he's lower in the chat. I just. Oh, man, I'm more behind now. You guys started talking more just when I thought I was catching up.

11:43:20
thdxr: I'm here

11:43:22
<transcript>: Are you talking about Google.

11:43:27
<transcript>: That seems to be a form of self achievement, as if you were striving to become a skill developer working there.

11:43:47
<transcript>: I'd like to work at a fang, to learn how to work at scale, but then I might not get to wear multiple hats. So I don't know. That's a good point to vinda. If you work in a big company, you're definitely gonna learn things you won't learn at a tiny, early stage startup about how you service millions and even billions of customers. So there's definitely value on that. You'd learn a lot.

11:43:47
<transcript>: like i'm not

11:43:55
<transcript>: Like, I'm not trying to say if you make it to that and that's your goal, that it was a bad goal. Not at all. It just it does. Like.

11:43:55
sticklemepickle: What is the brand that makes the cute model city behind you?

11:43:58
<transcript>: It just. It's like a reflection.

11:44:00
<transcript>: Of like.

11:44:00
<transcript>: societal

11:44:01
<transcript>: Societal.

11:44:06
<transcript>: Pressures and desires that.

11:44:06
<transcript>: saddens me

11:44:09
<transcript>: Saddens me. It sends me that, like.

11:44:09
<transcript>: so many people

11:44:12
<transcript>: So many people would view that as a goal.

11:44:12
<transcript>: or that it is

11:44:16
fragaverage: Yeah, applied for Activate and that got approved pretty quickly. Scared myself with the AWS calculator though. Would be awesome to see a little 5 minute video on pricing small scale AWS services

11:44:16
<transcript>: Or that it is that for I mean, it should be I get it.

11:44:23
<transcript>: I'm trying not to come up too privileged here. I'm just too privileged this again. I'm not relatable. Don't listen to my takes.

11:44:23
<transcript>: i

11:44:25
fragaverage: @StickleMePickle They're Lego Modular buildings

11:44:27
<transcript>: I just think there's better jobs than working for a manga company.

11:44:39
<transcript>: Saying is not the pinnacle. Aspiring to be like people like carmac Tourval's. Okay, now that. Yeah, that's a good goal. Just like be one of the founding fathers of computer science.

11:44:42
<transcript>: Yeah, that's the pinnacle. I agree.

11:44:42
<transcript>: don't work

11:44:46
thdxr: my wife's cousin fell for the FAANG trap after graduating recently, tried so hard to convince him otherwise but he was brainwashed and saw it as the ultimate goal

11:44:47
<transcript>: Don't work at fang, please. Then saying this for years, it's more true today than ever. It so is.

11:44:59
<transcript>: It be what it do. No, it isn't. Okay, not a site. Well, it's a cool username. I actually read the whole thing. Not everyone's username. I can't read everyone's username. They're not all readable.

11:44:59
<transcript>: like j

11:45:02
<transcript>: Like Jflo 3000. I can read that.

11:45:06
<transcript>: Let's see.

11:45:10
j3sus_h: PowerUpL ending9Wormies PowerUpR

11:45:11

11:45:16
<transcript>: nicki mu

11:45:18
oleksii_lisovyi: I guess the key point Adam's trying to say is FAANG isn't necessarily the top of the pyramid. It's just an option.

11:45:19
thdxr: if anything work at FAANG when you want to slow down with your career, not at the beginning

11:45:21
<transcript>: Nicki muck. Note? Nick muck. I can read your username. Oh, look at this.

11:45:25
<transcript>: I don't know what I was thinking. Thank you. I couldn't read everyone's username.

lilfreezi: @j3sus_h hey sexc

11:45:31
folypill: do not read mine

11:45:32
<transcript>: Have I been talking for 45 minutes? Have we been having this little chat for 45 minutes? What am I doing? Do I start every stream like this.

11:45:35
<transcript>: I always spend 45 minutes just talking.

11:45:40
<transcript>: Never had the desire to work at thing. I like to hear that Taylor. That makes me feel better.

11:45:40
<transcript>: imperial

11:45:42
j3sus_h: @LILFREEZI STEP SON!

11:45:43
cowfacedev: 35 min...

11:45:52
<transcript>: Imperial Guard, the Industrial Revival Revolution and the consequences have been disaster for the human race. I think I agree with that. I don't know. I'm in kind of a depressed state right now. I'm being honest. Backs notice.

11:45:52
<transcript>: ovari gets what

11:45:53
j3sus_h: sedyWOAH sedyWOAH sedyWOAH sedyWOAH

11:45:58
j3sus_h: sedyWOAH mkoW mkoW mkoW mkoW mkoW mkoW

11:45:58
<transcript>: Ovari gets what I mean if people love a unique perspective, okay, well, I'll keep giving you a unique perspective.

11:45:58
<transcript>: good morning

11:46:00
<transcript>: Good morning. Seth. And data.

11:46:00
<transcript>: different

11:46:15
thdxr: @j3sus_h chill

11:46:20
<transcript>: Different lifestyle. Those are extra city where majority people likely are. Yeah. Different lifestyle. Like I've got I set on two acres, got Woods all around my house. We watch Dur and Hawks and Eagles and all kinds of animals just crawl around in our backyard, basically. And I don't think that's normal. If you live in a city, you don't see that stuff. So it's a different lifestyle for sure. I'm.

11:46:20
<transcript>: definitely

11:46:22
<transcript>: Definitely an indoors person.

11:46:30
<transcript>: So I don't take advantage of all the Rivers and caves and whatever you can do here in neo's arcs, but it's pretty. I like it.

11:46:30
<transcript>: if you share it

11:46:31
sticklemepickle: @StickleMePickle thanks! bloody hell... 200 bucks per building

11:46:32
thdxr: I have backyard animals too. possums, cats, gators

11:46:36
stroopwafel26: hellooooo

11:46:37
<transcript>: If you share it, people who identify it with it will Congress. So actually, basil, this I've 100% believe that.

11:46:47
<transcript>: And we're gonna adapt. Some are gonna record a podcast after this stream. We're gonna do it on dax's, stream on twitch. So we'll rate him so you won't miss it if you're if you're here.

11:46:47
<transcript>: we're gonna

11:46:51
j3sus_h: @thdxr mkoW mkoW mkoW

11:47:01
night_light90: you have to make a YT channel about the life there and make a small garden and vlog it , that would be awesome

11:47:02
<transcript>: We're gonna do a Pocket episode, and we're talking about dev streaming and watch dev and all this. And one of my thoughts is very much that that really anybody put yourself out there. And there will be people that resonate it's just how many people resonate with your personality and with who you are.

11:47:02
<transcript>: but

11:47:13
<transcript>: But if you just kind of like, put yourself out there and be yourself. It's all friend catcher's thing, like you'll find people that are like you that like the same things as you. They'll kind of find you. But if you don't put yourself out there like you won't.

11:47:16
<transcript>: So I'm very much in favor of.

11:47:22
<transcript>: Sharing as much as I was kind of like down on my relationship.

11:47:25
<transcript>: The name is from when I own the domain for a little bit.

11:47:25
<transcript>: but stop

11:47:32
<transcript>: But stop using it. Yeah, I got a lot of those. I felt like fang is more appealing for the don't live in the US is like.

11:47:32
<transcript>: the american

11:47:42
<transcript>: The americanization in Media movies. People want a better life. I see much of this in Brazil, people complaining and things that in US and other countries, they'll be better in life. Yeah, Yeah.

11:47:51
<transcript>: There's SIM prime. What's? What's? Oh, frontend Masters. Prime. Oh, Man. Yeah. Okay. So that cow face.

11:47:51
<transcript>: those

11:48:08
juniornascm: @thdxr LOL

11:48:12
<transcript>: Those are it feels more like a window in the actual prime. And I very much enjoyed his dsa course, like, it was fantastic. If you haven't watched prime's dsa course, it's free on frontend. Masters, you just have to sign up. And like, you've probably signed up like, a million things before, so don't give me the like, oh, I don't want to sign up because I don't want to have my email address. Who cares.

11:48:12
<transcript>: who

11:48:17
<transcript>: Who cares about people having your email address? I sorry I'm just really fired up today.

11:48:22
<transcript>: My dream of plowing. The feel was an oxygen gone.

11:48:42
<transcript>: I think that was sarcasm. I think maybe. I don't know. I'm not entirely sure I'm not the best at reading that those videos are much lower. Oh, I already read that dax is here. Clicks thank you for that follow. Thanks so much for the follow. Apply for activate. Got approved pretty quickly. Scared myself with a debit, though. Would be awesome to see a little five minute video.

11:48:42
<transcript>: on pricing

11:48:47
<transcript>: On pricing small scale A Tobis services. Yeah, frag don't use.

11:49:07
<transcript>: How do we help people like frag, who just should work with serverless stuff only. Okay, dax, my pitch. You guys need to make the thing I wanted to make yoked is what I want to call it, but just a thing that helps people start their aws account. Just make it part of ssd, like a button they can click and it launches the cloudformation thing or something.

11:49:07
<transcript>: and like

11:49:12
<transcript>: And like vins out a good AWS account that they can work with. Please make that.

11:49:18
fragaverage: YES PLEASE @thdxr

11:49:23
<transcript>: Dax, my wife's cousin fell for the fang Trap after graduating. Recently. Tried so hard to convince him otherwise, but he was brainwashed and saw it as the ultimate goal. Yeah, that just saddens me.

11:49:23
<transcript>: sheree

11:49:25
stroopwafel26: what's a "good" aws account? what does it include?

11:49:31
<transcript>: Sheree for the win. Thanks so much for that follow. I don't know why I said it like that shari. Probably like it could be cherry.

11:49:31
<transcript>: that's probably

11:49:33
<transcript>: That's probably Cherie.

11:49:34
thdxr: we are going to make an alternative way to create an AWS account

11:49:37
<transcript>: No, those are two eyes.

11:49:37
<transcript>: cheri

11:49:41
thdxr: eventually

11:49:45
<transcript>: Cherie. I guess the key point adam's trying to say is fang isn't necessarily the top of the pyramid. It's just an option. It's just an option.

11:49:45
<transcript>: and

11:49:46
aj_stuyvenberg: We automated that at serverless inc for what is now ampt. API-driven AWS account formation, good control tower config and policies around preventing cost growth.

11:49:56
thdxr: yeah exactly

11:49:59
thdxr: and SSO setup

11:50:02
<transcript>: And I think I'm just I'm really biased against big companies. And it's showing. And there you go. Just take everything I say to that lens. If anything, work at saying when you want to slow down with your career, not to be an engaged. Yeah. Yeah. You want to make a lot of money, do less work a thing. There you go.

11:50:03
lilfreezi: is it a bad goal to aim for faang early - stay for like 2 years - leave and get faang money anywhere else since its on ur resume

11:50:05
juniornascm: do you guys think aws certifications are worth it? in my job they are incentivizing to get one, but is too dam expensive

11:50:07
<transcript>: Message deleted by a moderator. What.

11:50:09
<transcript>: I miss something.

11:50:13
<transcript>: That's a good part about being behind on chat. My little sensitive.

11:50:19
<transcript>: Soul can be shielded from pars things that are said, but apparently.

11:50:19
<transcript>: there was something

11:50:21
<transcript>: There was something said that was deleted by a moderator.

11:50:27
stroopwafel26: @juniornascm when your employer makes you get them, they should pay for them

11:50:28
<transcript>: Folly pill. Welcome to Chat. Do not read mine. Sorry, I read it. Okay. 35 minutes.

11:50:30
thdxr: @lilfreezi yes it doesn't help you at the beginning of your career, just will slow you down

11:50:32
<transcript>: What? Thanks, the $200.

11:50:32
<transcript>: for building i

11:50:35
<transcript>: For building I gotta go faster.

11:50:41
<transcript>: Yeah. Possums, Cats, gator stacks. Oh, yeah. You live in Florida. So that is fun about Florida.

11:50:41
<transcript>: there are literal

11:50:47
<transcript>: There are literal dinosaurs in Florida, and we saw one. One day we wrote our bikes a lot in Florida, and we lived in new.

11:51:00
<transcript>: Grocery store. And there was a gator in between the two lanes of the highway, in the median, just down in the water. Chillin like, hey, look, that's thing could kill us, could eat us so fast. And our small children.

11:51:00
<transcript>: that's fun

11:51:03
<transcript>: That's fun about Florida.

11:51:03
<transcript>: seven messages

11:51:08
<transcript>: Seven messages were deleted by a moderator. I can't believe I missed it. There was Drama and I missed it.

11:51:10
thdxr: a good goal is to establish yourself enough so that 10 years in you can easily grab a FAANG job if you want a break

11:51:17
<transcript>: You have to make a YouTube channel about the life there and make a small garden and blog it. That would be awesome. Was that to me? Oh, in the ozarks. Okay. We do have a small guard.

11:51:17
<transcript>: hey

11:51:20
<transcript>: Hey, I can blog it. I have a lot of cameras.

11:51:30
<transcript>: Okay. Dax, thank you for taking care in other moderators. Thank you for taking care of whoever that was. And whatever they did, I appreciate it. I don't know what they did, but.

11:51:30
<transcript>: i

11:51:32
<transcript>: I kind of wish I knew what they did.

11:51:32
<transcript>: i kind of bummed

11:51:35
<transcript>: I kind of bummed, and I missed it.

11:51:35
<transcript>: what

11:51:36
lilfreezi: they werent crazy messages just emotes

11:51:37
<transcript>: What's a good AWS account. Great question, Street.

11:51:37
<transcript>: dax

11:51:41
juniornascm: @stroopwafel26 well, they will pay if i pass the exam, if i fail i have to pay, not a great move i know

11:51:43
<transcript>: Dax is gonna make a thing that'll just like, I think setting up SCPs.

11:51:43
<transcript>: and making sure

11:51:43
oleksii_lisovyi: @thdxr first ban BTW?

11:51:44
<transcript>: And making sure you can't.

11:51:45
<transcript>: use

11:51:53
thdxr: just s timeout

11:51:54
aj_stuyvenberg: @thdxr yup, bingo.

11:51:55
<transcript>: Use certain services that are really expensive, then you shouldn't use them because modern applications should be built other ways. That's what I think we are going to make an alternative way to create a native discount. Nice.

11:51:55
<transcript>: aj

11:52:07
<transcript>: Aj, we automated that at serverlessync for what is now amped. That's right. Api driven a Tobis account formation, go, control tower, config, and policy drum preventing. Yeah, yeah, I remember that. I do remember that. Aj.

11:52:07
<transcript>: and s

11:52:09
<transcript>: And ssl, setup.

11:52:09
<transcript>: i'm trying

11:52:29
<transcript>: I'm trying to read all this. I just. I it pains me not to read all the messages because you guys just stopped for a second. Just everybody. Just take a take a beat. Do we need to just time everyone out? Hey, dax, maybe just time everybody out. Let me just go ahead and let's just get everybody on a timeout so I can catch up. Okay, let's go. Is it bad advice to aim for saying early? Safer, like two years, leave and get thank money.

11:52:29
<transcript>: anywhere else

11:52:30
tayloreddev: turn on slow mode

11:52:30
lilfreezi: this is the break point dont read any after this

11:52:31
usernameisjim: writing a new message to add to the messages being read

11:52:31
stroopwafel26: SCP's should be pushed from an organization account, not set up in every new account. So I still don't know what a "set up an account" thing would do.

11:52:31
thdxr: do you guys think aws certifications are worth it? in my job they are incentivizing to get one, but is too dam expensive

11:52:33
oleksii_lisovyi: Ok, gotta go back to work. See ya. Have fun everyone!

11:52:37
<transcript>: Anywhere else, since it's on your resume. That's good advice. I think that's fantastic. That's a way to stick it to the big companies.

11:52:37
<transcript>: and all the

11:52:51
<transcript>: And all the other hiring people is to like, get it on your resume, play their dumb, stupid games. And like, look at my resume. I worked at fang. I made a bunch of money. Now I'm gonna make even more money because you're gonna pay me because I work. That's fantastic. I love any situation.

11:52:51
<transcript>: where the

11:52:53
stroopwafel26: @thdxr want a timeout dax?

11:52:56
<transcript>: Where the little guy, the individual is sticking it to the big guy, you know, I'm saying.

11:52:56
<transcript>: i love that

11:52:58
<transcript>: I love that.

11:52:58
<transcript>: do you guys

11:53:00
thdxr: FAANG is designed to trap you, hard to leave after 2 years once you get used to it

11:53:03
<transcript>: Do you guys think a Tobis certification is worth it in my job there incentivizing. To get one.

11:53:03
<transcript>: to accept it

11:53:09
<transcript>: To accept it. Well, if they're incentivizing you to get one of your job, you tell them you pay for it. I'll get one. That's how that works. Junior.

11:53:09
<transcript>: if

11:53:15
<transcript>: If you can tell your employer to pay for the cert, then it's worth it. Sure. Do it.

11:53:15
<transcript>: doesn't help

11:53:26
<transcript>: Doesn't help you at the beginning of your career just will slow you down. Good goal is to establish yourself enough so that ten years in you can easily grab a thing job if you want to break. That's probably better advice. Yeah, that makes sense.

11:53:36
<transcript>: They weren't crazy. Messages. Just emotes. Okay, well, they will pay if I pass the exam. If I fail, I have to pay. Not a great move. I know. Well.

11:53:38
up_o_lo_g: your opinion about layoffs v2 :D

11:53:40
<transcript>: So they'll pay if you pass the exam.

11:53:40
<transcript>: just

11:53:42
<transcript>: Just pass it.

11:53:42
<transcript>: just

11:53:45
<transcript>: Just like study really hard and pass it.

11:53:45
<transcript>: if

11:53:47
<transcript>: If you fail.

11:53:48
aj_stuyvenberg: that sucks, your company should pay either way.

11:53:49
<transcript>: They'll make you pay for it.

11:53:50
lilfreezi: just dont fail FiveHead

11:53:57
<transcript>: Interesting. That kind of sucks. But yeah, I guess like, they can't just pay for people to fail. A bunch. Maybe. I don't know.

11:53:57
<transcript>: small companies

11:54:00
<transcript>: Small companies, limited resources? Yeah yeah, I don't maybe.

11:54:00
<transcript>: first

11:54:03
<transcript>: First band just a timeout. Okay.

11:54:05
up_o_lo_g: By the way AWS introduced retake till end of 1st of aug

11:54:10
<transcript>: Turn on slow mode. Now. I don't want to do that to people. There's not enough of us to turn on slow mode. This is a breakpoint. Don't read any after this.

11:54:10
<transcript>: but

11:54:22
<transcript>: But there's a new chat. Welcome to Chat. Username is Jim writing a new message? Actually, your username is username. Is Jim just a technicality writing new message to add to the messages being read.

11:54:28
<transcript>: You people. This is what you doing to me. Now, this what we're doing.

11:54:28
<transcript>: sc

11:54:29
structuredchris: @usernameisjim omg hi welcome

11:54:35
<transcript>: Scp should be pushed from an organization account not set up in every new account. So I still don't know what a setup an account? Well, I meant set up an.org.

11:54:35
<transcript>: create an account

11:54:49
<transcript>: Create an account for your Dev and your prod. Just have a couple of accounts. You don't have to go crazy with it, but yeah, it's the level setup scp to eliminate whatever you don't want to use EC, Two, etc. Etc. Just never use a V PC. Basically.

11:54:49

statsndata: Lmao

11:55:33
<transcript>: Thing is designed to trap you hard to leave after two years. Once you get used to it, your opinion about layoffs version two yet it's not good. Things are looking bad out there. I'm not. I'm not a fan, not a fan of what's going on out there. You know, I'm saying got him, you sucker. Okay, so I got to do something real quick.

11:55:35
juniornascm: lmao

11:56:06
aj_stuyvenberg: narrating what he thinks adam is doing

11:56:07
<transcript>: Had some technical difficulties this morning.

11:56:12
<transcript>: I don't like having technical difficulties.

11:56:19

bu5ygiraffe: can i get your opinion on open back headphones versus closed? I've been considering making the switch to open

11:56:46
<transcript>: They are lit. I spent all time lighting them so I'm stalling because I'm just. I'm fixing some equipment issues.

11:56:46
<transcript>: when

11:56:49
<transcript>: When Adam is afk, dax should be able to voice over.

11:56:59
stroopwafel26: "they are lit" - Adam being gen z

11:57:00
<transcript>: Yeah, we should be able to pop dax in. Dax, you should have a button where you can just pop in anytime you want. Hey, I could probably make that happen. You could join the Pin call and then just like, hit a button.

11:57:00
<transcript>: and then there you go

11:57:01
<transcript>: And then there you go.

11:57:01
<transcript>: dax is here

11:57:08
<transcript>: Dax is here for a second. I thought you were making fun of you. Oh, no, Junior. What did I say? I wasn't making fun of you. I don't know if I.

11:57:10
<transcript>: What I said, but.

11:57:10
<transcript>: does it

11:57:32
<transcript>: can i get your opinion

11:57:35
<transcript>: Can I get your opinion? I can't believe I've been talking for an hour.

11:57:35
<transcript>: on open

11:57:45
<transcript>: On openback headphones versus closed. I've been considering making the switch open, so I just like these HG six hundred and fifty s. I don't know that I have an opinion on open versus clothes, but I will say.

11:57:50
night_light90: how many hours took you to complete this beautiful legos?

11:57:50
<transcript>: I have some clothes back that I hate and I never use them so I guess my opinion is.

11:58:26
<transcript>: Can't believe I talk for that long.

lilfreezi: @thdxr i had the same thought lol

11:58:28
structuredchris: ye but those look like considerably better open backs. what were the closed?

11:58:30
<transcript>: Can't believe I talk for an hour. Do I do this every day.

11:58:30
<transcript>: i feel

11:58:33
<transcript>: I feel like I do this every day.

11:58:46
<transcript>: This is not the end of the chat time. It is an illusion. How many hours to get you complete this beautiful legos. So me and my son did them. And there are one, two, three.

11:58:46
<transcript>: four

11:58:48
<transcript>: Four, five, six.

11:58:59
structuredchris: @thdxr he has a hook under his desk NOT MAGIC sadge

11:59:04
<transcript>: Four, five, six of them. There are six of them. And each one takes probably like three or four days for us because we can't just sit down and do it the whole day, like we have other things we have to do. And I'm.

11:59:07
<transcript>: Lettuce just build lego all day.

11:59:14
<transcript>: So. Yeah. Three. Four days each time. Seven times. Six. Three times. 618 days.

11:59:32
<transcript>: The CEO headphones. Are they good? Dax? I've heard good things.

11:59:42
thdxr: I love them, they're super comfortable

11:59:44
<transcript>: Stroop loves his AirPods Max. Well, maybe you should try some issues, cause I think compared to each other, these are way more comfortable. And I think they sound better. I don't know.

11:59:44
usernameisjim: if you're not a full-time lego builder you're doing it wrong LUL

11:59:47
structuredchris: are you still stalling?

Thank you for the follow milk shaker. I read your name, even though there were numbers instead of letters. Alright, let's actually do something. Geez, what am I doing? What am I? What am I doing today? Okay, we tweeted something earlier.

thdxr: I bought a new audio interface and Amazon is sending me 3 of them for some reason

12:01:40
thdxr: eventually consistency!

12:01:40
<transcript>: The prettier how I can avoid the white space issue. The white space issue being.

12:01:45
stroopwafel26: but i should've known that because adam owns them

12:01:50
<transcript>: It'll like, include new lines when prettier formats it, you know what I mean? It forms. It like it would format jsx. I feel like, oh, wait a minute.

12:01:52
<transcript>: Wait in a minute.

12:01:53
tsoutsou_proutsou: minify?

12:01:53
<transcript>: Wait a minute.

12:01:53
<transcript>: i think

12:01:58
<transcript>: I think I have a setting for this that's not prettier, that's.

12:02:01
<transcript>: Oh no oh no.

12:02:01
<transcript>: html

12:02:05
<transcript>: Html. Why space sensitivity? Is this? Did I break it.

12:02:05
<transcript>: did i actually break my

12:02:08
<transcript>: Did I actually break my prettier? Is that the problem.

12:02:10
statsndata: Adam do you happen to know which patched font you're using in nvim?

12:02:11
<transcript>: Maybe I broke it.

12:02:11
<transcript>: let's try without

12:02:13
thdxr: Adam you probably have more hours with astro and neovim than anyone in the world

12:02:14
<transcript>: Let's try without pretty or ignore now.

12:02:16
usernameisjim: it requires summoning cthulu

12:02:18
<transcript>: See, I didn't break it. It's gonna include those new lines. Now watch.

12:02:23
<transcript>: Yeah, see, now it's got all these new lines. It's so annoying.

12:02:26
<transcript>: I might have to I guess I might have to restart.

12:02:28
<transcript>: Something.

12:02:43
mecoupz: would love to know if thats an astro thing or prettier + astro or neovim

12:02:45
<transcript>: You probably have more hours with Astro and Neil them than anyone in the world. I believe that is true. I believe I've probably written more Astro in the oven. More astrophiles in the OFM than anyone in the world. You're watching the world's leader of riding Astro.

12:02:45
<transcript>: in the

12:02:46
opti_21: is it bracketNewLine?

12:02:47
<transcript>: In the Ovim.

12:02:47
<transcript>: i'm

12:02:47
mecoupz: thats annoying af

12:02:49
<transcript>: I'm kind of a big deal.

12:02:54
<transcript>: I don't know again. More cases that I'm not relatable.

12:02:58
<transcript>: Is it bracket New line? Oh.

12:03:01
<transcript>: Is that a setting and pretty can I change that.

12:03:01
<transcript>: so

12:03:03
<transcript>: So bracket.

12:03:03
<transcript>: same

12:03:08
<transcript>: Same line. Put the of a multiline HTML.

12:03:10
juniornascm: We need a plugin to show how much time you edited file by extension

12:03:14
<transcript>: At the end of the last line instead of being alone on the next line.

12:03:16
structuredchris: this is a stupid question but if you import a font into a react project through fontsource, does that make it default available on all browsers? so i dont need to worry about compatibility right?

12:03:16
<transcript>: What.

12:03:21
juniornascm: dont steal my idea!

12:03:23
<transcript>: Brackets. Spacing print spaces between brackets and object literals.

12:03:30
<transcript>: I don't know.

12:03:40
<transcript>: I don't know if that would do it or not. I need someone to figure this out for me because I am not smart enough and it is a daily pain. I will pay money for it.

12:03:43
<transcript>: Let's see. Welcome to Chat opd. By the way.

12:03:45
juniornascm: Adam: .astro -> 192391231923 hours

12:03:49

12:04:02
<transcript>: The Internet is amazing. Surprisingly expensive. Headphones out. Yeah. They're they're a little expensive. Do you have a way to drive them stroop.

12:04:05
nekitory: @juniornascm is called waka waka

12:04:06
<transcript>: Do you have an audio interface that can drive them? They're not Bluetooth.

12:04:11
<transcript>: Like you're gonna have to drive them off of some hardware.

12:04:14
thdxr: now he needs to buy more stuff

12:04:17
<transcript>: What have I done? What have I done to stroop? I mean.

12:04:17
<transcript>: i've just made

12:04:20
<transcript>: I've just made him spend too much money.

12:04:22

12:04:29
<transcript>: Suzu minify Adam, do you happen to know which patched font your using in them? Yes Operator, mono stats and data.

12:04:29
<transcript>: i love

12:04:31
<transcript>: I love.

12:04:37
<transcript>: Stats. I love the way you ask that question because you get me. You know how little I actually know about things.

12:04:37
<transcript>: and it's like

12:04:40
<transcript>: And it's like, do you happen to know.

12:04:40
<transcript>: what a

12:04:45
juniornascm: @juniornascm they stole my idea T-T

12:04:46
<transcript>: What a past fawn is or what yours is. That's the right level of questioning for me, because most times.

12:04:46
<transcript>: i don't have

12:04:58
<transcript>: I don't have that level of depth of knowledge. I do actually know, though, that this font is a patched operator, mono font. It's very annoying to patch it. I was not. I was not happy about it, that I had to do that, like.

12:04:58
<transcript>: i wish i was back

12:05:04
<transcript>: I wish I was back in vs. Code land at that moment when I had to do patching of my fonts like what is that.

12:05:08
<transcript>: Something.

12:05:17
thdxr: remember when Adam used vscode

12:05:21
basileus__: H.P Lovecraft

12:05:21
<transcript>: Wow. Reference. I feel like that was a raid boss. And wow, I feel like, seethulu, it's been a long time. I'll see soon. What is seethulu.

12:05:30
<transcript>: Love to know if that's an Astro thing or prettier or plus Astro or neovem. Yeah, I would like to know too. Mikoops, I'm not sure it could be any one of those combinations of things.

stroopwafel26: i have a simple focusrite scarlett 2i2 @adamdotdev

12:05:48
<transcript>: We need to plug in to show how much time you edited file by extension. Oh, interesting. That'd be cool. Like how much time have I spent in astrophiles? This is a stupid question, but if you import a font into a React project through font source, does that make it default available on all browsers? So I don't need to worry about.

12:05:48
<transcript>: compat

12:05:58
<transcript>: Compatibility, right? I don't actually know the answer to that question. I don't know why I Act like that was surprising. Of course, I don't know the answer that question. I don't know the answer to that question. Anybody know the answer to that question.

12:06:00
thdxr: I'm about to move off my focusrite Scarlett, great device though

12:06:00
opti_21: @juniornascm wakatime is great for that

12:06:04
<transcript>: Adam, astro, 1009, and that's a big number. That's not a thousand. That's a lot of hours.

12:06:08
statsndata: Been fighting my nvim to get icons working.

12:06:10
<transcript>: Nicotory, welcome to Chat. It's called Wakawaca. Oh, there is a plugin for that.

12:06:18
stroopwafel26: @thdxr whats your next one?

12:06:25
<transcript>: I do have an audio interface next to my large pile of headphones. Perfect stroop. So you already own a lot of headphones. Okay, I don't feel bad then. Like you needed another set. If you don't own some hg 650s, you need it. You know, I just did you a favor.

12:06:28
<transcript>: Adam wants to empty your wallet. No, I don't.

12:06:33
<transcript>: Remember when Adam use the s code I did used to use vs. Code. It was nice. I got a lot done.

12:06:41
thdxr: prosonus revelator, trying it out to see if it works well

12:06:44
<transcript>: I do. I love new of him. I love the tinkering. It's so fun. I don't love when it happens in the middle of something. I'm trying to do something. And it's like, now I have to tinker. Really tinker time. Okay.

12:06:45
thdxr: good for streaming

12:06:52
<transcript>: Hp love Craft Adam and pop Culture always delivers humor. I don't know much about pop culture.

12:06:52
<transcript>: you know

12:07:01
<transcript>: You know the focus. Focus, right, scarlet? Two, one, two. Okay, okay. I've heard of those. I'm about to move off. Focus, right, scarlett? Great device, though.

12:07:01
<transcript>: why

12:07:03
statsndata: Haha the camera cut feels like a larabar ad

12:07:08
<transcript>: Why don't I just keep reading chat? I'm just procrastinating. I don't know why I'm enjoying my work. I have a very fulfilling job.

12:07:10
<transcript>: You guys are so fun.

12:07:10
<transcript>: been fighting my

12:07:16
<transcript>: Been fighting my new of him to get icons working. Yeah, yeah? You gotta patch the font? You gotta patch that nerd font or something.

12:07:21
<transcript>: Nerd fonts patching. I remember those words. That's all I remember.

12:07:26
<transcript>: Proso sonus revelator. Trying it out, see if it works well.

12:07:31
thdxr: arch Linux has prepatched fonts for ez install

12:07:33
<transcript>: The camera cut feels like a larvae add. I have gotten a lot of people to buy Larabards if I'm being honest.

12:07:37
<transcript>: Out of another thing that I'm good at getting people to spend money on.

12:07:41
<transcript>: Our clinics has prepatched sponsor Easy Install. Are you serious.

12:07:41
stroopwafel26: you use arch btw

12:07:48
devinda_me: hhmmmmmmmm

12:07:49
<transcript>: I guess they know this. They know their users. So arch users are often going to be using things like Neil them and they need their patched on that makes sense.

12:07:49
<transcript>: you use arcs by the way

12:07:51
<transcript>: You use arcs by the way.

12:07:58
<transcript>: Yeah. I mentioned that I used arch, by the way.

12:07:58
<transcript>: i used

12:08:01
<transcript>: I used it. Okay, let's get to it. Nhl is next.

12:08:05
<transcript>: And in order to do NHL.

12:08:07
<transcript>: First of all.

12:08:07
<transcript>: we're just gonna delete

12:08:09
<transcript>: We're just gonna delete all this.

12:08:18
<transcript>: Because I'm going to copy from the latest from NFL, because I feel like NFL.

12:08:25
<transcript>: Has some things in it that NHL will also have. I don't remember what those things are because it was yesterday.

12:08:25
<transcript>: that's so

12:08:30
<transcript>: That's so sad. I literally don't remember what it was I had to solve yesterday.

12:08:33
<transcript>: Oh, what did I do.

12:08:33
<transcript>: i literally don't remember

12:08:35
<transcript>: I literally don't remember.

12:08:35
<transcript>: what

12:08:40
<transcript>: What was it? Nfl. No, no. Redo. In hl. Yeah.

12:08:46
stroopwafel26: i'm gonna have to find a way to tell my wife i bought another pair of headphones, any tips?

12:08:48
<transcript>: I don't remember. There was something we had to solve yesterday. And it was hard. It was hard. It was typescript. Something I don't know.

12:08:48
<transcript>: scoring summ

12:08:48
thdxr: yesterday was group by day

12:08:50
<transcript>: Scoring summary.

12:08:56
<transcript>: What is it on this one? Summary? No.

12:09:08
<transcript>: Grid. Oh, oh, this is still the NBA. That's the problem. Okay, so let's go to our Touch script file. This is the fun part. Yesterday was grouped by day. That's right. We had to group by.

12:09:08
<transcript>: that was fun

12:09:10
<transcript>: That was fun.

12:09:10
<transcript>: and that's fun way to tell my

12:09:13
<transcript>: And that's fun way to tell my wife. I bought another pair of headphones. Any tips.

12:09:15
statsndata: Tried pacman and yay installs, cleared the fc-cache. I feel like they're not appearing in regular terminal bash shell because I'm not using something like alacritty idk.

12:09:18
<transcript>: Yeah. My wife not a big fan of Gear, which is funny, because I own a lot of it.

12:09:18
<transcript>: no she's good

12:09:21
<transcript>: No, she's good with it. She just. She wants to see me use it.

12:09:21
<transcript>: and sometimes

12:09:27
<transcript>: And sometimes she thinks I'm just playing when I stream and I should make YouTube videos or something more productive.

12:09:34
mecoupz: tell her you bought tech stuff for tax reasons and she doesnt need to worry about it :D

12:09:35
<transcript>: I don't disagree but streaming so fun so here I am okay, tripac, man in Yay installs.

12:09:35
<transcript>: clear

12:09:42
statsndata: It's NBD really

12:09:45
stroopwafel26: I hope "adam did me a favor" works

12:09:45
<transcript>: Cleared the FC cache feel like they're not appearing in regular terminal bash shell because I'm not using something like alacrity. I do use alacrity sets and data for what it's worth, I use the lacrid.

12:09:48
<transcript>: So maybe that's the problem.

12:09:48
<transcript>: tell her

12:09:56
<transcript>: Tell her you bought tech stuff for tax reasons. You doesn't need to worry about it. It's no big deal. Really. I hope Adam did me a favor. Works.

12:10:03
<transcript>: I don't know if that's gonna work, if I'm being honest.

12:10:08
<transcript>: I don't know. Stupid know your wife, but that probably wouldn't work on my way.

12:10:08
<transcript>: well because i'm adam

12:10:11
<transcript>: Well, because I'm Adam. So that definitely wouldn't work.

12:10:15
cowfacedev: @thdxr so does nix. nix btw LUL

12:10:26
daglee: @statsndata And you patched your fonts?

12:10:34
<transcript>: So this is the one I got a change. Let's go down here. So there's MLB visual. We're gonna make a.

12:10:38
<transcript>: This is gonna be an NHL.

12:10:42
daglee: Most terminals don't support using multiple fonts.

12:10:44
stroopwafel26: i've never used arch but i look at their documentation a lot btw

12:10:47
<transcript>: Nhl visual the domain is going to be NHL. This is the fancy typescript stuff we did yesterday. Remember that was fun.

12:10:47
<transcript>: we did this

12:10:48
<transcript>: We did this.

12:10:52
<transcript>: Actually, this domain right here doesn't need to be here.

12:10:52
<transcript>: because i set

12:10:55
juniornascm: Last week i have a idea. use wsl to run kitty or alacritty  in wslg to use nvim in windows with tmux.  cant get the nerd font to work in wslg, sad day

12:10:56
<transcript>: Because I set it on the top level. Oh, well, it's nice. It looks nice. Whatever.

12:11:22
<transcript>: I gotta Yap it sometimes you just gotta Yap it you know.

12:11:27
<transcript>: So this is gonna be NHL.

12:11:32
cowfacedev: @statsndata it depends on your terminal. wezterm, alacritty and kitty are your best bet for trying out new fonts.

12:11:32
<transcript>: Oh, no. I have to do something.

12:11:37
<transcript>: I have to do something. I look. I don't look forward to.

12:11:45
<transcript>: It, but I'm gonna go ahead and do it. I gotta do it.

12:11:45
<transcript>: let's go back to

12:11:48
statsndata: @daglee I haven't patched them myself no. But I found nerdfonts dot come and the git repo to make sure I was getting legit downloads.

12:11:50
beeut: Hey VoHiYo

12:11:51
<transcript>: Let's go back to our NHL box score. Let's just log console, log.

12:11:51
<transcript>: json

12:11:53
<transcript>: Json that stringify.

12:11:53
<transcript>: beta

12:11:55
daglee: @juniornascm You can use fallback fonts in kitty.

12:11:55
<transcript>: Beta visual.

12:11:59
<transcript>: Data visual.

12:12:01
<transcript>: Undefined.

12:12:01
<transcript>: two okay

12:12:05
<transcript>: Two. Okay, I got to do that. And then we got to open up a game.

12:12:10
<transcript>: I hate when it does this. It puts that on the other screen. Okay.

12:12:13
<transcript>: This needs to be a hockey game.

12:12:18
<transcript>: Hockey match? Are they called Hockey match? Hockey matches? Did the broons went.

12:12:21
<transcript>: Here's a here's a hockey game.

12:12:26
<transcript>: Let's see. I don't know.

12:12:31
statsndata: @cowfacedev I'm running arch in an Proxmox LXC (similar to VM) so I had no other terminal or shell available besides the default out of the box and a system upgrade

12:12:35
<transcript>: That's interesting. This is actually an Ask page, but it's rendering the game recap and I wonder.

12:12:35
<transcript>: i'm gonna

12:12:37
<transcript>: I'm gonna have to do that.

12:12:44
<transcript>: But for now, I'm just gonna do this. I'm gonna go here.

12:12:44
<transcript>: pick

12:12:50
mecoupz: junior are u using the new microsoft terminal for wsl? that supports nerd fonts

12:12:51
<transcript>: Pick a game. Okay, now that's a game URL that I can copy. Okay, we're gonna have to handle that case.

12:12:51
<transcript>: so

12:12:53
<transcript>: So what do they have going on? They got this.

12:12:53
<transcript>: and that and then

12:13:00
<transcript>: And that. And then this. Oh, I just remember to gap on my baseball thing. I didn't put the lines here. The vertical lines between.

12:13:07
<transcript>: The innings and the runs. So I think mine's missing that. Yeah, I gotta do that. That's a bummer. Okay.

12:13:07
<transcript>: nh

12:13:09
<transcript>: Nhl.

12:13:09
<transcript>: here's

12:13:11

<transcript>: And.

12:13:12
<transcript>: oh

12:13:14
<transcript>: Oh.

12:13:14
<transcript>: it almost

12:13:17
cowfacedev: @statsndata you are logging in through ssh or vnc?

12:13:18
<transcript>: It almost works undefined. It almost works just like that.

12:13:20
juniornascm: @daglee i dont think will work. the fond load, but the special chars ale only a square

12:13:23
<transcript>: What? Okay, we should have logged something now.

12:13:24
daglee: @statsndata The idea with nerdfont is that you patch a normal font to nerdify it.

12:13:29
<transcript>: Sort of log something that I need, which is the game ID.

12:13:29
<transcript>: sorry

12:13:35
<transcript>: Sorry I'm ignoring you all in chat. You guys are probably. Are you talking to yourselves? Just keep talking to yourselves. Entertain yourselves.

12:13:48
<transcript>: Please, let's say that to my kids sometimes. Like, can you guys just, like, just entertain each other, love each other? Just be brothers. That like playing together for a little bit so I can just not.

12:13:55
<transcript>: I love spending time with my voice that sounded like I don't, I do, I love it. Game I. D. I'm looking for Game ID.

12:14:01
<transcript>: I don't see it. There it is. 65910.

12:14:05
<transcript>: 6591.

12:14:05
<transcript>: zero

12:14:06
<transcript>: Zero.

12:14:06
<transcript>: so we're gonna

12:14:09
statsndata: @daglee so can I not directly download Hack Nerd Font with the glyphs. Do I need to be supplying "the font" myself. I'm talking in terminology I don't know.

12:14:10
<transcript>: So we're gonna go over here? We're gonna go to NHL.

12:14:10
<transcript>: six what

12:14:11
tsoutsou_proutsou: hey @tsoutsou_proutsou how is going? (is it correct way) :D

12:14:11
thdxr: this stream is super cringe

12:14:12
mecoupz: adam have you looked at jsonhero.io for big json files?

12:14:13
<transcript>: Six. What was it? Six, nine, one.

12:14:13
<transcript>: five zero

12:14:18
<transcript>: 50? No, that's way off. Six, nine, one. No, I don't know.

12:14:18
<transcript>: i'm gonna hope it's in there

12:14:23
<transcript>: I'm gonna hope it's in there. There it is. 65910. Alright. X. Cute.

12:14:24
rsromano: It's at the end of the url

12:14:29
<transcript>: This stream is super cringe. Stop it, dax. You're not gonna make that a thing. Not gonna make it a thing.

12:14:29
<transcript>: j

12:14:33
<transcript>: Json. Hero I O for Big json Files I have not.

12:14:37
<transcript>: I have not looked at it, but I'm curious. What does it do.

12:14:44
cowfacedev: if it is ssh, than you should install patched fonts on your system. not the linux box. if it is not ssh. than you need to install them on the vm. @statsndata

12:14:53
<transcript>: What's going on? Be it. I'm just scrolling to see if anything needed my attention.

12:14:53
<transcript>: and something

12:14:58
<transcript>: And something did need my attention? And that is that beat is here.

12:14:58
<transcript>: be

12:14:59
<transcript>: Be it.

12:15:01
mecoupz: its a good json visualizer

12:15:03
statsndata: @cowfacedev I have access to the Proxmox terminal and I use Guacamole Apache reverse proxied to get into the machine over SSH /Html5

12:15:05
<transcript>: Into the URL.

12:15:05
<transcript>: oh what

12:15:08
<transcript>: Oh, what the game? Ids at the end of your.

12:15:09
daglee: @statsndata Yes. I'm currently using termite-nerd. It's the termite font + nerdfont.

12:15:17
<transcript>: Sorry that was weird last, but that's just so funny to me. I've gone through this pain for each of the four sports, and it was right there the whole time.

12:15:22
<transcript>: Thank you for knowing Statme's better than I do. I appreciate that.

12:15:22
<transcript>: rs

12:15:28
<transcript>: Rs romano. You're a real hero. It's a good json visualizer. Okay.

12:15:31
<transcript>: Let's see. Thank you for the follow.

12:15:35
<transcript>: A shivi Auste.

12:15:36
rsromano: Lol just noticed the same digits

12:15:42
thdxr: how are you guys gonna test this whole site

12:15:43
<transcript>: R chevy. Okay, we're gonna do this. We're gonna say, just notice the same digits. I appreciate that. So much.

12:15:43
<transcript>: i wish i

12:15:45
<transcript>: I wish I would have known that yesterday.

12:15:48
statsndata: @cowfacedev so on the LXC and in the docker container running Guacamole

12:15:49
<transcript>: How are we gonna test this whole side? Dax, here's what I'm gonna do.

12:15:49
<transcript>: what i'm gonna do

12:15:54
<transcript>: What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna set up some kind of harness that's gonna just pepper.

12:15:54
<transcript>: both sides

12:16:14
<transcript>: Both sides old and new with like, the same urls. Just take thousands of urls, and I'm gonna just nail them both sides with both of those sets of urls, and we're gonna compare, we're gonna dip the output, and then I'm gonna go through all the output and make sure that the diffs are what I expect, because some things are changing subtly. I just hope to not break like, meta Tags and things that important for SEO.

12:16:18
thdxr: gotcha

12:16:33
<transcript>: That's what I'm gonna do. It's gonna be a cross sample. It won't be all of the millions of pages. But that's my plan. I think that's the only way I can move forward and feel good about it. Like, it's a huge code base that we're just completely replaceing. And I'm not gonna be able to do that with confidence if I don't do something like that. Okay.

12:16:41
<transcript>: What am I doing? Downloaded a json file. Now I'm gonna go where I'm gonna open the json file.

12:16:44
<transcript>: Here it is.

12:16:44
<transcript>: show

12:16:48
<transcript>: Show and Finder we're gonna open it.

12:16:51
<transcript>: Open it with text. Mate.

12:16:55
<transcript>: And then I'm going to do this.

12:16:55
<transcript>: signal

12:16:56
stroopwafel26: all 116 of us are gonna click some links manually

12:17:00
<transcript>: Signalg. It's visual. It's not summary. It's detail. It's this one.

12:17:07
<transcript>: It's this one. We're gonna copy that. And now we're gonna go in here. Nope. Not in here.

12:17:09
<transcript>: Yeah.

12:17:10
statsndata: @daglee thanks, I'll try one of the AUR packages again, if no success, you have a resource I can follow or come back to as docs?

12:17:12
rsromano: What languages are you replacing and what was the impetus for the rewrite?

12:17:13
<transcript>: So I'm just gonna do like this.

12:17:14
<transcript>: And then.

12:17:18
<transcript>: Okay. Oh, no. What did I do.

12:17:23
<transcript>: Just trying to expand it. There we go. Did I actually get it? No.

12:17:26
<transcript>: Just like that.

12:17:31
<transcript>: Why? But why? Is that not.

12:17:34
<transcript>: Okay. There we go.

12:17:34
<transcript>: number

12:17:37
<transcript>: Number that can say like that.

12:17:37
<transcript>: this is

12:17:38
cowfacedev: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/font_configuration @statsndata

12:17:38
<transcript>: This is a team.

12:17:38
<transcript>: i believe

12:17:41
<transcript>: I believe it's the same? Yeah.

12:17:45
stroopwafel26: TIL you can now also do livestreams on LinkedIn, I bet someone likes that...

12:17:49
<transcript>: Same as all the others. So team same with that one. This is a Grid gamera grid.

12:17:49
<transcript>: team

12:17:58
<transcript>: Team detail. We've got home team goals. Okay, so these are gonna be a new hnhl thing. Player detail. Grids will be.

12:18:03
cowfacedev: @rsromano it is from nextjs-> astro.

12:18:08
<transcript>: Gamera Grid array. This is a is a string.

12:18:15
<transcript>: Also string also a gamera group array.

12:18:15
<transcript>: cool

12:18:24
<transcript>: Cool. Okay. Scoring Summary this. We have a shape for it's a little different because it's a period. So we're just gonna we're just gonna do, like a down the other ones.

12:18:24
<transcript>: we're gonna

12:18:26
<transcript>: We're gonna just do like this.

12:18:32
<transcript>: And just delete all these. Wow, a lot of scoring in this game.

12:18:35
cowfacedev: mainly for the improved performance in ssr.

12:18:35
<transcript>: Scoring.

12:18:39
<transcript>: All those.

12:18:42
<transcript>: And then this is Gonna be.

12:18:42
<transcript>: string

12:18:44
<transcript>: String.

12:18:44
<transcript>: string

12:18:48
<transcript>: String, string, string, number.

12:18:48
<transcript>: number

12:18:49
<transcript>: Number.

12:18:56
<transcript>: I like to format it like this. I don't know if it matters. Someone's it's smart could tell me. Is it the same.

12:18:56
<transcript>: that

12:18:58
<transcript>: That's the same thing.

12:19:05
<transcript>: Some of the stuff like that. It's not that. Oh, what I just do.

12:19:07
<transcript>: What I just do.

12:19:07
<transcript>: is it

12:19:09
statsndata: @cowfacedev thank you. So once on the LXC host machine with nvim. And also on the machine that I'm using to SSH INTO the nvim machine also?

12:19:10
<transcript>: Is it good? Okay. It's good.

12:19:10
<transcript>: it's not

12:19:11
daglee: @statsndata Not really. But updating the font cache might be needed and the nerdfont might have a new name.

12:19:21
<transcript>: It's not that you're smart, just someone who knows that stuff. People aren't smarter. Well, I don't know. Maybe there's a definition for that word. I don't know. But it's more that like you have experience. You've seen that before.

12:19:23
<transcript>: You know.

12:19:27
<transcript>: I stop saying smart people versus not smart people.

12:19:27
<transcript>: loon faria

12:19:29
<transcript>: Loon Faria think of that follow.

12:19:49
<transcript>: What languages are you placing? And what was the impetus for the rewrite? So I need to make a command for this because we do get this question quite a bit.

12:19:50
statsndata: @daglee gotcha. I'll give the whole machine a reboot

12:19:54
<transcript>: So.

12:19:54
<transcript>: it's there's

12:19:59
<transcript>: It's there's a lot. The main reason is like we're building a whole bunch of new stuff.

12:19:59
<transcript>: we

12:19:59
thdxr: https://twitter.com/davidbblocher/status/1638153299990831104?t=ztNZK1GWghVBvwaNI-gbmA&s=19

12:20:04
<transcript>: We're gonna build like a bunch of new functionality that we.

12:20:04
<transcript>: have

12:20:05
<transcript>: Have.

12:20:10
<transcript>: For like a subscription offering. Like tools for people who do research.

12:20:11
<transcript>: And.

12:20:11
<transcript>: it's a code

12:20:16
<transcript>: It's a codebase now that we don't have a lot of familiarity with, not a lot of people have elixir, experience.

12:20:16
<transcript>: so

12:20:20
<transcript>: So this is the existing code base was elixir.

12:20:20
<transcript>: but it was like

12:20:32
<transcript>: But it was like half server rendered, and then arbitrarily, we would render half of it as a react app inside of the part that server under it's just kind of like we met. We built it eight years ago, so like, we didn't make a lot of the best decisions.

12:20:32
<transcript>: we didn't know what

12:20:40
<transcript>: We didn't know what we were building. Even it was like we built it partially, partially as a spa. When it's just not. It shouldn't be. There's very little interactivity.

12:20:40
<transcript>: so just

12:20:46
<transcript>: So just bad choices, not bad choices, but like we couldn't have first seen what statme's become became.

12:20:53
<transcript>: Which is a site that just does like tons of Google traffic. We get lots of embossing from Google.

12:20:53
<transcript>: and

12:21:02
<transcript>: And astro is just a much better fit or PHP would have been. I mean, honestly, we could have built it. Php is just astros fun. It's typescript. And I like typescript.

12:21:02
<transcript>: so that's

12:21:04
thdxr: Twitter says rewrites are bad

12:21:08
<transcript>: So that's kind of the main thing is we want to have a stack that we are a little more comfortable moving forward fast with.

12:21:10
arielleparis: Do you ever feel uncomfortable coding on stream? I heard it's nerve racking

12:21:21
<transcript>: Rewrites are bad. That's true. Sorry that we rewrote. I feel like I need to apologize, everybody. That we rewrote it. Do you ever feel uncomfortable coding on stream? I heard it's. Nerve wracking. We're gonna talk about that. Actually, Ariel.

12:21:21
mecoupz: twitter says devs are obsolete too

12:21:22
usernameisjim: twitter needs to refactor though

12:21:28
<transcript>: In a podcast that we're recording right after this stream, we're gonna get on dax's stream, and we're gonna record a podcast. And we're gonna talk about.

12:21:28
<transcript>: whether

12:21:39
<transcript>: Whether you're ever feel uncomfortable coding. But I'll go ahead and answer you because that would be mean if I was like, You're gonna have to show up to find out. No, I don't get uncomfortable, but I would say this. I think I'm kind of weird.

12:21:42
<transcript>: I have weird.

12:21:47
<transcript>: Weird, weird brain. I don't know. I like, I don't feel a lot of emotions.

12:21:47
<transcript>: this

12:21:50
<transcript>: This is gonna sound really weird.

12:21:50
<transcript>: but

12:21:59
mecoupz: dont let your wife hear that adam lol

12:22:00
greetten: at what time is the podcast?

12:22:03
<transcript>: But like I literally have a very shallow emotional depth. So I don't know what that means. If that's personality, if that's upbringing is that some combination of all this things. I don't feel a lot of things. I don't feel them very deeply when I do.

12:22:03
<transcript>: so

12:22:06
horridweasel: ah autism.. i have autism

12:22:10
<transcript>: So I think that's probably why I don't care if you see my code? I've never once in my life felt like.

12:22:10
<transcript>: even

12:22:16
basileus__: I can relate

12:22:18
rsromano: Initially, I'd find it overwhelming, but the crowd sourcing of answers or to point out and stupid mistake and social aspect are all positives

12:22:19
horridweasel: thats very common for autistic people

12:22:24
<transcript>: Even when I first was getting started, it's just never been a thing that registered in my brain that, like, people might criticize my code to me. And I don't criticize other people's. It's just like it's coat. It's done. It all gets thrown away in, like two years. Who cares? You know what I'm saying.

12:22:24
<transcript>: none of this

12:22:26
<transcript>: None of this is gonna be here.

12:22:29
thdxr: "I don't feel a lot of emotions" *goes on an epic emotional journey from seeing another streamer*

12:22:43
<transcript>: In like a few years, let alone. And like, a hundred years. Just who cares? Like we're just trying to make stuff happen, just trying to build stuff. And I don't want to be flippant. And like, there's no reason for code review or there's no reason for it. Like, I get it. But like, I just don't care. Honestly, there's nothing I could do.

12:22:52
<transcript>: In a code file or in a project that I would feel subconscious about. And I think I just have a weird perspective again, not relatable. I'm not a very relatable person. I'm sorry.

12:22:56
thdxr: I love coding on stream but that's because I don't make any mistakes

12:23:08
greetten: i wish i didnt feel alot lol

12:23:09
am29d: what is going on, what is happening?

12:23:13
<transcript>: Horrid weasel. Thanks so much. I follow. I appreciate that. Follow so much. Twitter needs to refactor. Twitter says devs are obsolete. Two. That's true. They do say that. Don't let your wife hear that, Adam. Oh, no. My wife is the one that discovered this about me after we got married. Like you. Just don't. You're not a very deep person. She.

12:23:13
<transcript>: says you

12:23:16
vapor__dev: #psychologistdev

12:23:17
<transcript>: Says you don't have a lot of emotional depth, and it's true. I don't.

12:23:17
<transcript>: i mean i knew it

12:23:24
<transcript>: I mean, I knew it about myself. I'm just not very selfaware. Maybe it's because I don't have a lot of depth. I don't know at what time is the podcast it will be.

12:23:28
thdxr: yeah my wife describes me as simple

12:23:29
<transcript>: Half an hour gets us to eight, two and a half hours from now.

12:23:29
<transcript>: that way

12:23:29
fragaverage: did your wife call you shallow? LUL

12:23:38
<transcript>: That way I'll have to stay timezone. Also. Welcome to Chat. Greeting, welcome, welcome, also, welcome to chap horde, weasel.

<transcript>: autism

12:23:42
<transcript>: Autism? Is it autism? Do I have autism? I don't think I have auto.

12:23:47
<transcript>: I don't think I do. I think I have some things. I don't know what they are.

12:23:47
<transcript>: i have

12:23:52
<transcript>: I have some kind of abnormalities. I just don't know what the labels are.

12:23:52

12:23:57

12:23:58
manbravegg: @thdxr I make mistakes all the time, but that is all part of he journey.

12:24:08
manbravegg: the*

12:24:08
<transcript>: Initially I'd find it overwhelming, but the crowdsourcing of answers or to point out and stupid mistakes and social aspects are all positive. There are so many positives to streaming. I've learned so much.

12:24:08
<transcript>: so much fast

12:24:19
horridweasel: yeah theres many other traits but thats a very common one

12:24:19
<transcript>: So much faster than I would have like, there are so many things, Neil them. I would have taken me months to learn Neil them. But I feel like I learned in like two weeks because and that's including the vin motions. I didn't know vim motions.

12:24:19
<transcript>: like

12:24:21
thdxr: I was just kidding

12:24:25
<transcript>: Like I learned most of that super fast because of people like Calfhase here on twitch chat.

12:24:29
<transcript>: Da DA DA DA DA DA so I think the pros do way outweigh the cons.

12:24:29
<transcript>: very common

12:24:42
<transcript>: Very common for autistic people. Oh, interesting. Maybe I am autistic. I don't know. I don't like throwing that around because then people get upset. They're like, you can't just say you're autistic. You don't know your autistic. And I'm actually autistic. And I hate when people do that. And I'm sorry. I don't mean to make people upset. I really there's nothing in life.

12:24:42
<transcript>: that i want

12:24:48
<transcript>: That I want less than to make people upset. Honestly, I'm an enneagram type nine.

12:24:48
<transcript>: and i hate

12:24:51
mecoupz: my order comes on wednesday to make my iphone usable to stream

12:24:52
<transcript>: And I hate when people are upset with me. I hate it so much.

12:24:52
<transcript>: chocolate thank you

12:24:54
<transcript>: Chocolate. Thank you so much for that. Follow.

12:24:56
stroopwafel26: i've bought a lot of stuff since i started watching dev streams, not sure if that's negative or positive MaxLOL

12:25:03
vapor__dev: That larabel perfectl parallel to the keyboard FootGoal

12:25:03
onedabestyur: Is this a live video?

12:25:05
mecoupz: and if i really start streaming, i'll blame adam for everything :D

12:25:08
rsromano: You also don't even have to one what questions you're supposed to ask. People can just point stuff out. Like I just learned the yap combination in vim

12:25:12
horridweasel: tbf most autistic people start wih being self diagnosed haha i was officially diagnosed in 2021

12:25:13
<transcript>: And I think the only place where I'm kind of abrasive and sometimes I probably make people upset with me as Twitter. And I'm sorry if you follow me on Twitter. I'm just not very good at typing. When I write words, they sound really snooty. And I don't know. I don't feel a lot of emotions. Goes on an epic emotional journey from seeing another Street.

12:25:16
<transcript>: Yeah. Next. That one was that was unique yesterday.

12:25:16
<transcript>: i don't

12:25:18
manbravegg: @thdxr ahh ok lol. Thought you were a super elite grey beard coder :P

12:25:26
<transcript>: I don't even know if I was having a motions or if I was at I don't know what it was. It was something. I love coding on stream, but that's because I don't make any mistakes.

12:25:28
<transcript>: It's funny.

12:25:29
vimcerf: if people are upset with you on twitter, then you're just doing twitter right, right?

12:25:40
<transcript>: Am 29 D. What is happening? I don't know what is happening. Do you mean specifically, like what is happening on this stream? Because I know that it's an hour and 24 minutes in and I have not gotten much done. That is what's happening.

12:25:40
<transcript>: i've talked

12:25:41
<transcript>: I've talked a lot.

12:25:41
<transcript>: but

12:25:47
<transcript>: But do you just mean, like, what's going on? How's How's it going? Is that what you meant? Like more casual.

12:25:48
thdxr: "I don't want to make people upset" *tells Twitter they have bad personalities*

12:25:53
<transcript>: Allen's Here, psychologist dev. That's right. My wife describes me as simple.

12:25:56
vimcerf: LUL

12:26:01
<transcript>: That's funny, dax, that's I like that word simple. I think I'm pretty simple. I'm a simple guy. I have few needs in life.

12:26:01
<transcript>: did she

12:26:12
<transcript>: Did she call me shallow? Yeah. Kind of not the kind of shallow that most people mean when they say you're shallow, but like the more at your essence. Kind like you're shallow as a human being.

12:26:12
<transcript>: in your soul

12:26:15
<transcript>: In your soul you don't have a lot there.

12:26:15
<transcript>: she's not wrong

12:26:33
<transcript>: She's not wrong. First time chat. We're gonna check, man. Brave gigi. I make mistakes all the time. That is all part of your journey. Yeah. I think that's the thing. Like, I know I'm probably doing, like, every single thing I do when I code in a nonideal way, but I just kind of feel like that's all code, like, no one's really, like, setting down and doing it just right, you know? And honestly, it's like.

12:26:33
<transcript>: i just

12:26:48
<transcript>: I just. I don't care. I don't care if I do things inefficiently. I think that's something about my Dev personality is like, I'd rather just kind of, like, get something done than, like, perfect it. Maybe. Maybe not. I don't know.

12:26:48
<transcript>: i'm not self aware

12:26:49
<transcript>: I'm not self aware.

12:26:53
<transcript>: Many other traits. That's very common. One.

12:26:53
<transcript>: what were you just

12:27:03
manbravegg: always time for refactoring later.

12:27:03
<transcript>: What were you just kidding about? Ax. My wife should do simple. Oh, she does not really describe you as simple. That we were kidding about. My order comes on Wednesday to make my iphone usable to stream me coups are you streaming.

12:27:03
<transcript>: i am

12:27:07
<transcript>: I am so excited about new devs entering into the streaming world.

12:27:18
<transcript>: It's been a lot of fun for me, and I want other people to see if it would be fun for them. I don't think it would be fun for everybody. I don't think everybody wins it, but I think there's people out there that would really enjoy it to have it tried. And I hope they do.

12:27:18
<transcript>: coach

12:27:18
thdxr: was kidding and not making mistakes

12:27:22
manbravegg: I think getting something actually working is more important

12:27:22
<transcript>: Coach Ripkins, thank you so much for that follow.

12:27:26
thdxr: about

12:27:28
<transcript>: I've bought a lot of stuff and I started watching Dead Streams. Not sure if that's negative or positive.

12:27:33
<transcript>: That. Lara. Lara. Bar. Perfect.

12:27:33
<transcript>: parallel to

12:27:35
<transcript>: Parallel to the keyboard. Oh, is it.

12:27:35
<transcript>: it

12:27:38
<transcript>: It's actually a little off, and I'm kind of ocpd, so.

12:27:43
<transcript>: You know it's bothering me a little bit.

12:27:43
<transcript>: welcome to

12:27:50
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat One. Dabba Sheer. Is this a lot of video? This is a live video because I just read your message. And now I'm talking to you.

12:27:50
<transcript>: it's live

12:28:05
<transcript>: It's live. There's a delay because it takes me a while to read. I'm not the fastest of readers, and now you guys keep typing again. I gotta scroll faster. If I really start streaming, I'll blame Adam for everything. Do it. Mccooks. Please do it. Join. Watch. Dev.

12:28:08
<transcript>: You also don't even have to watch.

12:28:10

12:28:23
tayloreddev: Many software engineering teams don't have time to do it right.  But surprisingly, they have time to do it twice.

12:28:28
<transcript>: What questions you're supposed to ask? People can just point stuff out. Like, I just started learning the app combination vim. It's so true. Rs romano like, you don't even have to have the right question. You don't even have to be smart enough to ask good questions. You just do something on twitch, and people will tell you how them you are and they'll fix it. They'll tell you how to do it the right way. They don't do it. That like that. They don't say you're done, but they just like, hey, did you.

12:28:28
<transcript>: know you could save like

12:28:42
<transcript>: Know you could save like 15 keystrokes if you just hit ya Yap like that would save you a lot of time. Like wow, that's amazing. And then you just keep doing it. You keep doing stuff in front of them and they keep showing you better ways. Am 29 D thanks so much that follow.

12:28:45
gerellt: if i learned vim, i'd probably do it on stream haha

12:28:47
<transcript>: I really got to take some more time to thank you people for your follows.

12:28:50
thdxr: I'd rather have a thousand tries than be a genius with one

12:28:52
<transcript>: I just said, you people, Did anyone get offended when I said you people.

12:28:52
<transcript>: i gotta take

12:28:53
mecoupz: what is yap doing on vim?

12:28:56
<transcript>: I gotta take the time to thank you people.

horridweasel: very hard to offend me

12:29:04
<transcript>: I didn't mean it like that. Schumac. Thanks so much that follow. See, that's what I mean. This is exactly why I came over here. Because I just. I it's like.

12:29:04
<transcript>: so

12:29:05
<transcript>: So.

12:29:09
stroopwafel26: @thdxr do both

12:29:13
<transcript>: It's so burned into my brain. Now that when I see a follow, I say, thank you so much for that follow. And it starts to become kind of meaningless. I feel like.

12:29:13
<transcript>: eventually

12:29:37
<transcript>: And this goes for all of you. I really, genuinely appreciate that you followed me. You clicked the button. It was free. But you click that button. And you followed me because I think.

12:29:37
<transcript>: you want to

12:29:45
overra_dev: @adamdotdev clone ur voice and automate it

12:29:46
<transcript>: You want to come watch me again? That's the only thing I like I've set and thought about this. I've literally thought about this. Probably in the shower. That's, like, the only time I think in my entire life.

gerellt: If you ever see adam IRL, play that sound and see if he instinctually says "thank you for that follow"

12:30:05
basileus__: the follow alert sound should be a voice clip of you saying thank you LUL

12:30:06
<transcript>: But I thought about the fact that people follow me and why. And I tried to figure out I'd needed to know why would I follow someone? And I think the best I can come up with is I want to know when this person does this again. I want to know when they stream again, because I want to watch again. And I really like to think that some of you that follow will come back again.

12:30:08
<transcript>: Maybe most of you I don't even know.

12:30:08
<transcript>: but

mjewl: @opti_21 primeagenWorstMod

12:30:19
lezomy: what font is on  "+1" in the follow alert?

12:30:29
<transcript>: But that means when I stream tomorrow, there will be more people here or the same number of people. But you'll be here and you'll be hanging out. And I feel like it's like the start of our friendship. When you follow me, it's like I want to get to know you better, and I want to get to know you better. So I'm very excited. Okay. I went over the top a little bit. This was a little overdone opty. Thank you so much for the tier one sub.

12:30:29
<transcript>: genuinely

12:30:33
<transcript>: Genuinely from the depths of my very shallow soul.

12:30:33

opti_21: @mjewl opti21Hi

12:30:58
<transcript>: Hannah. Hannah foo, thank you for the follow. Really? Truly. Should I do that every time someone follows me? Should I just come over to this camera, stare into your eyes, and tell you how much I appreciate you as an individual. Would that be too much? We would definitely not get anything done. Well, no, we probably would, because people would stop following.

12:31:01
<transcript>: It would creep people out, and they would just stop.

12:31:01
<transcript>: so that's

12:31:03
<transcript>: So that's one approach.

12:31:09
mecoupz: you should rename from adamdotdev to adamdotshallow or adamshallowsoul :D

12:31:10
<transcript>: I want to slow down the follow stream. I'm just gonna I'm gonna come over here every time. I don't know what I came over here. Why am I here.

12:42:08
<transcript>: Oh.

12:42:28
<transcript>: Watching my own boss, and I got confused. Dax, I'm offended. I'm not really offended. This is so many layers of inside jokes that I feel bad sharing it on stream because I feel like anyone watching right now is completely lost. I'm gonna actually catch you up because it's worth it. Welcome to chats poop Sound Artists, objective.

12:42:46
<transcript>: I love that. That's a great response to me criticizing your username. Okay, you did. You're welcome. Glad to catch you stream again. Oh, good. I said it twice. You deserve it twice. I'm glad to see you here because I took a break from streaming. Okay, so I'm going to explain the layers of this joke. There's not that many.

12:42:50
<transcript>: So you yesterday. I had a bit of a breakdown.

12:42:54
<transcript>: Next call it a manic episode, and that's not the first time.

12:42:54
<transcript>: first

12:43:09
horridweasel: lmao

12:43:15
<transcript>: First time someone said I've had manic episodes. I know dax was joking. It might be true. I might be a manic depressive? I don't know. Someone else could tell me if I'm a minute. So I need to know in my autistic and my ADHDor manic depressive or some combination of all of them. I think I'm ADHD AC, no, ocpd, I think I'm that, but I need it from the other thing, too.

12:43:17
horridweasel: so autism meltdowns are a thing

12:43:17
nikolaxhristov: you're finee

12:43:19
nikolaxhristov: :D

12:43:30
<transcript>: So I had this episode yesterday where I saw somebody on Twitter. It was like I was just perusing other software devs, because sometimes when I get them streaming, I like to just watch other streamers, you know. And I found this streamer.

12:43:30
<transcript>: who

12:43:33
<transcript>: Who just felt like a caricature of me.

12:43:33
<transcript>: does that make sense

12:43:34
horridweasel: but again idk take the test and youll see if you match more traits

12:43:35
<transcript>: Does that make sense? It felt like.

12:43:35
<transcript>: if i

12:43:44
<transcript>: If I were the worst possible version of myself and that's very mean to say, but I'm not gonna tell you who this person is, so it doesn't matter.

12:43:46
fragaverage: The internet cannot tel you, they'll say you have arthritis or something

12:43:49
<transcript>: It just felt like all of my worst, like characteristics. All the things that kind of bother me about myself.

12:43:49
<transcript>: exaggerated

12:43:52
<transcript>: Exaggerated to the nines, like it was just like.

12:43:52
<transcript>: this person

12:43:53
horridweasel: of course whenever you wish to no rush but yeah it sounds like it

12:43:55
<transcript>: This person was some embodiment.

12:43:55
<transcript>: i told

12:44:00
<transcript>: I told dax it was. He watched him. Says it doesn't remind him. All of me. So I'm probably just like, doing something else.

12:44:00
<transcript>: where

12:44:07
vapor__dev: Was it vapor__dev?

12:44:12
stroopwafel26: @FragAverage yeah, it's always 2 months to live

12:44:17
<transcript>: Where my brain is doing that to me. It's like a trick. It's not really. I'm just seeing what I want to see or something. I don't know. Anyway, I did that and I just can't kind. I got kind of depressed. I was like, I don't know if I want to stream anymore because I feel like that's what I look like. And I don't want to be cringy like that on the internet.

12:44:17
<transcript>: so i'm telling

12:44:18
<transcript>: So I'm telling dax all this.

12:44:18
<transcript>: and then let's see

12:44:23
<transcript>: And then let's see what happened. So I put a message out there this morning.

12:44:23
<transcript>: like

12:44:29
<transcript>: Like asking anybody ever to do this. It was like a dumb joke, cause it's like oddly specific. Obviously, nobody has done it.

12:44:29
<transcript>: but

12:44:45
<transcript>: But David says, are ruthless. Dax subtweet. Like I was watching dax. And that's when I had these revelations, like dax was the other streamer that made me feel so awful about myself. So that was that was Davis joke. And then dax says, Adam was actually just watching my own vods. And I got confused.

12:44:45
<transcript>: another

12:44:53
tayloreddev: last time i asked the internet for medical advice it said i was pregnant LUL

12:44:55
thdxr: this was really funny once it was explained

12:44:57
<transcript>: Another joke. So you guys with the jokey? Jokes. He had virtual gradual Mars glasses, superimposed medication to time. You guys are funny. David dax, you're funny. I just wanted to explain the joke. Okay.

12:44:58
horridweasel: i just redid the test i got 29 XD

12:45:01
horridweasel: oh boy

12:45:02
<transcript>: The Internet cannot tell you say you have arthritis or something.

12:45:07
vimcerf: I'm pretty sure Dax and David won the Internet

12:45:12
<transcript>: Autism meltdowns are thing. Thank you, horrid, you're just more evidence that it's probably autism. Okay.

12:45:24
<transcript>: I feel like I would have known, though in life, if I have autism, I feel like I would have known that by now. Is it common to you said it was selfdiagnosed a lot. Okay. So maybe I just went 36 years and didn't know it.

12:45:27
horridweasel: im 25 i got diagnosed when i was 23

12:45:28
<transcript>: Take the test to see if you match. We'll see we will see.

12:45:40
horridweasel: totally common for aspergers / autism level 1

12:45:40
<transcript>: Whenever you wish. No rush. Sounds like it okay, Horizon. You do sound kind of like a psychologist. Like you're very good at delivery. Like no rush. Just take your time whenever you feel comfortable.

12:45:40
<transcript>: i'd like you to take

12:45:41
<transcript>: I'd like you to take the test.

12:45:45
horridweasel: HA

12:45:59
<transcript>: I'm going to take the test. Was it vapor dev? It was not Alan. It was not you. It was not. Oh, no, Alan. You know, I watched some of your stream yesterday because I popped in chat. That's funny. It was not you. Why are we watching my face twice? We're watching my face on here. And you guys are watching it over here.

12:45:59
<transcript>: we don't need

12:46:05
<transcript>: We don't need to do that. Let's actually somebody send me something. Send me something on Twitter. That's good. Anybody, please.

12:46:10
<transcript>: Last time I asked the internet for medical device said it was pregnant.

12:46:10
<transcript>: it's funny

12:46:11
<transcript>: It's funny.

12:46:12
horridweasel: not a psychologist just get obsessed with things and researrch them to the brim

12:46:25
fragaverage: @TayloredDev How long ago?

12:46:31
<transcript>: This is really funny. Once it was explained. Yeah, it was. It was so much funnier when it was shrouded in mystery. Dax, I'm sorry I made you joke. Kind of not funny by explaining it. Maybe that was my goal. Maybe I was trying to make it not very funny because I was a fan. Did I just read the test? It got 29 out of what? Horrid, how high does it go? Does it go to 30.

12:46:33
greetten: "These results indicate that... you experience many typical signs of autism." should i see a doctor?

12:46:35
<transcript>: Pretty sure dax and David won the internet.

12:46:38
horridweasel: out of 30

12:46:43
<transcript>: I'm 25. I got diagnosed when I was 23. Okay, so totally common. For as bigger Asperger's autism. Level One. Okay.

12:46:43
<transcript>: not psychologists

12:46:47
<transcript>: Not psychologists to get obsessed with things and research them to the brim. Me too.

12:46:56
horridweasel: THERE YOU GO

12:46:57
stroopwafel26: DO THE TEST @adamdotdev

thdxr: wow the camera zoom worked!!!!

12:47:04
<transcript>: I research things as far as you can possibly research them. And I'm very obsessive. Like, I don't know anyone more obsessive than me. Maybe that doesn't come across on my streams, but I am extremely obsessive.

12:47:04
<transcript>: i'm obsessed

12:47:06
<transcript>: I'm obsessed with how obsessive I am.

12:50:09
thdxr: the world is dumb these days

12:50:10
<transcript>: No, not cancel for being autistic like people might think I'm making fun of people taking tests or something. I don't know if you could pull out of context.

12:50:13
<transcript>: All that for you in front of the cancel people. Okay.

12:50:17
<transcript>: I'm not actually worried about getting canceled.

12:50:19
<transcript>: It's more of a bit.

12:50:19
<transcript>: but

12:50:24
<transcript>: But I'm gonna take the test while we're talking here while I meet my larvaar.

12:50:28
thdxr: I took that test and I got the lowest score within the autism range

12:50:29
vapor__dev: adamdo8DealWithIt

12:50:30
<transcript>: Now this first question stuff. Because.

12:50:32
dnbull: but cancel culture is not real LUL

12:50:36
<transcript>: You got the lowest score within the autism range.

12:50:42
<transcript>: So here's the first question. I prefer to do things on my own rather than with others.

12:50:46
<transcript>: I would normally say yes, but I do love streaming on Twitch.

12:50:46
<transcript>: and that

12:50:51
<transcript>: And that would be choosing to do something I could do alone with others.

12:50:51
<transcript>: do i actually

12:50:53
<transcript>: Do I actually prefer doing it with others.

12:51:02
<transcript>: In my whole life, I've definitely preferred doing things alone like I'm I'm introverted. I enjoy I get energy from being alone.

12:51:04
<transcript>: But.

12:51:04
<transcript>: something about

12:51:05
nikolaxhristov: edge cases

12:51:05
thdxr: I can see how this is gonna go

12:51:06
<transcript>: Something about twitch. Streaming.

12:51:06
<transcript>: at least

12:51:11
thdxr: massive indecision on each question

12:51:11
<transcript>: At least an intense bursts I really enjoy? I can see how this is gonna go? Oh, boy.

12:51:11
<transcript>: edge

12:51:13

12:55:02
<transcript>: If I find it upsetting if my daily routine is upset or changed.

12:55:05
<transcript>: It's given.

12:55:05
<transcript>: other people's

12:55:07
<transcript>: Other people's Facebook expression body language.

12:55:15
<transcript>: I don't have any problems making small talk with new people.

12:55:21
<transcript>: Because you guys tell me when you're new to my channel. Do I have a problem making small talk.

12:55:27
<transcript>: Question for do you have more than three AWS first. Yes. You can skip to the end.

12:55:31
<transcript>: I don't know why my a Tobia search.

12:55:33
nikolaxhristov: chit chat

thdxr: you're good at small talk

12:55:37
zryqv: yes i dont like how youre looking at my soul

12:55:39
thdxr: you're from the midwest

12:55:46
<transcript>: Would mean that I'm autistic. But I appreciate that joke. That was a good one more for real life. Oh, for more. Okay. I'm good at small talk. Am I? I am from midwest. I think I'm good at small talk. Zach, I think it's true.

12:55:53
<transcript>: I think it's true. I noticed very small changes in a person's appearance.

12:55:56
<transcript>: Do I.

12:56:03
<transcript>: Think so.

12:56:07
<transcript>: Don't think so.

12:56:07
<transcript>: when

12:56:09
<transcript>: When I was young.

12:56:13
<transcript>: Basically lots of let's pretend or imagining games.

12:56:26
<transcript>: How many questions are there? 30.

12:56:36
<transcript>: You don't look like I'm looking at your soul. I'm sorry. And do look straight into your eyes, don't I.

12:56:44
<transcript>: People close to me say I talk about the same thing repeatedly.

12:56:46
thdxr: like all psych tests it's like "do you do this thing that a lot of people do?" THAT MEANS SOMETHING

12:56:48
<transcript>: Easy to work it out, what people are thinking.

12:56:56
<transcript>: Thank you graphio for the follow.

12:56:56
<transcript>: we're

12:57:02
<transcript>: We're gonna be getting back to coding, I promise. Astro. Even very soon.

12:57:02
<transcript>: very

12:57:03
<transcript>: Very soon.

12:57:07
<transcript>: I'm just taking a test to see if I'm autistic.

12:57:11
<transcript>: That sounds. I don't know why that sounds like.

12:57:11
<transcript>: that's not a joke

12:57:12
<transcript>: That's not a joke.

12:57:12
<transcript>: honestly

12:57:16
<transcript>: Honestly, we think I might be and I'm gonna find out.

12:57:16
<transcript>: it's important

12:57:19
beeut: What's your 16personalities test type?

12:57:19
<transcript>: It's important to me to carefully plan my inning activities. I'm going to do.

12:57:23
<transcript>: Hard to work out with people's intentions are.

12:57:28
<transcript>: I would find it really hard to play imaginary games with children.

12:57:32
stroopwafel26: and other bs tests

12:57:33
<transcript>: I'm a good diplomat.

12:57:36
<transcript>: Can I go back to that one.

12:57:36
<transcript>: can i go back

12:57:38
<transcript>: Can I go back.

12:57:40
<transcript>: Oh no.

12:57:40
<transcript>: and i just

12:57:52
<transcript>: And I just stuck. I can't go back to that one. I need to change it. I got it wrong. I know, I know, I answered that one wrong. Oh, well, good diploma. Matt can help ease difficult social or work situations.

12:57:55
<transcript>: Often the last person to understand a joke.

12:57:58
<transcript>: I like doing things spontaneously.

12:58:04
<transcript>: If I'm interrupted doing something, I find it hard to get back to what I was doing beforehand.

12:58:08
<transcript>: I know this patterns and things all the time.

12:58:18
<transcript>: Some various strong interests and get upset if I can't pursue them.

12:58:21
<transcript>: I can tell someone I'm talking to is getting bored.

12:58:26
<transcript>: My wife says I'm terrible about this.

12:58:31
horridweasel: HA

12:58:31
<transcript>: So I got a 21. There's a strong probability that I am autistic.

12:58:31
<transcript>: my

12:58:37
<transcript>: My wife says I'm awful about just like going on and on about something when no one's interested.

12:58:37
<transcript>: oh

12:58:39
<transcript>: Oh, Twitch.

12:58:40
thdxr: I got a 21 too lol

12:58:40
horridweasel: I KNEW IT ABOVE 20

12:58:48
stroopwafel26: lol almost the same test score

12:58:53
<transcript>: No one can, like, tell me that they're not in her or you could you could type in chat, but like, there's no face here to be, like, clearly uninterested. I wouldn't notice if there was, but I just go on and on. I guess that we're gonna.

12:59:02
<transcript>: Tweet. Does it work? I knew it about 20. We knew it. Horde, you got a 21. Two. Dax. Hey, let's talk about it on our podcast.

12:59:07
barryxbtw: it works yes, your vibe is the stream

12:59:08
<transcript>: Like all site tests. It's like, do you do this thing that a lot of people do.

12:59:08
<transcript>: that means

12:59:10
<transcript>: That means something.

12:59:15
<transcript>: Oh, man, my.

12:59:16
horridweasel: also if you were gonna answer that you suck at imagine games with kids

12:59:19
<transcript>: Court got into my chair that bothers me.

12:59:20
fragaverage: is the podcast live?

12:59:23
horridweasel: then your score would be higher

12:59:26
<transcript>: Okay. What's your 16 personalities test type? I don't know. I'm an enneagram type nine.

12:59:26
<transcript>: my wife

12:59:29
<transcript>: My wife said to India, Graham, That's the only one I know.

12:59:35
<transcript>: Almost the same time test score.

12:59:35
<transcript>: we both

12:59:36
devinda_me: i got slight tendencies xd

12:59:36
thdxr: we're going to record live today

12:59:36
horridweasel: personally as a kid i hated play pretend

12:59:39
<transcript>: We both got 21. So we got the exact same score.

12:59:39
<transcript>: it works

12:59:42
<transcript>: It works. Yes, your vibe is the stream.

12:59:42
<transcript>: your vibe

12:59:42
stroopwafel26: wait you answered one wrong, so the score is actually 20 or 22 depending on the answer

12:59:44
<transcript>: Your vibe is the stream.

12:59:45
thdxr: I'm gonna really be pushing Linux audio to the max

12:59:53
<transcript>: Is the Stream vibe? Good. Also, if you were gonna answer that you suck at Imagine Games with kids.

13:00:01
<transcript>: Then your score would be higher. I was going, yeah, I'm terrible. I'm actually just bad at playing with kids. Now my kids.

13:00:01
<transcript>: i love

13:00:09
<transcript>: I love my kids, dearly. And so I think it's different when I'm playing with my kids. We have such a good relationship, like we love each other.

13:00:09
<transcript>: and

13:00:25
tayloreddev: I've no idea how to really interact with other peoples kids

13:00:27
<transcript>: And I enjoy playing with them, but I'm just bad at playing with kids. Like, I just it just bought it's like I can't work with people who are illogical in children are just completely illogical. Like, if you don't have, like, some sense in your brain, it's very hard for me to work with you and play with kids.

13:00:27
<transcript>: there

13:00:34
<transcript>: There's no sense. It is all nonsense. And it's very hard for me. So I needed to go back and change that one. Because.

13:00:34
<transcript>: i answered

13:00:39
beeut: LUL

13:00:40
vimcerf: "Kids are so stupid!" - Adam

13:00:44
vimcerf: Kappa

13:00:44
<transcript>: I answered wrong as I thought about it more. I'm terrible at, like imagineing or playing with kids. It just feels I don't know. It feels like it's very out of my element or something.

13:00:48
<transcript>: We're gonna record Live Today. It is gonna be Live today.

13:00:50
<transcript>: Okay.

13:00:50
<transcript>: the vend

13:00:53
<transcript>: The Vendor Slight tendencies.

13:00:53
<transcript>: personally

13:00:53
kryotoboi: Now I wanna see what Adam says after working with me.

13:00:59
<transcript>: Personally, as a kid, I hated playing pretend. I don't remember as a kid like how much I played pretend. But I know as an adult.

13:00:59
<transcript>: it's just hard for

13:01:00
kryotoboi: Beyond illogical LUL

13:01:06
horridweasel: btw that score means you are most likely autistic you can go ahead and say you are cuz official diagnosis is very expensive

13:01:09
<transcript>: It's just hard for me to play with kids. I've always felt like, oh, this is why they say some people are good with kids. I'm not good with kids, but I love my kids. I'm just not good with kids.

13:01:13
thdxr: you're playing pretending to work rn

13:01:14
<transcript>: You answered one wrong, so score is actually 20 or 22 depending on the answer. Yeah, it's true.

13:01:20
<transcript>: Really be pushing linux audio to the Max ooh on our stream today. Yeah. You're gonna be streaming.

13:01:20
<transcript>: and you're

13:01:23
<transcript>: And you're gonna be recording a podcast.

13:01:31
<transcript>: I don't have high hopes I've known idea how to really interact with other people's kids. Yeah other people's kids. I am hopeless. Kids are so stupid.

13:01:31
<transcript>: i

13:01:33
<transcript>: I didn't say that.

13:01:39
<transcript>: I want to see what Adam says after working with me beyond illogical.

13:01:43
<transcript>: That score means you're most like autistic. You can go ahead.

13:01:48
<transcript>: And say you are because official diagnosis is very expensive.

13:01:54
<transcript>: I'm playing pretend to work right now.

13:01:54
<transcript>: that's exactly

13:01:57
<transcript>: That's exactly right now let's actually work.

13:01:57
<transcript>: let's

13:02:01
barryxbtw: diagnosis is free here

13:02:03
<transcript>: Let's actually work if I can find my foot pedal and bring us back over here.

13:02:03
<transcript>: okay

13:02:07
barryxbtw: les go universal healthcare

13:02:13
<transcript>: Okay, so we didn't do the Twitter thing. It turns out there's nothing to talk about on Twitter. Let's actually work. We could actually work today. We want to do that. Let's do it. We're gonna actually work.

13:02:19
<transcript>: Okay. So today I learned that montistic.

13:02:19
<transcript>: we

13:02:21
<transcript>: We thought my wife might be autistic.

13:02:23
devinda_me: i did go ahead and do the adhd one tho, high probability there. i did suspect that one tho

13:02:32
horridweasel: she could be too

13:02:36
<transcript>: It's possible that we're both autistic. We have a really good relationship. We like each other, love each other, whatever so much. And it might be because neither one of us knew we were autistic. And we found out in adulthood that we're autistic and turned out we're very drawn to each other.

13:02:37
horridweasel: have her do the test haha

13:02:45
thdxr: I thoguht your wife didn't like you

13:02:48
kryotoboi: Today I helped out a code streamer. It felt so good

13:02:49
<transcript>: She could be, I think reading through those questions, if those are the things that make someone I think she is. I think we both are. And I don't think she'd mind me saying that, yeah, I'm gonna have her do the test. She's done a different test. And it said that she was.

13:02:49
<transcript>: i thought

13:02:52
<transcript>: I thought your wife didn't like you. We're not making that a meme. Dax. My wife likes me so much.

13:02:52
<transcript>: i don't

13:02:57
<transcript>: I don't want my I don't want the perception of my wife to be that she doesn't like me.

13:02:57
<transcript>: she

13:03:01
<transcript>: She likes me. You offended me, dax. I'm offended. I'm skin.

13:03:07
<transcript>: Today, I helped out a coach streamer. It felt so good. Oh, did you cry? Oh, who'd? You help.

13:03:07
<transcript>: what would you

13:03:11
thdxr: autism in women usually is a lot more debilitating than in men

13:03:11
<transcript>: What would you help them do? You can help me code because I'm getting ready to right now.

13:03:11
<transcript>: i don't

13:03:16
<transcript>: I don't know what we're doing. Oh, yeah. This right here. So this is a string.

13:03:19
<transcript>: That's a string.

13:03:22
<transcript>: That's a string. That's a string.

13:03:26
<transcript>: Closing. Also a strain. I mean, they're numbers, but they're strings, you know.

13:03:26
<transcript>: so

13:03:29
horridweasel: its also very common for nerodivergent folk to not get along with nerotypicals romantically and in general

13:03:31
<transcript>: So we're gonna take this. I've been doing this. I kind of feel like.

13:03:34
horridweasel: im prime example of this.

13:03:37
<transcript>: Nfl Team Game Stats is what we're calling it.

13:03:41
<transcript>: So in hl team Game stats.

13:03:41
<transcript>: export

13:03:44
stroopwafel26: yeah! back to code

13:03:45
<transcript>: Export interface. Nhl. Look at that.

13:03:45
<transcript>: copil

13:03:48
<transcript>: Copilot knew what I was trying to get at.

13:03:48
basileus__: they're numbers but they're strings - sounds like typescript

13:03:53
<transcript>: Do what I was getting at.

13:03:56
<transcript>: Come on. Where is it? There we go.

13:03:56
<transcript>: so that's

13:04:05
<transcript>: So that's the NFL or NHL team game stats. Now I can do this in hl team games. That's with that one. Oh, no.

13:04:05
<transcript>: what happened

13:04:07
<transcript>: What happened.

13:04:09
<transcript>: I should be a way team.

13:04:16
<transcript>: Waiting.

13:04:17
aer1al___: @HorridWeasel same!

13:04:17
horridweasel: one thing i do is i cant emphatiize with peoples expirences unless ive had them myself so if someone is going thrrough something ill bring up what i went through that is similar as a way to emphaize

13:04:19
<transcript>: It's also very common.

13:04:28
<transcript>: To very common for neurogent folk to not get along with neurotypicals romantically and in general. Interesting.

13:04:32
<transcript>: Autism and women usually is a lot more debilitating than in men.

13:04:36
<transcript>: Interesting. Both of those facts are very interesting to me.

13:04:39
<transcript>: Back to code. Here we go.

13:04:39
<transcript>: they're numbers but

13:04:41
<transcript>: They're numbers, but their strings sounds like typescript.

13:04:45
<transcript>: One thing I do is I can't.

13:04:45
<transcript>: emphath

13:04:47
<transcript>: Emphathize.

13:04:59
<transcript>: Empathize. I think with people's experiences, unless I've had them myself. So someone that's going through. So I'll bring up what I went through that is similar as a way to empathize. Interesting.

13:05:04
<transcript>: That's interesting. I don't know if I do that or not. I think.

13:05:10
horridweasel: @HorridWeasel its hard out there

13:05:15
<transcript>: I'm just so unaware of people and their problems and their needs and whatever, like in person. It's a big struggle because I just don't think about people very much.

13:05:18
<transcript>: I just don't.

13:05:18
<transcript>: i don't

13:05:28
<transcript>: I don't think about people very much. I don't know what that means. Might mean. I'm autistic. I guess I'm nervous. Neurodyn divergent. That's the word.

13:05:34
<transcript>: This is all actually making a ton of sense. I feel like today if I accomplished nothing.

13:05:40
<transcript>: I learned that I may be autistic and that's maybe why my brain works this way.

13:05:44
basileus__: I also have to force myself to focus on and think about people, and very frequently fail to do so

13:05:44
<transcript>: Good to know good to know.

13:05:49
<transcript>: Okay. Nhl historical box score is done.

13:05:49
<transcript>: we are ready

13:05:53
<transcript>: We are ready to go back to NHL Box Score component.

13:05:55
<transcript>: Delete that.

13:05:55
<transcript>: lsp

13:05:56
<transcript>: Lsp restart.

13:05:58
kryotoboi: A true man declares variables and functions alphabetically,  writes css alphabetically and adds attributes alphabetically to html.

13:06:01
<transcript>: Okay.

13:06:01
kryotoboi: LUL

13:06:07
<transcript>: Also I have to force myself to focus on and think about people and very frequently failed to do so. Me too.

13:06:07
<transcript>: that's exactly the right

13:06:09
<transcript>: That's exactly the right wording.

13:06:12
<transcript>: I want to do better.

13:06:13
horridweasel: in these 25 mins ive been a follower i got adam and chat diagnosed with autism

13:06:17
<transcript>: I just don't.

13:06:21
horridweasel: yay nerodivergent squad!!

13:06:23
<transcript>: I thought there was a box score thing for this.

13:06:25
<transcript>: Team detail.

13:06:29
<transcript>: Is there no sumary, not the grid.

13:06:32
<transcript>: Interesting.

13:06:37
basileus__: I love being part of a squad

13:06:39
<transcript>: A true man declares variables and functions Alphabetically rights, css, Alphabetically, and Ads attributes alphabetically to HTML.

13:06:42
<transcript>: I don't do any of those things. I don't think.

13:06:45
<transcript>: We're part of a squad. Everybody.

13:06:49
<transcript>: It's okay if you're not neurodivers, you can also be part of our squad.

13:06:55
<transcript>: But yeah, we'll have a little we'll make a channel. Maybe in the Watch, dev, discord.

13:06:55
magerdev: Good Morning Adam!

13:06:56
<transcript>: Next.

13:07:00
aer1al___: inclusive squad !

13:07:01
inch_high_leprechaun: There's probably a reason we work with computers more than people.

13:07:02
horridweasel: !discord

13:07:03
fossabot: Adam is a member of the watch.dev Discord server and he'd love to see you there: https://discord.gg/watchdotdev

13:07:09
<transcript>: Okay. That I know you're in charge of channels. Good morning, Major dev. I thought this was gonna have Inclusive Squad. There you go. Welcome to Chat Inch High leprechaun. There's probably a reason we work with computers more than people.

13:07:12
<transcript>: Interesting.

13:07:13
inch_high_leprechaun: Hi!

13:07:17
<transcript>: Is there a parallel there.

13:07:17
<transcript>: i wonder if there's

13:07:19
<transcript>: I wonder if there's an studied on that or something.

13:07:22
<transcript>: Okay. I thought there was gonna be.

13:07:22
<transcript>: there's gonna be

13:07:24
thdxr: adam was a decorated quarterback he can't be autistic

13:07:25
<transcript>: There's gonna be a scoring summary on this for some reason.

13:07:25
<transcript>: let's see

13:07:27
stroopwafel26: i'm gonna need to close this stream to get some work done, but i'm gonna listen to your podcast now @adamdotdev @thdxr

13:07:27
horridweasel: yep i find that most devs are nerodivergent

13:07:28
kryotoboi: But on computers I end up seeing people

13:07:29
<transcript>: Let's see there. Is it's called scoring summary. What the.

13:07:29
<transcript>: what

13:07:30
<transcript>: What.

13:07:34
<transcript>: Why is that? What? What.

13:07:34
<transcript>: mba

13:07:36
<transcript>: Mba Historical Box or something's wrong.

13:07:36
<transcript>: in hl

13:07:39
<transcript>: In Hlbox world let's go to this one.

13:07:39
thdxr: woo

13:07:46
<transcript>: I'm gonna need to close the stream to get some work done. I'm gonna listen to your podcast now. Yes, stroop, please do.

13:07:46
horridweasel: i mean prime examples .... elon musk , mark auccerberg , steve wasniak

13:07:49
<transcript>: Adam was the decorated quarterback. You can't be autistic.

13:07:49
<transcript>: what's that supposed

13:07:49
horridweasel: more and more

13:07:51
<transcript>: What's that supposed to mean.

13:07:51
<transcript>: or can

13:07:54
magerdev: which editor are you using that shows the error on the line that the error is on?

13:07:54
<transcript>: Or can you not be neurodivergent and athletic.

13:07:54
<transcript>: i find

13:07:54
basileus__: Maybe the cross-section of people who code, and people who watch other people code (or stream coding), has a really high chance of attracting certain individuals

13:07:56
kryotoboi: Either I am playing games or watching content everything with humans NotLikeThis

13:07:59
<transcript>: I find that most divs are neurodivergent.

13:08:10
<transcript>: Interesting. On computers. I end up seeing people. I mean, prime examples. Elon Musk, Mark zuckerberg, Steve Wildniak. Were they all autistic.

13:08:10
<transcript>: more and more

13:08:20
<transcript>: More and more which editor are you using that shows the air on the line that the air is on. This is Neoveim so that's NBA Visual it should be NHL visual.

13:08:26
<transcript>: Now we should have a scoring summary. Lsp restart.

13:08:36
<transcript>: Maybe the cross section of people who code and people who watch other people code or stream coding has a really high chance of attracting certain individuals. I bet it does.

13:08:41
<transcript>: Either I am playing games or watching content everything with humans.

13:08:46
<transcript>: Period is what these are called. We're going to call them that.

13:08:46
<transcript>: rena

13:08:46
magerdev: Ahhh, I configured vim into my intelliJ set up, but I've been thinking about trying NeoVim once my 1 year subscription runs out

13:08:50
<transcript>: Rename to period.

13:08:54
<transcript>: Okay.

13:09:01
basileus__: Neovim btw

13:09:10
<transcript>: I configured them into my intelligence setup, but I've been thinking about trying new of them once my oneyear subscription runs out, I really enjoyed it major. It's definitely like it's an experience. You've got to kind of be up for tinkering. You gotta enjoy Tiny tinkering with your editor. If you do.

13:09:12
<transcript>: Then I think you'll love Neil. Them.

13:09:12
<transcript>: period

13:09:17
<transcript>: Periods Map Three name this two just period.

13:09:27
<transcript>: Next, I'm offended by your comment about me being a quarterback and neurodiver. I'm just kidding. I'm not actually offended. I don't even know what it would be to be offended. I don't know what that feeling feels like.

13:09:27
<transcript>: just literally

13:09:30
<transcript>: Just literally never been offended.

13:09:30
<transcript>: hatch telling

13:09:38
<transcript>: Hatch telling. I feel like that tells me something about myself. I can't believe I'm 36, and I'm just realizing that. But like I don't think I've ever been offended in my life.

13:09:45
thdxr: I'm gonna keep try

13:09:46
<transcript>: I don't think there's a person that could offend me because I don't think I put enough weight in people in their opinions to be offended by a person. Does that make sense.

13:09:52
basileus__: LUL

13:09:52
thdxr: adam ur ugly

13:09:53
neochromer: "You can't offend me peasant"

13:09:54
horridweasel: yep perfect sense

13:09:55
<transcript>: You're gonna keep trying. Keep trying, dax. You would be the one.

13:09:55
<transcript>: and you're

13:10:02
<transcript>: And you're ugly. You would be the one decks if you can if it's possible. If in me it'll be you. I mean, you hold a lot of weight for me.

13:10:06
<transcript>: I mean my wife can't offend me because like.

13:10:06
<transcript>: it's a different

13:10:09
<transcript>: It's a different relationship. I feel like.

13:10:11
thdxr: you hold a lot of weight on yourself

13:10:16
<transcript>: It's important for us to challenge each other. You know, me and my wife. I don't think it. I don't think she could offend me. But.

13:10:16
<transcript>: i hold a lot

13:10:18
<transcript>: I hold a lot of weight on yourself.

13:10:25
<transcript>: Am I just selfcentered? Is that what it is? I'm not actually any of these things. I'm just selfcentered.

13:10:25
<transcript>: it could be

13:10:28
<transcript>: It could be maybe I'm just selfish.

13:10:30
horridweasel: im jewish and someone told me that hit** should have killed all of us and that i belong in an oven and i felt nothing

13:10:31
thdxr: I was trying to call you a fatty

13:10:32
thdxr: lol

13:10:33
<transcript>: Okay, let's see. Are there any Other Quarter references.

13:10:33
<transcript>: no

13:10:34
horridweasel: lmao i just laughed

13:10:34
kryotoboi: You mean there has not been PR review that has offended you when you were a wee young lad ?

13:10:35
<transcript>: No.

13:10:36
<transcript>: Oh, is it not.

13:10:36
<transcript>: did i do nh

13:10:38
<transcript>: Did I do NHL.

13:10:38
<transcript>: team

13:10:42
<transcript>: Team. There's the periods, there's the teams.

13:10:44
<transcript>: Here's the summary.

13:10:44
<transcript>: looks

13:10:51
<transcript>: Looks right for the second period. Third period. Team stats. Oh, that's not right. Nope.

13:10:54
<transcript>: Not that.

13:10:54
basileus__: I would laugh at that too, sounds ridiculous

13:10:58
<transcript>: We gotta do the team sets. Now, remember when I did this yesterday.

13:11:01
<transcript>: And then I did it twice because my editor ate all the text.

13:11:05
<transcript>: Oh, playersats, is this good? This looks good.

13:11:13
<transcript>: I was trying to call you a fatty. Wait, wait. What? You hold a lot of weight on it. Oh.

13:11:17
horridweasel: @Basileus__ i got told a lot of these kinds of things always kinda shrugged it

13:11:18
<transcript>: I see what you did. Still not offended, though I'm sorry. I'm Jewish. And someone told me that.

13:11:23
<transcript>: Hit star oh should have killed oh, my goodness.

13:11:25
<transcript>: And you felt nothing.

13:11:25
<transcript>: see

13:11:31
<transcript>: See? Okay. I feel like there's something there. There's something about.

13:11:34
<transcript>: Our brains that cannot be offended.

13:11:34
<transcript>: i'm

13:11:40
<transcript>: I'm believe anything about myself. I believe that I believe it's impossible to have it in me.

13:11:42
ttbishop: it's called confidence

13:11:52
<transcript>: And I think that's why, like, sometimes when someone is offended by something I say, it's so hard for me to, like, grasp, what do you mean? Like what? What does it mean to be offended? It's called confidence. Is that all it is.

13:12:03
<transcript>: There's not been PR review that is offended you when you were we young lads. No, I don't think so. Maybe that's why I don't care about my code. Because I'm not offendable. I can't be offended.

13:12:03
<transcript>: dax

13:12:07
<transcript>: Dax, are you? Can you be offended? I feel like dax. You couldn't be offended, could you.

13:12:07
<transcript>: i feel like i

13:12:09
thdxr: I get offended when people use EC2

13:12:10
<transcript>: I feel like I couldn't offend you either.

13:12:16
<transcript>: I get a fend in with people use easy.

13:12:18
basileus__: Uh oh

13:12:18
kryotoboi: The Non-offendables

13:12:21
<transcript>: Is that what that is? Because I feel that whatever that feels, I feel that feeling.

13:12:24
<transcript>: But I didn't know that was being offended.

13:12:27
horridweasel: i get offended when people refuse to try svelte and sveltekit ;-;

13:12:29
<transcript>: Okay, let's do this.

13:12:29
<transcript>: team

13:12:30
ttbishop: that's how I see it, I reason about things and I'm aware of my own self

13:12:30
<transcript>: Team stats.

13:12:33
<transcript>: Here.

13:12:33
<transcript>: okay

13:12:37
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah. This does not have first downs. What's the first one.

13:12:40
terawatthour: @thdxr thats the way to go

13:12:43
basileus__: *slowly hides his 600 EC2 instances in the closet*

13:12:43
<transcript>: Goals, shots, penalty minutes. Let's see if I can remember more than one at a time.

13:12:43
<transcript>: goals

13:12:45
<transcript>: Goals.

13:12:47
<transcript>: It's gonna be gold.

13:12:49
thdxr: I definitely could get more offended when I was younger, as I got older with less to prove I have a hard time caring about what most people say

13:12:55
<transcript>: Shots.

13:13:00
dalt_kb: yay nhl time

13:13:01
<transcript>: Cool.

13:13:03
<transcript>: Shots.

13:13:08
<transcript>: Penalties. I think I could type right penalties.

13:13:11
thdxr: me being offended was -> me needing to prove something -> someone denying that

13:13:12
<transcript>: Penalties.

13:13:14
<transcript>: Cool.

13:13:14
<transcript>: penalty

13:13:15
<transcript>: Penalty.

13:13:18
glamshatterskull: some people confuse being less offended with being more offensive

13:13:19
<transcript>: Look at that. I did three of them.

13:13:23
<transcript>: Gold Shops Penalty Minutes Close minutes.

13:13:23
<transcript>: penal

13:13:25
<transcript>: Penalty minutes.

13:13:28
<transcript>: Oh, those shouldn't be indented, either.

13:13:32
<transcript>: Penalty.

13:13:32
<transcript>: minutes

13:13:33
<transcript>: Minutes.

13:13:41
<transcript>: Penalty minutes.

13:13:43
thdxr: so when I was younger if someone was like "remote work is dumb" I woulda been mad because I wasn't sure if I would be able to have a career doing that, but now I'm secure in that so idc

13:13:44
<transcript>: Multi minute.

13:13:48
<transcript>: Gotha.

13:14:00
terawatthour: this stream is probably the first thing about NHL that reached more than 10 viewers concurrently

13:14:02
<transcript>: Definitely could get more offended when I was younger. As I got older, with less to prove, I had a hard time caring about what most people say. Maybe that's what it is. Maybe I was able to be offended when I was younger. I don't remember. I don't remember much about my childhood. Is that a thing.

13:14:08
<transcript>: That's I get to send in with people refuse to try severelt and selfguish.

13:14:08
<transcript>: that

13:14:11
glamshatterskull: do y'all have any player stats like "favorite color"? non sports related arbitrary stuff

13:14:16
<transcript>: That's how I see it. I reason about things, and I'm aware of my own self. I'm not very selfaware. That's another thing about me that might just be a quirk of mine.

13:14:19
<transcript>: Slowly hides a 600 EC, two instances in the closet.

13:14:19
<transcript>: i

13:14:25
<transcript>: I don't see me being offended was meaning to prove something. Someone denying that. Oh, interesting.

13:14:25
<transcript>: glen is

13:14:30
<transcript>: Glen is here. Some people confused being less attended with being more offensive.

13:14:34
<transcript>: So less offended.

13:14:34
<transcript>: more offensive

13:14:36
<transcript>: More offensive.

13:14:40
<transcript>: So if you're offended less by things.

13:14:44
<transcript>: Some people think that you're more offensive. Is that what you're saying? Glam.

13:14:44
<transcript>: so when i was young

13:14:51
glamshatterskull: like they say "nothing offends me" but then just say horrible shit

13:14:55
<transcript>: So when I was younger, if someone was like, remote work is dumb, I would be. I would have been mad because I wasn't sure if I would be able to have a career doing that. Now I'm secure in that. So I don't care. That makes sense. Maybe I was the same. I just don't remember.

13:14:55
<transcript>: or i

13:15:00
<transcript>: Or I'm not self aware enough. This stream is probably the first thing about NHL that reached more than ten viewers concurrently.

13:15:01
glamshatterskull: as if the two are the same

13:15:04
<transcript>: It's kind of about NHL. It's kind of about.

13:15:04
<transcript>: psychology

13:15:05
<transcript>: Psychology.

13:15:07
<transcript>: Brain chemistry.

13:15:22
<transcript>: And lara Bars. That's basically what the stream is. Do you all have any players that's, like, favorite color, non sports related, arbitrary stuff. We talked about doing, like a poll, like actually asking much of players questions, like that just for fun. Like for social media. I don't think we ever did it, though.

13:15:22
<transcript>: they

13:15:26
<transcript>: They say nothing offends me, but then just say horrible shit. Oh, interesting.

13:15:32
<transcript>: Oh, I see. Well, I don't think I say offensive things. I don't think.

13:15:37
<transcript>: Nothing offends me so I'm gonna say terrible thanks. Yeah, I see.

13:15:38
terawatthour: yeah you're right NHL has 5 fans combined across the whole world so 10 is impossible

13:15:40
<transcript>: Okay.

13:15:43
<transcript>: None of these were indented.

13:15:43
<transcript>: none of them

13:15:49
glamshatterskull: yes that idea... entitlement

13:15:51
<transcript>: None of them. So after penalty minutes, what do we have? What do we have after penalty meant? Power play goals. Power play opportunities.

13:15:51
<transcript>: so let's see

13:15:53
<transcript>: So let's see.

13:15:58
<transcript>: Powerplay, Goals, Power Play, Goals, Hockey, sponge.

13:16:10
<transcript>: Like no other sport. Do they let you play with an uneven number of players, right? That's pretty fun in hockey. They're like, okay, you screwed up. You were a dirk. You gotta sit in that box and watch your team.

13:16:10
<transcript>: now it's gonna be

13:16:13
<transcript>: Now it's gonna be five on four or whatever. That's pretty fun.

13:16:13
<transcript>: like

13:16:17
<transcript>: Like as an idea. That's pretty fun. I wish other sports would do that.

13:16:19
neochromer: @adamdotdev soccer has that too

13:16:20
<transcript>: Like if the NFL did that.

13:16:20
<transcript>: i

13:16:22
neochromer: if you get Red card

13:16:25
neochromer: you our without 1 player

13:16:26
<transcript>: I mean, it would be so unfair. Like if you literally got to go like, eleven on ten.

13:16:26
<transcript>: there

13:16:28
<transcript>: There's just no way.

13:16:28
<transcript>: the tin

13:16:29
neochromer: you are*

13:16:33
<transcript>: The tin would do anything right. It would just be like a blood bass.

13:16:36
<transcript>: Like the NFL is just so physically.

13:16:36
<transcript>: whatever

13:16:37
<transcript>: Whatever.

13:16:37
<transcript>: power play

13:16:39
<transcript>: Power Play opportunities.

13:16:39
<transcript>: i don't think

13:16:42
<transcript>: I don't think it could work in the NFL.

13:16:43
dnbull: I mostly agree. I'm at the age in my life (I'm young in my 30s) I dont find a lot of things offensive anymore. I just sit back and watch how the world is so strange.

13:16:47
neochromer: it happens in England that 2 people leave the game and they still win without 2 people

13:16:52
<transcript>: Let's see. What do we have left? Face off. Wins. Face off. Wins. Hits. Giveaways. Takeaways. Okay.

13:16:56
<transcript>: Say softlins.

13:17:01
<transcript>: Face off wins.

13:17:04
<transcript>: Off end.

13:17:09
trivenge: a lot going on today, busy one. hope the stream and work is going well

13:17:10
<transcript>: Giveaways takeaways all right.

13:17:15
<transcript>: How much I can get done if I actually try.

13:17:15
<transcript>: oh no

13:17:17
<transcript>: Oh no.

13:17:20
<transcript>: Hits.

13:17:24
<transcript>: Alike physically hit a player or no.

13:17:24
<transcript>: giveaways

13:17:27
<transcript>: Giveaways oh man.

13:17:27
<transcript>: give

13:17:28
<transcript>: Give away.

13:17:31
<transcript>: Giveaway.

13:17:50
<transcript>: Delete all these.

13:17:53
<transcript>: Wow, there's a lot of football sets.

13:17:58
<transcript>: Oh really.

13:18:04
glamshatterskull: moar stats

13:18:05
<transcript>: You're right Inch Yellow has five fans combined across the whole world so ten is impossible.

13:18:22
<transcript>: Entitlement. That makes sense. That makes sense. Glim. I'm. On your same page. If you get red cards, you are without one player. Interesting. I mostly agree. I'm at the age of my life, I mean young in my thirties. I don't find a lot of things offensive anymore. I just sit back and watch how the world is so strange.

13:18:22
<transcript>: that feel

13:18:23
trivenge: by rewriting statemuse with astro and sst, what do you gain most in doing that, and is there any negatives associated with rewriting it?

13:18:24
<transcript>: That feels like a good description of what I do.

13:18:27
<transcript>: I would say.

13:18:28
neochromer: English Premier League

13:18:35
<transcript>: I don't see it happens in England that two people leave the game and they still win without two people.

13:18:42
<transcript>: That's awesome. A lot going on today. Busy one hope to stream and work is going well hey Trio, if it's going well, thanks so well.

13:18:42
statsndata: Does Statmuse still feel like a monolith of a web app to you? Or since you've seen it from the beginning do you only see statmuse from the "edge" perspective, meaning you only tunnel vision your latest feature/challenge (or Astro conversion lol)

13:18:54
<transcript>: Glam more stats by rewriting stat muse with astronauts to see what the do you gain most in doing that? And is there any negatives associated with rewriting it? So the negative is.

13:18:57
<transcript>: When is the time investment.

13:19:03
<transcript>: The positives are we should be able to move faster in the future as we add new stuff.

13:19:03
<transcript>: because

13:19:11
trivenge: gotcha

13:19:13
<transcript>: Because it's a much more familiar stack. It's just a bunch of javascript, whereas the stack today is a mixed mash of elixir and react and.

13:19:13
<transcript>: it's just

13:19:16
horridweasel: if youre awaree with svelte ... is astro nicer? what i like about svelte is how simple it is

13:19:21
trivenge: so simplifying things, makes sense

13:19:24
terawatthour: elixir? u got real-time?

13:19:24
basileus__: What do you use the elixir for?

13:19:26
horridweasel: also does tailwind work with it? :o

13:19:28
<transcript>: It's just a little harder to reason about. So we haven't done much with the site. We haven't changed fundamentally what statmes.com is for, like, three, four, five years. So we're getting ready to do a whole lot of new development. And we want to kind of, like, be on good fitting, if that makes sense.

13:19:34
<transcript>: Thank you so much for follow.

13:19:34
<transcript>: int wick

13:19:36
<transcript>: Int. Wickler.

13:19:47
trivenge: i was told that i should focus on astro, svelte, and sst in the future as well

13:19:53
<transcript>: English Premier League epl? Yeah, we're gonna add support for epl. The Samuel still feel like a monolith of a web app to you or since you've seen it from the beginning, do you only see Statmes from the edge perspective? Meaning the only tunnel vision your latest feature, challenge.

13:19:56
trivenge: when i get capable in that area at least SeemsGood

13:19:58
<transcript>: So I mean model, is it's I don't really know if I understand.

13:19:58
<transcript>: exactly

13:20:00
<transcript>: Exactly what makes some.

13:20:02
neochromer: Entwickler is Developer on German Fun Fact

13:20:04
<transcript>: The Web app is one giant thing. Okay.

13:20:04
<transcript>: there's also

13:20:09
<transcript>: There's also a cms in there that like our creatives use to create content on the home page.

13:20:09
<transcript>: and

13:20:19
<transcript>: And for the iOS app. So the web app is sort of like, I guess on my monolith, it's a big app. But then we have another monolith that's our inner piece stack. It's totally different technologies.

13:20:19
<transcript>: it has very different

13:20:29
<transcript>: It has very different goals. It's an api that our front end consumes. And then we have all these other projects. But I guess or mollus. I don't know. We have a bunch of monoliths. Is that microservices.

13:20:49
<transcript>: If you're aware with Felt is astro nicer? What I like about self is how simple it is. So astro is just for generating like the stuff I'm doing with astro is just a server side. I'm not even using Islands of client side interactivity. I haven't even gotten to interactivity yet. The only interactive bits of the Statmese website.

13:20:49
<transcript>: are like

13:20:51
<transcript>: Are like tables.

13:20:51
<transcript>: so like

13:20:54
<transcript>: So like sorting. I'll show you.

13:20:54
<transcript>: like sorting table

13:21:02
<transcript>: Like sorting tables. That's like it. Everything else is just like it should just render the big dumb page, right? So in that sense.

13:21:02
<transcript>: astro is

13:21:06
<transcript>: Astro is a great fit and I love it smelt.

13:21:06
<transcript>: is like

13:21:15
<transcript>: Is like you want to have simple client side interactivity, like minimalist client side stuff. I just don't have any clients that stuff to deal with. So it's kind of like apples to oranges.

13:21:15
<transcript>: but

13:21:25
<transcript>: But astro has been fantastic. I mean, it's just what you'd expect. Like you've got fences at the top of your file. You can write whatever you want, typescript, javascript and ultimately.

13:21:32
trivenge: ah ok ty for the insight

13:21:32
<transcript>: Get the data, do whatever you need to do to render the page and then render the page in html. It's it's that simple. I mean, it's pretty.

13:21:35
<transcript>: Pretty simple.

13:21:38
statsndata: Ty

13:21:40
<transcript>: So some fine things make sense? Yeah, yeah. Elixir, you got real time.

13:21:46
<transcript>: So we wrote the app originally. Whatever. Seven, eight years ago in elixir, it's Phoenix.

13:21:46
<transcript>: we don't

13:21:49
<transcript>: We don't have any realtime stuff.

13:21:49
<transcript>: the reason it

13:21:51
<transcript>: The reason it was elixir was.

13:21:51
<transcript>: we had an

13:22:06
<transcript>: We had an engineer that was really into elixir, and they want to use a lecture. I'm like, sure. That's mostly how decisions at our startup have gone, who works here? And what are they really into? Okay. Build it with that as long as you're into it. And now I guess we're rewriting it. So there you go.

13:22:06
<transcript>: this

13:22:08
<transcript>: This tailwind. Work with it. Yes.

13:22:08
<transcript>: i was

13:22:19
<transcript>: I was told that I should focus on astros felt in ssd in the future as well. Interesting when I get capable in that area so ssd is fantastic if you're gonna build apps on AWS.

13:22:19
<transcript>: ssd is

13:22:20
<transcript>: Ssd is the way to go.

13:22:20
<transcript>: astro

13:22:37
<transcript>: Astro I love for like server side generating. It's definitely a use case thing. Like if you if you're building a spa even astro in the docs will tell you don't use astro. It's not good for building like a big client side application where it's all client sided interactivity. Don't do that. But if you're building something that's more like.

13:22:37
<transcript>: lots of page

13:22:42
<transcript>: Lots of pages, little actually interactivity. I think astro is a great fit.

13:22:44
<transcript>: Okay.

13:22:48
<transcript>: Developer on German fun fact.

13:22:48
<transcript>: interesting that means

13:22:53
<transcript>: Interesting. That means developer in German. Okay. Okay.

13:22:53
<transcript>: i just learned something

13:23:00
<transcript>: I just learned something new. I love learning stuff on on stream. You guys teach me so much. Okay, I think we finished talking.

13:23:00
<transcript>: let's just

13:23:05
thdxr: entwickler sounds so much cooler

13:23:07
<transcript>: Let's just do it once over here, that all looks well, I guess we can do the thing where we like, scroll, the top, scroll, the top.

13:23:12
<transcript>: Two nothing changing. I mean other than the text here.

13:23:12
<transcript>: and stuff at

13:23:18
mecoupz: my company calls everyone "IT Consultant" instead of Entwickler

13:23:18
<transcript>: And stuff at the top. Don't ignore the top, but like the page itself looks good. Let's scroll the bottom. Just go to the bottom.

13:23:22
<transcript>: Oh, it's gonna change because I'm not doing that.

13:23:25
<transcript>: Let's just do this.

13:23:28
<transcript>: Pin it to the top of that thing.

13:23:28
<transcript>: and

13:23:31
trivenge: are you about to rename sst to entwickler? @thdxr

13:23:31
<transcript>: And then send this one to the top of this thing.

13:23:32
trivenge: LUL

13:23:35
<transcript>: Remember when we spent three days the Tab component. That was fun.

13:23:35
<transcript>: all the

13:23:39
<transcript>: All the values look right. I didn't fat finger something. Nope. Looks good.

13:23:43
<transcript>: Aunt Lipler does sound so much cooler.

13:23:43
<transcript>: is there like

13:23:45
<transcript>: Is there like a ent.

13:23:50
<transcript>: I'd love to add Adam ent to my list.

13:23:50
<transcript>: my

13:23:54
<transcript>: My company calls everyone it consultant instead of intwickler. Interesting.

13:23:57
kryotoboi: Did anyone use Gatsby ?

13:24:02
<transcript>: Okay. We finished it. We did it. All of the all of the team.

13:24:06
terawatthour: @Kryotoboi in 1995 we used gatsby

13:24:06
<transcript>: Profile or game? Recap pages.

13:24:06
<transcript>: are done

13:24:08
<transcript>: Are done.

13:24:08
<transcript>: they're all done

13:24:11
<transcript>: They're all done. You can go to Team pages.

13:24:11
<transcript>: you can go

13:24:13
<transcript>: You can go to player pages.

13:24:13
<transcript>: you can

13:24:21
<transcript>: You can go to game pages. This is all the local site. I've done it. I've completed all of this.

13:24:21
<transcript>: go to that game

13:24:25
<transcript>: Go to that game page. It's good. I think the only thing left.

13:24:26
dnbull: awesome!

13:24:34
<transcript>: I think the only thing left is all of the things I've forgotten about. So musings is a thing.

13:24:41
<transcript>: If you're on this status calm today and you go here. This is called amusing.

13:24:41
<transcript>: the statin

13:24:44
<transcript>: The statinus. Like a little tidbit.

13:24:44
<transcript>: so yes

13:24:58
<transcript>: So yesterday at 959, we made this one, randall. And the loss had these stats 1st 50 point game by Nick since mellow, that's carmello Anthony. For those not versed in sports language.

13:24:58
<transcript>: so this

13:25:02
dnbull: damn... 57pts and loss? whew

13:25:05
<transcript>: So this is called amusing. I got to do this because we got a ton of these links out there on the internet, and we got to be able to render those correctly.

13:25:05
<transcript>: to do that

13:25:06
<transcript>: To do that.

13:25:06
<transcript>: i'm gonna have to connect

13:25:08
<transcript>: I'm gonna have to connect to our postgres database.

13:25:12
<transcript>: So I got to get like a postgres library. But first.

13:25:14
dnbull: come on julius randle

13:25:16
<transcript>: 1st, 57 points on a loss that does suck. Wow.

13:25:23
<transcript>: But first I got a P really bad. Actually, I'll be back. I'm gonna go pee.

13:25:26
trivenge: not unheard of these days, it does happen in the nba @dnbull

13:25:34
dnbull: @triveNge I'm aware lol

13:25:37
trivenge: oh ok lol

13:25:43
dnbull: it happens too often in my opinion

13:25:48
dnbull: dropping 40s and 50s and losing

13:25:50
trivenge: yeah it does

13:26:02
dnbull: but to almost reach 60 thats nuts

13:26:04
trivenge: part of me wonders if its more stat padding going on or something else

13:26:10
statsndata: I can tell y'all aren't Rockets fans

13:26:12
statsndata: Lucky

13:26:19
dnbull: like the harden days? LUL

13:26:21
andreaslorozco: @statsndata lol

13:26:27
statsndata: But 40s and a loss is all too common

13:26:41
statsndata: @dnbull only towards the end

13:26:44
dnbull: or..... westbrook with the thunders dropping triple doubles and losing most of them? LUL

13:26:45
trivenge: was listening to a jj redick podcast where he was talkin with kevin durant and another with someone else i cant think of atm, and in both cases, they said stat padding is rampant NotLikeThis

13:26:53
statsndata: After Chris Paul the losses hurt harder

13:27:15
trivenge: actually, statistically, during his reign with the thunders, i think the thunders won more when he was dropping a triple double than not @dnbull  if i recall

13:27:17
trivenge: could be wrong

13:27:38
dnbull: i think the nba "ring" culture is dead so I think the mentallity of the players have shifted so its all about stats... just assumptions here.

13:27:53
dnbull: @triveNge probably true. the media made sure we knew when he lost from a trip dub

13:28:03
trivenge: i think thats a safe assumption. i think some people still want the ring, but the goal is longevity in stats to secure a legacy and status

13:28:05
trivenge: which would make sense

13:28:08
trivenge: they want to be remembered

13:28:31
dnbull: And some play hard for a "season" since their contract is about to be up to get paid then go back in their bubble

13:28:31
statsndata: Ring culture mattered more when winning the championship made you the equivalent of winning a "few million".

13:28:37
dnbull: can't blame them when NBA throwing money like that

13:28:52
horridweasel: i unfourtantly need to go got a docs apointment

13:28:54
statsndata: I think ring culture died when making a brand out of yourself could make you much more money off the court.

13:28:56
trivenge: that money throwing wont go away either

13:28:58
horridweasel: see yall next time it was fun

13:29:06
statsndata: Why win a ring when you could become a billionaire investor

13:29:19
dnbull: yeah I think once that money, sponsors set it the idea of a ring is not a priority to most players

13:29:35
trivenge: i mean if you have about 100m in possible liquidity, i would invest and look to secure a larger net worth myself lol

13:29:45
trivenge: some players are smart, some just waste it and party

13:30:14
trivenge: reminds me of the time when i was involved with techstars and high tech rochester lol

13:30:17
dnbull: I think about damian llilard. in theory he should have a ring but hes trying so hard to be loyal to trailblazers. Hes getting mad money but damn he would be nice pairing with another star.

13:30:37
daglee: TIL: MALLOC_PERTURB_ is awesome. Saved my ass big time today.

13:30:50
trivenge: damian lillard is a fantastic player

13:31:21
dnbull: but also boooo to the trailblazers for not making effort to bring him someone smh

13:31:25
<transcript>: Alright.

13:31:29
<transcript>: Hey, we accomplished something I meant to accomplish last week, but.

13:31:29
<transcript>: it's tuesday

13:31:30
daglee: It makes malloc and free set a value to pointers after use. So you don't get dangling pointers etc in your tests.

13:31:32
<transcript>: It's Tuesday. It's still kind of early.

13:31:32
<transcript>: name change

<transcript>: Okay. Should I reach out? How much did I miss.

13:31:51
trivenge: i was never good at basketball when i was younger. i was always trying to shoot threes, but i didnt get into the basketball team in high school because im 5 foot 9 lol. they wanted taller folks at the time lol. i played soccer and wrestling instead

13:31:52
statsndata: I know he doesn't follow the NBA as much but he has his loyalties deep down

13:31:54
<transcript>: No, I missed a lot.

13:31:54
<transcript>: you guys

13:31:57
<transcript>: You guys talk about basketball.

13:32:04
<transcript>: Looks like mostly basketball. I'm just gonna kind of skip over all of it. It paints me. It pains me now. Not read it.

13:32:04
<transcript>: j

13:32:07
<transcript>: J. Slish. Thank you for that. Follow.

13:32:13
trivenge: yeah you dont need to follow the convo lol

13:32:18
<transcript>: I was never gonna basketball when I was younger. Knows the following me much has his loyalty's deep down so that's the things that's a data I don't have an NBA team because.

13:32:18
<transcript>: i live in the ocean

13:32:29
<transcript>: I live in the ocean. We live in like, a like, literally where I live in springfield, Missouri. You could, like, draw a radius. It's a pretty big area before you hit an mba team. The closest to a team, I think, is the Memphis Grizzlies.

13:32:29
<transcript>: i think

13:32:31
<transcript>: I think.

13:32:34
<transcript>: And then I guess like.

13:32:34
<transcript>: going

13:32:38
trivenge: ozarks is that big?

13:32:54
<transcript>: Going south into Texas, like, it's just it's kind of a big hole in the NBA map that I live in. So I just it's I don't have a team. I think I like the NBA back when it was like Michael Jordan as a kid and then lebron James coming along. I'd liked it during his peak of his powers and like Curry, too. But like I've kind of fallen off or like.

13:32:54
<transcript>: at least lebron

13:32:56
<transcript>: At least lebron, I guess getting older.

13:32:56
<transcript>: and my interest is just

13:33:01
<transcript>: And my interest is just waned I think I've only ever really been into players.

13:33:01
<transcript>: ozarks is that

13:33:02
dnbull: falling off? :O

13:33:03
<transcript>: Ozarks. Is that big? It's like.

13:33:03
<transcript>: the ozark

13:33:05
statsndata: I'm going to tell mom you're a bulls fan

13:33:05
trivenge: my interest is weighing as well

13:33:09
<transcript>: The ozarks is a mountain range in Southern Floor or Southern Florida, Southern Missouri.

13:33:09
<transcript>: and northern

13:33:09
kedemel: I'm in Cleveland. We are ridiculously loyal to Cleveland teams.

13:33:10
<transcript>: And Northern Arkansas.

13:33:19
<transcript>: Falling off. Yeah. I guess maybe he's not. I don't follow the NBA. What do I know? Is he falling off? He should be. He's like 40 now, isn't he? How old is LeBron.

13:33:21
trivenge: i think thats the same thing for me, more interested in players and their mindsets than the game much now

13:33:25
<transcript>: So I have a football team. And it's cheese.

13:33:25
<transcript>: because

13:33:26
<transcript>: Because.

13:33:26
<transcript>: my dad grow

13:33:28
okufa_f: lebron is not falling off no, he is still going strong

13:33:29
neochromer: 38

13:33:30
<transcript>: My dad growing up is a huge sand. I mean, they're the closest team to us, but.

13:33:30
<transcript>: she

13:33:33
neochromer: so not that old

13:33:44
statsndata: Hahaha 38 is basketball 45

13:33:44
dnbull: I think it's going to be weird once Lebron, KD, Curry is gone from the NBA. Many talented players but something feels different

13:33:51
<transcript>: She sang. And they were always so bad. So it's so fun for me as an adult now to see the teacher really good. And like, the most exciting team, they always had no quarterback. They were always just terrible and boring. Like the quarterbacks were always awful. And now we have Pat mahones, and he's just like this revelation in football. So that's been really fun. My dad gets to watch.

13:33:51
<transcript>: the chief

13:33:52
statsndata: Lebron is just generational

13:33:55
neochromer: Steve Nash played also very old age?

13:33:58
trivenge: lebron is probably the longevity goat imo, longest peaking player  that will probably never be touched for a long time

13:33:59
<transcript>: The chief win the Super Bowl. That's new. I'd never made the playoffs growing up like they were just always so bad. I guess they made a playoffsides. They're just always bad, though.

13:33:59
<transcript>: let's

13:34:02
daglee: You say football and then talk about eggball!

13:34:05
<transcript>: Let's see. I'm in Cleveland. We are ridiculously loyal to Cleveland teams. So.

13:34:07
statsndata: You're not finding other 33+ year olds who aren't legends

13:34:08
dnbull: lebron spends 5 million dollars on his body alone. he's still going strong

13:34:11
<transcript>: Catamel want to make sure and say your name right? It's so hard for me to see my teleprompter today. My eyes.

13:34:18
<transcript>: We got to go, Eli and I my cofounder got to go to the cads opener.

13:34:18
<transcript>: the year

13:34:23
trivenge: he has the money

13:34:25
trivenge: lol

13:34:27
<transcript>: The year. I guess it was 2014, the year that lebron came back from Miami. Back to Cleveland. We got to go to that game and set next to lebron's. Kids.

13:34:27
<transcript>: court side

13:34:30
trivenge: gotta invest in yourself

13:34:32
<transcript>: Court Side We got to go up in the owners box and hang out with Dan gilbert and company.

13:34:32
<transcript>: it was fun

13:34:38
<transcript>: It was fun. So it was right. When we launched statues, they found this video of Statmeues thought it was amazing.

13:34:38
<transcript>: wanted to potentially

13:34:41
neochromer: Christiano Ronaldo is 38 too

13:34:43
dnbull: weird flex but ok Kappa

13:34:43
neochromer: and he pushes hard

13:34:44
thdxr: adam was like "lebrons kids are so illogical"

13:34:48
<transcript>: Wanted to potentially invest, and they invited us to the opener. So it was like this moment we were so excited for Is fans. And then we're going and we found out, like, two days before it was like.

13:34:48
<transcript>: two days before

13:35:01
kedemel: That's awesome. Did you get to experience Cleveland? It's an underrated city.

13:35:04
dnbull: Adam really just like "yeah i was next to lebron's kids and the owner while having some dinner" LMAO

13:35:06
<transcript>: Two days before Opening night, we had just launched, Statmes, trying to get it launched for the season because it's, like, peak excitement around the NBA. We got it launched. And within 48 hours, we went from nobody knew what Stabbed was to like, we're hanging out with usher, who's singing the national anthem. And like, it was just wild.

13:35:09
<transcript>: It was something I'll never forget for sure.

13:35:12
trivenge: how did dax and adam meet? thats what i want to know, their story

13:35:18
statsndata: ^

13:35:20
<transcript>: I think that's the same thing for me. More interesting players in our mindsets in the game. Yes. Yes. Me too. Lebron is not falling off. No, he is still going strong. Yeah, I guess he will. He's just a machine.

13:35:20
<transcript>: it sounds

13:35:24
<transcript>: It sounds like a million dollars on his body, doesn't he? Every year, something like that.

13:35:24
<transcript>: thirty eight

13:35:26
<transcript>: 38, is Basketball 45.

13:35:46
<transcript>: They can be weird. Once LeBron, Katie Curry gone from the NBA. Yeah. Not the era. That the last time I was really a big family NBA. It was that era. And I guess they're still there. Encourage. So good. Right. Is katie's still good? I don't even know. Lebron is generational. Yeah. He's rare. Steve nash played also very old age. Did he do? I guess he did.

13:35:53
trivenge: curry and kd still good, kd just injured all the time

13:35:54
<transcript>: Longest peaking player that will probably never be touched a long time. Yeah. Lebron and Tom Brady. They got.

13:35:54
<transcript>: drank from

13:35:56

13:35:58
<transcript>: to to

13:36:00
okufa_f: kd, curry, lebron all still good

13:36:07
neochromer: Man I can't believe there are so few Football people here :D

13:36:08
<transcript>: To to be good for a very, very long time. Well, they say Brady had like, three hall thing careers like you could slice up his career into thirds. And they were all three halls and crews.

13:36:18
<transcript>: Let's see. Say football, and then talk about egg ball. Oh, sorry. Yeah, American Football. I'm such an American. You're not finding other 33 plus year olds who aren't Legends.

13:36:20
kedemel: Mahomes can be in that conversation if he wants to play for a long time.

13:36:22
trivenge: i stopped following sports in general

13:36:23
<transcript>: You're not finding other 33 plus you're old who aren't Legends.

13:36:27
<transcript>: Or you're saying like LeBron.

13:36:27
<transcript>: you're not saying

13:36:35
<transcript>: You're not saying other people like lebron, who were legend? Yeah, yeah, I got you, lebron's. $5 million on his body alone. $5 million. Wow.

13:36:37
<transcript>: Yeah, got investing yourself sure.

13:36:39
statsndata: Sadly @neochromer also a Texans fan

13:36:40
<transcript>: Renaldo is 38 interesting.

13:36:41
okufa_f: statmuse has significantly more traction with the nba on twitter than the nfl, right?

13:36:42
<transcript>: What was the Weird flex.

13:36:42
<transcript>: the embell

13:36:45
kedemel: @triveNge Ew, Steelers.

trivenge: been that way since i was a lil kid @Kedemel

13:37:03
trivenge: they werent good when i was a kid lol

13:37:19
<transcript>: We experienced it less than we did Detroit. So Dan, Actually, after we got to go to the opener then like a couple days later, he had a slide in Detroit and made him at his office there at quicken Loans. And we got to see all of Detroit. Like he showed us the many, many buildings in Detroit that he bought and was renovating and redoing that whole city.

13:37:20
terawatthour: detroit exploration is like tomb rider, no?

13:37:24
<transcript>: Like in a big way, we got to see all that up front, up, closer, personal.

13:37:24
<transcript>: cleveland

13:37:29
<transcript>: Cleveland. We hung out a little bit in Cleveland, just around the game, but we didn't spend as much time there.

13:37:29
<transcript>: it did

13:37:33
<transcript>: It did seem nice. I mean, I had nothing bad to say about Cleveland, for sure.

13:37:39
<transcript>: The inval. I mean, I'm a sucker for the midwest, so like any midwest cities I have affection for.

13:37:39
<transcript>: vinity

13:37:41
kedemel: Yeah, Dan is a Detroit guy. He wanted to do something similar with Cleveland but I think the city didn't play nice.

13:37:42
<transcript>: Vinity. Thank you for that. Follow.

13:37:42
<transcript>: ad

13:37:47
<transcript>: Adam. Really? Just like, yeah, I was next to lebron's Kids and the owner while having some dinner.

13:37:47
<transcript>: no

13:38:07
<transcript>: No, it was surreal. It's as weird as it sounds like we're two kids from the ozarks. And we started stat muse with big dreams, like, we wanted to make it something that people cared about. We did not expect that within 48 hours after launching, we would be like hanging out at these secret rooms, at the queue in Cleveland. And like, watching lebron come back and the whole thing.

13:38:07
<transcript>: and the theatric

13:38:10
<transcript>: And the theatrics of it and.

13:38:10
<transcript>: it was just

13:38:15
<transcript>: It was just a crazy experience. And we've had some pretty cool ones since then. Like that was the very beginning.

13:38:15
<transcript>: and since then

13:38:17
kedemel: @triveNge Browns fan here. They haven't been good since I was a baby, lol.

13:38:21
<transcript>: And since then, we've gotten to do some cool stuff. We've reported with a bunch of athletes and Studios, like record their voices.

13:38:21
<transcript>: so

13:38:26
<transcript>: So met a lot of prominent NFL players, mostly.

13:38:33
trivenge: ah i see why you said that then @Kedemel  lol

13:38:33
<transcript>: I've had a lot of people invest, like owners and teams and leagues. We just, like, interacted with a lot of people in sports.

13:38:33
<transcript>: that we just

13:38:38
<transcript>: That we just never would have thought that it was headed. Distraction. Okay.

13:38:46
<transcript>: How did daxon atom meet? That's what I want to know. Their story. All right, triv, me and dax, it was a Tuesday.

13:38:46
<transcript>: a rain

13:38:52
<transcript>: A rainy Tuesday afternoon just making that up. Actually, I had tox on my podcast when I had an aws podcast.

13:38:53
<transcript>: And.

13:38:56
<transcript>: We had known each other from Twitter.

13:39:00
<transcript>: I gotta go back and listen to that podcast. Acts. That's funny.

13:39:00
<transcript>: we were

13:39:04
<transcript>: We were on a podcast. And then I had him on the podcast again.

13:39:04
<transcript>: and then

13:39:14
thdxr: I was the only one adam knew with a flexible schedule

13:39:17
<transcript>: And then the rest is history. Pseudo bangbang. Thank you so much. Fat. Follow. We're gonna actually write some code here in a minute. I'm feeling inspired. And we've got another hour left. We're gonna do some stuff. We're gonna do this musings page. Maybe we'll just get it done.

13:39:20
thdxr: and spent as much time on twitter

13:39:22
thdxr: that's all it takes

13:39:26
kedemel: @triveNge Yep. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't jealous of your recent success and stability. Cowher to Tomlin. Practically no worse than an average season. It's incredible what that organization has been able to do, even if they haven't been snatching up Super Bowl after Super Bowl.

13:39:27
<transcript>: Korea. Katie still good. Katie just injured all the time. Yeah, I think I remember that. I think Katie had been injured. A lot like heating the straight to Nets. Originally, there's a lot of injury stuff.

13:39:31
<transcript>: I can't believe there are so few football people here.

13:39:31
<transcript>: do you mean foot

13:39:34
<transcript>: Do you mean Football football, or American football.

13:39:34
<transcript>: the home

13:39:43
<transcript>: The homes can be in that conversation if you wants to play for a long time. Yeah, he's special. I don't know if he'll have the longevity thing. You just can't predict that. But.

13:39:43
<transcript>: in terms of

13:39:45
<transcript>: In terms of.

13:39:45
<transcript>: just

13:39:47
<transcript>: Just talent he's he's fun to watch.

13:39:47
<transcript>: stop

13:39:54
neochromer: Fooball - Football the Real one :D no egghand thingy

13:39:56
<transcript>: Stop following sports in general. My family and myself is a sealer sand when it comes to football. Yeah. So I will say I don't watch football like my family.

13:39:56
<transcript>: we're not

13:40:00
<transcript>: We're not like we don't want our boys to play football. If I'm being honest, I played football.

13:40:00
<transcript>: i just

13:40:14
<transcript>: I just don't feel like it's a good choice for my kids. Personally, I'm not shaming anybody else but America and Football, it's just it's pretty. We know a lot more about repeated head trauma than we did 20 years ago.

13:40:14
<transcript>: so

13:40:15
<transcript>: So.

13:40:15
<transcript>: yeah

13:40:33
<transcript>: Yeah. We don't watch football in the house. I get to kind of like, watch it under the radar, like I watch highlights the next day, that kind of thing. And then when the Super Bowl, the deal is if the Chiefs make the Super Bowl, I watch the Super Bowl. So I do that one night. I don't tuck my boys in that night when the Chiefs are inevitably in the Super Bowl because they're super good.

13:40:33
<transcript>: i've got

13:40:36
<transcript>: I've gotten to watch the Super Bowls. That's all I do.

13:40:47
<transcript>: A Texans fan. Oof, I'm so sorry, Neocromer. I'm so sorry, because I can't think of a more depressing organization than the Texans.

13:40:47
<transcript>: what

13:40:49
<transcript>: What are you guys up to.

13:40:52
<transcript>: Like, really. And I follow the League pretty closely.

13:40:52
<transcript>: the texans

13:40:55
<transcript>: The texans, oof.

13:40:55
<transcript>: just

13:40:59
<transcript>: Just a tough situation when your owners suck, it's just kind of hard.

13:41:01
<transcript>: To go anywhere, I guess.

13:41:01
<transcript>: stem

13:41:05
trivenge: @Kedemel they have done pretty well and remained fairly stable for a good while, gotta admit. i mean either way, the entire league had to endure a long battle with the goat tom brady though lol

13:41:06
<transcript>: Stem use has significantly more traction with the with the NBA on Twitter than.

13:41:06
<transcript>: the

13:41:07
<transcript>: The.

13:41:07
<transcript>: sometimes

13:41:11
<transcript>: Sometimes this thing gets in my way and I can't read your messages.

13:41:13
<transcript>: Then the what.

13:41:16
trivenge: like facing MJ but for football lol

13:41:24
<transcript>: Then the man, then the NFL, right? Yes. Stat. Muse is still mostly like an mba thing I would say. I think that's fair.

13:41:25
cowfacedev: wow. I am completely out of context LUL

13:41:28
<transcript>: Because we started is MBA.

13:41:28
<transcript>: and i think

13:41:31
<transcript>: And I think NBA Twitter is probably more.

13:41:31
<transcript>: rabid

13:41:33
<transcript>: Rabid than like NFL Twitter.

13:41:34
kedemel: High School Football is rough. Especially in the big HSF states, like in the midwest. Ultra competitive.

13:41:43
<transcript>: So I would say Statme's definitely has more traction with NBA. We make more content around the NBA. I think the team skews more NBA fan than anything.

13:41:45
<transcript>: Yeah.

13:41:45
<transcript>: because

13:41:46
<transcript>: Because.

13:41:48
trivenge: makes sense

13:41:57
<transcript>: Trivia was a sealer sand. My uncle. Was this feeler saying? But Triv.

13:41:57
<transcript>: km

13:42:04
<transcript>: Kml says ew to the steelers been that waste little kid. They weren't good when I was a kid.

13:42:07
<transcript>: Detroit Exploration is like tomb rider.

13:42:12
<transcript>: No, it's they've done a lot to revitalize. Detroit.

13:42:12
<transcript>: d

13:42:29
<transcript>: Dan gilbert bought like most of the skyline. And they put in private security, like they have cameras on the streets of Detroit that are not the police force. It's a private security force that Dan has literally like, put in place to make Detroit better. I guess. I don't know.

13:42:29
<transcript>: david's

13:42:35
<transcript>: David's, Detroit guy. He wanted to do something similar with Cleveland, but I think the city didn't play an ica. I remember hearing about it.

13:42:35
<transcript>: brown

13:42:38
<transcript>: Brown. Ten. Here. They haven't been good since I was a baby.

13:42:41
nkoalabear: that doesnt sound good lol

13:42:41
<transcript>: The Browns, The Browns.

13:42:41
<transcript>: it seemed like

13:42:45
<transcript>: It seemed like they were on the up and up, right there were an upandcoming.

13:42:45
<transcript>: af

13:42:47
terawatthour: "private security force" doesnt really sound better than police does it

13:42:47
<transcript>: Afc team and then.

13:42:47
<transcript>: it

13:42:53
<transcript>: It has not gone well with the guy. The creepy guy. The quarterback. What's his name.

13:42:53
<transcript>: kn

13:42:55
<transcript>: Knock on, well.

13:42:55
<transcript>: hopefully

13:42:58
kedemel: Deshaun Watson.

13:42:59
<transcript>: Hopefully he can still play the guitar. I don't know.

13:42:59
<transcript>: but first

13:43:00
<transcript>: But first.

13:43:00
<transcript>: for like the

13:43:04
<transcript>: For, like the story of it. I kind of like that he sucks because he's awful.

13:43:04
<transcript>: just from

13:43:14
<transcript>: Just from the I mean, that many people don't allege you allege. Why does my hat keep falling off that many people don't say you did a bad thing if you didn't do a lot of bad things, you know what I mean.

13:43:17
statsndata: I know you probably don't want to be viewed as "enemies" per say, but how do you see Bball-ref when you think of the future of statmuse?

13:43:21
<transcript>: But the Brown seemed like they were they were going places and you still got the I mean Nick, chubs and machine.

13:43:28
<transcript>: Yeah. Anyway, see why you said that I was the only one Adam New, with a flexible schedule.

13:43:28
<transcript>: as much time on twitter

13:43:30
<transcript>: As much time on Twitter. That's all it takes? Yeah.

13:43:34
<transcript>: That's a good accurate description.

13:43:34
<transcript>: okay

13:43:43
<transcript>: Okay, I'm getting behind again because I spend so much time opining. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't jealous of your recent success and stability.

13:43:43
kedemel: Deshaun Watson has made a lot of fans question our love of the team.

13:43:48
statsndata: You've definitely got the visual appeal, but I assume Bball-ref has the database behind them.

13:43:59
<transcript>: Cow hertz. Oh, yeah. You had great coaches with the steelers. Practically no worries than an average season. It's incredible what the organization's been able to do, even if they haven't been. Yeah, they just haven't had talent. If the sealers just had talent, man, everything else they got, they got in spades.

13:44:01
statsndata: historical data* database

13:44:02
<transcript>: No egghand zingy. I love it neocrover.

13:44:02
<transcript>: okay

13:44:03
<transcript>: Okay.

13:44:07
trivenge: we should do a podcast with dax, adam, hillier-smith (Hayden Hillier-Smith edited for top-name talents like Logan Paul, Sam & Colby, Alex Wassabi, and more. In 2020, he won the Streamy for best editing), and myself. we can like, talk about editing and nerdy things

13:44:13
<transcript>: Gonna keep scrolling. Yeah, no, it's okay. Cafes. We're bringing this back out of NFL Talk. I'm gonna get back to coding some satiny stuff.

13:44:13
<transcript>: welcome

13:44:16
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat koala Bear. That doesn't sound good.

13:44:16
<transcript>: what happened

13:44:31
<transcript>: What happened? High school football's rep, especially in the big high school football States, like in the midwest. Ultra competitive. Yeah, yeah. I grew up in a fullball town. Like our high school, our whole city, our whole little town of 2000. People just revolved around the football team.

13:44:31
<transcript>: so

13:44:36
<transcript>: So like as football playball players, we could do no wrong. Like literally.

13:44:36
<transcript>: we were

13:44:47
<transcript>: We were worshipped, but like, it's kind of creepy when you look back on it as an adult. Like how much that little community, just like that's all they had going. So that's what they were into.

13:44:49
trivenge: yeah

13:44:51
<transcript>: And it was very competitive. So the schools in our area, like it was just a very.

13:44:56
<transcript>: Steroid usage with a thing. I mean it's sad, but like high school football.

13:44:56
<transcript>: in the

13:44:57
trivenge: yup

13:45:00
<transcript>: In the ozarks. A lot of that going around.

13:45:11
trivenge: steroid usage is a thing, saw it in wrestling too in a super small school

13:45:18
<transcript>: Yeah, it was the thing. It was an interesting scene to be in private. Security force. Doesn't really sound better than police, does it? No, I don't. Yeah, I don't know. I guess. Like if you don't feel like the city is doing a good job, you hire your own. If you're Dan gilbert and have billions of dollars, I don't know. The Sean Watson. There we go. That's the name.

13:45:19
trivenge: i graduated with 68 in my class LUL

13:45:21
<transcript>: Okay.

13:45:22
kedemel: Yep. Same. WR and DB here. It can get shady.

13:45:31
<transcript>: I know you probably don't want to be viewed as enemies per se, but how do you see Beatball ref when you think of a future for statmes? So it's interesting. We hired.

13:45:31
<transcript>: justin pat

13:45:33
<transcript>: Justin patgo, who created.

13:45:33
<transcript>: basketball reference

13:45:35
<transcript>: Basketball reference.

13:45:37
<transcript>: He worked for us for five years.

13:45:37
<transcript>: and

13:45:42
<transcript>: And all the data that Basketball Reference has we also have.

13:45:42
<transcript>: same for

13:45:46
<transcript>: Same for the other four in North American Sports. We're basically the same database as Sports reference.

13:45:46
<transcript>: and even

13:45:53
<transcript>: And even Justin for five years made our database a little better. So it actually has a little more comprehensive data than the sports reference sites.

13:45:55
cowfacedev: can I drop a nix article in here?

13:45:59
statsndata: Wow that's amazing

13:46:09
<transcript>: So we have them, like in terms of the data picture, we're at least on par. But a lot of journalists still, they're so used to using sports weapon sites, they're never gonna switch over to sat mes because it just feels like, what do I gain? I have to learn how to ask questions on status.

13:46:12
trivenge: if you dont, im just gonna be disappointed that you are not abusing your mod privileges NotLikeThis  @cowFaceDev

13:46:15
<transcript>: And that's okay.

13:46:15
<transcript>: we

13:46:28
<transcript>: We don't we don't probably do as well in the journalism segment of People. But sports betters and fantasy players use statmes a lot. And that's because they find, like a few things they can do on stat muse, and they know exactly how to do it. And they do it a whole lot.

13:46:28
<transcript>: like seeing

13:46:40
<transcript>: Like seeing how a player performs against a certain team, that kind of thing. They just hammer those kind of those kind of queries. So we do get like, probably a younger crowd, less journalism, more sports betting.

13:46:40
<transcript>: and we're fine

13:46:45
<transcript>: And we're fine with it. I don't really view the sports driven sites as competitors.

13:46:58
<transcript>: Because we don't have a paid offering. If we were selling a subscription, if we will be, then I'll start to view people as competitors. Maybe. But when we're not even really like charging for anything we do, it feels hard to like view anybody that way.

13:47:02
<transcript>: Deshawn Watson has made a lot of fans.

13:47:02
<transcript>: question our love

13:47:08
<transcript>: Question our love of the team. Yeah, yeah. So I listen to, like, Football podcast. I'm such a nerd.

13:47:26
neochromer: @adamdotdev can you ELI5 what statmuse ist?

13:47:28
neochromer: is*

13:47:29
<transcript>: Other people may be listened to technical podcasts. I don't know. I listen to around the NFL. And Mark Ceciler saying this Brown fan just totally quit his fandom, right? For the Browns over the Sean Watson thing. And he's like a lifelong Brown fan. You definitely got the visual appeal, but I assume be ball ref has the database behind them. Yeah. So I think I.

13:47:29
<transcript>: just explain

13:47:33
neochromer: just a place where I can see stats of players?

13:47:38
<transcript>: Just explained we actually have same data. Okay. Should do a podcast with dax, Adam hillier, Smith, hayden, Heal, your Smith edited.

13:47:38
<transcript>: for top

13:47:43
<transcript>: For top name talents like Logan. Paul saying, oh, I've seen his stuff. I see this stuff on YouTube.

13:47:43
<transcript>: when he

13:47:47
thdxr: I know nothing baout sports

13:47:55
<transcript>: When he won the streaming for Best editing. Yeah, he's super good. I've watched some of his YouTube myself. We can like talk about editing and nerdy things. Ooh sounds good to me. Steroid usage is saying solid and wrestling to in a super small school. Yeah.

13:47:55
<transcript>: gradu

13:47:59
<transcript>: Graduate. 68 in your class. Yeah. We had about 90 in my class. So.

13:47:59
<transcript>: our

13:48:01
<transcript>: Our Will Springs High School is like.

13:48:01
<transcript>: a d

13:48:04
<transcript>: A. D to 100 in each class.

13:48:09
<transcript>: Look at you. Catamel was a wide receiver in DB.

13:48:09
<transcript>: it can get

13:48:11
<transcript>: It can get shady, it definitely can.

13:48:11
<transcript>: drop

13:48:18
thdxr: I played sports but never watched

13:48:19
<transcript>: Drop a nick's article in here. Go for it, Cafe. So let's just skew things back toward nerds. Let's just get talking about tech again.

13:48:19
<transcript>: i have talked

13:48:21
<transcript>: I have talked for most of the stream today.

13:48:24
cowfacedev: https://itsfoss.com/home-manager-nixos/

13:48:25
<transcript>: And then dax, I are gonna record a podcast. I'm not gonna have a voice left.

13:48:27
trivenge: !focus

13:48:30
<transcript>: If you don't, I'm just gonna be disappointed that you are not abusing your.

13:48:30
<transcript>: admin

13:48:35
<transcript>: Admin privileges. Can you explain, like I'm five? What that means is.

13:48:35
<transcript>: yes

13:48:37
<transcript>: Yes.

13:48:37
<transcript>: i can

13:48:38
<transcript>: I can.

13:48:41
<transcript>: Dax, you play sports. Never watch.

13:48:48
<transcript>: So here's what that means is stat. Muse is a place.

13:48:48
<transcript>: so

13:48:55
<transcript>: So we started out, let's just go to the home page. We started out as just this, like searching for sports stats.

13:48:55
<transcript>: so

13:48:57
<transcript>: So.

13:49:01
trivenge: i enjoyed playing more than i did watching when i look back at it all @thdxr  lol

13:49:03
<transcript>: Who scored the morse scored the most points in a game.

13:49:03
<transcript>: and

13:49:08
statsndata: Don't forget to work on the musings 😭😂

13:49:20
<transcript>: And used to it was just mba. Now we support all these sports. So we have to, like, ask you clarifying questions. But and then you get an answer like this chart of wilt chamberlain. They kind of start out, just charge or a table. It would just be this table that it would dump on you. And then we started adding things like natural language generation.

13:49:22
trivenge: does statsmuse have chatgpt built in?

13:49:35
<transcript>: And we have this illustrator that makes all these illustrations for players. But yeah, it's basically just like, ask questions about sports. Get answers. That's statmes. I don't know if I explain that like your five because I'm bad with kids.

13:49:35
<transcript>: we've just

13:49:35
neochromer: Nice

13:49:37
trivenge: to go with the trend and hype? LUL

13:49:38
<transcript>: We've just covered this on this very stream.

13:49:38
<transcript>: yeah

13:49:40
<transcript>: Yeah. So there you go.

13:49:40
<transcript>: the semus

13:49:41
neochromer: where do you get the data?

13:49:45
<transcript>: The semus have gpt built in. Not yet. Maybe soon. We'll see.

13:49:45
<transcript>: don't

13:49:47
neochromer: Google or something open source?

13:49:49
glamshatterskull: yeah you can ask statmuse to program itself

13:49:55
<transcript>: Don't forget to work on the music. Yeah, let's do it. Fascinated. We're gonna do the musing. So when you go to savvy's. Com, we have these little like tidbits that we post. We also posted like this on Twitter.

13:50:00
<transcript>: We call them musings. They're like little facts. Just like.

13:50:00
<transcript>: little

13:50:03
<transcript>: Little Pieces of media.

13:50:03
<transcript>: and

13:50:08
cowfacedev: @triveNge I am a `one of the guys who is around` mod. not someone who uses the mod privileges at all, let alone abuse them LUL

13:50:13
<transcript>: And I've got each of them has a url associated with it. So musings. And then there's this big, long thing. And I gotta make sure that when you hit these pages on the new site.

13:50:13
<transcript>: that we

13:50:22
<transcript>: That we render the page exactly as we render it here. And currently I do nothing because I've created the route, but nothing's there. So we gotta render this.

13:50:22
<transcript>: for this

13:50:32
<transcript>: For this music, and the way we do that is there's a table and a postgres database that I need to query when you hit this particular slug.

13:50:37
<transcript>: So who's used a postgres client that they love.

13:50:39
<transcript>: Ideally.

13:50:39
<transcript>: very modern

13:50:43
<transcript>: Very modern and typescript friendly anybody.

13:50:43
<transcript>: dax i feel

13:50:45
thdxr: wait wait wait

13:50:46
trivenge: no worries, it was a joke @cowFaceDev  lol

13:50:48
thdxr: this is my friggin area of expertise

13:50:51
<transcript>: Dax, I feel like you're gonna have a recommendation here. They actually always have good recommendations. I need you to perk up. Wait, wait. Tell me what to use for postgres.

13:50:51
neochromer: postgres client?

13:50:55
<transcript>: Gimme.

13:50:56
fragaverage: pg LUL

13:50:59

13:51:21
thdxr: look how many views it got!

13:51:25
okufa_f: i saw this video a couple days ago haha, i should try the orm

13:51:26
thdxr: yeah I can lol

13:51:26
<transcript>: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

13:51:34
vapor__dev: he loves prisma

13:51:35
trivenge: are we about to review dax's video?

13:51:35
<transcript>: My music's playing dax and I I thought you said.

13:51:35
<transcript>: look

13:51:38
trivenge: POGGERS

13:51:47
<transcript>: Look, you all love prisma. But it's just bad. That's what I heard. And I was like, this is so spicy. But the music was the thing. That's not what you said. He said it's just a fact or something.

13:51:51
<transcript>: Who do we want to review? Doctor's Video? No, I'm not gonna do that.

13:51:57
<transcript>: I saw this video a couple days ago. Try the over it.

13:51:59
thdxr: if you don't need to manage the schema, you can just use kysely probably pretty simple

13:52:00
<transcript>: 's that what you're saying? Dax, use drizzle.

13:52:02
statsndata: Drizzle this project Adam lol

13:52:04
thdxr: but Drizzle is what we're recommending to everyone

13:52:04
<transcript>: If you don't need to manage the schema.

13:52:07
<transcript>: Just use kaisely. Probably pretty simple.

13:52:12
<transcript>: But Drizzle. Is what we're recommending to everyone. Okay, let's drizzle the project.

13:52:16
<transcript>: Let's drizzle a little bit on the project, you know.

13:52:16
<transcript>: that's

13:52:17
trivenge: dax, i dislike videos where its all talking heads, I NEED RETENTION DAX

13:52:20
<transcript>: That's a fun name. I've seen the drizzle guys on Twitter.

13:52:22
trivenge: RETAIN MY EYES

13:52:24
thdxr: Drizzle might be a lto if you're not making changes to the schema

13:52:24
trivenge: LUL

13:52:24
kryotoboi: Oh so Dax is watching adam watch dax HolidaySanta

13:52:29
<transcript>: Trip says he needs retention. Did you not do any retention? Hacks? Oh, he did look at this.

13:52:29
<transcript>: look at this

13:52:31
<transcript>: Look at this retention hack. I'm interested.

13:52:34
<transcript>: Hot new open source library.

13:52:37
<transcript>: Dax is getting good at the YouTube stuff.

13:52:40
thdxr: this video did 100x better than any of our videos

13:52:42
<transcript>: I have no authority to say that because I'm not good at YouTube, but.

13:52:42
<transcript>: nax

13:52:44
<transcript>: Nax is he's doing some stuff? Look at this.

13:52:44
<transcript>: okay

13:52:48
<transcript>: Okay, a little more breaking away from your face decks. That's my recommendation.

13:52:48
<transcript>: that's what i learned from

13:52:50
<transcript>: That's what I learned from Mr. Beast.

13:52:54
<transcript>: That's good though.

13:52:56
<transcript>: He's done some stuff.

13:52:59
<transcript>: He's doing it. Trip.

13:52:59
<transcript>: this video did

13:53:05
trivenge: thats great

13:53:05
<transcript>: This video did a hundred times better than any of our videos. A hundred times 180 views. Look at you guys.

13:53:05
<transcript>: look at you

13:53:07
<transcript>: Look at you.

13:53:09
<transcript>: What do you remember? What.

13:53:09
<transcript>: your

13:53:11
<transcript>: Your what you're like.

13:53:11
<transcript>: oh no

13:53:18
trivenge: its all an improvement over time SeemsGood

13:53:28
thdxr: lemme see

13:53:29
<transcript>: Oh, no, I'm not gonna get into the analytics thing because they don't matter. This did good. This is a great video. I don't know if they matter. And I'm just gonna say things I don't know anything about. I'm just curious. Like how the retention looked. How did the engagement look? Because I've seen a lot of my video engagement. I'm just curious. Like did people watch it? You know.

13:53:29
<transcript>: average view

13:53:31
<transcript>: Average view duration. Okay, I said it fine.

13:53:36
<transcript>: So, dax is watching Adam. Watch dax. Yes.

13:53:39
<transcript>: Retain my eyes.

13:53:45
lucca_rodrigues: i watched this video and it was a certified banger, good job dax

13:53:46
<transcript>: Trip says, okay, so we're gonna use drizzle. How do I use drizzle? We're about five out.

13:53:48
thdxr: check kysely first to see if it'll work

13:53:58
<transcript>: This one might be a lot if you're not making changes to schema.

13:53:58
<transcript>: i'm not

13:54:00
<transcript>: I'm not.

13:54:00
<transcript>: i'm not

13:54:01
<transcript>: I'm not yet.

13:54:01
<transcript>: okay so

13:54:03
<transcript>: Okay. So we use kaisely first.

13:54:07
<transcript>: Kisley first.

13:54:07
<transcript>: if we

13:54:11
<transcript>: If we find out we need Drizzle. We always use drizzle.

13:54:16
<transcript>: I think I have used Kaisely before.

13:54:19
thdxr: ty!

13:54:22
<transcript>: I think.

13:54:26
<transcript>: So I just needed kaisely.

13:54:27
okufa_f: i tend to be apprehensive of newer tech because im all for maturity @thdxr is drizzle production secure?

13:54:28
<transcript>: Out.

13:54:28
<transcript>: how do i

13:54:30
<transcript>: How do I define the schema.

13:54:37
midnightcomm: Can you explain what SST is and how to use it for a new project? Having a hard time wrapping my head around what SST is as an aspiring dev.

13:54:44
thdxr: you can define it manually _or_ use `kysely-codegen` to generate it automatically

13:54:48
<transcript>: How do I use? How do I define the schema? Don't you have to define the schema on something else for Kaisely or something? Are you doing typescript.

13:54:51
<transcript>: Kaisely code Gen. Okay.

13:54:51
<transcript>: can you explain

13:54:57
kedemel: It cracks me up watching the JS community work on solving things that are ancient in the .NET world.

13:54:58
<transcript>: Can you explain what sst is and how to use it for a new project? Having a hard time wrapping my head around what ssd is as an aspiring Dev.

13:55:00
<transcript>: Hey, midnight? Welcome to chat.

13:55:00
<transcript>: i

13:55:03
<transcript>: I bet dax could describe it.

13:55:05
kryotoboi: Yeah anytime I eat near my keyboard I end up drizzling food all over  NotLikeThis

13:55:10
thdxr: SST is Some Stupid Thing don't use it

13:55:10
<transcript>: Crack me up, watching the js community work on solving things that are ancient, the Net world.

13:55:13
<transcript>: Entity framework. Am. All right.

13:55:20
<transcript>: Ssd is some stupid thing. Don't use it, dax. You need a pitch, dax, you should really work on your pitch.

13:55:20
<transcript>: that's not a pitch

13:55:21
trivenge: thats a good name though

13:55:21
<transcript>: That's not a pitch.

13:55:21
<transcript>: saying

typosrry: sup peeps

13:55:25
<transcript>: Saying it's, saying it's stupid. Don't use it. Or is it reverse psychology.

13:55:28
<transcript>: Maybe.

13:55:28
<transcript>: what's

13:55:29
trivenge: humans do the opposite of what they are told

13:55:30
<transcript>: What's going on? Typo. Sorry.

13:55:30
trivenge: revers,e yes

13:55:37
trivenge: dont use it? more like, use it!

13:55:37
<transcript>: Yes. Reverse psychology. The humans do the opposite. So we're gonna install kaisely.

13:55:42
kryotoboi: Vbscript > javascript ?

13:55:43
trivenge: LUL

13:55:44
<transcript>: Postgres. Here we go.

13:55:44
<transcript>: kaisely

13:55:46
<transcript>: Kaisely, and PG.

13:55:52
kedemel: I used to hate EntityFramework. It's finally in a decent spot.

13:55:55
<transcript>: I love all J so much I love with this.

13:55:55
<transcript>: spotify

13:55:57
<transcript>: Spotify radio takes me into some all day.

13:56:00
thdxr: Drizzle even has a way to define schema with it and then infer types for kysely - amazing!

13:56:04
<transcript>: Typos. Sorry. Thank you so much for the prime sub.

13:56:07
<transcript>: Prime subs hit different you know.

13:56:07
<transcript>: just feels good to

13:56:08
typosrry: here is my europoor prime sub LUL

13:56:11
<transcript>: Just feels good to know that you had one prime setup, and you chose to use it on me.

13:56:11
<transcript>: i really

13:56:14
neochromer: @thdxr last time i deployed something to AWS was using Beanstalk / Beanstack forgot the name, how does SST differ from that?

13:56:14
mecoupz: entity framework is cool, despite many people hating it

13:56:15
<transcript>: I really appreciate that. Here's. My Europor Prime sub.

13:56:18
trivenge: !prime

13:56:19
<transcript>: You're a poor what's that mean.

13:56:19
<transcript>: drizzle

13:56:20
<transcript>: Drizzle.

13:56:20
<transcript>: has even

13:56:25
<transcript>: Has even has a way to define schema with it and then infer types for kaisely amazing.

13:56:27
<transcript>: Okay.

13:56:30
typosrry: european LUL

13:56:33
<transcript>: So Kitamel, I haven't used any framework for like eight years. It's finally in a decent spot, like I would enjoy it if I went back to it.

13:56:36
<transcript>: I remember it was pretty beachy.

13:56:36
<transcript>: pretty

13:56:38
<transcript>: Pretty pretty large.

13:56:38
<transcript>: last time i deployed

13:56:44
thdxr: @NeoChromer it's roughly 918239132x less painful as we witnessed with adam

13:56:46
<transcript>: Last time I deployed something, it'd be a was using beanstalk. I forgot the name. Yeah. Elastic beansock. How does this see? Differ from that? Ooh, dax, you should have a field day with this.

13:56:52
neochromer: oof

13:56:53
neochromer: sold

13:56:57
<transcript>: It's roughly that many times less painful. It's true. It's much less painful than any framework. It's like, Sorry, then. Elastic, Beanstock.

13:56:57
<transcript>: it is

13:57:04
<transcript>: It is like if you like modern web dev, you like writing typescript and all of the great modern frameworks.

13:57:08
thdxr: SST is a full framework for what we think the best way to build applications on AWS is (which is TS + serverless)

13:57:14
<transcript>: That SSDs like that. But building AWS backend and you don't have to think about AWS really you have to create your account and then it's just like building good applications.

13:57:14
<transcript>: with

13:57:16
<transcript>: With proven techniques.

13:57:20
<transcript>: The full framework for what we think the best way to build applications on aws is.

13:57:20
<transcript>: i would

13:57:20
neochromer: nice

13:57:29
neochromer: does it calculte costs? :D

13:57:38
kedemel: They rebuilt EntityFramework from scratch when they moved from .NET Framework to .NET Core. It's not so entirely different that you'd be completely lost getting back into it, but it's different enough to notice the improvements.

13:57:40
<transcript>: I would go further. Dax, it's not even the best way to build applications on aws, it is, but it's the best way to build applications. I think too many people just build a versaille app. They build like Next js, and it's like api wraps hit my database. I'm done. But like, if you build a real startup, a real startup, this sounds so gatekeepy. I don't even like this. The idea of gatekeeping, but like if you're building something that other.

13:57:40
<transcript>: people are going to be

13:57:44
trivenge: gatekeeping NotLikeThis

13:57:51
thdxr: I mean this is something that needs to be said but hard to say

13:57:58
thdxr: LOLD

13:58:00
<transcript>: People are going to be paying for and you're gonna like raise money and build this thing with a team. I think the next api route thing falls over so fast. It's great for hobby projects and like which pokemon's fatter or whatever. But like if you really want to build something, I think you should probably use aws, if you're gonna build on ABS sst is just buy a million times the best way to do it.

13:58:01
thdxr: which pokemon is fatter

13:58:03
glamshatterskull: snorlax

13:58:03
<transcript>: Okay.

13:58:07
glamshatterskull: walord

13:58:10
<transcript>: Which pokemon is better. Yeah. I mean like that's the kind of stuff. Sure. It looks great in an xjs app.

thdxr: it was ROUNDER

13:58:12
thdxr: not fatter

13:58:17
trivenge: we need a startup that pays people like triv to just become a developer so he can change the video world LUL

13:58:19
<transcript>: They rebuilt Energy Framework from scratch when they move from Net Framework to Net core. Okay, it's not so entirely different that you'd be completely lost into this. Different enough to know the improvements. Interesting.

13:58:25
<transcript>: This is something that needs to be said but hard to say.

13:58:27
midnightcomm: Ahhh thanks! I was headed down the vervet route but the costs for vercel is so expensive for what it is

13:58:29
glamshatterskull: do we know pokemons bmi?

13:58:37
<transcript>: Round are not fatter. I'm sorry. Oh, was that an actual one that? Am I referring something in my brain that I forgot about? Did somebody actually build that? And I'm just like, calling it out. I didn't mean to call something out.

13:58:37
thdxr: theo made that

13:58:40
lucca_rodrigues: throwing shade at theo with roundest mon, sheeeesh

13:58:42
<transcript>: Oh.

13:58:43
kryotoboi: As devs can we threaten to not use Aws anymore and get Amazon to do as we please LUL

13:58:44
<transcript>: I'm Sorry, the.

13:58:44
<transcript>: i was not trying

13:58:44
thdxr: you called out theo lol

13:58:46
<transcript>: I was not trying to call the o out.

13:58:49
thdxr: imma clip that

13:58:50
<transcript>: I didn't go out to you. Stop it.

13:58:51
thdxr: and send it

13:58:54
trivenge: TWITCH DRAMA

13:58:55
<transcript>: Clip. It was in. Okay, fine.

13:58:57
vapor__dev: we got beef people!!

13:58:59
<transcript>: Do your worst, dax, do your worst.

13:59:00
typosrry: I don't know how scalable nextjs api endpoints are, like can I expect it to crash when 3000 users request something at the same time?

13:59:01
<transcript>: Dead champ. Thank you so much for follow.

13:59:01
<transcript>: now i

13:59:05
thdxr: BEEF ALERT

13:59:05
<transcript>: Now I think there's a place for, like, showing how you can quickly build something.

13:59:05
<transcript>: with a piece

13:59:06
thdxr: MOOO

13:59:09
<transcript>: With a piece technology. I'm just saying, like.

13:59:09
<transcript>: people are

13:59:10
<transcript>: People are stop.

13:59:15
<transcript>: You know, I'm prothio. I love Theo.

13:59:18
vapor__dev: sound the alarm!!

13:59:22
<transcript>: I don't know how scale but next JS API endpoints are like can I expect it to crash when 30 users request something at the same time.

13:59:25
<transcript>: So the problem is like.

13:59:31
<transcript>: Once your thing actually has usaged and versello is going to come knocking.

13:59:31
<transcript>: and you're gonna pay

13:59:36
<transcript>: And you're gonna pay some big enterprise bill and you really would have been better off on aws, I promise you.

13:59:39
<transcript>: Promise you.

13:59:43
<transcript>: What am I doing? I installed kaisely.

13:59:43
<transcript>: let's go

13:59:47
<transcript>: Let's go to go to the musings page.

13:59:49
thdxr: also there's more to an application than an HTTP request

13:59:50
<transcript>: Pages using Here, go.

13:59:50
<transcript>: oh it's completely

13:59:53
<transcript>: Oh, it's completely empty. It's literally empty.

13:59:58
trivenge: is it worth even considering competitors to aws?

13:59:58
thdxr: adam how are you going to connect to the db locally?

13:59:58
<transcript>: Also, there's more to an application than an hp http request. Exactly.

13:59:58
<transcript>: you cannot

14:00:02
<transcript>: You cannot model your entire application off of a request.

14:00:02
<transcript>: to an

14:00:04
neochromer: I also think that AWS handles scalability better

14:00:05
<transcript>: To an api, and a response like.

14:00:05
<transcript>: q

14:00:09
dnbull: That needs to be a video.. inform people why. My beef with twitter is the "dont use this" and dont elaborate

14:00:16
<transcript>: Q's are one of the more fundamental cues Cron jobs like these fundamental things that anybody building an application eventually runs into a situation where, like, I need a thing to run.

14:00:16
<transcript>: on some interval

14:00:17
<transcript>: On some interval.

14:00:17
<transcript>: and i

14:00:18
thdxr: lol it zoomed in on your face when you said queues

14:00:24
<transcript>: And I know now next day has that, but like it just hits your api route, right? Like I don't know.

14:00:30
<transcript>: I've heard people use github accents for this. And it just makes me so sad. Like there are good primitive services.

14:00:30
<transcript>: for doing this

14:00:31
<transcript>: For doing this.

14:00:31
<transcript>: in a tobl

14:00:36
<transcript>: In a tobls if people are so scared of AWS that they won't even just like spin the.

14:00:39
<transcript>: 30 minutes.

14:00:40
glamshatterskull: don't be sad

14:00:46
<transcript>: A. Cues.

14:00:53
<transcript>: Adam, how are you going to connect to the db locally? I am on a vpn. We have a vpn at stapmes.

14:00:53
<transcript>: i've now

14:00:54
vapor__dev: "30 minutes" LUL

14:00:56
<transcript>: I've now been connected for 123 hours.

14:01:00
<transcript>: So I'm going to connect to it over the VPN.

14:01:02
trivenge: LUL

14:01:05
okufa_f: the reason why i've been avoiding aws is because i've heard it hits the wallet pretty hard

14:01:06
lucca_rodrigues: wait so you're telling me you don't use endless http polling for real-time data smh /s

14:01:10
<transcript>: Is it worth even considering competitors? Aws, I don't think so. Ada visits just so much better at serverless that I don't think it's worth it.

14:01:25
<transcript>: Now things like planet scalescale. So like vertical specific, like things that are really good at their thing like planet scale way better than rds. Sure like dax talked about in this podcast on syntax. Like there are.

14:01:25
<transcript>: there are

14:01:33
daglee: Do you own a fancy japanese toilet?

14:01:40
<transcript>: There are Upstash. I would never use elasticache because Upstach exists. There are like vinyls that are creating a better dx over top of A Tobis primitives. Those are fantastic, but I wouldn't consider like Google Cloud or azure if that's what you mean. I guess Cloud flare.

14:01:40
<transcript>: that's

14:01:44
<transcript>: That's a competitor that is good.

14:01:45
trivenge: could cost be a primary motivator to consider another alternative? but would that cost you more in the long run in doing so?

14:01:51
<transcript>: It's. There's a lot to it. It's a nuanced conversation, and I'm not very smart, so I don't have all the answers.

14:01:55
statsndata: AWS has market share for one reason.  Keeps market share for a separate reason.

14:01:59
<transcript>: Exactly. Luca.

14:02:04
<transcript>: Aws does not hit the wallet hard.

14:02:10
<transcript>: Not any harder than Versaille. I probably promise you. Now you don't have the dx of Versaille.

14:02:16
thdxr: AWS will always be the cheapest, everyone is built on top of AWS so they can't be cheaper

14:02:18
<transcript>: But all these vendors are charging a markup on top, right. Like, aws is cheaper than those things.

14:02:21
<transcript>: You hear about.

14:02:23
glamshatterskull: sometimes i'll spin up a linode vm when all i need is a quickie

14:02:26
<transcript>: People making mistakes on aws. And that costing a lot of money. Sure.

14:02:31
<transcript>: But that's a different thing than like using aws is really expensive.

14:02:37
<transcript>: do i have a fancy

14:02:37
typosrry: I use GCP and it's good enough for me, but it's better to use SQL database from elsewhere because it costs $$$

14:02:53
thdxr: Do you own a fancy japanese toilet?

14:03:31
laytanl_: Lol ever seen rds pricing?

14:03:32
vapor__dev: even companies that came out before amazon built on aws

14:03:35
statsndata: Kysely won?

14:03:36
laytanl_: No way that's cheapest

14:03:39
theloniousbird: Not a dinosaur I just couldn't find a better name lol

14:15:32
trivenge: i wonder if you can get fossabot to link your various social media channels and links when someone mentions said platforms, but only does it once in a period of time to prevent spam

14:15:42
trivenge: that way we dont need to type !podcast and so forth

14:15:43
thdxr: adam what were you saying about being a frontend aws hero

14:27:27
morocodes: feynriWave

14:27:52
neochromer: Yeah the food is good, however, the sweets are next level

14:27:53
daglee: @thdxr I used to eat a kebab pizza every friday. It was like 2500 kcal and I didn't have to eat for 24 hours. It was awesome.

14:28:01
thdxr: you can leave it empty this is a stupid CDK thing

14:28:12
thdxr: empty array

14:28:25
thdxr: it's an instance and not a cluster?

14:29:02
morocodes: God forbid you use a lookup too, that's a sacred thing that you can't just use for anything 🤡

14:29:10
jfaux: Same, I use Dynamodb for everything

14:29:12
fryday444: I love dynamo.

14:29:13
jfaux: Why is it weird?

14:29:14
techsavvytravvy: hey i use dynamodb!

14:29:20
thdxr: a lookup might be a good option here

14:29:20
mecoupz: @thdxr as a turkish man living in austria, i can confirm. turkish and austrian food is pretty good (except pork meat for me of course)

14:29:22
techsavvytravvy: Party100

14:29:22
thdxr: if it's supported

14:29:32
thdxr: oh man I love turkish food too

14:29:34
thdxr: I'm so hungry rn

14:30:24
m2devdotnet: I like parts of Dynamo but a lot of things I don’t understand

14:30:24
techsavvytravvy: same no worries, finding out as an adult it's like "what do i do with this information" lol

14:30:35
fryday444: My new dynamo use-case is keeping users in-sync between two separate but loosely related applications.

14:30:37
morocodes: @thdxr need to educate this mans on lookups

14:30:38
thdxr: oh if you guys like dynamo do you guys know alex debrie? he's trying to learn dynamo right now

14:30:43
techsavvytravvy: realational

14:30:47
mecoupz: in 2013 i was in ny with my wife and we loved that every hot dog was halal so i could eat it 👍

14:30:51

14:30:58
barely_usable: i love how that keyboard sounds

14:31:05
thdxr: if one person falls for it I'll be happy

14:31:10
morocodes: Honestly if there was a truly serverless relational db on AWS, I'd use it. DynamoDB works amazingly otherwise

14:31:42
thdxr: lookups don't exist for clusters

14:31:45
thdxr: they might exist for instances

14:31:47
thdxr: idk though CDK SUCKS!

14:31:48
morocodes: ^

14:32:04
mecoupz: alright people i have to go. have fun

14:32:21
magerdev: The latest version of Aurora is truly serverless is it not?

14:32:30
thdxr: when is statmuse gonna move to dynamo

14:32:36
morocodes: Planetscale and hopefully neon whenever that fully launches

14:32:39
magerdev: Aurora v1 wasnt but they dropped v2 like 6 months ago I think

14:32:40
thdxr: no lookups are a CDK thing

14:32:45
thdxr: once we support terraform this won't be a thing anymore

14:32:52
thdxr: yeah I'll explain why when we get on a call

14:32:53
lucca_rodrigues: What's a "truly" serverless database anyways?

14:33:06
blakegreendev: @MagerDev it doesn't scale to zero

14:33:14
fragaverage: RIP

14:33:17
thdxr: wait wait

14:33:21
kodder: Morning

14:33:25
thdxr: convince them to move to dynamo then hire me as a consultant

14:33:25
levidayne: Neon is open beta

14:33:28
thdxr: and we can hire alex as an intern

14:33:32
m2devdotnet: How do you do queries with sorts in ddb? Do you have to use a secondary index?

14:33:46
morocodes: CDK is very precious about adding lookups for new resources for some stupid reason. I was just being mad

14:33:54
morocodes: Ye, neon is open beta!

14:34:12
thdxr: this is an extremely stupid CDK thing you are going to be mindblown when I explain it to you

14:34:15
magerdev: @blakegreendev I thought dynamoDB didn't either? if you have zero activity you still pay like $1.50 for a dynamo table I understood

14:35:01
thdxr: looks like it's not

14:36:02
thdxr: the problem is postgres doesn't have a vitesse equivalent (they sorta used to with Citus) so Neon has more work ahead of them than Planetscale

14:36:12
thdxr: which is why I switched over to mysql

14:36:21
thdxr: plus Sam Lambert and Aaron Francis are cool people

14:36:34
m2devdotnet: Thanks. Been working on a server less photo gallery in DDB

14:36:48
thdxr: adam what is your arm doing.....

14:36:59
magerdev: im a dynamoDB fan boy all day

14:37:03
morocodes: Tbf, I have the same question about MySQL 😉

14:37:04
thdxr: I hope you were scratching your leg

14:37:11
morocodes: Why can't we all just use Postgres xD

14:37:15
magerdev: spending $1 for my DB is always a satisfying feeling

14:37:19
thdxr: it cut to the overhead shot and your arm was under the table going back and forth....

14:37:30
andreaslorozco: LOL

thdxr: the drawstring I mean
