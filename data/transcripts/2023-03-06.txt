00:12:31
<transcript>: I'm back at Sam Use. It is still like a contract relationship.

00:12:31

<transcript>: There's only like four of us. There's four engineers. And then there's like four non engineers.

00:13:24
<transcript>: So it doesn't feel any different. Feels like I came back to the team that the people who are still here are people that were there when I left.

00:13:27
<transcript>: Just hopping right back in.

00:15:13
lilfreezi: 2015 was 17 years ago. something to think about.

00:15:21
<transcript>: Wow. It feels so good to be back on twitch. I love twitch. I have my breakfast with me this morning. I would have started streaming an hour ago. Not that anyone cares, but I would have.

00:15:23
<transcript>: Except.

00:15:27
fragaverage: I CARE

00:15:30

<transcript>: Frag.

00:15:32
<transcript>: so

00:15:33
<transcript>: So I didn't.

00:15:33
<transcript>: i didn't

00:15:47
<transcript>: I didn't start streaming my process of trying to get my overlays to work. I never did get them working. Follow notifications. I can't subscribe to follow web hooks. I'm gonna rip it all out and not do the webhook thing. I'll do the whatever the other thing is websockets or something.

00:15:54
cowfacedude99: a

00:16:14
fossabot: Adam spends some time on Twitter but kinda hates it: https://twitter.com/aeduhm

00:16:17
trivenge: !youtube

00:16:18
<transcript>: Oh, I do get subscriber notifications. Alex, thanks so much for the sub. I did not expect to get any webhook events.

00:16:21
<transcript>: I might want to refund. Oh, that was coffee. I'm sorry.

00:16:25
fragaverage: Because they follow to get a notif' when you go live

00:16:27
<transcript>: Like I can read through. There's people following me. I've not streamed.

00:16:27
<transcript>: for

cowfacedude99: Are you still waiting on packer or moving to lazy nvim?

<transcript>: For months. People, months? Why are there people following me for the last week.

00:16:35
<transcript>: Ha.

<transcript>: Adam since time sometime on Twitter, but kind of hate it.

00:16:50
daneoshiga: twitch suggestions too

schrew: also hi!!

00:16:58
<transcript>: That's funny 2015 was 17 years ago no wasn't you lie. That is not true.

00:16:58
<transcript>: something to

00:17:00
<transcript>: Something to think about.

00:17:02
<transcript>: I'm quite giggly.

00:17:08
<transcript>: You still with packer, or moving to lazy envym.

00:17:15
<transcript>: What is lazy in them? I still use Packer. Am I waiting for Packer is packerslow. I didn't even notice.

00:17:19
docmos: idk I heard you on some podcasts 2 weeks ago and decided to follow lol

00:17:25
<transcript>: Doc modes. Thank you so much for the subscribe. The Prime subscribe. Subscription. Sub. Prime sub. That's the word. That's it.

00:17:25
<transcript>: it's been a while

00:17:31
<transcript>: It's been a while. I'm rusty people. I never really got the hang of twitch. And then I just left for months.

00:17:31
<transcript>: first time

00:17:37
<transcript>: First time chat. Two. Welcome to Chatmost. I don't know. I heard you on some podcast two weeks ago and decided to follow.

00:17:37
<transcript>: that's awesome

00:17:39
<transcript>: That's awesome. I appreciate it.

00:17:39
<transcript>: were they

00:17:44
<transcript>: Were they the tomorrow fmp? I need a plug for tomorrow FM.

00:17:45
adamdotdev: tomorrow.fm

00:17:45
<transcript>: fmr

00:17:46
<transcript>: fmrl fm

00:17:49
<transcript>: Fmrl FM was it that podcast? I just thought I'd dropped the link.

00:17:50
zirus16: im seeing statmuse for first time, look cool, where is the dark mode? my eyesss!! im kidding, good luck with Astro.

00:17:51
<transcript>: Inconspicuously.

00:18:11
<transcript>: Seeing status your first time looks cool. Where is the Dark mode? My eyes. I'm kidding. Good luck with that show. That's funny, zares, because my cofounder wants to add Dark mode and at first I was like, I don't know, the developer is used statmes. Like, I feel like Dartmode is a developer thing, but it's not just developing. Everyone cares about their eyes.

00:18:11
<transcript>: not just

00:18:15
<transcript>: Not just developers, even people who like sports.

00:18:15
<transcript>: so yeah

00:18:15
trivenge: nah its not just developer

00:18:17
<transcript>: So, yeah, we're gonna add Dartmouth.

00:18:22
<transcript>: Not just developers.

00:18:22
<transcript>: it

00:18:31
<transcript>: It's just kind of like a cliche with developers, you know, like that. We want Dark mode, like you can't make a dev tool without. I think you just default the Dartmode if it's dev tool, right.

00:18:39
<transcript>: I guess everybody cares about their eyes. And it's better. Right? Where is it? I think some people it's better to have light modes. So then you have to have the toggle.

00:18:42
<transcript>: Okay.

00:18:50
cowfacedude99: folke came up with this December and it blew up. I don't use it because I use nix but since you don't https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim

00:18:50
docmos: Yeah that's what it was. Was surfing the Internet for serversless and self-employed ressources

00:18:51

00:18:52
<transcript>: But.

00:18:55
trivenge: sounds good

00:18:57
<transcript>: It's gonna be a good time. It's gonna be good just seeing you all again.

<transcript>: How did I do that.

00:19:47
<transcript>: so much of

00:19:53
<transcript>: So much of my experience with new of them has been centered around packer installing all of my stuff.

00:19:54
thdxr: Adam distracted me and I accidentally used the women's barbell

00:19:55
<transcript>: But this is better.

<transcript>: I don't know what this song is.

00:21:46
<transcript>: I don't know.

00:21:49
thdxr: don't use harpoon prime will steal your data

00:21:51
<transcript>: Okay. I don't hate it.

00:21:54
<transcript>: I've never seen this.

00:21:54
<transcript>: that's awesome

00:21:54
alexkates: Nah philly. It's like miami but way colder and way more depressing

00:21:57
<transcript>: That's awesome. Okay, installation.

00:22:00
<transcript>: So what do I do.

00:22:00
<transcript>: i'm gonna have to

00:22:03
<transcript>: I'm gonna have to open my dot files. Is that a dangerous.

00:22:05
<transcript>: That's dangerous. But.

00:22:11
<transcript>: We're gonna do it.

00:22:22
<transcript>: This happened. Join us in following oh, yeah, yeah? Shout out yes. Shout out DAX also streams on Twitch.

00:22:26
<transcript>: What CD.

00:22:28
trivenge: @thdxr  LUL

00:22:29
<transcript>: Actually have my.

00:22:44
<transcript>: Twitch set up on the screen. Now, since I have this little section where my face is, I can put stuff there that doesn't show up for you all. And I just put a twitchat right there and it's got this weird little popup that shoutout did. It's kind of cool, though.

00:22:44
<transcript>: but when i

00:22:48
<transcript>: But when I expand it, the options are unfollow or dismiss.

00:22:48
<transcript>: we'll just dismiss

00:22:49
<transcript>: We'll just dismiss.

00:22:49
<transcript>: you

00:22:52
<transcript>: You better watch it. I'm just kidding.

00:22:55
<transcript>: And then.

00:23:06
<transcript>: Okay, what am I doing? I'm going into my Neil Them configuration because it wouldn't be me streaming on twitch if I weren't messing with my Nielvim configuration.

00:23:08
<transcript>: I'm not looking for.

00:23:14
cowfacedude99: guess twitch changed the commands.

00:23:16
<transcript>: This is why I don't want to abandon Packer is I have all this weird stuff that like autoinstall stuff whenever I save this file which I guess is kind of stupid.

00:23:18
<transcript>: A little mattical.

00:23:18
<transcript>: okay

00:23:20
<transcript>: Okay, we're gonna add.

00:23:24
<transcript>: Hey, Leighton.

00:23:29
<transcript>: We're gonna add.

00:23:37
<transcript>: Whatever we're gonna add harpoon. I don't know why I'm putting a label. It's gonna save harpoon. Right here. Right.

00:23:37
<transcript>: that was cool

00:23:40
<transcript>: That was cool. That was that github, Go, pilot.

00:23:41
thdxr: Adams statmuse productivity is gonna plummet

00:23:43
<transcript>: Look at that.

00:23:46
<transcript>: Okay.

00:23:56
<transcript>: Let's see if I can remember how to use this. I used to use this thing.

00:23:59
thdxr: back to spending 50% of time in nvim config

00:24:05
<transcript>: I used to use this thing. Can I just do this? Yeah. The Prime.

00:24:07
<transcript>: Heart.

00:24:12
<transcript>: Pin, no, no matches. Okay.

00:24:14
<transcript>: Pull.

00:24:14
<transcript>: yes

00:24:16
<transcript>: Yes.

00:24:17
<transcript>: So close.

00:24:23
<transcript>: The yes, yes. Now what? Now how do I keep going.

00:24:24
<transcript>: The Prime.

00:24:29
<transcript>: And then I could have just Typed it. Yep. Could have just Typed it.

00:24:29
jammontoast: @thdxr That is what scares me about nvim. LUL

00:24:34
<transcript>: Let's see how do I go back to.

00:24:38
<transcript>: I'm just gonna type it. That's what I'm gonna do.

00:24:41
cowfacedude99: new view LUL

00:24:45
<transcript>: The prime. Look at that copilot. Now, if I save it, it should just install it.

00:24:45
<transcript>: i have

00:24:46
thdxr: what the hell is this view

00:24:47
trivenge: i hear most people spend their time in neovim configs if they dont use vscode. i read that on reddit SeemsGood

00:24:50
<transcript>: I have to configure it probably that's how these things work.

00:24:51
<transcript>: Oh.

00:24:54
<transcript>: Failed.

00:25:00
<transcript>: Oh, no, I haven't done this in so long. What am I doing? Why am I updating the of him? No, no. Undo.

00:25:03
thdxr: don't trust neovim haters

00:25:03
<transcript>: Oh no.

00:25:06
<transcript>: What have I done.

00:25:06
<transcript>: it has been

00:25:08
thdxr: they're just jealous

00:25:11
<transcript>: It has been a long time since I've updated Neil them. It is not going to work anymore.

00:25:15
<transcript>: Okay. Cool. Well.

00:25:17
<transcript>: That's the thing.

00:25:22
<transcript>: Maybe single just work.

00:25:24
<transcript>: I.

00:25:33
<transcript>: 'm Used Productivity is gonna plummet, Yeah.

00:25:35
okufa_f: vim configs tend to take quite a while yeah

00:25:37
<transcript>: Yeah, we'll see how this goes. I'm only streaming, like.

00:25:37
<transcript>: less than

00:25:40
<transcript>: Less than half of my day so that'll help.

00:25:40
cowfacedude99: @triveNge Once you get to a point you don't touch it at all.

00:25:45
nunesgamingspace: What is your setup??

00:25:45
<transcript>: But I don't imagine I'll get quite as much done.

00:25:48
<transcript>: While streaming, let's just how it works.

00:25:48
<transcript>: nunes

00:25:51
<transcript>: Nunes. Welcome to Chat. What is your setup.

00:25:56
schrew: Adam's out here telling on himself that he isn't a born again neovim user unless he's streaming

00:25:56
<transcript>: Utah, me. Or maybe you're trying to calf.

00:25:57
trivenge: i am learning atm, so im sticking with vs code just because, well, its easy,m though i have spent a lot of time configuring it already. i would be in configs elsewhere as well LUL

00:26:02
trivenge: @cowfacedude99  yeah i was just making a joke lol

00:26:02
thdxr: his setup is a Windows XP machine

00:26:06
<transcript>: True.

00:26:06
<transcript>: no

00:26:09
<transcript>: No I use new of him regardless of streaming.

00:26:11
<transcript>: I just haven't updated my.

00:26:11
<transcript>: configure

00:26:14
<transcript>: Configure. I haven't needed to I haven't been streaming.

00:26:18
<transcript>: I only mess with the new my new of him conveyed when I'm streaming.

00:26:22
nunesgamingspace: Like u on Linux or Mac ?

00:26:23
<transcript>: Also true good to see you.

00:26:27
cowfacedude99: can't remember the last time I touched mine.

00:26:28
thdxr: windows xp

00:26:36
<transcript>: What is what view? Dax, I just saw your comment. What's wrong with this view? Is there something wrong with seeing my face? All that code.

00:26:38
<transcript>: In my body.

00:26:38
<transcript>: most of my

00:26:41
<transcript>: Most of my body. Is there something wrong with that.

00:26:41
<transcript>: are you body sh

00:26:42
fragaverage: closet vscoder for sure

00:26:43
<transcript>: Are you body shaming me.

00:26:46
thdxr: we saw a different view from behind your computer

00:26:46
<transcript>: Oh, wait. Did do the thing. Did it switch to the.

00:26:46
<transcript>: switch

00:26:51
<transcript>: Switch to the like the view of me with my yeah, the different view? Yeah? I've got a.

00:26:59
<transcript>: I set up another camera. I just haven't do that every five minutes. Just gonna, like, show that view. It's not the most artistic way to do it.

00:26:59
<transcript>: but i

00:27:00
thdxr: sneaky view

00:27:06
<transcript>: But I want to mix it up, you know, like, I'm working on something. I'm working so hard. And then you just, like, see me in context, at my desk.

00:27:06
cowfacedude99: it switched to the one from behind the monitor

00:27:09
<transcript>: Sneaky view.

00:27:17
okufa_f: ungodly coding hours. im on west coast

00:27:17
<transcript>: Okay. What do I need to do to configure harpoon? I guess I need to read the docs or something.

00:27:19
daneoshiga: you were confused and the view changed to confuse us too

00:27:22
<transcript>: I can't believe I'm starting with Neil Them configuration.

00:27:27
<transcript>: Yeah. I was confused.

00:27:30
<transcript>: It matched the confusion on my face.

00:27:38
<transcript>: Frag closet via scotter. Stop it.

00:27:38
<transcript>: stop it

00:27:39
<transcript>: Stop it.

00:27:39
<transcript>: tmucks how

00:27:41
sockthedev: you need to use lazy.nvim too adam. so good.

00:27:42
<transcript>: Tmucks. How does this work with Timo.

00:27:47
<transcript>: Switching term with team.

00:27:47
<transcript>: i don't understand

00:27:49
tayloreddev: wouldn't be a software dev twitch stream without a bit of neovim LUL

00:27:50
<transcript>: I don't understand what a harpoon does. I thought I understood, but I don't understand.

00:27:59
<transcript>: You Mark files. That's what I understood. You say, like, I want this file.

00:28:01
<transcript>: These Three files.

00:28:04
<transcript>: View All Project marks.

00:28:04
<transcript>: was that

00:28:06
<transcript>: Was that okay.

00:28:08
<transcript>: I could see how this is really useful.

00:28:19
<transcript>: And it saves within a project like you store hartland configuration per project. That's cool. So when I come back, it'll just already have those files like that.

00:28:33
<transcript>: Sock. How you doing, sock? You need to use lazy mvm two. That's what cafes just said. Everyone says late lazy envym is better now. It's better than Packer.

00:28:33
<transcript>: okay

00:28:34
<transcript>: Okay.

00:28:40
thdxr: oh good news it wasn't a womans barbell I'm just strong af

00:28:47
<transcript>: Okay. I should actually just work. Let's just work because it's a short stream. I can't spend my whole time doing the new event thing. Cathy's, I promise this week I will set apart pin, you will have me as a harpoon man. So this is stat muse.

00:28:47
<transcript>: com

00:28:48
<transcript>: Com.

00:28:48
<transcript>: here sammy

00:28:54
mhuggins7278: Yeah and. Then I bind ctrl-j,k,l,; to the first 4 files in harpoon for easy swapping

00:28:55
<transcript>: Here, sammy's Calm. And this is shaquillo neil's Page on Statmeat. Calm. Oh, video Ad. Look at this.

00:28:59
<transcript>: Hadn't seen that yet. About that.

00:28:59
<transcript>: oh

00:29:02
<transcript>: Oh, it's gonna do that. Oh, I don't like that.

00:29:10
<transcript>: Okay, so this is Samus.com. I'm rebuilding it in astro. This is a react app that we prerender.

00:29:14
trivenge: boycott statmuse because of ads LUL

00:29:18
<transcript>: What's like a elixir Phoenix app with a React front end. So this table is like this is all React, but like our site.

00:29:18
<transcript>: is mostly

00:29:22
cowfacedude99: about the time you get an adblocker LUL

00:29:34
<transcript>: Is mostly just like getting traffic from Google. In fact, we get like 5000 new inbound organic people from Google every single day. So Sam use as it exists, is just a huge giant millions of pages seo magnet thing. I'll look at this camera now.

00:29:34
<transcript>: that

00:29:38
<transcript>: That's what Sam use is and it should not be a react app.

00:29:38
<transcript>: there's very little

00:29:40
noctumsempra: jaajjaja

00:29:43
noctumsempra: heey long time no see

00:29:46
<transcript>: There's very little interactivity. It's mostly tons of pages of facts. Well, I guess I should show what that means is. So you can actually.

00:29:46
<transcript>: just

00:29:53
<transcript>: Just ask questions like in normal language and get answers about sports questions. That's what Sam use is.

00:29:53
<transcript>: that's what it started

00:29:59
<transcript>: That's what it started as. But it's turned into this sprawling sports reference.

00:29:59
<transcript>: it's a

00:30:05
<transcript>: It's a wealth of knowledge. What camera? I don't know what camera to look at. Which one? That one.

00:30:07
<transcript>: No. Okay. Here.

00:30:09
lilfreezi: where does statmuse get its data

00:30:12
<transcript>: Yes, we do really well on Google. So if you search like.

00:30:12
<transcript>: most

00:30:13
<transcript>: Most.

00:30:13
<transcript>: saxop clear

00:30:18
<transcript>: Saxop. Clearly. I've searched some stats. Questions. Just search like a stat question.

00:30:18
<transcript>: and stat

00:30:25
<transcript>: And status is probably the top or the top two or three results. Right. So I just.

00:30:25
<transcript>: act in the game

00:30:26
trivenge: what about bing?

00:30:28
<transcript>: Act in the game what if I said by player.

00:30:34
<transcript>: Like we have all these long tail pages that answer specific sports questions.

00:30:36
<transcript>: And.

00:30:36
<transcript>: those shouldn't

00:30:43
<transcript>: Those shouldn't be a react app. Those should be something that's just really fast. And so I'm rewriting it all on Astro.

00:30:43
<transcript>: okay now

00:30:46
<transcript>: Okay. Now I'm gonna catch up on chat.

00:30:46
<transcript>: del

00:30:54
<transcript>: Del Wood. Seven months. Look what the cat dragged in. Welcome, though. Voye. I'm also sorry about those seven months not being.

00:30:54
<transcript>: entirely

00:30:56
<transcript>: Entirely filled with streaming.

00:30:58
<transcript>: Only partially.

00:30:59
alexkates: Curious, why not SSG and Next?

00:31:01
<transcript>: It wasn't a woman's barbell. You're just strong. Okay.

00:31:09
<transcript>: Taylor's here. Hey, Taylor. I'm sorry if I missed anybody. I'm not reading chat. Very well. I should stay on top of it.

00:31:12
<transcript>: A long time don't see knocked them.

00:31:13
<transcript>: Welcome back.

00:31:13
<transcript>: or i guess

00:31:19
<transcript>: Or I guess welcome back to me boycott Stamp because of the ads. That's funny.

00:31:21
<transcript>: Where does that music.

00:31:24
<transcript>: Great question. A little freezie.

00:31:24
<transcript>: the answer

00:31:25
<transcript>: The answer is.

00:31:25
<transcript>: and alex i'll get

00:31:28
noctumsempra: Double WB haha

00:31:30
<transcript>: And Alex, I'll get to your question, too. The answer is. So we started.

00:31:30
<transcript>: eight years ago

00:31:31
thdxr: because react is over

00:31:35
<transcript>: Eight years ago, I scraped mba.com and I got a bunch of data. And that was how we started.

00:31:35
<transcript>: then we hired

00:31:40
<transcript>: Then we hired like one of the world's renowned sports Set edition.

00:31:40
<transcript>: his name is

00:31:45
thdxr: we explore this more in our upcoming podcast

00:31:47
<transcript>: His name is Justin Capacco. He created Basketball Reference. And he was there for something like four or five years, maybe six years.

00:31:55
lilfreezi: bball ref is a great site

00:31:56
<transcript>: And he was our like, lead set asition and he is literally he has this database of sports data, which we now.

00:31:56
<transcript>: license

00:31:58
<transcript>: License in perpetuity.

00:32:05
trivenge: was the goal initially to make money on sports betting?

00:32:16
<transcript>: But he like, took old newspapers from, like, the digitized them like, he's somebody who has contacts all over the leagues. And like, a team will be like, hey, we just found this old media guide for 1972. You want to take a peek? And he's like, yes, I do. I need puts that data into his like, he's got this crazy.

00:32:20
<transcript>: Accurate for North American Sports. This crazy.

00:32:20
<transcript>: comprehensive

00:32:24
<transcript>: Comprehensive Sports Database and that's what status is powered by.

00:32:28
<transcript>: Be barf is a great side. There you go. We have same data that Be borf has.

00:32:35
<transcript>: So Alex asked why not SSG? And next so SSG.

00:32:35
<transcript>: first of all

00:32:39
<transcript>: First of all is not good because we have.

00:32:40
<transcript>: I don't know.

00:32:40
<transcript>: ten

00:32:47
alexkates: oh boy can't wait for that dax

00:32:54
<transcript>: Tens of billions of pages. I don't even know if there's a like a number. It's a lot. We have lots and lots and lots of pages. So we definitely don't do SSG where we build ahead of time. You could say, Well, why not next with ISR.

00:33:03
<transcript>: And the answer is I just don't I don't want to use React on stat muse. I just don't think we need 200 uncopressed JS.

00:33:03
<transcript>: for sort

00:33:14
trivenge: i would rather have better performance

00:33:22
<transcript>: For sorting columns like that's. Basically, the only interactivity on the site is like, oh, I want to sort that column. I think we can do that without the React runtime. And that's the thing. I'm not like, I'm kind of down on React, but mostly because I'm working on statues, and it's just not a good fit. It's not a spa. It's just this huge collection of pages.

00:33:22
<transcript>: and

00:33:36
<transcript>: And I think it makes more sense to use something that's kind of like catered toward that, right? So I could have done like I could have done next year. I just I don't feel like it makes sense to load them as javascript for what this page is or for what the site is.

00:33:43
<transcript>: Because react is over that's the other answer.

00:33:43
<transcript>: we've done

00:33:44
alexkates: makes sense! where is statemuse hosted?

00:33:44
<transcript>: We've done.

00:33:44
<transcript>: an upcoming

00:33:46
<transcript>: An upcoming podcast.

00:33:49
<transcript>: Was the goal initially to make money on sports betting.

00:33:49
<transcript>: so

00:33:52
<transcript>: So no.

00:33:56
<transcript>: Sports betting wasn't legal back in 2014 when we started it in the us.

00:33:56
<transcript>: so we're making

00:33:58
trivenge: !podcast

00:34:10
<transcript>: So we're making this mostly for US sports fans. It's all the US sports. And the legalization effort didn't happen until, like three, four years into Sat muse's lifecycle. And they made even still or lifetime.

00:34:10
<transcript>: it's still

00:34:14
<transcript>: It's still not legal in every state. So that wasn't the initial.

00:34:14
<transcript>: idea

00:34:15
<transcript>: Idea.

00:34:15
<transcript>: the idea was

00:34:22
<transcript>: The idea was just like sports fans, but it ended up being, yes, journalists, sports, better fantasy players.

00:34:22
<transcript>: those are the people

00:34:37
<transcript>: Those are the people in sports better is probably are the biggest like driver of staff music usage. We got like 2 million searches a day now on Statmen.com. I think we went like three years before we had like a million searches total. So it's kind of crazy how much over eight years it's grown.

00:34:42
<transcript>: But it's yeah, it is a lot of sports better. They use that news for.

00:34:45
<transcript>: Their bedding.

00:34:45
<transcript>: making informed

00:34:47
<transcript>: Making informed decisions.

00:34:54
<transcript>: I would rather have better performance. Me too. Makes sense. Where is that? News hosted. So it is on AWS.

00:34:59
<transcript>: Oh, we need to add a podcast command grid, call revenge.

00:34:59
<transcript>: can i just call

00:35:07
<transcript>: Can I just call you try. I realize, like we've talked quite a bit on discord. I've never had to say your name out loud because I was streaming.

00:35:07
<transcript>: so i don't have

00:35:08
caasidev: hello there :-)

00:35:13
<transcript>: So I don't have, like, a short name for you. I'm gonna say I'm gonna say trive. Cassie's. Here. What's up? Cassie.

00:35:19
<transcript>: I was about to answer a question.

00:35:20
okufa_f: i saw a tweet earlier saying youre done with react. why is that?

00:35:21
<transcript>: Aws.

00:35:24
<transcript>: This hosted on AWS.

00:35:29
<transcript>: So it's the Curve version of sammy's. Com. What you're seeing here is like an elixir Phoenix app.

00:35:32
<transcript>: This will be.

00:35:32
<transcript>: ast

00:35:37
<transcript>: Astro and so far I haven't built like the column sorting.

00:35:37
<transcript>: but

00:35:39
<transcript>: But.

00:35:40
thdxr: why AWS and not vercel?

00:35:52
<transcript>: I was gonna use well, so I was gonna use solid js for all the client side, reactivity stuff or interactivity. I just I'm starting to think I'm just gonna use vanilla js because I just don't even think there's a reason to use anything else.

00:35:52
<transcript>: i guess

00:36:04
tayloreddev: i've been listening to the podcast today. Great content from yourself and Dax SeemsGood

00:36:07
alexkates: Building my latest side project on vercel and i can't go back

00:36:10
<transcript>: I guess, literally just the sorting. The column sorting. These are all separate pages, which in the status app today they're not separate pages. This is the react part. It's like, oh, it's a spa. Loading all these tables, but nah, nah, nah. I said, nah, those are just separate pages.

00:36:14
trivenge: dont matter tbh. most just call me triv tbh (triv like trivium the band or trivium the comprised derivation of grammar, logic, and rhetoric)

00:36:17
<transcript>: Why aws, and not verselle dax? Is that just a softball.

00:36:17
<transcript>: is that just

00:36:18
thdxr: wait...podcast?? you were recording me????

00:36:20
<transcript>: Is that just you just toss them that one up for me.

00:36:25
<transcript>: Because verselle would be very expensive for Sammys.com, I believe.

00:36:25
<transcript>: we do

00:36:26
maleero: @thdxr He‚Äôs going to use SST. Duh bro

00:36:28
<transcript>: We do a lot a lot of traffic.

00:36:36
th3_l3m0n: Hello o/ nice to see you streaming again!

00:36:39
okufa_f: and aws isnt expensive?

00:36:40
<transcript>: I've been listening to the podcast today. Great content from yourself. And next. Thank you so much, Taylor. I appreciate that. We're really enjoying it. We've got several episodes we've recorded. They haven't even been released yet.

00:36:40
<transcript>: there must be i

00:36:44
<transcript>: There must be. I don't know. We're supposed to release on Monday's. Decks. I don't know if we have one edited.

00:37:04
<transcript>: You were recording me. That's awesome. That's the Gold axe is to get to a point where it's just, like, literally just conversation. I still feel like I'm kind of like trying to be on a podcast or something like I'm trying to sound like a modified guess. I wanted to get to where it's just literally, like, record. And this is a conversation we would have had.

00:37:04
<transcript>: anyway

00:37:10
<transcript>: Anyway, you probably are that way because you're cool. But like I'm still I'm still kind of not there yet.

00:37:25
<transcript>: No. Versailles. Great. Alex, don't. Nothing I said here should imply that versailles not great. The next js isn't great. They're great options. I built lots of things on them. They're great. Just for statues. I don't think it's a good fit.

00:37:29
<transcript>: Don't matter.

00:37:29
<transcript>: did most just

00:37:33
<transcript>: Did most just call me triv. Oh, triv, that makes sense. Yeah.

00:37:36
<transcript>: We'll go with Triv.

00:37:42
trivenge: before i get to this meeting here, has any of the stuff we discussed helped at all? just give me a thumbsup or down if so SeemsGood  i gotta jet here. just got a phone call so setting up my mic etc lol

00:37:42
<transcript>: I am using SSD. So the new statmes is SSD.

00:37:48
<transcript>: And I need to change a bunch of stuff now that I've seen dax build in SST project.

00:37:53
<transcript>: I need to change lots of things because I did things wrong.

00:37:56
<transcript>: Very idiotic. Sst.

00:38:00
thdxr: SST's pricing model is per request

00:38:04
<transcript>: Oh, yeah? So everything me and dax are doing? Me and Backs are working on rebase TV.

00:38:04
<transcript>: re

00:38:10
thdxr: jk to anyone reading that

00:38:12
alexkates: so hype on rebase

00:38:14
thdxr: it's free!

00:38:15
trivenge: rebase.tv POGGERS

00:38:18
<transcript>: Rebase TV. It's gonna be a live game show for devs, where you can win real game, wilk, real cash prizes. I can't say it. I couldn't say it on the podcast. I can't say it here. I want to, like, just give the speed, and I stumble over it every time.

00:38:27
<transcript>: Isn't AWS expensive. No, I mean.

00:38:27
<transcript>: aws

00:38:32
<transcript>: Aws can be expensive. You don't know what you're doing or if you make a mistake, but.

00:38:32
<transcript>: versaille is

00:38:37
thdxr: you can't get cheaper than aws

00:38:40
<transcript>: Versaille is I don't know, thousands of percent more expenses because they Mark up everything. So it's cheaper than Versaille.

00:38:40
<transcript>: and the limit

00:38:41
<transcript>: And the limit.

00:38:41
<transcript>: nice to see

00:38:43
<transcript>: Nice to see you in my chat again.

00:38:48
fragaverage: I don't believe that is true

00:38:50
<transcript>: Any of the stuff we discuss helped at all, just gave me a thumbs up. Yes, triv, Yes.

00:39:08
<transcript>: Everything you've discussed. I know so much more about you tube. Now I just haven't made more videos. I've filmed several videos. I'll talk to you about it on discord. I filmed several can't pull the trigger. On editing them kind of decides they're all garbage. And there we are. It's been a while since I've released a YouTube video.

00:39:13
trivenge: no worries, i would rather you post video than not SeemsGood

00:39:14
grasp5533: Hello

00:39:15
<transcript>: Can't get to NA bs. That's right.

00:39:17
trivenge: i gotta jet though

00:39:20
trivenge: be back in a bit

00:39:22
<transcript>: Frag doesn't believe it doesn't agree, though. There's also people on Twitter that don't agree with that. They've told me.

00:39:22
<transcript>: very vocal

00:39:24
<transcript>: Very vocal.

00:39:31
<transcript>: See a Triv.

00:39:31
<transcript>: gra

00:39:36
fragaverage: Not to dax's comment LUL definitely wont get cheaper than the actual service provider lol

00:39:37
<transcript>: Grasp is here. Hello, grasp peeking over my I'm supposed to just like be working intently when this view pops up.

00:39:37
<transcript>: like

00:39:39
<transcript>: Like looking at my screen.

00:39:39
<transcript>: but

00:39:44
<transcript>: But I keep seeing it pop up, and I'm like, hey there, over there.

00:39:48
okufa_f: would you ever use react again on a non statmuse project?

00:39:56
<transcript>: Not to dax's comment definitely won't get cheaper than the actual service. Oh, okay. You were saying don't believe something else is true. Okay, so, yeah. Rebase, We're, me and dax, we're working on this. It's cool. You can sign up.

00:39:56
<transcript>: you get a ticket

00:39:59
<transcript>: You get a ticket and you can share that with people.

00:39:59
<transcript>: and

00:40:07
cazcik: can't get cheaper than bare metal LUL

00:40:12
<transcript>: And maybe win them in M. Two macbook Pro. Just saying you should probably do it. Rebase TV. We're gonna be it'll probably be still several weeks. But we're gonna be launching the first show. It'll be fun.

00:40:14
alexkates: That ticket component is so well done. What did you use forat?

00:40:16
jammontoast: Feels like Home Improvement, peaking over the fence

00:40:16
<transcript>: Okay. So what I'm doing today.

00:40:16
<transcript>: well besides

00:40:18
fragaverage: Are you doing any work today? OMEGALUL

00:40:18
alexkates: for that*

00:40:20
<transcript>: Well Besides just talking and not doing anything.

00:40:20
<transcript>: what

00:40:23
<transcript>: What I'm doing is I'm working on.

00:40:26
<transcript>: Game log.

00:40:26
<transcript>: view

00:40:30
<transcript>: View so I've got all the players and team profile pages. Like if I go to these.

00:40:30
<transcript>: pages

00:40:39
<transcript>: Pages. You can click on teams. I've got all these team profile pages. Done. What? What just happens? Okay, that one was a mistake.

00:40:39
<transcript>: okay

00:40:42
<transcript>: Okay, we have problems, but.

00:40:42
<transcript>: but

00:40:47
<transcript>: But most. Oh, that's the history page that shouldn't show all that stuff when it's on history.

00:40:47
<transcript>: i'll fix that

00:40:49
<transcript>: I'll fix that.

00:40:52
<transcript>: So I've got all these pages. Done.

00:40:56
<transcript>: All these pages are done.

00:40:56
<transcript>: you can go

00:41:00
<transcript>: You can go to a player. All these pages are done.

00:41:05
<transcript>: Yep.

00:41:05
<transcript>: so

00:41:19
<transcript>: So now I just have to I've got all the team and all the player profiles. I've just got to do the game ones. So like, right here, this is a page. It's gonna take me to a game, and I have nothing on it. That's what I got to build and what it looks like.

00:41:19
<transcript>: let's see

00:41:22
<transcript>: Let's see, let's just do this.

00:41:23
okufa_f: do you want to directly compete with sports-reference

00:41:30
<transcript>: So this is what it should look like? This is what it currently looks like.

00:41:33
<transcript>: So should be this.

00:41:34
<transcript>: Currently this.

00:41:34
<transcript>: we got some work

00:41:36
<transcript>: We got some work to do.

00:41:41
<transcript>: We want to directly compete with Sports reference.

00:41:45
<transcript>: We kind of do I mean, we have been for years.

00:41:49
<transcript>: We're Sports reference, but fun.

00:41:49
<transcript>: colorful

00:41:55
<transcript>: Colorful. And we hired an artist that's worked there for eight years. And he makes all these illustrations.

00:41:55
<transcript>: so

00:41:58
<transcript>: So we're kind of like Sports reference.

00:41:58
<transcript>: but

00:42:06
<transcript>: But there is still like a huge group of people in the journalism community like sports riders, that still just use the sports reference sites.

00:42:06
<transcript>: it's hard to get

00:42:10
<transcript>: It's hard to get them to switch over to Satmese because they know how to find what they want.

00:42:10
<transcript>: stammy's

00:42:13
<transcript>: Stammy's. Is a little more geared toward.

00:42:13
<transcript>: the

00:42:16
alexkates: time to work work. catch ya tomorrow!

00:42:18
<transcript>: The younger generation, maybe people who didn't grow up on Sports reference.

00:42:18
jammontoast: Do you have any F keys binded in Neovim? Might be an issue for me, on my MBP on the move a lot, with the stupid touch pad key things.

00:42:23
schrew: Ah, vendor lock in for sports stats

00:42:27
<transcript>: I should actually read Chat. Are you doing any work today? No. Probably not. Frag.

00:42:36
<transcript>: What I ever use React again on Nonsense project? I don't know. I just said last night on Twitter that I was done. I said I was done with react.

00:42:39
<transcript>: Just how I felt, you know.

00:42:39
<transcript>: i just

00:42:42
<transcript>: I just. I the thing about react.

00:42:42
<transcript>: i just feel like if

00:42:43
okufa_f: i see statmuse screenshots on sports discords all the time

00:42:48
<transcript>: I just feel like if I'm gonna build a spa, which I don't very often I'm gonna use solid. I don't know why I would use react.

00:42:48
<transcript>: at this point

00:42:49
<transcript>: At this point.

00:42:52
fragaverage: Can you give a rough birds eye view of how a site like stat muse generates revenue?

00:42:52
<transcript>: I just don't have a reason.

00:42:52
<transcript>: that's

00:42:54
<transcript>: That's me.

00:43:00
<transcript>: Can't get cheaper than bare metal OOH don't get me started on bare metal.

00:43:01
benkelly86: Hey Adam. So you're not contracting anymore? You're back in full time job mode?

00:43:05
<transcript>: That taking upon it so well done. What did you use for it? What did we use for the ticket component.

00:43:13
<transcript>: I'm gonna give you the dumb answer HTML and css. Oh, and then the 3d effect is some some library. I don't know.

00:43:16
<transcript>: But the ticket component is.

00:43:21
<transcript>: There's just a design and figma that I turned into CSS.

00:43:21
<transcript>: and

00:43:22
grasp5533: What made you want to go from consulting to being an employee again? Sorry if it's too personal

00:43:23
<transcript>: And then.

00:43:23
<transcript>: made it respons

00:43:26
<transcript>: Made it responsive. Yeah, it's vertical, too.

00:43:26
<transcript>: and then that

00:43:29
thdxr: hey it uses SVG also!

00:43:31
<transcript>: And then that little effect where you, like, move it around. That's just some library that does that.

00:43:35
<transcript>: Look at all these people I referred. Hey, Taylor, you're in here.

00:43:43
<transcript>: What was. I was reading chat. That's what I was doing. I was not getting work done.

00:43:43
<transcript>: feel

00:43:46
<transcript>: Feels like home improvement peeking over the fence.

00:44:01
alexkates: bare metal Kreygasm

00:44:04
<transcript>: Time to work. Work. See you, Alex. Sorry. I'm like five minutes late seeing that. Do you have any F keys binded in Neil? Them. Might be an issue for me on my macbook Pro on the move. A lot with a stupid touchpad key things. I don't know what you mean. Jam.

00:44:06
<transcript>: The touchpad, Key things.

00:44:06
<transcript>: vendors

00:44:10
<transcript>: Vendors lock in for sports. That's exactly true.

00:44:11
nullchefo: Hello, so happy to see you! Why not bare metal?

00:44:19
<transcript>: You see stamping screenshots on Sports discords. All of how that's cool. That's the kind of stuff we don't have a lot of visibility into, like, we know Statinus has gotten pretty big.

00:44:22
<transcript>: And there's a lot of Twitter activities.

00:44:22
<transcript>: we get

00:44:27
<transcript>: We get a ton of traffic from Google, but we don't see things like people talking in discord.

00:44:39
jammontoast: The newer MBPs have F keys on a touchpad, rather than physical keys, that's what I was referring to

00:44:43
<transcript>: Can you give a rough bird's eye view of how sight like strap Mu generates revenue.

00:44:46
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:44:46
<transcript>: i can

00:44:47
<transcript>: I can.

00:44:49
<transcript>: So.

00:44:51
<transcript>: The side itself.

00:44:54
tayloreddev: a friend of mine operates something similar to statmuse dedicated to the world of boxing

00:44:54
<transcript>: I think the only way it generates revenue is.

00:44:57
<transcript>: These ads.

00:44:58
trivenge: do you ever post your neovim configs and so forth so people can check out what your neovim experience is like to a T? or is that not possible to experience the same neovim from computer to computer, extensions and all minus sensitive data?

00:45:00
<transcript>: So we did have some, like banner ads.

00:45:03
<transcript>: And it looks like we're doing video now.

00:45:12
<transcript>: That generates summer revenue. We also have some deals with like teams where we do.

00:45:12
<transcript>: like q

00:45:14
<transcript>: Like Q amp A, and they're.

00:45:14
<transcript>: their stadium

00:45:19
<transcript>: Their Stadium apps like if you go to a whatever.

00:45:19
<transcript>: cardinal's

00:45:29
mhuggins7278: !podcast

00:45:37
<transcript>: Cardinal's got a Lakers game. It's not I don't think the Lakers, I don't think we do this deal with the Lakers, but you go to the Lakers game and you're at the Stadium. And there's a Lakers app like for in Stadium stuff. And we do Q amp a inside some of those team apps. So that's some revenue. There's a shop.

00:45:39
<transcript>: Shop samus.com.

00:45:39
<transcript>: we have kind

00:45:40
cowfacedude99: !github

<transcript>: We have kind of a cult following within the sports and fantasy and whatever.

00:45:48
<transcript>: World so some people like our merch.

00:45:48
<transcript>: yeah

00:45:52
thdxr: adam your links are all wrong in fossabot

00:45:55
<transcript>: Yeah, but what we're doing, what I'm actually working towards is actually subscribing to sanis. So.

00:45:55
<transcript>: for people

00:45:57
<transcript>: For people who there's like.

00:45:57
<transcript>: i don't know

00:46:14
<transcript>: I don't know 300 people that do over 100 searches a month on Status. And the goal is to get some percentage of those people to pay a monthly subscription to use Status at that volume. So if you're just like showing up to the site and you want to search some stuff, it'll be free. But if you start quiz a lot, we want to capture those people.

00:46:14
<transcript>: and say hey

00:46:17
fragaverage: That's awesome :D

00:46:18
<transcript>: And say, hey, help us make this sustainable, because.

00:46:18
<transcript>: we

00:46:21
<transcript>: We raised a lot of money and.

00:46:21
<transcript>: that kept a lot time for

00:46:25
<transcript>: That kept a lot time for a long time, but now we want to grow up and make enough money.

00:46:30
cowfacedude99: @Fossabot @triveNge

00:46:33
<transcript>: Be profitable. Hey, Adam, so you're not contracting more. You're back in fulltime job mode. That's where I've been. I am back to fulltime.

00:46:41
<transcript>: Fulltime job mode working on statues what made you want to go from consulting to be an employee again? Sorry if it's your personal. No, it's not personal. All grasp.

00:46:41
<transcript>: i'm not

00:46:47
<transcript>: I'm not really. I'm technically not an employee. I'm still a contractor. So I still am kind of independent.

00:46:50
<transcript>: But a lot of it is like.

00:46:50
<transcript>: just legal

00:46:51
<transcript>: Just legal.

00:46:52
trivenge: @cowfacedude99  thanks!

00:46:56
<transcript>: Name more than anything like I am full time working on status.

00:46:56
<transcript>: and

00:46:58
<transcript>: And what made me want to do it.

00:47:01
<transcript>: So I? Tweeted something out one day.

00:47:01
<transcript>: that

00:47:06
<transcript>: That if somebody would buy Adam TV and let me stream all of my work.

00:47:06
<transcript>: i would

00:47:11
<transcript>: I would consider full time role and my cofounder reached out and here I am.

00:47:11
<transcript>: so

00:47:11
thdxr: gonna send a clip of you saying you're full time to the IRS

00:47:14
<transcript>: So Adam TV.

00:47:14
<transcript>: adam

00:47:20
<transcript>: Adam TV takes you right here because it's a very extensive redirect.

00:47:25
<transcript>: But that's where I'm live? So kind of made sense.

00:47:29
<transcript>: What uses svg.

00:47:35
<transcript>: Svg That's what uses sdg bare metal.

00:47:40
<transcript>: No Chef o's here. So happy to see you, too. Why not? Bare metal? I'll let dax into that.

00:47:40
<transcript>: dex is trying to work out

00:47:41
fragaverage: the ticket, uses svg

00:47:43
benkelly86: Do you still own shares in Statmuse?

00:47:47
<transcript>: Dex is trying to work out. The newer magma pros have F keys on a touchpad rather than physical geese. What? Oh, the function keys.

00:47:49
<transcript>: Oh.

00:48:02
<transcript>: Oh, you were asking if I used function keys? Not literally the F key. I was so confused. I was like, yeah, it's one of my home keys. That's where my index finger is the F key. But you meant like, function keys.

00:48:02
<transcript>: i gotcha

00:48:04
<transcript>: I gotcha.

00:48:19
<transcript>: So you said you have any F keys binded in Neovim might be an issue for me. I don't really reach for my function keys much. I don't think I do anything in Neil them with my function keys. I use them for like Mac OS stuff like taking screenshots and things like that. But.

00:48:19
<transcript>: i don't

00:48:23
<transcript>: I don't think I use them for like normal. Just editing text.

00:48:34
<transcript>: Taylor, friend of mine operate something similar to Statme's dedicates the world of boxing. Interesting. So our next sports that we're gonna add.

00:48:37
<transcript>: Are probably.

00:48:37
<transcript>: soccer

00:48:38
<transcript>: Soccer.

00:48:38
<transcript>: and

00:48:41
<transcript>: And Cricket, sorry, football.

00:48:41
<transcript>: football

00:48:42
<transcript>: Football.

00:48:42
<transcript>: internet

00:48:43
<transcript>: Internet.

00:48:43
<transcript>: the real foot

00:48:46
<transcript>: The Real Football, not the American football.

00:48:51
schrew: woo go soccer!

00:48:53
<transcript>: Have you ever post your Neovim configs and so forth so people can check out what your new event experience is like Yes.

00:48:57
cowfacedude99: I don't think I have used any Fn key other than F2 and F7

00:48:58

00:53:07
<transcript>: stop it

00:53:08
<transcript>: Stop it, stop it.

00:53:16

00:53:22
cowfacedude99: are you sure?

00:53:25
<transcript>: Okay, so import player layout. I'm not gonna need that. I'm gonna need a game layout. We'll create a game layout.

00:53:30
<transcript>: Game on Astro.

00:53:35
<transcript>: And we'll copy everything from player.

00:53:37
<transcript>: Maybe.

00:53:42
<transcript>: Best.

00:53:44
<transcript>: Okay.

00:53:47
<transcript>: But we're gonna call it.

00:53:50
<transcript>: College.

00:53:53
<transcript>: What is all this? This is the player layout.

00:53:55
<transcript>: Okay.

00:53:59
<transcript>: Down here we're going to use.

00:53:59
<transcript>: this

00:54:02
<transcript>: This Game layout.

00:54:09
<transcript>: Game. Astro, cool, cool, cool, cool, grid. Sure. We'll need a grid.

00:54:12
<transcript>: Air Gallery Don't think we'll need that.

00:54:19
<transcript>: Okay, what? Params? Will we have not League? Yeah, we will have League, not player. We'll have game.

00:54:22
<transcript>: So that's gonna be game.

00:54:37
<transcript>: Oh calface. A challenge to make me into a linux user? Did I mention I used arch, by the way.

00:54:40
<transcript>: I used it once.

00:54:42
<transcript>: That count for anything.

00:54:46
<transcript>: I use it for like a day to make a YouTube video.

00:54:46
<transcript>: it was nice

00:54:51
<transcript>: It was nice. I see the appeal. I three. It's nice, I get it.

00:54:56
<transcript>: I don't know if I could ever use it as my daily driver.

00:54:56
<transcript>: because

00:54:58
thdxr: adam people are saying asahi linux works well as a daily driver now

00:54:58
<transcript>: Because.

00:54:58
o_fruit_o: That joke never gets old ResidentSleeper

00:55:03
<transcript>: All right. Streaming and stuff. And I stream like, I don't know.

00:55:03
<transcript>: months

00:55:06
<transcript>: Months out of the year people.

00:55:08
<transcript>: Months.

00:55:09
thdxr: I stream on linux

00:55:16
thdxr: it's possible!

00:55:21
<transcript>: That joke never gets old. Yeah. Can I say I use arts, by the way, is that just as good as I use arch. Can you even tell I can say it with a straight face? I used arch.

00:55:24
<transcript>: Oh, Steve, speaking of things.

00:55:24
<transcript>: you stream

00:55:28
<transcript>: You stream on links. I don't know, dax. I don't know. I don't know.

00:55:31
<transcript>: I don't know.

00:55:36
cowfacedude99: can't say you did since you didn't show it on stream

00:55:42
<transcript>: Feel like there's something I use that would not work, although I have simplified my stream a lot like I've cut out a whole lot of stuff. I really I just run an obs now.

00:55:42
thdxr: but your nice audio interface won't work

00:55:45
barely_usable: you said you wake up at 4, does your S/O wake up at that time as well?

00:55:47
fragaverage: Isn't Mac the best of all world now?

00:55:58
<transcript>: Oh, I didn't do it on stream. So if I don't use linux on screen, it doesn't count. Okay, okay. My nice audio interface won't work. Oh, yeah. Dax, I was gonna plug that in and tell you if it works for sure.

00:55:59
fragaverage: Awaits witch hunt

00:56:03
<transcript>: Barely usable know my spouse does not wake up at 04:00 a.m. She would think that's hilarious.

00:56:13
benkelly86: I do feel like Mac is a good middle ground. Coming from a Linux guy

00:56:17
<transcript>: Just that someone thought she woke up before him because she wakes up as late as possible, which right now is 07:00 a.m.. That's one of my boys wake up, but she would sleep much later. In fact, before we had boys, we were married for like six years before we had our kids.

00:56:17
<transcript>: and

00:56:37
<transcript>: And she sleeped up ten. I mean, she is. She's a sleeper. She likes to stay up late. She likes to wake up late, although she knows she's read some stuff now that it's better to go to bed early and wake up early like there's natural rhythms that maybe are better for our body. I don't know. But if all else equal and she were just allowed to do what she wants, she would sleep very late.

00:56:41
<transcript>: And I love waking up early, so we're kind of opposite on that front.

00:56:42
daneoshiga: something you use is hosted on arch probably, so you can say you use it, sure.

00:56:44
mhuggins7278: I tend to stay up late but I still have to wake up early :(

00:56:51
thdxr: Macs are the best (if you're a baby)

00:56:54
barely_usable: you guys are like the inverse of me and my gf, i stay up late and shes always in bed early LUL

00:56:55
<transcript>: Isn't Mac the best of all world? Now that's what I'm saying, frag Mac, it's eunuchs. Come on, it's based on unix or something.

00:56:55
<transcript>: i don't know anything

00:56:56
<transcript>: I don't know anything about what I'm talking about, but I'm pretty sure.

00:56:58
<transcript>: If you're a baby.

00:57:03
fragaverage: @thdxr :O

00:57:06
o_fruit_o: Mac is based from *BSD?

00:57:12
<transcript>: Then Kelly says, it's a good middle ground. Thank you, Ben.

00:57:18
<transcript>: Something you use is hosted on arch. Probably so you can still use it for sure. Exactly.

00:57:20
o_fruit_o: Or one of the BSDs

00:57:23
<transcript>: Sorry, Ben. I know so many bins. I'm probably just gonna say Ben Kelly every time because.

00:57:23
<transcript>: every bi

00:57:26
<transcript>: Every bin I refer to. I have to qualify.

00:57:26
<transcript>: i have like three

foobfoob: are you still working on/with AWS IQ or are you full on statmuse now?

00:57:37
<transcript>: Isn't better Lee opposites.

00:57:42
<transcript>: Mac is based from Star bsd or one of the BSDs.

00:57:45
<transcript>: I don't know what that means.

00:58:01
<transcript>: Are you still working on with aws iq? Are you full on status now? Well, if the irs asks, I'm not fulltime at that news because I think that's bad. I think contractors. You're not those people. Yeah, I think. I don't know. I only work on stamus.

00:58:01
<transcript>: insight project

00:58:06
barely_usable: have you just always woken up this early so you're just set in your ways or is this something you changed to do?

00:58:06
<transcript>: Insight projects like rebates TV. But that's all.

00:58:08
benkelly86: Haha no worries. I think I was on your first stream, or at least your very very early streams

00:58:16
<transcript>: Have you just always woken up this early? So you're just set in your waves? Or is this something you change to do? No. I've always.

00:58:16
<transcript>: enjoyed

<transcript>: Enjoyed, like the early morning hours. I don't know something about it. I just enjoy.

<transcript>: When it's dark, everybody's asleep. I get so much more done. Like when my boys are asleep. It's quiet.

00:58:27

kisancodes: what happened to public dot dev

00:59:14
<transcript>: I got to set a precedent. It's not that I have to get something done on this stream. It's that I have to set a precedent that I'm going to try to get stuff done while on stream. I gotta make it sustainable. You know, I want to be here every day, and if I'm here every day, that means I should probably be getting things done while I'm streaming. That would be an important thing to do. Tarot's List thank you so much for the follow.

00:59:18
<transcript>: I'm sorry that it didn't pop up on the screen. I'll have that fixed sometime this week.

<transcript>: so

00:59:44

01:00:12
<transcript>: i've seen

01:00:14
<transcript>: I've seen people do that on Twitter.

01:00:22
o_fruit_o: You're like that distracted BF meme.

01:00:24

01:00:24
<transcript>: what i what

01:00:37
trivenge: https://github.com/Splode/pomotroid something like this?

01:00:38

01:01:54
<transcript>: i've been working

01:02:01
<transcript>: I've been working in astro now for months in the ovm, and there's just a few things that are not ideal.

01:02:07
<transcript>: It's not astrophot. Well, it might be. I don't know, but it's like I can't go to definition.

01:02:12
<transcript>: There's just a few things that are kind of weird with the lsp.

01:02:12
<transcript>: and i kept thinking they did

01:02:14
<transcript>: And I kept thinking, they did better. They're not better yet.

01:02:20
<transcript>: Okay. So in order to render this page.

01:02:23
<transcript>: Again, this is what it should look like.

01:02:23

<transcript>: I hadn't seen it yet. I know. One of our guys, Eric, has been working on it. Oh, that's probably why they did the border, because it's like, this is a thing. This is the thing. We should change that color, soften it up a bit. You know, I'm saying.

01:03:36
<transcript>: open up

01:03:38
<transcript>: Open up the borders.

01:03:38
<transcript>: the

01:03:43
okufa_f: is statmuse still hiring?

01:03:45
iamdavidhill: Never go full #000000

01:03:52
<transcript>: The comments from the lsd drive me crazy is I think it's the lsd could be a different plugin. Yeah. I don't know. Something about my Astro experience is not ideal in the oven. I don't complain much because I love any of them. I love Astro. I'm just kind of making it work.

01:03:52
<transcript>: are you keeping

01:04:02
<transcript>: Are you keeping up with the mba? Not too much. O kufa. I've kind of gotten more into the NFL, which is weird. I feel like such a I don't know American flag toting.

01:04:02
<transcript>: man

01:04:05
thdxr: I just messaged fred asking if you can use astro without .astro files because the lsp glitchiness bothers me

01:04:22
<transcript>: Man, I don't know. I don't like admitting that I've gotten into the NFL, but like, I live in Missouri, and Patrick maholmes is really good. And it's fun to watch him. And I think I just fell out of love with sports. Ironically, after five years at Stapmes, I just kind of got burned out, like we did a lot of fun sports things. And then I just kind of got tired of sports. I didn't watch him anymore.

01:04:22
<transcript>: and then

01:04:30
<transcript>: And then patching my homes came along, and it's kind of like this is exciting. And I got kind of into that. But I'm not really following the the NBA closely.

01:04:33
<transcript>: David literally hiding from my screen.

01:04:42
<transcript>: Yeah. David, I don't know what the rule is about having a solid black border on this site, but I feel like there should be a rule. You should not have any solid black borders.

01:04:54
<transcript>: Is stat me still hiring. So I think so. I'll talk to my co founder. I'm not entirely sure. Never go full zero. Zero. That's right. David.

01:04:54
<transcript>: i knew

01:04:59
<transcript>: I knew, I knew intuitively. I had a guy feeling that was a rule.

01:04:59
<transcript>: just

01:05:06
<transcript>: Just message, Fred, ask if you can use astro without astrophiles. Because the lsp. Glitchiness. Bothers me. Yeah, dax, find answers.

01:05:25
<transcript>: Fred said he'd come on my stream. We should get Fred to come on the stream. Maybe once I've gotten a little more inner rhythm, I'm actually getting stuff done, you know, like right now, I'm not getting anything done. Maybe once we're actually working in astrophiles, we'll bring Fred on, and he can fix my lsp or take it back to the team or something. I don't know.

01:05:32
<transcript>: Okay.

01:05:42
<transcript>: This is the page we're making. Let's make it.

01:05:44
<transcript>: I guess this header.

01:05:44
<transcript>: this head

01:05:46
<transcript>: This header is just like.

01:05:49
<transcript>: The Answer page, header.

01:05:50
<transcript>: Ah how.

01:05:50
<transcript>: this

01:05:54
<transcript>: This header. Oh, wait. Drive a layout for that.

01:06:00
<transcript>: I have a layout for that franchise. Team player.

01:06:02
<transcript>: Let's just look at it.

01:06:04
<transcript>: So the query page.

01:06:04
<transcript>: layout

01:06:07
<transcript>: Layout, and then header.

01:06:10
<transcript>: Oh, that's like the that's like the site header.

01:06:10
<transcript>: but where

01:06:14
<transcript>: But Where's the is it just this stuff.

01:06:17
<transcript>: This might be it.

01:06:20
<transcript>: Let's just drop this.

01:06:23
<transcript>: In our game layout.

01:06:30
<transcript>: Instead of this thing, I guess.

01:06:34
<transcript>: This container. Here.

01:06:44
<transcript>: I think it's this container here that I need to.

01:06:51
<transcript>: Replace.

01:06:58
<transcript>: Theory.

01:07:05
<transcript>: I guess I should just dig into this. What am I doing.

01:07:05
<transcript>: i

01:07:08
<transcript>: I swear I use neovim all the time.

01:07:08
<transcript>: that's all i

01:07:16
<transcript>: That's all I use people. That's all I use get off my case. I don't know why suddenly I don't remember how to do anything.

01:07:19
<transcript>: Answered on here we go.

01:07:26
<transcript>: This doesn't make any sense. A layout, is it in the main layout file.

01:07:31
<transcript>: Is it in here? Surely not.

01:07:38
<transcript>: For a while.

01:07:45
<transcript>: I feel like this is it.

01:07:45
<transcript>: let's do this

01:07:46
<transcript>: Let's do this.

01:07:46
<transcript>: this

01:07:50
<transcript>: This is the query page. Let's do this. Let's do.

01:08:00
<transcript>: Let's do this.

01:08:02
<transcript>: Just look at the query page.

01:08:08
<transcript>: I've only done the top. Oh, I did actually have the grid. Okay.

01:08:17
<transcript>: So we'll turn on the drop this whole part right here. That looks exactly the same right on a game page. Yeah, Yeah.

01:08:22
<transcript>: Okay.

01:08:27
<transcript>: So let's just do this.

01:08:31
<transcript>: I like comment this whole thing out. If I just delete it.

01:08:31
<transcript>: yeah

01:08:34
<transcript>: Yeah, it's this tag.

01:08:37
<transcript>: Delete the whole tab, what to do.

01:08:41
<transcript>: Okay, cool.

01:08:46
<transcript>: So that is the tag that I want to copy.

01:08:51
<transcript>: I just feel like I switched into serious mode, and I just started working.

01:08:51
<transcript>: is this weird

01:08:52
<transcript>: Is this weird.

01:08:52
<transcript>: are we okay with me

01:08:54
<transcript>: Are we okay with me? Working.

01:08:54
<transcript>: is that okay

01:08:56
<transcript>: Is that okay with everybody.

01:08:58
<transcript>: Can I just work.

01:09:05
<transcript>: Let's pretend I have a pomodoro timer.

01:09:05
<transcript>: and it's going

01:09:06
<transcript>: And it's going right now.

01:09:10
<transcript>: It's like focus. And then a little belt. Take a break.

01:09:20
<transcript>: It into here.

01:09:22
<transcript>: Them and delete this one.

01:09:25
<transcript>: Right.

01:09:27
<transcript>: They're gonna work.

01:09:31
<transcript>: Because we don't have that data. But I can get that data.

01:09:34
<transcript>: Thanks. Imagine the game layout. Yeah.

01:09:40
<transcript>: Oh, no. Oh, no. That means I deleted a bunch of stuff out of the.

01:09:44
<transcript>: Oh no no.

01:09:44
<transcript>: it was this

01:09:46
<transcript>: It was this down here? Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

01:09:51
<transcript>: So how do I get that data? Let's see.

01:09:54
<transcript>: Question.

01:09:54
<transcript>: respons

01:09:56
<transcript>: Response data answer.

01:10:00
<transcript>: So for a game.

01:10:00
<transcript>: for

01:10:05
<transcript>: For a game page like this? What data am I using.

01:10:08
<transcript>: Oh, that's on a game page.

01:10:13
<transcript>: This one.

01:10:18
<transcript>: I bet I get it from like a game result.

01:10:20
<transcript>: Yeah, Yeah.

01:10:31
<transcript>: Okay. I'm gonna show secret stuff. Kind of kind of not. This is statmese code. Don't look at it. Don't look too closely. But I'm gonna have to reference it a lot. So you're probably gonna see a lot of it.

01:10:41
<transcript>: I'm gonna need some code for fetching data.

01:10:51
<transcript>: Teamseason, game results.

01:10:53
<transcript>: We want.

01:11:02
<transcript>: The player game log, player splits. Okay, I need I know what I need.

01:11:06
<transcript>: Camera.

01:11:17
<transcript>: Come on.

01:11:19
<transcript>: Is that page.

01:12:22
<transcript>: That is the one.

01:12:24
<transcript>: Come on.

<transcript>: to my

01:12:48
<transcript>: To my stream where I have not been streaming, but I am streaming now.

01:12:51
<transcript>: Let's see, I want.

01:13:05
<transcript>: So gamera is our nlp api. It's what answers the questions. So you pass it the sports question.

01:13:05
<transcript>: it returns a bunch

01:13:07
<transcript>: It returns a bunch of data.

01:13:13
<transcript>: It's called gamera, because all of our.

01:13:19
<transcript>: All of our projects over repository named after godzilla, monsters.

01:13:19
<transcript>: that

01:13:21
<transcript>: That's fun.

01:13:25
<transcript>: Okay, I want to find the game endpoints.

01:13:28
<transcript>: Nba games.

01:13:32
<transcript>: This is the one.

01:13:36
<transcript>: Okay. We're gonna create a file.

01:13:36
<transcript>: called

01:13:38
<transcript>: Called Game Yes.

01:13:40
<transcript>: The yank.

01:13:43
<transcript>: Yank dysfunction.

01:13:53
<transcript>: Did I not make it. I did not yank it. I want to yaff. It.

<transcript>: aim

01:14:05
<transcript>: Aim.

01:14:07
<transcript>: Maybe.

01:14:13
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:14:17
<transcript>: That's a game ID.

01:14:17
<transcript>: we get

01:14:20
<transcript>: We get back data that looks like this.

01:14:27
<transcript>: To the other stuff.

01:14:27
<transcript>: visual this

01:14:30
<transcript>: Visual. This is very similar to an answer, isn't it.

01:14:39
<transcript>: I think this is exactly like the answer response.

01:14:42
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:14:45
<transcript>: Okay.

01:14:45
<transcript>: so

01:14:48
<transcript>: So it's gonna be gamera api. Url.

01:14:55
<transcript>: Where does that come from.

01:15:00
<transcript>: Api. Url. There it is.

01:15:12
<transcript>: Pars player ID. Do I need to do that for a game? Id. I don't know. Probably.

01:15:15
<transcript>: Probably. Okay. I'm taking a break.

01:15:17
<transcript>: Whoo.

01:15:20
<transcript>: That was tough.

01:15:20
<transcript>: i focus

01:15:24
<transcript>: I focused for like 15 minutes. There.

01:15:27
<transcript>: Was this hard? My brain kind of hurts.

01:15:33
<transcript>: So I thought of something I wanted to talk about. If anyone's still here. I'm not working. People come back.

01:15:35
<transcript>: I played among us.

01:15:35
<transcript>: with some

01:15:38
<transcript>: With some friends Saturday.

01:15:38
<transcript>: and

01:15:40
amberdev: 15 min focus... :D

01:15:41
<transcript>: And wow, is that fun.

01:15:43
tayloreddev: i'm back

01:15:43
zol0: i haven't focused for 15 mins in like the past 6 months

01:15:43
grasp5533: Nice

01:15:45
trivenge: among us is fun yeah lol

01:15:46
<transcript>: So fun. That's right, Amber. 15 minutes of Ogus.

01:15:46
<transcript>: is that how pomo

01:15:47
schrew: toxic elmore?

01:15:48
<transcript>: Is that how pomodoro timers work.

01:15:53
<transcript>: I'm focused for 15 minutes in the past six months. Yeah. Me needs result. It was tough.

01:15:53
<transcript>: i'm

01:15:54
tayloreddev: Never played

01:15:55
<transcript>: I'mong us.

01:15:55

<transcript>: So fun.

01:15:58
<transcript>: So.

01:15:58
<transcript>: there i didn't

01:16:09
<transcript>: There. I didn't stream it. And if I ever do play again, I'll probably stream it because I bet it would be fun to stream it, but it was with like a bunch of people that were streaming it so you can go watch the VOD.

01:16:18
<transcript>: Yeah. I'd never played. So I was terrible. And I felt bad at some point because I realized, like, oh, this game's probably not very fun if you're playing with people who don't know what they're doing.

01:16:21
<transcript>: But for me, it was a blast.

01:16:25
trivenge: no its fun either way lol

01:16:26
<transcript>: Just basically like a game where you lie to each other the entire time.

01:16:26
<transcript>: it's really fun

01:16:27
tayloreddev: d0nut isn't happy with you LUL

01:16:27
<transcript>: It's really fun.

01:16:27
<transcript>: thanks

01:16:31
<transcript>: Thanks. Feel alive. It's funny the way even if you're new okay.

01:16:31
<transcript>: donut is

01:16:31
stiefbroerikzitvast: didnt you sell statmuse?

01:16:33
trivenge: much better in discord lol

01:16:33
<transcript>: Donut. Is it happening? Yeah.

01:16:36
<transcript>: Donut was.

01:16:36
<transcript>: i

01:16:40
stiefbroerikzitvast: it was what made you the millionaire

01:16:44
<transcript>: I killed him while he's doing these. Simon says thing. It's like it takes a long time. And I killed him. And when I was leaving.

01:16:47
stiefbroerikzitvast: multi*

01:16:56
trivenge: LUL

01:17:02
<transcript>: I was like, all right, see, everybody, this was so fun. Thanks so much for having me. And I hadn't left yet. I hadn't left discord. I'm, like, trying to figure out I don't I'm old. I don't know how to even leave a discord call. So I'm trying to figure out how do I, like, get out of the discord call, and I hear donut go. Well. Unfortunately, we can't invite Adam back because he killed me while I was doing sinuses. I'm like, what.

01:17:05
<transcript>: I'm listening. I'm right here.

01:17:07
schrew: LUL

01:17:09
<transcript>: Yeah. So he wasn't happy.

01:17:09
<transcript>: i hope

01:17:14
<transcript>: I hope you invite me back. Did I sell Samuel Step, Ro.

01:17:14
<transcript>: i

01:17:19
<transcript>: I sold some of my shares of Statmeues. Yes.

01:17:20
<transcript>: But.

01:17:20
<transcript>: but

01:17:22
<transcript>: But makes you a billionaire.

01:17:26
<transcript>: I still own some of that news.

01:17:26
<transcript>: some of

01:17:27
<transcript>: Some of it.

01:17:41
<transcript>: Are you sewn 50% of it when me and my cofounder started it and that number just goes down and down and down and down and down and down and down, the more you raise money.

01:17:41
<transcript>: the more people

01:17:45
<transcript>: The more people join the team and you give them shares.

01:17:45
<transcript>: and

01:17:48
<transcript>: And not it's fine, it's good.

01:17:51
<transcript>: What's the saying? I'd rather own.

01:17:54
<transcript>: A sliver of a big thumb.

01:17:54
<transcript>: than

01:17:59
<transcript>: Than all of the little things or something or just saying about that.

01:17:59
<transcript>: anybody

01:18:02
<transcript>: Anybody remember that saying anybody ever heard that one.

01:18:02
<transcript>: like

01:18:09
<transcript>: Like don't be stingy with your equity. Give it out freely. You want to grow the thing sprinkle that everywhere.

01:18:19
<transcript>: Anyway, among us super fun. If there's like ten people that want to play among us, just let me know anytime I will literally play. Probably anytime you ask.

01:18:19
<transcript>: because

01:18:21
thdxr: uh oh adam we're not solving real business problems: https://twitter.com/jensneuse_de/status/1632426067909656576

01:18:27
amberdev: 5% of 100 companies better than 100% of 1 company

01:18:31
mhuggins7278: as long as the value keeps going up go for it

01:18:31
<transcript>: Because I want to play it more. And it was a lot of fun. Dax, we're gonna make it happen, right? I don't know if dax is still here. Oh, dex is here. Uhoh, Adam, we're not solving real business problems. Uhoh, what happened? Something on Twitter. It's gonna make me really angry. Let's see.

01:18:40
<transcript>: Hot take if you have time to worry about nonsense like signals, you're not solving real business problems.

01:18:40
<transcript>: we're so far

01:18:44
trivenge: its fun, should get people together on discord one time. play a couple sessions of among us lol

01:18:48
<transcript>: We're so far beyond 80 20 with these frontend micro optimization things do something that actually gets you cutters.

01:18:51
<transcript>: All right.

01:18:55
<transcript>: So what I like about that statement is.

01:18:59
<transcript>: I've had this feeling.

01:18:59
<transcript>: for

01:19:11
<transcript>: For a while, but I don't want to say this out, like anywhere. Dax, I'm gonna say it right here. This is a safe place, but I mostly don't want to put it on Twitter because I never want to get kicked out of that super fun server.

01:19:11
<transcript>: on discord

01:19:12
<transcript>: On discord.

01:19:32
<transcript>: Where you all just talk about front end stuff. And somehow I'm in there listening. But I do feel like there's part of that tweet that resonate, which is like, I feel like the smartest minds and technology right now are all focused on, like, this kind of tiny little thing, like the front end. How fast can you render something on the front end? Like, is that the most important thing in computer science right now? Because.

01:19:37
<transcript>: There are a million people trying to solve that problem and the smartest people in our industry.

01:19:37
<transcript>: and

01:19:41
<transcript>: And I don't know. Feels like there's other stuff. Probably we could devote some attention to.

01:19:41
<transcript>: but yeah

01:19:45
thdxr: this isn't a safe space, I'm telling theo

01:19:49
<transcript>: But yeah, otherwise, I agree with that. Tweet. I mean, I agree with your feeling that, like, real business problems. Okay.

01:19:49
trivenge: like physics?

01:19:50
stiefbroerikzitvast: bro you got more than 500k followers on twitter for statmuse

01:19:50
trivenge: LUL

01:19:51
<transcript>: Stop it.

01:19:54
mhuggins7278: for work I agree for learning it's fun as a thought exercise

01:19:58
<transcript>: I'm not keeping up with chat, right.

01:20:01
<transcript>: 5% of 100 companies.

01:20:01
<transcript>: better than one

01:20:06
<transcript>: Better than 100% of one company. That's a good point. So you're saying, just buy stocks, don't do startups.

01:20:10
<transcript>: As long as the value keeps going up for it.

01:20:19
<transcript>: Or going up? Yeah. Going up. Go for it. Got it. It's fun. Should get people together on discord one time, play a couple sessions of a month. Yes. Triv.

01:20:19
<transcript>: trivia

01:20:20
<transcript>: Trivia.

01:20:23
stiefbroerikzitvast: how is statmuse monetized?

01:20:27

01:20:28
<transcript>: Bro, you got more than 5000 followers on Twitter for status. Yes, stat. Muse does very well on the social media.

01:20:28
<transcript>: it gets

01:20:33
<transcript>: It gets a whole lot of traffic. It turns out that people are very passionate about sports.

01:20:33
<transcript>: so when you

01:20:41
<transcript>: So when you say things about sports a lot on Twitter, eventually you will have 500,005 followers. I don't know. Maybe that's not true.

01:20:41
<transcript>: but people

01:20:46
<transcript>: But people get very passionate about their sports and their teams.

01:20:51
<transcript>: For work. I agree for learning. It's fun as a thought exercise.

01:20:54
<transcript>: I forgot what we were talking about.

01:20:55
amberdev: I am not human. I don't care about sports.

01:21:03
mhuggins7278: the signals stuff

01:21:06
<transcript>: Are you talking about front end Mr. Huggins? Oh, I said Mr. It doesn't say Mr. How is that muse monetized? Poorly. Now, just kidding.

01:21:11
trivenge: the jocks win in the end if AI dominate the programming world. because AI and robots wont be overtaking sports any time soon, if ever LUL so in the end, the jocks win, right? LUL

01:21:18
<transcript>: We have a few different revenue streams. We're working on a bigger one. But we do like ads on the page. And we get, like, 50 million page views a month or something like that. So we do some ad revenue.

01:21:18
<transcript>: we

01:21:24
<transcript>: We do some stuff with teams, we have to deal with the spn at one point I don't know if that's still going.

01:21:26
<transcript>: I know we have like a merch.

01:21:26
<transcript>: we have

01:21:28
<transcript>: We have a shop.

01:21:30
<transcript>: Signals. Rerender.

01:21:37
<transcript>: Amber, you're not human this whole time. I just thought you were human. That's crazy.

01:21:40
<transcript>: The signals? Oh, yeah, yeah, I got you.

01:21:40
<transcript>: huggins

01:21:42
<transcript>: Huggins.

01:21:53
<transcript>: The jocks went in the end, if AI dominate the programming world because AI and robots won't be overtaking sports anytime soon, if ever so in the end, the jocks win. Right? That's funny.

01:22:01
<transcript>: I was actually way more into sports than I was technology for.

01:22:03
<transcript>: A good chunk of my life.

01:22:08
dnbull: wow, statmuse looks cool but I never heard of it. Is this your company?

01:22:11
<transcript>: It's funny to think now because I just I care so much about technology, and I care so little about sports.

01:22:11
<transcript>: last time

01:22:19
<transcript>: Last time he said school. But I've never heard of it. Is this your company? Yes. The End Bull. I started it back in 2014.

01:22:19
<transcript>: with

01:22:22
<transcript>: With a lifelong friend named Eli.

01:22:22
<transcript>: and i

01:22:25
<transcript>: And I was gone for a few years. Like when you saw me stream before.

01:22:25
<transcript>: i

01:22:29
<transcript>: I was on, like a three year hiatus, but I just went back.

01:22:32
<transcript>: In the last six months or so.

01:22:35
<transcript>: I.

01:22:44
<transcript>: Should I actually do some work again? I don't know. That was hard. It was hard to focus when I know you're all here with me. I know I get used to it.

01:22:44
<transcript>: but it's just

01:22:47
dnbull: nice. I'm a huge basketball fan

01:22:48
stiefbroerikzitvast: ran out of money so he has to do actual work now again Kappa

01:22:50
<transcript>: But it's just kind of like I want to talk because I haven't talked to you also long, just like seeing friends for the first time in years.

01:22:53
<transcript>: It's been months, but.

01:23:00
schrew: 25 minute pomodoro, go!

01:23:01
<transcript>: I can't just talk to you. All you guys have stuff to do, right.

01:23:01

01:23:21
tayloreddev: i'd like to learn more about the almost acquisitions

01:23:24
<transcript>: And statmes my cofounder reached out at the right time where I was questioning everything.

01:23:24
<transcript>: and

01:23:30
<transcript>: And it made sense 25 minutes pomodoro go true no.

01:23:30
<transcript>: ziyais thank

01:23:33
<transcript>: Ziyais, thank you so much to follow. I appreciate that. Follow.

01:23:44
amberdev: I need to spend some time on my QMK.. :( Switching workspaces by numbers kind of sucks.

01:23:47
<transcript>: I have zero things to do in life. I get it. That's how I felt. And then I joined. Sammy, you should join stand these two. I'd like to learn more about the almost acquisitions. Ooh, there's. There's a story. Okay, I'll tell those stories real quick.

01:23:52
schrew: sorry, was trying to tell that to myself LUL

01:23:53
daglee: After last stream, it felt like something was missing. Then it hit me, you never had a l√§rabar!

01:23:59
<transcript>: I mean, I'll tell you what I can tell. I don't know what I can tell you. I maybe shouldn't say anything at all, but that's what my cofounder always knows those things. And I'm always like, oh, I can't just say anything I want ever. Oh, okay.

01:23:59
<transcript>: i'm

01:24:07
<transcript>: I'm gonna say a little bit. So Disney and Google have both invested in Statmeues, and it varies times, both.

01:24:07
<transcript>: attempted actions

01:24:08
<transcript>: Attempted actions.

01:24:11
<transcript>: And here's the thing about getting acquired.

01:24:11
<transcript>: it's really hard

01:24:13
<transcript>: It's really hard to get acquired.

01:24:13
<transcript>: if

01:24:14
<transcript>: If.

01:24:14
<transcript>: when you

01:24:16
<transcript>: When you raise money.

01:24:16
<transcript>: you're valued

01:24:18
<transcript>: You're valued too highly.

01:24:18
<transcript>: so

01:24:22
<transcript>: So we rose our A, our series a.

01:24:22
<transcript>: pretty

01:24:22
dnbull: any plans with statmuse branching to esports?

01:24:26
<transcript>: Pretty quickly, like right after we raised our seed.

01:24:26
<transcript>: and

01:24:31
<transcript>: And it was a very competitive A. We had multiple people trying to lead the a.

01:24:31
<transcript>: dis

01:24:37
<transcript>: Disney ended up leading the A, and Disney is not a venture capital firm.

01:24:37
<transcript>: they are

01:24:44
<transcript>: They are a strategic partner. Like through ESPN, we had a good relationship with Disney. We were in the Disney accelerator, but they don't necessarily.

01:24:52
lukeyfam15: Wow your back

01:24:55
<transcript>: Do. They don't lead a lot of rounds, right? They're not like venture capitalists. They don't. I don't know. We could have also just been part of the market at that point. Like it was a very hot market.

01:24:55
<transcript>: and

01:24:57
stiefbroerikzitvast: did you get to meet Mickey Mouse?

01:25:06
<transcript>: And they led that a and we were valued at $35 million. And there were three. It was like three guys, just like hanging out. Building sat mews. And we were valued too highly, too quickly. It was very early.

01:25:06
<transcript>: and

01:25:08
<transcript>: And.

01:25:28
<transcript>: So we had that sort of target set at 35 million. And at that point, it was very hard to get acquired because all these companies looked at us. And when they started doing real diligence, it's like, oh, so what do we acquire? We're acquiring your team of, like, five at that point, like when we were trying to get acquired, it's like there's five of you. And like.

01:25:28
<transcript>: you have a cool

01:25:39
amberdev: That is how VC works. They are interested in overvaluation.

01:25:39
<transcript>: You have a cool product. People love it. But like, you don't have revenue. And like, we can't buy you for multiple of 35 million. That's basically what the problem was. It's like the valuation that was said at the a.

01:25:39
<transcript>: everyone gets

01:25:51
<transcript>: Everyone gets really excited to lead your A. And like, sure, set a number doesn't matter, and then down the road. It does matter, because when you're trying to get acquired and returned capital to investors, you have to clear those numbers.

01:25:51
<transcript>: and

01:25:55
<transcript>: And we were just too expensive. That's basically what it came into.

01:25:55
<transcript>: so we almost

01:25:58
<transcript>: So we almost got acquired by Disney a couple times.

01:25:58
<transcript>: almost

01:26:18
nexxeln: yoo

01:26:18
<transcript>: Almost by Google. That was the closest I think we got probably, I don't know. Disney might have been the closest. And then Apple. Apple started. They started the conversation. And then Eddie Q got reassigned within Apple to some other. He was over, siri. And they got moved somewhere else. He was the big sports fan that was excited about it. They were gonna buy us, like, put us.

01:26:18
<transcript>: in siri

01:26:20
<transcript>: In Siri.

01:26:23
amberdev: How do they reach you?

01:26:24
<transcript>: Yeah. So that one didn't go very far, but.

01:26:33
<transcript>: Let's see after last stream felt like something was missing. That hit me. You never had a lara bar. Daglie. I didn't have a lar bar. I will try and have one on this stream.

01:26:42

01:27:18
<transcript>: I was answering something. Oh, yeah, I esport. So funny story. We originally had every intention of being in the Esports. We were gonna do legal Legends. And dota, I think, or something. I don't know. We had some Esports that we were targeting. We even hired a guy to build our Esports database.

01:27:21
<transcript>: He worked for us for months.

01:27:21
<transcript>: and then we

01:27:25
<transcript>: And then we learned he wasn't actually working for us. He was just playing esports.

01:27:31
dnbull: LUL

01:27:31
nexxeln: LUL

01:27:32
<transcript>: He's just playing playing games. He wasn't actually doing anything. So we we had some stuff that he put together, but it was like, okay.

01:27:32
<transcript>: abandoned

01:27:33
grasp5533: I just hit Plat in league yesterday lol

01:27:34
lukeyfam15: You didn't say Hi to me

01:27:36
<transcript>: Abandoned, abandoned ship. It did not go well.

01:27:41
<transcript>: That's what they say. Hire higher, slow firefast, right.

01:27:41
<transcript>: got

01:27:42
<transcript>: Got.

01:27:42
<transcript>: gotta get people

01:27:45
<transcript>: Gotta get people out of there when they're not doing.

01:27:45
<transcript>: a good job

01:27:46
<transcript>: A good job.

01:27:48
dnbull: Get hired to do esports DB - plays games instead LUL

01:27:53
nexxeln: what are we building today?

01:28:06
<transcript>: That is how vc works. They're interested in overvaluation, I guess so. That's what they did to us. I mean, they did. We accepted it. So it's whatever. But we didn't know. I mean, we were like, brand new to startups. This is our first time around the startup thing. And I don't think we knew what a good valuation.

01:28:06
<transcript>: would be

01:28:09
stiefbroerikzitvast: i got hired to stream, im just watching streams all day

01:28:13
<transcript>: Would be for an A, and it's like, sure, bigger number means we give you less of our money or less of our equity.

01:28:13
<transcript>: so

01:28:14
stiefbroerikzitvast: much more convenient for me

01:28:16
<transcript>: So we wanted a big valuation, of course.

01:28:16
<transcript>: but

01:28:19
<transcript>: But, yeah, it makes it harder to exit.

01:28:32
amberdev: VC

01:28:35
lilfreezi: the t3 GOD has arrived

01:28:38
amberdev: Ouh

01:28:39
<transcript>: How do they reach you? Nexus here. How does who reach me, Amber? You mean the potential acquirers. If you mean the potential acquirers. We just had good relationships with them already. I think that's how most acquisitions happen. Like it's people you're already working with. So we were working with Disney and ESPN on an ESPN deal to do some stuff.

01:28:39
<transcript>: to the writers

01:28:40
<transcript>: To the writers.

01:28:40
<transcript>: and with google

01:28:50
<transcript>: And with Google, they just invested in us. So we were working with the Google Assistant team on some, like, projects to, like, incorporate Statmes directly into Google assistant.

01:28:50
<transcript>: and that's

01:28:52
amberdev: OK

01:28:59
nexxeln: @LilFreezi üò≥

01:29:01
<transcript>: And that's when they reach out for the acquisition thing, it's like, people you already know. Just one day they send you an email and they're like, hey, this person I'm gonna introduce you to works for Corp. Dev. And then when I talk to you about some stuff.

01:29:01
<transcript>: and that's

01:29:03
<transcript>: And that's kind of how it goes.

01:29:17
<transcript>: I just hit platin yesterday platinum grasp. Look at you. I think that's good. I haven't been around that space in a long time. I don't remember anything, but I think that's really good. Is that the best.

lilfreezi: @nexxeln üòà

01:29:34
<transcript>: Welcome, welcome back. I feel like it's weird to tell you all welcome back when I'm the one that came back, you guys are probably still been on twitch, just hanging out.

01:29:34
<transcript>: but

01:29:38
<transcript>: But welcome back to my stream because I'm streaming.

01:29:44
bmwfan300: Hey ! Hope you're doing well, bud

<transcript>: thank you for the follow b

01:29:57
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow BMW fan. What are we building today? Next we're building, statmes.com. I got hired to stream. I'm just watching streams all day. That's awesome. That's for convenient for me.

01:30:02
<transcript>: Oh, you're just making it. Yeah, I see you're joking. As a joke. I think.

01:30:22
<transcript>: I like this music.

01:30:22
<transcript>: try

01:30:25
<transcript>: Try and some different music and I like it.

01:30:30
<transcript>: I didn't love that scream. That scream. Could I could have done without that.

01:30:36
<transcript>: Still going scream is still going.

01:30:38
<transcript>: In that song. Okay.

01:30:39
nexxeln: what are you gonna use alongside astro? solid?

01:30:43
stiefbroerikzitvast: how many people work at statmuse now?

01:30:46
amberdev: In your opinion, in context of software dev, how important is to get "kitchen" setup right before serving?

01:30:47
<transcript>: Should I do more work? That's the question. What are you gonna use alongside, Astra socks? So next, I thought I was gonna use solid.

01:30:47
<transcript>: and

01:30:56
stiefbroerikzitvast: can you tell a bit about the team? how many devs, and what other roles are there?

01:31:04
<transcript>: And the more I build out status, the more I think I may not even need solid. I might just write some Vanilla js for the little tiny bits of interactivity. Astro makes it nice to do that like riding vanilla js. And Astro feels good because you can write like modern stuff in a little script tag and they just like transpile it and do all the stuff for you.

01:31:04
<transcript>: so

01:31:11
<transcript>: So I don't know. I might just stick with that until I feel like, oh, I could really use something better, more structured here.

01:31:11
<transcript>: because solid feels

01:31:14
<transcript>: Because solid feels nice. Like knowing it's such a small.

01:31:14
<transcript>: runtime

01:31:17
nexxeln: yeah you can even use typescript in the script tag

01:31:20
iamdavidhill: Have you tried Alpine JS?

01:31:22
<transcript>: Runtime footprint like if I need to drop in and add it, but I'm not building a spa, and it just feels weird to use any of these things.

01:31:28
amberdev: I mean, ... CI, build systems, compliance, automation, security...

01:31:37
amberdev: Before even going public?

01:31:38
<transcript>: How many people get Samuel Step, bro.

01:31:38
<transcript>: i

01:31:39
okufa_f: unfortunately im still on the react train. i'd switch to solid, but react's environment is a bit more mature for my liking

01:31:41
<transcript>: I was like ten of us.

01:31:41
<transcript>: at our peak

01:31:47
<transcript>: At our peak, maybe four or five years ago. There's twentyish of us 25, I don't know.

01:31:47
<transcript>: but there's only

01:31:49
<transcript>: But there's only like ten of us now.

01:31:52
<transcript>: And only four engineers actually.

01:31:59
<transcript>: In your opinion in context of software, how important is it to get kitchen set up right before serving.

01:32:02
mhuggins7278: Have you looked at party town at all. (if you have perf issues with 3rd party scripts)

01:32:02
<transcript>: Do you mean like.

01:32:02
<transcript>: in terms of

01:32:05
<transcript>: In terms of like getting a project.

01:32:05
<transcript>: scaffold

01:32:07
<transcript>: Scaffold it out.

01:32:07
<transcript>: or do you mean

01:32:10
<transcript>: Or do you mean like your own personal development environment.

01:32:10
<transcript>: amber

01:32:11
<transcript>: Amber.

01:32:18
<transcript>: Can you tell a bit about the team, how many devs and what other roles? Yeah. So for there's four engineers.

01:32:21
<transcript>: I think it peak. We are like 15 engineers.

01:32:21
<transcript>: so

01:32:23
<transcript>: So there's only four of us.

01:32:31
<transcript>: The other people that we have creatives. So Michael Waltzhock draws all the illustrations. So if you look@samus.com all those player.

01:32:31
<transcript>: photos

01:32:38
<transcript>: Photos. He draws those every single day you have for the last eight years, he's worked at samus three years longer than I have.

01:32:42
<transcript>: Because I left and it was gone for three years, you know.

01:32:42
<transcript>: so

01:32:43
<transcript>: So.

01:32:43
<transcript>: there's

01:32:51
<transcript>: There's Wall Talk who dropped all the illustrations. And then there's Kevin, who does a lot of the Twitter stuff.

01:32:57
bmwfan300: any tips before i make drift game i don't know anything abaut  codeing üòÖ

01:32:59
<transcript>: I'm sorry. I'm still getting to know some of the newer employees that joined while I was gone and I'm blanking on other names. Jordan.

01:33:03
<transcript>: And so the other people do let.

01:33:10
<transcript>: Businessy things in creative things. So writing like we have a newsletter and stuff like that.

01:33:16
<transcript>: But I'm bad at names, and I'm blanking on everybody's name.

01:33:28
<transcript>: Let's see. Yeah you can even use typescript and script tag. Yeah, you can. I'm loving astro. I have not tried alpine js. David I know that's made by.

01:33:28
<transcript>: what's his name

01:33:31
<transcript>: What's his name? What's his name.

01:33:35
<transcript>: That's his name. I forgot his name.

01:33:35
<transcript>: but it

01:33:38
iamdavidhill: Caleb

01:33:39
<transcript>: But it's made by guy that I know from Twitter. I mean, I recognize from Twitter.

01:33:45
<transcript>: C. I. Built Systems Compliance Automation security oh Oh.

01:33:45
<transcript>: before

01:33:46
iamdavidhill: Porzio(?)

01:33:48
<transcript>: Before going public. Oh, I see.

01:33:57

<transcript>: Daniel, this aloha. I think vasalos is last name. I don't know if I'm saying that right. But I saw him tweet something about how things you don't need to launch your thing. And it was like everything.

01:34:17
nexxeln: lmao

01:34:21
<transcript>: And I see his point. Like you could technically launch with none of those boxes checked. I think it just depends on your level of comfort.

01:34:29
<transcript>: I would say, like, dax and I last week launched rebates TV. We launched that site. And that idea into the world.

01:34:29
<transcript>: and

01:34:35
<transcript>: And I don't think we had any of those things that you just said ci. No, we have ci setup now with Seed run.

01:34:35
<transcript>: build system

01:34:38
daglee: Thing you don't need to launch your thing: A working game <- every game company these days.

01:34:41
tayloreddev: I broke it LUL

01:34:43
<transcript>: Build systems. I'll lump that in to ci. I guess compliance. Well, we don't really have a compliance angle with what we're doing. I don't think.

01:34:47
<transcript>: No automation. I guess we had some security.

01:34:48
<transcript>: Inherently.

01:34:58
<transcript>: Unfortunately, I'm still in the React train. I'd switched a solid but reacts environment is a bit more mature from my liking. Yeah, I know. I totally get that react still a fine choice.

01:35:18
<transcript>: Have you looked at Party Town at all? If you have perfect issues with thirdparty scripts? No, I have not. But I've heard of it. I don't know. It. Maybe inhouse. Tell me, what is Party Town? I've definitely heard of it. Caleburgio. Thank you, David. Yes. Any tips before I make drift Game? I don't know anything about coding. What is drift Game? That's my first question. Bmw.

01:35:28
<transcript>: Follow. Hi, Adam. Glad to catch your stream. How do you monetize status that keeps coming up. We're gonna put that on the frequently asked questions.

01:35:28
<transcript>: statmeues

01:35:34
<transcript>: Statmeues does something like 50 million page views a month. So there's some site ads, revenue.

01:35:35
bmwfan300: u drift in car

01:35:38
<transcript>: We also have a shop.

01:35:46
<transcript>: So you can buy merch stat me's merch and we do deals with teams for like inapp stuff in their Stadium apps.

01:35:47
mhuggins7278: it allows you to run your 3rd party scripts in a web workers so they don't block the main thread. Things like add analytics etc

01:35:58
mhuggins7278: ads not add

01:35:59
<transcript>: And I'm probably missing the stuff that's most of it. But we're moving to some subscription model where people who queries that means a lot, like a hundred times a month. They're gonna pay monthly. Some of them.

01:35:59
<transcript>: hopefully

01:36:02
<transcript>: Hopefully like sports better stuff like that.

01:36:07
<transcript>: Thing you don't need to launch your thing a working game.

01:36:12
<transcript>: Every game company these days that's funny, daglie.

01:36:12
<transcript>: you're saying

01:36:17
<transcript>: You're saying people clearly don't need to have a working game before they launch because they keep doing it.

01:36:21
<transcript>: You drift in car.

01:36:23
<transcript>: Oh, you're gonna make a car game.

01:36:23
<transcript>: where you can

01:36:24
daglee: :)

01:36:25
<transcript>: Where you can drift in it.

01:36:29
bmwfan300: yes

01:36:30
<transcript>: Dough. Shame. What did you. What did you break? Taylor? You broke something.

01:36:36
<transcript>: It allows you to run your third party scripts in a Web workers.

01:36:42
<transcript>: So they don't block the main thread things like add analytics, etc. Okay.

01:36:42
<transcript>: that sounds

01:36:44
okufa_f: with the advent of ai within the past months, do you see statmuse improving or now in jeopardy?

01:36:45
<transcript>: That sounds good. Party town. Okay. Okay.

01:36:51
<transcript>: With the admin of AI within the past months, do you see staff use improving or now in jeopardy.

01:36:51
<transcript>: great question

01:36:52
amberdev: EA Games launches Battlefield... :D

01:36:53
<transcript>: Great question. Okufa.

01:36:55
<transcript>: So.

01:37:01
nexxeln: partytown is great but why tf is it called partytown LUL

01:37:02
<transcript>: Lots of layers to this answer.

01:37:02
<transcript>: one

01:37:04
<transcript>: One.

01:37:04
<transcript>: i

01:37:09
stiefbroerikzitvast: pretty sure the illustration could be done with AI

01:37:12
nexxeln: builder.io has the worst names for their libraries

01:37:17
<transcript>: I think it does seem like any of these approaches with these llms and the broader, like generating AI movement doesn't seem like any of them are infringing on what that means as well.

01:37:17
<transcript>: which is like

01:37:19
<transcript>: Which is like very precise answers.

01:37:21
<transcript>: And a lot of supplementary data.

01:37:21
<transcript>: for those

01:37:23
mhuggins7278: @nexxeln lol

01:37:26
bmwfan300: yup i whan make car game SeemsGood

01:37:29
<transcript>: For those questions, I don't think I'm worried about AI doing that wholesale and just being able to, like, copy what status is today.

01:37:34
<transcript>: But we definitely want to try and figure out a way to leverage it. So we saw somebody on Twitter.

01:37:34
<transcript>: use

01:37:34
amberdev: Why?

01:37:49
<transcript>: Use lang chain and they use chat gbt or something or just open a eyes models of some sort plus stat muse and they use Status as a Q amp A engine, but they like wrap the answer with chat gpt or something.

01:37:49
<transcript>: it was

01:37:52
<transcript>: It was interesting. It's like a richer.

01:37:52
<transcript>: answer than

01:37:57
<transcript>: Answer than what we provide by just using these giant models.

01:37:57
<transcript>: to layer

01:37:59
<transcript>: To layer in additional context and stuff.

01:37:59
<transcript>: that

01:38:07
<transcript>: That's interesting to me, and we'll definitely explore it. But the main thing I think that we're thinking about when it comes to this AI stuff is.

01:38:07
<transcript>: how much

01:38:10
<transcript>: How much of it's going to replace.

01:38:10
<transcript>: like

01:38:14
<transcript>: Like people say Google's dead like Chad gbt is gonna kill Google.

01:38:28
<transcript>: I think that's hyperbole, but we have to think about, like most of our traffic at statues comes from Google. We do millions of unique page visits from Google, like Organic inbound search results from Google.

01:38:28
<transcript>: every month

01:38:38
<transcript>: Every month. And if that started changing and new AI tools, even the Google creates new tools coming out that replace the traditional.

01:38:38
<transcript>: search engine

01:38:42
<transcript>: Search engine model. We have to think about that because that's.

01:38:42
<transcript>: a large

01:38:44
<transcript>: A large part of our traffic.

01:38:44
<transcript>: and ultimately

01:38:49
<transcript>: And ultimately, if we're selling things to people who come to our site like a subscription.

01:38:58
<transcript>: That's affecting our top of the funnel if search engine stuff changes fundamentally. So if AI starts answering everybody's questions and people don't go to Google anymore.

01:39:04
<transcript>: Are we set up to live and thrive in that world as well. One example.

01:39:10
amberdev: --- I think some sort of big thing will be "credibility engine". Like... every author will need to have some credibility in the future WEB.

01:39:11
<transcript>: I'm forgetting the name of it's like an AI search engine perplexity. So if you look up.

01:39:11
<transcript>: perplex

01:39:13
<transcript>: Perplexity AI.

01:39:13
<transcript>: here

01:39:14
adamdotdev: https://www.perplexity.ai/

01:39:14
<transcript>: Here.

01:39:24
<transcript>: They're like a kind of AI search engine. And if you ask, like who has the most touchdown passes in season.

01:39:29
<transcript>: You ask questions on perpetrate samus.

01:39:29
<transcript>: yes

01:39:32
adamdotdev: https://www.perplexity.ai/?s=u&uuid=89d8bb6b-9cbe-48c6-b0c1-85a61efc44ff

01:39:40
<transcript>: Yes. Okay. So here's a question. I'm going to paste right here in the chat. I could have just shared my screen, but I'm not. I'm gonna do this. So you can see like they're referencing data they got from statmes.

01:39:44
<transcript>: So this is encouraging. It's like a search engine. That.

01:39:44
<transcript>: is based on

01:39:49
<transcript>: Is based on AI, but it's also using statmes, just like Google does.

01:39:56
<transcript>: Anyway, that feels good. Feels like maybe we're not too far off and that will exist in the new world.

01:39:56
<transcript>: but we

01:39:59
<transcript>: But we gotta stay on top of that stuff, obviously.

01:40:05
<transcript>: Has the worst names for their libraries.

01:40:12
<transcript>: Oh, that's a builder io thing. Party town is interesting.

01:40:18
<transcript>: Ea Games Launches battlefield battlefield was so buggy. I remember playing that in College.

01:40:18
<transcript>: pretty sure the

01:40:38
<transcript>: Pretty sure the illustration could be done with AI. So the great point step ro, we've talked with Wall chalk about like trying to figure out if we can use style transfer to generate just basically make it where he can make more illustrations in a day by using style transfer in these AI tools and then maybe he's touching them up. The main problem with that Sepro is those are all rasterized graphics.

01:40:47
<transcript>: Rasterides. I sound like such a hillbilly. When I say that word, they're all Rashed or eyes. They're not vector graphics. So because.

01:40:47
<transcript>: they're

01:40:49
<transcript>: They're raster. Is it rost.

01:40:49
<transcript>: rostor

01:40:51
okufa_f: the southern drawl

01:40:53
<transcript>: Rostor the raster graphics. They're like pixels.

01:40:53
<transcript>: it generates

01:40:57
okufa_f: mahomes has it

01:41:03
<transcript>: It generates pixels. It doesn't generate vector data, like he makes all the illustrations in illustrator, and like with pads and all that. Right. It's like an svg.

01:41:11
<transcript>: Maybe AI is doing that, too now, but I haven't seen a style transfer tool that works with vector data.

01:41:13
<transcript>: If that makes sense.

01:41:17
okufa_f: did you have a superbowl viewing party?

01:41:20
<transcript>: So that's the only reason we haven't, like gone hard down that path of like we can make every player with our style.

01:41:20
<transcript>: we will

01:41:21
stiefbroerikzitvast: well than make them png's

01:41:34
<transcript>: We will eventually, I'm sure. But I think some sort of big thing will be credibility engine. Like every author will need to have some credibility in the future web. I think you're right, Amber. I think that's still what Google cares about. Like is this document credible.

01:41:34
<transcript>: and i

01:41:39
<transcript>: And I think the new AI world, if it changes things fundamentally.

01:41:39
<transcript>: would be

01:41:42
<transcript>: Would be served, would be doing.

01:41:42
<transcript>: good

01:41:47
<transcript>: Good to preserve that think that's help sift through the internet.

01:41:47
<transcript>: the southern

01:41:56
<transcript>: The Southern dramas has it. Did you have a Super Bowl viewing party? I did not a koofa. I watched it in my bedroom alone because my wife said about sports.

01:41:56
<transcript>: and she had

01:42:02
<transcript>: And she had tucked boys in because I was watching. I normally took my boys in like I I'm the one that does the nighttime routine.

01:42:02
<transcript>: she's with them

01:42:13
<transcript>: She's with them in the morning, when they wake up, I'm the one that, like, tucks them in. And that was the night I did not check them in because I watched the Super Bowl, and I felt really bad, like, I'm a terrible father. But there you go.

01:42:13
<transcript>: i watched it alone

01:42:15
<transcript>: I watched it alone.

01:42:15
<transcript>: make them

01:42:26
<transcript>: Make them pngs. We they end up as png. So we do like on the site. They're all just pngs. But it's nice having the source vectors that we can scale to any size.

01:42:28
<transcript>: I don't know.

01:42:35
<transcript>: We'll get there eventually. I'm sure AI will enhance while chalk's ability to make player illustrations.

01:42:41
<transcript>: All right. What do you say we actually do some work.

01:42:41
<transcript>: all right

01:42:43
<transcript>: All Right, fine.

01:42:43
<transcript>: final

01:42:45
<transcript>: Final do some work.

01:42:45
<transcript>: turn

01:42:46
okufa_f: if statmuse were to ever expand, i feel like fantasy sports might be right around the corner

01:42:48
<transcript>: Turn on my pomodoro timer. In my thing. That word. Right.

01:42:51
<transcript>: Pomoduro.

01:42:51
<transcript>: if that means

01:42:56
<transcript>: If that means word to ever expand, I feel like fantasy sports might be right around the corner.

01:42:56
<transcript>: akuva

01:43:01
<transcript>: Akuva we actually did quite a lot for fantasy sports. We.

01:43:01
<transcript>: once made

01:43:02
<transcript>: Once made.

01:43:02
<transcript>: an alex

01:43:07
stiefbroerikzitvast: hire slow, fire fast. Walchok you've been replaced by AI

01:43:16
<transcript>: An alexa skill with Matthew Barry, where we recorded him in a studio for a few hours. And we, like created a voice copy of his. And we would answer any fantasy football questions on alexa with Matthew berry's voice.

01:43:16
<transcript>: you come on and

01:43:21
<transcript>: You come on and be like, you should definitely draft. What's his name? Because he's awesome or whatever. I don't remember.

01:43:21
<transcript>: so

01:43:28
<transcript>: So we built like a whole skill that was just geared around fantasy football. And we used Matthew Berry. That's the talent.

01:43:33
<transcript>: And I think we've even have a fantasy section on Samus.com. I don't know how great it is, but.

01:43:47
<transcript>: Fantasy football players definitely use that muse. We just don't have a lot of, like, formal, like handholdie tools around it. Higher, slow firefast, wall talk. You've been replaced by Aya AI step. Rob, that's awful.

01:43:55
<transcript>: I don't think that would be firing fast. Waltugux been there for eight years. So that'd be a pretty slow five firing.

01:43:55
<transcript>: we're not gonna fire a while

01:44:00
<transcript>: We're not gonna fire a while talk. I'll talk to the best. Okay, I'm going back.

01:44:00
<transcript>: i'm gonna actually

01:44:02
<transcript>: I'm gonna actually do some work.

01:44:02
<transcript>: actually

01:44:03
<transcript>: Actually.

01:44:14
okufa_f: statmuse illustartions are a staple

01:44:14
<transcript>: Do some work. Okay. So this is not what I want. I want this. We're gonna we're gonna make this thing work. Oh, yeah. I was getting the data.

01:44:16
<transcript>: Here's the day.

01:44:24
<transcript>: I think it's the same shape as the other thing.

01:44:24
<transcript>: okay

01:44:27
<transcript>: Okay. So I need to let's see.

01:44:27
<transcript>: oh

01:44:35
<transcript>: Oh, play the player and game ids. That's what I was. That's why I took a break. I hit something hard, and I was like, yeah, you can just take a break.

01:44:38
<transcript>: Parse.

01:44:41
<transcript>: Game. I'm just gonna try that. No.

01:44:43
<transcript>: I don't remember.

01:44:47
<transcript>: The casing style.

01:44:49
<transcript>: In elixir.

01:44:53
<transcript>: Parse.

01:44:56
<transcript>: Game.

01:44:56
<transcript>: id

01:44:59
<transcript>: Id. Here we go.

01:44:59
<transcript>: feel good party

01:45:08
<transcript>: Feel good. Party. Look at me. I don't know why github search didn't find that because obviously, but. Okay, cool. We did it.

01:45:10
grasp5533: Got to go to a meeting.  Have fun

01:45:13
nexxeln: oh wow beautiful elixir code

01:45:18
<transcript>: So I think I have like, a let's see, where was parse player ID. Oh, I have like a lib. Parse feels kind of dumb, but I guess I was just trying to mirror.

01:45:27
<transcript>: Kind of mirror the game or the I already have game ID in here. Look at me. Look at that. I'm thinking ahead. Look at me.

01:45:27
<transcript>: beautiful

01:45:29
<transcript>: Beautiful elixir. Code. Sorry.

01:45:29
<transcript>: i'm

01:45:32
<transcript>: I'm replacing all the electric code with JavaScript.

01:45:32
<transcript>: you're welcome

01:45:33
<transcript>: You're welcome.

01:45:37
<transcript>: See a graph. Have fun.

01:45:40
amberdev: Who wrote that!?

01:45:41
amberdev: :D

01:45:42
nexxeln: so lame LUL

01:45:49
okufa_f: are you fluent in elixir/phoenix?

01:46:08
<transcript>: Are you fluent in elixir? Phoenix? You know, I used to be. I used to write a lot of elixir. Back when I worked at Sat me's the first time.

01:46:08
<transcript>: these

01:46:12
<transcript>: These days I don't do a lot of elixir.

01:46:12
<transcript>: i mean the only

01:46:16
<transcript>: I mean, the only elixir I do is reading elixir.

01:46:16
<transcript>: to convert

01:46:18
<transcript>: To convert the site from a liquid.

01:46:24
<transcript>: So. No, I'm not fluent anymore. I just haven't used it for years.

01:46:24
<transcript>: okay so if

01:46:28
<transcript>: Okay, so if this is right, let me parse game ID should already be a thing.

01:46:32
binajmen: I was going to ask if Elixir was a good experience. Apparently not enough to keep you in their world

01:46:35
<transcript>: And we're gonna do parse, game, ID.

01:46:41
<transcript>: We are not gonna pass player in there though what am I doing here? Get game.

01:46:42
amberdev: It's like me when i discover that i have some weird repository i was working on long time ago.

01:46:43
<transcript>: Params.

01:46:46
<transcript>: Player, it's game.

01:46:59
<transcript>: I was going to ask if elixir was a good experience. Apparently not enough to keep you in the world. No. Elixir's. Great.

01:47:05
<transcript>: And one could argue that this site would be just as good written in elixir, Phoenix.

01:47:05
<transcript>: all server

01:47:08
<transcript>: All server rendered the main reason.

01:47:20
<transcript>: So the stamus app, as it exists today, is partially server rendered with elixir Phoenix, but then it's also a react app like in the body of the page.

01:47:20
<transcript>: for like all

01:47:22
sockthedev: copilot is great for understanding regexes like this, i do a code comment below a regex i want more insight into; // The above regex matches the following examples; And then let copilot fill in a bunch of example matches.

01:47:28
<transcript>: For like all the visuals, and I wanted to rid the thing of that. I don't want it to be separately, server rendered in client rendered. It was just a mess.

01:47:28
<transcript>: and

01:47:31
<transcript>: And you could argue.

01:47:31
<transcript>: it'd be easier

01:47:46
<transcript>: It'd be easier, lower hanging fruit to just get rid of all the react and replace it with server rendering from elixir in Phoenix. The main reason we're switching over to something different is I'm gonna be building a lot of new features at a status calm. We have really built new features on setmes.com for years.

01:47:46
<transcript>: and

01:47:48
<transcript>: And.

01:47:48
<transcript>: it's just

01:47:52
<transcript>: It's just easier to find people that know how to use javascript than it is to find.

01:47:52
<transcript>: people

01:47:56
<transcript>: People who are really good with elixir. That's it.

01:47:56
<transcript>: like

01:47:57
<transcript>: Like.

01:47:57
<transcript>: we're moving to

01:48:00
amberdev: I need to learn those damn regexes.

01:48:06
<transcript>: We're moving to astro mostly because I know anybody that knows javascript. I can plug in and say, hey, we need to build this out on the site. And it's pretty simple.

01:48:06
<transcript>: to get your head around

01:48:08
<transcript>: To get your head around.

01:48:12
binajmen: Fair enough :)

01:48:14
<transcript>: It's like me when I discover that I had some weird repositories working a long time ago. Yeah.

01:48:14
<transcript>: capella is great

01:48:17
amberdev: I am postponing that for year.

01:48:25
<transcript>: Capella is great for understanding regex's like this. I do a code comment below a regex. I want it more inside. Oh, interesting. The above regex matches the phone examples. Oh, that's a great idea.

01:48:30
<transcript>: I want to know what that redex does. Let's see.

01:48:37
<transcript>: And then it should generate stuff.

01:48:40
<transcript>: Come on, copilot gimme.

01:48:46
<transcript>: My copilot might not be working sometimes I think it's working sometimes I don't think it's working.

01:48:51
sockthedev: open the comment

01:48:52
<transcript>: Oh, Amber.

01:48:52
<transcript>: delay regex

01:48:53
amberdev: Lazy co-pilot

01:48:56
<transcript>: Delay regex is as long as you possibly can open the comment.

01:49:01
<transcript>: Open the comment. What do you mean.

01:49:04
trivenge: wait, delay regex, why? LUL

01:49:09
sockthedev: on the new line

01:49:13
<transcript>: Delay regex lazy code. Yeah, it's not doing anything. And I don't know if it's my fault.

01:49:14
sockthedev: start the //

01:56:14
<transcript>: double overtime

01:56:14
sockthedev: adam, you should run a charity stream where we get to vote on the year and associated tech you need to complete a task. code like it's 2002 vibes.

01:56:16
<transcript>: Double overtime. Look at this.

01:56:17
okufa_f: it is

01:56:30
<transcript>: Adam, you should run a cherry stream. I perked up when where we get to vote on the year and associate tech, you need to complete a task code like it's 2002 vibes. I love that ooh, that reminds me.

01:56:34
<transcript>: That reminds me.

01:56:34
<transcript>: i have this idea

01:56:35
<transcript>: I have this idea.

01:56:35
<transcript>: and

01:56:39
<transcript>: And I think I told Latin about it. I want to build it.

01:56:39
<transcript>: i'm gonna build

01:56:42
<transcript>: I'm gonna build my first new event. Plugin.

01:56:44
<transcript>: And the plugin.

01:56:44
<transcript>: is going

01:56:47
<transcript>: Is going to not let you.

01:56:47
<transcript>: delete

01:56:50
<transcript>: Delete anything from a buffer. A buffer.

01:56:50
<transcript>: so if i were

01:56:53
<transcript>: So if I were working on can only grow.

01:56:56
<transcript>: I haven't come up with a name yet but.

01:56:56
<transcript>: it can only

01:57:01
<transcript>: It can only get bigger. If you put something into the buffer, you cannot remove it.

01:57:03
aj_stuyvenberg: blockchainbuffer

01:57:06
<transcript>: You can't undo you can't do any deleting. So this plugins gonna basically make it where.

01:57:18
<transcript>: The the buffer either grows or you delete it, and you start over, and I'm gonna see like, can I build an app where I can't believe a single character? So if I accidentally add a character, you gotta just make it work.

01:57:18
<transcript>: i

01:57:24
sockthedev: blackholebuffer

01:57:25
<transcript>: I added an open bracket. Mama, figure out how to close that bracket. That kind of thing. What do we think? Does that sounds fun.

01:57:25
<transcript>: it'll

01:57:26
amberdev: You just lost 1 user. :D

01:57:29
<transcript>: It'll be a nightmare. Like it'll be awful.

01:57:29
<transcript>: this

01:57:32
<transcript>: This lost one user. What did I miss.

01:57:34
<transcript>: Blockchain buffer.

01:57:34
<transcript>: thanks so much for the

01:57:36
<transcript>: Thanks so much for the follow crim.

01:57:36
<transcript>: crimo

01:57:37

thdxr: AppendOnlyHell

01:57:45
<transcript>: Black hole buffer. Is that already a thing? Blockchain buffer.

01:57:46
sockthedev: sounds aweful

01:57:49
<transcript>: I think that would be Hell. That's the idea. Tarofulis. Also, welcome to chat.

01:57:49
<transcript>: append

01:57:52
<transcript>: Appendonly Hill. Sounds awful.

01:57:52
<transcript>: yeah no

01:57:57
<transcript>: Yeah. No, I think it would be fun to watch, though, right. Thank you, antoine, for the follow.

01:57:57
<transcript>: would that not be fun

01:58:00
<transcript>: Would that not be fun to watch? I feel like.

01:58:00
<transcript>: it would be

01:58:05
<transcript>: It would be awful as an experience as a developer to be actually working on the thing.

01:58:05
<transcript>: but i

01:58:11
<transcript>: But I feel like it could be really entertaining because you'll be watching if you're a sadist, if you enjoy watching people squirm.

01:58:11
<transcript>: and go through

01:58:14
<transcript>: And go through awful experiences, right.

01:58:20
amberdev: Like... 100% accuracy

01:58:20
<transcript>: And then I thought.

01:58:20
<transcript>: you

01:58:22
<transcript>: You can make like a speed competition.

01:58:22
<transcript>: like

01:58:23
<transcript>: Like.

01:58:23
<transcript>: two people

01:58:31
sockthedev: totally

01:58:36
<transcript>: Two people trying to do at same time, I don't know. My mind went all kinds of places, 100% accuracy. Or it's either 100% accuracy. Or you get really good at figuring out if you actually put a character in how can you make that character go away.

01:58:36
<transcript>: you know i'm saying

01:58:38
<transcript>: You know, I'm saying like.

01:58:38
<transcript>: i guess

01:58:47
<transcript>: I guess there's some characters you just you can't if you like if you start an if statement in JavaScript and you do your open bracket and then you type like.

01:58:47
<transcript>: i don't know

01:58:49
<transcript>: I don't know.

01:58:52
<transcript>: What would be a character you can't recover from.

01:58:57
<transcript>: Like a number or something.

01:58:59
<transcript>: You can do.

01:59:00
amberdev: .... self-healing source code

01:59:03
th3_l3m0n: just comment out the line and rewrite the line

01:59:06
<transcript>: Yeah. I guess that would happen a lot. And then you just have to delete. You said to delete the buffer and start over.

01:59:11
<transcript>: Comment out the line. Well, you can't comment at the line unless.

01:59:14
<transcript>: Like how would you do that behind.

01:59:14
<transcript>: oh you can

01:59:25
<transcript>: Oh, you can go back. Oh, you can add things to the buffer. So, yeah, you. Oh, no lemon. Oh, no. This idea is no good cuz. It's easy to get around. You could just comment out anytime.

01:59:25
<transcript>: is that right

01:59:27
<transcript>: Is that right.

01:59:33
<transcript>: Okay. So maybe it's not as not as exciting.

01:59:35
<transcript>: I think you could still be fun.

01:59:35
<transcript>: it's still annoying

01:59:41
<transcript>: It's still annoying if you had to keep commenting stuff. Am I? How would you format? I don't know. It would just be kind of fun.

01:59:41
<transcript>: i'm

01:59:42
krimo47: or imagine like a "hide away your writing" while you're coding, every few words or line jump the words you wrote disappears

01:59:44
<transcript>: I'm gonna try it, we'll see.

01:59:46
th3_l3m0n: remove the ability to comment in your plugin xD

01:59:53
<transcript>: Kram. Welcome to Chat. Imagine like a hideaway your riding while you're coding every few words or lines, jump the words you wrote disappears. Ooh.

01:59:53
<transcript>: do you guys

01:59:56
<transcript>: Do you guys hear my kids running.

02:00:00
<transcript>: See? I did. I'm. I like that you're on my wavelength here, krim. Because.

02:00:00
<transcript>: i just started

02:00:05
<transcript>: I just started thinking through, what are some awful things that would be terrible. As a developer.

02:00:05
<transcript>: to

02:00:06
<transcript>: To deal with.

02:00:06
<transcript>: and then

02:00:11
<transcript>: And then make like games out of it. Remove the ability to comment in your own plugin.

02:00:14
<transcript>: So no.

02:00:14
<transcript>: removing from

02:00:17
<transcript>: Removing from the buffer or commenting.

02:00:28
<transcript>: That would be painful. Then I don't know. I feel like you just have to keep deleting the buffer because you'd inevitably make mistakes. The number of times I hit a character, I don't mean to hit.

02:00:28
<transcript>: is like

02:00:32
<transcript>: Is like I think that rate is like 5%.

02:00:32
<transcript>: maybe more

02:00:33
<transcript>: Maybe more.

02:00:41
<transcript>: I've still not finished my breakfast.

02:00:41
<transcript>: turns out

02:00:42
<transcript>: Turns out when I'm streaming.

02:00:47
<transcript>: Not the best multitaskr.

02:00:47
<transcript>: i've not eaten my brother

02:00:48
<transcript>: I've not eaten. My brother.

02:00:48
<transcript>: there's

02:00:51
<transcript>: There's no way. I mean a lot bar if I still haven't eaten my breakfast.

02:00:51
<transcript>: so

02:00:54
<transcript>: So I'm a little bummed.

02:00:54
<transcript>: these

02:01:00
<transcript>: These are all clientside. They don't change the url at all. I can make them change the url, I guess.

02:01:02
maleero: Reminds me of hardcore games with permadeath LUL

02:01:03
<transcript>: I just don't want to build this. It's like.

02:01:03
<transcript>: a

02:01:05
<transcript>: A client side generated thing.

dr_dinomight: Every time you have to add a comment, you have to pay the "Toll" and it adds a ; somewhere else in the code unknown to you :P

02:01:11
amberdev: on typing tests i have average 96% accuracy. :(

02:01:11
<transcript>: I'll want the data all to be existing serverside on a page.

02:01:18
<transcript>: Permadef OOH maliro? What is permadeath.

02:01:18
<transcript>: every time you have

02:01:30
okufa_f: would you lose the animation of the deep blue nav bar if you were to make it separate page?

02:01:30
livemahs: Do you guys have a mobile app?

02:01:31
<transcript>: Somewhere else in the code unknown to you. That sounds awesome. Okay, we created a dev torture Chamber. I'm here for it.

02:01:35
<transcript>: Who Amber 96% Accuracy. Sounds good.

02:01:39
<transcript>: But yeah, that 4% will get you in that plugin.

02:01:57
<transcript>: Would you lose the animation of The Deep Blue navbar if you were to make it separate page.

02:02:00
<transcript>: Is there animation.

02:02:06
maleero: Some games have it so when you die, the character on all items on it are deleted. Kind of like deleting the buffer

02:02:06
<transcript>: Oh, this little bar here. Yeah, I don't care. I just literally don't care.

02:02:10
<transcript>: Sorry. I know. I'm not trying to dismiss.

02:02:14
<transcript>: I think a koopa that just tries triggered something in me that it's like.

02:02:33
nexxeln: fr

02:02:34
<transcript>: Like I feel like we make a really big deal about the benefits of spas being page transitions.

02:02:47
<transcript>: Do you guys have a mobile app? Yes. There's a status. Iphone app only on iOS. We do not have an Android app. It's been in the To Do column for years.

02:02:56
<transcript>: Some games have it. So when you die, the character on all or all items are deleted. Kind of like deleting the buffer oof permanent. I gotcha.

02:02:56
<transcript>: i

<transcript>: I got you.

02:03:05
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, we have this little thing on stat muse.

<transcript>: are you using

02:03:25
<transcript>: Are you using sports data? I. O. For your data. No.

02:03:32
<transcript>: I think we are using sport radar for a long time for new like live data.

02:03:32
<transcript>: i don't know

02:03:34
<transcript>: I don't know if that's still the case.

02:03:41
<transcript>: I'm just building the website. I'm kind of checked out of a lot of the details. I was gone for three years.

02:03:41
<transcript>: so

02:03:42
<transcript>: So.

02:03:42
<transcript>: since i came back

02:03:47
<transcript>: Since I came back, I've only been doing this rewrite and I've not really dug into.

02:03:47
<transcript>: what else is going

02:03:52
krimo47: every time you use delete a random token from intellisence plugin get deleted and you don't know which one

02:03:54
<transcript>: What else is going on at Samues? And I'm just kind of like, in a hole until I get this whole site rewritten.

02:03:56
<transcript>: I'm just pretty focused on that.

02:04:02
<transcript>: Every time you use delete a random token from Intelligence plugin get deleted.

02:04:02
<transcript>: and you don't

02:04:03

02:04:15
okufa_f: honestly astro seems like a great choice for statmuse

02:04:20
<transcript>: Are they from Minneapolis? That sounds familiar. I thought the one we worked with was like a European thing, though.

02:04:23
amberdev: Better... new plugin is added.

02:04:23
aj_stuyvenberg: sportradar

trivenge: even better? the work you are doing must be something mrbeast related

02:10:07
trivenge: go viral

02:10:08
<transcript>: So I just passed the game. No, I bet it's an object.

02:10:46
<transcript>: I'm just kidding. I think I say data.

02:10:53
<transcript>: Sport radar Astro should do a case study. Hey, dax, they are gonna do a case study. I think.

02:10:53
trivenge: i believe it is an old wooden ship

02:11:01
<transcript>: On status? Yep. Astra should. That's a good quote. Are you using Astro syntax to build a site or still using React? It is Astro.

02:11:15
<transcript>: Hey there, Oscar. Sorry, Mr. Hatey. I thought that was the first I'd seen you chat. That tailwind thing hurts so much I will never use it. What is tailwind? What? I mean, what? I know what tailwind is. What is the tailwind thing? Hydrate. Okay, here we go.

02:11:23
<transcript>: I just think the last of my liquid. So please don't hydrate again. It will be wasted.

02:11:31
<transcript>: So let me call me bloated. What just happened? Oh, tailwind is bloated. You think tailwind's blood.

02:11:40
<transcript>: People who pronounce it as detach, our questionable people, uhoh, or did it. Is that data.

<transcript>: What proportion of earth's population use English.

02:11:45
sockthedev: it was one of grid containers, with the [] customisations

02:11:49
aj_stuyvenberg: datum > *

02:12:04
<transcript>: Which one English YouTube video? Ooh triv I programmed for 48 hours with a Twist must program and work for the full 848 hours. Besides bathroom breaks, food is eaten while working. No rest breaks, but the Twist you built some plugin that deletes a random function or variable from your js code. If you insert something that you do here, OOH, I love it.

02:12:04
<transcript>: how do you fit that

02:12:06
okufa_f: tailwind was beloved up until twitter went up in arms about it about a month ago

02:12:14
<transcript>: How do you fit that into a title triv? Even better. The work you're doing must be something Mr. Beastrelated go viral. Yeah. So we can use Mr. Beast in the thumbnail. I'm with you. I'm with you.

02:12:14
lilfreezi: it would be spelled datta if the WRONG pronunciation were the correct way to say it

02:12:18
<transcript>: I believe it is an old wooden ship.

02:12:28
<transcript>: I'm still catching up. Tailwind is the opposite of loaded. Agreed.

02:12:28
<transcript>: datum

02:12:29
<transcript>: Datum.

02:12:30
sockthedev: gotta say, i fought against using tailwind for ages. tried literally everything else. loving tailwind now. force yourself to use it for one project at least.

02:12:33
<transcript>: Is that like Jason Tatum.

02:12:36
<transcript>: It would be spelled.

02:12:36
<transcript>: data

02:12:45
<transcript>: Data if the wrong foundation or the correct way to say it gotta say I fought against using tailored for ages tried literally everything else loving tailwind? I love tailwind? I also love tail end.

02:12:47
<transcript>: Okay.

02:12:49
oskrm: "I Coded Nonstop for 48 Hours and This Happened‚Ä¶ (You Won‚Äôt Believe the Twist!) "

<transcript>: I really hate it.

02:12:59
nexxeln: but now i just use uno and can't go back to tailwind

<transcript>: So we get the data. And then we pass the data.

02:13:00
amberdev: LOL

02:13:00

02:13:09
<transcript>: Well, now, wait a minute.

02:13:14
<transcript>: This is this in the game layout? Didn't I add this to the game layout.

02:13:16
<transcript>: What is all this stuff.

02:13:18
<transcript>: Good add here.

02:13:28
<transcript>: Just get out of here. I don't care about any of that stuff. I just want to see the header.

02:13:28
<transcript>: that's all i'm asking

02:13:32
sockthedev: Mr Vercel had a good take on tailwind today on twitter

02:13:33
<transcript>: That's all I'm asking for. Just a header on a render. It did it.

02:13:33
snowfoundry: What is the general method of using Astro to validate form inputs?

02:13:47
<transcript>: I cannot work the rest of the day. You see what I just got done? Look at that. Okay. So it's not quite right. That guy's floating. He should not be floating. You should sit right there so as to keep the illusion.

02:13:47
<transcript>: that

02:13:47
nexxeln: adam is so excited LUL

02:13:50

02:13:57
<transcript>: Nailed it. First try. Let's find some more games. So we'll go to the nyx.

02:14:03
sockthedev: interested to see how astro handles form posts

02:14:04
<transcript>: And we'll click on this random game against the Net. Nick's and Nets. Couple of New York teams.

02:14:08
<transcript>: Face it off. We'll see how it renders.

02:14:12
trivenge: I built a Mrbeast program in 48 hours with Javascript

02:14:12
daglee: datum is the strict singular form of data. It's common for variables to be named datum in lisp code. :)

02:14:15
trivenge: something along those lines

02:14:17
okufa_f: the knicks are a good team finally

02:14:27
<transcript>: Renders great. I mean, different players. No, something's wrong. There's still something wrong with the alignment. There's probably just like an extra Div or something I did here, dumb. But look at that. Does these even work? Oh, do these work? Did I get the links already? I got the links working.

02:14:27
<transcript>: wow

02:14:29

02:14:49
nexxeln: adam add gigachad emote

02:14:56
<transcript>: Astro to validate form inputs. You know I haven't done.

02:14:56
<transcript>: any of them yet

02:14:57
<transcript>: Any of them yet.

02:14:57
<transcript>: there's really

02:15:02
<transcript>: There's really unsatmese. There's like one there's one form input it's the search bar.

02:15:02
<transcript>: when you

02:15:02
trivenge: doesnt have to be exact. in the intro? hit them with a hook, fast paced, maybe a snippet of you groaning about this plugin that you built that could produce a lot of suffering lol. just trying to give ideas. lol

02:15:04
<transcript>: When you enter a query and you hit enter.

02:15:04
<transcript>: we're gonna

02:15:07
<transcript>: We're gonna do a form, like a post or whatever.

02:15:07
<transcript>: i just

02:15:21
<transcript>: I just haven't done it yet. I've saved it. I've just been doing, like giving url render identical markup using astro. That's what I've been doing for a long time now because there's a lot of pages on Sat music, a lot of different types of pages.

02:15:21
<transcript>: but

02:15:30
<transcript>: But I haven't gotten to the part where I actually, like, submit new queries, so I need to do that. So I'll let you know you'll find out. Just stick around. Welcome to chat.

02:15:36
snowfoundry: Thanks!

02:15:36
<transcript>: Hey, how tailwind is such a hot topic? You use it if it fits the project or don't that's it.

02:15:43
<transcript>: Oh, I coded nonstop for 48 hours and this happened. You won't believe the twist. I love it.

02:15:50
maleero: StatMuse sounds like a dream to work on! One form?!

02:15:54
<transcript>: Okay, so we just saw on my next YouTube video. Thank you, everybody. I appreciate it. I am so excited. I am so excited because I got a thing done while streaming. Still got it.

<transcript>: Interesting to see how astro handles form posts. Me too. I'll let you guys know you'll see if you come back tomorrow or the next day or the next door the next day because I'm the stream every day this week.

02:16:14
<transcript>: Datum is the strict singular form of data. It's common for variables to be named Datum and list code. Interesting.

02:16:23
<transcript>: I've never written list code. That maybe why I didn't know that something along those lines, nick's, are a good team. Finally. Are they really the mixer? Good.

02:16:23
<transcript>: what

02:16:24
<transcript>: What.

<transcript>: What is the Giga chat emote? Is that just the guy that's really muscular? Doesn't have to be exact. In the intro. Hit them with the hook, fast pace, maybe a snippet of you groaning about this plugin that you build.

02:16:36
<transcript>: i

02:16:47
<transcript>: I can see the video. I really, I can see it. Sammy. Sounds like a dream to work on one form. Exactly. Okay, no joke. Malaro. This is no joke. I love.

02:16:56
<transcript>: To build projects based on how little ui is involved. So statues was very attractive to me because I knew it was one input, one search box.

02:16:56
<transcript>: and then just

02:17:04
<transcript>: And then just like render stuff. I hate forms so much that I won't build a thing if it involves lots of forms.

02:17:04
<transcript>: like all

02:17:18
<transcript>: Like all my side projects, they lack forms. You'll notice that if you see anything I build like I want to build rebase TV with dax. Tell me how many forms are involved in rebased TV. There's no forms. Zero forms.

02:17:18
<transcript>: like i

02:17:21
<transcript>: Like I build stuff.

02:17:23
<transcript>: That's my main criteria.

02:17:23
<transcript>: i

02:17:27
amberdev: ERP SaaS is not an Adam's thing.

02:17:29
aj_stuyvenberg: "why would I ever ask the user to provide information? I know what people want to see, not them!"

02:17:33
<transcript>: I mostly choose side projects based on Can I not use like form elements in html? Can I build this whole side project and not have to build a form.

02:17:36
<transcript>: It's it it's that simple.

02:17:40
<transcript>: Erp. Sas is not an atom thing, exactly.

02:17:41
trivenge: as in, its easier to not force the user to have input via forms? to make things simple?

02:17:47
<transcript>: Why would I ever ask? Do you should provide information? I know what people want to see exactly. I know better users don't know.

02:17:53
<transcript>: Ausni. Neto. Thank you for the follow. And antoine, did I see that one.

02:17:53
<transcript>: i think i saw

02:17:55
<transcript>: I think I saw your follow.

02:17:55
<transcript>: i should

02:18:00
iamdavidhill: More UI please üòÑ

02:18:08
<transcript>: I should this week, at some point have follows, showing back up on screen. I'm sorry that they don't feel like you guys got robbed. You follow me? You think like, oh, I bet I'll see my name pop up on the screen and then it doesn't. And that's a bummer. It should.

02:18:17
<transcript>: Let's see. Why would I ever ask? No. It's easier to not force user to have input via forms to make things simple. Wait.

02:18:21
<transcript>: It's easier to not force a user to have input via forms.

02:18:28
oskrm: Follows is made possible by forms.

02:18:31
<transcript>: Yeah, no, it's just easier to build projects that don't have forms. I just hate html forms. Like I hate inputs, form validation. Hang on one SEC.

02:18:36
<transcript>: Are you just laughing at me.

02:18:48
<transcript>: You're laughing at me. You are my wife came in here because our printer is in my office closet. And she was laughing at me because I'm dumb when I scream and she knows me and.

02:18:48
<transcript>: that was unclear

02:18:49
<transcript>: That was unclear.

02:18:50
trivenge: LUL

02:18:57
<transcript>: More ui, please. Yeah. I just don't like forms. I don't like validating that you've put in the right thing, and then like error messages.

02:18:57
<transcript>: just all of it

02:19:02
<transcript>: Just all of it. They all in the markup performs is awful. It's also bad.

02:19:03
nexxeln: forms are a tedious process, i wish there was a trpc for forms where its all auto-validated and submitted to an endpoint

02:19:05
oskrm: yeah only "when you stream" Kappa

02:19:06
<transcript>: Follows is made possible by forms.

02:19:22
<transcript>: What's follows? Oh, oh, good point. Like on twitch. You can't follow me if there's not a form. Wait, does that mean forms are a tedious process? I wish there was a TRSPC for forms where it's all autovioletated and submitted. Yes, thank you. Next, somebody make that and then I'll build stuff that has a form.

02:19:25
schrew: built a lot of forms in my first 2 years of employment. Was not fun, wouldn't recommend

02:19:25
<transcript>: Okay.

02:19:25
<transcript>: it's getting kind of

02:19:33
<transcript>: It's getting kind of hot in here. I'm getting kind of sweaty because the studio lights. I'm not used to them. I think when I was streaming every day back then, I think I got used to it.

02:19:33
<transcript>: beyond the light

02:19:36
trivenge: i think streaming and video is a great chance to showcase the humorous and fun side of yourself. so enjoy it, because outside of that, im basically a serious logical person myself lol. i enjoy laughing though LUL

02:19:36
<transcript>: Beyond the lights. Not used to it yet.

trivenge: i gotta dip myself. have to get to work. have a good one everyone. fun stream

02:19:59
<transcript>: I'm gonna probably have to call it here pretty quick. I think streaming and video is a great chance to showcase the humorous and fun side of yourself, so enjoy it because outside of that, I'm basically a serious, logical person myself. I enjoy laughing, though. Yeah, my wife doesn't. I'm not like this. Like when we're hanging out after the kids are down. I'm not like I hate html forms, like that kind of stuff. I don't that don't say.

02:19:59
<transcript>: things like that

02:20:04
daglee: I have a form, it's called fat compared to 10 years ago.

02:20:04
<transcript>: Things like that. So when she walks in the room and here's that side of me, it's like, who is this person.

02:20:04
<transcript>: that is talking

02:20:06
<transcript>: That is talking to a camera.

02:20:12

<transcript>: and

02:20:32
oskrm: Sadge

02:20:32
<transcript>: And you know, the first one, I just need to kind of dip my toes. I should probably get a little more done today than just that header that I just built.

02:20:38
<transcript>: But I gotta say something for tomorrow you know gotta save a little win for tomorrow.

02:20:39
schrew: let's do this again sometime? in the next 6 months?

02:20:45
<transcript>: Let's see I don't know if I know how to exit stream anymore let's do this again sometime.

02:20:45
<transcript>: true i

02:20:57
<transcript>: True. I thought about that. I thought about the last time I streamed before I took, like, a three month break. I probably said, like, this was fun. Let's do this again sometime. And then I didn't come back.

02:21:04
<transcript>: This time though I'll be back. I'll be back tomorrow same time I know an hour earlier because I was late today but I'll be back tomorrow.

02:21:09
<transcript>: Working on statme Stuff. Maybe a little rebase TV. Occasionally.

02:21:13
oskrm: !time

02:21:18
<transcript>: I don't know how to end the stream, like, I literally don't know what button I hit. Oh, I think I have a button for it. Hang on, hang on, don't have a button for it. Okay.

02:21:18
<transcript>: it's been so

02:21:23
<transcript>: It's been so fun. Maybe we could do it again sometime. Let's see if I the button works. I don't know.
