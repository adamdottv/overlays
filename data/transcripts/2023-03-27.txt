vimcerf: wonder if getting up at 6AM puts you into a more productive mood.

00:10:07
tiredbeaver: i have sinned my god

00:10:17
manbravegg: @vimcerf Perhaps. Think its less about the time and more about consistency. Less sleepy leads to more productivity? Maybe there is plausible argument for the fact that if your up at 6 am and no one else you know is, you have less distractions though?

00:10:48
stroopwafel26: hello, happy monday!

00:11:00
aisebaxp: Hello from Sanya Gunt

00:11:03
aisebaxp: Hi

00:11:17
<transcript>: Good morning.

00:11:18
overra_dev: @vimcerf I prefer to be up earlier or later than others for less distractions :)

00:11:19
vimcerf: @vimcerf Consistency is probably the key here.

00:11:23
<transcript>: Those are the first words my mouth has said today. My voice, my mouth.

00:11:23
<transcript>: first

00:11:32
<transcript>: First words I said for five days because I was on vacation. No, actually, I spoke a lot on vacation, but I haven't spoken to you all.

00:11:32
<transcript>: in

00:11:34
<transcript>: In days.

00:11:34
<transcript>: literal days

dalt_kb: HeyGuys

00:11:35
<transcript>: Literal days.

00:11:38
<transcript>: It's been.

00:11:38

00:12:12
<transcript>: you

00:12:15
<transcript>: You send Tell me more.

00:12:24
overra_dev: @AiSebaXP I remember Alicante!

00:12:27
<transcript>: Man Brave is here. Perhaps think it's less about time, more about consistency, less sleepy lead, some more productivity. Maybe there is plausible argument for the fact that if you're up at 06:00 A.m. And no one else knows you are.

00:12:27
<transcript>: or

00:12:40
<transcript>: Or no one else you know is you have less distractions. 100% if I wake up a few hours before my family, that's a few hours with zero distractions. So I do that every day.

00:12:49
<transcript>: Stroop is here? An AI seba? Hello from sonya gunt. I don't know where that is. Could you tell me, please.

00:12:58
<transcript>: I am from America. And in America, we don't know much about geography, much about the world.

00:13:02
manbravegg: lol

00:13:09
<transcript>: I prefer to be up earlier or later than others for less attractions. Yeah. Later would also be, I guess, less distractions if everyone else is asleep. But I don't recommend that as much because.

00:13:12
<transcript>: There's some science.

00:13:16
mecoupz: Hey 👋

00:13:25
<transcript>: There's some new science out there. I don't know if it's new, but there's something about being in the rhythm of the sun. I don't know. Biologically. That's what our bodies sort of like, tuned into the Sun.

00:13:25
<transcript>: i don't know

00:13:29
<transcript>: I don't know. Look it up. Don't take my word for it. Dalt is here.

00:13:38
<transcript>: Dalt is here. How's your weekend? My weekend was great. Went to Kansas City. We had a little family extended weekend.

00:13:38
<transcript>: it was

00:13:41
<transcript>: It was great. It was fantastic.

00:13:43
<transcript>: No complaints.

00:13:43
<transcript>: we were talking

00:13:46
<transcript>: We were talking with our live in nanny perla.

00:13:46
<transcript>: about

00:13:52
<transcript>: About the highs and the lows from the vacation. Sorry for the Zoom. It's going to keep doing that.

00:14:02
<transcript>: What was the high point? There's really only one point. There was like a low point. It's just like we were all too hungry or something and couldn't decide on something.

00:14:02
<transcript>: that was like

00:14:06
<transcript>: That was like one afternoon. And the rest of it was fantastic.

00:14:06
<transcript>: enjoyed it

00:14:08
andom: Hi HeyGuys

00:14:09
<transcript>: Enjoyed it a whole lot. Vim surf. I missed you too.

00:14:14
<transcript>: It's been the longest break since I returned to streaming.

00:14:18
<transcript>: I'm not going to make a habit of it, although.

00:14:23
<transcript>: Next week, my streaming schedule is up in the air because my wife.

00:14:23
<transcript>: is going

00:14:28
<transcript>: Is going to a volleyball camp for a week. So it's me and the boys.

00:14:28
<transcript>: i

00:14:39
<transcript>: I'm not sure how much perla will be helping if she wants to just take a week off, or if she's going to be helping. All of that will sort of determine what my streaming schedule is.

00:14:39
<transcript>: khalid thank

00:14:42
<transcript>: Khalid, thank you for that. Follow. And Diego.

00:14:42

00:15:48

looch94: are you christian @adamdotdev ?

00:16:08
<transcript>: Nice wifey, nose wifey knows what.

00:16:12
<transcript>: Luch. Great question.

00:16:16
<transcript>: I have not gotten into my beliefs on stream.

00:16:16
<transcript>: because

00:16:27
<transcript>: Because they're complicated. I was definitely raised Christian, and my mom listens this as well. She joins the twitch Stream occasionally. I don't know about every day, but she's here quite a bit.

00:16:32
<transcript>: And it's an ongoing topic with my wife or with my mom.

00:16:47
<transcript>: But she knows where I stand, and that is that I don't currently believe what I was raised in. I don't want to be too controversial here. Why am I afraid of offending people by just talking about, oh, yeah, the macbook thing.

00:16:47
<transcript>: i think

00:16:52
<transcript>: I think I'm not afraid of offending you all I'm afraid of offending my mother.

00:16:53
overra_dev: LUL

00:16:58
<transcript>: My beliefs are complicated.

00:16:58
<transcript>: my wife

00:17:05
<transcript>: My wife and I had similar, complicated beliefs. And there we go. Now we're going into the macbooks. Now we're going into.

00:17:13
<transcript>: Can you win a macbook? You can potentially it's a very small chance and you can only redeem it twice.

00:17:13
<transcript>: today

00:17:14
overra_dev: Thanks for sharing Adam

00:17:17
<transcript>: Today on this stream. Twice every stream. So come back tomorrow.

00:17:18
stroopwafel26: i believe in our lord and saviour vim + dracula

00:17:18

00:17:22

00:17:38

00:17:38
<transcript>: the chainsaw

00:17:41
foobfoob: now we also need a way to win bits

00:17:46
<transcript>: The chainsaw? That's a good song. Here we go with the macbooks. Everybody get them out of the way. Let's just get them out of the way so we can move on with our day.

00:17:46
impostorengineer: 50k points to 1-to-1 you :)

00:17:51
<transcript>: I'm not afraid to talk about beliefs on stream. I guess I just never have.

00:17:57
<transcript>: And I know people get in their fields when you start talking about politics.

00:17:57
<transcript>: and

00:18:00
<transcript>: And spirituality.

00:18:09
<transcript>: Just happens. So I've mostly avoided it. I don't think I've talked politics either. Have I ever talked about politics on here? Mostly. I just don't have many opinions.

00:18:09
<transcript>: fifty thousand

00:18:15
<transcript>: 50,000 points to one on one. U. That's right. Imposter. Come on.

00:18:15
<transcript>: somebody get

00:18:26
cowfacedev: that zoom was funny LUL. when you said about religion...

00:18:28
<transcript>: Somebody get there. No one has taken me up on it, so I don't know what that means. Nobody wants to talk. I think I said it so high because I thought if it's too low, then I'll just be like my whole job will just be being on phone calls.

00:18:28
<transcript>: the fifty

00:18:30
<transcript>: The 50,000 may have been too high.

00:18:31
zxshan: I'm saving up!

00:18:32
overra_dev: @ImpostorEngineer i forgot about that before I dumped all my points

00:18:33
stroopwafel26: Frag had 50k at some point right?

00:18:34
vimcerf: I feel like too much of an impostor to 1-on-1 you

00:18:36
<transcript>: Did it Zoom it's zooming a lot. It seems to be bouncing around. It seems very indecisive.

00:18:45
<transcript>: Frag had 50,000 at some point. He just didn't even want to talk to me. Fine. Frag fine. He's also not here this morning. Double fine.

00:18:45
<transcript>: i feel like too much of an

00:18:52
<transcript>: I feel like too much of an imposter to one on one. You're not an impostor. Nobody's an imposter. I've actually never understood the imposter thing.

00:18:58
<transcript>: I think the imposter Syndrome thing.

00:19:03
cowfacedev: I spent my points on rick rolling you LUL

00:19:13
<transcript>: Is also speaking of there's imposter imposter engineer did not win a macbook. No one has won yet. The impostor thing fit your points. Rick rowling, did it not work, cowface? Sorry about it. It probably didn't even work.

00:19:15
looch94: would you do any leetcode for fun on stream @adamdotdev?

00:19:21
<transcript>: Impostor syndrome is a thing I have never had and let's talk about it actually. Let's talk about it before I start actually coding and stuff.

00:19:21
<transcript>: would you do any

00:19:29
<transcript>: Would you do any leak code for fun on Stream? Yes, luch, I would because I want to be a competitive programmer, but it's like.

00:19:29
<transcript>: number like eight

00:19:33
cowfacedev: You owe me a rickroll.

00:19:34
<transcript>: Number, like eight on my list of things I want to be, so I just haven't gotten to it.

00:19:42
<transcript>: So imposter syndrome. I do owe you a Rick roll cafes or I owe you five chances at a MacBook? Would you take five chances at a MacBook.

00:19:48
<transcript>: Do we have a deal? I'll do them right now.

00:19:53
<transcript>: So impostor syndrome.

00:19:53
<transcript>: i think

00:19:55
cowfacedev: those were some streams in a December...

00:19:56
<transcript>: I think there's a few things at play here. One.

00:20:01
stroopwafel26: adam handing out great deals

00:20:01
<transcript>: Whenever I say I don't have never had impostor syndrome.

00:20:01
<transcript>: i

00:20:21
<transcript>: I feel like a jerk because everyone's like, you're just an overconfident American, and I probably am. But I don't think it's that because there's plenty of overconfident Americans that seem to feel this thing called impostor Syndrome. Here's why I think it's the same. It's the same psychology that makes people scared to program in front of people. I think maybe that's not.

00:20:24
<transcript>: A leap. Maybe that's very obvious, actually.

00:20:30
<transcript>: But I also have no fear of programming in front of people because I don't hold any.

00:20:33
<transcript>: Illusion.

00:20:37
<transcript>: I don't hold the sentiment, I don't hold any.

00:20:37
<transcript>: false

00:20:40
<transcript>: False idea of what my abilities are.

00:20:40
<transcript>: i think

00:20:42
<transcript>: I think if maybe.

00:20:48
<transcript>: There's something to that. I don't actually think what I'm doing is special.

00:20:50
cowfacedev: I think I will take you up on that offer.

00:20:53
<transcript>: I don't think there's anything you could say about me writing code that would make me feel bad.

00:20:57
<transcript>: It's not like my personhood.

00:20:59
<transcript>: It's just a thing I do.

00:20:59
<transcript>: for my occ

00:21:05
<transcript>: For my occupation. And I enjoy it a lot. And the worst case is, you see, I did something.

00:21:05
<transcript>: completely

00:21:10
<transcript>: Completely asinine. And you correct me. And now I know a better way to do it. You know what I'm saying.

00:21:10
<transcript>: you will

00:21:12
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: So staying humble.

00:21:18
<transcript>: You will take nap on that offer. Here we go. Five of them. Five of them right now for cowface. The Zoom just got out of control.

00:21:26
overra_dev: LUL

00:21:26
<transcript>: Handing out great deals. Here we go. I'm going to do this five times for Cow face. Here we go. One.

00:21:26
<transcript>: i did not

00:21:36
stroopwafel26: you are the most chill and humble person ever and i strive to be like that

00:21:36
<transcript>: I did not win how funny would it be if I won? On behalf of Calface? Can we share it? Cafes? If we both would just kidding. Did not win.

00:21:36
<transcript>: here

00:21:38
<transcript>: Here we go.

00:21:38
impostorengineer: what are the chances?

00:21:41
<transcript>: Chance to the macbook. I'll get back to the Empire.

00:21:41
<transcript>: thing

00:21:44
stroopwafel26: i'm not chill

00:21:44
<transcript>: Thing. Oh, no, I can only do it twice.

00:21:52
<transcript>: I can only do it twice. Just like you all just like all the peasants.

00:21:52
<transcript>: so

00:21:54
<transcript>: So staying humble.

00:21:58
<transcript>: So the real enrico. I don't know if it's humble. I just know.

00:21:58
<transcript>: i don't

00:22:00
<transcript>: I don't get anything out of.

00:22:01
cowfacedev: I will come back tomorrow...

00:22:16
<transcript>: Some perception of what I am or am not. Does that make sense? I also might be weird. I might just be a very strange person. Yeah. Calface. We'll get two more tomorrow and then one more the next day and you should be whole. You don't even have to be here. I'll just remember to do it.

00:22:18
manbravegg: I sort of agree. People feel that way because they put too much weight in to what others think. But, you also cant blame them, because a lot of companies have tons of toxic culture that reinforces people feeling that way.

00:22:20
<transcript>: And I'll let you know if you won.

00:22:33
<transcript>: Stroop, you're the most chill and humble person ever. And I strive to be like that. See, I don't know if I am. I don't really know if I understand fully what humble is. We also discovered about me that I don't really feel emotions that could be part of the problem.

00:22:33
<transcript>: i may

00:22:36
<transcript>: I may be trying to.

00:22:36
<transcript>: explain

00:22:47
<transcript>: Explain to you all how you should be like me when it's impossible, because you feel emotions. And I don't. For some reason I thought that I don't feel emotions. It's just very shallow. I have a very shallow emotional depth.

00:22:50
aisebaxp: Bend the rules and get the other 3 vamoaJajant

00:22:53
<transcript>: But I think the reason I'm not scared to program in front of anybody ever and.

00:22:53
<transcript>: is the same reason

00:22:58
stroopwafel26: I'd like to feel less emotions sometimes hehe

00:23:01
<transcript>: Is the same reason I've never felt impostor imposter Syndrome, and I don't even honestly know what it would feel like. I hear people describe it like you feel like people are going to discover.

00:23:13
<transcript>: That you aren't actually any good at this. I don't know. Just maybe assume you're not very good at whatever it is and just go into it thinking. I'm just always going to be learning. Maybe that maybe that would help. I don't know.

00:23:24
<transcript>: I sort of agree. People feel that way because they put too much weight into what others think. But you also can't blame them because a lot of companies have tons of toxic culture that reinforces, oh, absolutely.

00:23:36
aisebaxp: You are not trying to impress anyone

00:23:36
<transcript>: I don't think this is an individual problem. I think it's like a societal problem, probably. And I know it's very common. So I'm not like trying to shame anybody that has these feelings. I think they're very valid.

00:23:42
<transcript>: I wish I could help distill whatever it is in me that has not felt that in my career.

00:23:42
<transcript>: and give it

00:23:44
<transcript>: And give it to people.

00:23:50
<transcript>: As like a little potion or something. An antidote. Bend the rules and get the other three.

00:23:55
<transcript>: Oh, yeah? I guess I could turn off the limit.

00:24:07
<transcript>: I'd like to feel less emotion sometimes. Well, I'd like to feel more, actually stroop for my wife's sake. Sometimes I'd like to feel more emotions. So maybe we could meet in the middle.

00:24:09
<transcript>: You're not trying to impress anyone.

00:24:10
stroopwafel26: want some of mine?

00:24:16
texoport: I think the trick is to not derive your sense of self-worth from how good of a programmer you are. That helped me, I like to think

00:24:18
<transcript>: I don't know. I don't know exactly what it is. If I figure it out, I'll make a course and I'll sell it for nubskins.

00:24:21
manbravegg: Yea very much a societal issues. We are taught all our lives failure is bad, when in fact struggling and failure is what leads to that break through.

00:24:25
<transcript>: I'll let you all know you all will be the first to know everyone in twitch chat if I figure out exactly how to articulate.

00:24:25
<transcript>: why

00:24:28
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: What if you try to impress yourself?

00:24:32
<transcript>: Why it is. I don't have impostor syndrome. I know. I saw prime like he did a video. I think a YouTube video.

00:24:32
<transcript>: about

00:24:41
<transcript>: About this. Like he's never felt impostor syndrome. So something about prime and me. I have something in common with him. I don't feel impostor syndrome. I don't know what that's about.

00:24:41
<transcript>: but

00:24:45
<transcript>: But you shouldn't either. And I hope I can help somehow. Just.

00:24:45
<transcript>: spend the next few

00:24:47
foobfoob: will you finish the fullstack web aws thing or is it posponed without a final date? :)

00:24:53
<transcript>: Spend the next few months every day for 4 hours with me. Maybe we'll figure it out together. How about that? How's that for a plug.

00:24:56
overra_dev: LUL I feels like a perspective adjustment but not sure how to articulate beyond that

00:25:01
<transcript>: I think the trick is to not derive your sense of self worth from how good of a program you are. That helped me. I like to think. Yeah. No, that sounds.

00:25:01
<transcript>: very accurate

00:25:04
<transcript>: Very accurate tech support.

00:25:08
<transcript>: Like it's not your personhood on the line.

00:25:08
<transcript>: maybe that helps

00:25:08
overra_dev: idk what im sayin

00:25:10
<transcript>: Maybe that helps. I don't know.

00:25:10
<transcript>: very much

00:25:21
<transcript>: Very much a societal issue. We are taught all of our lives. Failure is bad when, in fact, struggling. Failure is what leads to that breakthrough. That's true. It could be like just the environment you were raised in.

00:25:21
<transcript>: like how

00:25:30
<transcript>: Like, how was failure viewed? I don't know. Maybe my parents did a good job with that. I'm really, honestly not sure. I'm not a very self reflective or self aware person.

00:25:30
<transcript>: very much

00:25:36
<transcript>: Very much. I already read that. What if you try to impress yourself? Nothing wrong with that. I don't think.

00:25:43
<transcript>: Trying to impress yourself. I definitely do think I spend more of life.

00:25:50
<transcript>: Thinking of life as a single player game than a multiplayer, and that has a lot of meanings.

00:25:53
<transcript>: I'm trying to unpack it.

00:25:57
<transcript>: Socially. I think I view things as a single player.

00:26:00
<transcript>: I'm not a very socially connected person.

00:26:05
<transcript>: But also in terms of mastery.

00:26:05
<transcript>: i do enjoy

00:26:08
<transcript>: I do enjoy the grind of improving on something.

00:26:08
<transcript>: and

00:26:15
<transcript>: And that's reflected in a long history of mine of getting obsessed with something for some period of time.

00:26:15
<transcript>: and then

00:26:19
<transcript>: And then kind of like moving on. Eventually.

00:26:19
<transcript>: will you finish

00:26:39
<transcript>: Will you finish the full stack Web aws thing? Where is it postponed without a final date? It's definitely postponed. Although I keep thinking of if I did it today, it would basically just be like an SST course, because I think aws for web devs SST is that so if I do it, that's what it'll be. And I don't know if I know SST enough yet.

00:26:39
<transcript>: to

00:26:42
<transcript>: To make a course without feeling like a grifter.

00:26:42
<transcript>: i feel like i'd just be

00:26:44
<transcript>: I feel like I'd just be bugging dax the whole time.

00:26:48
<transcript>: Hey, dax, I'm working on this course.

00:26:48
<transcript>: and

00:26:49
mecoupz: a dumb question: what was that macbook thing about couple minutes earlier? does adam have so many macbooks that he gives them away lol

00:26:49
texoport: I was raised to believe that academics was the only thing that mattered, and I was supposed to get a PhD and all that BS. Getting out of that, and realizing that I didn't need to achieve xyz to be happy made all the difference. It sounds so simple but it took far longer than I'm proud to admit

00:27:00
<transcript>: And I need you to explain to me everything about ssd so I can teach other people. Now I know that it's the answer. I just don't know that I know it well enough to feel good about making that course, if that makes sense.

00:27:20
<transcript>: Ovara it feels like a perspective adjustment, but not sure how to articulate beyond that. Yeah, I don't know what I'm saying either. Ovara So I'm going to stop saying it, and we're going to get to work because at some point whenever I get stuck thinking about something too hard and I'm like, I just can't come up with the answer. It's because I'm not doing enough. I just need to be doing something and.

00:27:20
<transcript>: this is a

00:27:24
<transcript>: This is a tiny little microphasm of that I need to be doing right now.

00:27:24
<transcript>: so

00:27:25
<transcript>: So we're going to do.

00:27:25
<transcript>: something

00:27:27
<transcript>: Something.

00:27:31
overra_dev: so do

00:27:32
<transcript>: Benjamin did not win a macbook Pro. Sorry, Benjamin.

00:27:32
<transcript>: ben naj

00:27:34
<transcript>: Ben Najman.

00:27:34
<transcript>: try again

00:27:35
binajmen: xD

00:27:36
<transcript>: Try again.

00:27:36
<transcript>: dumb question

00:27:41
<transcript>: Dumb question. What was that macbook thing about a couple of minutes earlier? Does Adam have so many macbooks that he gives me away. Mccoups.

00:27:46
<transcript>: I don't have this one on hand, but I will buy one for whoever wins.

00:27:46
<transcript>: you can

00:27:49
<transcript>: You can redeem 1000 points twice a stream.

00:27:49
<transcript>: for

00:27:52
<transcript>: For a chance at winning a MacBook.

00:27:52
<transcript>: and

00:27:55
<transcript>: And it's a very tiny chance, but.

00:27:55
<transcript>: it's going to happen

00:28:00
<transcript>: It's going to happen one of these days. And it's going to be very exciting when it does.

00:28:00
<transcript>: we're all going to

00:28:04
<transcript>: We're all going to lose it. You're not going to want to miss it.

00:28:06
looch94: what are you drinking?

00:28:07
<transcript>: How am I doing on the engagement tactics.

00:28:11
stroopwafel26: @adamdotdev I was watching Dax's stream the other day and called his stream cringe like he does yours and he said "that actually hurts" so that worked out lmao

00:28:21
<transcript>: Luch, I am drinking dandelion with some mushroom stuff in it. It's got some Lions Mane and I put some Cordiceps in it.

00:28:21
<transcript>: cord

00:28:33
looch94: I have no idea what any of those things are

00:28:33
<transcript>: Cordyceps. Cordy. I don't know if it's cordiceps. Cordyceps. Something like that. I was watching dax's stream the other day and called his stream cringe like he does yours.

00:28:37
looch94: is it some kind of tea? lol

00:28:38
manbravegg: @texoport Yea, I am only pursuing a degree because its being paid for by my company. Otherwise I would not waste the time. Formal school often doesn't teach things well enough anyway. So its crazy how much weight people put on it.

00:28:40
<transcript>: And he said that actually hurts. So that worked. That's funny. Thank you, stroop, for that.

00:28:45
mecoupz: i dont even know what 1000 points are :D

00:28:48
<transcript>: I have no idea what any of those things are. Is it some kind of T? Yeah. Sorry. Dandy blend is like a dandelion Root T.

00:28:57
<transcript>: And then the mushrooms. They're about giving some. I don't know. Focus. I don't know. I just believe mushrooms are very powerful. And.

00:28:57
<transcript>: when there's

00:28:59
<transcript>: When there's like nutrition.

00:29:04
<transcript>: There's like supplements. I can buy that have mushrooms in them. I buy them.

00:29:04
<transcript>: you

00:29:10
arthurofbavaria: sup peeps

00:29:11
<transcript>: You don't even know me, coop's. What 1000 points are they're called Channel Points? Well, they're Adam Bucks around these parts.

00:29:11
<transcript>: in the bottom

00:29:17
<transcript>: In the bottom left of my stream like below chat, you should see a little Golden.

00:29:17
<transcript>: me

00:29:17
tunvior: hey, is your neovim config available?

00:29:21
<transcript>: Me like it's my face. But it's gold, like a coin.

00:29:23
arthurofbavaria: hows everyone doing

00:29:33
<transcript>: Those are your Adam Bucks, and you can spin them for things like a chance at a macbook or a one on one phone call with me, Arthur. Welcome to Chat. What's going on.

00:29:36
adamdotdev: !dotfiles

00:29:36
<transcript>: Tenveyor Yes.

00:29:36
<transcript>: my

00:29:36
fossabot: Adam's dotfiles live here: https://github.com/adamelmore/dotfiles

00:29:40
<transcript>: My dot files. Have my neo vim set up in there.

00:29:40
<transcript>: in my

00:29:43
<transcript>: In my dot files.

00:29:45
juniornascm: I was saving to a 1:1 call

00:29:47
tunvior: great, thanks :)

00:29:49
<transcript>: Let's see. Oh, yeah? So dandelion root T that's what that's all about.

00:29:50
<transcript>: Alastair Dev.

00:29:52
mecoupz: ooooooh now i get it. thanks for that

00:30:00
<transcript>: Oh, Chance, in my book I keep I keep seeing notifications and things on xlm. It followed me, but Alice, you followed me a long time ago.

00:30:00
<transcript>: so i

00:30:03
arthurofbavaria: ayyyy neovim! im a vim user but I can respect going neo

00:30:07
<transcript>: So I don't know why I didn't notice that saving to a one on one call that would be so fun. Junior, please do.

00:30:10
<transcript>: Reb Rebel thank you for the follow.

00:30:17
<transcript>: I'm only pursuing a degree because it's being paid for by my company. Otherwise, I would not waste the time.

00:30:24
<transcript>: Formal school often doesn't teach things well enough anyway, so it's crazy how much weight people put on it. I have.

00:30:24
<transcript>: similar

00:30:27
<transcript>: Similar feelings about formal education.

00:30:27
<transcript>: i don't want to

00:30:30
zxshan: Gonna head out for a climb, back later! Good seeing you back @adamdotdev

00:30:31
<transcript>: I don't want to tell anybody not to go to school because that just feels bad.

00:30:31
<transcript>: but i was

00:30:31
binajmen: I figured out recently that frameworks like Remix, Next or even Astro invite you to build your API within the framework itself. But I believe this is bad practice in the long run if your project scale. Mine is not scaling yet, but when I think about side app I could build on top of my current database, I'm so pissed off I didn't split the API backend in a separate app. Which monorepo tool I should look at?

00:30:46
<transcript>: But I was raised to believe that academics was the only thing that mattered. And I was supposed to get a PhD and all that bs getting out of that and realizing I didn't need to achieve xyz to be happy made all the difference. Sounds so simple, but it took far longer than I'm proud to admit. No, it's so true. Tech support. It's amazing how.

00:30:48
looch94: what are your feelings on coding bootcamps?

00:30:51
<transcript>: Perspective is so important in life. I mean, really.

00:30:51
<transcript>: people

00:30:59
<transcript>: People are very happy with very little there's people that are very happy with a lot. But ultimately that's kind of up to you.

00:31:07
<transcript>: Arthur, How's everyone doing? I think we're doing well. Is everyone doing well? I'm doing well? Is everyone else doing well.

00:31:12
fryday444: Good enough for a monday

00:31:14
<transcript>: Arthur is a vim user.

00:31:14
<transcript>: zx

00:31:19
<transcript>: Zxan we'll see you when you get back good to be back.

00:31:19
<transcript>: i'm

00:31:27
mecoupz: i'm just here to find out how adam has setup obs so that i can copy it :D

00:31:30
<transcript>: I'm reading everyone's messages because I'm not ready to actually work yet. I'm more ready to read and interact with you people. I figured out. I keep saying, you people. I keep calling you you people.

00:31:30
<transcript>: does that offend

00:31:32
<transcript>: Does that offend anybody.

00:31:32
<transcript>: i

00:31:35
luco_mo: hi chat!! I want a book lul xD

00:31:36
olid75: oh god its this font

00:31:38
mecoupz: "we" people

00:31:48
<transcript>: I figured out recently that frameworks like remix Next or even astro invite you to build your api within the framework itself. I believe this is bad practice in the long run. If your project scales, mine is not scaling yet, but when I think about sideapp I could build on top of my current database.

00:31:49
vimcerf: us people on the twitch

00:31:50
zxshan: "You people" shoutout Tropic Thunder

00:31:55
<transcript>: I'm so pissed off that I didn't split the api back in in a separate app. Which monoripo tool should I look at? Okay, let's unpack all that.

00:31:57
<transcript>: So.

00:32:04
cowfacedev: @binajmen sst might be the choice for you...

00:32:08
arthurofbavaria: Im a game dev so I figured it would be nice to meet others in the community. maybe we can work together one of these days :p

00:32:14
cowfacedev: !sst

00:32:14
fossabot: SST is the best way to create modern applications on AWS, and Dax (@thdxr) is a co-founder there. https://sst.dev

00:32:14
<transcript>: I have similar feelings about some of this. I think the thing I would say is it's opt in like, you don't have to build your api in those things. I think for stupid side projects that are like, you know, you're not scaling it like you literally or like I just make a lot of stuff just for me.

00:32:14
<transcript>: like my

00:32:23
<transcript>: Like my overlay app is just an xjs app. So there are cases where it's really handy to just have api routes, just like that's what I'm going to do for this.

00:32:23
<transcript>: i'm not going to

00:32:23
zxshan: "You people" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPxs0Qh72kY

00:32:26
<transcript>: I'm not going to plan on growing any beyond that.

00:32:26
<transcript>: i don't need

00:32:30
arthurofbavaria: Im a C++ raylib guy tho XD

00:32:30
<transcript>: I don't need a full fledged api that I have more granular control over.

00:32:39
<transcript>: I think for those cases, those paradigms are really nice. But I think a lot of people do go down that path and then realize later that.

00:32:39
<transcript>: they should have kind of

00:32:42
<transcript>: They should have kind of built things out separately.

00:32:42
<transcript>: that they had

00:32:56
<transcript>: That they had, I don't know, needs that went beyond what you can accomplish with api routes and the like. So I guess I don't fault the frameworks for having that easy little option for defining api Stuff server side stuff.

00:32:56
<transcript>: but

00:33:00
<transcript>: But it is sort of a footgun. And I recognize that.

00:33:00
<transcript>: so then

00:33:04
<transcript>: So then the next question was, which monoripo tools should I look at.

00:33:08
<transcript>: So I've used turbo repo in the past.

00:33:11
aisebaxp: Are you using the latest astro built

00:33:28
<transcript>: I know some people are real big into the index thing I can't with NX it just seems like so much to learn, but my favorite mono repo tool these days is sst because if you're building full stack apps, you've got front end using one of those things like you described remix next, astro, whatever solid start you've got a front end you've got.

00:33:28
<transcript>: a back end

00:33:44
<transcript>: A back end api. And you want to define that api separately. You're probably going to build it in aws. If you're going to build an aws, ssd is absolutely the best way to do that. You're just going to want to do that. So maybe just try ssc. It gives you a nice mono repo structure built in it's. Really nice.

00:33:45
binajmen: Ok I'll check both Turborepo & SST :) Ty for your input

00:33:53
<transcript>: What are your feelings on coding boot camps? I don't have a lot of feelings about them. I know it's worked for some people. Some people. Maybe not.

00:33:57
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: trackpad and not a mouse???

00:34:03
<transcript>: I think the thing about software Dev is you do have to be an auto died act. You have to be a self learner, right.

00:34:06
<transcript>: And however you get up to speed.

00:34:06
<transcript>: with kind of

00:34:24
<transcript>: With kind of what's going on in software dev. And just like getting your bearings on the basics. However, you want to do that, whether that's College self taught, whether that's a boot camp, you're going to have to keep learning after that. So I think that's the more important thing. It's just like really enjoying the process of learning.

00:34:33
<transcript>: The bootcamp thing. I'm sure like some organizations put weight in it so it could probably help you get a job at those organizations. I don't know in today's market what that looks like.

00:34:36
<transcript>: Is a tougher hiring market at the moment.

00:34:42
<transcript>: Yeah. That's about all the thoughts I have in my brain about coding boot camps. Good enough for a Monday.

00:34:42
<transcript>: i'm just here

00:34:48
<transcript>: I'm just here to find out how Adam has set up obs so I can copy it. Hey, me, coops. Guess what? I'm changing everything.

00:34:54
<transcript>: No, I'm actually going to make some like I'm going to make some content around this. I hate saying that.

00:34:54
<transcript>: i literally

00:34:55
mecoupz: HAHAHA

00:34:56
<transcript>: I literally hate those words.

00:34:56
<transcript>: i'm going to

00:35:10
<transcript>: I'm going to make some guides or something. I have to create something around this because I'm too passionate about this streaming programming thing. I want to help other people do it. That's like the whole Watch dev thing. So I'm going to make something maybe a video series.

00:35:10
<transcript>: probably not

00:35:23
<transcript>: Probably not a blog post. I don't really write much, but I'm going to document in some form. I'm going to create something to help other people get into this because I do think it's a lot of fun. It's changed my career entirely.

00:35:26
overra_dev: Maybe a watch.dev collaborative effort?

00:35:30
<transcript>: Hi, Chat. I want a book. You want a book? What book? Luko? What book.

00:35:30
<transcript>: oled

00:35:37
<transcript>: Oled. Welcome to Chat. O, God, is this font? Yeah. Operator. Mono. I'm sorry. You can blame Jason Langstore for being so cool.

00:35:37
<transcript>: and

00:35:40
<transcript>: And influencing me years ago.

00:35:46
<transcript>: You people shout out tropic, Thunder.

00:35:55
<transcript>: I'm a game dev. So I figured it would be nice to meet others in the community. Maybe we can work together one of these days. That sounds fun. Arthur.

00:35:55
<transcript>: game

00:36:02
<transcript>: Game Dev is so like hard for me to get my head around just like working with 3d stuff.

00:36:02
<transcript>: it kind of hurts

00:36:04
<transcript>: It kind of hurts my brain.

00:36:05
overra_dev: ^ putting together streaming guide

00:36:06
<transcript>: You people.

00:36:16
<transcript>: C Plus Plus raylib guy. That sounds super complicated. Ray lib. Is that like Ray tracing? I'm just guessing.

00:36:16
<transcript>: are using

00:36:20
<transcript>: Are using the latest astrobuild. I think I'm using two. One. Yeah, I think so.

00:36:28
<transcript>: Okay, I'll check both turbo repo and ssd. Thank you for your input. No problem. Ben. Andrewman.

00:36:37
broccodev: can agree, streaming dev is a bunch of fun... hitting the "go live" button is the hardest part

00:36:46
<transcript>: Trackpad and not a mouse. Yeah, I've been using a trackpad for a while now. Probably like five years. I abandoned a mouse in hopes that I would use the trackpad less because it's less convenient than a mouse. So I wanted to use my keyboard more. That did not work. Going to Neovim did work.

00:36:50
<transcript>: That managed to make me use my mouse a lot less.

00:36:50
<transcript>: maybe

00:36:54
manbravegg: Game dev is way over my head. Game dev seems like such a insanely high barrier to entry. Like you need to know c# or c++. music composition, 3d modeling, etc just to get started.

00:36:54
<transcript>: Maybe a watch Dev collaborative effort may be.

00:36:54
<transcript>: maybe we'll

00:37:04
arthurofbavaria: raylib is a group of framworks for doing various things :) it can help you make ai, 3d rendering, etc. It basically makes it easier to do game specific stuff without having to code it from scratch.

00:37:05
<transcript>: Maybe we'll all share. Oh, we could do, like, a panel. The watch side dev streamers could do, like a panel on things we've learned. Streaming software. Dev. That sounds fantastic. Someone right that down. I wish dax were here. Who would remember.

00:37:09
tayloreddev: Anything is better than the god awful apple magic mouse

00:37:10
<transcript>: Putting together streaming guides. Yes, we're going to do it. It's going to be a collaborative effort.

00:37:10
<transcript>: welcome to chat

00:37:13
mecoupz: @BroccoDev that and configuring obs the way you like. and after that took you 5 hours you still need to configure alerts and all the other crap

00:37:17
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat, brocco. Dev can agree. Streaming Dev is a bunch of fun. Hitting the Go Live button is the hardest part. Yeah, no.

00:37:21
overra_dev: watch.dev panel on streaming dev

00:37:22
<transcript>: I think once you get started, you just have to go into it knowing.

00:37:22
<transcript>: the first

00:37:29
<transcript>: The first weeks are going to be tough. You're going to learn a lot. It's like any other new thing you do. You're going to learn a lot.

00:37:29
<transcript>: it's going to be kind of pain

00:37:32
<transcript>: It's going to be kind of painful. You're going to feel uncomfortable.

00:37:34
<transcript>: And then over time.

00:37:34
<transcript>: it's really ful

00:37:34
vimcerf: @TayloredDev but the charging upside down memes are so good

00:37:48
<transcript>: It's really fulfilling and I promise it's worth the wait. Like most things that take hard work game dev is way over my head game dev seems like such an insanely high barrier to entry. You can need an oc sharp or C plus plus, music composition, 3d modeling, et cetera. Yeah.

00:37:48
<transcript>: maybe

00:37:51
<transcript>: Maybe AI could help. I don't know.

00:38:01
arthurofbavaria: game dev isnt as hard as it seems. you dont need to be amazing, just good enough and then "ship it" lol

00:38:01
<transcript>: Raylib is a group of frameworks for doing various things can help you make AI 3d rendering, et cetera. It basically makes it easier to do game specific stuff without having to code it from scratch. Okay.

00:38:03
<transcript>: Interesting.

00:38:11
<transcript>: Anything is better than the God awful Apple Magic Mouse. Yeah, they're not very handy, are they? They're kind of annoying. I don't like using them.

00:38:13
broccodev: @mecoupz yes, but you can definitely start super simple and add on as you go while making sure you enjoy it

00:38:20
alongwithcris: Unreal engine has really good tutorials

00:38:31
<transcript>: So when I said I'm changing everything, I'm going to change. I'm going to start streaming on YouTube as well. I don't know. I might regret this. I'm going to try the multi stream thing. I did it early on, but I used restream and it was so delayed. Now I'm going to try the obs plugin route with multi rtmp output.

00:38:35
<transcript>: R Real time rtmp Yeah.

00:38:42
manbravegg: @ArthurOfBavaria This mentality is why every game has experience breaking bugs.

00:38:43
<transcript>: I'm going to try doing that. Might even start tomorrow, but I'm going to change my overlays and all my obs settings.

00:38:43
<transcript>: to actually

00:38:53
<transcript>: To actually have a base format of 4k. I'm going to turn my overlays everything from one thousand and eighty P to four K, and I'm a down sample for Twitch because Twitch I can't do 4k.

00:38:53
<transcript>: so twitch

00:39:03
<transcript>: So Twitch I'll be sending 1080p like I am today, but on YouTube Live. You could watch me in 4k. Who's excited? Nobody. Nobody uses YouTube live.

00:39:06
<transcript>: But I'm going to do that.

00:39:10
mecoupz: larabar in 4k? i'm in

00:39:12
<transcript>: Charging upside down memes are so good.

00:39:14
arthurofbavaria: @AlongWithCris honestly I think its better when people start low level. that way you learn much more and have good fundamentals

00:39:19
<transcript>: That Mac Mac mouse charging situation is hilarious.

00:39:25
<transcript>: You don't need to be amazing. Just good enough. And then ship it. That sounds like normal dev. Arthur. Sounds like normal dev, too.

00:39:31
<transcript>: Can definitely start super simple and add on as you go while making sure you enjoy it exactly.

00:39:33
<transcript>: Don't go in too hard.

00:39:33
<transcript>: sometimes

00:39:38
<transcript>: Sometimes I go in too hard on things, and then you feel like you've invested so much.

00:39:40
sj_se: Adam are you vegan?

00:39:41
stroopwafel26: let me complain about recruiters once more, they all give off such bad vibes

00:39:44
<transcript>: And you feel guilty for stopping.

00:39:49
<transcript>: Unreal engine has really good tutorials tutorials.

00:39:49
<transcript>: mentali

00:39:54
<transcript>: Mentality is why every game has experience breaking bugs.

00:40:02
<transcript>: Larbarn. 4k. Mccoups is in all right, honestly, I think it's better when people start low level. That way you learn much more and have good fundamentals.

00:40:02
<transcript>: sj ad

00:40:07
<transcript>: Sj. Adam? Are you vegan? Yes, I am a vegan.

00:40:07
<transcript>: we just

00:40:20
<transcript>: We just celebrated actually a couple of months ago or last month, February. We celebrated ten years of plant based eating. Sometimes I don't like saying vegan because it has so many negative connotations. But we are I mean, we are vegan.

00:40:23
arthurofbavaria: well games have lots of bugs because so many systems come together, but thats something that you refine as you go

00:40:23
<transcript>: It's like plant based eating is a little more.

00:40:26
<transcript>: Why we do it.

00:40:26
<transcript>: we did it we're starting out

00:40:32
<transcript>: We did it. We're starting out for health reasons. I guess we've kind of grown into a lot of the other things in terms of veganism.

00:40:41
<transcript>: Like just the ethical animal treatment stuff. The ecological impact. So environmental stuff. Yeah. I guess we're vegan.

00:40:41
<transcript>: i should just

00:40:44
sj_se: true vegan is more than a diet, it is a lifestyle. I worked with a lifestyle vegan and it was very interesting.

00:40:44
<transcript>: I should just lean into it. We're vegan.

00:40:44
<transcript>: in all the ways

00:40:50
vimcerf: vegan has too much of a karen vibe over it

00:40:51
<transcript>: In all the ways that that word has meaning. Pylon. Thank you so much for that. Follow. Pylon.

00:40:53
arthurofbavaria: also thats super cool, im a vegetarian :)

00:41:00
<transcript>: Let me complain about recruiters once more they all give off such bad vibes. I wonder what will happen to the tech recruiting industry now that.

00:41:04
<transcript>: The music stopped and things are not looking great.

00:41:19
<transcript>: For the dev talent market, if you will. Well, games have lots of bugs because so many systems come together, but that's something that you refine as you go. True. Vegan is more than a diet. It is a lifestyle. It works with a lifestyle. Vegan. It was very interesting. Yeah. I would say.

00:41:24
<transcript>: We're like 80% true Vegan, so I know.

00:41:24
<transcript>: it

00:41:29
<transcript>: It goes very far. Some people like so I mean, we're vegan enough. We don't eat honey.

00:41:29
<transcript>: we don't eat anything

00:41:30
<transcript>: We don't eat anything.

00:41:34
<transcript>: An animal had to do work for or.

00:41:40
<transcript>: Just nothing like that. So it's not just like, oh, we don't eat meat and dairy. We do respect.

00:41:40
<transcript>: like animal

00:41:44
<transcript>: Like animal welfare as much as we possibly can. But I know there's some people that.

00:41:44
<transcript>: they take it

00:41:53
<transcript>: They take it to further extremes, like in terms of not driving cars because of killing bugs. I don't know. There's all kinds of things that people do. We don't go that far.

00:41:53
<transcript>: so we

00:41:56
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: Don't ask a farmer how many critters, boars etc. they kill for a single field they grow tho... It's a battle vs nature. We tend to forget that

00:42:03
<transcript>: So we do live a pretty normal, practical life, but we try to respect living things as much as possible. Arthur, thank you for that. Follow. Thank you so much.

00:42:03
<transcript>: vegan has too much

00:42:23
<transcript>: Vegan has too much of a Karen vibe. Yeah, just the word vegan. I just hate saying it because people just immediately are like, oh, you just wanted to tell me you're a vegan? No, I really don't. I really don't care if, you know, I'm vegan. I just care. Like, when you ask me out to eat and I'm like, I can't eat at a steakhouse. I'm sorry. It's just not going to have anything for me. And I'm hungry. Like, I'm hungry. And I want to eat food. And I can't eat food in American steakhouse. So I don't want to go eat with.

00:42:23
<transcript>: you

00:42:26
stroopwafel26: what if an arch user is also a vegan

00:42:28
<transcript>: You at American steakhouse. That's when I have to tell people I'm vegan.

00:42:28
<transcript>: otherwise i try

00:42:28
alongwithcris: yeah its hard to draw a distinct line in the sand for where to stop for veganism.

00:42:30
<transcript>: Otherwise I try not to.

00:42:30
<transcript>: arthur

00:42:34
looch94: could you eat fries at a steakhouse?

00:42:40
<transcript>: Arthur, you're vegetarian. Hey, don't ask a farmer how many critters boars, et cetera. They kill for a single field. They grow. Though it's a battle versus nature. We tend to forget that.

00:42:43
<transcript>: What if an arch user is also a vegan.

00:42:43
<transcript>: i used

00:42:46
<transcript>: I used arch, by the way. I don't know if you know this.

00:42:46
<transcript>: i used

00:42:48
<transcript>: I used it.

00:42:48
<transcript>: one

00:42:54
smilingbig: I like to eat vegan while I code rust on arch btw

00:42:56
<transcript>: 111. D. D. 111 thank you for that. Follow. I said your whole name. Does everyone, when you follow people on twitch, do they always say your whole name.

00:42:58
stroopwafel26: EVERYONE knows you've used arch

00:42:59
<transcript>: I feel like I just went the extra mile.

00:43:00
smilingbig: KEKW

00:43:02
<transcript>: I read the whole thing. I could have just said 111.

00:43:02
<transcript>: i did the whole

00:43:04
<transcript>: I did the whole thing.

00:43:15
<transcript>: Could you eat fries at a steakhouse? Yeah. Luch, and I definitely have I don't feel great about it because it's just not very nutritious. Like if I'm going to go out to eat, I don't like to just eat fried potatoes.

00:43:15
<transcript>: but

00:43:17
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: @smilingbig you win the internet penis measuring award ^^

00:43:19
foobfoob: gh down?

00:43:25
<transcript>: But we've done that kind of thing, like when it's family and it's people that understand us. It's much easier to push back when it's like someone you don't know and they want to take you out or something. It's like, okay.

00:43:27
<transcript>: Cool.

00:43:28
arthurofbavaria: @the_real_enrico_pallazzo well thats why various other practices can be great, you can avoid 90%. most of said farmers dont use those practices because they dont care. Not even all vegan farmers do

00:43:29
<transcript>: We'll do that.

00:43:37
<transcript>: Hard to draw a distinct line in the sand? For where to stop? For veganism? Yeah. 100%.

00:43:37
<transcript>: we definitely

00:43:37
thdxr: is steak not vegan?

00:43:38
arthurofbavaria: horticulture is a weird science lol

00:43:40
<transcript>: We definitely started though, because of health benefits.

00:43:40
<transcript>: just like

00:43:47
<transcript>: Just like when you don't ingest animal products, you don't have to think about your cholesterol, for instance.

00:43:52
<transcript>: That's the thing in American, a lot of people have to think about we don't really have to think about it at all.

00:43:57
<transcript>: Where was that.

00:44:02
<transcript>: I like to eat Vegan while I code rust on arse. By the way.

00:44:08
<transcript>: That's like annoying. Bingo. Dax likes to talk about how annoying he is. So.

00:44:08
<transcript>: dax

00:44:12
<transcript>: Dax. He uses arch and neovim.

00:44:14
<transcript>: He eats keto.

00:44:20
<transcript>: Kind of similar like vegan annoying vibes, totally different diets but.

00:44:20
<transcript>: similarly

00:44:21
<transcript>: Similarly annoying.

00:44:21
<transcript>: oh

00:44:24
thdxr: Adam I literally just got on and you're talking about how I'm annoying

00:44:29
<transcript>: Oh, he has a whole list on Twitter. I can't remember all of them. It's too early for Twitter time, but there's, like, a whole list.

00:44:29
<transcript>: he's got

00:44:32
stroopwafel26: oh hey, I got a job offer but the pay is too low and now I kinda lost interest, how do I turn them down? i've never had to do this before

00:44:32
<transcript>: He's got 1012 things that are like, oh, he does cross it.

00:44:33
smilingbig: LUL

00:44:37
alongwithcris: nah gotta go KETO-VEGAN

00:44:40
<transcript>: We're just talking about dax. How annoying is he's probably going to show up now this is about the moment where he'll show up. When we're talking about how annoying he is.

00:44:41
looch94: I went vegan for a year as an experiment, I actually became pretty unhealthy.. higher cholestrol and felt tired all the time. But I think it was mainly because I felt so restricted with what I could eat so I would default to junk vegan food like fries

00:44:46
overra_dev: t3ggLove

00:44:47
<transcript>: Everyone knows I've used arch. Do you, though? Have I mentioned that I used arch? By the way, King Paul.

00:44:51
arthurofbavaria: @AlongWithCris kegan, or vegeto lol

00:44:53
<transcript>: Thank you for that. Follow. Thank you so much. Nax is here.

00:44:59
<transcript>: I just said we start talking about how dax is annoying, and he's going to show up.

00:44:59
<transcript>: okay let's

00:45:04
<transcript>: Okay, let's see get up down. Uhoh, that's why various other.

00:45:04
<transcript>: pract

00:45:10
vimcerf: @looch94 a lot of vegans eat too much pasta

00:45:12
<transcript>: Practices can be great. You can avoid 90%. Most of said farmers don't use those practices because they don't care. Not even all vegan farmers do.

00:45:17
<transcript>: Is steak, not vegan. Hey, dax horticulture is a weird science.

00:45:34
<transcript>: Let's see. Oh, hey, I got a job offer, but the pay is too low, and now I kind of lost interest. How do I turn them down? I've never had to do this before. I think you can just not accept the offer. If you haven't accepted the offer, I think you can just not accept it. You could send him an email and be like, listen.

00:45:35
arthurofbavaria: pasta is amazing lol

00:45:42
arthurofbavaria: gotta make your own tho

00:45:46
<transcript>: I don't want your job anymore. And it's nothing about you. It's all me. There's nothing you could do to make it better except for make it more lucrative. You could send an email like that. Probably.

00:45:52
arthurofbavaria: super easy and its way healthier ;)

00:45:54
privann: Just say that the salary don't fit your needs

00:45:56
<transcript>: Keto Vegan. That would be a Venn diagram. That would mean you eat very few things.

00:45:59
privann: in a email

00:46:02
<transcript>: Because I'm pretty sure dax could correct me. Pretty sure keto, without being able to eat.

00:46:05
privann: that proffessional and transparent

00:46:15
thdxr: there are keto vegans lol

00:46:22
<transcript>: I guess if you were keto, can keto, people. Dax, can you eat fruit? What is it you don't eat? I don't remember. I went vegan for a year as an experiment actually became pretty unhealthy higher cholesterol and felt tired all the time. But I think it was mainly because I felt so restricted with what I could eat. So I would default to junk food. Yeah, there's a lot of vegan junk food. More.

00:46:22
<transcript>: all the time

00:46:23
<transcript>: All the time.

00:46:24
thdxr: some fruits work but can't have a ton

00:46:30
alex_boring_228: hi

00:46:32
thdxr: lots of keto junk food too

00:46:39
manbravegg: @stroopwafel26 I would just say, I had a salary in mind and given the value I would bring to the company I feel that this offer is too low. Thank you for the offer and best of luck on your search for a candidate.

00:46:39
thdxr: full of seed oils

00:46:39
<transcript>: Companies keep making more cool vegan products. It's a trap. Don't do it. It's all terrible for you. Just like other food is terrible for you. Like avoiding processed foods is the goal. And the vegan thing is like, we have a lot of reasons why we do that.

00:46:43
<transcript>: But you could be plenty unhealthy and eat vegan.

00:46:55
<transcript>: It is not like a get out of jail free card because you don't eat animals. I would be interested to learn how your cholesterol was higher because you literally can't ingest cholesterol if you don't eat animals.

00:46:57
thdxr: I know so many unhealthy vegans

00:47:02
stroopwafel26: I did that, and now they're asking what I want to make, but I already lost interest :')

00:47:07
alongwithcris: Well like theres also the problem of the like for things like Almonds and avacados they ship in millions of bees that end up dying to flower the plants

00:47:10
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: @the_real_enrico_pallazzo Not sure i understood what you meant. There are no vegan farmers...just farmers...there's ranchers...poultry etc...a farmer grows vegetables...not talking about dairy industry

00:47:10
<transcript>: Your body makes cholesterol, but I don't think you could possibly raise your cholesterol. Someone can correct me, but I think from a nutrition science standpoint, my wife is really into this. I don't think it's possible to raise your cholesterol on a vegan diet because.

00:47:15
<transcript>: I think it's physically impossible. You could correct me if I'm wrong.

00:47:19
<transcript>: Keegan or vigto.

00:47:20
arthurofbavaria: @thdxr yea, especially the ones who eat lots of oil and processed foods :(

00:47:22
darrenbaldwin03: Hi Adam

00:47:26
<transcript>: A lot of vegans eat too much pasta. We don't eat much pasta in here. My wife doesn't like pasta. She doesn't really like grains at all.

00:47:26
<transcript>: pasta is amazing

00:47:30
darrenbaldwin03: how goes it?

00:47:36
<transcript>: Pasta is amazing. I do love pasta. Got to make your own super easy. It's way Healthier pravan is here. Just say that the salary don't fit your needs in an email. Yeah, that sounds like a.

00:47:36
<transcript>: professional way

00:47:38
<transcript>: Professional way to turn them down.

00:47:44
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Alex. Boring. Hi, how are you.

00:47:44
<transcript>: there are ket

00:47:50
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: @adamdotdev It's easy to raise it. You eat bullcrap like Margarine or other bad processed fats...fried in oil etc....and BAM ...cholesterol

00:47:55
<transcript>: There are keto vegans. Wow, some fruits work but can't have a ton. So we live off fruit. We're almost like fruititarians. Fruits. I mean, we eat a lot of vegetables, obviously.

00:47:59
<transcript>: But if we couldn't eat fruit or if we couldn't eat a lot of fruit.

00:47:59
<transcript>: it would not work

00:48:03
thdxr: I love fruit

00:48:06
<transcript>: It would not work for us. We get so many of our galleries from, like fruit, lots of keto, junk food.

00:48:06
<transcript>: yeah

00:48:07
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:48:09
33nasser: fruits are based

00:48:15
<transcript>: I would just say I had a salary in mind and give them that. Okay. You guys are talking full of seed oils. And there's so many unhealthy vegans. Yeah, it's very easy.

00:48:15
<transcript>: i mean

00:48:17
<transcript>: I mean, dax, you watch me eat.

00:48:17
<transcript>: like a box

00:48:21
<transcript>: Like a box of Vegan donuts at reinvent.

00:48:21
<transcript>: so

00:48:32
<transcript>: So there's that I did that. And now they're asking what I want to make, but I already lost interest. Just tell them you lost interest. I'm no longer interested in your organization.

00:48:36
manbravegg: @stroopwafel26 In that case I would just be direct  and say that at this time you have other offers that are more interesting at this time and that you are not interested in negotiating any further.

00:48:49
stroopwafel26: ok i will

00:48:52
<transcript>: There's also the problem of the like for things like almonds and avocados. They ship in millions of bees that end up dying to fly to the plants. Oh, no, yeah. It is hard in today's society, like, the world is so complex. And there's a lot of things that are screwed up for a lot of reasons and untangling it all. It's like, it's impossible to be.

00:48:52
<transcript>: purely ethical

00:48:53
<transcript>: Purely ethical.

00:49:04
<transcript>: Like you're going to accidentally be unethical in a million ways every day, and I don't know how to fix that, but you can at least do things that you know, you feel like you should do. I think that's the best we can do.

00:49:16
<transcript>: I don't get upset with people that don't make decisions like me for one thing, because I know it's complex and a lot of its environment and how you're raised and what's available and what you're used to and it's a lot of things.

00:49:16
<transcript>: i think

00:49:16
stroopwafel26: what's the best fruit?

00:49:19
stroopwafel26: go

00:49:21
thdxr: mango duh

00:49:24
33nasser: mangoes

00:49:26
manbravegg: Mango

00:49:27
arthurofbavaria: almonds suck anyway lol, they have tons of oxylates and taste like chalk hahaha

00:49:28
<transcript>: I think that's the main reason I like telling people I'm vegan is I feel like they think I'm going to shame them for not being vegan. And honestly, I have zero thoughts of that. There's not a single person that I look at and say, like.

00:49:28
<transcript>: they eat

00:49:30
<transcript>: They eat animals.

00:49:30
<transcript>: it's not that

00:49:31
<transcript>: It's not that.

00:49:33
stroopwafel26: mango is a solid choice

00:49:35
arthurofbavaria: thats just me tho

00:49:37
<transcript>: So I just want to get that out there. I'm Vegan. But I don't care if you're not. I really don't.

00:49:52
<transcript>: I'm not sure what you meant. There are no vegan farmers. There's farmers. There's ranchers, poultry, et cetera. Farmer grows vegetables, not talking about dairy entry, especially onto lots of oil and processed foods. Hey, Darren, what's going on? Where? Somehow we're talking about.

00:49:56
thdxr: I did continuous blood sugar monitoring and nothing spiked my blood sugar like a Mango. worse than ice cream or any dessert

00:49:58
<transcript>: Food a lot today. I still haven't written a line of code. We're talking about food. We talked a little about a religion.

00:50:00
<transcript>: Spirituality.

00:50:00
<transcript>: it's been

00:50:02
<transcript>: It's been an interesting stream.

00:50:02
<transcript>: no one

00:50:07
broccodev: the journey from astro & sst to vegan is a short trip

00:50:08
<transcript>: No one has won a macbook yet. So there's that it's going well, Darren. It's going well.

00:50:12
manbravegg: What's a line of code Kappa

00:50:15
manbravegg: ?

00:50:18
<transcript>: It's easy to raise it. You eat Bull crap like margarine or other bad processed fats, fried and oil, et cetera. And Bam cholesterol. But I don't think.

00:50:18
<transcript>: that's actually

00:50:21
<transcript>: That's actually going to increase your cholesterol is what I'm saying.

00:50:22
aisebaxp: I like how practical is your though process

00:50:25
<transcript>: Eating animals and animal products.

00:50:25
<transcript>: is the only way

00:50:32
<transcript>: Is the only way to ingest cholesterol like plant based foods if it's actually a plant based food.

00:50:32
<transcript>: cannot

00:50:34
<transcript>: Cannot contain cholesterol.

00:50:34
<transcript>: and your body doesn't produce

00:50:38
<transcript>: And your body doesn't produce more cholesterol based on your diet.

00:50:38
<transcript>: i don't

00:50:44
tsoutsou_proutsou: hey dude

00:50:58
<transcript>: I don't believe someone can step in with some real science and correct me. But my wife, literally for fun, watches like Dr. Greger on YouTube. And he just reviews like nutrition, science papers like scientists who are doing studies on nutrition. It's literally just videos of him going over the paper and explaining the insights. That's what my wife does for fun. No joke.

00:51:04
<transcript>: I love fruit. Me too. Dax. Fruits are based. I always forget NASA.

00:51:04
<transcript>: is bass

00:51:07
<transcript>: Is bass. Good or bad.

00:51:07
<transcript>: i'm still

00:51:07
alongwithcris: from health UK "Cholesterol is only found in foods that come from animals, there is no cholesterol in foods that come from plants. So, there is no cholesterol in fruit, vegetables, grains, seeds, nuts, beans, peas and lentils."

00:51:13
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: @adamdotdev straight from Google:  --------------------------- Stick margarine This process creates trans fat, which is even worse for you than saturated fat. Trans fat raises LDL (bad) cholesterol significantly – much more than saturated fat does.

<transcript>: I'm still getting up to speed on my Gen Z slang the other night at dinner. No joke. Me. My wife and our living nanny sat there and read on the Internet ginzi slang so we could get up speed. I learned some new words that I didn't know were a thing in that case. Okay, I will. What's the best fruit? What's the best fruit.

looch94: "About 85% of the cholesterol in a person's circulation system is manufactured by the liver and not directly from the cholesterol that you eat." this is the top result when I googled can you increase cholestrol without ingesting cholestrol

00:51:42
arthurofbavaria: your correct about cholestorol, but many fast food places cook their fries in oil that they cook meat in, so you get alot of the fat from the meat rendering into the oil, and that ends up in your fries. fast food fries arent really vegan

00:51:47
aisebaxp: This is the Google answer: "It's becoming increasingly easy for vegans to consume diets high in saturated fat, which can lead to high cholesterol"

00:51:48
<transcript>: Is bass good. It's a good take. Mango is definitely up there. We spend literally thousands of dollars on mango every year. I'm not even joking. We order from Miami Fruit. We order boxes of mango and sure, come at me. There's probably a lot of things wrong with that. Like shipping them across the country.

00:51:48
<transcript>: but we

00:51:50
arthurofbavaria: thats probably why their chol went up

00:51:54
<transcript>: But we don't live in South Florida, and we love fruit. So we do order a lot of fruit from Miami.

00:52:05
<transcript>: Yeah. So we ordered lots and lots of mangoes. We love all kinds of varieties of bananas. I think my sore bananas are one of my favorite fruit.

00:54:46
<transcript>: From Health UK. Cholesterol is only found in foods that come from animals. There is no cholesterol and foods that come from plants. So there's no cholesterol and fruit, vegetables, grains, seeds, nuts, beans, peas, and lentils. And then I guess the next follow up question, along with Chris, is, Does your body ever produce more cholesterol.

00:54:54
<transcript>: i'm pretty

00:54:58
thdxr: cholesterol is not well understood at all

00:55:01
<transcript>: I'm pretty sure you can at least check off you will have good cholesterol if you don't eat animal products. I'm pretty sure.

00:55:10
arthurofbavaria: @ManBraveGG reject almonds, embrace quinoa LUL

00:55:14
thdxr: a lot of the fears around it came from the anti fat movement from the sugar lobby

00:55:21
<transcript>: Rio enrico straight from Google Stick margarine. This process creates trans fat, which is even worse for you than saturated fat. Transat raises ldl cholesterol significantly, much more than saturated fat does. It also lowers hdl cholesterol, the good cholesterol that helps prevent allele from building up your arteries. So you're saying this article says.

00:55:21
<transcript>: if you eat

00:55:27
<transcript>: If you eat transats, it does raise your ldl cholesterol. That's very possible. I don't eat trans fats.

00:55:27
<transcript>: so i would

00:55:41
<transcript>: So I would recommend not that's a very bad sign of like it's junk food. If it has trans fats, like transats. In the 90s, people are trying to get rid of trans fats. That's how bad trans fats are even before anyone cared at all about what we ate.

00:55:41
<transcript>: based

00:55:43
<transcript>: Based is good.

00:56:03
<transcript>: Let's see 85% of the cholesterol in a person's circulation or circulation system is manufactured by the liver, not directly from the cholesterol they eat. Top result when I googled that can you increase cholesterol without ingesting cholesterol? You're correct about cholesterol. But many fast food places Cook their fries in oil that they Cook meat in. So you get a lot of the fat from the meat rendering.

00:56:03
<transcript>: into the oil

00:56:23
<transcript>: Into the oil, and that ends up in your fries. Fast food fries aren't really vegan. Yeah. We don't eat fast food. We don't really eat out. Not that we don't eat fast food. We just don't eat out because there's not a lot of, like in the ozarks, not a lot of options. We don't have a lot of plant based eating out options. If we lived in, like, La, we would be fat vegans because we would eat.

00:56:23
<transcript>: all kinds

00:56:26
<transcript>: All kinds of terrible things because they're readily available.

00:56:44
<transcript>: And we don't always have the willpower to not eat good stuff. Like good tasting stuff. This is a Google answer. It's becoming increasingly easy for vegans to consume diets high in saturated fat, which can lead to high cholesterol. I just learned something. So I learned today that you can have high cholesterol. As a vegan, I didn't know that was possible.

00:56:52

00:56:59
jikadayk20: first time here. Really like the clean and minimal layout

00:57:02
<transcript>: Okay. Here's. What? Maybe I misunderstood from my wife or from something I've seen or heard.

00:57:22
<transcript>: Whole food plant based diet. I don't think you could raise your cholesterol. I think if you eat a whole food plant based diet, you're probably not going to have to worry about cholesterol. And by whole food plant based. I mean, no processed foods. You just eat whole foods, whole plants, whole seeds, nuts, grains. That's what we try to do. We try to eat whole food plant based. Sometimes we fall off the wagon.

00:57:22
<transcript>: but

00:57:31
<transcript>: But if you're eating whole food plant based, I don't think you're ingesting any of those things that would raise your cholesterol. I don't think but I could be wrong.

00:57:38

00:58:45
arthurofbavaria: that is true, for me I like the carbs because I want the calories

00:58:47

01:01:57
<transcript>: We didn't have water with us because we're dumb. We didn't fill our waters or something. So we ran out of water. But we had a chiramoya, and we were just back and forth.

01:02:05

<transcript>: it's bigger

01:05:37
<transcript>: It's bigger than I thought it was. I thought it was £5. It was a mistake, but we have a 15 pound tub of peanut butter now, so we're not running out peanut butter for a while.

01:06:40
<transcript>: I literally said, I said, Tax is going to join now because we're talking about how annoying dax is. No, it came up because somebody asked if I was Vegan. And I was like, Well, dax is more annoying than me.

I'd like you to teach me how to ten X my development output. I guess zero output timestamp is still zero. I should probably write a single line of code. Then we could ten X that.

01:07:33
<transcript>: statistically

01:07:36
tung__lee: Thanks for nothings .

01:07:40
<transcript>: Statistically, it's more worth to say 50k for a guaranteed one on one call than gamble for a chance of Mac something. Something. Teach a man how to fish.

01:07:49
<transcript>: There you go. I can't promise you you'll get a macbook worth of value out of a phone call with me, but I appreciate it.

binajmen: It is happening >< Github is experiencing degraded performance. Copilot X is taking over ;D

01:08:43
<transcript>: My wife will think I'm nuts. Why are you taking the peanut butter to your office? Have you seen those Japanese mangoes where they cut off all the mangoes except for one per branch. And then it gets all the nutrients.

01:08:49
<transcript>: That's so cool. Oh, that sounds delicious. I bet it tastes so good.

01:09:02
stiefbroerikzitvast: hows the rewrite progressing? almost done?

01:09:03
<transcript>: Sakin just had an interview. Ceo asked me why I think I am worth X amount of money answered improperly. These kind of questions feel so weird? He asks why you think you're worth so much? So you had to tell him what you wanted as a salary.

01:09:03
<transcript>: and then

01:09:06
<transcript>: And then he asked you why you think you're worth that.

01:09:14

<transcript>: That one has divide Y, but it doesn't divide y.

01:11:38
<transcript>: Oh, wait.

01:11:41
<transcript>: Is this one? Is it this one.

01:11:50
<transcript>: Where is that line coming from? Is it coming from the right side of this one.

01:11:54

01:11:58
<transcript>: Oh, because oh, I see.

01:12:50
<transcript>: What answer can you say Besides supply and demand? Wait a minute. Are you just trying to confuse me? Dax, I feel like you just wrote that to confuse me because I felt like I was confused. And you just want to make me more confused. What answer can you say Besides supply and demand.

01:12:53
<transcript>: What.

01:12:59
<transcript>: Oh, the interview question. Okay, that makes more sense. I think I'm confusing myself.

01:12:59
<transcript>: couldn't

01:13:03
thdxr: what answer can you say besides supply and demand

01:13:08
<transcript>: Couldn't open PR. So join to watch Adam. There you go. Denillo. Github's down. Come hang out. We're not using GitHub. Where we're going? We won't need GitHub.

01:13:28
<transcript>: My brain is not there yet to be this confused axe. You're torturing me. Okay, divide y. So the problem here is I need to actually split it up. I don't know how I'm going to do this in a way that makes sense.

01:13:31
<transcript>: Because I have to arbitrarily.

01:13:31
<transcript>: put

01:13:35
<transcript>: Put them in. So if I did this.

01:13:44
mecoupz: adam should only be allowed to answer with 'yes' when dax asks a question

01:13:45
<transcript>: This feels so bad. This is the MLB box for so I guess at least it's just the MLB one. But this is going to look really weird.

01:13:51
<transcript>: I'm going to have to do this whole thing.

01:13:58
<transcript>: I have to do this whole thing.

01:14:00
<transcript>: Out here.

01:14:04
<transcript>: I'm going to just do, like the first row or something.

01:14:07
<transcript>: I hate this. I already hate it.

01:14:13
<transcript>: Set of rows, map.

01:14:15
<transcript>: This is going to be.

01:14:21
thdxr: I've never asked a question

01:14:22
<transcript>: Row here is going to be box.

01:14:22
<transcript>: score

01:14:26
<transcript>: Score Data linescore rose.

01:14:26
<transcript>: zero

01:14:28
<transcript>: Zero.

01:14:31
<transcript>: This is so ugly. Someone tell me to do this differently.

01:14:38
<transcript>: Where is column coming from? Oh, linescore, columns, oh, it's column, zero.

01:14:45
<transcript>: Okay. Undo. Undo. Undo. I'm not doing this. I'm not doing it that way. At least I'm not doing it that way.

01:14:48
<transcript>: I've never asked a question.

01:14:57
<transcript>: How would you do this? Someone tell me how would you do this? What I need is for. So I've got these columns.

01:14:57
<transcript>: right

01:14:59
<transcript>: Right. Let's do this.

01:14:59
<transcript>: i've got

01:15:02
<transcript>: I've got these columns. Here.

01:15:05
<transcript>: And I need to add.

01:15:21
<transcript>: A Div around the first one, a separate Div on the first one, and then a separate Div around the next nine of them. And then that's a separate Div. But how do I do that without it just being totally arbitrary? I guess it is just arbitrary.

01:15:21
<transcript>: it's just

01:15:24
<transcript>: It's just because it's baseball.

01:15:26
<transcript>: I guess.

01:19:31
<transcript>: ris

01:19:43
<transcript>: Risk way. I don't know if it's low risk, a low effort way to get into quantum stuff using bracket. It's an aws service where you can use like quantum simulators and stuff. I think you can even use real quantum computers.

01:19:43
<transcript>: add the

01:19:49
<transcript>: Add the index to your map. Yeah. I think that's what we're going to do, but I guess the question is.

01:19:49
<transcript>: so for the column

01:19:52
<transcript>: So for the column, we're going to add the index. The question is.

01:19:52
<transcript>: can i change

01:19:54
<transcript>: Can I change the style.

01:19:57
thdxr: it's high risk because it can create a black hole

01:19:57
<transcript>: Based on the index.

01:20:01
arthurofbavaria: its gonna be awhile before i get enoguh bucks to enter for the macbook lol

01:20:02
<transcript>: Is it that simple? Let's see list.

01:20:07
<transcript>: Look at me. I'm writing code, people look at me, look at me writing code.

01:20:12
<transcript>: Should really write more code on stream. I want to make sure this is sustainable.

01:20:17
<transcript>: Is my prettier ignore affecting this line as well.

01:20:25
<transcript>: Bummer if it is okay, first, flex one, divide one. So then we want to say, let's just say, bg, red, 500.

01:20:29
<transcript>: If index.

01:20:29
<transcript>: equals zero

01:20:30
<transcript>: Equals zero.

01:20:33
<transcript>: I'm just trying to get something down here.

01:20:33
<transcript>: okay

01:20:36
<transcript>: Okay, that's I.

01:20:39
<transcript>: Trying to put something in writing.

01:20:47
<transcript>: Okay, so that worked. Now, I just need to figure out how to style the right edge.

01:20:47
<transcript>: let's see

01:20:54
<transcript>: Let's see. This should be easy, should be easy. We just want border. We'll just do like border, right.

01:20:59
binajmen: TIL `class:list`

01:21:02
<transcript>: Border. And then, like that Gray color, E, four, E, four, E, four.

01:21:05
<transcript>: This music is kind of cool.

01:21:05
saltyohm: "should be easy" are some famous last words, in my experience lol

01:21:11
<transcript>: Who likes this music? I like it. Did I do it? I did it.

01:21:12
mecoupz: "this should be easy" ... famous last words

01:21:13
<transcript>: That was easy.

01:21:13
<transcript>: i just got to do

01:21:15
<transcript>: I just got to do it for this one too.

01:21:15
<transcript>: wow

01:21:18
<transcript>: Wow. That was way too easy.

01:21:28
<transcript>: Same as last words. Should be easy. Yeah. No, it really was, though. Ben admin class list is one of my favorite parts of astro. It's a dumb little thing.

01:21:28
<transcript>: like for it

01:21:36
<transcript>: Like for it to be one of my favorite things, but I love it. I love being able to do that. It's like class names, the library. But it's just built in.

01:21:36
<transcript>: i don't love that

01:21:39
<transcript>: I don't love that I have to do this stupid prettier ignore thing.

01:21:44
<transcript>: But I don't know how to handle the white space, otherwise.

01:21:44
thdxr: solidjs has class list

01:21:47
<transcript>: So if I is equal to zero or.

01:21:51
<transcript>: I is equal to ten. I think.

01:21:51
<transcript>: did i

01:21:55
aisebaxp: Why aren't you using the tailwind color or a custom setting?

01:21:58
<transcript>: Did I just nail this? Are we just done with this? We're done. No, I've got it. One too many. I equal to.

01:22:00
<transcript>: Nine.

01:22:01
thdxr: daily reminder to use solid

01:22:06
<transcript>: Now we should be good. Did it look at it.

01:22:11
<transcript>: Look at it. Let's just make sure it's picture perfect. Pixel, perfect.

01:22:13
<transcript>: Nailed it.

01:22:13
<transcript>: nailed

01:22:17
<transcript>: Nailed it. Didn't even miss a Pixel.

01:22:17
<transcript>: pixel

01:22:19
<transcript>: Pixel perfect if you will.

01:22:27
<transcript>: Daily reminder to use Solid. Yeah. Oh, it has classless, too. So did astro just copy solid.

01:22:34
<transcript>: Why aren't you using the tailwind color or custom setting.

01:22:42
<transcript>: I'm just copying what we have there today. And for some reason we didn't add this e four, e, four, e, four.

01:22:42
<transcript>: to our

01:22:47
<transcript>: To our theme. I don't know why, but I'm not going to ask questions. I'm just going to keep moving.

01:22:52
<transcript>: Too much to do, but yeah, we should probably clean that up.

01:22:57
<transcript>: Okay. So there it is. Baseball done.

01:22:57
<transcript>: hockey

01:22:59
<transcript>: Hockey was working. I think.

01:23:03
<transcript>: Did the bruins win.

01:23:06
<transcript>: Make sure.

01:23:06
puccababy: I have not got into Tailwind. Current project is MUI which is a whole... other headache.

01:24:23
<transcript>: let's go back

01:24:25
<transcript>: Let's go back to the baseball. And I just realized I should make sure.

01:24:25
<transcript>: it didn't eat the bottom

01:24:28
<transcript>: It didn't eat the bottom of the file.

01:24:28
<transcript>: because sometimes

01:24:29
<transcript>: Because sometimes.

01:24:29
<transcript>: tailwind

01:24:32
<transcript>: Tailwind Astro slash neovim.

01:24:32
<transcript>: eats

01:24:34
<transcript>: Eats the file.

01:24:37
<transcript>: Just so sad. But I have to deal with that.

01:24:44
<transcript>: Is it even Jam? Thank you so much for that. Follow. I appreciate that. Follow.

01:24:44
<transcript>: if you're new

01:24:51
<transcript>: If you're new here, save up some points. You can maybe not win a MacBook. You could win a MacBook.

01:24:51
<transcript>: but so far

01:25:02
<transcript>: But so far, no one has, which might mean that your odds are even better. You can do it twice every stream. Someone eventually is going to win that macbook, and I'm going to ship it to them, and it's going to be so exciting.

01:25:09
<transcript>: Because we're going to watch people do this every day and not win. And then eventually it's going to say, did win a MacBook.

01:25:09
<transcript>: i can't wait

01:25:12
<transcript>: I can't wait. I'm so excited for it. Honestly, I am.

<transcript>: Want to try and swing two? Can you actually win a macbook? You can usually hide.

01:26:19
<transcript>: it's

01:26:25
<transcript>: It's a very small chance, but you can actually win a MacBook. Someone is going to win a MacBook on this stream someday.

01:26:25
<transcript>: it's

01:26:29
thdxr: I'm so annoyed twitchcon is in Vegas

01:26:29
<transcript>: It's a 0.1% chance which might be too high, it might.

01:26:41
<transcript>: just

01:26:43
<transcript>: Just Anywhere. Just not Vegas.

01:26:57
<transcript>: Oh, Hello? Shrew. You're going to go to twitchcon. Oh, thank you. Dax, please go to twitchcon. I don't want to go to, like, two tech conferences. And dax not beat it either one of them. But I don't know if I can go to React. Miami. It's just so soon.

01:26:57
<transcript>: and my

01:26:59
dnbull: I don't think twitch con will be on the east coast lol

01:27:04
dnbull: will ever be *

01:27:07
<transcript>: And my wife is not mentally prepared for me to leave, and I don't know if we can do a family trip that quick, but we would like to take our kids to the beach. My little one has never been to the Beach.

01:27:17
<transcript>: Twitchcon will never be on the East Coast. Bummer, how about the midwest, though? Let's bring twitchcon to the midwest. The Ozarks.

devinda_me: programming conf @ beach

01:27:39
<transcript>: Adam Con. There we go. Okay. I need to get back to connecting to postgres because that's actually my goal today is to connect to postgres. Let's see.

01:27:47
<transcript>: The problem is, I think you might hate this. This might be an awful thing for me to do, but I'm thinking about.

01:27:47
<transcript>: not

01:27:56
<transcript>: Not doing the data proxy in ssd. I'm thinking about just doing it in the console. Don't at me, but I really am considering it because.

01:27:56
<transcript>: we have

01:27:59
<transcript>: We have this one database. Well, two databases.

01:27:59
<transcript>: i could just set up

01:28:01
thdxr: yeah do it in the console

01:28:14
<transcript>: I could just set up a proxy manually and then just hit the proxy. Do it in the console. Thank you. It just feels like I'm doing all this work to for what? To have part of our infrastructure, codified and infrastructure as code. The rest of it is not.

01:28:14
<transcript>: it just

01:28:16
<transcript>: It just feels like I'm wasting my time.

01:28:17
mecoupz: beer conf @ beach is better

01:28:28
<transcript>: Chicago, the mccormick City. That sounds fun.

01:28:28
<transcript>: chicago

01:28:32
<transcript>: Chicago is closer to me than most of the other places.

01:28:37
<transcript>: Programming conference greater than the beach. I agree.

01:28:40
<transcript>: Do it in the console.

01:28:40
<transcript>: beer comp

01:28:49
<transcript>: Beer. Comp at beach is better. I'm a fan of that. It's too annoying to import. Yeah, it just is. This is just too much. So we're going to just do this. We're going to get rid of.

01:28:49
dnbull: beach is overrated

01:28:50
<transcript>: This.

01:28:56
<transcript>: We're going to get rid of instance. Metadata, all that all of this.

01:28:56
<transcript>: get out of

01:28:58
<transcript>: Get out of here.

01:29:00

01:29:09
<transcript>: what is

01:29:11
<transcript>: What is all this stuff.

01:29:14
<transcript>: So these are proxies. Okay.

01:29:14
<transcript>: so

01:29:17
saltyohm: i was trying to think of a baseball pun for you purging all that code lol

01:29:20
<transcript>: So this though I should not comment out that should be real.

01:29:25
<transcript>: I guess the API, but I'm not even using the API.

01:29:32
<transcript>: Okay. So that's a bunch of stuff I can get rid of.

01:29:32
mecoupz: dax is probably sweating right now when adam starts deleting code :D

01:29:36
<transcript>: Cool. Let's just add a data proxy, then.

01:29:43
<transcript>: Beach is overrated. I was trying to think of a baseball pun for you purging all that code.

01:29:47
<transcript>: Dax is probably sweating right now when Adam starts deleting code.

01:29:50
<transcript>: Dax has to clean up my messes.

01:29:55
<transcript>: Did you guys hear that.

01:29:55
<transcript>: anybody

01:30:00
<transcript>: Anybody hear that on Stream? My kids jumped out of bed and it made me jump.

01:30:05
<transcript>: Okay, we're going to do this. We're going to go to aws, console.

01:30:09
<transcript>: We're going to go here.

01:30:11
<transcript>: Stat. Muse.

01:30:13
<transcript>: Aws, console.

01:30:17
<transcript>: Actually stat me. Yeah. This one right here.

01:30:24
<transcript>: Don't.

01:30:30

<transcript>: okay

01:30:31
<transcript>: Okay.

01:30:35
thdxr: SST charges per line of code

01:30:38
<transcript>: We're going to go to RDS.

01:30:42
<transcript>: Ssc charges per line of code. That's awesome.

01:30:51
<transcript>: Okay, so we're going to do Mothra stage first, we're going to create a proxy. I've never actually created a proxy. I'm going to see how hard this is.

01:30:51
<transcript>: engine

01:30:54
<transcript>: Engine Family postgres.

01:30:56
<transcript>: Proxy identifier.

01:31:01
<transcript>: Authora saging.

01:31:05
<transcript>: This 1 hour, 30 minutes.

01:31:11
<transcript>: Sure.

01:31:14
mecoupz: AWS Hero: i never created a proxy ... 🤔

01:31:14
<transcript>: My first stage. There we go.

01:31:14
<transcript>: connection

01:31:17
<transcript>: Connection pool. Maximum connections.

01:31:17
<transcript>: spec

01:31:30
<transcript>: Specify the maximum allowed connections as a percentage of the maximum connection level of your database 100%. For example, if you have set the maximum connections of 5000 connections, so sign 50% will allow you to proxy create up to 25 connectors. We're going to say 100%.

01:31:30
<transcript>: wait am i

01:31:31
<transcript>: Wait. Am I.

01:31:31
<transcript>: but am i

01:31:33
<transcript>: But am I no.

01:31:39
<transcript>: I'll do 90%.

01:31:39
<transcript>: because

01:31:44
<transcript>: Because of the existing apps need to connect outside of the proxy. I don't want to hose them.

01:31:52
<transcript>: Feature is currently unavailable. The reader endpoint is unavailable. That's fine.

01:31:58
kiwifromearth: kiwi lime

01:32:02
<transcript>: Additional target group information connection borrow timeout. I don't know what that is. I don't care. Identity and access management role. Okay, let me think about this.

01:32:04
thdxr: we all know Adam is a scammer

01:32:06
<transcript>: Me, coops. Eight of his hero. I never created a proxy.

01:32:06
<transcript>: i don't use

01:32:08
<transcript>: I don't use RDS.

01:32:08
<transcript>: i don't

01:32:17
<transcript>: I don't use rds people. I'm a scammer, but I don't use rds. So why would I ever have created a proxy.

01:32:20
<transcript>: Let's see. I guess I should probably create this and then take a break.

01:32:20
<transcript>: i wanted to

01:32:26
thdxr: heroes don't ask why, they just act

01:32:27
<transcript>: I wanted to eat my lara bar, but I should probably finish this because it might take time to stand it up. I don't know. Maybe.

01:32:31
<transcript>: Identity and access management role? Do I just want to create a new role.

01:32:33
<transcript>: Or.

01:32:44
<transcript>: Secret Manager Secrets. So, is it going to use a separate way of connecting to the database than the existing thing? Maybe.

01:32:57
<transcript>: I am authentication. You can use im authentication to connect to the proxy. In addition to specifying database credentials, choose how you want to use im authentication with this proxy. The choice applies to all secrets usage associated with the proxy.

01:32:57
<transcript>: required

01:33:01
<transcript>: Required. So don't use database credentials. That kind of sounds nice.

01:33:11
<transcript>: That sounds kind of nice. Could I get that to work, though? How would I connect to the proxy? Oh, yeah, because I am. I would use the astro site. Yeah. Okay.

01:33:18
<transcript>: No. Then I couldn't connect in dev. How would I connect in dev without database, credentials.

01:33:26
<transcript>: Heroes don't ask why they just Act.

01:33:29
<transcript>: It's funny.

01:33:34
thdxr: uhhh

01:33:34
<transcript>: Okay. I was wrong. My brain is not ready for this. I need a break.

01:33:34
<transcript>: it's time

01:33:36
<transcript>: It's time.

01:33:40
<transcript>: To eat my lara bar.

01:33:44
thdxr: my brain not ready either

01:33:45
<transcript>: I hope you all have something to say because.

01:34:25
<transcript>: So I have mixed feelings about aws certifications.

01:34:28
<transcript>: On the one hand I have them all.

01:34:30
<transcript>: On the other hand.

01:34:32
<transcript>: I don't recommend.

01:34:32
<transcript>: that everyone

01:34:40
<transcript>: That everyone go out and get a bunch of AWS certs. I would say people who value AWS certs.

<transcript>: Made Grove, made desk mat. Okay, so we chose this secret.

01:52:54
<transcript>: Client authentication type. We'll go with the default.

01:52:56
thdxr: oo Ihave a grovemade also

01:52:58
<transcript>: I am authentication. Do I need this to be required.

01:52:58
<transcript>: yeah

01:53:05
<transcript>: Yeah, it can be required because I can still hit it from my Dev environment. My credentials will still be allowed. I think.

01:53:05
<transcript>: requ

01:53:10
<transcript>: Require tls. Do we want to require tls? I don't know.

01:53:22
<transcript>: Subnets. Define IP ranges that the database can use in the vpc you selected. I guess it just shows them all of them. I guess that's okay. I'll just say it's accessible from all subnets.

01:53:26
<transcript>: Okay additional connectivity.

01:53:26
<transcript>: vp

01:53:28
<transcript>: Vpc Security group.

01:53:28
<transcript>: we do need

01:53:30
<transcript>: We do need to do this.

01:53:33
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:53:38
<transcript>: We'll make a new security group, create a new.

01:53:50
<transcript>: Aging db proxy. I don't care about naming things, okay? Create proxy. Here we go.

01:53:54
<transcript>: Oh, dax has a Grove mate as well.

01:54:10
<transcript>: Confirmed Grove Made is the mat of choice for watch dev streamers. I'm going to go with that. Oh, we're sorry. Your request to create a db proxy. What must enable tls when I am author. Okay, well, then why didn't you just check it for me.

01:54:16
<transcript>: Okay. Create proxy. Here we go. Security Group Art exists. Yeah, it does.

01:54:29
<transcript>: Because you created it. Come on, now, come on, now, mothra, mothra. I got a P. Mothra, mothra? Well, now it's not even.

01:54:33
<transcript>: Oh, this is so painful.

01:54:33
<transcript>: it created

01:54:34
<transcript>: It created it.

01:54:34
<transcript>: and now

01:54:38

andom: how big a of leap would it go do TypeScript after working with python

02:00:52
<transcript>: You guys are funny.

02:01:03
<transcript>: Grasp is here. Good morning. Vacation was great. It was fantastic. It was a small one, just like for four days. But it was nice. It was a nice little break.

02:01:03
<transcript>: our boys just

02:01:05
zharkaa_: hello

02:01:10
<transcript>: Our boys just the winter months start to wear on us. The boys start to get stir crazy. They don't get to play outside enough.

02:01:17
morocodes: @Andom Ish? It's not a small adjustment, but it also won't be a massive shift either

02:01:18
vimcerf: @Andom depends if you use type hints in python or not

02:01:19
<transcript>: And going on a little vacation is a nice reset. We come back home. They appreciate everything they have at home again. Like it's new. It's good.

02:01:24
morocodes: ^ also true

02:01:29
<transcript>: I'm big into iec like a big fan of infrastructure as code. In this case we're talking about an application that already exists in aws account.

02:01:29
<transcript>: without

02:01:42
<transcript>: Without much in the way of iac. I mean, it does have so it's elastic beanstalk, I think. But like all these the database that was created, all this stuff exists, and it just already exists. It's not codified.

02:01:42
<transcript>: in

02:01:57
<transcript>: In some kind of infrastructure as code. And I was trying to import everything I needed to create the data proxy in my ssc stack. And it just started feeling like, Why am I doing this? There's literally one database. I can just create a proxy and start using it. So that's what I'm doing.

02:02:03
<transcript>: How big of a leap would it be or would it go from typescript after working with.

02:02:03
<transcript>: python

02:02:08
<transcript>: Python. So you've worked with python moving to typescript how big of a leap.

02:02:08
<transcript>: pretty big

02:02:10
<transcript>: Pretty big leap pretty deep.

02:02:21
<transcript>: Have you only ever worked with python? You have no other exposure to any of the C drive languages, no C Sharp or java or anything like that.

02:02:21
<transcript>: because

02:02:37
<transcript>: Because it is quite a bit different. But I would say depending on how much python you've done, I feel like you've been python developer for five years. Then you probably have enough of the mental framework around how to accomplish things with programming that it wouldn't be a big deal. But if you're pretty new to programming.

02:02:37
<transcript>: and

02:02:43
andom: c# briefly on school and now python for 3 years

02:02:44
<transcript>: And you've only worked in python. The switch over to typescript is a pretty big syntactical difference.

02:02:47
<transcript>: It just looks different than Python.

02:02:47
<transcript>: and then

02:02:51
<transcript>: And then you got to deal with all the differences in the javascript ecosystem and.

02:02:53
mecoupz: c# and TS is at my current employer my stack, will start a new job soon which is TS only

02:02:56
<transcript>: There's just a lot in the javascript world that sucks.

02:02:57
morocodes: {}:

02:02:59

02:03:03

<transcript>: saint

02:03:06
<transcript>: Saint St. Peter.

02:03:06
<transcript>: thank you

02:03:07
andom: @Andom I do use type hints

02:03:07
<transcript>: Thank you for that. Follow.

02:03:20
<transcript>: Hello zarka ish it's not a small adjustment, but it also won't be a massive shift either, since if you use type hints in python or not. Oh yeah. So you're going from a dynamic language.

02:03:20
<transcript>: to

02:03:22
<transcript>: To a Typed language.

02:03:22
<transcript>: that

02:03:30
zxshan: I'm back :) Sun's out, feel great

02:03:33
saint_pyotr: yoo i didn't know you made statmuse, that's awesomee

02:03:42
<transcript>: That's going to be a big change. Yeah, there's some stuff they're going to learn, but you'll be fine. I mean, you'll figure it out. C Sharp briefly, unschool. And now python for three years. So Typescript is very much like C sharp. If you've got a C Sharp background, they're made by the same people. Even. How about Microsoft? How about Microsoft being the typescript people? The.

02:03:42
<transcript>: vs

02:03:44
<transcript>: Vs. Code people.

02:03:48
<transcript>: The Chad gpt, People, GitHub.

02:03:53
<transcript>: Like somehow Microsoft became the most important tech company.

02:04:00
saint_pyotr: MS good for devtools, kinda bad for user facing products

02:04:01
<transcript>: After it seeming like they would just fall into oblivion because no one cares anymore about desktop operating systems.

02:04:03
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:04:03
<transcript>: they navigated

02:04:09
<transcript>: They navigated the last decade pretty well, haven't they? I feel like dax would have opinions about Microsoft.

02:04:11
lenoksa5215: wonder when they will f*ck everything up

02:04:16
<transcript>: C. Sharp and ts is at my current employer. My stack will start a new job soon, which is ts only.

02:04:22
morocodes: Dax? The Arch Nerd? Never xD

02:04:23
<transcript>: You do use type int. Okay, so that helps. I'm back Sun's out. Feels great. Welcome to Chat St.

02:04:23
<transcript>: pointer

02:04:33
<transcript>: Pointer. Can I call you St. Pointer? I didn't know you made stamp use. That's awesome. Yeah. So started set me as 2014. So eight years ago.

02:04:33
<transcript>: nine

02:04:37
<transcript>: Nine years ago, I've been saying, eight years, is that nine years.

02:04:48
<transcript>: Turns out time keeps going the years they keep it ticking ticking on by I don't know is that a song? Did I just make that up.

02:04:48
<transcript>: i have to

02:04:49
<transcript>: I have to.

02:04:49
<transcript>: sift now

02:04:54
<transcript>: Sift now permanently in my chat. It's a permanent fixture. It's among us now.

02:04:54
<transcript>: i have

02:05:02
mecoupz: microsoft is good at buying good companies or investing in them (openapi, github and so on) and bad at their own stuff (visual studio, windows, office and the list goes on)

02:05:07
<transcript>: I have to sift through people who did not win a macbook. Every time I want to read chat, I got to sift through all the people who didn't win Ms. Good for devtools, kind of bad for user facing products. Yeah, I agree.

02:05:07
thdxr: lol

02:05:08
privann: This macbook thing is a scam

02:05:08
crintuscodes: Not switchinig to TS from python, but I can confirm it's really weird using something else, ie. I'm using Dart now

02:05:10
privann: 200%

02:05:13
<transcript>: I remember when we used azure at the very beginning of sap muse before we moved over to AWS.

02:05:13
<transcript>: and

02:05:14
<transcript>: And.

02:05:14
<transcript>: the log

02:05:16
andom: The new job would have c# and TypeScript. Turned down this offer before but I'm reconsidering because realizing I don't like being at my current job

02:05:17
thdxr: I got started in the MS world! c#, asp, etc

02:05:22
spotmonk: how many times can I not win a macbook?

02:05:23
thdxr: always thought their devtools were amazing

02:05:24
<transcript>: The login system, like Microsoft authentication is the worst thing in the world. At least it used to be. It was so bad. Just like how confusing it was.

02:05:24
<transcript>: do we have

02:05:35
<transcript>: Do we have a team account or a personal account or an organization account? What it's like? You can't figure out how to log in just to get into your azure account every time you need to get in.

02:05:40
<transcript>: Linux. Thank you for that follow. I appreciate your follow.

02:05:49
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. So you're not betting on Microsoft to continue this heater that they're on.

02:05:53
sudo_says: MS feels like it's software and dev cycle should be better than it is.

02:05:55
mecoupz: i felt exactly the opposite 2 years ago: azure was more structured and aws was like node_modules folder (black hole)

02:06:02
morocodes: Honestly Visual Studio was/still is pretty amazing for what it is, it just has a long legacy that kept it from making the jump VSCode did

02:06:09
<transcript>: Microsoft is good at buying good companies or investing in them. Openai github and sohan and bad at their own stuff. Visual Studio, Windows Office and the list goes on interesting. So what about I guess they did typescript in vs. Code. Those are very popular. They did okay with those. Those are their own stuff, right? This macbook thing is a scam. It's not a scam. It's just a very small.

02:06:09
<transcript>: percentage

02:06:19
<transcript>: Percentage very tiny chance not switching to ts from python, but I can confirm it's really weird using something else. I. E. I'm. Using Dark now Dart.

02:06:27
ttbishop: your penis tiny or is it realistic ?

02:06:27
zxshan: @thdxr thought your tweet earlier about how we need to compare React/Remix/Next to MVC frameworks now like Phoenix quite on point.

02:06:39
<transcript>: The new job would have C sharpened typescript turn down this offer before, but I'm reconsidering because we're don't like being at my current job. I've heard a lot of that people getting antsy in their current jobs. I got started in the Ms world C sharp ASP same dax. Same how many times can I not win a macbook two times every stream. You cannot win a macbook two times every stream.

02:06:41
<transcript>: But one time.

02:06:48
<transcript>: You could not win a macbook and win a macbook on the same stream. You've get two chances every time, and someone's eventually going to win.

02:06:50
2dorkstv: MS is just so bound by the historical choices they've made. It's hard to really revolutionize something and still stay backward compatible with everything you did before

02:06:56
<transcript>: Always thought their dev tools were amazing. Yeah. Vs. Like Visual Studio. I always felt like it was pretty slick. Back in my C sharp days.

02:06:56
<transcript>: ms feel

02:07:07
<transcript>: Ms feels like It's software and dev cycle should be better than it is. I feel exactly the opposite. Two years ago, azure was more structured and aws was like node modules, folder, black hole.

02:07:16
<transcript>: Honestly, Visual Studio still is pretty amazing for what it is. It just has a long legacy that kept it from making the jump vs. Code. Did.

02:07:17
<transcript>: What.

02:07:17
<transcript>: tt bi

02:07:20
<transcript>: Tt Bishop what.

02:07:23
<transcript>: Where did that question come from.

02:07:25
ttbishop: the chance to win :D

02:07:26
<transcript>: Is it realistic? What.

02:07:28
<transcript>: What was that question.

02:07:28
<transcript>: thought your

02:07:29
ttbishop: is it really tiny ?

02:07:33
ttbishop: AHAHAHAHA

02:07:37
grasp5533: the face zoom was so good

02:07:39
morocodes: I went on a weird journey. C++ Game Dev -> ASP NET -> C++ -> Python -> C# -> *smogashborg of TS, IaC langauges, and Rust*

02:07:39
<transcript>: Thought your tweet earlier about how we need to compare React remix next to mvc frameworks. Now that like Phoenix quite on point, dax is always on point. He's always on point with his takes.

02:07:39
<transcript>: ms just

02:07:48
lenoksa5215: ttb go for a walk :D

02:07:48
<transcript>: Ms. Just so bound by the historical choices they've made, it's hard to really revolutionize something and still say backward compatible with everything you did before.

02:07:48
<transcript>: that

02:07:55
<transcript>: That makes sense. I mean, they've been around so long, they've got a harder job than most. Oh, the chance to win.

02:07:55
<transcript>: i got

02:07:57
<transcript>: I got you.

02:08:03
<transcript>: That was a good one. That was a good one. You're better than.

02:08:05
<transcript>: The what is it.

02:08:05
<transcript>: burn

02:08:10
<transcript>: Burn. Ai burnt roasted by AI. You're better than it. They should give you a job.

02:08:17
morocodes: C# Is close to my heart though tbh, especially with the awesome stuff they've been doing. I hope they manage to board the WASM train

02:08:19
ttbishop: I learnt that in junior school :D

02:08:23
<transcript>: The face Zoom was so good. Oh, you know what it's like once a stream, that it nails it. And it's worth it. Like, I keep it around because one time, every stream, it'll Zoom in at the perfect moment. That makes it feel like a movie.

02:08:31
<transcript>: And that's all for the rest of the stream. The rest of them will be terrible. It will just Zoom in when I hold up my cup and stuff.

02:08:42
<transcript>: Went on a weird journey. C Plus Plus game Dev ASP net C Plus plus python, C Sharp Schmargage board of tsic languages and rest. Wow Moro.

02:08:42
<transcript>: you

02:08:43
ayushsharma: okay to post a funny tech video

02:08:44
<transcript>: You have been on a journey.

02:08:47
<transcript>: Aman, thank you so much for the follow.

02:08:47
<transcript>: did i say

02:08:49
<transcript>: Did I say your name wrong.

02:08:53
<transcript>: I had a teammate named Ahmed.

02:08:53
<transcript>: did i

02:09:01
<transcript>: Did I do it right? And I had to. I really wanted to learn to do the guttural sound because I just talked to him like, every day, and I didn't want to every day be like, Hey.

02:09:01
<transcript>: i'm mad because

02:09:07
<transcript>: I'm mad because I'm like a Missouri hillbilly living the ozarks American.

02:09:07
<transcript>: i didn't want to do

02:09:10
ahmad7428: yes the second one is correct !

02:09:15
<transcript>: I didn't want to do that every single day you work with somebody, you want to get it right. So I practiced a lot. Ahmed. Did I do it? Did I do it? Second one is correct.

02:09:16
lenoksa5215: typical murica teammate

02:09:19
ahmad7428: yup

02:09:21
<transcript>: Yes, look at me. I'm getting it. I'm getting cultured.

02:09:21
<transcript>: time

02:09:26
<transcript>: Time took over a walk ttb TDB time to first bite no. Ttb.

02:09:26
<transcript>: time

02:09:34
kiwifromearth: kiwitime

02:09:39
morocodes: yah, talk a walk adam

02:09:43
morocodes: take*

02:09:45
lenoksa5215: it was ttb=ttbishop :D

02:09:46
<transcript>: Time. Go for a walk. Are you telling me I should go for a walk? Or you're saying you're going for a walk? Lenoxa which one? C sharp is close to my heart? Because you might convince me. You might convince me I need to go for a walk. I was thinking about how a walk would be nice today and I don't know what ttb stands for, but if you're threatening me, then maybe I really should. I don't know. C Sharp is close.

02:09:46
<transcript>: to my heart

02:09:52
<transcript>: To my heart, though, especially with the awesome stuff they've been doing. Hope they managed to board the wasm train.

02:09:55
<transcript>: Learnt that in junior school.

02:09:55
<transcript>: i believe

02:09:57
<transcript>: I believe that.

02:09:57
<transcript>: okay

02:10:01
<transcript>: Okay to post a funny tech video. Sure. I don't know if we're going to look at it right now.

02:10:01
<transcript>: we kind of

02:10:02
fragaverage: IM SO LATE

02:10:06
<transcript>: We kind of did this the react to things for a bit.

02:10:09
<transcript>: And I should probably do actual work.

02:10:09
<transcript>: let's see

02:10:20
<transcript>: Let's see. Also. Welcome to Chat aquit Ahmed. I have to really try Ahmed. Am I over trying? Am I going too far with it? Welcome to chat.

02:10:23
<transcript>: Typical America, teammate.

02:10:23
<transcript>: yeah

02:10:24
morocodes: @FragAverage banned

02:10:24
<transcript>: Yeah. Sorry.

02:10:24
<transcript>: kiwi time

02:10:26
cowfacedev: @FragAverage we remembered your 50k channel points...

02:10:30
<transcript>: Kiwi time. Kiwi's here, talk and walk at him. Oh, take a walk at him. Okay.

02:10:41
<transcript>: Oh, TT Bishop got you. It was ttb TT Bishop got you. Frank, you are so late. But it's okay. We forgive you. Thank you for showing up.

02:10:41
mecoupz: c# is cool, i like it

02:10:48
<transcript>: You're always welcome. You can now redeem your two chances at a macbook if you'd like.

02:10:51
<transcript>: I'm just going to greet people with that now.

02:10:51
<transcript>: welcome

02:10:53
fragaverage: I didn't get the notif... again!

02:10:53
<transcript>: Welcome. Let's get them out of the way. Let's go.

02:10:59
<transcript>: Somebody's going to win someday it's going to be cool. Didn't get the notification again. That's so weird.

02:11:04
<transcript>: So weird. C. Sharp. Is cool. I like it.

02:11:04
<transcript>: does anyone

02:11:06
rene_p8: Hey Adam

02:11:09
ttbishop: you have to give us the percentages

02:11:11
fragaverage: Alright, you said it!

02:11:20
<transcript>: Does anyone else feel like Microsoft kind of got, like, a weird reputation for a while, like 15 years ago, ten years ago, where it was like, kind of like, taboo, like, Microsoft is so dumb. And like, if you like, T sharp, it was like you were shunned.

02:11:23
morocodes: I mean, it was an earned reputation tbh

02:11:24
fragaverage: well, RIP

02:11:25
<transcript>: You may remember that. Did I imagine that.

02:11:29
<transcript>: Renee is here. What's going on? Renee.

02:11:29
<transcript>: you have to give us

02:11:32
morocodes: didn't help that .NET Fx was/is windows only

02:11:33
<transcript>: You have to give us a percentages. It's a .1%. Chance.

02:11:41
ttbishop: 1/1000 that's a good odd

02:11:42
<transcript>: I'm being honest with you all up front, there's a .1% chance that you will win a Macbook if you redeem that win a Macbook thing.

02:11:43
morocodes: I say as a (now) MS fan

02:11:43

cowfacedev: microsoft has a bad reputation for their lsps in the neovim community.

02:11:45
<transcript>: It was earned. Reputation. To be honest.

02:11:53
andom: isnt it 0.01%?

02:11:56
<transcript>: Rip didn't help that Net fx was is Windows only. Yeah. I felt like that's when it was. It was when I was shifting into Web Dev.

02:11:56
<transcript>: and

02:11:56
cowfacedev: mainly for python server..

02:12:05
<transcript>: And it felt like there was a lot of stigma around Microsoft, because it was so locked into, like, you're just building stuff that works on Microsoft machines.

02:12:05
<transcript>: and

02:12:09
<transcript>: And there's this whole new world out there that I wanted to build for the browser so anybody could use it.

02:12:13
<transcript>: Brain dev null. Thanks for the follow.

02:12:22
<transcript>: One out of a thousand. That's good. Odd. Yeah, it might be too good. Honestly, wait. Zero 1%. Is that what I said? Is that one in a thousand.

02:12:23
mecoupz: they were bad then steve ballmer walked on stage with his "developers developers" dance but they're not so bad since satya took over

02:12:25
<transcript>: Oh, jeez, is it.

02:12:33
ttbishop: 0,1 ? or 0.01 ?

02:12:37
<transcript>: 1% would be one in 100. Did we do 0.1% or zero 1%? Someone tell me, frag, it was zero one. I'm so sorry. I did not mean to misrepresent the chances. I just didn't remember.

02:12:37
<transcript>: it's zero

02:12:40
morocodes: @cowFaceDev Because they're proprietary/tied to VSCode right? I didn't realize how many of the core ones had those restrictions

02:12:42
fragaverage: SCAMMER, AGAIN!

02:12:43
<transcript>: It's zero 1%. So not one in a thousand. It's one in 10,000.

02:12:43
<transcript>: which

02:12:46
<transcript>: Which is still maybe too many MacBooks.

02:12:58
ttbishop: EA loot box

02:13:00
<transcript>: Macbook Pro is a great incentive to say in farm points. You know, Lenoxa, I gave one away on Twitter, and it ended up in somebody's hands that really needed it. And I feel like if I do this kind of stuff where there's just a random chance.

02:13:05
dmmulroy: I feel like if M$ waited ~5 years later to release f# it would have caught on way more

02:13:21
<transcript>: The randomness shall guide us to someone in need. So someone is going to win it. And they're really going to need a macbook. And I'm going to feel very good that they want it. That's what I'm trying to manifest into the world. I don't know. Can I say that manifests it into the world? Does that mean like, I believe something? I don't believe something about that. I use those words. Microsoft had a battery reputation for their.

02:13:21
<transcript>: lst

02:13:24
<transcript>: Lsts in the neo vim community.

02:13:27
<transcript>: Oh, they have a battery position, so they still do okay, fair.

02:13:27
<transcript>: but

02:13:27
morocodes: It's like the cat distribution system

02:13:32
<transcript>: But I feel like there's less of a stigma than there was like ten years ago.

02:13:43
<transcript>: Yeah, it's 0.1%. Sorry for misrepresenting. Mainly for python server. Okay. Oh, yeah. Doesn't the guy the guy that made python work at Microsoft. Now I think.

02:13:43
<transcript>: they were

02:13:48
lenoksa5215: well I was on windows my whole life, then started dualboot linux but nvidia gpu and linux... its a mess

02:13:55
<transcript>: They were bad. Then Steve bomber walked on stage with his developers. Developers Dance, but not so bad since Sapya took over. Yeah, I think that's probably a lot of it, right. They actually start embracing Open source and doing a lot of different things.

02:13:55
<transcript>: it's

02:14:00
<transcript>: It's zero 1%. T Bishop zero one.

02:14:02
<transcript>: One in 10,000.

02:14:04
<transcript>: Because.

02:14:04
<transcript>: they're proprietary

02:14:10

I don't want anybody feeling like I'm trying to rip them off of channel points. I don't get anything if you spend channel points, by the way, I get nothing out of that. Let's see.

saint_pyotr: god streaming code sounds ultra fun, but I feel like I'm too shy lol 👉👈

02:21:37
endingwithali: 🔫CHANNEL

02:21:42
<transcript>: Noted. I used to adore zaml, but I'd take HTML CSS over at any day nowadays. Yeah, it's probably better nowadays. I don't think is xaml still a thing? I guess people still probably write xaml. I guess like wpf app is still a thing, aren't they.

02:21:43
cowfacedev: basically, it is a discord for those people who don't want to manage their own discord.

02:21:49
morocodes: XAML is unforunately still a thing. WPF and Avalonia

02:21:49
<transcript>: Two accounts. I also have a secret second Twitter account that I have that no one knows the name of that I used to.

thdxr: oh great more cringe content from adam

02:22:21
<transcript>: Let's see. God streaming code sounds ultra fun, but I feel like I'm too shy. Saint, I'm going to be creating some stuff to try and help people who have that feeling move past it and try it. It's not for everybody. You might try streaming and hate it and be justified in not wanting to do it anymore. But you might start streaming and find out that you love it, which is what happened to.

02:22:21
<transcript>: me

02:22:23
morocodes: Maybe I'll start streaming again 🤔

02:22:27
<transcript>: Me and I would love for more people to get that experience. So, Yeah.

02:22:37
<transcript>: I'm going to make some stuff. I'm probably going to make a YouTube video. Maybe I'll make a YouTube video this week about this. I got to get back on the YouTube thing. Can we get an irc server instead of discord.

02:22:41
<transcript>: The gun. Allie's got the gun out. Channel.

02:22:46
<transcript>: Basically, it is a discord for those people who don't want to manage their own discord. Yeah, that was really the original thing.

02:22:49
<transcript>: It's like Twitter with allie. That's funny.

02:22:49
<transcript>: the original

02:22:53
<transcript>: The original thing was like I didn't want to have my own discord server and then.

02:23:06
fragaverage: How do I send doubts in chat

02:23:09
<transcript>: They just kind of ended up making one because you got to have a discord server. You want to hang out off of twitch, you got to have one. But what if you don't want to have your own and you just want to have a presence in, like, a shared community one. That's what Watch dev is. It's not like there are no, like, monetization.

<transcript>: Okay. As someone who just learned, someone who just started learning and just want to watch to learn. Welcome to Watches of yes, lesa, that's the whole point is for it to be a place for people who are learning from developers on twitch, people who are wanting to eventually stream on twitch. It's like all those people, the people who hang out.

02:23:55
<transcript>: in twitch

02:24:01
<transcript>: In twitch chat, and they don't ever want to stream, but they just want to hang out with developers who are on twitch great place to do it. That's the point.

<transcript>: Did I just say I didn't want money? Well, I mean, like, you guys are subscribing on twitch. You should get a perk in the channel, but I'm not getting anything out of you guys being in that channel. You know what I'm saying? We're not monetizing this server. There's no entity for watch. Dev. This is not a delaware C Corp. And I have no plans.

02:25:46
<transcript>: So many x's. It's very obscure name. Guess I am not a mod no more. Oh cowface. Yeah, no, I frag and calface. You guys were mods in my discord server. I only removed the mods because it felt weird since you're just mom's in my server and we got to figure out how to do it. I was going to write some code.

02:25:57
<transcript>: That was like keeping everyone's moderators in sync and having roles in the discord server for every streamers moderators. I haven't done it, and I haven't talked to dax about it. If we want to do that.

02:25:57
<transcript>: but that's why

02:26:10
uberrick: @thdxr LUL

02:26:17
<transcript>: But that's why I removed the moderator. It just felt weird because it's like giving special privileges to people who are my moderators. But you're not a moderator for whoever else acorn. And should you moderate. I don't know. You know what I'm saying? You know I love you guys. Stop it. You know I love you. It's very obscure name. Guess I am not. Okay, sir, you have a lot of camera angles. I do.

andreaslorozco: nah nah, my bad... what IS that touchpad?

02:26:54
<transcript>: To maybe spend less time using my mouse. So I thought if I had a trackpad instead, I would use my mouse less. I don't know if it worked, but that's what I was going for.

02:35:26
crintuscodes: You should do a work count from chat. "NOT" will be the highest count LUL LUL

02:35:26
<transcript>: So this is an end point and presumably I can just hit it if I have.

<transcript>: L to the defenders. You guys are funny. Adam is giving away more. Max, how much money do you have? Sock? I am giving away another Mac. You have a chance to win it. Ooh, sock. Try. Do you have points? Sock, have you tried redeeming the macbook thing.

02:36:04
<transcript>: you might

02:36:11
<transcript>: You might be the one sock. I just have a few about you. You might be the winner. Welcome to Chat five.

02:36:29
<transcript>: What's the F.

02:36:29
<transcript>: did my stream

02:36:31
thdxr: I did so much research into this

02:36:31
daneoshiga: there's pgcli.. I use dbeaver, that works with multiple databases

02:36:31
fyvel8000: HeyGuys

02:36:34
<transcript>: Did my stream cut out? Look at all these l's.

02:36:34
<transcript>: i

02:36:36
thdxr: currently using Beekeeper

02:36:40
morocodes: F for all the Ls

02:36:45
<transcript>: I did so much research into this. Oh, you did, dax, I just need a little cli to test this with right now. Currently using beekeeper. Are you making that up? I feel like you might just be making that up.

02:36:48
<transcript>: F for all the l's.

02:36:48
<transcript>: wow

02:36:53
devagrawal09: L

02:36:53
morocodes: I think you need to raise the redeem a lil, even with the low chance xD

02:36:53
uberrick: FYI Adam coded the competition so might not actually work LUL

02:36:55
sockthedev: do we keep redeeming? how does this work?

02:37:00
mattmancodes: It's a scam

02:37:04
devagrawal09: no

02:37:08
isitevenjam: tableplus:: https://tableplus.com/  GUI tho, not sure about cli

02:37:08
<transcript>: Wow. You guys are really coming in with the redeems. Look at you people. Now that you've seen the code, you feel like you trust it. You're willing to give up your points. I think you need to raise the redeem a little, even with the low chance. Well, more of the goal is not to give one away like every stream. The goal is to give one away, like every month. Ish it's not a scam? Do we keep redeeming? How does the fork.

02:37:08
<transcript>: you get two

02:37:14
coolpantstv: I think now that you showed the code you should reset the redeem lockout

02:37:14
<transcript>: You get two chances. Every stream FYI Adam coded the competition, so might not actually work.

02:37:17
<transcript>: It's also true. No, it's going to work.

02:37:17
<transcript>: it's just i

02:37:17
devagrawal09: knowing the code makes me trust it lerss

02:37:20
<transcript>: It's just I can't give away every stream.

02:37:22
sockthedev: lol

02:37:25
<transcript>: If your goal is to see one right now, well, then maybe.

02:37:25
<transcript>: but maybe

02:37:28
securibee: @thdxr PridePog

02:37:30
vapor__dev: im at 16k adam bucks lets goooo

02:37:40
<transcript>: But maybe not. So should I use? Knowing the code makes me trust it less. It's funny. Also. Welcome, dev. I miss you, dev. I was gone for a few days. I think now that you showed the code, you should reset the redeem lockout. No, I don't think that's how it works.

02:37:40
fyvel8000: what's your keyboard?

02:37:46
fragaverage: Having a higher chance, but only enabling it once per month for a stream would be awesome

02:37:47
<transcript>: Allen is here. I'm at 16k Adam Bucks, let's go, let's go. My keyboard is a mode 80.

02:37:47
<transcript>: i'm trying to go back

02:37:55
<transcript>: I'm trying to go back up and see what dax said. He uses beaver. Something. What was it? Beekeeper? Is that a real thing.

02:37:55
<transcript>: beekeep

02:37:59
<transcript>: Beekeeper postgres. I guess it is.

02:38:00
funkysetiz: it is

02:38:04
<transcript>: Sql Editor and Database Manager for your dreams of your dreams. Okay.

02:38:04
<transcript>: i'm going to

02:38:05
aisebaxp: I have to see the testing for that redeeming code

02:38:06
<transcript>: I'm going to try it.

02:38:16
funkysetiz: 14 days trial

02:38:18
thdxr: I'm waiting for someone to buy the 1:1

02:38:22
<transcript>: Let's see what's your keyboard having a higher chance, but only enabling it once per month for a stream would be awesome. So that's interesting. Frag, I thought about that. What if it was like, you just don't know when it's going to be available, and it just randomly makes it available for like a minute at a time.

02:38:22
<transcript>: and

02:38:32
<transcript>: And it's like a one in ten chance or something. I don't know. Or one in 100. Maybe. I don't know. I could do that. Then you guys would just be having to pull up the little redeem thing all the time.

02:38:37
<transcript>: Waiting for someone to buy the one on one. Nobody wants to have a one on one call with me. I don't know.

02:38:45
uberrick: I keep getting scammed out of points

02:38:48
<transcript>: Okay. I have to see the testing for that redeeming code. There's no tests, no tests around here. Installer or portable. We're going to go installer.

02:38:48
<transcript>: but mac

02:39:28
thdxr: adam created this macbook scheme because people were getting too close to the 1:1

02:39:32
<transcript>: I hope you're not messing with me. You wouldn't do this, would you.

02:39:39
<transcript>: I created the macbook scheme. People were getting too close to one on one. I'd rather just.

02:39:39
<transcript>: give somebody a

02:39:39
fragaverage: I've got the 50k already LUL just want to make the most use of your time

02:39:40

02:40:07
<transcript>: this thing

02:40:14
vapor__dev: can u buy points with cash

02:40:15
<transcript>: This thing is behind a vpc and it shouldn't work for anybody else. It should work for me, though.

02:40:18
<transcript>: Right.

02:40:18
<transcript>: i'll have to

02:40:20
<transcript>: I'll have to open up.

02:40:26
<transcript>: The security group like the vpc to allow my IP address in but other than that.

02:40:26
<transcript>: enable

02:40:29
<transcript>: Enable ssl. I don't know. Maybe.

02:40:32
<transcript>: Oh, no, I don't know what those things are.

02:40:32
thdxr: I use the paid version of beekeeper but there's a free version

02:40:42
coolpantstv: @thdxr we get it ur rich

02:40:45
<transcript>: Just going to open up my thing.

02:40:49
<transcript>: Table plus is probably better, but not for Linux.

02:40:52
uberrick: Need to start doing first try polls to gamble our points

02:40:56
<transcript>: Use the paid version. Can you buy points with cash? You cannot. Alan. You cannot.

02:41:04
<transcript>: I had 5000 points when I joined the stream. Really? You just got to like, immediately. You got 5000 points.

02:41:06
thdxr: I'm following Adam's angle of being rich on social media

02:41:10
<transcript>: You created.

02:41:19
<transcript>: Virus on it to make some macbook Chance 100%. That's really funny. You made me laugh. Decks. Five o. Thank you so much for that. Follow. I appreciate it.

<transcript>: because

02:41:27
vapor__dev: @vapor__dev SeemsGood

02:41:27
coolpantstv: @adamdotdev can I venmo you for adam bucks? $100 for 1000?

02:41:33
<transcript>: Because your trial expires in two weeks. It's not going to work because I shouldn't be allowed through the vpc. I don't think.

02:41:36
<transcript>: Unless did it work.

02:41:39
<transcript>: No, it's not working right.

02:41:51
<transcript>: Error establishing a connection. Okay, so it's not going to work. Let's open up traffic to let's see. Vpc. Let's do this.

02:41:58
<transcript>: Subnets. I don't know what subnet. It's in.

02:41:58
<transcript>: let

02:42:09
<transcript>: So find out what subnet this thing lives in.

02:42:17

02:43:49

02:47:31
<transcript>: So if I could do it from the terminal, I could have like a credential session.

02:47:37
thdxr: if you want to use iam credentials you need to generate a token or something with this aws rds generate-db-auth-token -

02:47:38
<transcript>: Like in the shell, right. So do I need a cli tool? Someone answer me.

02:47:40
coolpantstv: didn't realize I got tickets to the GUN SHOW

02:47:42
coolpantstv: damn

02:47:48
<transcript>: Someone tell me if you want to use Im credentials, you need to generate a token or something with this AWS RDS generate DB off token. Oh really.

02:47:52
thdxr: that token is the pw

02:47:52
<transcript>: Okay. Let's try that. Well, let's try that.

02:47:54
thdxr: I don't remember exactly

02:47:55
<transcript>: Let's do it.

02:47:58
<transcript>: That token is the password. Okay.

02:48:02
<transcript>: But does it work with a database proxy as well.

02:48:06
luco_mo: @adamdotdev witch keycap you are using on your mode eighty?

02:48:06
saltyohm: let's give it a whirl

02:48:12
thdxr: BUT I prefer using the bastion approach, too annoying to keep it working

02:48:13
<transcript>: Luko. Which keycap I'm using.

02:48:13
<transcript>: dracul

02:48:15
treasonist: someone needs SST

mr_robinsonson: Do you have info on your mouse/trackpad there?

02:48:25
<transcript>: Dracula, gmk dracula keycaps. I prefer using the bash and approach. Yeah, too annoying to keep working. Okay, let's do the bashing approach. Someone needs SSD.

02:48:38
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat, Mr. Robinson. Do you have info on your mouse trackpad? There? The mouse trackpad is just an Apple. What do they call it? Apple Smart Pad or something? No, that was a terrible guess. Apple.

<transcript>: Oh, I have to actually set up the real password.

02:51:57

02:53:33

02:53:48
<transcript>: so

02:53:55
<transcript>: So the idea with macbooks was that I feel like developers can use a macbook to create amazing things in this world.

<transcript>: Once you win it, we can negotiate right now. The plan is to give someone a macbook, and I'm assuming whoever wins it is going to want a macbook over adele. Just assuming Ally, you dm'd me on Twitter. Should I read it on Stream, or would it be best to read it later after stream? Will it ship with sst preinstalled.

02:56:15
<transcript>: Yes, of course. No, it won't because it'll be brand new in a box. And I won't ever touch it.

<transcript>: Am I getting a little ahead of myself? Could I take a sharpie and just write my name on the top of the laptop? I don't even have a signature, so it'd just be like me writing my name with my terrible handwriting.

02:59:18
<transcript>: It was basically me being sorry for being obnoxious, also chatting about streaming, looking for advice I would love and maybe a one on one. Hey.

02:59:30
mr_yan19: Hold up! You don't have a signature?

02:59:39
<transcript>: So pay for someone chat GPT API usage is going to destroy us all anyway. I do have thoughts on AI. I do.

02:59:42
<transcript>: I don't think it's going to destroy us.

02:59:47
<transcript>: I do think the pace is crazy.

03:00:13
<transcript>: a lot of us

03:00:20
<transcript>: A lot of us. It's changed software development already and feels like we're just getting started. I don't know. It's pretty crazy.

<transcript>: Averagelli for Delber in Brazil is sixty K a year. And Mac Pro is half of your annual income. Oh, my goodness.

03:01:57
<transcript>: well

03:01:59
thdxr: just don't do that

03:02:02
<transcript>: Well, I would love to send one to Brazil, then that would be amazing to know that.

03:02:11
<transcript>: It's a hard thing to acquire in Brazil. What's the current tech stack you're migrating from? You know, Mr. Robinson? Great question. It's a Phoenix.

03:02:11
<transcript>: so

03:02:18
fyvel8000: @funkysetiz Ikr had to wait 6 months to get one

03:02:22
<transcript>: So elixir and Phoenix is kind of like the server generated side, and then it still embeds, like a React app in the middle of it. It's kind of a hodgepodge. That's kind of why we're rewriting it.

03:02:26
<transcript>: Okay. I keep saying I'm going to catch up. I keep not catching up with chat.

03:02:26
<transcript>: you have been

03:02:28

03:02:28
<transcript>: on ai

03:02:36

03:02:37
thdxr: fear uncertainty and doubt

03:02:48
<transcript>: You don't have a signature. I mean, I kind of have a signature. I just don't use it much. I don't have to write much. Takes out of a week to write a tab component. So likely you should be worried about AI. It's true.

03:02:48

03:03:27
securibee: What stack are you migrating to?

03:03:32
<transcript>: I didn't skip strep. Okay, listen, I did not skip a single step. The problem with the arch instructions is.

03:03:32
<transcript>: you're on a document

03:03:36
<transcript>: You're on a document in the wiki that's, like, here's how to install arch. And you're like, I can do this.

03:03:42
zol0: do you have 20/20 vision? something tells me you do

03:03:45

03:03:46
mecoupz: what chair are u using adam? it's that half height thing right?

03:03:52
<transcript>: Every single word is like a link to another page you have to read. And I can only read so many pages before I'm just going to check out and think like, I probably got that step done. That's what happened. Okay. Fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Oh, I have been sledding. Yeah. So it's funny.

03:03:59
<transcript>: I feel like a bunch of stuff came out with AI at once, like the plugins for Chat, gbt, or for whatever.

03:03:59
<transcript>: the plugins

03:04:12
<transcript>: The plugins. It can run ffmpeg now all this stuff came out like day two of me drinking coffee after months of no coffee. So I'm already all anxious with the caffeine shakes. And then I read all this stuff and I'm like.

03:04:12
<transcript>: no it's the end

03:04:15
endingwithali: dont drink coffee

03:04:18

03:04:18

devagrawal09: do you drink straight black

03:04:41

03:04:47
thdxr: how do you control the source zoom? can you do that through the obs api

<transcript>: We're deploying everything with SST.

03:04:59
sockthedev: ok, we need to call out when we think adam has been drinking coffee.

03:05:14
<transcript>: Let's see, installing arch is like putting together ikea furniture. I mean, I've actually successfully put together some ikea furniture. I have never successfully installed arch without arch installed. Hey, maliro, was it you that's coming tomorrow? Are you coming to our coffee date.

03:05:24

Like the best stuff on reddit ends up on Twitter. They're all fake. I don't believe a single one of them is real. I just don't. Somebody has some crazy story. It's just too crazy. They go too far. They've got to.

03:28:57
devagrawal09: that sounds like a roast

03:28:59
<transcript>: Going to be sick. Being on the same time zone can make those early morning memes.

03:29:02
<transcript>: It's funny.

03:29:04
<transcript>: Okay.

03:29:05
devagrawal09: "let me know when you finally decide to touch grass"

03:29:09
<transcript>: I'm going to do this now. I guess this is all pretty sensitive work. I shouldn't show you.

03:29:16
vapor__dev: @thdxr wut u mean

03:29:16
trash_dev: lmao when i was on east coast for xmas i was EXTRA early @thdxr

03:29:34
thdxr: @vapor__dev we RT'd it so it should be fine but if you start a tweet with an `@` it won't show it to people

03:29:43
tobs_on_twitch: I've been to two tech conferences but I was too shy to talk to anyone

03:29:46
<transcript>: So I'm going to be decrypting secrets. It's just going to be fuzzy the whole time. I'll just have the screen fuzzied. That's not fun content. Nobody wants to see that. And I normally stop at ten. So I just kind of like, gilted, you all 30 minutes today. I started late, ended on the same time.

03:29:46
<transcript>: been to two

03:29:53
vapor__dev: @thdxr WutFace

03:30:06
<transcript>: Been to two tech conferences, but I was too shy to talk to anyone. You got to have somebody there, you know, tobbs. So you got to go to a tech conference, but have somebody there that you already know. And you just hang out. I hung out with dax, that it ran the entire time. And that way, I just knew, like, at least I'm hanging out with dax. I don't care if we don't meet anybody else. At least we're hanging out. And then Allen was with us. And we just.

03:30:14
mecoupz: alrights its 5pm, i'm out. now its family time 👋

03:30:16
<transcript>: Stayed in a few different spots and met a bunch of people. It was a lot of fun. It would be hard, though. If I went by myself, I would meet no one. I would just like, stand in the corner.

03:30:16
<transcript>: my only

03:30:22
<transcript>: My only adventure is twitchcon will let you know, but I'm trying to move cross country at the same time. Yeah, that's probably not happening.

<transcript>: it's okay

03:30:26
badloop: which tech con you going to?  i'm looking for one for this year

03:30:27
<transcript>: It's okay. I'll just come help you move trash. How about that? That'd be a bonding experience.

03:30:42
<transcript>: Moving sucks. So bad. It's 05:00 p.m.. I'm. Out now. Sam's. Time. Cme. Coops, I'm out as well. It's been fun. Hey, dax, are you streaming? Can I just raid you? Which tech Con are you going to looking for one this year? So I'm thinking about going.

03:31:33

03:31:54
devagrawal09: i have a free ticket to react miami

03:31:57
<transcript>: Dev. You're the only one I haven't met already, but.

03:31:57
<transcript>: i

03:32:06
<transcript>: I bet there will be other people going, you have a free ticket. Oh, is it? Is it like are tickets sold out? Is it too late to get a ticket? If I don't have a ticket.

03:32:08
<transcript>: Can I can I get one.

03:32:12
<transcript>: Anybody know.

03:32:12
<transcript>: i'll consider

03:32:13

03:32:26
vapor__dev: i'll be staying in the serverless villa

03:32:30
<transcript>: I'll never travel for React. Yeah, that's kind of how I feel that it's hard, trash. It's hard to be like, yeah, react. Miami. I don't even want to use React anymore.

16:21:56
adamdotdev: test

16:38:51
<transcript>: Out.

17:10:55
<transcript>: Check, check.

17:11:25
<transcript>: Hey, can you hear me.

17:11:25
<transcript>: cool

17:11:31
<transcript>: Cool. Sorry. I just didn't look at the clock. I've been planning on this all day. It's like I have a call today.

17:11:34
<transcript>: And then inevitably, I forget.

17:12:37
<transcript>: My brain.

17:12:37
<transcript>: what

17:12:39
<transcript>: What is a gi.

17:12:40
<transcript>: gift

17:12:41
<transcript>: Gift.

17:13:10
<transcript>: i think

17:13:10
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:13:12
<transcript>: I think last week.

17:13:17
<transcript>: The open AI Progress, the stuff that came out with plugins.

17:13:22
<transcript>: in chat

17:13:22
<transcript>: I mean just executing python directly.

17:13:32
<transcript>: In Chat gpt. That stuff like, I don't know. It feels like it's moving very fast. I guess the plugin thing I did start thinking, like, what would a Stamp use plugin look like? And could that get us more.

17:13:37
<transcript>: Inbounds from people using Chat. Gbt that ask anything related to sports.

17:13:51
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:13:51
<transcript>: i think

17:14:01
<transcript>: I think the plugin thing is interesting with Chat gbt if you think that I don't know what is the percentage chance that Chat gbt does dent Google's market share.

17:14:01
<transcript>: in that case

17:14:10
<transcript>: In that case where it does, then we definitely need to have a presence like Google is pretty pivotal for us. Or it's pretty crucial, right. In terms of the traffic.

17:14:20
<transcript>: And I guess when I look at the Chat Gbt plugin system, it's just like you describe an api to Chat gbt.

17:14:31
<transcript>: And it just does the rest like it handles all the language stuff. So I don't even know if our existing apis that we service like the front end with would be what you would give.

17:14:39
<transcript>: and

17:14:39
<transcript>: To Chad gvt in a plug and snare. I don't know if it'd be better to expose apis that just fetch data about sports.

17:14:56
<transcript>: And let the language side just be chat gbt or do you explain to it that it can I'm sure you could explain to it that it can send natural language queries for sports answers to this endpoint and it will do that. I would guess it would work. I don't know.

17:15:02
<transcript>: Yeah. The lang Chain thing. Yeah.

17:15:12
<transcript>: Maybe. Now I'm just thinking, like, maybe.

17:15:12
<transcript>: some of

17:15:22
<transcript>: Some of the like trying to figure out a stat muse way to leverage all this crazy llm stuff is like a different domain entirely. Maybe it's like a spike.

17:15:22
<transcript>: of like

17:15:32
<transcript>: Of like how could satin use some of this stuff? Whether it's one of the Open, like not Chat gbt, but one of the Open models, llama or whatever.

17:15:32
<transcript>: is there

17:15:39
<transcript>: Is there a way for us to experiment? And maybe it's better just to do it with a different domain. I don't know if anyone has thoughts.

17:15:57
<transcript>: Well.

17:15:59
<transcript>: I think.

17:17:56
<transcript>: So, eli, I want you to correct me if this is not how you're thinking, but I guess where my head's at is.

17:17:56
<transcript>: one

17:17:58
<transcript>: we've definitely

17:17:58
<transcript>: One.

17:18:09
<transcript>: We've definitely got to just deliver. We've got this huge momentum and all this traffic from Google. And I think some percentage of the people that do all these searches on Status would pay for a subscription.

17:18:09
<transcript>: to have

17:18:19
<transcript>: To have I don't know something on top of that. I think that's like we don't want to miss that for chasing AI stuff. But I think the thing with AI right now that scares me just because.

17:18:19
<transcript>: these huge

17:18:27
<transcript>: These huge breakthroughs are in language understanding. And it just freaks me out that either Google.

17:18:27
<transcript>: that source of

17:18:35
<transcript>: That source of Google traffic is going to change over the next five years. And it's going to be like, everybody's just asking, Chat gbt now.

17:18:35
<transcript>: or

17:18:36
<transcript>: Or.

17:18:36
<transcript>: it's basically

17:18:40
<transcript>: and langu

17:18:40
<transcript>: It's basically just like, could we just completely get upended because of this revolution.

17:18:44
<transcript>: And language processing, AI stuff. It's kind of like our thing.

17:18:44
<transcript>: but

17:18:51
<transcript>: But every time we talk about this, I come back to we are a lot of other things, too. Stat muses. More than just.

17:18:51
<transcript>: natural langu

17:18:55
<transcript>: Natural Language processing. But it feels like a scary time.

17:19:01
<transcript>: To have a huge strategic part of us be that when it's being.

17:19:03
<transcript>: So offended right now.

17:23:50
<transcript>: We're getting.

17:24:29
<transcript>: A good thing.

17:29:24
<transcript>: Because they didn't have.

17:32:30
<transcript>: To relate.

17:33:19
<transcript>: so

17:33:19
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:33:38
<transcript>: So on a few of those things kind of responding to them. Rapid fire. I guess the first thing when I saw the plugin stuff last week and just saw it like running Sfmpeg commands in chat gpt and like chaining together these search queries on the Internet, I just felt like immediately open AI is going to just dominate this market.

17:33:38
<transcript>: and

17:33:41
<transcript>: that kind of

17:33:41
<transcript>: And I just feel like they're so far ahead.

17:33:49
<transcript>: That kind of stuff. I don't know how they're not just like the biggest company ever. And Microsoft owns it. I guess it is.

17:33:54
<transcript>: So I guess that does concern me for the Google.

17:34:00
<transcript>: The big giant pipe we have of people coming from Google every day.

17:34:00
<transcript>: in

17:34:07
<transcript>: In terms of rolling our own, I guess I don't think we have that skill set. I mean, we could try to learn how to do that kind of stuff.

17:34:07
<transcript>: and i mean there's a lot of

17:34:09
<transcript>: And I mean, there's a lot of information out there.

17:34:35
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't know.

17:34:35
<transcript>: i think

17:34:39
<transcript>: that google

17:34:39
<transcript>: I think the thing that's scariest to me is just losing.

17:34:43
<transcript>: That Google pipe like if the world did change a lot in the next few years.

17:35:03
<transcript>: the search

17:35:03
<transcript>: I mean, like everyone joked about it immediately or not joked all the people on Twitter, the alarmists were like, Google's dead. It's official. Like, Chad gbt is going to take over the world. I think that's pretty extreme. But if there's even, like, a chance that it could be like, yeah, like you said, 30% of the market. I don't know that's the kind of stuff that freaks me out is.

17:35:06
<transcript>: The search traffic changing.

17:35:36
<transcript>: So I don't know as it relates to bing. I don't think bing has anything with plugins in it yet. I think the plugin stuff is like brand new in beta. I mean you can apply to be like I've applied to make a stat muse one.

17:35:43
<transcript>: I guess I don't know how it relates to bing, but I know.

17:35:43
<transcript>: we want to have

17:35:52
<transcript>: We want to have a sat mes plug in for sure, because presumably that's a way to say, like, sports questions. Hey, here's a plugin for that.

17:36:01
<transcript>: And they do reference like, I think it does the whole reference links for the information it got. So it's like the perplexity thing.

17:36:37
<transcript>: It is kind of surprising to me, like Google, with all the resources in the world and had this lead that had the Google brain team or whatever all this stuff they had in terms of brain power for getting ahead on this stuff. How did they let this happen? And then bard comes out and it's terrible. I just don't understand how they got.

17:36:37
<transcript>: caught

17:36:39
<transcript>: Caught flat footed.

17:36:48
<transcript>: Interesting.

17:37:26
<transcript>: It's just going to spit stuff out.

17:37:53
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:38:41
<transcript>: I saw somebody ask it if it had been shut down and it said yes, like bard was shut down by Google for something. Something like it went into this very Google answer about why they shut it down.

17:39:32
<transcript>: That's funny.

17:46:11
<transcript>: Yeah.

17:46:11
<transcript>: by

17:46:12
<transcript>: By the way.

17:46:16
<transcript>: It's going to be like toward the end of this week, but.

17:46:16
<transcript>: casey

17:46:27
<transcript>: Casey's going to Florida for like a volleyball camp. So I'm going to have the boys into this week and into next week. So I'm still going to be working. I don't know if I'm going to stream. I'm probably just going to.

17:46:27
<transcript>: be

17:46:32
<transcript>: Be a little more fluid with my schedule. It's not going to be the standard times.

17:46:38
<transcript>: Yeah, this Week. Wednesday. Thursday is great.

17:46:38
<transcript>: and then

17:46:49
<transcript>: And then, yeah, next week would be more fluid. Like, my schedule is just going to be a little more weird. I'm going to be like, keeping the perlo is going to be here. So we're going to have our I mean, we're still going to have our nanny, but anyway.

17:46:52
<transcript>: Cool.

17:46:52
<transcript>: see you guys

17:46:53
<transcript>: See you guys.

17:52:08
<transcript>: Hey, can you hear me.

17:52:24
<transcript>: Whoa.

17:52:29
<transcript>: What is happening.

17:52:51
<transcript>: Hey, can you hear me.

17:52:56
<transcript>: Can you hear me.

17:53:08
<transcript>: Oh, I have pushed to talk on.

17:53:11
<transcript>: Can you hear me now.

17:53:15
<transcript>: Hang on.

17:53:25
<transcript>: I might have overheated a camera or two somehow.

17:53:35
<transcript>: Yeah, because it's the only one that's working that's weird. Hang on.

18:25:15
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

18:25:19
<transcript>: I need to come up with goals.

18:25:28
<transcript>: Ten K twitch followers. Yeah. I'm at like 3600 or something. I get about 50 a day.

18:25:28
<transcript>: it's

18:25:35
<transcript>: It's eerily similar every day. It's like I don't know why that's the case. I mean, I guess it's about how long you stream stream for 4 hours.

18:25:46
<transcript>: I mean, what is that, a week? If I stream five days a week, that's like 250.

18:25:50
<transcript>: So 500.

18:25:50
<transcript>: thousand a

18:25:51
<transcript>: is that

18:25:51
<transcript>: Thousand a month.

18:25:54
<transcript>: Is that a nice round number.

18:25:56
<transcript>: feels

18:25:56
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:25:59
<transcript>: Feels good. Okay.

18:26:06
<transcript>: But then what'll happen at 10,000? I'll just feel empty inside. I'll have no more goals.

18:26:06
<transcript>: sorry

18:26:08
<transcript>: Sorry.

18:26:13
<transcript>: Okay. There's not very many of those, right.

18:26:18
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:26:18
<transcript>: the software

18:26:22
<transcript>: have

18:26:22
<transcript>: The software and debt. It's like automated and Prime.

18:26:24
<transcript>: Have tons of followers.

18:26:24
<transcript>: who

18:26:27
<transcript>: Who else? I mean Theo.

18:26:32
<transcript>: Oh Yeah.

18:26:32
<transcript>: just

18:26:37
<transcript>: Just all growing the pie. That's what they say? Growing that pie.

18:26:41
<transcript>: Oh, sorry. Yeah. You do your thing. I'm going to do my thing.

18:27:00
<transcript>: I'm gonna have two encoders going, oof, this is gonna be beefy.

18:27:04
<transcript>: It's gonna be intense.

18:30:54
<transcript>: Is that playing for you.

18:30:56
<transcript>: Okay good.

18:32:07
<transcript>: Okay.

18:32:12
<transcript>: And comment those lines. I think I already uncommented them. Let's see, where was that? Here.

18:32:16
<transcript>: Yeah, I already uncommented.

18:32:16
<transcript>: let me

18:32:20
<transcript>: Let me refresh open this thing up.

18:32:25
<transcript>: Aha.

18:32:29
<transcript>: Oh wrong Never mind.

18:32:32
<transcript>: From browser.

18:32:35
<transcript>: This is the one I want.

18:32:35
<transcript>: okay

18:32:36
<transcript>: Okay.

18:32:42
<transcript>: I forgot I was sending stuff to ivs right now.

18:32:45
<transcript>: Wait. Was I supposed to pull that.

18:32:51
<transcript>: Wow.

18:32:54
<transcript>: Let's mute that one.

18:32:54
<transcript>: i'm apparently

18:32:58
<transcript>: I'm apparently sending the loudest audio ever recorded.

18:33:01
<transcript>: Wow.

18:33:01
<transcript>: okay

18:33:05
<transcript>: Okay. So this is a sample question. So send it.

18:33:11
<transcript>: Oh, in the console? Yeah.

18:33:16
<transcript>: Nice game. Question Properties. Feels good.

18:33:20
<transcript>: Okay. And you're getting this over the oh, sorry. Go ahead.

18:33:27
<transcript>: Refresh right now.

18:33:37
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:33:41
<transcript>: I see.

18:33:41
<transcript>: did

18:33:43
<transcript>: Did I hit it.

18:33:49
<transcript>: Oh Yeah.

18:33:52
<transcript>: Streaming.

18:34:11
<transcript>: Let me. Yeah, let me just clear that and do it again.

18:34:14
<transcript>: Yeah got message.

18:34:21
<transcript>: I see.

18:34:26
<transcript>: They're not riding it to the ivs channel.

18:34:39
<transcript>: off handler and then

18:34:39
<transcript>: Iot.

18:34:43
<transcript>: Off handler. And then trc, trpc, handler.

18:35:59
<transcript>: Can I test streaming to how about tomorrow? I'll do it to this one.

18:36:01
<transcript>: Never mind.

18:36:10
<transcript>: I'm distracting you.

18:37:35
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:37:38
<transcript>: What's wrong? Oh, Yeah.

18:37:48
<transcript>: Get over how loud that was. Oh, my goodness.

18:37:50
<transcript>: That would be crazy.

18:37:58
<transcript>: I just want to go live on a test account. Youtube is so annoying.

18:38:05
<transcript>: Did you just hear mine.

18:38:16
<transcript>: I have to verify that it won't let me use the same phone number.

18:38:27
<transcript>: Think it's working.

18:38:40
<transcript>: Okay, so bring up my Dev session again.

18:38:45
<transcript>: Okay PM Dev.

18:38:49
<transcript>: Running this thing. I'm streaming to ivs.

18:38:57
<transcript>: I'm actually excited about this idea of just like Swift App, kotlin app.

18:39:07
<transcript>: Yeah, but I think Chad gbt is going to be pretty big. It's going to help.

18:39:15
<transcript>: It disappeared. Yeah.

18:39:17
<transcript>: Cool.

18:39:20
<transcript>: Okay.

18:39:27
<transcript>: So now I can use a producer app to send questions. Well, except I can't create new questions, I guess.

18:39:30
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. And then I can just manage them from there.

18:39:34
<transcript>: Cool.

18:39:45
<transcript>: Adam at omore dev works.

18:39:45
<transcript>: el m

18:39:48
<transcript>: El M O R E Dev.

18:39:54
<transcript>: I think just redirect Adam dev, but yeah, that's where my email is at.

18:40:00
<transcript>: Yeah, I think.

18:40:04
<transcript>: I should probably just.

18:40:07
<transcript>: Ran EV.

18:40:09
<transcript>: It does suck.

18:40:20
<transcript>: I think I just was really weird about my email. I didn't want to have, like, I thought, like, Adam at elmore is like my whole name, but now it's like.

18:40:27
<transcript>: like

18:40:27
<transcript>: Yeah. I didn't know what else I would do.

18:40:30
<transcript>: Like me at Adam dev. It just sounds dumb.

18:40:30
<transcript>: yeah

18:40:32
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:40:44
<transcript>: Okay.

18:40:47
<transcript>: That one.

18:40:52
<transcript>: Cool.

18:41:01
<transcript>: Strong password.

18:41:04
<transcript>: You just use Google? Should I just use Google.

18:41:06
<transcript>: Okay.

18:41:12
<transcript>: I'm in.

18:41:46
<transcript>: Yeah? Now what did you say? If I delete? What now.

18:41:46
<transcript>: used just

18:41:48
<transcript>: Used just Uncheck used.

18:41:54
<transcript>: In question.

18:41:56
<transcript>: Did.

18:41:59
<transcript>: Is it real time.

18:42:07
<transcript>: But is it real real time.

18:42:10
<transcript>: Minimum used.

18:42:10
<transcript>: wait am i

18:42:13
<transcript>: Wait. Am I looking at the wrong one.

18:42:22
<transcript>: Oh, answers, and denormalize got it.

18:42:25
<transcript>: Okay. So then.

18:42:25
<transcript>: if i hit

18:42:31
<transcript>: If I hit the other one, it'll do the same thing, and then I can clear those columns. Just delete them.

18:42:33
<transcript>: Cool.

18:42:36
<transcript>: Feels good.

18:42:47
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:43:10
<transcript>: Until there's one person left.

18:43:17
<transcript>: Yeah. I've thought about this, too.

18:43:19
<transcript>: Well hear me.

18:43:26
<transcript>: What if we also just went with like a few beta shows where expectations are low.

18:43:37
<transcript>: Yes.

18:44:03
<transcript>: Oh okay.

18:44:10
<transcript>: Yeah. Is that all going to break down when we don't have Expo? Are we going to be able to use trpc in a Swift app? I guess.

18:44:15
<transcript>: Oh, nice. Look at you.

18:44:15
<transcript>: okay

18:44:16
<transcript>: Okay.

18:44:20
<transcript>: Sounds hard, but I'll take your word for it.

18:44:30
<transcript>: Okay.

18:44:42
<transcript>: Oh Yeah.

18:44:46
<transcript>: I think it makes sense.

18:44:48
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:44:48
<transcript>: we'll make

18:44:53
<transcript>: We'll make some kind of view for the teleprompting side of it.

18:45:02
<transcript>: I want you to wonder what's the easiest path there. What is the like? We don't have to do anything. Extra pass. I could memorize ten questions.

18:45:06
<transcript>: Yeah, no.

18:45:14
<transcript>: Well, I could just put them hard, code them into a teleprompter to start if we just want to not have to build that.

18:45:21
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:46:03
<transcript>: There needs to be like, little factoids, little things to say.

18:46:09
<transcript>: Little like storylines around each question because you got to fill that 10 seconds.

18:46:11
<transcript>: 20 seconds.

18:46:16
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:46:25
<transcript>: This would be intense daily. Like the amount of stuff they had to do to produce this show daily. It's pretty intense.

18:46:29
<transcript>: Yeah, this is content.

18:46:37
<transcript>: We though I feel like we can get there.

18:46:48
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:46:48
<transcript>: so

18:46:49
<transcript>: So.

18:46:49
<transcript>: i'm going to

18:47:00
<transcript>: I'm going to stand up a Swift app, and then before I really build out, I want to get it to kind of where it was. But then before I go any further, I'm going to stand up a kotlin app so we don't just abandon.

18:47:12
<transcript>: Because every time I've ever just built the whole thing in Swift, and then we never end up building like I could see us just wanting to do a show. It's like just an iphone for now and then it just gets painful.

18:47:14
<transcript>: Oh Yeah.

18:47:14
<transcript>: okay yeah

18:47:18
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah. No. We are inside of it. So we represent the two camps.

18:47:24
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. Maybe I'll just start with kotlin. I can do the simulator on mine too.

18:47:28
<transcript>: so maybe

18:47:28
<transcript>: And that's where I've had the most trouble with the Expo side.

18:47:30
<transcript>: So maybe I'll just see if I can get.

18:47:30
<transcript>: a good

18:47:41
<transcript>: A good state in kotlin first. It's really not that much. The app is not that much. I keep reminding myself like, there's not that much. It's just a lot of details, a lot of Polish and animations.

18:47:43
<transcript>: Smoothness.

18:47:48
<transcript>: I do have some other things.

18:47:53
<transcript>: In the work. So I'm getting gum my roommate to do some.

18:47:53
<transcript>: graphics

18:47:55
<transcript>: Graphics.

18:48:02
<transcript>: I hadn't said anything because I don't want you to feel pressured, like I'm just going to do it because I just want to.

18:48:17
<transcript>: And I got on Breakmaster cylinders radar because he sometimes the first time I worked with him, I emailed him. He replied pretty recently pretty soon after and then went dark for like six weeks. And then he emailed back like, okay, let's do this. I'm like, okay.

18:48:23
<transcript>: Let's do it. He's a really interesting guy. So I just wanted to float something and see.

18:48:29
<transcript>: And he did reply, but he's in that six week stage right now where I haven't heard anything for a long time.

18:48:38
<transcript>: So I think if the feed is just most of the experience, if it's just the question answering in the app, I do feel like.

18:48:40
<transcript>: Maintaining two apps isn't too bad.

18:48:40
<transcript>: there's like the

18:48:45
<transcript>: There's like the intro scene, like the countdown to the next show and all that stuff.

18:48:45
<transcript>: that's like

18:48:50
<transcript>: That's like some part of the app, but they can be super minimal, especially at the beginning.

18:49:02
<transcript>: Yeah. It just says, like next show in 6 hours, 33 minutes. And then it has like a leaderboard. It shows you what you've won.

18:49:02
<transcript>: where you rank

18:49:04
<transcript>: Where you rank and stuff for the week.

18:49:09
<transcript>: Yeah. Work for sure.

18:49:09
<transcript>: yeah well

18:49:14
<transcript>: Yeah, well, that part will be super sketch. It'll just be paypaling people manually or whatever.

18:49:17
<transcript>: Cool.

18:49:30
<transcript>: Yeah, there's there's an ivs sdk for each.

18:49:30
<transcript>: like

18:49:42
<transcript>: Like the React native thing just bundles the two sdks. Actually, it's using the same, but even then, I feel like we'll have a little more control. I feel like I can do nothing with that React Native one.

18:49:42
<transcript>: i don't know there's

18:49:48
<transcript>: I don't know. There's so little to configure, so I'm hoping the raw sdks if there's stuff we need to change, we have a little more power. Maybe.

18:50:06
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, it's it's 1080p, but it's portrait I'll show you. Can you still see my screen? Yeah.

18:50:12
<transcript>: He's just making videos that are transparent. Videos. That.

18:50:12
<transcript>: there'll be like

18:50:14
<transcript>: There'll be like overlays and stuff.

18:50:23
<transcript>: Wait, what do you mean? Clip.

18:50:26
<transcript>: I set the obs.

18:50:51
<transcript>: So on Android, I had to do that. Yeah. Because I thought all phones were just I didn't know. So the iphone one. When I first built it, it fit perfectly. And then when I first ran on the simulator on Android, it was too big or something. And I just did a center with, like, an object cover kind of crop. It just cuts off the sides.

18:50:54
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:51:04
<transcript>: It just centers. It makes the height fit and then centers it, and we'll just cut off more of the sides. Yeah. I already had to deal with that on the Expo app.

18:51:11
<transcript>: What's that? The graphic.

18:51:18
<transcript>: Yeah, well, everything will just be kind of focused toward the metal, I think. Like the text, obviously centered and all that.

18:51:21
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:51:21
<transcript>: michael

18:51:24
<transcript>: Michael gum. I just call him gum. Yeah.

18:51:31
<transcript>: I need to get Michael on my streams. He's local. I feel like.

18:51:31
<transcript>: not on

18:51:37
<transcript>: Not on my streams, just in my videos. And just stuff. I feel like it's hard to make stuff.

18:51:37
<transcript>: alone

18:51:43
<transcript>: Alone. I feel like all the good content has lots of people in it. You know what I mean? Like YouTube videos.

18:51:43
<transcript>: mr

18:51:47
<transcript>: Mr. Beast has all his friends and they're in like every video.

18:51:47
<transcript>: feel like

18:51:50
<transcript>: Feel like there's more interesting things happening when there's multiple people.

18:51:50
<transcript>: anyway

18:51:53
<transcript>: Anyway just another side thought.

18:52:02
<transcript>: I gave him the color palette and told him.

18:52:06
<transcript>: He knows the idea. He's seen it. And he signed up and all that before I ever talked to him.

18:52:06
<transcript>: just like

18:52:14
<transcript>: Just like the idea that it's hq inspired. He was thinking, like maybe going more flat graphics as opposed to 3d.

18:52:14
<transcript>: not totally copy

18:52:20
<transcript>: so he was

18:52:20
<transcript>: Not totally copying what hq did like. They had a lot of like 3d abstract shapes and stuff.

18:52:27
<transcript>: So he was thinking more like he's just going to give me a prototype. Like, just give me some ideas that we could look at and say, we like it. We don't.

18:52:42
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. No. We can't do the full intro and everything without the music. That's why I reached out to Breakmaster because it was like, oh, yeah. Shoot. You got to have, like, everything's got to be timed to the music.

18:52:44
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:52:56
<transcript>: Well, yeah. He's just kind of trying to first set, like, a mood board kind of thing. Like, here's some styles we could decide or not, like or whatever. He doesn't have a ton of bandwidth, so it's actually kind of works out.

18:52:56
<transcript>: that

18:52:57
<transcript>: That.

18:53:07
<transcript>: Getting his little cycles right now while trying to work out something with Brakemaster. Brakemaster replied pretty quickly and was like Sounds cool.

18:53:07
<transcript>: that

18:53:15
<transcript>: That'd be great. He asked for some. He had some questions just like stylistically, which I didn't give him much. But I told him.

18:53:30
<transcript>: It's like hq, but it's developer themed, and if we could sort of match the sound, he's so good at this stuff. Match the sound to the visual aesthetic of the website. Like the color theme, the synth wave, kind of like that kind of stuff.

18:53:32
<transcript>: And upbeat obviously.

18:53:45
<transcript>: Yeah. I remember hearing somebody, one of the vox Media people talking about working with Brakemaster cylinder and how they would send him random stuff on, like a Tuesday. That's like we want it to sound like if a tortoise were losing a race.

18:53:50
<transcript>: He would run with it and just give them something that was perfect.

18:53:50
<transcript>: he

18:53:55
<transcript>: He's interesting. Yeah. And then have you heard the song players.

18:53:55
<transcript>: i don't know

18:53:59
<transcript>: I don't know pop culture at all, but.

18:53:59
<transcript>: there's like yeah

18:54:02
<transcript>: There's like yeah, players. By what's her name.

18:54:02
<transcript>: hang on

18:54:11
<transcript>: Hang on. I'm going to find it and send it to you on this Kansas City trip. Like, Casey, listens to popular music. And this song was on and.

18:54:14
<transcript>: I thought Yeah.

18:54:24
<transcript>: It's like not the song, just like the idea of how clean the baseline, just how punchy. I thought something about that's kind of cool. What do you think about that.

18:54:28
<transcript>: You've heard it.

18:54:37
<transcript>: Do you think that style that kind of like just how it's synth, wavy.

18:54:37
<transcript>: yeah

18:54:38
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:54:48
<transcript>: I don't pay attention to words when I listen to music. So Casey makes fun of me because I'll be like, I love this song. She's like, that's a song about hitler or whatever. And I'm like.

18:54:55
<transcript>: I just don't listen to the words. I listen to the sound of their voice. That's an instrument to me but I don't pay attention to lyrics.

18:54:57
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:55:05
<transcript>: That was the latest thing I sent him was like if it could somehow be inspired by this sound.

18:55:07
<transcript>: Like if this sound had a baby.

18:55:11
<transcript>: I think he'll do well with that.

18:55:14
<transcript>: Yeah, exactly.

18:55:21
<transcript>: Oh, man, my office. I've had my lights on since 05:00 a.m.. It is so hot in here.

18:55:21
<transcript>: like

18:55:25
<transcript>: Like they're just going to be on all day while I'm messing with obs.

18:55:31
<transcript>: Yeah, there's no other lights.

18:55:31
<transcript>: i have video light

18:55:37
<transcript>: I have video lights in my can light, like I took out the can bulbs, and I put in, like, amarin or whatever.

18:55:42
<transcript>: Video light specifically, but I never turn them on.

18:55:42
<transcript>: they're not that

18:55:44
<transcript>: They're not that bright either.

18:55:49
<transcript>: Yeah, for real.

18:55:49
<transcript>: it

18:55:55
<transcript>: It's a vibe. Casey hates it because we have plants in here, and she waters them. She's like, you're going to kill this plant. There's not enough light. Sorry.

18:56:01
<transcript>: So she makes me open the window. Sometimes I have to open the curtains.

18:56:13
<transcript>: Yeah, same. Even if I don't have the curtains pulled, there's lights and cameras and stuff in the way like I can't see outside anymore.

18:56:13
<transcript>: it's kind of a

18:56:21
<transcript>: It's kind of a bummer. I had 199 concurrent viewers today. I peaked at 199. So close to 200.

18:56:28
<transcript>: So I was trying to remember I think I got rated by study time once. And I had, like 400 something from.

18:56:33
<transcript>: Her, but like on my own, I don't get rated much because I stream at such a weird time.

18:56:39
<transcript>: It's easy to remember my highs because it's just whatever.

18:56:39
<transcript>: i can

18:56:45
<transcript>: feels

18:56:45
<transcript>: I can grow to I guess yeah. So 199 hoping to break the 200.

18:56:50
<transcript>: Feels good. I don't know. I love streaming. It's so fun. Dax, what are we doing.

18:56:58
<transcript>: and we could ever see

18:56:58
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't know. I think of, like, what if we ever reach prime? The thing grows enough.

18:57:01
<transcript>: can you

18:57:01
<transcript>: And we could ever see like 1000 people.

18:57:07
<transcript>: Can you like does prime do sponsorships like could you sell sponsorships on a thousand person stream.

18:57:20
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:57:40
<transcript>: Oh, I know that. That does suck. Like when I think about like selling your soul, like theo has done the whole deployment Partners thing. Does anyone use that stat? Has anyone built a startup with theo's like cobbled Together, sas, stack.

18:57:51
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:58:10
<transcript>: Does it start to get awkward in his server when like he's such a react stand all of a sudden and like we got the anti react movement.

18:58:18
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:58:47
<transcript>: No, I think about that, too. Like, and and what is it like, pennies on the dollar in terms of sponsorship versus, like, just a dev job. What you get paid? I mean, like, stamp use pays me pretty well. I don't think I'm ever gonna make in sponsorship dollars what I can make just working for somebody. So it's like, you kind of sell your soul for what.

18:58:50
<transcript>: For like.

18:58:58
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:59:09
<transcript>: Man, this whole server components thing. I just can't even it's just the.

18:59:09
<transcript>: whole

18:59:26
<transcript>: Whole React vibe right now is so weird to me like that. They're trying to convince everybody of all this stuff. I just feel way too complicated. It shouldn't be this hard. It shouldn't take someone like, theo this long to be like, come around on it and be like, yeah, okay. This is going to be good. You had to have, like, several conversations with who Dan abramov. Like, come on.

18:59:31
<transcript>: Am I off base.

18:59:49
<transcript>: Yeah.

19:00:08
<transcript>: Right. That'd be pretty epic, though.

19:00:13
<transcript>: Yeah.

19:00:18
<transcript>: No.

19:00:18
<transcript>: yeah good point

19:00:19
<transcript>: Yeah. Good point.

19:00:19
<transcript>: they seem

19:00:21
<transcript>: They seem powerful.

19:00:21
<transcript>: and

19:00:22
<transcript>: they wouldn't

19:00:22
<transcript>: And.

19:00:26
<transcript>: They wouldn't miss a bit of sleep if they killed someone. I don't know. Honestly.

19:00:46
<transcript>: Yeah.

19:01:33
<transcript>: I think it's important. I mean, I don't want to tell you guys what to do, but I do think.

19:01:40
<transcript>: The whole community can't just get red pilled into this or blue pilled. I never know. Is it red pill? Blue pill? I don't know.

19:01:43
<transcript>: Yeah.

19:01:43
<transcript>: doesn't matter

19:01:56
<transcript>: Doesn't matter what color it does feel like a mess I'm doing. I'm going to do, like an April fools. I don't know if anyone's going to care, but I'm going to do like, I think I'm just going to do a Twitter thread next. It's a lot lower effort, but I'm going to do like a Nick. Like, I got a hold of some Nicks.

19:01:56
<transcript>: fourteen

19:02:08
<transcript>: 14 release stuff and I'm going to make graphics to make it look super official. But the dumbest stuff ever powered by Chat gbt, something's going to be like the router or something's going to be powered by AI or something. I don't know. It's going to be dumb stuff.

19:02:11
<transcript>: Yeah.

19:02:22
<transcript>: That whole organization, though. Guillermo and Lee as like the front people. They just seem so like soulless. What is it about them? It feels like the embodiment of the React thing right now. It just drives me crazy.

19:02:53
<transcript>: Yeah.

19:03:18
<transcript>: This haircut.

19:03:27
<transcript>: Yeah.

19:03:49
<transcript>: All right.

19:04:07
<transcript>: Yeah. Maybe sponsorship is not the end game. I don't know why I go to that. It's like I think it's more like justifying all the time, but maybe it's just for fun and who cares? And if you can still get stuff done while you're doing it, then the goal doesn't have to be monetization or whatever.

19:04:21
<transcript>: Yeah. If larvae was no kidding. Yeah, lifestyle. Let's just go into just chatting. Let's just make this a thing.

19:04:21
<transcript>: forget

19:04:23
<transcript>: Forget development.

19:04:35
<transcript>: If clerk as I said like the.

19:04:35
<transcript>: os

19:04:36
<transcript>: Os.

19:04:36
<transcript>: yeah

19:04:38
<transcript>: Yeah.

19:04:47
<transcript>: I'm with you. I'm with you.

19:04:54
<transcript>: I think he started talking about some kind of serverless deployment thing. Chisel strike.

19:04:54
<transcript>: he started doing

19:04:59
<transcript>: He started doing I know that there's no way he just brought that up randomly. I'm pretty sure they're sponsoring some stuff and.

19:04:59
<transcript>: i know

19:05:04
<transcript>: sponsorship

19:05:04
<transcript>: I know. He's been working on something he keeps kind of alluding to.

19:05:07
badloop: test back

19:05:11
badloop: ;-)

19:05:11
<transcript>: Sponsorship stuff he's in the middle of, but I haven't really seen anything other than chisel Strike in his actual streams or YouTube videos.

19:05:16
<transcript>: Yeah. I've never looked at it. So advertising sucks, I guess.

19:05:40
<transcript>: Do an ad read.

19:05:50
<transcript>: Yeah.

19:06:05
<transcript>: It just loses authenticity at that point, doesn't it.

19:06:15
<transcript>: Yeah.

19:06:35
<transcript>: I've totally thought about that. Like, if I ever could get larabar or somebody, like, I've thought about my banner at the bottom, I could just rotate it. David designed a bunch of ways to do, like, ads on stuff, and I've definitely thought about building that into the overlays. Like, rotate. And eli wants to do stuff with stat muse. Like, have, like, a segment on my thing where I talk about statues. I don't know. Who cares.

19:06:35
<transcript>: but yeah

19:06:40
<transcript>: But yeah. No, I've definitely thought through that kind of stuff it'd be different than what theo is doing for sure.

19:06:55
<transcript>: Yeah.

19:07:05
<transcript>: Okay. So you're happy with everything we're done? I know. I bet you that before. You're not, like, annoyed. Okay, cool.

19:07:09
<transcript>: There's a lot of things. It's a lot of things.

19:07:13
<transcript>: I think next week, I'm just going to work on what's that.

19:07:19
<transcript>: Yeah, I think.

19:07:19
<transcript>: i'm going to

19:07:26
<transcript>: I'm going to try and do head down time on rebase next week while casey's gone because I'm not going to probably stream.

19:07:35
<transcript>: And if I stream a whole week of rebate stuff, I just know he always going to ask me, and I just don't want to hear his dumb head ask me that question like, whoa, why are you streaming stemming stuff.

19:07:42
<transcript>: Sorry I've got all this animosity. I say that we're good now, but I don't know how good we are.

19:07:47
<transcript>: Oh, I know, he watches.

19:07:49
<transcript>: He used to watch.

19:07:49
<transcript>: even the first time

19:07:56
<transcript>: Even the first time I streamed before I was even back at sap muse, I know he would make comments about something he saw. I don't think he watches all of it.

19:07:59
<transcript>: So I don't know. Would he notice.

19:07:59
<transcript>: but

19:08:01
<transcript>: on what i'm

19:08:01
<transcript>: But he definitely keeps tabs.

19:08:03
<transcript>: On what I'm doing.

19:08:03
<transcript>: generally

19:08:06
<transcript>: Generally speaking and kind of a creepy way.

19:08:16
<transcript>: Yeah. I should probably stop saying that he hasn't really made a comment about it, though. I mean, I've told him I'm definitely less productive.

19:08:20
<transcript>: No, maybe just a touch.

19:08:22
<transcript>: I'm not getting anything done.

19:08:22
<transcript>: so

19:08:25
<transcript>: So it'd be like, genuinely, it's fine.

19:08:27
<transcript>: You're just calling out the obvious.

19:08:32
<transcript>: I told him.

19:08:32
<transcript>: the hours

19:08:37
<transcript>: The hours that I'm streaming, I'm definitely not getting as much done, but that implies.

19:08:41
<transcript>: For some reason, I'm not streaming, and I'm not.

19:08:48
<transcript>: Anyway. Okay. I'm going to stop before I implicate myself any further.

19:08:50
<transcript>: Yeah, right.

19:08:54
<transcript>: Good podcast episode all over the place.

19:09:12
<transcript>: Yeah, I need to do it. Yes. I just remember the public Dev stuff. How many people signed up for public Dev just from streaming.

19:09:23
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah. Tomorrow. I'm switching over to rebase. Tomorrow. I'm doing it.

19:09:27
<transcript>: No.

19:09:27
<transcript>: i want to get to that

19:09:36
<transcript>: I want to get to that first show. I'm so excited about this, and I want it to be I want it to be a thing. And if I'm doing it on stream, it's just going to be the thing. I'm streaming.

19:09:42
<transcript>: If eli ever asked, I'm just going to tell him a more productive off stream. Don't worry about it.

19:09:50
<transcript>: But honestly, I'll get more done on rebase. Probably because I'll actually work. Well, you got to keep me in check. I don't know.

19:09:58
<transcript>: I got to actually get stuff done I got to get something done.

19:10:08
<transcript>: Yeah.

19:10:16
<transcript>: Okay. We're going to be more productive this week. I want to get some serious stuff done on rebase, on stream.

19:10:16
<transcript>: because i do think

19:10:28
<transcript>: the streaming

19:10:28
<transcript>: Because I do think there's power in working on stuff for developers on Stream. It feels like such a waste to work on sat me stuff when no one is going to like, I don't care if they use that music. We already have a lot of people that use stat news.

19:10:34
<transcript>: The streaming stuff about rebates would be a lot more beneficial because people will actually sign up and be excited for it.

19:10:42
<transcript>: That's true. Yeah, it's true. But then I'll probably get nothing done on either.

19:10:42
<transcript>: especially

19:10:48
<transcript>: Especially so I need the four hour ramp to get up to like, the touch of something.

19:10:52
<transcript>: I really got to stop. I've been noticing.

19:10:52
<transcript>: and this

19:11:09
<transcript>: And this is why just chatting would be perfectly fine, in my opinion, because I am just chatting. I've noticed, like the beginning time when I first switched over to my screen. Some days is over an hour. I've been sitting there talking for over an hour at the beginning. It's like I'm Jay leno, or I think I am and I'm doing like a monologue to start. I don't know why.

19:11:09
<transcript>: i got to

19:11:11
<transcript>: I got to stop.

19:11:19
<transcript>: Yeah. And there's more people. And it's like more exciting and more just like I want to hang out.

19:11:21
<transcript>: And then.

19:11:21
<transcript>: yeah okay

19:11:28
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. But tomorrow I'm starting on rebate stuff on stream, and I'm doing it the rest of the week. I don't care.

19:11:39
<transcript>: It's a good time too, because like stat muse, there's some sensitive stuff I got to work through with the postgres connection and stuff. So I got reasons that I'm doing that off stream. Cool. I'm streaming to YouTube tomorrow too.

19:11:47
<transcript>: I know.

19:11:52
<transcript>: Yeah.

19:11:54
<transcript>: If YouTube were good.

19:12:08
<transcript>: They have the ultra low latency now I noticed, but I can't check it. It's like a radio box. I can click it, and then it just throws an air and bounces back to the other one. So I don't know what that's about, but maybe that'll be more like twitch where it's not such a huge delay.

19:12:20
<transcript>: Yeah. Twitch is fun. I mean YouTube does not have any of the fun stuff. The channel points and the emotes. Yeah.

19:12:20
<transcript>: it just feels

19:12:27
<transcript>: It just feels like business time, like you get on YouTube. And it's like business version of twitch just does not feel fun.

19:12:30
<transcript>: Yeah.

19:12:44
<transcript>: I mean, there is such a huge there's such a huge audience on YouTube. It seems like it should be a good place to stream. And I'm just not making YouTube videos right now. So I'd like to be on YouTube in some form.

19:12:52
<transcript>: But I don't know what it's going to be like. I'm going to have, like, three people over there and they're going to chat, and I'm not going to see it. And then they're going to just get frustrated, leave.

19:12:56
<transcript>: Okay.

19:13:06
<transcript>: type some

19:13:06
<transcript>: Yeah, just a concept. Loop me tithing and they're like, hey, I'm on twitch. Come on.

19:13:07
<transcript>: Type some more.

19:13:15
<transcript>: My camera keeps overheating it's more than the A seven S, three S. They do not overheat. It's. Not hot. Oh, because it's shut off.

19:13:22
<transcript>: That's weird. That's never overheated before. Okay. We should probably do stuff.

19:13:22
<transcript>: yeah

19:13:23
<transcript>: Yeah.

19:13:27
<transcript>: Cool more record of podcasts tomorrow maybe.

19:13:33
<transcript>: Okay. See you tomorrow. While I'm getting so much done, I probably won't even notice you in Chat. I'll be too busy.

19:13:34
<transcript>: But.

19:13:34
<transcript>: see you

19:13:43
<transcript>: See you in a while. Oh, there you go. Yeah. Just don't even show up. Just get some stuff done. Let's get some stuff done tomorrow. I'm here for it. All right. See you next.

19:15:01
adamdotdev: LUL

19:33:04
<transcript>: Check.

19:57:06
<transcript>: Excel Port. Oh, I just realized you can hear me. I can just use the mic.

19:57:06
<transcript>: i'm just

19:57:11
<transcript>: I'm just testing. I'm going to multi stream tomorrow to YouTube and Twitch.

19:57:13
<transcript>: So I'm testing it out.

19:57:13
<transcript>: trying to

19:57:15
<transcript>: Trying to see.

19:57:15
<transcript>: if

19:57:17
<transcript>: If it's all going to work.

19:57:17
<transcript>: i'm

19:57:21
<transcript>: I'm sending it to YouTube in 4k.

19:57:21
<transcript>: do i

19:57:25
<transcript>: Do I look so high res you probably can't even watch me in 4k.

19:57:29
<transcript>: So there's that.

19:57:42
<transcript>: There's such a long delay on YouTube.

19:58:10
<transcript>: I'm also gonna have to figure out chat. Hey, Peter.

19:58:12
<transcript>: Got to figure out.

19:58:18
<transcript>: The chat situation if I'm gonna have chat up for Twitch and.

19:58:18
<transcript>: youtube

19:58:19
<transcript>: Youtube.

19:58:24
<transcript>: Oh, you don't see the 4k option.

19:58:26
<transcript>: That's a bummer.

19:58:50
<transcript>: Makes me feel like I did all this for nothing. If I could have just streamed it all in 1080p, this would unlike easier. I like resized my overlays. I went to extreme links so I resized my overlays to be from one thousand and eighty P to be four K. I down sample for twitch, so I Resize it when I encode for Twitter.

19:58:55
<transcript>: This is only a test. Yeah, I'm just testing.

19:58:59
<transcript>: Sir yose is here. This is the wrong streaming platform. Yeah.

19:58:59
<transcript>: i'm actually on

19:59:09
<transcript>: I'm actually on Francis is here. I'm actually on twitch as well right now just on a test account. I couldn't get a test account working for YouTube. So here I am on my main account.

19:59:09
<transcript>: sorry about

19:59:11
<transcript>: Sorry about it.

19:59:20
<transcript>: You'll never guess what my twitch test account is.

19:59:20
<transcript>: it's so

19:59:23
<transcript>: It's so secretive, so sneaky.

19:59:27
<transcript>: So there's a huge delay.

19:59:27
<transcript>: on youtube

19:59:29
<transcript>: On YouTube.

19:59:29
<transcript>: you got

19:59:32
<transcript>: You got 1440p, but no. 4k.

19:59:32
<transcript>: no

19:59:35
<transcript>: anybody

19:59:35
<transcript>: No. 21. 60 P.

19:59:36
<transcript>: Anybody.

19:59:39
<transcript>: Anybody BUELLER.

19:59:47
<transcript>: It doesn't even look that much better than twitch. Like I've got twitch pulled up. I don't know. Is it even better.

19:59:57
<transcript>: Like I've got 4k pulled up let's put them on separate let's see.

20:00:03
<transcript>: On YouTube. You guys can't hear my song, can you the music's not playing? Hopefully.

20:00:09
<transcript>: Because YouTube doesn't like that. I think you found the 4k option. All right.

20:00:14
<transcript>: I think this is going to work.

20:00:25
<transcript>: You have got 21 60 P perfect do I look 4k ish oh you're on YouTube mobile app so maybe that doesn't have 4k or it does.

20:00:28
<transcript>: Maybe.

20:00:34
<transcript>: I'm gonna have to get used to the delay? No music perfect.

20:00:34
<transcript>: i'm gonna

20:00:37
<transcript>: I'm gonna have to get used to hue.

20:00:42
<transcript>: on chat

20:00:42
<transcript>: Other than that I mean, I'm usually pretty behind anyway.

20:00:45
<transcript>: On Chat on Twitch.

20:00:48
<transcript>: The 4k doesn't even look better to me.

20:00:48
<transcript>: am i

20:00:50
<transcript>: Am I doing something wrong.

20:00:54
<transcript>: I might be doing something wrong.

20:01:05
<transcript>: Oh, no, it's better, yeah, it's better.

20:01:07
<transcript>: Interesting.

20:01:12
<transcript>: It's mostly the graphics. I can tell. I can't really tell on my camera.

20:01:17
<transcript>: The graphics are definitely better.

20:01:32
<transcript>: It might be a little bit better. Yeah. My camera just doesn't look that different for it being.

20:01:32
<transcript>: four times

20:01:34
<transcript>: Four times the resolution.

20:01:54
<transcript>: Somebody who watches me on Twitch.

20:01:54
<transcript>: does it actually

20:02:03
<transcript>: Does it actually look better on YouTube? Does the quality look better? Is this all worth it? I don't even have twitch pulled up. No. Where's my chat? Here we go.

20:02:08
<transcript>: Crisp. All right, 4k. Didn't look too much better. Yeah, I don't feel like it looks much better.

20:02:14
<transcript>: It does have it just a manual switch. Okay on PC looks okay high 4k on desktop.

20:02:24
<transcript>: By the way. Mccoups from twitch. Yassin. Hello, me coops. I know me, coops. I did not know your name was. Am I saying it right, Yassin.

20:02:24
<transcript>: am i saying

20:02:26
<transcript>: Am I saying it.

20:02:26
<transcript>: up to four

20:02:30
<transcript>: Up to 4k on my iphone 13 mini.

20:02:38
<transcript>: Okay. Dolph is here. Rare stream. A rare afternoon YouTube stream. This is a one of one.

20:02:38
<transcript>: it will not happen

20:02:39
<transcript>: It will not happen again.

20:02:44
<transcript>: Looks the same to you. Yeah. Interesting.

20:02:52
<transcript>: Why am I doing this? If it looks the same, okay, let me try this. Let me kill.

20:02:56
<transcript>: I wonder if I kill.

20:02:57
<transcript>: twitch strea

20:02:57
<transcript>: The.

20:02:59
<transcript>: Twitch stream.

20:03:04
<transcript>: Let's see.

20:03:16
<transcript>: I'm trying to push the boundaries here. I'm trying to send 4k.

20:03:18
<transcript>: while

20:03:18
<transcript>: To YouTube.

20:03:22
<transcript>: While down sampling to 1080p for Twitch.

20:03:28
<transcript>: All on one machine. And it's mostly working.

20:03:34
<transcript>: But my camera quality doesn't seem any better.

20:03:39
<transcript>: And I don't like it. Let's see. Camera one.

20:03:49
<transcript>: 38, 40 by 21, 60.

20:03:51
<transcript>: Yeah.

20:04:12
<transcript>: It is sending 4k, isn't it? Yeah, it wouldn't let you choose four K, one thirty three A. M. Oh, yeah. You all live elsewhere.

20:04:12
<transcript>: you live all over

20:04:14
<transcript>: You live all over the place.

20:04:17
<transcript>: It's not afternoon for you.

20:04:26
<transcript>: Which bitrate? Oh, I'm using 34k. Can I go higher? Can I go higher than 34k? Let's see.

20:04:29
<transcript>: Youtube, live.

20:04:32
<transcript>: Bitrate.

20:04:37
<transcript>: It says for 4k.

20:04:37
<transcript>: at thirty

20:04:41
<transcript>: kb

20:04:41
<transcript>: At 30 frames, 13 to 34,000.

20:04:43
<transcript>: Kbps.

20:04:49
<transcript>: And I'm sending 34, which is the top of that range. I could send more. We could try more.

20:04:49
<transcript>: let's see

20:04:50
<transcript>: Let's see.

20:04:50
<transcript>: let's try

20:04:53
<transcript>: Let's try 40. Let's just see what it does.

20:04:56
<transcript>: 40,000.

20:05:00
<transcript>: About that.

20:05:02
<transcript>: Work.

20:05:07
<transcript>: I don't know if I can do it if I can just do that Midstream.

20:05:11
<transcript>: I'm trying.

20:05:20
<transcript>: Yeah, it's a lot. I mean, I've got dedicated one gig up and down, so I feel like.

20:05:23
<transcript>: does it look

20:05:23
<transcript>: It should be able to handle it.

20:05:26
<transcript>: Does it look any better now? I don't know if it changed at all.

20:05:29
<transcript>: 4k.

20:05:35
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't feel like it changes if I change to 1440p.

20:05:37
<transcript>: Nothing changes.

20:05:50
<transcript>: So 1080p looks noticeably worse.

20:05:56
<transcript>: On this monitor but if I go up to 4k.

20:06:00
<transcript>: The camera just doesn't look better.

20:06:19
<transcript>: Well, it'll work for tomorrow it'll work for my stream tomorrow, I guess.

20:06:21
<transcript>: I thought I could get.

20:06:28
<transcript>: So I'm sending 40k now and it didn't complain. I'm actually going to kill the stream and start it again.

20:07:57
<transcript>: In my back.

20:08:00
<transcript>: Am I back.

20:08:03
<transcript>: I believe so.

20:08:14
<transcript>: I don't think it's any better I'm pumping a lot more bitrate.

20:08:19
<transcript>: But this doesn't look any better.

20:08:33
<transcript>: It doesn't look bad. I guess maybe these cameras are so good that they look okay in one thousand and eighty P. And they look okay in 4k, but.

20:08:33
<transcript>: they don't look

20:08:35
<transcript>: They don't look noticeably better.

20:08:50
<transcript>: so

20:08:50
<transcript>: Camera settings and obs are also on 4k yeah they are.

20:08:54
<transcript>: So it looks good on your 65 inch TV, Taylor. Okay.

20:08:59
<transcript>: On iphone it looks pretty crisp even when zooming in.

20:09:05
<transcript>: I guess this will have to do. I feel like it could be better.

20:09:07
<transcript>: I feel like it could be better.

20:09:16
<transcript>: Let's try some different scenes.

20:09:24
<transcript>: What's this look like in 4k.

20:09:31
<transcript>: I just want to watch the transition. I know we're staring at my own face. I get it. There we go. That looks normal.

20:09:31
<transcript>: okay

20:09:32
<transcript>: Okay.

20:09:37
<transcript>: Except it stayed there forever.

20:09:41
<transcript>: Oh, it's broken.

20:09:41
<transcript>: definitely

20:09:43
<transcript>: Definitely broken.

20:09:54
<transcript>: Why is it broken.

20:09:59
<transcript>: Obs canvas is also 4k Yeah.

20:10:04
<transcript>: Hair gets sharper. Okay. So there is a difference. Then that's good.

20:10:04
<transcript>: what did i do

20:10:07
<transcript>: What did I do to my overlays? Why are they broken.

20:10:28
<transcript>: Is it working.

20:10:36
<transcript>: Cool.

20:10:41
<transcript>: Okay. So it's working on Twitch.

20:10:41
<transcript>: working

20:10:43
<transcript>: Working on YouTube.

20:10:51
<transcript>: Let's see. Are you streaming at 60 frames? No, it's just 30 frames.

20:10:55
<transcript>: I thought about even going to 24 P.

20:10:59
<transcript>: That might help me use 4k on all my cameras.

20:11:04
<transcript>: Like this one. How's this one? Look on this.

20:11:09
<transcript>: Down.

20:11:18
<transcript>: Not terrible for being a 1080p shot. It's only 1080p. It's a little fuzzy.

20:11:22
<transcript>: A little fuzzy.

20:11:37
<transcript>: Yeah. So this is only a 1080p camera. I mean, it's a 4k camera, but I'm only shooting capturing in 1080p, so that one looks a little less.

20:11:37
<transcript>: so

20:11:42
<transcript>: So how am I going to handle chat? How am I going to handle chat.

20:11:43
<transcript>: pop out

20:11:43
<transcript>: It's like I need it.

20:11:47
<transcript>: Pop out chat. Okay, I can do this.

20:11:47
<transcript>: i can have a little

20:11:51
<transcript>: I can have a little YouTube pop out next to my.

20:11:54
<transcript>: Okay.

20:12:08
<transcript>: How can I put this next to.

20:12:17
<transcript>: New window.

20:12:22
<transcript>: Bookmarks.

20:12:29
<transcript>: That could work.

20:13:23
<transcript>: Sorry this is just a test so if you're bored.

20:13:28
<transcript>: There's a reason it's just a test just trying to get set up for tomorrow's stream.

20:13:33
<transcript>: Let's see.

20:13:45
<transcript>: What I want? I want to pop out chat? How do I pop out chat.

20:13:49
<transcript>: Just like that.

20:13:59
<transcript>: Okay. That could work.

20:14:01
<transcript>: That could work.

20:14:21
<transcript>: Ignore YouTube chat. They can pause and resume the live stream so they may be way behind the live forecast. Okay, cool. I can do that. I'm good at ignoring chat. No, I'm not. I'm terrible at it, but we'll just have YouTube chat as like a distant. Maybe I peek at it every once in a while, kind of thing. Mostly just to direct people.

20:14:25
<transcript>: Youtube chat is mid cool.

20:14:28
<transcript>: Okay. Feels good.

20:14:30
<transcript>: I think I'm good.

20:14:30
<transcript>: youtube

20:14:32
<transcript>: Youtube.

20:14:34
<transcript>: Chat.

20:14:39
<transcript>: So I'll have the option of looking at it if I need to.

20:14:41
<transcript>: What else.

20:14:45
<transcript>: i don't love it

20:14:45
<transcript>: I don't love the quality.

20:14:46
<transcript>: I don't love it.

20:14:48
<transcript>: Doesn't feel.

20:14:54
<transcript>: That much better at 4k, but people don't have to watch it in 4k either.

20:14:58
<transcript>: Right. I can watch it in whatever they want.

20:15:05
<transcript>: Yeah.

20:15:08
<transcript>: Cool.

20:15:14
<transcript>: Tomorrow. I'm streaming on both twitch and YouTube. Watch me wherever you prefer.

20:15:18
<transcript>: I did this once before I did it with restream.

20:15:26
<transcript>: I wasn't a big fan of the restream experience. There was a delay on everything, so twitch was even way behind.

20:15:26
<transcript>: just felt

20:15:28
<transcript>: Just felt bad.

20:15:31
<transcript>: I think this is going to work though.

20:15:35
<transcript>: Let's close all this out.

20:15:44
<transcript>: It is a test with YouTube live horrid I will be actually not testing real deal streaming tomorrow morning.

20:15:52
<transcript>: 07:00 Eastern in the United States. Whatever time that is for you.

20:15:52
<transcript>: i will

20:15:56
<transcript>: I will see you all tomorrow. I'm going to get off here. I'm going to actually kill the stream now.

20:15:58
<transcript>: Okay bye.

20:16:01
<transcript>: Well if I can figure out how.

20:16:01
<transcript>: this mult

20:16:04
<transcript>: This Multi rtmp thing.

20:16:04
<transcript>: wait

20:16:07
<transcript>: Wait. Is twitch still going.

20:16:10
<transcript>: Is twitch still going.

20:16:12
<transcript>: Yes.

20:16:17
<transcript>: And I guess on twitch, they can hear the music.
