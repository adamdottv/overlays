adjectiveallison: This is some hot design

00:03:41
adjectiveallison: real real pretty stream starting soon

00:04:25
kryotoboi: Me has arrived

00:04:48
thdxr: late start for Adam

00:05:36
kryotoboi: Yeah, I usually watch @thdxr by this time

00:06:26
daneoshiga: I opened twitch wondering if Adam was streaming.. got in just at the beginning of the stream

00:06:37
zachrip: @daneoshiga nah it's over already

00:06:47
zachrip: he's off eating his fancy dates and mangos

00:06:52
kryotoboi: Oh this is the outro

00:07:22
adjectiveallison: Dax did you go to university?

00:07:39
thdxr: @adjectiveallison nope

00:08:10
adjectiveallison: damn I was afraid of that. I want access to the A&M fitness center cause all the gyms around here suck so I'm considering becoming a student primarily for that.

00:08:10
kryotoboi: I study at the Dax University

00:08:42
adjectiveallison: But there is an option to be "affiliate" and I figured a college goer would know what that means

00:09:13
thdxr: I run to my gym it's literally 1min away

00:09:26
daneoshiga: getting this out of the way xD

00:10:02
adjectiveallison: I need a good pool is the primary reason because my knees and shins have been angry. I stopped by this aquatic wellness center and it would maybe work but isn't great. No other gym in the area has a pool.

00:10:06
camdickie: Dax is fuming rn

00:18:23
<transcript>: Make coding streamer guide in next month. Oh, that's my goal. Okay, man. Brave. I still can't decide what form I want to make. Like, what medium. I started writing a bunch of stuff, so I wrote a bunch of, like, trying to structure what all do I want to try and explain to people? And then I was like, Is this a course or is it just like, three random videos that don't.

00:18:23
<transcript>: have to

00:18:26
nexxeln: make it a website

00:18:27
gitpush_gitpaid: everyone got their tax returns. twitch subbing at an all time high MaxLOL

00:18:30
<transcript>: Have to be that related because there's so many different topics in terms of streaming your work.

00:18:30
<transcript>: there's like

00:18:40
nexxeln: oh video better tbh

00:18:42
<transcript>: There's like the technical setup and all that goes into overlays and obs and gear and all that. Then there's like the why stream. What do you get out of it.

iannery: @Eyug_A it's literally a chance to win a macbook.

00:18:55
camdickie: (i hope)

00:19:02
<transcript>: The psychological side of what you should go into it thinking the strategy side of it. There's just so many different angles. And I don't know if one course is the right thing, if it's a video course. I don't watch videos. So it's hard for me to wrap my head around. Like, would people actually get something out of this? Would people watch it? I don't know.

00:19:09
eyug_a: hii @adamdotdev what is Chance at a MacBook? maweexDed

00:19:11
<transcript>: My man has no chill on his bragging. Yeah, I set goals and accomplish them easily. Suffering from success. Sorry, no, it's not that I accomplished them easily.

00:19:11
<transcript>: it's that

00:19:15
<transcript>: It's that I set goals that are too close.

00:19:15
<transcript>: it's like

00:19:20
<transcript>: It's like I'm going to get this soon. Why would I set that goal? You know what I mean.

00:19:30
<transcript>: I don't set lofty enough goals where they say, Aim for the moon. You might hit a star or something. Aim for the stars might hit the moon. I don't know something like that. That's my problem. Ayug.

gitpush_gitpaid: ive literally seen people complaining about how theyre not twitch partner lol

00:19:50
<transcript>: Welcome to my chat. Oh, no. You just mentioned me. Sometimes I get confused by the visuals. What is Chance at a macbook? It is a chance at winning a macbook Pro. You have a .01% chance. When you redeem that thing of winning, no one has won yet, but it's only been a week or so and somebody's going to win. It's going to be very exciting when they do.

00:19:52
iannery: @Eyug_A you redeem the thing

00:19:53
<transcript>: Lannery is here.

00:19:53
<transcript>: what

00:20:03

<transcript>: Theo? Tweeted.

00:20:08
<transcript>: i think

00:20:15
<transcript>: I think I knew this. I think I remember learning this. But you just started programming in the last, like, two years or something stupid like that.

00:20:17
itsmeleague: so 1 in 10000? that's probably doable Pog

00:20:18
<transcript>: That's crazy craziness.

00:20:26
techsavvytravvy: i refuse to believe that

00:20:26
eyug_a: which model

00:20:27
adjectiveallison: I think a form of content that is searchable would be nice. e.g. If it ends up being videos you make I think there is a lot of value in a text version of the same content, even if it's just a sparknotes styled thing.

00:20:29
techsavvytravvy: can't be true

00:20:30
nexxeln: yeah december 2021

<transcript>: Did I answer? Did you ask that twice? What is chance of macbook? Oh, you did ask that twice. Okay.

00:20:43
<transcript>: 47,900 points. Until my one on one. Every time I see somebody write something like that. I think they're saying that they have that many points. And then it's always until.

00:20:50
<transcript>: Looking forward to it Cuba. Maybe a while. I'll have to stream a lot for you to get enough points.

00:20:52
thdxr: btw 47900 points until my 1on1 call with Adam

00:20:54
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:20:57
<transcript>: Daddy, Bezos Manny.

00:20:57
<transcript>: oh

00:21:02
itsmeleague: only 900 points until I win the macbook lets go

00:21:03
manbravegg: I think showing how to start with good art, decent equipment, and how to make / get overlays and alerts that look clean on screen is a great start. Perhaps a community site would be a good project for this? So you can add to it over time and make a community around code streaming to help bring attention to rebase?

00:21:09
zachrip: @thdxr get that macbook

00:21:11
<transcript>: Oh, I'm sorry, eug. I'm just behind. I answered your question, but see how behind I am? I just saw your message where you were. Like, hey, please answer my question. That's how behind I am. It's probably like ten minutes. At this point, everyone got their tax returns, which subbing in an all time.

cowfacedev: just over 36k points for my call LUL

00:24:21
<transcript>: He just does that. There he is, by the way, 47,900. You sucker. I think a form of content that is searchable would be nice example. If it ends up being videos, you make it or you make. I think there's a lot of value in a text version of the same content, even if it's just a spark note thing. So, yeah, here's the thing. I thought about writing a blog post. I haven't written a blog post.

00:24:25
<transcript>: In years and.

00:24:25
<transcript>: i've never really

00:24:29
<transcript>: I've never really enjoyed writing blog posts, but I thought this might just be.

00:24:29
<transcript>: text

00:24:33
<transcript>: Text content. I could make a video, but.

00:24:33
<transcript>: i feel like

00:24:36
<transcript>: I feel like it might be more valuable in text form.

00:24:36
<transcript>: i don't know

00:24:37
<transcript>: I don't know.

00:24:41
<transcript>: So one in 10,000.

thdxr: the hard part about blog posts is you have to rebuild your site every time

00:24:45
<transcript>: It's doable I mean, eventually it's my League. Somebody's going to win it eventually.

00:24:52
<transcript>: You're welcome. Yug. Oh, wait, no. You're telling lannery thanks. I told you too. It just took me a while.

<transcript>: Paywall for stapmies.com. I'm so sorry to all the statues users.

00:25:04
<transcript>: but if

00:25:06
<transcript>: But if you do over 100 searches a month.

00:25:16
<transcript>: You got to start paying us. That's what we're doing. We're going to build that. I mean, I'm not going to build it in one day. It's going to take me a while, but I'm starting on it.

00:25:16
<transcript>: today

00:25:18
<transcript>: Today on stream.

00:25:18
<transcript>: i think showing

00:25:38
<transcript>: I think showing how to start with good art, decent equipment and how to make git overlays and alerts that look clean on screen is a great start. Perhaps a community site would be a good project for this so you can add it over time and make a community around code streaming to help bring attention to rebase. You know what, man? Brave. We've already done this. It's watch dev. Go to watch dev. It'll take you to discord. We've built a community.

00:25:44
<transcript>: Of people who like streaming software Dev and people who like watching them.

00:25:44
<transcript>: there

00:25:46
<transcript>: There is a community for it.

00:25:50
adjectiveallison: watch.dev/get_started.php

<transcript>: I just don't know to what end. Like, sometimes I have an idea and I really want to do it. And I feel like I actually wrote a ton of stuff. It's flowing out of me because I want to share this stuff. But then I'm like, Why am I spending all this time on this? I just don't know. How many people does this affect? Are there, like, six people. They're going to get something out of this. And do I just spend, like, weeks on it? You know what I mean.

00:26:26
<transcript>: Sometimes I just don't know the why I have all the other boxes checked. Like I want to do it. I know I could do it. Well, I know it will be good. I just don't know if it's valuable.

00:26:26
<transcript>: does that make

00:26:28
<transcript>: Does that make sense.

00:26:39

<transcript>: afraid

00:39:12
<transcript>: Afraid to make money boy.

00:39:21
<transcript>: Oh, look at that tree sitter. So is my lsp actually configured. Now I feel like, don't I need to do more than that.

00:39:25
<transcript>: Your lsp? Config is so different.

00:39:31
<transcript>: Here. Do I even need to do insure installed here.

00:39:32
<transcript>: Or not.

00:39:32
<transcript>: i don't know what

<transcript>: I need to do anything. What's this.

00:39:46
<transcript>: that's cmp

00:39:47
<transcript>: That's CMP.

00:39:53
<transcript>: I don't know. Here we're configuring the ts server. Do I need to do any configuring.

00:39:58

00:40:01
<transcript>: okay cool

00:40:02
glamshatterskull: no...

00:40:03
<transcript>: Okay. Cool. Good talk.

00:40:06
<transcript>: Looks better now. Looks nice.

00:40:06
<transcript>: no

00:40:09
<transcript>: No, I'm not done, bummer.

00:40:09
<transcript>: i guess i could start

00:40:12
glamshatterskull: lsp wise it's all through mason

00:40:12
<transcript>: I guess I could start seeing if there's like type ahead.

00:40:12
<transcript>: sealed

00:40:13
<transcript>: Sealed.

00:40:16
<transcript>: That's just copilot.

00:40:26
<transcript>: Lsp wise is all through Mason. I thought Mason just installed like the underlying thing on my machine, but I still have to configure the lsp. Is that not how it works.

00:40:26
<transcript>: i got like

00:40:32
<transcript>: I got like the elixir icon. Now over here on all these files. Maybe I already had that actually.

00:40:35
<transcript>: Okay.

00:40:35
<transcript>: let's see

00:40:38
<transcript>: Let's see I've got a stripe account.

00:40:40
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:40:43
<transcript>: Over.

00:40:49
<transcript>: And then you have a session.

00:40:52
<transcript>: And then.

00:40:52
<transcript>: so

00:40:56
<transcript>: So here on sammy's. Com. I need to put some sign up.

00:40:56
<transcript>: verb

00:40:58
<transcript>: Verbiage.

00:41:01
<transcript>: And.

00:41:03
<transcript>: I need to.

00:41:09
<transcript>: Limit queries and also the number of results. So when you do a query.

00:41:09
<transcript>: like

00:41:12
<transcript>: Like most points in a game.

00:41:20
<transcript>: We're going to limit the number of results if you're not a paid user.

00:41:33
<transcript>: I think you said we're going to limit to 25, though, and I think that is 25. There's certain cases where it's more than 25. And I guess we're just going to clamp those off. Maybe we should just do like the first ten, though, and then not show you the rest.

00:41:36
<transcript>: This feels so dirty.

00:41:36
<transcript>: but

00:41:39
<transcript>: But also we got to make money.

00:41:41
<transcript>: It's just reality.

00:41:41
<transcript>: can't just be

00:41:43
<transcript>: Can't just be free forever.

00:41:47
<transcript>: These ads make a lot of money.

00:42:00
<transcript>: Oh, Phil, it's kind of a creepy Phil nicholson photo. I mean, I guess that's what he looks like. Waltox good at what he does. But why did I end up on that? Did I click on something.

00:42:06
<transcript>: I'm working on a status paywall hack on my stream.

00:42:06
<transcript>: what

00:42:09
<transcript>: What like how to get around it.

00:42:11
<transcript>: There will be ways to get around it.

00:42:15
<transcript>: But we're not going to talk about that.

00:42:16
<transcript>: Okay.

00:42:18
<transcript>: So.

00:42:20
overra_dev: a sponsor

00:42:22
<transcript>: I need to. First of all, I don't think the login works.

00:42:26
<transcript>: I don't think it works because email doesn't work here.

00:42:33
<transcript>: I don't think this works.

00:42:33
techsavvytravvy: !lurk

00:42:36
<transcript>: Fuzzy work.

00:42:39
<transcript>: No, never works.

00:42:39
<transcript>: lurk away

<transcript>: A sponsor.

00:43:00
<transcript>: Draft is awesome. I love it. Trav. Okay, I'm opening up my email now.

00:43:03
<transcript>: I'm doing it with some Privacy.

00:43:09
<transcript>: No email.

00:43:10
theruggedbear: it's not fuzzy

00:43:14
<transcript>: So I got to figure out how to get email working so I can test this thing.

00:43:14
gitpush_gitpaid: i always thought that babe ruth looked like george costanza in that pic

00:43:19
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:43:21
<transcript>: Email.

00:43:28
<transcript>: So you're thinking of the read me about email. I wonder.

00:43:37

00:43:42
<transcript>: not

00:43:44
<transcript>: Not this stuff.

00:43:52
<transcript>: What is the user details.

00:43:55
<transcript>: What is this.

00:43:57
<transcript>: Didn't know this existed.

00:43:59
<transcript>: This is a page.

00:44:05
<transcript>: Oh, missing something. Eex files? Is that like it's a template.

00:44:05
<transcript>: oh it's an elixir

00:44:09
<transcript>: Oh, it's an elixir template. Why is that not tree settered.

00:44:09
<transcript>: i

00:44:20
<transcript>: I always thought that babe Ruth looked like George castanza in that pick. He kind of does good call it's not fuzzy. O I N fuzzied rugged Bear. I think it should be unfuzzied now.

00:44:20
<transcript>: it's

00:44:21
thdxr: you can do TS install all

00:44:22
<transcript>: It's fine, it's fine.

00:44:22
<transcript>: so

00:44:25
thdxr: forgot how

00:44:29
<transcript>: So I'm thinking about TS install all, oh, really? Ts install all.

00:44:36
<transcript>: I just did TS install all and it's doing stuff.

00:44:39
glamshatterskull: treesitter and lsp are different things

00:44:40
thdxr: might as well

00:44:44
<transcript>: It is doing stuff. What does that all refer to.

00:44:54
<transcript>: Like it installs literally all of the treats that are parsers. Oh, yeah, sure enough, Julia. I guess it's just installing them all.

00:44:54
<transcript>: yeah

00:44:54
glamshatterskull: treesitter handles context highlighting

00:44:57
<transcript>: Yeah, treated or nulls for your different things.

00:44:57
<transcript>: but does anyone

00:45:02
<transcript>: But does anyone know if I actually did everything I need to do for my lsp? I don't know that I did.

00:45:12
<transcript>: But also, what is lsp accomplished for me in elixir? There's no types, right? I guess. Does the lsp help me still.

00:45:17
<transcript>: We're at 107 of 161.

00:45:27
<transcript>: Tree setter handles context highlighting. Yeah. Look, we've got partial highlighting in this file. Now, suddenly parts of it.

00:45:27
<transcript>: so what

00:45:31
thdxr: is Adam lagging for anyone else

00:45:34
<transcript>: So what is this page? I want to find this page. Client templates metal. Oh, this is metal. Metal.

00:45:34
<transcript>: is that a lag

00:45:37
<transcript>: Is that a lagging? Oh, no.

00:45:37
<transcript>: oh no

00:45:38
<transcript>: Oh no.

00:45:42
luco_mo: @thdxr fine on my end

00:45:44
<transcript>: Are we dropping frames? No, not dropping frames. I'm lagging.

00:45:45
glamshatterskull: i thought he was just a slow reader @thdxr LUL

00:45:45
spotmonk: git gud internet n00b

00:45:48
<transcript>: Fine on my end oh, boy.

00:45:51
<transcript>: I thought he was just a slow reader.

00:45:53
snow_saram: nah clear on my end

00:45:57
thdxr: nvm

00:46:00
<transcript>: It's like something with the video lagging docs, or just you mean my brain clear on Snow serums. And welcome to Chat. Snow.

00:46:06
<transcript>: I am a slow reader. Also I'm coming off caffeine.

00:46:06
<transcript>: i have caffeine

00:46:18
<transcript>: I have caffeine while my wife was gone. She doesn't like the smell of coffee. And like all the trappings of coffee. So when she's gone, I'm free to drink coffee, and I'm coming off of it. Kind of hurts. My brain hurts.

00:46:18
<transcript>: it's slow

00:46:20
<transcript>: It's slow.

00:46:27
thdxr: Liz is gone this week idk what to do

00:46:30
<transcript>: We're still installing tree sitter, parsers.

00:46:31
iannery: maybe switch to black tea or matcha?

00:46:35
<transcript>: Wait. Liz has gone all week. Dax.

00:46:35
<transcript>: i remember

00:46:39
<transcript>: I remember you saying you had to travel. But I didn't catch that. Liz is gone.

00:46:42
iannery: no one should ever get out of caffeine

00:46:48
adjectiveallison: matcha is incredible

00:46:53
<transcript>: Maybe switch to black tea or matcha. Yeah. Lanary, this actually does have some caffeine in it. I'm coming off of the copious amounts of caffeine that I was. This is just a little bit to try and get me through and to fall off gracefully.

00:46:53
<transcript>: but

00:46:54
2dorkstv: man, I would be a disaster if my wife left for a week :D

00:46:57
<transcript>: But it is a tea that has some caffeine in it.

00:47:00
thdxr: I went with her to NJ but she has work stuff this week so I came home early

00:47:04
thdxr: in NY

00:47:13
<transcript>: Matcha is incredible, man. I would be a disaster if my wife left for a week. I am a disaster. Two dorks. It was awful. My sleep schedule is all screwed up. I don't know why I decided. Okay, this is taking forever. I'm just coming over here. It's installing tree sitter parsers or something. I'm going to act like I know what that means.

00:47:13
<transcript>: yeah

00:47:14
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:47:14
<transcript>: it was

00:47:20
2dorkstv: oh yeah. Hot pockets and not going to bed. It would not be okay

00:47:26
thdxr: I ate candy for dinner yesterday

00:47:33
<transcript>: It was a nightmare. My wife has gone for a week. And just like everything is different. The house just felt different. My schedule is different. Just everything. It sucked. I hate it. She's back. I'm so excited. My wife is back. I went with her to New Jersey, but she has work stuff this week. So I came home early in New York.

00:47:33
<transcript>: okay

00:47:34
<transcript>: Okay.

00:47:34
<transcript>: next why do we

00:47:37
thdxr: slept at 4am

00:47:41
thdxr: still in bed

00:47:46
glamshatterskull: we have chickens so when she's gone i make egg sandwiches

00:47:46
<transcript>: Next. Why do we have the same life? You ate candy for dinner yesterday. That's the other problem. I ate terrible while my wife was gone. Slept at 04:00. A.m.. Yeah, it's just a bad deal. It's just bad. Still in bed.

00:47:51
<transcript>: Hot pockets are not going to bed. It would not be okay.

00:47:54
2dorkstv: cheez-its for dinner.

00:47:56
<transcript>: We have chicken. So when she's gone, I make egg sandwiches.

00:47:59
<transcript>: Why don't you do that when she's there.

00:47:59
<transcript>: che

00:48:01
<transcript>: Cheese is for dinner. Exactly.

00:48:01
glamshatterskull: LUL

00:48:03
<transcript>: I feel like we've had.

00:48:03
<transcript>: the same life

00:48:07
<transcript>: The same life. Why do we have the same life? I feel like so many things.

00:48:07
<transcript>: it'll happen

00:48:11
glamshatterskull: cause she likes to make way better stuff

00:48:11
iannery: Searching for a wife so I get my shit together and screw it all up when she's gone for a week.

00:48:20
thdxr: we're quantum entangled

00:48:21
glamshatterskull: and who am i to rob her of her happiness

00:48:27
<transcript>: It'll happen to both of us. Same time. Like my wife gone last week. Your wife's gone this week. You know what it is, dax? It's interesting. I feel like we've had very similar lives, very similar careers. But you have this ability to take something from it and gain insights and stuff. And I have none.

00:48:38
2dorkstv: When my wife says shes going somewhere, I'm all like "So much time for activities!" Then I squander it all

00:48:41
<transcript>: I just don't. Why are you able to take your career and distill it and learn things from it? And I feel like I've learned nothing. I mean, I've learned things, but I couldn't tell you what they are. We're quantum entangled.

00:48:45
thdxr: I'm guessing I'm more of a BSer

00:48:48
<transcript>: Who am I? The robber of her happiness. Wait, what was it? Because she likes to make way better stuff. Got you.

00:48:54
<transcript>: Yeah, we ate out a lot. We never eat out when my wife is here.

00:48:54
<transcript>: she

00:49:14
<transcript>: She's really good about what we eat. But when it's just me, it was like, let's just go get pizza. Vegan pizza. We have a vegan pizza place in nixon, Missouri. It's not a vegan pizza place. We have a vegan Italian place. Okay, it's not fully vegan. They have a vegan menu. It's a husband and wife that own it. The wife is vegan. So they make non vegan things. But they also have why am I telling.

00:49:14
<transcript>: you all this

00:49:18
glamshatterskull: @thdxr that is a valuable skill

00:49:18
overra_dev: do you have kids dax

00:49:18
<transcript>: You all this. No one asked for this question. No one asked. I'm just talking.

00:49:24
<transcript>: Searching for a wife so I can get my shit together and screw it all up when she's gone for a week.

00:49:26
adjectiveallison: Tell me more about vegan itallian

00:49:27
<transcript>: That's funny.

00:49:27
<transcript>: when my wife

00:49:27
thdxr: yes I have a dog and two cats

00:49:33
<transcript>: When my wife says she's going somewhere, I'm all like, so much time for activities. Then I squandered all exactly.

00:49:38
<transcript>: There was a lot more time. I realized how much time.

00:49:41
<transcript>: When she's gone.

00:49:42
glamshatterskull: my coding issue is picking one of the 2038947 projects i wanna do

00:49:44
<transcript>: What am I going to do in the evenings.

00:49:44
<transcript>: just normally

00:49:45
<transcript>: Just normally we spend that together.

00:49:45
<transcript>: and it was

00:49:55
overra_dev: nice

00:49:58
<transcript>: And it was so many more hours. But I didn't exactly take advantage of it. It was just, like, wasted. Exactly like you just said, squandered. I'm guessing I'm more of a bsr. You're not more of a bsr. Dax.

00:49:58
2dorkstv: I apprecaited the vegan pizza sidebar :D

00:50:08
<transcript>: You actually have taken stuff that has happened to you and learn things that you can apply to future things. And I feel like I lack that. I don't know what that skill is.

<transcript>: Vegan baked spaghetti. They have like this vegan sausage they use on all of it. Vegan cheese. It's nice. Like Italian is not a food. You see vegan very often.

glamshatterskull: what isn't valid is chicago style tho

00:51:45
glamshatterskull: LUL

00:51:46
<transcript>: Than this. Yeah, sure. It's true. The story of Jason bourne, like the character is supposed to be from nixon, Missouri. That's where I live. It's a true story. I mean, he's a fictional character. So it's not actually claim to Fame. But Brad Pitt.

00:51:46

theruggedbear: what is this macbook redeem? üëÄ

00:52:31
<transcript>: A lot of the best pizza places. Do vegan. Yeah. In Chicago, I got a lot of good vegan pizza in Chicago. When we were there for, like, a company outside or something. I.

00:52:43
glamshatterskull: LUL Û†ÄÄ

00:52:47
<transcript>: Was an also New yorker. Vegan pizza is valid. What isn't valid is Chicago style. Oh, I just said something about Chicago style. I've had Chicago pizza. That's vegan. It's true. It was good. I mean, I've never had Chicago pizza. That's not vegan. So I don't know how it compares.

00:52:47
<transcript>: what

00:52:57
<transcript>: What is this? Macbook, redeem, rugged Bear. It is a chance to win a macbook. It's a zero 1% chance. So it's tiny. Somebody's going to win a macbook, though, and it's going to be super cool.

thdxr: Ethan hawk went to my high school

00:53:20

00:53:23
schererja: @thdxr At least your home town hasn't been known for Jeffery Dahmer lol

00:53:29
<transcript>: Am I the claim to Fame for the ozarks? I don't know about that. It's like a cheesy tomato bread Bowl.

iannery: It's not there haha

00:54:05
<transcript>: Sure enough. No description. Is there a description on any of them? Oh, no.

00:54:08
<transcript>: This is the code that's broken.

00:54:08
<transcript>: it's not

00:54:10
<transcript>: It's not there.

00:54:11
glamshatterskull: i think it means you can win a chance at a macbook

00:54:13
<transcript>: How about that.

00:54:17
glamshatterskull: but i ain't a scientist

00:54:20
<transcript>: Well, that sucks. I wrote this big, lengthy description, answering all the questions.

00:54:34
<transcript>: And apparently the code that updates these is not updating the description. So how about that? That sucks. Let's see if I win a macbook. Would that be funny if I won? Oh, my goodness, it'd be so funny.

00:54:39
<transcript>: That you guys would really think I was a scammer then, wouldn't you.

00:54:43
<transcript>: Unless you like explaining it. I do not like explaining it. So I need to figure that out.

00:54:44

00:54:47
<transcript>: Andrew, Bynum Andrew, Bynum.

<transcript>: no

00:54:56
<transcript>: No.

01:02:16
<transcript>: little

01:02:18
<transcript>: Little rant. Here.

01:02:30
<transcript>: No, the back end is not written in elixir. The server for the front end is written in elixir, but there's a difference in the back end and the server.

01:02:30
<transcript>: contrary

01:02:33
darrenbaldwin03: Pheonix?

01:02:38
<transcript>: Contrary to the popular beliefs of most front end developers, I'm not saying you this is not. I'm not calling you out.

01:02:38
<transcript>: yeah it is

01:02:41
<transcript>: Yeah, it is. Phoenix, actually.

01:02:45
<transcript>: I keep seeing this. We keep talking about next. Js.

01:02:45
<transcript>: and

01:02:48
grauwwww: Using liveview :D?

01:02:51
<transcript>: And the stuff you write in api routes being the back end. That's not the back end. It's not.

01:02:51
<transcript>: is this

01:02:53
<transcript>: Is this worth talking about.

01:02:53
<transcript>: dax i feel like you

01:02:56
<transcript>: Dax, I feel like you have good takes on this. Probably.

01:03:00
<transcript>: Dax? Does it bother you? Does it bother you? When you see all this.

01:03:00
<transcript>: like

01:03:03
<transcript>: Like we're putting back in code.

01:03:06
darrenbaldwin03: We are talking about BFFs here too

01:03:14
<transcript>: In our front end files. It's like that's not backend code. It's just like server glue. We were talking about Bfs. Here. Bfs. Who's bfs.

01:03:14
<transcript>: live view no

01:03:15
darrenbaldwin03: *server code

01:03:18
<transcript>: Live View? No, I don't think we're using Live view. Growl. I don't think so.

01:03:23
<transcript>: You know what if I'm going to be over here.

<transcript>: about

01:03:46
darrenbaldwin03: Are you serving astro from Pheonix?

01:03:50
<transcript>: About the difference in back end. I just like the whole front end industry. The whole front end cabal if you will.

01:03:52
darrenbaldwin03: Ur right imo

01:03:58
robert_jan: Oh noo.. Eating again. Mute :P

01:03:58
vimcerf: I'm just happy that you're not calling it middle-ware

01:04:09
dmmulroy: Things like NextJs and RSC create vendor lockin and extra infra concerns/work

01:04:09
<transcript>: I feel like they're trying to dumb down web development. They're not trying. I feel like they are dumbing down web development. This is not like elitist of me. I'm not trying to be like classist, like back end is better than front end. I just feel like the front end narrative is like trying to define everything involved in building a web app.

01:04:12
<transcript>: I think they're missing like most of it.

01:04:17
<transcript>: Am I dumb.

01:04:20
<transcript>: Am I missing something.

01:04:27
<transcript>: Seems like ncs and rc create vendor lock in and extra infra concerns work. I'm just happy that you're not calling it middleware.

01:04:28
aisebaxp: I think your larabar overlay isn't fit to the right screen size

01:04:31

01:04:46
camdickie: this being said, working with Spring backend stuff is something that i do not miss

01:04:53
<transcript>: Yeah, I broke something.

01:04:57
<transcript>: So.

01:05:00
<transcript>: I don't think Versaille gets to define.

01:05:03
<transcript>: Our next JS.

01:05:07
<transcript>: Everything involved in web development.

01:05:07
<transcript>: oh here's

01:05:10
<transcript>: Oh, here's, here's what I really want to say.

01:05:10
<transcript>: i should probably do

01:05:15
<transcript>: I should probably do this rant when I've had either no caffeine or the right amount of caffeine.

01:05:15
<transcript>: not

01:05:20
<transcript>: Not when I'm coming off of caffeine because my brain is a little slow, but here's the thing.

01:05:20
<transcript>: i

01:05:24
<transcript>: I asked on Twitter. I might even pull it up here. I asked a couple of weeks ago.

01:05:24
<transcript>: someone

01:05:25
dmmulroy: How dos RSC fit into a stack where there is one or more multiple backend teams that deploy to AWS or GCP? Now suddenly the FE team has to have special constraints around BE deployments/infra

01:05:30
<transcript>: Someone named me like an actually successful startup that's built on top of all this stuff.

01:05:40
<transcript>: Because you listen to Twitter and you would think everyone should build their app with versailles. Nextjs, T, Three and prisma and.

01:05:40
<transcript>: or trpc

01:05:42
<transcript>: Or trpc, or whatever.

01:05:45
camdickie: Notion?

01:05:58
<transcript>: This is your whole app and you can build it. And it'll work for millions of people. That's what you'd think if you read Twitter. But then show me a company that it's working for millions of people. And the one person that was called out, the one company that was pointed out was calm.

01:05:58
<transcript>: and then he

01:06:03
gitpush_gitpaid: thats why im using vite. my web app will be successful Kappa

01:06:05
<transcript>: And then he's tweeting over the weekend he's going to have to rewrite his thing or he's going to have to move off serverless because it's too slow, because prisma is terrible.

01:06:05
<transcript>: deploy

01:06:13
<transcript>: Deployed of herself. Just like someone. Give me one example of an actually successful startup that was built on top of this stuff.

01:06:13
<transcript>: the frank

01:06:14
tumtumpkinz: I think its silly when people pretend there is 0 downside to monorepos

01:06:16
<transcript>: The Frankensteck, if you will.

01:06:16
<transcript>: i don't know

01:06:20
<transcript>: I don't know I'm very old man yelling at the cloud right now, but.

01:06:21
theruggedbear: don't use Prisma. use Drizzle

01:06:24
glamshatterskull: twitch

01:06:27
glamshatterskull: jk jk jk jk jk jk

01:06:31
<transcript>: Just feels like the whole front end world, like a bunch of front end developers are trying to define software development right now, and they miss, like, half the picture, and they don't know it okay. I'm done.

01:06:39
<transcript>: That being said, working with spring back end stuff is something that I do not miss.

01:06:43
<transcript>: I've never done spring.

01:06:46
tardidriss: you don't have mouse?

01:06:52
cowfacedev: well, my company still uses express+raw html stitching for building full fledged apps

01:06:53
<transcript>: How does rsc fit into a stack where there is one or more multiple back end teams that deploy to aws or gcp. Now suddenly, the front end team has to have special constraints around back end deployments infra.

01:06:53
<transcript>: yeah

01:06:55
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't know.

01:06:55
<transcript>: i feel like

01:06:59
<transcript>: I feel like the whole React flash versaille world.

01:07:04
<transcript>: Feels like one big house of cards right now to me.

01:07:04
cowfacedev: be glad you haven't LUL

01:07:09
<transcript>: Feel like it's possible. It's all just a zero interest rate phenomenon.

01:07:18
<transcript>: So I'm using vit. My web app will be successful. There you go. Get push. I think it's silly when people pretend there is zero downside to mono repos. Oh, interesting.

01:07:22
<transcript>: Don't use prisma. Use drizzle.

01:07:22
<transcript>: tw

01:07:29
<transcript>: Twitch. Joking. Joke. And joking? What's twitch built on? Is twitch built on any of this? No, surely not.

01:07:29
<transcript>: you

01:07:33
<transcript>: You don't have a mouse? No tardy. I use a trackpad.

01:07:34
gitpush_gitpaid: what the hell is drizzle

01:07:44
<transcript>: Well, my company still uses Express Plus raw html stitching for building full fledged apps. Be glad you haven't. Yeah. So there's a balance, like between a good DX.

01:07:48
<transcript>: And a thing that scales.

01:07:51
<transcript>: Not even scales, just like.

01:07:51
<transcript>: it's not about

01:07:53
<transcript>: It's not about.

01:07:53
<transcript>: scaling

01:07:59
<transcript>: Scaling like cal.com. Their issue is not scaling it's, that their app is slow and people are complaining about it.

01:08:01
glamshatterskull: twitch uses a hodge podge of things

01:08:01
gitpush_gitpaid: my company uses next.js

01:08:06
<transcript>: Because prisma deployed to versailles is bad, and we shouldn't be telling people to use it.

01:08:16
<transcript>: Your company uses Next Jascot push.

01:08:18
cowfacedev: it's an orm @gitpush_gitpaid

01:08:23
<transcript>: I know lots of companies use nextjs. It's more just like.

01:08:26
<transcript>: The prescribed stack.

01:08:29
glamshatterskull: https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2022/04/12/breaking-the-monolith-at-twitch-part-2/

01:08:34
<transcript>: I don't know how many successful startups that have raised and have found product market fit are actually built on top of.

01:08:35
camdickie: i work for the bank of canada (our version of the FED) and we use serverless tools for our internal tools and just have a python api for calculations

01:08:37
<transcript>: This stuff.

01:08:37
<transcript>: it's one thing to use

01:08:39
<transcript>: It's one thing to use nextjs. It's another thing to use.

01:08:42
<transcript>: These specific things and kind of like ignore.

01:08:42
<transcript>: a dec

01:08:45
<transcript>: A decade of back end development.

01:08:53
gitpush_gitpaid: i mean im not at a startup but yea

01:08:53
glamshatterskull: "At the time of writing, most teams at Twitch own multiple services. The language of choice for server code is Go (Twitch also uses TypeScript, Python, C++, Java/Kotlin and ObjectiveC/Swift on other platforms). Each service environment is isolated in a separate AWS account, a pattern that we call ‚ÄúTiny Bubbles.‚Äù"

01:08:58
<transcript>: I work for the bank of Canada, our version of the Fed, and we use servo tools for internal tools and just have a python api for calculations.

01:08:58
iannery: I feel like there's a lot of the hip stuff in these frankenstack (and they're kinda good, don't get me wrong), but theres A LOT of inertia inside frontend development. The amount of people still using pre-historic CMS's like wordpress or joomla -- or even worse -- using Angular is surely overwhelming.

01:09:01
<transcript>: So serverless.

01:09:05
<transcript>: Also, I'm a huge fan.

01:09:12
<transcript>: So I'm not saying don't use serverless stuff. I'm saying versaille is not the only thing that is serverless.

01:09:19
<transcript>: I don't know what I'm saying.

01:09:22
overra_dev: i dont know where next/vercel prevents you from using other things as you need them

01:09:32
cowfacedev: @Iannery believe me, Angular isn't the worst LUL

01:09:34
<transcript>: At the time of writing, most teams at Twitch on multiple services. Language choice for sugarcoat is Go. Twitch also uses typescript, python, C Plus, plus, java, kotlin, and Objective cswift on other platforms. Each service environment isolated in a separate aws account pen and recall. Tiny bubbles, tiny bubbles.

01:09:38
darrenbaldwin03: NextJs is great if you leverage its server bits for data fetching etc -- then use a GO, rust, or Pheonix for ur actual backend

01:09:41
<transcript>: I feel like there's a lot of the hip stuff in these frameworks are in The Frankenstein.

01:09:41
<transcript>: and

01:09:51
<transcript>: And they're kind of good. Don't get me wrong, but there's a lot of inertia inside front and development. The amount of people still using prehistoric cms's, like wordpress or joomla, or even worse, using angular is surely overwhelming.

01:09:57
<transcript>: I don't know where next verse I'll prevent you from using other things as you need them.

01:10:01
<transcript>: Not true.

01:10:01
<transcript>: it's more

01:10:06
<transcript>: It's more the narrative. Ovara. It's not that using any one of these pieces of technology.

01:10:06
<transcript>: preclud

01:10:08
<transcript>: Precludes you from using.

01:10:08
<transcript>: actual

01:10:13
theruggedbear: @darrenbaldwin03 üëÜüèª

01:10:14
<transcript>: Actual back end stacks. It's that the narrative in front end is so like.

01:10:14
<transcript>: i feel like

01:10:17
<transcript>: I feel like it's so simplified.

01:10:23
<transcript>: It's all about dx, and you can have a great dx and move really fast, but.

01:10:29
<transcript>: I want to see real examples of startups that built their startup that way. And it worked out.

01:10:38
<transcript>: Like they moved really fast. I get it. You can move really fast. Well, you can also remove really fast. If you just learn any technology you can move really fast.

01:10:43
<transcript>: I don't know, I'm ranting and I don't even really know what my point is.

01:10:47
camdickie: I said this earlier, but Notion? i think they are profitable at this point

01:10:50
<transcript>: There's something that bothers me I'm bothered.

01:10:53
<transcript>: I'm not even entirely sure what it is.

01:10:56
<transcript>: But I'm bothered. Okay.

01:11:07
tumtumpkinz: Its more interesting to talk about the Frankenstack, its content.

01:11:08
iannery: old man yells at t3stack!

01:11:12
<transcript>: Cam. Dicky. I'm so sorry.

01:11:12
<transcript>: you're

01:11:17
darrenbaldwin03: Developer Experience is overrated.

01:11:17
<transcript>: You're saying I saw you say that earlier. I saw you say notion, question Mark.

01:11:25
<transcript>: I didn't know you were saying they were a company. I don't know what I thought. It's like you take notes in notion. I didn't know.

01:11:31
<transcript>: So notion that's interesting. They use this whole stack.

01:11:31
<transcript>: like

01:11:32
camdickie: They are built off NextJS i think LOL

01:11:34
<transcript>: Like this kind of like new modern.

01:11:35
nexxeln: im back what are we talking about

01:11:36
<transcript>: It's interesting because.

01:11:36
<transcript>: notion is social

01:11:37
<transcript>: Notion is social.

01:11:48
nihil2501: is it just me or is notion UX borderline unusable? it feels like sluggish^2 to me ..

01:11:48
darrenbaldwin03: Notion is slow AF

01:11:50
<transcript>: I mean, hasn't notion been like just drug all over the Earth for being so slow. I think they ended up making something faster. They rewrote some stuff to make it faster. But I can remember earlier's notion it being awful.

01:11:50
<transcript>: as

01:11:52
<transcript>: As a product in terms of slow.

01:11:58
camdickie: yeah its definitely slower than Obsidian, but its usable at this point

01:11:58
nihil2501: ok not just me KEKW

01:11:59
darrenbaldwin03: It still slow

01:12:00
<transcript>: I feel like the front end world.

01:12:03
<transcript>: Is like simplifying.

01:12:03
<transcript>: what

01:12:07
theruggedbear: Best example: look at Midjourney. Their search is not even working.

01:12:07
<transcript>: What is Web development to a detrimental state.

01:12:10
<transcript>: I feel like the narrative right now.

01:12:13
aaaaliou: For notion i's only their marketing and docs website IIRC

01:12:14
<transcript>: I pointed out, I'm going to pull it up on Twitter.

01:12:18
<transcript>: I asked on Twitter a few weeks ago.

01:12:18
<transcript>: a couple

01:12:20
<transcript>: A couple weeks ago.

01:12:20
<transcript>: how am i going to

01:12:21
cowfacedev: well, I've seen jira to be slower than notion LUL

01:12:22
<transcript>: How am I going to find this.

01:12:24
aaaaliou: not their main product

01:12:27
<transcript>: I asked for examples of a company.

01:12:32
<transcript>: That's built on what I call the frankensteck.

01:12:37
<transcript>: Examples of startups that have worked out.

01:12:40
nexxeln: notion made some optimizations recently

01:12:43
<transcript>: I'm going to find it. Hang on. This is probably the worst way to do it.

01:12:48
gitpush_gitpaid: definitely. i used to be interested in keeping up with things and this point i really dont care about anything new until i see job postings actually asking for it

01:12:52
camdickie: cmd + f 'examples'

01:12:56
<transcript>: Here we go. Honest question, not salty presuming. What's the biggest, highest valued, most Rev startup built on one of these? Frankenstecks? Anybody know? So I saw this.

01:12:56
<transcript>: and i just

01:13:01
<transcript>: And I just started thinking like everyone on Twitter seems to suggest that.

01:13:06
<transcript>: This is the way to build an app these days.

01:13:06
<transcript>: like just use

01:13:12
<transcript>: Like, just use all these bolt, all these things together. And you'll move so fast. And the dx is amazing.

01:13:12
<transcript>: et cetera

01:13:14
<transcript>: Et cetera et cetera. But.

01:13:14
<transcript>: i've consulted

01:13:21
nihil2501: well the frontend narrative is also this artificial world where taken seriously you'd be rewriting in new tech every 4 months. quite different from a "tried and true -> move on" approach to making software

01:13:33
<transcript>: I've consulted for so many startups. I've built a startup. I've worked with startups. I've been on the board of startups. I've been an advisor, a technical advisor to startups. I've done a lot of work with startups, and I've never seen one that was actually built on one of these stacks. So my question was honestly, like, someone just tell me, I need to know, what are the companies built on this stack.

01:13:36
<transcript>: One of the examples I got.

01:13:37
<transcript>: Was.

01:13:37
<transcript>: cow

01:13:39
<transcript>: Cow.

01:13:39
<transcript>: so

01:13:49
<transcript>: So versaille pointed out that Cal.com is written in a SEC. And what did they talk about over the weekend? How they might have to move off of herself. So again, I'm still waiting for one example.

01:13:49
<transcript>: oh wait

01:13:51
<transcript>: Oh, wait, super base.

01:13:51
<transcript>: i didn't see

01:13:56
gitpush_gitpaid: use all 50 of these things to build a website.... reality is 99% of those sites will never be deployed.... like mine Kappa

01:13:56
nexxeln: cal.com is just t3 stack

01:13:58
<transcript>: I didn't see this. Another great issue is superbase docs.com and actual product in one monorapo.

01:14:03
<transcript>: Cal.com is T three stack so.

01:14:03
<transcript>: next

01:14:04
<transcript>: Next.

01:14:06
darrenbaldwin03: Docs dont count LMAO

01:14:13
<transcript>: The question I have is maybe it's not T three sex fault because T three Sack doesn't say you have to use Prisma.

01:14:13
<transcript>: but

01:14:16
<transcript>: But you shouldn't use prisma, right.

01:14:16
<transcript>: is that just acc

01:14:18
rambo247: why dont people just use whatever is best for whatever they are building

01:14:24
nexxeln: prisma sucks

01:14:25
darrenbaldwin03: Prisma is terrible

01:14:29
<transcript>: Is that just accepted at this point? Like, don't use prisma and deploy it to versailles. If you're deploying to serverless functions of any sort, prisma is going to screw you real hard and your thing's going to be slow, right.

01:14:29
<transcript>: prism

01:14:39
thdxr: https://twitter.com/thdxr/status/1645428547064922113?t=KlOVGZCUnqancA7U47JCdQ&s=19

01:14:40
<transcript>: Prisma sucks. Yeah. So I think the problem is that a lot of people with this stack T three invariants of it just end up using Prisma because that's what it seems like you should do.

01:14:42
<transcript>: And it's not good.

01:14:42
<transcript>: well

01:14:45
binajmen: I didn't know that 1y ago. Trying to figure out how I'll switch to Drizzle..

01:14:52
<transcript>: Well, I built something. Aw, guests. I built that with T three. And I use prisma. And this is my first experience using prisma. Usually I use dynamodb.

01:14:52
<transcript>: the cold

01:14:54
rambo247: @thdxr LUL

01:14:56
<transcript>: The cold starts are awful like it's so slow feeling.

01:14:56
<transcript>: and i'm

01:14:59
<transcript>: And I'm not a fan of Prisma.

01:15:02
<transcript>: Oh, dax, you have a tweet.

01:15:02
<transcript>: i'm not actually doing

01:15:03
nexxeln: i do this now https://nexxel-has.no-friends.xyz/Discord_9IPeFa2FbB.png

01:15:04
<transcript>: I'm not actually doing Twitter time.

01:15:04
<transcript>: i will open

01:15:07
<transcript>: I will open your tweet.

01:15:07
<transcript>: what is happening

01:15:08
<transcript>: What is happening.

01:15:12
binajmen: Like, the migration from prisma is okayish, but I suppose there are alternatives

01:15:13
<transcript>: This is amazing.

01:15:13
<transcript>: i love it

01:15:15
<transcript>: I love it.

01:15:17
<transcript>: Oh, it's so good.

01:15:18
darrenbaldwin03: I get around a 3 second cold start with prisma deployed on Vercel

01:15:21
<transcript>: Has no friends. What is this? Nexel.

01:15:22
rambo247: didnt know theres a miami react conf

01:15:25
rambo247: should i go

01:15:30
<transcript>: Dax, what did you make that in? It's too good. I've already done this recycle project. I use prisma for schema and migrations. Oh, yeah. I saw your article about this. Next.

01:15:30
<transcript>: i saw

01:15:32
<transcript>: I saw your article about this.

01:15:34
goodgrandpaa: What a tech guru! Maybe FaceApp :P

01:15:36
<transcript>: Simple, nice use purposes and saying or maybe I didn't see the article.

01:15:36
<transcript>: i saw one

01:15:41
thdxr: ? that's just a selfie haha

01:15:43
gitpush_gitpaid: hes definitely going to be shilling with crypto and AI company with that type of pic

01:15:45
nexxeln: this is a bit different

01:15:46
<transcript>: I saw one where you used Kaisely. Like you use a combination of prisma. And Kaisely, right, dax, what did you make this in? It's just a selfie. No, it's not.

01:15:48
nexxeln: i don't even use kysely

01:15:49
<transcript>: That is so image generation, whatever.

01:15:54
<transcript>: There's no way that's just there's no way that's a real Photo.

01:15:55
gitpush_gitpaid: its like web dev got so simple that they overcomplicated it by adding all these new things. circle of life.

01:15:58
<transcript>: You don't even use kaisely.

01:16:00
rambo247: he wakes up like that

01:16:01
nexxeln: @thdxr did theo make this LUL

01:16:03
<transcript>: Let's see. I missed a bunch of chat.

01:16:03
<transcript>: seen jiro

01:16:06
thdxr: that's just midjourney

01:16:08
gitpush_gitpaid: shilling his*

01:16:14
<transcript>: Seen jiro be slower than Notion for Notion, it's only the marketing and docs website. If you recall correctly, best simply look at Mid Journey. Their search is not even working.

01:16:17
theruggedbear: drizzle for schema, kysely as qb

01:16:17
<transcript>: It's definitely slower than obsidian, but it's usable at this point.

01:16:17
maleero: That's the beard every man wants... damn

01:16:18
thdxr: nah me and Theo were sharing prompts yesterday lol

01:16:19
parkour_peter: hello everyone!

01:16:23
<transcript>: Dax, Old Man yells at T. Three sack.

01:16:23
<transcript>: developer

01:16:28
thdxr: honestly I can have that beard if I go to the barber

01:16:29
<transcript>: Developer experience is overrated. I think I agree with that, Darren. I think the trade offs.

01:16:29
<transcript>: i think

01:16:35
<transcript>: I think it's much harder to get good runtime perf characteristics that's much harder.

01:16:40
<transcript>: Or no. What am I saying.

01:16:40
<transcript>: i think

01:16:50
<transcript>: I think it seems to be a trade off between developer experience and good runtime characteristics, and we seem to always choose the dx, but I feel like.

01:16:50
<transcript>: we could add

01:16:54
<transcript>: We could add dx to the good runtime stuff, can't we.

01:16:54
<transcript>: can't we just

01:17:04
nexxeln: prisma is working on the perf on lambdas, the recently shipped an experimental feature called jsonProtocol

01:17:12
thdxr: drizzle killed Prisma anyway

01:17:14
<transcript>: Can't we just add, like a good developer experience on top of things that have good runtime performance, it's going to be harder for prisma to work up to good runtime characteristics than it is for something with good runtime characteristics to build a dax. So like drizzle, they start with like, what is a good runtime.

01:17:14
<transcript>: picture

01:17:16
<transcript>: Picture.

01:17:16
<transcript>: and then

01:17:20
<transcript>: And then start building toward the good DX. I think it's much easier to copy the good DX.

01:17:20
<transcript>: and

01:17:24
thdxr: yeah people are so bad at seeing where things can go

01:17:35
<transcript>: And I just think we've prioritized the wrong things. We try to make it really simple to start a new app. But is that what should be really simple? Dax, I feel like you should be the one talking right now. I feel like you have good takes here. Drizzle. Killed, Prisma.

01:17:38
thdxr: people can't see past drizzles rough state right now but it's obviously gonna be good

01:17:39
<transcript>: Me and theo were sharing prompts yesterday.

01:17:39
<transcript>: admit journey

01:17:41
goodgrandpaa: I love that we just have overlord dax up there tech guru'ing it up at us. Making sure we pick the right stack KEKW

01:17:47
kubahasek: I am back!

01:17:52
kubahasek: well we are looking at dax pics

01:17:54
<transcript>: Admit journey. Okay. Prisma is working on the perf on lambdas. The recently shipped an experimental feature called json Protocol. People are so bad at seeing where things can go, people can't see past drizzle's. Rust state right now, but it's obviously going to be good. Love that we just have Overlord dax up there tech.

01:17:54
<transcript>: guru

01:17:55
kubahasek: nice

01:17:59
<transcript>: Guruing it up at us, making sure we pick the right stack.

01:17:59
<transcript>: kuba's

01:18:00
kryotoboi: I wish Dax dresses up like this for the stream today

01:18:03
<transcript>: Kuba's back. We are looking at fake dax picks.

01:18:03
<transcript>: it's fake

01:18:13
<transcript>: It's fake. Like everything else on this channel. It's fake. Oh, that's my email. What am I doing? Okay, we got to figure out why email is not sending so bamboo Mailer.

01:18:14
nexxeln: i don't really like the schema syntax for drizzle

01:18:17
<transcript>: Bamboo Mailer.

01:18:17
<transcript>: go

01:18:19
thdxr: I have clothes like that

01:18:22
<transcript>: Go to definition does not work. I don't think my files are actually good.

01:18:28
<transcript>: I don't really like the schema syntax for drizzle.

01:18:29
nexxeln: also importing the tables to run the query feels awkward

01:18:33
goodgrandpaa: I can't even be a part of this convo since my app at work is legacy af LUL

01:18:35
<transcript>: How do I configure? Let's see neo vim.

01:18:35
<transcript>: neo

01:18:36
<transcript>: Neo v.

01:18:36
<transcript>: elixir

01:18:38
<transcript>: Elixir.

01:18:44
<transcript>: Do I need this.

01:18:53
darrenbaldwin03: Prisma schema + migrations is still the best -- its really prisma client that sucks here

01:18:54
<transcript>: What am I missing, dax? You ever do, elixir, any of them? I feel like you've done this before.

01:18:56
kryotoboi: @goodgrandpaa can't be more legacy than mine tho +

01:19:01
kryotoboi: LUL

01:19:07
<transcript>: Can you be a part of this combo? It's okay. Good. Grandpa. Neither can I.

01:19:08
thdxr: yeah but not for like 5 years

01:19:10
nexxeln: on mine it just worked by installing the lsp @adamdotdev

01:19:13
<transcript>: I shouldn't try to rant. I don't have enough thoughts. Enough coherent thoughts. All I have is like bad feelings.

01:19:15
<transcript>: I'm upset.

01:19:15
<transcript>: i don't

01:19:16
thdxr: did you install elixir deps and run it up once?

01:19:19
goodgrandpaa: @Kryotoboi Consider me curious haha

01:19:24
<transcript>: I don't entirely know why I'm just upset by the current state of things, and sometimes I probably come off really negative, like on Twitter and elsewhere.

01:19:28
<transcript>: It's not that I want to be negative, or that I want to just.

01:19:28
<transcript>: throw

01:19:28
nexxeln: you also need to install the lsp using mason or something

01:19:32
iannery: @thdxr yup, I felt that when using drizzle. It sure has a lot of potential but it's not at that "Wow look at that DX! Look how I love making simple SQL queries" people are saying rn.

01:19:34
thdxr: Adam tells me his bad feelings and I synthesize it, I'm like ChatGPT for adam

01:19:44
<transcript>: Throw rocks all day. It's that I feel like there's a lot of people being misled. That's what I feel like. I honestly feel like a lot of people are being misled. A lot of people that hang out on Twitter getting the wrong idea about the world, and it bothers me. It's a sense of injustice. Okay. That's what it is.

01:19:56
<transcript>: It's like companies that raise $300 million and have an outside voice out there. I feel like polluting the waters a little bit. I don't know. That's just a feeling I could be wrong. I should just shut up.

01:20:01
<transcript>: Adam tells me his bad feelings and I synthesize it you really are.

01:20:04
<transcript>: That's so true.

01:20:07
nexxeln: based adam

01:20:15
<transcript>: You also need to install the lsp using Mason or something. I installed the lsp. I did that. Did you install elixir depths? I did. And run it up once. Run it up once. What's that mean.

01:20:15
<transcript>: what do you mean by

01:20:18
<transcript>: What do you mean by run it up, one.

01:20:19
goodgrandpaa: @Kryotoboi We're on jsf 2.2 if that means anything to you LUL

01:20:21
<transcript>: Restart. Just restart this.

01:20:25
<transcript>: Okay, so, dax, here's. My bad feelings. My bad feelings are.

01:20:33
<transcript>: I need you to synthesize this. There's a point here somewhere, and all this mess of me talking.

01:20:33
<transcript>: there's a point

01:20:37
<transcript>: There's a point, and I haven't found it yet. And I feel like, you'll know what the point is.

01:20:37
<transcript>: but

01:20:45
<transcript>: But I'm bothered. I'm bothered by all the react ivory Tower nonsense. Like every time Dan speaks honestly, every time.

01:20:45
<transcript>: i'm

01:20:46
<transcript>: I'm so annoyed.

01:20:46
<transcript>: i'm so annoy

01:20:47
iannery: the worse thing about drizzle IMO is its docs.

01:20:49
<transcript>: I'm so annoyed? Why am I so annoyed.

01:20:49
<transcript>: i feel like

01:20:55
<transcript>: I feel like I've been lied to, not lied to I feel like I've been gaslit for a decade.

01:20:58
thdxr: I'm about to make fun of Dan so hard this week

01:21:05
nexxeln: is adam feeling emotions

01:21:07
<transcript>: And at this point, I'm just so tired of the React narrative. And we just got to wait for it. Just got to wait for it. It's all going to make sense if you just get your mind in the right place, react will make sense. No, I'm done. I'm done with react.

01:21:14
<transcript>: Like, I don't have to think weird ways to use technology. I should just be able to use my brain and use technology.

01:21:14
<transcript>: is adam

01:21:14
thdxr: sorry Adam I can't help you here, vercel is paying me now

01:21:16
<transcript>: Is Adam feeling emotions? I think so.

01:21:16
<transcript>: i think so

01:21:17
<transcript>: I think so.

01:21:18
thdxr: react is good!

01:21:20
<transcript>: I think next, this is the first time.

01:21:20
<transcript>: in my

01:21:23
<transcript>: In my entire 36 years that I felt emotions.

01:21:27
<transcript>: What happened here? Something broke.

01:21:27
<transcript>: something

01:21:28
dmmulroy: LUL

01:21:30
<transcript>: Something did not broke? What is this.

01:21:30
<transcript>: bro

01:21:35
<transcript>: Browser list? Or Is it working? Is it working.

01:21:40
<transcript>: Sorry, Adam. I can't help you. Never sell is paying me now. That was a good one.

01:21:43
goodgrandpaa: @Kryotoboi And spring framework 4.3 from 2016 lmao

01:21:45
nihil2501: I appreciate this earnestness

01:21:45
gitpush_gitpaid: i mean we are ignoring the real culprit here. google.

01:21:46
<transcript>: That was a good one. I don't think Brazil is actually paying right now, are they.

01:21:46
<transcript>: that's

01:21:49
<transcript>: That's a joke react is good.

01:21:49
<transcript>: i'm about

01:21:54
<transcript>: I'm about to make fun of Dan so hard this week. Please do. I'm sorry. It's not personal.

01:21:59
nexxeln: what are you gonna use instead of react adam

01:22:00
<transcript>: I don't know. The whole thing. Just the whole industry feels like.

01:22:00
<transcript>: it's been

01:22:02
<transcript>: It's been bought.

01:22:02
<transcript>: and

01:22:12
kryotoboi: @goodgrandpaa who doesn't know Jsf, PrimeFaces ftw ! LUL

01:22:13
<transcript>: And we're all just hearing what Big money wants to tell us honestly. It's starting to feel like that. It's starting to feel like this big, like you can't trust anything. It's all just where the money's flowing.

01:22:14
glamshatterskull: it feels that way because it has been

01:22:16
<transcript>: And it's all also, so pointless.

01:22:19
<transcript>: It's like the amount of.

01:22:19
<transcript>: pouring

01:22:25
<transcript>: Pouring money into trying to just convince everybody to use the same thing.

01:22:25
<transcript>: when you could

01:22:34
<transcript>: When you could use anything and build whatever you want and it really doesn't matter that much. Like just how much we talk about all these micro optimizations. What I feel like are micro optimizations.

01:22:38
goodgrandpaa: @Kryotoboi I actually use PF LUL We were on pf8.0 for the longest time, finally got to pf11!

01:22:39
grasp5533: is this about theo

01:22:41
glamshatterskull: and people fighting about it on social media LUL

01:22:41
<transcript>: Okay.

01:22:46
<transcript>: I'm going to try to put together a more coherent thought process here.

01:22:47
kryotoboi: LUL

01:22:51
<transcript>: Other than just I'm annoyed. I'm not an easily annoyed person.

01:22:51
<transcript>: i don't feel like

01:22:52
maleero: My problem with all of the javascript stacks is that they die too quickly and then businesses feel like they need to rewrite their codebase to use the new hip thing. It's happened to me so many times at places I've worked, starting with AngularJS. Absolutely massive codebase that management is okay rewriting. Makes no sense to me

01:22:56
nihil2501: I do think the ongoing framework pattern discussions are all good faith discussions usually, but it's also all exhausting YEP

01:22:59
goodgrandpaa: @Kryotoboi I've not actually seen another person know/use PF, love to see it haha

01:23:00
<transcript>: I don't feel like I'm just always annoyed at something that's not my identity. So I feel like if I'm actually annoyed and I have these feelings, there's something there. There's a reason for it.

01:23:00
camdickie: yeah thats a good point, like if you arent constantly creating things these micro optimizations arent going to improve your workflow in any significant regard

01:23:05
<transcript>: Here's one thing I'll tell you, and this is getting into spicy territory.

01:23:08
camdickie: just work with what your brain likes that lets you create

01:23:13
<transcript>: I'm convinced if I'm going to keep doing this whole content thing like I'm a Twitch partner. Now if I'm going to keep doing Twitch streams.

01:23:14
kubahasek: @nexxeln how'd you manage to become so good in so little time? kudos to you btw, would love to know you hahah!

01:23:18
<transcript>: And if I grow to have any kind of voice at all, I'm not going to take money from.

01:23:18
<transcript>: the re

01:23:21
<transcript>: The reacts the versailles of the world.

01:23:21
<transcript>: i just can't because

01:23:27
glamshatterskull: Clap

01:23:28
thdxr: I only started programming in 2022

01:23:29
<transcript>: I just can't, because I feel like then I would start saying, versailles is the best, and that would feel bad. Okay.

01:23:29
<transcript>: now this is like

01:23:32
glamshatterskull: cheers to that!!

01:23:33
<transcript>: Now this is like people who have taken money. I'm not like shaming them.

01:23:40
goodgrandpaa: @thdxr DAMN, prodigy?!

01:23:45
<transcript>: I feel like so much of the narrative right now is driven by venture capital dollars. And if there's one thing in this world that I hate more than anything, it's venture capitalists. I think that's probably where it all comes at. It all boils down to venture capitalists.

01:23:45
<transcript>: i really

01:23:49
nexxeln: @kubahasek i just built stuff, and hung out in programming communities and streams

01:23:56
kryotoboi: @goodgrandpaa I have lived a long life LUL. I used to write JAX-RS services back when spring boot wasn't a thing

01:23:56
<transcript>: I really have a problem with San Francisco as a city and venture capitalist as a people group. And I feel like they are influencing tech decisions in ways that make me uncomfortable.

01:23:56
<transcript>: okay i'm

01:23:59
<transcript>: Okay. I'm done. I'm going to stop now.

01:23:59
<transcript>: i really need

01:24:02
<transcript>: I really need to stop. I should have stopped a long time ago.

01:24:04
<transcript>: Okay.

01:24:07
glamshatterskull: standing for your own values isn't the same as shaming others. cheers

01:24:09
<transcript>: Dax only started programming. 2022.

01:24:11
rambo247: i think this hurts newer devs the most which sucks

01:24:12
<transcript>: That's funny.

01:24:12
nexxeln: frameworks are being "acquired" now

01:24:17
<transcript>: Oh, man, I missed a bunch of messages.

01:24:20
<transcript>: What are you going to use instead of react.

01:24:20
<transcript>: i guess

01:24:23
kubahasek: @nexxeln get that, wish I had more ideas for building things, really hate that icl

01:24:35
<transcript>: I guess it works out that I'm not right now working on a very interactive front end thing right now, I'm specifically working on a site where it's just a bunch of pages. And I'm okay if the page transitions aren't fluid.

01:24:35
<transcript>: i don't need

01:24:37
goodgrandpaa: @Kryotoboi sheesh, I am so glad I'm the age I am haha. Get to enjoy things being given to me and a lot of automagic processes.

01:24:41
kryotoboi: Petition to call VCs Vulture Capitalists ?

01:24:41
<transcript>: I don't need 200 JavaScript to make a paid transition. Nice. I'm okay with not.

01:24:48
goodgrandpaa: ^^ +1

01:24:55
<transcript>: So that just happens that I'm not really building something where I need a react or a spa like framework. But when I do build another front end heavy thing, I'll use solid, mostly because DAX.

01:24:55
<transcript>: i trust

01:24:58
<transcript>: I trust axe, but also just like the vibe I get.

01:24:58
<transcript>: the understanding

01:25:03
<transcript>: The understanding I get from it all I trust Ryan Carniato a lot.

01:25:03
<transcript>: i don't feel like

01:25:05
nexxeln: nice solid is great

01:25:06
<transcript>: I don't feel like he would say things just.

01:25:06
<transcript>: to

01:25:13
binajmen: Ryan is awesome

01:25:19
<transcript>: To gaslight me into believing his way of the world. He just knows how everything works. He understands all the frameworks better than most anybody. And I feel like I'll trust his opinion on how we should build front end apps.

01:25:24
<transcript>: Okay. I'm going to read a little bit.

01:25:25
thdxr: I've seen so many people who aren't heavy frontend people use solid for a few months then be like "wow why is everything so easy"

01:25:33
iannery: Solid sponsorship incoming!

01:25:40
thdxr: I'm sponsoring solid lol

01:25:43
<transcript>: My problem with all the job script stacks is that they die too quickly and then businesses feel like they need to rewrite their code base to use the new hip thing. It's happened to me so many times places I've worked, starting with angular. Absolutely massive code basement management is okay rewriting. Yeah, I do start to envy like the laravel.

01:25:46
<transcript>: Like PHP people.

01:25:48
kryotoboi: But do I trust Adam ? Kappa

01:25:50
nihil2501: I think Ryan's take is that RSC is the correct programming model haha

01:25:53
<transcript>: Do think the ongoing framework pattern discussions are all good faith discussions usually, but it's also all exhausting.

01:25:59
<transcript>: I think I have a lot of.

01:26:04
<transcript>: Weird personal grievances.

01:26:04
<transcript>: with

01:26:06
<transcript>: With employees at certain companies.

01:26:06
<transcript>: and

01:26:07
nexxeln: i kinda walla use elm tbh LUL

01:26:08
gitpush_gitpaid: google at fault here where everyone is looking for solutions to beat the competition to get ahead in the SEO race because you should be using SSR v.s CSR etc..

01:26:09
nexxeln: wanna*

01:26:12
<transcript>: And the culture at certain companies like the vibe that they put off.

01:26:14
luco_mo: @adamdotdev ho makes the art for statmuse?

01:26:15
<transcript>: And I mean, versailles is the biggest one.

01:26:17
<transcript>: I'm not going to try.

01:26:17
<transcript>: and

01:26:17
thdxr: Ryan's public take and Ryan's private take is a bit different haha

01:26:17
iannery: @thdxr should I try it dax, is that what you're saying?

01:26:27
<transcript>: And not call out versaille here. It's obvious I'm talking about versailles. So just the whole vibe around versailles, and the people that work there, it's just so robotic and so drives me nuts.

01:26:28
kubahasek: where do people go for ideas on stuff to build? (new topic idea lol)

01:26:33
<transcript>: I don't know why I'm so vindictive right now. I want to just get it all out.

01:26:37
<transcript>: But I'm really bothered? I'm really bothered.

01:26:46
<transcript>: Do you trust Adam? Maybe you shouldn't. I don't know. Seen so many people who aren't heavily front end people use solid for a few months, then be like, wow. Why is everything so easy.

01:26:49
thdxr: I feel it too, last few weeks have been kinda annoying

01:26:50
<transcript>: It's react is for sell it's all one big thing. And it.

01:26:50
<transcript>: just

01:26:51
<transcript>: Just.

01:26:51

<transcript>: Petition to call vc's vulture capitalists I love it.

01:27:06
<transcript>: I have firsthand. Oh, thank you.

01:27:15
<transcript>: I have firsthand experience with vcs so my opinions of vcs are not just from afar.

01:27:15
<transcript>: i've raised

01:27:20
<transcript>: I've raised money. I've raised a lot of venture capitalist dollars.

gitpush_gitpaid: some random tech blog: "Adam Dot Dev SLAMS Vercel and React"

01:27:27
<transcript>: Thanks for the follows.

01:27:35
<transcript>: Covazalek. Thank you for that follow. In Kentucky. I already saw that one. Okay? Nobody's following me because I'm just ranting. I should stop.

01:27:36
goodgrandpaa: 10M for statmuse, right?

01:27:40
<transcript>: I got twitch partner, and then I decided to just start, like yelling at people.

01:27:48
adamdotdev: !players

01:27:48
fossabot: The player illustrations on statmuse.com are illustrated by the magnificent Michael Walchalk (https://www.michaelwalchalkdesign.com/).

01:27:49
<transcript>: Luko, who makes the art for stat muse. It is Michael Walchock. I think I have like a command for it.

01:27:53
<transcript>: Iron's Public take and ryan's Private take is a bit different.

01:27:53
<transcript>: oh

01:27:56
<transcript>: Oh, I missed something.

01:28:02
<transcript>: Think ryan's take is that rc is the correct programming model.

glamshatterskull: top 10 reasons to hate vercel/react/life

01:28:13
<transcript>: Kind of want to use Elm.

01:28:13
<transcript>: google

01:28:13
nexxeln: 100% agree vercel is so robotic

01:28:22
<transcript>: Google at fault here where everyone is looking for solutions to beat the competition to get head in the seo race because you should be using ssr versus csr, et cetera.

01:28:28
<transcript>: Let me try and parse that Google it followed here everyone is looking why am I even on my screen.

01:28:29
thdxr: Guillermo shouldn't have cut his hair

01:28:31
<transcript>: I'm just talking right now.

01:28:33
thdxr: that's when it all changed

01:28:41
<transcript>: Google is at fault because everyone's looking for solutions to beat the competition to get ahead in the seo race.

01:28:45
<transcript>: Because you should be using ssr versus csr et cetera.

01:28:56
<transcript>: I mean a lot of things that people build don't care about seo. Like if you're building like an app.

01:29:00
<transcript>: For a pretty small group of people.

01:29:05
<transcript>: Your use case is not so much concerned with seo status.

01:29:05
<transcript>: com

01:29:15
<transcript>: Com SEO is our lifeblood. Like we get a million visitors from Google every day because of SEO. So our pages being served.

01:29:15
<transcript>: optimally

01:29:18
<transcript>: Optimally to Google is very important to us.

01:29:18
<transcript>: but most

01:29:20
<transcript>: But most apps don't have that concern.

01:29:24
<transcript>: If you're building an actual single page application.

01:29:24
<transcript>: re

01:29:27
<transcript>: React is great. I get it.

01:29:30
<transcript>: That doesn't bother me.

01:29:42
<transcript>: Ryan's public. Let's see. Should I try it? Dax, where do people go for ideas on stuff to build new topic. Good idea. Let's talk about something else.

01:29:58
<transcript>: Dax, you fill it, too. Last few weeks have been kind of annoying. Oh, I needed that validation. I needed to know I wasn't just, like, alone and feeling all these things because I don't know. My wife was gone for a week. I could just be in a bad mood. I could just be, like, grumpy.

01:30:07
thdxr: I think the problem is vercel is sucking all the air out of the room like it's the entirety of software

01:30:07

01:30:09
glamshatterskull: i think it's a rant that's been valid for a long time in a lot of different industries

01:30:15

01:30:15
<transcript>: I feel like there's people who want me to think a certain thing. And that drives me nuts. It's not. It's no longer grounded in, like, objective.

01:30:15
<transcript>: like

01:30:17
thdxr: when really it's a platformed optimized for e-commerce sites

01:30:18

01:30:37

01:30:43
<transcript>: It's just a little group here. We're hanging out and nobody cares.

01:30:43
<transcript>: and

01:30:48
<transcript>: And I don't even have a coherent thought, so it's not worth publishing.

01:30:48
<transcript>: or

01:30:57
<transcript>: Or aggregating or whatever. 10 million for sap News, we raised more like 20 million at this point. Our Series B kind of drug on for a while, but we were.

<transcript>: i'm going to

01:31:22
<transcript>: I'm going to start eating good again. She brought me this. This is nice. It's like a green juice.

01:31:28
<transcript>: 100% agree versailles, so robotic. Thank you.

01:31:41
<transcript>: Shouldn't have cut his hair. That's when it all changed. I think the problem is, roselle is sucking all the air out of the room. Like it's the entirety of Software. Yes, dax, that is it. You're putting words to my thoughts. It feels like.

01:31:44
<transcript>: They're trying, not trying, but.

01:31:44
<transcript>: somehow

01:31:49
<transcript>: Somehow they're defining software development. And it's such a tiny little.

01:31:49

01:32:01
nexxeln: i think you need to unfollow some people and follow some new people @adamdotdev

01:32:07
<transcript>: Couple that with the react gaslighting just like the react maintainers and the way they position themselves and the one true way. And everyone just needs to understand and see the light.

01:32:08
nexxeln: my feed isn't like this at all

01:32:12
<transcript>: Just Dan's tweet that just triggered me over the weekend. About, like there needs to be.

01:32:17
glamshatterskull: i had someone rant to me for like an hour about how much they love snowflake this weekend... i've never used it. has anyone here?

01:32:28
<transcript>: And like the incumbents, like X state, they don't see things the right way. They don't work really in the react world because they do things that are not the react way. So.

01:32:28
<transcript>: we need new

01:32:32
<transcript>: We need new state machine libraries to come out. Forget.

01:32:32
<transcript>: what everyone

01:32:48
<transcript>: What everyone's invested in or learned or contributed to over these years, we need to start over because it's not built for React. And then he says, but it doesn't have to be built for React, just like build it the right way. Use your brain the correct way. The way that react works.

01:32:52
<transcript>: I really hate that group.

01:32:52
<transcript>: honestly

01:32:55
<transcript>: Honestly, it drives me insane if I ever have a big platform.

01:32:55
<transcript>: like ever

01:33:03
<transcript>: Like ever. That's maybe a goal. I have a new goal. I want to actually have a big platform. I want to have a big platform so I can just do one little thing.

01:33:03
<transcript>: any little bit

01:33:04
nihil2501: feelings towards JS might be involved here too. the fact that 99% of job postings are in 2 mid languages

01:33:08
thdxr: snowflake solves some super painful problems so I get why people like it

01:33:12
<transcript>: Any little bit of contributing to just knocking that group off their little perch. That would be fantastic. I would love to have a following just for that reason. So if you all could follow me.

01:33:16
<transcript>: That'd be great.

01:33:19
nihil2501: JS eats the world is a sad eventuality

01:33:22
<transcript>: I'm not sure on the versaille robotic take. I enjoy following their employees building some cool stuff.

01:33:24
nexxeln: already followed

01:33:26
thdxr: I also appreciate it

01:33:29
glamshatterskull: @thdxr can you name a couple?

01:33:34
<transcript>: The drink looks tasty. It is tasty. Quite tasty. Chara is here. Howdy are you doing? Cool work? I'm doing cool work. Kind of. No, not really. Today is not cool work. Welcome to the world of privatized technology.

01:33:56
thechosenone1080: how to pronounce coc.nvim

01:34:02
<transcript>: Have you tried building something with laravel livewire or Phoenix Live View instead of all the js Libs so Stamp uses a lot of stat muses built with Phoenix, but I don't think we're using Live View for anything. We're still using React embedded in our elixir app.

01:34:10
<transcript>: Twitter is 1 million% that way. Where did that green smoothie material is from? My wife brought it to me. My wife is back.

01:34:15
<transcript>: Something that almost none of us are going to get rich building. Yeah, the ecommerce thing exactly.

01:34:27
thdxr: every company that gets big enough to start to need a data warehousing pipeline. that used to be really annoying to setup, you had to overpay someone like Adam to do it. snowflake just solves that in a completely serverless way

01:34:27
<transcript>: So kuba you're not sure on the versailles robotic take it's not that everyone at versaille is robotic. It's that the most vocal people are.

01:34:30
<transcript>: The ones that represent the company.

01:34:34
thdxr: Leerobotic

01:34:38
<transcript>: The most on Twitter. I think you need to unfollow some people. Unfollow some new people. Yeah. Nick, I think you're right. I think I'm just like I've got.

01:34:40
gitpush_gitpaid: im going to get rich building my web app Kappa

01:34:44
<transcript>: A bad state of mind about all this. I think I'm just following people that trigger me.

01:34:44
<transcript>: and

01:34:50
<transcript>: And I need to stop. You're feed isn't like this at all. I mean, do you follow Dan.

01:35:07

01:35:07
<transcript>: feelings

01:35:13
<transcript>: Feelings towards js might be involved here too. The fact that 95% of job postings are in two mid languages.

01:35:19
camdickie: if you follow prime and his circle you will get inundated with rust propaganda LUL

01:35:20
kubahasek: i do follow Dan, maybe I just don't know enough for him to trigger me lol

01:35:21
<transcript>: Snowflake solves some super painful problems so I get why people like it jse eats the world is a sad, eventuality.

01:35:28
<transcript>: I was ever bothered by javascript being talked about too much. I figure that is like a more innocent there's.

01:35:28
<transcript>: like innocent

01:35:30
<transcript>: Like innocent reasons for why.

01:35:36
kubahasek: @CamDickie good point, my feed is mixed with rust propaganda and react people lol

01:35:42
<transcript>: The Twitter sphere is so front end focused because most entry level programmers are working on front end stuff. And I don't agree with all the reasons for why that is. But I understand it, and I don't feel like.

01:35:42
nexxeln: here's a hot take, the only person who i get annoyed by in my feed is prime

01:35:44
thdxr: everyone follow me I like too much stuff to harp on any one thing

01:35:45
<transcript>: There's like.

thechosenone1080: just got back from my angular job (new) omfg the code is garbage and i hate writing frontend

01:36:00
<transcript>: Name a couple. What? Everyone also seems to see tech stuff on Twitter. All I kept seeing on Twitter was Donald Trump at the usc fight.

01:36:06
<transcript>: I just hate how everyone thinks they need react when most projects never need it.

01:36:13
thechosenone1080: finish curd backend in 1 hr spend the next 5 hrs with angular

01:36:18
thechosenone1080: CRUD*

01:36:18
<transcript>: Every company that gets big enough to start to need a data warehousing pipeline that used to be really annoying to set up. You had to overpay someone like Adam to do.

01:36:22
<transcript>: So true. I've set up a lot of data Lakes.

01:36:22
<transcript>: i've been

01:36:29
<transcript>: I've been overpaid a few times to set up data Lakes with kinesis and all that.

01:36:37
<transcript>: Oh, dax, with the yeah, he said what I wasn't going to say out loud. I don't know why I'm nervous to say things like that. Because.

01:36:37
<transcript>: no one

01:36:41
<transcript>: No one cares. I have no following.

01:36:47
<transcript>: But I don't know what to come off as like personal attacks. It's just like.

01:36:49
kubahasek: @nexxeln let me tweet that to him

01:36:52
<transcript>: As a company, they've chosen the path of.

01:36:52
<transcript>: the terminator

01:36:55
<transcript>: The Terminator or something. Their vibe.

01:36:55
<transcript>: is like we

01:36:56
thdxr: "I have no following" 16,000 followers on Twitter

01:36:59
<transcript>: Is like we want to look like Apple, but we sound like.

01:37:05
<transcript>: What is a good example of what they sound like.

01:37:05
<transcript>: i'm so

01:37:11
<transcript>: I'm so bad at analogies, I'm going to get rich building my web app, do it, get push.

01:37:13
nexxeln: i like him on youtube and twitch but twitter prime is something else @kubahasek

01:37:15
thechosenone1080: i have no bitches

01:37:18
<transcript>: If you follow prime and in circle you'll get inundated with rust propaganda. But the rust propaganda is just funny.

01:37:18
<transcript>: everyone know

01:37:18
jokestera_e: You all need TJ and Trash on your twitter timelines those two busting everyones chops makes my timeline funny

01:37:24
<transcript>: Everyone knows its tongue in cheek. We're having a good time here. You should use rust.

01:37:27
glamshatterskull: ...sounds like elon....

01:37:28
kubahasek: @nexxeln i do agree, man posts some interesting stuff sometimes

01:37:29
camdickie: yeah :P

01:37:31
gitpush_gitpaid: @thdxr do you like people talking about rust? Kappa

01:37:31
thdxr: they took the pretentious angle, which works when you're apple and you're releasing bangers and have a $1T market cap

01:37:39
<transcript>: It's just a joke. It's fun. I mean, obviously a lot of people really love rest for good reasons. They like the trade offs, whatever. But mostly the whole rust thing is just it's like a fun joke that you should probably use rest.

01:37:48
thechosenone1080: rust is a joke - adam 2023

01:37:50
nexxeln: @jokesterA_E agree, my fav people on twitter

01:37:52
anonymous_691: @adamdotdev https://www.youtube.com/shorts/oRSfT8wkLh8 this sums it up

01:37:52
thdxr: you can't do that when you're an unprofitable company for hosting frontends

01:37:54
<transcript>: It's not a joke when people try to explain to you that you're wrong because you don't think of the world through the lens of the guy who made redux. I do follow Dan. Maybe I just don't know enough for him to trigger me a good point. My feet is mixed with rest. Propaganda.

01:38:02
<transcript>: Here's a hot take. The only person who I get annoyed by in my feed is Prime.

01:38:06
<transcript>: I love prime so much, nicks. I do.

01:38:06
<transcript>: i

01:38:07

01:38:16

01:38:20
<transcript>: Oh, you're saying, like what I'm talking about right now is.

01:38:22
gitpush_gitpaid: is it? i was in a stream last night and made a joke about rust's new trademark policy and had a bunch of people snap at me Kappa i git_sad

01:38:27
<transcript>: Like people just saying the same thing over and over. And that's like nexus saying prime just talks about rust.

01:38:30
jokestera_e: Prime is too wholesome to hate

01:38:32
<transcript>: You're saying Follow dax. You say you talk about lots of things.

01:38:40
<transcript>: Just got back from my angular job. The code is garbage and I hate riding front end.

01:38:47
<transcript>: I have no following 16,000 followers on Twitter. Honestly, My Twitter.

01:38:47
<transcript>: my

01:38:49
<transcript>: My followers on Twitter.

01:39:02
lord_guccif3r: do you ever do hacking?

01:39:06
goodgrandpaa: SMOrc don't engage?!

01:39:09
<transcript>: I don't know why they're following me because they don't engage with my tweets. I think I just got I got all my followers from like, Five Tweets, like five viral Tweets. So the people who follow me, they really don't like me. They just liked one thing I said. So now when I say more things, they're like, who is this guy? I like.

01:39:09
<transcript>: him on youtube

01:39:12
<transcript>: Him on YouTube and twitch. But Twitter Prime is something else.

01:39:21
<transcript>: You all need tj and trash on your Twitter timelines. Those two busting everyone's chops makes my time funny. I do love tj and trash's Twitter. They both.

01:39:30
<transcript>: They're they're like every time I see a reply that they come in, it's always funny. Love it. I think prime is really funny on Twitter.

01:39:30
<transcript>: maybe

01:39:32
<transcript>: Maybe I just understand.

01:39:34
goodgrandpaa: I sent you my life story based on a tweet, idk how more engaged it could be Kappa

01:39:36
<transcript>: The tone that prime is tweeting through.

01:39:40
<transcript>: Man, my brain is moving so slow.

01:39:51
<transcript>: This lack of caffeine thing. I think I'm just going to actually end at ten at my normal time even though I started 2 hours late. Man posts some interesting stuff sometimes.

01:39:56
<transcript>: Do you like people talking about Russ.

01:39:56
<transcript>: they took

01:40:00
<transcript>: They took the pretentious that's the word pretentious.

01:40:00
<transcript>: thank

01:40:04
thdxr: @camdickie lol I saw that

01:40:07
<transcript>: Thank you, dax. They took the pretentious angle, which works when your Apple and you're releasing bangers and have a $1 trillion market cap. Exactly.

01:40:07
<transcript>: dax

01:40:10
<transcript>: Dax. Exactly. It works less.

01:40:10
<transcript>: when

01:40:16
thechosenone1080: prime remotivated me to do moar programming

01:40:17
<transcript>: When it's yet to be determined that you will survive when the vc money runs out, it works less. In that case.

01:40:17
<transcript>: and when

01:40:19
<transcript>: And when you're tying your future to react.

01:40:20
thechosenone1080: wish he was my mentor

01:40:25
<transcript>: Russ's joke. I didn't say russ was a joke.

01:40:25
<transcript>: i said

01:40:26
glamshatterskull: i don't like when things feel too cliquey... when i see cliques i tend to dodge. /shrug

01:40:32
<transcript>: I said when people make the meme about like you should use rest. That's a joke. It's tongue in cheek.

01:40:32
<transcript>: nobody

01:40:36
<transcript>: Nobody's actually like when prime says you should use rust for everything.

01:40:36
<transcript>: he

01:40:40
thechosenone1080: but they do say "never meet your heroes"

01:40:41
<transcript>: He's not actually saying that. You know what I mean? It's a joke. It's a meme.

01:40:48
jokestera_e: Can we all agree BrainF**k is the best language?

01:40:50
goodgrandpaa: it's a play on the cult mentality

01:40:53
<transcript>: Like he does love to use rest for a lot of things, but the meme is when he takes it to just use rest by the way, that's the meme and I see it as that I think it's funny.

01:40:57
<transcript>: You could argue.

01:40:57
<transcript>: what is this

01:41:02
gitpush_gitpaid: random tech blog again: "Adam Dot Dev SLAMS Rust"

01:41:10
kubahasek: no Prime likes morphing Rust to do anything he wants really lol

01:41:11
<transcript>: What is this? This sums it up a YouTube video. You could argue that people who are newer to the industry on Twitter and elsewhere, maybe don't understand the joke and they'll take it seriously and they'll be confused and they'll use rest.

01:41:14
<transcript>: Streger's. The best.

01:41:18
glamshatterskull: jokes are only as funny as the audience

01:41:21
<transcript>: Uber watching this. Okay. Hang on, hang on. We're watching this.

01:41:30
<transcript>: Thank you for this Tweet. One. I love Straeger. Two, he's going to complain about react, and he's probably going to put a lot of words into.

01:41:35
<transcript>: My head that I could not come up with myself. Here we go. Coming over here.

01:41:35
<transcript>: you can't

01:41:43
nihil2501: I'm a stranger fan

01:41:43
<transcript>: You can't do that when you're unprofitable company for hosting front ends. Exactly. Dax, thank you so much for putting words to my rant.

01:41:49
<transcript>: The rack stuff is more serious. Like I revolutionized my workflow.

01:41:53
<transcript>: Yeah system saying use Chakra over towing.

01:41:56
anonymous_691: @adamdotdev he has 2 other ones about the same topic, if you check his shorts on his channel

<transcript>: Made a joke about russ new trademark policy. I had a bunch of people snap at me.

01:42:04
<transcript>: i don't

01:42:07
nihil2501: not an autocorrect fan tho

01:42:10
<transcript>: I don't know what's going on with rust. I don't know. That whole rust trademark thing. I haven't read anything about it. Someone tell me what it is.

01:42:15
<transcript>: Prim is too wholesome to hate. I think prime is one of the best humans in the industry.

01:42:15
<transcript>: he's amazing

01:42:17
<transcript>: He's amazing.

01:42:17
<transcript>: he really

01:42:26

01:42:31
<transcript>: Good grandma. That's funny. No. Some people engage. I'm not saying nobody engages with my tweets.

01:42:31
<transcript>: just like

01:42:35
<transcript>: Just like I shouldn't have 16,000 followers. I think I should have like five.

01:42:46
<transcript>: Prime remote me to do more programming, which she was my mentor. Yeah, prime for best. Okay, I got to scroll a little bit, so play on the cult mentality.

01:42:49
<transcript>: Don't like when things.

01:42:49
<transcript>: feel

01:42:57
<transcript>: Feel too clicky. When I see clicks, I tend to dodge. Yeah, no, I think that's a lot of it, too. When something gets popular, I immediately hate it.

01:43:00
<transcript>: Okay. We're going to.

01:43:00
<transcript>: watch

01:43:15
<transcript>: Watch Straeger because Streger is in a world of things that annoy me. Streger is something that does not annoy me. He is fantastic. I got to watch it because I had a weird sleep schedule where my wife was gone. I got to watch some of his streams late at night for me.

01:43:15
<transcript>: and

01:43:17
<transcript>: And I like this guy.

01:43:19
<transcript>: I like him a lot.

01:43:25
<transcript>: Wait, can you guys hear this.

01:43:25
<transcript>: can you guys

01:43:27
<transcript>: Can you guys hear it.

01:43:31
jokestera_e: yes

01:43:31
<transcript>: Someone tell me if you can hear it.

01:43:31
kubahasek: ye

01:43:32
schrew: little quiet

01:43:32
goodgrandpaa: yes

01:43:33
gitpush_gitpaid: subscribed to "sesame street" Kappa

01:43:34
adjectiveallison: it's a little quiet

01:43:36
glamshatterskull: little quiet but we can

01:43:38
<transcript>: And obviously has two other ones. We're going to watch them all a little quiet. Yeah, I need to turn it up. I don't know how, though.

01:43:43
<transcript>: Volume. How do I turn up the volume.

01:43:45
<transcript>: Interesting.

01:43:47
<transcript>: Is it Max.

01:43:49
adjectiveallison: how to use computer

01:43:58
jokestera_e: Its annoying shorts don't have any controls other than play and pause

01:44:11
audy: Volume master add on

01:44:11
<transcript>: Wait. Here we go. There's an app.

01:44:20
audy: it amplifies audio

01:44:39
jokestera_e: @audy Ya if you're on chrome its nice

01:45:16
spotmonk: my shorts are under my pants

01:45:32
lord_guccif3r: so sorry i didnt said hacking in a bad way, im a red teamer and i just want to be better programing to build better implants. i think programing malware is fun :)

01:45:33
schrew: comic sans is the best tool 100% of the time

01:45:43
goodgrandpaa: Strager is great!

01:45:44
rambo247: strager the best

01:45:52
daglee: Strager? You mean programming Jesus?

01:46:19
daneoshiga: that's why python's moto is "second best tool for everything"

01:46:21
thdxr: NO WORK

01:46:21
goodgrandpaa: I've followed him since dec '21!

01:46:32
thdxr: bamboo is actually nice

01:46:38
thdxr: need something like it in js

01:46:39
kubahasek: there's still by building idea topic to go to while coding Adam

01:46:55
thdxr: so easy to convince Adam not to work

01:47:06
goodgrandpaa: @thdxr LUL

01:47:26
nihil2501: f

01:47:29
jokestera_e: Framerate drop

01:47:32
goodgrandpaa: maybe a hiccup

01:47:33
camdickie: it paused for a sec

01:47:38
jokestera_e: looks good now though

01:47:45
overra_dev: whats the alt

01:47:47
schrew: Apologize for your opinons, adam. Embrace the darkside

01:47:58
camdickie: uh oh

01:48:00
goodgrandpaa: irony.

01:48:00
kubahasek: and again

01:48:02
schrew: F

01:48:02
nexxeln: f

01:48:12
daglee: It was good until you said "is it good now".

01:48:13
thdxr: Adam let it out

01:48:18
nexxeln: no

01:48:22
jokestera_e: Adam mean? I don't see it.

01:48:22
dmmulroy: I think your saying what a lot of people are thinking and feeling

01:48:23
goodgrandpaa: It's the job for a community to be critical.

01:48:31
camdickie: ...we are good?

01:48:43
nexxeln: saved

01:48:59
thdxr: it's ok to express frustration and annoyance - there's a weird culture in America where that means you're bad or unprofessional

01:49:40
jokestera_e: I mean everyone should be opinionated in their field.

01:49:45
thdxr: that's why I clicked with Liz's family so well, latin culture is different you can say stuff that's mean in the moment but no one takes it long term

01:49:50
2dorkstv: it helps to say stuff out loud

01:49:55
dmmulroy: https://twitter.com/mitsuhiko/status/1645331685091729410?s=20

01:50:12
glamshatterskull: yes

01:50:47
glamshatterskull: that's how i think about a lot of streamers... a lot don't necessarily consider the responsibility towards their audience

01:50:49
thdxr: the question you can always ask is "do I reasonably feel comfortable disagreeing with X" if it starts to feel like you're punished for doing so something is off

01:51:02
thdxr: I feel like it's extremely hard to disagree with the world you're disagreeing

01:51:04
jokestera_e: You gusy should have a episode  on this. You are probably not the only one

01:51:05
nexxeln: i've never seen adam annoyed on a stream

01:51:25
glamshatterskull: no harm in punching up imho

01:51:32
thdxr: describing*

01:52:19
goodgrandpaa: You're pretty understanding I think.

01:52:43
thdxr: yeah if next is the default for react its really unclear what features only work on vercel

01:52:44
nexxeln: true

01:52:51
thdxr: I know how many people bail lol

01:52:55
thdxr: we see them all!

01:53:12
dmmulroy: This so much >yeah if next is the default for react its really unclear what features only work on vercel

01:53:19
thdxr: frank wrote a GIANT list on why self hosting NextJS is hard

01:53:30
glamshatterskull: that was an old comment LUL

01:53:33
glamshatterskull: yeah

01:53:49
iannery: I feel like Expo is kinda doing that to React Native.

01:54:28
glamshatterskull: you were talking about social media

01:54:49
yanteer: Whats the difference between programming and coding?

01:54:58
kubahasek: F

01:55:02
jokestera_e: Mini F

01:55:23
jokestera_e: screen is frozen for me but I can hear

01:55:32
thdxr: I cringed so hard at that normal curve meme with "just use vercel" coming from someone who has no experience with anything else. everyone committing loyalty to the overlord

01:55:38
schererja: Vercel is coming at you

01:55:42
goodgrandpaa: Nope :)

01:55:43
jokestera_e: seems ok now

01:55:49
kubahasek: aren't you not allowed to cross-stream under partner?

01:55:53
goodgrandpaa: All good now it seems

01:55:58
coolpantstv: If vercel ever got rid of the free tier like Heroku, it would die so fast lol

01:56:23
yanteer: No worries haha

01:56:24
goodgrandpaa: @thdxr Are they the same thing?

01:56:40
goodgrandpaa: (coding and programming)

01:56:40
coolpantstv: it would die

01:56:44
coolpantstv: not me lol

01:56:49
glamshatterskull: @kubahasek you can costream to certain platforms. twitch changed the partner contract last year

01:56:50
goodgrandpaa: @CoolpantsTV LUL

01:57:07
thdxr: idk coding and programming sound the same to me

01:57:10
camdickie: (i do not think they removed it, but changed it so you can stream on youtube, but not to both at the same time)

01:57:28
camdickie: but shhh with your -1 youtube viewers i think itll be ok

01:57:51
yanteer: Thanks for your positive vibes its very pleasing

01:57:54
glamshatterskull: in college we were taught this definition "Coding is a part of programming that deals with writing codes that a machine can understand. Programming is a process that creates programs that involve the ratification of codes."

01:57:59
kubahasek: @kubahasek i rememebr them getting hate for it, correct thing to do really

01:58:09
thdxr: some of the react threads remind me of an art critique trying to explain why something ugly is actually good

01:58:22
tsoutsou_proutsou: @adamdotdev hey buddy :)

01:58:31
goodgrandpaa: Q: Can I stream simultaneously on other platforms or services, also known as simulcasting? A: We do not allow simulcasting on web-based, Twitch-like services that support streaming for extended periods of time, such as YouTube and Facebook, because we believe engaging with two streams at once can lead to a sub-optimal experience for your community. However, we know many of you want to use other services to grow your community, so simulcasting on short form, mobile services, such as TikTok or In

01:58:36
yanteer: No its not sarcasm

01:58:42
goodgrandpaa: Instagram Live, is allowed.

01:58:49
maleero: I've felt exactly the same way for a very long time. It's really good to hear other people say what I'm thinking!

01:59:00
kubahasek: damn so they did not remove it

01:59:29
tsoutsou_proutsou: @GoodGrandPaa and tiktok

01:59:36
yanteer: xD

01:59:46
goodgrandpaa: @tsoutsou_proutsou That's at the end of the first message :)

01:59:55
coolpantstv: I've been kinda weary ever since the propaganda of making apps with tightly coupled frontends and backends has been pushed hard. I really like having a standalone api and my frontend

01:59:58
manbravegg: we all need some therapy in this industry lol

02:00:09
tsoutsou_proutsou: @GoodGrandPaa oh did not reach this point :D

02:00:12
iannery: It affects me!

02:00:16
thdxr: lets make a support group stream "do you feel overwhelmed by vercel"

02:00:29
goodgrandpaa: @tsoutsou_proutsou No worries! It reached a char limit, so I had to type in the last little bit.

02:00:29
yanteer: Have you ever heard of SAP?

02:00:34
kryotoboi: Is vercel bad ?

02:00:42
gitpush_gitpaid: what is cal.com

02:00:50
kryotoboi: Should I not continue with Next anymore ?

02:00:54
nexxeln: @gitpush_gitpaid go to cal.com LUL

02:01:03
kubahasek: wait what happened to cal.com?

02:01:13
gitpush_gitpaid: @gitpush_gitpaid yea. seems like its a calendar. what is the issue they ran into

02:01:32
camdickie: frontend engineers try not to be cringe challenge (i am a front end dev)

02:01:32
iannery: @gitpush_gitpaid it stuttered a lot when scrolling

02:01:45
nexxeln: adam you have inspired me to fully move to ocaml/haskell server + elm frontend

02:01:45
thdxr: what's annoying for me is everyone is focusing on problems that aren't going to make them RICH

02:01:51
thdxr: Rich Driven Development

02:02:01
coolpantstv: @thdxr when are you posting a money spread?

02:02:10
nexxeln: @gitpush_gitpaid slow lambdas

02:02:18
thdxr: no one is paying you $$$$$ because you're good at deploying NextJS to Vercel

02:02:29
thdxr: they're paying you to build vercel

02:02:34
gitpush_gitpaid: also, vercel didnt do itself favors coming for that dude for $3k last week

02:02:44
glamshatterskull: ding ding ding ding

02:02:46
camdickie: Big Brother React is literally 1984

02:02:46
basileus__: Have you used Vercel between 2015-2023? If so, you may be entitled to compensation

02:04:08
kryotoboi: Why am I still deploying to Netlify ?

02:04:08
yanteer: haha

02:04:23
goodgrandpaa: How can I make your money? Kappa

02:04:27
coolpantstv: Just our money by scamming us

02:04:34
iannery: I'm primarily a mobile developer. Unfortunately in startups you have to be a mobile developer, frontend, backend, infra, etc etc etc to make it work. I chose to use the frankenstack to our webapp cuz of the DX propaganda and stuff and oh boy I was SO disappointed

02:04:35
glamshatterskull: cause integrity is important

02:04:38
gitpush_gitpaid: damn. standup. stream might end before im back. catch yall later if anything.

02:04:38
thdxr: twitter short factor in net worth into the algorithm

02:04:40
thdxr: should*

02:04:44
glamshatterskull: and integrity is also rare

02:04:45
thdxr: that would fix things

02:04:56
kryotoboi: I think I need to make my own money as well. Earning is too hard NotLikeThis

02:05:01
darrenbaldwin03: @thdxr lmao

02:05:28
thdxr: Twitter should factor in how nice your house is decorated into the algorithm

02:05:35
thdxr: then me and adam would rule the world

02:05:36
glamshatterskull: no... i am not... integrity is v rare these days.

02:05:38
overra_dev: @thdxr uyes

02:06:30
coolpantstv: "I should get off before I say something bad" 1 min later "no one should listen to poor people"

02:06:38
goodgrandpaa: Facts

02:06:52
thdxr: people who don't even work at vercel tell people to use vercel more than I tell people to use SST

02:07:04
thdxr: what's the deal with that!?

02:07:10
astrojules: hi adam yummsaHappyTotodile

02:07:15
techdufus: L

02:07:22
dnbull: twitter is such a small bubble and doesn't really reflect the engineer world ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

02:07:26
coolpantstv: @thdxr products speak for themsleves

02:07:29
nexxeln: do you think rsc is just a thing to make vercel more money by raising the server bills

02:07:48
thdxr: The problem is twitter goes through phases, there was a time where it felt more rich

02:08:06
coolpantstv: I feel like companies that make it but have bad marketing are the best. The product does the heavy lifting instead of hype..

02:08:13
glamshatterskull: inb4 vercel blue

02:08:16
thdxr: no no I meant rich in info

02:08:17
thdxr: hahah

02:08:22
thdxr: "vibrant"

02:08:23
maleero: LUL

02:08:28
kryotoboi: Anytime I open, every other tweet just gives me anxiety

02:08:42
thdxr: @CoolpantsTV crap, we've been making our marketing better should we make it worse?

02:08:50
yanteer: How important is Math for Software Engineering?

02:08:56
glamshatterskull: i am glad i have moved off twitter LUL

02:08:57
dnbull: twitter tech is just a battle on who wants to be the smartest

02:09:04
nexxeln: this is just my first week on twitter

02:09:14
iannery: The offer of "here's an api folder that works just like an api, make your api with nextjs now!" was really enticing for me also (since mobile dev is more leaned towards frontend than backend). At the moment I'm still at the base of the learning curve but I feel like all the DX people talk about is directed towards simple projects rather than complex shit (e.g. prisma issues)

02:09:16
thdxr: delete the vod, free yourself

02:09:17
coolpantstv: @thdxr you guys went the right direction, product then marketing instead of the other way around

02:09:32
camdickie: nah adam farm the content Kappa

02:09:45
thdxr: idk if you at all feel weird delete the vod

02:09:50
thdxr: not worth it being on your mind

02:09:55
thdxr: @nexxeln twitter was good until you joined

02:10:04
goodgrandpaa: @thdxr LUL

02:10:04
nexxeln: i ruined it confirmed

02:10:06
glamshatterskull: i left twitter and only do discourse on mastodon and it's been so refreshing interacting with adults

02:10:15
2dorkstv: I left twitter a while ago. I'm over on fosstodon.org (mastodon) now and I'm happy with it

02:10:21
coolpantstv: @adamdotdev you will be an outcast when we all have vercel chips in our heads and this vod resurfaces

02:10:53
goodgrandpaa: Time for adam to create his own forum for learning and discourse Kappa

02:10:58
traylortrash84: Good morning.

02:11:05
thdxr: "feeling cute, might delete the vod later"

02:11:08
coolpantstv: we wont tell

02:11:08
glamshatterskull: talking about thoughts is how we form them

02:11:15
glamshatterskull: i think it's good discourse

02:11:31
kryotoboi: I feel pretty bad NotLikeThis

02:11:33
thdxr: nah I gotta do some work gonna stream later

02:11:36
longhumans: I found it helpful tbh, as a newer dev

02:11:50
goodgrandpaa: I love the neck grab "feelin' cute, might delete later" LUL

02:11:50
iannery: Why are you closing stream, you want us to feel bad? BibleThump

jokestera_e: studytime and lana_lux is on

thdxr: daniel roe wanted to do a between 2 nerds thing with me

02:12:38

iannery: see ya!

02:12:40
schrew: I love lamp

02:12:42
nexxeln: byeeee

02:12:46
goodgrandpaa: "maybe we can do it again sometime" LUL

02:12:55
nexxeln: moral of the stream: LAMP STACK GOATED

02:12:56
goodgrandpaa: Sounds like a "it's not you, it's me." scenario

02:13:05
jokestera_e: stream still managing an F just at the end lol

02:13:36
goodgrandpaa: Squeezing out the f's haha @jokesterA_E
