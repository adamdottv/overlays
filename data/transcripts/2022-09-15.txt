<transcript>: that's what

00:14:59
<transcript>: That's what this last two streams has been about.

00:15:07
theo: I’ve been sitting on an AWS game idea for awhile now

00:15:11
<transcript>: I like Wordle. No, it's like you see a service icon and you have to guess what service it is. You have like multiple choice, which AWS of all the 300 services, which services it.

00:15:11
<transcript>: oh you've got

00:15:19
theo: “Deploy The Game”

00:15:21
<transcript>: Oh, you've got an AWS game idea. Oh, I want to hear all about it. Somebody on the stream. Someone from Chat Cub is came up with the name AW. Guess I think I'm gonna make multiple games actually.

joostschuur: Is the game 'guess your serverless bill this month?'

00:15:39
<transcript>: Or deploy the game like you have to deploy it before you can play it.

00:15:41
theo: Where you have to deploy the game

00:15:43
<transcript>: A fake AWS console that sounds fantastic, actually.

00:15:43
<transcript>: there are so many

00:15:48
<transcript>: There are so many parody things you could do. You have to deploy the game. That is awesome. I love it.

00:15:51
<transcript>: Deuce is here.

00:15:51
<transcript>: guess your

delvoid: night Theo

00:16:36
<transcript>: I was trying to see, like, do I still have all of my streams that I record them all because I know Twitch starts getting rid of them.

00:16:48
<transcript>: And I do have I have them on my machine. I recorded them in OBS. So you guys are going nuts with all of the all of this thing you're putting on me.

00:16:48
<transcript>: now snake

00:16:50
<transcript>: Now Snake, that was just wasteful.

00:16:50
<transcript>: it was

00:16:59
<transcript>: It was already. You know, the Ray bands were already on my face. You redeemed it so I could just waste this 500 points. I feel guilty. Like I should give them back to you somehow.

00:16:59
<transcript>: i don't

00:17:01
<transcript>: I don't think I can, though.

00:17:03
stroopwafel26: how much storage does that eat up?

00:17:05
<transcript>: Yeah. I went back and watched my first stream. It was a banger.

00:17:05
<transcript>: i'll tell you what

00:17:07
<transcript>: I'll tell you what.

00:17:07
<transcript>: how much storage i

00:17:07
0xvivek: bad hair's the best

00:17:11
niftynate80: I need to control my caffeine intake it messes with my psychic energy

00:17:16
<transcript>: How much storage I've got, like a 50 terabyte network storage thing in my closet, in my rack. So I think I'm good on storage, but.

00:17:16
<transcript>: i do need

00:17:23
<transcript>: I do need to look it's. One of the things I need to do is I need to go through and organize my video stuff. So I got a bunch of it piling up.

00:17:23
stroopwafel26: 50TB? nice

00:17:30
<transcript>: Better is the best control. You're in caffeine and say, hey, I'm drinking caffeine today. I decided.

00:17:30
<transcript>: i'm a caffeine

00:17:32
shn4ke: you can in mod view if you haven't approved

00:17:33
<transcript>: I'm a caffeine person. Forget about it, okay.

00:17:33
<transcript>: i was trying

00:17:38
<transcript>: I was trying to like be cool and not do use caffeine and I did it for like a year.

00:17:38
<transcript>: but

00:17:43
<transcript>: But caffeine's nice makes you feel good. So many positive side effects of caffeine.

00:17:43
<transcript>: what are the

00:17:47
<transcript>: What are the negatives, like anxiety, sweaty palms.

00:17:48
nutlesssquirrel: Twitch gets rid of them... visually. If you have the URL you can somehow still grab it off their servers. I think... Someone told me that once.

00:17:51
<transcript>: That's not really a negative. Those are minor.

00:17:51
<transcript>: all the

00:17:56
<transcript>: All the positives, increased mood, decreased appetite.

00:17:58
<transcript>: Increased focus.

00:17:58
<transcript>: the

00:18:01
<transcript>: The problem is when you have caffeine every day.

00:18:01
<transcript>: and then

00:18:06
<transcript>: And then you just need it to be like normal plane of existence. That's the problem.

00:18:12
bearsample: @niftynate80 it's a drug, lets put it that way

00:18:12
<transcript>: Yeah. So my first. My first dream was with something.

00:18:12
<transcript>: it was something

00:18:18
<transcript>: It was something my first two weeks of streams. I don't know why anyone. I guess no one suck around.

00:18:18
<transcript>: i just

00:18:22
<transcript>: I just. I was just talking about no one's here from the early days.

00:18:31
<transcript>: Not that I'm, like, good at it now, but like at least we figured something's out. We've got some stuff that works on my stream.

00:18:35
<transcript>: And didn't have anything working on the first 1st couple weeks.

00:18:43
<transcript>: All right, let's let's build, let's build the thing. So you need to control your caffeine ticket. Messes with your psychic energy.

00:18:43
<transcript>: interesting

00:18:46
niftynate80: @bearsample I never got into amphetamines like they gave people for ADD

00:18:48
<transcript>: Interesting. Nifty. Eight. I would like to know more about your psychic energy.

00:18:52
<transcript>: You can in mod view. I have them automatically approving them.

00:19:02
<transcript>: Sorry. I'm sorry you lost this. I'll give you some more Ray bands later. We'll just give them to you for free. I'll turn them on for five minutes. Just. I'll have to remember.

00:19:03
stroopwafel26: now go build, like the werner vogels video series

00:19:09
<transcript>: Just because visually, if you have the girl, you can somehow still grab it off their servers. Really.

00:19:12
<transcript>: Interesting. Hey, thanks for the follow Tinker think.

00:19:12
<transcript>: tink

00:19:18
<transcript>: Tinker and sink, not just tinker or think, ticker and think.

00:19:30
<transcript>: It is a drug. Caffeine is a drug. It's a legal drug. It's a drug that we're all okay with. We've all decided this one caffeine. We're okay with this drug.

00:19:30
<transcript>: those are the drugs

00:19:32
<transcript>: Those are the drugs. Get out of here with those drugs.

00:19:32
<transcript>: but this one

<transcript>: checks out

00:19:35

00:21:32
<transcript>: Wrong Cam link. Maybe I've got too many Can links. There it is.

00:21:34
stroopwafel26: It's not you, it's the dual OBS and macOS upgrade :P

00:21:35
<transcript>: We did it.

00:21:35
<transcript>: alright

00:21:36
<transcript>: Alright.

<transcript>: Kitty normally opens. Yeah. Here it is.

00:22:00
<transcript>: i don't know why

00:22:07
<transcript>: I don't know why this does this. Whenever I get Rick rolled, I really need to look at that script again. It does some weird stuff.

00:22:07
<transcript>: it opens

00:22:09
<transcript>: It opens, Kitty.

00:22:12
<transcript>: Okay.

00:22:51
<transcript>: it's getting ready to do

00:23:04
<transcript>: It's getting ready to do that, you know? And then you just kind of jump me into it. And here we are. It's kind of like a little bit of a, like, bad taste, like an aftertaste in that whole experience. But if it was good for you all, it was good for me.

00:23:18
<transcript>: It's the dual OBS and Mac OS upgrade. Yeah, I did. Update. I did go onto the beta of Mac OS. Probably a bad idea. What was this Invalid JSON response Spotify? Uhoh.

00:23:20

00:23:24
<transcript>: The Spotify works play some music and see.

00:23:25

00:23:36
<transcript>: We're good.

00:23:36
<transcript>: all right

00:23:39
<transcript>: All right, that reminded me to play music anyway. Cool.

00:23:49
<transcript>: Like the buttons at the green dropdown. Looks good. Maybe change them to be Orange. Yeah. Yeah. True. We're gonna definitely we're gonna make the color scheme very AWS. Like.

00:23:49
<transcript>: maybe

00:23:51
cowfacedude99: it's this script. https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/blob/master/bin/.local/scripts/tmux-sessionizer It starts a new session per project and switch between the them.

00:23:52
<transcript>: Maybe an Orange. All of that.

00:23:54
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:24:06
<transcript>: Didn't mean right? You're fine, Laden, you're fine. It's this script. Oh, Paramagin has a sorts of new session per project and switch between them. Ooh.

00:24:10
<transcript>: Anything from Primagin. You know, I'm here for it.

00:24:15
<transcript>: T Max sessionizer.

00:24:18
<transcript>: So how does this get run.

00:24:27
<transcript>: So I'll select a name based names like that. Okay, what happens? T Max running.

00:24:27
bearsample: Primeagen is nuts

00:24:29
cowfacedude99: you add it to the bin.

00:24:31
<transcript>: T. Max New session.

00:24:36
<transcript>: Okay. So if the session already exists.

00:24:41
<transcript>: I see, I see.

00:24:49
stroopwafel26: prime uses i3? i love i3

00:24:50
<transcript>: So it finds the project, and it like changes the working directory or something. What's this.

00:24:57
shn4ke: any good guide to learn tmux

00:24:58
<transcript>: Trying to understand.

00:24:58
<transcript>: how

00:25:01
<transcript>: How this works.

00:25:06
<transcript>: You add it to the bin. Oh.

00:25:09
<transcript>: You add it to bin.

00:25:12
<transcript>: And then.

00:25:15
<transcript>: You call tmux.

00:25:15
<transcript>: sessionize

00:25:17
cowfacedude99: finds project, changes working directory and starts a new session.

00:25:18
<transcript>: Sessionizer seems a little lengthy.

00:25:18
<transcript>: what do you call

00:25:20
<transcript>: What do you call.

00:25:20
<transcript>: like what would i

00:25:22
<transcript>: Like, what would I type in here.

00:25:22
<transcript>: to use

00:25:27
<transcript>: To use this bin. I guess that's what you. That's what it would be. Timuck sessionizer.

00:25:27
<transcript>: and then

00:25:30
<transcript>: And then you pass it a.

00:25:30
<transcript>: selected

00:25:31
<transcript>: Selected.

00:25:42
<transcript>: I'm not fully understanding what's going on here.

00:25:49
cowfacedude99: I have it mapped to prefix s.

00:25:51
<transcript>: I'm just not very good at bash and things finds Project Change is working directory and starts in your session. That's actually awesome. I love that.

00:25:51
<transcript>: i'm going to

00:25:52
cowfacedude99: c-s

00:25:59
<transcript>: I'm going to put it in my bin right now. Have it mapped to prefix S, period. So control s. Okay.

00:26:01
<transcript>: Okay.

00:26:01
<transcript>: let's do it

00:26:02
<transcript>: Let's do it.

00:26:02
<transcript>: let's

00:26:04
<transcript>: Let's do it.

00:26:07
<transcript>: We'll do touch.

00:26:10
<transcript>: Where is he? Habit.

00:26:12
<transcript>: Like user bin.

00:26:12
<transcript>: so

00:26:14
<transcript>: So like touch.

00:26:17
<transcript>: Wait.

00:26:21
<transcript>: No like in user.

00:26:21
<transcript>: like this

00:26:22
<transcript>: Like this.

00:26:22
<transcript>: mike here

00:26:23
<transcript>: Mike, here.

00:26:26
<transcript>: Local.

00:26:32
cowfacedude99: If you don't pass anything, it goes through all the things.

00:26:35
<transcript>: They're already a script directory. Do I need to create that directory? Tmux session Iser session Iser.

00:26:39
<transcript>: Does that work? No such file or directory.

00:26:39
<transcript>: list

00:26:41
<transcript>: List User bin.

00:26:41
<transcript>: local

00:26:43
<transcript>: Local.

00:26:47
<transcript>: No, I'm totally wrong. What is? Linux.

00:26:47
cowfacedude99: I would put it in ~/.local/bin/script

00:26:50
<transcript>: User bin.

00:26:54
<transcript>: Put in local oh, okay local bin script cool.

00:26:58
cowfacedude99: scriptname*

00:26:59
<transcript>: Yeah, that's what I was thinking. That's what I was thinking. Cafes. That's what I was thinking.

00:27:03
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow VJ.

00:27:03
vj525: cat vj525 >> followers.txt

00:27:05
<transcript>: So we're gonna do touch.

00:27:08
<transcript>: Local.

00:27:12
stroopwafel26: but then you'd have to add ~/.local/bin to $PATH

00:27:12
<transcript>: Script.

00:27:12
<transcript>: script

00:27:14
<transcript>: Script, scripts.

00:27:16
<transcript>: Slash.

00:27:23
stroopwafel26: I'd put it in $(brew --prefix)

00:27:25
<transcript>: Oh, I'd have to add local bins to pass. Okay, that sounds annoying, but I could. I could do that. Let's just see what path has right now. Echo.

00:27:27
<transcript>: Pass.

00:27:27
<transcript>: thirty

00:27:29
<transcript>: 30 have it.

00:27:31
<transcript>: Homebrew stuff.

00:27:38
<transcript>: In them. I mean NVM Pioneers. Oh, yeah. I used to do Python development.

00:27:40
<transcript>: Cargo.

00:27:44
stroopwafel26: so /opt/homebrew/bin on M1

00:27:46
<transcript>: I don't see local yeah, I'd have to.

00:27:59
<transcript>: Is something setting my path. Like every time I started a new show, so opt Homebrew bin. Oh, Stroop would put it in what now.

00:27:59
<transcript>: what

00:28:01
<transcript>: What now.

00:28:04
<transcript>: This is VJ. Is a follower. Now.

00:28:11
<transcript>: Put it in brew prefix.

00:28:14
stroopwafel26: if you run brew --prefix you get the bin dir of homebrew

00:28:18
<transcript>: Through.

00:28:21
laytanl_: You got golang in there, my weapon of choice

00:28:24
<transcript>: Prefix. I just want to see what this is.

00:28:24
<transcript>: app foam

00:28:26
<transcript>: App Foam Broo.

00:28:26
<transcript>: you got

00:28:31
<transcript>: You got Golang in there my waypap I've written some go in my day.

00:28:31
<transcript>: i

00:28:33
<transcript>: I started a thing called three.

00:28:33
<transcript>: like

00:28:36
<transcript>: Like th.

00:28:36
<transcript>: thr

00:28:37
<transcript>: Thr.

00:28:37
<transcript>: thrd

00:28:38
<transcript>: Thrd.

00:28:44
<transcript>: That's a. I started using my Cobra and building a go.

00:28:45
<transcript>: Cli tool.

00:28:45
<transcript>: for sharing

00:29:00
<transcript>: For sharing files with your own s three buckets. I come constantly having to send big files to clients and stuff. Well, I was having to do that a lot when I was doing like I was just working on some 3D projects for clients. I wasn't doing 3D stuff, but I was working on.

00:29:00
<transcript>: they

00:29:06
<transcript>: They were doing like augmented reality or not a virtual real something. And I was building.

00:29:06
<transcript>: like

00:29:06
stroopwafel26: your $PATH has brew prefix in there 2 times :P doesn't matter though

00:29:21
<transcript>: Like machinery innate of us for Pixel streaming. If you're familiar with Pixel streaming anyway, it was like streaming these 3D environments using GPU instances on AWS. And I was having to send all these huge files. And I was like, really tired of.

00:29:21
<transcript>: email

00:29:27
<transcript>: Email and whatever I was doing, I don't even remember Dropbox or whatever and I thought it would be nice if I could just like CLI send them.

00:29:27
<transcript>: like temp

00:29:38
<transcript>: Like temporary links, backed by my S three bucket. Like it uploads it to my three bucket. And I share them that way. So it's called three, like S three. Eventually, I'll do that. I'll finish it. But anyway.

00:29:46
cowfacedude99: @stroopwafel26 the ~/.local/bin is personal choice of mine. mainly because of permission stuff

00:29:48
<transcript>: Has brew prefix in there two times. Doesn't matter, though. Okay, well, this is turned into like an expedition. We're gonna do this later.

00:29:53
<transcript>: Let's just do this. Let's work on the thing. The thing we should be working on.

00:29:58
<transcript>: So let's see, I've got it running, I've got P scale running.

00:30:03
<transcript>: Does I have to run something else? I don't think so.

00:30:07
<transcript>: I think that's it so let's open it up.

00:30:09
<transcript>: We're.

00:30:12
<transcript>: Let's see in the front end.

00:30:12
laytanl_: that's cool! I like when streamers work on actual problems they have

00:30:12
niftynate80: Most of my side projects involve S3

00:30:17
<transcript>: This thing is all nonsense. Now.

00:30:17
<transcript>: don't need that

00:30:18
<transcript>: Don't need that anymore.

00:30:22
stroopwafel26: @stroopwafel26 probably a good idea on linux machines, on macOS brew prefix is a good place

00:30:32
<transcript>: We've got new game mutations. We're learning TrpC. I'm a fan. There are some little things that I'd like to understand better. And I haven't found answers just yet, but I could find answers. I just need to take the time.

00:30:32
<transcript>: the main

00:30:39
<transcript>: The main little thing is like the type. So this the type for this thing. This response.

00:30:42
<transcript>: So cool that it's just updated in real time. I make a change on the server.

00:30:42
<transcript>: this thing is

00:31:00
<transcript>: This thing is Typed correctly, but I wish I could use those types elsewhere, so like I have a component here. I want to pass that type right now. I just made a type kind of mirrored what it is. Let me nice if I could just grab that somehow from TRPC and not have to do that. And I'm sure there's an answer.

00:31:00
<transcript>: on the next one if

00:31:03
<transcript>: On the next one. If you're still here, maybe you know the answer to that.

00:31:16
<transcript>: Oh, you love, Layton. You love when streamers work on actual problems, they have. Well, that's mostly what I do right now. So I'm I guess that's why you're here.

00:31:16
<transcript>: local bi

00:31:23
<transcript>: Local bin is personal choice of mine, mainly because of permission stuff. Yeah, I like the idea of local bin because it sits nicely into my dot files, you know.

00:31:23
<transcript>: i don't

00:31:27
<transcript>: I don't know. More files. Like I like the idea.

00:31:27
<transcript>: i'll just be able to

00:31:36
<transcript>: I'll just be able to drop, like a cuz. I'm just stowing this whole thing. I could just, like, add local bin, random scripts.

00:31:36
<transcript>: and they

00:31:46
<transcript>: And they would just get Simlin LinkedIn. I like that. I like Sound of that. I would have to add it to Path, and that's where I got hung up. But we'll add that later.

00:31:52
<transcript>: Okay. So we have this working where we can say new game. It takes forever.

00:31:52
<transcript>: there's like

00:31:55
stroopwafel26: ah yeah, forgot you use stow now

00:32:02
<transcript>: There's like a initial taking forever going on here. I'm not sure what it is. Seems like that mutation should be fast. It's just riding. Just creating a new record.

00:32:02
<transcript>: i'll

00:32:06
<transcript>: I'll look at it and we'll see why it's so slow. But anyway, once we have this.

00:32:06
<transcript>: that subsequently

00:32:14
<transcript>: That subsequently seems to be pretty fast that's not great Sage maker ground truth that's running off let's let's just fix that now actually.

00:32:14
<transcript>: i wanted

00:32:21
<transcript>: I wanted to do. I think I'll do like the AWS or Amazon part is like a little like Top Row. I'll show you.

00:32:24
<transcript>: So we'll do, like a span.

00:32:30
<transcript>: And not joking.

00:32:34
<transcript>: Right here. We're gonna put this bit.

00:32:34
<transcript>: so let's

00:32:39
<transcript>: So let's let's do this. I'm gonna do cool them thing. What was my cool vim thing to hear? I want to cut.

00:32:39
<transcript>: unlike

00:32:42
<transcript>: Unlike grab all so I want to delete.

00:32:42
<transcript>: all

00:32:46
<transcript>: All of the brackets.

00:32:52
<transcript>: Would that work? Is it a tag? I don't think so. No. Would.

00:32:56
<transcript>: Dap would be way too much. No, no, not that.

00:33:07
<transcript>: How could I do this? I could do, like, inside the bracket, but I want to do outside the bracket. So with DA, DA, DA and then bracket work.

00:33:07
<transcript>: oh

00:33:11
<transcript>: Oh, it did work. Then I just paste it in here.

00:33:11
<transcript>: like that

00:33:13
<transcript>: Like that Oh.

00:33:15
roronoarickyy: Hey Adam, which switches do you use on your keyboard ?

00:33:15
<transcript>: Like that.

00:33:15
<transcript>: cool

00:33:22
<transcript>: Cool, cool. That works. So we're gonna put it in span, because I want to, like, style. It a little differently on the top line.

00:33:25
<transcript>: Class name.

00:33:25
<transcript>: we're gonna say

00:33:26
<transcript>: We're gonna say.

00:33:29
<transcript>: Maybe I maybe need to be DIVS actually.

00:33:32
<transcript>: If it's a Div, right.

00:33:41
<transcript>: Let's rename this to a Div. How do I rename a tag? Is there a way to a quick way to do that? Anyone have any ideas.

00:33:45
cowfacedude99: @stroopwafel26 You get user level write permissions? My major issue with this on my work laptop is that every time I need to work on something I need to get admin rights.

00:33:51
adamdotdev: !keyboard

00:33:51
<transcript>: Hey, Adam, which switches to use on your keyboard. Yeah, it's a I think. Do we have the switches on the.

00:33:51
<transcript>: right here

00:33:51
fossabot: Adam uses a custom Mode Eighty mechanical keyboard, and has a collection of other Mode keyboards!

00:33:55
<transcript>: Right here. I got my Command six custom ID.

00:34:00
<transcript>: Okay. No, it doesn't say so. It's a mode 80. It's the mode.

00:34:05
<transcript>: Reflex or signal it's whatever the mode Tactile switches are.

00:34:05
<transcript>: and

00:34:11
laytanl_: nvim surround probably has that

00:34:13
reformedot: !vimrc

00:34:15
<transcript>: And they're great. I have a lot of other like name brands, which is and I don't like the sound of any of them. Like, I like this mode keyboard with its modes, which is there you go.

00:34:19
laytanl_: don't know how though

00:34:20
stroopwafel26: @stroopwafel26 everything in /opt/brew is fair play, /usr/local on intel macbooks

00:34:24
<transcript>: So I'm going to rename this tag to a Div. I can do it the dumb way, but I'd like to do.

00:34:24
<transcript>: ref

00:34:29
<transcript>: Reformed. Welcome to Chat. Also, I don't think I welcomed you.

00:34:33
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. I appreciate you guys joining us in chat.

00:34:40
<transcript>: Invite has that. Yeah, I'm thinking so late and I would change the tag, but I don't know how either.

00:34:49
<transcript>: My vimrc is in my dot files reformed. So if you just do the GitHub command, you'll get my dot file.

00:34:52
<transcript>: So maybe maybe we can figure this out.

00:34:52
<transcript>: cs

00:34:57
<transcript>: Cs is like the instance around for change.

00:35:01
reformedot: Which vim theme are u using? And which terminal?

00:35:02
<transcript>: So if I was over here, I guess inside of it and I did CS.

00:35:05
<transcript>: Cs.

00:35:05
<transcript>: csa i

00:35:09
cowfacedude99: cst might work

00:35:15
<transcript>: Csa. I don't know. I just don't know. I have not figured out how to internalize inventoround commands, so instead, I'm just gonna do this Div.

00:35:15
<transcript>: and then

00:35:17
<transcript>: And then I'm gonna go.

00:35:19
stroopwafel26: @Reformedot Dracula in Alacritty

00:35:20
<transcript>: My curve.

00:35:20
<transcript>: just do

00:35:21
cowfacedude99: I use https://github.com/windwp/nvim-ts-autotag for dealing with tags.

00:35:22
<transcript>: Just do that.

00:35:22
<transcript>: i guess

00:35:25
<transcript>: I guess I can turn on keycaster if you all.

00:35:25
<transcript>: see

00:35:27
<transcript>: See my keys as a type.

00:35:27
reformedot: Ty @stroopwafel26

00:35:28
<transcript>: That didn't work.

00:35:28
<transcript>: turn

00:35:30
<transcript>: Turn it on.

00:35:30
<transcript>: key

00:35:32
<transcript>: Keycaster.

00:35:32
<transcript>: start

00:35:36
<transcript>: Start casting. I never remember that command.

00:35:40
<transcript>: There they are lots of days. Incoming.

00:35:46
<transcript>: Okay. So we have that and I can style it a little bit different. Like I can say.

00:35:50
<transcript>: Size is gonna be a little smaller, so text.

00:35:50
<transcript>: small

00:35:55
<transcript>: Small and maybe like text Gray or something.

00:35:57
<transcript>: I guess.

00:36:03
<transcript>: I work on colors at all? Have I.

00:36:08
<transcript>: Haven't worked on colors at all.

00:36:08
<transcript>: so it's just gonna look

00:36:14
<transcript>: So it's just gonna look bad. Basically, all the colors are gonna look bad until we actually till they actually try.

00:36:18
<transcript>: Cst might work.

00:36:21
bigdiff___: keycastr is iverlapping with captions lol

00:36:23
<transcript>: Now I'm curious.

00:36:26
<transcript>: Invents auto tag for dealing with Tags. Oh.

00:36:26
<transcript>: what is this

00:36:28
<transcript>: What is this.

00:36:33
<transcript>: Cafe recommends an invent plugin. I pay attention.

00:36:45
<transcript>: Nvm TS. Auto tag use tree sitter to Autoclose and auto rename HTML type. See, I've wondered why it hasn't been autoclosing my tags. I thought I had that. I thought like the language server was just doing that or something.

00:36:45
<transcript>: and then

00:36:46
<transcript>: And then it stopped.

00:36:46
<transcript>: and

00:36:48
<transcript>: And I was sad.

00:36:54
<transcript>: I want to add this. I'm afraid if I don't do it right now, I just won't do it.

00:36:56
<transcript>: What are the commands.

00:36:56
<transcript>: usage

00:36:58
<transcript>: Usage before.

00:37:08
<transcript>: Yeah. So just auto closes the tag. But then if I do see IWS. Oh, that's Spam. So CIW.

00:37:08
<transcript>: span

00:37:10
<transcript>: Span, would read.

00:37:10
<transcript>: a div

00:37:12
<transcript>: A Div to okay Yeah.

00:37:12
<transcript>: feel

00:37:14
<transcript>: Feels good.

00:37:18
<transcript>: I'm not gonna do it right now, though I just I gotta stay focused.

00:37:25
<transcript>: Like I'm so easily just excited about stuff. I see I need to slow down, so maybe not.

00:37:25
<transcript>: gray

00:37:34
<transcript>: Gray just because I don't want to mess with colors right now, I just feel like they're all gonna be bad until I sit down and fix it.

00:37:36
cowfacedude99: let it stew.....

00:37:39
<transcript>: Merrr thanks for following Murphy Murmur feet.

00:37:39
<transcript>: keycasters

00:37:41
murrrrrphy: HeyGuys

00:37:44
<transcript>: Keycasters overlapping with Captions. Oh, I didn't think my that.

00:37:53
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat as well. Murphy. Yeah, I'll let it stew cafes. That's right. There are definitely some things that I keep trying to do, and I realize I'm lacking something.

00:38:04
<transcript>: Let's do Font Finn at the right one. Is it sin that's 100 I want light. I can never remember. Is it like, is it thin.

00:38:04
<transcript>: i feel like

00:38:07
<transcript>: I feel like that's gonna be 300.

00:38:07

00:50:56
<transcript>: Okay. So we've got what do we have here.

00:51:06
<transcript>: We've got a font. I got to load the font. I got to do all that font stuff. I always forget all the font steps. Next. Yes. Google Font selfhosted.

00:51:06
<transcript>: optimal

00:51:07
<transcript>: Optimal.

00:51:07
<transcript>: always

00:51:10
<transcript>: Always into the optimal.

00:51:25
<transcript>: I got to do optional. But what if I don't want the font to be optional? You know what if I want to be.

00:51:25
<transcript>: like

00:51:26
<transcript>: Like.

00:51:26
<transcript>: mandatory

00:51:27
<transcript>: Mandatory.

00:51:35
<transcript>: But I can't block because then it still has. I don't know. There's like still problems with that, right.

00:51:37
<transcript>: This is correct.

00:51:43
<transcript>: There's all this.

00:51:47
<transcript>: Has someone just written a nice TLDR.

00:51:59
<transcript>: This is too long. Didn't read too long.

00:52:05
<transcript>: Let's see if this person did all the nerdy stuff where you do the optimal.

00:52:05
<transcript>: okay

00:52:10
<transcript>: Okay your font file can be replaced poke fonts got it fonts CSS file place in styles.

00:52:10
<transcript>: and document

00:52:13
<transcript>: And document TSX file in pages.

00:52:16
<transcript>: Like.

00:52:16
<transcript>: this

00:52:20
<transcript>: This. Okay. I don't have a document. Psx. I will need that.

00:52:23
<transcript>: Document TSX.

00:52:28
<transcript>: So I have to put the font face in. I knew that.

00:52:39
<transcript>: Is this a good document? Is this up to date? This is 2022. So I think so.

00:52:48
<transcript>: Import Document document, contact.

00:52:56
<transcript>: That doesn't seem right.

00:52:59
<transcript>: It's a class. Wait.

<transcript>: Import everything. That's what's wrong.

00:54:17
<transcript>: So here we go. We got to custom my document. This is a thing that we can work with. We can add some, like.

00:54:26
<transcript>: Freeloading stuff here. You know what I always do whenever I want to know, like, what's the best way to do a thing? I just go to Lee, Rob's, GitHub.

00:54:33
<transcript>: Best way to do in next. Jess. Specifically. I just look at how he did his fonts. Like I'm sure he did it. I.

00:54:38
<transcript>: Using the platform with the platform is Versell.

00:54:46
<transcript>: So let's see fonts. He's got his font stuff and his Versaille JSON, which we haven't even deployed to Versaille yet. We will soon.

00:54:49

<transcript>: okay go wrong

00:55:02
<transcript>: Okay, go wrong. Blindly copying everything from Lerobs. I don't need any of these.

00:55:09
<transcript>: Why is it a lot of those redirects? I want to delete this whole.

00:55:17
<transcript>: So I want to delete all this. I'm just. What would be the good way to do that? I found delete everything inside. Well, I could do.

00:55:21
<transcript>: Just like that. That's how you do it.

00:55:25
<transcript>: Okay.

00:55:25
<transcript>: let's

00:55:30
<transcript>: Let's see. We got headers. I don't need this. I need Virgil.

00:55:31
<transcript>: Virgil.

00:55:33

<transcript>: Clean URLs. I guess we'll go with that. Sure. I'm starting to feel it. And it feels good. Feels real good. I love it.

00:55:57
<transcript>: Alright. What else does Lee Rob have here? We were really looking for font related things.

00:55:57

<transcript>: Configurity headers. We're not gonna worry about that right now, although I do want to add them eventually.

00:56:15
<transcript>: Let's see public. So he's got his font in there. Let's see styles.

00:56:15
<transcript>: this is

00:56:15
dyalicode: can u test this font to use for neovim ?

00:56:19
<transcript>: This is where we're gonna have the font face, and then this is where you can really screw it up.

00:56:23
<transcript>: We're not gonna screw it up, though.

00:56:28
<transcript>: I.

00:56:33
madlep: Should see a doc and get some ointment. "vim in your fingers" can be painful if left untreated :D

00:56:40
<transcript>: 'm with fonts. Is it's always optional? That's always the best thing is to do it as optional. I don't even know it's a font weights for this thing. Support all these font weights, Virgil we'll just find out.

00:56:40
<transcript>: font

00:56:44

00:57:23
<transcript>: and nineteen

00:57:24
<transcript>: And 19.

00:57:33
<transcript>: We're on Em. What's it called? Es modules. We're on Es modules now. I don't know. I'm making stuff up. I know nothing.

00:57:35
<transcript>: Extend.

00:57:37
<transcript>: Font family.

00:57:42
<transcript>: Who love the latest tailwind has that type ahead support now for that stuff.

00:57:42
<transcript>: sands

00:57:44
<transcript>: Sands.

00:57:46
<transcript>: And we're gonna do Virgil.

00:57:46
<transcript>: and then we're

00:57:50
<transcript>: And then we're gonna do We're gonna spread Font family.

00:57:50
<transcript>: sands

00:57:52
fijiwater_gr: I love that you show the keys so we also learn nvim

00:57:58
<transcript>: Sands. I know it doesn't exist. It's alright. We're gonna add it. It's comp. Font family.

00:58:01
<transcript>: Equals.

00:58:01
<transcript>: require

00:58:02
<transcript>: Require.

00:58:04
fijiwater_gr: what are you building ? just to sync

00:58:07
<transcript>: It's a CJS file tailwind. Cs.

00:58:07
<transcript>: csdefault

00:58:09
<transcript>: Csdefault theme.

00:58:09
<transcript>: just like that

00:58:10
cowfacedude99: I think everyone who wants to use a vim/tmux should start streaming on twitch LUL

00:58:11
<transcript>: Just like that.

00:58:11
<transcript>: not

00:58:13
<transcript>: Not just like that. What did I do wrong.

00:58:20
<transcript>: Why are they not part of import statement equals require Const something equals required.

00:58:20
<transcript>: what's wrong

00:58:22
<transcript>: What's wrong with that.

00:58:25
<transcript>: This is a CJS file. I can do that. Right.

00:58:28
cowfacedude99: @fijiwater_gr aws guessing game

00:58:30
<transcript>: Require saving that part of import statement. What do you mean.

00:58:35
<transcript>: What do you mean.

00:58:44
<transcript>: Yeah if you do water, we're building an AW guess game. Aw. Guess you guess which service based on the image.

00:58:49
<transcript>: Him in your fingers. Can be painful.

00:58:54
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:58:54
<transcript>: you may learn

00:59:02
<transcript>: You may learn some things. Fiji water. I don't know if they're all good things. You might learn some bad habits like Jang your way around the file vertically.

00:59:13
<transcript>: I think everyone who wants to use the Mucks or Vim and TMUK should start streaming on Twitch. I think that's excellent device Cafe. I've learned so much faster by having you all here.

00:59:20
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow Div mode. I appreciate that. Follow. Do I just need the LSB restart or something? I don't know. Why is this.

00:59:20
<transcript>: esl

00:59:24
<transcript>: Eslant bothering me and I feel like it should not.

00:59:24
<transcript>: like i should

00:59:29
<transcript>: Like I shouldn't even be is linting. This file is what I feel like.

00:59:31
divmode: Hello

00:59:31
<transcript>: Let's just disable.

00:59:33
<transcript>: This line, I guess.

00:59:38
<transcript>: Just for that. I'm sure.

00:59:43
<transcript>: But I probably shouldn't even use Lend this file. It's a common JS file after all.

00:59:46
<transcript>: Okay.

00:59:49
<transcript>: I guess that's just being explicit. Like.

00:59:55
<transcript>: That's a good call out from the from the T three folks.

00:59:55
<transcript>: like if

01:00:01
<transcript>: Like if it's a JS file explicitly state that it's common JS versus an ESM module or something.

01:00:01
<transcript>: load of

01:00:08
<transcript>: Load of mode welcome to chat welcome, welcome thanks for the follow. Welcome to chat both things I love.

01:00:12
<transcript>: Okay, we added. Virgil is a font family.

01:00:12
<transcript>: so let's

01:00:18
<transcript>: So let's go. Let's look at Where's the other thing, the custom document. That's gonna be another thing he did.

01:00:18
<transcript>: he

01:00:24
<transcript>: He probably has a custom document, just like that. Sure does. And this is where we're gonna preload.

01:00:26
cowfacedude99: @fijiwater_gr watch prime if you want to go full vim LUL . sorry for #ad @adamdotdev

01:00:27
<transcript>: And preload it.

01:00:30
<transcript>: Let's just see if I've documented still open here.

01:00:30
<transcript>: there

01:00:34
<transcript>: There it is so render in the head.

01:00:37
<transcript>: So here.

01:00:43
<transcript>: We're gonna do like this.

01:00:46
<transcript>: Nope.

01:00:51
<transcript>: We're going to copy this thing.

01:00:53
<transcript>: And paste it.

01:00:53
<transcript>: out

01:00:56
<transcript>: Out see, this needs to be.

01:00:58
<transcript>: Virgil.

01:01:02
<transcript>: Everything else looks good.

01:01:07
<transcript>: What else? I don't need all this stuff yet. We don't have a custom favicon.

01:01:11
<transcript>: Save icon favicon anyone know.

01:01:11
<transcript>: i think that's

01:01:14
<transcript>: I think that's it I think our Font show should now be.

01:01:14
<transcript>: the font

01:01:15
<transcript>: The font.

01:01:15
<transcript>: the

01:01:20
<transcript>: The Xcallidra font. Ooh, we broke it. Oh, look at that.

01:01:25
<transcript>: The colors are still awful. Let's go on. Just fix the colors. What do you say.

01:01:25
<transcript>: let's just fix them

01:01:28
<transcript>: Let's just fix them. So we're gonna make the body.

01:01:30
<transcript>: Class name.

01:01:30
<transcript>: mac

01:01:32
<transcript>: Macro.

01:01:35
justjustalex: definitely supposed to be fave-icon but that feels like too much work to say

01:01:37
<transcript>: Navy. Is there a Navy Blue 800 or something.

01:01:42
<transcript>: That's not dark enough. Let's do this. Let's Radics.

01:01:42
<transcript>: radics

01:01:47
<transcript>: Radics colors. We're gonna use Racks Color system because they.

01:01:47
<transcript>: 're

01:01:48
<transcript>: 're.

01:01:48
<transcript>: so good

01:01:49
<transcript>: So good.

01:01:54
<transcript>: Now, no, no, don't never apologize for.

01:01:54
<transcript>: advertising

01:01:58
<transcript>: Advertising Prime Stream Prime When Prime Goes Live generally.

01:01:58
<transcript>: i

01:02:01
<transcript>: I in my stream because I want to watch.

01:02:11
<transcript>: I don't really stream at the same time. It's primed, so no worries with advertising. You can advertise anybody you want. Who's on right now? People that you could probably go watch.

01:02:18
<transcript>: I just love the idea of people streaming Dev on Twitter. I just think it's fantastic. I think it's so much better.

01:02:18
<transcript>: for like

01:02:26
neochromer: Hi hi

01:02:32
<transcript>: For like junior developers and spend their time listening in on Twitch rather than reading thought leadership on Twitter. I'm a huge advocate, so I just want more people coming in and watching developers stream on Twitch doesn't have to be me.

01:02:32
<transcript>: i love

01:02:34
fijiwater_gr: dev twitch is hugeeeee love the community and seeing it grow actually :D

01:02:36
<transcript>: I love having friends here, but we've got friends. We've got people here hanging out.

01:02:36
<transcript>: yeah

01:02:38
cowfacedude99: I tend to also watch krisnova too.

01:02:49
cowfacedude99: around this time

01:02:54
<transcript>: Yeah, spread the spread the love around all the good there's so many devs, so many good ones streaming on Twitch. Definitely supposed to be Save icon, but what that feels like too much work to say. I agree. Favicon it is. Thank you so much for the follows. Shrimp and Barney of The Rebel. Welcome.

01:02:54
<transcript>: welcome welcome welcome welcome

01:02:55
schriis: Exactly why I'm here :D

<transcript>: oh

01:03:04
<transcript>: Oh, I don't have Chris Nova? Oh, Chris Nova? Here we go.

01:03:04
<transcript>: i think

01:03:07
<transcript>: I think I saw Christmas on Twitter yesterday.

01:03:07
<transcript>: so is it

01:03:09
neochromer: there are a lot of technologies I would never hear about if it wasn't for Twitch streamers

01:03:12
<transcript>: So is it weird while I'm streaming to follow someone, I'm gonna follow Chris Nova while I'm streaming her right now.

01:03:12
<transcript>: i just did it

01:03:14
<transcript>: I just did it.

01:03:17
divmode: That’s me, also love the t3 stack and radix

01:03:17
madlep: I would watch prime live, but he's on after my bed time here

01:03:22
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah. No, I saw. I want her to be in the pool of people we might raid randomly at the end of my stream. If.

01:03:22
<transcript>: she's still

01:03:23
<transcript>: She's still streaming.

01:03:27
<transcript>: Exactly why you're here. Stress. That's good to hear.

01:03:36
<transcript>: A lot of technologies I would never hear about if it wasn't for Twitch Streamers. That's me also love the T Three stack and Radics reddicts.

01:03:38
<transcript>: Cool Div.

01:03:40
<transcript>: dive

01:03:40
<transcript>: dive is on

01:03:50
<transcript>: Dive is on after your bedtime. Yeah, it's I go back and watch Primes stuff because I don't really. I'm not at my computer when he streams. I in my day really early. Probably about the same time you all do.

01:03:55
<transcript>: You all being.

01:03:55
<transcript>: people

01:04:03
<transcript>: People not in the US generally feel like I'm mostly hanging out with people that don't hang out in the US or don't live in the us.

01:04:13
<transcript>: Okay, so we went, like a Navy blue. There's blue, Indigo, Violet. I'm just trying to get kind of like, AWS colors. Here we go.

01:04:19
<transcript>: It's actually a bright color. So I guess just the blue, but dark enough.

01:04:19
<transcript>: okay

01:04:22
<transcript>: Okay, hear me out. We're gonna take blue.

01:04:22
<transcript>: first

01:04:31
<transcript>: First, you have to choose a Gray color, right? So we're gonna use our Gray color is going to be the one that goes well with Blues, which is slate.

01:04:31
<transcript>: i love the

01:04:34
barneyoftherubble: Aren’t all the “people” in the US robots?

01:04:35
<transcript>: I love the Radiix color system. So much. So let's do this.

01:04:37
<transcript>: Let's.

01:04:37
<transcript>: open tailwind

01:04:38
<transcript>: Open tailwind.

01:04:38
<transcript>: config

01:04:43
<transcript>: Config, and we're gonna extend the colors.

01:04:43
<transcript>: colors

01:04:44
<transcript>: Colors.

01:04:50
<transcript>: Like this.

01:04:58
<transcript>: I want to go back to Lerob here. I think it is extended colors. I just don't know the syntax.

01:05:01
<transcript>: The C. Spread.

01:05:01
<transcript>: let's see

01:05:03
<transcript>: Let's see tail end.

01:05:12
<transcript>: Colors. So we're not doing any, like spreading the default theme colors or anything. We're just adding new colors.

01:05:12
<transcript>: so

01:05:19
<transcript>: So I think I'm gonna do like you did? I'm just gonna override grey with my own Gray? I'm gonna override blue with my own blue.

01:05:19
<transcript>: that kind of

01:05:22
<transcript>: That kind of thing. So we're gonna have colors.

01:05:24
<transcript>: Gray.

01:05:28
<transcript>: Let's.

01:05:31
<transcript>: Copy the slate.

01:05:39
<transcript>: Gray. And we'll do. Don't do the alphas. I definitely would do darts. Don't do the Alphas or the regular.

01:05:43
<transcript>: Must do Alphas.

01:05:43
<transcript>: copy

01:05:45
<transcript>: Copy as object.

01:05:45
<transcript>: hex

01:05:47
<transcript>: Hex Yes.

01:05:49
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:05:49
<transcript>: paste that

01:05:52
<transcript>: Paste that thing. Now we're gonna.

01:05:52
<transcript>: copy

01:05:53
<transcript>: Copy.

01:05:53
<transcript>: let's see

01:05:54
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:05:58
<transcript>: I do this a cool way. I could yank.

01:05:58
<transcript>: all

01:06:00
<transcript>: All right.

01:06:04
<transcript>: Let's do Yank, yank.

01:06:04
<transcript>: to the

01:06:08
<transcript>: To the closed bracket. How would I want to do that? I can do yank.

01:06:08
<transcript>: thirteen

01:06:10
<transcript>: 13 J.

01:06:10
<transcript>: fun

01:06:16
mhuggins7278: yi}

01:06:19
<transcript>: Fun way. But there's probably better ways. How would I yank Yank outside the Brown? Just like that. That feels good. I like that feeling. And then.

01:06:22
<transcript>: Like this.

01:06:24
<transcript>: Right.

01:06:27
<transcript>: Okay, that works.

01:06:29
<transcript>: Let's.

01:06:29
<transcript>: delete that

01:06:35
<transcript>: Delete that paragraph. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So here's our slate. Oh, I need to remove all these prefixes.

01:06:35
<transcript>: it should just

01:06:39
<transcript>: It should just be wait, wait, wait, wait. These should all be like numbers. Right.

01:06:41
<transcript>: Gray.

01:06:49
<transcript>: Why not do the I don't know if I want to do the 100, 200, 300, 400 like that's. How tailwind does it? I think I want to do like.

01:06:54
<transcript>: A one. A one through twelve.

01:06:54
<transcript>: so

01:06:55
<transcript>: So.

01:06:55
<transcript>: how would i

01:06:58
<transcript>: How would I want to do that? I would do.

01:07:04
<transcript>: But just do like a one.

01:07:04
<transcript>: that can work

01:07:06
<transcript>: That can work.

01:07:06
mhuggins7278: dtA

01:07:16
<transcript>: All these. So I kind of increment that I don't know.

01:07:18
<transcript>: How do you control a.

01:07:18
<transcript>: what was it

01:07:23
<transcript>: What was it? Incrementing numbers. There's a cool way to like, increment a number.

01:07:25
<transcript>: Yeah, that's down.

01:07:25
<transcript>: there you go

01:07:27
<transcript>: There you go, up.

01:07:31
<transcript>: I'm down with that.

01:07:35
<transcript>: I go up. No.

01:07:38
<transcript>: I guess I could just do this.

01:07:45
<transcript>: Someone could tell me how to increment numbers. I want to remember that one. That's a cool one.

01:07:49
<transcript>: Again? Yeah? Learning.

01:07:52
<transcript>: New, then on Twitch.

01:07:52
<transcript>: is the best

01:07:53
<transcript>: Is the best.

01:07:57
neochromer: CTRL A increment?

01:07:59
neochromer: maybe?

01:08:01
mhuggins7278: ctrl-a

01:08:01
<transcript>: I don't want to take advantage of it. I hope you don't feel taking advantage of calf. A particular.

01:08:02
neochromer: don't remember

01:08:04
<transcript>: Control. A. Is increment.

01:08:04
<transcript>: control

01:08:08
mhuggins7278: ctrl-x decrement

01:08:08
<transcript>: Control. A. Yeah. I thought I was doing that. It wasn't working. I wonder if it doesn't work.

01:08:11
<transcript>: There it goes.

01:08:11
<transcript>: i

01:08:13
<transcript>: I haven't made it twice.

01:08:13
<transcript>: which is strange

01:08:15
<transcript>: Which is strange to me.

01:08:15
<transcript>: anyway

01:08:16
<transcript>: Anyway.

01:08:16
<transcript>: hey one

01:08:21
urobeat: because of tmux prefix

01:08:22
<transcript>: Hey, one through a twelve. Actually, let's ditch the A's.

01:08:22
neochromer: CTRL X decrement

01:08:25
<transcript>: I do this.

01:08:30
<transcript>: One through twelve. Now, if I did that right.

01:08:33
<transcript>: Then if we go back to our index.

01:08:36
<transcript>: Here. I should be able to set.

01:08:47
<transcript>: New game so like after let's see Border, border Orange we're gonna do.

01:08:51
<transcript>: Take our text to Gray, I guess.

01:08:52
<transcript>: Text.

01:08:54
<transcript>: Gray. One.

01:09:06
<transcript>: I'm having hit it twice. So weird.

01:09:10
<transcript>: Here we go. That's where.

01:09:11
afsardo: text-gray-3

01:09:15
<transcript>: I guess it would be like eleven.

01:09:15
<transcript>: oh

01:09:17
<transcript>: Oh.

01:09:24
<transcript>: Eleven would be your normal like font color, right? Is that right, Reddit. So let's see.

01:09:24
<transcript>: slate

01:09:25
<transcript>: Slate.

01:09:29
<transcript>: No, this is the dark scale. So it'd be.

01:09:34
<transcript>: Two, two would be your normal font. One would be your emphasis font.

01:09:36
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:09:51
<transcript>: Okay, so there's that. And then if I did, like two, it goes a little softer that's way. Softer, though. Text grade two. I think you so much, Ian, for the subscription. Wow. Thank you so much. I really appreciate that.

01:09:51
<transcript>: that reminding

01:10:06
iann0036: <3

01:10:07
<transcript>: That reminding today we're gonna be donating my first Twitch payout. I got my first Twitch payout. Been doing this couple months, and we finally we cracked the $100 threshold. We have a payout. We're gonna donate that to a charitable organization. I've got a couple of suggestions that I'm gonna put it up for, like.

01:10:07
<transcript>: actually

01:10:14
<transcript>: Actually just any time during the stream we'll do it at the end if at any time there's a charitable organization that you.

01:10:14
<transcript>: are

01:10:18
<transcript>: Are passionate about that in particular.

01:10:18
<transcript>: benefits

01:10:21
<transcript>: Benefits Those in tech.

01:10:21
<transcript>: diversity

01:10:33
<transcript>: Diversity intext. So I want to like, try my hardest to reflect any attention I get on the Internet towards people who've had a harder time in this career in Tech because I've had a pretty easy time.

01:10:42
<transcript>: That's what I'm really looking for. So charitable organizations that benefit sort of encouraged diversity and integr. So there's some women who code.

01:10:46
<transcript>: There's all kinds of these organizations that.

01:10:46
barneyoftherubble: Can you buy Microsoft?

01:11:00
<transcript>: Promote diversity in tech. That's what I'm looking for. If you have charitable organizations you're interested in that you are passionate about that you've maybe been involved with in some way. Please recommend them in Twitch Chat. We'll do a poll at the end and pick one and donate proceeds. Can you buy Microsoft.

01:11:02
<transcript>: No.

01:11:02
<transcript>: what do you mean

01:11:04
<transcript>: What do you mean.

01:11:04
<transcript>: do i

01:11:06
<transcript>: Do I have my bad hair down right now.

01:11:06
<transcript>: i do

01:11:11
<transcript>: I do this very minute. I have my bad hair day on.

01:11:15
<transcript>: So I just said some serious things. Some things.

01:11:15
<transcript>: that i

01:11:24
<transcript>: That I care about and I looked like this. This is what it looked like. Someone could have told me maybe that I had my bad hair on and I could see that speech.

01:11:24
afsardo: I waited a bit, no.

01:11:29
<transcript>: Anyway, we're gonna do that the end of the stream. So again, organizations that you're aware of.

01:11:29
<transcript>: that prom

01:11:33
<transcript>: That promote diversity in tech. Please do share them.

01:11:33
<transcript>: and we will

01:11:33
justjustalex: they hit you with the bad hair mid-speech

01:11:37
<transcript>: And we will pick one at the end and donate. I think it's just like $300.

01:11:37
<transcript>: but

01:11:47
<transcript>: But we're gonna donate it, and as long as people keep showing up and subscribing, maybe that number will grow and maybe we'll donate more next month, or whenever you get paths I don't even know.

01:11:52
<transcript>: They hit me with the bad hair day. Midsfeature like this is getting too serious. Little too heavy.

01:11:52
<transcript>: for my taste

01:11:53
afsardo: I found funny cause you said "I had pretty easy"

01:11:55
<transcript>: For my taste. Here's some bad hair.

01:12:01
<transcript>: Sound. It funny because you said I had it pretty easy. Yeah. No, I did. I mean, I.

01:12:01
<transcript>: had

01:12:10
<transcript>: Had a pretty easy time 15 years ago. Getting hired is a white guy in tech and I know that's not been everybody's experience and.

01:12:10
<transcript>: i'll just leave it at that

01:12:12
madlep: donate to Center for Devs Who Can't Vim Good and Who Wanna Learn to Do Other Tech Stuff Good Too

01:12:12
<transcript>: I'll just leave it at that for now.

01:12:15
<transcript>: So why is text Gray.

01:12:15
<transcript>: look like

01:12:17
afsardo: I'm joking, thats why I wanted to give you the bad hair.

01:12:19
<transcript>: Look like that? What is textgray? Three. Look like.

01:12:22
<transcript>: Nothing. I think those aren't actually.

01:12:24
<transcript>: Those aren't actually.

01:12:24
<transcript>: yeah they are

01:12:26
<transcript>: Yeah, they are.

01:12:28
<transcript>: What.

01:12:31
<transcript>: Shouldn't be getting darker.

01:12:38
<transcript>: It's not doing anything. Okay. So maybe I need to reload.

01:12:40
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:12:40
<transcript>: control

01:12:42
<transcript>: Control. A two.

01:12:44
<transcript>: Controller.

01:12:45
waldirborbajr: wow, 10 seconds of delay kkkk

01:12:49
<transcript>: Let's try reloading the Dev server.

01:12:54
<transcript>: I don't know if you have to do that when you make tailwind config changes. I don't think so.

01:12:59
<transcript>: Just. Just. Alex. Thanks so much for the follow.

01:13:03
madlep: or donate to Search and Rescue For Devs Trapped in Vim And Can't Exit

01:13:06
<transcript>: Let's see if any donate to center for Devs who can't vim good want to learn to do other tech stuff? Good do.

01:13:06
<transcript>: that's funny

01:13:08
<transcript>: That's funny.

01:13:08
<transcript>: oh that's why i

01:13:18
afsardo: I'm not from the US and I don't wanna get too much into politics but I dont think it's being white that matters, but your social economic background which it's true being White there is a higher chance that you came from a way better background.

01:13:19
<transcript>: Oh, that's why I wanted to get the better I got you. I got you, Ash. Sardo. That's hard for me to say ass. I'll call you Sardo. I got you as Sardo or no.

01:13:19
<transcript>: f sardo

01:13:22
<transcript>: F Sardo? Sorry. Adjust. That just said I was gonna call you Sardo.

01:13:22
<transcript>: ten seconds

01:13:26
afsardo: Yeah I'm André Sardo ^^

01:13:26
<transcript>: 10 seconds of delay? What's the 10 seconds of delay? Wild ear.

01:13:26
<transcript>: what is it

01:13:29
<transcript>: What is it? What is 10 seconds delay.

01:13:29
<transcript>: search

01:13:33
<transcript>: Searchandrescue for devs trapped in vim and cache.

01:13:33
<transcript>: not from

01:13:45
<transcript>: Not from the US. I'm not only get too much into politics, but I don't think it's being white that matters, but your social economic background, which is trubing white. Yeah. No. That's why I don't really want to dig too deep into it because it's so complex. The world is very complex.

01:13:45
<transcript>: and

01:13:50
<transcript>: And the reality is there's a lot of people like me that look like me.

01:13:50
<transcript>: in

01:13:54
<transcript>: In the positions we're in because of a lot of.

01:13:54
<transcript>: institutional

01:13:55
afsardo: Gender is the biggest one.

01:14:07
afsardo: Yeah historic reasons yeah.

01:14:07
<transcript>: Institutional and, like decadeslong, things that have set us up to be in a socioeconomic class. That made it easy to do what we do. Like, I get it's so complex. It's not just because I'm white. It's because.

01:14:07
<transcript>: the world

01:14:15
<transcript>: The world works a certain way. And there is a history here in the US that sort of like set up white people to succeed.

01:14:15
<transcript>: and

01:14:23
<transcript>: And it's not because of our skin color. Now maybe I really don't want to dig too deep into this because I know it's complex. And I don't want to say people.

01:14:43
<transcript>: Ultimately, I just want to make sure I'm helping people who don't have it so easy. And that might be people in poverty, that might be people who haven't gotten a chance because of something else about themselves that they shouldn't have ever been discriminated against. That's what these organizations promote. They promote.

01:14:43
<transcript>: inclusivity

01:14:47
afsardo: Equal opportunities yeah, I've been giving coding lessons to people who can't go to college.

01:14:55
<transcript>: Inclusivity. In tech and promoting diversity. That's what I want to do. I want to back those organizations to the best of my ability. And if that's donating a little bit of Twitter money that I receive, there you go.

01:14:55
<transcript>: i'm gonna stop now

01:14:57
<transcript>: I'm gonna stop now.

01:14:59
neochromer: location, status, your friends.. everything plays a role

01:15:03
madlep: Well said Elton

01:15:10
<transcript>: Historic reasons. Yeah, I'm just hand waving ginger is the I mean, it bothers me, and there's a lot of fantastic women streamers on Twitch, but it is amazing how many of my coworkers, how many of my.

01:15:13
<transcript>: People within my social sphere in tech.

01:15:13
<transcript>: through fifteen

01:15:20
waldirborbajr: it is showing a time that you are online on your screen, and the time that appear here ate twitch has a clock too. the delay between your screen and twitch screen here exactly 10 seconds

01:15:24
<transcript>: Through 15 years of my career have been men. And there's a lot of reasons for that. In computer science. At Missouri State, I went for, like, three semesters, and then I failed out. But when I was at College.

01:15:24
<transcript>: univers

01:15:29
<transcript>: University. Over there in Europe. What you would call University, I guess in College.

01:15:29
<transcript>: the hide

01:15:45
<transcript>: The hide courses in the computer science degree track, like physics courses and math courses where there were no women in, like, 50 students. And it was all men. And that bothersome. So I know that there's a lot of organizations helping to promote stem.

01:15:45
<transcript>: with

01:15:53
stroopwafel26: 5 seconds here, maybe refresh your tab

01:15:55
afsardo: I had 3 femele colleagues, but as years passed the ratio was improving a lot so future is bright ^^(as long as it's their choice ofc).

01:16:03
<transcript>: With girls coming up in school and like, getting them into science and technology, I know it's not near the problem. It was 20 years ago. And that's the point. That's why I want to help these organizations who are helping to make that better. Okay. I'm gonna stop now. I keep maybe refresh your tab. Oh, okay.

01:16:03
<transcript>: i keep saying

01:16:12
<transcript>: I keep saying I'm gonna stop, and I keep saying things. The reason I don't want to say a lot of things is that I know I don't have the answers. And I know very little I'm an osarkian.

01:16:14
<transcript>: Middle aged man.

01:16:14
<transcript>: who

01:16:30
neochromer: @adamdotdev When I studied 2011-ish there were 3 girls and 100+ man.. now its kinda opposite, they have over 100+ girls

01:16:30
<transcript>: Who's a programmer who happens to be streaming here with some friends and I know very little, so don't listen to me, but I do know that I don't need money from Twitch to keep streaming. I want to keep streaming because it's fun. And if I can take that money and use it for any kind of good.

01:16:30
<transcript>: and maybe

01:16:36
stroopwafel26: middle-aged men who yells at gen z to get off his lawn

01:16:38
neochromer: who would expect that from Bosnia

01:16:46
<transcript>: And maybe open up somebody else to the idea of promoting diversity intact because they saw that we donated that money to this organization. Maybe they read 10 seconds about their organization. That seems like a little bit of positivity in the world that I'm here for. There you go. I'm done now. I'm really done.

01:16:46
<transcript>: we're gonna build

01:16:49
<transcript>: We're gonna build this stupid AW, guest game. I'm here to.

01:16:49
<transcript>: inv

01:16:55
<transcript>: Inv all that stuff. I'm done talking about it. But that's just what we're gonna do. So there you go.

01:16:56
afsardo: Really? Portugal that's not the case yet but it's like 30/70.

01:17:03
<transcript>: Alright.

01:17:05
<transcript>: Showing.

01:17:05
<transcript>: a time

01:17:07
<transcript>: A time when you're online on screen.

01:17:07
<transcript>: and the time that

01:17:09
<transcript>: And the time that appear here.

01:17:09
<transcript>: twitch

01:17:15
<transcript>: Twitch has a Clark. Two is the late between your screen and Twitch screen. Here. Exactly 10 seconds. You're telling me you have to wait 10 seconds.

01:17:25
<transcript>: To get all this. So you're hearing me 10 seconds in the past. That's crazy. Thanks so much. A liptom ellipticum for the follow. I really appreciate it.

01:17:29
neochromer: yeah

01:17:31
afsardo: It's like being close to a black hole xD

01:17:32
<transcript>: 5 seconds here. Oh, you were telling him to refresh him? I gotcha.

01:17:34
afsardo: Time slows down.

01:17:40
neochromer: I also got bamboozled when I saw the graduation photos

01:17:41
<transcript>: 's yours pass ratio is improving a lot, so future is bright. I do think there are things improving it's also, I gotta stop, I gotta stop.

01:17:43
laytanl_: I have never had a woman coworker in a dev role. Most product owners are woman here though

01:17:51
<transcript>: I do yellow ginsee a lot. I still haven't gotten that out of my system. I'm very ageist.

01:17:56
<transcript>: Okay. I'm just reading. I'm trying to.

01:18:02
<transcript>: Okay.

01:18:13
<transcript>: Back here, we're trying to figure out why do my tailwind colors not work? I restarted my thing, I refresh the browser, and I don't think that was ever gonna fix it, but that's what we tried.

01:18:13
<transcript>: text

01:18:17
<transcript>: Text. Grade seven. What's? Actually inspect? We can do this. We can inspect.

01:18:17
<transcript>: the text

01:18:19
<transcript>: The text, color.

01:18:24
<transcript>: Computed.

01:18:26
<transcript>: And we're looking for.

01:18:29
<transcript>: Color is that.

01:18:29
afsardo: Styles.

01:18:32
<transcript>: And I want to see it in Hex.

01:18:35
<transcript>: Oh, text, Gray, eight.

01:18:35
<transcript>: right

01:18:36
<transcript>: Right.

01:18:45
<transcript>: So so I can figure out what's going on here.

01:18:50
<transcript>: Color the way to do that right.

01:18:53
<transcript>: Alt.

01:18:55
<transcript>: No.

01:18:59
<transcript>: noodle

01:18:59
<transcript>: noodle how do i do that how do i

01:19:02
<transcript>: Noodle. How do I do that? How do I change that to display.

01:19:03
afsardo: Tailwind has that opacity so you can add text-opacity

01:19:12
<transcript>: I can do that. Oh, well, maybe it's that if I click on now.

01:19:15
afsardo: You can on the styles tab.

01:19:20
<transcript>: Color? Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. If I do this.

01:19:23
<transcript>: Nana.

01:19:31
pannosa: Click on the rectangle with the color

01:19:31
<transcript>: You can on the style tab. Oh, that's what it is. So if I'm looking at this, I can change this to arge to not be RGB.

01:19:36
<transcript>: How do I do that.

01:19:39
<transcript>: Copy, now.

01:19:40
afsardo: Swap the opacity to 1

01:19:43
<transcript>: Click on the rectangle with the color.

01:19:45
pannosa: Then you'll get a color picker

01:19:48
<transcript>: Is it because it's like a very variable that I can't see the rectangle. Now.

01:19:50
afsardo: Yeah

01:19:52
<transcript>: Do get a color swap the opacity to one.

01:19:57
pannosa: under computed

01:20:03
afsardo: Just remove that --tw

01:20:11
<transcript>: Under computed. You're saying click on this rectangle? Yeah, I was clicking on that little rectangle. I thought that was the trick too, but it was.

01:20:11
<transcript>: open

01:20:14
waldirborbajr: after refreshing my tab now it is  17 seconds delay kkkk

01:20:15
<transcript>: Opening a color picker. If it is, it's not on a screen. I can see.

01:20:15
<transcript>: it

01:20:17
<transcript>: It.

01:20:27
<transcript>: 17 seconds to lay wall deer goodness.

01:20:29
<transcript>: So you wrote that.

01:20:29
<transcript>: along

01:20:32
<transcript>: Along time ago no.

01:20:32
<transcript>: you just wrote that

01:20:43
<transcript>: You just wrote that, but you're gonna hear me saying this in 17 seconds. That's intense. Oh, did we get the transcoding today? I really need to be a partner so that I know you guys can transcode.

01:20:43
<transcript>: my video

01:20:48
<transcript>: My video, or I'm just gonna start streaming in 720p. So that's what I got to do.

01:20:50
<transcript>: Quality.

01:20:50
<transcript>: oh looks

01:20:51
shn4ke: yeah

01:20:51
stroopwafel26: transcoding is a go

01:20:52
<transcript>: Oh, looks like I have transcoding today.

01:20:52
<transcript>: maybe

01:20:54
<transcript>: Maybe try watching in.

01:20:54
<transcript>: a lower

01:20:56
<transcript>: A lower quality.

01:20:56
<transcript>: or

01:21:02
<transcript>: Or maybe. Okay, let's just look at our tailwind file. Maybe I can just figure this out without.

01:21:02
<transcript>: for these

01:21:04
<transcript>: For these right.

01:21:09
<transcript>: What was it? Text, Gray, seven.

01:21:15
<transcript>: X Gray? Seven? So I spoke Grey wrong? No. Ay, yeah, Yeah.

01:21:15
<transcript>: text gra

01:21:17
<transcript>: Text, Gray, seven.

01:21:23
<transcript>: Is E. F. Okay, let's just do this. Let's.

01:21:26
<transcript>: Yank inside the quotes.

01:21:29
<transcript>: And then let's go back here and say text.

01:21:33
<transcript>: Like this.

01:21:33
<transcript>: nope

01:21:34
<transcript>: Nope.

01:21:36
shn4ke: gn adam and chat katfirSleep it's almost 5 am

01:21:37
<transcript>: Like we're typing it.

01:21:39
<transcript>: I didn't yank it right.

01:21:43
<transcript>: I yanked this Yank in quotes.

01:21:43
<transcript>: why didn't that work

01:21:44
<transcript>: Why didn't that work.

01:21:47
<transcript>: Yank word.

01:21:47
<transcript>: for that

01:21:48
<transcript>: For that.

01:21:49
mhuggins7278: you need the "

01:21:52
<transcript>: Think word.

01:21:56
<transcript>: Paste. There we go.

01:21:59
<transcript>: You see that it blinks.

01:22:01
<transcript>: Under blink for.

01:22:01
<transcript>: now let's see

01:22:04
<transcript>: Now let's see if this if I can actually figure out the color thing.

01:22:04
<transcript>: by inspecting it

01:22:06
<transcript>: By inspecting it.

01:22:06
mhuggins7278: you used  a single quote not a double

01:22:10
<transcript>: Inspect computed color.

01:22:18
<transcript>: Style.

01:22:20
<transcript>: Text.

01:22:20
<transcript>: so that's

01:22:22
<transcript>: So that's the color.

01:22:30
<transcript>: Does it just look wrong on white? Is that all? No, this shouldn't look wrong on white.

01:22:33
<transcript>: Wait.

01:22:33
<transcript>: it might

01:22:38
<transcript>: It might. That might be the problem here. I think the problem is I'm getting ahead of myself.

01:22:39
afsardo: try on black

01:22:45
<transcript>: Getting ahead of myself. These are meant to be a dark mode color scheme, so one is black.

01:22:45
<transcript>: up

01:23:06
<transcript>: Up to these light colors that use for text on a dark background. We don't have a dark background right now. We have a light background. Let's fix all of it. So that's our Gray scale. We're good. We're gonna move on to let's get a blue scale, and we'll get an Orange scale. Here we go. So blue, dark Alpha. Oh, these are Alpha. These are Alpha colors.

01:23:07
<transcript>: Aha.

01:23:07
<transcript>: that's

01:23:11
<transcript>: That's the problem. Let's not do the Alpha scale. Let's do.

01:23:11
<transcript>: slate

01:23:13
<transcript>: Slate. Dark.

01:23:13
<transcript>: cop

01:23:18
<transcript>: Copies object I got all distracted when I started going off on my.

01:23:28
<transcript>: I don't know what I'm talking about. Speech.

01:23:32
<transcript>: Paste it there.

01:23:35
<transcript>: So then we're gonna delete.

01:23:40
afsardo: what's the difference alpha scale?

01:23:46
<transcript>: This stuff, and then we're gonna rename all these to be. Well, we're just gonna remove slate from all of it, right.

01:23:46
<transcript>: so

01:23:47
<transcript>: So like this.

01:23:47
<transcript>: slate

01:23:48
afsardo: Is it meant to be used with some sort of opacity?

01:23:49
<transcript>: Slate.

01:23:58
<transcript>: Cool. Okay, so there's our Gray scale. It's no longer an Alpha scale. So we should actually see that reflective here.

01:24:01
<transcript>: If I go back.

01:24:07
<transcript>: We'll do the proper colors would be like.

01:24:08
laytanl_: Have you used the Arc(browser company) browser yet?

01:24:09
<transcript>: X Gray.

01:24:09
<transcript>: zero

01:24:11
<transcript>: Zero would be.

01:24:11
<transcript>: yeah and then

01:24:13
<transcript>: Yeah. And then.

01:24:13
<transcript>: emphasis

01:24:13
laytanl_: I just got my invite

01:24:14
<transcript>: Emphasis.

01:24:18
<transcript>: Or Deemphasize would be that one.

01:24:18
<transcript>: six grade

01:24:20
<transcript>: Six. Grade One. Right.

01:24:24
<transcript>: Oh, that's why control A is not worth.

01:24:28
<transcript>: Tmux it's my leader for TeamX.

01:24:34
pannosa: Under "computed" you can shift +  click the color value, then you can switch between the color formats (ex. hex).

01:24:36
<transcript>: Was that not working.

01:24:46
<transcript>: It's just hard to tell on the white background, I guess.

01:24:52
<transcript>: Like that looks black.

01:24:54
<transcript>: That looks very black.

01:25:00
<transcript>: Okay, let's just keep going. Let's get our blue scale.

01:25:04
<transcript>: Let's make some actual chain. Let's make some progress here.

01:25:05
<transcript>: I'm just treading water.

01:25:11
<transcript>: Blue. That's a nice Navy. We're doing blue. Dark, not Alpha.

01:25:11
<transcript>: cop

01:25:13
<transcript>: Copy as Hex.

01:25:15
<transcript>: Okay.

01:25:21
<transcript>: We're gonna do.

01:25:30
<transcript>: Mode I want yank yank a bracket.

01:25:33
<transcript>: And then we're gonna add.

01:25:35
<transcript>: Blue.

01:25:42
<transcript>: And then we're gonna remove all these Blues.

01:25:45
<transcript>: I'm gonna do that.

01:25:45
<transcript>: let's just do this

01:25:46
<transcript>: Let's just do this.

01:25:50
<transcript>: Let's do delete.

01:25:54
<transcript>: Delete three.

01:25:58
<transcript>: Like if I do delete.

01:25:58
<transcript>: three l

01:25:59
<transcript>: Three, L.

01:25:59
<transcript>: not four

01:26:03
<transcript>: Not four, delete, four L, and then I can just.

01:26:03
<transcript>: period

01:26:04
<transcript>: Period.

01:26:07
<transcript>: Hit? Yeah, I felt good.

01:26:07
<transcript>: okay

01:26:10
<transcript>: Okay. Thank you for the follow.

01:26:10
<transcript>: allr

01:26:13
<transcript>: Allr aller it's hard to say.

01:26:15
stroopwafel26: this guy vims

01:26:16
<transcript>: Owl or.

01:26:21
<transcript>: Have you used the Arc browser? I have latent. I've used it.

01:26:25
<transcript>: Yeah as Sardo, the Alpha Scale is meant to be used.

01:26:25
<transcript>: like i used

01:26:34
<transcript>: Like I used it in public. Dev a lot because you're overlaying. Oh, good night, Schneach. I missed it. Sorry. Almost 05:00 a.m. Wow. Wait, what.

01:26:40
<transcript>: Oh, you're on the West Coast? Geez, you stayed up.

01:26:42
<transcript>: You're crazy.

01:26:50
<transcript>: Let's see. Yeah. So the Alpha scale is meant for, like, when you're overlaying different colors on top of each other, they blend.

01:26:54
<transcript>: But it doesn't work the way I was using it.

01:26:54
phdhorrible: I would use Ctrl-V for block select to delete blocks of text like that

01:27:00
shn4ke: i have weird sleep schedule because of work

01:27:01
<transcript>: You use the Arch browser. Yeah. Yeah. So I did. You just got the invite? I think it's actually kind of nice. I just haven't really.

01:27:01
<transcript>: invested in it yet

01:27:02
<transcript>: Invested in it yet.

01:27:02
<transcript>: and

01:27:04
<transcript>: And I'm just used to Chrome.

01:27:04
<transcript>: do we leave

01:27:06
<transcript>: Do we leave.

01:27:06
<transcript>: thanks so much

01:27:12
<transcript>: Thanks so much for the follow. I appreciate your follows. I really do. Every single follow means a lot to me.

01:27:12
<transcript>: means

01:27:22
<transcript>: Means when I stream tomorrow, there will probably be more people showing up to hang out with me. And that's really great. I really did. I started streaming on a whim. I had all this video equipment.

01:27:22
<transcript>: because

01:27:24
<transcript>: Because.

01:27:24
<transcript>: i was gonna

01:27:26
mhuggins7278: I've been using ARC like 2 weeks so far so good

01:27:32
<transcript>: I was gonna make a course. Still, that I'm making a course. Just generally, I want to shift my career into teaching, as opposed to working for clients.

01:27:32
<transcript>: i just

01:27:38
<transcript>: I just most of my career just working for clients. I'm kind of tired of it, so I want to teach others as much as I can.

01:27:38
<transcript>: and so

01:27:44
<transcript>: And so I bought all this video equipment. I have all this set up. I have, like, a studio in my office, basically.

01:27:56
do_whi_lee: how is everybody

01:27:59
<transcript>: And that is decide. One day, a couple months ago, I'm gonna stream on Twitch. That sounds fun. Let's try it. And I fell in love because it's like my work day. Except there are people here, and I never realized how much I wanted that experience. I've always worked alone. Mostly.

01:28:12
<transcript>: I don't really like having coworkers people who can tell me what to do or any of that. But I do like hanging out with other people that like technology, and that's all of you. And I thank you every one of you for following along.

01:28:12
<transcript>: it's been so much fun

01:28:13
<transcript>: It's been so much fun.

01:28:16
<transcript>: Control v.

01:28:18
stroopwafel26: I didn't like that Arc forced me to create an account without telling me why and what they will do with my data, so I deleted it after an hour or so MaxLOL

01:28:24
<transcript>: For blue select to delete block the text like that. Yeah, that's the thing about them. There's so many, so many ways.

01:28:31
<transcript>: Shift. Click the color. Okay, thank you. Panel. So that's how I could have seen the different color formats. Okay.

01:28:36
<transcript>: A weird sleeve schedule. I get it snake. I also have a weird sleep schedule.

01:28:41
<transcript>: Just always it's surprising to me when there's someone from the US watching my streams.

01:28:44
ryankhawkins: Nice

01:28:53
<transcript>: Are two weeks. So far, so good. Okay, I'm Huggins. So there's an endorsement for Arc. Hey, welcome to Chat. Do we Lee everybody. How is everybody? I can't speak for everybody. I can speak for myself and say that I'm doing great.

01:28:53
<transcript>: don

01:28:58
<transcript>: Don't like that. Art forced me to create an account without telling me why. Yeah. Now I get that.

01:29:04
<transcript>: I get that.

01:29:09
<transcript>: Okay. So now we've got blue. We've updated our blue color scheme.

01:29:15
<transcript>: And that looks like a nice blue. Let's go back. Oh, that's probably not the blue, actually.

01:29:15
<transcript>: oh i needed

01:29:19
<transcript>: Oh, I needed to lead all this? So I'm gonna do delete.

01:29:19
<transcript>: thirteen

01:29:21
<transcript>: 13 J. That.

01:29:21
<transcript>: i could

01:29:22
laytanl_: @stroopwafel26 You got a point there, why would I need an account

01:29:26
<transcript>: I could have also done, let's do another one. Let's delete.

01:29:29
<transcript>: Outside paragraph. Yeah.

01:29:29
<transcript>: that works

01:29:31
laytanl_: Not like it is syncing

01:29:31
<transcript>: That works. I like that a lot.

01:29:31
<transcript>: now let's

01:29:36
<transcript>: Now let's go back to here. And let's say.

01:29:36
<transcript>: text

01:29:39
<transcript>: Text so the background that was in document.

01:29:43
<transcript>: The background is blue, 800. Let's make that.

01:29:43
<transcript>: blue

01:29:45
<transcript>: Blue, eight.

01:29:46
stroopwafel26: I still have no idea, and I couldn't easily find the privacy policy, seemed shady to me

01:29:50
<transcript>: Let's go. Blue, three.

01:29:58
<transcript>: There we go. Blue three. Should be a nice Navy color. Look at that.

01:29:58
<transcript>: maybe

01:30:01
<transcript>: Maybe. I guess I should technically.

01:30:04
<transcript>: Technically I should use.

01:30:05
<transcript>: Two.

01:30:05
<transcript>: from like a

01:30:08
<transcript>: From like a radius standpoint.

01:30:09
laytanl_: I do like it so far though

01:30:11
<transcript>: Probably use two for a background.

01:30:17
<transcript>: Or is even is it supposed to be Wan even.

01:30:17
<transcript>: zero and one

01:30:18
<transcript>: Zero, and one.

01:30:18
<transcript>: might

01:30:22
<transcript>: Might need to be background colors? That's gonna be too dark, though.

01:30:22
<transcript>: i guess

01:30:25
<transcript>: I guess that's the point.

01:30:31
<transcript>: We'll read some of the Radius stuff. I think I like to.

01:30:31
<transcript>: think i don't

01:30:40
<transcript>: Think I don't know how to them, though. Okay, there we go. So there's our Navy blue, if you recall. Aws is kind of like a Navy and Orange color scheme for trying to fit in with that.

01:30:45
<transcript>: Okay.

01:30:45
<transcript>: let's go back

01:30:53
<transcript>: Let's go back to our rated color. Let's get an Orange color scheme. These colors are just all like they did a bunch of nerd stuff to make sure they all work together really well.

01:30:53
<transcript>: that's why i'm using

01:30:57
stroopwafel26: Yeah they have some really great UI ideas but I value my privacy over anything else

01:31:02
<transcript>: That's why I'm using the Radics color schemes. And they just have all these. I'll show you. They have some, like, really nice rules. Like heuristics.

01:31:02
<transcript>: around

01:31:04
<transcript>: Around.

01:31:04
<transcript>: on

01:31:13
<transcript>: On the yank outside the brackets around how you choose what color to use for like certain components and things like that.

01:31:13
<transcript>: orange

01:31:14
<transcript>: Orange.

01:31:16
<transcript>: Taste.

01:31:22
<transcript>: We're gonna remove all the oranges, so I'm gonna delete one, two, six letters.

01:31:26
<transcript>: Like that. And then I can just do this.

01:31:33
<transcript>: We need macros when you can just hit period and do the thing so it's.

01:31:35
<transcript>: Orange.

01:31:38
<transcript>: Let's go back over here.

01:31:40
mhuggins7278: have you checked out https://coolors.co/ for finding color palletts

01:31:45
<transcript>: Oh, I want to delete this thing.

01:31:47
<transcript>: Let's just.

01:31:50
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:31:52
<transcript>: Now I can go back over here.

01:31:52
<transcript>: background

01:31:57
<transcript>: Background blue. That's good. Let's go to index.

01:32:01
<transcript>: And let's say this is gonna be text.

01:32:01
<transcript>: gray

01:32:07
<transcript>: Gray. Three. So the background of the button should not be white. The background of the button should be.

01:32:09
<transcript>: Blue.

01:32:09
<transcript>: what i want

01:32:11
<transcript>: What I want to do here.

01:32:18
<transcript>: For the for the buttons so the background is Navy blue. The buttons should probably be.

01:32:21
<transcript>: Navy Blue, as well.

01:32:28
<transcript>: Blue for maybe.

01:32:36
<transcript>: Orange will not be 500. It'll be.

01:32:41
<transcript>: Eight.

01:32:48
<transcript>: This is. Look, the scales. Let's see. Radics.

01:32:48
<transcript>: has

01:32:55
<transcript>: Has understanding the scale so here we go. App background Subtle Background UI element background should be three.

01:32:59
<transcript>: So here should be three.

01:33:02
<transcript>: So bad at them.

01:33:10
<transcript>: And then borders, UI element, border and focus rings. Should be seven. This is what I was talking about. This is why I love Radics.

01:33:10
<transcript>: so this

01:33:13
<transcript>: So this should be Orange. Seven.

01:33:19
<transcript>: Not those things that I'm typing.

01:33:19
<transcript>: none of that

01:33:21
<transcript>: None of that.

01:33:24
<transcript>: Okay. And then.

01:33:24
<transcript>: shad

01:33:26
<transcript>: Shadows.

01:33:29
<transcript>: Hovered Solid Backgrounds UI element.

01:33:29
<transcript>: settle

01:33:32
<transcript>: Settle borders.

01:33:32
<transcript>: i guess

01:33:36
<transcript>: I guess I want to make it the same as it should be seven as well. Right.

01:33:39
<transcript>: Here.

01:33:47
<transcript>: That's kind of dull. It's very dull.

01:33:51
<transcript>: Is there a bright Orange color.

01:33:55
<transcript>: I have the bright colors.

01:33:55
<transcript>: ah

01:34:01
<transcript>: Ah, Amber. There we go. So what? I want? No, that's not. That's not attractive.

01:34:01
<transcript>: seven looks

01:34:04
<transcript>: Seven. Looks like vomit.

01:34:12
<transcript>: So Orange, I'm just gonna go brighter. I'm gonna have to do the nine. I think nine is the one that this is, like, the most.

01:34:12
<transcript>: like

01:34:13
<transcript>: Like the color.

01:34:16
<transcript>: Replace that with nine.

01:34:19
<transcript>: That with nine.

01:34:24
<transcript>: That looks pretty good. So then text is gonna be like.

01:34:24
<transcript>: eleven

01:34:25
<transcript>: Eleven.

01:34:28
<transcript>: Pink.

01:34:28
<transcript>: eleven

01:34:31
<transcript>: Eleven is your Gray color.

01:34:35
<transcript>: Oh, where did a fog go.

01:34:37
<transcript>: There it is.

01:34:37
<transcript>: it's like

01:34:40
<transcript>: It's like Eleven and twelve.

01:34:43
<transcript>: But twelve is like you're.

01:34:47
stroopwafel26: that's a nice looking button

01:34:48
<transcript>: Most emphasized. Eleven. Is your.

01:34:48
<transcript>: emphas

01:34:53
<transcript>: Emphasized text. So for a button, I guess maybe this should actually be the Orange color.

01:34:53
<transcript>: i look like

01:34:55
<transcript>: I look like.

01:34:58
<transcript>: Orange.

01:34:59
<transcript>: Nine.

01:35:02
<transcript>: That might be better.

01:35:02
<transcript>: okay

01:35:03
<transcript>: Okay.

01:35:07
<transcript>: We're gonna have a nice logo for AWS, up here.

01:35:14
<transcript>: That's a nice looking button.

01:35:14
<transcript>: cool

01:35:15
<transcript>: Coolers.

01:35:15
<transcript>: in huggins

01:35:19
<transcript>: In Huggins. I have used schoolers. I think it's really cool.

01:35:22
<transcript>: But.

01:35:29
<transcript>: In this case, I know I want my color scheme to be kind of like Navy and Orange to match AWS.

01:35:33
<transcript>: And we have a Radiks to guide us.

01:35:36
<transcript>: Okay. So I'm gonna do.

01:35:43
<transcript>: I'm gonna do some other things here. We're gonna have some Hover. States. Hover is going to make the border.

01:35:43
<transcript>: i don't know

01:35:46
<transcript>: I don't know if you can tell that I have the P now Orange.

01:35:46
<transcript>: pin

01:35:48
<transcript>: Pin.

01:35:50
<transcript>: How's.

01:35:56
<transcript>: That after.

01:35:56
<transcript>: after

01:36:00
<transcript>: After Background Orange so Hover after.

01:36:00
<transcript>: background

01:36:02
<transcript>: Background Orange tin.

01:36:06
<transcript>: Let's Hover that.

01:36:11
<transcript>: Need to be eleven or something else. Okay, I'm gonna have to break.

01:36:15
<transcript>: What are we hour and 36 minutes in.

01:36:20
<transcript>: We're just getting started. We're gonna make this game actually work. I kind of got bogged down a little bit styling it.

01:36:20
<transcript>: that always signs

01:36:27
<transcript>: That always signs me forever. We're gonna build the actual game logic. I think when I come back and just forget about the colors for a bit.

01:36:27
<transcript>: because

01:36:34
<transcript>: Because we got a lot to do to make it multiplayer and do all that stuff. We just kind of got started, so, all right, I'm gonna take a break.

01:40:16
stroopwafel26: Looks like Adobe is buying Figma, joining the dark side I see

01:49:55
<transcript>: Adobe is buying Figma.

01:49:56
<transcript>: No.

01:50:02
<transcript>: A serious Stroop.

01:50:06
<transcript>: Is that a joke.

01:50:11
<transcript>: I guess. Why would you joke about that? That's terrible.

01:50:14
<transcript>: No vigma's, so good.

01:50:16
<transcript>: No.

01:50:22

01:50:32
stroopwafel26: TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS

01:50:39
<transcript>: 20 billion. Oh, good for the Figma Founders, I guess.

01:50:42
<transcript>: Jeez.

01:50:44
<transcript>: That kind of sucks.

01:50:50
<transcript>: Are they just gonna kill Figma.

01:50:56
<transcript>: Okay. Well.

01:50:56
<transcript>: i can't

01:50:58
<transcript>: I can't blame the founders.

01:50:58
<transcript>: can't blame them

01:51:00
<transcript>: Can't blame them.

01:51:00
<transcript>: for doing that

01:51:01
<transcript>: For doing that.

01:51:03
cristhianjhlcom: Hello, how you make your tabs (awguess/nvim/node) with color :P

01:51:04
<transcript>: Or any of the stakeholders, but.

01:51:04
<transcript>: just

01:51:06
<transcript>: Just a bummer.

01:51:10
<transcript>: Why can't we this is why we can't have a nice things, you know.

01:51:10
<transcript>: how you

01:51:14

01:51:18
<transcript>: Christian, what do you mean with color.

01:51:18
<transcript>: i

01:51:24
<transcript>: I use Dracula, so I use Dracula theme for my.

01:51:27
<transcript>: Timox.

01:51:27
<transcript>: and

01:51:28
<transcript>: And.

01:51:28
<transcript>: alec alac

01:51:30
<transcript>: Alec alacrity.

01:51:33
stroopwafel26: figma had a good run, now it'll probably be a subscription wrapped in with something like photoshop

01:51:38
<transcript>: Well, I guess it's not alacrity. It's Neovem. I use Dracula and Neovem, and I use it in Team X. It on everything. So it's Dracula.

01:51:38
<transcript>: so i do

01:51:46
<transcript>: So I do the Colors figmatic. Good run. Now it'll probably be a subscription wrapped in with something like Photoshop. Yeah. I mean, if they don't, if they don't ruin the product.

01:51:48
cristhianjhlcom: ahh is a tmux thing? ok Clap

01:51:54
<transcript>: Then I'll pay for it. I already pay for Figma. I'll pay whatever. I mean, I already pay for Creative Cloud. I don't really use it.

01:52:01
<transcript>: As the Team X thing. Yeah, the top bar there is Timux, and then the bottom bar is neovem.

01:52:08
<transcript>: Alright.

01:52:09
<transcript>: Let's.

01:52:09
<transcript>: let

01:52:11
<transcript>: Let's make some progress here.

01:52:17
stroopwafel26: bottom bar, top bar, larabar

01:52:22
<transcript>: Get serious. So we did some theming. I don't know if it made it that much better, but we did some stuff. We have a new phone.

01:52:22
<transcript>: we have

01:52:23
<transcript>: We have a color scheme.

01:52:25
<transcript>: New game.

01:52:25
<transcript>: okay

01:52:26
<transcript>: Okay.

01:52:26
<transcript>: i should probably

01:52:32
<transcript>: I should probably change the text color on Hover, too. And then we're gonna we're gonna start building real stuff.

01:52:33
<transcript>: Hover.

01:52:35
cristhianjhlcom: im pretty new on this vim world LUL

01:52:39
<transcript>: Text Orange. I think actually eleven might be better.

01:52:42
schrew: Gm adam! I've got to write 10 peer feedbacks today, any tips you've learned through your years of working alone? LUL

01:52:47
<transcript>: Yeah. Should all that change? Or just the border? I don't know.

01:52:56
<transcript>: I'm not sure. Good morning. Shrew. Got to write Tin Peer Feedback today. Any tips you've learned through your years of working alone.

01:53:01
<transcript>: Yeah, I had a startup, and I actually had employees for a bit.

01:53:01
<transcript>: and

01:53:02
<transcript>: And.

01:53:02
<transcript>: we did not

01:53:04
<transcript>: We did not do.

01:53:04
<transcript>: review

01:53:10
<transcript>: Reviews of any kind. We tried to give feedback all the time. We tried.

01:53:10
<transcript>: jake tell

01:53:12
<transcript>: Jake, tell you if we were any good at it.

01:53:15
<transcript>: It probably pretty bad at it actually.

01:53:18
<transcript>: So you.

01:53:25
<transcript>: Got this new game button? You click on it. Let's go to the server.

01:53:28
<transcript>: Game router.

01:53:36
<transcript>: And I want to see why are things so slow on first on the first mutation.

01:53:36
<transcript>: seems to be

01:53:41
<transcript>: Seems to be really slow. So this new one, we create a game.

01:53:41
<transcript>: and then we

01:53:44
<transcript>: And then we create a round based on that game.

01:53:49
<transcript>: We're turning around for some reason this is really slow.

01:53:52
<transcript>: And I wonder.

01:53:52
<transcript>: too

01:53:58
<transcript>: Too. Let's see there's the router index. I'm not doing any of that stuff anymore, am I.

01:53:58
<transcript>: resource

01:54:00
<transcript>: Resources.

01:54:05
<transcript>: Yeah. I should be doing this. This is a problem.

01:54:09
<transcript>: Okay.

01:54:10
stroopwafel26: @Schrew write LGTM 10 times like a good developer

01:54:11
<transcript>: That's that's the problem.

01:54:13
<transcript>: At least part of the problem.

01:54:18
<transcript>: So that I meant to remove all that.

01:54:24
<transcript>: Okay.

01:54:24
<transcript>: that

01:54:26
<transcript>: That should be faster now.

01:54:29
<transcript>: Example router we can clean this up right.

01:54:32
<transcript>: We can delete.

01:54:32
<transcript>: the example

01:54:34
<transcript>: The example router.

01:54:42
<transcript>: What's wrong with game now.

01:54:45
<transcript>: Prefix.

01:54:47
<transcript>: Hatchy.

01:54:51
<transcript>: Ow.

01:54:51
<transcript>: it's actually

01:54:55
<transcript>: It's actually got a prefix of Apache. I'm gonna remove that one.

01:55:00
<transcript>: Okay, that's all the issues.

01:55:02
<transcript>: Okay.

01:55:04
<transcript>: So.

01:55:10
<transcript>: We should be fast now that's the good news.

01:55:10
<transcript>: i might need to rest

01:55:14
<transcript>: I might need to restart the server. I don't know. I never know.

01:55:14
<transcript>: never know if

01:55:18
<transcript>: Never know if I need to restart stuff? We're gonna do it.

01:55:22
<transcript>: So I don't know.

01:55:33
<transcript>: Here we go.

01:55:45
<transcript>: To me Looks good to me.

01:55:51
<transcript>: I do a lot of looks good to me in code reviews.

01:55:53
schrew: @stroopwafel26 idk, some of these people aren't looking so good to me monkaS

01:55:56
<transcript>: Okay. That's that's I just noticed that my.

01:56:02
<transcript>: Green screen is just slightly off one SEC.

01:56:11
stroopwafel26: @Schrew fire them using a giphy

01:56:13
<transcript>: Worse.

01:56:13
el_robertolo: How is neovim treating you? I tried it. Got annoyed by vim. Then I got annoyed that I constantly have to move my hand to my mouse. I’m in a limbo

01:56:16
<transcript>: Better.

01:56:16
<transcript>: better

01:56:22
<transcript>: Better. Has ne of them treating me L Roberto, it is treating me great. I love it.

01:56:22
<transcript>: the new

01:56:31
<transcript>: The new vamp. So the thing is, you tried it. You got annoyed by them. Then I got annoyed that I constantly have to move my hand in my mouth. Yeah. Limbo. I've heard this. I've heard people say.

01:56:31
<transcript>: they're stuck

01:56:36
<transcript>: They're stuck because maybe they've had just enough.

01:56:36
<transcript>: good stuff

01:56:43
<transcript>: Good stuff happen with new of them and vim that they want to stick around but they still don't really note as well as their old editor.

01:56:43
<transcript>: for me i

01:56:43
cowfacedude99: @el_robertolo I think you just have to push on.

01:56:48
<transcript>: For me. I just had to say, I'm all in, like I'm not going back. So I better just start getting comfortable.

01:56:48
<transcript>: with that mind

01:56:56
<transcript>: With that mindset, I feel like it helps you avoid the limbo state. It's like I know I'm not as good at certain things as I was in vs. Code yet, but I know I'll get there.

01:57:17
<transcript>: The thing like them is the main thing. I mean, vim is the thing that I'm learning. Neovan was like I learned how to configure it the first couple weeks. Like what plugins. I cared about, what experiences I want to bring over from vs. Code. I'm still learning there's still stuff still to do, things I want to add. But for the most part, it's learning all the vim motions. And it's been very rewarding for me.

01:57:17
<transcript>: i think

01:57:18
<transcript>: I think.

01:57:18
<transcript>: i

01:57:19
<transcript>: I.

01:57:19
<transcript>: was hooked

01:57:23
<transcript>: Was hooked pretty quick on some of the things that are just so much more efficient.

01:57:30
schrew: @stroopwafel26 /giphy wolf of wall street

01:57:31
<transcript>: There's still things I missed from vs. Code things that I won't ever have in the event because I just have to learn the other ways of doing it like multicursor.

01:57:44
<transcript>: I like multicursor a lot. I used it a lot, but it probably was the wrong way to do things, and I just need to go out, like go out and learn macros and just get good at them. Approaches.

01:57:48
<transcript>: Yeah. So that's my stance.

01:57:48
<transcript>: yeah

01:57:48
stroopwafel26: MaxLOL

01:57:54
<transcript>: Yeah, just have to push on. You have to tell yourself you're not going back if you're convinced that it's gonna be better for you.

01:57:54
mhuggins7278: Yeah it's like cold water you either jump in with both feet or you'll waffel forever

01:58:04
<transcript>: I love new of him as a hobby and I love the prospects of them in terms of using my mouthless and just better ergonomics at my desk.

01:58:09
<transcript>: Yeah, cold weather. Either jump in with both feet or you'll waffle forever. That's right.

01:58:12
<transcript>: You'll Stroop. Waffle forever.

01:58:18
<transcript>: Okay so we this should be fast now when I click new game.

01:58:18
<transcript>: it should be

01:58:23
stroopwafel26: more people should stroopwafel imo

01:58:25
<transcript>: It should be fast, but it's not because we're still importing example which is breaking everything.

01:58:25
el_robertolo: Im not faster with vim for sure. But keeping in that flow state

01:58:28
<transcript>: Api. Example. Let's delete all these.

01:58:31
<transcript>: Let's delete them all.

01:58:32
cowfacedude99: we need a vim channel on discord LUL

01:58:33
<transcript>: Example.

01:58:33
<transcript>: get out of here

01:58:37
<transcript>: Get out of here. Example. Wait a minute. What is this example.

01:58:40
el_robertolo: Not having to look at@the keyboard when repositioning hands.

01:58:42
<transcript>: Find mini so it's fetching all the examples. Okay, not hurting anything, I guess.

01:58:49
<transcript>: But I do need to remove.

01:58:52
<transcript>: Here any.

01:58:52
<transcript>: stuff

01:58:56
<transcript>: Stuff where it's grabbing. What was that.

01:58:56
<transcript>: in index

01:58:57
<transcript>: In index.

01:59:01
<transcript>: Oh, really? I thought it removed the already.

01:59:08
barneyoftherubble: In VISUAL BLOCK mode you can kind of do multi cursor

01:59:10
<transcript>: Not removed the imports of examples. Yeah, I did not write it.

01:59:10
<transcript>: oh

01:59:13
<transcript>: Oh, didn't write it. Okay, cool.

01:59:13
<transcript>: it's

01:59:17
<transcript>: It's important to save your files, folks. You heard it here first.

01:59:17
<transcript>: thank you for the follow

01:59:21
stroopwafel26: To stroopwafel: to be in multiple clubs with @adamdotdev

01:59:24
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow in Hz MHz. If you had something you want me to call you, let me know.

01:59:27
<transcript>: You can kind of do multicursor.

01:59:30
<transcript>: Invisible block mode.

01:59:34
<transcript>: I'm curious, Barney. How.

01:59:37
<transcript>: Need a Vim channel and discord. Yes, we do.

01:59:40
<transcript>: I agree.

01:59:48
<transcript>: That's right being multiple clubs with me.

01:59:48
<transcript>: we are

01:59:52
<transcript>: We are in so many clubs Streep we are the same person if I click on new game now.

01:59:52
<transcript>: it's

01:59:55
<transcript>: It's still slow, so it's still slow.

01:59:57
<transcript>: Not great.

01:59:57
<transcript>: okay

02:00:05
<transcript>: Okay, so how do we want to change? I really gotta fix the the button thing. We also need to do like some mobile layout stuff.

02:00:05
<transcript>: like

02:00:07
<transcript>: Like that's not great.

02:00:08
myst3rymage: ctrl+v = visual block mode

02:00:08
barneyoftherubble: Paste a block of the colours again for example text

02:00:09
<transcript>: If it's on.

02:00:09
<transcript>: iphone

02:00:11
<transcript>: Iphone Twelve pro.

02:00:15
<transcript>: That's what it looks like. Let's fix it.

02:00:20
<transcript>: Let's see Flex should be.

02:00:32
<transcript>: Now, what is this? What? I just do it's in the round that I need.

02:00:33
barneyoftherubble: Then ctrl + v then you can do it

02:00:38
<transcript>: Round. Here we go.

02:00:38
<transcript>: so

02:00:42
<transcript>: So this should be like small flex.

02:00:44
<transcript>: Yeah, Yeah.

02:00:45
cowfacedude99: reactive stuff is a pain

02:00:51
<transcript>: So that still looks pretty good. Okay, we're gonna add a border to that image to look kind of like our button.

02:00:51
<transcript>: the buttons

02:00:54
<transcript>: The buttons, though these should be.

02:00:58
<transcript>: Small so like that we should do.

02:01:00
el_robertolo: Reactive stuff is nice. It’s such a nice concept.

02:01:04
<transcript>: Is it not? I'm not getting prettier sorting on my tailwind classes, am I.

02:01:05
el_robertolo: Event driven stuff in generell

02:01:06
<transcript>: Space.

02:01:06
<transcript>: wise

02:01:08
<transcript>: Wise y.

02:01:09
el_robertolo: Idk why people don’t like it

02:01:11
<transcript>: yeez

02:01:12
<transcript>: Yeez.

02:01:15
<transcript>: Space, wide.

02:01:25
<transcript>: X? Okay.

02:01:29
<transcript>: Oh.

02:01:29
<transcript>: did i just

02:01:30
mhzrerfani: you can use gap also

02:01:31
<transcript>: Did I just what did I do.

02:01:31
<transcript>: suspend

02:01:33
<transcript>: Suspended. Envym.

02:01:40
cowfacedude99: reactive as in media queries for webpages. not architecture.

02:01:45
<transcript>: What was ion.

02:01:48
madlep: type `fg` to get it back

02:01:52
<transcript>: Oh, what am I? Where am I? This is my overlay.

02:01:52
<transcript>: why is it what

02:01:53
<transcript>: Why is it? What.

02:01:58
el_robertolo: Oh. Yeah @cowfacedude99 100%

02:01:59
<transcript>: Do I do.

02:01:59
<transcript>: that i suspend

02:02:00
madlep: it's suspended the process

02:02:01
<transcript>: That I suspended in vim.

02:02:04
<transcript>: My.

02:02:04
<transcript>: yeah

02:02:05
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:02:05
<transcript>: in them

02:02:06
tiredbeaver: do ps

02:02:09
<transcript>: In them. I'm in. Aws, right? Yeah.

02:02:09
<transcript>: weird

02:02:11
<transcript>: Weird.

02:02:23
tiredbeaver: another neovim process might be running

02:02:25
<transcript>: That was weird. It was pulling up my overlays like I was in my obly file. The Universe wants me to work on my overlays. I won't do it. Not doing it. Not today universe. Thanks for the following mystery mage.

02:02:28
el_robertolo: I feel like you gotta learn vim motions with words

02:02:33
tiredbeaver: probably not a big deal

02:02:34
<transcript>: Mhz welcome to Chat. You can use Gap. Also can I use Gap with flex.

02:02:36
<transcript>: Instead of space, y.

02:02:36
<transcript>: you're saying i could

02:02:38
<transcript>: You're saying I could do.

02:02:38
<transcript>: gap

02:02:39
<transcript>: Gap.

02:02:39
<transcript>: for

02:02:40
el_robertolo: Like b = back. E= end. A= after

02:02:42
<transcript>: For five.

02:02:45
<transcript>: Is that just a grid thing.

02:02:45
<transcript>: gap is

02:02:46
<transcript>: Gap is for grid.

02:02:46
<transcript>: is there like

02:02:47
el_robertolo: Any other tricks ?

02:02:48
<transcript>: Is there like a flex gap.

02:02:48
<transcript>: that sounds familiar

02:02:50
<transcript>: That sounds familiar.

02:02:53
<transcript>: A Flex gap.

02:02:56
<transcript>: Space, y.

02:02:57
<transcript>: yup

02:02:58
<transcript>: Yup.

02:02:59
cowfacedude99: @el_robertolo get used to moving around with f and t.

02:03:02
<transcript>: But we only want to do that.

02:03:02
<transcript>: so

02:03:06
stroopwafel26: You need to make sure there's always enough space so the answers don't fall off the screen, maybe do a 2x2 grid?

02:03:08
<transcript>: So on small I want to get my prettier sorting to work space.

02:03:08
<transcript>: y

02:03:10
<transcript>: Y zero.

02:03:12
el_robertolo: Whats f and t ?

02:03:17
<transcript>: Okay, we got to fix lots of things. These button sizes are bad. We're gonna make them full width.

02:03:19
<transcript>: So.

02:03:23
<transcript>: With full.

02:03:23
<transcript>: but then on

02:03:25
<transcript>: But then on small.

02:03:25
<transcript>: we'll do

02:03:27
<transcript>: We'll do width auto.

02:03:29
el_robertolo: What do they stand for ?

02:03:30
<transcript>: Yeah, Yeah.

02:03:30
<transcript>: that didn't work though

02:03:32
cowfacedude99: go through vimtutor.

02:03:33
<transcript>: That didn't work though with Folden. Mark did it.

02:03:37
<transcript>: Oh, these have to be with full maybe.

02:03:39
<transcript>: You're the button.

02:03:39
<transcript>: the button

02:03:41
<transcript>: The button style.

02:03:46
<transcript>: I don't want to do that. Maybe these should just always be with full.

02:03:47
el_robertolo: Common. Just tell me

02:03:50
<transcript>: No, that was not the right thing to do.

02:03:53
<transcript>: That was not the right thing to do.

02:03:57
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow. Iced coffee. Ooh.

02:03:57
<transcript>: iced coffee

02:04:00
<transcript>: Iced coffee sounds so good right now. Also Paget.

02:04:00
<transcript>: welcome

02:04:02
<transcript>: Welcome.

02:04:11
cowfacedude99: f<char> goes to char and t<char> goes to one char before

02:04:12
<transcript>: Just reading back here mystery made welcome to check Ctrlv visual block mode.

02:04:12
<transcript>: okay

02:04:13
<transcript>: Okay.

02:04:16
<transcript>: Visual block mode.

02:04:16
<transcript>: what do you want me

02:04:21
el_robertolo: Damn. That sounds annoying

02:04:22
<transcript>: What do you want me to do? What do you all want me to do in that? Paste a block of the colors again, for example, text.

02:04:22
<transcript>: then

02:04:22
icedcoffefe: icedcoffee's always good

02:04:24
<transcript>: Then Control v.

02:04:25
el_robertolo: Gotta focus on characters

02:04:31
<transcript>: You can do it. I can do the multi. Oh, you're saying, like, yeah, we'll add another color pattern a little bit. And I'll ask you again, Barney.

02:04:31
<transcript>: or i'll just do

02:04:38
<transcript>: Or I'll just do it. I'll do control V, and we'll see if I can multicursor my way or like, sort of multicurse from my way into it.

02:04:47
<transcript>: Reactive as in media queries for web pages, not architecture. Type FG to get it back FG. You get what back.

02:04:47
<transcript>: oh

02:04:49
<transcript>: Oh, it's suspended. The process.

02:04:49
<transcript>: so

02:04:50
<transcript>: So.

02:04:50
<transcript>: why what

02:04:53
<transcript>: Why? What was that? Timucks did that.

02:05:04
<transcript>: Another Neoven process might be running. Feel like you got to learn vim motions with words. Probably not a big deal. I'm just reading everything now.

02:05:10
<transcript>: Vim tutor. I really need to do that sometimes.

02:05:10
<transcript>: i

02:05:13
<transcript>: I need to finish it. I started it.

02:05:13
<transcript>: you guys

02:05:15
cowfacedude99: seriously got through :h motions

02:05:19
<transcript>: You guys are just explaining to someone how to. Yeah, yeah. Okay. You're explaining to somebody how to them.

02:05:23
<transcript>: Ice coffee is always good.

02:05:23
<transcript>: always good

02:05:27
<transcript>: Always good. Let's see. So button I want to make the button.

02:05:27
<transcript>: down here

02:05:28
<transcript>: Down here.

02:05:34
<transcript>: This should be well, we'll do it up here. We can specify the class name.

02:05:36
<transcript>: Like this.

02:05:39
<transcript>: Last name.

02:05:41
<transcript>: With full.

02:05:45
<transcript>: You're gonna do that, but then we want to do.

02:05:50
<transcript>: Small with Auto. Right. Okay.

02:05:52
<transcript>: More wise.

02:06:05
<transcript>: The shadow kind of throws off the margins and stuff.

02:06:15
<transcript>: See what I'm saying? Oh, and we got no top. Do it have like a side padding or something? Why is there? I'm getting some padding on the side, but I don't remember.

02:06:15
<transcript>: ever

02:06:18
<transcript>: Ever adding any container.

02:06:18
<transcript>: what is that

02:06:19
<transcript>: What is that.

02:06:23
<transcript>: Max width. Okay.

02:06:25
cowfacedude99: Once you get used to basic motions, you can start playing with motion extenders. like sneak or lightspeed or it's newer cousin.

02:06:26
<transcript>: Is there a.

02:06:30
<transcript>: Oh, there's a padding right there. Padding for.

02:06:30
<transcript>: it's not working

02:06:32
<transcript>: It's not working on the top though.

02:06:37
<transcript>: See that.

02:06:40
<transcript>: No padding on top.

02:06:46
<transcript>: Well, because here we have height screen justify Center.

02:06:49
<transcript>: Let's do some padding on this thing.

02:06:52
<transcript>: Py.

02:06:54
<transcript>: I don't know.

02:07:01
<transcript>: Nothing. I guess that wouldn't work the way I'm laying things out.

02:07:01
<transcript>: there

02:07:03
cowfacedude99: I think it's something you need to get used to, by including it in your workflow.

02:07:03
<transcript>: There this height, screen, nonsense.

02:07:05
<transcript>: There we go.

02:07:10
<transcript>: And I did that because on this view.

02:07:14
<transcript>: Reset.

02:07:17
<transcript>: On this view, here.

02:07:19
<transcript>: Oh, it's still centered.

02:07:25
<transcript>: Flex call. Okay. I didn't need to do the screen height thing.

02:07:30
<transcript>: Okay so then mobile view.

02:07:34
<transcript>: Looks like that.

02:07:40
<transcript>: These are these shadows are kind of messing with the Padding aesthetic, but I don't know. I'm not.

02:07:52
<transcript>: A border to the image as well.

02:07:55
<transcript>: I think.

02:07:55
<transcript>: not a border

02:07:57
<transcript>: Not a border, but like.

02:07:59
<transcript>: The after stuff.

02:07:59
<transcript>: i think

02:08:02
<transcript>: I think I want to do that. I'm not entirely sure.

02:08:02
<transcript>: that was

02:08:04
<transcript>: That was this stuff right here.

02:08:07
<transcript>: Here.

02:08:10
<transcript>: So I want to copy.

02:08:13
bowdy: Do you have a tailwind language provider installed or how do you get those auto completions?

02:08:13
<transcript>: Everything inside of there.

02:08:20
<transcript>: Paste it.

02:08:24
<transcript>: At work.

02:08:28
<transcript>: After.

02:08:54
<transcript>: A.

02:09:00
<transcript>: T right.

02:10:13
<transcript>: Now it should be happy yeah, yeah? Prettier plugin, tail and CSS.

02:10:17
<transcript>: I guess that's also Dev. Maybe. I don't know.

02:10:23
<transcript>: And then I need to add this to prettier config.

02:10:23
<transcript>: so let's

02:10:24
<transcript>: So let's go to.

02:10:31
<transcript>: Prettier config don't think I did. I think I just used put it in package JSON.

02:10:35
<transcript>: I don't think I can do that. I'm gonna have to go here.

02:10:37
<transcript>: Prettier.

02:10:41
<transcript>: Config CJS.

02:10:43
mhuggins7278: Do you have telescope installed?

02:10:45
<transcript>: And let's just do this.

02:10:46
ingenol: that's a cool prompt! Are your dotfiles anywhere?

02:10:48
<transcript>: Okay.

02:10:50
<transcript>: And then also.

02:10:55
stroopwafel26: !github

02:10:55
fossabot: Adam's dotfiles live here: https://github.com/adamelmore/dotfiles

02:11:08
<transcript>: Okay. Now if I save this, does it sort them.

02:11:09
<transcript>: No.

02:11:09
<transcript>: vins

02:11:13
<transcript>: Vins or them, did it? No. Why didn't sort them.

02:11:16
<transcript>: Your plugin not working.

02:11:24
<transcript>: Dr.

02:11:36
<transcript>: Yeah. Engine off. Welcome to Chat. You found my dot files. I do have telescope installed. Wait, are you guys talking something else.

02:11:36
<transcript>: i do have jealous

02:11:38
<transcript>: I do have jealouscope. Yes.

02:11:45
<transcript>: I'll just restart it. So just see if that fixes it. Sometimes it just fixes it.

02:11:54
<transcript>: I save all the files.

02:12:00
<transcript>: That didn't reorder them, did it? No.

02:12:00
<transcript>: no

02:12:01
<transcript>: No.

02:12:06
<transcript>: There's a PM. Oh, this gets me to add the plugin to your preterconfigure explicitly.

02:12:08
<transcript>: Did that.

02:12:14
mhuggins7278: are you using null-ls or something to format the ts, js

02:12:15
<transcript>: Prettier. Configs. Not right.

02:12:15
<transcript>: maybe

02:12:17
<transcript>: Maybe.

02:12:17
<transcript>: maybe

02:12:19
<transcript>: Maybe not.

02:12:19
<transcript>: maybe

02:12:21
<transcript>: Maybe we can't be explicit.

02:12:38
mhuggins7278: you have to tell the lsp to use prettier

02:12:38
<transcript>: This does not work with Prettier. D.

02:12:44
<transcript>: Prettier. D not work. You have to tell the LSP to use.

02:12:44
<transcript>: yeah i mean

02:12:48
<transcript>: Yeah. I mean, using no LS for the four Matting. That's right.

02:12:48
<transcript>: and

02:12:50
<transcript>: And it's definitely.

02:12:50
<transcript>: formatting with

02:12:54
<transcript>: Formatting with prettier. It's just not using the tailwind plugin.

02:12:59
<transcript>: Pm, and Dev.

02:13:01
<transcript>: Prettier Polygon.

02:13:03
<transcript>: Tell wind.

02:13:07
<transcript>: Added to Dev dependency thing. You should have done that from beginning.

02:13:10
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:13:12
<transcript>: Not working.

02:13:17
<transcript>: Maybe it's because I have is it because I have the semi in here.

02:13:17
<transcript>: as a pretier conf

02:13:20
<transcript>: As a pretier config. Let's try this.

02:13:25
<transcript>: Try this into.

02:13:30
<transcript>: I'm using Prettier. D.

02:13:33
<transcript>: Under if there's a problem with prettier D.

02:13:43
<transcript>: It works, it worked, it worked, it worked, it worked cool love when things work.

02:13:44
<transcript>: Goodbye.

02:13:48
<transcript>: Really? That was our first try.

02:13:51
<transcript>: Okay.

02:13:55
<transcript>: Over here.

02:13:55
<transcript>: and

02:14:00
<transcript>: And Whoa, that's why I had the Max, the screen height thing.

02:14:02
cowfacedude99: guess it was a file resolution issue

02:14:03
<transcript>: There's a new game button.

02:14:10
<transcript>: How can I make that new game button? Not.

02:14:13
<transcript>: Jsv.

02:14:13
<transcript>: thanks so much for the

02:14:14
<transcript>: Thanks so much for the follow.

02:14:24
<transcript>: I appreciate it. Five resolution issue. Yeah, I guess so. Or by specifying in the package JSON. I specifies some prettier config. Maybe that overroad, overrote.

02:14:27
<transcript>: The explicit file.

02:14:29
<transcript>: Okay.

02:14:37
<transcript>: I'm trying to get into the Coolest Club with T Three, and that's how they did it. They were explicit.

02:14:37
<transcript>: so let's

02:14:39
<transcript>: So let's see.

02:14:39
<transcript>: we'll know if it

02:14:41
<transcript>: We'll know if it broke, right.

02:14:51
<transcript>: See, I wouldn't have it would have semicolon. If it broke this prettier. Wouldn't have my semi config. Okay. Cool. Yeah. It's still working.

02:14:57
<transcript>: Okay, let's let's make some stuff so new game.

02:14:57
<transcript>: is

02:15:06
<transcript>: Is slow. Still, we're not sure why that's a slow. We'll fix that at some point those are not full width now with full.

02:15:12
<transcript>: Should go to width auto, but they should be with full right now.

02:15:14
<transcript>: They're not.

02:15:18
<transcript>: Now I can actually do the font.

02:15:18
<transcript>: color

02:15:21
<transcript>: Color. Now we have some colors. It can be text.

02:15:21
<transcript>: orange

02:15:23
<transcript>: Orange.

02:15:23
<transcript>: eleven

02:15:24
<transcript>: Eleven.

02:15:24
<transcript>: no

02:15:25
<transcript>: No.

02:15:30
<transcript>: What am I using right now? Nine. So I need to use like eight.

02:15:30
<transcript>: kind of going

02:15:33
<transcript>: Kind of going against the Radics principles.

02:15:35
<transcript>: But.

02:15:40
<transcript>: New game.

02:15:44
<transcript>: That does. That looks awful. It looks terrible.

02:16:06
<transcript>: It keeps losing the font family. Why aren't those full width? Why aren't those full width.

02:16:14
<transcript>: Maybe this container isn't full width.

02:16:23
<transcript>: Full I don't know.

02:16:25
<transcript>: Should be.

02:16:25
<transcript>: up here

02:16:29
<transcript>: Up here. Mx Auto, flex.

02:16:32
<transcript>: Min height screen.

02:16:37
<transcript>: Well, that's what I do? Minn height screen. That's what I needed to do.

02:16:39
<transcript>: This container up here.

02:16:43
<transcript>: Minhe, screen.

02:16:53
<transcript>: Just to steal everything they did down here with this container. Oh, it's container. Okay, let's just put this all on this thing.

02:16:53
<transcript>: container

02:16:54
<transcript>: Container.

02:16:58
<transcript>: We'll move it off from this stuff.

02:17:01
<transcript>: Mx auto need to add that.

02:17:08
<transcript>: Max auto.

02:17:18
<transcript>: Container MX out of flex.

02:17:23
<transcript>: And then min height screen all this can go.

02:17:26
<transcript>: Item center justify some.

02:17:33
<transcript>: P four should also go up there, right.

02:17:34
catmodev: Hello

02:17:36
<transcript>: Items center just by Center.

02:17:39
<transcript>: P, four.

02:17:42
<transcript>: Remove it from here.

02:17:45
<transcript>: So this actually reflects column.

02:17:45
<transcript>: i don't know

02:17:48
<transcript>: I don't know. Should you even have a Div? I guess so.

02:17:51
<transcript>: I guess so. It could be a fragment.

02:17:57
<transcript>: So now when I refresh and it says, the new Game button. Yeah. Looks good.

02:18:02
<transcript>: Okay. I don't know why those aren't full width. Let's look Oops.

02:18:09
<transcript>: Inspect. Senate. It's full width.

02:18:09
<transcript>: but

02:18:12
<transcript>: But this button is not.

02:18:14
<transcript>: Full width.

02:18:16
<transcript>: Why is it not.

02:18:18
<transcript>: Why is it not full whip.

02:18:21
<transcript>: Let's see here style.

02:18:23
<transcript>: Computed.

02:18:32
<transcript>: Does not have a full width the width full class on it.

02:18:37
<transcript>: With full oh. It also has a Whip 64 Oh.

02:18:37
<transcript>: it's just getting

02:18:39
<transcript>: It's just getting overridden.

02:18:42
<transcript>: Where is that with full.

02:18:45
<transcript>: All would be with auto.

02:18:47
<transcript>: Here, we have.

02:18:47
<transcript>: width

02:18:48
<transcript>: Width.

02:18:53
<transcript>: Where is it? 64? With 64.

02:19:02
<transcript>: Oh, it's actually in the button styles down here. Yeah, Yeah.

02:19:02
<transcript>: with

02:19:03
<transcript>: With 64.

02:19:03
<transcript>: right there

02:19:06
<transcript>: Right there. That's bad.

02:19:10
<transcript>: Need to do like this. Maybe.

02:19:13
<transcript>: Small width.

02:19:15
<transcript>: 64.

02:19:17
<transcript>: Okay like that.

02:19:17
<transcript>: just

02:19:19
<transcript>: Just like that.

02:19:24
<transcript>: Okay. So we have new game. Let's look at it with this styling.

02:19:27
<transcript>: To just keep those in the flat family.

02:19:32
<transcript>: And that's just a Chrome thing. I've noticed that.

02:19:32
<transcript>: now

02:19:40
<transcript>: Now, here's what it looks like on Mobile. We got to fix the again. These are so long. Some of them are so, so long. But this is looking better.

02:19:45
<transcript>: I might make Amazon all uppercase.

02:19:47
<transcript>: So this right here.

02:19:51
<transcript>: Upper case.

02:20:03
<transcript>: And then the I guess the button sizes. Should this flow with the name of the service, or should I make the service names smaller.

02:20:10
<transcript>: It's like they're a good size there just maybe need to make the button.

02:20:12
<transcript>: Size.

02:20:12
<transcript>: where do i

02:20:17
<transcript>: Where do I have a height? 24. Okay, so if I remove that.

02:20:22
<transcript>: Now they can all be different sizes. Maybe that's okay.

02:20:22
<transcript>: i don't think

02:20:27
<transcript>: I don't think I'm gonna love it over here, though. Oh, oh, what happened.

02:20:27
<transcript>: broke

02:20:29
<transcript>: Broke all the layout.

02:20:33
<transcript>: So this view we need to fix.

02:20:35
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:20:38
<transcript>: Before Flex Flex call.

02:20:42
<transcript>: That's where the MX Auto came in, I guess.

02:20:56
<transcript>: So this has a width 96.

02:21:01
<transcript>: Let's run this in a Div. That's what we're gonna do earlier, dude.

02:21:01
<transcript>: i still need to learn

02:21:03
<transcript>: I still need to learn how to do this.

02:21:06
<transcript>: And then surround. But whatever.

02:21:08
<transcript>: Div.

02:21:14
<transcript>: Let's.

02:21:14
<transcript>: see

02:21:16
<transcript>: See class name.

02:21:21
<transcript>: Emex. Auto. There we go.

02:21:26
<transcript>: This. I could also just items.

02:21:26
<transcript>: center

02:21:28
<transcript>: Center.

02:21:31
<transcript>: Justifies center like that.

02:21:36
<transcript>: Would work as well.

02:21:36
<transcript>: so in

02:21:39
<transcript>: So in this one I want to do the after stuff.

02:21:39
<transcript>: i want to do

02:21:40
<transcript>: I want to do.

02:21:40
<transcript>: delet

02:21:43
<transcript>: Delete to quote.

02:21:46
<transcript>: And paste it in here.

02:21:50
<transcript>: Paste it in there.

02:21:52
<transcript>: Oh.

02:21:55
<transcript>: That's not what I'm meant to do.

02:21:57
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:22:09
<transcript>: Here. I guess I need to say.

02:22:09
<transcript>: wit

02:22:11
<transcript>: Wit.

02:22:11
<transcript>: ninety

02:22:13
<transcript>: 96.

02:22:13
<transcript>: aspect

02:22:14
<transcript>: Aspect.

02:22:14
<transcript>: where

02:22:15
<transcript>: Where.

02:22:23
<transcript>: No big no.

02:22:27
<transcript>: Hello, Cat nodev, Hello.

02:22:40
<transcript>: What did I do here? I tried to make a.

02:22:46
<transcript>: Those are inside of a Div.

02:22:50
<transcript>: So I guess the after should be on the image.

02:22:53
<transcript>: Now it's just.

02:22:56
<transcript>: Rid of the after idea.

02:22:56
<transcript>: i was trying to add

02:23:04
<transcript>: I was trying to add, like a border, just like I have on the buttons. Like that. Little shadow. Little Orange shadow. But maybe I don't do that. I don't know.

02:23:07
catmodev: tailwind giving headaches?

02:23:08
<transcript>: Aspect with 96.

02:23:12
<transcript>: So we need to make these buttons.

02:23:12
<transcript>: smaller

02:23:19
<transcript>: Smaller. How do we do this layout when it's on desktop like this.

02:23:19
<transcript>: because

02:23:22
<transcript>: Because it only cuts to that when it goes to small.

02:23:22
<transcript>: i don't think

02:23:24
<transcript>: I don't think it should be medium. Actually.

02:23:30
<transcript>: I think all of my small styles could just change to so s.

02:23:33
<transcript>: Small.

02:23:40
<transcript>: Do I need to escape? That.

02:23:40
<transcript>: wait

02:23:43
<transcript>: Wait percent? S.

02:23:45
<transcript>: And then.

02:23:45
<transcript>: small

02:23:46
<transcript>: Small.

02:23:46
<transcript>: at

02:23:49
<transcript>: At replace with.

02:23:49
<transcript>: medium

02:23:50
<transcript>: Medium.

02:23:53
<transcript>: Like that.

02:23:56
<transcript>: Okay.

02:23:56
<transcript>: i didn't

02:24:01
<transcript>: I didn't prove things yet, but there I think that's better.

02:24:03
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:24:03
<transcript>: i just need to make

02:24:04
<transcript>: I just need to make.

02:24:04
<transcript>: two rows

02:24:07
<transcript>: Two rows of two. In this case.

02:24:10
stroopwafel26: this is now a frontend stream

02:24:12
<transcript>: It just needs to stay stacked like that until it gets really big.

02:24:16
<transcript>: Tailwind giving headache.

02:24:16
<transcript>: just

02:24:18
<transcript>: Just front end.

02:24:18
<transcript>: design

02:24:25
<transcript>: Design giving me headaches, I guess let's build some. Let's just kind of step away from the design a little bit and start building.

02:24:25
<transcript>: how do i not turn

02:24:26
<transcript>: How do I not turn on music.

02:24:32
<transcript>: You are hearing my music, right? I don't even know if the Loops thing needs to be running.

02:24:35
<transcript>: I don't know. Do you all hear music when I play it.

02:24:37
<transcript>: Here on that.

02:24:37
<transcript>: anybody

02:24:39
<transcript>: Anybody.

02:24:39
<transcript>: bueller

02:24:40
<transcript>: Bueller.

02:24:41
catmodev: no music

02:24:43
<transcript>: Let me know if you don't.

02:24:46
<transcript>: Know music? I.

02:24:46
mhuggins7278: yes it just started

02:24:54
<transcript>: Just started. Oh, somebody hears it in the Huggins. Here's. It.

02:24:57
<transcript>: Okay.

02:25:01
<transcript>: It's very quiet right now. Probably.

02:25:01
<transcript>: now it's less

02:25:02
<transcript>: Now it's less quiet.

02:25:06
stroopwafel26: alt-J  is always good

02:25:13
<transcript>: So let's make the actual functionality of the game better. So let's view it on mobile.

02:25:14
catmodev: yes..working

02:25:19
<transcript>: So you get presented with this image, you gotta guess what is the service.

02:25:24
<transcript>: When you click on service we've got that all working with the game router.

02:25:28
<transcript>: So you can answer.

02:25:30
<transcript>: And we return.

02:25:30
<transcript>: correct

02:25:39
<transcript>: Correct and the next round if there is if you're correct or we just return correct, false and no next round if there's not an extra round.

02:25:39
<transcript>: right

02:25:40
<transcript>: Right.

02:25:44
<transcript>: Okay. So that all looks good.

02:25:50
<transcript>: Now we need to have let's see.

02:25:50
<transcript>: when it's

02:25:51
<transcript>: When it's.

02:25:51
<transcript>: when it's wrong

02:25:56
<transcript>: When it's wrong, when you get the wrong answer right now what happens.

02:26:02
<transcript>: Current Round. So here we go.

02:26:07
stroopwafel26: I've never in my life seen this service icon :')

02:26:08
<transcript>: Re familiarizing myself.

02:26:10
<transcript>: Let's crack. We do that.

02:26:10
<transcript>: if it

02:26:14
<transcript>: If it's wrong, we just log the console. That's not gonna work.

02:26:22
stroopwafel26: granted i know just about 0 service icons lmao

02:26:23
<transcript>: Yeah. This is the service I am not familiar with. There's a lot of them.

02:26:24
<transcript>: There's a lot of services.

02:26:24
<transcript>: it might be

02:26:26
<transcript>: It might be.

02:26:28
<transcript>: Comprehend medical.

02:26:35
<transcript>: I guess. Yeah. It's a little medical symbol. So you can kind of guess, right. This one's the like.

02:26:48
<transcript>: Okay.

02:26:51
<transcript>: So when you get one wrong.

02:26:51
<transcript>: we want to

02:26:53
<transcript>: We want to do something.

02:26:57
<transcript>: To show you that was wrong.

02:27:04
<transcript>: I guess if you get it wrong do we go to the next one is well.

02:27:12
<transcript>: I guess we do.

02:27:20
<transcript>: Create a new round either way.

02:27:35
<transcript>: So.

02:27:41
<transcript>: I'll give you a new round.

02:27:44
<transcript>: We just tell you whether you got it right or wrong.

02:27:47
<transcript>: Visually. Right.

02:27:49
<transcript>: Okay.

02:27:50
<transcript>: So up here.

02:27:55
<transcript>: We always do this.

02:28:04
<transcript>: Now, we just need to figure out how do we visually indicate that you got it right. We can do a big green.

02:28:18
<transcript>: When you click one while it's answering, we need to make sure you can't click another.

02:28:18
<transcript>: another

02:28:20
<transcript>: Another thing we need to do.

02:28:23
<transcript>: So handle answer.

02:28:27
<transcript>: We've got these mutations. Do they have like a Loading state on them.

02:28:31
<transcript>: If answer mutation.

02:28:34
<transcript>: Is.

02:28:34
<transcript>: busy

02:28:35
<transcript>: Busy.

02:28:37
<transcript>: What do we have here.

02:28:40
<transcript>: Is idle.

02:28:43
<transcript>: Is Loading.

02:28:48
<transcript>: We can say status.

02:28:53
<transcript>: Idle error, Loading or success.

02:28:53
<transcript>: so if it's

02:28:55
<transcript>: So if it's not idle.

02:28:57
<transcript>: Now let's just say.

02:28:57
<transcript>: if answer

02:29:00
<transcript>: If answering mutation.

02:29:02
<transcript>: Is.

02:29:05
<transcript>: Loading.

02:29:10
<transcript>: Then we need to return. Right.

02:29:23
<transcript>: We need to probably disable the button too like just to save all the buttons if let's see.

02:29:26
<transcript>: Here. We're going to say, disabled.

02:29:26
<transcript>: equals

02:29:27
<transcript>: Equals.

02:29:31
<transcript>: Answer mutation.

02:29:34
<transcript>: That is.

02:29:38
<transcript>: Loading.

02:29:42
<transcript>: Why can't answer me? Oh, because this is the round.

02:29:50
<transcript>: Okay. We're gonna have let's just do this. Let's do type round props.

02:29:54
<transcript>: That we're round.

02:29:58
<transcript>: We're gonna have a on answer.

02:29:58
<transcript>: choice

02:29:59
<transcript>: Choice.

02:30:05
<transcript>: String void. Okay. And then we're gonna have a.

02:30:09
<transcript>: Disabled.

02:30:14
<transcript>: For busy? No. Do we want that on around.

02:30:22
<transcript>: Busy Loading.

02:30:22
<transcript>: loading

02:30:23
<transcript>: Loading.

02:30:26
<transcript>: What do we call this.

02:30:39
<transcript>: Busy.

02:30:44
<transcript>: Loading.

02:30:47
<transcript>: We're just disabled. We'll just have a disabled on it.

02:30:51
<transcript>: This will be.

02:30:55
<transcript>: I want to replace inside the.

02:30:55
<transcript>: bra

02:31:00
<transcript>: Bracket? So I'm gonna do, but there's a bracket there.

02:31:00
<transcript>: but yeah

02:31:02
<transcript>: But yeah, inside.

02:31:02
<transcript>: let's

02:31:05
<transcript>: Let's just delete inside those.

02:31:09
<transcript>: And then do round props.

02:31:12
<transcript>: Disabled.

02:31:15
<transcript>: And then here.

02:31:17
<transcript>: Now.

02:31:28
<transcript>: Should have done. C. That's okay. Disabled. Okay. So we're disabled if disabled. And then here I need to say.

02:31:35
<transcript>: If the sabled.

02:31:42
<transcript>: Has some styling changes, right.

02:31:45
<transcript>: Or I could just said, disabled.

02:31:45
<transcript>: yeah they have

02:31:49
<transcript>: Yeah, they have that already. Okay. Disabled.

02:31:51
<transcript>: Opacity.

02:31:51
<transcript>: fifty

02:31:54
<transcript>: 50 or something. I don't know.

02:32:00
<transcript>: I can remove this.

02:32:06
<transcript>: I'll just get picked up by the props, okay.

02:32:06
<transcript>: dis

02:32:09
<transcript>: Disable Disable. See.

02:32:09
<transcript>: now

02:32:12
<transcript>: Now we disabled a Buttons win.

02:32:14
<transcript>: We're pending.

02:32:14
<transcript>: so up here

02:32:17
<transcript>: So up here we have to pass in.

02:32:21
<transcript>: Table equals.

02:32:23
<transcript>: Answer mutation.

02:32:25
<transcript>: Is Loading.

02:32:31
<transcript>: So if it's Loading, we disable all the buttons. That's all we're just doing right there.

02:32:38
<transcript>: And then we check here, too. If it's Loading, we return. So now you should be able to answer twice. Right.

02:32:41
<transcript>: If I say console Mobile application.

02:32:41
<transcript>: it goes

02:32:48
<transcript>: It goes disabled and then it goes in a new round. Okay Cloud HSM the disabled state looked really bad.

02:32:53
<transcript>: I did opacity. It's probably not the right move.

02:32:53
<transcript>: let's

02:32:55
<transcript>: Let's do something else.

02:33:01
<transcript>: Disabled we're gonna make the maybe the border.

02:33:03
<transcript>: Order.

02:33:03
<transcript>: orange

02:33:04
<transcript>: Orange.

02:33:08
<transcript>: Eight.

02:33:09
<transcript>: And.

02:33:09
<transcript>: text

02:33:13
<transcript>: Text Orange. Eight. I don't know.

02:33:15
<transcript>: After.

02:33:20
<transcript>: Background Orange. Eight. Like that.

02:33:22
<transcript>: Oh, they disabled right now.

02:33:30
<transcript>: That should be disabled. Both of these should disabled.

02:33:34
<transcript>: Disabled.

02:33:38
<transcript>: Let's actually disable it so we can test.

02:33:47
<transcript>: Interesting.

02:33:49
<transcript>: Equals true.

02:33:52
<transcript>: Let's get overridden.

02:33:56
<transcript>: Here we go.

02:34:01
<transcript>: So there was another something else here that.

02:34:01
<transcript>: the

02:34:05
<transcript>: The Amazon and AWS are not getting styled appropriately.

02:34:08
<transcript>: So let's do this.

02:34:11
<transcript>: Let's take out the text Orange line that was.

02:34:11
<transcript>: a mistake

02:34:16
<transcript>: A mistake. There we go. Okay, so that's the disabled state. That looks pretty good.

02:34:18
stroopwafel26: AWS Marketplace_dark should be renamed

02:34:27
<transcript>: Okay, so now if I do cloud search, what is this icon? It's like Black and White. Looks like a Cart marketplace. Probably.

02:34:34
<transcript>: So it goes like I can't click them twice. Oh, wow, it's fast. Look how fast it is. Iot core.

02:34:38
<transcript>: Comprehend. Medical. Okay. It's working.

02:34:38
<transcript>: we just need

02:34:44
<transcript>: We just need to signify that you got it right. You know, I'm saying so I think we're not doing right now.

02:34:46
<transcript>: Yeah. Street. We got to remove that dark.

02:34:46
<transcript>: underscore

02:34:48
<transcript>: Underscore dark thing.

02:34:51
<transcript>: Definitely need to do that.

02:35:02
<transcript>: Okay, IQ should be capitalized.

02:35:08
<transcript>: What's this one look like.

02:35:08
<transcript>: element

02:35:11
<transcript>: Elemental Media live.

02:35:13
<transcript>: Probably.

02:35:13
<transcript>: okay let's

02:35:18
<transcript>: Okay, let's get the you did it right versus you did it wrong. So we just did a toast.

02:35:23
<transcript>: No, we should definitely like.

02:35:23
<transcript>: color

02:35:26
<transcript>: Color. It green or red. Right.

02:35:26
<transcript>: let's do

02:35:29
<transcript>: Let's do that. So.

02:35:38
<transcript>: We up here where we store the last question was correct or incorrect.

02:35:47
stroopwafel26: kid woke up, it's thursday so we're going to the library, have a nice day :)

02:35:47
<transcript>: So.

02:35:49
<transcript>: Correct.

02:35:58
<transcript>: Okay.

02:36:01
<transcript>: So here we're just going to set.

02:36:05
<transcript>: Correct to response, correct.

02:36:09
<transcript>: And then.

02:36:17
<transcript>: Let's see and then set current round round that's actually gonna be on like a timer.

02:36:21
<transcript>: So we're gonna set correct. And then we're gonna set timeout.

02:36:26
<transcript>: Like this.

02:36:34
<transcript>: 500 milliseconds.

02:36:47
<transcript>: Milliseconds later we set the the current round. So we show this correct say for just a SEC.

02:36:55
<transcript>: But we also need a way to signify.

02:37:00
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow Dianbo. We also know.

02:37:00
<transcript>: and also never

02:37:06
<transcript>: And also never back down and Conf I missed your your follows. Thank you for the following.

02:37:12
<transcript>: I'll see a Stroop. Enjoy the library. I love taking mix at the library. It's like my favorite place to go.

02:37:18
<transcript>: Thanks for coming. Thanks for coming, Stroop.

02:37:21
<transcript>: Set timeout.

02:37:27
<transcript>: We also need to do like this, I guess.

02:37:27
<transcript>: need

02:37:31
<transcript>: Need a way to signify. Well, no, it's just that.

02:37:34
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:37:34
<transcript>: this needs

02:37:37
<transcript>: This needs to be able to be undefined as well.

02:37:43
<transcript>: So if it's not if it's.

02:37:43
<transcript>: false

02:37:47
<transcript>: False. There's a difference in false. And then find here if it's false.

02:37:50
<transcript>: Okay, we're gonna have to add.

02:37:52
<transcript>: Correct.

02:37:58
<transcript>: So round, props. Now.

02:38:02
<transcript>: Okay.

02:38:07
<transcript>: Let's do this.

02:38:15
<transcript>: So it's correct. We're gonna do some different things. We're gonna style it differently.

02:38:19
<transcript>: Like right here.

02:38:25
<transcript>: Like that.

02:38:35
<transcript>: Needs to be an object as well.

02:38:41
<transcript>: Okay.

02:38:41
<transcript>: we're gonna

02:38:43
umar_codes: Couldn’t you cast undefined to a Boolean with !!

02:38:43
<transcript>: We're gonna add some styles.

02:38:45
<transcript>: Win cross.

02:38:47
<transcript>: So.

02:38:49
<transcript>: Border.

02:38:51
<transcript>: Green.

02:38:51
<transcript>: up

02:38:54
<transcript>: Up Ad Green as well. Gordon Border Green, 500.

02:38:57
<transcript>: After.

02:38:59
<transcript>: Background.

02:38:59
<transcript>: green

02:39:02
<transcript>: Green 500.

02:39:06
<transcript>: And Text green, 500.

02:39:06
<transcript>: right

02:39:08
<transcript>: Right.

02:39:08
<transcript>: and all of

02:39:12
<transcript>: And all of this is if it's correct if correct equals true.

02:39:12
<transcript>: i'm gonna be really

02:39:15
<transcript>: I'm gonna be really explicit on this because correct.

02:39:15
<transcript>: could equal

02:39:17
<transcript>: Could equal false.

02:39:25
<transcript>: False.

02:39:29
<transcript>: Okay.

02:39:40
<transcript>: So we're gonna do red.

02:39:55
<transcript>: Gift.

02:39:55
<transcript>: is false

02:39:56
<transcript>: Is false. Right.

02:40:01
<transcript>: Boolean is not defined.

02:40:03
<transcript>: Sorry? What.

02:40:09
<transcript>: 's not where you put that.

02:40:11
<transcript>: Okay.

02:40:11
<transcript>: now it's correct

02:40:17
<transcript>: Now it's correct. We should have Green. If not correct, we should have the red border.

02:40:17
<transcript>: let's try

02:40:18
<transcript>: Let's try.

02:40:24
<transcript>: So let's see, what is that thing? It is not code. Viewer. Right.

02:40:29
<transcript>: Oh, wait a minute. Did it make all the other ones? Let's delay. Let's change that 500.

02:40:31
<transcript>: Oh.

02:40:34
<transcript>: Set timeout.

02:40:34
<transcript>: yeah

02:40:36
<transcript>: Yeah. Let's change this to be like.

02:40:43
<transcript>: 5000. So we're gonna reverse more sells more time here to see it happen.

02:40:43
<transcript>: so that

02:40:45
<transcript>: So that is.

02:40:45
<transcript>: augmented

02:40:48
<transcript>: Augmented AI a two. I think.

02:40:48
<transcript>: but

02:40:54
<transcript>: But we're gonna guess translate. Okay. So they all turned red. Except for the one.

02:40:54
<transcript>: because

02:40:56
<transcript>: Because it's hovered.

02:40:56
laytanl_: Looking good!

02:41:01
<transcript>: I just want the one to turn red.

02:41:01
<transcript>: that's the actual

02:41:04
<transcript>: That's the actual guess. So how do I do that.

02:41:10
<transcript>: Correct.

02:41:14
<transcript>: How about.

02:41:17
<transcript>: Looking good.

02:41:17
<transcript>: couldn't

02:41:24
<transcript>: Couldn't you cast welcome to Chad, Umar. Couldn't you cast undefined to a boolean with that.

02:41:35
<transcript>: Yes. Could you cast unfine to a boolean with that. But I don't want I want undefined to not apply any of these files so I could do this. I could say if correct.

02:41:42
<transcript>: That is fine. I just need to explicitly say here correct is false.

02:41:44
<transcript>: Right.

02:41:45
lick_it_clean: !stack

02:41:47
<transcript>: Guess I could have done.

02:41:47
<transcript>: no yeah

02:41:49
<transcript>: No. Yeah. That's what I need to do.

02:41:56
<transcript>: And then correct undefined will apply neither of these, but I only need to do this for the button.

02:41:56
<transcript>: where

02:42:01
<transcript>: Where it was the choice. So we need to like, track the last.

02:42:05
<transcript>: Let's see. Correct. Could not be a boolean. It could be like a choice.

02:42:05
<transcript>: let's see

02:42:07
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:42:07
<transcript>: when you click

02:42:11
<transcript>: When you click on one do we just store the state in this round.

02:42:11
<transcript>: of like the previous

02:42:14
<transcript>: Of like the previously answered thing.

02:42:16
<transcript>: That's the way to do it.

02:42:24
<transcript>: Before we just passed it back in as props. Let's just do that.

02:42:26
<transcript>: Toy.

02:42:27
laytanl_: @lick_it_clean https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app

02:42:28
<transcript>: That is a string.

02:42:35
<transcript>: Sometimes.

02:42:35
<transcript>: the them

02:42:36
<transcript>: The them is not with me.

02:42:36
lick_it_clean: @laytanl_ <3 cheers

02:42:38
umar_codes: Maybe save the correct item id in state instead?

02:42:47
<transcript>: All right. So choice could be passed back in. Let's do that up here.

02:42:50
<transcript>: Choice.

02:42:50
<transcript>: equals

02:42:51
<transcript>: Equals.

02:42:55
<transcript>: Not probably.

02:42:57
<transcript>: Handle, answer.

02:43:00
<transcript>: We need to set choice.

02:43:02
<transcript>: And actually store it.

02:43:17
<transcript>: Here.

02:43:25
<transcript>: Is this the best way to do this? We're gonna run with it.

02:43:25
<transcript>: set

02:43:38
<transcript>: Set correct response correct. And then after a timeout we set correct undefined and current round moves on to the next round. We're also going to obviously start keeping track of score. We're going to store that on the game object. Start doing that in a minute.

02:43:42
<transcript>: So we pass choice back in to round and now.

02:43:42
<transcript>: here

02:43:44
<transcript>: Here.

02:43:50
<transcript>: 's A difference, right? There's a different.

02:44:01
<transcript>: Like this way. I.

02:44:01
<transcript>: couldn't

02:44:03
<transcript>: Couldn't just do this.

02:44:03
<transcript>: yeah

02:44:04
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:44:06
<transcript>: That's what I wanted.

02:44:15
<transcript>: So if the choice is passed in now we know only the button where choice? Like right here. Let's see. Oh, I have two choices.

02:44:17
<transcript>: Two choices.

02:44:17
<transcript>: this should be

02:44:20
<transcript>: This should be named something else.

02:44:21
<transcript>: We'll just name this.

02:44:21
<transcript>: c

02:44:23
<transcript>: C.

02:44:25
<transcript>: Yes.

02:44:25
<transcript>: like

02:44:30
<transcript>: Like having that BC. But I need to not conflict with.

02:44:30
<transcript>: so

02:44:33
<transcript>: So here it's going to be correct.

02:44:33
<transcript>: and

02:44:35
<transcript>: And.

02:44:37
<transcript>: Choice.

02:44:37
<transcript>: equ

02:44:42
<transcript>: Equals CNAME, and then here same thing.

02:44:47
<transcript>: And choice equals C. That name.

02:44:47
<transcript>: we track

02:44:50
<transcript>: We trackin Does this all make sense.

02:44:55
<transcript>: Save the correct item ID and state instead.

02:45:00
<transcript>: I don't know. The correct item ID actually on the client, right.

02:45:00
<transcript>: i don't think i actually

02:45:04
<transcript>: I don't think I actually know the correct client ID. I just know that mine was incorrect.

02:45:04
<transcript>: oh

02:45:12
<transcript>: Oh, but I should tell them. Yeah, we should tell them which one is correct so we can show them the correct answer. Oh, of course, of course.

02:45:33
<transcript>: So we're gonna say.

02:45:38
lick_it_clean: ma man smoking on that pack EZ

02:45:42
<transcript>: Provide the answer.

02:46:23
<transcript>: Okay.

02:46:29
<transcript>: Back to the front end. So now we get back.

02:46:33
<transcript>: Here. Let's see.

02:46:37
<transcript>: In this response. Now we have the.

02:46:37
<transcript>: the actual

02:46:40
<transcript>: The actual correct answer.

02:46:46
<transcript>: So instead of storing this as a boolean.

02:46:49
<transcript>: Change this to be answer.

02:47:05
<transcript>: The answer is going to be a straight.

02:47:13
<transcript>: Okay.

02:47:14
lick_it_clean: where can i find your dot files?

02:47:16
<transcript>: Set, answer.

02:47:21
<transcript>: Oh, you know what? Maybe we still want to have, like, a boolean.

02:47:25
<transcript>: Maybe we still want to have.

02:47:29
<transcript>: Correct. And we're just gonna also have answer.

02:47:29
<transcript>: seems like

02:47:32
<transcript>: Seems like a lot I feel like there's a simpler way.

02:47:35
<transcript>: Do all this thing management but.

02:47:44
<transcript>: We're gonna roll with it keep it easy for now.

02:47:53
lick_it_clean: @BarneyOfTheRubble <3

02:47:55
<transcript>: We set answer to response, answer.

02:48:07
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow Seawald. I appreciate your policy, Walt. Welcome.

02:48:15
<transcript>: Well, maybe not welcome. Maybe we've been here a while. Maybe. Maybe just decided that was enough. You've seen enough? You're gonna follow now.

02:48:18
<transcript>: I appreciate it.

02:48:22
<transcript>: The stack. Lick it Clean is the T three stack.

02:48:24
<transcript>: Oh, lightning.

02:48:29
<transcript>: Why I should read more than one message before I respond.

02:48:34
<transcript>: A man smoking on that pack. I had to deal with it. Thing on.

02:48:40
<transcript>: I think singularity, hey, Oh.

02:48:40
<transcript>: happy

02:48:43
<transcript>: Happy Thursday, finite. How are you doing.

02:48:51
<transcript>: Work connected on Twitter. Now I like making friends on Twitch and then carrying it over to Twitter and vice versa. Versa. Ice.

02:48:51
<transcript>: that's

02:48:52
finitesingularity: Waking up.. :D

02:48:56
<transcript>: That's sounds like you had a good stream yesterday. I love those feelings. Finite. When.

02:49:02
<transcript>: Somehow on stream like everything comes together and you finish the stream with like.

02:49:02
<transcript>: some kind of

02:49:08
finitesingularity: Yeah, its great!  I am new to the whole tweeting thing. LUL

02:49:18
finitesingularity: Yes.. it was fantastic.. it feels soooo good.

02:49:22
<transcript>: Some kind of closure. Like, you got a thing working. You were refactoring yesterday and you got it all working. I love that feeling. It happens occasionally. We're like, there's a story on your stream. There's a beginning, middle and end, and it ends with this nice, fuzzy feeling. I love when it happens on a Friday, just generally with work, when you like, nail something at the end of a Friday, and then you go into the weekend, you're just floating on the clouds.

02:49:22
<transcript>: love it

02:49:24
<transcript>: Love it love that feeling.

02:49:27
<transcript>: Feel so good.

02:49:34
<transcript>: New to the whole Tweeting thing. Yeah. Twitter's kind of the worst. You're not missing anything, to be honest.

02:49:34
<transcript>: it's just

02:49:36
<transcript>: It's just a lot of grift.

02:49:38
<transcript>: A lot of stuff.

02:49:38
<transcript>: a lot of negative

02:49:40
<transcript>: A lot of negative stuff. I'm not a fan of.

02:49:42
<transcript>: Okay.

02:49:42
<transcript>: so we have

02:49:44
laytanl_: I loved the stream where it ended without sound haha, the exact opposite

02:49:46
<transcript>: So we have the correct answer. We have.

02:49:46
<transcript>: wait

02:49:53
<transcript>: Wait, what's the difference? Correct. Oh, that's like boolean. And this is the actual answer. So now we can pass that down.

02:49:53
<transcript>: let's see

02:49:54
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:49:57
catmodev: need to make some deploys, cheers, awesome stream

02:50:02
<transcript>: This all feels really dirty. This is where it starts feeling really dirty, right.

02:50:05
<transcript>: When I'm like setting things undefined.

02:50:05
<transcript>: doing

02:50:07
<transcript>: Doing all this.

02:50:13
<transcript>: But we're gonna pass the answer down as well.

02:50:14
finitesingularity: Gotta be a positive bastion in the dark places then I guess.. :D

02:50:17
<transcript>: What's the correct answer, right.

02:50:17
<transcript>: not to be confus

02:50:20
<transcript>: Not to be confused with correct, which is a boolean.

02:50:24
<transcript>: Answer. Okay.

02:50:26
shambor7: Just remember, no deploying to production on Friday ;)

02:50:29
<transcript>: So we have choice, answer and correct you could do.

02:50:29
<transcript>: correct

02:50:33
<transcript>: Correct from does the choice equal the answer.

02:50:33
<transcript>: that

02:50:39
<transcript>: That would be one simplification we could make but I'm going to leave it like this.

02:50:39
<transcript>: ants

02:50:41
<transcript>: Ants were.

02:50:46
<transcript>: W an answer somebody tell me that tell me that.

02:50:50
<transcript>: Need to make some deploys tears. See ya, Katmo. Thank you so much.

02:50:50
<transcript>: had fun

02:50:56
<transcript>: Had fun. Enjoyed you being here. I love the stream where it ended without sound.

02:50:56
<transcript>: cheese

02:51:01
<transcript>: Cheese latent. That was the absolute opposite. That stream. I ended.

02:51:01
<transcript>: you guys

02:51:15
<transcript>: You guys couldn't hear me. I was talking to myself. Everything was broken. My overlays were completely hosed. I was late. My wife was upset because I wasn't upstairs. And I should have been. And I'd pee. It was like everything that could go wrong at the end of a stream went wrong on that one.

02:51:15
<transcript>: that was good

02:51:20
<transcript>: That was good times. We'll go back and look at that VOD sometime. That was fun.

02:51:20
<transcript>: notable in production

02:51:25
<transcript>: Notable in production on Friday. Welcome to Chat Shambore. That's right.

02:51:25
<transcript>: no

02:51:27
<transcript>: No. Deploying.

02:51:27
<transcript>: xenon

02:51:31
<transcript>: Xenon Friday I just don't ever deploy to production. That's my secret.

02:51:35
<transcript>: I just only build stuff that I play with locally.

02:51:35
<transcript>: it's mostly true

02:51:36
<transcript>: It's mostly true.

02:51:36
<transcript>: sounds like i

02:51:38
<transcript>: Sounds like I'm joking, but.

02:51:40
<transcript>: Okay.

02:51:43
<transcript>: You have the answer now so we can say.

02:51:43
<transcript>: it's

02:51:46
<transcript>: It's a choice is easy.

02:51:49
<transcript>: Then we're doing that styling.

02:51:54
<transcript>: If the choice is equal to or I'm sorry if the name is equal to the answer.

02:51:54
<transcript>: okay let's think about

02:51:56
<transcript>: Okay. Let's think about this.

02:51:59
<transcript>: So.

02:51:59
<transcript>: when you

02:52:03
<transcript>: When you guess we want to style the one that you clicked on.

02:52:03
umar_codes: Could you get away with only saving the correct answer. And in then your conditional class logic. Compare the choice against the correct answer. If it’s true apply your classes. That way you only need to keep track of one data point instead of 3

02:52:07
<transcript>: To be Green if you were correct.

02:52:16
<transcript>: And if you were incorrect, there's like a way, simpler way to do this, I think. But like if you're incorrect, we want to show.

02:52:16
<transcript>: the one you click

02:52:19
umar_codes: And then*

02:52:23
<transcript>: The one you clicked on as incorrect. Red. We'll put like an emoji on it or something. We want to show the one that was correct.

02:52:23
<transcript>: lit up

02:52:26
<transcript>: Lit up green like you should have clicked this one right.

02:52:26
<transcript>: so that

02:52:29
<transcript>: So that's what we're trying to do.

02:52:31
<transcript>: Then this green color.

02:52:31
<transcript>: is going

02:52:38
<transcript>: Is going to be either when correct and choice is equal to the name or okay, hear me out.

02:52:38
<transcript>: so put all this

02:52:40
<transcript>: So put all this.

02:52:40
<transcript>: in

02:52:42
<transcript>: In parense.

02:52:42
<transcript>: right

02:52:43
<transcript>: Right.

02:52:45
<transcript>: Like that or.

02:52:52
<transcript>: When incorrect or when correct equals false. Not to be confused with.

02:52:52
<transcript>: unfine

02:52:55
<transcript>: Unfine but when correct equals false.

02:52:55
<transcript>: and

02:52:56
<transcript>: And.

02:52:56
<transcript>: answer

02:52:58
<transcript>: Answer.

02:53:01
<transcript>: Equals C name right.

02:53:06
<transcript>: Okay. And then down here it goes. Red.

02:53:14
caldotjs: hello guys :)

02:53:22
<transcript>: And only one case, right? Yeah. That's still right. If correct is false and choice is equals to your name. Okay. I think this is right. So now if I guess wrong, let's just guess wrong here. What do we think that? Is that's something with like, Clayak CloudWAN? So let's guess code star.

02:53:26
<transcript>: Wrong. Oh, it didn't turn red. I think it's because it's hovered.

02:53:26
<transcript>: yeah see there's

02:53:32
<transcript>: Yeah. See there's. Okay. So we need to fix that when it's on Hover, we need to clear the Hover styles.

02:53:32
<transcript>: and that

02:53:35
<transcript>: And that in that state.

02:53:35
<transcript>: let's see

02:53:36
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:53:40
<transcript>: All the Hover styles are all defined. Well, we can just do this.

02:53:44
<transcript>: Hover.

02:53:49
<transcript>: None.

02:53:51
<transcript>: Border.

02:53:56
<transcript>: That's annoying. I'm just gonna have to duplicate all the Hover stuff.

02:54:07
<transcript>: I guess I am Hoarder Hover border green.

02:54:07
<transcript>: can you like a sa

02:54:11
<transcript>: Can you like a Sable Hover? How do you disable Hover.

02:54:17
<transcript>: How could I do that.

02:54:21
<transcript>: Tailwind. You know I'm saying like I want to remove the Hover styles.

02:54:23
<transcript>: Tailwind.

02:54:29
<transcript>: Remove Hover Styles thank you so much for the follow raw.

02:54:29
<transcript>: all peace

02:54:32
<transcript>: All. Peace. Hello, Caldot's. Here.

02:54:47
<transcript>: Could you get away with only saving the correct answer? And then in your conditional class logic, compare the choice against the correct answer if it's true, apply a classes. That way, you only need to keep track of one data point instead of three.

02:54:49
<transcript>: Yes.

02:54:52
caldotjs: how your day going so far? are we making progress?

02:54:53
<transcript>: I think you're right. So if we just had the correct answer.

02:54:53
<transcript>: yeah

02:54:56
<transcript>: Yeah, yeah, that's way better.

02:54:59
<transcript>: Yeah, that's way better. How did a.

02:55:05
<transcript>: Like I want to remove the Hover stuff.

02:55:11
raulp: hey. how are u doing? whats going on here ?

02:55:22
<transcript>: I just really want to make it where you can't Hover it right if it's been selected, if they answer has been selected, there's no more Hover stitch. How do I turn them off.

02:55:26
<transcript>: Here. I Invalid.

02:55:32
<transcript>: You may know what I'm trying to do.

02:55:37
<transcript>: There's like an ugly way to do this. I'm just trying to avoid it.

02:55:40
<transcript>: The ugly way would be to just copy all the styles.

02:55:45
mhzrerfani: custom class?

02:55:45
<transcript>: But I don't want to do that.

02:55:55
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow OOH. Omar.

02:56:03
<transcript>: Yeah, we're gonna do that. Omar. We're gonna simplify things. Hey, Raw, welcome to Chat. How are you doing? What's going on here? We're building.

02:56:03
<transcript>: a game called

02:56:04
<transcript>: A game called.

02:56:13
<transcript>: Aw, guess it's like you see an AWS service icon. You have to guess what it is. So like, what is that thing that is.

02:56:18
<transcript>: Waitlinks. Yeah. Okay. So we're going to remove the Hover States.

02:56:18
<transcript>: when

02:56:20
<transcript>: When we click on one.

02:56:22
barneyoftherubble: Is tailwind on devdocs.io?

02:56:25
<transcript>: That's the thing we're trying to accomplish. Thank you for the follow all.

02:56:27
<transcript>: Jr.

02:56:27
<transcript>: is

02:56:33
<transcript>: Is tailwind on Dev Docs IO. I don't even know what till what Dev Docs IO is.

02:56:36
<transcript>: Disable transform transition on Hover.

02:56:45
<transcript>: Enabled modifier.

02:56:47
caldotjs: @BarneyOfTheRubble https://devdocs.io/tailwindcss/

02:56:48
jass2k: Can't you just check if answer has been clicked in a template string. If so not render hover?

02:56:52
<transcript>: I guess. Do we want them to be disabled.

02:56:52
<transcript>: pointer of

02:56:54
<transcript>: Pointer of Inst.

02:56:58
<transcript>: instance

02:57:00
<transcript>: Instance none.

02:57:02
<transcript>: We could do that.

02:57:05
<transcript>: Pointer.

02:57:09
<transcript>: Pointer. Events? None.

02:57:13
<transcript>: Now, that should work. Right.

02:57:13
<transcript>: have an elegant

02:57:16
<transcript>: Have an elegant solution. Kind of like that.

02:57:17
barneyoftherubble: Try that link @adamdotdev it’s a great site

02:57:21
<transcript>: Planer events, pointer, events.

02:57:21
<transcript>: none

02:57:22
caldotjs: @BarneyOfTheRubble it has a search function :>

02:57:23
<transcript>: None.

02:57:26
raulp: cool. currently on the way to solutions architect certification myself. coincidence 😛 i guess

02:57:26
<transcript>: There you go.

02:57:26
<transcript>: okay

02:57:27
umar_codes: Pointer events would be the only css way of doing it

02:57:28
<transcript>: Okay. Let's try that.

02:57:31
<transcript>: Is this app config now.

02:57:31
<transcript>: still not

02:57:36
<transcript>: Still not working. Still hovering. It's not even Hover. It's like selected state or something.

02:57:38
umar_codes: But then you lose clicking?

02:57:39
<transcript>: What is that.

02:57:39
<transcript>: direct

02:57:41
<transcript>: Direct connect.

02:57:41
<transcript>: yeah

02:57:42
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:57:50
<transcript>: Winter vins would be the only CSS way of doing it.

02:57:50
<transcript>: okay

02:57:51
<transcript>: Okay.

02:58:00
<transcript>: Hey Roller studying for your solutions ArcadeX hopefully this will be helpful. Try that link. It's a great site. Dev Docs IO.

02:58:00
<transcript>: what is

02:58:02
<transcript>: What is this.

02:58:02
umar_codes: And all other pointer events

02:58:10
<transcript>: Jazz can't you just check if answer has been clicked in a template string? If so, not render Hover.

02:58:10
<transcript>: yeah

02:58:17
<transcript>: Yeah. So I guess I was doing this. What is this? It's just takes all people stocks and puts them on one site.

02:58:21
<transcript>: Set the idea.

02:58:21
<transcript>: have

02:58:22
<transcript>: Have.

02:58:24
mhzrerfani: i think we can put all hover classes in a class and switch based on state

02:58:32
<transcript>: You.

02:58:39
<transcript>: I think I just need to think about this a little differently.

02:58:43
<transcript>: Let's simplify. What.

02:58:43
<transcript>: 's just only

02:58:47
<transcript>: 's just only passing the answer like we were talking about here. So choice.

02:58:51
<transcript>: We don't need we don't need correct, right.

02:59:01
<transcript>: Up here, we can remove choice incorrect. So we just pass the answer in. We no longer have to set correct.

02:59:05
<transcript>: We just set the answer. We don't have to set the choice.

02:59:05
<transcript>: okay

02:59:06
<transcript>: Okay.

02:59:06
<transcript>: well we

02:59:11
<transcript>: Well, we still need to know the choice, right? Because we need to know which one they clicked on.

02:59:13
<transcript>: Still need to know that.

02:59:17
raulp: thats the real developer tabs right there. ram is ready to jump from clo

02:59:18
<transcript>: We don't need to store the correct boolean. We can drive that.

02:59:20
<transcript>: I think we still need the choice.

02:59:23
raulp: a cliff

02:59:24
<transcript>: Otherwise we don't know which one they clicked on.

02:59:27
<transcript>: But we don't need correct.

02:59:27
<transcript>: correctly

02:59:29
<transcript>: Correctly if I'm wrong.

02:59:29
<transcript>: that could be wrong

02:59:32
<transcript>: That could be wrong. Correct me if I'm wrong please.

02:59:37
<transcript>: Has a search function. I saw that.

02:59:49
<transcript>: I think we can put all Hover classes in a class and switch based on state. Yeah, I think I just need to be aware of that in the button I was trying to. I've mixed up my styles here across.

02:59:53
<transcript>: A couple things. Thanks for the follow X knee. Hello.

02:59:53
<transcript>: nikilo

02:59:55
<transcript>: Nikilo.

02:59:58
umar_codes: Do we need the choice as we already have all the choices on the page

03:00:02
<transcript>: Let me show you what I mean? So answer and choice? I think I still need answer and choice? I don't need correct.

03:00:05
<transcript>: But right now I've got this button.

03:00:05
<transcript>: just style

03:00:09
<transcript>: Just style a certain way and it's kind of unaware of.

03:00:09
<transcript>: the state

03:00:13
<transcript>: The State of the Game. It's just like, here's a button. It's styled.

03:00:13
<transcript>: to look like

03:00:23
<transcript>: To look like how I want buttons in the app to look, and then specifically, in a round, I do this weird styling to it. So I've kind of got my classes all split up. All my Hover States are down here.

03:00:30
<transcript>: This thing is unaware, and I kind of like it to be unaware of gamestate. Like it's just a button.

03:00:30
<transcript>: i'm just

03:00:41
<transcript>: I'm just overriding classes up here based on game state because this button happens to be used for the game, but I'm gonna use buttons for other things like that new game button. You know, I'm saying thanks for the follow Kai.

03:00:47
<transcript>: Do we need the choice as we already have all the choices on the page. I want to highlight the one that they chose.

03:00:58
<transcript>: Versus, like the one that was right. So I want to make the one they chose red, like you got it wrong. That's why I think I need the choice, right.

03:01:05
<transcript>: I think I'm definitely unsure on some of this.

03:01:05
<transcript>: choice

03:01:08
<transcript>: Choice and answer. We don't need correct.

03:01:08
<transcript>: you don't even need

03:01:09
umar_codes: Ah ok

03:01:10
<transcript>: You don't even need to store correct.

03:01:13
<transcript>: Well, that does simplify things.

03:01:13
<transcript>: add a lot

03:01:14
<transcript>: Add a lot.

03:01:18
<transcript>: But then down here, let's see.

03:01:18
<transcript>: you make

03:01:21
<transcript>: You make this whole thing bigger. I need more space.

03:01:23
<transcript>: More room.

03:01:23
<transcript>: for elbow

03:01:25
<transcript>: For elbows.

03:01:33
<transcript>: There we go. Okay. Correct. Is no longer a thing. It's just.

03:01:39
<transcript>: We always style the correct one as green.

03:01:39
<transcript>: so if

03:01:40
<transcript>: So if.

03:01:40
<transcript>: choice

03:01:43
<transcript>: Choice no if answer.

03:01:49
<transcript>: Equals that. Then we're going to delete this whole block.

03:01:51
<transcript>: Right.

03:01:56
<transcript>: Answer is the name.

03:02:00
<transcript>: We always style it.

03:02:09
<transcript>: And then otherwise we style it red it's the choice as the name and answer does not equal choice. Okay.

03:02:11
<transcript>: And answer.

03:02:15
<transcript>: Does not equal. Nope.

03:02:18
<transcript>: Does not equal.

03:02:21
<transcript>: Choice.

03:02:24
<transcript>: I think that's correct.

03:02:27
<transcript>: I still haven't fixed the Hover problem.

03:02:43
<transcript>: Still haven't fixed. Wow, there's, there's new services I've never heard of. Every time I come in here, this is Macy. So I'm gonna click Macy. And it's not gonna show green because it's it's hovered. So I don't know the best way to do that? The best way to rip out the Hover styles? What is the best way.

03:02:46
raulp: macie

03:02:47
<transcript>: I feel like the best way is just to be like.

03:02:47
<transcript>: hover

03:02:48
<transcript>: Hover.

03:02:53
<transcript>: Doesn't feel like the best way, but I'm gonna say Hover.

03:02:58
<transcript>: Green 500.

03:02:58
<transcript>: this just feel

03:02:59
<transcript>: This just feels so bad.

03:03:04
<transcript>: However, Tag Screen 500.

03:03:04
christoph0saurus: isn't it the focus styles you are trying to remove?

03:03:13
<transcript>: Hover after background Green 500 you see what I'm saying? Like that just feels super bad. It'll fix the problem.

03:03:20
<transcript>: Red, 500 have.

03:03:20
<transcript>: text

03:03:24
<transcript>: Text red. I'd rather just say you can't Hover it.

03:03:26
<transcript>: Hover after.

03:03:29
<transcript>: That ground? Red.

03:03:29
<transcript>: five hundred

03:03:33
<transcript>: 500. We can optimize later. This will work.

03:03:33
<transcript>: this

03:03:37
<transcript>: This should work. So, Clot, what is this? This is.

03:03:37
<transcript>: work

03:03:40
<transcript>: Work? Docs correct.

03:03:40
<transcript>: we

03:03:41
<transcript>: We did it.

03:03:43
raulp: i would be a real instant user once you deploy

03:03:48
<transcript>: It's the focus style, is it? I think it's I've only defined Hover styles, so it's got to be Hover.

03:03:50
raulp: SeemsGood

03:03:52
umar_codes: Is it hover or is it the active/focused state

03:03:53
<transcript>: You'll be a real instant user, huh? Raw. That sounds cool.

03:03:56
<transcript>: I'm hoping the AWS community will enjoy this.

03:03:56
<transcript>: is it how

03:04:04
<transcript>: Is it? How is the active focusing? Well, I think it's harder because I'm only defined Hover. I haven't defined any focus States.

03:04:04
<transcript>: test

03:04:05
umar_codes: Nice

03:04:06
<transcript>: Test it. We could say.

03:04:08
<transcript>: Focus.

03:04:08
<transcript>: is

03:04:09
<transcript>: Is.

03:04:09
<transcript>: background

03:04:12
<transcript>: Background red. 500 or something.

03:04:16
<transcript>: All right.

03:04:20
<transcript>: By this. So this is is this cloud shell? What is this.

03:04:22
christoph0saurus: as you could just do focus:none then for the one they have clicked?

03:04:23
<transcript>: I think this is cloud.

03:04:23
<transcript>: shell

03:04:24
<transcript>: Shell.

03:04:29
<transcript>: Oh, wrong. It's good. Pipeline. Okay. So we got to see that fail.

03:04:35
<transcript>: So the focus state if it were.

03:04:35
<transcript>: there's focus

03:04:40
<transcript>: There's focus date? Yeah. See, that's the focus state, which I need to fix and make it look better.

03:04:44
<transcript>: And let's just do that right now. So focus.

03:04:47
<transcript>: We want to do border none.

03:04:57
<transcript>: I want outline. None.

03:04:58
christoph0saurus: ah yeh. makes sense

03:05:00
parttimemarried: Tailwind is awesome until you have you r styling is minimal

03:05:02
<transcript>: Right.

03:05:05
<transcript>: Well.

03:05:12
<transcript>: Why am I in there? I want to be out here in my app.

03:05:17
<transcript>: Is it just.

03:05:23
<transcript>: There no styling. Oh, there's just no style. I did that.

03:05:23
<transcript>: i intentionally

03:05:26
<transcript>: I intentionally did that. Focus.

03:05:29
<transcript>: Border will say is going to be.

03:05:39
<transcript>: A lighter color or a darker color. I feel like there's a right answer to this. I'm going to choose the wrong thing most likely. But let's suit Orange. Twelve.

03:05:39
<transcript>: so i'm just

03:05:41
<transcript>: So I'm just guessing.

03:05:44
<transcript>: There we go. It's kind of white.

03:05:49
<transcript>: We'll do Orange, eleven.

03:05:49
<transcript>: that's the same

03:05:52
<transcript>: That's the same as Hover, though, isn't it? Maybe that's okay.

03:05:55
<transcript>: So now our focus, state.

03:05:55
<transcript>: looks

03:05:59
<transcript>: Looks like you can't hardly tell actually that it's focused.

03:06:02
<transcript>: But that's what it looks like on Hover.

03:06:02
<transcript>: oh there's

03:06:06
<transcript>: Oh, there's no Hover in mobile. So we're not seeing the Hover.

03:06:12
<transcript>: Now the hovers. Pretty subtle.

03:06:20
<transcript>: Focus. None. For when they have clicked.

03:06:30
<transcript>: Yeah. Can you do Hover? None. Is it? How is the active focus state? Can I just do Hover? None. Will that work? Matt, go slow. Thank you so much for the follow.

03:06:31
<transcript>: following

03:06:31
<transcript>: following is awesome

03:06:33
<transcript>: Following is awesome till you have.

03:06:33
<transcript>: your

03:06:35
<transcript>: Your styling is minimal.

03:06:48
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. Like, I still love hail. I mean, I think this is so much easier than working with CSS. In my opinion. I'm just. I'm working in my file, not going back and forth to spread into style sheets or whatever.

03:06:57
<transcript>: Okay. And I know there's other ways don't come at me I know there's other ways to get that effect, but I love tailwind. Focus. Outline none.

03:07:03
<transcript>: And Border Orange Eleven. I wanted to try and see if the Hover here.

03:07:07
<transcript>: I just say Hover none. Why do I think that's a thing.

03:07:10
<transcript>: If I hear, if I do.

03:07:14
<transcript>: Like delete.

03:07:18
<transcript>: There and I say none.

03:07:20
<transcript>: Just do nothing.

03:07:20
<transcript>: do less

03:07:23
<transcript>: Do less on Hover. I don't think that's actually a thing.

03:07:28
<transcript>: Health like.

03:07:28
<transcript>: wrong

03:07:37
<transcript>: Wrong. Aws, shield. Oh, it worked. It worked. No, it didn't. That was the green. I have to get it right. We gotta get it right. It's private. 5g.

03:07:40
<transcript>: Oh, it was worked.

03:07:43
<transcript>: Wait, is it just on mobile? That doesn't work.

03:07:46
<transcript>: I'm gonna guess this one's FSX.

03:07:52
<transcript>: Okay. So it doesn't work. Yeah. Now I can't do the Hover nun thing.

03:07:54
<transcript>: That's fine.

03:07:57
<transcript>: Looks like Guard duty.

03:07:59
<transcript>: It is.

03:08:01
<transcript>: Okay.

03:08:01
<transcript>: what else

03:08:03
<transcript>: What else do we need to do here.

03:08:07
<transcript>: You need to have a score.

03:08:10
<transcript>: That's an important piece of this puzzle.

03:08:10
<transcript>: that

03:08:14
<transcript>: That Honeycode naturally play the game. No, that's is that ECS.

03:08:14
<transcript>: is that what you see us

03:08:15
<transcript>: Is that what you see us? Looks like.

03:08:18
<transcript>: Yes.

03:08:20
<transcript>: Nailed it.

03:08:23
<transcript>: Okay.

03:08:23
<transcript>: so

03:08:29
<transcript>: So the gameplay of this, we want to have a timer to increase the pressure. We want to give you more points.

03:08:29
<transcript>: when

03:08:34
<transcript>: When you get it done really quickly versus.

03:08:34
<transcript>: if it takes

03:08:39
<transcript>: If it takes you a while, like at the buzzer, you get less points. So those are some things we're gonna do.

03:08:39
<transcript>: first i want to

03:08:41
<transcript>: First. I want to add.

03:08:45
<transcript>: Let's see. Let's actually create like.

03:08:50
<transcript>: Variable that represents the States. So here Let's.

03:09:08
<transcript>: Do like comps.

03:09:11
<transcript>: Per.

03:09:15
<transcript>: Equals C name.

03:09:21
<transcript>: Correct equals answer does not equal choice.

03:09:21
<transcript>: and

03:09:26
<transcript>: And choice does not earn choice. Does equal. See that name.

03:09:29
<transcript>: Right now. Then here. I can just say this is.

03:09:32
<transcript>: Correct.

03:09:32
<transcript>: and this is

03:09:33
<transcript>: And this is.

03:09:36
<transcript>: Incorrect.

03:09:36
<transcript>: okay

03:09:45
<transcript>: Okay. And then I can also do things like add an emoji. I want to add an emoji. So where do I want to add that I want to do.

03:09:46
mightycore1: !keyboard

03:09:46
fossabot: Adam uses a custom Mode Eighty mechanical keyboard, and has a collection of other Mode keyboards!

03:09:48
<transcript>: Let's say this is relative.

03:09:53
<transcript>: Oh, Jeez.

03:09:53
<transcript>: relative

03:09:55
<transcript>: Relative.

03:09:55
<transcript>: and then

03:09:57
<transcript>: And then we're gonna have a static.

03:09:57
<transcript>: emo

03:09:59
<transcript>: Emoji.

03:09:59
<transcript>: div

03:10:00
<transcript>: Div.

03:10:10
<transcript>: Absolute.

03:10:10
<transcript>: top

03:10:11
<transcript>: Top.

03:10:14
<transcript>: Right.

03:10:18
<transcript>: And then what I want to put in here.

03:10:22
<transcript>: We're gonna put in a mouth in there.

03:10:22
<transcript>: what emoji

03:10:26
<transcript>: What? Emoji. So if you get it wrong X. Emoji. I don't know.

03:10:30
jungai: what is your font ?

03:10:32
<transcript>: Good one for wrong.

03:10:37
<transcript>: Happy.

03:10:43
<transcript>: Okay, that's gonna be our wrong, and then we're gonna have a right.

03:10:49
<transcript>: So this is gonna be like.

03:10:58
<transcript>: Incorrect.

03:11:00
<transcript>: And.

03:11:06
<transcript>: Then we'll have a correct.

03:11:10
<transcript>: And we'll do, what do I want to do for the correct amount.

03:11:16
<transcript>: Are you Popper.

03:11:16
<transcript>: work

03:11:18
<transcript>: Work.

03:11:22
<transcript>: Maybe or should maybe be a green checkmark actually.

03:11:31
<transcript>: This is Game Sparks. I'm guessing.

03:11:34
<transcript>: Yeah, we did flash wrong first.

03:11:37
<transcript>: Looks like a flat, wrong.

03:11:40
<transcript>: Let's make this.

03:11:40
<transcript>: three

03:11:42
<transcript>: Three.

03:11:48
<transcript>: What's this one.

03:11:49
<transcript>: Is that IQ.

03:11:49
<transcript>: yeah

03:11:53
<transcript>: Yeah, it is. It's flashing wrong first. You see that.

03:11:56
<transcript>: Why is it doing that.

03:11:56
<transcript>: why is it doing that

03:11:59
<transcript>: Why is it doing that? What is your font? It is.

03:12:01
<transcript>: Operator mono.

03:12:01
<transcript>: but

03:12:05
<transcript>: But welcome to Chat. Mighty core.

03:12:10
<transcript>: And Jungjai? Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.

03:12:13
<transcript>: Okay. So these.

03:12:13
<transcript>: these are

03:12:15
<transcript>: These are flashing.

03:12:15
<transcript>: it's flashing

03:12:17
<transcript>: It's flashing. Incorrect. First.

03:12:17
<transcript>: so

03:12:23
<transcript>: So why is it flatching and correct answer doesn't equal choice and choice equals.

03:12:23
<transcript>: name

03:12:24
<transcript>: Name.

03:12:24
<transcript>: is

03:12:29
<transcript>: Is answer being passed into the component slightly after or something. How would that be.

03:12:29
<transcript>: oh

03:12:32
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. Just like that.

03:12:34
<transcript>: So we want to set choice.

03:12:37
<transcript>: Lower.

03:12:47
<transcript>: Like that. Now what do we got here? This is monitor.

03:12:52
<transcript>: Resilience hub? Oh, Geez, I don't know. Resilience hub. Got it.

03:12:54
<transcript>: New It All along.

03:12:54
<transcript>: never

03:12:57
<transcript>: Never doubted it for a second.

03:12:57
<transcript>: what

03:13:01
<transcript>: What is this one? That's a new one. I've never seen that IoT analytics.

03:13:08
<transcript>: Not Cert Manager IoT Analytics. It's not config.

03:13:11
<transcript>: Okay.

03:13:11
<transcript>: so our

03:13:14
<transcript>: So our gameplay is coming together.

03:13:23
<transcript>: We still got to add the FX ones are funny because it says FSX in the logo. So I'm gonna go with that. We'll give you some Gimmies every once in a while.

03:13:29
<transcript>: Let's get one wrong and just see that it looks right.

03:13:29
<transcript>: so this

03:13:31
<transcript>: So this is probably.

03:13:38
<transcript>: Devops guru. It is Devopscrew. Let's do ElastiCache.

03:13:38
<transcript>: wrong

03:13:40
<transcript>: Wrong. That looks pretty good.

03:13:42
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:13:42
<transcript>: i guess i shouldn't

03:13:46
<transcript>: I guess I shouldn't put the we shouldn't put the little emoji.

03:13:46
<transcript>: on the right

03:13:51
<transcript>: On the right one. If you got the answer wrong, that looks weird.

03:13:51
<transcript>: emoji

03:13:54
<transcript>: Emoji will just go on the one.

03:13:59
<transcript>: So incorrect.

03:14:04
<transcript>: Here. There's. Correct. And then there's.

03:14:06
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:14:27
<transcript>: Other I don't know how to name this naming things is hard.

03:14:34
<transcript>: But I feel like this is what I'm going for here.

03:14:41
<transcript>: This would be.

03:14:45
<transcript>: Other and toy.

03:14:45
<transcript>: and

03:14:49
<transcript>: And then down here we would only say if it's incorrect.

03:14:53
<transcript>: Correct and not other.

03:15:03
<transcript>: Chosen is better.

03:15:10
<transcript>: Oh, no, it's actually rename it.

03:15:10
<transcript>: shows

03:15:12
<transcript>: Shows them.

03:15:17
<transcript>: Let's try that.

03:15:22
<transcript>: Do we show in? Yeah. Okay. That makes sense.

03:15:22
<transcript>: that is dynamo

03:15:27
<transcript>: That is Dynamo. No, it's RDS. So I want to do a wrong one.

03:15:27
<transcript>: yeah

03:15:30
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. So we just show you that was the right one, but we don't do the.

03:15:30
<transcript>: emoji

03:15:32
<transcript>: Emoji. That doesn't make sense.

03:15:32
<transcript>: well that's

03:15:35
<transcript>: Well, that's a cool logo. It's like a rocket ship.

03:15:38
smoon3y: IsCorrectAnswer?

03:15:39
<transcript>: What would that be? Robo maker. Activate.

03:15:39
<transcript>: i activate

03:15:44
<transcript>: I activate. Yeah. Okay. So we just got our emoji there. I'm making sure.

03:15:48
<transcript>: Okay. I'm feeling pretty good.

03:15:48
<transcript>: about

03:16:00
<transcript>: About the basic mechanic. We just need to put some timing is correct answer. We were actually trying to get like, is this the thing they chose? So that's what that boolean was.

03:16:03
<transcript>: Okay.

03:16:03
<transcript>: let's

03:16:10
<transcript>: Let's let's add some timing to it. And we're gonna have, like, a timer, like a visual timer. So, you know, you've only got so much time left.

03:16:13
<transcript>: There needs to be more padding.

03:16:18
<transcript>: Thing. But there needs to be more padding.

03:16:22
<transcript>: In a round or in the whole thing. Probably the whole.

03:16:24
<transcript>: Thing.

03:16:26
<transcript>: Here we go.

03:16:26
<transcript>: replace that

03:16:29
<transcript>: Replace that with eight.

03:16:30
<transcript>: How's that looking.

03:16:30
<transcript>: that's

03:16:32
<transcript>: That's looking better.

03:16:35
<transcript>: Although.

03:16:35
<transcript>: it's

03:16:43
<transcript>: It's the bottom getting enough padding. It feels like it doesn't get enough padding. Because of these shadows, they don't obey the layout. They're kind of like.

03:16:43
<transcript>: jutting

03:16:51
<transcript>: Jutting into the side and the bottom so I might need to add some more padding to compensate. I need to add that to this one as well.

03:16:51
<transcript>: if i add

03:16:54
<transcript>: If I add it to here, then it would at least all be consistent.

03:16:56
<transcript>: Okay.

03:17:04
<transcript>: Pothesm. That's not capitalized, right. So there's some of the capitalizations pretty bad. But we'll get there.

03:17:09
<transcript>: Okay.

03:17:09
<transcript>: timer

03:17:13
<transcript>: Timer. It's time to add a timer. We've been dancing around it.

03:17:13
<transcript>: 's far too

03:17:15
<transcript>: 's Far Too long.

03:17:18
<transcript>: And then we can start thinking about multiplayer. I think.

03:17:21
<transcript>: So let's go to.

03:17:21
<transcript>: name

03:17:26
<transcript>: Name our game router. This is where all of our all the magic happens.

03:17:32
<transcript>: This is how we create a round. So now we're gonna start storing on the game object.

03:17:32
<transcript>: we're going to store

03:17:34
<transcript>: We're going to store a score.

03:17:44
<transcript>: You kind of got to get it right the first time. Like if I come up with a scoring system for this, and then later, I want to change it.

03:17:44
<transcript>: that doesn't

03:17:58
<transcript>: That doesn't work because we're gonna have a leaderboard and all the scores is no longer. It's like in baseball, like you count the Steroid Era. Sorry, that's an American reference. I bet nobody in the world cares about base. No one in America cares about baseball.

03:17:58
<transcript>: so

03:17:59
<transcript>: So.

03:17:59
exnihilo80: @jungai Operator Mono

03:18:06
<transcript>: But I do want to get it right. The first try. I want to make sure.

03:18:10
madlep: do weekly leaderboards or similar

03:18:13
<transcript>: Want to make sure we get the scoring system right. So when you answer.

03:18:13
<transcript>: the weekly

03:18:16
<transcript>: The Weekly Leaderboards are similar. That's a good idea.

03:18:21
<transcript>: We can reset the leader boards if we ever want to change what's going system.

03:18:21
<transcript>: okay

03:18:23
<transcript>: Okay.

03:18:23
<transcript>: so new

03:18:25
<transcript>: So new game create the game.

03:18:25
<transcript>: it's so slow i

03:18:28
<transcript>: It's so slow I wish I knew why this was so slow.

03:18:31
<transcript>: It's a game. And it creates.

03:18:36
<transcript>: Get random item resources.

03:18:38
<transcript>: Now, Why is it so slow.

03:18:43
<transcript>: I.

03:18:58
<transcript>: Answer it super fast and this actually happens to a query to find the round and then create a new round. So some for some reason to create game is slow or it's just like the initialization if I go back.

03:19:00
<transcript>: If I refresh.

03:19:00
<transcript>: and i create new game

03:19:09
<transcript>: And I create new game. Is it still slow after oh this. That was fast. So I wonder if it's just slow the first time the server spins up there's like some cold start stuff.

03:19:09
<transcript>: okay

03:19:12
<transcript>: Okay, that's cloud watch. Right.

03:19:21
<transcript>: Yeah, it is. I just keep getting sucked in and willing to play the game. So I know I've created something that at least I want to exist because I keep playing to play it.

03:19:28
<transcript>: So timing the way we're gonna do timing.

03:19:32
<transcript>: We're gonna add scores to the game and timing.

03:19:32
<transcript>: the way

03:19:38
<transcript>: The way timing will work, we'll have an expires on our let's go to our schema.

03:19:41
<transcript>: Let's.

03:19:48
<transcript>: Name and round so game.

03:19:48
<transcript>: is now going

03:19:49
<transcript>: Is now going to have a score.

03:19:49
<transcript>: which is

03:19:51
<transcript>: Which is a.

03:19:58
<transcript>: Well, I don't know anything about Prisma int, I guess. Yeah.

03:20:01
<transcript>: Fractions.

03:20:04
<transcript>: Inc.

03:20:06
<transcript>: Okay.

03:20:09
<transcript>: And then we have a.

03:20:13
<transcript>: On the round. We have an expires.

03:20:16
jungai: thank you SeemsGood

03:20:22
<transcript>: So we're gonna say this round is good for 10 seconds, and then it expires, and you can no longer answer on that round. Right.

03:20:26
<transcript>: That's the idea.

03:20:26
<transcript>: so

03:20:27
<transcript>: So.

03:20:27
<transcript>: round

03:20:29
<transcript>: Round.

03:20:29
<transcript>: some music

03:20:35
<transcript>: Some music anymore music. I think we just got through all the awesome ways out. Yeah.

03:20:39
<transcript>: Can I remove this.

03:20:43
<transcript>: Just want to remove it from my possible playlist.

03:20:46
<transcript>: And.

03:20:52
<transcript>: Let's go back and play the dream.

03:21:00
<transcript>: Okay.

03:21:00
<transcript>: and so we

03:21:08
<transcript>: And so we said, there's a score on our game, and then we're gonna have it expires. Which how do I represent a date time.

03:21:08
<transcript>: date

03:21:10
<transcript>: Date time like that.

03:21:14
<transcript>: So every round has an expiration.

03:21:14
<transcript>: thank you for the

03:29:21

<transcript>: It's just this country. It's like on North America, and it's.

03:29:37

03:29:41
<transcript>: Okay. Here we go. Back to.

03:29:41
<transcript>: the thing

03:29:43
<transcript>: The thing that we're doing.

03:29:44
yodavido: Been in FL for over 20yrs and I hate it here lol.

03:29:48
<transcript>: So we now have an expires on our round.

03:29:48
madlep: Technically Australia doesn't exist. It's a hoax.

03:29:50
mhzrerfani: I just saw your website public.dev and its awesome

03:29:52
<transcript>: What else.

03:29:52
mhzrerfani: well done

03:29:57
<transcript>: Expires on that thing too. Look at all these expires. Everything hasn't expires.

03:29:59
<transcript>: Okay.

03:29:59
<transcript>: that feels good

03:30:02
cowfacedude99: I think I made a good choice by going for cowfacedude LUL

03:30:05
kainthegame1: do you have a github with your dotfiles?

03:30:05
smoon3y: man the keyboard noise is satisfying

03:30:08
<transcript>: That feels good. Let's I think we need to do, like, MPX, Prisma, DB push maybe and like, Generate or something.

03:30:08
<transcript>: oh we

03:30:15
<transcript>: Oh we found changes that can be executed either crying column without default value. There are 71 rows.

03:30:19
<transcript>: What if I want to delete all the rows.

03:30:21
<transcript>: All database lost Yes.

03:30:24
<transcript>: Reset that database don't even care.

03:30:29
<transcript>: Now we're gonna do MPX Prisma, generate.

03:30:31
<transcript>: Okay.

03:30:37
<transcript>: Let's see what do I need to do now? I need to go into.

03:30:45
<transcript>: The game router and now when we create it shouldn't let me create one without providing the necessary data.

03:30:45
<transcript>: right

03:30:47
cowfacedude99: !github

03:30:48
fossabot: Adam's dotfiles live here: https://github.com/adamelmore/dotfiles

03:30:48
<transcript>: Right? Why is it letting me.

03:30:50
<transcript>: Lsp restart.

03:30:55
<transcript>: Why are you letting me do these things? There we go. Data. Now we're missing.

03:30:59
<transcript>: Where is it.

03:30:59
<transcript>: without

03:31:00
<transcript>: Without.

03:31:00
<transcript>: expires

03:31:06
<transcript>: Expires. Okay. So I can't create a round without expired, and I can't create a game.

03:31:06
<transcript>: without

03:31:07
<transcript>: Without.

03:31:17
<transcript>: Score, which I could have just defaulted to zero. I could have just set that in the database. But we're gonna do it explicitly here.

03:31:21
<transcript>: And then here we need an expires.

03:31:21
<transcript>: exp

03:31:25
<transcript>: Expires is going to be date.

03:31:25
<transcript>: date

03:31:26
<transcript>: Date.

03:31:28
<transcript>: New date.

03:31:33
<transcript>: I want.

03:31:41
<transcript>: When it's a date time. I guess you can just pass the JavaScript date in and Prisma does the that's the benefit of or M.

03:31:41
<transcript>: mike

03:31:47
<transcript>: Mike ISO formatted or anything like that. Just pass in a date. I need to do date plus.

03:31:51
<transcript>: Ten minute no. 10 seconds.

03:31:51
<transcript>: so here's

03:31:53
<transcript>: So here's what I'm gonna do. Javascript.

03:31:55
<transcript>: 10 seconds from now.

03:32:06
<transcript>: Australia doesn't exist as pins.

03:32:09
<transcript>: What else did I miss? Here.

03:32:09
<transcript>: been in florida

03:32:15
<transcript>: Been in Florida for over 20 years. And you hate it here. Oh, I'm sorry. Yo, David, welcome to Chat, though. At least just that.

03:32:15
<transcript>: at least

03:32:17
<transcript>: At least you're here.

03:32:32
<transcript>: Just saw your website powder. That's awesome. Thanks so much. Image MHD yeah, I need to get back to public. We were building an out on stream and then I took a detour for a month and a half. We're gonna get back to public. I've got a ton of stuff to build that's been designed. I need to work on it.

03:32:32
<transcript>: i think i made a good

03:32:35
<transcript>: I think I made a good choice by going for calf. Dude.

03:32:40
<transcript>: Do you have a GitHub with your Dot files? Yes, you found it.

03:32:40
<transcript>: the keyboard noise

03:32:51
yodavido: I survive lol. My wife is happy to be near family so it makes it somewhat bearable.

03:32:51
<transcript>: The keyboard noise is satisfying. I've heard that's. Good. I'm glad you enjoy it. That's half the keyboard, half my microphone. I think having a shotgun mic is a big part of that.

03:32:55
<transcript>: So 10 seconds from now add 10 seconds to a date.

03:32:55
<transcript>: i always have

03:33:01
<transcript>: I always have to look this up, so T seconds. There's no like nice.

03:33:01
<transcript>: way to do this

03:33:05
<transcript>: Way to do this. It always feels weird to like call.

03:33:05
<transcript>: like

03:33:07
<transcript>: Like methods on objects.

03:33:07
<transcript>: like this

03:33:10
<transcript>: Like this feels weird.

03:33:14
<transcript>: Okay. But that's what we're gonna do. You know what? So we're gonna do.

03:33:16
<transcript>: We're gonna say.

03:33:23
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow Yo, David and Axel.

03:33:23
<transcript>: i think

03:33:27
<transcript>: I think I saw everything else. So this is gonna be Const.

03:33:29
<transcript>: constant

03:33:30
<transcript>: Constant.

03:33:37
<transcript>: That's gonna be like that.

03:33:41
<transcript>: So.

03:33:41
<transcript>: expires

03:33:42
<transcript>: Expires.

03:33:42
<transcript>: no

03:33:44
<transcript>: No.

03:33:51
<transcript>: Fires. Set seconds, seconds, plus ten, and then expires. Here is going to be.

03:34:03
<transcript>: Expires 10 seconds from now. So what's that mean? That means on the front end, we can start a timer.

03:34:10
<transcript>: A timer that goes till the expired time.

03:34:16
<transcript>: And if we answer after expiration. So when the round comes in, when they answer.

03:34:18
<transcript>: Here.

03:34:20
<transcript>: We need to get the expires.

03:34:20
<transcript>: like that

03:34:23
<transcript>: Like that. No. What's wrong with that.

03:34:23
<transcript>: round and

03:34:25
<transcript>: Round and.

03:34:36
<transcript>: Round pussy has type any because it does not have a type annotation. And it's referenced directly or directly with that. What.

03:34:40
<transcript>: Sorry? What.

03:34:45
<transcript>: You're just wrong I think you're wrong round has that.

03:34:47
<transcript>: Reset.

03:34:55
<transcript>: Expires as a date perfect.

03:34:55
<transcript>: if

03:34:57
<transcript>: If expires.

03:34:59
<transcript>: Is.

03:34:59
<transcript>: let's see

03:35:00
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:35:07
<transcript>: You need to create an X round regardless.

03:35:10
<transcript>: But here.

03:35:14
<transcript>: We say if.

03:35:25
<transcript>: I don't want to do that. Don't want to tell the client that it actually just was too late.

03:35:25
<transcript>: if you

03:35:26
<transcript>: If you.

03:35:26
<transcript>: were

03:35:29
<transcript>: Were asked of the buzzer.

03:35:32
<transcript>: I guess I should tell the client that.

03:35:44
<transcript>: Because we'd show it in the UI differently.

03:35:48
<transcript>: Probably right.

03:35:55
<transcript>: Did you mind? I got the right answer. But you were too late.

03:36:12
<transcript>: Like that.

03:36:23
<transcript>: Still need to return the next round.

03:36:23
<transcript>: for the next

03:36:24
<transcript>: For the next.

03:36:24
<transcript>: thing

03:36:25
<transcript>: Thing.

03:36:33
<transcript>: Okay. I think I'm going to do it down here. I'm going to say else.

03:36:40
<transcript>: No. Because it could be if there's answers. Right too.

03:36:44
<transcript>: I do this in a nice way.

03:36:44
<transcript>: is it just stupid

03:36:46
cowfacedude99: how are you keeping track of the score?

03:36:47
<transcript>: Is it just stupidating? It return.

03:36:51
<transcript>: Correct is going to still be correct.

03:36:54
<transcript>: Or not.

03:37:01
mhzrerfani: add another variable?

03:37:03
<transcript>: I got it I gotta form some opinions here.

03:37:20
<transcript>: I believe you know, David, at least you've got your wife's family. That's nice. Being near family is worth suffering. Like I live in the Ozarks. It's not the best place in the world, but my family's here. So at least you have grandparents to help with kids, that kind of thing.

03:37:25
<transcript>: Not that you necessarily have kids, but how are you keeping track of the score? We're gonna do that.

03:37:29
<transcript>: Should follow fray in three.

03:37:29
<transcript>: nineteen

03:37:30
<transcript>: 19.

03:37:40
<transcript>: Sorry that was very mumbled. Thank you so much for the follow. When you start that when you say things all the time. Which I've said that 1706 times. I guess now.

03:37:40
<transcript>: you kind of start

03:37:42
<transcript>: You kind of start to just roll through it.

03:37:53
<transcript>: But thank you so much. It doesn't make me appreciated any less. I really do appreciate all your follows. I hope that means you'll be back. Hang out with me some more.

03:38:00
<transcript>: Okay. So.

03:38:00
<transcript>: now cup is

03:38:02
fanieldanara: Ozarks are beautiful!

03:38:03
yodavido: Yup best part was the free kid care from the grandparents.

03:38:04
<transcript>: Now cup is we're gonna put the score on the game object.

03:38:09
<transcript>: I'm just trying to figure out.

03:38:13
<transcript>: You send an answer that's too late.

03:38:16
<transcript>: Whether you were correct or not.

03:38:21
<transcript>: Here we go.

03:38:23
<transcript>: There we go.

03:38:34
<transcript>: This is all done.

03:38:36
<transcript>: Cops. Correct.

03:38:43
<transcript>: All dumb.

03:38:43
<transcript>: return

03:38:45
<transcript>: Return.

03:38:45
<transcript>: correct

<transcript>: Correct.

03:38:46
<transcript>: answer

03:38:48
<transcript>: Answer next.

03:38:50
<transcript>: Expired.

03:38:53
<transcript>: All that code just went away.

03:38:55
<transcript>: Delete.

03:38:55
<transcript>: fourteen

03:38:57
<transcript>: 14 J.

03:39:01
<transcript>: Nope. And delete it too much.

03:39:04
<transcript>: Okay. Look how much better that is.

03:39:09
<transcript>: Okay.

03:39:09
<transcript>: so much better

03:39:11
<transcript>: So much better.

03:39:20
<transcript>: Those Arcs are beautiful. They are. I mean, there's a lot of great things about the Ozarks. It's low cost of living.

03:39:23
<transcript>: There are some great natural.

03:39:30
cowfacedude99: lurking now, gotta start studying for gcp training.

03:39:32
<transcript>: Aspects like the geography there's like a lot of caves and streams and Rivers and Lakes. And it's a lot of, like natural beauty.

03:39:36
<transcript>: There are things socially. I'm not Super.

03:39:36
<transcript>: a fan of

03:39:48
<transcript>: A fan of it's a very like, I'm not gonna go into politics. It's just there's things about those arcs. I'm not a big fan of a lot of Mess. So there's a lot of drug usage in the Ozarks, but not like.

03:39:48
<transcript>: it's like dangerous

03:39:51
<transcript>: It's like dangerous drugs. Like the kind of drugs where people do really.

03:39:51
<transcript>: dumb stuff

03:39:53
madlep: convenient money laundering

03:39:54
<transcript>: Dumb stuff when they use those drugs.

03:39:56
<transcript>: So there's that.

03:39:56
<transcript>: yeah

03:40:01
<transcript>: Yeah, good luck, cow face on your studying. Appreciate you sticking around and lurking though.

03:40:16
<transcript>: Convenient money laundering. Yeah. There's the stuff that happens on the show.

03:40:16
<transcript>: thank you for the follow

03:40:19
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow HTML programmer.

dnbull: Youre black T's are clean what brand?

03:40:24
paloran: I'm here for the fake thought leadership! :)

03:40:34
<transcript>: You HTML programmer are with the trends. There's a shift back to HTML. Everybody's kind of rebelling against all the client side tooling and all the JSX and all the real react and all this stuff.

03:40:34
<transcript>: and people

03:40:38
<transcript>: And people been like, hey, remember HTML. That was fun. We did road. Html.

03:40:38
<transcript>: you

03:40:40
<transcript>: You are with it.

03:40:44
paloran: can you please give me a top 10 list i can read?

03:40:48
<transcript>: You're here for the fake thought leadership. Balren. Well, you're in the right place. I will pretend like I know things all day.

03:40:54
<transcript>: My Black Teaser Clean These are American apparel.

03:40:59
<transcript>: Black teas. I have like six of them. And I wear them every day.

03:41:10
<transcript>: Please do a ton list. Yeah if you want to get into cloud, here are ten things you need you need networking basics. Linux.

03:41:12
<transcript>: Kubernetes.

03:41:14
<transcript>: Docker.

03:41:14
<transcript>: python

03:41:15
<transcript>: Python.

03:41:15
<transcript>: javascript

03:41:16
<transcript>: Javascript.

03:41:18
<transcript>: What else.

03:41:19
paloran: I'm clicking all over the screen right now

03:41:32
<transcript>: Bash. I'm making this up. This is all just a bunch of fake nonsense, but this is the kind of stuff you see on Twitter. You get a list of ten things you should learn before you get into cloud. So dumb, so dumb. I hate it somehow.

03:41:32
<transcript>: clicking

03:41:34
<transcript>: Clicking all over the screen right now.

03:41:39
<transcript>: Like in a anger, palloring. You're just like.

03:41:43
<transcript>: Driving you crazy? That stuff drives me crazy.

03:41:49
<transcript>: Answer. Expires. Okay. So here's what we got.

03:41:52
<transcript>: That's right right expired would be.

03:41:52
<transcript>: if the

03:41:54
<transcript>: If the expiration.

03:41:59
shambor7: dont forget to type in colemak

03:41:59
<transcript>: Is before the current time, then yes, that would be expired. Okay.

03:42:04
<transcript>: Let's go back to our front end.

03:42:13
<transcript>: Now we've got some more stuff to work with here. So when we when we answer something right here.

03:42:13
<transcript>: we have

03:42:16
<transcript>: We have a response that answer.

03:42:23
<transcript>: We're gonna check first if the if it's expired if response dot.

03:42:23
<transcript>: respond

03:42:26
<transcript>: Respond. Response. Expired.

03:42:29
<transcript>: You do something.

03:42:29
mhzrerfani: my adam bucks is just going to be 420. I would fire up a joint :))

03:42:30
<transcript>: Do something.

03:42:32
<transcript>: We're doing.

03:42:39
<transcript>: We should just store.

03:42:39
<transcript>: the response

03:42:42
<transcript>: The response instead of all these separate.

03:42:52
<transcript>: I have answer choice. Maybe we should just store the whole response. What is the shape of the response? I don't even know.

03:42:59
<transcript>: Oh, that's right. This is the PRP sitting. I don't know the answer to how do I just grab that type? I want to do something with that type.

03:43:09
<transcript>: This is the thing I haven't figured out yet about TrpC.

03:43:14
<transcript>: Okay, let's just store.

03:43:21
<transcript>: Expired.

03:43:24
<transcript>: That expired.

03:43:24
<transcript>: so it's like a timeout

03:43:26
<transcript>: So it's like a timeout, right.

03:43:30
<transcript>: It's like you didn't do it in time.

03:43:36
<transcript>: Set Expired response.

03:43:45
<transcript>: That expired undefined undefined.

03:43:49
<transcript>: Okay. That feels bad. But that's what we're doing.

03:43:51
<transcript>: Choice.

03:43:51
<transcript>: and then

03:43:55
<transcript>: And then we're gonna pass expired into our round, I guess.

03:43:57
<transcript>: Feels bad.

03:44:08
<transcript>: Feels bad. I guess I could have just done all this stuff in the round. I could have just actually done the answering and all that. I should do that. Why am I doing it up here? This is dumb.

03:44:08
<transcript>: this is done

03:44:12
<transcript>: This is done. Handle. Answer should go inside.

03:44:17
<transcript>: Let's just make this a lot easier.

03:44:27
<transcript>: Okay. So there's no longer you don't pass in any of this nonsense. You just pass in.

03:44:32
<transcript>: The round. You even pass in the round. Yeah. You have to pass them around. Right.

03:44:35
<transcript>: Wait. Did I get to have myself.

03:44:39
<transcript>: Oh, because this thing okay. I got ahead of myself.

03:44:39
<transcript>: because

03:44:42
mhzrerfani: use svelte mate. cleaner and faster code. it's a good choice for personal projects

03:44:44
<transcript>: Because this thing does coordinate the next round, right. But I should have, like a game view or something.

03:44:50
<transcript>: Like a game component. Thank you for the follow AW.

03:44:59
<transcript>: You're adding Bucks? Is it 420.

03:45:09
<transcript>: Thing I think right now I do solid.

03:45:15
<transcript>: But I'm gonna stick with React for now I'm just gonna stick with Next JS specifically.

03:45:20
<transcript>: So I want to say Round Prop now has expired.

03:45:23
<transcript>: Boolean or undefined.

03:45:29
<transcript>: Expired. Okay.

03:45:32
shambor7: solid take mate

03:45:33
<transcript>: So now we know when something when you're too late.

03:45:33
<transcript>: so let's just

03:45:35
<transcript>: So let's just try being too late.

03:45:35
<transcript>: let's

03:45:40
<transcript>: Let's put something on the screen. It says, I go expired.

03:45:43
<transcript>: Or I guess I need expires.

03:45:46
<transcript>: Show in the round like I show a timer.

03:45:50
<transcript>: Another thing I need.

03:45:50
<transcript>: expires

03:45:53
<transcript>: Expires which is a date time.

03:46:02
<transcript>: That's a thing, right? That's a TypeScript thing. Date time? No, no, it's not. Is it? The sides trip have date form, date pipes.

03:46:04
<transcript>: Wait.

03:46:07
mhzrerfani: yes

03:46:08
<transcript>: Is it this a string.

03:46:12
<transcript>: Well let's look at our.

03:46:16
<transcript>: I need to return the expired.

03:46:19
<transcript>: Right.

03:46:25
paloran: date is a datetime in ts

03:46:26
<transcript>: Here so expired when you answer and you get a new round.

03:46:26
<transcript>: so create

03:46:28
<transcript>: So create round.

03:46:31
<transcript>: Here.

03:46:31
<transcript>: so i

03:46:34
<transcript>: So I need to return.

03:46:38
<transcript>: Oh, I am doing it. I am returning everything from the round.

03:46:40
<transcript>: So.

03:46:45
<transcript>: That should already have an expired.

03:46:51
<transcript>: Here, response.

03:46:55
<transcript>: Answer, or. Net.

03:46:57
<transcript>: Expires.

03:47:00
<transcript>: What is that type of data.

03:47:00
<transcript>: so that's

03:47:06
<transcript>: So that's the thing in TypeScript. There are dates. Of course there are there's dates in JavaScript. I'm dumb.

03:47:11
<transcript>: Eight is a date time in TS. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Patern.

03:47:21
<transcript>: Where am I.

03:47:21
<transcript>: i'm doing

03:47:22
<transcript>: I'm doing something.

03:47:27
<transcript>: Here. So when you create a new game, we get around.

03:47:32
<transcript>: Handle new game here so if current round.

03:47:32
<transcript>: we set current

03:47:38
<transcript>: We set current round here so okay so we already have the expires on the current round. I don't need.

03:47:38
<transcript>: have it expires

03:47:43
refugiointerior: Hello

03:47:44
<transcript>: Have it expires, but I do need to know when it expired, so let's show a little timer? We're gonna show a little progress bar.

03:47:49
<transcript>: Maybe between the two. I don't know. We'll just put it here for now.

03:48:02
<transcript>: Order.

03:48:02
<transcript>: two

03:48:03
<transcript>: Two border.

03:48:08
<transcript>: Green. I need to add Green is a thing.

03:48:13
<transcript>: As a rack color? What's wrong here? Prisma Game create.

03:48:13
<transcript>: score

03:48:15
<transcript>: Score unknown. R.

03:48:15
<transcript>: score

03:48:17
<transcript>: Score, but I need to research server. Yeah.

03:48:18
homiecoder: @adamdotdev sup! ur looking like a vim vet brah! hey chat!

03:48:21
<transcript>: I do.

03:48:27
<transcript>: Get.

03:48:33
<transcript>: Still slow. Okay, there's our little bar. We're gonna make it full width.

03:48:39
<transcript>: Well, why isn't it full with justify Center.

03:48:47
<transcript>: This won't actually fix that, will it? I did. Okay.

03:48:47
<transcript>: we're gonna put

03:48:48
<transcript>: We're gonna put.

03:48:51
<transcript>: Margin top on that so.

03:48:51
<transcript>: let's do

03:48:54
<transcript>: Let's do it here too. I guess.

03:49:01
<transcript>: Doesn't feel great.

03:49:01
<transcript>: but

03:49:04
<transcript>: But I might want to tweak those.

03:49:08
<transcript>: Okay. So there's our timer.

03:49:10
<transcript>: It's gonna be.

03:49:11
mhzrerfani: what api are u using?

03:49:14
<transcript>: I guess this is gonna be Gray.

03:49:23
<transcript>: I don't know yet.

03:49:25
<transcript>: Maybe nine.

03:49:30
<transcript>: Just the most Gray color. And then there's gonna be like one laying on top of it.

03:49:30
<transcript>: right

03:49:31
<transcript>: Right.

03:49:36
<transcript>: That's gonna be like, our timer. Maybe this should be like.

03:49:38
<transcript>: No.

03:49:40
<transcript>: Or.

03:49:42
<transcript>: Maybe like that.

03:49:46
<transcript>: I don't want to do that. Don't want to just.

03:49:51
<transcript>: Want to do.

03:50:03
<transcript>: Okay. So I wanted to like this. I want to say.

03:50:09
<transcript>: This doesn't have any styling. It just says the margin top and the width full.

03:50:14
<transcript>: And Then They're Gonna be.

03:50:14
<transcript>: relative

03:50:16
<transcript>: Relative.

03:50:18
<transcript>: So these are gonna be.

03:50:22
<transcript>: Laying on top each other absolute.

03:50:24
<transcript>: Right.

03:50:24
<transcript>: no

03:50:29
<transcript>: No. Why is that not inset. Insert zero.

03:50:35
<transcript>: Well, what happened to my.

03:50:39
<transcript>: Why is that margin? Not.

03:50:45
<transcript>: Just trying to see.

03:50:50
<transcript>: What.

03:50:55
<transcript>: This Div doesn't have any.

03:50:55
<transcript>: width

03:50:57
<transcript>: Width, full.

03:50:57
<transcript>: it doesn't have a

03:50:59
<transcript>: It doesn't have a height.

03:51:02

<transcript>: Two.

03:51:16
<transcript>: Okay, there's our that's that thing. Why is this. Oh, that has a margin top on it.

03:51:18
sergioquijano: Hey! Have you configured nvim from scratch or do you use some project like astrovim / lunarvim? Because it looks sick!

03:51:19
<transcript>: Do I need.

03:51:19
<transcript>: wood

03:51:24
<transcript>: Wood full. Okay. This is good. This is good. It's good.

<transcript>: We have whip for.

03:51:28
<transcript>: height

03:51:29
<transcript>: Height.

03:51:29
<transcript>: we're just making

03:51:33
<transcript>: We're just making this thing. What is I'm gonna be a border. It's just gonna be a background.

03:51:38
<transcript>: Background.

03:51:41
<transcript>: Gray.

03:51:41
<transcript>: nine

03:51:42
<transcript>: Nine.

03:51:48
<transcript>: Okay. And then we're gonna lay one right on top of it. That's gonna be like.

03:51:51
<transcript>: It's gonna have a different width, right.

03:51:55
<transcript>: Kind of be like width 20. I don't know.

03:51:59
<transcript>: It's gonna have a background of green.

03:52:05
<transcript>: There we go. There's a Loading bar, right.

03:52:08
<transcript>: Home.

03:52:09
<transcript>: homemy co

03:52:09
<transcript>: homemy coatr

03:52:13
<transcript>: Homemy coatr. You look like a Vim vet. Thank you so much.

03:52:13
<transcript>: i'm getting

03:52:16
<transcript>: I'm getting there. I'm learning.

03:52:29
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Rafujio and also thank you for the follow Thunder. I appreciate your follow me coder you subscribe to me for like a year in advance and for that I'm extremely grateful.

03:52:41
<transcript>: Also, just for you, I will make sure I am streaming for the next year. I'm not gonna stop. I might only stream two or three times a week. I might cut back to that. I would do my five days a week and then.

03:52:41
<transcript>: four and i

03:52:43
<transcript>: Four. And I'm like, maybe three.

03:52:43
<transcript>: i might cut it back

03:52:50
<transcript>: I might cut it back a bit just because can't go too hard but I will be streaming for this next year just for you homey coder.

03:52:55
<transcript>: Thank you for the follows. Vim, quiver and S can do easy.

03:52:57
homiecoder: Deal!!

03:53:01
<transcript>: What API Am I using.

03:53:01
<transcript>: i'm using

03:53:03
<transcript>: I'm using TrpC.

03:53:03
<transcript>: so

03:53:06
<transcript>: So that I don't need an API. You know, I'm saying.

03:53:06
<transcript>: with the

03:53:10
<transcript>: With the RPC, we don't need an API.

03:53:20
princejoogie: ow btw i have this nvim plugin for highlighting tailwind classes if you dig that sht

03:53:20
<transcript>: Have you configured Inv from scratch or do you use some project like Astrovember Lunarvim. So I started from scratch.

03:53:20
<transcript>: then we

03:53:22
princejoogie: https://github.com/princejoogie/tailwind-highlight.nvim

03:53:24
abdullahicyc: can you summerise what tRPC does ?

03:53:33
<transcript>: Then we spent a day on stream with Lunar Vem, and I realized I already kind of knew after just a little bit of time with Neovem, I already knew what plugins I went in and kind of how I wanted to configured. I really just tried to mirror my vs. Code experience.

03:53:40
abdullahicyc: i have seen it but have no clue

03:53:48
<transcript>: So I was able to go back to Neovem and configure it from scratch. Well, from scratch. We found a template by Chris It machines. It's a GitHub template that had a bunch of the plugins already. I stripped some out. I reconfigured some. I added some new ones. We kind of started with that as a baseline, though.

03:53:53
<transcript>: Yeah, all of it's there in my dot files you can play with.

03:53:56
<transcript>: My inventory config.

03:54:02
<transcript>: By the way, I have this infant plugin for highlighting tailwind classes. If you dig, that sounds kind of cool.

03:54:02
<transcript>: tailwind

03:54:07
<transcript>: Tailwind highlight. Okay. I'll take a look at that. I've got a few things here after the stream. I'm going to look at.

03:54:10
<transcript>: People that sent me.

03:54:16
<transcript>: Let's get a close and Tabs getting a little intense. Oh, that's interesting. It shows the colors highlighted. Cool.

03:54:25
<transcript>: First I'm Chat. Welcome to Chat Abdul Dula. Can you summarize what TrpC does? I have seen it, but have no clue. You know, if I could, I would.

03:54:29
<transcript>: I don't honestly, I don't really understand it's using RPC.

03:54:33
<transcript>: Which I'm gonna pretend like I know what that is some kind of natural networking thing.

03:54:43
<transcript>: And it generates somehow it doesn't generate code. It doesn't generate your types, but somehow it infers your types across the client server boundary. And I don't really understand how it works.

03:54:43
<transcript>: so maybe

03:54:47
<transcript>: So maybe hit up Alex or someone in the community that knows.

03:54:52
<transcript>: Or maybe you can just find like a video. Maybe somebody's explained.

03:54:52
<transcript>: how to

03:54:57
<transcript>: How to your PC exactly does what it does, but you get this, like full type safety.

03:54:57
<transcript>: full stack

03:54:58
<transcript>: Full stack.

03:54:58
<transcript>: and in and back

03:55:00
<transcript>: And in and back.

03:55:10
<transcript>: Yeah, there's some things I still don't understand. Like can I use the types that it's inferring or generating for me? I can't seem to figure out how I didn't see it in the box, but.

03:55:13
<transcript>: Yeah, it works really well.

03:55:15
umar_codes: yes you can

03:55:16
umar_codes: 2 secs

03:55:17
abdullahicyc: thanks man

03:55:19
<transcript>: Pretty cool you make a change on the back end. You immediately see your types updated on the front end. Pretty cool.

03:55:24
<transcript>: No problem, but you can Umar. You can.

03:55:24
<transcript>: tell me

03:55:25
<transcript>: Tell me how.

03:55:25
<transcript>: like i want

03:55:29
umar_codes: https://trpc.io/docs/v9/infer-types

03:55:29
<transcript>: Like I want to reference the types that are returned from my queries.

03:55:29
<transcript>: and

03:55:35
<transcript>: And right now I'm doing this dumb thing where I've defined a type, basically, what's coming back from.

03:55:35
<transcript>: from

03:55:37
<transcript>: From the thing.

03:55:37
<transcript>: but yeah i'd

03:55:39
<transcript>: But yeah, I'd love to not do that.

03:55:46
umar_codes: checkout that link

03:55:48
<transcript>: Okay. So our timer now this is we just made this little timer. This little, like, fake Loading bar. That's gonna be like, you only have 10 seconds.

03:55:48
<transcript>: it's like moving

03:55:51
<transcript>: It's like moving and then expired. And it goes.

03:55:51
<transcript>: check out the link

03:55:54
<transcript>: Check out the link infer types.

03:55:54
<transcript>: copy link

03:55:58
<transcript>: Copy link. Let's see. This is important to me. Really look at this right now.

03:56:01
princejoogie: might be faster to vertically move with { and } or ctrl+d/ctr+u

03:56:12
<transcript>: It's often useful to rap functionality of your Tierpc client or TC reacting API with another functions for this part. Yes Nestle is there to be able to infer input types, Apple types and API to pass generated by your tapestry sugar. Yes Yes.

03:56:18
<transcript>: Okay.

03:56:25
<transcript>: So where am I doing this? So let's see enum containing all API query pads.

03:56:31
<transcript>: Oh so like I.

03:56:33
<transcript>: Import.

03:56:33
<transcript>: tquery

03:56:34
<transcript>: Tquery.

03:56:34
<transcript>: is an en

03:56:35
umar_codes: so youll want to use inferQueryOutPut

03:56:36
<transcript>: Is an enum.

03:56:40
<transcript>: Oh, let's see here. So if I got rid of this type.

03:56:40
<transcript>: let's just

03:56:47
<transcript>: Let's just delete that thing. So now this round. And instead of round, this is.

03:56:49
<transcript>: A tquery.

03:56:49
<transcript>: or t muta

03:56:51
<transcript>: Or T mutation.

03:56:51
<transcript>: i import that

03:56:54
<transcript>: I import that from somewhere.

03:56:56
umar_codes: youll have to create that file first though

03:56:59
<transcript>: Let's see server router.

03:57:03
<transcript>: Where did I see that server? Common.

03:57:03
<transcript>: bb

03:57:05
<transcript>: Bb.

03:57:07
<transcript>: Types.

03:57:08
umar_codes: its not part of the trpc server package

03:57:09
<transcript>: I see that.

03:57:09
<transcript>: utils

03:57:10
<transcript>: Utils.

03:57:10
<transcript>: here

03:57:15
<transcript>: Here. Export type infer query output infer query input.

03:57:18
<transcript>: Those are the types I would use.

03:57:21
<transcript>: I guess.

03:57:21
<transcript>: guess

03:57:23
<transcript>: Guess those are.

03:57:23
<transcript>: right

03:57:23
umar_codes: yup

03:57:24
<transcript>: Right.

03:57:27
<transcript>: So infer.

03:57:27
<transcript>: query

03:57:30
<transcript>: Query output and firm mutation.

03:57:30
<transcript>: out

03:57:32
<transcript>: Output.

03:57:35
<transcript>: Is what I would want, right? So.

03:57:35
<transcript>: infer

03:57:36
<transcript>: Infer.

03:57:40
<transcript>: Mutation output.

03:57:42
umar_codes: so you would something like inferQueryOuput<"ADD_QUERY_HERE">

03:57:43
<transcript>: A mutation output. I think it is.

03:57:53
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. And then I put the name of the Mutation game new, that kind of thing.

03:57:56
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:58:04
<transcript>: So let's see. Is that what I want the round to be? I want to pass in current round which is.

03:58:08
<transcript>: Current round.

03:58:13
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. Here. This is not around.

03:58:13
<transcript>: it

03:58:14
<transcript>: It's a.

03:58:17
<transcript>: Okay. I can do this better.

03:58:17
<transcript>: i can do this better

03:58:19
<transcript>: I can do this better now that I know how to do this.

03:58:19
<transcript>: resource

03:58:22
<transcript>: Resource from server rider? What.

03:58:27
<transcript>: An import resource try to import infirmutation wise.

03:58:30
shambor7: according to the docs, tRPC opens an interdimensional portal on every http requst to cross the Great Server Divivide, which was sealed thousands of years ago by the Sumerian god Marduk, may all bless his generic types

03:58:39
<transcript>: So here when we get the response back. This response. This is a mutation.

03:58:39
<transcript>: answer muta

03:58:41
<transcript>: Answer mutation.

03:58:41
<transcript>: so this

03:58:46
<transcript>: So this response type I could store the whole thing.

03:58:46
<transcript>: here so i'm

03:58:52
<transcript>: Here. So I'm not doing this, like weird thing where I'm like response, side answer, response. I expired. I can do cons.

03:58:54
<transcript>: console

03:58:56
<transcript>: Console response.

03:58:59
<transcript>: Is it just on the mutation itself.

03:59:03
<transcript>: Like can I just do answering mutation.

03:59:05
<transcript>: Data.

03:59:05
<transcript>: yeah

03:59:06
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:59:08
<transcript>: Sure can.

03:59:11
<transcript>: So draw out and just store anything.

03:59:14
<transcript>: This dumb.

03:59:19
<transcript>: I just didn't store the use. I mean, I need to.

03:59:25
<transcript>: Wait. Because now I can just say.

03:59:25
<transcript>: down here

03:59:26
<transcript>: Down here.

03:59:33
<transcript>: Answer, and we're not even gonna do that. We're just gonna pass in the whole body so round.

03:59:33
<transcript>: is gonna be

03:59:35
<transcript>: Is gonna be mutation output.

03:59:35
<transcript>: for game

03:59:37
<transcript>: For game answer.

03:59:37
<transcript>: but

03:59:41
<transcript>: But it's also it could also be game new.

03:59:50
<transcript>: Let's see here. Instead of passing the round we Pant so it could be.

03:59:50
<transcript>: or

03:59:53
<transcript>: Or infer mutation output.

03:59:55
<transcript>: Game new.

03:59:58
<transcript>: Or I could also.

04:00:05
<transcript>: Create a type here that's like type round equals.

04:00:14
<transcript>: And then infer mutation output.

04:00:15
nexxeln: howdy

04:00:16
<transcript>: Game new.

04:00:16
<transcript>: and we

04:00:18
<transcript>: And we want to pick.

04:00:18
<transcript>: the

04:00:19
<transcript>: The.

04:00:22
<transcript>: Round.

04:00:22
<transcript>: i got

04:00:24
<transcript>: I gotta look at it.

04:00:35
<transcript>: Here.

04:00:35
<transcript>: so when you

04:00:39
<transcript>: So when you do round when you do new you get back around.

04:00:42
<transcript>: Looks like that.

04:00:42
<transcript>: answer choices

04:00:45
<transcript>: Answer choices. Id. Gaming D okay. Expires.

04:00:47
<transcript>: So.

04:00:47
<transcript>: you just

04:00:52
<transcript>: You just get that back. That's just all you get. So there's no picking on this one. I just want the whole thing.

04:00:55
<transcript>: Okay.

04:01:00
<transcript>: So here.

04:01:08
<transcript>: Round is not pick. It's just infer mutation output.

04:01:19
<transcript>: That's round right.

04:01:22
<transcript>: Right.

04:01:30
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow Dugan.

04:01:38
<transcript>: According to the Docks Tariffs opens an interim dimensional portal on every Http request across the Great Server divide.

04:01:38
<transcript>: to seal thousand

04:01:49
<transcript>: To seal thousands of years ago by the Sumerian Gun Mardoc. All blessings, generic types. Howdy nexalm you're here. Next one. We were just learning about PrPC stuff that I didn't understand.

04:01:55
<transcript>: Specifically, I was trying to understand how I could use these inferred mutation types. This is exactly what I wanted.

04:01:58
nexxeln: why are you making a type for this?

04:01:59
<transcript>: So that's round so you pass it around.

04:02:03
<transcript>: And I feel like I should also say.

04:02:06
<transcript>: It's infer that or.

04:02:08
<transcript>: Or.

04:02:09
<transcript>: It's pick.

04:02:12
nexxeln: ah you're using it in props

04:02:13
<transcript>: Infer mutation output.

04:02:13
<transcript>: game

04:02:15
<transcript>: Game answer.

04:02:19
<transcript>: And then it's gonna be next.

04:02:19
<transcript>: click

04:02:22
alpha_man_47: !distro

04:02:23
<transcript>: Click. That right. No. What's wrong with that.

04:02:26
<transcript>: What's wrong with that.

04:02:31
<transcript>: 's Wrong with everything.

04:02:35
<transcript>: Pick. Can I do that.

04:02:36
princejoogie: missing >

04:02:36
bearsample: i don't think you can pick from generics. not sure

04:02:39
<transcript>: Do that.

04:02:39
<transcript>: oh i didn't

04:02:42
<transcript>: Oh, I didn't add enough.

04:02:42
<transcript>: of those

04:02:45
<transcript>: Of those so that's still not good. What's wrong.

04:02:50
<transcript>: Generic pick. A type pick requires two type arguments.

04:02:53
nexxeln: you can't pick yeah

04:02:54
<transcript>: Infer Oh.

04:02:57
<transcript>: Right there.

04:03:01
<transcript>: Oh, okay, that's ramped.

04:03:07
<transcript>: So it's either that or I tried to pick next, though. Right.

04:03:16
<transcript>: Yeah, yeah. I picked the next thing, which it looks exactly the same, doesn't it? I just want to make sure I could just pass without casting. I could pass the next property.

04:03:16
<transcript>: into this

04:03:18
<transcript>: Into this thing. Okay, so delete.

04:03:21
<transcript>: Delete to.

04:03:25
<transcript>: Let's just do.

04:03:25
<transcript>: round

04:03:27
<transcript>: Round. Okay.

04:03:27
<transcript>: so that's

04:03:29
<transcript>: So that's around.

04:03:32
<transcript>: Here you don't have round.

04:03:32
<transcript>: answer

04:03:35
<transcript>: Answer why.

04:03:37
<transcript>: Oh, because I was expecting.

04:03:39
<transcript>: Wait.

04:03:43
<transcript>: Does not exist on type round really.

04:03:50
<transcript>: Answer does exist. Oh, it's a string. In that case, oh, EW.

04:03:56
<transcript>: Well, now it shouldn't be because I picked right. I tried to pick the next.

04:03:58
<transcript>: You simply say, I'm saying, there.

04:03:58
<transcript>: 's not do that

04:04:00
<transcript>: 's not do that.

04:04:07
<transcript>: I could just say that. And does that work? Yeah. Okay. So maybe I didn't need to do that. Picking nonsense.

04:04:08
nexxeln: why are you inferring and passing it as props?

04:04:09
<transcript>: So, what? I.

04:04:12
<transcript>: Just didn't need that.

04:04:12
<transcript>: okay

04:04:13
<transcript>: Okay.

04:04:13
<transcript>: okay

04:04:15
<transcript>: Okay.

04:04:18
<transcript>: Forbidden on old. I still need to do that.

04:04:19
nexxeln: just useQuery in the component you want the data

04:04:25
<transcript>: I was able to get rid of that. That feels good because that's the actual type.

04:04:27
<transcript>: Yeah.

04:04:27
<transcript>: the set

04:04:32
<transcript>: The set current round we're doing current round is a round. Great.

04:04:32
<transcript>: when

04:04:34
<transcript>: When you handle an answer.

04:04:45
<transcript>: I guess it just figures out that the title line. I don't need to do the thing I was doing here with the pick. Trying to get fancy. Sometimes you're just trying to get fancy when you don't need to.

04:04:45
umar_codes: Pretty sweet right?

04:04:49
<transcript>: Okay. So now we don't pass an answer.

04:04:49
<transcript>: we

04:04:53
<transcript>: We do pass an expired though.

04:04:53
ziindev: @adamdotdev how can I get a type from trpc to use in a getStaticProps function?

04:04:57
<transcript>: Right. No.

04:04:59
<transcript>: Yes.

04:05:04
<transcript>: And I think this thing is different than, yeah, this is different.

04:05:07
<transcript>: We still need to pass these.

04:05:07
<transcript>: in i guess

04:05:09
<transcript>: In I guess.

04:05:13
<transcript>: Or we could just do answer response passed in.

04:05:15
<transcript>: Let's do that.

04:05:15
<transcript>: so it takes

04:05:19
<transcript>: So it takes in the round. But it also takes in.

04:05:23
<transcript>: Forget this.

04:05:23
<transcript>: and this

04:05:24
nexxeln: https://trpc.io/docs/v9/ssg-helpers

04:05:25
<transcript>: And this.

04:05:28
<transcript>: Is choice pass in from the back end.

04:05:29
nexxeln: @ziindev there

04:05:34
<transcript>: I'm probably losing people here in terms of what I'm trying to accomplish.

04:05:34
<transcript>: it may not be clear

04:05:38
<transcript>: It may not be clear at this point. Just cleaning things out from a types standpoint.

04:05:40
<transcript>: Game.

04:05:41
ziindev: thank you @nexxeln

04:05:45
<transcript>: So we do we pass. Correct answer. Next. Expired. Okay.

04:05:50
<transcript>: I do still need to provide the choice.

04:05:52
<transcript>: But here.

04:05:55
<transcript>: We're going to do.

04:05:55
<transcript>: answer

04:05:56
<transcript>: Answer.

04:05:56
<transcript>: and

04:06:00
<transcript>: And it's gonna be infirmutation output.

04:06:00
<transcript>: game

04:06:03
<transcript>: Game answer like that.

04:06:04
ziindev: I just follow two of your tutorials hehe, nice to chat with you btw

04:06:07
<transcript>: Right, I'm gonna make it a little nicer by saying answer.

04:06:17
<transcript>: Okay.

04:06:20
nexxeln: oh which two

04:06:21
<transcript>: Okay, answer.

04:06:21
<transcript>: andrew

04:06:25
<transcript>: Andrew okay choice round answer.

04:06:27
<transcript>: Choice expired. Okay.

04:06:29
<transcript>: Expired is not a thing.

04:06:29
<transcript>: it's on

04:06:32
<transcript>: It's on the answer itself. Okay.

04:06:32
<transcript>: okay

04:06:34
<transcript>: Okay.

04:06:38
<transcript>: Answer is no longer a string. Answer is an object.

04:06:38
<transcript>: that has

04:06:40
<transcript>: That has.

04:06:40
<transcript>: an answer

04:06:40
ziindev: TRPC and T3 stack

04:06:43
<transcript>: An answer on it. So we're gonna come up with a better name for this type.

04:06:47
<transcript>: That's what we would do.

04:06:47
ziindev: the guestbook

04:06:49
nexxeln: coooool

04:06:52
<transcript>: And then we don't pass that we pass the.

04:06:55
<transcript>: Answermutation data.

04:06:57
<transcript>: Here.

04:07:00
ziindev: pretty nice

04:07:04
<transcript>: That's not correct. Can't do that.

04:07:08
<transcript>: We'll type correct billionaires? Or why not.

04:07:14
<transcript>: Undefined. As I said, I'll type. Oh, so it can't be unfinished? Yeah, I just need to go to the.

04:07:14
<transcript>: here and we need to

04:07:17
<transcript>: Here, and we need to say it could be done to find.

04:07:18
nexxeln: @adamdotdev i don't think you need to do this and go into type hell

04:07:24
<transcript>: There's no expires. Okay, we're getting there. We're getting there.

04:07:31
<transcript>: I don't think you need to do this and go into type L. Oh, no. Am I going to the Thai pal? No.

04:07:31
<transcript>: should have read the

04:07:39
<transcript>: Should have read the read this sooner. How can I get a tight from TFC to use in a get static spot function? I think Zinned, I think what we're doing right now.

04:07:42
<transcript>: I think what we're doing right now.

04:07:46
<transcript>: Howdy using an improv.

04:07:54
<transcript>: Missing. Yeah, I think you can pick them J. Okay, you guys right. Just responding to my dumb stuff I was doing earlier.

04:07:54
<transcript>: why don't you

04:07:58
<transcript>: Why don't you inferring passing it as props.

04:07:58
<transcript>: just

04:08:02
<transcript>: Just use query and the component. You want the data. Oh, that's a good call.

04:08:10
<transcript>: That's a great call. Next one. Why am I doing the query outside on the parent and passing it in.

04:08:10
<transcript>: why am i

04:08:12
<transcript>: Why am I doing that so.

04:08:18
<transcript>: I started to say, we just do the answering in the round.

04:08:22
<transcript>: And I think that's probably still good.

04:08:24
<transcript>: Why did I not do that.

04:08:26
<transcript>: Current round.

04:08:33
<transcript>: You know, I don't know why I didn't do it. I think it should just be in the round.

04:08:33
<transcript>: well

04:08:35
<transcript>: Well for one thing.

04:08:43
<transcript>: The naming. I think I just need to name this component differently. I think it's just like a game component.

04:08:43
<transcript>: and it

04:08:46
<transcript>: And it happens to have right? Yeah, Yeah.

04:08:46
<transcript>: watch it

04:08:49
<transcript>: Watch it. Okay, Gr game.

04:08:53
<transcript>: This is now the game component. Okay.

04:08:55
<transcript>: And it doesn't have any props.

04:08:55
<transcript>: only gonna

04:08:57
<transcript>: Only gonna use any props.

04:09:04
<transcript>: Like any props, right.

04:09:04
<transcript>: we're just gonna

04:09:07
<transcript>: We're just gonna have a game here.

04:09:08
cowfacedude99: I am sorry for this again. LUL

04:09:09
<transcript>: Current round.

04:09:09
<transcript>: so the only thing

04:09:11
<transcript>: So the only thing is like.

04:09:11
<transcript>: this

04:09:15
<transcript>: This parent needs to render something if there's no current game.

04:09:24
<transcript>: So I think this parent still does create the new game, or it calls a new game. Mutation. Yeah, Yeah.

04:09:32
<transcript>: But then from there it just passes the game ID into the game. Ea. Okay, okay.

04:09:36
<transcript>: This is gonna be a game.

04:09:41
<transcript>: And none of this stuff.

04:09:45
<transcript>: Figures for gets better hang hikes.

04:09:45
<transcript>: game

04:09:47
<transcript>: Game ID.

04:09:51
<transcript>: Okay, so you have to set that game ID.

04:09:56
<transcript>: Okay.

04:10:00
<transcript>: Game ID and then we're gonna move.

04:10:00
<transcript>: all of

04:10:02
<transcript>: All of this.

04:10:07
<transcript>: Let's yank the function.

04:10:22
<transcript>: Okay.

04:10:24
<transcript>: So currently.

04:10:30
<transcript>: We wear but better this time handle, answer.

04:10:30
<transcript>: take

04:10:34
<transcript>: Take a choice. We have a game. Id.

04:10:39
<transcript>: I guess we do need the first round.

04:10:47
<transcript>: When we create a game, we actually.

04:10:52
<transcript>: Separate those things. Let's go back to our game router.

04:10:58
<transcript>: Game router and let's not have it create a round on this.

04:11:01
<transcript>: It just returns the game.

04:11:08
<transcript>: Answer should return the game state as well.

04:11:15
<transcript>: We need to have the score. We're gonna do that in a minute. We're gonna do that in a minute.

04:11:15
<transcript>: look at yourself

04:11:16
<transcript>: Look at yourself.

04:11:16
<transcript>: handle new

04:11:20
<transcript>: Handle new game set current round is not a thing.

04:11:20
<transcript>: we are going

04:11:23
<transcript>: We are going to set the game ID.

04:11:27
<transcript>: So current round not a thing.

04:11:32
<transcript>: Choice also notice I don't know types of thing I guess.

04:11:33
<transcript>: There'll be a thing over here.

04:11:48
<transcript>: Hang tight, we're getting there everything is broken but we're getting there handle new game response and then we're gonna have cops game ID.

04:11:52
cowfacedude99: against my better judgement, I am going to wait till you are done with the refactor

04:11:53
<transcript>: We'll just have a game, game, set, game.

04:11:57
<transcript>: Equals react use state.

04:11:57
<transcript>: and it's gonna

04:11:59
<transcript>: And it's gonna be.

04:11:59
<transcript>: infer

04:12:02
<transcript>: Infer mutation output.

04:12:02
<transcript>: from

04:12:05
<transcript>: From game new.

04:12:12
<transcript>: And then this is just going to be set. Game response.

04:12:17
<transcript>: And then handle, answer. This is all gone now.

04:12:24
<transcript>: Head main current round okay, so if not game.

04:12:24
<transcript>: to create that

04:12:27
<transcript>: To create that button if game.

04:12:27
<transcript>: we do

04:12:28
<transcript>: We do a game.

04:12:30
<transcript>: And.

04:12:35
<transcript>: I need to carry all this stuff forward. So the answer mutation is Loading.

04:12:37
<transcript>: We'll figure that out.

04:12:40
<transcript>: Okay.

04:12:43
<transcript>: Name ID.

04:12:43
<transcript>: equals

04:12:44
<transcript>: Equals.

04:12:44
<transcript>: game

04:12:47
<transcript>: Game ID. Okay.

04:12:56
<transcript>: So now our Game Picks in a Game ID.

04:12:59
<transcript>: Need to create an initial round.

04:13:07
<transcript>: So I need to do that on the server. Need to have a mutation for creating a new round.

04:13:12
<transcript>: Right.

04:13:16
<transcript>: Like I should be looking at.

04:13:18
<transcript>: Chat.

04:13:30
<transcript>: I'm sorry for this again. Against my better judgment, I'm going to wait till you were done with the refactor.

04:13:30
<transcript>: no tell

04:13:34
<transcript>: No. Tell me, what is it? Tell me. Tell me. Calface.

04:13:35
<transcript>: Tell me.

04:13:41
<transcript>: I need to know. What is it? So this is gonna be game.

04:13:47
<transcript>: It's kind of a dumb name. There is no input.

04:13:50
<transcript>: Yeah, I guess there is. There's a game. Id.

04:13:57
<transcript>: Resolve contact input.

04:13:59
nexxeln: you're pretty fast with vim now nice

04:14:02
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the follow lost wisdom.

04:14:12
cowfacedude99: I was going to rick roll you, but decided to wait.

04:14:14
<transcript>: I'm pretty fast with them now. Thanks. Next one. It's hard for me to tell. Like I know there's so much I need to do to improve my horizontal navigation and my vertical navigation are terrible, but I'm getting there. Game.

04:14:17
<transcript>: Data. Let's see.

04:14:17
<transcript>: i'm gonna create

04:14:21
<transcript>: I'm gonna create a round which already have like a helper for that, don't I.

04:14:23
<transcript>: Yeah.

04:14:26
<transcript>: Helper for that.

04:14:31
<transcript>: Yeah. Let's just delete all this.

04:14:31
<transcript>: and let's

04:14:34
<transcript>: And let's say.

04:14:39
<transcript>: Cuts Round equals.

04:14:43
<transcript>: And what I pass into this.

04:14:49
<transcript>: Prisma. So, context, Prisma, and.

04:14:51
<transcript>: Game ID.

04:14:51
<transcript>: so

04:14:55
<transcript>: So input game ID. Okay.

04:14:59
<transcript>: And then I return the round.

04:15:09
<transcript>: That's how you do game start. So you create a game that's different from starting a game.

04:15:09
<transcript>: i don't know

04:15:15
<transcript>: I don't know. We might have like when it's multiplayer. You might create a game by choosing like you want to start a new game and host, but you're not starting it yet.

04:15:15
<transcript>: until

04:15:20
<transcript>: Until the other person joins. And then you start the game and you get your first round kind of distinct.

04:15:20
<transcript>: operations you know

04:15:22
<transcript>: Operations. You know, I'm saying.

04:15:22
<transcript>: so starting

04:15:26
<transcript>: So starting the game gives you your first round. You pass in the game ID.

04:15:37
<transcript>: Answer. Does anything change here? I don't think so. I think this is all the same. I do need to return. We'll get to the scoring stuff in a bit. Okay.

04:15:37
<transcript>: so now

04:15:39
<transcript>: So now we have a.

04:15:39
<transcript>: game

04:15:49
<transcript>: Game which is gonna have a start game. Mutation. Comps. Start game. Mutation equals. I forgot how to do mutation.

04:15:53
<transcript>: Well, I can bring this one down here. I need this.

04:16:00
<transcript>: Answer. Mutations. A start game. Mutation is gonna look like this one. It's gonna be TrpC.

04:16:04
<transcript>: Use mutation.

04:16:09
<transcript>: Start. Okay. Cool.

04:16:15
<transcript>: Handle answer let's see so we need to have current round.

04:16:20
<transcript>: Let's call it round. Just assumed.

04:16:22
<transcript>: That's the current round.

04:16:22
<transcript>: equals

04:16:23
<transcript>: Equals.

04:16:25
<transcript>: React.

04:16:25
<transcript>: usetate

04:16:26
<transcript>: Usetate.

04:16:29
<transcript>: And the type is going to be infer.

04:16:33
<transcript>: Patient output.

04:16:39
<transcript>: Of game start.

04:16:41
<transcript>: At.

04:16:45
<transcript>: So if round.

04:16:57
<transcript>: Game mutation. So first thing when you create a game.

04:16:57
<transcript>: for

04:17:00
<transcript>: For now, I guess I'm just gonna.

04:17:00
<transcript>: start it immediately

04:17:01
<transcript>: Start it immediately.

04:17:07
<transcript>: Yeah. We're just gonna start it immediately. For now.

04:17:18
<transcript>: What is that.

04:17:18
<transcript>: where

04:17:19
<transcript>: Where did I go.

04:17:19
<transcript>: where am i

04:17:21
<transcript>: Where am I.

04:17:23
<transcript>: What happened.

04:17:23
<transcript>: okay

04:17:27
<transcript>: Okay use effect we're gonna do start game.

04:17:30
<transcript>: Mutation.

04:17:34
<transcript>: Mutate async.

04:17:38
<transcript>: Aim ID is going to be game ID. Okay.

04:17:38
<transcript>: but this

04:17:42
<transcript>: But this is in use fact, we need to do.

04:17:46
<transcript>: Async function? Nit.

04:17:49
<transcript>: nitro

04:17:50
<transcript>: Nitro.

04:17:51
<transcript>: Nit.

04:17:54
<transcript>: Okay, ignore this.

04:17:56
<transcript>: I know better.

04:17:56
<transcript>: i don't

04:17:59
<transcript>: I don't want those infinite loops.

04:18:02
<transcript>: That one.

04:18:02
<transcript>: okay

04:18:05
<transcript>: Okay. Use the fact. Can I find it.

04:18:14
<transcript>: Art game so we want to do comps response equals.

04:18:14
<transcript>: await

04:18:15
<transcript>: Await.

04:18:19
<transcript>: Wait.

04:18:20
<transcript>: And then.

04:18:26
<transcript>: Let's see. So once we have that that's our round. Right.

04:18:26
<transcript>: start game mu

04:18:30
<transcript>: Start game mutation. Yeah yeah? Set round round.

04:18:30
<transcript>: okay

04:18:35
<transcript>: Okay. That's how it kicks it off. Oh, no, sorry. Response.

04:18:39
<transcript>: I guess I could just call that round.

04:18:48
<transcript>: And I the worst thing I did was install LSP saga, get used to it, and then get rid of it.

04:18:49
<transcript>: That's a big mistake.

04:18:53
<transcript>: Calf as you were gonna Rick, roll me. Thank you for waiting.

04:18:55
<transcript>: Thank you so much.

04:19:01
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow. Captain. Ashtar.

04:19:06
<transcript>: Okay, so we create the first round here when the game is initialized.

04:19:07
captainashtar: HeyGuys

04:19:12
<transcript>: Okay when we Hitle answer we check if there's no round.

04:19:19
<transcript>: And we return. If it's Loading, we return. Those should probably not just blankly return, but we're leaving for now.

04:19:24
<transcript>: Response. So we call them anthropoc.

04:19:29
<transcript>: And then we set the round.

04:19:29
<transcript>: what

04:19:30
<transcript>: What.

04:19:30
<transcript>: okay

04:19:32
<transcript>: Okay.

04:19:36
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

04:19:45
<transcript>: After a delay. Okay, so here. This is where things are gonna change. So now instead of answer image, it's going to be.

04:19:48
cowfacedude99: PRIME GOT THE BUTTON!!!!!!

04:19:58
<transcript>: If there's no round, like when this thing first starts up, there's no ramp on the game. First loads. We're gonna have to have some kind of Loading state. Otherwise, everything's just gonna be broken.

04:20:02
<transcript>: Before we didn't have that problem. Because we didn't we.

04:20:02
<transcript>: just

04:20:04
<transcript>: Just. Well, let's just do it right here.

04:20:06
<transcript>: If.

04:20:10
<transcript>: Not round.

04:20:12
<transcript>: Return.

04:20:18
<transcript>: Loading.

04:20:22
<transcript>: We'll make that better later. So now we know we have a round.

04:20:22
<transcript>: ro

04:20:24
<transcript>: Roundup answer image.

04:20:31
<transcript>: Round answer. Image. Is that right? Yeah. And then here.

04:20:35
<transcript>: Can't find name, answer.

04:20:35
<transcript>: the round

04:20:37
<transcript>: The round answer.

04:20:47
<transcript>: Let's just type resource.

04:20:52
<transcript>: Name.

04:20:55
<transcript>: Round I'll answer that name.

04:21:00
<transcript>: Round.

04:21:00
<transcript>: answer

04:21:01
<transcript>: Answer.

04:21:04
<transcript>: Name.

04:21:04
<transcript>: some

04:21:07
<transcript>: Some of this feels off. This is gonna be.

04:21:07
<transcript>: answer mu

04:21:09
<transcript>: Answer mutation.

04:21:09
<transcript>: that is

04:21:12
<transcript>: That is Loading. Okay.

04:21:14
<transcript>: This is kind of simpler.

04:21:14
<transcript>: on answer

04:21:17
<transcript>: On answer is not gonna do that. It's going to do.

04:21:20
<transcript>: Handle, answer.

04:21:33
<transcript>: Is there anything broken? Is that it? Did I fix it all? We refactored. We did it. Wait. Let's make sure.

04:21:33
<transcript>: let me do it

04:21:37
<transcript>: Let me do it. All right. Let's see if the game works. Let's see.

04:21:40
<transcript>: New game.

04:21:45
<transcript>: Loading. There it is. Okay, we're back.

04:21:45
<transcript>: make sure

04:21:48
<transcript>: Make sure I can answer stuff.

04:21:48
<transcript>: what is that

04:21:50
<transcript>: What is that? That's look out for metrics.

04:21:54
<transcript>: Oh, no, it's broken.

04:21:54
<transcript>: clicks

04:21:56
<transcript>: Clicks aren't working on the buttons.

04:21:56
<transcript>: why not

04:22:02
<transcript>: Why not when answer happens if not round return if any mutation is Loading return.

04:22:07
<transcript>: Otherwise we do that. So what are we seeing here in the console.

04:22:14
<transcript>: Mutation. Game start. I'm just calling game start repeatedly.

04:22:21
<transcript>: Oh, Geez, why are we calling game start repeatedly.

04:22:26
<transcript>: Because this gets called twice.

04:22:34
<transcript>: Right. We're calling start game mutation.

04:22:43
<transcript>: So when I click on one of these, is it just is it sending the wrong so hard to see.

04:22:45
<transcript>: Not enough room.

04:22:48
<transcript>: Prime got the button.

04:22:52
<transcript>: Oh, prime streaming. What button did he get.

04:22:52
<transcript>: oh what

04:22:58
<transcript>: Oh, what? Welcome to Chat, Captain Ash. Star. What button? What button? You got the button.

04:22:58
<transcript>: i don't know

04:23:02
<transcript>: I don't know what button you're talking about. I feel so out of the loop.

04:23:02
nexxeln: the orange theme is nice

04:23:11
<transcript>: I wanted to figure out why.

04:23:17
<transcript>: Game new and then game start.

04:23:22
<transcript>: And then.

04:23:28
<transcript>: My Cook on the button. Is it doing anything gayamed? Answer it's getting a response back. No.

04:23:32
<transcript>: Json Round Choice You can.

04:23:35
<transcript>: Round ID. Okay, so.

04:23:38
<transcript>: It is.

04:23:38
<transcript>: now

04:23:39
<transcript>: Now.

04:23:45
<transcript>: Yeah? Here we go? Json.

04:23:45
<transcript>: next

04:23:47
<transcript>: Next so it's got an extra round.

04:23:47
<transcript>: answer correct

04:23:51
<transcript>: Answer correct. False. Expired. True.

04:23:51
<transcript>: oh i'm

04:23:53
<transcript>: Oh, I'm waiting too long.

04:23:55
<transcript>: Okay. So I need to go faster.

04:23:55
<transcript>: so

04:24:01
<transcript>: So that's secrets, manager. It's got the thing on it before it should. There's still something broken. Clearly.

04:24:05
<transcript>: Clearly. Something broken.

04:24:11
<transcript>: So that was wrong.

04:24:14
<transcript>: Okay, we'll sort it out.

04:24:18
<transcript>: Let's do this one fast and look look out for metrics.

04:24:20
<transcript>: Clicking's not doing anything.

04:24:24
<transcript>: Just straight up not doing anything.

04:24:25
nexxeln: just do mutate not mutateAsync maybe?

04:24:33
<transcript>: Mutate. Note not mutate. Async is that my problem.

04:24:36
<transcript>: On Handle, answers.

04:24:36
<transcript>: i feel like i'm

04:24:37
<transcript>: I feel like I'm doing.

04:24:40
<transcript>: What do I missing? The super obvious here.

04:24:46
<transcript>: Handle, answer.

04:24:50
<transcript>: The choice.

04:24:50
<transcript>: there's

04:24:54
<transcript>: There's not a round. There should be a round. Right.

04:24:54
<transcript>: yeah

04:24:57
<transcript>: Yeah, we thought we always set round here.

04:25:01
<transcript>: So if answer mutation is Loading.

04:25:03
<transcript>: Turn.

04:25:03
<transcript>: let's just to prevent

04:25:14
<transcript>: Let's just to prevent you from double clicking right. We disable them. Okay, so that was wrong. It didn't show the correct one, though. There's definitely something. I'm making some assumptions with my state here that are wrong.

04:25:16
<transcript>: What is that? Resilient. Sub.

04:25:19
<transcript>: You're like right there? Clicks. Not working.

04:25:23
<transcript>: Is it clicking. It's just not.

04:25:23
<transcript>: consol

04:25:25
<transcript>: Console, log.

04:25:34
<transcript>: It's not clicking.

04:25:36
<transcript>: Handle, answer.

04:25:39
<transcript>: And will answer.

04:25:39
<transcript>: un

04:25:42
<transcript>: Unclick handle answer C name.

04:25:53
<transcript>: Function handling.

04:25:57
<transcript>: Did I save all my files.

04:25:58
cowfacedude99: my favorite kind of debugging

04:25:59
<transcript>: Oh, maybe not.

04:26:02
<transcript>: Maybe not.

04:26:06
<transcript>: Let's see. Okay. What is that.

04:26:09
<transcript>: Auto scaling fleas. I don't know.

04:26:09
<transcript>: it's not

04:26:15
<transcript>: It's not clicking. So why? Why can I not click? Is it because I've got the Dev tools open. Is there something wrong with.

04:26:15
<transcript>: so that works

04:26:16
<transcript>: So that works.

04:26:21
<transcript>: It was working earlier with the clicks.

04:26:24
<transcript>: That look awful. Snowball.

04:26:29
<transcript>: That one wasn't even hovering. Look at that.

04:26:32
<transcript>: Oh, we got some stuff to fix.

04:26:32
<transcript>: stuff to

04:26:38
<transcript>: Stuff to fix it's not showing the correct answer anymore. I don't know. I think we're at four and a half hours.

04:26:38
<transcript>: i'm getting into the

04:26:44
<transcript>: I'm getting into the part of the day where prime is streaming, and if I'm being honest, I kind of like to watch prime stream.

04:26:44
<transcript>: so

04:26:47
<transcript>: So I think it's time to call it for the day.

04:26:47
<transcript>: what's

04:26:48
<transcript>: What's.

04:26:52
<transcript>: Come over here. We made some progress today.

04:26:52
cowfacedude99: prime is streaming...

04:26:57
<transcript>: I definitely broke some things in the refactor. We had some of that stuff working.

04:26:57
<transcript>: and

04:27:04
<transcript>: And then we broke it when I refactored. So we'll get it all sorted out and we'll add the timer and we'll do all that. Hopefully tomorrow we can make a little more progress.

04:27:08
<transcript>: I'll get a little more serious about moving fast.

04:27:12
cowfacedude99: guess I will save my points.

04:27:13
laytanl_: Good stream, see ya!

04:27:16
<transcript>: Wow. It's been so good. I love streaming. I love coming back to it. I had a little vacation. I'm back. Feels really good.

04:27:16
<transcript>: i guess you'll

04:27:21
<transcript>: I guess you'll save your points. That's a good idea, cow face. Thanks, Laden. It was a good stream.

04:27:21
<transcript>: i really enjoyed

04:27:24
nexxeln: great stream

04:27:27
schrew: Speaking of progress, I've done 2 of my 10 peer reviews PoroSad

04:27:27
mhzrerfani: well done mate

04:27:31
<transcript>: I really enjoyed it. Be back tomorrow. I think there's a chance I don't stream tomorrow, so just a heads up. There's a chance I wake up and I say I need today to get some stuff done because I'm a little behind on some stuff.

04:27:35
<transcript>: Two of your ten peer reviews. Good job. True. You're getting there.

04:27:35
<transcript>: you're getting there

04:27:36
<transcript>: You're getting there.

04:27:36
<transcript>: so

04:27:39
<transcript>: So we'll see maybe maybe not tomorrow.

04:27:42
<transcript>: But you're the first to know.

04:27:46
<transcript>: Yeah. It's been great. Maybe we could do it sometime.
