<transcript>: Hello.

00:11:03
<transcript>: Did you all escape Twitter and make it over here? Twitch.

00:11:09
<transcript>: The ship? Is it sinking.

00:11:09
<transcript>: who has thoughts

00:11:13
<transcript>: Who has thoughts? What's thoughts? On twitter.com.

00:11:20
<transcript>: I think here's, my thought, I think.

00:11:20
<transcript>: it's

00:11:29
<transcript>: It's all baked in like, I don't think anybody surprised in Eli's inner circle. Elon's. Inner circle, I don't think.

00:11:36
<transcript>: I don't think they're that upset if there's some downtime, like I think for them.

00:11:36
<transcript>: i'm trying

00:11:41
<transcript>: I'm trying to look at this from Elon's perspective when he sent out that email, and he was like.

00:11:50
<transcript>: You know, you have to respond by whatever time, and it's gonna be hardcore. He had to know only a small percentage of employees would want to stick around.

00:11:50
<transcript>: given that email

00:11:52
<transcript>: Given that email.

00:11:53
<transcript>: And.

00:11:53
<transcript>: if

00:12:01
<transcript>: If Twitter goes down for a while and like we enter into some phase where there's outages the failure, that whole thing.

00:12:01
<transcript>: like from

00:12:21
<transcript>: Like, from his perspective. Maybe. And I'm not an Elon fan. I'm just I'm trying to, like, give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe it's like Twitter is pretty stale and stagnated. Like, from a social media landscape perspective. Twitter has been what it is for a long time. It's like journalists. There's a big tech community. There's, like communities that live on Twitter and thrive. But.

00:12:21
<transcript>: largely like

00:12:25
<transcript>: Largely like the numbers of Twitter, have been the same for a long time.

00:12:25
<transcript>: if

00:12:26
<transcript>: If.

00:12:26
<transcript>: we go through

00:12:32
<transcript>: We go through a bad period and like a lot of people leave because they're tired of outages or whatever.

00:12:32
<transcript>: then like

00:12:35
<transcript>: Then like if he's thinking he can rebuild something better.

00:12:35
<transcript>: and

00:12:39
<transcript>: And make it not 300 million subscribers.

00:12:39
<transcript>: or

00:12:44
<transcript>: Or users of Twitter, and like, grow it beyond that substantially. Then what.

00:12:44
<transcript>: 's a few months

00:12:47
<transcript>: 's a few months of a rough batch. I don't know. That's my perspective.

00:12:47
<transcript>: i love twitter

00:12:50
<transcript>: I love Twitter. I hope it doesn't go away.

00:12:50
<transcript>: i don't think

00:12:56
<transcript>: I don't think it will, but I do think there's probably going to be some technical issues you can't, like.

00:12:56
<transcript>: go

00:13:06
<transcript>: Go down to 10% of your staff and not have some hiccups, right? Is anyone even here? I just realized I'm talking. I've not seen a single chat message just talking to myself.

00:13:10
zviezdre: Yes!

00:13:12
<transcript>: Okay, good talk.

00:13:16
<transcript>: talkage

00:13:16
<transcript>: talkage zeb

00:13:20
<transcript>: Talkage. Zebie is here. Double it's here. No one is here.

00:13:20
<transcript>: welcome to

00:13:22
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Zavid.

00:13:25
<transcript>: I'm sorry I probably bash your name.

00:13:25
<transcript>: for

00:13:28
zviezdre: Thank you!

00:13:29
<transcript>: For months. Delveoid that's as long as I've been streaming, I think.

00:13:34
<transcript>: Alright.

00:13:41
<transcript>: I'm gonna stop talking about Twitter because the last thing anybody wants to talk about when they get on Twitch.

00:13:41
<transcript>: and they get away

00:13:45
<transcript>: And they get away from all the Twitter talk on Twitter is Twitter.

00:13:53
<transcript>: I'm gonna hopefully make more progress on AW, guess.

00:13:59
<transcript>: That's just. I'm just trying to get it done. Reinvent. Just like me. Nine days away now.

00:13:59
<transcript>: i'm gonna be flying

00:14:04
delvoid: i was just listening, i have no real opinion on it tbf

00:14:05
<transcript>: I'm gonna be flying to Vegas. Anybody here gonna be going to reinvent perchance.

00:14:05
<transcript>: so anybody

00:14:06
<transcript>: So anybody.

00:14:06
<transcript>: any of these

00:14:10
<transcript>: Any of these 25 viewers that I will see in Vegas.

00:14:16
<transcript>: Potentially. I was just listening. I've never opinion on it. To be fair. That's fair.

00:14:16
<transcript>: they'll lid i

00:14:19
<transcript>: They'll lid. I shouldn't have an opinion. It doesn't matter.

00:14:26
<transcript>: Not probably a good idea to have opinions about things that don't affect your life in any way, shape or form.

00:14:33
zviezdre: But it's good to rant sometimes

00:14:34
<transcript>: You're okay? I'm gonna take that as no. Nobody will be in Vegas.

00:14:34
<transcript>: anybody like

00:14:38
<transcript>: Anybody like live close to Vegas want to meet up.

00:14:38
<transcript>: it's

00:14:41
<transcript>: It's good to ran. Sometimes. That's right.

00:14:43
delvoid: i dont even have a passport LMAO

00:14:48
delvoid: sooo nope

00:14:49
zviezdre: At least 12 hours away from vegas.

00:14:51
<transcript>: Mostly I'm just sitting here until I finish this drink because it will go cold if I start working and it's sitting next to me. Don't even have a passport. Well, that's gonna be a blocker, I guess.

00:14:51
<transcript>: probably

00:14:53
<transcript>: Probably won't be a Vegas then.

00:14:53
<transcript>: twelve hours

00:14:56
<transcript>: 12 hours away from Vegas. Like driving.

00:14:56
<transcript>: you can

00:14:59
<transcript>: You can drive 12 hours to Vegas.

00:15:02
zviezdre: Flying

00:15:13
<transcript>: How long does it take me to drive? I drove to Vegas. Probably, like, 20 hours. Something like that. Flying. Oh, a twelve hour flight. Oof. You're along his way. Yeah, I forget. It's the middle of the night in the US. Nobody here. It's from the us.

00:15:15
<transcript>: Have a very international.

00:15:18
<transcript>: Circle of Friends here on Twitch.

00:15:27
<transcript>: Hello, Michigan on Fridays. I just streamed like four days in around.

00:15:28
zviezdre: Did you just wake up?

00:15:29
<transcript>: This is new for me.

00:15:29
<transcript>: this is

00:15:33
<transcript>: This is new. Did I just wake up? Yeah, it's been.

00:15:37
<transcript>: It's been like an hour. I actually got up like an hour ago.

00:15:37
<transcript>: but

00:15:42
zviezdre: What's the time there?

00:15:43
<transcript>: But that's basically just waking up for me like I've done nothing so far today.

00:15:43
<transcript>: i scrolled tw

00:15:47
<transcript>: I scrolled. Twitter. I do them scrolled. What's the time? There. It's 620.

00:15:47
<transcript>: six

00:15:49
<transcript>: 621.

00:15:49
<transcript>: a m

00:15:50
<transcript>: A. M.

00:15:57
zviezdre: Oh my god, you're a beast

00:16:01
<transcript>: All right. Can I manage to remember to drink my drink while I'm working.

00:16:06
cowfacedude99: I am bored :(. all the gcp exam prep is killing me :(

00:16:10
<transcript>: I'm a beast. Oh, I get up. Yeah, I get up early. I do wake early. I'm got a young family. I go to bed early. So that's not like I go on a little sleep. I just.

00:16:11
<transcript>: I.

00:16:11
<transcript>: go

00:16:14
<transcript>: Go to bed earlier. I wake up early.

00:16:14
<transcript>: catfish is here

00:16:16
phil_massicotte: Whats up everyone.

00:16:23
cowfacedude99: you should have a hydrate alert.

00:16:25
<transcript>: Catfish is here. You're bored. All the GCP exam prep is killing me. So the thing I do for that cow face when I was taking Certs is I just cram it into as few days as possible because it is boring.

00:16:25
<transcript>: and it's annoying

00:16:27
<transcript>: And it's annoying.

00:16:27
<transcript>: have

00:16:32
<transcript>: Have a Hydrate alert. That's a good idea. Like you guys can tell me. I need to hydrate.

00:16:32
<transcript>: with my

00:16:33
<transcript>: With my fake coffee.

00:16:33
<transcript>: so

00:16:35
whysodankness: early to bed and early to rise is a winning strategy

00:16:36
zviezdre: Do you have some fun sometimes also? Cold one with friends or something. Have to release the steam also.

00:16:41
<transcript>: So if I if you just study for two days and you just spend all day studying that's less days that you have to.

00:16:41
<transcript>: be studying

00:16:43
<transcript>: Be studying and be bored.

00:16:51
zviezdre: @WhySoDankness absolutely agree

00:16:53
<transcript>: Early to bed early to rise as a winning strategy. I think so, Dankness. I think so. Did you have some fun? Sometimes also do have some fun. Sometimes also could.

00:16:53
<transcript>: cold one with friends

00:16:57
cowfacedude99: can't do while on project :(

00:17:02
<transcript>: Cold one with friends or something have to release the steam. Also, you know, I don't really have friends around here. I've got a neighbor named Bin. He's my friend. We go for walks.

00:17:08
<transcript>: But mostly my work is my funds, and that's just kind of a deal. My wife and I have worked out.

00:17:08
<transcript>: she has

00:17:13
<transcript>: She has like a very hard job in taking care of my two young boys.

00:17:13
<transcript>: and

00:17:16
<transcript>: And in the sense.

00:17:21
<transcript>: This is the fun I get and then I'm helping her when I'm not in my office.

00:17:28
<transcript>: So, yeah, my work is my fun, and it works out because I really enjoyed watching what I do for work. So.

00:17:28
<transcript>: doing

00:17:38
cowfacedude99: rick roll you into working? LUL

00:17:44
<transcript>: Doing stuff on computers has been really fun for, like, 15 years, and I don't really need other hobbies. I do get into things on occasion. I got into mechanical keyboards for a bit. So I've got a few of those in the office that I like to tinker. I've got another one I gotta build. Actually, maybe we'll do that on stream. I'm no Teh.

00:17:46
<transcript>: But.

00:17:46
<transcript>: we could do

00:17:56
<transcript>: We could do a build straight. I could put one of my cameras face down, and we could I could build my next modes on it if we wanted to don't do it. Cafes. Don't do it. No cow, don't, don't recroll me.

00:17:59
<transcript>: This is such a weird transition.

00:18:04
<transcript>: Into the day, you know? It's like it feels like.

00:18:04
<transcript>: he

00:18:08
<transcript>: He didn't quite finish something you got really close and then like.

00:18:12
<transcript>: Not that I'm really accomplishing anything here. I'm just hanging out.

00:18:14
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:18:26
<transcript>: Can't do while on project? Oh, oh, I see. You've got other commitments. You can't just, like, Cramm it all into two days. Yeah, that makes sense. Most people can't just, like, take two days and do whatever they want.

00:18:30
<transcript>: So that's okay. So this is a topic that's been.

00:18:30
<transcript>: my

00:18:40
<transcript>: My wife and I've been talking about this a lot. And this is like my therapy. So I'm sorry if you don't want to listen to this, but my wife's been talking a lot. And my wife and I have been talking.

00:18:51
<transcript>: And I think I think she's I think it's hard for her to know I come down here and kind of do what I want every day, like I get to choose what I want to do.

00:18:51
<transcript>: and

00:18:52
<transcript>: And.

00:18:52
<transcript>: that

00:18:57
<transcript>: That. I think that's hard for her. She doesn't get to choose much of what she wants to do.

00:18:57
<transcript>: and

00:19:00
<transcript>: And I don't know the solution because.

00:19:20
<transcript>: I do get to choose what I want to do most days. Wrinkley, thank you so much for the follow. I do get to choose what I want to do. And but I also like, I have to I have to work or like, we don't have an income. And we've got quite a bit of money saved, like we could not work for a while. And that makes the conversation even harder because it's like.

00:19:20
<transcript>: i don't know

00:19:21
<transcript>: I don't know.

00:19:21
<transcript>: i don't know

00:19:23
<transcript>: I don't know.

00:19:36
<transcript>: And she knows I've got goals, like things that I want to do, I want to build. I want to, like, teach. I really want to teach people.

00:19:36
<transcript>: at the

00:19:38
<transcript>: At the stage of my career.

00:19:38
<transcript>: i said that

00:19:40
<transcript>: I said that on stream.

00:19:40
<transcript>: and

00:19:46
<transcript>: And she sees my weeks? And it's like, what did you do to move closer to.

00:19:46
<transcript>: building

00:19:47
<transcript>: Building.

00:19:47
<transcript>: some kind of

00:19:52
delvoid: im in a similar position with my misses

00:19:55
<transcript>: Some kind of a training business. Like, how am I gonna turn that into the thing that sustains us? And I just teach. And that's my focus.

00:20:00
<transcript>: You're in a similar position with your business. Okay, so this is not uncommon. I'm not the only one.

00:20:07
cowfacedude99: maybe write a book?

00:20:08
<transcript>: I think I just have a hard time. Like prioritize.

00:20:13
<transcript>: Realize maybe write a book. Write a book.

00:20:15
cowfacedude99: or a few?

00:20:16
<transcript>: I take forever to write.

00:20:21
<transcript>: I think I'm going to teach in video form because.

00:20:21
<transcript>: it takes

00:20:31
<transcript>: It takes me forever to write. I just like I get way too into the details and like, perfectionist. Like I spent forever writing a very small document.

00:20:31
<transcript>: because

00:20:39
<transcript>: Because I'll just, like, go over it over and over it. And I do the same thing with video. But I feel like I can just express my thoughts better.

00:20:42
<transcript>: Verbally vomit, then.

00:20:44
<transcript>: I can write them.

00:20:55
<transcript>: I'm almost done with my drink. We will start coding, and we'll start neovimming and building things shortly. For those that are tired of listening to me talk.

00:21:04
<transcript>: Yeah. I just I feel really guilty all the time about.

00:21:04
<transcript>: just about

00:21:06
<transcript>: Just about enjoying my work, you know.

00:21:06
<transcript>: i enjoy my

00:21:08
<transcript>: I enjoy my work.

00:21:08
<transcript>: and

00:21:09
<transcript>: And.

00:21:20
<transcript>: I've often said we should hire somebody. We have it times had a home assistant somebody that just helps with a lot of stuff around the house. We can afford to do it.

00:21:20
<transcript>: but

00:21:33
<transcript>: But that's kind of a weird dynamic. Like, then my wife has somebody else in the house. And like, it's just kind of like, you got to get to know that person. The kids have to get comfortable with that person. And we had somebody. And then she got pregnant and she had a baby. So she's not here anymore.

00:21:35
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:21:40
<transcript>: Okay. I'm gonna stop talking about my personal life and everything.

00:21:40
<transcript>: i'm seeing

00:21:42
<transcript>: I'm seeing through right now.

00:21:48
tommyluco: heyho everybody

00:21:49
<transcript>: And I'm gonna start building stuff. There's some more people here now anybody going to reinvent.

00:22:00
<transcript>: Will I be alone? I know Dacx is going. I don't know if he's here. My Daddy's here. Tommy's here. Hey, Ho, Tommy. Alright. Let's do it. Let's work on something.

00:22:05
<transcript>: Cold drinks be damned. I'll just drink all the drink. This thing cold.

00:22:10
<transcript>: All right.

00:22:10
<transcript>: so what i was

00:22:13
tommyluco: cold coffee?

00:22:15
<transcript>: So what I was trying to do yesterday, when I ended the stream offstream. Yeah, let's listen to music.

00:22:18
<transcript>: What I was trying to do.

00:22:18
<transcript>: is

00:22:19
zviezdre: That was an amazing transition anim

00:22:20
gigo6000: morning

00:22:24
<transcript>: Is set up persistence of my X state.

00:22:24
<transcript>: context

00:22:27
<transcript>: Context so I want to store my X state.

00:22:29
<transcript>: Machine.

00:22:31
cowfacedude99: before you start, can I interest you into a new plugin?

00:22:32
<transcript>: In local storage, so that.

00:22:50
<transcript>: Let's actually get hot. The hot module reload again right now. I can't really like save. I can't if I make a change to the file and I save the file, it completely resets the game state. I have to start over so I can't style things very easily. It's just maybe things really difficult.

00:22:55
cowfacedude99: https://github.com/folke/noice.nvim it is pretty crazy ui change.

00:22:55
<transcript>: Cold coffee. Yes, not the best cold coffee kind of sucks.

00:23:06
<transcript>: Amazing transition. I hear a lot of that. People. People are into the transition animations. In fact, anyone can create a transition animation on this stream. I forgot that's a feature here. It's a GitHub repo.

00:23:06
<transcript>: you can go in there

00:23:12
<transcript>: You can go in there and submit a pull request. You can see where some people have created some of these transitions.

00:23:12
<transcript>: and you can

00:23:19
<transcript>: And you can see that you get credit for it. So you'll get added. Whenever we use your transition, it chooses one randomly every time.

00:23:19
<transcript>: before you start can i

00:23:23
<transcript>: Before you start, can I interest you into a new plugin? Yes, you can. Cafe.

00:23:23
<transcript>: noise

00:23:24
<transcript>: Noise.

00:23:26
<transcript>: Envy. Is.

00:23:26
<transcript>: a pretty crazy

00:23:32
<transcript>: A pretty crazy UI change. Okay, let's see this. I love having you calf a here.

00:23:32
<transcript>: to in fact

00:23:45
<transcript>: To in fact, you know what, cow face? I love having you here so much. And it's hard to find people who are around. And I hate to do this because every time I do this like people stop showing up. But.

00:23:48
<transcript>: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it.

00:23:55
<transcript>: Calf as you're one of my new moderators. Thank you so much for all of your 999 plus messages.

00:23:59
<transcript>: But I love, I love that you provide these in Vim tips.

00:23:59
<transcript>: and

00:24:04
<transcript>: And such.

<transcript>: you always

00:24:16
tommyluco: really cool thanks @cowfacedude99 i'll check it out later. currently learning neovim

00:24:17
<transcript>: You always are adding to the stream. I appreciate you so much noise. So what does this do? Highly experimental plugin that can completely replaces the UI for messages, command line, and the popup menu. Okay. Does this work well with all of the other things I use? I guess. Like.

00:24:17
<transcript>: does it

00:24:19
<transcript>: Does it work with.

00:24:25
<transcript>: Don't I use CMP. Doesn't CMP do something? No, that's not this. I don't know. I don't know what I'm talking about.

00:24:28
cowfacedude99: it should.

00:24:38
<transcript>: Tommy is currently learning. Neil Vim, you can learn with us, Tommy. It should. Let's try it. Let's give it a go.

00:24:41
<transcript>: So here it is.

00:24:41
<transcript>: use

00:24:44
<transcript>: Use all that stuff requires.

00:24:44
<transcript>: i'm just gonna

00:24:47
<transcript>: I'm just gonna copy this. Exactly.

00:24:47
<transcript>: a suggested

00:24:48
<transcript>: A suggested setup.

00:24:58
<transcript>: This is the Packer set up right. If you LazyLoad any plugin below me, make sure to add proper module injuries. So new.

00:25:00
<transcript>: Do I need any of this.

00:25:02
<transcript>: Is only the.

00:25:08
<transcript>: If you want to use a notification view if not available, we use many as a followup.

00:25:08
<transcript>: what do you what

00:25:13
<transcript>: What do you what do you recommend here? Cafes? Do you just this default vanilla config here.

00:25:16
cowfacedude99: you need nui and nvim notify.

00:25:18
<transcript>: I need newly.

00:25:25
<transcript>: So I do need newly requires new. Okay. And then in the notify we'll just we'll do it just like they said here.

00:25:26
cowfacedude99: hte default is pretty nice

00:25:30
<transcript>: And then set up.

00:25:33
<transcript>: I guess we're I need to do the setup as well.

00:25:39
<transcript>: All Right, let's do it.

00:25:39
<transcript>: before we get into

00:25:40
<transcript>: Before we get into the.

00:25:45
<transcript>: Works for the day let's have some fun with me of him.

00:25:50
<transcript>: Okay. So I'm going to let's see. I've removed so many things.

00:25:54
<transcript>: To clean up this file and then push it.

00:25:54
<transcript>: let's just

00:25:59
<transcript>: Let's just paste that. So here we're gonna install a few things, I guess. Right.

00:26:01
<transcript>: Whoa.

00:26:01
<transcript>: was it doing

00:26:02
<transcript>: Was it doing.

00:26:02
<transcript>: okay

00:26:09
<transcript>: Okay. So we added noise newly and in vim notify cool. Now let's go into.

00:26:14
<transcript>: These.

00:26:17
<transcript>: Add proper module. What's that.

00:26:17
<transcript>: if you

00:26:20
<transcript>: If you LazyLoad any plugin below.

00:26:20
<transcript>: i

00:26:22
<transcript>: I think this is fine, right.

00:26:27
<transcript>: Require noise and I can add setup options here.

00:26:27
<transcript>: here's

00:26:29
<transcript>: Here's a recommended setup.

00:26:29
<transcript>: i

00:26:32
<transcript>: I typically do the.

00:26:32
cowfacedude99: I have it on the default and it is pretty nice.

00:26:39
<transcript>: Typically do the like separate file for each of my plugins. I'm not going to.

00:26:40
delvoid: setting up neovim is a pain

00:26:43
<transcript>: Since we're just triling this, I would say we're triling it.

00:26:51
<transcript>: So since we're just triling it, let's just in line. It like that.

00:26:51
<transcript>: see what we think

00:26:55
<transcript>: See what we think? Well, messages. I'm seeing it. Everything already up to date. Okay.

00:26:59
<transcript>: Let's see what it looks like.

00:27:02
<transcript>: Let's go back to.

00:27:02
<transcript>: where we're gonna

00:27:04
<transcript>: Where we're gonna be working.

00:27:09
<transcript>: Right. So if I do like in the oh, is it working.

00:27:09
<transcript>: should it have

00:27:14
<transcript>: Should it have replaced that the Telescope UI.

00:27:14
<transcript>: we think cafe

00:27:16
<transcript>: We think Cafe said, I do it.

00:27:18
<transcript>: I have it on the default and it's pretty nice.

00:27:27
<transcript>: Setting up near them as a pain. Yeah, it's.

00:27:27
<transcript>: a lab

00:27:31
<transcript>: A labor of love. It's just become a new hobby that I really enjoy.

00:27:31
<transcript>: where

00:27:32
cowfacedude99: it doesn't replace the telescope ui.

00:27:33
<transcript>: Where should I see this? I guess if I do like.

00:27:33
<transcript>: ooh

00:27:39
<transcript>: Ooh. Okay, notify no information available. Well, that's I don't need another. That.

00:27:43
<transcript>: Why is my Why is my thing flickering now? Oh, there it goes.

00:27:43
cowfacedude99: try something on command mode

00:27:45
<transcript>: Okay.

00:27:50
tommyluco: are you guys using any "wonky" layout or using default QWERTY?

00:27:52
<transcript>: What would these notify things be if there were information available? Thank you for the follow. Kiss My pixels.

00:27:56
<transcript>: Doesn't replace the telescope UI try something on command mode.

00:28:03
<transcript>: Are you guys using any wonky layout? Or do I just use quirty? Tommy, Tommy, I'm not that hardcore.

00:28:06
<transcript>: Try something. A command mode.

00:28:06
<transcript>: oh

00:28:08
cowfacedude99: @TommyLuco workman layout

00:28:09
<transcript>: Oh, oh, this is up here.

00:28:13
<transcript>: command line

00:28:14
<transcript>: Command line.

00:28:18
<transcript>: Wait. What is it? What did it do? So.

00:28:18
<transcript>: find normal

00:28:19
delvoid: i ended up trying a thing called astronvim

00:28:24
<transcript>: Find normal would be like if I want to run a command like that or I can do what's filter.

00:28:24
<transcript>: i'm trying

00:28:28
<transcript>: I'm trying to do exclamation Mark like if I want to run an arbitrary.

00:28:33
<transcript>: Oh, it worked. Okay, so there it popped up. Okay.

00:28:36
tommyluco: i have workman set up but i'm afraid to use it for neovim :D @cowfacedude99

00:28:40
<transcript>: This is different. It's different cafes. It's definitely different. I see what they're doing.

00:28:44
<transcript>: Oh Cafe uses workmen.

00:28:44
<transcript>: i ended up

00:28:48
tommyluco: so i constantly switch for that

00:28:50
<transcript>: I ended up trying a thing called Astro Vim, or Astro Env. I used Astro for a bit.

00:28:50
<transcript>: for like a day

00:28:51
<transcript>: For like a day.

00:28:53
cowfacedude99: @TommyLuco you would get used to  it pretty fast.

00:28:54
<transcript>: Oh.

00:29:00
<transcript>: Wow, Tommy. You switched from workmen to quiri for Neil. Them.

00:29:08
<transcript>: Okay. Let's see. So what are other commands that I run.

00:29:12
<transcript>: Does it have all this? Yeah. Okay.

00:29:14
<transcript>: So the command, that thing is nice.

00:29:17
<transcript>: This is nice.

00:29:25
gigo6000: Astronvim is awesome

00:29:28
<transcript>: I'm not crazy about, like, oh, I want to look at what this type is. I'm not crazy about the notify false alarms, like, no information available. That kind of bothers me.

00:29:35
<transcript>: And the flickering my cursor is flickering. It's like it's using so much of the I don't know what's going on.

00:29:39
<transcript>: I'm gonna turn it off for now, I think calf it.

00:29:39
<transcript>: astron

00:29:40
tommyluco: did you change your keybindings for neovim to match qwerty bindings so that it makes sense or did you use the vim-workman plugin? @cowfacedude99

00:29:41
<transcript>: Astronvin is awesome.

00:29:41
<transcript>: but

00:29:42
<transcript>: But.

00:29:42
<transcript>: i'm intrigued

00:29:46
<transcript>: I'm intrigued to follow along and see how this thing does.

00:29:52
<transcript>: Yeah, I want to see. I want to see where it head. I think that's a bug that it keeps saying no information available.

00:29:52
<transcript>: i don't think it

00:29:54
<transcript>: I don't think it should do that. Okay.

00:29:54
<transcript>: we're gonna dis

00:29:57
<transcript>: We're gonna disable it for now.

00:30:00
<transcript>: Let's just do.

00:30:00
cowfacedude99: j and k were a pain. but I started using c-n and c-p for going up and down.

00:30:01
gigo6000: specially for neovim noobs, I recently switched from vim to neovim

00:30:05
<transcript>: Okay.

00:30:29
<transcript>: Get up go, pilot. I might go back to.

00:30:32
<transcript>: I might go back to copilot at some point, so I'm gonna leave it in there.

<transcript>: Let's go back here.

00:30:44
<transcript>: I rebinded.

00:30:44
<transcript>: some

00:30:49
<transcript>: Some TMUK stuff. So that to watch this. Let's say I'm in a Nick.

00:30:58
<transcript>: And I've already got some other pains here that are like supporting pains. And I rebind it so that, oh, you can't see my keys.

00:30:58
<transcript>: i re

00:31:07
<transcript>: I rebinded some tmux to be just like my toggle term keeping. I mean, I have to do the T the tmux leader key, but like.

00:31:07
<transcript>: that way

00:31:16
<transcript>: That way when I try and reach for toggle term well for one toggle terms disabled. So that's not there. But I have to I just have to do it with that right.

00:31:18
<transcript>: It was good.

00:31:18
<transcript>: okay

00:31:19
<transcript>: Okay.

00:31:21
tommyluco: btw your alpha-blending is so smooth. i really like it!

00:31:30
<transcript>: Feels good. Feels good. By the way, your Alpha blending is so smooth. I really like it. Alpha blending.

00:31:30
<transcript>: you mean

00:31:39
tommyluco: green screen chroma key eyah

00:31:51
<transcript>: You mean the like my Chroma key, like my me sitting in front of my computer. I mean, setting on top of my screen with the Chroma key and the thing I actually mean by Alpha blending green screen coming here. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, man. I spent so much time. How many? How many streams cafes would know? Did I spend, like, tweaking.

00:31:51
<transcript>: chrome

00:31:54
<transcript>: Chrome every stream because it was just a little off.

00:32:05
<transcript>: It's. It sucked because like lighting if you don't have the lighting consistent. Like if I ever changed my lighting settings, am I Chroma Cube would be off and I have to re set up micromunkie. It's annoying.

00:32:05
<transcript>: did you

00:32:09
tommyluco: yeah and the smallest lighting change then its totally off

00:32:12
<transcript>: Did you change your key? Binding is for new of them to match credit bounties. Okay, you guys talk about stuff. Jk rap pain.

cowfacedude99: and is is still off on some scenes

00:32:22
<transcript>: Let's. Let's do this. Let's do this.

00:32:30
<transcript>: Is it working? No. So I was trying to like I said, I was trying to persist the state using local storage.

00:32:34
<transcript>: And we have an issue where.

00:32:37
<transcript>: Context is undefined.

00:32:42
<transcript>: I think I can just fix that issue. Context.

00:32:52
<transcript>: It, but I don't know if it's signs of a bad pattern. Like if I'm doing something, I shouldn't.

00:32:54
delvoid: what do you use for formatting?

00:32:58
<transcript>: I could just say like that right? Does that fix the issue, though.

00:33:04
<transcript>: There's more issues. So stop color. These are pretty innocuous. I could do it here.

00:33:07
<transcript>: Do that.

00:33:13
<transcript>: Then. I don't know, though. Is this a bad? Is it just signs of a bad thing? Oh, what's all this.

00:33:17
<transcript>: Auth session is erroring.

00:33:20
<transcript>: Unexpected token. What's happening.

00:33:20
delvoid: i tried to get eslint and prettier to work and it wouldnt play nice so i stopped using nvim xD

00:33:24
<transcript>: What is going on? I've never noticed these before. Have these always been.

00:33:27
<transcript>: Unexpected token.

00:33:33
<transcript>: So next author some issues is that since I went to NEX 13 I wonder.

00:33:36
<transcript>: How.

00:33:41
<transcript>: Okay.

00:33:45
cowfacedude99: @adamdotdev there's this but I haven't used it for a while. https://github.com/preservim/vimux

00:33:49
<transcript>: all of my

00:33:53
<transcript>: All of my dependencies I wonder if there's an issue here with TrpC.

00:33:59
<transcript>: Let's try just restarting the server.

00:34:03
<transcript>: Let's try that.

00:34:18
<transcript>: Is still off on some scenes. Yeah, yeah Crumb key.

00:34:18

00:34:22
<transcript>: It doesn't work with some filters for sure.

00:34:22
<transcript>: what do i use for

00:34:24
<transcript>: What do I use for formatting? It's just prettier D.

00:34:24
<transcript>: try to

00:34:28
<transcript>: Try to get you a slant and prettier to work and it wouldn't play nice. I stopped you.

00:34:28
<transcript>: yeah

00:34:32
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't use ESLint anymore. I'm just using prettier.

00:34:34
<transcript>: There's this.

00:34:34
<transcript>: preserve

delvoid: @JensWoeste Heyooo buddy

00:37:14
<transcript>: What is this issue? Somebody had it in 2020. Maybe there's a simple explanation. Make sure that you ran Prisma Generate after you deleted the Prism folder. Otherwise the code won't be there in. The error is expected. Oh, okay.

00:37:14
<transcript>: that seems

00:37:16
<transcript>: That seems.

00:37:18
<transcript>: Simple enough.

00:37:18
<transcript>: prism

00:37:22
<transcript>: Prisma. Would it be PMPM Run Prisma.

00:37:25
<transcript>: Does not generate something like that.

00:37:30
<transcript>: Missing script. Prisma. Okay, no, that's not how you do that.

00:37:31

<transcript>: I don't believe you.

00:41:36
ohmymndy: HeyGuys

00:41:38
<transcript>: Pnpm, run Dev, let's see.

00:41:42
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:41:47
<transcript>: Oh, did it work.

00:41:49
<transcript>: Did it work.

00:41:53
<transcript>: Ah, nice. Uneventful. That's what I like to see.

00:41:55
<transcript>: Okay. So.

00:41:58
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

00:41:58
<transcript>: i

00:42:05
<transcript>: I don't know how much I like what I've done here. I don't know why context is sometimes undefined. Now. It never was before.

00:42:05
<transcript>: something

00:42:08
<transcript>: Something about persisting. Let's see.

00:42:11
<transcript>: I don't want to keep.

00:42:15
<transcript>: I don't want to keep just what.

00:42:28
<transcript>: I don't want to keep putting bandaids on this context issue and just adding like question marks everywhere. I think what I want to do.

00:42:33
<transcript>: Let's see, let's remove.

00:42:36
<transcript>: This. I'm.

00:42:36
<transcript>: weird

00:42:42
<transcript>: Weird in my end M lately it's like taking me all over the buffer when I'm trying to undo some stuff.

00:42:44
<transcript>: Okay.

00:42:44
<transcript>: read it

00:42:56
<transcript>: Read it out. So here we are. We've got context is undefined and at times and it could be because I'm using local storage value default value gain machine initial state.

00:42:59
<transcript>: What if we said.

00:43:04
ohmymndy: Are you using Dracula Pro Adam? I bought it yesterday, it is absolutely worth the money

00:43:08
<transcript>: What if we said context.

00:43:15
<transcript>: Here? No. Here.

00:43:17
<transcript>: Current.

00:43:17
<transcript>: how do

00:43:21
<transcript>: How do I default? That what's a good sense of syntax for defaulting. It.

00:43:21
<transcript>: i could just

00:43:23
<transcript>: I could just do this.

00:43:26
<transcript>: Dot, context.

00:43:26
<transcript>: and then

00:43:28
<transcript>: And then default. It like that.

00:43:33
<transcript>: Follow that who's mad? Who's mad? About this.

00:43:35
<transcript>: Mandy's, here.

00:43:35
<transcript>: oh my word

00:43:37
<transcript>: Oh, my word, it's Mandy.

00:43:37
<transcript>: i guess it was

00:43:50
<transcript>: I guess it was also here. It's Mandy. That's. Who's here? Are you using Dracula Pro Atom? I bought it yesterday is absolutely worth money. Oh, what is the difference? I feel like I may be paid for it a long time ago, but I don't know if I actually use it because I just use all the Dracula plugs that are in everything.

00:43:56
<transcript>: But I feel like I did pay for it once. Can you explain to me what you get when you buy Jack Dracula pro.

00:43:59
<transcript>: Context is undefined.

00:44:06
<transcript>: Timing to update undefined context.

00:44:14
ohmymndy: Dracula pro has a couple of variants and also has the exact same theme for all your editors and terminal emulators

00:44:23
<transcript>: Dracula Pro. I know I paid for it one time. Jackie lepros a couple of variants and also has the exact same theme for all your Editors and terminal emulators. Okay.

00:44:28
<transcript>: Interesting. Yeah. Let me. Dracula pro.

00:44:31
ohmymndy: For me it is a bit better because it has some more contrast

00:44:31
<transcript>: I'm pretty sure I paid for it one time. How would I know.

00:44:40
<transcript>: Wow. I've sold $268,000 worth of Dracula Pro. Not bad for Six colors.

00:44:52
<transcript>: I do love Dracula.

00:44:58
<transcript>: Dragula pro.

00:45:02
<transcript>: So if I get it now kind of like login and see.

00:45:07
<transcript>: If I already bought it once.

00:45:11
<transcript>: I'd be in my email, I guess let me go fuzzy.

00:45:11
<transcript>: and

00:45:11
ohmymndy: You can go to gumroad to see if it is on your account?

00:45:13
<transcript>: And I will.

00:45:13
<transcript>: check

00:45:14
<transcript>: Check.

00:45:14
<transcript>: i'm curious

00:45:15
<transcript>: I'm curious.

00:45:21
<transcript>: Go to Gum Road to see if it's on your account. Yeah, if I know what my.

00:45:21
<transcript>: if i

00:45:23
<transcript>: If I know what my.

00:45:23
<transcript>: gum wrote

00:45:25
<transcript>: Gum wrote account is.

00:45:31
<transcript>: Let's see. Dracula. Pro.

00:45:35
<transcript>: On that email.

00:45:43
<transcript>: I'm assuming I would have got an email that said Dracula Pro in it.

00:45:49
<transcript>: Maybe not. I guess I didn't buy Jacob Pro. I will look into this. Mandy.

00:45:55
<transcript>: I love Dracula. I wouldn't mind just giving them my money because I love Dracula. And supporting them. Sounds good.

00:45:57
<transcript>: It's kind of why I did the Twitter Blue thing.

00:45:57
<transcript>: there we go

00:46:00
<transcript>: There we go. Okay.

00:46:00
<transcript>: let's see

00:46:05
<transcript>: Let's see. So what's wrong here? Undefined. So I'm trying to persist.

00:46:05
<transcript>: trying to persist

00:46:07
<transcript>: Trying to persist the context.

00:46:09
<transcript>: Let's. Let's do this. Let's say.

00:46:09
<transcript>: consol

00:46:12
<transcript>: Console, log.

00:46:14
<transcript>: Initial step.

00:46:23
<transcript>: Context is undefined.

00:46:30
<transcript>: Oh. Because I'm actually. I'm actually. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So what if I did this? What if I said.

00:46:33
<transcript>: Game machine initial state.

00:46:38
<transcript>: So here I'm passing it in. Let's do this.

00:46:38
<transcript>: what if i

00:46:41
<transcript>: What if I said, here.

00:46:43
<transcript>: Okay.

00:46:43
<transcript>: let's undo

00:46:44
<transcript>: Let's undo.

00:46:51
<transcript>: This stuff. Let's just deconstruct it like that. But what if I said, here.

00:46:51
<transcript>: what if what if i

00:46:53
<transcript>: What if. What if I did this.

00:46:56
<transcript>: Like I said, Dotta, dot.

00:46:56
<transcript>: i deconstruct

00:46:58
<transcript>: I deconstruct that. And then.

00:47:03
<transcript>: I deconstruct that. And then I say.

00:47:03
<transcript>: context

00:47:05
<transcript>: Context.

00:47:05
<transcript>: is

00:47:09
<transcript>: Is initial state, context, context, or.

00:47:11
<transcript>: Like that.

00:47:15
<transcript>: Things are followed Beekey.

00:47:24
<transcript>: Thank you for that. Follow. What did I do here? I did something dumb state type context. What object is possibly undefined.

00:47:30
<transcript>: Should always be.

00:47:30
<transcript>: i think should

00:47:32
<transcript>: I think should always have a value.

00:47:32
<transcript>: is what i'm trying

00:47:34
<transcript>: Is what I'm trying to say.

00:47:41
<transcript>: Oh, but maybe that's not a good context. Maybe it can't just be an empty state upset.

00:47:44
<transcript>: Context, context.

00:47:49
<transcript>: Not a sign of a bullet type.

00:47:50
<transcript>: types of property

00:47:50
<transcript>: types of property value

00:47:52
<transcript>: Types of property value or incompatible.

00:47:54
<transcript>: What.

00:47:54
<transcript>: stake value

00:47:58
<transcript>: Stake value or undefined is not assignable to type state value. Type undivised.

00:48:02
<transcript>: Where's the state value where is that supposed to be.

00:48:05
<transcript>: Value, state value, or undefined.

00:48:14
<transcript>: Who's done this? I feel like somebody's done this. X state.

00:48:14
<transcript>: persists

00:48:15
<transcript>: Persists.

00:48:15
<transcript>: eight

00:48:16
<transcript>: Eight.

00:48:21
<transcript>: I've looked at this.

00:48:28
<transcript>: They purchased Persistence between sessions.

00:48:37
<transcript>: Local stories get on state yeah, Yeah.

00:48:37
<transcript>: okay

00:48:39
<transcript>: Okay, that doesn't help.

00:48:41
<transcript>: Extate.

00:48:41
<transcript>: persist

00:48:43
<transcript>: Persisting state.

00:48:49
<transcript>: As mentioned, the state object can be persisted by serializing it to a JSON string format.

00:48:49
<transcript>: okay

00:48:50
<transcript>: Okay. I'm doing that.

00:48:56
<transcript>: Am I wait. Am I doing that? Am I actually serializing it? Or am I just.

00:49:02
<transcript>: Set. Let's see persist state.

00:49:08
<transcript>: I'm just passing in. Oh, I'm not serializing it. Oh, I'm not serializing it.

00:49:12
<transcript>: Straight.

00:49:14
<transcript>: What.

00:49:18
<transcript>: Can I spell it wrong? What did I do.

00:49:23
rudixworld: Hello

00:49:24
<transcript>: If strings? Perimeter next state Oh.

00:49:28
<transcript>: Persist state.

00:49:28
<transcript>: i guess

00:49:30
<transcript>: I guess default value.

00:49:30
<transcript>: here

00:49:33
<transcript>: Here. I got to do the same thing.

00:49:36
<transcript>: Right.

00:49:43
ohmymndy: Do you use Ctrl+c or escape to exit insert mode @adamdotdev  ?

00:49:48
<transcript>: Now does that work? No. Oh, yeah, yeah. I gotta do it right here. Json stringify.

00:49:57
<transcript>: And then just ignore this whole thing we need to do. State initial state.

00:50:00
<transcript>: Doesn't like that now. Oh, okay.

00:50:04
<transcript>: So json.com? Parse.

00:50:07
<transcript>: But wait a minute.

00:50:07
<transcript>: wait

00:50:09
<transcript>: Wait a minute.

00:50:18
<transcript>: Why would this.

00:50:27
<transcript>: I think this thing does use local store does. I already does a JSON string five for you so I don't think I need to do this. That was all done.

00:50:27
<transcript>: how's all done

00:50:30
<transcript>: How's all done? Go do it. Undo, undo, undue.

00:50:39
<transcript>: Like I think this hook already does it. It does a JSON string of I that's the whole point.

00:50:47
<transcript>: So I'm trying to save a JSON. String, which I'm doing successfully. Let's try. Let's change the key.

00:50:47
<transcript>: let's

00:50:51
<transcript>: Let's change this key in case there's like a bad.

00:50:54
<transcript>: Thing persisted in there right now.

00:51:03
<transcript>: They can be restored using the static create method. So maybe I need to do this. You state creates restore state from a plane object. Oh, I need to do this.

00:51:11
<transcript>: So state create to restore state from a plane object. So down here.

00:51:11
<transcript>: where is that

00:51:12
<transcript>: Where is that.

00:51:12
<transcript>: down

00:51:14
<transcript>: Down.

00:51:14
<transcript>: here

00:51:17
<transcript>: Here. Oh, I didn't do everything Oops.

00:51:24
<transcript>: Okay. Right here.

00:51:30
<transcript>: Eight equals state.

00:51:31
rudixworld: I was wondering how to pass props to layout.tsx with Next 13 ... decided to play with it today

00:51:36
<transcript>: And then that's going to be the initial.

00:51:39
<transcript>: Initial state.

00:51:41
<transcript>: Right.

00:51:49
<transcript>: Oh, it could be undefined.

00:51:49
<transcript>: okay

00:51:51
<transcript>: Okay.

00:52:01
<transcript>: Hype is missing the following properties. It's got to be.

00:52:01
<transcript>: oh

00:52:04
<transcript>: Oh, well, is that what they did.

00:52:07
<transcript>: They do this or.

00:52:11
<transcript>: Jane Machine Initial state.

00:52:14
<transcript>: That work.

00:52:17
<transcript>: Then I don't need to do.

00:52:23
<transcript>: This one. Here the default value. Or maybe I do. I don't know.

00:52:28
<transcript>: But hey, this might work.

00:52:28
<transcript>: is now

00:52:31
<transcript>: Is now that we're doing state create.

00:52:31
<transcript>: it's my work

00:52:32
<transcript>: It's my work.

00:52:35
<transcript>: Let's try it.

00:52:37
ohmymndy: Oh I see you are using Escape, have you remapped your escape key to make that easier? My caps lock is now my esc key :-)

00:52:38
<transcript>: It might not work.

00:52:46
<transcript>: Let's see. Hello, rudics, do you use ctrlC or escape to exit insert mode. I use escape.

00:52:46
<transcript>: mandy

00:52:57
devinda_me: how do you code in the morning's @adamdotdev

00:53:00
<transcript>: Mandy which is I have bound to caps lock. I was wondering how to pass props to layout. Tsx with Next 13 decided to play with it today. I don't think you can pass props to layout because the layout is like a page, right.

00:53:07
<transcript>: You could do like can you do fetches using the new data fetching in a layout.

00:53:09
<transcript>: You can probably do that.

00:53:09
<transcript>: it's like

00:53:14
<transcript>: It's like SSR, your layout, but I don't think you can. I don't think you pass props into it.

00:53:14
<transcript>: i guess that

00:53:17
booptybapty: how do you bind escape to capslock

00:53:18
<transcript>: I guess that would be passing props into it is using fetching.

00:53:18
<transcript>: so like

00:53:19
<transcript>: So like.

00:53:19
<transcript>: let's see

00:53:22
<transcript>: Let's see next day 13.

00:53:22
<transcript>: app direction

00:53:23
<transcript>: App direction.

00:53:27
<transcript>: Here we go.

00:53:36
<transcript>: Explore the new App directory.

00:53:44
<transcript>: Let's see. Do any of the layouts in this one? Let's look at this repo here.

00:53:46
<transcript>: App.

00:53:46
<transcript>: let's see

00:53:48
<transcript>: Let's see. Let's just look at the first layout.

00:53:52
<transcript>: No fetching in here. I guess I could just search in the repo.

00:53:57
<transcript>: Fetch. Let's find all the cases. We're fetching it's happening. There's a page where they said.

00:53:57
<transcript>: maybe

00:53:59
<transcript>: Maybe.

00:54:02
<transcript>: Ssr ID.

00:54:02
<transcript>: these are

00:54:04
<transcript>: These are pages. Can you fetch.

00:54:04
<transcript>: in a

00:54:08
<transcript>: In a layout file. I assume you can. Yeah. Here we go.

00:54:08
<transcript>: so here

00:54:10
<transcript>: So here.

00:54:10
<transcript>: app layout

00:54:11
<transcript>: App layouts.

00:54:11
<transcript>: layout

00:54:12
rudixworld: yeah but if I cannot pass something like ID it's no use to fetch something dynamic

00:54:13
<transcript>: Layout TSX.

00:54:16
<transcript>: So here they're doing.

00:54:24
<transcript>: This layout gets children. Wait a bit. This is just a component. This isn't actually a no, it's layout. Tsx.

00:54:28
<transcript>: So layouts can get children.

00:54:32
<transcript>: Yeah? Oh, yeah? Of course they render the children.

00:54:32
<transcript>: that's the whole thing

00:54:32
blakegreendev: I joined to see if you were rewriting your VTL templates with the new JS resolvers lol

00:54:36
<transcript>: That's the whole thing. Yeah. So these I think that's probably the only prop you can get in it. But then you can do fetching.

00:54:36
<transcript>: if you need

00:54:39
<transcript>: If you need data, you know I'm saying.

00:54:47
<transcript>: You're using Escape page. Have you remapped your escape key to make that easier, my cat's left. Yep, Yep, Yep. That's what I do. Mandy.

00:54:47
<transcript>: da vinda

00:54:56
<transcript>: Da Vinda. How do you code in the mornings? Animal Dev. I only code in the mornings. It's my. It's the time when I come alive the morning time.

00:54:56
<transcript>: i'm a morning

00:54:58
<transcript>: I'm a morning person.

00:54:58
<transcript>: if that's a thing

00:55:00
<transcript>: If that's a thing.

00:55:00
<transcript>: some people say

00:55:11
<transcript>: Some people say everybody should be a morning person. I don't know if that's true. Welcome to Chat Boop D Bapti. How do you bind Escape to Capslock? I do it in the macOS like keyboard settings. I use a Mac.

00:55:15
<transcript>: Yeah, but if I cannot pass something like.

00:55:20
<transcript>: Why is that Pin button over your text? I can't remember text.

00:55:23
<transcript>: Get out of here. What is this.

00:55:23
<transcript>: okay there we go

00:55:24
<transcript>: Okay. There we go.

00:55:29
<transcript>: Now I just mess up my window.

00:55:29
<transcript>: if

00:55:35
<transcript>: If I cannot pass something like ID. It's not. It's no use to fetch something dynamic.

00:55:35
<transcript>: oh

00:55:36
<transcript>: Oh Oh.

00:55:45
<transcript>: Blake joined to see if I was rewriting my details templates with the new Jspbers. I do want to play with that. I'm Blake. I'm in the middle of trying to finish. Aw, guess.

00:55:56
<transcript>: And I want to finish it for reinvent. So this project's not even using VTL so I have nothing to rewrite, but I do want to play with it really badly thought about streaming on that today or making a video about it.

00:56:00
ohmymndy: My Kinesis Advantage has the option to remap keys, so I did it on my keyboard. On Windows you might be able to use AutoHotkey for that, not sure how you would do that on a Mac. On Linux you can use some keyboard config for that xkb, xmodmap...

00:56:02
rudixworld: I am pretty sure expect {children } layout also accept {props} ... looking in the docs

00:56:04
<transcript>: So if you cannot pass any like ID it's no use of it. So yeah you have a good point if your layout is inside of like a dynamic.

00:56:04
<transcript>: page where you

00:56:06
<transcript>: Page where you should be able to get like.

00:56:06
<transcript>: param

00:56:10
<transcript>: Params like this. It's probably similar to this. Right.

00:56:10
<transcript>: it's

00:56:13
<transcript>: It's probably similar. You probably get a params.

00:56:15
<transcript>: That's.

00:56:15
<transcript>: par

00:56:22
<transcript>: Params. On the layout. Props? Is there a layout? Props? Next. Js. 13. Layout. Props.

00:56:26
<transcript>: Just guessing. Guessing. There's a layouts, props.

00:56:28
<transcript>: Examples.

00:56:33
<transcript>: This is a layout. No. That's importing a layout.

00:56:36
<transcript>: Oh, well, wait.

00:56:37
rudixworld: params actually you might be right

00:56:41
<transcript>: Custom app. Oh, you don't need to have that per page layout.

00:56:44
rudixworld: docs are mess :(

00:56:53
<transcript>: This is the. Is this the old layouts? This is the old way of doing layouts. Yeah. Here we go. Colake, colocated.

00:56:55
<transcript>: Data fetching.

00:57:00
<transcript>: The new docs. Of course. Beta. Next. Js.org. I should have been here.

00:57:01
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:57:07
<transcript>: So let's go to is there docs on just layer pages and layouts. Here we go.

00:57:16
<transcript>: So layouts share between multiple pages navigation layouts preserve state remain interactive can also be nested.

00:57:16
<transcript>: so

00:57:19
<transcript>: So here they get children.

00:57:27
<transcript>: Is there. In a case where the topmost is called the root layout, any route segment can optionally define its own layout. These options.

00:57:27
<transcript>: so

00:57:32
<transcript>: So how do you get the props in a route that has.

00:57:32
<transcript>: props

00:57:33
<transcript>: Props.

00:57:33
<transcript>: laughing

00:57:36
<transcript>: Laughing about are nested by default.

00:57:45
<transcript>: These route groups to opt specific graphites in and out of shared layouts. Layouts are server components for default can be set to apply components. Layout can fetch data.

00:57:51
<transcript>: Not possible to pass data between apparent layout and its children. However, you can fetch the same data.

00:57:51
<transcript>: interact more

00:57:52
<transcript>: Interact more than once.

00:57:59
<transcript>: So here's a root layout. They just show children nesting layouts. Where do we get some params.

00:58:08
<transcript>: Where do you get some Paran's? I would imagine it's the same as in a page, but I'd love to see.

00:58:08
<transcript>: that

00:58:10
<transcript>: That example.

00:58:23
<transcript>: Let's see what's says Layout JS is a show props. Oh, here we go. Params optional. There it is. It's just a params prop. There you are.

00:58:25
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:58:25
<transcript>: who asked that

00:58:26
<transcript>: Who asked that.

00:58:32
<transcript>: Who asked that was that.

00:58:32
<transcript>: ruce

00:58:33
<transcript>: Ruce? Is that you.

00:58:36
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. Really.

00:58:41
<transcript>: Sure. Expect children layout also accept props. Yeah, Yeah.

00:58:41
<transcript>: that's it

00:58:45
rudixworld: yeah url pls

00:58:52
<transcript>: That's it. You can you get children that's required to always have children. You can optionally have params if there's dynamic right parameters. And then you can use that to do your datasetching.

00:58:52
<transcript>: url

00:58:54
<transcript>: Url.

00:58:54
<transcript>: sorry about that

00:58:55
<transcript>: Sorry about that.

00:58:57
adamdotdev: https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/file-conventions/layout

00:58:59
<transcript>: Here, you've rudix.

00:59:05
<transcript>: Alright I am I've upgraded to the next 13 in this AWS project.

00:59:05
<transcript>: we'll see

00:59:07
<transcript>: We'll see if I.

00:59:07
<transcript>: use any of the

00:59:08
blakegreendev: Oh I forgot you switched back to awsguess… the bitter project has VTL right?

00:59:10
<transcript>: Use any of the app directory stuff right now. I'm not.

00:59:14
<transcript>: So what's the problem here? The problem is.

00:59:16
<transcript>: We got problems.

00:59:16
<transcript>: the

00:59:18
<transcript>: The problem is.

00:59:23
<transcript>: Context is no.

00:59:26
<transcript>: When I try to persist, it.

00:59:26
<transcript>: when i try to persist

00:59:29
<transcript>: When I try to persist, it.

00:59:32
<transcript>: We could just say.

00:59:32
<transcript>: if there's

00:59:35
<transcript>: If there's no context, let's try this.

00:59:35
<transcript>: hear me

00:59:38
<transcript>: Hear me out if.

00:59:38
<transcript>: not

00:59:40
<transcript>: Not context.

00:59:41
<transcript>: Return.

00:59:44
<transcript>: Loading.

00:59:49
<transcript>: Sometimes I make myself laugh. Loading.

00:59:52
<transcript>: Is it ever gonna? Is it ever gonna happen.

00:59:56
<transcript>: I'm just gonna keep not having a context.

01:00:00
<transcript>: Oh, well.

01:00:03
<transcript>: Current.

01:00:09
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the follow.

01:00:11
<transcript>: Salah.

01:00:15
blakegreendev: Are you hosting on Amplify? So many pre:Invent goodness

01:00:15
<transcript>: Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well.

01:00:22
<transcript>: I forgot you switch back to AWS.

01:00:42
<transcript>: The Bitter project does have VTL. That's right. Yeah. Blake, I could do that on the bidder projects. We could write those in JS. That'll be fun. Maybe that'll be next week. If I get this done soon. Are you hosting on Amplify? So many preinvent goodness. Oh, did Amplify do the next JS? Did they announce that I've talked about it because I'm terrible at not leaking things. But did amplify amplify next to us? Did they.

01:00:42
<transcript>: announce

01:00:47
<transcript>: Announce the next gift, like hosting full support for next year. Did they do that.

01:00:47
<transcript>: yeah

01:00:49
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:00:49
<transcript>: they did it

01:00:50
<transcript>: They did it.

01:00:55
<transcript>: I didn't know that was coming out yesterday. I knew it was coming. I didn't know it was coming out yesterday.

01:00:55
<transcript>: host

01:01:01
rudixworld: wow

01:01:01
blakegreendev: They support next13

01:01:03
<transcript>: Hosting announced Next Race Twelve and 13 Sport Your app can take advantage of Next chest features, including serverside rendering API Route Middleware Incremental. Storage.

01:01:12
<transcript>: Featuresport and fly hosting is improving experience, faster, builds cloud watch integration, or seems to implement backends.

01:01:12
<transcript>: yeah i'm excited about

01:01:20
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm excited about this because I think if I can take advantage of just amplify hosting and build my own APIs, my own backends without having to use amplify for that.

01:01:20
<transcript>: i'll be even more

01:01:23
<transcript>: I'll be even more excited, which I assume that's the case.

01:01:23
<transcript>: thank you for the following

01:01:24
<transcript>: Thank you for the following.

01:01:32
<transcript>: Yeah. So I think they're just, like, right next in containers. Now.

01:01:32
<transcript>: so there's

01:01:39
<transcript>: So there's they're always gonna have full feature parity with whatever. Next. It's the same way. Like Netlify works. Right. And obviously for so.

01:01:39
<transcript>: with your

01:01:42
rudixworld: I already hosted on Cloudflare :(

01:01:45
<transcript>: With your app push to a Git provider, you're ready to deploy to MFI hosting, start visiting employee console.

01:01:45
<transcript>: so this is

01:01:47
<transcript>: So this is like a genuine.

01:01:47
<transcript>: sk

01:01:48
blakegreendev: Yeah Michael Liendo has a great post on it

01:01:55
<transcript>: Skatepatch from Versailles if you're somebody who likes to build with Next JS that you like to build your APIs and AWS, this is really, really good news.

01:02:01
<transcript>: Does it have like integration with cloud formation.

01:02:10
<transcript>: Like how can I wonder how I can use my existing tooling.

01:02:10
<transcript>: to host

01:02:12
<transcript>: To host on.

01:02:12
<transcript>: amplify

01:02:14
devinda_me: no <Image /> support i guess

01:02:15
<transcript>: Amplify hosting without having to like go to the console or something.

01:02:15
<transcript>: you know i'm saying

01:02:16
<transcript>: You know, I'm saying.

01:02:20
blakegreendev: Like create an Amplify app with CDK with the rest of the backend

01:02:23
<transcript>: It's possible.

01:02:35
<transcript>: Do I have to use all the Amplify, CI CD stuff.

01:02:35
<transcript>: like the github

01:02:37
<transcript>: Like the GitHub.

01:02:37
<transcript>: hook

01:02:41
<transcript>: Hook and all this stuff. I wonder if I have to do that or if I can just push.

01:02:41
<transcript>: i don't know

01:02:44
<transcript>: I don't know I'd love to see.

01:02:44
<transcript>: like the

01:02:47
<transcript>: Like the ability to push into this thing with coffee.

01:02:49
shiftlessatol: remember that time I said, "They should make Javascript for the backend", and you said, " How would they do that? Javascript is a client-side scripting language..."  And now here we are!

01:02:52
<transcript>: No image support? Why not the Venda? I think it's got everything. Support.

01:02:52
<transcript>: think

01:02:55
<transcript>: Think it's like full feature parody.

01:02:58
blakegreendev: No you don’t

01:02:58
<transcript>: Already hosted on Cloudfare.

01:02:58
<transcript>: yeah

01:03:00
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:03:09
<transcript>: So I generally just host my next Shape apps on Pursuit. Thanks for the follow. Hot, hot, dense.

01:03:09
<transcript>: mic

01:03:12
<transcript>: Michael India has a great post on it. Michelin.

01:03:15
<transcript>: I like Michael.

01:03:19
rudixworld: AW guess the build gonna take months with amplify

01:03:29
<transcript>: Create an Amplify app with CDK with the rest of the backend. Yeah, exactly like if I want to create my app Sync API myself, I don't want to have to use an Amplify abstraction on top of all the services I like to use.

01:03:29
<transcript>: can i just

01:03:35
<transcript>: Can I just use Amplify Hosting to handle my next JS deploy instead of her cell. That'd be fantastic.

01:03:35
<transcript>: remember

01:03:43
<transcript>: Remember that time I said they should make JavaScript for the backend. And you said, how would they do that? Javascript is a client side description language. And now here we are. Did I say that? Dave.

01:03:48
<transcript>: No, you don't. Don't. What.

01:03:49
shiftlessatol: yes

01:03:53
blakegreendev: Yes

01:03:53
<transcript>: Aw, guess the build gonna take months with amplify.

01:03:57
shiftlessatol: then 2 years later you told me about node.js

01:03:58
<transcript>: Yes, Yes.

01:04:01
<transcript>: What's happening? I'm gonna keep moving.

01:04:01
<transcript>: so

01:04:07
<transcript>: So why does my context end up note? Let's look at local storage. Let's just look at what's in there.

01:04:07
<transcript>: what do you say

01:04:09
<transcript>: What do you say.

01:04:11
<transcript>: Let's look.

01:04:11
<transcript>: at what's in there

01:04:12
<transcript>: At what's in there.

01:04:14
<transcript>: Storage.

01:04:17
<transcript>: Local storage.

01:04:17
<transcript>: for

01:04:20
<transcript>: For this thing.

01:04:25
<transcript>: Okay. What am I leaking here? If I if I show this.

01:04:29
<transcript>: Oh, it's not in here at all. Okay. So it's not been.

01:04:31
blakegreendev: Yes lol

01:04:32
<transcript>: Yeah, I can't seem to.

01:04:32
<transcript>: i can't seem

01:04:34
<transcript>: I can't seem to initialize this thing.

01:04:34
<transcript>: let's just

01:04:37
<transcript>: Let's just blank that out.

01:04:37
<transcript>: and now context

01:04:39
<transcript>: And now context will just immediately be available.

01:04:49
<transcript>: So I got some animations going.

01:04:49
<transcript>: let's see classic

01:04:52
<transcript>: Let's see. Classicory. What is this one.

01:04:54
<transcript>: Poo.

01:04:54
<transcript>: cloud directory i've

01:04:55
<transcript>: Cloud Directory I've.

01:05:14
<transcript>: So we've got like you get more time. I know this one. Devops screw. No davoscrew compute Optimizer. No, I don't know. I don't know this one. I do know this one. So you get plus 5 seconds every time you get a right one. Oh, that's rapid to do that so easy. You get points for your streak. So here are my scores going up.

01:05:16
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:05:18
<transcript>: Cloud trail.

01:05:21
<transcript>: I haven't missed one yet. Have I.

01:05:21
<transcript>: guys

01:05:25
<transcript>: Guys. I'm kind of good at the game I made. I'm kind of good at it.

01:05:31
<transcript>: Professional services.

01:05:41
<transcript>: A lot of you just kind of guess like you just look at the picture and you're like, what does that look like? Transfer family. Probably. Yeah. Still have a missed. We're on an eight in a row. Streak.

01:05:44
<transcript>: What is this.

01:05:49
<transcript>: Oh, I don't know, OpsWorks. It's not a bit bridge. It's not like, Yeah.

01:05:49
<transcript>: it's just

01:05:52
<transcript>: It's just process of elimination. Sometimes pinpoint.

01:05:52
<transcript>: we are just

01:05:55
<transcript>: We are just we're doing really good.

01:05:55
<transcript>: that's i am

01:05:58
<transcript>: That's I am. That's not what is the Directory service.

01:05:58
<transcript>: look

01:05:59
<transcript>: Look at this.

01:05:59
<transcript>: still haven't

01:06:04
<transcript>: Still haven't missed the perfect game. What is the one.

01:06:14
<transcript>: Oh, Geez, I don't know. It's not that it's not that it's either. Elastic transcoder. It's last transcoder.

01:06:14
<transcript>: oh man it's

01:06:15
<transcript>: Oh, man, it's more.

01:06:15
<transcript>: okay

01:06:20
<transcript>: Okay. I should probably stop playing my game and start building my game. That's IQ.

01:06:27
<transcript>: Yeah. What else I need to do? Do I want to put the street video on the screen.

01:06:35
shiftlessatol: yues

01:06:35
<transcript>: Don't like have your number of like what streak you're on, like in a ball, in a box down here or in a circle, just like these.

01:06:38
<transcript>: I'm not sure.

01:06:38
<transcript>: what is this

01:06:40
<transcript>: What is this? Look out for equipment.

01:06:41
shiftlessatol: you want to do that

01:06:53
<transcript>: The IoT one click. I have no idea. I have two device management. That was tough. There's two IoT ones.

01:06:57
<transcript>: This is ElastiCache.

01:06:57
<transcript>: yeah

01:07:01
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. So we need to have, like at the end of the game.

01:07:01
<transcript>: your score

01:07:09
<transcript>: Your score, and then a leaderboard. That's the next thing we're gonna build. We need to have a leaderboard. I need to be moving faster than this.

01:07:09
<transcript>: i've been

01:07:12
<transcript>: I've been an hour into the stream. I've done nothing.

01:07:12
<transcript>: i've literally done nothing

01:07:13
<transcript>: I've literally done nothing.

01:07:19
<transcript>: Two years later, you told me about NodeJS.

01:07:26
<transcript>: I don't remember that conversation, Dave, but I believe you. I do believe you. Yes, yes. Lol.

01:07:31
<transcript>: Okay.

01:07:42
<transcript>: So let's put the streak in the bottom, right? And then I'm gonna forget about the man. I really want to, like, watch. I save this file. It's gonna just, like, hot reload, and it's gonna take me back.

01:07:42
<transcript>: now

01:07:44
shiftlessatol: you want to add the streak

01:07:44
<transcript>: Now it didn't actually.

01:07:51
<transcript>: Let's just make it see a CSS change? Let's see if I want to oh, Geez, no.

01:07:53
<transcript>: If I want to.

01:07:56
<transcript>: Do something like.

01:08:00
<transcript>: Why is that so far down.

01:08:02
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:08:10
<transcript>: I want to add, let's just add the streak. Let's just go and do that. I should make a component out of this thing.

01:08:14
<transcript>: To make this a component, but I'm not going to again.

01:08:14
<transcript>: not going

01:08:16
<transcript>: Not going to.

01:08:22
<transcript>: So here's this one. We're gonna say this is.

01:08:25
<transcript>: Top? No, it's gonna be bottom, right.

01:08:29
<transcript>: So like this.

01:08:38
<transcript>: See when I when I save the state of the game is not persisted. So we just bounce back to a new game, and that's what I wanted to fit.

01:08:38
<transcript>: it feel good

01:08:40
<transcript>: It feel good to fix that.

01:08:44
<transcript>: Where's the little label for this one.

01:08:44
<transcript>: score

01:08:46
<transcript>: Score so it's.

01:08:46
<transcript>: text mar

01:08:48
<transcript>: Text margin top.

01:08:52
<transcript>: Bottom, right.

01:08:55
<transcript>: Text. I guess it needs to go after.

01:09:03
<transcript>: So much. This is what I was trying to do with the persistent thing, right.

01:09:06
<transcript>: Wait.

01:09:06
<transcript>: no that's

01:09:08
<transcript>: No, that's not how that should be.

01:09:11
<transcript>: Flex.

01:09:18
<transcript>: I guess it should be up here. But why is it not showing up at all.

01:09:22
<transcript>: Oh, there it is. Street. It just was hidden.

01:09:25
<transcript>: It was just hidden.

01:09:25
<transcript>: i got

01:09:29
<transcript>: I gotta persist this thing I gotta persist the state, you know.

01:09:33
<transcript>: Let's do this. Okay. I have an idea. I have an idea.

01:09:40
<transcript>: Let's do this. Let's say so. We'll only set the state.

01:09:40
<transcript>: if

01:09:44
<transcript>: If initial state dot contact has a value or something.

01:09:47
<transcript>: Initial state.

01:09:52
<transcript>: So let's do this. Let's say initial.

01:09:54
<transcript>: Eight.

01:10:04
<transcript>: Undefined.

01:10:09
<transcript>: Like that? Well, that work. Who thinks that'll work.

01:10:14
<transcript>: Hydration failed because the initial UI is not matched with render on the server.

01:10:17
<transcript>: Okay.

01:10:22
<transcript>: Am I actually setting this state in my service now.

01:10:25
<transcript>: What is that persist.

01:10:30
<transcript>: State okay so I am persisting current.

01:10:38
<transcript>: If there is an initial state, use it otherwise.

01:10:47
<transcript>: So now it seems like it actually is persisting our state. Is it in here? Yeah. A Tobs gets look at this. Look at this.

01:10:49
<transcript>: Let's delete it.

01:10:51
<transcript>: Let's delete it and refresh.

01:10:51
<transcript>: okay

01:10:56
<transcript>: Okay. So it's not it's not initial state might have a value.

01:10:56
<transcript>: it's

01:11:00
<transcript>: It's that context should have a value, maybe.

01:11:07
<transcript>: We need to remove this. This is done.

01:11:13
<transcript>: It's not over here.

01:11:18
<transcript>: Okay. So far so I.

01:11:22
<transcript>: Choose I actually do something here.

01:11:22
<transcript>: what is that

01:11:24
<transcript>: What is that? Cell count.

01:11:28
<transcript>: So now our state should be persisted. There it is.

01:11:28
<transcript>: now

01:11:32
<transcript>: Now when I refresh the page, it's unhappy because.

01:11:32
<transcript>: the server

01:11:36
<transcript>: The server. Oh, because the server can't it doesn't have local stores.

01:11:36
<transcript>: oh bummer

01:11:38
<transcript>: Oh, bummer.

01:11:41
<transcript>: You know what I need to do.

01:11:43
<transcript>: What I need to do.

01:11:43
<transcript>: is

01:11:47
<transcript>: Is make each game its own page.

01:11:47
<transcript>: so we navigate

01:11:50
<transcript>: So we navigate you to a game page.

01:11:50
<transcript>: yeah

01:11:51
<transcript>: Yeah, right.

01:11:55
<transcript>: Maybe.

01:11:55
<transcript>: maybe

01:11:56
<transcript>: Maybe.

01:12:05
<transcript>: If it were on its own page, then we can actually serve or render the appropriate state.

01:12:10
<transcript>: Let me think about this.

01:12:16
<transcript>: I was just gonna have it all on a single route.

01:12:19
shiftlessatol: you just did somethign and scored 7 more?

01:12:28
<transcript>: You just did something in scored seven more. I think it's I think the state is.

01:12:33
<transcript>: Oh, it's giving me points. I'm not even what.

01:12:36
shiftlessatol: now 4

01:12:37
<transcript>: Most happening.

01:12:39
shiftlessatol: you win!

01:12:41
<transcript>: Okay, so restoring the state.

01:12:41
<transcript>: not

01:12:43
<transcript>: Not great right now.

01:12:46
<transcript>: Choice game.

01:12:46
<transcript>: score zero

01:12:48
<transcript>: Score zero round.

01:12:49
shiftlessatol: refresh hack!

01:12:52
<transcript>: Okay. This might not work.

01:12:52
<transcript>: i might

01:13:01
<transcript>: I might not. I might not be able to persist the state. It just sucks for this reload situation, like in local development is just completely broken.

01:13:01
<transcript>: that sucks

01:13:02
<transcript>: That sucks.

01:13:04
<transcript>: Refresh.

01:13:10
<transcript>: Do I care? Or can I just muscle through all this.

01:13:18
<transcript>: I don't know if I care or not.

01:13:25
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the follow life.

01:13:27
<transcript>: In.

01:13:27
<transcript>: okay

01:13:31
<transcript>: Okay, let's just abandon all the persisting.

01:13:31
<transcript>: it's not gonna work

01:13:32
<transcript>: It's not gonna work.

01:13:37
shiftlessatol: you'll have to check if there is something that is more better on the client than what is being initialized

01:13:39
<transcript>: Let's just do this.

01:13:41
ohmymndy: How about server side sessions?

01:13:48
<transcript>: Persisted site? Where is that.

01:13:51
<transcript>: Here.

01:13:51
<transcript>: delete this

01:13:53
<transcript>: Delete this whole thing.

01:13:53
<transcript>: and

01:13:55
<transcript>: And then.

01:14:00
<transcript>: It's gonna cause some errors like this.

01:14:02
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:14:07
<transcript>: And then.

01:14:11
<transcript>: This just deleting. That.

01:14:17
<transcript>: Okay. I don't need that hook anymore.

01:14:22
<transcript>: What was that.

01:14:28
<transcript>: This event. We're not using event that's fine.

01:14:31
<transcript>: Okay.

01:14:34
<transcript>: Don't need that anymore.

01:14:38
<transcript>: Cool. So just not even using positive Zoom, but that's fine.

01:14:41
<transcript>: Okay.

01:14:56
<transcript>: So if you refresh the page, your game is lost.

01:15:00
<transcript>: Is are we okay with that from like a conceptual standpoint.

01:15:02
shiftlessatol: and when you run out of time - you get more time again!

01:15:02
<transcript>: Is that.

01:15:04
<transcript>: To.

01:15:04
<transcript>: refresh the page

01:15:05
<transcript>: Refresh the page.

01:15:10
<transcript>: All the state was just in your local page and that's it and it's gone.

01:15:15
<transcript>: It's okay. How about serverside, sessions.

01:15:23
<transcript>: You'll have to check if there is something that is more better on the client than what is being initialized.

01:15:28
<transcript>: And when you run out of time, you get more time again.

01:15:34
<transcript>: Yeah, yeah. I've got the timer kind of turned off right now because I want to be able to build without the pressure of the timer.

01:15:39
<transcript>: So this is going to be.

01:15:39
<transcript>: street

01:15:40
<transcript>: Street.

01:15:43
<transcript>: I.

01:15:46
<transcript>: Street, Delta, I guess.

01:15:51
<transcript>: I'm not gonna have an animation on this one.

01:15:55
<transcript>: I.

01:16:04
<transcript>: 'm okay with the game that's Step functions.

01:16:09
<transcript>: From a one streak, I guess do not show streak if it's okay, I need to style this better.

01:16:12
<transcript>: Flex.

01:16:17
<transcript>: Will say justify end.

01:16:22
<transcript>: No.

01:16:22
<transcript>: items

01:16:24
<transcript>: Items bottom or something.

01:16:29
<transcript>: Items, end.

01:16:33
<transcript>: There we go.

01:16:37
<transcript>: Streak Score timer.

01:16:37
<transcript>: so

01:16:40
<transcript>: So we don't maybe show streak if there's no streak.

01:16:40
<transcript>: we'll just say

01:16:41
<transcript>: We'll just say.

01:16:49
<transcript>: Streak and.

01:16:49
<transcript>: it's not strea

01:16:52
<transcript>: It's not streak. It's context.

01:16:52
<transcript>: game

01:16:54
<transcript>: Game streak.

01:17:01
<transcript>: So when you start you don't have a streak. Cost Explorer Now I've got a street going.

01:17:01
<transcript>: there's one

01:17:05
<transcript>: There's one. Really a streak. I don't know. Maybe not.

01:17:07
<transcript>: I'm on a streak of two.

01:17:13
<transcript>: What do we think? Does that add anything to this experience.

01:17:13
<transcript>: keeping

01:17:16
<transcript>: Keeping track of like a streak that you're on.

01:17:23
sockthedev: i dig it

01:17:24
<transcript>: Server side sessions? What do you think about serverside? Sessions? Mandy.

01:17:24
<transcript>: you're saying

01:17:32
<transcript>: You're saying I should I should keep track. I mean, the state is all on the server and it's in the database, I guess.

01:17:34
<transcript>: The question is.

01:17:40
ohmymndy: As a backend developer, I approve :-)

01:17:40
<transcript>: How do we want to do that? Do we want to I mean, we're gonna have off.

01:17:44
<transcript>: First if you want to save your like to the leaderboard.

01:17:44
<transcript>: at the back

01:17:47
<transcript>: At the back end developers Mandia approves.

01:17:50
<transcript>: Let's see we could.

01:17:50
<transcript>: yeah we

01:17:54
<transcript>: Yeah, we could do, like a page. So slash play or something.

01:17:54
<transcript>: we could say

01:17:56
<transcript>: We could say, like.

01:17:56
<transcript>: play

01:17:57
<transcript>: Play.

01:17:57
<transcript>: is

01:17:58
<transcript>: Is.

01:18:04
<transcript>: Or it could be like.

01:18:10
<transcript>: Game, and then like the game. Id.

01:18:13
<transcript>: And then that page can always render.

01:18:18
<transcript>: It can restore the state for the state machine.

01:18:18
<transcript>: maybe we should do that

01:18:19
<transcript>: Maybe we should do that.

01:18:21
<transcript>: Yeah. Maybe we should.

01:18:26
<transcript>: Will that fix my hot reload? Yeah, it will.

01:18:28
<transcript>: It will.

01:18:28
<transcript>: okay

01:18:30
<transcript>: Okay, let's do it.

01:18:37
<transcript>: Let's do it so your game if you did refresh your page like you're still in the middle of the game. The games are so short that like.

01:18:37
<transcript>: i don't know if you refresh

01:18:42
<transcript>: I don't know if you refresh your page, it's probably gonna like bomb your score if anyone cares I don't know.

01:18:46
<transcript>: Is anyone gonna play this but me.

01:18:51
<transcript>: There gonna be a leaderboard so someone will play.

01:18:51
<transcript>: thanks so

01:18:59
<transcript>: Thanks so much for follow Bodri someone will play if there's a leaderboard gotta get that leaderboard top score right.

01:19:01
<transcript>: Okay.

01:19:01
<transcript>: so we're showing

01:19:07
<transcript>: So we're showing the streak. Now, I think that's an improvement. It does visually look a little weird.

01:19:07
<transcript>: down there

01:19:11
<transcript>: Down there. The Streak. I don't know. Something about it seems kind of weird.

01:19:11
<transcript>: but

01:19:12
<transcript>: But.

01:19:15
<transcript>: It's probably better to show it than not show it.

01:19:20
<transcript>: Maybe we should only show if the streak is greater than one.

01:19:25
<transcript>: Because a streak of one doesn't make much sense, does it.

01:19:28
<transcript>: I guess I have to do like.

01:19:31
<transcript>: No streak at Zero. Nope.

01:19:34
<transcript>: Nope.

01:19:37
badrekb: GlitchLit

01:19:43
<transcript>: Did I miss something.

01:19:54
<transcript>: I think if you're on a streak of one, you're not really on a street now, are you? Deep bracer.

01:19:58
<transcript>: But once we get our second one.

01:19:58
<transcript>: now

01:20:00
<transcript>: Now we're on a Street.

01:20:03
<transcript>: The street is active event bridge.

01:20:03
<transcript>: i'm getting

01:20:08
<transcript>: I'm getting pretty good at this. I think I've just seen these all so much now.

01:20:08
<transcript>: that i actually

01:20:10
<transcript>: That I actually know what these things are.

01:20:18
<transcript>: I might get the high score people? I might welcome to Chat bodre? Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.

01:20:21
<transcript>: Also thanks for the follow Wilner.

01:20:23
<transcript>: Elner.

01:20:26
<transcript>: Did I mess up your name? Terribly.

01:20:26
<transcript>: what

01:20:31
<transcript>: What is this now? I just said that that's badge. I always get hung up on batch.

01:20:39
<transcript>: I don't know what this is. Grafana. Look at that. It looked like a graph.

01:20:41
<transcript>: Resilience hub.

01:20:48
<transcript>: So. Okay. Do we think this added something having the streak there. That's good. We like that.

01:20:50
<transcript>: Kafka.

01:20:59
<transcript>: Neuron. Okay, I'm done, but I just got a Tinder and I feel like I should keep going.

01:21:05
<transcript>: I also might want to change the layout. Oh, I started do.

01:21:11
<transcript>: When you're on like desktop, maybe we'll do the answers beside the visual. I think that's what I'll do.

01:21:16
<transcript>: Think that makes more sense, but I need to fix the layout. It's terrible.

01:21:23
<transcript>: Also on mobile. Is this gonna work.

01:21:25
<transcript>: Like, is this.

01:21:31
<transcript>: Can you actually see all the options? Yeah. So iphone twelve. You can see all the options.

01:21:32
wuelnerdotexe: Neovim is life CoolCat

01:21:36
<transcript>: I guess like iphone. Smaller iphones. Maybe not early. See you in there.

01:21:38
<transcript>: Se.

01:21:38
<transcript>: oh if

01:21:42
<transcript>: Oh, if you're on an old iphone, feel the bad experience.

01:21:44
<transcript>: Well, we'll come back to that.

01:21:48
<transcript>: New Ofim is life Wellner.

01:21:48
<transcript>: i

01:21:57
wuelnerdotexe: Hola, greetings from Guatemala, guys 🇬🇹

01:21:59
<transcript>: I agree. I love many of them so much. It's just made programming fun again. After 15 years, things start to kind of stacknate. You get a little bored with building your, like, 400.

01:21:59
<transcript>: react app

01:22:00
<transcript>: React app.

01:22:04
<transcript>: Neoven has provided this like.

01:22:04
<transcript>: new

01:22:09
<transcript>: New things to play with and make things exciting again. I don't know. I love it.

01:22:13
<transcript>: And the people I love, all the people in the Neovem community.

01:22:13
<transcript>: teach is one of

01:22:19
<transcript>: Teach is one of the best that there is Greetings from Guatemala. Welcome from Guatemala.

01:22:19
<transcript>: or welcome from

01:22:21
<transcript>: Or welcome from America.

01:22:21
<transcript>: welcome

01:22:24
<transcript>: Welcome, welcome, welcome.

01:22:29
ohmymndy: I am quite excited for the Neovim conf

01:22:36
<transcript>: Okay, let's do the server side thing. So let's make this like a game. And then the game. Do I want to use the new app directory? Is it baked enough? That is the question.

01:22:42
<transcript>: That is the question, is it baked? I don't know that it is.

01:22:42
<transcript>: quite

01:22:44
<transcript>: Quite excited for Neovem. Comp.

01:22:47
<transcript>: Are you going Mandy? Or just just virtual.

01:22:58
<transcript>: Okay. We want to now.

01:23:07
<transcript>: Let's do the service, I think. And the question is, do I move all this into an app directory? I don't know.

01:23:07
<transcript>: i'm using

01:23:10
ohmymndy: I thought it is only virtual, but even if it is in the flesh, it is probably too far from here

01:23:12
<transcript>: I'm using the T Three stack. I created a T Three app with Create T Three app.

01:23:12
<transcript>: shout

01:23:18
<transcript>: Shoutout Nextle I thought it was only virtual. Oh, maybe it is. Even if it is in the flesh, it's probably too far from here. Yeah.

01:23:18
<transcript>: yeah

01:23:21
<transcript>: Yeah, it might only be virtual? You might be right.

01:23:26
<transcript>: Okay, Let's.

01:23:26
<transcript>: see

01:23:30
<transcript>: See? So if I moved into the app directory, would Stuff still work.

01:23:30
<transcript>: i might

01:23:35
<transcript>: I might just stick with the Pages directory. I think it's probably safer.

01:23:35
<transcript>: right now

01:23:36
<transcript>: Right now.

01:23:38
ohmymndy: What are those bulbs in your file tree?

01:23:40
<transcript>: Given that things are still a bit up in the air.

01:23:43
<transcript>: Still very experimental. All the React 18 stuff.

01:23:45
shiftlessatol: this one

01:23:49
shiftlessatol: const game = await newGameMutation.mutateAsync({ name: "test" })

01:23:52
<transcript>: One of those bulbs in your file tree. They're like when I've changed files. I think.

01:23:57
<transcript>: And then if I like, do something Domino file, and I say, like.

01:24:00
<transcript>: It doesn't build. It gives me that little X. See that.

01:24:03
<transcript>: I didn't know what plugin does. That.

01:24:06
<transcript>: Weird right now.

01:24:14
<transcript>: Okay. So let's say we did want to create a new page. We're gonna put let's see a game director.

01:24:19
<transcript>: And then we're gonna have.

01:24:19
<transcript>: a new page

01:24:20
wuelnerdotexe: @ohmymndy LSP Diagnostics maybe...

01:24:21
<transcript>: A new page in here called.

01:24:25
<transcript>: Modifiables off on Added new? Yeah, here we go.

01:24:25
<transcript>: called

01:24:27
<transcript>: Called.

01:24:27
<transcript>: id

01:24:28
<transcript>: Id.

01:24:34
<transcript>: Okay. So there's our game ID.

01:24:37
<transcript>: So we're gonna navigate to this page.

01:24:47
<transcript>: Instead of having all this in one just one page. We're gonna say when you click Play game, you go to a new game page. And if you refresh that page.

01:24:47
<transcript>: you will be

01:24:50
<transcript>: You will be in the middle. Oh, no, wait.

01:24:50
<transcript>: that doesn't

01:24:53
<transcript>: That doesn't really work now, does it.

01:24:53
<transcript>: well

01:24:55
<transcript>: Well, okay.

01:24:55
<transcript>: you guys

01:24:58
<transcript>: You guys can tell me what you think. It's this map.

01:25:01
<transcript>: The.

01:25:07
shiftlessatol: you need to add a thing in this services.start to check for the existing first

01:25:07
<transcript>: Lc diagnostics. Is that what it is.

01:25:07
<transcript>: so

01:25:16
<transcript>: So if I do it this way and there's no off yet, like I wasn't gonna make you sign up. You don't have to sign up unless you want to save your score to a leaderboard.

01:25:25
<transcript>: Because I have to know, like, what the call you could do? The old school. Like initials way, just like tightening three initials.

01:25:31
<transcript>: And that's how you do the leaderboard. I think it'd be more fun, though, if like people could log in with Twitter or something.

01:25:31
<transcript>: discord whatever

01:25:34
<transcript>: Discord whatever and like store their score that way.

01:25:40
<transcript>: But if you haven't opt yet and you have this game page, anyone could hit that link.

01:25:40
<transcript>: and start

01:25:43
<transcript>: And start like answering for you.

01:25:47
<transcript>: So there's no if I'm not actually doing off yet.

01:25:50
<transcript>: You know, I'm saying.

01:25:56
<transcript>: You need to add a thing in this services. Start to check for the existing first.

01:25:59
<transcript>: What's.

01:26:02
<transcript>: On my Dave.

01:26:08
<transcript>: I don't have questions right now about how to implement this, Dave. I'm just asking. I'm asking.

01:26:08
<transcript>: how

01:26:08
shiftlessatol: line 206

01:26:09
<transcript>: How.

01:26:12
<transcript>: How do I want to think about.

01:26:12
<transcript>: server size

01:26:13
<transcript>: Server size.

01:26:16
<transcript>: Line 206, what are you talking about? Dave.

01:26:19
<transcript>: What are we talking about? Here.

01:26:24
shiftlessatol: you don't need to think server side

01:26:27
<transcript>: I'm not. I'm not struggling with some implementation detail right now. I'm just trying to figure out from, like a high level.

01:26:29
shiftlessatol: you're always creating a new game

01:26:31
<transcript>: Don't need to think server side.

01:26:31
<transcript>: what do you what are you trying

01:26:33
<transcript>: What do you what are you trying to say? You're always creating a new game.

01:26:33
shiftlessatol: so your state is always new

01:26:36
<transcript>: Line 206.

01:26:36
shiftlessatol: then you want to repalce it

01:26:41
<transcript>: You're saying I always create a new game.

01:26:41
<transcript>: when the

01:26:42
<transcript>: When the thing starts.

01:26:49
<transcript>: My window managers turn off.

01:26:49
<transcript>: you're

01:26:57
<transcript>: You're saying if I don't create a new game here, when the service starts, well, the machine. When the machine starts, we should create a new game.

01:27:07
<transcript>: Maybe we shouldn't start the machine every time the page relays. Well, that's what I was trying to do. I was trying to pursue preserve the state and local storage.

01:27:07
shiftlessatol: check for the existing context

01:27:13
shiftlessatol: and insert it if it exist

01:27:14
<transcript>: Check for the existing context so your state is always new.

01:27:18
<transcript>: You're just saying to fix my hot module reload.

01:27:22
<transcript>: Or are you just saying, just just store the game ID.

01:27:22
<transcript>: just

01:27:23
shiftlessatol: yes

01:27:26
<transcript>: Just store the game ID in.

01:27:26
<transcript>: local

01:27:28
<transcript>: Local storage or something.

01:27:28
<transcript>: your

01:27:31
<transcript>: Your current game and then just refresh.

01:27:31
<transcript>: yeah

01:27:34
<transcript>: Yeah, we could do that right.

01:27:37
shiftlessatol: all of this

01:27:43
<transcript>: Then in here instead of creating you're saying, just don't create a new game. Instead, check local storage if local storage has.

01:27:52
<transcript>: Yeah, I can do that safely. Right. Because this will never run on the server so I can check local storage here. Get a game ID if there is a current game I. D.

01:28:04
<transcript>: And then what's the what's the what do I have to fix for, like, new game? Well, I guess if the game is over, then it'll just take you to the game over page.

01:28:04
<transcript>: right

01:28:06
<transcript>: Right. We'll test it. Let's just try it.

01:28:14
<transcript>: So here when we create a new game, we'll just do it immediately. We'll say local storage.

01:28:16
<transcript>: Set item.

01:28:20
<transcript>: Current Game ID.

01:28:25
<transcript>: I'm doing the Kabob case. Feels right.

01:28:25
<transcript>: game

01:28:29
<transcript>: Game ID. Okay, so we store it right here.

01:28:33
<transcript>: I'm not gonna store the current round.

01:28:35
<transcript>: We're just gonna store the current game.

01:28:40
<transcript>: Well, how would I do that then? So if I store the game ID.

01:28:40
<transcript>: here

01:28:43
<transcript>: Here. Then when I come in to start.

01:28:47
<transcript>: I gotta think about this.

01:28:50
shiftlessatol: check for it

01:28:50
<transcript>: How does this.

01:28:57
<transcript>: How does this work? So it starts out on idle.

01:29:00
<transcript>: And then on start game. It goes to starting.

01:29:06
<transcript>: Starting runs the Start service. It's going to start out on idle.

01:29:06
<transcript>: and

01:29:12
<transcript>: And that's like when you refresh the page, it's gonna come here. And if you don't click on that button.

01:29:12
lilfreezi: u look so HANDSOME and FIT and BUILT today

01:29:21
<transcript>: It's not going to Lil freeze. Wow. Looks so handsome and fit and built today. What did I do? Did I flex.

01:29:26
<transcript>: You're saying as opposed to other days.

01:29:27
lilfreezi: LUL

01:29:31
<transcript>: Other days I look not those things. But today, in particular.

01:29:31
<transcript>: i'll take it

01:29:32
<transcript>: I'll take it.

01:29:32
<transcript>: so

01:29:35
<transcript>: So the problem Dave is.

01:29:37
<transcript>: When we refresh the page.

01:29:39
<transcript>: Let's just take this out.

01:29:39
<transcript>: every time

01:29:48
<transcript>: Every time we refresh the page the game is gonna the game machine. The state machine is going to start in the idle state and you have to click new game.

01:29:50
cowfacedude99: well I think it is time to make you a harpoon man.

01:29:51
<transcript>: To start again.

01:29:54
<transcript>: Right.

01:29:58
<transcript>: Unless.

01:29:58
shiftlessatol: you can store the context

01:30:03
cowfacedude99: I totally forgot that harpoon has tmux support new

01:30:05
shiftlessatol: and then inject it in this

01:30:06
cowfacedude99: now*

01:30:08
<transcript>: Could we change that behavior.

01:30:19
shiftlessatol: so move it from start to idle

01:30:24
<transcript>: Let's see. Well, I think it's time to make you a Harpoon, man. You can store the context. I totally forgot the Harpoon has tmux support now. Ooh, I do love prime. So in that sense, I'm sure I love Harpoon injected in this.

01:30:24
<transcript>: you can store the

01:30:28
<transcript>: You can store the context then injected in this so move it from start to idle.

01:30:31
<transcript>: So move it from start.

01:30:33
<transcript>: To idle.

01:30:39
<transcript>: I do think there's a way to do this client side and not have to start.

01:30:39
shiftlessatol: the existing check

01:30:44
<transcript>: I got things about this.

01:30:51
shiftlessatol: and then auto start with the previous context if it exist

01:30:55
<transcript>: We could just say like the index page doesn't have the state machine. It just hasn't a button that takes you into.

01:31:04
<transcript>: I don't know. I like the simplicity of like one big state machine having the whole game.

01:31:04
<transcript>: state

01:31:08
<transcript>: State the whole app in this state machine is kind of nice.

01:31:13
<transcript>: And then auto. Start with the previous context if it exists.

01:31:17
<transcript>: So if current game.

01:31:22
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:31:22
<transcript>: if

01:31:24
<transcript>: If in here.

01:31:28
<transcript>: When we use machine we can.

01:31:31
<transcript>: We can say I'm going to turn off the Dev tool.

01:31:31
<transcript>: services

01:31:34
<transcript>: Services. Let's just.

01:31:37
cowfacedude99: let me look at the docs, and I will send something on your way

01:31:39
<transcript>: Close that all down. So now I want just want to close services down.

01:31:41
<transcript>: Here.

01:31:41
<transcript>: so

01:31:44
<transcript>: So we can pass in.

01:31:44
<transcript>: also

01:31:45
<transcript>: Also.

01:31:45
<transcript>: a state

01:31:53
<transcript>: A state which is like an initial state state. To rehydrate the machine to the machine will start at this site instead of its initial state.

01:31:53
<transcript>: we

01:31:55
<transcript>: We can do that.

01:32:00
<transcript>: Or can we say.

01:32:03
<transcript>: Oh, wait. This state.

01:32:07
<transcript>: Configuration.

01:32:09
<transcript>: Context game of event.

01:32:21
<transcript>: State.

01:32:28
<transcript>: Is that via. Is that the initial state? Is that what I was looking at up here.

01:32:33
<transcript>: Initial.

01:32:39
<transcript>: Initial state node key since starting an idol we could.

01:32:41
<transcript>: Jump straight into.

01:32:46
<transcript>: But it's not going to run start if we don't go into starting.

01:32:50
<transcript>: I don't think this is the right way to do it.

01:32:55
<transcript>: Expired after expires.

01:32:59
<transcript>: Of guessing.

01:33:03
<transcript>: Picking Answers showing answer.

01:33:10
<transcript>: And then our Start service. We were saying, we could say.

01:33:17
shiftlessatol: you create a new context when the page loads - you could even just do it there conditionally

01:33:17
<transcript>: No, I don't think we would go into starting.

01:33:21
<transcript>: I don't think we would ever go into starting. We would jump straight into.

01:33:24
<transcript>: Active.

01:33:27
<transcript>: But how would we do that.

01:33:27
<transcript>: in order to

01:33:31
<transcript>: In order to jump into act if we'd need to have a context that has.

01:33:36
<transcript>: Active starts with guessing.

01:33:49
<transcript>: I don't know how I don't know how to just arbitrarily say we could if you refresh the page at any time, we can just reinitialize the state machine without reinchilizing it with the whole state, the whole thing.

01:33:49
<transcript>: and

01:33:54
<transcript>: And we tried that and it didn't work. We couldn't get it to work, right.

01:33:59
<transcript>: Create a new context. When the page loads, you could even just do it. Their conditionally.

01:33:59
<transcript>: i think that

01:34:05
<transcript>: I think that's exactly what we just did, right, Dave? We just tried persisting the whole state.

01:34:10
<transcript>: I was trying to persist the entire state.

01:34:13
<transcript>: And rehydrate with it.

01:34:13
<transcript>: and

01:34:17
<transcript>: And I was failing miserably. Was I just making some terrible.

01:34:18
shiftlessatol: not the entire state

01:34:21
<transcript>: Error. And there's it is possible to do it.

01:34:25
<transcript>: Wait. I wasn't trying to just store the context. No, I wasn't.

01:34:25
shiftlessatol: just the context

01:34:30
<transcript>: I was trying to store the entire state. It was right down here.

01:34:34
<transcript>: So what do I have available to me in this context.

01:34:37
<transcript>: I was trying to store up here.

01:34:41
<transcript>: Current.

01:34:43
<transcript>: Right.

01:34:46
<transcript>: Which is the state.

01:34:46
<transcript>: did

01:34:50
<transcript>: Did the Doc say to do it differently? Persist, say set item.

01:34:50
<transcript>: current state

01:34:51
<transcript>: Current state.

01:35:00
<transcript>: And then to restore it you do state create statedefinition.

01:35:05
<transcript>: I.

01:35:09
<transcript>: Pass the previous state.

01:35:09
<transcript>: that's

01:35:11
<transcript>: That's what we tried to do.

01:35:14
<transcript>: Not the entire state, just the context.

01:35:22
<transcript>: Or.

01:35:25
<transcript>: I could just not worry about this.

01:35:36
<transcript>: I could just not worry about it because it's just affecting me in development, and I'm almost done with this app, and I need to start making progress on a leaderboard. I think I'm just gonna ignore it.

01:35:36
<transcript>: because i think

01:35:37
<transcript>: Because I think.

01:35:41
<transcript>: If you refresh the page like on aws.com.

01:35:41
<transcript>: you just

01:35:46
shiftlessatol: version 2!

01:35:46
<transcript>: You just lost that game. Like you just that game ended. They're only 45 seconds long. Like.

01:35:46
<transcript>: play

01:35:48
<transcript>: Play again.

01:35:59
<transcript>: I think we could not overcomplicate this and not introduce a bunch of trying to persist game state like we are storing the game in the database.

01:35:59
<transcript>: and every time

01:36:04
<transcript>: And every time you answer, like we're updating that database, record.

01:36:06
<transcript>: But.

01:36:06
<transcript>: all the

01:36:12
shiftlessatol: oops this is version 2 - version 2.1~

01:36:14
<transcript>: All the the current the ability to play the game lives in your one browser session. I think refreshing that page.

01:36:14
<transcript>: i think it's

01:36:17
<transcript>: I think it's fine if that game just goes away.

01:36:21
<transcript>: Version two. Yeah, we'll do that in version Two. There you go.

01:36:24
<transcript>: Version two. Okay.

01:36:24
<transcript>: so

01:36:25
<transcript>: So.

01:36:25
<transcript>: let's get back

01:36:29
<transcript>: Let's get back to did I make any changes here that I regret.

01:36:33
<transcript>: What was I doing? I was down here. I was doing something. I don't want to store that anymore.

01:36:39
<transcript>: Okay, so when the game starts, we create a new game. We could move around.

01:36:39
<transcript>: we

01:36:42
<transcript>: We restart the timer.

01:36:45
<transcript>: Okay.

01:36:49
<transcript>: Let's make a leaderboard because we got to do auth for that.

01:36:55
<transcript>: I don't know what? Those monsters.

01:37:00
<transcript>: No, that's not that.

01:37:06
<transcript>: So see the timer goes faster if you start missing them, you lose 5 seconds every time.

01:37:06
<transcript>: we might have to play

01:37:07
shiftlessatol: you should also do highest streak

01:37:08
<transcript>: We might have to play with that timing wise.

01:37:11
<transcript>: Okay little.

01:37:11
<transcript>: let's think about

01:37:18
<transcript>: Let's think about the leaderboard here. Let's let's do off. I think when the game ends, let's just build out the game end page.

01:37:24
<transcript>: Make a new.

01:37:27
<transcript>: Here.

01:37:28
shiftlessatol: on leaderboards

01:37:30
<transcript>: New one of these.

01:37:42
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:37:46
<transcript>: Commit.

01:37:54
<transcript>: Visuals.

01:37:59
<transcript>: Okay.

01:38:04
<transcript>: Let's.

01:38:12
<transcript>: Go to.

01:38:14
<transcript>: I need to leave those.

01:38:22
<transcript>: App Index we still just have the one page. We're gonna have a leaderboard page.

01:38:22
<transcript>: off

01:38:26
<transcript>: Off. How does off configured right now prison adapter for Next sauce.

01:38:26
<transcript>: discord

01:38:30
<transcript>: Discord provider. Okay, so we were using this chord.

01:38:34
<transcript>: That actually set up this cord ID and stuff.

01:38:34
<transcript>: let's just

01:38:38
<transcript>: Let's just check. So I think it's like, off.

01:38:41
<transcript>: Login sign in.

01:38:45
<transcript>: Like that? No. What is it? You know.

01:38:47
<transcript>: Sign up.

01:38:47
<transcript>: log

01:38:51
<transcript>: Login I can't remember the name of the route.

01:38:51
<transcript>: that this thing creates

01:38:53
<transcript>: That this thing creates for you.

01:38:53
<transcript>: we've

01:38:56
<transcript>: We've got the prison adapter.

01:38:56
<transcript>: x

01:38:58
<transcript>: X. Off. Let's just do this.

01:39:09
<transcript>: It has like a builtin sign in page, right? That's still a thing.

01:39:12
<transcript>: I think.

01:39:15
<transcript>: It is.

01:39:30
<transcript>: Here we go. Sign in. It's just gonna use the builtin right API. Oh, API. Auth signin, right.

01:39:33
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:39:33
<transcript>: api

01:39:35
<transcript>: Api.

01:39:35
<transcript>: yeah

01:39:36
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:39:40
<transcript>: Api auth.

01:39:41
<transcript>: author

01:39:42
<transcript>: Author.

01:39:45
<transcript>: It is sign in with Discord. I don't even know.

01:39:50
<transcript>: I don't know if I've got the secrets configured. I probably don't.

01:39:52
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:40:01
<transcript>: A database. Url Next off Discord is empty. Okay.

01:40:01
<transcript>: so let's

01:40:04
<transcript>: So let's do this. Replicas. What.

01:40:08
<transcript>: I'm not using rifle cash. I must have started using replicas. I don't know.

01:40:13
<transcript>: Let's do Twitter client ID.

01:40:13
<transcript>: and twitter

01:40:14
<transcript>: And Twitter.

01:40:14
<transcript>: cl

01:40:16
<transcript>: Client secret.

01:40:25
<transcript>: Okay.

01:40:25
<transcript>: let's

01:40:28
<transcript>: Let's get those secrets.

01:40:32
<transcript>: Twitter.

01:40:36
<transcript>: Developer.

01:40:38
<transcript>: Dev.

01:40:42
<transcript>: Here we go.

01:40:45
devinda_me: i thought you arent using t3 for this app ?

01:40:47
<transcript>: Sign up.

01:40:51
<transcript>: Developer portal.

01:40:53
<transcript>: Here we go.

01:40:53
<transcript>: twenty

01:40:54
<transcript>: 20.

01:40:54
<transcript>: that

01:40:55
<transcript>: That's an old project.

01:40:59
<transcript>: How do I create a new one.

01:41:02
<transcript>: Projects and apps.

01:41:02
<transcript>: pw

01:41:04
<transcript>: Pws FM.

01:41:05
<transcript>: What.

01:41:09
<transcript>: Is that.

01:41:19
<transcript>: Okay, add app no development app 20 so well, project. How do I What do I do here.

01:41:22
<transcript>: Projects and apps.

01:41:25
<transcript>: 20 so is a what.

01:41:25
<transcript>: is that

01:41:29
<transcript>: Is that a project? Yeah, that's a project. I want to create a new project.

01:41:36
<transcript>: Only apps and projects can access V. Two early access endpoints.

01:41:38
<transcript>: Standalone apps.

01:41:42
<transcript>: How do I create a new.

01:41:42
<transcript>: project

01:41:43
<transcript>: Project.

01:41:47
<transcript>: Is it possible.

01:41:53
<transcript>: Go to API playground.

01:41:56
<transcript>: Account.

01:42:05
<transcript>: Maybe I just need to create a Sandwan app. Do I need access to the whatever the V two.

01:42:13
samjandwich: elon disabled the microservice to create new projects

01:42:15
<transcript>: I could just add an app under this project, but this is I don't know what this project is. Reinvent per project two.

01:42:19
<transcript>: I could just rename the project.

01:42:23
<transcript>: Yeah, this is Rename. It.

01:42:25
<transcript>: No more Inc.

01:42:28
<transcript>: income

01:42:28
<transcript>: income consumer

01:42:30
<transcript>: Income consumer tools.

01:42:33
<transcript>: How about that.

01:42:35
daglee: Twitter developer portal? I thought all developers left. Kappa

01:42:41
<transcript>: Cool. Now I can add an new project and feel better about it. Right.

01:42:43
<transcript>: Thought all developers left.

01:42:51
<transcript>: That's funny. Yeah. We'll see if Twitter keeps working long enough for this to support Twitter auth. Let's do new app.

01:42:53
<transcript>: And an existing app.

01:42:53
<transcript>: create a new

01:42:55
<transcript>: Create a new.

01:42:57
<transcript>: Create new.

01:42:59
<transcript>: Staging.

01:42:59
<transcript>: production

01:43:00
<transcript>: Production.

01:43:06
<transcript>: What apps are, where you can get your access keys and tokens.

01:43:06
<transcript>: this

01:43:09
<transcript>: This is AW. Guess.

01:43:15
<transcript>: Oh, Geez.

01:43:15
<transcript>: just

01:43:19
<transcript>: Just leaked. Look at that. They just do it just like that.

01:43:19
<transcript>: okay

01:43:20
<transcript>: Okay.

01:43:20
<transcript>: go ahead

01:43:24
<transcript>: Go ahead and go, Fuzzy, and we're gonna delete those one.

01:43:27
<transcript>: We're gonna delete this one and get a new one.

01:43:29
<transcript>: App settings.

01:43:29
<transcript>: delet

01:43:32
<transcript>: Delete delete.

01:43:32
<transcript>: oh regenerate

01:43:34
<transcript>: Oh, Regenerate, I can regenerate them.

01:43:37
<transcript>: Cool.

01:43:39
<transcript>: Regenerate.

01:43:39
<transcript>: alright

01:43:40
<transcript>: Alright.

01:43:45
<transcript>: Elon disabled the microservice to create new projects. Oh Geez, probably.

01:43:51
<transcript>: I thought you all aren't using T three for this app. The Venda. I went back to T Three because I really didn't have time to rewrite the whole thing.

01:43:52
samjandwich: your head was covering the secret LUL

01:43:57
<transcript>: Highest streak on Leaderboards. That's a good idea. Well, that's a great idea, Dave. Love it.

01:44:07
<transcript>: My head was covering the secret. Oh, was it really? Oh, well, either way, I'm gonna regenerate it. Okay. We're gonna copy this. We're gonna paste it in here.

01:44:07
<transcript>: thank you

01:44:12
<transcript>: Thank you so much to Layton for invoke it's saves me every day.

01:44:15
<transcript>: Wait.

01:44:15
<transcript>: that's not the

01:44:20
<transcript>: That's not the thing I want. Api key is not the same thing as client ID.

01:44:20
<transcript>: is it

01:44:22
<transcript>: Is it.

01:44:26
<transcript>: Or is it I'm maybe this.

01:44:31
<transcript>: Bearer token access token in secret.

01:44:35
<transcript>: Authentication tokens.

01:44:35
<transcript>: bearer

01:44:37
<transcript>: Bearer, token.

01:44:47
<transcript>: Authenticates requests on behalf. The how half of your developer app. I don't need that. I just want.

01:44:51
<transcript>: Is this my client ID? I guess.

01:44:54
<transcript>: I guess.

01:44:56
<transcript>: Why.

01:45:11
<transcript>: I don't know we're gonna try.

01:45:19
<transcript>: Basically authentication.

01:45:24
<transcript>: No, I don't want to use the API. Actually, I just want to use Twitter.

01:45:27
<transcript>: To off.

01:45:27
<transcript>: for my user

01:45:29
<transcript>: For my users to auth right.

01:45:36
<transcript>: Oh, user author authentication. I set up authentication laws use to log into your app with Twitter. Yeah, yeah, that's what I want.

01:45:36
<transcript>: that's

01:45:39
<transcript>: That's what I want. I'm staying on Fuzzy until I figure this out. Sorry.

01:45:42
<transcript>: App permissions.

01:45:42
<transcript>: what

01:45:43
<transcript>: What.

01:45:45
<transcript>: It's a Web app.

01:45:49
<transcript>: Request email from users.

01:45:56
<transcript>: For zero, she asked prosper Policy and Term Service read tweets and profile information that's all I need to do.

01:46:00
<transcript>: Type of email.

01:46:00
<transcript>: the

01:46:02
<transcript>: The Web app.

01:46:06
<transcript>: Callback URL oh, I got to do this.

01:46:09
<transcript>: Call back you are.

01:46:09
<transcript>: this is

01:46:17
<transcript>: This is gonna be maybe there's, like, Mixoff. Docs, I'm gonna come off fuzzy for a SEC. Cuz. This is probably really annoying to watch.

01:46:20
<transcript>: What? Okay.

01:46:22
<transcript>: The.

01:46:22
<transcript>: next

01:46:24
<transcript>: Next off page.

01:46:24
<transcript>: maybe

01:46:26
<transcript>: Maybe has.

01:46:26
<transcript>: some

01:46:29
<transcript>: Some information that would be helpful to me.

01:46:31
<transcript>: Let's see, Twitter.

01:46:34
<transcript>: Provider Providers Twitter.

01:46:37
<transcript>: It's gonna explain. Probably.

01:46:37
<transcript>: twitter

01:46:53
<transcript>: Twitter is currently the only builtin provider using the OAuth 10 spec. Whoa, bummer feels bad. This means that you won't receive an access to Soken or refresh show them, but oh, I've token an OAuth token seat, respectively. Remember to add these to your Davey Schema in case if you're using an adapter.

01:46:53
<transcript>: what a bummer

01:46:54
<transcript>: What a bummer.

01:46:54
<transcript>: twitter

01:46:57
<transcript>: Twitter provider comes with a set of default options.

01:47:05
<transcript>: Client secret. Okay, so read and write. Oh, I have to do this. You must enable the Request email address from Users option in your app permissions. If you want to obtain the user email addresses.

01:47:05
<transcript>: read

01:47:10
<transcript>: Read and write. I have to do read and write direct messages. Why.

01:47:15
<transcript>: Would I have to do that.

01:47:29
<transcript>: Twitter support, though, which is currently optin to enable it. Simply add version two to your provider figures. Oh, okay. Keep in mind that although this changes easy, it changes how and with which of Twitter APIs you can interact. I don't need any of the Twitter API, so that's fine.

02:21:27
<transcript>: Invalid environment variables.

02:21:31
<transcript>: Oh, because next off URL is required. Oh, it's interesting.

02:21:34
<transcript>: Okay.

02:21:34
<transcript>: let's

02:21:36
<transcript>: Let's.

02:21:36
<transcript>: let's see

02:21:37
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:21:43
<transcript>: I guess can I go into my environment and we'll make it optional.

02:21:49
<transcript>: That.

02:21:52
<transcript>: Does that work.

02:21:59
<transcript>: This is a new thing to me. This T three. With it. T three. Does the environment variable typing.

02:22:06
<transcript>: Okay, let's see.

02:22:10
<transcript>: Sign in.

02:22:12
<transcript>: Twitter.

02:22:16
<transcript>: What'd we get same failure could not authenticate you.

02:22:20
<transcript>: It's not even taking me. It's not even trying to go.

02:22:25
<transcript>: It's not even trying to navigate me.

02:22:28
<transcript>: Why is that.

02:22:33
<transcript>: A warning. Next author.

02:22:36
<transcript>: That's fine.

02:22:45
<transcript>: Maybe I need to express explicitly set the next talk URL to localhost.

02:22:50
<transcript>: Like why is it's not even redirecting me? It's not even getting to the point of.

02:22:50
<transcript>: sending

02:22:52
<transcript>: Sending me.

02:22:56
<transcript>: You know I'm saying like it's not sending me to the.

02:22:57
allcliffs: @daglee 1) talked with VP and HR about personal traits. 2) talked with VP and PM about working style, management style, how to solve team isssues, when do you get annoyed, how do you give criticism to others ...

02:23:04
<transcript>: Twitter. Oh, off page. So it's not a Twitter error. I think this is the next auth error. And I think.

02:23:11
<transcript>: Does the create P three? Does this have documentation on Nexos.

02:23:15
<transcript>: Maybe I'm missing a piece here.

02:23:15
<transcript>: oh

02:23:18
<transcript>: Oh, I am missing a piece. Am I missing a piece? Wait, no.

02:23:21
<transcript>: This is all there.

02:23:21
<transcript>: session

02:23:22
cmjio: did it previously auth correctly? it could be a cookie issue thinkig your already authed

02:23:23
<transcript>: Session provider.

02:23:32
<transcript>: Usage with TRPC.

02:23:38
<transcript>: Usage. You should just Prisma.

02:23:47
cmjio: check it in incognito

02:23:48
<transcript>: Jot session strategy. Oh, I want to do the job. Session strategy for sure.

02:23:53
<transcript>: Oh, it's it's default Database strategy.

02:24:03
<transcript>: I mean, I still want to persist today, I guess. But I thought I'd do the Jaunt strategy. Maybe not. Maybe I shouldn't do the job strategy setting up the default discord provider.

02:24:03
<transcript>: so let's see what

02:24:06
<transcript>: So let's see what they say. Go to Oop, general.

02:24:08
<transcript>: Client secret.

02:24:17
<transcript>: Click Add Redirect and Paste in their API off Callback Disc. Oh, it's callback discord Oh.

02:24:17
<transcript>: i mess that up

02:24:20
<transcript>: I mess that up for sure.

02:24:24
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:24:31
<transcript>: I definitely miss that up. Let's see. Callback.

02:24:39
<transcript>: Oh, I messed it up in the Twitter configuration.

02:24:47
<transcript>: It should be callback, callback, Twitter.

02:24:53
<transcript>: All right.

02:24:58
<transcript>: I think it's a follow Hello.

02:24:58
<transcript>: hellota

02:25:00
<transcript>: Hellotalota.

02:25:06
<transcript>: Let's see. Did it previously off correctly? It could be a cookie issue thinking you're already off. Oh, maybe.

02:25:06
<transcript>: talk

02:25:11
<transcript>: Talk to the VPN HR. You're talking about your live long interview.

02:25:11
<transcript>: okay let's

02:25:13
<transcript>: Okay, let's save this.

02:25:17
daglee: @allcliffs But that is just bs? Real shit is like: What do you do when somebody forces you to rebase and 1300 lines of 1500 needs to be fixed?

02:25:18
<transcript>: Okay.

02:25:18
<transcript>: so

02:25:21
<transcript>: So that was an issue.

02:25:29
<transcript>: Callback Discord Saver Changes is possible, if not recommended, to use the same Discord application for the application.

02:25:31
<transcript>: Okay.

02:25:31
daglee: For you branch

02:25:34
<transcript>: Cool.

02:25:36
<transcript>: Let's.

02:25:41
<transcript>: Let's do this. Let's.

02:25:41
<transcript>: twitter

02:25:45
<transcript>: Twitter Provider Prism. Adapter.

02:25:47
<transcript>: Session.

02:25:56
<transcript>: Okay.

02:26:01
<transcript>: What's missing? Here.

02:26:03
allcliffs: @daglee you reject the PR and move on.

02:26:07
<transcript>: Put our client ID. Twitter client secret spelled those right.

02:26:09
<transcript>: Guess they're type safe so I would know.

02:26:18
<transcript>: Change something. Oh the callback URL is wrong.

02:26:22
<transcript>: So maybe that was the issue. Maybe it'll work now. Maybe.

02:26:27
daglee: It was forced push while you were sleeping.

02:26:33
<transcript>: Expect a message that would be a little more friendly, though, if that's what it was.

02:26:38
<transcript>: It's.

02:26:38
<transcript>: a slink

02:26:40
allcliffs: @daglee that is why you have backups ;)

02:26:41
<transcript>: A slink do it does a post.

02:26:45
<transcript>: Could not authenticate you.

02:26:45
<transcript>: no message

02:26:47
<transcript>: No message.

02:26:47
allcliffs: I can repush

02:26:52
<transcript>: Just a big error. Is that a debug mode in nexoff.

02:26:58
<transcript>: Next.

02:26:59
<transcript>: Logging.

02:27:05
<transcript>: Debug the true there we go.

02:27:21
<transcript>: Debug.

02:27:23
<transcript>: True.

02:27:30
<transcript>: There's something else I was thinking. I could try. And I can't remember what it was now.

02:27:38
<transcript>: I can't remember.

02:27:38
<transcript>: what it

02:27:40
<transcript>: What it was.

02:27:54
<transcript>: Oh, check it in Cognito that's right. You'd said I should check it. Cmj. Thank you so much. I'm gonna try that. Let's first I'm gonna try it one more time in debug mode. Just see there's more errors or something.

02:27:54
<transcript>: debug

02:27:56
<transcript>: Debug enabled.

02:27:58
<transcript>: And nothing else.

02:27:59
allcliffs: but to be honest mistakes happen and the way is to admit that you made them and that the team needs to fix them

02:28:03
<transcript>: Nothing else. The toastful here. So let's do it. Let's look at our.

02:28:08
<transcript>: I can just inspect real quick. I'm being curious. Like cookies.

02:28:10
<transcript>: Next sauce. Uhoh.

02:28:16
<transcript>: Yeah. Maybe I. Maybe I did. I don't. I don't know. Let's just clear all of it.

02:28:20
<transcript>: Just clear all of it.

02:28:20
<transcript>: clear site

02:28:22
<transcript>: Clear site data.

02:28:22
<transcript>: including

02:28:25
<transcript>: Including thirdparty cookies. Cleared all.

02:28:28
<transcript>: It could been from like.

02:28:28
<transcript>: no

02:28:30
<transcript>: No, that wouldn't be it.

02:28:32
<transcript>: Mouse Dragon.

02:28:38
<transcript>: Okay same error.

02:28:40
<transcript>: What a strange error.

02:28:43
<transcript>: Let's go to next off GitHub.

02:28:50
<transcript>: And let's just see.

02:28:52
<transcript>: Could.

02:28:52
<transcript>: not

02:28:59
<transcript>: Not authenticate you. I think this is an exhaust error. I don't think it's Twitter because I don't even think it's making it to Twitter.

02:29:03
<transcript>: Provider Mastodon.

02:29:05
o_fruit_o: Maybe because of the layoffs and resignations, someone from Twitter sabotaged it. LUL

02:29:14
<transcript>: What is happening here.

02:29:16
allcliffs: @o_fruit_o LUL

02:29:22
allcliffs: Elon broke auth

02:29:22
daglee: Yeah but I have heard stories about people having fights about who pushes first and who has to rebase.

02:29:24
<transcript>: Oh, Twitter authentication could not authenticate you. Hey, hey, this is it.

02:29:27
<transcript>: Elon broke off. Maybe.

02:29:29
<transcript>: Yeah. Maybe.

02:29:43
<transcript>: Must be a configuration error somewhere.

02:29:49
allcliffs: @daglee but that is why you have these discussions early on in the team to  agree what the working style is and what is the team values.

02:29:56
<transcript>: Those are the wrong keys. You should be using those. I can tell you that.

02:29:56
<transcript>: oh

02:30:01
<transcript>: Oh, if they were getting the same error because they were using the wrong keys, and maybe I'm using the wrong keys.

02:30:03
<transcript>: Maybe.

02:30:08
<transcript>: Like those are not. That's not the right keys. I'm pretty sure that.

02:30:14
<transcript>: You have to use the client ID in the client secret. Those are API keys.

02:30:15
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:30:18
<transcript>: Next last example.

02:30:21
<transcript>: It uses Twitter.

02:30:24
<transcript>: Signing with Twitter. Legacy.

02:30:24
<transcript>: it works

02:30:25
<transcript>: It works.

02:30:32
<transcript>: It works, it works? So I think it's my it must be my keys.

02:30:37
<transcript>: Must be my keys. Let's fix it.

02:30:37
<transcript>: does my app needs

02:30:38
<transcript>: Does my app needs to be like.

02:30:38
<transcript>: is it

02:30:41
<transcript>: Is it need to be approved or something.

02:30:44
<transcript>: Maybe.

02:30:44
<transcript>: let's just go to

02:30:47
<transcript>: Let's just go to our Twitter app here.

02:30:49
<transcript>: One more ink.

02:30:53
<transcript>: Tweet Tweets Elevated dashboard.

02:30:56
<transcript>: Aw guess production app.

02:30:59
<transcript>: Oh, I've made this in production.

02:31:05
<transcript>: It's a production app people.

02:31:05
<transcript>: authentic

02:31:07
<transcript>: Authentication methods.

02:31:11
<transcript>: Should I try version two? I could try version two.

02:31:16
<transcript>: Authentication allows you to log into your app with Twitter.

02:31:21
<transcript>: It also allows your optimic specific request authenticated users.

02:31:26
allcliffs: @daglee also this sounds like the tasks overlap too much if you are stepping on each other toes all the time.

02:31:50
<transcript>: Well.

02:31:50
<transcript>: let me go fuzzy

02:31:52
<transcript>: Let me go fuzzy.

02:31:56
<transcript>: And let me look at this environment file.

02:32:01
<transcript>: With a text editor just to make sure the values match up.

02:32:04
<transcript>: Now thanks for the follow.

02:32:06
<transcript>: Slicer.

02:32:15
allcliffs: hey your screen turned DOOM 1995

02:32:25
<transcript>: Local.

02:32:25
allcliffs: you need this for your face too :D

02:32:29
<transcript>: Hey, thanks so much for the prime subsume Jay.

02:32:29
<transcript>: thank

02:32:31
<transcript>: Thank you so much.

02:32:36
<transcript>: For my face too.

02:32:36
<transcript>: make my

02:32:37
cmjio: your welcome :)

02:32:40
<transcript>: Make my face all fuzzy? I bet I could actually no.

02:32:46
<transcript>: I really appreciate your prime sub. Also, thank you for the follow Vinny.

02:32:49
<transcript>: Oh, what's that done? Oh, yeah. I want to look.

02:32:56
<transcript>: Okay. There's our next update. Url.

02:32:59
<transcript>: There's our Twitter client, ID.

02:32:59
<transcript>: it matches

02:33:00
<transcript>: It matches.

02:33:03
<transcript>: Twitter client secret.

02:33:06
<transcript>: Also matches.

02:33:08
oskrm: howdy, I always catch you 2hours in LUL

02:33:10
<transcript>: So that shouldn't be the issue.

02:33:23
<transcript>: Maybe I need to set it to development mode.

02:33:27
<transcript>: We try that.

02:33:31
<transcript>: Oh, wait a minute.

02:33:34
<transcript>: Oh.

02:33:36
<transcript>: Wait a minute.

02:33:39
<transcript>: Is this somehow.

02:33:39
<transcript>: three

02:33:41
<transcript>: Three environments per project.

02:33:44
daglee: @allcliffs It shouldn't happen often but it can happen. I once wrote a change that changed almost every function in the whole project.

02:33:48
<transcript>: Okay. We're gonna make a standalone app. I think there's something about projects that I did not understand.

02:33:48
<transcript>: okay

02:33:51
<transcript>: Okay, let me let me close this file.

02:33:55
<transcript>: And we'll go back to I'll pick off fuzzy.

02:33:55
<transcript>: okay

02:33:57
<transcript>: Okay. So maybe.

02:33:57
<transcript>: let's just

02:33:59
<transcript>: Let's just create a standalone app.

02:34:04
<transcript>: New app here we go.

02:34:11
<transcript>: Eat this one.

02:34:12
daglee: Changing the memory handling model in C.

02:34:15
<transcript>: How do I delete it.

02:34:19
<transcript>: Delete app.

02:34:24
<transcript>: Deleted.

02:34:28
<transcript>: Oscars. Here.

02:34:31
<transcript>: You always get me 2 hours anyway I start pretty early.

02:34:37
allcliffs: @daglee again this is about making sure that the whole team knows and communicating this out.

02:34:38
<transcript>: I'm an early riser. Okay, we're gonna create a new app.

02:34:40
<transcript>: It's called AWS.

02:34:47
<transcript>: And they just drop those in there. They just don't even know I'm streaming.

02:34:50
<transcript>: Don't even know I'm streaming.

02:34:53
<transcript>: Okay, we're gonna set up this.

02:34:59
<transcript>: I'm gonna read. Maybe I needed to do the read and write. I don't know why that's really dumb.

02:35:02
<transcript>: But maybe.

02:35:02
<transcript>: it

02:35:03
<transcript>: It's a Web app.

02:35:07
<transcript>: Wait. Confidential. Client? What.

02:35:16
<transcript>: Levels of you I support by back end server, automated apps and bots are built to perform tasks. What's a confidential client versus a public client.

02:35:22
allcliffs: writing code is just a part of the job. communication is key to teams performance and collaboration between people.

02:35:23
<transcript>: This is not a native app.

02:35:28
<transcript>: Okay, let's try it.

02:35:37
<transcript>: Hello, local host.

02:35:39
<transcript>: Callback, Twitter.

<transcript>: We're going to console logins Twitter client ID somewhere.

02:37:54

02:38:30
<transcript>: oh you know what

02:38:39
<transcript>: just see if

02:38:44
<transcript>: Just see if that's actually got a value in it. Maybe it doesn't. That would be great if that's the issue.

02:38:49
<transcript>: That would be fantastic.

02:38:56
<transcript>: Does that sound good.

02:38:58
<transcript>: Did it, did it do it.

02:39:05
<transcript>: I don't know if it did it. Let's hit the page, man. It needs to hit the API route first.

02:39:06
tayloreddev: actually Mode Sonnet

<transcript>: It's not very helpful.

02:40:38
<transcript>: How could I log more information coming out of next auth.

02:40:44
<transcript>: Maybe I need to update next off. Let's do that. I also think like.

02:40:46
oskrm: same as the terminal

02:40:52
<transcript>: I updated next 13 to next 13? Did I not update? Oh, did I not update? That might be it.

02:40:52

02:41:14
<transcript>: maybe

02:41:15
<transcript>: Maybe.

02:41:15
<transcript>: it's possible

02:41:17
<transcript>: It's possible.

02:41:20
<transcript>: Razier things have happened.

02:41:24

02:41:24
<transcript>: sometimes

02:41:25
<transcript>: Sometimes.

02:41:25
<transcript>: this is

02:41:27
<transcript>: This is pretty unhelpful.

02:41:29
<transcript>: Now the next stop. Fan.

02:41:36
<transcript>: What am I supposed to do with.

02:41:36
<transcript>: nothing

02:41:37
<transcript>: Nothing.

02:41:37

02:41:42
<transcript>: What does that mean.

02:41:45
<transcript>: What does it mean.

02:41:45
<transcript>: what

02:41:45
oskrm: with pnpm you don't need to add "run", just pnpm dev

02:41:57
<transcript>: What does it mean? Why does it mean same as the tournament node in development? Would that be a problem with PMPM? You don't need to add run. Just PMPM. Dev. Is that true? I know I do that with yarn. I didn't know I could do that.

02:41:57
<transcript>: with pm

02:42:01
<transcript>: With PMPM. Is that actually facts.

02:42:07

02:42:19
<transcript>: at least we got

02:42:22
heywyer: LUL

02:42:24
<transcript>: At least we got that. But why is Twitter not working? Let's try 20, I guess.

02:42:31

02:43:30
<transcript>: Clank credentials. Here we go.

02:43:41
<transcript>: Api key. Our App key is equal to Apex E, which is the OAuth consumer key and OAuth consumer secret. So I need to use the API ones for version One. I'm dumb.

02:43:41
<transcript>: i think i'm just

02:43:45
<transcript>: I think I'm just dumb people. I think this is my fault.

02:43:47
<transcript>: I think it was my fault.

02:43:47
<transcript>: but

02:43:50
<transcript>: But that's good. If that works, let's try it.

02:44:54
<transcript>: And that's it PMPM run does.

02:44:57

02:45:49
<transcript>: It works. So I was using.

02:45:49
<transcript>: the

02:45:52
<transcript>: The I was using the OAuth 20.

02:45:52
<transcript>: client id and client

02:45:55
heywyer: jackpot

02:45:56
oskrm: Yep

02:46:00
<transcript>: Client ID and client secret. Not to be confused with API key in Secret, which apparently are used for OAuth 10 a.

02:46:02
<transcript>: But now.

02:46:02
<transcript>: now we're

02:46:07
<transcript>: Now we're good. Except we're not. Something didn't work. What didn't work.

02:46:07

02:46:25
oskrm: LUL LEAKED

shiftlessatol: #bigballofmud

02:46:31
<transcript>: That's what it appears.

<transcript>: i'm gonna have to write

02:46:35
<transcript>: I'm gonna have to write my own.

02:46:35
<transcript>: i think

02:46:43
<transcript>: I think I also leaked. Yeah, yeah. We leaked stuff. We leaked all the stuff, but it's because they logged it all.

02:46:49
<transcript>: Next off is going on my bad list soon look at this. All these errors.

02:47:07
<transcript>: do we

02:47:09
<transcript>: Do we try.

02:47:13

<transcript>: I'm sorry. Adapter.

02:47:24
<transcript>: Adapter.

02:47:24
<transcript>: prism

02:47:31
<transcript>: Prisma. So what's happening is the adapter. Prisma is not handling.

02:47:37
<transcript>: It's not handled.

02:47:46
<transcript>: The shape of the Twitter 10. I wonder if I should just use Twitter OAuth 20. I want to have email addresses. I don't know if I need them.

02:47:46
<transcript>: i don't

02:47:49
<transcript>: I don't need them. I guess.

02:47:52
<transcript>: I don't know what I would do with them.

02:47:58
shiftlessatol: console.log =>  how to invalidate all the careful effort you spent trying to prevent displaying sensitive information

02:48:01
<transcript>: But then if I use like Discord, I will get email for discord. Probably. So it'll be weird to have some users where we don't have an email address.

02:48:12
<transcript>: Oh, I have it on debug mode. That's why it's leaking all this stuff so badly. Yeah, that's what's going on.

02:48:16
<transcript>: It is helpful though, so I can see exactly what's breaking down.

02:48:20
<transcript>: Just look at this. So.

02:48:23
<transcript>: So much information leaked.

02:48:23
<transcript>: basically

02:48:28
<transcript>: Basically all of my PII. Basically everything about me has been leaked now.

02:48:28
<transcript>: awesome

02:48:29
<transcript>: Awesome.

02:48:31
<transcript>: Twitter.

02:48:31
<transcript>: com

02:48:32
<transcript>: Com.

02:48:35
<transcript>: So it's failing.

02:48:37

02:48:37
<transcript>: document

02:48:41
<transcript>: Document Validate account Unchecked Create input.

02:48:48
<transcript>: So let's look, does it have like its own Prisma schema? I guess.

02:48:50
<transcript>: How's this work.

02:48:53
<transcript>: Schema.

02:49:01
<transcript>: User account. See? It has access token. A refresh token. Those are optional.

02:49:01
<transcript>: but

02:49:03
<transcript>: But it doesn't have.

02:49:05

02:49:27

02:49:31
<transcript>: Should be in this schema and it is not.

02:49:31
<transcript>: can the prism

02:49:33
<transcript>: Can the Prisma adapter.

02:49:33
<transcript>: question

02:49:36
<transcript>: Question, Can the Prisma adapter.

02:49:43
<transcript>: Can you configure it with a different with your own schema.

02:49:50
<transcript>: Create the prison scheme that you need at least prison. 22626. Create a Schema file in prismus.

02:49:55
<transcript>: Seems adapted to use for use imprisonment based on our main schema.

02:49:55

02:51:15
lukeyfam15: How are you today?

02:51:20
<transcript>: It says in here. Yeah, right here. Oh, I'll talk token secret. You won't receive an access token.

02:51:25
<transcript>: Remember to add these to your database schema. So I just need to do that.

02:51:35
<transcript>: Is that going to work? Maybe.

02:51:36
<transcript>: Oh.

02:51:36
<transcript>: token

02:51:38

02:52:11
<transcript>: I haven't used the Twitter provider for next off. Yeah, I had neither his first time. I've used Google, and I've used a few of the other ones, but I guess I've used GitHub.

02:53:14
<transcript>: Bananas. Here as well. Hello, Banana. How are you, Luki's? Good, that's good.

02:53:16
<transcript>: So let's go.

02:53:18
<transcript>: Let's do this.

02:53:19
allcliffs: @adamdotdev why do we need a login? doing a leaderboard ?

02:53:28
<transcript>: We we added those two fields. We're gonna do like MPX. I'm gonna pretend like I know something about Bresma. Here. We're gonna say impacts.

02:53:28
<transcript>: first we're gonna

02:53:30
<transcript>: First we're gonna say.

02:53:35
<transcript>: We're gonna say MPX Prisma.

02:53:44
heywyer: migrate db

02:53:45
<transcript>: Migrate Prisma DB push.

02:54:35
<transcript>: Not that one.

02:54:37
<transcript>: Let's just clear it.

02:54:44
<transcript>: Also, I'm wondering, do I want to use the Jot strategy, or do I want to use the database session strategy.

02:54:48
<transcript>: I guess the database session strategy is fine.

02:55:03
<transcript>: Anyone have opinions on that? I wish next we're here. Next we'll have opinions. Why do we need to login doing leaderboard DLS right off list. We're building the leaderboard. That's the only reason I need off so you can save your place on the leaderboard.

03:00:31
<transcript>: probably

03:00:34
<transcript>: Probably safe bet.

03:00:36
<transcript>: Let's let's try.

03:00:36
<transcript>: so i'm gonna

03:00:38
<transcript>: So I'm gonna set the timer back.

03:00:42
<transcript>: Let's see index.

03:00:50
<transcript>: Let's see the timer is actually.

03:00:54
<transcript>: I turn off the DevTools. I did right for the state machine.

03:00:57
<transcript>: Somewhere. Yeah, I think so.

03:01:01
<transcript>: Yeah. I got rid of all that. So that's good.

03:01:04
<transcript>: And I'm just gonna delete all this now.

03:01:04
<transcript>: let's start

03:01:08
<transcript>: Let's start cleaning up, you know, it's kind of a mess around here.

03:01:11
<transcript>: That's not it.

03:01:19
<transcript>: Okay.

03:01:22
<transcript>: Those Dev tools. There we go.

03:01:24
<transcript>: State.

03:01:34
<transcript>: Okay.

03:01:37
<transcript>: Let's do this.

03:01:39
<transcript>: Let.

03:01:42
<transcript>: Reset the timer, the game router.

03:01:45
<transcript>: 45.

03:01:48
<transcript>: So this is going to be.

03:01:50
<transcript>: At.

03:01:57
<transcript>: And we're gonna build a leaderboard. It's about time.

03:02:05
<transcript>: It is about time to build a leaderboard. Okay, so you finish a game. We'll just play a game real quick.

03:02:07
<transcript>: Whoa.

03:02:07
<transcript>: just do

03:02:09
<transcript>: Just do a hot module reload.

03:02:11
<transcript>: I think so.

03:02:15
<transcript>: Believe so new game Here we go.

03:02:25
<transcript>: So you've got this 45 2nd timer. If you get stuff wrong, you lose time. I got that right. So I got 5 seconds.

03:02:28
<transcript>: Sink box. What is that? Yeah. Mq.

03:02:49
<transcript>: How long can I keep this going? If I just keep getting answers right.

03:02:49
<transcript>: i keep getting five

03:02:51
bonnjaevel: Sweet looking UI, kudos

03:02:56
<transcript>: I keep getting five more seconds, but it does take like 2 seconds. Oh, that's another thing. I want to change. We'll do it later. I want to do the leaderboard right now.

03:02:56
<transcript>: application

03:02:58
<transcript>: Application Cost profiler.

03:03:01
<transcript>: What is that? What is that.

03:03:06
<transcript>: Iot robora no so I lost 5 seconds.

03:03:10
<transcript>: Local zones. I got 5 seconds back.

03:03:16
<transcript>: Just drove for open telemetry.

03:03:24

<transcript>: Keeping it alive.

03:03:39
<transcript>: Code Whisper, just like Copilot, but made by Amazon. Oh, we're getting close now. Security hub.

03:03:41
<transcript>: It's taken down.

03:03:45
<transcript>: Server.

03:03:50
<transcript>: No. Okay, so game over. This is the page right here. Game over.

03:03:50
<transcript>: thanks

03:03:52
<transcript>: Thanks, bonjval.

03:03:52
<transcript>: bonjay

03:03:54
<transcript>: Bonjay Banja.

03:04:09
<transcript>: We're making progress. So this game overstate. We want to navigate the score on here, and then we want to have an option. If you want to save that score and you're not logged in, you're gonna be able to log in with Twitter and save your score to the leaderboard. Make sense.

03:04:09
<transcript>: let's do it

03:04:10
<transcript>: Let's do it.

03:04:15
<transcript>: So go back to Index. Thank you so much for the follow meat. Zeveiri.

03:04:18
<transcript>: Let's go to game over.

03:04:21
<transcript>: Game over.

03:04:21
<transcript>: over

03:04:22
<transcript>: Over.

03:04:28
<transcript>: So here this is our game over page. We should really bust these out into separate components.

03:04:28
<transcript>: but

03:04:29
<transcript>: But.

03:04:32
<transcript>: So far, just not doing that.

03:04:32
<transcript>: there

03:04:34
<transcript>: There is a new game button.

03:04:41
<transcript>: Yeah. I want to have this as a separate thing, right.

03:04:43
<transcript>: Separate component.

03:04:52
<transcript>: I should really have like a switch statement in here that switches based on like game over idol or active.

03:05:00
<transcript>: Like this should just be a big giant switch statement. Can you even do that actually.

03:05:00
<transcript>: i'm getting set

03:05:03
<transcript>: I'm getting set sidetracked can I switch.

03:05:05
<transcript>: On.

03:05:07
<transcript>: Current.

03:05:10
<transcript>: Dot, what.

03:05:18
<transcript>: Can I even do that? Can you switch in a react component.

03:05:21
<transcript>: React.

03:05:21
<transcript>: x

03:05:23
<transcript>: X Eight switch.

03:05:26
<transcript>: On match.

03:05:29
<transcript>: Thing you can do.

03:05:43
<transcript>: Let's see how.

03:05:43
<transcript>: log rocket

03:05:45
<transcript>: Log Rocket says you should do it.

03:05:45
<transcript>: can you switch

03:05:46
<transcript>: Can you switch.

03:05:59
<transcript>: Anyone done that in React I've never had like a switch statement control which component was.

03:05:59
<transcript>: this

03:06:00
<transcript>: This visible.

03:06:09
<transcript>: I feel like that'd be the better way to do it. Like you should only render one of these things.

03:06:15
<transcript>: Maybe not.

03:06:15
<transcript>: maybe

03:06:17
<transcript>: Maybe not.

03:06:28
<transcript>: Whatever. Okay, I'm over it.

03:06:28
<transcript>: so

03:06:31
<transcript>: So game over state. Here's what we know we need.

03:06:34
<transcript>: Game over Div, and then we need.

03:06:44
<transcript>: Your current score.

03:06:50
<transcript>: So let's do let's do one parent Div.

03:06:56
<transcript>: Let's have a divide that.

03:06:59
<transcript>: What did that do.

03:07:12
<transcript>: Restarted everything. Yeah. Yeah. So we need to just, like, start on Game over so I can just style this thing, but it won't have a if I start on game over, there won't be an actual.

03:07:12
<transcript>: just gonna

03:07:17
<transcript>: Just gonna do this. We're just gonna get a zero score, or I would get one point or something.

03:07:21
<transcript>: Game left and then I get all wrong answers.

03:07:21
<transcript>: wrong answer

03:07:22
<transcript>: Wrong answers only.

03:07:27
<transcript>: I can't test it, though.

03:07:27
<transcript>: i

03:07:29
<transcript>: I can't I can't.

03:07:29
<transcript>: save the

03:07:32
<transcript>: Save the page or.

03:07:39
<transcript>: Right. Like if I save the page, it's gonna go back to the beginning. This is the problem with the way this app works.

03:07:44
<transcript>: Okay, it's gonna go into game overstate.

03:07:45
dedadev: wow that is so nice project

03:07:50
<transcript>: And here this is where I'm trying to change. I want to add the score.

03:07:50
<transcript>: div

03:07:51
<transcript>: Div.

03:07:54
<transcript>: Content or current.

03:07:54
<transcript>: contact

03:07:55
<transcript>: Contact.

03:07:58
<transcript>: Result or no.

03:08:00
dedadev: would be useful for learning for the cert

03:08:01
<transcript>: Score.

03:08:11
<transcript>: This is a terrible feedback loop. I can't play a new game every time I want to change the screen. All right, we gotta fix it. We gotta fix this thing.

03:08:13
<transcript>: We got to.

03:08:13
<transcript>: we

03:08:19
<transcript>: We have to fix it now. I just got to get wrong answers to get to act the end. I just wanted to see if that actually worked.

03:08:19
<transcript>: how can i

03:08:24
<transcript>: How can I. How can I maintain the state even if you refresh your page? How can I do it.

03:08:24
<transcript>: wow that is

03:08:34
<transcript>: Wow, that is so nice. Project would be useful for learning for the Cert. Hey, yeah, I think it's pretty fun to play with and just like give you familiarity with more AWS services.

03:08:39
<transcript>: It's also open source. It's on GitHub. If you want to look at the actual code.

03:08:41
<transcript>: That'll be helpful.

03:08:41
<transcript>: game over

03:08:45
bonnjaevel: I think you can switch if you wrap it in an IIFE but I would do a switch component I think

03:08:46
<transcript>: Game over there's. Our score. It's a one now I need to be able to style this page.

03:08:57
<transcript>: We've got to persist the state somehow and rehydrate the machine with the state. We have to it's just a must.

03:08:57
<transcript>: let's close

03:09:00
<transcript>: Let's close all this.

03:09:06
<transcript>: Close all of this.

03:09:09
dedadev: which AWS certifications you have?

03:09:12
<transcript>: Okay.

03:09:12
<transcript>: so what

03:09:18
<transcript>: So what I want is this I want to do this will start the service at the specified state.

03:09:24
<transcript>: Also maintain and restore previous history States. Ensure that events and expense represents the correct values.

03:09:24
<transcript>: so

03:09:30
<transcript>: So here. Where are they saving? Thank you for follow, erase.

03:09:32
<transcript>: Did a week.

03:09:32
<transcript>: certifications you

03:09:40
<transcript>: Certifications. You have I have all of them. I think they came out with an SAP Cert, and I don't have that one, but I've got twelve of them. I've got the.

03:09:47
<transcript>: All of the current ones, except for SAP. And then I have the Alexa Skill Builder. I got it before it retired.

03:09:56
<transcript>: I think you can switch it if you wrap it in one of those things. In those weird function things. I would just switch component, I think. Yeah, that makes more sense.

03:10:04
<transcript>: Okay. So we want to persist our X state. Who has ever persisted X state.

03:10:04
<transcript>: state

03:10:08
<transcript>: State Anybody, Anybody here ever done this.

03:10:08
<transcript>: they're saying

03:10:17
dedadev: Are you kidding me? That is years of learning

03:10:20
<transcript>: They're saying you just a state object can be persisted by serializing it to a JSON format. What is a state object? I think I'm misunderstanding what current state is. So if I go.

03:10:23
<transcript>: Context.

03:10:25
<transcript>: Here.

03:10:27
dedadev: took me 3 months for Cloud Pratictioner

03:10:30
<transcript>: I get the state. Is that what current is.

03:10:36
<transcript>: This state. Yeah, this is a state object. So I can they're saying I should be able to persist.

03:10:38
<transcript>: This thing.

03:10:41
<transcript>: Right.

03:10:41
<transcript>: should be able to

03:10:43
<transcript>: Should be able to.

03:10:48
<transcript>: Build a store current.

03:10:51
<transcript>: In local storage.

03:10:58
<transcript>: And restore it.

03:11:00
<transcript>: When the page loads.

03:11:05
<transcript>: Does use machine.

03:11:09
<transcript>: So let's see use machine.

03:11:13
<transcript>: React.

03:11:13
<transcript>: use

03:11:15
<transcript>: Use machine.

03:11:17
<transcript>: Restore.

03:11:29
<transcript>: Can I do that.

03:11:35
<transcript>: Restore persisted state and react that's not gonna be X state, is it.

03:11:35
<transcript>: thanks so much for

03:11:38
<transcript>: Thanks so much for the follow Blight club.

03:11:43
<transcript>: Bonjuval are you kidding me? This is years of learning took me three months for clappite user so.

03:11:43
<transcript>: a few

03:11:45
<transcript>: A few things you should know.

03:11:45
<transcript>: first of all

03:11:50
<transcript>: First of all, is this using XD. It is using X. Eight. Oh, hey, this is it.

03:11:54
<transcript>: This is the Holy Grail. We found it. I'll take a moment, then.

03:12:09
<transcript>: A few things you should know. One. I've been building on AWS for like eight years, so I took the certs having had a lot of experience on AWS. I had to do a lot of studying because the search cover a lot of stuff I don't use, but I had a lot of context.

03:12:24
<transcript>: So there's that also I'm really good at taking tests like that's not I'm gonna I'm gonna try to flex like it's a weird thing to be good at, but I just am I think I'm really good at multiple choice tests. That's why I think I'm good at my own stupid. Aw, guest game.

03:12:30
<transcript>: Yeah. So I did all the search in, like, a sixweek period. So I took, like two a week for six weeks.

03:12:30
<transcript>: and got all

03:12:35
<transcript>: And got all twelve. Aws, certs. It was more of a parlor trick. Like, almost, like.

03:12:35
<transcript>: pointing out

03:12:44
<transcript>: Pointing out that it can be gamed a little bit that you can like cram and pass these multiple choice tests.

03:12:44
<transcript>: in a way

03:12:50
neochromer: @adamdotdev did you had multiple choice tests where if you don't select all correct answers you fail?

03:12:57
neochromer: thats how it was at my college

03:13:03
<transcript>: In a way that kind of just discredits them. Almost. I didn't mean I'm not trying to, like, Bro shade on certifications. I've never had to use them for any real reasons. Like I've never applied for a job, so they've never come in handy for me. In that way. I don't know what value they have out there. I did it kind of for the fun ZS. Does that make sense? It was like a hard challenge.

03:13:03
<transcript>: neoc

03:13:09
<transcript>: Neocromer Did you have multiple choice tests? Where if you don't select all correct answers, you fail.

03:13:09
<transcript>: yeah so

03:13:15
<transcript>: Yeah. So the AWS Certs do have some of those, like, select all the supply. So it's not like one out of four. It's like.

03:13:15
<transcript>: choose any of

03:13:17
neochromer: I hate those

03:13:28
dedadev: but they look great on the LinkedIn profile :)

03:13:35
<transcript>: Choose any of them that apply. And some of those certs are legitimately hard tests like the A tos professional or the Architect Professional Solutions Architect professional. That one's tough like each is the questions as a paragraph and each of the answers of the paragraph and you have to read a lot of information. It's a long test. It's like 3 hours of just like it's pretty grueling, but.

03:13:39
<transcript>: Yeah. I mean, I did them all in six weeks. I.

03:13:39
<transcript>: be

03:13:43
<transcript>: Be they look great on the LinkedIn profile. Exactly.

03:13:44
grasp5533: Did you use AWS IQ much?

03:13:46
<transcript>: Okay, so here we go serialized state.

03:13:46
<transcript>: local

03:13:51
<transcript>: Local swords get item. They're doing this outside of the react components. You see that.

03:13:51
<transcript>: they're actually

03:13:56
<transcript>: They're actually serialized. They're getting the serialized state outside here.

03:13:56
<transcript>: and then let

03:14:01
<transcript>: And then let previously is serialized previously equals JSON parse.

03:14:01
<transcript>: and then

03:14:05
<transcript>: And then causal error. Okay. Interesting. So this is.

03:14:12
<transcript>: Different than when I was doing so previous state. Now here they pass that into use machine.

03:14:12
<transcript>: immediat

03:14:16
<transcript>: Immediate false service. Start immediately.

03:14:16
<transcript>: before

03:14:18
<transcript>: Before Mount.

03:14:18
<transcript>: oh interesting

03:14:20
<transcript>: Oh, interesting. Is there a reason they did that.

03:14:20
<transcript>: on trans

03:14:24
<transcript>: On transition? Oh, they're doing on every transition.

03:14:26
<transcript>: Nice.

03:14:28
<transcript>: On transition.

03:14:28
<transcript>: they set

03:14:31
<transcript>: They set the sword state, this is fantastic.

03:14:35
<transcript>: Fetch resolve project.

03:14:37
<transcript>: Okay.

03:14:42
<transcript>: What's this previous state.

03:14:45
<transcript>: Now value.

03:14:48
<transcript>: I love this.

03:14:48
<transcript>: i

03:14:52
<transcript>: I love this example. They just. They did it. They saved me.

03:14:52
<transcript>: if it works

03:14:54
<transcript>: If it works and we'll see if it works.

03:14:56
<transcript>: Okay.

03:14:59
<transcript>: Let's paste it right down here.

03:15:03
dedadev: Is it possible to deploy Next.js app as serverless?

03:15:05
<transcript>: Series, state local storage gititem and we're gonna say that's gonna be.

03:15:08
<transcript>: We'll call it.

03:15:12
<transcript>: Github.

03:15:15
<transcript>: Machine.

03:15:18
<transcript>: In case I have more.

03:15:18
<transcript>: machines

03:15:20
<transcript>: Machines at some point.

03:15:20
<transcript>: so

03:15:21
<transcript>: So then previous day.

03:15:21
<transcript>: console

03:15:24
<transcript>: Console error. Previous state. Okay.

03:15:27
<transcript>: Prestige. There we go.

03:15:27
<transcript>: and then

03:15:34
<transcript>: And then down here they're gonna say use machine they're gonna pass in previous state.

03:15:37
<transcript>: Wait. It's.

03:15:37
<transcript>: a state

03:15:38
<transcript>: A state.

03:15:38
<transcript>: previous

03:15:40
<transcript>: Previous state.

03:15:40
<transcript>: and

03:15:43
<transcript>: And immediate false.

03:15:43
<transcript>: is that

03:15:44
<transcript>: Is that necessary.

03:15:48
<transcript>: What's wrong? I.

03:15:59
<transcript>: Guess I need to type it up here.

03:15:59
<transcript>: what

03:16:01
<transcript>: What is a.

03:16:01
<transcript>: what

03:16:03
<transcript>: What is this.

03:16:03
<transcript>: well that's just a string

03:16:06
<transcript>: Well, that's just a string. What should this be Typed.

03:16:08
<transcript>: State.

03:16:12
<transcript>: I have to have generics, I guess.

03:16:15
<transcript>: Okay.

03:16:17
<transcript>: The State machine.

03:16:21
<transcript>: I.

03:16:26
<transcript>: What is generic here.

03:16:32
<transcript>: Oh, come on.

03:16:32
<transcript>: t

03:16:34
<transcript>: T context T event.

03:16:42
<transcript>: Tstate schema. I think I just did this up here, right? Thanks so much for follow Mr. Rios and White club.

03:16:42
<transcript>: let's

03:16:50
<transcript>: Let's see certs in general is the strange girl. I have no value unless the state is involved. Doctors, teachers, etc.

03:16:50
<transcript>: did you use

03:16:57
<transcript>: Did you use a tobisq much I did grasp like a year for the year after I got all the certs.

03:16:57
<transcript>: i

03:17:04
<transcript>: I just did, like independent consulting on AWS, like you. I mean, well, not just on IEPs IQ, but I was just an independent AWS consultant.

03:17:04
<transcript>: and

03:17:07
<transcript>: And I Cube was a big part of that.

03:17:07
<transcript>: is it

03:17:11
<transcript>: Is it possible to deploy an XJS app as serverless.

03:17:11
<transcript>: yeah

03:17:13
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:17:13
<transcript>: it

03:17:18
<transcript>: It's a dead a Dev did it Eve it's. I mean, it's serverless by default on Versail. Right.

03:17:35
<transcript>: So that's like the easiest way to deploy it as serverless. But even Amplify Hosting Now, yesterday they announced you can deploy to Amplifier hosting. Netlify would be a service option. I think by default people mostly deploy Next apps as serverless. So here we go. These are what I want.

03:17:38
<transcript>: We're going to just do like that.

03:17:39
dedadev: I thought on AWS

03:17:41
<transcript>: And then we're gonna do like this.

03:17:43
grasp5533: PreInvent has been on fire this year

03:17:47
<transcript>: Okay, so that's previous state immediate fall is no good. What's wrong.

03:17:52
<transcript>: We're gonna type. Is that not a thing anymore? Maybe it's not.

03:18:02
<transcript>: I don't know why they do that might have been a detail that's only pertinent for their thing. We are gonna copy this though. This is fantastic, so I can have it automatically persist.

03:18:06
<transcript>: And have it automatically for Sys.

03:18:14
<transcript>: Service on transition.

03:18:14
woycieszko: Hey Adam, how are you ?

03:18:19
<transcript>: Okay.

03:18:22
benanna19: SST I believe deploys to your AWS. Flightcontrol also deploys Nextjs apps to your AWS

03:18:25
<transcript>: Try local storage set item stored state that's not the name.

03:18:25
<transcript>: that's not

03:18:27
<transcript>: That's not the name.

03:18:27
<transcript>: it's

03:18:29
<transcript>: It's games.

03:18:29
<transcript>: mach

03:18:30
<transcript>: Machine.

03:18:35
<transcript>: Okay, let's try it. It's worth a shot.

03:18:38
<transcript>: Give him run, Dev.

03:18:38
<transcript>: if this works

03:18:44
<transcript>: If this works, I'm gonna be a happy person. This will mean page refreshes. Don't break.

03:18:44
<transcript>: game

03:18:46
<transcript>: Game state.

03:18:48
<transcript>: Local search is not defined.

03:18:53
<transcript>: So this is a.

03:18:55
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:19:00
<transcript>: I can't just do that right? I can't just say, oh, well, I can.

03:19:03
<transcript>: Let's see, I can let's see.

03:19:07
<transcript>: Little. Right down here. Where is it.

03:19:10
pogjar: if window exists ?

03:19:15
<transcript>: I can do it if I only do it in the client.

03:19:15
<transcript>: right

03:19:16
<transcript>: Right.

03:19:18
pogjar: no local storage server side

03:19:21
<transcript>: So if I only do this code.

03:19:22
woycieszko: try if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {

03:19:26
<transcript>: Here if type of.

03:19:29
<transcript>: Type of window.

03:19:39
<transcript>: It doesn't equal, right.

03:19:43
<transcript>: Right.

03:19:52
<transcript>: Like that? Can I do that now? Is it gonna give errors? Is it gonna say.

03:19:52
<transcript>: that the

03:19:57
woycieszko: yes

03:19:58
<transcript>: That the backend rendered something that doesn't match the front end. Like Hydration errors. I don't know. Probably.

03:19:58
<transcript>: we'll just

03:20:00
<transcript>: We'll just cross that Ridge. If we get there.

03:20:00
pogjar: yes

03:20:03
pogjar: probably

03:20:03
<transcript>: Yes.

03:20:15
<transcript>: Voices agrees. Hey, wishy something. Well, Preinvent has been on fire. This us, right, Grass? Anybody going to reinvent? I keep asking this. I've asked all throughout the stream.

03:20:15
<transcript>: anybody

03:20:23
grasp5533: I wish I was going haha

03:20:23
pogjar: HYDRATION we like this

03:20:25
<transcript>: Anybody want to reinvent Banana SSD? I believe deploys your AWS flight controls to place next to S apps to your AWS. If Windows exist, no local stores.

03:20:27
grasp5533: I need a job that will send me

03:20:30
<transcript>: Wish you were going grass. I wish you were too. I'd love to meet you.

03:20:30
<transcript>: hydration

03:20:32
<transcript>: Hydration.

03:20:32
<transcript>: we like

03:20:34
<transcript>: We like this.

03:20:38
<transcript>: Okay. Here we are. It's working so far.

03:20:38
<transcript>: let's pull up

03:20:40
<transcript>: Let's pull up our host.

03:20:45
<transcript>: Let's pull up our application tab. Let's look at our local storage.

03:20:48
pogjar: wow this thing looks really nice!

03:20:51
pogjar: love the ui

03:20:51
ohmymndy: Talking about hydration, is the water bucket still a thing? Or was that only for  a day or two?

03:20:52
<transcript>: Game machine state it's actually in there. Let's see if I let's just let's get some things right here.

03:20:52
<transcript>: is that ashram

03:20:54
<transcript>: Is that Ashram? Yes.

03:20:58
dedadev: 2.5k warnings

03:21:00
<transcript>: Still feels good to get a good score on my own game still feels good.

03:21:09
<transcript>: Something's. A lot of work, but we're making progress. Okay, so then if I refresh the page, what happens.

03:21:16
<transcript>: Initial UI does not match what was rendered on the server. How do I fix that.

03:21:16
neochromer: haha

03:21:18
<transcript>: How do I fix it.

03:21:25
<transcript>: And general this issue. I'm gonna actually open it in the same browser here.

03:21:36
<transcript>: Possible is fix Cosby using a Civic Library application. I know why it's happening.

03:21:37
pogjar: can disable the ssr for it

03:21:39
<transcript>: Yep.

03:21:42
<transcript>: How to fix it.

03:21:47
<transcript>: During hydration use effect is called window is available in News effect.

03:21:56
<transcript>: In order to prevent the first render from being different, I can use effect so we just delay.

03:21:56
<transcript>: okay

03:21:58
<transcript>: Okay, let's try this.

03:22:03
<transcript>: Let's try this. So down here.

03:22:03
<transcript>: no

03:22:04
neochromer: @adamdotdev do you have a conditional rendering?

03:22:07
<transcript>: No, we can't do that. I can't use machine in a use effect.

03:22:11
<transcript>: Bummer, do you have a conditional rendering.

03:22:11
<transcript>: can

03:22:12
neochromer: or do you do show/hide?

03:22:13
woycieszko: try import with dynamic() => import

03:22:14
<transcript>: Can disable the SSR for it.

03:22:23
<transcript>: Two 5000 warnings. What are you seeing? Those. Oh, the. It's just I don't have it wiping out the console, that's all.

03:22:23
<transcript>: let's preserve

03:22:26
<transcript>: Let's preserve. Yeah, let's turn that off.

03:22:31
<transcript>: Mandy's here talking about Hydration. Is.

03:22:31
<transcript>: the

03:22:33
<transcript>: The water.

03:22:36
neochromer: So the issue I had with hydration is because I "show" a div which initially is not in the DOM

03:22:44
<transcript>: Bucket still a thing. Or we that only for a day or two. I did for a day. The bowl. I did the bowl for a day. Cuz Binja kind of started a thing, but it was just so big on my desk. It just annoyed me.

03:22:49
<transcript>: So Candaceable, the SSR for it.

03:22:51
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:22:51
<transcript>: i guess

03:22:54
<transcript>: I guess. How would we do that? It's a next page.

03:23:01
<transcript>: So they do render it on the server. It's pretty undernecessary. We don't need it right. It on the server.

03:23:01
<transcript>: so how can i just

03:23:03
<transcript>: So how can I just disable SSR.

03:23:03
<transcript>: is that a thing

03:23:05
<transcript>: Is that a thing you can do.

03:23:06
bonnjaevel: 'use client' ?

03:23:09
<transcript>: So another example.

03:23:15
bonnjaevel: does that only work in new app directory?

03:23:16
<transcript>: Using style components.

03:23:26
<transcript>: Use client. Well, this is not the App directory. Yeah, that only works in the App directory.

03:23:32
<transcript>: The issue you had with Hydration is because I show a Div.

03:23:32
<transcript>: which is

03:23:35
<transcript>: Which is initially not in the Dom.

03:23:41
<transcript>: Try import with dynamic. So the problem the question I have I guess.

03:23:44
<transcript>: It's this.

03:23:44
<transcript>: oh

03:23:52
<transcript>: Oh, we just went, did we just go from Dirty Work to Leroyband Brown? Bad, Bad Leeway Brown.

03:23:55
<transcript>: We're in the 70s right now, the.

03:23:55
<transcript>: america

03:23:56
<transcript>: America.

03:23:56
<transcript>: feels good

03:24:04
<transcript>: Feels good at this playlist, so I guess it keeps on giving. So the problem I have is it's this used machine hook. I'm passing in a previous state.

03:24:04
<transcript>: on the client

03:24:07
<transcript>: On the client, but not on the server.

03:24:11
<transcript>: And the problem with that is.

03:24:18
<transcript>: I don't know how to use dynamic.

03:24:24
woycieszko: https://www.folkstalk.com/2022/09/next-js-disable-ssr-with-code-examples-2.html

03:24:30
<transcript>: Like, I don't know how to make this part dynamic. Like, only run on the client. Like, I basically don't want this used machine to run on the search.

03:24:32
<transcript>: Can I disable it.

03:24:35
<transcript>: Let's see. Ssr.

03:24:41
<transcript>: X eight, react the same SSR.

03:24:46
shiftlessatol: "I felt better in my 20's during the 70's than I do in my 70s during the 20's"

03:24:52
<transcript>: How do I disable.

03:24:56
<transcript>: It's all it next is always going to run on the server, right.

03:25:12
<transcript>: Suppress Hydration. Warning. That's a thing.

03:25:18
<transcript>: Yeah. Can I just ignore it.

03:25:27
neochromer: @adamdotdev google import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

03:25:30
<transcript>: Let's see disable SSR code examples. Is that the one I'm looking at? Maybe not. I felt better in my 20s during the do.

03:25:30
<transcript>: in my

03:25:38
shiftlessatol: ~ Joe Walsh

03:25:39
neochromer: dynamic(   () => import('../components/helloWorld'),   { ssr: false } )

03:25:39
<transcript>: In my 70s during the 20s. What? I'm so confused, Dave New York Rhemer Google Import Dynamic from Next I am yeah, I use Next dynamic quite a bit.

03:25:41
<transcript>: Import dynamic.

03:25:43
<transcript>: From.

03:25:49
<transcript>: Next dynamic. My question is how I do that. It's just a hook that I need to not.

03:25:49
<transcript>: run

03:25:50
woycieszko: if you wanna exaple

03:25:51
<transcript>: Run on the server.

03:25:51
<transcript>: i don't know

03:25:51
woycieszko: const DynamicComponentWithNoSSR = dynamic(() => import('../components/List'), {   ssr: false })

03:25:55
<transcript>: I don't know how I would do that. I guess I could move all of this into a component.

03:26:01
<transcript>: Yeah, we can move all of an into a component and dynamically import that component. That's probably the move. That's the move.

03:26:01
<transcript>: probably shouldn't

03:26:04
neochromer: @adamdotdev https://blog.bitsrc.io/using-non-ssr-friendly-components-with-next-js-916f38e8992c

03:26:04
<transcript>: Probably shouldn't just have it in the page.

03:26:04
<transcript>: yeah

03:26:06
neochromer: here is a good example

03:26:06
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. Let's do that.

03:26:09
shiftlessatol: Eagles [ Band ]

03:26:09
<transcript>: Using.

03:26:09
<transcript>: non ssr

03:26:12
neochromer: this is what i used

03:26:13
<transcript>: Non SSR friendly Components with Nick JS. Everybody's got good examples here.

03:26:18
<transcript>: That's what you used.

03:26:24
<transcript>: I know how to do the like move this into a component and then not use dynamic.

03:26:24
<transcript>: to not

03:26:28
<transcript>: To not SSR it. And that's what they're doing here, right? Yeah.

03:26:28
<transcript>: okay

03:26:30
<transcript>: Okay, we'll do that.

03:26:31
<transcript>: We'll do that.

03:26:33
axstormx: is this vim?

03:26:36
neochromer: below he makes noSSRWrapper

03:26:41
neochromer: thats a good way to approach it

03:26:42
<transcript>: Is there any downside to that? I guess. Like.

03:26:45
<transcript>: My landing page.

03:26:45
<transcript>: is going

03:26:47
<transcript>: Is going to be.

03:26:50
woycieszko: @axstormx yes xD

03:26:53
<transcript>: Is this them? Yeah, it is. Welcome to Chat. Axtorm. Ax, Storm, axtorm.

03:26:55
<transcript>: I think.

03:27:01
<transcript>: My problem is like now my hangup is I think I should do like a.

03:27:03
<transcript>: Link.

03:27:03
<transcript>: an actual

03:27:05
<transcript>: An actual landing page.

03:27:10
<transcript>: And when you click play it should go to a different route. I think the landing page should not have.

03:27:10
<transcript>: the

03:27:13
<transcript>: The state machine in it.

03:27:13
<transcript>: the

03:27:18
<transcript>: The problem with that. The problem with that? Yeah. Maybe I shouldn't have done the.

03:27:22
<transcript>: Machine like this. The way I did the machine was that it modeled.

03:27:22
<transcript>: the state before

03:27:25
<transcript>: The State before you click Play game.

03:27:35
<transcript>: But I could just take il and game over out of the state machine have the state machine just be from the moment you start playing a game.

03:27:42
<transcript>: But for now, I think I think what we can do is.

03:27:45
<transcript>: Just.

03:27:45
<transcript>: move all

03:27:48
<transcript>: Move all the machine and all that stuff into a component.

03:27:48
<transcript>: dynamically

03:27:48
axstormx: @Woycieszko NotLikeThis NotLikeThis

03:27:51
<transcript>: Dynamically import it and everything should be fine.

03:27:56
<transcript>: Okay. So let's do that. Let's say X for default home. Let's say.

03:27:58
<transcript>: Const.

03:27:58
woycieszko: xD

03:28:00
<transcript>: Game.

03:28:02
<transcript>: Own it.

03:28:11
<transcript>: I don't want to call a game for funny, but I think game already mean something. I don't know. We'll see game is a react SC.

03:28:16
<transcript>: scene

03:28:17
<transcript>: Scene.

03:28:33
<transcript>: Interface.

03:28:33
<transcript>: game

03:28:35
<transcript>: Game props.

03:28:38
<transcript>: React, no.

03:28:42
<transcript>: Just. Okay.

03:28:47
<transcript>: How's that high void? Oh, yeah, I got to return something.

03:28:49
<transcript>: So return.

03:28:56
<transcript>: Okay. I got to actually put some stuff in there.

03:28:59
<transcript>: Thanks so much.

03:29:02
<transcript>: Thanks so much for the follow.

03:29:02
<transcript>: anyone

03:29:04
<transcript>: Anyone ghost.

03:29:06
<transcript>: Anyone goes.

03:29:10
<transcript>: So let's see.

03:29:16
<transcript>: This is the right here. This return statement. Oh, I was just like.

03:29:25
<transcript>: Okay.

03:29:27
<transcript>: Just like that.

03:29:27
<transcript>: i'm gonna

03:29:30
<transcript>: I'm gonna bring all this stuff over.

03:29:32
<transcript>: Like.

03:29:32
<transcript>: what stuff

03:29:34
<transcript>: What stuff? Over.

03:29:37
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow the coder news.

03:29:41
<transcript>: Appreciate all these follows. I really do.

03:29:41
<transcript>: all

03:29:45
<transcript>: All this stuff. I guess all this code is just gonna go into.

03:29:50
<transcript>: It's gonna go into.

03:29:50
<transcript>: this

03:29:52
<transcript>: This thing.

03:29:52
<transcript>: all this

03:29:55
<transcript>: All this code. Literally all of it.

03:29:59
<transcript>: Right.

03:30:15
<transcript>: Did I do it.

03:30:18
<transcript>: Do too much.

03:30:22
<transcript>: All that code in there.

03:30:27
<transcript>: So that's a game. And now the home component is just gonna be.

03:30:32
<transcript>: Let's just do this. Let's say lead in.

03:30:35
<transcript>: That work. Yeah.

03:30:38
<transcript>: Return.

03:30:38
<transcript>: game

03:30:39
<transcript>: Game.

03:30:45
<transcript>: But we can make that dynamic now, right.

03:30:48
<transcript>: So the way we do that.

03:30:53
<transcript>: What's the easiest way to do that? Import dynamic from next dynamic.

03:30:59
<transcript>: Dynamic.

03:31:00
<transcript>: From.

03:31:04
<transcript>: Next dynamic.

03:31:18
<transcript>: So then gain I can define the component.

03:31:18
<transcript>: as

03:31:21
<transcript>: As Dynamic, right? Yeah.

03:31:21
<transcript>: where can i do

03:31:23
<transcript>: Where can I do that? Right here.

03:31:28
<transcript>: No. That's if it's in a separate file. Can I just do it all in a line in the same file here.

03:31:37
<transcript>: Oh.

03:31:37
<transcript>: this is

03:31:44
<transcript>: This is what you said earlier. And I was I was not paying attention. I could just create a rapper like this.

03:31:48
<transcript>: Default dynamic.

03:31:48
<transcript>: prom

03:31:52
kauai_life: nice stache

03:31:52
<transcript>: Promise. Resolve non SSR wrapper. I could have just done that.

03:31:57
<transcript>: And then enclose any page and that component to disable SSR.

03:32:00
<transcript>: That would have been easier.

03:32:10
<transcript>: Nice. Thanks. Thanks for that. Yeah. This is nicer. I like this. This is a nice way to solve this.

03:32:27
<transcript>: I guess I the problem with the Pages directory is I can't colocate. So now it's gonna be my first component file. So I make a component directory.

03:32:28
dedadev: what is the state management library that you are using?

03:32:29
<transcript>: Yes.

03:32:34
<transcript>: Components Directory Oh, Wait, wait, no.

03:32:38
<transcript>: No, I don't I could delight I could define this in line.

03:32:40
<transcript>: Okay.

03:32:40
<transcript>: i'm

03:32:47
<transcript>: I'm gonna keep it in the game component like this. I think that's nice for when I move this out of this file. It's not gonna be in this page.

03:32:47
<transcript>: so

03:32:48
woycieszko: i love your config xD and you share ??

03:32:52
<transcript>: So home a return game. But we're gonna have this component right here.

03:32:56
<transcript>: Like so.

03:32:59
<transcript>: I'm SSR wrapper.

03:33:09
<transcript>: Okay.

03:33:13
<transcript>: Like that dynamic.

03:33:17
<transcript>: Promise resolved not as our SSR false.

03:33:20
woycieszko: sorry my bad can you share with vim config ?

03:33:21
<transcript>: Then I can just wrap stuff in that, right.

03:33:30
<transcript>: And then we're gonna say, it's a.

03:33:33
<transcript>: React FC.

03:33:37
<transcript>: But I don't care if it has any props.

03:33:42
<transcript>: Of children or something.

03:33:45
<transcript>: React props with children.

03:33:51
<transcript>: Let's just see like this children.

03:33:59
<transcript>: Wrapper. And then we can just say, here.

03:34:04
<transcript>: We're gonna say Non SSR wrapper.

03:34:13
<transcript>: Is it gonna work? What do we think? If they think it's gonna work? I think it's gonna work.

03:34:13
<transcript>: kind

03:34:16
ohmymndy: 3 Queen songs after each other Good stuff

03:34:18
<transcript>: Kind of a mess. This file has just gotten huge, but, like, I don't know, it's a game.

03:34:21
<transcript>: It's a game. There's only one file.

03:34:26
dedadev: 69% chance that is going to work

03:34:31
<transcript>: What is the state management library that you're using.

03:34:31
<transcript>: x stake

03:34:32
<transcript>: X stake.

03:34:32
<transcript>: i'm using

03:34:34
<transcript>: I'm using X state.

03:34:34
<transcript>: makes

03:34:36
<transcript>: Makes a state machine.

03:34:36
<transcript>: the whole

03:34:41
<transcript>: The whole game kind of exists in the same machine. Hydration failed. What did I do wrong here.

03:34:47
<transcript>: What did I do? Wrong game. Non SSR wrapper.

03:34:50
<transcript>: Does dynamic.

03:34:50
<transcript>: oh i

03:34:54
<transcript>: Oh, I wasn't. They were exporting dining. I need to like, do like this.

03:34:58
<transcript>: Non SSR.

03:34:58
<transcript>: wrap

03:35:00
<transcript>: Wrapper.

03:35:05
<transcript>: Component I don't know.

03:35:09
<transcript>: This one should be named like.

03:35:15
<transcript>: We're gonna do that.

03:35:24
dedadev: is it xstate doing something that redux or mobix cant?

03:35:25
<transcript>: And this is gonna be.

03:35:32
<transcript>: I think that's gonna work.

03:35:36
cowfacedude99: !dotfiles

03:35:36
fossabot: Adam's dotfiles live here: https://github.com/adamelmore/dotfiles The repository for bitter is here: https://github.com/adamelmore/bitter

03:35:41
<transcript>: Because if I answer some questions like that's translate.

03:35:41
<transcript>: we got score

03:35:43
<transcript>: We got score of one.

03:35:46
<transcript>: And that's help like.

03:35:50
<transcript>: Let's see what is statement. I love your config.

03:35:50
<transcript>: and you share

03:36:00
woycieszko: thanks !

03:36:02
<transcript>: And you share. Yeah, it's in my my invent configs. In my files. There's a dot file's command. Two, three Queen songs after each other. Good stuff. I agree. 69%. Chance. This is going to work.

03:36:02
<transcript>: okay let's

03:36:03
<transcript>: Okay, let's refresh the page.

03:36:03
<transcript>: and see

03:36:06
<transcript>: And see where it picks up.

03:36:08
<transcript>: So the timer's broken.

03:36:08
<transcript>: the

03:36:11
<transcript>: The score is right.

03:36:11
<transcript>: and that's

03:36:19
<transcript>: And that's Lambda. Now the timer's. Right? So the timer is a visual thing. I don't have it in the state machine right now, which is a bummer.

03:36:19
<transcript>: i should

03:36:20
<transcript>: I should.

03:36:20
<transcript>: we should

03:36:23
<transcript>: We should probably figure that out.

03:36:33
<transcript>: If it is X eight doing something that Redux or Mobbix, can't I just. I liked the idea of modeling this game as a state machine. It just seemed like a good fit.

03:36:33
<transcript>: and i do

03:36:37
<transcript>: And I do feel pretty good about it. I've enjoyed working with it.

03:36:37
<transcript>: there we go

03:36:39
<transcript>: There we go. And then we got our score.

03:36:39
<transcript>: right there

03:36:42
<transcript>: Right there. So if I refresh the page.

03:36:45
<transcript>: I'm still on this game overstate.

03:37:04
<transcript>: I don't know. How do we feel about it? Does it need to have another page? Should it? Should the landing page just launch you into the game. This will probably be like a slash play or something page, but I think this is fine. It has this giant state machine that handles all of the game flow. You can create new games.

03:37:04
<transcript>: we'll have a separate

03:37:06
<transcript>: We'll have a separate page for the Leaderboard, I guess.

03:37:09
<transcript>: But I don't know. I think it feels pretty good.

03:37:09
<transcript>: feels pretty

03:37:11
<transcript>: Feels pretty good.

03:37:15
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:37:15
<transcript>: the only thing i

03:37:21
<transcript>: The only thing I gotta figure out is the timer. I don't have it in the state machine right now. It's kind of an external thing.

03:37:21
<transcript>: so

03:37:26
<transcript>: So we could, like we could kind of like, fumble around and make that work.

03:37:26
<transcript>: by

03:37:29
<transcript>: By storing it separately in local storage.

03:37:29
<transcript>: that

03:37:31
<transcript>: That feels less than ideal.

03:37:37
<transcript>: Or maybe we just need to start the timer.

03:37:37
<transcript>: let's see

03:37:38
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:37:47
<transcript>: I don't like managing it outside of it. Let's let's try and move this inside the state machine.

03:37:52
<transcript>: Xdate creator had DMed? Me a solution.

03:37:59
<transcript>: Called a dirty timer, and I didn't. I didn't implement it because I just wasn't ready. But I think I'm ready.

03:37:59
<transcript>: think i'm ready

03:38:01
<transcript>: Think I'm ready, think I'm ready. Let's do it.

03:38:08
<transcript>: Okay. Kill that. I do like that. We got the state now. It's persisted. I can make changes to the things.

03:38:08
<transcript>: and doesn't

03:38:10
<transcript>: And doesn't completely.

03:38:10
<transcript>: start the game

03:38:12
<transcript>: Start the game over. That feels good.

03:38:17
<transcript>: Okay.

03:38:17
<transcript>: let's

03:38:20
<transcript>: Let's see. I need to.

03:38:30
<transcript>: I need to open up my DM's. I'm gonna have to go fuzzy for a SEC.

03:38:41
<transcript>: I gotta stay on top of my Twitter DNS there I'm not on top of them.

03:38:43
<transcript>: It's bad.

03:38:47
<transcript>: It's real bad. David Kay? Here we go.

03:38:47
<transcript>: open the

03:38:57
<transcript>: Open the console whenever you click the button adds five things. The timer timer is made using a dirty callback. You can do absolutely anything in there. Also found exercise to refactor that callback into state machine.

03:38:57
ohmymndy: I am going to do some groceries. See you all later! :-)

03:39:02
<transcript>: Okay. So here's an example.

03:39:04
<transcript>: That David has given me like.

03:39:06
<transcript>: Fuzzy.

03:39:10
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow Shero.

03:39:24
<transcript>: Oh, my Mandy gonna do some groceries to you later. Thanks so much, Mandy, for showing up. I missed you. And it's nice to see you again. Goodbye. Enjoy your grocery shopping. That sounds like a ton of fun. Actually, I love going to the grocery store. Okay, so here is the example he sent me.

03:39:27
<transcript>: Toggle machine. Let's see.

03:39:30
salahdinebocuif: hi

03:39:30
ohmymndy: Bye! :-)

03:39:31
<transcript>: Context counts. States inactive.

03:39:36
<transcript>: Let's see invoke so when it goes to active it invokes a timer.

03:39:40
<transcript>: And the timer has a receive.

03:39:40
<transcript>: okay

03:39:41
<transcript>: Okay.

03:39:45
<transcript>: So.

03:39:45
<transcript>: sin back

03:39:47
<transcript>: Sin back and received.

03:39:52
<transcript>: So this is a different kind of a service that I'm used to.

03:39:54
<transcript>: Time remaining.

03:39:58
<transcript>: Could come from context.

03:39:58
<transcript>: we

03:40:00
<transcript>: We set an interval.

03:40:02
<transcript>: Every second.

03:40:06
<transcript>: We remove a second from that.

03:40:10
<transcript>: If time remaining is less than or equal to zero.

03:40:22
<transcript>: Hi, Salah.

03:40:25
<transcript>: Welcome to my chat.

03:40:27
<transcript>: Welcome, welcome.

03:40:37
<transcript>: Time remaining. So what's happening here? So send back. If time remaining is less than or is equal to zero, then we could send back an event.

03:40:38
<transcript>: Okay.

03:40:41
<transcript>: And if we receive an event.

03:40:41
<transcript>: if the

03:40:44
<transcript>: If the type is answer, we add 5 seconds.

03:40:44
<transcript>: okay

03:40:54
<transcript>: Okay. So this is a way to interact with the timer, like send and receive within a timer or within a service is what this is. And then we return clear interval.

03:40:58
<transcript>: Okay. So when the service isn't running. Yeah. Okay.

03:41:09
<transcript>: I wonder though when we do the sin back here the Time's up.

03:41:09
<transcript>: oh it'll exit

03:41:16
<transcript>: Oh, it'll exit the okay, it'll exit the service, and then the clear interval will call. That makes sense. So entry.

03:41:20
<transcript>: Assign count count plus one.

03:41:23
<transcript>: What's? The count.

03:41:28
<transcript>: So whenever we enter into this service.

03:41:28
dedadev: is anyone excited about the world cup?

03:41:34
<transcript>: We increase the count on toggle.

03:41:34
<transcript>: okay so

03:41:37
<transcript>: Okay, so actions sin to timer.

03:41:37
<transcript>: type ant

03:41:39
<transcript>: Type Anter.

03:41:48
<transcript>: That's where the receive happens. Yeah. If EV type answer. Okay. So that's how that's working. You can pass a payload into that.

03:41:54
<transcript>: You can send events to services.

03:42:00
<transcript>: Time's up, we go to inactive so here we send back a Time's up.

03:42:00
<transcript>: we got

03:42:04
lastofusspoil: im confused. why is world cup happening during winter?

03:42:07
<transcript>: We got a game over. Okay. Anyone excited about the World Cup? I didn't know the World Cup was going on because I'm an American.

03:42:16
<transcript>: But it's sounds exciting. First, I'm chat. Welcome to Chat. Last of us. Spoil. I'm confused. Why is workup happening during winter.

03:42:16
<transcript>: someone answer

03:42:23
<transcript>: Someone answer that question. I'm also confused, but I didn't know it didn't happen during the winter in the first place. So not that confused.

03:42:27
<transcript>: Let's see active and times up. Okay.

03:42:27
lastofusspoil: hey, i'm learning how to code

03:42:28
neochromer: Because it happens in Qatar

03:42:29
<transcript>: Let's do this.

03:42:29
<transcript>: click

03:42:30
<transcript>: Click me.

03:42:31
wishzera: its in qatar

03:42:32
neochromer: and its impossible to do it in summer

03:42:35
neochromer: people would die

03:42:38
ropetin: Football is a winter sport anyway, at least in the UK

03:42:42
<transcript>: And it should be giving it a increased timer. I don't see anything on the timer, but let's try this pattern. Let's see if we can make this work. So the idea is that we'll have an top level.

03:42:43
bonnjaevel: I am so struggling with wanting to boycott the world cup but knowing I will watch it anyway.. >D

03:42:47
<transcript>: First thing I want to do is I want to save all these changes.

03:42:51
<transcript>: Get commit.

03:42:57
<transcript>: Feature what do We Do? Persisted game, state.

03:42:57
neochromer: @bonnjaevel a lot of people have that issue lol

03:43:00
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:43:00
<transcript>: yeah

03:43:02
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:43:04
<transcript>: Okay.

03:43:09
neochromer: but tbh won't change a thing if you boycott or not

03:43:11
<transcript>: Now I want to go up here, and I want to make some big changes. Did I push that.

03:43:14
<transcript>: Okay.

03:43:18
<transcript>: Starting so we have starts in idle.

03:43:18
<transcript>: that goes

03:43:20
<transcript>: That goes to.

03:43:31
<transcript>: On start game. It goes to starting. Once I'm starting. We invoke start.

03:43:36
<transcript>: On done. We got to active.

03:43:36
dedadev: what are the arguments for boycotting?

03:43:41
lastofusspoil: do you memorize any syntax?

03:43:41
<transcript>: Once we're in active, this is a whole separate machine.

03:43:41
<transcript>: act it was like

03:43:44
<transcript>: Act. It was like a submachine.

03:43:44
<transcript>: initial

03:43:47
<transcript>: Initial state it's guessing on expired we go to game over.

03:43:50
<transcript>: States.

03:43:50
<transcript>: guessing

03:43:52
<transcript>: Guessing.

03:43:52
ropetin: We have cricket in the summer, then *blah* football during the dark days of "not cricket season" (also known as winter)

03:43:59
<transcript>: So much for the last of us. Spoil.

03:43:59
<transcript>: do you mem

03:44:02
<transcript>: Do you memorize any syntax.

03:44:07
<transcript>: What are the arguments for boycotting? Whose boycotting? What missed? Something.

03:44:11
<transcript>: Football is a winner. Sport.

03:44:14
<transcript>: Oh, welcome to Chat Wish Zara.

03:44:20
<transcript>: Last of us is learning how to code. It happens in Qatar.

03:44:24
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat and it's possible to do it in summer.

03:44:24
<transcript>: people

03:44:33
<transcript>: People would die. Oof football is a winner sport anyway, at least in the UK. So struggling with wanting to boycott the World Cup, but knowing I will watch it anyway.

03:44:38
<transcript>: Okay, do I memorize any syntax.

03:44:48
<transcript>: Not really. I think you just, like, start to some of it starts to kind of become embedded, but you don't intentionally memorize it. You just kind of figure out what you have to figure out.

03:44:54
bonnjaevel: There is a new Netflix documentary about how corrupt FIFA is for those uninitiated

03:44:56
<transcript>: So we assign on entry into guessing, we assign choice and results undefined we send.

03:45:02
<transcript>: Expired. And we do that on a delay. So this is how I was doing.

03:45:08
<transcript>: Delay expires. And there's a timer, which is the service. Now. It's a delay timer.

03:45:14
<transcript>: Delay expires amount.

03:45:14
<transcript>: id is

03:45:17
<transcript>: Id is timer. I don't know if I understand that.

03:45:20
<transcript>: I don't understand it right now.

03:45:23
mattmancodes: The arguments for boycotting - Qatars human rights record, the corruption that got them the World Cup in the first place, Slave labour to build the stadiums...

03:45:26
<transcript>: Oh, we're sending.

03:45:26
<transcript>: the exp

03:45:28
<transcript>: The expired event.

03:45:41
<transcript>: After delay, which is a dynamic delay called expires. And we name an ID for that that we can cancel. So once you guess we cancel that event that's not going to go out. Now.

03:45:41
<transcript>: so

03:45:47
<transcript>: So on guess we go into checking answer we have sign the choice to the context.

03:45:53
<transcript>: Sign choice. Yeah. And then we cancel that timer.

03:45:53
<transcript>: check

03:45:58
<transcript>: Checking the answer is a service called answer that we invoke.

03:45:58
<transcript>: target

03:46:00
<transcript>: Target showing answer.

03:46:05
<transcript>: Actions. We assign the event.

03:46:05
<transcript>: okay

03:46:06
<transcript>: Okay.

03:46:06
<transcript>: so the event

03:46:09
<transcript>: So the event has data on it.

03:46:09
<transcript>: after we

03:46:12
<transcript>: After we run the answer service, okay. Makes sense.

03:46:12
<transcript>: just trying

03:46:15
<transcript>: Just trying to piece all this back together in my brain.

03:46:24
<transcript>: It's about time for me to get off here for the day.

03:46:26
<transcript>: Showing answer.

03:46:41
<transcript>: On done. So we run the next and I'm done. We go to guessing. We assign the round from the event data. Okay, now, how would I change this? So that I don't need this timer. Here. This timer.

03:46:43
<transcript>: Let's just go ahead and delete.

03:46:52
<transcript>: Let's delete those. I don't need them. Start. Restarting. Seconds.

03:47:02
<transcript>: So that I think that timer is still going to be needed regardless of how we do the state machine.

03:47:02
<transcript>: because

03:47:05
<transcript>: Because we it's just a visual thing, right.

03:47:08
<transcript>: Is there a way to make.

03:47:14
<transcript>: Our app better with this pattern that Davidson us. I'm not actually sure.

03:47:16
<transcript>: I'm not positive anymore.

03:47:18
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:47:24
<transcript>: Time remaining I guess if I were if I were tracking time remaining.

03:47:24
<transcript>: in

03:47:26
<transcript>: In context.

03:47:29
<transcript>: Then.

03:47:35
<transcript>: That would make sense.

03:47:47
<transcript>: Like, do I want to put this time or somehow in my context so seconds could be a separate.

03:47:52
<transcript>: Thing in the context. And then I could do all the timing.

03:47:54
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:47:54
<transcript>: would that be better

03:47:59
<transcript>: Would that be better so I don't have the external thing in all the state is just stored.

03:48:02
<transcript>: Maybe.

03:48:02
<transcript>: maybe

03:48:10
<transcript>: Maybe. Why do I have to have a timer though? Why can't I just calculate seconds based on the context expiry.

03:48:10
<transcript>: yeah wait wait

03:48:11
<transcript>: Yeah, wait, wait.

03:48:11
<transcript>: why can't

03:48:13
<transcript>: Why can't I just do this.

03:48:13
<transcript>: hang on

03:48:14
<transcript>: Hang on.

03:48:14
<transcript>: here

03:48:15
<transcript>: Here.

03:48:20
dedadev: @mattmancodes and Russia was better?

03:48:21
<transcript>: Humor me.

03:48:21
<transcript>: here

03:48:24
<transcript>: Here. So second, why couldn't this just be calculated.

03:48:30
<transcript>: It's on the expire time in the condo. It could dumb right.

03:48:33
<transcript>: Think it could.

03:48:35
<transcript>: So.

03:48:35
<transcript>: context

03:48:37
<transcript>: Context.

03:48:38
hellorealdk: hello

03:48:43
<transcript>: Expires.

03:48:48
<transcript>: That a thing is that a value.

03:48:50
<transcript>: What does a round hat have.

03:48:50
<transcript>: answer

03:48:53
<transcript>: Answer choices in no.

03:48:58
<transcript>: Oh, game expires. It's games, game.

03:48:58
okufa_f: do you ever feel annoyed that your tailwind stuff runs off the page

03:49:00
<transcript>: Expires.

03:49:04
mattmancodes: @mattmancodes No. They shouldn't have got the World Cup either, and there were calls to boycot that one too

03:49:06
<transcript>: Date or defined. So this is going to be expires minus.

03:49:13
<transcript>: This will only work if it renders every time.

03:49:20
<transcript>: This won't rerender. This is the problem.

03:49:25
<transcript>: It's like I just need to rerender the thing every second.

03:49:27
kaloome: !awguess

03:49:28
fossabot: awguess is a guessing game where you're given an AWS service icon and you have to choose the correct service! https://github.com/adamelmore/awguess

03:49:29
<transcript>: Could I do that? Could I rerender.

03:49:33
<transcript>: How would I want to do that.

03:49:33
<transcript>: just

03:49:37
lastofusspoil: are you a freelancer?

03:49:38
<transcript>: Just a little clock. Can I just rerender it every second to recalculate this.

03:49:40
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:49:48
<transcript>: You guys are talking about the World Cup. Do you ever feel annoyed that your tail and stuff runs off the page and not really.

03:49:48
<transcript>: it

03:49:50
<transcript>: It doesn't bother me too bad.

03:49:55
<transcript>: I get that some people don't like that. There's ways to solve it.

03:49:59
<transcript>: I just don't really care.

03:50:02
<transcript>: Hello.

03:50:02
<transcript>: hello

03:50:03
<transcript>: Hello.

03:50:03
<transcript>: real

03:50:05
<transcript>: Real DK.

03:50:13
<transcript>: Welcome to chat.

03:50:17
<transcript>: Are you a freelancer? No. Actually, I went back to my.

03:50:17
<transcript>: start

03:50:26
<transcript>: Startup statmeus so I Copen sat me is like eight years ago and I rejoined it after a three year hiatus.

03:50:31
<transcript>: I've rejoined. So let's see. Let's do the calculation. So expires would be that.

03:50:31
<transcript>: minus

03:50:33
<transcript>: Minus.

03:50:37
neochromer: ooh congratz on the rejoining

03:50:39
<transcript>: Eight, nine. Now maybe.

03:50:42
neochromer: is that the fantasy basketball thingy?

03:50:44
okufa_f: at what point did you feel statmuse was going to be big, or were you already confident that statmuse had potential

03:50:45
<transcript>: Or new date. I guess it wouldn't be a.

03:50:47
<transcript>: Minus.

03:50:49
<transcript>: What did I do.

03:50:49
<transcript>: what did i do

03:50:50
<transcript>: What did I do.

03:50:53
<transcript>: Did I mess up my buffer.

03:50:57
<transcript>: Okay. Here we go.

03:51:04
<transcript>: Expires minus new date.

03:51:07
<transcript>: Can't do that, can you? You have to like.

03:51:07
<transcript>: convert it

03:51:09
<transcript>: Convert it to.

03:51:09
<transcript>: so this

03:51:12
<transcript>: So this would be minus eight. Now.

03:51:14
<transcript>: And then.

03:51:18
<transcript>: This would be.

03:51:18
<transcript>: dot

03:51:19
<transcript>: Dot.

03:51:22
<transcript>: To what.

03:51:22
<transcript>: how do i

03:51:25
<transcript>: How do I get the number out of it.

03:51:32
<transcript>: No. How do I get the number? How do you do date, math.

03:51:32
<transcript>: i forget

03:51:34
<transcript>: I forget every time JavaScript.

03:51:36
<transcript>: Date math.

03:51:43
<transcript>: Date matemath. Neocromer Congrats on the rejoining it's at the fantasy basketball thing. Yeah, it's.

03:51:43
<transcript>: like search

03:51:46
<transcript>: Like search engine for sports and financial data.

03:51:52
<transcript>: Math with dates and JavaScript. So I'm gonna get the difference. Javascript.

03:51:56
<transcript>: Get different between two dates.

03:51:59
<transcript>: Seconds. Ideal.

03:51:59
<transcript>: here

03:52:01
<transcript>: Here's, One way.

03:52:05
<transcript>: Math absolute date. Two minus eight. One.

03:52:05
<transcript>: is the

03:52:07
<transcript>: Is the difference in time.

03:52:12
<transcript>: This didn't work for me. I couldn't.

03:52:14
<transcript>: Do that.

03:52:19
<transcript>: Right? This didn't work.

03:52:19
<transcript>: left hand

03:52:30
<transcript>: Left hand side. What's it say that's inside MSU to type any number beginner I'm object is possibly undefined. Is that the problem? It just can't be if it's undefined, that would throw a wrench in this whole thing.

03:52:36
<transcript>: We're just gonna say this text.

03:52:40
<transcript>: Is only going to actually I can do you one better.

03:52:43
<transcript>: We're gonna say.

03:52:43
okufa_f: date1.getTime() - date2.getTime()

03:52:50
<transcript>: This text is only going to render if context game expires.

03:52:54
iworkatmcdonaids: can do .valueOf() to get milliseconds of expires then do .valueOf() - Date.now()

03:52:59
<transcript>: Does that fix it? No still can't let's hand must see a number or big Int so why can't you do this.

03:53:11
<transcript>: Why can't I do that.

03:53:13
spotmonk: as number?

03:53:13
dedadev: (context.game_.expires as Date)

03:53:17
<transcript>: Who's a JavaScript expert. Oh, get time. Thank you, thank you.

03:53:26
<transcript>: Thank you. Thank you. Let's see. At what point did you feel Statmes is going to be big? Or were you already confident that that means had potential.

03:53:26
<transcript>: well

03:53:35
<transcript>: Well, it's a funny story, Kufa, I've just got a couple minutes here, let me tell you that story when I come back to my teleprompter here in a second, I'm almost done with the code part of today.

03:53:38
<transcript>: Value of to get milliseconds.

03:53:38
<transcript>: yeah

03:53:40
<transcript>: Yeah we're gonna do.

03:53:40
<transcript>: we're gonna

03:53:47
<transcript>: We're gonna do welcome to Chat Spot Monk. We're gonna do Get time I think this is what I typically do? I just forgot.

03:53:50
<transcript>: And then this can be.

03:53:53
<transcript>: Date dot now.

03:53:53
<transcript>: okay so

03:53:56
<transcript>: Okay. So that's gonna be in milliseconds.

03:53:56
okufa_f: getTime returns in ms btw

03:53:58
<transcript>: And let's just see what that looks like.

03:54:04
<transcript>: In seconds. And I know that.

03:54:04
<transcript>: where

03:54:08
<transcript>: Where but I want to see if I can like make changes now.

03:54:14
<transcript>: Yeah, those are milliseconds and they're not updated, which is important.

03:54:14
<transcript>: so let's

03:54:16
<transcript>: So let's just do this. Let's do.

03:54:22
toox_96: Hi did you try nuxt 3 if yes what is the differences with next 13 ???

03:54:25
<transcript>: Ys in brackets, we're gonna wrap that in a print, and we're gonna say.

03:54:28
<transcript>: The paren's divided by.

03:54:31
<transcript>: Exceed no. 1000.

03:54:33
<transcript>: What.

03:54:37
<transcript>: Oh, what? Your time is not a function.

03:54:37
<transcript>: but i thought

03:54:41
<transcript>: But I thought I said, if it is an if it's a thing.

03:54:44
<transcript>: I said if it's a sting thing.

03:54:44
<transcript>: what's the problem

03:54:45
<transcript>: What's the problem.

03:54:48
<transcript>: What's the problem here.

03:54:48
<transcript>: if it's not

03:54:56
<transcript>: If it's not a thing, it shouldn't be getting in here. Right? Context. Game. Expires. Gittleme. What would expires B? If not.

03:55:00
<transcript>: What am I missing.

03:55:00
<transcript>: get time

03:55:02
<transcript>: Get time returns milliseconds millisecond Yeah.

03:55:02
<transcript>: welcome to chat

03:55:04
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Tukes.

03:55:04
<transcript>: hi did

03:55:08
<transcript>: Hi. Did you try Nuts three if yes. What is the difference with next 13.

03:55:08
<transcript>: i've never

03:55:11
<transcript>: I've never tried next in my life I've never used.

03:55:11
<transcript>: next

03:55:12
<transcript>: Next.

03:55:12
<transcript>: i know

03:55:19
<transcript>: I know nothing of next. I don't use any of it's related. Is that a view thing? I think.

03:55:23
<transcript>: What's the problem here.

03:55:23
<transcript>: fire

03:55:25
<transcript>: Fires get time.

03:55:25
<transcript>: not a function

03:55:27
<transcript>: Not a function.

03:55:30
<transcript>: Did I did I screw something up here.

03:55:34
mattmancodes: deez nuxt

03:55:36
<transcript>: Get time returns in milliseconds yeah expires can be a date.

03:55:36
<transcript>: always

03:55:36
kaloome: @toox_96 react vs vue + next has more advanced features (like RSC)

03:55:39
<transcript>: Always a date. Here. What's the problem? What happens.

03:55:41
dedadev: what is the type of expires?

03:55:48
<transcript>: I don't know what happened. I broke something. Let's clear all the data.

03:55:48
aatishsai: can you log what expires is

03:55:54
<transcript>: Let's clear it.

03:55:54
<transcript>: log would

03:56:01
kaloome: are this website in production already ?

03:56:04
lastofusspoil: is backend, frontend, or fullstack work?

03:56:10
<transcript>: Log would expires. Yeah, we can do that. So there it's working. Now. I don't know what happened. If it was a state thing, that I stored something. I don't know. It shouldn't. Only it should only create this Div if that exists. So now the problem is, see, that's not counting down. It's also not rounded. We should round it.

03:56:11
kaloome: is the*

03:56:12
<transcript>: We should say.

03:56:14
<transcript>: Why as.

03:56:24
<transcript>: We should say here, we want to do one.

03:56:24
<transcript>: s

03:56:28
<transcript>: Si like that we want to do.

03:56:33
<transcript>: Prinz.

03:56:33
<transcript>: i'm gonna say

03:56:35
<transcript>: I'm gonna say Math, round.

03:56:37
lastofusspoil: is this*

03:56:41
<transcript>: Like How's that what's what's happening.

03:56:41
<transcript>: get

03:56:43
<transcript>: Get time is not a function.

03:56:46
<transcript>: Is this website in production already.

03:56:46
<transcript>: kind of

03:56:48
<transcript>: Kind of.

03:56:48
<transcript>: kind of

03:56:49
okufa_f: this is frontend right now

03:56:52
<transcript>: Kind of. Maybe not. I think I have a DNS issue still.

03:56:55
<transcript>: This is front end right now.

03:56:56
lastofusspoil: nice

03:56:58
okufa_f: but next js also acts like a server

03:56:59
<transcript>: It's it's full stack work. We're using the T three stack.

03:57:04
<transcript>: What is the type of expires? Let's log it.

03:57:07
<transcript>: Let's log expires.

03:57:10
<transcript>: We'll just do it up here.

03:57:14
<transcript>: Console, log.

03:57:18
<transcript>: Context GAM.

03:57:18
<transcript>: expiring

03:57:19
<transcript>: Expiring.

03:57:27
<transcript>: Is it locked.

03:57:33
<transcript>: Did I do the right thing? Contacts Game Expires. Yeah.

03:57:33
<transcript>: it's logging

03:57:37
<transcript>: It's logging. It's is it a string. Once you type of.

03:57:38
lastofusspoil: i hope i could this natural when i'm done my courses

03:57:42
<transcript>: Really got to fix this. Okay.

03:57:47
lastofusspoil: code* sorry typo

03:57:50
<transcript>: See? What is it? What is it? String? Why is it a string.

03:57:50
<transcript>: that doesn't

03:57:52
<transcript>: That doesn't make any sense.

03:57:54
<transcript>: And look.

03:57:55
cr4xr3v: hey, ; or not?

03:58:02
dedadev: if its a string than you need new Date(expires)

03:58:02
<transcript>: When we bring the state back, that's what the issues when we bring the state back from local storage.

03:58:06
<transcript>: Dates are no longer dates.

03:58:08
<transcript>: Which makes sense.

03:58:13
<transcript>: You need new date expires. Yeah, but the question is.

03:58:15
<transcript>: The question is.

03:58:19
<transcript>: Is that gonna affect other things.

03:58:19
<transcript>: are there things

03:58:21
<transcript>: Are there things gonna be broken because of this.

03:58:31
<transcript>: So get time let's see here. We could just say new date.

03:58:31
<transcript>: you pass

03:58:36
<transcript>: You pass a date into a date and not break it. Like if this is a date.

03:58:36
<transcript>: oh no

03:58:38
<transcript>: Oh, no. I wanted to do this.

03:58:44
<transcript>: I pass a date into a date that destroying.

03:58:46
<transcript>: Runtime.

03:58:50
<transcript>: Why is it all format? It's a wonky.

03:58:53
<transcript>: What about? Okay, I'll see.

03:59:00
<transcript>: -134 this game expired a while ago.

03:59:00
<transcript>: so

03:59:03
<transcript>: So it should take it to game over, but it's not.

03:59:04
dedadev: apparently you can

03:59:05
okufa_f: new Date(new Date()) works on node

03:59:08
<transcript>: So why is it not? Why is it not taking it to game over.

03:59:15
<transcript>: This is a problem.

03:59:22
<transcript>: With our persisting our state thing. It's okay. We're gonna start over.

03:59:22
<transcript>: we'll

03:59:23
okufa_f: new Date(new Date( new Date()))

03:59:24
<transcript>: We'll solve that later.

03:59:27
<transcript>: So now it says 45.

03:59:27
<transcript>: it

03:59:29
<transcript>: It doesn't update because.

03:59:32
<transcript>: It doesn't have to because nothing changes.

03:59:32
<transcript>: we're going off

03:59:37
<transcript>: We're going off of this expires. We need to somehow arbitrarily.

03:59:37
<transcript>: like make

03:59:39
<transcript>: Like make this thing.

03:59:51
<transcript>: Render every second. How would you do that? How would someone do that? And then we're done for the day. Someone tell me, how would you do that if you want to just make a small component like this component. Just this Div.

03:59:51
<transcript>: here

03:59:53
<transcript>: Here. Just this Div.

03:59:55
shiftlessatol: animationframe

03:59:55
<transcript>: I just want this thing.

03:59:57
dedadev: wrap that in component, use setInterval

04:00:04
<transcript>: This right here. I just want to rerun the every second even though nothing's gonna change.

04:00:06
<transcript>: Otherwise in the state.

04:00:08
<transcript>: Now I need to make it a component.

04:00:14
<transcript>: Wrap that in component. You set interval. Good call. Yep. This needs to be a component.

04:00:17
<transcript>: Okay. So we got to put this.

04:00:17
<transcript>: let's just

04:00:19
<transcript>: Let's just do.

04:00:24
<transcript>: Like that. Nope. Yep. Like that. Let's go down here.

04:00:29
<transcript>: We'll create it right here.

04:00:33
<transcript>: Interface, timer, props.

04:00:36
<transcript>: Timer broth.

04:00:36
<transcript>: and

04:00:39
<transcript>: And then comps timer.

04:00:39
<transcript>: is a

04:00:42
<transcript>: Is a react. Sc.

04:00:42
<transcript>: timer pro

04:00:43
<transcript>: Timer, props.

04:00:47
<transcript>: And.

04:00:56
<transcript>: Something like this.

04:00:56
<transcript>: and

04:00:59
<transcript>: And we got to pass in the.

04:00:59
<transcript>: exp

04:01:01
<transcript>: Expires.

04:01:07
<transcript>: The date.

04:01:10
<transcript>: Or a string.

04:01:10
<transcript>: or unfind

04:01:11
<transcript>: Or unfind.

04:01:14
<transcript>: We'll just make it optional.

04:01:19
<transcript>: No, there's a difference we're gonna say it's UNFI. It could be undefined.

04:01:23
<transcript>: Expires.

04:01:26
<transcript>: So that we're gonna go.

04:01:27
shiftlessatol: requestAnimationFrame(yourFunction);

04:01:34
<transcript>: With that? It could be yeah, it could be on the fine? So we gotta say.

04:01:42
<transcript>: Do we want to hear that and if it's null here or do we want to handle it outside.

04:01:42
<transcript>: we'll handle it here

04:01:44
<transcript>: We'll handle it here.

04:01:49
<transcript>: If not expires. Return.

04:01:53
<transcript>: No. Can you do that now? Component no.

04:01:59
<transcript>: Okay. And then we're gonna do like this. We're gonna say.

04:01:59
<transcript>: cops

04:02:00
<transcript>: Cops.

04:02:00
<transcript>: i know we're gonna

04:02:02
<transcript>: I know we're gonna say use.

04:02:02
<transcript>: effect

04:02:04
<transcript>: Effect.

04:02:09
<transcript>: And we're gonna do.

04:02:13
<transcript>: Set intervals.

04:02:16
<transcript>: Like this.

04:02:18
<transcript>: We're gonna say.

04:02:22
<transcript>: Set? Sets something.

04:02:22
<transcript>: setclock

04:02:24
<transcript>: Setclock.

04:02:28
<transcript>: What do I want to do here.

04:02:28
<transcript>: what i wanted to do

04:02:30
<transcript>: What I wanted to do was.

04:02:33
ogflav1o: interval?

04:02:35
<transcript>: Turn clear. Interval.

04:02:41
<transcript>: I just need to force a rerender here.

04:02:44
<transcript>: React that use effect.

04:02:48
<transcript>: So we just need to have, like, a state, like.

04:02:51
<transcript>: Dummy.

04:02:52
<transcript>: Set dummy.

04:02:55
<transcript>: Sequel.

04:03:03
<transcript>: You react, use state.

04:03:06
<transcript>: False. And we'll just like, do this.

04:03:10
<transcript>: Just dumb. I mean. Yeah, but like just okay.

04:03:12
<transcript>: That dummy.

04:03:15
<transcript>: Set dummy.

04:03:15
<transcript>: dummy

04:03:16
<transcript>: Dummy.

04:03:19
<transcript>: So just toggle it repeatedly.

04:03:24
<transcript>: Super dumb? Or does this work.

04:03:25
dedadev: setDummy(Math.random())

04:03:27
<transcript>: We need to do it on an interval.

04:03:29
<transcript>: Well.

04:03:34
dedadev: that is fine too

04:03:35
<transcript>: Seconds. I don't want to do it every second, because then it could miss a tick.

04:03:35
<transcript>: we'll

04:03:38
<transcript>: We'll do it every or we can do every half second. I don't know.

04:03:38
<transcript>: but fast

04:03:45
<transcript>: But fast enough resolution. Okay, so timer is talking. That dummy flag.

04:03:45
<transcript>: and

04:03:48
<transcript>: And then that should update it. Right.

04:03:48
shiftlessatol: requestAnimationFrame(setDummy(!dummy))

04:03:52
<transcript>: Up here, we're gonna have.

04:03:58
<transcript>: Timer and expires is going to be context game.

04:03:58
<transcript>: expire

04:04:00
<transcript>: Expires.

04:04:07
<transcript>: Can't do it like that.

04:04:09
<transcript>: Where did it go.

04:04:12
<transcript>: So delete.

04:04:17
<transcript>: Okay, let's see. We'll see if it works.

04:04:19
<transcript>: What did I just do.

04:04:21
<transcript>: Yeah, that's fine.

04:04:23
cowfacedude99: it works but I think the react devs might cause havoc with that LUL

04:04:34
<transcript>: I rebuild it. Okay? I missed so many.

04:04:42
<transcript>: Messages probably New date animation frame wrap the component oh animation frame I should use request animation frame should I.

04:04:42
<transcript>: inter

04:04:44
<transcript>: Interval.

04:04:44
<transcript>: set

04:04:48
<transcript>: Set dummy math random. I should I should use animation frame. Shouldn't I.

04:04:52
<transcript>: It worked, but I think to react as might cause havoc with that.

04:04:58
<transcript>: Is there an error here.

04:05:03
<transcript>: We got to figure out how to handle when it's in a yeah? Here we go. Some new state, new game.

04:05:06
<transcript>: Is not working.

04:05:11
<transcript>: It's not working, is it because the dummy wasn't used.

04:05:11
<transcript>: in actually

04:05:14
<transcript>: In actually rendering so because nothing changed.

04:05:16
<transcript>: Is that what it is.

04:05:16
<transcript>: should we just do

04:05:19
<transcript>: Should we just do request animation frame.

04:05:21
<transcript>: React.

04:05:21
<transcript>: arbitra

04:05:23
<transcript>: Arbitrarily.

04:05:23
oskrm: cht.sh/js/requestAnimationFrame

04:05:26
<transcript>: Rerender component.

04:05:26
<transcript>: on inter

04:05:26
shiftlessatol: yes

04:05:27
<transcript>: On interval.

04:05:33
dedadev: expires is the same

04:05:35
<transcript>: Interval not causing rerender and react component.

04:05:46
<transcript>: With several. Yeah. Here we go.

04:05:48
<transcript>: Use state.

04:05:52
<transcript>: There's.

04:05:55
dedadev: you are re-rendering a component with the same "expires" value

04:05:58
<transcript>: That value for it to rerender. Probably. Yeah.

04:06:02
lastofusspoil: did you learn to code in college or self taught

04:06:03
<transcript>: Rerendering a component with the same expires? Yeah, yeah expires is not changing.

04:06:06
<transcript>: So we could calculate.

04:06:06
<transcript>: but

04:06:09
<transcript>: But should we just use animation frame.

04:06:14
<transcript>: I mean, it's not really an animation. It's just talking every second.

04:06:18
<transcript>: So it's not like changing every frame that might be.

04:06:21
<transcript>: I don't know.

04:06:21
<transcript>: inefficient

04:06:22
<transcript>: Inefficient.

04:06:22
<transcript>: let's go back

04:06:24
<transcript>: Let's go back to timer.

04:06:24
<transcript>: let's see

04:06:25
<transcript>: Let's see.

04:06:28
shiftlessatol: it's not an animation thing

04:06:37
shiftlessatol: it's a built-in feature that is constantly running

04:06:39
<transcript>: So we need to actually, like, store the calculated seconds value in here. This is no different than what I had. Is it? Yeah, it's different because the whole component's not rerendering.

04:06:41
<transcript>: The second.

04:06:47
<transcript>: Here. This is going to be.

04:06:51
<transcript>: This calculation, right.

04:07:03
shelstronic: love the music!!

04:07:04
<transcript>: I.

04:07:12
<transcript>: 'm Thinking Here the initial seconds value.

04:07:15
<transcript>: There is no.

04:07:15
shiftlessatol: you want requestAnimationFrame to keep from spinning up memory objects on separate threads that are tick based

04:07:18
<transcript>: Come on.

04:07:21
<transcript>: Irish.

04:07:21
<transcript>: else

04:07:23
<transcript>: Else.

04:07:25
<transcript>: Zero.

04:07:27
<transcript>: I don't think it matters.

04:07:34
<transcript>: Seconds is declared. Okay, so here on the interval we're gonna actually set, we're gonna recalculate right.

04:07:38
<transcript>: Calculate.

04:07:38
<transcript>: second

04:07:40
<transcript>: Second.

04:07:59
<transcript>: So here.

04:07:59
<transcript>: it's

04:08:02
<transcript>: It's gonna be set, seconds.

04:08:08
<transcript>: Down here, it's just gonna be.

04:08:11
<transcript>: Second.

04:08:15
<transcript>: I can remove this now. Right.

04:08:15
<transcript>: it's not exp

04:08:17
<transcript>: It's not expires.

04:08:17
<transcript>: now i guess we should

04:08:21
<transcript>: Now I guess we should return nothing if there's no expires. I don't know.

04:08:21
<transcript>: how to max

04:08:22
<transcript>: How to Max.

04:08:22
<transcript>: okay let's try

04:08:26
<transcript>: Okay, let's try that. And I really do need to get off your sin.

04:08:31
<transcript>: Love the music. Welcome to Chat. She'll strongek. I love your name.

04:08:34
shiftlessatol: requestAnimationFrame(setSeconds(calculateSeconds));

04:08:48
<transcript>: Did you learn to code in College or self taught? I did, like three semesters of College and then I self taught from there. I think for the Follow Racks, Racks, Racks, it's not animation thing. It's a builtin feature that is constantly running. Yeah, I'm saying, Dave, I'm saying it like it will only update every second. So do I really know.

04:08:52
<transcript>: Every frame running that code.

04:08:52
<transcript>: you want requesting

04:08:57
<transcript>: You want requesting for it to keep from spinning up memory objects on separate threads that are kickbase.

04:08:57
shiftlessatol: yes

04:08:59
<transcript>: Let's take into Koj.

04:09:05
<transcript>: You're saying I do I do really want to do that. Every frame.

04:09:08
<transcript>: So this works now.

04:09:11
<transcript>: Every 250 milliseconds.

04:09:16
<transcript>: Let's see.

04:09:20
<transcript>: You're saying, Dave, it'd be better to run this function.

04:09:20
<transcript>: thirty times

04:09:24
<transcript>: 30 times a second or whatever, then to run it every 250 milliseconds.

04:09:24
<transcript>: how's that better

04:09:26
<transcript>: How's that better.

04:09:32
<transcript>: I honestly don't know. You might have a good answer, and I just don't know.

04:09:33
shiftlessatol: it's exactly right

04:09:36
shiftlessatol: and no extra memory

04:09:37
<transcript>: It's exactly right.

04:09:41
<transcript>: And no extra memory.

04:09:46
shiftlessatol: the app has to process the interval

04:09:46
<transcript>: Request animation frame.

04:09:49
<transcript>: framework

04:09:50
<transcript>: Framework.

04:09:50
<transcript>: happens to process

04:09:52
<transcript>: Happens to process the interval.

04:09:57
<transcript>: Request animation, frame, react.

04:09:57
shiftlessatol: rAF is a native function

04:09:59
<transcript>: Timer.

04:10:04
<transcript>: Favor of all Spot Monk.

04:10:07
<transcript>: Request I'm using a native function.

04:10:17
<transcript>: Pass an empty array is the second parameter. To use it. Activoid it running one once.

04:10:21
lastofusspoil: alot of people learning to code love saying its hard. i refuse to admit that while i'm learning to code. is this a good mentality to have?

04:10:43
<transcript>: I need to understand it better. I'm using it for actual animations. In my overlays. I'm familiar vaguely with what it does.

04:10:53
<transcript>: But I would think the use case for it is the more like you have a continuous animation where every frame you're really do need to recalculate things in my case.

04:10:53
<transcript>: it's

04:10:55
shiftlessatol: its perfect for running timers

04:10:57
oskrm: @lastofusspoil Learning a new thing is hard.

04:11:01
shiftlessatol: only the timer

04:11:07
<transcript>: It's only ever calculating once a second. I mean, there's really only changing once every second. It feels like that's not really an animation. And that's why I feel bad using an API that's really centered on making animations efficient. Does that make sense.

04:11:07
<transcript>: it's perfect for

04:11:09
<transcript>: It's perfect for running timers.

04:11:09
<transcript>: a lot of people

04:11:15
<transcript>: A lot of people learning to code love saying it's hard. Or if you submit that while I'm learning the code, is this a good male mentality to have.

04:11:20
<transcript>: You submit that while I'm learning code.

04:11:20
<transcript>: that

04:11:27
<transcript>: That it's hard. I mean, hard is kind of like a very vague word. Right. Thank you for the follow. Recon. And Ahmed.

04:11:27
<transcript>: and happy

04:11:34
<transcript>: And Happy Lido clock. You know what's not hard is doing things you enjoy. And if you enjoy learning the program, it won't be hard at all.

04:11:34
<transcript>: if you're not

04:11:36
<transcript>: If you're not enjoying it.

04:11:36
<transcript>: then yeah

04:11:37
<transcript>: Then. Yeah, it'd be hard. Just like I.

04:11:41
shiftlessatol: it makes sense. however, this game is about playing as long as you can

04:11:45
<transcript>: Learn anything. You don't learn to really learn, right? I think that's the key is just finding joy. And if you really enjoy it.

04:11:45
<transcript>: then

04:11:47
<transcript>: Then you're gonna have a good time.

04:11:47
<transcript>: kinesis

04:11:48
<transcript>: Kinesis.

04:11:55
<transcript>: App stream did the timer go up by 5 seconds when I did that.

04:11:59
<transcript>: It did not so it's not getting the new expires value.

04:12:02
<transcript>: Why.

04:12:02
<transcript>: this

04:12:02
shiftlessatol: and having to maintain a tick based timer to keep track of the timer is redundant and causes issues

04:12:04
<transcript>: This is why I have the timer, I guess.

04:12:11
<transcript>: Context game expires that should be getting a new when the context changes that should get a new value.

04:12:14
<transcript>: Context changes. Right.

04:12:21
shiftlessatol: you don't want a timer to track a timer

04:12:23
<transcript>: Those context not change? Is it not rendering when contact changes.

04:12:26
<transcript>: Log, context.

04:12:28
<transcript>: Oh.

04:12:28
<transcript>: because

04:12:34
lastofusspoil: im enjoying it very much so far. but im only 10% into my web development course

04:12:34
<transcript>: Because in here I'm not actually listening. My timer is ignoring new expire values, isn't it.

04:12:34
<transcript>: yeah

04:12:37
<transcript>: Yeah, I would have to actually like.

04:12:44
<transcript>: This needs to yeah, yeah? This needs to be.

04:12:47
<transcript>: Expires.

04:12:48
shiftlessatol: you already have the timer - you  just need the UI to show the value of the timer in real-time

04:12:50
<transcript>: And we'll just make this take in expires.

04:12:52
andreull: which course? just joined

04:12:56
<transcript>: Which is a date.

04:12:59
<transcript>: Or a string.

04:13:01
<transcript>: Or undefined.

04:13:02
cowfacedude99: @lastofusspoil I think some of the stuff is hard, but in the end once things fall in place, it is all worth it. At least that's how I think for myself LUL

04:13:02
shiftlessatol: food for thought

04:13:05
<transcript>: And then here we got to pass it in.

04:13:07
<transcript>: Fires.

04:13:13
<transcript>: We have a stale expires value there. Right.

04:13:13
<transcript>: okay

04:13:17
<transcript>: Okay. It's all very ugly, but it should work now.

04:13:24
lastofusspoil: @lastofusspoil so the hard part is debugging?

04:13:26
<transcript>: And it gets rid of our stupid timer outside of the thing.

04:13:26
<transcript>: so

04:13:28
<transcript>: So that's Kinesis.

04:13:34
<transcript>: You don't want to timer. It makes sense. Where am I? Here.

04:13:42
<transcript>: Perforating timers learning a new thing is hard, only the timer. It makes sense. However, this game is about playing as long as you can.

04:13:42
<transcript>: that's cloud

04:13:44
<transcript>: That's cloud Nine, I think.

04:13:47
<transcript>: There we go. That improves. That okay.

04:13:48
oskrm: @lastofusspoil the hardest part is designing a good structure

04:13:59
lastofusspoil: i see

04:14:01
<transcript>: Having to maintain a tick based timer keep track of the timer is redundant and causes issues having to maintain a tick based timer to keep track of the timer is redundant and causes issues.

04:14:01
<transcript>: you don't want

04:14:04
<transcript>: You don't want a timer to track a timer.

04:14:04
<transcript>: but then

04:14:06
oskrm: a good maintainable and easily read code

04:14:09
cowfacedude99: @lastofusspoil and give enough time and enough breaks, you won't think anything is difficult

04:14:14
<transcript>: But then I'm doing the calculation based on an actual date timestamp that comes from the server. Like I'm not calculating it somehow. And maybe I'm just refreshing this value.

04:14:14
<transcript>: it's a known

04:14:16
<transcript>: It's a known value.

04:14:16
<transcript>: what is that

04:14:18
<transcript>: What is that? I'm just. I'm gonna lose.

04:14:18
<transcript>: oh it went into

04:14:22
<transcript>: Oh, it went into negative. That's not that's a that's a problem.

04:14:31
<transcript>: Only 10% into my webvelopment. Of course you already have the timer. You just need the UI to show the value of the timer in real time.

04:14:31
<transcript>: which works

04:14:32
<transcript>: Which Works is joined.

04:14:36
shiftlessatol: try it out - you'll see the diff

04:14:38
<transcript>: Cafes. I think some of the stuff is hard, but in the end, okay, I'm gonna cover here. We're done for the day.

04:14:43
<transcript>: I'm trying to read through all this.

04:14:49
<transcript>: Yeah, Dave, I will. I'll try it off stream. I'll try request animation frame and see if that's better.

04:14:56
<transcript>: Okay. So I said I would come back and answer a question.

04:15:01
<transcript>: How long before I knew Stat Muse would be successful.

04:15:04
<transcript>: I think that was the question.

04:15:04
<transcript>: first of all

04:15:04
lastofusspoil: @lastofusspoil thank you guys for great advice!

04:15:12
<transcript>: First of all, thank you for the follow. Poor, Sorry, Poi, Russ, Poi Ras, and Hello, chicken.

04:15:12
loeby: I taught myself web development for about 1 year. Then I started with a few freelance projects. Now, 1,5 years later, I am a web developer and IT admin for a company

04:15:18
neochromer: @adamdotdev do you like coding? Did you code in your career?

04:15:26
crisantogo: This camera is really clean! Wow!

04:15:27
<transcript>: I really appreciate your follows. I don't just say it like I know it just sounds like I just say thank you for the follow every time I see when I say it. But I really do appreciate them because I think that means you're gonna come back. And I love having people hate with me while I work. I say it every stream, almost.

04:15:27
<transcript>: it

04:15:32
<transcript>: It just makes my work so much more fun. I was gonna be doing exactly what I did today.

04:15:32
<transcript>: but

04:15:35
lastofusspoil: @Loeby nice! that's kinda my plan

04:15:40
<transcript>: But I got to do it with a bunch of friends hanging out with me. And that's so much better. So thank you so much for your follows. I hope that means you'll be back. Thanks for the follow. Asha. Busy.

04:15:42
andreull: Hi Adam & chat. I have a question. using t3 stack. I wanna make a form to upload files. how do i display the files as preview? I upload them to db with prisma and then refetch to display them? or how does it work (with the send button too) they are uploaded in a s3 bucket at the end

04:15:53
<transcript>: and welcome to chat loabe times of web develop for a year start do you like coding did you code in your career i do like coding my career is coding i mean that's what i've done for like fifteen years that's basically all i've ever done

04:15:56
<transcript>: This camera is really clean. It is a nice camera.

04:16:00
oskrm: @andreull image?

04:16:01
lastofusspoil: 15 holy shit

04:16:03
<transcript>: Hi adamant chat. Andres here. I have a question using T three stack. I want to make a form to upload files. How do you display the file.

04:16:03
<transcript>: as preview

04:16:03
neochromer: Ahh nice nice

04:16:09
andreull: yes. images

04:16:09
neochromer: !gear

04:16:11
neochromer: !camera

04:16:11
fossabot: Adam uses two main cameras, a Sony A7S III with a Sony FE 35mm F1.8 Lens which sits behind a teleprompter and serves as the wide angle shot of the office. As well as a Sony A7 IV with a Sony FE 50mm F1.2 GM which is used for the green screen camera whilst Adam is sharing his screen.

04:16:14
lastofusspoil: ur a pro

04:16:14
mr_yan19: What do you have on the shelf behind you?

04:16:23
<transcript>: As preview, I upload them to the DB with Prisma and then refetch to display them. Or how does it work with the Sin button to their uploaded an S three bucket at the end. So first of all, Andre, I would put those I would do like a presigned URL and I would push I would have your client your browser post those files, or put them directly to S three. Don't go through.

04:16:23
<transcript>: your t

04:16:30
<transcript>: Your T Three API. Just don't. It's better to generate a presigned URL in your T Three app.

04:16:30
<transcript>: send that to the client

04:16:39
<transcript>: Send that to the client and the client post directly to that. So your client is sending data directly to S three. It's going to be better for a lot of reasons which I can impact right now.

04:16:44
<transcript>: But then the other question.

04:16:48
<transcript>: The other question.

04:16:48
<transcript>: how does it

04:16:50
<transcript>: How does it work with the send button.

04:17:05
<transcript>: How do you display the files as pretty view then in your app you'd keep track of all the files and the location and s three. So when they upload it, you kind of keep track of it that way. And then you just do a query in your database to fetch all those query, all those file names. I don't know if that answered all your questions.

04:17:05
<transcript>: that's kind of a big

04:17:07
<transcript>: That's kind of a big one.

04:17:07
<transcript>: villaus

04:17:10
<transcript>: Villaus, Villaus. Thank you for the follow. Thank you so much.

04:17:14
<transcript>: Okay, try to catch up.

04:17:19
<transcript>: Why do what do you have on the shelf behind you? Those are Lego bits.

04:17:24
andreull: okok thx.

04:17:26
gabriel1_9: !keyboard

04:17:26
fossabot: Adam uses a custom Mode Eighty mechanical keyboard, and has a collection of other Mode keyboards!

04:17:27
<transcript>: Lego Modular Buildings that I've built with my seven year old son. And we lit them. And the lighting is a whole nother story.

04:17:27
<transcript>: it took

04:17:28
dnbull: ITS A LIE

04:17:30
dnbull: GREEN SCREEN

04:17:31
<transcript>: It took a lot of time. We drilled holes. We did lots of stuff.

04:17:31
<transcript>: okay

04:17:32
oskrm: the pre-signed url returns the file url?

04:17:35
<transcript>: Okay, it's not a green screen anymore. Dimbo. It's real.

04:17:37
<transcript>: It's real.

04:17:39
<transcript>: It's a real thing.

04:17:40
andreull: good for start

04:17:43
<transcript>: I did a green screen for like a couple weeks.

04:17:43
<transcript>: to try and

04:17:45
dnbull: i dont believe you

04:17:45
<transcript>: To try and like, put stuff between me in my office.

04:17:45
<transcript>: but anyway

04:17:46
dnbull: fake

04:17:47
<transcript>: But anyway.

04:17:47
<transcript>: you don't believe

04:17:49
<transcript>: You don't believe me? Okay.

04:17:49
<transcript>: fake news

04:17:50
<transcript>: Fake news.

04:17:50
<transcript>: so

04:17:51
oskrm: *screen glitches* yeah its real

04:17:57
<transcript>: So I want to answer the question about status. We knew we built the Sat News prototype in three months.

04:17:59
mr_yan19: Very cool. codingD

04:18:01
<transcript>: and

04:18:03
<transcript>: Launched it on Twitter.

04:18:03
<transcript>: so we actually

04:18:04
<transcript>: So we actually.

04:18:04
<transcript>: we

04:18:09
<transcript>: We made a little demo. My cofounder Eli made like a like.

04:18:09
<transcript>: a

04:18:19
<transcript>: A minute long video or two minutes long of him just searching stuff on statme. So if you've never been to Statmese.com, it's like a search engine. You search questions. You get answers to sports questions.

04:18:35
ashabizzy: fake like moon landing

04:18:39
<transcript>: He made this, like, two minute video where he's just asking a bunch of questions and showing the answers. And we put that video on Twitter. And it blew up the first time, like the first night that we had announced what we had built. So we spent three months, nobody knew what we were doing. We'd put our jobs, we're building statues and then put a video up.

04:18:39
<transcript>: and

04:18:56
<transcript>: And within 48 hours, it'd been viewed in like 120 countries. It kind of blew up on Twitter. And we had the MBA reached out like the actual legal officials reached out. We had three or four teams reach out that wanted us to talk about doing analytics stuff for their team, like internal analytics.

04:18:56
<transcript>: but we had

04:19:03
<transcript>: But we had a ton of signups. We just kind of knew immediately. We were, in fact, in the first 24 hours, we were invited.

04:19:03
<transcript>: to go

04:19:06
<transcript>: To go to the Calves opener. The Cleveland Cavaliers.

04:19:06
<transcript>: dan gilbert

04:19:26
<transcript>: Dan Gilbert, who owns the Cleveland Cavaliers, invited us. Me and my cofounder went to Cleveland. We watched LeBron James come home to Cleveland after he'd been in Miami. There was a whole thing. We were really excited about that game in the first place, but we got the set court side next to LeBron's kids. And we got to go in the owner's box and meet Usher and Michael Strayhan. All these weird experiences as a developer that I had never.

04:19:26
<transcript>: had

04:19:28
<transcript>: Had.

04:19:28
<transcript>: so

04:19:33
<transcript>: So we kind of knew, like, right away. Dan wanted it in. That's why he kind of had us come out and did the whole thing.

04:19:36
yeltrah_: Wow that's awesome

04:19:38
<transcript>: Yeah. But then we ultimately did go like a year without raising.

04:19:38
<transcript>: so that was kind of

04:19:55
<transcript>: So that was kind of like an immediate high where we had this amazing experience, felt like we're on top of the world, this thing's gonna be huge. And then we went another, like, nine months before we raised our seed round. But then Disney, through ESPN, like ESPN, reporters, had made Disney aware of it. And they invested and let our A round.

04:19:55
<transcript>: google

04:20:04
<transcript>: Google invested in our A round look. At that point, we kind of knew once we raised that we had something, at least we had a lot of people interested.

04:20:04
<transcript>: financially

04:20:06
<transcript>: Financially so.

04:20:06
<transcript>: that's

04:20:14
mattmancodes: Now twitter is almost dead, you could do Premier League stats as well - without the potential soccer fan shenanigans on Twitter

04:20:15
<transcript>: That's kind of the Stammy story. But it's been eight years now since we founded Sat Mews, which is crazy to me that Sat music is still going eight years later.

04:20:15
<transcript>: almost

04:20:20
<transcript>: Almost got acquired a few times that's a whole nother story for a whole other day.

04:20:20
<transcript>: now twitter's

04:20:21
javierd__: Just joining, what is he talking about? which business/product?

04:20:28
<transcript>: Now Twitter's almost dead. You could do Premier League stats as well without the potential soccer fanciing is on Twitter. Yeah. And we've wanted to do.

04:20:28
<transcript>: cricket

04:20:36
<transcript>: Cricket and soccer, football, whatever for a long time. So we've wanted to do some of those international sports. We haven't gotten to it, but hopefully we will.

04:20:41
<transcript>: Javier, we're talking about Stat muse.com.

04:20:44
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat as well.

04:20:44
<transcript>: you're catching me

04:20:55
<transcript>: You're catching me right at the end of my stream. 4 hours, 20 minutes. Got a minute. We're gonna call it for there or for today. Thank you so much. It's been so much fun. Maybe we could do it again sometimes.

04:21:25
ayushsharma: twitter will keep running
