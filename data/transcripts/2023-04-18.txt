00:14:32
<transcript>: Tiny synapse. Welcome to Chat. What's the licks wrap it's statmus.com, and been working on it for a couple of weeks, making some changes.

00:14:32
<transcript>: we're actually

00:14:41
<transcript>: We're actually rewriting it in typescript in astro, but we had some stuff to add to it before we finish the rewrite because the rewrite takes some time.

00:14:45
<transcript>: You'll be here. But do it now. I can't do it now.

00:14:45
<transcript>: i'll do it

00:14:49
bodhihawken: yes it is, and no it isnt, iv met 1 person in my entire life with the same name (in LA actually XD)

00:14:55
<transcript>: I'll do it later Hello from Southeast Asia, Superstoopadoop welcome from Southeast Asia, or welcome from the ozarks I never know whether I should say welcome from.

00:14:55
<transcript>: if i

00:14:59
cowfacedev: well, is it going to be half an hour intro today too? LUL

00:15:04
<transcript>: If I'm saying, You're in Southeast Asia, and I'm saying, welcome to you, would I say welcome from Southeast Asia, or when I say welcome from the ozarks? That's where I live.

00:15:04
<transcript>: but welcome

00:15:05
bodhihawken: it is my first name but it isnt commone

00:15:13
cosmiclasagna: @SuperSnoopadoop hey hello from southeast asia as well!

00:15:22
<transcript>: But welcome to you in Southeast Asia. Yes, it is. And no, it isn't. Okay. So it is your first name, not a common name. I've met one person my entire life with the same name in La. Actually. Interesting. Bodie. I hope I'm saying it right as well. I have worked with a bodie.

00:15:29
<transcript>: I worked with the bodie like a contract relationship. I was working with a client that he was also working for.

00:15:41
<transcript>: And as I say that I don't know that his first name was bodie, but his Twitter handle was bodie. I don't remember his first name. Maybe that wasn't his first name. Maybe it was just a moniker, if you will.

00:15:48
<transcript>: Calface. I need you calface. I was so hoping cowface would be here today. Welcome. Also, by the way, calface.

00:15:48

00:15:51
supersnoopadoop: @cosmiclasagna :D

00:16:02
cosmiclasagna: where ya from 👋

00:16:04
<transcript>: Is going to be a half an hour intro today. No, it's going to be so fast because we got to install harpoon calface. This code base is like thousands of elixir files, and it is driving me insane. The amount of cognitive overhead for me to just remember.

00:16:04
bodhihawken: yeah your one of the only people who have said it right first time

00:16:10
<transcript>: Where was that code that I need to change? Is it in the controller? Is it in a view.

00:16:14
cowfacedev: ok.

00:16:15
supersnoopadoop: SG

00:16:16
<transcript>: I don't know. There's just so many places where there is code. I need to start pinning some files.

00:16:16
<transcript>: i'm actually

00:16:17
cowfacedev: lets go

00:16:19
<transcript>: I'm actually missing tabs.

00:16:19
<transcript>: i miss

00:16:23
<transcript>: I miss vs. Code tabs right now that's how bad it is.

00:16:32
<transcript>: So I need your help. We're going to install harpoon. I need you to give me the quickest possible rundown of how fast can I start using carpoon and not slow me down? Too much.

00:16:32
<transcript>: says the guy

00:16:34
<transcript>: Says the guy who will talk for 30 minutes.

00:16:34
<transcript>: and then

00:16:40
ocelot2123: @SuperSnoopadoop awesome! me too!

00:16:41
<transcript>: And then finally start coding and then bounce back over here for 30 minutes. Clearly, I value my time a lot.

00:16:50
<transcript>: Hello from Southeast Asia, as well. Cosmic lasagna, also from Southeast Asia, normally.

00:16:52

Don't worry about it, frag. It's so good to see you. The Dutch. There we go. Let me search for my random or for my harpoon mappings. Yes. Get those queued up. We're about to install harpoon and then get on our way because I got.

00:18:17
supersnoopadoop: What is harpoon?

00:18:17
<transcript>: Cryo is here. Actually, I came here first, but keyboard stopped working. Oh, no. So you were here. You just couldn't tell me about it.

mattmancodes: @FragAverage Oh no...

00:18:38
joostschuur: Holland is technically only 2 provinces of the Netherlands.

00:18:43
<transcript>: I know what your name says. I just try to keep this stream as pg as possible for my mother's sake, because I'm pretty sure she's here most of the time.

00:18:53
<transcript>: I feel like you guys know that. You know, my mom watches my streams. It probably affects how you view me and my streaming.

00:18:56
mndfcked: Fair enough :D

00:19:07
joostschuur: I tried to learn it, but we always spoke German at home. Never had the time to perfect it as an adult.

00:19:13
<transcript>: My mom's just always here with us. I don't know if she is. She's here sometimes. One time she said something that was fun. Netherlands is also known as Holland, I believe. Oh, my word almost as confusing as yet. Seriously, it's the UK all over again. Can you guys just pick one name? Can I call you one thing? Holland.

00:19:28
<transcript>: Netherlands, Dutch they're all completely unrelated words, but they all somehow mean sort of the same thing. A place in the world where people are from. It's the UK. I'm not doing the UK anymore. It's just you're from England. I don't know. Is that offensive.

00:19:28
<transcript>: if i just say

00:19:29
<transcript>: If I just say Everybody from the UK.

00:19:29
<transcript>: it's just

fragaverage: No, I am from England LUL

00:19:40
mndfcked: Holland is a part of the Netherlands.

00:19:41
<transcript>: It's just let's call it some. I guess I'll call it UK. I'm just not going to differentiate between the different countries. What is harpoon? You're about to find out? It's a neovin plugin made by the primogen.

00:19:42
elicxlive: The good part of the UK 👀

00:19:43
mattmancodes: Adam is going to be cancelled

00:20:13
<transcript>: Tried to learn it, but we always spoke German at home, never had the time to perfect it. As an adult. You people in Europe, you crack me up.

00:20:13
<transcript>: i didn't get around

00:20:15
cowfacedev: install it first, and I will give you my mappings.

00:20:16
<transcript>: I didn't get around to perfecting one of my third languages.

00:20:16
<transcript>: or my three

00:20:19
<transcript>: Or my three known languages. You guys are awesome.

00:20:19
<transcript>: adam

00:20:22
<transcript>: Adam's mom has gotten bored of watching him. Yeah, probably.

00:20:22
<transcript>: she's probably

00:20:25
<transcript>: She's probably not as coding for her.

00:20:34
<transcript>: Okay, the low countries. I don't know what that is. Holland is part of the Netherlands. Oh, you're telling me the Netherlands is bigger than Holland.

00:20:34
<transcript>: it's so holl

00:20:38
<transcript>: It's so Holland is a subset.

00:20:43
<transcript>: The good part of the UK am is going to be canceled by the scots. Uhoh.

00:20:43
<transcript>: okay

00:20:44
<transcript>: Okay.

00:20:51
<transcript>: They were cheating. I could tell. Yeah. So here's what I want to say about Technical feud. Yesterday.

00:20:54
cowfacedev: though they will be different for you since it depends on keyboard layout

00:21:10
<transcript>: You might think I'm going to come in hot talking about, I don't know, the way the production was run, or just how little we got to actually answer questions. That's not it. What I want to talk about is how I answered e. I went back on the VOD and checked. I knew somebody was yelling e like I said, E. I was the official bearer of like saying.

00:21:17
<transcript>: The letter E or the key E. And I got all the heat, but I went back and watched the VOD.

00:21:20
thdxr: you’re right it was melkey

00:21:20
cosmiclasagna: LUL LUL LUL

00:21:25
<transcript>: And melkey is yelling e and Chat is spamming e. It was a lot of e. Okay.

00:21:25
<transcript>: i was not the

00:21:25
monciego: E

00:21:28
<transcript>: I was not the one person who came up with the.

00:21:28
<transcript>: i just

00:21:29
thdxr: but you shoulda had better judgement

00:21:34
laytanl_: what key was it actually?

00:21:40
laytanl_: space?

00:21:42
cosmiclasagna: W

00:21:43
<transcript>: I justified it. I came up with a reason. Okay. It's the most common used letter in the English language. We'll go with E, should have had better judgment. Yeah, you're right, dex. I should have guessed W or F. Those were the two remaining keys.

00:21:43
<transcript>: no

00:21:43
joostschuur: ‘Netherlands’ means ‘low country’ and includes all the Benelux countries (Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg). OK, geography lesson over.

00:21:44
cosmiclasagna: and F

00:21:46
cosmiclasagna: LUL

00:21:48
<transcript>: No space was number one. That was number one was just taken very quickly.

00:21:52
cosmiclasagna: you were off by one key

00:21:55
cosmiclasagna: on the keyboard

00:22:00
<transcript>: Yeah, those were some the shift prime guess. Shift. That wasn't one like there were some odd things. So if anything, I think throwing out a random letter was maybe a good move.

00:22:06
<transcript>: Script. Thank you so much for the follow. Okay, we're going to come over here and install harpoon.

00:22:06
<transcript>: we're going

00:22:25
joostschuur: Argh, to correct that. The Low Countries are Benelux, Netherlands is one of them. OK, shut up Joost.

00:22:25
<transcript>: We're going to install harpoon. Then we got to get to work on some elixir. I actually streamed today. I considered not streaming. I had so much to get done, but I streamed because I need help. I need help with elixir. And I need help in sewing harpin. So thanks, Calface, for that. Let's see. Let's do. I don't need help installing it.

00:22:25
<transcript>: it sounds like

00:22:28
<transcript>: It sounds like I'm not giving myself enough credit here.

00:22:28
<transcript>: i just need help

00:22:39
<transcript>: I just need help, like, quickly getting up to speed. So I'm not wasting time reading and learning. And I just need those quick, like, here's you're off. You can pin some files bounce around between them.

00:22:42
<transcript>: Let's go.

00:22:42
<transcript>: files

00:22:47
<transcript>: Files. Let's push the config neo VM.

00:22:54
earholesmcgee: how do you get those tab looking things that have the file or git icon on it???

00:22:57
<transcript>: Who feels like that's going to go poorly. I kind of feel like that's going to go poorly.

00:23:02
<transcript>: I've already got harpoon. I already have it. People.

00:23:09
<transcript>: I don't have to save the style. That's great. So I already have a harpoon. I just have to set it up and map it and stuff.

00:23:12
<transcript>: Like I probably don't have anything in here for it.

00:23:15
<transcript>: Harpoon.

00:23:17
schrew: oh no, we're in the dotfiles

00:23:19
<transcript>: What is the minimal.

00:23:19
<transcript>: the minimal set

00:23:21
<transcript>: The minimal setup. I guess I'll open the docs.

00:23:25
<transcript>: Prime Gen. Harpoon.

00:23:32
<transcript>: Okay. Cafe. You sent me your mappings. Perfect.

00:23:35
<transcript>: I was off by one on the keyboard. That's true.

00:23:38
<transcript>: It was almost ease, right next to W.

00:23:38

<transcript>: Geographic geography lesson over. Thank you so much. Yoast, I really appreciate it.

00:24:00
<transcript>: I'm not going to remember it. I'm still not sure I remember all the UK stuff.

00:24:00
<transcript>: but

00:24:02
<transcript>: But I appreciate.

00:24:09
cowfacedev: I have them mapped to my two middle and index fingers. prime has it mapped to his one hand.

00:24:10
<transcript>: Arg to correct that the low countries are benelux. Netherlands is one of them. Okay, you're financed.

00:24:15
<transcript>: Someday maybe I'll be cultured Maybe I'll travel and be cultured.

00:24:20
cowfacedev: you can choose your own poison

00:24:21
<transcript>: Is this a file called harpoon? Okay, so this is all your harpoon maps.

00:24:24
<transcript>: I got a lot of eyelashes in my eyes today or some.

00:24:26
thdxr: Argh, to correct that. The Low Countries are Benelux, Netherlands is one of them. OK, shut up Joost.

00:24:32
<transcript>: Choose your own poison. It's not Twitter time yet. Everybody's trying to get me on Twitter. What's going on here.

00:24:32
<transcript>: how do you

00:24:36
<transcript>: How do you get those tab looking things that have the file or git icon on it.

00:24:40
<transcript>: We'll look at that in just a second ear holes.

00:24:43
<transcript>: We're in the Dot Files. Oh, boy.

00:24:43
<transcript>: have them ma

00:24:53
<transcript>: Have them mapped to two middle and index fingers. Prime has it mapped to his one hand. You can choose your own poison. Okay, Art, to correct that to look. Oh, my God.

00:24:56
<transcript>: Oh, DAX.

00:24:58
laytanl_: leader h,j,k,l is mine for harpoon

00:25:06
<transcript>: Oh, dax, I can't wait for this new segment. I'm just so excited. It's going to be a recurring segment. I might do it multiple times each stream.

00:25:09
<transcript>: I might.

00:25:13
<transcript>: I'm pretty excited. Okay, let's get harpoon installed.

00:25:16
thdxr: i’m worried

00:25:21
cowfacedev: line 7to 11 are the ones that you want to map the keymaps to alt+key

00:25:23
<transcript>: So I need to configure it. Probably. We've been installed it now. I need to do the configure. Maybe. No. Do I not. Is there no configuration needed.

00:25:30
<transcript>: Yeah, register as a telecope. Oh, telescope extension. Oh, I have to. Okay, that's if I want telescope support.

00:25:37
<transcript>: Okay. Here we go. Configure. Just like this. Require harpoon.

00:25:40
joostschuur: @thdxr 👀

00:25:44
<transcript>: Am I in the file? Yeah. Harpoon, lua.

00:25:50
<transcript>: But I probably need to do something other than that. Okay? Require harpoon setup.

00:25:51
sockthedev: yay, back to the stream

00:25:52
goblin__________________: Hi all

00:26:01
cowfacedev: and you need 3 and 4 to bring up and add files to the list

00:26:01
<transcript>: Sets the marks upon calling toggle on the ui instead of required W any config stuff do I need to do Besides the default cow face.

00:26:14
<transcript>: Sock is here. We're back to the stream. We are back. Cosmic. Thanks so much for the tier One. Hey.

00:26:14
<transcript>: you

00:26:20
laytanl_: I just use the default config

00:26:23
laytanl_: just need mappings

00:26:25
<transcript>: You cosmic lasagna from Southeast Asia. I really appreciate it. Did I get it right? Did I get your locale correct? I feel like you even said, what country, but we won't go that far.

00:26:25
<transcript>: just for

00:26:30
cosmiclasagna: yeah u got it o7

00:26:32
mattmancodes: The UK is easy, it's Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England. England is the dominant country that all the others hate except for half of Northern Ireland who are madly in love with the Monarchy.

00:26:32
<transcript>: Just for Privacy reasons. But did I get it right? Cosmic altar. You're also from Southeast Asia, right.

00:26:32
<transcript>: i didn't

00:26:34
cowfacedev: I think I will drop this into the discord.

00:26:36
<transcript>: I didn't watch it. You got it. Thank you so much.

00:26:36
<transcript>: for

00:26:41
<transcript>: For the sub. The tier one sub is what it was. Thank you.

00:26:41
<transcript>: the uk

00:26:47
<transcript>: The UK is easy. No, we're not talking about the UK. Just use the default config. Just need mappings. Got it.

00:26:53
sockthedev: cosmic, I am living in bali

00:26:57
<transcript>: I got it. So let's see. Do we want to print foo? No, I'm not going to print foo. We're going to do this. What's? No. Remap. Oh, jeez, can I not use these.

00:26:57
<transcript>: i don't

00:27:00
<transcript>: I don't have no remap.

00:27:00
<transcript>: i think

00:27:04
<transcript>: I think we'll drop this into the discord. Please, do cafes.

00:27:14
<transcript>: Sacla's in bali. I can't use these. I don't have whatever this thing is and we've already discussed. I won't be adding any plugins today because I'm afraid it'll break all.

00:27:14
<transcript>: many of them

00:27:20
<transcript>: Many of them. So I just need to spiritually remap these in spirit.

00:27:20
<transcript>: in spirit

00:27:21
<transcript>: In Spirit only.

00:27:21
<transcript>: let's go

00:27:26
cosmiclasagna: @sockthedev hello !

00:27:27
<transcript>: Let's go into our maps. Sometimes I use maps. Sometimes I don't. Sometimes.

00:27:29
<transcript>: I.

00:27:29
<transcript>: harpoon

00:27:32
<transcript>: Harpoon Sometimes I do sometimes I don't.

00:27:36
cosmiclasagna: very close to here in the ph

00:27:36
<transcript>: I think I can actually translate these pretty easily.

00:27:40
<transcript>: Do I need all these we'll find out.

00:27:41
sockthedev: 👋

00:27:43
<transcript>: No remap.

00:27:48
<transcript>: We're going to do this. We're going to say.

00:27:50
<transcript>: No.

00:27:52
<transcript>: N no.

00:27:52
<transcript>: rem

00:27:56
<transcript>: Remap. We're going to change to keymap.

00:28:02
<transcript>: How we feeling? What else do we need to do here.

00:28:02
<transcript>: require

00:28:06
<transcript>: Require harpoon Mark ad file is this all going to work.

00:28:06
<transcript>: is it all

00:28:09
earholesmcgee: Is it true that VIM makes you a faster dev, but all that saved time is used configuring Vim?

00:28:09
<transcript>: Is it all going to work just like this.

00:28:11
<transcript>: Nav file one.

00:28:14
thdxr: no

00:28:16
<transcript>: You've got M? What is M? Is that like.

00:28:16
<transcript>: a special

00:28:16
laytanl_: Need to add "n" as first arg to all these

00:28:18
<transcript>: A special key.

00:28:24
<transcript>: Need to add in its first R to all these. Oh, okay.

00:28:26
<transcript>: I see.

00:28:29
<transcript>: Because.

00:28:32
<transcript>: What is in Sandford normal mode.

00:28:37
<transcript>: Okay, yank those.

00:28:37
laytanl_: yes

00:28:37
cowfacedev: m is meta/alt key

00:28:38
<transcript>: No.

00:28:44
<transcript>: This is where a macro understanding of macros would be very helpful.

00:28:49
<transcript>: Just every time I try to learn macros, I'm like maybe later.

00:28:55
<transcript>: Okay. I guess. Can I just do this? Let's see. Let's do this.

00:28:58
sockthedev: @earholesmcgee I spent the first 2 months rewriting my config many times, but i am ultra happy with it now, and only make minor tweaks and updates occassionally

00:29:00
cowfacedev: you don't need line 38.

00:29:11
<transcript>: Oh, God, no. And then if I do this period. No, that's not going to work. Okay, cool. We're just doing it the painful way. I wish it wouldn't keep adding quotes. That would be fun. That would be great.

00:29:11
<transcript>: let's just

00:29:13
<transcript>: Let's just do this.

00:29:13
<transcript>: yank it

00:29:15
<transcript>: Yank it right.

00:29:15
<transcript>: yank

00:29:17
<transcript>: Yank and then paste.

00:29:21
<transcript>: Feeling slow.

00:29:24
<transcript>: Feeling pretty slow.

00:29:26
<transcript>: Okay.

00:29:33
<transcript>: We did it. We made it.

00:29:33
<transcript>: you don't need line

00:29:36
cowfacedev: and also. you need to move those tnhe mappings somewhere else.

00:29:36
<transcript>: You don't need line 38. Well, what is line 38.

00:29:39
<transcript>: A relative line 38.

00:29:39
<transcript>: what's line thirty eight

00:29:40
laytanl_: @cowFaceDev what is <M-w> and rest?

00:29:42
<transcript>: What's line? 38. Oh, you mean in your file.

00:29:46
sockthedev: @thdxr has a really minimal config. thinking there is a big win in that approach. i like some extra whistles myself

00:29:47
<transcript>: I don't need line 38. There is no line 38.

00:29:51
<transcript>: What we talking about.

00:29:55
cowfacedev: honestly wait..

00:30:04
<transcript>: M is meta alt key. Okay. Need to add in as first. Okay, we did that. Is it true that vim makes you a faster dev? But all that saved time is used. Configuring them. No. Yes.

00:30:06
<transcript>: Consensus.

00:30:06
<transcript>: tannin bomb

00:30:11
cowfacedev: -4 from 102

00:30:12
<transcript>: Tannin bomb. Thank you so much for the follow cannonbaum. I know a tannin bomb.

00:30:20
<transcript>: I know a tanna bomb. I'm sure there are more than one tanna bombs in the world.

00:30:20
<transcript>: but

00:30:23
<transcript>: But eli, My cofounder is good friends with the tannin bomb.

00:30:29
thdxr: royal tennenbaums

00:30:30
cowfacedev: and everything below 3

00:30:35
<transcript>: If that's you. I mean, it's a small world, right? We're connected through eli. You could have ended up on my stream because of that. I don't know. Just throwing it out there. Is that the tandem bomb. Different tannibalm. Probably different Tannabaum.

00:30:45
thdxr: adam did you gain weight?

00:30:48
<transcript>: In his medici. I said the first two months rerun my okay, you don't need line 38. Also, you need to move those mappings somewhere else. Those tnhe mappings you're saying don't use yours.

00:30:48
<transcript>: don't

00:30:51
<transcript>: Don't use what you do here.

00:31:00
cowfacedev: you don't need

00:31:02
<transcript>: Why did you do that this way? Why did you do the command syntax.

00:31:02
<transcript>: when up here

00:31:06
<transcript>: When up here you're doing require why'd you do the lua, that whole thing.

00:31:12
<transcript>: What is NW.

00:31:15
<transcript>: Special KeyW.

00:31:25
<transcript>: Has a really minimal config thinking there's a big win in that approach. Like some extra whistles. Honestly, wait, minus four from 102. What.

00:31:25
<transcript>: so one

00:31:29
<transcript>: So 102 you're saying Go minus four lines.

00:31:31
<transcript>: This one.

00:31:35
<transcript>: Royal Royal tenon bombs.

00:31:35
<transcript>: and everything below

00:31:38
<transcript>: And everything below three. I don't know what you're saying, cafes. I don't need.

00:31:41
<transcript>: Here from 98.

00:31:41
<transcript>: give me

00:31:50
<transcript>: Give me absolute line numbers. No relative. Did you gain weight? Are you serious? Tax? Did I. Do I look heavier? I don't know where'd that come from.

00:31:54
mattmancodes: hahahaha

00:31:54
cowfacedev: tnhe correspond to my ring fingers.

00:31:55
<transcript>: I don't think I've gained weight. I don't weigh myself. I don't know.

00:32:02
cowfacedev: you don't need 98.

00:32:02
<transcript>: They correspond to my Ring fingers.

00:32:03
thdxr: i’m just messing with you lol

00:32:06
<transcript>: Can I get some absolute line numbers here.

00:32:10
<transcript>: I'm just messing with you, okay.

00:32:10
<transcript>: i don't know

00:32:11
<transcript>: I don't know. I probably did gain weight.

00:32:18
<transcript>: I've not been exercising enough. Especially the last couple of weeks. I've been so stressed.

00:32:18
<transcript>: hammering

00:32:23
<transcript>: Hammering this stuff out. Okay, we got to get moving here.

00:32:28
<transcript>: Calvin says I don't need things, but I don't know what I don't need.

00:32:41
<transcript>: T N H e. I just need to be able to T N H e o. Because you don't use quirty, do you? Are you not a quirty, man? So I can put them on anything I want, right? I'm just going to do like alt. And then my right hand.

00:32:47
<transcript>: So alt starting with hjl. Maybe. I don't think I use those for anything.

00:32:50
<transcript>: H.

00:32:52
<transcript>: J.

00:32:54
<transcript>: K L.

00:32:59
<transcript>: Nav file five. Can I do five.

00:32:59
<transcript>: because i feel like

00:33:02
<transcript>: Because I feel like I might need five. Actually.

00:33:06
thdxr: gg, shift v, G, d

00:33:08
<transcript>: Okay. We're going to do those five.

00:33:12
<transcript>: Shiftvgd? What are you talking about.

00:33:14
thdxr: that will fix

00:33:17
cowfacedev: and you don't need anything below this.

00:33:21
<transcript>: I don't need 98. Okay, why don't I want to toggle the quick penal. Oh, there's two of them.

00:33:25
sockthedev: has anyone else found prettier removes half your buffer when editing markdown files?

00:33:26
mattmancodes: @thdxr hahaha

00:33:33
laytanl_: @thdxr Great advice here adam

00:33:38
<transcript>: Okay, so here we go. We got Leader NA is harpin Marc. So add a file to the list. Leader Ni is toggle the quick menu. And then we've got one through five. I've got on alt, H, jkl, whatever.

00:33:40
<transcript>: And then what is this.

00:33:40
<transcript>: toggle

00:33:43
<transcript>: Toggle Quick menu. We already have that.

00:33:43
<transcript>: right

00:33:47
<transcript>: Right. So I don't need that. You're saying.

00:33:54
<transcript>: You don't need anything below this below. What? Like where I'm at right now.

00:33:58
cowfacedev: you don't need anything below 105

00:33:59
<transcript>: Okay. We're just removing all this, and I'm moving on.

00:33:59
<transcript>: harpoon

00:34:02
<transcript>: Harpoon. Go to Terminal. Do I need those.

00:34:05
<transcript>: Anything below 105. Okay.

00:34:05
<transcript>: cool

00:34:06
<transcript>: Cool.

00:34:06
<transcript>: feels good

00:34:08
cowfacedev: those were for harpoon terminal.

00:34:11
<transcript>: Feels good feels good I think we're harpooned let's see if it works.

00:34:11
<transcript>: we're going to go

00:34:16
<transcript>: We're going to go back here, and I'm going to have to quit neo vim.

00:34:16
<transcript>: nvim

00:34:17
<transcript>: Nvim.

00:34:17
<transcript>: those

00:34:17
cowfacedev: since you use tmux, you don't need it

00:34:26
<transcript>: Those were for harpoon. Terminal. Okay, I don't need it. I got tmux. Okay, let's try harpoon. So it was leader.

00:34:27
sockthedev: lol, harpooned

00:34:29
<transcript>: Ni.

00:34:29
<transcript>: har

00:34:38
<transcript>: Harpoon. Okay, so let's open up this code base is such a giant mess. It's not a mess. It's probably well organized.

00:34:38
<transcript>: it's so giant

00:34:41
<transcript>: It's so giant. At this point, it's impossible for me to work in.

00:34:41
<transcript>: okay

00:34:43
<transcript>: Okay.

00:34:51
cowfacedev: there's harpoon tmux, but I haven't used it at all.

00:34:53
<transcript>: Which controllers directory? Would you like, would you like api controllers? Or would you like the Client controllers? Or would you like.

00:34:53
<transcript>: would

00:34:58
mattmancodes: nice that it's called Mothra though

00:34:59
<transcript>: Would you like the oh, in the mothra. There's probably some controllers. No.

00:34:59
<transcript>: controller

00:35:04
<transcript>: Controllers in here. That's good. There's only two folders or controllers.

00:35:06
<transcript>: I can't even.

00:35:10
<transcript>: Okay. So I'm going to add this one as my first.

00:35:12
laytanl_: I have my harpoon files in my lualine

00:35:12
cowfacedev: harpoon files works for me full time

00:35:15
laytanl_: verry pog

00:35:21
<transcript>: To my harpoon. It's going to be NA then Ni. There it is. User controller. Feels good. Now if I want to go to it, let's just open up another one. Client.

00:35:21
<transcript>: assign

00:35:23
<transcript>: Assigns visual.

00:35:24
techsavvytravvy: heyyy

00:35:25
<transcript>: Controllers.

00:35:25
<transcript>: ask

00:35:29
<transcript>: Ask controller. I don't need that right now.

00:35:29
<transcript>: i do need

00:35:30
<transcript>: I do need.

00:35:33
<transcript>: The Pro template open.

00:35:36
<transcript>: Plug that one.

00:35:44
<transcript>: There we go. We got two of them in harpoon. Thank you so much. Prime. Open source. How about it? How about open source software.

00:35:49
<transcript>: We're going to open up the router. I'm going to have this on.

00:35:49
<transcript>: three i guess

00:35:51
<transcript>: Three, I guess.

00:35:52
<transcript>: Tool.

00:35:52
<transcript>: okay

00:35:56
<transcript>: Okay. And then we're going to open up. Let's see.

00:36:03
<transcript>: Author. Web. No, don't open this. I was thinking I might open up.

00:36:04
<transcript>: The.

00:36:08
<transcript>: Migration file.

00:36:08
<transcript>: now i'm going

00:36:23
<transcript>: Now I'm going to skip on the migration. I think it's good for now. If I need to add more to the database, then we'll deal with it. Okay router. I've got the controller for the api, the api controller. If you will not be confused with.

00:36:23
<transcript>: the

00:36:28
<transcript>: The Ask controller. And do I need that open? What did I change in these.

00:36:30
<transcript>: Root controller.

00:36:33
<transcript>: What does this one do.

00:36:39
<transcript>: This is where we open the pro page. I probably don't need to touch this again.

00:36:42
<transcript>: In fact, I can just delete. That. Okay.

00:36:46
<transcript>: Any others that I need to pin. That's the question.

00:36:52
<transcript>: Ions. I think for now it's those three files I'm bouncing between. Well, no, there's definitely more.

00:36:52
<transcript>: let's see

00:36:53
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:36:53
<transcript>: in here

00:36:54
<transcript>: In here.

00:36:54
<transcript>: we've got

00:36:58
<transcript>: We've got stripe checkout. We're going to add this one.

00:37:03
<transcript>: So now I've got 1234 in kind of a weird order.

00:37:05
dmdboi: Deadmau5 gang

00:37:11
techsavvytravvy: i've been looking at elixir lately, i might have to try it out

cowfacedev: the way I use harpoon is by 3 in harpoon at max and use telescope buffers for the rest.

00:37:23
pbertrand_dev: I'm seeing very little E's here

00:37:28
<transcript>: How does it not take it all up there's? Harpoon? Tmux. But I haven't used it at all. Wow.

00:38:08
<transcript>: Yeah, it is called mothra. We have gamera. We have mothra, we have Geigan and jabira or aberra. We have all kinds of godzilla monsters. Harpoon Files works for me full time.

00:38:31
<transcript>: Dead mouse gang. That's right, diamond. I've been looking trav. I've been looking at Elixir later. I might have tried out. Well, hey, I'm going to show you some elixir more Elixir than you'll ever want to see on this very stream. Because this code base is giant. The way I use Harpoon is by three in harpoon at Max and use telescope buffers for the rest. Okay, that's the problem, though. This code base.

00:38:31
<transcript>: is so

00:38:43
<transcript>: Is so giant. I search in telescope buffers. I'm like, Where did it do the proxy thing? And it's like infinite list. And then I'm scrolling. I'm scrolling through the list of.

00:38:55
<transcript>: Telescope buffers. It's obnoxious. This code base is so giant. There's so much redundancy and naming and things like that that it's impossible to just navigate with telescope. I need some harpoon, pinned files.

00:38:55
<transcript>: okay sorry

00:39:02
sockthedev: what is mothra?

00:39:03
mecoupz: 10k adam bucks SeemsGood

sockthedev: you seem to work on a new project each day, how do you get anything done?

00:39:22
<transcript>: Oh, e. I got it. Nothing. Finally woke up in time for your stream. Yeah, I started a little late trav. I'm working for you. Good morning, trailer trash. Sock. What is mottra? It is the stamps.com api. Boy, it's like the Web. It's the back end for the front end for sapmus.com.

<transcript>: Try the troll drag. Yeah, I got to do something. I got to fight back.

00:40:31
<transcript>: oh

00:40:40
<transcript>: Oh, that's harpoon and lou align, but pretty involved, so we can get into it. Yeah, we'll do it later. That is a great idea, though. I love the idea. So let's see if I can actually navigate to a harpoon thing.

00:40:42
<transcript>: No.

00:40:42
<transcript>: can't

00:40:43
<transcript>: Can't.

<transcript>: No. I mean, good thing I use tmux, I guess. But where is. Oh, there it is. That just hit it. Okay. So that was not the key. I think I need to change. Hang on. I got to change these M on a Mac does not seem to work. I think I remember this. I can't bind to the code key, so I'm going to have to do like control. But I don't know. Control. H is control.

00:41:18
<transcript>: used

00:41:28
<transcript>: Used for any of these things. I had trouble with using alt M in my config due to alacrity. Is it alacrity slot? Maybe it is. Can I do control hj.

00:41:29
<transcript>: hjl

00:41:30
<transcript>: Hjl.

00:41:30
<transcript>: and

00:41:34
<transcript>: And semicolon. Is there anything I'm going to be using those for.

00:41:44
cowfacedev: check your keymaps.

00:41:44
laytanl_: you can do alt by typing alt h in insert mode and using the character it inserts as the mapping

00:41:47
<transcript>: Anybody now? Is it? C is control. C. I have so many questions. I'm sorry. I need you people today. I need you. Was zach's even here for dax Sachs? I feel like he wasn't even here.

<transcript>: let's see

00:45:00
<transcript>: And.

00:45:00

mattmancodes: We need to know about the dogs though

00:45:53
mecoupz: the question is, where did you got those dax facts?

00:45:55
<transcript>: Love it so much. I'm going to do, like, multiple every stream. Probably you're going to copy me, but Adam doesn't rhyme with facts. Adam facts is not nearly as catchy. So good luck copying me.

00:45:55
<transcript>: or you're going to

00:46:04
<transcript>: Or you're going to give dax sex as well. Because you could do that. You actually have some backseacks. I don't actually know facts. I'm just making stuff up.

00:46:04
<transcript>: where did you

00:46:09
<transcript>: Where did you get those dax facts? Oh, I mean, they're all absolutely 100% accurate.

<transcript>: i

00:46:37

00:47:13
cosmiclasagna: @techsavvytravvy i wonder what segment name dax can do for adam

00:47:17
<transcript>: So it's not so much that I'm going to remember the number I don't think for me.

00:47:18
mecoupz: dax fax sounds so great @techsavvytravvy

00:47:23
thdxr: @techsavvytravvy trueee

00:47:32
<transcript>: It's that I'm just going to know I can cycle through the files I've been working in, and that's enough for me in this code base. It's such a nightmare just to keep track of the files I'm bouncing around between it's like having tabs again, but better.

00:47:34
<transcript>: Okay.

00:47:44
<transcript>: Can we get those weather temperatures in celsius? I'm afraid not. Diamonds. I don't know, celsius. And I don't remember the conversion rate.

00:47:46
imshootex: ohh gotcha

00:47:47
<transcript>: Okay.

00:47:53
<transcript>: Feel like Daxax was a missed opportunity. Oh, yeah, that's a good call, trav. We could still change it.

00:47:53
<transcript>: we

00:48:00
<transcript>: We could still change it. I feel like I need a better ending. I feel like the ending needs to be.

00:48:00
<transcript>: like

00:48:01
<transcript>: Like.

00:48:08
<transcript>: I don't know. The ending is just a little anticlimactic when it exits the scene. I think I need like a better sound or something.

00:48:12
<transcript>: We'll workshop it. We'll get there.

00:48:13
mecoupz: add that sound from your twitter videos ending

00:48:18
<transcript>: I wonder what segment name add up or DAX can do for Adam? Yeah? What could you do? Dax.

<transcript>: so there's

00:49:43
<transcript>: So there's an infinite number of them.

00:49:43
<transcript>: but also

00:49:44
<transcript>: But also.

00:49:44
<transcript>: i kind of

00:49:54
<transcript>: I kind of like just everything I do on the internet has this similar sound and theme. I'm okay with reusing stuff across mediums doesn't bother me.

00:50:03
<transcript>: And I already do like I use we use the theme for Tomorrow. That's what I made the stuff for originally. It was for the podcast, which, by the way, DAX.

00:50:03
<transcript>: i guess

00:50:08
<transcript>: I guess one came out yesterday. Did one come out yesterday? We need to record.

00:50:08
<transcript>: are we behind

00:50:12
tom1269_: Maybe “Adam datum”, but sounds too formal?

00:50:15
<transcript>: Are we behind? No. We just need to record sometime this week before React Miami. Just let me know, let me know? Dax.

00:50:18
<transcript>: Okay.

00:50:21
<transcript>: I got to actually get some stuff done now.

00:50:28
<transcript>: So this is the user controller subscribe. Does this.

00:50:31
thdxr: we had some idea i forgot

00:50:34
<transcript>: Oh, and I need this file open, too. I need this harpooned.

00:50:38
<transcript>: We had some idea. Yeah. I think somebody gave us an idea, didn't they.

00:50:45
<transcript>: Somebody gave us an idea.

00:50:45
<transcript>: what did they give

00:50:48
<transcript>: What did they give us? Why is that not going to definition.

00:50:51
<transcript>: Well.

00:50:54
<transcript>: Somebody gave us something.

00:50:54
<transcript>: i don't remember what

00:50:58
<transcript>: I don't remember what it was. Here we go. This file is already pinned. Okay, so.

00:51:05
<transcript>: Excuse me. I think I just need to return this.

00:51:10
<transcript>: We're going to do this.

00:51:18
<transcript>: Response. And we're going to just delete all this, okay, so this thing just gives you the whole response back.

00:51:21
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:51:24
<transcript>: Api. Post.

00:51:30
<transcript>: Feels good. I think that's all good.

00:51:35
<transcript>: Trying to get a stripe redirect working and you guys will see here shortly.

00:51:35
<transcript>: now if i go back

00:51:40
<transcript>: Now if I go back to this file create checkout session, it actually returns.

00:51:40
<transcript>: a map

00:51:42
<transcript>: A map. So let's see.

00:51:45
<transcript>: Map with URL.

00:51:51
<transcript>: Is this how you do it in elixir. I don't even remember. How do you deconstructure an elixir.

00:51:54
<transcript>: Like that.

00:51:57
<transcript>: Oh boy.

00:52:00
<transcript>: Or I could just say response.

00:52:06
<transcript>: Response.

00:52:06
<transcript>: and then

00:52:08
<transcript>: And then redirect.

00:52:11
<transcript>: To response. Url.

00:52:14
<transcript>: Okay.

00:52:14
<transcript>: let's see

00:52:17
<transcript>: Let's see, creates a checkout session.

00:52:21
<transcript>: How.

00:52:22
thdxr: adam factum

00:52:25
<transcript>: Create checkout session user.

00:52:27
<transcript>: Are we not using email.

00:52:27
<transcript>: adam

00:52:29
<transcript>: Adam factum.

00:52:32
<transcript>: Here's a good one.

00:52:32
<transcript>: now what was their idea

00:52:35
<transcript>: Now what was their idea? Do you pasted it somewhere? I feel like.

00:52:35
<transcript>: you pasted it

00:52:36
<transcript>: You pasted it.

00:52:36
<transcript>: in chat

00:52:38
<transcript>: In chat or something.

00:52:38
<transcript>: response

00:52:41
<transcript>: Response call to missing or exported function.

00:52:46
<transcript>: Is undefined or private.

00:52:50
<transcript>: Do I have to pass the connection.

00:52:50
<transcript>: i

00:52:53
<transcript>: I want to remove that requirement. Actually.

00:52:58
<transcript>: Let's see if I can do this. Four. There it is.

00:53:02
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't need this.

00:53:05
<transcript>: Pass in a user. Okay, cool.

00:53:06
imshootex: man your keyboard is so clicky

00:53:09
imshootex: I want it

00:53:10
<transcript>: Checkout session.

00:53:13
<transcript>: Guess I need to do the same thing here.

00:53:19
<transcript>: Cool.

00:53:19
<transcript>: feels

00:53:25
<transcript>: Feels good. So no user. We create a user for them, and then we redirect them.

00:53:25
<transcript>: okay

00:53:26
thdxr: oh getting into open source

00:53:27
<transcript>: Okay, let's try this.

00:53:30
<transcript>: Let's try it.

00:53:35
<transcript>: We're on stat, muse.

00:53:35
<transcript>: com

00:53:36
<transcript>: Com.

00:53:41
<transcript>: Going to refresh the page just in case.

00:53:41
<transcript>: getting into

00:53:45
<transcript>: Getting into Open Source. Oh, yeah, that's what it was. Yes.

00:53:45
<transcript>: shoot

00:53:57
<transcript>: Shoot. X. My keyboard is so clicky. It is it's quite clicky? I could just do ASMR streams and I think people would listen. Oh, my. I miss something. I missed a lot of things. Wow. I'm so sorry. Q biscuit.

00:53:57
<transcript>: and

00:54:05
<transcript>: And Eric, thank you for the follows. And also Kettlemel, thank you for the resub. Two months.

00:54:05
<transcript>: thank you so

00:54:08
thdxr: mine is clickier

00:54:12
<transcript>: Thank you so much, Kettlemel. I can't believe I missed that. Was that just happening in my ears? And I was just totally zoned in. I'm actually getting focused.

00:54:15
<transcript>: Minus click Here. Oh, man.

00:54:21
imshootex: proof

00:54:22
<transcript>: Dax always trolling me. Okay, here we go. Is this just going to work? What if it just worked? First try.

00:54:22
<transcript>: i would like

00:54:23
laytanl_: ohh its focused

00:54:24
kauai_life: @thdxr what about they keyboard though?

00:54:27
<transcript>: I would like probably take a break. Nope. Didn't work. Okay. What happened.

00:54:29
<transcript>: So this.

00:54:29
<transcript>: do

00:54:30
<transcript>: Do.

00:54:30
<transcript>: this actually

00:54:32
<transcript>: This actually works. No.

00:54:35
<transcript>: Not an atom.

00:54:38
<transcript>: Okay.

00:54:42
<transcript>: Body url. There's the checkout link.

00:54:42
<transcript>: str

00:54:45
<transcript>: Strike Customer ID is null.

00:54:45
<transcript>: that's

00:54:47
<transcript>: That's not good.

00:54:47
<transcript>: but i actually don't

00:54:49
<transcript>: But I actually don't need it either.

00:54:52
<transcript>: Errors were found.

00:54:52
<transcript>: so

00:54:55
<transcript>: So responsive. Stripe. Okay, body.

00:54:55
<transcript>: oh

00:54:59
<transcript>: Oh, it's got an okay on it. I don't need the okay.

00:55:02
<transcript>: Easy solve.

00:55:05
<transcript>: Url can never match.

00:55:09
<transcript>: Let's go back here and let's say.

00:55:12
<transcript>: Do API post is going to be.

00:55:12
<transcript>: okay

00:55:21
<transcript>: Okay. We're not going to return. Okay. So if I just do create checkout session like this, can I just do that.

00:55:24
<transcript>: Does that work for any function.

00:55:32
<transcript>: Can never match the type. Does that work? Did I do it.

00:55:41
<transcript>: No, I guess you have to do something special to a function in elixir to make that possible. Here's what we're going to do. We're not going to return.

00:55:41
<transcript>: okay

00:55:42
<transcript>: Okay.

00:55:48
<transcript>: We're just going to return. Let's see. Okay. Nobody error here. We're just going to return.

00:55:52
<transcript>: We're do we return anything.

00:55:55
<transcript>: Code.

00:56:02
<transcript>: I want to destructure.

00:56:02
<transcript>: let's just

00:56:04
<transcript>: Let's just do this.

00:56:09
<transcript>: Is this how you do it.

00:56:13
<transcript>: Does anyone know elixir? Here? Am I alone? Today.

00:56:16
<transcript>: Let's see it's going to be.

00:56:22
<transcript>: Okay. And then response.

00:56:26
<transcript>: No, not how you do it.

00:56:35
ccitadin: remove %

00:56:40
ccitadin: good

00:56:42
<transcript>: See, it like in a matching statement. But I'm just like, assuming I'm making assumptions here. That it's. Good. Thank you. Thank you, Citaden, for knowing elixir.

00:56:48
<transcript>: It's focused.

00:56:52
<transcript>: It's focused. Okay, this might just work. Now.

00:56:59
<transcript>: Let's do this. Let's go, let's go. Here we go.

00:57:01
<transcript>: Here we go.

00:57:09
<transcript>: Here we go subscribe to Stapmese. Pro.

00:57:12
<transcript>: Let's go redirect me.

00:57:12
<transcript>: redirect

00:57:14
<transcript>: Redirect me Daddy.

00:57:14
<transcript>: come on

00:57:16
<transcript>: Come on.

00:57:21
<transcript>: Did it fail? Oh, I didn't even look at the log. I failed.

00:57:26
<transcript>: Url. Not found in body. Oh, it's inside body.

00:57:29
<transcript>: Oh, I need to unwrap that, too.

00:57:30
mecoupz: daddy not liking adam

00:57:31
<transcript>: Okay.

00:57:40
<transcript>: Daddy not liking Adam. Yeah, adam's not very good at elixir. I got to remember, we're rewriting this entire code base.

00:57:49
<transcript>: We're well on our way to having this whole code base replaced, so I need not worry about making this thing the best for licker code, if you will.

00:57:52
<transcript>: Body.

00:57:52
<transcript>: like this

00:57:53
<transcript>: Like this.

00:58:03
thdxr: but do you have to make it the worst elixir code

00:58:04
<transcript>: Now, how could I unstructure that even better? Oh, I know what I'll do. Just respond. I'll just return response. Body.

00:58:06
<transcript>: Done.

00:58:08
<transcript>: Fixed.

00:58:11
mecoupz: did you asked DaxGPT?

00:58:16
thdxr: lol

00:58:17
<transcript>: You have to make it the worst solution code. No, I guess I don't do. I. Nate, nate, nate, nate, nate, nate, nate, nate. Thank you for the follow.

00:58:20
<transcript>: Did you ask dax? Gpt.

00:58:23
<transcript>: That's funny.

00:58:25
<transcript>: That's pretty funny.

00:58:35
hyeheal: are u rewriting this whole elixir api in another language?

00:58:41
ccitadin: it's acceptable

00:58:51
<transcript>: All right. Subscribe to Status Pro. Let's go, let's go. Stripe. Come on. No. Still something still something wrong? Are you rewriting this whole licker api in another language? Yes. How you heal? Welcome to Chat. It's not just an api. It's the entire website. We've already rewritten most of it in astro. Just a better fit for what we're doing.

00:58:51
<transcript>: not

00:58:58
<transcript>: Not necessarily a better fit than Alex or Phoenix. Just a better fit than this repo, which is more than just.

00:58:58
<transcript>: elixir phoenix

00:59:03
<transcript>: Elixir. Phoenix. Okay, what's wrong here? So body has that stuff.

00:59:04
mecoupz: *dax did rewrite it Kappa

00:59:08
<transcript>: Still enjoy stripe custard ID is now we'll look into that converted error.

00:59:08
<transcript>: bad

00:59:10
<transcript>: Bad key body.

00:59:14
<transcript>: Is because there's a null. No. Surely not.

00:59:14
<transcript>: what

00:59:19
<transcript>: What's wrong? Converted error bad key body. I can't just say body.

00:59:24
<transcript>: Can I not get it out of it just by doing dot body.

00:59:30
<transcript>: Knot found.

00:59:30
<transcript>: in body

00:59:31
<transcript>: In body.

00:59:31
<transcript>: how do i get

00:59:33
<transcript>: How do I get that, then.

00:59:39
<transcript>: I can't use body I have to do like, what do I have to do.

00:59:43
<transcript>: I have to do it like this. Like an atom.

00:59:43
<transcript>: does that

00:59:48
<transcript>: Does that work? Somebody tell me, is that going to work? Or do I have to do, like, response.

00:59:51
<transcript>: Get no. What is it.

00:59:55
<transcript>: App get map, get.

00:59:55
<transcript>: sp

01:00:04
<transcript>: Sponsored. Yeah, that was it. Why did copilot go away map get response body like that.

01:00:13
<transcript>: Drying is pretty cheap. Just hit the button again.

01:00:16
<transcript>: Just click the button.

01:00:22
<transcript>: It's acceptable.

01:00:23
theslowdev: you can also do this: resp["body"]

01:00:26
<transcript>: Is it acceptable? What I just did is acceptable.

01:00:26
<transcript>: i could also

01:00:34
<transcript>: I could also do response. Oh, okay. So there's, like, index like that. Is this gonna work? Is it gonna work? No, it's not gonna work.

01:00:34
<transcript>: except for

01:00:36
<transcript>: Except for.

01:00:36
<transcript>: not an

01:00:43
<transcript>: Not an atom. First argument, not an atom. So it did need to be okay. Let's just do this.

01:00:44
sockthedev: reading harpoon docs. how do you remove a mark?

01:00:46
ccitadin: your elixir code is acceptable

01:00:47
<transcript>: Like this. This is better.

01:00:51
wesleimp: is that an open source project?

01:00:54
imshootex: not an adam

01:00:55
<transcript>: I think that's better I don't know why I don't know why I think that's better.

01:00:55
<transcript>: but

01:00:57
<transcript>: But I think that's better.

01:00:58
ccitadin: better than majority

01:01:02
theslowdev: without the map. But I don't know the response

01:01:06
<transcript>: You can also do this. Thank you. Slow dev, by the way. Reading harpoon. Docs, how do you remove a Mark? Oh, great question, sock. I have no idea.

01:01:12
<transcript>: I guess. Just reassign it. Your elixir code is acceptable. Thank you so much. Visa den. Thank you.

01:01:12
<transcript>: is that an open

01:01:19
mecoupz: i dont know elixir but your code still looks better than the old c# code with 50k lines that i have to work with lol

01:01:20
<transcript>: Is that an open source project? Wesley statues is not open source. We've talked about open sourcing it. I don't know that anyone would get much out of it.

01:01:20
<transcript>: unless they were

01:01:24
<transcript>: Unless they were trying to create a sports search engine.

01:01:24
<transcript>: but we've talked

01:01:28
<transcript>: But we've talked about it. Not an atom. That's right.

01:01:28
<transcript>: without

01:01:31
laytanl_: @sockthedev you can "dd" on the line of the mark in the overview list

01:01:39
imshootex: @sockthedev I just delete the line in the ui

01:01:39
thdxr: i’ll submit prs to statmuse

01:01:42
dmmulroy: harpoon_mark.rm_file()

01:01:45
sockthedev: ah perfect thanks

01:01:45
<transcript>: Without the map, but I don't know the response without the map, but I don't know the response. I don't know, elixir, but your code still looks better than the old C sharp code with 50,000 lines that I have to work with. To be fair, I did not ride a lot of this code. You can DD on the line of the Mark in the overview list.

01:01:45
<transcript>: oh really

01:01:49
<transcript>: Oh, really? Oh you can toggle.

01:01:52
<transcript>: It. I'm not any of them right now.

01:01:54
<transcript>: Not an atom.

01:01:58
<transcript>: Not an atom. Does this need to be an atom.

01:02:02
<transcript>: That.

01:02:07
dmmulroy: my harpoon key binds: https://github.com/dmmulroy/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/nvim/lua/user/keymaps.lua#L140-L180

01:02:08
<transcript>: We're just trying things. I don't know. I'm just kind of guessing at this point.

01:02:10
<transcript>: Like I'm just guessing.

01:02:16
<transcript>: I'll submit prs to stamp use. Do it, dax. What would you add to status.

01:02:16
<transcript>: i just delete

01:02:18
impostorengineer: just curious, why not leave these issues to someone else and maybe work on creating the new statmuse.

01:02:18
<transcript>: I just delete the line in the UI cool.

01:02:18
mecoupz: adam forgot to start keycastr

01:02:29
<transcript>: Very cool one of these times, I'm going to click this button. It's going to take us to stripe, and I'm going to freak out. Forgot to start keycaster oops. I'm on it.

01:02:36
<transcript>: Starting at start, start casting. Here we go. Function. Nilurl is undefined.

01:02:36
<transcript>: nil

01:02:39
<transcript>: Nil. Okay. So now I'm getting nil.

01:02:39
<transcript>: how do i

01:02:42
<transcript>: How do I take okay, response.

01:02:45
<transcript>: Response is.

01:02:50
<transcript>: A B code by maybe down here I just need to return.

01:02:52
<transcript>: Okay.

01:02:56
<transcript>: Body.

01:02:58
<transcript>: Well, right here we've got the body.

01:03:08
<transcript>: Decode body. We should just be returning the body from do API post right? How is that not what's being returned.

01:03:10
<transcript>: What am I missing? Here.

01:03:14
<transcript>: Tell me what I'm missing.

01:03:14
<transcript>: here

01:03:15
ccitadin: tesla > httpoison

01:03:17
<transcript>: Here. Is this what's? Returning? Right here.

01:03:25
<transcript>: Tesla greater than http poison so citadin.

01:03:25
<transcript>: yeah

01:03:37
ccitadin: oh, ok

01:03:37
<transcript>: Yeah. This code base is like 6756 years old. It's pretty old. So there are probably lots of things that we made choices back then. That could be better choices now. But like I said, we are rewriting it.

01:03:45
<transcript>: So there's that. Wow. My kid just fell out of bed or something that was so loud. Somebody tell me what I should do here.

01:03:45
<transcript>: am i interpret

01:03:51
<transcript>: Am I interpreting this code correctly? Is do API posts returning this. Okay. Right here.

01:03:51
<transcript>: this okay right

01:03:53
<transcript>: This. Okay. Right here.

01:03:55
imshootex: LUL

01:03:56
<transcript>: That what's being returned.

01:03:56
ccitadin: tesla is better to test, just this

01:03:58
<transcript>: If so.

01:04:02
<transcript>: Isn't that just the body we decoded? Body.

01:04:05
<transcript>: Doesn't that return.

01:04:06
<transcript>: The body.

01:04:06
<transcript>: or

01:04:08
<transcript>: Or not.

01:04:15
ccitadin: nothing greatfull

01:04:15
<transcript>: Oh no. Because this whole thing equals. Okay. So let's just do this body and then.

01:04:15
<transcript>: equals

01:04:16
<transcript>: Equals.

01:04:16
<transcript>: i want to

01:04:20
<transcript>: I want to return body. Just the body.

01:04:22
<transcript>: Okay.

01:04:24
thdxr: tesla is legit

01:04:24
<transcript>: Right.

01:04:27
<transcript>: The body's wrapped in a body, isn't it.

01:04:40
<transcript>: Well, that doesn't actually solve my problem, because that's just getting rid of the okay, and I don't need to get rid of the okay, I need to get rid of the nested. I think it's just hang on. It's just over here. Body.

01:04:42
<transcript>: Body.

01:04:50
<transcript>: So why is that Blank stripe, Customer ID.

01:04:54
imshootex: oh, @adamdotdev you could also just cycle through the harpoon marks, was that already suggested?

01:04:55
<transcript>: You're not creating a customer might not be.

01:04:58
bodhihawken: i keep thinking your saying my name

01:05:01
<transcript>: Customer Reference ID Customer email.

01:05:04
<transcript>: Bodie. I'm sorry.

01:05:04
<transcript>: body

01:05:05
<transcript>: Body.

01:05:14
<transcript>: You could also just cycle through the harpoon marks. Was that already suggested? Yeah, that's what I do. Shoot. Text. Second thing. The harpoon marks.

01:05:22
<transcript>: This is actually in a different entirely different neo of him session though this is two separate projects.

01:05:30
<transcript>: So I guess I have to return it in a wrapped body like that.

01:05:30
<transcript>: i need to

01:05:32
<transcript>: I need to understand.

01:05:34
<transcript>: How do I.

01:05:34
<transcript>: get

01:05:39
<transcript>: Get where am I? How do I get the body out of this response.

01:05:39
<transcript>: just want to

01:05:41
<transcript>: Just want to return response.

01:05:41
<transcript>: body

01:05:43
<transcript>: Body.

01:05:48
<transcript>: And I can't seem to do that. Oh, let's try the map, get, map, get.

01:05:51
<transcript>: Yeah but body.

01:05:55
<transcript>: By that I don't know.

01:05:58
<transcript>: Again. I fucking guessing. I don't like guessing.

01:06:02
<transcript>: Tell me how I can unpack that thing.

01:06:06
<transcript>: And it's kind of hilarious to me to think of how fast I could have made.

01:06:06
<transcript>: this stuff

01:06:09
sockthedev: wow, harpoon is really rad. so glad i joined stream

01:06:09
<transcript>: This stuff with not being an elixir.

01:06:09
<transcript>: i'm just not that

01:06:12
<transcript>: I'm just not that familiar with elixir.

01:06:12
<transcript>: and that

01:06:15
<transcript>: And that has slowed this whole thing down. So much.

01:06:22
<transcript>: I'm so glad you joined the Stream, too. Sock.

01:06:29
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm a fan of harpoon so far. Big fan. Convert air undef.

01:06:29
<transcript>: undefair

01:06:32
darrenbaldwin03: Are you going to react miami?

01:06:33
<transcript>: Undefair function. Nil. Okay, so I'm returning. Nil.

01:06:33
<transcript>: so

01:06:36
thdxr: i regret joining

01:06:39
<transcript>: So it is not okay. Let's just return response. Let's go back over here.

01:06:47
<transcript>: This is where we get the response. It's response. Body url. Maybe it was just that body.

01:06:50
<transcript>: Other thing we could try.

01:06:53
bodhihawken: i suck at learning shortcuts but i think i need to use harpoon, our codebase is too big

01:07:00
<transcript>: Yeah. Here we go, here we go. I don't need this open anymore.

01:07:04
<transcript>: Well, I might I might need that open.

01:07:07
<transcript>: Regret joining.

01:07:07
<transcript>: why oh

01:07:19
<transcript>: Why? Oh, so glad socks. So glad you regret it, Darren, I not going to React Miami. Unfortunately, I thought I could push real hard, get this stuff done early this week and then still go to React Miami. I just can't and I have to.

01:07:21
sockthedev: so cool that you can edit the harpoon quick list with standard vim commands

01:07:36
<transcript>: Get this done. Basically this week I suck at learning shortcuts, but I think I need to use harpoon. Our code base is too big. That's exactly why I needed tarpoon. This code base is too big. I've never felt the pain in like small projects. In this project I cannot keep it all sort body not found in body.

01:07:42
<transcript>: Okay, someone tell me, what is this? This is a map, right? And it has a key. Body. Right.

01:07:45
<transcript>: And in that key body.

01:07:49
<transcript>: There is oh, does this need to be json decoded.

01:07:49
<transcript>: this is

01:07:51
<transcript>: This is a string.

01:07:55
darrenbaldwin03: Thats a hash

01:07:55
<transcript>: Oh, that needs to be decoded.

01:07:59
darrenbaldwin03: Ur gonna need to decode

01:08:02
<transcript>: But I can't even unwrap just the body. I can't even get this part out. Why? It's a hash.

01:08:02
<transcript>: going to need

01:08:07
<transcript>: Going to need to decode. Okay, Darren, I'm tracking. Help me.

01:08:13
<transcript>: So it's cool that you can edit the Harbor and quicklist with standard bin commands. That is cool. You can just edit the path and stuff.

01:08:13
<transcript>: you're going to need

01:08:15
<transcript>: You're going to need to decode.

01:08:20
<transcript>: So this thing right here. You're telling me.

01:08:23
<transcript>: I don't need any of this stuff.

01:08:23
<transcript>: i don't need the

01:08:28
<transcript>: I don't need the cookies or the headers. I just need to return the body from that original function.

01:08:28
<transcript>: and

01:08:36
<transcript>: And it needs to be decoded like this needs to just be like an actual object I can interact with, or I just need to return the URL.

01:08:36
<transcript>: maybe

01:08:40
thdxr: adam

01:08:43
<transcript>: Maybe that's all I need. I'll just return the URL. So how do I get the URL out of that object? That's the question.

01:08:45
thdxr: i know the answer

01:08:51
<transcript>: In here response. Was that thing that you just saw. How do I get it out? Do I need to start chat gbting.

01:08:52
mecoupz: chatgpt -> how to decode json response body in elixir

01:08:53
thdxr: atoms and string keys are different

01:08:56
bodhihawken: why is this so hard in Elixer, it takes like 2 seconds everywhere else XD

01:09:01
<transcript>: Thank you, Dean moy, for the three months. Tier One, let's go. Adams and Stream keys are different. Okay? Find axe. So tell me what I should type.

01:09:09
<transcript>: I'm going to have to just start chat gbt how to decode thank you. How to decode a json response body in elixir.

01:09:09
<transcript>: you know

01:09:10
thdxr: so resp[“body”]

01:09:17
<transcript>: You know the answer to X. Could you just give it to me? Why is this so hard in elixir? It takes like 2 seconds everywhere else. So response body. Okay.

01:09:17
<transcript>: that

01:09:21
dnbull: adamdevKappa adamdevKappa adamdevKappa adamdevKappa

01:09:25
<transcript>: That didn't work earlier, but you're saying that would work? We already did. Json. Decode on the body. Right here, right.

01:09:27
thdxr: show me the error in the console again

01:09:30
<transcript>: Different body, though this is a different body. This is the body of.

01:09:30
<transcript>: the

01:09:35
<transcript>: The like there's actually a key body is a json payload and the key.

01:09:35
<transcript>: in that

01:09:54
<transcript>: In that payload body is what I need to pull something out. Show the area in the console. Okay, here we go. Max. Save me five minutes, please. I could start Chad gbt, but I feel like twitch chat is so much faster. Usually key body not found in that thing. Here's the thing that I need to extract the URL out of.

01:09:57
<transcript>: The inbowl has got work to do that's totally understand.

01:09:59
bodhihawken: im so excited to see the new codebase XD

01:10:01
<transcript>: Totally understand. Ian Bull.

01:10:03
mecoupz: maybe you need to remove ":" from your key?

01:10:06
<transcript>: Thank you for the two months. Wait. Did I already say that? No. Thank you for the resub.

01:10:06
<transcript>: also

01:10:10
mecoupz: so not :body but more so only body

01:10:11
thdxr: yeah do json[“body”]

01:10:21
<transcript>: Also cloud. Thank you for the follow dmbo. My favorite Miami. So excited to see the new code base. Oh, yeah, it's so great. Maybe you need to remove that from your key. So not body, but more so only body. So json body.

01:10:27
<transcript>: Okay, so here you're saying I should do this? I'm pretty sure we already tried this, and it failed, but okay.

01:10:27
<transcript>: response

01:10:29
<transcript>: Response, body.

01:10:29
<transcript>: oh wait

01:10:31
<transcript>: Oh, wait json.

01:10:34
<transcript>: We did. Jason.

01:10:34
<transcript>: decode

01:10:39
<transcript>: Decode. And then we got whatever it decoded. Here.

01:10:42
<transcript>: Right.

01:10:50
<transcript>: And I destructured the okay out of it. So then this should be the thing that just ran through json. Decode, right.

01:10:56
dmmulroy: @bodhihawken if you use telescope, you can hook harpoon up to telescope rather than its default ui

01:11:00
<transcript>: But then the contents of this are actually a string that I need to decode.

01:11:03
<transcript>: I guess I need to do like.

01:11:08
<transcript>: This.

01:11:13
<transcript>: Right.

01:11:19
<transcript>: Based on the code response body do okay error. Okay.

01:11:19
<transcript>: and then

01:11:21
<transcript>: And then this is.

01:11:22
<transcript>: The.

01:11:24
thdxr: just use decode!

01:11:29
<transcript>: This is the actual body.

01:11:29
<transcript>: okay

01:11:30
<transcript>: Okay.

01:11:33
<transcript>: And I want to.

01:11:39
<transcript>: Turn body.

01:11:39
<transcript>: url

01:11:45
<transcript>: Url. That's what I want to do. Is that going to work? Just use the code. What.

01:11:50
<transcript>: Code was an exclamation Mark where? Oh, yeah, I see.

01:11:54
<transcript>: And then I don't need the okays.

01:11:56
<transcript>: I can just do this.

01:12:06
thdxr: don’t even need a case

01:12:15
<transcript>: Okay. Just like that.

01:12:15
<transcript>: oh but

01:12:18
<transcript>: Oh, but I still needed to.

01:12:23
<transcript>: Handle some errors here. I should probably handle errors.

01:12:29
<transcript>: With this X don't even need a case, but what if there's an error? Decoding.

01:12:31
<transcript>: And I.

01:12:31
<transcript>: didn't need to

01:12:34
<transcript>: Didn't need to extract the URL from it too.

01:12:36
bjufre: But then if it fails you would need to rescue or something unless you don't care about crashing

01:12:38
<transcript>: Right.

01:12:52
thdxr: just let it crash

01:12:52
<transcript>: Then if it fails, you would need to rescue or something. Unless you don't care about crashing. I do care about crashing. Bi. Welcome to Chat. Welcome to Chat. Also, not serious. Thank you for the follow. Appreciate your follow.

01:12:55
wesleimp: you can do {:ok, %{"body" => body}}

01:12:57
<transcript>: Yeah, we're going to do it like this. Stacks. It's safer. Just let it crash.

01:12:57
<transcript>: why

01:12:58
<transcript>: Why.

01:12:58
<transcript>: okay

01:12:59
thdxr: erlang philosophy

01:13:00
<transcript>: Okay, body, body.

01:13:06
<transcript>: What.

01:13:06
<transcript>: ten right here

01:13:08
<transcript>: Ten. Right here.

01:13:12
<transcript>: Just do okay? And then body, body.

01:13:13
thdxr: erlang philosophy is let it crash

01:13:19
<transcript>: Erling philosophy is to let it crash.

01:13:21
wesleimp: yes

01:13:21
<transcript>: Actually believe you.

01:13:30
dmmulroy: get down w/ the OTP

01:13:32
thdxr: yeah good recommendation from wes

01:13:32
<transcript>: Let your babies die or whatever. Kill your children. Right. Okay. But now, sub json code.

01:13:38
<transcript>: Off that body, and then.

01:13:39
<transcript>: Like that.

01:13:39
<transcript>: tell me if

01:13:41
<transcript>: Tell me if this is right.

01:13:46
<transcript>: Good recommendation from wes. You can do okay. Body. Body. So up here.

01:13:49
<transcript>: I can do.

01:13:53
<transcript>: Body.

01:14:00
<transcript>: And this would just be body, right? Just like that. Is that what you're saying.

01:14:09
<transcript>: Did I reassign body. I did. Wait. Did I? Yeah, that's body, too.

01:14:09
<transcript>: payload

01:14:10
<transcript>: Payload.

01:14:18
<transcript>: I don't know if I can. Maybe I can reassign it, but I'm just going to do that instead. Okay. So we have body.

01:14:26
<transcript>: Then we decode the body and we get the URL from it. Is this good? Is this good? You're down with the OTP.

01:14:29
bjufre: Yes it is, but aat the same time if you can control when to let it crash better. The times that I write  Elixir that I let it crash is when I know for sure something MUST be there and it is not, then ok just crash as that should've happened in the first place

01:14:30
wesleimp: % instead $

01:14:30
<transcript>: Actually knows some elixir and Rlang stuff. I just forgot most of it.

01:14:38
<transcript>: Oh, I did what did I do? Dollar sign? Oh, Jeez.

01:14:55
<transcript>: Oops, that was silly. Yes, it is. But at the same time, if you can control when to let it crash better. The times that I write elixir that I let it crash is when I know for sure something must be there. And it is not then. Okay, just crashes. That should have happened in the first place.

01:15:01
<transcript>: Yeah, if this isn't safe.

01:15:01
<transcript>: someone yell

01:15:04
<transcript>: Someone yell at me if we shouldn't do it like this.

01:15:07
<transcript>: Create checkout session.

01:15:12
<transcript>: Is this going to get the url? I'm going to try it because no one's telling me if this is right or not.

01:15:16
thdxr: I mean it's going to crash eventually because of the invalid json tuple

01:15:17
<transcript>: Is it right? Or is it going to break.

01:15:17
<transcript>: i don't

01:15:18
<transcript>: I don't want to guess.

01:15:18
<transcript>: it's going to

01:15:22
<transcript>: It's going to crash eventually because of the Invalid json. Tuple.

01:15:27
thdxr: and the stack trace is going to be worse

01:15:29
<transcript>: What's happening.

01:15:32
simplyjohannes: Is that logger supposed to be working on the body or payload?

01:15:32
<transcript>: Error what happened.

01:15:36
<transcript>: Converted Air Bad match.

01:15:45
<transcript>: No match of right hand side value error. Okay, so I got an error on http.

01:15:45
<transcript>: this scenar

01:15:47
<transcript>: This scenario coming out of here.

01:15:48
thdxr: 500 response

01:15:51
<transcript>: No.

01:15:54
<transcript>: Right that didn't return an error.

01:15:58
thdxr: you got a 500 from stripey boy

01:16:03
<transcript>: What's wrong here? It's saying this was not okay. We had an error coming out of this.

01:16:03
<transcript>: we got a five hundred

01:16:07
<transcript>: We got a 500 from stripe. What.

01:16:07
<transcript>: stripe

01:16:09
<transcript>: Stripey boy.

01:16:09
<transcript>: welcome

01:16:10
thdxr: should I keep helping adam or go work on my react miami talk

01:16:20
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Simply johannes. Johannes, is that logger supposed to be working on the body or payload? Oh, did I? Did I do something? Did I log the wrong inspect body.

01:16:21
bjufre: @thdxr then yes, if that's something that doesn't allow to keep the flow then I would let it crash

01:16:23
<transcript>: I guess it should be.

01:16:23
<transcript>: this whole

01:16:25
<transcript>: This whole thing.

01:16:25
vapor__dev: Stripey boy

01:16:29
<transcript>: Let's do that.

01:16:33
<transcript>: Stripey, boy, I got a 500 from stripe. Are you sure.

01:16:36
<transcript>: It's not stripe that I'm calling.

01:16:36
<transcript>: i'm

01:16:41
thdxr: maybe not

01:16:43
thdxr: nvm

01:16:45
<transcript>: I'm calling an sst api that wraps stripe. Let's look at the ssc console just to see because ssc is super cool.

01:16:48
<transcript>: Let's see. Was this just now.

01:16:48
<transcript>: yeah

01:16:50
thdxr: SST api never crashes

01:16:51
<transcript>: Yeah? Request? No.

01:16:51
<transcript>: i

01:16:54
<transcript>: I got a nice response from my API.

01:16:54
<transcript>: didn

01:16:58
<transcript>: Didn't I? Yeah. There's the url. Everything's fine.

01:17:01
<transcript>: So what happened.

01:17:07
<transcript>: Sstapi never crashes. So what is this error.

01:17:07
<transcript>: bad

01:17:09
<transcript>: Bad match.

01:17:15
<transcript>: Let's try again, because now I have better logging, or I actually have logging.

01:17:21
<transcript>: Then yes. If that's something that doesn't allow to keep the flow, then I would let it crash.

01:17:21
<transcript>: should i keep

01:17:29
<transcript>: Should I keep helping Adam or go work on my React Miami talk? You should absolutely keep helping me multitrack, multitask.

01:17:36
<transcript>: Okay. I should have better logging in place now.

01:17:41
<transcript>: Not an atom.

01:17:51
<transcript>: So here's a response from stripe from stripe api, which is not accurate. It's not actually from the stray pi. It's from my api. Okay, and then we have body.

01:17:51
<transcript>: like

01:17:53
bodhihawken: @bodhihawken Copy that! yeah our codebase apparently just hit 380 Thousand lines of code NotLikeThis

01:17:55
<transcript>: Like somehow. Let me figure this out. I'm just going to paste it in a chat gbt.

01:17:55
<transcript>: you people

01:17:59
<transcript>: You people you're dead to me. Just kidding. New chat.

01:18:02
<transcript>: I have.

01:18:02
<transcript>: the following

01:18:04
<transcript>: The following.

01:18:07
<transcript>: Response from.

01:18:09
<transcript>: Hd poison.

01:18:12
<transcript>: And elixir.

01:18:12
<transcript>: and

01:18:17
<transcript>: And I need to extract the URL out of it.

01:18:32
<transcript>: Oh, come on. What.

01:18:35
<transcript>: No.

01:18:45
<transcript>: Chat, GPT is down, twitch, chat is down. You guys are all not helping me. Well, you are helping me, but I haven't figured it out yet. And now Chad gbt is down.

01:18:48
<transcript>: What am I going to do.

01:18:50
mcnets: Refresh

01:18:51
thdxr: adam's brain is down

01:18:52
cosmiclasagna: I think you just refresh and itll work

01:18:52
thdxr: as usual

01:18:55
<transcript>: 380,000 lines of code.

01:18:55
<transcript>: ad

01:18:58
<transcript>: Adam's brain is down, it's true.

01:19:02
<transcript>: Let's refresh and see if it's better.

01:19:07
vapor__dev: One of those mornings bro

01:19:09
mecoupz: chatgpt knows you're the macbook scam guy, doesnt wants to help you out

01:19:11
<transcript>: Yes. Okay. Check your o from Response for Coin Jason showing the body. Then accessing the url key.

01:19:16
<transcript>: You can achieve this in elixir using the json library.

01:19:20
<transcript>: I've already done that one of those mornings. It really is.

01:19:30
bjufre: You get map a map, and you need to get the "body" and parse it through the Jason decode

01:19:32
<transcript>: Thank you for the refresh suggestion. Mcnett's and cosmic. It worked. It worked. It worked. One of those mornings. Sheddy bd knows you're. The macbook Scam guy doesn't want you to help you out.

01:19:36
<transcript>: The macbook Scam guy you get.

01:19:36
<transcript>: map

01:19:42
<transcript>: Map a map, and you need to get the body and parse it through the json decode. Yes.

01:19:44
2dorkstv: morning, ya'll!

01:19:44
<transcript>: So response.

01:19:49
<transcript>: So they're just putting the response there.

01:19:56
<transcript>: They're going to show me how to handle response. Feels good. Good morning, two. Dorks. Good morning.

01:19:58
thdxr: if you use ! functions everywhere this will all be cleaner

01:20:08
<transcript>: To use exclamation Mark functions everywhere. This will all be cleaner. I believe you.

01:20:08
<transcript>: i believe

01:20:10
<transcript>: I believe you.

01:20:14
<transcript>: What is it doing right now? It's still typing out, though. Okay.

01:20:17
<transcript>: Body equals response.

01:20:17
<transcript>: okay

01:20:19
<transcript>: Okay, decoded, body.

01:20:19
<transcript>: is it

01:20:21
<transcript>: Is it that simple.

01:20:21
<transcript>: anyone

01:20:23
<transcript>: Anyone think it's that simple.

01:20:23
thdxr: makeHttpCall() |> Map.get(:body) |> Map.get("body") |> Jason.decode!()

01:20:24
2dorkstv: I'm a big fan of using chatGPT as a pair programming buddy. It's been wrong a lot, but generally gets me over the hump

01:20:27
<transcript>: I just don't know.

01:20:31
<transcript>: Like something I'm breaking down somewhere.

01:20:37
<transcript>: So it's saying, if I do this.

01:20:39
<transcript>: Let's just do this.

01:20:52
<transcript>: Okay, body. Okay, decoded, body.

01:20:56
<transcript>: And then just return.

01:20:59
<transcript>: I just want to try what it said.

01:20:59
<transcript>: before i do

01:21:00
thdxr: makeHttpCall() |> Map.get(:body) |> Jason.decode!()|> Map.get("body") |> Jason.decode!()

01:21:01
<transcript>: Before I do anything else.

01:21:10
<transcript>: Want to see if I can trust chat GBD.

01:21:14
<transcript>: Make http call map getbody.

01:21:14
<transcript>: json

01:21:19
<transcript>: Json decode map. Get body json to code.

01:21:25
<transcript>: You saying that's what I should be doing. I feel like I've done all these things. And it's not worth.

01:21:25
thdxr: we should pair program where you tell me what you're trying to do and I control the keyboard

01:21:36
vapor__dev: DaxGPT

01:21:38
<transcript>: Big fan of using chai gbt as a pair of program. Buddy, it's been wrong a lot, but generally gets me over the hump. I agree. Two dorks. We should pair a program where you tell me what you're trying to do and I control the keyboard. That sounds actually kind of fun. Dex, we should do that.

01:21:43
bjufre: @thdxr hahahah

01:21:45
<transcript>: Let's try this. I feel like we've done all of the different ways to access body, and it fails every time.

2dorkstv: I'd watch that @thdxr :D

01:21:50

01:21:55
<transcript>: What do I got to do to get the body out of this thing.

<transcript>: json code

01:28:06
bausmeier: Oh. `redirect(conn, external: url)` then.

01:28:11
<transcript>: Okay, I need a serious response here. How do I redirect to an external url? Does it have to be a relative url? Oh, external.

01:28:11

01:29:33
<transcript>: To location this.

01:29:41
<transcript>: Why would there be a Coresair? Never knew debugging could be comical and entertaining. Well, I'm so glad simply that you're in.

01:29:43
thdxr: is subscribe an xhr call?

01:29:44
<transcript>: Thank you for following me as well.

01:29:44
<transcript>: this

01:29:45
thdxr: or is it a redirect

01:29:45
<transcript>: This.

01:30:32
thdxr: the call to subscribe needs to be a redirect

01:30:34
pbertrand_dev: hard to see what the actual issue is with the audio delay

01:30:35
<transcript>: Here's a request to api subscribe. It's a post and it comes back with a 302. Oh, that should be a 303. Shouldn't it? That should be a 303.

01:30:35
<transcript>: the

01:30:36
thdxr: not an xhr req

01:30:37
sm1sko: Oh yeah maybe it is on your side

01:30:42
<transcript>: The call scribe needs to be a redirect. Yeah, it's a redirect, but it's 302, it should be 303, right for a post.

01:30:42
<transcript>: i know

01:30:46
thdxr: you can't redirect off an xhr request

01:30:48
<transcript>: I know things. How do I make this a status code? Kind of. See, status.

01:30:48
<transcript>: code

01:30:49
<transcript>: Code.

01:30:49
<transcript>: something

01:30:54
<transcript>: Something? No. I mean status code. Like this. Three or three. Does that work.

01:31:04
<transcript>: You can redirect off an Xi Jr of course it's a post, but it needs to be redirected with a 303 and 7302 right.

01:31:08
thdxr: you can?

01:31:10
bausmeier: Dax is right. Change it to a form submission?

01:31:11
<transcript>: Hard to see what the actual issues with the audio delay. Stop it.

01:31:12
kittyborgx: 302 implies its on your end

01:31:15
<transcript>: You can. I'm pretty sure change to a form submission.

01:31:15
<transcript>: three

01:31:19
<transcript>: 302 implies it's on your end.

01:31:19
<transcript>: oh if

01:31:21
<transcript>: Oh, if it's a form submission, it works.

01:31:27
bausmeier: How are you calling subscribe on the front end?

01:31:30
<transcript>: Is that the problem? The call to subscribe needs to be a redirect.

01:31:36
gitpush_gitpaid: you guys embarrassed me yesterday. how do you guys get skunked?

01:31:40
<transcript>: Yeah, I'll show you how I'm doing it, but 302 I need to make it a 303 I know I need to redirect as a 303 it's a post I know I need to redirect how do I do that.

01:31:40
<transcript>: in

01:31:44
<transcript>: In elixir. I could just look it up. I guess.

01:31:47
<transcript>: Lixer, redirect.

01:31:47
<transcript>: set

01:31:49
<transcript>: Set status code.

01:31:49
<transcript>: i just do it

01:31:51
<transcript>: I just do it on connection.

01:31:57
kittyborgx: the amount of tabs lol

01:32:04
<transcript>: Here we go, here we go. I don't know if this is going to fix my issue, but I know it's more correct, and I want to fix.

01:32:04
<transcript>: it

01:32:05
<transcript>: It.

01:32:05
<transcript>: redirect

01:32:06
thdxr: I don't think a 303 would change anything

01:32:06
<transcript>: Redirect.

01:32:12
<transcript>: Status before the redirect. I could do that.

01:32:15
gitpush_gitpaid: wait did that guy ever give out the link for the gift or whatever

01:32:16
<transcript>: What.

01:32:18
thdxr: adam have you done web development before?

01:32:21
<transcript>: Thank you. I'm shoot X for the one month Tier One sub.

01:32:21
<transcript>: have

01:32:24
<transcript>: Have you done Web development before Stop it.

01:32:35
<transcript>: It probably wouldn't change anything. It's just more semantically correct. It's more correct. If you're doing a redirect from a post which I will be doing, it needs to be a 303, not a 302.

01:32:35
<transcript>: okay

01:32:38
bjufre: If you're doing xhr from the frontend you can't, you should use  normal page navigation or form submission like

01:32:41
<transcript>: Okay. I guess I'm just going to do this. I guess I'm going to do Con.

01:32:48
<transcript>: Set status code. Is that what it is.

01:32:49
bjufre: dxr says

01:32:51
<transcript>: Redirect.

01:33:02
pbertrand_dev: yeah you want it to be correct because there are people who read status codes

01:33:07
<transcript>: This unfamiliar set. That what is it? Set? Status.

01:33:13
<transcript>: Is that status? What is it.

01:33:15
<transcript>: I do want it to be correct.

01:33:15
<transcript>: okay yeah

01:33:21
neugestaltet: why did you guys decide to use elixir when starting to build the app with millions of users? And would you use something else if you would start building it today?

01:33:23
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah. We'll use normal page notification. We'll use a form submission. We will do that. But I want to get this right before I do.

fossabot: Statmuse uses Elixir because an early engineer particularly enjoyed it. It's a great language and an intro to functional programming so you should check it out https://elixir-lang.org/

01:33:44
<transcript>: Why did you guys decide to use elixir when starting to build the app with millions of users? And would you use something else if you would start building today? Great question. Noogie. First of all, we start building it seven years ago. We didn't know it would have millions of users. We hoped, and we were building something for consumers. So there's a lot of sports fans. We did hope it would be huge, but we didn't know that at the time. And it's only really grown a lot.

01:33:44
<transcript>: in the last couple

01:33:46
gitpush_gitpaid: @neugestaltet he said they hired an intern that wanted to use it

01:33:48
thdxr: ADAM STOP EXPLAINING IT

01:33:51
thdxr: WE HAVE A THINGY

01:33:54
<transcript>: In the last couple of years, there's nothing wrong with elixir. It could handle the load. It's doing fine. We're not rewriting it for that reason. We're rewriting it because it takes me forever to make change in elixir. As you can see.

01:33:58
<transcript>: Stop explaining it. We have a thingy.

01:33:58
<transcript>: what's

01:34:01
neugestaltet: ohhh

01:34:01
<transcript>: What's a thingy. Oh, we have a command. Oh, you're right.

01:34:01
<transcript>: welcome to

01:34:02
thdxr: I need you to finish this

01:34:04
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Need Job coder.

01:34:04
<transcript>: i think

01:34:08
pbertrand_dev: !elixir

01:34:09
fossabot: Statmuse uses Elixir because an early engineer particularly enjoyed it. It's a great language and an intro to functional programming so you should check it out https://elixir-lang.org/

01:34:12
<transcript>: I think the command might answer your question, too. So. Okay, back to I need to finish it. Two. Dax, I need to finish it.

01:34:16
<transcript>: Set status. How do I do this.

01:34:21
<transcript>: I know there's a status thing.

01:34:23
<transcript>: No.

01:34:26
<transcript>: Set status code.

01:34:29
<transcript>: I do this.

01:34:29
thdxr: skip the status you freak

01:34:32
<transcript>: There's a function. Did I just see it.

01:34:34
<transcript>: On.

01:34:34
thdxr: you need to redo the whole frontend part of this

01:34:41
<transcript>: Put status put status.

01:34:45
thdxr: put_status

01:34:46
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:34:49
<transcript>: There's actually.

01:34:49
<transcript>: like

01:34:53
<transcript>: Like atoms for it. I don't know. I'm just going to do 303.

01:34:56
pbertrand_dev: as an indie builder I need my status codes to be correct so I can ship more accurately

01:35:02
<transcript>: Okay. So that's at least going to be more correct. Now let's go to the front end. Where's the front end.

01:35:07
<transcript>: Here.

01:35:09
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:35:09
bjufre: You're rewriting it to something else and not Elixir?

01:35:12
<transcript>: It's the.

01:35:17
<transcript>: It's this one which I'm going to now add.

01:35:19
thdxr: ^ yes to astro

01:35:22
thdxr: nothing to do with elixir

01:35:29
thdxr: now everyone shush so adam can make a little progress

01:35:30
<transcript>: Yes. Yes. Harpoon. Thank you, harpoon. Thank you, cowface. Thank you, prime. I want to thank everybody in the open source community for your contributions.

01:35:30
<transcript>: need to redo

01:35:34
<transcript>: Need to redo the whole front end part of this. Yeah, we're doing it. Skip the status.

01:35:34
<transcript>: i can't

01:35:43
<transcript>: I can't make it to React Miami. No matter how fast I fix this as an indie builder, I need my status codes to be correct, so I can ship more accurately exactly for trend. Exactly.

01:35:43
<transcript>: you're rerunning

01:35:51
<transcript>: You're rerunning it to something else and not elixir. Yeah, we're rewriting it to astro. Sorry, you already said that never been shash. I don't think of a rock.

01:36:00
thdxr: idc about react miami at this point I just need to see you go faster

01:36:02
<transcript>: Okay. Here we go. This is the form. It's already a form. Even I just need to not do this.

01:36:05
<transcript>: Email sign in link.

01:36:05
<transcript>: what

01:36:07
<transcript>: What.

01:36:11
<transcript>: Oh, it just runs this action.

01:36:11
<transcript>: other

01:36:15
<transcript>: Other client post subscribe so we can just post.

01:36:17
nexxeln: hello everyone

01:36:20
<transcript>: Subscribe. Just right here, just like form, action.

01:36:20
<transcript>: is that

01:36:22
<transcript>: Is that how this works.

01:36:22
<transcript>: how

01:36:25
<transcript>: How does the Web actually work.

01:36:28
<transcript>: So there's our form, action.

01:36:28
<transcript>: subscribe

01:36:32
<transcript>: Subscribe and it's just going to post the email field in the body as I.

01:36:32
<transcript>: works

01:36:34
<transcript>: Works.

01:36:34
<transcript>: nexus

01:36:36
<transcript>: Nexus here.

01:36:36
<transcript>: now everyone

01:36:40
bausmeier: You need method=POST too.

01:36:45
<transcript>: Now, everyone shush. So I don't care about recommending. At this point, I just need to see you go faster. Yeah. Dax, I need to go faster. Thank you. Honestly. From the bottom of my heart.

01:36:45
<transcript>: i

01:36:50
<transcript>: I need you to be on top of me so I can make this sustainable. It can't just be a good time.

01:36:50
<transcript>: i got to actually

01:36:59
<transcript>: I got to actually get stuff done while I'm on stream. Okay. Method post and then it's going to put the body. It's going to have the input. I think let's just try. Let's just see.

01:36:59
bjufre: @thdxr I will ask you then hahaha Is the FE gonna be done in Astro and then the backend in Elixir or how?

01:36:59
thdxr: I'm going to berate you into success

01:37:02
<transcript>: Let's just see.

01:37:02
thdxr: idiot

01:37:08
gitpush_gitpaid: someone clip that someone clip that now. "dax i need you on top of me"

01:37:08
<transcript>: You're going to parade me into success.

01:37:12
<transcript>: Okay. Here we go.

01:37:15
<transcript>: No, it failed. Why did it fail.

01:37:22
<transcript>: We searched everywhere. Can't say the page so it navigated to subscribe. Why would it do that.

01:37:25
seanbry22: Yo :)

01:37:27
<transcript>: Was that not a type submit button.

01:37:27
thdxr: @bjufre statmuse is made of a bunch of backend services written in various languages

01:37:30
<transcript>: Type submit what's from.

01:37:35
thdxr: the astro part will compose calls to them to render the frontend

01:37:35
<transcript>: Web Development Am I right.

01:37:41
<transcript>: Why would it be doing that? 404. I don't want to navigate. Why would it do that.

01:37:51
<transcript>: Someone clipped that. Someone clips that now. Dax, I need you on top of me. Did I say that? Oh, my goodness. Welcome, Sean bry. Welcome to Chat. Welcome, welcome.

01:37:54
nexxeln: my new hot take is that the current typescript orms are unnecessary abstractions and i can just write raw sql and assert types and typesafety is overrated

01:37:57
<transcript>: So the Astro part will compose calls. Okay, you guys need to stop talking about that stuff.

01:37:57
<transcript>: we need to

01:37:58
<transcript>: We need to talk about.

01:37:59
thdxr: I think I might be top 5 people in the world who understand the statmuse codebase

01:38:02
bausmeier: Does the API not have a prefix like /api?

01:38:05
<transcript>: The current timescape of our arms. No, I think I mean top ten that people understand. Sammy's coming.

01:38:05
<transcript>: dex i

01:38:07
<transcript>: Dex. I think you might be too.

01:38:11
bausmeier: The action needs to point to the endpoint.

01:38:12
<transcript>: Does it have a prefix like slashapi.

01:38:16
<transcript>: No.

01:38:16
<transcript>: oh

01:38:20
<transcript>: Oh, maybe, yeah, because I was using the client. Yay.

01:38:29
<transcript>: The client had that baked in, but I actually have to do it like that. I don't know if the client had other things. Let's see here.

01:38:31
<transcript>: Might be other things going on.

01:38:32
seanbry22: What switches are those god damn

01:38:32
thdxr: @nexxeln I mean prisma is unnecessary bloat for sure

01:38:37
<transcript>: In the client that we need to look at. Mothra client. Come on now.

01:38:37
thdxr: but I like Drizzle (obviously)

01:38:41
<transcript>: Cosmos. Mothra client.

01:38:48
nexxeln: i don't like drizzle at all lol

01:38:51
<transcript>: So is this all not going to work? Look at this. Xorigan. I got to add these headers. How do I do that in a traditional form? Post someone tell me.

01:38:51
thdxr: raw sql is hard to maintain

01:38:59
<transcript>: Did you guys stop talking about things that aren't what I'm doing, right this second.

01:39:02
<transcript>: Just kidding. Action needs to point to the endpoint.

01:39:04
nexxeln: okay adam

01:39:05
<transcript>: Sean bry, it's.

01:39:05
<transcript>: a mode

01:39:10
<transcript>: A mode 80 keyboard with mode signal switches, internal server error.

01:39:14
<transcript>: Internal server error. It's probably going to say.

01:39:17
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:39:17
kevinnaughtonjr: classic 500

01:39:22
nexxeln: !keyboard

01:39:22
fossabot: Adam uses a custom Mode Eighty mechanical keyboard, and has a collection of other Mode keyboards!

01:39:25
<transcript>: Probably going to say I didn't pass that stupid header. No function clause matching in. Oh, it tried to create the user.

01:39:28
<transcript>: Oh, we got a little further.

01:39:28
<transcript>: the reason

01:39:33
<transcript>: The reason it failed is that I'm not passing the auth stuff.

01:39:35
coolpantstv: I heard this streamer uses fake keyboard sounds

01:39:46
thdxr: having done the full spectrum of ORMs to raw sql kysely/drizzle is a good balance between not abstracting too much on op of sql and remaining maintainable

01:39:47
<transcript>: Classic 500. Kevin's, here. What's going. Kevin, I heard this streamer uses fake keyboard sounds. That would be dax. Dax does that. I've a real keyboard. I'm a real boy.

01:39:50
<transcript>: Oh, that's a good one? That's a good one.

01:39:59
<transcript>: Sometimes the dax sacks are actual facts. And this particular dax fact.

01:39:59
<transcript>: is

01:40:01
<transcript>: Is a real one.

01:40:07
<transcript>: Dax uses fake mechanical keyboard sounds. He doesn't even use mechanical keyboards.

01:40:07
<transcript>: it's

01:40:09
<transcript>: It's true.

01:40:15
laytanl_: :0

01:40:19
<transcript>: So how do I get all these headers onto a form submission? That's the next question. We got all these. These.

01:40:19
<transcript>: head

01:40:24
<transcript>: Headers. I got to do this. Paramount. What is this.

01:40:27
<transcript>: With credentials. I got to include that.

01:40:33
<transcript>: That cookie name, all of this stuff. How do I do this.

01:40:40
coolpantstv: Instead if drizzle just put all login in a stored procedure and call the SP in your code. EZ

01:40:40
gitpush_gitpaid: bro the production is insane. thats next level facts right there

01:40:43
<transcript>: With just a simple wait. Could I make it not an xhr request using this client somehow? Can I make it a request that would redirect someone tell me.

01:40:43
<transcript>: someone tell

01:40:44
<transcript>: Someone tell me.

01:40:44
<transcript>: or

01:40:45
i_pepper: !font

01:40:45
fossabot: Adam uses the Dracula theme with the Operator Mono font in Neovim.

01:40:53
<transcript>: Or do I need to just get the URL back to the client and then do like a navigate. Is that what I need to do? Is that best.

01:41:06
thdxr: Dax Fax

01:41:09
<transcript>: Get push, get paid. The production isn't saying that next level facts. Yeah, no. Some of the DAX facts are not actually facts, but I don't like to talk about it. Some of them are facts. And that one that I just gave you was true. It's a true fact about DAX.

01:41:13
<transcript>: Hi, Pepper, welcome to Chat? Welcome, welcome.

01:41:20
thdxr: I was gonna suggest you redirect from the frontend

01:41:21
<transcript>: Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. Dax, talk to me. I could just return the URL back to the client.

01:41:23
thdxr: by pulling out the url

01:41:28
thdxr: from the response

01:41:31
<transcript>: And then navigate using the url. Is that better than this form submission nonsense. I was going to suggest you redirect from the front end. Yeah, by pulling out the route. Perfect. I agree.

01:41:31
<transcript>: we went too

01:41:35
thdxr: yeah do that who cares about the platform

01:41:37
<transcript>: We went too far. We got a little overzealous. Let's just undo a lot of undo.

01:41:41
<transcript>: No redo, redo.

01:41:46
<transcript>: Undo. Okay. There we are. We're back to where we should be on this one.

01:41:51
<transcript>: Now this one right here is going to get the response.

01:41:54
thdxr: yeah remember when I was telling you NOT to do the 303

01:41:56
thdxr: I remember that

01:41:56
<transcript>: And then we're going to redirect.

01:41:56
<transcript>: right here

01:42:03
<transcript>: Right here. What was it doing? It's doing Redux stuff. Would you believe this code base? It's Redux.

01:42:03
<transcript>: can you

01:42:05
<transcript>: Can you believe it.

01:42:09
<transcript>: Email sign and link rejected, sure.

01:42:16
darkmast93: hey dad

01:42:17
<transcript>: Let's do that. But we're not going to do the positive case because right here we're going to say cons URL equals rest.

01:42:22
<transcript>: Let's see, let's just go and change the api first. Right.

01:42:22
<transcript>: where is it

01:42:26
thdxr: tbhI would just redirect from the frontend to the elixir backend which redirects again

01:42:28
<transcript>: Where is it? Right here. So this is when we're doing a redirect instead.

01:42:28
<transcript>: we're going to

01:42:29
l_mbert: Hi everyone

01:42:30
<transcript>: We're going to return.

01:42:35
thdxr: does not have to be a post

01:42:36
coolpantstv: Have you seen the brickmuse twitter account?

01:42:38
<transcript>: It url. Do I need json, something. It.

01:42:38
<transcript>: 's all

01:42:39
<transcript>: 's all.

01:42:39
<transcript>: do i need to

01:42:43
<transcript>: Do I need to wrap this in json? Yeah, we'll do like this.

01:42:43
<transcript>: yeah

01:42:44
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:42:48
<transcript>: We'll just say URL.

01:42:51
<transcript>: Is URL.

01:42:57
<transcript>: Okay.

01:43:02
<transcript>: Not actually redirecting code anymore.

01:43:06
<transcript>: Keyword argument must be followed by space. Is that not how you do it.

01:43:07
nexxeln: i def like kysely @thdxr

01:43:11
<transcript>: Sorry.

01:43:13
<transcript>: Okay.

01:43:13
<transcript>: i definitely like

01:43:21
<transcript>: I definitely like Kaisely. Have you seen the Brick muse Twitter account? I've seen a lot of the Twitter accounts. We call them the muse network.

01:43:21
<transcript>: lot

01:43:26
<transcript>: Lots of accounts on Twitter that post status, like things.

01:43:26
<transcript>: there's

01:43:29
<transcript>: There's a whole like discord where they all talk.

01:43:29
<transcript>: remember

01:43:33
<transcript>: Remember I was telling you not to do the 303.

01:43:35
<transcript>: Good callbacks.

01:43:35
<transcript>: good call

01:43:41
thdxr: I prefer the kysely query builder (for now) but having something complete matters more to me

01:43:44
<transcript>: Good call. See? Hey, dark mast. To be honest, I would readirect from the front end to the elixir backend. Which redirects again. Wait, what.

01:43:44
<transcript>: does that

01:43:47
<transcript>: Does that have to be a post.

01:43:50
<transcript>: I would just redirect from the front end.

01:43:50
<transcript>: to the

01:43:55
<transcript>: To the elixir back end, which redirects again.

01:43:58
<transcript>: Does not have to be a post that actually sounds better.

01:44:13
<transcript>: This will be a lot easier if you guys weren't intermixing all these conversations about other things, and you're just giving me to your undivided attention. So you're saying, instead, go back here, let's redirect just like we were.

01:44:16
<transcript>: And then instead of.

01:44:21
thdxr: this would be easier if you just gave me the keyboard

01:44:21
<transcript>: No.

01:44:25
<transcript>: Did I lose it.

01:44:25
<transcript>: no

01:44:28
coolpantstv: sorry, no more conversation after this line please -----------------------------------

01:44:30
<transcript>: No. So here we're still redirecting. You're saying you would redirect from the front end.

01:44:30
<transcript>: this would be

01:44:39
<transcript>: This would be easier if you just gave me the keyboard. It really would. I think I understand now. Sorry. No more conversation at this line.

01:44:41
<transcript>: So back here.

01:44:43
thdxr: can statmuse pay me by the hour to pair program with you on stream

01:44:45
<transcript>: Instead of doing this, we're going to do, like.

01:44:51
<transcript>: Window? Navigate? What is it? Window location.

01:44:51
<transcript>: reader

01:44:55
<transcript>: Readerct is there a redirect in JavaScript.

01:44:58
nexxeln: brb

01:44:59
<transcript>: Sammy's, pay me by the hour to pair program with you on stream.

01:45:04
<transcript>: I was thinking, just like our friendship decks. Was like that was the payment.

01:45:04
<transcript>: because

01:45:05
<transcript>: Because.

01:45:05
<transcript>: we get

01:45:10
coolpantstv: I think I deserve some compensation for this too.

01:45:10
<transcript>: We get friendship out of it. I don't know. That was kind of what I thought was working out here.

01:45:13
l_mbert: window.location.href = "xxx"

01:45:16
<transcript>: How do I just. Okay. Am I actually about to Google JavaScript.

01:45:16
<transcript>: browse

01:45:22
<transcript>: Browser redirect. I can't believe I'm doing this right now. How to redirect to another web page.

01:45:28
<transcript>: When it's not simply redirect window location replace. Is that better.

01:45:29
thdxr: the only point of having friends is to extract money from them

01:45:37
<transcript>: Server page is redirect. Similar behaviors clicking on a link. Okay, we want to redirect so just that.

01:45:43
<transcript>: The only point of having friends is to extract money out of them. That's funny.

01:45:46
<transcript>: Do I need to do it like this.

01:45:48
<transcript>: No.

01:45:54
thdxr: location.href ="/adam/have/you/done/web/dev/before"

01:45:55
<transcript>: How does this work.

01:46:03
mecoupz: replace removes the history

01:46:04
<transcript>: So do I need to await it. Or just like that. Dax, does this work.

01:46:13
<transcript>: Have you done what before? The only point of having window location dot href equals xxx. Yes.

01:46:13
<transcript>: i'm

01:46:16
coolpantstv: Needs to be the text on this photo @thdxr https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FtW8iyxWIAMVI3b?format=jpg&name=medium

01:46:18
thdxr: yeah take it out of the try catch

01:46:19
<transcript>: I'm aware I could do that, or I could use replace. But do I just put the promise in there.

01:46:20
darkmast93: Can I have stackoverflow link?

01:46:23
darkmast93: that was open

01:46:26
<transcript>: Needs to be the text on this photo. Take it out of the try catch.

01:46:27
kevinnaughtonjr: i am literally in a movie rn

01:46:30
thdxr: no promise

01:46:30
<transcript>: Like that.

01:46:35
<transcript>: You are literally in a movie right now. Kevin, what movie.

01:46:35
<transcript>: what movie

01:46:37
<transcript>: What movie are you in.

01:46:37
l_mbert: It's just a stirng

01:46:37
thdxr: wtf adam did you suffer a brain injury

01:46:39
thdxr: I know you know this

01:46:41
<transcript>: No promise? What's? No promise.

01:46:48
<transcript>: I know. You know this. Did you suffer a brain injury? Sometimes I wonder it's just a string? What's? Just a string.

01:46:50
thdxr: wtf is motrhaclient

01:46:51
kevinnaughtonjr: idk but it's something with absurdly high production quality i wanna know more about your setup omg

01:46:52
<transcript>: What are you talking about? What's this? A string.

01:46:56
<transcript>: Mother client is necessary. Okay, listen.

pbertrand_dev: adams mind right now : EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

01:47:03
<transcript>: After client adds all kinds of headers and stuff I have to call with monster client.

01:47:05
thdxr: `location.href = mothraurl + "/subscribe"`

01:47:14
<transcript>: Okay. I have to. I think I see the problem here. You guys think I can just pass the I can just navigate toAPI subscribe. I can't.

01:47:14
<transcript>: can i

01:47:16
<transcript>: Can I I can't.

01:47:16
<transcript>: look

01:47:17
<transcript>: Look.

01:47:25
<transcript>: My three url plus subscribe. No. Look, Mothra client. If you guys can tell me how I can replicate this.

01:47:25
<transcript>: i have to

01:47:28
thdxr: if mothra client can't accept a normal GET then you can't do this

01:47:29
<transcript>: I have to have all these headers. Okay, I have to.

01:47:29
<transcript>: and i have to

01:47:33
<transcript>: And I have to pass credentials. How do I do that with a redirect.

01:47:33
<transcript>: i don't think

01:47:37
thdxr: go back to the POST req

01:47:41
<transcript>: I don't think I do. I think that's a problem. If it can't accept a normal git, then you can't do this. Yeah. No, I can't. Okay. Got it.

01:47:43
<transcript>: Got it.

01:47:43
<transcript>: go back

01:47:45
<transcript>: Go back here.

01:47:48
thdxr: cookies will be there

01:47:50
<transcript>: Undo it. So we're going to go back to the just do it from the client thing.

01:47:53
thdxr: but idk about the csrf token

01:47:55
<transcript>: So here we're going to just say window.

01:47:58
<transcript>: Location.

01:48:00
thdxr: but you don't need a csrf token on redirect

01:48:07
<transcript>: Href equals rest URL just like that. And then we're going to return. Let's see, let's go back here.

01:48:11
<transcript>: Here. We're going to say.

01:48:14
<transcript>: Can I just do this.

01:48:17
<transcript>: Json.

01:48:18
<transcript>: Url.

01:48:29
<transcript>: I think we were just all on the wrong page. We were all on different pages.

01:48:29
<transcript>: simple

01:48:35
l_mbert: Wouldn't the redirect just redirect the post request?

01:48:35
<transcript>: Simple explanation. I've not had a brain injury. Cookies will be there. I don't know about the.

01:48:35
<transcript>: csr

01:48:41
<transcript>: Csrf token. Yeah, you don't need a csrf token on redirect. Wait, seriously.

01:48:44
thdxr: everyone shut up no one can talk except me

01:48:46
<transcript>: Wouldn't the redirect just redirect the post request.

01:48:49
l_mbert: Okay :(

01:48:50
<transcript>: Everyone said no one can talk except me. Just axe.

01:48:57
<transcript>: Go back to the post request.

01:48:59
coolpantstv: ...

lilfreezi: do u just wake up this handsome or do you put some work in to it

01:49:54

01:50:23
namechangecoming: Off topic question but does StatMuse any functionality for Daily fantasy Sports and keywords are best to use in the search if so?

<transcript>: Did it actually call.

01:54:28
<transcript>: no it

01:54:35

neugestaltet: BibleThump <3

01:59:50
thdxr: wouldn't you be happier if you actually got this work done

01:59:56
<transcript>: Things like societal collapse and other external factors that could just ruin it all. Something could happen to one of us. I love my family so much. They're the best I got the two best little boys in the world. I mean, they're a nightmare sometimes, but they're the best.

02:00:00

l_mbert: @vapor__dev Same lol

02:00:08

02:00:13
coolpantstv: I think your money is complicating your life, just give it to me and you will be happier :)

02:00:17
vapor__dev: “External factor that could ruin it all” — thxdr enters the chat…

02:00:25
thdxr: idk seems like your wife doesn't like you

02:00:26
<transcript>: And we live in our dream home, in our dream neighborhood. And just, like, everything about life is good. I don't know. Why don't I start saying that? Oh, yeah. Because then I had this existential dread of, like, it can't last. I know, like, my entire life cannot just from henceforth be perfect.

02:00:28
<transcript>: It can't.

02:00:28
<transcript>: and then

02:00:31
pbertrand_dev: yeah being close with your wife is always a good thing

02:00:39
<transcript>: And then I just start thinking about that that's the only negative thoughts ever have are, like, what's going to happen, that it's going to come crumbling down or, like, not even crumbling down. That's dramatic what's going to happen.

02:00:39
<transcript>: where it's like

02:00:41
gitpush_gitpaid: adam: "everyone be quiet i need to get work done"..... also adam: "yea im rich and have a great life let me tell you about it"

02:00:44
<transcript>: Where it's like man. Remember when life was so good for that two, three year stretch.

02:00:44
<transcript>: and then

02:00:46
<transcript>: And then reality happened.

02:00:46
<transcript>: something

02:00:47
nexxeln: https://twitter.com/nexxeln/status/1648262236803313669

<transcript>: Something awful happened. I don't know.

02:00:49
<transcript>: i don't want to

02:00:54
<transcript>: I don't want to spend time there, just like thinking about what could go wrong, but at the same time.

02:01:00
<transcript>: I don't think it can go on forever. Okay. Anyway.

02:01:09
<transcript>: Dax enters the chat. Seems like your wife doesn't like you. My eyes loves me. Stop it. She doesn't like me sometimes. But she loves me. Wjt.

thdxr: my wife ALWAYS likes me

02:01:37
<transcript>: Kevin was here. Oh, Kevin, you are still here. So I was thinking about YouTube. Kevin, you've done really well on YouTube. And I'd like to know from you, Kevin, I'm at the very beginning of thinking, like, I'm might go hard on YouTube.

02:01:37
<transcript>: i've been kind of

02:01:42
<transcript>: I've been kind of at that beginning for weeks, months, maybe.

02:01:42
<transcript>: where it's like

02:02:02
<transcript>: Where it's like that might be the next thing I might just get obsessed with YouTube and go down that rabbit hole. But then I start wondering maybe I shouldn't. Maybe I met Pete happiness, and I should just leave well enough alone. And I won't gain anything from getting obsessed with YouTube for some period of time. Do you have any advice, Kevin? Do you think I will wish I had or hadn't gone down the path.

02:02:07
<transcript>: I'm curious what your thoughts are. I just saw a YouTube video last night.

02:02:07
<transcript>: from

02:02:18
<transcript>: From a guy named dorian. I want to say dorian develops. It just was on the top of my feed. I'd never heard of dorian. I've now connected with him on Twitter.

02:02:18
<transcript>: it was like

02:02:21
<transcript>: It was like this whole long rant. He went on about.

02:02:24
<transcript>: Just like.

02:02:24
<transcript>: kind of

02:02:26
<transcript>: Kind of his YouTube.

02:02:37
<transcript>: Path where he got hooked into YouTube, and why and how he left everything left his job to do YouTube full time. But the bigger, broader message in the YouTube video was.

02:02:37
<transcript>: like he

02:02:43
kevinnaughtonjr: i'd say give it a try if it's something that interests you! can always stop if you don't love it. i've found it to be really fun and fulfilling, but can also be stressful at times

02:02:47
<transcript>: Like he spent his whole career trying to retire early and trying get that thing that would just like, make it where he could retire early, spend more time with his family, but ultimately.

02:02:47
<transcript>: what

02:02:49
<transcript>: What is he doing.

02:02:49
<transcript>: if he

02:02:49
kevinnaughtonjr: Dorian is awesome i love his channel :)

02:02:55
<transcript>: If he's not enjoying his kids now because this is the time when they really want to be with him.

02:02:55
<transcript>: and that's all

02:02:57
<transcript>: And that's all thoughts. I've had so much.

02:03:00
<transcript>: And that's where I just started thinking, like.

02:03:01
thdxr: he's just trying to trick people into not doing youtube so he doesn't have competition

02:03:13
kevinnaughtonjr: shhhh don't let him know my strategy dax

02:03:20
<transcript>: Why am I wanting to do YouTube? I don't know exactly. I don't know what I'm lacking in life, Kevin replied. I'd say, Give it a try. Something that interests you. You can always stop if you don't love. It found to be really fun and fulfilling, but can also be stressful at times. Okay, well, so it sounds like most work, I guess. In that sense, it's no different than.

02:03:20
<transcript>: don't let them

02:03:22
<transcript>: Don't let them know my strategy.

02:03:22
<transcript>: he's just trying

02:03:26
imshootex: we're lacking in life if you don't do youtube :)

02:03:27
<transcript>: He's just trying to trick people. It's not doing YouTube. So it doesn't have competition.

02:03:29
<transcript>: No.

02:03:29
<transcript>: i think

02:03:40
<transcript>: I think the YouTube crowd, like the developers on YouTube, are also just a group that I'm not that close with yet. Like Kevin, people like Kevin and dorian, who I'm just discovering there's so many of those people that I discover all the time.

02:03:48
pbertrand_dev: The good thing about twitch is when you say something stupid its not there anymore. On youtube its there forever

02:03:52
<transcript>: And joining twitch and starting to stream. I just sort of like, met all these people that do twitch and hang out in twitch chat. And that's been so fulfilling. So I kind of think, like, YouTube could be that, too. It's a whole new community.

02:03:52
<transcript>: but then

02:03:54
<transcript>: But then.

02:03:56
thdxr: nah we clip

02:03:58
kevinnaughtonjr: i'd suggest trying to make a video  a week or so for x weeks. consistency is super important on youtube i find

02:03:59
<transcript>: I don't want to add more to my plate and then regret it at some point.

02:03:59
<transcript>: but it sounds like

02:04:04
gitpush_gitpaid: here me out... youtube channel where you take the most common statmuse record queries and try to break them "adam throws the longest nfl pass"

02:04:08
pbertrand_dev: LUL

02:04:09
gitpush_gitpaid: hear*

02:04:17
thdxr: @gitpush_gitpaid LOL

02:04:18
kevinnaughtonjr: yeah work is work. i'm happy to chat about it off stream more too if that's helpful for you :)

02:04:19
<transcript>: But it sounds like, Kevin, your take is like it's just like everything else. It's just like, work. It's it can be really fun and fulfilling. And there can be parts of your stressful. Is that accurate? I was trying to make a video a week or so for six weeks. Consistency is super important on YouTube. Yeah. So I've made a few videos, not consistently. And I know if I'm going to really do it.

02:04:19
<transcript>: it's

02:04:29
<transcript>: It's got to be a thing I'm consistently doing. I have a problem with you can tell from the stream, like with production quality and spending a lot of time on stuff that's just not important.

02:04:35
thechosenone1080: its friday then its saturday sunday

02:04:40
<transcript>: Okay. All. Great advice. Thank you so much, Kevin. Work is work. I'm happy to chat about allstream. Yeah, I would love to, actually, I'd just love to connect with you more, Kevin. I mean, we've interacted a bit here.

02:04:40
<transcript>: checked on twitter

02:04:51
<transcript>: Checked on Twitter, but I'd love to talk with you more just because I like doing that. I like getting on Zoom calls with other folks in the community. Okay. Zycon Sri Dec.

02:04:51
<transcript>: decraft

02:04:51
<transcript>: decraft work thank

02:04:56
kevinnaughtonjr: same here! shoot me a dm on twitter or something and we can set up some time!

02:04:59
<transcript>: Decraft work. Thank you for the follows joke. Did I see that one earlier? You guys have a string of tough names to say. I will say.

02:04:59
<transcript>: those were not

02:05:03
<transcript>: Those were not the easiest. If you guys could just like, organize.

02:05:03
<transcript>: and

02:05:08
<transcript>: And sort by easier to say names mix in hard one every once in a while.

02:05:08
<transcript>: yeah

02:05:10
<transcript>: Yeah, we'll do. Kevin. I'll shoot you to.

02:05:12
lilfreezi: ZOOM and not discord??? 🤢

02:05:12
<transcript>: Be fun.

02:05:12
<transcript>: okay

02:05:15
<transcript>: Okay. Dax, did you wrap up your.

02:05:15
<transcript>: react

02:05:26
<transcript>: React Miami Talk or what? Get push, get paid, turk, hear me out YouTube channel where you take the most common Satmus record queries and try to break them. Adam throws the longest NFL path.

02:05:30
thdxr: no I'm wasting time here

02:05:37
gitpush_gitpaid: @gitpush_gitpaid i mean that would be pretty dope

02:05:42
<transcript>: That's funny. Did you know turk? Actually, I can throw football pretty far. I was a high school quarterback award winning. Even it was all Southwest Missouri high school quarterback. So I can throw a football. Okay. I can also pitch a baseball.

02:05:43
matty_twoshoes: i don't think i'd have much to talk about with you adam LUL so i haven't DMd you

02:05:54
tsoutsou_proutsou: How is going?

02:05:57
<transcript>: What else did I miss when I was just rambling? The good thing about twitch is when you say something stupid, it's not there anymore on YouTube. It's there forever. Yeah, exactly. This is honestly, twitch is the lowest effort content you can make. I think dax, you said that. Maybe.

02:05:57
<transcript>: it really genuinely

02:06:02
<transcript>: It really, genuinely is. You just turn on a camera. I mean, I've put a lot of effort into it, but.

02:06:02
<transcript>: you literally can just turn

02:06:03
thdxr: "Southwest missouri" that's like a thousand people right

02:06:06
<transcript>: You literally can just turn on a camera and do no prep and just hang out.

02:06:06
<transcript>: and that's

02:06:12
coolpantstv: "I have all the money", "perfect life", "everyone loves me", "award winning highschool athlete"

02:06:12
<transcript>: And that's streaming it's content. It's probably the only reason I do it. It's low effort.

02:06:12
<transcript>: like

02:06:15
<transcript>: Like most other content, seems so high effort.

02:06:18
gitpush_gitpaid: "lowest effort content"..... also struggles to code on twitch

02:06:28
<transcript>: He's just trying to trick people. Already read that one. Did I miss anything else? My wife always likes me. Okay, there's never a moment. Dax, where Liz is like daxy. Drive me crazy. Nothing like that. Is that unique to my marriage.

02:06:29
vapor__dev: and people write code for you!

02:06:29
thdxr: @CoolpantsTV he's just compensating for spending 2 hours on one redirect

02:06:34
<transcript>: I'm wasting time here. I mean, that would be pretty dope.

02:06:41
jeroenreumkens: Really funny to hear. Twitch to me seems like to next step after YouTube actually.

02:06:42
<transcript>: I don't think I'd have much to talk about with you, Adam. So I haven't dm'd you. That's all right. Not everybody does. Not everybody has much to talk about.

02:06:42
<transcript>: suitsu's here

02:06:48
<transcript>: Suitsu's. Here. How are you doing? Tutu, South Missouri. That's, like, 1000 people, right? Okay.

02:06:48
<transcript>: d

02:06:52
<transcript>: Dax saffle Missouri is a large region.

02:06:52
<transcript>: with lots of high

02:06:54
<transcript>: With lots of high schools. Okay.

02:06:59
thdxr: if you DM adam he's gonna ignore it just FYI

02:06:59
nexxeln: https://twitter.com/nexxeln/status/1648326989819056133

02:07:01
<transcript>: Don't diminish, belittle. Don't diminish my accomplishments. Dax.

02:07:07
<transcript>: That's funny. I have all the money. Perfect. Everyone loves me. Award winning high school athlete. Sorry. Cool pants. Yeah. Is that how I come off.

02:07:07
<transcript>: it's just common

02:07:10
<transcript>: It's just common things for sending 2 hours.

02:07:11
thechosenone1080: @thdxr has a open source marriage and its well documented @adamdotdev

02:07:17
<transcript>: That was a good one, dex. You got me. You got me with that one.

02:07:18
thdxr: ^^^

02:07:19
<transcript>: I don't always laugh, but sometimes.

02:07:19
<transcript>: you get

02:07:23
<transcript>: You get me and people write code for me. I know.

02:07:29
<transcript>: Also struggles to code on Question, yeah, it's hard to code on twitch. I don't know.

02:07:32
<transcript>: Welcome to chat.

02:07:32
<transcript>: jerry

02:07:36
<transcript>: Jerry own really funny here twitch to me. Seems like next up after YouTube.

02:07:36
<transcript>: really

02:07:36
thdxr: "diminish" wow big word for someone from Missouri

02:07:39
<transcript>: Really, you don't have to plan for Twitch.

02:07:39
<transcript>: i'm doing

02:07:44
<transcript>: I'm doing what I would be doing anyway. Mostly working. Except I'd probably be getting stuff done.

02:07:44
<transcript>: you just

02:07:45
pbertrand_dev: Do you find it easier to code redirects offstream or onstream?

02:07:47
vapor__dev: ageeeeen

02:07:48
<transcript>: You just get to hang out with people while you do it. So it's pretty great.

02:07:48
<transcript>: if you

02:07:52
thdxr: the more you read chat the meaner I'm gonna be

02:07:53
thdxr: so you focus

02:07:53
nexxeln: is missouri a meme state?

02:07:54
<transcript>: If you DM Adam, he's just going to ignore it. Fyi okay. So I will say if you've dm'd me and I have not responded.

02:07:57
<transcript>: This is not a unique experience for you.

02:07:57
<transcript>: i am

02:08:00
thdxr: no it's not relevant enough to be

02:08:04
<transcript>: I am terrible with my DMs. That's not like I'm not trying to puff myself up like I get so many DMs. I don't get that many DMs.

02:08:04
<transcript>: but

02:08:07
<transcript>: But I don't read them. Hardly ever.

02:08:07
<transcript>: i don't know

02:08:22
thdxr: I need to cause adam pain when he reads chat so he makes an association

02:08:27
<transcript>: I don't know why. I think you know what it is. If every app that had dms on it allowed you to Mark as unread, I would read them, but I know if I click on it, I have to deal with it right now or I will never remember again. So I just don't click on it. So they're just all unread. Discord Twitter, all of the place, all my dms on red. I'm so sorry if you've Dm'me and I have not.

02:08:27
<transcript>: read them

02:08:38
nexxeln: adam replied to my dm CoolCat

02:08:40
<transcript>: Read them. It's because I don't have the mental energy to deal with it right that moment. And if I don't have the minimal energy to deal with it right at that moment, I have to wait and not open it. So I haven't even read it. It's not that I read it and ignored it. I just haven't even read it.

02:08:40
<transcript>: and

02:08:48
<transcript>: And maybe to some people having, like, 15 unread messages on every single platform would make you stressed. It doesn't for me. I don't know.

02:08:48
<transcript>: a glance right

02:08:53
<transcript>: A glance right past it. It's a thing I know eventually I'll get to.

02:08:53
<transcript>: okay

02:08:54
gitpush_gitpaid: alright bro enough with the excuses back to code what is this im trying to replicate statmuse

02:08:58
<transcript>: Okay. Dax has an open source marriage. It's well documented.

02:08:58
<transcript>: big word

02:09:13
<transcript>: Big word for some of them is very ouch. Do you find it easier to code redirects offstream or on stream way? Easier off stream. I had to think about that one actually way easier. Austria I can do everything in code way. Easier when I'm not streaming because I actually focus more you reach out the meaner I'm going to be okay.

02:09:15
<transcript>: Here we go.

02:09:15
nexxeln: adam you might like texts.com

02:09:18
<transcript>: Focus.

02:09:18
<transcript>: what do we try

02:09:20
<transcript>: What do we try last.

02:09:20
<transcript>: oh i was getting ready

02:09:24
<transcript>: Oh, I was getting ready to do something in this file that I didn't move away.

02:09:24
<transcript>: this function

02:09:25
<transcript>: This function.

02:09:27
<transcript>: Does not work.

02:09:31
<transcript>: Does not work. We're passing in a connection, and then.

02:09:31
<transcript>: email

02:09:33
<transcript>: Email.

02:09:38
l_mbert: Can I book you dax so I can finally finish stuff?

02:09:40
thdxr: no one has an invite to texts.com

02:09:41
thdxr: it's not real

02:09:42
<transcript>: An email that looks good. Is that good? Dax, elixir, People. Does that match.

02:09:42
<transcript>: it

02:09:45
<transcript>: It said, what did it say? It said it doesn't exist.

02:09:46
thdxr: @l_mbert yes

02:09:46
mecoupz: @nexxeln that is a bigger scam than adam's macbook thing

02:09:50
<transcript>: No function clause matching session control. Two.

02:09:57
mecoupz: THINGS ARE NOT PRIVATE WHEN YOU HAVE GOOGLE LOGIN. period.

02:09:57
<transcript>: Session controller. Oh, no, that's the one. Yeah, that's it.

02:10:00
<transcript>: Session controllers create.

02:10:02
<transcript>: Two.

02:10:02
<transcript>: right

02:10:04
<transcript>: Right.

02:10:07
<transcript>: Connection and email. What am I missing? Here.

02:10:14
<transcript>: I would love text. I've never gotten an invite. I would love it.

02:10:14
<transcript>: back

02:10:16
<transcript>: Back to code. Yes.

02:10:16
<transcript>: you're trying to replicate

02:10:25
nexxeln: loll

02:10:26
lrnzdc3696: slow?

02:10:32
thdxr: the email pattern match probably isn't working because it's now in a query param

02:10:34
<transcript>: You're trying to replicate sammy's. Next I replied to your DM. So sometimes I do reply to dms. If I get enough of the preview that I understand what the DM is and I can quickly reply. I do so it's not everybody, but it's not like because it's you. I don't not read it in because it's you. It's because I think I might have to do something with that DM.

02:10:40
<transcript>: Okay. Is Missouri a meme state? Yeah, probably not real enough. No. Okay. I gotta stop reading.

02:10:45
<transcript>: Things are not private when you have Google login period.

02:10:48
achour2011: why elixir for backend why not nodejs

02:10:52
<transcript>: Can someone tell me the email pattern match probably isn't working because it's now in a query. Pram.

02:10:52
<transcript>: ah that

02:11:00
<transcript>: Ah, that's what it is. That's what it is. It's exactly right, dax. How do I get the query params? How do I get the query params.

02:11:07
<transcript>: Con query I don't like it any type ahead or anything. Let's just go to Google.

02:11:40
<transcript>: Why elixir for back end, and why not know jess. Great question. There you go.

02:11:45
<transcript>: How to get current request url full query params.

02:11:45
<transcript>: what

02:11:48
<transcript>: What do I mean? Full query brands.

02:11:53
<transcript>: Con assigns params.

02:11:56
<transcript>: Fetch, query, params.

02:12:00
<transcript>: This triggers parsley that they haven't parsed yet.

02:12:00
<transcript>: just

02:12:06
mecoupz: dax how many adam bucks do you have?

02:12:09
<transcript>: Just do Cond query params as a map. Cool as a map. So this one no.

02:12:09
<transcript>: wait

02:12:10
<transcript>: Wait.

02:12:13
thdxr: only 364

02:12:17
<transcript>: Why did this subscribe even match if there's no email? Let's just do this. Let's just do.

02:12:22
<transcript>: I o. Put email.

02:12:22
<transcript>: oh yeah

02:12:26
<transcript>: Oh, yeah? I want to do what you said. Iot outputs.

02:12:26
<transcript>: email

02:12:28
mecoupz: 364k? nice

02:12:30
<transcript>: Email. Yeah. Let's do this.

02:12:32

02:12:54
<transcript>: Omg. P. Bertrand Has won a MacBook.

02:13:00
<transcript>: Okay, let's try this.

02:13:04
<transcript>: What's funny is.

02:13:13
<transcript>: What's funny is it would be working if I just re logged in. We got that case working. Oh, it's got the email, dax. No, it's got the email. That's not the problem.

02:13:15
<transcript>: That's not the problem.

02:13:17
achour2011: are you the only person working in this project :o ?  are even making money from million of users LUL

02:13:20
<transcript>: So the email is working.

02:13:20
<transcript>: the problem

02:13:23
<transcript>: The problem is what.

02:13:25
<transcript>: Problem is.

02:13:30
<transcript>: Apisession controller create.

02:13:38
<transcript>: Is that map? Correct? What I'm passing in there? Is that correct.

02:13:41
thdxr: can you actually look at the stacktrace for once

02:13:42
<transcript>: Is that correct? Right there.

02:13:46
thdxr: and look at the line number

02:13:46
<transcript>: Email Email look at the stack trace for once.

02:13:48
<transcript>: I guess.

02:13:53
<transcript>: Motor web. Create two.

02:13:58
<transcript>: So let's pass in the connection in there. But then.

02:13:58
<transcript>: it truncates

02:14:04
<transcript>: It truncates. And I don't get to see. Oh, there it is. Email. Yeah, see, it's working. We're passing in the email.

02:14:14
<transcript>: Look at the line number. I know what line number this is on. I know where this code is. Session Controller 58.

02:14:16
thdxr: you probably need to pass a map with string keys

02:14:17
<transcript>: Yeah, sure.

02:14:24
<transcript>: I know where that is. It's right here. No, I don't. Where is it? Oh, jeez. Oh, wow. Way down here.

02:14:24
<transcript>: so

02:14:29
<transcript>: So that's what. Oh, that's just where the error is rendered. Probably need to pass a map with string keys.

02:14:33
<transcript>: Oh, yeah? I'm matching on? Look what I'm matching on.

02:14:36
thdxr: yeah so that is a pattern with string keys

02:14:38
<transcript>: And then here it's.

02:14:38
<transcript>: oh

02:14:41
<transcript>: Oh, is that an atom.

02:14:43
<transcript>: That's the problem.

02:14:43
<transcript>: that's the problem

02:14:44
<transcript>: That's the problem.

02:14:46
thdxr: remember that old tip

02:14:50
thdxr: atom keys and string keys are not the same

02:14:53
<transcript>: So that is the pattern with string keys. Remember that old tip? Oh, yeah, strings are not atoms. Got it.

02:14:55
thdxr: no it's still in atom

02:14:56
thdxr: lmfao

02:15:00
<transcript>: You think I'll get that eventually, but then we're just going to stop doing elixir. And I'm definitely not going to get it.

02:15:00
<transcript>: okay

02:17:33
thdxr: alan has seen how frustrated I get when people type the wrong thing into an editor

02:17:36
vapor__dev: *wipes blood off fist* "i'm not mad at all"

02:17:44
<transcript>: We don't want to do that. I need to create a second method again. This whole code base is going away, literally the entire code base. So like when I do stuff like create a new function and call it create two. Just ignore me, okay? Just like, don't don't mind me. Create.

02:18:42
thdxr: you know what would be good content? if I murdered adam

02:18:48
<transcript>: Just do this. Find or register by email. Do I need to do all this stuff? Add new user contact. I don't think I need to do all that stuff.

02:18:52
adjectiveallison: I'd pay for it

02:18:53
<transcript>: Because we're going to just find them by the email address anyway. So let's do this.

02:18:56
<transcript>: I do need the user though.

02:18:56
<transcript>: let's see

02:18:58
<transcript>: Let's see, where are we doing.

02:18:58
gitpush_gitpaid: bro just imagine millions of gamblers are relying on code written on live stream on another website by someone getting help someone else in a chat box that has max amount of characters at a time

02:19:03
<transcript>: It's right here. Instead of this, we're going to do user equals.

02:19:06
<transcript>: Like that.

02:19:08
thdxr: hahaha

02:19:09
pbertrand_dev: @thdxr no longer allowed by the Rust foundation TOS

02:19:10

02:19:19
matty_twoshoes: @thdxr make it a subathon where the more people sub then the longer you keep adam alive (kidding)

02:19:20
<transcript>: visitor

02:19:22
<transcript>: Visitor.

02:19:22
<transcript>: instead

02:19:25
<transcript>: Instead of that code, I'm going to run this code.

02:19:27
<transcript>: And then.

02:19:27
<transcript>: that should work

02:19:33
<transcript>: That should work. We find a register. Yeah. So now let's go back here and let's delete this.

02:19:37
<transcript>: So create.

02:19:39
<transcript>: Email.

02:19:40
thdxr: ^ great idea

02:26:29
thdxr: @nexxeln also FIU

<transcript>: What? I posted a picture of my house and got into a conversation with somebody from California about my house because I just built it and we ended up talking about construction costs, and I was open with them. I just let them know how much it costs, and they freaked out.

02:26:56
thdxr: Adam's house and my NYC apartment are the same price roughly and his house is 100x nicer

02:27:08
<transcript>: Like to think that you could have a house. That's nice for that kind of money compared to what they can get in California. Thank you for the follow fear. I don't think I saw that one. Well, what happened here? No, folks do we inspect the thing. Do we get the user? Yeah. Here we go. Info. User. Oh, it's got an okay on it.

thdxr: build me a 3 bedroom house on your second lot and I'll come stay there for 3 months out of the year

02:32:01
<transcript>: And then basically, I have friends all over the place. And if somehow all the people that are friends with me that I care about could just live right next to me, then my life would be literally perfect.

<transcript>: My wife. It's not the blog post I wanted to write today, but it's the one I needed to write. I hope this will further shed some light on the issues. Why are we breaking the Use query api on purpose? I'm not going to read the whole blog post right now, but somebody want to give me like a tldr.

02:32:31
gitpush_gitpaid: bro i dont even need a house. let me stay in the sauna when you dont use it and ill move.

02:32:31
thdxr: I'm sure your wife is gonna love that pitch

cowfacedev: https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen/status/1648294393474891777?s=20

<transcript>: Discusses the challenges of designing apis for library interfaces, and announces a removal of callbacks on Use Query and rack query Five. The author explains that major version bumps are often about correcting past design decisions, and that getting api design right the first time is difficult. They argue that the current Use query callbacks are not consistent, can cause bugs and encourage anti patterns. This is such.

02:34:23
<transcript>: a good

02:34:25

cosmiclasagna: wow that worked

02:34:37
<transcript>: Recycle remove on success on air and unsettled callbacks from use query as they have been deemed a bad api. The author demonstrates drawbacks using these.

02:34:43
hyeheal: I dont like this change

02:34:46
<transcript>: Cool. Overall, api should be simple, intuitive, and consistent. The removal of the Use query callbacks aimed to prevent bug front scenarios and encourage better practices. Many makes sense.

02:34:46
<transcript>: i'm

02:34:48
<transcript>: I'm convinced.

02:34:50

02:35:31
<transcript>: moving on

02:35:32
<transcript>: Moving on.

02:35:34
seanbry22: I dont like that change either - You can get a lot of useful usecases for them callbacks. We use them all over at cal

02:35:52
<transcript>: In my opinion THEO'S case what happened? I think testing is important and can solve big problems when done right. Just FYI my opinion deals case when a case not writing tests makes sense. Early stage startup building an app which isn't extremely technically challenging. First priority should be shipping, but that's not scenario. Most developers face a certain size complexity. There are no tests. That means it doesn't work manually. Test.

02:35:52
<transcript>: testing stuff

02:36:02
<transcript>: Testing stuff only works up to a point 100% agree this is the nuance that's lost when the thought leader aka person or people follow and listen to posts the Vin diagram that pour their absence reality of most developers.

02:36:02
<transcript>: stand

02:36:10
<transcript>: Stand behind that diagram. Ooh, it's getting spicy. Theo. See us here. The majority of failures can't be tested, and the majority of things you can test are useless.

02:36:10
<transcript>: makes your role

02:36:17
<transcript>: Makes your role of showing what can be tested. Plus what good tests look like. That much more valuable, in my opinion.

02:36:17
<transcript>: i agree

02:36:25
<transcript>: I agree with everything, but this. The majority of failures can't be tested, but I'm okay. Drew with you on this. Okay? Seems civil. Seems fun.

02:36:25
<transcript>: i don't know why

02:36:31
<transcript>: I don't know why I said fun. This is a good conversation. I have no input. Does anyone have input? I have nothing.

02:36:31
<transcript>: i don't

02:36:33
<transcript>: I don't write test much.

02:36:33
<transcript>: i also do

02:36:35
thdxr: I do write tests but they lag months behind the feature being shipped

02:36:39
<transcript>: I also do a lot of what they're describing here, which is building early stage startups.

02:36:39
<transcript>: do

02:36:43

02:36:47
thdxr: because the feature might get thrown away, reworked, etc

02:36:47

02:37:05

02:37:05
<transcript>: the proportion of

02:37:16
<transcript>: The proportion of tests I write end up being unit test, which I know is cringe. I'm sorry, but it's like I literally need to write a function and know that it's exactly correct. And I'm going to use a test to do that.

<transcript>: like usually

02:39:54
<transcript>: Like, usually when I write a test, I end up just like immediately, not even using it anymore. Like I wrote it to write the function. And then I just don't care if the test ever runs again. So that makes sense. I just ordered the envoy. I have a matrix. Oh, the envoy. Yes. Mode. Envoy. Yes. You have a matrix.

02:39:57
<transcript>: Lab. Eight. Xd. I don't know what that is.

02:40:02
<transcript>: Damn code. I don't know what that keyboard is, but I'm not that deep.

02:40:07
<transcript>: I know a lot about keycaps and a lot of switches.

02:40:07
<transcript>: i only have

02:40:13
<transcript>: I only have bought mode keyboard so I haven't really investigated the whole landscape of keyboards that you can buy. Okay anyway.

laytanl_: unit tests are cringe

02:40:28
<transcript>: Unit test is the best test. Hey, if I'm on the nexus side, I'll take it with all the new AI tooling that's come out recently, I feel like writing test free application can only benefit you. Here's why ais are not that good at engineering code from just a text input when you give it test cases, it gets more context about the code.

02:40:33
<transcript>: Yes, I agree with you next.

02:40:38
laytanl_: integration and e2e op

02:40:44
<transcript>: All right, let's get through some tweets work chronicles. Step, priority.

02:40:48
<transcript>: This tool is extremely important for us.

02:40:48
<transcript>: hang

02:40:49
phdhorrible: I make the AI write my tests

02:40:49
<transcript>: Hang on.

02:40:52
<transcript>: I like this tweet.

02:40:52
<transcript>: what's from

02:40:54

02:40:56
<transcript>: What's from Maple Fifth? It's cringe to like a Tweet from April 5. Right.

02:41:01
<transcript>: This tool is extremely important for us. We need you to build this on priority.

02:41:01
<transcript>: listen

02:41:06
<transcript>: Listen up. Marketing wants us to build an extremely important tool for them.

02:41:06
<transcript>: two weeks later

02:41:07
phdhorrible: Then I can blame the AI for bad code coverage

02:41:12
<transcript>: Two weeks later, we have the tool ready. Oh, we don't need it anymore. Yeah, that's so accurate, isn't it.

02:41:15
<transcript>: Okay, we read that.

02:41:18
thdxr: tbh I hate memes like this

02:41:19
<transcript>: Does anybody have an example for this.

02:41:19
<transcript>: an expensive mistake

02:41:20
nexxeln: aitdd = you write tests, ai write code

02:41:23
<transcript>: An expensive mistake that tests can catch.

02:41:23
<transcript>: oh i think

02:41:26
<transcript>: Oh, I think the point he's saying is.

thdxr: "hur hur we're eng and other department sucks"

02:41:35
<transcript>: Most expensive mistakes tests can't catch. But I feel like he's pointing at the middle, like we talk about that too much.

02:41:35
<transcript>: when i look at

<transcript>: Oh, the anakin. Meme. Yeah. Okay. It was a fake chuckle. It was a chuckle.

02:43:51
<transcript>: Was it fake? Or was it just a chuckle? It was a chuckle. It wasn't fake. This is annoying.

02:44:36
<transcript>: this is

<transcript>: I'm going to miss the webhook because I have an implemented them yet.

02:46:15
<transcript>: we'll see

02:46:17
<transcript>: We'll see what happens.

02:46:23
pbertrand_dev: I found the full job post again if you want proof that its real

02:46:26
lilfreezi: does adam have a black card

02:46:28
<transcript>: I want to save it.

02:46:29
thdxr: you can replay the webhook in the sst console!

02:46:29
tafiir: taking notes right now

02:46:30
<transcript>: Here we go.

02:46:36
<transcript>: It's 42, 42, 42.

02:46:44
<transcript>: Yeah, no. Send it to me. Bertrand.

02:46:49
<transcript>: Do I have a black card? I don't have a black card. I used to use an amex platinum.

pbertrand_dev: https://www.upwork.com/freelance-jobs/apply/150k-USD-year-remote-Python-Developer-using-ChatGPT_~01d6ed4a7872a2dc5a/

02:47:03
<transcript>: So here's what I need to do.

02:47:04
thdxr: no

02:47:14
thdxr: it does everything webhook thing does but it wasn't built specifically for webhooks

02:47:17
<transcript>: I can replay the webhook in the ssd console. Feels good. I can also replay it from the Strike console right.

02:47:18
thdxr: just a side-effect of how SST works

02:47:20
<transcript>: Thank You, Bertrand.

02:47:20
<transcript>: i'm going to just put

02:47:22
<transcript>: I'm going to just put this in my.

02:47:23
nexxeln: nice

02:47:27
<transcript>: So I need some help thinking about something.

02:47:32
<transcript>: Wow.

02:47:33
damko_dev: @thdxr just followed, loved the family feud show. Next time

02:47:41
pbertrand_dev: nothing else spicy in there but its real

02:47:41
<transcript>: This is awesome. Okay.

02:47:44
thdxr: @damko_dev we got crushed :(

02:47:44
<transcript>: I need to think about this.

02:47:49
<transcript>: So after we create a checkout session and we redirect you.

02:47:53
<transcript>: I still need to do something.

02:47:58
<transcript>: I still need to send the user email.

02:48:08
<transcript>: I might just need to.

02:48:16
thdxr: set it in a cookie

02:48:18
<transcript>: I'd like on this page, just land on this page.

02:48:18
<transcript>: and

02:48:20
<transcript>: And it.

02:48:22
thdxr: where do you need to send the email?

02:48:28
<transcript>: Check your email for a link to log in.

02:48:32
<transcript>: Set in a cookie. Where do you need to send the email.

02:48:39
<transcript>: Does everything webhook thing does, but it wasn't built civiliar webhooks.

02:48:45
<transcript>: Boom.

02:48:51
<transcript>: We did get crushed. What do you think? Sending a cookie? Where do you need to send the email.

02:48:51
<transcript>: so after

02:48:59
<transcript>: So after they come back? Well, really, at any point, I guess, why didn't I do it before? Oh, the only reason back? The only reason.

02:48:59
<transcript>: i didn't

02:49:01
<transcript>: I didn't just call that.

02:49:02
damko_dev: @adamdotdev are you using Phoenix here?

02:49:05
<transcript>: Find or register.

02:49:12
nexxeln: yep phoenix + react

02:49:13
<transcript>: Here. The reason I didn't just call this function is because it's in a controller, and it does all these weird connection things right here. See.

02:49:19
<transcript>: Like does all this stuff and then it returns response and I can't redirect after that.

02:49:22
<transcript>: Yeah, damn. Co it's Phoenix.

02:49:26
<transcript>: So I still need to run all this code though.

02:49:30
<transcript>: I need to run all this code, but I just don't need to return the user.

02:49:33
thdxr: call the domain functions in there

02:49:37
<transcript>: So I thought, like, this is the code I need to call, send, email.

02:49:37
<transcript>: and

02:49:39
thdxr: User.find_or_register_by_email

02:49:43
<transcript>: And I need to probably do this track new user sign up, add new user contact all that right.

02:49:43
<transcript>: all the

02:49:46
<transcript>: All the domain functions in there.

02:49:46
<transcript>: user

02:49:47
thdxr: Phoenix apps are properly structured into domains vs api

02:49:48
<transcript>: User Finder Register by email.

02:49:50
greatgrievance: this is why I always have an email service

02:49:51
<transcript>: Call the domain.

02:49:51
<transcript>: domain

02:50:00
<transcript>: Domain functions Phoenix apps are properly structured into domains versus api. Yeah, I know, I know it's proper, but it's just annoying. I'm sorry.

02:50:02
greatgrievance: because then you just chain api requests

02:50:06
thdxr: oh did they put business logic in the controller :(

02:50:19
<transcript>: I don't know. This is a controller.

02:50:22
<transcript>: You call this business logic? Yeah. Probably.

02:50:25
lesabotsy: Someone know where can I look for US remote jobs that hire outside the US? Knowing that's I live in France. I'm not looking for huge SV salary. Not some scams place like UpWork. Also @adamdotdev, suggestions to add a jobs section to the discord?

02:50:27
<transcript>: Alexa. Business Logic, right.

02:50:34
thdxr: just copy paste it?

02:50:35
elliot0x01: What you eating ?? Looks delicious HungryPaimon

02:50:36
<transcript>: Les ear. Someone know where can I look for us? Remote jobs that hire outside us.

02:50:36
<transcript>: now i live in

02:50:37
thdxr: this is throwaway code

02:50:43
<transcript>: Now I live in France. I'm not looking for huge Silicon Valley salary, not some scams like upwork.

02:50:49
<transcript>: We should have a jobs section in the discord for sure. We should do that.

02:50:53
<transcript>: We'll see.

02:50:57
<transcript>: It's throwaway code. It really is.

02:50:57
<transcript>: it's

02:50:59
damko_dev: I rewrote an Erlang CQRS example in Elixir about 6 years ago. I wonder if it even runs

02:51:17
<transcript>: It's Charlie code. I keep forgetting that elliot, I'm eating oatmeal with granola and a bunch of stuff. So you're saying just copy paste and have a version of this that doesn't. But should a controller it's not should because I don't care. But can a controller not do the thing it just did where it just responds.

02:51:17
<transcript>: can

02:51:21
<transcript>: Can the controller just passively do some asynchronous stuff.

02:51:26
<transcript>: Are you saying, just copy this code and put it outside the controller. That's what I'll do.

02:51:28
greatgrievance: you can have private controller methods

02:51:30
<transcript>: Copy this code, and I'll put it.

02:51:36
<transcript>: Next to this. Maybe.

02:51:39
<transcript>: Here.

02:51:44
<transcript>: No, I need a new function. Find a rotation by email.

02:51:48
<transcript>: We'll just do.
