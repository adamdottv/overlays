00:25:09
<transcript>: Not trying to be preachy here. Just. It's worked for me and my family. It's a book called Changer Schedule, changes.

00:25:15
<transcript>: It's got a forward by I don't know if you wrote any of the rest of the book, but Deepak Chopra.

00:25:25
silverdezign: people spend too much time on social networks before sleep or during the wake-up time that's why it's sometimes difficult

00:25:35
<transcript>: They go into the science like chronobiology. And like that our bodies really were evolved to have a certain schedule. And like, it's very tied to the sun and sun exposure. And like how our bodies wind down in the evening. And anyway, the book basically says there really is a right way.

00:25:38
<transcript>: To like sleep.

00:25:38
<transcript>: and

00:25:47
yeltrah_: Are you going to update public.dev to NextJS13 or just play with a clean project in this stream?

00:25:50
<transcript>: And time. So sleep. Not that I'm doing it right. Necessarily. Just like the idea is staying up really late and sleeping in the day is actually against what our bodies are. I don't know. Evolved to do. I don't know. Read the book.

00:25:50
<transcript>: it's

00:25:51
<transcript>: It's interesting.

00:25:54
nexxeln: my body has evolve past that Kappa

<transcript>: i've had clients

00:26:09
<transcript>: I've had clients and stuff when I was in consulting.

00:26:18
<transcript>: I work better with people in Europe than they do in the US because of time zones. Just makes more sense. Like I'm up early. Thanks for the follow. Gabriel.

00:26:23

benanna19: I thought I was up early with newborn haha. Looking forward to the discussion about the remix Shopify news

00:26:43
<transcript>: People spend too much time on social networks before sleep or during the wake up time. That's why it's sometimes difficult. I've heard that as well.

00:26:55
<transcript>: You're gonna update public adapt to next year 13. We're gonna play with it with a clean project on this stream heart. Gene, I don't think I would want to begin to unpack what it'll mean in public.

00:27:01
<transcript>: There's a few things I need to see still exists in next 13. That's one of the things we'll be checking.

00:27:19
<transcript>: Your Buddy's evolve best at. Yeah. No, you just take a look at it. I don't know if it's true. I don't know. I've definitely looked into the polyphasic sleep cycle stuff in my career when I was like, oh, if I could just have twice as much time, I would get twice as much done. I don't know if that's true.

00:27:19
<transcript>: let's

00:27:21
<transcript>: Let's get to doing stuff I thought it was.

00:27:21
<transcript>: up early

00:27:23
theruggedbear: well yeah, there is a right way "to sleep" but every person is making a personal schedule. i have friends that are more productive at night so they are managing their schedule based on that

00:27:27
<transcript>: Up early with Newborn looking forward to discussion about the remake Spotify News. Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, Shopify.

00:27:27
<transcript>: i say sp

<transcript>: I say Spotify all the time I saw Ryan tweeted something about that.

00:27:37
<transcript>: Every person's making a personal schedule. I had friends that are more productive at night. I've definitely heard that.

00:27:41
<transcript>: I know people that really enjoy working late in the night.

00:27:41
<transcript>: and i

00:27:53
<transcript>: And I can totally understand that because I really enjoy working early in the morning, which is kind of late at night for some people. So we've kind of enjoyed the same times. It's just when we slept relative to that work time.

00:27:53
<transcript>: yeah

00:27:54
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:27:54

theruggedbear: next year: React joins Vercel Kappa

00:29:08
<transcript>: And I thought he was just saying, let the dude of react stuff settle. But maybe he was saying just all of it. And I'm not trying to be critical. Like, I just really want to get a good sense for where it's at today because I've heard so many things.

00:29:08
<transcript>: and

00:29:11

yeltrah_: I see your twitter

00:30:22
benanna19: Yeah I think they kinda pitched the new layout structure to hard and it is the thing that isnâ€™t quite stable yet. But all for a lot of their innovation.

00:30:22
laytanl_: I was just listening to the podcast

00:30:22
yeltrah_: Oroginal mean girl

corfliss: Question: your stream branding looks neat, did you have some vision that you have in mind when building it?

<transcript>: That's like really old state that my computer is in when I was tweeting the teaser.

00:30:38
yeltrah_: Haha

00:30:40

laytanl_: We had this yesterday too, right?

00:30:47
<transcript>: Did this yesterday. It did this yesterday.

theruggedbear: seems like it's the same thing as yesterday's stream

00:30:50
<transcript>: I've got to, like, change this.

00:30:59
<transcript>: It's like freezing. It's like my screen capture is freezing. What a bummer.

00:31:25
<transcript>: David did it. Where is that.

00:31:28

00:31:33
<transcript>: Hill is a designer that designs a lot of stuff I work on.

00:31:33
<transcript>: and

00:31:44
<transcript>: And he made this is not it. I have, like, a big Figma file with it. But anyway, he made all the designs for the overlays and all that stuff. We built him out for like a month on stream. It took a long time.

00:31:44
<transcript>: that was a lot

00:31:46
<transcript>: That was a lot of streaming.

00:31:55
<transcript>: Just let me know you really loud. I don't know. Maybe you do something. Put something on my face or something if my screen stopped sharing.

00:31:55
<transcript>: it's an ob

00:31:57
<transcript>: It's an OBS thing. I don't know what's going on.

00:32:01
nexxeln: im thinking of writing a blog, "React: Not Just JavaScript" after seeing this next 13 stuff

00:32:03
<transcript>: Okay, let's see. I want to find.

00:32:03
<transcript>: a good

00:32:05
<transcript>: A good demo.

00:32:09
<transcript>: Maybe just the official one.

00:32:10
fredkisss: I think the react duplication was a temporary solution, it was fixed with NextJs 13.0.1 which has been released just yesterday, but in the PR of the fix they said they have to look more into it

00:32:16
<transcript>: Like, did it stop? Or did you just put something on my face for fun? Okay? You just put it on my safe for fun, okay, cool.

00:32:21
<transcript>: Thing you're running a blog react not just JavaScript after seeing this name.

00:32:21
<transcript>: stuff

00:32:23
<transcript>: Stuff.

00:32:41
<transcript>: I think the React duplication was a temporary solution. It was six with Next 1301, which has been released just yesterday. But in the PR of the fix they said they have to look more into it. Maybe we're gonna help them find something today. I don't know. I'm not trying to like, throw dirt on Versaille.

00:32:41
<transcript>: i just

00:32:46
<transcript>: I just. I need the like I said, I need to see it from myself with my own two eyes.

00:32:46
<transcript>: kind of what

00:32:49
<transcript>: Kind of what's going on today? Where we're at.

00:33:04
<transcript>: Learn more about layouts and pages, and then there's one specific thing I want to see if it still exists. It was an experimental flag I used to use for cutting out the client bundle. And I want to see if that fixes where you can have just server components and render a static thing with dynamic content.

00:33:04
<transcript>: anyway

00:33:06
<transcript>: Anyway.

00:33:11
<transcript>: Deploy an example. Let's try it out. That's what I'm looking for. Thank you. Next 13.

00:33:11
<transcript>: thank you very much

00:33:13
<transcript>: Thank you very much.

00:33:17
<transcript>: Where is it.

00:33:21
<transcript>: Deploy. I guess we could just deploy it.

00:33:25
<transcript>: Hey, I have a Versaille account. I could do that.

00:33:27
<transcript>: I can do that.

00:33:27
<transcript>: let's just do it

00:33:31
<transcript>: Let's just do it and then I guess it'll clone it into my GitHub so I can.

00:33:33
<transcript>: Right.

00:33:33
<transcript>: probably

00:33:34
<transcript>: Probably.

00:33:36

<transcript>: I got nothing to hide.

00:33:56
privann: in the example you are deploying

00:34:03
<transcript>: Next 13, in my opinion, was slow. The RSC stuff. Yeah. I want to see. I want to see what it feels like. You know, an example you're deploying. This is slow. This example.

00:34:12
<transcript>: We're about to find out.

00:34:13
privann: In my opinion yeah haha

00:34:21
<transcript>: Oh, I've got, like a Python thing. Stable diffusion. How do I get rid of that.

00:34:21
<transcript>: high end

00:34:23

00:34:40
<transcript>: I don't want it.

00:34:45
<transcript>: What if we just do this? And we start our cellover? Yeah.

<transcript>: Perhaps Pioneer virtual environment is not been loaded into your cell properly. Please restart your current cell and try again. I did that. How do I get rid of it? People name by now.

00:35:04
<transcript>: We're deploying.

00:35:08
<transcript>: And I guess I can go and clone this repo. Right.

<transcript>: Get clone.

criswritescode: nice, thank you

00:38:49
<transcript>: Dax, what are we building? We're just. I want to I told them I'm in from the showmy state. I want to see next 13 locally. I want to look at the bundle sizes on analyze the bundles. I want to play with some flags. I want to see what's going on because I've heard all the buzz about Big money.

00:38:53
<transcript>: And I just want to see them. Thanks for the follow. Chris. I appreciate that.

00:38:55
<transcript>: Okay.

00:39:00
<transcript>: So what do we want to do here? We want to I guess I'll run it locally.

00:39:07
<transcript>: Is it yarn? Or what is it.

00:39:10
<transcript>: Yarn. Okay.

00:39:10
<transcript>: and

00:39:15
<transcript>: And then there's something else I'm going to look at. Oh, yeah. Is it 130 one is the question.

00:39:18
<transcript>: Since these next. Oh, it's not.

00:39:18
<transcript>: okay

00:39:22
<transcript>: Okay. We want to do this. Oops.

00:39:25
<transcript>: We're gonna do this right.

00:39:29
<transcript>: Yarn install.

00:39:32
<transcript>: We want the latest.

00:39:32
<transcript>: greatest

00:39:33
<transcript>: Greatest.

00:39:43
<transcript>: I think I missed the follow. Thank you for the follow. A Momo Almano.

00:39:43
<transcript>: i'm sorry

00:39:45
<transcript>: I'm sorry for everyone that I bought your name.

00:39:45
<transcript>: i'm sorry

00:39:48
ghostyx101: sup adam

00:39:58
thdxr: Say my username

00:40:01
thdxr: LOL

00:40:04
<transcript>: I'm sorry if it's actually your name and I bought you. If it's just like a moniker or like some kind of a pseudonym, then I'm not as sorry because it's probably hard to read, like thdxr. What is that? What is that? Dax. I got just random letters. And that was a good strategy that allows you to get the same handle on, like, everything.

00:40:07
<transcript>: Okay.

00:40:07
<transcript>: why do they

00:40:10
<transcript>: Why do they have Why do I have all these? What.

00:40:13
<transcript>: Isn't. Wait, what.

00:40:15
<transcript>: Ui.

00:40:26
<transcript>: I'm just curious, why put all this in a UI directory? You know, I'm saying isn't the draw of the App directory that we can now drop our components in alongside our stuff like this.

00:40:26
<transcript>: what's the

00:40:28
<transcript>: What's the UI directory.

00:40:31
<transcript>: Okay, then we have a Lib.

00:40:33
<transcript>: Data.

00:40:39
<transcript>: Style Component registry.

00:40:59
<transcript>: Gag reflex. I just haven't not used tailwind in a video long time. Oh, it is tailwind. Well, then what? Styled Components? I thought that was a library. Or maybe it's just the words styled components. Okay, I gotta start some hot water, so in a minute I can take a break and go get my copy.

00:40:59
<transcript>: because this is not right

00:41:01
itswarley_: Do the Blog tutorial from Next.js

00:41:02
<transcript>: Because this is not right to not have my coffee.

00:41:10
<transcript>: What no internet connection.

00:41:10
<transcript>: what

00:41:12
<transcript>: What.

00:41:19
laytanl_: multiple pages use those components is my guess

00:41:23
<transcript>: Am I supposed to turn on my hot water on my fridge if I have a network error.

00:41:23
<transcript>: come on now

00:41:24
<transcript>: Come on now.

00:41:24
<transcript>: two thousand and twenty

00:41:26
<transcript>: 2022.

00:41:26
<transcript>: what's up

00:41:28
<transcript>: What's up? Ghosty.

00:41:31
<transcript>: Say my username.

00:41:38
benanna19: If they are following the monorepo stuff theyâ€™ve been pushing with turborepo Iâ€™m pretty sure UI is just a shared component library

00:41:39
<transcript>: Oh, Swarle says I should do the blog tutorial from next.

00:41:48
laytanl_: 418: I'm a teapot

00:41:49
<transcript>: Multiple pages use those components and my is my guess that's a good guess. Latent after following the Mona Ripa stuff they've been pushing the Turbo Reaper. I'm pretty sure UI is just a sheer component library.

00:41:49
<transcript>: why can't

00:41:54
<transcript>: Why can't I like why can't I talk to my fridge? Some of you tell me what's what's going on.

00:42:00
<transcript>: There we go.

00:42:04
<transcript>: Maybe.

00:42:04
<transcript>: floating

00:42:05
<transcript>: Floating.

00:42:05
<transcript>: so there's

00:42:07
<transcript>: So there's a blog example that's better.

00:42:11
<transcript>: Next 13 blog example.

00:42:22
<transcript>: Still Loading something's wrong. There's something wrong. You guys can hear me, right? My network's not down or something.

00:42:22
<transcript>: yeah

00:42:22
southqt: First world problems

00:42:23
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

00:42:29
<transcript>: First World Problems. Let's start. Qt. Welcome to Chat as well.

00:42:33
dendenguy: When your fridge doesn't text back :(

00:42:35
<transcript>: I just want hot water. Can I please.

00:42:38
<transcript>: I might have to give up.

00:42:38
<transcript>: okay

00:42:39
<transcript>: Okay.

00:42:41
<transcript>: So.

00:42:45
<transcript>: Let's look at.

00:42:47
cowfacedude99: I use a dumb fridge. so I won't know LUL

00:42:51
<transcript>: So I did the install. So we've got the latest. Now let's do yarn, Dev.

00:42:59
<transcript>: You have enable experimental feature after in next config. Oh is it actually an experimental the app.

00:42:59
<transcript>: you have to turn

00:43:02
<transcript>: You have to turn it on explicitly. Let's look at next config.

00:43:06
itswarley_: Oh, you already saw it :(

00:43:17
<transcript>: So after I thought it would just be on my Dault, I thought, like, if you use the app directory, you know, convention over configuration. That was just my guess, but that's interesting.

00:43:17
<transcript>: you have to

00:43:20
<transcript>: You have to actually opt into it.

00:43:24
<transcript>: Swbc minifies. True. Okay.

00:43:26
<transcript>: Well.

00:43:31
<transcript>: Did I start it up? Yes, I did. Let's take a look.

00:43:34
nexxeln: app dir is broken thats why its experimental

00:43:34
<transcript>: Local host 3000.

00:43:39
<transcript>: Fridge doesn't text back.

00:43:42
<transcript>: Use a dumb fridge so you wouldn't know.

00:43:49
<transcript>: After is broken. That's why it's experimental. Ouch next. Ouch not pulling any punches.

00:43:52
<transcript>: Throw the dirt.

00:43:52
<transcript>: throw it on

00:43:53
schrew: Gm adam!

00:43:54
<transcript>: Throw it on them.

00:44:00
<transcript>: Dax and I talked about it yesterday. It's an interesting moment. Good morning. Shrew.

00:44:00
<transcript>: interesting

00:44:06
<transcript>: Interesting moment in the web Dev history. The webdev timeline feel like there's stuff.

00:44:09
<transcript>: Happening, you know.

00:44:12
<transcript>: I.

00:44:12
<transcript>: the best

00:44:14
<transcript>: The best moment for Versailles.

00:44:16
<transcript>: From my vantage point.

00:44:22
<transcript>: It's opening up a little window for new players to really grab some.

00:44:28
<transcript>: Market share is it market share when all your stuff is free.

00:44:28
<transcript>: is that

00:44:30
<transcript>: Is that a market.

00:44:30
<transcript>: for

00:44:31
<transcript>: For.

00:44:31
<transcript>: mind

00:44:33
<transcript>: Mind share maybe.

00:44:33
<transcript>: maybe it's just

00:44:39
<transcript>: Maybe it's just mind share the thing that people use and care about.

00:44:42
<transcript>: I.

00:44:42
<transcript>: saw yesterday

00:44:51
itswarley_: Will be great to have more services like Vercel

00:44:52
<transcript>: Saw yesterday. Just while I'm waiting on my fridge. Why am I waiting? My fridge. Okay, I'm giving up. I'm not gonna be able to make any coffee. It's a bummer. I'll just have to drink water.

00:45:02
nexxeln: i migrated a new project to remix, it was easier than migrating to next 13 LUL

00:45:04
<transcript>: Will be great to have more services like this Rocelle. So that's my question. And that's what I'm thinking through right now is like I saw the switch. Tweet.

00:45:06
cowfacedude99: I tried out astro over the weekend. it is pretty refreshing as compared to vue

00:45:07
<transcript>: Where he said.

00:45:14
<transcript>: Tweeted one of his old tweets from like August that was talking about how open source front end.

00:45:14
<transcript>: kind of sucks

00:45:18
nexxeln: @itSwarley_ there's netlify

00:45:19
<transcript>: Kind of sucks. And there's not a good business model like you can work really hard, build a huge.

00:45:19
<transcript>: following of people

00:45:21
<transcript>: Following of people that use your framework.

00:45:21
<transcript>: and then

00:45:23
<transcript>: And then the reward is.

00:45:25
<transcript>: Kind of a terrible business.

00:45:25
<transcript>: selling

00:45:28
<transcript>: Selling frontend hosting.

00:45:32
<transcript>: And it's a good point, it's a good point.

00:45:32
<transcript>: i don't

00:45:38
schrew: The reward is the friends who filed issues all along

00:45:48
<transcript>: I don't know. How does this all play out? Like there's so many frontend frameworks that I think, oh, maybe they crop up and they become the thing is, the play just get acquired. Maybe it is. Maybe now this is the play. You just get acquired. You work at some company that benefits from you being at the company.

00:46:03
<transcript>: It's. I'm in kind of the shelt kit. Svelt kit. It's kind of like Rich hair is working for bracel. Except Bracell is in turn one of the frontend open source framework things that's just they happen to have a bunch of Intermoney. I don't know. It's interesting.

00:46:05
thdxr: think opensource is maybe hard for frontend frameworks but kinda awesome for other things

00:46:06
<transcript>: I'm very intrigued to see all this play out.

00:46:11
<transcript>: I migrated a new project remix it was easier than migrating to nature.

00:46:11
<transcript>: wow

00:46:11
thdxr: Business model wise

00:46:12
<transcript>: Wow.

00:46:12
<transcript>: that's

00:46:26
<transcript>: That's not good. I tried out Astro over the weekend. It is pretty refreshing. It's compared to View. Yeah, that's one of the ones I'm thinking of is Astro. And that's where my that's where I'm pointing right now is like Astro. And solid.

00:46:31
<transcript>: There's. Netlify. The reward is the friends who filed issues all along.

00:46:38
<transcript>: Sources may be hard for friend and frameworks, but kind of awesome for other things. Business model wise. Yeah.

00:46:38
<transcript>: yeah

00:46:39
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:46:42
nexxeln: i rewrote and redesigned my website in astro, will ship soon

00:46:51
<transcript>: What do the like the database services of the world, like Planet Scale. Do they open source any of their stuff? And what do they gain from it if they do.

00:46:51
<transcript>: and

00:46:53
<transcript>: And is just street cred.

00:47:00
<transcript>: Whoo look at that stuff streamed in at different times.

00:47:00
<transcript>: because

00:47:03
<transcript>: Because of streaming.

00:47:04
nexxeln: pscale is based on open source

00:47:07
<transcript>: So it's not one big spinner. I don't know. I don't know. I'm talking about.

00:47:07
<transcript>: loading

00:47:09
<transcript>: Loading.

00:47:11
<transcript>: Error States.

00:47:14
<transcript>: Trigger air.

00:47:14
<transcript>: oh

00:47:15
<transcript>: Oh.

00:47:15
nexxeln: vitess

00:47:17
<transcript>: Is that they were going for.

00:47:21
thdxr: Planetscale is sorta open source. they were big contributors to vitess, it's not theirs but that's a great model

00:47:23
<transcript>: Now, that's not what they were going for.

00:47:25
<transcript>: Or was it I don't know.

00:47:30
<transcript>: Okay.

00:47:30
<transcript>: data fetching

00:47:32
<transcript>: Data fetching static site generation.

00:47:36
<transcript>: Server side rendering.

00:47:39
<transcript>: Last rendered just now.

00:47:44
<transcript>: So none of this is refreshing.

00:47:44
<transcript>: like

00:47:51
<transcript>: Like none of this stuff is having to rerender. It's just the thing inside here that's having to rerender.

00:47:52
fredkisss: While testing, when deploying NextJs to vercel without edge, the TTFB was very slow (one second at most) and since loading states on NextJs are only as fast as the TTFB, It seemed very slow for me (Iâ€™m in France). Iâ€™ve tested with CDN and in America for ex itâ€™s about 500 ms at best ðŸ¤”

00:47:55
<transcript>: Incremental. Static regeneration.

00:47:57
<transcript>: Last generator.

00:48:02
<transcript>: So that all still exists.

00:48:02
<transcript>: client

00:48:04
<transcript>: Client, context.

00:48:13
<transcript>: Pass context between client components across the server client component boundary. Click the counter and navigate between pages. Okay, so let's just.

00:48:13
<transcript>: look

00:48:15
<transcript>: Look at this thing.

00:48:15
<transcript>: next

00:48:20
<transcript>: Next 13 gold. That means it's the gold standard of next 13.

00:48:20
<transcript>: oh

00:48:25
<transcript>: Oh, I didn't push the next 13 one update. Let's do that.

00:48:28
<transcript>: To the deploy deployed thing.

00:48:40
<transcript>: Depth.

00:48:42
<transcript>: Next 30.

00:48:45
<transcript>: One.

00:48:55
<transcript>: Okay. Let's see if that makes a difference. I wanted to start looking at, like, what's coming over the wire. And then we'll do the bundle Analyzer.

00:49:06
cowfacedude99: yarn? not pnpm?

00:49:06
<transcript>: Reroute and redesign my website nashro will ship soon. Pscale is based on open source oh yeah Vitas Vitess? I'm not gonna say that.

00:49:11
<transcript>: They were big contributors to Vitas. It's not theirs, but that's a great model.

00:49:11
<transcript>: while testing

00:49:27
<transcript>: While testing when deploying Next JS to our cell with out edge, the time to first bite was very slow 1 second at most. And since Loading States on next JS are only as fast as the time to first bite seem very slow. For me. In France, I've tested with CDN in America, for example, it's about 500 milligrams of best.

00:49:27
<transcript>: yeah

00:49:34
<transcript>: Yeah, I think they're default to paint as they yarn cafes. I did the same.

00:49:34
pheralb: nexxeln :D

00:49:35
<transcript>: Yeah, it's yarn.

00:49:43
<transcript>: Yeah. I would like to see a default of PMPM. I don't know. Have we all agreed? Is it consensus yet.

00:49:43
<transcript>: the consensus

00:49:46
<transcript>: The consensus that PMPM is.

00:49:46
<transcript>: the best

00:49:48
<transcript>: The best.

00:49:48
<transcript>: so

00:49:52
<transcript>: So let's let's do some of this. I've seen some of this.

00:49:55
<transcript>: Is it just for sale.com.

00:49:57
nexxeln: hi pheral

00:50:01
kociqq: pnpm is still not default? ayezeeSAD

00:50:06
<transcript>: I saw somebody post this, and I don't know if it's true, but I saw somebody posts that the Versaille.

00:50:06
<transcript>: like

00:50:09
<transcript>: Like Lighthouse scores. We even are bad.

00:50:14
<transcript>: Pmpm is still not default.

00:50:34
<transcript>: Yeah. Like what's this about? I feel like Isn't Lighthouse just like an easy thing to game and like anybody can make a good lineout score, even if your side isn't that great.

00:50:35
nexxeln: oh damn

00:50:36
<transcript>: And they're not even doing that.

00:50:41
<transcript>: And this is all the next 13 stuff, right.

00:50:43
<transcript>: What's going on? People.

00:50:43
<transcript>: what's going on over

00:50:45
schrew: I've been gaming lighthouse at work for the last week LUL

00:50:49
<transcript>: What's going on over there? Versaille. I feel like this is uncharacteristic of herself. And I know they're all working very hard. I'm not trying to like.

00:50:54
<transcript>: Bash them. I really don't want to just come off as.

00:51:05
<transcript>: Like, I'm attacking verselle. It's just. It's just uncharacteristic. They set the bar high. I expect a lot of them, you know, just trying to, like, understand what's going on.

00:51:05
<transcript>: so

00:51:11
fredkisss: Vercel does not use next 13 yet

00:51:12
<transcript>: So is this just because of some 3D things? Like if we go to Versaille.com? I guess I have to, like, log out.

00:51:14
<transcript>: Or.

00:51:17
<transcript>: Just do this.

00:51:17
<transcript>: now

00:51:18
<transcript>: Now.

00:51:20
nexxeln: vercel.com/home

00:51:22
<transcript>: I don't want to have another browser up because you buy.

00:51:24
<transcript>: I'll just log out.

00:51:27
cowfacedude99: I actually like pnpm with git worktrees. especially when I forget to prune worktrees

00:51:32
<transcript>: Is this like some like WebGL thing and that's why they're LCP so bad.

00:51:39
<transcript>: But this isn't the LCP. This is that's a lot of JavaScript.

00:51:46
<transcript>: Right. Okay. Did it. Did it. Deploy. It'd be a handy time to be logged into Versaille. And I need to know if that thing finished deploying.

00:51:53
<transcript>: Versailles does not use Nick 13 yet. Oh, it doesn't.

00:51:53
<transcript>: okay

00:51:54
<transcript>: Okay.

00:51:54
<transcript>: okay

00:51:55
<transcript>: Okay.

00:51:58
<transcript>: Interest.

00:52:04
<transcript>: Get work trees, especially when I forget to Peru in work trees. I just like Pnpm because.

00:52:07
nexxeln: i think it does didn't they talk about it??

00:52:09
<transcript>: It makes more sense to me. Like what it's doing in my node modules. Makes more sense.

00:52:09
<transcript>: okay

00:52:16
<transcript>: Okay. It did. Update to 13 one, so let's take a look at our thing. This is 13 one now I think.

00:52:20
<transcript>: Let's just look 119 KB transferred.

00:52:23
<transcript>: Let's look at JavaScript.

00:52:28
<transcript>: So.

00:52:32
<transcript>: What.

00:52:32
<transcript>: so

00:52:36
<transcript>: So compressed is like 119.

00:52:41
<transcript>: But uncompressed. Javascript. Is that uncompressed? I don't remember.

00:52:43
<transcript>: Is that uncompressed.

00:52:43
<transcript>: no

00:52:48
<transcript>: No way it's 293 KB right.

00:52:48
<transcript>: right

00:52:49
<transcript>: Right.

00:52:49
<transcript>: someone tell

00:52:52
<transcript>: Someone tell me that's not that's not uncompressed.

00:52:56
<transcript>: 293.

00:53:01
<transcript>: I mean.

00:53:01
<transcript>: i don't

00:53:06
<transcript>: I don't know what I don't haven't looked that hard at what this thing is, but.

00:53:06
<transcript>: i don't

00:53:08
<transcript>: I don't that seems like a lot.

00:53:14
<transcript>: Seems like a lot.

00:53:17
<transcript>: Let's do the bundle Analyzer thing.

00:53:25
<transcript>: I could just be reading all this wrong too. Like am I reading this wrong? What's that say if I do the.

00:53:25
<transcript>: where's

00:53:26
<transcript>: Where's that tab.

00:53:28
fredkisss: 200 is uncompressed

00:53:33
<transcript>: What am I looking for? Timing. No.

00:53:40
<transcript>: It's 64K.

00:53:40
<transcript>: compressed

00:53:45
<transcript>: Compressed resource size one hundred and ninety eight K. So that bundle right there.

00:53:48
<transcript>: Just this way.

00:53:50
<transcript>: Bundle. Here. Is.

00:53:54
<transcript>: Almost 200K uncompressed.

00:53:57
<transcript>: And that one's. 54.

00:54:01
schrew: Not sure if vercel comes with sourcemaps, but that can cause tripups in reporting the size of bundles

00:54:03
<transcript>: And then little Ten K on your uncompressed. That's a lot of JavaScript. It's a lot. It's a lot.

00:54:08
<transcript>: Let's let's do this.

00:54:13
<transcript>: It's a web Dev measure it while I switch your.

00:54:22
<transcript>: Edith, even if it's not next 13 why is Versello.com doing so terribly on the LightOut scores.

00:54:22
<transcript>: it doesn't seem like

00:54:25
<transcript>: It doesn't seem like a thing. They would let happen.

00:54:28
<transcript>: Okay.

00:54:31
<transcript>: Let's do the bike Analyzer. What do you say.

00:54:45
<transcript>: And then I want to see if I can turn off. I want to see if I can make a page that's only server components and disable the client bundle and see if that still works. You can do that in the next twelve.

00:54:52
<transcript>: Not sure Versal comes with source map that can cause triviates in reporting inside the bundles. Oh, interesting. Okay.

00:54:52
kociqq: analyzer for the rescue ayezeePray

00:54:56
<transcript>: So this did well.

00:54:58
<transcript>: This is great.

00:55:07
<transcript>: Is the bundle, not.

00:55:07
<transcript>: is it not

00:55:13
<transcript>: Is it not as bad as I thought? I guess like a big giant JavaScript bundle doesn't necessarily mean.

00:55:13
<transcript>: bad

00:55:15
<transcript>: Bad.

00:55:17
<transcript>: Or bad Lighthouse scores. Right.

00:55:21
<transcript>: I.

00:55:32
<transcript>: 'm not running. It.

00:55:34
<transcript>: Yarn Dev.

00:55:44
<transcript>: Oh, it's not so it's not running tail in because.

00:55:44
<transcript>: oh yeah

00:55:52
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, we're not doing pretty turbo pack. Yeah, that's just turbo pack. But you can't. Okay, never mind, nothing to see here? Nothing to see.

00:55:52
<transcript>: sem

00:55:54
laytanl_: 200kb isn't giant though?

00:55:56
<transcript>: Semi false. Thank you.

00:55:56
<transcript>: good

00:55:57
<transcript>: Good.

00:56:03
laytanl_: is it?

00:56:04
<transcript>: Am I the only person that doesn't like semicolon's and just look so much more aesthetically pleasing to me when they're not there.

00:56:10
<transcript>: 200k isn't giant. I mean.

00:56:11
nexxeln: semi false monkaS

00:56:17
kociqq: full app 200kb is very okay

00:56:19
kociqq: no?

00:56:20
<transcript>: It depends on what we're talking about. Like, what I want to know is what's the minimum bundle I can ship for a page that has no client interactivity.

00:56:23
<transcript>: You know, I'm saying like.

00:56:23
<transcript>: what can i

00:56:25
<transcript>: What can I do.

00:56:25
<transcript>: like if

00:56:32
<transcript>: Like if I just want to render HDR pages, but I'm gonna use the React component model and I want to.

00:56:32
<transcript>: fetch data using

00:56:39
<transcript>: Fetch data using the new Unified Fetch Stuff and React, and I want I guess it wouldn't be suspense. There would be no.

00:56:39
<transcript>: yeah no

00:56:49
<transcript>: Yeah. No, I guess the suspense stuff would still play in, but I could still not have any client interactivity and use all that stuff. Just have pages that are dynamic rendering HTML.

00:56:51
<transcript>: And no.

00:56:51
<transcript>: client

00:56:54
cmjio: PHP: hold my beer ;)

00:57:00
<transcript>: Client components whatsoever. What is the minimum bundle I can ship if it's 200K, that feels like a lot like if you're thinking of a storefront, like an Ecommerce storefront.

00:57:00
<transcript>: that's

00:57:02
<transcript>: That's a lot of JavaScript, right? Like.

00:57:07
<transcript>: Am I mistaken? Is that not a lot.

00:57:07
<transcript>: are we saying

00:57:10
<transcript>: Are we saying 200K is totally normal.

00:57:10
<transcript>: for like

00:57:12
<transcript>: For like a portfolio side.

00:57:18
<transcript>: Or just a non spa site in general. I feel like that's a lot.

00:57:21
developmentrobot: did you see shopify acquiring remix?

00:57:22
nexxeln: that is huge

00:57:25
<transcript>: Like if you did so this is web Dev measure which is like Lighthouse. But if you did.

00:57:25
<transcript>: web page

00:57:27
kociqq: well yeah that is huge

00:57:33
<transcript>: Web Page. What is it called Webpage test or whatever. If you did the actual thing where you like, run it on low devices.

00:57:33
<transcript>: tuner case

00:57:34
<transcript>: Tuner Case a lot.

00:57:34
<transcript>: am i wrong

00:57:36
<transcript>: Am I wrong.

00:57:41
<transcript>: Okay. Next says it's huge.

00:57:49
<transcript>: It's not about transfer. It's about like the page having to do stuff with all that JavaScript, right.

00:57:59
<transcript>: And also just like for what if if my page doesn't do any client side interactive stuff, what is two hundred K of JavaScript doing for me.

00:58:03
<transcript>: There are people who would like.

00:58:03
<transcript>: vomit

00:58:05
<transcript>: Vomit.

00:58:05
<transcript>: on

00:58:06
<transcript>: On Twitter.

00:58:06
<transcript>: if you

00:58:14
kociqq: LUL

00:58:22
<transcript>: If you told them that you're gonna ship two hundred K of JavaScript with your like econber site. Now these are the same people. They're pretty inflammatory, the other on the other side where they're like, you shouldn't use any JavaScript. Javascript's terrible. Progressively enhanced with.

00:58:22
<transcript>: none of it

00:58:24
<transcript>: None of it.

00:58:24
<transcript>: but

00:58:24
mindrage: Have you tried Qwik? if so, whats your opinion about it

00:58:28
<transcript>: But I'm just saying, like I think 200K is objectively on the high side.

00:58:32
nexxeln: what is that website which measures on other devices?

00:58:33
<transcript>: I have not tried quick. Maybe we'll try it on stream.

00:58:36
<transcript>: Maybe.

00:58:42
<transcript>: What is that website which measures on other devices. Oh, yeah, yeah. That's this. So like if I do.

00:58:46
<transcript>: This. I'll have that in there. No, that's true. This one.

00:58:50
laytanl_: Yeah but that's Twitter LUL

00:58:52
<transcript>: Do this one. It's this one, right. Simple configuration. We can do mobile.

00:58:58
<transcript>: We could probably still do simple if there's just like.

00:59:01
nexxeln: oh interesting

00:59:09
<transcript>: Repeat view or maybe we do want to do this. So what's the standard here? Do people do 3G.

00:59:14
<transcript>: Like videos. 3g fast or just 3G in the middle.

00:59:18
<transcript>: Mobile, I want mobile.

00:59:18
<transcript>: is this

00:59:19
<transcript>: Is this not mobile.

00:59:19
<transcript>: oh bra oh

00:59:23
<transcript>: Oh, Bra. Oh, here we go. Test location. Sure.

00:59:25
<transcript>: Browser.

00:59:30
<transcript>: Where do I choose that I'm mobile device. Clearly. I've done a lot of experiments in my time.

00:59:35
<transcript>: It's a simple the way to go should it be simple.

00:59:39
<transcript>: And we'll repeat, let's do that. I don't know.

00:59:39
<transcript>: that's

00:59:49
<transcript>: That's four G. Oh, here we go. Let's do an international Oops go back undo. So this is a more like straps test 3G mobile.

00:59:49
<transcript>: and

00:59:51
<transcript>: And it's from India.

00:59:54
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:00:02
<transcript>: Yeah, but that's Twitter. That's a good call Laden. I definitely I get two wrapped up in the Twitter.

01:00:02
<transcript>: the twitter

01:00:03
nexxeln: i have 5g at my home

01:00:04
<transcript>: The, Twitter's, Twitter.

01:00:07
<transcript>: Slaymores.

01:00:10
<transcript>: You have five G at your home. Next.

01:00:18
<transcript>: Maybe this is like if you're actually on a device out and about and you don't have good self coverage. I don't know.

01:00:26
<transcript>: All right, this is the part of the day where we turn on shuffle.

01:00:30
<transcript>: And we leave the warm embrace of Alt J. And we explore other.

01:00:30
<transcript>: other

01:00:33
<transcript>: Other areas of the playlist.

01:00:36
<transcript>: I can't believe I can't get coffee going.

01:00:38
<transcript>: Gonna try while we're waiting on this test.

01:00:54
<transcript>: Still testing.

01:00:59
<transcript>: Still to out there we go.

01:01:00
<transcript>: What does it say.

01:01:06
jenswoeste: and as we learned from a previous stream you participate in the "twitterverse" even when in "BRB" mode LUL

01:01:09
<transcript>: So.

01:01:12
<transcript>: Okay, the results not as easy to parse.

01:01:15
<transcript>: Is it quick needs improvement.

01:01:21
<transcript>: Slot O'clock Connect and Deliver initial code. Is it usable? Not bad.

01:01:24
<transcript>: Is it resilient. Looks great.

01:01:24
<transcript>: zero

01:01:28
<transcript>: Zero render blocking third party request so I think.

01:01:33
<transcript>: It's a lot of JavaScript. I think they're doing the right thing, though, with that JavaScript.

01:01:33
<transcript>: does that make sense

01:01:34
<transcript>: Does that make sense.

01:01:34
<transcript>: like

01:01:35
jenswoeste: hey adam & chat btw

01:01:39
<transcript>: Like they're not running it on the main thread. It's like they're doing.

01:01:39
<transcript>: the

01:01:44
<transcript>: The right thing. I don't know. I'm not a friend of developer. Why am I even acting like it.

01:01:44
<transcript>: there's

01:01:46
<transcript>: There's like a good way in a bad way.

01:01:46
<transcript>: to have

01:01:54
<transcript>: To have a bunch of JavaScript, and I think they're doing the good way. But again, there are people who would say there's never a good way to have that much JavaScript.

01:01:54
<transcript>: okay

01:01:59
<transcript>: Okay. Let's but the my point is like if I'm not using client components.

01:01:59
<transcript>: what

01:02:02
<transcript>: What is the best case scenario. And that's what I want to find out.

01:02:02
<transcript>: so

01:02:03
<transcript>: So.

01:02:03
<transcript>: am i running

01:02:05
schrew: hi @JensWoeste !

01:02:06
<transcript>: Am I running this again? Should I run it.

01:02:06
<transcript>: yes okay

01:02:07
<transcript>: Yes. Okay.

01:02:18
<transcript>: So some of these probably don't already probably don't have any client components. Right. So like, let's look at layouts. This would be the Nested layouts, I guess. Yeah.

01:02:21
<transcript>: Layouts, Category slug.

01:02:23
<transcript>: To any of these.

01:02:26
<transcript>: Here's the Layout page.

01:02:30
<transcript>: Which I think a layout has to be serverside. And here's the page.

01:02:33
<transcript>: Also has to be serverside right.

01:02:35
<transcript>: Template.

01:02:48
<transcript>: Subcategory now. Okay. Here's a client. So this is a this subnav right here. This is a client component.

01:02:52
<transcript>: So this does client thing.

01:02:57
<transcript>: But what if I remove that.

01:03:05
<transcript>: Or what if I just said it's not a compliant client component? And what if I just made them anchor Tags or something.

01:03:06
fredkisss: Layout and pages can be client side also

01:03:11
<transcript>: You know, I'm getting that trying to make a whole section here that has no.

01:03:11
<transcript>: client

01:03:12
<transcript>: Client.

01:03:15
<transcript>: Components.

01:03:23
<transcript>: As we learned from a previous stream, you participate in the Twitter verse, even when in BRB mod.

01:03:23
<transcript>: hey

01:03:25
<transcript>: Heyens.

01:03:32
<transcript>: Layout and pages can be client side also. Oh, they can. How does that work.

01:03:39
<transcript>: I still don't understand anything. Thanks for the follows games. And Alex.

01:03:48
<transcript>: I think I'm gonna restart my phone.

01:03:52
<transcript>: I think that's where we're at I think my phone is.

01:03:55
<transcript>: Needs to be restarted.

01:03:56
nexxeln: just "use client" to make it a client component

01:03:57
<transcript>: So.

01:03:57
<transcript>: if

01:04:01
<transcript>: If I removed or remove this subcategory. Nav.

01:04:03
<transcript>: navigate

01:04:04
<transcript>: Navigate.

01:04:04
<transcript>: nav

01:04:05
<transcript>: Nav.

01:04:11
<transcript>: Or I just stopped importing it and using Tags. Right.

01:04:11
<transcript>: layout

01:04:12
<transcript>: Layout.

01:04:12
<transcript>: so this is an

01:04:15
<transcript>: So this is an category. Slug.

01:04:18
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:04:21
<transcript>: Okay. I.

01:04:23
fredkisss: The nav up there show the current selected route so it needs to be client side, while the nav down can be server I think

01:04:29
<transcript>: Know that's under route groups. So here this layout probably uses the subcategory NAV. Yeah.

01:04:31
<transcript>: Okay.

01:04:34
<transcript>: So what if we did this? What if we said.

01:04:34
<transcript>: no

01:04:36
<transcript>: No. Subcategory. Nf.

01:04:39
<transcript>: And we're here.

01:04:41
<transcript>: Nested layouts so.

01:04:44
<transcript>: Wait.

01:04:48
<transcript>: For more subcategory. Now no.

01:04:55
<transcript>: It's category. Now do I miss this one? This one's also a client. Okay.

01:04:55
<transcript>: so let's

01:04:57
<transcript>: So let's go to this.

01:04:59
<transcript>: And let's go down here.

01:05:02
<transcript>: Okay.

01:05:07
<transcript>: That's categories. That's fine. I think we're just.

01:05:12
<transcript>: Okay.

01:05:17
<transcript>: So now, no client components. Is that accurate.

01:05:20
<transcript>: No Client components.

01:05:24
<transcript>: Also no links so won't be able to.

01:05:30
<transcript>: Build it. Yeah. Like we have no links now, right? Zero clicks. What is that.

01:05:36
<transcript>: Page zero. Clicks. What is it? What is it.

01:05:42
<transcript>: Boundary.

01:05:50
<transcript>: First the zero clicks, oh click counter. That's probably a client can component to right.

01:05:54
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:06:10
<transcript>: Yeah, that's a client component. Okay, so let's do this. Let's get rid of all client components. No client components on this page layouts is completely server rendered, right? I don't know. That just did a little flash thing that made me think it's just JavaScript.

01:06:16
<transcript>: So that's the layout. Here's, the page.

01:06:22
<transcript>: I see no components here.

01:06:22
<transcript>: templ

01:06:26
<transcript>: Template? Is it this boundary thing? What is this boundary thing.

01:06:32
<transcript>: Not client.

01:06:34
<transcript>: Okay.

01:06:34
<transcript>: well

01:06:36
<transcript>: Well.

01:06:36
<transcript>: what's

01:06:43
fredkisss: The flash thing could be css

01:06:50
<transcript>: What's causing that little animation? It could just be CSS. Oh, it is. It is. It's just CSS. Okay. Cool. So this should theoretically, this route should not have JavaScript, right? I mean, we shouldn't have any client components. Not that it shouldn't have JavaScript, but this is just straight.

01:06:50
<transcript>: serverside component

01:06:52
<transcript>: Serverside, components.

01:06:53
<transcript>: I do believe.

01:06:56
<transcript>: Yeah, it's a CSS. Cool.

01:07:06
<transcript>: The NAV up there show the current selected route so it needs to client side while the NAV down can be server I think.

01:07:12
<transcript>: Yes. So this side nav. I guess I should look at the top level.

01:07:17
<transcript>: Let's see top level layout is right here.

01:07:17
<transcript>: and there's a global

01:07:19
<transcript>: And there's a global NAV in it.

01:07:24
<transcript>: Global NAV. That's also. Yeah. Okay.

01:07:30
<transcript>: I mean, I could get rid of it, but now we're just like.

01:07:33
<transcript>: We're down to a shell.

01:07:36
<transcript>: This is a shell of a thing.

01:07:39
<transcript>: But is it all serversight, components.

01:07:41
<transcript>: Can I be sure.

01:07:47
<transcript>: What about that footer.

01:07:50
<transcript>: What's a dress, bar.

01:07:50
<transcript>: oh

01:07:56
<transcript>: Oh, that thing. This is this the address part? No. Or Yes.

01:07:58
<transcript>: Is it.

01:08:00
kociqq: can you make the global nav a async function or is that not in yet ðŸ¤”

01:08:02
dedadev: what do you use for the keystrokes overlay?

01:08:03
<transcript>: Also client side okay.

01:08:12
<transcript>: There's gonna be nothing left on the page, but hey, it's all serverside.

01:08:15
<transcript>: I want to make sure.

01:08:25
<transcript>: Can you make the global NAV a single function or is that not in yet.

01:08:25
<transcript>: i'm not

01:08:29
<transcript>: I'm not sure what you mean. What do you use for the keystrokes? Overlay.

01:08:29
oetziofficial: why is almost everything 'use client'? ðŸ‘€

01:08:32
<transcript>: Oh keycaster.

01:08:32
<transcript>: this thing

01:08:34
fredkisss: You can go to global nav, and modify the component to be server only

01:08:34
<transcript>: This thing down here? Yeah, keycaster.

01:08:38
<transcript>: Hey, did we do it? We got rid of all.

01:08:42
<transcript>: All of the client side.

01:08:46
<transcript>: Is that a client side thing.

01:08:48
kociqq: yeah by making it a async function

01:08:52
<transcript>: Is link a client component. I bet it is.

01:08:54
kociqq: it should be server side only then

01:08:54
<transcript>: Is it.

01:08:59
<transcript>: Is it possible to make something that has no.

01:09:06
<transcript>: Oh, well, that page wouldn't be rendered right, because this we're going into the layout that would be the page.

01:09:06
<transcript>: here

01:09:07
<transcript>: Here.

01:09:15
<transcript>: This is that page, but we are in the layouts page. This should be entirely server rendered, I believe.

01:09:18
fredkisss: @kociqq there is a hook in there that needs to be removed first

01:09:18
<transcript>: There should not be any client components involved.

01:09:18
kociqq: but that was in the rfc so I am not sure if it's implemented yet

01:09:23
<transcript>: And I'm not expecting this to be good. We're in the Dev mode. Let's just switch over to.

01:09:27
fredkisss: Link is a client component

01:09:27
<transcript>: What.

01:09:32
<transcript>: Let's do Yo yarn build and yarn start.

01:09:36
<transcript>: That link is a client component.

01:09:39
<transcript>: There's a hook.

01:09:39
<transcript>: i had a hook

01:09:41
<transcript>: I had a hook somewhere.

01:09:57
<transcript>: Modify the component to be server only in the global net. Oh, that's a good idea. Why was it? Why was it a certain? Or why was it a client component? What is it doing.

01:09:57
<transcript>: is using

01:10:09
<transcript>: Is using Next link. I bet. Yeah. So we'd have to make all those, like, anchor Tags. We could I think this is good enough for our test, though, if we're just trying to see, like, server components by themselves with no.

01:10:12
<transcript>: Client components. Right.

01:10:12
<transcript>: okay

01:10:13
<transcript>: Okay.

01:10:23
<transcript>: So here's this test. And then we're gonna do some bundle analyzing. Oh, did it do it already? Wait. Is it 30? Yeah. Next start.

01:10:26
<transcript>: Enable Experimental feature.

01:10:32
<transcript>: Layouts.

01:10:35
<transcript>: Did anything change.

01:10:38
<transcript>: Still got that by.

01:10:48
<transcript>: 200k uncompressed bundle. What is this? This react and everything else. So I guess they do ship react regardless.

01:10:51
<transcript>: Of whether you're using client components.

01:10:51
<transcript>: for

01:10:53
<transcript>: For reasons.

01:10:53
fredkisss: There is a hook â€˜useSelectedLayoutSegmentâ€™ that only work in client components

01:10:58
<transcript>: Surely that goes away. Right. Surely they're going to.

01:10:58
<transcript>: use

01:11:02
<transcript>: Use selected layer segment that only work in client components. Okay.

01:11:09
<transcript>: Thank you for the follows. Vina and Obi Neku.

01:11:09
<transcript>: i'm sorry

01:11:12
<transcript>: I'm sorry. I just now saw those.

01:11:25
<transcript>: So I think they're gonna probably remove this. I think eventually if you're hitting around that has no client components, they probably don't ship reaction on those routes in the future. Right. That's an optimization I haven't gotten to. I think I saw something Dan said.

01:11:31
<transcript>: From Dan, Abraham.

01:11:35
<transcript>: Oh, Geez, what are my DMs done up.

01:11:38
<transcript>: Dan a brave.

01:11:39
oetziofficial: have you removed the .next folder before building? sometimes it had code it in which also got "shipped"

01:11:41
<transcript>: From him.

01:11:43
<transcript>: From Dan.

01:11:46
<transcript>: A. Bra. Moth.

01:11:46
<transcript>: opt

01:11:48
<transcript>: Optimization.

01:11:54
<transcript>: I just saw a tweet skipping renders example Nas 29.

01:11:57
<transcript>: When I'm on recently.

01:11:57
<transcript>: latest

01:11:58
<transcript>: Latest.

01:12:08
<transcript>: Issues. There's not a route in the middle. I expect that to be most common if you allow me to be tongued to you, it almost sounds like you're saying remix. That's not it.

01:12:19
<transcript>: Synthetically. This releases raw. It's a dawn of a new paradigm. Wait a minute. The 25th. That was like a week ago.

01:12:19
<transcript>: error messages

01:12:22
<transcript>: Error messages. Automations will be missing.

01:12:25
<transcript>: I know I just saw.

01:12:25
<transcript>: a

01:12:26
<transcript>: A.

01:12:31
<transcript>: Message.

01:12:31
<transcript>: he or a tweet

01:12:32
<transcript>: He or a tweet.

01:12:34
<transcript>: Maybe.

01:12:35
fredkisss: This hook helps to show for example the active link in the nav

01:12:36
<transcript>: Optimized.

01:12:42
<transcript>: Not this one.

01:12:59
<transcript>: No, not one looking for. I know. I thought it was Dan. I'm pretty sure.

01:13:04
fredkisss: Go to his profile, surely it is a recent tweet

01:13:05
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow Emir.

01:13:10
<transcript>: Surely it's a recent tweet.

01:13:10
<transcript>: i don't know how much

01:13:11
<transcript>: I don't know. How much does he tweet.

01:13:15
<transcript>: Duplication has been fixed.

01:13:21
<transcript>: Has bugs that cause framework code to be done on multiple times.

01:13:23
<transcript>: They're still shaking those out.

01:13:23
<transcript>: pun intended

01:13:26
<transcript>: Pun intended tree shaking them out.

01:13:28
<transcript>: That's funny.

01:13:31
<transcript>: But that's not what I'm looking for.

01:13:37
<transcript>: I think it was actually.

01:13:37
<transcript>: this

01:13:39
<transcript>: This.

01:13:48
<transcript>: Inconsistency. Here I was referring to the big difference in overall size between.

01:13:48
<transcript>: that

01:13:53
<transcript>: That reasons because there's inconsistency surrounding whether links on the page are automatically preloaded or not.

01:14:14
<transcript>: Purpose, not the full picture.

01:14:14
<transcript>: should i stop

01:14:16
<transcript>: Should I stop focusing on perf.

01:14:19
<transcript>: Though I'm hearing.

01:14:29
<transcript>: Oh, I miss some of these.

01:14:42
<transcript>: Reserve a component being owned by Next Sh team. Honestly don't know what you mean by this. They were implemented by two other frameworks before Next test. In fact feedback from them hydrogen Remix is what led to the latest design. So make sure this is more like another implementer.

01:14:47
<transcript>: Reasync support being surprising. We made a final decision. Support a few days before publishing RT.

01:14:54
<transcript>: Well, this is fun. Just looking at all of Dan's tweets.

01:14:54
<transcript>: next

01:15:00
<transcript>: Next. Yes. Isn't the only possible solution. I'd like to see many, but it's the most complete impedition of the architecture right now.

01:15:02
<transcript>: Okay.

01:15:22
<transcript>: Something wrong with React server components as the architecture. It seems like it's natural for me to care about this. Do you think it's out of place? I think there's a line somewhere between goodnatured criticism and being straight Apostle and assuming malicious intent. I admit the past few days I felt more louder than the former. Maybe it's a sign for me to disconnect from this community again. Or at least on parts. Lots of bummer. I don't want Dan.

01:15:22
<transcript>: to feel bad

01:15:26
<transcript>: To feel bad, and I don't want to cross that line for what it's worth.

01:15:26
<transcript>: i

01:15:46
<transcript>: I I want to know just like, where are we at? I'm not trying to criticize for the sake, from criticizing. I just want to know, like there are. There's actually a very big decision for me in terms of the stack. And I want to know, do I want to use server components today in Next JS for a site that really needs to just render stuff fast on the server dynamic.

01:15:55
<transcript>: Content and not ship a lot of client in our activity? Or do I want to use something like astronauts solid? So my research is purely practical.

01:15:55
<transcript>: and i'm not trying

01:16:00
<transcript>: And I'm not trying to just flame the reacting or the next team.

01:16:15
<transcript>: Okay we have some good ironizations coming to this. The fact that it's sending any JS at all is interesting though with next year you can refresh this content in the background without leaving replacing client have.

01:16:17
<transcript>: Is that what I'm looking for.

01:16:36
<transcript>: Included in the client bundle. The problem we're seeing is not the server components are included in the client bundle. It's that there is a client bundle when we're not using any client components, that's the optimization. I'm looking for a comment. I thought I saw that he commented on that.

01:16:41
<transcript>: Once in the register. So basically in exchange.

01:16:54
<transcript>: Still looking for it.

01:17:25
<transcript>: Oh, no, Dan not happy about primes.

01:17:34
<transcript>: Okay. I'm not finding it. That's okay.

01:17:42
<transcript>: This is back to the 29th. It was. I think I think it was after that. Anyway. I think.

01:17:42
<transcript>: this

01:17:45
dedadev: any windows alternative for keycastr

01:17:46
<transcript>: This may be the one I was thinking of, but it may not have been Dan, I guess.

01:17:46
<transcript>: this

01:17:47
<transcript>: This tweet.

01:17:53
<transcript>: No.

01:17:55
<transcript>: nope

01:17:55
<transcript>: nope nope right

01:17:57
<transcript>: Nope. Nope. Right here.

01:18:06
<transcript>: I think for the following.

01:18:18
<transcript>: Windows Alternative for Key Castor. I'm not aware of one day to Dev, but I haven't done a lot of research into it. Somebody just told me about Keycaster and so I used it.

01:18:32
<transcript>: Okay, we should add a switch to opt out, but we can also have a heroistic. The interesting question is when does it make sense if you have client animations or able to launch new content live in place, even simple cases that use no extracan components can still benefit.

01:18:43
<transcript>: No client components. This is what I'm saying up top of my head. I'd say if there are no client components and no navigation rare, don't load the runtime at all. Otherwise load the right time at the lowest priority, unless the side Ops out.

01:18:45
<transcript>: Okay.

01:18:47
<transcript>: So.

01:18:47
<transcript>: so it's

01:18:50
<transcript>: So it's not Apple's to apples with like.

01:18:57
<transcript>: Islands, right? Like Astro stuff. You're gonna get the client bundle.

01:19:02
<transcript>: Like, even if you don't have client components, we've confirmed that we're seeing it right here.

01:19:11
<transcript>: So then the question is, can I turn off the client bundle? I used to do this in next twelve. And I just wonder if you can.

01:19:11
<transcript>: still

01:19:13
fredkisss: Can you share this link

01:19:15
<transcript>: Still do it. So let's go to it'd be the layouts page.

01:19:19
<transcript>: And let's do.

01:19:26
<transcript>: It. No, it's like up here. No.

01:19:26
oetziofficial: can you turn off javascript?

01:19:31
<transcript>: So export.

01:19:36
<transcript>: What is it? I don't remember. Next. Yes.

01:19:40
<transcript>: Exclude client bundle.

01:19:45
<transcript>: There's a flag.

01:19:45
<transcript>: there's

01:19:47
<transcript>: there's a flag for it

01:19:49
<transcript>: Dynamic import.

01:19:49
<transcript>: i just

01:19:52
<transcript>: I just don't know if they kept it around. It was always experimental.

01:19:57
<transcript>: I use it in the public Dev.

01:20:05
<transcript>: It'll experiment.

01:20:08
<transcript>: X.

01:20:11
<transcript>: I don't know people.

01:20:11
<transcript>: only find

01:20:14
<transcript>: Only find me. Okay. If you do, I deserve it.

01:20:17
<transcript>: Experimental.

01:20:21
<transcript>: no

01:20:22
<transcript>: No.

01:20:22
<transcript>: is this public

01:20:24
<transcript>: Is this public on Dev? Yeah.

01:20:35
<transcript>: What is that called? That flag? Does anyone remember? Can you turn off JavaScript? I could.

01:20:39
<transcript>: I could. What? Link? Fred, kiss.

01:20:41
yeltrah_: What flag?

01:20:43
<transcript>: Exclude a module client side.

01:20:44
yeltrah_: What does it do?

01:20:44
<transcript>: Exper.

01:20:44
<transcript>: maybe

01:20:49
<transcript>: Maybe it's not. Maybe it doesn't say experimental. Maybe it's dangerous. I don't know.

01:20:51
<transcript>: There's a thing you can export.

01:20:53
fredkisss: @oetziofficial i think this is a good idea

01:20:54
<transcript>: I may have to just pull up my.

01:20:59
<transcript>: Oh here I can probably find.

01:20:59
<transcript>: it

01:21:00
<transcript>: It.

01:21:06
<transcript>: Does anyone use this? Am I the only person on Earth that uses it.

01:21:12
<transcript>: Let's go, let's see.

01:21:12
<transcript>: i'll just find it

01:21:13
fredkisss: The link to the Twitter threaf

01:21:15
<transcript>: I'll just find it in the code. Public, Dev packages, web.

01:21:19
fredkisss: *thread

01:21:19
<transcript>: It'd be under.

01:21:19
<transcript>: source

01:21:20
<transcript>: Source.

01:21:20
<transcript>: page

01:21:22
<transcript>: Pages.

01:21:25
<transcript>: Site.

01:21:25
<transcript>: paths

01:21:29
<transcript>: Paths. Here we go. Unstable. Runtime. Js. There it is.

01:21:32
<transcript>: So this just really.

01:21:33
<transcript>: Remove.

01:21:33
<transcript>: removes

01:21:35
<transcript>: Removes the.

01:21:35
<transcript>: react

01:21:39
<transcript>: React runtime altogether if you know you don't need it.

01:21:42
<transcript>: You can use this thing at least you used to be able to.

01:21:47
<transcript>: So we're gonna yarn build and yard start again.

01:21:49
<transcript>: This so works.

01:21:59
<transcript>: Oh, the link to the Twitter said thread. Y'all check here. Let's see. Is it this one.

01:21:59
<transcript>: yeah

01:22:00
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:22:01
nexxeln: woww i didn't know that

01:22:02
adamdotdev: https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/1586874929718362113

01:22:02
<transcript>: Here you go.

01:22:09
<transcript>: Yeah. Next. This is how I.

01:22:17
<transcript>: This is how I'm public Dev like your personal site on public on Dev like if we go to public live. Adam there is no JavaScript.

01:22:22
<transcript>: There's no react loaded on this thing, right? Like.

01:22:32
<transcript>: I think I have a little custom JavaScript tag that does like link preloading and it does this navigation and stuff, but it's like eight K. I think.

01:22:35
<transcript>: Are two K. Is it even smaller.

01:22:40
nexxeln: btw off topic question but how do you support custom domains?

01:22:42
<transcript>: Yeah. So see, this is like no React runtime, but it is a next day, a site. I'm just using that experimental flag.

01:22:56
<transcript>: Or that unstable flag, I guess. Okay, let's see if it did it. Did it remove it? Uhoh, can't do it anymore. Did they get rid of it? They might have gotten rid of it. A big release like this. I could see them saying, like, we're not gonna support that.

01:22:56
<transcript>: shoot

01:22:59
<transcript>: Shoot can't even opt out of it. Bummer.

01:23:02
<transcript>: Let me I'm certain some hot water.

01:23:02
<transcript>: i finally got

01:23:05
<transcript>: I finally got my phone working.

01:23:07
<transcript>: And.

01:23:07
<transcript>: so

01:23:09
<transcript>: So working. Yes.

01:23:16
<transcript>: How do you support custom domains? Like how do I support it in Next JS, next.

01:23:16
<transcript>: so i'll

01:23:17
<transcript>: So I'll.

01:23:21
<transcript>: Using Versailles. Has.

01:23:21
<transcript>: a

01:23:22
<transcript>: A.

01:23:22
<transcript>: like an

01:23:26
nexxeln: in public

01:23:26
<transcript>: Like an API for adding custom domains to your Versaille account.

01:23:26
<transcript>: i'm just noticing

01:23:32
<transcript>: I'm just noticing a couple of files. I didn't see Peca BA and Philip Cod thing for the follows.

01:23:37
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm creating custom domains in.

01:23:51
<transcript>: Versaille and doing it that way. I'll show you a little bit actually, when I get back, I'm going to take a quick break, but when I get back, I'll show you how we do custom domains and probably about Dev. Take a quick break. I'll be right back with coffee. Take coffee. Can't wait.

01:23:56
nexxeln: very cool

01:29:54
macukadam: Yellow! Howdy!

01:33:58
2dorkstv: morning, party people

01:34:24
<transcript>: Good morning.

01:34:24
<transcript>: tudor

01:34:28
<transcript>: Tudor's here and also welcome to Chat Muka dam.

01:34:30
<transcript>: Mukak.

01:34:33
swatee_: hello, how is it going?

01:34:37
<transcript>: Mukak Adam. Adam is at the end. Is it Mukaka.

01:34:42
developmentrobot: adam do you have any hookups for AWS Activate?

01:34:43
<transcript>: I'm a stop. I'm sorry I bought you everyone's name. Not just yours.

01:34:43
<transcript>: swat

01:34:48
<transcript>: Swati. Hello, it's going well, how are you? Thanks for the follow one.

01:34:48
<transcript>: while

01:34:50
<transcript>: While I was out.

01:35:06
<transcript>: Do you have any hookups for AWS, activate? I think everybody gets a device activate. Don't they feel like have a startup or a thing you're doing, you get it? I got it for a personal thing. I don't know. Like I've definitely gotten it before.

01:35:13
<transcript>: But I don't have any hookups necessarily. I guess.

01:35:15
<transcript>: I know a lot of people.

01:35:17
<transcript>: At AWS.

01:35:18
fredkisss: what is AWS Activate?

01:35:21
<transcript>: I gotta fix my my break.

01:35:21
<transcript>: my camera

01:35:24
<transcript>: My camera. My moving camera. It's moving way too fast.

01:35:26
<transcript>: It's taken off.

01:35:26
<transcript>: got

01:35:29
<transcript>: Gotta set some timing options or something.

01:35:30
swatee_: i just had a 4 hour lecture about data protection, urgh

01:35:34
<transcript>: Okay. So we were just playing with.

01:35:36
<transcript>: Let's go back over here.

01:35:41
<transcript>: 4 hours lecture about data protection.

01:35:43
<transcript>: Sounds awful.

01:35:49
<transcript>: Okay. So we just saw you can't.

01:35:50
<transcript>: opt out

01:36:06
<transcript>: Opt out anymore. In the Pages directory. Which kind of makes sense, I guess. Like this is not the same thing. It's a page in the Pages directory. I'm sorry. In the App directory. Like you can't. I wonder if I could do it on the layout. I could try. I don't think it's gonna work, but.

01:36:06
<transcript>: let's

01:36:08
<transcript>: Let's see if I'm gonna use.

01:36:12
<transcript>: It.

01:36:16
<transcript>: Let's put it in the layout and just just to be sure.

01:36:19
<transcript>: I don't think it's gonna matter but.

01:36:29
<transcript>: Yarn. Build yarn, start.

01:36:34
<transcript>: So next. If you're still here. I told you I'd look at this.

01:36:35
<transcript>: The.

01:36:35
<transcript>: so the

01:36:37
<transcript>: So the custom domains.

01:36:37
<transcript>: the way

01:36:39
<transcript>: The Way It works.

01:36:44
<transcript>: We use Gitstatus, get static paths.

01:36:45
nexxeln: i am here yes

01:36:46
<transcript>: To.

01:36:54
<transcript>: Open this thing up. Yeah. Github, Dev.

01:36:59
<transcript>: This way. I can like search and stuff.

01:37:05
fredkisss: there still needs to have some runtime Js because the routing does not reload the whole page and only children, this needs js to do the swapping

01:37:05
<transcript>: Vs. Code my old friend.

01:37:05
<transcript>: so

01:37:07
<transcript>: So.

01:37:07
<transcript>: get

01:37:08
<transcript>: Get.

01:37:13
<transcript>: Weaves, get says paths, or get static paths.

01:37:15
<transcript>: From here.

01:37:18
<transcript>: Go to definition.

01:37:22
<transcript>: No, that's not the definition.

01:37:25
<transcript>: Okay Lib API.

01:37:27
<transcript>: Lib.

01:37:27
<transcript>: api

01:37:28
<transcript>: Api.

01:37:32
<transcript>: How's this work? I'm trying to remember. It's been months.

01:37:35
nexxeln: no lsp on the website

01:37:38
<transcript>: Get.

01:37:38
<transcript>: static

01:37:39
<transcript>: Static pads.

01:37:39
<transcript>: is

01:37:41
<transcript>: Is something in here.

01:37:43
<transcript>: What.

01:37:44
<transcript>: Wait. What.

01:37:45
nexxeln: damn graphql

01:37:50
<transcript>: I see that get paths.

01:37:50
<transcript>: should be

01:37:53
<transcript>: Should be in Lib API. Right.

01:37:58
<transcript>: Am I looking right past it? Get pads.

01:38:05
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. I can do, like, search in here or something. I don't remember how to use vs. Code gift pads.

01:38:10
<transcript>: Fetcher, what the fetcher.

01:38:10
<transcript>: gets

01:38:28
<transcript>: Gets that pads on. Okay. So this is actually making a graph to open. Oh yeah, yeah. Because we store I guess that's dynamic. It's in the database. Like all the custom domains and users. Because every user like your username is the pro file like public Dev slash your username is your profile, but also you can have custom domains.

01:38:28
<transcript>: so we

01:38:30
<transcript>: So we store all those.

01:38:30
<transcript>: and we

01:38:32
<transcript>: And we use paths.

01:38:32
<transcript>: and then

01:38:44
<transcript>: And then these so under site is a dynamic directory. So we have the sites and then site dynamic path. And then paths. It's a catchall. So everything that hits.

01:38:44
<transcript>: here

01:38:50
<transcript>: Here is dynamic. And then we have a middleware here.

01:38:54
<transcript>: This middleware does some stuff.

01:38:54
<transcript>: to figure

01:39:00
<transcript>: To figure out if we need to rewrite into that site directory. I'm trying to remember what it does.

01:39:03
<transcript>: So.

01:39:03
<transcript>: get

01:39:08
<transcript>: Get path name go host name. So if it's like a custom domain, we find that out here.

01:39:16
<transcript>: Because you can have nested pages. Like if I were using a custom domain here you'd see this. But like.

01:39:21
<transcript>: The path can be nested like I have an about page.

01:39:21
<transcript>: in my personal

01:39:23
<transcript>: In my personal site here.

01:39:26
<transcript>: And that's like under.

01:39:28
<transcript>: My site. Right.

01:39:28
<transcript>: so

01:39:33
<transcript>: So anyway, it uses middleware. I should just said it uses middleware.

01:39:33
<transcript>: next

01:39:35
<transcript>: Next to.

01:39:35
<transcript>: navig

01:39:37
<transcript>: Navigate into.

01:39:37
<transcript>: this

01:39:41
<transcript>: This Sites directory, which is a dynamic.

01:39:41
<transcript>: ultimately

01:39:47
<transcript>: Ultimately, a dynamic catchall path to you that renders your page based on the data in the database.

01:40:00
<transcript>: But it does. It all with ISR so your pages are always instant like there's no the only client interactivity like I said, is like preloading images and links. And I have custom JS that does all that. So it's not using react.

01:40:00
<transcript>: so

01:40:12
<transcript>: So it's like five K or something, which I think for a personal site is what you should have, like, a personal site. Shouldn't have tons of JavaScript, right? What are you doing on your personal site? That you need two hundred K of JavaScript? Probably nothing.

01:40:14
laytanl_: will you also check out the @next/font and how it does the "swapping"?

01:40:23
cr4xr3v: mining

01:40:28
<transcript>: I think therein lies the problem I have with all of this narrative right now. Like I feel like everything's swinging toward, like, layoff. Stop picking on the next team. And the react team.

01:40:37
<transcript>: And I get it. We don't want to pick on them. It's not picking on them, though. If we just call out that like this release, isn't there.

01:40:37
<transcript>: it's

01:40:40
<transcript>: It's a bit half baked.

01:40:40
<transcript>: i don't think

01:40:40
nexxeln: so would you have to rebuild the site everytime someone makes a profile

01:40:45
<transcript>: I don't think that's like picking on them. And plus don't they pick on a lot of people.

01:40:52
<transcript>: I mean, hasn't the React team kind of, like been talking down to the entire webinar community for, like years.

01:40:52
<transcript>: is it okay

01:41:03
ghostyx101: yes thank you

01:41:06
ghostyx101: jfc

01:41:08
<transcript>: Is it okay if we, like, push back a little bit, like, hey, these aren't seem like they're ready, and maybe they're not ready. And that's okay. I guess they're saying it's not ready. Well, then don't have a big conference where you say it's already. And I know that wasn't react. That was the next. That was Racel. But the two are so inextricably linked at this point.

01:41:08
<transcript>: and i don't have

01:41:18
<transcript>: And I don't have any problems with that. Join forces. Be one thing. But like your messaging, it's hard to parse who's saying what? And I'm sorry for that.

01:41:18
<transcript>: i don't want to

01:41:32
<transcript>: I don't want to pick on anyone individual. I just think that collectively this is a bit of a fumble for Versaille. I'm gonna say it. I think it is. I don't know about react. It's hard to tell what the difference is between. Should react 18. Be further along. I have no idea.

01:41:34
<transcript>: Okay.

01:41:39
<transcript>: So would you have to rebuild the site every time someone makes a profile.

01:41:39
<transcript>: so next

01:41:39
fredkisss: React talking down ? For me it's the other way around

01:41:48
laytanl_: I have 70kb of js on my personal site NotLikeThis

01:41:48
<transcript>: So next. Yeah, we do on Demand ISR so the OnDemand revalidation invalidate their page. Whenever you save your page and you publish it.

01:41:48
<transcript>: in public

01:41:53
<transcript>: In public Dev. We do that. So we do on demand ISR to regenerate your page.

01:41:53
<transcript>: and

01:41:55
<transcript>: And then.

01:41:55
<transcript>: there are

01:41:56
nexxeln: ahh isr yeah makes sense

01:42:00
laytanl_: twittr is coming after me

01:42:03
<transcript>: There are some dynamic elements like this has stars. And if anyone ever started this repo again which you shouldn't don't use it. It's not good.

01:42:03
<transcript>: it's

01:42:06
<transcript>: It's probably say something in the README it's not don't use it.

01:42:06
<transcript>: but

01:42:10
<transcript>: But that's all dynamic and that's your ISR as well.

01:42:10
<transcript>: i don't think

01:42:15
<transcript>: I don't think GitHub. I'm not using like web hooks. I'm just. It's just a timer.

01:42:15
<transcript>: just like

01:42:20
<transcript>: Just like a standard ISR where it's just like based on.

01:42:20
<transcript>: some

01:42:22
<transcript>: Some time out.

01:42:23
ghostyx101: react community has some toxicity i havent seen in the vue or svelte community that alraedy says a lot

01:42:28
fredkisss: I've heard more negativity towards react for the past year than the other way around

01:42:29
<transcript>: Okay, let's see. I'm gonna catch a bunch of Uncheck because I've just been talking.

01:42:33
<transcript>: There sunny speed.

01:42:33
<transcript>: some

01:42:40
<transcript>: Some runtime JS because the routing does not reload the whole page and only children. This needs JSU slopping. Yeah, I know. That makes sense. Fred.

01:42:40
<transcript>: makes perfect

01:42:42
<transcript>: Makes perfect sense.

01:42:47
<transcript>: No. Lsp on the website.

01:42:52
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, yeah, no, sorry. Yeah. This was not the best way to navigate. Probably.

01:43:02
<transcript>: Well, you also check out the next font. And how does it how it does the swapping. Oh, yes, yes, please. Let's use next font. This is like.

01:43:02
<transcript>: again

01:43:06
<transcript>: Again something I'm very excited about and the reason.

01:43:06
<transcript>: if astro

01:43:12
<transcript>: If Astro had Next Slash font, if there was an Astrosl font that had the same features.

01:43:14
<transcript>: Probably. I've already left.

01:43:19
<transcript>: In Fact, this Astro have an image component. Ashton Astro image component.

01:43:23
<transcript>: Because they need to have that they do.

01:43:29
<transcript>: Experimental easy optimized images in your Astral project.

01:43:29
<transcript>: full

01:43:32
<transcript>: Full support of SSD builds and Serveside rendering.

01:43:34
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

01:43:34
<transcript>: what was i reading

01:43:34
nexxeln: i made this api recently https://gh-pinned.nxl.sh/api/user/adamelmore which gets you pinned repos, might be useful for you

01:43:36
<transcript>: What was I reading here.

01:43:45
nexxeln: had to make it cause egoist's went down

01:43:51
<transcript>: Mining. So would you have to rebuild the site? Oh, I already read that. Yes, thank you. React taking talking down for me. It's the other way around. Oh, really, Fred, you think the rest of the community's talking down to react? I mean, like in this very moment. Yes, but you don't. You don't think, like, over.

01:44:01
<transcript>: The last few years, it's been more of, like, react, trying to convince everybody that this is the way and they know what they're doing and.

01:44:03
<transcript>: I don't know.

01:44:03
<transcript>: latin you have

01:44:07
nexxeln: no the react hate is real

01:44:18
<transcript>: Latin, you have 70 JavaScript on our personal site, and that's fine. I mean, like, I don't think there's any rules here about how much is or isn't just it's just that things like Astro have come into the zeitgeist. They've entered into the conversation.

01:44:18
<transcript>: with

01:44:21
<transcript>: With very low JavaScript.

01:44:33
<transcript>: Approaches to building sites that don't need a lot of JavaScript. If you're building a spa like a rich web application and it does lots of rich application things. It feels like a native app.

01:44:33
<transcript>: then like

01:44:37
<transcript>: Then like that's where a lot of JavaScript makes more sense.

01:44:37
<transcript>: i guess

01:44:39
<transcript>: I guess, is what I'm saying.

01:44:43
caasidev: hello Mister!

01:44:54
fredkisss: @nexxeln Yeah this has been my experience

01:44:59
<transcript>: But if you're making like a brochure site or even ecommerce, I think it's funny that next JS and Remix are like the de facto ecommerce solutions when they use react and I just don't like is that needed? It doesn't really matter at the end of the day for ecommerce, I should just take that all back because no matter how good your framework is, if like a store builds their ecommerce site and Astro, they're gonna load all that market.

01:44:59
<transcript>: marketing crap

01:45:08
<transcript>: Marketing crap on it and it's gonna be slow anyway. They're gonna have, like 14 plugins that load JavaScript from all over the internet.

01:45:08
<transcript>: and

01:45:11
<transcript>: And it doesn't really matter what you give them, so I guess whatever.

01:45:18
<transcript>: Twitter is coming after you. What? Leighton? Twitter is coming after you? What are you talking about.

01:45:18
<transcript>: react community

01:45:26
<transcript>: React community has some toxicity I haven't seen in the view or smelled community that already says a lot. I've heard more negativity towards React for the past year than the other way around.

01:45:26
<transcript>: i made this ap

01:45:28
<transcript>: I made this API recently.

01:45:28
<transcript>: that thing

01:45:33
<transcript>: That thing which gets you pinned. Repos might be useful for you.

01:45:37
<transcript>: What? What is it new? I'm gonna I'm gonna open this.

01:45:41
<transcript>: X sends me a link, I open it, I'm a simple man.

01:45:51
<transcript>: What next? This mess. Oh, it's my pan repos. My pan repos. You said that I just ignored the words pinned. Repos. Had this.

01:45:53
<transcript>: Egoists went down.

01:45:55
<transcript>: Reactate Israel.

01:45:55
<transcript>: hello

01:45:58
<transcript>: Hello, Mr. Hello, Cassie. Dev.

01:46:05
<transcript>: Yeah. No. I think like, that's a good call. So over the last year, I would say the community has like.

01:46:22
<transcript>: Sort of gone away from React, at least on Twitter again, like in real usage, everybody doesn't react. But on Twitter, there's a bit of like, we're beyond that. Now we're done with React. We had our good times on React, and now we're ready to do the new thing.

01:46:22
<transcript>: i feel like

01:46:24
<transcript>: I feel like that started to turn over last year.

01:46:24
<transcript>: but

01:46:28
<transcript>: But I don't think like what I'm saying is.

01:46:28
<transcript>: can we

01:46:31
<transcript>: Can we not push back on a release being.

01:46:38
uberrick: Hey Adam, what you up to?

01:46:47
<transcript>: Not as good as it normally would be, like a Versaille release. Next. Yes. Release traditionally has been pretty good, pretty solid. And I feel like this one is pretty half baked. And then Turbo Pack is pretty Alpha. And they've said that like nuts. They didn't say it was Alpha.

01:46:47
<transcript>: but

01:46:50
caasidev: what's the new thing that is prod ready?

01:46:56
<transcript>: But with this whole JavaScript bundle size performance criticism is it not okay for the community to say, hey, this isn't very good.

01:47:16
nexxeln: they literally patched fest like wtf FeelsBadMan

01:47:16
<transcript>: Not very good yet. Just if you didn't know, it's not really good. I think it's okay for us to say that and not like now I see it's all over Twitter now, like, stop hating on these people. They're doing hard work. I get everyone's doing hard work. Who's not doing hard work, who's not working hard. They're not on the Internet, like people on the Internet, like, we're generally we're all working hard, right? So that.

01:47:16
<transcript>: 's not

01:47:22
nexxeln: fetch*

01:47:25
<transcript>: 's not an excuse. It's just calling out, this isn't very good yet. I don't think it's very good yet. That's okay to say right? Should I feel bad if I say that.

01:47:25
<transcript>: i don't know

01:47:27
<transcript>: I don't know hey, Rick.

01:47:32
<transcript>: What's the new thing that is prod, ready.

01:47:34
fredkisss: Do not fell bad

01:47:41
<transcript>: New thing that is prod, ready.

01:47:41
<transcript>: i mean i think

01:47:42
schrew: "We're all working hard" I type watching twitch at work

01:47:46
<transcript>: I mean, I think you could shift with Astro today, right? They've got a V one.

01:47:49
nexxeln: astro!

01:47:51
<transcript>: Again, we're talking about certain types of sites.

01:47:51
<transcript>: like

01:47:54
<transcript>: Like if you're building.

01:47:54
<transcript>: very

01:47:58
<transcript>: Very client heavy app and you know who you are if you're building that.

01:48:04
<transcript>: I want to use like Figma, but they are a whole, nother.

01:48:07
<transcript>: That's Wazam. And that's like compiling C.

01:48:12
<transcript>: But if you're building an app that is very front, front and heavy.

01:48:12
<transcript>: very react

01:48:24
<transcript>: Very reactive, very interactive. Whatever then like use react. And that's okay. Your users are there for a good time. They're there for a long time. They're not just hitting your site and bouncing.

01:48:24
<transcript>: like top of the

01:48:34
<transcript>: Like top of the funnel marketing pages and brochure sites and ecommerce. Even I think performance is more sensitive there and you shouldn't share 200 JavaScript in my opinion.

01:48:36
<transcript>: Okay.

01:48:42
caasidev: great tip, thanks!

01:48:45
<transcript>: We're all working hard. I type watching Twitch at work.

01:48:51
<transcript>: They did patch fetch which is interesting.

01:48:59
<transcript>: They did. They did do that. Okay, let's use the new next font thing. I am so excited about this. So I've been like, critical.

01:48:59
<transcript>: of this

01:49:01
<transcript>: Of this whole situation.

01:49:12
fredkisss: To be the devil's advocate, i think it is because they had to deliver something because of the (1) the conf, (2) react was lacking behind and people where not understanding well react 18, so they wanted to give people what they wanted...

01:49:15
<transcript>: But I'm also very excited about all the component library stuff like they made Next image better. We don't have to put anchor Tags in there. Next link. That's cool. And then next font. I haven't been excited about a thing.

01:49:15
<transcript>: in johnson

01:49:15
rollie042: Phrasing/tone matters too; "X isn't good" isn't particularly constructive, "The hello world bundle generated by X v12 is 1.5 larger than similar offerings like Y or Z"

01:49:16
<transcript>: In Johnson.

01:49:23
<transcript>: Like I am next font in a while, so let's use it. So this site right now.

01:49:31
<transcript>: Uses. Okay, we're done worrying about the client bundle. The client bundle is what it is. They still ship it regardless.

01:49:31
<transcript>: right yeah

01:49:35
<transcript>: Right? Yeah, they still ship it regardless, that's not my local.

01:49:37
uberrick: Vercel seem like they've put the pressure on themself just to announce it at their conf

01:49:42
<transcript>: Regardless of any experimental flag you put on there, it doesn't work anymore. You can't do unstable runtime JS that's fine.

01:49:42
<transcript>: and

01:49:46
<transcript>: And whether you have a page that's all sort of components are not.

01:49:46
<transcript>: you are getting

01:49:57
<transcript>: You are getting react. Okay. So maybe in the future they'll get smarter about that. And they'll say, oh, this path or this entire site doesn't use client components. Treat it more like.

01:49:57
teej_dv: next.js? more like past.js. remix is my new best friend

01:50:02
<transcript>: Just rendering HTML and don't ship the clients I don't know.

01:50:02
<transcript>: the point

01:50:11
<transcript>: The point that's being made here is great and that is if you're using navigation, you can benefit from the client side stuff, but do we need react to have like smooth.

01:50:11
<transcript>: navig

01:50:13
<transcript>: Navigation? I don't know.

01:50:17
<transcript>: The Big messages.

01:50:17
<transcript>: to be the

01:50:20
fredkisss: @Schrew About working hard, by looking up "server components" on twitter, most tweets are negative about it.

01:50:23
laytanl_: Is there any downside to disabling the runtime js on next12?

01:50:24
<transcript>: To be the devil, I think, is because they had to deliver something because of one. The conference to react was lacking behind.

01:50:36
uberrick: @teej_dv I thought you'd be more of a yew kind of guy

01:50:44
<transcript>: And people where we're not issuing, well, react 18. So they wanted to give people what they wanted. Yeah. No, I I get it. The whole, like, Conferencing is so tough because they plan those things well in advance. They have to get the venue and they have to do all the marketing assets and, like, hype it up. And they have all the onstage performance stuff they had to prepare and talks and all.

01:50:44
<transcript>: that like

01:50:47
<transcript>: That like there's a timing element. That's a nightmare.

01:50:47
<transcript>: and

01:50:51
<transcript>: And really I think this is the first next release where I felt like.

01:50:56
teej_dv: yes, i only write yew.rs. But that doesn't mean I don't want to start flamewards in js community to keep them stuck in the past

01:50:59
<transcript>: They announced the big release, and it was not what I expected, or it wasn't up to what I expect from them. So in that sense.

01:50:59
<transcript>: they've got a great

01:51:17
fredkisss: @Schrew So it's normal that some people say "we are working hard, don't send hate tweets to us".

01:51:19
<transcript>: They've got a great track record, and they deserve some Grace. I get it. These things happen. Some stuff wasn't ready, but you had to have the conference, and there you are. And it's not like it's terrible. Like the layouts, the app directory, like, all of that stuff seems to work. And people I think like that. That's great. I think it's just the performance thing that people have been really focused on. Think people like me were really expecting.

01:51:26
<transcript>: This to be something it wasn't. And it may never be. Maybe they'll always ship react. And you just see.

01:51:26
<transcript>: that

01:51:44
<transcript>: That if you build next JS apps, they're gonna have reactive them. That might be a fine tradeoff. And maybe I'm just need to shut up. Phrasingtone matters. Two X isn't good, isn't particularly constructive. The Hello World bundle generated by X version Twelve is one five times larger than similar off things like XYZ. That's a good point. Raleigh. Welcome to Chat. First of all.

01:51:52
<transcript>: And I probably said this thing isn't good and that's I shouldn't say that. That's not helpful. It's not constructive.

01:51:52
<transcript>: it

01:52:02
<transcript>: It's not even that. It's not good. My criticism is not even really criticism. It's just a different expectation. I had a different expectation.

01:52:02
<transcript>: for what

01:52:10
<transcript>: For what server components were than reality. And I don't know if that's because they're not done yet and it's going to become more what I expect.

01:52:10
<transcript>: or if this

01:52:13
uberrick: @teej_dv :D yeah true, theres no drama in Rust land just productive people

01:52:18
<transcript>: Or if this is just how it's always going to be. And I had a misunderstanding, and I was comparing it to something. Apples and oranges, something it was never going to be.

01:52:18
<transcript>: i have

01:52:21
<transcript>: I have been critical of like.

01:52:22
mindrage: Qwik kinda makes all js lazyloaded, even based on events, they dont really use react either. they also claim that copying the html purely and pasting another window would still work, they call it resumability

01:52:26
teej_dv: too busy fighting the compiler. can't fight other ppl @UberRick

01:52:31
fredkisss: The good part is that people who build things give constructive criticism on github issues & discussions and people on nextjs listen

01:52:33
<transcript>: Elements of Versaille that are higher level, not as the individual contributors, not of the people shipping all these features. Listen, I'm doing nothing. What am I doing? I'm sitting here drinking my fake coffee, coffee, and.

01:52:33
<transcript>: like

01:52:38
<transcript>: Like looking at their stuff. I made nothing so don't listen to me is what I'm trying to say.

01:52:52
elicxlive: Well I'm pretty sure the entire website is wrapped in a context now for layouts to work, so I don't think it'd be possible to do anything without react anymore

01:52:54
<transcript>: But like they have said, a certain precedent for releases go smoothly. We always deliver River Cell, and then just the last few weeks, it's been hard not to notice that's there's a little chip chip in their armor, a little Tink in their armor. I don't know.

01:53:03
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the follow Inferno Ripper. Okay, I'm gonna catch up on Chat verselle. Seems like they put the pressure on themselves just to announce it at their conference. Yeah, I think so.

01:53:09
<transcript>: Tee. Welcome Tee. Next to us. More like Past JS Remixes My new best friend. That's funny.

01:53:14
<transcript>: By looking at servant phones on Twitter. Most tweets are negative about it. Yeah.

01:53:16
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:53:24
<transcript>: Any downsides to disabling the runtime JS on next twelve.

01:53:41
<transcript>: You don't have react. So if you do anything in your page that needs the runtime, you will find it doesn't work, and sometimes even building public Dev. I got surprised a few times where it's like, oh, yeah, that would need that would need that would need react. So I have to rethink it now.

01:53:41
<transcript>: i

01:53:46
<transcript>: I patch it to like, do stuff manually in JavaScript that I wasn't planning to have to do.

01:53:46
uberrick: @teej_dv LUL very true and will continue for a life time ba dum tss

01:53:57
<transcript>: I thought you'd be more of a you kind of guy. Yes, I only write Urs, but that doesn't mean I don't want to start flame Horsecraft if you need to keep them stuck in the pads. That's so funny.

01:53:57
<transcript>: what is it like to be

01:53:58
<transcript>: What is it like to be.

01:53:58
<transcript>: stuff

01:54:03
teej_dv: That's a very good trait to have @UberRick

01:54:05
<transcript>: Stuff in Russ for the front end teach. I'd be very curious. I've never really watched that on stream. I should.

01:54:10
<transcript>: So it's normal.

01:54:10
<transcript>: some

01:54:17
<transcript>: Some people say we were working hard. Don't send hate tweets to it. Yeah. No, you're right, Fred. I've been too critical, I think.

01:54:22
<transcript>: I just think that like we're working hard isn't a very.

01:54:22
teej_dv: I've used yew.rs a few times and it's cool so far

01:54:40
<transcript>: It's. This is kind of like a non. It just doesn't help the conversation. I think everyone assumes everyone's working hard, or at least I hope so. Maybe I'm naive. I assume everyone involved in every project is working hard because that's what we all do. Like we work hard on stuff.

01:54:40
<transcript>: so

01:54:55
<transcript>: So I just think, like when people have criticisms of your stuff and they want to say, like, hey, this part could be better or this I notice this. This isn't what I expected. I think saying we're working hard, lay off of us is kind of like, I don't know.

01:55:05
<transcript>: I don't know. I don't know. This isn't me. I'm not the critic. I'm not critical guy. I just don't. I shouldn't even try because it's not me.

01:55:23
<transcript>: I'm just disappointed, you know, and that sounds like I'm not making like the joke. Like I'm not mad. I'm disappointed. I just really am disappointed because there's parts of the React server component stuff that I really look forward to and thought it was something it's not and was very excited to use in very specific projects.

01:55:23
<transcript>: and then

01:55:29
<transcript>: And then it's kind of a letdown. So I'm just let down. But if I said anything inflammatory.

01:55:31
<transcript>: And you're offended? Please let me know.

01:55:33
uberrick: @teej_dv LUL I might borrow that one

01:55:47
<transcript>: Drama in wrestling sounds nice quick kind of makes all JS lazyloaded even basic on events they don't really use react either. Also claim that copying the HTML purely and pacing into their window would still work resumability. Yeah I've heard.

01:55:47
<transcript>: i'm very curious

01:55:50
<transcript>: I'm very curious to play with it haven't yet.

<transcript>: Tsubzy find the compiler can't fight other people.

01:55:59
caasidev: heyup @teej_dv

01:56:04
teej_dv: LUL @UberRick

01:56:06
teej_dv: o/ cassidev

01:56:10
<transcript>: Good part is that people who build things give construction criticism on GitHub issues and discussions and people on nextdes listen. Oh, yeah. They're great to respond to feedback, and I get that I'm giving them zero time to, like, actually take a breath and sort it out before I'm just like, Wait, what? This isn't what.

01:56:18
<transcript>: It's just externally processing. That's what I'm doing. I'm just externally processing. That happens to be on the Internet a lot of times.

01:56:26
<transcript>: But I don't think I've been overly publicly critical. I think these streams, I don't consider this public, like, there's a hundred of us here hanging out.

01:56:26
<transcript>: is this public

01:56:27
<transcript>: Is this public.

01:56:28
fredkisss: You make good criticism, by reading all the tweets, i've noticed that they don't read even the doc, quick to bash to people without any research... it is tiring

01:56:36
teej_dv: LUL imagine ppl getting upset that you release something and it's not good yet -- tweeting AT them sucks, but tweeting ABOUT it I don't think is bad... They released it on the internet

01:56:40
<transcript>: Is cool. I've seen it. It looks like kind of like React components.

01:56:46
<transcript>: React World has been an emotional rollercoaster to say least.

01:56:47
2dorkstv: It's public, but you're amongst friends :D

01:57:03
<transcript>: You make good criticism by reading all the tweets. I've noticed that they don't read even the docs quick to bash to people without any research. It is. Yeah. And I should say like I'm not trying to excuse all of the bad internet behavior because there's a lot of it. And there's a lot of them in the GitHub issues.

01:57:09
<transcript>: That are doing the wrong. They're taking the wrong approach. There's a lot of people on Twitter taking the wrong approach.

01:57:09
<transcript>: there is

01:57:13
<transcript>: There is a wrong way to be publicly upset with something.

01:57:13
<transcript>: and

01:57:14
<transcript>: And.

01:57:14
<transcript>: i think

01:57:33
<transcript>: I think there's a lot of it happening right now, so not trying to dismiss that. Imagine people getting upset that you release something and it's not good yet. Tweeting at them. Sucks between about it. I don't think it's bad. They released it on the Internet. Yeah. I think that's a bit of the sense. A bit of the like spirit of where I'm coming from. Teach is like.

01:57:41
<transcript>: It's good to voice constructive criticism. It's healthy. It's helpful.

01:58:01
<transcript>: There's a line. But like if you're publishing stuff and you have a track record of delivering products that we all love and use, I think it's expected that if you do something that's maybe not up to your quality standards or what we've all come to expect that people are going to voice their frustration. I think that's just how the Internet works.

01:58:09
<transcript>: But you're amongst friends. It's a good way to end on it. Two dorks now I'm gonna actually do something. Let's do the React font thing. I mean next font.

01:58:14
<transcript>: Alright. So this didn't work.

01:58:16
<transcript>: That didn't work.

01:58:18
<transcript>: This didn't work either.

01:58:18
<transcript>: that was

01:58:23
<transcript>: That was an old thing you could do. Can't do it in the app directory. Good to know.

01:58:23
<transcript>: there

01:58:25
<transcript>: There's no way to my knowledge.

01:58:25
<transcript>: to

01:58:31
<transcript>: To exclude the React runtime in the app directory, you are stuck with it.

01:58:31
<transcript>: so if

01:58:41
<transcript>: So if you're building something and you're using the app directory, you better be okay with React being in your button. You should be. I mean if you're using next.

01:58:41
<transcript>: you're probably okay

01:58:52
fredkisss: thanks @teej_dv , that green screen was horrible

01:58:53
<transcript>: You're probably okay with React. You chose that world. I was doing the weird thing with Public Dev, where I was like, trying to have my cake and eat it, too. Like, I'm gonna use React, but I don't want to use React if you know what I mean.

01:58:59
teej_dv: agreed fred

01:59:00
uberrick: the redeems take a while to render. Are you using NextJS?

01:59:12
<transcript>: Yeah, the Hair Day thing. It doesn't work on a green screen. I thought about just turning off here today. Would you guys, would you be upset if I got rid of Hair Day? Since it doesn't work with my Chrome Wiki, I don't understand why it doesn't work. It's like a yellow color. I don't know why micromagy gets confused.

01:59:14
fredkisss: on public.dev you could have used astro to use "react' without using react LUL

01:59:20
<transcript>: Alright, let's see if they're already using it for first of all, font.

01:59:25
<transcript>: Next.

01:59:30
<transcript>: Font.

01:59:30
<transcript>: no

01:59:34
<transcript>: No do I need to escape? I do have teacher. I need to escape a forward slash.

01:59:45
<transcript>: Okay, so I don't think they're using next font. Let's use it. First of all, I'm gonna undo all the stuff that I just did.

01:59:45
<transcript>: i'm gonna

01:59:46
<transcript>: I'm gonna.

01:59:46
<transcript>: let's just

01:59:48
<transcript>: Let's just.

01:59:52
<transcript>: I don't want all those changes.

01:59:55
<transcript>: Except.

01:59:57
teej_dv: typical webdev streamer: "I'm going to undo all the stuff I did"

01:59:59
<transcript>: Except I do want.

02:00:01
teej_dv: smh

02:00:01
<transcript>: You want this one.

02:00:05
<transcript>: What the hell.

02:00:05
<transcript>: only changed

02:00:11
<transcript>: Only changed I want okay, now let's go to like the home page.

02:00:14
uberrick: learnt the other day you can find and replace using # instead of / to not have to escape the slash

02:00:16
<transcript>: Let's see. Ui page. Here we go. This is the landing page. Right.

02:00:19
<transcript>: I'm not running the Dev server.

02:00:24
<transcript>: Let's go here.

02:00:28
<transcript>: Landing page.

02:00:33
<transcript>: We're there. We're going to change this font to be some cool font, right.

02:00:33
<transcript>: they're using tail

02:00:36
<transcript>: They're using tailwind, right, tailwind.

02:00:40
<transcript>: Fonts.

02:00:40
<transcript>: okay

02:00:46
<transcript>: Okay. No fonts. So we're gonna do like this.

02:00:46
<transcript>: font

02:00:47
<transcript>: Font family.

02:00:54
<transcript>: We're gonna do the thing where you extend. How do you do that.

02:00:57
<transcript>: Over here.

02:01:03
<transcript>: Undo. All the stuff I did is that typical.

02:01:08
<transcript>: The redeem take a while to render oh no, it is next. Js.

02:01:08
<transcript>: it is

02:01:10
<transcript>: It is.

02:01:20
teej_dv: it's just cause of stream delay of ~5ish seconds

02:01:20
<transcript>: I'm public Dev. You could have used Astro to use react without using react. It's true, Fred. I could have if I had known about Astro.

02:01:20
<transcript>: i don't know

02:01:24
<transcript>: I don't know. In January, when I built it, I probably would have.

02:01:31
uberrick: haha I was trolling with the delay as I knew it was using Next

02:01:35
uberrick: next burn

02:01:39
<transcript>: Although the reason I use so again, I love Versaille. I love next JS the reason I built public Dev was because of a tweet that Guillermo or somebody tweeted about this whole platform starter kit that they had. It was like, hey, here's a way you can build.

02:01:39
<transcript>: a platform

02:01:49
<transcript>: A platform that builds sites for other people with Next. Yes, I was like, hey, I want to do that. I own the domain Public Dev. I want to use it for that. So I built public identity for that reason.

02:01:49
<transcript>: and

02:02:01
<transcript>: And there's some very features like Middleware that made it very easy to build a site builder in next JS. So I don't know, maybe I wouldn't have used Astro because I think there are some next to this features that are really great for doing something like that.

02:02:09
<transcript>: There's a file.

02:02:09
<transcript>: de

02:02:12
<transcript>: Delay. Five. A second delay.

02:02:12
<transcript>: on the

02:02:15
<transcript>: On the stream so.

02:02:15
<transcript>: hello

02:02:18
<transcript>: Hello from the past I don't know everything's from the past.

02:02:23
<transcript>: I'm talking to you all you are in the future. No, I'm in the future. I don't know.

02:02:23
<transcript>: i should

02:02:27
<transcript>: I should stop with this joke. This is not a good joke. What was I gonna do? I was gonna look up.

02:02:27
<transcript>: to

02:02:29
<transcript>: To.

02:02:29
<transcript>: extend

02:02:29
inferno_ripper: I know this is off topic, but how many full stack projects should I have on my portfolio before applying to jobs? @adamdotdev

02:02:31
<transcript>: Extend Font family.

02:02:31
<transcript>: thought

02:02:32
<transcript>: Thought.

02:02:38
<transcript>: Yeah, just like this.

02:02:38
<transcript>: that's what we want

02:02:40
<transcript>: That's what we want, right there.

02:02:44
<transcript>: Okay.

02:02:45
<transcript>: Fine.

02:02:48
<transcript>: You actually have to import it, though.

02:02:49
uberrick: I sometimes question how I come across just with words. I usually smile when trolling LUL

02:02:50
<transcript>: Like this.

02:02:55
<transcript>: What did I do.

02:02:58
<transcript>: Const.

02:02:59
<transcript>: constantly

02:03:01
<transcript>: Constantly require.

02:03:03
<transcript>: Hill and CSS.

02:03:06
<transcript>: Tailwind? Css.

02:03:09
<transcript>: Default C.

02:03:15
<transcript>: What did I do here? What's wrong.

02:03:15
bausmeier: @UberRick TIL

02:03:17
<transcript>: Hands.

02:03:25
<transcript>: What's that there's like a keystroke I can type that will like.

02:03:25
<transcript>: make the

02:03:29
<transcript>: Make the line below. Come up to this line. What is that.

02:03:33
bausmeier: J

02:03:40
<transcript>: In front of I know this off topic. First of all, welcome to Chat. I know this top topic, but how many full stack projects should I have on my portfolio before applying to Jobs? Anybody know the answer to that.

02:03:43
fredkisss: @inferno_ripper 1 project : your portfolio

02:03:44
<transcript>: Anybody.

02:03:47
uberrick: you change it to <leader>j/k I think

02:03:57
<transcript>: Jk oh, what did it do now? That did not do it.

02:03:57
<transcript>: later day

02:03:57
space_hiro: I had 1 project

02:03:58
<transcript>: Later day.

02:04:05
bausmeier: It's just "J"

02:04:05
<transcript>: Now I wanted to just, like, collapse this line. I'm just gonna do it the old busted way.

02:04:08
<transcript>: What do I do here.

02:04:08
<transcript>: font

02:04:13
<transcript>: Font family. Oh, it's like Font family. That's a key inside. Okay.

02:04:13
<transcript>: whoo we can

02:04:13
teej_dv: just "J"

02:04:15
<transcript>: Whoo? We can do this. We want to.

02:04:18
<transcript>: We want to wrap this.

02:04:18
<transcript>: with

02:04:21
<transcript>: With invents around.

02:04:21
uberrick: oh I thought you wanted to move the line up haha

02:04:23
<transcript>: Where's the.

02:04:25
<transcript>: Indent surround.

02:04:27
<transcript>: I can do that.

02:04:35
<transcript>: So why s AW would be create a new one Ysa bracket.

02:04:36
schrew: @inferno_ripper I'd start applying before working on a portfolio, then work on portfolio if you aren't getting interviews. Repeat until job is acquired

02:04:37
<transcript>: Ysa bracket.

02:04:37
<transcript>: we did it

02:04:38
<transcript>: We did it.

02:04:38
<transcript>: no i did

02:04:40
<transcript>: No. I did in the wrong spot.

02:04:44
<transcript>: We want to do that here. So ysaw.

02:04:44
<transcript>: ys

02:04:46
<transcript>: Ysa, what.

02:04:46
<transcript>: it's like

02:04:49
<transcript>: It's like everything to the end of the line.

02:04:55
<transcript>: Except for the comment. No, the comma could save and it needs to be inside the comma. Why.

02:04:55
<transcript>: s

02:04:56
<transcript>: S.

02:05:02
<transcript>: And then two the comma like YS to the comma.

02:05:02
<transcript>: oh it worked

02:05:05
<transcript>: Oh, it worked. No, it didn't. Oh, there's a comma there. Oops.

02:05:09
space_hiro: my project wasn't even completed that landed  me an internship and a few jobs

02:05:10
inferno_ripper: okay, thanks

02:05:12
<transcript>: Okay, so to the end of the line just like YS dollars song.

02:05:12
<transcript>: that works

02:05:14
<transcript>: That works kind of.

02:05:14
<transcript>: we just need

02:05:14
teej_dv: you should just use "I" and "A" for this one I think haha

02:05:18
<transcript>: We just need the add another comma, right.

02:05:22
<transcript>: I'm not doing prettier on this.

02:05:22
<transcript>: guess

02:05:24
<transcript>: Guess I'm not.

02:05:27
<transcript>: Font Family. Sands. Oh, There we go.

02:05:27
<transcript>: proximon no

02:05:31
<transcript>: Proximon Nova is not the one. It's not the one we want.

02:05:37
<transcript>: We want what? Let's do let's find a cool font. Google font.

02:05:40
<transcript>: So theoretically.

02:05:40
<transcript>: when we

02:05:43
<transcript>: When we Where are they.

02:05:44
<transcript>: When we.

02:05:47
uberrick: @teej_dv he loves the vim surrounds plugin too much LUL

02:05:53
<transcript>: Use a font here we're gonna not have to use optional anymore.

02:05:53
<transcript>: and

02:05:55
<transcript>: And we're gonna be able to.

02:06:00
<transcript>: Find something very clearly.

02:06:00
<transcript>: like this

02:06:05
<transcript>: Like this and poor story. That one's very clearly different.

02:06:07
<transcript>: It shouldn't do layout, shift.

02:06:07
<transcript>: that's what

02:06:09
<transcript>: That's what I'm. That's what I'm hearing.

02:06:09
<transcript>: so

02:06:13
nexxeln: Albert Sans

02:06:19
<transcript>: So where do we import this? I guess I need to know the font family. It's gonna be just poor story, probably. Okay. So we're gonna put that in there. And then we need to go into.

02:06:19
<transcript>: what

02:06:21
<transcript>: What.

02:06:21
<transcript>: we need to go

02:06:24
<transcript>: We need to go into, like, our top level.

02:06:24
<transcript>: layout

02:06:25
<transcript>: Layout.

02:06:25
<transcript>: or

02:06:28
<transcript>: Or page. We'll do the layout.

02:06:28
<transcript>: okay

02:06:34
<transcript>: Okay. So here we're gonna say import poor story.

02:06:36
<transcript>: From.

02:06:39
<transcript>: Next Slash font.

02:06:41
<transcript>: It's not.

02:07:56
<transcript>: It's just J. Oh, capital J does what I'm looking for. So if I want to like, yes, that's what I was looking for. Thank you. Can't wait till I know all this Vin stuff and I don't have to ask every time I want to do something.

02:07:56
<transcript>: so i'm gonna

02:07:58
teej_dv: "J" for Join

02:08:02
<transcript>: So I'm gonna move line up. Yeah. No. Sorry. Yeah. I did that with my like I made it where I can do like that. To move lines around.

02:08:10
<transcript>: You should just use I and a for this one. I think. Oh, what was I doing? Tease. I missed something.

02:08:10
<transcript>: i love the

02:08:13
<transcript>: I love the vimsurrounds. Oh, yeah, I should have you right.

02:08:20
<transcript>: I just. I want to get the invent surround thing to be like natural feeling. It still doesn't feel natural. So I want to practice it more.

02:08:28
<transcript>: Install next font. Okay.

02:08:28
<transcript>: j for

02:08:31
<transcript>: J for join that makes so much sense.

02:08:31
<transcript>: so i

02:08:32
teej_dv: yeah, it should be natural for selections where it would be natural to use LUL

02:08:37
<transcript>: So I have to do install yarn in install at next.

02:08:37
<transcript>: i thought

02:08:38
inferno_ripper: what are you working on?

02:08:39
<transcript>: I thought it was just.

02:08:45
teej_dv: instead of forced into every time you want to add braces LUL

02:08:45
<transcript>: I thought it was just built in. I don't know why.

02:08:45
<transcript>: this makes sense

02:08:52
<transcript>: This makes sense. Next image is just built in, right. I guess this makes sense because it's kind of probably big. Kind of probably.

02:08:54
<transcript>: Kind of probably big.

02:08:54
<transcript>: i mean it's

02:08:58
<transcript>: I mean it's probably pretty big if it's got all the fonts in it.

02:09:05
<transcript>: Underscore story. There we go. Okay, poor story is our font. And now how do we use it.

02:09:14
<transcript>: Class name. Inter. Class name. Oh, interesting. So this won't be a tailwind thing. It'll just be.

02:09:14
<transcript>: last

02:09:16
<transcript>: Last name equals.

02:09:22
<transcript>: Oh, I have to let instantiate it. This is weird. So.

02:09:24
<transcript>: I'm just gonna say Con.

02:09:24
<transcript>: font

02:09:26
<transcript>: Font.

02:09:26
<transcript>: or custom

02:09:28
<transcript>: Or Custom Font equals.

02:09:35
<transcript>: Or story that feels weird. There's no new. It's just texted one argument.

02:09:39
<transcript>: Options.

02:09:42
<transcript>: Do that.

02:09:45
<transcript>: Nope. Need something.

02:09:50
<transcript>: What is the syntax.

02:09:57
<transcript>: Are you gonna type that is not assignable type. So there's some required things. I have to say a weight.

02:09:57
<transcript>: okay

02:09:59
<transcript>: Okay.

02:10:01
<transcript>: Wait.

02:10:01
<transcript>: four hundred

02:10:02
<transcript>: 400.

02:10:04
<transcript>: What.

02:10:14
<transcript>: It has to be a number, and it has to be the number 400. Okay, ysaw.

02:10:20
<transcript>: You see that? You see how I did that with the invents around. Okay. Custom font.

02:10:20
<transcript>: custom

02:10:23
<transcript>: Custom bot dot.

02:10:25
<transcript>: Collapse name.

02:10:25
<transcript>: okay

02:10:26
<transcript>: Okay.

02:10:30
<transcript>: So it doesn't use tailwind.

02:10:31
uberrick: @teej_dv do you ever use the surrounds plugin? I've resisted so far

02:10:33
<transcript>: Appears.

02:10:35
<transcript>: Is okay.

02:10:35
<transcript>: if

02:10:40
<transcript>: If you can't use a variable font, you'll need to specify a weight. Oh, they just said that. Okay.

02:10:43
<transcript>: So then I guess I need to.

02:10:47
<transcript>: Oh, you can specify subsets that's cool.

02:10:52
<transcript>: I guess I need to just remove the tailwind thing.

02:10:54
<transcript>: After all that.

02:11:02
<transcript>: Thing. I just did all that stuff. I just did another thing that web does say a lot. I heard.

02:11:06
<transcript>: What's did it work.

02:11:06
<transcript>: work did it work

02:11:08
<transcript>: Work? Did it work, did it work.

02:11:14
<transcript>: That's not the custom font. Oh, I'm not running a desk server, so that's important.

02:11:22
<transcript>: A handspainted, this mug.

02:11:24
<transcript>: You could say I made it.

02:11:24
<transcript>: i made it

02:11:27
<transcript>: we

02:11:44
<transcript>: Operator Mono. Also, welcome to Chat Nesta, makunan.

02:11:51
<transcript>: Should be natural for selections where it would be natural to use.

02:12:00
<transcript>: What do we working on? We're working on. We're playing with Next 13. So we're just trying to play that. Oh, yes, the new custom font stuff. Wait, that's not it.

02:12:54
<transcript>: Let's go to the network tab.

02:12:54

02:13:52
<transcript>: What did it say.

02:13:56
<transcript>: Something failed.

02:13:58
laytanl_: Other console

02:13:58
<transcript>: Don't see it when I issue.

02:14:00
<transcript>: No.

02:14:03
laytanl_: LUL

02:14:10
teej_dv: nvim window "Failed to find font..."

02:14:11
<transcript>: Okay, what is for story.

02:14:14
<transcript>: I thought I removed that.

02:14:21
<transcript>: Try really.

02:14:25
teej_dv: it's old output I think

02:14:27
joshuajebaraj: how do you generate live transcription for the videos that you post in twitter

02:14:28
teej_dv: ?

02:14:30
<transcript>: Restart that's like at the beginning.

02:14:30
<transcript>: oh the next font

02:14:32
<transcript>: Oh, the next font.

02:14:32
<transcript>: poor

02:14:38
<transcript>: Poor Story has no selective subsets. Please specify subsets in the function Call or in your next config. Otherwise no fonts will be preloaded.

02:14:38
<transcript>: ah aha

02:14:41
<transcript>: Ah, AHA, we gotta say Latin.

02:14:42
wuelnerdotexe: @teej_dv omg, the Neovim's goat ðŸ˜Ž

02:14:43
<transcript>: Okay.

02:14:44
uberrick: Poor story bro

02:14:46
<transcript>: Let's do this.

02:14:51

02:14:57
<transcript>: Subsets? Yeah.

02:15:03
<transcript>: Okay.

02:15:10
<transcript>: Poor story bro.

02:15:15
<transcript>: How do you generate live transcription for the videos that you post in Twitter.

02:15:16
teej_dv: <3 o/ wuelner

02:15:28
<transcript>: Great question. I use Premiere Pro. It has an excellent transcription feature. You can transcribe and add Captions and Premiere Pro, and it works amazingly. I usually have to correct a couple words, but it's pretty accurate.

02:15:37
<transcript>: I've used so many transcription services and APIs over my last five years, ten years.

02:15:48
<transcript>: Do you work.

02:15:52
ovct_: What theme do you use in your terminal?

02:15:57
<transcript>: Still Loading.

02:16:01
<transcript>: Maybe. No, it's loaded.

02:16:06
<transcript>: Still.

02:16:06
<transcript>: fill

02:16:09
<transcript>: Filled if I'm font overrun values for font poor story.

02:16:16
<transcript>: Sorry. A variable font.

02:16:20
<transcript>: I think for the ball, Samuka.

02:16:24
<transcript>: Try a variable font.

02:16:27
wuelnerdotexe: @ovct_ dracula, maybe ?? is Halloween haha

02:16:31
<transcript>: Variable.

02:16:31
<transcript>: here we go

02:16:33
<transcript>: Here we go.

02:16:36
owencodes: HeyGuys

02:16:37
<transcript>: It's got to be very obviously a different font so I can tell.

02:16:44
<transcript>: Like I want a crazy font.

02:16:44
wuelnerdotexe: @teej_dv BegWan

02:16:45
ovct_: hahaha, it's true

02:16:45
<transcript>: Come with this one.

02:16:45
<transcript>: dancing

02:16:48
<transcript>: Dancing script. Okay.

02:16:55
<transcript>: Dancing script? Oops.

02:17:02
<transcript>: We don't need to say subsets.

02:17:14
<transcript>: On Google has no selective subsets. I thought I didn't need to if it was variable.

02:17:14
<transcript>: but you

02:17:15
<transcript>: But you said I don't need to.

02:17:19
<transcript>: Are you doing me like that.

02:17:23
<transcript>: Oh, it worked.

02:17:23
<transcript>: okay so we

02:17:27
<transcript>: Okay. So we just. We found a bug with the first font we chose.

02:17:27
<transcript>: that did not

02:17:31
<transcript>: That did not work. This one is objectively. Terrible.

02:17:34
<transcript>: At least for these use. Case.

02:17:38
<transcript>: But it worked and now let's see if.

02:17:38
<transcript>: can i

02:17:43
<transcript>: Can I get like a swap? What I want to know is.

02:17:45
<transcript>: Let's see here.

02:17:45
<transcript>: i'm gonna find

02:17:48
<transcript>: I'm gonna find on the HTML let's see.

02:17:52
<transcript>: Where would it be? Where would the.

02:17:58
<transcript>: It be in the here we go next next month.

02:18:02
<transcript>: You see the name of this.

02:18:05
fredkisss: up there in the html

02:18:14
<transcript>: Node Model's Next Font Google Target CSS Path App Layout TSX Import Dancing script arguments I think that's the one I want. I'm looking for the CSS to see if it's using optional or what it's using right.

02:18:17
<transcript>: Open a new tab. There we go.

02:18:20
<transcript>: Font is play, optional.

02:18:22
<transcript>: Wait it's using optional.

02:18:26
<transcript>: Okay. So I totally misrepresented what this thing does.

02:18:26
<transcript>: if

02:18:28
<transcript>: If it's using optional, then that means.

02:18:32
<transcript>: Okay. I want to push this up, actually.

02:18:32
<transcript>: and see

02:18:34
<transcript>: And see on Versaille if I can get it to know.

02:18:34
<transcript>: the font

02:18:36
<transcript>: The Font in time.

02:18:40
<transcript>: If it's optional, that means we should sometimes see the wrong font.

02:18:40
<transcript>: oh

02:18:42
<transcript>: Oh.

02:18:42
<transcript>: oops

02:18:43
<transcript>: Oops.

02:18:46
<transcript>: I don't know that was about.

02:18:46
<transcript>: let's see

02:18:47
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:18:52
<transcript>: So we've just changed what we added. Next font.

02:18:55
kaszanas: Yo sup

02:18:55
<transcript>: Tail end. Yeah. Layout. Okay.

02:18:57
laytanl_: Can't you throttle in the devtools?

02:18:58
<transcript>: Let's try this.

02:19:11
nestamakunen: @teej_dv what's the schedule Stream this week ?

02:19:15
<transcript>: Question is can we get it to not use our font? Because I thought I thought it would use Swap. But they use that thing to make sure you never get laughs up CSS property.

02:19:21
<transcript>: It is Dracula. Yes.

02:19:30
<transcript>: Hello, Cuz Kazana's. Welcome to chat.

02:19:30
<transcript>: i think for

02:19:36
<transcript>: I think for the follows Nestamakunan and Lord Ruffy and go right.

02:19:36
<transcript>: and i don't know

02:19:40
<transcript>: And I don't know if I saw Samuka. I think I saw some Mocha.

02:19:46
<transcript>: Can't you throttle in the Dev tools? Oh, that's a good idea.

02:19:46
<transcript>: granite

02:19:46
kaszanas: How do you open the buffer tab and terminal at the same time

02:19:47
<transcript>: Granite.

02:19:53
<transcript>: Great idea. How do you open the buffer tab and turn on at the same time.

02:19:57
<transcript>: Oh, I'm using toggle term.

02:19:59
<transcript>: That you mean this guy.

02:20:01
<transcript>: Toggle term.

02:20:05
kaszanas: ahhh yeah

02:20:09
<transcript>: Depth. Let's see.

02:20:19
<transcript>: Still building. Okay.

02:20:23
<transcript>: Yeah. Let's see if we can throw it.

02:20:26
<transcript>: See if we can do some throttling Whoa.

02:20:29
<transcript>: I'm not running it right now.

02:20:32
kaszanas: gotta look into that as I am starting my nvim adventure

02:20:33
ovct_: Have you ever used tmux?

02:20:37
<transcript>: Can we throttle this thing.

02:20:45
<transcript>: Where is that.

02:20:47
<transcript>: Not performance.

02:20:53
<transcript>: It's just on the car. Thanks for the follow somebody. Thanks for volderio.

02:20:56
<transcript>: What am I looking for.

02:21:05
<transcript>: Don't tell me, don't tell me I can find it.

02:21:12
darioespdev: hi!

02:21:12
<transcript>: Network. It's on the network to write. No, yeah, here we go.

02:21:15
<transcript>: This thing. Throttling.

02:21:19
fredkisss: you should also disable cache

02:21:19
<transcript>: So you slow. 3g. Let's try again.

02:21:26
<transcript>: Aha, look at that.

02:21:33
<transcript>: No custom font. So this is not quite as great as I thought it was.

02:21:37
<transcript>: Maybe there's an option. We'll check the docs. Maybe.

02:21:37
<transcript>: maybe there

02:21:40
<transcript>: Maybe there's an option. Welcome to Chat. Dartio.

02:21:40
<transcript>: have you ever

02:21:43
<transcript>: Have you ever used tmux. I'm. Using it right now.

02:21:44
laytanl_: Thats a bummer

02:21:51
<transcript>: So let's see if next font if there's an option.

02:21:53
<transcript>: optional

02:21:54
<transcript>: Optional.

02:21:55
laytanl_: was excited for how you described it

02:21:57
<transcript>: Swap.

02:21:57
<transcript>: so

02:22:03
<transcript>: So how do I understand what the big instance on zero layout shift is? There's never layout shift with optional.

02:22:03
<transcript>: you don't get lay

02:22:13
<transcript>: You don't get layout shift with optional because it doesn't load if it doesn't get there in time. Size adjust Properties is new font system allows also allows you conveniently used all group on forms of Privacy minds.

02:22:14
<transcript>: Okay.

02:22:21
<transcript>: This means you can optimally load web fonts with zero layout shift.

02:22:24
<transcript>: I don't understand.

02:22:38
<transcript>: So Google fonts are automatically subset. This reduces the size of.

02:22:43
nexxeln: maybe in build it will use swap?

02:22:44
<transcript>: Global you can do it for all fonts that's cool.

02:22:51
<transcript>: Preloading reusing fonts.

02:22:52
nexxeln: try build and start

02:22:56
<transcript>: I'm so confused.

02:22:56
<transcript>: maybe

02:22:57
laytanl_: it even says it uses 'size-adjust' so this does not make sense

02:23:04
<transcript>: Maybe in build it will use swap. Maybe. Yeah. Well, we also just deployed it so I can test the deployed version if it's done.

02:23:04
<transcript>: but yeah

02:23:10
fredkisss: you can add a key : 'swap' to use swap

02:23:10
<transcript>: But yeah, I could do yarn build locally. Yeah, it's done. Okay. So here is my.

02:23:14
<transcript>: Okay. So it got the best.

02:23:14
<transcript>: with no thr

02:23:19
<transcript>: With no throttling on the deployed version. Let's see if it used swap. That's what I was gonna do.

02:23:23
<transcript>: Where was that I was looking for.

02:23:25
fredkisss: *a key  display: 'swap'

02:23:25
<transcript>: Css files.

02:23:29
<transcript>: Oh, this might be harder to find oh, there it is.

02:23:41
nexxeln: still optional :(

02:23:43
<transcript>: That was awesome. That was very comedic in a way that I can't be that funny because I'm not very funny. But I was like, I wonder where it is, and I click, and then there it is. That's funny to me. I don't know. Dancing, script, optional, optional.

02:23:48
owencodes: LUL

02:23:48
<transcript>: It's all out optional. Oh, but look at this dancing script. Fallback.

02:23:50
<transcript>: Error.

02:23:53
<transcript>: A sent override.

02:23:53
<transcript>: what is this

02:23:57
<transcript>: What is this? I feel like this is the size adjust thing. See.

02:24:00
<transcript>: So.

02:24:00
<transcript>: what

02:24:03
<transcript>: What I don't understand is, why do all of that.

02:24:09
<transcript>: Why do all of that if you're optionally Loading the good font.

02:24:09
<transcript>: does anyone

02:24:11
<transcript>: Does Anyone understand.

02:24:15
<transcript>: You can add a key swap to use swap. You can.

02:24:18
<transcript>: Oh, Fred, you can.

02:24:23
teej_dv: "why do all of that" - the question I ask every time I do anything on the web

02:24:27
<transcript>: I didn't see that in the Docs. I guess these aren't the dot. Well, yeah, these are the docks, but I didn't see it.

02:24:27
<transcript>: maybe i'll

02:24:28
fredkisss: https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/components/font#nextfontgoogle

02:24:29
<transcript>: Maybe I'll go to their repo and see if.

02:24:32
<transcript>: Next font.

02:24:34
fredkisss: In the beta docs

02:24:38
<transcript>: I'll try it. We'll just try adding that key. But I want to see.

02:24:41
<transcript>: Where is it? On GitHub.

02:24:46
<transcript>: I was probably like in a Mona repo. Right.

02:24:49
<transcript>: Next JS.

02:24:53
<transcript>: Next JS I don't know.

02:25:00
<transcript>: Font.

02:25:05
bausmeier: It's in the full docs as well https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/font#nextfontgoogle

02:25:10
<transcript>: Zero shift and.

02:25:10
<transcript>: it's this

02:25:16
<transcript>: It's. This. Let's just do, let's just do it. This is dumb. Why am I trying to find it on the web page when I can just do it here.

02:25:16
<transcript>: you're saying

02:25:18
<transcript>: You're saying there's a swap here.

02:25:24
<transcript>: No, not here. Thanks. Somewhere else.

02:25:28
<transcript>: But where would that be.

02:25:32
<transcript>: The Beta docs. Oh, here we go.

02:25:33
laytanl_: display

02:25:35
<transcript>: Thank you.

02:25:36
fredkisss: display: 'swap'

02:25:39
<transcript>: It's in the full docs as well. Okay. So I'm just bad at seeing things.

02:25:49
<transcript>: It is bad at seeing the things. Display swap. Where is this now? Font function arguments. Oh, display.

02:25:53
<transcript>: Display.

02:25:57
<transcript>: Whoop? Okay, now we're talking.

02:26:04
<transcript>: Now there should be no layout shift even though it's gonna get the new font.

02:26:05
xypher66: id imagine its hard to see much of anything with those glasses

02:26:07
<transcript>: Oh, I saw layout shift. I don't know about you.

02:26:10
<transcript>: Like a lot of it.

02:26:13
<transcript>: Again, to try not to be critical.

02:26:13
<transcript>: i just

02:26:17
<transcript>: I just I'm you say no layout shift. I'm expecting.

02:26:20
<transcript>: No. Layout shift. Right.

02:26:24
<transcript>: Imagine it's hard to see much of anything with those glasses.

02:26:29
<transcript>: I didn't know I had the min.

02:26:39
<transcript>: So the refresh now it's not still doing something. What is it doing? Okay, the 3G.

02:26:39
<transcript>: may be too slow

02:26:41
<transcript>: May be too slow.

02:26:45
<transcript>: Oh, getting another Hydration issues? I don't know.

02:26:49
<transcript>: Let's I want to deploy this to.

02:26:49
benanna19: layout shift - "i do not think that word means what you think it means ðŸ˜…"

02:26:54
<transcript>: Or we'll just do yarn build and yarn start.

02:26:54
<transcript>: we'll just do locally

02:26:55
<transcript>: We'll just do locally.

02:27:02
<transcript>: Yeah, maybe I miss. I could have missed something up here.

02:27:02
<transcript>: so i

02:27:10
<transcript>: So I don't want to jump to too many conclusions. It's like I'm trying to find a way to be disappointed here. I'm not. I want to be excited about next font.

02:27:10
<transcript>: but also

02:27:11
<transcript>: But also.

02:27:11
<transcript>: if it

02:27:12
laytanl_: "I don't want to be critical but this does not do what it says"

02:27:20
<transcript>: If it isn't as great as I thought it was, I feel less bad using other frameworks because it's gonna be really hard to use other frameworks as long as next font exists.

02:27:26
<transcript>: Okay.

02:27:35
teej_dv: so you can't use next fonts in other projects?

02:27:35
<transcript>: So we're still in slow, three G. I might bump that up because slowly takes forever.

02:27:40
<transcript>: Didn't do it. Oh, did it lay out shift.

02:27:46
<transcript>: We'll skip it more room. I think it's the nav. I think it's like lined breaks.

02:27:46
<transcript>: i don't think they can probably

02:27:51
<transcript>: I don't think they can probably account for that, right? I bet there's no line breaks in those now.

02:27:53
nexxeln: prolly not @teej_dv

02:27:55
<transcript>: Probably be no layout shift. Yeah. Look at that. So that's nice.

02:27:55
<transcript>: at least

02:27:56
nexxeln: which is sad

02:28:02
<transcript>: At least under those conditions. No layout shift. They managed to make the Fallback font the same.

02:28:08
<transcript>: Size as this font. Right. That's pretty clever. It's clever.

02:28:10
laytanl_: Ah oke thats oke I guess

02:28:11
teej_dv: how can you not use fonts everywhere LUL I literally do not understand the internet

02:28:22
<transcript>: One more time for those in the back. There's the default and then slopped in no, no layup shift. But what it doesn't accommodate is now here we have line breaks. This thing is very narrow.

02:28:22
<transcript>: and

02:28:30
<transcript>: And when we do it here, it's like it doesn't. One of the fonts doesn't break the same on new lines.

02:28:30
<transcript>: there's lashes

02:28:35
<transcript>: There's lashes. So it's not perfect. It's probably as good as you can get.

02:28:39
<transcript>: Right with CSS, I guess. Like.

02:28:44
<transcript>: I don't know.

02:28:48
<transcript>: Container queries you can do some other fun stuff.

02:28:48
<transcript>: maybe

02:28:51
<transcript>: Maybe to make this.

02:28:51
<transcript>: not

02:28:54
bausmeier: Is this the same sort of thing as Capsize? https://seek-oss.github.io/capsize/

02:28:59
sockthedev: finish the stable diffusion thing?

02:29:03
<transcript>: Not do this, not break. I don't know. There's probably it's like a it feels like an app specific problem. Like my app happens to have these very narrow NAV. Like this is probably something you can avoid. Right.

02:29:03
<transcript>: so i can practice

02:29:05
<transcript>: So I can practice. I can avoid this issue.

02:29:08
shaaah: make it  a sliding menu

02:29:13
wuelnerdotexe: Will I be the only one who sees The Primeagen with airs of Freddy Mercury? neryadSure

02:29:14
<transcript>: It's just the way this site's designed. It has this really narrow NAV with long words.

02:29:14
<transcript>: that line

02:29:15
<transcript>: That line, break.

02:29:15
<transcript>: okay

02:29:16
growinarg: hahah nice mstaches!

02:29:17
<transcript>: Okay.

02:29:17
<transcript>: i'm convinced

02:29:20
<transcript>: I'm convinced I think next bond is good.

02:29:29
<transcript>: Think it's good and that they did that for all the Google fonts is really cool. Like that. They've calculated all that and done all the what is it called font.

02:29:31
<transcript>: Facing whatever it was.

02:29:33
sockthedev: prime is heavy on the mercury vibe

02:29:35
<transcript>: This is good.

02:29:39
<transcript>: Here. It's right here.

02:29:39
<transcript>: size

02:29:40
<transcript>: Size adjust.

02:29:41
sockthedev: i always see freddy when i see him

02:29:43
laytanl_: can you use a paid font?

02:29:48
<transcript>: Like they did this for all the fonts. I'm happy I can just use them. I just barrel import them.

02:29:50
<transcript>: Feels good.

02:29:50
schrew: Yearning for kerning

02:29:54
<transcript>: Can use a paid font. You can use custom fonts.

02:30:01
<transcript>: Excuse me? You can says you can use custom bonds. I didn't try.

02:30:04
<transcript>: Where is that.

02:30:09
teej_dv: schrew, do you mean keming?

02:30:11
<transcript>: Local font so font local and such as the source of your local font file.

02:30:15
<transcript>: So you can have your own font file just like you did before.

02:30:20
<transcript>: And I guess it does all well, it can do the size adjust stuff for that, right.

02:30:23
sockthedev: i just come here to make sure dax isn't slacking on the new SST CLI

02:30:33
<transcript>: We recommend using variable fonts. So what? I don't know what this. I guess it does the preloading for you, but there's no way that could do the what you want to test it. Do we want to test it? There's no way that could do the size adjust stuff, right.

02:30:38
<transcript>: What voodoo would that be if they could calculate that dynamically.

02:30:40
laytanl_: It might read the metadata of it

02:30:41
<transcript>: Based on a random font file file.

02:30:47
<transcript>: Make a sliding menu. Yeah. You can do that.

02:30:51
beardage: I gotta migrate some projects to next 13 later, did you do it earlier in the stream?

02:30:53
<transcript>: Sock the Dev. We didn't finish the stable. Diffuse and thing. I abandoned it.

02:31:02
<transcript>: So you can't use.

02:31:04
<transcript>: Nex Fonts in other places.

02:31:15
<transcript>: Yeah, I guess like. Well, you know, could you not use this next font library and other libraries? What is specific next in it? I wonder.

02:31:18
<transcript>: Or is there anything.

02:31:22
<transcript>: It know yet adds like the preloading tag.

02:31:22
<transcript>: so

02:31:24
<transcript>: So T you just can't.

02:31:26
<transcript>: You can't.

02:31:33
<transcript>: Get the best of the best. You know, it takes vertical integration.

02:31:33
<transcript>: to get the

02:31:38
<transcript>: To get the best of the best? It's why I love Apple Products if you want the best of the best.

02:31:44
teej_dv: well obviously you can't get the best of the best, you're not even writing rust

02:31:44
<transcript>: They got to own the whole thing. That's my opinion. It's just my opinion. But it is my opinion.

02:31:44
<transcript>: like

02:31:50
shaaah: next is selfish like apple

02:31:51
<transcript>: Like I think using Android phones. And I've done it. I've owned one. I think if you look a little subpar.

02:31:51
<transcript>: and i

02:31:53
<transcript>: And I think it's because.

02:31:55
<transcript>: There's a lot more people involved.

02:31:55
<transcript>: the fewer people

02:31:58
<transcript>: The fewer people that are involved.

02:31:58
<transcript>: the more

02:32:00
<transcript>: The more vertical.

02:32:00
<transcript>: tightly

02:32:02
<transcript>: Tightly integrated all the pieces.

02:32:05
<transcript>: The better it works. So next font.

02:32:05
<transcript>: it

02:32:09
<transcript>: It requires doing some things like preloading your font file.

02:32:13
<transcript>: You can't do that unless you have awareness of.

02:32:13
<transcript>: the rest

02:32:19
<transcript>: The rest of the app, so I think next font does have to live inside of the next app. I could be corrected. I could be wrong.

02:32:19
<transcript>: but

02:32:21
<transcript>: But I think so.

02:32:23
nexxeln: nextjs L

02:32:25
teej_dv: then why use neovim LUL

02:32:26
<transcript>: Capsized. Yeah, I've heard of this bounce. I think. Similar. Probably.

02:32:33
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat, growing NARG.

02:32:34
nexxeln: LUL

02:32:36
<transcript>: nargh

02:32:36
<transcript>: nargh yearning

02:32:38
<transcript>: Nargh yearning for Kearny.

02:32:43
wuelnerdotexe: neryadNotsure

02:32:45
<transcript>: I just come here to make sure DAX isn't slacking on the new SST. Cli.

02:32:45
<transcript>: it's funny

02:32:46
<transcript>: It's funny.

02:32:46
<transcript>: it might

02:32:48
nexxeln: go use xcode LUL

02:32:53
<transcript>: It might read the metadata of it. Oh you think so? We'll try it. I got a migrate some project snakes 13 later.

02:32:53
<transcript>: did you do it

02:33:01
<transcript>: Did you do it earlier in the stream? No. Baritage beardage. We're just doing this with the demo. One of the next demo apps.

02:33:01
<transcript>: thirteen

02:33:10
<transcript>: 13 Next 13 demos. Absolutely. You can't get the best of the best. You're not even running Rust. That's true. Next is selfish. Like Apple. Next. Jsl.

02:33:16
<transcript>: Okay.

02:33:26
<transcript>: So let's try. Do we want to try custom font? Does anyone think that'll work? I do probably have some font files laying around on my machine.

02:33:30
<transcript>: Let's see. Let's bring this over here.

02:33:35
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:33:35
<transcript>: probably

02:33:39
<transcript>: Probably in downloads. That's where most everything is.

02:33:39
<transcript>: down

02:33:41
<transcript>: Download.

02:33:41
<transcript>: font

02:33:42
<transcript>: Font.

02:33:47
<transcript>: Kind of font. Tt norms. Here we go. Found one.

02:33:52
<transcript>: That's not a variable font, though I want to. What is it? Waff.

02:33:52
<transcript>: a waff

02:33:54
<transcript>: A WAFF to font.

02:33:54
<transcript>: no

02:33:58
<transcript>: No. What is the extension? Yeah. Waff.

02:34:00
<transcript>: Waff WAFF.

02:34:02
<transcript>: How many of those.

02:34:02
<transcript>: fraud

02:34:04
<transcript>: Fraudord complete.

02:34:06
<transcript>: Unknown.

02:34:15
<transcript>: Sets. I've got some Bibis Bibus new. That's like my font. That's the fun I use for everything. Let's do that one.

02:34:15
<transcript>: so i'm

02:34:17
<transcript>: So I'm gonna copy that.

02:34:17
<transcript>: i'm gonna put it

02:34:18
<transcript>: I'm gonna put it into.

02:34:21
<transcript>: Where are we.

02:34:23
<transcript>: The playground.

02:34:28
<transcript>: And we're in next 13. We're gonna put it in public.

02:34:34
<transcript>: There it is. There's a font. Let's try this. Bibis waft.

02:34:39
<transcript>: Okay.

02:34:39
<transcript>: let's

02:34:41
<transcript>: Let's do this.

02:34:41
<transcript>: we local

02:34:43
<transcript>: We local fonts. So it's.

02:34:46
<transcript>: Let's just comment all this out.

02:34:49
<transcript>: Like.

02:34:52
<transcript>: And let's do.

02:34:52
<transcript>: import

02:34:54
<transcript>: Import.

02:34:57
<transcript>: What is it of this local font.

02:34:57
<transcript>: from

02:34:59
<transcript>: From.

02:34:59
<transcript>: next

02:35:01
<transcript>: Next Font local.

02:35:03
<transcript>: And then.

02:35:03
<transcript>: const

02:35:06
<transcript>: Const Custom Fonts equals.

02:35:06
<transcript>: local

02:35:08
<transcript>: Local font.

02:35:12
<transcript>: Force.

02:35:16
laytanl_: I don't think that should be in the public dir?

02:35:18
<transcript>: In so it has to be colored to inside of app.

02:35:18
<transcript>: oh okay

02:35:22
impostorengineer: spelling is hard :)

02:35:22
<transcript>: Oh, okay, we'll do that. Vivus. One.

02:35:25
<transcript>: So we got to move that.

02:35:29
<transcript>: What's wrong? Local phone? Oh, it's wait.

02:35:32
<transcript>: Should it be.

02:35:36
impostorengineer: local F ont

02:35:40
impostorengineer: :D

02:35:43
<transcript>: Capital F. Okay, local font, custom font source, and then we're just gonna use that. Okay. We already have the class name in there, so I just need to move it.

02:35:46
<transcript>: This thing.

02:35:46
<transcript>: need to

02:35:47
<transcript>: Need to move.

02:35:47
<transcript>: to

02:35:49
<transcript>: To.

02:35:52
<transcript>: Next 13 app.

02:35:52
<transcript>: viv

02:35:54
<transcript>: Vivus.

02:36:00
<transcript>: Sounds good.

02:36:02
<transcript>: To me.

02:36:05
<transcript>: I doubt.

02:36:05
<transcript>: that

02:36:07
<transcript>: That the.

02:36:20
<transcript>: Size adjust or whatever. I doubt that this stuff works. Now there's gonna be lab shift. That's my guess. Do we want to bet? Do we want to put a like a thing on it pole or a wager.

02:36:20
<transcript>: let's wager

02:36:22
<transcript>: Let's wager. How do we do that.

02:36:22
<transcript>: wager

02:36:24
<transcript>: Wager.

02:36:26
<transcript>: No. What is it.

02:36:26
shaaah: clip it, nextjs will be the most  hated framework after angular soon

02:36:29
<transcript>: It's like a way to bet. Like channel points or something, right.

02:36:34
impostorengineer: predict or something

02:36:34
laytanl_: I think it will work

02:36:39
<transcript>: Spelling is hard.

02:36:39
<transcript>: how do i do

02:36:39
fredkisss: poll ?

02:36:43
<transcript>: How do I do that predict pre.

02:36:43
<transcript>: predict

02:36:45
<transcript>: Prediction.

02:36:48
<transcript>: Here we go. 30 Channel points.

02:36:48
<transcript>: awarded

02:36:53
<transcript>: Awarded to two viewers. Oh, that was a new one. I want to start a new one.

02:36:57
<transcript>: No, that's not what I want to say? I want to say.

02:36:57
<transcript>: will there be

02:36:59
<transcript>: Will there be layout shift.

02:36:59
<transcript>: oh here

02:37:00
teej_dv: i'm going to bet it all

02:37:00
<transcript>: Oh, here we go.

02:37:03
<transcript>: The custom thought.

02:37:03
<transcript>: cause

02:37:06
<transcript>: Cause layout, shift.

02:37:08
ghostyx101: t3ggParty

02:37:09
<transcript>: So yes or no.

02:37:15
<transcript>: 30 seconds. Sounds good. Yeah.

02:37:15
<transcript>: start prediction

02:37:17
<transcript>: Start prediction. Alright. Here we go.

02:37:19
laytanl_: Dutchies can't do betting NotLikeThis

02:37:21
<transcript>: Okay.

02:37:24
<transcript>: Predict. People go for it.

02:37:28
thdxr: I'm back how's it going

02:37:29
<transcript>: Does everyone know how to do it? Just click on the button. Yeah, you know how to do it. What am I talking about.

02:37:34
thdxr: is nextjs 13 the best

02:37:36
<transcript>: Does it show me the results? Oh, oh, look at all the points. Everyone's saying no. It won't create layout shift. Really.

02:37:43
<transcript>: Dax is next. Json. The best.

02:37:44
teej_dv: well actually it's just me betting a lot of points

02:37:44
impostorengineer: idk bet 50 :)

02:37:45
<transcript>: It depends.

02:37:49
<transcript>: I just love saying that. Oh, okay, here we go.

02:37:54
<transcript>: Is the bedding done now? I need to confirm it somehow.

02:37:56
<transcript>: You just bet a lot of points.

02:38:00
fredkisss: bet all of my money

02:38:06
<transcript>: You bet 3000 points. You just don't care about my channel at all. You don't want to use them. Thanks for the follows zeroes and Miguel and Snow Ceram and Pablo Rojo.

02:38:07
ghostyx101: i bet a shift of 50viewport

02:38:11
sockthedev: @thdxr busted!

02:38:12
<transcript>: Okay, here we go. I don't know how to, like, close the thing once we do it, but we're gonna find out. Ready.

02:38:17
teej_dv: i'm just confident that next.js, the best conference makers of all time, will get it right

02:38:18
<transcript>: Is there layout shift. We're looking for a default font first.

02:38:18
<transcript>: oh wait it's

02:38:21
<transcript>: Oh, wait, it's gonna be oh, sorry.

02:38:21
<transcript>: this isn't

02:38:23
<transcript>: This isn't. This doesn't count. Because.

02:38:23
<transcript>: the

02:38:29
<transcript>: The thing. We got to make it bigger. Okay? We're gonna do we're gonna redo the test.

02:38:29
<transcript>: oh is that already

02:38:36
<transcript>: Oh, is that already swapping? I don't even know what the font looks like. I think it already slapped. Let's try it again. New test.

02:38:36
<transcript>: here we go

02:38:37
<transcript>: Here we go.

02:38:47
<transcript>: What if it doesn't swap? Because.

02:38:49
thdxr: why is a refresh so slow

02:38:49
sockthedev: > sockthedev: i just come here to make sure dax isn't slacking on the new SST CLI

02:38:51
<transcript>: Our paid is too fast or something.

02:38:53
<transcript>: Wait. Is it working.

02:38:56
fredkisss: No display swap ?

02:38:58
zirus16: now is cached

02:39:00
impostorengineer: what is the font?

02:39:00
<transcript>: Let's see if this is the right font, even income. We're not sure yet. Everybody hang on.

02:39:02
thdxr: did you disable cache in network inspector

02:39:03
<transcript>: Computed.

02:39:04
shaaah: use 2g fromnetwork tab

02:39:05
teej_dv: i'll call that a W for me

02:39:06
thdxr: can also shift click refresh

02:39:06
ghostyx101: hard refresh

02:39:06
<transcript>: Font Family Bibis new.

02:39:06
<transcript>: is

02:39:17
<transcript>: Is it, though? Is that the babys new font? It's too similar to just like Ariel? Or is there a fallback? Is it swap so many questions? Oh, I didn't do swap. I didn't do.

02:39:19
<transcript>: An adoptional, didn't I.

02:39:19
theloniousbird: It's not Bebas

02:39:22
<transcript>: Bet it optional. Yeah.

02:39:26
<transcript>: Displays.

02:39:27
laytanl_: rigged

02:39:28
<transcript>: Okay.

02:39:28
<transcript>: don't

02:39:31
<transcript>: Don't need to do subsets? Yeah.

02:39:31
<transcript>: okay

02:39:32
<transcript>: Okay.

02:39:32
<transcript>: sorry

02:39:39
<transcript>: Sorry. Hang on. We don't know yet. Don't know the answer unless you look to the docs and you already know the answer.

02:39:41
<transcript>: I don't even know if it's in the docs.

02:39:42
impostorengineer: it shouldn't change anything

02:39:49
<transcript>: Headed W for you now is cash.

02:39:54
<transcript>: Why is a refresh over Throttling DAX.

02:40:01
laytanl_: 2g will take 20 minutes

02:40:04
<transcript>: Tee. I'm just confident that next to you, the best conference makers of all time will get it right. That's right. It's actually versailled. I teach next. Js is the framework.

02:40:04
<transcript>: versaille

02:40:06
<transcript>: Versaille is the company.

02:40:10
<transcript>: Is it done? Okay. Here we go.

02:40:10
<transcript>: i'm going

02:40:14
<transcript>: I'm going to make this bigger, and we're gonna refresh.

02:40:17
<transcript>: Should swap now, right.

02:40:20
teej_dv: well then why wasn't it call vercel conf?

02:40:21
teej_dv: Kappa

02:40:21
<transcript>: Oh, is that layout? Shift.

02:40:23
<transcript>: It doesn't.

02:40:23
<transcript>: font yet

02:40:24
<transcript>: Font yet.

02:40:28
<transcript>: I think I saw layout shit though.

02:40:31
thdxr: I saw shift

02:40:31
shaaah: ^^

02:40:34
<transcript>: I feel like it's not using the new the Real font.

02:40:34
<transcript>: does anyone else

02:40:38
<transcript>: Does anyone else feel like that? I don't think Babeus knew has under.

02:40:38
<transcript>: lowercase

02:40:39
schrew: come on big money

02:40:40
<transcript>: Lowercase, I think they're all uppercase.

02:40:44
<transcript>: I that could be a lie.

02:40:50
<transcript>: We're gonna refresh again. I'm still not sure what just happened. It's not changing the font, right.

02:40:59
<transcript>: What is happening.

02:41:03
<transcript>: What is it doing? I'm hard. Refreshing.

02:41:04
fredkisss: Open the network inspector and disable cache maybe ?

02:41:05
cowfacedude99: hi @teej_dv

02:41:06
<transcript>: Disable Cash. I'll show this.

02:41:12
theloniousbird: Bebas looks like a better version of Impact so this is def not doing what it supposed to for some reason

02:41:15
laytanl_: see if it has any size-adjust properties?

02:41:19
<transcript>: It's just such a basic font, such a mid font like it doesn't. It doesn't tell us that it's a new font because it's so basic.

02:41:25
teej_dv: o/ cowface

02:41:26
<transcript>: Loading. Loading.

02:41:29
<transcript>: Things still on right? Still working.

02:41:32
<transcript>: What is happening here.

02:41:39
<transcript>: I don't think we're even Loading the font yet.

02:41:47
<transcript>: So that is is that babys new.

02:41:52
<transcript>: Location Looks like Ariel.

02:41:55
<transcript>: Let's look at the style sheet.

02:41:57
cowfacedude99: did you have your first poll when I was afk? :(

02:41:59
impostorengineer: that's a serif font, not even arial

02:42:02
<transcript>: And maybe that'll give us a clue. So font, family, source.

02:42:05
<transcript>: Format Fonts Play swap.

02:42:09
<transcript>: Here's the fallback. Oh, wow, it actually.

02:42:09
<transcript>: wait

02:42:13
<transcript>: Wait. It actually no signs. Just 100%.

02:42:15
<transcript>: Does it.

02:42:21
<transcript>: Somehow have a fallback that wait, what.

02:42:23
laytanl_: I think this font is just bad

02:42:27
<transcript>: I just I don't think it's actually random. Does anyone think it's rendering the real font.

02:42:34
<transcript>: Network Inspector Disable Cash. Yeah, we did that. Come on, big money.

02:42:34
<transcript>: i

02:42:37
fredkisss: it is not rendering the real font

02:42:38
<transcript>: I saw shift. I did, but I don't know.

02:42:40
bausmeier: Nope. Real font is all caps like you said.

02:42:42
<transcript>: Actually teach. I think they have a Versaille comp.

02:42:42
<transcript>: i think they have

02:42:45
gzbakku: only non basic font is cocaine font

02:42:46
<transcript>: I think they have next discounts and for so. Comp pretty sure.

02:42:49
bausmeier: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bebas+Neue

02:42:50
<transcript>: Definitely not doing what it's supposed to do for some reason.

02:42:50
<transcript>: see

02:42:52
confusedcoder18: @laytanl_ Nailed it haha

02:42:52
<transcript>: See if there's any size adjust properties.

02:42:53
gzbakku: real egirls only use cocaine font in next js

02:42:55
<transcript>: Yeah, we solve that.

02:42:59
<transcript>: Seraphont, not even Ariel.

02:43:03
<transcript>: Okay. Yes. So that's is that the right font, then.

02:43:06
<transcript>: Real fun is all kinds. It is. Are we sure.

02:43:08
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:43:10
<transcript>: If this.

02:43:10
<transcript>: new font

02:43:12
<transcript>: New font.

02:43:13
fredkisss: Bebas Neue all only caps

02:43:19
teej_dv: just give me my points

02:43:22
shaaah: they use their platform to sheeeet on other frameworks

02:43:25
<transcript>: Oh, is it? Yeah, it sure is. It's all caps. So it's not Loading the font. So hang on. Our test is broken. It's compromised. We gotta figure out why we're not getting the custom font.

02:43:30
<transcript>: Maybe my font file is bunk.

02:43:30
<transcript>: there's nothing wrong

02:43:32
<transcript>: There's nothing wrong with my font file.

02:43:39
<transcript>: So if I look at that style sheet again.

02:43:42
<transcript>: Source next static media.

02:43:48
<transcript>: So that one CEA 84. Let's look at that.

02:43:53
<transcript>: It's this one that does not look like it. That is not it. Right.

02:43:56
<transcript>: Things are the Follow Rock, Warren.

02:43:59
<transcript>: It's not it.

02:44:02
teej_dv: redownload font maybe?

02:44:04
impostorengineer: maybe your file is broken as you said

02:44:08
teej_dv: like, to get a new font file

02:44:12
<transcript>: What are we talking about? Cocaine. Vegas. Just give me my points. Which one did you bet on? Do you don't even know? Use the platform.

02:44:12
<transcript>: to

02:44:17
<transcript>: To redownload font. Maybe. Maybe your file is broken. Yeah, let's just get a new font.

02:44:17
<transcript>: let's get

02:44:18
<transcript>: Let's get a new font file.

02:44:22
<transcript>: Let's download fan family.

02:44:22
teej_dv: LUL it's literally next to my name

02:44:24
<transcript>: Babys new.

02:44:27
<transcript>: There it is. We did it.

02:44:29
gzbakku: cocaine font please

02:44:31
<transcript>: Oh, that's a TTF file. Will that work.

02:44:37
wuelnerdotexe: @teej_dv It's not the right place, but what do you think of noice, it's so nice it's tempting to ask for it natively... RaccAttack

02:44:38
<transcript>: Will it work? Do I need it to be a WAFF file? Let's try it.

02:44:44
<transcript>: There. And then we're gonna put it in.

02:44:47
<transcript>: Playground.

02:44:49
shaaah: u need to convert it to woff

02:44:49
<transcript>: Where am I.

02:44:51
teej_dv: noice seems very cool, it's far from being stable. It will not be upstreamed

02:44:52
<transcript>: Playground.

02:44:52
laytanl_: I think woff has the metadata, thats why they recommend it

02:44:54
<transcript>: Next 13.

02:44:58
<transcript>: It's right inside the App directory.

02:44:59
<transcript>: Okay.

02:45:03
<transcript>: Vibes TTF Just try that.

02:45:06
<transcript>: And then I'm gonna go in.

02:45:06
<transcript>: here and i'm

02:45:08
<transcript>: Here? And I'm gonna say.

02:45:10
teej_dv: Some individual aspects may be upstreamed or certain features made in core to make noice work better

02:45:11
<transcript>: That is TPS.

02:45:11
<transcript>: okay

02:45:13
<transcript>: Okay.

02:45:13
<transcript>: let's

02:45:15
<transcript>: Let's try it again.

02:45:22
<transcript>: Is there any any moderator here who actually knows.

02:45:22
<transcript>: how

02:45:25
<transcript>: How to do the prediction thing.

02:45:29
<transcript>: How to like close out the prediction thing.

02:45:34
teej_dv: click on your prediction thing again

02:45:38
teej_dv: and you can choose

02:45:40
<transcript>: Oh, it says next to your name that you predicted no or yes. Okay. So, T you said no.

02:45:40
<transcript>: there will not

02:45:42
<transcript>: There will not be layoff shift.

02:45:47
<transcript>: Click on your prediction thing again, and you can choose.

02:45:47
schrew: No refunds NotLikeThis

02:45:50
<transcript>: Can I.

02:45:50
<transcript>: what predict

02:45:54
<transcript>: What prediction thing? It just went away. I don't have it anymore.

02:45:58
impostorengineer: chose winner something

02:45:59
<transcript>: I could type prediction again.

02:46:03
<transcript>: Maybe like this.

02:46:03
<transcript>: oh yeah

02:46:08
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. Manage prediction. Okay, I can do it. 87%. You said no. Layout shift.

02:46:12
<transcript>: Okay. We're still we're still finding out. Hang on.

02:46:13
laytanl_: Use a woff font or this is rigged

02:46:15
<transcript>: Let's try this.

02:46:15
impostorengineer: did I win LUL

02:46:21
<transcript>: Make sure those aren't okay. Refresh. Here we go.

02:46:25
<transcript>: I.

02:46:28
<transcript>: Was that no Lam shift.

02:46:34
<transcript>: We'll do it again. I think it's no layout shift. Somehow. I don't understand how they do that.

02:46:34
<transcript>: with custom font

02:46:35
<transcript>: With Custom fonts.

02:46:46
vim_cerf: PogChamp

02:46:46
laytanl_: Eyy we won!

02:46:47
<transcript>: That's no layout shift, right? I'm just seeing the fond is taller, so it looks almost like the brain almost feels like it layout shifts a little bit, but I don't think it is.

02:46:50
fredkisss: OH NO !!

02:46:55
<transcript>: Yeah, no, no. Lampshift. Look at that.

02:46:55
<transcript>: look at it

02:46:56
<transcript>: Look at it.

02:46:59
wuelnerdotexe: @teej_dv I can't wait to see how far it can go \0/

02:47:00
teej_dv: eziest points of my life

02:47:01
teej_dv: doubters OUT

02:47:03
schrew: It do be shifting monkaS

02:47:05
<transcript>: Use a wafont, or this is rigged. Oh, really? Is that what it was? Does the waffon somehow change this.

02:47:05
<transcript>: easy sp

02:47:07
<transcript>: Easy sports.

02:47:13
<transcript>: All right, I think it's no layout. Tiff. Do you really think.

02:47:13
<transcript>: leightens

02:47:14
teej_dv: DOUBTERS OUT

02:47:14
thdxr: use comic sans or this is rigged

02:47:17
laytanl_: No I thought it would only work on woffs

02:47:18
shaaah: ttf is irrelevant

02:47:18
<transcript>: Leightens, you really suspect that if I use a waffont, it would change.

02:47:21
<transcript>: The outcome.

02:47:23
<transcript>: Complete.

02:47:26
teej_dv: IM RICH

02:47:26
vim_cerf: I'm sad to loose my points, but happy the layout isn't popping and jumping during load.

02:47:29
<transcript>: Ttf is irrelevant. That's. That's what? That's what I say. I thought it would only work on WAFF.

02:47:31
fredkisss: I HAD ONLY SOME POINTS AND ALL IS LOST NotLikeThis

02:47:33
<transcript>: Cool Use Comic Sands.

02:47:39
<transcript>: Oh, no, Fred. Kiss. You lost your only points.

02:47:39
<transcript>: all

02:47:41
<transcript>: All is lost.

02:47:41
<transcript>: i'm so sorry

02:47:42
<transcript>: I'm so sorry.

02:47:42
<transcript>: but

02:47:46
thdxr: we need points stimulus package

02:47:47
<transcript>: But yeah, there's no layer shift. Somehow. Magically.

02:47:47
<transcript>: i don't

02:47:49
<transcript>: I don't know how they do that.

02:47:52
<transcript>: Which single stack is.

02:47:52
<transcript>: thanks for the

02:47:53
thdxr: central bank of adam

02:47:55
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow confused coder.

02:48:01
teej_dv: these points? oh they're focused

02:48:01
<transcript>: You start printing more points.

02:48:04
fredkisss: maybe they calculate the font size somehow

02:48:06
<transcript>: Okay, so next font is cool.

02:48:06
<transcript>: big fan

02:48:07
<transcript>: Big fan.

02:48:10
cowfacedude99: you can rick roll adam a bunch @teej_dv LUL

02:48:12
<transcript>: As cool as I thought it'd be I think I think it's as cool.

02:48:15
laytanl_: I am so sad we can't bet with points in my country

02:48:17
<transcript>: I mean, I wouldn't suggest using Bibis New as your site font, but.

02:48:18
teej_dv: two word: eziest win ever

02:48:23
<transcript>: No layout shift, even for custom fonts. I would like to know how that works. I'm going to look at the code at some point.

02:48:23
<transcript>: and

02:48:27
<transcript>: And not understand it. But I'm gonna look.

02:48:33
<transcript>: Okay, what else do we want to play with with next 13, so we confirmed you can't opt out of react.

02:48:33
<transcript>: dax

02:48:35
<transcript>: Dax. I don't know if you're here for that, but.

02:48:35
<transcript>: no matter

02:48:39
<transcript>: No matter whether your app has only server components.

02:48:43
<transcript>: Or you use Plan Components if you're not using any client components.

02:48:43
<transcript>: you're still shipping

02:48:47
<transcript>: You're still shipping. React in the current thirteen. Zero one.

02:48:47
<transcript>: you can't even

02:48:50
<transcript>: You can't even use the old.

02:48:50
<transcript>: unst

02:48:56
thdxr: ouch

02:48:56
<transcript>: Unstable runtime JS flag where you could turn off sending the client runtime. You can't do that.

02:48:56
<transcript>: you are stuck

02:49:01
<transcript>: You are stuck with if you use the app directory you are shipping react to your client.

02:49:01
<transcript>: to your client

02:49:03
<transcript>: To your client, your users.

02:49:06
<transcript>: No way to stop it from what I can tell.

02:49:26
<transcript>: Which I mean, that's a choice. That's a thing that they did. Thank you for the follow Samuel Hong and I don't know. Maybe this is an edge case. Maybe no one else cares. Maybe it's because I'm comparing it to Astro, or I'm comparing it to these other, like, HTML first frameworks, but I thought React server components were like, hey, look, if you don't need client interactivity.

02:49:26
<transcript>: render

02:49:37
<transcript>: Render server components. You're just creating HTML, but you're using React on the back end and you can do all the data fetching and one unified model that seemed compelling to me. The fact that that's not how it works is a bummer.

02:49:37
<transcript>: for me

02:49:45
<transcript>: For me again. I don't know how much they care, but I know that some people care and have voiced it on Twitter. They care about the bundle sizes.

02:49:48
<transcript>: So we'll see.

02:49:48
<transcript>: we'll

02:49:52
<transcript>: We'll see if that changes. I would think that they could do some optimizations to say.

02:49:52
<transcript>: hey look

02:49:58
<transcript>: Hey, look, you're not using any client components, so let's not ship the runtime at all.

02:49:58
<transcript>: let's just

02:49:59
<transcript>: Let's just.

02:49:59
<transcript>: ship

02:50:03
<transcript>: Ship a bunch of HTML and CSS.

02:50:10
cowfacedude99: I think it would change sooner than later

02:50:16
<transcript>: But there's been people pointed out like navigation if you do any navigation at all, if you use next link, you're gonna need React. But isn't that kind of like also making my point? Like Why do we need react.

02:50:16
<transcript>: for

02:50:19
<transcript>: For Preloading links.

02:50:23
<transcript>: I guess if those things you're preloading.

02:50:27
<transcript>: Use client components, I guess. Like.

02:50:27
<transcript>: i

02:50:32
fredkisss: link is a component

02:50:36
<transcript>: I guess maybe it's just safe to assume this is how it's always gonna be. If you use an XJS, expect you're using React. It was always a hack that I was doing in the next twelve and before.

02:50:36
<transcript>: to not

02:50:38
<transcript>: To not include react.

02:50:38
<transcript>: if you

02:50:42
fredkisss: a React component

02:50:46
<transcript>: If you're using next s, I guess you're saying you're happy to use React in your apps. It just seems. I don't know. It just seems bad to me that like an easy.

02:50:53
impostorengineer: seems overkill

02:50:58
fredkisss: you can add even an onClick to Link, so react is needed

02:51:02
<transcript>: If that's their main use case for next apps. Mike should ecommerce if everyone if let's say they just owned the market share and like next year just took off and every Ecommerce store let's say Shopify was like Never Mind remix we're using Next day s.

02:51:02
<transcript>: every

02:51:08
<transcript>: Every ecommerce store you hit to buy things is using us. That means react.

02:51:08
<transcript>: is

02:51:15
laytanl_: e-commerce loads all those analytics scripts anyway

02:51:16
<transcript>: Is powering ecommerce, and it just feels that why is that feel wrong to me? Does that feel wrong to anyone else? Just feels like heavy for what.

02:51:16
<transcript>: is like

02:51:20
<transcript>: Is like adding things to a cart and checking out.

02:51:24
thdxr: the solution is to ship react with the browser

02:51:28
<transcript>: I think it would change sooner than later. Yeah. They're gonna change it. I imagine to be soon. Link is a component of react component. Yep.

02:51:28
<transcript>: that seems

02:51:37
<transcript>: That seems overkill you can add even an onclick to link, so react is needed. Yeah, now that makes sense if you're using yeah, I get it.

02:51:39
<transcript>: If you're using any of the stuff.

02:51:39
<transcript>: any of the stuff

02:51:41
teej_dv: if it's in the cloud it's fast

02:51:42
teej_dv: don't worry

02:51:42
<transcript>: Any of the stuff that next year does.

02:51:42
<transcript>: it's all

02:51:48
<transcript>: It's all dependent on react. I think for the sub been in a banana banana.

02:51:53
<transcript>: The solution is to ship react with the browser. There you go. If we're gonna do.

02:51:53
<transcript>: default

02:51:57
<transcript>: Default every app to having react in it. Let's just put it in the browser. That's a good idea.

02:52:07
<transcript>: Ecommerce loads all those Analytics scripts anyway. Yeah, that's true. I even said that earlier, like I came to the same conclusion that.

02:52:07
<transcript>: i'm

02:52:18
shaaah: Replace react with svelte, all problems solved

02:52:19
<transcript>: I'm trying to optimize for ecommerce when like merchants are the worst about just adding every possible thing to their site. Like you're being tracked by like 14 different ad trackers.

02:52:24
<transcript>: Every ecommerce experience I've had is like, Why did they add so many things.

02:52:24
<transcript>: to

02:52:26
<transcript>: To this site.

02:52:32
<transcript>: If it's in the cloud, it's fast. Don't worry.

02:52:36
<transcript>: Replace react with felt allproblem solve.

02:52:41
cowfacedude99: I really like astro for this kind of stuff. especially combined with intersection observer. If you don't see the button, you don't get the js. https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientvisible

02:52:47
<transcript>: I don't know. I'm really curious. Five years from now, if the world looks more like a lot of react or more like there was a turning point. And we moved slowly away from React for new stuff.

02:52:50
<transcript>: Wish you could just fast forward and see.

02:52:50
<transcript>: see the answer

02:52:51
<transcript>: See the answer to that question.

02:52:58
<transcript>: But I have some pretty big decisions to make in terms of tech stacks. And this all is like bouncing around in my head a lot.

02:53:00
thdxr: I'm planningon using astro for an ecommerce site, it's going to be so light

02:53:03
<transcript>: So, Kathy, you really like.

02:53:03
<transcript>: astro

02:53:04
<transcript>: Astro.

02:53:12
<transcript>: And especially combined with intersection observer. If you don't see the button, you don't get the JS. Yeah. So that's the thing.

02:53:12
<transcript>: if you're building

02:53:14
<transcript>: If you're building a brochure site.

02:53:14
<transcript>: and i

02:53:17
<transcript>: And I think if you're building an ecommerce site.

02:53:17
<transcript>: the amount of

02:53:21
<transcript>: The amount of JavaScript it takes to preload links and preload images.

02:53:21
<transcript>: is like

02:53:41
<transcript>: Is like two K. We're talking like 2 JavaScript so you can use intersection observers and to do the preloading or just use native browser stuff for the lazing Loading on images. That's what I think next image does now. Like the browser just keeps getting better. They keep adding more things into the browsers and I get it like browser support is tough. Like across all browsers, whatever.

02:53:41
<transcript>: but like next

02:53:52
<transcript>: But like Next link got better. Our next image got better by removing a bunch of the JavaScript and using browser native APIs. Over time it's gonna feel really silly to ship.

02:53:52
<transcript>: two hundred

02:53:57
<transcript>: 200 KB uncompressed JavaScript to preload links.

02:54:01
<transcript>: That's gonna feel really bad when.

02:54:05
<transcript>: It just feels very unnecessary. I don't know.

02:54:11
<transcript>: I don't know. I'm planning on using Astro for an ecommerce site. It's going to be so light, so light.

02:54:20
<transcript>: Does anyone care about this stuff? Is it just like a few people that need to get over it. And then the rest of the world is moving on.

02:54:28
<transcript>: Let's look at the next 13.

02:54:30
shaaah: astro for ecommerce works ?

02:54:31
<transcript>: Let's just go to nextjs.org. Let's look at like.

02:54:31
<transcript>: yeah next

02:54:37
<transcript>: Yeah next 13. Show me all the features, powerful routing Lans. I just want to make sure there's not some room we want to play with.

02:54:41
<transcript>: I guess we could see what next image looks like.

02:54:48
<transcript>: If it's feels any different. Oh, we can make a link tag and not have an anchor tag in it, but I'm sure that's already happening all over the place.

02:54:48
<transcript>: yeah

02:54:50
<transcript>: Yeah. Like.

02:54:50
<transcript>: check out

02:54:52
<transcript>: Check out these Linked Tags.

02:54:52
<transcript>: no anchor

02:54:54
<transcript>: No anchor tag in them.

02:54:54
<transcript>: not a single one

02:54:56
<transcript>: Not a single one.

02:55:01
<transcript>: Does anyone remember? Of course you remember if you've ever written the next app.

02:55:01
<transcript>: choose to look like

02:55:03
<transcript>: Choose to look like.

02:55:05
<transcript>: Anchor.

02:55:06
thdxr: I hope so!

02:55:13
<transcript>: And anchor. And now does it have, like a limping error? No. So let's let you do it.

02:55:19
<transcript>: You step to those naked anchor Tags in there. It looked super weird.

02:55:24
<transcript>: Building on React Server Components App now makes Server First the default.

02:55:24
<transcript>: powered by verse

02:55:26
fredkisss: What could be cool is that react reduces their bundle size, that would be the graal

02:55:30
<transcript>: Powered by verse L functions. So here's. Okay. I'm coming over here? I'm coming over here? I got something to say.

02:55:35
laytanl_: It would be with a headless e-commerce provider, right @thdxr ?

02:55:35
<transcript>: And then I'll be coherent, more valuable. But I have something to say.

02:55:41
<transcript>: And that thing is first of all, thank you for the follow. Shacker. Amine.

02:55:43
laytanl_: got one in mind?

02:55:44
<transcript>: Here's what I have to say.

02:55:49
<transcript>: The server components by default.

02:55:49
<transcript>: what

02:55:53
<transcript>: What is the appeal of server components? If.

02:56:02
<transcript>: You're going to ship the full React runtime and the full next JS thing 200 uncompressed JavaScript.

02:56:02
<transcript>: every time

02:56:06
benanna19: I think a big 'issue/problem' with the javascript react stuff is what people are learning now in bootcamps.   As a bootcamp grad, this problem/issue is not something I heard about until 2 years after I graduated bootcamp.

02:56:09
cowfacedude99: @Fredkisss isn't that preact's game?

02:56:10
<transcript>: Every time, regardless of server composer components, client components, whatever. What is the appeal? I know people say I've seen this in Tweets from Dan and others.

02:56:11
laytanl_: SEO

02:56:21
<transcript>: The the server component isn't bundled in and not since it's a client. Okay. But like what percentage of your app is server components versus client components.

02:56:21
<transcript>: and

02:56:25
thdxr: the appeal is you can show off better lighthouse scores

02:56:27
laytanl_: no hydration

02:56:28
<transcript>: And with those server components ever make a dent, would they ever contribute even a little bit to that 200 JavaScript.

02:56:32
<transcript>: Can you show off? Better Linehouse scores. Tax, I guess.

02:56:32
<transcript>: lighthouse

02:56:35
<transcript>: Lighthouse just doesn't care if you ship 200 JavaScript.

02:56:42
<transcript>: Like I guess if you're not doing things that block, like if you're not doing the bad thing with JavaScript.

02:56:42
<transcript>: that's fine

02:56:45
thdxr: I mean compared to an SPA

02:56:46
thdxr: yeah

02:56:47
<transcript>: That's fine. So it's all this fine. It's just fine. I just need to calm down.

02:56:51
<transcript>: Compared to a spa.

02:56:54
thdxr: NO IT'S NOT FINE

02:56:57
<transcript>: Know hydration.

02:56:57
laytanl_: its 200kb and does not increase much

02:56:58
fredkisss: The server component is not for reducing react-dom size, but third party libs like markdown libs for ex that would not need to be shipped to the clienbt

02:57:00
<transcript>: No, it's not. Fine.

02:57:03
thdxr: vercel needs to pay for their crimes

02:57:11
<transcript>: Yeah. What are we getting? That's the question. What are we getting for that 200 KB? Because you haven't even added like spa like libraries that you might need. So let's say you're building.

02:57:22
<transcript>: So I built public Dev and the editor is very much a pretty bloated spa. There's some drag and drop stuff. So you have to have some kind of a drag and drop library.

02:57:27
<transcript>: There's image editing like you can choose and crop images.

02:57:34
<transcript>: Drop zones. All that stuff that's like spa, like functionality. You're starting to add these libraries to.

02:57:38
<transcript>: Make this rich client functionality work.

02:57:38
<transcript>: that stuff

02:57:43
<transcript>: That stuff is heavy. So if we're starting at a baseline of 200 JavaScript.

02:57:43
<transcript>: for what is

02:57:46
<transcript>: For what is basically navigation.

02:57:46
<transcript>: look we

02:57:57
<transcript>: Look we didn't render the navigation and you're able to load that page without rerendering. Is that worth 200 JavaScript the economic just don't make sense to me if we were like.

02:57:57
<transcript>: talking

02:58:04
<transcript>: Talking JavaScript economics or just like resource economics like the usage of resources.

02:58:14
<transcript>: I don't feel like the 200 KB is justified. Like the next font not having the layout shift. Super cool. I'm excited about it.

02:58:18
<transcript>: Is it worth 200 JavaScript? I don't know.

02:58:20
<transcript>: That's the question.

02:58:20
<transcript>: like if i'm

02:58:23
<transcript>: Like if I'm opting into next, I'm opting into.

02:58:23
<transcript>: that

02:58:25
<transcript>: That.

02:58:31
shaaah: whats a good kb js ?

02:58:40
<transcript>: The server components is not for reducing react Dom size, but thirdparty lives like Markdown Libs, for example, that would not need to be shipped to the client. So Markdown Libs that's a good example. So I.

02:58:40
<transcript>: let me put my head

02:58:43
<transcript>: Let me put my head around this because I use a markdown.

02:58:43
<transcript>: library

02:58:46
<transcript>: Library in Public Dev.

02:58:46
<transcript>: and it

02:58:50
<transcript>: And it renders markdown into.

02:58:50
<transcript>: html

02:58:52
<transcript>: Html, elements.

02:58:52
<transcript>: so you

02:58:54
<transcript>: So you pass it a big string of Mark down from the database.

02:58:54
<transcript>: renders

02:59:00
<transcript>: Renders it okay. So that. Yeah. So the markdown component is really heavy.

02:59:04
<transcript>: And to the extent that you don't have to ship.

02:59:04
<transcript>: the mark

02:59:13
<transcript>: The markdown piece. It just runs on the server side and spits out HTML. Then you're reducing your JavaScript bundle. I guess my question is like.

02:59:15
terawatthour: you could do that on the server side before no?

02:59:25
<transcript>: Is that the norm is the norm that we're gonna have a whole lot of stuff. We can shift onto the server side and save a lot of JavaScript in the client bundle. Is that the normal or is the norm.

02:59:25
<transcript>: that

02:59:34
<transcript>: That server side components will just be basic navigation and layouts, and they would have hardly contributed to the bundle anyway. Does that make sense.

02:59:37
fredkisss: The former

02:59:41
fredkisss: and the later

02:59:41
<transcript>: Terror 1 hour you could do it on the surface side before.

02:59:41
<transcript>: so

02:59:42
<transcript>: So.

02:59:46
<transcript>: Former and the ladder.

02:59:54
<transcript>: Wait. I got I confused myself. What did I ask, Fred? Because I got I started reading Terror Watts hour.

02:59:57
<transcript>: I mean Terror, Watt, hours, question.

02:59:57
<transcript>: like

03:00:00
nullchefo: it will be better if it is actually modular like there will be a base package with the smallest amount of js that is possible  and then you can opt-in and add the things that you need

03:00:00
laytanl_: This app https://taxonomyapp.vercel.app/ is a "full" example app which loads  ~200kb and has a lot of functionality

03:00:08
<transcript>: Like I'm doing it on the server side with public Dev. I'm rendering the markdown component on the server and then I'm not shipping react by using that unstable thing.

03:00:10
thdxr: I still think this is all about making a unified API for data fetching across client and server and the performance stuff is secondary

03:00:12
laytanl_: so the bundle doesnt increase much from the initial 200kb

03:00:13
<transcript>: So. Yeah. I guess I'm not getting anything from surface components. In that case.

03:00:13
<transcript>: am i

03:00:15
<transcript>: Am I.

03:00:24
shaaah: unpopular opinion: Why make the server do all the heavy lifting when computer and mobiles phones are fast enough to handle js

03:00:24
<transcript>: It will be better if it is actually modular like there will be a base package with the smallest amount of JS as possible, and you can opt in and add things that you need.

03:00:24
<transcript>: oh right because

03:00:27
fredkisss: the twos, reduce JS bundle for 3rd party and faciliate fetching in nextjs

03:00:30
<transcript>: Oh, right. Because every route can like it's layering in new stuff.

03:00:30
<transcript>: that's needed

03:00:31
<transcript>: That's needed.

03:00:38
<transcript>: But is that different? Is that different in the next 13? Like if you have children pages in next twelve.

03:00:38
<transcript>: that use

03:00:40
<transcript>: That use JavaScript. It's not used.

03:00:43
<transcript>: Higher up, like.

03:00:48
<transcript>: If you have a paid well just I guess it's at the page level. Everything's at the page level.

03:00:48
<transcript>: so

03:00:49
<transcript>: So.

03:00:49
<transcript>: every

03:00:54
<transcript>: Every page has its own bundle and if you only use.

03:00:54
<transcript>: rich

03:01:03
<transcript>: Rich client libraries that are really heavy in one page. They won't necessarily show up in the bundle for another page. But now we've got it at the component level, I guess.

03:01:08
shaaah: Next could use Preact, to decrease the bundle size

03:01:11
<transcript>: This app takes on me. App is a full example app which let's 200 KB that has a lot of functionality.

03:01:11
<transcript>: i want to look

03:01:15
<transcript>: I want to look at that. I'm gonna pull it up, and I'll go back to my screen. Here.

03:01:26
<transcript>: Zach, I still think this is all about making a unified API for data fetching across client server and the performance of a secondary yeah, no, I agree. And clearly the performances of primary.

03:01:30
terawatthour: with next 13 vercel is getting ready to do something big but probably they themself dont know what is it going to be

03:01:30
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat and not wanted to chat. Thank you for the follow. Amy.

03:01:30
<transcript>: and bought

03:01:34
<transcript>: And bought Nicks and checker Amine. Oh, I think I already said that one.

03:01:46
<transcript>: So the bundle doesn't increase much from the initial 200K unpopular opinion. Why make the server do all the heavy lifting when computer and mobile phones are fast enough to handle JS Great question.

03:01:46
<transcript>: the twos

03:01:49
<transcript>: The twos reduce JavaScript bundle for third party.

03:01:49
<transcript>: and

03:01:52
<transcript>: And facilitate fetching in next JS.

03:01:59
<transcript>: Could use PreAct to decrease the bundle size.

03:02:06
<transcript>: With next 13 for cell is getting ready to do something big but probably they themselves don't know what it is going to be.

03:02:08
<transcript>: Seems like a bad strategy.

03:02:12
<transcript>: Like we've done a lot of stuff.

03:02:12
<transcript>: as an industry

03:02:22
trout_soda: that's like "should I tow this trailer with a Ferrari or my pickup?"

03:02:22
<transcript>: As an industry to know where it's headed, I think somebody knows where it's headed. Surely. Right. All right, I'm gonna take quick break, got a pee. Still my water. And I'll be back.

03:02:34
cowfacedude99: @shaaah Not everyone uses fast computers and phones.

03:02:45
impostorengineer: I really like your setup. it looks so cool

03:02:52
cowfacedude99: especially where I live.

03:03:16
shaaah: @shaaah those people who doesnt use it, doesnt deserve fast website :p

03:03:47
fredkisss: @laytanl_ I think they talked about it, that it scales well for big apps without adding more that the 200kb.

03:03:49
shaaah: @shaaah also why do you have a vercel logo, are you snitiching on us?

03:04:24
fredkisss: @laytanl_ I think we have to test it in bigger productions apps to really see the benefit and also wait a little longer when the API is stable

03:04:52
laytanl_: @Fredkisss yeah I think they focus more on the bigger apps, and for static things you would use something else

03:04:59
cowfacedude99: @shaaah 1. you might be cutting off a pretty sizable userbase. 2. it's cheer bit LUL

03:05:05
laytanl_: @Fredkisss at least at the moment

03:05:57
fredkisss: @shaaah @shaaah in my country we do not have enough buying power, so why would you want us to not have fast websites ?

03:06:27
fredkisss: @laytanl_ For static : ASTRO >>>

03:06:45
fredkisss: For dashboard : Next for me

03:10:32
bheet: how do you keep a desk that clean?

03:10:54
<transcript>: Those people don't use it doesn't serve fast website.

03:10:54
<transcript>: i think

03:11:06
yuji_rexion: hey hey people

03:11:14
<transcript>: I think there's other skills well for big apps that adding more than the 200 KB. Also, why do you have a Versail logo? Are you sticking? I think we have to test it in bigger productions apps to really see the benefits and also wait a little longer when the API is table. Yeah, all this stuff is early. I think they focus more on the bigger apps and for stack things. You would do something else.

03:11:33
<transcript>: For static Astro for Dashboard. Next, that's a good rule of thumb. How do you keep a desk that clean.

03:11:33
<transcript>: here

03:11:35
<transcript>: Here's my trick.

03:11:35
<transcript>: i

03:11:38
<transcript>: I just point a camera at it a lot.

03:11:41
<transcript>: Ends up being pretty clean.

03:11:46
<transcript>: When you know it's gonna be on camera that day.

03:11:46
<transcript>: you didn't

03:11:54
<transcript>: You didn't not leave stuff on it. It's even I've got some stuff on it. There's. Like Lara Bar Laughers wrappers.

03:11:54
<transcript>: okay

03:11:55
<transcript>: Okay.

03:11:55
<transcript>: let's

03:11:56
<transcript>: Let's.

03:11:59
<transcript>: Hey, hey? Euge.

03:12:06
<transcript>: Let's do something. What is this? This is the one that was like a rich app. Get started.

03:12:06
<transcript>: i have to sign

03:12:07
nexxeln: for me: for static: astro, for app: remix

03:12:09
<transcript>: I have to sign in. Is this actually do something.

03:12:09
<transcript>: do i

03:12:12
<transcript>: Do I want to sign up for this publishing platform for every one.

03:12:15
<transcript>: Let's try it.

03:12:15
<transcript>: why not

03:12:16
<transcript>: Why not.

03:12:21
<transcript>: Go why not? Because the button doesn't work.

03:12:23
fredkisss: Signin not working yet

03:12:24
<transcript>: How about this one? No. Okay.

03:12:26
<transcript>: Well.

03:12:29
<transcript>: I could give it my email.

03:12:29
<transcript>: i don't really care

03:12:30
<transcript>: I don't really care.

03:12:34
<transcript>: Oh.

03:12:34
<transcript>: deploy

03:12:34
fredkisss: go to blog at least

03:12:38
<transcript>: Deployment is okay, so this one's not working at the moment.

03:12:42
<transcript>: You know what I want to do? I want to.

03:12:42
<transcript>: oh

03:12:42
yuji_rexion: do you have any online courses available?

03:12:43
<transcript>: Oh go to blog and.

03:12:43
<transcript>: let's do

03:12:45
<transcript>: Let's do that.

03:12:47
yuji_rexion: if so where can I find them

03:12:49
<transcript>: Blog a blog built using MDX content.

03:12:49
<transcript>: personal site

03:12:51
<transcript>: Personal site.

03:12:53
<transcript>: Oh, it's shed? Yeah, Yeah.

03:12:53
<transcript>: single

03:12:56
<transcript>: Single page, page, nation.

03:12:56
<transcript>: oh yeah

03:12:59
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. I mean, it feels fast.

03:13:02
<transcript>: Using postmark.

03:13:05
<transcript>: See you.

03:13:05
<transcript>: fast to me

03:13:06
<transcript>: Fast to me.

03:13:17

<transcript>: for

03:13:24
<transcript>: For Static Astro for App Remix says next.

03:13:27
<transcript>: Have you always been a.

03:13:38
<transcript>: Remix person or have you been like, Were you on Next more when it was Next before 13? Like did you use Next a lot? And now you're just assigning you're gonna switch or where you at next.

03:13:40
laytanl_: here is source for that site btw https://github.com/shadcn/taxonomy

03:13:43
<transcript>: Have any online courses available? Is still working I find them.

03:13:43
<transcript>: i'm working

03:13:48
nexxeln: yeah. but i used next a lot cause t3

03:13:51
<transcript>: I'm working on working on some educational stuff. Sorry. Youtube channel. So there'll be some stuff there.

03:13:54
<transcript>: But nothing right now.

03:13:54
<transcript>: nothing like

03:13:55
fredkisss: Will not using remix, their marketing is terrible

03:13:56
<transcript>: Nothing like you can go out and buy.

03:13:58
shadyendless: @nexxeln This is exactly the same path my company is going down, haha.

03:14:03
<transcript>: Just. Yeah. Check out my YouTube. It's in my about me or whatever on Twitch.

03:14:17
<transcript>: Somebody today tweeted like somebody asked, who your favorite developer, YouTubers. And somebody replied with, like, this big list. And it's like, all these who's who of you of YouTubers on Dev. And then they put me on there.

03:14:17
<transcript>: i've got

03:14:21
<transcript>: I've got two. I got two videos on YouTube, and they're kind of dumb.

03:14:21
<transcript>: i just thought

03:14:30
nexxeln: @Fredkisss are we judging frameworks on marketing now

03:14:31
<transcript>: I just thought that was funny. Like I appreciate it a whole lot, but like, I don't know, maybe wait, make sure I don't just abandon it after two videos.

03:14:39
<transcript>: Not using remix. Their marketing is terrible. Yeah. What is that? Marketing strategy? Like, Yell at everybody.

03:14:39
<transcript>: and see

03:14:40
<transcript>: And see how it goes.

03:14:50
annngelo: thoughts on svelte?

03:14:54
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Shady Endless. This is exactly the same path my company's going down. Astro for static remix for apps. Are we judging Frameworks on Marketing now.

03:15:06
<transcript>: From Sfeeltvelt. I don't use felt. I like the things I've seen of it, you know, like the little memes.

03:15:06
<transcript>: like

03:15:08
laytanl_: yeah remix doesn't have very friendly people behind it

03:15:09
<transcript>: Like Svelt versus.

03:15:09
thdxr: svelte is for weirdos!

03:15:10
fredkisss: @Fredkisss Their initial marketing with ryan florence heating twitter drama, and people talking about remix like it could cure cancer

03:15:13
<transcript>: Versus react meme like I like this one.

03:15:13
<transcript>: this one

03:15:15
<transcript>: This one. This one's good.

03:15:19
ad0ran: thoughts on jQuery ?

03:15:21
<transcript>: I like that. But like I don't know much about beyond that.

03:15:21
<transcript>: i know

03:15:22
<transcript>: I know. It's very minimal.

03:15:22
<transcript>: which is cool

03:15:25
<transcript>: Which is cool thoughts on jquery.

03:15:29
<transcript>: Boldly bit of goody proven proven track record.

03:15:34
ad0ran: jQuery #1, agreed

03:15:38
grasp5533: enhance.dev ?

03:15:44
<transcript>: Remix doesn't have a very friendly people behind it. I think I think it's just personality. They're probably very friendly. Like if you met him, I'll give you hung out with Michael and Ryan in person.

03:15:51
kedemel: Would be hilarious if we all circled back to jQuery

03:16:02
<transcript>: You probably like in Chance seems great, even on Twitter. I think I think Ryan just has a certain personality that probably comes off like, I probably come off terrible on Twitter. I think I do. I think I like being on Twitch, partly because when I write things, I think I just sound like a jerk.

03:16:02
<transcript>: personally

03:16:03
<transcript>: Personally.

03:16:09
wuelnerdotexe: Vanilla >>

03:16:15
<transcript>: Maybe I don't. Maybe I just read into it. But when I write stuff on the Internet, I generally think it sounds smug, like I'm a jerk. So I like to get on video where I can show you I'm not entirely a jerk.

03:16:17
thdxr: I met you on twitter so I guess I like smug jerks

03:16:20
<transcript>: Is this my personality doesn't come off well in text. I think it's hardly that.

03:16:20
<transcript>: and then part of

03:16:21
<transcript>: And then part of.

03:16:23
<transcript>: There's a lot of competition.

03:16:23
<transcript>: in this space

03:16:26
<transcript>: In this space for mind shape.

03:16:26
<transcript>: being

03:16:28
<transcript>: Being the kind of dominant player.

03:16:32
nexxeln: vercel marketing isn't that great either, ecan you said this about turbopack marketing

03:16:34
<transcript>: That leads to some probably pressures that bring out the worst in US the time.

03:16:34
nexxeln: There were number rounding issues in the original numbers for the 1k component case - Turbopack's 15ms was rounded down to 0.01s while Vite's 87ms was rounded up to 0.09s. This further got marketed as a 10x advantage when the original numbers were close to 6x.

03:16:41
<transcript>: Their initial marketing with Ron Florence is heating Twitter drama and people talking about remakes like it could cure cancer.

03:16:41
<transcript>: yeah i mean

03:16:44
teej_dv: LUL ppl complaining that JS ppl overhyping their frameworks

03:16:46
nexxeln: sorry big wall of text

03:16:46
yuji_rexion: your aws cloud certification is neat

03:16:53
teej_dv: NEXT JS JUST HAD A WANNABE APPLE CONF AND SHIPPED HALF BAKED FEATURES

03:16:56
tayloreddev: jquery much simpler times

03:17:00
ad0ran: you ever play around with elixir + phoenix ?

03:17:01
<transcript>: Yeah. I mean, that's that's another thing. I think we all get very excited. I get very excited about whatever I'm using at the moment. Look at me being all measured and trying not to Stoke the flames of drama. Normally, I really like the flames of drama. It's kind of my thing. I enjoy it a lot, whether I portray that externally or not. I'm really excited by drama. But.

03:17:06
ad0ran: @TayloredDev best of time

03:17:07
<transcript>: I do think I've gotten a little too rash, a little too like jump to conclusions.

03:17:08
ad0ran: s

03:17:08
shadyendless: Ryan touched a bit on his personality and such with the stress of trying to make Remix profitable and stuff. Not to say he is going to be any different, but yeah. Hard to know.

03:17:08
oetziofficial: @teej_dv yep

03:17:11
<transcript>: In the last 48 hours, I should probably come down.

03:17:16
<transcript>: Dax met me on Twitter. You must like smug jerks. I guess so.

03:17:16
<transcript>: enhance

03:17:22
<transcript>: Enhance that Dev. So enhance that Dev is another thing I want to check out. I like.

03:17:22
<transcript>: i like

03:17:23
<transcript>: I like architect.

03:17:23
<transcript>: i played with architect

03:17:25
<transcript>: I played with architect.

03:17:25
<transcript>: and this is

03:17:28
<transcript>: And this is by the same people that make architect.

03:17:30
<transcript>: They definitely have a view of the world.

03:17:30
<transcript>: in i mentioned

03:17:34
shadyendless: I personally just really, really enjoy working with Remix :)

03:17:35
teej_dv: (but i know nothing about js frameworks or the ppl behind them LUL just making fun of js land)

03:17:37
<transcript>: In I mentioned earlier like there's people who would just die if they thought about shipping 200 kilbyts of JavaScript on their whatever site.

03:17:37
<transcript>: these

03:17:42
<transcript>: These are some of those people. They're very vocal on the other side of like.

03:17:42
<transcript>: the browser

03:17:45
<transcript>: The browser. It just does it all use platform.

03:17:45
<transcript>: so this

03:17:48
<transcript>: So this is like.

03:17:51
<transcript>: It's the HTML. What I call custom elements.

03:17:52
nestamakunen: ExtJs

03:17:54
<transcript>: So using Web components.

03:17:54
<transcript>: to

03:17:59
<transcript>: To build your apps just with browser stuff. It's very minimal.

03:17:59
<transcript>: like

03:18:01
<transcript>: Like architect.

03:18:02
cowfacedude99: @teej_dv You did write typescript on stream LUL

03:18:04
<transcript>: Haven't played with it yet would like to.

03:18:04
<transcript>: it'd be hilarious

03:18:07
<transcript>: It'd be hilarious. We all circle back to jquery.

03:18:07
<transcript>: vanilla

03:18:09
<transcript>: Vanilla is better.

03:18:09
<transcript>: versell

03:18:11
wuelnerdotexe: @teej_dv be like: JS only for the memes

03:18:11
<transcript>: Versell marketing. Isn't that great, either.

03:18:13
nexxeln: @shadyendless same! remix just feels so fun and i have noticed my code just is better

03:18:14
tayloreddev: @Nestamakunen not heard that in a while

03:18:15
<transcript>: You said this is about Turboproc marketing.

03:18:16
gabrielvlad7: NexttJS 13 is still in alpha, only hype

03:18:22
<transcript>: There were a number rounding issues and the original numbers for the 1000 bonus. First.

03:18:25
ad0ran: would you be interested in qwik.builder.io

03:18:25
<transcript>: Nine.

03:18:25
<transcript>: first got market

03:18:33
<transcript>: First got market is a ten X advantage when the original numbers were closer to 6th people complaining that JavaScript people over hyping the framework.

03:18:35
fredkisss: @nexxeln Yeah for turbopack i didn't really like that part

03:18:39
<transcript>: Cloud Certification is neat.

03:18:44
<transcript>: Thank you. Ug. My ADBs cloud certification. You mean the ones that I can.

03:18:44
<transcript>: i did them

03:18:54
<transcript>: I did them really fast. That's probably what you're talking about. That was neat. Next. Js. Conf or NiXY has just had a wannabe Apple. Comps and shipped half baked features. That's right.

03:18:56
<transcript>: We're angry.

03:18:56
<transcript>: oh wow

03:19:02
nestamakunen: @TayloredDev That's was good

03:19:02
nexxeln: https://github.com/yyx990803/vite-vs-next-turbo-hmr/discussions/8 idk if youve seen this

03:19:02
<transcript>: Oh, wow. I'm so behind on chat. Sometimes you guys just start talking a lot, and then I can't keep up. I gotta start reading. Okay.

03:19:02
<transcript>: going faster

03:19:11
<transcript>: Going faster now lixner and Phoenix Actually, Yes, I have played with luxury in Phoenix. Sat Muse, the whole Web, part of Sat muse.

03:19:11
<transcript>: museum

03:19:12
<transcript>: Museum.

03:19:12
<transcript>: this

03:19:16
<transcript>: This is all Elixir. Phoenix. So it's built with elixir in Phoenix.

03:19:16
<transcript>: that was

03:19:20
<transcript>: That was one of our hires that was really into elixir.

03:19:20
<transcript>: i was not

03:19:24
<transcript>: I was not necessarily, but I had to work with it a lot. So.

03:19:36
<transcript>: Tested been on his personality and such with the stress of trying to make remix profitable and stuff. Not to say he's going to be any different, but yeah, I already know. Yeah, no, I think like he surely taken the breath after the acquisition. That's gonna help, I would think.

03:19:36
<transcript>: like you can be

03:19:45
<transcript>: Like you can be a little more calm about the situation, the landscape. When you know you've, you're just able to focus on building the best thing you can.

03:19:54
<transcript>: I really enjoy working with Remix, but I know nothing about JS Frameworks or the people behind them just making fun of JS land. Yeah. Teach. I more and more. I want to start learning rest. You know what.

03:19:59
<transcript>: Burn, brush the rust book. How do I just pull up.

03:19:59
<transcript>: and i get this

03:20:03
laytanl_: @nexxeln yeah thats very interesting

03:20:04
teej_dv: OMEGALUL

03:20:04
<transcript>: And I get this in a tab because this is I've started reading the book actually on my phone.

03:20:05
terawatthour: oh god and it begins

03:20:09
laytanl_: oh no

03:20:10
<transcript>: But I'm doing it. I'm going into rusty.

03:20:10
<transcript>: you

03:20:13
<transcript>: You've inspired me. You and Prime.

03:20:14
<transcript>: And the rest of Twitch.

03:20:14
<transcript>: i just

03:20:15
yeltrah_: haha

03:20:15
laytanl_: adam

03:20:17
trout_soda: Try Rustlings + The Rust Book

03:20:21
shadyendless: My company is starting a complete rewrite of our Elixir/Phoenix project in Remix today! Excited to get out of that world, personally. Living in TypeScript is better for my company's goals.

03:20:21
<transcript>: I just need a good thing that I want to build. I haven't gotten there yet. I need to think of something, but I want to build. I thought I would do.

03:20:21
<transcript>: i would

03:20:26
<transcript>: I would Port Ffnpeg to rest, you know little weekend project.

03:20:26
cowfacedude99: You should do it on stream LUL

03:20:26
laytanl_: See you in a year

03:20:32
teej_dv: how about a bundler for javascript projects

03:20:36
teej_dv: uberpack

03:20:39
<transcript>: Not really Fsnpig, but like slivers of it. Like that would be a thing. I do a lot of stuff with FFM thing. Like I'm a user of Fsmpeg, I build a lot of media pipelines and do a lot of weird stuff.

03:20:47
<transcript>: And if I could take one simple use case, like creating a podcast from Raw audio, like doing all the audio normalization, something like that.

03:20:47
<transcript>: that's probably why

03:20:59
<transcript>: That's probably why I'll try and do to, like, have a thing I'm trying to do in rest, but I always have to have, like, a thing that I really want to do. It can't just be, like, a thing. I'm like, oh, I could do this. That's me. Something I want.

03:20:59
<transcript>: to do

03:21:06
<transcript>: To do like I want this to exist. So I will push through all the stuff to get there. You know, I'm saying.

03:21:13
<transcript>: I'm trying to catch up? I'm trying.

03:21:19
<transcript>: To check Gabriel next 13 is still an Alpha only higher.

03:21:21
nestamakunen: Interface Ad with RUST

03:21:26
fredkisss: @nexxeln But when  people talk about remix they said they learned about 'Web APIs', "progressively enhanced blah blah...". I've tested remix, while i liked their mutation story and their nested layouts, all of other things did not impress me. And now that Next is getting nested layouts and they are working on the mutation story, so i stay on next

03:21:30
mattmancodes: blazinglyfastpack

03:21:31
<transcript>: Would you be interested in Quick? I am interested in Quick, but there's only so much so much brain capacity for interest. You'll be interested in so many things. And I am interested in so many things.

03:21:35
<transcript>: For Turbach. I didn't really like that part.

03:21:43
<transcript>: Verse Turbo pack Yeah.

03:21:43

03:22:02
<transcript>: living

03:22:09
<transcript>: Living in TypeScript is better for my company's goals. You should do it on stream. Oh, I'll totally learn. Rest on stream. I will. I will definitely do that.

03:22:09
<transcript>: how about

03:22:16
<transcript>: How about a bundler for JavaScript project? Stop it, stop it. Deeds. Uber Peck. I love it.

<transcript>: Well, thank you for the follows. Snickles.

teej_dv: and does overlays, and i have lots more ideas for it

03:22:57
<transcript>: Active directory. That's the thing that does theme songs and whatnot for your stream.

03:23:01
<transcript>: I didn't know it's called Subd. I've seen you work on the theme song stuff.

03:23:01
<transcript>: does overlay

03:23:02
teej_dv: it's all in rust :)

03:23:12
<transcript>: Does overlays have lots more ideas for it. Ooh, and it's all in rust. This sounds awesome. Tee, I'm in. I'm in. I want to watch. Are you working on it today.

03:23:12
<transcript>: i mean

03:23:14
teej_dv: and open source, of course

03:23:15

03:23:19
<transcript>: and open source

03:23:21
laytanl_: I made hangman in rust once

03:23:22
<transcript>: And open source, of course. Let's look it up, tie.

03:23:22
<transcript>: sub

03:23:24
<transcript>: Subd.

03:23:27
teej_dv: probably not today -- hopefully going to record a youtube video for the first time in months

03:23:27
<transcript>: This is what you use.

03:23:27
<transcript>: is it

03:23:30
<transcript>: Is it called subdi on GitHub.

03:23:30
<transcript>: or do you

03:23:33
<transcript>: Or do you use like Bitbucket.

03:23:33
<transcript>: why are you

03:23:34
wuelnerdotexe: ðŸ¦€

<transcript>: Source graph.

03:23:41
teej_dv: it's tjdevries/subd on github

03:23:45
<transcript>: Recorded YouTube video for the first time in months. Ooh.

03:23:47
<transcript>: Subdi on GitHub. Let's see.

03:23:47
<transcript>: so

03:23:55
<transcript>: So this is what it specifically powers all your Twitch, a place, or reward your subscribers from any platform. Okay, okay.

03:23:55
<transcript>: to create an

03:24:02
<transcript>: To create an interactive experience for viewers on any platform and support your sports regardless for where they support you. Oh, so it's not just for Twitch.

03:24:02
<transcript>: okay

03:24:08
<transcript>: Okay, okay. Have to integrations with OBS Prowurse Twitch ads which moderation.

03:24:09
cowfacedude99: @teej_dv any spoilers?

03:24:11
<transcript>: Youtube Neovan Who knows cool.

03:24:14
teej_dv: yeah, it also has (super basic) support for github sponsors.

03:24:21
<transcript>: So I need to see more of this. I didn't know this was like a broader thing. I just thought you, like, made your overlays and, like, did some cool stuff.

03:24:21
<transcript>: because

03:24:24
teej_dv: so you can get themesong if you'rea github sponsor OR twitch sub

03:24:25
<transcript>: Because I definitely went down that road. But this is like broader.

03:24:26
laytanl_: Are you still working on vim9jit @teej_dv ?

03:24:33
teej_dv: (since github sponsor doesn't take any cut of money PogChamp )

03:24:34
<transcript>: It also has super basic word for GitHub sponsors so you can get them get themed ongoing if you're a GitHub sponsor or Twitch sub, interesting. Okay.

03:24:34
<transcript>: i

03:24:36
<transcript>: I wanna see more.

03:24:41
<transcript>: I made hangman in restaurants. That sounds fun.

03:24:43
<transcript>: Call it thrust.

03:24:44
fredkisss: @nexxeln form working without JS  is not a revolution (IMO),  it is a simple thing to do. And when people will replicate that they will say that people stole their idea

03:24:47
laytanl_: You had a month of neovim funding for it, right?

03:24:52
teej_dv: @laytanl_ yes, we will do a bit more work on that this month, hopefully get a PR merged maybe even to neovim core w/ some generated code

03:24:57
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah, I need a thing? I need a thing? So you need to inspire me? Teach? Inspire me with your subdiv? I need to sing that I'm excited to do with rest.

03:25:05
<transcript>: We'll do a bit more on that this month. Hopefully get a Prmers, maybe even new ViMP Four with some generated code.

03:25:05
<transcript>: oh the vin nine

03:25:07
nexxeln: @nexxeln good luck doing that in next.js

03:25:07
<transcript>: Oh, the Vin Nine G. Yeah, I saw that.

03:25:09
<transcript>: Okay.

03:25:09
<transcript>: what i want to do

03:25:11
<transcript>: What I want to do, I want to.

03:25:13
bheet: Solana Scam Coin

03:25:14
thdxr: a cli command where you can save your favorite color to file then load it later

03:25:16
teej_dv: @adamdotdev i have some ideas -- we should get on a call offstream to talk about it tho

03:25:21
<transcript>: We're done? Are we done with Next 13? Are we done kind of looking through all that. I want to look at dynamic HTML streaming.

03:25:25
<transcript>: Server components.

03:25:25
<transcript>: so we play with the

03:25:32
nestamakunen: @teej_dv neovim mastger

03:25:33
teej_dv: @laytanl_ yeah, i just finished up 1 month full time on it (did a lot of work offstream on it as well).

03:25:33
<transcript>: So we play with the App directory we played with Next font. I didn't check any of the new Next image stuff, but it didn't sound. It mostly sound like just.

03:25:36
nexxeln: https://github.com/yyx990803/vite-vs-next-turbo-hmr/discussions/8 look at this @adamdotdev

03:25:40
<transcript>: Smaller, faster, stronger, that kind of thing. It didn't sound like big feature changes to the next image.

03:25:45
<transcript>: We've seen the complex routing and layouts. I mean, look at this thing.

03:25:45
<transcript>: some

03:25:50
<transcript>: Some complex routing and layouts. So like the ISR stuff.

03:25:53
<transcript>: I assume.

03:25:53
<transcript>: let's just

03:25:59
<transcript>: Let's just look at where they're calling fetch. I haven't really looked at many examples of fetch.

03:25:59
fredkisss: @nexxeln DId you see rakkajs ? It does exactly that a Form component, so why wouldn't it not be possible with next ?

03:26:05
<transcript>: Like Fetch Category by slug.

03:26:09
<transcript>: Let's go into that. What is that doing? Let's get category do.

03:26:09
<transcript>: no

03:26:16
<transcript>: No, I hate when this thing comes up, tee. I get so frustrated every time the quick list thing comes out because I don't know what I'm doing.

03:26:18
<transcript>: What's.

03:26:18
<transcript>: really easy workflow

03:26:22
<transcript>: Really easy workflow for just like I want to get rid of the quick list thing.

03:26:24
teej_dv: you can just close it w/ ":q"

03:26:26
<transcript>: It's so confusing.

03:26:28
<transcript>: Quickness, comes up.

03:26:28
<transcript>: q

03:26:29
<transcript>: Q.

03:26:30
teej_dv: or ":cclose" i think

03:26:33
<transcript>: Oh, look at me. I'm just derailed completely.

03:26:36
nexxeln: dude do it lol, all im saying its built in remix

03:26:37
<transcript>: I'm so lost. Q.

03:26:41
<transcript>: Oh, what I do now.

03:26:48
yuji_rexion: cclose

03:26:51
<transcript>: All I have is.

03:26:52
cowfacedude99: ;cclose

03:26:54
teej_dv: yeah, it's ":cclose"

03:26:57
<transcript>: That's the only thing open right now. Can I close the last window? That's awesome.

03:26:57
<transcript>: okay

03:27:01
<transcript>: Okay. It's gone now. Oh, I hate that thing.

03:27:16
<transcript>: Did you see Raccus? J. Rashajs? Is exactly that a form from that. So why wouldn't have these muzzles next? You guys are so talking about like Remix versus Next, aren't you.

03:27:20
yuji_rexion: need to map that badboy

03:27:21
laytanl_: I use quickfix list a lot in combination with telescope

03:27:29
<transcript>: Oh, tea, Mr. Messers. Yes. I would love you to call a stream to talk about it. I would love to hear your ideas, ideas, DAX, let's see how I command where you can save your favorite color to file, then load it later.

03:27:32
cowfacedude99: @laytanl_ me too.

03:27:33
<transcript>: Save your favorite color to file.

03:27:33
<transcript>: then load it

03:27:37
<transcript>: Then load it later. Are you trolling? Dax, explain.

03:27:37
<transcript>: yourself

03:27:38
<transcript>: Yourself.

03:27:42
thdxr: yes

03:27:47
yuji_rexion: really useful feature, especially with telescope

03:27:47
thdxr: I figure that's a good beginner rust project

03:27:49
thdxr: lol

03:27:52
<transcript>: Need to map that bad boy. Yeah, I need to map C clothes to, like, escape.

03:27:58
<transcript>: Use quickfix list a lot and kind of with telescope oh really.

03:28:00
<transcript>: Now I feel like I'm missing something.

03:28:03
shiftlessatol: Dear diary: I made it back twice now

03:28:05
<transcript>: Good beginner rest project. So, DAX, you're saying.

03:28:05
<transcript>: like color

03:28:10
<transcript>: Like color picker like from your monitor. Choose it and put it in a file.

03:28:17
<transcript>: Or like an actual color picker in red. I don't even know how you do like visual stuff and rest.

03:28:17
<transcript>: sure

03:28:19
<transcript>: Sure. There's some libraries.

03:28:21
thdxr: no `savemyfavecolor blue`

03:28:24
<transcript>: For Graphics. David's. Here.

03:28:24
<transcript>: so save

03:28:29
shiftlessatol: set it in water

03:28:34
cowfacedude99: Once you get good mappings, it is a breeze to move around fixing in stuff

03:28:35
thdxr: Rust is hard!

03:28:42
<transcript>: So save my favorite color blue. Oh, you're just saying, like, just like, this is an easy thing. I could say blue to a text file and then reload blue later. So my thing backs is I won't really stick with learning a thing if I don't really want the thing to exist so I can come up with like to do apps and like dumb stuff I could build.

03:28:51
thdxr: what if you forget your favorite color?

03:28:51
<transcript>: But if it's not a thing, I really want to exist, the learning will not be as good. I would really push through and learn obscene amounts of information and like.

03:28:51
<transcript>: do weird

03:28:55
trout_soda: yeah a simple CLI if you've never worked in a memory safe language

03:28:59
shiftlessatol: and animal proteins for food!

03:28:59
<transcript>: Do weird stuff and spend way too much time on things. If there's a reason I want to do it, but I have to have a good reason. Does that make sense.

03:28:59
<transcript>: but

03:29:06
<transcript>: But if you forget your favorite color, you're making a compelling argument. X you're starting to get me hyped about this app.

03:29:06
<transcript>: once

03:29:11
<transcript>: Once you get good mapping is a breeze and move around fixing and stuff interesting.

03:29:11
<transcript>: simple c

03:29:17
wuelnerdotexe: @teej_dv honestly after a long time using vim and neovim, i think the most valuable functionality for neovim is the "stickybuffers" for the pseudo-interfaces, and avoiding what just happened to adam, is really very annoying, what do you think??

03:29:24
shiftlessatol: "I don't spend time on things I don't want to exist"

03:29:31
<transcript>: Simple CI. If you've never worked in a memory safe language. Yeah. No, I definitely just think I want to build a CLI. I just need one that I really want to exist. So, like, FFmpeg is super hard and complicated. It's like a million things. But if there's a sliver of FFmpeg, that's a CLI app I can build in rest. And, like, wrap my head around. I'm gonna pass an audio file. I'm gonna get out an audio.

03:29:31
<transcript>: file with

03:29:35
<transcript>: File with like loudness normalization.

03:29:35
<transcript>: or something

03:29:36
<transcript>: Or something.

03:29:37
teej_dv: @WuelnerDotEXE i don't know what you're saying

03:29:39
<transcript>: Or.

03:29:39
<transcript>: i thought about

03:29:43
<transcript>: I thought about CLI apps for some stuff I want to do for AWS.

03:29:54
<transcript>: Those just seem like less like Python advantage of rest because they're like making SDK calls. And like, I don't know, I can do that in TypeScript. And who cares.

03:29:54
<transcript>: i want to do something

03:29:56
trout_soda: I just worry that working with disk memory and streaming in Rust is really really hard.

03:29:57
<transcript>: I want to do something in rest that takes advantage of rest. You know what I'm saying.

03:30:04
passingremarks: rust api that wraps ffmpeg

03:30:05
<transcript>: An animal. Proteins. For food. Stop It, Dave.

03:30:08
<transcript>: Simple CLI. Okay, I read that.

03:30:12
passingremarks: would be dope imo

03:30:14
<transcript>: I don't spend time on things. I don't want to exist. That's right.

03:30:14
<transcript>: kind of

03:30:16
<transcript>: Kind of.

03:30:22
<transcript>: I just worry that working with this memory and streaming and rest is really, really hard.

03:30:34
teej_dv: @passingremarks that exists already i'm pretty sure

03:30:38
<transcript>: Passing remarks. Welcome to Chat Rest API that wraps Efficient pig would be dope I'm saying like rewrite FFN pig in Rust, but only specific like FFmpeg is this giant thing that does so many different things.

03:30:38
<transcript>: there

03:30:42
<transcript>: There's a theme, like working with media.

03:30:42
<transcript>: but

03:31:02
<transcript>: But if you just take you take an individual use case. Like, I'm right. I'm making a podcast. And at the end of me and DAX recording a podcast, there's two audio files, and they're raw. And I need to level the audio. I need to, like, not compress, but like, set loudness to a certain like, standard. Okay. For both the audio tracks, then I need to.

03:31:02
<transcript>: mix them

03:31:03
passingremarks: @passingremarks dope, i'll go look it up lol

03:31:17
<transcript>: Mix them together and I need to add music to the beginning. In the end. These are things that are like my specific use case. I could build a little rust CLI that just does that thing and it's like free writing FFmpeg if you were only writing like a tiny sliver of F of MPEG, does that make sense.

03:31:24
<transcript>: And I'm pretty sure someone's already porting all of Ffbeggin to rest. I think I saw a project.

03:31:24
<transcript>: i

03:31:30
wuelnerdotexe: @teej_dv This functionality but native: https://github.com/stevearc/stickybuf.nvim

03:31:34
<transcript>: I think thank you for the follow snicks. Ellis and DurhamA, Dermix and Amy Lou. I think I'm getting into people. I already said.

03:31:34
<transcript>: thanks for

03:31:38
<transcript>: Thanks for Solve cranberry wine. Why aren't I listening to music.

03:31:46
cranberrywine: <3 yw

03:31:49
<transcript>: Okay, next 13. I think I have enough information now about next 13 to kind of formulate my thoughts, make my stack decisions.

03:31:55
<transcript>: We're gonna learn Rust. We're gonna do it. Not right now, though.

03:31:59
<transcript>: Oh, you want to see my.

03:32:01
teej_dv: @WuelnerDotEXE just dont use filetrees LUL

03:32:04
<transcript>: Let me show you since the people who showed up yesterday.

03:32:04
<transcript>: because

03:32:07
teej_dv: this is a problem I have never had

03:32:09
<transcript>: Because I feel bad for all those who came yesterday. Where is it.

03:32:11
<transcript>: This thing.

03:32:17
<transcript>: If you watched me fumble around with stable diffusion yesterday and you get to see any kind of payoff.

03:32:17
<transcript>: it was all just

03:32:25
<transcript>: It was all just like talk. And no, no, anything good happening here is stable. Diffusion.

03:32:25
<transcript>: model

03:32:27
shiftlessatol: what about ATELIERE ?

03:32:32
<transcript>: Model I've trained on status illustrations. Okay, so little backstory, Sam, use.com.

03:32:36
wuelnerdotexe: @teej_dv neryadNotsure

03:32:38
<transcript>: It's like Sports stats. Okay. We started this eight years ago with my lifelong friends.

03:32:42
<transcript>: And it's like search like, who has the most.

03:32:49
<transcript>: Blocks in a game, you just like ask stats, questions and you get.

03:32:52
<transcript>: Like these kind of answers. Okay.

03:32:52
<transcript>: but

03:32:55
<transcript>: But Elmore, look at that.

03:32:59
<transcript>: There are all these player images.

03:33:12
teej_dv: the bar for including something in core is VERY high. people should adjust their expectations for how likely something makes it to neovim core.

03:33:14
nexxeln: does most of your income come from statmuse

03:33:17
benanna19: Chris Biscardi is a great educator and is teaching rust over at Rust Adventure - https://www.rustadventure.dev/workshops

03:33:19
<transcript>: We've hired his name's Michael Wallchuck. He's worked there for, like, he's worked there longer than I have. He's been at Satin's longer than I mean, I was there at the beginning, but I haven't been there for three years. For, like, seven years. He's just been drawn these player illustrations. And there are thousands of them across a bunch of different sports, like so many of them. And he draws these all day. He drive.

03:33:19
<transcript>: drives like

03:33:21
thdxr: Adam is trying to replace this artist with an AI

03:33:21
<transcript>: Drives like two or three a day.

03:33:21
<transcript>: but

03:33:28
<transcript>: But now we have this huge library of all these illustrations. So I made a model with Dream booth.

03:33:28
<transcript>: so i took

03:33:31
<transcript>: So I took a sample of 20 of them.

03:33:35
<transcript>: And I put them on 512 by 512 canvas like this.

03:33:35
<transcript>: and i

03:33:40
<transcript>: And I trained a model with this Colab notebook. Right here.

03:33:40
<transcript>: which i'm

03:33:42
<transcript>: Which I'm still using.

03:33:42
<transcript>: thirteen for

03:33:45
laytanl_: lol putting him out of a job

03:33:46
<transcript>: 13 for our awesome. I've just been burning through these all day. Cool.

03:33:46
<transcript>: and

03:33:55
cowfacedude99: @teej_dv I remember harpoon having these issues. but they added guards for those.

03:33:57
<transcript>: And now I can train. I can say, like my Trout official headshot. He's a baseball player in Statini style. So I trained it to know what statino style is. Okay.

03:33:57
<transcript>: and

03:34:11
<transcript>: And now it can spit out images that look like Stat Muse illustrations. Isn't that crazy? Like that? Looks like Waltoc drew. It kind of not as good, but like I just said that. And it's bit that out. How crazy, right.

03:34:11
<transcript>: is this crazy

03:34:12
<transcript>: Is this crazy.

03:34:12
<transcript>: i'm not trying to

03:34:14
<transcript>: I'm not trying to replace the artist.

03:34:14
<transcript>: wall chuck is

03:34:25
yuji_rexion: Fuuuutuuuuuuuree

03:34:30
<transcript>: Wall Chuck is a dear friend of mine. He will always have a job at San Use. There is no like trying to cut down on it's. More like trying to amplify, giving him a better bicycle. You know, I'm saying, like Steve Jobs, the bicycle for the Mine. This is computer. Is this is a better bicycle for a creative.

03:34:30
<transcript>: to blow

03:34:44
<transcript>: To blow out the number of illustrations they can do in a given day, month, year, whatever. Because there's so many different things that we would illustrate if we just had more wall talks. So we're more of him in the world. And now maybe there is maybe.

03:34:44
<transcript>: we just had

03:34:46
<transcript>: We just had a Robot. How to Be Michael waltzuck.

03:34:52
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Creme. Berry wine.

03:34:58
<transcript>: The bar from including something in Core is very high. We're talking about ne. Of them.

03:34:58
<transcript>: most of

03:35:01
<transcript>: Most of your income come from Statmes. Next.

03:35:01
<transcript>: so

03:35:02
<transcript>: So.

03:35:05
wuelnerdotexe: @teej_dv It also happens with terminals, and dapui ("irreplaceable" plugins) ðŸ˜”

03:35:06
<transcript>: It's complicated.

03:35:13
<transcript>: So for, like six months, I've done no work. I've had $0 of income.

03:35:17
<transcript>: The first six months of the year.

03:35:17
<transcript>: i was

03:35:18
<transcript>: I was doing consulting.

03:35:29
<transcript>: And I've recently taken a job to go back to Statmeues. So moving forward, most of my income will be from sat mes, which is to say the only income I'll have will be from statmeues.

03:35:29
<transcript>: so yes

03:35:30
<transcript>: So Yes.

03:35:37
<transcript>: Chris Bascarney is a great educator, is teaching Rust over at Rust adventure.

03:35:43
nexxeln: very cool

03:35:43
<transcript>: Welcome to no, not welcome to chat. I sometimes get my wires crossed like I think.

03:35:45
laytanl_: @WuelnerDotEXE can't you just move to your "main/other" buffer and open it there

03:35:48
<transcript>: Someone in their chat but know someone just followed me. Thank you for the follow signs. Pass.

03:35:52
<transcript>: And Gabriel, if I didn't say that, right? Oh, excuse me.

03:35:58
laytanl_: I use all those plugins and don't really have a problem

03:36:00
<transcript>: Remember Harpoon having these issues. You guys are taught myself. I don't know. I don't know what we're talking about.

03:36:02
<transcript>: Future.

03:36:10
<transcript>: Can't you just move to your main other buffer? You guys are still talking about you guys in your Neil them? I don't know what she's talking about.

03:36:12
teej_dv: i just feel like you shouldn't open the files from those windows. And sometimes I want to open it in a terminal. :)

03:36:16
<transcript>: I know you're talking about Neil Vin Plugins. Let's try another player who knows of an athlete.

03:36:19
<transcript>: Who's an athlete.

03:36:20
shiftlessatol: what about ATELIERE

03:36:23
<transcript>: Lionel Messi. I spell that.

03:36:23
cowfacedude99: I think having a it into plenary would be nice so that everyone does not have to reimplement it. but adding it to core would take time. @WuelnerDotEXE

03:36:26
<transcript>: To be international friendly here.

03:36:28
<transcript>: Atelier.

03:36:31
<transcript>: Athaleer is that an athlete.

03:36:40
shiftlessatol: framework

03:36:41
shiftlessatol: OTT

03:36:42
<transcript>: Let's see if Lionel Messi, do I spell that right.

03:36:47
<transcript>: Wow, it's a creepy, messy illustration.

03:36:47
<transcript>: if ness

03:36:49
cowfacedude99: Sachin Tendulkar @adamdotdev

03:36:50
<transcript>: If Nessie were purple.

03:36:50
<transcript>: cool

03:36:51
<transcript>: Cool.

03:36:51
shiftlessatol: previously OwnZones

03:36:54
<transcript>: It's working kind of.

03:36:58
<transcript>: Satchin.

03:36:58
<transcript>: let's

03:37:05
<transcript>: Let's try this Satchin, please make sure you spell their name right? Because I don't know if the model like misspellings.

03:37:05
<transcript>: i'm gonna assume

03:37:07
<transcript>: I'm gonna assume that's right. Here we go.

03:37:07
<transcript>: the mess

03:37:17
<transcript>: The messy one is pretty creepy, but awesome. Pretty stat Museum. That looks like the sad me style. Like right. If you weren't purple, I don't know why he's purple.

03:37:19
<transcript>: But I want to save that one.

03:37:28
<transcript>: I don't know what happens when I hit save.

03:37:28
<transcript>: apparently nothing

03:37:29
<transcript>: Apparently. Nothing.

03:37:34
laytanl_: looks like a zombie

03:37:38
<transcript>: Oh cool download PNG that won't get overwritten.

03:37:47
<transcript>: Okay, let's try this guy. Who is this Satchin? Is this F one? Yesterday everyone was trolling me with F one people that I don't know anything about.

03:37:50
<transcript>: Looks like a zombie. Yeah. Kind of.

03:37:58
<transcript>: They're all purple is what's interesting. Like every one of them. I gotta look up his Lionel messy, official.

03:38:03
cowfacedude99: he was one of the OG cricketers from india

03:38:05
<transcript>: Headshot. Because that's what I'm putting in the prompt. Let's see what as you look purple in his headshot. No.

03:38:05
<transcript>: none

03:38:09
<transcript>: None of these look purple. Cool. The robot.

03:38:13
<transcript>: Are going crazy. Is this what he looks like.

03:38:15
<transcript>: Is Satin's artist drew him.

03:38:18
shiftlessatol: Jersy color

03:38:18
<transcript>: Og Cricketers? Does that look like him.

03:38:21
shiftlessatol: will cast hues

03:38:26
wuelnerdotexe: @teej_dv I understand, sorry if we don't value your work enough.  I was just saying it because I really love Neovim and I think a solution to that should be a priority, because it's about UX...

03:38:29
laytanl_: do "Max Verstappen"

03:38:29
<transcript>: Jersey Color will Cast Hughes. Interesting. Make sure to follow the Andro.

03:38:32
<transcript>: I gotta watch the time.

03:38:32
<transcript>: max

03:38:36
<transcript>: Max verse seven. Can someone tell me if this looks like this person.

03:38:37
cowfacedude99: not much...

03:38:38
nexxeln: no ðŸ’€

03:38:39
<transcript>: I could look him up, I could Google them, I guess.

03:38:43
<transcript>: Not much bummer.

03:38:45
<transcript>: Let's try this guy.

03:38:45
<transcript>: ma

03:38:49
<transcript>: Max for stepping.

03:38:49
nexxeln: wtf happened there ðŸ’€

03:38:53
thdxr: yeah yeah do max verstappen

03:38:55
wuelnerdotexe: @laytanl_ "Checo is a legend" ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½

03:38:56
<transcript>: What happened there? Oh, that doesn't look anything like this person.

03:38:57
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:38:57
<transcript>: these are not great

03:38:59
<transcript>: These are not great.

03:38:59
<transcript>: and they don't

03:39:02
<transcript>: And they don't look the same. So I don't think they're very good.

03:39:02
<transcript>: not all of these

03:39:04
<transcript>: Not all of these turn out that way.

03:39:04
texoport: image 4 looks somewhat like him

03:39:08
<transcript>: Does that look like Max? Verse tapping.

03:39:09
teej_dv: @WuelnerDotEXE i'm saying: if a plugin easily solves the problem for people who have the problem why should it not continue to be a plugin? (I'm not offended, don't worry)

03:39:11
shiftlessatol: Mr. Bean!!!

03:39:12
thdxr: LOL

03:39:14
laytanl_: yeah kinda

03:39:15
thdxr: the last one probably best

03:39:16
<transcript>: Kind of.

03:39:17
thdxr: so ugly though

03:39:23
<transcript>: I don't know what's going on with this hat. Is he sponsored by Red Bull? By chance.

03:39:23
<transcript>: or

03:39:24
<transcript>: Or.

03:39:24
<transcript>: bomber

03:39:27
<transcript>: Bomber planes.

03:39:27
laytanl_: yep

03:39:29
laytanl_: redbul

03:39:31
thdxr: yeah he is redbull

03:39:35
<transcript>: So we're not replacing wall chalk. Clearly like Waltoc. Still, he has a job.

03:39:35
<transcript>: but that's

03:39:37
<transcript>: But that's pretty good, right.

03:39:37
<transcript>: if you look at

03:39:39
<transcript>: If you look at the statues.

03:39:39
<transcript>: illustration

03:39:44
<transcript>: Illustrations like it's captured the style and it's transferring it.

03:39:55
<transcript>: The prompts are really the key. I may just be doing bad prompts. I'm trying like I thought the official headshot would somehow maybe like find the right source image, you know.

03:40:01
<transcript>: There's not a way to just, like, pass it in images. There like where I could say.

03:40:01
<transcript>: so there's image

03:40:03
<transcript>: So there's image to image.

03:40:10
<transcript>: So can I Can I do this with image image? Can I say.

03:40:14
<transcript>: That means.

03:40:22
<transcript>: Set news style and then pass an image in here. Maybe. Let's try it.

03:40:22
<transcript>: i don't know if this

03:40:23
<transcript>: I don't know if this works.

03:40:29
shiftlessatol: do it

03:40:31
<transcript>: Let's try it.

03:40:40
<transcript>: Alright. Here we go. Generate.

03:40:47
<transcript>: What we think, guys.

03:40:50
<transcript>: See the similarity.

03:40:52
<transcript>: No.

03:40:52
<transcript>: what

03:40:53
wuelnerdotexe: @laytanl_ Sometimes it happens by accident...

03:40:54
kedemel: LUL

03:40:56
<transcript>: What am I supposed to do in the prompt? Can I just do the same prompt.

03:40:56
<transcript>: but with

03:40:59
shiftlessatol: LO!!!

03:40:59
<transcript>: But with the source image. I don't know.

03:41:04
nexxeln: LOL

03:41:04
<transcript>: Yeah, he is. Red Bull. Interesting. Okay.

03:41:08
parkour_peter: is it a stable diffusion locally?

03:41:14
shiftlessatol: more better

03:41:15
<transcript>: So it's possible it won't work well outside of America's. American Sports, because I only trained it with American athletes.

03:41:15
<transcript>: so maybe

03:41:16
<transcript>: So maybe.

03:41:16
<transcript>: i don't know

03:41:19
trout_soda: How about Ross Chastain? he just pulled off that wild final turn to go from 10th to 5th in a NASCAR race

03:41:21
<transcript>: I don't know. Maybe it just doesn't know what to do with somebody who drives cars.

03:41:25
teej_dv: also what if you have two athletes with the same name LUL

03:41:30
<transcript>: Image for looks somewhat like I know you're saying that one. Okay, Mr. Bee.

03:41:37
<transcript>: Is it a stable decision locally? No. It's on a I'm using a.

03:41:39
<transcript>: Cloud.

03:41:39
<transcript>: colab

03:41:40
<transcript>: Colab.

03:41:42
<transcript>: Is what this is.

03:41:48
<transcript>: How about Ross Shaft stain? Let's try it. Let's do it.

03:41:51
<transcript>: The nap.

03:41:52
<transcript>: naps

03:41:54
wuelnerdotexe: @cowfacedude99 That would be a good alternative, but I'm not the expert...

03:41:57
<transcript>: Naps. Let's go back to text image. I don't like our chances with the image damage.

03:41:57
<transcript>: i think

03:42:00
parkour_peter: no aws here?

03:42:02
<transcript>: I think you use image image to like refine and like get more detail out of photos.

03:42:10
<transcript>: What if you have two athletes with the same name? Great question. Maybe they'd be a twoheaded monster.

03:42:12
<transcript>: Maybe.

03:42:21
<transcript>: No AWS here no parkour. I've started down the path. If this stuff works and we wanted to wow, it lost the Samue style. What happened.

03:42:24
<transcript>: What.

03:42:24
<transcript>: it lost

03:42:25
<transcript>: It lost.

03:42:25
<transcript>: it just felt

03:42:27
<transcript>: It just felt photos of him.

03:42:33
<transcript>: What happened? I need to clear this out. I feel like I've brought in something.

03:42:36
trout_soda: heh that's not quite there

03:42:37
shiftlessatol: kernel panic

03:42:38
<transcript>: I don't think that would affect this task, but.

03:42:38
<transcript>: in

03:42:41
<transcript>: In statme style. Generate.

03:42:44
<transcript>: What happens here.

03:42:48
<transcript>: Feel like it just like, dropped our model altogether.

03:42:51
<transcript>: Colonel panic.

03:42:57
<transcript>: Yeah. So Parkour. I started building out a model.

03:42:57
<transcript>: or

03:43:03
<transcript>: Or trying to write a Docker file anyway that would do all this stuff on AWS. And eventually I'll get there.

03:43:07
<transcript>: But then I thought I just play with the actual Dream booth today.

03:43:13
<transcript>: I broke the model. It's broke. Oh, wait, wait, no, it's time to checkpoint.

03:43:18
<transcript>: Let me go back to other like.

03:43:19
wuelnerdotexe: @teej_dv Ok I understand.  Anyway thank you for everything you already do for us <3

03:43:21
<transcript>: Athletes. I've done. Lebron James.

03:43:25
<transcript>: If it's just something specific about this guy.

03:43:28
<transcript>: Maybe just hate snaskar.

03:43:30
<transcript>: Can relate.

03:43:45
<transcript>: Wait. Did it do it? Oh, there we go. Okay. So it still knows how to do some athlete.

03:43:47
<transcript>: That's a pretty creepy LeBron.

03:43:49
nexxeln: wow

03:43:49
<transcript>: That's the closest.

03:43:53
trout_soda: heh I don't like NASCAR either but the move he made in that race was rad

03:43:54
<transcript>: It even got Lakers look at that like.

03:43:59
<transcript>: It managed to spell it right. Usually when I see it do words like this. Cax.

03:43:59
<transcript>: that's supposed to be the

03:44:02
<transcript>: That's supposed to be the calves, I think.

03:44:03
<transcript>: Cax.

03:44:03
<transcript>: this

03:44:03
teej_dv: yayaya np @WuelnerDotEXE of course, if you thought of a very elegant way to do this and sent a PR to core, you never know what would happen :) code talks

03:44:07
<transcript>: This is nuts. This blows my mind. Oh, earlier I did.

03:44:07
<transcript>: barack

03:44:09
<transcript>: Barack Obama.

03:44:22
<transcript>: The prompolis was a little different, so I don't know what we'll get here, but I did Barack Obama, and it had him in, like, a basketball Jersey. But it had the presidential seal on it. It was crazy, actually, but it did that.

03:44:27
l3viplayz: its BaraCk with C

03:44:31
<transcript>: What is this? Big blob of day of day? What are you doing? Dropping, like.

03:44:31
<transcript>: bay sixty four

03:44:33
<transcript>: Bay 64. Encoded images in My chat.

03:44:35
shiftlessatol: do it

03:44:37
<transcript>: What is this.

03:44:45
<transcript>: First time Chat welcome. Oh, I spelled Barack Ron. Oh, my bird.

03:44:45
<transcript>: well look

03:44:48
<transcript>: Well, look, it did it right, though.

03:44:48
<transcript>: but i

03:44:50
<transcript>: But I spelled it wrong.

03:44:53
<transcript>: It's like I'm not even from America.

03:44:53
<transcript>: look at these

03:44:55
<transcript>: Look at these, though. That's actually pretty.

03:44:55
<transcript>: close

03:45:01
<transcript>: Close the STATIN's style. Barack Obama let's try it if we actually spell the name right.

03:45:09
<transcript>: It's because I did official headshot. I think before I didn't do official headshot. And I had him in, like, a basketball Jersey.

03:45:10
laytanl_: Yeah these are good

03:45:25
<transcript>: This stuff just amazes me.

03:45:27
<transcript>: Let's take out official headshots.

03:45:32
<transcript>: From Barack Obama in statme style.

03:45:32
trout_soda: def super cool

03:45:48
<transcript>: What else can we do with Stat? Me style? What else could we draw? It doesn't have to be headshots. I'm sure it would work with anything full body stuff.

03:45:48
<transcript>: maybe

03:45:53
<transcript>: Maybe. I don't know. All my source images are like this. So.

03:45:53
<transcript>: it might not

03:45:55
laytanl_: Do a banana

03:45:55
<transcript>: It might not have to do.

03:45:59
<transcript>: Where is it? Here we go.

03:45:59
<transcript>: so

03:46:01
teej_dv: barack obama shooting a basketball in statmuse style

03:46:03
<transcript>: So not doing any of the interesting stuff anymore.

03:46:03
<transcript>: i think

03:46:07
<transcript>: I think I did it lowercase, maybe half of misspelled it so.

03:46:07
<transcript>: i thought

03:46:09
trout_soda: maybe a historical figure like Winston Churchill

03:46:09
<transcript>: I thought it was spelled like that.

03:46:13
wuelnerdotexe: @teej_dv Well, I don't have the level for that, but with help along the way, maybe it would be possible haha \0/

03:46:13
<transcript>: That's why I got bizarre birds.

03:46:15
<transcript>: In a basketball Jersey.

03:46:19
<transcript>: Winston Churchill. That sounds awesome.

03:46:28
<transcript>: Oh, teas with the prompt. Let's do him. Shooting a basketball. I like it a banana. Ooh, I'm interested. You guys are good at this.

03:46:28
<transcript>: let's see

03:46:31
<transcript>: Let's see what a banana looks like in statme style.

03:46:31
<transcript>: okay

03:46:36
<transcript>: Okay, we're going off the rails here. What is all this? What are all these words.

03:46:39
<transcript>: What was this one.

03:46:39
<transcript>: barack obama

03:46:47
<transcript>: Barack Obama shooting a basketball in Sentine style. Let's see. And then we'll do a banana. And then Winston Churchill.

03:46:53
<transcript>: Is so heavily represented in this playlist.

03:46:53
<transcript>: it's kind

03:46:55
<transcript>: It's kind of crazy.

03:47:00
<transcript>: I might just have to remove it all. I said that several times still haven't done it.

03:47:05
trout_soda: oooh Larry Bird

03:47:10
<transcript>: Did it break.

03:47:12
<transcript>: No. There it is.

03:47:16
<transcript>: It's funny.

03:47:19
<transcript>: Like, what do you think.

03:47:26
<transcript>: Not quite.

03:47:27
laytanl_: LUL

03:47:29
<transcript>: Is that Reggie Miller? I think.

03:47:31
<transcript>: Oof.

03:47:31
<transcript>: okay

03:47:37
<transcript>: Okay, so not so good at that. Let's try the banana. A banana. In Stat. New style.

03:47:46
<transcript>: A banana. Banana. I could do less sampling sets. I'm probably making it take too long.

03:47:49
<transcript>: I crank those up to see what it would do.

03:48:02
<transcript>: I love machine learning because I just play with all the buttons. Like I've tried every one of these sampling methods. This one's the best. But I tried them all.

03:48:09
<transcript>: I have no idea what they mean. I don't know what any of this stuff means. I'm just hitting buttons. This is the future. People.

03:48:09
<transcript>: what is going

03:48:11
<transcript>: What is going on.

03:48:11
<transcript>: what

03:48:13
<transcript>: What? What is that banana doing.

03:48:13
<transcript>: it's chasing

03:48:15
<transcript>: It's chasing.

03:48:17
<transcript>: Stan.

03:48:21
laytanl_: hahaha

03:48:24
<transcript>: He's only a football is a football basketball player holding the football, being chased by a really creepy banana.

03:48:27
<transcript>: Okay. So this got.

03:48:27
<transcript>: oddly

03:48:33
<transcript>: Oddly sexual. I don't know what's going on. Let's let's not do bananas anymore.

03:48:35
trout_soda: lol

03:48:38
<transcript>: Let's do what was the other one? So I said, Winston Churchill, Winston.

03:48:40
<transcript>: Church.

03:48:40
<transcript>: hill

03:48:42
<transcript>: Hill like that.

03:48:44
<transcript>: Official.

03:48:49
<transcript>: Headshot like that was a little more stat. Musei.

03:48:49
<transcript>: maybe

03:48:50
<transcript>: Maybe.

03:48:53
<transcript>: Larry Bird. Okay. Yeah.

03:49:02
<transcript>: All right.

03:49:04
<transcript>: I got seven minutes.

03:49:04
<transcript>: we're just finishing

03:49:06
<transcript>: We're just finishing on this stuff.

03:49:11
<transcript>: Okay.

03:49:11
<transcript>: i'm

03:49:12
<transcript>: I'm.

03:49:16
<transcript>: Not really statin'style. That one like.

03:49:16
<transcript>: i don't know

03:49:18
<transcript>: I don't know.

03:49:18
<transcript>: is that

03:49:30
<transcript>: Is that sent me style just like the flat lines. Not quite so it doesn't do as well with nonathletes. It does seem to transfer pretty well when I use actual living athletes so like.

03:49:34
<transcript>: I tried Michael Jordan.

03:49:34
<transcript>: so

03:49:36
<transcript>: So like retired athletes, let's see.

03:50:01
<transcript>: Why is it taking so long? I'm in between, like what's happening right now.

03:50:03
<transcript>: There we go.

03:50:10
<transcript>: The lips are a little weird. That one cut is head off there. But that doesn't look like Michael Jordan. It doesn't.

03:50:16
trout_soda: ha that's not MJ

03:50:18
shiftlessatol: http://inte.ll.igent.design/index.png

03:50:18
<transcript>: So I could train it more with different images. That's an option.

03:50:23
<transcript>: The Lakes Kobe Bryant.

03:50:35
shiftlessatol: do it

03:50:36
<transcript>: What is this one? What did you send me, Dave? You're worrying me. I don't know what to think when you send me images right now, after the base 64 encoded thing. What is this.

03:50:46
<transcript>: What is that? Is that Mr. Bean and sat me stop me style? Wait, are you using did you just pull up this notebook? Are you doing this too? It looks like Kobe kinda.

03:50:46
<transcript>: i

03:50:49
<transcript>: I don't know if it looks like Stat me style.

03:50:52
<transcript>: That looks more like statue style.

03:50:52
<transcript>: less like

03:50:55
<transcript>: Less like Kobe. I don't know. It's doing stuff.

03:50:58
<transcript>: It's definitely trying.

03:50:59
mattmancodes: Ronaldo - it'll be the Brazilian one or the Portuguese one

03:50:59
shiftlessatol: Mr. Bean official headshot in statmuse style

03:51:03
<transcript>: I wonder if I could say, like a fish official. Getty images.

03:51:09
<transcript>: Profile Photo I'm gonna try something like that.

03:51:17
<transcript>: It's like.

03:51:17
<transcript>: it's

03:51:29
nexxeln: a dolphin in official statmuse style

03:51:33
<transcript>: It's a weird mix of like prompt science and understanding how to do correct prompts or good prompts and then also the training side. There's just so many different elements to it, but I've seen people get really, really good results, so I want to play with it more and get better.

03:51:39
<transcript>: Okay. The Getty Images thing maybe threw it off official profile photo. Maybe.

03:51:47
<transcript>: Mr. Bean official headshot in statme style, Ronaldo. Okay, we could try that one.

03:51:50
<transcript>: Adolphin.

03:51:50
<transcript>: an official

03:51:52
<transcript>: An official statme style. We could try that.

03:51:55
<transcript>: Is it frozen.

03:51:58
shiftlessatol: that's what that link was

03:52:08
<transcript>: There's a little delay where it's like it's done, but it's not there we go.

03:52:17
<transcript>: No. What was I gonna. I was gonna try the dolphin. And then we'll try Renaldo.

03:52:22
<transcript>: A dolphin. An official satin style. This does capitalization matter.

03:52:22
<transcript>: that's another

03:52:24
<transcript>: That's another thing I don't know.

03:52:24
<transcript>: like i

03:52:30
<transcript>: Like I've been trying to capitalize them correctly. I just don't know if that helps or hurts or matters at all.

03:52:35
<transcript>: Oh, that's what that link was. Thanks, Dave.

03:52:42
<transcript>: It did Dolphin like the team. The Dolphins.

03:52:50
<transcript>: We got a football player flashback, but these are like Max Mashups of Football and basketball.

03:52:53
<transcript>: Dip in.

03:52:55
shiftlessatol: HA!!

03:52:56
<transcript>: That's creepy.

03:52:58
nexxeln: try goldfish then LUL

03:53:06
<transcript>: So Dolphin, because it's an it's a team. It's a it's a franchise in the NFL. Goldfish. Let's try that. I don't think there are any goldfish teams.

03:53:09
laytanl_: "Adam Elmore in statmuse style"

03:53:18
<transcript>: Adam, Melbourne, Stephen, we can try that. I'll try it. Oh, in official Sami style? We don't want official.

03:53:20
<transcript>: In statme style.

03:53:22
shiftlessatol: he's got an afro

03:53:25
<transcript>: Still try to make an athlete out of it.

03:53:30
<transcript>: That looks. I mean, that looks kind of like Sadie Style, doesn't it.

03:53:30
<transcript>: cult

03:53:34
<transcript>: Cult fish kind of works. Oh, look at this guy.

03:53:34

03:53:36
<transcript>: Is that a golden fish for hair.

03:53:39
<transcript>: What.

03:53:44
<transcript>: That's creepy. The robots are still loose.

03:53:47
nexxeln: wow

03:53:52
<transcript>: Well, is it two words is goldfish? Two words? Let's try Adam Elmore and Sat me style let's see if it knows who I am.

03:53:55
<transcript>: Adam? Omore.

03:53:57
