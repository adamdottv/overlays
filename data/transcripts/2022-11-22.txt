mateusjatenee: morning

00:12:04
cowfacedude99: I finally moved to using a dactyl fulltime yesterday

00:12:11
<transcript>: I thought I was just gonna do like the easy thing. I thought the whole thing with SQL by using Planet Scale in SQL that I'd be like benefiting from it's just SQL so I can just build everything.

00:12:11
<transcript>: query the data

00:12:13
<transcript>: Query the database.

00:12:13
<transcript>: easy

00:12:16
<transcript>: Easy stuff, right? And then I learned.

00:12:21
<transcript>: The planet scale doesn't support well Vitas Vitess vtest.

00:12:29
<transcript>: Whatever that is open source database engine is that they built planets go on doesn't support windowing functions which makes sense. It's like.

00:12:29
<transcript>: distributed

00:12:30
cowfacedude99: I need to find all my keys though LUL

00:12:33
<transcript>: Distributed performant so it can't do that stuff.

00:12:38
<transcript>: So I gotta build it with something else, so Redis retice it is.

00:12:41
<transcript>: Good morning. Matthias.

00:12:41
<transcript>: calf face is here

00:12:43
mateusjatenee: funny you're talking about vitess, i was looking at the source code just now and feeling dumb

00:12:48
<transcript>: Calf face is here. Finally moved to using a DACto full time yesterday. Ooh need to find all my keys though.

00:12:55
<transcript>: Funny. You're just talking about Vitess. I was looking at the source code just now. I'm feeling dumb. That's most source code I look at.

00:13:04
<transcript>: So I just signed up for up stash. I've got the account.

00:13:04
<transcript>: and such

00:13:05
<transcript>: And such.

00:13:09
booptybapty: your stream production quality is ridiculous. how much have you spent on it?

00:13:11
<transcript>: I've got the URL with the password and all that in my.

00:13:17
<transcript>: Int so I won't have to fumble around trying to keep from leaking secrets.

00:13:21
<transcript>: Boop Dubapti Stream production quality is ridiculous. How much have you spent on it.

00:13:21
<transcript>: dollars

00:13:24
<transcript>: Dollars or time.

00:13:30
<transcript>: A lot of.

00:13:36
<transcript>: Both a lot of dollars. A lot of time. A lot of research.

00:13:37
cowfacedude99: @BooptyBapty the first month+ I think

00:13:39
<transcript>: A lot of learning things.

00:13:49
<transcript>: The first month. Yeah, the first month of this Twitch endeavor was just building the Twitch overlays and all that stuff. But.

00:13:49
<transcript>: i had owned all

00:13:53
mateusjatenee: which lens is that adam? 35 1.4?

00:13:55
<transcript>: I had owned all this equipment for like a year before that. I bought all this stuff to start making video stuff.

00:14:02
<transcript>: The lens is on this camera. It is the 35. One, four. That's right.

00:14:08
<transcript>: I use the 35 one eight on one of my other cameras.

00:14:13
<transcript>: And I use a 50 millimeter. One point, whatever. One, two.

00:14:13
<transcript>: one point

00:14:15
<transcript>: One point.

00:14:22
<transcript>: Yeah, that's the two millimeter. One, two on my like when I'm sharing my screen camera. That one.

00:14:25
mateusjatenee: looks great

00:14:25
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow Waja.

00:14:28
<transcript>: I appreciate that follow.

00:14:36
<transcript>: All right. I think we're just gonna get straight into the problem with getting sure when I use this mug.

00:14:36
<transcript>: then i mentioned

00:14:38
<transcript>: Then I mentioned I made this mug.

00:14:45
<transcript>: Didn't make it. I painted it like we went to a place where you like, paint pottery. And then you have a nice.

00:14:45
<transcript>: thing

00:14:47
<transcript>: Thing that you made.

00:14:51
<transcript>: Problem with this mug is it doesn't keep things hot.

00:14:51
<transcript>: so

00:14:59
<transcript>: So if I don't just hang out here for a little bit, I'm gonna drink a very cold drink because I'll set it down. I'll forget about it, work on stuff.

00:14:59
<transcript>: there

00:15:01
<transcript>: There you go. It gets cold.

00:15:07
<transcript>: Does everything to talk about before I start working.

00:15:59

00:15:59
<transcript>: i

00:16:01
the_jolza: Aus might be too far

00:16:02
<transcript>: I won't be streaming Thursday or Friday not because of.

00:16:02
<transcript>: the american

00:16:06
<transcript>: The American Holiday of Thanksgiving, which I don't care about.

00:16:06
<transcript>: at all

00:16:07
<transcript>: At all.

00:16:07
<transcript>: i'm actually

00:16:13
<transcript>: I'm actually kind of like in opposition to Thanksgiving. I think I just, like, dislike Thanksgiving.

00:16:14
<transcript>: But.

00:16:14
<transcript>: i'm not

00:16:20
<transcript>: I'm not gonna be streaming because I'm gonna take a couple days off. I might even take tomorrow off just so spend more time.

00:16:20
<transcript>: with my

00:16:25
<transcript>: With my family before I'm gone for a week. I haven't my three year old.

00:16:25
<transcript>: has never

00:16:29
<transcript>: Has never lived in a world where I travel. I haven't traveled since before.

00:16:36
<transcript>: All the stuff happened 2020, so I think 2019 was less than I flew anyway.

00:16:38
<transcript>: I used to travel a lot.

00:16:38
<transcript>: when we

00:16:47
<transcript>: When we were in the early days of Staff Muse, It was a lot of fundraising, travel and team off sites and whatever, a lot of traffic.

00:16:47
<transcript>: and

00:16:53
<transcript>: And I just had it was before we had my not three year old.

00:17:02
<transcript>: My now seven year old went with us everywhere. I just took my life and my son everywhere. We lived in La several times for months at a time.

00:17:20
<transcript>: Just it'll a lot of traveling, and that was just kind of normal for us. But now it's been three years, three years since I've had to go anywhere. We've hardly left the house for three years because we just kind of like being home. We have our groceries delivered. We get out occasionally, but mostly we hang out here.

00:17:28
<transcript>: So maybe being gone for a week is kind of a big deal. In fact, I was gonna go to Reinvent last year.

00:17:29
sathyabhat: (i'm from Aus as well - will be a long flight)

00:17:33
<transcript>: And it was just gonna be too much for the family.

00:17:38
<transcript>: So Safia is flying from Australia.

00:17:41
<transcript>: That is a long flight.

00:17:43
<transcript>: There's a very long flight.

00:17:48
<transcript>: Is that like a 24 hours flight? G.

00:17:51
<transcript>: So.

00:17:51
<transcript>: i was

00:17:54
<transcript>: I was gonna go last year. It was just gonna be too much.

00:17:54
<transcript>: my two year old

00:17:58
<transcript>: My two year old was brand new. I mean, he was like just turned to so he was.

00:17:58
<transcript>: he was

00:18:00
<transcript>: He was tough.

00:18:00
<transcript>: it was a tough

00:18:01
sathyabhat: 19 hour tz diff between sydney and Pacific  (!)

00:18:05
<transcript>: It was a tough life. We lived. Anyone that has kids, knows what I'm talking about.

00:18:05
<transcript>: nineteen

00:18:09
<transcript>: 19 hours. Okay. Oh, cuz the West Coast. Yeah. That makes sense. Okay.

00:18:15
<transcript>: So still that's a lot.

00:18:17
<transcript>: That's a lot.

00:18:19
<transcript>: I.

00:18:27
<transcript>: The whole conference is gonna be like, turned upside down for you, like morning's, gonna feel like night. And vice versa. Verse of ice.

00:18:27
<transcript>: so

00:18:31
sathyabhat: hah

00:18:33
<transcript>: So I was gonna go last year. Didn't decide at the last minute. And I had everything booked, like, canceled. Everything.

00:18:35
<transcript>: And.

00:18:35
<transcript>: basically

00:18:42
<transcript>: Basically said, okay, I've got to go next year. I really need to go to Reinvent. I need to meet all these people in this community that I'm a part of.

00:18:42
<transcript>: and

00:18:51
<transcript>: And we've had a year to prepare. My family has emotionally been preparing for a year for me to leave for this didn't help.

okufa_f: i'm about to go to sleep how do you feel about that

<transcript>: You're about to go to sleep. Now, that is bizarre. It's wild.

00:19:57
<transcript>: how the world

00:25:22
<transcript>: Is that good.

00:25:27
okufa_f: music can be maybe 10% lower

00:25:29
sathyabhat: good enough

00:25:31
mateusjatenee: i think it'sokay

00:25:33
<transcript>: I'm gonna call that good. Good enough. Okay.

00:25:33
<transcript>: music can

00:25:35
<transcript>: Music can be maybe 10% lower.

00:25:35
<transcript>: some people

00:25:39
zirus16: i dont listen any music

00:25:39
<transcript>: Some people think it's okay. Some people think it could be a little lower.

00:25:44
<transcript>: I can't tell because it's pretty low in my headphones.

00:25:51
<transcript>: Don't listen to any music. Let's see. At what point did you start adding AI Ml into the platform of status.

00:25:53
<transcript>: There's really not.

00:25:53
<transcript>: i don't think

00:25:56
<transcript>: I don't think there really is like the Snap music.

00:26:07
<transcript>: And it's just kind of editorial. So there's no AI or Ml there. So there is like I got.

00:26:11
<transcript>: Like the NLP side is AI I guess.

00:26:11
<transcript>: it's a

00:26:13
okufa_f: is it all elastisearch?

00:26:15
<transcript>: It's a it's under that umbrella of artificial intelligence.

00:26:23
<transcript>: Is it all elastic search? No, it's a proprietary in LP thing.

00:26:29
<transcript>: Proprietary MLP Engine. We call lexatch.

00:26:32
<transcript>: Yeah, it's.

00:26:32
<transcript>: it's written

00:26:34
<transcript>: It's written in F. Sharp.

00:26:34
<transcript>: it

00:26:41
mateusjatenee: fancy uh

00:26:43
<transcript>: It for a long time, dependent on the Stanford NLP suite of NLP libraries. I don't know if it still does. I've been away for a few years.

00:26:43
<transcript>: but

00:26:47
<transcript>: But it is not not elastic. Search.

00:26:53
<transcript>: Okay, let's see that's. Stat. Muse, calm.

00:26:59
<transcript>: Here is AW, guess which is a guessing game that I'm trying to launch.

00:26:59
<transcript>: as part

00:27:01
<transcript>: As part of reinvent.

00:27:01
<transcript>: just

00:27:08
<transcript>: Just a little fun thing for the a bit community I can't get my Dev tools to open for some reason. Window.

00:27:11
<transcript>: Whereas that.

00:27:11
okufa_f: what made ya'll decide to go build your own, instead of elastisearch

00:27:13
<transcript>: File.

00:27:15
<transcript>: How do I.

00:27:15
<transcript>: if my

00:27:18
<transcript>: If my my keyboard shortcut is not working.

00:27:18
<transcript>: how do i

00:27:20
<transcript>: How do I open it.

00:27:22
okufa_f: sorry im just really interested

00:27:28
<transcript>: How? How? View developer tools. There we go. Oh, What's wrong? What? What.

00:27:34
<transcript>: Made you all decide to go build your own and said we'll ask the search.

00:27:37
<transcript>: Well, I don't think.

00:27:37
<transcript>: you could build

00:27:43
<transcript>: You could build Statmeus.com with elastic search so like.

00:27:49
<transcript>: You can do some pretty crazy sports stats questions so like.

00:27:54
<transcript>: What are the most points.

00:27:56
<transcript>: Scored.

00:27:56
<transcript>: i don't know

00:27:57
<transcript>: I don't know.

00:28:06
<transcript>: On the road against the Bucks like you can do some weird Esoteric sports questions.

00:28:11
<transcript>: That on the road versus a buck. Oh, that's career points.

00:28:11
<transcript>: most

00:28:13
<transcript>: Most Points scored.

00:28:13
<transcript>: in a game

00:28:23
<transcript>: In a game or on a road game. In a road game. I don't know. You can ask all these very, like, very highly specific datadriven questions.

00:28:23
<transcript>: and you can't really

00:28:26
<transcript>: And you can't really build I'm like you can really build that with elastic search.

00:28:32
k3ern: Followers Primes Viewers- Buy on viewers. shop

00:28:34
hi6hd: Followers Primes Viewers- Buy on viewers. shop

00:28:37
<transcript>: It also does some other really like complicated NLP stuff.

00:28:37
<transcript>: that i'm

00:28:39
okufa_f: webwon wames

00:28:45
<transcript>: That I'm not illustrating here. These are just like pretty straightforward filters and stuff. But like in a game that's obvious. What if we said.

00:28:45
<transcript>: in

00:28:46
<transcript>: In.

00:28:46
<transcript>: a

00:28:49
<transcript>: A road game.

00:28:56
<transcript>: Lebron had the most points in a road gaming. It's a buck 65 points.

00:28:56
<transcript>: we do

00:28:58
<transcript>: We do all this NLG stuff pretty.

00:29:10
<transcript>: So what first time chat? I'm not gonna look at these chat because I believe I believe your bots think that's what this is.

00:29:10
<transcript>: let's see

00:29:10
elicxlive: Pretty damn impressive

00:29:12
<transcript>: Let's see how do I get rid of you.

00:29:16
<transcript>: How do I get rid of you.

00:29:16
<transcript>: ban

00:29:18
<transcript>: Ban.

00:29:18
<transcript>: b

00:29:19
<transcript>: Ban.

00:29:21
shn4ke: just ban

00:29:23
<transcript>: I'm so Twitch illiterate.

00:29:23
<transcript>: block

00:29:24
daglee: Yeah but can it parse danish? Because no human have been able to do that so far.

00:29:25
<transcript>: Block. Do I block them.

00:29:28
<transcript>: Do I ban them? We'll ban them.

00:29:34
<transcript>: I don't know. It's the differences in banning and blocking. Okay.

00:29:34
<transcript>: and

00:29:36
<transcript>: And your band.

00:29:39
<transcript>: I don't feel bad. Don't think you're humans.

00:29:39
shn4ke: and add message to blocked messages

00:29:42
<transcript>: Okay.

00:29:42
<transcript>: so

00:29:43
<transcript>: So.

00:29:43
<transcript>: but

00:29:48
tiredbeaver: hi, don't forget to mine free crypto on adam.dev !!

00:29:49
<transcript>: But ban can it parse? Oh, but can it parse? Danish? Because no humans have been able to death.

00:29:58
<transcript>: Don't forget to mine. Free crypto on Adam Dev. Wait, wait. Tired, Beaver. I know who you are.

00:30:03
tiredbeaver: LUL

00:30:04
<transcript>: Just messing right? Just trying to like that. Looks like such a spam message.

00:30:10
<transcript>: Wait for mine. Crypto. And Adam Dev. Did I leave something open.

00:30:21
<transcript>: Did I did I have like an API that I left open for this because you now you have me pairing. Did I actually do something where I exposed compute to the open Internet? I would feel bad.

00:30:24
<transcript>: I feel like I did create an API for something.

00:30:32
<transcript>: Oh, ad message to block messages that I.

00:30:38
<transcript>: Already already got rid of it. Can I not see it now? Okay.

00:30:38
<transcript>: well maybe

00:30:40
<transcript>: Well, maybe if it pops up again, we'll do it again.

00:30:41
mateusjatenee: which capture card are you using adam?

00:30:43
<transcript>: All right.

00:30:43
<transcript>: sin of

00:30:46
<transcript>: Sin of status with which capture card.

00:30:46
<transcript>: it's

00:30:49
<transcript>: It's actually the Cam link.

00:30:49
<transcript>: el

00:30:51
<transcript>: Elgato Camlink. 4k.

00:30:54
bodhihawkenmusic: Hahaha, the neverending question, did i expose my api key to the internet

00:30:55
okufa_f: what's preventing you from moving out of th ozarks and moving to a more tech city

00:30:56
<transcript>: Why can't I open the Deadpools? What's going on here.

00:31:01
<transcript>: Review developer like what's this about.

00:31:02
mateusjatenee: thanks!

00:31:04
<transcript>: What.

00:31:07
<transcript>: Let's kill Chrome and reopen it.

00:31:13
<transcript>: Just makes that full screen app.

00:31:13
shn4ke: i can dm the message you if you want I got ffz so I can see deleted messages

00:31:17
<transcript>: Alright.

00:31:18
<transcript>: Chrome.

00:31:25
<transcript>: Nope. I don't want my email open. Nope. I don't want any of that open.

00:31:25
<transcript>: nope

00:31:27
<transcript>: Nope. Sure don't.

00:31:27
<transcript>: oklahoma

00:31:30
<transcript>: Oklahoma, Host. Here we go.

00:31:40
<transcript>: Let's let's get to it. I got a lot to do in today's. Probably the last day. I have to really work on this. So.

00:31:43
<transcript>: We need to we need to figure it out.

00:31:43
<transcript>: so

00:31:47
<transcript>: So I was gonna do leaderboard, I think we're gonna name this query.

00:31:50
spotmonk: background froze for me?

00:31:51
<transcript>: Finish so gain finish.

00:31:54
<transcript>: Or finalize.

00:31:54
<transcript>: we'll call it final

00:31:58
<transcript>: We'll call it finalize. And this cannot be Nolish.

00:31:59
bodhihawkenmusic: yeah same

00:31:59
<transcript>: Right.

00:32:02
mateusjatenee: your editor froze

00:32:04
sathyabhat: same

00:32:04
<transcript>: Has to have that I believe.

00:32:06
tiredbeaver: neojim

00:32:07
<transcript>: Okay. So then resolve.

00:32:07
<transcript>: input

00:32:09
<transcript>: Input.

00:32:15
<transcript>: I think so. To follow a viral.

00:32:18
<transcript>: Viral. My editor froze.

00:32:19
mateusjatenee: bet it wouldn't have happened if it was sublime........

00:32:25
<transcript>: Oh, my screen share froze. It does this occasionally. This is not good.

00:32:25
<transcript>: we gotta fix

00:32:26
<transcript>: We gotta fix.

00:32:26
<transcript>: let's see

00:32:30
<transcript>: Let's see since this and I have to switch screens.

00:32:30
<transcript>: like that

00:32:32
<transcript>: Like that.

00:32:33
<transcript>: Alright.

00:32:33
<transcript>: that fixes

00:32:37
<transcript>: That fixes it. I don't know. It's like a OBS 28 thing or something.

00:32:37
<transcript>: some

00:32:41
<transcript>: Some for some reason, I get that every once a while.

00:32:41
<transcript>: yes

00:32:42
<transcript>: Yes.

00:32:42
<transcript>: okay

00:32:44
<transcript>: Okay.

00:32:45
<transcript>: Cool.

00:32:45
<transcript>: so

00:32:51
<transcript>: So here we are. We're in a finalized query. I guess that'd be a mutation, wouldn't it.

00:32:54
<transcript>: Be.

00:32:54
<transcript>: muta

00:32:55
<transcript>: Mutation.

00:32:55
<transcript>: finalized

00:32:57
<transcript>: Finalized.

00:33:02
<transcript>: Resolve. Okay. So here's what we got to do on this. Here.

00:33:04
<transcript>: Let's just do this.

00:33:13
<transcript>: So what we have to do on finalized is on a Mark. The game is complete.

00:33:13
<transcript>: this help

00:33:16
<transcript>: This helper filtering. I think.

00:33:20
<transcript>: When a Mark begin is complete, and I want to.

00:33:20
<transcript>: return

00:33:24
<transcript>: Return your place your relative place on the leaderboard.

00:33:30
<transcript>: Says there's something else on finalized. Oh, yeah, this is when we'll add it, we'll actually add your score.

00:33:30
<transcript>: to

00:33:32
<transcript>: To.

00:33:33
<transcript>: The.

00:33:43
<transcript>: We'll add your score to the leaderboard. Well, to the Redis.

00:33:43
<transcript>: the

00:33:44
<transcript>: The.

00:33:44
<transcript>: set

00:33:46
<transcript>: Set right.

00:33:57
<transcript>: Background first me I can DM the message you if you want to I got second Seattle message. Oh, I see.

00:33:57
<transcript>: well

00:34:00
hautedense: that queryraw will be hackable ... unless all your code runs on a server

00:34:01
<transcript>: Well, I don't know how to how to ban it from there.

00:34:01
<transcript>: bodie

00:34:02
<transcript>: Bodie.

00:34:02
<transcript>: welcome to

00:34:07
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Never any questions that I suppose my API keeps the Internet exactly.

00:34:15
<transcript>: What's preventing you from moving out of the Ozarks and moving to a more tech city? A Kufa. I am so happy where I live.

00:34:15
<transcript>: we have

00:34:18
<transcript>: We have we built our dream home like a year ago.

00:34:20
<transcript>: So.

00:34:28
<transcript>: I mean this office that I showed a lot. I love it because I was able to design it with the new home build.

00:34:28
<transcript>: we're in a neighborhood

00:34:35
<transcript>: We're in a neighborhood we really love. We lived here. We built a house in this neighborhood before, and we lived here for a few years. We loved it. We came back.

00:34:40
<transcript>: Yeah. We just love this neighborhood. This street has a bunch of kids. Our kids. They do.

00:34:40
<transcript>: they all

00:34:54
<transcript>: They all play together. They run around each other's backyards. We just kind of got it made, and I don't know, I have no, like, I've worked from home and worked remotely with people all over the world my entire career. So I have really no compelling reason to live anywhere else.

00:35:06
<transcript>: Yeah. I love it in the ocean. I mean, there's like, a lot of downsides, mostly, like, socially. I just don't agree with most what everyone around here believes. But aside from that.

00:35:12
<transcript>: If you just don't care about interacting with people in your local proximity.

00:35:14
<transcript>: Then it's great.

00:35:20
<transcript>: This catching up here.

00:35:20
<transcript>: bet it wouldn't have

00:35:23
<transcript>: Bet it wouldn't have happened if it was sublime.

00:35:28
hautedense: I wish i could live in the Ozarks ..

00:35:32
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Hot dense that query Rob will be hackable unless all your code runs on a server. So this code does run on a server.

00:35:32
<transcript>: but

00:35:35
<transcript>: But we're not actually.

00:35:35
<transcript>: we're not actually gonna

00:35:40
<transcript>: We're not actually gonna run this query rock I was I was trying to do some stuff with windowing functions yesterday.

00:35:49
<transcript>: And then learned that the test doesn't support it. So so this is the this finalize here.

00:35:52
shn4ke: https://twitch.tv/moderator/adamdotdev and you can add blocked terms

00:35:53
<transcript>: Well actually add your game that score.

00:36:07
<transcript>: To upstash it'll. Also add any streaks from that game. I want to keep track of highest streak as well. So high score and highest street. So how many in a row did you get right? Maybe I should play a game here. So people who haven't seen what this game is.

00:36:07
<transcript>: so here

00:36:10
<transcript>: So here it is. You look at AWS services.

00:36:10
<transcript>: and you have

00:36:16
<transcript>: And you have to guess which one is. It like you get an ICAR and you have to guess which one it is or which one is.

00:36:35
<transcript>: When you get right answers, you get points based on any streaks. So one point for right answers. But if you have a streak going like right now we've got two. If I get this one, I'll get three points. Okay, so your score kind of can go up really, really big. If you keep getting them in a row, your timer, you get 3 seconds.

00:36:42
<transcript>: Let's see every time you get one right you get three more seconds every time you get one wrong you lose 5 seconds.

00:36:48
<transcript>: Yeah, it's just like there's like 300 database services.

00:36:48
<transcript>: so

00:36:52
<transcript>: So it's kind of like a joke at this point. How many A. Tobis services there are.

00:36:52
<transcript>: and

00:36:53
<transcript>: And.

00:36:53
<transcript>: it's

00:36:55
shn4ke: or you can add to fossa

00:36:58
<transcript>: It's it's just a fun way to see all the different services. I don't know.

00:37:02
<transcript>: This is AW, guest. And.

00:37:02
<transcript>: i'm getting

00:37:05
<transcript>: I'm getting pretty good at it from testing.

00:37:05
<transcript>: haven't

00:37:06
<transcript>: Haven't missed one yet.

00:37:06
<transcript>: oh this one

00:37:11
okufa_f: if i wanted to work for statmuse, and i believed i could be a high value add, do i send resume to you kekw

00:37:14
<transcript>: Oh, this one's kind of new date exchange. I don't actually know. Okay. Yeah, it's not ones. I do know. Then that helps, I guess.

00:37:19
<transcript>: I got like a 300 something yesterday just messing around.

00:37:23
<transcript>: What is this? Oh.

00:37:23
<transcript>: i don't

00:37:25
<transcript>: I don't know what this is.

00:37:28
<transcript>: Managed Services now.

00:37:28
<transcript>: oh

00:37:30
<transcript>: Oh timer Oh.

00:37:33
<transcript>: I did. I got it. Okay.

00:37:41
daglee: Does it fetch dynamically?

00:37:45
<transcript>: Sage maker. We got 1 second. We're flirting with disaster. Here. Location service. I need to make keyboard shortcuts so you can sit one through four and answer that way. Oh, I don't know, I don't know.

00:37:45
<transcript>: express

00:37:50
sathyabhat: the game reminds me of Japanese User group's physical version of this https://github.com/jaws-ug/AWS-Karuta

00:37:50
<transcript>: Express link take it in the timer. Was that too late? Oh, I did get it. Oh, but I don't.

00:38:02
<transcript>: Okay. So that is AW. Guess. Let's see if I wanted to work for Statmes, and I believe that could be a high value ad. Do I send a resume to you? Yeah. Send it to me.

00:38:05
<transcript>: That'd be great actually.

00:38:12
<transcript>: And you can add block terms. Oh, so go to the moderator. Okay.

00:38:12
<transcript>: i wish

00:38:24
<transcript>: I wish I could live in the Osarks. It's pretty great. I think it's underrated. I've got one gig up and down, like five or two my closet. There's fiber running to my server rack. 5ft away from me. It's pretty great.

00:38:27
<transcript>: Does it fetch dynamically.

00:38:27
<transcript>: does what

00:38:29
<transcript>: Does what such dynamically dagly.

00:38:29
<transcript>: the game reminds

00:38:35
<transcript>: The game reminds me of Japanese user groups physical version of this OOH I'm curious copy link.

00:38:43
<transcript>: Oh.

00:38:46
<transcript>: That sounds fun. That's another take on it. Yeah. Let's.

00:38:50
<transcript>: Print it. That's awesome.

00:38:56
daglee: Like the services and alternatives. Does it automatically update when aws creates more services.

00:39:01
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:39:04
<transcript>: I'm gonna open up.

00:39:04
mateusjatenee: gotta hop guys. see ya on the next stream

00:39:06
<transcript>: A stash.

00:39:07
mateusjatenee: or on twitter

00:39:10
<transcript>: See the console.

00:39:11
hautedense: This game will have many applications, maybe some actions for differents companies ..

00:39:12
<transcript>: We're gonna open.

00:39:17
<transcript>: Planet scale.

00:39:19
<transcript>: This one.

00:39:27
toaspick: hi adam what was the name of chart library that responsible with sound. I thing you have used when you developing nextjs stream layout

00:39:35
<transcript>: Cma TS see on the next stream like the services and alternatives. Does it automatically update when a device creates creates more services daglin I seated it with all the icons so I'll need. After reinvent I'll go and see if there's new icons and I'll add them.

00:39:38
<transcript>: But it is an automatic.

00:39:41
<transcript>: This game. I have many applications. Maybe some action.

00:39:46
<transcript>: For different companies you think people companies will want to use this game.

00:39:46
<transcript>: to pick

00:39:56
<transcript>: To pick Hi, Anna, what was the name of Chart Library that responsible with Sound? I think you have used when you're developing next year's stream layout. A Chart library.

00:39:59
<transcript>: Chart library.

00:40:05
okufa_f: highcharts, d3

00:40:05
toaspick: sorry for bad english .D

00:40:09
toaspick: yes yes

00:40:11
<transcript>: You talk about that. Oh, you're good to speak.

00:40:12
hautedense: Some marketing companies could use this game in a table for different events and stuff

00:40:17
toaspick: that one

00:40:18
<transcript>: This one. Yeah, yeah. So I didn't use D three. I can't even remember. Now we ended up with a library.

00:40:18
<transcript>: that was

00:40:19
hautedense: tablet *

00:40:24
<transcript>: That was sort of similar to what we wanted visually. And then we kind of, like, changed it and ported it. So it's all in my GitHub.

00:40:28
<transcript>: You can play with it. Where is that.

00:40:31
adamdotdev: !overlay

00:40:31
toaspick: oh okay thanks

00:40:32
<transcript>: Overlay.

00:40:32
<transcript>: i don't know if

00:40:34
<transcript>: I don't know if I have it on.

00:40:34
<transcript>: let's see

00:40:36
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:40:36
<transcript>: thank you for the

00:40:44
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow clouds 187 so it's https here I'll show I'll give you the link GitHub.com Adam Adam Omore.

00:40:44
adamdotdev: https://github.com/adamelmore/overlays

00:40:47
<transcript>: Overlays I believe.

00:40:49
<transcript>: Did I get it right.

00:40:54
toaspick: thank you very much i ll check

00:40:57
<transcript>: So that is my that's my Twitch overlays. And that would have all the code for that little dancing bar thing I'm really nasally today.

00:41:02
<transcript>: Like I'm kind of a lot of congestion or something.

00:41:11
<transcript>: Okay, so here is our database. Here is I'm just gonna select all from game.

00:41:19
shn4ke: should add commands for faq

00:41:20
<transcript>: Yeah. So here's our games. Now the problem is you can only finalize. You can only add your score if you have.

00:41:30
<transcript>: If you have a user ID. So we're gonna show here if you haven't signed in, we're gonna have this sign in with Twitter button, which I need to style.

00:41:30
okufa_f: have you seen https://www.realapp.link/ ?

00:41:39
<transcript>: You have to sign in to add your score to the leaderboard just to like, identify you. It's not about just doing the three initial thing like classic arcade games, but I don't know.

00:41:39
<transcript>: feels kind of

00:41:48
<transcript>: Feels kind of less than great. I think the community would enjoy seeing who's scored. What got to know if Alex Debris gets a 300.

00:41:55
<transcript>: Have I seen a real app that link? No, I'm curious.

00:41:59
<transcript>: Real app that link.

00:42:05
<transcript>: I've not seen this social sports data discuss predicting compete live on real sports.

00:42:07
<transcript>: I had not seen this.

00:42:10
<transcript>: Blazing Fast Updates, though.

00:42:21
<transcript>: All right, let's get to it. So there's a signin button. Once you sign in, I want to associate.

00:42:31
<transcript>: I want to associate your user with that game, so maybe Finalize will have a game ID and then an optional user ID.

00:42:33
<transcript>: For now.

00:42:33
<transcript>: it'll just get it

00:42:37
<transcript>: It'll just get it from the session. I guess it'll have it on the session at that point, right.

00:42:37
<transcript>: yeah

00:42:38
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:42:40
<transcript>: So okay.

00:42:40
<transcript>: so we're gonna

00:42:43
<transcript>: So we're gonna first get the game.

00:42:47
<transcript>: Do I have like a.

00:42:47
<transcript>: let's have

00:42:50
<transcript>: Let's have like a helper for this forgetting the game.

00:42:56
<transcript>: Should I have one.

00:43:00
<transcript>: Where is. Let's see.

00:43:08
<transcript>: Answer. Does answer get the game now it finds the round. Oh, I see. It includes again. So this is the first time I'm actually getting the game. Okay.

00:43:14
<transcript>: Context. That Prisma, dot.

00:43:14
<transcript>: game

00:43:16
<transcript>: Game.

00:43:18
<transcript>: Find.

00:43:18
<transcript>: unique

00:43:19
<transcript>: Unique.

00:43:25
<transcript>: How's this work? I have to remember.

00:43:29
<transcript>: I'm still I'm new to Prisma. Okay, give me a break.

00:43:30
okufa_f: where:{

00:43:32
okufa_f: data:{

00:43:36
<transcript>: So we're just gonna paste this in here so I can reference it.

00:43:36
<transcript>: let's see

00:43:40
<transcript>: Let's see find unique where.

00:43:40
<transcript>: id

00:43:41
<transcript>: Id.

00:43:41
<transcript>: is

00:43:45
<transcript>: Is input game ID. Okay.

00:43:45
<transcript>: feels good

00:43:47
<transcript>: Feels good.

00:43:47
<transcript>: include

00:43:48
<transcript>: Include going including.

00:43:54
<transcript>: Okay. So that's the game. We found the game.

00:43:58
<transcript>: That's a type game or null.

00:43:59
<transcript>: If.

00:44:02
<transcript>: If not a game.

00:44:08
<transcript>: How do you throw errors? What's the best way to throw errors in T three? I mean in TrpC.

00:44:16
<transcript>: They're like a practice here for.

00:44:25
<transcript>: I'm just doing so many things. Unsafely.

00:44:28
<transcript>: Just assumptions everywhere.

00:44:33
okufa_f: if(!) return works? no brackets/

00:44:34
<transcript>: Okay. Well, I'm gonna look it up. Trpc.

00:44:37
okufa_f: ?

00:44:43
<transcript>: I'm now a TrpC as I'm using version Nine and I feel like all the docs are version Ten. They are BackPress version nine.

00:44:48
<transcript>: I just don't want to, like, take the time to go up to ten right now if there's a bunch of changes.

00:44:50
daglee: I just pushed 2000 lines of unsafe rust. :D

00:44:51
<transcript>: Where data. Let's see.

00:44:56
<transcript>: Should add commands for fact, that's a good idea. Schnake.

00:45:00
<transcript>: Return works, no brackets.

00:45:07
<transcript>: Data. I just push 2000 lines of unsafe rest feels good, Daddy, feel good.

00:45:13
<transcript>: What am I looking for? Error handling. I wanted to do.

00:45:13
<transcript>: pure p

00:45:15
<transcript>: Pure PC.

00:45:17
<transcript>: Errors.

00:45:19
<transcript>: Error handling.

00:45:25
<transcript>: Whenever an error occurs in a procedure, TRC responds to the client with an object. Includes an error property.

00:45:27
<transcript>: Okay.

00:45:30
<transcript>: So should I just throw.

00:45:30
<transcript>: is that the idea

00:45:31
<transcript>: Is that the idea.

00:45:40
<transcript>: Server cannot or will not press as.

00:45:43
<transcript>: Okay. So maybe I'll just.

00:45:43
<transcript>: oh here's

00:45:45
<transcript>: Oh, here's some examples.

00:45:45
<transcript>: throwing

00:45:49
<transcript>: Throwing errors Trip receivers, Eyes an air subpaste TrpC area.

00:45:49
<transcript>: so you can use represent

00:45:54
<transcript>: So you can use represent an error that occurs inside a procedure. Okay. That's good. Let's just do that. Then.

00:45:59
<transcript>: Like this is not just returned null. This is like.

00:46:04
<transcript>: We want to throw.

00:46:04
<transcript>: new

00:46:06
<transcript>: New TrpC.

00:46:06
<transcript>: tr

00:46:10
<transcript>: Trpc errors.

00:46:14
<transcript>: Code.

00:46:18
<transcript>: We'll look at that in a second.

00:46:28
<transcript>: Message? Why is this not? Why am I getting TypeScript? Is this not? Oh, TRPC's not imported or something.

00:46:32
<transcript>: Do I need to import import to your.

00:46:40
<transcript>: Imported. Let's just do this. Let's just import.

00:46:42
<transcript>: From.

00:46:42
<transcript>: import

00:46:44
<transcript>: Import.

00:46:45
<transcript>: To your.

00:46:45
<transcript>: prpc

00:46:47
<transcript>: Prpc.

00:46:47
<transcript>: from

00:46:48
<transcript>: From.

00:46:52
bodhihawkenmusic: haha, ill one up you with a 7000 line pr with no tests PogChamp

00:46:52
<transcript>: Pc Server. Yeah.

00:46:54
almydev: Good morning how are you? What app are you using for music?

00:46:54
<transcript>: Okay.

00:46:54
<transcript>: but

00:46:58
<transcript>: But let's just let's just do this.

00:47:01
<transcript>: Just import TRPC error.

00:47:08
<transcript>: Okay. So now this is going to be.

00:47:08
<transcript>: like that

00:47:10
<transcript>: Like that code.

00:47:10
<transcript>: so is this going

00:47:17
<transcript>: So is this going to have some type ahead? I'm guessing they're pretty good at the TypeScript over there. Timeout conflict forbidden not found bad request.

00:47:20
<transcript>: A bad request.

00:47:23
<transcript>: And then the message will be.

00:47:26
<transcript>: Could not.

00:47:26
<transcript>: find game

00:47:28
<transcript>: Find game with.

00:47:30
<transcript>: Provided.

00:47:30
<transcript>: id

00:47:30
okufa_f: request down bad

00:47:31
<transcript>: Id.

00:47:37
<transcript>: And then the cause will be the error.

00:47:45
<transcript>: Optional pass the original error to retain stackdrise. Oh, yeah, there's no error here. I'm creating the area. Okay.

00:47:45
<transcript>: okay

00:47:49
<transcript>: Okay. So there if there's no game, we throw that right there.

00:47:49
<transcript>: feels good

00:47:51
<transcript>: Feels good.

00:47:56
daglee: @BodhiHawkenMusic Tests? You think I have tests? LUL

00:48:00

00:48:27
tiredbeaver: hackermanz

00:48:28
<transcript>: And the next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna update the game.

00:48:28
<transcript>: so

00:48:30
<transcript>: So we're gonna say.

00:48:30
<transcript>: wait

00:48:33

almydev: I hope you are having a very good day, much encouragement with everything and I keep seeing you in the background <3

00:48:47
<transcript>: We're gonna say.

00:48:49
bodhihawkenmusic: @daglee ahahaha, i mean, i do, they just dont do much BibleThump

00:48:49
<transcript>: Value? What is it.

00:48:55
okufa_f: data

00:48:58
<transcript>: We're gonna say I just got tell me what it needs.

00:48:58
<transcript>: where

00:48:59
okufa_f: it's data

00:49:01
<transcript>: Where we need select include.

00:49:01
<transcript>: where's

00:49:05
<transcript>: Where's Where's the required things data.

00:49:07
<transcript>: Is it data.

00:49:10
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:49:18
<transcript>: Update data. Yeah. So here's the data that we want to update. That's it right. Yeah. Okay.

00:49:22
<transcript>: Scoring increment. Okay.

00:49:24
<transcript>: So data.

00:49:27
<transcript>: We want to update the user ID.

00:49:28
<transcript>: To.

00:49:28
<transcript>: oh okay

00:49:31
<transcript>: Oh, okay. So if there's no user ID.

00:49:31
<transcript>: we're not going

00:49:34
<transcript>: We're not going to add it to.

00:49:34
<transcript>: the thing

00:49:38
<transcript>: The thing. So let's just do context session.

00:49:38
<transcript>: use

00:49:40
<transcript>: User.

00:49:40
<transcript>: id

00:49:41
<transcript>: Id.

00:49:41
<transcript>: so this

00:49:44
<transcript>: So this is in case they just signed up.

00:49:48
<transcript>: To store that what's wrong with that object is fossil.

00:49:58
lilfreezi: u look handsome and breedable today

00:49:59
<transcript>: So we're gonna update we're gonna set the user ID. But we're also going to.

00:49:59
<transcript>: say

00:50:01
<transcript>: Say complete.

00:50:01
<transcript>: is true

00:50:03
<transcript>: Is true.

00:50:05
<transcript>: Okay.

00:50:05
<transcript>: complete

00:50:11
<transcript>: Complete is true. And what else? That's it I think. And then we're gonna say if there is a session.

00:50:16
<transcript>: Or if there is a user. Yeah. So let's just do this.

00:50:20
<transcript>: User ID equals context.

00:50:20
<transcript>: session

00:50:21
<transcript>: Session.

00:50:24
<transcript>: User ID.

00:50:27
<transcript>: And then we can just like.

00:50:27
<transcript>: delete

00:50:29
<transcript>: Delete.

00:50:39
<transcript>: That user ID complete is true. We're gonna say here.

00:50:39
<transcript>: if

00:50:40
<transcript>: If.

00:50:40
<transcript>: if

00:50:42
<transcript>: If User ID.

<transcript>: Such a Boomer or something.

00:52:07
tiredbeaver: thirsty as hell

00:52:18
<transcript>: Okay, let's let's keep going. So if there is a user ID, this can be our first up stash call.

00:52:18
<transcript>: so we're gonna

00:52:20
<transcript>: So we're gonna do a Z, add.

00:52:20
<transcript>: the add

00:52:28
lilfreezi: 0 maidens

00:52:30
<transcript>: The add to the Fash. So we're gonna use I guess we're gonna use node or IO Redis. I guess anybody have a preference on.

00:52:34
<transcript>: The Redis node, landscape.

00:52:40
okufa_f: ioredis is fine

00:52:42
<transcript>: I think I just want to use let's see, I've got a lot of these pains. I guess we're gonna create another one.

00:52:42
<transcript>: why not

00:52:44
<transcript>: Why not.

00:52:44
<transcript>: let

00:52:50
<transcript>: Let's do PMPM add IO Redis. That seems to be the first one people mention.

00:52:52
okufa_f: good client, it's what bullmq uses

00:52:54
<transcript>: All the time. I already is fine. Okay.

00:53:00
<transcript>: Good client. It's what Bowling Q uses helpless. Thanks so much for the follow.

00:53:01
<transcript>: Appreciate that.

00:53:01
<transcript>: i'll

00:53:08
<transcript>: I'll use our Redis. I don't want to spend a lot of time on this, so I'm gonna believe her. That decision. Here we go.

00:53:10
bodhihawkenmusic: ReInvent next year for me! Didn't feel like flying 21 hours back for another conference in vegas while under 21

00:53:16
<transcript>: We're gonna say import.

00:53:20
<transcript>: Io Redis import.

00:53:23
<transcript>: Redis from.

00:53:23
<transcript>: i

00:53:25
<transcript>: Io. Redis.

00:53:25
<transcript>: like that

00:53:26
<transcript>: Like that.

00:53:26
<transcript>: okay

00:53:28
<transcript>: Okay.

00:53:28
<transcript>: and then

00:53:31
<transcript>: And then we're gonna create a client. I just created a client once. Probably.

00:53:34
<transcript>: Cops, Redis, client.

00:53:34
<transcript>: equals

00:53:37
<transcript>: Equals the new Redis.

00:53:40
<transcript>: I need to capitalize that. And then we'll just say.

00:53:52
<transcript>: Like, this is just gonna be Redis, equal new Redis. Let's see. And then I paste in, so it'll be like, process.

00:54:01
<transcript>: Where is it? I thought I had type safe. I'd say things.

00:54:05
<transcript>: Let's see. I need to add it to the servers, schema or something.

00:54:08
<transcript>: No.

00:54:14
<transcript>: I added it here. Rediss. Url. Right.

00:54:16

<transcript>: Max retries per request. Is that an important distinction as well.

00:55:19
<transcript>: Register? Why is this not in my schema.

00:55:21
okufa_f: nah, its just config

00:55:24
<transcript>: What I gotta do to get that Reddit URL in there.

00:55:27
<transcript>: Got some of them in there.

00:55:35
bodhihawkenmusic: yeah live in australia, flew over to go the nightclub an bar conference (our industry)

00:55:37
<transcript>: Tz Versail no doth, and next off URL.

00:55:41
<transcript>: What am I missing? Here.

00:55:48
<transcript>: Living Australia flew over to go to the nightclub and bar conference.

00:55:57
spotmonk: have you restarted things since you added it?

00:55:57
<transcript>: Okay. So I just need to say Redis URL as string.

00:55:57
<transcript>: i thought i

00:56:02
<transcript>: I thought I thought I could like get type safety with my process that end.

00:56:14
<transcript>: I have it on the front end, just on the back end.

00:56:24
<transcript>: Is are we doing something with server end.

00:56:24
<transcript>: we're snashing

00:56:26
<transcript>: We're? Snashing it somewhere.

00:56:26
<transcript>: export

00:56:29
<transcript>: Export ends. Oh, I need to use this.

00:56:29
<transcript>: where

00:56:34
<transcript>: Where is this? Sovere. So in server. Okay, I need to import that.

00:56:37
<transcript>: Right.

00:56:39
<transcript>: Export. Comps.

00:56:39
<transcript>: end

00:56:40
<transcript>: End.

00:56:49
<transcript>: Okay. Let's see that. Am I already importing it somewhere? Probably importing it. One of these things. Yeah. Here we go.

00:56:51
<transcript>: Here we go.

00:56:57
<transcript>: So here we can say like right here import M.

00:56:57
<transcript>: and then

00:56:59
<transcript>: And then this.

00:57:02
<transcript>: Is just all confused.

00:57:02
<transcript>: it's

00:57:05
<transcript>: It's M dot. There we go.

00:57:09
<transcript>: Red as you are cool. Okay, so we have Redis.

00:57:17
<transcript>: I want to do the Max retries per request. What's that? Do? Max retries per request.

00:57:17
<transcript>: fans

00:57:23
<transcript>: Fans that don't get a replay due to the connection to the server's loss or put into a queue and it will be resent on reconnect.

00:57:23
<transcript>: and you said

00:57:24
<transcript>: And you said.

00:57:24
<transcript>: no

00:57:25
<transcript>: No.

00:57:32
<transcript>: Have you restarted things since you added it? Oh, yeah, we figured it out. Didn't we spot Monk? I just saw that message a little late.

00:57:32
<transcript>: i wanted to just

00:57:35
<transcript>: I wanted to just not do this yet.

00:57:35
<transcript>: we'll maybe look

00:57:37
<transcript>: We'll maybe look into.

00:57:43
<transcript>: Maybe looking to any config we want to add for Upstash optimization later.

00:57:43
<transcript>: const red

00:57:45
<transcript>: Const Redis equals.

00:57:45
<transcript>: new red

00:57:52
<transcript>: New Redis. Cool. So now down here I can say if user ID we're going to say something like Redis.

00:57:55
<transcript>: Zad.

00:57:56
<transcript>: The end.

00:58:03
<transcript>: What we got here a key, which is the Redis key. So we'll say scores.

00:58:06
<transcript>: And then what's next.

00:58:09
<transcript>: What's next.

00:58:15
<transcript>: Score Members Oh, Key Score Members, which is a string array.

00:58:24
<transcript>: What do I not understand about Z? Add.

00:58:24
<transcript>: z add

00:58:25
<transcript>: Z, add.

00:58:29
<transcript>: Redis. Sorted sets.

00:58:34
<transcript>: Let's see here.

00:58:40
<transcript>: Score number.

00:58:51
<transcript>: Examples ZX.

00:58:54
<transcript>: One one. Okay, so the school is first.

00:59:03
<transcript>: What is it? Game.

00:59:03
<transcript>: score

00:59:05
<transcript>: Score.

00:59:12
<transcript>: And then Game ID is what I want to do. I want to use the ID of the game as the.

00:59:12
<transcript>: key

00:59:13
<transcript>: Key.

00:59:15
<transcript>: Okay.

00:59:15
<transcript>: so we're

00:59:22
<transcript>: So we're gonna add it to that. I'm gonna add it to another. We're gonna have another one called.

00:59:27
<transcript>: Streets.

00:59:35
<transcript>: And we're gonna I guess I need to keep track I don't have right now.

00:59:39
<transcript>: The highest street for each game.

00:59:41
<transcript>: I don't want to do that.

00:59:45
<transcript>: I guess every time you.

00:59:47
<transcript>: Answer.

00:59:56
<transcript>: We could figure out if a streak just ended and we could save it to a separate table in the database, or just update.

01:00:02
<transcript>: We'll just have a single.

01:00:02
<transcript>: streak

01:00:09
<transcript>: Streak score or a streak value on game that's like highest streak for each game. So let's go to the schema.

01:00:15
<transcript>: So here we already store the current Street.

01:00:18
<transcript>: But let's store.

01:00:22
<transcript>: The largest street, right.

01:00:26
jedzo_: I dont think ive ever seen something like "session?.user?" aside from like ternary's, whats the "?" imply?

01:00:34
<transcript>: I don't want to make a long name.

01:00:34
<transcript>: trying to keep

01:00:36
<transcript>: Trying to keep it small.

01:00:52
<transcript>: First time chat. Welcome to Chat. Jedzo. I don't think I've ever seen something like session user. Aside from, like, turnaries the question Mark. Is it's like the Nolish thing, right? It's like it could be null if it is just the whole the whole assignment should just be null.

01:00:52
<transcript>: right

01:00:54
<transcript>: right so

01:00:54
<transcript>: if

01:01:00
<transcript>: If session doesn't exist if or if users doesn't exist the value let's go back to it. So here.

01:01:05
<transcript>: The user ID is going to be either.

01:01:05
<transcript>: string

01:01:07
okufa_f: Nullish coalescing operator

01:01:11
<transcript>: String run defined if session is underneath, we can safely access users.

01:01:13
<transcript>: By saying.

01:01:13
<transcript>: this by adding

01:01:21
coding_drak: optional chaining

01:01:27
jedzo_: ohhh ok, so kind of like a ternary in a way but a smarter way to kind of tell it that, hmm very cool

01:01:27
<transcript>: This by adding this question Mark operator. So we can say if session doesn't exist. Just return user ID will just be undefined. If it does, we want to access the user. It's undefined. Just return undefined. If not, we want to access ID. So it's a way to safely.

01:01:27
<transcript>: access things

01:01:31
coding_drak: nullish coalescing is ?? IIRC

01:01:32
<transcript>: Access things that could be null or undefined, I guess. Does that make sense.

01:01:34
okufa_f: pj ursj

01:01:37
okufa_f: oh yeah

01:01:39
okufa_f: that was wrong

01:01:40
<transcript>: Optional change. Thank you. Coding Drac. Welcome to Chat. Nollish Colessing Coalescing Operator. Thank you for the proper terms.

01:01:48
<transcript>: So kind of like a Turner in a way, but a smarter way to kind of tell it that. Yeah. It's just like a more terse. It's like a cleaner way to do that. Yeah.

01:01:57
<transcript>: Nolas coalescing is the double question Mark. That's correct. So that would be like if I want to say if this whole thing is null, blah.

01:01:57
<transcript>: that would be

01:01:58
wuelnerdotexe: Hola CoolCat

01:01:59
caasidev: hello

01:02:00
<transcript>: That would be Nolish cool. I think that's correct.

01:02:00
<transcript>: but

01:02:01
<transcript>: But.

01:02:05
spotmonk: background frozen again?

01:02:09
<transcript>: We figured it out quickly. I figured it out together. Optional training. Thank you so much. Welcome to Chad as well.

01:02:19
<transcript>: Oof.

01:02:24
<transcript>: Obs is choosing pain today.

01:02:27
<transcript>: Choosing violence.

01:02:27
<transcript>: all right there

01:02:29
<transcript>: All Right, there we go.

01:02:29
<transcript>: it's

01:02:33
rydeenxrising: Hello there. First time here.

01:02:36
<transcript>: It's back. Okay. Well, the did you see my example? This is the Nolasing. So I could say.

01:02:36
<transcript>: if

01:02:41
<transcript>: If the whole thing is null, use this like as a DF default value kind of.

01:02:47
<transcript>: So here we go so we've got.

01:02:50
<transcript>: We're gonna store the streak.

01:02:50
<transcript>: female

01:02:56
<transcript>: Female let's go back here. We're gonna we already store the current streak but we're gonna store.

01:02:56
<transcript>: highest

01:02:58
<transcript>: Highest streak.

01:03:00
<transcript>: Longest.

01:03:00
<transcript>: let's

01:03:03
<transcript>: Let's call it longest. We know what it means.

01:03:03
<transcript>: int

01:03:05
<transcript>: Int.

01:03:05
<transcript>: default

01:03:11
<transcript>: Default is zero so the longest street we're gonna store.

01:03:18
<transcript>: We're gonna store on the game every time we update street we're gonna also update the longest streak.

01:03:18
<transcript>: hello

01:03:21
neochromer: @adamdotdev woah who is that guy with the new hair :D

01:03:24
<transcript>: Hello, Rocking. Welcome, first time chat? Welcome to my chat.

01:03:24
<transcript>: welcome

01:03:29
<transcript>: Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, Neil chromer? Whoa, who's that guy with the new hair? Do I have new hair.

01:03:29
<transcript>: i just kind of like

01:03:31
<transcript>: I just kind of, like, pushed it up today.

01:03:31
<transcript>: do you

01:03:33
<transcript>: Do you approve.

01:03:37
okufa_f: how do you migrate

01:03:41
neochromer: oh  Ithought you had a haircut

01:03:42
neochromer: its cool

01:03:47
<transcript>: Does this look like a hair add? Like a shampoo. Add. I put it up. My wife likes it when I push it up, she says, I have a round face. She looked this up. I have a round face. So you want to make your hair Topler.

01:03:47
<transcript>: to

01:03:49
<transcript>: To accommodate.

01:03:49
neochromer: looks awfully similar to mine

01:03:57
neochromer: also a roundface guy

01:03:58
<transcript>: I believe her. And if she wants me to do it, I'll do it. She wants me to shave my head. I'll shave my head. You guys are just gonna be stuck with whatever my wife prefers.

01:04:07
<transcript>: Thought I had a haircut. I did get a haircut. Oh, I guess I got. Did I get haircut since my last stream? I guess I did. Yeah.

01:04:08
neochromer: My wife told me to get a haircut today too..

01:04:11
<transcript>: I got a nice fresh cut for reinvent.

01:04:11
<transcript>: looks

01:04:14
neochromer: Im lazy

01:04:16
<transcript>: Looks awfully similar to mine. Also around Face guys, welcome to the Round Face Guy club.

01:04:16
<transcript>: my wife

01:04:24
neochromer: I would never get a haircut..

01:04:34
<transcript>: My wife told me to get a haircut today, too. We just do what our wife's day. Thank you for the follow. Pawn. Mercher. Pawnmarcher and coating Drac. Coating Drac. Coming in with the follow the first time chat helping out being helpful. I appreciate you coding Drac. I appreciate all of you, but especially coding dressing. Drac.

01:04:34
<transcript>: jedz

01:04:39
coding_drak: <3

01:04:44
<transcript>: Jedzo. Thank you for the follow PCM. I see you. Thank you all for the follows. Thank you for the follow crunch arou. That makes me hungry. That makes me want some cereal or something.

01:04:46
<transcript>: I would never get a haircut.

01:04:46
<transcript>: sometimes

01:05:06
<transcript>: Sometimes I think about just like, it'd be so great to just have no hair. So just shave it all off and never have to think about my hair again. I hate having to, like, fix my hair or do things with my hair. I just hate it. Okay. So we're gonna have longest streak. Now. Every time we update this Street, let's see here.

01:05:09
<transcript>: Here.

01:05:09
<transcript>: we're gonna say

01:05:12
<transcript>: We're gonna say I guess I need to do I need to do this right.

01:05:22
<transcript>: Let's just do another VSplit. And let's say NPX Prisma DB push. We got to add that longest variable.

01:05:29
<transcript>: Or table column. I don't even know anything about databases anymore. Npx. Prisma generates.

01:05:39
<transcript>: The reason I don't know anything about databases is I typically use DynamoDB. It's different.

01:05:39
<transcript>: it's not

01:05:42
<transcript>: It's not a SQL based database.

01:05:47
<transcript>: It's a node sequel database, if you will, I just hate that term. I really hate it.

01:05:48
<transcript>: Because.

01:05:48
<transcript>: it's not

01:05:57
<transcript>: It's not. There's nothing wrong with that term. It's accurate. No sequel. There is no sequel. It's just there's a lot of baggage with that term. Because of MongoDB. Like eight years ago.

01:05:57
<transcript>: it's a lot of baggage

01:05:58
okufa_f: npx prisma migrate dev will do the db push + generate in one go

01:06:00
<transcript>: It's a lot of baggage Mongo kind of screwed the hole no sequel thing.

01:06:00
<transcript>: they're

01:06:02
<transcript>: They're better now, but.

01:06:02
<transcript>: doesn't

01:06:10
estrangedhd: I hate databases that don't have relations

01:06:13
<transcript>: Doesn't erase all of the bad feelings around that term. What am I doing right now? Oh, yeah, streak. So here's our streak. And what we want to do is say.

01:06:16
<transcript>: The Max of.

01:06:16
<transcript>: so we're gonna

01:06:16
bodhihawkenmusic: hahaha, i had to start working sql this year (after growing up using only noSQL) was a hell of a ride!

01:06:18
<transcript>: So we're gonna say.

01:06:18
<transcript>: top

01:06:19
<transcript>: Top.

01:06:19
<transcript>: longest

01:06:20
<transcript>: Longest.

01:06:20
<transcript>: equals

01:06:26
<transcript>: Equals Mass Max streak and round game streak.

01:06:32
<transcript>: That always gonna keep the big one when that goes to zero.

01:06:35
<transcript>: The previous streak will stay.

01:06:36
<transcript>: No, no.

01:06:39
<transcript>: Cuz we got to think about longest.

01:06:50
<transcript>: So Matt round game longest. So the this will keep it. It'll never go lower than its current value. Right? So we'll keep upping it.

01:06:50
<transcript>: as the street

01:06:52
<transcript>: As the street grows.

01:06:52
<transcript>: but it'll

01:06:59
<transcript>: But it'll never go down? That's what we want? So then when I do my game update, I need to say, longest.

01:07:03
<transcript>: longestart

01:07:03
<transcript>: longestart is

01:07:05
<transcript>: Longestart? Is it just that.

01:07:16
<transcript>: Mbx Prisma migrate Dev will do the DB push plus generate and one go. Thank you so much. A Kufa I did not know this. Mpx print.

01:07:19
<transcript>: Dev? What is Dev? Stand for.

01:07:19
<transcript>: is that supposed to be

01:07:24
<transcript>: Is that supposed to be the branch name or migrate Dev.

01:07:29
<transcript>: A string hates databases that don't have relations.

01:07:33
<transcript>: I mean, I build a lot of stuff in DynamoDB. They're still relations.

01:07:39
<transcript>: I just don't use SQL to interact with my database, but it's still relational.

01:07:39
<transcript>: you don't

01:07:43
<transcript>: You don't have like foreign keys you don't do join.

01:07:47
<transcript>: You structure your data in such a way that.

01:07:47
<transcript>: you can

01:07:49
<transcript>: You can get some of the same effects.

01:07:49
<transcript>: just in a

01:07:58
<transcript>: Just in a predictably performant way so they're all there's tradeoffs on everything there's no silver bullet? But I do love DynamoDB? I had to start working.

01:07:58
<transcript>: sequel this year

01:08:03
<transcript>: Sequel this year after growing up using only no sequel. Hell of a Ride. Yeah, it's a it's an experience.

01:08:09
<transcript>: An experience going back to Sequel because I started my career with SQL Databases and.

01:08:09
<transcript>: certainly there's the

01:08:17
<transcript>: Certainly there's the norm in our industry. But after like five years of only doing stuff with Dynamo, it's really weird to come back to sequel.

01:08:23
<transcript>: Okay. So now we got this longest that we can now add our longest streak. Here.

01:08:32
<transcript>: Like right here. Streak. Right. Okay. So we sort of the longest or the streak for the game, and we store the score in our.

01:08:32
<transcript>: redis

01:08:33
daglee: I wrote my DB, it ended up being really fast and 100% dataloss.

01:08:35
<transcript>: Redis database. I guess. Are these.

01:08:36
<transcript>: Are the.

01:08:36
<transcript>: promises

01:08:41
<transcript>: Promises, I'm guessing yes. So await.

01:08:41
<transcript>: we'll do

01:08:43
<transcript>: We'll do like a let's do this.

01:08:45
<transcript>: Weight promise.

01:08:45
<transcript>: all

01:08:47
<transcript>: All.

01:08:58
<transcript>: Can I not do that.

01:09:00
okufa_f: music really helps a hectic night

01:09:06
<transcript>: Cool. So we're gonna store both of those in Redis. I already have to pee. This is early.

01:09:06
<transcript>: this is

01:09:13
<transcript>: This is early for me to have to pee. I wrote my DB. It ended up being really fast and 100% data loss.

01:09:17
<transcript>: 100% data loss sounds bad daglie.

01:09:17
<transcript>: music

01:09:25
<transcript>: Music really helps a hectic man, I'm glad a poofa. I'm afraid you're going to listen to my scene music now as I take a break to Pee Bear back.

<transcript>: Vo's code has better Astros before it does. Lil Freeze I mean, I haven't actually used Vs. Code, but I know Astro supports not great any of them.

01:20:02
<transcript>: i haven't

01:20:06
<transcript>: I haven't figured out how to get go to definition working which is a bummer.

01:20:08
<transcript>: I.

01:20:10
<transcript>: Mostly working, I guess.

01:20:10
<transcript>: but

01:20:15
<transcript>: But. Oh, you didn't do anything capitalist. Well, just keeping you just keeping you.

01:20:15
<transcript>: doing great

01:20:15
cowfacedude99: I have modtools turned off

01:20:19
<transcript>: Doing great. I thought I thought you banned the message or something.

01:20:22
daglee: Astro?

01:20:28
<transcript>: I don't I don't know what modules are.

01:20:34
<transcript>: Naggly, are you familiar with Astro.

01:20:36
cowfacedude99: too distracting

01:20:38
<transcript>: Astro build.

01:20:40
<transcript>: It's awesome.

01:20:45
<transcript>: It's like PHP. In JavaScript, though.

01:20:47
daglee: Nope

01:20:48
wuelnerdotexe: @lilfreezi fun fact: I wrote the plugin for Astro support into Vim...

01:20:49
<transcript>: And you choose like a front end framework.

01:20:49
<transcript>: when you opt

01:20:51
cowfacedude99: astro is really cool

01:20:52
<transcript>: When you opt into JavaScript, pretty great.

01:20:59
<transcript>: Whoa. You wrote the plugin for Astro support into them.

01:20:59
<transcript>: what

01:21:00
<transcript>: What.

01:21:03
daglee: Ah, not a webdev. :)

01:21:05
<transcript>: Are you serious.

01:21:11
<transcript>: That's awesome. Oh, you're not a web Dev. Now that's probably doesn't make any sense, does it? Ugly.

01:21:14
<transcript>: You rub the link.

01:21:14
<transcript>: would you write

01:21:16
<transcript>: Would you write Wellner.

01:21:17
lilfreezi: @WuelnerDotEXE sweet

01:21:19
wuelnerdotexe: And the LSP for vim-lsp-settings, too \0/

01:21:23
<transcript>: I feel like based on that sentence, you could help me figure out how to get go to definition working.

01:21:27
<transcript>: In the LSP or VM LSP settings, too? What.

01:21:33
<transcript>: Wellner, are you on the Astro team or just an enthusiast.

01:21:38
<transcript>: All right, let's see.

01:21:38
<transcript>: so

01:21:41
<transcript>: So we're adding these to Redis.

01:21:44
cowfacedude99: astro.vim I guess

01:21:45
<transcript>: The scores and the streaks.

01:21:50
<transcript>: So we got two sets. And this Redis database.

01:21:50
<transcript>: next

01:21:52
<transcript>: Next next thing we're going to do.

01:21:52
<transcript>: is

01:21:53
<transcript>: Is.

01:21:53
<transcript>: we've

01:21:55
<transcript>: We've updated.

01:22:00
<transcript>: I guess all these promises could be batched.

01:22:00
<transcript>: no because this one

01:22:02
wuelnerdotexe: Nou, I'm a community member haha

01:22:02
<transcript>: No. Because this one is only if there's a user ID.

01:22:09
cowfacedude99: @WuelnerDotEXE ?

01:22:11
<transcript>: Whereas we want to do this one every time.

01:22:12
wuelnerdotexe: @lilfreezi thanks \0/

01:22:14
<transcript>: I can still do something like this.

01:22:14
deadrobotdev: Hey Adam and chat! rumpWave Is the watch dot dev Discord still happening?

01:22:26
<transcript>: My username result for anything. No.

01:22:26
<transcript>: right

01:22:28
<transcript>: Right.

01:22:32
<transcript>: Promise is Whoa.

01:22:32
<transcript>: i've had some

01:22:34
<transcript>: I've had some weird.

01:22:42
<transcript>: That wasn't probably a bug, that was probably just me being dumb and not being an insert mode. Promises that push.

01:22:44
<transcript>: And then.

01:22:53
<transcript>: You push an array into an array.

01:22:53
<transcript>: does that work the way

01:22:56
<transcript>: Does that work the way I think it works that add both of them.

01:23:02
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:23:04
<transcript>: And add any numbers.

01:23:06
<transcript>: I don't even have to have that.

01:23:08
<transcript>: Okay. So we're pushing this.

01:23:08
<transcript>: to and

01:23:11
<transcript>: To and then down here we're gonna say.

01:23:15
jedzo_: i would imagine, make it a matrix lol

01:23:18
<transcript>: Aim.

01:23:21
<transcript>: For Street.

01:23:24
<transcript>: Promise.

01:23:26
<transcript>: Await.

01:23:26
<transcript>: promise

01:23:27
<transcript>: Promise.

01:23:27
<transcript>: all

01:23:28
<transcript>: All.

01:23:30
<transcript>: Promises.

01:23:33
<transcript>: What's wrong with that.

01:23:36
<transcript>: Oh, there's already a game.

01:23:39
<transcript>: I don't need the updated game, right.

01:23:39
<transcript>: okay

01:23:42
<transcript>: Okay, scores, streaks.

01:23:42
<transcript>: like what

01:23:46
<transcript>: Like what are these number game or undefined.

01:23:49
<transcript>: I.

01:23:49
<transcript>: doesn't know

01:23:50
<transcript>: Doesn't know.

01:23:50
<transcript>: i don't

01:23:52
<transcript>: I don't need any of these.

01:23:55
<transcript>: Do I need any of the responses.

01:23:58
<transcript>: Dead robot? What's going on.

01:23:58
<transcript>: is

01:24:05
<transcript>: Is the watch Dev discourse still happening? You know, did robot. I kind of fell. I fell out of that effort. I just. I.

01:24:05
<transcript>: have a logo

01:24:06
<transcript>: Have a logo.

01:24:06
<transcript>: i have

01:24:08
<transcript>: I have.

01:24:21
wuelnerdotexe: @cowfacedude99 🙃

01:24:21
<transcript>: This cord. I just haven't. Yeah, I just didn't do it. I just started. Somebody raised the point. I think Binja raised the point that we wouldn't be able to do the, like, Linked, Twitter to Discord thing.

01:24:25
<transcript>: Because there'd be so many streamers in one discord.

01:24:25
<transcript>: i

01:24:31
<transcript>: I still conceptually like the idea, but I don't know if that's important to people like having subchannels and stuff. You wouldn't be able to do that.

01:24:34
<transcript>: Unless we built something custom, I guess.

01:24:34
<transcript>: so

01:24:40
<transcript>: So it's just kind of like shelf, like a lot of things that I think I want to do. Just shelf for a while. Maybe I'll come back to it.

01:24:49
<transcript>: Community member. Well, that's awesome. That you wrote all that stuff. Well, there.

01:24:52
<transcript>: Would matter make it a matrix.

01:24:52
<transcript>: a mat

01:24:54
<transcript>: A Matrix.

01:24:54
<transcript>: what

01:24:55
<transcript>: What.

01:24:56
estrangedhd: you already bought the watch.dev domain? Kappa

01:24:58
<transcript>: Like these should be I'm gonna just do this.

01:25:03
<transcript>: Okay, so we're awaiting those promises. We're ignoring the results.

01:25:08
<transcript>: We're assuming everything goes well because everything always goes well with computers, right.

01:25:12
<transcript>: Next thing we're gonna do is.

01:25:21
<transcript>: Okay. So we've added if there is a user ID, we've added the score and the streaks to our Redis database.

01:25:24
<transcript>: Next thing we can do.

01:25:24
<transcript>: we want

01:25:29
<transcript>: We want to get. So what is the response to this? Finalized. I want to return.

01:25:29
<transcript>: like a

01:25:33
<transcript>: Like a relative score. Like your relative leaderboard position.

01:25:40
<transcript>: And maybe like I don't know if I want to also return the first handful of scores, you can know what the top score is.

01:25:50
<transcript>: So we might do that.

01:25:50
<transcript>: i did already

01:25:54
<transcript>: I did already buy the Watch Dev domain. That's right, we're strange.

01:25:54
deadrobotdev: Got ya. Yeah, I really liked the idea of joining one community as opposed to 20 different streamer Discords.

01:26:04
<transcript>: Yeah, I still really like the idea high level if we can work out the details.

01:26:07
<transcript>: I'm gonna start shuffling.

01:26:09
<transcript>: Music.

01:26:15
<transcript>: So.

01:26:15
<transcript>: to get

01:26:16
<transcript>: To get the.

01:26:21
<transcript>: Oh, no. Query procedure on Pet. Yeah, I need updates up front end.

01:26:29
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow ridina or writing.

01:26:33
<transcript>: So it's really it'd be easy to just get the top ten scores.

01:26:33
<transcript>: we just

01:26:36
<transcript>: We just put an index on our sequel database for that.

01:26:36
<transcript>: right

01:26:37
<transcript>: Right.

01:26:44
<transcript>: But if I wanted to get.

01:26:48
wuelnerdotexe: What happened with your go-to-definition ?? 🤔

01:26:59
<transcript>: If I want to get the.

01:27:03
<transcript>: Owning the surrounding.

01:27:03
<transcript>: scores

01:27:06
<transcript>: Scores on a leaderboard so like.

01:27:06
<transcript>: yours

01:27:08
<transcript>: Yours and then any above and below it.

01:27:08
<transcript>: right

01:27:10
<transcript>: Right.

01:27:10
<transcript>: so

01:27:11
<transcript>: So I'm gonna do.

01:27:11
<transcript>: a

01:27:12
<transcript>: A.

01:27:20
<transcript>: Thing.

01:27:20
<transcript>: leader

01:27:26
<transcript>: Leaderboard would be something like a Weight Redis Z.

01:27:29
<transcript>: Rev. Rank.

01:27:34
<transcript>: So that would get the rank of yours.

01:27:40
<transcript>: Return a range of members in a sorted set by index order from high to low.

01:27:56
<transcript>: How would I get the ones around it? How would I want to do that.

01:28:08
cowfacedude99: @DeadRobotDev I think the vimconf discord has a few streamer notifications.

01:28:27
cowfacedude99: neovimconf*

01:28:59
<transcript>: Key. Start and stop.

01:29:12
<transcript>: And style are zero based indexes.

01:29:12
<transcript>: what do we do

01:29:17
<transcript>: What do we do for ties on ties? You just sort them by time.

01:29:17
<transcript>: what's best

01:29:19
<transcript>: What's best.

01:29:43
cowfacedude99: and isn't there a feature to follow notifications on discord?

01:29:46
<transcript>: So I can get the I guess I can do this to get.

01:29:48
<transcript>: Following like if I chose.

01:29:53
<transcript>: Start at the score of your score and get.

01:29:57
<transcript>: Three elements, and then revert and then do the.

01:29:57
<transcript>: revers

01:30:00
<transcript>: Reverse range to get the other three right.

01:30:07
<transcript>: What happened to your go to definition? I don't know, Wilner. It just doesn't work.

01:30:10
<transcript>: I can't go to definition in my astrophiles.

01:30:16
<transcript>: I think the VM Core Vimcomp Discord has a few stream notifications.

01:30:16
<transcript>: and isn't

01:30:16
deadrobotdev: @cowfacedude99 Thanks, but it's not really about the notifications. It's more that I struggle to be active on Discord in general, and would rather focus that energy on a few central servers than 20 different streamer Discords.

01:30:18
<transcript>: And Isn't there a feature to follow notifications on discord.

01:30:18
<transcript>: i'll be honest

01:30:20
<transcript>: I'll be honest. I haven't looked into it too much.

01:30:20
<transcript>: bin

01:30:26
<transcript>: Binge is just raised that concern, and I was kind of like I have a lot of other things going on, so just kind of shelf the idea.

01:30:39
<transcript>: Yeah, agreed. Dead robot. Like I I'm in too many things, too many slack workspaces to me. Discord servers. I can't keep up. And I would just love to have, like, one place where.

01:30:39
<transcript>: everyone

01:30:43
<transcript>: Everyone I hung out with was in the same place.

01:30:48
dedadev: hi adam

01:30:53
<transcript>: Okay. So I think Z range is the best way.

01:30:57
<transcript>: What is this.

01:31:14
<transcript>: Z Range by score.

01:31:19
cowfacedude99: oh. I live on one or two discord servers. and that too one or two channels. so it is not much of an issue for me

01:31:25
<transcript>: Oh, in the Z range I have to say Min and Max I do.

01:31:31
<transcript>: So here.

01:31:31
<transcript>: z range

01:31:33
<transcript>: Z range.

01:31:33
<transcript>: negative

01:31:35
<transcript>: Negative two is negative one.

01:31:38
<transcript>: What's that do.

01:31:42
daglee: I have 8 servers where people I know hang out! Lets unify it and create on place for all of them! We now have 9 servers.

01:31:45
<transcript>: What is the negative numbers? Do.

01:31:45
<transcript>: let's see

01:31:46
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:31:46
<transcript>: negative

01:31:47
<transcript>: Negative.

01:31:52
<transcript>: Numbers in the games offsets from the end of the sorted set.

01:31:55
<transcript>: Okay.

01:31:58
deadrobotdev: @daglee LUL

01:31:58
<transcript>: So if I get the index.

01:32:05
<transcript>: I did a Div.

01:32:05
<transcript>: what's going on

01:32:06
<transcript>: What's going on.

01:32:12
<transcript>: Let's goin on.

01:32:12
<transcript>: how do i want to do this

01:32:14
<transcript>: How do I want to do this.

01:32:17
<transcript>: Let's see, I want.

01:32:23
<transcript>: I won. Here's what I want. Returned.

01:32:26
<transcript>: I want.

01:32:30
wuelnerdotexe: @daglee jaja

01:32:31
<transcript>: Something like.

01:32:35
<transcript>: A low light game.

01:32:39
<transcript>: And.

01:32:42
cowfacedude99: @daglee the classic let's fix bugs

01:32:44
dedadev: I'm trying to figure out what is the use case of Lambda

01:32:51
<transcript>: Oh, I guess no, I don't need store the rank in the relational data in the sequel database, but I want to return like rank, which might be like.

01:32:53
<transcript>: 35.

01:32:53
<transcript>: but then i'm

01:32:55
<transcript>: But then I'm going to return.

01:32:55
<transcript>: the

01:32:57
<transcript>: The results.

01:32:59
<transcript>: Around.

01:32:59
<transcript>: your

01:33:01
<transcript>: Your score.

01:33:01
<transcript>: i want to display

01:33:11
<transcript>: I want to display, like, the high scores around yours. I thought about, yeah, I thought about doing, like, Do I want to show, like, the top five, too? Just so you know, like, what is it? Or maybe just the top score.

01:33:12
deverik1: background frozen I think

01:33:17
<transcript>: Okay. Let's just let's just start with your rank. Let's immediately.

01:33:20
<transcript>: Just stop thinking.

01:33:21
bodhihawkenmusic: @dedadev everything!

01:33:23
<transcript>: I'm thinking too much.

01:33:33
<transcript>: Not doing enough. Let's just get your current rank. Your current rank would be constrank. Equals. Await. Redis.

01:33:33
<transcript>: z

01:33:36
<transcript>: Zrank at zrevrank.

01:33:41
<transcript>: And it's gonna be the key.

01:33:42
<transcript>: Of course.

01:33:44
cowfacedude99: your desktop input is frozen @adamdotdev

01:33:47
<transcript>: And then it's going to be the member.

01:33:47
<transcript>: which is

01:33:51
<transcript>: Which is just the string that we use. Let's just game ID. Right.

01:33:57
<transcript>: And what is the value of rank.

01:33:57
<transcript>: number

01:34:01
<transcript>: Number or null. Okay, so then let's just return.

01:34:03
<transcript>: Return.

01:34:05
<transcript>: I am going to.

01:34:05
wuelnerdotexe: Yep

01:34:07
<transcript>: Const.

01:34:08
<transcript>: construct

01:34:09
<transcript>: Construct.

01:34:14
<transcript>: I'm going to return the updated game.

01:34:16
<transcript>: Turn.

01:34:22
<transcript>: Updated game.

01:34:26
<transcript>: I don't know why I'm returning that so much as.

01:34:30
<transcript>: Only created from object types. What is this.

01:34:32
<transcript>: Oh, it doesn't know what it is.

01:34:38
<transcript>: I know I don't need the updated game, do I.

01:34:38
<transcript>: don't need it

01:34:40
<transcript>: Don't need it.

01:34:42
okufa_f: washu business school

01:34:47
<transcript>: So we're just going to return the rank.

01:34:55
<transcript>: The rank. The rank. I think that's it. Okay. Let's just try this.

01:34:58
<transcript>: Vector index.

01:34:58
okufa_f: any chance you'll take state of js survey this stream

01:35:00
<transcript>: Let's go.

01:35:07
<transcript>: My desktop. Empod is input is frozen again. This is Gonna gilliamoy.

01:35:11
<transcript>: It's already really annoying.

01:35:11
<transcript>: all right

01:35:12
<transcript>: All right.

01:35:12
<transcript>: obs

01:35:13
<transcript>: Obs.

01:35:13
<transcript>: ha

01:35:15
<transcript>: Hates me today.

01:35:19
<transcript>: So score, and then we're gonna show the rank.

01:35:19
<transcript>: i'll just do it

01:35:21
<transcript>: I'll just do it like this.

01:35:25
<transcript>: We gotta start figuring out styling for all this.

01:35:33
<transcript>: Oh, I've got to actually run the mutation. Let's see, I want to do that.

01:35:36
<transcript>: In the state machine when we transition.

01:35:40
<transcript>: So delete this thing.

01:35:43
lucemans: heya!

01:35:44
<transcript>: Okay.

01:35:49
<transcript>: Let's see here. Next. No transition.

01:35:49
<transcript>: from

01:35:50
<transcript>: From.

01:35:51
cowfacedude99: @okufa_f it was interesting for me at least

01:35:56
<transcript>: Here. So game over on game over. We're going to.

01:35:58
<transcript>: Invoke a service.

01:36:00
okufa_f: it was lol

01:36:05
<transcript>: Finalize.

01:36:14
<transcript>: On done.

01:36:24
<transcript>: This best. Do I want to invoke a service, or do I just want to call an action? We could just call an action. Maybe.

01:36:28
<transcript>: Now because we're gonna actually update the context with the results, right.

01:36:30
<transcript>: So undone.

01:36:36
<transcript>: Target. Is there's no target? But there is an actions.

01:36:39
<transcript>: Sign.

01:36:50
<transcript>: I guess we're gonna add a rank.

01:36:55
<transcript>: Yes, I guess.

01:36:59
<transcript>: What did I do wrong here assign.

01:37:02
<transcript>: Actions.

01:37:05
<transcript>: Make that an array.

01:37:07
<transcript>: Oh, just like this.

01:37:11
<transcript>: Contacts event.

01:37:11
<transcript>: what do i

01:37:16
<transcript>: What do I do wrong here? Oh, it's just because I'm using a thing that doesn't exist on context.

01:37:16
<transcript>: so here

01:37:17
<transcript>: So here.

01:37:20
<transcript>: Rank is a number.

01:37:22
<transcript>: Okay.

01:37:25
<transcript>: Doesn't like it? What's wrong.

01:37:26
cowfacedude99: living on twitch and yt half of the time actually meant that I knew some of the stuff that was going around. the bundler and some other stuff tripped me up though

01:37:29
<transcript>: Void is not a sound with that personal action. What.

01:37:34
<transcript>: Okay, let's just do this. I should have just done this from the beginning.

01:37:41
<transcript>: Here.

01:37:47
<transcript>: Finalize.

01:37:54
<transcript>: Okay.

01:37:54
<transcript>: assign

01:37:56
<transcript>: Assign.

01:37:56
<transcript>: that's

01:37:57
<transcript>: That's gonna be.

01:38:01
<transcript>: Rank. Oh, I see what I did. I didn't return it.

01:38:06
<transcript>: Okay.

01:38:20
<transcript>: Target. There's no target. It's not going to transition. It's just gonna do this finalization. Every time we go to game over, okay.

01:38:28
<transcript>: Sorry I've been neglecting chat. Welcome to Chat, Lucy, man's. Hey, what's going on? Welcome to my chat.

01:38:36
<transcript>: Of JS survey. This on the stream. Hey, that's a good idea. Yeah, we'll do that.

01:38:39
<transcript>: It's not on this stream today. Probably.

01:38:39
<transcript>: or is the wins

01:38:41
<transcript>: Or is the wins the deadline.

01:38:55
<transcript>: Finalize on done actions.

01:38:55
<transcript>: okay

01:38:59
<transcript>: Okay, so we need to create our finalized service.

01:39:03
<transcript>: Here.

01:39:06
<transcript>: I finalize.

01:39:15
<transcript>: Okay return new promise async.

01:39:15
<transcript>: resolve

01:39:16
<transcript>: Resolve.

01:39:20
<transcript>: And do it. Okay.

01:39:21
okufa_f: The survey will run until December 15, 2022, and the survey results will be released shortly afterwards.

01:39:27
<transcript>: Either create this mutation up here. Yeah. So.

01:39:27
<transcript>: final

01:39:30
<transcript>: Finalized mutation equals.

01:39:30
<transcript>: tr

01:39:33
<transcript>: Trpc that use means mutation.

01:39:35
<transcript>: Name.

01:39:40
<transcript>: Okay.

01:39:44
<transcript>: We'll say.

01:39:47
<transcript>: Here.

01:39:51
<transcript>: Finalize equals.

01:39:53
<transcript>: Permutation output.

01:39:53
<transcript>: game

01:39:55
<transcript>: Game finalized.

01:39:57
<transcript>: Okay.

01:40:01
<transcript>: So here.

01:40:05
<transcript>: What.

01:40:10
<transcript>: Oh, how did I get back here? I didn't mean to get back here.

01:40:16
<transcript>: We go Nope.

01:40:16
<transcript>: here

01:40:22
<transcript>: Here we go. Here. Finalizement. Okay. Finalized. So here we're gonna do.

01:40:31
<transcript>: Finalize mutation. Mutate async.

01:40:35
<transcript>: And we got a pass.

01:40:35
<transcript>: a game id

01:40:36
<transcript>: A Game ID.

01:40:40
<transcript>: The Context game.

01:40:42
<transcript>: Id.

01:40:46
<transcript>: If there's no game, I guess.

01:40:55
<transcript>: There's no.

01:40:57
<transcript>: Game.

01:40:57
<transcript>: above

01:41:03
<transcript>: Above on the find. I guess that's fine. We'll come back. That what would be the state where you get into the I don't know.

01:41:05
<transcript>: Okay.

01:41:05
<transcript>: wait

01:41:06
<transcript>: Wait.

01:41:11
<transcript>: And I guess I just need to return, not just need to return this, right.

01:41:16
<transcript>: You say they think that'll return the promise.

01:41:19
<transcript>: Oh no no? I.

01:41:28
<transcript>: 'm finalized equals await.

01:41:31
<transcript>: And then we say.

01:41:31
<transcript>: resolve

01:41:33
<transcript>: Resolve? Finalized.

01:41:39
<transcript>: Rank.

01:41:41
<transcript>: Resolve.

01:41:43
<transcript>: About rank.

01:41:52
<transcript>: Just kind of like, I don't know. I'm just trying to, like, involve up stash. We're just still threading it. We're just trying to get this thing doing something into end.

01:41:57
<transcript>: So that's resolved. Okay.

01:41:57
<transcript>: so finalize now

01:42:01
<transcript>: So finalize now should grab the rank and put it on the context.

01:42:04
<transcript>: And then down here.

01:42:08
<transcript>: We can display it.

01:42:10
<transcript>: Context.

01:42:13
<transcript>: Rank.

01:42:18
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:42:21
<transcript>: Right, let's try it.

01:42:25
<transcript>: So let's play a new game.

01:42:34
<transcript>: And we should be the first rank on this first one, right? Because there's nobody else.

01:42:34
<transcript>: what is this

01:42:36
<transcript>: What is this one.

01:42:38
<transcript>: Oh, Geez.

01:42:38
<transcript>: devops gr

01:42:40
<transcript>: Devops grew? I don't know. Oh.

01:42:42
<transcript>: What happens.

01:42:42
<transcript>: long

01:42:46
<transcript>: Longest is NAN. That's no good.

01:42:49
<transcript>: Did you mean rounds? Okay.

01:42:49
<transcript>: let's let's go

01:42:51
<transcript>: Let's let's go back here.

01:43:02
<transcript>: Game router. How did that end up being NAN? So longest is Matthot Max streak which could be.

01:43:02
<transcript>: zero

01:43:04
<transcript>: Zero or any number greater.

01:43:07
<transcript>: Than zero.

01:43:10
<transcript>: Longest.

01:43:14
<transcript>: Game that longest could be undefined. So is Matt Max.

01:43:18
<transcript>: If you pass.

01:43:23
<transcript>: Undefined in math. Max? Is it returned? Nan? That's a bummer.

01:43:24
okufa_f: how do you deal with your errors in your frontend where you have that toast at the bottom

01:43:26
<transcript>: So we just need to say.

01:43:28
<transcript>: No less.

01:43:32
<transcript>: Noellesh. Nolish. Coalescing.

01:43:34
<transcript>: That's hard to say.

01:43:40
<transcript>: No, nolishing.

01:43:40
<transcript>: but we learned nerds

01:43:47
<transcript>: But we learned nerds earlier. We need to just default longest to zero. Okay, I think that's gonna fix it.

01:43:53
<transcript>: I think I think that'll fix it. Let's just repress this.

01:43:57
<transcript>: Now what happened? Longest one.

01:43:57
<transcript>: prism

01:44:01
<transcript>: Prism A game update? Unknown. Arg longest.

01:44:01
<transcript>: what

01:44:08
<transcript>: What do you mean? You should know about longest we updated things, didn't we? Or maybe I need to restart, though.

01:44:11
<transcript>: Let's restart it.

01:44:21
<transcript>: Okay, let's. Yeah, games. Zero. Okay. Score zero. Play. Game.

01:44:24
<transcript>: I'm gonna have to sign in, though.

01:44:26
<transcript>: If I'm not signed in.

01:44:31
<transcript>: Let's figure that out.

01:44:31
<transcript>: clock control

01:44:33
<transcript>: Clock control. Api. What is this.

01:44:36
<transcript>: I don't know, I got it.

01:44:39
<transcript>: Secrets manager.

01:44:48
<transcript>: Okay. I'm just gonna get a few points here and then let it expire.

01:44:53
<transcript>: I'm just too good at this game. Now, this game that I created.

01:44:58
<transcript>: How do you deal with your errors in your front end, we have that toast at the bottom.

01:45:06
<transcript>: That's just built into next JS, isn't it that little air thing that pops up on the bottom? I think that's just built into.

01:45:06
<transcript>: next

01:45:08
<transcript>: Next JS.

01:45:08
<transcript>: so everywhere

01:45:15
<transcript>: So everywhere run until December 15, and the survey results will be released shortly after. Yeah, we'll do it on another stream in the future.

01:45:15
<transcript>: so i need

01:45:18
<transcript>: So I need to sign in with Twitter because it's not gonna work.

01:45:18
<transcript>: if there's not

01:45:20
<transcript>: If there's not a session.

01:45:20
<transcript>: but

01:45:31
<transcript>: But now I can play so we got we gotta work on that flow. Like, once you've signed into Twitter, it should rerun to get your current rank or just take it to the leaderboard or something.

01:45:35
<transcript>: As Nitro Enclaves. Let's just get a new score here.

01:45:39
<transcript>: I am.

01:45:49
<transcript>: We're gonna get some kind of a score, and then, yeah, I'm getting too good at this. I do see a lot of repeats. I wonder if there's something wrong with my randomizations.

01:45:54
<transcript>: Every once in a while I'll see a new one but I've never seen.

01:46:00
<transcript>: Okay. I should probably let it.

01:46:00
<transcript>: let it go

01:46:02
<transcript>: Let it go down some.

01:46:07
<transcript>: But when you're so easy I just want to just want to answer them.

01:46:13
<transcript>: Still haven't missed have I.

01:46:21
<transcript>: Know that.

01:46:21
<transcript>: have i

01:46:23
<transcript>: Have I just done this? Enough.

01:46:23
<transcript>: but i

01:46:25
<transcript>: But I know them.

01:46:31
<transcript>: Anybody can you tell me if this is easy for the.

01:46:31
<transcript>: i don't know what this one

01:46:33
<transcript>: I don't know what this one is. Actually probably that.

01:46:38
<transcript>: Secrets Manager, we just got that one.

01:46:43
<transcript>: Cognito.

01:46:45
fitzsimons_dev: I'm 0 for the whole time pretty much

01:46:50
<transcript>: I kind of want to keep my street going.

01:46:54
<transcript>: Well, I do need to let some time drift off. I actually don't know this one.

01:46:54
<transcript>: and it could be

01:46:55
okufa_f: it's intuitive, but i wouldn't say i know everything 100%

01:46:56
bodhihawkenmusic: im guessing about 7/10 so far

01:46:56
<transcript>: And it could be a few things.

01:46:56
<transcript>: probably

01:46:57
zirus16: is normal difficulty

01:46:58
<transcript>: Probably data sync.

01:47:02
<transcript>: You've guessed seven ads in so far.

01:47:07
<transcript>: Fits them in a zero for the whole time. Pretty much. Let's try data sync.

01:47:07
<transcript>: got it

01:47:09
<transcript>: Got it.

01:47:12
<transcript>: This one's gonna be easy, it's laugh.

01:47:16
<transcript>: There's a lot of like clues.

01:47:16
<transcript>: so

01:47:23
<transcript>: So this type of a service it is and the color of the background give you a clue. Is that fraud detector? What is this one? Actually don't know.

01:47:23
<transcript>: oh

01:47:25
<transcript>: Oh.

01:47:25
<transcript>: missed it okay

01:47:26
<transcript>: Missed it. Okay.

01:47:26
<transcript>: rank zero

01:47:33
<transcript>: Rank zero, which is actually the first. So that's actually correct. So that's we gotta add one to the range.

01:47:33
<transcript>: because we don't want to

01:47:37
<transcript>: Because we don't want to be zero based. Let's go back here.

01:47:40
<transcript>: Rank.

01:47:45
<transcript>: Rank is ranked plus one.

01:47:53
<transcript>: Possibly. No. Is it.

01:47:56
<transcript>: Possible.

01:47:56
kj11053: Hi chat what editor is this?

01:47:59
<transcript>: Rank.

01:48:06
<transcript>: If it's no.

01:48:09
daglee: neovim

01:48:09
<transcript>: Let's just do this.

01:48:10
zirus16: you need to put a check icon instead that emoji, it doesnt go with the UI you use. the game looks fun.

01:48:12
<transcript>: For rank.

01:48:14
<transcript>: Result.

01:48:14
<transcript>: and then let's

01:48:17
<transcript>: And then let's say constrank.

01:48:17
kj11053: @daglee thank

01:48:20
<transcript>: Equals rank result.

01:48:24
<transcript>: results

01:48:25
<transcript>: Results.

01:48:25
<transcript>: defin

01:48:28
<transcript>: Defined or no.

01:48:30
<transcript>: I guess it's just stick with no, I don't know.

01:48:35
<transcript>: Oh.

01:48:38
<transcript>: Okay.

01:48:38
<transcript>: how about that

01:48:40
<transcript>: How about that.

01:48:44
<transcript>: About that. Let's try it again.

01:48:44
<transcript>: that should

01:48:46
<transcript>: That should be one based.

01:48:53
<transcript>: Welcome to Check KJ. It is Neil. Them is Normal difficulty.

01:48:53
<transcript>: yeah we don't

01:48:58
<transcript>: Yeah, we don't have. I could. We could do different levels of difficulty. Thank you for the follow. S. Three. One, one.

01:49:06
<transcript>: Need to put a check icon instead of that. Emoji doesn't go with UIU's. Yeah, good call zoris. I actually had the same thought.

01:49:08
<transcript>: All those scales.

01:49:15
<transcript>: Yeah, we'll do that as a check Mark instead. What do I do when you get it right? I don't remember because I never get it wrong.

01:49:25
<transcript>: Look at me. I'm getting like I'm getting arrogant about a game I made. Look how for vision. I don't actually know this one.

01:49:39
<transcript>: Okay, I'm gonna say the wrong thing. It's Proton, but I'm gonna do that because I want to see. Okay, so I do an X for that. I need to color that X better. Okay. So rank two, so that's the rank is working up sash connectivity. All that is good.

01:49:46
<transcript>: But I don't actually want to display rank.

01:49:49
<transcript>: In that way. I want to.

01:49:56
<transcript>: I want to show the leaderboard right and where your score sits. On the leaderboard.

01:50:02
<transcript>: So to do that.

01:50:05
<transcript>: We're gonna have to do some more heavy lifting here.

01:50:05
<transcript>: in our game around

01:50:06
<transcript>: In our game around.

01:50:09
okufa_f: how are you liking trpc so far?

01:50:10
zirus16: maybe the NAME the main title larger, it sees like smaller for me

01:50:11
<transcript>: So we have the rank. That's great. Now what we have to do.

01:50:11
<transcript>: is

01:50:14
<transcript>: Is populate a scoreboard.

01:50:22
<transcript>: Let's see. How are you like in PrPC? I love TrpC. It's been great. It really is convenient.

01:50:24
<transcript>: Maybe the name.

01:50:24
<transcript>: the main title

01:50:27
<transcript>: The main title. Larger it seems.

01:50:27
<transcript>: smaller

01:50:30
<transcript>: Smaller for you. You talk about the AW guests up here.

01:50:30
<transcript>: this whole time

01:50:32
<transcript>: This whole time.

01:50:36
<transcript>: Is like a work improvement progress. We got to put some links up here.

01:50:36
<transcript>: so i'm gonna have

01:50:37
<transcript>: So I'm gonna have, like.

01:50:37
<transcript>: the leaderboard

01:50:41
<transcript>: The leaderboard link and maybe my games and then a logout button.

01:50:47
<transcript>: I think I'm just gonna make the whole thing look the same on mobile and desktop is just gonna be like.

01:50:47
<transcript>: optimized

01:50:54
<transcript>: Optimized for mobile and then desktop just has a lot of extra space. I think that's the plan on that front. Okay, so if we have.

01:50:59
<transcript>: What is the leaderboard? Let's see we want to have like.

01:51:01
<transcript>: Stuff about the user so their avatar.

01:51:07
<transcript>: Their Avatar, their name, or their Twitter handle or whatever.

01:51:15
<transcript>: Maybe a link to their Twitter. If they log in with Twitter, we're gonna make it where you can log in with Discord and Twitter, I guess.

01:51:15
<transcript>: is that best

01:51:17
<transcript>: Is that best? What should I do.

01:51:17
<transcript>: twitter

01:51:32
<transcript>: Twitter and I don't want to just do Twitter, even though that's where I plan on showing this thing and like sharing it. But like a lot of people are leaving Twitter and I don't know, I don't want to just have Twitter is the only auth should they do Twitter. And like get Hub or Twitter.

01:51:39
<transcript>: Google doesn't make sense for a bunch of Amazon people.

01:51:39
<transcript>: yeah what

01:51:42
<transcript>: Yeah. What should I do? I don't know.

01:51:44
andreull: twitter and google

01:51:48
andreull: cause google is most used?

01:51:58
okufa_f: my twitter experience has been virtually unchanged from my end, except for the elon memes

01:51:59
<transcript>: I want to show information about the person, their score when the game was. I think that's it Twitter and Google. That's Andres vote who Google's most used. Yeah, I don't want to. I just don't want to set up email. I just don't want to set up, like email and magic links and all that stuff.

01:51:59
<transcript>: just feels like

01:52:01
<transcript>: Just feels like I don't know.

01:52:04
<transcript>: The whole thing. I don't want to set up.

01:52:13
mattmancodes: Github would be a decent choice

01:52:14
zirus16: github or google.

01:52:22
andreull: twitter + 1.5 mil new users in last 7 days

01:52:24
<transcript>: My Twitter experience has been virtually unchanged from my end, except for the Eon memes. Yeah, same here. I haven't experienced anything really out of the ordinary. There's been a couple little cracks. I guess I've seen like where like you click on a tweet and all the replies who are above it. That's kind of weird. And I don't get numbers for my Tweet notifications anymore, but not a big deal. Get up would be decent. Yeah. If you're like a.

01:52:24
<transcript>: developer

01:52:26
<transcript>: Developer you would have GitHub.

01:52:28
<transcript>: I.

01:52:33
<transcript>: 'm gonna Google, Yeah, I think I should have Twitter and something.

01:52:33
<transcript>: and

01:52:45
<transcript>: And I think the problem with discord I was gonna do to discord, but I don't you have, like, a public profile with discord. Do you like throwing the link to that person's? Discord? Could you even do that? I don't know.

01:52:45
<transcript>: so

01:52:47
oetziofficial: hi, adam I listened to the Twitter Drama podcast and it was hilarious and very nice! :D

01:52:48
<transcript>: So maybe GitHub, maybe we'll do Twitter and GitHub.

01:52:51
<transcript>: And hope that that covers everybody.

01:52:51
<transcript>: oh

01:52:56
<transcript>: Oh, Etsy, I listen to the Twitter Domain podcast. It was layers and very nice. Thanks.

01:52:56
<transcript>: i

01:53:03
okufa_f: you can post on hacker news

01:53:03
<transcript>: I've loved recording those podcasts episodes with DAX when I did AWS FM, every episode kind of felt like work.

01:53:03
<transcript>: and

01:53:07
<transcript>: And it does not feel that way with how about tomorrow? It feels like.

01:53:07
<transcript>: i'm just

01:53:10
<transcript>: I'm just talking to DAX, and I like talking to DAX.

01:53:10
<transcript>: okay

01:53:12
<transcript>: Okay rank.

01:53:12
<transcript>: so

01:53:14
<transcript>: So now we need to get.

01:53:14
<transcript>: the

01:53:16
<transcript>: The game out.

01:53:16
<transcript>: that

01:53:23
<transcript>: That surround your result. Okay. And I think the way to do that with Redis, I think.

01:53:23
<transcript>: is

01:53:28
<transcript>: Is I thought I could just search like Redis sorted set get.

01:53:30
<transcript>: Surrounding.

01:53:32
<transcript>: Score.

01:53:34
zirus16: idk, i think twitter is not the right choice, for me Gh & google would cover the all.

01:53:34
<transcript>: Authors like got to be aware.

01:53:37
<transcript>: Between Min and Max.

01:53:42
<transcript>: Range.

01:53:51
<transcript>: The kids are wondering my office. I think they must be coming for Larvars. But.

01:53:58
<transcript>: Haven't went in the closet.

01:53:59
okufa_f: hey kids

01:54:00
<transcript>: Hi guys.

01:54:02
<transcript>: This is funny.

01:54:02
<transcript>: okay

01:54:07
<transcript>: Okay, I'm switching over here. Hey, kids. Twitch says Hi, kids.

01:54:07
<transcript>: i'm gonna come over

01:54:13
<transcript>: I'm gonna come over here so you can see them behind me. This is funnier to me if you see them like getting into the Lar bars.

01:54:16
<transcript>: There you go.

01:54:19
kj11053: Aw

01:54:19
<transcript>: The big one's gonna come in and grab one, too, I think.

01:54:22
kj11053: <3

01:54:26
<transcript>: Post it on Hacker news.

01:54:31
<transcript>: Oh yeah, I could post AW guess on hacker news. That's true. There goes the big one.

01:54:31
<transcript>: he's getting

01:54:33
<transcript>: He's getting a liar. Bar.

01:54:33
<transcript>: this has

01:54:39
<transcript>: This has become like a daily thing. They come in here, they get Lar bars. I don't know what they're doing in the closet, though.

01:54:39
<transcript>: i think

01:54:41
<transcript>: I think for the ball of KJ.

01:54:41
<transcript>: you

01:54:47
<transcript>: You're getting containers, okay? They're doing Crass, and they need containers for their crafts.

01:54:53
okufa_f: how is being a dad like

01:54:54
<transcript>: I think Twitter is not the right choice for me. Github and Google would cover the all. Okay.

01:54:54
<transcript>: okay

01:54:55
<transcript>: Okay.

01:54:59
<transcript>: Google and my Casey love you.

01:54:59
<transcript>: my wife

01:55:01
<transcript>: My wife is adhere to.

01:55:03
<transcript>: Okay.

01:55:03
<transcript>: everyone is

01:55:07
<transcript>: Everyone is left my office so now I'm gonna go back.

01:55:07
<transcript>: to do it

01:55:09
<transcript>: To do it. I was doing.

01:55:09
<transcript>: how is being

01:55:16
<transcript>: How is being a dad like it's the best. Being a dad is the absolute best. I love being a dad.

01:55:23
<transcript>: Sometimes I forget that. I just feels weird to say, like, I'm a dad. I don't know something about it. You just think of your day.

01:55:23
<transcript>: and like

01:55:26
<transcript>: And like I don't feel like I'm not old yet. But I guess I am.

01:55:34
<transcript>: Managing old elements by time stamp. What so I want I want the surrounding.

01:55:37
<transcript>: The surrounding scores.

01:55:39
samjandwich: might just be me, but if github auth is available then that's the one i pick

01:55:43
<transcript>: Nearest elements, score, and sort of set. Oh, that's kind of what I want.

01:55:43
<transcript>: that's

01:55:49
<transcript>: That's what I want to find. The merest elements you first have to call Zrang to attain their minimum. We've got that.

01:55:49
<transcript>: follow it with a

01:55:53
<transcript>: Follow it with a Z range to Fest the closest members from the rank.

01:55:53
<transcript>: to the rank

01:55:58
<transcript>: To the rank plus one. What so Z range zero to two.

01:56:00
<transcript>: So I'm.

01:56:00
<transcript>: rank

01:56:02
<transcript>: Rank is one.

01:56:02
<transcript>: oh

01:56:07
<transcript>: Oh, so range gives you the ranks. Yes. Right.

01:56:15
<transcript>: Range. Let's just see Zrank. Oh, not Z. Range.

01:56:15
<transcript>: i can

01:56:20
<transcript>: I can. I can specify a range. And it gives me the ranks around it.

01:56:20
<transcript>: or the ele

01:56:22
<transcript>: Or the elements around it. Is that right.

01:56:22
<transcript>: specified

01:56:24
<transcript>: Specified range of elements in the sort of set.

01:56:27
<transcript>: Key Start stop.

01:56:30
<transcript>: Oh, you can do by index.

01:56:30
<transcript>: or

01:56:37
<transcript>: Or by score. Or by lexographic. Okay, what we want by index. Right? Think for the follow. Fulltime.

01:56:42
<transcript>: If GitHub office is available, that's one you'll pick. Okay.

01:56:42
<transcript>: so

01:56:56
<transcript>: So that's great. If everyone in chat that wants to could just like, tell me what you prefer to off with if you were playing this game. Now granted, the ATVs community is a little different. It's not just developers. There are a lot of people that work at Amazon that'll want to play this game.

01:56:56
<transcript>: like i

01:57:00
zirus16: hey why not github adn aws, is a aws auth?

01:57:04
<transcript>: Like, I can't just do, like, GitHub and GitLab. I do think GitHub covers a swath of people who are interested in AWS. There's a lot of developers.

01:57:09
okufa_f: github/google/discord

01:57:10
bodhihawkenmusic: whatevers quickest! github probably?

01:57:12
<transcript>: But I also need to cover the basis of just like people who are in native community, and they're not they're not engineers. They don't have a GitHub for any reason.

01:57:14
lilfreezi: discord auth is nice

01:57:15
<transcript>: So I think that's where Twitter could be useful.

01:57:15
<transcript>: that's

01:57:22
<transcript>: That's where I'm gonna be. That's where I hang out the most in terms of, like, Twitter, the AWS community on Twitter is kind of like.

01:57:31
<transcript>: My people thank you for the follow oath. Oof OOH Oof discord? Auth is nice. Nice. Yeah. So this.

01:57:32
okufa_f: my people

01:57:33
<transcript>: Chord would work too.

01:57:35
rydeenxrising: SSO or twitter.

01:57:39
<transcript>: Let's see. Hey, why not GitHub and AWS is there is no AWS off. Unfortunately.

01:57:39
<transcript>: github

01:57:41
mattmancodes: twitter and github - covers the most bases

01:57:41
cowfacedude99: gh for me. google/twitter would be close second

01:57:42
<transcript>: Github, Google Discord. Yeah, okay.

01:57:42
<transcript>: whatever's quickest

01:57:51
<transcript>: Whatever's quickest GitHub probably. I mean, I can add more OAuth providers pretty quickly. There's not really like a lot of pain. There next sauce kind of makes all that easy.

01:57:54
<transcript>: Sso, or Twitter.

01:57:57
<transcript>: Twitter and GitHub covers the most bases.

01:57:57
<transcript>: get up for

01:58:05
<transcript>: Get up for me. Google. Twitter would be close second. Okay, so we'll do. We'll do Twitter and GitHub. I think that's probably where I was leaning anyway.

01:58:12
<transcript>: And then I did like discord. But the problem with this word is if I want to like, have where there's links to see people's.

01:58:24
<transcript>: Page. Like if you want to go to their Twitter, you just click on their thing and it takes you to their Twitter so you can see who has what scores. But with Discord, is there like a public kind of like link to anything public for this cord user? I don't know.

01:58:27
<transcript>: Okay.

01:58:27
<transcript>: z

01:58:40
<transcript>: Zrange by score. We want by index, which sounds like is the default. We don't want Score or lexographical, so just a Z range and we can just do yeah, yeah, this is what I want. Okay, let's do it right now.

01:58:43
<transcript>: So oh, but I can't.

01:58:43
<transcript>: add

01:58:44
<transcript>: Add.

01:58:47
<transcript>: The one to it yet.

01:58:51
<transcript>: Right. Because we need to actually search with the real rank.

01:58:53
<transcript>: How do I want to do this.

01:59:00
<transcript>: Just call this the rank, and let's just say we're gonna need to add one to it when we return it.

01:59:03
<transcript>: So. Comps.

01:59:04
cowfacedude99: although with all of the twitter mess recently....

01:59:10
<transcript>: Human.

01:59:13
<transcript>: Hunting right.

01:59:16
<transcript>: And plus one, it's gonna say I can't do that.

01:59:20
<transcript>: We're gonna say rank.

01:59:22
<transcript>: Else.

01:59:25
<transcript>: Or I guess no.

01:59:25
<transcript>: why everything

01:59:30
<transcript>: Why? Everything's null here. It shouldn't be in the find. I don't know. Counting. Rank.

01:59:32
<transcript>: Okay.

01:59:32
<transcript>: so

01:59:36
<transcript>: So what I want to do now is I want to do a Z range.

01:59:36
<transcript>: comps

01:59:37
<transcript>: Comps.

01:59:41
<transcript>: A Weight Redis.

01:59:41
<transcript>: z

01:59:48
<transcript>: Zrange. So I need to do reverse range. No, this is maybe Rev.

01:59:48
<transcript>: range

01:59:50
<transcript>: Range? Yeah.

01:59:50
<transcript>: we want

01:59:51
<transcript>: We want like.

01:59:51
<transcript>: top to bottom

01:59:55
<transcript>: Top to bottom? Yeah, yeah, we just did a reverse ranks. We need to do reverse range.

01:59:55
<transcript>: score

01:59:57
<transcript>: Scores.

01:59:57
<transcript>: and we're gonna

02:00:03
<transcript>: And we're gonna pass, what the start? And the stop. So if I want to go, like, plus.

02:00:03
<transcript>: five

02:00:04
<transcript>: Five.

02:00:04
<transcript>: on each side

02:00:07
<transcript>: On each side. We'll do three, so I'll do.

02:00:07
<transcript>: rank

02:00:09
<transcript>: Rank.

02:00:09
<transcript>: rank

02:00:11
<transcript>: Rank minus three.

02:00:11
<transcript>: and

02:00:15
<transcript>: And rank plus three. What to do if you go out of range? Does it say.

02:00:20
<transcript>: What options? Limit.

02:00:27
<transcript>: Default. The command performs an index range query the start and stop our represent zero based indices.

02:00:38
<transcript>: These arguments find inclusive range for Yep, that's fine. My kids are screaming. Now. Indices can also be negative numbers indicating offsets from the end of the sort set.

02:00:38
<transcript>: out of range

02:00:47
<transcript>: Out of range indices do not produce an error. Okay, cool. Do not produce an error. It start is greater than E to the index or the sorted index.

02:00:49
<transcript>: Wait.

02:00:51
<transcript>: I need to list your return. Okay.

02:00:51
<transcript>: cool

02:00:55
<transcript>: Cool. This is gonna work. So we're gonna get the surrounding.

02:00:59
<transcript>: The surrounding three elements. Right.

02:00:59
<transcript>: that would happen here

02:01:00
<transcript>: That would happen here.

02:01:00
<transcript>: what do i have

02:01:02
<transcript>: What do I have errors. Now.

02:01:11
okufa_f: screen capture froze

02:01:12
<transcript>: We have the rank.

02:01:16
<transcript>: Oh rank can be undefined.

02:01:19
<transcript>: Can I just do this.

02:01:23
<transcript>: What's wrong with that.

02:01:25
<transcript>: I should just not do.

02:01:25
<transcript>: this

02:01:25
cowfacedude99: again :(

02:01:30
<transcript>: This next step if there's no rank, if no rank, or if rank.

02:01:35
cowfacedude99: ^

02:01:38
<transcript>: If Frank, we're gonna do this.

02:01:38
<transcript>: we're gonna

02:01:41
<transcript>: We're gonna get the so now we need to kind of like hydrate.

02:01:41
<transcript>: we're gonna have this

02:01:44
<transcript>: We're gonna have this collection of Game IDs.

02:01:46
<transcript>: Right.

02:01:51
<transcript>: This is a string array. Yeah. So.

02:01:51
<transcript>: that's a collection

02:01:54
<transcript>: That's a collection of Game IDs. We're gonna need to, like.

02:02:00
<transcript>: Hydrate, the leaderboard records from a bunch of game IDs. Okay.

02:02:04
<transcript>: screen capture froze

02:02:04
<transcript>: driving

02:02:05
<transcript>: Driving me crazy today.

02:02:05
<transcript>: obs

02:02:06
cowfacedude99: you need to check the obs install LUL @adamdotdev

02:02:07
<transcript>: Obs with.

02:02:07
<transcript>: the

02:02:09
<transcript>: The violence.

02:02:11
<transcript>: Just.

02:02:11
<transcript>: that's so annoying

02:02:13
<transcript>: That's so annoying. Okay.

02:02:13
<transcript>: now

02:02:18
<transcript>: Now it should be back. Need to check the OBS install? Yeah, I need to probably do an update.

02:02:28
<transcript>: I think for the follow unbelievable Voldemort unavailable Voldemodemort and yellow.

02:02:28
<transcript>: thank you for

02:02:29
<transcript>: Thank you for the follows.

02:02:35
<transcript>: Okay. So if we have a set of game IDs, we're gonna say.

02:02:35
<transcript>: kant's

02:02:37
<transcript>: Kant's games.

02:02:41
<transcript>: Our Scores equals.

02:02:45
<transcript>: Weight hydrate.

02:02:48
<transcript>: Scores or leaderboard.

02:02:51
<transcript>: We'll call it scores.

02:02:53
<transcript>: Result.

02:02:57
<transcript>: results

02:02:58
<transcript>: Results.

02:03:01
<transcript>: We'll write it. Let's see. Lib.

02:03:08
<transcript>: I have a place where I'm putting like actual.

02:03:08
<transcript>: logic

02:03:12
<transcript>: Logic and stuff. No, I'm just putting in this file. Forget it.

02:03:20
<transcript>: Let's see. Do I have any functions up here? That I'm. Yeah, like this one just inlining stuff. We'll move this. I'll just move this.

02:03:20
<transcript>: down

02:03:23
<transcript>: Down to the bottom of the pot of the file, right here.

02:03:32
<transcript>: Same thing.

02:03:32
<transcript>: i think there

02:03:34
<transcript>: I think there is another one.

02:03:35
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:03:43
<transcript>: Okay. So we're putting all these functions at the bottom of the file.

02:03:49
<transcript>: Look at this one right here async function.

02:03:49
<transcript>: hydra

02:03:56
cowfacedude99: I think I got my gcp cloud associate certification.

02:03:59
<transcript>: Hydrate scores because we're gonna have to do this from a few different places. I think because we're gonna have like, a leaderboard query where you can just fetch the leaderboard, like at the top.

02:04:06
<transcript>: I think I got my GCP cloud Associate certification. I was gonna ask how face, how the test went. Did it go well? Were you, like.

02:04:06
<transcript>: did you feel good about it

02:04:10
<transcript>: Did you feel good about it and you still you're not sure if you have results yet.

02:04:23
<transcript>: Because like the AWS ones, you get the results immediately, like Sugarfish the exam. You know how you did.

02:04:28
<transcript>: Hydrate scores. This is going to be a.

02:04:33
<transcript>: Dot. Games or Game IDs.

02:04:36
<transcript>: Is that how you do that.

02:04:45
<transcript>: You're remember? Yeah. So I can just, like, pass one game ID in or multiple and it'll work. Yeah.

02:04:51
<transcript>: Okay. So what I need to do is for each of these game. I.

02:04:54
<transcript>: 'd Be like one big Prisma thing.

02:04:54
<transcript>: cops

02:04:54
cowfacedude99: the test said that I passed. but the certification will take a week. so waiting for the cert till monday

02:04:56
<transcript>: Cops, Games, equals.

02:05:00
<transcript>: Yeah? I need.

<transcript>: in

02:05:30
<transcript>: In.

02:05:32
<transcript>: Oh, can Yes.

02:05:36
<transcript>: In Game IDs.

02:05:41
<transcript>: Does that work? So just nail that first try.

02:05:45
<transcript>: Yes.

02:05:50
<transcript>: Customer promised game oh, yeah? I gotta await that.

02:05:59
<transcript>: Okay, so that's our game. That just is that just gonna work? Like I pass an array of game IDs. It gets me all those games we want to include.

02:06:02
<transcript>: The user.

02:06:04
<transcript>: What do I do here.

02:06:04
<transcript>: i can specify

02:06:07
<transcript>: I can specify like us.

02:06:09
<transcript>: Like fields or something.

02:06:21
<transcript>: Let's just do this. Prisma.

02:06:21
<transcript>: pris

02:06:23
<transcript>: Prisma.

02:06:28
<transcript>: Include fields? Can I like specify which fields.

02:06:33
<transcript>: Include.

02:06:39
<transcript>: Post true? Yeah? Here we go.

02:06:39
<transcript>: include

02:06:43
<transcript>: Include author that's all fields, but what if I want to include.

02:06:45
<transcript>: Specific.

02:06:50
<transcript>: Relations fields. Here we go.

02:07:00
<transcript>: Where select posts. Select how okay. So it's not actually what use a nested. Select to choose a subset of relation fields to return.

02:07:00
<transcript>: for example

02:07:05
<transcript>: For example, the following query returns the names user. Also, I don't need to do the include at all.

02:07:07
<transcript>: So it says.

02:07:14
<transcript>: Or I can, I can nest it inside of here. We're just going to do a select we're just gonna do instead of this.

02:07:17
<transcript>: We're gonna just do Select.

02:07:19
<transcript>: Select.

02:07:23
<transcript>: I can say what I want, so I want these ID.

02:07:25
<transcript>: How does this work.

02:07:28
<transcript>: Select.

02:07:32
<transcript>: Epsilon for everything I want, right.

02:07:34
<transcript>: True.

02:07:37
<transcript>: What do I want for this leaderboard.

02:07:39
<transcript>: Id.

02:07:41
<transcript>: User.

02:07:47
<transcript>: And this is where we're going to specify, oh, what in the world.

02:07:52
<transcript>: User, it's gonna be there.

02:07:54
<transcript>: Id.

02:07:57
<transcript>: Oh, I'm saying clue.

02:07:59
<transcript>: What I could just do.

02:07:59
<transcript>: go ahead

02:08:04
<transcript>: Go ahead to do a post select inside of the user. Okay.

02:08:06
<transcript>: Select.

02:08:06
<transcript>: we're gonna

02:08:09
<transcript>: We're gonna do image.

02:08:15
<transcript>: We're gonna do is it name true.

02:08:15
<transcript>: we're

02:08:17
<transcript>: We're gonna do.

02:08:19
<transcript>: What else is on a user.

02:08:29
<transcript>: That's what they have. A name, an email.

02:08:29
<transcript>: an image

02:08:31
<transcript>: An image.

02:08:33
<transcript>: Count.

02:08:38
<transcript>: That's where I'm gonna be able to get like a link to their Twitter, for example.

02:08:49
<transcript>: So account is where I could get the.

02:08:49
<transcript>: like

02:08:54
<transcript>: Like ID. And so user ID. Is there like an avatar or something? I have a ton.

02:09:00
<transcript>: Let's just look at it. I've logged in. So we've got this.

02:09:04
<transcript>: Prisma.

02:09:04
<transcript>: i want the

02:09:06
<transcript>: I want the Prisma studio.

02:09:08
<transcript>: Seems easier to work with.

02:09:08
<transcript>: we want to look

02:09:10
<transcript>: We want to look at user.

02:09:13
<transcript>: There is my user.

02:09:15
<transcript>: As an image.

02:09:17
<transcript>: An account.

02:09:21
<transcript>: Twitter.

02:09:24
<transcript>: So I have my handle or anything. Oh, it doesn't have my handle.

02:09:26
<transcript>: Oh.

02:09:26
<transcript>: bummer

02:09:28
<transcript>: Bummer.

02:09:35
<transcript>: Can I store the handle? I would like to. Soar the handle, please.

02:09:46
<transcript>: So nowhere when I do Twitter auth I don't get their Twitter handle by default. I would have to like.

02:09:50
<transcript>: Actually store that.

02:09:53
<transcript>: Session.

02:09:57
<transcript>: Interesting.

02:09:57
<transcript>: the

02:10:04
<transcript>: The test said that I passed that certification will take a week. So waiting for the Cert till Monday. Okay, so you don't have a Cert yet, but you passed.

02:10:04
<transcript>: so

02:10:05
cowfacedude99: did you leak secrets just now?

02:10:06
<transcript>: So cool, good luck.

02:10:06
<transcript>: congratulations

02:10:08
<transcript>: Congratulations, cow face.

02:10:13
webdev33: You get an auth token that you can use to obtain that

02:10:13
<transcript>: Yeah. Coffee. Something. I just leaked all kinds of stuff.

02:10:15
<transcript>: Feels bad.

02:10:17
zerkbtw: what auth providers are you using?

02:10:22
<transcript>: You get an off token that you can use to obtain that. So I'm gonna have to do that.

02:10:34
webdev33: You hit the twitter api with that auth token

02:10:35
<transcript>: What? I'll providers. We're gonna use Twitter and we're gonna use GitHub. I think actually, I can just amend. I can just update next box. Let's see. I can just do this with a callback in Next sauce. Yeah.

02:10:35
<transcript>: yeah

02:10:36
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:10:42
<transcript>: Okay, let's just do this. So session. We're already putting the user ID.

02:10:42
<transcript>: on

02:10:45
<transcript>: On the session.

02:10:45
<transcript>: let's add

02:10:45
webdev33: or use a callback yea

02:10:46
zerkbtw: create t3?

02:10:48
<transcript>: Let's add a callback for.

02:10:48
<transcript>: is it

02:10:50
aryan_kamboj: can someone tell me what font is this?

02:10:52
<transcript>: Is it login. Let's see next. Off.

02:10:56
<transcript>: Callbacks.

02:10:59
devinda_me: yep it is t3

02:11:00
<transcript>: Come tell me what font this is. Operator mono.

02:11:11
<transcript>: Yeah. You hit the Twitter API with that autoken or use a callback. Yeah. We'll just do it when you sign up. We'll just capture it there because it's in, like the profile or something. Right.

02:11:11
<transcript>: session

02:11:16
<transcript>: Session so it's signin is my I want.

02:11:20
<transcript>: Sign in.

02:11:26
<transcript>: User Account profile.

02:11:26
<transcript>: email

02:11:28
<transcript>: Email.

02:11:28
<transcript>: just grab it all

02:11:29
<transcript>: Just grab it all.

02:11:29
<transcript>: credentials

02:11:34
<transcript>: Credentials. I don't need the credentials, but I'm gonna do all this anyway.

02:11:36
<transcript>: Okay.

02:11:36
<transcript>: and

02:11:37
<transcript>: And then.

02:11:37
<transcript>: i

02:11:39
<transcript>: I return.

02:11:39
<transcript>: true

02:11:41
<transcript>: True.

02:11:42
zerkbtw: love the setup

02:11:44
<transcript>: So this is where I could say.

02:11:45
zerkbtw: got public dot files?

02:11:48
<transcript>: Like don't don't give them permission.

02:11:52
<transcript>: Is this the callback I want to user that one actually use.

02:11:56
<transcript>: If they're allowed.

02:11:56
<transcript>: okay

02:11:58
<transcript>: Okay. That's all I want.

02:12:06
<transcript>: When do I for sure get the let's see redirect callback is called anytime users redirected to a callback.

02:12:10
<transcript>: I want to know when do I get that profile.

02:12:10
<transcript>: jot

02:12:12
<transcript>: Jot callback.

02:12:16
<transcript>: When they create this JSON web token.

02:12:23
<transcript>: Session callbacks call whenever session is checked. No, not that one.

02:12:25
zerkbtw: you want to use the session callback, you need to pass the user data into the user object there

02:12:30
<transcript>: I do have public dot files. Yes, Sir.

02:12:30
<transcript>: it

02:12:31
adamdotdev: !dotfiles

02:12:32
fossabot: Adam's dotfiles live here: https://github.com/adamelmore/dotfiles The repository for bitter is here: https://github.com/adamelmore/bitter

02:12:32
<transcript>: It is.

02:12:35
<transcript>: It's just that files. Yeah.

02:12:37
<transcript>: Also welcome to Chat. Arian.

02:12:44
<transcript>: And this is Create T three. That's right. I just did. The whole reason I started this project was to play with the T three. Stack.

02:12:44
<transcript>: it's not

02:12:48
<transcript>: It's not my typical stack, so I wanted to kind of like, learn some things.

02:12:48
<transcript>: do i want

02:12:52
<transcript>: Do I want to use the signin callback? Is this after you've actually let's see.

02:13:03
<transcript>: When using credentials provider the user object in the response return from the outfits callback and the profile object is a raw body. Okay. Is this the one I want? Then sign it. Let's just log.

02:13:07
<transcript>: Console log, user.

02:13:11
<transcript>: Account.

02:13:15
<transcript>: Profile. Okay, let's just try that.

02:13:25
<transcript>: Okay, thank you for the follow. Arian and gooey.

02:13:29
<transcript>: Okay, let's just log in again.

02:13:33
<transcript>: Let's log in again.

02:13:45
<transcript>: I don't even have a login button until you get to the end of a game. Okay, we're gonna get these. All right, so we can end the game faster.

02:13:54
<transcript>: Is that right? No.

02:13:54
<transcript>: techn

02:13:56
<transcript>: Technoprack thank you for the follow.

02:13:56
<transcript>: all right

02:14:02
<transcript>: All right, so this game's gonna end our rank is gonna be bad.

02:14:06
<transcript>: We don't have bugs in the server right now.

02:14:06
<transcript>: finalize line

02:14:07
<transcript>: Finalize line might not be working.

02:14:07
<transcript>: sign in

02:14:10
<transcript>: Sign in with Twitter. Here we go.

02:14:14
<transcript>: So I'm gonna see all this information.

02:14:14
<transcript>: dumped

02:14:16
<transcript>: Dumped in here.

02:14:16
<transcript>: the

02:14:21
<transcript>: The first one has that stuff that's the user the next one.

02:14:29
<transcript>: Oh, no, the next one does not. It has secrets. But then the profile. The profiles where we get my screen name. Okay.

02:14:33
<transcript>: So Profile screen name will be our Twitter.

02:14:33
<transcript>: we're gonna

02:14:37
<transcript>: We're gonna add that. I want to add that to something.

02:14:42
<transcript>: I got to store it because it won't be.

02:14:42
<transcript>: it

02:14:45
<transcript>: It won't be stored on the user, otherwise.

02:14:45
<transcript>: let's see if

02:14:48
<transcript>: Let's see if somebody's just done this next off.

02:14:48
<transcript>: store

02:14:51
<transcript>: Store Twitter Handle on.

02:14:56
<transcript>: In database like how can I influence what's stored.

02:14:56
<transcript>: i don't have

02:14:58
<transcript>: I don't have to have custom adapter, do I.

02:15:01
<transcript>: Store information.

02:15:11
<transcript>: Oh, I guess the reason you wouldn't want to do that, you wouldn't want to store it if they change their username.

02:15:14
<transcript>: Then how would you know about it.

02:15:14
<transcript>: am i

02:15:17
<transcript>: Am I supposed to like fetch their username.

02:15:24
<transcript>: What I want to do here.

02:15:28
<transcript>: Maybe I should just bail on the idea of linking to people's, Twitter.

02:15:45
<transcript>: We're gonna have, like, a page for each user and you can see all their game history. Yeah, yeah, that's what we'll do. We'll link to a page for that user. It'll have all their game history.

02:15:45
<transcript>: and

02:15:48
<transcript>: And on there we can link to their Twitter and any other oh off account.

02:15:48
<transcript>: that's what we'll do

02:15:50
<transcript>: That's what we'll do, right.

02:15:50
<transcript>: does that make sense

02:15:51
<transcript>: Does that make sense.

02:15:54
<transcript>: Think that makes sense.

02:15:58
<transcript>: I think so.

02:16:01
<transcript>: Okay.

02:16:01
<transcript>: so

02:16:05
<transcript>: So then let's see. I don't need to do anything here.

02:16:05
<transcript>: let's just

02:16:06
<transcript>: Let's just.

02:16:22
<transcript>: Okay, just removing the signin. Callback for now. We're gonna come in and add the GitHub one later.

02:16:25
<transcript>: Okay.

02:16:29
<transcript>: So here.

02:16:29
<transcript>: we were

02:16:32
<transcript>: We were in the game. Router. Still.

02:16:34
<transcript>: Where let's see.

02:16:40
<transcript>: So Games Select ID. We want to select the.

02:16:40
<transcript>: score

02:16:42
<transcript>: Score.

02:16:45
<transcript>: We're going to select the streak.

02:16:49
<transcript>: Oh, no, I'm sorry. The longest.

02:16:54
<transcript>: That's our longest streak.

02:17:02
<transcript>: What else we've got the ID user select image or name and image.

02:17:02
<transcript>: anything else

02:17:04
<transcript>: Anything else.

02:17:14
<transcript>: The ID. I guess we should do the ID, even though technically the idea we can just get straight from the up here like the user ID. But that's fine.

02:17:14
<transcript>: actually

02:17:16
<transcript>: Actually I want to do.

02:17:18
<transcript>: User ID.

02:17:21
<transcript>: I don't know why.

02:17:21
<transcript>: but i want

02:17:23
<transcript>: But I want to do it that way.

02:17:27
<transcript>: User ID Longest score thank for the follow coding is weird.

02:17:27
<transcript>: that's a great hand

02:17:30
<transcript>: That's a great handle coating is weird.

02:17:30
<transcript>: okay

02:17:35
<transcript>: Okay, so we have ID. We have score longest. We have user ID.

02:17:42
<transcript>: And then on the user, we're selecting the name and the image. Anything else that I need from a leaderboard.

02:17:46
<transcript>: Where ID in games, just like that, right.

02:17:49
<transcript>: That.

02:17:58
<transcript>: Just do. There we go. So it's got shape, just like I specified. Cool. Okay.

02:18:01
<transcript>: I think that's good.

02:18:01
<transcript>: is that good

02:18:03
<transcript>: Is that good.

02:18:09
<transcript>: So that's gonna.

02:18:09
<transcript>: just return

02:18:11
<transcript>: Just return games.

02:18:17
<transcript>: hydrate scores what's wrong with this

02:18:21
<transcript>: String is not as like, oh, I got to add Prisma.

02:18:24
<transcript>: Context. Prisma.

02:18:24
<transcript>: okay

02:18:25
<transcript>: Okay.

02:18:25
<transcript>: now what's wrong

02:18:26
<transcript>: Now, what's wrong.

02:18:32
<transcript>: So can I not do it this way.

02:18:35
<transcript>: Game IDs. Can you not do this.

02:18:42
spartangtr: hydrate? is this some new term? is that like seed data?

02:18:43
<transcript>: Can I not anybody know.

02:18:45
<transcript>: I just need to be like this.

02:18:51
<transcript>: Yes. Okay. Scores.

02:18:55
<transcript>: So those are all of our.

02:18:59
<transcript>: Scores. It's an array that shaped like that.

02:19:02
<transcript>: We're just gonna return.

02:19:08
<transcript>: Oh, and then on each one of those, I need to add the rank. The respective rank.

02:19:08
<transcript>: do i know they're

02:19:10
<transcript>: Do I know they're ranks.

02:19:13
<transcript>: Oh, wait, do I know their ranks easily.

02:19:15
<transcript>: Oh.

02:19:24
<transcript>: Do I know them.

02:19:31
<transcript>: So I guess it'll be the index that they're in. No, no.

02:19:31
<transcript>: it'll be

02:19:33
<transcript>: It'll be.

02:19:35
<transcript>: About this.

02:19:42
lilfreezi: what keys did u press to make the error pop up instead of being on the side

02:19:43
<transcript>: Yeah, Hydrated. It's like I have Game IDs, and I need to get all of the additional.

02:19:43
<transcript>: detail

02:19:47
<transcript>: Detail. I could just named it Fetch Scores, or.

02:19:47
<transcript>: get score

02:19:52
<transcript>: Get scores or something. I guess Hydrates kind of a dumb way of putting that.

02:19:52
<transcript>: now hydrate

02:19:54
<transcript>: Now Hydrate has meaning we should not use.

02:19:59
<transcript>: Let's just now let's do this.

02:20:01
<transcript>: Get.

02:20:01
<transcript>: get

02:20:03
<transcript>: Get scores.

02:20:05
<transcript>: Okay.

02:20:11
<transcript>: What keys did you press to make the error pop up instead of being on the side.

02:20:16
<transcript>: Oh, control. J. I was sorry. I don't have my.

02:20:17
<transcript>: Caster. There we go.

02:20:17
<transcript>: so this

02:20:23
<transcript>: So this was CTRL J. Which takes me to the next diagnostic in the file.

02:20:26
<transcript>: A diagnostic that are coming out of TypeScript.

02:20:26
<transcript>: then

02:20:28
<transcript>: Then shift. K opens up.

02:20:28
<transcript>: that little

02:20:31
<transcript>: That little like definition. Pane, or whatever it's called.

02:20:34
<transcript>: I.

02:20:38
<transcript>: What do we think.

02:20:44
<transcript>: Well, how do I calculate the rank? I want the I want each of these scores to have.

02:20:46
<transcript>: The rank.

02:20:46
<transcript>: so

02:20:47
lilfreezi: oh i see it on the config now i didnt know it was called diagnostic

02:20:50
<transcript>: So I guess the starting rank. I can kind of okay. Here we go.

02:20:50
<transcript>: so

02:20:51
<transcript>: So.

02:20:51
<transcript>: starting

02:20:53
<transcript>: Starting rank.

02:20:55
<transcript>: Start.

02:21:00
<transcript>: First rank would be.

02:21:01
<transcript>: Resolved.

02:21:08
<transcript>: Result links.

02:21:10
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:21:10
<transcript>: because i

02:21:19
<transcript>: Because I got to handle this scenario where, like, if you're number one, there will be no ranks above you. Right. How do I know? Oh, well, the index of so result.

02:21:19
<transcript>: index

02:21:21
<transcript>: Index of.

02:21:24
<transcript>: What are these things.

02:21:28
<transcript>: Are these things? Any.

02:21:28
<transcript>: oh

02:21:29
<transcript>: Oh.

02:21:33
<transcript>: What is this? String array.

02:21:33
<transcript>: oh

02:21:34
<transcript>: Oh.

02:21:34
<transcript>: string

02:21:38
<transcript>: String array. Not what I was expecting. So these are.

02:21:38
<transcript>: oh yeah

02:21:42
<transcript>: Oh, yeah? Yeah? So result so.

02:21:42
<transcript>: result

02:21:50
<transcript>: Result index of it's just gonna be the string the game ID. So this is no, this is not first rank.

02:21:52
<transcript>: This is.

02:21:54
<transcript>: My rank.

02:21:57
<transcript>: Okay.

02:21:58
cowfacedude99: @LilFreezi the vim.diagnostic module has a few good helpers. you should check it out

02:22:06
<transcript>: So we find your game ID, which is definitely going to be part of that set. Okay.

02:22:06
<transcript>: that's

02:22:08
<transcript>: That's.

02:22:08
<transcript>: that

02:22:11
<transcript>: That's the index of that my rank.

02:22:12
<transcript>: Index.

02:22:15
<transcript>: Let's call it.

02:22:16
<transcript>: Rank.

02:22:23
<transcript>: Rank Index. Okay. That's for like the current score. And then.

02:22:23
<transcript>: however

02:22:27
<transcript>: However many above that so then start.

02:22:29
<transcript>: Start index.

02:22:29
<transcript>: or

02:22:31
<transcript>: Or start.

02:22:31
<transcript>: first

02:22:33
<transcript>: First drank.

02:22:41
<transcript>: Would be now I know I have what I need to calculate it. I just mass is hard. So if the rank index were zero, for instance.

02:22:41
<transcript>: that means

02:22:45
<transcript>: That means we only have ranks after you.

02:22:50
<transcript>: So the first rank.

02:22:50
<transcript>: is

02:22:54
<transcript>: Is Rank index.

02:22:56
<transcript>: No rank.

02:22:56
<transcript>: minus ranking

02:22:58
<transcript>: Minus ranking right.

02:22:58
<transcript>: rank

02:23:01
<transcript>: Rank minus rank index.

02:23:08
<transcript>: They're sequential. So if you're ranked five, if you're the fifth best school.

02:23:19
<transcript>: And the index of it is one that means there's only one above you. So that means the first rank is five minus one. So four. Right. Okay. I think so.

02:23:24
<transcript>: Oh, I see it on the fig. Now I didn't know it was called diagnostic.

02:23:28
<transcript>: Okay.

02:23:30
<transcript>: It's okay. I don't know anything.

02:23:30
<transcript>: i don't know anything

02:23:36
<transcript>: I don't know anything. A little Freezey. Anything about Neovem. I just. I use it.

02:23:41
<transcript>: So that's first rank. And then last rank.

02:23:44
<transcript>: Last rank would be the.

02:23:49
<transcript>: First rank plus.

02:23:51
<transcript>: Result.

02:23:51
<transcript>: index

02:23:54
<transcript>: Index or link. Right.

02:23:54
<transcript>: let's play this out

02:23:57
<transcript>: Let's play this out. Let's let's do a fictitious example.

02:24:04
<transcript>: Picture. I didn't do any off by ones I probably did, but let's see we've got.

02:24:04
<transcript>: result

02:24:06
<transcript>: Result. We're gonna name this.

02:24:10
<transcript>: Name is Ray.

02:24:19
<transcript>: And that one's range. Okay.

02:24:22
<transcript>: Oh, and this one's range.

02:24:24
<transcript>: Say what? Oh yeah? Yeah? Okay.

02:24:29
<transcript>: Let's play this out if our range looked like.

02:24:35
<transcript>: It's gonna be a bunch of game ideas. Right? So one.

02:24:37
<transcript>: Two.

02:24:39
<transcript>: Three.

02:24:41
<transcript>: Four.

02:24:41
<transcript>: five

02:24:44
<transcript>: Five. And let's say.

02:24:46
<transcript>: We're gonna add more because.

02:24:51
<transcript>: Let's say this is this middle one is rid.

02:24:54
<transcript>: Okay.

02:24:54
<transcript>: so this

02:24:56
<transcript>: So this is the Game ID.

02:25:02
<transcript>: Game that I. D. Okay.

02:25:07
<transcript>: Then we've got three on either side. Thanks for the follow Ganesh.

02:25:11
<transcript>: So if you got three scores on each side of my game ID.

02:25:19
<transcript>: Then rank index is gonna be index of game ID so 01012 three.

02:25:19
<transcript>: this would be

02:25:21
<transcript>: This would be three.

02:25:23
<transcript>: Okay.

02:25:23
<transcript>: and then

02:25:26
<transcript>: And then first rank would be.

02:25:26
<transcript>: three

02:25:31
<transcript>: Three. I'm sorry. Rank. I should have said rank.

02:25:35
<transcript>: Rank equals what.

02:25:35
<transcript>: would rank

02:25:38
<transcript>: Would rank be I guess it's just doesn't matter.

02:25:44
<transcript>: It could be anywhere in the rain let's save the rank was eight. This was the 8th best score.

02:25:46
<transcript>: Then first rank.

02:25:46
<transcript>: would be

02:25:48
<transcript>: Would be.

02:25:48
<transcript>: eight

02:25:50
<transcript>: Eight, nine.

02:25:52
<transcript>: Three.

02:25:52
<transcript>: which

02:25:57
<transcript>: Which is five. So that means this number one. Here, this game. Number one.

02:25:59
<transcript>: This one.

02:25:59
<transcript>: would be the

02:26:11
<transcript>: Would be the fifth best score. So fistbest score, six best score, 7th best score. And then eight best. Which is my rank. That's what we just set up here. This is an arbitrary number. Okay, so that's correct. First drink is correct.

02:26:11
<transcript>: then

02:26:15
<transcript>: Then first rank is five.

02:26:15
<transcript>: plus

02:26:18
<transcript>: Plus sorry. Five plus.

02:26:30
<transcript>: Rank was it range length, which would be 123-4567 equal. Twelve.

02:26:32
<transcript>: All right. Last rank. No.

02:26:35
<transcript>: Why is this wrong.

02:26:35
<transcript>: first

02:26:38
<transcript>: First rank plus the.

02:26:38
<transcript>: length

02:26:39
<transcript>: Length.

02:26:39
<transcript>: alright right

02:26:40
<transcript>: Alright, right.

02:26:40
<transcript>: if that's eight

02:26:42
<transcript>: If that's 8910.

02:26:42
<transcript>: eight i think

02:26:48
<transcript>: Eight. I think I have an off by one. This is Rank 8910. Eleven.

02:26:48
<transcript>: it should

02:26:50
<transcript>: It should have been.

02:26:55
<transcript>: What did I. How did I mess up? Should I just do length minus one.

02:26:58
<transcript>: Why is that though? Because.

02:27:00
<transcript>: The first one.

02:27:02
<transcript>: So minus one would be.

02:27:08
<transcript>: Eleven. Which is correct. So that's our first and our last ranks.

02:27:08
<transcript>: five

02:27:09
<transcript>: Five to eleven.

02:27:13
<transcript>: Okay if I have that.

02:27:13
<transcript>: then

02:27:20
<transcript>: Then for all the scores that come back, are they gonna be an order? Oh, no. Are they gonna be an order.

02:27:24
<transcript>: The scores might not be an order coming out of the database.

02:27:26
<transcript>: They probably won't be.

02:27:31
<transcript>: Unless now even if I sword them by score, it won't help.

02:27:31
<transcript>: we need

02:27:33
<transcript>: We need to.

02:27:40
<transcript>: We need to assume they're in any order, and we need to do the right thing.

02:27:43
<transcript>: We've got first ranking last rank.

02:27:43
<transcript>: we

02:27:47
<transcript>: We know that range here is in the right order.

02:27:47
<transcript>: this is our

02:27:50
<transcript>: This is our source of truth for the order, range.

02:27:50
<transcript>: so

02:27:52
<transcript>: So then we're gonna say.

02:27:56
<transcript>: Haunts.

02:27:59
<transcript>: Const leaderboard.

02:28:02
<transcript>: Leaderboard equals.

02:28:05
<transcript>: It's gonna be.

02:28:11
<transcript>: Think about this.

02:28:15
<transcript>: We're gonna do like a four of.

02:28:18
<transcript>: Four of.

02:28:19
rotwurm: What do you use to display your keypresses?

02:28:21
<transcript>: Four score.

02:28:22
<transcript>: Four scores.

02:28:24
<transcript>: Seven years ago.

02:28:28
<transcript>: Four constant score of scores.

02:28:34
<transcript>: Do I want to just loop through my range? Let's just loop through the range.

02:28:34
<transcript>: so

02:28:37
<transcript>: So this would be Game ID.

02:28:43
<transcript>: For each game ID we're gonna get the power.

02:28:43
<transcript>: equals

02:28:46
<transcript>: Equals scores find.

02:28:53
<transcript>: For that ID equals Game ID. Okay, there's our score.

02:28:58
<transcript>: Probably better ways to do all this, but it was just humor me. Here.

02:29:02
<transcript>: I guess Leaderboard could have just been.

02:29:08
<transcript>: Just mapped the range. Would that retain the.

02:29:12
<transcript>: So it range map.

02:29:19
<transcript>: What are those? Game ID.

02:29:23
<transcript>: So scores.

02:29:23
<transcript>: find

02:29:24
<transcript>: Find.

02:29:32
<transcript>: That's our leaderboard, right.

02:29:47
<transcript>: Okay. And what is Leaderboard? It's a list of that shape. Yeah.

02:29:51
<transcript>: So then we just I think we just return the leaderboard.

02:29:59
<transcript>: Now it's not a rank. Let's just do it this way. If there's not a rank.

02:30:01
<transcript>: Return.

02:30:04
<transcript>: Empty array. I don't know.

02:30:04
<transcript>: if you

02:30:09
<transcript>: If you don't have a rank, I don't know what that means yet, but then we can delete this.

02:30:16
<transcript>: And are these ranks correct? Are they actually we want to make them.

02:30:20
<transcript>: How do I do this? Oh, because I have to sign the rank. Each of these.

02:30:20
<transcript>: so we're gonna

02:30:22
<transcript>: So we're gonna say.

02:30:29
<transcript>: I want to do this.

02:30:43
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:30:46
<transcript>: Turn.

02:30:52
<transcript>: That's gonna be comps score equals that.

02:30:52
<transcript>: and we're gonna

02:30:53
<transcript>: And we're gonna say.

02:30:53
<transcript>: return

02:30:55
<transcript>: Return.

02:31:01
<transcript>: But then rank is going to be this is we got to figure out what the rank is for the game ID.

02:31:07
<transcript>: How do I do that again? I'm gonna say.

02:31:11
<transcript>: First rank to last rank.

02:31:18
<transcript>: That's what's gonna be index.

02:31:21
<transcript>: First drink plus index.

02:31:29
<transcript>: Here.

02:31:31
<transcript>: Index.

02:31:34
<transcript>: All right? Yeah.

02:31:36
<transcript>: Range.

02:31:37
<transcript>: Right.

02:31:37
<transcript>: i have to p

02:31:43
<transcript>: I have to P again. So that's gonna be our rank, because we want to, oh, and then we want to add one.

02:31:47
<transcript>: Plus one right.

02:31:47
<transcript>: i think

02:31:49
<transcript>: I think that's right.

02:31:53
<transcript>: Return leaderboard.

02:31:56
<transcript>: Board. Okay.

02:32:04
<transcript>: Last rank we didn't actually need. Turns out I don't think.

02:32:08
<transcript>: Index.

02:32:14
<transcript>: Okay.

02:32:18
<transcript>: Let's try it.

02:32:21
otifex: screen frozen? footer and camera looking fine

02:32:22
<transcript>: I need to sign it. I'm already signed in. Cool.

02:32:24
<transcript>: Play game.

02:32:24
<transcript>: we're just gonna

02:32:25
<transcript>: We're just gonna get a bad score.

02:32:25
<transcript>: well i'm gonna get

02:32:28
<transcript>: Well, I'm gonna get one right, and I'm just gonna mess them all up.

02:32:34
<transcript>: I don't know. I'm just gonna hit the first one on everyone, so we'll get some right on accident.

02:32:34
<transcript>: what are you used to

02:32:39
<transcript>: What are you used to display? Your keypresses keycaster screen is frozen.

02:32:41
<transcript>: Keeps doing this.

02:32:43
<transcript>: Keeps doing it.

02:32:46
<transcript>: Really? No. I.

02:32:55
andreull: fine on my end

02:32:57
<transcript>: 've had a couple streams where it does this, but then I'll go several strange where it doesn't, so I don't. It's not a consistent issue, and it OBS. Okay, rank.

02:32:57
<transcript>: ra

02:33:07
<transcript>: Rank. Finally, let's look at the result from finalize result data. Nothing. We got nothing back. Okay, great. Because I got a pee. We'll look at that in a second.

02:33:17
otifex: were you seeing the last edits @andreull ?

02:33:41
jador: is he doing the api on pages/api and front on app/ ?

02:37:21
<transcript>: I'm using TRPC, so there is an API route for TRPC and then the front end. I'm using the Pages directory, so I have I'm using the XJS 13.

02:37:21
<transcript>: haven't opted

02:37:23
<transcript>: Haven't opted into.

02:37:23
<transcript>: the

02:37:29
<transcript>: The App directory yet although I might once we start building like leaderboard pages and user pages, maybe it makes sense.

02:37:29
<transcript>: think for the

02:37:31
<transcript>: Think for the follow Emory.

02:37:31
<transcript>: ci

02:37:33
<transcript>: Cik.

02:37:33
<transcript>: emory sick

02:37:34
<transcript>: Emory, sick.

02:37:34
<transcript>: thanks so much for

02:37:37
<transcript>: Thanks so much for that. Follow and let's get back to it.

02:37:45
<transcript>: Thanks for the following door.

02:37:48
<transcript>: Okay. So what happened here.

02:37:50
<transcript>: Why.

02:37:50
<transcript>: why

02:37:51
<transcript>: Why.

02:37:51
<transcript>: no data

02:37:53
<transcript>: No data.

02:37:53
<transcript>: also

02:37:54
<transcript>: Also.

02:37:54
<transcript>: what

02:37:56
<transcript>: What's the error.

02:37:56
<transcript>: oh

02:37:58
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, yeah, right.

02:38:02
<transcript>: We'll just say.

02:38:07
<transcript>: We're gonna finalize with that data, and now there's gonna be a new error, right.

02:38:09
<transcript>: Oh, maybe not.

02:38:10
<transcript>: Rank.

02:38:13
<transcript>: Is not a number.

02:38:16
<transcript>: It's a finalized.

02:38:21
<transcript>: I don't know I'm making stuff up finalize.

02:38:26
<transcript>: Now what did that do.

02:38:29
<transcript>: On Finalize A rank event data.

02:38:32
<transcript>: You sure that's not okay.

02:38:32
<transcript>: i'm pretty sure

02:38:33
<transcript>: I'm pretty sure I just shaped.

02:38:36
<transcript>: On An Annie.

02:38:43
<transcript>: That's not an any. I do. I need to somehow type this. Let's see right overturn rank.

02:38:46
<transcript>: Oh? Finalized? Yeah? Yeah.

02:38:50
<transcript>: Is that okay.

02:38:56
<transcript>: That's not Typed? I guess. I don't know.

02:38:58
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:39:00
<transcript>: So kind.

02:39:00
<transcript>: we're

02:39:04
<transcript>: We're just gonna remove that for now. I just want to look at the payloads coming out.

02:39:08
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow Zerk.

02:39:11
<transcript>: Btub.

02:39:14
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:39:20
<transcript>: We're gonna do a new game. We're gonna maybe I should put some output.

02:39:24
<transcript>: In let's like logs and stuff.

02:39:30
<transcript>: Where did this go wrong? Potentially it's not rank return in the array.

02:39:33
<transcript>: We gone wrong there.

02:39:33
<transcript>: or we should

02:39:35
<transcript>: Or we should say, if.

02:39:40
cowfacedude99: the logo looks cool

02:39:42
<transcript>: Rank.

02:39:44
<transcript>: What.

02:39:48
<transcript>: I did a lot of restarting my LSP lately.

02:39:49
zerkbtw: whats the game?

02:39:53
<transcript>: Is it really in any we don't know what that is.

02:39:54
<transcript>: We did.

02:39:54
<transcript>: a rev ra

02:39:58
cowfacedude99: !awguess

02:39:59
fossabot: awguess is a guessing game where you're given an AWS service icon and you have to choose the correct service! https://github.com/adamelmore/awguess

02:39:59
<transcript>: A Rev rank. It worked earlier if range.

02:40:02
<transcript>: Equals undefined.

02:40:02
<transcript>: it

02:40:05
parcodek: What IDE is that?

02:40:06
<transcript>: It could be zero, and I don't want to screw that up.

02:40:09
<transcript>: The rank is number one.

02:40:09
<transcript>: so if

02:40:11
<transcript>: So if it's null.

02:40:13
cowfacedude99: neovim

02:40:16
<transcript>: Frank is null return in if the array otherwise.

02:40:16
<transcript>: let's see

02:40:18
<transcript>: Let's see otherwise.

02:40:20
<transcript>: Range.

02:40:23
<transcript>: This. Let's log this stuff.

02:40:28
<transcript>: Rank index.

02:40:28
<transcript>: first

02:40:30
<transcript>: First Rank scores.

02:40:33
<transcript>: Console, log.

02:40:33
<transcript>: scores

02:40:33
parcodek: Oh, damn

02:40:35
<transcript>: Scores.

02:40:35
<transcript>: and then

02:40:37
<transcript>: And then the leaderboard.

02:40:41
parcodek: but how do you exit it?

02:40:43
<transcript>: Let's just log all that stuff.

02:40:46
<transcript>: Let's play another game.

02:40:50
<transcript>: How you exit it.

02:40:54
<transcript>: 's Funny. What's the game? It's. Aw, guess.

02:40:54
<transcript>: the logo

02:40:54
cowfacedude99: I use ZZ LUL

02:41:05
<transcript>: The logo looks cool. You like the logo logo? I don't know. I try to make it clear that it's like you pronounce it. Aw. Guess so. If you see that it's like not AWS at AWS, it's AW. Guess.

02:41:05
<transcript>: so i scratched out

02:41:07
<transcript>: So I scratched out the s. I don't know.

02:41:13
<transcript>: I should get a score. I should get something. I don't know what this one is, though. Opsworks. Yes.

02:41:20
<transcript>: I don't know what this one needs either. Wow, these are hard Fleetwise. There's. Like a steering wheel. Like a fleet.

02:41:20
<transcript>: inspect

02:41:22
<transcript>: Inspector.

02:41:30
<transcript>: Okay, now I'm just gonna start getting them wrong. That might actually be right. That's right. I'm just gonna choose the first one until we get done with this.

02:41:33
<transcript>: That's actually right now.

02:41:36
<transcript>: Okay.

02:41:36
<transcript>: so here

02:41:40
<transcript>: So here we should have logged about empty arrays. Cool.

02:41:43
<transcript>: Why the.

02:41:48
<transcript>: Range was empty.

02:41:55
<transcript>: And then scores also empty. Makes sense. If there's no range, why is this empty.

02:41:55
wuelnerdotexe: I use ZQ

02:41:57
<transcript>: Oh.

02:41:57
<transcript>: score

02:41:59
<transcript>: Scores should be.

02:41:59
<transcript>: sc

02:42:01
<transcript>: Scored, not score.

02:42:04
<transcript>: That's the problem.

02:42:16
<transcript>: Okay. That should just work now. Right.

02:42:20
<transcript>: Should this work? Let's see.

02:42:20
<transcript>: nimble studio

02:42:24
<transcript>: Nimble studio I'm just gonna choose first one trying to go fast.

02:42:29
<transcript>: We got score of one should be pretty low on the leaderboard.

02:42:33
<transcript>: Oh, we got a two an accident.

02:42:36
<transcript>: Why does the first one have to be the right one.

02:42:45
<transcript>: Okay, three.

02:42:45
<transcript>: two

02:42:47
<transcript>: Two, one.

02:42:51
<transcript>: And here's our leaderboard. Hey, look, it worked.

02:42:53
<transcript>: It worked.

02:42:53
<transcript>: so first we

02:42:56
<transcript>: So first we got back.

02:42:59
<transcript>: Oh. Okay. So that should be the.

02:42:59
<transcript>: plus three minus

02:43:01
cowfacedude99: I think lsp restarts when you do :e instead of :LspRestart

02:43:01
<transcript>: Plus three minus three surrounding it.

02:43:16
<transcript>: And then here are our scores that wasn't too slow of a query either. So 153 is the high score, then six and two, then ten. I guess I need to say this.

02:43:16
<transcript>: like maybe

02:43:19
<transcript>: Like maybe we flag the one that.

02:43:19
<transcript>: there's

02:43:22
<transcript>: There's rank one. Rank two. Rank three.

02:43:22
<transcript>: rank four and

02:43:28
<transcript>: Rank four, and rank five. We should flag the one that you currently got.

02:43:28
<transcript>: as being

02:43:29
<transcript>: As being.

02:43:29
<transcript>: like

02:43:32
<transcript>: Like current or something. Maybe.

02:43:39
<transcript>: Just do it on the front end. We know if the ID of the game.

02:43:39
<transcript>: is equal

02:43:42
<transcript>: Is equal to the current ID. Right.

02:43:42
<transcript>: so

02:43:46
<transcript>: So let's visualize this thing. Let's visualize it.

02:43:47
<transcript>: Index.

02:43:54
<transcript>: So here we're going to put, like, a scoreboard below the score. And it's going to be.

02:43:57
<transcript>: Okay. Rufus.

02:43:59
<transcript>: I'm done through this today.

02:44:08
<transcript>: Lfp restarts when you do E instead of LSP restart. Oh, really, I can just do E and it'll restart it.

02:44:21
<transcript>: I think for the follow Echo freshman.

02:44:27
<transcript>: So we want to display this leaderboard. It's kind of like a table.

02:44:31
<transcript>: Kind of.

02:44:43
<transcript>: Mr. Burke, inspiration.

02:44:48
cowfacedude99: it reloads the file into the buffer. so it should

02:44:50
<transcript>: Okay.

02:44:55
<transcript>: So we could just have a little like.

02:44:55
<transcript>: background

02:44:59
<transcript>: Background color bubbles around it. That's the easiest thing, I think.

02:45:12
<transcript>: And then just ranks running down like that. Oh, they have to tie. I guess some of them could be a tie.

02:45:12
<transcript>: oh

02:45:14
<transcript>: Oh.

02:45:21
<transcript>: How's that work.

02:45:21
<transcript>: if they have

02:45:23
<transcript>: If they have the same score.

02:45:29
<transcript>: Like do any of these have Sims core for.

02:45:29
<transcript>: two

02:45:34
<transcript>: Two. Yeah. So these two are the same score. Score. Score for no, no, that's a two.

02:45:39
<transcript>: Okay, I need to get one with the exact same score.

02:45:41
<transcript>: Let's score a ten real quick and see how this works.

02:45:45
ako_freshman: Hi1

02:45:47
<transcript>: Or we'll score six.

02:45:57
<transcript>: Forget one more ride. I think I get a six. Right.

02:46:02
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. Now we just sit here.

02:46:02
<transcript>: we

02:46:04
<transcript>: We make sure we get all wrong now.

02:46:08
<transcript>: Gotta be careful.

02:46:20
<transcript>: Okay. So there's our six.

02:46:25
<transcript>: Should have logged all this output.

02:46:25
<transcript>: oh

02:46:27
<transcript>: Oh, what did it do.

02:46:29
<transcript>: What just happened.

02:46:31
<transcript>: That's not right.

02:46:35
<transcript>: Did I break something.

02:46:43
<transcript>: Let's look at the result.

02:46:50
<transcript>: So our thing to work.

02:46:53
<transcript>: Why didn't it work.

02:46:58
<transcript>: Did I break something.

02:46:58
<transcript>: it's possible

02:47:00
<transcript>: It's possible.

02:47:00
<transcript>: scores

02:47:01
<transcript>: Scores.

02:47:03
grasp5533: hello

02:47:04
<transcript>: Streaks.

02:47:04
<transcript>: up fast

02:47:07
<transcript>: Up fast. What happened here.

02:47:09
<transcript>: Look at our data in upstach.

02:47:13
<transcript>: Data browser. Yeah.

02:47:18
<transcript>: So here's scores in here. Streaks.

02:47:21
<transcript>: Oh, interesting. That's zeroes.

02:47:33
<transcript>: It reloads the file under the buffer. Okay, cool. Hi, Echo, freshman. Hi, there.

02:47:33
<transcript>: grass is

02:47:34
<transcript>: Grass is here.

02:47:52
<transcript>: So we got my matching score.

02:47:56
<transcript>: But for some reason this code did not work.

02:47:56
<transcript>: and it started

02:47:58
<transcript>: And it started right off the bat.

02:48:01
<transcript>: The Rev rank did not get.

02:48:09
<transcript>: This Rev rank.

02:48:15
<transcript>: Only gave us back one ID.

02:48:16
<transcript>: Why.

02:48:17
ako_freshman: next js is same as react but for backed?

02:48:22
<transcript>: No, no. The Rev range. Right here.

02:48:35
<transcript>: We should do that.

02:48:45
<transcript>: I'll seek it's breaking.

02:48:49
<transcript>: The Eastern Cup as it didn't work.

02:48:52
cowfacedude99: @ako_freshman it is a backend framework with react instead of the html forms.

02:48:57
<transcript>: Next is same as React, but for backend. Yeah, it's a meta framework. It's a React meta framework. So.

02:48:57
<transcript>: it's like

02:49:02
<transcript>: It's like you're using Rack, but you want to have kind of more of a full spec solution.

02:49:05
<transcript>: Just got some back end stuff.

02:49:10
wuelnerdotexe: @ako_freshman nop, is a React framework, for Front-End...

02:49:12
<transcript>: I'm specifically using the T three stack, which is like TrpC.

02:49:17
<transcript>: Typescript. I don't remember what the T stand for tailwind.

02:49:29
cowfacedude99: at least that is how theo describes it

02:49:29
<transcript>: Okay.

02:49:32
<transcript>: This is strange to me.

02:49:39
<transcript>: So say the rank would have come back and been and then it would have been what.

02:49:43
<transcript>: I didn't log it, but we can guess.

02:49:43
<transcript>: if i got

02:49:45
<transcript>: If I got a tin.

02:49:45
<transcript>: it would

02:49:48
<transcript>: It would have been tied for second, right.

02:49:53
wuelnerdotexe: Nest.js is a framework for Node.js Back-End...

02:49:56
<transcript>: But I don't know.

02:49:59
<transcript>: Let's actually do again that we're logging.

02:50:05
<transcript>: Let's do it again.

02:50:08
<transcript>: Do it again. We won't get a six again.

02:50:11
<transcript>: I don't know what this is.

02:50:17
<transcript>: Make sense. It would be transcribed.

02:50:22
<transcript>: Don't know what this is either. Shoot.

02:50:26
<transcript>: It's gonna be hard to get a six if I don't know the answers. Oh, there we go.

02:50:28
<transcript>: Need an easy one.

02:50:28
<transcript>: cost

02:50:32
<transcript>: Cost Explorer. Okay, that'll get us six. And then we just wait.

02:50:45
<transcript>: A back end. Very work with react.

02:50:45
<transcript>: instead

02:50:47
<transcript>: Instead of the HTML forms.

02:50:47
<transcript>: that's an interesting way anything

02:50:49
<transcript>: That's an interesting way. Anything about it.

02:50:51
<transcript>: I guess so.

02:50:55
<transcript>: Rank.

02:50:55
<transcript>: two

02:50:56
<transcript>: Two.

02:51:00
<transcript>: And then this time it didn't return anything.

02:51:03
<transcript>: What's going on.

02:51:07
<transcript>: Can we see like is there like a log.

02:51:07
<transcript>: request

02:51:08
<transcript>: Request here.

02:51:13
<transcript>: No.

02:51:27
grasp5533: Adam, are you gonna live tweet AWS?

02:51:29
<transcript>: I'm not sure what's going on here.

02:51:29
<transcript>: so let's

02:51:31
<transcript>: So let's refresh this.

02:51:33
grasp5533: reinvent*

02:51:37
<transcript>: How do we refresh this? There should be a third six now. Oh, here we go.

02:51:41
<transcript>: So we've got these three, six scores.

02:51:47
<transcript>: Let's try and do with the CLI? Let's try and do like.

02:51:51
<transcript>: Can I just start doing commands like Z.

02:51:55
<transcript>: Rev Range scores.

02:51:59
<transcript>: Two Dragon.

02:52:02
<transcript>: Or minus one.

02:52:04
<transcript>: Oh, it went into negative.

02:52:07
<transcript>: Is that what happened.

02:52:11
<transcript>: I think that's what happened. And then that would have been five.

02:52:14
<transcript>: So what if I did.

02:52:16
<transcript>: Zero, five.

02:52:16
<transcript>: yeah that

02:52:24
<transcript>: Yeah. That's what happened. It went into negative. So it started from the bottom of the list. Yeah, yeah. Okay. I just got an absolute value that.

02:52:27
<transcript>: 's okay, so here.

02:52:31
<transcript>: This should be math absolute.

02:52:40
<transcript>: Or no, no, not absolute, no, it should be math. Max.

02:52:40
<transcript>: we should

02:52:44
<transcript>: We should do rank minus three and zero. It shouldn't go.

02:52:44
<transcript>: right

02:52:46
<transcript>: Right above zero.

02:52:50
<transcript>: Like we'll go less than zero.

02:52:56
<transcript>: So we choose zero at the moment. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

02:52:56
<transcript>: i should fix that

02:52:57
<transcript>: I should fix that.

02:52:59
<transcript>: Should fix it. Let's try it again.

02:53:03
<transcript>: Let's get yet another six.

02:53:03
<transcript>: ap

02:53:05
<transcript>: Apache Kafka.

02:53:08
<transcript>: Snowmobile.

02:53:08
<transcript>: okay

02:53:23
<transcript>: Okay, so while we're waiting for this game to expire, we're gonna talk about Snowmobile because it's the most bizarre. Like this is a thing you can order. It's an AWS service. Okay, I got my six Snowmobile. They will ship a semi truck to your house.

02:53:23
<transcript>: or where

02:53:38
<transcript>: Or wherever your business, I guess. And you can load data onto this semitruck petabytes of data and they will then take it back and load it into the nearest data center into S three. So if you have so much data like on premise or something.

02:53:38
<transcript>: that you

02:53:47
<transcript>: That you can't reliably transfer it over the Internet, and it's so much data you can't even use one of the Snowball devices, which is a little briefcase they send you.

02:53:47
<transcript>: they will ship

02:53:54
<transcript>: They will ship a semitruck to you, and you will upload your data physically into that semitruck, and it will ship it back to S three.

02:53:54
<transcript>: bananas

02:53:58
<transcript>: Bananas, that's crazy. It's craziness.

02:53:58
<transcript>: are you

02:53:59
rudixworld: Hey

02:54:01
<transcript>: Are you gonna live? Tweet AWS reinvent maybe.

02:54:01
<transcript>: i'm gonna be

02:54:07
<transcript>: I'm gonna be there. Ridicx is here. Yeah, I'm definitely gonna be there. So we'll see if I want a live tweet some of that.

02:54:09
<transcript>: Okay.

02:54:09
<transcript>: let's see

02:54:13
<transcript>: Let's see there we go now we got rely on.

02:54:13
<transcript>: ranking

02:54:19
<transcript>: Ranking. But now we got to think about the ranks. So this one had a score of 153.

02:54:19
<transcript>: score

02:54:21
<transcript>: Score six, but then.

02:54:21
<transcript>: we need to go

02:54:23
<transcript>: We need to go down here. Where? There's? Right.

02:54:26
<transcript>: Here we go so Rank 153.

02:54:26
<transcript>: square ten

02:54:31
rudixworld: does the answers are completely random

02:54:44
<transcript>: Square ten was a rank two. And then six. Rank three. We kind of need to tie these right. How do we don't want to do that? Like rank three, four, and five. All have a score of six. So those should all just say, rank three, right. And then we jump straight to rank six.

02:54:46
<transcript>: How could we do that efficiently.

02:54:51
<transcript>: How could we do that efficiently, Redis.

02:54:56
<transcript>: Redis the Z does. The answers are completely random.

02:55:06
<transcript>: The questions are completely random. And then, yeah, the options that you have are completely random. We could make it harder by always choosing to have at least one other service from that family of services.

02:55:06
<transcript>: that would make it

02:55:08
<transcript>: That would make it harder.

02:55:10
<transcript>: Quite a bit harder.

02:55:10
<transcript>: but

02:55:14
<transcript>: But it also kind of give you a tell that it's like between one of these two.

02:55:17
<transcript>: Redis, sorted set.

02:55:19
<transcript>: Ties.

02:55:31
<transcript>: So what we could do.

02:55:34
<transcript>: We do this the ugly way.

02:55:37
<transcript>: I will just do it the ugly way.

02:55:37
<transcript>: so

02:55:38
<transcript>: So.

02:55:38
<transcript>: if i can't think

02:55:42
rudixworld: yeah AI'ing it somehow by similarity would be nice

02:55:44
<transcript>: If I can't think of a downside basically when we set the rank I'm going to delete all this logging.

02:55:44
<transcript>: and this

02:55:46
<transcript>: And this stuff.

02:55:54
<transcript>: Okay.

02:56:00
<transcript>: So here, when we set the rank, we could only increase.

02:56:05
<transcript>: We could not increment it if it's the same as the last score. You know, I'm saying.

02:56:07
<transcript>: So score.

02:56:11
<transcript>: How would I do that? I would say.

02:56:18
<transcript>: Feels hacky but previous.

02:56:18
<transcript>: equals

02:56:20
<transcript>: Equals scores find.

02:56:32
<transcript>: I got to get the previous game ID. Don't I.

02:56:38
<transcript>: Equals range.

02:56:45
<transcript>: Minus one.

02:56:49
<transcript>: Right.

02:56:52
<transcript>: And then.

02:56:52
<transcript>: it could

02:56:53
<transcript>: It could be.

02:56:53
<transcript>: unfind

02:56:58
<transcript>: Unfind yeah? So previous equals.

02:57:06
<transcript>: Sid equals previous game ID. Okay, so now we have this previous score.

02:57:11
<transcript>: Or previous game.

02:57:15
<transcript>: And so we would say, rank.

02:57:15
<transcript>: is

02:57:17
<transcript>: Is.

02:57:20
<transcript>: So so hacky.

02:57:20
<transcript>: previous

02:57:21
<transcript>: Previous.

02:57:24
<transcript>: And previous.

02:57:25
<transcript>: previously

02:57:26
<transcript>: Previously.

02:57:47
oskrm: this is gettin out of hands LUL

02:57:50
<transcript>: This would be.

02:57:52
<transcript>: Previous.

02:57:57
<transcript>: Wait. No, it's the rank I'm interested in. What's this.

02:58:00
<transcript>: This is possibly in defined.

02:58:04
<transcript>: How could I be in the find.

02:58:08
<transcript>: If we don't find one here.

02:58:08
<transcript>: i guess

02:58:10
<transcript>: I guess that's right.

02:58:20
<transcript>: But wait a minute, let's think about this previous if there's previous and previous score is equal to the current score so they were tie.

02:58:20
<transcript>: then we

02:58:23
<transcript>: Then we want the previous rank.

02:58:25
<transcript>: How do I know the previous rank.

02:58:28
oskrm: score.find || 0

02:58:37
<transcript>: How do I know the previous rank? It's this right here. I need to figure out.

02:58:46
ako_freshman: games logic are tricky

02:58:49
<transcript>: So first rank plus index plus one.

02:58:52
<transcript>: It would be.

02:58:56
<transcript>: Ha.

02:58:56
<transcript>: we'll

02:58:58
<transcript>: We'll just have to keep track of it.

02:59:00
<transcript>: I think.

02:59:00
<transcript>: think that's what we're gonna do

02:59:03
<transcript>: Think that's what we're gonna do, Const.

02:59:03
<transcript>: current

02:59:04
<transcript>: Current.

02:59:04
<transcript>: rank

02:59:05
<transcript>: Rank.

02:59:08
<transcript>: Equals first range.

02:59:10
<transcript>: I'm not Const.

02:59:13
<transcript>: constant

02:59:13
<transcript>: constant and

02:59:15
<transcript>: Constant. And then we're gonna say, Right here.

02:59:18
<transcript>: Let.

02:59:23
<transcript>: Current range equals first rank.

02:59:26
<transcript>: Plus Index plus one.

02:59:33
<transcript>: Only if.

02:59:40
<transcript>: So that's only going to be if.

02:59:45
<transcript>: Previous.

02:59:48
<transcript>: And Previous statscore.

02:59:52
<transcript>: This is a tie. Right.

02:59:52
<transcript>: let's just

02:59:55
<transcript>: Let's just say it's. Comp, tie.

03:00:03
<transcript>: That's.

03:00:03
<transcript>: tie

03:00:05
<transcript>: Tie if not a tie.

03:00:12
<transcript>: What was that.

03:00:16
oskrm: !so @Delvoid

03:00:21
<transcript>: Del Void Raid There's a rain Double it is rating welcome Devil did friends.

03:00:21
<transcript>: aims log

03:00:23
<transcript>: Aims logic are tricky. They really are.

03:00:23
<transcript>: this is getting out of

03:00:26
<transcript>: This is getting out of hands scored up fine or zero.

03:00:34
<transcript>: Aiing it somehow by similarity would be nice. Yeah, we could Rux. We know what category each of them is in.

03:00:36
<transcript>: Shout out to dolville.

03:00:36
<transcript>: welcome

03:00:38
<transcript>: Welcome, Del Void. Oh, can I do that.

03:00:38
<transcript>: shout out

03:00:40
<transcript>: Shout out del, void.

03:00:41
delvoid: Heyo buddy

03:00:41
adamdotdev: !so @Delvoid

03:00:41
fossabot: Shout out to Delvoid! Go follow them at twitch.tv/delvoid - they were last seen playing Software and Game Development!

03:00:44
<transcript>: Is it not working? There we go.

03:00:52
<transcript>: I wonder if I can give everyone permission to do shoutouts? Is that like a thing you didn't have permission to do or something? Maybe.

03:00:57
<transcript>: Welcome, welcome. What are you up to? Double in.

03:01:00
<transcript>: Alright.

03:01:00
<transcript>: i've seen

03:01:02
<transcript>: I've seen you in a bit have streamed in a bit.

03:01:08
<transcript>: Tie. If not tie, then we want this right.

03:01:08
emerycik: !so @Fossabot

03:01:11
<transcript>: Okay.

03:01:11
<transcript>: and then

03:01:16
<transcript>: And then current rank. This is just gonna be ranked right.

03:01:18
delvoid: Doing great buddy :D How are you

03:01:19
<transcript>: Rank current rank.

03:01:20
<transcript>: Oh.

03:01:25
<transcript>: Like that.

03:01:28
<transcript>: Just like that.

03:01:30
<transcript>: 'll that's.

03:01:30
<transcript>: the ties right

03:01:31
<transcript>: The ties. Right.

03:01:34
<transcript>: So we only increase.

03:01:37
<transcript>: The current let's see current rank.

03:01:41
<transcript>: No, I guess we need to increase the current rank every time.

03:01:42
wuelnerdotexe: Freeze again ?? 🤔

03:01:44
<transcript>: Right.

03:01:44
<transcript>: we just

03:01:46
<transcript>: We just need to.

03:01:46
<transcript>: hear

03:01:48
<transcript>: Hear.

03:01:49
<transcript>: Pi.

03:01:52
<transcript>: Used previous rank.

03:01:54
<transcript>: So let's see.

03:02:00
<transcript>: Previous rank equals current rank before we increment it right.

03:02:03
<transcript>: This is getting out of hand.

03:02:07
cmjio: not seeing your typing

03:02:09
<transcript>: This is getting out of hand, but I think it's gonna work. Let's just try it.

03:02:12
<transcript>: Whoo.

03:02:12
<transcript>: right

03:02:13
<transcript>: Right.

03:02:13
<transcript>: not seeing

03:02:15
<transcript>: Not seeing my typing.

03:02:15
<transcript>: did it again well

03:02:16
oskrm: yep froze

03:02:18
<transcript>: Did it again. Well, at least you didn't miss.

03:02:23
<transcript>: Any tick too exciting. It keeps freezing. I don't know. My OBS hates me today.

03:02:29
<transcript>: So sorry about that. But there it should be fixed now.

03:02:30
joao_colussi: tips for who wants to start to use neovim?

03:02:31
cmjio: Afternoon byy the way

03:02:32
<transcript>: Emory. Welcome to chat.

03:02:32
<transcript>: shout out

03:02:34
<transcript>: Shout out fascibot.

03:02:39
<transcript>: Doing great. I'm doing great. I am. I'm doing good. Doubled.

03:02:39
<transcript>: not senior

03:02:44
<transcript>: Not senior. Typing. Yep. First, I'm chat. Welcome to Chat. Joa.

03:02:47
<transcript>: Tips for who wants to start to use neoveim.

03:02:52
<transcript>: Good afternoon. Sorry. Cmj. Not good. Did I say good morning.

03:03:00
<transcript>: Tips for who wants to start using new of them so think for the follow Tsalia. I would say.

03:03:00
<transcript>: i would use

03:03:03
cmjio: No :) i just joined the stream :)

03:03:04
<transcript>: I would use neoveim if you're like intros it in.

03:03:05
wuelnerdotexe: @joao_colussi install Enfocado Theme, ok no xd

03:03:09
<transcript>: Oh, afternoon, by the way.

03:03:11
<transcript>: Welcome to.

03:03:11
<transcript>: i'm gonna

03:03:13
<transcript>: I'm gonna use it if you're like.

03:03:13
<transcript>: interested

03:03:31
<transcript>: Interested in having a new hobby. I would not use it if like your only goal is to like improve productivity. I would just add Vimbiting Vin bindings to whatever Editors. If you use Vs. Code, I would probably just add the binding to Vs. Code. If your ultimate goal is I want to move faster and you're not using them already.

03:03:31
<transcript>: neovem is

03:03:45
<transcript>: Neovem is great, though. If you really just like, you want to spice things up. I've loved having kind of a new hobby and like tinkering with my editor has become a really fun thing. So in terms of starting, where do you start? Oh, I didn't tie. Yeah, I did. I got a ten.

03:03:47
oskrm: dont listen to adam Kappa just go full nvim, start slow

03:03:50
<transcript>: Chris at Machine had a bunch of videos, I think early in my stream when we were learning.

03:03:50
<transcript>: just go

03:03:53
lilfreezi: vim is better if u are kinda restricted on ram

03:03:55
<transcript>: Just go. Fold in them. Just start slow. There you go. Don't listen to me.

03:03:58
<transcript>: So now we should have a rank that is.

03:04:03
<transcript>: Tied should have ties in this result.

03:04:03
<transcript>: here we go

03:04:06
<transcript>: Here we go. Do we have ties.

03:04:13
<transcript>: Rank 153. Rank 210. Also rank two.

03:04:13
<transcript>: pin

03:04:16
<transcript>: Pin Rank four.

03:04:16
<transcript>: correct

03:04:17
<transcript>: Correct.

03:04:22
<transcript>: So it skips. Rank three, right.

03:04:28
<transcript>: And that's the score of six. And then this next one should also be.

03:04:28
<transcript>: rank

03:04:30
<transcript>: Rank four.

03:04:30
<transcript>: square six

03:04:33
<transcript>: Square six. Yeah, it works. It's kind of ugly, but it works.

03:04:33
<transcript>: i'm

03:04:38
<transcript>: I'm not a huge fan of how I did that. Okay. So now we need to visualize it, right.

03:04:43
<transcript>: So now we can actually go back to our index and visualize.

03:04:46
<transcript>: Did I store that on the I stored it on the.

03:04:46
<transcript>: on the context

03:04:47
<transcript>: On the context. Right.

03:04:50
<transcript>: Like console.

03:04:50
<transcript>: or just like

03:04:53
<transcript>: Or just like JSON stringify.

03:04:56
<transcript>: New contacts.

03:04:56
<transcript>: lead

03:04:59
<transcript>: Leaderboard? Is that what I call it.

03:05:03
<transcript>: Context. Finalize.

03:05:06
texoport: Vim/nvim used to be a lot more accessible to beginners during the CoC days imo (as far as being able to configure it yourself without using something like lunarvim).

03:05:07
<transcript>: To do that. There it is.

03:05:07
<transcript>: okay

03:05:08
oskrm: @adamdotdev when are you adding telemetry and savin user data in DB to sell them for companies to recruit aws expert Kappa

03:05:10
<transcript>: Okay. That's probably not how we want to visualize it.

03:05:17
<transcript>: Vim is better if you're kind of restricted on Ram.

03:05:17
<transcript>: vm neil them

03:05:25
<transcript>: Vm. Neil Them used to be a lot more accessible to beginners during the COC days, in my opinion, as far as being able to configure it yourself without using something like Lynn or vim.

03:05:25
<transcript>: thank you for

03:05:28
<transcript>: Thank you for the file. Justin Spencer.

03:05:36
<transcript>: When are you adding telemetry and saving user data in database to sell them? For companies to recruit AWS experts.

03:05:36
<transcript>: that's funny

03:05:37
<transcript>: That's funny.

03:05:37
<transcript>: i think this game

03:05:40
<transcript>: I think this game will be a good way to judge people's.

03:05:42
<transcript>: Aws expertise.

03:05:47
<transcript>: So what I actually want to render is.

03:05:47
<transcript>: i don't want to do like a

03:05:56
<transcript>: I don't want to do, like, a table. Oh, yeah. We started to look at some examples here. We could just do these little, like, let's just do these just kind of like, list items. They're gonna have little, like.

03:05:56
<transcript>: gray borders

03:05:57
<transcript>: Gray borders.

03:05:58
wuelnerdotexe: Also, I have another Vim plugin for sensible defaults, and other friendly tools, It's called human.vim in case it helps anyone \0/

03:05:59
<transcript>: Which are nice.

03:06:02
<transcript>: And they're gonna have a number.

03:06:05
<transcript>: So a rank.

03:06:09
<transcript>: Navatar there's.

03:06:13
<transcript>: Name, and then the score. Okay.

03:06:13
<transcript>: let's just do that

03:06:15
<transcript>: Let's just do that. Just like that.

03:06:19
<transcript>: So I want to do.

03:06:22
<transcript>: A ul, I guess.

03:06:25
<transcript>: Ul.

03:06:25
<transcript>: if you

03:06:27
<transcript>: If you will.

03:06:31
<transcript>: And we're gonna say, leaderboard.

03:06:31
<transcript>: context

03:06:32
<transcript>: Context.

03:06:36
<transcript>: Map.

03:06:39
<transcript>: For.

03:06:48
<transcript>: You.

03:06:49
oskrm: a feature to add, after a failed guess you could open a modal to show info about the service

03:06:52
<transcript>: Store ID.

03:06:58
<transcript>: Okay.

03:06:58
<transcript>: let's put

03:06:59
<transcript>: Let's put.

03:07:02
<transcript>: Forward users.

03:07:10
<transcript>: Get something on there you know.

03:07:17
<transcript>: Sorry. Okay. So I've got all the high schools. It turns out I'm the only one that plays the game, so make sense.

03:07:19
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:07:19
<transcript>: it's

03:07:22
<transcript>: It's actually going to be a grid.

03:07:24
<transcript>: Class name.

03:07:24
<transcript>: grid

03:07:25
<transcript>: Grid. I think.

03:07:28
ako_freshman: you are doing mobile first?

03:07:29
<transcript>: Grid calls.

03:07:31
<transcript>: We just want to do.

03:07:36
<transcript>: A grid flow, column.

03:07:39
<transcript>: That I want.

03:07:39
<transcript>: like

03:07:42
<transcript>: Like Gap or something.

03:07:45
<transcript>: And we'll just put some, like, DIVS in here.

03:07:45
<transcript>: so div

03:07:46
<transcript>: So Div.

03:07:57
<transcript>: Rank. Okay.

03:08:03
<transcript>: Then we'll do score dot, username.

03:08:03
<transcript>: and

03:08:06
<transcript>: And we'll do score, dot.

03:08:13
<transcript>: Like this.

03:08:13
<transcript>: oh that's

03:08:17
<transcript>: Oh, that's not good. Do we want grid flow.

03:08:20
<transcript>: Row, green.

03:08:23
<transcript>: Flow, row.

03:08:27
<transcript>: How do you do? Grids. Someone help me out.

03:08:27
<transcript>: grid

03:08:29
<transcript>: Grid.

03:08:31
<transcript>: We're trying to sue flex.

03:08:32
rydeenxrising: dont you have toadd grid

03:08:34
<transcript>: How did you see flex.

03:08:38
<transcript>: Flex.

03:08:39
ako_freshman: grid template column?

03:08:41
<transcript>: I want like consistent spacing.

03:08:44
<transcript>: Grid, template, column.

03:08:46
<transcript>: Feature to add let's see.

03:08:54
ako_freshman: repeat(auto , 4 fr)

03:09:03
<transcript>: Feature to add. After failed guests, you could open a modal to show info about the service. I asked a good point. You could learn. I'm gonna have, like, a page for every game where you can kind of like, see the ones you got right and the ones you got wrong. And we could do stuff like that there maybe.

03:09:03
<transcript>: i'm doing

03:09:12
<transcript>: I'm doing mobile first. Yeah. I'm just like making the whole thing mobile only. Basically, like, it's just gonna look like a mobile app on your desktop as well. I think.

03:09:12
<transcript>: don't

03:09:13
<transcript>: Don't have to do.

03:09:13
<transcript>: grid

03:09:19
<transcript>: Grid grid template column repeat auto for but they're all gonna be different sizes.

03:09:24
<transcript>: You know what? I want this whole thing to be like a grid, actually. So this.

03:09:27
<transcript>: Is gonna be a grid.

03:09:27
<transcript>: not gonna use

03:09:29
<transcript>: Not gonna use a ul.

03:09:29
<transcript>: so this is

03:09:31
<transcript>: So this is gonna be a grid.

03:09:33
<transcript>: These are just gonna be DIVS.

03:09:43
<transcript>: And then these are no. These are gonna be like different grid rows. Each of these. Right.

03:09:46
<transcript>: I don't want to do that.

03:09:54
<transcript>: I want the columns to be the same width, right.

03:10:00
<transcript>: I could say fixed with. But that sounds. That sounds bad.

03:10:05
<transcript>: Let's see, tailwind.

03:10:06
<transcript>: Grid.

03:10:08
<transcript>: Autoflow.

03:10:26
<transcript>: Grid, grid, grid.

03:10:32
<transcript>: Grid, auto, columns.

03:10:33
oskrm: grid-rows-3

03:10:36
<transcript>: Grid, template, columns.

03:10:39
<transcript>: That's at their uniform. Right.

03:10:39
<transcript>: why can't i

03:10:42
<transcript>: Why can't I ever remember this template? Rows.

03:10:49
<transcript>: Okay. So we can have SPAN's.

03:10:49
<transcript>: just

03:10:50
oskrm: or grid-cols-3

03:10:52
<transcript>: Just grid auto float is do what I want.

03:10:58
<transcript>: Grid. Rows three. Or grid calls. Three. Okay.

03:10:58
<transcript>: i don't know how many

03:11:01
<transcript>: I don't know how many rows. I do know how many calls.

03:11:01
<transcript>: how many

03:11:03
<transcript>: How Many columns.

03:11:06
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow Kylie.

03:11:10
<transcript>: So let's see these.

03:11:10
<transcript>: each

03:11:12
oskrm: just do grid grid-cols-3

03:11:13
<transcript>: Each row is going to be.

03:11:13
<transcript>: some

03:11:16
<transcript>: Some Div, right. But maybe I need to make this a fragment.

03:11:26
<transcript>: Right.

03:11:26
<transcript>: let's

03:11:28
<transcript>: Let's have a key.

03:11:28
<transcript>: oh

03:11:29
<transcript>: Oh.

03:11:38
<transcript>: Look at this. Then we said, grid, grid, grid.

03:11:38
<transcript>: calls

03:11:42
<transcript>: Calls three like that.

03:11:44
<transcript>: Okay. Now we're getting somewhere.

03:11:47
<transcript>: Thanks so much for this Oscar.

03:11:50
<transcript>: Saving me some time.

03:11:50
<transcript>: okay

03:11:57
<transcript>: Okay, grid. We can't get my auto layout to my window manager's. Not working.

03:11:59
<transcript>: So.

03:12:05
<transcript>: We're going to.

03:12:18
cowfacedude99: you don't have https://github.com/windwp/nvim-ts-autotag?

03:12:22
<transcript>: Do as a fragment. I guess these should all have DIVS around them because I gotta like stop style this thing, right? But how will I keep the columns.

03:12:28
<transcript>: You don't have invents auto tag. I guess not. Cafes. I thought I used to, but it just hasn't been working.

03:12:28
<transcript>: so maybe i did

03:12:31
<transcript>: So maybe I did this one. I want this to be a Div.

03:12:31
<transcript>: and then

03:12:34
<transcript>: And then it's gonna have a class name.

03:12:37
<transcript>: Something like.

03:12:37
<transcript>: back

03:12:38
<transcript>: Background.

03:12:38
<transcript>: or sorry

03:12:41
<transcript>: Or sorry? Bg.

03:12:44
<transcript>: Will say Blue, five.

03:12:47
<transcript>: And rounded.

03:12:49
<transcript>: Through XL. I don't know.

03:12:52
<transcript>: That's awful.

03:12:52
<transcript>: we'll get there

03:12:54
<transcript>: We'll get there, we'll get there.

03:12:57
<transcript>: So.

03:12:57
<transcript>: let's see

03:12:59
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:13:02
<transcript>: Like this is a row of my column, right.

03:13:02
<transcript>: from my

03:13:06
<transcript>: From my grid, but I want the columns.

03:13:06
<transcript>: i do this

03:13:09
<transcript>: I do this. You know, I'm saying, like, this should be one row.

03:13:14
<transcript>: This Div should be a row in this grid.

03:13:17
oskrm: this is a cell

03:13:32
<transcript>: How do I. How do I do that without, like, flexing this. I want consistent. This is a cell. Each of these things is a cell, right? These three. These are all spells. This should be one row and the grid is up here. Is that a thing you can do? Or am I thinking about this wrong.

03:13:32
<transcript>: is

03:13:35
<transcript>: Is it actually something else? Is it a table.

03:13:38
<transcript>: Maybe I supposed to use a table here.

03:13:42
<transcript>: A table makes more sense, actually, doesn't it.

03:13:47
<transcript>: But do you not use tables anymore? Is that not a thing people do.

03:13:51
robcil: d--flex flex column?

03:13:56
cowfacedude99: you need to do the setup()

03:13:56
<transcript>: Table layout like I could actually use table and all this right.

03:14:00
<transcript>: You need to do this setup.

03:14:00
<transcript>: oh

03:14:04
<transcript>: Oh my not doing Mvmts auto tag setup. Is that the problem.

03:14:14
<transcript>: You're saying I actually have the plugin listed.

03:14:18
<transcript>: In here.

03:14:18
<transcript>: auto

03:14:21
<transcript>: Auto tag, what's it called.

03:14:21
<transcript>: auto

03:14:22
<transcript>: Auto.

03:14:24
<transcript>: Sure, I have it.

03:14:31
<transcript>: I don't think I have it. Auto payers? Is that it.

03:14:37
<transcript>: Auto payers.

03:14:44
<transcript>: Auto Payers. I think that's it is that it.

03:14:53
<transcript>: Auto, pays.

03:14:53
<transcript>: it's configured

03:14:55
<transcript>: It's configured right here.

03:14:59
<transcript>: What did I do? Did I break it.

03:15:01
oskrm: require('nvim-ts-autotag').setup()

03:15:09
<transcript>: My MMTS auto tag setup. I don't think I've even installed auto tag.

03:15:13
<transcript>: But with I used Auto Payers instead. Is that supposed to be the same thing.

03:15:13
<transcript>: you know

03:15:15
<transcript>: You know campus.

03:15:17
<transcript>: I'm gonna go back.

03:15:17
<transcript>: while

03:15:23
<transcript>: While you all are ruminating on that, so don't use the table. I think I'm gonna use a table. I think this is just a table.

03:15:27
<transcript>: Think so.

03:15:27
<transcript>: and

03:15:29
<transcript>: And then this is a row.

03:15:33
<transcript>: Tr.

03:15:35
<transcript>: tright

03:15:35
wuelnerdotexe: Or also, `autotag = enable` in the treesitter setup...

03:15:36
<transcript>: Tright.

03:15:39
<transcript>: So this is not gonna be grid.

03:15:41
<transcript>: It's gonna be table.

03:15:41
<transcript>: aut

03:15:43
<transcript>: Auto.

03:15:43
<transcript>: stuff like

03:15:44
cowfacedude99: autopairs is different. autopairs is for creating pairs. autotag is for changing tags on the fly

03:15:45
<transcript>: Stuff like that.

03:15:50
<transcript>: And then these are all not DIVS. These are.

03:15:52
<transcript>: Tc.

03:15:55
robcil: th

03:15:55
<transcript>: I don't even know HTML.

03:15:57
<transcript>: Td.

03:16:00
<transcript>: So these are TDs.

03:16:08
cowfacedude99: I am slow today due to dactyl. :(

03:16:10
<transcript>: That works.

03:16:13
<transcript>: In there.

03:16:13
<transcript>: we

03:16:15
<transcript>: We want to say.

03:16:15
<transcript>: let's see

03:16:17
<transcript>: Let's see. This is going to be.

03:16:24
<transcript>: With full.

03:16:28
<transcript>: No. What's wrong with this.

03:16:28
<transcript>: with

03:16:30
<transcript>: With full.

03:16:35
<transcript>: I find out stressing to the full width of the.

03:16:42
<transcript>: Auto pairs is different out of pairs is for creating.

03:16:42
<transcript>: pa

03:16:46
<transcript>: Pairs Auto tag is for changing Tags on the fly.

03:16:48
<transcript>: Okay.

03:16:50
oskrm: you could now do even:bg-blue-500 odd:bg-blue-100 on tr className

03:16:52
<transcript>: Or auto tag enabled in the tree sitter setup.

03:16:55
<transcript>: Is it just a plugin of tree sitter.

03:17:01
<transcript>: Ooh, Oscar, we can do even an odd colors that's cool.

03:17:01
<transcript>: i like that

03:17:02
<transcript>: I like that.

03:17:03
oskrm: to get striped tables

03:17:08
<transcript>: But first I gotta figure out why can't I make these stretch to the full width of the screen.

03:17:12
<transcript>: Let's see the width of this thing.

03:17:17
<transcript>: Justify Center oh, we're justified center here.

03:17:27
<transcript>: I don't do that. Everything's gonna be like, not centered, I guess. No. Still centered.

03:17:28
<transcript>: Text Center.

03:17:37
<transcript>: Okay, let's inspect this thing.

03:17:41
<transcript>: So here we have our.

03:17:43
<transcript>: Main.

03:17:43
<transcript>: here's

03:17:46
<transcript>: Here's. This Div.

03:17:52
<transcript>: That's absolutely positioned. So this one right here.

03:17:54
oskrm: change table-auto to table-fixed

03:17:58
<transcript>: Is not taking up the full width. Is it because it selects call.

03:17:58
<transcript>: select column

03:17:59
<transcript>: Select column.

03:17:59
<transcript>: is that why

03:18:00
<transcript>: Is that why.

03:18:03
<transcript>: Where is it? Because this parent.

03:18:03
<transcript>: flex

03:18:10
<transcript>: Flex flex item center, justify center. Okay, so this one I need to maybe not.

03:18:15
<transcript>: Maybe not do that.

03:18:21
<transcript>: Justified center. Let's try this.

03:18:24
<transcript>: That's for the height.

03:18:27
<transcript>: What about Items? Center.

03:18:31
<transcript>: Here we go.

03:18:31
<transcript>: i didn't need to do that

03:18:32
<transcript>: I didn't need to do that.

03:18:33
<transcript>: Okay.

03:18:38
<transcript>: If I remove that and now I can go full width on those things.

03:18:49
<transcript>: So we have with I don't need to do that.

03:18:52
<transcript>: I do need to do that.

03:18:54
<transcript>: Okay.

03:18:54
<transcript>: then

03:18:56
<transcript>: Then let's say.

03:18:58
<transcript>: These.

03:18:58
<transcript>: needleid

03:19:00
<transcript>: Needleids full.

03:19:08
<transcript>: Okay, these are ours taking up a full width. So two XL that didn't work ramp, rounded, didn't work.

03:19:12
<transcript>: Why not actually.

03:19:15
<transcript>: Can I not round the.

03:19:17
<transcript>: Let's do.

03:19:17
<transcript>: space

03:19:19
<transcript>: Space.

03:19:19
<transcript>: y two

03:19:25
<transcript>: Y two. Does that work in a table? I don't know. Now how do you space out a table? It's probably in here somewhere.

03:19:28
<transcript>: Tight table, fixed.

03:19:30
<transcript>: Not one thing.

03:19:46
<transcript>: Layout, Border spacing.

03:19:52
<transcript>: Between Table boarders.

03:19:53
<transcript>: What.

03:19:57
<transcript>: Does that control what I think it controls like these.

03:20:00
<transcript>: Order. Separate.

03:20:00
<transcript>: border

03:20:02
<transcript>: Border spacing.

03:20:07
<transcript>: I don't know. Should I not be using a table? Is this just a bad idea in 2022? Me by now.

03:20:07
<transcript>: change table

03:20:10
<transcript>: Change table auto to table fixed.

03:20:15
<transcript>: Why would I want a fixed table versus an auto table? I'm not actually sure.

03:20:20
<transcript>: I do want to do border spacing.

03:20:27
<transcript>: Order. Separate.

03:20:32
<transcript>: It's not what I wanted.

03:20:34
<transcript>: But.

03:20:43
<transcript>: I feel like I could do this with grid if I knew what I was doing.

03:20:44
oskrm: yep do it on one axis only

03:20:48
<transcript>: I don't have like a tea head on this. Maybe I could put column headers.

03:20:54
<transcript>: Change table auto to table to do on one axis only.

03:20:57
<transcript>: So you're saying instead of table auto, I should do.

03:20:57
<transcript>: table

03:20:59
<transcript>: Table six.

03:21:07
<transcript>: What did that do? That made them all the same. I don't want them all the same, though.

03:21:22
<transcript>: I don't want to do this visually. That is I thought I'd just have, like, a little.

03:21:22
<transcript>: border

03:21:25
oskrm: i meant the border-spacing accepts an axis

03:21:29
<transcript>: Border all around the whole thing. I guess I'll add a T head here and let's see what that looks like. Tee head.

03:21:31
<transcript>: I know how to do it here.

03:21:36
<transcript>: What do you add to a tee head? You add.

03:21:39
<transcript>: T what.

03:21:43
<transcript>: T head. You had a Tr.

03:21:48
<transcript>: And then.

03:21:48
<transcript>: ph

03:21:50
<transcript>: Ph.

03:21:50
oskrm: like border-spacing-y-2

03:21:52
cruncharoo: border-spacing-y-2

03:21:53
<transcript>: phoenix

03:21:54
<transcript>: Phoenix.

03:21:59
<transcript>: Rank.

03:22:05
<transcript>: And then.

03:22:06
<transcript>: User.

03:22:10
<transcript>: Score.

03:22:18
<transcript>: Let's do more of a.

03:22:24
<transcript>: More of Spacing between all this. Oh, wait, that's not actually.

03:22:28
<transcript>: We need to do.

03:22:35
<transcript>: Space, wide.

03:22:44
<transcript>: And Luki stir. That's really weird.

03:22:44
<transcript>: let's just

03:22:47
<transcript>: Let's just yank this whole tag.

03:22:47
<transcript>: out

03:22:49
<transcript>: Out and put it right here.

03:22:52
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

03:23:03
<transcript>: Border spacing. Y two. Oh, gotcha. Yeah, do it on the one axis. Only. Cool. That's what I want. Yeah. Border spacing.

03:23:03
<transcript>: thank you so much

03:23:07
<transcript>: Thank you so much. Welcome to Chat, Crunch, arou.

03:23:09
<transcript>: arouacing y

03:23:09
<transcript>: arouacing y two that's

03:23:12
<transcript>: Arouacing y two. That's what I'm looking for. Now, can I not.

03:23:18
<transcript>: Rounded on these.

03:23:27
<transcript>: Get round those. Oh, wait. That's the whole table. I don't want to do that.

03:23:27
<transcript>: i want to do it

03:23:31
<transcript>: I want to do it on these. Oh, I'm already doing it. Yeah. So that's not working.

03:23:45
<transcript>: Let's do some padding.

03:23:52
<transcript>: Oh, padding doesn't work either.

03:23:56
<transcript>: Why wouldn't panning work.

03:24:04
<transcript>: I know nothing about tables. So.

03:24:04
<transcript>: feel

03:24:07
<transcript>: Feels like I'm gonna be first in pain.

03:24:12
<transcript>: Class name. I guess I can do it here.

03:24:15
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:24:15
<transcript>: interesting

03:24:16
<transcript>: Interesting.

03:24:27
<transcript>: Somebody tell me, just somebody tell me would you do this with the table, or would you use a grid? Am I gonna wish I hadn't done a table.

03:24:31
<transcript>: It feels more semantically correct.

03:24:31
<transcript>: oh it did not

03:24:36
<transcript>: Oh, it did not my table auto. It's not doing the.

03:24:39
<transcript>: They're all the same with now, aren't they, again.

03:24:43
<transcript>: Where did that? Where did that break down.

03:24:46
<transcript>: In my tee head that I scrub with the tea head.

03:24:49
<transcript>: No.

03:24:53
<transcript>: Table Auto with full.

03:24:57
<transcript>: Order separate border y one spacing wire.

03:25:11
<transcript>: I guess we should say this whole table. We would only show if we have a finalized.

03:25:13
<transcript>: Score.

03:25:16
<transcript>: We're gonna highlight.

03:25:20
<transcript>: So one thing we're gonna do.

03:25:23
<transcript>: Is like this.

03:25:27
<transcript>: We're gonna say.

03:25:30
<transcript>: I guess we're just gonna say, like.

03:25:34
<transcript>: Score ID equals.

03:25:39
<transcript>: Contact game.

03:25:41
<transcript>: Id.

03:25:51
<transcript>: If it's the current game, we're gonna say, background, blue, five or six.

03:25:51
<transcript>: there's our current

03:25:57
<transcript>: There's our current score. We'll visually will change that, but that just helps me kind of start seeing.

03:26:00
wuelnerdotexe: Guys, I say goodbye, I'm going to watch the Mexico 🇲🇽 game in the World Cup CoolCat

03:26:00
<transcript>: I don't know why the the columns now.

03:26:03
<transcript>: Seem like they're all the same size.

03:26:03
<transcript>: because i

03:26:06
<transcript>: Because I added a T head.

03:26:15
oskrm: add w-full on player name?

03:26:19
<transcript>: Now they're still like that. Yeah.

03:26:19
<transcript>: i'm going to

03:26:26
<transcript>: I'm going to watch the Mexico game the World Cup. Enjoy Walner Add with full on player name.

03:26:26
<transcript>: okay

03:26:28
<transcript>: Okay, play your name.

03:26:29
<transcript>: Here.

03:26:37
<transcript>: Interesting.

03:26:40
<transcript>: Do these all need to have the same path padding.

03:26:51
<transcript>: It was it when I added this.

03:26:56
<transcript>: Was it when I added this.

03:27:05
<transcript>: They're still wrong.

03:27:11
<transcript>: Something.

03:27:16
<transcript>: About this tile. This table thing is bothering me.

03:27:20
nand0tech: it's a table every column is same width by default is it not

03:27:21
<transcript>: But I also don't know how I would do it with the grid. So.

03:27:29
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Nando Tech. It's a table. Every column is same width by default. Is it not.

03:27:29
<transcript>: well i

03:27:32
<transcript>: Well, I thought this table auto. Here.

03:27:35
<transcript>: I thought this table, auto.

03:27:40
<transcript>: Meant that it would let's see.

03:27:46
<transcript>: Table Auto. Can you not do boarder spacing with Table auto.

03:27:49
<transcript>: What's border collapse.

03:27:56
<transcript>: Border Collapse Combine adjacent cell borders into a single border when possible.

03:28:05
<transcript>: I don't understand that, but let's look at table out again. Table, auto.

03:28:16
<transcript>: To allow a table to automatically size columns to fit the contents of the cell. Is it because the contents aren't too big? So just like defaults to this layout. Maybe.

03:28:18
cruncharoo: "You can manually set the widths for some columns and the rest of the available width will be divided evenly amongst the columns without explicit width."

03:28:19
<transcript>: Like if we added.

03:28:19
<transcript>: if

03:28:21
<transcript>: If we added this.

03:28:30
<transcript>: Now it takes up more space. So it's just that the user the names aren't too big.

03:28:33
<transcript>: Do I want those T heads.

03:28:33
<transcript>: center

03:28:38
<transcript>: Centered. Or probably not. Probably. Let's see, how can I do this.

03:28:40
cruncharoo: that's from tailwind

03:28:43
<transcript>: Text left. Does that work.

03:28:47
cowfacedude99: making something look nice is the hardest part LUL

03:28:48
<transcript>: Yes, but not great. I guess I need to do it on the whole table.

03:28:51
<transcript>: Maybe.

03:28:53
nand0tech: @Cruncharoo this is really just like a HTML thing not even tailwind specific i think

03:28:55
<transcript>: Yeah, but we need some padding.

03:28:58
<transcript>: Oh, but I don't.

03:28:58
<transcript>: i

03:29:04
<transcript>: I guess I don't want some of them left. Alonic, the score should be centered. That looks better.

03:29:09
<transcript>: Yeah. This is just a it's just a HTML thing.

03:29:09
<transcript>: making

03:29:10
oskrm: it's time to go back to grid LUL

03:29:12
<transcript>: Making something look nice is the hardest part. That's right.

03:29:22
<transcript>: It's time to go back to grid. Let's see you can manually set the width for some columns and the rest of the available width will be divided evenly amongst the columns without explicit width.

03:29:23
zirus16: that looks good!

03:29:27
<transcript>: I think we're pretty close to a decent looking.

03:29:29
<transcript>: Peterboard. Here.

03:29:33
<transcript>: Like this is an awful.

03:29:33
<transcript>: we need to put

03:29:37
<transcript>: We need to put the avatar in there. Let's just go and do that.

03:29:42
<transcript>: So TD, we're gonna say class name.

03:29:42
<transcript>: flex

03:29:43
<transcript>: Flex.

03:29:45
<transcript>: Spacex.

03:29:49
<transcript>: Maybe like that. And then we're gonna add.

03:29:49
nand0tech: I'm more accustomed to boostrap where i'd just set them with "col-md-2" or whatever

03:29:53
<transcript>: An image.

03:29:55
<transcript>: Source.

03:30:00
<transcript>: Source is Score, user.

03:30:02
<transcript>: Image.

03:30:08
<transcript>: Is Score User name.

03:30:11
<transcript>: Like this.

03:30:21
<transcript>: Whoa, Hello, sweetie. Is set the width? What's wrong with source? Here.

03:30:21
<transcript>: oh

03:30:25
<transcript>: Oh, it cuz it could be on the phone, so we're gonna say.

03:30:30
<transcript>: Let's see. This. Y is a tag.

03:30:30
<transcript>: oh not that

03:30:32
<transcript>: Oh, not that tag, this tag.

03:30:46
<transcript>: We're gonna say Score, dot, user.

03:30:50
<transcript>: Okay. And then we can say here.

03:30:50
<transcript>: that's not like

03:30:52
<transcript>: That's not like that.

03:31:00
<transcript>: 'd be good. Now let's wrote that type string or null. So you're saying this could still be oh, okay. So user.

03:31:00
<transcript>: and sc

03:31:04
<transcript>: And score, user.

03:31:04
<transcript>: image

03:31:07
<transcript>: Image? Actually no, just.

03:31:12
<transcript>: Not image.

03:31:16
cowfacedude99: obs is not on best behavior today LUL

03:31:21
<transcript>: Name can be null, I guess. Okay.

03:31:24
deenr: did it freeze or am i going crazy

03:31:35
cowfacedude99: ^

03:31:35
<transcript>: Another.

03:31:37
zirus16: freeze or he is coding in his mind

03:31:45
oskrm: yeah froze again

03:31:46
<transcript>: Man. Dude, it's jumping me to, like, way up in the buffer. And I don't like that cow face. What's going on? Fix it. Just kidding.

03:31:46
<transcript>: but do you

03:31:50
deenr: @zirus16 maybe both :)

03:31:50
<transcript>: But do you know, why would it do that every time I hit undo it like jumpsuit to the top of the buffer.

03:31:57
<transcript>: Obs is not my best behavior today. Did it get stuck again? Is it frozen.

03:32:00
<transcript>: Stupid OBS.

03:32:01
<transcript>: obscats me

03:32:01
<transcript>: obscats me today

03:32:02
<transcript>: Obscats me today.

03:32:11
<transcript>: All right.

03:32:11
<transcript>: fix

03:32:12
<transcript>: Fixed it.

03:32:12
<transcript>: so

03:32:17
<transcript>: So the there's our image. But we're gonna say we're gonna say a width.

03:32:21
<transcript>: We're gonna say class name.

03:32:24
<transcript>: Width, five.

03:32:29
<transcript>: With five height, five.

03:32:29
<transcript>: are they always

03:32:31
<transcript>: Are they always squares.

03:32:38
alfww: For rounded corners you need to do it as custom css. And use :first-child and :last-child with the border radius

03:32:40
<transcript>: Eight. We're going to make it rounded.

03:32:48
<transcript>: I think for the follow Yeeld meat pie and Shawshank and Kylie NQ.

03:32:48
<transcript>: i don't know if i

03:32:50
<transcript>: I don't know if I saw those.

03:32:50
<transcript>: did it

03:32:55
<transcript>: Did it freeze. Where am I going? Crazy. Welcome to Chat Deener. You are not going crazy. It froze.

03:32:55
<transcript>: maybe

03:33:06
<transcript>: Maybe both for round of corners. You need to do it as a custom CSS and use first child and last child with the border radius. Tables are awful. That's what I just took from that. Tables are bad.

03:33:09
<transcript>: That's my takeaway.

03:33:09
<transcript>: so

03:33:10
zirus16: why you need the avatar? i dont see it.

03:33:13
<transcript>: So we can't say on this one. We can't say.

03:33:18
<transcript>: Like what happens if I do P two. Here.

03:33:22
<transcript>: So that I do now, that's not what I want.

03:33:29
<transcript>: Css is bothering me.

03:33:29
<transcript>: i don't like

03:33:30
<transcript>: I don't like it.

03:33:36
<transcript>: So this one we need to do items. Center.

03:33:38
rydeenxrising: atleast using table you gonna support IE6 as well Kappa

03:33:41
<transcript>: Spacex is not working.

03:33:41
<transcript>: why is it not working

03:33:42
alfww: Yep, html tables are annoying x)

03:33:45
<transcript>: Why is it not working in a flex? Why can't I do SpaceX.

03:33:47
<transcript>: My kid. I do that.

03:33:52
<transcript>: Are you not working.

03:33:55
nand0tech: @RydeenxRising LUL

03:33:58
<transcript>: Html tables are annoying agreed at least using table you're gonna support Ie six.

03:34:01
<transcript>: Why you need the avatar.

03:34:01
<transcript>: you don't see it

03:34:02
<transcript>: You don't see it.

03:34:07
<transcript>: You don't know why would want to put an avatar on here.

03:34:07
<transcript>: or

03:34:09
<transcript>: Or you don't see the avatar.

03:34:13
<transcript>: I think having the Avatar is nice.

03:34:13
<transcript>: personally

03:34:14
<transcript>: Personally.

03:34:16
<transcript>: So.

03:34:23
<transcript>: It's annoying when it's just my face over and over because there's no other players of the game right now.

03:34:26
zirus16: if you like it, do it.

03:34:27
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:34:27
<transcript>: because

03:34:32
<transcript>: Because they fix height on the roads.

03:34:35
<transcript>: Oh, I should use the class name.

03:34:43
<transcript>: Pmpm and class names.

03:34:59
<transcript>: I think for the Follow, Reagan and chindler.

03:35:01
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:35:03
<transcript>: We're gonna say.

03:35:03
<transcript>: right here

03:35:07
<transcript>: Right here. Import class names.

03:35:07
<transcript>: from

03:35:08
<transcript>: From.

03:35:10
<transcript>: Last names.

03:35:22
<transcript>: Already have it. You tell me I already had it.

03:35:25
<transcript>: The whole time.

03:35:25
<transcript>: already had it

03:35:26
<transcript>: Already had it.

03:35:26
<transcript>: okay so

03:35:29
<transcript>: Okay. So then this is gonna become class name.

03:35:29
<transcript>: and

03:35:31
<transcript>: And then.

03:35:36
<transcript>: Background Blue Six is going to be.

03:35:40
<transcript>: Store ID.

03:35:40
<transcript>: equals

03:35:43
<transcript>: Equals context game ID.

03:35:48
<transcript>: And then Background Blue for.

03:35:50
<transcript>: Is going to be.

03:35:50
<transcript>: score

03:35:55
<transcript>: Score ID. And does not equal context. That game ID.

03:35:58
<transcript>: Then this is going away.

03:36:03
<transcript>: Okay. And then we can add some more classes here. Like.

03:36:06
<transcript>: We're gonna make height a fixed height.

03:36:11
<transcript>: Is that a good height? No.

03:36:17
<transcript>: Okay. That's a pretty good height. I think.

03:36:17
<transcript>: so

03:36:22
<transcript>: So a height of ten. And now we can do some fixed layout stuff. So like.

03:36:25
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:36:33
<transcript>: Can we do items center if it's not a flex layout, if it's a table layout. No.

03:36:39
<transcript>: We cannot, but we can do let's see.

03:36:39
<transcript>: we could

03:36:44
<transcript>: We could say this whole thing is like Heightful. Maybe.

03:36:51
<transcript>: And then if we do Flex Item Center now didn't work.

03:37:00
<transcript>: This kind of sucks. Working with tables. You know, I'm saying not enjoying it.

03:37:02
<transcript>: Not enjoying it.

03:37:32
<transcript>: We'll have a link for like view the full leaderboard, maybe at the bottom and then we'll have a leaderboard page. So to show the top, I guess we'll have to paginate that I got a lot to do. Its time is moving too quickly.

03:37:32
<transcript>: we are running

03:37:35
<transcript>: We are running out of time.

03:37:39
<transcript>: Running out of time.

03:37:49
<transcript>: How can I make this look good with the table.

03:37:52
<transcript>: Or should I just use a grid.

03:37:59
<transcript>: I mean, the rounded corners thing wasn't a big deal. I don't really care about that.

03:38:00
rudixworld: use flex

03:38:02
<transcript>: But I do care about.

03:38:09
<transcript>: Making this look nice. So if the row itself has a full height.

03:38:09
<transcript>: and then i say

03:38:13
<transcript>: And then I say, this, this has a full height. Then can I say.

03:38:16
<transcript>: Items Center.

03:38:18
<transcript>: Now the Flex, just like isn't worth.

03:38:18
<transcript>: the table

03:38:21
<transcript>: The table. I don't know why.

03:38:21
<transcript>: doesn't

03:38:26
<transcript>: Doesn't really make sense to me, but I don't really use tables so I don't know.

03:38:26
<transcript>: i thought

03:38:28
<transcript>: I thought I could just have like.

03:38:33
<transcript>: I need to have a Div inside of this. Maybe I need to have a Div inside of this.

03:38:33
<transcript>: yeah

03:38:34
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:38:41
<transcript>: Maybe.

03:38:48
<transcript>: Okay. And then I can put all these class names.

03:38:53
nand0tech: wait there's libraries you can use on TOP of tailwind too? (I haven't been doing web dev past cpl years lol) https://flowbite.com/docs/components/tables/

03:38:54
rudixworld: div fled > div w-[fixed] div grow > div fixed

03:38:59
<transcript>: App.

03:39:02
<transcript>: And then I'm gonna delete.

03:39:08
<transcript>: Like this.

03:39:10
rudixworld: not sure what's the idea tho

03:39:16
<transcript>: Does that even need to say hike for.

03:39:22
<transcript>: So this can be flex item Center.

03:39:22
<transcript>: spacex

03:39:24
<transcript>: Spacex is still not working.

03:39:28
<transcript>: There's libraries you can use on top of tail. And two I have been doing.

03:39:28
<transcript>: web dev past couple

03:39:30

<transcript>: What voice assistant? Was that.

03:39:46
<transcript>: oh that was my

03:39:49
<transcript>: Oh, that was my. That was my watch.

03:40:17
<transcript>: With fit.

03:40:17
<transcript>: not

03:40:22
nand0tech: looks like it's just a bunch of helpers on top of tailwind that let you do a bunch of fancy stuff (not sure I would use it necessarily was just interesting)

03:40:24
<transcript>: Not sure what's the idea. I mean, this is basically the layout I want. I'm trying to side if I even like this. The column headers up here.

03:40:26
<transcript>: I don't think I like the way they're aligned.

03:40:27
<transcript>: and

03:40:33
<transcript>: And I don't like how little control I seem to have overlayout. Like, why can't I do SpaceX between these two.

03:40:38
<transcript>: Things. Is it because this isn't a tag? Maybe I need to add a tag.

03:40:43
<transcript>: Let's do.

03:40:47
<transcript>: What kind of add a tag.

03:40:55
rudixworld: use ml/r instead

03:40:58
rudixworld: same result

03:40:58
<transcript>: That's gonna work.

03:40:58
<transcript>: and does i even need

03:41:01
<transcript>: And does I even need to be a Div? I guess it could have been like.

03:41:03
<transcript>: And maybe.

03:41:10
<transcript>: Use marginal left right instead. Same result.

03:41:12
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:41:14
<transcript>: I guess that would have been.

03:41:18
<transcript>: This is looking. Okay? I don't love the column headers.

03:41:21
<transcript>: That's too much space.

03:41:33
<transcript>: So rank one.

03:41:45
<transcript>: What's wrong with this? There's something wrong with it. I don't know what it is. Should the should this be said.

03:41:48
<transcript>: So like.

03:41:52
<transcript>: Justifies center maybe.

03:41:58
<transcript>: That's okay. Yeah. That's looking better.

03:42:01
<transcript>: How's this looking.

03:42:06
<transcript>: The Avatar can maybe be a little smaller.

03:42:13
<transcript>: Like that.

03:42:13
<transcript>: score

03:42:18
<transcript>: Score user okay, it's good enough. It's good. I can't get hung up on too much of the details here.

03:42:18
<transcript>: we got a lot to build

03:42:21
<transcript>: We got a lot to build so it shows your current score.

03:42:23
nand0tech: ngl that flowbite library demos some really nice tables LUL LUL

03:42:24
<transcript>: Like the one you just got.

03:42:34
<transcript>: That.

03:42:34
<transcript>: i feel

03:42:36
nand0tech: but yeah not worth

03:42:36
<transcript>: I feel about that.

03:42:43
<transcript>: Flow by Library demos Some really nice tables. Oh, really.

03:42:43
<transcript>: there

03:42:46
rudixworld: avatars was before Kappa

03:42:48
<transcript>: There's something I should be looking at with flow bite. Let's see.

03:42:53
<transcript>: I mean, I could have gone to like the tailwind UI, tables, stuff.

03:42:56
<transcript>: These are the tables.

03:43:01
<transcript>: I don't think I want to add like a whole, nother dependency.

03:43:01
<transcript>: i will

03:43:04
<transcript>: I will look at tailwind UI and make sure there's no.

03:43:08
<transcript>: Like inspiration. There.

03:43:10
<transcript>: Tables.

03:43:17
<transcript>: I don't know.

03:43:23
<transcript>: I kind of this is just pretty minimal. And it's it's okay. I think it's okay.

03:43:23
<transcript>: so that's

03:43:28
nand0tech: exactly, I don't think it worth adding it on here, but the tables at the bottom were fancy af

03:43:29
<transcript>: So that's your score. What else do I need to add on to this leaderboard? Let's look at some leaderboards.

03:43:35
<transcript>: So I could have their handles.

03:43:35
<transcript>: if

03:43:35
ad4mwood: You basically have to do all your styling shizzle on the cell

03:43:38
<transcript>: If I know their handle, like their Twitter or whatever.

03:43:42
<transcript>: Now I don't think I should just use your name or just their name.

03:43:49
<transcript>: The rank.

03:43:53
<transcript>: So here's one has the points.

03:43:56
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:43:56
<transcript>: that's fine

03:43:57
<transcript>: That's fine.

03:44:00
<transcript>: It's fine.

03:44:05
<transcript>: Oh, the time like when it when it happened should I put when it happened.

03:44:11
<transcript>: Like a date, or is that just gonna clutter this up? It's probably just gonna clutter it up.

03:44:19
<transcript>: Avatars was before.

03:44:27
<transcript>: I don't think it's worth adding it on here, but the tables at the bottom were fancy. Okay.

03:44:38
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Adam Wood. You basically have to do all your styling on the cell. Oh, on each individual cell, you can't style the table. Yeah. We kind of learned that it sucks.

03:44:39
ad4mwood: 👋

03:44:41
<transcript>: Delete to the okay.

03:44:47
<transcript>: Well, that's okay. I think this is good enough. It'll look better when it's not just me.

03:44:51
<transcript>: So you're rank.

03:44:52
ad4mwood: Sorry took me a while to sign up 😂

03:44:56
<transcript>: It shows where you rank and it shows relative. So like if I get a.

03:44:59
<transcript>: We need to go do some more games so I can see.

03:44:59
<transcript>: how

03:45:03
<transcript>: How this will look when we get other scores.

03:45:05
<transcript>: Just do a bad score.

03:45:12
<transcript>: I got it right on accident.

03:45:25
<transcript>: Took me a while to sign up. No worries, Adam. Thanks for signing up.

03:45:29
<transcript>: And welcome to my chat? Welcome to my channel.

03:45:33
<transcript>: Appreciate you showing up. Okay. So that shows.

03:45:41
<transcript>: That's the last score. So showing rank seven, eight, nine, and ten. So it's always gonna show you just kind of relative to, like.

03:45:49
<transcript>: Where you fit on the total leaderboard. It's not showing the whole leaderboard. Should I show the first 1st top score of the thing.

03:45:49
<transcript>: no matter

03:45:57
<transcript>: No matter what your rank so if you're way at the bottom like you got scored number 156, should we always show like the top score.

03:45:57
<transcript>: and then

03:46:02
<transcript>: And then dot, dot, dot, dot all the other's. I think so. Kind of think that'd be nice.

03:46:02
<transcript>: do we think

03:46:03
<transcript>: Do we think that'd be nice.

03:46:08
<transcript>: So as a pinions on that.

03:46:21
<transcript>: Game over. Score one.

03:46:21
<transcript>: here's

03:46:23
<transcript>: Here's your score.

03:46:23
<transcript>: on the

03:46:25
<transcript>: On the leaderboard.

03:46:30
<transcript>: We're gonna have a view the whole Lister board below the table here.

03:46:32
<transcript>: So let's see.

03:46:43
<transcript>: Anchor.

03:46:48
<transcript>: Guess I should use link.

03:46:56
<transcript>: We're using next JS, so we might as well use next JS. You know, I'm plan.

03:46:58
<transcript>: Link.

03:46:58
<transcript>: ahref

03:47:00
<transcript>: Ahref, or is it two.

03:47:07
<transcript>: Href leaderboard.

03:47:16
<transcript>: And it'll be like View, Full leaderboard.

03:47:22
<transcript>: I don't like that. I'm using this font.

03:47:29
<transcript>: Like, I don't like that. Everything's caps. It's kind of getting annoying.

03:47:35
<transcript>: And I feel like I like the font, but I feel like it's locking me into some weird stylistic.

03:47:35
<transcript>: things

03:47:36
rudixworld: do you need to passHref with next 13 for SEO?

03:47:36
<transcript>: Things.

03:47:36
<transcript>: zero

03:47:42
<transcript>: Zero zero cool for things as follow do you need to pass Ahref with next 13 for SEO.

03:47:47
<transcript>: What do you mean? Past Ahref.

03:47:51
<transcript>: Thanks, yes. 13 for SEO.

03:47:58
<transcript>: Pass. Oh, what's this forces linked to send the Href property to its child.

03:48:00
rydeenxrising: ''Inter'' best font lol.

03:48:02
<transcript>: To send the Href property to its child.

03:48:06
<transcript>: What's that mean.

03:48:06
<transcript>: that's if

03:48:10
<transcript>: That's if I added an anchor tag manually or something.

03:48:13
<transcript>: I don't know.

03:48:13
<transcript>: if their best

03:48:15
<transcript>: If their best font.

03:48:15
<transcript>: enters a good

03:48:17
<transcript>: Enters a good font.

03:48:21
<transcript>: Okay view fool leaderboard.

03:48:26
<transcript>: What is this? This is our sign in with Twitter.

03:48:28
<transcript>: We're gonna have other signin options.

03:48:29
rudixworld: it means it would not get rendered in prod

03:48:33
<transcript>: If you're not signed in, so let's sign out.

03:48:33
<transcript>: go figure that

03:48:34
<transcript>: Go figure that flow out.

03:48:42
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow everbrew. It means it would not get rendered in prod.

03:48:45
<transcript>: Not get rendered in prod.

03:48:51
<transcript>: What would not be a render? You're saying if I do pass Ahref.

03:48:57
<transcript>: Is that what you're saying.

03:49:09
<transcript>: We're gonna log out. I don't have a logout button, so we're just clearing site data.

03:49:13
<transcript>: Oh, new games is no longer.

03:49:16
<transcript>: Width constraint.

03:49:23
<transcript>: Slot. Terrible, though. We're gonna make like a whole landing page, and this will just be a button that can take you into the game.

03:49:27
<transcript>: Okay.

03:49:31
<transcript>: I actually don't know what this is.

03:49:34
<transcript>: Ucs Anywhere. Yeah.

03:49:44
<transcript>: No Sumerian. Okay, it's Kinesis State analytics.

03:49:47
rudixworld: yeah this is basically why I switched to Next ... when you view source you see the whole <a href , otherwise its just react thing

03:49:50
<transcript>: What is this? Compute. Optimizer.

03:49:54
<transcript>: Yeah. This is basically why I switched next.

03:49:54
<transcript>: when you view sort

03:49:58
<transcript>: When you view sorts you see the whole Ahref. Otherwise it's just reacting.

03:49:58
<transcript>: oh

03:49:59
<transcript>: Oh.

03:50:03
<transcript>: Pass href is the only way to get it to.

03:50:06
<transcript>: Actually rank an anchor tag.

03:50:12
<transcript>: Sorry. What you're saying? I thought it rendered an anchor tag anyway, but it doesn't.

03:50:12
<transcript>: that's no good

03:50:13
<transcript>: That's no good.

03:50:16
<transcript>: Okay, we're just gonna end it at eleven.

03:50:22
<transcript>: Now, I'm not logged in, so we need to not show the leaderboard. Let's see.

03:50:26
<transcript>: We're gonna make a difference.

03:50:30
<transcript>: On my word.

03:50:30
<transcript>: what just happened

03:50:31
<transcript>: What just happened.

03:50:35
<transcript>: Down.

03:50:40
<transcript>: So here.

03:50:43
<transcript>: This table.

03:50:43
<transcript>: i want to do

03:50:47
<transcript>: I want to do just collapse the table, but I can't do that.

03:50:51
<transcript>: Nope.

03:50:54
<transcript>: We're gonna add a new.

03:50:54
<transcript>: container

03:50:56
<transcript>: Container for this Div.

03:51:00
<transcript>: After the table in the link.

03:51:05
<transcript>: So this whole thing we're gonna say.

03:51:07
<transcript>: This whole thing.

03:51:16
<transcript>: Y? S? A tag.

03:51:19
<transcript>: Let's only be if.

03:51:22
<transcript>: Context.

03:51:26
<transcript>: Finalized.

03:51:34
<transcript>: We should only have a finalized if you're logged in right.

03:51:37
<transcript>: You're not logged in.

03:51:37
<transcript>: we should

03:51:40
<transcript>: We should not. Then the question is.

03:51:40
<transcript>: once you

03:51:42
<transcript>: Once you log in.

03:51:50
<transcript>: I should put this in the state machine. I guess.

03:51:56
<transcript>: We only want to call the finalized service.

03:51:56
<transcript>: let's go up here

03:51:59
<transcript>: Let's go up here. Let's look at our service.

03:52:02
<transcript>: So here.

03:52:02
<transcript>: if

03:52:04
<transcript>: If there's no gain.

03:52:04
<transcript>: here

03:52:09
<transcript>: Here if there's no user ID we don't actually want to call finalized yet.

03:52:15
<transcript>: So how do I want to do that? Do I want to.

03:52:24
<transcript>: I only want to finalize once you've signed in.

03:52:41
<transcript>: What do we think.

03:52:41
<transcript>: i'm trying

03:52:44
<transcript>: I'm trying to side if I want to do this in the.

03:52:52
<transcript>: Week when we transition into Game over, we call finalize.

03:52:59
<transcript>: But if you're not logged in, maybe I should only invoke this service if you're logged in.

03:53:07
<transcript>: Otherwise. Maybe we should transition.

03:53:14
<transcript>: No, not transition. That would be a new state, would it.

03:53:20
<transcript>: So when you do the login, you're gonna get OAuth, redirected.

03:53:20
<transcript>: and it's gonna bounce

03:53:23
<transcript>: And it's gonna bounce you back.

03:53:26
<transcript>: And at that point we're on the game over state.

03:53:26
<transcript>: but we actually have

03:53:29
<transcript>: But we actually have a user ID.

03:53:29
<transcript>: so we would then

03:53:31
<transcript>: So we would then want to.

03:53:31
<transcript>: rerun

03:53:33
<transcript>: Rerun.

03:53:39
<transcript>: Rerun that finalized, and that's not gonna happen the way I've got it set up right now.

03:53:42
<transcript>: How do I want to do this.

03:53:51
<transcript>: So, Rudics, you're saying there won't be an anchor tag? Unless I do passage ref. Let's do this. Next.

03:53:51
<transcript>: link

03:53:52
<transcript>: Link.

03:53:55
<transcript>: Pass, address.

03:53:58
<transcript>: Into my docs.

03:54:03
<transcript>: You thought it's a false.

03:54:12
<transcript>: Custom component that wraps an anchor tag as a child of Link, is a custom component that wraps an anchor tag. You must add past, Ahref.

03:54:17
<transcript>: See, I'm not I'm just gonna let them render the anchor tag, but you're saying they won't.

03:54:24
<transcript>: So Childhood link is a functional component. In addition to using Patref, so, let's wrap the component in forward ref.

03:54:25
rudixworld: odd:bg-transparent even:bg-gray-800 cool thing you can add to lists

03:54:29
<transcript>: Link link can also receive a URL object to automatically format Kris URL string.

03:54:29
<transcript>: oh that's

03:54:31
<transcript>: Oh, that's cool.

03:54:40
<transcript>: Places URL instead of push.

03:54:53
<transcript>: The Nexus 13 middleware. Okay, I think.

03:55:07
<transcript>: Background transparent even back on Gray cool thing you could add to lists.

03:55:09
<transcript>: Does that work on tables.

03:55:09
<transcript>: because we're using a

03:55:11
<transcript>: Because we're using a table.

03:55:30
<transcript>: Like an alternating color. I think I want to not do alternating color simply because one, it's not a big sign, a big table. There's not a lot of cells. So it's not as hard to read, but two, I want to highlight the one that you just scored like you're your score in the entries. And I think if I have an alternating that'll mess with that, maybe a little bit.

03:55:34
<transcript>: Okay. So I'm trying to think how I want to do this.

03:55:36
rudixworld: for sure but it has to be added on the parent tag

03:55:42
rudixworld: not items itself

03:55:49
<transcript>: State here. Like if you in the game, you're in a game overstate, but you're not logged in. It's kind of a different state than if you are logged in. And I wonder if I should actually have some substates on Game over.

03:55:53
<transcript>: We could.

03:56:00
<transcript>: Then the question is when we come back to the page after the after the login, what's going to trigger.

03:56:07
<transcript>: What's going to trigger that service again? Because I don't think it gets triggered. Well, I guess just I should test that.

03:56:09
<transcript>: Finalize.

03:56:11
<transcript>: Oh, Where am I.

03:56:14
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:56:17
rudixworld: localStorage?

03:56:19
<transcript>: Next.

03:56:19
<transcript>: here

03:56:23
<transcript>: Here. Let's just log if this gets run.

03:56:27
<transcript>: I'm just curious if it runs again.

03:56:30
<transcript>: When it comes back from the redirect.

03:56:35
<transcript>: Or just from a page refresh. I guess now.

03:56:35
<transcript>: right

03:56:37
<transcript>: Right not logging.

03:56:37
<transcript>: can

03:56:40
<transcript>: Can you log in here like this.

03:56:48
<transcript>: Let's see. So let's actually play again. And let's see if it does when we come back in.

03:57:08
<transcript>: Okay, game over.

03:57:11
<transcript>: It logged. It right there.

03:57:11
<transcript>: but

03:57:16
carlosgn: !font

03:57:16
fossabot: Adam uses the Dracula theme and the Operator Mono font in VSCode.

03:57:18
<transcript>: But it doesn't log it on a page refresh because we're not entering into the state. We're just we're just restoring the state.

03:57:26
<transcript>: I don't want to do that.

03:57:28
<transcript>: Local storage.

03:57:33
<transcript>: What do you Sandish at? Store rudics.

03:57:36
<transcript>: In local storage.

03:57:44
<transcript>: Right now, I'm restoring the X state.

03:57:46
<transcript>: Initial state.

03:57:52
<transcript>: I think I need to add like a query Parame.

03:57:52
<transcript>: when it forward

03:57:55
<transcript>: When it forwards back to the game.

03:58:09
<transcript>: Okay. I think I'm I need to take a longer break. I think I've fought too long today.

03:58:09
<transcript>: it's close i

03:58:15
<transcript>: It's close. I normally go till ten. Oh, it's 358 perfect. So I've got like two minutes until I've been on here for 4 hours.

03:58:15
<transcript>: so

03:58:19
<transcript>: So I'll talk for two minutes, and then we'll call it a day.

03:58:25
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm getting close. So I really want to launch AW, guests, like, tomorrow. Probably.

03:58:25
<transcript>: just because

03:58:34
<transcript>: Just because I'm gonna probably take Thursday, Friday off, hang out with my family before I leave or reinvent. And I want it to be up there before reinventing. Sound real. Thank you so much.

03:58:34
<transcript>: five months

03:58:36
<transcript>: Five months.

03:58:36
<transcript>: i've been doing

03:58:39
<transcript>: I've been doing this for five months.

03:58:43
<transcript>: I had no idea. Thank you so much for the five months. Hub.

03:58:46
<transcript>: Wow, five months. Is that right.

03:58:46
<transcript>: i thought we were just

03:58:49
<transcript>: I thought we were just into the four months.

03:58:57
<transcript>: But if you've been subscribed for five months, then that means I must have been doing this for five months. Thank you so much again, Sandra, one of the very first.

03:58:57
cowfacedude99: time to raid dax?

03:58:59
<transcript>: The very first supporters of the channel.

03:59:15
<transcript>: Time to read DAX. I was DAX streaming. Yes, it is time to read DAX. It is time to read DAX. I'm trying to talk for one more minute because I'm just OCD, OCPD, and I really want to see the 4 hours take over on my session.

03:59:21
cowfacedude99: what is sst?'

03:59:22
<transcript>: I don't want to end this with 3 hours. 59. I guess it takes like 30 seconds for the outro. So.

03:59:22
<transcript>: yeah

03:59:32
<transcript>: Yeah, it's been fun. What is SST? Sst is serverless stack. It's a. It's built on top. It's kind of built on top of the CDK, but it's just like a way better Dev experience than the season.

03:59:38
