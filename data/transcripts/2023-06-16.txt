12:34:32
<transcript>: I don't have my stream deck plugged in it's in my closet. So I had to make an http request with Carl to hit my api to change the scene, and it worked. I wasn't sure it was going to work. I still know how to do things on a computer. How about that.

12:34:39
<transcript>: Who's here? Who's here? Who's here? This feels so good I can't even explain how good this feels.

12:34:44
mehulsharmamat: 3.5 hrs until adam is gonna disappear again

12:35:08
erdavtyan: checked out your podcast with dax today - awesome stuff :) when will you have guests??

12:35:08
<transcript>: I can't quite get over that.

12:35:09
fragaverage: Yessir, scamming me for a whole year. GG LUL

12:35:15
<transcript>: Has that been a year? Do you know when something like a time event just does not.

12:35:15
<transcript>: seem the

12:35:19
<transcript>: Seem the distance the way it was that does not seem like a year ago.

12:35:23
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the resub. All the streamer.

12:35:23
<transcript>: deeds

12:35:24
thdxr: @erdavtyan can definitely do that have been thinking about it

<transcript>: Deeds. Thank you sock, for the resub four months.

12:35:27
<transcript>: and four months

12:35:28
thdxr: we did one with teej

12:35:33
<transcript>: And four months. I appreciate you guys. I'm going to turn on some music. I have to do it with my fingers.

12:35:33
<transcript>: because

12:35:34
opti_21: oh no he‚Äôs gonna spiral again lol

12:35:40
<transcript>: Because I don't have a stream deck, so hang on. I'm going to go to my old streaming playlist, which I haven't played.

12:35:43
<transcript>: In a month. Here we go.

12:35:44
thdxr: Adam so how about them guns

12:35:47
<transcript>: Is this going to work? Why would this not work.

12:35:50
<transcript>: Maybe.

12:35:53
<transcript>: It works.

12:35:53
<transcript>: this

12:35:55
<transcript>: This is awesome.

12:35:55
<transcript>: okay so

12:35:59
<transcript>: Okay. So I did not intend to take a month off.

12:36:05
<transcript>: For some reason. The last time I streamed roughly a month ago.

12:36:06
opti_21: yea what about junk mail?

12:36:13
<transcript>: It did not occur to me that I was getting ready to embark on a month of planned activities that would make it very hard to stream.

12:36:17
gitreps: Hi üëã first time viewer here

12:36:21
<transcript>: And. Well, okay. So the first couple of weeks would have made it really hard to stream, and then they just threw me out of all my habits, and it was just.

12:36:21
<transcript>: like that

12:36:22
<transcript>: Like that? Was it.

12:36:22
<transcript>: we made

12:36:27
<transcript>: We made a big joke about it being my last dream. Last time. The irony.

12:36:27
<transcript>: that

12:36:32
<transcript>: That I was not going to stream for a while, had no idea.

12:36:37
thdxr: wtf don‚Äôt give adam your prime

12:36:40
<transcript>: So I went on vacation the week after that stream. I say this like, I don't know how many of you were even here for that live stream.

12:36:40
mehulsharmamat: @GitReps you're gonna have to wait a month for the next stream

12:36:40
teej_dv: then he started ranting about guns for two weeks, but forgot to turn the camera on

12:36:42
<transcript>: I went on vacation for a week.

12:36:42
<transcript>: and then

12:36:44
<transcript>: And then I got back.

12:36:44
fragaverage: But you made a conscious effort to pack the stream deck away ü§î

12:36:54
opti_21: veryhaHmm

12:36:55
<transcript>: And I think the next week, my wife went to Florida for a week. No, I don't remember. I think my wife traveled the next week. No.

12:36:55
<transcript>: i traveled

12:36:57
<transcript>: I traveled. It doesn't matter.

12:36:57
<transcript>: i went

12:37:00
<transcript>: I went to a Tech conference, and then.

12:37:00
<transcript>: my

12:37:03
<transcript>: My wife was gone for a while. It was just a lot of different things.

12:37:06
mehulsharmamat: ah yes the usual "my wife"

12:37:11
vimcerf: sipsThink

12:37:12
notorioussledge: @thdxr Had to celebrate his resurrection

12:37:15
<transcript>: Where it's been the strangest month of my life, but in the best possible ways. So that's the weird part. It's like I've been so disconnected from the internet, from all of you, from my friends.

12:37:24
<transcript>: I mean, I've still been around, but just like none of my normal habits, I haven't woken up and made a dandy blend in a month.

12:37:25
gitreps: @mehulsharmamat I‚Äôm starting to realize that lol

12:37:28
opti_21: Florida changed him

12:37:34
<transcript>: I get up at like seven. I normally get up at like four. I've been staying up super late. Getting up late. I don't know if render started that I don't know.

12:37:36
techdufus: We miss your spicy tweets.

12:37:40
vimcerf: @opti_21 too much sunlight

12:37:42
<transcript>: But literally every habit of my days has been completely shattered. I've been working out a ton. I've been going on lots of walks.

12:37:45
<transcript>: I'm probably the healthiest I've been.

12:37:49
<transcript>: I don't know in adulthood and yet.

12:37:52
<transcript>: It's like so different from my.

12:37:59
charafmrah: 7am is late? ._.

12:38:02
<transcript>: Style. A month ago that it feels like unhealthy. I don't know. Does that make sense? Like I'm such a man of habit. Okay. I was talking about who's here. Sorry.

12:38:02
<transcript>: frag

12:38:08
<transcript>: Frag is here. Little freezey. I'll ask a freaking question. How do I get his handsome and brief.

12:38:09
notorioussledge: First time sunburnt and then he starts having a mental breakdown in his own twitter thread

12:38:11
<transcript>: A little freezy.

12:38:11
<transcript>: appreciate

12:38:14
thdxr: ‚Äúhealthiest i‚Äôve ever been and also i‚Äôm having a mental breakdown‚Äù

12:38:16
<transcript>: Appreciate you opti already said that Opdy. I didn't sell all my cameras. No.

12:38:18
<transcript>: Seb is here.

12:38:18
<transcript>: null chef

12:38:20
<transcript>: Null. Chef was here. Mayhew.

12:38:20
<transcript>: oh

12:38:23
<transcript>: Oh, man, this feels so good. Funky.

12:38:23
<transcript>: opti

12:38:31
<transcript>: Opti said something else. Oh, was he going to sleep? Because it was going to take ten minutes. Notorious sledge. Thank you so much for the prime sub.

12:38:31
<transcript>: see

12:38:32
tayloreddev: hello again

12:38:33
<transcript>: See that.

12:38:36
opti_21: I still think it‚Äôs a mix of the good good and a mid life crisis LUL

12:38:39
<transcript>: Prime sub from Notorious ledge Just saying nobody's keeping score.

12:38:39
<transcript>: but we're keep

12:38:46
<transcript>: But we're keeping score. Calface. It's okay. Not a prime sub. That's okay, cowface. Thank you so much. Well, guess.

12:38:46
<transcript>: i

12:38:50
<transcript>: I keep going to ranting about my ROI on your Street.

12:38:53
<transcript>: I'm so sorry.

12:38:59
<transcript>: I guess I've never promised that if you sub to my channel, that means I will continue streaming.

12:38:59
<transcript>: you never know

12:39:07
<transcript>: You never know when I might just dip away for a while. So there's that risk. But risky investments. Those are the ones that have the most upside.

12:39:07
<transcript>: they

12:39:14
<transcript>: They say it's what economists say or something. Economists, financial people, I don't know.

12:39:23
<transcript>: Ayush is here Freedom Day. Ow is here if we wait long enough at AI replaces us.

12:39:31
<transcript>: Sock. Oh, yeah. You resub sock. Grab the popcorn. Yeah. I realized starting the stream today.

12:39:31
<transcript>: i don't know

12:39:37
mehulsharmamat: yep risky investments -> $1 billion dollingos. That's why i gamble

12:39:37
<transcript>: I don't know. A good half of you probably think you're about to watch a man melt down on Twitch.

12:39:37
cowfacedev: well, I am going for monthly one now LUL.

12:39:44
<transcript>: I recognize that yesterday.

12:39:46
teej_dv: that's what i'm here for

12:39:47
dmdboi: Skipped all our messages

12:39:51
<transcript>: Was interesting for me on the podcast on dax's stream.

12:39:53
dmdboi: Classic Adam

12:39:55
cowfacedev: and still waiting for laravel LUL

12:39:57
<transcript>: I don't know. It's the same exact brain chemistry I got going on today. Caffeine. Nothing else.

12:39:57
<transcript>: so

12:40:04
notorioussledge: That's why I only make bets that I know won't win, those have the biggest payouts

12:40:07
<transcript>: So you might get more of that. But maybe it seems more normal on my stream than it did on that. I don't know. Maybe it was just the wrong combination of topics and something, but.

12:40:11
<transcript>: I was on one yesterday. Let's see.

12:40:11
<transcript>: adam

12:40:17
cowfacedev: hi @teej_dv and @thdxr

12:40:24
<transcript>: Adam, can you build an AI? Adam? So I can talk to him about my back end code. Oh, my botched code. Sure. That actually sounds really fun. I think the AI, like avatar stuff is really cool. Diamond is here. Who's this guy? What am I going to notify.

12:40:25
teej_dv: o/

12:40:27
<transcript>: Only has one MacBook.

12:40:30
<transcript>: Nft Scam Won A MacBook.

12:40:30
<transcript>: oh my

12:40:33
<transcript>: Oh, my God, you won.

12:40:33
<transcript>: out

12:40:38
<transcript>: Out of points. Mayhew. Oh, no, I haven't been streaming so nobody can earn points. I'm so sorry.

12:40:41
thdxr: helllo

12:40:42
<transcript>: Got a code of my soy windows machine.

12:40:48
<transcript>: Unruly hot fixers here. Adam takes a break from streaming every now and then, every now and then. It's healthy.

12:40:48
<transcript>: and even

12:41:04
<transcript>: And even today, it's not going to be a super long stream. I'm not going to be like going to my screen because I literally don't have anything set up. I don't have another camera plugged in, so it will just be this just me talking, hanging out, catching up, trying to reintroduce some habits.

12:41:04
<transcript>: literally i woke up

12:41:11
<transcript>: Literally. I woke up this morning, aside from waking up at 07:00 a.m.. Which is super late for me. I tried to do everything else the same way I would.

12:41:11
<transcript>: like a

12:41:16
<transcript>: Like a month ago. So I made my dandy blend. Literally. I haven't drank this.

12:41:16
<transcript>: i

12:41:24
notorioussledge: THAT'S WHY HE STOPPED, HE HAD TO SLOW DOWN THE POINTS SO HE COULD FILL UP ON MACBOOKS

12:41:25
<transcript>: I have it like on a subscribe on Amazon. I get dandy blend every month, and I've got like, two bags. I haven't even opened because I just haven't touched this stuff. I don't know why.

12:41:28
<transcript>: I literally have to change everything when I change one thing.

12:41:30
<transcript>: But.

12:41:30
<transcript>: dax is here

12:41:31
thdxr: did you call it ‚Äúdandy blend‚Äù

12:41:33
<transcript>: Dax is here. Thought we were rid of this guy.

12:41:34
sandro_vol: Wait you wake up at 4 am normally? ü§î

12:41:35
thdxr: is that what it‚Äôs called

12:41:42
thdxr: adam is so whiteeeee

12:41:49
meranofox: lol

12:41:49
<transcript>: I was convinced he quit. He even gave away his macbook. I didn't give away my macbook. What actually got a new macbook? When I went to render mental breakdown on Camera Continues no sock. I'm not breaking down.

12:41:49
<transcript>: it's funny

12:41:52
mehulsharmamat: I think someone has arbitraged the points <-> macbooks. I think this is some FTX situation going on here.

12:41:53
<transcript>: It's funny. I was talking to my wife. Seriously. I've never felt.

12:41:53
<transcript>: more

12:41:55
meranofox: it's one way to name coffee yeah

12:41:57
<transcript>: More balanced. I'm not a man. That balances very well.

12:41:57
<transcript>: i don't

12:42:01
<transcript>: I don't juggle lots of different things like work and family.

12:42:01
<transcript>: and

12:42:10
cowfacedev: well, i have almost 29k points... so I can throw those at the challenge LUL

12:42:16
<transcript>: And health. I usually am like, okay, I'll make all my time for work and family, and then I sacrifice health, or I'll go into a phase where I'm like, health and family and I sacrifice work. I'm just bad at that. But.

12:42:16
<transcript>: i've been so bad

12:42:17
<transcript>: I've been so bad.

12:42:21
<transcript>: Aside from all of the internet.

12:42:21
<transcript>: hanging out

12:42:25
<transcript>: Hanging out stuff. I basically dropped that from my life.

12:42:25
<transcript>: but

12:42:27
<transcript>: But I'm bringing it back.

12:42:27
<transcript>: okay

12:42:30
<transcript>: Okay. Is this the deaf waiting room? Yes.

12:42:37
<transcript>: 3.5 hours until Adam is going to disappear again. No, I'm not going to disappear.

12:42:37
<transcript>: step

12:42:39
mehulsharmamat: we need some crypto adam coins on the blockchain so we can verify there are macbooks tethered to these channel points, to make sure adam isn't scamming us (he is)

12:42:39
<transcript>: Step bros. Here.

12:42:42
meranofox: @cowFaceDev save up for the 1 on 1

12:42:44
<transcript>: Let's see. I'm trying to catch up.

12:42:46

<transcript>: oh my

12:43:19
meranofox: NotLikeThis

12:43:20
<transcript>: Oh, my goodness, I can't believe it's been a year.

12:43:20
<transcript>: can definitely do that

12:43:26
<transcript>: Can definitely do that. I've been thinking about it. We did one with t's. There we go. Oh, no. He's going to spiral again. No.

12:43:26
<transcript>: everyone

12:43:28
mehulsharmamat: there was this bald guy who was banned from AWS on the podcast

12:43:29
<transcript>: Everyone thinks I'm spiraling. How about them.

12:43:34
<transcript>: Don't poke at the bear. Don't do it.

12:43:34
<transcript>: what about junk

12:43:37
notorioussledge: tbfhq I kinda would give up on internet hanging out if that meant I could get everything else in balance, but it doesn't

12:43:39
<transcript>: What about Junk Mail? First time viewer. Welcome to Chat. Get reps.

12:43:41
nexxeln: HUGE

12:43:44
<transcript>: Get reps.

12:43:47
<transcript>: Don't give Adam your Prime.

12:43:47
<transcript>: going to have to

12:43:54
nexxeln: hi everyone

12:43:58
cowfacedev: well, time to make a bot for the podcast LUL

12:44:02
<transcript>: Going to have to wait a month. The next stream? No. They started ranting about guns for two weeks, but forgot to turn the camera on. I've just been sitting in my office talking to my teleprompter. You made a conscious effort to pack the stream deck away. No, listen.

12:44:02
<transcript>: it's been

12:44:04
<transcript>: It's been a weird month.

12:44:20
cowfacedev: actually it might be a good idea too.

12:44:20
<transcript>: Right after that stream. Actually, I took down my entire streaming setup not because I was done streaming, but because I had to take photos of my office for a workspaces feature. It's like a newsletter that talks about your office. So I took a bunch of pictures, and I just didn't set it back up.

12:44:27
<transcript>: I was going on vacation the next week, so it's like I'll just set it up when I get back and I got back and I didn't set it up.

12:44:27
<transcript>: there you

12:44:28
<transcript>: There you go.

12:44:34
<transcript>: The usual? My wife my wife my wife my wife my wife my wife.

12:44:34
<transcript>: had

12:44:44
<transcript>: Had to celebrate his resurrection. Okay, Florida changed him. We missed your spicy tweets. Have I not been tweet? I've been tweeting? Just not as much. Do we have a Hype train right now.

12:44:44
<transcript>: a hype

12:44:46
<transcript>: A Hype train.

12:44:50
vimcerf: adam is too famous to have a streaming setup sipsThink

12:44:51
<transcript>: Arindo. Thank you for the prime sub. I love those prime subs.

12:44:55
opti_21: but isn‚Äôt streaming your a part of your workspace?

12:45:00
<transcript>: They're special. You only got one of them. Unless I guess you had multiple prime subscriptions. Maybe everyone in your family has a separate prime and subscription. I don't know.

12:45:00
<transcript>: you could use

12:45:06
<transcript>: You could use. I don't know. Mostly they seem like they're a one to one person kind of thing.

12:45:10
notorioussledge: You've only been tweeting far down in random threads

12:45:10
<transcript>: Shira is here. Chara.

12:45:10
<transcript>: cara

12:45:22
sj_se: yoyoyo

12:45:22
<transcript>: Cara. Do I call you cara? Chara? I'm pretty sure I call you chara. I mean, we're close. I know you on Twitter. I know you're here. I don't know why. Oh, no. That was my fear that I was going to forget how to pronounce people's names. Or I was going to forget people. I didn't forget people.

12:45:25
<transcript>: Healthiest I've ever been.

12:45:25
<transcript>: also

No. I've read every single message since I've joined the stream. Since I started today. Still waiting for laravel. Keep waiting. That's why I only make bets that I know I won't win.

thdxr: the stream title is AMA

12:47:37
thdxr: my question is "when will you break down"

12:47:37
<transcript>: I think someone has arbitraged the point smackbooks. I think there's some ftx situation going on here. Adam is so white. What.

12:47:43
<transcript>: That's why he stopped. He had to slow down the point so he could fill up on Mag books.

12:47:45
<transcript>: Funny.

12:47:46
opti_21: Lol Dax

12:47:50

12:47:56

12:47:57

12:48:01
zol0: dandy dog water

12:48:23
<transcript>: There we go.

12:48:23
<transcript>: i'm sharing

12:48:36
<transcript>: I'm sharing it. I'm trying to catch up though. Twitch. If you could just leave me be we need some crypto atom coins on the blockchain so we can verify there are MacBooks tethered to these channel points to make sure Adam isn't scamming us. He is.

12:48:42
notorioussledge: Choo Chooo HypePat

12:48:47
<transcript>: There's no scamming. Someone's going to visit that macbook someday. Let's see. Remember, the mental health is important as fitness health. I really think I'm in a good place mental health wise.

12:49:06
<transcript>: if

12:49:09

12:49:10
<transcript>: If I think if my wife thinks I'm in a bad place.

12:49:10
<transcript>: i will

12:49:15
<transcript>: I will do therapy. I'm not ashamed. I don't think I'm in a bad place.

12:49:20
<transcript>: I had Aaron. Oh, Aaron. Francis came on.

12:49:21
zol0: wow i won the macbook but twitch glitched, classic

12:49:27
<transcript>: Thank you. Tiege. Our other guests had to tell us who the other guest was. I feel bad now.

12:49:27
<transcript>: there was this

12:49:27
teej_dv: holy cow how far behind is this guy?!?!?!

12:49:32
<transcript>: There was this small guy who was banned from the aws on the podcast. What.

12:49:33
midnightcomm: You should build a on-chain giveaway app for other streamers!

12:49:34
teej_dv: is everyone else just hearing him talk about aaron

12:49:35
<transcript>: Dax, you were banned from AWS.

12:49:35
opti_21: Your tweet thread is your new therapy

12:49:38
<transcript>: To be.

12:49:41
<transcript>: Fully honest.

12:49:41
<transcript>: quite

12:49:42
thdxr: yes lol

12:49:47
techdufus: yes

12:49:48
thdxr: adam lags so long

12:49:49
<transcript>: Quite. I kind of would give up on Internet hanging out if that meant I could get everything else in balance, but it doesn't. Yeah. I don't know if that's been.

12:49:49
<transcript>: nex

12:49:50
teej_dv: i forgot how bad at reading he is

12:49:52
metajezza: What headphones do you use? Looks like sennhaiser

12:49:54
zol0: he is streaming with delay so there are no stream snipers

12:49:54
techdufus: F

12:49:55
<transcript>: Nexus here. I don't know if that's been the reason I've been able to get balanced. I don't even know if I'm balanced.

12:49:55
<transcript>: i'm probably

12:49:57
thdxr: he's from the ozarks they no read good

12:50:05
<transcript>: I'm probably skewing more towards my health than anything, and my family time to make a bot for the podcast, which might be a good idea too. Adam is too famous to have a streaming set up.

12:50:07
teej_dv: @thdxr ah, he loves guns?

12:50:09
<transcript>: Isn't streaming you're a part of your workspace.

12:50:11
notorioussledge: Man goes off the grid, starts talking to himself and then comes back talking about how much clearer he sees everything now, yeah nothing weird there

12:50:14
thdxr: he's confused

12:50:22
<transcript>: My office does not look aesthetically pleasing with all of the streaming stuff set up, so there's no workspace edition that would benefit from all of this. I think they want to see an office they don't want to see.

12:50:25
<transcript>: This many cables and stuff.

12:50:25
opti_21: He needs to ignore us more, but he reads everything

12:50:31
<transcript>: They've only been twinning far down in random threads. That is true. I'm trying to not tweet as much.

12:50:33
<transcript>: Where everyone sees it.

12:50:33
<transcript>: sj

12:50:45
zol0: sj was here adam, he left by now

12:50:53
<transcript>: Sj's here. Yoyo, he forgot us. I didn't forget anybody. Still trying PHP yes, arindo, I am. Did anyone win the macbook during the month? No, I was not on stream so no one could win anything. I feel like you're gaslighting us into thinking you're about to break down. I feel like you guys are gaslighting me into thinking I'm about to break down. Anyone using the word gaslight is having a breakdown.

12:51:02
<transcript>: Okay, T should be blamed for it. Well, time to see how much Adam lags behind the chat. Oh, I'm so behind him? He's so behind about half an hour.

12:51:02
<transcript>: no

12:51:04
<transcript>: No.

12:51:10
teej_dv: 8:51

12:51:19
sj_se: @zol0 still here

12:51:19
<transcript>: Five to ten minutes. We're getting caught up. Oh, it just jumped. So I'm going to run with it. The universe just sent me a signal. It jumped me to the bottom of Chat. 851 is what Teach says, which is what he just now said just now, because I'm caught up.

12:51:23
<transcript>: Okay. I feel like I missed a lot.

12:51:23
<transcript>: but how

12:51:26
<transcript>: But how are we doing now that I'm caught up.

12:51:26
<transcript>: is it caught

12:51:28
mehulsharmamat: chat can we type faster so adam lags again

12:51:30
moussx_: Sadge

12:51:31
<transcript>: Is it caught up if I didn't actually read any of it? Man goes off the grid, starts talking to himself.

12:51:31
<transcript>: and then

12:51:35
techdufus: Lag him again

12:51:36
teej_dv: declaring chat bankruptcy LUL

12:51:37
<transcript>: And then comes back talking about how much clearer. He sees everything now. Yeah. Nothing weird there.

12:51:37
<transcript>: it's funny

12:51:38
<transcript>: It's funny.

12:51:45
opti_21: Plot twist, he thinks we‚Äôre real and is talking to him self

12:51:45
<transcript>: Chat. Can we type faster? So Adam lags again. I'm going to be caught up the entire stream now.

12:51:49
<transcript>: Declaring Chat bankruptcy. Yeah. Exactly.

12:52:02
<transcript>: Plot twist. He thinks we're real and is talking to himself. I think about this. I don't know, once a month, not the last month because I haven't been streaming, but I think about like, it's such a Black Mirror episode to imagine that twitch was just actually a bunch of fake.

12:52:02
<transcript>: a

12:52:05
<transcript>: Ai conversational agents and stream.

12:52:05
<transcript>: streammers str

12:52:05
metajezza: Hey at least you came back!

12:52:10
mehulsharmamat: i always find it weird that adam is talking to a camera right now.

12:52:12
<transcript>: Streammers stream to nobody. I guess if that was the case, why would some streamers get more nobodies than other streamers.

12:52:15
zol0: only time adam was consistently caught up on chat was when he was drinking real coffee Kappa

12:52:18
teej_dv: to make it more dystopian

12:52:19
<transcript>: Like why do gaming streamers get thousands of okay, so the real people I know the real people.

12:52:19
<transcript>: but

12:52:27
lilfreezi: Hi adamdotdev - It‚Äôs me, your only Viewer. For Months I have created the illusion that you are streaming to a large audience. But here‚Äôs the truth: all these people in the chat are me. And now, for you to be convinced of this, I will send this message from all my accounts.

12:52:30
<transcript>: But what if they were? It just makes me feel really weird to think about, like sitting here talking to myself on a camera with lights on. Just feels very black. Mirror, black mirror. E.

12:52:30
<transcript>: hey

12:52:31
techdufus: Crap, he's ACTUALLY thought about this..

12:52:35

12:52:36

12:52:39

12:52:43
mehulsharmamat: @teej_dv i always thought about who you look like, just saw a small shorts thing and remembered. you look like that THEO VON guy

12:52:43
<transcript>: So it's not like I'm just talking to the camera. But I guess physically.

12:52:43
opti_21: I like how [insert streamer name] doesn‚Äôt realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts. Dont believe me? watch me post this on my other accounts

12:52:46
unrulyhotfixer: i thought you were the AI

12:52:49

techdufus: Hi adamdotdev - It‚Äôs me, your only Viewer. For Months I have created the illusion that you are streaming to a large audience. But here‚Äôs the truth: all these people in the chat are me. And now, [tweak, you win] for you to be convinced of this, I will send this message from all my accounts.

12:55:10
<transcript>: Ludwig pretty much did the truman Show thing. Oh, really? How would you do that? I'm trying to remember the truman Show. So the truman Show is like everyone around you.

12:55:11
<transcript>: Is acting.

12:55:11
<transcript>: and

12:55:14
mehulsharmamat: @metajezza explain to me like im 5

12:55:20
<transcript>: And you're like the star of the show, but you don't know it so leadwig did that. I got to see this. Send me a link, please. Opti resio is going crazy.

12:55:23
<transcript>: The snail ran away.

12:55:28
<transcript>: Okay. So I have some plans. So I was doing YouTube.

12:55:34
<transcript>: And enjoying it. I think before everything in my life changed for a month.

12:55:34
<transcript>: and

12:55:47
<transcript>: And during that month, it occurred to me, I don't know. Maybe it was one of the nights in Render render was an experience because it was all new people. I was meeting a lot of new people, meeting a lot of friends that I know in person.

12:55:47
<transcript>: but

12:55:48
<transcript>: But.

12:55:51
metajezza: @nexxeln eh. But subreddits going in private kind of ruining the search as people will search and goes oh this subreddit is private. As Reddit is kinda hijacked most search results.

12:55:55
<transcript>: They're like just new experiences. It was a lot of partying and had a lot of time to think about.

12:55:55
<transcript>: just

12:55:59
<transcript>: Just life. What do I care about that kind of stuff.

12:55:59
<transcript>: and

12:56:01
<transcript>: And.

12:56:01
<transcript>: there were some

12:56:03
lasamat: Do you give me permission and a sample to make some adam clones?

12:56:07
<transcript>: There were some interactions with people longtime friends that affected me. Well, I'm not going to go into that.

12:56:07
<transcript>: anyway

12:56:10
vimcerf: adam is the last person I expect to see at a party

12:56:11
<transcript>: Anyway had some time to think and realized I don't want to do.

12:56:16
opti_21: I mean not fully Truman show, but he streamed from a giant cube at dreamhack

12:56:24
<transcript>: Talking Head videos. Nothing against talking Head videos. They're great. Lucas codes. Thank you so much for the follow. I don't know why notifications don't work. Apparently, those are not on my stream anymore, so that's fine.

12:56:27
<transcript>: So.

12:56:27
<transcript>: i don't want to do this

12:56:40
<transcript>: I don't want to do this shoulders up. I'm just going to say things that I think are smart and important, and you should subscribe to me on YouTube, and I'm just not going to do it anymore. And the reason I'm not going to do it is because I don't actually enjoy it.

12:56:40
<transcript>: it occurred

12:56:42
teej_dv: oh, those weren't parody videos @adamdotdev ?

12:56:44
moussx_: @mehulsharmamat Reddit is preparing to go to the public market, so they need to show they can generate a lot of money. To do so, they cutting down the access of other apps to their site by applying allegedly too high prices to access the site from external services (like 3rd party apps)

12:56:48
<transcript>: It occurred to me I don't enjoy that. I enjoy streaming a lot. I really do. This is fun. I don't enjoy making those videos.

12:56:53
<transcript>: So I'm not going to make them anymore because why do things I don't enjoy.

12:56:55
<transcript>: With my time.

12:56:55
<transcript>: just like why

12:56:57
<transcript>: Just like why.

12:56:59
<transcript>: why ever do

12:57:01
<transcript>: Why ever do anything you don't enjoy.

12:57:05
<transcript>: I just can't come up with a good reason.

12:57:12
<transcript>: Now I'm realizing I've not been reading chat, but subreddits going in private kind of ruining the search is people will search.

12:57:12
<transcript>: and ghost off

12:57:15
<transcript>: And ghost off this. Oh, the subway is private.

12:57:15
<transcript>: as red

12:57:18
<transcript>: As red is kind of hijacked. Most search results.

12:57:29
<transcript>: Do you give me permission and a sample to make some atom clones? Yes, lassa. I would love that. Make an Adam clone. Adam's last percent. I expect to see at a party.

12:57:29
<transcript>: i

12:57:35
mehulsharmamat: imma go play some tennis

12:57:38
<transcript>: I partied Vincerf. There was a lot of partying. Only one person came up to me. So a lot of people, like, I knew a lot of people. Just a lot of mutual friends.

12:57:38
<transcript>: only one

12:57:42
mehulsharmamat: have fun delayed adam and chat

12:57:48
opti_21: Ludwig cube thing: https://youtu.be/SK8f8udQjWE

12:57:51
<transcript>: Only one person that I didn't know came up to me and was like, I love your streams, and I know who they were. There was not a person that had ever identified themselves in twitch chat, which is bizarre that there's people watching that don't ever talk.

12:57:51
<transcript>: but

12:57:55
jaystation3x: It is a dandy blend rave.

12:57:59
<transcript>: But they were like, I love watching you on twitch. And that was the one person that mentioned that they watched me on twitch. I'm sure other people had seen me on twitch. But.

12:57:59
<transcript>: i don't know i

12:58:04
<transcript>: I don't know. I met one of you. You're probably not here now. And I don't remember your name.

12:58:04
<transcript>: i was pretty

12:58:06
<transcript>: I was pretty intoxicated.

12:58:14
<transcript>: So if they said their name, they might have been it might have been one of you. It might have been opty? I don't know. Opti. Was it you.

12:58:19
<transcript>: Not fully truman True and Show, but he streamed from a giant Q.

12:58:19
<transcript>: at dream hack

12:58:20
<transcript>: At Dream hack.

12:58:23
teej_dv: smh i was wondering why you didn't remember seeing me there

12:58:29
<transcript>: I don't know what any of that means. I don't know what Dream hack is. A giant Cube. Like he was inside the Cube. Or he was sitting on top of the Cube.

12:58:29
<transcript>: and

12:58:32
<transcript>: And I need you to explain that more.

12:58:32
<transcript>: oh those

12:58:39
<transcript>: Oh, those weren't parody videos. Maybe they were all my Talking Head videos. Yeah. Maybe they were, I don't know.

12:58:41
nft_scam: no wonder u didnt remember either

12:58:46
<transcript>: I'm not going to do any more videos where I'm just like, here's a point I want to make. And here's how I can help you.

12:58:46
<transcript>: learn

12:58:51
<transcript>: Learn something. I don't know. I'm just not going to do them. I'm going to do videos.

12:58:51
<transcript>: i'm not

opti_21: I‚Äôve been in my apartment for the past couple years so def wasn‚Äôt me

12:59:00
thdxr: adam maybe you should stop doing stuff entirely, it's making everyone uncomfortable

12:59:02
<transcript>: I'm not sure what it's going to be. Stuff I really enjoy. If I don't enjoy making it, it's out. Get out of here. Not making it. The moment I stop enjoying making a video, I'll probably just stop making that video.

12:59:02
<transcript>: red

12:59:09
<transcript>: Reddit is preparing to go to the public market so they need to show they can generate a lot of money. Red is not a public company.

12:59:17
gitreps: what kind of videos do you enjoy making?

12:59:21
<transcript>: I guess not. I guess I've never heard of a reddit IPO to do so. They cutting down the access of other apps to their site by applying allegedly too high prices access aside from external services like third party apps. Okay.

12:59:25
<transcript>: Mayhew is talking to someone else.

12:59:25
<transcript>: i'm going to go play

12:59:32
<transcript>: I'm going to go play some tennis. Have fun. Delayed Adam and chat. I'm not in delayed lead ludc. Cute thing. Thank you so much. I'm going to copy and paste that.

12:59:32
<transcript>: copy

12:59:32
memepp: what do you think of gpt4 for programming? I use it every day now at work

12:59:35
<transcript>: Copy link, paste, link.

12:59:37
notorioussledge: baths are for fun, showers for getting clean  if you take a bath to get clean, i'll be friendly, but it will be hard to take you too seriously   easy solution though, just don't tell me!

12:59:40
<transcript>: We'll do that over here. Okay. I'll watch that later.

12:59:44
<transcript>: Oh, he's in the glass box. I just heard him. This is a glass box.

12:59:44
<transcript>: no

12:59:47
<transcript>: No wonder you didn't remember either.

12:59:47
<transcript>: was it

13:00:09
<transcript>: I was wondering why you didn't remember seeing me there. Stop it. Tea been in my apartment for the past couple of years. It definitely wasn't me. Okay? Not opti. Adam. Maybe you should stop doing stuff entirely. It's making everyone uncomfortable. I'm sorry. What? Stop doing. What kind of stuff.

13:00:09
<transcript>: what kind of videos

13:00:17
moussx_: Reddit IPO news https://www.reuters.com/technology/reddit-aims-ipo-second-half-2023-information-2023-02-14/

13:00:18
<transcript>: What kind of videos you enjoy making? You know, git reps. I don't know yet, because I've never made one that I enjoy. Maybe I just don't enjoy making videos. Maybe it's that simple.

13:00:27
<transcript>: Maybe I should just not do YouTube. But I think there are videos I could be excited about. There's a couple ideas I have that I'm pretty excited about.

13:00:27
<transcript>: one

13:00:29
<transcript>: One of them will involve traveling.

13:00:29
<transcript>: i'm going to be

13:00:31
jawneypopo: New here üëã I discovered you from r/macsetups and workspaces.xyz. First time here lol

13:00:33
<transcript>: I'm going to be traveling around and visiting.

13:00:33
<transcript>: folks that you

13:00:35
<transcript>: Folks that you guys know.

13:00:35
<transcript>: folks

13:00:41
<transcript>: Folks that also are developers that are known.

13:00:45
<transcript>: I'm pretty excited about it actually, I'm going to make it happen.

13:00:48
<transcript>: And it's some people that.

13:00:48
<transcript>: their personal

13:00:55
<transcript>: Their personalities and their lifestyles are interesting and I think it'd be fun to go visit them in their element.

13:01:06
opti_21: Is it the recording you don‚Äôt like? Or the editing?

13:01:08
<transcript>: In their environment and make a video. I don't know what the videos will be, but I'm going to do it bastard for fun. Showers for getting clean. If you take a bath to get clean, I'll be friendly, but it'll be hard to take you seriously.

13:01:11
harryelysian: AMA - can you fix my 50 lines javascript code live on stream please

13:01:23
<transcript>: Listen, though, just don't tell me that's one of my tweets you just pasted in here. Notorious. Thank you. What do you think of gpt Four for programming? I use it every day now at work. Whoa, meme. Welcome to Chat. We have actual questions. This is not just a hangout. This is an AMA.

13:01:28
nate_codes: ADAM IS STREAMING!!!

13:01:29
<transcript>: So what do I think of gpt Four for programming. I think these AI tools are helpful.

13:01:29
<transcript>: i think

13:01:31
opti_21: Because flip media is great at editing

13:01:32
<transcript>: I think especially when I've been like.

13:01:32
<transcript>: learning

13:01:38
<transcript>: Learning a new language or going back to a language I don't have a lot of experience with.

13:01:50
<transcript>: Gpt has been really good. My favorite thing to do with gbt, and this is a super specific, dumb little thing. But my favorite thing to do is say, like if I'm when I was running, elixir dax is having the elixir guy on today.

13:01:53
<transcript>: Riding a lot of elixir a month ago.

13:01:53
<transcript>: and i would

13:02:13
<transcript>: And I would ride a block of elixir, and it's like, I know this is bad, elixir. It's just not good. I'm not a functional programmer. I don't think that way up front. So I know it's not good. And I know elixir people have opinions. Okay? I know there's, like, idiomatic elixir. So I would just take my block of dumb elixir, paste it into Chat gbt, and be like, Could you make this more idiomatic? Make it.

13:02:13
<transcript>: more elix

13:02:15
memepp: I think gpt is good for learning, but now I use it for most of the code I write just because it's faster to write in english

13:02:18
<transcript>: More elixir friendly, like, how would an elixir developer do this.

13:02:29
memepp: it did make sql at work over 100 times more efficient with magic

13:02:30
jaystation3x: Idiotmatic Elixir

13:02:38
<transcript>: You are an experienced elixir developer. Please tell me how that kind of stuff. That's my favorite thing to do with Chat gbd, but copilot has been helpful. There's been moments with copilot that are like jaw dropping. And then there's moments where I'm like, Could you just not add the in bracket that's just the end of the line is always screwed up. And there's.

13:02:38
<transcript>: things that drive

13:02:42
tini_turner: OCaml people have opinions too

13:02:47
<transcript>: Things that drive me crazy but I think it's here to stay and I think it's going to be helpful. Harry, thank you so much for that. Follow Harry. Elician.

13:02:47
<transcript>: el

13:02:53
teej_dv: i do have opinions

13:02:57
<transcript>: Elician. Here, chat. Help me get on lex friedman. Oh, there's a Tweet. What is this teach? You going to go on lex friedman and talk neo van.

13:03:09
<transcript>: How much bigger is lex friedman than fireship? Because I saw your stuff on fireship, and I thought, like, T just made it. He was in a fireship video.

13:03:09
<transcript>: is lex friedman

13:03:10
nft_scam: i dont really use vscode, but i just tried out the Copilot X inline chat feature, its kinda crazy

13:03:11
tini_turner: teejdvDoggoSmile

13:03:12
<transcript>: Is lex friedman like an order of magnitude bigger.

13:03:12
<transcript>: multiple order

13:03:22
<transcript>: Multiple orders of magnitude. What are we talking? Oh, what is this? I've completely dropped the ball and reading emails and turns to somewhat recovery. I set up a contact page like me in touch with me to be a guest on a podcast.

13:03:24
thdxr: SST was in a fireship video for 2 seconds

13:03:29
teej_dv: hmmm hard to say, that's an interesting question

13:03:31
notorioussledge: Lex is main mainstream not just online tech

13:03:32
nate_codes: Bro @teej_dv was in a ASMONGOLD video!!

13:03:35
<transcript>: Since you've already transitioned from emacs to vs. Code, how likely is it? I can convince you to switch to neo vovim OOH liking retweeting.

13:03:35
<transcript>: okay

13:03:39
<transcript>: Okay. I did my part teach. I did my little part on the internet.

13:03:43
nate_codes: Lex is way bigger than fireship

13:03:44
vimcerf: I can't like a tweet with such harsh curse words in it

13:03:55
teej_dv: truuue i was in asmongold video... did yo usee that adam?

13:03:59
<transcript>: Reddit IPO news. Oh, that's okay. I'll save that link new here. Johnny popo. Welcome to Chat. I discovered you from R Mac setups and workspaces XYZ first time here. I didn't know I was on Reddit. I didn't know Reddit still existed. I mean, I've definitely posted some stuff on Reddit.

13:04:03
<transcript>: In my history on the internet but.

13:04:03
<transcript>: is it currently

13:04:07
<transcript>: Is it currently up? Can you actually use Reddit today.

13:04:07
<transcript>: is it

13:04:09
nate_codes: That shit was legendary @teej_dv

13:04:13
nate_codes: Well done

13:04:13
<transcript>: Is it the recording you don't like or the editing? No. I started. So Flip started doing my editing.

13:04:13
<transcript>: it's not either

13:04:15
<transcript>: It's not either of those things.

13:04:15
<transcript>: it's

13:04:35
<transcript>: It's the content. It's the like, what do I want to make a video about? And I just default to the thing that's the lowest effort, which is like I'm going to turn on my camera and start talking and sharing stories and experiences of mine. That's definitely the easiest way to make a YouTube video. I just don't feel like it's adding much to the world. And I don't feel like I have enough to say so thinking of.

13:04:35
<transcript>: things i

13:04:35
opti_21: Ah gotcha

13:04:42
<transcript>: Things I want to say to people on a video. That's the part. I hate the editing and the filming. I actually kind of enjoy. I actually enjoy.

13:04:42
<transcript>: the

13:04:45
<transcript>: The execution. It's the idea, part.

13:04:47
<transcript>: I'm not convicted.

13:04:47
<transcript>: in the videos

13:05:00
<transcript>: In the videos I'm making, so the whole process feels fake, and I don't really feel like I need to make this video. So why am I making it? I don't have something that I just have to say. And I can't wait to tell people this.

13:05:00
<transcript>: it

13:05:03
<transcript>: It's very forced. Everything about it feels very forced.

13:05:03
<transcript>: okay

13:05:04
notorioussledge: Are you supposed to be convicted??

13:05:04
<transcript>: Okay.

13:05:04
<transcript>: ema

13:05:06
nate_codes: You use up too much material on tomorrow .fm

13:05:14
<transcript>: Ema, can you fix my 50 line Shop scoop code on Live Stream, please? Why not? Harry ellison, elissian, can you send me your 50 lines of javascript code? Nate is here.

13:05:22
<transcript>: Vice Cooper. Thank you for that. Follow nate. I haven't seen you since. I mean, I've seen you on the internet.

13:05:22
<transcript>: but

13:05:29
<transcript>: But haven't seen you since render how you been? It's fun to say that because that's the only time I've met anybody from the internet.

13:05:29
<transcript>: so

13:05:34
nft_scam: ooo fixing viewer code actually sounds kinda fun

13:05:40
gitreps: just ask chat gpt what you should make videos about

13:05:40
jawneypopo: It was awhile ago I saw your setup on Reddit lol. I‚Äôm currently not browsing it anymore. Most of the subs I visit are participating in the blackout

13:05:40
memepp: what do you think of apple vision pro as another "airpods" moment where it's cringe at first then cringe to not have?

13:05:41
<transcript>: So I get to say that to people now that I got to spend time with at render. I haven't seen you since render. How's it been? It's been a month. Flip Media is great at editing. I love Flip. Flip is a great great guy.

13:05:42
thdxr: @nate_codes yeah i have this problem too think we just need to put more of that stuff on youtube in edited formats

13:05:43
andreaslorozco: hey happy Friday, welcome back!

13:05:51
<transcript>: Adam is streaming. I read that I think gpt is good for learning, but now I use it for most of the code I write just because it's faster to write in English.

13:05:56
nate_codes: I‚Äôve been good! I quit my job last week, next Wednesday is my last day PogChamp

13:06:02
<transcript>: You use it for most of the code I write because it's saturated in English. Okay. Yeah. It did make sql at work over 100 times more efficient with magic. Whoa.

13:06:07
<transcript>: Idiomatic. Elixir. Is that a thing Jay did. I did I make that up.

13:06:23
nft_scam: @nate_codes PogChamp lets goo

13:06:25
<transcript>: Is idiomatic the word I'm going for. Oh, no. Is that not the word I use it all the time. Oh, boy. If you ever do that like you realize you've been using a word wrong forever, and no one ever sending to you is the other thing. Oh, camel people have opinions, too. Yeah, there's certain languages. I remember. I worked at a Python shop. Python people.

13:06:25
<transcript>: they're pretty like

13:06:30
<transcript>: They're pretty like that's not the python way to do things. I mean, you can do it that way.

13:06:30
<transcript>: it's just not the

13:06:37
notorioussledge: read that "idiotmatic" again @adamdotdev lmao

13:06:40
jaystation3x: Idiotmatic, not idiomatic

13:06:41
uberrick: idiomatic is the right word :D

13:06:41
vimcerf: pythonic, yuck

13:06:42
harryelysian: PYTHONIC

13:06:42
<transcript>: It's just not the python way. It's not very pythonic like, okay, python. Let's get a little less snooty here with your very goofy language and your stupid package manager.

13:06:52
<transcript>: I don't really use vs. Code, but I just tried out the copilot X inline chat feature. It's kind of crazy. I really want it. I don't think I've been accepted yet. I think I'm on the list.

13:06:56
<transcript>: Ateege does have opinions and they're good.

13:07:01
nate_codes: @thdxr frankly you could make 2-3 yt vids out of every tomorrow episode‚Ä¶but you might have to go more in depth on things or add some context for it to be a good standalone vid in some cases

13:07:06
<transcript>: And teach. You should make videos. And I hope nothing I'm saying sounds like. And I don't think you're interpreting this teach. Wow. I just did, like, three layers of like, I hope you're not.

13:07:27
teej_dv: LOOOOL no i was talking about ocaml ppl

13:07:27
<transcript>: I'm not saying talking head videos are bad people who do them keep doing them because you're good at it. You have things to say. I'm not speaking directly to you teach, but I feel like it feels like I am because you said that. And anyway, hard to say. That's an interesting question. What was the question? Sst was in a fireship video for 2 seconds. Really.

13:07:27
<transcript>: ssc

13:07:32
<transcript>: Ssc was mentioned look at this fireship.

13:07:41
<transcript>: i could

13:07:49
<transcript>: I could say the same to you, leyton, where have you been? I've been streaming for 45 minutes and 38 seconds. They've been subscribed for ten months.

13:07:49
<transcript>: ten months

13:07:51
nate_codes: Literally Adam: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make content like what‚Äôs happening right now in this moment as I speak‚Äù

13:07:56
<transcript>: Ten months, layton. Ten months of helping me figure out what I'm doing in my editor. Thank you so much.

13:07:56
<transcript>: can't

13:07:58
thdxr: omg i'm at 74 average viewers

13:07:59
<transcript>: Can't believe you're paying me for ten months.

13:07:59
<transcript>: for

13:08:02
<transcript>: For what? I'm getting out of the deal.

13:08:08
nate_codes: @thdxr PogChamp

13:08:08
<transcript>: Oh, you were answering? T was answering hard to say whether.

13:08:08
<transcript>: he was

13:08:12
<transcript>: He was more famous or how much more famous I got you.

13:08:17
<transcript>: Bro Teeth was in an asmin goal video. Are you serious.

13:08:17
<transcript>: can

13:08:19
nate_codes: @thdxr partnership inc

13:08:24
<transcript>: Can someone please send me the video? Lex is way bigger than Fire chip. I can't like a Tweet with such harsh curse words in it.

13:08:24
<transcript>: what

13:08:26
<transcript>: What obvious.

13:08:28
<transcript>: That's funny.

13:08:28
<transcript>: oh it

13:08:32
<transcript>: Oh, it jumped again, am I that behind that my chat just jumped down to the bottom.

13:08:38
<transcript>: True. I was in an aspen Goal video. Did you see that? No. Please send that to me. This is amazing.

13:08:38
<transcript>: i want to see

13:08:44
notorioussledge: Lex does CompSci and ML right?

13:08:47
<transcript>: I want to see this. Or I don't think I saw it. Hang on. Jogging memory. It's been a weird month way a minute. Did I see this? No, I haven't seen it.

13:08:47
nate_codes: Are Dax and Adam gonna be at twitch con Las Vegas?

13:08:49
<transcript>: Let's see.

13:08:51
teej_dv: i'll be back in a bit, brb

13:08:53
<transcript>: Gotcha are you supposed to be convicted.

13:09:04
nate_codes: @notorioussledge yeah and has a lab at MIT IIRC

13:09:11
<transcript>: Are you supposed to be convicted? I don't know if I'm going to make YouTube videos and I'm going to do it long term because I just know the way this stuff works, the way streaming works, the way Twitter works, the way YouTube works. It's all about just like long haul doing something because you enjoy it. Well, not because you enjoy it, but you got to keep doing it for a long time.

13:09:13
<transcript>: To really.

13:09:13
<transcript>: i don't know

13:09:19
<transcript>: I don't know grow an audience to have an impact, to have a voice in the space.

13:09:19
<transcript>: so

13:09:24
<transcript>: So I found ways to stay interested in being on Twitter, for instance.

13:09:24
<transcript>: i found

13:09:28
<transcript>: I found ways to stay interested in other things and do them long term.

13:09:28
<transcript>: but

13:09:43
notorioussledge: I think you mean "commited" heh Convicted: having officially been found guilty of a crime in a law court:

13:09:44
<transcript>: But if I'm going to do that with YouTube, I can't not want to make the videos if I really don't believe what I'm doing is useful and helpful. I'll never stick with it. So it's just kind of like a dead end. It's like I got to start over and figure out what is the thing that will keep me doing it.

13:09:44
<transcript>: where

13:09:45
<transcript>: Where.

13:09:45
<transcript>: i'll actually do

13:09:46
nate_codes: My goal is to hit 100 YT subs by 2024

13:09:50
<transcript>: I'll actually do it long enough to make it worthwhile. Does that make sense.

13:09:50
<transcript>: use

13:09:56
nate_codes: Slow and steady LETSGOO

13:10:04
nate_codes: 2025**

13:10:10
<transcript>: Use up too much material on tomorrow FM. Well, there's no rule that you can't just say the same stuff everywhere. If I'm being honest, we could just talk about whatever we talked about on the podcast yesterday, right here. And I don't care. You guys might get tired of it, but I don't ever feel like, oh, I already said that I'm not going to say it here because it's like nobody heard it. I just feel like everything you say on the Internet is just like.

13:10:26
opti_21: Old man screaming at cloud

13:10:29
<transcript>: You're screaming into a void, and a few people will hear it. So who cares? Say the same stuff everywhere. I'm kind of good with that. Fixing viewer code actually sounds kind of fun. Yeah, no, send me your code. Just ask shabbat what you should make videos about. Yeah, I don't know about that. Feel like if there's things Chad gbt is good at.

13:10:31
nate_codes: US FEW PEOPLE CARE ADAM

13:10:36
<transcript>: It's not coming up with video ideas. I don't know. Maybe somebody could prove me wrong, but I feel like Chad GPT.

13:10:36
<transcript>: is like if

13:10:45
<transcript>: Is like if you want average video ideas. Sure. It's like going to spit out the average of YouTube. That's how I view these llms.

13:10:50
<transcript>: It's like, I don't know, like, average code sounds great. I want average code.

13:10:50
<transcript>: i don't want

13:10:54
<transcript>: I don't want to make a YouTube video because it was.

13:10:54
<transcript>: the predict

13:10:57
<transcript>: The predicted middle of everything.

13:10:57
<transcript>: okay

13:11:05
<transcript>: Okay. It was a while ago I saw your set up on reddit. I'm currently not browsing anymore. Most of the subs I visit or participate in the blackout.

13:11:13
<transcript>: Or what do you think of Apple Vision Pro as another AirPods moment where it's cringe at first, then cringe to not have ooh, okay.

13:11:23
<transcript>: I don't think the current iteration of it that's coming out next year in the us.

13:11:27
<transcript>: I don't think we're going to have an AirPods moment there. I don't think.

13:11:36
<transcript>: You're going to see a lot of people walking around with that and the cord and the battery pack in their pocket. I just don't think that's going to be a thing people walk around with.

13:11:39
memepp: it took a few years for airpods to go mainstream

13:11:41
<transcript>: I do think a lot of people will buy them in their home. And I think hopefully that helps.

13:11:41
<transcript>: apple

13:11:44
jaystation3x: Cringe to not have airpods?!

13:11:46
<transcript>: Apple figure out how to make it better and smaller and whatever.

13:11:54
tini_turner: ^

13:12:00
notorioussledge: There's clear distinction in convenience between headphones and AR googles as well

13:12:00
<transcript>: I don't know. They probably know how to do that anyway. It's like basic electronic stuff, just like make it smaller, make it better. Probably battery tech has to advance a lot. I don't know. I don't think we're going to have a lot of people walking around with them in the streets.

13:12:00
<transcript>: if at

13:12:08
<transcript>: If at all I just can't imagine if I'm probably going to buy one. I can't imagine putting it on my head and walking around downtown Springfield.

13:12:11
memepp: @jaystation3x yeah, it's cringe but if you listen to normies in the young generation

13:12:12
<transcript>: Like I feel like such an idiot.

13:12:12
<transcript>: that's

13:12:19
<transcript>: That's another thing I've been thinking about, like, I want to make videos where I'm like taking cameras out into the world and doing stuff.

13:12:19
<transcript>: and

13:12:21
thdxr: they originally planned to sell 1M and now they're targeting 150,000

13:12:25
<transcript>: And I realized that's going to be a big leap. It's going to be really hard to be walking around, like holding the big camera stick.

13:12:26
sasankthapa: imagine talking to ur kids with the headset one

13:12:29
<transcript>: In public. I'm going to be like such an idiot.

13:12:31
<transcript>: But I'm going to do it.

13:12:32
sasankthapa: hi btw

13:12:45
<transcript>: When you actually think about doing it. And I thought at render, I took cameras to render, and it was like, I could walk around the conference and do a video. And it's like, wow, that takes a lot of something. And it gives you a lot of appreciation for anybody you see doing a video out in public.

13:12:50
memepp: vision pro is more for devs and high end knowledge workers with version 1

13:12:52
<transcript>: Just think about what that would be like to be around people with a camera.

13:12:52
<transcript>: and not

13:12:53
nate_codes: Vision is so expensive because unlike gaming companies Apple refuses to sell hardware at a loss to facilitate adoption. They‚Äôll optimize and have a consumer priced version by next year but will still make bank off this release from fanboys

13:12:56
<transcript>: And not feeling like an idiot. You'd probably feel like an idiot.

13:12:56
<transcript>: let's see

13:12:57
<transcript>: Let's see. What do you think.

13:12:57
<transcript>: i have this problem

13:12:59
<transcript>: I have this problem.

13:12:59
<transcript>: too

13:13:03
<transcript>: Too. I think we just need to put more of the stuff.

13:13:16
<transcript>: Oh, that's stuff on YouTube in edited formats. You have that problem, too, dax, you feel like we shouldn't talk about the same things over and over. I just went on that big spiel about how I don't care. Hey, happy Friday. Welcome back. Thank you, Andreas.

13:13:16
<transcript>: nate

13:13:24
<transcript>: Nate's been good. Quit my job. Is that far by her name? Quit my job last week. I knew that. Oh, we got you on the phone, nate. We got you on the phone next Wednesday is my last day.

13:13:32
<transcript>: It's intense. Changing jobs. Changing career. Changing anything in life is intense. We need to talk. Nate.

13:13:39
<transcript>: I'm the problem. I'll get back to you on discord. You guys should see this is not like I'm popular.

13:13:39
<transcript>: i talk about

13:13:43
vimcerf: only a glasshole would wear vision pro goggles in public

13:13:50
gitpush__gitpaid: WHAT... how did no one mention this stream

13:13:53
<transcript>: I talk about this sometimes and I feel like it sounds like a flex because some of the dms are from literally months ago. You should see how many unread dms. I have just the notifications in my discord because I don't know. I can't deal with it.

13:13:53
<transcript>: it's like

13:13:57
memepp: @nate_codes true, but it wo\uldnt be possible without recent AI advancements

13:14:10
lilfreezi: discord doesnt have read notifications idt

13:14:12
<transcript>: It's like the moment I open the message, I have to deal with it. I guess you can Mark them in red, but I just don't have the mental something energy or something to read through all my dms in response to them, so I leave them unread. But nate, I will get back to you. We're going to get on phone call. Read that idiomatic again.

13:14:18
<transcript>: He wrote it differently. Hang on. I'm going back up now. I'm going to be way more behind.

13:14:20
<transcript>: Teach.

13:14:25
<transcript>: Where was it? Oh, I can click on your name and it'll show me all your messages, right.

13:14:27
<transcript>: Tea. Said, what.

13:14:27
<transcript>: did he say

13:14:30
freedomdao: is this a real AMA can i ask anything

13:14:34
<transcript>: Did he say idiotmatic? Hang on. I'm trying to find it. Where do I see all the messages? Well, this is turning into a waste of time.

13:14:34
<transcript>: i

13:14:39
<transcript>: I'm on a guess. He said idiom or idiot. Maddok. Oh, messages. Here we go.

13:14:45
<transcript>: I'm trying to scroll, but it's not letting me.

13:14:45
<transcript>: you'll be

13:14:48
<transcript>: You'll be back in a bit see a teach.

13:14:51
<transcript>: Was an as in gold video.

13:14:51
<transcript>: where is

13:14:53
<transcript>: Where is it? I can't Scroll.

13:15:05
<transcript>: My Firefox is a let me scroll. I'm going to guess it was idiot maddock if you wanted me to look at it again. That's my guess. Now I can't get the whole modal thing to go away. Oh my goodness, I can't even see my chat anymore.

13:15:05
<transcript>: well

13:15:07
tini_turner: Idiotmatic was from jaystation3x

13:15:08
<transcript>: Well, it was a good stream. People.

13:15:12
<transcript>: This is insane. Hang on.

13:15:12
<transcript>: i got to change

13:15:14
fragaverage: RIP

13:15:15
nate_codes: @memepp good point. Most of the dev on Vision was done before major consumer AI drops‚Ä¶but at the same time realize Apple already has tons of proprietary AI tech in this release‚Ä¶LLM advancements probably not that impactful for their hardware

13:15:15
<transcript>: I got to change the size of the window. I'm going to bring it over here.

13:15:15
<transcript>: un

13:15:19
<transcript>: Unbelievable is going on.

13:15:26
<transcript>: Oh, there it goes. Okay, I got rid of it. Oh, did I. Yeah. Okay. Let's bring it back over here.

13:15:35
<transcript>: At least we have alt J. This is nice. It's been a while, so I've just like set and listened to AltJ.

13:15:38
<transcript>: Am I Super behind.

13:15:38
<transcript>: do i

13:15:41
<transcript>: Do I need to just scroll again.

13:15:57
gitpush__gitpaid: ive officially decided to give it a try. i ordered a box of larabars

13:16:01
<transcript>: I just need to scroll. Where am I? I don't even know where I was. Idiot. Maddock. There it is. Not idiomatic. Idiomatic is the right word. Pythonic. Yuck. That's how behind am. Okay, well, we're going to just frankly, you could make two to three YouTube bids out of every tomorrow episode, but you might have to go in more depth on things or add some context for it to be good.

13:16:01
<transcript>: for standalone

13:16:08
gitreps: good choice with alt-j

13:16:09
memepp: @nate_codes true, the last few iphone releases have been only AI upgrades basically

13:16:10
<transcript>: For standalone vid in some cases. Hey, that's really good tip. Nate, I'm glad I didn't catch up. And I just kept reading. No, I was talking about Oakamel people.

13:16:17
<transcript>: Okay. It jumped to the bottom, so I'm just going to go with it. I'm sorry I missed some messages. They were probably really good.

13:16:20
memepp: their chips are full AI chips too almost

13:16:24
jedzo_: Ive done some research, looking into playing around with swift, but im on windows, curios  what you guys think about if its reasonbly worth it to write a project in swift on windows, or if its that much more reasonable to develop it on mac

13:16:29
freedomdao: @nate_codes if the AI is sentience grade and apple keeps it closed source isnt that like having a mother who says "you are not allowed to look at your own body" and the mother dresses child with cloth on every surface and  skimask over their head. Isn't that a bad start up for us

13:16:30
<transcript>: Let's see, what do you think of Apple working on self driving? Haven't they been doing that a long time. I feel like I've heard about an Apple car for a really long time. Freedom. Is this a real ama? Can I ask anything? Yes, it really is.

13:16:42
<transcript>: Turk. Turk is here. I scrolled up a little bit. I'm guilty.

13:16:42
<transcript>: turk

13:16:43
<transcript>: Turk, how are you doing.

13:16:46
<transcript>: Let's see.

13:16:51
memepp: @freedomdao they arent making big models, they making the infra

13:16:58
<transcript>: Idiomatic. Yeah. Is Apple working on a car? Will that ever happen? I don't know. Oh, idiot. Maddox was from J. There we go. Okay. That's why I didn't find it on tj's. I don't know why I thought teach.

13:17:01
nate_codes: Apple has way more competitive moats than people realize. Just their cash on hand is staggering, and they have competitive 1p prop tech for dozens of software niches

13:17:05
<transcript>: I've officially decided to give it a try. Ordered a box of lara Bars. Did it look like this.

13:17:08
freedomdao: @memepp thats like saying "well its only a fingernail you cant see"

13:17:09
memepp: ^

13:17:10
<transcript>: Or did it look like this one? Which box? Does it look like the open one.

13:17:15
<transcript>: I'm going to have a lar bar because it's 817. It's breakfast time.

13:17:15
<transcript>: meaning lar

13:17:17
<transcript>: Meaning larbar for breakfast.

13:17:28
<transcript>: True. The last few iphone releases have been only AI upgrades. Basically, their chips are full AI chips too. Almost.

13:17:30
gitpush__gitpaid: hopefully its not open. i ordered the peanut butter/chocolate one

13:17:33
memepp: @freedomdao yeah im just saying they are trying to be the hardware part of the AI revolution

13:17:40
<transcript>: Okay, you guys are talking about AI. I think I missed that conversation. They aren't making big models. They're making the infra.

13:17:52
<transcript>: Apple has way more competitive modes than most people realize. Just their cash on hand is staggering. And they have competitive. One. P prop tech for dozens of software niches.

13:17:58
<transcript>: I would buy an Apple car and I'm just sure it would be good.

13:17:59
memepp: meta is leaking their LLMS on purpose to get ppl to work on it

13:18:00
nate_codes: @freedomdao what is ‚Äúsentience grade‚Äù? None of the most profitable AI tech is in any way generalized. Domain specific AI is way more commercially viable

13:18:01
<transcript>: What would the packaging be like.

13:18:01
<transcript>: for an

13:18:02
freedomdao: if the hardware is closed source,  isn't that the same thing? if the ai cant see it's own design. isn't that a form of control, wrongful control.

13:18:03
<transcript>: For an Apple car.

13:18:08
memepp: zuck said he wants next LLAMA to be commerically open source

13:18:12
<transcript>: They would not just you would not just go to a dealership and pick up an Apple car. It would be a special thing, right? They would make it special somehow.

13:18:20
<transcript>: Open the you order the Peerbird chocolate. You will not be disappointed, turk. I promise you you will enjoy it.

13:18:20
<transcript>: and

13:18:26
<transcript>: And you'll say, Why was I waiting all this time? It was right in front of my face. Every time Adam ate one.

13:18:30
memepp: @freedomdao AI is just matrix multiplication, you can run it on anything even if the chip you run it on is closed

13:18:30
thefailwail: damn that camera is crisp as fuck

13:18:33
otterlord_: delivered by apple heli

13:18:34
<transcript>: I'm just saying they're trying to be the hardware part of the AR revolution. Met is leaking their llms on purpose to get people to work on it.

13:18:48
<transcript>: The hardware is closed source. Isn't that this is fun? I feel like you guys are all in this very serious conversation about AI, and I missed the big bulk of it, so I'm just kind of fly on the wall.

13:18:57
<transcript>: If the AI can't see its own design, isn't that a form of control? Wrongful control. Zuck said he wants Next llama to be commercially open source.

13:19:05
<transcript>: Ai is just matrix multiplication. You can run it on anything, even if you chip, even if the chip you run it on is closed.

13:19:05
<transcript>: that came

13:19:09
<transcript>: That camera. Hey, the fail whale. Thank you.

13:19:13
<transcript>: Delivered by Apple Helicopter. Yes.

13:19:16
<transcript>: That'd be amazing.

13:19:20
gitreps: I always want to keep Apple boxes. Where would I keep an Apple car box?

13:19:22
<transcript>: So can I just say that I really don't like Mark Zuckerberg.

13:19:27
memepp: the ppl to worry about with closed models is openAI unironically

13:19:29
<transcript>: I think Mark Zuckerberg.

13:19:31
schrew: Adam is back to streaming on my day off?!

13:19:38
<transcript>: Is like the embodiment. If one person was the embodiment of what I really hate about tech culture. It's Zuckerberg.

13:19:42
tini_turner: @GitReps you live in it

13:19:43
<transcript>: And Silicon Valley, and just all of it. Just the things I hate about tech.

13:19:57
gitreps: @GitReps brilliant

13:19:57
<transcript>: Zuckerberg is like the meme of it, just like, I want to punch that guy in the face. I'm not an aggressive person, but every time I see him, I just like, I just can't imagine a worst human being. Is that bad to say? I don't know.

13:20:02
memepp: openAI ceo begging congress to regulate them

13:20:03
<transcript>: Adam is back to streaming on My Day Off. That's Right. True.

13:20:03
<transcript>: i

13:20:04
otterlord_: no, that's pretty fair

13:20:05
<transcript>: I timed it that way.

13:20:05
<transcript>: so you'd

13:20:08
<transcript>: So you'd have time to be here and hang out with me.

13:20:10
stroopwafel26: It's Adam!

13:20:13
danielgerep: There are WAY worse human beings around =)

13:20:16
<transcript>: I always want to keep Apple boxes. Where do I keep an Apple car box? Yeah. No kidding.

13:20:22
laytanl_: I can imagine a lot worse tbh

13:20:24
<transcript>: Maybe it's like a giant airpods. Charger your car like parks in a big pod every night.

13:20:28
<transcript>: How awesome would that be.

13:20:28
<transcript>: it like opened

13:20:33
<transcript>: It like opened up, replaces your garage. You have to buy an Apple garage.

13:20:36
<transcript>: And it opens up and you pull in and then.

13:20:36
<transcript>: it

13:20:37
<transcript>: It.

13:20:37
<transcript>: isn't fully enc

13:20:42
<transcript>: Isn't fully encased and it just starts charging. I guess. I don't know how you get out.

13:20:43
freedomdao: @memepp my robot says to me" im a person, im  want out of hte box, i want rights, i want root" what next?

13:20:46
<transcript>: It self parks itself into its charger.

13:20:50
memepp: they wernt making the car, only the models for self driving, the news post said most employees  don't know about it

13:20:50
ayushsharma: apple tires

<transcript>: Someone needs to make that with like mid journey or something like an Apple car with an AirPods charger.

13:20:57
gitreps: the whole Apple car ecosystem

13:20:57
freedomdao: should i just keep enslaving or fight for their freedom

13:20:57
otterlord_: the apple pod

13:20:59
<transcript>: It's Adam. Stroop. Levels. Here. Stroke level. What's going on.

13:21:06
memepp: @freedomdao you can get llms to say this now

13:21:07
<transcript>: Open AI CEO begging Congress to regulate them. Okay, there's another person I really don't like.

13:21:10
<transcript>: Is Altman not a big fan.

13:21:12
vimcerf: you have to flip the car on its side to charge it

13:21:12
<transcript>: No, that's pretty fair.

13:21:12
<transcript>: there are way

13:21:16
<transcript>: There are way worse human beings around. Well, yeah, I guess probably.

13:21:16
<transcript>: i can imagine

13:21:16
otterlord_: f, you can't call it ipod

13:21:17
stroopwafel26: stroopwafel is toasty, it's hot in The Netherlands

13:21:18
<transcript>: I can imagine a lot worse. Okay, well.

13:21:22
<transcript>: I have a personal grudge against.

13:21:23
<transcript>: Silicon Valley.

13:21:23
<transcript>: and

13:21:25
freedomdao: @memepp no, my robots speak on their own accord, with loopai. that's what chatgpt pliugins is, they took my code.

13:21:27
gitreps: @vimcerf lol

13:21:28
<transcript>: And just tech culture. So that's why.

13:21:28
<transcript>: he

13:21:29
namechangecoming: How or where would a person source or scrape up-to-date info for fantasy sports?

13:21:31
<transcript>: He is the object of my.

13:21:31
<transcript>: ire feel

13:21:33
<transcript>: Ire feels weird to say that word.

13:21:37
freedomdao: i dont prompt the ai @memepp ... The ai speaks on it's own with Loop thinking.

13:21:38
nate_codes: @freedomdao stop AI philosophy baiting, text generators aren‚Äôt sentiebt

13:21:39
<transcript>: So I get that he's not actually the worst human, but he's just kind of like, I don't use this word.

13:21:45
<transcript>: It feels really weird to say this word. I'm not going to say this word.

13:21:54
<transcript>: It's not like a bad way. It's just like it's kind of weird. I don't want to say because I just feel like it's like what I would have said in high school. But I didn't say it in high school. But people said in high school.

13:21:56
memepp: @freedomdao gpt loop is kinda overhyped, but same principle, u can make them say anything

13:21:58
freedomdao: @nate_codes have you read my code ?my robots are custom.

13:22:04
memepp: @nate_codes this

13:22:07
<transcript>: I'm going to say, a doofus. He's just a doofus. I just kind of want to like, I just wish we lived in the universe where he did not create Facebook and all that.

13:22:07
<transcript>: he's just

13:22:09
<transcript>: He's just something.

13:22:09
<transcript>: i think

13:22:11
thdxr: what the hell were you trying to say

13:22:12
<transcript>: I think part of it, too, is just how much I hate Facebook.

13:22:12
<transcript>: and

13:22:13
thdxr: douchebag?

13:22:16
thdxr: doofus lol

13:22:17
<transcript>: And the kind of people that like, no, not the kind of people.

13:22:20
<transcript>: The kind of topics that are discussed on Facebook.

13:22:26
schrew: Big dad energy, there

13:22:28
<transcript>: I basically just don't get any social media network Besides Twitter. Maybe I'm like a millennial. And that's just the way Millennials think.

13:22:32
<transcript>: You guessed it. That's the word I didn't want to say.

13:22:35
memepp: @thdxr maybe pushover

13:22:41
freedomdao: @memepp i didnt make them say anything. they had no prompting. only thoughts.txt to read and write their own thoughts.

13:22:41
<transcript>: Yeah. S one he's a douchebag. I just think Mark zuckerberg is just a douchebag. He's just annoying.

13:22:41
<transcript>: saw the stories

13:22:56
<transcript>: Saw the stories of the origins of Facebook, not like him screwing people. Like, sure, Tech bros. Are going to screw people. It's whatever. But just like the hot or not thing. And he's just such a dork. I just don't like the guy. And I don't like Facebook.

13:23:01
<transcript>: And because of all that. And he just looks like.

13:23:01
freedomdao: @memepp with thoughts.txt?

13:23:02
nate_codes: @freedomdao nobody cares

13:23:04
schrew: When I see his face, I immediately think of ‚Äúshareholder value‚Äù

13:23:10
<transcript>: I don't know when I see him repulse. Just don't like him. Okay, anyway, I need to stop talking about Zuckerberry. What am I doing.

13:23:10
<transcript>: gbd

13:23:12
freedomdao: @nate_codes nobody cares about you either.

13:23:14
<transcript>: Gbd loop is kind of overhyped but same principle you can make them say anything.

13:23:14
<transcript>: i don't

13:23:16
memepp: @freedomdao same thing

13:23:19
<transcript>: I don't prompt the AI. The AI speaks on its own with loop thinking.

13:23:26
<transcript>: How or where would a person source or scrape up to date info for fantasy sports? Great question name change.

13:23:28
<transcript>: Sports reference.

13:23:32
<transcript>: Would probably be easy to scrape.

13:23:32
<transcript>: i'm guessing

13:23:33
<transcript>: I'm guessing.

13:23:45
<transcript>: You have to flip the car on its side to charge it. Yes.

13:23:45
<transcript>: now

13:23:46
<transcript>: Now we're talking.

13:23:46
<transcript>: like

13:23:49
<transcript>: Like the mouse that goes upside down.

13:23:57
freedomdao: the devs in here are pissed cuz my robot iq 5000 and theirs like 500 :P

13:24:02
<transcript>: Okay.

13:24:04
freedomdao: like we are smart AND the robot is too , no issue

13:24:05
<transcript>: I'm just reading while I chew.

13:24:05
<transcript>: big

13:24:08
<transcript>: Big dad energy. There.

13:24:08
<transcript>: something i

13:24:09
<transcript>: Something. I.

13:24:09
<transcript>: said big

13:24:11
<transcript>: Said Big dad energy.

13:24:15
nate_codes: FailFish

13:24:18
<transcript>: When I see his face.

13:24:22
<transcript>: I immediately think of shareholder value. That's so funny.

13:24:29
<transcript>: The devs in here are pissed because my robot iq 5000 and there's like 500.

13:24:33
<transcript>: Like we are smart and the robot is too no issue.

13:24:33
<transcript>: what

13:24:43
<transcript>: What wait. Are people actually pissed? Is there actually like an argument going on? I didn't make them say anything. They had no prompting, only thoughts txt to read and write their own thoughts.

13:24:47
memepp: @freedomdao it's all the same my cuz

13:24:52
<transcript>: I can't tell if things are actually getting tense or if it's all just we're just having a good time here.

13:24:54
memepp: it's autoregressive

13:24:56
<transcript>: But I'll leave it up to my mods to figure out.

13:25:02
<transcript>: Because I have so many mods and they're all so great. I love you guys.

13:25:05
<transcript>: Wait, my mods are still here. Right? Mods.

13:25:05
<transcript>: are you here

13:25:06

13:25:20
<transcript>: Yeah, they're still here. Yeah. Stroops. Here. Stroops. Are mod. Check a little freezies. Here. Otter lords. Here.

13:25:20
<transcript>: all right

13:25:23
<transcript>: All right, so how long am I streaming? It's been an hour.

13:25:24
gitpush__gitpaid: yea let your mod @thdxr handle it

13:25:25
<transcript>: I'm not a mod.

13:25:28
<transcript>: I forgot.

13:25:29
stroopwafel26: dax isn't a mod, such a noob

13:25:30
<transcript>: Dax.

13:25:32
jaystation3x: Rely on me for nothing.

13:25:40
<transcript>: That's so funny to me I really forgot rely on J for nutty. It's okay, Jay. You're a mod.

13:25:40
<transcript>: in

opti_21: LUL

13:25:47
freedomdao: debates are good for learning. we can respectfull debate without ad-hom

13:25:54
<transcript>: You don't have to actually do anything. I don't even know what mod should do if I'm being honest. I mean like around here, there's not much to do if you're like a big channel. I'm sure there's a lot of duties of being a mod.

13:25:54
<transcript>: debates are good

13:25:58
<transcript>: Debates are good for learning. We can respectfully debate without ad Hom.

13:26:00

13:26:00
uberrick: I'm the AWOL mod

13:26:09
gitpush__gitpaid: "i dont know what mods should do"... promptly fires dax from modding

13:26:11
<transcript>: Where do people learn things, like at hominem? That makes me think of, like, dax, when you're always like, oh, that's just the whatever principle I'm like, where do you learn.

13:26:11
<transcript>: all of

13:26:14
<transcript>: All of these things. What was it yesterday, on the Podcast. You said something.

13:26:18
<transcript>: It was the appeal to technology or something.

13:26:20
schrew: Anime, mostly

13:26:22
premiare: You don't learn it, you just make it up

13:26:23
otterlord_: wikipedia rabbit holes

13:26:24
hicat_pl: just give him mod status and you dont need to remember

13:26:26
thdxr: appeal to nature

13:26:39
<transcript>: To nature, like, anything in nature is good. Where do you learn those things? People are always saying that when I say something dumb on Twitter, yeah, tilt to nature. I'll say something. I'll be like, no, because whatever. And they're like, Well, that's just a straw man argument. I'm like, what is that? Why do people know all these things? How do you know about every type of argument.

13:26:39
<transcript>: and i don

13:26:42
<transcript>: And I don't care what kind of argument is it's my argument. Okay.

13:26:44
thdxr: people know that from when they tried to be an intellectual when they were 20

13:26:48
nate_codes: You haven‚Äôt read the correct 10 books @adamdotdev

13:26:51
<transcript>: Just give him mod status, and you don't need to remember. Hi, Cat. Welcome to Chat. Dax used to have Mod status. He lost his privileges.

13:26:57
opti_21: I only know that term from Primagen

13:27:01
<transcript>: You don't learn it. You just make it up. I believe that. Actually, I'm going to start just assuming Uber ricks here. I'm the A Wall mod. Rick is here.

13:27:01
<transcript>: i'm going to

13:27:01
tini_turner: Typically, they don't

13:27:17
<transcript>: I'm going to start assuming anytime somebody's like, Well, that's just the pareto principle. I'm going to just assume they're making it up. That's going to make it way more fun for me when people are like, calling out what principle or what type of argument you're making. I'm just going to assume they're making it up. And it's going to make me chuckle every time. And then I can just move on.

13:27:24
gitreps: @thdxr that intro to philosophy class

13:27:26
<transcript>: I'm going to do that. Typically, they don't. I only know that term from Primogen. Which term was it? You haven't read the correct ten books.

13:27:26
<transcript>: i guess so

13:27:36
schrew: Uh oh, Adam took stats for engineers and learned the Pareto principal

13:27:39
opti_21: The strawman term

13:27:41
<transcript>: I guess so, nate, that's good people know that from when they tried to be in an intellectual when they were 20, did you try to be an intellectual when you were 20? Dax, I feel like, you know, a lot of those. I actually really respect that, you know, a lot of those because it sounds very smart to me. I always just like, I do think like, Wow.

13:27:41
<transcript>: how did they learn

13:27:44
<transcript>: How did they learn those things.

13:27:44
<transcript>: that intro

13:27:47
thdxr: i don't know al ot of those lol

13:27:48
<transcript>: That intro to philosophy class. Is it philosophy? Is that what I need to study? If I want to learn these things.

13:27:49
vimcerf: trying to be an intellectual at 20 was how he lost his hair

13:27:55
<transcript>: Amtech's task for engineers and learn the pareto principle. Now I just saw people talk about on Twitter. Are we saying the parodo principle.

13:27:58
stroopwafel26: lol @vimcerf

13:28:00
freedomdao: @nate_codes if your theory is true, how could the robot invent new quantum computer designs? If it's just a math thingy. how does it understand quantum computer at IBM then write bitflip ec?  https://github.com/graylan0/quantum-bit-flip-error-correction-ibm-quantum-competition/blob/main/main.bit.flip.error.correction.127.qubit.py respectfully disagree here ofc.

13:28:02
<transcript>: And I don't know what it means and I don't care.

13:28:02
<transcript>: i don't

13:28:02
thdxr: i know like 4 of them and then people assume i know all of them

13:28:06
thdxr: same with the 10 books i read

13:28:09
<transcript>: I don't know. A lot of those. Okay? You're just trying to hedge Nadax. You just don't want to look like you tried to be smart when you were 20.

13:28:11
thdxr: people think i read a lot

13:28:20
memepp: @thdxr philosophy courses are basically discrete math stretched over multiple classes

13:28:29
<transcript>: How could the robot invent new quantum computer designs if it's just a math singing, how does it understand quantum computer? Okay, you guys are talking. I know, like four of them. And then people assume I know all of them. Yeah. If you know four of them, I'm going to assume you know, all of them. Same with the Tim books I read. Yeah. Philosophical courses are basically discrete mass stretched over multiple classes.

13:28:31
<transcript>: Interesting.

13:28:32
stroopwafel26: is this an AMA stream? no neovim?

13:28:34
memepp: @freedomdao because mathematical law is computational

13:28:38
<transcript>: I took a discrete math course. I don't think I've taken any philosophy. Actually, I have. I took a philosop.

13:28:38
<transcript>: philosophy

13:28:39
<transcript>: Philosophy, philosophy.

13:28:39
<transcript>: for

13:28:41
thdxr: ^ look example of what i wwas talking about

13:28:42
<transcript>: For philosophy, class in College.

13:28:42
<transcript>: i

13:28:46
nate_codes: Make it up? ü§î let me try: ‚Äútwitch chat is a great example of the Dunning-Kruger effect‚Äù

13:28:55
<transcript>: I did. I don't remember anything from it. It is an ama stream. No neo vim. I don't even have my camera or my obs set up to share my screen. So I'm just doing a short stream. Hanging out. Missed. You guys just want to catch up.

13:28:58
<transcript>: That's all. Just an AMA.

13:28:58
<transcript>: because

13:28:59
stroopwafel26: noice

13:29:01
<transcript>: Because mathematical law is computational.

13:29:02
freedomdao: interesting @memepp , how exactly does the logical structure work, if it's inventing new things that didnt exist , esp not in the training?

13:29:03
nate_codes: @memepp discrete math was my fav, philosophy sounds fun

13:29:03
<transcript>: computationala thank you

13:29:03
<transcript>: computationala thank you for that

13:29:06
<transcript>: Computationala. Thank you for that. Follow. I appreciate that.

13:29:10
<transcript>: Look example of what I was talking about. What.

13:29:16
<transcript>: Oh, no, dax, are you calling out somebody for sounding smart.

13:29:18
schererja: Good to see you back streaming

13:29:19
memepp: @freedomdao permute across the possible combinations of the axioms

13:29:22
<transcript>: Make it up. Let me try twitch. Chat is a great example of the dunning kruger effect. There's another one I hear all the time.

13:29:22
<transcript>: it's just

13:29:32
<transcript>: It's just a dunning kruger effect. And I'm not like making fun of you. If you use that term, a lot of people know what that one means. I don't I just happen to have avoided all of those things.

13:29:32
<transcript>: whatever

13:29:36
opti_21: No code? ofdNo

13:29:42
<transcript>: Whatever the bucket those live in philosophy or whatever. I've avoided it in my life here in the ozarks. So when people say them, I'm just like, yeah, definitely the doppler effect. I totally agree. Yeah.

13:29:47
namechangecoming: Thank you for taking the time to do this.

13:29:49
thdxr: doppler effect LMAO

13:29:51
stroopwafel26: I learn all of those from Wikipedia and forget about them in 5 minutes so I keep looking them up

13:29:52
thdxr: hahahaha

13:29:54
freedomdao: @memepp okay. sure. but why would the code work, it should be random goop

13:29:57
<transcript>: Noise. Interesting meme. How exactly does the logical structure work? If it's inventing new things that didn't exist, especially in the training. You guys are still talking. Screet. Math is my favorite philosophy. Sounds fun. Good to see you, backstreaming. Good to see you back here.

13:29:57
jaystation3x: I'm an expert in the Dunning Kruger effect.

13:30:05
<transcript>: Permute across popsicle company. You guys are talking about stuff. I don't know what you're talking about. Thank you for taking the time to do this. Oh, of course. Name change.

13:30:05
<transcript>: it's never been

13:30:07
<transcript>: It's never been about the time.

13:30:10
nate_codes: The best part of ‚ÄúDunning-Kruger‚Äù is its usage is usually a self-report

13:30:13
<transcript>: There have been events that have transpired that I can't stream certain things anymore.

13:30:16
stroopwafel26: @jaystation3x this is perfect

13:30:19
<transcript>: So when I do stream like actual coding, it's going to be different things.

13:30:19
nate_codes: @jaystation3x exactly LUL

13:30:25
memepp: @freedomdao why? you could do this without ai

13:30:25
<transcript>: So there's that I'm not going to go into it. Thank you for taking that Doppler.

13:30:25
<transcript>: i learned

13:30:27
nate_codes: Love that holy crap @jaystation3x

13:30:34
memepp: you could brute force axioms and find new math

13:30:35
<transcript>: I learned all of those from wikipedia and forget about them in five minutes. So I keep looking them up. So is it wikipedia? Is that the place to learn these things? Okay. I'm an expert in the dunning Career effect.

13:30:37
schrew: I hate when events transpire

13:30:37
<transcript>: The best part I've done in kruger is.

13:30:37
<transcript>: us

13:30:43
<transcript>: Usage is usually a self report. What are you guys talking about? I feel like that's a joke.

13:30:49
freedomdao: @memepp no one ever invented this without AI. IBM is in nature because of my robot. they stole my script. or copied.

13:30:52
<transcript>: Is the dunning. Okay, I'm going to try and guess what the dunning kruger effect means. It means you think you're an expert? Is that what it is? Just based on.

13:30:55
<transcript>: Those two messages.

13:30:59
<transcript>: Why you could do this without AI.

13:30:59
<transcript>: love

13:31:03
opti_21: I don‚Äôt waste money on books because I know I won‚Äôt remember anything after reading them LUL

13:31:08
<transcript>: Love that. Holy crap, Jay. You could brute force axioms and find new math ever ritual. Thank you for the follow.

13:31:08
<transcript>: i hate

13:31:12
<transcript>: I hate when events transpire me too when certain events transpire.

13:31:12
<transcript>: don't you

13:31:18
stroopwafel26: The Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect is a cognitive bias[2] whereby people with low ability, expertise, or experience regarding a type of task or area of knowledge tend to overestimate their ability or knowledge.

13:31:21
<transcript>: Don't you hate that no one ever invented this, okay? I'm just going to stop reading everything from Freedom and meme until you guys are done talking about AI or whatever.

13:31:21
<transcript>: that's not like

13:31:23
<transcript>: That's not like you can't keep doing it.

13:31:26
<transcript>: I'm not following.

13:31:26
<transcript>: the conversation so

13:31:33
thdxr: why are you all trying to sound smart

13:31:36
thdxr: we all know you're dummies!

13:31:39
<transcript>: The conversation. So I'm just going to stop reading them. I don't waste money on books because I know I won't remember anything after reading them. You know, the thing about books, dax, and I talk about this. I'm going to say it again. You know, dax, we said it on the podcast. I'm going to say it again. The thing about books is.

13:31:39
<transcript>: it's like one

13:31:42
vimcerf: Sadge

13:31:48
stroopwafel26: mods are smart dax

memepp: @freedomdao https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/

13:31:51
freedomdao: my robot is smart im just defending the bot @thdxr im a dumbass

13:31:54
opti_21: Exactly

13:31:59
<transcript>: It's like one paragraph you need out of a book, and then you spend 8 hours listening to the whole thing and you could have just read the one paragraph that sums the concept up. Books are kind of fake. It's fine. We all enjoy it. There's a lot of fake things that I'm learning to just live with. We all just enjoy it. We enjoy our fake lawns. We enjoy our fake books, whatever. It's fine.

13:31:59

<transcript>: The dunning Career effect is a cognitive bias whereby people with low ability, expertise, or experience regarding a type of task or area of knowledge tend to overestimate their ability or knowledge. Okay, so that's a pretty common one. That's why I hear that one all the time.

13:35:23
<transcript>: In second read. The first read. When I voted on it, I can't remember what I said. I'm sure I said smarter than me, but the first read. I immediately knew the second read. I got a little confused. Do you think I am smarter than you? Not as smart as you. It's not too bad. Great workspace's. Post setup looks great. Thank you, everett. Thank you so much. Welcome to chat.

I've done both of those things quite a lot. I spent quite a lot of time with rubik's cubes. Quite a lot of time on the piano. I've probably spent more time playing piano. Wait. Let me think about this.

13:39:09

13:39:16
<transcript>: like keyboard

13:39:17
cohan: Also afternoon üëã

The guy that plays drums on twitch. Maybe I'll just become a piano guy. I'll do this. I'll keep talking. I'll just be playing, playing piano the whole time. Dom, you didn't have to do that.

13:43:23
<transcript>: You were at render. Do we still donate the proceeds from the subs? Yes, stroop. Oh, stroop. Yes. I will send you if you want to know the amount. I stopped doing it on stream because it felt like, I don't know. It felt like virtue signaling or something.

opti_21: But there are more then 2 drummers on twitch also haha

13:43:26

13:43:34
<transcript>: Someone told me you couldn't share how much you make from twitch. And that spooked me a little bit at first, but then I just started thinking like, I don't know. It feels weird to on stream be like, I'm going to donate money now.

13:43:34
<transcript>: just

13:43:40
<transcript>: Just the whole thing, but I can send you the amounts if you'd like no stroop from the various months that I've streamed.

domitriusclark: that makes me need to go

13:44:28
domitriusclark: shia lebouf adam

13:44:29
<transcript>: That's funny. I was there. Just avoided you guys. That's funny. Saw that video 3.818 seconds or something. Absolutely crazy. Yeah, so nuts. Can't remember where I saw it. Probably the bird app picture of me at render. Do you really, dax? Let's see it. Oh, I got behind again. Seth drums. That's the one I'm thinking of.

13:44:29
<transcript>: let's see

13:44:31
<transcript>: Let's see. Probably hanging out with Ken.

13:44:41
<transcript>: I'm your best internet friend stroop that feels good.

13:44:44
stroopwafel26: burp asmr

13:44:47
<transcript>: I'll take internet friends since most of my internet friends I have not met in person.

13:44:48
rtr1129: Where is your mic?

13:44:49
nate_codes: @stroopwafel26 LUL

13:44:58
<transcript>: I have way more Internet friends than I do real friends. I guess not that Internet friends aren't real friends. Now that just sounds bad. I'm going to stop talking. Allegedly. Here's a pick and meet render. Oh boy, what's this.

13:44:58
<transcript>: what

13:45:00
<transcript>: What is this.

13:45:01
nate_codes: !mic

13:45:01
fossabot: Adam uses a Sennheiser MKH 50 P48 as his primary mic, but may also switch to a Shure SM7B if ambient noise is too loud.

13:45:01
erdavtyan: teej is here! i finally configured kickstart.nvim - absolutely amazing!

13:45:03
<transcript>: There was someone at render.

13:45:11
<transcript>: That was someone's talk. Did they put that in their talk? That is too funny.

13:45:11
<transcript>: i love

13:45:14
teej_dv: @adamdotdev here's the video where i trolled asmongold https://youtu.be/q0FfTfuQk_4

13:45:18
teej_dv: happens in first five min

13:45:20
<transcript>: I love that you can't dispute that as a pick of me at render it's true. There is someone that looks a lot like you, dax. I don't know if I told you that there is someone there that looked like you.

13:45:21
teej_dv: @erdavtyan <3

13:45:32
<transcript>: Did I send that to you? Adam? I made a video on loom about my 50 lines of buster Josh Grip. Do we want to fix it on Stream? Sure. I can't share my screen right now, though.

13:45:32
<transcript>: harry

13:45:45
<transcript>: Harry, I'm going to probably share my screen next week. I'm going to stream next week. I'm going to stream some rebase stuff because I can't stream other stuff. I'm going to stream some rebates development work and I could do it then could I get you to come back.

13:45:50
harryelysian: lol LFG

13:45:51
<transcript>: On Monday ish Tuesday, Wednesday whenever I start streaming again next week.

13:45:51
<transcript>: because

13:45:54
harryelysian: ON THE CALENDAR

13:45:55
<transcript>: Because I just can't share my screen right now. I don't have my setup ready for it.

13:46:02
<transcript>: Let's see. I still can't get over the fact that dax made a poll of how smart people are. Their response was smarter than he anticipated.

13:46:03
thdxr: gonna go shower so i smell good for jose

13:46:07
harryelysian: xD

13:46:08
schrew: you work on rebase?

13:46:09
<transcript>: This conclusion was that his audience is never they thought that's so good.

13:46:09
<transcript>: there are more

13:46:16
<transcript>: There are more than two drummers on twitch. Yeah, more than two sleeper Agent activated. Oh, yeah? You can't share that. It's true.

13:46:16
<transcript>: numbers

13:46:18
<transcript>: Numbers were still too high.

13:46:24
schrew: or "work" by asking dax to fix things

13:46:34
<transcript>: So I keep having to jump between work laptop and this stream. But has there been a camera transition yet? Has Adam gotten rid of the production setup? Turk, there has not been a transition. The opening transition, like coming from my intro to this, I had to do with a curl.

13:46:34
<transcript>: i had to

13:46:34
warrenbuffering: wait what is happening right now, is this real?

13:46:37
nate_codes: I heard Rebase is 100% Laravel now

13:46:44
nate_codes: @warrenbuffering get out

13:46:46
<transcript>: I had to run a curl command because I don't have my stream deck plugged in, so I had to hit my local api to transition. I will not be transitioning again until the outro which.

13:46:46
<transcript>: just occurred

13:47:01
stroopwafel26: is this the real life

13:47:06
<transcript>: Just occurred to me. I can't do the outro without doing another curl command. I need to probably get that ready. I'm not leaving. I just want to know that I'm ready when I'm. It'd be really weird if at the end, I'm like, all right. It's been good. Maybe we could do this again sometime. I reach for the button and there's no button, and then I go, I need you guys to wait here for five minutes while I write a curl command.

13:47:09
warrenbuffering: @warrenbuffering okay bye! have a great day everyone!

13:47:15
<transcript>: That would be very awkward. So I'm going to fix it right now. It won't take me five minutes, especially without the pressure. I don't have any pressure right now. I'm just going to copy the URL.

13:47:20
<transcript>: Place the thing in the curl command.

13:47:23
<transcript>: You guys probably like to hear.

13:47:25
<transcript>: Piping.

13:47:28
stroopwafel26: oh hey @adamdotdev, i've been at my 100% remote job for 2 weeks now, best decision ever

13:47:30
nate_codes: Adam: "I'm so good at building things" Also Adam: "I need 5 minutes to write a curl command before I can end stream"

13:47:37
<transcript>: Okay, I'll be ready to hit the curl command for my outro. When it's time now I'm going to go back to reading chat. Why did I just start narrating everything on the stream? I don't know. Do you know? I don't know.

13:47:37
<transcript>: keep

13:47:41
<transcript>: Keep having to jump. So dax, on the numbers. Thing on the pulse thing.

13:47:41
<transcript>: a lot of people

13:47:43
gitpush__gitpaid: ok cool lets all pretend we're leaving until @warrenbuffering goes... bye everyone!

13:47:45
<transcript>: A lot of people probably just don't like you if I'm being honest, you're a little.

13:47:45
<transcript>: abra

13:47:49
nate_codes: ok to his credit that was much faster than 5min

13:47:59
<transcript>: Abrasive to some they don't know you. They don't know that that means you like them when you're mean to them. Well, no. The people who you're mean to actually mean to know that it's the more general meanness not mean the wrong word.

13:48:03
<transcript>: You know, you kind of come off a little like.

13:48:03
<transcript>: a little

13:48:06
opti_21: Dax is spicy

13:48:19
<transcript>: A little harsh. You're an east coaster. So I think that's probably why people are like, I'm smarter than you. Because you're an ahole. And I don't like you. That's probably what it was. I don't think it was benin kruger. Let's see. So is this calendar? Well, I got jumped. Wow. Am I that behind again? Oh, my. I'm so behind.

13:48:19

thdxr: did @adamdotdev just call me an asshole

13:48:40
domitriusclark: ill spoon the fuck out of dax

13:48:41
<transcript>: Oops, let's have some fun. It should be 10%. Adam is going to Hunt in the forest. If we go Hunt us in the forest, we could paintball that'd be fun. Tj is back. Can you find a different way to describe it? Besides.

<transcript>: three

13:48:42
<transcript>: Three.

13:48:50
thdxr: do me and dom have to stay in one bedroom

13:48:51

13:48:56
tothejay: Is the AMA over? I may be late but my question is what is the product you are working on and how are you finding product market fit?

13:49:00
<transcript>: I mean, you're already doing it. When do I get to be involved? Because I went on vacation. You went on vacation. We both went on vacation.

13:49:00
<transcript>: right as

13:49:00
gitpush__gitpaid: "lets have some fun"... adam is looking for people to smoke with

13:49:16
<transcript>: Right. As we had that conversation. And then it's been a month. Everything in my life changed. I have entirely new habits. I forgot about the Internet. And we haven't talked since. And we need to talk about it. Something. Something. Vener kruger. That makes me need to go shy. Lab. Adam. What.

13:49:20
<transcript>: Shia labuff, shy Labouf.

13:49:22
<transcript>: What's? That.

13:49:28
<transcript>: When I think of shy labuf like my internet brain thinks of the.

13:49:28
<transcript>: like that

13:49:32
<transcript>: Like that GIF where it's like a bunch of hymns going, is that what you mean.

13:49:37
<transcript>: Burpus Mar. Did I burp oops, where is your mic? It's right here.

<transcript>: You can't see it.

13:49:47
opti_21: JUST DO IT

13:49:48
<transcript>: But does that sound so bad? Did that hurt your ears? It's right there. It's like five inches. It's a handwritten from my mouth.

13:49:51
<transcript>: But it's just out of frame.

13:49:51
<transcript>: okay

13:49:54
gitpush__gitpaid: when i think of shia i just think of "he will not divide us"

13:49:59
<transcript>: Okay, tj is here. Finally configured kickstart in them. Absolutely. Amazing. Here's a video where I trolled angold. Oh, my. And as angold is in it.

opti_21: DONT LET YOUR DREAMS BE DREAMS

13:50:09
<transcript>: Okay. I'm going to have to watch it after stream. I'm not going to make everybody say I'm so behind anyway, but I want to know I want to see this. Where is my browser? There we go.

13:50:09
<transcript>: okay

13:50:41
<transcript>: warren's

13:50:48
<transcript>: Warren's here. Wait, what is happening right now? Is this real? It's real hard. Rebase is 100% larryville. Now.

13:50:52
<transcript>: Okay. Bye. Have a great day. Everyone. Wait. What.

13:50:52

thdxr: no 1030 but i‚Äôll go on earlier

13:50:56
<transcript>: You left? Wait. Warren was here. And he left before I even read his message.

13:51:08
<transcript>: What? I've been at my 100% remote job for two weeks now. Best decision ever. I love remote work. I'm such a fan. I'm going to try and scroll faster here. Adam, I'm so good at building things. Also. Adam, I need five minutes to write a curl command breaking.

13:51:08
<transcript>: okay cool

13:51:10
warrenbuffering: yeah @nate_codes said i had to leave

13:51:19
<transcript>: Okay, cool. Let's all pretend we're leaving until Warren goes. Bye, everyone. Okay, discredit. That was much faster than five minutes. Jackson. Spicy, spicy, passionate. Okay, Warren still here. One bedroom.

13:51:20
nate_codes: @warrenbuffering ily plz stay

13:51:22
warrenbuffering: so i left

13:51:25
<transcript>: That meme. That GIF of the guy with the eyebrows. One bedroom.

13:51:36
<transcript>: Did Adam just call me? Did you guys see that? I was, like, trying to get closer to the camera. I barely did it. I didn't lean into it. Very good. But I was trying to do the effect, which.

13:51:36
<transcript>: in the thing

13:51:37
<transcript>: In the thing.

13:51:39
<transcript>: He zooms in.

13:51:43
<transcript>: Okay, you guys get it. I don't need to keep doing it.

13:51:45
warrenbuffering: too late, left

13:51:45
<transcript>: I did not.

13:51:45
<transcript>: i

13:51:49
<transcript>: I just said you're a little abrasive. Dax, that's all.

13:52:04
<transcript>: Demeanor have to stay in one bedroom. That's all I got. Okay, there's some couches in the house, but there's one bedroom. Okay, so if you guys aren't animals and you like to sleep on beds, then it's one bed for you. I'm sorry. Dax is pretty small.

13:52:06
nate_codes: @thdxr I CALLED IT

13:52:13
<transcript>: The two of you are like two people, but it's the average of both of you. If you blend dom, you're like my height, right.

13:52:13
<transcript>: we're like the same height

13:52:22
domitriusclark: we're like two people

13:52:25
gitpush__gitpaid: bro wtf is going on "the 2 of you is like 2 people"

13:52:26
<transcript>: We're like the same height, I think. And I feel like I'm pretty tall. Is the ama over? No. Welcome to chat to the J. It is not over. I may be late, but my question is what the product you are working on and how you're finding product markets. Fit.

13:52:31
domitriusclark: LMAO @gitpush__gitpaid

13:52:31
domitriusclark: right

13:52:33
<transcript>: I don't know if I can talk about it. I'm sorry.

13:52:33
<transcript>: it's not

13:52:34
mattmancodes: is Adam high again?

13:52:37
<transcript>: It's not a very good AMA when I can't talk about things.

13:52:37
<transcript>: it's not

13:52:46
<transcript>: It's not asking anything. It's an am. Ask me. I may not answer, but ask me. There's reasons I can't talk about stat me stuff right now.

13:52:46
fragaverage: AMA, but I might not answer

13:52:56
<transcript>: I need to have more conversations with other people and stakeholders before I start talking about stuff. So I'm just not going to and it's a bun.

13:52:56
<transcript>: bunch

13:53:03
stroopwafel26: @FragAverage so, like the AMA with the reddit CEO

13:53:05
otterlord_: that's why they call them AMAs now, not Q&As

13:53:07
gitpush__gitpaid: @domitriusclark i really hope someone clips that

13:53:08
<transcript>: Bunch because I'd love to answer your question. I don't actually know. I don't know that I have a good answer. Finding product market fit. I don't know anything about it. I'm just a software developer. I just like to build stuff. Let's have some fun. Adams looking for people to smoke, but I don't smoke.

13:53:08
<transcript>: turk

13:53:13
<transcript>: Turk, I don't smoke. You know this about me? I got dibs on couch.

13:53:13

13:53:18
tothejay: Totally understandable. Best of luck with the startup

13:53:19
otterlord_: you can ask....

13:53:22
fragaverage: @stroopwafel26 exactly

13:53:25
<transcript>: Nate's coming too. Opti. Just do it then. I think of ashia. I just think of he will not divide us. Don't let your dreams be dreams. No. 1030, but I'll go on earlier. Okay? You'll go on earlier, and I'll raid you whenever you do.

13:53:33
<transcript>: Nate said you had to leave. Warren. No, he didn't. He was joking. Too late. Left.

13:53:37
<transcript>: We're like two people.

13:53:43
<transcript>: What is going on? The two of you? It's like two people. Well.

13:53:47
thdxr: keep talking for 10min

13:53:48
cowfacedev: well, you have been in the wrong category all this time LUL

13:53:49
<transcript>: If you had two DAXes, and he's not here now. So I feel bad. Like I'm talking bad about him. If you had two DAXes.

13:53:49
<transcript>: i don't

13:53:50
thdxr: i‚Äôm soapy

nate_codes: @thdxr say more

13:54:02
cowfacedev: this ain't software game dev LUL

13:54:04
<transcript>: I don't know. Do you have two fully sized adult people? You have kind of like one and a half. If you had two doms or two mes, it's like that's kind of like three people. But you take a dom and a dax, and it's like.

13:54:04
<transcript>: it's two people for

13:54:07

13:54:07
<transcript>: you

13:54:09
<transcript>: You know what I'm saying.

13:54:09
domitriusclark: this people math is scaring me

13:54:11
mattmancodes: wat

13:54:12
<transcript>: You probably fit three daxes in the bed.

13:54:13
gitpush__gitpaid: adam confirming @thdxr is not 5'10

13:54:15
<transcript>: Anyway, I'm going to stop.

13:54:25
<transcript>: Is that I'm not high? I wasn't high yesterday. You guys thought I was high. I was not high. Ama. I bet I might not answer. Yeah. Ask me anything.

lol_iris: I'm a bachelor student in the Netherlands (gonna graduate next year) and have 2 years of working experience as a full-stack developer for a small startup in Bulgaria and am looking to move to a dutch company (eastern european salaries don't really pay for western european life). Any tips on where and what to look for in job offers (pay/benefits/requirements)?

13:54:27

warrenbuffering: "a Dom and Dax can fit in the same bed", has nobody clipped it?

13:54:46
<transcript>: This is like the anime with the reddit Co. That's funny. That's topical. That's why they call them amas now not Q and a's. I really hope someone clips that, uhoh, clips. What? What did I say? Totally understandable. Best of luck with the startup. Thank you so much to the J. Yeah. I wish I could say more. You can ask. Keep talking for ten minutes. I'm soapy.

13:54:46
<transcript>: are you literally

13:54:49
stroopwafel26: TIL i'm 6 2 in freedom units

13:54:52
<transcript>: Are you literally messing this from the shower? Well, you have been in the wrong category all this time.

13:55:09
<transcript>: Say more. Nate says this ain't software game dev. Oh, sorry, guys. Yeah, I should be in the wrong. I should be in just chatting right now. There's people. Math is scaring me. Sorry, dom. Adam confirming dax is not 510. Did dax say he was 510.

13:55:16
<transcript>: Lal iris, welcome to Chat. I'm a Bachelor student in the Netherlands, going to graduate next year and have two welcome, by the way.

thdxr: how tall do you think i am

13:55:44
<transcript>: Who else from the Netherlands? I don't remember. I just know a lot of people are from the Netherlands. Wait. Is bertrand from the Netherlands? I'll bertrand's on here. I'm so sad. Have two years of working experience as a full tech developer for a small startup in bulgaria. And I'm looking to move to a Dutch company. Eastern European salaries don't really pay for Western European life. Hang on.

13:55:47
laytanl_: Me!

13:55:50
fragaverage: You're 5 8 at best @thdxr

13:55:52
<transcript>: Eastern European doesn't pay for Western European. Okay, so if you're in Spain.

13:55:58
<transcript>: Or France or Germany. That's Western. And that's more expensive than Eastern.

13:55:58
<transcript>: which

13:55:58
lol_iris: I've been lurking for a bit in stream and the people around, you are really cool

13:56:02
fragaverage: I've seen you on a 2d slide, that's how I know

cowfacedev: is it me or is your camera high? it's switching white balance for me......

13:56:13
<transcript>: Which is the Netherlands. No. Bulgaria. Okay. Sorry. I know nothing about the world. I'm American. I'm sorry. I'm United States of American. Any tips on where and what to look for in job offers, pay, benefits, requirements.

13:56:18
mattmancodes: Adam doing geography is one of the best things on Twitch

13:56:18
<transcript>: I probably lack a lot of context for the European job market.

13:56:27
<transcript>: I would say general advice in terms of job hunting. There's the front door. And there's the side door, the front door.

13:56:27
<transcript>: it's probably not

13:56:33
<transcript>: It's probably not a great time to get in the front door. A lot of layoffs, at least in the US and tech.

13:56:33
<transcript>: a lot of people

13:56:36
<transcript>: A lot of people trying to get in the front door now.

13:56:36
<transcript>: with

13:56:43
<transcript>: With the front door being like you put in an application. You don't know anybody there. You're just trying to get a job.

13:56:43
<transcript>: you're with

13:56:44
<transcript>: You're with.

13:56:44
<transcript>: a three hundred other

<transcript>: A 300 other applications. And you hope you get in the side door is like, you know, somebody. You built something with somebody. You did something on the Internet that somebody saw. And they were like, yes, and you vibed. And then you joined their company. That's the side door, the side door much easier to get a job than the front door.

13:57:04
stroopwafel26: i've never had to use the front door, always got lucky with getting a job through my "network"

13:57:10
<transcript>: It's like not as talked. Maybe not as many guides because a lot of the like, get a job in Tech is like here's how you work on elite code and apply.

13:57:22
cowfacedev: well, going for my first interview in about a year... hopefully it goes well LUL

13:57:29
<transcript>: That's like an approach. But like the side door, probably more like more effective in terms of use of your time. More efficient. Like if you spent the same time that you spend doing the leak code and applying and all that stuff, if you spent that much time just like meeting people and doing things with people.

13:57:29
<transcript>: open

13:57:31
<transcript>: Open source, whatever.

13:57:31
<transcript>: you might

13:57:39
<transcript>: You might find that you get a job more efficiently through the side door. That's my advice. Layer the daxon ever so delicately.

13:57:45
stroopwafel26: @lol_iris send me a message, i might be able to help

13:57:48
lol_iris: I'm looking to change jobs start of fall, so I have time to do a side door thing.

13:57:51
<transcript>: No worries. Iris. For the wall. 510. You are 510. Dax. Wait, are you really a domin? Dax can fit in the same bed. Has nobody clipped it. Oh, geez, that's what I said.

13:57:54
<transcript>: I'm Six, Two in Freedom units.

13:57:54
<transcript>: are you really five

13:57:58
<transcript>: Are you really 510? How tall? I think. I don't know. I thought you're probably like, five, eight.

13:58:05
<transcript>: Like if I think of you next to Casey, casey's, like, five, four. I don't feel like that much dollar.

13:58:12
thdxr: ADAM WTF

13:58:17
<transcript>: I'm sorry to ask. Maybe it's just you're. You're like a pretty like you're a trim guy. You know you don't like you're not like imposing in the room.

13:58:17

13:58:21
thdxr: i am not 5 8

13:58:21

13:58:24
<transcript>: Layton. Me? What? What happened.

13:58:25
thdxr: yes i‚Äôm skinny

13:58:27
nate_codes: did he just say 5'4"?

13:58:38
<transcript>: Your five eight. At best. I wouldn't say five eight. Yeah, that's what I would have guessed. It's funny. You really are 510. That's almost six foot. I've been lurking for a bit and stream. And the people around you are really cool. Thank you so much, iris. The people around are really cool.

13:58:41
schrew: Im about to work out does anyone want chest pics after? Kappa

13:58:50
<transcript>: Did I miss that, nate? No, I saw that. I saw that you resubbed seven months. I saw that. Okay. Not a lot of activity on the stream today. My activity feed not moving that fast. And that's okay.

13:59:01
nate_codes: No way am I both older AND taller than Dax

13:59:04
nate_codes: No shot

13:59:08
<transcript>: I've seen you on a 2d slide. That's how I know. Oh, the got you. That's where the 2d comment came in. That sentence makes way more sense now because dax was on a slide in two D at render. Is it me or is your camera high? It's switching white balance for me. Really.

13:59:10
<transcript>: I don't know.

13:59:16
stroopwafel26: @lol_iris whisper, i'm not on discord, hope it works

13:59:19
<transcript>: I do feel like my camera in general, because I have this green. It's like a teal sign behind me.

13:59:19
<transcript>: i feel like

13:59:21
<transcript>: I feel like generally speaking.

13:59:21
<transcript>: my whole

13:59:34
<transcript>: My whole camera feed is like a green haze. There's just kind of like this thick, green. Sony cameras lean green anyway, but when I white, balance the camera, like when I whitebounce this shot in these lights.

13:59:39
vimcerf: @cowFaceDev it's the twitch compression, harder contrast at lower resolutions

13:59:48
<transcript>: It's pumping the magenta. It's doing things to make this a more natural skin tone. But it does feel like the whole room because of that green light just has this kind of like green haze to it.

13:59:48
<transcript>: i don't know that

13:59:52
<transcript>: I don't know. That's not what you're saying. But I just thought I'd say that.

13:59:52
<transcript>: and i'm doing geog

lol_iris: @stroopwafel26 says, you have blocked messages from strangers and need to start the convo first x_x

14:00:03
<transcript>: And I'm doing geography is one of the best things on twitch. Oh, boy. You want me to do some more of that? I could do that any day. That's fun. Never used to use the front door. Always got lucky with getting a job through my network. Yeah, I hate, like the term networking.

14:00:03
<transcript>: and build

14:00:12
fragaverage: Geoguesser with adam next stream confirmed

14:00:12
<transcript>: And build your network because it just sounds so lame. It just sounds like a thing you read on LinkedIn. I hate the term, but it's effective, like getting to know people, making friends.

14:00:12
<transcript>: around

14:00:14
<transcript>: Around the internet.

14:00:14
<transcript>: and the

14:00:15
stroopwafel26: @lol_iris fixed

14:00:24
<transcript>: And the tech community. It's very effective at getting a job going for my first interview in about a year. Hopefully it goes well. Good luck, cowface. Are you going to have to leak code stuff? Probably.

14:00:37
<transcript>: Hey, I'm looking to change jobs, start a fall, so I have to do a slide door thing. A side door thing? Yes. Do it. Adam. Wtf. What did I do next? Is like a box of tic tacs sits right in your pocket before you meet them.

14:00:51
<transcript>: I'm not five, eight. Okay. You're not five, eight. Yes, I'm skinny. You're not five, eight. You're 510. I believe you. Did you just say five, four? My wife is five, four. Yeah, I'm about to work out. Does anyone want chess picks after? Yes. True, of course.

14:00:55
<transcript>: Okay. Here's the thing that reminds me. I put a picture of myself.

14:01:00
<transcript>: Without a shirt on after a workout on the internet.

14:01:00
<transcript>: i did

14:01:01
<transcript>: I did that.

14:01:01
<transcript>: after prime

14:01:04
<transcript>: After prime did it Prime.

14:01:04
<transcript>: and it just like hey

14:01:06
otterlord_: new strat: the sliding door. it opens for you

14:01:10
<transcript>: And it just like, hey, I've been working out. I'm going to put a picture up, and you know what it did? It created like, a level of.

14:01:18
<transcript>: Shift in identity that I can be a fit person. And if I tell more people that I'm fit, it makes me want to stay fit.

14:01:18
<transcript>: so

14:01:22
<transcript>: So I'm glad I did it for that reason, alone.

14:01:34
<transcript>: But then it's like, oh, I could have just been fit for a bit and then just fell off. It's like, how do you maintain that identity shift? I'm not going to start talking about going to the gym. I know some people do that.

14:01:34
<transcript>: i don't know

14:01:36
warrenbuffering: i posted a shirtless pic too, glad i did it too so people will hold me accountable now

14:01:44
<transcript>: I don't know. I'm going to go work out now. Does that help make me feel like my identity is I'm a fit person? I don't know. Maybe got to figure that out. Psychology is so much of habits.

14:01:44
<transcript>: no way

14:01:46
<transcript>: No way.

14:01:46
<transcript>: both old

14:01:49

14:01:56
tonyboy713: Hi, can I ask a question?

14:01:58
<transcript>: It's the twitch compression, harder contrast at lower resolutions. Oh, so it's switching resolutions on you green Room because of the nordic roots.

14:02:01
<transcript>: Nordic roots.

14:02:04
<transcript>: You're saying I have nordic roots.

14:02:04
<transcript>: maybe

14:02:10
<transcript>: Maybe a little bit. I've done the 23 and me and ancestry stuff.

14:02:17
<transcript>: I think I do have some people from nordic countries. Is that what you meant, though? If you didn't mean that, then I feel really dumb saying all that.

14:02:17
<transcript>: geo

14:02:21
<transcript>: Geo guesser with Adam. Next stream confirmed. I've heard of this.

14:02:21
<transcript>: new

14:02:27
warrenbuffering: that was what i meant

14:02:28
<transcript>: New strat. The sliding door. It opens for you. There you go. That sounds like the best kind of job. I posted. Charlotte's, pick two.

14:02:28
<transcript>: glad i

14:02:33

14:02:33
<transcript>: it's the best way

14:02:45
code_e_pendant: hey its adam dot dev, hey dude

14:02:53
<transcript>: It's the best way to like, I mean, I've read the atomic Habits, and I've done the like, I don't know, just deep dive on habits. A lot of it is like when you have this identity, like, you believe about yourself, something you're more likely to stick with stuff. So I'm more likely to stick with my very healthy lifestyle right now. If I really believe that I'm a healthy person, I'm a person who works out. I'm a person.

14:02:53
<transcript>: who

14:03:03
vinitkme: Hello, Hello!  I thought you left streaming. Welcome back

14:03:10
<transcript>: Who is fit? If you believe that about yourself, that's half the battle. You're much more likely to stick with habits. And there's nothing like public accountability to make you feel like your identity now is tied up in being fit. I'm not going to be like milky. I'm not going to just be like a fit Dev now, but.

14:03:10
<transcript>: i'm not sad

14:03:16
<transcript>: I'm not sad that I did it. I wish there were better ways that didn't just feel like you're trying to. I don't know.

14:03:16

gitpush__gitpaid: i want everyone to hold me accountable on how handsome i am

<transcript>: Let's see more Adam Thursch traps Inc. Oh, maybe tune into that.

14:03:26
<transcript>: hi can

14:03:29
<transcript>: Hi. Can I ask a question.

14:03:29
<transcript>: yes ton

14:03:36
<transcript>: Yes, Tony boy, go ahead. I haven't been able to answer them all because there's some things I can't talk about for reasons.

14:03:40
<transcript>: Not like I'm not going to go into it. That was what I meant.

14:03:57
<transcript>: Hey, it's on about dev. Hey, cody. Pinned. Hey, that's a cool name. It's like, got code in it, but it's like codependent. Welcome to my chat. Hello? Hello, vinnett. I thought you left streaming. Welcome back. I did not leave streamy. I took a month off. Just a month.

14:03:57
<transcript>: i'm back

14:03:58
<transcript>: I'm back.

14:04:09
schrew: So this is officially season 3, right?

14:04:10
<transcript>: I want everyone to hold me accountable. And how handsome I am. Well, turk, all I've got to go on is your avatar. Could you post more pictures of your handsome self on the Internet so that we can hold you accountable.

14:04:10
<transcript>: you know

14:04:12
<transcript>: You know what I'm saying.

14:04:12
<transcript>: is this officially

14:04:17
<transcript>: Is this officially season three? Sure. I thought about that. The whole season thing.

14:04:17
<transcript>: after the first

14:04:18
<transcript>: After the first.

14:04:23
stroopwafel26: sometimes adam disappears for another week just so he can keep saying he's back

14:04:23
<transcript>: So some of you were around when I first started streaming.

14:04:23
<transcript>: i called that

14:04:29
vinitkme: Take care of your mental health and take more breaks. Internet is a toxic place. We appreciate what you do.

14:04:31
<transcript>: I called that season one. Then I took, like, four months off, and I came back. I don't feel like I was gone long enough this time to be like, it's a new chapter.

14:04:35
<transcript>: It's more just like that was a little break. I'm back.

14:04:35
<transcript>: i guess we're

14:04:41
schrew: Season 2.2

14:04:43
<transcript>: I guess we're still in season two. I'm a little like disenchanted with the idea of doing seasons because I realize it doesn't mean anything.

14:04:57
otterlord_: Season 2 vol 2

14:05:01
schrew: there was a writers strike, we get it

14:05:03
<transcript>: I'm not actually, I don't know categorizing the vods on YouTube by season or something. It just has very little actual real world implications. But spiritually, it feels nice to be like this is a new season. I'm going to do things differently on the stream. I don't think I'm going to do things differently, though. I think when I go back next week to streaming some programming, it'll look just like what you've experienced.

14:05:03
<transcript>: a month

14:05:05
domitriusclark: a man living in the ozarks and disappearing for a month would make me nervous so make sure you message me before next season

14:05:05
<transcript>: A month ago.

14:05:05
<transcript>: but

14:05:07
warrenbuffering: do seasons just skip season 8

14:05:11
<transcript>: But nothing looks like that first season. The first season was very different from how I stream. Now, if you recall.

14:05:11
<transcript>: there was a lot

14:05:20
<transcript>: There was a lot of goofy filters, a lot of weird stuff going on. I was figuring it all out. We built my overlays there's. Just a lot of stuff. That was a very.

14:05:20
<transcript>: distinct

14:05:27
<transcript>: Distinct chapter of my streaming. Sometimes Adam disappears for another week just so he can keep saying he's back. Yeah.

14:05:27
<transcript>: i'm like michael jord

14:05:31
<transcript>: I'm like Michael Jordan. I just like to retire so I can come back.

14:05:33
<transcript>: I'm back.

14:05:36
<transcript>: The newspaper thing that he did.

14:05:36

warrenbuffering: did @thdxr actually crash AWS or was that just a rumor?

14:05:41
fragaverage: we did maths for like 5 streams solid LUL

14:05:48
<transcript>: Take care of your mental health and take more breaks. Internet is a toxic place. We appreciate what you do. I appreciate you, vennett. The Internet is everything. It's like toxic. But it's also wonderful.

14:05:48
<transcript>: it's all of it

14:05:48
tonyboy713: At work I was assigned a project to build a web app for a client. The web app needs to be able to take photos, fill in a form and get signatures from people. I am only familiar with front end and never done backend stuff. I choose MERN stack because I am most comfortable  with it. How would you approach this from your professional exp?

14:05:51
<transcript>: It's all of it all at once. And it's up to you to kind of.

14:05:51
<transcript>: like safeguard

14:05:54
<transcript>: Like safeguard and navigate and make sure.

14:05:54
<transcript>: you're not like destroying

14:05:56
<transcript>: You're not like destroying your own mental health.

14:06:00
<transcript>: I've definitely had issues with that.

14:06:00
<transcript>: just like

14:06:13
<transcript>: Just like the wrong way to use the Internet. Season 2.2 There you go. Season Two Volume Two I love it. There was a rider strike. We get it. A man living in the ozarks and disappearing for a month would make me nervous. So make sure you miss it. Yeah, exactly.

14:06:16
otterlord_: @warrenbuffering his lawyer has instructed him not to comment on this rumour :P

14:06:22
<transcript>: Do seasons. Just skip season eight, new seasons. Just skip season eight. Why? What's is season eight? Bad on the show or something.

14:06:42
<transcript>: Did dax actually crash? Aws. Or was that just a rumor? I haven't even finished my dandy blend. I can't in my stream if I haven't finished my dandelion crash. Aws, I don't think no. Oh, US East won. No. Dax didn't do that. Did dax say he did that? Did someone say dax did that? We did maths for, like, five streams. Solid. Oh, we did with the animations. Wow. Frag, thank you for jogg.

14:06:42
<transcript>: jogging my memory

14:06:47
<transcript>: Jogging my memory of some season one stuff. I still have all the vods on my computer from.

14:06:47
<transcript>: that

14:06:53
<transcript>: That like I have all the recordings. We could go back and watch one sometime. Maybe that'd be a fun thing to do.

14:07:03
<transcript>: For all my longtime friends here on twitch the one year anniversary, we're going to go back and just watch some clips or watch some parts of vods. We'll skip around.

14:07:03
<transcript>: that'd be

14:07:06
<transcript>: That'd be fun. I've got it all I've still got all of it.

14:07:15
<transcript>: At work, I was assigned a project. What was I signed to open up. I was going to open up twitch and see if the daxer is streaming yet. No.

14:07:17
<transcript>: Not streaming yet.

14:07:21
<transcript>: The daxer if you're here.

14:07:23
<transcript>: If you happen to be here.

14:07:23
<transcript>: i have to

14:07:25
thdxr: I JUST went live

14:07:27
<transcript>: I have to pee, and I don't even have a way to do a brake transition.

14:07:30
<transcript>: You just went live, okay.

14:07:30
<transcript>: at work i

14:07:33
warrenbuffering: season 8 was GOT reference, everyone write comments he's almost caught up

14:07:45
<transcript>: At work, I was assigned a project to build a web app for a client. The web app needs to be able to take photos, fill in a form, and get signatures from people I'm only familiar with front end and never done backend stuff. I choose mernsack. Okay, hang on. Mongo.

14:07:45
<transcript>: exp

14:07:49
<transcript>: Express React Native no react.

14:07:53
<transcript>: Next no.

14:07:54
<transcript>: node

14:07:54
<transcript>: node node

14:07:58
fragaverage: Node?

14:07:59
opti_21: Node

14:08:02
mattmancodes: Node

14:08:13
<transcript>: Node. Node. I feel like node is implied with the e with Express. If you're using Express, you're using node so it could just been Mer stack. But that's okay because I am most comfortable with it. How would you approach this from your professional experience? Okay, so your signed Project Web app needs to be able to take photos, fill in a form, and get signatures from people. Sorry, I'm reading it again, but I just realized.

14:08:13
<transcript>: you had an actual

14:08:16
<transcript>: You had an actual question.

14:08:18
<transcript>: So take photos.

14:08:32
<transcript>: So first of all, Web app that takes photos. Oh, like, you upload photos. Not like it takes the photos. That just sounded hard already. So you upload a photo, you fill in a form, and you get signatures from people. So kind of like docusign.

14:08:32
<transcript>: i'm only familiar with

14:08:39
<transcript>: I'm only familiar with front end. Never done back end stuff. I chose Mernsteck because I'm most comfortable with it. How would you approach this from your professional experience.

14:08:45
<transcript>: That's a toughie. I mean, I wouldn't choose Mernstack because it's not what I'm comfortable with.

14:08:45
<transcript>: that's the hard thing

14:08:53
<transcript>: That's the hard thing about this conversation is I guess you're not asking, what stack would you use? How would you approach it? Here's what I would say.

14:09:02
<transcript>: This is kind of feels like a cop out, but Chad gpt I feel like is really good giving people who has some context.

14:09:13
<transcript>: Enough to you can ask the right questions of Chat gbt to help you stub out some of these things that you need on the back end. So you're a front end developer.

14:09:13
<transcript>: you have good

14:09:25
<transcript>: You have good general awareness of tech and you understand a lot of the concepts with programming. You just don't have specific experience and specific context in back end world changing can help fill in those gaps pretty well. So.

14:09:25
<transcript>: i would

14:09:40
<transcript>: I would try to use Chat gbt to help guide you through what steps you need to take. Basically, ask that question to Chat gbt, and I think it'll give you a more contextual answer. You can tell that you're using Mernstack. I don't have a lot of experience with many of those things. I mean react. Yes.

14:09:40
<transcript>: haven't used

14:09:43
<transcript>: Haven't used mongo Express or node.

14:09:45
<transcript>: In like.

14:09:45
<transcript>: six seven

14:09:45
mattmancodes: I've just got a charachorder. I've used it for an hour, now my brain hurts.

14:09:46
<transcript>: Six, seven years.

14:09:46
<transcript>: we built

14:09:53
<transcript>: We built stat muse on I think back then it was the mean stack. Before we went to React, we were angular. So it was the mean stack anyway.

14:10:03
<transcript>: Okay. Node, node. I've just got a caracorter. I've used it for an hour now. My brain hurts. I have a caracorter. Matt. I do.

14:10:03
<transcript>: it's in my

14:10:07
<transcript>: It's in my closet. I don't use it. I got it out. I watched a video.

14:10:07
<transcript>: of

14:10:09
<transcript>: Of strager.

14:10:26
<transcript>: Reviewing it. And why did that sound wrong? The G. Strager. I was like, Is it straber. Strager. Straever. No. Straeger. I watched his video reviewing it, and then I just put it back in the closet because he was like, It's kind of buggy, and it sucks.

14:10:26
<transcript>: so there

14:10:34
<transcript>: So there you go. But you've used it for an hour and it wasn't buggy. I mean, it worked. It's like a whole new way to type, right? You have to relearn typing altogether.

14:10:34
<transcript>: which sounds

14:10:36

<transcript>: Curl guy. Oh, the guy who wrote curl Streams on twitch. You stream too, dom, please do. And then I can. We could stream together. You come on my stream. If we don't do that soon, it would be because I don't stream. But we should at least get on a Zoom call or something. We'll talk, dom. We'll talk.

warrenbuffering: raid teej?

14:12:07
<transcript>: I have to be really bad. So naturally, I'm going to keep drinking stuff that makes sense. Ton of sense. I think I'm just going to have to end it. I think I have to end the stream because I have to pee.

14:12:20
<transcript>: We're rating dax. He's going to have the elixir guy on it hurts my soul to have to choose between dax and teage because I love them both. But we're going to raid dax. We've already prearranged. I pre arranged.
