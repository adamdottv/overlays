00:12:57
<transcript>: Is my more broad guess I guess development robots here.

00:13:06
<transcript>: 404 not found. Is here, man. Let's not waste time. What did you do to dax? That he's got some revenge against you.

00:13:16
<transcript>: 404 I can't tell if you're trolling or if you really think dex is out to get me. Well, I think people do actually believe.

00:13:16
<transcript>: dex

00:13:17
pbertrand_dev: Its pronounced missourah

00:13:21
<transcript>: Dex picks on me because we heard somebody in the tawny stream.

00:13:21
<transcript>: was saying

00:13:25
<transcript>: Was saying how dax is so mean to Adam.

00:13:25
<transcript>: dax

00:13:29
<transcript>: Dax, we're friends. He's just messing with me.

00:13:29
<transcript>: that's how

00:13:31
<transcript>: That's how he shows his affection.

00:13:34
<transcript>: He says a lot of mean things about me.

00:13:36
<transcript>: That's all.

00:13:43
<transcript>: Dung coding hard or hardly coding. That's right. Let's go with hardly coding at the moment.

00:13:51
<transcript>: Awful lots. Here is someone supposed to win when they redeem the tokens, someone will win. Eventually, it's a zero 1% chance.

00:14:11
<transcript>: So one in every 10,000, we ran a simulation to test the code and we found we got a winner after about 5000. So there you go. I don't know how many have been redeemed so far. I am so cold. Can you tell? I'm shivering in every other word I say gets cut off because I'm so.

00:14:11
<transcript>: cold

00:14:12
nartc: Yeah, St Louis. Actually, it's St Charles, or "On the other side of the river" if a St.Louis-ian would phrase it LUL

00:14:14
<transcript>: Cold. It's cold in Missouri.

00:14:16
<transcript>: Burr, Missouri.

00:14:20
<transcript>: Mcnets is here.

00:14:20
<transcript>: st

00:14:30
<transcript>: St. Louis. Actually, it's St. Charles or on the other side of the river. If a Saint, as a St. Louis, St. Louisian would say, would phrase it.

00:14:33
archieedwds: hola

00:14:33
<transcript>: Dax is here. Well, at least.

00:14:33
<transcript>: dax's

00:14:38
<transcript>: Dax's Channel is here. Thank you so much for the raid. Dax. It's weird to say that.

00:14:40
mr_yan19: super surprise raid!

00:14:42
thdxr: you're NOT WELCOME

00:14:42
<transcript>: It's weird to be rated by dax because.

00:14:42
<transcript>: i norm

00:14:44
<transcript>: I normally raid DAX.

00:14:50
<transcript>: Ola archie. Mr. Yan, Surprise, rave. You're not welcome.

00:14:53
<transcript>: Dax. I've already had to answer questions about why.

00:15:02
<transcript>: What I did to make you so mad. Because people think you're so mad at me or that you've got revenge against me.

00:15:11
<transcript>: And I tried to explain that it's just the way you show affection. But I'm not actually sure of that. The more I think about it. Maybe I'm just not getting the hint.

00:15:12
thdxr: that's pretty accurate

00:15:14
<transcript>: Maybe dax actually doesn't like me.

00:15:16
natenorberg: revenge raid

00:15:16
ocelot2123: is that a Dax Fact

00:15:19
<transcript>: It's pretty accurate. Oh, the affection part. Okay, we'll go with that.

00:15:21
jokestera_e: Hes very affectionate about losing his mod job

00:15:21
<transcript>: Revenge.

00:15:21
<transcript>: is that

00:15:26
<transcript>: Is that a Deck sect? No, not an official dax act. Who? I thought of some over the weekend.

00:15:31
<transcript>: He's very affectionate about losing his mind job.

00:15:33
<transcript>: That's funny.

00:15:39
<transcript>: Okay, lots to do today. I shouldn't even be talking right now.

00:15:39
<transcript>: we should just

00:15:40
thdxr: I'm raiding you so more people see your cringe stream

00:15:42
<transcript>: We should just be on my screen.

00:15:45
<transcript>: Because.

00:15:45
<transcript>: i've got

00:15:47
<transcript>: I've got so much to do.

00:15:47
<transcript>: reading

00:15:54
<transcript>: Reading. So more people see your cringe stream. All right, dax, that'll be enough. Now. Thank you.

00:15:54

00:16:15
<transcript>: That might be it.

00:16:22
<transcript>: Russini, thank you for the follows. I appreciate those follows over the weekend. Whatever they were.

00:16:25
<transcript>: Okay.

00:16:27
<transcript>: We're trying to finish.

00:16:31
<transcript>: The stat muse paywall as quickly as possible.

00:16:31
<transcript>: so we can start

00:16:33
<transcript>: So we can start testing it.

00:16:36
<transcript>: Dax, you deleted.

00:16:41
<transcript>: That's too funny.

00:16:45

00:17:05
pbertrand_dev: Kreygasm

00:17:08
<transcript>: I'm not laughing. I'm done. So I got to finish this page. This is like an account page. So when you're on the home page, you got a little avatar here. You can go to Profile. You can sign out if we go to Profile, you can't change the avatar yet, but we're going to make where you can update your email address, which I'm really not excited about building because I don't know. There's going to be so many things I have to do there.

00:17:08
<transcript>: and then

00:17:10
<transcript>: And then manage billing.

00:17:10
<transcript>: i got to

00:17:22
<transcript>: I got to fix a bug, but that takes you to the stripe checkout portal and then delete my account. Another one. I'm not super excited to implement. They're all just buttons. It's like three buttons, but they're so painful. Each one of them is so loaded.

00:17:22
<transcript>: there's so much involved

00:17:25
<transcript>: There's so much involved with each of these buttons.

00:17:27
<transcript>: Censorship.

00:17:32
<transcript>: I love it so much.

00:17:32
<transcript>: oh

00:17:36
<transcript>: Oh, dex, took your mind job and deleted your message.

00:17:40
<transcript>: This is just a good time.

00:17:49
<transcript>: Riz. Thank you for the follow. Also, Robin hoodster. I appreciate the follows. Are these people who are in daxa Stream that didn't know about me.

00:17:55
<transcript>: Were they dax viewers that I hadn't annoyed in chat yet.

00:17:56
ohmymndy: Hello there

00:17:59
<transcript>: Is that possible.

00:17:59
<transcript>: mandy's

00:18:00
<transcript>: Mandy's, here.

00:18:00
<transcript>: man

00:18:04
<transcript>: Mandy? What's going on? Mandy.

00:18:17
<transcript>: Mandy, you've probably got some channel points stored up. There's a chance at a macbook on the line. You can redeem that chance at a macbook thing. You get two a day, two per stream .1% chance at a new macbook pro.

00:18:25
<transcript>: Not a scam. Dax tries to say, It's a scam. It's not a scam. Look at that. I just said something about it. And now everybody's doing it.

00:18:30
<transcript>: Okay, let's see.

00:18:33
<transcript>: The thing I'm trying to fix, I think.

00:18:37
<transcript>: My code by SSC code Incidentally.

00:18:39
<transcript>: Suspicious.

00:18:42
<transcript>: I think my sst code.

00:18:42
<transcript>: is making

00:18:45
<transcript>: Is making some improper assumptions.

00:18:45
<transcript>: and those assumptions

00:18:50
<transcript>: And those assumptions are when session is completed, so handle checkout session completed.

00:18:50
<transcript>: i think

00:18:50
mattmancodes: And no one won... LUL

00:18:53
<transcript>: I think I'm assuming that subscription.

00:18:53
<transcript>: is

00:18:55
<transcript>: Is populated.

00:18:59
<transcript>: But.

00:19:03
<transcript>: I don't know that I can count on that.

00:19:04
archieedwds: oh sweet statmuse uses sst

00:19:07
<transcript>: So sessions, retrieve.

00:19:13
<transcript>: Expand Subscription oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

00:19:15
<transcript>: Wait a minute.

00:19:18
<transcript>: Stripe Subscription status.

00:19:23
<transcript>: That's not the subscription that I'm updating it to. That could be the problem.

00:19:27
<transcript>: Let's see and no ₩1 not yet.

00:19:29
cosmiclasagna: @archieedwds the rewrite is going to be running on sst I believe

00:19:37
<transcript>: Not yet, Batman. You mean just after that big burst of redeems? That was a lot of redeems. Oh, dax, thank you so much for the follow. I really appreciate it.

00:19:38
devstephanvs: what's the bar at the top in your editor?

00:19:38
ohmymndy: This is not elixir right? or is it not Elixir the programming language?

00:19:41
goodgrandpaa: LUL

00:19:42
mattmancodes: haha

00:19:43
<transcript>: Yes, that means archie. It does use ssc. Now. For now, I'm rewriting it.

00:19:43
<transcript>: yeah

00:19:51
archieedwds: haha

00:19:55
<transcript>: Yeah, as long as I don't change my mind and bail on ssd because dax is mean to me. Welcome to Chat dicks. Des Stevens. What's the bar at the top in your editor. That's tmux.

00:19:57
thdxr: adding some code to sst

00:20:08
thdxr: if (adam) delete code + force push

00:20:12
<transcript>: Mandy, this is not elixir. No, no, it is elixir, the programming language. This is a lecture. We're working on the existingapmys.com, which is largely written in elixir, but there's little bits of the api that I'm putting in sst because we're migrating it all to.

00:20:12
<transcript>: astro

00:20:13
<transcript>: Astro.

00:20:18
devstephanvs: ah nice, tnx

00:20:19
<transcript>: If Adam delete code, plus force, push.

00:20:28
<transcript>: You're going to add that to ssc. So if the stage is added to everything I do.

00:20:28
<transcript>: we'll just

00:20:34
<transcript>: We'll just be. What am I doing? I want to look at this. I want to see if it logs. No.

00:20:36
<transcript>: Maybe.

00:20:36
<transcript>: no

00:20:41
ohmymndy: Are you going to migrate to the latest and greatest js framework when you are done with the Astro rewrite :-D ?

00:20:42
<transcript>: No. Oh, there they are. Yeah. Those are the responses. It logged. Okay. Cool. I think I know what the problem is.

00:20:48
<transcript>: I think the problem is let's look at the logs. Actually, I think the problem is.

00:20:51
<transcript>: Check out session completed.

00:20:55
<transcript>: Session completed, and then I expanded the session.

00:20:56
<transcript>: but

00:21:00
<transcript>: But this is the status I took. That's the wrong status.

00:21:00
<transcript>: so i think

00:21:03
<transcript>: So I think the easy solve here is.

00:21:09
<transcript>: Just don't do this. Just don't do it. And then down here.

00:21:09
<transcript>: we've already

00:21:14
<transcript>: We've already got the stripe customer ID, right? Yeah. We just update.

00:21:19
<transcript>: The problem is.

00:21:21
<transcript>: I guess.

00:21:22
cosmiclasagna: who's your guest adam

00:21:25
sockthedev: i miss the snapcam redeems

00:21:28
<transcript>: The problem would be, so maybe I do need to leave it. I just need to actually get the right thing.

00:21:28
laytanl_: adamdevAnimadam adamdevDealWithIt

00:21:30
<transcript>: Subscription set.

00:21:32
<transcript>: What.

00:21:35
<transcript>: Show, what.

00:21:40
<transcript>: So this.

00:21:40
<transcript>: could be

00:21:41
<transcript>: Could be.

00:21:47
<transcript>: Something. Let's see. A session.

00:21:49
<transcript>: Subscription.

00:21:51
schrew: I do miss seeing "dealwithit_adam.jpg"

00:21:56
<transcript>: Could be something other than what I expected. It could be a string but we know that it's expanded.

00:21:59
<transcript>: So let's do this.

00:22:03
<transcript>: Subscription. Yeah.

00:22:05
siddm_33: where i can find your nvim coinfig ?/

00:22:16
ohmymndy: Oh that is a sick shot!

00:22:18
<transcript>: Can I do that.

00:22:20
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:22:23
<transcript>: You miss seeing deal with it.

00:22:23
<transcript>: you do

00:22:27
thelimini: ooo love that keyboard :)

00:22:29

00:22:32
siddm_33: @laytanl_ thanks

00:22:36

<transcript>: diamond

00:22:42
<transcript>: Diamond. Thank you so much for the resub. I'm so sorry I missed it. Also. Ravico. Thank you for the follow.

00:22:47
dmdboi: Thank you thank you

00:22:49
<transcript>: Are you going to migrate to the latest and greatest js framework when you are done with the astro rewrite? No, Mandy.

00:22:49
<transcript>: i'm not

00:22:51
<transcript>: I'm not going to do that.

00:22:54
<transcript>: I'm not a big rewriter.

00:22:54
<transcript>: listen

00:22:55
<transcript>: Listen.

00:22:55
<transcript>: i'm only re

00:23:07
<transcript>: I'm only rewriting because I have to. I know you're supposed to not rewrite or something. Some people say you're not supposed to, but it's definitely not going to be. What am I doing? Definitely not going to be a frequent thing that we do.

00:23:13
<transcript>: Let's say.

00:23:13
<transcript>: as

00:23:13
<transcript>: As.

00:23:13
<transcript>: stripe

00:23:16
<transcript>: Stripe subscription.

00:23:16
<transcript>: cast

00:23:18
<transcript>: Cast it right.

00:23:18
<transcript>: and now

00:23:21
<transcript>: And now we can say.

00:23:23
<transcript>: No.

00:23:27
<transcript>: Just like that.

00:23:27
<transcript>: i think that

00:23:29
<transcript>: I think that fixes our issue.

00:23:31
<transcript>: Think so.

00:23:34
<transcript>: Apparently that's useless. Don't need to do that.

00:23:44
<transcript>: Okay.

00:23:50
<transcript>: Let's turn on keycaster keycaster start casting.

00:23:56
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Sid.

00:23:56
<transcript>: welcome

00:24:01
<transcript>: Welcome, welcome. You missed the snap camera, deans. Yeah, sorry, guys.

00:24:05
<transcript>: Those were fun. They were fun while they lasted.

00:24:05
<transcript>: i guess i could bring them

00:24:06
<transcript>: I guess I could bring them back.

00:24:06
<transcript>: i did do

00:24:14
<transcript>: I did do some stuff to try and retain the Snap camera. I guess I could bring them back at some point.

00:24:19
<transcript>: We'll do like an anniversary stream or something. We'll have the old stuff.

00:24:29
<transcript>: Oh, mandy, that's a six shot. Was it the camera, the keyboard? Yeah, I moved up. I upgraded from Snap camera to moving camera.

00:24:35
<transcript>: Lemony. Thanks. Yeah. The keyboard is great. It really is great. It's the Mode 80.

00:24:40
<transcript>: Okay. So I've updated this.

00:24:44
<transcript>: Let's do this all over again. How do I want to do this.

00:24:44
<transcript>: let's go back here

00:24:46
<transcript>: Let's go back here.

<transcript>: Just like that.

00:25:33
<transcript>: Just like that. Have you tried your Kinesis 364 giving away? Yeah. Mandy. I just got out of the box and kind of, like, felt it just like, put my hands on it. I can see how there's a learning curve. I could see how that would take some time.

00:25:33
<transcript>: to get used

00:25:36
<transcript>: To get used to I.

00:25:36
<transcript>: did not i

vellairoja: Off topic: What is the keyboard switch?

00:25:38
<transcript>: Did not. I did not stick with it.

00:25:50
<transcript>: I immediately was sure that I wanted to give it to somebody. I was pretty sure when I ordered it, but just like the aesthetic and the sound aspect are too important to me with my keyboards.

00:25:50
<transcript>: vel

00:25:59
<transcript>: Vela. Welcome to Chat off Topic. What is the keyboard switch? Oh, the switch is in the keyboard. Are mode. Signal switches.

00:25:59
<transcript>: so

00:26:14
grasp5533: I heard there is gonna be a guest today

00:26:15
<transcript>: So it's a mode keyboard with mode switches. I've got a bunch of just tons of the best switches that everybody loves, and I've not found any switch that I like the sound of better than these mode signal switches. I don't know. I tried them all. I feel like I've tried them all.

00:26:17
rodneypk: Good morning

00:26:18
<transcript>: They're nice.

ocelot2123: holy pandas?

00:26:22
<transcript>: You heard there's going to be a guest today, grass. There potentially will be a guest.

00:26:28
<transcript>: I just realized we booked it weeks ago, and I did not get confirmation from the guest.

00:26:28
<transcript>: i just

00:26:36
<transcript>: I just messaged them this morning. It's possible they're still not up and around. They are on the West Coast. So.

00:26:39
<transcript>: We will see, we'll see what they say.

00:26:39
<transcript>: assuming

00:26:46
<transcript>: Assuming. I mean, we have it on the calendar. So I think it's happening. If it happens, it'll happen like an hour and a half.

00:26:51
pbertrand_dev: musk?

00:26:57
<transcript>: I have tried holdy Pandles off a lot and I've tried Holy pandas Two, the second version that Drop made which I don't know what you think about Drop, but I've tried them all.

00:26:57
<transcript>: well

00:27:03
<transcript>: Well, I haven't tried them all, but I've tried a bunch of them Musk. Yeah, it's having elon Musk on.

00:27:03
<transcript>: going to have

00:27:06
<transcript>: Going to have him on the stream.

00:27:06
<transcript>: just

00:27:10
<transcript>: Just need to get confirmation that he's still going to make it.

00:27:10
<transcript>: but that's right

00:27:11
<transcript>: But that's right.

00:27:12
ohmymndy: I bought my Advantage 2 4 months ago or so, still not fully used to it, especially the less frequently used keys. So, relearning typing is definitely a thing. I felt like such an imposter in the beginning, couldn't even consistently press the space bar... :-D

00:27:14
<transcript>: Not elon Musk.

00:27:18
<transcript>: Okay. Let's do Select.

00:27:18
<transcript>: all

00:27:22
<transcript>: All from users where Email equals.

00:27:26
<transcript>: Okay.

00:27:30
<transcript>: Active active subscriber. Okay.

00:27:32
<transcript>: Now, let's try this.

00:27:32
<transcript>: let's go

00:27:34
<transcript>: Let's go to manage billing.

00:27:50
<transcript>: I need to handle the case where they cancel their account so they're no longer active. Wait. That wouldn't even make them no longer active. We'll try that in a second. 1st let's try this. Let's say I cancel plan through the billing portal. Cancel.

00:28:06
<transcript>: I bought my advantage two, four months ago or so still not fully used to it, especially the less frequently used keys. So relearning typing is definitely a thing. I felt like such an imposter in the beginning couldn't even consistently press the spacebar. Yeah, I've heard looking at it like the whole concave thing. I would not look at it and think like, oh, that's probably really hard.

00:28:10
<transcript>: But I've put my fingers on it. I can see.

00:28:10
<transcript>: how

00:28:13
<transcript>: How it takes some. It's like different.

00:28:21
<transcript>: The shape difference. Okay, so we canceled. But it's not immediately. It's only canceled at the end of your plan. So let's go back.

00:28:26
<transcript>: And now does the managed billing still work? It should.

00:28:27
<transcript>: Sure, of course.

00:28:30
<transcript>: But what happens.

00:28:38
<transcript>: Well, that's the only thing that can happen. I guess I can go in and cancel it manually.

00:28:42
ohmymndy: The thumb cluster was the hardest for me, at least, that's what she said :-P

00:28:45
<transcript>: So that's the only thing they can do is they can cancel it and it'll end at the end of the billing session. But I could go in here and say, Well, what if we want to.

00:28:45
<transcript>: cancel

00:28:47
<transcript>: Cancel immediately.

00:28:51
<transcript>: Yes. Cancel subscription. Now.

00:28:56
<transcript>: Okay. The thumb causer was the hardest for me. At least that's what she said.

00:29:04
<transcript>: That was a good one, mandy. That was a good one. Solid. Thank you for the follow. I don't know why I'm not hearing any notifications.

00:29:12
<transcript>: That's a bummer. Something. Did dax break my overlays? I feel like dax broke my overlays. He's always breaking my stuff.

00:29:12
<transcript>: he probably came

00:29:15
<transcript>: He probably came in and just broke it on purpose.

00:29:18
<transcript>: Okay. Now what happens.

00:29:18
<transcript>: if i go

00:29:27
<transcript>: If I go to manage billing. So first of all, I should see ads. Yes. Okay. Because I'm no longer a paid user. We just canceled my plan.

00:29:27
<transcript>: now if

00:29:30
<transcript>: Now, if I go to manage billing Oh.

00:29:30
<transcript>: i need to add

00:29:33
<transcript>: I need to add something before I forget.

00:29:33
<transcript>: so let's go

00:29:36
<transcript>: So let's go over here and let's say.

00:29:40
<transcript>: Discord server? Yeah, we need to add one of these is going to be.

00:29:43
<transcript>: Ad. Free.

00:29:43
<transcript>: ad

00:29:44
<transcript>: Ad. Free.

00:29:52
<transcript>: Ad free sue, experience.

00:29:57
<transcript>: Sure.

00:30:03
<transcript>: I need to go to manage billing and let's see what happens now.

00:30:05
<transcript>: Undefined.

00:30:05
<transcript>: that's a problem

00:30:10
<transcript>: That's a problem. So we need to have a list case where you hit the page.

00:30:10
<transcript>: and your account

00:30:15
<transcript>: And your account is no longer active. We make too many assumptions in this managed billing thing.

00:30:15
<transcript>: let's see

00:30:18
<transcript>: Let's see, let's go into manage.

00:30:23
<transcript>: So what are we assuming.

00:30:25
<transcript>: We get a session.

00:30:30
<transcript>: At this point.

00:30:33
<transcript>: Let's see, let's go down here.

00:30:36
<transcript>: At this point.

00:30:48
<transcript>: Do they no longer have, like a customer ID? Can I not fetch a session with their name or with Eric County.

00:30:48
<transcript>: let's

00:30:49
<transcript>: Let's just do this.

00:30:58
<transcript>: Console.

00:31:00
<transcript>: Log.

00:31:04
<transcript>: Try this.

00:31:08
<transcript>: I hit this.

00:31:11
<transcript>: It fails. It's not logging.

00:31:11
<transcript>: why is it

00:31:13
<transcript>: Why is it not logging.

00:31:13
<transcript>: is it not

00:31:15
<transcript>: Is it not even getting that far.

00:31:19
<transcript>: Let's see, manage, building.

00:31:23
<transcript>: What does that do.

00:31:33
<transcript>: Manage, billing.

00:31:38
<transcript>: Goes to manage subscription.

00:31:45
<transcript>: So this is what happens. Parans.

00:31:45
<transcript>: use

00:31:48
<transcript>: User kick current user.

00:31:48
<transcript>: is

00:31:55
<transcript>: Is paid. User should be false here. User doesn't have an existing account. Oh, that's just bad logic. That's just bad.

00:31:57
<transcript>: It's just not correct.

00:31:57
<transcript>: that was

00:32:01
<transcript>: That was just a silly mistake. On my end. This isn't stripe's fault.

00:32:01
<transcript>: so

00:32:04
<transcript>: So if they're a paid user.

00:32:04
<transcript>: no

00:32:07
<transcript>: No, it's just if they have a stripe. Customer ID. Right.

00:32:12
<transcript>: It's just that they have a stripe. Customer ID.

00:32:15
<transcript>: Right.

00:32:16
nartc: It took me roughly 2-3 weeks to get used to the Kinesis. Additional 2-3 weeks to get used to my own customization.

00:32:26
<transcript>: Or is it just try to create a building session for any user.

00:32:26
<transcript>: thanks

00:32:30
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow kenrick codes.

00:32:36
<transcript>: Took me roughly two to three weeks to get used to the kinesis additional two, three weeks to get used to my own customization.

00:32:36
<transcript>: you

00:32:42
<transcript>: You know what I do have I don't have a Kinesis anymore, but I do have a caracorter.

00:32:44
<transcript>: It's weird.

00:32:52
<transcript>: I have not spent the time to learn it, but theoretically you can type it like 350 or 400 words a minute.

00:32:59
<transcript>: It's like your fingers are on these little joysticks. And each joystick moves like four different directions. So you never move your fingers.

00:32:59
<transcript>: or will you move them

00:33:05
<transcript>: Or will you move them? But you don't lift them. They're always touching. Okay? It's like two little balls that you're holding like this.

00:33:14
mr_yan19: Oh, I've seen strager try to learn one of those 'keyboards'.  They were invented by aliens.

00:33:19
<transcript>: But the thing that gets you such speed is you can hit all the letters at once. They're called chords. And it types the word like it figures out what word you're trying to say by. I don't know. All the letters you hit. Does that make sense? Yes. Straeger. Yeah.

00:33:23
laytanl_: Took me about a week to get used to and faster with kinesis. I was/am not a fast typer though

00:33:36
<transcript>: They were invented by aliens. Yeah. I've watched Straeger's review of it. And that's when I got it out. It's in my office closet. Here. I got it out. And I was like, Do I want to do this? So I looked up a review and it was streger. And that was the first I'd ever seen Straeger. I watched his review of it, and I was like, nah, not for me.

00:33:40
<transcript>: Because striker goes into like the bugs and all this stuff.

00:33:40
<transcript>: took me about

00:33:43
nartc: Oh that is like for people who write _notes_ down in court or something right? xD

00:33:46
<transcript>: Took me about a week to get used to and Sasha with kinesis. I was am not a fast diaper though.

00:33:52
<transcript>: I always thought I was a fast typer. And then last time I did a typing test on Stream, it was so slow.

00:34:03
<transcript>: I was not fast. It took me like three tries just to get up to 100 words a minute. I thought it was like 100 and 2130 words a minute. Guy. I don't know if like I've lost it, if I ever had it.

00:34:03
<transcript>: i could just

00:34:09
<transcript>: I could just have a bad memory. Okay. What do I want to do here? I want to create a billing session.

00:34:12
<transcript>: I want to create a billing session.

00:34:14
<transcript>: If.

00:34:18
<transcript>: I can.

00:34:21
<transcript>: Manage subscription so.

00:34:21
<transcript>: if

00:34:24
<transcript>: If they're not an active user.

00:34:29
charafmrah: 100WPM isn’t fast? 🤯

00:34:34
<transcript>: I guess we could just send them to sign up. No, that doesn't make sense.

00:34:38
<transcript>: I think what I need to do is do case.

00:34:40
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:34:46
goodgrandpaa: I think i'm currently a 120wpm person lol

00:34:46
<transcript>: Let's do case.

00:34:46
<transcript>: off

00:34:48
<transcript>: Off.

00:34:48
<transcript>: user

00:34:50
<transcript>: User get current user.

00:34:56
<transcript>: Case. And then we're going to say.

00:34:59
laytanl_: I'm at like 80

00:35:01
<transcript>: Stripe.

00:35:03
<transcript>: Subscription status.

00:35:07
<transcript>: Whatever don't care.

00:35:11
<transcript>: Equals user.

00:35:17
<transcript>: If that's the case, we know that they have or no, I guess.

00:35:17
<transcript>: stripe

00:35:31
<transcript>: Stripe Customer ID I don't even care if they have a subscription status. I just care. Do we have a stripe customer for this person? Thanks for the follow east vood and heaton heaton Dev miss that one as well.

00:35:51
<transcript>: Tough day, boys. What happened? Diamond? What happened? I think for the follow coder fair. You're having a stroke? Are you serious.

00:35:58
<transcript>: you actually having

00:35:59
<transcript>: You actually having a stroke.

00:36:11
<transcript>: Or you meant from the typing. You said, Tough day, and then you said, you're having a stroke, and I'm panicking. But I think you meant, like because you're typing so bad, it must be a stroke as a joke. Was that a joke.

00:36:20
<transcript>: Diamond. Does anyone have diamonds? Phone number? Do we need to check on diamond? Diamond? Are you okay? If you hear me.

00:36:24
<transcript>: I need you to mash the keyboard with whatever you can reach with.

00:36:31
<transcript>: Surely if you were actually having a stroke, that would not be the thing you did is type out. I'm having a stroke in my chat.

00:36:32
dmdboi: No I just couldn't spell tough, I didn't get the expected outcome from an appraisal meeting

00:36:34
<transcript>: Diamond.

00:36:34
<transcript>: no

00:36:37
<transcript>: No, I just couldn't spell, though. Okay.

00:36:46
<transcript>: Not so close. I didn't get the expected outcome from an appraisal meeting. Well, I'm sorry about that Diamond I saw in dax's Chat that you were going to an appraisal.

00:36:49
<transcript>: I'm sorry that you didn't.

00:36:49
<transcript>: that can suc

00:36:52
<transcript>: That can suck. I know that world.

00:36:57

00:36:57
<transcript>: i don't know you said

00:36:58

00:37:18
<transcript>: Oh, okay, well, I'm glad at least you got some humor out of it. I hope you didn't think I was too flippantly discussing your stroke. I feel like we could guilt trip Adam into doing anything based on that reaction. Please don't use that against me.

00:37:22
<transcript>: First on Stream, twitch, Chat stroke. Yeah, no kidding.

00:37:29
<transcript>: Okay. We almost lost him. It's true. Kyle. Welcome to chat.

00:38:46
<transcript>: You saw my larvae and had to get one. I swear I should be sponsored? I really should be.

00:38:52
<transcript>: It's to deal with the shock.

bishopdev: that sounds Orwelian

00:39:04
<transcript>: Kyle, thank you so much for the follow.

00:39:07
<transcript>: Sounds Orwellian no.

00:39:07

mattmancodes: someone checking everything you eat and rating how many larabars you eat

<transcript>: And they just, like, keep track of everything I eat, and they let me know if, like, you're kind of lacking.

00:39:22
<transcript>: in this area

00:39:23
<transcript>: In this area. For nutrition.

00:39:25
gingerstorm999: Is this a cult?

00:39:30
<transcript>: Or they help me with workouts. And they're kind of like a personal trainer, too. It's kind of like all in one.

00:39:36
bishopdev: oh .. I can do that for you, my rates are ~100$/hr

00:39:40
goodgrandpaa: Are you sponsored by the company that makes larabar? LUL

00:39:46
maleero: Oh no, I'm outa Adam bucks! LUL

00:39:48
<transcript>: Larvar programmers. First choice. That's right. Someone checking everything you eat and rating how many Larbars you eat? No, they did tell me I can only eat one a day. Like I was eating like, three and four. And they're like, let's set an initial goal of just eating one larbar day, like, fine.

00:39:53
<transcript>: Oh no maliro.

00:39:53
<transcript>: out of adam

<transcript>: it's like not just

00:40:46
<transcript>: It's like not just the nutrition.

00:40:55
<transcript>: It's about psychology. More than anything. It's like helping you retrain your relationship with food and with exercise. I'm just so sedentary with my work.

00:40:58
<transcript>: I need somebody like I've. I've gone stretches.

00:40:58

00:41:13
<transcript>: i needed something

00:41:20
<transcript>: I needed something. And that's what Adam wathen talked about. Like he had tried a lot of things, just never stuck with stuff.

00:41:23
<transcript>: So this thing allegedly has worked for him.

00:41:23
<transcript>: and

00:41:30
<transcript>: And I'm going to try it. We'll see I'd like to long term, just have a better relationship with healthy lifestyle stuff.

00:41:34
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:41:42
<transcript>: I thought everyone was talking about the dog. Oh, yeah. Is samuel's bigger than Larbar collab Inc.

00:41:50
<transcript>: I don't know how big lara Bar is. I mean, no, sammy's is not bigger than larvae. I'm sure they're making plenty of money. I bought so many lara bars.

00:42:27
grasp5533: Yeah I struggle with eating too much.  I'm just bad about having proper meals, and end up snacking a ton

00:42:30
fragaverage: What is this Blueski thing?!

00:42:39
laytanl_: New mastodon

00:42:41
<transcript>: Frag blue sky is the new mastodon, but I think it's better.

00:42:41
<transcript>: maybe

00:42:43
<transcript>: Maybe allegedly.

00:42:51
fragaverage: So its another twitter?

00:42:54

00:42:58
nexxeln: no one is giving me an invite Sadge

00:42:58
<transcript>: Seriously, I want an invite. Who can give me an invite.

00:43:01
<transcript>: Another Twitter. Yeah, basically.

00:43:05
laytanl_: Its literally twitter

00:43:08
<transcript>: Next. You don't have an invite either. There's no hope for me, tito. Thank you for the follow.

00:43:09
charafmrah: Mastodon with an easier onboarding process

00:43:12
<transcript>: It's literally Twitter minus Elon.

00:43:14
lebricoleurfantastique: For me, its really indeed just counting the calories, currently getting back into the calorie deficit, so no fun food time LUL

00:43:23
laytanl_: Designed exactly the same too

00:43:31
<transcript>: Yeah, somebody give me somebody to give me an invite. That'd be great.

00:43:31
<transcript>: i'll make you a vip

00:43:33
<transcript>: I'll make you a vip, maybe even a moderator.

00:43:45
<transcript>: Lebricolor Fantastic. Welcome to Chat for me. It's really, indeed, just canon Calories currently getting back into calorie deficit. So no fun food time. Yeah.

00:43:50
<transcript>: I eat a lot of good foods. We've been whole food plant based for a long time.

00:43:53
thdxr: no one invite adam

00:44:07
<transcript>: We eat no process. Well, I mean, lara bars, I guess how processed it's like dates and nuts. But mostly for the most part, our meals are balanced, plant based diets or plant based diet. Like we eat good. But I never limit how much I eat. So I just eat way too much. I know I do.

00:44:11
goodgrandpaa: Have you had oyster mushrooms?! Kreygasm

00:44:11
<transcript>: Especially in the evening. I just kind of never stop.

00:44:21
mattmancodes: Can you eat too much plant?

00:44:25
<transcript>: Anytime we count calories, it's like, I realize, oh, I should just consume what my body actually needs. Last few days, it's been really interesting. Like, let myself actually get hungry and start to feel almost like, weak.

00:44:30
mr_yan19: The struggle is real.  I eat way too much at night too.

00:44:30
<transcript>: I just never let myself get that way on my own so it's been nice.

00:44:35
<transcript>: Twitter. What is this? Tweet. Oh, you're just.

00:44:35
<transcript>: we'll do twitt

00:44:42
<transcript>: We'll do Twitter time in a minute. I design exactly the same time. No one invite Adam dax, stop it.

00:44:42
<transcript>: have you ever

00:44:45
sockthedev: are you vegan? no dairy etc?

00:44:49
<transcript>: Have you ever had oyster? Mushrooms? Yes. Good, grandpa. I love all kinds of mushrooms. Can you eat too much plants.

00:44:52
goodgrandpaa: Those things are so good.

00:44:52
<transcript>: It's harder.

00:44:56
<transcript>: Like when you're not consuming oil.

00:44:56
<transcript>: and other really

00:45:00
thdxr: mushrooms so good

00:45:01
lebricoleurfantastique: Yeah get that totally! Lost 20kg about 44 pounds last year, just by just not eating to much

00:45:08
<transcript>: And other really broken down processed foods that are denser, like plant based food fills your stomach before you really overeat too much, but it's still possible. Like nut butters. There's still things I just eat too much.

00:45:12
<transcript>: Are you Vegan? Yes, we're vegan.

00:45:27
<transcript>: Struggles real. I eat way too much at night, too. Yeah. Okay. So I'll let you guys know how this thing works out. And if there's things I can just share with you guys that I learned from it. So you don't have to sign up for something like this. I'll share that stuff. I'll let you know.

00:45:29
mr_yan19: If you've ever had a beyond burger you know you can eat too much plants

00:45:31
<transcript>: Mushrooms so good. Yeah. I love mushrooms.

00:45:31
<transcript>: we do

00:45:37
<transcript>: We do like a tofu scramble in the mornings with mushrooms and onions and spinach and stuff. It's delicious.

00:45:41
goodgrandpaa: @Mr_Yan19 Ngl, I prefer Impossible :P

00:45:48
grasp5533: My fiance has celiac, and it makes eating out stressful

00:45:51
<transcript>: Lost 20 kg, about £44 last year. Thank you for putting it in pounds. So I didn't know I had no idea how much that was just by not eating too much. Yeah. You don't even have to change what you eat if you just kind of limit yourself.

00:45:55
mattmancodes: "Don't eat 400 larabars a day" - There's a freebie

00:45:56
<transcript>: They say there's like a lot of studies about caloric intake and longevity.

00:45:59
<transcript>: You can almost.

00:45:59
<transcript>: plot

00:46:02
dmmulroy: Faux scallops made w/ King Oyster mushrooms are so freaking good

00:46:03
<transcript>: Plot calorie intake with lifespan.

00:46:03
<transcript>: which is

00:46:05
<transcript>: Which is kind of crazy.

00:46:09
<transcript>: I don't know how true it is, but I think there's something to it.

00:46:14
<transcript>: You prefer Impossible burgers.

00:46:16
goodgrandpaa: @dmmulroy I've been wanting that too!!

00:46:24
<transcript>: My fiance has celiac, and it makes eating out stressful. Yeah. So when you're plant based, especially in the ozarks, eating out of the stress. There's just not a lot of places we can eat out.

00:46:24
<transcript>: don't

00:46:29
<transcript>: Don't eat 400 Larabies a day. That's a freebie. Yeah. Don't eat three a day.

00:46:33
<transcript>: All right.

00:46:33
<transcript>: let's get back

00:46:34
<transcript>: Let's get back to it.

00:46:39
<transcript>: Getting back to it.

00:46:40
dmmulroy: Definitely recommend, it's so easy and so good. Scratches the itch of real scallops

00:46:49
<transcript>: Definitely recommend it so easy and so good. Scratch the issue of real scallops. Oh, faux scallops made with King oyster mushrooms.

00:46:55
<transcript>: Okay. So what I need to do here.

00:46:58
thdxr: adam i’m meeting david k piano rn

00:47:02
goodgrandpaa: @dmmulroy Very good! I need to go into a region that promotes this diet haha. OH ain't it LUL

00:47:07
<transcript>: Is a current user and they have a stripe customer ID. We can go down this path. Right here, right.

00:47:08
<transcript>: Otherwise.

00:47:08
thdxr: remember when you used xstate

00:47:12
goodgrandpaa: Adam, isn't there a special guest today?

00:47:17
<transcript>: Otherwise how did they get here? Otherwise it's just an error. There's nothing I can do.

00:47:23
<transcript>: There's nothing I can do if they don't have a stripe customer ID and they're trying to manage the subscription.

00:47:28
<transcript>: So.

00:47:28
<transcript>: i think

00:47:28
goodgrandpaa: Or is it us? Kappa

00:47:31
lebricoleurfantastique: Ask them how they feel about it LuL

00:47:36
<transcript>: I think it's okay to throw an error here, and we just need to limit that button showing up if they don't have a stripe customer ID.

00:47:42
<transcript>: So they somehow create a user, which we don't allow right now. But if they somehow create a user.

00:47:44
dmmulroy: @GoodGrandPaa If you've got a whole foods near you, they generally have the right mushrooms

00:47:44
<transcript>: Without.

00:47:46
<transcript>: A stripe Customer ID.

00:47:51
<transcript>: Oh, maybe there is a case where let's try this actually.

00:47:54
<transcript>: There might be a case where this happens.

00:47:58
<transcript>: Let's log out. Well, let's try manage billing. Now.

00:47:58
<transcript>: it should work now

00:47:59
<transcript>: It should work now.

00:48:06
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow. Flow fields. Flow fields. And gus Ran. I missed that one.

00:48:10
<transcript>: Why did I see your name? And immediately say flow.

00:48:13
<transcript>: I forgot that the word flow.

00:48:13
<transcript>: was a

00:48:15
<transcript>: Was a word.

00:48:21
<transcript>: Oh, interesting. So if you show up here.

00:48:25
<transcript>: With no active subscription.

00:48:29
<transcript>: Okay.

00:48:33
goodgrandpaa: @dmmulroy Right! Closest one is 1h8m away! Sadge

00:48:40
<transcript>: Pcy thank you for that. Follow. Interesting. So if you show up here you can't even subscribe you can't buy it from here.

00:48:45
<transcript>: So it's like I need to just take them back to the checkout flow.

00:48:52
<transcript>: Adam, isn't there a special guest? Yes.

00:48:59
<transcript>: Oh, dax, you're meeting David K. Piano? Yeah, I had him on the stream. Way back.

00:49:03
<transcript>: You're meeting him for Wait. Is he in Florida.

00:49:03
<transcript>: oh is

00:49:07
<transcript>: Oh, is he just still in Miami? Do you never leave.

00:49:15
<transcript>: Tell David I said Hello.

00:49:15
thdxr: he’s in orlando

00:49:20
thdxr: but still in miami yeah

00:49:25
<transcript>: He's in Orlando, but still Miami. Got you.

00:49:25
<transcript>: so i think

00:49:31
dmdboi: Can we gamble these Adam coins

00:49:32
dmmulroy: Ooof, well when you want to move to Raleigh, lmk and I'll show you around

00:49:32
<transcript>: So I think I just need to send them if they click Manage billing. We'll change the button name to be like Subscribe.

00:49:36
<transcript>: But if they do, we can just redirect them.

00:49:39
<transcript>: I think we can just redirect them.

00:49:40
dmdboi: Bet on how many times Adam gets distracted

00:49:40
<transcript>: To.

00:49:43
<transcript>: Or we could just do this.

00:49:46
<transcript>: Just subscribe them.

00:49:46
<transcript>: we

00:49:47
<transcript>: We did that.

00:49:47
<transcript>: what if we

00:49:49
<transcript>: What if we did that.

00:49:53
<transcript>: Nil.

00:49:53
<transcript>: no

00:49:55
<transcript>: No user.

00:49:57
<transcript>: And then.

00:49:57
<transcript>: nil

00:49:58
<transcript>: Nil.

00:50:01
cosmiclasagna: @dmdboi someone should make a counter

00:50:03
<transcript>: Nil if they don't have a user.

00:50:08
<transcript>: There is no user. Then we should just return an error. I guess.

00:50:08
<transcript>: or i could read

00:50:14
<transcript>: Or I could read just redirect them then too. Let's just redirect them to the login page.

00:50:16
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:50:16
<transcript>: this feels

00:50:17
pcyqku: !commands

00:50:18
fossabot: @pcyqku Channel commands are available at: https://fossabot.com/adamdotdev/commands

00:50:19
thdxr: ADAM LOOKOUT BEHIND YOU

00:50:20
<transcript>: This feels good. So redirect to.

00:50:23
cosmiclasagna: whoever bets closest to the number wins

00:50:24
<transcript>: Not external.

00:50:27
<transcript>: It would be.

00:50:31
<transcript>: Oh, wait, no.

00:50:38
<transcript>: Just send the whole thing in here, right? Because this will handle the no user case.

00:50:40
<transcript>: Go create one.

00:50:44
<transcript>: A little weird, but I'm just going to do that.

00:50:44
<transcript>: so otherwise

00:50:47
goodgrandpaa: @dmmulroy Will do haha! I'm thinking NYC but never thought about Raleigh, might have to look into it! :)

00:50:48
<transcript>: So. Otherwise. Yeah. Here we go.

00:50:48
<transcript>: otherwise

00:50:49
<transcript>: Otherwise.

00:50:49
<transcript>: we do

00:50:51
<transcript>: We do Subscribe.

00:50:55
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:50:58
<transcript>: Sub scribe.

00:50:58
<transcript>: con use

<transcript>: That.

00:51:02
<transcript>: okay

00:51:03
<transcript>: Okay.

00:51:12
<transcript>: We're just going to take them to the checkout page if they click Manage billing, I guess. And they don't have an active stripe account.

00:51:12
<transcript>: oh wait

00:51:14
<transcript>: Oh, wait, no.

00:51:14
<transcript>: if they're not

00:51:25
<transcript>: Status is.

<transcript>: This is so hard look out behind you what happened.

00:51:37
<transcript>: next what is

00:51:39
dmdboi: Dax out here trying to rig the bets

00:51:40
<transcript>: Next? What is it.

00:51:42
dmdboi: GOTTEM

cosmiclasagna: LUL

00:51:47
<transcript>: Oh, how many times Adam gets distracted? That's funny.

00:51:47
<transcript>: you just distract

00:51:51
<transcript>: You just distracted me. Good one got him.

00:51:54
<transcript>: You guys are funny.

00:52:01
cosmiclasagna: HE ACTUALLY looked back

00:52:01
<transcript>: So it's not this because. Okay, here's the deal. If they're not active.

00:52:01
<transcript>: what is

00:52:03
<transcript>: What is the status of it right now.

00:52:08
dmdboi: Its Dax with a steel chair

00:52:08
<transcript>: Is the status canceled.

00:52:13
dmdboi: WWE shit going down

00:52:13
pbertrand_dev: that shelf looks like its about to fall

00:52:14
<transcript>: The thing is they can't resubscribe to products once.

00:52:16
<transcript>: They're in that state.

00:52:25
<transcript>: You guys are funny. Trying to distract me. I'm focused right now.

00:52:25
<transcript>: oh

00:52:29
<transcript>: Oh, it's focused. Anybody remember that.

00:52:35
<transcript>: So.

00:52:44
<transcript>: It's if it's active.

00:52:47
<transcript>: As long as it's not canceled.

00:52:50
<transcript>: Right.

00:52:57
<transcript>: As long as it's not canceled. Maybe.

00:53:04
<transcript>: So if it's canceled.

00:53:09
<transcript>: What did I say? It was? Is it with one L.

00:53:09
<transcript>: canceled

00:53:11
<transcript>: Canceled one L.

00:53:16
<transcript>: Okay. In the case where it's canceled.

00:53:21
<transcript>: We're going to say.

00:53:25
<transcript>: Subscribe like this.

00:53:28
<transcript>: And then.

00:53:30
<transcript>: In the case where.

00:53:36
<transcript>: There is a Customer ID. Stripe, customer ID. I don't care what it is.

00:53:42
<transcript>: Okay.

00:53:44
<transcript>: In that case.

00:53:52
<transcript>: As long as it's not canceled. If it's canceled, we take them to subscribe otherwise.

00:54:01
<transcript>: Check the billing portal and then if they don't have any stripe customer ID, we just send them to subscribe as well. Okay.

00:54:04
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:54:11
<transcript>: Let's try that.

00:54:11
<transcript>: so

00:54:13
<transcript>: So I hit manage billing.

00:54:13
<transcript>: this time

00:54:19
<transcript>: This time it should take me to pay like to buy to buy status right.

00:54:24
<transcript>: No, it should fail. Miserably.

00:54:24
zxshan: @laytanl_ Link LUL

00:54:28
<transcript>: What do we feel about.

00:54:36
<transcript>: No function subscribe. To.

00:54:42
<transcript>: We passed in a connection. And what else.

00:54:46
<transcript>: It's truncated.

00:54:49
<transcript>: Bummer hey, when it's truncated.

00:54:57
<transcript>: Get current user just returns current user Yeah.

00:55:11
<transcript>: It was where? Where did it fail.

00:55:20
<transcript>: 167.

00:55:30
<transcript>: Oh, Con, and then email email.

00:55:41
<transcript>: I'm calling it with Con, and then the user. So what's the problem? Oh, if users nil.

00:55:43
<transcript>: Let's do this.

00:55:46
<transcript>: User.

00:55:56
<transcript>: Okay. So.

00:56:01
<transcript>: If all that fails, we're just going to return an error.

00:56:05
<transcript>: Yes.

00:56:18
<transcript>: I think I think we just return an error.

00:56:21
<transcript>: Let's say.

00:56:25
<transcript>: No user sound I don't know.

00:56:29
<transcript>: Is that right, though? So if there's an email.

00:56:33
<transcript>: We can pass it to Subscribe.

00:56:35
<transcript>: Right.

00:56:39
<transcript>: Let's try that.

00:56:45
<transcript>: Who.

00:56:52
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow that crab language. Enjoyer.

00:56:56

<transcript>: Nothing logged. What.

00:58:21
ohmymndy: canceled is with one "l" ?

00:58:23
<transcript>: What's the problem here? No functional cause subscribe. Yeah, but why didn't we log right here? Manage subscription log.

00:58:28
<transcript>: Cancel this with one. L did I do.

00:58:32
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, it is.

00:58:32
<transcript>: at least

00:58:37
<transcript>: At least in stripe. It is. Isn't that like an English? Different versions of English.

00:58:39
<transcript>: Like.

<transcript>: why is it doing

00:58:41
<transcript>: Why is it doing Subscribe.

00:58:41
<transcript>: for

00:59:33
mattmancodes: it is to me but I'm British

<transcript>: why is it

01:00:46
frixelsnatic: SeemsGood

01:00:47
<transcript>: Why is it? Let's see. What am I missing? Here.

01:00:51
<transcript>: Case.

01:00:51
<transcript>: current user

01:00:58
<transcript>: Current user. It's trying to call subscribe. Oh, because it's canceled it's right here. That's why, of course.

01:00:58
<transcript>: so

01:01:00
<transcript>: So then.

01:01:02
<transcript>: Why is this not valid.

01:01:05
<transcript>: Email, email.

01:01:08
<transcript>: There's a function that matches it's right there.

01:01:11
<transcript>: Connection and email.

gitpush_gitpaid: been in meetings all day

01:01:31
<transcript>: A lot of canceled confusion here.

01:01:39
<transcript>: Yeah. I'm not a big fan of meetings. I try to avoid them if at all costs.

01:01:42
<transcript>: Somebody tell me why Subscribe.

01:01:42
<transcript>: what is wrong

01:01:45
gitpush_gitpaid: did you see it? you know what im talking about

01:01:45
<transcript>: What is wrong with subscribe here.

01:02:03
<transcript>: This requires that the struct has an email right.

01:02:03
<transcript>: happens to

01:02:05
<transcript>: Happens to be a user.

01:02:12
<transcript>: Should I put an overload for subscribe that takes user in.

01:02:28
<transcript>: Did I see what turk? Did I see what meeting.

01:02:28
<transcript>: you talking

01:02:34

01:03:31
gitpush_gitpaid: no meeting lol

01:03:36
<transcript>: No meeting. Oh, got you.

01:03:43
gitpush_gitpaid: theres absolute confusion on whats going on lol

01:03:44
<transcript>: It's unrelated to the meeting conversation. Totally unrelated.

01:03:48
<transcript>: There's absolute confusion.

01:03:52
<transcript>: No. I know what you sent me on Twitter.

01:03:56
<transcript>: Big fan. I mean, I think you're going places.

01:03:58
<transcript>: But what.

01:04:05
<transcript>: Trying to read back what you said here. Did you see it? You know what I'm talking about.

01:04:09
<transcript>: But did I see what.

01:04:16
<transcript>: Subscribe. Con.

01:04:16
<transcript>: user

01:04:17
<transcript>: User.

01:04:21
<transcript>: User is.

01:04:21
<transcript>: oh wait

01:04:23
<transcript>: Oh, wait, should I do.

01:04:29
<transcript>: Maybe this is the problem. Am I not understanding how you unpack the whole thing.

01:04:32
<transcript>: Like I said, equals user there, but.

01:04:32
<transcript>: maybe

01:04:34
<transcript>: Maybe.

01:04:37
<transcript>: That's not how it works.

01:04:41
<transcript>: Let's do this case off.

01:04:41
<transcript>: use

01:04:43
<transcript>: User.

01:04:45

laytanl_: Overlay broken again NotLikeThis

01:04:49
<transcript>: Roll.

01:04:53
gitpush_gitpaid: does the camera auto switch?

01:04:57
<transcript>: I need the actual user. How do I get them.

01:05:05
<transcript>: Overlay broken? What happened to my overlay.

01:05:17
<transcript>: Whoa, Sandrial. I missed a resub. I'm not seeing resubs. Ten months. What.

01:05:17
<transcript>: sunriel

01:05:19
<transcript>: Sunriel? Oh, my word.

01:05:19
<transcript>: ten

01:05:22
<transcript>: Ten months. I've been streaming for ten months.

01:05:22
laytanl_: Yeah subs don't show i guess

01:05:26
<transcript>: You are legitimately one of the first.

01:05:26
<transcript>: subs aren't showing

01:05:28
<transcript>: Subs aren't showing so weird.

01:05:33
<transcript>: Turk, yeah, the camera does auto switch.

01:05:37
<transcript>: I don't know. I can't figure out why I would be missing some events because.

01:05:44
<transcript>: I moved away from the webhooks. Now it's all the Web sarget stuff. So it's weird.

01:05:50
<transcript>: Thank you so much sandrill for being here since the beginning.

01:05:50
<transcript>: of time

01:05:51
<transcript>: Of time.

01:05:51
<transcript>: my time

01:06:00
sondreal: :D

01:06:04
<transcript>: There we go. See User, Yeah, yeah, user.

01:06:11
<transcript>: Okay. What is the problem.

01:06:15
<transcript>: Do I need.

01:06:15
<transcript>: to

01:06:17
<transcript>: To say subscribe needs to.

01:06:17
<transcript>: take in no

01:06:28
<transcript>: Take in no. Because I call this from the front end with just like params. Was it part of like a SubBody on the user or something? Let's do this.

01:06:35
<transcript>: It's going to be this one. Let's do logger info.

01:06:38
<transcript>: No.

01:06:38
<transcript>: logger

01:06:39
dmmulroy: @adamdotdev I launched my first neovim plugin today, would super appreciate a rt for reach if you'd be down: https://twitter.com/dillon_mulroy/status/1650499848305618947?s=20

01:06:41
<transcript>: Logger info.

01:06:43
<transcript>: I need to.

01:06:43
<transcript>: like

01:06:44
<transcript>: Like.

01:06:50
overra_dev: how are you adam

01:06:50
<transcript>: This.

01:06:52
<transcript>: No.

01:06:59
<transcript>: User email. Can I do that.

01:07:04
<transcript>: Map get.

01:07:11
<transcript>: I don't want to do this user email like that. Maybe that'll work.

01:07:16
<transcript>: User email email like that.

01:07:24
<transcript>: Diamoro launched my first neo vin plugin today. It would be Super Pijiv a retweet. You bet you dm. Oy. That's awesome.

01:07:27
<transcript>: Let's just pull it up.

01:07:27
dmmulroy: Thanks man!

01:07:30
<transcript>: You get a retweet.

01:07:30
<transcript>: right

01:07:32
<transcript>: Right here.

01:07:49
<transcript>: I want to read it first because I might want to quote Tweet. It just launched my first new vin plugin. Tse nim? Nvim it brings async project wide typescript type checking diagnostics to any of them async projectwide type strip type. Okay, say goodbye to waiting for build results in a separate terminal. Try it out now.

01:07:49
<transcript>: very

01:07:55
<transcript>: Very cool. I'm just going to tweet it because I don't know what I would say. I'm not smart enough to twote tweet it, but Wow.

01:07:55
<transcript>: this

01:07:56
<transcript>: This is awesome.

01:08:08
<transcript>: Is your first one to launch? Have you been like, is this your first time playing around with the neo vm plugin ecosystem? Or you just hadn't published the ones in the past.

01:08:12
<transcript>: This is super cool. And sounds complicated.

01:08:21
<transcript>: I need to actually go fuzzy real quick, and I need to you're so welcome. Ovara, I'm good. How are you? I got to go find.

01:08:25
sockthedev: @dmmulroy I just tried it out, but it expects `tsc` to be available globally. any chance to use the local installed package?

01:08:30
<transcript>: Things okay.

01:08:33
dmmulroy: I have a few small things that could be plugins but this was the first that I actually turned into a legit plugin

01:08:34
<transcript>: Do unfuzzy.

01:08:34
<transcript>: cool

01:08:35
<transcript>: Cool.

01:08:45
dmmulroy: @sockthedev Oh that's a good thought, I'll work on that tonight

01:08:47
warpple: that fuzzying the screen is pretty cool

01:08:50
<transcript>: I just tried it out, but it expects tsc to be available globally. Any chance to use the local install package? I have a few small things that could be plugins, but this was the first one that I actually turned into a legit plugin. So cool, diamoroi. I want to make a plugin.

01:08:50
<transcript>: but

01:09:01
<transcript>: But I want to make it for dumb reasons. For, like, a YouTube video. I want to make like, a very painful Neil vim plugin that doesn't allow me to delete anything out of a buffer so you can only go forward.

01:09:03
<transcript>: Like.

01:09:03
<transcript>: no delet

01:09:05
sockthedev: awesome, ty 💜

01:09:12
<transcript>: No deleting undoing. It's only like entering things into the buffer. And I'm going to try and create an app with it. It's going to be so painful. It's going to be fun to watch, though.

01:09:18
<transcript>: Like if you add too much, you got to figure out how to make it work. Syntactically in your language.

01:09:18
<transcript>: i guess

01:09:20
<transcript>: I guess just comment it out.

01:09:20
<transcript>: but i feel

01:09:25
<transcript>: But I feel like there could be some scenario where you get into a state and you just have to leave the whole buffer and start over.

01:09:29
<transcript>: It's going to be great.

01:09:29
<transcript>: but that's just

01:09:35
<transcript>: But that's just like meming. That's not even like a real plugin. But I thought it'd be a good way to learn it.

01:09:35
<transcript>: i'm so

01:09:43
kylel2p: I don’t want to derail you from the Stripe train, but can you give any insight into how Statmuse collected so much sports data? I’m building a daily fantasy sports app and am currently looking for a stats provider

01:09:44
<transcript>: I'm so proud of you. That's a whole world I have not entered into lua. It's lua. Right. Oh. Did I test this? I saved this.

01:09:44
<transcript>: did i test

01:09:46
<transcript>: Did I test it.

01:09:53
<transcript>: That fuzzing the screen is pretty cool. Thanks warple.

01:09:54
dmmulroy: Yeah lua makes writing plugins a breeze

01:09:56
<transcript>: That was something that.

01:09:56
<transcript>: rocks

01:10:00
<transcript>: Rocks I stole from Rocks internal server error.

01:10:07
<transcript>: I don't want to derail you from the stripe train, but can you give any insight into how Stapmy's collected so much force data building a daily.

01:10:07
<transcript>: fantasy

01:10:11
adamdotdev: !data

01:10:11
fossabot: StatMuse gets real-time data from SportRadar, but all the historical data was collected by Justin Kubatko, creator of Basketball-Reference.com, who worked as the lead statistician for Statmuse for several years. Read more here: https://www.statmuse.com/product/data

01:10:16
<transcript>: Fantasy Sports app. And I'm currently looking for a stats provider. You betcha, Kyle. I think I've got a thing right there for you. There you go.

01:10:19
<transcript>: Okay.

01:10:19
<transcript>: let me

01:10:22
<transcript>: Let me know if you have any questions after reading that.

01:10:28
<transcript>: Okay.

01:10:28
<transcript>: fetch

01:10:32

01:10:34
kylel2p: Thank you!

01:10:37

<transcript>: Users does not influence oh, can I not do.

01:10:49
dmdboi: He's learning

01:10:50
<transcript>: The atom the way I did it, I can't access the property.

01:10:50
<transcript>: that's fine

01:10:51
<transcript>: That's fine.

01:10:51
<transcript>: can i access

01:10:53
<transcript>: Can I access it like.

01:10:53
<transcript>: this

01:10:56
<transcript>: This map. Git.

01:10:56
<transcript>: use

01:10:58
<transcript>: User.

01:10:58
<transcript>: email

01:11:10
<transcript>: Email. I'm just trying to confirm that this thing has an email at the top level. And I'm not misunderstanding how this struct is. I guess I could go to now, where else would it be? Of course.

01:11:13
<transcript>: Does this have to be.

01:11:15
<transcript>: Let me do this. Let me just do this.

01:11:19
daglee: @dmmulroy Depends on what you do in your plugin!

01:11:20
<transcript>: Def. Subscribe. This may be a misunderstanding of how.

01:11:23
<transcript>: It works.

01:11:30
<transcript>: How do I do this.

01:11:33
<transcript>: Like that.

01:11:40
<transcript>: Maybe a misunderstanding of elixir. Is that how I would say it's got to be a user.

01:11:45
<transcript>: That looks wrong, but basically I'm going to return Subscribe.

01:11:48
<transcript>: Con. Yeah. Just like that.

01:11:55
<transcript>: But is that accurate? Or is that like valid syntax? You may know elixir here.

01:11:58
<transcript>: Look at Adam. Remember to use his commands. That's right.

01:11:58
<transcript>: dm bo

01:12:00
<transcript>: Dm. Bowl.

01:12:02
<transcript>: Depends on what you do in your plugin.

01:12:07
dmmulroy: Hahah true

01:12:10
<transcript>: Somebody tell me if this is valid. Elixir. I guess it is. It's not yelling at me.

01:12:13
<transcript>: Will this work? Now.

01:12:18
<transcript>: Will this work? Now let's try.

01:12:21
<transcript>: Okay.

01:12:21
<transcript>: i've got

01:12:29
<transcript>: I've got a little bit here. Got 30 minutes before I need to bring on a guest. Int. 82 thank you so much for that. Follow.

01:12:32
<transcript>: I need to get some stuff done.

01:12:32
<transcript>: i'll probably just

01:12:41
<transcript>: I'll probably just have the guests on for like an hour. We will not be doing any pair programming or anything like that. Just be hanging out and talking network air.

01:12:41
<transcript>: it says

01:12:43
gitpush_gitpaid: did you announce who the guest was

01:12:47
<transcript>: It says response from stripe headers. Okay, so that worked. No, it didn't. User email is empty.

01:12:50
<transcript>: What.

01:12:51
laytanl_: I've made a couple of plugins but the standard library of Lua is really lacking

01:12:51
<transcript>: That's the problem.

01:12:55
<transcript>: The email is not at the top level, like I thought it was.

01:13:00
<transcript>: So where is it.

01:13:05
<transcript>: Here mothra user.

01:13:05
<transcript>: username

01:13:10
<transcript>: Username here's email down here. If it's not the top level, where is it.

01:13:24
<transcript>: Is it not a map? Did map get network because it's not a map.

01:13:33
<transcript>: No, turk, I didn't. It's just gonna I'm just gonna have them on just gonna be like tada.

01:13:43
<transcript>: Tada it's one of my heroes though I'm meeting one of my heroes today I've made a couple of plugins with standard library. Blueout is really lacking.

01:13:46
<transcript>: I'm annoyed.

01:13:48
<transcript>: Why am I annoyed.

01:13:54
<transcript>: Also, why did it read it? Didn't redirect.

01:13:55
mattmancodes: I'm guessing it's Dax

01:13:56
<transcript>: Give a network error.

01:14:01
<transcript>: Tax that'd be funny.

01:14:04
<transcript>: How funny would that be.

01:14:15
<transcript>: So why does this redirect not work? Oh, because I'm supposed to return it in a url.

01:14:17
<transcript>: Oh, why.

01:14:20
<transcript>: Is this one different.

01:14:29
<transcript>: Oh, because this one actually had to have the user session. That's right. I learned that. Yeah. Okay.

01:14:32
laytanl_: Dax isn't even a guest anymore he just turns up

01:14:35
<transcript>: Bummer.

01:14:37
<transcript>: I had to.

01:14:42
<transcript>: Let's see. Subscribe.

01:14:42
<transcript>: i need to not

01:14:43
<transcript>: I need to not.

01:14:45
<transcript>: Redirect.

01:14:45
<transcript>: i

01:14:48
<transcript>: I can just reuse. This is the problem.

01:14:51
<transcript>: Such a bummer.

01:14:56
<transcript>: But maybe it's best this way because I don't even know where the email is.

01:15:05
beganovich76: hi!

01:15:09
<transcript>: Hello.

01:15:09
<transcript>: beganovich

01:15:12
<transcript>: Beganovich. Thank you for the follow. Welcome to chat.

01:15:12
<transcript>: both of

01:15:16
<transcript>: Both of them both all at once. You did it all at once.

01:15:18
<transcript>: Welcome.

01:15:25
<transcript>: What a bummer. El Costa. Thank you for the follow.

01:15:33
cosmiclasagna: he'll turn up in a big way once he gets his revenge

01:15:36
<transcript>: So I'm just gonna be copying code, I guess. Just like this.

01:15:48
<transcript>: Feels bad, but I don't know. So URL I'm going to pass the user success callback. I'm going to have to copy all this. I don't care. This whole code base is throwaway.

01:15:48
<transcript>: so i don't

01:15:49
beganovich76: nice to see someone using a framework that doesn't require ton  of gluing LUL

01:15:49
<transcript>: So I don't care.

01:15:53
<transcript>: We're literally rewriting the entire thing.

01:15:56
<transcript>: So callback.

01:16:00
<transcript>: Success callback.

01:16:04
<transcript>: So if they succeed.

01:16:04
<transcript>: in

01:16:06
<transcript>: In Managing subscription.

01:16:16
<transcript>: We want to take them back to account.

01:16:22
<transcript>: And then on this one if they cancel.

01:16:22
<transcript>: i don't know

01:16:24
<transcript>: I don't know. I think it's also.

01:16:26
<transcript>: Count.

01:16:36
<transcript>: Just going to leave them separate variables. Success, callback, cancel. Callback. Okay, so we have a url. Is that right.

01:16:40
<transcript>: And then we're going to say this.

01:16:43
<transcript>: Like that.

01:16:47
<transcript>: That's what we do there.

01:16:47
<transcript>: and then

01:16:51
<transcript>: And then here as well, if they have an email.

01:16:53
<transcript>: Wait. What.

01:16:53
<transcript>: i

01:16:55
<transcript>: I do this again.

01:17:03
<transcript>: I don't remember why I did this.

01:17:07
<transcript>: I guess.

01:17:10
<transcript>: I could reverse these and say.

01:17:12
<transcript>: Nil.

01:17:18
<transcript>: And then this is just.

01:17:20
<transcript>: You.

01:17:20
<transcript>: like

01:17:23
<transcript>: Like that. Okay.

01:17:23
<transcript>: stripe

01:17:27
<transcript>: Stripe crit checkout session. That all. Sounds fine.

01:17:29
<transcript>: Okay.

01:17:29
<transcript>: sounds fine

01:17:31
<transcript>: Sounds fine. Let's see if it works.

01:17:34
<transcript>: Nice to see someone.

01:17:34
<transcript>: using

01:17:37
<transcript>: Using a framework that doesn't require a ton of gluing.

01:17:43
<transcript>: Yeah, well, we're in the middle of rewriting this entire code base. So.

01:17:43
<transcript>: i care

01:17:49
<transcript>: I care very little about the code quality and all that stuff. Okay. So it took us to stripe checkout. That's good. This is perfect.

01:17:49
<transcript>: if i go

01:17:51
<transcript>: If I go back.

01:18:03
<transcript>: Here. So Manage billing if they're not subscribed the Manage Billing button. So if they've canceled and it's expired, we just take them to a new checkout session and they can become a subscriber all over again. Right.

01:18:06
<transcript>: Okay. Let's see if it works.

01:18:11
<transcript>: Let's see if it works.

01:18:15
<transcript>: Subscribe.

01:18:24
<transcript>: He'll turn up in a big way once he gets his revenge. Yeah, I'm sure he will. I'm sure dax is planning something. He's plotting and scheming.

01:18:32
<transcript>: It should be the same customer. I would hope we'll see if it was okay. And it takes me back here. Great.

01:18:34
beganovich76: why elixir?

01:18:39
<transcript>: Maybe I should show the status. I'm not going to do it yet, but maybe I could show like if your subscription is active.

01:18:42
<transcript>: I don't know stuff like that.

01:18:45
<transcript>: Let's go back to manage billing.

01:18:45
<transcript>: make sure

01:18:47
<transcript>: Make sure that's working.

01:18:51
<transcript>: Yeah, cool.

01:18:56
<transcript>: Can cancel, but I'm not going to let's go back here. Let's look at this customer.

01:18:56
<transcript>: over

01:18:58
<transcript>: Overview.

01:19:02
<transcript>: Canceled. Oh, did it create a new customer.

01:19:06
<transcript>: Bomber.

01:19:11
<transcript>: It created a new customer, didn't it? Sure did.

01:19:17
<transcript>: I wonder why I guess I probably have to manually.

01:19:27
<transcript>: I don't want it to do that. I want to clean that up a little bit. I think I can. I can fix this. So the way I'm going to fix it is in the ssd code, actually.

01:19:30
<transcript>: Here. We're going to say.

01:19:38
<transcript>: Let's see manage. Checkout. So in checkout you can pass a customer ID. How about that.

01:19:42
<transcript>: If you pass a Customer ID.

01:19:50
<transcript>: Customer Email by Email If you do if you pass a Customer ID. Customer.

01:19:53
<transcript>: Going to be Body Customer ID.

01:19:53
<transcript>: so

01:19:57
<transcript>: So this is a way to keep it as an existing customer.

01:20:01
<transcript>: Cool. So then over here.

01:20:01
<transcript>: i can

01:20:02
<transcript>: I can say.

01:20:16
<transcript>: Let's see Create checkout session. This code needs to accommodate a Customer ID customer ID User stripe Customer ID cool.

01:20:20
<transcript>: Right. Yeah.

01:20:23
<transcript>: Is it going to be nil? What's it going to be if it doesn't exist.

01:20:32
<transcript>: I need to safely get that.

01:20:37
<transcript>: How do I safely access this out of this user model.

01:20:41
<transcript>: Beganovich. Why elixir.

01:20:41
<transcript>: we originally wrote

01:20:50
<transcript>: We originally wrote it in elixir because we had a dev that we hired that really loved elixir, and he was the main person going to be building it. So we said, run with it.

01:20:50
<transcript>: and it's fine

01:20:54
<transcript>: And it's fine. I mean, it's fine enough for a web project like this.

01:20:54
<transcript>: welcome

01:20:58
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Or. I'm sorry. Thank you for the Follow Lewis.

01:21:00

01:21:00
<transcript>: thank you for

01:21:02
<transcript>: Thank you for that. Follow.

01:21:07
<transcript>: I don't think this is going to work if they don't have a stripe customer ID, is it.

01:21:07
mattmancodes: Ooh DoseOne

01:21:13
mattmancodes: Didn't expect that

01:21:14
<transcript>: Maybe it will. If it will, then that's great. But I think I need to safely access it.

01:21:17
<transcript>: It's not map get.

01:21:19
<transcript>: What is it.

01:21:25
<transcript>: How do I safely get the thing out.

01:21:33
<transcript>: Just try it. I'm going to see if it works.

01:21:47
<transcript>: Dose. One didn't expect that.

01:21:53
beganovich76: i usually zod stuff like this

01:22:00
<transcript>: Usually zodia. I guess I should have zotted.

01:22:11
<transcript>: Add free experience to get that in there. We're going to say Test 22.

01:22:15
<transcript>: I think we're going to follow Sage.

01:22:20
gitpush_gitpaid: @beganovich76 you again... everyone ignore beganovich. lol jk

01:22:20
<transcript>: Uhoh.

01:22:20

01:22:31
<transcript>: Everyone ignored boganovich. What.

01:22:31
<transcript>: why are we

01:22:33
<transcript>: Why are we ignoring them.

01:23:22
<transcript>: So I need to say.

01:23:24
<transcript>: Customer.

01:23:28
<transcript>: I wonder what customer was though actually.

01:23:33
<transcript>: Console.

01:23:35
<transcript>: Log.

01:23:37
<transcript>: Null.

01:23:40
<transcript>: Based on stringify.

01:23:42

<transcript>: and then

01:24:54
<transcript>: And then the email.

01:24:54
<transcript>: would similar

01:24:58
<transcript>: Would similarly be Body Customer ID.

01:25:01
<transcript>: Undefined.

01:25:03
<transcript>: Okay. Just like that.

01:25:05
<transcript>: Six.

<transcript>: Let's get rid of this.

01:25:13
<transcript>: Here we go.

01:25:17
<transcript>: I don't remember what I'm testing now.

01:25:20
<transcript>: Test 24.

01:25:21

01:25:53
<transcript>: thank you

01:25:56
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow gnb.

01:26:03
<transcript>: What am I testing again.

01:26:03
<transcript>: i'm going to test

01:26:07
<transcript>: I'm going to test that everything still works. I didn't just break it all.

01:26:09
gitpush_gitpaid: finally out of meetings until 1... god its been so much

01:26:11
<transcript>: We're going to cancel it. That's right. We're going to cancel.

01:26:21
<transcript>: Yeah, turk, you need to stop the meeting thing. What do you got to do to stop having so many meetings? Sounds awful.

01:26:21
<transcript>: go to

01:26:25

beganovich76: full-time zoom developer

01:27:02
gitpush_gitpaid: this last meeting was a meeting to discuss the topics for the upcoming meeting. what.

01:27:05
heyglassy: Wowee

01:27:14
<transcript>: Now we're no longer an active user or we don't have a paid account anymore. So when we go to manage billing, it should sell us, should take us to checkout. But look at that. It's got our card and everything subscribe because it's existing customer perfect. I didn't even know it was going to make the experience better.

01:27:14
<transcript>: wonderful

01:27:15
<transcript>: Wonderful.

01:27:18
<transcript>: Love it.

01:27:25
<transcript>: You're welcome? Greetings from Argentina, gnb welcome to Chat greetings from America.

01:27:27
sockthedev: so glad to see you have a reasonable cancel process. i hate this trend you see on subscription services where their cancel workflow almost tries to trick you into not cancelling.

01:27:29
suprememastertv_rosidae0: do you have a seperate chrome account for streaming so you dont leak stuff? i could never stream because i would be so scared of leaking stuff

01:27:30
<transcript>: Everyone needs to turn everything into a meeting here. Yeah, there's a lot of that going around.

01:27:35
<transcript>: Hey, Glassy, what's going on? Glassy.

01:27:48
suprememastertv_rosidae0: also do you still remember me? :)

01:27:50
gitpush_gitpaid: i missed everything. how are you storing the info for the user? the stripe id?

01:27:55
<transcript>: The last meeting was a meeting to discuss the topics for the upcoming meeting. Oh, jeez, so glad to see you have a reasonable cancel process. I hate this trend you see on subscription service cancel workflow almost tries to trick you into. Yeah, no, we're not doing that. Sock. Just click cancel if you don't want it, we don't care. Do you have a separate Chrome account for streaming? So.

01:27:55
<transcript>: you don't leak stuff

01:27:56
dmdboi: A meeting about a meeting

01:27:58
bonnjaevel: Greetings from Sweden

01:27:59
<transcript>: You don't leak stuff I can never stream because I would be slipscribing stuff.

01:27:59
<transcript>: so no

01:28:14
<transcript>: So no, this is just a stat muse Chrome profile. So it has a status stuff already. You just do leak stuff. It just happens and then you have to deal with it. I do a little better now than I used to, but yeah, it just happens.

01:28:18
<transcript>: And hopefully you don't leak anything too painful.

01:28:21
<transcript>: Also, do you still remember me.

01:28:25
<transcript>: Rosade, I think I remember you.

01:28:25
<transcript>: has your username change

01:28:27
<transcript>: Has your username changed.

01:28:27
<transcript>: rosie

01:28:30
<transcript>: Rosie, did I call you Rosie.

01:28:31
gitpush_gitpaid: the stripe id is stored with the user profile in your db?

01:28:40
<transcript>: I hadn't seen you since before. I took my big break. Have I? I missed everything. How are you storing the info for the user? The stripe ID. I just saw this. Yeah. Stripe. Customer ID. That's right.

01:28:46
<transcript>: Greetings from Sweden welcome bonja from Sweden.

01:28:46
<transcript>: aksh

<transcript>: the stripe

01:28:52
enzujp: Hey Adam! Watched your Twitter videos for a while, and wanted to come watch you on Twitch. Great stuff!

01:28:53
<transcript>: The stripe ID is stored with user profile on your db. Yes, exactly. Git push that's right.

01:28:53
<transcript>: okay

01:28:59
suprememastertv_rosidae0: Ion_IoI

01:29:01
<transcript>: Okay. Everything's working for the manage billing case. I need to do the update email, and I need to do delete my account.

01:29:11
<transcript>: I need to put a big banner at the top of the site that's, like upgrade status, pro it's a thing or status plus.

01:29:11
suprememastertv_rosidae0: sorry for late response i got stream delay lol

01:29:17
dmdboi: The MacBook is definitely a scam

01:29:18
<transcript>: Lawn. Of course, I remember lawn.

01:29:18
<transcript>: no

01:29:25
<transcript>: No worries. Yeah, of course I remember you. Your username is very different. So I did not know that new username.

01:29:38
<transcript>: Inzlip welcome to Chat. Watch your Twitter videos for a while and wanted to come watch on twitch. Thanks so much for joining. I have made a lot of those Twitter videos. A bunch of them. I got a huge folder of them. You want to see the folder of them.

01:29:42
gitpush_gitpaid: do you have to do anything with that id? like what if someone got a hold of someone elses stripe id?

01:29:45
<transcript>: I got a bunch of them. Like, look at these. These are all the Twitter videos I've made.

01:29:45
heyglassy: the twitter videos are awesome

01:29:47
<transcript>: 98 of them.

01:29:47
<transcript>: almost

01:29:48
heyglassy: so many good memes

01:29:51
<transcript>: Almost done 100 ooh. I should do like a special 100.

01:29:52
heyglassy: also good advice

01:29:54
<transcript>: Anyway.

01:29:57
<transcript>: I do those every time I go live.

01:30:00
<transcript>: Have I only streamed 100 times? Is that right.

01:30:06
<transcript>: Thanks so much glassy. I appreciate that.

01:30:06
<transcript>: do you have to do anything

01:30:12
suprememastertv_rosidae0: the suprememastertv part is an inside joke but ive changed from Ion_IoI to rosidae0 and you can call me rosi

01:30:16
<transcript>: Do you have to do anything with that ID? Like what if someone got a hold of someone else's stripe ID? I don't think it's sensitive, turk. I don't think so. The macbook is definitely a scam. It's not a scam.

01:30:25
dmdboi: Prove it's not a scam Adam

01:30:28
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm not sure. I'm not sure if the stripe ID is sensitive. I don't think you could do anything with it. A Stripe Customer ID. The Supreme Master TV part is an inside joke, but I've changed from lawn.

01:30:28
<transcript>: to

01:30:30
gitpush_gitpaid: but if its not sensitive how does the card get autofilled?

01:30:39
<transcript>: To Roseade. And you can call me rosie. Got it, rosie. I will call you rosie. Prove it's not a scam. Well, I'll just watch me win it. Wouldn't that be hilarious.

01:30:41
<transcript>: Oh, he's so funny if I won.

01:30:42
dmmulroy: stripe customer ids are unique to your account and aren't sensitive

01:30:45
<transcript>: Oh, it's taking a bit. What's going on here.

01:30:56
<transcript>: I'm trying to redeem it, but it's not working. Maybe in the other tab.

01:30:59
gitpush_gitpaid: @dmmulroy but how would stripe know?

01:31:01
<transcript>: Not sensitive. Cool.

01:31:05
<transcript>: Didn't win.

01:31:09
<transcript>: Somebody's going to win one of these days, and I'll send.

01:31:09
<transcript>: like

01:31:10
dmdboi: *wins it*

01:31:16
<transcript>: Like photographic evidence. I'll video me handing it to the Ups man. How about that? Wins it? That'd be so funny.

01:31:20
dmdboi: Video you hand delivering it

01:31:22
<transcript>: If it's not sensitive, how does the card get auto filled.

01:31:24
dmmulroy: You issue api requests with a client using your API key, they'll only exist if you send a request w/ the key

01:31:37
<transcript>: My connection to stripe is sensitive. So if I say like I have a trusted relationship with stripe through the api it's server to server. And if I say this, create a session for this customer.

01:31:37
<transcript>: then

01:31:42
<transcript>: Then they're taking that authenticated session that I have through the API.

01:31:42
<transcript>: as

01:31:44
<transcript>: As authority to create.

01:31:44
<transcript>: a checkout

01:31:47
<transcript>: A checkout session for that customer. Does that make sense.

01:31:48
dmmulroy: Adam just explained it better

01:31:50
<transcript>: Yeah, exactly.

01:31:50
<transcript>: so

01:31:54
<transcript>: So somebody else can't go in and do the same.

01:32:04
<transcript>: I don't do any stripe api calls from the browser. You can there's stripe public publishable ID or whatever.

01:32:04
<transcript>: there's

01:32:10
<transcript>: There's like stripe js. You can do browser stuff. I do all mine server to service so all mine is on the back end.

01:32:14
<transcript>: Like I don't make stripe calls from the browser.

01:32:14
<transcript>: video

01:32:21
alexandersupertramp29: can you link the website?

01:32:23
<transcript>: Video. You hand delivering it. Yeah. I'll travel to wherever somebody in South Africa wins it. I'm like flying South Africa. How fun would that be? Okay.

01:32:23
beganovich76: what if someone steals your server details LUL

01:32:28
<transcript>: Can you link the website? You mean samus.

01:32:31
adamdotdev: https://www.statmuse.com

01:32:31
<transcript>: Like this one.

01:32:31
<transcript>: news

01:32:33
alexandersupertramp29: yes thanks!

01:32:34
<transcript>: News.com? Or do you mean a different website.

01:32:35
dmdboi: Even better, livestream it

01:32:38
<transcript>: But if someone steals your server details, well, then, yeah, you're in trouble.

01:32:45
gitpush_gitpaid: yea i get that. i just wonder if theres any checks for if the stirpe id is indeed who the user says they are. my wording/question sucks but i mean lets say your stripe id is 123... is there any check if i try to use stripe id 123

01:32:46
sockthedev: south africa is actually a choice holiday location if you haven't been

01:32:46
<transcript>: At that point, you're screwed. Yeah, not much it can add and not much we can go right there? Somebody has your secrets.

01:32:46
<transcript>: i mean

01:32:49
rollie042: I want to redeem for the macbook, but I don't want a macbook - I just want to have won it

01:32:59
gitpush_gitpaid: like if i make a req with 123

01:33:03
<transcript>: I mean, you can rotate them, but if you don't know that they have them, it's not good. I get that. I just wonder if there's any checks for if the stripe idea is indeed who the user says they are. My wording question sucks. But I mean let's say your stripe ID is one, two, three. Is there any check if I try to use stripe ID? One, two, three.

01:33:05
<transcript>: Well, you.

01:33:18
<transcript>: Can't use stripe ID. One, two, three. Like I'm status as a user of stat muse, you're not able to make any calls to my stripe api directly.

01:33:19
rollie042: Probably if you as a dev used stripe id 123, you'd allow a user to pay Adam

01:33:20
<transcript>: Does that make sense.

01:33:31
<transcript>: South Africa is actually a choice holiday location if you haven't been.

01:33:43
<transcript>: I have not been sock. I've not been many places outside of the ozarks. I want to redeem for the macbook, but I don't want a macbook. I just want to have won it. Well, try and win it. You can always sell it on ebay or something.

01:33:52
gitpush_gitpaid: @rollie042 thats what i mean

01:33:54
<transcript>: If you get so when you Turk when you say if you make a request do you mean like me? In this case the status back end.

01:33:54
<transcript>: is that

01:33:56
<transcript>: Is that what you mean.

01:33:56
<transcript>: probably

01:34:00
<transcript>: Probably if you as a devs, you stripe. One, two, three.

01:34:00
<transcript>: yeah

01:34:01
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:34:07
<transcript>: You could pass in the wrong stripe customer ID. That would be bad. Don't do that.

01:34:11
<transcript>: Like I could give a different customer access to the wrong.

01:34:11
beganovich76: @gitpush_gitpaid i think point is that you a) can't access the key b) can't make request to the api with secret key + customer id.. because there's no way you can know both or change it, i guess?

01:34:16
<transcript>: Session. I could don't do that.

01:34:22
enzujp: What song is playing in the backgroune

01:34:22
gitpush_gitpaid: so ok... so lets say dax stripe id is 123..... i use id 123 to make a req. id essentially be charging dax no?

01:34:24
<transcript>: You a can't access the key. B can't make requests to the api with secret keeper because there's no way. Yeah.

01:34:24
<transcript>: it's secure

01:34:33
enzujp: background*

01:34:37
<transcript>: It's secure, but you could, as a developer, screw up and pass the wrong customer ID in and give somebody access to that'd be bad. I wonder what kind of checks are there in place for that? I guess there's nothing. I don't know. None.

01:34:42
dmdboi: I think Stripe has some fraud detection stuff

01:34:44
<transcript>: So let's say DAX stripe ideas. One, two, three. I use ID. One, two, three. To make a request. Id essentially be charging DAX.

01:34:44
<transcript>: now

01:34:48
<transcript>: Now. Yeah. They have some fraud detection stuff. Yeah.

01:34:53
<transcript>: I think it would get sorted out and people would probably not use your service again.

01:34:56
<transcript>: If they got screwed like that.

01:34:59
<transcript>: What song is playing in the background.

01:35:02
beganovich76: but also dax will be getting the stuff dax paid for?

01:35:03
<transcript>: It's down there in the bottom, right corner of my stream. Do you see.

01:35:03
<transcript>: the

01:35:08
<transcript>: The it shows it right there in the bottom corner. This is foles 2001.

01:35:08
<transcript>: see that

01:35:09
<transcript>: See that.

01:35:12
gitpush_gitpaid: thats what i was getting to. are you doing checks in the backend like if the profile email and etc... matches the stripe profile email?

01:35:13
<transcript>: The song that's currently playing is always right there.

01:35:18
<transcript>: But also dax will be getting this stuff. Dax paid for.

01:35:34
<transcript>: Oh, that's what you're getting to. Are you doing checks in the back end? Like if the profile email, et cetera. Matches the stripe profile email. So no, because they could change their email, they could have a different email in stripe than they do on their.

01:35:34
<transcript>: stat

01:35:38
<transcript>: Status account. There's no reason they have to have the same email.

01:35:39
dmdboi: If I use your ID and they're like "why did Adam from the Ozarks pay for this from North England" they're gonna be sus

01:35:47
<transcript>: So I'm just storing the stripe customer ID on that user's user record based on the session the logged in session.

01:35:47
<transcript>: and

01:35:53
gitpush_gitpaid: well can you store any other info on stripe thatll make sure the accounts match?

01:35:55
<transcript>: And if they try to check out again, I just pull it from the database and use that again. So I feel pretty good about how I've done it.

01:36:02
<transcript>: But why did Adam from the ozarks pay for this from North England? They're going to be sus.

01:36:02
<transcript>: can you store

01:36:06
<transcript>: Can you store any other info on stripe that'll make sure the accounts match.

01:36:17
<transcript>: Called a client reference ID, which is the user's ID. Oh, yeah, I could do. Okay. So you're saying I should probably double check that.

01:36:21
<transcript>: How would I do that.

01:36:23
gitpush_gitpaid: yea thats what i mean

01:36:24
<transcript>: So back here in this code.

01:36:28
<transcript>: Handle checkout session completed.

01:36:28
<transcript>: no

01:36:30
<transcript>: No, I'm in the wrong place.

01:36:30
<transcript>: here

01:36:31
<transcript>: Here.

01:36:36
<transcript>: So when we create a checkout session.

01:36:36
<transcript>: customer id

01:36:40
<transcript>: Customer ID is stripe, Customer ID, and then User ids. User ID.

01:36:43
<transcript>: We could say.

01:36:47
gitpush_gitpaid: like if the user id matches the stored id with stripe before making a charge

01:36:52
<transcript>: I mean, it's all on the same data record, so I don't know what the check. The check would feel kind of pointless, like the check would be.

01:36:52
<transcript>: if

01:36:52
gitpush_gitpaid: yea i guess

01:36:59
<transcript>: If the user ID matches the stored ID with stripe before making a chain a charge. Yeah, I'd just be checking that the user ID right here.

01:37:02
<transcript>: Equals.

01:37:08
<transcript>: I guess like I could fetch the stripe customer and make sure.

01:37:08
<transcript>: it's not even

01:37:11
<transcript>: It's not even the customer. It's the session. It's the checkout setion.

01:37:16
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm not sure. Turk. There might be something here. There might be.

01:37:16
<transcript>: a thing i could

01:37:19
<transcript>: A thing I could do to be safer.

01:37:22
<transcript>: I'm not sure what it would be yet.

01:37:25
<transcript>: Not sure.

01:37:30
<transcript>: But I don't think there's any way that this gets mixed up.

01:37:31
bishopdev: @adamdotdev would you review some code ? I had this get in the door challenge for a job .. and got some shit feedback

01:37:35
<transcript>: Short of somebody manually updating the database.

01:37:36
beganovich76: im not sure i even see the issue tbh

01:37:46
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't see the issue, but I'm trying to think if there's some way to put a check in here.

01:37:46
<transcript>: bishop would you

01:37:52
<transcript>: Bishop, would you re review some code? I had this get in the door challenge for a job and got some bad feedback.

01:37:52
<transcript>: bishop

01:37:53
<transcript>: Bishop.

01:37:53
<transcript>: yes

01:37:54
<transcript>: Yes.

01:38:02
<transcript>: In fact, let's do it right now. I've just got, like, five minutes before I need to get my guests on. So let's do it.

01:38:02
alexandersupertramp29: what web framework this website use?

01:38:04
<transcript>: What do you got.

01:38:04
<transcript>: just

01:38:05
bishopdev: https://github.com/oviava/battleships-task/tree/main

01:38:09
<transcript>: Just got gist or some other public code I can look at we'll do it right now.

01:38:12
<transcript>: What.

01:38:12
<transcript>: web framework

01:38:19
bishopdev: https://github.com/oviava/battleships-task/blob/main/src/Battleships.tsx

01:38:20
<transcript>: Web framework this site uses. The existing site is an elixir Phoenix app with React stuff. It's just a bunch of stuff.

01:38:24
<transcript>: We're rewriting it in an astro. Okay, here we go.

01:38:24
<transcript>: tree

01:38:26
heyglassy: whats the tech stack of statmuse?

01:38:28
<transcript>: Tree github battleships Copy link.

01:38:28
<transcript>: let's just

01:38:30
<transcript>: Let's just open it right here.

01:38:34
<transcript>: And what is the second one.

01:38:44
<transcript>: Copy link. I think I just answered your question too. Glassy. You both just asked what the stack was. Same time.

01:38:46
<transcript>: Okay.

01:38:49
heyglassy: ah LUL

01:38:51
<transcript>: So what is this? First one? Is this just telling me what the task is.

01:38:51
<transcript>: i'm implemented partial

01:38:52
bishopdev: there's a readme with the challenge

01:38:54
<transcript>: I'm implemented partial battleship game as web app.

01:39:02
gitpush_gitpaid: you know what you havent answered? why havent you updated your browser that you said you would last week

01:39:02
<transcript>: Read me with the challenge. Got it. Okay, battleship Game is a web app and Battleship Computer is positioned faster. I know how Battleship works.

01:39:15
<transcript>: Players fires in a board position. Obviously, the game would be more fun as a player at his own ships and the computer were firing back. But we'll leave that out for simplicity. In other words, we're only implementing the turns for player one, not for player two.

01:39:15
<transcript>: okay

01:39:35
<transcript>: Okay. You may use a provide json data indicating position of ships. The game should be responsive, mobile friendly so that it may be played on an iphone screen size up to a desktop. You need to use reaction typescript for the implementation. You may feel free to use redux less or any other library you think is suitable for the project. It's not necessary to say Game state or anything like that. Please create a new branch.

01:39:35
<transcript>: from main

01:39:40
<transcript>: From Main and Open Pull request to Main upon completion completion, you may push as many Commission.

01:39:40
<transcript>: no

01:40:00
<transcript>: No need to squash them. Ship layout, data, ship types, carrier, battleship, cruiser, submarine destroyer. Okay, it's got size. And then how many of them you have? Layout, ship carrier positions. Okay, so showing you how it's laid out. Yes. And then this is what your building. You have to build something in react to be able to play the game just like this.

01:40:00
<transcript>: okay

01:40:03
<transcript>: Okay. I got it.

01:40:03
<transcript>: i got it

01:40:05
<transcript>: I got it. Now let's look. Your code.

01:40:16
<transcript>: You know what? You have an answered. Why haven't you updated your browser that you said you would last week? You know what, turk? I say I'm going to do a lot of things.

01:40:16
<transcript>: that i don't end

01:40:22
<transcript>: That I don't end up doing when they're things like updating browsers. I just don't lose all my tabs, that's all.

01:40:25
<transcript>: Wiest, dude, we.

01:40:25
<transcript>: for the follow

01:40:28
<transcript>: For the follow. I missed that four minutes ago. Sorry about that.

01:40:28
<transcript>: okay

01:40:33
gitpush_gitpaid: its supposedly an important update

01:40:34
<transcript>: Okay, so we got some styling. I'm not going to worry about styling. Ship types. Does it work.

01:40:34
<transcript>: question

01:40:40
<transcript>: Question. Does it work? Bishop? Am I just reviewing the code for like, you want to make sure it looks nice.

01:40:40
<transcript>: like it

01:40:40
bishopdev: yes it does

01:40:41
bishopdev: u can run it

01:40:42
<transcript>: Like it's functional. Everything works.

01:40:46
bishopdev: no, not looks nice

01:40:53
mattmancodes: yeah there's a zero day in Chrome, isn't there?

01:40:53
<transcript>: Yes, it does. You can run it. Okay. Cool. You just want me to review and kind of like give feedback because somebody's going to be looking at this, presumably like an employer or something.

01:40:55
<transcript>: That looks nice.

01:40:58
bishopdev: No, I had the feedback

01:40:58
<transcript>: Yeah, that was bad.

01:40:58
<transcript>: that was a bad way

01:41:03
<transcript>: That was a bad way of putting it not looks nice, just like a normal code review. You have the feedback.

01:41:09
bishopdev: and I'll share the feedback with you after

01:41:09
<transcript>: You have the feedback.

01:41:14
bishopdev: cause I'm so stewing over it

01:41:21
<transcript>: Just want to make sure I do the right thing here. And I'll share the feedback with you after. Oh, okay. So you just want me to read it kind of like get a feel for the code, and then you're going to share something. Okay. Got it. Let me look at your code here. Okay.

01:41:31
<transcript>: I've never seen this. I've used class names a lot.

01:41:31
<transcript>: i just

01:41:38
beganovich76: not exporting fns with `function` keyword, instant "changes required"

01:41:45
<transcript>: I just use tailwind so I'm so lost whenever I see any other styling solution like this bind. I'm so curious what this does shift type carrier about ship got a position number number, board size, width number? Yes. Okay. Interface. Ship.

01:41:45
<transcript>: cool

01:41:51
<transcript>: Cool could maybe do this as an enum sell state miss hit undefined.

01:41:51
<transcript>: interface

01:42:01
<transcript>: Interface game board has cell state okay 2d array of cells wait cell States were miss hit and yeah okay got it ships.

01:42:07
<transcript>: Yes, those is game over boolean. Okay ship types, record ship type and then.

01:42:07
<transcript>: yes

01:42:09
<transcript>: Yes, you're just putting all that.

01:42:09
<transcript>: into

01:42:13
<transcript>: Into did they provide that in a json file or something.

01:42:21
bishopdev: just follow the code :) I did extra

01:42:29
<transcript>: Were you supposed to read the json file in and dynamically handle the ship types no matter what they are or something? I don't know. I just didn't understand if that's what they were supposed to just follow the code. I did extra. Oh, okay. Create empty board board size.

01:42:29
<transcript>: what was board

01:42:30
<transcript>: What was board size.

01:42:30
<transcript>: okay

01:42:34
<transcript>: Okay with a number. Okay, width, height.

01:42:41
<transcript>: So you go and you just go through them all and you push empty array.

01:42:43
<transcript>: And then.

01:42:43
<transcript>: you take

01:42:48
<transcript>: You take the one you just push and push undefined for all of the width.

01:42:48
<transcript>: okay

01:42:49
<transcript>: Okay.

01:42:49
<transcript>: const sh

01:43:02
<transcript>: Const ships place all ships. I guess we'll see that code in a SEC and then cell state is board ships is game of fraud. Okay, get initial random position. I got to watch time here because I got to bring on somebody.

01:43:07
<transcript>: Get initial random position ship size number.

01:43:15
<transcript>: Get initial random position so given a ship size the board size and is horizontal is horizontal.

01:43:20
<transcript>: Oh if the ship is horizontal.

01:43:24
<transcript>: Okay. Max.

01:43:29
<transcript>: So just placing the ship positions makes sense. Okay. I'm going to kind of gloss over.

01:43:34
<transcript>: Get initial random position. Get initial ramp position.

01:43:34
<transcript>: is horizontal

01:43:41
<transcript>: Is horizontal. Okay. So you're randomly doing horizontal or vertical? Yeah. Because you can do the ships either way. Yeah. Got it.

01:43:46
<transcript>: Place all ships. Okay. It's going to go through and do all this. Yes.

01:43:46
<transcript>: expensive

01:43:50
<transcript>: Expensive. It allows us to randomly generate the board ships.

01:43:56
<transcript>: Okay.

01:44:00
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:44:00
<transcript>: is

01:44:04
<transcript>: Is dead ship board cell state.

01:44:15
<transcript>: So if every position is a hit the ship is dead got it game over if every ship is dead love it this is great ship number of hits.

01:44:15
<transcript>: so

01:44:18
<transcript>: So count the number of hits on a given ship.

01:44:21
<transcript>: Okay launch missile.

01:44:21
<transcript>: we're not

01:44:28
<transcript>: We're not going to validate hitters within bounds or that it's not already in hit list. We'll do this in the game interface.

01:44:32
<transcript>: Launch missile okay.

01:44:32
<transcript>: so you

01:44:36
<transcript>: So you say you're launching it at a board. These coordinates. Okay.

01:44:39
<transcript>: If hit ship.

01:44:42
<transcript>: Board sell State equals.

01:44:46
<transcript>: Okay.

01:44:48
<transcript>: Else.

01:44:48
<transcript>: i'm trying

01:44:51
<transcript>: I'm trying to track but I don't know if I tracked this.

01:44:56
<transcript>: So you're just going over all the cell States.

01:45:05
bishopdev: yeah, cause of immutability in react

01:45:07
bishopdev: to track changes

01:45:09
<transcript>: And you're returning them as normal, just like untouches if they're not the one you just dealt with. Otherwise you're returning hit if it hit it. Yeah. Okay.

01:45:09
<transcript>: immutably

01:45:18
<transcript>: Immutably. Okay. Got it. Yeah. So track changes and then this one is miss if it's not a hit. Yeah. Got it. Const is game over, game over.

01:45:23
<transcript>: Okay board size. Get dynamic image URL.

01:45:32
<transcript>: Okay. Our render hits. So this is how you're. Yep. Hit Small. Okay. Got it.

01:45:35
<transcript>: This is how you're rendering it.

01:45:35
<transcript>: board page

01:45:36
<transcript>: Board page.

01:45:41
<transcript>: On sell. Click. You're going to launch missile. Yep, yep, yep. Set board. Got it.

01:45:45
<transcript>: Makes sense, Makes sense? Board status.

01:45:48
<transcript>: Logic types.

01:45:50
<transcript>: Okay.

01:45:50
<transcript>: so

01:45:52
<transcript>: So.

01:45:52
<transcript>: trying to understand

01:45:56
<transcript>: Trying to understand what board status is in the UI.

01:46:02
<transcript>: Aboard status is like the whole actual board. Yeah. Okay. Got it. Okay. I've read. I've read the code.

01:46:05
<transcript>: I feel like I get the gist of it.

01:46:05
<transcript>: i feel like

01:46:10
<transcript>: I feel like I should have enough context to digest the feedback you got? What feedback did you get.

01:46:16
bishopdev: placed all the code in one file which makes it hard to review and understand the logic. Additionally just a nit comment - having variables named with just one character makes it hard to rename them in the future.

01:46:28
<transcript>: I think this looks fine. It looks good. I don't have any negative feelings. What did they say? Were they tilted? Play all the code in one file, which makes it hard to review and understand the logic. Additionally, just a nit comment. Having variables named with just one character makes it hard to rename them in the future.

01:46:32
<transcript>: What variable did you have named with one.

01:46:36
<transcript>: Like in a lambda type function.

01:46:36
<transcript>: where did you

01:46:38
<transcript>: Where did you have one character.

01:46:44
<transcript>: I don't even see any oh, like J and I. Are you kidding me.

01:46:48
<transcript>: All the code in one file makes it way easier to review.

01:46:52
bishopdev: that's it .. that's the feedback for a get in the door interview for a senior fullstack cloud engineer ..

01:46:54
<transcript>: That's annoying Bishop. I'm with you. It's annoying.

01:47:00
ben_winnen: That is wildly bad feedback.

01:47:02
<transcript>: That's the feedback for a get in the door interview for senior full stock cloud engineer. What this is for.

01:47:08
<transcript>: Full stack. That is really bad feedback. Yeah, it really sucks.

01:47:08
<transcript>: like i think

01:47:09
bishopdev: GET IN THE DOOR !!!

01:47:11
<transcript>: Like I think I've seen prime with this take.

01:47:14
beganovich76: what senior fullstack cloud engineer even means

01:47:14
<transcript>: A lot of people are hard on.

01:47:18
<transcript>: If it's an organization that gives.

01:47:22
beganovich76: i've been coding 10+ years and i can't get it

01:47:24
bishopdev: @beganovich76 I do devops + development

01:47:27
<transcript>: Code challenges than just like you don't even want to apply or work there because they're out of touch. But it's not that it's just that people are bad at interviewing.

01:47:28
beganovich76: oh i see

01:47:33
<transcript>: The problem isn't coding challenges or take home stuff. The problem is people just aren't very good at it.

01:47:35
<transcript>: And that's the problem.

01:47:37
rollie042: I thought the same thing about breaking it up by files, for what it's worth

01:47:40
<transcript>: If that's his feedback, I'm sure that's what his code reviews look like as well.

01:47:40
<transcript>: and i

01:47:40
bishopdev: I do fullstack dev + azure/aws etc

01:47:45
rollie042: But I wouldn't nix you for that

01:47:51
<transcript>: And I said his. I don't know. He or she what senior Full stack manager even means I've been coding ten plus years and I can't get it. I do devops plus development. Okay. I got to take quick break.

01:47:51
<transcript>: i'm going to pee and

01:47:54
<transcript>: I'm going to pee and I'll be back with.

01:47:54
<transcript>: a guest

01:47:55
<transcript>: A guest.

01:47:59
<transcript>: Assuming my overlays support it.

01:47:59
<transcript>: hopefully everything

01:48:03
<transcript>: Hopefully everything works cool. Okay. Be right back.

01:48:07
<transcript>: Can't find the button. Where's the button? There it is.

01:48:36
beganovich76: tbh feedback sucks

01:49:00
rollie042: Your logic is very reasonable organized across functions and broken up into small-ish chunks that makes it sufficiently simple to understand

01:49:26
bishopdev: I was so annoyed I wanted to send an 'angry' email

01:50:06
gitpush_gitpaid: who is jason lengstorf

01:50:08
bishopdev: thought it wouldn't be professional  .. I've been in the biz 16 years, feel like I wasted my time doing the take home challenge only for that feedback

01:51:06
mattmancodes: both of the comments would likely be mentioned in a code review though. I don't get the 'harder to rename' one but would generally advise against single letter variable names.

01:51:13
beganovich76: @BishopDev did you proceed or quit

01:51:41
bishopdev: @beganovich76 that was the walk in challenge, we never spoke

01:51:51
beganovich76: fair one

01:51:56
bishopdev: based on that challenge and feedback they said they won't be proceeding

01:51:59
bishopdev: that's what annoys me

01:52:07
jokestera_e: surprised Adam did have the guest fro his podcast

01:52:12
jokestera_e: didn't*

01:52:13
mattmancodes: that's harsh

01:52:30
rollie042: How do we build this?  With just npm i && npm run dev is complains about failing to resolve the scss module

01:52:56
fragaverage: hold up

01:52:58
fragaverage: Jason is on today?

01:52:59
bishopdev: @rollie042 "works on my machine' :D

01:53:18
<transcript>: Hey, can you hear me.

01:53:23
<transcript>: I can I'm just moving stuff around here.

01:53:31
<transcript>: No. Are you getting any on my end? Sometimes I have mine way too hot.

01:53:40
zerkbtw: !setup

01:53:40
fossabot: Check the panels below the twitch video player to view all of Adam's setup including Video, Audio & Furniture!

01:53:43
<transcript>: Let's see we're not going to be using chat so I can hide this stuff.

01:53:45
<transcript>: Okay.

01:53:50
<transcript>: So I'm on a break right now. Oh, I am hearing myself.

01:53:53
<transcript>: No worries.

01:54:02
<transcript>: How about now? Check. One, two. I'm yelling.

01:54:04
<transcript>: I'm good.

01:54:11
<transcript>: So when I have people I've not had a lot of people on my stream.

01:54:11
<transcript>: i've had like

01:54:17
<transcript>: I've had like David piano. David like X state. David came on because I had like a specific problem.

01:54:17
<transcript>: i was working

01:54:18
aj_stuyvenberg: Jason Lengstorf, wow that's a get!

01:54:20
<transcript>: I was working with X state, and I had like an issue.

01:54:20
<transcript>: i've had some

01:54:24
<transcript>: I've had some other people on it's mostly like I just bring people on for me.

01:54:24
<transcript>: which is super

01:54:25
zerkbtw: !mouse

01:54:32
zerkbtw: what mouse is that

01:54:34
<transcript>: Which is super selfish, but it's like I just have things I want to talk about or just hang out with this person. And that's all it is. There's no specific set of questions I have, but.

01:54:34
<transcript>: i

01:54:39
fragaverage: Apple magic trackpad

01:54:42
<transcript>: I said it to my chat before I went to break. You're one of my heroes. I mean, you're one of the people in this space that I've looked up to for so long.

01:54:42
<transcript>: and i just

01:54:47
<transcript>: And I just want to pick your brain. If that's cool, that's really it.

01:54:49
<transcript>: Okay, cool.

01:54:56
<transcript>: I am yet. You're getting the wash out. My Lut's not on this. Yeah.

01:54:56
mattmancodes: still expecting it to be Dax

01:54:59
<transcript>: Oh no.

01:54:59
<transcript>: an ob

01:55:02
<transcript>: An obs just on my camera feed. Yeah.

01:55:05
<transcript>: That is awesome.

01:55:13
<transcript>: Yeah. I thought about starting up the virtual camera so you could get the lut on this preview, but okay.

01:55:17
<transcript>: Not a lot of people even know what log is. That's so awesome.

01:55:21
laytanl_: Gangsigns

01:55:25
<transcript>: Exactly. Yeah.

01:55:26
dmdboi: So good of Adam to share his stream with smaller creators

01:55:31
<transcript>: Love it. Okay. I'm going to go ahead and cut away, and we can just do all this on stream.

01:55:31
<transcript>: let's see

01:55:33
mattmancodes: hahaha

01:55:38
<transcript>: Let's see. Unbreak. I don't know if my overlays are going to work. That's the other thing I haven't had a guest on in a long time. Is it working.

01:55:41
<transcript>: Yes.

01:55:44
<transcript>: I see us both.

01:55:47
mattmancodes: yep

01:55:47
<transcript>: Chat is there which is bad.

01:55:52
mattmancodes: it's working

01:55:53
fragaverage: we see you both

01:55:56
fragaverage: great successs

01:56:01
<transcript>: Yeah, yeah. You see us both? We're both, like, kind of anchored to this side of our.

01:56:01
<transcript>: i

01:56:01
rustyd3v: Hey Adam!

01:56:09
<transcript>: I haven't positioned it very well. Okay, chat. I don't want chat going across jason's face. How do I prevent this? I could just hide the whole thing.

01:56:12
<transcript>: Let's do this.

01:56:15
<transcript>: Oh, yeah? Can you guys hear Jason.

01:56:19
mattmancodes: yep

01:56:19
aj_stuyvenberg: Yup!

01:56:21
<transcript>: How about check this? Yeah, just slide new over.

01:56:22
cosmiclasagna: yessirrrr

01:56:22
rustyd3v: Sure

01:56:23
<transcript>: Okay.

01:56:23
mcnets: Yep

01:56:24
rustyd3v: Yess

01:56:26
laytanl_: Change title maybe?

01:56:26
<transcript>: All right, chat.

01:56:26
<transcript>: so

01:56:26
aj_stuyvenberg: You both sound great.

01:56:29
dmdboi: We could land men on the moon but we can't have collabs work first time on Twitch

01:56:29
<transcript>: So I didn't really tell people.

01:56:29
<transcript>: i didn't tell people

01:56:35
<transcript>: I didn't tell people I was bringing you on. I just kind of like the prime agent. Okay, I got to get rid of chat. This is annoying. It's on your face.

01:56:38
mcnets: Hide the source

01:56:42
<transcript>: Yeah. There you go.

01:56:45
<transcript>: There we go. I did.

01:56:52
dmdboi: He doesn't like us

01:56:54
<transcript>: Love it. Then we'll just get rid of the whole overlay. Don't do anything on my stream because it won't show up people. I'm talking to chat.

01:56:56
<transcript>: Yeah. So I didn't tell anybody.

01:56:56
<transcript>: pri

01:57:03
<transcript>: Prime, I think said once that just have people show up and don't advertise it and just surprise people.

01:57:03
<transcript>: so

01:57:06
<transcript>: So Surprise, jason's. Here.

01:57:11
<transcript>: So I told jayson before we came over.

01:57:11
<transcript>: i have people

01:57:14
<transcript>: I have people on my stream for myself.

01:57:17
<transcript>: I don't necessarily think chat.

01:57:17
<transcript>: is

01:57:25
<transcript>: Is going to have a lot of questions for jayz. I have questions for Jason. So I brought Jason on because I just want to talk with him and why not do it on Twitch.

01:57:25
<transcript>: yeah

01:57:35
<transcript>: Yeah, we don't do this often. So, Jason, I told them before. I told you, I said it. This will be a third time. You're one of my heroes. One of the people that before.

01:57:35
<transcript>: i knew

01:57:39
<transcript>: I knew of anyone doing tech content stuff.

01:57:39
<transcript>: i knew of

01:57:46
<transcript>: I knew of Jason Langstore if you were like the first person Jason AF your whole website, the whole thing learned with Jason.

01:57:46
<transcript>: it was like

01:57:51
<transcript>: It was like you were the celebrity in dev world, and I hadn't seen any of the other people out there. Honestly, I don't know.

01:57:51
<transcript>: it's funny how

01:57:53
<transcript>: It's funny how that works.

01:57:54
ben_winnen: Jason's great! Saw him building "Sandwiches" the other day for a Frontend Masters course.

01:57:58
<transcript>: I have since discovered other content creators in space, but you were the first.

01:58:06
itsmeleague: you were his first Pog

01:58:10
<transcript>: Yeah, exactly.

01:58:18
<transcript>: Am I going to regret this.

01:58:44
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:00:31
<transcript>: It's funny.

02:00:31
<transcript>: i feel like that

02:00:47
<transcript>: I feel like that is the pipeline, though. Developers all kind of like, eventually want to become content creators. Maybe not all of them. But it does seem like there's a lot of us trying to get out of our job and do this thing that doesn't pay well, why do what was your motivation? Like, you started sharing stuff online.

02:00:47
<transcript>: i

02:00:51
<transcript>: I asked because I need to figure this out. I need to figure out why I'm doing what I'm doing.

02:01:25
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:03:17
<transcript>: Work together? Yeah.

02:03:34
gitpush_gitpaid: chat more cooperative? have you tried doing a macbook giveaway?

02:03:45
<transcript>: No, I make sense and I never would have thought like I wanted to perform.

02:03:50
<transcript>: If you had told me before I got on twitch that that was part of my personality.

02:03:50
<transcript>: i just would have

02:04:00
<transcript>: I just would have thought that was the case, but I would say now that I'm on twitch. I think I do, like a little bit of the I don't know. This is like coming up with stuff to make the show better.

02:04:00
<transcript>: and

02:04:07
<transcript>: And just daily kind of coming up with ideas. There's something about it. I never would have thought I was a performer. I'm not a former musician.

02:04:10
<transcript>: My brother is, though.

02:04:25
earholesmcgee: Jason, what is on your shirt? Looks dope

02:04:27
<transcript>: Well, yeah. So I've done really well financially. And I think.

02:04:27
<transcript>: there's a lot of

02:04:32
<transcript>: There's a lot of senior developers share that and kind of like we get paid well to do what we do.

02:04:34
<transcript>: Not have.

02:04:36
<transcript>: Oh, got it.

02:04:41
earholesmcgee: BROOOO

02:04:43
earholesmcgee: HOLY SHIT

02:04:45
mattmancodes: no one wins the macbook though, that's the secret

02:04:46
<transcript>: I got you. Yeah. No, I'm sorry to everybody in chat like I'm normally very connected to every message that comes in, and I'm completely ignoring it because I'm just nerding out talking to Jason right now.

02:04:47
earholesmcgee: Thats next level swag

02:04:49
<transcript>: I will not probably read a single message.

02:04:52
<transcript>: Yeah. I think I've done really well.

02:04:58
<transcript>: I'm giving away my macbooks. Okay.

02:05:07
cosmiclasagna: think we should change the title of the stream right now

02:05:07
<transcript>: This one is a very small chance. It's a .01% chance. So nobody's won it yet. But this has been a couple weeks. Give it time.

02:05:07
<transcript>: yeah

02:05:12
dmdboi: Confirmed dislikes us

02:05:14
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't know. I think I'm at a stage in my career where I feel like things have gone really well.

02:05:14
<transcript>: and i'm

02:05:15
dmdboi: Booo

02:05:18
<transcript>: And I'm dipping my toes in the content stuff that's been fun, but.

02:05:18
<transcript>: the analogy

02:05:25
daglee: Mac give-away? More like a endless pit that eats all my adam bucks!

02:05:26
fragaverage: no one can win, the math is flawed

02:05:28
earholesmcgee: Would trade the mac for a date :D

02:05:38
<transcript>: The analogy I thought of was like, the airline or the airplane. Put your oxygen mask on. I feel like I've got my oxygen mask on. And the only thing I can think at this point in my career that's worth anything that would be fulfilling in any way whatsoever. It's like helping other people put the mask on kind of thing. So the MacBook to me is like if there's people in another country or there's someone somewhere.

02:05:38
<transcript>: the first macbook

02:05:49
<transcript>: The first MacBook I ever gave away was like a person in Italy who really needed it, and it was random choice. So I just, like, kind of like leaving it up to, like, random odds, math, random or whatever.

02:05:50
gitpush_gitpaid: in that analogy its more like adam took dax's oxygen mask

02:05:55
<transcript>: Yeah, that's the whole macbook thing. I think just like trying to find ways to.

02:05:55
<transcript>: somehow

02:05:59
dmdboi: Okay but who has the better beard? Lets vote with our limited adamcoins

02:06:00
anmol99tv: Helooooo Adam

02:06:06
<transcript>: Somehow help people out. And I don't know if I can do that with content. That's a big reason why I had you on Jason was like, I want to figure out my identity. Why am I doing content at all? Do I have good reasons.

02:06:09
<transcript>: You do it full time now, right.

02:06:09
<transcript>: did you leave

02:06:11
<transcript>: Did you leave natalify.

02:06:52
gitpush_gitpaid: whats his twitch handle?

02:06:55
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:07:20
<transcript>: No, I picture it. Yeah.

02:07:24
mcnets: jlengstorf

02:08:08
gitpush_gitpaid: oh snap i follow him

02:08:55
<transcript>: Sure.

02:09:24
<transcript>: Yeah, sounds awful.

02:09:47
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:10:32
earholesmcgee: What was the main reason to sell your agency?

02:11:03
<transcript>: I think.

02:11:03
<transcript>: the whole

02:11:09
<transcript>: The whole content thing just getting into it the last year or so that's the thing I've told myself is.

02:11:09
<transcript>: like ultimately

02:11:17
<transcript>: Like, ultimately, if I can inspire people and I've gotten some messages that make me think, like, I'm going in the right direction, like someone was inspired by something I did.

02:11:17
<transcript>: that feels

02:11:22
<transcript>: That feels really nice, but I don't know if it justifies like if I'm doing enough.

02:11:22
<transcript>: it's like

02:11:34
<transcript>: It's like straddling the line. Where now that you're full time. I've got questions about that for me. It's always going to be this kind of part time thing. I don't think I'm ever going to completely leave my work.

02:11:34
<transcript>: but

02:11:42
<transcript>: But straddling lines is like, Am I really doing enough to justify the time and the effort and the mind share that I put into it.

02:11:42
<transcript>: yeah

02:11:50
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if I'll ever feel like I really know what I'm doing on the content front, if I really know why I'm doing it, even.

02:12:06
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:13:00
<transcript>: Have you felt like now that you're full time.

02:13:00
<transcript>: is there more

02:13:16
<transcript>: Is there more pressure on? I feel like if I were full time doing content stuff, I would feel like the decision making just had so much more pressure. Like I would constantly feel like, I don't know if I'm investing in the right things. Do you feel like that just in terms of platforms, in terms of what content you're doing, where.

02:13:28
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:14:13
<transcript>: It's such a bubble? Yeah.

02:14:31
<transcript>: Sure.

02:14:34
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:16:34
<transcript>: So it's not like it has to be. Yeah, it's not like the people that.

02:16:34
<transcript>: you're helping

02:16:40
<transcript>: You're helping now. Don't have to be the people you're helping in five years, you don't have to maintain this growing audience.

02:16:40
<transcript>: of the same people

02:16:43
<transcript>: Of the same people. That's really good.

02:16:57
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:18:00
<transcript>: It's the whole point. Yeah.

02:18:24
<transcript>: The whole community thing is another angle.

02:18:27
<transcript>: This is another aspect I just try not to even think about.

02:18:39
<transcript>: I see a lot of the tech creators end up with large groups of people that are around them at all times. And you kind of know those people as being, oh, that's a member of ex's community.

02:18:39
<transcript>: like they have

02:18:42
<transcript>: Like they have like sort of disciples and.

02:18:58
<transcript>: It's like those are the kinds of things that I just don't know what to do with in my brain. And it's like I I feel like that's not for me. I'm not going to go that far down this path. But I keep like, I don't know. I keep doing the streaming thing, and I keep kind of being drawn to contenty stuff and.

02:18:58
<transcript>: i don

02:19:02
<transcript>: I don't know what to do with it. I did start a discord server.

02:19:07
bishopdev: I can be your disciple Adam, point me in the wrong direction

02:19:10
<transcript>: I didn't want it to be about me. And it's exactly what you said. It felt weird to have adam's discord server.

02:19:10
<transcript>: so

02:19:11
<transcript>: So.

02:19:11
<transcript>: now like it's just

02:19:15
<transcript>: Now like it's just watch dev. It's like about watching developers stream.

02:19:26
<transcript>: I don't know if that'll work out, if it's even serving a purpose to me. It was like I want to have a place to hang out with twitch when I'm not streaming. I'm not streaming all the time. I don't know.

02:19:36
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:20:03
<transcript>: Well, I feel like it's such a brand at this point.

02:20:16
<transcript>: You have all the guests on. I feel like the show is so much you make it so much about the guests, like they're teaching you on the show. So I do feel like it's different than just like having jason's discord.

02:20:23
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:20:30
<transcript>: Sure.

02:20:37
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:21:07
gitpush_gitpaid: i cant be a disciple... im more of a cain

02:21:14
mehjes: head: up and down

02:21:16
<transcript>: And that already exists. Like in our community. I mean, there are already. Is that no same. Yeah. But it's there. And I do want to avoid it.

02:21:17
dmdboi: We're not a cult

02:21:23
<transcript>: And maybe it just takes certain personalities. Maybe I don't have to worry about it because maybe people wouldn't follow me. I don't have a lot of takes. I don't.

02:21:23
<transcript>: have a lot of

02:21:28
<transcript>: Have a lot of big, strong opinions about things. So I think.

02:21:28
<transcript>: i can maybe

02:21:31
<transcript>: I can maybe walk that tie rope and avoid it.

02:21:33
<transcript>: I don't know.

02:21:50
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:22:07
mattmancodes: that's Adam with larabars

02:23:05
<transcript>: There's just a lot of influence that comes with it. There is like a draw to it. It's kind of power or something.

02:23:16
aj_stuyvenberg: every day for Dax and Adam: "You know what, today is the day" <record new episode of tomorrow.fm>

02:23:35
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:23:48
<transcript>: Sure.

02:24:00
aj_stuyvenberg: Corey Quinn is a good example I think. I'm sure he'd like to punch me but he truly doesn't punch down.

02:24:01
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:24:08
mattmancodes: excellent point

02:24:58
<transcript>: Oh, I bet Yeah.

02:25:00
gitpush_gitpaid: adam isnt real. no way is someone that calm and collected

02:25:02
<transcript>: The internet's a mean place. It really is.

02:25:02
<transcript>: tech and

02:25:06
<transcript>: Tech, and it's not escaped our community. I mean, I think.

02:25:10
<transcript>: Part of it is like I'm on Twitter and I enjoy the drama.

02:25:10
<transcript>: i feel like

02:25:21
<transcript>: I feel like it's just fun to me not to be hateful, but it's fun just seeing like if there's nothing going on on Twitter, I feel like my life is lacking a little something.

02:25:31
<transcript>: But I feel like a lot of it is teasing each other and it feels like in good nature. But the replies can get out of hand or they can get way more hateful.

02:25:37
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:25:40
<transcript>: Sure.

02:25:49
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:26:15
aj_stuyvenberg: he's like this IRL, I swear.

02:26:17
gitpush_gitpaid: i would absolutely dunk on a friend in public.

02:26:22
<transcript>: No, I've done it. I know I've done it. I know I've said things on Twitter with tone that I shouldn't have. I've attacked. I mean, I never, like you said, wouldn't punch down.

02:26:22
<transcript>: i do

02:26:25
<transcript>: I do get into the satire thing I think you're describing.

02:26:25
<transcript>: a lot of my toxic

02:26:27
<transcript>: A lot of my toxic behaviors.

02:26:30
gitpush_gitpaid: @aj_stuyvenberg na we need coffeytime to verify.

02:26:30
<transcript>: But it's good, it's good to hear it.

02:26:32
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:26:52
<transcript>: Sure.

02:27:03
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:27:33
<transcript>: I bet.

02:27:49
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:27:57
gitpush_gitpaid: whos ryan florence

02:27:58
<transcript>: You're stuck with it.

02:28:06
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:28:10
<transcript>: I don't think they got away from it. Yeah.

02:28:21
<transcript>: And your entire physical appearance. Be tough.

02:28:21
<transcript>: so

02:28:23
<transcript>: So you do it full time now.

02:28:26
earholesmcgee: Fuck Lambda. Shit sucked.

02:28:26
<transcript>: What is it like having.

02:28:29
<transcript>: Income pressure.

02:28:31
<transcript>: Does the content stuff.

02:28:31
<transcript>: and

02:28:40
<transcript>: And you cannot answer this or you cannot get into detail if you don't want to. But just like I feel like I'd be so stressed if it were my job. It's kind of fun to play with. But.

02:28:40
<transcript>: does

02:28:42
<transcript>: Does it add stress.

02:28:49
jokestera_e: Does he have a birds aren't real coffee mug? If so thats dope

02:29:11
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:30:16
<transcript>: Oh, nice.

02:30:20
<transcript>: Sure, Yeah.

02:30:59
ryankhawkins: @gitpush_gitpaid Someone with a great first name.

02:31:04
<transcript>: Sure.

02:31:13
<transcript>: Yeah, go for it.

02:31:19
<transcript>: Nice.

02:31:22
<transcript>: Wow.

02:31:24
<transcript>: That is amazing.

02:31:27
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:31:38
gitpush_gitpaid: @gitpush_gitpaid MaxLOL

02:31:40
<transcript>: Oh no.

02:31:42
mattmancodes: @gitpush_gitpaid one of the Remix creators

02:31:43
<transcript>: You made that.

02:31:48
<transcript>: I thought I got such a random thing to find on a mug, but you made it. That is hilarious.

02:31:53
earholesmcgee: That might be the most Jason thing ever

02:31:54
natenorberg: can confirm. i've seen birds and they're jerks

02:32:03
<transcript>: Okay. So it's gotten way better than I would have imagined. Like, if I imagine going off, I don't make money from content. So the idea of starting into content. You're already making money.

02:32:12
<transcript>: Wow, Yeah.

02:32:38
earholesmcgee: Just quit my job.

02:33:09
<transcript>: Sure.

02:33:19
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:33:40
<transcript>: Wow, Yeah.

02:33:45
<transcript>: Everybody knows.

02:33:49
<transcript>: I'm gonna be a content creator.

02:33:49
<transcript>: yeah

02:33:50
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:34:24
<transcript>: Well, Unfortunately, Jason, you are. You're too inspiring. And ear Holes has already quit his job. So how do you see that in Chat? But we've got people quitting their jobs. They're becoming content creators.

02:34:26
<transcript>: I think I just.

02:34:26
<transcript>: yeah

02:34:28
<transcript>: Yeah, exactly.

02:34:38
<transcript>: Yeah, for real. I mean in consulting. I can say that's true. I've never done it on the content side.

02:34:38
<transcript>: but

02:34:43
<transcript>: But there's a lot of money to be made just based on being able to talk to people.

02:34:45
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:34:52
earholesmcgee: After five years are you still as inspired with the show?

02:34:57
thdxr: oh the surprise guest is jason

02:35:01
<transcript>: I don't know. I really want to talk to you, Jason, because I'm at this kind of like this early stage of dabbling in the Creator stuff. And I think one of the questions I think I've even asked you this before and I can't remember your answer. So I'm going to make you say it again. Or maybe you have different insights now.

02:35:03
thdxr: surprised he’s associating with this scammer

02:35:04
<transcript>: Just like figuring out.

02:35:04
<transcript>: your identity

02:35:14
mattmancodes: LUL

02:35:15
<transcript>: Your identity. I think I just struggle a lot with like I said, I don't have takes. I don't really have strong opinions on technology. I've been doing this for a long time, so I've been like, a software engineer for 15 years.

02:35:15
<transcript>: i've done

02:35:28
<transcript>: I've done the startup thing. I've had a very weird career, so I feel like career advice is just hard for me to give because I've never had a resume. I've never applied for a job. I've never done a leap code interview. I wouldn't be able to pass one if I tried.

02:35:31
gabrielbrisson: LUL

02:35:32
<transcript>: Just very atypical career a lot of fortunate like breaks things like that.

02:35:42
<transcript>: And then in terms of my technical stuff, I just don't feel like there's anything. Tutorials have never felt like a path I want to go down. I don't feel like.

02:35:42
<transcript>: it just

02:35:51
<transcript>: It just doesn't seem like evergreen enough or something. I don't know. I'd feel like if I made a tutorial, I'd feel like it was out of date immediately. But then it's like, what's left? I don't know.

02:35:53
thdxr: read the chat adam

02:35:57
thdxr: read it and be embarrassed

02:36:30
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:37:04
gitpush_gitpaid: instructions unclear. watched old spice commercial and wanna be that guy

02:38:04
<transcript>: That sometimes works. People.

02:38:04
<transcript>: seem to

02:38:05
<transcript>: Seem to.

02:38:10
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:38:31
thdxr: adam needed to hear this

02:38:35
bishopdev: YES !! so much yes, think that's what contributes a lot to adam's stream

02:38:46
mehulsharmamat: can chat fill me in just came

02:38:54
bishopdev: @thdxr he's selling himself short, he's had a lot of experiences not many devs had

02:39:02
bishopdev: it's not better or worse, just different and it's a learning point

02:39:23
<transcript>: I was just going to say I just talked to another tech youtuber, who said similar things. Just the storytelling. I think I wanted to get into YouTube.

02:39:29
<transcript>: And felt like that's. Just like what I should be doing. Twitch feels so like here and gone.

02:39:43
<transcript>: And they kind of said that they said, just tell stories. Stop trying to come up with catchy. This will be a big one. But just like, share stories from things I've gone through in my career.

02:39:55
bishopdev: @thdxr also .. if this fails there's always only fans

02:40:16
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:40:21
<transcript>: No right.

02:40:53
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:41:19
<transcript>: Interesting.

02:41:29
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:42:19
dmdboi: LUL

02:43:08
<transcript>: Sure.

02:43:29
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:43:32
<transcript>: Okay, so challenge.

02:43:32
<transcript>: so this

02:43:37
<transcript>: So this is getting a little too like I feel like this is all too above board. And I have to ask you.

02:43:37
<transcript>: you can just

02:43:43
<transcript>: You can just ignore me. You can just not answer this question. But I feel like you are like the person in our circles.

02:43:43
<transcript>: in the tech

02:43:46
<transcript>: In the tech influencer whatever circle.

02:43:53
<transcript>: It's like very clearly. You have good intentions. You've got to have one bad intention. Do you have.

02:43:53
<transcript>: any bad

02:44:00
<transcript>: Any bad intentions in terms of your content creation, like any goals that are just like evil. I don't know, not evil. You know what I mean.

02:44:00
<transcript>: it's everything you

02:44:05
mattmancodes: hahaha

02:44:06
<transcript>: It's everything you do, just altruistic. Or is there anything where it's like, no, I want to be famous. I don't know. Something like that.

02:44:15
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:44:25
thdxr: unflattering

02:44:42
<transcript>: Not evil. That was.

02:44:42
<transcript>: wrong

02:44:43
bishopdev: you all laugh but I think he'd make a killing on OF with his baby face

02:44:43
<transcript>: Wrong.

02:44:48
<transcript>: Now we're talking.

02:45:04
fideloper: Who's this?

02:45:08
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:45:14
thdxr: name then

02:45:16
thdxr: them

02:45:19
earholesmcgee: !evil

02:45:25
<transcript>: So I think I get really negative sometimes. And I think that's it it's a sense of injustice. If I feel like.

02:45:25
<transcript>: somebody's in

02:45:33
<transcript>: Somebody's in a position or somebody is doing things and abusing a power or abusing their stance in the community. It really bothers me.

02:45:39
<transcript>: I can't not publicly say things, and I think all of the negativity I've ever spewed on the internet.

02:45:39
<transcript>: which

02:45:42
<transcript>: Which I don't know it's more than I'd like it to be.

02:45:54
<transcript>: It's in that vein, it's in that like just I feel like people are being misled or people are going down a path that I wish they wouldn't go down. And I just have to poke at that thing.

02:45:59
<transcript>: It feels bad. It always feels bad to go back and read it. But I think that's what it comes out of.

02:46:30
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:46:33
<transcript>: Sure.

02:46:40
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:47:18
thdxr: yesss agree gotta ignore

02:47:21
thdxr: ignore ignore ignore

02:47:21
<transcript>: It's the dhh marketing. That's why I should never respond to dhh Tweets. But I always do not that anyone cares.

02:47:23
thdxr: starve them

02:47:27
vardahoth: those type of people are frauds

02:47:41
<transcript>: Yes.

02:48:01
<transcript>: I know.

02:48:07
<transcript>: Yeah, I hate that. That works.

02:48:14
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:48:21
<transcript>: However.

02:48:28
<transcript>: Like just dms and stuff. You mean.

02:48:29
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:49:20
thdxr: sounds like an abuse of power

02:49:26
rollie042: ^

02:49:27
<transcript>: I've not done it the right way.

02:49:30
<transcript>: But that's okay. I can learn.

02:49:30
<transcript>: i can learn

02:49:43
<transcript>: I can learn and I think you said something earlier. Just. I asked you if you had any selfish or just like non altruistic intentions. You said this attention thing. I've definitely been told by an old friend that.

02:49:43
<transcript>: i have

02:49:54
<transcript>: I have a desire for attention. And I thought that was so negative. And I felt like I don't want that to be part of my personality. But maybe it's okay. Maybe it's okay if we just, like, the showmanship.

02:49:54
<transcript>: this

02:49:57
<transcript>: This is an okay thing to want.

02:50:08
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:50:33
lilfreezi: are u telling me that i DIDNT win

02:50:36
<transcript>: Man, I've seen some stuff lately in terms of just like.

02:50:36
<transcript>: women program

02:50:42
mattmancodes: no one wins

02:50:43
<transcript>: Women programmers some things that they have to deal with with dms on Twitter, with twitch chat. I mean, it's obnoxious. It's insane.

02:50:53
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:51:09
vardahoth: I pretty much ignore if it's white or not or whatever race.

02:51:13
aint313: someone tell him to disable the notifications pls

02:51:25
vardahoth: not color blind, just doesn't mean as much to me as it does to people who talk about it.

02:51:37
<transcript>: You can use it for good too. Yeah.

02:52:12
thdxr: the level of confidence in knowing who’s good and bad can only come from a white person

02:52:40
<transcript>: That's good.

02:52:40
<transcript>: yeah

02:52:42
<transcript>: Yeah, I got to digest all this.

02:52:47
<transcript>: It's recorded. I'll have the recording. I can just go back and watch this and relearn all this.

02:53:01
<transcript>: Wait, I got to read that. Because.

02:53:01
<transcript>: could you make it

02:53:06
bishopdev: @thdxr also, for more context, a white person IN AMERICA !

02:53:07
amanharwara: will this be uploaded to youtube?

02:53:09
<transcript>: Could you make it make sense to me? The level of confidence and knowing who's good and bad can only come from white person. I'm trying to understand what you mean. Dex.

02:53:13
bishopdev: :D

02:53:47
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:54:36
<transcript>: Sure.

02:54:38
thdxr: not saying you do this but there’s as much problem from people claiming to do good but are the same set of people who have always had the power abusing it

02:54:41
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:54:56
<transcript>: I got to think about this. I got to do more.

02:54:58
<transcript>: Less.

02:54:58
<transcript>: getting

02:54:59
<transcript>: Getting.

02:54:59
<transcript>: just

02:55:07
<transcript>: Just like annoyed with not even bad actors. Just people that. I don't know. I don't prefer their style.

02:55:07
<transcript>: on the internet

02:55:16
<transcript>: On the Internet. I just let too many things annoy me. I needed to spend less energy on that. More energy on figuring out how to help other people get their shot. Like you said.

02:55:32
<transcript>: Yeah. No, yeah. I should let you go. Oh, wow, yeah. It's been an hour. Jeez. Wow. That happened fast. So what happens when you're having fun? Yeah.

02:55:32
<transcript>: time so

02:55:34
<transcript>: Time so sorry.

02:55:34
<transcript>: yeah

02:55:37
lilfreezi: i am here to help you build a tolerance to idiots (me)

02:55:46
<transcript>: Yeah, almost spicy. We're going to cut it off now before to access any more questions. I still don't even understand what das asked, and I'm going to have to read it again three times. But that's okay, Jason. Thank you so much. I really do appreciate it.

02:55:49
thdxr: nooo

02:55:52
<transcript>: You came on the call immediately. And you asked me if I was using a lut or you asked me if I was shooting in log and I was like this guy.

02:55:52
<transcript>: this guy

02:55:52
thdxr: hahah

02:55:54
<transcript>: This guy gets me.

02:55:56
<transcript>: I care about these things.

02:55:56
<transcript>: man

02:56:07
<transcript>: Man, this has been so helpful. I've got a lot to digest, but I'm just kind of at that stage where I really needed to talk to somebody like you who's done this stuff for a long time, so I really do appreciate it.

02:56:10
codeeric: really interesting conversation, fellas!

02:56:11
mattmancodes: that was great

02:56:18
amanharwara: yeah great convo

02:56:18
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:56:40
mehulsharmamat: super sorry but I came in late -- who is the guest today?

02:56:40
fideloper: wait, who's Jason and where do we find him on the internets?

02:56:42
<transcript>: Love it. Thank you so much. Jason. Take care.

02:56:49
amanharwara: @mehulsharmamat Jason Lengstorf

02:56:49
untitledgooseberry: Only tuned for the last mins but was captivated - great convo

02:56:52
<transcript>: Okay. Let's see if I know how to do this. Did it work? Did I kick him off? We're good. And I need to hit another button. Hang on. I got to hit one more button.

02:56:52
<transcript>: where

02:56:56
mcnets: SeemsGood

02:57:02
<transcript>: Where is it? Oh, no, I don't. That was on the other one. Man, I hate not reading chat. I hate it so much. But I also can't my brain. I can't focus on two things at once.

02:57:07
<transcript>: I can't interact with somebody and look at chat and interact with chat.

02:57:12
<transcript>: I guess when dax comes on, we can just kind of hang out, and then it's a little easier.

02:57:16
<transcript>: It's not the same though when I'm just trying to actually talk to somebody.

02:57:16
<transcript>: do i even read

02:57:22
<transcript>: Do I even read any of this? Do I read all the chat? What do I just different learning for it. I'm just kind of scrolling.

02:57:25
<transcript>: Unflattering. What was unflattering. Also.

02:57:25
<transcript>: if this fails

02:57:28
<transcript>: If this fails, what.

02:57:32
<transcript>: No laugh. Things make killing on only fans what are you guys talking about.

02:57:34
mcnets: It has been perfect

02:57:35
<transcript>: Chris is here.

02:57:35
<transcript>: name

<transcript>: let's face

02:57:39
<transcript>: Let's face.

02:57:39
<transcript>: welcome

02:57:42
thdxr: you were looking for the word unflattering

02:57:44
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat varda. Sounds like an abuse of power.

02:57:45
thdxr: is what i meant

02:57:48
<transcript>: Oh man, I can't read stuff this old because I don't even know what you guys were referring to.

02:57:53
fideloper: found @jlengstorf on the twitters

02:57:59
mehulsharmamat: what was the chat about -- being cool on the internets?

02:58:07
<transcript>: Nobody won the macbook. That's good. Ain't three. One, three. Welcome to Chat. Someone tell him to disable the notifications, please. Oh, so sorry. I'm so sorry. I just now saw that too late. I want to thank all the people that followed me during all that. Amanda martin's, dev, delfos, Achilles.

02:58:07

<transcript>: Setilum.

02:58:09

02:58:17

<transcript>: Your sucksel. Oh, my fiora. Okay. There's a lot of them.

02:58:24
<transcript>: wiest dude

02:58:37
rollie042: The joy of hurting people you don't like

02:58:39
samhuckaby: We need a stream where you just read Twitch usernames for an hour

02:58:44
<transcript>: Wiest dude, I think I saw that one. Okay, not Cofine just doesn't mean wait, what did I miss here? Varda varda hoss. I pretty much ignore if it's white or not. A whatever race. Not for whatever race someone to okay, not colorblind. Just doesn't mean as much to me as it does to people who talk about it.

02:58:52
<transcript>: I'm not following the level of confidence in knowing. Oh, I read this whose good and bad can only come from a white person.

02:58:52
<transcript>: dax could you explain

02:59:04
mattmancodes: we need another geography stream

02:59:12
<transcript>: Dax, could you explain that to me? Oh, you did. Here we go. For more context, a white person in America, Bishop, says, Will this be up to his YouTube? No, I don't really put stuff on YouTube anymore. Not my stream vods. Anyway, I'm not saying you do this, but there's as much problem from people claiming to do good. But of the same set of people who have always had the power of using it.

02:59:17
<transcript>: Interesting. I'm here to help you build a tolerance to idiots.

02:59:19
<transcript>: No ha what.

02:59:19
<transcript>: code

02:59:26
<transcript>: Code. Eric. Welcome to Chat. What do you say? No. About dax? I'm trying to catch up here. I'm almost there.

02:59:38
<transcript>: Great comic super. Sorry, but I came in late. Who is the guest today? Mayhew, it was learned with Jason. Jason Langsorf. Who's? Jason? Where do we find him? On the Internet? Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't do anything.

02:59:38
<transcript>: like

02:59:40
<transcript>: Like that. I'm awful.

02:59:40
<transcript>: i should not

02:59:47
bishopdev: yes, sorry but most of the content creators are from the states, and the discussion around minorities and stuff is SO much different in other countries

02:59:50
<transcript>: I should not have guessed. I don't really know how to do the guest thing. You're supposed to ask him. Like, Where do we find you on the Internet? It just to me. It's like it's Jason. You guys don't know who Jason is.

02:59:50
<transcript>: he

02:59:52
<transcript>: He serious.

02:59:52

02:59:57
<transcript>: great cover oh

03:00:05
<transcript>: Great cover. Oh, great. I'm so glad I said at the beginning I have guests on for my selfish reasons of I want to talk to them.

03:00:05
<transcript>: the fact that we're

03:00:08
mehulsharmamat: @BishopDev interesting..

03:00:08
vardahoth: I don't know who he is.

03:00:16
<transcript>: The fact that we're doing it on twitch is incidental, and I'm sorry. I realize that makes me a jerk. Just ignore you all the whole time, but I just wanted to talk to Jason, and I figure.

03:00:16
<transcript>: like sometimes

03:00:33
<transcript>: Like, sometimes I just get on calls with people and they agree to just get on a phone call and we just talk. But I thought this one could be good to do on Twitch. I don't know. He's a twitch guy. I'm a twitch guy. I did it on Twitch. What was the chat about being cool on the Internet? No, it was about. I just had a lot of questions for Jason.

03:00:33
<transcript>: i'm like

03:00:41
vardahoth: but I'm also fairly new to hopping between programming channels

03:00:51
<transcript>: I'm like early in the content stuff, trying to decide if I even want to do it. If I care at all about doing content. I have a really great job. I love my great job. Do I want to do this stuff? I think I do. I enjoy streaming it's. Fun is fun enough reason. That was kind of why I had them on. I just wanted to have all those conversations.

03:00:56
<transcript>: The joy of hurting people you don't like? Yeah.

03:00:57
mehulsharmamat: you should! yours is a different take and thats imp

03:01:00
gsvolt: https://www.jason.af/ <-- Today's guest

03:01:02
maleero: Maybe just do /shoutout username? I think I follow him on Twitter but not Twitch

03:01:03
<transcript>: Sam, how come I? We need a stream where you just read twitch usernames for an hour. Oh, boy.

03:01:08
<transcript>: Need another geography stream. Okay, guys, we get it. I'm bad at stuff. We get it.

03:01:08

<transcript>: sorry but

03:01:16
amanharwara: Jason's channel is amazing

03:01:16
<transcript>: Sorry but most of the content creators are from the States in the discussion are minorities and stuff is so much different in other countries.

03:01:21
<transcript>: I don't know who he is, but I'm also fairly new to hopping between program channels.

03:01:22
amanharwara: His blog is very good as wel

03:01:26
<transcript>: You should.

03:01:29
<transcript>: Yours is a different take and that's important.

03:01:30
mattmancodes: Uruguay

03:01:42
mcnets: Did you see the session with Jason and FiniteSingularity?

03:01:44
<transcript>: There it is. Jason af. Thank you for that gs vault. Also, welcome to Chat. Maybe do just do shout out username. I can't believe I didn't shout him out. I literally had him on the stream and I didn't do shout out J.

03:01:48
<transcript>: Ling Storef let's see if I get it right.

03:01:48
<transcript>: can't believe

03:01:49
<transcript>: Can't believe.

03:01:49
<transcript>: i didn't even

03:01:50
<transcript>: I didn't even.

03:01:50
<transcript>: i'm

03:01:54
<transcript>: I'm so bad at this. People. I'm so bad.

03:01:59

mattmancodes: hahaha

03:02:07
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah. Jason's the best. Yeah. He's great. His his blog. His Learn with Jason stuff. It's all good. It's all good stuff.

03:02:07
<transcript>: daxy

03:02:08
mattmancodes: clearly not

03:02:11
<transcript>: Daxy is still here. I feel like I had so many questions for you. Dax.

03:02:18
<transcript>: I don't know. What were you saying? Did we say something dumb? Did I say something dumb.

03:02:26
<transcript>: I did feel like Jason at the end was feeling a little like challenge, and I didn't even know what was challenging.

03:02:26
<transcript>: i'm not smart

03:02:35
<transcript>: I'm not smart enough to follow the conversation like somebody said something. Maybe what dax said felt challenging to him, and I didn't even get it.

03:02:39
<transcript>: I would love to get it.

03:02:42
<transcript>: I.

03:02:42
<transcript>: did you see the session

03:02:45
<transcript>: Did you see the session with Jason and finite singularity no.

03:02:45
<transcript>: financing

03:02:47
<transcript>: Financingularity in Jason.

03:02:50
<transcript>: Two people I like.

03:02:52
<transcript>: Okay.

03:02:52
<transcript>: i got to get

03:03:00
<transcript>: I got to get back to work. I don't even know how long have I been streaming? Should I just end the stream now? It's in 3 hours. 3 hours is a good round number. Maybe we just end it.

03:03:03
<transcript>: Give me time to process.

03:03:03
<transcript>: because

03:03:06
<transcript>: Because someone just tell me what was challenging.

03:03:07
mehulsharmamat: adam is the statmuse story out? like how you made the startup since i found out that you did that very late. do you feel like telling your story?

03:03:08
<transcript>: I feel like I should know.

03:03:08
<transcript>: what was

03:03:10
<transcript>: What was challenging.

03:03:13
<transcript>: About something someone said.

03:03:27
<transcript>: Adam is a stamp your story out. Like how you made the startup since I found out that you did that very late. Do you feel like telling your story? Hey, Mayhew I do feel like telling my story. I'm going to be doing some stuff, okay? I'm not even going to do any more work. Forget it. I'm going to be doing some stuff on YouTube.

03:03:27
<transcript>: after

03:03:31
<transcript>: After talking, I talked with Kevin noton, Jr. He's a YouTuber.

03:03:39
<transcript>: Talked with him. Just kind of like, hey, what's YouTube like? And he was like, hey, what's streaming? Like.

03:03:42
<transcript>: Just kind of like sharing stories and.

03:03:42
<transcript>: he's convinced

03:03:59
mattmancodes: it's probably best for you to talk to dax, it'll lose it's meaning in twitch chat - re the challenging topic

03:04:01
dmmulroy: I think Dax's comment about a white guy (e.g. Jason) being the one who's deciding who's good/bad and sharing that in his network could be problematic - though I could also be wrong

03:04:02
<transcript>: He's convinced me I need to spend some time on YouTube. I think I'm just going to be telling stories. I think I'm going to just find ways to take stuff that's happened in my career. A lot of it being statute stuff and share that stuff in a storytelling way that hopefully helps some people. I think I could get excited about that most every other tech content I can't get excited about. I'm not going to make tutorials at this stage of my career. Do you guys.

03:04:02
<transcript>: want to learn

03:04:08
<transcript>: Want to learn anything technical for me? Just like, come to my stream. You might learn something maybe. Or you might teach me something.

03:04:08
<transcript>: yeah

03:04:13
<transcript>: Yeah. I'm going to be telling some stories about that means how we started it.

03:04:13
<transcript>: et cetera

03:04:15
<transcript>: Et cetera et cetera.

03:04:18
<transcript>: It's probably best for you to talk to DAX.

03:04:32
<transcript>: It's meaning in Twist chat, read the challenging topic. Okay, so it was daxis comment about a white guy being the one who's deciding who's good, bad, and sharing that and his network would be problematic. Oh, I see. I got you. I understand dax's comment. Now.

03:04:32
<transcript>: okay

03:04:42
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah. No, I see. Okay. That's why he said Chat challenging. Yeah, I got it all. I love how I was here for that whole thing. And I didn't understand any of it.

03:04:43
mehulsharmamat: yep! your story is the only story for you, it might be boring and overknown for YOU but I feel like it could be so helpful for people that you dont even know exist

03:04:47
<transcript>: I'm really bad at this stuff. I'm going to call it for today.

03:05:00
<transcript>: Yes. Your story is the only story for you might be boring and overknown to you, but I feel like it could be so helpful for people that don't know you exist or you don't even know exist. Yeah. Mayhew we've got a lot of stories from.

03:05:00
<transcript>: the stat

03:05:02
<transcript>: The stat muse origins.

03:05:02
<transcript>: just how

03:05:06
<transcript>: Just how we got into it, why we decided to do it. All that stuff.

03:05:13
<transcript>: Yeah, I think I've got stuff to share. I'm more convinced than ever that I've actually got a reason to make YouTube videos, so I'm going to do it.

03:05:13
<transcript>: okay

03:05:16
<transcript>: Okay. It's been fun as always.

03:05:16
<transcript>: it's always

03:05:18
mehulsharmamat: yay!! :D

03:05:20
mattmancodes: cheers adam, that was a good surprise guest.

03:05:21
<transcript>: It's always fun and maybe we could do it again sometime.

03:05:25
heyglassy: <3

03:05:27
dmmulroy: Great stream

<transcript>: Okay.

18:39:49
<transcript>: i apologize

18:39:51
<transcript>: I apologize.

18:39:53
<transcript>: It's my overhead mic.

18:39:53
<transcript>: and a meeting

18:39:59
<transcript>: And a meeting. Yeah. No, I'm eating. So I'm sorry. I guess I won't be eating while we're talking.

18:40:04
<transcript>: I think I just wanted to debrief after that. I just did that thing with Jason.

18:40:06
<transcript>: And.

18:40:06
<transcript>: is that

18:40:08
<transcript>: Is that why guilt? Is that what it is.

18:40:17
<transcript>: Was Jason. Was Jason behaving in such a way as to have white guilt.

18:40:22
<transcript>: Help me unpack it.

18:40:35
<transcript>: Oh.

18:40:43
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:40:51
<transcript>: Set off some alarms. Yeah.

18:40:55
<transcript>: I wish I would have.

18:40:55
<transcript>: understood

18:40:59
<transcript>: Understood what you meant in the moment.

18:40:59
<transcript>: because

18:41:03
<transcript>: Because I could have maybe been part of the conversation. But.

18:41:03
<transcript>: i tried to

18:41:06
<transcript>: I tried to read it twice, and I still didn't understand.

18:41:06
<transcript>: and then

18:41:07
<transcript>: And then toward the end.

18:41:07
<transcript>: he was like

18:41:18
<transcript>: He was like, I'm glad. I don't know if you were there at the end. He's like, I'm glad. What's that? Okay. Yeah. Like, challenged. And I'm like, oh, he was challenged. What was he challenged by.

18:41:21
<transcript>: I'm so clueless.

18:41:33
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:42:54
<transcript>: No, I get you.

18:43:22
<transcript>: Yeah, I see it.

18:44:15
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:44:21
<transcript>: This is all very helpful.

18:44:58
<transcript>: Yeah. No. I really appreciate you helping me, like, navigate all this and understand it because I just have no outside perspective.

18:45:01
<transcript>: I realize how little I've experienced of the world.

18:45:08
<transcript>: And just like how little I've thought about some of these things that I should think about more.

18:45:31
<transcript>: Gotcha.

18:45:41
<transcript>: Yep.

18:46:01
<transcript>: I'm just a founder.

18:46:17
<transcript>: No.

18:46:22
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. Jordan peele. Yeah. Funny Guy. Right.

18:46:41
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:46:58
<transcript>: Okay.

18:47:22
<transcript>: Yeah, I think they're wrong the educated world's wrong.

18:47:22
<transcript>: generally

18:47:25
<transcript>: Generally about everything.

18:47:25
<transcript>: well i don't feel

18:47:31
<transcript>: Well, I don't feel guilty for being white, so I feel like I'm not doing white guilt things if I don't actually feel guilty, right.

18:47:38
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:47:43
<transcript>: Got it. Okay. This is all very helpful for me.

18:47:50
<transcript>: Next question equally as important is can you not lock into Blue Sky on Web? You have to do it on the mobile app.

18:48:05
<transcript>: Because.

18:48:05
<transcript>: i don't

18:48:07
<transcript>: I don't.

18:48:14
<transcript>: It worked. Oh, really? You got an iphone for this.

18:48:24
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. I figured it out. I've got it open on the Web. Now I got to figure out what my password is.

18:48:24
<transcript>: kinsey

18:48:26
<transcript>: Kinsey, Dodds.

18:48:31
<transcript>: Which I barely know, but he recently followed me.

18:48:31
<transcript>: and he saw

18:48:34
<transcript>: And he saw my video this morning and sent me an invite.

18:48:42
<transcript>: Your message didn't get far enough out there. Dax. You didn't infiltrate the whole world.

18:48:48
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:48:50
<transcript>: You didn't spoil his brand.

18:48:58
<transcript>: By the way, did you just unfollow me on twitch because I had a very round number of followers and I just noticed I'm one down.

18:49:03
<transcript>: Somebody did not like the Jason Stream. I said something dumb.

18:49:03
<transcript>: okay

18:49:07
<transcript>: Okay. Cool. I don't want to keep more of your time.

18:49:07
<transcript>: sometime

18:49:10
<transcript>: Sometime. I want to talk. Like just all the things.

18:49:10
<transcript>: we got to record

18:49:15
<transcript>: We got to record a podcast at some point, or do we that's what we need to talk about. It's like do we.

18:49:19
<transcript>: Want to do a different thing, like a different format.

18:50:04
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:50:16
<transcript>: Okay.

18:50:18
<transcript>: Cool.

18:50:20
<transcript>: And when I said everything.

18:50:20
<transcript>: is like just

<transcript>: Is like just all the things we're doing, just level setting at some point.

18:50:24
<transcript>: on

18:50:36
<transcript>: On priorities of them. We've both been super busy, and I'm going to get done and out of this stapmies hole, and I'm going to be trying to figure out what I should focus on. I think it's rebase, but I just want to make sure.

18:50:38
<transcript>: Cool.

18:50:40
<transcript>: Yeah.

18:50:50
<transcript>: I think I'm mostly done with the sat me stuff. By the way, I think I'm going to get done this week without any problems. I just need to get it deployed so we can start testing it and make sure things work properly.

18:51:03
<transcript>: No. What do you mean.

18:51:07
<transcript>: Like both projects. I've already deployed.

18:51:07
<transcript>: the sst

18:51:10
<transcript>: The sst app into production. I've got to update it.

18:51:11
<transcript>: But.

<transcript>: Okay.
