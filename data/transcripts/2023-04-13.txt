10:36:22
<transcript>: Now that I don't.

00:00:38
<transcript>: Have fun.

00:00:45
<transcript>: You spend a lot of time writing typescript or whatever.

00:00:49
<transcript>: And then you remember that functional programming just makes you think differently about.

00:00:53
<transcript>: It.

00:01:04
<transcript>: Just don't go too far.

00:11:22
<transcript>: would you like

00:11:25
<transcript>: Would you like it to explain what elixir is.

00:11:29
cosmiclasagna: What is elixir

00:11:31
<transcript>: Good morning, frag. Is here. Let's scroll. We got a bunch of macbook, redeemed.

00:11:31

<transcript>: Vim surf. I have not given away a Macbook yet. Vim surface here. Sorry. Should have started with that. No MacBook yet. It's a zero 1%, but somebody's going to win it. It'll probably be frag. He's here a lot.

00:12:19
<transcript>: Good Morning, cosmic lasagna and Development robot.

00:12:19

00:12:38
kryotoboi: Adam gave away an iPod to me in 2005 Kappa

00:12:40
<transcript>: I'd like to thank you guys for following me while I was asleep or while I was otherwise not streaming might not have been asleep. I'm not sure I can't do the math right now. You'll keep waiting, frag. You'll keep coming back, so I'm doing it.

00:12:40
<transcript>: i'm buying

00:12:42
<transcript>: I'm buying friends, basically.

00:12:42
<transcript>: just giving

00:12:47
<transcript>: Just giving you guys a chance in a macbook. I have given away macbooks, though.

00:12:50
<transcript>: So I'm good for it. Okay.

00:12:53
<transcript>: Prime EU time. That's right.

00:12:53
<transcript>: st pe

00:12:55
<transcript>: St. Peoda is here.

00:13:07
<transcript>: What is elixir? It's a functional programming language. It's not Typed. And the lsp when you have a giant code base is very slow, otherwise, lots of fun.

00:13:07
<transcript>: it's pretty fun

00:13:08
<transcript>: It's pretty fun. It's known for.

00:13:08
<transcript>: its like it's built

00:13:12
<transcript>: Its like it's built on top of erlang and it's known for.

00:13:12
<transcript>: concurrency

00:13:22
<transcript>: Concurrency or something like you can spin off all these. I forget the whole paradigm, but spin off all these little subprocess things and you can kill them all individually. I don't know. People get very excited about it.

00:13:23
lasamat: Its not typed? NotLikeThis

00:13:26
kryotoboi: Its not typed its spoken LUL

00:13:30
<transcript>: Good morning. What is it? What is it? Love the aesthetic. Thank you so much.

00:13:37
<transcript>: I've spent a lot of time. My designer friend David, he did all the designs from overlays so I can't take credit for those.

00:13:38
cosmiclasagna: @Lasamat oh no

00:13:40
<transcript>: Cryo is here.

00:13:40
<transcript>: yeah

00:13:47
<transcript>: Yeah. Sometimes I wake up and I'm like, white T shirt today. It's white or black. I've got like six of each.

00:14:00
<transcript>: The thing we're getting rid of. Yeah, I am rewriting the elixir app and astro. But today we're working on the elixir app because this month we're adding some stuff to it before the rewrite is done.

00:14:03
terriblegoss: will you ship the macbook to anywhere in the world ?hahaha

00:14:06
<transcript>: Dm. Boy is here. I mean, Diamond, Sorry, diamond, sorry.

00:14:06

00:14:19
lasamat: Thought Elixir is cool but not typed really bring me down :(

00:14:19
dmdboi: unsubbed

00:14:29
<transcript>: That's so weird to me. It's still so weird to me that through the powers of the internet, we can all hang out together. And it's like different times of the day for all of us. It's just wild.

00:14:31
saint_pyotr: TS devs have been hurt so much by JS that they fear all dynamically typed languages LUL

00:14:35
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Terrible goth. How to get the macbook? You just redeem those points.

00:14:38
<transcript>: You get two chances a day.

00:14:51
<transcript>: And each chance is a zero 1% chance. We've only been going for a couple of weeks, so nobody's won yet. But it's a one in 10,000. It's not bad odds. It's not bad considering you can do it twice a day.

00:14:51
<transcript>: i mean

00:14:51
vimcerf: @saint_pyotr beginThis

00:15:06
<transcript>: I mean, I only stream five days a week so you can do it ten times a week. So what is that? Ten and 10,000. That's one in 1000. Is that right? No, that's not how they work. I don't think that's how statistics work. Pretty sure it's not.

00:15:10
<transcript>: From Shanghai. Wow, terrible Goth.

00:15:10
<transcript>: welcome

00:15:18
fragaverage: yeah you cant add chances together lol

00:15:23
<transcript>: Welcome from Shanghai. Welcome, or welcome from the ozarks to you in Shanghai, China. That's awesome. You just knew you had a feeling little freezey. Okay, I accept.

00:15:34
<transcript>: Good morning, guys. I got wesley coders here. Good morning, wesley. Coter, lil freezey yesterday. Dax on his stream.

00:15:34
<transcript>: said

00:15:36
<transcript>: Said something about.

00:15:36
<transcript>: somebody

00:15:39
<transcript>: Somebody calling me breedable on my stream.

00:15:39
<transcript>: and how he

00:15:44
<transcript>: And how he didn't know how. I didn't think that was strange. I was like, I don't know. It's a compliment. Sounds nice.

00:15:44
<transcript>: breed

00:15:47
<transcript>: Breedable? Why would I complain.

lilfreezi: its in good fun

00:15:56
<transcript>: Adam gave away an ipod to me in 2005. No, I didn't. It's not Typed. No, it's not Typed.

00:15:56
<transcript>: it

00:15:58
<transcript>: It's spoken.

00:16:12
lilfreezi: nothing serious

00:16:12
<transcript>: That's funny. Yeah, it's not Typed in, I think famously, that's why it ended up in the Dog Water tier in prime's tier list, prime and low level learning and trash. Dev did a tier list of programming languages. Elixir was in the Dogwater tier.

00:16:12
<transcript>: because

00:16:14
<transcript>: Because it's untight.

00:16:14
<transcript>: it's not

00:16:16
<transcript>: It's not Typed.

00:16:16
<transcript>: but

00:16:22
<transcript>: But it is fun. You're going to see a lot of it here in about two minutes. I'm going to start slinging code again.

00:16:35
<transcript>: Will you ship the macbook to anywhere in the world? I will. In fact, I shipped a macbook to Italy. It costs $500 to ship it from the ozarks to Italy. Didn't know that when I signed up.

00:16:35
<transcript>: but

00:16:39
<transcript>: But you know what? I took it on the chin. I shipped a keyboard.

00:16:39
<transcript>: kinesis

00:16:48
<transcript>: Kinesis keyboard to iceland. So I'm telling you anywhere in the world, as long as I can legally ship it to you if I can't legally ship it to you.

00:16:48
<transcript>: then i'll

00:16:55
<transcript>: Then I'll have to figure out how to smuggle it into your country. That'll be tougher. We may have to meet in the middle somewhere.

00:16:55
<transcript>: but

00:16:57
<transcript>: But we'll figure it out.

00:16:59
<transcript>: Hello, studio.

00:17:04
<transcript>: Diamond I didn't forget you I didn't forget you.

00:17:15
<transcript>: I've told you I have this map of username to actual name that I call you.

00:17:15
<transcript>: and

00:17:22
<transcript>: And I guess it's like one of those caches that EVIX maybe after time if I don't use it enough.

00:17:24
<transcript>: Frequently enough.

00:17:24
<transcript>: since

00:17:28
ferellon: maybe you could give it away on your boat casino

00:17:37
<transcript>: Since I got to know you then I guess eventually it gets pushed out and it just slipped. But I remembered. I mean, I caught it, right? I was like, dmd. I mean, diamond. Oh, diamond. So I got there. It just took a minute.

00:17:50
<transcript>: Diamond thought elixir is cool, but not Typed. Really bring me down? Yeah, I know. I mean, to be fair, we are moving away from elixir, not because it's untyped, although.

00:18:00
<transcript>: I mean that's I guess. I guess it's part of it. Maybe just like the code base is pretty hard to work in now. It's so giant that it's very slow.

00:18:00
<transcript>: getting

00:18:03
cosmiclasagna: what tech are you moving it to

00:18:05
<transcript>: Getting any kind of tooling to help you with the code base is very hard.

00:18:05
<transcript>: but most

00:18:16
<transcript>: But mostly just not a lot of people use elixir, so it's hard to find people to work on the elixir app because everybody just like typescript, that's everything everybody does now.

00:18:16
<transcript>: st

00:18:23
<transcript>: St. Peter, T. S. Devs have been hurt so much by js that they fear all dynamically dice.

00:18:33
<transcript>: Yeah. Type has become like a big deal in the last few years, hasn't it? Like if it's not type safe, we don't like it.

00:18:37
<transcript>: Hello from Portugal. Welcome to my Chat. W.

00:18:54
<transcript>: It's in good fun. Nothing serious. Well, you didn't have to tell me that little Freezey. I could have just kept on going thinking that it was serious. Eagle, thank you for the follow. I don't know if I saw that one. I'm just kidding. Little Freezey.

00:18:54

00:18:56
<transcript>: Portugal.

00:18:56
<transcript>: we got people

00:19:04
lilfreezi: LUL

00:19:05
<transcript>: We got people from all over the world. I'm in the ozarks, which is in the middle of the United States. If you've watched the show on Netflix, that's where I'm from.

00:19:14
lasamat: Will you use Prime's Chad Stack?

00:19:19
<transcript>: Frag. He's from the UK. England, even Britain. England. What's that one called? The one where London is the capital. What's that country called? I know it's all part of the UK, but like, why you guys got to be weird about that? Why you got to have.

00:19:20
fragaverage: England lol

00:19:21
studiojvla: UK lol

00:19:27
studiojvla: but technically england

00:19:31
fragaverage: Britain is the England, Wales, Scotland land mass

00:19:34
<transcript>: Countries that are like together, clumped and called a thing, I don't know, England. There we go. I know you're from England. We got Portugal represented. I'm sure there's people from Brazil in here because we always have a lot of Brazilians.

00:19:34
whatizit: british empire

00:19:35
studiojvla: and you could make the same argument for Europe lol

00:19:37
<transcript>: We've probably got people from the Netherlands.

00:19:37

daneoshiga: Brazil o/

00:19:51
laytanl_: Yoyo

00:19:53
<transcript>: What tech are you moving to? We're moving to astro, our site to stabus.com. It's like wikipedia for sports information. It's just millions of pages. And we do a ton of Google traffic.

00:19:53
<transcript>: and

00:19:55
studiojvla: I'm from the UK but living in Sweden

00:19:59
<transcript>: And the site right now is like this mix mash of server rendered elixir. It's a Phoenix app.

00:20:05
<transcript>: Slash a react app for parts of it that still I don't remember why.

00:20:05
<transcript>: i don't remember

00:20:10
<transcript>: I don't remember why we decided to build this was like eight years ago. I don't remember why we decided to build a part of it.

00:20:10
<transcript>: as a client

00:20:11
fragaverage: Stroopwafel are god tier

00:20:14
<transcript>: As a client side rendered thing I don't know.

00:20:14
<transcript>: it's highly

00:20:19
<transcript>: It's highly uninteractive. So it's a site that is largely like the perfect use case.

00:20:25
<transcript>: For server rendering, just like generate pages based on data. So we're using astro. It's been wonderful.

00:20:30
<transcript>: Most of the way through the rewrite. But this month we decided we want to go ahead and.

00:20:30
<transcript>: ship

00:20:33
<transcript>: Ship a subscription offering.

00:20:33
<transcript>: to

00:20:38
studiojvla: bitterballer are greater lol

00:20:45
<transcript>: To our users on the existing app before we finish the Rewrite because the rewrite could still take a couple of months. I think it's hard to tell. There's just a lot of stuff we're replacing a very large code base.

00:20:46
studiojvla: but stroop are S tier it's true

00:20:47
lilfreezi: rewrite in asp.net core 💯

00:20:49
whatizit: poffertjes

00:20:50
<transcript>: Is it dark mode everywhere if I use a black and white monitor.

00:20:50
<transcript>: i don't think

00:20:55
<transcript>: I don't think it would be dark. Necessarily. Right? It would just lack color.

00:20:55
<transcript>: but

00:21:00
laytanl_: I am from the stroopwafel country

00:21:01
<transcript>: But if it's black and white, I don't think it's necessarily going to be more dark. You know what I'm saying.

00:21:01
<transcript>: interesting

00:21:03
<transcript>: Interesting question.

00:21:03
<transcript>: logic welcome to

00:21:08
<transcript>: Logic. Welcome to my chat, sir. You are moving to a blazingly fast language. Exactly.

00:21:10
<transcript>: Blazingly fast.

00:21:10
<transcript>: our existing code

00:21:31
<transcript>: Our existing code base isn't slow. It's just slow to author. It's hard to work in the code base because there's so much elixir. And every time you make a change to a file, you can just feel the wheels churning slowly. And it's trying to process what just happened to this text file. And how do I need to present more information.

00:21:35
<transcript>: To this programmer and then eventually like two minutes later.

00:21:35
<transcript>: like the little

00:21:40
<transcript>: Like the little hints will update and be like you can't use that variable. It doesn't exist.

00:21:47
<transcript>: Logic. Thank you for the follow as well. Coming into my chat and following me.

00:21:59
<transcript>: Okay. Will you use prime's chat? Sec? No, but I'm very curious. Like if he builds anything real with it, because that's pretty cool. Wait. Is Chad Sack the one I'm thinking of? Cobalt pascal? Yeah.

00:21:59
<transcript>: alpine

00:22:00
<transcript>: Alpine.

00:22:04
<transcript>: I love that. Because.

00:22:15
<transcript>: Cobalt very obscure old language. Haskell people get really obsessed with Haskell and they're very passionate people. Alpine is just like such a funny choice in that stack to me because.

00:22:19
<transcript>: It's a fine technology. It's not old.

00:22:21
<transcript>: And.

00:22:23
kryotoboi: So today morning in an email newsletter I saw an article titled 5 programming languages that will overthrow python in 2023.

00:22:29
<transcript>: It feels less mimi, but that almost makes it more me because it's in the stack. And then dynamodb is like my favorite database. And I get that people think it's funny.

00:22:37
<transcript>: But yeah, I would almost use that stack if not for the cobalt. I think the cobalt is the thing that just can't sign up for.

00:22:44
vimcerf: my only experience with haskell is finding out a thing in python makes no change, and the reason in the PEP is: "because it's in haskell" NotLikeThis

00:22:48
<transcript>: Okay. We got a lot to do. I should probably get to it. Am I behind the British Empire? British. Britain is the England, Wales, Scotland. Landmass. Oh. Okay.

00:22:48
<transcript>: wait

00:22:50
tymekdev: Hey, hey

00:23:06
fragaverage: The UK includes Northern Ireland LUL

00:23:07
w1tuuu: Yeah, it's pronounced like u said And I'm actually brazilian living in Portugal :)

00:23:08
fragaverage: yeah its dumb

00:23:08
<transcript>: Wait. So there's another name Besides the UK. Are you kidding me? So there's the United Kingdom. And then there's Britain, which is a subset of the United Kingdom. And then there's England, Wales, and Scotland, which are individual countries. And then what's the other country that's not in the land mass of Britain, Ireland? I think I know that actually you can make the same argument for.

00:23:08
<transcript>: europe

00:23:24
<transcript>: Europe countries wedged together. Yeah. I guess that makes sense. Python was happy with duct typing, but now it has more formal typing checking available. Does it really? I haven't used Python in a bit. I mean, since admin of code. And for that a couple of years.

00:23:26
<transcript>: But Python.

00:23:26
<transcript>: doesn't it

00:23:34
<transcript>: Doesn't. It has like official types now like a type system. It's not just like the Dock hints or whatever they're called type hints.

00:23:42
kryotoboi: The list included R, CSS and SQL

00:23:54
<transcript>: Hello from the Philippines. We've got so many countries represented. There are 60 of us here and I wonder how many countries are represented. Please don't spam every country if we get 60 messages now I guess it's fine. I just won't ever catch up. I should just accept but I will not catch up with chat and I need to get to work.

00:23:54
<transcript>: from the uk

00:24:02
<transcript>: From the UK. But living in Sweden, that's the thing about you people over in the UK, over in Europe and other places.

00:24:02
<transcript>: you just like float

00:24:02
tymekdev: @Kryotoboi Lmao, R

00:24:02
ozcap123: it's the United Kingdom of great britain and northern ireland

00:24:17
<transcript>: You just like float around you're from one country, but you live in another. That happens so much in America. That doesn't happen. You might be from one state and you live in another. Now there's a lot of people from other countries that live in the US, but not a lot of US people, Americans.

00:24:17
<transcript>: no

00:24:19
laame: Don't you hop states?

00:24:21
<transcript>: No US people Americans, is insulting right? Because.

00:24:21
<transcript>: there's a lot

00:24:26
studiojvla: lots of americans in Sweden, surprisingly.

<transcript>: Stroop. Waffle, which I don't remember his first name. He just goes by strooper on here. So today morning, in an email newsletter, I saw an article titled, Five Programming Languages That Will overthrow python in 2023. That's funny. Like python is the language to be overthrown.

<transcript>: There's lots of them. And they're all pretty good.

00:26:13
<transcript>: some are

00:26:18
<transcript>: Some are better, but no one language that you need to learn.

00:26:21

<transcript>: or

00:26:32
studiojvla: oh that's neato

00:26:32
<transcript>: Or finding out a thing in Python makes no change. And the reason in the Pep is because it's in Haskell.

00:26:32
<transcript>: what

00:26:39

00:27:06

<transcript>: You guys, you're just all over the place. You're from one country, but you live in another.

00:27:32
<transcript>: you guys

00:27:42
<transcript>: You guys, I say we all just. Everyone just revolt. Everyone else in the world just decides. We're not calling you guys that stuff anymore. You're going to get one country each. That's it.

00:27:48
<transcript>: Northern and Southern Ireland. We might let that slide because of the koreas, but England.

00:27:48
<transcript>: you're one

00:27:49
laytanl_: Wait Ireland is in the eu still?

00:27:51
<transcript>: You're one country, no more special names.

00:27:51
<transcript>: your island

00:27:56
<transcript>: Your island doesn't get a special name just because there's other countries on it. Now the United States.

00:27:56
<transcript>: we don't

00:28:26

00:28:26
<transcript>: lots of

<transcript>: Lots of Americans in Sweden. Surprisingly well, I'd like to live in Sweden. My wife and I have talked about it like if we didn't have kids and we didn't feel like we'd be disrupting their life completely, we would have probably already moved to Japan or the nordic block somewhere up there, Sweden, Norway.

00:28:42
<transcript>: switzerland

00:28:50
<transcript>: Switzerland one of those countries because we read lots of amazing things. They're always on those top lists that Americans make that are like, best Places to live.

00:28:50
<transcript>: and

00:28:54
daneoshiga: python has been historically a great "glue" language.. so it's easy to integrate with other languages.. there's a some python packages that have rust binaries in it for performance

00:28:58
<transcript>: And that's always it. It's like Norway, number one move for the nordic dream. Cry for the darkness. Was it dark? There a lot. That would be sad.

00:28:58

00:29:15
lucyinthesky__: they are great except you will forget what the sun is

<transcript>: bitter

00:29:21
dmdboi: America is oddly never on those lists

00:29:29
<transcript>: stroop

00:29:40
<transcript>: Stroop awful only looks like a waffle. Not really anything else in common, so it doesn't taste like it. You don't put Maple syrup on it is that you're telling me feel like the nl at the end gave it away.

00:29:40
<transcript>: oh

00:29:44
<transcript>: Oh, Laytonel, I got you.

00:29:44

00:29:57
<transcript>: Poffridges.

00:30:10
<transcript>: That's nito. The Irish thing is the whole thing, correct. Although it is a part of Europe with the UK isn't now. Wait a minute. So Northern Ireland is part of Europe.

00:30:12
<transcript>: And the UK is not.

00:30:12
<transcript>: but

00:30:17
studiojvla: part of *EU

00:30:20
<transcript>: But Northern Ireland is part of the UK, so they have a special exception. Is there a Southern Ireland? I have to ask.

00:30:25

00:31:33
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, that makes sense. It's just not in the EU.

00:31:42
<transcript>: Oh, man. Tim. Ooh, thank you for the follow. What was it? Was it the hysterical lack of geographical context.

00:31:42
<transcript>: was it my

00:31:54
<transcript>: Was it my inability to know anything outside of the US? Because I'm a dumb American. Sorry, I'm not dumb American. That's not kind to other Americans. We're not all dumb. We just don't know a lot about the world. Okay.

00:32:07
<transcript>: I grew up in one little spot in the world. I know a lot of things about the little spot I live in. That's basically it. It's okay. I don't know anything about the US either. Like, there's lots of culture things in the US I just know nothing about. In fact, twitch Chat is probably the number one source.

00:32:07
<transcript>: the number one

00:32:12
<transcript>: The number one importer of culture into my brain.

00:32:12
<transcript>: i probably

00:32:20
<transcript>: I probably would know like 90% less if not for being on twitch. So thank you all for keep showing up and teaching me about the world.

00:32:23
studiojvla: though if you ask europeans to talk about the US, outside of NYC, Florida and Cali people are pretty sparse in knowledge

00:33:06
<transcript>: I don't know. Maybe we could drive it. And it was like, oh, there's beaches. Orange beach. In Alabama. It's only 14 hours.

00:33:06
<transcript>: it's

00:33:19
<transcript>: It's a 14 hours drive. I thought the closest beach was like 20 hours. And she made fun of me because she's from Atlanta, and it was like 4 hours to the beach or 5 hours, something like that. And she said only people in the midwest would be like, oh, it's only a 14 hours drive.

00:33:19
<transcript>: it's probably

00:33:22
lilfreezi: road trips are the best

00:33:27

00:33:36
studiojvla: we take trains usually

lilfreezi: i lived in la for a year and i drove there when moving lol

00:33:40
<transcript>: i'm not joking

00:33:44
xborder: but 4/5 hours is reasonable to go to the beach?

There's probably whole countries I didn't know existed that I now know exists because I stream on twitch. It's good for something geographically inept that's such a good way of putting it.

We lived in naples, Florida, for six months and we were less than a mile from the beach. We walk there, like every day. It was pretty great. Then we had another kid and we were like, we should be where our grandparents are or where their grandparents are.

00:36:54
<transcript>: Are just mixing.

00:36:54
<transcript>: and

00:36:56
<transcript>: And matching.

00:36:56

<transcript>: hool

00:37:08
<transcript>: Hooley Stream what's huli living at a 15 minutes drive anything further than 1 hour is no go for me. Wow, that sounds nice.

00:37:10
endingwithali: 🤔🤔🤔😮‍💨

00:37:15
m1lk5hak3r: u r welcome. There is lot more knowledge where that came from

00:37:17
<transcript>: Well, it was nice. We did it for a bit. Mostly in the US. Not here, Adam. It's too early. Adds allie, what are you doing up? And I don't expect to see American friends.

00:37:17
<transcript>: what

00:37:20
privann: SAFe in short = 2-3 weeks sprint with 2 DAYS of meetings in the beginning of sprint

00:37:21
<transcript>: What are you doing? It's too early. Go to bed.

00:37:21
<transcript>: wait have you

00:37:26
<transcript>: Wait. Have you not gone to sleep yet? Because sometimes I see American friends that are still awake. That's weird.

00:37:26
<transcript>: because

00:37:32
<transcript>: Because infrastructure investments are lacking in most States. I forgot what we were talking about. Studio.

00:37:32
<transcript>: what were we

00:37:34
<transcript>: What were we talking about.

00:37:40
privann: @adamdotdev SAFe is for companies to have controll of it's employees

00:37:40
<transcript>: If you ask European stock with us, spend some time living in Dallas for Worth. Yeah. Okay.

00:37:44
<transcript>: Hey, mom.

00:37:47
<transcript>: Are you kids even awake.

00:37:47
<transcript>: okay

00:37:49
<transcript>: Okay.

00:37:49
<transcript>: i'm going to

00:37:54
lilfreezi: ali redeem macbook and then send it to me when u win

00:37:55
<transcript>: I'm going to try and scroll and not read every single message. It's easy. I can skip over all the ones about England.

00:38:03
<transcript>: And no one should use safe? Oh, no one should use safe? I agree with that. I thought you were saying you're trying to convince them that.

00:38:03
<transcript>: they should use

00:38:06
<transcript>: They should use safe. I must or misread.

00:38:10
nexxeln: helllooo adam

00:38:11
endingwithali: No I’m going to redeem and then give it away on my stream

00:38:15
<transcript>: Okay. Germans are in Germany. I understand that. Milkshake. What was the thing about Germany? Did I say something.

00:38:16
lilfreezi: the t3 god is here

00:38:20
xborder: @privann we don't do it like that.. we have a week of planning/discovery/alignment of dependencies for the next 3 months.. than we have sprints (usually 2 weeks) following agile

00:38:22
<transcript>: Exporter used safe at work. I actually worked at a place that used safe. I was not a huge fan.

00:38:22
<transcript>: there's a lot more

00:38:22
endingwithali: 🤭🤭🤭🤭

00:38:23
laytanl_: SAFe is NSFW

00:38:25
<transcript>: There's a lot more knowledge where that came from.

00:38:37
<transcript>: Thanks, Milkshake. Milkshake is here for the German facts. Safe and short. Two, three weeks sprint with two days of meetings in the beginning of Sprint, but safe in large. Here we go.

00:38:42
<transcript>: Safe diagram so that's safe and short here's safe and large.

00:38:45
<transcript>: I don't know.

00:38:52
xborder: to be honest, after a few years, i can say that I hate safe and agile

00:38:53
<transcript>: I just can't. I love working on my own startup with like five other people. This just.

00:38:56
igalklebanov: it doesn't feel safe for developers.

00:39:02
<transcript>: Too many people needing to know too much. And everybody's just making stuff up. That's the thing. I worked in an organization we did safe.

00:39:08
<transcript>: And every meeting, the meetings. We had the ceremony around it, the sprint planning, and then the retrospective.

00:39:08
<transcript>: we all

00:39:14
<transcript>: We all just made stuff up, okay? I was an engineer, an engineering manager. And.

00:39:34
<transcript>: The planning was basically, how long do you think this will take? I don't know, a day. It took seven. How long do you think this will take? I don't know, two weeks. We got it done after the sprint, immediately after the meeting. I mean, it's just like we had no idea we were making it all up. And so was anybody getting anything valuable out of that? I don't know. All the information.

00:39:34
<transcript>: flowing all over

00:39:35
laytanl_: Lol to relatable

00:39:38
<transcript>: Flowing all over the place and the gan charts and the burn downs.

00:39:38
<transcript>: and i don't know if anyone

00:39:43
kryotoboi: Sounds like my every meeting

00:39:49
privann: @xborder there is probably different takes on everything

00:39:50
daneoshiga: I've joined that organization right when they were dropping SAFe

00:39:52
<transcript>: And I don't know if anyone got anything out of it because the data coming in was garbage. All of our estimates, I think are the data going in and they were no good. So I don't know how it works. I don't know how safe is usedful, but that's kind of how I feel about most planning.

00:39:52
<transcript>: i

00:40:04
endingwithali: Ok I’m at the gym time to get SKINNNNYYYYYYYYYYYYY

00:40:07
<transcript>: I like tiny themes where I can just send a dm and that's the extent of my interaction for the day. It's like, hey, could you answer this question for me or hey, did you know this thing? Does this cool talk to you in two days.

00:40:09
cosmiclasagna: oof thats what we're using now LUL

00:40:13
<transcript>: Okay, I got to catch up. I've not caught up to chat once on this stream.

00:40:13
<transcript>: next is here

00:40:14
cosmiclasagna: SAFe I mean

00:40:14
endingwithali: EVERYONE DO ONE SIT-UP!!!!

00:40:14
<transcript>: Next is here.

00:40:19
xborder: @privann for sure. we even took over an call it "The <company-name> Way"

00:40:21
fragaverage: yesss thats how our team is working

00:40:23
<transcript>: Safest four companies to have control of its employees. Is that what it is? I feel like it's so counterproductive. Like it just wastes all your employees time.

00:40:27
<transcript>: Ally redeemed macbook, and then send it to me when you win. That's funny.

00:40:31
fragaverage: I've gone a week or two without speaking to my lead LUL

00:40:35
<transcript>: I'm going to redeem. And next I wanted to say when I saw you next, how did you just join Twitter? And you're so good at Twitter.

00:40:42
nexxeln: LUL

00:40:42
<transcript>: It makes sense because you just started programming in the last couple of years, and you're so good at programming. How are you so good at everything. You start.

00:40:42
<transcript>: but

00:40:46
endingwithali: 🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭

00:40:52
wesleycoder: Guys let Adam work

00:40:52
<transcript>: But like, immediately, how do you skip ahead of all of the painful parts? I was on Twitter for 13 years before I had, like, more than 200 followers.

00:40:52
<transcript>: and i feel like

00:40:55
nexxeln: why do you say so LUL

00:40:57
lilfreezi: @endingwithali my weekly exercise

00:40:59
<transcript>: And I feel like nick's got on Twitter. And the next day, he's like, here's a banger, Tweet. I write in lowercase, like, all the cool people.

00:41:04
<transcript>: I write in lowercase, because dax says, I just copied him.

00:41:13
<transcript>: Speaking of dax, I said dax's name. Will he wake up early just to get on the stream? Because I said his name. Oh, we have to say bad stuff.

00:41:13
<transcript>: we have to say

00:41:21
<transcript>: We have to say bad stuff. And that's when dax shows up. Egal, it doesn't feel safe for developers. Welcome to Chat. Yeah, it's not safe.

00:41:21
<transcript>: okay

00:41:31
cosmiclasagna: dax's beard is bad

00:41:34
cosmiclasagna: is that bad?

00:41:37
<transcript>: Okay, I'm going to scroll, scroll, scroll. No new chatters. Okay, you guys can chat amongst each other, answer each other's questions. I'm going to get to work. Yeah, wesley, let Adam work. It's not their fault. It's me. It's not you. It's me. Okay, so yesterday, off stream. I got something working.

00:41:37
<transcript>: so

00:41:49
<transcript>: So watch this. All this data. You got like 25 rows, 25 rows of data because I'm a paid user, and if I log out, I got to do this, I guess.

00:41:49
<transcript>: let's just

00:41:51
<transcript>: Let's just open a new tab.

00:41:51
laytanl_: I heard Dax looks like an egg

00:41:55
<transcript>: I'm going to log out. I'm going to say, auth.

00:41:55
<transcript>: sign out

00:41:57
<transcript>: Sign out.

00:42:00
<transcript>: Now, I'm just like.

00:42:05
kryotoboi: What charti g library is that ?

00:42:15
<transcript>: A poor free user. And I'm going to ask the question again and it's going to say you get five results. Now what I want to do. So I figured out how to clamp the results. That's good. And I also clamp the number of queries you can do, but I want to make it visually obvious.

00:42:15
<transcript>: that you're

00:42:17
<transcript>: That you're missing out.

00:42:17
<transcript>: okay i want to

00:42:19
<transcript>: Okay. I want to make it visually obvious that.

00:42:23
<transcript>: There is more data that we could give you.

00:42:23
<transcript>: but we're not

00:42:26
<transcript>: But we're not because you're not paying us.

00:42:38
cosmiclasagna: @laytanl_ LUL

00:42:39
nexxeln: pixelate the chart so its not clear

00:42:46
<transcript>: That sounds awful. I'm sorry. Now I know how it all works. Now I know the behind the scenes of The New York Times website when it's like, hey, we have all this great content for people. I'm so glad they enjoy it. Hey, but what if we made some people pay for it? What if you had to pay for all of it? Or what if you can only read one article a week.

00:42:52
<transcript>: That's what I'm doing right now, but I'm doing it for stat. Muse. Am I evil? Did I join the Dark side.

00:43:09
cosmiclasagna: You could make like the fade overlay on medium articles on the rows after the first 5

00:43:13
<transcript>: Pixelate the chart, so it's not clear what I think I'm going to do next is I'm going to scrub all the data. I'm going to scrub the real values and name. Maybe I'll leave the name or something, but I'm just going to show them as like Gray bars that don't have any data on them. And then in the table, it's going to have like a big overlay. It'll just be like junk data, just like emptied out. But it'll have like an overl.

00:43:13
<transcript>: overlay that

00:43:15
wesleycoder: Welcome to the Darkseid

00:43:15
igalklebanov: I did an NBA visualization project in uni. It was fine. weighted graph of all trades in that season, and comparing each player's stats between all teams he's been on

00:43:15
<transcript>: Overlay that's like upgrade to see more.

00:43:15
<transcript>: something like that

00:43:16
<transcript>: Something like that.

00:43:16
<transcript>: can make like

00:43:21
<transcript>: Can make like the fade overlay on media articles on the rows after the first five. Yeah. Exactly.

00:43:21
<transcript>: that's exactly the

00:43:21
w1tuuu: What do you for charts?

00:43:24
<transcript>: That's exactly the pattern I'm going for.

00:43:26
zxshan: On SAFE and agile - “All big methodologies and big application platforms (e.g. J2/Jakarta EE,.NET) are attempts to make average developers predictably productive and to ensure long-term consistency in and across large projects. These things are more important to “enterprise” than raw productivity/development speed.” - quote from YC thread I saw a year ago. Really nails it.

00:43:26
w1tuuu: use*

00:43:27
<transcript>: You heard dax. Looks like an egg.

00:43:27
<transcript>: dex

00:43:33
<transcript>: Dex's beard is bad. Here we are. We're talking about talking about dax. He should show up soon. Right.

00:43:33
<transcript>: welcome

00:43:38
lasamat: How does the natural language search work? Does anyone have any links to read up on that? I want to look more into F#

00:43:46
<transcript>: Welcome to the Dark Side. I did an mba visualization project in uni. It was fine way to graph of all trades in that season and comparing each player's staff between all teams he's been on interesting out egock. That's cool.

00:43:50
<transcript>: Yeah. We built a whole site. A whole thing about sports.

00:43:55
kryotoboi: Make all the bars equal height and have a big fat text saying "Subscribe to see more sensible graphs "

00:43:57
<transcript>: What do I use for charts? We too, or we too.

00:43:59
<transcript>: You know what? I don't even remember.

00:44:03
<transcript>: I literally added these charts. I want to say.

00:44:03
<transcript>: like

00:44:05
<transcript>: Like seven years ago.

00:44:15
binajmen: sup people!

00:44:16
<transcript>: And we've not changed them since it kind of looks like it. Honestly, they look pretty dated, but I don't even remember. We could probably look here. We'll get there at some point.

00:44:16
<transcript>: on safe

00:44:21
joshnerd557: Is there a statmuse for f1 🤔

00:44:36
<transcript>: On safe and agile all big methodologies and big application platforms. Something something are attempts to make average developers predictably productive and to ensure long term consistency in and across large projects. These things are more important to Enterprise than raw productivity development speed. Quote from yc thread I saw a year ago. Really nails it. Yeah. You know what my stance is, zxan. My stance is like all the enterprises.

00:44:36
w1tuuu: @Joshnerd557 that would be nice

00:44:39
<transcript>: It's not looking good.

00:44:39
<transcript>: long term horiz

00:44:41
<transcript>: Long term horizon. I would not want to.

00:44:41
<transcript>: be someone who

00:44:47
<transcript>: Be someone who benefits from enterprises being worth their weight because.

00:44:47
<transcript>: i just think

00:44:50
laytanl_: @joshnerd557 👀

00:44:53
<transcript>: I just think it's not the future. I think the future is tiny teams. I don't know what that means for society.

00:44:53
<transcript>: but i just

00:45:01
<transcript>: But I just feel like there's a whole generation of people that half of them were just sitting in seats. And we just need people to be busy.

00:45:09
m1lk5hak3r: +1 for keeping it small

00:45:18
nexxeln: based take

00:45:19
<transcript>: Maybe that sounds cold. I don't mean it like in a like they're not worth anything. I just mean like so many jobs have been created, especially white collar jobs that are just like you manage people. And I don't know. Maybe I have a really warped perspective. I've only worked in startups. I've really mostly been.

00:45:19
<transcript>: a small

00:45:21
<transcript>: A small company guy.

00:45:23
zxshan: Hard agree

00:45:26
<transcript>: The one company I worked for that had Safe was like 100 people.

00:45:29
smedwardd: and then managers of managers...

00:45:29
<transcript>: And it just felt like, so much.

00:45:32
<transcript>: Playing office.

00:45:32
<transcript>: we're going to play

00:45:33
kryotoboi: Tiny teams ? Hobbits ?

00:45:34
<transcript>: We're going to play, work.

00:45:35
zxshan: Worked in two enterprises, a large one currently - feel the same

00:45:38
<transcript>: I said, at a desk, and I do a job. Look at me. I don't know.

00:45:38
<transcript>: fake

00:45:39
laytanl_: I feel like my manager just dicks around in Jira all day

00:45:40
<transcript>: Fake.

00:45:40
<transcript>: is

00:45:48
<transcript>: Is there a statinus for F one? No. Josh, nerd. We have not considered F one even. But maybe we should. Maybe we should consider F one.

00:45:57
endingwithali: Ok I’m back

00:46:05
nexxeln: add cricket

00:46:05
<transcript>: If you like, ask me every day on stream to add F one. Eventually it's probably going to be like we should add F one. I get that request a lot. How does the natural language search work? Does anyone have any links to read up on that? I want to look more into F sharp. So last time.

00:46:05
endingwithali: Im waiting to see if I get into a class

00:46:08
<transcript>: It's all like a proprietary.

00:46:10
<transcript>: Which is to say bad.

00:46:14
<transcript>: It's all like very heuristic.

00:46:14
<transcript>: and

00:46:16
zxshan: @laytanl_ Same aahahha

00:46:20
wesleycoder: Adam says "The future is tiny teams" while not realizing he is turning into a corporation bit by bit rn with this feature of statmuse

00:46:25
joshnerd557: Sounds like I have a job to do - reminder set 🫡

00:46:26
<transcript>: And manual effort. We use like Stanford nlp, which is sort of like a live. It's like a toolkit. It's like a bunch of little tools for doing tokenization and named entity recognition and all this kind of stuff.

00:46:26
<transcript>: we use

00:46:31
<transcript>: We use that it's written in F sharp, which is like a whole nother thing, because.

00:46:31
<transcript>: stanford

00:46:44
<transcript>: Stanford nlp is written for java. It's written in java, and we have to use this weird. Net java runtime Port thing to use F sharp and interact with those libraries. It's kind of a whole thing.

00:46:54
<transcript>: There's not much you would gain from seeing the code we have talked about open sourcing everything at sap muse. I don't know how much value anyone would get out of it, but.

00:46:54
<transcript>: we don't have anything wr

00:47:00
wesleycoder: LUL

00:47:05
<transcript>: We don't have anything written up. I mean, we don't have anybody in the company that would spend the time or has the time to write up much about all this. This is the extent you can ask me questions and I'll answer them.

00:47:08
cosmiclasagna: having said that, have  you guys thought of using OpenAI's NLP tooling?

00:47:12
<transcript>: This is basically the extent of how much about stat muse's inner workings have been exposed to the outside world.

00:47:12
<transcript>: make all the bars

00:47:20
<transcript>: Make all the bars equal height and have a big fat tech thing subscribe to see more Soonsible graphs. That's funny. What's up, Ben? Admin.

00:47:20
cosmiclasagna: maybe use GPT in some ways

00:47:21
<transcript>: Let's see did.

00:47:26
<transcript>: I'm reading a lot of chat today. I've not done a lot yet.

00:47:26
<transcript>: am i procrast

00:47:32
<transcript>: Am I procrastinating? Or I just like you guys. I think I just like you guys, plus one for keeping it small.

00:47:32
<transcript>: base take i don't

00:47:35
lasamat: I didn't actually mean code more like what do I need to know? So I guess I should read up on NLP and tokens because I had no idea what you just said LuL

00:47:40
cosmiclasagna: yes you are procrastinating

00:47:40
<transcript>: Base take. I don't even remember which take. It was hard. Agree. And then managers of managers. Yeah. Oh, yeah. The whole inefficiency of our economy. Yeah.

00:47:43
<transcript>: It's a whole thing. I do worry about the future.

00:47:43
<transcript>: well i don

00:47:48
<transcript>: Well, I don't worry. I just think at some point, humans are going to have to figure out that.

00:47:52
<transcript>: We can probably with technology.

00:47:58
<transcript>: We can produce enough for the world without everybody having to toil all day you know what I mean.

00:48:11
<transcript>: If anybody read the book sapiens, I feel like there's a future where maybe there's like life after we need to figure out how to survive. Maybe we just like we're in a post scarcity, post survival world.

00:48:11
<transcript>: and

00:48:22
<transcript>: And maybe we're not there yet. I know we're not there yet. I'm sorry. I sound very ignorant. I know that the rest of the world, there are lots of places where you're dealing with survivability. I get it.

00:48:36
<transcript>: But my hope is that less people working isn't bad for society in the long run, because we don't all have to work. We can do things that we're passionate about. I don't know. Maybe that's like some utopian dream. Maybe I'm naive.

00:48:36
<transcript>: tiny

00:48:38
<transcript>: Tiny teens, hobbits.

00:48:38
<transcript>: that's funny

00:48:40
<transcript>: That's funny, not people that are tiny.

00:49:00
<transcript>: Few amount of people. Small amounts of people. That's the tiny I meant worked in two enterprises. A large one currently feel the same. Yeah. I feel like there's a lot of dressing up for work and playing work. I feel like my manager just sticks around today in jira all day or in jira all day. Yeah. Okay. Allie's back. Add cricket.

00:49:00
<transcript>: oh yeah

00:49:09
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. Ipl, yeah, we need to do that. I'm waiting to see if I get into class. Into a class. Oh, what's the class? Thank you for the follow lacerous.

00:49:21
<transcript>: Adam says, what was that? Says the future is tiny teams. While not realizing he's turning into a Corporation bit by bit right now, with this feature of sammy's, it's so true.

00:49:21
<transcript>: we're becoming

00:49:29
<transcript>: We're becoming something I don't even want to be. Sounds like I have a job to do. Reminder set? Yes, Josh F. One. You can even say it multiple times a stream.

00:49:29
<transcript>: have you guys

00:49:36
<transcript>: Have you guys thought of using openai's nlp tooling so cosmic we would be silly not to pay attention to the space.

00:49:42
<transcript>: We are definitely eyes wide open trying to figure out are there ways we can modernize.

00:49:42
<transcript>: our

00:49:45
<transcript>: Our nlp stack.

00:49:55
<transcript>: For a lot of reasons, but mostly just like we want to make sure we're giving the best experience to our users, like people use, that means every day we want them to be happy with it.

00:49:55
<transcript>: and

00:50:05
<transcript>: And if Chat, gbt or gpt four can help us make a better status and we want to do it. But it's still very early, experimental stuff.

00:50:05
<transcript>: we're not

00:50:07
<transcript>: We're not set on some plan.

00:50:07
<transcript>: one

00:50:27
<transcript>: One of the main reasons I would love to modernize our nlp stack is we almost got acquired by Google. I don't even know if I'm allowed to say this. I just don't know the rules around businessy stuff and I don't know legal documents, but there's 100 of us here. It's not a big deal, right? I can just say this. I'm going to say it. Don't clip it, please. We were almost acquired by Google.

00:50:27
<transcript>: it was

00:50:34
fragaverage: If you dont know if you can say it, dont say it LUL

dmdboi: This is a secret between you and all 98 of us

00:50:39
mecoupz: hey everyone

00:50:39
laytanl_: Is there a query that is known to fail? Can you show one where the NLP or query doesn't get it?

00:50:48
<transcript>: It was down to like we thought we were announcing an acquisition to our team at a company outside in Chicago, and it fell through at the last minute. But one of the major knocks that they had was like they were basically buying us for the team, which was small. There was like 15 of us at the time. They were buying us for the team, which is fine. People do aquires all the time. But we.

00:50:51
<transcript>: Had raised our Series A at a $35 million valuation.

00:50:51
<transcript>: so

00:50:55
noctate12: Hi i'm from google dude why u telling this

00:51:03
<transcript>: So they would have to provide quite a lot of capital for a very small team. And they weren't really getting technology they could use because it's a bunch of duct tape and paperclips.

00:51:03
<transcript>: this

00:51:08
privann: Hey, My name is Emil. I work as a legal consultant at Google. I'm bringing this forward.  Dear

00:51:10
privann: Emil

00:51:12
<transcript>: This like F Sharp code base that Google's not going to be able to take anything from that. They would basically just be buying us all of our illustrations and our IP.

00:51:12
<transcript>: and

00:51:13
dontreadmynameoutloud1: does statmuse aggregate data from apis or is it crowd sourced?

00:51:16
<transcript>: And it just like they couldn't come up with a number that would make us happy.

00:51:16
<transcript>: they could have probably

00:51:28
<transcript>: They could have probably bought us for 20 million, but then it's like a pretty significant discount from our Series A, and that means stuff I don't really understand at all. But for investors, I don't know. Anyway, the point is.

00:51:28
<transcript>: if

00:51:38
<transcript>: If we had a really nice stack, like if we were using the latest in AI, it might check a box for some acquirer someday. Not that I'm looking to get acquired. It's not up to me.

00:51:58
<transcript>: But couldn't hurt. Maybe use gpt in some ways. Yeah, I think I just talked about that. I didn't actually mean code. More like, what do I need to know? Oh, so I guess I should read up on nlp and tokens because I had no idea what you just said. So nlp is changing a lot. Lafa we built stat muse in 2014, the first version of it and back.

00:51:58
<transcript>: then

00:52:01
joshnerd557: That’s interesting, I wonder how Google would’ve kept statmuse around - seems very different for a google product

00:52:05
<transcript>: Then Stanford, nlp was like cutting edge. And it's amazing. In 899 years, what has changed.

00:52:05
<transcript>: that is

00:52:07
laytanl_: @dontreadmynameoutloud1 they hired an expert in the industry to fill their dataset

00:52:08
<transcript>: That is no longer cutting edge what we do today.

00:52:17
<transcript>: Or still do from nine years ago is like feels like 100 year old technology compared to what people can do today.

00:52:17
<transcript>: there's just a lot

00:52:19
<transcript>: There's just a lot better ways to do it.

00:52:24
<transcript>: I would not get too hung up on anything I just said.

00:52:24
<transcript>: okay yes

00:52:31
<transcript>: Okay. Yes. I'm procrastinating Chad Jippity if you don't know if you can say it, don't say it. Oh, sorry. Too late.

00:52:31
<transcript>: jet japet

00:52:37
<transcript>: Jet. Japeto. Ooh, that's a good one. This is secret between you and all 98 of us. Exactly. Diamonds.

00:52:37
<transcript>: just

00:52:51
<transcript>: Just secret safe with you guys, right? And we're all good. We're cool. I feel like nothing could be done to me because of something I say on twitch. I don't know why I feel that way. It's like a rapper. Like they can talk about doing drugs because I don't know. It's just a song. I was just pretending.

00:52:51
<transcript>: none of this

00:52:53
<transcript>: None of this is real.

00:52:53
<transcript>: can i

00:52:56
<transcript>: Can I say that in court? I don't know.

00:53:10
<transcript>: Mccoups is here. Is there a query that is known to fail? Can you show one where the nlp or query doesn't get it? Oh, there's Tons layton, most blocks in a game against the Lakers.

00:53:12
mecoupz: is this macbook scam thing still going on? :D

00:53:13
<transcript>: Where the player.

00:53:13
<transcript>: was

00:53:17
<transcript>: Was wearing Air Force one.

00:53:20
<transcript>: That's the highest still wearing.

00:53:23
<transcript>: So like here.

00:53:29
cosmiclasagna: wairing LUL

00:53:32
fragaverage: lol transition

00:53:32
<transcript>: It answered the question. Ignoring all of this. Right. That's one of the hard. Why did I so wearing that way? That's troubling wearing.

00:53:32
<transcript>: oh man

00:53:32
lasamat: Adam in court: "None of this is real. I'll prove it." Logs out of the matrix

00:53:34
<transcript>: Oh, man, that's embarrassing.

00:53:35
privann: we don't see your screen

00:53:45
lilfreezi: very cool keyboard what is that

00:53:49
<transcript>: Where the player was wearing Air Force ones like this whole clause is just ignored and we don't even worse. We don't even know that it was ignored. So that's the worst kind of problems where we don't give you any feedback that we didn't actually incorporate your thing.

00:53:54
dinisskizee: Hello :)

00:54:09
<transcript>: But we try in the nlg here to answer the question in a way that makes it clear what we're answering. So tied for the blocking the most shots in a game versus Lakers with ten blocks. It's pretty clear from reading that answer that we did not factor in the shoes that they were wearing. Right? But there's lots of that type of stuff. I mean, there's just types of data that we don't have, like, we don't have the stats. You don't.

00:54:09
<transcript>: see my

00:54:11
<transcript>: See my screen.

00:54:11
<transcript>: what oh was it

00:54:20
<transcript>: What? Oh, was it like, cut to the camera, the overhead thing. Sorry. Transition. Oops, that's what I get for randomly transitioning to other cameras.

00:54:20
<transcript>: anyway

00:54:21
dinisskizee: it was its fine now :)

00:54:21
<transcript>: Anyway.

00:54:26
laytanl_: Yeah worst cut timing

00:54:28
<transcript>: Maybe you didn't see how I spelled wearing that'd be good, because it was not a good spelling.

00:54:35
<transcript>: Hi. I'm from Google. Why are you telling us? Are you serious? Noctate. Uhoh, are you serious? Am I in trouble.

00:54:41
<transcript>: I honestly have no idea. It might be like silly for me to even think that you could get in trouble for that. I just have no idea.

00:54:46
<transcript>: The thing I know my co founder always said We'd be like.

00:54:46
<transcript>: in coffee

00:54:50
<transcript>: In coffee shops in San Francisco. Excuse me.

00:54:53
fragaverage: Adam has no concept of an NDA :P

00:54:56
joshnerd557: Nah you’re good trust me

00:55:10
<transcript>: We'd be in a coffee shop or an elevator in San Francisco, and he'd be like, dude, you can't say stuff like that on an elevator because these are public companies. And if you say, oh, man, I hope Apple acquires us on an elevator. And somebody's like, Whatever, they can be like, you can't share that. I don't know.

00:55:10
<transcript>: he would say stuff like

00:55:14
<transcript>: He would say stuff like that. And he's probably right. He knew that kind of stuff.

00:55:14
<transcript>: he was from

00:55:24
<transcript>: He was from that background, finance and law and all that stuff. Or he is still from that background. Adam has no concept of an nda. I just feel like twitch is like a safe place.

00:55:28
<transcript>: Where NDAs don't have jurisdiction.

00:55:28
<transcript>: is that a thing

00:55:30
<transcript>: Is that a thing? Can I say that.

00:55:30
<transcript>: is that

00:55:32
cosmiclasagna: @Joshnerd557 source: trust me bro

00:55:46
dinisskizee: @Joshnerd557 PogChamp

00:55:50
<transcript>: Is that accurate? If I say that, does that make it true? Can I say that? Can I say everything I say on this stream cannot be taken into court in a court of law or something. I don't know. Can I say that we're going to try that I'm going to start starting every stream that way. Maybe I'll put some in my overlays. Nothing I say on stream could be taken against me.

00:55:51
fragaverage: Plead the fifth

00:55:52

00:55:52

00:56:04
<transcript>: if

00:56:10
<transcript>: If you guys are all really from Google, don't we have better things to do? Like not get destroyed by OpenAI.

00:56:10
<transcript>: does

00:56:16
adamdotdev: !data

00:56:16
fossabot: StatMuse gets real-time data from SportRadar, but all the historical data was collected by Justin Kubatko, creator of Basketball-Reference.com, who worked as the lead statistician for Statmuse for several years. Read more here: https://www.statmuse.com/product/data

00:56:16

00:56:22
<transcript>: i

00:56:24
privann: @adamdotdev it's true. If you are a company that is public can you get sued for manipulating the stock market as you said "I would like apple to acquire us"

00:56:24
wesleycoder: LUL LUL LUL

00:56:43
<transcript>: I wonder how Google would have kept stapmy's around. Seems very different for a Google product. So they liked that. We kind of like, I think our illustrations actually kind of they were a fan of the the stat muse aesthetic. We were answering. We did a deal with the Google Assistant team. They invested. So I didn't say that Google is an investor of stat News. And anytime, a strategic company, a big company.

00:56:43
<transcript>: like

00:56:52
<transcript>: Like Google or Disney invest in a startup. They are absolutely considering acquisition. They don't invest in startups that they don't consider acquiring.

00:56:52
<transcript>: so

00:56:58
<transcript>: So they invested in us. That led naturally to introductions to Corp. Dev people. And naturally.

00:56:58
<transcript>: those convers

00:57:06
<transcript>: Those conversations happened. It got pretty far into the process. They did a lot of diligence and ultimately fell through.

00:57:08
<transcript>: But yeah, for them.

00:57:08
<transcript>: it was like

00:57:25
<transcript>: It was like that we were already answering a lot of sports questions on Assistant and we were doing this stuff where we were recording athletes and having them in their own voice say it. And they were working on speech sense with wavenet. And we were working with them to get a Wave. Net voice for Scott Vampel and all of that to say there was a lot of synergy in terms of.

00:57:25
<transcript>: like

00:57:36
joshnerd557: SVP love that dude

00:57:39
<transcript>: Like sent me as an idea, just stat me as a technology. Not so much. It would have all been thrown away. They would have just taken us. We would have been some mid level engineers at Google, and we would worked on sports stuff, and that would have been it.

00:57:44
<transcript>: They hired an expert in the industry filter data set.

00:57:45
fyvel8000: HeyGuys

00:57:48

00:57:57
<transcript>: Adam and court. None of this is real. I'll prove it.

00:58:02
<transcript>: That's funny, very cool. Keyboard.

00:58:10
<transcript>: Somebody already answered that. Okay, twitch is a safe place. Adam elmore, 1986 to 2023.

00:58:10

00:58:11
<transcript>: That's really funny.

wesleycoder: Guess it's time to rewrite statmuse with "modern" tech

00:58:29
<transcript>: This stream is an extension of my Fifth Amendment, right? Exactly.

00:58:40
wesleycoder: LUL

00:58:41
<transcript>: Nobody has scammed today are allowed to take me to court. Yes, it's true. If you are a company that is public, can you get sued for manipulating the stock market? As you said, I would like Apple to acquire us.

00:58:55
<transcript>: Oh, it's true? That's all true. Like if I talk about a potential acquisition that's happening or in the works, in a public place, I could be manipulating the stock market. And I can get sued. Who would sue me, though? The person on the elevator, the company.

00:58:56
cosmiclasagna: nothing more modern than the CHAD stack

00:58:57
darkside17_: what's up

00:59:06
fragaverage: If you're listed, the SEC probably

00:59:09
<transcript>: Scp. Love that, dude. Yeah, we recorded a whole lot of scp's voice. He answers lots of stabby's questions. It's okay, adam's. Twitch is ELON's Twitter, so it's fine. Say what you want. Screw up star market all you want. I don't have ELON's money, though.

00:59:12
joshnerd557: The SEC

00:59:14
laytanl_: Sec would

00:59:19
<transcript>: I am like Ultra discount elon, so I would feel it a lot more if I got in trouble. Guess it's time to rewrite sat news with modern Tech. That's right.

00:59:19
<transcript>: wesley

00:59:20
<transcript>: Wesley.

00:59:20
<transcript>: what's up dark

00:59:21
tymekdev: In Poland that wouldn't get you sued, I think you get jail time staright up for tampering with stock

00:59:24
<transcript>: What's up? Dark side. Welcome to Chat. Okay.

00:59:25
tymekdev: Don't quote me on that though

00:59:28
mecoupz: and everything adam says here is in crispy 4k on youtube, so on google servers lol

00:59:39
<transcript>: Oh, now you guys came in and you said the SEC would sue me. Okay, now it's starting to sound way too real. I'm going to stop talking. Let's do other things. Okay. We got elixir to write people. I think this is the first time I've even pulled up the electorate. And we're now 1 hour.

00:59:39
<transcript>: into

00:59:43
<transcript>: Into the stream. Okay. Cool. Sounds good.

00:59:43
<transcript>: so

00:59:48
<transcript>: So here's how we limit answer visuals, but I don't want to do that anymore.

00:59:54
<transcript>: I want to keep them around, but I just want to delete all the data out of them. How am I going to do that? Let's start with.

00:59:54
<transcript>: the table

00:59:56
<transcript>: The table.

00:59:58
<transcript>: No. Actually. Let's start with.

01:00:00
<transcript>: The.

01:00:05
<transcript>: Let's start with the chart.

01:00:05
<transcript>: so

01:00:07
<transcript>: So the chart.

01:00:11
privann: @adamdotdev the person in the elevator could be someone buying your stocks. Also there is probably microphones in the elevator and so on

01:00:12
<transcript>: What is limit? Grid, rows.

01:00:17
<transcript>: I think I need to rename this because it no longer just limits. Grid, rows.

01:00:19
cowfacedev: wait... just as i drop in I hear SEC and suing LUL

01:00:19
<transcript>: It's limit.

01:00:22
<transcript>: Limit.

01:00:22
<transcript>: visual

01:00:23
<transcript>: Visual.

01:00:24
wesleycoder: 1h and 0 work done, looks like a good start, based on my own experience

01:00:28
<transcript>: Grid rows, and.

01:00:28
<transcript>: column

01:00:29
<transcript>: Column, charts.

01:00:40
<transcript>: Okay, Limit visual. Maybe let's go back here and change that to Limit Visual. I have a different name everywhere you look. Limit answer.

01:00:40
<transcript>: okay

01:00:41
<transcript>: Okay.

01:00:50
<transcript>: The person in the elevator could be someone buying your stocks. Also, there's probably microphones in the elevator and so on. Oh, boy, oh, boy.

01:00:50
<transcript>: in poland that

01:00:55
<transcript>: In Poland. That wouldn't get you sued. I think you get jail time straight up for tampering with sock. Awesome.

01:00:55
<transcript>: sounds great

01:00:58
<transcript>: Sounds great. I'm going to stop talking now.

01:00:58
<transcript>: everything

01:01:07
<transcript>: Everything Adam says here is in crispy 4k on YouTube. So on Google servers. Actually, I'm not streaming this one to YouTube. We had an issue with the encoder the other day, and I stopped doing that.

01:01:14
<transcript>: Just as I drop in, I hear SEC. Ensuing. Yeah, Cathace, I may have said some things that implicated me.

01:01:14
<transcript>: they didn't

01:01:17
caasidev: heyup Adam!

01:01:19
<transcript>: They didn't implicate me, but they may manipulate the stock market. I don't know.

01:01:19
<transcript>: i think

01:01:23
<transcript>: I think I'm safe. I think we're good. Cassie's. Here. What's going on? Cassie.

01:01:26
mecoupz: so ideal stream to break some more NDAs haha

01:01:32
fragaverage: You shouldn't be re-streaming to youtube anyway. Remember the partner agreement I told you about before?

01:01:37
<transcript>: 1 hour in work and zero work done. Yeah, we've done a little bit of work. 1 hour and 1 minute. This second hour is going to be so good. I'm going to get so much done. Just watch.

01:01:37
<transcript>: so

01:01:37
caasidev: procrastinating :-(

01:01:38
lasamat: Adam has one foot in jail already

01:01:41
<transcript>: So ideal stream to break some more NDAs.

01:01:43
caasidev: hope you are OK?

01:01:45
tymekdev: @mecoupz NDA breaking speed run when?

01:01:46
joshnerd557: You’re safe I asked Bard

01:01:48
<transcript>: You shouldn't be restreaming to YouTube anyway. Remember the partner agreement I told you about before? I thought frack, I thought, did they remove that thing where you can't multi stream.

01:01:53
<transcript>: Procrastinating hope you're okay. I'm okay, cathy. I'm doing great.

01:01:55
laytanl_: I think you're good now but at the time of possible acquisition you can get in trouble

01:02:00
<transcript>: We've got a pretty fun project this month that I'm doing a sprint on, and I'm enjoying it.

01:02:00
<transcript>: you're safe

01:02:17
fragaverage: No, as a Partner you can stream one place or the other at the same time. They just dropped the exclusivity of partners not being able to stream live anywhere else at all

01:02:17
<transcript>: You're safe. Yes. Bard. Oh, cool. Yeah. Josh, please do let Google know of all of my plans. I think you're good now, but at the time of possible acquisition, you can get in trouble. Oh, boy. Okay. Late. And this is starting to sound pretty serious. So we're just going to move on and pretend like I said, none of this. Maybe I'll delete the vod. We'll see.

01:02:18
mecoupz: you should ask bing and not bard

01:02:21
<transcript>: Maybe felt cute. Might delete the VOD.

01:02:27
<transcript>: Limit answer is paid user true we give you the answer.

01:02:31
<transcript>: Else. False. We limit it.

01:02:31
<transcript>: we limit

01:02:32
caasidev: your top tabs, is that tmux?

01:02:33
<transcript>: We limit the answer.

01:02:33
<transcript>: and

01:02:40
<transcript>: And that is where we're going to come in here and change. Okay. So right here, we update charts. Oh, this is so hard for me to read.

01:02:40
<transcript>: but

01:02:43
laytanl_: @fragaverage I think that is not enforced

01:02:46
<transcript>: But ultimately we come down here and we update each series in the chart. The.

01:02:46
<transcript>: data

01:02:49
<transcript>: Data field. And I think I have.

01:02:53
<transcript>: Got this pulled up here. So data is an array.

01:02:53
<transcript>: of

01:02:54
<transcript>: Of.

01:02:54
<transcript>: the

01:03:01
cowfacedev: well I spent the day fighting jquery datatables, so I am looking at you might be the break I need LUL

01:03:01
<transcript>: The data points in that series. Okay, because you can do stuff in status. Let me show you this.

01:03:01
<transcript>: let's see

01:03:01
cowfacedev: yes @caasidev

01:03:02
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:03:05
<transcript>: Lebron.

01:03:05

01:03:07

fragaverage: @laytanl_ I'd rather not test the decisions made at twitch nowdays LUL

01:03:10
<transcript>: Points per game by.

01:03:10
<transcript>: season

01:03:14
levidayne: An acquirhire multiple years ago isnt going to rock a 1 trillion market cap company.

01:03:21
laytanl_: True

01:03:22
<transcript>: Season. Okay, I know that's a very like, esoteric, weird looking query. Oh, it doesn't work. Oh, no. Did we break this? Who broke this? Oh, no, it's because I have the limiting on. Let me do it on. Stan.

01:03:27
<transcript>: I have my changes in place. Okay. So you can do questions like this.

01:03:33
<transcript>: But I want to do, I want to do it where it groups them. How do I do that again.

01:03:39
<transcript>: Look at all the rows. Oh, why does it not have kobe in there.

01:03:45
<transcript>: No. Kobe did it. Cut it off. Maybe it cut it off. I thought I could do it.

01:03:48
<transcript>: By.

01:03:48
<transcript>: season

01:03:49
<transcript>: Season.

01:03:56
<transcript>: There's a way you can group these and where there's multiple series.

01:03:57
caasidev: thanks @cowFaceDev

01:03:59
<transcript>: By season.

01:03:59
<transcript>: by

01:04:00
<transcript>: By.

01:04:00
<transcript>: years

01:04:02
<transcript>: Years in the League.

01:04:06
laytanl_: But prime has been streaming to both platforms for a long time with no problems

01:04:07
<transcript>: By.

01:04:14
<transcript>: There's a way to line them up and I don't remember.

01:04:14
<transcript>: how to do it

01:04:16
<transcript>: How to do it.

01:04:27
<transcript>: Yeah. And the heck were hire multiple years ago. Isn't going to rock a $1 trillion market cap company. That's exactly right, levi. I had nothing to fear this whole time.

01:04:27
<transcript>: it is

01:04:29
<transcript>: It is tmux Cassie.

01:04:40
<transcript>: As a partner, you can stream one place or the other at the same time. They just drop the exclusivity of partners not being able to stream live anywhere else at all. Oh, I got you. So I can only be one at a time. Okay, well, that's all I'm doing. So we're good.

01:04:46
fragaverage: @laytanl_ Simulataneously?

01:04:47
caasidev: cheers Adam

01:04:51
<transcript>: I spent the day fighting jquery data table so I'm looking at you might be the break I need I might be the break.

01:04:51
<transcript>: i might

01:04:52
<transcript>: I might be.

01:04:52
<transcript>: prime has been

01:04:56
<transcript>: Prime has been streaming to both platforms for a long time.

01:04:56
<transcript>: okay

01:04:58
<transcript>: Okay. Cheers. Cassie.

01:04:58
<transcript>: well

01:05:01
laytanl_: Yep

01:05:03
<transcript>: Well, there's definitely a way to do this. Oh, by day of the week, let's do this point per game.

01:05:03
<transcript>: by

01:05:05
<transcript>: By day of the week.

01:05:05
<transcript>: i just need some

01:05:12
<transcript>: I just need some kind of a time series that's consistent across. Yeah, here we go. I don't know why kobe is not in there.

01:05:12
<transcript>: like kobe

01:05:14
<transcript>: Like kobe Bryant, right.

01:05:18
<transcript>: We want to answer kobe Bryant questions anymore. Out of respect. What is the deal.

01:05:23
<transcript>: And let's do a different player.

01:05:24
winter_squirrel: Twitch basically doesn't enforce it anyways unless you have a huge amount of viewers

01:05:26
laytanl_: His streams are on yt and twitch at the same time

01:05:28
<transcript>: Give me another basketball player.

01:05:28
<transcript>: and shaq

01:05:29
<transcript>: And Shaq.

01:05:35
fragaverage: Interesting

01:05:35
<transcript>: No, it's only doing two players. I wonder why.

01:05:42
<transcript>: Do we artificially limit that now what is going on.

01:05:42
<transcript>: lebr

01:05:44
<transcript>: Lebron.

01:05:46
<transcript>: And Shaq.

01:05:46
joshnerd557: Do you know some crazy off the cuff sports stats working with on statmuse everyday?

01:05:51
<transcript>: For game by day of the week.

01:05:51
<transcript>: shaq

01:05:52
<transcript>: Shaq.

01:05:52
<transcript>: points

01:05:55
<transcript>: Points for game by day of the week. Okay.

01:05:58
<transcript>: Shaq.

01:06:05
<transcript>: Kobe and lebron. Okay, these things used to work. Oh, that's just not right.

01:06:05
<transcript>: shaq bu

01:06:07
binajmen: maybe only using commas ?

01:06:08
<transcript>: Shaq buchanan. I'm sorry. What.

01:06:14
<transcript>: We got some stuff that's not working the way it used to.

01:06:21
<transcript>: Shaq and kobe. There you go. Shaq buchanan. Oh, come on. You know that I'm talking about shaquille O'Neill.

01:06:23
mecoupz: adam has broken it again lol

01:06:24
cosmiclasagna: try shaquille

01:06:33
<transcript>: Yeah. So it groups them into series. That's what each of these is like, a series. So Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. There's three series in this chart. You got shaq and kobe anyway.

01:06:33
<transcript>: that's

01:06:37
<transcript>: That's what this data structure is all about. So if I look at.

01:06:50
<transcript>: Series will be an array of the number of those series in the chart. And then within each series there's data, which is the data points, like going across the Y axis. Does that make sense? Or the X axis? Sorry.

01:07:05
<transcript>: Do you know some crazy off the cup sports stats? Working on stat news every day off the cuff. I used to Josh. I used to. I've been away for three years, so I've just come back in the last, like six months.

01:07:08
<transcript>: Crazy stats.

01:07:09
binajmen: -and

01:07:28
<transcript>: One of the craziest stats in sports. I think it's hardly even a stat. One of the craziest events in sports. And I didn't learn this from sat me. I actually watched it as a Cardinals fan. Growing up, Fernando Tattisse of the Cardinals hit two grand slams in the same inning. And I don't care about baseball. Nobody cares about baseball. Who cares? But that's insane.

01:07:28
<transcript>: like to

01:07:48
<transcript>: Like to have the opportunity. If you don't know anything about baseball, maybe it's like cricket. There's some similarities, but you have runners on base. And a Grand Slam is when you hit a home run, you hit the ball out of the park. When there's the base is loaded, there's three runners on base. So there's someone, a first, second and third base. You hit a home run that's called a Grand Slam. It's four runs. You.

01:07:48
<transcript>: and the three

01:07:51
<transcript>: And the three base runners. Right.

01:07:51
<transcript>: fernando

01:08:05
<transcript>: Fernando Tetisse, Cardinals player hit two of them in the same inning, like their team loaded the bases twice for him, and he hit a home run both times. Just blows my mind, like if that ever happens again.

01:08:05
<transcript>: i will

01:08:06
<transcript>: I will.

01:08:07
<transcript>: Eat.

01:08:07
<transcript>: my key

01:08:10
<transcript>: My keyboard. I don't know. I can't need a keyboard.

01:08:10
<transcript>: i'll do something

01:08:14
joshnerd557: Twice in one innings ? Wow that is wild

01:08:21
binajmen: 100 larabars

01:08:24
<transcript>: I'll do something crazy. I'll give away a macbook if anyone ever hits two grand slams in the same inning again, you come here and tell me about it. And I will give away another macbook twice in one innings. I know. Isn't that crazy? I didn't even learn that from Stamp use.

01:08:38
<transcript>: Okay, let's see 100 larabars. I will eat 100 larbars. Actually, that sounds great. I'm going to need somebody to hit a couple of grand slams in an inning, because I would love to have an excuse to eat 100 Lar bars.

01:08:38
<transcript>: i guess

01:08:40
joshnerd557: The cricket parallel would maybe be an over of all sixes

01:08:41
binajmen: :D

01:08:42
<transcript>: I guess I'd be too many in one setting. I'd probably die or something.

01:08:42
<transcript>: okay so

01:08:44
<transcript>: Okay so series.

01:08:44
<transcript>: we need to

01:08:52
<transcript>: We need to clamp down. Well, we're already clamping down the data instead of like clamping it, though. Right here. We're doing enum. Take.

01:08:52
<transcript>: instead

01:08:55
<transcript>: Instead, we need to do enum map, and we need to.

01:08:55
<transcript>: scrub

01:08:56
fragaverage: What are we doing for the 1 year channel party?

01:09:02
<transcript>: Scrub the data. You know what I'm saying? So let's do this instead of take it's going to be a map.

01:09:02
<transcript>: okay

01:09:15
<transcript>: Okay, I need to turn on keycaster because I should show you all what I'm typing for your benefit. So you can learn something around here. What do we doing for the one year channel party? When is that, frag? When has it been one year.

01:09:15
<transcript>: the

01:09:21
schrew: Gm!

01:09:23
<transcript>: The cricket parallel would maybe be an over of all sixes. I don't know what that means. That sounds way cooler than home run.

01:09:28
<transcript>: Good morning. Shrew.

01:09:28
<transcript>: good

01:09:30
<transcript>: Good morning.

01:09:30
<transcript>: enum

01:09:32
fragaverage: check the date thingy on your shelf... 22nd July I think?

01:09:34
<transcript>: Enum map. Okay as we update data.

01:09:36
cowfacedev: @Joshnerd557 this has happened a few times I think

01:09:36
fragaverage: Few months to plan

01:09:43
<transcript>: Can I do this? Can I just do enum map inside of update in like that.

01:09:44
<transcript>: And then.

01:09:44
<transcript>: the function

01:09:46
<transcript>: The function that we call.

01:09:53
<transcript>: The function. I don't know if I can do this, but the function would be.

01:09:57
<transcript>: Like this update.

01:10:03
<transcript>: Update column I don't know.

01:10:05
<transcript>: Call it.

01:10:10
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:10:18
<transcript>: Update column.

01:10:18
joshnerd557: @cowfacedev you’re right was thinking that, so two overs maybe 😅

01:10:20
<transcript>: Column.

01:10:24
<transcript>: Update in.

01:10:27
fragaverage: And we're also about to smash 4k followers!

01:10:33
<transcript>: Let's look at the data. I don't remember. So inside each data record, we have name, lines.

01:10:33
<transcript>: and then

01:10:36
<transcript>: And then the Y I'm at. Keep the value there.

01:10:36
<transcript>: in the

01:10:40
<transcript>: In the chart but we'll just wipe out the label.

01:10:40
<transcript>: should i

01:10:47
<transcript>: Should I keep the color? Maybe we'll wipe out the color, too. And I don't remember what nameline is.

01:10:47
<transcript>: we'll leave y

01:10:50
<transcript>: We'll leave y? But we'll wipe everything else out, okay.

01:10:55
<transcript>: That's what we'll do. Let's see what that looks like. So update in we need to do.

01:10:58
<transcript>: Let's just start with label.

01:11:03
<transcript>: Threaded let's see something work, label.

01:11:10
<transcript>: And I just need to set the value. It's got to be a function, though, doesn't it? How can I write an inline function.

01:11:16
<transcript>: Inline function inline elixir inline function.

01:11:23
<transcript>: We're also about to smash 4000 followers. It's true. I'm only 80 followers away from 4000, which is crazy.

01:11:23
<transcript>: craziness

01:11:25
<transcript>: Craziness, people.

01:11:34
<transcript>: Can't believe all you followed me. It's amazing. I love it. You keep showing up. I love hanging out with you guys. Thank you for follows.

01:11:34
<transcript>: when to inline

01:11:43
<transcript>: When to inline a function. Elixir. Let's see. Anonymous function. Yeah. I'd like it to be anonymous. Oh, so it's just like that function end. Okay. Cool.

01:11:52
<transcript>: Cool. There's shorthand for doing so. Ooh, so I can just do, oh, that's what this is? That's what we're doing.

01:11:52
<transcript>: that's

01:11:55
<transcript>: That's what we're doing, even.

01:11:59
<transcript>: But I think I'm going to do this.

01:12:09
<transcript>: Well, let's see. So enum math. That's not the case anymore.

01:12:16
<transcript>: It's going to be just.

01:12:16
<transcript>: justine and

01:12:22
<transcript>: Justine, and then kind of just do, like an empty string if I just want to empty it out, kind of do that.

01:12:25
<transcript>: Thing.

01:12:30
<transcript>: No, that's not a thing.

01:12:34
<transcript>: Oh, what mod phone? What's that.

01:12:41
<transcript>: So I just want to update. I want to do update in and just to an empty string. Elixir.

01:12:41
<transcript>: upd

01:12:44
<transcript>: Update and empty string.

01:12:49
<transcript>: Converting interesting. So what I want.

01:12:49
<transcript>: i just want to

01:12:52
<transcript>: I just want to wipe out a field.

01:12:54
<transcript>: String.

01:13:01
<transcript>: Let's add Chad gbt. It's pretty good this stuff.

01:13:03
<transcript>: In elixir.

01:13:06
<transcript>: How do I.

01:13:08
<transcript>: Set.

01:13:08
<transcript>: a

01:13:12
<transcript>: A key in a map to an empty string using.

01:13:14
<transcript>: Update.

01:13:22
<transcript>: In zip. Two or three.

01:13:27
<transcript>: Is it three.

01:13:30
<transcript>: Update in Yeah.

01:13:35
<transcript>: In elixir you can use update Three, along with anonymous function. Here we go, here we go.

01:13:46
<transcript>: Check the date singing on Your Shelf, 22 July What's the shelf.

01:13:54
mecoupz: where is dax?

<transcript>: What are we doing? What's the shelf? What are we going to do? What are we going to do for a one year party? That's going to be so exciting. A year of streaming. It's been such an impactful year. I don't want to get all, like, weird on you guys, but it's really been just a huge deal for me, just my career. I feel like I've been so isolated for so much of it. And since streaming on Twitch.

01:14:08
<transcript>: Last July.

01:14:08

<transcript>: Hello Batchetter bucketer should go through one or two of those in your career, you know, one or two of the performance reviews. Yeah. I guess I've I've not had it a lot of that because I've worked a lot alone. And for my own startup, no one gives me a performance review at my own startup, twisted Seed. Thank you for the follow, too. I like when people say something.

01:15:23
<transcript>: What can we call it? I guess.

01:15:39
joshnerd557: A failed hat trick

01:15:39
<transcript>: Oh, that's what a hat trick is. You say something in Chat, you follow and you sub. You do all three of those things at the same time. That's called a hat trick. I'm not trying to pressure anybody, just saying that's the rules. That's the name. Welcome to Chat. Three Colov.

01:15:39
<transcript>: i don't

<transcript>: can't break

01:16:22
<transcript>: Can't break my bot. Oh, wait, you did the first day you guys broke my bot. Okay, let's do this update and map update in function just like that.

01:16:27
<transcript>: Just like that. I bet dax could have told me that. Even I bet he could have.

01:16:32
<transcript>: Like that.

01:16:36
impostorengineer: Hello world he ment. I think. Just guess

01:16:36
<transcript>: So now we're updating label for every column.

01:16:36
<transcript>: so

01:16:41
<transcript>: So in a map of the column, can I do that? I don't know if I can do it that way.

01:16:44
<transcript>: No.

01:16:44
<transcript>: i can't

01:16:45

01:17:01
<transcript>: That works. Oh, boy.

01:17:01
<transcript>: i just break this out

01:17:03
<transcript>: I just break this out into a different function.

01:17:45
<transcript>: In data and then we do update column on it.

01:17:53

<transcript>: Like that datum.

01:18:24
<transcript>: Datum.

01:18:27
<transcript>: Is that how you call a single beta.

01:18:29
<transcript>: Is that right.

01:18:29
<transcript>: now

01:18:30
<transcript>: Now.

01:18:33
sockthedev: adam has next level production. adam, are you still thinking of doing video on streaming setups etc?

01:18:34
<transcript>: We do update data and then.

01:18:34
<transcript>: what

01:18:35
lesabotsy: Hi all ;) Elixir looks so elegant, pleasing to look at. Then I look at my java code and want to throw up :'(

01:18:41
<transcript>: What's it going to look like? Update chart. No update in and then update series. It's going to look like this one.

01:18:44
<transcript>: Data.

01:18:48
schrew: Datum? I hardly know 'em!

01:18:53
<transcript>: And then down here, update datum. Oh, sorry. Data.

01:18:59
<transcript>: No datum Yeah.

01:19:06
<transcript>: Inside of that, we're going to update. No, we're going to run enum map. It's going to look like this.

01:19:12
<transcript>: I probably could have done this in one function, but at this point.

01:19:12
<transcript>: i'm all

01:19:14
<transcript>: I'm all in.

01:19:16
<transcript>: Update.

01:19:16
<transcript>: colum

01:19:17
<transcript>: Column.

01:19:20
<transcript>: How's that.

01:19:20
<transcript>: i think it's good

01:19:24
<transcript>: I think it's good. Okay, so now we should be wiping all the labels if I did this right.

01:19:29
<transcript>: And there's a good chance I didn't. But datum I hardly know them.

01:19:32
<transcript>: That's funny.

01:19:32
<transcript>: most points

01:19:34
<transcript>: Most points in a game.

01:19:37
<transcript>: Against the jazz.

01:19:44
<transcript>: I bet it's Jordan. I bet he has the most points in the game against Jazz. So now we should have no sure don't.

01:19:48
<transcript>: So what do we do wrong? Update column.

01:19:48
<transcript>: column

01:19:50
<transcript>: Column count.

01:19:50
<transcript>: is unus

01:19:52
<transcript>: Is unused fair.

01:19:52
<transcript>: what did i do

01:19:57
<transcript>: What did I do wrong here? We did update in label so for each column.

01:19:57
<transcript>: each

01:20:03
<transcript>: Each item in data. We should be updating the label with an empty string. Maybe label is not used.

01:20:03
<transcript>: oh or maybe

01:20:04
<transcript>: Oh or maybe.

01:20:04
<transcript>: no

01:20:07
<transcript>: No, that's not the label.

01:20:12
<transcript>: Oh, I actually don't want to do it for every one of them. I just want to do it.

01:20:14
<transcript>: For.

01:20:18
<transcript>: I just want to do it for the last.

01:20:23
<transcript>: Ten of them. Where N is count minus.

01:20:24
schrew: Huh, I guess new orleans jazz does make a lot more sense than the utah jazz

01:20:26
<transcript>: Total right or total minus count.

01:20:33
<transcript>: Sock is here.

01:20:33
<transcript>: sock

01:20:40
<transcript>: Sock is here. Adam Has Next Level Production. Are you still thinking of doing Video on Streamyceps? Yes, I am sock.

01:20:40
<transcript>: i don't know

01:20:45
<transcript>: I don't know that I'm thinking of doing it as a video. I just am going to create something.

01:20:48
<transcript>: I still can't decide what I want to create.

01:21:02
<transcript>: Like Is it a few articles? Is it a few videos? Is it a whole course or something? I want to create something to help other people stream their work. So it's like if you stream on twitch and you're in the creative category.

01:21:11
<transcript>: I want to create stuff to help people do that because it's been such an impactful thing for me. Maybe that's what I'll do. I'll aim for that.

01:21:11
<transcript>: to be

01:21:18
<transcript>: To be done for my one year anniversary. So in the course I can say I just finished up one year of streaming on Twitch.

01:21:18
<transcript>: minus

01:21:21
<transcript>: Minus the three month break. Thank you for the follow.

01:21:23
<transcript>: Deek dkw.

01:21:24
laytanl_: I have no idea what is going on in this code tbh

01:21:26
sockthedev: i would vote course, but have no idea where you will find the time

01:21:32
<transcript>: Elixir looks so elegant. Les is here. Please look at. Then I look at my java code, and I want to throw up.

01:21:38
cosmiclasagna: Jayson Datum

01:21:42
<transcript>: If it helps, it's very slow. I mean elixir is not slow, but working in this code base is very slow, because it's very large.

01:21:42
<transcript>: new or

01:21:49
joshnerd557: TMac is an investor in statmuse? Nice!

01:21:52
<transcript>: New Orleans Jazz does make a lot more sense than the Utah Jazz. Yeah. What is the Utah Jazz about? Why are they the Jazz? You have no idea what's going on in this code. Yeah, it's kind of hard to read.

01:22:01
<transcript>: You would vote course, but I have no idea where you will find the time. Yeah, I don't either. But if I just aim for July, I feel like I've got time. I can get it done before July.

01:22:06
<transcript>: Jason datum. That was a good one.

01:22:11
<transcript>: Tmac is an investor in samuels. Yeah. Tmac.

01:22:18
levidayne: Off topic but what makes astro a good fit for statmuse?

01:22:20
<transcript>: Is we were going to do some stuff with tmac. I don't know if we still are, but like his voice, we're going to record him and do a bunch of stuff with him. I don't remember where it landed.

01:22:20
<transcript>: but

01:22:26
<transcript>: But let's just wipe something else out and make sure I'm still able to wipe stuff out. Let's see.

01:22:26
<transcript>: that was

01:22:28
<transcript>: That was Label. Let's try color.

01:22:28
<transcript>: and maybe name

01:22:34
<transcript>: And maybe name lines, we'll set to let's see name lines, we'll set.

01:22:34
<transcript>: to

01:22:36
<transcript>: To.

01:22:38
<transcript>: Array. Can I do it like that.

01:22:40
<transcript>: And then.

01:22:40
<transcript>: let's do

01:22:42
<transcript>: Let's do color.

01:22:43
<transcript>: Color.

01:22:47
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:23:00
<transcript>: Fun fact. The coolest thing. So we got to meet a lot of athletes and stuff with the Sat music experience, just like recording them. We've gotten to go to a lot of games.

01:23:10
<transcript>: Like cool experiences. But my co founder and I hate to this day that I didn't go. I should have flown to La and done it. My cofounder got to go to snoop dogg's House. No joke.

01:23:10
<transcript>: went to snoo

01:23:13
lesabotsy: @adamdotdev Did you ever meat him? That dude can ball so hard, love him

01:23:16
<transcript>: Went to snoop dogg's house. Snoop dogg. I don't know if he ended up investing, but he was interested in investing.

01:23:16
<transcript>: my co

01:23:28
<transcript>: My covender. We grew up on, like, snoop dogg and all the rappers. We were like, I don't know, athletes in the ozarks. We were white guys that listen to rap. But we grew up on all that music.

01:23:28
<transcript>: and

01:23:36
<transcript>: And he got to drive over in La to snoop dogg's House and pitch him on the whole Stapmese thing.

01:23:36
<transcript>: and

01:23:43
mecoupz: snoops house? he probably didnt come out for a week LUL

01:23:44
<transcript>: And I remember just like getting off the phone with him after he had gotten there. Just how hyped, just how pumped up he was, just the whole.

01:23:44
<transcript>: that's so cool

01:23:48
<transcript>: That's so cool to me. We got to meet snoop dogg over this whole thing.

01:23:48
<transcript>: did you ever

01:23:55
cosmiclasagna: @LeviDayne I'm guessing the dev ex is just so good you can move fast on features and changes -- given that , the code is just REALLY performant

01:24:08
<transcript>: Did you ever meet him? That Duke can be ball so hard. Love him. No, I never met tmac. I think my co founder did. He does most of the traveling. I've got a family. Well, he's got a kid now, actually, my co founder, he's got a little one. I'm not going to talk too much about it because I want to respect his Privacy. I don't know how much he wants to share about his kids, but he's got a family now, too. Back then. Did not. It was easier for him to travel.

01:24:08
<transcript>: and

01:24:14
<transcript>: And he's better at that stuff. Meeting people, investments, all that stuff.

01:24:18
<transcript>: Snoop's House probably didn't come out for a week.

01:24:23
joshnerd557: Oh no way - that’s amazing. How *high* he was after that meeting

01:24:27
<transcript>: I'm guessing the devx is just so good you can move fast on features and changes given that Dakota is just really performant oh, what makes astro? I missed the question.

01:24:31
<transcript>: What makes what makes what makes astro? Where's that question at.

01:24:33
<transcript>: I missed it.

01:24:36
<transcript>: How can I see that question.

01:24:36
<transcript>: oh

01:24:51
<transcript>: Oh, it's right there. Levi off topic. What makes astro a good fit for samuels? Yeah, sammy's is just like millions of pages. It's like wikipedia. So like, astro would be a great technology for wikipedia. Probably.

01:25:00
<transcript>: Like lots of information on pages. Lots of pages. Very little interactivity. Most of the interactivity is just hyperlinks. So it's like this giant.

01:25:00
<transcript>: knowledge

01:25:02
<transcript>: Knowledge base.

01:25:02
<transcript>: and

01:25:08
<transcript>: And the little tiny bits of interactivity are very easy to write with just like plain javascript. You don't have to have.

01:25:12
<transcript>: A whole big React framework or whatever.

01:25:17
<transcript>: How high he was at that meeting. Yeah.

01:25:17
mecoupz: i'd say he was pretty *high*

01:25:24
<transcript>: I wish I remembered more of that story. Maybe he would come on with me sometime and talk about that story because I don't remember a lot of it.

01:25:29
<transcript>: But yeah, got to go to snoop dogg's house and pitch him on stat, muse.

01:25:33
<transcript>: Okay.

01:25:38
<transcript>: What was I doing? Oh, yeah? Do I save this.

01:25:42
<transcript>: And does it work against the Raptors.

01:25:45
<transcript>: The Raptors.

01:25:49
<transcript>: Did we scrub some stuff.

01:25:54
<transcript>: Yes, we did see the colors are gone. Okay.

01:25:54
<transcript>: why are we also

01:25:57
<transcript>: Why are we also still limiting the data though.

01:26:02
<transcript>: Were the numbers or where the rest of the day to go.

01:26:04
thdxr: say raptor again

01:26:05
<transcript>: Like we didn't. We're not doing a take, are we.

01:26:12
<transcript>: Ada update datum. We're not limiting the number of them anymore. So where are they.

01:26:16
<transcript>: I am confused.

01:26:16
<transcript>: i am

01:26:18
<transcript>: I am very confused.

01:26:23
<transcript>: Why would that be the case.

01:26:35
<transcript>: Categories. Oh, because we're only taking that many categories up here. Okay. So if I do that now.

01:26:42
<transcript>: It should work against the Clippers.

01:26:45
<transcript>: Now it should show all of them.

01:26:45
<transcript>: and they're all

01:26:49
<transcript>: And they're all going to be black, and they're all going to be lacking data.

01:26:50
<transcript>: So.

01:26:54
<transcript>: They don't have the Layel in there.

01:26:59
<transcript>: That's a bummer that has that little straggling points thing.

01:27:03
joshnerd557: What’s your best experience you’ve been able to have with statmuse?

01:27:08
<transcript>: These are the categories. So I need to remove from only the last whatever number of them count a total minus count. I need to remove these.

01:27:18
<transcript>: Say wrapped her again a Raptor? Did I say it right, Raptor.

01:27:18
<transcript>: rapt

01:27:30
<transcript>: Raptor I was joking when I said Raptors, that was a joke. Oh, did I say that? I said Raptors, that was a joke. Dax, I was just being stupid. Sometimes it's not because I'm from the ozarks. It's just me being stupid.

01:27:30
<transcript>: and not stupid

01:27:31
thdxr: phew

01:27:34
<transcript>: And not stupid, but like messing around. You know what I'm saying.

01:27:35
thdxr: can't tell with you

01:27:42
<transcript>: Few. They're not called Raptors. What are you talking about? Can't tell with me. Yeah. There's a lot of things. I just don't know.

01:27:42
<transcript>: i've had very

01:27:44
kiwifromearth: its not ok

01:27:45
nft_scam: raptour sounds kinda nice tho

01:27:45
<transcript>: I've had very limited life experiences. It's true.

01:27:45
<transcript>: josh

01:27:49
<transcript>: Josh, what's your best experience you've been able to have with sap, muse.

01:27:51
<transcript>: There's been a lot.

01:27:59
<transcript>: Rapdoor sounds kind of nice, though. Yeah, it kind of does.

01:28:03
earholesmcgee: 71 ina game, god damn

01:28:03
<transcript>: The best experience I've had with stat muse.

01:28:10
<transcript>: Well, early on. I think I told this yesterday, even like in the first.

01:28:10
<transcript>: twenty four

01:28:14
<transcript>: 24 hours after we launched our private beta.

01:28:20
<transcript>: Like we put a video of stat muse on Twitter.

01:28:20
<transcript>: and

01:28:40
<transcript>: And 24 hours later, we had emails from the League from teams. And we were invited by Dan gilbert, owner of the Cleveland cavaliers, to fly to the Cleveland cavaliers home opener. Lebron James was coming back from four years in Miami. He had been with the Heat. He was coming back as a hometown hero to Cleveland. Major storyline we were so hyped for it all summer, just like as NB.

01:28:40
<transcript>: nba f

01:28:48
<transcript>: Nba fans. And then we got to go to the home opener. We got to go into the owner's box with Dan gilbert and meet usher and Michael strahan. Randomly.

01:28:48
<transcript>: usher

01:28:54
nft_scam: oooooooo

01:29:07
<transcript>: Usher was there to sing the national anthem. Michael strahan was just there because he's a celebrity, and he wanted to be there and hang out. So we got to go this, like, cool, inner room. It's a queue in Cleveland, which is the Stadium there. And there's this inner room with no windows. And they had all this food, catered and stuff. And that's where usher, Michael strahan, Dan gilbert and a bunch of other random people are hanging out.

01:29:07
<transcript>: and he

01:29:19
<transcript>: And he introduces us to usher and usher's wife. It was the most surreal thing in the world. I tripped over usher's wife. Felt like an idiot. I'm kind of big and clumsy, but I got a picture with Michael strayhan. I'll pull it up here in a second.

01:29:34
<transcript>: And he pulls up like a computer in the corner has our logo on it. And it's our video. And he played the video for the room. We have, like, a video. I'm like, in the back with my camera, my phone just taking a video of, like, Dan gilbert talking about this video.

01:29:34
<transcript>: in this like forty eight hour

01:29:43
joshnerd557: Oh man, chills- that’s got to be so surreal. I don’t know how I’d feel in that moment.. absolutely crazy

01:29:50
<transcript>: In this, like, 48 hours after we launched this thing. So we were, nobodies, we had, like, not told anybody we were doing. And then within 48 hours, we're, like, sitting in Cleveland at the cavs Game next, full of bronze kids courtside. It was just surreal. It was crazy. So that was an amazing experience.

01:29:56
<transcript>: That was like, right off the bat. And that's kind of like launched that music into what it became.

01:29:57
f0ll0w: bruh, congrats on that experience

01:29:58
joshnerd557: Just off the video?? They didn’t even have access to the beta?

01:29:59
kiwifromearth: splendid

01:30:06
<transcript>: Well, it didn't really lie. I mean, I say launched it. It's been nine years and only really in the last year are we really seeing the frees of being alive for nine years.

01:30:06
<transcript>: sat me

01:30:10
<transcript>: Sat me is just going a ton in the last year and really.

01:30:10
<transcript>: it was like

01:30:24
<transcript>: It was like this major high at the beginning, where Dan gilbert's going to invest. We're going to build technology for Quicken loans, I guess. And everything's amazing. And then we went, like a year and had a hard time raising our seed. Then once we raise our seed.

01:30:24
<transcript>: we immediately raise

01:30:31
<transcript>: We immediately raise our A within like three months of closing our sea. Disney led a $10 million a Google invested in RA.

01:30:31
<transcript>: rand

01:30:31
<transcript>: rand things

01:30:38
<transcript>: Rand things picked up again, but it's just startups are so up and down, like there were so many up and down experiences.

01:30:47
<transcript>: You're on top of the world. You're going to be a billionaire at one point, and then the next day, you're like, this is the dumbest idea we've ever had. No one is going to use this. Why are we building it.

01:30:47
<transcript>: that's just kind of

01:30:50
<transcript>: That's just kind of life as a startup vendor.

01:30:50
<transcript>: but

01:30:59
<transcript>: But other cool experiences meeting some of my heroes in sports. So we got to record like peyton Manning and Jerry rice.

01:31:09
<transcript>: In the booth. Who else? We also just recorded, like, a bunch of random NFL players that were really good one year, and then they just fell off a cliff, like David Johnson.

01:31:09
<transcript>: we recorded

01:31:14
<transcript>: We recorded him at like peak. David Johnson might be the MVP, and then.

01:31:14
<transcript>: he's a running

01:31:17
<transcript>: He's a running back so no one ever heard from me again.

01:31:17
<transcript>: recorded

01:31:36
<transcript>: Recorded Drew brees and kurt Cousins. And these are not highlights. These are just like NFL players we got in the studio with. Oh, another career highlight. We built an experience for the Profitball Hall of Fame, which, if you know me, if you've hung out here on my stream a little bit, you know that. I'm just kind of like, all over the place.

01:31:42
<transcript>: I like sprinting. I was a sprinter in high school. That's what I'm good at.

01:31:59
<transcript>: I like taking on a project, letting it consume my essence, my entire personhood. I am enveloped in this project, and I want to knock it out in, like, a month. And that's my favorite thing in the world to do. And we did this project for the Profile Hall of Fame.

01:32:04
<transcript>: And they wanted it launched for the Super Bowl, and we had, like, literally five weeks to build this thing.

01:32:04
<transcript>: we have no experience

01:32:16
<transcript>: We have no experience with any of the technology. It was an AR experience where you could hold up an ipad in the Pro Football Hall, Fame, there in canton, and through the true depth camera.

01:32:18
<transcript>: It was seen.

01:32:18
<transcript>: well

01:32:30
<transcript>: Well, the true depth camera is a separate conversation, actually, just through the normal camera on the ipad. We did an AR scene where we replaced John madden's bust in the hall of Fame, his bronze bust with a virtual bus.

01:32:30
<transcript>: that could

01:32:37
<transcript>: That could talk, and you could ask it questions. Because what we do is conversational technology, like we build natural language processing stuff.

01:32:44
<transcript>: So you could ask it like, what was like to win Super Bowl. And then he'd go into this big story. And his bus would be like, animated.

01:32:52
<transcript>: That was a huge highlight of mine, because one, it was just really cool. We got to go to the studio. John Man has a studio out there in California.

01:33:10
<transcript>: Fun fact. He watches every Sunday, he watched Rest in Peace. He watched every football game with all of his friends in that studio that had this giant room with this giant projector. And they just like catered. And every Sunday came and watched football on this giant movie theater screen.

01:33:10
<transcript>: but right

01:33:12
fragaverage: Got a link to that initial video?

01:33:16
mecoupz: https://twitter.com/UmarBzv/status/1646184939488985091?s=20

01:33:22
earholesmcgee: what a legend

01:33:27
<transcript>: But right next to that his little booth. And we just recorded him for a few hours telling stories so fun. We built all this motion capture technology again. Five weeks, we had to build motion capture technology and Unity that captured using the ipad True Depth camera. It captured his facial animations as he spoke.

01:33:27
<transcript>: so we recorded

01:33:44
<transcript>: So we recorded him telling stories for like 3 hours. And then we use the audio and the motion capture data to drive this rig that we had an Activision artist. Animate he's like one of the blizzard artists. He does a bunch of World of warcraft 3d work and we just hired him to build.

01:33:44
<transcript>: this

01:33:55
<transcript>: This John madden rig that at first we bought 3d scanners. And we flew to canton and scanned the bust, learned how to do that. That was fun.

01:34:03
<transcript>: Did all this in five weeks, though we had to learn how to drive a 3d rig and how to use augmented reality and all these things.

01:34:03
<transcript>: the

01:34:09
<transcript>: The conversational piece was pretty easy. We just use snips. Ai, which is like a natural language processing thing.

01:34:22
<transcript>: It was really cool. And then I got to go to the Super Bowl and show it off at the Super Bowl. They have, like, this Super Bowl experience week, where a bunch of people come and you can like, I don't know. It's like the week leading up to the Super Bowl.

01:34:22
<transcript>: it was

01:34:25
<transcript>: It was in Atlanta that year.

01:34:25
<transcript>: and

01:34:26
thdxr: I could have done it in 4 weeks

01:34:41
<transcript>: And got to set at the profitball hall of Fame booth with a bunch of hall of famers that would come by terrell Davis, and all these people would come by actual players. And we get to show them this experience where it's going to be in canton later. But here it is. So that was really cool. Okay. Anyway.

01:34:41
<transcript>: dax could have

01:34:44
<transcript>: Dax could have had it done in four weeks. So there you go.

01:34:51
<transcript>: It's got to be so surreal. I don't know how I'd feel in that moment. Absolute crazy. It really was nuts. It was a wild way to start.

01:34:55
<transcript>: The sat me story we really didn't know for sure.

01:34:55
<transcript>: if we even

01:34:59
<transcript>: If we even had something we knew we loved playing with it.

01:34:59
<transcript>: when i

01:35:07
<transcript>: When I fit my co founder the first email with like a prototype. I'd spent a couple of months scraping mba.com and building like a little prototype.

01:35:07
<transcript>: he

01:35:11
joshnerd557: This is seriously so impressive and interesting. Thank you for telling these stories- it’s actually inspiring

01:35:21
<transcript>: He and this is like legend. Now in stat muse canon. He spent all night. He stayed up all night that first night just playing with that music because it was really fun. It was really fun to just ask questions of all this NBA data as NBA fans.

01:35:29
<transcript>: And so we knew, like, we love this. We're having a lot of fun with it. In fact, it was hard for me to build new features because I was having so much fun just playing with it.

01:35:37
<transcript>: But we didn't know for sure that we were going to put it out there to the world and that people were going to like it. We didn't know if we were just, I don't know.

01:35:37
<transcript>: stat nerd

01:35:39
<transcript>: Stat nerd that cared about this stuff or whatever.

01:35:39
<transcript>: okay

01:35:45
<transcript>: Okay, got a link to that initial video. Ooh, frag, maybe.

01:35:49
<transcript>: My co founder does he has the official archives.

01:35:55
<transcript>: He's got all the stuff. The video of me taking a video in Dan.

01:35:55
<transcript>: 's

01:36:04
<transcript>: 's in the inner what they call it the vault at the queue. It's like the secret Room and the inside of the Stadium.

01:36:08
<transcript>: He's got that cell phone video. He's got the original demo video that we put on the internet.

01:36:15
<transcript>: He's got a ton of stuff, just all the kind of fun story pieces. I'll ask him for some of that so I can share it with you guys.

01:36:24
<transcript>: Just stopped the video. They didn't even have access to Beta. Yeah. So Josh, just off the video. We literally put a video on the Internet. And we said.

01:36:35
<transcript>: Share this our site. It was like a referral thing we built, and the more you share it, the sooner you'll get access to the private beta and people shared it.

01:36:35
<transcript>: like

01:36:39
<transcript>: Like crazy. We blew up. I mean on Twitter.

01:36:41
<transcript>: It was like, I think.

01:39:04
<transcript>: Psychedelic platypus thank you so much for the follow as well.

01:39:04
<transcript>: okay

01:39:07
<transcript>: Okay. So what we got to do here.

01:39:09
<transcript>: What we got to do is.

01:39:12
<transcript>: We've got to.

01:39:12
<transcript>: so

01:39:13
<transcript>: So.

01:39:13
<transcript>: we're not

01:39:15
<transcript>: We're not.

01:39:15
<transcript>: taking in number

01:39:17
<transcript>: Taking in number of categories.

01:39:17
<transcript>: we're wiping

01:39:25
<transcript>: We're wiping the rest of them. How do I want to do that? So in elixir, let's just go back to chat gbt because it answers all of our questions.

01:39:27
<transcript>: Okay.

01:39:30
<transcript>: If I have a list.

01:39:33
<transcript>: In elixir, and.

01:39:36
<transcript>: I want to.

01:39:40
<transcript>: Write no.

01:39:40
<transcript>: i want

01:39:41
zeejayym: hey look @thedevdad_

01:39:42
<transcript>: I want to scrub.

01:39:45
<transcript>: Scrub data from.

01:39:45
<transcript>: keys

01:39:47
<transcript>: Keys in.

01:39:47
<transcript>: the last

01:39:49
<transcript>: The last in objects.

01:39:52
<transcript>: How would I do that.

01:39:55
<transcript>: Let's see what it says.

01:40:09
<transcript>: What web stack would you use today for a new project? I have a few in mind but don't know enough. I don't want to invest some time in one and having to rewrite later. What kind of project is it lesa like? Is it.

01:40:09
<transcript>: and

01:40:20
<transcript>: And I know this isn't a pure, like a great distinction. People have problems with this, but is it a site or an app? I know that's not perfect, but it's something.

01:40:23
<transcript>: Is it highly interactive.

01:40:29
<transcript>: How many people use the thing like, will it be a thing that hopefully a lot of people use.

01:40:29
<transcript>: or only a small

01:40:32
whatizit: you are so polite to chatgpt

01:40:34
<transcript>: Or only a small group of people that will use it a lot. Does that make sense if you can answer those two questions.

01:40:34
<transcript>: that

01:40:36
<transcript>: That'll help, I think.

01:40:36
<transcript>: why

01:40:36
mono_nz: ooo, you've added Kotlin to your tags. so you've mastered it now right? excellant

01:40:40
<transcript>: Why are you so polite to chat? You be.

01:40:40
<transcript>: yeah

01:40:41
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:40:45
<transcript>: I am polite at times because.

01:40:45
<transcript>: i feel like it

01:40:49
<transcript>: I feel like it can't hurt just be kind can't hurt.

01:40:52
<transcript>: You've had a collin tier tag. So you've mastered it now, right.

01:40:52
<transcript>: no

01:40:58
<transcript>: No mono. I have not. I forgot about Tags on twitch. What are my other tags? I don't even know.

01:40:58
<transcript>: i

01:41:06
<transcript>: I did kotlin for like a week because we're building rebase TV and I guess I made it a tag.

01:41:06

01:41:35
<transcript>: aw

01:41:40
<transcript>: Awful lot. Thank you for the prime sub. I said it before I'll say it again. Prime sub.

01:41:40
<transcript>: they

01:41:43
log4jackie: @thdxr Puttin GPT in its place DarkMode

01:41:45
tymekdev: @thdxr We are safe everyone, Dax is the first one on the list when machines rise up

01:41:52
<transcript>: They hit different. They feel special. You gave me your one prime sub. As far as I know, you only get one prime sub, and you gave it to me. And that means something to me. It really does. Honestly.

01:41:57
ocelot2123: I honestly forget to my prime sub every month LUL

01:42:00
<transcript>: I'm always nice to Chat. Gbt two. Yes. Psychedelic platypus. Welcome to Chat. I just figure it can't hurt.

01:42:00
<transcript>: like robo

01:42:05
<transcript>: Like robots. They're not people, but they're trained on people. Data.

01:42:05
<transcript>: you think they're going to be

01:42:06
<transcript>: You think they're going to be.

01:42:06
<transcript>: just as

01:42:07
ocelot2123: use*

01:42:10
<transcript>: Just as kind to you if you're a jerk to them. I don't think so.

01:42:10
<transcript>: okay so

01:42:12
whatizit: i feed it nothing but broken sentences and unreasonable demands

01:42:15
<transcript>: Okay, so here's what they did. Scrub keys, enum, reduce.

01:42:23
<transcript>: Okay. So we're going to have to do some stuff like this. We're going to have to say, take the last in by splitting.

01:42:23
<transcript>: oh that's kind

01:42:26
<transcript>: Oh, that's kind of cool, so split.

01:42:29
<transcript>: Gives you you can get the head.

01:42:29
<transcript>: and then

01:42:32
<transcript>: And then last in.

01:42:33
lesabotsy: @adamdotdev All apps, few people but using it often if any takes off, all highly interactive with data visualization.

01:42:35
<transcript>: Wait. Is that like a name? That.

01:42:35
<transcript>: 's

01:42:39
<transcript>: 's sensitive or can you name these anything you want.

01:42:47
<transcript>: Split. Okay. And then scrubbed last in enum map, last in scrub keys. Okay.

01:42:47
<transcript>: and then

01:42:48
thdxr: can name thos anything

01:42:51
<transcript>: And then wait. Head plus plus scrubbed last in wait. What's that? Do.

01:42:56
<transcript>: Wait. Is this recursive? No.

01:43:00
<transcript>: What does this do.

01:43:04
thdxr: this seems wrong

01:43:08
thdxr: is this elixir lol

01:43:09
<transcript>: Oh, it's going to tell me this example script is a list, an integer and list of key scrub spits the input into two parts. The head, everything except the last thing.

01:43:09
<transcript>: object and the last

01:43:15
<transcript>: Object and the last in objects. Then it processes the last name object by calling private script fee function.

01:43:15
<transcript>: finally

01:43:16
<transcript>: Finally.

01:43:24
<transcript>: It concatenates. Oh, that's concatenating. Yeah. So we want the head, and then we want the scrubbed version. Oh, that's so obvious. Yeah. Okay. Feels good.

01:43:28
<transcript>: And then there we go. So that's how we're going to do it. Okay.

01:43:32
lesabotsy: @adamdotdev oh and on real estate listing website in a niche

01:43:46
<transcript>: We'll catch up on Chat. If I would do a new project, I would try out Leftos Rs coming from php. You said Hello to me from the raid. I did say Hello to you, zj. Oh, that's what it was. I said Hello to you when you rated and then you followed. I appreciate it. Also. Dank buns I appreciate that. Follow.

01:43:49
<transcript>: The buns, they're dank.

01:44:08
<transcript>: I'll see putting gpt in its place. We save everyone. Dax is the first one on the list when the machines rise up. Exactly. Honestly, forget to my prime sub every month. Well, I'm glad you didn't forget to use it this month. I'm so glad you used it on me. Oz. A lot. I feed it. Nothing but broken sentences in unreasonable demands.

01:44:19
<transcript>: Okay, Lisa, all apps few people but using it often if any, takes off all highly interactive with data vision. Okay.

01:44:24
<transcript>: And on Real estate listing website.

01:44:24
<transcript>: in

01:44:27
<transcript>: In a niche on real estate. Okay.

01:44:29
<transcript>: So.

01:44:29
<transcript>: i think

01:44:30
<transcript>: I think.

01:44:34
<transcript>: This seems wrong. Oh, no, dax, is that the code is wrong.

01:44:34
<transcript>: can name

01:44:37
mecoupz: i didnt even know about prime subs before i started watching adam, because i didnt watched any streams on twitch

01:44:39
<transcript>: Can name those anything. This seems wrong. Is this elixir? Oh, Jeez.

01:44:39
<transcript>: oh

01:44:43
<transcript>: Oh, could you give me let's do this could you give me.

01:44:46
<transcript>: A more idiomatic.

01:44:52
<transcript>: And idiomatic. I always spell that wrong. Idiomatic. Elixir.

01:44:52
<transcript>: vers

01:44:54
<transcript>: Version.

01:44:56
<transcript>: And.

01:45:07
<transcript>: Simpler, maybe. Okay. So, Lisa, I think we could call what you're doing? A single page application. I think we can call it a spa if you will. So if.

01:45:07
<transcript>: you're building

01:45:09
<transcript>: You're Building applications.

01:45:11
cedpoilly: Hello everyone. Hello @adamdotdev

01:45:14
<transcript>: My recommendation. And this may not be conventional wisdom. So I guess.

01:45:14
<transcript>: the mid answer is

01:45:22
<transcript>: The mid answer is just use nextjs because everybody uses nextjs and everybody uses react and you'll have plenty of other people.

01:45:26
<transcript>: To bond with as you enter into the React community.

01:45:26
<transcript>: that's

01:45:30
<transcript>: That's the mid answer. Just use nextjs. It's like the default.

01:45:47
<transcript>: But if you want to get a little spicy, then I would say you Solid, and you could use Solid Start. I don't know, dax, if you recommend for new people to use Solid Start or use astro Plus Solid or something else, but solid.

01:45:49
<transcript>: I think.

01:45:49
<transcript>: is

01:45:50
<transcript>: Is the future.

01:45:50
<transcript>: more

01:46:00
thdxr: solid start shifting around too much

01:46:04
<transcript>: More so than react. Think react is old news. I mean, it's going to have a long tail and it's going to be the predominant thing for forever. But I think the mind share is shifting towards solid. It's simpler.

01:46:04
<transcript>: solid start

01:46:08
thdxr: Astro + solid good for public sites

01:46:10
<transcript>: Solid starts shifting around too much? Oh, solid start is shifting around too much? So not solid start? Maybe astro. Plus solid.

01:46:10
<transcript>: that's

01:46:12
<transcript>: That's a lot to learn.

01:46:16
earholesmcgee: Agreed. Were moving to a world where we use Solid, Rust and Go

01:46:19
<transcript>: But let me know what your thoughts are. I didn't even know about Prime Subs before I started watching Adam because I didn't watch any streams on Twitch.

01:46:19
<transcript>: interesting

01:46:38
<transcript>: Interesting. Because did I bring you to twitch? Said qualies. Here, said polly. I took a break and I haven't seen you in a while. And I miss you and welcome. Hello. Hello, said pauli Ashropasala. Good for public sites. Okay. Agreed. We're moving to a world where we use solid rust and go.

01:46:43
mecoupz: @adamdotdev "kind of"

01:46:44
<transcript>: Okay.

01:46:44
<transcript>: this

01:46:48
<transcript>: This version is more idiomatic. Does this look like elixir.

01:46:50
<transcript>: Dax.

01:46:54
<transcript>: You're so particular? Dax. Does this look like elixir.

01:46:54
<transcript>: length

01:46:58
cedpoilly: Awww. Yeah. Glad to be back on your stream. Hope all is well

01:47:06
mecoupz: i was here on twitch maybe 1 or 2 times for ~10min watching prime and leaved, not really watched longer streams before

01:47:07
<transcript>: Length lengthless enum map indexed list function item index index greater than length minus n. Do scrub keys else item that looks like good elixir. What do you think.

01:47:07
<transcript>: what do you

01:47:09
<transcript>: What do you think.

01:47:16
<transcript>: Glad to be back on your stream. Hope all is well, it's great, said Polly.

01:47:16
<transcript>: took

01:47:23
<transcript>: Took a break over the holidays, just kept taking a longer break and then I eventually came back and it's been really good to be back.

01:47:23
<transcript>: i got

01:47:27
thdxr: IDK

01:47:28
<transcript>: I got partner. So I'm a partner on twitch now, which just means I have a nice little.

01:47:31
<transcript>: Badge.

01:47:31
<transcript>: look at my

01:47:31
adamdotdev: look at my badge

01:47:33
<transcript>: Look at my badge.

01:47:38
<transcript>: You don't know? Dax. Does this still not look like elixir.

01:47:38
<transcript>: i was

01:47:50
<transcript>: I was here on twitch, maybe one or two times for ten minutes, watching prime and Leave. Not really watching Longer shoes for it. Gotcha me, coops. I'm glad you found a home here in my channel, hanging out with me. I appreciate it very much. Okay.

01:47:50
<transcript>: i'm just going to

01:47:54
lesabotsy: @adamdotdev @thdxr thanks, will look into those. As I said I don't know enough I just want to minimize the chance of making bad choice.

01:47:55
<transcript>: I'm just going to copy this because I feel like dax is getting a little.

01:47:55
<transcript>: i don't know

01:47:58
<transcript>: I don't know. Are you just a little moody? Dax, what's going on.

01:47:58
<transcript>: like what

01:48:08
<transcript>: Like what Chad dbg is spitting out. What chat jippity, spin out. Let's paste. We just got so many functions. Now look at all these functions.

01:48:14
<transcript>: Scrub. Keys. Scrub lasts in scrub specified keys from the last.

01:48:18
<transcript>: In Objects in a list.

01:48:19
thdxr: LEAVE ME ALONE

01:48:21
<transcript>: Okay. So this is a very generic function.

01:48:23
<transcript>: It scrubs the keys.

01:48:23
<transcript>: how does this work

01:48:26
<transcript>: How does this work? Keys to scrub.

01:48:26
<transcript>: reduce

01:48:26
thdxr: jk just exercising my dog

01:48:32
<transcript>: Reduce keys to scrub map function key, and it just puts empty string in them. Well, that's not really.

01:48:32
<transcript>: you don't know

01:48:35
<transcript>: You don't know that the string. I guess this means I can only use it with string.

01:48:39
<transcript>: It's private docker. Okay, whatever.

01:48:40
thdxr: he's been cooped up for this whole week because of the rain and is annoying me so much

01:48:43
<transcript>: Dex. Do you do Doc stuff.

01:48:45
<transcript>: On your private.

01:48:45
<transcript>: stuff

01:48:46
<transcript>: Stuff.

01:48:46
<transcript>: you put doc

01:48:48
<transcript>: You put Doc comments.

01:48:51
<transcript>: Leave me alone.

01:48:51
<transcript>: exerci

01:48:53
<transcript>: Exercise your dog. Okay.

01:49:09
<transcript>: Lessa. Look into those. As I said, I don't know enough. I just want to minimize the chance of making bad choice. Yeah, it's hard. I think at some point you're going to just make mistakes or you're going to go down paths that were less efficient as long as you're learning. It's a journey.

01:49:09
<transcript>: just settle

01:49:10
<transcript>: Just settle in.

01:49:10
<transcript>: it's

01:49:14
<transcript>: It's a really great career. Really great journey to be on.

01:49:14
<transcript>: and don't

01:49:21
<transcript>: And don't be too worried about making mistakes with decisions around tech and that sort of stuff just don't stress too much.

01:49:21
<transcript>: as long as

01:49:25
<transcript>: As long as you're building things, you're going to keep learning.

01:49:25
<transcript>: and

01:49:27
<transcript>: And time is on your side.

01:49:27
<transcript>: okay just

01:49:29
<transcript>: Okay, just set up good habits.

01:49:29
<transcript>: adol

01:49:34
<transcript>: Adolanis at Alanius and shaken bacon.

01:49:34
<transcript>: bake

01:49:40
<transcript>: Bake thank you for those follows. Thank you so much. I appreciate your follows. I really do.

01:49:40
<transcript>: he's been coope

01:49:44
<transcript>: He's been cooped up for this whole week because of the rain annoying me so much.

01:49:45
adolanius: Nice keyboard

01:49:53
adolanius: Is that coffee or water

01:49:58
<transcript>: Ozuko. I had to remember your dog's name for a second. There. It's okay if you don't know my kids names, it's okay, dax. I forgive you because I just forgot the zuko's name. Adelantis, welcome to Chat. Nice keyboard. Is that coffee or water.

01:49:58
<transcript>: this is

01:49:58
lesabotsy: In the end my main goal is still to find a job 👍

01:50:04
<transcript>: This is tea. It's dandelion, which is a dandelion root tea. And then there's.

01:50:07
terawatthour: https://twitter.com/NoContextHumans/status/1646427355005550594?s=20

01:50:09
<transcript>: An English breakfast tea in here. That's got a little caffeine.

01:50:09
<transcript>: that's

01:50:13
<transcript>: That's what it is. I drink dandelion most every morning.

01:50:21
thdxr: I know your kids names

01:50:23
<transcript>: And yes, the keyboard. I love my keyboards. This is a Mode 80 keyboard. It's got a big hair on it, so I'm going to now brush off. Okay.

01:50:23
<transcript>: let's

01:50:28
<transcript>: Let's see in the end, my main goal is still to find a job. Yeah.

01:50:30
<transcript>: So finding a job.

01:50:31
thdxr: Adam 2.1 and Adam 2.2

01:50:37
<transcript>: The thing about finding a job. I don't know if I'm steering you in the right direction. Then I forgot. Lisa.

01:50:37
<transcript>: dax

01:50:43
ocelot2123: react is probably best for finding a job?

01:50:46
<transcript>: Dax, you feel like if someone's trying to find a job, do you walk back and leave your advice? Would you just say, learn, react because most jobs will react? Or is that even the case? Maybe it's not.

01:50:46
<transcript>: adam

01:50:50
<transcript>: Adam 2.1 and M 2.2.

01:50:50
mecoupz: @thdxr i thought it'd be Adam Junior and Adam Junior Junior

01:50:54
<transcript>: Yeah, I would think react might be better for finding a job.

01:50:54
<transcript>: if your goal is just

01:50:56
<transcript>: If your goal is just to get a job.

01:51:01
<transcript>: Maybe nextjs is the way to go. Maybe that's the move.

01:51:01
<transcript>: adam

01:51:04
<transcript>: Adam junior and Adam Jr. Jr.

01:51:04
thdxr: react is the job framework

01:51:09
thdxr: (for losers)

01:51:14
<transcript>: I have no fears around sharing information on the Internet, but I worry that I'm naive. So I see people say, like, don't put your kids pictures or names on the internet.

01:51:14
<transcript>: i always just say

01:51:20
<transcript>: I always just say them like I don't even think about it. Just say their names. Is that bad? Should I not do that.

01:51:20
<transcript>: someone

01:51:25
cedpoilly: Any keyboard recommendations for a newbie to that world? I am a developer & I mostly touch type. Also, I like a full-size keyboard

01:51:28
<transcript>: Someone tell me, am I just being naive? Undefined or private? Wait, is Map index not even a function? Oh, my word.

01:51:28
<transcript>: is it

01:51:28
terawatthour: @thdxr library, react is a library KEKW

01:51:30
cosmiclasagna: I'd say learn React/Next but be sure to understand the patterns so learning other frameworks would be easy

01:51:30
<transcript>: Is it just hallucinate Map index.

01:51:34
teaky: Plenty of PHP jobs boatyVV

01:51:36
<transcript>: Chat jippity.

01:51:38
<transcript>: Are you sure that.

01:51:41
<transcript>: Enum Map index.

01:51:44
<transcript>: I want to give it the arity.

01:51:44
<transcript>: three

01:51:45
<transcript>: Three.

01:51:50
<transcript>: Let's put it in backticks.

01:51:53
<transcript>: Is a real function.

01:51:53
<transcript>: because

01:51:54
<transcript>: Because.

01:51:54
<transcript>: i'm getting

01:51:57
thdxr: there's a seperate index function on Enum I think

01:52:06
mecoupz: tbh my wife and i don't put any information out about our son and soon about our girl. there isnt a single face-image of him out there. if there is a image my wife wants to post on facebook, his face gets covered

01:52:07
<transcript>: I'm getting strong, not real function vibes F four fan Max thank you for the follow. I think that's how you read that. Plenty of php jobs Tiki welcome to my chat.

01:52:07
<transcript>: php

01:52:09
<transcript>: Php is another option.

01:52:12
<transcript>: It's. Php.

01:52:13
tymekdev: @cedpoilly Why would you like a full-size keyboard? Do you really use numpad? I never heard anyone not regretting getting a fullsize, just grab a separate numpad if you need

01:52:15
<transcript>: The Language of lambos.

01:52:15
<transcript>: what's this say

01:52:20
lesabotsy: Finding a job while building my stuff, starting a business online is so easy compared to physical stuff. I'll be trying random stuff and learn at the same time.

01:52:25
<transcript>: What's this say? React is the job framework for losers of dax. You're not a loser, lesa, if you learn React, but it may be the framework to choose.

01:52:25
<transcript>: for

01:52:30
sasankthapa: data structures and algos for a new job as well?

01:52:34
<transcript>: For getting a job any keyboard recommendations for a newbie to that world. I am a developer and I mostly touch type. Oh touch type. Also I like a full size keyboard.

01:52:34
<transcript>: newb

01:52:39
mecoupz: kids will be out there sooner or later and there are too many psyopaths out there so trying to minimize that as much as possible

01:52:40
<transcript>: Newbie to that world. So said twilight. You're talking newbie to mechanical keyboard. World.

01:52:40
<transcript>: because

01:52:41
<transcript>: Because.

01:52:46
<transcript>: I don't think it's not a full size, but I know keycron makes.

01:52:46
<transcript>: like kind of

01:52:48
<transcript>: Like kind of a nice entry level.

01:52:48
<transcript>: you're

01:52:54
<transcript>: You're getting into mechanical keyboards and you want to swap out the switches and maybe tinker with it a bit.

01:52:54
<transcript>: the

01:52:56
<transcript>: The Q. Something.

01:52:56
<transcript>: i

01:53:13
<transcript>: I don't think it's full size, though. If you like a full size, anybody have any recommendations? I use Mode keyboards. I would not call them like newbie keyboards because they're pretty expensive. If you don't want to spend a ton, they might get a little expensive, but they are fantastic keyboards. They're all metal. They're just made so well.

01:53:13
<transcript>: sound

01:53:15
thdxr: @lesabotsy yeah probably should just do NextJS

01:53:20
tymekdev: Yeah, Keychron has a full-size keyboard.

01:53:21
<transcript>: Sound great. The people at Mode are really great. They are a bunch of keyboard nerds. And then they started a company. So it's not just like.

01:53:21
cowfacedev: @TymekDev try keycron. they have everything under the sun.

01:53:22
lesabotsy: @cedpoilly Keychron Q60, I have one it's amazing

01:53:26
<transcript>: I don't know big corporate keyboard company that churns them out.

01:53:26
<transcript>: nomadic thank

01:53:28
<transcript>: Nomadic thank you for the follow.

01:53:29
th3_l3m0n: Keychron do have a full-sized version of every series

01:53:33
<transcript>: Library. React is a library. That's right.

01:53:33
<transcript>: i'd say learn

01:53:41
<transcript>: I'd say learn, react next, but be sure to understand the patterns for learning. Other frameworks would be easy. Yeah. There's a lot of universal stuff in programming.

01:53:41
<transcript>: there's separate inde

01:53:45
xxnickznxx: keyboard needs to function not to sound nice

01:53:45
<transcript>: There's separate index function on enum I think with index.

01:53:45
<transcript>: is this

01:53:49
lesabotsy: @thdxr ok, thanks 👍

01:53:54
adolanius: @Lesabotsy I wish there was a full keyboard though

01:53:55
<transcript>: Is this what I'm supposed to do? Apologies for the confusion. I made a mistake in my response. Great doesn't exist in elixir standalone library. Instead, you can use within X to choose a result.

01:54:03
<transcript>: This is the problem with chat jippity is things are going great until it hallucinates which is all the time.

01:54:03
tymekdev: @Lesabotsy There is one

01:54:06
th3_l3m0n: i am also currently waiting on my Keychron Q3

01:54:06
<transcript>: Okay.

01:54:06
<transcript>: make these

01:54:08
<transcript>: Make these private.

01:54:08
ocelot2123: Q series from keychron is always a safe bet. Pretty good build and comes all pre built

01:54:14
<transcript>: Scrub laps in let's hope this one's actually good.

01:54:17
<transcript>: Let's hope it actually exists.

01:54:20
tymekdev: @cedpoilly I would check out some keyboard creators like Alexotos to see what boards are at the top right now. But you might as well start with Keychron and see if that works for you at all

01:54:24
cowfacedev: I swear by dactyl. won't recommend to beginners though.

01:54:28
<transcript>: Okay. Let's see what the linter says or whatever it's called Drago things for the follow. I appreciate your follow. Drago. To be honest, my wife and I don't put any information about.

01:54:28
<transcript>: our son

01:54:38
drago18121996: thanks :D

01:54:39
tymekdev: @Lesabotsy Keychron Q6

01:54:42
<transcript>: Our son. And soon about our girl. There isn't a single face image of him out there. If there is an image my wife wants to post on Facebook, his face gets covered. Yeah, I've seen that. And I think Mccoups, there must be something that, you know, that I just am naive and haven't understood.

01:54:42
<transcript>: and

01:54:47
<transcript>: And I don't want to do something that is harmful to my kids in any way.

01:54:47
<transcript>: so i think

01:55:00
<transcript>: So I think I need to read up on it or something. Why would you like a full sized keyboard do you really use? Nope. Finding a job while building my stuff starting a business online is so easy compared to physical stuff. I'll be trying random stuff and learn at the same time.

01:55:00
<transcript>: yeah

01:55:04
<transcript>: Yeah. I think if you were trying to build something for yourself.

01:55:13
<transcript>: And what you described, like building Spa like applications. Then I really do think Solid js has a really bright future. I think Ryan Carneado knows more about.

01:55:13
<transcript>: the whole

01:55:17
<transcript>: The whole space than anyone will ever forget.

01:55:21
terawatthour: buy das keyboard, problem solved

01:55:24
<transcript>: Wait. He's forgotten. No. He's forgotten more about the front end space than anyone will ever know.

01:55:24
<transcript>: i trust

01:55:30
cedpoilly: Okay maybe not the numpad but the full layout otherwise. I use the F keys much, the arrows, the home/end, printscreen etc

01:55:33
<transcript>: I trust him inherently. And also, dax is very smart. And if dax thinks solid is best, I think it has a really good future. But the future.

01:55:33
<transcript>: can sometimes

01:55:44
<transcript>: Can sometimes be a ways off and in the job market today, probably a lot less solid jobs. So solid js jobs not solid like good jobs. You know what I'm saying.

01:55:47
<transcript>: Data structures and outgoes for a new job as well. So.

01:55:51
ocelot2123: wait what you use a touchpad?

01:55:59
cedpoilly: Thanks all for the suggestions ✌️

01:55:59
<transcript>: Sasson, I guess. Probably for new. Yeah, for going through the interview process. You're probably going to need to have a grasp on data structures and algorithms. I took the side door, as dax calls it in my career.

01:55:59
<transcript>: and

01:56:02
<transcript>: And I've just worked for myself or.

01:56:02
<transcript>: i've

01:56:04
<transcript>: I've started my own startup.

01:56:04
<transcript>: that's basically

01:56:09
<transcript>: That's basically my whole career has been working for myself, working for my own startup.

01:56:09
<transcript>: and in that

01:56:16
<transcript>: And in that scenario, I didn't have to know a lot of foundational stuff. I was able to kind of fake it and just build stuff.

01:56:16
<transcript>: but

01:56:20
<transcript>: But I know a lot of traditional employers.

01:56:20
<transcript>: the lead code

01:56:22
tymekdev: @cedpoilly Yup! Then 80% (aka TKL) or 75% depend on which aesthetics work for you more. Mode Sonnet would be an example of one

01:56:23
<transcript>: The lead code stuff and there are reasons.

01:56:23
<transcript>: that

01:56:34
<transcript>: That they may want more of that out of you and it's just a good foundation. Honestly, I went back and took prime's dsa course on Friendly Masters, which is free, by the way, you should take it.

01:56:34
papasmurfofdeath: I’ve only used react in a handful of production codebases  as part of teams and it always seems messy

01:56:41
<transcript>: I took it because I realized there's a lot of foundational stuff. I just don't know. I don't know how to do a quick sort algorithm off the back of.

01:56:43
<transcript>: My whatever.

01:56:43
<transcript>: brain

01:56:47
<transcript>: Brain. Top of my head. What is it? Top of my head? Yeah.

01:56:47
<transcript>: i

01:56:55
caasidev: where is that course?

01:56:56
<transcript>: I don't know how to do that stuff. So I took the course. It was amazing. Prime is just really good at that. At teaching. It was fun to see a different side of Prime.

01:56:56
<transcript>: like a little

01:56:57
<transcript>: Like a little.

01:56:59
<transcript>: Restrained.

01:57:02
<transcript>: From how he can normally speak.

01:57:02
<transcript>: it was pretty

01:57:03
thdxr: I never intentionally learned those things but naturally learned them through work

01:57:03
<transcript>: It was pretty fun.

01:57:03
<transcript>: i recommend

01:57:13
mecoupz: @caasidev i think its on frontend masters

01:57:16
tymekdev: @caasidev https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/

01:57:18
lilfreezi: FEM tamed the beast that is prime on twitch

01:57:23
<transcript>: I recommend it. And I felt like I learned so much foundational stuff that I just wish I had known already. So yeah, data structures now goes for a new job. Probably helps. Also just feels good and is good. So there you go. Kids will be out there sooner or later, and there are too many psychopaths out there. So trying to minimize that as much as possible. That makes sense because it really does.

01:57:23
<transcript>: okay

01:57:26
<transcript>: Okay. Keycron has a full size keyboard. Oh, there you go.

01:57:30
<transcript>: Sepa. You're welcome for all the suggestions.

01:57:45
sasankthapa: SeemsGood

01:57:45
<transcript>: Das keyboard. I've not heard of that. Or maybe I have drago. Welcome to chat, welcome to chat, welcome to chat, chat, chat, cowface. I swear my Dactyl won't recommend to beginners, though. Dactyl, I've heard you talk about this. Dactyl.

01:57:47
glamshatterskull: das has been around a long time

01:57:48
kryotoboi: But the full size keychron in not wireless

01:57:53
glamshatterskull: i used to have one

01:57:58
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Papa smurf. I've only used React in a handful of production code bases as part of Teams, and it always seems messy. Yeah. Dax talks about that a lot like React. Code bases do not age well.

01:57:59
lilfreezi: @cedpoilly keychron k2 is what i got last june. i thought i would miss the num pad a lot more than i actually do

01:58:04
<transcript>: Where is that? Course. Can someone link? Does anyone have? There it is. Someone linked. It timex. Got you.

01:58:05
terawatthour: well remembering algos is completely different from understanding the concept

01:58:21
<transcript>: I never intentionally learned those things, but naturally learn them through work. Yeah, maybe dax. I just didn't learn them through work as much. I don't know if the type of work I was doing. I probably learned some of it. I mean, like, the basic stuff, but I definitely didn't learn about sorting algorithms.

01:58:23
<transcript>: And lots of that stuff.

01:58:27
<transcript>: Fem tamed the Beast that is prime on twitch. Yeah.

01:58:27
<transcript>: i love

01:58:28
caasidev: cheers @mecoupz, @TymekDev

01:58:39
thdxr: I built a database at one point so learned a lot of data structure / dist systems things

01:58:40
<transcript>: I love his course. I mean, he's got another one that I think he has another one on front of Masters. Now I loved seeing the contrast of prime in that setting. It's just like it's funny because he still makes some jokes and.

01:58:42
<transcript>: It's like a little more.

01:58:47
<transcript>: Like pg. But you know what he really wants to say.

01:58:47
<transcript>: it's just

01:58:59
thdxr: in elixir actually!

01:59:07
<transcript>: It's just fun. Glam is here. Nasa's been around a long time. It does sound kind of familiar. Is that German dos keyboard. The full size key chron is not wireless. Used to have one remembering algo's is completely different from understanding the concept that's true terawatt built a database at one point. So I learned a lot of data structures. Am I leaking.

01:59:11
<transcript>: Why is there something wet? Why is that wet.

01:59:17
<transcript>: Learned a lot of data structure, disk system things okay.

01:59:24
<transcript>: In elixir. Even does this code work? I'm just not using it, right.

01:59:24
<transcript>: scrub

01:59:25
<transcript>: Scrub, keys.

01:59:29
devagrawal09: wasupp

01:59:30
<transcript>: That's concerning because it is used right there. Why does it say it's not used.

01:59:33
terawatthour: "why is this wet?" adam u so humble

01:59:34
<transcript>: Keys is used. It's right there.

01:59:37
<transcript>: Like right there. Right.

01:59:41
<transcript>: No. Is it spelled wrong? Scrub, keys.

01:59:44
<transcript>: It's two things get passed in.

01:59:44
mecoupz: dax has too much free time for building a database

01:59:50
<transcript>: What's going on? Oh, it's not used because scrub last scene is not used. I got you.

01:59:52
<transcript>: So down here.

01:59:52
<transcript>: i think column

01:59:56
<transcript>: I think column so we want to scrub last in.

02:00:00
<transcript>: Let's see up here. We're going to scrub.

02:00:00
<transcript>: the

02:00:02
<transcript>: The last in categories.

02:00:02
<transcript>: okay

02:00:04
<transcript>: Okay. Enum.

02:00:06
thdxr: I built my own database for my startup - terrible technical decision making

02:00:06
<transcript>: Take. No, we're not doing that.

devagrawal09: first time catching this stream without pulling an all nighter

02:00:10
<transcript>: We're doing.

02:00:14
<transcript>: Scrub last in we're going to pass in the list.

02:00:20
<transcript>: Which is that and we're going to pass in the keys.

02:00:23
<transcript>: Is it keys first or categories first.

02:00:27
<transcript>: Account first and then the keys.

02:00:32
<transcript>: Like this and then keys will be.

02:00:32
thdxr: it was an insanely productive setup though, kinda looked like supabase

02:00:35
<transcript>: I don't know.

02:00:40
<transcript>: I don't know. Categories, name lines. It's an array.

02:00:40
<transcript>: it

02:00:42
<transcript>: It's an array. It's an array.

02:00:50
<transcript>: So if I want to scrub namelines, I need to set it to an empty array. So I need to update the code to work name.

02:00:52
<transcript>: Lines.

02:00:57
<transcript>: Here. I need to say if it's a string.

02:00:57
<transcript>: scrub

02:00:59
<transcript>: Scrub keys. Let's see.

02:01:02
<transcript>: Oh, no. Right here.

02:01:02
<transcript>: put

02:01:06
<transcript>: Put map output accumulator key.

02:01:06
<transcript>: i need to know

02:01:08
<transcript>: I need to know if the value.

02:01:11
<transcript>: Okay, let's see.

02:01:14
<transcript>: Chat, gyppity.

02:01:16
<transcript>: Let's say.

02:01:18
<transcript>: I need to update.

02:01:18
<transcript>: the

02:01:20
<transcript>: The scrub.

02:01:22
<transcript>: Keys.

02:01:24
<transcript>: Function.

02:01:24
<transcript>: to handle

02:01:26
<transcript>: To handle.

02:01:30
<transcript>: Keys that have a list value as well.

02:01:30
devagrawal09: why is everyone calling is ChatGippity

02:01:34
<transcript>: Setting them to an empty list.

02:01:40
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:01:51
glamshatterskull: @devagrawal09 prolly cause prime said it

02:01:55
<transcript>: Why is everyone calling? Why is everyone calling it chat Jippity? I think I saw it on prime's stream. Dev first time catching the stream without pulling an allnighter. Hey, nice. You woke up Dev and you caught me in the morning.

02:01:55
<transcript>: is an insanely

02:01:55
devagrawal09: lmao

02:01:58
uberrick: @devagrawal09 easy to say but from Prime

02:02:01
<transcript>: Is an insanely productive setup, though. Kind of looked like superbase. Interesting. Dax. You built superbase and elixir.

02:02:05
<transcript>: You've had quite a pass. Dax.

02:02:05
<transcript>: probably

02:02:06
uberrick: easier*

02:02:11
uberrick: Hey Adam

02:02:14
<transcript>: Probably because prime said it. Yeah, that's why I call it chat jippity. Easy to say it is much easier than saying gpt. I will say that.

02:02:14
<transcript>: mugen

02:02:17
<transcript>: Mugen. Thank you for the follow. Mugen.

02:02:19
<transcript>: Rick is here.

02:02:19
<transcript>: how

02:02:23
<transcript>: How are you doing? Rick? How's Rick.

02:02:31
<transcript>: Send me your Tweets, everybody.

02:02:31
<transcript>: if you

02:02:32
glamshatterskull: it's the same syllables

02:02:34
glamshatterskull: LUL

02:02:35
<transcript>: If you have tweets you want me to read, I'm going to do Twitter time here pretty soon.

02:02:37
devagrawal09: next time prime farts on stream it becomes a trend

02:02:38
kryotoboi: Yesterday I slept listening to a twitter space where dax was there.

02:02:40
<transcript>: The same syllables. But there's something about saying GPT.

02:02:40
<transcript>: that's so hard

02:02:43
uberrick: I'm good, you seen much improvement with the gpt-4 model?

02:02:52
<transcript>: That's so hard it's because they all sound the same gpet. They all rhyme. Maybe that's it gpt. It's hard for my mouth to do it. Chat, gpt, chat, jippity jippity just rolls right off the tongue.

02:03:02
<transcript>: Yesterday, I slept listening to a Twitter space. Where dax was there. Dax, what Twitter station did you join.

02:03:10
devagrawal09: oh was that code and life

02:03:21
<transcript>: Seen much improvement with the gbd Four model. Yeah, no, it's a lot better. It really is. We use a Casey fridge to check the value type of the current key. As the value is a binary, we set it to nift string as the value of the list we set to an empty list. The value type doesn't match you the case. We leave the map unchanged. Oh, nice updated version of scrubber module will now handle keys with the list value.

02:03:21
<transcript>: values setting them

02:03:25
<transcript>: Values, setting them to an empty list. Okay. Did anything up here? Change.

02:03:31
<transcript>: I don't think it changed. That part is the same. No, yes, no.

02:03:34
<transcript>: It changed. Wait, what.

02:03:34
<transcript>: did

02:03:36
<transcript>: Did it change.

02:03:44
<transcript>: Link. Bliss. Enum. No, it's the same. Okay, so this just changed. Cool.

02:03:49
<transcript>: No. What did I do.

02:04:01
<transcript>: Scrub keys. Let's see. Empty list. Okay, that should work then. So scrub lasts. In is not unused anymore. It's used right here.

02:04:01
kryotoboi: Might be.. million.js was being discussed among other things

02:04:04
<transcript>: Let's grab name lines from the last.

02:04:14
<transcript>: In okay. And it shows that it's used. Now let's see if it works. Moment of truth. We've worked so hard for this moment. I.

02:04:14
<transcript>: guess the

02:04:15
<transcript>: Guess the box.

02:04:15
<transcript>: should just

02:04:18
<transcript>: Should just scrub the names down here.

02:04:27
<transcript>: Should erase the names from the last. However many the first five will be visible and the last should not be. If it worked, it did not work.

02:04:35
<transcript>: It did not work. Okay. What do we do? Wrong? Scrub last in Chad Jippity. What did you do.

02:04:49
<transcript>: Code in life. Dax, did you join Code in Life last night? I like joining code in life. A lot of nights. I join it while I'm cleaning the kitchen. Might be million. Js was being discussed, among other things. What were you guys discussing? Dax, tell me about the space.

02:04:49
<transcript>: ignore

02:04:52
<transcript>: Ignore your dog. Your dog is fine.

02:05:00
<transcript>: Your dog is fine.

02:05:00
<transcript>: send

02:05:02
thdxr: lol

02:05:04
<transcript>: Send me tweets people tweets just paste if you just tweet I'm sorry just.

02:05:04
<transcript>: paste

02:05:06
thdxr: I wasn't in it long

02:05:18
<transcript>: Paste Twitter links into my chat and they will show up on my screen when I do Twitter time here in a minute. You weren't in it long. What was it about? What did they talk about on Code in Life last night? Tell me things.

02:05:18
<transcript>: i like to demand

02:05:19
thdxr: same boring irrelevant frontend discussion

02:05:23
<transcript>: I like to demand things of dax. It's really mean of me. But you know what, dax? You do a lot of things to me.

02:05:23
<transcript>: you call me

02:05:25
<transcript>: You call me a scammer.

02:05:35
terawatthour: that code was deprecated before it even went into codebase

02:05:38
<transcript>: I don't know. You probably do other things that I'm not aware of. So if I ask a little attention, I ask of your attention a little bit on stream. You know what? It's all even call it even. Okay, same boring, irrelevant friend in discussion.

02:05:38
<transcript>: that code

02:05:38
thdxr: then tried joining another one later and it was boring discussions about diversity where no one had any insight

02:05:43
<transcript>: That code was deprecated before it even went into code base. Terawat.

02:05:47
thdxr: I'm going to host a space

02:05:50
<transcript>: This code's bad enum reduce keys to scrub.

02:05:50
<transcript>: ma

02:05:53
<transcript>: Map? What is? Wait, what.

02:05:56
<transcript>: How does that work.

02:06:04
<transcript>: Invoke function for each so for each key.

02:06:10
<transcript>: Reduce I don't know how this code works, so I cannot possibly.

02:06:20
<transcript>: Make sense of it. Map. Get accumulator. So the object is the accumulator. That's the map. Okay, that makes sense.

02:06:23
devagrawal09: @thdxr do it

02:06:25
<transcript>: Right element. Okay, so T.

02:06:29
terawatthour: "i dont know how this works" great words said by a great man

02:06:32
<transcript>: I need to understand how this works. Reduce T and then element.

02:06:32
<transcript>: and then the

02:06:34
<transcript>: And then the function.

02:06:34
<transcript>: and it

02:06:35
<transcript>: And it returns.

02:06:35
<transcript>: the

02:06:36
devagrawal09: i can cohost

02:06:37
<transcript>: The accumulator.

02:06:44
greatgrievance: it reduces a map into the same map, except binary values are replace with empty strings and arrays are replaced with empty arrays

02:06:47
thdxr: @devagrawal09 what's the format of this thing on Friday

02:06:49
<transcript>: Let's see. This is the first element of the enumerable is used. Is the initial value of the accumulator function will only be executed n minus one times. Okay. I think I understand it. So we reduce we go through every key.

02:06:57
<transcript>: And we get the value if the value is a binary, so it's a string.

02:06:57
<transcript>: we put

02:06:58
<transcript>: We put.

02:06:58
<transcript>: map

02:07:00
devagrawal09: did you happen to receive a giant email

02:07:04
<transcript>: Map. Put. Wait. Is map to put a thing. I can just do that. I thought I couldn't do that.

02:07:12
<transcript>: Map put accumulator key, and then the value is empty. String. When it's a list, we put an empty list.

02:07:13
<transcript>: okay

02:07:14
<transcript>: Okay.

02:07:16
cedpoilly: This reduce is similar to the on un JS

02:07:19
<transcript>: Should I do the Is list check first.

02:07:25
cedpoilly: *one in JS

02:07:30
<transcript>: Had gpt know what it's doing here? We have list minimum with index in a map item and index if index is greater than length minus.

02:07:30
<transcript>: n

02:07:32
<transcript>: N.

02:07:38
<transcript>: Yes. Scrub keys. Else. Just return the item.

02:07:38
<transcript>: that all sounds right

02:07:39
<transcript>: That all? Sounds right.

02:07:39
<transcript>: i don't know

02:07:43
thdxr: uhhh idts

02:07:45
thdxr: let me see

02:07:47
<transcript>: I don't know. Let's save everything. Let's just make sure so categories scrub last in we pass in the categories.

02:07:47
<transcript>: and

02:07:54
<transcript>: And we pass in count and name lines. Did I get that right? Is it namelines.

02:07:59
<transcript>: Yeah, name Lines is the key.

02:08:04
<transcript>: It's an array of strings. We want to wipe that out.

02:08:07
<transcript>: Maybe I should refresh. Maybe.

02:08:12
<transcript>: It's just against theebols. Maybe it's just like stale.

02:08:20
<transcript>: This reduces somewhat to the one in js. Did you happen to see a giant email me.

02:08:26
thdxr: yeah didn't get it

02:08:31
<transcript>: You tominate me dev? Oh, I missed some chat, then tried joining another one later. And it was boring discussion about diversity, where no one had any insight.

02:08:38
<transcript>: Dax, do it. Host the space. I don't know how this works. Great word said by a great man. Thanks, Tara.

02:08:38
<transcript>: deb's going to

02:08:45
greatgrievance: JS Array.prototype.reduce doesn't work on objects/maps, but you can always convert those to tuples first

02:08:47
glamshatterskull: man i can't believe the bulls came back on the raptors last night

02:08:53
glamshatterskull: but hopefully nick nurse goes to houston

02:08:54
<transcript>: Deb's going to co host it reduces the map into the same map, except binary values are replaced with empty strings and errands replace them strings. Great grievance. Does that check out that code looks right. What's the format of this thing on Friday? What's on Friday? Did you happen to receive a giant email.

02:08:54
<transcript>: introduce is

02:08:57
<transcript>: Introduce is similar to the one JS.

02:09:05
<transcript>: Reduced doesn't work on objects, math, but you can always okay can't believe the Bulls came back on the Raptors last night, but hopefully Nick Nurse goes to Houston.

02:09:05
<transcript>: nick

02:09:12
<transcript>: Nick Nurse, coach of The Raptors. I knew that I didn't know the playoffs started. Has it begun.

02:09:12
<transcript>: are we

02:09:16
<transcript>: Are we into the playoffs? The throws of playoffs basketball.

02:09:18
glamshatterskull: it's the playins right now

02:09:20
glamshatterskull: yeah

02:09:23
<transcript>: Oh, this is talking about it. No. On January 2. Never mind.

02:09:23
<transcript>: so

02:09:24
cosmiclasagna: just the play in

02:09:30
<transcript>: So why is this not working? Why is update in category scrub last in not working.

02:09:33
<transcript>: We're trying to take the last.

02:09:34
cosmiclasagna: this weekend's the actual playoffs

02:09:36
devagrawal09: @thdxr might be sending that out today

02:09:38
<transcript>: How Many Categories count.

02:09:38
<transcript>: what are we

02:09:40
<transcript>: What are we passing into? Count, actually.

02:09:43
<transcript>: I don't even know. I think it's five.

02:09:43
<transcript>: this should just

02:09:46
<transcript>: This should just be the first five.

02:09:50
<transcript>: Oh, the last five in. Oh, it could be working.

02:09:50
<transcript>: this

02:09:57
<transcript>: This is not what I want. I did the logic wrong. I want it to be. Take the first five count.

02:10:00
<transcript>: Okay. So instead of count.

02:10:00
<transcript>: let's see

02:10:02
<transcript>: Let's see, how do I want to do this.

02:10:02
<transcript>: we're going to do

02:10:04
<transcript>: We're going to do some math.

02:10:04
<transcript>: links and

02:10:07
<transcript>: Links. And then we want to do count is actually.

02:10:11
<transcript>: Count is.

02:10:15
<transcript>: Length minus n.

02:10:18
<transcript>: Oh, I just need to reverse.

02:10:21
<transcript>: X is greater than.

02:10:21
<transcript>: length min

02:10:23
<transcript>: Length minus n.

02:10:26
<transcript>: Scrub keys. Oh, no, this is right.

02:10:28
<transcript>: This is right.

02:10:38
<transcript>: Right. Okay, if index is greater than the length of the list, which is 25 minus five, so greater than 20. No, that's not right.

02:10:38
<transcript>: it's not right

02:10:39
<transcript>: It's not right.

02:10:42
<transcript>: If it's greater than the count.

02:10:42
<transcript>: so if

02:10:46
<transcript>: So if it's greater than if nx is greater than.

02:10:48
<transcript>: In.

02:10:49
greatgrievance: you just want n

02:10:52
<transcript>: Like that.

02:10:55
<transcript>: Right? Yeah. Scrub lasts in.

02:10:57
thdxr: I really need to start working on my react miami talk

02:11:00
<transcript>: Yes.

02:11:00
<transcript>: it's named po

02:11:02
<transcript>: It's named poorly now, but that's what I want.

02:11:05
<transcript>: When we're not even using this.

02:11:09
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:11:13
<transcript>: I think this what I want is just name poorly now Raptors.

02:11:25
devagrawal09: nah you'll be fine just improv it

02:11:26
<transcript>: You just want in. Exactly. Thank you. Great. Grievance. This weekend's. The actual playoffs. Oh, just the play in. That's right. They have a play in now. It works. It works.

02:24:20
<transcript>: When you win like I did, you don't get it anyway. Oh, my goodness. You guys, in all the rumors, there are people who aren't going to do this. Is that your strategy? You're trying to get less competition for the macbook because there are people who aren't going to do it because you guys are convincing them. It's a scam. It's not a scam. It's real.

02:24:20
<transcript>: we can be

02:25:14
dnbull: :D

02:25:15
devagrawal09: no i meant i thought there was an automated response when someone claimed the chance

02:25:20
mecoupz: probably hardcoded to "adamdotdev"

02:25:21
<transcript>: Do you really think that this man would be capable of programming a real randomizer? Okay, so it's pseudo random, but it's random enough, right? Dmbles. Here.

02:25:41
<transcript>: No, I meant I thought there was an automated response when someone claimed the chance. Oh, no, dev. I turned off the telling you you didn't win. It was getting overwhelming in chat. Now it only tells you if you win, so we won't see any messages until someone wins. Probably hard coded to Adam. Dev, it's not watch. Let me prove it. How funny would it be if I actually won right now? How funny would it be.

02:25:41
<transcript>: where's

02:25:42

02:28:31
<transcript>: If you're convincing though you'll tell me a thing that I'll believe it's just not true.

02:28:31
<transcript>: it won't even

02:28:33
<transcript>: It won't even work.

02:28:33
<transcript>: dev just

02:28:35
<transcript>: Dev just won a macbook? Oh.

02:28:35
<transcript>: ohmg

02:28:38
thdxr: try it

02:28:40
thdxr: you'll see

02:28:40
<transcript>: Ohmg, oh, there's an actual bug. There's not an actual bug.

02:28:43
<transcript>: Tell me what the bug is.

02:28:47
laytanl_: It returns 0 to 100 right?

02:28:52
nft_scam: open source it, let me fix it

02:28:55
<transcript>: This is bugged lol. Look at it. It's from your account. Name. Matt Random. Oh, that was a good one. Me. Coops will never be less than zero one. Sure it will.

02:28:57
whatizit: did you write a test for this

02:28:57
janecki1820: where is the unit test? :D :D :D

02:29:03
<transcript>: It's not a bug. Does Random even have a resolution like that? Yes, it does. We tested it people. It's real.

02:29:04
thdxr: Math.random doesn't return numbers less than < 0.01

02:29:07
<transcript>: I want my points back. You guys are funny.

02:29:09
fragaverage: its * 100 though

02:29:09
terawatthour: @laytanl_ non inclusive range probably

02:29:10
thdxr: you need to multiply it

02:29:15
<transcript>: It's not a scam. Raymond hypothesis is a $1 million prize problem. Ooh, let's solve it.

02:29:17
<transcript>: Let's do it, let's do it.

02:29:17
<transcript>: matt

02:29:25
dnbull: uh oh all the maf nerds about to fight here

02:29:29
<transcript>: Matt ramon will never return less than zero. One. Try it. You'll see it returns zero to 100, right? No. I'll show you open source it. Let me fix it. Did you write a test for this? I don't write test.

02:29:29
<transcript>: math

02:29:32
<transcript>: Math. Ram doesn't return numbers.

02:29:32
<transcript>: less than

02:29:34
<transcript>: Less than zero one.

02:29:34
<transcript>: is

02:29:36
fragaverage: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random

02:29:41
<transcript>: Is 100, though non inclusive. I'm multiplying it by 100. Yes.

02:29:41
<transcript>: you need

02:29:44
glamshatterskull: chatgpt is excellent for writing tests

02:29:49
<transcript>: You need to multiply it all the math nerds about to fight. Here, let me show you. Let's test the code. How can I show you this.

02:29:55
thdxr: yeah but when you multiple < 0.1 by 100 you get 0

02:29:55
<transcript>: Thank you so much. Moncef for the one month Tier One sub.

02:29:57
fragaverage: Math.random() returns 0-1, you're multiplying by 100, so 0-100

02:29:59
<transcript>: Math random returns a number.

02:30:08
monsef_ot: Hello

02:30:08
terawatthour: run in 4*10^9 times and check how many

02:30:09
<transcript>: Watch. How can I test this JavaScript? Let's just do like a Javascript playground. Javascript playground.

02:30:14
thdxr: I can't believe this was a scam the whole time

02:30:14
<transcript>: Watch this. Jsl. I've heard of that.

02:30:15
whatizit: write a bruteforcer

02:30:16
tymekdev: 0-100 still includes things falling under <=0.01

02:30:16
<transcript>: Okay.

02:30:24
<transcript>: Const. Can I do const? I don't know. Const. Entry equals math. Random.

02:30:24
<transcript>: times

02:30:26
<transcript>: Times 100.

02:30:26
noctate12: I knew i should win

02:30:27
mejingjard: How is he doing a different project every stream? Haha

02:30:27
mecoupz: returns a number between 0 and 1 and you're multiplying it by 100, so it can never be 0.01 after multiplying

02:30:27
<transcript>: Okay.

02:30:31
<transcript>: Console, log.

02:30:36
<transcript>: Can't believe I'm wasting time on this. You guys.

02:30:37
whatizit: ^

02:30:39
<transcript>: This is what you wanted. Just to watch me.

02:30:39
<transcript>: worry

02:30:43
terawatthour: @TymekDev yes but probability is negligible

02:30:43
<transcript>: Worry about this 20.66.

02:30:46
<transcript>: Okay.

02:30:46
<transcript>: so

02:30:48
<transcript>: So let's run it several times.

02:30:48
thdxr: you're going to be so embarassed

02:30:53
thdxr: this is 100% a bug

02:30:56
laytanl_: Just put it at <= 1 to be sure ;)

02:31:00
andreaslorozco: :O

02:31:00
terawatthour: run in 4*10^9 times and check how many

02:31:04
<transcript>: What's the smallest. This could be because it could be zero. That's all point. It's a small chance. There was three. It could be zero. Point. Something. Something. And that's the whole point.

02:31:04
<transcript>: i could

02:31:08
<transcript>: I could if you just want Wait, just put it at less than one to be sure.

02:31:08
<transcript>: you're going to be so embarrassed it's

02:31:11
thdxr: run it in a loop

02:31:13
thdxr: until it matches

02:31:14
thdxr: then break

02:31:17
<transcript>: You're going to be so embarrassed. It's not a bug. Wait, let me read here. How is he doing a different project? Every stream zero to 100 still includes things falling under? Yeah.

02:31:17
oetziofficial: ^

02:31:19
<transcript>: Guys.

02:31:19
<transcript>: it's not a

02:31:20
<transcript>: It's not a bug.

02:31:20
<transcript>: when

02:31:22
thdxr: after 10,000 it should break

02:31:24
noctate12: Infinite loop Kappa

02:31:25
<transcript>: When you multiply less than 0.1 by 100, you get zero. No.

02:31:25
<transcript>: now

02:31:28
thdxr: it's a bug adam

02:31:28
<transcript>: Now you're just trying to hedge. It's not a rounding area.

02:31:30
thdxr: just listen

02:31:32
devagrawal09: is there a flood storm in miami?

02:31:33
<transcript>: This one is 3.23. It could have just as easily been zero point 23.

02:31:33
<transcript>: and then

02:31:38
<transcript>: And then it wouldn't have been less. But you see what I'm saying? It can be zero point.

02:31:40
<transcript>: Something. Something. Something.

02:31:47
<transcript>: And it's not, but it could be. And I don't know how to make this random code. Generate a zero.

02:31:47
mecoupz: loop it

02:31:50
<transcript>: I can't, because it's random.

02:31:50
dnbull: the storm is over but yeah we are swimming over here LUL

02:31:54
thdxr: run a simulation and you'll see

02:31:55
<transcript>: Listen, it's not a bug. You guys.

02:31:58
<transcript>: It's not a bug.

02:31:58
<transcript>: how can

02:31:58
whatizit: loop it and catch the lowest value

02:31:59
fragaverage: generate 100 values without the * 100 plz

02:32:01
codingbrah: do a loop

02:32:02
<transcript>: How can I write a test that would prove it's not a bike. There was a one.

02:32:04
devagrawal09: my fking airbnb cancelled

02:32:05
thdxr: 100% it's abug

02:32:08

02:32:10
whatizit: this is bugged!

02:32:18
codingrob: exactly @TymekDev :D

02:32:19
whatizit: test!

02:32:20
janecki1820: @TymekDev this

02:32:22
<transcript>: If you guys would be happy, I could do not multiply by 100 and I could just do.

02:32:25
thdxr: it'll never be under 0

02:32:26
terawatthour: the chance is literally non existent

02:32:26
fragaverage: @TymekDev this this this

02:32:29
<transcript>: Zero, zero one or whatever. If you want that, we could do that. But it's the same thing.

02:32:30
laytanl_: let j = 0; while(true) {j+=1; if ((Math.random() * 100) <= 0.01) { console.log(j); break; }}

dongillius: its quite easy to hit 0.01 actually..

02:32:48
<transcript>: Run in four times, ten to the nine times. And check how many. Oh, I could run. It a ton. That's true. When you multiply less than zero, one by 100, you get zero. That's not true. I can't believe this is scandal time. Oh, my goodness. You guys ride a brute forcer. I knew I should win.

02:32:50
sj_se: run that and it prints out tons of results

02:32:50
devagrawal09: @dnbull they were

02:32:53
<transcript>: It can be 0.1, it really can.

02:33:03
pbertrand_dev: I just did a test and it hit after 60k

02:33:05
<transcript>: Quite easy to hit 0.0 welcome to Chat dong Ellis. Welcome, welcome, do the simulation. Oh, while loop. Okay, let's just do this. Let's do this.

iannery: wrong condition

02:33:38

devagrawal09: you need to put it in a variable so you can log it

02:33:43
thdxr: ADAM

02:33:46

02:33:46
thdxr: CONDITION IS BACKWARDS

02:33:46
laytanl_: more then equal

02:33:47
xqcli: that wont work

02:33:49
<transcript>: You need to put into variable so you can log it can.

02:33:49
<transcript>: backwards

02:33:49
yozd82: no does not work

02:33:52
<transcript>: Backwards. Well, I'm just logging.

02:33:52
thdxr: you're so good at writing bugs

02:33:57

02:33:57
<transcript>: that won't work

02:34:01

02:34:13
<transcript>: you just

02:34:13
thdxr: condition is backwards

02:34:18
<transcript>: is it

02:34:21
tymekdev: you want to go until you don't hit <=0.01, so condition should be > 0.0.1

02:34:24
codingrob: it should check it is greater than..

02:34:26
mecoupz: take the code from @TymekDev

02:34:27

02:36:21
mecoupz: dax did you clipped that?

02:36:21
<transcript>: I don't hate you, but I do kind of hate you. Because that was ten minutes of my life. Ten minutes. I feel good, though. It wasn't a waste, because I proved something. I proved that this is not a scam. Dax has been lying. Dax is a scammer. He's the one that's been scamming you all. He's been scamming out of a chance at a free macbook. Look at this. People are actually redeeming it now.

02:36:23
coolpantstv: Why is this macbook giveaway app written in elixir with millions of users?

02:36:26
thdxr: it's still a scam because this isn't the code that's running

02:36:27
kevinnaughtonjr: hi adam hi chat!

02:36:28
<transcript>: There isn't a bug. I knew you were trolling me. I don't know why I put up with this. If I don't win, it's rigged.

02:36:28
<transcript>: that's right

02:36:30
<transcript>: That's right. Dagley.

02:36:30
<transcript>: while you're here

02:36:32
<transcript>: While you're here up the percentage.

02:36:40
fragaverage: 5million points before a win, not including the math.random not being random. That's rough

02:36:40
<transcript>: Why is this magnus giveaway approit written in elixir with millions of users? Cool Pants. This is not the elixir app.

02:36:42
<transcript>: I was being.

02:36:42
<transcript>: trolled

02:36:43
gitpush_gitpaid: wait just came in. what did i miss

02:36:44
ocelot2123: up the percentage when its my draw

02:36:48
<transcript>: Trolled and it robbed you all of working on the actual elixir app that we should be working on right now.

02:36:51
noctate12: Itd be cool if u would know how close you were

02:36:52
<transcript>: But here we go.

02:36:57
laytanl_: Add `if (dax) { return; }`

02:36:57
<transcript>: It's still a scam, because this isn't the code that's running. Oh, my goodness, stop it.

02:36:57
devagrawal09: oooh nice pipes you got there

02:37:00
tardidriss: 100/0.01= 100x100=10000

02:37:02
thdxr: dw guys I put some code in the rebase codebase so the next time he runs it it changes the probability

02:37:03
<transcript>: You guys, the trolling. It'd be cool if you would know how close you were.

02:37:08
<transcript>: There's no way to know how close you are, right? It's just a one in 10,000 chance every time.

02:37:11
coolpantstv: Oh, is the elixir app as buggy as the giveaway one?

02:37:23
<transcript>: Git push just came in. What did I miss? You missed me being trolled. Kevin's. Here. What's going on? Kevin? I like Kevin. Kevin doesn't troll me. Okay. What did we get done? We got something done. I scrubbed these.

02:37:28
<transcript>: We scrubbed those now, and I scrubbed the colors. Oh, I need to not scrub the color.

02:37:28
oetziofficial: (but doesnt javascript save the state of the random, since its not really random) ? hence evertime you restart the stream/code the state is being reset. Not sure tho

02:37:30
<transcript>: From all of them though.

02:37:30
<transcript>: this work right

02:37:32
kubahasek: i come here for today and Adam is getting trolled

02:37:35
<transcript>: This work right here. Update column. We're removing label.

02:37:37
<transcript>: I want to do that. Maybe I don't.

02:37:38
thdxr: @gitpush_gitpaid we made adam waste 10 min by convincing him he had a bug when he didn't

02:37:43
<transcript>: I don't like that. It's showing that points. Like that. It sucks.

02:37:52
<transcript>: Is the elixir app as buggy.

02:37:52
<transcript>: is

02:37:54
gitpush_gitpaid: @thdxr epic. cant believe i missed that

02:37:55
<transcript>: Is a giveaway one none of it's buggy.

02:37:55
<transcript>: you

02:37:57
cedpoilly: For the random list, maybe have the code generate the sequence before?

02:37:57
joshfinnie: \o how do you like elixir?

02:37:57
<transcript>: You guys.

02:38:08
vimcerf: it's not buggy, you all just suck - adam 2023

02:38:12
<transcript>: Okay, so here's what we need to do right now. We're updating categories, we're scrubbing last in. We're taking the name. Okay, that's good. Now we need to do it in the series.

02:38:14
<transcript>: Instead of this.

02:38:14
<transcript>: instead

02:38:17
<transcript>: Instead of updating label.

02:38:20
<transcript>: Here. Okay. Update column. This right here.

02:38:23
oetziofficial: my question is actually no troll, im really questioning it

02:38:25
<transcript>: Enum map.

02:38:27
<transcript>: So data.

02:38:33
glamshatterskull: i don't think any algorithmic random number generation can be truly considered random @OetziOfficial

02:38:39
<transcript>: How do I how do I use the function I just wrote in this update column. Thing scrub last in goes through an array of items and scrubbed keys.

02:38:39
<transcript>: okay

02:38:41
<transcript>: Okay. So here.

02:38:41
<transcript>: in a

02:38:43
<transcript>: In a map.

02:38:48
<transcript>: I think datum is the thing that I can just scrub, right? Yeah.

02:38:48
<transcript>: so here

02:38:50
<transcript>: So here.

02:38:50
<transcript>: this is

02:38:51
<transcript>: This is scrub.

02:38:57
glamshatterskull: so your point applies to a lot of languages afaik

02:38:58
oetziofficial: yea but the 10k entries would be reset each time we restart the runtime?

02:39:01
<transcript>: Last in and instead of it's going to just add the keys. We need to scrub the label.

02:39:05
<transcript>: Name lines, and color.

02:39:11
thdxr: wait Adam there's a bug in this code

02:39:13
greatgrievance: it's 1/10,000 per attempt

02:39:17
<transcript>: So now we shouldn't be using this update dateum. I think that just got replaced. Okay, we're going to leave it there for a second. My question is actually neutral. I'm really questioning it. What is it? Oetzi. You had a question.

02:39:17
<transcript>: but

02:39:23
whatizit: there's an edgecase where the discord webhook fails and doesn't notify the winner

02:39:24
<transcript>: But doesn't javascript save the state of the random since it's not really random. Hence every time you restart the stream code, the state is being reset.

02:39:26
<transcript>: What do you mean.

02:39:34
devagrawal09: it's random enough

02:39:37
<transcript>: Is that how jobs. What are you saying, Aletzi? You're saying, like if it's not one in the first thousand on any given stream, it'll never be one in the first thousand. Is that what you're saying.

02:39:37
greatgrievance: here's another playground with buttons you can tinker with: https://playground.solidjs.com/anonymous/6fb7b769-a802-4077-81cc-8155f08c78dd

02:39:41
<transcript>: Kuba you came and I got trolled.

02:39:41
<transcript>: it's because you

02:39:49
<transcript>: It's because you showed up. Don't worry, guys. I put some code in the rebase code base. So the next time he runs it, it changes the probability. Oh, my goodness.

02:39:49
<transcript>: you guys

02:39:51
<transcript>: You guys.

02:39:52
kubahasek: damn, gonna go now then

02:40:02
<transcript>: There's a bug in this code. What code? There probably. Is. That's okay. I'm expecting there'd be bugs in this code.

02:40:05
<transcript>: Again against the Bulls.

02:40:07
devagrawal09: "true random" is not possible because physics is a thing

02:40:07
<transcript>: Should scrub.

02:40:07
<transcript>: just the color

02:40:11
devagrawal09: but this is random enough

02:40:12
<transcript>: Just the color from the last 20. Now not the first five or the last, however many is left.

02:40:20
<transcript>: Yep. Okay. How's that looking? So if you're not a paid user, you can see the first five and then the rest of them.

02:40:22
<transcript>: Not very helpful.

02:40:31
<transcript>: Not very helpful at all. Maybe we'll put like a nice overlay overlay over this. That's like you should probably subscribe. Okay, now let's do the same thing to the table.

02:40:39
impostorengineer: i found out that chatgpt cannot do math :D

02:40:39
<transcript>: What's the bug? Dax? There's an edge case where the discord webhook fails and doesn't notify the winner. No.

02:40:41
coolpantstv: You guys remember when @thdxr leaked his twitter secret on stream ?

02:40:44
<transcript>: It's random enough. Here's another playground with buttons you can tinker with.

02:40:51
<transcript>: No, don't leave Cuba. You're fine. You're fine. True. Random is not possible. Because physics is the thing.

02:40:51
<transcript>: dev

02:40:52
<transcript>: Dev.

02:40:52
<transcript>: didn't

02:40:54
glamshatterskull: @devagrawal09 this

02:40:56
<transcript>: Didn't somebody random.org, isn't it? Based on the wind.

02:40:56
<transcript>: random

02:40:58
<transcript>: Random.

02:41:02
<transcript>: Org. Isn't this based on the wind or something.

02:41:02
<transcript>: why do i

02:41:03
greatgrievance: @devagrawal09 actually, there are quantum pcie rng cards

02:41:04
<transcript>: Why do I have it so zoomed in.

02:41:18
<transcript>: Montef. I already saw that one somebody subbed and I don't have a notification for it yet, so it's probably a resub, and I appreciate it. I want to tell you while you're typing out your message now that I appreciate your resub so much, Ram.org uses cookies. Sure. Allow all. Why not.

02:41:18
vapor__dev: white tee day lets gooooo

02:41:21
<transcript>: True Random Numbers service.

02:41:21
<transcript>: let's see

02:41:22
glamshatterskull: LUL

02:41:24
fragaverage: Math.random isn't truly random because it uses os time to seed or something like that

02:41:27
<transcript>: Let's see other sites. How does it work? Does it say how it works? Learn more about.

02:41:28
oetziofficial: just curios from my side

02:41:34
<transcript>: No. Where does it say that it actually uses the wind.

02:41:34
<transcript>: if i remember

02:41:35
glamshatterskull: some well ackshually happening

02:41:37
<transcript>: If I remember if this uses the wind.

02:41:42
monsef_ot: What I am coding hhhh

02:41:43
developmentrobot: it says it on the homepage

02:41:50
oetziofficial: im not trying to waste time

02:41:50
wagslane: Gotta wake up early as shit to watch adam

02:41:53
<transcript>: This is random enough. I found out that Chat Gyppidy cannot do math. You guys remember when the new one will be able to imposter right? When you get the plugins and you've got wolfram. You guys remember when dax leaked his Twitter secret on stream? Yeah. Dax. Remember when dax did that.

02:41:55
<transcript>: Dax.

02:42:00
<transcript>: Quantum pcie, rng cards? Whoa, it's quantum.

02:42:06
<transcript>: Wipe. T Day. Let's go, Alan. Welcome, Ian. Thank you for the resub.

02:42:06
borchborchtwitch: I have GPT logs in my github of it doing infinte summations

02:42:10
devagrawal09: the only thing chatgpt can do it talk and pretend it knows things, it doesn't actually know things

02:42:10
<transcript>: Four months, Ian, and it's a prime sub, no less.

02:42:10
<transcript>: ian i

02:42:14
<transcript>: Ian, I appreciate your prime subs. So much. Prime subs.

02:42:14
<transcript>: they're special

02:42:18
thdxr: idk why Adam hates me

02:42:20
<transcript>: They're special to me. Because they're special. There's only one of them. It's like you're giving me.

02:42:20
<transcript>: a piece

02:42:30
greatgrievance: something like this: https://www.idquantique.com/random-number-generation/products/quantis-qrng-pcie/

02:42:32
statsndata: Good Morning chat

02:42:35
<transcript>: A piece of you. You only have one of them. And you're saying, Adam, you get to have this. That means so much to me. And look at that. Just like that Leonard gave me his prime set. I really wasn't trying to emotionally nip it at you. I'm not emotionally deep enough to manipulate.

02:42:41
<transcript>: I appreciate your prime sub as well. Annery. I really do everything I said. I mean.

02:42:45
trivenge: Morning. Can't stay at all but wanted to drop by and say hi quickly. Hope you and that dax fella are doing well lately.

02:42:46
iannery: you manipulated me!! good morning btw

02:42:50
<transcript>: Some well actually happening math random isn't truly random because it uses OS time to seed or something like that. Just curious from my side.

02:42:50
<transcript>: what i

02:42:52
<transcript>: What I am coding.

02:42:54
<transcript>: What.

02:42:54
<transcript>: monsef

02:42:56
<transcript>: Monsef. What are your coding.

02:43:02
<transcript>: I don't remember the conversation we were having. I'm sorry.

02:43:02
<transcript>: says it on

02:43:05
<transcript>: Says it on the home page. Oh.

02:43:05
<transcript>: home says

02:43:07
<transcript>: Home says right here, that the wind.

02:43:11
<transcript>: They've got like devices listening to the wind or something.

02:43:24
<transcript>: Fine for me offers true random numbers to anyone on the Internet. The randomness comes from atmospheric noise, which for many purposes is better than the suitor random number algorithms. So as long as the atmosphere is random.

02:43:24
<transcript>: i don't know

02:43:29
<transcript>: I don't know. I guess one could say it's not random. What is random anyway.

02:43:29
<transcript>: is random

02:43:31
<transcript>: Is random possible.

02:43:37
<transcript>: Not trying to waste time. Oh, no, you're good. Otsy. I didn't think you were.

02:43:37
<transcript>: unlike

02:43:39
<transcript>: Unlike DAX.

02:43:39
<transcript>: and

02:43:42
devagrawal09: lol we summoned statsndata

02:43:44
wagslane: Universe is deterministic, were in trouble

02:43:46
<transcript>: And frag who were trying to waste my time. I know no one else is trying to waste my time. Wags Lane got to wake up early to watch Adam.

02:43:46
<transcript>: yes

02:43:50
fragaverage: yo hold up

02:43:51
<transcript>: Yes, I do start pretty early. Wags welcome to my chat.

02:43:51
<transcript>: you're not per

02:43:56
monsef_ot: You called me in the middle of a fight with a Bug

02:44:05
wagslane: I am the Lane from Twitter haha

02:44:06
<transcript>: You're not per chance the wags that I know from springfield, right? That I worked with at the geek Squad. Different wags. I think Wags has shown up in my Twitch stream before. So you're probably not that wags because this is your first message. I have gpt logs in my GitHub of it doing infinite summations.

02:44:08
gitpush_gitpaid: yea adam how many people are in the stream when you start?

02:44:09
glamshatterskull: i would think true randomness would look less random than what we think randomness looks like.

02:44:14
wagslane: Not wags

02:44:18
<transcript>: The only thing Chad gbd can do is talk and pretend it knows things. It doesn't actually know things. It's true. I don't know why Adam hates me. I don't hate you. Dax.

02:44:18
<transcript>: don't hate

02:44:23
gitpush_gitpaid: like 6 am is wild. who the hell is on twitch

02:44:27
<transcript>: Don't hate you, not wags. Different wags. Okay, good to know, but I'd like you just the same wags. Thank you for joining and talking in my chat.

02:44:34
glamshatterskull: @gitpush_gitpaid the earth is round

02:44:37
statsndata: I was summoned by Adam's twitch stream reminder on Twitter lol

02:44:37
thdxr: Adam is so mean to me

02:44:39
vapor__dev: wags from "billions"?

02:44:42
<transcript>: Okay. I need to keep moving. Trivia's here can't say at all, but wanted to drop by and say Hi quickly. Hope you and the dax fella are doing well lately. We're doing great. Triv, it's so good to see you. I've missed you. I thought about the other day. I didn't seem trivial. A bit.

02:44:45

02:44:47
<transcript>: i'm so

02:44:56
vapor__dev: @thdxr HSWP

02:44:58
<transcript>: I'm so sorry. Lanerry did not mean to. We summoned Stats and data. We're stats and data. Good morning, chat. Stats and Data is here. Universe is deterministic. We're in trouble. There's nothing random.

02:45:05
<transcript>: You'll hold up, Frank. What am I holding up for? You wasting my time. What are you talking about? You called me in the middle of a fight with a bug.

02:45:05
<transcript>: oh i

02:45:10
<transcript>: Oh, I got you also frag. I still haven't gotten over the whole UK thing. You guys.

02:45:16
<transcript>: Just I don't know it's too much for me too much.

02:45:20
thdxr: adam beat me up once because I brought him the wrong coffee

02:45:21
<transcript>: You're Lane from Twitter. Oh, wags, you're like Boot dev Lane.

02:45:23
<transcript>: Is that the Lane that you are.

02:45:25
fragaverage: Its not US GUYS, we dont make the decisions

02:45:26
wagslane: Yeah

02:45:27
nexxeln: this is truly a scam

02:45:35
fragaverage: @thdxr I believe this

02:45:41
nexxeln: hello i am back

02:45:43
<transcript>: Git push. Yeah. Adam, how many people are in the stream when you start? When I start, it's usually like 30 to 50, someone who's here early. Frag. Is it like when I when I first start, when I come back from my intro? Is it something like 30 to 50 people usually something like that. It's not a lot.

02:45:52
schrew: People are here when you first start? timezones are crazy

02:45:54
<transcript>: I would think true randomness would look less random than what we think randomness looks like. Oh, maybe it's so random. It's not random. Is that what you're saying to me.

02:45:56
fragaverage: yeah, around that. "its not alot" he says LUL

02:45:58
thdxr: when you first start it's 0

02:45:58
greatgrievance: 30-50 is a lot for a dev stream

02:46:07
<transcript>: 06:00. A.m. Is wild. Who the hell is on twitch? Yeah, it's me and study time. We're on twitch at 06:00. A.m.. Sometimes kitsy, sometimes Kitsie's on. Not a lot of us in the software and Dev category.

02:46:07
<transcript>: the earth

02:46:09
neochromer: Test test hello

02:46:09
<transcript>: The Earth is round.

02:46:11
<transcript>: What.

02:46:16
<transcript>: I was summoned by adam's twitch Stream Reminder on Twitter.

02:46:19
vimcerf: @NeoChromer didn't work, try again

02:46:19
<transcript>: Dax, I'm not mean to you wags from billions.

02:46:21
neochromer: You mean Kitze

02:46:25
neochromer: @vimcerf, damn

02:46:32
<transcript>: Okay. I really need to. I really need to do some stuff. Why am I just reading chat? I did not beat you up because you brought me the wrong coffee. Did you really bring me the wrong coffee deck? I don't remember this. Did you do that.

02:46:32
<transcript>: at rein

02:46:32
gitpush_gitpaid: 30-50 people isnt a lot? sir i dont think i could get 30-50 people to look in my direction if i was on fire Kappa

02:46:33
<transcript>: At reinvent.

02:46:39
<transcript>: Okay. I got to keep moving.

02:46:39
<transcript>: why am

02:46:42
gitpush_gitpaid: yea get back to coding. focus on that.

02:46:47
<transcript>: Why am I so distracted? Guys, help me focus when you first started zero. Well, that's true. Next. Actually.

02:46:47
<transcript>: i never

02:46:49
thdxr: wow he forgot he beat me up

02:46:50
<transcript>: I never looked at it and seen zero viewers if I'm being honest.

02:46:50
<transcript>: i start

02:46:57
thdxr: most traumatic moment of my life

02:46:57
wagslane: We gotta write more interesting comments so Adam won't get anything done

02:47:00
<transcript>: I start the stream. I made my little tweet by the time I look over the screen, usually there's like four or five people, at least, so I've never seen zero. Don't let that change. Please keep showing up.

02:47:04
<transcript>: 30 50 is a lot for Dev stream. Oh I'm sorry great revenue. So.

02:47:04
<transcript>: if that

02:47:10
thdxr: we're 100% not going to help you focus

02:47:11
<transcript>: If that sounded like I was coming off as out of touch. I probably am out of touch, but also I didn't mean to belittle.

02:47:16
<transcript>: It's a lot. It's a lot. It's just like throughout the stream. It seems to grow. The morning is quiet.

02:47:16
<transcript>: it's my

02:47:20
<transcript>: It's my infinite little close knit circle from the EU.

02:47:31
<transcript>: And India and Asia and Australia. We all hang out for a little bit. And then the US people start waking up. And then it gets a little more crowded around here. And that's the trolls. I'll be honest.

02:47:31
<transcript>: when dax shows

02:47:33
thdxr: if you want to see 0 go check the number of commits you did today for statmuse

02:47:35
<transcript>: When dax shows up and starts trolling me. Neocromers. Here. Hello.

02:47:35
<transcript>: kits

02:47:37
greatgrievance: oh no, i didn't feel belittled, I'm just saying it's a solid crowd

02:47:39
devagrawal09: honestly i was very surprised i got 20+ viewers for my 3rd ever stream

02:47:40
<transcript>: Kitsie? Did I say kitsie? Wrong? Is it not kitsie? Is that not how you say it.

02:47:43
nft_scam: :tf: u mad?

02:47:44
bodhihawken: australia for the win

02:47:45
<transcript>: Have I been saying kitsy Ron this whole time? Okay, let's get back to coding.

02:47:45
<transcript>: he forgot to beat me

02:47:48
<transcript>: He forgot to beat me up. Most dramatic ones.

02:47:50
kubahasek: home today, but can't usually make it here haha

02:47:54
ghostyx101: Keetsuh

02:47:55
<transcript>: You didn't feel below. Okay, good. It's a solid crowd.

02:47:58
vapor__dev: @thdxr jesus

02:48:01
<transcript>: Dev, you got 20 plus for your third ever stream. That's actually awesome.

02:48:01
<transcript>: i don't think i got

02:48:03
borchborchtwitch: you can generate prime numbers with my code if you want to use them for randomness im pretty sure you can also get random values with pi^2/2 and other multiples

02:48:05
<transcript>: I don't think I got 20 plus for the first weeks.

02:48:05
neochromer: kitze - e like electricity

02:48:07
<transcript>: That's fantastic.

02:48:07
<transcript>: austral

02:48:07
statsndata: Has Adam already gone on a gpt LLM tangent this morning yet?

02:48:11
<transcript>: Australia for the Win Home Day. I just keep reading. I'm going to stop reading.

02:48:11
<transcript>: kitsie like

02:48:14
<transcript>: Kitsie like electricity.

02:48:16
greatgrievance: imagine 20-30 people standing behind your desk, watching over your shoulder...

02:48:18
<transcript>: Okay. Did that code work? Did we say it worked.

02:48:23
<transcript>: Yes, it worked. Now let's do the table.

02:48:26
<transcript>: I guess I'm just getting rid of all this code.

02:48:33
gitpush_gitpaid: we need to help adam focus otherwise hes going to stream less so he can get work done.. we need to purposely ignore Adam.

02:48:39
<transcript>: That was not needed anymore. We have this generic scrub last in. Feels good. Now let's do the table. The table is up here. Grids, update rows. We go through.

02:48:39
<transcript>: every

02:48:43
<transcript>: Every grid. And we do update.

02:48:43
trivenge: I actually had to take a flight to north Carolina to help assist Mr beast with a project believe it or not lol. So thats partly why i haven't been around, that and my sleep schedule is a little off. I will be back on my sleep schedule sooner than later. Gotta jet. Also, will we see dax and adam on videos with cuts back and forth when you talk or show both on video during podcasts? You guys should definitely do more podcasts over time and definitely collaborate with people for sure.

02:48:45
<transcript>: This should actually be.

02:48:52
<transcript>: Update grid.

02:48:55
<transcript>: Right.

02:48:58
thdxr: @triveNge wow!

02:48:59
<transcript>: Wait.

02:48:59
<transcript>: no

02:49:00
<transcript>: No.

02:49:00
<transcript>: what am i

02:49:00
vimcerf: @gitpush_gitpaid no.

02:49:09
<transcript>: What am I talking about? I don't know. Update rows. These names are so confusing. I wish I could have them all in one function, but my brain just can't handle it.

02:49:18
monsef_ot: I woke up earlier I studies a little bit and then went back to sleep, you know you start streaming at 12:00 pm in my timezone

02:49:19
<transcript>: I can't handle once I get that far down the nestedness, my brain starts melting, so update rows, grids. We do update row.

02:49:19
<transcript>: okay

02:49:21
<transcript>: Okay. So what we want to do.

02:49:21
<transcript>: here

02:49:24
<transcript>: Here instead of taking.

02:49:24
<transcript>: account

02:49:28
<transcript>: Account of rows. We want to say.

02:49:30
<transcript>: Scrub. Right here, right.

02:49:32
<transcript>: Scrub.

02:49:32
<transcript>: last

02:49:34
<transcript>: Last in.

02:49:39
<transcript>: It's the rows, the count, and then the keys.

02:49:43
<transcript>: So the keys are what.

02:49:49
<transcript>: Oh, it's. Oh, right. I need to do all the keys. Okay, I got to think about this.

02:49:54
gitpush_gitpaid: @gitpush_gitpaid less streaming means less chances at winning the macbook pro Kappa

02:49:58
<transcript>: These rows are complicated.

02:50:07
thdxr: I need help brainstorming how we can distract adam

02:50:20
<transcript>: Oh, that's going to be so hard. So the columns. Okay, the columns. Tell me the keys that I need to go in order. And this is going to be a nightmare. Maybe Chad Jippity can help me. Muriel, thank you for the follow.

02:50:26
laame: how long will the @k register get?

02:50:29
trivenge: Idk, adam seems distractable lol

02:50:30
<transcript>: Okay, listen, this is going to be tough. We're going to rely on chat jippity, but basically, inside grids. We have columns.

02:50:32
<transcript>: This key. Right here.

02:50:32
<transcript>: for each

02:50:39
<transcript>: For each grid, we got to get the columns. We got to go through the keys in the list of columns.

02:50:41
nexxeln: !followage

02:50:41
fossabot: @nexxeln nexxeln has been following adamdotdev for 8 months, 22 days and 2 hours

02:50:42
<transcript>: And we got.

02:50:44
mecoupz: how many adam bucks do you guys have? @thdxr  we need to spam the entries then he'll waste another 10 minutes

02:50:45
<transcript>: Leave out the first one. The rest of them.

02:50:45
<transcript>: we need

02:50:46
coolpantstv: I think if we keep talking about the ozarks he will want to join in

02:50:47
vimcerf: @gitpush_gitpaid it's a scam.

02:50:50
<transcript>: We need to delete those keys. So complicated.

02:50:55
thdxr: ADAM ADAM ADAM ADAM LOOK HERE

02:50:55
<transcript>: So complicated. Okay, so here, let's see.

02:50:57
gitpush_gitpaid: @gitpush_gitpaid maybe youre a scam

02:50:59
borchborchtwitch: for range not equal

02:51:00
<transcript>: To get the list of keys.

02:51:01
coolpantstv: @thdxr what's your favorite thing about the Ozarks?

02:51:02
<transcript>: Here.

02:51:02
<transcript>: i need to

02:51:02
thdxr: once we have his attention everyoen distract him

02:51:04
coolpantstv: Mine is all the nature

02:51:07
nexxeln: git push git paid is a scam @gitpush_gitpaid

02:51:07
<transcript>: I need to take the grid. Okay, so categories, categories equals grid.

02:51:13
<transcript>: Is this how I do it.

02:51:15
<transcript>: Wait.

02:51:17
thdxr: @CoolpantsTV Ozarks....is that like the tv show?

02:51:20
nexxeln: i have pushed multiple times but never got paid

02:51:20
<transcript>: Can I do this actually.

02:51:21
thdxr: does anyone really live there?

02:51:24
thdxr: is that a real place?

02:51:24
<transcript>: Does this work in elixir categories.

02:51:29
<transcript>: Is that like an unstructuring? Should I do that.

02:51:33
<transcript>: Dax, I need your help.

02:51:33
<transcript>: adam adam

02:51:33
wagslane: Adam doesn't live in the Ozarks. Fake news.

02:51:34
gitpush_gitpaid: @nexxeln LUL maybe i am... maybe i am

02:51:37
greatgrievance: you can pattern match

02:51:37
<transcript>: Adam. Adam. Adam. Look here. What do you doing? Are you just trying to attract me.

02:51:37
<transcript>: next

02:51:39
mecoupz: we are all in the matrix

02:51:41
<transcript>: Next has been following me for eight months. Oh, my goodness.

02:51:41
borchborchtwitch: do for keys in list not equal keys you dont want

02:51:43
laame: I'm just curious to see what will happen if he presses `q@k`

02:51:45
<transcript>: Dax, I need your help with some elixir.

02:51:53
<transcript>: Now I'm scrolling because I want the answer to a question.

02:51:55
coolpantstv: People call it the scammer capital of the midwest @thdxr

02:51:57
greatgrievance: or use atom access

02:51:57
<transcript>: Because I want to see if wags is boot Lane.

02:51:57
thdxr: what u need

02:52:03
wagslane: I am boot lane

02:52:06
<transcript>: Yes, he is. Okay. I just found the answer. Sorry. I was just scrolling because I realized I asked a question. I never saw the answer. What do I need? So I need.

02:52:08
trivenge: Anyways i gotra jet lol. Take care. Kick some butt. Gotta get going

02:52:13
<transcript>: Or use Adam access. Oh, great. Grievance. You're good at this. I forgot. You can pattern match. So what I want to do.

02:52:16
mecoupz: "This is the voiceline of thdxr, please record your message after the beep"

02:52:17
<transcript>: Grid has a property categories and inside.

02:52:17
<transcript>: that let's

02:52:20
<transcript>: That let's look at it inside.

02:52:20
<transcript>: that

02:52:22
thdxr: is grid a map?

02:52:22
daglee: @adamdotdev You should really do a pomodoro timer. :P

02:52:31
thdxr: don't you need a percent sign

02:52:33
<transcript>: That. I'm sorry. It's called columns. Inside the grid. There's a columns. And it's an array of items that look like this. I need to get this property row item key from every column. So I guess I need to map.

02:52:33
<transcript>: map

02:52:35
<transcript>: Map, columns.

02:52:38
<transcript>: Okay. Do you see what I'm saying.

02:52:38
<transcript>: i should really

02:52:41
thdxr: just use my lib

02:52:41
<transcript>: I should really do. You don't need a percent sign, okay.

02:52:45
<transcript>: Don't you need a persistent sign? I don't know what I need is.

02:52:48
<transcript>: In JavaScript.

02:52:48
<transcript>: i need

02:52:50
<transcript>: I need grid.

02:52:50
<transcript>: oh that

02:52:55
<transcript>: Oh, that's not even how you start doing a javascript comment. That was best. That was awesome.

02:52:55
<transcript>: i need to do grid

02:52:56
<transcript>: I need to do grid.

02:52:56
<transcript>: col

02:52:58
<transcript>: Columns.

02:52:58
<transcript>: map

02:52:59
vimcerf: @thdxr beginThis

02:52:59
thdxr: https://hexdocs.pm/dynamic/Dynamic.html#get/3

02:52:59
<transcript>: Map.

02:52:59
<transcript>: okay

02:53:01
<transcript>: Okay C.

02:53:08
<transcript>: Row, item key. That's what I need to do. Okay.

02:53:11
<transcript>: It needs to be like keys.

02:53:11
<transcript>: so here

02:53:12
greatgrievance: grid[:columns] or Map.get(grid, 'columns')

02:53:13
<transcript>: So here's some typescript.

02:53:13
<transcript>: or

02:53:15
<transcript>: Or I guess JavaScript.

02:53:15
<transcript>: what if i just

02:53:18
<transcript>: What if I just yank this.

02:53:20
<transcript>: And I put it into Chat, gbt.

02:53:31
<transcript>: Wait. Did you just give me the answer? Grid columns or map git grid columns to see what I want to do on a map, every column and just get the keys. All I need is the keys.

02:53:31
thdxr: wait it's not nested?

02:53:34
<transcript>: I take that back.

02:53:36
<transcript>: I just need.

02:53:44
<transcript>: Everything but the last key. This is what I need or everything. With the first key.

02:53:47
<transcript>: Can someone tell me how to do this.

02:53:53
<transcript>: I need keys, just like this. Typescript code in elixir. I'm just going to do this. I'm going to say, yank, we're going to go to chat.

02:53:53
<transcript>: gyppity

02:53:55
<transcript>: Gyppity.

02:53:55
<transcript>: we're going

02:53:57
thdxr: say that again

02:53:59
<transcript>: We're going to say, Please convert this code for me because you are smart.

02:54:01
<transcript>: No matter what people say.

02:54:04
thdxr: you need everything but the first key?

02:54:06
<transcript>: I need to convert.

02:54:06
<transcript>: this javascript

02:54:08
<transcript>: This JavaScript.

02:54:12
<transcript>: If it to elixir.

02:54:17
thdxr: the Enum module has everything you could ever need and works on maps

02:54:19
jmejam: Just got here, busy day. If there are any good reasons, why Elixir? :)

02:54:24
<transcript>: Wait, it's not nested. Say it again. You need everything but the first key? Yeah, everything but the first key.

02:54:37
<transcript>: Great grievance showed me how to get the value out. The enum module has everything you could ever need and works on maps. Jme just got here. Busy day. Is there any good reasons why elixir? We chose elixir at St. Mu.

02:54:37
<transcript>: muws because

02:54:39
<transcript>: Muws because.

02:54:39
<transcript>: one

02:54:41
<transcript>: One of our engineers, a web Dev.

02:54:41
<transcript>: was

02:54:53
thdxr: how many times does this question get asked

02:54:53
<transcript>: Was really into Elixir, and he wanted to write more Elixir in his life and in production. And we said, Run with it. Go for it sounds fantastic. And that's what we have now we have a bunch of elixir.

02:54:55
thdxr: add a fossabot

02:54:56
<transcript>: Okay. Here we go.

02:54:56
<transcript>: grid

02:54:57
<transcript>: Grid? What is this.

02:54:57
<transcript>: okay

02:55:02
<transcript>: Okay, that's just the data. So enum map go through each column.

02:55:02
<transcript>: can you do

02:55:03
jmejam: That's sweet. I know someone who did similar with Scala

02:55:05
<transcript>: Can you do that? Just grid dot columns like that.

02:55:06
nexxeln: !watchtime

02:55:08
<transcript>: I feel like you can't do that.

02:55:08
<transcript>: oh yeah

02:55:12
nexxeln: !commands

02:55:13
fossabot: @nexxeln Channel commands are available at: https://fossabot.com/adamdotdev/commands

02:55:13
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, I should add a fossil bet. Dax, you can log into fuss.

02:55:14
<transcript>: fussabot

02:55:14
<transcript>: fussabot and add that

02:55:16
<transcript>: Fussabot and add that for me. That'd be great. Thanks.

02:55:16
<transcript>: all my moder

02:55:22
<transcript>: All my moderators can log in and do that. I know someone who did similar with Scala.

02:55:23
devagrawal09: fossabet

02:55:29
<transcript>: Can you add that command, or do I need to have one of my other moderators whose use will do it.

02:55:30
thdxr: interreeessting.....

02:55:35
<transcript>: I'm being kind of mean. I'm sorry, dax. Oh, no.

02:55:35
<transcript>: you can't do it

02:55:36
g4goodlooking: you look like a rich man

02:55:36
<transcript>: You can't do it. Never mind.

02:55:38
vimcerf: @thdxr add a command about the scam

02:55:39
thdxr: I'll do it don't worry

02:55:40
devagrawal09: you need new mods?

02:55:40
coolpantstv: @adamdotdev why would you tell him that

02:55:41
<transcript>: You're so good at trolling.

02:55:43
mecoupz: that moderator thing is also a scam right?

02:55:48
wagslane: Do you have a fairly polyglot stack at starmuse? Or is it lotsa elixir?

02:55:50
thdxr: @vimcerf that's what I was gonna do

02:55:51
<transcript>: Good looking. I look like a rich man. What about me? Looks like a rich man. Don't add any scans. Oh, no. Oh, no. I need new mods. I think I do. Dev.

02:55:51
<transcript>: i think

02:55:52
nexxeln: !subs

02:55:52
fossabot: All $ from subs go to support a charity in need

02:55:53
<transcript>: I think that should just be a VIP.

02:55:53
<transcript>: it's that

02:55:55
<transcript>: It's that.

02:55:55
<transcript>: why would you

02:56:00
<transcript>: Why would you tell them that? Wow, what was I thinking? The moderator thing is also a scam, right.

02:56:07
nexxeln: i can volunteer for a mod

02:56:08
statsndata: The 4k quality gives rich man haha

02:56:14
thdxr: !macbook

02:56:14
<transcript>: Do you have a fairly polyglot Sacket statues? Is it lots of elixir? So wags. We have a ton of elixir. Like, oh, my God, it's so much elixir. Look at this. I'm just going to scroll and look, I'm just in the Lib directory, okay.

02:56:14
<transcript>: we're just

02:56:15
fossabot: the macbook giveaway is actually a scam, it does not work

02:56:17
<transcript>: We're just in the Lib directory.

02:56:17
<transcript>: mothra and

02:56:28
vimcerf: LUL

02:56:29
mecoupz: LUL

02:56:33
devagrawal09: just show the %age on github

02:56:37
<transcript>: Mothra. And then look at all these folders. Look at all these, just everything. It's just so much elixir code. Oh, my goodness. Okay, that's migrations. That's not fair. But that's just the stuff I have expanded. There's so much that's not expanded. Like, every one of these folders is just full of files. Like, oh, my. It's so much just hurts my brain.

02:56:37
<transcript>: that's

02:56:42
g4goodlooking: you talk like those guys from hunger games who throw food at us from the sky

02:56:43
<transcript>: That's why the lsp so slow, I think, but we have a fairly polyglot stack, so we have F sharp as our.

02:56:47
<transcript>: Gamma Service, which is what our does our nlp stuff.

02:56:50
<transcript>: We have react.

02:56:50
<transcript>: in the front end

02:56:53
mecoupz: @thdxr you're a genius

02:56:59
mecoupz: !macbook

02:56:59
fossabot: the macbook giveaway is actually a scam, it does not work

02:56:59
<transcript>: In the front end. So it's an Elixir Phoenix app, but it hosts kind of like a React front end. We're replacing all that part the elixir and the React is going to replace with Astro.

02:57:07
devagrawal09: React, F#, and Elixir? might as well throw in some Haskell

02:57:07
thdxr: !elixir

02:57:08
mecoupz: LUL

02:57:08
<transcript>: Yeah. There's a bunch of stuff. We have a bunch of javascript and typescript. Bunch of little one off Lambda functions that do stuff based on.

02:57:08
<transcript>: services calling

02:57:08
fossabot: Statmuse uses Elixir because an early engineer particularly enjoyed it. It's a great language and an intro to functional programming so you should check it out https://elixir-lang.org/

02:57:11
<transcript>: Services calling them and stuff. There's just a bunch of stuff.

02:57:14
wagslane: Wow, sweet.

02:57:15
codingbrah: @thdxr primeagenPiq

02:57:15
<transcript>: You can pattern match. We are all in the matrix.

02:57:20
<transcript>: Adam doesn't live in the ozarks. What did I scroll up too far.

02:57:34
<transcript>: Did I scroll up? Yes, I did. Should really do a pomodoro timer. I really should. How did I get way up there? What was I doing? React F sharp and elixir might as well throw in some Haskell. I think someone wanted to. Oh, no, we do have some Haskell.

02:57:36
<transcript>: Hang on.

02:57:38
fragaverage: whats the average aws bill of statmuse?

02:57:39
devagrawal09: LMAO

02:57:47
<transcript>: We do have some Haskell because somebody was like, hey, it'd be cool if we could ride some Haskell one of these things. There was haskel involved. I don't know if it's this. No, actually, it was an internal thing. It was an analytics tool.

02:57:47
<transcript>: that my

02:58:02
<transcript>: That my co founder wanted something to see number of queries or something. And they used Haskell because they were just like we should use Haskel it's cool. People are nerds about it. So there is there's Haskell we got everything at statues. You name it. We got the language. Probably.

02:58:05
<transcript>: There's definitely some C sharp.

02:58:06
mecoupz: @adamdotdev it'd be easier to count the languages that statmuse does NOT use lol

02:58:10
coolpantstv: COBOL

02:58:18
<transcript>: What's the average? Aws, Bill. Great question, frag. I don't know if anyone cares if I share this. I'm going to share it because I don't care. It's $15,000 a month. Roughly. We fluctuate between 10,000 15,000 for a long time.

02:58:27
<transcript>: Me, coops, it'd be easier to count the languages that sap mes does not use. That's right. We don't use cobalt. It's true. Oh, did I get an answer from Chat? Jippity.

02:58:27
<transcript>: do i get an answer

02:58:28
fragaverage: 50k a month? Interesting

02:58:30
<transcript>: Do I get an answer? No. Where am I.

02:58:30
<transcript>: what am

02:58:33
devagrawal09: is it serverless

02:58:35
<transcript>: What am I doing? Here we go. Does this work? Is this real code.

02:58:39
<transcript>: Is this.

02:58:39
<transcript>: idiomatic

02:58:41
<transcript>: Idiomatic elixir.

02:58:41
<transcript>: if not

02:58:42
greatgrievance: https://gist.github.com/cklmercer/575a104fa8ff6bd9bb93f2e18b7c0dd5

02:58:44
<transcript>: If not please give me.

02:58:46
greatgrievance: I made a gist for you

02:58:48
<transcript>: A solution that is.

02:58:50
coolpantstv: @adamdotdev have you looked into Vercel, might help keep your costs down instead of using AWS

02:58:50
<transcript>: Is it serverless.

02:58:50
<transcript>: no oh no

02:58:56
<transcript>: No. Oh, no, I didn't say 50. It's 15. Sorry. Ten to 15,000 a month.

02:58:56
<transcript>: dev

02:59:00
<transcript>: Dev. It's not really serverless. So in fact.

02:59:00
<transcript>: we shipped the first

02:59:00
devagrawal09: @CoolpantsTV LUL

02:59:05
<transcript>: We shipped the first version of stat muse on aws before lambda was announced.

02:59:05
<transcript>: not that

02:59:06
nefine_: @CoolpantsTV KEKW

02:59:07
fragaverage: oh sorry I misheard. Thats a nice amount

02:59:09
thdxr: adam hasn't noticed yet

02:59:10
<transcript>: Not that lambda is serverless, but I mean not that it's the only thing that is just like.

02:59:24
vimcerf: @FragAverage adam would only spend 50k on a mac

02:59:24
<transcript>: The current world of serverless. As we know it all these managed services and functions as a service. All of that stuff didn't even exist. So we built it originally. It's just easy to instances, and then we I think eventually move to elastic Beanstalk.

02:59:24
<transcript>: and then now

02:59:28
<transcript>: And then now I think we're running a bunch of stuff on Fargate.

02:59:30
<transcript>: But we do now just have all this baggage.

02:59:30
<transcript>: of stuff

02:59:36
<transcript>: Of stuff that was put into the runtimes or into the OS environments and.

02:59:39
fragaverage: @FragAverage LUL

02:59:47
mecoupz: @thdxr we need a counter how long it takes him to notice

02:59:50
<transcript>: It just got harder and harder to move it all to something serverless. That said We're rewriting the web layer. So mothra is what's called what I'm working on right now. This elixir app is moving into an astro app, and that will be serverless. So it will be deployed.

02:59:50
<transcript>: using

02:59:55
<transcript>: Using ssds astrocyte construct so we're moving more serverless.

02:59:59
thdxr: it's been a few min at least

03:00:05
<transcript>: But we've just got a ton of stuff that at this point it will never be served. List like our databases. It's just rds, not even aurora. I think it's just like raw.

03:00:05
<transcript>: raw

03:00:10
<transcript>: Raw RDS like our postgres database is just RDS.

03:00:10
<transcript>: we've got

03:00:11
<transcript>: We've got.

03:00:25
<transcript>: There's something else I thought of. Oh, we do have some serverless stuff. So we have a bunch of media stuff. So we have some image generation stuff and some speech synthesis stuff that is serverless. It's all just like on demand compute stuff.

03:00:25
wagslane: Nothing wrong with postgres!!

03:00:35
<transcript>: I haven't noticed. What? Yet? Oh, no, dax. What? What did I not notice? What did you do? Oh, great grievance. Did you give me? You gave me a gist. Oh, my word. Great grieving.

It's been a few minutes, at least. What are you guys talking about? Nothing wrong with postdress. Definitely nothing wrong with postcraft. I just wish it wasn't rds because it's so expensive.

03:01:59
<transcript>: i wish we had

03:02:00
coolpantstv: Ideally we get there everyday

03:02:05
<transcript>: I wish we had something more serverless for our data. I guess at this point though, statmus usage.

03:02:05
<transcript>: it's such

03:02:12
<transcript>: It's such a global audience, and it's D to C. So we have enough people constantly using stat news that I don't know, that we'd save a ton.

03:02:32
<transcript>: From not having something like rds that's always running like the serverless billing picture probably doesn't help us much. It might help us a little bit with ops. We've had a few little things where it's like, Man, it's annoying that I have to deal with this, but I guess at this point, I don't know. We probably wouldn't benefit from switching that much. Don't worry, Adam. It's nothing now. I'm really worried.

03:02:44
<transcript>: You can use shorthand notation for those functions as well. Okay, we're going to do it right now. Dad. Joke. What is that like? To start a diet? But I've got too much on my plate right now. Oh, my word. Why did you add that joke.

03:17:07

03:17:07
<transcript>: they're objects

03:17:11
<transcript>: They're objects, so they're not binaries, and they're not. Oh, that's the problem.

03:17:36
<transcript>: Or well.

03:17:43
<transcript>: What would happen if I just made it an empty object.

03:17:46
<transcript>: Could probably break the UI.

03:17:46
<transcript>: so i

03:17:49
<transcript>: So I need a new function.

03:17:53
<transcript>: That instead of just taking keys to scrub.

03:18:00
<transcript>: It goes into each object.

03:18:00
<transcript>: with said

03:18:03
<transcript>: With said key. Oh, no, I don't. I don't need that. No.

03:18:09
<transcript>: I just don't need to call scrub last in yet. I need to call. Let's see here.

03:18:12
<transcript>: Need to go through each key.

03:18:15
<transcript>: In each object.

03:18:21
thdxr: tbh I'm not wasting anyone's time more than I'm wasting myself

03:18:24
<transcript>: Let's see instead of scrub. Last in here.

03:18:24
<transcript>: this

03:18:27
<transcript>: This is going to be a different function.

03:18:28
<transcript>: It's going to be.

03:18:31
<transcript>: Like enum.

03:18:33
<transcript>: No.

03:18:42
<transcript>: What is this? Each row is an object. So I need to do.

03:18:42
<transcript>: map

03:18:46
thdxr: my own*

03:18:48
<transcript>: Map. Put on each key. Okay. No. So it's the keys? Yeah.

03:18:48
<transcript>: en

03:18:56
<transcript>: Enum map. Okay, let's try this. I'm probably going to mess this up, but enoch map on keys.

03:19:02
<transcript>: Okay. So you pass in the enum, and then the function what it should do, right? Yeah.

03:19:02
<transcript>: so

03:19:04
greatgrievance: so, Enum.to_list -> Enum.filter -> Enum.reduce

03:19:04
<transcript>: So keys.

03:19:04
<transcript>: enum

03:19:07
<transcript>: Enum map.

03:19:13
<transcript>: Keys, and then the row.

03:19:13
<transcript>: no

03:19:15
<transcript>: No. And then a new function.

03:19:17
<transcript>: Map.

03:19:17
<transcript>: or

03:19:20
<transcript>: Or. I'm sorry. Enum. No.

03:19:30
<transcript>: Think, Adam, use your brain. Okay, I'm focused. I'm ignoring chat. Oh, no, great. Grievance. I'm not ignoring chat. Enum. Two list. Enum. Filter. Enum. Reduce.

03:19:30
greatgrievance: err Map.to_list, not enum

03:19:33
<transcript>: Maybe.

03:19:33
<transcript>: map

03:19:37
<transcript>: Map to list, not enum, so map to list.

03:19:37
<transcript>: what i need to do

03:19:40
<transcript>: What I need to do is I need to go through.

03:19:41

<transcript>: In rows. I need to go through each key.

03:22:51
laytanl_: plain old for loops

03:22:53
<transcript>: And in that property is another map that I need to scrub.

03:22:59
<transcript>: A list of properties on oh, man, that's so hard to articulate. Okay.

03:23:11

<transcript>: No, nothing changed.

03:26:50
<transcript>: Update each map in the list using the scrub lesson.

03:26:50
<transcript>: and a list of

<transcript>: And a list of keys. Well, no, you misunderstood.

03:26:54
<transcript>: en

03:27:01
<transcript>: Enum map list of maps for the map we want to scrub last in map in keys. Okay.

03:27:04
<transcript>: But.

03:27:14
<transcript>: No, they misunderstood it's too many levels deep, too many levels deep? Oh, jeez, Allen, don't clip me.

thdxr: yep

neochromer: very sus

03:27:48
<transcript>: So for each row. Okay. Maybe I'm going to make a new function because I feel like I just can't think this many levels. Deep. Update.

03:27:51

bodhihawken: @vapor__dev oh nice iv got a project where we write pydantic types and automatically generate typescript types

03:28:00
<transcript>: I don't know how to name this function yet but we're going to pass in a row and account.

03:28:04
<transcript>: And what are we going to do in here? We're going to say.

03:28:10
<transcript>: This is for each row. We're going to run this thing. We're going to say, row.

03:28:11
jmejam: This syntax is a lot different to what I am used to, looks kinda like Python (sorry Elixir devs)

03:28:12
<transcript>: Row.

03:28:21
<transcript>: Phenom map. No row is actually an object. Oh, I got to pass the keys in.

03:28:24
pot0fgreeed: @mecoupz you ok there buddy?

mecoupz: yeah i'm fine and u?

03:28:53
<transcript>: Keys to scrub is not actually keys to scrub anymore.

03:28:58
<transcript>: It's keys row and then function key accumulator.

03:28:58
<transcript>: so map

03:29:03
<transcript>: So map git. Yes. Okay. This is right so far.

03:29:03
<transcript>: we get

03:29:11
<transcript>: We get the key the value from the key, but the value is a new map that we need to call scrub on.

03:29:13
<transcript>: Okay.

03:29:13
<transcript>: the value

03:29:16
<transcript>: The value is a map.

03:29:21
<transcript>: I don't need to do a case on it. I just need to say value equals map.

03:29:21
<transcript>: get

03:29:22
neochromer: talking an average 200 viewers per day in the last 30 days, thats about 12k macbook requests

<transcript>: I'm so lost in Inception right now. So update row calls all those things right now. I don't have any keys to scrub in there. This is all nonsense. That's what copilot said. And it's going to just be row.

03:35:08

03:39:32
<transcript>: Suspiciously takes in grids.

03:39:35
<transcript>: What is going on.

03:39:38
<transcript>: Updating grids update, grid.

03:39:42
<transcript>: We pass in an array of grids.

03:39:45
<transcript>: Okay.

03:39:56
<transcript>: So hasn't gotten it. Rows and rows aren't the same thing. What are you talking about.

03:40:02
<transcript>: This wife? 100% poisoning him. Where did I do? Rose, guys, where did I do that.

03:40:02
mecoupz: @thdxr you need to contact his wife and she needs to help us trolling him

03:40:03
laytanl_: `:rows` and "rows" are the same thing 󠀀

03:40:05
<transcript>: Oh, I'm doing it right there.

03:40:10
<transcript>: That's not me. That's somebody else did that. What are you talking about.

03:40:16

03:40:21
thdxr: maps can have string keys or atom keys

03:40:23
<transcript>: Dax is telling the truth. Okay.

03:40:25
thdxr: so they're not interchangable

03:40:26
teej_dv: only listen to dax

03:40:28
<transcript>: They're not the same thing. I get it, guys. I get it.

03:40:43
<transcript>: I'm not using the one. Maps can have string keys or atom keys, so they're not interchangeable. Only listen to X. Okay, but it's not applicable. That's why I feel like you're trolling me right now because I'm not actually using one or the other. Well, I'm using Map git, but I think that's fine.

03:40:45
<transcript>: Right.

03:40:48
<transcript>: I think.

03:40:50
laytanl_: @teej_dv Not the best advice when it comes to dax I think

03:40:52
<transcript>: I can use map git. I just got to figure out how to untangle all this code.

03:40:52
<transcript>: update

03:40:54
<transcript>: Update grid.

03:40:54
<transcript>: i don't know why

03:40:58
gitpush_gitpaid: @thdxr off topic but i saw my twitter page yesterday and noticed it was filled with your miami vice pics. if i had followers/visitors theyd probably wonder wtf is going on

03:41:05
<transcript>: I don't know why it's called Update Grid. Now when it operates on multiple grids, I guess it's like each grid enum map, update rows. It passes in.

03:41:08
<transcript>: The grid and the count.

03:41:09
thdxr: ok I was confirming because you wrote `:rows` first and then wrote "rows" and it sounded like it was a stylistic reason

03:41:13
<transcript>: Here we go. And then we get the keys from the grid.

03:41:19
<transcript>: And then we go updated rows equals map get. I don't know why it's not formatting this.

03:41:23
thdxr: @gitpush_gitpaid yeah LOL

03:41:26
<transcript>: We get.

03:41:27
<transcript>: Rows.

03:41:34
<transcript>: Oh, yeah? I wrote Rose first and then wrote Rose, and it sounded like it was a stylistic reason. Yeah, I thought it was.

03:41:34
<transcript>: i thought

03:41:42

03:45:51
gitpush_gitpaid: can confirm. not in algeria.

03:46:01
<transcript>: You can probably find a Mode 80 on the internet on ebay or something. They don't make them anymore so you can't buy it even if you could buy a Mode 80.

03:46:01
<transcript>: this mode

03:46:21
<transcript>: This mode 80 they built for me. So mode actually built the keyboard. They lubed the stabs and the switches and everything, and they send it to me. Made. All I had to do is put my gmk dracula keycaps on it so you can't get this exact keyboard. I don't know if you buy one and you buy all the components off ebay or something and you put it together if it'll sound as good.

03:46:21
<transcript>: because

03:46:30
<transcript>: Because they did it. They did it. I'm not good at lubing. I'm terrible at it, actually. But this keyboard sounds fantastic, because they're very good at it.

03:46:38
<transcript>: Can confirm not in algeria. Okay. So if you're not in algeria, maybe we don't need to know, because that would be a lot of people just saying.

03:47:01
<transcript>: i'm in love

03:47:03
<transcript>: I'm in love with this keyboard.

03:47:06
laytanl_: I am not in Africa

03:47:08
ocelot2123: half of my keys sound different from the other half LUL

03:47:08
binajmen: why are those DIY? can't you buy them already mounted?

03:47:09
<transcript>: I have four other keyboards. I just don't use them because this one just sounds too good. I can't use anything else.

03:47:11
gitpush_gitpaid: what a flex. a company built a keyboard for you. meanwhile im here arguing with amazon that my keyboards arent as described Kappa

03:47:11
laytanl_: I am not in America

03:47:20
<transcript>: I use a filco Magic Touch. Magic Touch would recommend if anyone wants a no thrills, solid mechanical keyboard, use them for years.

03:47:24
<transcript>: Layton, not Nigeria, not in Africa. Good to know.

03:47:35
<transcript>: Half my key sound different from the other half. Yeah. When I lose my own keyboards, there's a lot of, like clinging sounds because I don't do enough lube on the stabs.

03:47:35
<transcript>: or like yeah

03:47:43
<transcript>: Or like, yeah, they're very inconsistent, just like the process. I would love to actually do it on stream because you guys could just laugh at me and how terrible.

03:47:43
<transcript>: and uneven all

03:47:48
<transcript>: And uneven. All the lube is it's just globbed all over the place. I'm so bad at it.

03:47:53
<transcript>: Why are those diy? Can't you buy them already mounted.

03:47:58
<transcript>: You talking about mode keyboards? Mode keyboards are all DIY.

03:48:02
<transcript>: You just buy the components and you put it together yourself.

03:48:02
<transcript>: but

03:48:03
<transcript>: But.

03:48:10
daglee: I'm not outside of Adams window staring at him. Yet.

03:48:23
<transcript>: They reached out to me, so I think the next message get pushed. What a flex company built a keyboard for you. Meanwhile, I'm here arguing with Amazon. Mckeebot is subscribed Layton also, not in America. Good to know. So they reached out to me. Somebody at mowed who's just a big keyboard nerd, had seen my office like a picture of my office on, like a newsletter that does workspaces or whatever they show.

03:48:23
<transcript>: showcase

03:48:28
<transcript>: Showcase workspaces and saw My office.

03:48:28
<transcript>: and reach

03:48:30
<transcript>: And reached out and said, Hey.

03:48:37
<transcript>: We'd like you to use one of our keyboards because we think it'd look really good with your setup.

03:48:37
<transcript>: i said

03:48:49
<transcript>: I said, okay, I didn't know anything about mechanical keyboards. It didn't really care. I was like, sure, sounds fun. And they sent me this keyboard. Little did I know is like, this perfect in game keyboard that I will never find a better keyboard.

03:48:49
<transcript>: or at least

03:48:53
<transcript>: Or at least not for me. This one is just I can't imagine wanting anything else.

03:48:57
ocelot2123: I ordered a QK75 from qwerty and its coming soon, I'm excited

03:49:02
<transcript>: And then subsequently. Now I have six mode keyboards, five that I've built, or five that are built, one that I haven't built yet, which I'll do on stream at some point.

03:49:02
<transcript>: anyway

03:49:04
<transcript>: Anyway.

03:49:10
<transcript>: I'm not outside of adam's window staring at him yet that was scary. Dagly.

03:49:10
<transcript>: okay

03:49:11
<transcript>: Okay.

03:49:11
<transcript>: let's

03:49:15
<transcript>: Let's finish this. I got to finish this code. Because this drive me crazy.

03:49:21
<transcript>: I can't rest until it's done.

03:49:27
<transcript>: I mean I can't rest anymore. I guess I just did.

03:49:29
coolpantstv: @daglee you should hurry up and get here, the view is great

03:49:38
<transcript>: Okay.

03:49:42
jmejam: I spend a fair bit on keyboards, meanwhile I spend a lot of time on my MBP as I travel a fair bit for work, conferences and such

03:49:42
<transcript>: Let's get serious. How are we doing this.

03:49:45
<transcript>: Updated rows.

03:49:46
jmejam: Bit silly really. LUL

03:49:55
<transcript>: What's all this stuff.

03:50:04
<transcript>: Is there like one issue and it's percolating.

03:50:05
<transcript>: That word.

03:50:05
<transcript>: percolate

03:50:07
<transcript>: Percolateing no.

03:50:07
<transcript>: what

03:50:09
<transcript>: What's the word.

03:50:09
<transcript>: oh

03:50:14
<transcript>: Oh, thank you so much for the prime sub top. Thank you so much.

03:50:15
borchborchtwitch: you smoke

03:50:23
<transcript>: I really do appreciate prime subs. A little extra on prime subs is because you only get one of them. You smoke.

03:50:25
<transcript>: Percolate.

03:50:29
<transcript>: I don't smoke. What.

03:50:32
<transcript>: There was problem here variable value.

03:50:32
<transcript>: is

03:50:37
<transcript>: Is unused? Oh, I didn't even use value? Oh, Jeez.

03:50:40
<transcript>: So the value of the map.

03:50:44
<transcript>: The value.

03:50:46
daglee: Smoke what? Fish, yes.

03:50:49
<transcript>: I believe this right here should be value.

03:50:55
<transcript>: Yeah, we're scrubbing.

03:50:57
<transcript>: Wait. Yes.

03:50:59
<transcript>: Okay.

03:50:59
<transcript>: that's correct

03:51:00
<transcript>: That's correct.

03:51:05
<transcript>: Map three is undefined. Is map map actually a function.

03:51:08
<transcript>: Is it not.

03:51:11
<transcript>: Did I make a mistake here.

03:51:11
<transcript>: do i need en

03:51:14
<transcript>: Do I need enum map? No.

03:51:19
<transcript>: Is this just update in. Maybe it's just update in.

03:51:23
nexxeln: you can Enum.map on a map iirc

03:51:34
<transcript>: Is this just update in. Let's see, what do we do in here? Map. Get map, put, map out. Put that's what we want. Map. Put.

03:51:39
<transcript>: That's what I want. Okay, so scrub rows should be good. Now.

03:51:45
<transcript>: You can enum map on a map if I recall correctly. Yeah, we're doing that. I think up here.

03:51:50
<transcript>: But this should be good now call to missing or unexpected.

03:51:55
<transcript>: I should be good at it it's just not updated yet. List code base is huge.

03:52:00
<transcript>: Okay, it's updated. Scrub row is good.

03:52:06
<transcript>: Scrub row, does what I want.

03:52:06
<transcript>: now the

03:52:07
<transcript>: Now the question is.

03:52:19
<transcript>: It is funny. Like I'm enjoying this process of getting reacquainted with functional programming and elixir. But I could have written this whole thing.

03:52:19
<transcript>: in like

03:52:24
<transcript>: In, like, 30 seconds in typescript. And it's just kind of annoying.

03:52:27
<transcript>: On nightly. Thanks so much for the follow.

03:52:31
devagrawal09: fucking love this song

03:52:34
<transcript>: Like at the end of the day. I don't think I could ever choose to do this all the time just for pragmatism's sake.

03:52:34
<transcript>: you love this

03:52:37
<transcript>: You love this song dev. Me too I got.

03:52:37

03:52:54
borchborchtwitch: I love queen

03:52:54
<transcript>: Okay.

03:53:00
<transcript>: So you hated the movie but you love Queen. That's probably the real base take.

03:53:02
nexxeln: but i don't like the music LUL

03:53:02
devagrawal09: i was not a big queen fan before that movie

03:53:03

03:53:06
gitpush_gitpaid: the one with mr. robot? was an ok movie

03:53:06
<transcript>: I wasn't a Queen fan before the movie. Now I'm a Queen fan. So that's probably like.

03:53:11
<transcript>: Annoying to people. It's like when you've read the book and you're like the book is so much better.

03:53:13
lithiumx4900: I grew up listening to Queen

03:53:14
<transcript>: I don't know. It was a good movie.

03:53:59
<transcript>: Update in Where am I doing update in.

lithiumx4900: @devagrawal09 Rami Malek did a decent job. The movie was just not hitting it with me.

03:55:01
2dorkstv: mr. robot was pretty great

03:55:02
<transcript>: So Mr. Robot is a movie.

03:55:03
monsef_ot: it is amazing

03:55:08

03:55:19
<transcript>: Just the right syntax for I just want to return updated rows. Oh, wait, I'll just do map put.

03:55:26
<transcript>: too

03:55:27
gitpush_gitpaid: last season of mr robot was weak as hell

03:55:28
<transcript>: Too easy.

03:55:28
jackdead: Hey, hello! Man, can you give some developers website portfolio? I'm looking for inspirations to create mine

03:55:33
w1tuuu: The actor who did Freddie Mercury is the same who did the main character of Mr Robot (series)

03:55:33
<transcript>: Can anybody find me.

03:55:33
<transcript>: why

03:55:35
2dorkstv: it actually had some decent computer use in it. Not as hand wavy as some shows/movies

03:55:41
<transcript>: Why was I doing it the other way? Why was I ever doing that weird update in syntax? If I could just do that.

03:55:44
goodgrandpaa: Good morning!

<transcript>: I see him do this all the time. And this one's awesome.

03:56:20
adamdotdev: https://mikematas.com/

03:56:22
<transcript>: I wouldn't recommend just copying this because it's very unique.

03:56:22
<transcript>: but

03:56:24
<transcript>: But how cool is this.

03:56:24
<transcript>: it goes back

03:56:28
<transcript>: that's just

<transcript>: Pretty cool.

03:56:38
<transcript>: That's a way to do a portfolio.

03:56:38
<transcript>: it's infinite

03:56:41
<transcript>: It's infinite possibilities when it comes to portfolios.

03:56:41
monsef_ot: simply it is about a psychopath hacker who wants to get one of the biggest company in the world down

03:56:46
<transcript>: You really can do anything. Let's test our code. Let's test it. I was right here.

03:56:50
<transcript>: Against the Sun.

03:56:50
<transcript>: now

03:56:52
<transcript>: Now it should be scrubbing.

03:56:54
borchborchtwitch: hey adam when i code with chatgpt i use these prompts: that produced this error, please send the fixed code in a code box:  please incorporate that into the current program and put the fixed code in a code box:  that produced the same error, please send the fixed code in a code box:  please provide the fixed code in a code box:  please finish and put it in a code box:

03:56:54
monsef_ot: a TV show of 6 seasons

03:56:56
jackdead: i'll not copy lol, just looking for some vibes inspirations

03:56:56
<transcript>: All the after the first five rows.

03:56:58
<transcript>: It should be scrubbing.

03:57:00
<transcript>: We broke things.

03:57:02
<transcript>: Broke things.

03:57:02
<transcript>: they broke

03:57:04
<transcript>: They broke.

03:57:11

03:57:15
ozcap123: I just updated my portfolio https://oscars.dev

03:57:16
<transcript>: I don't understand.

03:57:17
jackdead: i love the way that the ionic website is made

03:57:23
jackdead: @ozcap123 thanks mate

03:57:29
<transcript>: Let me just look at the code and see if I can figure it out. That's my problem with debugging in this elixir app is like, mostly it's just looking at the code harder and being like, oh, would something in here work or no, I miss my typescript.

03:57:35
<transcript>: Not copy just looking for some vibes inspirations? Yeah anybody know.

03:57:40
<transcript>: Are there good collections of dev portfolios for inspiration.

03:57:47
gitpush_gitpaid: speaking of musician movies or what ever theyre called... the motley crue movie was pretty ok too

03:57:51
<transcript>: Simply, is it about a sacrifice hacker who wants to get one of the biggest company in the world down. That's what Mr. Robot is. What next? Jamie, thank you for the follow. I appreciate that. Follow.

03:57:55
devagrawal09: once i rewrite mine in astro yeah

03:58:01
jackdead: nice keyboard tho

03:58:08
<transcript>: I hate Adam when I code a Chad gbt, I use these prompts that produces error. Please send the fixed code in a code box. Please incorporate that into the current program and put the fixed code in a code box that produces the same error. Please send the fixed code in a code box. Please provide the fixed code in a code box. Please finish and put it in a code box.

03:58:15
adjectiveallison: https://dribbble.com/ ^ That can inspire all sorts of directions

03:58:16
<transcript>: I see. Borgeborge, you're saying I should just take all the code and put in a code box, or put it in Chat gbt and tell it to put it in a code box.

03:58:22
laytanl_: Please code box

03:58:25
laytanl_: please robot

03:58:36
<transcript>: Let's see. I love the way that the ionic website is made. Speaking of musician movies or whatever they're called the Motley Crew movie was pretty. Okay, too. Pretty. Okay. Quite an endorsement there, turk. Once I rewrite mine and astro. Yeah. Look at Des once he rewrites it. Thank you.

03:58:41
<transcript>: Nice keyboard though.

03:58:44
<transcript>: Okay.

03:58:50
borchborchtwitch: if you dont specify code box it has a chance of sending code as text

03:58:55
<transcript>: So I need to figure this out. Please. Code box please robots thank you for follow ntx so update grids.

03:58:55
<transcript>: update

03:58:57
<transcript>: Update grid.

03:58:57
<transcript>: this is such

03:59:04
mecoupz: alright i have to go. have a nice stream adam

03:59:05
<transcript>: This is such a mess. Let's see if we're getting here. I o puts keys see if we're getting this far.

03:59:06
gitpush_gitpaid: i am quite hard to please. that says a lot about you and dax's content/streams. top quality

03:59:06
nexxeln: feel free to take inspiration

03:59:09
<transcript>: Actually, I need to go back.

03:59:13
<transcript>: Okay.

03:59:16

<transcript>: did it

03:59:31
nexxeln: tyty

03:59:35

03:59:35
goodgrandpaa: np!!

03:59:38
<transcript>: That's good.

03:59:43
jackdead: @ozcap123 i love the marquee tag at the bottom :)

03:59:48
<transcript>: i'm just

04:00:01
<transcript>: I'm just so used to getting trolled today. I did not expect the kind message. Thank you so much. That means a lot. If you don't specify codebox, it has a chance of sending code as text. A lot of people use my design as well. Nextl. All right. I have to go see them. The coupes.

04:00:01
<transcript>: we're just going to

04:00:05
<transcript>: We're just going to be another 20 minutes. So you're not missing much.

04:00:13
<transcript>: Adam, have you contemplated the point of human existence yet today? No. Allison, actually, today has been free of all of that.

04:00:17
<transcript>: Just head down getting some stuff written.

04:00:17
<transcript>: we'll leave the

04:00:20
<transcript>: We'll leave the existential dread for tomorrow.

04:00:23
<transcript>: Okay.

04:00:25
ozcap123: @jackdead Thanks! Just wanted to build something that was fun to make

04:00:34
<transcript>: If we make it this far, that's something updated. Let's try doing this. I. O. Puts updated rows.

04:00:37
<transcript>: Maybe.

04:00:41
goodgrandpaa: @adamdotdev Did your company use data scraping to get the data for the queries or go api route, and what contributed to making the decision you did?

04:00:43
<transcript>: Most points against the Bulls.

04:00:50
laytanl_: !data

04:00:59
<transcript>: Good. Grandpa, did your company use data scraping to get the data for the queries or Go api route and what contributed making decisions you did. Oh, there you go, layton's. On top of it. I have a data command. I was getting ready to type it. Good, grandpa. This question comes up a lot.

04:00:59
borchborchtwitch: GPT is easy I bet it can take your whole file and fix it for you if you arent sending the whole file

04:01:03
<transcript>: So I've got a little command for it.

04:01:11
<transcript>: Okay. Errors were raised. Did it actually dump that? No, it didn't. It didn't get that far. So that's where the error is. I know that much, right.

04:01:18
goodgrandpaa: @laytanl_ Thank you!

04:01:19
<transcript>: Or at least it can't output it. It can't write it so that could be the problem.

04:01:24
<transcript>: Map Output grid. Rows. Updated rows.

04:01:24
<transcript>: let's try

04:01:27
<transcript>: Let's try the update in syntax.

04:01:27
<transcript>: as much as i

04:01:30
<transcript>: As much as I don't understand why these things are different.

04:01:30
<transcript>: let's try not

04:01:33
neochromer: Dont be mad Adam, but I'm wathcing you in Picture in Picture mode..

04:01:33
<transcript>: Let's try not using map put.

04:01:37
<transcript>: Let's say.

04:01:37
<transcript>: grid

04:01:37
adjectiveallison: xD good to hear and glad you've had a productive morning :)

04:01:37
neochromer: its not that you dont deserve a monitor

04:01:39
<transcript>: Grid update in.

04:01:39
<transcript>: row

04:01:41
<transcript>: Rows.

04:01:42
neochromer: but I need my 3 monitors

04:01:46
<transcript>: Update details. Okay. So this is where.

04:01:47
<transcript>: It needs to be.

04:01:50
<transcript>: Just.

04:01:52
<transcript>: How do I do.

04:01:52
<transcript>: a function

04:01:53
<transcript>: A function.

04:01:55
<transcript>: Fun function.

04:02:01
<transcript>: Doesn't matter what they pass and then I just want to do updated rows.

04:02:03
<transcript>: What's wrong with that.

04:02:06
<transcript>: Can I do it that way.

04:02:11
<transcript>: So update, rows.

04:02:11
<transcript>: and just set it

04:02:15
<transcript>: And just set it to updated rows. Is it going to complain.

04:02:15
<transcript>: wait

04:02:24
<transcript>: Waiting, waiting. Maybe we'll just go and test because the lsp takes so long. I think it's better just to do a test. Most blocks in a game against.

04:02:24
<transcript>: the

04:02:25
<transcript>: The.

04:02:25
<transcript>: hawks

04:02:27
<transcript>: Hawks.

04:02:29
<transcript>: I saw food.

04:02:29
<transcript>: still

04:02:32
<transcript>: Still have food.

04:02:37
<transcript>: It might work.

04:02:40
<transcript>: No.

04:02:42
<transcript>: Didn't work.

04:02:46
<transcript>: Never lucky.

04:02:46
<transcript>: json

04:02:48
kylliangamer: hey adam

04:02:52
<transcript>: Json. Jason encoder not implemented for display of type tuple. Okay.

04:02:57
<transcript>: Kind of see where this is happening.

04:02:57
<transcript>: review

04:02:58
laytanl_: I thought php lsp's were bad but man

04:02:59
<transcript>: Review Show visual.

04:03:05
<transcript>: I know what the problem is.

04:03:10
<transcript>: I'm scrubbing stuff that is a different shape.

04:03:18
jackdead: i'll name my son Json or JQuery, for sure

04:03:19
<transcript>: So I'm scrubbing display and setting it's a string. Oh, no, I'm not scrubbing anything. I did. Empty. Oh.

04:03:23
<transcript>: I didn't actually do these yet, so I needed to display.

04:03:28
<transcript>: I left that empty, didn't I.

04:03:30
<transcript>: Yeah? This needs to be.

04:03:34
<transcript>: Maybe.

04:03:38
<transcript>: This is so complicated.

04:03:39
laytanl_: Jason is a valid name tbh

04:03:39
neochromer: @adamdotdev, is there a reason you cant rewrite it in something else?

04:03:42
<transcript>: So kind.

04:03:42
neochromer: too much logic?

04:03:43
<transcript>: Of.

04:03:47
<transcript>: Neocrumer. We are rewriting it in something else.

04:03:47
<transcript>: i'm rewriting

04:03:50
<transcript>: I'm rewriting this whole elixir app.

04:03:50
<transcript>: in as

04:03:52
<transcript>: In astro, in typescript.

04:04:02
<transcript>: But we're trying to get this feature done this month, and the rewrite is going to take too long. So we're just building this into the existing app.

04:04:06
<transcript>: And then we'll go from there.

04:04:06
<transcript>: so this

04:04:07
kylliangamer: @jackdead if your name is jack, then why not name him "jackson" it's both an actual name and it basically says "jack's son" lmao

04:04:10
neochromer: aaha okay

04:04:13
<transcript>: So this is the last thing we're doing in this elixir app. Unfortunately still doing it. What happened? Did it actually run.

04:04:17
<transcript>: Did it actually run.

04:04:24
neochromer: Is it a secret from where you get the data ?

04:04:24
<transcript>: So it's the display key. That it's saying it can't what.

04:04:24
<transcript>: updated

04:04:26
neochromer: external API

04:04:29
neochromer: or something else?

04:04:29
<transcript>: Updated Rows, Map git, rows.

04:04:33
<transcript>: Is it a secret from where you get the data.

04:04:34
adamdotdev: !data

04:04:34

04:04:38
<transcript>: That's funny. Someone just asked that there's the answer.

04:04:44
<transcript>: Killian's. Here. What's going on? Killian.

04:04:46
goodgrandpaa: LUL @NeoChromer Have a project coming up?

04:04:49
<transcript>: Welcome.

04:04:52
neochromer: Had a job Interview at SportRadar hah

04:04:57
<transcript>: Gpt is easy. I bet it can take your whole file and fix it for you if you aren't sending the whole file.

04:04:57
<transcript>: yeah i

04:04:59
neochromer: @GoodGrandPaa, maybe..

04:05:02
<transcript>: Yeah. I guess maybe it could. I just don't know if I can describe in words what I want it to do.

04:05:09
<transcript>: Don't be mad at them, but I'm watching you picture in picture mode. What's that mean? That's okay. I'm okay with that.

04:05:13
<transcript>: And glad I've had a productive morning. Thank you, allison. It's been productive.

04:05:13
<transcript>: i'm on

04:05:15
<transcript>: I'm on like a timeline. Here.

04:05:15
<transcript>: there are

04:05:20
<transcript>: There are reasons why I want to get this done quickly.

04:05:24
<transcript>: Antioxidant. I see that thank you for the follow ntx. I don't know if I saw it.

04:05:26
jackdead: @KyllianGamer nice tip, but my real name is not Jack :(... It's my game name lol

04:05:27
goodgrandpaa: I'm thinking of a project, but I'm not sure which route I should take, data scrape or api myself. @NeoChromer

04:05:32
borchborchtwitch: you can just type out literally everything or do it bit by bit and combine

04:05:33
<transcript>: You'll name your son Jason or jquery, for sure. That's funny. I thought PSPL were bad. Man. This one is slow because.

04:05:33
<transcript>: it's a big old project

04:05:34
<transcript>: It's a big old project.

04:05:34
<transcript>: just

04:05:41
<transcript>: Just a lot of licks are in here. I can't believe how much code there is in this repo actually.

04:05:42
borchborchtwitch: I have it do object oriented

04:05:45
ocelot2123: "done quickly" and "doing it on stream" seems like a oxymoron

04:05:50
<transcript>: So.

04:05:54
neochromer: @GoodGrandPaa, Isn't data scrape kinda a gray area?

04:05:55
<transcript>: You had a job in interview at Sport Radar. That's crazy.

04:06:04
<transcript>: Oh, Jack, is not your real name.

04:06:08
goodgrandpaa: @NeoChromer I've no clue, that's actually why I'm asking about it :)

04:06:11
<transcript>: I'm just trying to distract myself because I hate this. I hate this. Trying to troubleshoot an elixir. I'm just having such a hard time.

04:06:13
<transcript>: Updated rose.

04:06:15
<transcript>: We have a grid.

04:06:15
<transcript>: we get

04:06:19
<transcript>: We get the keys successfully. Now I'm trying to get the rows.

04:06:27
<transcript>: And then map each row and call scrub Row on it.

04:06:27
<transcript>: which calls

04:06:29
<transcript>: Which calls reduce.

04:06:34
<transcript>: On the keys.

04:06:40
<transcript>: Value. It gets the value and then it does. Map put.

04:06:43
neochromer: I would recommend doing just over a API

04:06:44
goodgrandpaa: @NeoChromer I would only do it if it's public data that's already accessible to the general user.

04:06:45
<transcript>: Maybe I shouldn't be doing map put here. Is that the problem.

04:06:45
neochromer: its easier to learn

04:06:48
<transcript>: Let's try this.

04:06:51
<transcript>: Try this.

04:06:51
<transcript>: what are we going to

04:06:53
kylliangamer: @adamdotdev did I tell you yet that I now know what I'm going to be studying next year? if not: imma be going to uni and study engineering

04:06:54
<transcript>: What are we going to do? A pipe. We'll just say.

04:06:57
<transcript>: Update in.

04:06:58
goodgrandpaa: @NeoChromer I was thinking that would be the case as well, easier to learn I bet for sure.

04:06:59
<transcript>: Act.

04:07:04
<transcript>: And then the function.

04:07:09
<transcript>: No. Then the key.

04:07:12
<transcript>: Key and then the function.

04:07:16
<transcript>: Rub.

04:07:19
<transcript>: I don't need to do it like this. Yeah.

04:07:23
<transcript>: Scrub last in.

04:07:25
<transcript>: A value is going to be.

04:07:25
<transcript>: value

04:07:27
<transcript>: Value.

04:07:29
<transcript>: Count.

04:07:33
<transcript>: Keys.

04:07:37
<transcript>: To scrub, I guess. Why did I do the.

04:07:40
<transcript>: Let's try that.

04:07:40
<transcript>: maybe

04:07:46
<transcript>: Maybe map put was a problem. Oh no. Doesn't like it Invalid. Orgs.

04:07:53
<transcript>: Supposed to pass it data keys, and then a function. I passed it data keys.

04:07:53
<transcript>: and

04:07:55
<transcript>: And then a function.

04:07:59
<transcript>: Right.

04:08:03
<transcript>: What's wrong? Why can't I do that.

04:08:08
<transcript>: Scrub last in. Not a function. Yeah, it's a function.

04:08:11
<transcript>: Oh, man.

04:08:11
<transcript>: killian

04:08:14
<transcript>: Killian? Did I tell you that.

04:08:15
goodgrandpaa: @NeoChromer None of the data would be personal either if I had went that route. It would be public info, not any identifiable info.

04:08:24
<transcript>: I now know what I'm going to be studying next year. If not, I'm going to be going to uni and study engineering. What kind of engineering? That's so exciting. Killian. What kind.

04:08:27
<transcript>: What kind of engineering.

04:08:34
<transcript>: This is a bummer.

04:08:36
<transcript>: Got a little stuck here.

04:08:39
kylliangamer: uh I believe the translation would be "civil engineering" but not too sure

04:09:01
<transcript>: Wait a minute.

04:09:07
daglee: Well, engineering is civil by default. Military engineers isn't that common.

04:09:08
greetten: @KyllianGamer congrats

04:09:10
<transcript>: It'll pass the value. I don't need to do value like that.

04:09:10
msmazaya: Hi adam, I love your camera quality, what camera/setup are you using?

04:09:14
<transcript>: It'll do like this.

04:09:16
<transcript>: Right.

04:09:18
<transcript>: Pass the value in like the.

04:09:26
<transcript>: Aha.

04:09:29
<transcript>: Let's see if this works.

04:09:35
<transcript>: Like Chad, gbt has led me down some paths that were not great today.

04:09:35
<transcript>: most points in

04:09:37
<transcript>: Most points in.

04:09:37
<transcript>: a game

04:09:39
laytanl_: @msmazaya Sony a7S III and a Sony a7 IV

04:09:39
<transcript>: A Game against the Lakers.

04:09:46
msmazaya: Thanks!

04:09:48
adamdotdev: !camera

04:09:48
fossabot: Adam uses two main cameras, a Sony A7S III with a Sony FE 35mm F1.8 Lens which sits behind a teleprompter and serves as the wide angle shot of the office. As well as a Sony A7 IV with a Sony FE 50mm F1.2 GM which is used for the green screen camera whilst Adam is sharing his screen.

04:09:48
<transcript>: Ms. Messiah. Hi, Adam. I love your camera quality. What camera setup are you using? Welcome to Chat, Ms. Mosaya.

04:09:51
<transcript>: There you go.

04:09:51
<transcript>: there's all

04:09:52
<transcript>: There's all my stuff.

04:09:56
iannery: @daglee I believe civil in that free translation is more focused on buildings and stuff rather than mechanical/electrical/computer engineering

04:09:57
<transcript>: Something like that.

04:10:03
<transcript>: I believe civil in that free.

04:10:03
<transcript>: translation

04:10:06
<transcript>: Translation is more focused a bit. Oh, you. Did you answer my question.

04:10:06
<transcript>: well engineer

04:10:10
<transcript>: Well, engineering is civil. I believe translation would be civil. Engineering.

04:10:10
<transcript>: like

04:10:12
<transcript>: Like bridges and stuff.

04:10:15
<transcript>: Infrastructure.

04:10:19
<transcript>: That's cool killian. I'm so excited for you.

04:10:19
<transcript>: i remember

04:10:25
<transcript>: I remember when I first decided, like I'm going to do computer science. And I felt so good just having a direction in life.

04:10:25
<transcript>: like i

04:10:28
<transcript>: Like I'm studying something and.

04:10:28
<transcript>: there's

04:10:32
<transcript>: There's potentially purpose behind that it worked out.

04:10:40
<transcript>: So what am I doing here? I'm running into prompts. I think now I'm just like, I'm still hitting the same issue.

04:10:43
<transcript>: Jason encoder.

04:10:47
<transcript>: Not implemented for display.

04:10:47
<transcript>: and then

04:10:49
<transcript>: And then that.

04:10:54
<transcript>: Let's look at something.

04:10:58
<transcript>: Jason.

04:10:58
<transcript>: display

04:11:00
<transcript>: Display string.

04:11:12
<transcript>: Oh, wait, it could be this display inside of here entity is a map.

04:11:13
greetten: I think you can call it master of science

04:11:13
samhuckaby: @KyllianGamer the little I know about civil engineering is insanely interesting. You're going to have so much fun with that.

04:11:17
<transcript>: That should be fine though it should just pass it through.

04:11:25
<transcript>: My brain struggling.

04:11:33
<transcript>: So it's something I'm trying to pass down? It's something.

04:11:33
<transcript>: i'm trying

04:11:35
reddycat333: i’m a graduating high school this year and planning on majoring in computer science too! kinda scared tho

04:11:35
<transcript>: I'm trying to.

04:11:39
<transcript>: Do this.

04:11:50
<transcript>: Ready, Cat. Welcome to Chat. You're going to do computer science. I'm excited for you as well. Don't be scared. You can always change your mind.

04:11:50
<transcript>: and

04:11:52
<transcript>: And you might just love it.

04:11:52
<transcript>: might lead

04:11:56
<transcript>: Might lead to a very great career. The thing about.

04:11:59
<transcript>: This computer science.

04:12:02
<transcript>: Is that what I want to do? Answer.

04:12:02
<transcript>: the thing about

04:12:05
<transcript>: The thing about computer science is.

04:12:15
the_gruntler: Can you look at the types JasonEncoder supports? Maybe there's a clue there to how you're trying to use the encoder

04:12:17
<transcript>: We're just getting a job as a programmer. You get paid like a doctor, but you don't have to go to school near as long. And you don't have to deal with a lot of things that are negative that doctors have to deal with.

04:12:24
goodgrandpaa: Unless you're me :P

04:12:25
thechosenone1080: finally early enough to catch adam still streaming

04:12:26
<transcript>: Okay, here we go. Well, I should say you get paid like a doctor in the US. Most points in a game against.

04:12:26
kylliangamer: it's not "bridges and stuff" it's more generic the first 2 years; after that you choose an actual "field" or whatever you want to call that

04:12:28
<transcript>: The box.

04:12:28
<transcript>: can you

04:12:38
<transcript>: Can you look at the types json encoder supports? Maybe there's a clue there to how you're trying to use the encoder. So the ground layer. First of all, welcome to chat.

04:12:40
ocelot2123: @reddycat333 nothing to be scared of! my advice would be to try to do as many internships as you can since school may not be a good indication on if you like the job or not

04:12:40
<transcript>: Yeah. Maybe.

04:12:40
<transcript>: i

04:12:42
<transcript>: I think.

04:12:47
<transcript>: What I want to see is what data I'm trying to send over the wire and.

04:12:49
goodgrandpaa: If you're me, you make less than half a doctor haha.

04:12:56
<transcript>: I can't so strings string care is not implemented so I can't two string this thing I guess can I use logger.

04:13:03
kylliangamer: but idk in dutch it's called "burgerlijke ingenieurswetenschappen" but the first year is mainly math and generic stuff from what I have been told

04:13:05
<transcript>: Can I use logger? Oh, this might give me enough. Here, let's see. Namelines. Okay, so this is the chart.

04:13:05
<transcript>: isn't it

04:13:07
<transcript>: Isn't it? Visual? Additional questions.

04:13:08
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: cardio surgeons get paid 1m+ in US so big doubt on hat

04:13:10
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: that

04:13:11
<transcript>: Where is the chart.

04:13:14
monsef_ot: You know, I haven't been accepted to any computer science program at university, I tried but they also tried to not accept me, so I accepted the challenge and I learned it my self , Now I am a Co-Founder of a great Marketing Agency

04:13:25
<transcript>: Detail. Column charts. Here we go. Column charts, categories, namelines. Okay. And then we eventually empty out name lines. That's good. And then the next thing is.

04:13:29
<transcript>: Whoa, this is a problem.

04:13:29
<transcript>: this

04:13:31
<transcript>: This is a problem.

04:13:31
<transcript>: so

04:13:35
<transcript>: So that was categories. Next thing is name.

04:13:35
<transcript>: points

04:13:37
<transcript>: Points series.

04:13:42
<transcript>: Hang on.

04:13:45
<transcript>: All right.

04:13:45
<transcript>: i may have

04:13:48
<transcript>: I may have broken the structure here. Name.

04:13:53
<transcript>: Series oh, where.

04:13:53
<transcript>: i'm looking at

04:13:57
<transcript>: I'm looking at grids. I should be looking at charts.

04:14:01
<transcript>: Column, charts.

04:14:05
<transcript>: I didn't break column charts. I haven't changed those. That's fine.

04:14:13
<transcript>: Name series. Yeah, that's fine. I want to look at the table data, but it's truncated. Oh, it's truncated. I need more.

04:14:13
<transcript>: i need more

04:14:15
<transcript>: I need more, Sir.

04:14:18
<transcript>: Bummer not like this.

04:14:23
<transcript>: Pyro. Riz thank you for the follow. Thank you so much for that follow.

04:14:32
<transcript>: Is dax streaming yet? Because I'm going to be ending soon. And if he's not, he needs to be so I can raid him. I guess I could raid someone else if he's not streaming.

04:14:32
goodgrandpaa: He is!

04:14:35
<transcript>: But.

04:14:38
joey_day: Time to stand, I think I saw on your watch. LUL

04:14:46
greetten: im in my 2nd semester of computer science right now i've just hit a "wall" where everything feels so overwhelming

04:14:47
<transcript>: It's not bridges and stuff. It's more generic. First few years after that, you choose an actual field or whatever you want to call that. Okay.

04:14:48
schrew: After all he's done for you today, you're going to repay Dax with a raid?

04:14:52
<transcript>: So Gruntler you said look at the types of json encoder.

04:14:54
<transcript>: That it does support.

04:15:05
<transcript>: So I think I just need to see the output of my operation before I try and send it over the wire and I'll probably have all the clues I need. Maybe if I use logger.

04:15:09
<transcript>: Okay. Great.

04:15:16
<transcript>: I owed up puts maybe I o puts just doesn't work but I can do logger.

04:15:22
<transcript>: Logger info. Yeah, sure.

04:15:25
<transcript>: Oh, no, not that.

04:15:31
<transcript>: Answer. How do I two string something.

04:15:36
<transcript>: Okay. Let's try that.

04:15:43
<transcript>: Most.

04:15:43
<transcript>: points

04:15:47
the_gruntler: Mostly just wanted to see the original error message more. I'm curious if you're not massaging a value enough before passing to JasonEncoder

04:15:47
<transcript>: Points in a game against the.

04:15:47
<transcript>: heat

04:15:49
<transcript>: Heat.

04:16:00
<transcript>: Finally early enough to catch Adam still streaming. Welcome. Chosen none. I do have some strange streaming schedule, especially for Americans.

04:16:08
tardidriss: did adam was convinced that he give one chance over 10000 to win the computer ?

04:16:19
jackdead: later mate, gotta back to work, its 12pm now

04:16:20
<transcript>: Let's see. Welcome to Chat joey. Day. Time to stand. I think I saw on your watch. Yeah, you probably did. It's been a lot of sitting, and I should probably take a break. I'm going to be done with Stream here very shortly and apparently I cannot string. Care is not implemented. How do I stringify something.

04:16:20
<transcript>: in elixir

04:16:21
<transcript>: In elixir.

04:16:24
<transcript>: How do I stringify.

04:16:27
<transcript>: Elixir.

04:16:27
<transcript>: json

04:16:31
<transcript>: Json stringify, Quive.

04:16:31
<transcript>: quivet

04:16:32
jackdead: bye

04:16:32
<transcript>: Quivet.

04:16:37
<transcript>: Does this work.

04:16:40
<transcript>: Json? Encode.

04:16:43
<transcript>: Okay.

04:16:46
<transcript>: Json? Encode.

04:16:54
fragzero_: mj crying :'(

04:17:01
<transcript>: Like the base.

04:17:04
<transcript>: Everything has a json module.

04:17:04
<transcript>: oh

04:17:06
<transcript>: Oh, my goodness.

04:17:08
uarmak: Do you have a public playlist?

04:17:10
<transcript>: Everything you see? That.

04:17:10
<transcript>: plug

04:17:13
<transcript>: Plug. Parsers. Json is that it.

04:17:20
<transcript>: Think of the follows Uormeck and Anthony Shoe Anthony shoe.

anthonyshew: I'm finally awake early enough to catch a stream. :)

04:17:40
uarmak: Thank you <3

04:17:43
<transcript>: Did. Adam was convinced that he gave one chance over 10,000 to win the computer. It is one in 10,000. Yes.

04:17:51
<transcript>: Greeting in my second semester of computer Science. Right now, I've just hit a wall where everything feels so overwhelming.

04:18:01
<transcript>: I didn't go very far past that. I think I did three semesters computer science, and the last one didn't count because I was just playing video games. So I did two semesters.

04:18:01
<transcript>: and

04:18:06
<transcript>: And I'm trying to remember if I remember a wall, I remember.

04:18:09
<transcript>: Feeling like.

04:18:13
<transcript>: Not a wall, but.

04:18:13
<transcript>: is this

04:18:19
<transcript>: Is this worth it? Is College worth it for me? Because I think for some people it is for some people. It's just not.

04:18:19
<transcript>: and

04:18:24
<transcript>: And I don't think it was for me. Where is the json module.

04:18:29
<transcript>: How do I import the json? Let's just chat GPT it.

04:18:29
<transcript>: how do i

04:18:31
<transcript>: How do I.

04:18:31
<transcript>: how

04:18:34
<transcript>: How do I. Json. Stringify.

04:18:38
<transcript>: Map.

04:18:40
<transcript>: In.

04:18:56
greatgrievance: you made it further than me.. i dropped out of university like 3 months after i turned 17

04:18:57
<transcript>: Anthony, welcome to Chat. I'm finally awake early enough to catch stream. Yeah, I stream really early. This is actually 4 hours and 20 minutes in. So for the US, I don't have a lot of friends.

04:18:57
<transcript>: mostly oh j

04:19:00
<transcript>: Mostly. Oh, Jason, it really is. Jason.

04:19:04
<transcript>: How about without an external library.

04:19:04
<transcript>: please

04:19:07
<transcript>: Please don't use any external.

04:19:07
<transcript>: libs

04:19:09
<transcript>: Libs.

04:19:17
<transcript>: You made it further than me. I dropped out of University like three months after I turned 17 and it's working out for great grievance.

04:19:17
<transcript>: great

04:19:22
<transcript>: Great grievance. Very good with the elixir. Very helpful on stream.

04:19:27
the_gruntler: Isn't Jason already included??

04:19:37
the_gruntler: You were getting a JasonEncoder error before

04:19:39
<transcript>: Is this saying I can should I do this if I just need a string of I something right now.

04:19:43
<transcript>: I don't know if it's actually a map.

04:19:50
<transcript>: I was getting A. Json. Encoder. Oh, we already have it. Oh, we already have it. You're right, Grottler. Thank you so much.

04:19:51
the_gruntler: I think the JasonEncoder is the crux of your issue

04:19:55
the_gruntler: You bet

04:19:58
<transcript>: Also gruntler Sorry I didn't take your earlier advice. You try to give me advice and I wasn't ignoring you. I'm just like.

04:19:58
<transcript>: i'm just

04:19:58
the_gruntler: No worries!

04:20:02
greatgrievance: jason is like a most include for every elixir web app

04:20:02
<transcript>: I'm just a little distracted. Okay, so we can use Jason. So.

04:20:03
extremelyryan: Hey Adam

04:20:04
<transcript>: Let's re, Let's.

04:20:06
<transcript>: How about this.

04:20:08
extremelyryan: good morning

04:20:09
<transcript>: Oops never mind.

04:20:11
<transcript>: I already have.

04:20:13
<transcript>: Jason.

04:20:16
<transcript>: Fault.

04:20:20
<transcript>: Give me a json example.

04:20:23
laytanl_: chat gpt is gonna get fed up with you lol

04:20:23
<transcript>: Good Morning. Extremely. Ryan.

04:20:27
<transcript>: Most include for every elixir app. Okay, cool.

04:20:29
<transcript>: I must include.

04:20:29
<transcript>: chad tv

04:20:31
laytanl_: like what do you want human

04:20:34
<transcript>: Chad TV is going to get fed up with me. Yeah, we might test its patience here.

04:20:35
parkour_peter: hello!

04:20:40
<transcript>: I don't need to add the depths. Did you catch that? That I already have it. That's okay. Whatever.

04:20:44
<transcript>: Jason encode. You know what? I can just do this.

04:20:44
<transcript>: do

04:20:49
<transcript>: Do it. I don't need chat. Dbt. It's probably just like literally Jason.

04:20:49
<transcript>: yes

04:20:51
<transcript>: Yes.

04:20:53
<transcript>: Okay.

04:20:56
<transcript>: Jason, cool.

04:20:56
<transcript>: please work

04:20:58
<transcript>: Please work.

04:20:58
<transcript>: please

04:20:59
<transcript>: Please.

04:20:59
<transcript>: work

04:21:01
<transcript>: Work.

04:21:03
<transcript>: Begging.

04:21:03
<transcript>: i'm getting

04:21:07
<transcript>: I'm getting close to the end of my stream here. Most points in a game.

04:21:09
<transcript>: A game against.

04:21:13
<transcript>: Calves. Come on now.

04:21:18
<transcript>: Give me something. I mean, it's not going to work, but I need the log output to be good.

04:21:21
<transcript>: And helpful.

04:21:28
<transcript>: String car is not implemented for error protocol undefined error description json encoder program must be.

04:21:30
<transcript>: What display.

04:21:35
<transcript>: Empty string of type tuple. There's something I'm doing.

04:21:38
<transcript>: It does not like.

04:21:40
the_gruntler: So yeah this is the same issue

04:21:45
<transcript>: So limit answer is doing something to the output that it does not like.

04:21:48
<transcript>: Hello, parkour. Peter. Welcome.

04:21:52
<transcript>: So this is the same issue? Yeah. What is the issue.

04:21:57
<transcript>: What is the deal with display? What is that.

04:22:00
<transcript>: Display. What is wrong with that.

04:22:00
<transcript>: let's do

04:22:03
<transcript>: Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's say.

04:22:07
<transcript>: Let's do this.

04:22:10
<transcript>: Limit visual.

04:22:16
<transcript>: Okay, update. Visual detail.

04:22:18
<transcript>: Of.

04:22:18
<transcript>: the chart

04:22:23
the_gruntler: Somewhere there's a tuple {"display", ""} and the encoder doesn't expect to handle a tuple

04:22:24
<transcript>: The chart, the sign, update, grid, update rows. Let's just pause before we go too far. Here.

04:22:33
<transcript>: Let's just say updated rows instead of scroll. Okay, so scrub row, maybe instead of scrubbing last end.

04:22:33
<transcript>: let's

04:22:36
<transcript>: Let's just see if the rest of this code works.

04:22:41
<transcript>: Let's see if we can get it to work where we just pass in.

04:22:45
<transcript>: Update in act key and then just.

04:22:46
<transcript>: Like.

04:22:46
<transcript>: fun

04:22:48
<transcript>: Fun.

04:22:50
<transcript>: And then.

04:22:52
<transcript>: Like that.

04:22:56
<transcript>: No. What am I doing.

04:22:58
<transcript>: Fun.

04:22:58
<transcript>: x

04:22:59
<transcript>: X.

04:23:07
<transcript>: We're just going to return the same so I'm not going to scrub it. Let's try that. Maybe. Do I have a syntax there.

04:23:13
<transcript>: Wrong.

04:23:15
<transcript>: Oh, fun.

04:23:15
<transcript>: okay

04:23:18
<transcript>: Okay, let's try this.

04:23:26
<transcript>: Somewhere. There's a tuple display empty. And the encoder doesn't expect to handle a tuple. Okay.

04:23:33
<transcript>: Rail key subscribers don't use that's. Fine. Okay, let's try this. Let's see if we can actually just output the same thing back.

04:23:33
<transcript>: most points

04:23:34
<transcript>: Most points.

04:23:34
<transcript>: in a game

04:23:36
<transcript>: In a game.

04:23:36
<transcript>: against

04:23:38
<transcript>: Against The Celtics.

04:23:41
<transcript>: Love this song.

04:23:47
<transcript>: I heard it a long time. I haven't gotten this deep into the playlist. Okay, so still didn't work.

04:23:52
<transcript>: Still didn't work. So there's something wrong with the code before that.

04:23:54
<transcript>: Oh, interesting.

04:23:57
<transcript>: Wait, did it actually dump my thing.

04:23:57
<transcript>: into

04:23:59
<transcript>: Into string form.

04:24:01
<transcript>: Did it. No.

04:24:05
<transcript>: But why.

04:24:09
<transcript>: String cards are influenced for okay.

04:24:20
<transcript>: What am I doing wrong.

04:24:27
<transcript>: Oh, wait, I'm still doing scrub row. Oh, wait.

04:24:27
<transcript>: i'm not

04:24:29
parkour_peter: are you trying to merge statmuse with chatgpt?

04:24:31
<transcript>: I'm not fine. Something wrong with my enum reduce.

04:24:42
<transcript>: Are we trying to merge stat Music chats if you see no parkour, no, we're adding some stuff to the current status site.

04:24:42
<transcript>: i'm in

04:24:51
<transcript>: I'm in the middle of a rewrite. We're rewriting the whole thing from elixir to astro, but we got some stuff we want to add to it first.

04:24:56
<transcript>: Enum reduce takes enumerable, and then the function.

04:24:59
<transcript>: Wait a minute.

04:25:03
<transcript>: Numerable, and then a function.

04:25:03
<transcript>: then

04:25:06
<transcript>: Then why do I have three arguments to it.

04:25:07
the_gruntler: Do you have a git diff? It seems like there's a handful of serialization issues

04:25:09
<transcript>: I have enumerable.

04:25:09
<transcript>: then

04:25:14
<transcript>: Then I have the initial value within a function. Is that just another overload for reduce.

04:25:18
<transcript>: Is there an overload.

04:25:18
<transcript>: that's

04:25:19
<transcript>: That's.

04:25:27
<transcript>: Free inputs. Oh, here we go. Another value for the accumulator use. Reduce. Yeah. Okay. Reduce. Three. There we go.

04:25:31
<transcript>: Interesting.

04:25:35
<transcript>: Wait a minute. Okay. Yeah.

04:25:35
<transcript>: now here's

04:25:37
<transcript>: Now, here's, three.

04:25:46
<transcript>: Fun for each element in numeral with the accumulator initial values. Act function is evoked. Okay.

04:25:56
<transcript>: If we don't call scrub Road, does it work? Let's try this. Let's try.

04:26:02
<transcript>: If updated rows just returns.

04:26:05
<transcript>: Map get.

04:26:05
<transcript>: gr

04:26:06
<transcript>: Grid.

04:26:10
parkour_peter: oh, sorry, I suggested by the natural query you typed

04:26:12
<transcript>: Wait a minute. Update. Rows.

04:26:18
<transcript>: Map get no.

04:26:22
<transcript>: Just return grid.

04:26:26
<transcript>: Does that work. I would hope this would work.

04:26:30
<transcript>: I would hope though most points in a game.

04:26:30
<transcript>: by a pe

04:26:41
<transcript>: By a pelican. I would hope so. Do you have a get this? It seems like there's a handful of serialization issues. Yeah, we've gotten pretty deep here. I do have a. I could create a get diff. Oh, wow. No.

04:26:41
<transcript>: it's still

04:26:45
<transcript>: It's still an issue. Okay, so this goes much deeper.

04:26:45
<transcript>: yeah maybe

04:26:49
<transcript>: Yeah. Maybe I need to look at the diff. Unfortunately, I've been working.

04:26:49
<transcript>: without like

04:26:51
<transcript>: Without like I don't have a bunch of.

04:26:51
<transcript>: incremental

04:26:54
<transcript>: Incremental changes. I've made a ton of changes.

04:27:03
<transcript>: Going to have to get off here. I wonder, is dax streaming? I'm guessing he's been pretty quiet over here, so I'm guessing he's streaming.

04:27:05
<transcript>: Yeah.

04:27:09
<transcript>: Okay.

04:27:12
<transcript>: I'm going to mute him. I'm going to go ahead and end the stream.

04:27:12
<transcript>: i think i'll just

04:27:17
<transcript>: I think I'll just try and sort this out. I really hate to not finish this issue.

04:27:20
<transcript>: But I don't feel like I'm getting closer.

04:27:20
<transcript>: i don't feel like

04:27:28
borchborchtwitch: are you gonna read my github? ;-;

04:27:32
metajezza: Bye. Enjoy rest of your day:)

04:27:32
<transcript>: I don't feel like I'm accelerating toward an amazing finish. And this is when I normally stop my stream. And it's been a long one. I started a little early today, even just been getting up really early.

04:27:35
<transcript>: Are you going to read.

04:27:37
<transcript>: You're going to read my GitHub.
