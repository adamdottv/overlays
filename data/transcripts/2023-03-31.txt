goodgrandpaa: Are you actually vegan/vegetarian?

00:14:14
<transcript>: It's just like the same people and everyone on the West Coast of the United States, where I have a lot of friends. They're all sleeping. So I'd like to try.

00:14:14
<transcript>: an afternoon

00:14:22
<transcript>: An afternoon stream, just occasionally, not very often prepping new lies and scamming ways. This whole scamming thing, it's really gotten out of control.

00:14:24
traylortrash84: Happy Friday.

00:14:27
thdxr: idt you have friends on the west coast

00:14:43
<transcript>: Intros confused me so much. Why click start if you're not ready. Listen, frag, I went from zero to 60, okay? I clicked start so dax could raid me. And then I had to turn on four different cameras. I had to turn on my Edel Chrome rig. I had to turn on lights. I had to change my shirt. Just had a lot to do. Okay? I barely made it back in time.

00:14:45
<transcript>: So.

00:14:45
<transcript>: once

00:14:50
<transcript>: Once you just moderate it's not appreciate your moderator's day today. Frag.

00:14:50
<transcript>: so

00:14:54
<transcript>: So I'm just done appreciating you.

00:14:59

00:15:00
goodgrandpaa: @FragAverage Unprotected today Sadge

00:15:02
<transcript>: Honest Dan Games is here. All the fake books. They are fake. They are all fake. Most of what you see on this stream will be fake.

00:15:02
<transcript>: and you spend

00:15:05
<transcript>: And you spend the next ten minutes capturing all my chat. Please.

00:15:09
thdxr: @hasanhaja they're not rumours!

00:15:12
<transcript>: I'm definitely guilty of that. I fully believe you had kids just to build them. Lego model for the.

00:15:29
<transcript>: Dark. See what happens when you dax go first? Exactly what's rebase TV? Welcome to Chat Medging jard. Welcome. What is rebates TV? It's like hq, trivia. But for developers, dax and I dax Thdxr, we are building it together.

00:15:29
<transcript>: and you can

00:15:31
hasanhaja: Do you think Dax is jealous he won't be getting a macbook like all of us?

00:15:35
<transcript>: And you can sign up at rebase TV, and you'll be notified when we have our first show.

00:15:36
darrenbaldwin03: Whats the rebase.tv stack @adamdotdev ?

00:15:36
goodgrandpaa: @hasanhaja dax is a mod, it's inside knowledge Kappa

00:15:40
<transcript>: Is this a new intro? Every time? It's always the intro. Yeah, it's always.

fossabot: @therealzurx Channel commands are available at: https://fossabot.com/adamdotdev/commands

00:15:56
<transcript>: Ad is just a stream where he gives us all macbooks. Only one person. One person might win. Today might be the day twitch should have subscription plan. They do. Meging, it's called turbo. It's fantastic. You don't see Ads ever. He's walking around the room with multiple cameras, switching scenes with a foot pedal.

00:15:59
hasanhaja: @GoodGrandPaa The infiltration is deep!!

00:16:03
<transcript>: Slider on a backpack Mount that would be some serious production quality.

00:16:03

goodgrandpaa: @hasanhaja This is the way

00:16:10

goodgrandpaa: The mic with the white cover

00:16:19
<transcript>: That's a marshmallow? What's a marshmallow shown his 4k camera. He'll be filming the apology with apology video. What apology video? Okay, I should just catch up. Lara Bars, Android studio? Yes, we're going to use more Android Studio cryo. I'm not super excited about it.

00:16:32
dmdboi: No one talk whilst he catches up

00:16:35
<transcript>: Layton is here. Will we get past Rick Roll up today? Probably not, although I do like dax's. He's got like, it's not Rick roll. It's like an hq trivia example that he's piping. But then I'd have like, change the Ffmpa command and I don't know, doesn't sound worth it. We're going to do the referral thing.

00:16:35
<transcript>: bunch of

00:16:49
<transcript>: Bunch of sweatshop workers in charge of switching cameras. He's yelling at them right now for messing up one of the transitions. Yesterday, my whole overlay thing has been broken so far. Today. I did play with it. I touched it. Sometimes when I touch it, it stops working.

00:16:49
<transcript>: so that's

00:16:53
goodgrandpaa: LUL

00:16:55
goodgrandpaa: Uh..

00:16:57
<transcript>: So that's probably why I made some changes to it. Some content moderation changes so you guys can't just paste Twitter links all Willy nilly.

00:16:57
<transcript>: i love for

<transcript>: I love for Android development. I do love it. I don't love it actually.

00:17:15
<transcript>: Too many scrolling. Scrolling. Scrolling. Where was it? It jumped me down to the bottom.

00:17:36
<transcript>: Light contrast theme. You've been waiting hours. Frag. I told you guys yesterday. Frag, if you were there yesterday, I told you I'm going to stream a different time tomorrow. I'm going to do something different. How long is the call with Adam? Once, redeemed, no one has done it. Midnight. Great question. When someone does it, we'll decide. We'll see how much time they have. I'm willing.

00:17:36
<transcript>: to do

00:17:47
jokestera_e: everyone keeps spending on the macbook lol

00:17:53
<transcript>: To do whatever. I mean like within reason, an hour, maybe an hour, 30 minutes, whatever. We feel like we might get bored and stop talking and then just be like, you want to go? Okay, let's go. Front end development is so boring. I hate my life doing ui for one of the current project. I do hate front end development forms. I hate making forms.

00:17:53
<transcript>: a load

00:17:56
gitpush_gitpaid: can we pool our points?

00:17:58
<transcript>: A Loading bar if the time goes down wow the pretentiousness you demand answers.

00:18:08
<transcript>: How was your oatmeal? It was good. It was great. Hey, Kiwi, I know you're, Kiwi, you are Kiwi. Every time you show up, you say I'm Kiwi.

00:18:13
<transcript>: Has this streamer ever been on time? This is here.

00:18:16

00:18:28
<transcript>: High contrast light themes? Dax and Adam Jump scares today? Did I jump? Scare.

00:18:29
hasanhaja: Would that mean we'll need to share the macbook?

00:18:40
hasanhaja: Dibs on the bottom half!

00:18:43
manbravegg: ETA on the delivery of that?

00:18:47
<transcript>: My transition just kind of jumped. It just like jumped into here I am. We'll see if it works on the next transition. Not sure what the other option is, but I ended stream early because of evening plans. Yeah, I never have evening plans. Alicia. That's my secret. I never have to end anything early. I just don't ever have plans.

00:19:30
<transcript>: Daxodans, bring these scammers, and I think it's getting out of hand. It really is. Hassan. He's it's gotten so out of hand. He sent me a message earlier, and he said something about, like, I don't want this to happen to you. And it was like, a scammer or something happened to a scammer. And I actually believed him for a second. I was like, oh, no, I don't want it to happen to me either. Wait a minute. No, the whole scam thing's a joke.

00:19:30

16:22:06
<transcript>: Lemon podcasting. It's almost like I have moderators that never do shout outs when they should. Come on, you see somebody like Chris Pop in the chat. You shout them out. Michelle, thank you so much for that. Follow.

16:22:16
gitpush_gitpaid: @LemonPodcasting does he pay you in adam bucks?

16:22:18
<transcript>: Like hitting the Twitter API and hitting.

16:22:18
<transcript>: running

16:22:24
<transcript>: Running tensorflow locally to do content moderation on Tweets to make sure you guys don't post.

16:22:30
terawatthour: mods unionize and bring down that tyrant

16:22:39
elysiagriffin: Its not a proper stream until something breaks

16:22:40
<transcript>: This terrible things in front of my Virgin eyes. I did all that work, and now I broke my overlays. Was it worth it? No, it wasn't. Let's go to my screen so that we can listen to music. And we can do something productive. I don't know. That's slander for real.

16:22:41
lemonpodcasting: @LemonPodcasting I'm Canadian so it gets converted to AdamEh bucks.

16:22:41
thdxr: MODS ASSEMBLE

16:22:46
thdxr: Shut down the chat

16:22:47
laytanl_: Ahh that would have been cool to add on stream

16:22:47
<transcript>: Monitor.

16:22:49
goodgrandpaa: transition Pog

16:22:56
<transcript>: Rebase TV.

16:23:00
goodgrandpaa: There was a slight transition there.

16:23:01
<transcript>: Mods assemble shut down the chat. What's that about? Oh, I heard a notification. It works again.

16:23:03
<transcript>: The notifications, work.

16:23:05
<transcript>: Feels good.

16:23:05
<transcript>: so okay

16:23:09
<transcript>: So. Okay, I've got to start a bunch of sst stuff.

16:23:09
<transcript>: i got to

16:23:15
<transcript>: I got to do a bunch of stuff. Oh, that was my April 1 joke. Not that this is the one.

16:23:19
<transcript>: Pmpm, SSO.

16:23:19
thdxr: pull changes

16:23:26
<transcript>: This is going to take ten minutes alone. This is just a ten minute job. I guess I can keep talking. Oh, pool changes. Yes.

16:23:27
rvallez_: git rebase -I HEAD~7

16:23:35
<transcript>: Every time I use a UB key.

16:23:35
<transcript>: it spark

16:23:38
<transcript>: It sparks a little bit of joy. It's just one of those things.

16:23:41
<transcript>: It adds to my day.

16:23:48
<transcript>: Just love it so let's pull the latest get pull.

16:23:57
<transcript>: And now let's do pmpm dev. And then up here, we're going to pop the pmpm SSO.

16:23:59
terawatthour: i feel you should leak some creds to get the stream going

16:24:02
<transcript>: I really need to automate this or something. It's been like ten minutes on it every day.

16:24:06
gitpush_gitpaid: what are the benefits of pnpm... never used it

16:24:10
<transcript>: What's the chart? What's the chart? Say, if I spend ten minutes a day on it, should I automate it.

16:24:13
<transcript>: Npm. Dev on the producer app.

16:24:14
thdxr: he can't leak creds, he uses SST

16:24:17
thdxr: didn't you see my latest video

16:24:18
<transcript>: Does he pay you an Adam Bucks.

16:24:18
<transcript>: that

16:24:20
<transcript>: That's funny.

16:24:28
<transcript>: It's not a proper stream until something breaks it's right, alyssia. Everything is broken today. That must be a really proper stream.

16:24:28
<transcript>: this is

16:24:30
<transcript>: This is an extra proper stream. Today.

16:24:32
alistairdev: Imagine is this was just `pnpm dev:workspaces`?

16:24:34
<transcript>: Canadian. So it gets converted to.

16:24:34
<transcript>: adam

16:24:35
midnightcomm: What’s your pnpm sso Config.

16:24:38
<transcript>: Adam ebux, Adama Bucks.

16:24:40
terawatthour: @thdxr a rhetoric question indeed

16:24:45
<transcript>: That would have been cool to add on stream. There was a slight transition. There was it slight? Did it cut it off? I don't know what's going on.

16:24:45
<transcript>: get

16:24:49
hasanhaja: ".env" files for the win!!

16:24:50
<transcript>: Get rebase? What's that? Do R? Valles? What's that? Do.

16:24:53
<transcript>: Are you just trolling me.

16:24:53
<transcript>: was that trolling

16:24:54
<transcript>: Was that trolling.

16:24:58
<transcript>: I'm not very perceptive of the trolling.

16:25:10
<transcript>: I feel like I shouldn't run that git rebase command, though. I feel like you should leak some creds to get the stream going. Yeah, there you go. Terawatt. What are the benefits of pnpm? Never used it. Did somebody answer that already.

16:25:10
<transcript>: pm

16:25:12
<transcript>: Pmpm, fantastic.

16:25:12
<transcript>: it's actually

16:25:16
manbravegg: Does anyone here run a kinesis advantage?

16:25:21
<transcript>: It's actually correct that's the benefit it's like yarn and npm are not actually correct according to their own specs and they do stuff.

16:25:21
<transcript>: that's just like

16:25:29
thdxr: bunch of people are pissed at my video because it's "secretly an ad for SST"......published by ME on the SST channel talking about how IaC tools in general help

16:25:41
<transcript>: That's just like not a good idea. Pmpm, on the other hand, is super fast. It uses like Simlinks or something. I don't know. I don't really understand the technical reasons it's so fast, but it does less work. It downloads less things and does less work and thusly is more performant. But it's also correct. So it doesn't just automatically download all your peer dependenci.

16:25:41
<transcript>: dependencies and do

16:25:52
<transcript>: Dependencies and do all the stuff that yarn and npm do because people are bad at software and they need to be handheld. Pmpm is like, no, you're a big boy. You're going to figure it out and.

16:25:59
<transcript>: They don't do stuff like that for you. So it doesn't work for a lot of things, because now the whole ecosystem.

16:25:59
<transcript>: is just

16:26:04
<transcript>: Is just half the cards and it's built on npm in the yarn and the way they do things wrong.

16:26:24
<transcript>: Man brave does anyone hear run a Kinesis advantage.

16:26:26
elysiagriffin: @thdxr how dare you

16:26:29
<transcript>: Pmpm sso is just a shortcut.

16:26:29

16:26:49
<transcript>: It's working.

16:26:53
<transcript>: Okay. Feels good.

16:26:58
<transcript>: Feels good. Didn't you see my latest video.

16:27:06
terawatthour: @thdxr i think the channel name should be more obvious to indicate what you advertise, the current state is not enough

16:27:10
<transcript>: Oh, right, yeah, I can't leave creds. I use sst we got rid of in files, people. Dungeon Dragon thank you so much for the follow. I really feel like your username is a t's. Feels like it should be.

<transcript>: A rhetoric question. Indeed. Does anyone here run a kinesis? Okay, I'm caught up. Playlist albato. Welcome to Chat. Welcome, welcome. It is so weird. Streaming at whatever time it is right now. This is weird. Have you tried flutter for Android apps yet? I have not. Elliot.

16:27:41
traylortrash84: You getting any server weather today?

16:27:49
<transcript>: But we did start with React native, and we just had reasons. At least I thought I had reasons to just go to native.

16:28:02
<transcript>: I guess I hated all of my free time and I wanted to learn how to use Android Studio. Now none of that is true. But that's what happened. I guess is we're using Android Studio. Now let's run it. Here we go.

16:28:03
thdxr: @TeraWattHour is that a serious comment?

16:28:07
hasanhaja: I heard flutter was mid. Is this true?

16:28:17
<transcript>: Getting any server weather today? Oh, severe weather? Oh, are we I don't know. Trailer. Are the ozarks getting hit with something? Maybe.

16:28:20
lemonpodcasting: Now I understand why I was getting "ADAM IS STREAMING" notifications at 6am - we're in very different timezones apparently.

16:28:22
overra_dev: They also have a moderation API https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/moderation but > The moderation endpoint is free to use when monitoring the inputs and outputs of OpenAI APIs. We currently do not support monitoring of third-party traffic.

16:28:26
<transcript>: Think the channel name should be more obvious to indicate what you advertise. The current state is not enough. You hear that DAX some feedback.

16:28:34
elysiagriffin: Alrighty I gotta head off, good luck with the mobile app buildin'

16:28:35
<transcript>: Feedbacks for dax. Now I understand why I was getting Adam is streaming notifications at 06:00 a.m. We're in very different times, apparently.

rvallez_: git rebase is what pisses some people off  https://twitter.com/vprdev/status/1623764502356365312

16:30:00
<transcript>: So I've used the trackpad for a couple of years. I think I did it originally hoping I would use my keyboard less, but Vim did that for me. Vim is the reason I use my keyboard less. Not my trackpad, but I like the trackpad.

16:30:08
devagrawal09: adam with white tshirt instead of black?

16:30:14
sanskar__: heyy

cmgriffing: key to track pads is to move from the elbow and shoulder. not from the finger or wrist unless you need to gesture or something

16:30:46

lemonpodcasting: Gotta run and edit the tomorrow episode.. send me all the adambucks if you want me to release the secret episodes. ;)

16:30:52
<transcript>: Is more my way south of you. Okay. I didn't know anything about weather today. I mean, on most of the days, I don't.

16:30:59
mejingjard: @adamdotdev 100% more carpal tunnel if you use a trackpad, keyboards + mouse are the less destructive way according to physiotherapists

16:31:03
<transcript>: Adam, what do you think about the six month pause, petition and stuff? So we just recorded a podcast yesterday. Samskar, thank you for the follow.

16:31:03

16:31:17
<transcript>: So the pause is interesting. Is it actually going to happen.

16:31:17
<transcript>: is

16:31:26
<transcript>: Is the pause actually happening? Because my opinion might be different depending on if it's actually happening. I don't know. I think it's interesting. I can't think of another time in history where.

16:31:26
<transcript>: we would have paus

16:31:29
<transcript>: We would have paused. Technological innovation.

16:31:29
<transcript>: and

16:31:30
mehulsharmamat: no idea - BUT italy banned chatgpt

16:31:57
<transcript>: Use vim mode and Android Studio No Hasan.

16:31:57
<transcript>: i don't know

16:31:59
<transcript>: I don't know. I've just kind of decided.

16:31:59
<transcript>: like maybe

16:32:02
gitpush_gitpaid: @cmgriffing makes sense. i just always wondered how it would be just putting pressure on just the index finger consistently

16:32:02
estrangedhd: Some guy in my country commited suicide because chatgpt told him to do so

16:32:12
mehulsharmamat: the yudkowsky podcast (lex fridman) is really good -- and it gets me worried like the paperclip thought experiment and stuff

16:32:15
<transcript>: Like maybe I don't want to get too customized here in Android Studio. I'd like to be in Android Studio as little as possible. And if I start customizing it, then I'm worried I'll start liking it and using it. I don't know. I just don't want to use Android Studio. I'm only here out of obligation.

<transcript>: chris

16:32:36
<transcript>: Chris Keys of trackpads is to move from the elbow and shoulder, not from the finger or wrists, unless you need to gesture or something. Okay, that makes sense.

16:32:38
cmgriffing: @gitpush_gitpaid I use my middle finger most

16:32:39
<transcript>: So I got to use my elbow.

16:32:40
mehulsharmamat: @EstrangedHD wait for real?

16:32:43

16:32:46
estrangedhd: @mehulsharmamat yes

16:32:48
<transcript>: Send me all the Adam Bucks if you want me to release the secret episodes.

16:32:56
lesabotsy: My wife is Italian, she told me the Italian government is the most incompetent corrupt people on the planet, no wonder they hate tech

16:33:00
manbravegg: I still dont get why people are so against AI it makes so many things possible, and work so much more efficient. Feels like a massive net benefit.

16:33:01
<transcript>: Did I see it? Welcome to Chat. No more carpal Tunnel. If you use tripod keyboards plus mouse are the less destructive way, according to physiotherapists. Interesting.

16:33:06
estrangedhd: @mehulsharmamat Belgium

16:33:08
gitpush_gitpaid: the 6 month AI ban makes no sense. no ones going to stop developing their AI... going to end up with dataset bootleggers. imagine the al capone of AI

16:33:11
<transcript>: Interesting. Interesting. You didn't hear all the Thunder last night? I did not. Maliro. Was there Thunder last night? I must have slept great last night. I didn't hear a thing.

16:33:24
<transcript>: Shrew. Hello. Late night streamer. Yeah. Late night for you. This is afternoon. Normally, I start my stream, and I'm like, Good morning, everybody. And this today.

traylortrash84: Oh yeah, lots of thunder and lightning last night.

16:33:41
<transcript>: Italy. Van Chad, I'll use AI to adjust your opinion if it's changed. That's funny. Okay, see you, Chris. Oh, you guys are talking about the anti AI manifesto. Yeah. Dev, do you know, did it happen? Is it actually going to happen? Adam does more for Europe than fdr did just by streaming in such nice hours.

16:33:46
overra_dev: sure lets pause progress and fall behind more

16:33:46
<transcript>: Why the Rick roll getting laggy? Uhoh, is it laggy? That could be a problem.

16:33:54
terawatthour: @Lesabotsy well italy has had 66 different governments since 1945

16:34:02
<transcript>: Some guy in my country committed suicide because Chad gbg told you told him to. Oh, my goodness. Are you serious? Estranged. That's awful. The yud koski podcast lex friedman is really good and it gets me worried. Like the paperclip thought experiment and stuff. What's the paperclip thought experiment.

16:34:05
<transcript>: What is that.

16:34:12
<transcript>: Chris uses his middle finger most me too.

16:34:32
cmgriffing: @Mejingjard Im pretty sure those studies actually refer to the trackpads on your laptop which are really bad wrist. external trackpads rarely get tested as well

16:34:32
<transcript>: I just had to comment on the middle finger. What country? My wife is Italian. She told me the Italian government is the most incompetent, corrupt people on the planet. No one do. They hate tech. I still don't go. Why people are so against AI if it makes so many things okay, am I sufficiently behind that I should just not try and work. Yes, we're going to come over here. Hey, transition the word.

16:34:34
<transcript>: Terra.

16:34:40
mehulsharmamat: @adamdotdev the paperclip thing:   how can humans control a super-intelligent AI even when the AI is orders of magnitude smarter. Bostrom's thought experiment goes like this: suppose that someone programs and switches on an AI that has the goal of producing paperclips. The AI is given the ability to learn, so that it can invent ways to achieve its goal better. As the AI is super-intelligent, if there is a way of turning something into paperclips, it will find it. It will want to secure resources

16:34:43
<transcript>: It's weird. It's weird to stream at a different time. It's just like, I don't realize how many habits I've built up, and just how many.

16:34:57
lesabotsy: @terawatthour damn that's a lot

16:34:58
<transcript>: Associations like feeling groggy when I first start the stream, it's weird to be like middle of my day, not groggy. And here talking with you all, let's see. The six month AI band makes no sense. Well, no one's going to stop developing the era, going to end up with.

16:34:58
<transcript>: the data set

16:35:08
<transcript>: The data set bootleggers. Imagine the Al capone of AI. Oh, boy, that's kind of a scary thought. My wife is Italian. She's the only Italian government. Oh, yeah, I already read that.

16:35:18
<transcript>: I still don't get why people are so against AI. It makes so many things possible and work so much more efficient. Feels like a massive net benefit. Yeah, man. Brave. I agree.

16:35:18
<transcript>: i think what i

16:35:19
manbravegg: Are those transitions an obs thing or just html and css animation transition?

16:35:22
goodgrandpaa: Jk. Project manager is off today.

16:35:24
<transcript>: I think what I thought I read about the pause thing. Was it just because they want to make sure we have.

16:35:30
<transcript>: Safety protocols or like governing bodies or something. So we don't create.

16:35:30
<transcript>: something that

16:35:46
thdxr: openai is going to transform the world......but also wtf do people really think they're on the path to AGI???

16:35:49
<transcript>: Something that takes over everything and cripples our entire digital world. I don't know. That's what I gathered. But then it's probably like, Google execs and stuff that are signing this thing. And they're like, so far behind that. That's why they want to pause, like, open AI. You need to stop. Stop it. You're too far ahead.

16:35:49
<transcript>: that's

16:35:54
thdxr: how can you be worried about this right now

16:35:54
<transcript>: That's what I kind of thought, but I don't know much about it. Somebody tell me more if you know more.

16:35:54
<transcript>: belg

16:35:56
mehulsharmamat: Yep. Safety protocols. If AGI does not align with human intents (which we all dont align for ourselves collectively) it's gonna be difficult

16:35:57
<transcript>: Belgium man, that sucks.

16:36:02
kodder: Morning

16:36:03
<transcript>: Lots of Thunder and lightning last night. Yeah, I missed it. I missed the storm. I was asleep, I guess.

16:36:03
goodgrandpaa: @adamdotdev Any advice on switching from vegetarian to vegan? Still wanna go to flavor town but not raise the cost of eating too much.

16:36:05
dmmulroy: After seeing congress try to understand TikTok and Crypto I have 0 faith for any sort of good regulation to occur from a 6 month pause

16:36:11
mehulsharmamat: @thdxr i dont think but what if yknow

16:36:23
<transcript>: Mayhew the paperclip thing, how can humans control a superintelligent AI, even when the AI is orders of magnitude smarter? Bostrom sought experiment goes like this. Suppose that someone programs and switches on an AI that has the goal of producing paperclips the AI.

16:36:23
<transcript>: is given the ability

16:36:38
<transcript>: Is given the ability to learn so that it can invent ways to achieve its goal better, as the AI is super intelligent. If there is a way of turning something into paperclips, it will find it. It will want to secure resources. Oh boy, I think I know where this is headed.

16:36:42
<transcript>: Let's see.

16:36:47
<transcript>: Oh, did you finish that thought? Maybe not.

16:36:50
mehulsharmamat: full thing: but couldnt paste more https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/ai-and-paperclip-problem

16:36:51
<transcript>: Didn't win a macbook. Good try. Imposter.

16:36:51
<transcript>: you tried just

16:36:54
cmgriffing: it heads to the iron in our blood

16:36:54
<transcript>: You tried just like everybody else. Good try.

16:36:54
<transcript>: are those

16:36:58
sasankthapa: google signed the petition then proceeded to announce bard

16:36:59
<transcript>: Are those transitions an obs thing, or just html and CSS, they are html and CSS.

16:37:02
maleero: @thdxr Where can I watch the full video with Fred that you tweeted a few days ago? Or is it not out yet?

16:37:05
<transcript>: My overlay app is responsible for all that I don't use actual obs transitions.

16:37:05
<transcript>: project manage

16:37:07
<transcript>: Project manager is off today. Nice.

16:37:07
<transcript>: no stand

16:37:13
thdxr: @maleero releasing it on monday or tuesday

16:37:13
<transcript>: No stand up. Nothing like missing a stand up feels good. Opener is going to transform the world but also.

16:37:13
<transcript>: wt

16:37:19
cmgriffing: @mehulsharmamat the actual hypothesis is not necessarily about smart AI, but instead naive AI

16:37:27
mehulsharmamat: The AI is single-minded and more ingenious than any person, so it will appropriate resources from all other activities. Soon, the world will be inundated with paperclips.

16:37:28
<transcript>: Wtf do people really think they're on the path to agi? No, I don't. How could you be worried about this right now? Yeah. No, that's true. I think that paper that Microsoft put out there were like sparks of agi. I think that probably scared some people.

16:37:28
<transcript>: but

16:37:28
gitpush_gitpaid: @thdxr thats what im saying. were about to go into ww3 and the dollar is about to be dethroned by adam bucks and dave n busters points but people think chatgpt is the issue

16:37:29
<transcript>: But.

16:37:29
<transcript>: it's also their

16:37:30
<transcript>: It's also their product.

16:37:33
<transcript>: So I don't know. Are they unbiased.

16:37:35
pedrohsf: Vscode or Neovim

16:37:36
manbravegg: They have a governing body. OpenAI actively patches things constantly to make the AI less usable for negative things. Maybe they could be a little bit more restrictive and slower with releases though?

16:37:46
<transcript>: Vgi does not align with human intents, which we all don't align for ourselves. Collectively, it's going to be difficult. Yeah, that's a good point. What is human intent? You ask people from five different countries. They all have different intents. So How's that work.

16:37:46
<transcript>: how does

16:37:51
<transcript>: How does that work? Good morning, cotter. Good afternoon. Good morning.

16:38:01
mehulsharmamat: @cmgriffing yep. most of the times AI does not choose to be evil, but something stupid like "make more money" and it ends up doing stuff that's not nice.

16:38:03
kodder: it is always morning for me, always half sleepy

16:38:08
<transcript>: Any advice on switching from vegetarian to vegan still want to go to flavortown but not raise the cost of eating too much. I don't think going from vegetarian to vegan, you'll raise the cost of eating too much. If you're already eating vegetarian, then you're already exposed to produce prices and.

16:38:08
<transcript>: you're just going to basically keep

16:38:18
<transcript>: You're just going to basically keep doing the produce thing and stop doing the dairy and the other things. And I don't think you'll see a real increase in price. Just avoid all the vegan, junk food.

16:38:18
<transcript>: it's exp

16:38:20
goodgrandpaa: Fair enough :) Thanks!

16:38:20
<transcript>: It's expensive and bad for you.

16:38:25
<transcript>: But any advice? I don't know. I guess. Do you eat eggs, eggs, dairy.

16:38:29
<transcript>: I think eggs are the last thing we gave up.

16:38:31
<transcript>: That's how we did it.

16:38:31
<transcript>: we went from

16:38:38
<transcript>: We went from a standard American diet to vegan over the course of a few months just by phasing things out more and more over time.

16:38:50
<transcript>: The immoral after seeing Congress tried to understand TikTok and crypto had zero faith for any sort of good rail Asian. That's so true. Yeah. Is our government even going to be able to do anything in six months? Probably not. Not in the us.

16:38:53
terawatthour: fun fact: italy has recently banned lab-produced meat to preserve cultural heritage and cuisine

16:38:54
<transcript>: What do you know full thing.

16:38:57
<transcript>: It keeps jumping. Me. Chad didn't used to do that.

16:38:57
<transcript>: twitch

16:39:02
<transcript>: Twitch Chat has started doing that. It jumps. Really drives me crazy.

16:39:02
<transcript>: couldn't pay

16:39:03
goodgrandpaa: @TeraWattHour They're on one lol.

16:39:07
<transcript>: Couldn't pay tomorrow. Oh, I got you so I'll read that on my own time. So the AI paperclip problem.

16:39:11
<transcript>: Heads to the iron in our blood. Oh, boy.

16:39:20
<transcript>: Yikes like I could make paper clips out of these humans. Google signed the petition and proceeded to announce bard. Yeah, exactly.

16:39:21
alfredguimaz: how have u enjoyed android dev so far

16:39:22
goodgrandpaa: @TeraWattHour "do it for the culture" is getting scary.

16:39:33
<transcript>: Where can I watch the full video with Fred that you tweeted a few days ago? Or is it not out yet? When is that coming out? Monday or Tuesday? Thank you, dax. I'm very excited for it. Actual hypothesis is not necessarily about smart AI, but instead naive AI.

16:39:45
<transcript>: The AI is single minded and more ingenuous than any person, so it will appropriate resources from all other activities. Soon the world will be inundated with paperclips. Interesting.

16:39:45
<transcript>: i had never heard

16:39:47
<transcript>: I had never heard of this.

16:39:54
<transcript>: Dollar is about to be dethroned by Adam Bucks and Dave and buster's points.

16:40:03
<transcript>: If D is the issue, welcome to chat. Pedro vs. Coder neovim. I use neo. Vim.

16:40:03
<transcript>: unfortunately

16:40:12
<transcript>: Unfortunately the last few days you will have seen me in Android Studio, which is maybe the opposite of Neovim. If you were to take neo vim.

16:40:13
mehulsharmamat: oh yeah playing some alt-j love it

16:40:19
<transcript>: And take Android studio and make circles to create a vin diagram. The circles don't touch.

16:40:36
<transcript>: They are very, very different. I used to use Vs. Code, but in the last eight months I've been on neo vim, and I love it. They have a governing body openai, actively patches things constantly to make the AI less usable for negative things. Maybe they could be a little bit more restrictive and slower with releases, though.

16:40:47
<transcript>: Most of the times AI does not choose to be evil, but something stupid, like make my where did it go? Make more money, and it ends up doing stuff that's not nice. Yeah, it's kind of like people.

16:40:47
<transcript>: it's always

16:40:56
<transcript>: It's always morning for me always have sleepy. Okay. Fun. Fact. Italy has recently banned lab produced meat to preserve cultural heritage and cuisine.

16:40:56
<transcript>: interesting

16:41:06
<transcript>: Interesting. I mean, labs produce meat. Lab produced meat. Maybe not the healthiest thing in the world. Anyway, it's not so bad to ban that.

16:41:13
<transcript>: How have you enjoyed Android dev so far? I hate it, alfred. Like I legitimately hate it.

16:41:14
thdxr: lab produced meat is different than plant based meat

16:41:19
<transcript>: It's just like, I guess I've gotten so into the web Dev world that.

16:41:19
<transcript>: it's like

16:41:23
thdxr: it's still animal protein

16:41:30
goodgrandpaa: @thdxr Yeah, it's cultured through swab, right?

16:41:38
<transcript>: It's like bringing back concepts like mvvm and dependency injection. And just like all these OPP things that I just didn't miss. I guess I didn't miss them since I've gotten into web dev. We don't really do that stuff much. I know people will come at me and be like, you can do dependency ejection in the Web, but yeah, like, but who does? I don't know. Does anybody do that? Still.

16:41:39
<transcript>: i feel like

16:41:41
<transcript>: I feel like this is still so complicated.

16:41:47
<transcript>: Okay, lapidu's meat is different than plant based meat. It's still animal protein. Oh, really.

16:41:53
<transcript>: So plant based meat like Impossible Burger. You're saying lab produced meat is like.

16:41:53
<transcript>: where they

16:42:03
<transcript>: Where they take, like, I don't know, mammoth DNA. I heard something about. And then they produce meat in the lab. Okay. That's different. Yeah.

16:42:03
alfredguimaz: Can they take the OOP out of Mobile dev

16:42:05
<transcript>: That's pretty gross, actually.

16:42:06
mehulsharmamat: A kinda "good" scenario with AI is the Love Death Robots episode "When the yogurt takes over"

16:42:18
mehulsharmamat: kinda brave new world tho still

16:42:23
thdxr: Adam would be grossed out by my freezer

16:42:26
<transcript>: Can they take the oop out of mobile dev? Well, you know, there's like Expo and flutter and all these things. I suppose those are less like I know Expo. My brief experience with Expo, it's definitely less of that, right? It's not oop. It feels like modern web dev, but.

16:42:26
<transcript>: it also

16:42:32
<transcript>: It also, it's like so many layers of abstraction. I don't even know what I'm doing anymore. Like what is being produced by what I write.

16:42:33
oskrm: Did you try capacitor?

16:42:37
<transcript>: Be grossed out by your freezer. Do you have a bunch of lab grown meat? Dax.

16:42:37
thdxr: that episode is so good

16:42:45
thdxr: no just a ton of meat in general

16:42:47
<transcript>: Kind of good scenario with AI is the Love Death Robots episode when the yogurt takes over. I've not seen that, but I'm very curious now.

16:42:51
<transcript>: Just a ton of meat in general. Sounds gross. You.

16:42:55
thdxr: love death robots season 1 is insane

16:42:59
<transcript>: I would be gross. That next. Maybe we shouldn't live next to each other. Maybe we should stay in our corners of us.

16:43:04
<transcript>: Okay. I guess we're going to do something. Let's do something.

16:43:04
<transcript>: love death

16:43:06
mehulsharmamat: s2 is mid but s3 is amazing! esp the last ep

16:43:08
thdxr: Zima blue ooooof

16:43:11
<transcript>: Love Death Robots season one is insane. Okay, so is this on thing I need to watch? Is this a recommendation? If I ever go back to watching.

16:43:14
mehulsharmamat: absolutely absolutely

16:43:16
<transcript>: Stuff on TV. That's what I should watch. Is that what you're telling me.

16:43:16
<transcript>: zim

16:43:18
thdxr: just watch the Zima blue episode it's 20min

16:43:19
<transcript>: Zima blue, oof.

16:43:19
oskrm: Did you try capacitor? 󠀀

16:43:20
laytanl_: Yeah memorable episode lol

16:43:22
gitpush_gitpaid: if yogurt takes over would that mean Greece is the world power?

16:43:23
pedrohsf: Yess, this and severance

16:43:27
<transcript>: Season two is mid, but season three is amazing. Especially the last episode. Just watch the zima Blue episode. It's 20 minutes. Okay.

16:43:27
<transcript>: zim

16:43:32
thdxr: even you will have emotions watching that episode

16:43:38
<transcript>: Zima blue. Did you try capacitor? I did not Oscar. I did not try capacitor. I went from Expo React native straight to kotlin and Android studio.

16:43:41
laytanl_: Should just let yoghurt take over tbh

16:43:43
sasankthapa: you could install ideavim plugin on android studio for some vim keybinds

16:43:44
<transcript>: And it's been quite an experience. There's a lot of files. There's a lot of files.

16:43:46
mehulsharmamat: @laytanl_ lmao

16:43:50
<transcript>: Like the web Dev community, they must not know this is going on because.

16:43:50
<transcript>: this is

16:43:52
<transcript>: This is something.

16:43:56
<transcript>: So just let yogurt take over to be honest.

16:44:01
lesabotsy: @adamdotdev Lab grown meat is better than killing a bunch of animals or breading them just to eat them isn't it?

16:44:05
<transcript>: Even I will have emotions watching that episode. What's it about? Somebody just give me the give me the elevator pitch for zima Blue? What is zima blue.

16:44:12
mehulsharmamat: existentialism

16:44:12
<transcript>: This and severance is severance a TV show.

16:44:18
mehulsharmamat: zima blue ^

16:44:19
<transcript>: Or is that are you talking about something else you can install idea vim plugin on Android Studio for some vim key bindings.

16:44:29
camdickie: hi adam!!!

16:44:35
<transcript>: I just am not really trying to customize the Android Studio thing. Lab grown meat is better than killing a bunch of animals or breeding them just to eat them, isn't it? Yeah, I think so. Well, no for sure. But what's better than all that is just not killing yourself with meat because.

16:44:35
<transcript>: it's not good

16:44:37
pedrohsf: Yes, severance is a tv show from apple tv

16:44:44
<transcript>: It's not good for your body. Sorry. Just facts. Dax, I don't know what to tell you. It's not good for your body. I'm okay with everyone eating meat.

16:44:44
<transcript>: i'm not okay with

16:44:47
<transcript>: I'm not okay with me eating meat or anyone in my family.

16:44:49
<transcript>: Sorry.

16:44:51

16:44:58
laytanl_: It's delicious though

16:44:58
goodgrandpaa: I like that take haha

16:44:59
<transcript>: Was that like my hottest take ever she's coming out against meat zima blue existentialism? Could someone give me.

16:44:59
<transcript>: a description

16:45:02
<transcript>: A description of that I understand.

16:45:12
<transcript>: Or maybe more words. Cam. Dickey's. Here, severance is a TV show from Apple TV. Okay, the secret ingredient is killing.

16:45:15
<transcript>: Killing in meat.

16:45:15
<transcript>: you like that

16:45:18
thdxr: severance was so good

16:45:19
goodgrandpaa: @laytanl_ So is high fructose corn syrup lol

16:45:19
<transcript>: You like that? Take. Okay. Good. Grandpa's on my side.

16:45:19
<transcript>: i don't know

16:45:32
<transcript>: I don't know. I just think animal products are bad for your body. That's all. Severance was so good. So is high fructose corn syrup? No, totally. Yeah, I don't eat that either. Wait, somebody's going to tell me what is existentialism. Do I need to Google it.

16:45:34
<transcript>: Let's Google it.

16:45:36
<transcript>: Existentialism.

16:45:43
<transcript>: Philosophical theory or approach, which emphasizes the existence of the individual person as.

16:45:43
<transcript>: a free and

16:45:43
thdxr: I'm gonna live longer than Adam to prove him wrong about meat

16:45:44
haliphax: existentialism is the belief that god does not exist, and that morality is a default property of humanity and does not need the existence of god

16:45:48
<transcript>: A free and responsible agent, determining their own development through acts of the will.

16:45:48
<transcript>: why

16:45:53
<transcript>: Why am I not very smart? Like I read all that. And I heard all the words, but I don't understand.

16:46:03
mehulsharmamat: The renowned artist Zima recounts his mysterious past and rise to fame before unveiling his final work.  This tells you nothing about Zima blue tho lol

16:46:04
<transcript>: It's the belief that God does not exist and that morality is the default property of humanity and does not need the existence of God. And that's what the episode is about.

16:46:16
<transcript>: Dex is going to live longer than me to prove prove me wrong about meat. Well, it could be a lot of other things. Sex. What if I get hit by a bus? I mean, I don't live with there's buses, but what if I got hit by.

16:46:16
oskrm: those words... i recognise them but not together

16:46:17
haliphax: no idea, I just popped in when you asked what existentialism is LUL

16:46:21
<transcript>: Tractor? What if I got hit by a tractor and died? Then that doesn't prove anything.

16:46:21
<transcript>: so

16:46:23
<transcript>: So jokes on you.

16:46:23
<transcript>: i still

16:46:25
tumtumpkinz: Have you seen Fireship's AWS for Haters video?

16:46:26
thdxr: if you eat meat you can survive a tractor hit

16:46:26
<transcript>: I still probably was healthier I don't know.

16:46:27
goodgrandpaa: I genuinely didn't stop eating meat because meat TASTES bad. Morals for me

16:46:31
terawatthour: @haliphax well we live in XXI century and if someone needs god to be just a decent human being then thats a problem

goodgrandpaa: @thdxr Maybe at 2mph LUL

16:51:55
<transcript>: Lesa Boy, you're so humble, man. Shut up. You're really smart, handsome and entertaining. What? What did I say? That got that. Then I'll take it, leslie. But what was that? Tractor was farming. Veggies.

16:52:31
<transcript>: I don't know, Terry, for real, though I haven't used aws still, and I'm kind of scared to call myself a songwriter. No mail. You don't have to use aws to be a software engineer.

16:52:31

16:52:37
kryotoboi: I am nuu

16:52:41
<transcript>: I do think aws is worth learning and I think too many people are scared because there's some rough edges. But it's also the best way to build most anything on the internet.

16:52:48
goodgrandpaa: (elwood dog ranch is not a real thing, it's a marketing page that compares the way people breed animals, but keep other animals as pets and are adamantly against breeding/killing domestic pets for consumption)

16:52:49
<transcript>: It's good that you don't know who Terry was because God told him to or something. Terry Davis, the greatest programmer who ever lived.

16:53:33
<transcript>: Terry was a fantastic programmer that unfortunately, struggled with mental illness and had a tragic story. Okay, well, I'm feeling like maybe I won't look it up because tragic stories, I think the fewer those I know the better off I am. Welcome to Chat Allen Derridy. Is this using the composting nude Android Dev myself? No.

16:53:35
<transcript>: Allen.

16:53:35
<transcript>: i told everybody

16:53:42
<transcript>: I told everybody it was. I kept saying, like, no, guys, I'm using jetpack compose until someone pointed out that I'm not actually.

16:53:54
<transcript>: So I thought I was, but I think we switched. I was just building it raw. And then I decided there's this template that was going to save us some time. And the template is not using it. So no, I'm not using jetpack compose.

16:53:54

<transcript>: cry

16:54:06
thdxr: oh great so we have tech debt already!

16:54:15
<transcript>: Cryo is new. Elwood Dog ranch is not a real thing. It's a marketing page that compares the way people breed animals, but keep other animals as pets and are adamantly against breeding, killing domestic pets for consumption. Yeah, that's a great point. So good. Grandpa.

16:54:15
<transcript>: this

16:54:28
<transcript>: This is something that is interesting to me. As a vegan, as someone who only eats plants, it's funny to me that people are like, yeah, kill all the cows, eat them. But they're like, don't kill a dog. You don't kill dogs, just cows.

16:54:28
<transcript>: and

16:54:34

16:54:36

<transcript>: It's all rough edges, says dread pirate.

16:55:01

16:55:07
caelic01: @thdxr Because they evolved alongside humans as companions

16:55:18
<transcript>: Probably have to use a combination of Docker plus aws to automate a site, but I don't know what any of those words mean. So I started a new side project that was easier. That sounds fine. Sounds fine. Mayhew, when it's time, when you're ready for it and then it's time and you'll you'll you'll be up for it. But just don't. Don't rush into it.

16:55:23
goodgrandpaa: @Caelic01 Ultimate human compliment? Kappa

16:55:33
caelic01: @bananscode true. exist or not exist. If they don't get eaten, they soon don't exist

16:55:37
thdxr: Adam is smart, runs super advanced scams

16:55:39
<transcript>: Yourself not smart. We are all smart in our own way. Oh, did I say I wasn't smart? Sorry. I do say things like that a lot. It's just like sometimes I'm not sure what my brain is good at. I know I've had some success in my career, and I know I'm very fortunate to have had a career where I can make a lot of money working from home, a lot of good things. Sometimes I just don't know why.

16:55:39
<transcript>: do i

16:55:52
<transcript>: Do I read that sentence? Why couldn't I understand it? Like something about that sentence. There's just no chance that I was going to understand it. It was like something about philosophy and something. Something. I think I'm just too, like, grounded in pragmatism or something. And if anything gets.

16:55:52
<transcript>: too like

16:55:53
mehulsharmamat: I guess I should lol. Recently left my work position for some breather, maybe a good time to learn AWS/Rust and make projects I've put off.

16:55:55
<transcript>: Too. Like fluffy out there.

16:55:55
<transcript>: i can't my brain

16:56:01
<transcript>: I can't. My brain just doesn't do it. So it makes me feel like I'm not smart, but smart is not the right word.

16:56:01
<transcript>: i'm not an

16:56:09
<transcript>: I'm not an intellectual, if you will. Okay, I guess I'm going to hydrate because Oscar highlighted a message that says, hydrate. And why not.

16:56:14
mehulsharmamat: @TeraWattHour how can I be a mod to ban someone

16:56:15
<transcript>: Oh, great. So we have Tech dead already. Yeah. Dax, I did think about the fact that.

16:56:15
<transcript>: i don't know maybe

16:56:23
thdxr: I finally got a new water bottle and my pee isn't dark anymore

16:56:27
<transcript>: I don't know. Maybe we should convert all this, but look at all these xml files. Like should I convert all this to jetback compose? I don't know. Looks like a lot of work dogs are cuter. Cows are meant to be eaten.

16:56:27
<transcript>: are they

16:56:35
<transcript>: Are they bannons? Welcome to chats. Welcome, welcome, explain yourself, bandons. Why are cows meant to be eaten.

16:56:35
terawatthour: @TeraWattHour u mad and wrong

16:56:40
<transcript>: Don't they aren't cast meant to be eaten in Asia.

16:56:41

overra_dev: @adamdotdev won a MacBook!!!

16:56:43
goodgrandpaa: @thdxr Nice!

16:56:45
<transcript>: Or something? Aren't there countries where people eat horses and cats and stuff.

16:56:45
<transcript>: but like in

16:56:49
<transcript>: But like in the Western Society, it's like, no, you don't eat horses.

16:56:51
<transcript>: They have feelings.

16:57:00
<transcript>: Exactly that's the concept behind the page on there. People are so passionate to they get such reactions like, you should go to hell for eating dogs.

16:57:04
mehulsharmamat: @TeraWattHour i use rust btw. there, I win.

16:57:05
<transcript>: It's interesting. I mean, just really step back and think about it.

16:57:08
caelic01: a horse has always been too useful to eat

16:57:08
<transcript>: Like what is different about.

16:57:08
<transcript>: cows and

16:57:14
<transcript>: Cows and dogs. Someone explained it to me, and I want you to really think about it before you explain it.

16:57:14
<transcript>: because

16:57:19
caelic01: as ar dogs

16:57:20
thdxr: cows taste better

16:57:24
<transcript>: Because they evolved a long side. Humans as companions. Oh, interesting. So that's the okay. So because we've treated them as companions.

16:57:32
<transcript>: Then we shouldn't kill them. But since we treat cows as food, it's okay to kill them.

16:57:32
<transcript>: see the problem

16:57:39
<transcript>: See the problem with that? It's all about what we think. See the problem? I don't know. I'm not somebody who has.

16:57:41
caelic01: cows are useless except for eating

16:57:43
prezus: Horse meat is yummy, you can buy it in western countries

16:57:48
gitpush_gitpaid: imagine everyone coming in from seeing a thumbnail of coding to just hear a convo about killing and eatings dogs and cows

16:57:49
<transcript>: Real strong convictions about this stuff. But I do just think, like logically. There's a lot of fallacies. Look at me using big words, like logical and fallacy. I just said I wasn't an intellectual.

16:57:49
caelic01: they need to up their usefulness and we'll stop eating them

16:57:51
<transcript>: I might be.

16:57:52
thdxr: in Adams world cows wouldn't even exist. he's basically advocating for genocide

16:57:55
<transcript>: Let's see Cats greater than Dogs ultimate human compliment.

16:57:59
<transcript>: True exist or not exist if they don't get eaten.

16:58:00
caelic01: ^^ facts

16:58:04
<transcript>: If they don't get eaten I missed the message because it jumped.

16:58:05
kryotoboi: Can't we all just eat sugar all the time?

16:58:06
<transcript>: I miss it.

16:58:06
bishopdev: me and the cows voted .. we agreed beef is delicious

16:58:09
<transcript>: If they don't get eaten.

16:58:12
<transcript>: They soon don't exist.

16:58:12
<transcript>: what

16:58:18
<transcript>: What? Oh, you're saying? Like if we don't, if we didn't eat cows, we wouldn't.

16:58:18
<transcript>: raise

16:58:18
mehulsharmamat: it's so easy living in a country where most people are vegetarians anyway. My body auto-rejects meat and stuff (even chicken)

16:58:21
<transcript>: Raise so many and breed so many therefore.

16:58:21
<transcript>: it's better

16:58:23
<transcript>: It's better that.

16:58:33
<transcript>: We breed them and they get to have a life for some amount of time. Gording on corn before we kill them and eat them. That's better than if they just never existed.

16:58:33
<transcript>: maybe i

16:58:35
<transcript>: Maybe I don't know.

16:58:35
<transcript>: i don't have

16:58:49
haliphax: same with chickens

16:58:55
<transcript>: I guess I should lol recently left my work position for some breather. Maybe a good time to learn AWS, rest and make projects I've put off. Aws is a fun rabbit hole. It is.

<transcript>: How can I be a mod to ban someone.

16:59:20
lesabotsy: @thdxr is such a different person this stream omg :D

16:59:21
terawatthour: the most idiotic thing about westerners and their love for foreign cuisine is indochina and spiders which were consumed during biggest famines just to survive and now treated as a local snack by tourists who dont know their real story

16:59:22
thdxr: all of my meat comes from tiny farms, it's way more expensive so it means we eat less but you can't say the animals aren't treated well

16:59:24
<transcript>: I finally got a new water bottle. And my P isn't dark anymore. That's good, dax. That's good. That your P is not dark.

16:59:32

16:59:32
<transcript>: what

16:59:35
<transcript>: What? I didn't even try.

16:59:42
goodgrandpaa: @bananscode Didn't you claim that they were meant to be eaten? :P

16:59:43
bananscode: that zoom and pan effect you did on keyboard is ken burns effect

16:59:46
<transcript>: I use rust. By the way, there I went. A horse has always been too useful to eat, as are dogs. Cows taste better. Cows are useless except for eating.

16:59:47
<transcript>: I mean.

16:59:47
<transcript>: what is useful

16:59:49
<transcript>: What is useful.

16:59:51
dmmulroy: I'm in a fortunate position that the majority of my red meat comes from venison that I hunt myself

16:59:56
<transcript>: What do you mean by cows are useless except for eating. They're useless to humans. I don't know.

17:00:03
<transcript>: It's like me being like this person's useless to me. I'm going to kill him and eat them.

17:00:11
caelic01: Yeah, my cousin was pretty useless so we ate him

17:00:19
<transcript>: I don't think you can do that. I don't think you can just decide that some species of living things aren't useful, so they're okay to eat. I mean, we have decided. I guess we can. We can. And we did. I just don't know if it's right. I don't know.

17:00:19
<transcript>: i really don't

17:00:24
thdxr: @less

<transcript>: I really don't hold strong opinions on this, but the more I hear people try and justify why we eat some animals and donate the others. The more I have a passionate stance on it that it's all just kind of like, really, you're trying. You're reaching. You're trying real hard. But I don't know. Horse meat is yummy. You can buy it in Western countries. Welcome to Chat prezis. It's maybe the strangest first message. Anyone.

17:00:58
<transcript>: Me and the cows voted. We agree. Beef is delicious.

17:01:01
<transcript>: Can't we all just eat sugar all the time? There you go.

17:01:08
<transcript>: Imagine everyone coming in from seeing a thumbnail of coding to just hear a combo about killing and eating dogs and cows.

17:01:08
<transcript>: so

17:01:10
<transcript>: So true.

17:01:10
haliphax: but like in france, they'll eat horse, and americans are pretty freaked out by that

17:01:12

<transcript>: To set up their usefulness, and we'll stop eating them. In adam's world, cows wouldn't even exist. He's basically advocating for genocide. That's right. Welcome to Chat. No, thank you for the following. No, neither. Nothing just happened. Did I not just hear something? Okay, whatever.

17:01:26
<transcript>: thought i heard

17:01:28
<transcript>: Thought I heard something.

17:01:28
<transcript>: can't

17:01:38
<transcript>: Can't we all just eat sugar, me and the cows vote. Okay, it's so easy living in a country where most people are vegetarian anyway, my body auto rejects meat and stuff. Even chicken. Yeah. Mayhole.

17:01:44
<transcript>: I hear that about certain parts of Asia, that you guys are already vegetarian. That's pretty cool.

17:01:44
<transcript>: india

17:01:51
<transcript>: India. Is it India or other places? Cows would be extinct otherwise if we did not eat them. Same with chickens.

17:01:53
goodgrandpaa: @thdxr I appreciate this standpoint more than global scale farming/production ngl.

17:01:58
<transcript>: I don't know. Would you rather be tortured and then killed in a slaughterhouse or not exist.

17:01:58
<transcript>: i think

17:02:01

gitpush_gitpaid: i dont wanna exist now

17:02:21
<transcript>: Maybe. I don't know. The burden of proof lies upon a person making empirically, unfalsifiable claims. I don't know that. I don't know. This is where I am not an intellectual. I don't know how to understand that sense. The burden of proof. Oh, okay. The burden of proof lies. So the person who's responsible for proving their statement is the person who's making.

17:02:21
<transcript>: empir

17:02:24
<transcript>: Empirically unfalsifiable claims.

17:02:24
<transcript>: unfalsif

17:02:28
<transcript>: Unfalsifiable means you cannot prove them to be false.

17:02:32
<transcript>: Is that me? Or is that other people bannons? That's what I need to know.

17:02:36
<transcript>: Dax is such a different person. This stream. Omg.

17:02:56
<transcript>: Oh, my stream is so different from dexes. Yeah, because we're not actually programming. We're just talking about animal rights. I guess. Most idiotic thing about westerners and their love for foreign cuisine is indochina and spiders, which were consumed during biggest famines just to survive and now treated as a local snack by tourists who don't know their real story. Interesting. That sounds disgusting.

17:02:56
<transcript>: all of my meat comes

habdams: Cows, chicken and pigs live a terrible life

17:03:09
<transcript>: All of my meat comes from tiny farms. It's way more expensive. So it means we eat less. But you can't say that animals aren't treated well. Oh, I don't know. Yeah, they might be. The animals might be treated great. Didn't you claim that they were meant to be eaten.

17:03:09
<transcript>: that

17:03:14

17:03:15
<transcript>: Movie maker maybe.

17:03:22
<transcript>: I'm in a fortunate position that the majority of my red meat comes from venison, that I hunt myself.

17:03:22
<transcript>: oh well

17:03:25
realkingphilippe: Yes

17:03:27
<transcript>: Oh, well, that's totally different. I mean, you worked for it.

17:03:27
<transcript>: i do have

17:03:31
<transcript>: I do have like I feel like I have a little bit more.

17:03:46
<transcript>: Sympathy for thinking about people who used to live off the land and they had to Hunt down anything they ate. Seems better than what I know to be the truth of factory farming. And even what dax says is kind of getting at that. There's a difference.

17:03:46
<transcript>: in

17:03:50
goodgrandpaa: +1 on that take.

17:03:54
<transcript>: In the just horrible, just inhumane things that we do in Western cultures to raise enough cattle for American.

17:03:54
kryotoboi: Thanks to the stream, now I am having second thoughts about the steak sitting in front me

17:04:02
<transcript>: Versus small farm. You raise your own cattle, your own goats, whatever. And you eat them.

terawatthour: i think a debate about capital punishment would be fun after this one...

17:04:07
<transcript>: It's a very different thing. I get it. My cousin was pretty useless. So we ate him.

17:04:11
<transcript>: Sorry. I must have a dark sense of humor, because that was funny to me.

17:04:15
<transcript>: Okay.

thdxr: domain broker called me, raad.com is  $35K should I do it

17:04:20

aj_stuyvenberg: @thdxr tell them you got another bid for $35,001 and see where it goes.

17:05:12
<transcript>: I fully agree that the entire world would be better off if we ate way less meat. Yeah.

17:05:12
<transcript>: we haven't even talked about

17:05:15
<transcript>: we're just

17:05:17
lesabotsy: in the end eating plants is the most sustainable way

17:05:23
<transcript>: We're just talking about animal rights. There's, like, eight different reasons that eating plant based is a pretty good thing.

17:05:23
<transcript>: i'm

17:05:26
<transcript>: I'm just saying, I'm not saying I'm better than anybody.

17:05:26
<transcript>: i'm just saying

17:05:28
<transcript>: I'm just saying, I think 2030 years from now.

17:05:33
<transcript>: The trend continues and more people eat plant based because.

17:05:33
<transcript>: it's more sust

17:05:35
goodgrandpaa: I actually can't have dairy that make, super intolerant.

17:05:36
thdxr: nooo don't get into ecological impact

17:05:39
<transcript>: It's more sustainable. It's better for your bodies. It's better for animals.

17:05:42
<transcript>: Just kind of better. I'm sorry.

17:05:44
<transcript>: I get it.

goodgrandpaa: @thdxr LUL

17:06:48
<transcript>: i get

17:06:49
manbravegg: @Lesabotsy cheaper, that is for damn sure. The issue is how do people get all the nutrients they need to thrive optimally. That is always the question that all the health advocates lean on to preserve meat as a source for specific macro nutrients.

17:06:50
<transcript>: I get real.

17:06:54
<transcript>: Opinionated about things.

17:07:09
<transcript>: Plus one on that take.

17:07:15
<transcript>: Thanks to the stream. Now I am having second thoughts about the steak sitting in front of me.

17:07:17
<transcript>: Cryo. It's a process.

17:07:19
<transcript>: Like no one decision.

17:07:27
<transcript>: Is going to end us all. It's all the little tiny collective decisions over long periods of time.

17:07:27
<transcript>: so

17:07:31
<transcript>: So eat your steak. But I do encourage people to look into it.

17:07:35
<transcript>: We just got curious. And they got more curious.

17:07:35
<transcript>: and then

17:07:37
<transcript>: And then one thing led to another.

17:07:54
<transcript>: So is this a date.

17:07:54
<transcript>: it's a date

17:07:58

haliphax: so kill people but not animals, GOT IT

17:08:06
<transcript>: Animals are food. Nature is violent. But it does not mean we should raise animals in horrible conditions in order to eat them. There's a right balance of fine. That's what I think. Lesa.

17:08:07

haliphax: I SEE HOW IT IS, ADAM

17:08:12
aj_stuyvenberg: @thdxr lol shit

17:08:15

lesabotsy: @ManBraveGG well I have no idea but we humans are smart if we want solutions, we could probably find some. The problem is we dont want to find said solutions.

17:08:24
<transcript>: Like it's made for baby cows.

17:08:30
<transcript>: It's literally like Baby Cow Growth formula.

17:08:30
<transcript>: it's not

17:08:33
<transcript>: It's not meant for human consumption. I'm sorry.

17:08:33
<transcript>: just not

17:08:34
<transcript>: Just not.

17:08:34
<transcript>: and our bodies don't like

17:08:36
<transcript>: And our bodies don't like it.

17:08:43
<transcript>: This is getting so opinionated. I don't have these opinions. I don't have opinions on, like, tech, but apparently I have them on food.

<transcript>: will he talk

17:09:13
manbravegg: @Lesabotsy I would love to find a meal I could eat once a day that would give me all the nutrients I need. This way I can spend less time eating and more time doing fun things.

17:09:15
<transcript>: Will he talk for hours now? No.

17:09:15
<transcript>: i mean

17:09:18

17:09:36
<transcript>: soil

17:09:45
<transcript>: Soil quality has degraded such that there's not B twelve found in soil. I guess these days I don't know. So most people get their B twelve from meat.

17:09:51
vapor__dev: @thdxr mark sisson lives in miami....just sayin...ambush

17:09:53
<transcript>: So we do supplement B twelve, but your body can store B twelve and have reserves of it so you don't have to. It's not like a huge risk.

I guess like capital punishment doesn't like it's not something I see much or have it's not like it never has, literally never impacted my life. Does that mean I shouldn't have an opinion on it? No. Maybe I'm being lazy. Maybe.

<transcript>: She's just really into it. She reads all the papers, mostly like the papers around human health and diet.

17:13:00
thdxr: Is your wife a nutritionist?

17:13:01
<transcript>: We all want to see Adam struggling with Colin. Yeah. I don't know if this is going to be any better than our conversation.

17:13:01
vapor__dev: i've seen a slaughterhouse....this kotlin codebase

17:13:03
<transcript>: But.

17:13:03
<transcript>: get push

17:13:05
<transcript>: Get pushed.

17:13:05
<transcript>: this is what happens

17:13:11
terawatthour: kiwi type kiwi if you agree with adam on animal rights and kiwi if you dont

17:13:12
<transcript>: This is what happens when I stream in the afternoon. Apparently, we're streaming the afternoon. Suddenly we started talking about politics.

17:13:16
goodgrandpaa: Rick has been rollin' us for a long while today

17:13:16
<transcript>: And diet and ecology.

17:13:18
<transcript>: I literally said to myself.

17:13:18
<transcript>: going to have just

17:13:20
kiwifromearth: kiwi

17:13:23
<transcript>: Going to have just have Adam in the background while I work, and then we're getting into cap punishment and diet. Yeah.

17:13:25
goodgrandpaa: @TeraWattHour LUL

17:13:26
<transcript>: I don't know how this happened.

17:13:30
<transcript>: Kiwi, thank you. Thank you for bringing us back Kiwi.

17:13:31
terawatthour: @kiwifromearth understandable, have a great day

17:13:39
<transcript>: Dax. Why did you repeat that message? Why? Why do you do this to me? I've seen a slaughterhouse as kotlin code base. Yeah, exactly.

17:13:47
kiwifromearth: @kiwifromearth yes

17:13:49
<transcript>: The Kiwi thing. Kiwi, you're quickly becoming one of my favorite people on the internet.

17:13:53
<transcript>: I'm following you now on twitch. Okay.

17:13:55
<transcript>: Here we go.

17:14:05
<transcript>: Rick Roll has been rolling. Let's see if this button still works. Let's see if dax's button still works. Sin question.

17:14:10
<transcript>: Does it work? It's been running for a while. We're going to really put it to the test.

17:14:14
terawatthour: new word unlocked: yes

17:14:14
<transcript>: Did it do it correct. Did it do it.

17:14:17
<transcript>: I feel like it should have disappeared by now.

17:14:20
<transcript>: Uhoh.

17:14:21
overra_dev: kiwi infinity stream when

17:14:28
<transcript>: New word unlocked. Yes. What's this? Dax, what is this? Publish results. Oh, I have to say when it's the correct answer.

17:14:32
<transcript>: Also, I need to start handling these messages. Okay.

17:14:35
thdxr: @adamdotdev I disabled the disappearing

17:14:36
<transcript>: Got IBS event.

17:14:36
<transcript>: not to be

17:14:42
<transcript>: Not to be confused with ibs, which you might have if you eat non plant food. I'm sorry. I'm just kidding.

17:14:42
<transcript>: you disabled

17:14:46
gitpush_gitpaid: this is how cults begin. lets watch some coding in kotlin -> lets storm the capitol for animal rights

17:14:47
<transcript>: You disabled the disappearing. Oh, okay. Got you cool. That's handy actually.

17:14:48
goodgrandpaa: LUL

17:14:56
<transcript>: So thank you so much for the follow. Cornell and jxn. I appreciate those follows.

17:14:59
thdxr: I have ibs from plant food

17:15:11
<transcript>: I need to handle these new shapes. I have IBS from plant food. This is how colts begin. Let's watch some coding in kotlin. Let's storm the capital for animal rides.

17:15:14
terawatthour: @gitpush_gitpaid im just getting my popcorn ready for that trump arrest and capitol v2

17:15:14
thdxr: scamming me into having IBS

17:15:17
<transcript>: Get push. You're another one of my favorite people.

17:15:26
<transcript>: I'm just getting my popcorn ready for that Trump arrest in Capital V. Two. What's going on with that? Is there something happening.

17:15:27
vapor__dev: lold so hard. "i dunno about capital punishment" (goofy sound from new follower) "fuzzy cheeto welcome to chat!"

17:15:31
<transcript>: Did I hear Trump? Something about Trump getting arrested or something.

17:15:35
thdxr: LOL

17:15:38
gitpush_gitpaid: @gitpush_gitpaid lol

17:15:40
<transcript>: I don't know about capital punishment. Fuzzy. Tina, what was that? That's funny. That is funny.

17:15:43
goodgrandpaa: @thdxr Wait, have you actually tried any impossible products?

17:15:45
<transcript>: I don't think anyone named fuzzy cheeto came in today. I would have remembered that name, though.

17:15:53
<transcript>: Have you actually tried any impossible products? Oh, you're time to dax. Okay, I'm going to keep doing something. So with this message right here. What is this.

17:15:53
<transcript>: results

17:15:55
<transcript>: Results.

17:15:55
<transcript>: question id

17:15:59
thdxr: I wouldn't put impossible meat in my body

17:16:01
<transcript>: Question ID. This is Game Question results. There's nothing in the results.

17:16:03
<transcript>: What's that about.

17:16:06
goodgrandpaa: @thdxr Fair enough LUL

17:16:07
kiwifromearth: are there any other breatharians in the chat?

17:16:10
<transcript>: What is that about? So I have to send. I probably have to send something to him.

17:16:15
thdxr: too much weird stuff in it

17:16:15
<transcript>: Dex. You want to tell me what it is.

17:16:15
<transcript>: just give me

17:16:17
overra_dev: it not that difficult

17:16:17
<transcript>: Just give me a high level real quick.

17:16:17
<transcript>: when i get the

17:16:19
thdxr: I eat pretty simple food

17:16:20
<transcript>: When I get the ibs question.

17:16:23
<transcript>: I then need to make a request to answer.

17:16:23
<transcript>: right

17:16:24
<transcript>: Right.

17:16:26
thdxr: minus larabars

17:16:31
terawatthour: @thdxr keep those great thoughts going and i might try the sst framework

17:16:34
<transcript>: Are there any other breathtarians.

17:16:34
<transcript>: in

17:16:37
<transcript>: In the Chat. What's a bretharian.

17:16:41
<transcript>: What is that.

17:16:44
<transcript>: I hate pretty simple food minus Lar bars.

17:16:46
gitpush_gitpaid: people who like eating mints

17:16:48
thdxr: yeah the endpoint is "game_answer"

17:16:50
goodgrandpaa: Inedia (Latin for 'fasting') or breatharianism is the claimed ability for a person to live without consuming food, and in some cases water.

17:16:54
overra_dev: they underestimate the possibilities

17:16:59
<transcript>: People who like eating mints. The endpoint is game answer. Okay, so I need to call game answer posts. I need to post to game answer. Probably.

17:17:05
<transcript>: Is that accurate? Let's see here. We've got a stream service. We're going to have function.

17:17:07
<transcript>: Function.

17:17:09
kubahasek: wait so SST is for teaching you on deploying stuff on AWS?

17:17:11
thdxr: yeah post

17:17:13
<transcript>: Answer or get answer. What did you say? Game answer.

17:17:13
<transcript>: we'll just

17:17:15
<transcript>: We'll just call it answer.

17:17:19
<transcript>: Where is that going? To go? Up here. Api service up here.

17:17:19
<transcript>: so it's going to

17:17:21
<transcript>: So it's going to be function.

17:17:23
<transcript>: Answer.

17:17:25
<transcript>: Call.

17:17:29
<transcript>: Is it a post? Yeah. Post. Okay. Post.

17:17:33
<transcript>: Stream. It's going to be.

17:17:35
terawatthour: the only fun thing about kotlin is its function keyword

17:17:36
<transcript>: Game answer.

17:17:36
<transcript>: okay

17:17:37
<transcript>: Okay.

17:17:39
<transcript>: And.

17:17:39
<transcript>: it's going to

17:17:42
<transcript>: It's going to take in what.

17:17:45
goodgrandpaa: @TeraWattHour I love that humor

17:17:48
<transcript>: The only fun thing about Colin is it's a function keyword. Exactly.

17:17:48
thdxr: yeah it's a post, check game.ts for the shape of the input

17:17:55
<transcript>: So I need to just look at the let me just look at the repo.

17:17:58
<transcript>: Just see what this looks like.

17:18:01
kubahasek: i don't have much of an opinion on vegetarian being, but I wanted to try solely for the health/fitness stuff. haven't yet though

17:18:02
<transcript>: Stream event so let's look up.

17:18:02
<transcript>: what

17:18:07
thdxr: it's probably going to fail because of auth though...can steal the token from the producer app local storage

17:18:09
<transcript>: What was it called? Game Answer? Here we go. So it takes in Game Answer questions.

17:18:09
<transcript>: let's see

17:18:11
<transcript>: Let's see.

17:18:19
<transcript>: A game. Id. A question, ID. And an answer. They're all strings. Okay, so that's what I pass in.

17:18:27
<transcript>: It's probably going to say because of us though can steal the token from the producer app local storage oh boy.

17:18:32
<transcript>: Check game TS for the shape. Okay. Yeah. So I'm going to have to auth.

17:18:40
<transcript>: Or you're saying, just steal the token. Where do I put the token in a header? I don't know how to do that in here. I'm going to have to figure that out.

17:18:43
<transcript>: Headers.

17:18:46
<transcript>: Add.

17:18:55
thdxr: Authorization: Bearer <token>

17:19:06
<transcript>: We'll figure it out. Hey, by the way, if anybody wants me to read a tweet, I'm going to do Twitter time in a little bit. And the way that works is you just paste Tweet links into my chat and then they'll get queued up for me to open later. So do that. If you have Tweets authorization bearer token. Got it. I got to figure out where I can put.

17:19:11
<transcript>: Where I can put http headers.

17:19:14
<transcript>: Base URL.

17:19:16
<transcript>: Builder.

17:19:16
<transcript>: let's look

17:19:19
<transcript>: Let's look it up, retrofit.

17:19:23
thdxr: https://twitter.com/TailsOnRails/status/1641829057972035585?t=c7y2_HhqRDwVu7usHi_Riw&s=19

17:19:24
<transcript>: Do this. How do I add? How do I add.

17:19:24
<transcript>: headers

17:19:25
<transcript>: Headers to.

17:19:25
<transcript>: or how do i

17:19:27
<transcript>: Or how do I add.

17:19:27
<transcript>: an

17:19:28
cmgriffing: https://twitter.com/cmgriffing/status/1641541298082713603

<transcript>: An authorization.

17:19:31
<transcript>: Header.

17:19:31
<transcript>: to

17:19:34
<transcript>: To a network request.

17:19:39
<transcript>: Using retrofit.

17:19:43
cmgriffing: a little shameless promotion

17:19:47
privann: Hey @adamdotdev how u doin

17:19:50
<transcript>: Let's see. It's probably going to say, oh, I already read that don't have much of an opinion on vegetarian being, but I wanted to try solely for the health fitness stuff. Haven't yet though, yet. So what I would say is.

17:19:50
<transcript>: we started

17:19:51
privann: hey @cmgriffing how u doin? :D

17:20:04
<transcript>: We started eating plant based simply because pravan is here. What's going on? Pravan. How are you, Griffin? With a Tweet? No worries about shameless. Promotion, please. Shamelessly. Promote all you want.

17:20:09
basileus__: ISILDURRRR

17:20:12
privann: All good good, I am about to write some rust for a while :D

17:20:13
goodgrandpaa: https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen/status/1641499089199063052?s=20

17:20:15
<transcript>: We started out eating plant based for health, like just for our own personal bodies and feeling like that was the best thing for us to do. And then it just kind of turned into lots of other things.

17:20:15
<transcript>: what

17:20:25
<transcript>: What is all this? Oh, my goodness. Do I have to seriously add more library? Now? I don't have to add more libraries just to do headers. Do I surely not.

17:20:25
<transcript>: yeah

17:20:31
<transcript>: Yeah. It kind of turned into, like an appreciation for the animal right side. The ecological impact. Side.

17:20:31
<transcript>: dax now

17:20:36
<transcript>: Dax. Now I just have to know. Dax, what is your argument? You're saying? If we all just ate more meat, we would.

17:20:36
<transcript>: be more

17:20:42
<transcript>: Be more kind to the planet. Is that what you're trying to tell me? I get the factory. Farming is a real issue.

17:20:45
thdxr: I don't have an argument, I like how you eat

17:20:45
cmgriffing: howdy @privann

17:20:52
<transcript>: It's not eating meat. It's that we eat too much meat or that we produce too much. I don't even have an argument. I like how you eat. No, you don't. You do not.

17:20:52
<transcript>: dax

17:20:57
<transcript>: Dax. Now you're just. Is this the thing where you say yes to somebody who's arguing with you? Is that what that was.

17:20:57
<transcript>: i

17:21:03
cmgriffing: yes

17:21:05
<transcript>: I know you do that. You've told me your tactics when somebody gets all upset with you. And you're just like, yes, I know you.

17:21:05
goodgrandpaa: Almost wholesome Kappa

17:21:07
<transcript>: I know you.

17:21:10
vapor__dev: new thing is you just respond "!"

17:21:10
<transcript>: Almost wholesome.

17:21:10
<transcript>: did i almost

17:21:12
<transcript>: Did I almost do something wholesome.

17:21:12
<transcript>: what

17:21:14
<transcript>: What did I do.

17:21:16
thdxr: the only thing I disagree with you on is the health negatives of meat

17:21:21
<transcript>: Okay auth token http client builder add interceptor what.

17:21:21
<transcript>: author

17:21:25
<transcript>: Authorization. Interceptor? Are you serious.

17:21:25
<transcript>: this is

17:21:27
<transcript>: This is to add a header.

17:21:30
goodgrandpaa: I meant dax being almost wholesome lol

17:21:31
<transcript>: Oh man? People peace? People.

17:21:33
basileus__: @thdxr BASED

17:21:34
<transcript>: Kotlin not going to make it.

17:21:38
thdxr: the philosophy around how you and I eat are 90% the same

17:21:42
kubahasek: yeah, i saw the documentary on Netflix which made me real interested, considering I am a pretty active person and it can help with fitness abilities

17:21:42
<transcript>: This is what? What's? An authorization interceptor. I have to write this to add a header.

17:21:42
<transcript>: are you

17:21:44
<transcript>: Are you serious? Right now.

17:21:44
<transcript>: what i have

17:21:46
zol0: that is gross

17:21:47
<transcript>: What I have to make a class.

17:21:59
<transcript>: The only thing new thing is that you just respond with exclamation. Mark, the only thing I disagree with you on is the health negatives of meat. Health negatives of meat. Yeah. Okay. Well, I don't know if we disagree.

17:22:01
<transcript>: I think.

17:22:01
kryotoboi: Yes words like that make it sound like you're doing something serious

17:22:03
<transcript>: Not being a pure.

17:22:03
<transcript>: pureist probably

17:22:06
<transcript>: Pureist probably makes no difference in terms of health.

17:22:11
<transcript>: You have to eat 100% plant based or you're screwing your health.

17:22:11
<transcript>: it's just like most

17:22:31
<transcript>: It's just like most people eat way too much in the way of animal products. And so I guess when I do speak with people about this stuff, it's generally like, yeah, you should stop eating meat because they just eat so much. And they'll say, like, oh, well, I'll just cut back to a reasonable amount, and it still won't be in a reasonable amount. So it's like to me, try stopping altogether because that's the best chance.

17:22:31
<transcript>: that

17:22:33
terawatthour: https://twitter.com/TheOnion/status/1446822839412215810

17:22:36
<transcript>: That you'll not eat just enormous amounts of it every week. But.

17:22:36
<transcript>: i don't

17:22:40
goodgrandpaa: @TeraWattHour Love that account.

17:22:48
<transcript>: I don't think that you actually gain health benefits by being a purist. So I guess that's what I would say. The only thing I disagree. Okay, I meant dax being almost wholesome. Oh, dax almost. Yeah. He didn't call me a scammer. He made a sentence where he didn't call me a scammer.

17:22:50
<transcript>: Bass.

17:22:50
<transcript>: the

17:22:55
<transcript>: The philosophy around how you and I eat are 90% the same. I believe that.

17:22:55
<transcript>: it's like less

17:22:58
<transcript>: It's like less junk, less.

17:22:59
vapor__dev: diet is so friggin controversial, besides eating non-processed, basically the only super definitive thing is "people who eat less calories over lifetime live longer" don't @ me bro

17:23:00
terawatthour: @GoodGrandPaa the onion is an icon

17:23:14
<transcript>: Processed foods. I saw the documentary on Netflix, which made me really interested, considering I'm a pretty active person and it can help with fitness abilities. Yeah. No. You look at like professional athletes. And there's like a big movement in professional sports towards plant based eating or just like more plant based eating.

17:23:14
<transcript>: like

17:23:17
thdxr: the 10% different is that adam is fatter than me

17:23:20
<transcript>: Like higher intake of vegetables and fruits and lower intake.

17:23:24
thdxr: and therefore I will live longer

17:23:25
basileus__: Diet is controversial because there's a crapton of money involved and it's all psyops

17:23:27
<transcript>: Of acid producing animal products. It's science. It's just science.

17:23:32
<transcript>: That is gross. Yes. Words like that make it sound like you're doing something serious.

17:23:36
<transcript>: What was the word.

17:23:36
<transcript>: that i

17:23:41
<transcript>: That I said I was doing something serious. Twitter, The Onion. Thank you for sending me a tweet.

17:23:42
gitpush_gitpaid: can statmuse prove that more athletes are eating plants based meals?

17:23:54
<transcript>: The diet is so freaking controversial because eating non processed. Basically, the only super definitive thing is people who eat less calories over lifetime live longer. Don't at me. That's so true. Actually, Alan, you want to get into, like real bass takes.

17:24:01
<transcript>: Like basically limiting calorie caloric intake. That's like the big thing, right.

17:24:05
goodgrandpaa: @TeraWattHour No kidding either. I watched some of the youtube videos, like the fat kid that protected himself from bullying by wearing a shit at the pool LUL

17:24:05
<transcript>: That's why big people don't live as long generally because they eat more.

17:24:08
<transcript>: I saw this other thing that talked about how.

17:24:08
<transcript>: we basically

17:24:11
<transcript>: We basically have a limited number of heartbeats.

17:24:14
<transcript>: Most living things have.

17:24:14
<transcript>: a range

17:24:16
<transcript>: A range of their heartbeats.

17:24:16
<transcript>: that

17:24:29
<transcript>: That an elephant will never have more than this many heartbeats. It's like they fit within a very narrow range. And if you think about that, it's just about like your physical fitness directly impacts how much your heart beats, literally.

17:24:30
<transcript>: Like.

17:24:30
<transcript>: a more fit

17:24:35
<transcript>: A more fit person, a more healthy individual has a lower.

17:24:35
<transcript>: resting heart

17:24:37
<transcript>: Resting heart rate right.

17:24:37
<transcript>: that's interesting

17:24:40
gitpush_gitpaid: limited number of heartbeats? i think thats bs. so jogging/walking will cause me to die earlier?

17:24:42
<transcript>: That's interesting to me, but yeah, caloric intake is like most of it. Probably.

17:24:45
goodgrandpaa: wait.. @TeraWattHour Shirt** not shit..

17:24:50
<transcript>: And that's the problem in America is we just have so many calories, they're so cheap. And it's so easy in this toxic food environment to eat way too much.

17:24:50
<transcript>: that's not the case

17:24:53
<transcript>: That's not the case everywhere, but definitely in the us.

17:24:58
kryotoboi: I say eat sugar more. It gives you energy. It makes you fat , which keeps you warm during winters. So its a good thing.

17:24:59
terawatthour: @TeraWattHour its sad that in the current era things that they have done arent really that unthinkable

17:24:59
thdxr: jogging lowers your resting heart rate so it might be lower when you jog

17:25:13
<transcript>: 10% different is that Adam is fatter than me. Ouch. Therefore, I will live longer. Ouch. I'm also taller. So yeah, you will probably live longer than me. Diet is controversial because there's a crap ton of money involved and it's all psyops. I totally agree with that. Bassfulius. Totally agree. Can samuels prove that more athletes are eating plants based meals? I don't know. Actually.

17:25:13
<transcript>: we don't have access

17:25:13
vapor__dev: "im also taller" oooh man that was slick

17:25:18
goodgrandpaa: @TeraWattHour Right!

17:25:21
<transcript>: We don't have access to that data right now, but that might be fun. I watch some of the YouTube videos, like the fat Kid that protects himself from bullying by wearing a shirt at the pool.

17:25:21
<transcript>: what was that

17:25:23
cmgriffing: lol the heart beat argument is what people use to argue against cardio exercise too though

17:25:23
<transcript>: What was that? Youtube video.

17:25:29
<transcript>: Limited number of heartbeats I think that's bs so jogging walking will cause me to die earlier.

17:25:36
<transcript>: I think the idea was that you send more time resting, and if you're more active, even though you're peaking your heart rate.

17:25:36
<transcript>: for that

17:25:38
<transcript>: For that active period.

17:25:38

goodgrandpaa: @adamdotdev Video by the onion, satire content.

17:25:56
<transcript>: That you end up beating less over your lifetime. I think that's the idea. So the more active I remember hearing about professional swimmers and how low their resting heart rates are. They're basically dead because they're just so fit. I don't know. I might be making all this up.

17:25:58
realmntwin: correct - jogging reduces your resting heart rate for the rest of the day

17:26:01
thdxr: no one's heart rate is lower than Keith Rabois

17:26:11

gitpush_gitpaid: "hey lets go fishing".... "na im trying to live longer"

17:26:37
<transcript>: Let's see. Oh, the onion. Yeah, it's getting less satirical as the world gets crazier. Jogging lowers your resting heart rate, so it might be lower when you jog. I'm also taller. Oh, that was slick. Was that a good one? Alan? Did I just get a little dig in? I didn't mean to, but I guess I kind of did. The heartbeat argument is what people used to argue against. Cardio exercise, too, though. Oh, well, that's not good. Yeah, you should definitely exercise.

terawatthour: @thdxr are you sure it was accidental? KEKW

17:26:57
<transcript>: Still reading. Welcome to Chat Real Minnesota Twin. Correct. Jogging reduces your resting heart rate for the rest of the day. Yeah, I think that's the idea. I think being more active the idea is that your heart will actually beat less over your lifetime if you're more active.

17:26:57
<transcript>: and

17:27:00
vapor__dev: @thdxr breh just take the rest of the day off from that one..

17:27:12
<transcript>: And that has something to do with lifespan. There was one study on it. It's probably not true, but it's interesting to think about that kind of stuff. And then there's other studies where they just literally are trying to correlate calorie intake to lifespan. And there's something to that.

<transcript>: 100% an Android native thing. Okay, so.

17:38:22
<transcript>: We did should have stuck with rack native. We did start with it.

17:38:22
<transcript>: the chance

17:38:27
<transcript>: The chance of him saying a foreign name correctly is less than the chance to win a MacBook.

17:38:27
<transcript>: it

17:38:32
<transcript>: It's true. I have a terrible problem with pronouncing names and things like that.

17:38:38
<transcript>: Should have stuck with Ragnative, but I like Colin. I'm sorry.

17:38:47
<transcript>: I'm not trying to make anyone feel bad for liking kotlin. I just can't believe to add a header. It should just be one line. I should have just been like dot add header and then added my header, but instead.

17:38:47
<transcript>: i

17:38:57
<transcript>: I had to do all this stuff. I had to import three new things. Five new things. Five new imports. I had to make a class and override something with.

basileus__: I can't bring myself to write anything except rust code

17:39:01
abunassertm: I’m starting with python do you have any advice

17:39:04
<transcript>: Polymorphism or whatever that is. The swimson. The. Vincent. Thank you for the follow. I appreciate that.

17:39:10
<transcript>: Let's see C. Sharp. Just try and execute curl directly. Probably less code. Yeah.

17:39:10
<transcript>: i

17:39:18
<transcript>: I can only imagine how impossible it is to start like an external process in kotlin. If this hard to add an authorization header.

17:39:18
<transcript>: c

17:39:22
<transcript>: C sharp. Really? It's not. I think. No, it's Colin.

17:39:22
<transcript>: bro

17:39:33
basileus__: @AbuNasserTM depends what you're trying to do: web dev, ML, something else?

17:39:36
comfybobatea: chanhWave

17:39:42
<transcript>: Bro. Go, David, welcome to Chat. Welcome, go, David. Welcome. Also comfy boba Tea and Abu nasser. Thank you for the follows. Oh, now I want boba tea. Look what you did. Comfy. Now on boba Tea. How about boba tea? Let's talk about boba Tea. Enough talking about plant based eating. Let's talk about boba tea.

17:39:42
<transcript>: yum

17:39:49
goodgrandpaa: Boba tea is fire.

17:39:56
comfybobatea: What's your favorite boba flavor?

17:40:02
<transcript>: Yum. I'm sorry I did get a little harsh on kotlin. It's not kotlin's fault. It's probably like the Android. It's probably Google's fault. Google sucked at everything. Google's so bad. Once I heard that dax has problems with Google yesterday. Now I realize how much I have problems with Google. And I'm just realizing cryo things are true. Follow. Wait. Crowd. Are you really not following me.

17:40:02
<transcript>: i feel like

17:40:08
<transcript>: I feel like I know you cryo? I feel like we're close. We've gotten to know each other over the years.

17:40:17
<transcript>: And not the years. But I feel like I don't know you're regular. Just you're evaluating. And I finally passed the test.

17:40:17
<transcript>: is that what

17:40:19
kryotoboi: Hahaha I followed you again

17:40:24
kryotoboi: Gaming the system

17:40:24
primesmustache: feels like axios interceptors

17:40:30
<transcript>: Is that what happened? Dr. Sevy is known for helping cure mini Illinois disease like AIDS, cancer, crazy things. He works with a lot of celebrities, too that allegedly died not too long after attempting to do. The document included them like nipsey and Lisa left eye. Whoa.

17:40:30
<transcript>: that sounds

17:40:32
<transcript>: That sounds interesting.

17:40:34
33nasser: Google does suck at everything

17:40:35
abunassertm: @basileus__ Actually i hope to build a game but not now till know how to build scripts

17:40:37
<transcript>: New follows. Thanks so much for all the follow thdxr. I really appreciate it.

17:40:37
<transcript>: i really do

17:40:43
<transcript>: I really do every single follow even that one. I appreciate them all. Let's see.

17:41:00
<transcript>: Is xamarin still popular? I don't know what is xamarin. I can't bring myself to write anything except russ code. That sounds so cool. Basilius. I wish I only wrote rust. I'm starting with Python. Do you have any advice? Abu nasser? Do I have any advice starting with Python.

17:41:05
<transcript>: No, I guess python is great to start with.

17:41:05
<transcript>: i think

17:41:20
<transcript>: I think just find something. You want to build something you want to build specifically, not something somebody tells you to build because then you don't want to build it and you'll have less incentive. Something you want to build and then build it. Comfy. Boba Tea welcome to my chat. Welcome, welcome.

17:41:35
<transcript>: This is what you try to do. Web wml. Something else? What's your favorite boba flare? My favorite is taro. I'm a big taro fan. Love it. I could use one right now. You followed me again. Gaming the system. Okay, not so cryo.

17:41:35
<transcript>: feels like

kiwifromearth: microtubules

17:41:48
<transcript>: Feels like axios interceptors. Google does suck at everything. We all agree. Google sucks. I hope to build a game, but not now, till. Okay, let's get back to it. So we did it. We added the authorization header. Everybody, I got to seal it from here.

17:41:49
abunassertm: Actually I don’t know how i build what i have and i hope too because its python

17:41:51
<transcript>: Let's see, steal it from.

17:41:51
<transcript>: here

17:41:56
terawatthour: @kiwifromearth dear lord what is going on

17:41:57
<transcript>: Here. What an interesting set of tabs. We've got Chad gbt, we got airtable.

17:42:00
<transcript>: This solid app that dax made.

17:42:00
<transcript>: existentialism

17:42:02
<transcript>: Existentialism Google.

17:42:09
<transcript>: This is an interesting stream. So now I need to grab the authorization token. Let's refresh the page and.

17:42:09
<transcript>: just look at

17:42:11
<transcript>: Just look at the Network tab.

17:42:20
<transcript>: There's a million requests. What am I supposed to do with that? This is what I'm going to do with that. I'm going to steal the token.

17:42:24
<transcript>: Stealing the token. Here we go.

17:42:29
<transcript>: There it is. Don't copy it. Don't write it into your whatever.

17:42:29
<transcript>: please

17:42:49
prom_ttv: I was following android studio course with kotlin, and recycler got me into puking. Why is list so hard to make??

17:42:49
<transcript>: Please don't steal this, okay? I feel pretty safe if someone figures out what that is, you earned it. You earned it. There's my auth token. Okay. Did I do the bearer thing? Yeah. Okay. So now we can make authorized requests to our api service. We have Game Answer, which we're going to call answer. It's going to call.

17:42:49
<transcript>: and return

17:42:58
<transcript>: And return what what shape is it going to return? Promptv welcome to Chat. I was following Android studio course with kotlin and recycler got me into puking.

17:42:58
<transcript>: why

17:43:10
<transcript>: Why is list so hard to make? Yeah, I don't know. I don't know, man. I'm not a huge fan so far of the kotlin experience. Kiwi from Earth microtubules Man. Kiwi, you're so cool.

17:43:10
<transcript>: i don't even know

17:43:17
<transcript>: I don't even know what that is, but you're so cool. Actually, I don't know how I build what I have, and I hope to because it's Python.

17:43:17
thdxr: kotlin is good! android dev is bad

17:43:23
<transcript>: Tara, could you understand Kiwi? I feel like I'd be cooler if I really understood Kiwi.

17:43:23
<transcript>: colin

17:43:31
<transcript>: Colin is good. Android dev is bad. Yeah, I think it's not kotlin's fault. I think it's Android, Android Studio and everything about Android.

17:43:31
<transcript>: okay

17:43:31
thdxr: someone should bring the solidjs signals model to native

17:43:35
<transcript>: Okay. So I need to figure out the shape. Let's see here.

17:43:35
<transcript>: when we do

17:43:44
thdxr: like leptos did

17:43:49
<transcript>: When we do a sample question, a few things are going to happen, man. It's just constantly streaming. Oh, yeah. The video. That makes sense. Let's clear these out. Let's send a question. And first of all, do we see that question come over? Yeah. One, two, three. Okay.

17:43:49
<transcript>: and now

17:43:51
<transcript>: And now.

17:43:52
<transcript>: Got ivs event.

17:43:52
<transcript>: game

17:43:52
goodgrandpaa: You should look into Dr Sebi in your free time, crazy interesting stories. He got sued by Supreme Court for false advertisement and had 77 people show up in support to prove his claims and he won LUL

17:43:57
<transcript>: Game. Question assigned. Why did we get it twice? That's interesting.

17:43:57
<transcript>: might be

17:44:01
<transcript>: Might be a bug, dax. It sent it twice on the ivs thing.

17:44:04
<transcript>: Unless you did it too.

17:44:06
terawatthour: there is a 50/50 change to guess correctly what kiwi is going to say next

17:44:07
thdxr: @adamdotdev hot reload is an issue on the frontend

17:44:09
<transcript>: Okay. Question answers. One, two, three.

17:44:10
dmmulroy: https://twitter.com/_jessicasachs/status/1641835362300358657?s=20

17:44:10
thdxr: it shows up twice

17:44:15
<transcript>: Hot reload is an issue on the front end. Oh, okay. It shows it first. Got it. No problem.

17:44:18
thdxr: but it only goes once over ivs

17:44:21
<transcript>: Game. Question closed. I need to look into that.

17:44:29
<transcript>: Game question close and there's no results. So that's like you got to get your answer in before that.

17:44:29
<transcript>: close

17:44:31
<transcript>: Close thing comes in right.

17:44:43
thdxr: yeah idk if the app even needs to know that it's closed, sending it for now

17:44:44
<transcript>: Okay. And then when I say publish results. Oh, but I don't know. Does the client have anywhere an example of making the call? You just told me to look at the shape, didn't you? Yeah, you did. Shows up twice. Okay.

17:44:44
<transcript>: i think i know what

17:44:47
<transcript>: I think I know what to do here. I need to make.

17:44:47
<transcript>: a model let's go

17:44:49
<transcript>: A model. Let's go to this.

17:44:49
<transcript>: go to

17:44:50
<transcript>: Go to.

17:44:52
<transcript>: Declaration.

17:44:55
<transcript>: I'm learning how to do stuff. Watch out.

17:44:55
<transcript>: okay

17:44:59
<transcript>: Okay, stream. Now we're going to have a new model.

17:45:02
lesabotsy: kotlin the language is good, tooling sucks as for any JVM languages ...

17:45:06
<transcript>: A new model. Let's go into models here. I'm going to say new.

17:45:09
<transcript>: Kotlin class file. We're going to call this.

17:45:13
<transcript>: Answer.

17:45:19
<transcript>: Thank you so much. Prom TTV for that follow. I see you. I appreciate you.

17:45:23
<transcript>: Let's see stream just like this.

17:45:30
<transcript>: We're going to say this one's called answer. And the shape of it. This is actually what I'm going to pass in.

17:45:30
<transcript>: to the

17:45:40
<transcript>: To the api, and it's going to have a shape that looks like I saw it somewhere. Where did I see it's? Probably in here. Here. Game. Id. Question ID. Answer ID.

17:45:40
<transcript>: okay

17:45:41
<transcript>: Okay.

17:45:44
<transcript>: So let's do this.

17:45:49
<transcript>: Game ID. Game ID. Is a string.

17:45:52
<transcript>: Question ID.

17:45:52
<transcript>: it's also

17:46:00
<transcript>: It's also a string. And what was the last thing? Don't remember? Have a very short attention span, don't I or a memory.

17:46:00
<transcript>: the id

17:46:04
<transcript>: The ids are capitalized answer. Okay.

17:46:04
<transcript>: answer val

17:46:09
<transcript>: Answer. Val answer is also a string. Okay, so that is our answer.

17:46:09
<transcript>: is

17:46:10
<transcript>: Is that the right.

17:46:10
<transcript>: yeah

17:46:11
astrojules: ooo kotlin

17:46:16
<transcript>: Yeah. We'll go with that answer. Is the class name. So let's go back here.

17:46:16
<transcript>: no

17:46:18
<transcript>: No question, model no.

17:46:18
<transcript>: where was

17:46:27
<transcript>: Where was that? Oh, I just want to do control o so bad and to get back to where I was main active? Here we go. Maybe.

17:46:27
<transcript>: not

17:46:28
<transcript>: Not.

17:46:35
<transcript>: No. Where was I? Where was that? Anybody know.

17:46:38
<transcript>: Answer, adapter, no.

17:46:38
<transcript>: main

17:46:41
<transcript>: Main view model. Here we go. Okay.

17:46:41
thdxr: can't you stop using android studio now and use neovim?

17:46:43
goodgrandpaa: Oh this is Java 2.0 right?

17:46:48
<transcript>: Call. So you're going to pass in here. Oh, interesting. I don't actually know how to do this. How do I type.

17:46:48
<transcript>: we'll just

17:46:50
terawatthour: dear lord why does this thing have so many keywords?

17:46:51
<transcript>: We'll just try it. Let's try.

17:46:51
<transcript>: answer

17:46:52
<transcript>: Answer.

17:46:57
<transcript>: Like that. And then it responds with what.

17:47:01
primesmustache: you should do a lang tierlist

17:47:03
<transcript>: Can't you stop using Android Studio now and use Neovim? I guess I could. Oh, yeah, maybe I could.

17:47:03
<transcript>: yeah maybe

17:47:05
<transcript>: Yeah. Maybe I could.

17:47:09
<transcript>: Maybe maybe I could.

17:47:09
<transcript>: i would

17:47:14
<transcript>: I would have to put it somewhere in here or. No, I'll just open it. Let's see.

17:47:15
thdxr: I distracted adam!

17:47:22
<transcript>: Let's do this. Push the.

pudottapommin: Rightclick file in AS and there should be copy path

17:48:34
goodgrandpaa: @Kryotoboi I can give you a file with about 11.5k lines!

17:49:36
<transcript>: okay

17:49:41
<transcript>: Okay, cool. Now we can do stuff in neo of them. At least that's nice, I guess.

17:49:48
<transcript>: Build what? I don't know anything about this. Where is it? Custom ui quiz demo. Here we go.

17:49:48
<transcript>: here we go

17:49:53
<transcript>: Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Job. Amazon. Ibs. Oh, my God. What in the world.

17:49:55
<transcript>: Why is this so bad.

17:49:55
<transcript>: i

17:50:08
<transcript>: I'm sorry I keep making fun of it, but it's just so bad. I don't understand how people do this every day. Okay, models, we'll open up our answer model. Okay, so here we are.

17:50:08
<transcript>: we got

17:50:15
<transcript>: We got answer. I need another response. Nothing in response. Okay, cool. So can I just delete that.

17:50:15
astrojules: oh Android LUL

17:50:21
<transcript>: Let's do that. Call. What is it? Call manual entry. Okay.

17:50:21
<transcript>: that keyboard

17:50:27
<transcript>: That keyboard sounds so good. Yeah, it does. I should use it more. I should actually type more. People would probably enjoy the stream. More.

17:50:30
lesabotsy: Never owned a mac but why the f*** MacOS has grep? Can't they make their own closed source grep instead of stealing

17:50:31
<transcript>: Do a laying tier list. I think that was done right. That was done yesterday.

17:50:34
<transcript>: That was done.

17:50:34
<transcript>: yesterday

17:50:35
<transcript>: Yesterday.

17:50:49
<transcript>: So I don't know if that works, if I can just do the call thing I guess let's go back to Android Studio. Thanks so much for the follow sentient machine.

17:50:53
<transcript>: Cynthia. Machine machine.

17:50:53
<transcript>: called

17:50:55
<transcript>: Called does not work.

17:50:55
<transcript>: one type

17:50:59
<transcript>: One type so it has to have a T. Can it be void.

17:51:03
<transcript>: Is void setup.

17:51:03
<transcript>: in

17:51:06
<transcript>: In just like that call void. Okay.

17:51:12
<transcript>: So I go back to that because I don't have Neil vim doesn't have like kotlin language server, I guess.

17:51:12
<transcript>: or

17:51:13

17:51:16
basileus__: @Lesabotsy it's not GNU grep, I'm pretty sure

17:53:03

17:53:14
<transcript>: The follows mean the world to me. I love it. It makes me think you'll come back. I hope you come back. I love when people come back. I will say this. I've been streaming for eight months, whatever with a three month break.

17:53:29
<transcript>: This is one of the rare times I've streamed at these hours. So if you're following me and you're thinking, I'll catch this guy another time at this time I don't often stream at this time. This is a rare thing I normally stream like four or 5 hours earlier, really early in the morning in the us.

17:53:29
<transcript>: just

17:53:39
<transcript>: Just wanted to try streaming in the afternoon because I never do. And I thought I'd meet some new friends, and I did. Turns out met some new friends. Wait, what's your team.

17:53:42
<transcript>: My NBA team.

17:53:42
<transcript>: i

17:53:48
kubahasek: well, for me in Europe it's better at this time, icl

17:53:51
<transcript>: I don't really have an NBA team. I live in the midwest, in the US, and there's no teams around me. The closest team is like the Memphis Griblies, grizzlies or the ogle on the City Thunder.

17:53:51
<transcript>: so

17:53:58
coolpantstv: find some more targets for scamming you mean

17:54:08
<transcript>: So I've just not really ever had an NBA team. I was a fan of players when we first started statues kind of got burned out on sports. After a while, I'm pretty big in the Chiefs. Nfl, just Patrick mahomes pretty into that. It's really close to us. Like we're a few hours from Kansas City. We go to Kansas City a lot.

17:54:08

aj_stuyvenberg: https://twitter.com/thdxr/status/1641514585273294877

17:54:16
<transcript>: So that is probably the closest thing to a team I have would be the Kansas City Chiefs, and that's the NFL. I'm not really following the NBA that closely anymore.

17:54:16
<transcript>: okay

17:54:17
<transcript>: Okay.

17:54:17
<transcript>: should we read

17:54:20
<transcript>: Should we read some Twitter? Do we want to read some Twitter stuff.

17:54:32
<transcript>: For me in Europe. It's better at this time. Oh, well, there you go. I'll see you again, kuba. I hope find some more targets for scamming. You mean? Oh, my goodness, cool pants. His zack's gotten to you.

17:54:37
<transcript>: Okay, let's do it. Twitter Time. Let's do it.

17:54:42
<transcript>: So I actually did some things. I did some things that.

17:54:45
<transcript>: Were probably overkill.

17:54:51
<transcript>: And I don't want you all to test it, so maybe I shouldn't talk about it. Maybe I just won't talk about it.

17:54:54
aj_stuyvenberg: yessssss

17:54:58
<transcript>: So. New video. Dax. I already saw this video. Dex. Did. You surely didn't pay this. You wouldn't do this. Maybe you did.

17:55:09
aj_stuyvenberg: got em

17:55:21
<transcript>: In how you don't need to use it anymore because sst is amazing. Sst. You just like bind stuff and secrets just get passed in as config. You never have to think about it. You don't have to have local infiles. I love the beginning of this video. Dax, when you say the things about there's something on your computer that no one should see that you'd be embarrassed by that's good.

17:55:27
aj_stuyvenberg: @thdxr is linking in the reply the secret sauce?

17:55:33
<transcript>: Good hook. What else we got here? Official language. Tier list? Yeah. Let's look at the tier list. I kind of glanced over it. I was there in the stream for a bit, but I didn't. Really. Yeah, I know you didn't base it.

17:55:37

17:57:49
<transcript>: Being bass is the most.

17:58:01

<transcript>: Slower to load one client. So we're back to aj's Tweet here. It's slower to load one client from the aws sdk version three than it is to load basically the entire version to sdk. So this is something I've heard.

17:59:55
<transcript>: Stocks and a sherman. Thank you for the follows. I've heard this dax, I think has told me this that sdk version Three should be more performant. You should be able to get some benefits from.

17:59:59
<transcript>: More granular packaging of the SDK.

17:59:59
<transcript>: but

18:00:03
thdxr: the environment included v3 thing is soooooooooo baaaaaaaaaad

18:00:03
aj_stuyvenberg: Yes, @thdxr is right

18:00:06

18:05:23
<transcript>: remaining keep mem

18:05:30
<transcript>: Remaining. Keep meming. I started to say, rebase, don't rebase. Don't squash commits. Always include a merge commit.

18:05:32
<transcript>: Get rebase.

18:05:32
<transcript>: interactive

18:05:35
thdxr: oh great I got a classic "good one dax <no laugh>"

18:05:41
<transcript>: Interactive Head seven, get pull, rebates or domain. I'm not smart enough to know smart enough to know what that is. But I think this is funny. I already liked it. So you see how I liked it? And I didn't even understand it.

18:05:46
<transcript>: Sorry to somebody. Lesa. I'm sorry I said I wasn't smart enough.

18:05:54
kiwifromearth: i use steam and discord, no twitter, my sincerest apologies, indubitably

18:05:54
vapor__dev: wow who posted that

18:05:59
<transcript>: I'm not quick enough to parse what this would do. So an interactive rebase. I get that you want to start at head minus seven. Is that what that means? And then git pull rebates origin main.

18:06:05
<transcript>: Can someone tell me someone give me the joke.

18:06:05
<transcript>: someone

18:06:08
<transcript>: Someone posted it. Alan. It wasn't you, I guess.

18:06:08
<transcript>: i saw this one

18:06:12
<transcript>: I saw this one earlier. Okay, so that's all the Tweets we've gotten through. All the tweets.

18:06:19
<transcript>: Okay. Somebody just give me the gist on this one and we'll be good. Honestly. True. Let's see.

18:06:22
thdxr: the dumb thing with this meme is it makes no sense

18:06:26
thdxr: you nver need to do that command

18:06:28
thdxr: so alan is WRONG

18:06:28
<transcript>: Just making sure I'm caught up on Chat. You started with trying to build a bridge.

18:06:33
vapor__dev: dax is wrong

18:06:39
<transcript>: By using Ergo track ball mys makes a mouse pad unnecessary.

18:06:39
<transcript>: though

18:06:42
vapor__dev: he fucked the git up everytime i workeed with him no offsense dax

18:06:44
thdxr: git pull --rebase does that without having to think about the number of commits

18:06:46
vapor__dev: <3

18:06:48
<transcript>: Though. You can't really play games on it. What's an Ergo track ball. Are you getting crisscrossed? That was a good one, nate. That was a good one.

18:06:52
<transcript>: It didn't work. So now I just flame them to make myself feel better.

18:06:52
<transcript>: okay

18:06:59
<transcript>: Okay. I saw dax try to build a bridge than a weirdo eight of esque. I threw disrespect on us in the serverless lounge, no less. I remember that.

18:06:59
<transcript>: read my repl

18:07:02
thdxr: do you really want to get into a technical beef with me?

18:07:08
<transcript>: Read my reply to that. I lol did that tweet oh, you replied to this one. I demand this template. You replied to this one Max or you're talking about the one back there.

18:07:22
<transcript>: Yes. All right. I didn't know you were putting them into your browser as you notice them. Oh, no worries. Yeah, just send Tweets away and it'll load into my browser while we're doing Twitter time here, I got a classic, good one, good one, dax. No laugh.

18:07:36
<transcript>: Sorry I do that. I use Steam in discord. No. Twitter. My sincere apologies. Indubitably. I need to follow you somewhere. Discord. Kiwi, can I follow you on discord? Is there anywhere where you post.

18:07:57
<transcript>: Git pool rebase does that without having to think about the number of commits.

18:07:59
vapor__dev: dax might be right tho

18:08:01
thdxr: not my fault you're wrong

18:08:13
<transcript>: Do you really want to get into a technical beef with me? Uhoh, dax is about to throw some weight around the dumb thing. Alan is wrong. You're the one picking the beast. You guys calm down. Don't bring up beef. We don't need to talk about beef anymore today, all right, that's enough.
