<transcript>: I have one of black shirt every single time I've streamed I think.

00:12:30
<transcript>: Today I'm worn white shirt. Because why not.

00:12:30
<transcript>: why not

00:12:34
<transcript>: Why not mix things up? Things are getting a little crusty, you know, getting a little stale.

00:12:34

<transcript>: so you were

00:12:53
<transcript>: So you were second. But that's pretty funny.

00:12:56
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:12:56
<transcript>: man

00:13:04
<transcript>: Man. Brave. Is that just a video background cut in editing software. The transitions look really nice. What kind of camera was used? Yeah. We talked about extensive camera.

00:13:07
<transcript>: Intro is prerecorded.

00:13:09
<transcript>: Also true.

00:13:12
joostschuur: Howdy

00:13:12
<transcript>: That no one knows.

00:13:12
<transcript>: adams behind

00:13:19
<transcript>: Adams behind the camera. Every stream shooting all of this. Not prerecorded. That would be some dedication. Crying, cryo if I were actually filming.

00:13:19
<transcript>: an

00:13:27
<transcript>: An exact like hand recording of that intro every single time. Wouldn't that be amazing.

00:13:27
<transcript>: that would be

00:13:28
<transcript>: That would be.

00:13:28
<transcript>: something

00:13:29
<transcript>: Something.

00:13:34
<transcript>: Taylor's here.

00:13:34
<transcript>: ober

00:13:38

<transcript>: gifted

00:13:52
swatee_: morning!

<transcript>: Gifted a Tier One song to dax. Look at that.

00:13:54
tiredbeaver: hi

00:13:55
<transcript>: Dax is a subscriber. Now.

00:14:01
<transcript>: I want both. Number One badges.

00:14:07
<transcript>: Oh, like if you give an up sub you'll have the number one Gifts badge. Is there a badge for that.

00:14:18
<transcript>: I was looking at an A Seven C was an 800 hours lens that looked really good. Also need to do some research on money for value there. So the A Seven C series is more for stills.

00:14:24
<transcript>: The A seven? S series more for video, so just depends on what you're doing with the camera.

00:14:24
<transcript>: i

00:14:27
<transcript>: I know way too much back cameras for somebody who's not a photographer.

00:14:27
<transcript>: i guess

00:14:30
<transcript>: I guess I'm kind of becoming if it's already.

00:14:30
<transcript>: becoming a video

00:14:39
<transcript>: Becoming a videographer with all the streaming I do. Can I can I put that on my resume now. I've never had a resume. If I had a resume, could I put it on there? Videographer.

00:14:39
<transcript>: amateur

00:14:42
<transcript>: Amateur videographer sounds so cool.

00:14:46
darrenbaldwin03: whats a good starter cam for streaming?

00:14:47
<transcript>: Welcome to the sub Club, dax, the secret club that we don't speak of.

00:14:52
<transcript>: Hey, dax, you have access to the subway channel. Now, in the discord. Watch. Dev. Everybody, check it out.

00:14:57
vimcerf: I'm sure there's a videographer cert you could get

00:14:59
<transcript>: I just wrote a message in there yesterday. How's that? I'm getting good at this. This clip, mating thing.

00:15:01
<transcript>: Is that clickbait.

00:15:09
tiredbeaver: no

00:15:14
tiredbeaver: not click bait

00:15:15
<transcript>: Gotta have the lara Bar there in sierra. I do have a lar bar sitting on my desk because yesterday I have this, like, overhead camera that pans across my desk. And someone, like, pointed out that there wasn't a lar bar setting there. Apparently, that's an expectation. Now.

00:15:15
<transcript>: so

00:15:19
<transcript>: So there you go. I hate being subtom. I don't want to support you.

00:15:21
<transcript>: That's funny.

00:15:21
<transcript>: dax i

00:15:23
manbravegg: hmm maybe I should go with the one you have then. Mainly want to do video. Also want to do photography too, but not exclusively.

00:15:24
<transcript>: Dax I listen to our first podcast episode Last night.

00:15:37
<transcript>: Seriously. I did, like when we were on when I had you on aws FM. I listened to it. I thought there might be some, like, good Nuggets in there. Now it was really boring, actually. It's like an hour long.

00:15:38
kryotoboi: I missed the Larabar yesterday,  there was big bowl of cereal instead

00:15:42
<transcript>: I mean, it wasn't boring to listen. You tell you. So I've just heard your story from us. Now that like.

00:15:42
<transcript>: boring

00:15:44
<transcript>: Boring.

00:15:52
<transcript>: Getting free ssd marketing exactly. Now I pay for it by having to be adam's friend. Ouch, ouch. Take my all the good things I said about you just now.

00:15:54
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:15:54
<transcript>: now supporting

00:16:00
<transcript>: Now supporting twitch. That's something we actually don't want to support. Yeah, the twitch situation.

00:16:00
<transcript>: sucks

00:16:01
<transcript>: Sucks.

00:16:01
<transcript>: hope i'm

00:16:03
<transcript>: Hope I'm still here.

00:16:03
<transcript>: this time

00:16:18
<transcript>: This time next week, we'll see it's Twitch dying like Twitter died. Twitter kind of is dying. Every time I open Twitter, there's something new wrong with it. I swear. Like when you tweet now, when I tweet, it just gives a big error message. It sends the tweet.

00:16:18
<transcript>: but

00:16:28
<transcript>: But like the page I land on is like something went wrong. But don't worry. It's not your fault. I wasn't worried. That was my fault. I've tweeted for the last twelve years, like I was worried it was your fault. Always.

00:16:28
<transcript>: i'm never concerned

00:16:31
<transcript>: I'm never concerned that I didn't know how to tweet.

00:16:35
<transcript>: Are we talking Adam in games.

00:16:35
<transcript>: unfortunately

00:16:36
<transcript>: Unfortunately no.

00:16:36
<transcript>: i mean you

00:16:39
fragaverage: On a serious note RE the twitch drama: FossaBot could be in trouble

00:16:41
<transcript>: I mean, you'd have stopped my wife into games, and they'd have to be games that I cannot get addicted to.

00:16:44

manbravegg: Because coffee, that is why it would be brown. :P

00:17:05
<transcript>: No shirt plus.

00:17:15
kryotoboi: It would be concerning if that error read, "Something went wrong, its your fault "

00:17:16
<transcript>: I'm not gonna get started on that one. Just is here and couch is here and swatty is here and tired Beaver is here. Tired Beaver.

00:17:16
<transcript>: i feel like

00:17:18
<transcript>: I feel like I know you a lot better now.

00:17:18
<transcript>: from

00:17:20
<transcript>: From getting.

00:17:20
<transcript>: i've

00:17:23
<transcript>: I've kind of entered into tawny's orbit a little bit.

00:17:35
<transcript>: And I know things about you. Okay? Tired. I know things that I didn't know before. I'm trying to remember one. That's why I'm selling right now. There was something I learned about you. And I wanted. Next time I saw you.

00:17:37
vimcerf: @Kryotoboi that's what tesla's car say when you crash them, so that's accurate

00:17:42
<transcript>: I wanted to call out this thing, and I can't remember what it is. Oh.

00:17:47
<transcript>: Yeah, we both like taro Bubblepiece. There you go. Bowba, tease, whatever.

00:17:47

<transcript>: so there you

00:17:56
tiredbeaver: oh i thought i did something bad

00:17:56
<transcript>: So there you go.

00:17:56
<transcript>: darren

00:17:59
tiredbeaver: OMEGALUL

00:18:01
<transcript>: Darren, What's a good starter Cam for streaming. I'm not good with starter stuff.

00:18:01
<transcript>: i am not

00:18:09
tiredbeaver: taro tea is goated

00:18:13
overra_dev: I only had taro when I tried mochi for the first time and it was a weird first experience

00:18:21
<transcript>: I am not good. I'm more for the advanced craft, the crowd that wants to spend a whole lot of money. I can help those people. I'm not good for the starter. Maybe like a Sony A Something, Ace 6600 or something. I don't know. I'm really not good at that. Someone probably knows there's someone out here that probably knows what a good starter Cam would be. I'm sure.

00:18:21
<transcript>: there's a video

00:18:24
<transcript>: There's a videographer Cert you could get.

00:18:24
<transcript>: i

00:18:26
<transcript>: I am good at getting.

00:18:26
<transcript>: started

00:18:38
thdxr: you can't say Sony and starter in the same sentence

00:18:39
<transcript>: Started. Maybe I should go with the one you have mainly want to do video. Also wanted to do photography two. But now exclusively you should go with this. Sony a seven, four. It's a great hybrid. Good for stills, good for.

00:18:41
<transcript>: Video.

00:18:41
<transcript>: really

00:18:46
<transcript>: Really similar picture quality. I use it. I've got a couple of them here in the office. You'll see them on the stream.

00:18:50
andom: Howdy HeyGuys

00:18:53
thdxr: mochi is so friggin good

00:18:55
<transcript>: They're great. They just they'll overheat it 4k. So if you're shooting long 4k sessions like over an hour, hour and a half, they will overheat.

00:18:55
<transcript>: it's a larger

00:18:59
typosrry: simpol, plug your 100$ logi webcam, and start the stream LUL

00:19:02
<transcript>: It's a larger sensor. It down samples to 4k. You'll run into that. But if you only stream at 1080p like I do.

00:19:10
darrenbaldwin03: Do you need a dedicated stream computer if ur just doing coding shit? I have a maxed out m2 max but dont know if I should get a PC

00:19:22
<transcript>: It's fine. And if you're shooting long YouTube videos, A seven S three is gonna save you there. So that's the difference. If you're shooting long sessions of 4k, go with the A seven S three. It'll never overheat. If you're not, you can basically the same picture quality for thousand dollars less for the A seven four and takes good stills. It's a better still photography camera. Okay. As an FBI cameras.

00:19:32
<transcript>: I missed the Larry Bar yesterday. There was a big bowl of cereal. Instead, there's a bol of cereal on my desk right now. You'll see it here in a minute. It's a small bullet shield today.

00:19:38
<transcript>: On a series note, read the Twitter twitch drama Faucebot could be in trouble oh, jeez, please don't know.

00:19:41
<transcript>: Is aidin okay? Is he still employed.

00:19:41
<transcript>: i've

00:19:46
<transcript>: I've seen I've seen the hints I hope that all goes well.

00:19:46
<transcript>: i

00:19:56
<transcript>: I will pay all money for fastbutt every month. I depend on it. The VINDAS here. What's going on? Da vinda? Because coffee. That's why I would. How I see. That's why I'd be Brown. I'm not gonna spill my coffee.

00:20:08
<transcript>: Yeah. It would be concerning if it said something went wrong. It's your fault. I agree. That's what tesla's car say when you crash them. So that's accurate. It's your phone. Yeah.

00:20:08
<transcript>: no

00:20:08
ihavedepressed: What's your fav game?

00:20:10
overra_dev: camo app + phone camera is not a bad starter

00:20:16
<transcript>: No joke in our new Tesla. We just got a new one. We've traded our 2016 X in and got a 2023.

00:20:18
<transcript>: And as a camera.

00:20:18
<transcript>: clearly

00:20:25
<transcript>: Clearly on like up here, like when you're saying the driver's say it's like up here on the little above the mirror.

00:20:25
<transcript>: that's point

00:20:26
<transcript>: That's pointed at you.

00:20:26
<transcript>: and

00:20:29
ihavedepressed: Mine is Gwak gwak 3000

00:20:31
<transcript>: And I asked my wife, like, Is that why would they have a camera pointing in the cabin.

00:20:31
<transcript>: and

00:20:33
devinda_me: adam is so relatable man, a new tesla :o

00:20:37
<transcript>: And she's right. It's probably so they can, like, blame you in a crash. Like you weren't paying attention.

00:20:37
<transcript>: that

00:20:38
<transcript>: That's so.

00:20:38
<transcript>: i'm just

00:20:42
tayloreddev: you will be fine streaming on a m2 max and doing other things too

00:20:45
<transcript>: I'm just positive that's what it is to it some kind of legal liability thing. Like they can point to footage from looking at you.

00:20:47
<transcript>: Anyway.

00:20:47
<transcript>: tarot

00:20:55
<transcript>: Tarot is goaded. It's true. It's delicious. You didn't do something bad. Tired. I just got to know you better been hanging out and tawny's discord.

00:20:55
<transcript>: hanging out

00:20:58
<transcript>: Hanging out and Tani's vods I don't know.

00:21:00
overra_dev: can you cover the camera?

00:21:05
tiredbeaver: lol

00:21:07
<transcript>: Only had taro when I tried Mochi for the first time. And it was a weird first experience. I've never had mochi. Wait, what's? Mochi.

00:21:07
<transcript>: can't

00:21:10
<transcript>: Can't say Sony and Starter in the same sentence.

00:21:10
<transcript>: and

00:21:12
<transcript>: And I'm see you.

00:26:52
<transcript>: should

00:26:57
fragaverage: WOWWWWW

00:26:58
<transcript>: Should we not have a message in chat every time someone does a win, do you like to have the confirmation that you didn't win.

00:27:00
laytanl_: Just spent 20k rip

00:27:00
<transcript>: Does it feel better? Knowing.

00:27:00
<transcript>: you're certain you

00:27:02
fryday444: Probably just if somone wins

00:27:05
<transcript>: You're certain you didn't win? Or would you rather just only tell you if you win.

00:27:08
<transcript>: Can you filter the redeem.

00:27:08
<transcript>: like

00:27:10
<transcript>: Like from my overlays.

00:27:22
<transcript>: i was gonna

00:27:24
m1lk5hak3r: We should make it beep louder

00:27:26
typosrry: Yeah, we need confirmation, cuz we would ask all the time if this working or not

00:27:32
thdxr: 1% LOL

00:27:34
<transcript>: I was gonna do 1% but then when I did the math, and it was like, how many, how many points can someone earn? And the amount of stream that I do each week is Rick Roll still there? It shouldn't still be there. It doesn't work anymore.

00:27:34

00:27:47
<transcript>: You guys are funny.

00:27:51
fragaverage: I DID!

00:27:56
<transcript>: I'm still making sure no one has won. It'll be very obvious when someone wins. It'll also be a message from me. Fred gets one too.

00:27:57
fragaverage: Guys, I told you Adam's a scammer!

00:28:00
<transcript>: You guys are funny.

00:28:04
<transcript>: So the chance a percentage chance is zero. 1%.

vimcerf: Sadge

00:29:10
<transcript>: It's getting a little hard to focus.

00:29:14
<transcript>: The uncertainty.

00:29:19

00:29:26
dnbull: can i get my 5k refund on rick roll?

00:29:29
dnbull: oh nvm

00:29:30
<transcript>: Did not win. I demand a refund. I'm so sorry, dimbo. Can I give you that five K back? How can I just, like, assign points to somebody? Is it possible.

dnbull: u read it

00:29:32
fragaverage: Cant

00:29:36
dnbull: yeah it is on the dashboard

00:29:44
<transcript>: Anybody. Now, can I just give someone 5000 points? Because Dnbull. I. O. D. And bowl 5000 points. Here's what I'll do. The impulse, do you want to just spend it on five entries? Because I could redeem five entries. And if I win.

00:29:44
<transcript>: it's your is your macbook

00:29:44
fragaverage: Its auto fulfilled in your code

00:29:46
<transcript>: It's your is your macbook. How about that.

00:29:48
thdxr: ADAM IS A SCAMMER

00:29:51
oetziofficial: @adamdotdev you can decline it in the redeems window and return it back

00:29:56
fragaverage: @thdxr I SECOND THIS MOTION

00:30:01
<transcript>: I did. No, you didn't. Did somebody win to seriously. You will know it will be a message for me and it'll be very obvious that somebody won. I do not see one. I did not expect this many redeems, so I'm having to scroll a lot.

00:30:03
dnbull: you can refund on the dashboard for points

00:30:06
<transcript>: So welcome to Chat milkshaker.

00:30:11
oetziofficial: ^

00:30:15
<transcript>: That would have wrecked you 1% yeah, that would have been toast. That would have been broke.

00:30:17
fragaverage: @dnbull Redemptions are auto completed because adam code LUL

00:30:24
vimcerf: chatRiot

00:30:25
dnbull: @FragAverage oh lol

00:30:27
m1lk5hak3r: HeyGuys

00:30:35
<transcript>: Told you, I'm just a scanner. You guys are all trying to make up these stories about me like I'm a scammer, and I'm cringey and I'm we need 1000 redeems. Go, I guess. Yeah. If you had a hundred thousand points and you redeemed it a thousand times. No, that'd be a million points. And you redeemed a thousand times. The odds are maybe in your favor. I don't know.

00:30:35
<transcript>: i don't know how math

00:30:37
<transcript>: I don't know how math works.

00:30:41
<transcript>: Dean Blue did what a macbook pro.

00:30:41
<transcript>: i don't even know if

00:30:45
<transcript>: I don't even know if I need a Mac Pro. It's not a Mac pro? It's a macbook pro.

00:30:45
<transcript>: yeah

00:30:47
mavered24: what's the algorithm behind the redeem

00:30:50
fragaverage: Can you write a script to show us it working? With "FragAverage" as the test user. Cool

00:30:56
<transcript>: Yeah, Matt. Thought range is less than zero. Zero one. Basically. That's what I did. Yeah. Did not win. Did not win. Rigged. Did not win. 1%. Seems high. Oh.

00:30:57
tiredbeaver: oh my god

00:31:06
<transcript>: Is that too high? Am I gonna give away too many macbooks? I have 17k so I won't spam it. Well, let's see. You can spam it some while I turned it off for now, but you can give it to me.

00:31:06
<transcript>: could easily

00:31:09
thdxr: 0.1% seems high too

00:31:09
typosrry: You would need to enter the giveaway at least 4595 times to have a 99% chance of winning the MacBook Pro.  n >= log(0.01) / log(0.999) ≈ 4594.63

00:31:16
<transcript>: Could easily burn through that in a few days, weeks. Oh, boy, I can't give him away at two frequent clips or I will. I will be broke. Dane. Alex, thank you so much for that. Follow.

00:31:16
<transcript>: can you get

00:31:17
<transcript>: Can you get.

00:31:31
<transcript>: Yeah, never mind. You read it. Yeah, it's on the dashboard. Oh, auto fulfilled. Yeah, I auto fulfill everything. Sorry, Adam is not a scammer. Stop it that you can decline it in the redeems window and return it back. Oh, I can.

00:31:31
<transcript>: even if

00:31:35
<transcript>: Even if I auto fulfilled it, I think I ought to fulfill it.

00:31:38
dnbull: so you mean theres a chance? Kappa "dumb and dumber movie quote"

00:31:39
<transcript>: I think I auto fulfill it.

00:31:39
<transcript>: you can refund

00:31:41
<transcript>: You can refund on the dashboard for points.

00:31:41
<transcript>: or autocom

00:31:45
oetziofficial: ohhhhh then you cant

00:31:45
<transcript>: Or autocomplete. Because Adam. Code. Yeah, sorry.

00:31:45
<transcript>: sorry

00:31:52
<transcript>: Sorry. What's the algorithm behind the redeem? It's a zero 1% chance that you will win a MacBook.

00:31:52
<transcript>: can you

00:31:57
<transcript>: Can you write a script to show us it working with frag average as the test user. Cool.

00:32:00
thdxr: there will be 1 winner every 1000 attempts

00:32:09
<transcript>: So zero 1% is too high. Good to know we're gonna make a little change to that eight 1% is too high. I don't want to give away. There'll be a winner. What? Every thousand attempts too often. That's probably too often.

00:32:09
<transcript>: you would

00:32:11
thdxr: that's 1M points

00:32:20

00:33:29
mavered24: 69ception

00:33:35
<transcript>: And her Tweet had 69 views. So I've completed. Well, I guess we could keep this going. If you guys could just wait until this Tweet has 69 views, and then somebody could tweet it. We could just keep this going forever. 69. Seven. Exactly.

00:33:46
oetziofficial: 69 retweets, do it chat

<transcript>: Let's see. Aj, you knew this was coming. You knew I was gonna talk about this, tweet. I can't make a tweet this good and not talk about it like this is just I don't make a lot of good tweets this one. This one was good for me because it was a high effort, tweet. I really had to work for it to get her view count up to 69. And there's, like a huge delay.

00:33:55

00:34:22
<transcript>: Okay. I think it is how math works. 69 retweets do it, chat. Oh, there you go. Somebody retweet this thing 69 times.

00:34:22
<transcript>: and then there we go

00:34:23
<transcript>: And then there we go.

00:34:33
<transcript>: 1% is probably good. Okay, we'll fix that. We'll fix the giveaway and make it a little less, little less intense. Somebody sent me some tweets.

<transcript>: Check with zero. Zero. 1% if Adam will use that next. Yeah. So point. Oh, 1%. How often will I give them away? I could probably get away a macbook every month.

00:44:29
<transcript>: i wouldn't

00:44:34
<transcript>: I wouldn't want to do it every week. That would be. That would be too many another Tweet. Good. Reddit copy link.

00:45:29
<transcript>: oof

00:45:32
joostschuur: @joostschuur Hmm, it also says 1 week at 0.01%. OK, maybe it parsed the prompt wrong

00:45:33
<transcript>: Oof, if you have 50 viewers, they can win it with nine days of watching you.

00:45:35
<transcript>: Yeah, it's not ideal.

00:45:39
<transcript>: Kemplay, I just rolled out here with zero 1%. What if I had done 1%.

00:45:45
<transcript>: After all these rich treats, he's gonna go broke. Wouldn't that be funny.

00:45:55

<transcript>: Someone I need to do the math so if I want to give away one a month.

00:46:06
<transcript>: ish

00:46:10
<transcript>: Ish and if people only send their points on this which apparently that's all they'll spend their points on.

00:46:17
joostschuur: Wait, I read it wrong. It went from 1 week to 192 years?

00:46:18
<transcript>: What's the map? What's the math say? Giving away too many macbooks? I never understood spanking. But maybe it slaps.

00:46:18
<transcript>: made it slap

00:46:20
<transcript>: Made it slap.

<transcript>: Whoa.

00:46:30
joostschuur: OK, AI is stupid and I need lunch

<transcript>: I could give away a MacBook every hundred night. Two years. That's way easier.

00:46:30
<transcript>: zero one

00:46:33
<transcript>: Zero 1% is 90 days.

00:46:36

00:46:41
vimcerf: POGGERS Adam fixed the orientation of the LÄRABAR

00:47:02
<transcript>: Now you guys are gonna know the message.

00:47:11
<transcript>: Winner. I also put it in the console logs. I would know. So we're not gonna do point one. We're gonna do zero one. Do we think that's that's good.

00:47:13
<transcript>: That a tiny enough chance.

00:47:13
<transcript>: but i won't go

00:47:15

<transcript>: Make it a little more exclusive.

00:47:29
thdxr: yeah

00:47:33
ayushsharma: Will you giveaway with that rigged giveaway system?

00:47:36
<transcript>: You say .01% well, this is actually a multiplying by a hundred because my brain, my small brain just doesn't work with tiny little fractions like that.

00:47:36
a_maher938: that's forever ll

00:47:41
overra_dev: yeah

00:47:41
<transcript>: Will you give away with that rigged giveaway system.

00:47:42
thdxr: the .01% should be fine

12:54:07
<transcript>: Wow. That would be taken it that would that sounds like how I would normally do things like, way over done. Oh, boy. Here they come.

12:54:07
<transcript>: you people with your

12:54:09
<transcript>: You people with your redeeming.

12:54:09
<transcript>: how did

12:54:14
<transcript>: How did you even know it was back up? I didn't even know it was back up yet.

12:54:26
<transcript>: This is all of my stream is gonna be I thought we could just have a nice thing. People thought we could have a nice thing, but not like go crazy, you know, I'm gonna make it worth I'm gonna make it cost, like 30 points, maybe.

12:54:26
<transcript>: like

12:54:28
ayushsharma: Is it real?

12:54:29
<transcript>: Like as much as a MacBook.

12:54:30
a_maher938: just make the notifications

12:54:34
<transcript>: Is it real.

12:54:34
<transcript>: it is real

12:54:36
a_maher938: disapear

12:54:36
oetziofficial: @adamdotdev twitch notifies new redeems I believe

12:54:37
<transcript>: It is real. Like if somebody wins it, then they win it.

12:54:42
<transcript>: Oh, twitch, notifies new redeems. Interesting.

12:54:51
<transcript>: Okay, so maybe maybe we'll make it cost more so that it's not spammed my entire stream. Like we're not just, like, constantly listening to the beep, the beat, beep, beep.

12:54:51
<transcript>: i guess

12:54:55
<transcript>: I guess everyone's just kind of dumping their points right now. Maybe it'll get better.

12:54:55
<transcript>: but i

12:55:00
<transcript>: But I am thinking I'm gonna make it like, 3000. How do we feel? About 3000.

12:55:02
<transcript>: How do we feel about that.

12:55:06
joostschuur: Beep could have a max/hour too

12:55:06
wesleycoder: It'll get better

12:55:07
<transcript>: I should probably make a play different sound too, but like if it's a winner.

12:55:09
a_maher938: i didn't even complete 1k point yet

12:55:10
<transcript>: It'll get better.

12:55:12
pot0fgreeed: you can cap it

12:55:14
<transcript>: Deep. Could have a Max per hour or two. Yeah.

12:55:15
daglee: Make it so you buy 10 tickets?

12:55:16
wesleycoder: 3k will break everyone banks

12:55:17
<transcript>: So mat here hasn't even.

12:55:17
<transcript>: completed

12:55:19
typosrry: with 0.1% chance it would take around 6 months to win a single MBP, with 0.01% it would take 5 years.

12:55:22
fryday444: Maybe no sound, just overlay?

12:55:23
oetziofficial: oh there is the winning message KEKW

12:55:24
<transcript>: Completed 1000 points yet. Yeah, I realized 1000 kind of a lot, but I've not had anything for you guys to do with your point. So you're just spamming this.

12:55:24
<transcript>: i

12:55:27
<transcript>: I can cap it. I could say, you can only do like.

12:55:27
<transcript>: two

12:55:29
<transcript>: Two. A stream.

12:55:29
<transcript>: let's do that

12:55:32
<transcript>: Let's do that everyone can only do like to a stream.

12:55:38
<transcript>: Make sure you buy ten tickets. 30 will break everyone's banks. Yeah, we'll keep it at a thousand.

12:55:39
a_maher938: ppl will run out of points

12:55:41
<transcript>: Let's do.

12:55:45
wesleycoder: we've been saving for this moment

12:55:48
<transcript>: Yeah, it's hard to go in and change the way there is a winning message? What.

12:55:48
<transcript>: no

12:55:50
<transcript>: No, it isn't.

12:55:50
<transcript>: nobody won

12:55:50
thdxr: then 0.01% is too small

12:55:52
<transcript>: Nobody won, right.

12:55:52
<transcript>: it's hard to

12:55:52
joostschuur: Fun fact, in college my nickname was Feature Creep

12:55:53
<transcript>: It's hard to stay on top of all this.

12:56:02
<transcript>: It's hard for me to go in and start making special rules for the overlay. I just are for, like the redeem. I'm just gonna I'm gonna limit it. You can only do.

12:56:02
<transcript>: two every

12:56:04
<transcript>: Two every day. How about that.

12:56:07
<transcript>: How about that.

12:56:12
wesleycoder: 2 per day is fine

12:56:13
<transcript>: College. My nickname was Feature creep. That's funny.

12:56:13
<transcript>: okay

12:56:52

12:57:11
<transcript>: Oh, like I'm showing you guys. Yeah, I realize I'm showing you guys the winning message. I'm fine with that. It has to come from me. If it doesn't come from me, it's not the real message so people can fake it. But it's not real if it doesn't come from me. You know, I'm saying.

Well, you know what? You can just keep sticking around. You'll keep getting more chances. I'm so excited about this, actually.

12:57:38
ocelot2123: wait is he actually giving out a macbook pro or is this a meme LUL

12:57:43
<transcript>: Juice. You're stepping down from your positions, officials. That's funny. I'm okay with the level of risk that we've got right now. Zero, zero 1% seems fair. And now people can only do it twice a stream. So maybe when I start my stream, every little spam, it get out of the way. And then we move on with life. You know what I mean.

12:57:43
<transcript>: wait

12:57:51
thdxr: well .01% is too low now

12:57:55
overra_dev: dank memes

12:57:59
<transcript>: Wait. Is he actually giving out a macbook pro? Or is this a meme? It's not a meme. I'm giving it away. If somebody wins it, I'm giving it away. I just gave one to somebody randomly on Twitter, and it turned out they really needed a macbook, and it was a really cool situation where I let randomness.

12:57:59
<transcript>: decide

12:58:02
joostschuur: @ocelot2123 Adam’s father in law owns Canada

12:58:08
<transcript>: Dink memes.

12:58:08
<transcript>: zero percent

12:58:11
<transcript>: 0% is too low now.

12:58:11

<transcript>: Are you being serious.

12:58:19
a_maher938: what if it goes to someone out of the us

12:58:23
<transcript>: I guess the cap would mean not as many points being spent.

12:58:24
oetziofficial: good used my points well, I am done for today :)

12:58:26
typosrry: .0.1% is giving out 1 MBP in every 5 years LUL

12:58:30

12:58:30
<transcript>: fun fact

12:58:30
devinda_me: belive in randomness adam, it works !!

12:58:35

12:58:35
<transcript>: and

12:58:35
thdxr: eh I guess it's fine

12:58:40

12:58:42
<transcript>: So.

12:58:42

12:58:44
<transcript>: I will ship it to you wherever you are.

12:58:44
<transcript>: just wherever you

daglee: What if I'm on the moon?!

12:59:05
<transcript>: There's, Captain Two. It's a very tiny chance. It'll just make a thumbs more fun. When someone does win, I'm gonna freak out like, you guys are gonna watch me freak out, freak out on stream? It's gonna be so cool because it's such a tiny percent chance, right? If it were just like, easy, then it's not fun.

12:59:08
daglee: Will you ship it?

12:59:12
<transcript>: Okay. What if I'm on the moon? Yeah, I can't ship to the moon. We're gonna have to stick to the plane.

12:59:33
smedwardd: would it be cheaper to ship from apple to winner?

12:59:40
<transcript>: Did we. Did we have fun? I don't know. I had fun. I hope you had fun. Let's give it a back over here. We got to connect our postgres database. There's some actually like hard work in front of us right now.

12:59:49
<transcript>: Would it be cheaper to ship from Apple to winner? It would be. And I thought about that. I thought about that after I gave that one away and mailed it to Italy.

12:59:58
<transcript>: with so

13:00:09
wesleycoder: Wait, is actually 7, i thought it was 6

13:00:11
<transcript>: With so many streams of the coming weeks and months. Fabi thank you so much that follow and half Stark welcome to Chat Alien Dance. I guess I don't have a plugin or something that should show that to me.

13:00:11
<transcript>: so we

13:00:13
<transcript>: So we need this page right here.

13:00:14
thdxr: instead of working on statmuse maybe you should watch a movie

13:00:19
<transcript>: We need this URL to render that page. How are we gonna do that? We're gonna connect to postgres.

13:00:23
oetziofficial: @adamdotdev what do you think of the AI push on twitter and are you already "sick" of the ai tools?

13:00:25

13:00:25
<transcript>: vishell

13:00:34
<transcript>: Vishell. Thank you for that follow. I'm sorry I bought your name. Instead of working on Statmes, maybe you should watch a movie. Watch a movie. Dax on stream.

13:00:51
a_maher938: whats a db proxy ?

13:00:54
<transcript>: Oh, let's see, what do you think of the AI push on Twitter? And are you already sick of the AI tools? I'll tell you what my Twitter feed is nonstop. Ai tweets. It is amazing how many people are tweeting about AI. Just like, what's funny to me is the people who were something else. They were like a devil or something. And now they're an Aixpert, like they've decided.

13:01:06
joostschuur: Yeah, my name is pronounced ‘Yoast’ and not ‘Juiced’ BTW :)

13:01:07
<transcript>: It's clearly a very hard pivot for their career where they're like, Now, I'm just gonna ride a newsletter about AI. I'm just. I'm all in. It's, like, shoved all their chips into the middle, like, forget my entire reputation, everything I've ever done. I'm an AI expert. Now, that's what I do.

13:01:13
<transcript>: I think that's interesting. It's fascinating to me. Like, I guess if you're really convicted, this is the future of everything.

13:01:18
thdxr: JUICED

13:01:33
thdxr: Adam I'm getting a sense you don't like devrels

13:01:33
<transcript>: I don't know. I feel like your reputation can only handle that so much. I guess these are the same people that bounced around at like 15 different startups, and they were DeBrill for somebody else every other week. So maybe they don't care. They don't care about their reputation. I don't know. Not that like liking AI is bad for your reputation. Just like it's weird to me that like it feels so much like the crypto thing. Ai is amazing.

13:01:33

wesleycoder: All "web3 devs" are AI-experts now

13:01:54
<transcript>: The things that people are gonna build with it, these tools and AI such a broad term. But like, the things that we're gonna be able to do so much faster, the productivity boom, that all the stuff will mean. It's fantastic. But it's just funny to me. It's funny to me to see people like, just like, decide that's their new career, like because something cool came along. Like, Now I am.

13:01:54
<transcript>: gonna just

13:01:57
<transcript>: Gonna just go all in. I don't know.

13:02:16
overra_dev: heh I think I know who you're referencing

13:02:19
<transcript>: There's just a few bad apples, and they're not even bad apples. Just like a few people that rubbed me the wrong way. I guess I do like it in some cases, but most of them are a copy of a copy of a copy on questions of it's actually helpful. Yeah. I don't know. There's a lot of noise right now. It's hard to know, like, what is real and what is.

13:02:19
<transcript>: just gonna

13:02:21
thdxr: you know the Prisma team was rude to me once

13:02:25

13:02:36

13:02:40
<transcript>: They now became AI people. And that's what they talk about.

13:02:43
<transcript>: Keep it up and going back to Prisma.

13:02:49
joostschuur: @thdxr They invited me to a feedback call once and I ghosted them. Oops.

13:02:56
<transcript>: Hide very well hah, thank you for the follow also. Gudoc.

13:03:00
<transcript>: And zarka, thank you for the followers, everybody.

13:03:00
<transcript>: i'm afraid

13:03:07
<transcript>: I'm afraid I didn't veil my reference to someone very well, and people know who it is now.

13:03:08
thdxr: yeah I live in Adams basement

13:03:13
<transcript>: You know, the prisoner team was rude to me once and now I'm ending.

13:03:15
oetziofficial: I have no clue who it can be. honestly I dont even care

13:03:16
<transcript>: Vin, Dick.

13:03:18
joostschuur: @thdxr Drizxzle docs are terrible though. OK, I need lunch here though!

13:03:20
thdxr: they kept implying I was making up what I was saying about it not working well in lambda

13:03:23
<transcript>: They invited me to feedback call once and I ghosted them. That's funny.

13:03:25
overra_dev: nah you're good, i could be wrong lol

13:03:26
daglee: AI is even so mainstream, that open source people trying to build AI with open data sets etc.

13:03:27
<transcript>: Are you from the ozarks as well? I am. Oh, wait. No. Yes, dax. Never mind.

13:03:29
<transcript>: Losing my basement.

13:03:33
<transcript>: Okay.

13:03:33
<transcript>: dr terrible

13:03:37
joostschuur: @thdxr I think that was Elon Musk

13:03:44
<transcript>: Dr. Terrible, though. Okay, I need lunch. So prism is terrible. Sorry. I'm just. I'm throwing out a lot of hot takes. It's just like anyone who likes prisma. It's like I immediately know what they have never done. They have never used.

13:03:44
<transcript>: any

13:03:46
oetziofficial: I LOVE PRISMA

13:03:52
<transcript>: Any serverless infrastructure or deployed Prisma into something serverless or they just have no idea how slow they're thing is that could be too.

13:03:56
cchambers75: Its a weird transition from twitter to normal life where a decent number of people I talk to who aren't devs don't care/know much about AI

13:04:11
<transcript>: They kept implying, let's see, I have no clue. Drizzle. Docks or Terrible. Okay, they kept implying I was making up what I was saying about it not working well in lambda. Now it really doesn't. It's giant and fat. And the my first experience with it was like, Wait, seriously, people are excited about this. People enjoy using this.

13:04:12
treasonist: or i don't want to learn SQL <.<

13:04:14
devinda_me: you expect me to learn SQL ?

13:04:14
<transcript>: Hey.

13:04:14
<transcript>: is even

13:04:17
fryday444: How about TypeORM?

13:04:20
<transcript>: Is even so mainstream that open source people trying to build AI with open datasets. Yeah. I saw the llama stuff.

13:04:23
wesleycoder: For those trying prisma w/ serverless try out planetscale, it's great

13:04:28
<transcript>: Oh, my word. My kids are jumping up and down above me like they just they're just jumping. I think they're just literally in their room, right above me, jumping.

13:04:28
<transcript>: why

13:04:31
<transcript>: Why? I don't know. They're kids. That's what they do.

13:04:32
andreaslorozco: g'morning y'all!

13:04:36
smilingbig: happy kids

13:04:45
<transcript>: Oh, it's you love prisma. You love it? Are you just trolling me? You love prisma? It's a weird transition from Twitter to normal life, where a decent number of people I talk to aren't devs. Don't care much about AI. Yeah.

13:04:45
<transcript>: it's

13:04:48
<transcript>: It's one of those Twitter bubble things.

13:04:53
tardidriss: hi

13:04:53
schrew: trampoline park vibes

13:04:56
<transcript>: Feels like we're just like, extremely online bubble. Like, wherever anyone that's extremely online hangs out. That's all they talk about today. I now.

13:04:56
<transcript>: i don't want to learn

13:04:57
<transcript>: I don't want to learn sequel.

13:04:57
<transcript>: i don't want to

13:05:03
<transcript>: I don't want to learn sequel. Either of the prisma, ain't it Prismayne? It.

13:05:03
<transcript>: that's all i'm saying

13:05:04
<transcript>: That's all I'm saying.

13:05:07
<transcript>: Did it Zoom in on me again.

13:05:10
<transcript>: Why is it doing that.

13:05:10
<transcript>: it's not zooming

13:05:11
m1lk5hak3r: I am curious, how is statmuse making money?

13:05:14
oetziofficial: no troll, I work with it daily - 3 production (self-hosted) projects using prisma.

13:05:14
<transcript>: It's not zooming out is the problem. It's only zooming in.

13:05:16
<transcript>: Okay.

13:05:16
<transcript>: for those

13:05:17
thdxr: it zoomed it on "Prisma ain't it"

13:05:19
thdxr: pretty good

13:05:22
overra_dev: lol

13:05:25
<transcript>: For those trying prisma serverless tryout Planet Scale plant scale is so good, but I guess you still need to figure out how you're going to interact with Planet skill.

13:05:25
<transcript>: how

13:05:28
<transcript>: How about typ? I've never used it.

13:05:28
<transcript>: i

13:05:31
<transcript>: I do not expect anyone to learn sequel.

13:05:31
smilingbig: yeah thdxr LUL

13:05:34
<transcript>: Good Morning. Andreas.

13:05:38
<transcript>: Happy kids. That's right. Smiling. They're happy. I should look at the bright side.

13:05:38
<transcript>: at least are

13:05:40
<transcript>: At least are happy.

13:05:40
<transcript>: hello

13:05:41
oetziofficial: I do want to learn how to make it serverless (with or without aws)

13:05:44
<transcript>: Hello, tardy, your little tiny tardy, but Hello.

13:05:47
<transcript>: Trampoline Park Vibe exactly.

13:05:47
<transcript>: how does that mean

13:05:48
<transcript>: How does that mean.

13:05:48
<transcript>: so

13:05:52
<transcript>: So we do a lot of web traffic.

13:05:52
<transcript>: so

13:05:54
0xcouch: ActiveRecord still the best ORM

13:05:54
thdxr: I thought of a way to offend Adam

13:05:59
<transcript>: So we do have some ads on site that makes some money. We have some deals with teams. We did a deal with ESPN.

13:06:05
<transcript>: We sell merch. Go to the shopmes.com, get you some merch.

13:06:05
<transcript>: not all

13:06:13
<transcript>: Not all I work with at daily three production, self hosted projects using prison. Ohitzi, do you ever deploy it serverlessly like do you deploy it to a lambda function.

13:06:13
<transcript>: where

13:06:17
<transcript>: Where it's so giant that your whole app becomes slow and terrible.

13:06:24
<transcript>: It zoomed in on prisma, ain't it? That's pretty good. So is it actually zooming.

13:06:27
<transcript>: I don't think it's zooming.

13:06:27
oetziofficial: the tech is more interesting than the hoster

13:06:28
xbanki: As someone who HAD to learn SQL when there weren't any ORM tools out there, I think Prisma is super great.

13:06:29
devinda_me: what do you instead ? I saw a library called drizzle

13:06:32
<transcript>: I'm trying to make the faces to get it to Zoom. I don't think the Zoom is working.

13:06:34
oetziofficial: I have not used any lambda yet.

13:06:44
<transcript>: I do want to learn how to make it serverless with without aws active records still the best irm I've heard that a lot. I'm not a ruby guy, but I've heard Active record set the standard.

13:06:44
<transcript>: dax she's not a

13:06:51
<transcript>: Dax, she's not a way to offend me. Tell me more. The tech is more interesting than the hoster. As someone who had to look.

13:06:51
<transcript>: sql when

13:06:52
typosrry: The simplest Lambda whit Prisma is like 50MB deployed LUL

13:06:53
treasonist: Prisma does dataloading automatically for many of their built in methods, p nice feature imo for my graphql API

13:06:58
<transcript>: Sql when they weren't or when there weren't any orm tools out there. I think prisma is super great. Welcome Xbanki to Chat. No prisma or.

13:07:02
<transcript>: Arms are bad. I'm saying prisma is a bad or M. That's all.

13:07:08
<transcript>: I'm not saying I worry Ms are bad or Ms are great. It's great. I'm not saying right sequel. I'm just saying.

13:07:08
<transcript>: prison is huge

13:07:17
<transcript>: Prison is huge and giant and I can't believe in 2023 that it's like the leader in Orm's it's just so bad in the modern way of deploying apps.

13:07:17
<transcript>: what are you doing

13:07:20
oetziofficial: oh yea Prisma IS a BAD ORM, I agree.

13:07:23
smedwardd: SQL is not that bad!

13:07:24
<transcript>: What are you doing? Said I saw a library called drizzle. Yeah, drizzle's. Good. I do. I mean, I'm a diamond of dynamodb guys. So, like, what do I know.

13:07:32
<transcript>: I like interacting with my db through an http API because I'm kind of kind of silly like that.

13:07:32
<transcript>: i

13:07:39
<transcript>: I have not used any Lambda yet the simplest Lambda. What Prisma is like 50 megabyte deployed. It's giant.

13:07:39
<transcript>: it's giant

13:07:39
overra_dev: eh dynamo

13:07:42
smilingbig: do a lot of people like dynamodb?

13:07:47
<transcript>: It's giant and it's fine if you're like running your thing on heroku or whatever. And you've got like a node process. And who cares.

13:07:47
<transcript>: but

13:07:48
oetziofficial: it gives the ease of development, but when things break I have no clue how to fix it. the black box is crazy

13:07:49
thdxr: everyone needs to pay me $1 if they use drizzle

13:07:52
<transcript>: But like the way things are moving towards blowing things.

13:07:52
<transcript>: to ondemand

13:07:53
<transcript>: To ondemand.

13:07:53
<transcript>: compute

13:07:57
<transcript>: Compute. It's just not a great situation.

13:08:07
overra_dev: @thdxr Cheer1

13:08:09
<transcript>: Sequel not that bad dynamo do a lot of people like dynamodb a lot of a lot of people do not the majority of people, but a lot of people do. It's a really fantastic database if you're willing to put up with some.

13:08:09
<transcript>: tradeoffs

13:08:09
blakegreendev: I owe you a $1 @thdxr

13:08:19
<transcript>: Tradeoffs that basically like bad developer experience but xellent runtime characteristics if you're willing to like make that trade off.

13:08:19
<transcript>: then dynamo

13:08:30
<transcript>: Then dynamo's. Great. It gives the ease of development, but when things break, I have no clue how to fix it. The black Box is crazy. Yeah, yeah, that's a problem with orms in general. Everyone needs to pay me $1 if they use drizzle.

13:08:33
dnbull: i just use google sheet for my db Kappa

13:08:38
<transcript>: You're so good, you gotta find a way to access the capitalize financially, on your ability to find new things. Okay. I can actually write some code. What am I doing.

13:08:43
<transcript>: The Inbold Issues, Google sheets.

13:08:47
<transcript>: I know. Dax is a fan of.

13:08:49
vapor__dev: White shirt less gooooo

13:08:50
<transcript>: What's it called airtable.

13:08:50
<transcript>: just

13:08:50
typosrry: Prisma is the leader because all the coverage it gets from dev influencers. So easy to use, almost like a low-code tool, but it's not great.

13:08:54
<transcript>: Just use air table okay RDS database instance.

13:08:54
thdxr: I capitalize on this by not having people in our discord asking about drizzle

13:08:58
thdxr: will save me so much time

13:08:58
smilingbig: dnbull yeah booi

13:09:02
thdxr: er about Prisma

13:09:03
<transcript>: Database instance. From database instance attributes. This is so bad. I hate the. I hate this. Dax, did you say I don't have to do this.

13:09:09
<transcript>: Next.

13:09:09
<transcript>: could

13:09:15
<transcript>: Could you explain? Dax? Why, sure, let's go. Alan. I'm wearing a white shirt today. What is going on.

13:09:15
<transcript>: just woke up

13:09:21
thdxr: I can't explain over text too annoying

13:09:22
<transcript>: Just woke up and shows violent this morning. I was like, everyone feels like they know what's coming on my stream. No.

13:09:22
<transcript>: i'm gonna have it

13:09:27
<transcript>: I'm gonna have it. None of that. We're gonna throw things into a dip.

13:09:28
<transcript>: Dimension today.

13:09:31
devinda_me: adam you dont work with RDS  ? that's kinda what i like about prisma - relationships are v nice

13:09:38
fragaverage: violence is a white shirt? That makes SO much sense

13:09:39
<transcript>: You don't work with RDS.

13:09:39
<transcript>: that's kind of what i like

13:09:43
<transcript>: That's kind of what I like about prison. My relationships are, yeah, I don't work with RDS.

13:09:46
0xcouch: Airtable is great for MVPs. Lets you basically build out a full relational db with visual tools

13:09:50
<transcript>: You can't explain over text.

13:09:51
typosrry: @thdxr soon, when Drizzle will support CockroachDB LUL

13:09:57
<transcript>: To annoying. Oh, you mean like, but did you say I can just leave this up blank? Dax.

13:10:03
<transcript>: I leave security groups blank or something.

13:10:03
joostschuur: I'm actually syncing from Google Sheets for something at work and just finishing moving to a KeystoneJS CMS powered backend (using Prisma) to replace it.

13:10:10
oetziofficial: Dumb question: how many amazon services are out there, and how can I minimize the use of them? maybe @thdxr and SST does that? I am not sure about that

13:10:12
<transcript>: I do hate that after bride all these details. I wish I could just like import it.

13:10:12
<transcript>: using

13:10:13
thdxr: pretty sure you can leave it blank

13:10:15
<transcript>: Using the identifier and be done.

13:10:18
<transcript>: Pretty sure I can leave security groups blank. Okay.

13:10:26
<transcript>: I probably have to provide the instance endpoint address. Why, though why.

13:10:31
<transcript>: The identifier is unique. Why can't just use that.

13:10:33
thdxr: I know why

13:10:36
<transcript>: I got a Google this. Like I feel like this just seems wrong.

13:10:36
<transcript>: cdk

13:10:39
thdxr: it's killing me I want to tell you

13:10:39
<transcript>: Cdk import RDS instance.

13:10:43
thdxr: it's soooo dumb

13:10:45
<transcript>: Just killing you. Just tell me.

13:10:45
thdxr: DUMB

13:10:48
<transcript>: It's so dumb. Just tell me.

13:10:55
<transcript>: From david's Instagram.

13:10:56
thdxr: can I call you

13:10:59

13:11:06
vapor__dev: Ring ring

13:11:09
<transcript>: What.

13:11:13
<transcript>: Can I call you? Yes, please do.

13:11:17
<transcript>: Call me do you want to come on the stream and tell me.

13:11:20
<transcript>: Or use what? Call my cell phone.

13:11:28
thdxr: how easy is it for me to come on the stream

13:11:33
<transcript>: And you can hop in that's easy. Just here.

13:11:36
<transcript>: So, easy.

13:11:36
<transcript>: hang on

13:11:38
<transcript>: Hang on.

13:11:44

13:12:08
<transcript>: that would be

13:12:10
<transcript>: That would be fantastic.

13:12:16
<transcript>: All right, I'm gonna just throw it to the break screens real quick while I get back on, and we'll be right back.

13:14:26
<transcript>: That's. All right, say that stuff. And then staying on for a few more minutes. This is so not super awkward.

13:14:34
<transcript>: Did it work.

13:14:39

13:16:23
<transcript>: No.

13:16:23
<transcript>: that's so

13:16:29
<transcript>: That's so dumb. Why can't they there's other resources. They have a lookup where they can look up the resource or something, right.

13:16:46
<transcript>: That's so dumb.

13:16:47
<transcript>: sorry i'm

00:00:29
wesleycoder: "not after I kill it" got me hard ROFL

00:00:32
<transcript>: You can't. So there's no way for you to do this. Like, could you guys make, like, a custom resource or something.

00:00:38
daglee: We can buy new tickets!

00:00:51
vapor__dev: Guys teacher not here party time

00:01:05
<transcript>: So top of your top? Your roadmap? Is what I just heard? I was a little distracted? Is that we said.

00:01:12
<transcript>: Okay, got it, Mr. Robot. Think so much for the follow zarka. Also, thank you for that follow.

00:01:14
<transcript>: Okay.

00:01:25
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:01:31
<transcript>: So if I'm not using.

00:01:35
<transcript>: It is. Yeah, it's required.

00:01:54
<transcript>: So I guess I need it. I actually do need the security groups because I need to give access to the asterisk construct.

00:01:58
<transcript>: Or I need to put it in the same security group.

00:01:59
joostschuur: Is it me or did the viewer count go up with Dax on? Was at 100, now 200. Just saying.

00:02:03
<transcript>: Yeah. I think I actually do need it.

00:02:08
<transcript>: So I have to put all that stuff in there. That's so dumb. Okay. Well, I guess I'll just do environment variables.

00:02:15
<transcript>: I mean, we just have staging and production, so it's a little easier.

00:02:25
<transcript>: Oh.

00:02:27
<transcript>: Are you serious.

00:02:31
<transcript>: Like I can make the whole stack function async and then do whatever I want.

00:02:36
typosrry: @joostschuur because content quality increased by 200% LUL

00:02:44
<transcript>: That is cool. Okay, we're gonna do that. I'm gonna try. That. Sounds fun.

00:02:44
<transcript>: i can get on board

00:02:46
<transcript>: I can get on board with that. Okay.

00:02:46
<transcript>: cool

00:02:54
<transcript>: Cool. Well, aside from killing my stream like three times and making this all take five times longer. This was fun. We should do it again.

00:02:58
<transcript>: Yeah. No, it was. It was very helpful. Thanks.

00:03:01
joostschuur: Dax should stream right after this.

00:03:01
<transcript>: Okay.

00:03:01
<transcript>: does anything

00:03:05
<transcript>: Does anything work? Does my stream still work.

00:03:05
<transcript>: no

00:03:06
<transcript>: No.

00:03:06
<transcript>: it's

00:03:10
<transcript>: It's all broken. I don't know even how to fix it.

00:03:10
<transcript>: there

00:03:13

00:03:13
<transcript>: all right

00:03:14
<transcript>: All right. Are we good.

00:03:14
<transcript>: sic

00:03:15
fragaverage: Does Dax charge per minute?

00:03:18
daglee: Fixed

00:03:27
<transcript>: Sic you're able to reset someone notice that it reset the number of attempts that you can spin points for the macbook. So there you go. You're welcome. Did it all for a reason. There was a reason.

00:03:35
<transcript>: Infinitely loop transition. Yeah, I don't know what happened. Weird. The stream crash wants to Linux user join the call exactly. Couch. Exactly.

00:03:36
thdxr: I crashed adam's stream for you guys

00:03:38
wesleycoder: I would spend more points if I had them LoL

00:03:39

<transcript>: Macos audio. Okay, come on. I'm just scrolling now. Just trying to catch up. I like to watch every new person into our chat. It's important to me that they feel welcome.

00:03:52
<transcript>: yes

00:03:59
<transcript>: Yes, you can you can do these redeems now and you can try to win a MacBook singer tishawn, thank you for that follow.

00:03:59
<transcript>: so

00:04:05
<transcript>: So if you redeem it, there's a very tiny chance you will win a macbook. It's very tiny.

00:04:05
<transcript>: but

00:04:08
<transcript>: But there is a chance.

00:04:08
<transcript>: to access

00:04:12
<transcript>: To access stream right after this. He will, I think deuce. He probably will.

00:04:15
<transcript>: This DAX started for a minute.

00:04:15
<transcript>: so we're gonna

00:04:19
<transcript>: So we're gonna try and do the kind of exotic thing, dax. Just.

00:04:19
<transcript>: crashed

00:04:25
<transcript>: Crashed down the street for you guys, the kind of exotic thing that dax just suggested, which is make our stack a singing.

00:04:25
<transcript>: and then

00:04:31
<transcript>: And then do whatever we want. We're gonna call the sdk and we're gonna look up the rds instance, and then we're going to.

00:04:37
<transcript>: Use all the properties of it. I don't know how I'm gonna do that and make it play nice with the cdk.

00:04:44
<transcript>: What did I want to do with the rds instance? I wanted to add an rds proxy.

00:04:47
<transcript>: Data, proxy, or whatever it's called.

00:04:51
<transcript>: And then I'm gonna need to ultimately give access.

00:04:55
<transcript>: To the astro site.

00:05:00
<transcript>: This is a lot of work. Sometimes I approach a problem, and I'm like.

00:05:02
joostschuur: Thanks to the new redeem command Adam missed how to pronounce my name 🤣

00:05:08
<transcript>: There's hardly anything to it. And then it takes weeks. This time, I'm like, this is a lot of work. So who knows how one's gonna take.

00:05:15
<transcript>: Thanks to the new redeem Command. Adam missed how to pronounce my name. Oh, no, juice. Am I saying your name wrong.

00:05:19
thdxr: yoast

13:25:10
a_maher938: worked

13:25:14
<transcript>: I just can't have dax on anymore. Apparently, if I have a guest on everything is broken. How come you're using obs webscont instead of just the event listeners? What are the event listeners? Oh, instead of the.

13:25:23
thdxr: no not webhook

13:25:24
<transcript>: Websocket or webhook. I just got tired of having to run in groc and that whole thing for the web hooks. I'd rather just like if I can just connect, I'd better just connect that way.

13:25:29
joostschuur: @daglee I'm very Schuur it's Yoast (for non Dutch speakers anyway)

13:25:30
guidok2a: remember when rox discovered it was yoast instead of whatever he used for a literal year LUL @joostschuur

13:25:31
<transcript>: Oh, not webhook. What are event listeners.

13:25:34
thdxr: you can `window.onEvent("sceheChanged")` or whatever

13:25:36
<transcript>: Oh, it's yoast.

13:25:39
<transcript>: It's yoast.

13:26:31
<transcript>: For one thing, dax. I'm not using.

13:26:43

<transcript>: so

13:26:44
<transcript>: So.

13:26:44
<transcript>: i maybe that's

<transcript>: I maybe that's why I don't do that.

13:26:46
<transcript>: but i didn't

13:27:24
<transcript>: Like I have that problem. Sometimes I think, like, in my botching your name, or is that not your name? Like is that just.

13:27:35
<transcript>: Some kind of a handle that you go by pseudonym or something, and I didn't. I hadn't formed any opinions on whether yose name was his actual name or.

13:27:35
<transcript>: just

13:27:56

13:27:56
<transcript>: oh yeah so

13:28:01
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. So I filled out a College, and then I've been self thought, I guess since that point.

13:28:22
joostschuur: I also failed out of college.

13:28:24

13:29:17
<transcript>: Let's see. Can I do it like this.

13:29:21

13:29:25

13:29:36
thdxr: yeah away `app.stack`

13:29:38
thdxr: await

13:29:42

13:30:49
<transcript>: Maybe I should consider making it serverless.

13:30:49
<transcript>: because

13:30:52
<transcript>: Because we just have all kinds of issues.

13:30:56
joostschuur: @captainsikay Yeah, but I like the lowercase look.

13:30:58
<transcript>: Database instance from instance attributes. So what I want to do is basically look up the.

13:30:58

13:31:00
<transcript>: Details. So I don't have to do all this.

13:31:00
<transcript>: i'm gonna do

13:31:10
<transcript>: I'm gonna do that through the sdk. This is so much work. Vpc from lookup so right there. I'm doing a lookup. I wish they would let me do a lookup from database instance.

13:31:13
<transcript>: Wish.

13:31:26

<transcript>: I'm just gonna try. You know what, dax? It occurred to me, like, the Internet is so fluid and like, no one has all the context. I could make up any reality I want. I could I could convince people of something like that that I actually tweeted all lowercase first and that you copied me. And they probably believe me some some percentage of people would.

13:31:58
<transcript>: Interesting.

13:31:58
<transcript>: the internet

13:32:02
smilingbig: yeah 100%

13:32:03
oetziofficial: SpOnGeBoB CaSe is the worst

13:32:04

13:32:13
smilingbig: LUL

13:32:13

fragaverage: ^ and a scammer

13:32:14
thdxr: and alex debrie is a dynamo noob

thdxr: yeah scammer

13:32:31
joostschuur: In Germany (at least 20 years ago) spelling things in only lowercase suggested an affinity with the far left/anarchist subculture.

13:32:36
<transcript>: Alex debris dynamoob. Yeah, he might not like that one. His whole business kind of depends on being a tangible TV expert. You should probably check. Check with Alex. That couldn't have any damage cause. Like we just discussed. People will believe it.

13:32:37
vimcerf: but kebab-case isn't valid for hash-tags?

13:32:37

13:32:55
<transcript>: Yeah, we can't write our variables in kebab. We need to petition the javascript people, whoever makes those javascript rules that we should have kebab casing.

13:33:02
<transcript>: In Germany at least 20 years ago. Spelling things in only lowercase suggestions suggested an affinity with the Far Left and arcus subculture. Interesting.

<transcript>: Sure you won't like that one can't write my variables. Yeah, yeah. I'm trying to ruin his business. Dax. That's just awful. You're not really trying to ruin his business.

terawatthour: scam is the only way to go in the modern society

13:34:51
<transcript>: Rds is that the I've never used the SDK for RDS anyways. Sdk RDS.

13:34:53
<transcript>: Oh no version three.

13:34:57
<transcript>: Client rds. This is a first.

13:35:01
<transcript>: This is a first.

13:35:04
<transcript>: What can I say? Rigged.

13:35:06

13:35:20
joostschuur: I think Adam just doesn't want to do the 1 on 1 calls at  50k ;)

13:35:26
<transcript>: Yes, I have to buy a macbook for somebody, but like, somebody just won a very tiny chance. And that's gonna be cool.

13:35:29
terawatthour: you want to get excited and make me win?

13:35:33

<transcript>: That's some Galaxy brain stuff right there.

13:35:51
<transcript>: You want to get excited and make me win? I mean, I won't be excited if I just give it to you. I'll be excited if you win this very tiny chance.

13:35:59
terawatthour: i have a different perspective on that

13:36:00
thdxr: oh look you're on the v3 docs - enjoy getting zero insight from them

13:36:00

thdxr: should probably just get chatgpt

13:36:15
<transcript>: Oh, look, you're on the V Three, docs. Enjoy getting zero insight from them. Yeah, these are so bad. I only came here to make sure the name was Client RDS.

13:37:12
<transcript>: Thank you so much. I love prime subs. It just feels like such a vot of confidence, like you only have one of them. And you gave it to me. And I appreciate that a whole lot equals new RDS client. What's actually used the lsp here. Let's just ignore Copilot for a SEC. Sometimes I wish it would just ignore copilot RDS.

13:37:12

<transcript>: When something goes wrong.

13:39:16
<transcript>: whoa

13:39:24
<transcript>: Whoa, how is the copilot in your autocomplete? Oh, dax, you don't do it that way. Oh, yeah, I added that there's a cmp plugin for code.

13:39:24
<transcript>: and

13:39:28
<transcript>: And you can inject copy Suggestions into your autocomplete.

13:39:28
<transcript>: sometimes

13:39:32
thdxr: cooool

13:39:35
<transcript>: Sometimes it's kind of annoying those if I'm being honest. Ten minutes so far to install a new package. Okay, okay, let's not keep track. Dax.

13:39:35
<transcript>: let's not

13:39:39
<transcript>: Let's not just start a timer every time I start a new task.

13:39:47
<transcript>: I've been saving up for 100k in stream. Redeeming another channel. Wow, you can end the stream for 1000 points. That's awesome.

13:41:40
<transcript>: Oh, topovel away? What.

13:42:58
daglee: You can also make manual triggers for cmp if you like that. I currently have <C-x><C-m> to complete email addresses, <C-x><C-s> to get spelling suggestions and <C-x><C-a> for AI.

13:42:59

13:44:59
<transcript>: Yeah. Restart ts server. Yes. Is lsp. Restart.

13:45:03

13:45:47

13:45:58

13:47:02
<transcript>: and

13:47:10

So that's my that's my new product. My new process, drama. Welcome to Chat Stream. Production is super clean. Yeah. I've spent a lot of time on it. I would love to be somebody who could just, like, when you say that, just be like, oh, thank you.

<transcript>: but

13:47:55

13:48:01
ezpzstreamz: nice, it's doing pretty good then haha

13:48:02
<transcript>: I get that a lot. Gambling equals predictions on twitch. Oh, I got you fiction.

13:48:14
<transcript>: It is doing really good easy. You start with a good album and then more music. More good music will follow. So if I can console live that now when would I see that.

thdxr: @typosrry we focus on serverless and GCP's serverless stuff isn't there yet

14:00:44
<transcript>: It's okay. It's just the reality, like, you put yourself out there. You're gonna find people that resonate with you as a person. But if you're just yourself, eventually, you'll find people that like being around you. So I think that's the thing you gotta, like, have a thing that draws people in.

14:00:44
<transcript>: and then

14:00:44
the_true_jinx: i actually watch you because you seem super humble and I like that

14:00:50
<transcript>: And then once they're in, they'll stick around or not, based on whether they kind of resonate with you as a person.

14:00:50
<transcript>: i don't

14:00:52
typosrry: got it

14:00:53
1camou: what is the city behind you?

14:00:53
thdxr: and it's way better to just focus on one provider to deliver quality

14:00:54
<transcript>: I don't know. Adam. Sounds kind of critch. Stop it. Dax.

14:00:54
<transcript>: the

14:00:55
<transcript>: The cry's thing.

14:00:55
<transcript>: yesterday was

14:00:57
<transcript>: Yesterday was kind of dirty.

14:01:06
<transcript>: How long are you streaming till today? Might start later. Actually, it's so funny. I'm gonna stream an hour later because I started an hour later. So I'm gonna do.

14:01:11
<transcript>: Tell whatever time that is Eleven My time. Noon your time.

<transcript>: tax

14:01:11
<transcript>: Tax.

14:01:14
<transcript>: Just some of the stream tell.

14:01:14
<transcript>: so two more hours

14:01:21
<transcript>: So two more hours. I'm gonna be on here. Two more hours. Maybe we'll actually get connected to the database in 2 hours. Probably not. Honestly. Probably not.

14:01:23
<transcript>: Wait, you're white.

14:01:28
<transcript>: If you don't mind, I would like to ask why you're not going. Okay, you guys on the.

14:01:28
<transcript>: gcp

14:01:30
<transcript>: Gcp.

14:01:30
<transcript>: actually

<transcript>: Actually watch you because you seem super humble, and I like that.

14:01:34
<transcript>: well true j

14:01:38
<transcript>: Well true jinx, I appreciate that it's gonna go to my head now. So.

14:01:39
pablovgdev: @adamdotdev do you work full time in your own projects or do you also have a day job?

14:01:43
<transcript>: It might have worked against you and your viewership. Goals.

14:01:45
thdxr: Adam: I am the most humble

14:01:48
<transcript>: What is the city behind you? It's a lego city.

14:01:52
<transcript>: That's another one of my thing is I have a lego City behind my head.

14:01:52
<transcript>: it's

14:01:59
thdxr: somehow this is his day job

14:02:03
<transcript>: It's unique to me. I built them. It was a lot of effort. I lift them. That was even more effort. And now it makes a nice little. They've got a little soft glow with the bokeh.

14:02:03
<transcript>: just like

14:02:05
<transcript>: Just like little twinkle lights behind my head.

14:02:05
<transcript>: yeah

14:02:05
thdxr: 30min to install a package

14:02:07
<transcript>: Yeah, I think having a good background.

14:02:08
statsndata: Do you already have the Mac Pro on hand?

14:02:12
<transcript>: And investing in your production can help on Twitch.

14:02:15
2r1ngs: Can you tell me about your job?

14:02:22
<transcript>: Pablo. Welcome to Chat. Do you work full time on your own project? Or do you also have a day job.

14:02:22
<transcript>: my day

14:02:24
<transcript>: My day job is statmes.com.

14:02:24
<transcript>: i started snap

14:02:25
typosrry: @thdxr LUL

14:02:26
<transcript>: I started snaps back in 2014.

14:02:31
<transcript>: And we we are like a sports statistic site.

14:02:35
<transcript>: We're a lot of things, but that's the main thing.

14:02:37
<transcript>: That's what I do with my day job.

14:02:37
<transcript>: adam i am

14:02:40
<transcript>: Adam, I am the most humble. It's true. Somebody has to be.

14:02:43
<transcript>: Somehow, this is just.

14:02:50
<transcript>: 30 minutes from salt package. You're gonna keep bringing that one up. Are you DAX.

14:02:50
<transcript>: do you already have the

14:02:52
<transcript>: Do you already have the Mac pro.

14:02:52
<transcript>: on hand

14:02:53
<transcript>: On hand.

14:02:53
<transcript>: so set some

14:02:57
<transcript>: So set some data. I have the Mac Pro on hand.

14:03:00
<transcript>: I sent it back.

14:03:10
<transcript>: I didn't even do the video. Well, I recorded some stuff, but I was like, this is dumb. It's just. It's not a good computer for anything. Being a developer, it's really just for video editing.

14:03:12
venedie: Good production is an underrated term here LUL

14:03:15
<transcript>: So I sent the 500 dollar Mac Pro back. I have not been refunded yet.

14:03:15
<transcript>: and it's been

14:03:21
<transcript>: And it's been weeks and apples in an ominous email where they're like, we need bank details to refund you.

14:03:21
<transcript>: like

14:03:29
<transcript>: Like, why didn't you ask me? About three weeks ago. So we'll see hope that I get my money back first time, Jack. Welcome to Chat. Two rings. Can you tell me about your job.

14:03:33
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm a software developer for staff.

14:03:38
<transcript>: Individual contributor. Now I used to be the CTO.

14:03:40
<transcript>: Back.

14:03:40
<transcript>: for five years

14:03:46
<transcript>: For five years from 2014. Judge 19. I don't know why I'm telling you that that's way too much detail.

14:03:48
<transcript>: I just write software.

14:03:48
<transcript>: right now

14:03:51
<transcript>: Right now we're rewriting status.

14:03:54
mcmx20: Hi Adam, I'm Sergio you made me want to create a Twitch account.

14:03:56
<transcript>: And I'm doing a lot of frontend work. Apparently. I'm a friend and developer.

14:03:57
pablovgdev: cool, I would also love to work in my own projects/companies, but I think the transition from dev to business man is very hard, any tips?

14:04:00
statsndata: hahah so... so far you've Donated a Mac Pro ?

14:04:10
<transcript>: Good production is an underrated term. Here. It's right.

14:04:20
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Mcmx. I'm Adam Or. Hi, Adam. I'm Sergio. You made me want to create a twitch account. Really.

14:04:23
<transcript>: Do Please Do create a twitch account.

14:04:25
<transcript>: I love seeing.

14:04:26
geneticbobcat: howdy

14:04:28
<transcript>: New people.

14:04:28
<transcript>: venture into

14:04:29
drama321: Soy dev as prime calls it lol

14:04:39
<transcript>: Venture into this world. I think it's great for the devs. That stream. I think it's great for the devs at Watch devs. Who stream? I think it's a good opportunity to learn something. Maybe don't spend all of your days watching people on Twitch.

14:04:39
1camou: do you press a button for the zoom on your face?

14:04:43
<transcript>: Things good to pop in.

14:04:47
<transcript>: I would also love to work on my own projects, companies.

14:04:47
<transcript>: and trans

14:04:50
<transcript>: And transition from Dev to businessman is very hard. Any tips.

14:04:50
<transcript>: i still don't feel like

14:04:51
gustabo107: do you plan some soccer statistics in statmuse?

14:04:56
<transcript>: I still don't feel like I'm a businessman. I think I found a good cofounder who is a businessman.

14:05:00
<transcript>: And knew how to leverage my Dev skills.

14:05:00
<transcript>: but i still

14:05:02
<transcript>: But I still don't feel like I'm like a.

14:05:02
<transcript>: businessman

14:05:04
<transcript>: Businessman.

14:05:04
greetten: im here to learn HeyGuys

14:05:06
venedie: How many cameras you have in your setup now? Looks like 4 cams and a slider? POGGERS

14:05:07
<transcript>: I don't think I'm very good at businessy, things.

14:05:11
<transcript>: So you've donated a Mac pro.

14:05:18
<transcript>: I hope not. I hope I didn't donate a Mac Pro back to Apple. Hope I get paid back.

14:05:23
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Genetic. Bobcat. Howdy.

14:05:23
<transcript>: that's an interesting

14:05:25
<transcript>: That's an interesting username.

14:05:29
<transcript>: Soy dev is prime. Calls it that's right.

14:05:29
<transcript>: i

14:05:32
<transcript>: I am very much a soy Dev.

14:05:32
<transcript>: do you press a

14:05:36
<transcript>: Do you press a button for the Zoom on your face? Now it's supposed to do it when I make goofy faces.

14:05:36
<transcript>: to make like dramatic

14:05:39
<transcript>: To make like dramatic effects so.

14:05:39
<transcript>: but it doesn't

14:05:43
<transcript>: But it doesn't work right now and it keeps zooming in randomly. It's very broken.

14:05:44
securibee: How do you decide which sports to include for statmuse @adamdotdev?

14:05:46
<transcript>: It's like day to day? I never know what it's gonna do.

14:05:46
<transcript>: it does something different

14:05:47
typosrry: I think @statsndata asks about the giveaway MBP LUL

14:05:48
geneticbobcat: What is your preferred stack?

14:05:49
<transcript>: It does something different every time I turn it on.

14:06:02
<transcript>: You plan some soccer statistics, so, yes, we're gonna add epo European soccer, and we do plan to add cricut IPL as well. I'm here to learn. I'm here to teach. Maybe I'm here to hopefully teach you something.

14:06:06
<transcript>: Maybe not on purpose sometimes, but.

14:06:13
<transcript>: Vanity. How many cameras do you have in your setup? Now for cams? Yes, that's right. Four cams of slider. Exactly.

14:06:18
<transcript>: Secure the how do you decide which sports include for Snap music? So we started as mba only.

14:06:21
<transcript>: And.

14:06:21
<transcript>: here's

14:06:26
<transcript>: Here's like a year before we added the next Port, which is NFL.

14:06:26
<transcript>: and then

14:06:29
<transcript>: And then Baseball. And then Hockey. And then we added PGA.

14:06:32
<transcript>: And then we built a financial.

14:06:32
<transcript>: product

14:06:39
<transcript>: Product like searching finance stats. So like stock prices and volume and all this kind of stuff.

14:06:43
<transcript>: But those are the things we've done so far.

14:06:47
dmmulroy: F1 next

14:06:51
<transcript>: And how do we decide it was really just like, how how much access to the data? How hard is it to get a good data set? That's the main.

14:06:51
<transcript>: consideration so

14:06:59
<transcript>: Consideration. So like College sports, we would love to College football. And like March managed right now, calls basketballs really big in the us.

14:06:59
<transcript>: we'd love

14:07:16
<transcript>: We'd love to do them. College stats are so hard to get ahold of like because each like each University and each conference tracks stats differently and across different time horizons. Like finding a good, comprehensive data set for 200 plus teams.

14:07:16
<transcript>: is really hard

14:07:17
<transcript>: Is really hard.

14:07:24
<transcript>: So our statistician worked like proof of concept on how he would maybe piece together a good College sports database.

14:07:24
<transcript>: and

14:07:25
securibee: Have you ever looked into MMA/UFC?

14:07:35
<transcript>: And just for satisfies, it really depends on like because it's the natural language thing. Like you're asking questions of the data. It makes it really hard when the data set is very.

14:07:40
<transcript>: Heterogeneous. Okay, this is the word I'm gonna use.

14:07:40
<transcript>: it's probably

14:07:46
<transcript>: It's probably terrible. We're describe it. But when it's not consistent across all the teams.

14:07:54
<transcript>: It makes it difficult because of the way we do natural language stuff. So like comparing records and colleges harder. Just everything about it is harder when you have that many teams.

14:07:54
<transcript>: i

14:07:58
<transcript>: I don't know. Nobody asked about Call Sports. Why did I tell you all that.

14:07:58
<transcript>: but that's

14:08:04
<transcript>: But that's why we haven't added College course yet, I guess. And that's why we'll probably add European soccer first.

14:08:11
statsndata: @typosrry bet my whole balance today

14:08:13
<transcript>: Have you looked into mma UFC? I have not personally, but I'm sure Satisficient did if there's data out there and it's possible, I'm sure eventually we'll get there.

14:08:19
<transcript>: Bet your whole balance today.

14:08:22
<transcript>: No one is want a MacBook yet.

14:08:22
<transcript>: not

14:08:23
<transcript>: Not yet.

14:08:23
<transcript>: but

14:08:29
<transcript>: But let's get back to it I've got 2 hours here and I would love to.

14:08:34
<transcript>: I would love to actually get something done. We're gonna connect our real database.

14:08:37
<transcript>: We're gonna connect to.

14:08:39
<transcript>: Start the music over.

14:08:46
<transcript>: So we're gonna actually connect to the production or the.

14:08:48
<transcript>: Stat muse profile.

14:08:54
<transcript>: I guess I'm gonna have to do some stuff here. Like.

14:09:01
<transcript>: I'm gonna go fuzzy for a second. I need to look at my credential files. Aws.

14:09:07
<transcript>: Aws.

14:09:07
<transcript>: config

14:09:08
<transcript>: Config.

14:09:08
<transcript>: see what i've got

14:09:10
<transcript>: See what I've got set up.

14:09:15
<transcript>: Nothing for stat. Muse.

14:09:15
<transcript>: so i need to set

14:09:17
<transcript>: So I need to set up my.

14:09:17
<transcript>: stamp

14:09:19
<transcript>: Stamp use.

14:09:24
lesabotsy: Is there a API to use to get data from statmuse? If yes how much is it for a random dude on the internet?

14:09:24
<transcript>: I can turn off fuzzy.

14:09:26
kryotoboi: Oh Fuzzy didn't work. We saw the file Adam. Too bad

14:09:28
<transcript>: I need to set up my staff. Use SSO.

14:09:36
<transcript>: Let's see, let's see.

14:09:36
<transcript>: i

14:09:39
<transcript>: I have set up ssl. I just haven't set it up for.

14:09:39
<transcript>: i am

14:09:41
<transcript>: I am Identity Center now.

14:09:43
kryotoboi: The hack is underway now

14:09:50
<transcript>: I'm pretty sure I've set this up, haven't I users.

14:09:50
<transcript>: yeah

14:09:52
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

14:09:55
<transcript>: Eight of US accounts.

14:09:55
<transcript>: i

14:09:58
<transcript>: I've got to give access here.

14:09:59
otterlord_: damn, the pixel mode is cool

14:10:00
<transcript>: To.

14:10:04
<transcript>: Our production.

14:10:06
<transcript>: Management account.

14:10:12
<transcript>: Okay. Just like that.

14:10:24
<transcript>: Otter Lord, welcome to Chat. The Pixel Mother is cool. Yeah, I got that from Rockscodes. He had a tutorial on how to do that.

14:10:31
<transcript>: Is there an api to use to get data from San F? Yes. How much is it for a random job on the Internet so lessa we're in the middle of talking about.

14:10:31
<transcript>: how to add

14:10:32
<transcript>: How to add.

14:10:32
<transcript>: how

14:10:36
<transcript>: How to add an api so there's not one today.

14:10:36
<transcript>: but

14:10:48
<transcript>: But we are looking to add one. And what would be really helpful to me, lesa, is to know, like, what do you want to do with it? Because we get people that scrape the side, obviously, a lot. They just want the historical data. But.

14:10:48
<transcript>: in your perfect

14:10:53
<transcript>: In your perfect world. If you had an api for Statmes, what would you do with it? I'm curious.

14:10:58
<transcript>: Oh, you saw a file? Uhoh.

14:10:58
<transcript>: fuzzy

14:11:00
<transcript>: Fuzzy didn't work.

14:11:00
<transcript>: it's possible

14:11:02
<transcript>: It's possible. Very possible.

14:11:05
kryotoboi: Build another statmuse in Solid LUL

14:11:08
<transcript>: Okay, so we assigned my user. Now I can do stat muse.

14:11:10
dodolkecik: statmuse got dark mode?

14:11:14
<transcript>: Yeah, here we go. We're gonna configure the cli.

14:11:18
<transcript>: Build another statme using solid.

14:11:25
statsndata: Is there a place to submit long form content about suggestions for the API?

14:11:26
<transcript>: Statinis got dark mode. We're gonna add it Dodo that's actually it's in the works.

14:11:26
<transcript>: okay so

14:11:31
<transcript>: Okay. So I want to configure for this one right here. So we're gonna do let's see.

14:11:37
<transcript>: If I can remember how to do this aws, SSO configure.

14:11:38
<transcript>: Nope.

14:11:38
<transcript>: aws

14:11:43
<transcript>: Aws, sso. What do we do? Get a list, accounts.

14:11:48
<transcript>: Aws, sso, help.

14:11:54
<transcript>: I thought you could do this.

14:11:56
greetten: how much work is it to add dark mode to a website? curious

14:11:58
<transcript>: I think it's something else.

14:12:02
<transcript>: Is it just aws, configure.

14:12:06
<transcript>: Get roll credentials.

14:12:12
<transcript>: Aws, configure oh, configure SSL.

14:12:12
<transcript>: that's a

14:12:14
<transcript>: That's a that's.

14:12:14
blakegreendev: leapp is sooo much easier...

14:12:15
<transcript>: A trip.

14:12:15
<transcript>: sso

14:12:19
<transcript>: Sso session name we're gonna do stap news.

14:12:21
<transcript>: Prod.

14:12:25
<transcript>: Start. Url.

14:12:25
<transcript>: is

14:12:26
<transcript>: Is.

14:12:26
<transcript>: this one

14:12:27
<transcript>: This one.

14:12:33
<transcript>: I don't want that trailing nonsense.

14:12:39
<transcript>: A Region A Region USD one.

14:12:46
<transcript>: What? Sso registration scopes? I don't know. I've never seen that.

14:12:46
<transcript>: never seen

14:12:48
<transcript>: Never seen that.

14:12:48
<transcript>: how much work

14:12:50
<transcript>: How much work is it to add dark modular website.

14:12:53
<transcript>: It's not too bad.

14:12:53
<transcript>: it's

14:12:54
<transcript>: It's.

14:13:01
<transcript>: Usually you can do stuff at the top level and get most of it like just with the typography and the background colors and everything.

14:13:04
<transcript>: It depends on how good your design system is.

14:13:05
system1100: does AWS have some edge solutions?

14:13:05
lesabotsy: Well personally I just like to mess around with stats to make predictions about sports, but ideally it's for fantasy league stuff. And also I like to make visualization, more graphics, less tables

14:13:13
<transcript>: Like if you're app is mostly just like a bunch of ad hoc styling all over the place.

14:13:13
<transcript>: it's gonna be

14:13:15
oleksii_lisovyi: 0/

14:13:15
<transcript>: It's gonna be more painful if you're.

14:13:27
<transcript>: Like has a pretty structured approach to design where most of the styling is not like, you don't have background color. Set an individual components that are nested deep within.

14:13:27
<transcript>: the

14:13:32
<transcript>: The hierarchy of the UI. It's gonna be a lot easier. It just kind of depends on your UI.

14:13:32
<transcript>: so for

14:13:35
<transcript>: So for ours. Probably hard. We built it like eight years ago.

14:13:45
otterlord_: @Greetten 0 extra effort if you offer it to start 🙃

14:13:47
<transcript>: Leap is so much easier. Oh yeah. Blake, you told me Leap is good. I even have a tab open for it. Is there a place to submit long form content about suggestions for the API.

14:13:50
<transcript>: Just here. Send it to me.

14:13:52
<transcript>: Long form content, I guess.

14:13:56
<transcript>: No, but there should be send it to.

14:13:56
<transcript>: adam

14:13:58
<transcript>: Adam.

14:13:58
<transcript>: madam or

14:13:59
<transcript>: Madam, or Dev.

14:14:03
<transcript>: I don't have a sat mese email address set up anymore.

14:14:03
<transcript>: that would

14:14:10
<transcript>: That would have been way more official sounding, and that's what I was gonna say, like, Adam atsamus.com. But I don't have that anymore. So just. Yeah.

14:14:12
<transcript>: Send it to.

14:14:12
<transcript>: me

14:14:14
<transcript>: Me.

14:14:17
greetten: @otterlord_ that makes sense!

14:14:25
<transcript>: I would gladly take your suggestions. How much work is it to add? Dartmouth. I already read that. Welcome to Chat System. Does aws have some edge solutions? Yeah, they have some edge compute. So.

14:14:25
<transcript>: there's

14:14:28
<transcript>: There's like they have a cdn cloud front.

14:14:28
<transcript>: for

14:14:32
<transcript>: For serving content at the edge, and then they have.

14:14:32
<transcript>: what do they have

14:14:32
statsndata: I'll drop a link to a gist

14:14:36
<transcript>: What do they have? They have like Lambda edge. You can run Lambda functions at edge.

14:14:36
<transcript>: they have

14:14:38
<transcript>: They have.

14:14:38
<transcript>: cloud

14:14:43
<transcript>: Cloud functions. I think they're called that are functions that run in the cdn, like in cloudfront.

14:14:43
<transcript>: at the

14:15:02
<transcript>: At the actual edge. Lambda edge is like a regional edge. Does that make sense? It's not fully at the edge. I think there's 18. It's like each region or something. But then cloud front functions are just cloud functions. I don't remember what they're called. They run at the actual edge. Like all 200, whatever edge locations.

14:15:02
<transcript>: anyway

14:15:06
<transcript>: Anyway. Yeah, there's some edge stuff. Aws. Has some edge stuff.

14:15:16
<transcript>: Personally, I just like to mess with stats, to make predictions about sports, but ideally it's for fantasy League stuff. Also, I like to make visualization more graphics, less tables. Yeah. No, that's something.

14:15:16
<transcript>: we should consider

14:15:17
<transcript>: We should consider lessa.

14:15:17
<transcript>: we're definitely

14:15:23
<transcript>: We're definitely interested in making an API, and giving people access to an API.

14:15:28
<transcript>: I'm sure it would be usage based so for someone like you it'd be affordable.

14:15:31
<transcript>: We're more thinking about like the.

14:15:31
<transcript>: b

14:15:34
<transcript>: B to B probably with the api. But.

14:15:40
aisebaxp: Hi there, what about Cloudflare? Free tier seems to be fine

14:15:41
<transcript>: Yeah. We've had a lot of those requests in the past, like people in the power, their fantasy spreadsheet. And then when you use Status api, like we've had those kind of questions.

14:15:44
<transcript>: I'm thinking that's something we should support.

14:16:04
<transcript>: I'll drop a link to a gist that works. That welcome to Chat. I stay. I seba. Hi there. What about Cloudflare free tier? Seems to be fine. Huffers. Great. I am not a big Cloudflare user because I'm just. I use liaf, but it's one of the things I want to use it more. I've used it for little things, but I've.

14:16:04
<transcript>: not really

14:16:19
<transcript>: Not really gone all in on building a full fledged app on cloudflare, but I think it's there. I think you can and it's worth exploring. Mcm thanks so much for the follow and also AI seba. I appreciate those. I don't know if I saw GE.

14:16:20
<transcript>: geia lo

14:16:20
<transcript>: geia lore

14:16:25
<transcript>: Geia lore Gelor. Thank you for the follow. I missed that amongst all the macbook files.

14:16:25
<transcript>: i'm sorry

14:16:37
<transcript>: I'm sorry, macbook. Redemptions. Okay. My brain. My brain. What is this? Sso registration scopes? Where's dax? When you need them. Sso registration scopes? What are you talking about.

14:16:43
<transcript>: I've never been asked this question before.

14:16:46
<transcript>: Sso Account access.

14:16:51
<transcript>: You can use reuse sso session configurations.

14:16:51
<transcript>: what are other things

14:16:53
<transcript>: What are other things I might put in here.

14:17:00
<transcript>: For listing accounts and roles.

14:17:10
<transcript>: I'm gonna leave it blank, I think shared aws, config file setting.

14:17:10
<transcript>: a common limit

14:17:31
<transcript>: A common limit list of valid scope strings to be authorized for the sso session scopes authorized access to Immunity Center Barrier tokenauthorized endpoints minimum scope of S so account actually must be granted to get a refresh chokem back from the iam Identity Center service setting doesn't apply to the legacy nonrefession configuration tokens issued using the legacy configuration or limited scope that implicitly.

14:17:31
<transcript>: interesting

14:17:32
<transcript>: Interesting.

14:17:32
<transcript>: things with the follow

14:17:33
<transcript>: Things with the follow.

14:17:33
<transcript>: var

14:17:35
oleksii_lisovyi: What's that MacBook deal? Any comment to check out details?

14:17:37
<transcript>: Varn? Varkon.

14:17:37
<transcript>: okay

14:17:40
oleksii_lisovyi: *command

14:17:42
<transcript>: Okay, let's I'm just gonna do what they I guess that's the default. I'm just gonna do the default.

14:17:42
<transcript>: it's gonna

14:17:44
<transcript>: It's gonna ask me to.

14:17:46
<transcript>: Allow.

14:17:46
dofha: i'm new in aws cloud, should i start with cdk or sst ? I'm afraid that sst is too high level and that I don't understand too much what is going on in the background

14:17:47
<transcript>: Oh.

14:17:47
<transcript>: interesting

14:17:48
<transcript>: Interesting.

14:17:50
<transcript>: Is this this is new.

14:17:58
<transcript>: Is it gonna just refresh? And I don't have to keep refreshing the sodium session. The soion what's going off my brain.

14:18:01
<transcript>: What's the macbook deal? Any kind.

14:18:12
<transcript>: You have a very tiny chance, so win a macbook. If you redeem that thing for a thousand points, you can only redeem it twice.

14:18:12
<transcript>: every stream

14:18:13
<transcript>: Every stream.

14:18:13
<transcript>: because i just

14:18:16
<transcript>: Because I just don't want people spamming at the entire stream.

14:18:16
<transcript>: man oh

14:18:20
<transcript>: Man. Oh, think of the follow. But if you redeem it.

14:18:27
<transcript>: Somebody one of these days is gonna actually win a macbook, and I'm gonna ship you a brand new macbook. That's it. That's the that's the whole thing.

14:18:37
<transcript>: I'm new in aws cloud. Should I start with cdk or sst? I'm afraid that ssd is too high level and that I don't understand too much of what is going on in the background.

14:18:37
<transcript>: no

14:18:40
oleksii_lisovyi: Unlucky

14:18:42
<transcript>: No, I think ssd is way better than starting with cdk.

14:18:42
<transcript>: for the reason

14:18:50
jfaux: unlucky, together, alone

14:19:00
<transcript>: For the reason that you stated, which is that it's higher level and you're going to Wade into a smaller subset of aws cdk. You have no real handrails. Like if you don't know anything about aws cdks, actually kind of an awful place to start because it's just like starting with cloudformation. It's like, I don't know what I'm so.

14:19:00
<transcript>: what

14:19:02
<transcript>: What services do I use.

14:19:04
<transcript>: There's still all of it at your disposal.

14:19:04
<transcript>: ssd nar

14:19:06
<transcript>: Ssd. Narrows your focus.

14:19:06
<transcript>: to like

14:19:10
<transcript>: To like 1% 2% whatever of AWS.

14:19:10
<transcript>: and it's

14:19:14
<transcript>: And it's like, okay, I can get my head around building an API.

14:19:14
<transcript>: and here's

14:19:19
livemahs: i didn't want a macbook pro anyways!!! lol

14:19:23
<transcript>: And here's how I do that. And then you'll learn over time what is actually standing up in your database account. Ssd's. Really great way to start if you're new to AWS.

14:19:31
<transcript>: Let's see I'm lucky together alone? Yeah, no, it's okay. So point over 1% chance? But it's a chance.

14:19:31
blakegreendev: you can mix and match sst and cdk anyway right?

14:19:34
oleksii_lisovyi: I don't want the Macbook anyway. Go Linux, go!

14:19:43
<transcript>: It's a chance. I think we figured out based on how much I stream and how many people watch. It'll be something like giving away an macbook every month. But it could be you. It could be you. I don't want the macbook anyway. Go, linux. Go.

14:19:46
takadimi91: yea i would say even just the "curation" factor for SST alone is worth using it (much less the wonderful DX!)

14:19:50
<transcript>: Yeah, you can mix and match ssns in cdk. You can just do cdk stuff. Let's see, this is the one I want.

14:19:50
<transcript>: you can

14:19:54
<transcript>: You can just do CDC stuff right in your ssd stacks.

14:19:58
<transcript>: So you're not losing that ability.

14:20:02
aisebaxp: Have you gone through the aws certification?

14:20:05
<transcript>: Yeah, just a curation factor for sst alone is worth it. Exactly. And the dx is fantastic.

14:20:05
<transcript>: cli

14:20:08
<transcript>: Cli default region. We're gonna say us each one.

14:20:10
<transcript>: Json format.

14:20:13
<transcript>: What profile name.

14:20:13
<transcript>: what

14:20:14
<transcript>: What.

14:20:14
1camou: what configuration will the MBP have

14:20:17
<transcript>: Statmes. Prod. I thought I said that.

14:20:22
<transcript>: Profile step is probably. So let's do this.

14:20:22
<transcript>: export

14:20:23
<transcript>: Export.

14:20:29
blakegreendev: the lambda reload is so fast I thought it was broke the first time I used it

14:20:31
<transcript>: Export a tox profile equals Statmeus prod. Then we're gonna say, aws, Sts.

14:20:31
<transcript>: get color

14:20:33
<transcript>: Get color identity.

14:20:36
livemahs: Where do you get design inspiration from? I want to build a personal site but having a hard time figuring out how I want it to look smh

14:20:37
<transcript>: Cool. It works. That is the correct account.

14:20:37
<transcript>: feels

14:20:40
<transcript>: Feels good. Let's do AWS.

14:20:42
<transcript>: S, three.

14:20:42
<transcript>: list

14:20:45
<transcript>: List LS.

14:21:05
<transcript>: Wow. That's a lot of buckets. Those are all status buckets. Feels good. What configuration will the macbook have? Great question, camo. I haven't bought this one ahead of time. Usually. So I've done these macbook giveaways and I always buy it ahead of time. And then I can like, show it. Here it is. Somebody's going with it. I have not bought this one, so probably a 14 inch last one. I.

14:21:05
<transcript>: gave away

14:21:07
<transcript>: Gave away was pretty expensive.

14:21:07
<transcript>: we'll probably just give

14:21:10
<transcript>: We'll probably just give away like a 14 inch.

14:21:12
<transcript>: I don't remember the configuration.

14:21:12
<transcript>: it'll probably

14:21:15
<transcript>: It'll probably be like a $2500 laptop.

14:21:17
<transcript>: How's that sound.

14:21:17
<transcript>: a flip

14:21:22
<transcript>: A flip oovoo that follow a flip uvoo.

14:21:25
<transcript>: The lambda, really.

14:21:25
<transcript>: fast i thought

14:21:28
<transcript>: Fast. I thought it was broke the first time. Yeah, it's so good.

14:21:42
<transcript>: Have you gone through the aws certification? I actually have twelve aws certs. I got them all in a six weeks band. Kind of like a parlour trick. I just want to see how fast, because I get all the certs. So I did them all.

14:21:42
<transcript>: over

14:21:44
<transcript>: Over six weeks.

14:21:44
<transcript>: and

14:21:46
<transcript>: And I'm a nerd.

14:21:46
<transcript>: and you shouldn't

14:21:53
<transcript>: And you shouldn't do that. It's not worth it. I didn't get anything for it. I just got to, like, be like, hey, check it out. That was cool.

14:21:53
<transcript>: i got some pets

14:21:56
<transcript>: I got some pets on the back that's basically it.

14:22:05
aisebaxp: Shitttt (the wire voice) 12.......  miduScream

14:22:05
<transcript>: Where do you get the design inspiration from? I want to build a personal site, but having a hard time figuring out how I want it to look.

14:22:05
<transcript>: great

14:22:08
<transcript>: Great question. Live. Moss.

14:22:08
<transcript>: you could

14:22:11
<transcript>: You could do with these days you could do.

14:22:11
<transcript>: like

14:22:20
<transcript>: Like dolly and like midjourney, I bet they would generate some pretty cool inspiration, just like, throw some ideas into it, see what it spits out? Like, I want to make a personal site for developer.

14:22:20
<transcript>: blah blah blah

14:22:23
<transcript>: Blah, blah, blah, blah. Let's do it right now. Actually, I'm so curious.

14:22:25
<transcript>: Dolly.

14:22:30
<transcript>: Do we do, dolly, dolly, I've got there's so many of them there's. Stable diffusion.

14:22:33
<transcript>: We'll try dolly, let's try it.

14:22:42
<transcript>: Give me a mockup for a developers.

14:22:45
<transcript>: I'll say Software developer, a Web developer.

14:22:45
<transcript>: web

14:22:46
<transcript>: Web developers.

14:22:49
<transcript>: Portfolio site.

14:22:51
1camou: Adobe Firefly looks incredible

14:22:53
<transcript>: Clean minimal.

14:22:59
<transcript>: With a bit of flair.

14:22:59
<transcript>: i don't know

14:23:00
<transcript>: I don't know.

14:23:00
<transcript>: making

14:23:02
<transcript>: Making it up.

14:23:05
<transcript>: I'll see what it does.

14:23:05
<transcript>: today

14:23:06
<transcript>: Today.

14:23:08
<transcript>: Generate.

14:23:08
<transcript>: what

14:23:13
<transcript>: What server is overloaded what? Please try again later what.

14:23:16
<transcript>: Well, that's not good.

14:23:19
smilingbig: LUL

14:23:21
livemahs: aw

14:23:28
<transcript>: Let's try something else. Let's try Adobe firefly looks incredible. It does look cool. It'll probably be really good for stuff like this. Right. Let's go to stable, diffuse diffusion. Save the fusion web. Is this it.

14:23:31
<transcript>: Get started for free.

14:23:31
<transcript>: for free

14:23:40
<transcript>: For free. Let's just use the same prompt. I don't know. I felt pretty good about that prompt. Felt like I nailed it the first try. And then dolly was like, Nope.

14:23:49
<transcript>: We're broken. I don't know how these people are affording to run all these gpus constantly. That's awful. These are not good. Okay, so stable. Diffusion online.

14:23:49
<transcript>: what is this

14:23:50
<transcript>: What is this.

14:23:54
<transcript>: Not the best.

14:24:07
jacobdunkin: try midjourney discord

14:24:07
<transcript>: Those are not not the best. I felt like dolly was gonna nail it. And I'm just bummed that the server is overloaded right now. Who has midjurny access? I used to. I don't know if I still do. Don't you have to, like, do it in discord and midjourney.

14:24:10
<transcript>: Do we want to do it midjourney.

14:24:12
<transcript>: Such a tangent.

14:24:15
dofha: midjourney is the best

14:24:17
<transcript>: Get started.

14:24:17
<transcript>: i'm

14:24:19
<transcript>: I'm already having account.

14:24:21
<transcript>: Let's see.

14:24:24
<transcript>: Sign in.

14:24:34
<transcript>: Apparently, I did some stuff with midjourney.

14:24:34
<transcript>: that was

14:24:37
<transcript>: That was like Tom Brady. I was probably trying to do, like, stat, me stuff.

14:24:37
<transcript>: okay

14:24:40
<transcript>: Okay. Let's see. How do I.

14:24:47
<transcript>: Purchase plan. Do I do not have one right now. I probably don't have one to generate jobs and access full guarantee check out our plans.

14:24:48
<transcript>: Yeah, Yeah.

14:24:50
overra_dev: I think dall-e is the lowest quality vs midjourney and running SD on your own machine w/ extensions

14:24:54
<transcript>: We'll do basically plan what's this? 115 hours, fast generations.

14:24:54
<transcript>: what do i get

14:24:57
<transcript>: What do I get? Generally commercial terms.

14:24:57
<transcript>: optional

14:25:00
<transcript>: Optional credit pop up.

14:25:02
<transcript>: Do I just want this one.

14:25:06
jacobdunkin: yeah min

14:25:07
<transcript>: Pro Plan 30 Hours Fast Generations Limited Generations 200 a month.

14:25:12
<transcript>: Try midjourney discord is.

14:25:12
<transcript>: the lowest quality

14:25:18
<transcript>: The lowest quality versus mid journey and running Se on your own machine with extensions. Just do the minimum. Okay, let's do the minimum.

14:25:24
<transcript>: That's awesome. Just docks in myself. Let's just go ahead and fuzzy.

14:25:29
<transcript>: Fuzzy too late, but already did it.

14:25:29
<transcript>: already gave

14:25:32
jacobdunkin: wipe the vod

14:25:36
<transcript>: Already gave you my last four in my thing. That's not cool. Confirming. Okay, close. Thank you.

14:25:37
<transcript>: You okay.

14:25:44
<transcript>: My wife hit my head on some or hit her head on something when she came in here.

14:25:50
<transcript>: Wipe the vod. No, I didn't. Really. I didn't really leak anything, right.

14:25:50
<transcript>: did i

14:25:53
<transcript>: Did I I'm getting a lot of discord messages now.

14:25:56
<transcript>: At least I hear like.

14:25:56
<transcript>: pings okay

14:26:00
<transcript>: Pings. Okay. Did I do it? Okay. I'm good. So now we can go to midjury discord.

14:26:00
<transcript>: how to go to

14:26:02
<transcript>: How to Go To the discord.

14:26:04
jacobdunkin: unfuzzy

14:26:09
<transcript>: This is just a link to it. I feel like there should just be a link to it.

14:26:16
<transcript>: Remember. Support. Oh, I need a fuzzy again. I'm already fuzzy. Okay.

14:26:21
<transcript>: Here we are in the discord. Where do I do it? Newbies.

14:26:21
<transcript>: do

14:26:23
<transcript>: Do I do it in newbies.

14:26:26
<transcript>: Does it assign it's like a sign to change, doesn't it.

14:26:30
<transcript>: I think it just gives you one, right.

14:26:33
<transcript>: Thank you for that. Followup.

14:26:35
<transcript>: Lance, pillow.

14:26:40
<transcript>: Unfoldy. I don't want to unfuzzy just yet because we've got a lot of stuff pulled up.

14:26:40
<transcript>: i guess

14:26:44
<transcript>: I guess I will. How do I? How do I do it.

14:26:44
<transcript>: it's

14:26:51
<transcript>: It's been so long I did it early on. I don't even know where I can do it. Where can I do it? Kind of do it in any one of these.

14:26:54
<transcript>: Let's just pull up General ten.

14:26:54
<transcript>: let's just

14:26:54
jacobdunkin: any of the generals

14:26:57
<transcript>: Let's just jump down to the bottom. Let's give it a go.

14:27:05
smilingbig: just noticed the trackpad, very cool

14:27:05
<transcript>: I have to do something, though. No, I have to like, what do I have to do at.

14:27:05
<transcript>: c

14:27:06
<transcript>: C.

14:27:10
<transcript>: I have to, like, read it getting started or something.

14:27:14
<transcript>: The journey Somebody tell me.

14:27:16
<transcript>: Any of the generals. Okay.

14:27:16
<transcript>: quick

14:27:18
cchambers75: is like /imagine or something

14:27:20
dofha: -> /prompt

14:27:20
<transcript>: Quick start guide. Here we go. I forget there's like a bot or something, right.

14:27:27
<transcript>: Selecting newbies Imagine Imagine all the people.

14:27:30
<transcript>: Living in.

14:27:35
<transcript>: Just notice the trackpad.

14:27:35
<transcript>: propped

14:27:38
dofha: oy yes my bad /imagine

14:27:39
<transcript>: Propped. Okay. Cool. Imagine we're gonna it's gonna work. We're just waiting on it.

14:27:49
<transcript>: Give me a markup for Woodville or sport loyalty. Clean, minimal. With a bit of flare. Is it coming? It's coming.

14:27:53
<transcript>: Here it comes. Okay. We're gonna actually do some more.

14:28:00
<transcript>: My wife brought me some delicious looking oatmeal, wow, look at all the blueberries in that oatmeal.

14:28:00
overra_dev: you can DM the bot

14:28:04
<transcript>: This is gonna be a bad portfolio side, isn't it.

14:28:04
<transcript>: it's gonna

14:28:05
<transcript>: It's gonna be pretty bad.

14:28:18
system1100: it'll be a generic headshot as it seems

14:28:19
<transcript>: Yes, my bad. Oh, you're good. You're good. Duffa. Where is it? Is it done.

14:28:19
overra_dev: or even invite it to your server

14:28:23
<transcript>: Okay. Here we are.

14:28:26
<transcript>: I mean.

14:28:29
<transcript>: It's inspiration of some sort.

14:28:32
<transcript>: It's interesting that it generated.

14:28:34
system1100: 2000 vibes

14:28:38
<transcript>: Like what looks like midjairney people too.

14:28:43
<transcript>: So there we go? That's what I would do? 2000 vibes.

14:28:43
<transcript>: yeah

14:28:44
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:28:48
<transcript>: It's something I don't know about software development, but.

14:28:51
<transcript>: That's what I would do. I would start there.

14:28:51
<transcript>: and then

14:28:53
<transcript>: And then there's other stuff like.

14:28:58
<transcript>: What is there? There's, like.

14:29:12
<transcript>: Dribble. Is that a thing? Just dribble. Still a thing. You could look at dribble for design inspiration. Oh, there's a tailwind. Just do the tailwind. Tailwind templates.

14:29:17
system1100: add dribbble shot in the prompt

14:29:19
overra_dev: https://layers.to/

14:29:20
<transcript>: Just bypass you. I. They have like a yeah, personal website template. This one looks great.

14:29:20
<transcript>: i

14:29:22
<transcript>: I don't see this near enough for how good it is.

14:29:25
<transcript>: That's a great looking personal site.

14:29:31
<transcript>: And nobody seems to use it. I thought like everyone's personal site would start looking like this, but I don't see it.

14:29:31
<transcript>: does anyone see this

14:29:33
<transcript>: Does Anyone see this? Ever.

14:29:34
overra_dev: @adamdotdev  overra.com lol

14:29:37
<transcript>: I feel like I might make my personal site look like this.

14:29:41
<transcript>: And like look great articles. Like.

14:29:44
<transcript>: This is a nice looking portfolio.

14:29:45
<transcript>: Over.

14:29:45
<transcript>: do you use

14:29:48
cchambers75: bing released their own image generator I believe (its probably dalle though)

14:29:49
<transcript>: Do you use it? Oh, my goodness, to use it.

14:29:50
livemahs: oooh that is nice

14:29:51
<transcript>: Just as I said, Nobody uses it.

14:29:51
<transcript>: over

14:29:55
<transcript>: Over. I'm gonna pull it up on the other monitor. Copy link.

14:30:02
<transcript>: There you go. O'very uses it. It's a goodlooking template, you know, I just. I like it.

14:30:04
<transcript>: I like it.

14:30:06
<transcript>: I think it's a winner.

14:30:06
<transcript>: and i

14:30:08
aisebaxp: Use the Astro templates.... there are a few nice ones

14:30:08
overra_dev: i pulled out a lot because I don't have a lot to show

14:30:08
<transcript>: And I want to see it more.

14:30:08
<transcript>: i'll see more

14:30:14
<transcript>: I'll see more people use it. It's called all this. Let's get back to actual work. What do we say.

14:30:14
<transcript>: actual

14:30:23
<transcript>: Actual work sound good. I'm big of that. I'm good with that. We still got to make this page. And to do that, I just have to connect to the database. To do that, I just have to do it like a hundred different things.

14:30:28
<transcript>: Okay. So we now have our.

14:30:28
<transcript>: let's see

14:30:29
<transcript>: Let's see.

14:30:33
<transcript>: This is now configured.

14:30:33
<transcript>: so

14:30:39
<transcript>: So we can actually connect to our stat muse production. This is just going to be.

14:30:44
<transcript>: Appmews prod all of them are gonna be.

14:30:48
<transcript>: That one too.

14:30:50
<transcript>: No.

14:30:50
<transcript>: nope

14:30:52
<transcript>: Nope.

14:30:55
system1100: I'm completely migrating to Solid.js and I'm going to spread the word PEOPLE USE IT AND STOP USING REACT :DDDD let the programming gods be with you

14:30:57
<transcript>: Staging production default.

14:31:01
<transcript>: App news.

14:31:01
<transcript>: us eas

14:31:05
<transcript>: US east. One. That all looks fine. Okay.

14:31:10
overra_dev: oh I forgot that layers site is in beta, it's kinda like a dribbble

14:31:11
cowfacedev: Adam be like....`Sorry, i dropped  db in prod`

14:31:13
<transcript>: I use the astro templates. There are a few nice ones. Oh, are there astro templates that's cool layers to dribble shot in the prompt.

14:31:13
<transcript>: oh add dribble

14:31:15
<transcript>: Oh, add dribble shot in the prompt. That's a good call.

14:31:15
<transcript>: that would probably

14:31:18
<transcript>: That would probably help with the mid journey.

14:31:24
<transcript>: You can invite the bot to your servant. That's cool.

14:31:31
<transcript>: Lots of good suggestions in the chat.

14:31:40
system1100: nice healthy meal

14:31:44
<transcript>: Follow.

14:31:52
<transcript>: Faces, you face is here.

14:31:54
securibee: also, just start saving websites you like for general reference

14:31:56
<transcript>: And be like, Sorry, I dropped db and prod oh, Geez.

14:31:56
<transcript>: yeah we'll

14:31:59
<transcript>: Yeah we'll see we're gonna hope I don't.

14:32:03
<transcript>: Let's hope I don't drop the db. That'd be bad.

14:32:03
<transcript>: so

14:32:06
<transcript>: So now let's see. We can go to our stack.

14:32:11
<transcript>: And we should be able to let's see what's wrong in here.

14:32:11
<transcript>: this stuff

14:32:13
<transcript>: This stuff is wrong.

14:32:17
<transcript>: Just stack.

14:32:17
<transcript>: this is

14:32:20
securibee: while browsing*

14:32:21
<transcript>: This is not from clustering anymore. It's from instant.

14:32:21
<transcript>: and this

14:32:23
<transcript>: And this is going to be instance.

14:32:26
<transcript>: What we're trying to do is we're trying to.

14:32:29
<transcript>: Okay. So we don't actually have a postgres secret for the secret.

14:32:34
<transcript>: Oh, this is gonna be so annoying. I just remembered how statmese does this.

14:32:34
<transcript>: oh no

14:32:35
<transcript>: Oh no.

14:32:38
<transcript>: This is gonna be so annoying.

14:32:43
<transcript>: I think we have like a key.

14:32:48
<transcript>: I think we have a kms key Oh.

14:32:48
<transcript>: there are no

14:32:51
<transcript>: There are no secrets in stat. Muse.

14:32:51
<transcript>: only a

14:32:53
<transcript>: Only a kms key.

14:33:00
<transcript>: Oh no.

14:33:09
<transcript>: Can I add multiple ways off to an rds database? Can I do that.

14:33:12
<transcript>: Can I add like an alternate off method.

14:33:14
<transcript>: That would be great.

14:33:17
<transcript>: Actually.

14:33:30
<transcript>: So.

14:33:33
<transcript>: Rds.

14:33:41
<transcript>: Authentication options.

14:33:44
system1100: where did you get all of the stamuse stats?

14:33:48
<transcript>: Okay. So that's where RDS proxy.

14:33:54
<transcript>: Second is I am authentication. I would like to do that.

14:33:59
<transcript>: I'd like to do that.

14:34:09
<transcript>: Also just start saving websites you like for general reference. That's a good idea while browsing.

14:34:19
<transcript>: Where did you get all the semi stats? We had a statistician that we hired for, like, five years. Who built our stats database? He's the creator of Basketball Reference. Justin kabatco.

14:34:27
<transcript>: So this is going to be a headache. Actually connecting to this database is going to be a headache.

14:34:30
<transcript>: So mother stage.

14:34:30
<transcript>: this is the

14:34:32
<transcript>: This is the one.

14:34:37
stroopwafel26: Hello!

14:34:41
<transcript>: I guess I can look at how Mother does it. Let's go to Mothra.

14:34:46
<transcript>: I guess I might have to do this in here.

14:34:47
system1100: pretty pricy investment :DD

14:34:52
<transcript>: Let's see RDS.

14:34:53
dofha: what is statmuse actual stack ?

14:35:05
<transcript>: How does it connect to the database.

14:35:09
<transcript>: Postgres I'm just trying to find.

14:35:36
<transcript>: Pretty pricey investment Yeah.

14:35:36
<transcript>: stammy

14:35:41
<transcript>: Stammy. Is we've raised like $15 million, so we've had the money to spend.

14:35:41
<transcript>: to have

14:35:44
<transcript>: To have a proper Stats Database database.

14:35:44
<transcript>: min

14:35:54
<transcript>: Minipic. Thank you for that. Follow me. I don't know how to say that. Without adding some valve, I have added my own valve. Maybe it's manny Pick. Maybe it's bonnie Pick. But I went with Benny.

14:35:54
<transcript>: just seemed

14:35:59
<transcript>: Just seemed the most natural Binny pick. Thanks for that follow. I really do appreciate it.

14:35:59
<transcript>: appreciate all your

14:36:02
<transcript>: Appreciate all your follows. Every single one of them.

14:36:08
<transcript>: Moth Import moth repo. Let's see.

14:36:08
<transcript>: postgres

14:36:09
<transcript>: Postgres.

14:36:11
<transcript>: Inbound.

14:36:23
<transcript>: Try to figure out how it currently.

14:36:32
<transcript>: What is Statmeus actual stack? So the current statmes.com is an elixir Phoenix app, but also react. It's like a Liquor Phoenix.

14:36:32
<transcript>: with some react

14:36:34
<transcript>: With some react thrown in there.

14:36:34
<transcript>: that's why i

14:36:38
<transcript>: That's why I was being rewritten. Honestly, it's just kind of like a lot of things.

14:36:46
<transcript>: There's something.

14:36:50
<transcript>: In terms of how the postgres connection works.

14:36:53
<transcript>: Let's see. Moth import.

14:36:59
<transcript>: How does it work.

14:37:06
<transcript>: So I have to have network access. So we're gonna add that to the security group.

14:37:06
system1100: 15mill is a BIG funding, what is even statmuse's business model?

14:37:13
<transcript>: But then once I do, I have to know the password and the password the way we do it, it's like I think it's just a key.

14:37:16
<transcript>: That encrypts.

14:37:16
<transcript>: maybe

14:37:19
<transcript>: Maybe like an environment file or something.

14:37:21
<transcript>: Look.

14:37:21
<transcript>: and i

14:37:24
<transcript>: And I want to know if I can just add another.

14:37:29
<transcript>: Actions. Can I just set up like I am authentication.

14:37:31
<transcript>: Because that would be so cool.

14:37:31
<transcript>: well let's

14:37:33
<transcript>: Well, let's see if the rds proxy lets me do that.

14:37:36
<transcript>: So we're gonna add a proxy.

14:37:36
<transcript>: what we're doing

14:37:38
<transcript>: What we're doing here.

14:37:44
<transcript>: First things first we get we described the database here, and I'm logged.

14:37:51
<transcript>: Secret proxy. Let's just comment out all of this.

14:37:56
<transcript>: All of this gets commented out.

14:38:03
<transcript>: Actually all of it the api's sake right now the site is real, but I'm just gonna go ahead and comment it out.

14:38:07
<transcript>: I just want to get started here on a blank slate.

14:38:09
<transcript>: By checking.

14:38:09
<transcript>: i want

14:38:11
<transcript>: I want to see.

14:38:14
<transcript>: Kind of hit.

14:38:14
<transcript>: the db

14:38:18
<transcript>: The db instances and log some details. Let's just see if I can do that.

14:38:21
aisebaxp: Astro-auth? Or it doesn't serve your purpose

14:38:24
<transcript>: Do I need to do sso first profiles configured with Invalid sso credentials.

14:38:28
<transcript>: Okay. So let's do.

14:38:30
<transcript>: Echo.

14:38:33
<transcript>: Echo a tobs profile.

14:38:37
<transcript>: That means prod. Okay.

14:38:41
<transcript>: Aws, sso, login.

14:38:42
system1100: is SST a backend framework or like a deployment tool?

14:38:48
<transcript>: Status prod.

14:38:48
<transcript>: thanks for

14:38:51
<transcript>: Thanks for the ball. Whispering Ravens.

14:38:56
<transcript>: It's like a deployment tool.

14:38:56
stroopwafel26: hey you changed the overhead camera shot a bit?

14:39:03
ezteq: What is the thing laying in front of your monitor?

14:39:03
<transcript>: Its infrastructure is code, but it goes beyond that. So it's kind of hard to put ssd in a box.

14:39:03
<transcript>: these days

14:39:05
<transcript>: These days.

14:39:05
<transcript>: it's a lot of things

14:39:06
<transcript>: It's a lot of things.

14:39:14
<transcript>: Astro auth we're I'm gonna be using sst off profiles configured with Invalid credentials.

14:39:19
<transcript>: Pride parameters.

14:39:26
<transcript>: What is the problem here.

14:39:29
<transcript>: We have.

14:39:32
<transcript>: This configured correctly.

14:39:36
<transcript>: Let's go back to our.

14:39:41
blakegreendev: I think you need to pass in the profile into sst config?

14:39:43
<transcript>: Here. Ssd. Config. Maybe.

14:39:46
<transcript>: There's something wrong in here, stat. Muse. Let's see.

14:39:49
<transcript>: Calm.

14:39:49
<transcript>: prof

14:39:52
<transcript>: Profile is input stage.

14:39:56
<transcript>: Oh, did I not define a stone? I need to do a stage.

14:40:02
<transcript>: Pass in the profile into sst. Config. I think I'm doing that right here.

14:40:02
<transcript>: like

14:40:05
<transcript>: Like we're getting the profile from.

14:40:05
<transcript>: i

14:40:09
<transcript>: I could just forget all that and look up stuff.

14:40:14
<transcript>: That means broad. Just in case there's something wrong there.

14:40:20
<transcript>: So what's? So what's that look like? That's the name of the stack.

14:40:25
<transcript>: It's always the same profile. There's just one account.

14:40:25
<transcript>: let's

14:40:27
<transcript>: Let's try that.

14:40:37
<transcript>: Configured with Invalid ssl credentials.

14:40:43
<transcript>: What is the thing laying in front of your monitor.

14:40:48
<transcript>: Laying in front of my monitor.

14:40:53
<transcript>: Oh, maybe a stream deck. Maybe you saw the stream deck.

14:40:53
zxshan: Hey Adam! Hey chat :D

14:40:58
ezteq: The is like a silver bar on the table?

14:41:02
<transcript>: Change the overhead camera shot a bit. I did stroop. I'm always mixing it up around here. I wear a white shirt today. Hey, zeck Shan.

14:41:09
<transcript>: Like I silver bar on the table. A silver bar? Oh, it might be my Mac studio.

14:41:11
stroopwafel26: i really like the new shot

14:41:11
<transcript>: That you saw.

14:41:12

14:42:01
<transcript>: ready to get

14:42:04
<transcript>: Ready to get out and not be outside, you know.

14:42:04
<transcript>: it'd be anywhere

14:42:05
<transcript>: It'd be anywhere else.

14:42:09
livemahs: I have 2 more tries, but today is not my day

14:42:10
<transcript>: You got more chances live, Ma, you can do it twice every stream.

14:42:15
<transcript>: Two more tries. But today is not my day.

14:42:15
<transcript>: well it was

14:42:19
<transcript>: Well, it was no one else's day either. So at least there's that.

14:42:22
<transcript>: What is the problem.

14:42:22
<transcript>: what's the problem

14:42:23
<transcript>: What's the problem? What's the problem.

14:42:26
<transcript>: If I do it again, it'll work this time.

14:42:27
zol0: omg I won PogChamp

14:42:29
<transcript>: And he doesn't relate with that.

14:42:31
stroopwafel26: spoiler: no one gets a macbook pro

14:42:33
<transcript>: Oh, my God, you won. No, I don't think you did.

14:42:38
<transcript>: But no one gets a magic pro it honestly, someone will win it eventually.

14:42:46
<transcript>: It's a small chance, but it is a chance and I'd set this up to not give on away. My plan is to give one away, just gonna make you earn it, you know.

14:42:49
ezteq: How big is the percentage?

14:42:51
<transcript>: All right. Blake. What do you think? What's wrong here.

14:42:52
leov1280: Hello there, may I ask what is your zsh theme and font pls

14:42:55
stroopwafel26: i have 34 chances tbh

14:42:55
<transcript>: What's wrong with this? Do I need to do, like, ssd and knit or something.

14:42:56
zol0: is this a different macbook pro than the rebase macbook pro?

14:42:59
<transcript>: Leo.

14:42:59
<transcript>: welcome to

14:43:01
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Leoff.

14:43:01
<transcript>: may i ask

14:43:06
securibee: does your profile have the required params?

14:43:09
<transcript>: May I ask, what is your zsh theme? It's dracula. The color scheme is dracula. I use Power level 100 or whatever it is.

14:43:12
<transcript>: Otterlord thank you for the follow.

14:43:18
<transcript>: Does your profile has a required params? That's a great question, because it keeps saying it doesn't.

14:43:18
<transcript>: maybe

14:43:18
<transcript>: Maybe.

14:43:18
<transcript>: it doesn't

14:43:22
livemahs: Do you get anything for people redeeming channel points?

14:43:23
<transcript>: It doesn't. Maybe I should listen to what it's telling me.

14:43:29
<transcript>: It configured with inbound ssl credentials required parameters. Sso account ID SSO region.

14:43:30
<transcript>: Oh.

14:43:36
<transcript>: Parameters. No, I have that. I don't have role name. Let's see.

14:43:36
<transcript>: got

14:43:42
stroopwafel26: oh gotta go, important meeting about a potential new job

14:43:43
<transcript>: Got SSO session, SSO account ID SSO role name region output. Okay. So we're missing some things.

14:43:46
<transcript>: Egg powers things Doors that follow.

14:43:51
zxshan: GL @stroopwafel26

14:44:06
<transcript>: So Power Level 10,000. It's my dot file. So check out my dot files. There's a command for it. Is this a different magma Pro than the Rebase aqua Pro? Yes, this is a different one. The Rebase one still has not been discovered. There's a golden ticket out there waiting for somebody. Check it out. Rebase TV another way you can win a macbook. Does your profile have the required plans? Do you get anything.

14:44:06
<transcript>: for people

14:44:09
neochromer: damn

14:44:11
<transcript>: For people. Redeeming channel points. I do not live, maz. I get nothing.

14:44:40
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Crying, too's. Any tips for anyone willing to start streaming coding on twitch? You know what? I have a lot of tips and I'm gonna come right over here to tell you those tips, because this is a topic that's very near and dear to me right now.

14:44:44
neochromer: Would be nice to upgrade my macbook air

14:44:44
<transcript>: And I want to give it proper attention.

14:44:54
<transcript>: So first calf is. Should I Rick, roll you or go for the macbook pro? I believe I deleted Ricroll. Did I delete it? Is it still there? It doesn't work. So you can't rip. Roll me. Don't waste the point.

14:44:54
<transcript>: would be nice

14:45:12
<transcript>: Would be nice to upgrade my macbook Air. Yeah, yeah, no, it's somebody's gonna win one and it's gonna be so exciting when they do because it's a tiny little chance? It's a 1% chance every time someone redeems? There's a tiny little chance they're gonna win? And it's exciting. I'm on the edge of my seat. Honestly, when you guys all are hitting the button.

14:45:12
<transcript>: like who's gonna

14:45:17
<transcript>: Like who's gonna win? Okay, so tips getting started streaming coding on Twitch.

14:45:17
<transcript>: i

14:45:19
<transcript>: I have so many thoughts.

14:45:19
<transcript>: but

14:45:29
<transcript>: But first, I'm gonna turn my music down because I don't think I want to have music going while I'm giving you these tips. So here's the thing. We started watching Dev.

14:45:31
adamdotdev: !discord

14:45:31
fossabot: Adam is a member of the watch.dev Discord server and he'd love to see you there: https://discord.gg/watchdotdev

14:45:50
<transcript>: Discord. Just gonna plug it here. Watch dev, me and dax. It's a discord server, specifically for devs who stream or Devs who enjoy watching dev stream. So it's meant to be like a shared community. What me and back both stream. We stream back to back. And a lot of our communities overlap. Like.

14:45:50
<transcript>: a lot of the people

14:46:02
<transcript>: A lot of the people who hang out with me here on Twitter also hang out with dax. And it felt weird having all these separate discord servers. So dax and I wanted to have kind of a joint discord server. And then we want to open up to other deadstreamers. So we've added a handful.

14:46:02
<transcript>: there's seven streams

14:46:17
<transcript>: There's seven streams in there. Now it's like tawni and acorn and CM Griffing and melties in there and allen's in there, and I'm gonna forget somebody, and I shouldn't have started listing them, but anyway, we've got, like this idea that we can kind of share.

14:46:17
<transcript>: and celebrate the

14:46:18
vapor__dev: I'm in there!!!

14:46:23
<transcript>: And celebrate the idea of streaming programming on twitch. It doesn't have to have to be twitch. It could be YouTube. But.

14:46:27
<transcript>: Alan's in there. Andre. Thank you so much for.

14:46:33
<transcript>: Here's my tips because this is something I'm very passionate about. I might even start creating content. Watch out.

14:46:33
<transcript>: and i

14:46:38
<transcript>: And I create content about streaming programming, which.

14:46:42
vapor__dev: CONTENT ALARM WEE WOO

14:46:48
<transcript>: I don't like saying create content. Just something about that. Feel so dirty. I don't know. It feels much more sophisticated to say. I'm thinking about becoming a creator in this space.

14:46:48
<transcript>: i don't know

14:46:58
m2devdotnet: Would subscribe

14:47:01
<transcript>: I don't know. Content alarm. Yeah, I don't like the word content. I know something about it. It seems so generic and blamed. And like, who wants content? Like, we all consume content all day, but nobody wants it. If somebody's like, hey, would you like some more content? No, it sounds awful.

14:47:01
<transcript>: would subscribe

14:47:06
<transcript>: Would subscribe. Okay, good to know. So I've started a YouTube channel.

14:47:06
<transcript>: and i

14:47:11
<transcript>: And I've realized about myself I don't really want to create content around programming. I just don't.

14:47:11
<transcript>: something about

14:47:13
tnkhanh: lol]

14:47:14
crintusza: I didn't expect a focused talk about this, but thank you haha

14:47:23
tnkhanh: no content!

14:47:26
<transcript>: Something about programming. It's been my job for a long time. I'm very passionate about it. I love it, but like teaching people how to program. It just doesn't feel like my thing. I don't think I know enough, or I don't think I pay attention enough. Like it's just a thing I do, and I really enjoy doing it.

14:47:26
<transcript>: but

14:47:35
<transcript>: But I don't feel like it's my place to try and tell other people how to do it. Like I just I'm not a deep thinker. I don't have a lot of insights.

14:47:35
<transcript>: and like most

14:47:51
zol0: rip statmuse

14:47:54
<transcript>: And like most everything I do, I just treated his throwaway. I just assume all the code I'm riding is gonna, like, not be working in two years. Nobody's gonna be using it. It's gonna die. And who cares? So it kind of feels like I'm not the best person to be creating stuff about that. I do want to create stuff. And I don't know what. So now I'm starting to think maybe I should create content about streaming on twitch because I love it.

14:47:54
<transcript>: it's inject

14:48:12
<transcript>: It's injected all kinds of new life into my career. I have worked from home my entire career, so that's a long time to be sitting in an office alone and doing this stuff on twitch has been such a breath of fresh air. I just started doing the last year and having you all here hanging out with me while I'm working coworkering, if you will.

14:48:12
<transcript>: so much fun

14:48:14
<transcript>: So much fun.

14:48:14
<transcript>: so i'm very

14:48:33
2r1ngs: I really support this. And hopefully one day I will be a streamer create some stuff inspiring people.

14:48:34
<transcript>: So I'm very passionate about that. I do want other devs to experience that. I don't think it's for everybody. So I don't think every developer would enjoy this. I think it's probably some subset, but I think it's a subset that's bigger than the subset that does it. If that makes sense. I think there's people out there that would really enjoy it and they'll never try it. And so I want to reach those people. So that's kind of the watch.

14:48:34
<transcript>: dev thing

14:48:38
<transcript>: Dev thing. So here's my actual tips. I said, all of that.

14:48:38
<transcript>: to

14:48:42
<transcript>: To actually give you a little peek into my tips.

14:49:02
<transcript>: So one, you need to try. You need to try it. Everyone needs to try. I think every developer should try streaming program on twitch. Two. You need to expect that you might hate it. I don't know. I didn't have this experience. I tried, and I loved it, but I know other people do it for a long time, and they just feel like they're never really enjoying it. And they're just trying to build up something.

14:49:02
<transcript>: it really

14:49:08
<transcript>: It really just kind of click for me immediately. I think three or four streams in. I was like, yeah, I want to do this forever. It's the best.

14:49:22
<transcript>: If you don't have that feeling, maybe you still could develop it. But just go into it with this expectation that you're just going to explore it and you're gonna see, is it for you? Because I think part of it is you have to have a personality that is like.

14:49:22
<transcript>: enjoys

14:49:24
<transcript>: Enjoys.

14:49:24
<transcript>: the const

14:49:38
<transcript>: The constant interruption and the interaction and the like, whatever you got to get something from it, or it's just gonna slow you down and you're gonna get frustrated and you're not gonna get much done with your work, and you're gonna feel like whatever it's gonna be a thing you resent. Maybe. I don't know.

14:49:52
<transcript>: It did click for me, and it was just immediately, like I knew I enjoyed this. One thing that you can do is just only stream a short chunk of your day. Don't go in guns ablaze and stream your entire work day. I did that early on.

14:49:52
<transcript>: as much

14:49:56
<transcript>: As much as I loved it. I loved streaming. I loved the interaction.

14:49:56
<transcript>: it started

14:49:59
aisebaxp: Have you tried the coworkers twitch thing..? Just sit down and do your stuff while others judge 🤣

14:50:10
aisebaxp: Coworking

14:50:16
<transcript>: It started to be the thing that I started resent. I took a huge break because I felt like I'm really not getting as much done, and I need to get more done. So I should probably just stop streaming. And that's a bad way to do it. That was like an all or nothing. Just do what I'm doing this time is a small chunk. Like I do a small chunk of my day. I stream 4 hours. I work for another four or 5 hours, so I've kind of got.

14:50:16
<transcript>: like

14:50:23
<transcript>: Like time to get stuff done offstream because you will be less productive. Inherently. Like, if you're streaming, you're gonna be interacting. You're gonna be doing stuff.

14:50:23
<transcript>: that is not

14:50:38
<transcript>: That is not your normal work, but that's a feature. And that's I guess the point is like, yeah, coworking, it's like that is an enjoyable part of it. And you gotta embrace that part of it and treat it as that like, this is part of the social aspects of my life. Now.

14:50:38
<transcript>: this is how i get

14:50:40
<transcript>: This is how I get interaction with other people.

14:50:46
<transcript>: So I don't care you're never gonna interrupt me you're never gonna like don't feel bad.

14:50:46
<transcript>: that you

14:50:54
<transcript>: That you ask me a question, and I went off on a tangent and talk for 20 minutes instead of working. That's why I'm here. I wouldn't do this if I wasn't. If that wasn't why I was here.

14:51:02
<transcript>: No, it name no, its name. Thanks for the follow. Also Andre, I don't know if I saw your follow, but thank you for the follow.

14:51:05
<transcript>: So tips, I would say.

14:51:10
<transcript>: Specifically with the when it comes to streaming programming.

14:51:10
<transcript>: you need

14:51:20
<transcript>: You need to also not be really like precious about your code because I do get this question a lot like how is it how do you get over the fear of programming in front of other people.

14:51:20
<transcript>: this

14:51:32
<transcript>: This has never been a problem for me, and I think it's because I just assume all my code is garbage, just like assume everything you're doing is probably less than ideal. And everybody is like we're all programming.

14:51:32
<transcript>: stuff

14:51:35
<transcript>: Stuff every day, and we're doing it in less than ideal ways.

14:51:35
<transcript>: and

14:51:45
<transcript>: And ways that you can help with that or pair programming and twitch is the best pair programming on the planet Earth, because you got like a hundred people potentially watching and telling you everything you could do better.

14:51:45
<transcript>: and if you

14:51:47
thdxr: I'm back - David said he's mad at you but wouldn't explain why

14:51:51
<transcript>: And if you embrace that part of it and just don't be too precious about, like what you're doing and like it's good the first time you do it.

14:51:51
<transcript>: if

14:51:56
thdxr: oh adam is going on a rant

14:52:06
<transcript>: If you can just, like, accept that the first thing you're gonna ride is gonna be bad anyway. And you already knew that about yourself. Then there's nothing anybody's gonna say that's gonna offend you. And you're not nervous about people seeing it because who cares? It's always gonna be bad. What do they say? It takes three implementations of something to get it right. I don't know.

14:52:06
<transcript>: i've heard that before

14:52:08
<transcript>: I've heard that before.

14:52:08
<transcript>: i just

14:52:11
<transcript>: I just don't like put too much weight into.

14:52:12
vapor__dev: @thdxr LUL

14:52:13
crintusza: I'm not wanting to stream my work day, but side projects. I'm learning Flutter and how to build apps. So will definitely assume my code is garbage

14:52:19
<transcript>: Your code or thinking your code is good and then you can drop the whole expectation that like it's good. Trash Dev.

14:52:19
<transcript>: trash

14:52:26
tnkhanh: chat, we are just here to pair programming

14:52:39
<transcript>: Trash dev literally made his name Trash dev. For this exact reason, he didn't want people coming in and having high expectations because he works at Netflix. Like, You're Super smart, and then being like, Wait, what did you just do with code? That's awful. So he set the expectation low. He said, My name is Trash dev. Everything I do is trash. And now you come in. And like, when he does something smart with typescript, you'll like, ha.

14:52:39
<transcript>: he's not

14:52:46
<transcript>: He's not so trash after all. So set the expectation, just like be okay with being bad at coding. We all are. It's fine.

14:52:46
<transcript>: flocks think so

14:52:48
<transcript>: Flocks think so much should follow.

14:52:48
<transcript>: so if you can get

14:52:51
<transcript>: So if you can get over that hurdle and you can decide.

14:52:51
<transcript>: i'm not

14:53:09
<transcript>: I'm not gonna care. I'm not gonna get any selfworth out of people think I'm good at this, and I'm just gonna do it to get to hang out with people and enjoy their company while I work. Then at least your psychologies in the right place. That doesn't mean you're gonna immediately get traction and people are gonna follow you and they're gonna love your stuff. They're gonna come hang out every day. Doesn't mean that.

14:53:09
<transcript>: but

14:53:11
<transcript>: But it does mean at least.

14:53:11
<transcript>: you're gonna be okay

14:53:12
<transcript>: You're gonna be okay.

14:53:12
<transcript>: and you're gonna

14:53:19
<transcript>: And you're gonna enjoy the process figuring out if it's for you or if it's not. I do think I just tweeted the other day.

14:53:33
<transcript>: Kind of controversial. I. Tweeted. That if you've been doing, like putting out a lot of content for a long time and you're not getting attraction, it's possible it's possible that your personality is bad. And what I meant by that is.

14:53:33
<transcript>: it's possible

14:53:45
greetten: ive always wondered what its like to stream to 0 people LUL

14:53:53
<transcript>: It's possible that your personality is not one that draws others. And I think everybody would have a community that would eventually form around them. Like, there are people that will resonate with your personality, whatever your personality is. I think some of people's personalities are naturally going to pull people in a little more. And if you feel like you've been streaming for a really long time, it's just taking.

14:53:53
<transcript>: streaming

14:53:58
crintusza: That's my biggest fear with starting

14:53:58
<transcript>: Streaming as an example, if you've been streaming for a very long time and no one's showing up.

14:53:58
<transcript>: then

14:54:00
<transcript>: Then it's probably.

14:54:10
greetten: true

14:54:11
<transcript>: It's probably not for you. I would just say, like, don't don't do it if you're not getting if your goal is to like, actually have people to hang out with and no one's coming to hang out.

14:54:11
<transcript>: then

14:54:15
charafmrah: Hi there! what about getting your first few viewers? do you think Twitter or Discord are good avenues for that

14:54:15
<transcript>: Then you need to, like, take a look in the mirror and say, like, is this for me.

14:54:15
<transcript>: why

14:54:19
<transcript>: Why would say too? It's possible you just don't have something to hook them in.

14:54:19
<transcript>: it's possible

14:54:23
<transcript>: It's possible. Like I already had a Twitter following. So I was just saying.

14:54:23
<transcript>: my twitter

14:54:32
<transcript>: My Twitter be like, come watch me, please, please, come watch me if you don't have that and you're starting with no online presence, twitch would probably be a really bad place to start.

14:54:36
thdxr: I got started by spamming adam's following

14:54:38
<transcript>: I would work on building up a following an audience or whatever you want to call it. I hate the word audience.

14:54:38
<transcript>: like i

14:54:40
<transcript>: Like I have an audience.

14:54:40
<transcript>: you all

14:54:42
tnkhanh: LUL

14:54:42
<transcript>: You all like to watch me.

14:54:42
<transcript>: you're my audience

14:54:51
<transcript>: You're my audience. Now that's so dumb. But community feels just as cringy, like my community. My community is so welcoming. I don't know. Just something about that.

14:54:51
<transcript>: yeah

14:54:53
greetten: fans*

14:54:54
vapor__dev: adam random question .. in your "why" you mention video courses..did you ever film any?

14:54:59
dnbull: spot on. most that complain that they get no viewers have the driest personalities

14:54:59
<transcript>: Yeah. So if you don't have, like a hook, something that there's a reason for people to watch you all of social media. The whole internet is really just.

14:54:59
<transcript>: being

14:55:00
<transcript>: Being.

14:55:00
<transcript>: exceptional

14:55:03
aisebaxp: vamoaJajant

14:55:04
charafmrah: ok you just answered me lol

14:55:06
<transcript>: Exceptional or extraordinary or different. Like the only way people get attention is by being.

14:55:17
<transcript>: Different. Right? Like, you have to have a hook. You have to have something that draws people in and then your personality and just sort of like.

14:55:17
<transcript>: how people

14:55:18
<transcript>: How people.

14:55:18
<transcript>: perceive

14:55:20
tobs_on_twitch: you need to be attention worthy

14:55:20
vapor__dev: i got bullied into it by thdxr and it's making me so happy cause i was so bored before

14:55:21
<transcript>: Perceive you and whether you're kind of like their style.

14:55:21
<transcript>: will determine

14:55:33
<transcript>: Will determine whether they stick around. Does that make sense? I don't know. I just realized that red chat for like a long time and I said a lot of words. Split software. Things are to follow Walter riveras and Flip Tail. Thank you for the follows.

14:55:33
<transcript>: oh adam's

14:55:38
<transcript>: Oh, adam's going on a rant. Yeah, I guess I'm going on a rant when I don't read chat.

14:55:38
<transcript>: let's see

14:55:46
<transcript>: Let's see. I didn't expect to focus. Talk about this, but thank you. You're welcome, Chris. Just like, hey, any tips for getting started streaming? And I'm like, let me tell you.

14:55:46
<transcript>: have i got some

14:55:48
<transcript>: Have I got some tips.

14:55:48
<transcript>: this

14:55:50
<transcript>: This just been very on my mind lately.

14:55:50
<transcript>: like just trying to figure

14:55:53
securibee: adam: hold my beer

14:55:54
aisebaxp: For example: give a laptop away!!! What better way to draw attention

14:55:55
charafmrah: I guess your quality of the camera and setup is what draws ppl in initially

14:55:55
<transcript>: Like just trying to figure out how to distill what I've learned in a year on Twitch.

14:55:56
phlox____: people watch you for one of 3 reasons on twitch: 1) you're good at what you do 2) you're funny/have a good personality 3) you're good looking

14:56:15
<transcript>: What I've learned. And how could I help other devs find this? Because it's just a passion of mine. It came out of nowhere. I'd like other people to find it. Zoul rips that muse. Oh, you mean like we're not working on statins now because we're just talking about this. It's true. It happens. That's why I have a limited window of my day where I stream, and then the rest of the time, I get so much work done.

14:56:18
<transcript>: So much work.

14:56:18
<transcript>: i'm so productive

14:56:19
<transcript>: I'm so productive.

14:56:19
<transcript>: i really

14:56:20
cohan: @charafmrah haha it was the "adam.dev" neon in the background that caught my eye.. definitely gonna need to grab one LUL

14:56:28
<transcript>: I really support this. And hopefully one day I will be a streamer, create some stuff, inspiring people. That's right. Two rings. That's my goal. My goal is that hopefully.

14:56:28
<transcript>: the people who

14:56:38
<transcript>: The people who want to do that will do that and that they won't have things that get in their way of doing that. Have you tried the coworkers Twitch thing? Just sit down and do your stuff while others judge.

14:56:38
<transcript>: i

14:56:40
tnkhanh: are you waiting for statmuse to get acquired?

14:56:40
cohan: from the thumb I mean

14:56:42
<transcript>: I've not. I can't seem to stop interacting with people.

14:56:42
<transcript>: i

14:56:48
<transcript>: I know. Probably some coworking streams. They like, do the pomodoro timer. I've watched them like they have like a Photo.

14:56:48
<transcript>: like

14:56:57
<transcript>: Like they're on focus mode and don't talk to them. I don't do that. So most of my stream I just end up talking. I should have probably go into the just chatting, but what.

14:57:15
<transcript>: Dax is back. David said he's mad at you, but wouldn't explain why. Oh, I know that trick you just told me. You're gonna tell him that I see what you just did. Adam is going on around a rant. Yeah, yeah. I'm not wanting to stream my workday, but side projects, I'm learning flutter and how to build apps. So we'll definitely assume my code is guard. There you go. If it's new technology for you.

14:57:15
<transcript>: you're gonna be

14:57:18
zxshan: I first watched your stream when you were setting up your camera rig and animations etc. really enjoyed the process and now like seeing it being in use

14:57:19
<transcript>: You're gonna be super bad at it. And that's even better, because there's just no expectation.

14:57:29
<transcript>: And just explain that to people that like, you want to learn some new stuff. Twitch is the best place to learn new stuff. As a dev, I promise you I learned vim, movements.

14:57:29
<transcript>: one hundred

14:57:30
zxshan: I enjoy you doing pieces to camera like this talking bout stuff

14:57:35
<transcript>: 100 times faster than I would have alone in my office, watching tutorials or whatever.

14:57:36
aisebaxp: Adam eliminating the competition vamoaThink

14:57:49
crintusza: For what it's worth, I'm still building up the courage to start, but I've been thinking about it for a while, and your "why" in your bio has been the biggest boost to start.

14:57:54
zxshan: I also watch @JDotW for coworking streams

14:57:55
<transcript>: Do some vim movements on screen on Twitch with some people following and watching and you will quickly learn how better to do them now. Obviously not that well because I'm still Jay and King my way everywhere, all over the file, and no matter how much you guys make fun of me, I will continue to smash that J key until I get to the line. I went to get to that'll just never click for me, but we all have a C.

14:57:55

tnkhanh: chat is your vim teacher!

14:58:09
<transcript>: Ceiling. It's fine. Chat. We are just here to pair program. That's right. It's just like I got 180 pair programmers here right now. It's the best. I've already wondered what it's like to stream to zero people. That's my biggest fear of starting. So I definitely.

14:58:09
<transcript>: i mean i stream

14:58:11
<transcript>: I mean I stream to zero people.

14:58:16
<transcript>: The first two streams. It was very, very.

14:58:16
<transcript>: strange

14:58:17
<transcript>: Strange.

14:58:17
<transcript>: because i

14:58:21
<transcript>: Because I just immediately when you do your first dream.

14:58:25
<transcript>: It's gonna be awful think you're gonna be super nervous? You're gonna be.

14:58:25
<transcript>: just this

14:58:39
<transcript>: Just this weird feeling of, like, I'm talking out loud. I know nobody's watching. Like, clearly, I'm looking at the count of viewers. There's no one here, but I'm gonna keep talking as if there is, because I gotta start doing that. I gotta start talking.

14:58:39
<transcript>: so

14:58:42
<transcript>: So I just tried to, like, literally.

14:58:42
<transcript>: externally

14:58:47
<transcript>: Externally process everything in my brain as I was working on whatever I was working on and I think.

14:58:47
<transcript>: the thing that i

14:58:56
<transcript>: The thing that I hooked people with that people came in for was like, Why are your cameras good? Like, Why is your camera so good? Why do you look so good? Why can I see the pores on your face.

14:58:56
<transcript>: that was

14:58:57
tobs_on_twitch: I talk out loud when I'm coding already LuL

14:59:04
<transcript>: That was that was my thing. I don't know. Just spend a lot of money. And that's how I hooked people chat. We were just here. Oh, I already read that.

14:59:04
tnkhanh: wow, amazing start, Adam

14:59:09
1camou: why do you look so good

14:59:11
thdxr: this rant is better than what we recorded yesterday

14:59:14
<transcript>: Hi, there. What about getting your first few viewers? Do you think Twitter or discord or good avenues for that? So, yeah, chara, I wouldn't have had viewers if I didn't have a Twitter following. I had something like 150 followers on Twitter.

14:59:14
<transcript>: and

14:59:18
<transcript>: And I would just tweet every single time I went live.

14:59:18
<transcript>: and i actually

14:59:21
<transcript>: And I actually made a little video. I still do. I make a little video.

14:59:26
fragaverage: Adams growrh on twitch was not typical

14:59:27
jonasync: Talking to myself is how I am rolling right now LUL

14:59:30
<transcript>: Just usually at the beginning, it was like, hey, I'm live on twitch. Come hang out, please, please. And then some people did. So people would come from Twitter.

14:59:31
fragaverage: growth*

14:59:50
<transcript>: And then I started making the videos just about random stuff. Just whatever was on my mind that morning, I just record a little, like, 32nd thing, put it on Twitter. And I think that's really how I started on twitch. That's the only reason I built up any kind of a following was just people coming from Twitter because they already knew me. So I think if you're starting from, like, no online presence, it's gonna be a tough time. You're gonna.

14:59:51
<transcript>: stream to nobody

14:59:59
tnkhanh: now I'm focusing on the pores on your face

15:00:01
<transcript>: Stream to nobody for a long time. And that's not fun. So maybe work on building up kind of an audience. Hate that word. Build up following whatever a community.

15:00:01
<transcript>: build that up

15:00:07
daglee: I'm 99% sure I will miss the first episode of rebase because I signed up so long before airing.

15:00:09
pedrosillano: Different audiences, aren't they?

15:00:09
cohan: audience is better than fans LUL

15:00:11
<transcript>: Build that up elsewhere. And then once you have that, I think it's gonna make a lot easier to have a few viewers. Even. I think my first few streams, you know, is 3510 people, maybe.

15:00:17
stroopwafel26: IM BACK BABY

15:00:27
<transcript>: After I. Tweeted enough and annoyed people enough that they would show up, and then they stuck around and they kind of, like, would keep coming back. And you developed a little bit of a rapport with People loan traveler pedro Ramireo, captain.

15:00:29
tayloreddev: yeah this is my stuggle joined twitter and twitch at the same time

15:00:37
<transcript>: Split software. Thank you all for the followups. I don't know if I got all of the new ones. Yeah, that's all the new ones. Oh, no, I didn't. Harsh. Thank you for the follow. Harsh. Okay, I'm gonna keep reading.

15:00:39
ezteq: first step: build a big onlyfans audience, then go to twitch

15:00:41
<transcript>: I got started by Saving Adams Following. There you go, dad.

15:00:51
oetziofficial: when I joined, you had troubles with livestreaming the obs feed to some aws server thing, no idea what you did there xD

15:00:53
aisebaxp: You have a easy going voice and that helps a lot

15:00:58
<transcript>: Yeah. Hang out another streamers. Other steamer streams. That's another thing. Early on, I had never been on twitch prior to starting my streaming journey. If you will. I'm just saying a lot of cringy words. My streaming journey as I built my audience.

15:00:58
<transcript>: and

15:01:02
<transcript>: And my community began to form. I educate all those words.

15:01:02
<transcript>: but as

15:01:22
<transcript>: But as I was getting started on streaming, I was learning about twitch as well for the first time. So I was hanging out. I discovered Prime, I discovered trash, Dev and Tea and all these people acorn. And just like these wonderful streamers getting into their twitch chat and interacting with them and learning like, who are these people? What makes them tick? How are they doing? What they're doing.

15:01:28
<transcript>: I think that's super helpful. So you're you're already there. You're halfway there. You're hanging out my Twitch chat.

15:01:28
<transcript>: that's

15:01:29
<transcript>: That's a good start.

15:01:29
<transcript>: start kind of like

15:01:33
<transcript>: Start kind of like getting plugged in. And that helps.

15:01:42
<transcript>: Adam. Random question in your Why you mentioned video courses. Did you ever film any? I filmed some things. Alan.

15:01:42
<transcript>: did i

15:01:45
<transcript>: Did I ever finish any. No.

15:01:45
<transcript>: i start

15:01:47
<transcript>: I start a lot of things.

15:01:53
<transcript>: This is something I need to be better about. I start a lot of things that I don't finish.

15:01:53
<transcript>: and

15:01:57
harshadlal: Love the aesthetic you have!

15:02:00
stroopwafel26: @OetziOfficial for transcription

15:02:07
<transcript>: And video courses are one of those things. You know what it is with video courses. I know. Here's the thing about me. I know if I do something, I'm going to do it really well. If I make a video course, it will be excellent.

15:02:07
<transcript>: like i just

15:02:11
<transcript>: Like I just know. I'll make sure it's really, really good.

15:02:11
<transcript>: lots of people

15:02:16
<transcript>: Lots of people will learn a lot from that video course it'll be worth doing.

15:02:19
<transcript>: My problem is.

15:02:19
<transcript>: that

15:02:32
<transcript>: That I don't really want to be a course guy. I just it's a psychology thing for me. There's so many things I don't do because I have this negative perception of it. People who put out tutorials and who make courses.

15:02:32
<transcript>: there's

15:02:39
<transcript>: There's just some wonderful people that do this. And they make excellent resources. But just a few bad ones, a few grifters.

15:02:39
<transcript>: totally

15:02:40
thdxr: Adams real passion is a game show host

15:02:52
<transcript>: Totally ruins my perception of it. And I just worry that if I do it, I'll come off to some any. Just one person even will think I'm a grifter. And that's just cuts me too deep. It offends me. Maybe. I don't know. Dax. Maybe I am offended.

15:02:52
<transcript>: just the idea

15:02:56
thdxr: OMG I FIGURED ADAM OUT

15:03:05
thdxr: I got your psychology are you ready

15:03:08
<transcript>: Just the idea of people perceiving me as a grifter is enough that I just don't make courses. And it's sad because I know I could help a lot of people. I know I could, like, take the time, I would do it right. And I would make sure I took people on a journey of learning from here to there. It would be so good.

15:03:08
<transcript>: and

15:03:20
<transcript>: And I don't because I just I worry about people thinking I'm just trying to cash grab or something. I guess if I make it free, but make the course free, they won't think I'm a grifter, but then I'll spend a whole lot of time.

15:03:20
<transcript>: and i can't do

15:03:22
<transcript>: And I can't do that all the time.

15:03:22
<transcript>: doing

15:03:26
<transcript>: Doing a whole lot of time things for free.

15:03:30
kevinnaughtonjr: offer a money back guarantee :)

15:03:38
cohan: totally get it, I'd feel so weird giving information away for a price.. I'm not doing any work for them! (ignoring the effort creating it) LUL

15:03:39
<transcript>: Spot on most that complain if they get no viewers have the driest personalities. I think some people would resonate with a dry personality. It just maybe fewer people than would resonate with a nondry a wet personality.

15:03:41
oetziofficial: oh you are definitely not a grifter

15:03:42
kryotoboi: Bucky from TheNewBoston is a legend in my head !

15:03:44
<transcript>: There are dry, sensitive humor. Are there wet senses of humor.

15:03:50
<transcript>: Okay just answered you good deal need to be attention worthy.

15:03:51
tropichana: Do you have a video on your set up and equipment you use for your stream?

15:03:54
kryotoboi: He taught me Qt back in the day

15:03:55
<transcript>: We're all worthy of attention ToB's we're all worthy of it.

15:03:55
<transcript>: just

15:03:55
securibee: You could have companies sponsor your course that you then put out for free

15:03:57
<transcript>: Just some.

15:03:57
<transcript>: more

15:04:01
<transcript>: More than others. I don't know. I tried to just like be.

15:04:01
<transcript>: more inclusive

15:04:04
overra_dev: slapstick sounds wet

15:04:04
thdxr: everything you do needs to be something no one is done before, otherwise you will see a comparison to someone else that's doing that. and it's likely that person has > 0 negative traits and you feel like that's projected on to you

15:04:07
cohan: LUL

15:04:11
tobs_on_twitch: LuL

15:04:13
oetziofficial: you are an expert in your field, and I'm very happy to be here :D

15:04:15
<transcript>: More inclusive there or something. I got bullied into it by dax. It's making me so happy. Because I can't see that word because I something was so bored before. Yeah, it's a great. Like when you reach this point in your career where you're just kind of bored.

15:04:15
<transcript>: after a certain amount

15:04:17
maleero: I have more of a damp personality

15:04:28
<transcript>: After a certain amount of time, there's only so much that's gonna get you going. You know what I mean? Like you start writing some software one day and you realize like you've been doing it for ten years, and it's just not that exciting anymore. Twitch was a great.

15:04:28
<transcript>: great

15:04:29
<transcript>: Great.

15:04:34
kryotoboi: Adam can you make a tutorial for how to be non-offendable

15:04:36
<transcript>: Okay, Adam, hold my beer. You got it.

15:04:41
rebeldecibel: we are all equal, it's just some are more equal than others :)

15:04:43
<transcript>: This is your beer. I'm proverbially and physically holding it.

15:04:44
barryxbtw: dry humor is just humor without emotion, it is not an opposition of anything

15:05:00
stroopwafel26: this?

15:05:00
<transcript>: For example, give a lab top away. What better way to draw attention? That is another way. So the laptop thing, it's gonna start seeming gimmicky because I keep giving away laptops. Honestly, I just really enjoy the idea of somebody that actually needed a laptop getting a laptop. And now having this ability to do all these things.

15:05:00
<transcript>: in this

15:05:02
<transcript>: In this digital driven world.

15:05:18
kryotoboi: I need a apple Pro Res 😫

15:05:18
<transcript>: It's worked out when I've given things like that away. It's always landed in somebody's lap that really needed it. So I'm kind of addicted to that feeling now, so I do actually want someone here to win it, but I want it to be the randomness that hands it to the right person.

15:05:18
<transcript>: and that's

15:05:21
<transcript>: And that's my hope we'll see.

15:05:21
<transcript>: if the wrong person

15:05:24
<transcript>: If the wrong person gets it, I may have to reevaluate.

15:05:24
<transcript>: it's like

15:05:33
<transcript>: It's like somebody who's doing fine. And they have, like, three macbooks. And they win my macbook. It'll be a little depressing, but we'll move on. Hasn't happened yet, though. Jonah, thank you for that. Follow.

15:05:33
<transcript>: okay

15:05:35
<transcript>: Okay, I guess.

15:05:35
<transcript>: your quality of

15:05:41
jonasync: What if an evil person gets it?

15:05:49
<transcript>: Your quality of the camera and setup is what draws people in it. Yeah. I think that was my that was my hook. Is I'm gonna have a really good production value. Like you're gonna watch this and feel like you're watching a Netflix documentary, but it's gonna be this doofus writing code. That's not very good.

15:06:00
stroopwafel26: here's my promise: if i win it (lol i won't), i will give it away to someone in need

15:06:01
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat flocks. People watch you for one of three reasons on Twitch. You're good at what you do. You're funny. Having good personality. You're a goodlooking interesting. Has this been documented? I didn't know this about Twitch.

15:06:01
<transcript>: that's

15:06:04
<transcript>: That's interesting. It sounds accurate.

15:06:08
<transcript>: Yeah. It seems like that's probably right.

15:06:08
<transcript>: it's not like

15:06:11
<transcript>: It's not like TV or something. Probably.

15:06:21
<transcript>: Haha. It was the Adam Devne on the background that come. I definitely gonna grab a need to grab one. Yeah, my wife got me that. Are you waiting for status to get quired? I'm not waiting for it.

15:06:21
<transcript>: i

15:06:26
<transcript>: I wouldn't kick and acquire out of bed, you know, I mean, we almost got acquired a few times.

15:06:26
<transcript>: so disney and

15:06:34
<transcript>: So Disney and Google have invested in Statmeues. And generally when big companies like that invest in you for strategic reasons, they're also in.

15:06:34
<transcript>: interested

15:06:49
oetziofficial: disney? WHUT

15:06:53
jonasync: Holup, aren't programmers supposed to be pasty and unattractive? LUL

15:06:55
<transcript>: Interested in acquisition. It's rare that a strategic investment like that where it's not a venture capital fund like Disney is the walt Disney Company. They don't just invest in companies for funds, ease to see if they can hit it big on their investments. They do it because they're interested in what that company's doing and how it strategically aligns with their business. So there's always any time a strategic company.

15:06:55
<transcript>: like that invest

15:06:56
securibee: @jonasync they could band together with @thdxr for the villain arc

15:07:04
<transcript>: Like that invests in your fundraising round. They're also interested in acquiring it's just natural. So both Disney and Google have tried at various times.

15:07:04
<transcript>: we

15:07:06
<transcript>: We that's the whole story.

15:07:06
<transcript>: we did not

15:07:12
<transcript>: We did not get acquired, so there's been some close calls. Tab. Thank you for that follow. I really appreciate it.

15:07:14
fragaverage: how DOES statmuse align with Disney's products?

15:07:27
<transcript>: I first watch your stream when you were setting up your camera rig and animations really enjoy the process. And now like seeing it being in use. Yeah. I definitely went through that phase. That's another thing. If you're a developer and you start streaming on twitch, you are going to go through a phase. It's like.

15:07:27
<transcript>: the college dri

15:07:41
<transcript>: The College drinking phase here in the US, like you're gonna go through a phase where you just want to do everything you can possibly do with the twitch api. You're gonna write your own overlays. You're gonna fiddle with the api and ChannelPoint redemptions and everything you could possibly do.

15:07:41
<transcript>: and

15:07:48
<transcript>: And that'll it's also fun and just enjoy. Embrace it. It's just gonna be a part of it.

15:07:48
<transcript>: hopefully

15:07:52
<transcript>: Hopefully you can spare the time because you're gonna spend a lot of time on it.

15:07:53
jonasync: @securibee Kappa

15:07:53
oetziofficial: thats for sure a new podcast episode @adamdotdev talk about the disney/google thing on an episode :)

15:07:59
<transcript>: And then you kind of get through it. And then you get to just enjoy the fruits of your life. Get to enjoy your streaming setup from there forward.

15:08:05
<transcript>: Enjoy doing pieces to camera. Like this. Talking about stuff. Yeah. I enjoy talking like this.

15:08:05
<transcript>: obviously

15:08:06
<transcript>: Obviously.

15:08:07
cohan: I have a whole load of notes on my Twitch bot.. I'll stream one day LUL

15:08:11
<transcript>: Adam Eliminating The Competition. Wait. What Should I do.

15:08:11
<transcript>: for what it's worth

15:08:26
<transcript>: For what it's worth, I'm still building up the courage to start, but I've been thinking about it for a while. And your why in your bio has been the biggest boost to start. What was my why remind me. I mean, I know why I'm streaming it's mostly because I enjoy hanging out with you people. I keep saying, you people.

15:08:32
<transcript>: I'll also watch jw for coworking streams. That's not a name I'm familiar with. I will have to check them out.

15:08:53
<transcript>: Chat is my vim teacher. Am I that behind? That was a long time. I talked about that talk out loud when I'm coding already. Wow. Amazing start. Adam, why do you look so good? This rant is better than what we recorded yesterday. I know, dax. I just need a more time. A podcast format. I don't get to get on a roll, you know, like you can just go from zero to interesting insights in three.

15:08:53
<transcript>: seconds

15:08:59
<transcript>: Seconds and for me I got a talk for a good like 15 minutes before it starts getting it interesting.

15:08:59
<transcript>: it's not

15:09:05
<transcript>: It's not good in the world of attention spans and TikTok and whatever dinosaur.

15:09:05
<transcript>: no dis

15:09:06
<transcript>: No dis.

15:09:07
<transcript>: disosauru

15:09:16
<transcript>: Disosauru thank you for the follow. I started to say, welcome to chat. Maybe you joined the chat, but what you actually did is follow me and I appreciate it.

15:09:16
<transcript>: adams

15:09:23
<transcript>: Adams growth on Twitch was not typically yeffrak. I remember you saying I was growing very fast. You were sending me charts. That was not normal.

15:09:37
<transcript>: Talking to myself. Welcome, jonah, to chat. Talking about how I am rolling right now. Yeah. No, that's how it goes. If Joan, did you have a presence anywhere else online? Do you hang out on discord or do you hang out on reddit or Twitter or.

15:09:49
<transcript>: Facebook. I don't know. Do people hate it on Facebook? Instagram. Tik Tok Tok tiktok's. Probably a great place to build some kind of an audience really fast and then translate that to hanging out on Twitch.

15:09:56
<transcript>: Now I'm focused on the pores on your face. Wow. That's a reference for me. I know how long ago I said that I'm gonna have to Scroll.

15:09:56
<transcript>: holy cow you can

15:09:59
<transcript>: Holy Cow, you can have been talking so much.

15:10:03
<transcript>: Oh, man, I really want to read all of it, though.

15:10:03
<transcript>: stroo

15:10:10
<transcript>: Stroop is back. Audience is better than fans. Ooh, that is better fans's. That's really bad.

15:10:17
<transcript>: Night Option Sharon is first episode of rebates because I signed up so long before airing. No, no, you won't miss it. We will make sure dagli is the.

15:10:17
<transcript>: welcome to

15:10:24
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat pedro. Different audiences, aren't they? Yeah. You know, a totally different audiences. But if you don't have any kind of an audience.

15:10:24
<transcript>: then

15:10:32
<transcript>: Then it's gonna be hard. I think on twitch. I think it's discovery's, not great. Things can be hard for you to build up an audience starting on Twitter. If that makes sense.

15:10:35
<transcript>: Okay, I'm gonna try and Scroll.

15:10:35
<transcript>: maybe strugg

15:10:41
<transcript>: Maybe struggle. Join Twitter and twitch the same time you'll get their tailor. Just keep to Twitter as much easier to just like.

15:10:41
<transcript>: put

15:10:52
<transcript>: Put in work and build an audience. You just tweet every day tweet interesting stuff, no things about things people care about and tweet about it. And eventually you will be able to build an audience on Twitter.

15:10:52
<transcript>: first

15:10:57
<transcript>: First step, build a big only fancy audience and go to twitch. Sounds like that would probably work too.

15:10:57
<transcript>: chris card

15:11:09
<transcript>: Chris Card. Thank you for the follow. When I joined you had troubles with live stream the obsc to some aws. Everything. No idea what you did there. Yes. I was trying to use ibs. I don't remember why? Just like I know things about aws. So I'm gonna use it.

15:11:09
<transcript>: you have

15:11:16
<transcript>: You have an easygoing voice. And that helps a lot. I also have a nice keyboard. There you go. Here's a little tip. This is just a tip.

15:11:16
<transcript>: you want to

15:11:23
<transcript>: You want to grow it's a developer streaming on twitch. Get a nice keyboard, nice microphone that can hear your keyboard.

15:11:23
<transcript>: and

15:11:30
<transcript>: And that'll go a long way. People like to just listen to me type. I don't do it enough because I'm too busy talking.

15:11:34
charafmrah: was there a particular tweet that made you go viral on twitter? or is it just consistent effort

15:11:36
<transcript>: Thank you. Thank you for joining the Chat harsh. I love the aesthetic you have. I appreciate that so much.

15:11:47
walter_riveros: Let's hear some keyboard noises

15:11:56
<transcript>: And I'm just real passionate as a game show host, you figured me out. You got my psychology. I'm ready. I'm ready. Give it to me. Google's Word grifter. Kevin nan and welcome to Chat. Offer a money back guarantee that's an option. Okay, so if I want to go the course route, man, I'm still behind on chat. If I want to welcome Kevin, I know Kevin from Twitter. I've seen you around for a long time.

15:11:56
<transcript>: it's nice

15:12:17
<transcript>: It's nice to see you in my twitch chat. That's a good call. Offer a money back guarantee. There are ways like plenty of people make courses and they're excellent. And they're not grifters. Matt poke just came out with this typescript course. It's fantastic. It's great. He's not a grifter. Most of them probably aren't cryptors. It's just a few bad apples that make a course, and they're just cash grabbing. And it's not very good. And it doesn't really.

15:12:17
<transcript>: teach people

15:12:21
<transcript>: Teach people and then like, for me, the whole thing is just ruined. I don't know.

15:12:27
exjers: i'm just here to watch when the larabar wrappers come bursting out of the closet like an avalanche.

15:12:27
<transcript>: Okay, are you definitely not a grifter? Becky from the New Boston is the legend in my head? What.

15:12:32
<transcript>: A Bucky from the newbossin do you have a video on your setup and equipment used.

15:12:32
<transcript>: top traffic

15:12:34
<transcript>: Top traffic. I did an office tour.

15:12:34
<transcript>: it's in

15:12:42
<transcript>: It's in my vods. You'll have to go back through my vods. Look for one that's, like about the office, and you can watch that one. It's pretty long. You could skip around.

15:13:02
aisebaxp: ASMR keyboard... a huge category miduLol

15:13:02
<transcript>: Me. Qt back in it. I'm good. Have to go faster. Everything you do needs to be something no one has done before. Oh, my God. Dax figured me out. Hang on. I'm not very selfaware, so I need to read this very carefully. Dadx is looking into my soul and teaching me about myself. Everything you do needs to be something no one is done before. Otherwise, you will see a couple.

15:13:06
kevinnaughtonjr: happy to be here! :)

15:13:08
<transcript>: Doing that. And it's likely that person has greater than zero negative traits. And you feel.

15:13:18
<transcript>: I think you figured me out. I think that's honestly, it next. I think that's honestly, I think I can't ignore the negative traits.

15:13:18
<transcript>: and i

15:13:22
kevinnaughtonjr: is your gear for the stream listed somewhere? would love to check out what you're using to get this kinda quality

15:13:23
<transcript>: And I think if I do it like them, I think I think you got it. You nailed it.

15:13:38
<transcript>: Oh, it's a you're an expert in your field. Very happy to be here. Well, I'm very happy to have you etsy. And I like, what's cool about Twitch is I like hanging out in other dev. Twitches, like hanging out in bash bunnies, Twitch chat. And oh, it's there. You know, like you get to hang out with the same people.

15:13:38
<transcript>: we all kind of

15:13:41
<transcript>: We all kind of follow each other around it's fun.

15:14:01
<transcript>: More of a damp personality. Okay, so not wet. Not dry or damp. That's good. You can work with that. Can you make a tutorial for how to be? None offendable. Honestly, I don't know. I. Sometimes I wonder if I. What do I just not have a soul? What's wrong with me? I don't feel many of emotions and I'm not offended about anything. I don't think I've ever been offended in my life. I can't think.

15:14:01
<transcript>: of a time

15:14:08
aisebaxp: Hammering the keyboard is going to be my added value on twitch

15:14:21
<transcript>: Of a time. I don't know what that emotion would feel like. Maybe that's not true. Maybe I should have a bad memory. But we're all equal to some are more equal than others. Dry humor is just humor without emotion is not an opposite of anything. Oh, that makes sense. Yeah, I guess everything is not an opposite of everything, is it? Nobody won the macbook. Let's see. I need an Apple Pro res. What if an evil person gets it? Uhoh, well, we'll just. We'll.

15:14:21
<transcript>: just hope

15:14:30

15:14:43
stroopwafel26: @adamdotdev HD650 arrived!

15:14:51
<transcript>: Disney what a Disney cares about sat me is because of ESPN. So we do force statistics research and ESPN reporters use status. That's how Disney became aware of us armed program shows we pasty and unattractive. Mostly we are they could ban together with dax for the villain arc.

15:14:51
<transcript>: how does that mean

15:14:55
<transcript>: How does that mean with disney's Products? Espn? I think I just answered that.

15:14:55
<transcript>: let's

15:15:05
<transcript>: Let's see that's for sure. A new podcast. Episode. Talk about the Disney Google thing on an episode. Okay. Yeah. I've got all kinds of samue stories I could share. Dax, I don't know if you want to hear any of those. We could talk about those on tomorrow.

15:15:05
<transcript>: i have

15:15:10
<transcript>: I have a whole load of notes on my twitchbot. I'll stream one day.

15:15:10
<transcript>: please do

15:15:12
<transcript>: Please, do you have a twitchbot.

15:15:17
<transcript>: Or you mean you've been putting your notes on to a twitchbot.

15:15:26
<transcript>: So what you mean, was there a particular tweet that made you go viral on Twitter, or is it just consistent ever. So here's a good question. Shara Twitter. You want to hear some keyboard noises? I just saw Walter.

15:15:26
<transcript>: let's just

15:15:36
<transcript>: Let's just give you some keyboard noises. I'll just do this intermittently while I'm typing or while I'm talking. Oh, come on. I just want to type. There's no type. Can I just type in here without.

15:15:43
<transcript>: Okay. I'll just be doing this one typing or talking so you guys can at least the don't care what I have to say. Get something out of it.

15:15:48
<transcript>: This is gonna look really funny. Like I actually am just like typing without looking.

15:15:52
<transcript>: So was there a particular tweet that made me go viral.

15:15:52
<transcript>: yeah

15:16:02
cohan: re twitch bot notes: notes on how it'd work, features etc. Go to code it -> oh right yeah I don't have a channel to use it in yet lol

15:16:08
<transcript>: Yeah. In fact, I complain a lot because my Twitter following like, I'm like, who are these people? They don't interact with anything I say. And then I remember that most everyone that follows me follows me from, like, four or five Tweets. So I had four or five Tweets that blew up.

15:16:08
<transcript>: after other people

15:16:14
<transcript>: After other people's experiences, I did not build a consistent Twitter following. I did not like tweet.

15:16:14
<transcript>: consistently

15:16:15
lesabotsy: Love y'all but if I win it I keep it, I'm still rocking a Thinkpad T440 :p

15:16:28
<transcript>: Consistently, often inside, like, dax every day. And then eventually, people are like, Man, this guy's smart. I'm gonna follow him for the right reasons. I tweeted stuff like, hey, I make a lot of money, check out my awesome house, and then, like, thousands of people would follow me.

15:16:38
<transcript>: So now I have this following on Twitter. That's like I feel like I should explain why I'm typing. I'm just typing so you guys can hear my awesome keyboard. That's all. Now I have all these people to follow me.

15:16:38
<transcript>: and when

15:16:38
natenorberg: what are you typing?

15:16:45
<transcript>: And when I talk about programming stuff, I'm like, hey, look at this cool language feature. People are like, who are you? What? Why do I follow you.

15:16:47
1camou: i love this personal portfolio because someone asked for inspiration earlier https://hen-ry.com/

15:41:44
<transcript>: Instance dot.

15:41:44
<transcript>: so

15:41:55
<transcript>: So we have the endpoint. This is cool. So I can actually do this now. I can import the thing. I don't know if I need to now. Yeah, I do because I knew to do from instance.

15:41:58
maleero: I’m in Springfield too. I might be able to make it 😂

15:41:59
<transcript>: Let's see, we're gonna call this.

15:42:01
<transcript>: Instance.

15:42:04
nate_codes: 23:49 drive from where I'm at...prepping the car

15:42:07
<transcript>: Metadata. I don't know. Instance. Metadata. Is that bad.

15:42:08
studiojvla: Hey I had a vim related question? How do you handle creating files while inside a buffer?

15:42:12
<transcript>: Instance. Identifier. Let's just do this. Let's.

15:42:17
<transcript>: Instance. Identifier. This is gonna it's gonna end up being dynamic, right.

15:42:18
rebeldecibel: 10 more channel points till my MacBook :D

15:42:21
<transcript>: But for now, let's do this.

15:42:30
studiojvla: I've been trying to get into Lunarvim and it's great, but this is the last pattern i'm sort of missing

15:42:31
<transcript>: Instance. Identifier. Yeah. Okay.

15:42:31
<transcript>: and then

15:42:34
<transcript>: And then here, down here, we can do.

15:42:37
<transcript>: At.

15:42:37
<transcript>: and then

15:42:37
fragaverage: 32hr return flight, nope. im out

15:42:40
<transcript>: And then instant endpoint address. This is going to be.

15:42:44
<transcript>: Instance metadata.

15:42:44
<transcript>: endpoint

15:42:46
<transcript>: Endpoint.

15:42:47
<transcript>: What.

15:42:47
<transcript>: address

15:42:49
<transcript>: Address.

15:42:54
<transcript>: Oh, do I need to have the Port no address? And then the Port goes down here.

15:42:58
<transcript>: Instance metadata.

15:42:58
<transcript>: yeah like that

15:42:59
<transcript>: Yeah like that.

15:43:03
<transcript>: Okay.

15:43:08
<transcript>: Doesn't like that. It could be null. How do I just like.

15:43:13
<transcript>: I know it exists.

15:43:18
<transcript>: This is so bad, isn't it? Should I not do this? This feels bad. Feels very dirty.

15:43:18
<transcript>: type number

15:43:23
<transcript>: Type number or undefined? Well, it's not undefined now, is it? We know it exists.

15:43:26
<transcript>: We know it does.

15:43:28
rebeldecibel: noooooo :D

15:43:34
<transcript>: Oh, no. We're gonna get murdered now. No, we're not. It's fine. Nobody's coming.

15:43:34
<transcript>: we'll

15:43:39
<transcript>: We'll get an ics invite for the event in our mails. Probably not cryo. You just have to remember.

15:43:45
cowfacedev: @StudioJVLA personally I use something else to create the files. In my case I use lf file explorer in a terminal.

15:43:53
<transcript>: Fly's retie just $2500 return? Hey, that'd be a fun one? That'd be a fun one? What if I did a redeem? Ooh, ooh, I have an idea. What if I did a redeem instead of winning a macbook? You win a trip to nixon, Missouri.

15:43:53
<transcript>: to hang

15:43:55
<transcript>: To hang out.

15:43:55
<transcript>: is that even

15:43:56
rebeldecibel: best spent channel points ever though

15:44:08
vapor__dev: lmfao can't wait for you to tell your family

15:44:08
<transcript>: Is that even a rewards anyone want that no one would redeem it if I had MacBook like chance at a MacBook or chance it slide and meet me. No one would ever reading that one. It would just keep saving points and redeeming the MacBook and I would be offended.

15:44:10
<transcript>: Better not do that.

15:44:12
joostschuur: 69% chance to win a MacBook if you fly to meet Adam in person

15:44:19
<transcript>: See all. Then I'm just kind of going back.

15:44:21
vapor__dev: "so guys...this guy coderdev999 is  flying in to stay with us"

15:44:24
<transcript>: I had a Vmwarelated question. How do you handle creating files while inside a buffer.

15:44:24
<transcript>: i don't

15:44:24
dmdboi: If you add that, can you double the Macbook chance

15:44:25
joostschuur: But you only get one redeem

15:44:27
<transcript>: I don't, but I think you could just do, like.

15:44:27
<transcript>: this

15:44:29
<transcript>: This like touch and then create file right.

15:44:29
<transcript>: like

15:44:34
basileus__: oil plugin

15:44:37
maleero: The area is actually really fun. I bet people would take you up on it

15:44:49
studiojvla: Yeah that's what I was looking for!

15:44:49
<transcript>: Like that or is e. Does E do that? Opens a file. I don't remember. I use inventory a lot, and I just create files this way, like a and then I type the file. It's probably like the newbie way to do it. I don't know. Like you have a crutch. You need a tree view to make files. I don't know.

15:44:50
kryotoboi: Even better redeem, if you win Adam come see you LUL

15:44:55
<transcript>: Maliro you're in springfield. You might be able to make it hey, come down, mileero. Seriously.

15:44:55
<transcript>: we will the three

15:44:58
<transcript>: We will. The three of us have a little Twitch.

15:44:58
<transcript>: twitch

15:45:00
<transcript>: Twitch chat, coffee.

15:45:01
dimzosaur: :e edits a new buffer then you have to write it

15:45:02
<transcript>: That's awesome.

15:45:02
<transcript>: twenty three

15:45:03
studiojvla: I'm used to Cmd+0, {A,a} in VSCode

15:45:06
<transcript>: 23, 49 drive from where I'm at prepping. The car.

15:45:20
<transcript>: That'd be so funny. If nate showed up like he wasn't even joking. I had a vim. Really question. Okay, I just answered that ten more channel points. So my macbook. Uh oh, rebel. Uh, I feel like I'm gonna scroll down and see that you did not win a macbook. I did, in fact, see it. Sorry.

15:45:20
<transcript>: i've been trying

15:45:21
studiojvla: I just want to be able to do it without leaving the flow. Esp when writing React components etc.

15:45:24
<transcript>: I've been trying to get into Lunarvim, and it's great, but this is the last pattern I'm sort of missing.

15:45:35
<transcript>: Yeah, I just use inventory. I don't know. That's how I create files. I like to see it. I like to see where the file is gonna land with my very own eyes in a tree view? Preferably.

15:45:45
<transcript>: Well, there's always next time, Rebel. Maybe you'll get a next time. Personally, I use something else to create the files. In my case, I use lf file Explorer in a terminal. I don't know what that is.

15:45:52
<transcript>: Best bitch ever. That's what I thought. Can't wait for you to tell your family. Tell me. Tell my family what vapor.

15:45:55
<transcript>: Can't wait for me to tell my family.

15:45:55
<transcript>: that

15:46:00
<transcript>: That. Oh, so, guys, this this guy coded to have nine, nine is flying in to stay with us. That's funny.

15:46:10
<transcript>: Yo 69 chance to win a MacBook could be fly to me that I'm in person oh, there you go we could up the chances if you fly if you spin your points on that.

15:46:10
<transcript>: you get more

15:46:13
<transcript>: You get more of a chance to win a MacBook.

15:46:28
<transcript>: Can we double the macbook chance? Okay, I gotta go faster. Oil plugin. The area is actually really fun. I bet people would take you up on it. Get for real. I think it'd be cool. That's what I was looking for. Even better. Redeem, if you win. Adam, come see you.

15:46:28
<transcript>: my wife

15:46:34
<transcript>: My wife does not like when I travel, I have to be very selective with my travel. I'm gonna try to go to a couple tech conferences this year.

15:46:34
<transcript>: so

15:46:41
<transcript>: So there's another question, what is their big onto this year? What Tech conferences do you go to? Is anyone going to twitch, Con.

15:46:45
<transcript>: Og. Txmo. Thank you for that. Follow.

15:46:49
cowfacedev: @StudioJVLA I'd say it depends on your habits.

15:46:53
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Dot, dimzo, e edits a new buffer, then you have to write it. Okay. So that's a way to create a new file.

15:47:00
<transcript>: Just want to be a little to do it without leaving the flow. Especially when writing React components. Yeah. No, that makes sense.

15:47:12
nate_codes: I'm likely going to TC...Although it is a much longer drive this year

15:47:16
<transcript>: So e. But then you have to, like, type out the whole path, don't you? That's why I like inventory. It's like I can see it with my eyeballs. I can say, okay, this is where I want to have a new file, like, components right there. And then I just hit A and type it out.

15:47:16
studiojvla: Quite often i'll do like a 'manifest file, component file, spec file' in one go

15:47:24
<transcript>: Nate, you're going to twitch Con. Although it's a much longer drive this year. Oh, yes, in Vegas, right.

15:47:26
studiojvla: and then have them all open and edit them sequentially.

15:47:34
<transcript>: Sandra.

15:47:38
<transcript>: Thank you so much. Nine months.

15:47:38
thdxr: I want to go to twitchcon to see our friends but vegas again.....

15:47:40
<transcript>: Wow.

15:47:45
<transcript>: Nine months. That's intense.

15:47:47
nate_codes: Still completely drivable for me

15:47:49
<transcript>: Thank you so much, sandra, for the rear.

15:47:52
thdxr: are you gonna go adam?

15:47:56
<transcript>: Have them all open at them. Sequence.

15:48:02
<transcript>: They actually want to go to twitchcon to see our friends. But Vegas again? I know Vegas again.

15:48:10
<transcript>: I think I'm gonna go. Dex. I think if I'm making a pitch to go anywhere this year, I think twitch Con probably hits most of the friends I want to meet in person.

15:48:10
<transcript>: there

15:48:14
<transcript>: There are so a lot of people I'd love to meet. It like a more general tech conference.

15:48:14
<transcript>: but

15:48:17
<transcript>: But twitch, cons. Probably my number one right now.

15:48:17
thdxr: lmk if you confirm

15:48:22
thdxr: I'll do it

15:48:28
<transcript>: So. Yeah. Dax, I'll talk to my wife. You talk to your wife and see if they'll let us go to Witchcon. Maybe you could bring Liz again. Did she enjoy Vegas.

15:48:30
vapor__dev: @thdxr if you guys room together im gonna RUIN you

15:48:33
<transcript>: Is that a good time for her? Okay. How do I make this.

15:48:33
<transcript>: definitely

15:48:35
<transcript>: Definitely have a thing in it.

15:48:37
<transcript>: I do this.

15:48:46
<transcript>: No. Does that change the type of this? Yeah. Db insist. Okay. So at least now it's always going to be a DB instance.

15:48:46
<transcript>: but then all of these

15:48:47
livemahs: gotta head out, bye everyone!

15:48:48
thdxr: vegas transformed her whole life because she realized she was missing a coworking space

15:48:50
<transcript>: But then all of these types are optional. And it bothers me.

15:48:52
studiojvla: isn't it the optional chain in response?.DBInstances?

15:48:53
<transcript>: So let's just do this. Let's say this.

15:48:55
<transcript>: If not instance metadata.

15:48:55
<transcript>: metadata

15:48:55
thdxr: because she used a wework every day in vegas

15:48:56
<transcript>: Metadata.

15:48:56

<transcript>: Just get hardcore.

15:49:04
<transcript>: If there's not.

15:49:04
<transcript>: metadata

15:49:04
rebeldecibel: sorry, top streamers

15:49:08
<transcript>: Metadata. Just get out of here with this thing. Don't even create a stack.

15:49:09
jonasync: Try out the telescope-file-browser plugin. It helped me detox from file trees.

15:49:11
<transcript>: That's probably bad. I don't know.

15:49:14
thdxr: @vapor__dev you still haven't told me who you are

15:49:18
<transcript>: Biggest transfer transformed her whole life because she realized she was missing a coaching space. Oh, no.

15:49:22
<transcript>: See alive. Mods. We'll see you Tuesday. Maybe sooner.

15:49:26
<transcript>: If you guys room together, I'm gonna ruin you.

15:49:33
<transcript>: Allen, we'll get a room for all three of us. Let's just get like a sweet then we can all hang out.

15:49:38
<transcript>: Isn't it the optional chain in response. Yeah, it is. I'm gonna have to get through a whole bunch of optionals here.

15:49:40
studiojvla: Ah I love telescope, but it's great for finding existing files. Haven't figured out how to use something like that for file creation

15:49:40
vapor__dev: serverless suite

15:49:43
<transcript>: She used the wii work every day in Vegas. Interesting. So now she wants one in Miami.

15:49:50
<transcript>: 50% of streamers and software in game development. Are women? Take that for diversity.

15:49:50
<transcript>: is that true

15:49:51
<transcript>: Is that true.

15:49:54
thdxr: she got one in Miami and she's been more productive

15:49:59
<transcript>: Sorry. Top streamers. Oh, top sharers, yeah, yeah, no, as it should be, I would not guess that 50% of all streamers.

15:49:59
<transcript>: but

15:49:59
vapor__dev: @thdxr just a guy in vegas with $1000 and the poker skills to make it big...

15:50:02
<transcript>: But 50% of top sharers for sure.

15:50:06
<transcript>: I think my favorite streamers on Twitter are women.

15:50:08
<transcript>: Acorn is fantastic.

15:50:11
<transcript>: And funnie is super fun.

15:50:16
<transcript>: There's bash Budget obviously White Panther.

15:50:19
<transcript>: Blanking on everybody.

15:50:19
<transcript>: blanking

15:50:21
jonasync: @studiojvla telescope-file-browser supports file operations :)

15:50:23
<transcript>: Blanking. Blanking. Blinking. Oh, oh, what's her name.

15:50:27
oetziofficial: tawniee too

15:50:28
<transcript>: Her show. She does whatever she wants. She used to live in Springfield.

15:50:34
<transcript>: Chris Nova tawni yeah, there's so many good women streamers in Dev Software. Dev.

15:50:34
<transcript>: serverless suite

15:50:36
<transcript>: Serverless Suite that sounds fun.

15:50:40
<transcript>: Let's see you still haven't told me who you are.

15:50:46
<transcript>: Yeah. Vapor. Who's vapor again? I keep. Did you change her name once they.

15:50:47
studiojvla: Oh it does? Neato

15:50:50
oetziofficial: mewtru aswell

15:50:52
<transcript>: Got one in Miami, and she's been more productive.

vapor__dev: PLEASSSE

15:50:57
overra_dev: rofl

15:51:04
<transcript>: Okay, talkie. Nito mutru, mutre as well. I'm gonna keep forgetting people. I'm gonna keep forgetting people. There are so many.

15:51:11
<transcript>: But I think I'm gonna come over here. I think I'm done with trying to just all the optionals. It just kind of got me down.

15:51:17
<transcript>: Like, I need to go through that pain and actually unwrap. How do you handle that? Like.

15:51:17
<transcript>: the abs

15:51:18
<transcript>: The ABS SDK.

15:51:32
<transcript>: Maybe returns a db if it finds one for that identifier that makes sense. I get that it might only find one if it exists. Right? That makes sense. But then like every single property is optional, or it could be undefined. How is that.

15:51:32
<transcript>: how

15:51:35
studiojvla: I'm tightening our companies TSLint/ESLint config today and my teammates are sobbing lol

15:51:42
<transcript>: How does that work? I'm gonna have to, like, have some ugly code in here to unwrap all that and make sure I have the values I need to stand up the thing I need.

15:51:42
<transcript>: it's kind of annoying

15:51:43
<transcript>: It's kind of annoying.

15:51:43

nate_codes: Round

15:53:45
<transcript>: Might be a thing. Now, what else was the first? Oh, we did our Mac, our macbook giveaway thing. So now you can redeem 10 channel points twice every stream. And maybe when a macbook, it's a very small chance. But you could. It could happen.

15:54:22
<transcript>: I decided that I was just like, too much of a habit that I started at the same time. And I ate the same time. We shifted it. We did it an hour later. It was fun. It was nice. I think I was a little more awake, which is always good.

15:54:30
<transcript>: Let's see. I surprisingly like fiddling with es and ts? Oof it's gardening. I do not. I do not like prettier.
