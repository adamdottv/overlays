11:53:08
<transcript>: i didn't have really

11:53:20
<transcript>: I didn't have really any of the Internet's perception of technology infiltrating. My brain. I was just a loan with my coworkers, I guess, and my peers. People who I was working with.

11:53:22
<transcript>: Figuring it out.

11:53:24
<transcript>: It was nice.

11:53:24
<transcript>: it's only been the last

11:53:37
<transcript>: It's only been the last couple of years that I've really kind of dove. Into the online tech world. I don't know what I'm trying to say, but. I think I'm trying to say, be careful out there, young developers.

11:53:37

Sound effects, and I don't hear that one very often. Hamida, I want to make that worth to you? The tier three? I don't know what to do about that, because. I don't know what you get with tier three right now, but you should get more. You should become like.

tastefulelk: All good here! Going on a shorter parental leave after this week, so I'm terrified. Two little monsters this time

00:16:21
<transcript>: But pretty sure you live in the US. And if so,

badcop_: its 4:30am its still dark it counts

00:16:38
<transcript>: I'm going to have to get on you and Theo about this. Tier three should be a literal explosion. That would be amazing. Actually. Pyrotechnics. Let's do it like a jump scare level explosion? Yeah, that would be good.

00:16:38
<transcript>: we can just

00:16:48
<transcript>: We can just roast Dax together. Yes, I might. I've seen you in Dax's. Chat. Let's roast. Dax. I used to have a little segment I'm going to have to get back to the segment. I wonder if they still work.

00:16:48
<transcript>: like if i

00:16:51
<transcript>: Like if I click the button, what will happen?

00:17:03
<transcript>: Actually, I don't know if that's the Dax. If that's the Dax. As a guest button, or Dax is the Dax sacks. You remember we used to do Dax sacks? That was funny, those good times.

00:17:03
<transcript>: let's see

00:17:07
<transcript>: Let's see. Nice scam. You just haven't won yet. It's not. A scam.

00:17:13
<transcript>: Ten is the absolute goat. Well, in that case, I'm so glad my hair looks like tinted.

00:17:13
<transcript>: going

00:17:29
<transcript>: Going on shorter parental leave after this week, so I'm terrified. Ooh, two little monsters. Yeah, going from one to two. Not the easiest. As someone who has done it, it's. 430 and it's still dark. It counts. Okay, whatever. Back up. I guess west coast is a little less egregious.

00:17:29
<transcript>: but

00:17:36
<transcript>: But 430, man, I said till 1030 to watch the Super bowl, like, 1030 my time. It was brutal.

00:17:36
<transcript>: i was dead

00:17:38
<transcript>: I was dead to the world yesterday.

00:17:38
<transcript>: and

00:17:40
<transcript>: And that was 1030.

00:17:40
<transcript>: i

00:17:42
<transcript>: I go to bed at 830.

00:17:42
<transcript>: that was two hours

00:17:44
<transcript>: That was 2 hours late for me.

00:17:48
badcop_: 10:30 is rookie numbers

00:17:57
<transcript>: All right, I'm going to get to work, and you guys can watch me, and I'll interact some on my working, but I am trying to be a little more focused. I want this to be sustainable. I want to build a stream.

00:17:57
<transcript>: and get

00:18:10
<transcript>: And get work done. Two things at the same time. It's going to be tough, but. We're going to try it. If I can do that, I think I can stream consistently. Maybe for a whole year. We'll see. I should maybe stick with a month. Let's. Just go for a month.

00:18:19
<transcript>: But I'm going to go for a walk at some point this morning when it warms. Up just a little bit because it did snow, like, six inches yesterday.

00:18:19
<transcript>: and for

00:18:21
<transcript>: And for all of you, because.

00:18:21
<transcript>: you're probably

00:18:29
<transcript>: How many centimeters is six inches?

00:18:32
<transcript>: It's like a banana length.

<transcript>: Irl streams in the ozark. Let's go. That's right. So we're. Going to go for a walk, and I'm going to take you on a walk. Because I have an IRL streaming rig now, and I'm going to take it to my workout today, and I'm going to take it to my tournament this weekend.

<transcript>: He is the antithesis of that, but also, like the antidote to my overly that does that make sense? He's the antithesis of me, and it makes me uncomfortable, but I. Love it. I love being around him. For that reason, I still remember nearly every line of Ken's. Episode was prime, like, three years ago or something. That man's member of. Yeah. He is memorable. He is 100%.

00:20:13
<transcript>: I so wonder if my little segments work. I don't have my third camera plugged. In right now because it's my IRL camera now, so I don't have like the moving around the office camera. That's the one that I think.

00:20:13
<transcript>: it cut

00:20:22
<transcript>: It cut to when we did the segments. You guys don't care. No one even knows. What I'm talking about with segments. I'm stuck on something no one cares about. Okay.

00:20:27
<transcript>: Let's see. This is what I'm working on today.

00:20:29
<transcript>: I need to hit this button.

00:20:29

00:23:22
<transcript>: we do

00:23:27
<transcript>: We do still have elixir running in production, but the website is no longer electric.

00:23:35
<transcript>: It was an Elixir Phoenix app.

00:23:41
<transcript>: And we're mostly moving away from elixir just because we don't have electric experience on the team.

00:23:46
<transcript>: Like our team is much more JavaScript.

00:23:47
naxodev: sup

00:23:49
<transcript>: In terms of our skill set.

00:23:50
<transcript>: So.

00:23:50
<transcript>: we're moving away

00:23:54
texoport: *chomps into larabar* sponsorship when?

00:23:54
<transcript>: We're moving away from it. What's up, Naxodv?

00:23:58
<transcript>: Okay, so this is a page.

00:23:58
<transcript>: need a seymour

00:24:00
<transcript>: Need a seymour button.

00:24:00
<transcript>: i'm going to go fuzzy

00:24:01
<transcript>: I'm going to go fuzzy for a second.

00:24:05
<transcript>: I got to look at the mock.

00:24:08
<transcript>: Where is the.

00:24:08
<transcript>: mock

00:24:09
<transcript>: Mock.

00:24:12
<transcript>: Where is the mock?

00:24:25
<transcript>: Oh, there we go. Found it.

00:24:27
<transcript>: Okay.

00:24:27
<transcript>: so

00:24:30
<transcript>: So this has got a little show. More with a little carrot.

00:24:30
<transcript>: that's going to be

00:24:32
<transcript>: That's going to be a link.

00:24:34
<transcript>: Okay.

00:24:37
<transcript>: So we're going to show five.

00:24:39
<transcript>: We're going to say leagues.

00:24:43
<transcript>: Oh, I can. Unfuzzy. Sorry.

00:24:45
<transcript>: Slice.

00:24:47
<transcript>: Five like that.

00:24:51
<transcript>: Right. Is it slice. Yeah.

00:24:54
<transcript>: No, not there. That's the wrong spot.

00:24:56
<transcript>: Down here.

00:24:58
<transcript>: Queries, okay?

00:25:06
<transcript>: Oh, I'm already doing just the top ten. Now I need to just make that five.

00:25:11
<transcript>: Well, that means I've probably got ten down here. Yeah.

00:25:19
<transcript>: Look at that.

00:25:28
<transcript>: Look at that. I should probably make a component for that because it's all over the place. Okay, let's save that. So now we should only be showing five? Yeah.

00:25:33
<transcript>: Let's go. Mobile view, so I can save a little space here.

00:25:39
<transcript>: Okay, so we show five, and then we're going to have a little, like, show more. Thing at the bottom.

00:25:48
<transcript>: I really should make it as a component, shouldn't I? It's a little different. For the teams versus the players. The teams have multiple images.

00:25:48
<transcript>: how

00:25:51
<transcript>: How do I want to handle that?

00:26:02
<transcript>: I'm going to be eating breakfast.

00:26:07
<transcript>: And I need to trim my beard.

00:26:07
<transcript>: and i've got

00:26:13
<transcript>: And I've got this close up camera on my face. There's going to be food in my mustache. Just heads up.

00:26:16
<transcript>: Can't avoid it.

00:26:21
<transcript>: But I'm going to rub my mouth constantly to make sure I get it off.

00:26:21
<transcript>: chompson

00:26:29
<transcript>: Chompson delar bar sponsorship win. Yeah, no kidding. Win Larbar. When do I get a sponsorship because, like, I've earned it.

00:26:32
<transcript>: Okay.

00:26:39
<transcript>: Right here. So this is all the items, the list. Okay. And then below this list.

00:26:43
<transcript>: I guess down here.

00:26:46
<transcript>: H three, all that stuff.

00:26:46
<transcript>: and then

00:26:52
<transcript>: And then show more. Well, no, we only want to show more if there is a list, so. This is the empty state when there's no data.

00:26:54
<transcript>: But kind of better right here.

00:27:01
<transcript>: This is one of those, like, can't have more than one child thing.

00:27:01
<transcript>: just not

00:27:04
<transcript>: Just not going to work because I have the ol there. I don't know. Let's see.

00:27:09
<transcript>: Seymour.

00:27:15
<transcript>: It worked.

00:27:18
<transcript>: It looks terrible.

00:27:21
<transcript>: Okay, text center.

00:27:28
<transcript>: Let's put a little padding.

00:27:32
<transcript>: Padding. Just the y. Padding. Three.

00:27:35
<transcript>: Let's say.

00:27:35
<transcript>: i

00:27:37
<transcript>: I need that chevron.

00:27:40
<transcript>: Where is that chevron?

00:27:42
fragaverage: YO WTF WHO IS THIS

00:27:46
<transcript>: Need to look at the mock again.

00:27:46
<transcript>: fuzzy

00:27:48
<transcript>: Fuzzy.

00:27:55
<transcript>: Yeah, that's good. Show more with a chevron, but it's kind of like. A gray color.

00:27:59
<transcript>: It's not.

00:28:01
<transcript>: Text.

00:28:01
<transcript>: gray

00:28:03
<transcript>: Gray.

00:28:10
<transcript>: Oh, no.

00:28:15
<transcript>: There we go. That looks good.

00:28:25
<transcript>: An arrow down. What is happening? Oh, you guys. Frag, frag, frag, frag is. Here. Frag you would not believe.

00:28:25
<transcript>: how much

00:28:29
<transcript>: How much I've talked about you in my two streams. Seven back.

00:28:29
<transcript>: i

00:28:31
<transcript>: I did a whole.

00:28:40
<transcript>: Like is the word when you're, when you're not, like, not the beginning of a thing. That's a monologue. Or maybe that's not a monologue. Maybe. That just means one person. I did.

00:28:40
<transcript>: i called

00:28:47
fragaverage: I got my own segment?

00:28:49
joshuajebaraj: Hey Adam

00:28:49
<transcript>: I called it an epilogue. It was like the ending of my stream yesterday was all about Frag. And how I missed frag and where was frag? And it's not the same without frag here.

00:28:57
<transcript>: You should check it out. Check out the vod. You got your own segment. Yeah, what's? Up, Joshua? How you been? Frag?

00:28:57
<transcript>: how you been

00:28:59
<transcript>: How you been?

00:29:01
<transcript>: This is going to be a hyperlink.

00:29:05
<transcript>: So let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do.

00:29:05
<transcript>: hyperlink

00:29:06
<transcript>: Hyperlink.

00:29:08
<transcript>: I don't know yet.

00:29:14
<transcript>: See more.

00:29:21
<transcript>: And I guess that hyperlink. Well, the hyperlink itself have the chevron in it, yeah. Why not?

00:29:24
<transcript>: Chevron.

00:29:24
<transcript>: oh no

00:29:28
<transcript>: Oh, no, that's a spilt component.

00:29:30
<transcript>: So that's something nobody talks about.

00:29:36
<transcript>: Nobody talks about how it's painful when you're mixing.

00:29:36
<transcript>: these server

00:29:36
joshuajebaraj: Your video quality is 🤯 , which camera is btw

00:29:38
<transcript>: These server side.

00:29:38
<transcript>: and

00:29:42
<transcript>: And client side libraries like in Astro, you can just drop an island.

00:29:42
<transcript>: like

00:29:53
<transcript>: Like a client side island on your page, and that island is hydrated and handled like the runtime is streamed. Whatever. Astro does all the things to make that work.

00:30:13
<transcript>: But what they don't talk about is in your code base. When you have a mix. Of server rendered stuff and client side rendered stuff in two different technologies. Like, I have a bunch of astral components, and I have a bunch of felt components. And the problem is now I need icons for both. I need icons on the server side and I need icons on the client. Side because I can't. In a spelt component, I can't import an.

00:30:13
<transcript>: astro

00:30:25
<transcript>: Astro component. So if I make all my icons in Astro, they're just svgs. They're just svgs. But you know how you want to have, like, a nice component? You. Just import and you drop it there and it looks good.

00:30:28
<transcript>: You can't really do that in this model.

00:30:28
<transcript>: not

00:30:30
fragaverage: I am pretty good, life has thrown us a curveball for the early part of 2024, but we're handling it 😂 How is being beaten up by other dude in white robes?

00:30:30
<transcript>: Not well.

00:30:30
<transcript>: i

00:30:30
joshuajebaraj: NVM looked at the FAQ

00:30:38
<transcript>: I need a solution for that. Joshua. Video quality is head exploding. Which camera it's in? Sony a seven s three.

00:30:46
<transcript>: I'm pretty good. Life has thrown us a curve off the early product launch war. We're handling it. How is being beaten up by the other dude in white robes?

00:30:54
<transcript>: Jiu jitsu has been an excellent. I love it. I love it so much.

00:30:58
<transcript>: I've got tormit. This weekend, the Missouri state championship.

00:31:05
<transcript>: Okay, so this is the svg. It's just an svg, so.

00:31:05
<transcript>: i could just

00:31:06
<transcript>: I could just.

00:31:06
<transcript>: create an

00:31:08
fragaverage: Please take water this time, thanks

00:31:10
<transcript>: Create an asteroid. This just feels bad. If I have a chevron.

00:31:17
<transcript>: Astro and a chevron stealth. Feels bad, man. Feels real bad.

00:31:21
<transcript>: But what are you going to do?

00:31:24
<transcript>: I don't know what I'm going to do about it.

00:31:32
vinci__g: awesome follow alert damn

00:31:32
<transcript>: What was that? Did somebody follow or something? Vincey. Sorry I said that so dismissively, I. Mean, did somebody follow?

00:31:36
<transcript>: Vincey, thanks so much for the follow.

00:31:40
<transcript>: Please take water this time. Thanks. Yeah.

00:31:40
<transcript>: i'll be

00:31:43
<transcript>: I'll be well hydrated.

00:31:51
<transcript>: That was not the best that last tournament. Let's see. Astro, props, I just want to. Make sure to spread astro.

00:31:57
<transcript>: Props in there, right? I don't need to do anything up here. Well, I guess I could. For typescript, I could say.

00:32:00
<transcript>: Interface props.

00:32:03
<transcript>: Extend.

00:32:07
<transcript>: Extend. Yeah. That nod? No, not that.

00:32:07
<transcript>: not

00:32:09
<transcript>: Not react.

00:32:14
<transcript>: It's just like HTML element or something. What is it?

00:32:14
<transcript>: ht

00:32:17
<transcript>: HTML attribute.

00:32:23
<transcript>: What's the. What's the. No, not from. React. What is it from?

00:32:27
<transcript>: Astro attributes.

00:32:31
<transcript>: There it is.

00:32:31
<transcript>: ht

00:32:34
<transcript>: HTML attributes. Wait.

00:32:39
<transcript>: Oh, and then you can just pass a tag. Yeah.

00:32:43
<transcript>: Love it.

00:32:46
<transcript>: HTML.

00:32:48
<transcript>: Attribute.

00:32:51
<transcript>: Sv.

00:32:51
<transcript>: sv

00:32:52
<transcript>: Svg.

00:32:52
<transcript>: win

00:32:54
joshuajebaraj: Adam not sure if you remember that once you shared the excel sheets consist of how much you made in that year, I took a copy of that and using that as my motivation/inspiration <3

00:32:55
<transcript>: Winning, winning.

00:32:59
<transcript>: So then I can just spread props right there, right?

00:33:02
<transcript>: Okay.

00:33:06
<transcript>: All. That looks good.

00:33:13
<transcript>: Now I can import my chevron. My second chevron component feels good.

00:33:16
<transcript>: That was being sarcastic.

00:33:18
<transcript>: Chevron.

00:33:22
<transcript>: And then I'm going to import it from.

00:33:26
<transcript>: No. What? Not that one.

00:33:26
<transcript>: i'm going to

00:33:30
<transcript>: I'm going to go up and fix it. Where is it?

00:33:40
<transcript>: Been funny if, after all that, if I just looked up and realized, oh, wait, I'm. In an assault component.

00:33:43
<transcript>: Component.

00:33:46
<transcript>: Icons, okay?

00:33:54
<transcript>: Move these guys up here. They belong with their little family of components.

00:33:56
<transcript>: Okay.

00:33:56
<transcript>: let

00:34:00
<transcript>: Let's see. Where am I at? Seymour chevron.

00:34:00
<transcript>: boom

00:34:02
<transcript>: Boom.

00:34:05
<transcript>: I need to style that. Let's see.

00:34:18
<transcript>: Adam. Not sure if you remember that once you shared the excel sheets consists of how much you made in that year. I took a copy of that and using that as my motivation inspiration. Josh but that is awesome. I do remember that I did a twitter space, I believe.

00:34:21
<transcript>: Kind of went through a bunch of stuff.

00:34:25
<transcript>: We did it.

00:34:29
<transcript>: We did it. It's a chevron.

00:34:32
<transcript>: That's funny.

00:34:38
<transcript>: I think we're done here. Our work here is done.

00:34:42
<transcript>: This is why I passed all the props in.

00:34:42
<transcript>: if i can do like

00:34:43
<transcript>: If I can do like this.

00:34:55
<transcript>: Oh. Need to flex.

00:35:08
<transcript>: So text center is not going to work. We need to do.

00:50:31
ricardoatds: mind if I ask what are we working on today ?

00:51:31

00:55:49
uberrick: @OetziOfficial what do you use kobalte for, other components that shadcn doesn't have?

00:56:40
hmida74: I keep writing "jkjkjkj" in chat and like WHY IS VIM NOT WORKING

00:56:48
oetziofficial: @OetziOfficial well, I use a solidjs port of shadcn. it even has less than shadcn components at the moment

01:08:37
oetziofficial: that was months ago @adamdotdev

01:08:52
trivenge: its really one of, if not, the only protein powder to get as a vegetarian/vegan for sure

01:09:00
pbertrand_dev: pee protein?

01:09:06
trivenge: mainly because of comparable studies to it and whey protein

01:09:21
pbertrand_dev: adams on the vegan juice

01:09:24
trivenge: but you definitely want to look into that more in your spare time, definitely nice to have, popular in our vegan community

01:09:44
trivenge: LUL

01:09:46
pbertrand_dev: hes a 100% enhanced

01:10:05
trivenge: no juice involved, 100% natural lol. im actually surprised he answered that LUL

01:13:51
trivenge: when is statmuse gonna work with mrbeast?

01:13:54
fragaverage: Write a transform function and start modeling how you want it

01:14:13
pbertrand_dev: @FragAverage m2 air is still nice

01:15:12
pbertrand_dev: "I'm going to stream every tuesday this week I think"

01:15:19
fragaverage: I meant a transform function to run as part of a deploy CICD pipeline

01:15:28
fragaverage: to transform the existing data to the new model

01:15:43
trivenge: lol

01:17:35

trivenge: did statmuse advertise at superbowl?

01:19:05
trivenge: i missed the superbowl went to bed early

01:19:31
naerok_gg: i used to work at a similar (idk if its the same concept) company with sports stats -> odds, i knew nothing about sports and still dont

01:19:40
estrangedhd: @triveNge They got Disney/Google funding, but not that kind of funding

01:20:12
trivenge: how much were ads at the superbowl?

01:20:41
sebaxpdev: Question, why not using a file exclusively for constant? Or is better performance wise declare them locally in the same file?

01:20:49
peculiarnewbie: It was all ads basically

01:21:00
estrangedhd: @triveNge 30sec costs around 7mil

01:31:45
fragaverage: KEKW remember this?

01:32:02
sebaxpdev: Did you or someone created a design system for the app?

01:32:13
peculiarnewbie: Did you start streaming again just so that you can rebrand to adamdottv because you couldn't get adamdotdev on github?

01:32:13
sebaxpdev: Or you are going with the flow

01:32:17
sebaxpdev: Yeap statmuse

01:32:49

01:32:54

01:36:26
bronifty: nft are made for this and art generally

01:36:30
rihan_s_: don't need to sell the handle, just pay for the action of transferring ownership. msft still owns the handle.

01:36:49
bronifty: the art of money laundering

01:37:59
sebaxpdev: @bronifty is that an Ozarks thing... LUL LUL LUL

01:38:28
fragaverage: sent a DM on discord with a possible method

01:40:27

01:40:57
sebaxpdev: Have you tried image-set ?? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image/image-set

01:41:21

kaceynotdev: I have infinite Adam bucks

02:13:09
ae517: @funkysetiz It consumes some of the initial RAM (bloat stuff and other things), but I don't recommend relying on Windows itself, so I think it's better to setup an WSL. At least from my point of view.

02:13:22
warrenbuffering: I'm very hinged don't worry

02:13:52
warrenbuffering: why stock market go down?

02:16:52
ae517: @funkysetiz I mean you can do a turn around and disable all bloat, at least on Windows 10, and the disable updates, so they are not reactivated, because Windows hates it's users, the same way Apples parasites it's coonsumers.

02:17:18
ae517: But yeah, for Linux is like Heaven on earth,

02:17:21

05:03:24
astrodev3: what’s your advice on structuring your applications? everyone seem to have different ways

05:03:50

bulowking: So, Fatty Tuesday is once per year when you eat a Semla, to prepare for the fasting, that I don't do.

05:06:07
next_door_nate: Set it to 100% at the bottom or center it

arkansassnowman: well wait nvm

05:19:12
arkansassnowman: i may be dumb dont listen to me

05:19:47
arkansassnowman: i didnt see you were using typescript

05:20:19
oetziofficial: is Astro not allowing `as const`?

05:20:41
pbertrand_dev: adam I just finished my workout, help me decide what I eat

05:21:16
arkansassnowman: what is on line 109?

05:21:17
oetziofficial: what was the error again?

05:21:22
pbertrand_dev: I am an omnivore

05:21:46
pbertrand_dev: I eat vegan somedays

05:21:56
pbertrand_dev: I had vegan lebanese food the otehr day

05:21:58
pbertrand_dev: was legendary

05:22:00
superricksanchez: emum maybe?

05:22:12
m2devdotnet: try it as a 'inline union'?

05:22:23
m2devdotnet: category: 'searches' | 'other_thing'

05:23:18
pbertrand_dev: oh side note I need like 2500 calories in this meal

05:23:51
superricksanchez: make the category as enums, and then you can export it.. i think..

05:24:07
pbertrand_dev: I am usually around 120g - 160 g protein per day

05:24:29
superricksanchez: ahh gat ya

oetziofficial: use j k

05:26:17
oetziofficial: and u to update

05:26:49
arkansassnowman: update everything and lets work through the fallout

05:28:10
kylel2p: d.ts?

05:28:37
fragaverage: global.d.ts

05:28:38
joyquery: types.d.ts

05:28:42
kylel2p: not sure convention

05:28:43
superricksanchez: global.d.ts

05:31:19
fragaverage: maybe its globals

05:31:45
joyquery: u can add to tsconfig json as types location

05:31:55
joyquery: and should make it global without importing everywhere

05:31:58
fragaverage: oh types.d.ts, my bad

05:33:01
joyquery: in the tsconfig there is a "typeRoots" prop i usually add it there as a path to that file

05:34:51
superricksanchez: thats the programmer way, trial and error

05:35:04
zachrip: typeroots goes in compiler options

05:35:16
joyquery: should be under compilerOptions

05:35:25
joyquery: yah thats correct

05:35:37
zachrip: sorry I just got here, what are you trying to do?

05:36:01
superricksanchez: from the docs it didnt say you need the d.ts

05:36:25
superricksanchez: no no,  https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#typeRoots

05:36:25
zachrip: you can use your d.ts but I would just add that to your includes instead of using typeroots

05:36:46
pudottapommin: you use ... declare global { ...things ... }

05:36:50
superricksanchez: from the docs:  {   "compilerOptions": {     "typeRoots": ["./typings", "./vendor/types"]   } }

05:37:01
xtremeskills007: is that your keyboard or some artifical click sounds?

05:37:40
zachrip: yeah but you'll need to include all your other stuff

05:37:50
joyquery: make sure when u make changes to tsconfig reload ur project in case

05:38:10
joyquery: haha i like it

05:39:08
ayushsharma: do you giveaway the baseline macbook ?

05:39:09
stricegaming: @adamdotdev face too big

05:39:47
stricegaming: for the screen i mean, you dont look fat xD

05:39:50
xtremeskills007: bruh you look buff af

05:39:54
xtremeskills007: how much do you bench?

05:39:54
stricegaming: thanks man following

05:39:57
arkansassnowman: face is fine

05:40:06
arkansassnowman: wanna give kisses

05:40:10
texoport: :D

05:40:32
pudottapommin: are you sitting straight? monkaS

05:41:15
pudottapommin: you are slightly to the side LUL on camera

05:41:51
neverendingnewness: omg those tabs

05:42:04
superricksanchez: curious why astro?

05:42:12
joyquery: if u dont have 50 tabs open are u even programming haha

05:42:33
stricegaming: @joyQuery at least 50, thats bare minimum

05:42:43
neverendingnewness: @joyQuery I have like 5 desktops going... am I doing it wrong?

05:42:44
dcap_: what is tabs, there is only spaces Kappa

05:43:18
joyquery: @neverendingnewness thats fine as long as you have 50 tabs open on each

05:44:24
arkansassnowman: I am trying to get more simple at work and want to migrate backwards to web 1.0 tech.

05:44:26
dcap_: What league is money?

05:44:49
allamgr: crypto

05:45:13
superricksanchez: how long have you been using vim?

05:45:46
stricegaming: @adamdotdev does statsmuse make money? i dont see pricing anywhere. i just want to have an idea of how these types of apps work

05:45:59
arkansassnowman: year before

05:46:37
superricksanchez: how long did it take you to not think of the commands to move around? im still in VScode, thinking of moving to vim

05:46:50
stricegaming: ahhhh thats explains it, im running uBlock

05:46:58
neverendingnewness: I coded in neovim years ago but found myself farting around with it more than actually coding. I don't feel like I'm losing any time using VS Code. It's weird to see the vim resurgence.

05:49:38
superricksanchez: @neverendingnewness huh, i might be the same when i try moving lol, is there some kind of graphical cheatsheet?

05:50:06
stricegaming: that was a cool animation

05:50:35
dnbull: noice

05:51:17
neverendingnewness: @superricksanchez I mean there are cheat sheets out there, but the whole process of setting up linting / syntax highlighting is a PIA. Just stick with VS Code. Learning vim for quick edits, is a good idea, but you only need to know a handful of commands.

05:51:18
superricksanchez: lol atleast you started, im telling my self to do it for years

05:51:24
dnbull: i think people who make fun of people who can't "lift" dont workout themselves tbh LUL
