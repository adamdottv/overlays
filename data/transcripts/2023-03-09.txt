12:25:23
<transcript>: David. Yeah, I made an autozoom thing. Obviously, I just turned it off. It was supposed to only. And yesterday it worked pretty good. It's only supposed to like, when my face makes drastic expressions. Today it was apparently the opposite. It decided today, the more neutral my face, the more it should Zoom. And when I make silly faces, no, don't Zoom in on that. So I don't know why.

12:25:23
<transcript>: but it's broken

12:25:24
<transcript>: But it's broken.

alexkates: it just feels wrong writing scan operations

12:26:24
desu_is_sparta: I love that Django generates all the migrations for you

12:26:25
<transcript>: There's like, all these migration sequel things. And I just thought, like, Man, I love dynamo because I don't have to write migration scripts. And then I remembered, oh, I do it's just like, I write them in typescript, and they're not. There's no, like, rhymer reason, just like, one off, I'm gonna migrate all this stuff.

12:26:34

<transcript>: My studio is giving you anxiety.

<transcript>: i mean

12:28:05
salkinvonbach: Reminds me I gotta ship some servers

12:28:06

12:28:06
<transcript>: you build

12:28:13
<transcript>: You build stuff modern serverless stuff probably want to use that you'll use 50 though.

12:28:17
<transcript>: You could buy like a domain or something and use credit that way.

12:28:19
<transcript>: I think.

12:28:22
<transcript>: More than one entry cafe.

12:28:28
<transcript>: I think we'll do the thing where you spend channel points to get entries.

12:28:34
<transcript>: Give me 100% ownership of stagnese.

12:29:12
<transcript>: that means

12:29:16
<transcript>: That means we're doing things. We're going places to the moon, even.

<transcript>: I forget that ads are. I do the twitch turbo thing, so I never see ads on twitch. And I forget that some people see ads on twitch. I'm sorry about that. I wish I could. Can I do something about it? I actually don't even know. I think I used to know and I don't know anymore.

12:43:46
<transcript>: Alex. So it's Fig plus. Aws, cli is a super pair. Oh, you use fig.

<transcript>: Interesting rudics.

12:44:17
<transcript>: Yeah, I guess it could.

12:44:28
<transcript>: I don't know if dax joins. Well, he's smarter. He does smart things on rebates, and we can ask him if there's any reason we can't do that. I guess the only problem would be if you change your github username or something.

12:50:04
<transcript>: Okay. Let's go to giveaways.

12:50:06
<transcript>: Giveaway.

12:50:11
<transcript>: And there should be like a point. Let's see.

12:50:18
<transcript>: Oh, you know what? It's actually here. I can just change the cost right here. We'll just make it cost.

12:50:24
<transcript>: Ten points per entry. You can do four Max.

12:50:31
<transcript>: Or or we're doing 20 today. So how would I make it? Where if you have a thousand channel point.

12:50:31
<transcript>: you could get

12:50:34
<transcript>: You could get the maximum effect today.

12:50:37
<transcript>: So if there's 20.

12:50:40
<transcript>: That means you'd spend 50.

12:50:45
<transcript>: 50 points per round.

12:50:45
<transcript>: and if we

12:50:50
<transcript>: And if we want to say you have multiple entries, let's just say not multiple entries today. Let's just say you.

12:51:02
<transcript>: Spend 50 Channel Points. You get an entry into each round under 20 rounds.

12:51:02
<transcript>: you got twenty

12:51:04
<transcript>: You got 20 chances at winning.

12:51:06
<transcript>: A $50.

<transcript>: Aws Promotional credit.

12:51:09

12:51:12
<transcript>: user ma

12:51:18
<transcript>: User Max. Wait, no, no. User Max would mean, oh, that doesn't work.

12:51:21
greenshoesbrownsocks: username === 'greenshoesbrownsocks' ? giftAllPoints ? giftAllPoints

12:51:25
<transcript>: Okay, here we go. This is kind of fun. User Max is 20 so you could send.

12:51:33
<transcript>: You can spend all your 20 entries on the first one, or you could spread them out over the 20 rounds, right.

12:51:33
<transcript>: that's kind of cool

12:51:35
<transcript>: That's kind of cool.

12:51:35
<transcript>: kind of

12:51:37
thdxr: in here

12:51:38
<transcript>: Kind of fun. I think that's kind of fun.

binajmen: which audio headset are you using?

12:55:06
<transcript>: It's a lot of redeeming people. Okay. So remember, you could redeem this a lot of times, but you can only redeem it 20 times in this stream, and I'm giving away 20 separate rounds, so you don't want to spin them all at once. If you want to spread out your giveaway entry or entrance.

12:55:06
<transcript>: entries

12:55:15
schrew: But there might be more people here later!!!

12:55:15
lilfreezi: ALL OR NOTHING BABY

12:55:17
<transcript>: Entries. You might want to spread them out. You might want to save some for the next round. Okay, I'm just telling everybody you can only do 20 today. Dax, did you hear the rules? Did everyone even hear the roles? Did I explain the rules.

12:55:25
mehulsharmamat: people are playing their own game lol

12:55:25
<transcript>: I feel like everyone's redeeming a lot. And the next round, no one's gonna have points or no one's gonna be able to redeem because you don't have.

12:55:25
<transcript>: you've used your

12:55:27
blakegreendev: Going all in on the first one! Yolo!

12:55:31
<transcript>: You've used your 20 entries. You know, I'm saying, this is just for $50 people. This is not the one.

12:55:33
<transcript>: Oh, my goodness.

12:55:51
brianhhough: $50 to build the next FAANG company u never know

mehulsharmamat: @binajmen me and you

12:56:02
mehulsharmamat: this is like squid game rn lol

12:56:04
<transcript>: There will be 19 more rounds. Okay, you're playing the probability game. Well, I think everyone's not playing the probability game because everyone's throwing in all their chips at the same time. So you're all just getting diluted. If you saved it for like, round 20, no one will have any redemptions left. And then probabilities are definitely in your favor. Okay, now that I've explained math and prob.

12:56:04
<transcript>: probabilities

12:56:08
<transcript>: Probabilities. So the best of my ability, this is like squid Gaming right now.

13:00:07
<transcript>: Like I've got everything pulled up, I've got it all running again, which is quite a feat, by the way.

13:00:07

13:00:25
<transcript>: rick athlete

13:00:35
<transcript>: Rick Athlete video to ibs so I can test with it while I'm building because I'm streaming on twitch. I can't really use my own stream. So this is the thing that's being streamed to rebase right now.

13:00:40
<transcript>: Yeah, my machine is doing a lot. I'm kind of surprised it's still standing.

13:00:42
<transcript>: Should have probably fallen over by now.

13:00:51
<transcript>: Okay, but I haven't pulled down your changes because I just want to make sure I get all this working.

13:00:57
<transcript>: With the fake video. And now I'm terrified. I'm terrified.

13:00:57
<transcript>: but i guess

13:01:04
<transcript>: But I guess I'll pull it down. Dax, you're here. You're here. So you can help me if everything breaks when I pull it down. Alright.

13:01:04
<transcript>: you confirm

13:01:06
<transcript>: You confirm or deny.

13:01:13
thdxr: sure!

<transcript>: And let's here we go. I'm gonna pull it down. Sure. Okay.

13:01:22
<transcript>: I've got all my changes stage does that mean I can do get pull rebates.

13:01:30
<transcript>: No, I have to commit or stash them okay feels bad when everything's running to do get stashed but.

13:01:33
<transcript>: I guess such as life.

13:01:38
<transcript>: Do I want to do this? It's gonna get rid of the video file. Everything's gonna break.

13:01:41
thdxr: commit

13:01:41
<transcript>: Maybe I'll just do this. Let's actually.

13:01:41
<transcript>: on

13:01:44
thdxr: then rebase

13:01:47
<transcript>: On purpose break every thing so I can feel a little better that everything's shut down.

13:01:47
<transcript>: let's shut it all

13:01:49
<transcript>: Let's shut it all down.

13:01:51
<transcript>: It's all shutting down.

<transcript>: We'll do that.

13:02:00
<transcript>: Get.

13:02:04
mehulsharmamat: i never touch prod after it's working - probably why my products dont get more than 1 user

<transcript>: I just don't even know what to say here. Animation progress.

13:02:17
<transcript>: Yeah, we got to get this on dev. That's what we're gonna do, right? So that we could get off my stupid branch.

13:02:19
<transcript>: Okay.

13:02:22
<transcript>: Get push no, I need to do get.

13:02:22
<transcript>: pull

13:02:27

binajmen: which audio headset do you have? it looks way more comfy than my beats..

13:03:20
eddyvinck: Doing alright, have a day off

13:03:27
<transcript>: Hey, somebody tell me, welcome to Chad, Eddie. Probably six those easily. I'm gonna fix the the twos that are easy, but the pmpm lock is there like a command where I can just be like, I want to take his version of pmp unlock. Isn't there just a way to do that.

13:03:30
<transcript>: Like if I said.

13:03:36
thdxr: run pnpm install and it'll fix it

13:03:44
<transcript>: Filters a get command for that. It's doing all right. Having a day off? Ooh, days off are always good. Which audio headset do you have? It looks way more comfy than My Beats is very comfy. These are Sethes or sinhizer.

13:04:23
<transcript>: Okay.

13:04:25
<transcript>: What did I ask.

13:05:11
<transcript>: Hit. Check out theirs. Merge it all.

13:05:16
<transcript>: This is fun Twitch chat helping me get through some get stuff.

13:05:18
<transcript>: What could go wrong.

13:05:18
<transcript>: so you have

13:05:47
thdxr: I think should just update to latest sst after you pull everything down

13:05:54
<transcript>: Upload the drawbox in the flow with ftp, I think should just update the latest sstf after you pull everything down okay.

13:05:54
<transcript>: let's go

<transcript>: let's

13:07:48
<transcript>: Let's.

13:07:54
<transcript>: See another pmpm install? Because I don't know what it just did. I have no idea what it did.

13:08:04
<transcript>: I have no idea if the file had all the merge stuff in it. What did it install on my machine? And why did it not complain? It says everything's up to date.

13:08:07
<transcript>: I don't know how that's true.

13:08:07
<transcript>: okay so

13:08:09
<transcript>: Okay. So we're gonna add.

13:08:09
<transcript>: all

13:08:11
<transcript>: All of it. I guess.

13:08:17
<transcript>: I feel like the lock file might be kind of weird right now. Let's just look at the lock file.

13:08:19
brianhhough: @adamdotdev listening to u stream is so relaxing while i'm coding LOL @mehulsharmamat is right!

13:08:27
<transcript>: Let's search for the arrow. No. Okay. So it results. Okay.

13:08:37
<transcript>: Get rebase.

13:08:37

eddyvinck: I wish I was cool enough to use Vim

13:08:57
<transcript>: Okay. I'm gonna push now. Dax.

13:08:58
oetziofficial: kruzWave

13:08:59
<transcript>: Push.

13:09:02
eddyvinck: That’s neovim right?

13:09:06
<transcript>: Okay, let's see my team's are minimal. I've been waiting on rtc things recently and hearing trpc is breaking my brand.

13:09:08
mehulsharmamat: @eddyvinck you are! it's super easy

13:09:12
<transcript>: Okay.

13:09:17
<transcript>: Brian the most capable. Thank you so much.

13:09:34
mehulsharmamat: woaaah

13:09:37
<transcript>: May hold this stream is so chill. I love it. Gonna hit the gym and come back if you're still on have fun, everyone. That sounds great, man. Who? I can't wait to see you again. Just so you know, dax, listen to me while he works out at the gym. Just a little tip. I want to try it. I don't know. I don't feel like I'd be good for, like, trying to get a pump. Like my voice. I think prime. You catch a prime stream while you're working out.

13:09:37
<transcript>: that probably helps

13:09:38
<transcript>: That probably helps.

13:09:38
<transcript>: like that make you

13:09:44
<transcript>: Like that make you just want, you know, blow something up, push something out of the gym.

13:09:44
<transcript>: but when i'm

13:09:47
<transcript>: But when I'm hanging out, it's probably not as exciting.

13:09:47
<transcript>: it's a little more chill

13:09:49
<transcript>: It's a little more chill.

13:09:54
<transcript>: Wish I was cool enough to use them. Everyone's cool enough. Eddie? I just started.

13:09:54
<transcript>: it is neove

13:10:10
<transcript>: It is neovem. I just started using Neil them. I had never used them. I mean aside from like sshing into some machine having to use V or something. I didn't know the venmovements at all like six months ago. I just started while on twitch. In fact I think start streaming Eddie, if you don't already and then.

13:10:20
<transcript>: And then learn Neil them on twitch. You'll get the most helpful people ever that come in and just tell you how to do stuff. I learned the vim, motions.

13:10:20
<transcript>: through twitch

13:10:25
eddyvinck: I’ve used the Vim extension for VSCode for a bit, it’s pretty fun

13:10:26
schrew: do you ever plan on using vim fugitive or similar within  nvim instead of regular git cli?

13:10:27
<transcript>: Through twitch chat. I think twitch Chat helped me accelerate my learning curve by like 200% because.

13:10:27
<transcript>: every time i did something

13:10:33
eddyvinck: Haha that’s good advice

13:10:36
<transcript>: Every time I did something done, they'd be like, stop hitting J and K so much. You can just do page up and page down. I still do J and K a lot much to their sugar in.

13:10:40
eddyvinck: Backseat coding lmao

13:10:44
<transcript>: Okay, let's see oh, etsy's here hey, OTSI.

13:10:45
stalwartcoder: Adam doesn’t need a gym, he is building muscles on git and vim XD

13:10:45
leanstein_: Hey haven't been here in a hot minute what project(s) are you working on right now?

13:10:50
fusionplays: i made myself not be able to disable the vscode vim plugin for a month, never switched back again

13:10:57
<transcript>: I've used the Vim Extent reviews cut for a bit. It's pretty fun. Yeah, I love it. I've actually loved all of it. The vim motions, the Neil Vim thing's just kind of a fun like tinkering and Community thing.

13:11:05
oetziofficial: I'm currently taking my break kruzComfy

13:11:10
<transcript>: But Vs. Code was Vin bindings. I think if I were going back to Vs. Code, I've learned so much about moving around a file and editing text more efficiently that I would take a lot of that with me. I would enjoy that experience as well.

13:11:10
<transcript>: do you ever

13:11:15
<transcript>: Do you ever plan on using Jim Fugesitive or similar within nvm instead of regular get cli.

13:11:15
<transcript>: i think

13:11:18
<transcript>: I think I've played with some of the git stuff.

13:11:18
<transcript>: and

13:11:20
daglee: Page up/page down? You can do ctrl-u/ctrl-d instead!

13:11:23
<transcript>: And I don't know. Maybe someone needs to sell it to me. Sell me on it.

13:11:28
neochromer: Whats the Theme you are using for the Terminal?

13:11:30
<transcript>: Stalwart. Adam doesn't need a gym. He's Billy muscles on github. That's right.

13:11:31
neochromer: P10K?

13:11:36
neochromer: I love the colors

13:11:40
<transcript>: Leinstein hey, haven't been here in a hot minute. What projects are you working on right now? Line sign. We're working on rebates TV. In fact, I will show you I haven't plugged it yet.

13:11:40
<transcript>: rebase

13:11:41
<transcript>: Rebase.

13:11:41
<transcript>: that tv

13:11:42
<transcript>: That TV.

13:11:51
<transcript>: It's a live game show for dead's, where you can win real cash prizes. Every time I say it, it gets a little more like infomercially.

13:12:06
<transcript>: But me and dax are building this dax's thxr if you didn't know me and dax are building rebates TV, it's gonna be a lot. It's like hqtrivia, but for devs, we'll do it like once a week, starting out. And then we'll see, we'll see how it goes.

13:12:14
<transcript>: And also welcome back Line stein. I have been here in a hot minute. I just started streaming again this week. It took a three month break, so I'm back.

13:12:14
<transcript>: fusion

13:12:24
<transcript>: Fusion Plays welcome to Chat. I made myself not be able to disable the Vs code bin plugin for a month. Never switch back again. Nice. So you forced yourself into it and then you stuck around.

13:12:33
stalwartcoder: I guess it’s P10k 🧐

13:12:37
oetziofficial: Does rebase got any sponsors?

13:12:39
<transcript>: Osci's taking his break. I think I'm taking your break, too. I don't know what this is. I'm so slow. Sorry, dax. Now I have dax, like, hanging out, watching me work on rebates and watching how slow I am. Oh, no. What happened? I tried to get push large files detected. Oh, no.

13:12:39
<transcript>: oh

13:12:41
<transcript>: Oh, I know what it is.

13:12:46
<transcript>: You know what? I should probably remove.

13:12:46
<transcript>: so

13:12:48
<transcript>: So, dax, I added a.

13:12:52
<transcript>: Test video. Where did I add that.

13:12:52
<transcript>: yes streams

13:12:59
<transcript>: Yes. Streams setting before it's. What that? If you saw this guy, the Rick Ashley video.

13:12:59
<transcript>: that frame

13:13:02
<transcript>: That frame. Look at that frame. What a perfect still.

13:13:02
<transcript>: that's

13:13:09
<transcript>: That's that's basically the summation of my Twitch streams right there. That right there.

13:13:12
<transcript>: That's basically what we've got accomplished so far.

13:13:16
schrew: Kreygasm

13:13:18
<transcript>: Yes. So I put that in there, but I should probably remove it.

13:13:18
<transcript>: you should probably not

13:13:20
<transcript>: You should probably not at it.

13:13:22
stalwartcoder: That’s after every merge conflict

13:13:24
<transcript>: Let's just do this. Let's do get removed.

13:13:26
<transcript>: Get removed.

13:13:27
stalwartcoder: That face*

13:13:32
thdxr: we're looking for sponsors!

13:13:34
<transcript>: No is get removed the way to do it. I don't want to delete the file you know should I get ignore it I could get ignore it.

13:13:36
overra_dev: successful deploy face

13:13:40
<transcript>: Should I get ignored? It. We're looking for sponsors. Yeah, we are P Ten K. Yeah, yeah, I use that. Oh, my zsh.

13:13:40
<transcript>: the theme

13:13:43
<transcript>: The theme you're using for the terminal is Dracula.

13:13:49
<transcript>: Control. U and control D. Yeah, that's what I meant. Begley. Sorry. I just. I was using, like the name of it.

13:13:49
<transcript>: but

13:13:52
<transcript>: But like I use control U, and control D.

13:13:59
<transcript>: Successful Deploy fit.

13:13:59
<transcript>: okay

13:14:00
<transcript>: Okay.

13:14:00
<transcript>: i need to

13:14:01
oetziofficial: Isn't the file in the commit?

13:14:10
thdxr: nah

13:14:13
<transcript>: I need to fix this. Dax, I don't want to add large files unless you want the file. Do you want the file? The files are already in the commit. So if I get ignore it. Can I remove it from git so that I can push anybody know it may smart.

13:14:13
<transcript>: need

13:14:17
<transcript>: Need someone smart? No, I don't want the file. Okay.

13:14:21
thdxr: the problem is it's in the git history now

13:14:24
stalwartcoder: You can add *.mp4 in gitignore but now just checkout the file

13:14:26
<transcript>: Then I need to get ignore it or get removed or move it it's in the get history now.

13:14:26
<transcript>: no i'll

13:14:31
<transcript>: No, I'll read. I'll fix it, I'll fix it, fix it. Hang on. People.

13:14:33
<transcript>: Okay.

13:14:36
<transcript>: We'll do this. We'll say, get amend.

13:14:36
<transcript>: is that the

13:14:37
thdxr: you should do a git reset and overwrite the commit

13:14:38
<transcript>: Is that the word.

13:14:38
<transcript>: amend

13:14:39
<transcript>: Amend.

13:14:39
<transcript>: and

13:14:43
<transcript>: And you should do a git reset an overwrite the commit.

13:14:43
<transcript>: reset set

13:14:45
<transcript>: Reset. Set, sounds.

13:14:45
<transcript>: scary

13:14:45
daglee: But you haven't commited it?

13:14:46
<transcript>: Scary.

13:14:47
schrew: ^^ reset is the one

13:14:52
<transcript>: I have committed it. Dagli. Reset. You want me to reset.

13:14:52
<transcript>: you're saying

13:14:56
<transcript>: You're saying, literally, just do gitreset. That sounds so scary.

13:14:58
<transcript>: Reset.

13:15:01
<transcript>: No.

13:15:01
<transcript>: but

13:15:04
thdxr: git log to get the commit

13:15:10
<transcript>: But first, before I do get reset, let's do another giveaway. Here we go. This is for another $50. Aws Promotional credit.

13:15:10
<transcript>: another

13:15:14
<transcript>: Another $50 credit. Redeem. Those things.

13:15:14

13:15:31
yeltrah_: What is the giveaway for?

13:15:33
<transcript>: That what you will and now Chad is gonna be impossible to read as I try to get instructions for git, get logged to get the commit and then get reset just that commit.

13:15:36
<transcript>: And you're saying that I'll just put all my changes into.

13:15:40
neochromer: !giveaway

13:15:41
fossabot: i'm giving away $1000 in aws credits, listen to adam for instructions

13:15:41

<transcript>: the entry

13:15:53
<transcript>: The entry is for a $50 AWS credit. So 50 points for a chance at $50. And dax, you're saying if I do get reset that commit hash, it will just put it into my working changes.

13:15:56
<transcript>: Is that what you're saying.

13:15:57
thdxr: yes

13:16:00
neochromer: spamm fest lol \

13:16:01
<transcript>: I should change that command. Yes. Okay. Perfect.

13:16:01
<transcript>: i should

13:16:01
eddyvinck: Channel points for giveaway entries, nice 👌

13:16:03
<transcript>: I should change that command.

13:16:03
<transcript>: my

13:16:04
<transcript>: My.

13:16:09
blakegreendev: How do I know how many times I’ve submitted?

13:16:12
<transcript>: To change the Fat sabot command to not say a $1,000 because that's saving.

13:16:12
<transcript>: it's twenty

13:16:13
<transcript>: It's 20.

13:16:13
<transcript>: twenty dollars

13:16:14
<transcript>: $20.

13:16:15
<transcript>: which

13:16:17
stalwartcoder: git rm <file> then git amend should works too

13:16:20
oetziofficial: May i ask if these credits have to be used any time?

13:16:23
<transcript>: Which is also a $1,000, but different than giving away one, one $0. How do I know how many times it's submitted? I don't know, Blake. Honestly, I have no idea.

13:16:23
<transcript>: get

13:16:27
<transcript>: Get removed file then get a min should work two.

13:16:27
<transcript>: oh stalwart

13:16:29
<transcript>: Oh, stalwart, that's a good idea.

13:16:34
<transcript>: May I ask if these credits had to be used by any time? Yes. Otsi they had to use this year.

13:16:38
axxeltatto: Hi im new what are you doing?

13:16:39
<transcript>: Okay, I'm cutting you all off. You can put your entries in on the next one if you didn't get it already. And the winner is.

13:16:52
<transcript>: Congratulations, Eddie. You can still win again. I have no limits on how many times any one person can win. So there you go.

13:16:58
<transcript>: victor

13:17:00
oetziofficial: kruzDragonJAM

13:17:02
gerellt: It would be the ultimate rick roll

13:17:03
<transcript>: Victori. Thank you for that. Follow the giveaway entries. Kind of like make it hard to see anything.

13:17:03
<transcript>: because

13:17:06
<transcript>: Because they're very intense.

13:17:09
<transcript>: Eddie vic thanks so much that Follow Eddie.

13:17:09
<transcript>: oh alex

13:17:13
<transcript>: Oh, Alex, with the sub and talent and calf face with the subway that's three days ago.

13:17:20
<transcript>: I'm sorry what? I just scrolled and got to three day ago stuff somehow.

13:17:37
<transcript>: Let's see. Let's see. Does anybody else that followed? I'm sorry if I did. I'm sorry. The giveaway entries. They just, you know, they take over overa. Thank you for that. Tier one sub. I appreciate that. Tier one sub. Brand new. Tier one one month. Let's go.

13:17:57
<transcript>: Eddie, so I will send you food as well. I'll send you the credits just after the stream. Just don't want to try and I will leak them if I try and fumble around and send them to you right now they're just a code that you'll add into your a debs console. And if I try and do it on stream, then the whole world will see it and okay, not the whole world. Everyone that's watching, we'll see it. And then the whole giveaway thing was.

13:17:57
<transcript>: pointless

13:17:59
physotronic: adamdotdev can you talk more about what benefits did you get from using neovim? what can you do there that you cant do in VSC?

13:18:01
<transcript>: Pointless because whoever entered it in first wins.

13:18:02
eddyvinck: Sweet, thanks 🙏

13:18:04
<transcript>: Okay.

13:18:04
<transcript>: let's see

13:18:12
<transcript>: Let's see. Did it. I was doing four things at once. I'm so sorry, dax. This is what happens when I work on a project on stream.

13:18:15
<transcript>: Get removed. Okay, so I'm gonna do git.

13:18:15
<transcript>: reset

13:18:18
<transcript>: Reset and then the commit hash.

13:18:19
stalwartcoder: Lol

13:18:22
<transcript>: And then get status Oh.

13:18:23
<transcript>: That did nothing.

13:18:23
<transcript>: oh

13:18:25
thdxr: reset to my commit

13:18:28
<transcript>: Oh, even worse than nothing. It didn't give me any feedback. I didn't say anything.

13:18:28
<transcript>: res

13:18:31
<transcript>: Reset to your commit.

13:18:33
<transcript>: That was terrifying.

13:18:35
<transcript>: Like okay, I gotcha.

13:18:35
<transcript>: thank you

13:18:37
<transcript>: Thank you, dax, for being patient with me.

13:18:37
<transcript>: i

13:18:39
<transcript>: I apologize.

13:18:46
<transcript>: Next is funny. I totally forgot your last name.

13:18:50
<transcript>: Also just spit really bad. Was that on camera.

13:18:57
0xcouch: What are we working on today?

13:18:58
<transcript>: That makes me laugh. I guess I totally haven't used your last name since. Like you run my first podcast, episode.

13:18:58
<transcript>: and

13:19:00
thdxr: my last name is Elmore

13:19:06
<transcript>: And you are dax, and also your th dxr. But I just did not consider. Oh, no, I'm leaking your email address. Dax, I'm so sorry.

13:19:09
<transcript>: And then I called attention to it. Even worse.

13:19:12
<transcript>: Those are.

13:19:13
thdxr: lol it's ok

13:19:17
<transcript>: Let's remove packages. No, I'm gonna move it.

13:19:18
<transcript>: Your last name is Ellen.

13:19:18
<transcript>: that's funny

13:19:22
<transcript>: That's funny couch. Today we're working on rebates TV.

13:19:31
<transcript>: Don't, Rick, roll me. Don't do it. Imagine almost hitting the five K entry. What's the five K entry.

13:19:38
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat first time Chat so axle.

13:19:57
stalwartcoder: Also add it to gitignore for future  commits :))

13:19:59
<transcript>: First of all, thank you so much for joining on Chad. What I'm doing is working on rebase TV. Kind of we're not. We've not got anything done yet, but that's what I will be doing throughout the stream. Working on rebates TV. It's a project dax and I are working on, but also throughout the stream. I'm gonna give away $50 AWS credits, 20 of them, so total $1,000 in credits.

13:20:05
<transcript>: And I guess theoretically, someone could win all 20 of them, and then you would win a $1,000. So it's not that deceiving.

13:20:05
<transcript>: but

13:20:08
<transcript>: But it is 20 different giveaways.

13:20:11
<transcript>: The catch is.

13:20:11
<transcript>: in order

13:20:17
<transcript>: In order to win, we've done two of them so far. So Food, boob and Eddie have won the first two.

13:20:17
<transcript>: in

13:20:18
<transcript>: In order to win.

13:20:30
<transcript>: You redeemed channel points for entries, and I hit a button. I'm just gonna hit it randomly throughout the stream. And when I hit the button, it'll announce and chat. It's time for a giveaway. Then everyone will start redeeming these things.

13:20:30
<transcript>: you can only redeem

13:20:32
<transcript>: You can only redeem 20 of them.

13:20:32
<transcript>: today

13:20:34
<transcript>: Today. Okay.

13:20:34
<transcript>: so

13:20:45
<transcript>: So there's a limit on each user. You can only redeem 20 of them and there's 20 giveaways. You could do one for each giveaway or you could be like everyone else and dump them all on the first and then not participate.

13:20:48
<transcript>: That's what most everyone seems to have done.

13:20:59
eddyvinck: It worked for me lol

13:21:06
<transcript>: So you have to spend 50 channel points per entry and you know you 20 total today, but there's 20 different giveaways for $50 injuries. I would stick around till the end personally and save one of those entries for that last one. I don't know if anyone's gonna have any rewards they can redeem. Okay.

13:21:13
<transcript>: Imagine almost anything like the injury. Let's go. Let's see. Okay. It would be the ultimate crow. I'm caught up. Adam. Goddev. Psych.

13:21:13
<transcript>: psycho

13:21:33
<transcript>: Psycho. Can you talk more about what benefits did you get from using Neil them? What can you do there that you can't do via C so nothing. I'm honestly, I don't think there's anything I can do in the event I couldn't do invisible Studio code. I use new of it because it's fun. It's a fun hobby for me. Like just like mechanical keyboards. I got really into them. Could I use any old keyboard and get the same job done? Yeah.

13:21:33
<transcript>: but

13:21:41
neochromer: !keyboard

13:21:41
fossabot: Adam uses a custom Mode Eighty mechanical keyboard, and has a collection of other Mode keyboards!

13:21:48
stalwartcoder: It’s a dark side ;)

13:21:48
iamyeizi: @PhysoTronic IMO movements in your code (u can try vim extension on vscode and learn vim motions), lightweight = less ram consumption, clean UI, less distraction and funny

13:21:54
<transcript>: But I got really into just tinkering and building keyboards and enjoying customizing them and all the fun things you can do with the keyboard, same thing with ne of them. It's like I get to tinker with my development environment. This is fun, that's it. I did get a lot of benefits using vim movements and if I were to go back to Vs. Code ever, I probably won't because I'm pretty sold on this experience. But if I did, I would use.

13:21:54
<transcript>: vin bindings

13:21:54
neochromer: I just got myself a new nuphy

13:21:59
<transcript>: Vin bindings and I would get most of the benefit in terms of like efficiency of editing text.

13:21:59
<transcript>: okay

13:22:02
<transcript>: Okay. I'm gonna try and focus now.

13:22:04
nft_scam: only thing i like is the vim motion

13:22:09
<transcript>: Did it add. Did it add it to Gitagon. I'm just gonna move it out of that directory.

13:22:09
<transcript>: key

13:22:11
<transcript>: Keyboard.

13:22:11
<transcript>: it's a dark side

13:22:26
<transcript>: It's a dark side. Okay, I gotta catch up. I mean, I just gotta move faster with my brain or something. First time chat. Welcome to Chat. I am easy movements in your code. You can try vim extension of vehicle lightweight equals less Ram consumption. Yeah, all those things are true too. It does use less memory.

13:22:29
thdxr: Adam make the commit!

13:22:34
thdxr: I wanna add my changes

13:22:40
<transcript>: Fun fact. I bought a $50,000 Mac Pro and installed all 44, 300 whatever vs. Code extensions. It was dumb because you install 500 vs. Code extensions and you can't use ds code anymore. It's completely unusable. So there you go.

13:22:45
<transcript>: I wonder if you didn't follow 500 neo vim plugins.

13:22:45
<transcript>: and it still out

13:23:04
<transcript>: And it still outrate. I bet it would. I guess the plugins could be different degrees of complexity, and that would totally skew the results. But I just got myself a newfie oh, newfie. Those are good. Those are cool keyboards. I think I've seen that. Okay. Make the commit only thing like it's a video.

13:23:09
<transcript>: I'm so sorry to ask. I really am a terrible partner. I should never try and stream.

13:23:09
<transcript>: okay

13:23:11
<transcript>: Okay. I just need to move.

13:23:13
<transcript>: Packages.

13:23:13
<transcript>: it is so

13:23:17
<transcript>: It is so hard when I can't see stream test mp4.

13:23:17
<transcript>: okay

13:23:23
<transcript>: Okay, move it. I'm gonna move it to where I'm gonna move it to.

13:23:29
<transcript>: Adam, we're just moving it right here. Stream, test. Mp4. How about that.

13:23:29
<transcript>: okay

13:23:37
<transcript>: Okay. Get status. I'm so sorry to ask. I feel so bad right now. Can you tell that I feel bad? Does that make it any better.

13:23:43
<transcript>: Animation progress. I can't see what I'm typing so it's probably not gonna be what I thought it was push.

13:23:45
rudixworld: is there self-hosted solution for what GitHub called - "workspaces" .. its an IDE as I can see

13:23:50
cowfacedude99: I think you could go farther than 500 plugins with nvim. and lazy loading everything will make it usable.

13:23:50
<transcript>: You forgive me? Dax, can we hug it out over some among us later.

13:23:53
physotronic: iamyeizi what do you mean by movement? can you explain a bit more so I get image of what you mean

13:23:54
<transcript>: Ali to you straight to your face for like an hour.

13:23:54
<transcript>: we can maybe

13:23:56
<transcript>: We can maybe make up.

13:24:03
<transcript>: Is there a self host solution for what github called workspaces. It's a ide. As I can see.

13:24:03
<transcript>: i've not used

13:24:06
<transcript>: I've not used workspaces. I think there's a lot of things like it, though, right.

13:24:06
<transcript>: i don't know

13:24:13
<transcript>: I don't know if any of myself hosted, but I know there's a lot of things in that like click a button, get a dev environment.

13:24:20
<transcript>: I think you go further than 500 plugins with new of them and lazy Loading everything will make it useable interesting.

13:24:27
<transcript>: So that's a fun test. See at what point vs. Code falls over when you add more plugins and then.

13:24:27
<transcript>: how far

13:24:32
<transcript>: How far can you go? They're like endurance runners.

13:24:32
<transcript>: what do you

13:24:43
<transcript>: What do you mean by movement? Can explain a bit more. So I get images of what you mean. I think I think he's just saying, like, moving around in text. So if I'm here in this file, not that file. If I'm in here and I'm like, flying around, I want to, like, find.

13:24:51
<transcript>: Or like, okay, here's. This used animated style. It's got a bunch of contents. So let's say I did like.

13:24:51
<transcript>: that and i

13:24:55
<transcript>: That. And I want to highlight it all, and then replace it with something.

13:24:55
<transcript>: and i

13:25:02
iamyeizi: @PhysoTronic move through your code, adding words, deleting, inserting lines, etc

13:25:05
<transcript>: And I could just start typing. I mean, there's just like the vim movements make it a lot easier to kind of like edit a text file quickly and efficiently with as little.

13:25:05
<transcript>: fanfare as

13:25:08
<transcript>: Fanfare as possible. What is this? What is this.

13:25:12
<transcript>: Lsp restart.

13:25:15
<transcript>: I don't know if this is actually an issue.

13:25:15
<transcript>: oh this

13:25:23
iamyeizi: obviously requires some practice

13:25:24
<transcript>: Oh, this is. Oh, yeah, yeah, no, this is a problem with that library. It's really annoying. I'm sorry to act if you've seen that. There's. There's a problem. There's a way you can fix it with a patch.

13:25:24
<transcript>: but i don't know

13:25:27
<transcript>: But I don't know how to do that. Get patch or something.

13:25:35
cowfacedude99: @RudixWorld I'd come pretty close with my neovim+nix setup on pretty much any cheap vm.

13:25:37
<transcript>: Just watch. Yeah, watch Primagin on twitch for like ten minutes. And you'll understand the power of improvement.

13:25:44
<transcript>: Thanks so much for Follow. I am sander, axel, tattoo, and brezerk.

13:25:46
<transcript>: Okay.

13:25:51
<transcript>: Let's.

13:25:51
<transcript>: sex

13:25:59
neochromer: @adamdotdev no vim motions will help my Brain be faser :D

13:26:02
<transcript>: Sex. I've pushed the stuff to you. You haven't responded since I did. I think you might be mad at me, but I think you're adding your code, and you're gonna push it, and then I'm gonna pull it. So now's a good time for me to just talk. Let's just talk.

13:26:06
<transcript>: Matthos Bob thanks for so much for the follow.

13:26:09
physotronic: is vim and neovim same thing? I assume that neovim has more stuff coming with it by default if I am not mistaken?

13:26:09
neochromer: thats the bottleneck

13:26:11
<transcript>: Do you want to do another guy? Number three. What's your number three.

13:26:15
<transcript>: Excuse me.

13:26:15
<transcript>: no vim

13:26:18
<transcript>: No vim motions will help my brain be faster.

13:26:23
cowfacedude99: @NeoChromer You are emacs user. can't trust you LUL

13:26:25
<transcript>: That's the bottleneck. A lot of people say that I thought I probably had the same argument.

13:26:25
<transcript>: before i

13:26:28
<transcript>: Before I really used vim at all.

13:26:28
<transcript>: and

13:26:34
<transcript>: And I will say I surprised myself with some of the things that.

13:26:34
<transcript>: it's not really

13:26:35
iamyeizi: neovim is modern, with some tweaks

13:26:41
thdxr: ok I pushed my changes again

13:26:43
eddyvinck: You get used to it tbh

13:26:47
thdxr: lmk if your TS becomes super laggy

13:26:53
iamyeizi: @PhysoTronic right

13:26:53
<transcript>: It's not really like your brain is the bottom. Like, for every single thing, for some things, for sure. But I think there are a lot of things that are just like, I know what I need to do to this file, and I can do it a lot faster than I used to. Okay. Zach pushes changes just as I came over here. Well, just to make it worth it, let me know if your ts becomes super leggy. Okay.

13:26:53
<transcript>: we're gonna do

13:26:53
stalwartcoder: Muscle memory

13:27:03
<transcript>: We're gonna do a giveaway just since I came over here, we're gonna do a giveaway, so just remember, you'll only get 20 redemptions, 20 redemptions, this entire stream. And there's 20 giveaways.

13:27:03
<transcript>: so that

13:27:07

eddyvinck: Stop the count 😝

13:27:53

<transcript>: So many points being redeemed.

13:28:29
overra_dev: congrats!

13:28:37

<transcript>: It, pull.

13:30:59
thdxr: lol

13:30:59
cowfacedude99: I spent all mine on rick rolls

13:31:03
<transcript>: Okay. Done.

13:31:08
<transcript>: See if I have this changes.

13:31:12
laytanl_: @cowfacedude99 same haha

13:31:13

13:31:16
<transcript>: Trpc. There it is.

13:31:28
<transcript>: Oh, calf is. I'm so sorry. I will. Rick, roll myself. I'll recreate myself twice. Someone else did it. And I'm sorry for that. I hope they're here. I don't remember who it was.

13:31:42
<transcript>: Oh, no. Coffee. Do not have enough point to do redeems right now.

13:31:45

<transcript>: Okay? Tmp? Dev.

13:32:01
cowfacedude99: that much should be enough.

13:32:03
<transcript>: You've got three K, you're good.

13:32:12
<transcript>: That should be enough for the giveaway. I think 10 points is the most you could spend today on the giveaways. Oh, it's gonna show the stream code. No, no.

13:32:16
<transcript>: I don't want to show that one.

13:32:20
nft_scam: monkaS

13:32:21
<transcript>: Okay. Can't see it when it's that like that cool.

13:32:29
<transcript>: Next. I shouldn't export that dax. I shouldn't export stream code.

13:32:29
<transcript>: and

13:32:31
<transcript>: And the key, or the stream key.

13:32:31
<transcript>: it's

13:32:36
<transcript>: It's probably a bad idea. Oh, it's doing a lot of work, actually. It's deploying some changes, isn't it.

13:32:40
<transcript>: Here. I'm gonna do yarn, iOS.

13:32:41
sj_se: hello

13:32:41
<transcript>: Clear.

<transcript>: I've got.

13:32:52
<transcript>: to change

13:33:00
<transcript>: To change the path. I'll just do it in this command. Why not? We're waiting on ssd to deploy all that stuff anyway.

13:33:03
<transcript>: Ingesting point. Here it is.

13:33:05
<transcript>: It's going to be.

13:33:16
<transcript>: Oh, no. In. Just implants on it. It's the inner file. Video file path. Oh, bummer. Oh, here, I can do this.

13:33:18
<transcript>: Here we go.

13:33:21
<transcript>: Look at that vim to the rescue.

13:33:27
<transcript>: I'm gonna do.

13:35:32
<transcript>: i just

13:35:38
laytanl_: what typescript magic did you add lol @thdxr

13:35:40
<transcript>: I just did an lst restart because that was. That wasn't working. So ts. So I need to check and see if ts works. Let's see. What would I do.

13:35:45
<transcript>: I guess I would actually do real work.

13:35:50
<transcript>: I just did some real work that would tell me if ts was laggy right.

13:35:50
thdxr: check the stream variablen

13:36:00
<transcript>: Let's see if the app works. No Tan sac react query could not be found. Oh, I need to do yarn install, too, don't I.

13:36:06
<transcript>: Need any do yarn install. I haven't actually done yarn saw. I just did PNP install at the root.

13:36:09
<transcript>: Can you confirm or deny.

13:36:11
thdxr: type stream.data. and see if it autocompletes url

13:36:12
caasidev: hey Adam, how are you?

13:36:17
<transcript>: Type stream data.

13:36:17
<transcript>: can you confirm that i

<transcript>: Can you confirm that I should have yarn installed so I hadn't yarn installed yet.

13:36:23
thdxr: I thought we do pnpm i inside the

13:36:25
thdxr: app

13:36:33
<transcript>: Hey, cassie, I'm good. How are you? I thought we do npm inside the app. Oh, I've been doing pmp or I've been doing the yarn inside the app because it's a yarn lock file.

13:36:35
<transcript>: Should I not be doing yarn.

13:36:38
thdxr: oh lol

13:36:40
<transcript>: My messing something up every time I do that probably.

13:36:40
<transcript>: oh

13:36:42
<transcript>: Oh.

13:36:45
thdxr: we don't need to use yarn right

13:36:46
<transcript>: Okay, so do stream.

13:36:46
<transcript>: dot

13:36:47
<transcript>: Dot data.

13:37:58
<transcript>: to curse

13:38:06
<transcript>: To curse. I should put these on the sound, like the vertical. They should be over on the side. I just made them like this today. And I was like, Why did I do that.

13:38:06
<transcript>: inside

13:38:12
<transcript>: Inside App folder? Yeah, I'm inside the App folder. And I do pmpn gmpm install.

13:38:36
<transcript>: Do you have cocoa pods installed? Yes, I've definitely run the app.

13:38:36
<transcript>: recently

13:38:37
<transcript>: Recently.

13:38:39
<transcript>: Let's try.

13:38:39
<transcript>: let's

13:38:41
thdxr: maybe we do use yarn...thought I was using pnpm for everything

13:38:42
<transcript>: Let's try yarn iOS.

13:38:52
<transcript>: Maybe we do use yarn. Thought I was using pmp for everything. Remember, Expo doesn't work with pnpm or something. Something like that.

13:39:00
<transcript>: Build input file cannot be found.

13:39:02
<transcript>: Is this.

13:39:06
<transcript>: Rebate packages App node modules.

13:39:11
<transcript>: So that did you forget to clear this files and output custom build.

13:39:13
sm1sko: Delete node_modules and package.lock ?

13:39:15
<transcript>: I remember I had to like, do.

13:39:21
<transcript>: Yeah let's delete yeah, yeah remove rf node models.

13:39:27
<transcript>: Do that. Thank you. Welcome to Chat sm. One SCO.

13:39:32
<transcript>: Let's do yarn install.

13:39:42
<transcript>: And then I'm pretty sure how to do like an Expo thing to make it build the iOS depending, but I thought doing yarn iOS did that.

13:39:49
<transcript>: I think I can do like mpx Expo.

13:39:51
<transcript>: Install.

13:39:53
oetziofficial: So many package managers kruzEw

13:39:55
<transcript>: Aws, what is the package called.

13:39:57
sm1sko: Wait why are you using yarn and pnpm at the same time?

13:40:03
<transcript>: Where is it.

13:40:04
<transcript>: That one.

13:40:15
<transcript>: Do the native thing.

13:40:15
<transcript>: so many

13:40:18
<transcript>: So many package managers, it's obnoxious.

13:40:20
<transcript>: Okay yarn iOS.

13:40:32
<transcript>: Sorry. I know that this view is very hard to make sense of. We're just trying to build the app again and it's not building what is what is going on.

13:40:34
<transcript>: Build input file.

13:40:34
<transcript>: can't be

13:40:36
<transcript>: Can't be found.

13:40:40

13:40:40

13:40:53
eddyvinck: We need another package manager to rule them all Kappa

13:40:56
<transcript>: In sm One, we're using yarn inside our stupid Expo app because it doesn't work with pnpm.

13:41:00
<transcript>: We're using pnpm at the root for the whole project.

13:41:00
<transcript>: but it's like a

13:41:02
massabrutto: pods install?

13:41:06
<transcript>: But it's like a pmp and Monterrepo, but we can't use it inside the Expo Project. It breaks.

13:41:07
sj_se: nice. which theme is that?

13:41:09
<transcript>: Pods, install.

13:41:09

13:41:42
<transcript>: Mario When I was a yarn iOS.

13:41:49
<transcript>: Hey, I think it's doing more than it was doing. Maybe not.

13:41:49
<transcript>: i might just be over

13:41:51

13:44:56
<transcript>: i should

13:45:00

<transcript>: Very descriptive.

<transcript>: You can only redeem.

13:45:59
<transcript>: 20.

13:46:21
<transcript>: Whatever. That's better at least, but it's better than my head cannot read property. Let's see. Oh new error. New error cannot reprop the abort on unmount of null.

13:46:23
<transcript>: That's a strange one.

13:46:26
<transcript>: Strange one aboard.

13:46:26
<transcript>: on unknown

13:46:32
<transcript>: On unknown. Where does that in create hooks? Internal? Is that something you made? Dax.

13:46:35
<transcript>: Is that like userland code, or is that.

13:46:39
<transcript>: Art. Ct. View Created by view.

13:46:44
<transcript>: What's? Think about that.

13:46:49

<transcript>: I don't know when in doubt.

13:46:58
<transcript>: Next is here. Next is here.

13:46:58
laytanl_: If the stream f's we get that limit reset 🤔

13:46:59
thdxr: maybe remove the tRPC provider and see if it all just works without it

13:47:06
<transcript>: If the stream s, we get that limit reset.

13:47:06
<transcript>: don't do it

13:47:14
<transcript>: Don't do it late and don't find some way to crash my stream, but yes, you will maybe remove the trpc provider and see if it all just works without it. Okay.

13:47:21
<transcript>: Idaxis this is probably frustrating one watching me just fluffs around and be super slow but.

13:47:21
<transcript>: to

13:47:22
<transcript>: To.

13:47:26
oetziofficial: My breaks over, gotta continue coding. Catch y'all later, have fun!

13:47:32
<transcript>: Rpc stuff and trying to debug through my screen and then I'm like giveaway time then I'm like Pay for the follow but but 2000.

13:47:33
thdxr: I'm playing with my dog anyway

13:47:35
<transcript>: That was my best guess. It the name on Twitch.

13:47:45
<transcript>: Let's try that. Did I mess up the markup? Yes, I did. I did mess up the markup.

13:47:45
<transcript>: let's undo

13:47:46
<transcript>: Let's undo.

13:47:49
<transcript>: Okay.

13:47:49
<transcript>: can't use

13:47:53

13:47:56
<transcript>: Are your playing with your dog anyway cool.

13:48:03
<transcript>: My breakfast over got continued coding catch all later C O E T It's so nice to see you again.

<transcript>: we'll see you next time

13:48:04
<transcript>: We'll see you next time.

13:48:15
<transcript>: Okay. This is back to what I expect. Now I'm gonna just try collapsing all of this.

13:48:19
<transcript>: Oh, come on, there we go? I'm gonna try just deleting.

13:48:19
<transcript>: the provider

13:48:20
<transcript>: The provider.

13:48:24
nexxeln: how do i participate in a rebase game show?

13:48:25
<transcript>: Leaving everything else. And now we're gonna rebuild.

13:48:28
<transcript>: Start over? I'm gonna do.

13:48:28
<transcript>: this

13:48:29
<transcript>: This.

13:48:35
neochromer: uu I lovbe the new nvim config

13:48:35
<transcript>: How do I participate in rebates Game Show next? Well, it's we're building it.

13:48:39
neochromer: you really got into it fast

13:48:39
<transcript>: We haven't had the first show. We are gonna have some private shows.

13:48:42
<transcript>: And I would guess.

13:48:45
<transcript>: I would guess.

13:48:55
<transcript>: That you folks here. You find folks in my twitch chat. We'll have an opportunity to be part of some of the private early shows while we're beta testing.

13:49:01
<transcript>: So that'll be coming. You'll hear about it if you just kind of like, follow me anywhere on the Internet, I'll be talking about it a lot.

13:49:01
<transcript>: bored

13:49:06
<transcript>: Bored on unmount cannot read so it didn't change anything. This is in use queries.

13:49:21
<transcript>: So do we have actually our we using use query. Oh, we sure are stream is to see streamcreate use query.

13:49:22
thdxr: remove the use query line

13:49:26
<transcript>: What is that? Do? What is that? Query? Do.

13:49:33
<transcript>: Stream that data. That's how you get the data. Url.

13:49:38
<transcript>: Remove the use query line. Do you want me to put the provider back or leave it.

13:49:40
thdxr: and hardcore the stream url to an empty string

13:49:44
<transcript>: Love the new neovm config. You really got into it fast. Thanks. Neocromer.

13:49:48
<transcript>: Hard code the stream URL to an empty string.

13:49:50
thdxr: just want to get everything working without tRPC

13:49:57
<transcript>: Just want to get everything working without trpc. Okay, so leave the provider out.

13:49:57
<transcript>: and

13:50:02
<transcript>: And just we're gonna just get rid of this. And we're gonna say.

13:50:10
<transcript>: Wait.

13:50:13
<transcript>: Where's that stream URL coming from.

13:50:23
<transcript>: You see this one back.

13:50:23
<transcript>: that's

13:50:26
<transcript>: That's not set to anything.

13:50:28
thdxr: oh that maybe the error I didn't realize it was used in two places

13:50:31
<transcript>: Should that be? Maybe that's the problem. No, probably not. But I'm gonna change it to be.

13:50:35
<transcript>: Yeah. She's in two places. So let's just do.

13:50:39
<transcript>: Stream, data, url, or something? Is that what it was.

13:50:42
<transcript>: You got data at url, no. Three.

13:50:45
<transcript>: Do this.

13:50:48
<transcript>: Should I re add the provider, maybe.

13:50:52
<transcript>: Oh, no. Did I have a typo? What.

13:50:52
<transcript>: i just use anim

13:50:54
<transcript>: I just use animated style.

13:50:54
<transcript>: we come out

13:50:55
<transcript>: We come out.

13:51:03
<transcript>: That's weird.

13:51:12
<transcript>: So we'll leave it without the provider. We'll try it and then see what it says.

13:51:19
<transcript>: I'm just looking at debug output here.

13:51:22
<transcript>: Or blending stuff.

13:51:22
<transcript>: okay let's just try

13:51:23
<transcript>: Okay, let's just try it.

13:51:32
<transcript>: Let's just try it.

13:51:37
<transcript>: We don't have the trpc pervider now, so I don't know if that's problem.

13:51:40
<transcript>: Now.

13:51:40
<transcript>: it

13:51:45

13:52:13
<transcript>: i don't

13:52:16
<transcript>: I don't know if we decided if we're gonna stream it or not.

13:52:26
<transcript>: Okay, so that didn't fix it. I'm gonna kill that on my cop here. And we're gonna say, let's just do the hardcoding thing. Like you said the first time.

13:52:26
<transcript>: and we'll just

13:52:28
<transcript>: And we'll just say.

13:52:28

<transcript>: To Move and click the activate Button. It's tedious.

13:53:20
<transcript>: makes you

13:53:26
<transcript>: Makes you look real dumb and really slow which I already did because I was new.

13:53:26
<transcript>: but

13:53:30
<transcript>: But even dumber, even slower. You know, I'm saying it was bad.

13:53:37
<transcript>: All right, dax. So we've got we've got an issue with use, query.

13:53:37
<transcript>: how

13:53:38
grasp5533: Are you going to build an android for rebase.tv also?

13:53:40
<transcript>: How much should I try to figure this out.

13:53:53
<transcript>: You're gonna build an Android for you based? Yes grass. We're using Expo, which is built on top of React native and we will have Android support from day One. Feels good.

13:53:58
thdxr: didn't you remove useQuery

13:54:07
<transcript>: Feels good. Mike. Legos. I love legos, Mike. Thanks so much to follow. Didn't your move U square? Yeah, yeah, it works without use. Query.

13:54:10
<transcript>: oh you're saying

13:54:11
thdxr: oh ok

13:54:15
<transcript>: Oh, you're saying just hard coded while I do my work, like you know me, just hard code the stream to one that works.

13:54:15
eddyvinck: You can use tRPC with React Native? I’ve yet to try it

13:54:17
thdxr: yeah

13:54:18
<transcript>: For what we send.

13:54:24
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah, I'll do that. I'll just hard code. It.

13:54:25
thdxr: gonna try fixing now

13:54:28
<transcript>: I don't want to do that.

13:54:31
<transcript>: So.

<transcript>: That's all.

13:54:55
<transcript>: don't be

13:55:00
<transcript>: Don't be dumb at them. You can do this. Can add your old code back in. Oh.

13:55:04
<transcript>: Just like fetch to this endpoint. Yeah.

13:55:07
<transcript>: Well, but I would have to.

13:55:11
<transcript>: Let's come over here. What is this? What was I doing in this one.

13:55:15
<transcript>: It worked. Okay.

13:55:17
<transcript>: Export.

13:55:22
<transcript>: I just need the api URL.

13:55:28
<transcript>: I'm really dumb back don't watch me I'm gonna do something really dumb.

13:55:28
<transcript>: i don't know

13:55:30
<transcript>: I don't know how.

13:55:30
<transcript>: api

13:55:32
<transcript>: Api, gateway.

13:55:32
<transcript>: how else do

13:55:34
<transcript>: How else do it right now.

13:55:38
<transcript>: I'm just gonna go in here and find the thing.

13:55:39
fragaverage: what is going on here

13:55:41
<transcript>: Adam rebase API.

13:55:44
<transcript>: Frag? What's going on.

13:56:05
fragaverage: im messing with Dynamo today

13:56:14
<transcript>: Messing with dynamo today? Hey, rebase uses dynamo. Maybe I'll just hit it. I'll just hit it with my browser.

13:56:14
<transcript>: like

13:56:16
<transcript>: Like a dummy.

13:56:17
fragaverage: max 25 updates is annoying isn't it

13:56:21
<transcript>: Api. No, not even api. Just slash stream.

13:56:25
nft_scam: !giveaway

13:56:25

13:56:42
<transcript>: Why would it be forbidden.

13:56:45
<transcript>: Soding it over.

13:56:52

13:56:52
<transcript>: i can't

13:56:57
<transcript>: I can't remember which one's? 25. I think they up to the transactions to 100.

13:56:59
<transcript>: like

13:57:03

13:57:06
<transcript>: Okay. It's saying forbidden.

eddyvinck: Thank you @cowfacedude99

13:57:52
<transcript>: one of these

13:58:03
<transcript>: One of these giveaways. I'm gonna just do it so slow, I'm gonna do it so fast, like, I'm gonna be like, start it. And then there's just gonna be some entries I'm gonna do end it like this one. End it. Who's the winner? The winner is calface.

13:58:03
<transcript>: look at you

13:58:12
nft_scam: 🐮 face

13:58:21
<transcript>: I'm doing 15 more giveaways. Oh, no, calfase. Tell me you actually entered. Did you not enter? Oh, no, there's a flaw. There's a bug in the code.

13:58:21
<transcript>: no you entered

13:58:24
nft_scam: wait

13:58:24
<transcript>: No, you entered calf. It is only one entry, though.

13:58:25
cowfacedude99: I did

13:58:28
laytanl_: Ayoo I was alt-tabbing

13:58:30
<transcript>: Only one you did. I'd saw it. But just one of them.

13:58:30

13:58:32
<transcript>: That was lucky.

13:58:37
zakhal2: It’s not working for me

13:58:37
<transcript>: Oh, late. And did you miss it? It's okay. I'm gonna do another one really soon.

13:58:37
<transcript>: i've got to still do this

13:58:38
ogasege: Guys, hear me out. Let only me go for the next giveaway and I win and we are all winners

13:58:42
<transcript>: I've got to still do this. 15 of them. It's not working for you.

13:58:44
<transcript>: Zack.

13:58:44
<transcript>: welcome to chat

13:58:44
ogasege: What do y'all think?

13:58:47
cowfacedude99: I'll send my details on on discord later.

13:58:48
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. First of all, second of all, when you say it's not working like you can't redeem.

13:58:48
<transcript>: the redeem

13:58:50
<transcript>: The redeem thing.

13:58:56
<transcript>: Thanks Scott face. That'd be great so I can internet stock you with your details.

13:58:56
<transcript>: hear me out

13:58:59
zakhal2: It says Out of stock

13:58:59
stalwartcoder: I just have 20 bits 😂😂😂😂

13:59:01
<transcript>: Hear me out. Let only me go for the next giveaway and I win. We are all winning. What do you like.

13:59:01
<transcript>: says

13:59:02
maleero: You're screwing up my late game play by ending it early! Let them use all of their entries LUL

13:59:06
<transcript>: Says out of stock. Have you done it 20 times? Zacle.

13:59:06
<transcript>: if you've done

13:59:08
<transcript>: If you've done it over 20 times.

13:59:11
cowfacedude99: or you can just send them on discord.

13:59:15
<transcript>: Let's use all their entries. I'll let some of them run on for a while. We got a bunch of them.

13:59:17
zakhal2: I’m not sure

13:59:18
nft_scam: unfortunate

13:59:19
<transcript>: I'll listen to one discord that makes sense. Calf base.

13:59:21
adamdotdev: !discord

13:59:22
fossabot: Adam has a Discord server and he'd love to see you there: https://discord.gg/E92M2chd3e

13:59:26
<transcript>: Hey, that's a great plug for the discord, discord, discord, you join the discord? There's an easy way from its end to your credits.

13:59:46
<transcript>: I'm gonna be doing more with that discord sometime soon. So, zack, you say it says out of stock, it only is when I hit the button. It makes it enabled where you can redeem it. And then when I hit the off button, you can't redeem anymore. So that's one thing. It's only available for a short window time. And then you have to have 50 points channel points, and then.

13:59:56
<transcript>: Out of stock might mean you've already done 20. If you've entered in your name 20 times already, then that would also mean it's out of stock. There's only 20. Everyone gets 20 goes at it.

13:59:56
<transcript>: across all

14:00:01
<transcript>: Across all 20 giveaways it's kind of a weird system. I don't know if anyone's gonna be around at the end.

14:00:03
<transcript>: Hopefully.

14:00:08
<transcript>: Okay, let's actually get some work done. That'd be fun.

14:00:11
<transcript>: You name this one.

14:00:16
fragaverage: If I did 20 on the first, I cant enter the rest? or its pooled?

14:00:19
<transcript>: Five cafes. That was just the fifth one.

14:00:23
<transcript>: Just the fifth one.

14:00:25
<transcript>: The Times. Okay. 15 more hunts.

14:00:25
<transcript>: so

14:00:35
<transcript>: So why if I did 20 on the first, I can't enter the rest. Yeah, sorry, frag. That's how it works. You just get 20 in this entire stream.

14:00:40
fragaverage: I didn't, was theory

14:00:40
nft_scam: Sadge

14:00:42
