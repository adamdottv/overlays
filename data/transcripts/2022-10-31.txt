00:17:08

I've always wished I, like, sat at the table with a cup of coffee and a paper in the mornings. That's the thing. I'm just like, not like, trolling.

2dorkstv: hang in there, @stroopwafel26!

00:18:48
<transcript>: There were some not good sessions.

00:19:07

<transcript>: And that's not like.

<transcript>: That feels that feels really like Abrasive. I'm not trying to be mean.

00:19:22
<transcript>: but

00:19:31
<transcript>: But like clearly a bunch of them paid verselle to get to have a slot in Next Conf, and Versell turned none of them down.

00:19:32
cowfacedude99: hope you do one for vimconf too LUL

00:19:33
<transcript>: None of them.

00:19:38
stroopwafel26: In the meeting, a guy suggested to solve ALL performance issues by moving gp2 volumes to gp3. I didn't know what to say it was so stupid, so after the meeting I dropped CloudWatch graphs into chat to show how stupid of an idea it was.

00:19:43
<transcript>: Complin is incompet. I've heard that a certain couple of streamers that I'm a big fan of headline. Vm. Comp.

00:20:15
<transcript>: Anytime you have to drop Cloudwide Watch graphs into a meeting. It's a good sign. It was a bad meeting. Welcome to Chat Joe Quinn. Alright, let's actually do something. Let's do something. Let's do it.

nate_codes: DO NOT DISRESPECT THE RICK

00:21:25
joaquimley: @totorayn build simple apps so you deal with problems first hand.

00:21:27
nate_codes: NO

00:21:36
<transcript>: For one. I can't put it on the VOD, so I have to route it through a special routing thing that goes to channel two and not channel one, so it doesn't go in the VOD. But I can't do that with Chrome because Chrome sucks. Chrome on a Mac sucks. I don't know why I still use it. I should just stop using it.

00:21:37
2dorkstv: @totorayn do stuff you're slightly uncomfortable with, but have some roots. Come up with something goofy to build for yourself, and just poke at it

00:21:44
nate_codes: Whoops still caps. Nah I should switch my avatars to live

00:21:44
<transcript>: Build simple apps so you deal with problems first hand? Oh, yeah, yeah? Tell Toto what to do.

00:21:44
<transcript>: it usually boils down

00:21:46
stroopwafel26: Use Firefox, it's what the cool people use

00:21:50
<transcript>: It usually boils down to like actually build things. Don't don't spend too long just listening and reading stuff.

00:21:52
jamdotexe: Tips for a junior... get your hands dirty, learn to read docs well (go to the source instead of Medium, Quora etc.), stop procrastinating!

<transcript>: But build it and then figure out ways to make it better or change it and see how that works. Here's another tip. This is a tip. I'm probably gonna make a video about this.

00:22:06
<transcript>: you don't

00:22:17
jamdotexe: I started backend :)

00:22:26
<transcript>: You don't have to start with the front end. I don't know. Maybe there's like maybe the job market is such that all junior developer jobs are front end. And that's why everyone starts with front end. But I would be so overwhelmed starting in front of land. If I were just beginning my journey into programming, I would much prefer to build little CLI apps, command.

00:22:26
<transcript>: line

00:22:37
<transcript>: Line apps where you just take in text and you do a thing. Maybe you hit an API like you could learn so much about programming and never have to touch. React CSS.

00:22:37
<transcript>: browsers

00:22:38
<transcript>: Browsers.

00:22:40
<transcript>: State management.

00:22:45
joaquimley: Uh stable diffusion? This has been a trend hehe

00:22:46
2dorkstv: I like building stuff someone already built just so I know what the end should be able to do. Think of it as "tracing" like an artist does to learn

00:22:47
<transcript>: All kinds of stuff. What? There's all kinds of stuff that's so hard in the front end. It's so complicated.

00:22:51
<transcript>: Use Firefox is what the cool people use. Is that right.

00:22:51
<transcript>: i

00:22:55
<transcript>: I just I really don't know. I've heard people use brave. I don't know.

00:22:58
<transcript>: People who care about Privacy.

00:22:58
oetziofficial: frontend has a quicker feedback loop. i don't know how backend can achieve that

00:22:58
totorayn: @joaquimley Thank you

00:23:03
macmike69: i never come across noobs who aren't interested in web stuff

00:23:05
<transcript>: Do stuff your slightly uncomfortable with who I love that but have some roots.

00:23:05
<transcript>: come up with something

00:23:05
cowfacedude99: I would push people to robotics but I don't think it has a good job market

00:23:06
totorayn: @2DorksTV <3

00:23:08
<transcript>: Come up with something goofy to build for yourself and just look at it. Love it.

00:23:12
<transcript>: Nate, you're still in Cats? Didn't know it.

00:23:19
<transcript>: Okay. There is a thing. There's an app that does it. You're gonna have to Google it. I honestly don't remember what it's called.

00:23:22
<transcript>: And I don't even know how to find out.

00:23:24
2dorkstv: I've started using Brave because FF started freezing randomly on me for up to 30 seconds at a time 0_o

00:23:25
<transcript>: There's probably a way, but I don't know how.

00:23:26
stroopwafel26: If you care about privacy and use Brave you have to learn a bit more about privacy

00:23:31
<transcript>: Something does it something has permission to take over my Twitter and put that thing on there.

00:23:34
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Splinter.

00:23:37
<transcript>: You just join the stream we got recalled.

00:23:37
<transcript>: jim

00:23:41
<transcript>: Jim Dot started on the back end. Me too. I think. I'm not sure. Actually.

00:23:44
<transcript>: Yeah, we're gonna do some stable diffusion stuff.

00:23:44
<transcript>: like building stuff

00:23:46
cowfacedude99: you can check your permissions on twitter later

00:23:46
<transcript>: Like building stuff someone already built.

00:23:46
<transcript>: just so i know

00:23:53
nate_codes: Oof I can't think of it either. Theo and prime use it I'm p sure

00:24:05
<transcript>: Just so I know the end should be able to. Yeah, yeah, that's good advice. Oh, it's front end is a quicker feedback loop. Don't know how back and can achieve that. So here's my thing. Otsi it's not backend personal, but building a CLI app, you get the same feedback loop just without having to worry about how a thing looks like the style of the UI. Like all of those things.

00:24:05
<transcript>: that you

00:24:14
<transcript>: That you don't have to think about when it's a CLI app, so you still get feedback like hit enter on the command. Does a thing gives you some kind of response or output.

00:24:15
jamdotexe: With backend you can really focus on clean coding IMO

00:24:16
oetziofficial: oh true!

00:24:19
<transcript>: Neon Dactyl? Thank you for Follow Missouri Friends unite.

00:24:23
<transcript>: For front end as a query about Yeah.

00:24:23
<transcript>: i never came across

00:24:24
<transcript>: I never came across.

00:24:24
<transcript>: new

00:24:25
<transcript>: New.

00:24:25
<transcript>: newb stuff

00:24:27
<transcript>: Newb stuff.

00:24:27
<transcript>: i would push people

00:24:27
jamdotexe: Also, less technologies to learn

00:24:28
nate_codes: Get out of my brain I was just researching stable diffusion last week lol.

00:24:38
<transcript>: I would push people to robotics. Oh, now we're talking hardware projects. You don't have to do. Robots just do, like a Raspberry Pi. There's a fun place to start with programming. That's a whole nother thing.

00:24:47
<transcript>: Check my permissions on Twitter later. That's a good idea. That's how I could find that what that app is called.

00:24:53
<transcript>: Yeah, CEO and prime use it. I know CEO uses it. I didn't know prime used it.

00:24:55
joaquimley: Cool term “setup”, very clean

00:25:02
macmike69: i have a final project coming up for my arduino class, making ultrasonic glasses for blind ppl

00:25:05
<transcript>: Less technology's learned that's the thing about the back end or that's the thing about CLI's. Even like a hardware project. Just there's so much. When you start building a front end, you have to start learning.

00:25:05
<transcript>: bundlers

00:25:07
<transcript>: Bundlers.

00:25:07
<transcript>: and

00:25:08
<transcript>: And.

00:25:08
<transcript>: transpire

00:25:09
<transcript>: Transpire.

00:25:13
<transcript>: Stuff.

00:25:24
kedemel: Years ago, Webpack messed me up

00:25:28
<transcript>: Okay, let's do it. Get out of my brain. I was just researching stables using last week. Well, if we got a stream for you, Nate, if you're sticking around, I don't know if you're gonna be here, but so we did this last week. We actually played with us. Are some music.

00:25:28
<transcript>: just start

00:25:30
<transcript>: Just start this off, right.

00:25:34
<transcript>: We did a thing.

00:25:34
<transcript>: we

00:25:35
<transcript>: We.

00:25:36
<transcript>: Use.

00:25:36
<transcript>: what's it called

00:25:37
<transcript>: What's it called.

00:25:40
<transcript>: We used a Google.

00:25:44
<transcript>: Do I want to restore? Not, no.

00:25:50
cowfacedude99: and you should go through your twitter/google/github sso stuff....

00:25:53
<transcript>: Get out of here. Doxing doxing so much. Doxing. Oh, it hurts. It Tanz got fixed. That.

00:25:53
<transcript>: we used

00:25:55
<transcript>: We used a Google Colab.

00:25:55
<transcript>: full

00:25:57
<transcript>: Fullab.

00:25:57
<transcript>: during

00:26:06
totorayn: !os

00:26:08
<transcript>: During the stable diffusion. So we did this, but guess what? We couldn't build out stuff on AWS. Because I did not have in the account that I want to use it's got a bunch of credits I didn't have.

00:26:21
<transcript>: The quoteas to use GPU instances, but now I do. I can spin up to ten of them so we could start building some load balanced GPU stuff.

00:26:21
<transcript>: and that's what i

00:26:21
schrew: Gm Adam!

00:26:23
<transcript>: And that's what I want to do. I want to build.

00:26:27
<transcript>: Just reading a text from my wife 1 second.

00:26:30
<transcript>: Okay.

00:26:30
<transcript>: i

00:26:36
<transcript>: I want to build an API for training a subject in Dream Booth flat rate.

00:26:36
<transcript>: super

00:26:46
cowfacedude99: @macmike69 that sounds cool

00:26:52
<transcript>: Super fast at any scale. And I want to serve all these apps. People are building all these apps and they can't handle the they can't figure out how to do the infrastructure part of it. Or maybe they'll figure it out. But it's a painful thing to figure out. And I feel like it should just be a thing, an API.

00:26:52
<transcript>: and

00:27:02
<transcript>: And I'm gonna build that API if for no other reason. I'm probably not gonna commercialize it, but I just want to learn. I want to play with this stuff. You know, I'm saying so it's gonna be like a dream boost as a service.

00:27:02
<transcript>: for all the people

00:27:10
<transcript>: For all the people who want to build Dream Booth apps because there's a lot of them. They're happening fast. True is here. Good morning. Shrew.

00:27:12
<transcript>: Alright. Here's.

00:27:22
<transcript>: So I had a.

00:27:28
<transcript>: Cdk. Yeah, this is it.

00:27:31
neondactyl: How's the internet out in nixa? I'm also a fullstack engineer working from home, vaguely looking at moving somewhere new-ish

00:27:34
<transcript>: I got to update my Endem. I got some stuff going on.

00:27:38
<transcript>: Stable of fusion. What is that.

00:27:41
<transcript>: We built out a basic stack.

00:27:44
<transcript>: Like this.

00:27:57
2dorkstv: @neondactyl asking the right questions :D.

00:28:02
<transcript>: So I thought I said, oh, yeah, yeah. Here we go. Add capacity. So instant Type G, Five, Eight XL. I don't think that's the instance, if we actually want.

00:28:08
<transcript>: Let's do this. Aws.

00:28:11
<transcript>: Ecs.

00:28:11
<transcript>: g

00:28:13
<transcript>: Gpu.

00:28:13
<transcript>: based images

00:28:14
<transcript>: Based images.

00:28:14
<transcript>: we have to pick

00:28:15
neondactyl: @2DorksTV that's a make or break for me when looking at literally anywhere lol

00:28:21
<transcript>: We have to pick a base image. We got to write a Docker file. Did I already start one? Yes, I did. Or I stole one from something.

00:28:25
macmike69: @cowfacedude99 thanks, haven't started the coding yet, just working on the presentation board

00:28:26
<transcript>: New and mini Conda. Okay, so we're gonna have a different base image, image.

00:28:26
<transcript>: it's going to

00:28:29
<transcript>: It's going to be one of these deeply container images.

00:28:49
<transcript>: Neon Dr. Hausy internet out Nixa. I'm also a fullsecond engineer working from home, vaguely looking at moving somewhere newish. So here in my neighborhood in Nixa, we've got one gigabit symmetric up and down fiber to my closet. So 5ft away from me. I have a server rack with all of my network.

00:28:49
<transcript>: equipment

00:28:50
neondactyl: love it

00:28:53
<transcript>: Equipment and like storage and whatever.

00:28:57
<transcript>: And the fiver terminates literally in that cabinet.

00:28:57
<transcript>: i didn't know

00:29:03
<transcript>: I didn't know this was the thing. It's not even just fiber to the premise. It's not like to the outside of my house. It is inside my house.

00:29:03
<transcript>: the fiber

00:29:07
<transcript>: The fiber pretty great. Never had an issue.

00:29:07
<transcript>: it's pretty great

00:29:09
<transcript>: It's pretty great.

00:29:15
2dorkstv: Gigagbit is getting more common in more places, as long as its even vaguely populated

00:29:18
<transcript>: And now there's probably lots of places in Nixa that have terrible Internet. They're using dial up or something. I don't know. But here in this neighborhood, it's fantastic.

00:29:24
tom1269_: Flex LUL

00:29:29
vim_cerf: Fibre in the wall is the best! So so nice to use your own router.

00:29:29
<transcript>: Gigabit is starting getting more common in more places as long as it's even vaguely populated.

00:29:29
<transcript>: yeah no that

00:29:32
<transcript>: Yeah, no, that was a Flex, huh? Also, welcome to chat.

00:29:32
<transcript>: that's an intern

00:29:36
<transcript>: That's an Internet Flex. There's fiber in my closet.

00:29:45
miwivon: You might've heard this a lot of times but that keeb sounds really good, hope to get the Sonnet someday

00:29:55
<transcript>: Yeah, I think I'm actually using the ISPs router so I'm not as cool them surf is you are I don't get to use mountain router. Oh, I guess I use my own router. I don't use my own modem. They provided the modem and I don't care.

00:29:57
2dorkstv: I came from a pretty rural place and they just got 2GB. Kind of blew my mind

00:30:03
<transcript>: That keeps sounds really good. Yes, the son. It does sound really good, but I'm gonna let you in a little secret.

00:30:03
<transcript>: miwi

00:30:05
<transcript>: Miwi.

00:30:07
jamdotexe: Yea, we got fibre to the wall here

00:30:09
neondactyl: fiber modems are completely new to me honestly lol

00:30:20
cowfacedude99: Did you wire up your house for Ethernet?

00:30:23
<transcript>: A lot of people like the sound of my Sonet, those same people like the sound of my 80. And granted, they're very similar keyboards made by the same people. They even did all the looping and all that. So like, they do sound great. I think half of it is just having a good shotgun mic. Like a lot of people talk into, like, a condenser mic.

00:30:23
<transcript>: like one of these guys

00:30:24
<transcript>: Like one of these guys.

00:30:24
<transcript>: a lot

00:30:31
<transcript>: A lot of people use something like that. And that's not picking up your keyboard. But, you know, it is shocking. Mike.

00:30:31
<transcript>: especially

00:30:39
<transcript>: Especially positioned just so so it's pointing down at your chest, picking up all the sounds right in front of you. That makes half the sound.

00:30:49
<transcript>: Did you wire up your house for Ethernet? You know I did calf a well.

00:30:54
<transcript>: I didn't do it. I asked Mileageians to wire the house.

00:30:54
<transcript>: for

00:31:00
<transcript>: For Ethernet so there is Ethernet cable running to all the rooms in the house.

00:31:00
<transcript>: they used

00:31:06
<transcript>: They used like Cat Five, not even like Cat Five, e. I'm pretty sure just Cat five. Like.

00:31:06
<transcript>: i should

00:31:10
<transcript>: I should have. I should ask questions. I live in the Ozarks.

00:31:10
<transcript>: tech liter

00:31:13
<transcript>: Tech literacy low very low.

00:31:13
<transcript>: and i

00:31:21
<transcript>: And I just assume when I say, run cat, run network cables that they would run like something modern that can handle the bandwidth.

00:31:21
<transcript>: that

00:31:22
neondactyl: @adamdotdev that's abhorrent, cat5 is terrible

00:31:26
<transcript>: That we use these days, but they use this low grade nonsense, so don't even use it.

00:31:28
2dorkstv: ah man, sorry @adamdotdev

00:31:29
<transcript>: Yeah. Caviar is terrible.

00:31:29
<transcript>: i

00:31:32
cowfacedude99: that's old.

00:31:38
<transcript>: I what I did, though, is I ran my own run into my office, so I'm like, ten gigabit Ethernet. Here to my Mac studio.

00:31:38
<transcript>: because

00:31:47
<transcript>: Because I just ran my own cable into the office or into the closet because I'm right next to it. But everywhere else in the house has a bunch of garbage. Cat five. Okay, what was I doing? Deep Learning Container images.

00:31:47
<transcript>: that's what i was

00:31:50
cowfacedude99: 6e?

00:31:52
neondactyl: I'm partially wired for ethernet, aka cat6 from my switch in the basement only to my office in the house

00:31:55
stroopwafel26: The Mac Studio in your studio?

00:31:56
<transcript>: That's what I was doing. They have a list. Here they are. I've got to pick the right one, and we're gonna build we're gonna get a container running on Fargate.

00:31:56
<transcript>: no not on fr

00:31:57
2dorkstv: did they at least run it in conduit so you could upgrade it?

00:31:59
<transcript>: No, not on Fragate. They don't have Fargate support yet.

00:31:59
<transcript>: on

00:32:01
<transcript>: On ECS.

00:32:01
<transcript>: that

00:32:05
<transcript>: That can build a dream Booth model. That's the goal.

00:32:08
<transcript>: You're gonna need a Larabar if I'm gonna do it.

00:32:10
<transcript>: I.

00:32:20
<transcript>: Know it's fine. I don't like there are devices I would have plugged in if we had good Ethernet.

00:32:21
<transcript>: But.

00:32:21
<transcript>: the wire

00:32:26
<transcript>: The wireless is really fast. I don't know. I use like ubiquity stuff and the access points.

00:32:26
<transcript>: or wifi

00:32:34
<transcript>: Or WiFi six or whatever. So we get like 2300 Meg on WiFi, even like the Imac is just WiFi upstairs.

00:32:34
<transcript>: and it's still the sign

00:32:35
<transcript>: And it's still the sign.

00:32:35
<transcript>: but yeah

00:32:39
<transcript>: But yeah, I would have preferred to have wired.

00:32:47
<transcript>: Cat six. From your switch to the basement only to or in the basement. Only to my office. In the house. Yeah.

00:32:47
<transcript>: that's just

00:32:55
<transcript>: That's just like me partially wired the Mac studio in my studio. That's my Stroop. Did they at least run it in conduit so you could upgrade it.

00:32:55
<transcript>: no

00:33:01
<transcript>: No to dorks. They didn't. I had the worst electric. I'm gonna say this because they're not gonna ever watch my stream. I don't think.

00:33:01
<transcript>: i had terrible

00:33:14
<transcript>: I had terrible electricians in this house. It was a big bummer. We worked with a builder, and we just kind of used all his subs. And we had we built another house in this neighborhood, like, eight years ago. We had great electricians. He was super, like, forward thinking.

00:33:14
<transcript>: thought of stuff

00:33:20
<transcript>: Thought of stuff. I would never think of that house was just prepped. It was ready for whatever we'd want to do.

00:33:20
<transcript>: and this

00:33:35
<transcript>: And this one, like every outlet. Not only did they not do anything that I asked him to do and I had to tell them things multiple times. But like every outlet is a little crooked, like they just couldn't even make something straight, which just bothers me. I have OCPD very into aesthetics.

00:33:42
<transcript>: Look, I'm complaining a lot today.

00:33:44
<transcript>: I love my house.

00:33:44
<transcript>: i don't think

00:33:45
oetziofficial: kruzChaos

00:33:48
2dorkstv: it's so hard to find people that really *try*

00:33:49
<transcript>: I don't think about how bad my electrician was ever. So it's fine.

00:33:50
cowfacedude99: ubi is pretty nice. especially the PoE stuff.

00:33:59
<transcript>: It really is too dorks it really is. When you find them, you hang on to them.

00:33:59
<transcript>: you

00:34:01
<transcript>: You keep them close.

00:34:05
<transcript>: You.

00:34:05
<transcript>: stuff has been good

00:34:07
<transcript>: Stuff has been good.

00:34:07
<transcript>: i

00:34:08
<transcript>: I.

00:34:11
<transcript>: Use it for everything and we've got it all over the place.

00:34:14
<transcript>: Alright.

00:34:17
<transcript>: So this is the Docker bottle.

00:34:20
2dorkstv: my in-laws had electrictians that ran new stuff and the electricians just cut giant squares out of the drywall and didn't repair it properly -_-

00:34:24
<transcript>: I think this Docker fire was meant to work. Yeah, yes. Sable diffusion. Oh, it's using the invoke.

00:34:24
<transcript>: ai

00:34:26
<transcript>: Ai.

00:34:28
<transcript>: What's this.

00:34:40
<transcript>: What happened here.

00:34:42
nate_codes: wait is alt-J royalty free...? Or do you have audio set up so that music doesn't go to vod?

00:34:42
<transcript>: A tree center. It.

00:34:53
<transcript>: Mentioned I hate Docker.

00:35:06
<transcript>: My inlaws had electricians that ran new stuff in the electricians just cut giant squares out of the drywall and didn't repair it properly. That's a bummer. That's a huge bummer. Nayt.

00:35:10
2dorkstv: docker specifically or just containerized stuff?

00:35:11
<transcript>: I have audio setups that doesn't go to the VOD. That's all.

00:35:13
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow. Mac, Mike, Mike.

00:35:22
<transcript>: Tudorcs. Just containerized stuff.

00:35:22
<transcript>: i just started

00:35:27
<transcript>: I just started imagining all the time I'm gonna be waiting for this new image to build.

00:35:30
<transcript>: And my CI CD pipeline.

00:35:31
<transcript>: And I got bones.

00:35:36
<transcript>: Okay.

00:35:43
<transcript>: Gotta pick a base image. I think we have the pietorch one. Oh, there's multiple pietors.

00:35:48
nate_codes: @2DorksTV we had plumbers do the exact same for our plumbing...huge holes of drywall I had to patch...but they at least gave a $2k discount for it LUL (we were trying to go cheap, and they were actually pretty awesome about helping us)

00:35:51
<transcript>: We'll probably just go with whatever the vanilla. Let's see, horror, vote.

00:35:52
<transcript>: Gbu.

00:35:52
<transcript>: python

00:35:56
2dorkstv: I'm all in openshift and kubernetes so there's no escape for me :D

00:35:59
<transcript>: Python three, eight. That's the only thing that's different from what I've seen with Dream Booth. It's all Python three, nine. But I think this will work.

00:36:07
<transcript>: This is for training.

00:36:08
macmike69: i have to go study for lingustics 😔

00:36:11
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

00:36:11
<transcript>: there's

00:36:13
2dorkstv: @nate_codes discounts are good at least!

00:36:14
<transcript>: There's our base image.

00:36:20
<transcript>: Now I'm.

00:36:25
<transcript>: Need to understand. How do I actually literally just paste it? Surely not right.

00:36:32
<transcript>: Docker file.

00:36:39
<transcript>: How do I use this in a Docker file.

00:36:54
<transcript>: Anybody know.

00:36:58
<transcript>: Verbose to add that whole URL.

00:37:00
<transcript>: It's like an ECR. Url.

00:37:00
<transcript>: i

00:37:04
<transcript>: I Maybe it's published as something else.

00:37:08
<transcript>: My kids are running.

00:37:12
<transcript>: They're running upstairs. It's loud.

00:37:18
<transcript>: Okay. I hate paywalls so much. I don't want medium plus or whatever it is.

00:37:20
<transcript>: Can I still just do this.

00:37:27
<transcript>: That works.

00:37:33
<transcript>: Look at that. They treat their.

00:37:38
<transcript>: They treat anonymous people better than they treat the people who have accounts.

00:37:38
<transcript>: so annoying

00:37:39
<transcript>: So annoying.

00:37:46
oetziofficial: kruzChaos

00:37:47
<transcript>: Okay, the doctor image from Nvidia. Kuda.

00:37:51
<transcript>: Oh, they not using any of the prebuilt.

00:37:51
<transcript>: am eyes

00:37:52
<transcript>: Am, eyes.

00:37:52
<transcript>: or images

00:37:54
<transcript>: Or images. It looks like not.

00:38:01
<transcript>: Look like they are.

00:38:03
usrbinboat: just switch the base domain to "scribe.rip" and you can bypass the paywall

00:38:04
<transcript>: Okay.

00:38:21
<transcript>: Just switch the base domain. Describe rip and you can bypass the paywall. Oh, interesting. Thank you for that user bin boat, and also thank you for the voice. Samuraan.

00:38:24
nate_codes: @2DorksTV Yeah my story was a bit of a bait, but we had pre-agreed to that...they come in and out to do all the plumbing work, and I can either repair myself or hire a contractor who'll be cheaper than their labor

00:38:29
<transcript>: Well.

00:38:29
<transcript>: let's see

00:38:31
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:38:36
<transcript>: Deep Learning containers.

00:38:40
<transcript>: Waiting for somebody to show me a Docker file that uses.

00:38:43
<transcript>: One of these as a base image.

00:39:09
<transcript>: All right, we're gonna try Shuffle today. We're gonna try and explore some other music in this playlist, but.

00:39:11
<transcript>: I don't know how good I feel about it.

00:39:18
<transcript>: Is there anything in here that says.

00:39:24
<transcript>: Construction.

00:39:44
<transcript>: So we have to like log into ECR. These are published in ECR.

00:39:55
<transcript>: The path to the Docker files follow a specific pattern.

00:40:01
<transcript>: Are they published.

00:40:07
<transcript>: That's the question.

00:40:15
<transcript>: Ah, thank you for the following.

00:40:29
<transcript>: Music? What do I have? Your running tests.

00:40:30
fisering1: Hi, what window manager are you using?

00:40:35
<transcript>: What? Did I just open this one. No.

00:40:43
<transcript>: I just open something. Now. Here we go. How to build custom Images we can easily customize both training and inference with deep learning containers. Add custom frameworks, libraries, and packages.

00:40:50
<transcript>: Docker files. Here we go. Take the base sensor build container. Yeah, yeah. We just literally say from that thing.

00:40:52
<transcript>: Such a verbose. Okay.

00:40:54
<transcript>: Fine by me.

00:41:02
<transcript>: Okay.

00:41:02
<transcript>: that's not going to be

00:41:04
<transcript>: That's not going to be on my clipboard.

00:41:04
<transcript>: of course

00:41:05
<transcript>: Of course.

00:41:07
<transcript>: Better idea.

00:41:13
<transcript>: Oh, what was it from.

00:41:13
<transcript>: from that

00:41:14
<transcript>: From that thing.

00:41:17
<transcript>: We did it.

00:41:17
<transcript>: from

00:41:19
<transcript>: From that thing. And then.

00:41:34
<transcript>: Shell bin bash. What does that do? Okay, that's like amid all the errors and stuff environment, Debbie and Frontend noninteractive. We're not using debians, so I want to say that's not gonna be there. Okay. Conda install Python, three, nine and condo clean.

00:41:44
<transcript>: Ai Conda install PyTorch 111 Portuguese. See, I think all these things already installed. So this is a little bit problematic.

00:41:56
<transcript>: The app is apt even like an Amazon Linux thing. These are based on Amazon Linux. Linux, right.

00:42:02
<transcript>: Amazon Linux is based on what.

00:42:08
stroopwafel26: yum

00:42:10
<transcript>: Not debbien.

00:42:10
<transcript>: it's based

00:42:11
stroopwafel26: it's RHEL

00:42:13
<transcript>: It's based on what it's based on.

00:42:18
<transcript>: What is that one? Rel. Yeah. Thank you.

00:42:30
<transcript>: Miseraine. Welcome to Chat. I'm using you by.

00:42:42
<transcript>: Yum install this stuff.

00:42:43
stroopwafel26: you need to change apt-get to yum but i would bet some packages are named differently

00:42:48
<transcript>: Also don't know the I want to use invoke AI.

00:42:52
neondactyl: Sounds yummy

00:42:53
<transcript>: Kind of think I don't.

00:43:18
stroopwafel26: larabars are yummy, supposedly

00:43:19
<transcript>: Is this the one I'm using.

00:43:34
<transcript>: My GPU.

00:43:41
<transcript>: This is not the one I'm using. Okay.

00:43:45
neondactyl: @stroopwafel26 My wife buys larabars, they're not bad

00:43:52
2dorkstv: I like larabars. RXBars are my jam though

00:43:56
<transcript>: Change app get to Yum but I would bet some packages yeah yeah for sure.

00:44:00
<transcript>: I Love Lara Bars Neon Dye Dactyl.

00:44:03
<transcript>: So our X bars.

00:44:03
<transcript>: i bought

00:44:10
<transcript>: I bought some. I think I bought some. Nate, because Nate said something on Twitter that they were better. And I'm maybe they aren't.

00:44:13
nate_codes: :D

00:44:16
<transcript>: If you eat the ones with egg whites, I am plant based and I don't want to just like.

00:44:19
nate_codes: Larabars > RxBars (texture)

00:44:20
<transcript>: I'm plantbased, like I just hate bringing it up.

00:44:20
<transcript>: i hate

00:44:23
nate_codes: ahhhh yeah then no RxBars

00:44:29
2dorkstv: I'm stevehnh on twitter. Nate and I were singing their praises ;D

00:44:34
<transcript>: I hate that like that. I hate bringing up that I don't eat animals. Why is that? Why should I feel bad bringing that up? I feel bad. Because every time I bring it up, it's like, oh, you just wanted to tell me you don't need animals. No, I just don't. And I don't. So.

00:44:34
<transcript>: if

00:44:35
2dorkstv: you do you, man!

00:44:38
<transcript>: If you ask me a question about whether I want to eat that animal, I'm gonna say no.

00:44:38
<transcript>: okay

00:44:39
nate_codes: You're fine you don't live in CA

00:44:40
<transcript>: Okay.

00:44:40
<transcript>: so

00:44:42
neondactyl: It's because of the stereotypes, all you vegans are the same Kappa LUL

00:44:43
<transcript>: So I eat plants. I don't need egg whites.

00:44:43
<transcript>: they kind of

00:44:51
<transcript>: They kind of gross me out. And I think that's probably why people like the other RX bars. I tried some of the plantbased RX bars.

00:44:51
<transcript>: they're lacking the

00:44:54
nate_codes: "plant-based" == "obnoxious" only because of Californians

00:44:57
nate_codes: Your welcome / I'm so sorry

00:45:02
<transcript>: They're lacking the binder. They need the egg whites. I think they're very crumbly and dry and not as good as Lar bars. But that's just comparing apples to apples. Plant based the plantbased bar.

00:45:10
<transcript>: So I don't fault you all for liking our X bars. I just. I don't think the ones they're plant based are as good as Larvars. That's all.

00:45:15
nate_codes: @2DorksTV hahah I thought that might be you when you just said rxbars XD

00:45:15
<transcript>: You're welcome. I'm so sorry. It's fine, Nate. It's fine. My kids like them.

00:45:15
<transcript>: so

00:45:16
<transcript>: So.

00:45:16
<transcript>: there's that

00:45:17
stroopwafel26: arch users are also all vegans j/k

00:45:18
<transcript>: There's that.

00:45:22
2dorkstv: I did the raw food thing for a bit and larabars were the only thing we could eat, I think

00:45:25
<transcript>: I thought that might be.

00:45:28
neondactyl: @stroopwafel26 hahaha yes

00:45:29
<transcript>: You and you said our X star. Oh, did you say it too.

00:45:29
<transcript>: wait

00:45:30
<transcript>: Wait.

00:45:40
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah. Two door. I'm sorry I missed it. Was it YouTube? Both of you said it, right. Okay.

00:45:49
<transcript>: Yeah, I know your avatar on Twitter Doodlex. I just didn't. I didn't remember. I did think two people told me. I just remember who.

00:45:56
<transcript>: It's because of the stereotypes. All you vegans are the same, I guess.

00:46:02
2dorkstv: lol I'm not after credit for it. Just joining in

00:46:10
<transcript>: I also feel like if I've been plant based for ten years, I feel like if you've been Playt based for ten years, you shouldn't have to be, like, held accountable for what the last five years have done to Veganism. I feel like in the last five years, people have gotten really obnoxious about it.

00:46:10
<transcript>: i

00:46:11
nate_codes: HIPSTER VEGAN ADAM

00:46:14
neondactyl: That's fair

00:46:16
nate_codes: "I did it before it was cool"

00:46:20
<transcript>: I've been doing it for a long time, and I don't do it to talk about it on the Internet. I do it for a lot of other reasons. For there. I did it before school. Now.

00:46:23
<transcript>: I'm hitting all the tropes.

00:46:23
<transcript>: did i

00:46:28
<transcript>: Did I mention I do cross at night already I don't work out. So there's that.

00:46:34
<transcript>: Okay. Do we think this is as good? Do we think this is a good Docker file? I should read what it does.

00:46:37
nate_codes: although CA Vegans *have* been obnoxious for more than 5 years...not to detract from your point or anything

00:46:40
<transcript>: It's not gonna work and convert it to work on.

00:46:41
<transcript>: Rail.

00:46:45
<transcript>: But what is this thing doing? It is.

00:46:54
<transcript>: Doing that hold more than one base image thing where it makes a thing and then it makes a different thing with it. I hate that.

00:47:01
<transcript>: So what are we getting here.

00:47:01
<transcript>: there's somewhere

00:47:03
<transcript>: There's somewhere I've got to actually download.

00:47:03
<transcript>: the

00:47:04
<transcript>: The.

00:47:04
<transcript>: the

00:47:08
<transcript>: The hugging face, weights, right.

00:47:11
<transcript>: I don't see that in here.

00:47:11
<transcript>: was that in this one

00:47:13
<transcript>: Was that in this one.

00:47:21
<transcript>: Wait a minute. What am I building? Exactly.

00:47:29
<transcript>: Okay.

00:47:29
<transcript>: well listen

00:47:31
<transcript>: Well, listen, listen. Here.

00:47:31
<transcript>: we got

00:47:36
<transcript>: We got to find some answers. I'm not moving very fast. Not a clock.

00:47:40
<transcript>: There's dream booth class.

00:47:40
<transcript>: you

00:47:45
<transcript>: You use on an AMD GPU. I don't even know what is a Tesla.

00:47:52
<transcript>: Tesla A 100 GPU is that an Nvidia or an AMD Card? Nvidia.

00:47:55
<transcript>: Cool, cool. Thanks to Follow Reacher.

00:48:01
<transcript>: Efficient Dream Booth versus Dream Booth Docker.

00:48:04
<transcript>: Discontinued.

00:48:23
<transcript>: Do I use the invoke UI thing? That's the question.

00:48:23
<transcript>: do i want to use

00:48:25
<transcript>: Do I want to use one of these olive. Allinone.

00:48:28
<transcript>: Allinone things.

00:48:34
<transcript>: Clean Doc. Ramage.

00:48:34
<transcript>: maybe i'll

00:48:37
<transcript>: Maybe I'll just build my own Docker file.

00:48:42
<transcript>: I'll just follow the instructions. So green booth.

00:48:44
<transcript>: Stable diffusion.

00:48:44
<transcript>: getting

00:48:46
<transcript>: Getting started.

00:48:48
laytanl_: heyo!

00:48:51
<transcript>: Which is fine, like the canonical part one.

00:48:51
<transcript>: we're gonna

00:48:55
<transcript>: We're gonna make our own our own Docker file.

00:48:55
<transcript>: since

00:48:58
<transcript>: Since we're gonna have to convert whatever we work with anyway.

00:49:06
<transcript>: I'm Xavier. Zoe, this is like the biggest.

00:49:08
<transcript>: One on GitHub anyway.

00:49:12
<transcript>: So let's just follow these instructions.

00:49:17
<transcript>: Thank you for the follows Ziper.

00:49:22
<transcript>: California Vegans have been obnoxious for more than five years. Not to try.

00:49:22
<transcript>: okay maybe

00:49:24
<transcript>: Okay. Maybe it's been longer.

00:49:24
<transcript>: i don't know

00:49:25
<transcript>: I don't know.

00:49:25
<transcript>: i don't live in

00:49:34
<transcript>: I don't live in California. So there's that I live in a place where it's very hard to only eat plants. The Ozarks. Not exactly a plant. Mecha.

00:49:37
<transcript>: Bunch of cows.

00:49:37
<transcript>: my

00:49:42
<transcript>: My wife's, dad, was the President of the Cattleman's Association in Missouri.

00:49:42
<transcript>: so

00:49:43
<transcript>: So.

00:49:48
<transcript>: So he's not exactly accepting of our dietary choices.

00:49:52
<transcript>: See LDM environment we've done.

00:49:52
<transcript>: this

00:49:56
<transcript>: This let's do from the original the original.

00:50:00
<transcript>: Stable diffusion.

00:50:05
<transcript>: Let's do this one.

00:50:05
<transcript>: no

00:50:06
<transcript>: No, this one.

00:50:13
<transcript>: So let's follow this for the other environment. I'm just gonna Am I gonna delete all this? I'm just gonna start from here.

00:50:21
<transcript>: Like we're just gonna put some space there, and we're gonna start writing right here.

00:50:21
<transcript>: so

00:50:23
<transcript>: So Conda.

00:50:29
<transcript>: Ldm.

00:50:29
<transcript>: so we need

00:50:31
<transcript>: So we need to clone this repo.

00:50:31
<transcript>: seem like a good

00:50:33
<transcript>: Seem like a good first step.

00:50:33
<transcript>: was this

00:50:39
<transcript>: Was this already? Cloning? Yeah. What are they doing here, conduclean. So they're cloning invoke AI.

00:50:43
<transcript>: Why are they doing it like this? They're just running one big thing. Okay.

00:50:43
<transcript>: i'm gonna

00:50:45
<transcript>: I'm gonna copy that.

00:50:45
<transcript>: type of

00:50:47
<transcript>: Type of.

00:50:47
<transcript>: that approach

00:50:49
<transcript>: That approach if you will.

00:50:53
<transcript>: We're gonna copy the approach, but we're gonna do some different things.

00:50:58
<transcript>: So that tree sitter error is bothering me.

00:51:01
<transcript>: We're gonna do like.

00:51:05
<transcript>: Get clone.

00:51:08
<transcript>: This thing.

00:51:11
<transcript>: Right.

00:51:11
<transcript>: then we're

00:51:14
<transcript>: Then we're gonna CD and disable the fusion.

00:51:18
<transcript>: Okay.

00:51:28
<transcript>: How are we gonna do the weights? Kind of just pre download them and put them. Yeah, we'll just put them in. Yeah, Yeah.

00:51:31
<transcript>: That should work right.

00:51:45
<transcript>: Things To Follow robate.

00:51:49
<transcript>: Leighton is here. Sorry I missed it late in. Hello.

00:51:54
<transcript>: A random Monday stream. We don't normally stream on Mondays. Today. We're streaming.

00:51:59
<transcript>: We go in to stable diffusion. Reset hard. Get config. What is all this about.

00:52:01
<transcript>: What is this.

00:52:01
<transcript>: why are they doing this

00:52:02
<transcript>: Why are they doing this.

00:52:07
<transcript>: Don't understand, but I'm gonna delete it.

00:52:07
<transcript>: how do

00:52:09
<transcript>: How do they do this post buffer.

00:52:11
<transcript>: I don't know.

00:52:11
<transcript>: okay

00:52:20
<transcript>: Okay, get clone go into the directory and then we do Conda invadate we need to create right.

00:52:21
neondactyl: @nate_codes I thought that was Canada vegans...I think I need more coffee

00:52:23
<transcript>: Right.

00:52:28
<transcript>: Convin, create.

00:52:35
<transcript>: And then the file is environment. Yaml what is in base? I don't know, but I'm gonna delete it.

00:52:41
<transcript>: And then conduct, clean, no, no, no.

00:52:45
<transcript>: Condo activate.

00:52:47
<transcript>: Okay.

00:52:51
<transcript>: Are we just assuming that's gonna work let's assume that's gonna work.

00:52:51
<transcript>: it's probably gonna work

00:52:53
<transcript>: It's probably gonna work. Let's try.

00:52:58
<transcript>: In fact, let's we can start testing this locally. I guess.

00:52:58
<transcript>: does that work

00:53:05
<transcript>: Does that work on a Mac? Can I just like use Docker to simulate this Linux environment? Probably.

00:53:11
<transcript>: Except my DPU is not an Nvidia GPU, so I don't know what that'll mean.

00:53:15
<transcript>: Don't know what that'll mean.

00:53:15
<transcript>: we're

00:53:17
<transcript>: We're gonna try and run it, though.

00:53:19
<transcript>: What do you think.

00:53:26
<transcript>: Canada began CA.

00:53:28
<transcript>: It's funny.

00:53:31
<transcript>: Okay. Well.

00:53:31
<transcript>: we're gonna

00:53:35
<transcript>: We're gonna hope we have all the Python and content.

00:53:35
<transcript>: contentor

00:53:38
<transcript>: Contentorch and Python stuff installed.

00:53:38
<transcript>: let's just

00:53:40
<transcript>: Let's just delete.

00:53:43
<transcript>: To the end of the file.

00:53:51
<transcript>: Let's try running this thing.

00:53:51
<transcript>: can i just

00:53:54
<transcript>: Can I just try running this Docker container? Is that craziness.

00:53:58
<transcript>: Does anyone remember how to use Docker.

00:54:01
<transcript>: Docker. Do I have it.

00:54:01
<transcript>: oh actually

00:54:05
neondactyl: docker build

00:54:08
<transcript>: Oh, actually have it running. Docker's running right now. Are you kidding me? I had Docker running on my machine.

00:54:08
<transcript>: unironically

00:54:09
<transcript>: Unironically.

00:54:15
<transcript>: What? Okay, well, what's the command for? I want to just, like, build this Docker file.

00:54:15
<transcript>: docker

00:54:17
<transcript>: Docker.

00:54:20
<transcript>: Run a Docker file.

00:54:24
<transcript>: Such as Nube such a container note.

00:54:27
<transcript>: So if I have a Docker file, how do I just like test it.

00:54:29
<transcript>: Just want to like, run it.

00:54:31
<transcript>: And test it.

00:54:38
<transcript>: So I'm running that stuff. Cloning a thing into the container. Build your image.

00:54:41
<transcript>: Okay.

00:54:41
<transcript>: and

00:54:42
<transcript>: And then.

00:54:47
<transcript>: And then we can create a container with that image. Probably.

00:54:47
<transcript>: probably

00:54:48
<transcript>: Probably.

00:54:52
<transcript>: This isn't gonna build, but we're gonna try.

00:54:56
<transcript>: Select. Here. Let's just say Docker.

00:54:58
<transcript>: Build.

00:55:01
<transcript>: Adam.

00:55:08
<transcript>: Okay. Let's do what it does.

00:55:13
<transcript>: Docker build requires exactly one argument. What do you mean.

00:55:13
<transcript>: oh

00:55:15
<transcript>: Oh, I forgot the dot.

00:55:21
<transcript>: No way. Me. No, Amy, no, Amy.

00:55:30
<transcript>: Stop. Can I connect to the Docker? Damon. Is the Dr. Damon running? I don't know. You tell me. Is it Dr. Start.

00:55:33
<transcript>: I don't know just make it set up Docker.

00:55:41
<transcript>: Probably not running. I'm just surprised that it let me like I didn't think the CLI even responded if it wasn't running.

00:55:41
<transcript>: there we go

00:55:43
<transcript>: There we go, we're booting up now.

00:55:45
<transcript>: Smith.

00:55:46
neondactyl: useradd -aG docker adam

00:55:59
<transcript>: User ad AG Docker Adam. Oh, do I need to oh, I need to like, if I want to use that prefix.

00:56:02
laytanl_: cli always works

00:56:02
<transcript>: Name Spacey looking thing. I have to like, add a user.

00:56:04
neondactyl: gotta be in the docker group probably

00:56:11
<transcript>: Got to be in the Docker group probably.

00:56:11
<transcript>: so i have to actually

00:56:18
<transcript>: So I have to actually name. Could I just like, let it do a random name? Want to just make a random name for my image if I don't specify one.

00:56:20
<transcript>: Maybe I'm okay with that.

00:56:26
<transcript>: And build the image from that file. Issue the command. Oh, there it goes.

00:56:34
<transcript>: To stop. Okay. So what? I just let it build just a.

00:56:38
<transcript>: Name is the name of the new image to be created. Okay.

00:56:39
laytanl_: yeah don't need a name

00:56:41
<transcript>: Well, that sounds like I can just do this then.

00:56:43
neondactyl: I mean to connect to your local docker daemon, your pc user needs to be in the docker users group I think?

00:56:44
<transcript>: Docker, build.

00:56:49
laytanl_: you can use the autogenerated id

00:56:50
<transcript>: Docker file.

00:56:59
<transcript>: To solve with front end Docker file failed to create LLB definition darker PAP parse error line four.

00:57:05
<transcript>: I made bad Dockers stuff. This is a bad Docker syntax or something.

00:57:05
<transcript>: i was getting

00:57:08
<transcript>: I was getting out installed in this base image.

00:57:17
<transcript>: Wait failed to solve with frontend Docker file I feel like it's some thing with my syntax.

00:57:18
neondactyl: nvm I was wrong, I don't know mac problems vs linux

00:57:22
<transcript>: Where did I? Where did I get this from.

00:57:27
<transcript>: I could, I guess I could not do this whole like Piping thing.

00:57:33
<transcript>: Autogenerated ID.

00:57:36
<transcript>: Don't need a name.

00:57:36
<transcript>: yeah

00:57:44
<transcript>: Yeah. I guess the problem is my syntax. Now it says, Get on line four. So this isn't working. This whole run.

00:57:44
<transcript>: in a

00:57:50
<transcript>: In a file thing. Thought this is the thing I could do because I saw it in.

00:57:52
laytanl_: I have never seen this syntax before

00:57:52
<transcript>: The dream booth thing.

00:57:59
aaronshunter: Came here for Adam. Stayed for the pizza commercial.

00:58:00
<transcript>: Booth. Dr. File. Did I not see somebody do it this way.

00:58:03
<transcript>: See here.

00:58:17
<transcript>: Like, Why is that so different? What are they doing.

00:58:25
<transcript>: I guess we could just do it the old fashioned way, where we run these all as individual commands. Right.

00:58:38
<transcript>: The original Docker file.

00:58:43
<transcript>: That I was playing with Efficient dream booth. Here we go.

00:58:55
<transcript>: You got a pizza commercial. Aaron Center.

00:58:55
<transcript>: sorry

00:58:57
<transcript>: Sorry about that.

00:59:02
<transcript>: Yeah, I've also never seen this syntax before.

00:59:06
<transcript>: Laden. Here. It is. No, it's not. This is not it.

00:59:11
<transcript>: Somebody show me wait I thought I was.

00:59:11
<transcript>: fishing oh that just

00:59:14
<transcript>: Fishing. Oh, that just rewrite. That just redirects.

00:59:17
<transcript>: Where did I get that original Docker file from.

00:59:31
<transcript>: The.

00:59:35
<transcript>: Okay. Looks like we're just going to be doing the.

00:59:42
<transcript>: Separate commands.

00:59:42
<transcript>: okay

00:59:44
<transcript>: Okay, run.

00:59:47

01:00:53
<transcript>: Hereadox.

01:01:01
<transcript>: Oh, oh, here we go? So what did I do wrong.

01:01:03
neondactyl: <<EOF [commands] EOF

01:01:06
<transcript>: With all out of the way we can use heredog if you have two commands in the same run.

01:01:07
<transcript>: In the file.

01:01:07
<transcript>: what i did wrong

01:01:09
<transcript>: What I did wrong.

01:01:13
<transcript>: Literally what I just had.

01:01:16
<transcript>: Is it.

01:01:16
<transcript>: do you have

01:01:21
<transcript>: Do you have some special feature turned on for your Docker files to support that.

01:01:30
<transcript>: Let's see if this works.

01:01:42
<transcript>: Failed to solve with friend and darker foul filter create LLB definition I expect your status code.

01:01:42
<transcript>: unauthorized

01:01:49
<transcript>: Unauthorized. Oh, so in order to use this ECR, we gotta log into ECR or something. I've seen this before.

01:01:52
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:01:56
<transcript>: Deep learning Containers So, ECR.

01:02:11
<transcript>: I need to.

01:02:15
<transcript>: Log into ECR.

01:02:20
<transcript>: Account ID.

01:02:28
<transcript>: And then Region and Repository name.

01:02:30
neondactyl: time to change overlay and not dox :)

01:02:31
<transcript>: Wait. What.

01:02:34
thdxr: open adam's stream, first thing I hear "log into ecr"

01:02:38
thdxr: sounds bad

01:02:43
<transcript>: So this is how to build and test the DLCs on the platforms.

01:02:46
<transcript>: Sage Maker EC, Two ECS and EKS.

01:02:51
<transcript>: Access to an A device account. Yeah, I've got that.

01:02:53
<transcript>: Let's just make sure actually.

01:02:59
laytanl_: Running this would be very resource intensive, right?

01:03:01
<transcript>: One.

01:03:07
<transcript>: I have to create an ECR repository.

01:03:09
<transcript>: Do I.

01:03:12
<transcript>: In order to use these base images.

01:03:18
laytanl_: need like a terabyte of ram LUL

01:03:25
<transcript>: Okay. Well, we'll just do as I said.

01:03:25
<transcript>: i guess

01:03:26
<transcript>: I guess.

01:03:34
<transcript>: This is gonna take me straight to the page. I can just do it in the CLI or in the console.

01:03:43
<transcript>: Does sound bad, doesn't it.

01:03:48
<transcript>: We're doing stuff with Dream Booth, tax.

01:03:59
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm not sure, Leighton. I'm not sure that it would need to terabyte of Ram. It's gonna need a lot of Ram. I've got like, 64 gigs of Ram, though.

01:04:05
<transcript>: Okay. We want to let's just go into a Tobs console.

01:04:08
<transcript>: Look at this. Dax. We're going into the car.

01:04:08
<transcript>: we're doing stuff

01:04:10
<transcript>: We're doing stuff with ECR.

01:04:13
<transcript>: What is going on.

01:04:15
thdxr: wow

01:04:17

01:04:27
<transcript>: I started recording a video. Dax this morning. Like about serverless. It's clearing the air on some sort of misconceptions. I didn't finish it now. I don't know if I even want to do it.

01:04:29
<transcript>: But.

01:04:52
<transcript>: It's maybe my first database account.

01:04:58
<transcript>: And it has a ton of credits on it because they're like tied to my email address or something.

01:04:58
<transcript>: and i want

01:05:01
thdxr: ah

01:05:04

01:07:52
<transcript>: And then Docker login username AWS. I guess that's just like the default.

01:07:55
neondactyl: @laytanl_ just make the changes you want, that's the awesomesauce of open source :)

01:08:00
<transcript>: Don't touch that. Okay. Account ID this I am going to do like this. What is my account.

<transcript>: When I logged in that I changed the name of the.

01:08:57
<transcript>: Username AWS, password.

01:08:57
<transcript>: where does it

01:09:02
<transcript>: Where does it have the name of the ECR Repository? I thought I would have to specify that somewhere.

01:09:08
<transcript>: Like Where's your repository name used here.

01:09:12
<transcript>: Nowhere.

01:09:15
<transcript>: I logged in.

01:09:19
<transcript>: Did I log into the right U. S. East, one.

01:09:31
<transcript>: Then why do I need to name it Beta MXNet training.

01:09:36
<transcript>: Don't understand.

01:09:37
shiftlessatol: you can copy your URI which has extra cdk details on it?

01:09:38
<transcript>: My name.

01:09:50
<transcript>: Self hosting your Bitwarden sounds hard.

01:09:53
<transcript>: Yeah. Grass. New job. I'll talk about it soon.

<transcript>: i'll talk about

01:09:55

01:10:09
<transcript>: Taylor coming in hot with the guests. Okay, it's not a guest. I said it on my last stream.

01:10:18
neondactyl: It's hella easy, use a default dockerfile, and nginx proxy pass to the docker container :)

01:10:19
<transcript>: I forgot I said it when I had trashed up on yeah, I'm going back to status. I'll talk about it more later. I just I can't talk about too much yet because there's some stuff that's still in flight.

01:10:19
<transcript>: and

01:10:22
<transcript>: And mostly I haven't met with the team yet.

01:10:22

01:10:32
<transcript>: dave what are you talking about

01:10:35
<transcript>: Dave, what are you talking about? We talk about my Uri.

01:10:42
<transcript>: It's Easy is a default Aqua file in NGINX proxy path to the Docker container. That sounds not easy.

01:10:42
<transcript>: thanks

01:10:42
thdxr: adam got hired as a junior engineer at statmuse

01:10:44
<transcript>: Thanks for following midnight. Hayes.

01:10:48
<transcript>: What am I doing.

01:10:49
laytanl_: You founded that company right

01:10:49
shiftlessatol: on your AWS there's a copy feature

01:10:53
<transcript>: I'd logged into Docker.

01:10:53
<transcript>: or i logged

01:10:53
nate_codes: Hello Mr. Streamer have you tried doing better? I've heard that helps...

01:10:56
<transcript>: Or I logged into the ECR repository.

01:10:56
<transcript>: but i'm not

01:11:00
<transcript>: But I'm not trying to use that one. I'm trying to use their public, like.

01:11:00
<transcript>: right

01:11:01
shiftlessatol: you manually created most of the URI

01:11:03
<transcript>: Right. They've got these.

01:11:06
<transcript>: Deep Learning Containers this list.

01:11:06
<transcript>: right

01:11:08
<transcript>: Right here.

01:11:10
<transcript>: Nope.

01:11:10
<transcript>: yes

01:11:11
<transcript>: Yes.

01:11:18
<transcript>: The following table is the Docker image URLs that you use by Amazon ECS in Task definitions. Oh.

01:11:20
<transcript>: Wait.

01:11:33
<transcript>: So these only work ICS. I can't turn training information on deep learning stage for ECS using PyTorch blah blah blah ECS tutorials. Okay, that's where we're at. I guess that's where we're at people.

01:11:33
<transcript>: we're

01:11:36
<transcript>: We're looking at ECS tutorials.

01:11:42
<transcript>: For Shines following tutorials complete the steps in Amazon ECS setup.

01:11:50
nate_codes: See just like I said? Do the same thing you were doing...but better... :taps forehead:

01:11:51
<transcript>: So these aren't just base images I can use? Are they.

01:12:03
<transcript>: Not just published on Docker, can I look at, like AWS, Doctor Images published what's the Docker Repository called Pub published.

01:12:09
grasp5533: How do we feel about overemployed here?

01:12:12
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, I did. Oh, I see shift. Yeah, I see, Dave. I did copy that. I copied the account ID. That was all I copied manually.

01:12:17
<transcript>: Hello, Mr. Streamer. Have you tried doing better? I've heard that help.

01:12:28
<transcript>: Yeah, Leighton, it's. I still started it like eight years ago with the lifelong friend of mine. We started sat me back in 2014.

01:12:31
<transcript>: And I'm going back. I've been gone for three years.

01:12:34
<transcript>: And I'm gonna.

01:12:37
<transcript>: Share more about what I'm gonna be doing there.

01:12:43
<transcript>: See, just like I said, do the same thing you were doing, but better.

01:12:53
<transcript>: How do we feel about overemployed here? You know I've been I have thoughts on overemployed I've been seeing some news articles from people about like.

01:12:53
<transcript>: engineers

01:12:55
laytanl_: isn't there a URI for your ECR repository in the AWS console? which you should use in the dockerfile?

01:12:55
<transcript>: Engineers are working more than one job.

01:12:55
<transcript>: and

01:12:57
<transcript>: And.

01:12:57
<transcript>: the

01:13:01
nate_codes: @Grasp5533 as a concept or the .com website?

01:13:05
<transcript>: The remote work from home movement is created an environment. I've seen those articles. I have all kinds of thoughts. Does anyone in Chat have thoughts.

01:13:14
thdxr: overemployed is just consulting lol

01:13:16
<transcript>: Isn't there a Uri for ECR repository in the A Tobis console, which you should use in the Docker file. Oh, well, yeah, but I'm trying to use public ones, so here's what I'm trying to find.

01:13:16
<transcript>: where

01:13:20
grasp5533: @Grasp5533 all of the above

01:13:27
<transcript>: Where does Amazon has some, like actual official. Let's see. Docker Doctor Hub. Is that what it's called? Docker Hub? It'd be US official.

01:13:27
<transcript>: images

01:13:28
<transcript>: Images.

01:13:30
<transcript>: Is it called Backer hub.

01:13:33
<transcript>: They have Amazon, Linux.

01:13:33
<transcript>: but like

01:13:41
<transcript>: But like, they post, they publish a bunch of these. And I just want to get one of the ones that's, like, published. You know, I'm saying a public one.

01:13:41
<transcript>: i

01:13:44
<transcript>: I don't want to do all this. I am nonsense.

01:13:46
laytanl_: oh you're using a third party base image, gotcha

01:13:50
<transcript>: Where does it show? Like other published from this person.

01:13:54
<transcript>: About Official images.

01:13:57
<transcript>: Aws.

01:13:59
<transcript>: How do I.

01:13:59
<transcript>: interview

01:14:01
<transcript>: Interview.

01:14:04
<transcript>: Here we go. Now we're talking.

01:14:09
<transcript>: Now we're gonna find some PyTorch AWS.

01:14:09
<transcript>: eye torch

01:14:10
<transcript>: Eye, torch.

01:14:10
<transcript>: or i'll search

01:14:12
<transcript>: Or I'll search a deep learning next.

01:14:14
<transcript>: Deep learning.

01:14:19
<transcript>: Yeah I really can't spell today deep learning.

01:14:19
<transcript>: no

01:14:21
<transcript>: No, no.

01:14:28
<transcript>: All these are notes.

01:14:28
<transcript>: bunch of notes

01:14:29
<transcript>: Bunch of notes.

01:14:29
<transcript>: so are they not

01:14:33
<transcript>: So are they not published them on Docker Hub. I'm getting the feeling.

01:14:42
<transcript>: Over employees is consulting.

01:14:46
<transcript>: That's basically my take, DAX.

01:14:48
ademoverflow: maybe you are looking for AMI instead of docker images ?

01:14:53
shiftlessatol: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/docker-pull-ecr-image.html

01:14:59
<transcript>: Like, just don't, just don't, don't get like a W two, and it's suddenly it's fine. Just like if you have a bunch of clients, that's normal. If you have a bunch of fulltime employers, people feel worse about that.

01:15:06
<transcript>: I'm quite sure I employed someone that was working multiple jobs at sat Mews.

01:15:06
<transcript>: i'm quite sure

01:15:11
<transcript>: I'm quite sure that. And here's some signs if you're an employer. Okay. Probably not a lot of people in here in my chat that are like.

01:15:11
<transcript>: coming

01:15:16
nate_codes: It's like, "did you sign a document legally promising you wouldn't do this thing? Oh then maybe don't do it"

01:15:22
<transcript>: Coming at this from the employment angle. Probably coming at it or from the employers side. Probably coming more from the employees side. But if you happen to be someone who employs people here's some signs. Hang on.

01:15:41
<transcript>: Adam Overflow. That is the coolest name Adam Overflow. Oh, it's not as I age. Am. It's a dim overflow. Welcome to my chat. I'm looking for an AMI. No, I don't want to do, like EC two stuff. I want to.

01:15:41
<transcript>: build

01:15:44
<transcript>: Build an ECS Fargate service.

01:15:44
<transcript>: i

01:15:46
<transcript>: I think.

01:15:52
<transcript>: About over employment.

01:15:54
<transcript>: And.

01:15:54
<transcript>: mess

01:15:57
<transcript>: Messing with Dream, boots.

01:15:57
<transcript>: over

01:15:57
laytanl_: something like this maybe https://github.com/anibali/docker-pytorch

01:15:58
adamdotdev: !topic talking about overemployment and messing with dreambooth

01:16:00
<transcript>: Over employment. Did I spell it right.

01:16:02
pogjar: what is public.dev?

01:16:03
<transcript>: So over employment.

01:16:06
<transcript>: Signs you may be hiring someone.

01:16:06
<transcript>: that is

01:16:11
<transcript>: That is overemployed. I mean, what is overemployed? I guess someone who has another fulltime job.

01:16:19
<transcript>: At company off sites. They refuse to be in photos if they refuse to have their photos taken.

01:16:19
<transcript>: chances are

01:16:21
<transcript>: Chances are there's a reason for that.

01:16:21
<transcript>: they might say

01:16:25
ademoverflow: yeah adem ! like Adam but in a more arabic / turkish fashion. I just discovered your channel :)

01:16:27
<transcript>: They might say it's because of personal security. And like, they just really they value their Privacy.

01:16:35
<transcript>: They have another employer, and they don't want that employer to know they were at the company offside or that they work for you at all.

01:16:41
lvl80dev: No, I value my privicy

01:16:41
oetziofficial: lol

01:16:43
nate_codes: If you're capable of managing multiple jobs effectively then you're probably making distinctly less money already by not consulting effectively and quadrupling your rate

01:16:51
<transcript>: It's not a big deal. But we had an employee who refused to be in photos to the point that, like, finally, somebody corralled them into some big team photos. There's, like, 20 of us, like, corral them in, like, under the shoulder, under the arm. And he literally when the photo was taken like this.

01:16:51
<transcript>: and maybe

01:16:57
<transcript>: And maybe maybe it is just personal, personal Privacy. Maybe I just don't understand Privacy.

01:16:57
<transcript>: i'm somebody who

01:17:01
<transcript>: I'm somebody who probably undervalues my Privacy.

01:17:01
<transcript>: i mean

01:17:04
<transcript>: I mean, I'm on Twitch, so like clearly.

01:17:06
oetziofficial: i value my kruzChaos chaos

01:17:09
<transcript>: I've never really understood why people get so worked up about their private.

01:17:14
invisibleprogrammer: Hey, I wonder, how it is possible to be over-employed. Is that legal?

01:17:18
<transcript>: I don't know. We use all these services. If you're not using all of them, then yeah, I guess you're taking Privacy service seriously. But if you use all these things.

01:17:18
<transcript>: how can you say

01:17:21
<transcript>: How can you say you care about Privacy anyway.

01:17:26
<transcript>: Yeah, this person. There was really no public trace that they were an employee of ours.

01:17:26
<transcript>: hell

01:17:28
<transcript>: Helltal sign.

01:17:28
<transcript>: but you know what

01:17:35
nate_codes: @invisibleprogrammer frequently it may be in violation of your terms of employment with one/more of your employers

01:17:37
<transcript>: But you know what? They did fantastic work. Don't regret employing them at all. They eventually moved on. And probably because they found another better second or third job.

01:17:37
<transcript>: totally get

01:17:39
<transcript>: Totally get it.

01:17:39
<transcript>: it's usually

01:17:49
<transcript>: It's usually people who are really good at stuff that work for multiple people because they can they can juggle it. And I don't know, I guess ethically. Like.

01:17:49
<transcript>: if you

01:17:51
<transcript>: If you tell.

01:17:51
<transcript>: each

01:17:51
nate_codes: "legal"... 🤷󠀂♂️ I'm not a lawyer

01:18:00
<transcript>: Each employer, you're giving them a certain amount of bandwidth during certain hours, and you're doing it for multiple companies. I guess that's where the ethical lines get their bad.

01:18:00
<transcript>: because i do

01:18:07
nate_codes: It's like, "did you sign a document legally promising you wouldn't do this thing? Oh then maybe don't do it"

01:18:16
<transcript>: Because I do see people defend the overemployment thing is like nobody complains when a waitress works three jobs to make rent. But we're complaining when software developers have multiple jobs. Well, it's different if, like you have multiple jobs where you say you're available from nine to five, whatever.

01:18:19
<transcript>: That's different.

01:18:19
<transcript>: but also

01:18:25
<transcript>: But also, yeah, just be independent. Be a consultant. And then it's normal. That's expected.

01:18:29
<transcript>: Okay. I don't know why I came over to this camera just to say that I really don't have a good take on this.

01:18:35
<transcript>: I wonder, how is it possible to be overemployed? Is that legal? I think it's legal.

01:18:36
schrew: my controversial(ish) take is that folks who suffer from depression often exhibit the same signs of overemployment

01:18:41
<transcript>: Level 80 Dev welcome to Chat. You value your private.

01:18:41
<transcript>: i

01:18:44
<transcript>: I guess some people do.

01:18:44
<transcript>: pog jar what do

01:18:47
<transcript>: Pog jar, what do public Dev? It's a side project. Mine.

01:18:47
<transcript>: it's a sign

01:18:53
<transcript>: It's a sign project that I've kind of abandoned, and I need to get back to eventually or sell it or something.

01:19:00
<transcript>: Like Adam, but a more Arabic Turkish Fashion Discovery Channel. Welcome Edmund.

01:19:04
<transcript>: I appreciate you hanging out.

01:19:04
<transcript>: yeah if you

01:19:05
pogjar: what does it do though? I can't see anything but sign up on the home page

01:19:13
<transcript>: Yeah, if you're capable of managing multiple jobs, Cecily, and you're probably making distinctly less money already by not consulting effectively in quadrupling your rate. Yeah, I think you can make more consulting in the first place.

01:19:17
<transcript>: Oh, Etsy if I use your chaos.

01:19:21
<transcript>: Okay.

01:19:21
<transcript>: it's like did you sign

01:19:23
pogjar: also, can I have a beta key? HeyGuys

01:19:23
shiftlessatol: I start consulting tomorrow!

01:19:25
<transcript>: It's like, did you sign a document legally promising you wouldn't do this thing. Oh, then maybe don't do it.

01:19:33
<transcript>: True, controversial ishtake that folks who suffer from depression often exhibit the same signs of over deployment. Interesting.

01:19:34
invisibleprogrammer: I wonder. Am I over-employed if I have one employer but I have 80 hours of work for a week ? :D

01:19:42
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't know. I'm not trying to advise, like I'm not actually trying to advise employers how to look for signs of overemployment.

01:19:42
<transcript>: i mean it

01:19:47
<transcript>: I mean it mostly is a joke like I didn't realize it at the time.

01:19:47
<transcript>: i

01:19:53
thdxr: funny to hear the lyrics in the background "I admit it I admit it"

01:19:56
laytanl_: !public

01:19:56
nate_codes: @Schrew oooh this is an interesting take....correlation w/ overemployment/job hoppers and depression / lack of fulfillment

01:19:57
daneoshiga: long ago I've used free time in my job to freelance/study, not even remote..

01:19:58
<transcript>: I really just thought it was a Privacy thing. But this employee later it occurred to me and people had kind of there had been murders that this person was working another job, and I was fine with it. Like they were great. They did a little.

01:20:01
<transcript>: They were like really good at what they did.

01:20:02
<transcript>: But.

01:20:03
thdxr: ARE YOU OVEREMPLOYED "I admit it I admit it"

01:20:08
<transcript>: Later, it occurred to me, like, oh, yeah. They never wanted their photo taken. I think that's what it was.

01:20:09
laytanl_: !beta

01:20:13
<transcript>: Funny who the lyrics in the background I admitted I admitted.

01:20:17
laytanl_: ok I forgot

01:20:19
<transcript>: Am I overemployed if I have one employer, but I have 80 hours of work for a week. Yeah. You're overemployed.

01:20:22
<transcript>: Dave, you're starting consulting tomorrow.

01:20:22
<transcript>: you can

01:20:26
<transcript>: You can have a beta key. Yeah, yeah. What does it do.

01:20:32
adamdotdev: !betakey

01:20:32
fossabot: Use beta key `adamisontwitch2` after signing up at public.dev.

01:20:36
<transcript>: Your personal site as a developer. So if you do beta key that'll give you the beta key you can use.

01:20:38
pogjar: thanks!

01:20:39
<transcript>: Okay.

01:20:46
<transcript>: Long ago, I've used free time and my job to freelance study, not even remote.

01:21:04
grasp5533: Also Adam, I just wanted to say the twitter posts on you building public.dev were helpful.  I liked seeing how you organized your appsync resolvers

01:21:06
<transcript>: Yeah. I think people do that in the office. I don't think that's unique to the remote thing. People seem to think it's the work from home revolution. I think it's been going on for a long time. I mean, how long is that subreddit? It been active there's like an overemployed subreddit that's been quite active for a long time. I don't think working from home.

01:21:09
<transcript>: Is the reason this is happening.

01:21:09
<transcript>: i think

01:21:15
<transcript>: I think it's just people don't want people working from home. So trying to find a way, like an excuse to get people to come back in the office.

01:21:24
<transcript>: So I'm going to say the Twitter post on you building Pubble Dev were helpful. Like seeing how you were in a Japstic resolvers. Hey, that's cool grass. I'll eventually be building some more of that kind of stuff on stream.

01:21:24
<transcript>: there's a couple

01:21:27
<transcript>: There's a couple things I want to build.

01:21:27
<transcript>: and

01:21:28
<transcript>: And.

01:21:28
<transcript>: just kind of

01:21:31
schrew: Correlation, and a lot of behavior quirks of overemployed folks overlap with depressed folks. (abnormal working hours, low productivity, social differences, etc)

01:21:31
nate_codes: I worked at Microsoft (AS AN INTERN) and read The Verge for 4-6 hrs / day at my desk and got a *great* review from my manager KEKW

01:21:33
<transcript>: Just kind of not been doing much with that stack lately, but I will be.

01:21:36
<transcript>: Okay, I guess.

01:21:36
<transcript>: i guess

01:21:41
<transcript>: I guess I guess we gotta figure out how to use these deep learning aims.

01:21:41
<transcript>: in our cdk

01:21:42
shiftlessatol: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/docker-pull-ecr-image.html

01:21:43
<transcript>: In our CDK project.

01:21:43
<transcript>: right

01:21:45
<transcript>: Right. Because we don't want to.

01:21:53
<transcript>: Let's search for this specific name.

01:21:53
shiftlessatol: do this what you want?

01:21:56
<transcript>: What's the name of it.

01:21:56
<transcript>: pi torch

01:21:59
<transcript>: Pi Torch training. Just do that.

01:22:01
<transcript>: Aws.

01:22:06
<transcript>: High Torch training.

01:22:10
<transcript>: This match. Really.

01:22:13
<transcript>: 10,000 Results. Are You Kidding me.

01:22:13
<transcript>: what

01:22:15
<transcript>: What, what.

01:22:19
<transcript>: Okay.

01:22:19
<transcript>: i'm gonna take that

01:22:24
<transcript>: I'm gonna take that as the there is not an AWS published.

01:22:24
<transcript>: pi torch

01:22:26
<transcript>: Pi Torch Docker image.

01:22:34
<transcript>: Okay. So we created this repository. I think that was pointless.

01:22:34
<transcript>: always

01:22:35
<transcript>: Always.

01:22:41
<transcript>: Use one of these.

01:22:41
<transcript>: one

01:22:43
<transcript>: One of these right.

01:22:49
<transcript>: So to run training and inference on deep learning containers for ECS using MXNet.

01:22:55
<transcript>: So here are your images.

01:23:01
<transcript>: Is it? Do I just.

01:23:07
shiftlessatol: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pre-built-containers-frameworks-deep-learning.html

01:23:09
<transcript>: This isn't like an ECS specific configuration thing. Is it like I can just put it in my Docker file, right.

01:23:14
shiftlessatol: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ecr-us-east-1.html

01:23:15
<transcript>: Ecr is a regional service in the image table contains URLs for US East One images to pull.

01:23:15
<transcript>: one from the

01:23:24
<transcript>: One from the regions. Visit previously and sort of region. You must log in to access the DLC image repository before pulling the image. Ensure your CLI is up to date using the steps.

01:23:31
<transcript>: And specify your region in its corresponding ECR registry from the previous table in the following command. This is what I just did.

01:23:31
<transcript>: it did not

01:23:33
<transcript>: It did not work.

01:23:38
shiftlessatol: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63440881/use-sagemaker-pytorch-image-for-training

01:23:42
<transcript>: You can then pull, oh, I have to pull the Docker image from ECR by running that. Oh, Oh.

01:23:45
<transcript>: Okay.

01:23:49
<transcript>: Is this it did we figure it out.

01:23:54
<transcript>: The yanket.

01:24:02
<transcript>: Docker, pull.

01:24:02
<transcript>: that thing

01:24:03
<transcript>: That thing.

01:24:03
<transcript>: did it work

01:24:05
<transcript>: Did it work? No.

01:24:05
<transcript>: head

01:24:06
<transcript>: Head.

01:24:06
<transcript>: no basic

01:24:09
<transcript>: No basic off credentials any login again.

01:24:12
<transcript>: Plug in again.

01:24:23
<transcript>: Head maybe I'd use the full URL. Maybe I just use the power.

01:24:28
<transcript>: What is all this.

01:24:32
<transcript>: Pipe.

01:24:35
<transcript>: Maybe. What do we think.

01:24:39
<transcript>: What do we think.

01:24:57
<transcript>: No pull axis nine for portion of pretoritz training does not exist or may require docket login.

01:25:00
<transcript>: What is the name of the container image? Is it up here.

01:25:00
<transcript>: i use

01:25:03
<transcript>: I use the names example URL.

01:25:11
<transcript>: Oh, here we go. Repository, name, image tag.

01:25:13
<transcript>: My what.

01:25:17
justincreateslive: I heard pytorch I am just learning machine learning. what are you building?

01:25:18
<transcript>: So it is that part that's our part name? Yeah.

01:25:22
<transcript>: Name of container image.

01:25:31
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:25:33
<transcript>: Correlation.

01:25:33
<transcript>: and

01:25:44
<transcript>: And a lot of behavioral quirks I've ever played. Books overlap with the press folks, abnormal working hours, low predictive, social differences, etc. Interesting. True. Very interesting. Thank you so much for the follow Justin Creates live.

01:25:51
<transcript>: Nate Codes work as a Micro Microsoft as an intern, read The Verge 40 Stars a day.

01:25:51
<transcript>: got a great

01:25:53
<transcript>: Got a great review from.

01:25:53
<transcript>: that's awesome

01:25:54
<transcript>: That's awesome.

01:25:59
<transcript>: Did this what you want. Let's see which one day the last one you posted.

01:26:03
<transcript>: Justin, welcome to Chat. You heard pietorch.

01:26:03
<transcript>: and you're just learning

01:26:05
shiftlessatol: all of them

01:26:10
<transcript>: And you're just learning machine learning. What do you building? We are trying to build some dream booth infrastructure.

01:26:10
<transcript>: i want

01:26:14
<transcript>: I want to see how easy it would be to build like an Elastic API.

01:26:14
<transcript>: for doing

01:26:18
<transcript>: For doing Dream booth training on subjects.

01:26:18
<transcript>: at

01:26:18
shiftlessatol: The first is exactly what you're doing now

01:26:25
shiftlessatol: the others are for pytorch training images

01:26:38
<transcript>: At scale because I think right now there's people cobbling together some apps that work with Dream Booth, but they have a hard time on the infrastructure side. And I think this is solvable with some basic AWS stuff. I just gotta figure out how to actually build the container first. And GPUs on AWS are not a thing. I have a lot of experience first is exactly what you're doing now. The others are for Pi Torch training images. Okay.

01:26:38
<transcript>: let's see

01:26:39
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:26:39
<transcript>: down

01:26:41
<transcript>: Down.

01:26:41
<transcript>: what you sent

01:26:42
<transcript>: What? You sent me here.

01:26:46
<transcript>: Age Maker Pietwart Image for training.

01:26:52
<transcript>: Run some like this. Get login password. Yep. That's what I did.

01:26:54
justincreateslive: sorry whats dream booth?

01:26:57
pogjar: is dreambooth the image -> image thing?

01:27:08
<transcript>: The image is hosted in ECR. So when you want to pull it, make sure you have the correct database configuration with your own Adbase account security tokens. You've heard a long command before pulling the image. Do I need to do that in my Docker file? Surely not.

01:27:08
<transcript>: abs

01:27:10
shiftlessatol: for pulling:: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/docker-pull-ecr-image.html

01:27:10
<transcript>: Absorb login.

01:27:19
<transcript>: No basic off credentials.

01:27:25
<transcript>: That was Sage maker.

01:27:28
<transcript>: For pulling.

01:27:38
<transcript>: Dream booth is the okay so stable diffusion is the open source like Dollar or midjourney.

01:27:46
<transcript>: Generate images from text inputs. Right. Dream Booth is a specific model of way to train.

01:27:55
<transcript>: Your model to, like, take a likeness of a person or an animal or something and place it into a lot of different contexts. Okay. So.

01:27:55
<transcript>: dream booth

01:28:07
<transcript>: Dream Booth makes crazy profile pictures really easy. And that's what it's good at. So, like, there's Avatars is avatars. Yeah. Avatar. Ai me. So this is Levels Peter. Levels.

01:28:10
pogjar: so this is the thing dannypostma and levels are using?

01:28:13
justincreateslive: ohhh thats cool

01:28:17
<transcript>: Has made this thing you basically can hand it 20 photos like here's some 20 example photos of him and it spits out him in different settings.

01:28:17
<transcript>: like

01:28:21
<transcript>: Like Cartoon hymns, whatever. It's really powerful.

01:28:21
<transcript>: and

01:28:25
<transcript>: And there's people building companies just on top of the open source model.

01:28:25
<transcript>: the hard

01:28:29
<transcript>: The hard part is when a thousand people sign up and they all want to generate.

01:28:33
<transcript>: Avatars themselves. You have to train.

01:28:38
<transcript>: Thousand individual subjects on Dream Booth and that's really hard. It takes a DPU.

01:28:38
<transcript>: it's very intense

01:28:41
justincreateslive: So I can make an awesome hinge profile using this

01:28:44
<transcript>: It's very intense in terms of the GPU requirements. To do it at scale is difficult, but.

01:28:47
<transcript>: Knowing it'll be a stuff is all about.

01:28:52
<transcript>: So this is what you gave me, Dave? No. Pulling an image.

01:28:52
<transcript>: per

01:29:00
<transcript>: Permission. Yeah, I should have that the pulled a Docker image from EAM is on ECR repository. So let's describe Repositories. Let's do that.

01:29:00
<transcript>: abs

01:29:02
<transcript>: Abs. Ecr.

01:29:04
<transcript>: Describe.

01:29:06
<transcript>: Repositories.

01:29:12
<transcript>: So this is going to be.

01:29:15
<transcript>: Yeah, those are CDK ones.

01:29:17
bheet: or buy a server

01:29:22
<transcript>: And then there's gonna be our dream booth one. I don't understand what having one of these, though.

01:29:32
<transcript>: Like these are provided by Amazon. They're deep learning deep learning images.

01:29:44
<transcript>: Or buy a server that's also an option beat but if you look like it Peter's tweet.

01:29:44
<transcript>: and

01:29:46
<transcript>: And Danny's.

01:29:48
<transcript>: Like they've had a hard time.

01:29:48
<transcript>: right

01:29:54
<transcript>: Right. They've had a hard time scaling once they had like that virality of people wanting to do this.

01:29:54
<transcript>: it's

01:29:56
<transcript>: It's not an easy thing. So then people are waiting.

01:29:56
<transcript>: a day to get

01:30:02
<transcript>: A day to get their stuff because you have a big cue and you're having to manually go through that queue or whatever.

01:30:08
<transcript>: Like just owning a single GPU server does not solve the problem. Here's the thing.

01:30:08
<transcript>: the

01:30:16
<transcript>: The these are like little web apps these people have built, and they've had a lot of instant traction on Twitter. But if somebody built like a mobile app.

01:30:16
<transcript>: that

01:30:21
<transcript>: That got any traction and you talk about the audiences on mobile apps for something like this.

01:30:21
<transcript>: if this thing

01:30:23
thdxr: u n i t e c o n o m i c s

01:30:34
<transcript>: If this thing ever if one of these apps ever had a real moment of virality, like on a large scale, not like Twitter, but like lots of people downloading some iphone app number one in the App Store kind of thing.

01:30:34
<transcript>: you're talking

01:30:41
pogjar: so you wanna build the thing that all of them will use

01:30:43
<transcript>: You're talking about a whole lot of GPU compute, and there's no way one server or even ten servers can accomplish that task. Not in a timely way. Does that make sense.

01:30:45
justincreateslive: it would break lol

01:30:47
<transcript>: You, Unit, economics.

01:30:53
<transcript>: You can make an awesome Hinge profile using this exactly.

01:31:13
<transcript>: Yeah, that's what Danny and Levels are using. Yeah, it's exactly right. They're using Dream Booth. That's what's funny is like entire businesses are being built on the open source libraries, and like, they're just literally slapping like a Web page on top of what is something that's been created in Open Source. Anyone can go make one of these models and train a model on their face. But it takes.

01:31:13
<transcript>: some technical

01:31:14
bheet: i see

01:31:30
<transcript>: Some technical knowhow. So that's where the business opportunity is like, we'll make it easy for normal people, just upload some photos, get some avatars and you have to write all the prompts, like they're doing a lot of stuff here. That's not trivial, but like the hard work. And they'll admit it was this open source effort. The dream booth was Google. And.

01:31:41
<transcript>: So Dream Business was actually a paper by Google. They built an implementation and then open source community, kind of reverse engineered it, made their own open source version. Okay, I'm talking a lot.

01:31:44
<transcript>: So you want to build the thing that all of them will use.

01:31:44
<transcript>: yeah

01:31:49
justincreateslive: So did avatarai add anything to Dreambooth ?

01:32:05
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't even know if I'm gonna, like, have anyone using it. I just want to, like, solve the infrastructure process and see how elastic a thing can you make for GPU training? The inference parts really easy. It's not as intense, but on the training side, like, what would an API look like? That allows you to take and create a new subject. Put 20 images that subject in and get out.

01:32:05
<transcript>: a checkpoint

01:32:08
invisibleprogrammer: I work for a company that just coupled together a tons of apache open source stuff and makes tons of money. People don't recognise the potential of open source

01:32:12
<transcript>: A checkpoint for the model. Like a checkpoint for running your inference with what would that API look like? How fast could it be.

01:32:12
<transcript>: because like you look

01:32:22
<transcript>: Because like you look at their products and they take I think they take quite a while to get back here. Let's see what Levels was doing now they're working on these feverishly. So it's changing every day.

01:32:26
<transcript>: It'll be about 3 hours.

01:32:30
<transcript>: Based on current waiting times.

01:32:30
<transcript>: so

01:32:31
<transcript>: So.

01:32:31
<transcript>: and that's probably

01:32:39
<transcript>: And that's probably a guess because he doesn't know what his cues are gonna build. He's got limited. I don't know what he's using. I don't know how he's doing his GPU.

01:32:39
<transcript>: compute

01:32:45
justincreateslive: I come from a mechanical background so Im building a robot and going to use ML to train the vision system and ML for locamotion

01:32:59
<transcript>: Compute. But he's got a limited resources here, right? Like a limited number of GPU instances available. So a thousand people sign up immediately. It's gonna be more than 3 hours. It's gonna take a long time. So how quickly is the model takes? I think on good GPU hardware. It takes something like 30 to 40 minutes to actually train a new subject.

01:32:59
<transcript>: so

01:33:05
<transcript>: So the 3 hours comes in when you've got a queue of people that want to do it and you're all trying to use the same GPU.

01:33:05
<transcript>: but

01:33:08
<transcript>: But what if you could elastically scale.

01:33:11
<transcript>: Horizontally, on demand.

01:33:11
<transcript>: that's the other thing

01:33:26
<transcript>: That's the other thing. That's the other thing. So I wouldn't be as interested in this if Fargate weren't about to add. I think it reinvent about to add support for GPU instances. Then you can actually scale down to zero and you've got this really elastic GPU farm. That's why I'm actually excited about it.

01:33:26
<transcript>: let's see

01:33:26
thdxr: oooo

01:33:27
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:33:31
thdxr: wow what a great usecase

01:33:39
pogjar: yeah this is really interesting stuff! cool project

01:33:40
<transcript>: Did Avatar AI add anything to Dream Booth? So I didn't. I don't think they add anything to Dream Booth, but they added, So what is he doing? He's training.

01:33:52
<transcript>: A new subject in Dream Booth. He even has the dropdown for like, these are like you have to choose a subject and then an instance of that subject. When you create a new model with Dream booth.

01:33:52
<transcript>: so

01:34:08
<transcript>: So he's doing that. And then I think he said he's got some automated or maybe manual review process that does some post processing on the images to like, maybe coal bad ones. So like even in his examples here, though, he's got some that look pretty wonky like what's going on here with his arm.

01:34:15
<transcript>: But he claimed to have some kind of, like post processing pipeline. So there are things you can do.

01:34:15
<transcript>: take one of

01:34:26
<transcript>: Take one of these images and use like textto image and refine or image to image and do refining to make the image high resolution things like that. So there's some other types of post processing you can do.

01:34:26
<transcript>: but yeah

01:34:29
<transcript>: But yeah, mostly they're building whole businesses.

01:34:29
<transcript>: on top of

01:34:48
justincreateslive: this is so cool

01:34:48
<transcript>: On top of just what is an open source library. It's like a huge goal rush moment in AI, where you look at like copy AI. They do, what a hundred K a month in revenue. They do inspect revenue for a tiny company that's really just you using GPT, GP, two CPT, three GPT.

01:34:48
<transcript>: gbd

01:34:50
bheet: royalties would be nice LUL

01:34:56
<transcript>: Gbd Three now actually they started building their own models so they might be completely on their own model now, but like the whole AI automated.

01:34:56
<transcript>: text

01:35:00
shiftlessatol: why not use this https://openai.com/dall-e-2/

01:35:09
<transcript>: Text writing thing with GPU Three. There's tons of businesses built on top of GPD Three, and they're doing just like the app part of it. And leveraging standing on the shoulders of these machine learning Giants.

01:35:09
<transcript>: that's

01:35:16
<transcript>: That's like a whole new industry for startups to just, like, pop up overnight because they get to leverage these amazing models.

01:35:20
<transcript>: I work for a company that just coupled together.

01:35:25
<transcript>: That's exactly right.

01:35:25
<transcript>: yeah we've been doing

01:35:28
<transcript>: Yeah. We've been doing it with Apache stuff for years.

01:35:28
<transcript>: i mean

01:35:32
<transcript>: I mean like that's like the whole.

01:35:32
<transcript>: story i mean eight of

01:35:35
<transcript>: Story. I mean, eight of us is built on so much open source stuff.

01:35:39
<transcript>: I come from a mechanical background. So I'm building a rope.

01:35:39
<transcript>: going to use

01:35:43
<transcript>: Going to use Ml to train the vision system and Ml for Locomotion. That's awesome.

01:35:45
<transcript>: That is super cool.

01:35:53
<transcript>: Really interesting stuff. Cool project. Yeah, it is cool. Royalties would be nice.

01:35:57
<transcript>: Thank you for the following King, Queen.

01:35:58
<transcript>: And Dennis.

01:35:58
<transcript>: right

01:36:00
<transcript>: Right on queue.

01:36:06
<transcript>: Why not use this Dolly too? So Dolly is not open source.

01:36:24
<transcript>: And I do I have access to the Dolly beta. I've played with it and it has good results for certain types of things. This are all different midjourney. I also pay for midjourning. It's just very different than Dolly. So do you give two different models, the same text inputs, and they're gonna come up with very different results.

01:36:31
<transcript>: But Dolly doesn't do likeness transfer in the way that Dream Booth does. So Dolly.

01:36:51
<transcript>: You try and go into Dolly. And like, I don't even think you can add reference images. I don't think you can say with Dolly, here's a reference image. Now understand it's likeness. And that's the unique thing about Dream Booth. In this particular implementation, built on top of stable diffusion, you can actually train it to understand someone's likeness. And then you can say, put that person.

01:36:51
<transcript>: in all

01:36:56
<transcript>: In all these different settings, all these different contexts. And that's what this is all about.

01:36:56
<transcript>: okay

01:36:57
<transcript>: Okay.

01:36:57
<transcript>: let's actually try and

01:37:08
<transcript>: Let's actually try and get something running, though. That'd be cool. Still haven't run a thing. So what am I trying to do? I'm trying to I want to be able to build an ECS powered API.

01:37:10
<transcript>: And to do that.

01:37:10
<transcript>: we're talking about

01:37:16
<transcript>: We're talking about what's the most efficient way to take advantage of GPUs in AWS.

01:37:16
<transcript>: the most efficient

01:37:19
<transcript>: The most efficient way would be to use these deep learning containers.

01:37:19
<transcript>: they're already

01:37:20
<transcript>: They're already like pre.

01:37:20
<transcript>: tuned

01:37:26
<transcript>: Tuned and honed to use things like PyTorch TensorFlow, MXNet.

01:37:26
<transcript>: these images

01:37:34
<transcript>: These images have all the wiring to like the right Kuda drivers and all that stuff, right. So what I want is to use.

01:37:34
<transcript>: one of these

01:37:39
<transcript>: One of these deep learning a mis, and we've been stuck here trying to just figure out how do I how do I do this.

01:37:42
<transcript>: So like these.

01:37:48
<transcript>: Container images. These are URLs to the images.

01:37:48
<transcript>: on

01:37:49
<transcript>: On.

01:37:56
<transcript>: Ecr, which is Elastic Container registry.

01:37:56
<transcript>: it's like

01:38:00
<transcript>: It's like the It's like the Docker hub. But for Amazon.

01:38:08
<transcript>: And I haven't figured out how to actually use one, like, in a Docker file. That's what I want to do is just.

01:38:11
<transcript>: Like use this as a base image.

01:38:17
<transcript>: Graviton. Graviton. Would be better if we could use Grab it on it's more efficient.

01:38:21
<transcript>: But.

01:38:21
<transcript>: i don't

01:38:25
<transcript>: I don't know. Those are all CPU. Okay, so no GPU on this.

01:38:28
<transcript>: Sage maker Triton.

01:38:32
<transcript>: Is there inference? We just I think we just want.

01:38:32
<transcript>: this

01:38:36
<transcript>: This basic training. Pi torch. Right here. Ec, two container.

01:38:36
<transcript>: we've past

01:38:39
<transcript>: We've pasted it up here. We seem to know.

01:38:39
<transcript>: this

01:38:46
<transcript>: This we can't just derive from that as a base image, at least not without some kind of special off situation.

01:38:54
<transcript>: What's going on here? Oh.

01:39:03
<transcript>: Docker pool. I couldn't just do that whole thing, could I.

01:39:03
<transcript>: did i try that

01:39:05
<transcript>: Did I try that already.

01:39:11
<transcript>: Let's do the login thing again.

01:39:14
<transcript>: That use east one.

01:39:19
<transcript>: And then Dr. Pull.

01:39:22
<transcript>: Oh, what did it do there.

01:39:27
justincreateslive: I read through the dreambooth doc you shared so is that open source ?

01:39:32
<transcript>: Back here.

01:39:32
<transcript>: okay

01:39:35
<transcript>: Okay, three, eight. What is this.

01:39:35
<transcript>: delete

01:39:37
<transcript>: Delete seven.

01:39:42
<transcript>: And it says no basic OS credentials.

01:39:50
andreccosta: is it because hosts dont match?

01:39:50
<transcript>: Use AWS Deep Learning images.

01:39:52
<transcript>: Locally.

01:40:12
<transcript>: Right to the Dream Booth Doc. You shared. So is that open source? Yeah. Dream Booth is not okay. So Dream Booth was written. It's like Google. Does these really cool Ml things. They put out a paper. They the one that it reminds me of is when they did Wave. Net, which is like speech generation. So they created this Wave. Net model.

01:40:16
schrew: (I've been in and out) have we run docker login yet?

01:40:17
andreccosta: 11971... vs 76310...

01:40:32
<transcript>: And it's a way of doing speech generation in this very crazy. So this gets away with machine learning. They put out the paper, they had a reference implementation, and then they use it commercially at Google for like all their speech APIs. But then the open source community tries to like deconstruct that and create an open source version. Same.

01:40:32
<transcript>: thing

01:40:37
<transcript>: Thing with dream booth. So Google put out the paper, had an implementation of it.

01:40:37
<transcript>: that was not

01:40:47
<transcript>: That was not open source. The open source community kind of reverse engineered and figured out how to make based on the paper an open source version. So there are a few different open source stream booth versions.

01:40:56
<transcript>: Is it because hosts don't match? I don't. Maybe. What's that mean? I've been in and out. Have we run Docker login yet? We have Shrew.

01:40:56
<transcript>: it did not work

01:40:57
<transcript>: It did not work.

01:40:57
<transcript>: i mean

01:40:58
justincreateslive: ahhh ok that makes sense

01:41:02
<transcript>: I mean, we logged in successfully, but I don't think that helps me pull these specific containers.

01:41:02
<transcript>: here we

01:41:08
<transcript>: Here we go. How to download deep learning standard images from AWS. V. A. Docker locally.

01:41:12
justincreateslive: have you ever made your own ML model?

01:41:15
<transcript>: No answers. Okay. Cool. Oh.

01:41:15
<transcript>: leave your final

01:41:17
<transcript>: Leave your final answer here.

01:41:20
<transcript>: For Sage Maker. This is one Dave linked.

01:41:20
<transcript>: oh wait wait

01:41:25
thdxr: aren't those images public

01:41:28
<transcript>: Oh, wait, wait. This one actually has a. Okay, pull the image. Pull. Oh, so I just need to leave the haha. No, that's what I did. Yeah.

01:41:33
<transcript>: That would I did.

01:41:36
<transcript>: Ekr.

01:41:36
<transcript>: that

01:41:37
<transcript>: That.

01:41:41
<transcript>: Py.

01:41:45
<transcript>: Please forget next night. And then the one dot three.

01:41:47
<transcript>: Yes.

01:41:50
<transcript>: I wonder if this.

01:41:50
<transcript>: zero

01:41:51
<transcript>: Zero.

01:41:51
<transcript>: four

01:41:56
<transcript>: Four. Ec two. Does that go away? No, I didn't go away.

01:42:04
andreccosta: match the hosts. looking at answers on stackoverflow that's the diff in your case.

01:42:06
<transcript>: I don't understand. These images are public readable so you can pull them from any Aubas account. I guess the reason you failed is that you did not specialize in your login. Oh Oh.

01:42:08
<transcript>: I didn't do this. Right.

01:42:14
<transcript>: Okay.

01:42:23
<transcript>: We want to do like.

01:42:29
<transcript>: We want to do like this.

01:42:33
<transcript>: Let's see oh, come on.

01:42:35
<transcript>: We want.

01:42:35
<transcript>: east

01:42:37
<transcript>: East.

01:42:37
bheet: LUL copy pasting is hard

01:42:39
<transcript>: One.

01:42:40
<transcript>: And then we want.

01:42:44
<transcript>: Register. These. That all.

01:42:51
<transcript>: Get login. It's missing. What? What.

01:42:51
<transcript>: get

01:42:55
<transcript>: Get logged in knowing including.

01:42:57
<transcript>: What is going on.

01:42:57
andreccosta: LUL

01:43:02
<transcript>: Registry IDs.

01:43:04
andreccosta: its missing chars

01:43:04
<transcript>: Why are all the G's missing.

01:43:06
<transcript>: Do you see this.

01:43:12
<transcript>: Region.

01:43:12
<transcript>: us each one

01:43:14
<transcript>: US each one. Okay. Does that work.

01:43:18
<transcript>: Why did I have it in the.

01:43:22
schrew: must not be a real G smh

01:43:26
<transcript>: Work? No. What did it do.

01:43:26
<transcript>: no including

01:43:31
<transcript>: No including Mel, is get login Redshare DS Region US East one.

01:43:34
<transcript>: What's it saying here.

01:43:46
<transcript>: Argument Invalid choice diet options are bad choices are.

01:43:46
<transcript>: okay

01:43:50
<transcript>: Okay. Let's just try typing this because I think.

01:43:53
<transcript>: Aws, ECR gets login.

01:43:57
<transcript>: No. Include email.

01:44:00
<transcript>: Registry IDs.

01:44:00
<transcript>: five

01:44:03
<transcript>: Five, 20. These do like.

01:44:03
<transcript>: their correct

01:44:04
<transcript>: Their correct 703.

01:44:04
<transcript>: six

01:44:06
<transcript>: Six, five.

01:44:09
<transcript>: 4638.

01:44:13
<transcript>: Region US East one.

01:44:21
<transcript>: Did the CLI change? Maybe. What's the let's see.

01:44:23
schrew: is it get-login-password now?

01:44:25
<transcript>: Is git login not even a.

01:44:25
<transcript>: get

01:44:27
<transcript>: Get.

01:44:27
<transcript>: i don't see

01:44:28
<transcript>: I don't see get login.

01:44:32
<transcript>: I don't see get login what's it supposed to be.

01:44:36
<transcript>: Get authorization token.

01:44:39
<transcript>: Get login password.

01:44:43
<transcript>: No.

01:44:44
schrew: check bottom right

01:44:48
<transcript>: Check bottom right.

01:44:49
bheet: scroll a abit

01:44:59
pogjar: aws looks complicated lmao

01:45:01
<transcript>: Copyping is hard. Match the host. Yeah, it is. The images are public. Dax, I don't understand why this is so hard.

01:45:07
<transcript>: Match the host looking at answers on stacker blow that's the diff in your case.

01:45:07
<transcript>: it's missing

01:45:08
<transcript>: It's Missing carriers.

01:45:13
schrew: idk why its not in order, but it's above help

01:45:14
<transcript>: Check bottom, right. Scroll a bit a BS looks complicated. Scroll a bit.

01:45:16
<transcript>: Currently that.

01:45:19
bheet: dockers is weird but handy

01:45:27
<transcript>: Doesn't mention the registry IDs option. Do I just need to do the do I need to actually do the login but include the registry ID. So earlier.

01:45:34
<transcript>: Earlier we did like this login right here. Do we need to just include Yay.

01:45:42
<transcript>: Yep. We're gonna do like this. We're gonna say.

01:45:46
<transcript>: Registry.

01:45:52
<transcript>: Was it redistry. Ids five to 0713.

01:45:54
<transcript>: Six, five, four.

01:45:56
<transcript>: Six, Three, eight.

01:45:56
<transcript>: we're gonna try

01:45:58
<transcript>: We're gonna try that.

01:46:06
<transcript>: Oh, no, oh, do I need to do equals no Registry IDs.

01:46:11
<transcript>: What's wrong here? Registry.

01:46:15
steffi128: You got a comma in there

01:46:16
<transcript>: Ids. Apparently that's not valid for.

01:46:20
<transcript>: What.

01:46:24
<transcript>: Got comments there do it really.

01:46:31
<transcript>: Where? Well, I don't. They said unknown options. They did that. But I didn't have a comment there.

01:46:41
<transcript>: This should not be the hard part.

01:46:44
<transcript>: Url for your devote Private Ridge.

01:46:44
<transcript>: that

01:46:45
<transcript>: That.

01:46:51
<transcript>: I just needed access to a public registry.

01:46:59
andreccosta: isn't "aws ecr get-login-password --region ${region}" enough there?

01:46:59
steffi128: Sorry, right. Not confusing at all, putting commas in the error message. LUL

01:47:03
ph208: What are you trying to do today?

01:47:07
<transcript>: Amazon used for a private street. What about public reader registries.

01:47:07
<transcript>: do we not

01:47:10
<transcript>: Do we not need to if they're public.

01:47:13
<transcript>: What are we trying to do? Ph. Great question.

01:47:17
<transcript>: Great question. We're trying to.

01:47:17
<transcript>: build

01:47:22
<transcript>: Build some GPU infrastructure for training open source.

01:47:25
<transcript>: Machine learning models.

01:47:58
ph208: Like google colab?

01:47:59

01:48:09
nate_codes: Hey Adam you're great

01:48:09
<transcript>: Get login pass so the register ID is replaced. The account.

01:48:17
<transcript>: Oh my God. Someone kill me. Now what is this? I switch the that from that.

01:48:17
<transcript>: switching to

01:48:18
nate_codes: I gtg but I hope the rest of your stream is awesome!

01:48:19
<transcript>: Switching to darker vials. Import into.

01:48:34
<transcript>: Hey, Adam, you're great. I gotta go, but I hope the rest of your stream is awesome. Thanks so much, Nate.

01:48:35
<transcript>: Breathe.

01:48:37
nate_codes: Also what software / tool do you use for virtual hats and accessories?

01:48:38
andreccosta: you dont need registry-ids in get-login-password apparently

01:48:43
<transcript>: Yeah, I like Colab, but where we can, like, build an API on top of it.

01:48:45
shiftlessatol: replace 119712928745 with the 520713654638

01:48:47

01:48:51
<transcript>: Hello.

01:48:54
<transcript>: Replace that with Oh.

01:49:04
shiftlessatol: and remove --registry-ids

01:49:06
<transcript>: You do? Okay. Yeah. So I'm supposed to use the public repository number instead of my account number is what you're saying to me, okay.

01:49:14
<transcript>: So here we logged in. Yeah. Hahaha. Okay. Actually.

01:49:16
<transcript>: Actually no.

01:49:19
<transcript>: Come on.

01:49:21
<transcript>: I don't care.

01:49:28
<transcript>: It's this one? But we're supposed to use yeah, Yeah.

01:49:35
<transcript>: So this one is supposed to be the it's this number.

01:49:39
<transcript>: Where is it.

01:49:45
<transcript>: Where is it? This number. I should have. I changed that. I did that on purpose. Because I'm dumb.

01:49:45
<transcript>: i

01:49:47
<transcript>: I should have never? Yeah.

01:49:53
<transcript>: What's going on? There we go.

01:49:53
<transcript>: log in

01:49:54
<transcript>: Log in succeeded.

01:49:54
<transcript>: now we're gonna

01:49:57
<transcript>: Now we're gonna do Docker, pull.

01:50:00
<transcript>: Oh.

01:50:05
<transcript>: We're pulling an image. We did it, everybody. Step one, complete.

01:50:07
pogjar: WOO

01:50:07
<transcript>: Thank you, dad.

01:50:07
shiftlessatol: it's okay, it's okay

01:50:08
andreccosta: easy

01:50:10
shiftlessatol: you're welcome!

01:50:13
<transcript>: Thank you. We did it. We did it so easy.

01:50:16
<transcript>: So easy, a caveman could do it.

01:50:18
<transcript>: Alright.

01:50:23
<transcript>: So now maybe we can actually do something.

01:50:27
<transcript>: Now that we've doneloaded the public image.

01:50:29
justincreateslive: so what exactly is this doing?

01:50:38
<transcript>: So the registry is public, but we still have to log into it so Docker knows how to see it. Otherwise, Docker's just looking at Docker hub. Right.

01:50:38
<transcript>: wow this is

01:50:41
<transcript>: Wow, this is gonna take a while. Apparently.

01:50:41
<transcript>: that fib

01:50:43
<transcript>: That fiber to my closet.

01:50:43
<transcript>: doesn't

01:50:47
<transcript>: Doesn't seem to be making this go any faster, does it.

01:50:50
<transcript>: Okay.

01:50:50
<transcript>: so

01:50:53
<transcript>: So, what exactly is this doing? Justin.

01:50:53
<transcript>: i'm glad you asked

01:50:58
<transcript>: I'm glad you asked. We're downloading this base image. This is an image.

01:50:58
<transcript>: while it's just

01:51:00
<transcript>: While it's just downloading I'm just gonna come over here.

01:51:00
<transcript>: so

01:51:03
<transcript>: So this is an image.

01:51:09
<transcript>: That is like preinstalled everything set up on this document.

01:51:16
<transcript>: To take advantage of Amazon EC two GPU hardware.

01:51:16
<transcript>: so

01:51:29
<transcript>: So EC Two it's like their virtual machine service. So if you just want to spin up a virtual machine on Amazon, you can go to the EC Two service. Choose an instance type. So what kind of a machine virtual machine do you want to run.

01:51:29
<transcript>: and

01:51:37
<transcript>: And you choose one that has a GPU. Now suddenly you have a GPU to deal with. You have to have the right coup drivers and all the right.

01:51:37
<transcript>: parameters

01:51:50
<transcript>: Parameters set up for taking advantage of that hardware, right? I want to I'm gonna build these models with GPUs on AWS. So these images are specifically tailored to working with all that Amazon hardware on EC two.

01:51:53
<transcript>: We're basically able to.

01:51:53
<transcript>: like

01:51:55
bheet: and you gotta trust them to not have bugs WutFace

01:51:59
<transcript>: Like already have PyTorch preconfigured to take advantage of the Kuda driver. All that stuff, right? All that stuff.

01:51:59
<transcript>: you got

01:52:05
<transcript>: You got trust them. Do not have bugs. Yeah, yeah, no, I think these are these base images are probably pretty solid.

01:52:05
<transcript>: amazon

01:52:25
<transcript>: Amazon's pretty good at this stuff. But basically we can take this base image now and we can start installing our stable diffusion stuff, our specific, like model stuff that we want to work with. And we know we already have the GPU configured and available to us through Kuda. And now like, PyTorch can just take advantage of it. We don't have to think about that part that makes sense.

01:52:29
justincreateslive: so the base image just has all the gpus set up

01:52:31
justincreateslive: yes

01:52:34
<transcript>: It's still downloading. That's why I'm still here talking to you all. I would be over there doing stuff, but it's downloading.

01:52:34
<transcript>: so the base

01:52:42
justincreateslive: i really like the filters on your cam thats soo cool

01:52:54
<transcript>: So the base image just has all the GPUs setup. Yeah, it's a software. It's an OS that's already installed and tuned to take advantage of Aws'gpu hardware, but it's specifically for pietorch. Like, you can get a TensorFlow base image. This is like specifically having Pi torch already set up to take advantage of GPUs.

01:52:54
<transcript>: on aw

01:53:03
justincreateslive: How many gpus are we talking?

01:53:05
<transcript>: On AWS. So hopefully this is the most efficient way we can build out this sort of like a laptop GPU farm on AWS with ECS. Ecs is Elastic Container service.

01:53:06
shiftlessatol: @JustinCreatesLive Adambucks on teh bottom of the chat and you can filter him too!

01:53:10
benanna19: Didn't know you had a stream til today! Been listening back through all the podcast episodes. Starting the AWS journey 🚗

01:53:23
<transcript>: That's how many GPUs are we talking? Well like depending on your instance type. So they have all kinds of different instances starting from like the G Three series. It's like cheapo and video cards up to like the P four or P five. Now before I think instance types that are like.

01:53:23
<transcript>: tesla

01:53:29
<transcript>: Tesla A 100s. These are Beefy GPUs. Like big, big ol, big ol guys.

01:53:41
<transcript>: Yeah. So depends on which one you choose, but the power of the GPU depends on the instance size and obviously cost more depending on the instance type.

01:53:45
<transcript>: And then that's for one VM or one container.

01:53:45
<transcript>: well now maybe

01:53:47
<transcript>: Well now maybe one VM.

01:53:47
<transcript>: so

01:53:53
bheet: Dojo cat

01:53:54
justincreateslive: So if you have multiple instances how will your distirbute the work load?

01:54:00
<transcript>: So that's the other thing ECS we have to choose. Do we want to use EC two instances for to back our ECS, our containers running an ECS, or do we need something like Fargate, which is on demand.

01:54:00
<transcript>: fargate allow

01:54:05
justincreateslive: or will you just need 1 instance?

01:54:07
<transcript>: Fargate allows you to not think about the types of instances, but the problem is you can't use GPUs in Fargate yet, but it's kind.

01:54:07
<transcript>: of

01:54:09
<transcript>: Of excited.

01:54:09
<transcript>: fargate is

01:54:18
<transcript>: Fargate is the like serverless offering. You can spin up containers OnDemand and scale down. You know you don't need them. That's more elastic than the EC two type.

01:54:18
<transcript>: but

01:54:29
<transcript>: But I think it reinvent. They're gonna announce the ability to use GPUs with Fargate. That's why I'm building this in the first place. I wouldn't be excited about it if it didn't have the Fargate stuff coming.

01:54:45
<transcript>: Okay, so how many instances you need depends on below. If you've got a thousand people trying to train new models on your thing on your API, then you scale out more and more of these instances that have their own Tesla 100 cards or whatever.

01:54:45
<transcript>: but upfront

01:54:48
<transcript>: But upfront. Yeah, just one. Is this we're just playing right now.

01:54:52
<transcript>: Let's see. Banana. Welcome to Chat. Banana.

01:55:01
<transcript>: Don't know or didn't know you had a stream till today. Been listening back through all podcast episodes, starting an AWS journey. Hey, that's so cool. Banana.

01:55:03
<transcript>: That's awesome.

01:55:03
<transcript>: i

01:55:03
ph208: From a high level how would an api to your service look like?

01:55:07
<transcript>: I yeah, I've got a bunch of the AWS FM stuff out there.

01:55:14
<transcript>: Here for some very smart people in the community on that podcast had a lot of really great people on the show.

01:55:22
<transcript>: Yeah. Adam Bucks on the bottom of the chat and you can filter him too.

01:55:24
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, Yeah.

01:55:26
<transcript>: You can add.

01:55:26
<transcript>: add filters

01:55:28
grasp5533: Is aws.fm over?

01:55:28
<transcript>: Add filters to my face.

01:55:37
<transcript>: So if you have multiple instances, how will you distribute the workload or you just need one is. Oh. So if you multiple instances.

01:55:37
<transcript>: you distribute

01:55:39
<transcript>: You distribute the workload through a load balancer.

01:55:39
<transcript>: so elastic

01:55:43
grasp5533: nvm lol

01:55:44
<transcript>: So elastic load balancer ELBs it's a service on AWS.

01:55:47
<transcript>: Yeah, we'll get there.

01:55:52
<transcript>: Hopefully we're doing as much of that in a managed way as possible where we're using higher level services.

01:55:52
<transcript>: gra

01:55:56
<transcript>: Graph is AWS FM over no.

01:56:08
neondactyl: My company is an azure shop

01:56:13
<transcript>: Not really. I'm just. I may be doing. We may have shifted into a data podcast. I started a new podcast with DAX called How About Tomorrow? And it's it's a little more broad. It's meant to be less pinned into just AWS stuff. We still talk about database all the time because we're really into it.

01:56:13
<transcript>: but

01:56:15
<transcript>: But.

01:56:15
<transcript>: that's where

01:56:27
<transcript>: That's where we're gonna be doing probably new episodes. I don't know that we'll never go back and create an AWS FM episode or I won't use that for something else and add more episodes to it. But the 33 or 34 that are there right now.

01:56:27
<transcript>: will probably be the only

01:56:33
<transcript>: Will probably be the only ones for a while, but check out the new podcast. How about tomorrow? Tomorrow? Fm.

01:56:43
<transcript>: We're still downloading. That's why I'm still over here talking to you all. I would be over there. We would be looking at my screen, but it's just downloading and that's that's really.

01:56:43
<transcript>: surprising

01:56:44
<transcript>: Surprising.

01:56:44
thdxr: good job marketing !

01:56:50
<transcript>: From a high level. How would an API to your service look like? Yeah. So PH the.

01:56:50
<transcript>: service was

01:56:53
<transcript>: Service was look like.

01:56:53
<transcript>: thanks

01:56:57
<transcript>: Thanks DAX marketing the podcast so the API would look like.

01:57:00
schrew: Adam what are we going to talk about when I get another 3300 adam bucks? Kappa

01:57:03
bheet: so you are saying we are a timepass

01:57:04
<transcript>: Create new subject like I want to create a new model with Dream booth.

01:57:08
<transcript>: And I'm gonna pass you like.

01:57:08
<transcript>: twenty

01:57:11
<transcript>: 20 ish images of this subject.

01:57:14
<transcript>: And maybe a name.

01:57:14
<transcript>: and

01:57:17
<transcript>: And then after 30 40 minutes.

01:57:27
<transcript>: And then the next thing you could do is maybe hit like a status on that so you could, like check the API, see what the status is of your new training subject.

01:57:27
<transcript>: and then

01:57:28
<transcript>: And then eventually.

01:57:44
<transcript>: You get a complete status and the model is ready and you can like you get a link to the checkpoint that you can download, and then you can use that checkpoint to do inferences. Or maybe the API. You have an agent route for inferences where they can say, use this model that I just trained. It's done.

01:57:44
<transcript>: use it and

01:57:47
<transcript>: Use it and give me an example.

01:57:47
<transcript>: of

01:57:49
<transcript>: Of that subject.

01:57:49
<transcript>: in using

01:57:52
<transcript>: In using this prompt so that subject.

01:57:52
<transcript>: on

01:57:56
<transcript>: On a mountaintop at night or whatever.

01:57:56
<transcript>: that's what

01:57:58
<transcript>: That's what the API would look like.

01:58:04
<transcript>: What are we going to talk about? When I get another 3300 atom Bucks? Uhoh.

01:58:04
<transcript>: uhohrew

01:58:10
<transcript>: Uhohrew, what is this? Oh, 3400. You're gonna have enough to get on a phone call with me. Yes.

01:58:10
<transcript>: i can

01:58:11
<transcript>: I can't wait.

01:58:15
<transcript>: Oneonone call, 500 Adam Bucks.

01:58:15
<transcript>: we're gonna talk

01:58:19
<transcript>: We're gonna talk about whatever you want to talk about? True whatever you want to talk about.

01:58:25
<transcript>: So I'm saying you're a time pass. I'm not saying your time pass, but if you want to if you want to infer.

01:58:25
<transcript>: that i'm saying that

01:58:36
<transcript>: That I'm saying that you wouldn't be entirely wrong. No, I'm just kidding. No. I mean, the whole point of me streaming is just to be with you all. So I just. I'm just explaining why we're not looking at my screen because.

01:58:36
<transcript>: it's still downloading

01:58:40
<transcript>: It's still downloading? How is it still there? I have fast internet.

01:58:52
<transcript>: I'm hoping it's going to be done soon. It seems to be like moving through some lists and we're way through that list, I guess.

01:58:54
<transcript>: Anybody know any good jokes.

01:58:59
<transcript>: Let's talk about YouTube. I started doing YouTube.

01:58:59
<transcript>: and

01:59:00
thdxr: OUT_OF_DISKSPACE_ERROR

01:59:00
<transcript>: And.

01:59:00
<transcript>: i gotta figure

02:00:51
<transcript>: we're still

02:00:55
<transcript>: We're still on. All we're trying to do is clone the repo.

02:01:00

<transcript>: Is there any official.

02:03:33
<transcript>: exit ryan

02:03:34
<transcript>: Exit. Ryan, say something.

02:03:39
<transcript>: I mean it sounds like it's official if it's on Shopify's website.

02:03:39
<transcript>: ryan

02:03:40
<transcript>: Ryan.

02:03:41
thdxr: Remix tweeted it

02:03:43
<transcript>: Ryan, that one.

02:03:44
xefiros: https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/1587090973594558464

02:03:44
thdxr: and they have a blog post

02:03:48
oetziofficial: maybe on their blog?

02:03:50
xefiros: yeah ryan tweeted

02:03:52
<transcript>: Remix is Here it is remix is joining Shopify.

02:03:56
thdxr: Remix is great for ecommerce so it makes sense but if they are giving up on RSCs that's kinda huge

02:03:57
<transcript>: Wow.

02:03:59
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

02:04:03
<transcript>: So this is interesting.

02:04:23
<transcript>: Okay. Now I just kind of want. Oh, it's still building. Okay. I'm coming back over here because it's building. Remix is great for ecommerce. So it makes sense. But if they're giving up on RCS, that's kind of huge. Yeah. Okay. So let's hop at this next, because we might need to just record a podcast.

02:04:30
hypermanu: green screeen?

02:04:34
<transcript>: My early thoughts on RSC's well, it's hard to have early thoughts on RSC's through the lens of next 13 cuz. I feel like Nick 13 is this big joke.

02:04:38
<transcript>: This joke where it's like next 13.

02:04:38
<transcript>: the

02:04:40
<transcript>: The new thing. Well, it's coming soon.

02:04:40
<transcript>: like they haven't

02:05:00
<transcript>: Like they haven't done the things that we all thought Next 13 would be right. Like, if you build just an app with just server components in Next 13, you get giant client bundles, just like you did before. There's no. And they said they're missing a key optimization. Yeah, they're missing the whole thing, right? Like, what am I missing here? Like.

02:05:00
<transcript>: if it's just

02:05:04
<transcript>: If it's just server components, we expect no JavaScript.

02:05:04
<transcript>: that's what i

02:05:12
<transcript>: That's what I expected, or at least very minimal, but it ships, the whole runtime, the whole thing. There seems to be no awareness that you're not using client components.

02:05:12
<transcript>: so

02:05:17
<transcript>: So like that's bad and for ecommerce.

02:05:30
<transcript>: I would think it's funny that like Versail, their big customer, like their big target is like Ecommerce where performance matters and we're shipping so much JavaScript in Next, and there doesn't seem to be a way to avoid it.

02:05:30
<transcript>: this

02:05:33
<transcript>: This is all very interesting. So the facts that.

02:05:33
<transcript>: a new remix

02:05:35
<transcript>: A new remix.

02:05:40
handlefa1: Oh, I punch my monitor a little bit and your glasses was disappeared

02:05:41
thdxr: quote from hydrogen roadmap:  While we’re excited for the future of RSC long term, as a critical dependency, it presented a number of challenges that became performance risks for our developers, and bottlenecks for our progress.

02:05:48
handlefa1: Nice timing

02:05:55
<transcript>: They had gone away from RSCs and didn't seem to be, well, I guess Ryan the other day tweeted that then ruled it out, but like, they seem to have gone with their own approach and not be like, oh, here we go. Put from Hydrogen Roadmap while we're excited for the future of RC, longterm as a critical dependency, it presented a number of challenges in performance risk for our developers, bottlenecks for our progress. Wow.

02:06:00
<transcript>: So give me some context. Here. Dax. I didn't realize.

02:06:03
<transcript>: Shopify was using.

02:06:07
<transcript>: Were they were they leaning into a next JS and server components.

02:06:14
<transcript>: Is that a thing.

02:06:16
thdxr: they were the only other RSC framework

02:06:19
<transcript>: Like I didn't know the story of hydrogen before this.

02:06:19
<transcript>: they

02:06:19
thdxr: hydrogen

02:06:23
<transcript>: They were the only other RSC framework. Oh, hydrogen, hydrogen.

02:06:30
<transcript>: Right? So Hydrogen was the only thing that had done anything with RCS before next 13.

02:06:30
<transcript>: and hydrogen

02:06:35
<transcript>: And hydrogen is moving away. So hydrogen is a Shopify thing. Oh, man, this is so good.

02:06:35
<transcript>: i love

02:06:36
thdxr: but now they're saying Hydrogen is going to be rewritten to be based on top of React Router data loading patterns

02:06:38
<transcript>: I love, I love the juiciness of the Web landscape.

02:06:54
thdxr: yeah I imagine so

02:06:56
<transcript>: Hydrogen was the only other do you think they were like burnt at all by the next GS, like Keynote and stuff where React and Next or versella are so like buddied up and hydrogen was like, Whatever. Forget this. I mean, they've been working on this deal for a while, I guess.

02:07:04
<transcript>: Hydrogen is going to be written to be based on top of react router data Loading patterns. Wow. This is so interesting.

02:07:10
<transcript>: So now the react team, all their hopes are on the next figuring out how to actually deliver.

02:07:10
<transcript>: on the

02:07:15
<transcript>: On the promises of RSCs. Do you get the sense acts that RSE.

02:07:20
<transcript>: Did not intend for the initial implementation.

02:07:20
<transcript>: to look like this

02:07:22
<transcript>: To look like this.

02:07:22
<transcript>: that

02:07:23
<transcript>: That it's a next problem.

02:07:23
<transcript>: that

02:07:32
<transcript>: That we're still getting all this giant JavaScript bundle. Is that like the React team didn't even expect that they had hope they'd be further along, maybe.

02:07:35
<transcript>: I don't know. This is all interesting.

02:07:40
thdxr: I have no clue

02:07:41
<transcript>: So.

02:07:41
<transcript>: i had also heard

02:07:44
thdxr: it's all surprising

02:07:45
<transcript>: I had also heard that that remakes was maybe getting acquired.

02:07:48
<transcript>: No Clue. Okay.

02:07:53
<transcript>: Yeah. Maybe we'll play with Next 13 on this stream. No, I don't have time.

02:08:03
<transcript>: I'm gonna like an hour. Let's get further on our stable diffusion stuff, but this is all very interesting. We need to record a podcast while all my thoughts are fresh.

02:08:05
<transcript>: I'll Ping you.

02:08:08
<transcript>: My thoughts aren't even like coherent but.

02:08:13
thdxr: kool

02:08:14
<transcript>: Oh, it's still building. Still building. I came over here for nothing.

02:08:17
<transcript>: So we're trying to build the conduit right now.

02:08:26
<transcript>: Why remix and Shopify.

02:08:34
<transcript>: So we have the remix guys been so salty on the internet if they've been working on getting acquired, like.

02:08:34
<transcript>: wow

02:08:40
xefiros: hi adam can share the docker file?

02:08:42
<transcript>: Wow, just hang back and chill and watch it all burn. Why have they been so like, in a bad mood? Am I the one thinks they've been in a bad mood.

02:08:46
<transcript>: Can I share the Docker file.

02:08:49
<transcript>: You mean this one.

02:08:49
<transcript>: it's like

02:08:50
<transcript>: It's like.

02:08:54
<transcript>: Not done anything with it yet.

02:08:55
xefiros: yeap

02:09:01
<transcript>: I don't think it would be helpful to you right now, but I'll share it's all gonna be open source when I'm done.

02:09:01
<transcript>: like when i

02:09:03
<transcript>: Like when I push it.

02:09:05
<transcript>: They like being in a bad mood.

02:09:07
xefiros: awesome

02:09:09
xefiros: thanks

02:09:19
<transcript>: Maybe that's it. Maybe some people just enjoy being in a bad mood. Okay, well, this thing's building this Conda environment, right? Yeah. Collecting package made today. While it's doing that, I'm gonna go pee because I got a pee. I'll bear back.

02:09:53
techxtalks: bad mood = higher code standards, just look at theo

02:14:50
neondactyl: This away scene looks lovely

02:15:10
neondactyl: @adamdotdev you can stay away, I'll chill watching this all day Kappa

02:15:48
<transcript>: Mood equals higher coding standards. Let's look at the O. That's a good one.

02:15:48
<transcript>: funny

02:15:49
<transcript>: Funny.

02:15:51
<transcript>: Okay.

02:15:56

02:16:07
ghostyx101: lol theo

02:16:07
<transcript>: Ah, Docker.

02:16:07
<transcript>: i know

02:16:12
<transcript>: I know it's not darker salt, but also kind of kind of is doctors. Well, maybe.

02:16:18
ghostyx101: gottas lot of flack talking bout paid boilerplate

02:16:20
<transcript>: 832 seconds, huh? We're just trying to create the conductor environment.

02:16:20
<transcript>: we're gonna find

02:16:24
<transcript>: We're gonna find out if we're missing some dependencies or anything in this image.

02:16:31
grasp5533: When are we getting lambdas with GPUs?

02:16:42
<transcript>: Lambda's with GPUs.

02:16:42
<transcript>: interesting

02:16:44
<transcript>: Interesting.

02:16:46
<transcript>: What's the use case? There graph.

02:16:53
<transcript>: I guess inference.

02:16:55
thdxr: more more: https://twitter.com/mjackson/status/1587083882741964800

02:17:01
<transcript>: More.

02:17:04
<transcript>: Give it to me, DAX. More.

02:17:07
thdxr: he subtweets vercel hard at the end

02:17:13
thdxr: For our partners, they know that Remix isn't a hosting company, so we aren't competing with them.  There is zero incentive for Remix to work better on some in-house hosting solution than AWS, Cloudflare, Fly, Deno Deploy, or dozens of others.  Remix runs EVERYWHERE 👌

02:17:17
<transcript>: I mean shopping. That's a big blow to for show, right.

02:17:30
thdxr: yeah Shopify def has way more weight than vercel

02:17:35
<transcript>: At the end. Oh, we're getting there.

02:17:35
<transcript>: i'm just

02:17:39
<transcript>: I'm just reading this. If you guys want me to read out loud, let me know.

02:17:50
thdxr: I wonder what % of vercel's revenue comes from shopify customers

02:17:54
<transcript>: Remix is now backed by a profitable business. A rare thing among JS frameworks.

02:17:59
<transcript>: That's a Jabbit for sale, right.

02:17:59
<transcript>: next yes

02:18:00
<transcript>: Next. Yes.

02:18:06
<transcript>: This is you Renovators project. Every open source project needs to solve this problem in order to scale.

02:18:12
<transcript>: For our partners. They know that Remix isn't a hosting company, so we aren't competing with them.

02:18:19
<transcript>: There is zero incentive for remix to work better on some inhouse hosting solution. Remix runs everywhere, yeah, Yeah.

02:18:21
<transcript>: This is so good.

02:18:24
<transcript>: Oh, man.

02:18:29
<transcript>: Owner of percentage of research sales revenue comes from shop by customers. That's a great question. Dax.

02:18:31
<transcript>: Yeah, the.

02:18:31
<transcript>: i feel

02:18:40
<transcript>: I feel like the salty level the like there might be level of concern level at Versel I gauge based on Gearmo tweets.

02:18:44
<transcript>: Feel like he's been coming at people on the tweets.

02:18:47
treflxyz: Adam send on chat this link with this TT thread

02:18:50
<transcript>: Think he's a little. There's a little bit of concern. This next Jess comp wasn't good. It wasn't good for Versaille.

02:18:58
<transcript>: I'm coming out and saying it. I know I just said a recap, and I was like, it was great, but like, I think this is not a good, not a good trend.

02:19:03
<transcript>: Adam sitting on chat this link with this true thread. Oh.

02:19:03
<transcript>: dax

02:19:05
adamdotdev: https://twitter.com/mjackson/status/1587083882741964800

02:19:07
<transcript>: Dax, just. Did I'll post it again. Here.

02:19:10
<transcript>: Yeah, this is a big deal.

02:19:16
<transcript>: There's a big deal because that it really is like.

02:19:16
<transcript>: next

02:19:21
<transcript>: Next JS and versell's Big market is ecommerce like.

02:19:21
<transcript>: that

02:19:23
<transcript>: That is their target.

02:19:25
<transcript>: Business.

02:19:30
<transcript>: And it has to be the types of sites that it supports, like.

02:19:41
<transcript>: They make a huge point of it like you look at the conference at the beginning. It's like look at all these ecommerce companies that use Verselle and next, JF.

02:19:46
<transcript>: And Shopify, there's no bigger in Ecommerce than Shopify, right.

02:19:49
<transcript>: So if the Shopify.

02:19:56
<transcript>: If Shopify starts pushing remix into all their tooling, and for all of their vendors.

02:20:03
<transcript>: It just has to be a huge, huge deal for Versail. This is not good news if you're guaranteed right now.

02:20:09
<transcript>: Owner Fees known that this was coming.

02:20:24
<transcript>: It's funny to hear that like Shopify is forward thinking.

02:20:35
<transcript>: And good at stuff. When I played with Shopify three or four years ago and tried to build like, a plugin for Shopify for a thing. I was making it's like a whole story.

02:20:37
<transcript>: I was not impressed.

02:20:37
<transcript>: with

02:20:38
<transcript>: With.

02:20:44
<transcript>: Like every Shopify store. They're all hot, garbage.

02:20:47
<transcript>: Just the amount of stuff.

02:20:47
<transcript>: all the play

02:20:50
<transcript>: All the play. I think it's it's probably the vendors fall.

02:20:50
<transcript>: they have

02:20:54
<transcript>: They have access to all these plugins. So they install all of them.

02:20:54
<transcript>: and like

02:21:02
<transcript>: And like, that's the state of the Web. Today you hit a page and it's like, hey, you want to sign up? Hey, don't leave. You want to here's an discount 10%.

02:21:12
<transcript>: And look at this thing. Look at that. It's just like Papa's testimonials. Like Ecommerce is kind of a disaster. It's probably the vendor's fault, though.

02:21:12
<transcript>: probably not

02:21:15
<transcript>: Probably not Shopify's fault.

02:21:26
<transcript>: But I also wasn't a big fan of, like, all the Liquid templates and stuff the way you build stuff on Shopify. So if they're moving toward, like, more modern stuff with Remix, that's pretty cool.

02:21:32
<transcript>: All right, check our quiet. What? Where did you guys go? We're, buddy. We all just reading Twitter.

02:21:39
shiftlessatol: I'm here

02:21:44
<transcript>: Dave? Still here.

02:21:44
<transcript>: i'm still

02:21:47
<transcript>: I'm still watching Docker, build.

02:21:50
<transcript>: This is a lot of stuff it's doing.

02:21:50
<transcript>: this condition

02:21:51
<transcript>: This condition.

02:21:51
<transcript>: create

02:21:52
<transcript>: Create.

02:21:57
<transcript>: And then we're gonna activate the LDM.

02:21:57
<transcript>: environment

02:21:58
<transcript>: Environment.

02:22:03
<transcript>: Then what are we gonna do? I guess I'll just go ahead and get ahead of the next steps.

02:22:06
shiftlessatol: I'm over-employed and under-paid... what is that called?

02:22:08
tayloreddev: also watching docker builds LUL

02:22:13
<transcript>: So there first set up the LDM environment. I think at this point we have it. You can also update an existing link and diffusion environment by running.

02:22:18
<transcript>: That so we shouldn't need to do we shouldn't need to install PyTorch.

02:22:27
<transcript>: We have to download the weights.

02:22:30
<transcript>: We have already downloaded them, but we have to.

02:22:34
<transcript>: Also watching Docker build.

02:22:38
<transcript>: Dave is overemployed underpaid.

02:22:38
<transcript>: what's that called

02:22:40
<transcript>: What's that called.

02:22:44
<transcript>: I think you nailed it with overemployed and underpayed.

02:22:44
<transcript>: think that's

02:22:47
<transcript>: Think that's the best explanation.

02:22:59
<transcript>: Reference sampling script. So I think once I have an LDL environment, I can start doing stuff with Dream boots.

02:23:02
<transcript>: I think.

02:23:04
ghostyx101: @shiftlessatol bad luck

02:23:07
<transcript>: Tayne, the pretrained stable diffusion models find their instructions.

02:23:07
<transcript>: weights can be down

02:23:10
<transcript>: Weights can be downloaded on Hugging face.

02:23:17
<transcript>: Also need to create a set of images for regularization.

02:23:34
<transcript>: More Images regularization. Please try 100 200 to better align with your original paper.

02:23:35
shiftlessatol: yep, just... yep

02:23:39
<transcript>: Okay. So this is how you train.

02:23:44
<transcript>: Okay.

02:23:47
<transcript>: Gpus zero.

02:24:00
<transcript>: Sks. Okay.

02:24:02
shiftlessatol: is anyone else's stream bitrate like 8kbps?

02:24:06
<transcript>: Let's Jumpin at me. Here.

02:24:12
<transcript>: Training will be run for 800 steps and two checkpoints will be saved.

02:24:12
<transcript>: one at five and a

02:24:17
<transcript>: One at five and a step to one at the final step. Typically, the one at five intercepts works well enough. I train the model to use.

02:24:17
<transcript>: two

02:24:18
<transcript>: Two.

02:24:18
<transcript>: a six

02:24:21
<transcript>: A 6000 GPUs. It takes 15 minutes.

02:24:27
<transcript>: So here's some qualitative results training.

02:24:27
shiftlessatol: seriously, it's like the resolution is designed for an apple watch

02:24:30
natedunn: !tabs

02:24:31
<transcript>: Issue and the Textual Inversion repository.

02:24:36
<transcript>: Okay.

02:24:36
<transcript>: folks

02:24:37
<transcript>: Folks.

02:24:37
<transcript>: container on the beach

02:24:39
<transcript>: Container on the Beach.

02:24:39
<transcript>: it works

02:24:40
shiftlessatol: oh, insta-fixed

02:24:40
<transcript>: It works.

02:24:45
<transcript>: Photo Escape Skin Around the Moon Also works.

02:24:55
<transcript>: A dog on top of an escape container. I love this stuff. This is so cool.

02:25:01
<transcript>: Is anyone else's stream.

02:25:04
<transcript>: Bitrate like.

02:25:04
<transcript>: eight

02:25:09
<transcript>: 8 kb/second. So usually it's like the resolution is designed for an Apple Watch. What.

02:25:14
thdxr: looks good to me

02:25:15
<transcript>: Oh, did you refresh? Maybe just refresh.

02:25:24
<transcript>: This is just doing stuff. So I just don't even want to, like, keep staring at it. Let's just come back over here.

02:25:24
<transcript>: oh

02:25:27
shiftlessatol: I didn't it just suddenly got better

02:25:32
<transcript>: Oh, let's talk about. I mean, you guys might have other stuff you're doing, but I'm gonna talk about it. You can listen or not. Thank you for the followup view. Gilmore. So.

02:25:37
<transcript>: I want to make like a weekly show.

02:25:39
<transcript>: I realized.

02:25:42
<transcript>: That Daily idea.

02:25:42
<transcript>: that's two

02:25:47
<transcript>: That's two that's too much can't do it daily. But I do want to make a weekly show.

02:25:56
<transcript>: They're just kind of recaps all the Dev drama. And like, this is a perfect example. So it's Today Monday, is it Monday.

02:25:57
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:25:57
<transcript>: it's monday

02:25:59
mr_yan19: ~2000Kbps for me

02:26:02
<transcript>: It's Monday, and we just got this bomb on Twitter.

02:26:04
thdxr: do you think we can hire Jon Stewart

02:26:06
<transcript>: Just dropped the remix acquired by Shopify.

02:26:06
<transcript>: all

02:26:14
<transcript>: All this implied there. Do you think you can hire John Stewart? You know, I should see what he's doing. He's probably pretty bored these days. Right.

02:26:20
<transcript>: No. So I want to do like I want to do, like, a real recap show every Friday.

02:26:20
<transcript>: that's like

02:26:22
<transcript>: That's like ten minutes.

02:26:22
<transcript>: fifteen minutes

02:26:33
<transcript>: 15 minutes, something like that. But it's written like one of the late shit or like a comedy show I think of last week Tonight, or yeah, The Daily Show, John Stewart, like these shows, where it's just like.

02:26:35
<transcript>: Pretty fast pace.

02:26:38
<transcript>: Funny, Jokes, images.

02:26:38
<transcript>: supplementing

02:26:41
<transcript>: Supplementing. So last week and tonight is like my favorite.

02:26:41
<transcript>: and he mostly

02:26:43
<transcript>: And he mostly dives into like single topics for each video.

02:26:43
<transcript>: this

02:26:54
<transcript>: This would be more like a news recap. It's almost like news anchor reading off, just like the bullet points from the week. Just imagine like a weekly hacker news. That.

02:26:55
<transcript>: The video.

02:26:55
<transcript>: and

02:26:59
<transcript>: And entertaining. I want to make it.

02:26:59
<transcript>: i want to make

02:27:09
<transcript>: I want to make this. I can't write it all. There's no way it'll be good. I could write some of it. Maybe and get lucky sometimes with some funny stuff. Maybe. I don't know. Probably not.

02:27:09
<transcript>: but

02:27:20
<transcript>: But I think of like how funny Twitch Chat is. And I think of how funny like Reddit is, and just the open source community. When you give, like a lot of people a microphone.

02:27:20
<transcript>: the funny

02:27:26
<transcript>: The funny stuff rises to the top. So is there a way to like, open source, write a show like this.

02:27:26
<transcript>: and

02:27:36
<transcript>: And then recorded every Friday, Live. What do you think? What is? What is everyone think? Is this possible? Or do I need to hire comedy writers? I'll do that if I have to.

02:27:46
thdxr: hire comedy writers and teach them about dev

02:27:50
<transcript>: Like, there's 1010 bullet points every week that matter, things that happen in the broader world of software development, web development, whatever.

02:27:53
thdxr: or teach devs to be funny...

02:28:01
<transcript>: Hire comedy writers and teach them about Dev. Yeah, that's the thing. Comedy writers would have to have the context or teach desk to be funny. I feel like there's funny Devs out there. If you could just get everybody.

02:28:01
<transcript>: that

02:28:04
<transcript>: That's funny and a developer.

02:28:09
<transcript>: To realize their vision. To realize.

02:28:09
<transcript>: they're

02:28:17
shiftlessatol: #unicornhunting

02:28:17
<transcript>: They're calling like this. Is it this is the place for you like I doesn't. This exists. Why is there not a funny like weekly.

02:28:17
<transcript>: dev

02:28:19
<transcript>: Dev News show.

02:28:19
<transcript>: mas

02:28:19
neondactyl: All of us devs are funny, that's why we're devs

02:28:22
<transcript>: Mask of Winners thank you for the follow.

02:28:26
<transcript>: All of us that's are funny. That's why we're dead. Exactly.

02:28:26
<transcript>: that's what i think

02:28:28
<transcript>: That's what I think.

02:28:30
cr4xr3v: ben awad but john oliver style?

02:28:31
<transcript>: These wouldn't be hard jokes to write. It's like.

02:28:40
<transcript>: Been allied, but John Oliver, stop John Oliver Style? Yeah, I don't know anything about Bin. I mean, I'm not watching even stuff. Really.

02:28:45
<transcript>: So I don't know. I don't people say he has dry sense of humor.

02:28:48
<transcript>: It could be dry. It doesn't have to be dry.

02:28:48
<transcript>: just like

02:28:49
<transcript>: Just like.

02:28:54
<transcript>: Fastpaced Live recording Graphic on the screen.

02:28:54
<transcript>: the graphic

02:28:56
<transcript>: The graphic.

02:28:56
<transcript>: is often with john all

02:29:06
<transcript>: Is often with John allver are the funny part along with the thing in the way he delivers it. Okay. So it's a lot of a lot of different things coming together. Maybe my vision of this being possible is like.

02:29:06
<transcript>: just

02:29:14
<transcript>: Just naive. Maybe this is not possible. And that's why it doesn't exist. I feel like I want to try. I want to try.

02:29:14
<transcript>: at least

02:29:15
<transcript>: At least.

02:29:20
blancriver: laugh tracks?

02:29:21
shiftlessatol: devs, dads, and duds

02:29:21
<transcript>: So that that's what I'm gonna do. I'll pull down the screen behind me.

02:29:21
<transcript>: and

02:29:25
<transcript>: And that way we can do cool graphics on the screen.

02:29:25
<transcript>: laugh track

02:29:28
<transcript>: Laugh track. Yes. Laughter.

02:29:33
<transcript>: Is this a title? A proposed title? Dave.

02:29:39
<transcript>: I own today Dev and weekly Dev. So it'd probably be weekly Dev.

02:29:43
<transcript>: Weakly, if you will.

02:30:03
<transcript>: I want to try. I don't know how I want to start. I need to write a little bit of stuff for, like, the CMS side of it, just like creating segments for the show and putting graphics in them. And I want it to all dispeed into my teleprompter and into my overlays that just shows up and I can just read the lines and it's popping up.

02:30:03
<transcript>: the graphics

02:30:12
<transcript>: The graphics at the right time. I just want to make it where, like, there's no postproduction whatsoever. Literally. I start streaming. The whole thing is just recorded live.

02:30:12
<transcript>: deliver

02:30:16
<transcript>: Deliver the thing and then it's up there on YouTube.

02:30:16
<transcript>: the vod or whatever

02:30:17
<transcript>: The VOD or whatever.

02:30:17
<transcript>: that way

02:30:25
<transcript>: That way I want to streamline it like that so that if I ever did, one of daily might be crazy, but go from weekly to daily. It's actually.

02:30:25
<transcript>: possible if

02:30:31
<transcript>: Possible if you could just write the stuff, if you could get enough of this stuff written. I think it's done, people. I think it's done.

02:30:34
<transcript>: Well, it failed anyway.

02:30:34
<transcript>: what

02:30:36
<transcript>: What did.

02:30:36
<transcript>: how did it

02:30:43
<transcript>: How did it fail? Your shell has not been properly configured to use conductivate. Well, that's you could have told me that. Like, I don't know.

02:30:43
<transcript>: sixteen hundred

02:30:45
<transcript>: 1600 seconds ago.

02:30:47
<transcript>: Geez.

02:30:51
shiftlessatol: right?!

02:30:53
<transcript>: To initialize your shell, run conduit. Initial.

02:30:57
<transcript>: Okay.

02:30:57
<transcript>: okay

02:30:59
<transcript>: Okay.

02:30:59
neondactyl: CONDA TWIN POWERS ACTIVATE

02:31:01
<transcript>: Well.

02:31:08
<transcript>: Condo in it. Bash, I guess. Is this bash? That it's, right. I don't know. What is a Docker file use.

02:31:11
<transcript>: Run, copy.

02:31:11
<transcript>: knit

02:31:12
<transcript>: Knit.

02:31:15
jamdotexe: Conda being conda I see

02:31:15
<transcript>: What do you think.

02:31:19
<transcript>: Probably bash.

02:31:19
<transcript>: i can't

02:31:24
<transcript>: I can't believe couldn't tell me that before it did whatever it just did for.

02:31:26
<transcript>: 15 minutes.

02:31:26
<transcript>: let's

02:31:28
<transcript>: Let's try it again.

02:31:32
<transcript>: Onto being Condi conduci.

02:31:32
<transcript>: yeah

02:31:38
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. We're doing this again. Do it again, people. I guess the init bash worked.

02:31:38
<transcript>: that's

02:31:40
<transcript>: That's cool.

02:31:47
<transcript>: Tree trend right kind of twin powers activate.

02:31:52
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow retest retest.

02:32:00
<transcript>: Here's an idea. Condo. Maybe don't take 20 minutes this time. Or maybe if there's a problem, just go ahead and let me know.

02:32:00
<transcript>: that'd be cool

02:32:01
<transcript>: That'd be cool.

02:32:07
<transcript>: This is why I hate Docker.

02:32:07
<transcript>: it's really

02:32:26
<transcript>: It's really not darker salt, probably, but it kind of is from an architectural standpoint. If I weren't having to build base images or build up these images to do my stuff in them, I wouldn't be waiting on Docker. So maybe it's on Docker's fault that this particular Docker file is doing all this hardware that takes a long time, but also, like, I don't know.

02:32:26
<transcript>: why

02:32:29
<transcript>: Why do we do this to ourselves? Why do we do containers.

02:32:29
<transcript>: they're so slow

02:32:33
neondactyl: `ps -p $$`

02:32:33
<transcript>: They're so slow. This Dev feedback loop is a nightmare.

02:32:37
<transcript>: Why though because.

02:32:37
<transcript>: i have to

02:32:39
<transcript>: I have to. I can't run.

02:32:41
ghostyx101: agreed

02:32:42
agemonkey: have you looked at podman

02:32:44
<transcript>: We can't create a custom Dream Booth model without.

02:32:44
<transcript>: container

02:32:46
ghostyx101: screw docker

02:32:47
<transcript>: Containerization. Unfortunately.

02:32:49
neondactyl: oh nvm that's a ps output formatting lol

02:32:55
<transcript>: Have you looked at Podman, Podman, you say no, but I got some time. So why not? Podman.

02:32:57
fredkisss: Wasm for the moon 🚀

02:33:01
<transcript>: Website for the Pod Manager Tool Podman. The site features.

02:33:07
thdxr: podman is good

02:33:10
<transcript>: A Dateless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI containers on your Linux system. Container's can either be around as root or in rootless mode.

02:33:10
<transcript>: oh android

02:33:14
<transcript>: Oh, Android, it's like a swap in for Docker.

02:33:19
<transcript>: I think my problem is not with Docker itself.

02:33:24
<transcript>: With the idea. Potman is good. That says Screw Docker.

02:33:30
haliphax: the "podman-compose" stuff isn't as good as docker-compose but it's getting there

02:33:33
cmjio: also checkout nix packs / nix-shell / nixos.  Ifound it through railway.app deployment process

02:33:33
<transcript>: That's a PS output formatting.

02:33:35
<transcript>: Wasum.

02:33:41
<transcript>: I'm gonna talk about WASM on a podcast. X. Can we do that.

02:33:57
thdxr: I need to google wasm first

02:33:57
haliphax: nix is pretty compelling

02:34:00
shiftlessatol: get ready for the bunny slope!

02:34:02
<transcript>: The pod made compose stuff isn't as good as dark compose that is getting there. Also, check out Nick packs. Nick Shell NixOS found it through railway app deployment process. Yeah. Calf a sus here a lot. He's a big Nick Sand. He'll tell you that sounds like I was talking about like the basketball team. The New York Nick Nicks is in NYX.

02:34:05
<transcript>: Get ready for the Bunny slope.

02:34:06
thdxr: I use nix

02:34:08
<transcript>: The Bunny slope.

02:34:12
<transcript>: Dax uses Nicks and also Arch Linux.

02:34:16
<transcript>: Are you Vegan DAX.

02:34:18
thdxr: there's nothing I love and hate more than nix

02:34:22
shiftlessatol: like a bunny trail - but a slope

02:34:23
<transcript>: Earlier, I had to mention it came up in context. Okay. I had to mention on plant based.

02:34:23
<transcript>: there's nothing

02:34:27
<transcript>: There's nothing you love and hate more than Nick's. That's funny.

02:34:31
thdxr: no I'm keto

02:34:33
neondactyl: I'm not allowed to be vegan.

02:34:36
<transcript>: Like a bunch trail, but a slope. There's a learning curve. I'm going down the band. This is gonna take forever, isn't it? This Conda in VI? I should get ready.

02:34:38
neondactyl: I love bacon too much.

02:34:42
thdxr: so opposite of vegan

02:34:43
<transcript>: Okay. Real quick. One SEC. Fuzzy. Did it work? Did I go fuzzy.

02:34:43
<transcript>: no

02:34:46
<transcript>: No. Why didn't it work.

02:34:46
<transcript>: fuzzy

02:34:47
<transcript>: Fuzzy.

02:34:49
<transcript>: Come on.

02:34:51
<transcript>: Fuzzy. Okay.

02:34:51
<transcript>: i just got to

02:34:53
<transcript>: I just got to check something real quick.

02:34:56
<transcript>: Over here.

02:35:00
<transcript>: Just me looking for.

02:35:02
<transcript>: Reinvent, leaks.

02:35:10
benanna19: I have all the questions about going plant based, but don't know that a stream is the place 😅

02:35:18
<transcript>: Roadmap.

02:35:25
<transcript>: My container nodes. Ooh. Okay, sorry, I don't mind me just trying to get answers to a question I had.

02:35:25
<transcript>: and

02:35:27
<transcript>: And now is the best time for me to do it.

02:35:31
<transcript>: Let's just say Oh.

02:35:34
<transcript>: Bummer. Okay.

02:35:40
<transcript>: Okay. Well.

02:35:43
<transcript>: It's coming.

02:35:43
<transcript>: just not soon

02:35:45
<transcript>: Just not soon enough.

02:35:52
<transcript>: Okay.

02:36:06
<transcript>: So your keto so opposite of Vegan OOH, let's do a podcast on eating.

02:36:08
<transcript>: That sounds fun.

02:36:26
<transcript>: I'm not allowed to be vegan. You love bacon too much. I have all the questions about going plant based, but don't know a stream, don't know that a stream is the place you had. No, I get it. That's probably not, but a podcast episode. Dax, let's talk diet, let's talk food, let's talk.

02:36:30
<transcript>: How long have you been? Keto.

02:36:33
thdxr: I'm so down

02:36:37
<transcript>: I hate Docker so much.

02:36:44
<transcript>: Who have more questions? Acts One. How long have you been keto.

02:36:46
thdxr: I do bursts of keto for 3 months when I get love handles

02:36:49
<transcript>: Did your wife make you become Keto? Was it your choice? Your wife's choice.

02:36:55
<transcript>: Do bursts of keto for three months when I get loving.

02:36:58
<transcript>: That's awesome.

02:37:01
<transcript>: So funny.

02:37:06
<transcript>: Oh, man.

02:37:06
<transcript>: how long

02:37:08
tayloreddev: I do keto, 50lb loss thus far

02:37:09
<transcript>: How long does Condo take.

02:37:09
<transcript>: oh yeah

02:37:13
thdxr: no it was me, my wife does not deal with keto well

02:37:19
benanna19: A good question for discussion, for those who work out, how do you get good levels of protein in a plant based diet.

02:37:20
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. I was gonna get ahead of the next steps. Let's look at the next steps. So we're gonna be training. I just want to get something trained locally. I don't actually think it'll work, though.

02:37:20
<transcript>: it's not gonna work

02:37:22
<transcript>: It's not gonna work because my GPU.

02:37:23
thdxr: she had to get her gallbladder removed so not the best diet for her

02:37:26
<transcript>: On this machine is not an Nvidia.

02:37:26
<transcript>: gpu

02:37:29
<transcript>: Gpu. But we do need to get.

02:37:29
<transcript>: the

02:37:33
<transcript>: The weights from hugging face.

02:37:35
<transcript>: So.

02:37:38
<transcript>: Their instructions. Let's see what this says.

02:37:41
thdxr: @benanna19 there was a whole documentary on plant based athletes I bet adam has seen it

02:37:43
<transcript>: The waits are available.

02:37:43
<transcript>: there

02:37:46
<transcript>: There. Yep, no limitations.

02:37:51
<transcript>: So I've downloaded. I've already downloaded it actually.

02:38:03
<transcript>: With them. Do I put them somewhere after obtaining the weights. Link them. Okay.

02:38:03
<transcript>: and

02:38:07
<transcript>: And sample with what.

02:38:10
<transcript>: Jeez.

02:38:12
<transcript>: I'm in over my head people.

02:38:20
<transcript>: I Do Keto £50 Lost thus far? Wow.

02:38:20
<transcript>: that's a lot of

02:38:22
benanna19: @benanna19 Oh nice, I need to check it out. We just had a baby and he has all the allergies haha

02:38:32
<transcript>: That's a lot of pounds. No, it was me. My wife does not deal with keto. Well, good question for discussion for those who work out, how do you get good levels of protein in a plantbased diet? Let me ask you this banana.

02:38:37
<transcript>: How's how does a gorilla get good levels of protein in its plantbased diet.

02:38:38
agemonkey: I do keto too

02:38:50
<transcript>: How do you think a gorilla gets its protein? This is the number one question I get. I've been Playt based for ten years. The number one question, where do you get your protein? I don't know. I'm not picking on you like you didn't ask it that way.

02:38:50
<transcript>: there's a legitimate

02:38:55
<transcript>: There's a legitimate question. A lot of people don't understand that plants have protein in them, and they have.

02:38:55
<transcript>: the right amount

02:38:59
<transcript>: The right amount of protein to sustain.

02:38:59
<transcript>: humans

02:39:00
<transcript>: Humans.

02:39:01
shiftlessatol: there's actually quite a bit in various plants

02:39:12
<transcript>: Most plants have ten to 15% protein makeup like the breakdown of their whatever their macro breakdown for the plant watermelons have a ton of protein.

02:39:12
<transcript>: surprisingly

02:39:13
<transcript>: Surprisingly.

02:39:20
thdxr: u calling me a gorilla?

02:39:23
<transcript>: She had to get her Glaw better removes. So not the best eye for her. That makes sense. There's a whole documentary on plantbased athletes. I bet Adam has seen it. I bet I have.

02:39:26
<transcript>: I've watched all the documents with my wife.

02:39:34
<transcript>: We just had a baby there's all the allergies, yeah, yeah, no, my littlest one has all the allergies for sure.

02:39:41
<transcript>: Age monkey. This keto two actually quite a bit in various plants. You call them your gorilla? No doubt. I'm saying.

02:39:41
<transcript>: go

02:39:43
bogeyy: or just eat beans

02:39:48
<transcript>: Gorillas only eat plants. Look how huge gorillas are. I think they're getting enough protein for those giant gorilla muscles.

02:39:51
<transcript>: So.

02:40:03
<transcript>: There is no lack of protein in a plantbased diet. Most of America thinks I'm just speaking to Americans. I don't know. There's a lot of people here. Probably not from America, but most of America thinks you need more protein than you actually do.

02:40:03
<transcript>: even

02:40:08
<transcript>: Even athletes don't need as much as they think they do. Probably.

02:40:08
benanna19: That makes sense. Just need to figure out a good grocery list. Trying to make it! I know i feel better when I eat more plant based food.

02:40:09
neondactyl: I act like a gorilla if I don't get enough sleep

02:40:15
<transcript>: Yeah. So that's my. Yeah. Beans. Tons of protein and beans. Exactly. Thank you. Bogey.

02:40:19
shiftlessatol: too much is too bad

02:40:27
<transcript>: Just need to figure out a good grocery list, trying to make it. I know I feel better when I eat more plantbased food. Yeah, it's a transition. So ten years ago, when we first started, I think we started by just.

02:40:27
<transcript>: what did we

02:40:29
<transcript>: What did we start? We started by cutting out.

02:40:39
shiftlessatol: salsa rice!!!

02:40:42
<transcript>: Well, first, before we decide we're gonna go plantbase, we started just cutting out high fructose corn syrup. Anything that had high fructose corn syrup was out. And that was like, we need to find a new grocery store, cause all they have is high fructose corn stress.

02:40:42
<transcript>: so we

02:40:46
thdxr: where are you on your seed oil journey

02:40:50
<transcript>: So we start shopping in different places and found foods that didn't have high friction corn syrup, but that cut out so much processed food, so many packaged foods.

02:40:50
<transcript>: and then after that

02:40:51
shiftlessatol: I miss those

02:40:51
<transcript>: And then after that.

02:40:51
<transcript>: we decided

02:41:04
<transcript>: We decided we cut out red meat. And then from there we decided we'd cut out whatever. And then we saw some horrible documentary about animal treatment at these facilities. And then we cut out all animal products.

02:41:10
<transcript>: The last thing we cut out was like, eggs and honey and things that are like.

02:41:10
<transcript>: byproduct

02:41:12
<transcript>: Byproduct.

02:41:16
shiftlessatol: "forks over knives"

02:41:17
proteinasek: NotLikeThis

02:41:19
<transcript>: Yeah. So I don't know. It was a big, long journey. It took, like, a year, but then eventually, we were fully planted.

02:41:19
<transcript>: and we haven't looked

02:41:21
<transcript>: And we haven't looked back.

02:41:32
shiftlessatol: " even our dog!

02:41:35
<transcript>: But it is a lot of, like, relearning everything you make it's like all of your habits very hard to change the way you eat because it's just so much of your, like everyday habits and things that you're used to making this thing with these ingredients.

02:41:35
<transcript>: when you have to

02:41:38
<transcript>: When you have to shake all that up, it's like living in a different country or something.

02:41:42
<transcript>: I act like you're grill if I don't get asleep.

02:41:48
<transcript>: Also welcome to Chat Bogey. Welcome.

02:41:53
<transcript>: Sulfur rice. That's right, Dave. Dave knows I eat a lot of rice.

02:41:53
<transcript>: where on

02:41:55
<transcript>: Where on your seed oil journey.

02:42:04
<transcript>: You know, seed oil. Where am I on my seed oil. So we try not to eat oil. That's another thing. That's harder than going plantbased, cutting out oils.

02:42:10
<transcript>: And these like different science backing all of my beliefs around food.

02:42:10
<transcript>: but

02:42:11
<transcript>: But.

02:42:21
<transcript>: Called me Lessels than former heart surgeon like does bypasses all day and looked into the science of why are all of my patients.

02:42:25
<transcript>: Dying of heart disease and.

02:42:25
<transcript>: a lot of it

02:42:34
<transcript>: A lot of it. I mean, I don't want to. I don't want to get too like controversial here, DAX, especially with the keto thing. Like lots of oils in a keto diet.

02:42:34
<transcript>: paul but

02:42:39
<transcript>: Paul, But Esselstyn would say, don't eat oils or any refined fats.

02:42:39
<transcript>: because

02:42:42
<transcript>: Because that's what.

02:42:42
<transcript>: does

02:42:53
watchbfl: Brooo I hate oily food

02:42:55
<transcript>: Does the artery thing so clogged the arteries or it causes the inflammation in the arteries, the endothelial cells. I know way too much about food and the body because my wife is really into it. She's like, really into it.

02:43:00
trout_soda: How do you get fats?

02:43:03
<transcript>: So, yeah, we try not to eat oils. We do eat tumorials, but, like, try to limit them.

02:43:07
watchbfl: I use way less oil than recipes ask for

02:43:10
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't call the Elsilon. He's like 90 something. He knows some stuff.

02:43:10
<transcript>: he knows

02:43:10
thdxr: you avoid all oils? where do you get fats from

02:43:12
<transcript>: He knows some things.

02:43:18
<transcript>: He calls heart disease a paper Tiger. Like it seems like this job.

02:43:24
<transcript>: In America, and it is. But like, we make it a problem, it doesn't have to be a problem.

02:43:24
<transcript>: there are whole pop

02:43:32
thdxr: it's not all oils though!

02:43:32
<transcript>: There are whole populations in the world that don't have heart disease because they don't eat what Americans eat. So we created this problem. It's really a toothless, paper, Tiger.

02:43:36
<transcript>: Where do you get your fat from.

02:43:36
<transcript>: avocados

02:43:39
<transcript>: Avocados nuts.

02:43:42
<transcript>: All the other planes that have fats in them.

02:43:49
<transcript>: Not all see? I no, no Ducks. I'm not trying to say, like, keto is all oils. And oh, you're saying not all oils are bad.

02:43:49
<transcript>: esselson

02:44:04
haliphax: "that good fat", to quote U-Turn from the HBO classic, Weeds

02:44:09
<transcript>: Esselson would say they are you say any refined fat? Like I mean, he would say eating too many of anything is bad. Like eating too many nuts. Like, think about how hard it is to crack a Walnut. Like if you're eating too many of a thing that really would have been hard to eat that much of and that's oils are just super refined, stripped down fats.

02:44:15
tayloreddev: coconut oil I use a lot in cooking with keto

02:44:16
<transcript>: That's good fat. To quote Uturn from the HBO classic weeds.

02:44:19
<transcript>: I don't know that reference.

02:44:22
<transcript>: Coconut oil Use a lot in cooking with keto.

02:44:28
<transcript>: Yeah, I will get into it next. I want to save some of this.

02:44:28
<transcript>: kaylee we're just talking

02:44:29
thdxr: ok we'll see who dies first

02:44:31
trout_soda: but those fats are just squeezed out to create their oils, like avocados and nut oils.

02:44:31
<transcript>: Kaylee, we're just talking about food right now. I see my wife to come in.

02:44:33
<transcript>: We'll see you diapers.

02:44:34
thdxr: hahah

02:44:36
<transcript>: I can't wait to do this podcast.

02:44:40
benanna19: I apologize

02:44:41
<transcript>: Why are we still waiting on Conda? Why I should be talking about.

02:44:43
haliphax: LUL

02:44:46
<transcript>: Stable diffusion and dream booth. What I'm talking about food, because.

02:44:48
<transcript>: Docker.

02:44:48
<transcript>: i blame

02:44:50
<transcript>: I blame Docker.

02:44:58
<transcript>: Those facts are just squeezed out to create their oils like avocados and nuts. Oils. Yeah, it's a problem with processing food is.

02:44:58
<transcript>: i think

02:45:03
<transcript>: I think I think personally, the ideal diet for human beings.

02:45:03
<transcript>: is

02:45:08
<transcript>: Is an abundance of whole plants, foods.

02:45:08
<transcript>: and

02:45:08
shiftlessatol: pytorch progress is stuck on 9

02:45:11
<transcript>: And it's the Symphony of them all working together.

02:45:11
<transcript>: that creates

02:45:17
<transcript>: That creates good health. That's what my stance on diet and eating.

02:45:17
<transcript>: is that

02:45:26
trout_soda: I can get behind that. good explanation

02:45:27
<transcript>: Is that. And when you refine a food, you take the food like, take a juice, like Orange juice. You take the Orange and you just extract all the juice.

02:45:27
<transcript>: and you leave

02:45:31
<transcript>: And you leave all the fiber and all of the pulp out.

02:45:31
<transcript>: i mean sometimes

02:45:42
<transcript>: I mean, sometimes I guess some people eat their pulp, whatever. But like the whole Orange was good as it was. You just took part of it out and you left the other part behind. And now you have issues like.

02:45:42
<transcript>: the fiber helps

02:45:42
thdxr: fiber counteracts the glucose spike!

02:45:46
thdxr: that's why orange juice is no good

02:45:50
<transcript>: The fiber helps regulate the release of the sugars in your body. I don't know. I'm not a scientist, but like I've heard this, this is what the scientists tell me.

02:45:50
<transcript>: okay

02:45:52
<transcript>: Okay. I'm gonna stop now.

02:45:52
<transcript>: exactly

02:46:01
<transcript>: Exactly. Jack gets it. It counteracts the glucose spike. That's why Orange juice is no good. Yeah. So you take a good food, like an Orange. You turn it into Orange juice.

02:46:06
<transcript>: You lost some of the goodness and even maybe created some badness.

02:46:13
<transcript>: I don't know. I need my wife to come in here and explain all this because she knows nutrition science really well. She reads all the papers. She knows the stuff.

02:46:13
<transcript>: i just

02:46:17
<transcript>: I just I get told all this stuff so I can.

02:46:17
<transcript>: regurgitate

02:46:19
<transcript>: Regurgitate some of it.

02:46:24
<transcript>: Pytorch Progress is stuck on nine? Uh Oh.

02:46:27
<transcript>: Is it stuck.

02:46:31
<transcript>: Did we run out of disk space in all series.

02:46:34
<transcript>: Did we run out.

02:46:36
<transcript>: We might have.

02:46:39
shiftlessatol: ##########9

02:46:42
<transcript>: Yeah. We need to talk about food decks. Because I'm surprised how little.

02:46:53
thdxr: agree very down

02:46:53
<transcript>: Food knowledge, knowledge there is in the United States, and probably the world. I don't know. I feel like the rest of the world might have it figured out. But America is so food dumb and.

02:46:53
<transcript>: so driven

02:46:55
<transcript>: So driven by.

02:46:55
<transcript>: marketing

02:46:59
<transcript>: Marketing and all the other problems with American.

02:47:01
<transcript>: Information.

02:47:04
trout_soda: okay but does chili have beans in it? the real Q

02:47:11
<transcript>: And distilling information and critical thinking and all of those things. They are exacerbated and like focused in on the food problem. Like they're amplified.

02:47:11
<transcript>: all the

02:47:16
<transcript>: All the worst parts of the way. Americans think we express them in the way we eat.

02:47:21
<transcript>: Okay. But does chili have beans in it? The real question.

02:47:21
<transcript>: our

02:47:25
<transcript>: Our eyebrows, facial, hair. There's a real question.

02:47:28
watchbfl: I think it’s convenience. Most ppl know the food they eat is bad imo

02:47:32
<transcript>: I can't believe I'm still waiting on Conda. Like, what is it doing right now? Like, what is all this stuff.

02:47:32
<transcript>: what is

02:47:34
<transcript>: What is? Why is pietorch? 1gb.

02:47:34
<transcript>: and

02:47:37
<transcript>: And what is going on? Is it stuck.

02:47:40
<transcript>: Are we actually downloading it.

02:47:40
<transcript>: is there

02:47:43
<transcript>: Is there someone in my office? Hang on.

02:47:48
<transcript>: He wants to come and see. I think.

02:47:54
<transcript>: Hang on one SEC.

02:48:00
thdxr: Adam's wife is correcting him on his food comments right now

<transcript>: Let's go ahead and bring them all on. Casey. Come on.

02:49:30
<transcript>: Is he dressing up? No. So for Halloween. So my wife and I actually have, like, a long history with Halloween. Even before, like before we work together.

02:49:30
<transcript>: we spent

02:49:33
<transcript>: We spent a couple of Halloweens like giving out candy together.

02:49:33
<transcript>: so

02:49:38
<transcript>: So it's kind of like our Christmas around here. Like it's the big one. Like we are very excited for Halloween.

02:49:41
<transcript>: We my seven year old.

02:49:41
<transcript>: is very excited

02:49:45
<transcript>: Is very excited to give out candy and to scare people that come to the door.

02:49:45
<transcript>: so that's what

02:49:46
<transcript>: So that's what we're gonna do.

02:49:46
<transcript>: he doesn't want to

02:49:56
<transcript>: He doesn't want to go trigger treating. He just wants to be here. He wants to plot out the scariest path to our front doors that he can plot out and give people their candy when they show up.

02:50:01
trout_soda: that's fun!

02:50:08
<transcript>: So we don't dress up. We dress up at the house. We're all skeletons. We all have skeletons. Outfits. We're gonna all be dressed up, giving out candy, trying to terrify some people. We scared some kids. Last year.

02:50:08
<transcript>: we scared

02:50:11
bheet: he must be a blue teamer

02:50:16
<transcript>: We scared some kids. I was hiding in a Bush. Or I would just be standing there really creepy. And they thought I was like a mannequin.

02:50:16
<transcript>: and then i like move

02:50:18
<transcript>: And then I like, Move. We had a good time.

02:50:22
<transcript>: Think they might be coming for another Lara Bar. Hang on.

<transcript>: Okay. You've met the whole family. Now, this has been fun.

02:50:40
<transcript>: And we're still waiting on oh, hey, it wasn't stuck. It's doing it's making it.

02:50:45
<transcript>: It must be a blue teamer? What's a blue Teamr.

02:50:51
<transcript>: So I just cracked you my comments.

02:51:09
bheet: defense in cybersec

02:51:11
thdxr: convenience exists in other countries and is still healthy

02:51:11
<transcript>: I think it's convenient. Most people know the food they eat is bad. No, I think that's true. I think that's the funny thing about being someone who has really, like, my wife has poured into it for years. But like having a general awareness of food and the American diet and all this stuff. The thing that's so surprising to me is like, I don't have to convince people.

02:51:24
thdxr: phenomena of people going to europe, indulging and not gaining weight

02:51:24
<transcript>: That what they eat is not a good idea because they know there's, like, we make jokes about it. Like I shouldn't eat this. Like we know it's bad. We know it's destroying our bodies, creating a healthcare crisis.

02:51:24
<transcript>: and yet we

02:51:27
<transcript>: And yet we do it every single day.

02:51:35

02:51:50
<transcript>: We had a good time.

02:51:58
watchbfl: I know for me it’s cause of not knowing how to cook very well. Working on that

02:52:02
<transcript>: Convenient exists in other countries and is still healthy phenomena of people going to Europe indulging and not gaining weight. Humans are weak. I grew with all these statements. All of them.

02:52:02
<transcript>: because

02:52:18
<transcript>: because of not knowing how to cook very well working on that yeah i get that i mean it is like i know when we've worked with families that really just wanted to like change the way they eat like they've come over and hung out and they're like hey i really enjoyed that meal and i would never guess it was whatever

02:52:18
<transcript>: when

02:52:25
<transcript>: When we've talked with families, there is like an initial curve where they want to go to the grocery store with them because it's like everything is new. You're starting over.

02:52:25
<transcript>: and that

02:52:30
<transcript>: And that is a lot. But I think it's worth just saying it's worth it.

02:52:30
<transcript>: all

02:52:32
<transcript>: All right.

02:52:46
<transcript>: You want to look at the screen with me again? I can't believe how much of this stream I've just been staring at Loading bars, waiting for stuff to happen. At least it's not stuck. It moved off of the thing it was doing. I don't remember what we said it was stuck on, but.

02:52:50
shiftlessatol: oh!

02:52:51
<transcript>: It's not doing that anymore. We're installing the Pip dependencies.

02:52:56

<transcript>: Nixafi cow faces back. Can you do a change, then fire the build off on a different terminal.

02:54:19
<transcript>: I don't know. Neon Deck, can you run Docker build twice in parallel on the same Docker file, I guess.

02:54:29
<transcript>: Anybody know the answer to that? What's your quick and easy, plant based meal that you end up making when there's nothing to eat? Okay, great question, Vincerf. For years, we ate.

02:54:29
<transcript>: var

02:54:32
<transcript>: Variations of basically the same meal.

02:54:37
<transcript>: Three, four times a week. Like all the time. Dave can tell you he was there.

shiftlessatol: I like that the console output is  "...working..." in exchange for it doing nothing

02:55:02
<transcript>: We do jalapenos. We do we make like a now we do much more sophisticated version. We're not just eating rice and beans anymore. We'll make like a it's a plantbased potatoes and carrots that makes this kind of cheddar cheese sauce, like a Nacho cheese sauce. So we'll make that so it's really good.

02:55:04
<transcript>: But like that.

02:55:04
<transcript>: kind of

<transcript>: Kind of.

02:55:06
<transcript>: basically

bheet: porridge

02:55:14
<transcript>: Basically Bryson beans with stuff on it. So like loaded rice and beans or in the if we get tired of rice, we'll do it with sweet potatoes. So last sweet potatoes.

02:55:20
<transcript>: But it's amazing how delicious. Amelia, you can make just taking a sweet potato and putting stuff on it.

02:55:21
watchbfl: Will you post some recipes ?

02:55:22
<transcript>: Quite good.

02:55:22

02:55:28
cowfacedude99: I don't think you can top off indians for vegetarian

02:55:30
<transcript>: i'm not smart

02:55:33
<transcript>: I'm not smart enough. I don't think.

02:55:33

vim_cerf: That does good.

02:55:44
im_noxz: mamba is conda in fast

02:55:44
<transcript>: Like the console output is working in exchange for it doing nothing. Yeah. At least it says it's working.

02:55:44
<transcript>: at least we

02:55:49
<transcript>: At least we know it's working 1400 seconds. How many minutes is that? We've been waiting.

02:55:52
<transcript>: 1400 divided by 60.

02:57:24
<transcript>: Do something somewhere in our always thought that much rice and beans wasn't that healthy? I love rice. Plus any veggies I fancy that day. Yeah. Same. I guess my wife does say the something about rice and arsenic levels. And some places in the world they're better than others. But if you eat rice heavily like a whole lot of rice all the time, you can actually get too much exposure to arsenic. Do this. Do the research.

02:57:24

<transcript>: 3 hours later what a giant wasted.

02:58:54
<transcript>: Can't you cash build some of this? Yeah, it's just this part. I mean, this is the thing we haven't completed yet, which is the condo run environment or conduct environment.

02:58:54
<transcript>: if we ever get

02:58:58
<transcript>: If we ever get to that point oh, it might be getting close. Look at this.

02:58:58
<transcript>: it's telling us how to

02:59:01
<transcript>: It's telling us how to activate it. I feel like it might be close.

02:59:03
shiftlessatol: aka "step 1"

02:59:07
<transcript>: How amazing would that be if it works? Oh, it did it, it did it.

02:59:09
<transcript>: Wait.

02:59:09
<transcript>: it didn't

02:59:12
<transcript>: It didn't activate, but it ran.

02:59:14
<transcript>: What'd it say.

02:59:14
<transcript>: no

02:59:16
<transcript>: No, no.

02:59:16
<transcript>: show has not been

02:59:20
<transcript>: Show has not been probably configured to use condactivate. No.

02:59:25
<transcript>: This is what happened last time we ran the whole step five.

02:59:25
<transcript>: again

02:59:26
<transcript>: Again.

02:59:28
andreccosta: looks frozen to us?!

02:59:32
<transcript>: But if failed on activate and it reran the step five. Why did you do that.

02:59:33
<transcript>: No.

02:59:36
<transcript>: Why.

02:59:36
<transcript>: to initialize

02:59:39
<transcript>: To initialize your shell run condo in it.

02:59:45
<transcript>: Your shell has not been properly configured.

03:00:01
<transcript>: Can you cash them? Hello, everyone. Wow. What happened to Morning Adam? Rugged Bear? Yeah. You know, I don't know. I've been streaming weird times. Just.

03:00:13
<transcript>: Weird times I don't know if I have a schedule anymore. Any advice for someone doing a career in serverless? I find I spend more time trying to convince people about serverless and actually getting to build.

03:00:13
<transcript>: ooh

03:00:19
<transcript>: Ooh. Didn't anyone respond to that? How am I with Spicy foods? I'm better than I used to be. I used to not be such a fan.

neondactyl: @BHEET KEKW

03:01:01
<transcript>: I believe your issue may be that you're sourcing your bash on a separate line.

03:01:06
<transcript>: Okay. This means that you're sourcing your.

03:01:08
<transcript>: What.

03:01:12
<transcript>: So do I need to do this. I need to chain them.

03:01:21
<transcript>: I need to like, do the init and then run create and then run activate all in one layer. Is that right.

03:01:23
<transcript>: I'm gonna have to read it a whole thing.

03:01:27
haliphax: frozen at 1194.8s looks like, yeah?

03:01:28
andreccosta: we're still watching docker build running step 5 :D

03:01:28
<transcript>: Is that right.

03:01:35
<transcript>: Activate and switch Anaconda environment in dark file but then do I have to also run all the training and stuff.

03:01:35
<transcript>: what

03:01:39
cowfacedude99: someone trigger rick roll

03:01:39
haliphax: counter isn't going up

03:01:42
benanna19: Gotta run. Thanks for having me!

03:01:47
<transcript>: What you've got way too many run commands. You're darkbows. Not just that each run creates a new layer in the image. It's also that each run command starts a new shell. Kind of activate applies only to the current shell. So this is why we have the problem.

03:01:50
<transcript>: So we have to do.

03:01:53
theruggedbear: your desktop screen is frozen

03:01:55
<transcript>: Knit. And then we have to do like.

03:01:55
<transcript>: and

03:01:58
<transcript>: And I just can't believe I'm gonna have to do all this again.

03:02:01
<transcript>: Can't believe it.

03:02:06
<transcript>: I should have just done it right here. Right.

03:02:10
<transcript>: I guess. Yeah. Like that.

03:02:10
<transcript>: okay

03:02:11
<transcript>: Okay.

03:02:11
haliphax: I tend to do a massive chained RUN command with bash -c LUL

03:02:13
theruggedbear: we are still on `Installing pip dependencies`

03:02:13
<transcript>: And then.

03:02:14
shiftlessatol: Adam, we can't see what you're doing in real-time anymore. we only see you in real-time and a screenshot of your shared screen

03:02:24
haliphax: yeah, desktop view is def frozen

03:02:27
<transcript>: Believe it. I can't believe it. People.

03:02:31
<transcript>: You guys let me do that. Just kidding.

03:02:34
<transcript>: Wow, how did you.

03:02:35
<transcript>: Condom.

03:02:42
<transcript>: Create and conductivate and why why does it take so long.

03:02:52
<transcript>: The show will be gone. So if you want to do something else to that kind of remember at first you gotta kind of activate again or else use.

03:02:52
<transcript>: in

03:02:52
cowfacedude99: we can't see. so we can't do anything LUL

03:02:53
<transcript>: In.

03:02:53
<transcript>: something

03:02:59
<transcript>: Something inside of our activate first when you start a container from the image, you also have to call content. Activate inside a container.

03:03:02
<transcript>: What's the best way to do this.

03:03:08
<transcript>: Oh wait, you really you guys really can't see anything anymore.

03:03:11

03:04:47
<transcript>: And I don't why I could try.

03:04:49
shiftlessatol: screenshot!

03:04:51
<transcript>: I could try switching mothers.

03:04:52
neondactyl: weird, that particular capture just died

03:04:54
<transcript>: They're.

03:04:54
<transcript>: this one

03:04:56
<transcript>: This one see that.

03:04:59
<transcript>: You'll see that? Yeah, you do.

03:04:59
<transcript>: let's try

03:05:01
shiftlessatol: twitch is trolling you

03:05:02
neondactyl: Yes

03:05:03
<transcript>: Let's try changing it, though. It's writing this Pro display.

03:05:05
cowfacedude99: we can see the chat

03:05:09
<transcript>: Said to shake it up a little bit sometimes you just gotta turn it off. Turn it back on. How about that.

03:05:15
theruggedbear: lets goo

03:05:17
<transcript>: Okay weird. That particular capture just died. Yeah, just died. I don't know. I'll try updating OBS later.

03:05:18
neondactyl: Congrats, tech pro in action

03:05:19
shiftlessatol: yayz

03:05:20
<transcript>: So what's the deal here.

03:05:20
cowfacedude99: niceee

03:05:27
kodder: !theme

03:05:27
fossabot: Adam uses the Dracula theme and the Operator Mono font in VSCode.

03:05:29
<transcript>: What's the deal? I don't know if I should do this because then when I need to use the environment, like when I start training.

03:05:34
<transcript>: I'm also gonna need to specify the environment, right. So maybe I should just.

03:05:39
<transcript>: See where are the.

03:05:51
<transcript>: This one preparation. So set up the LDM environment following the instruction for technical version so it's created in this image it's just not activated to fine tune a stable diffusion model. So Here's.

03:05:51
<transcript>: let's do this

03:05:52
<transcript>: Let's do this.

03:06:00
<transcript>: Maybe I can still preserve the cache. That would be fantastic. I'm not gonna be able to am I probably not.

03:06:02
<transcript>: So here.

03:06:02
<transcript>: we're

03:06:09
<transcript>: We're gonna do Conda init bash and Conda activate LDM.

03:06:09
<transcript>: please save

03:06:13
<transcript>: Please save the cash. Please don't rerun this command. Please.

03:06:13
<transcript>: please

03:06:14
<transcript>: Please.

03:06:18
<transcript>: Say well.

03:06:18
<transcript>: i think it's

03:06:21
<transcript>: I think it's gonna redo the whole thing.

03:06:26
<transcript>: Did it cash any of the steps earlier.

03:06:40
<transcript>: Yeah. Cash, work, dirt. See, those were cash. So why? Oh, cuz. I added a command. So I think it actually will. I think it'll actually cash them. Watch. Just watch.

03:06:46
<transcript>: Come on. No. Amy, no Amy, no Emmy. Cashed.

03:06:49
<transcript>: We did it.

03:06:49
<transcript>: still didn't

03:06:52
<transcript>: Still didn't work, but it didn't rerun.

03:06:54
shiftlessatol: use this command --spend-adam-bucks true

03:06:57
<transcript>: The create thing Shell's not been properly configured to use Khan activate.

03:06:57
<transcript>: but

03:07:03
<transcript>: But I just said Conda, and it bash and condactivate. Ldm. So what's the problem.

03:07:06
<transcript>: What's the problem.

03:07:16
<transcript>: Use the command Spin Atom Bucks true.

03:07:18
haliphax: you can cache the pip dir between builds/steps too if that helps

03:07:19
<transcript>: I don't think that'll work.

03:07:19
<transcript>: i don't think

03:07:19
shiftlessatol: for better cash

03:07:21
<transcript>: I don't think that'll do it, Dave.

03:07:29
<transcript>: You may need to close and restart your shell after running Condo Knit. Well, that doesn't. That's not happening.

03:07:31
<transcript>: Conda in it back.

03:07:31
<transcript>: and cond

03:07:33
<transcript>: And conductivate LDM.

03:07:48
<transcript>: Assuming you want to install the common environment and run something in it. This approach uses INF Path to launch Python indirectly in that kind environment. Once one can be left wondering if this approach really activates the right so long as the subsequent commands work, it may not matter.

03:07:48
<transcript>: okay

03:07:49
<transcript>: Okay.

03:07:49
<transcript>: so

03:07:51
<transcript>: So they're doing.

03:07:51
<transcript>: this

03:07:55
<transcript>: This set. X and Con. Install.

03:07:55
<transcript>: kind of

03:07:58
<transcript>: Kind of create kind of clean copy.

03:08:01
<transcript>: In path.

03:08:16
<transcript>: Why are not listen to music people? Why.

03:08:22
<transcript>: You can cash the Piper between build steps two, if that helps.

03:08:28
<transcript>: What I want to do is how can I use how can I activate this environment.

03:08:37
<transcript>: I want to activate it, and then I want to.

03:08:44
<transcript>: Do the next steps. What are the next step? Let's just move on. So next steps, we're gonna take the hugging, face weights.

03:08:44
<transcript>: so let's

03:08:47
<transcript>: So let's see. Downloads.

03:08:51
<transcript>: Where are the hugging face weights.

03:08:58
<transcript>: Here we go. Nope.

03:08:58
<transcript>: nope

03:09:00
<transcript>: Nope.

03:09:03
<transcript>: Where are they.

03:09:03
<transcript>: i think i

03:09:05
<transcript>: I think I moved them into.

03:09:07
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:09:07
<transcript>: i'm

03:09:12
<transcript>: I'm so unorganized. I just need somebody to organize everything for me.

03:09:12
<transcript>: and tell me where

03:09:14
<transcript>: And tell me where stuff is.

03:09:14
<transcript>: dream

03:09:15
<transcript>: Dream booth.

03:09:30
<transcript>: There they are. Those are the weights. Seven, seven. Gigs.

03:09:30
<transcript>: so

03:09:34
<transcript>: So where do I want those? I want to copy them.

03:09:48
<transcript>: And then I want to paste them. Where.

03:09:48
<transcript>: so

03:09:53
<transcript>: So our Docker files just right there. So I'm gonna put them right there. Model checkpoint.

03:09:55
<transcript>: Okay.

03:09:59
<transcript>: Getting a lot of, like chatter, a lot of messages and my instant messaging.

03:09:59
<transcript>: ding

03:10:01
<transcript>: Ding and me.

03:10:04
<transcript>: Think for the follow Hypertext.

03:10:13
<transcript>: Oh, okay. So I put the model, the weights right there. Then what can we just start running a command? Let's just try.

03:10:16
<transcript>: Let's just try running one of the commands which.

03:10:21
<transcript>: Need to create a set of images. I've already done that.

03:10:26
<transcript>: Stable text to image PY.

03:10:30
<transcript>: Wait. What does this do.

03:10:30
<transcript>: generate

03:10:35
<transcript>: Generate that's generating regularization images. We don't need to do that. We are 200.

03:10:37
<transcript>: Generate eight images.

03:10:43
<transcript>: Okay. Training. Here we go. This is the thing we need to run people.

03:10:47

03:10:48
<transcript>: This is the thing I need to run. So how am I going to do that.

03:10:51
uberrick: Hey Adam, how are you?

03:10:54
shiftlessatol: then use the bookmark

03:10:55
<transcript>: Well we're gonna do run Python main.

03:11:02
<transcript>: Oh, I got actually like.

03:11:05
uberrick: Twitch chat has been messing up today so I was just a lurking earlier haha

03:11:11
<transcript>: I gotta do that when I'm gonna activate LDM we're just going to.

03:11:11
<transcript>: run this and

03:11:14
<transcript>: Run this and hopefully tell it to you.

03:11:16
uberrick: lurker*

03:11:19
<transcript>: The Khana environment. Somehow I don't know how we're gonna see.

03:11:25
<transcript>: We need to get cloned something.

03:11:31
<transcript>: That run, get clone. And it's this one.

03:11:39
<transcript>: I guess I need to do.

03:11:43
shiftlessatol: # Deep Learning Containser Resource

03:11:54
shiftlessatol: Container*

03:11:57
<transcript>: And get clone so we're backing up to the up above stable diffusion directory.

03:11:58
<transcript>: I think.

03:12:04
<transcript>: And well, does this one actually have its own environment? That it does what.

03:12:06
<transcript>: Okay.

03:12:06
<transcript>: well

03:12:10
<transcript>: Well, I don't know if I needed to do that in the first place.

03:12:15
<transcript>: Detox variation. So I should have just been cloning this repo.

03:12:15
<transcript>: this dream

03:12:17
<transcript>: This dream disabled fusion.

03:12:22
<transcript>: Right.

03:12:39
<transcript>: Okay. And then this is our worker.

03:12:42
<transcript>: Dream booth.

03:12:46
<transcript>: I'm not capitalization matters.

03:12:46
<transcript>: but

03:12:48
<transcript>: But oh, Geez.

03:12:57
<transcript>: Nope.

03:13:04
<transcript>: Okay. So that's gonna use that environment. Yaml.

03:13:04
<transcript>: we're not gonna

03:13:11
<transcript>: We're not gonna activate it, and then we're going to run Python main Pi base, configs.

03:13:11
<transcript>: that's a directory

03:13:14
<transcript>: That's a directory here? Yep. Civil Fusion version one.

03:13:14
<transcript>: version

03:13:18
<transcript>: Version one finetune unfrozen YAML.

03:13:20
<transcript>: What is that.

03:13:30
<transcript>: So it's just a file in here. Does it point to anything on the system I need to have.

03:13:34
<transcript>: Rick is here.

03:13:44
<transcript>: I'm good. Rick, how are you? Use the bookmark? Twitch Chat has been messing up today, so I was just alerting earlier. No worries.

03:13:49
<transcript>: Good to have you here, Rick. I'm not gonna be on much longer. Oh, Geez, I'm gonna be on for three more minutes.

03:13:49
<transcript>: probably

03:13:56
<transcript>: Probably last. I should probably just say bye, but I want to get this building. I'm not gonna get a building, am I? I mean, it takes 20 minutes.

03:13:56
<transcript>: to run

03:13:58
<transcript>: To run the container or whatever.

03:14:00
<transcript>: Okay.

03:14:11
<transcript>: This thing is a little loosey goosey on the details. I feel like the.

03:14:11
<transcript>: readme

03:14:12
<transcript>: Readme is leaving.

03:14:12
<transcript>: what did i do

03:14:13
shiftlessatol: https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/x7h5l5/dreambooth_implementation_on_stable_diffusion/

03:14:13
<transcript>: What did I do.

03:14:21
<transcript>: It's leaving a little bit to the imagination. So preparation set up an LDL LDM environment.

03:14:26
<transcript>: Yeah, but don't use their environment. Use this environment. Yaml right. I'm guessing.

03:14:29
<transcript>: And then.

03:14:36
<transcript>: Need to obtain the pretrained weights. Yeah. And then what do you do with them.

03:14:36
<transcript>: like they don't

03:14:42
<transcript>: Like they don't say what to do with the weights. Am I supposed to put them somewhere specific? Probably. But where.

03:14:45
<transcript>: Are all the details.

03:15:04
<transcript>: Some cases it's a generated regularization images are highly unrealistic. You can find a diverse set of images. Yeah. I've got those training.

03:15:10
<transcript>: Detailed configuration we found in that I looked at it, in particular, the default learning rate. That's fine.

03:15:10
<transcript>: placeholder word

03:15:13
<transcript>: Placeholder word Yep.

03:15:13
<transcript>: okay

03:15:16
<transcript>: Okay. So my question is.

03:15:16
<transcript>: where are

03:15:18
<transcript>: Where are where do the way to go.

03:15:18
<transcript>: where do the

03:15:20
<transcript>: Where do the weights go.

03:15:30
<transcript>: Well.

03:15:36
<transcript>: Where did we get today.

03:15:37
<transcript>: Somewhere.

03:15:37
<transcript>: kind of

03:15:40
<transcript>: Kind of not very far.

03:15:50
<transcript>: I wonder if I would have been in a faster offstream. I wonder if I would have gotten any further today if I weren't streaming.

03:15:54
sockthedev: More emphasis should be put on teaching developers about the importance / effectiveness of solid docs.

03:15:58
<transcript>: Logically. I would think yes, but my gut says no. I just think this stuff sucks.

03:15:58
<transcript>: more emphasis

03:16:03
andreccosta: blaming chat? D:

03:16:03
<transcript>: More emphasis should be put on teaching developers about the important effectiveness of Solid Dock. Exactly. Socks.

03:16:03
<transcript>: exactly

03:16:09
<transcript>: Exactly. These docs. Right. Blaming Chat. No, I'm not Blooming. I'm saying I wouldn't have gotten any further.

03:16:09
<transcript>: saying if i

03:16:13
<transcript>: Saying if I didn't stream today, I don't think I would have gotten any further because.

03:16:13
<transcript>: i think

03:16:16
<transcript>: I think this stuff just is terrible. Docker.

03:16:16
<transcript>: base

03:16:18
<transcript>: Base images.

03:16:18
<transcript>: all this non

03:16:28
<transcript>: All this nonsense, but it's been fun. I had a good time hanging out with you guys. At least I got to have a good time hanging out with you all. If I didn't have that, this would have been very depressing.

03:16:30
<transcript>: This would have been my day. I would have just like.

03:16:30
<transcript>: actually

03:16:33
shiftlessatol: https://github.com/JoePenna/Dreambooth-Stable-Diffusion

03:16:35
<transcript>: Actually, I'm gonna be back. I'm gonna be doing some more stuff. I just have to go up and help my wife with something.

03:16:41
<transcript>: But yeah, I've seen the Joe Pentagon one, Dave. Is it better.

03:16:41
<transcript>: i don't know

03:16:43
<transcript>: I don't know if it's better maybe it's better.

03:16:43
<transcript>: i'll take a look

03:16:50
<transcript>: I'll take a look when I get back. I don't know if I'll stream when I get back but I will be streaming tomorrow morning. I can't wait. Maybe we could do it against sometime.

03:16:50
shiftlessatol: he says it is

16:32:55
<transcript>: Hey, sugar.

16:32:59
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm coming.

16:33:28
<transcript>: Oh, that won't turn off. No.

16:33:31
<transcript>: I did.

16:33:35
<transcript>: Not.

16:34:00
<transcript>: Like.

16:34:03
<transcript>: Velko that.

16:34:03
<transcript>: could just

16:34:05
<transcript>: Could just put the light.

16:34:05
<transcript>: on the back

16:34:07
<transcript>: On the back.

16:34:13
<transcript>: It's just Velcro, and there's a little switch on it.

16:34:25
<transcript>: All right.
