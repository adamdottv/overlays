thdxr: lit like web components?

00:22:39
<transcript>: Having a nice studio sets. A good vibe. It does. I love walking into my office every morning for what it's worth. So I don't know. Do I need a studio to have a nice office? No.

00:22:47
<transcript>: What's the difference in analysis in the studio? I guess I would ask if you have a camera in your office. Is it a meeting studio? Thank you for that. Follow.

00:22:47
<transcript>: nicholas

00:22:48
aj_stuyvenberg: lmao no context quote: "I laughed at something I saw on twitter yesterday"

00:22:49
<transcript>: Nicholas von Bach.

00:22:51
salkinvonbach: I dislike web devs but you seem chill

00:23:03
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't know. Why do I have a studio? Great question. I guess I decided. Oh, actually, I bought the cameras. Originally. Could make a course. Like a course on programming.

00:23:03
<transcript>: and

00:23:06
<transcript>: And then I started streaming, and I never made the course.

00:23:06
<transcript>: then i started

00:23:11
<transcript>: Then I started playing in YouTube, so I have reasons to have a studio kind of.

00:23:15
<transcript>: Cosi is here. I mean, Adam is from ozark. Why can't you have a studio.

00:23:15
<transcript>: why can't

00:23:20
<transcript>: Why can't I have a studio? It's one studio. Myh. What does it cost? Like ten dollars.

00:23:20
<transcript>: it's

00:23:22
<transcript>: It's like web components.

00:23:22
<transcript>: lit

00:23:30
sj_se: @SalkinvonBach pretty harsh stance. what kind of dev are you?

00:23:34
<transcript>: Lit. A lit like Web components. I understand that reference. Now someone told me what lit is. It has to do with Web components. Low level learning. Thanks so much for the follow. Hey, it was fun playing.

00:23:34
<transcript>: playing among us with you

00:23:35

<transcript>: Welcome, welcome.

00:23:55
kociqq: @KociQQ Lmao

00:23:56
joshuajebaraj: Your camera is dope , I could able to see even smaller details

00:23:58
<transcript>: It was so good. I've never played among us. Yeah, I was so bad. But it was so fun. It's like just an hour of getting to lie to your friends. How fun is that.

00:23:58
<transcript>: can't

00:24:00
stroopwafel26: Some things never change, like @adamdotdev trying to understand gen z things

00:24:01
<transcript>: Can't think of anything more fun.

00:24:01
<transcript>: let's see

00:24:07
kociqq: "The Webdev Casino"

00:24:08
<transcript>: Let's see I missed something pretty harsh stance. What kind of deborah? You dislike webdes, but you seem to.

00:24:08
<transcript>: i didn't

00:24:08
salkinvonbach: We have a virtual production studio, a photography studio and a way way too much money invested in audio production so I don't think this counts

00:24:14
thdxr: Adam finally memorized my username

00:24:16
<transcript>: I didn't see that. It's funny. No context. Foot. I laugh at something I saw on Twitter yesterday. Oh, I totally forgot to finish that sentence. Thank you. Aj.

00:24:16
<transcript>: i saw something

00:24:25
<transcript>: I saw something on Twitter that was like it was this morning. Actually, it was just the most cheesy. I hope it wasn't you. Aj. It was just a really like cheesy meme.

00:24:30
aj_stuyvenberg: HAHA I hope it was me

00:24:39
aj_stuyvenberg: thedaxr

00:24:39
<transcript>: Photo with caption. It was like, such a dad joke. And it made me chuckle. And I realized, like, yeah, that's me. I'm a millennial, millennial, middleaged dad. And I think those kind of jokes are funny.

00:24:39
<transcript>: can't do anything about it

00:24:40
<transcript>: Can't do anything about it.

00:24:45
jammontoast: Haters gonna hate

00:24:53
<transcript>: Could have a casino. Is that Daniel? Is that a reference to the TV show ozark? I'm really not that up to speed on TV shows. Or does he have a casino.

00:24:56
<transcript>: Or is that a.

00:24:56
<transcript>: arrested development

00:24:58
<transcript>: Arrested Development Reference that I forget.

00:25:01
danielgerep: Yes, a reference to that show :D

00:25:02
<transcript>: Okay. So we're gonna do the.

00:25:08
<transcript>: Something. Let me try and understand gyms. These things we're gonna do the office tour.

00:25:08
<transcript>: could someone

00:25:13
<transcript>: Could someone just tell me if I'm saying to or right, Ali, could you see me a video, please.

00:25:13
<transcript>: of how to pronounce

00:25:22
ryankhawkins: @KociQQ poker table off to the side... Kappa

00:25:23
nexxeln: its whatever

00:25:24
<transcript>: Of how to pronounce tour? Is it tour? Like more like tor or Tours. I feel like when I say it with two syllables, that's wrong. It should be a one syllable word, right? Tour.

00:25:25
salkinvonbach: I used to be a hardware and firmware dev but like custom silicon - got axxed in pandemic though

00:25:26
<transcript>: Tour.

00:25:27
o_fruit_o: two-rrrrr

00:25:29
<transcript>: Okay.

00:25:33
parkour_peter: T√ºr

00:25:38
<transcript>: I finally memorized your username. Yeah, dax. So many times I've said PH. Xdr. Now I can type it first. Try. Every time.

00:25:38
kociqq: @KociQQ Casino layout made in flexbox Kappa

00:25:43
<transcript>: Tour see it would help if I knew the the dots over the U.

00:25:43
<transcript>: two

00:25:45
<transcript>: Two.

00:25:46
o_fruit_o: Or just "crib"

00:25:52
stroopwafel26: I pronounce it like tour but tour is fine as well

00:25:57
parkour_peter: U umlaut

00:26:02
ryankhawkins: @stroopwafel26 same

00:26:03
<transcript>: R two R says oh, Frudo used to be a hardware and firmware dev, but like Custom Silicon got axed in Pandemic, though. I'm so sorry about that, Nicholas. I think I'm actually gonna remember your name already. We've chatted like three times, and I think I've already got that. Falcon is Nicklas.

00:26:03
<transcript>: my brain

00:26:07
<transcript>: My brain is doing that reverse real fast.

00:26:12
salkinvonbach: Thanks

00:26:17
<transcript>: A hardware and firmware dev. That sounds intense. That sounds really hard, actually. Like what I do all day writing tailwind classes.

00:26:17
<transcript>: and styling

00:26:18
jammontoast: @SalkinvonBach What do you hate about web devs?

00:26:21
<transcript>: And styling html stuff.

00:26:21
<transcript>: feels really

00:26:21
thdxr: I did firmware for 6 months

00:26:24
<transcript>: Feels really dumb when I think about hardware and firmware.

00:26:24
<transcript>: i don't even know how

00:26:26
thdxr: I liked it a lot

00:26:27
<transcript>: I don't even know how to think about hardware and firmware.

00:26:27
<transcript>: like

00:26:27
daglee: Say it 200 more times? By then even the correct way will sound wrong?

00:26:30
<transcript>: Like I don't I don't know anything about hardware or firmware.

00:26:35
<transcript>: Okay.

00:26:41
<transcript>: I'm going to turn on this other camera. I'm gonna walk around. The audio is gonna suck.

00:26:41
<transcript>: so

00:26:43
<transcript>: So, I'm sorry.

00:26:43
<transcript>: i'm gonna do this entire

00:26:51
<transcript>: I'm gonna do this entire tour with a like, a little road shotgun mic that's mounted on my little gimbal. But I'm gonna walk around with.

00:26:51
<transcript>: and

00:26:55
<transcript>: And I tried to put like some obs effects on it. This mic is heavily.

00:27:04
<transcript>: Processed. Like there's a lot of background noise removal and EQ work and stuff I've done to get my voice sat.

00:27:04
<transcript>: this amazing

00:27:05
<transcript>: This amazing.

00:27:05
<transcript>: i mean it's pretty

00:27:11
<transcript>: I mean, it's pretty amazing, right? And the keyboard sounds really amazing with this mic. I'll talk about it in the tour.

00:27:14
<transcript>: This mic over here is guard.

00:27:15
<transcript>: guardian

00:27:15
<transcript>: guardian it will not

00:27:17
<transcript>: Guardian, it will not sound great.

00:27:17
<transcript>: so there's that

00:27:22
<transcript>: So there's that. And also, I don't know how long I can hold a gimbal before I get really tired.

00:27:25
<transcript>: So we might have to take breaks.

00:27:25
<transcript>: do

00:27:26
salkinvonbach: I don't like it LUL

00:27:32
thdxr: wait did no one else pay for tickets for this tour?

00:27:40
<transcript>: Do this in jumps. Also, I'm assuming walking around the office holding a gimbal, I'm gonna get hot and sweaty. So I opened a window right now. I'm freezing. So we're dealing with that. I've got right now. Too cold. Probably gonna get too hot. Oh, I wanted to drink my coffee first, but this is taking forever. It's not even coffee.

00:27:45
stroopwafel26: you guys got tickets?

00:27:45
fragaverage: hi hi hi

00:27:47
<transcript>: We'll just go ahead and start the tour. I'll drink the drink.

00:27:47
<transcript>: when we

00:27:52
joshuajebaraj: Do you use any software for audios like removing bg sound

00:27:54
salkinvonbach: @jammontoast That's a loaded question for me and I do not want to start getting into a rant and get banned

00:27:55
<transcript>: When we take a break because I will inevitably need to take a break. Frag is here. I'm so glad I didn't insert yet. Frag, I'm doing an office tour tour.

00:28:00
<transcript>: You did firmware for six months back. We got to output this on the podcast now.

00:28:04
<transcript>: We're gonna talk about firmware.

00:28:04
<transcript>: you can tell me what first

00:28:04
jammontoast: @SalkinvonBach Fair. LUL

00:28:05
<transcript>: You can tell me what first.

00:28:05
<transcript>: i just

00:28:07
nft_scam: pepeD office tour

00:28:07
fragaverage: ooooh THE tour

00:28:09
<transcript>: I just know I have to update firmware on things occasionally.

00:28:09
<transcript>: wait did no

00:28:13
<transcript>: Wait. Did no one else pay for tickets for this tour.

00:28:18
lowlevellearning: its firm because its in between HARDware and SOFTware :)

00:28:22
<transcript>: It's funny. Okay, Ztour, we're doing it. It's the first one, frag. And you're not late. You're just in time. Because I'm gonna turn it on right now. Let's see.

00:28:22
<transcript>: hang on

00:28:25
<transcript>: Hang on one second. I'll be right back.

00:28:51
laytanl_: The suspense NotLikeThis

00:28:54
salkinvonbach: Let's just summarize it as - they're the reason the internet and all modern end user computing is broken

00:28:55
thdxr: curious to see what the latency of this wireless HDMI is like

00:29:01
fragaverage: @LowLevelLearning WELL FUCK!

00:29:03
<transcript>: Okay. I'm also realizing I'm not gonna be able to see chat while I'm like explaining things.

00:29:03
<transcript>: that's gonna be weird

00:29:06
<transcript>: That's gonna be weird. Oh, maybe I could pull up on my phone. Let's do that.

00:29:09
jammontoast: That is massively overkill for this... surely!? LUL

00:29:10
nft_scam: PoroSad nyoooo

00:29:11
salkinvonbach: I do think css is cool though

00:29:14
<transcript>: I do not have a teleprompter with Twitch chat on my gimbal that would be.

00:29:14
<transcript>: interesting

00:29:15
<transcript>: Interesting.

00:29:17
salkinvonbach: Css is magic

00:29:18
o_fruit_o: I feel inadequate based from the things chat has done workwise. LUL

00:29:23
<transcript>: Yeah. We'll see what the latency's like. I don't think it's bad. And the audio's coming over the same thing. So it should all be fine.

00:29:30
<transcript>: It's firm because it's in between hardware and software that makes a ton of sense, actually.

00:29:36
laytanl_: Overkill is the motto of this channel lol

00:29:38
<transcript>: So. But how is it between so it's just like software that's really, really low level. Is that what you mean by between the hardware and the software.

00:29:38
<transcript>: firm

00:29:40
lowlevellearning: yeyeye

00:29:40
<transcript>: Firm.

00:29:43
<transcript>: You saw my thing so should follow.

00:29:50
<transcript>: It so right now, I just passed everything up, and I'm waiting for the camera to sync.

00:29:55
thdxr: my firmware work was on a Linux soc so it didn't feel much different from backend work

00:29:55
<transcript>: Okay, let's see if it's working. Hang on.

00:30:00
<transcript>: I got a mobile scene. There it is.

00:30:03
<transcript>: Oh, the audio. Okay.

00:30:06
<transcript>: I'm a. Jessing.

00:30:09
kociqq: ayezeePoggers

00:30:14
<transcript>: So this is new. The audio is gonna sound awful.

<transcript>: No, that's whispers.

00:30:43
<transcript>: can you see

00:30:46
laytanl_: Hello chat!

00:30:47
thdxr: is this on a gimbal or are you holding it still

00:30:47
<transcript>: Can you see how shake it is? Holding it with one hand.

00:30:47
<transcript>: where

00:30:48
0x80h: Nice, looks like a teleprompt

00:30:49
<transcript>: Where is chat.

00:30:50
kociqq: it's okay

00:30:51

00:31:10
o_fruit_o: Wow! MacStudio!

00:31:19
marcusbuer: damn that's a big soft box

00:31:20
danielgerep: Start from the door =)

00:31:21
<transcript>: 's Only a thirty five millimeter lens. So, like, I only show so much at one time, I guess. But I'm gonna, like, dive in to some weird, nitty gritty stuff, like on the equipment and all that. But first.

00:31:21
<transcript>: first we're

00:31:22
<transcript>: First we're gonna start.

00:31:23
nft_scam: the setup is crazy

00:31:23
tuugen3213: the lighitng looks like this is rendered in a game engine lool

00:31:25
stroopwafel26: I love how everything needs to be huge on your XDR for the stream so you're not even using the XDR's space fully now

00:31:25
<transcript>: Rent starts with lego building.

00:31:29
kociqq: this is quality

00:31:30
kociqq: holy

00:31:30
<transcript>: I'll let me know if the stream is completely stopped or something.

00:31:30
<transcript>: oh

00:31:34
<transcript>: Oh, wait. I'm gonna try. Not all that makes this a lot better.

00:31:35
nft_scam: oooooooo

00:31:39
<transcript>: Is that a lot better.

00:31:40
salkinvonbach: I like where this is going

00:31:44
kociqq: nice

00:31:44
traylortrash84: Legos are the best

00:31:45
salkinvonbach: I miss lego

00:31:46
winter_squirrel: let there be light!

00:31:50
o_fruit_o: Oooooooooohhhhh Aaaaaaaaaaahhhh

00:31:50
<transcript>: Okay, so these are my lego buildings. What you see behind me? Every single day on twitch, while every single day livestream, which is not very many days.

00:31:52

<transcript>: i mean

00:40:51
<transcript>: I mean, I'm staring out of the desk.

00:40:51
<transcript>: so

00:40:54
matty_twoshoes: which mac studio was that again?

00:40:56
<transcript>: So let's see this start by millimeter is going to be a problem.

00:41:01
<transcript>: Use a Pro xtr display from Apple and Mac studio.

00:41:07
<transcript>: This is my original mode. Eighty s first mode keyboard I got.

00:41:07
<transcript>: gmk

00:41:09
<transcript>: Gmk dracula keycaps on it.

00:41:09
<transcript>: apple

00:41:15
<transcript>: Apple trackpad Well, Stream Deck things, but they're so hideous, but they're very useful.

00:41:15
<transcript>: i really wish it wasn't

00:41:17
<transcript>: I really wish it wasn't on my desk.

00:41:23
<transcript>: I do this. Okay. So let's talk about my audio setup for my main camera. So this is my main.

00:41:27
<transcript>: Camera right buying the screen where twitch Ted is.

00:41:31
<transcript>: This is a sonya. Seven, S, three.

00:41:32
riv_ar0: you got all so clean

00:41:35
nexxeln: the most expensive one @Matty_TwoShoes

00:41:38
<transcript>: And the way I do audio, the way the reason my keyboard sounds good is really like.

00:41:38
<transcript>: half the

00:41:41
<transcript>: Half the keyboard in half.

00:41:41
<transcript>: this microphone

00:41:43
<transcript>: This microphone. Here.

00:41:46
<transcript>: So using a shotgun mic.

00:41:48
<transcript>: Makes for really good.

00:41:48
<transcript>: keyboard sound

00:41:48
fragaverage: I like the look of the new Streamdeck, but I have a Loupedeck already

00:41:50
<transcript>: Keyboard sound.

00:41:50
<transcript>: like

00:41:51
riv_ar0: You clean your office every day?

00:41:57
<transcript>: Like if you're using so this condenser mic. I think they're called connected. No, I don't know if they're called.

00:41:57
<transcript>: but this essence

00:41:58
<transcript>: But this essence.

00:41:58
<transcript>: whatever they are

00:42:00
<transcript>: Whatever they are, seven, B.

00:42:03
<transcript>: Does not pick up the keyboard like it just picks up your voice.

00:42:03
<transcript>: whereas this thing

00:42:07
<transcript>: Whereas this thing overhead fix up my voice and it picks up.

00:42:07
<transcript>: the keyboard

00:42:09
<transcript>: The keyboard.

00:42:09
<transcript>: i have

00:42:10
<transcript>: I have.

00:42:11
matty_twoshoes: @nexxeln lol i was more curious which chip/ram etc

00:42:16
thdxr: lol adam my sm7b is on the exact same arm

00:42:20
<transcript>: It must be I think this rig I'm holding must be heavier than I think.

00:42:20
thdxr: I actually don't like it too much

00:42:27
<transcript>: Listen I type all day that's all I did I just type.

00:42:31
<transcript>: Okay. So the ASE industry the way audio works.

00:42:31
<transcript>: this

00:42:32
<transcript>: This.

00:42:32
<transcript>: mic

00:42:33
<transcript>: Mic.

00:42:33
<transcript>: has a really

00:42:38
<transcript>: Has a really long xlr cable that runs into.

00:42:38
<transcript>: this

00:42:40
<transcript>: This apollo Twin X.

00:42:40
<transcript>: which is my

00:42:43
<transcript>: Which is my audio interface. It's plugged into my Mac.

00:42:43
<transcript>: through just like

00:42:46
<transcript>: Through just like a thunderbolt cable.

00:42:53
<transcript>: But what it does is it does a bunch of realtime processing, like on the audio interface. So does background removal. And.

00:42:53
<transcript>: eq

00:42:53
salkinvonbach: What's that? Mkh50?

00:42:53
unq_za: @Matty_TwoShoes just taking a guess: m1 ultra & 64gb

00:42:56
<transcript>: Eq and compression and all this stuff.

00:42:58
daglee: Hopefully your wife wont see how much out of breath you are... she would make so much fun of you.

00:43:00
<transcript>: And then I send audio out.

00:43:04
<transcript>: With these balanced quarter inch cables.

00:43:04
<transcript>: here

00:43:05
<transcript>: Here.

00:43:05
<transcript>: and

00:43:08
thdxr: I really want that apollo twin but linux :(

00:43:09
<transcript>: And they go all the way over here into my camera. Let's go over.

00:43:10
salkinvonbach: How to ruin your audio kek

00:43:17
<transcript>: So then the mic, the output from the.

00:43:17
<transcript>: audio

00:43:18
matty_twoshoes: @unq_za also my assumption LUL  adam doesn't do half-spec

00:43:22
<transcript>: Audio based come all the way up over here into my camera with this xlr adapter.

00:43:22
<transcript>: might be

00:43:23
<transcript>: Might be looking at it.

00:43:34
<transcript>: So that's where the audio interfaces the audio into the camera. The reason I do that is so that when the camera, like, sendation my out to my computer.

00:43:41
<transcript>: It's already got audio on it. It's already in sync. So the hdi feed has my good audio.

00:43:41
<transcript>: with the video

00:43:43
salkinvonbach: This is so backwards

00:43:43
<transcript>: With the video, which just makes a lot of things easier.

00:43:45
<transcript>: Make streaming easier.

00:43:45
<transcript>: it makes

00:43:47
salkinvonbach: Lol

00:43:49
<transcript>: It makes recording easier. So I record.

00:43:52
<transcript>: Ninja.

00:43:55
<transcript>: Recorders.

00:43:59
<transcript>: So for like YouTube and whatever else I record for.

00:43:59
<transcript>: so

00:44:01
<transcript>: So, yeah, this is a Sonia.

00:44:04
<transcript>: Three, it's behind the teleprompter.

00:44:04
<transcript>: proper

00:44:05
thdxr: @SalkinvonBach nope

00:44:06
matty_twoshoes: oh you don't record on the mac, true...

00:44:06
<transcript>: Proper people.

00:44:12
<transcript>: I think that one has like a thirty five millimeter one eight lens on it.

00:44:15
<transcript>: Which is better with the A seven S for ease because.

00:44:19
<transcript>: Breathing compensation.

00:44:26
matty_twoshoes: but then you only record what you get from the cameras? not the actual stream itself?

00:44:28
<transcript>: So that's a really nice sunny lenses. They focus really bad, but it just means like when you move in out of focus, the background kind of shifts.

00:44:28
<transcript>: like

00:44:32
<transcript>: Like the scale of the frame changes, does that make sense.

00:44:32
<transcript>: and

00:44:36
<transcript>: And they're nicer lenses do that pretty badly. And.

00:44:37
<transcript>: Can't handle it.

00:44:37
<transcript>: the sunny

00:44:41
<transcript>: The sunny seven floors, which I'll show you those two.

00:44:48
<transcript>: Focus reading paths so you can put actual engine on them and just have a little crop.

00:44:51
<transcript>: So I send all my all my cameras.

00:44:54
<transcript>: The hdmi out from the camera.

00:44:54
<transcript>: goes

00:44:55
<transcript>: Goes into.

00:44:55
<transcript>: one of these things

00:44:57
<transcript>: One of these things. Typically.

00:44:57
<transcript>: it's like an hdm

00:45:04
<transcript>: It's like an hdmi switcher. And then I can switch between recording on The Ninja.

00:45:04
<transcript>: or sending

00:45:06
<transcript>: Or sending to my computer for.

00:45:13
<transcript>: Here.

00:45:18
<transcript>: This is my key light giant. I'm gonna get the.

00:45:18
<transcript>: light

00:45:20
<transcript>: Light Dome.

00:45:22
<transcript>: In the entire frame.

00:45:22
<transcript>: yeah

00:45:29
<transcript>: Yeah, you can see it, right? It's a giant parabolic lightum, just like it's a really soft light.

00:45:32
schrew: oh so that's why it's hot

00:45:32
<transcript>: That's like right on my face.

00:45:32
<transcript>: i got

00:45:38
<transcript>: I got filled lights there on the other side. So I'm looking at this. I'm really optimizing for this shot right here.

00:45:38
<transcript>: i'm looking

00:45:39
usamabuttar: love the aesthetics

00:45:41
<transcript>: I'm looking at the teleprompter.

00:45:42
schrew: you have the SUN next to your head

00:45:46
<transcript>: All the lighting is kind of based off that there's another light here above me.

00:45:49
<transcript>: That's like a hair light.

00:45:50
salkinvonbach: @thdxr do you mean about the mic?

00:45:51
<transcript>: Just a smaller.

00:45:51
<transcript>: ls

00:45:53
<transcript>: Ls, sixty.

00:45:57
<transcript>: So my key light is an aperture. Three hundred X.

00:46:00
<transcript>: Both the fill and the hair light.

00:46:00
<transcript>: are sixty

00:46:04
<transcript>: Are sixty s's. This one over here is a six hundred.

00:46:06
temin: WAYTOODANK

00:46:08
<transcript>: Which is like.

00:46:08
<transcript>: hard to

00:46:12
<transcript>: Hard to look at it. Like hurts. My eyes is so bright.

00:46:12
<transcript>: but if i

00:46:17
<transcript>: But if I want to light up the whole room and make it brighter or something like this, it's great.

00:46:18
burakdotto: WAYTOODANK

00:46:20
<transcript>: Got a lamp in the corner.

00:46:30
<transcript>: That plant is actually living. I don't know how it's still living because I always have a lights up in here and the curtains. Both. It's so dark.

00:46:33
salkinvonbach: Why do you have a 600d LUL

00:46:33
<transcript>: Okay. So then.

00:46:34
matty_twoshoes: WAYTOODARK

00:46:35
flywillig: its dyying actually

00:46:36
<transcript>: Talks about the keyboard talked about.

00:46:41
nikolaxhristov: plant PogChamp

00:46:46
<transcript>: So this mic. I guess I use it on the podcast because it is better when my kids are running around. You don't hear them so loudly outside my office.

00:46:52
<transcript>: Whereas the shotgun mic overhead picks up every single thing that happens in my house.

00:46:52
<transcript>: this is

00:46:54
<transcript>: This is very noisy.

00:46:59
<transcript>: So yeah, I do use this one just for the podcast when I'm recording during the day with backs.

00:46:59
<transcript>: back

00:47:02
<transcript>: Back plug the podcast. That'd be great. Great timing.

00:47:07
<transcript>: So this camera is the Sony A seven, four.

00:47:07
<transcript>: got a

00:47:07
thdxr: tomorrow.fm

00:47:09
salkinvonbach: We don't even keep one in the actual studio

00:47:09
<transcript>: Got a 35 millimeter one.

00:47:09
<transcript>: four on it

00:47:10
thdxr: listen to it!

00:47:11
<transcript>: Four on it.

00:47:21
<transcript>: Sony Wins. So this rig actually is what I use. Like if I'm recording YouTube, I'm just setting it over in the corner with kind of all this stuff in the background.

00:47:21
<transcript>: and it's

00:47:24
nexxeln: !podcast

00:47:28
<transcript>: And it's on this, like monopod. Let's get all this equipment already on it so I can just move it around. And it's got everything already ready to go.

00:47:35
<transcript>: It's got an audio recorder because I'm not recording with the overhead mic in that setting. It's got a new.

00:47:35
nexxeln: add a podcast command

00:47:41
<transcript>: Switcher.

00:47:47
<transcript>: Okay. I'm gonna take a break because it's six heavy. One second.

00:48:10
<transcript>: I have not been reading chat. What was that noise? What just happened? Oh, thank you to follow forsaken let me try off this slide so bright.

00:48:21
salkinvonbach: Pro tip - you can get a used A7RIV for way less than you can sell an A7IV for

00:48:26
<transcript>: I think the biggest problem with all these lights, they're so hot it gets so ridiculously hot in here when, like all of their on so I can only stream for so long before I start sweating.

00:48:33
<transcript>: Logical Brian, thank you for the follow bcf and unc and hot shot and qlmm.

00:48:33
<transcript>: thank you for the follow

00:48:36
<transcript>: Thank you for the follows.

00:48:50
thdxr: how is the autofocus on A7RIV

00:48:50
caasidev: great setup Adam!!

00:48:50
<transcript>: So I've always read all the messages in chat and I feel really weird not going back and reading every single message, but also that would be really, really boring for you guys. So I'm not going to.

00:48:50
<transcript>: i'm just gonna

00:48:51
lukeyfam15: How are you?

00:48:53
<transcript>: I'm just gonna pretend they didn't happen.

00:48:57
<transcript>: But I'm gonna skim.

00:48:57
<transcript>: doesn't

00:48:59
<transcript>: Doesn't do half spec.

00:49:00
matty_twoshoes: okay here was my question: which mac studio model?

00:49:05
<transcript>: You don't record on the Mac? I do. Oh, no, I don't record like if I.

00:49:05
<transcript>: feel so

00:49:11
<transcript>: Feel so dumb saying when I did I've done like seven YouTube videos. So I'm still very new to YouTube.

00:49:11
<transcript>: but

00:49:12
<transcript>: But.

00:49:12
<transcript>: youtube i record

00:49:14
<transcript>: Youtube. I record to the ninja V. That's right.

00:49:14
<transcript>: then

00:49:19
<transcript>: Then you only record what you get from the cameras, not the actual stream itself.

00:49:26
<transcript>: Yeah, right. Yeah. I just record.

00:49:26
<transcript>: just the camera

00:49:28
<transcript>: Just the camera. That's right.

00:49:32
<transcript>: You have the sun next to your head, etc.

00:49:38
<transcript>: Why do you have a six hundred D? I actually got it because.

00:49:40
<transcript>: I was.

00:49:44
<transcript>: So dumb. I was filming some stuff with the lego people.

00:49:44
<transcript>: and

00:49:55
<transcript>: And you need a tunnel light with this little tiny macro lens. I have it's like a fisheye macro lens, where you can, like, get in there in the buildings with the people. I am such a nerd. I'm saying it out loud. I am such a nerd.

00:49:55
<transcript>: like as

00:49:59
salkinvonbach: Oh now it makes sense

00:50:00
<transcript>: Like as I'm thinking about the words that are coming out on that mouth, it's occurring to me.

00:50:05
<transcript>: Yeah. So I needed a ton of light to light those buildings anyway.

00:50:23
<transcript>: We don't even keep wanting access to that. Oh, tomorrow. That's right. Listen to it podcast. We need to add a command. I really do pro tip you can get a used AR a seven R four for way lesson. You can sell an A seven four academic. Gotcha. That's the one that's good for like stills. Mostly. Right.

00:50:23
<transcript>: aut

00:50:25
<transcript>: Autofocus on the A seven.

00:50:25
<transcript>: four

00:50:31
<transcript>: Four and a seven. S. Three are the same. And they're awesome. I mean, there might be minor differences, but.

00:50:35
<transcript>: They're both great. It's Sony autofocus is so good.

00:50:35
<transcript>: which

00:50:38
<transcript>: Which Max? Studio model.

00:50:41
<transcript>: Which Mac Studio model is this.

00:50:46
<transcript>: Are there different models. It's got a macs, it's whatever the best processor is.

00:50:52
<transcript>: That the only difference in the model or is it I didn't know there were different models, actually.

00:50:53
salkinvonbach: Oh ye we use the a7r iv in the photography studio

00:50:57
mjewl: Favourite Lego set?

00:50:57
nexxeln: its the most expensive one i told you LUL

00:50:58
matty_twoshoes: yeah okay i had assumed, yeah like what chip was inside

00:51:04
<transcript>: So I feel like there was something deadframe. Thank you so much for that follow. I feel something else I was gonna talk about or get into? Oh.

00:51:04
<transcript>: if

00:51:05
salkinvonbach: M1 max?

00:51:06
matty_twoshoes: LUL i know @nexxeln

00:51:09
<transcript>: If you're new and you haven't heard my keyboard and you want to hear what I just got done.

00:51:13
<transcript>: Talking about how great the shock and make might sounds.

00:51:17
<transcript>: Like.

00:51:21
o_fruit_o: Where do you keep the bodies?

00:51:22
<transcript>: That's not actually how fast I Typed that's way too fast.

00:51:22
laytanl_: What books DO you read?

00:51:25
<transcript>: But you can hear the keys that way.

00:51:27
salkinvonbach: Whats the mic

00:51:28
nft_scam: whats the keyboard again?

00:51:29
physotronic: what keyboard do you have? what switches? brown?

00:51:31
salkinvonbach: Mkh50?

00:51:31
daglee: Why is it named Mac Pro and not Big Mac?!

00:51:35
<transcript>: Okay. Where do you in one mac's? Where do you keep the bodies? What books do you read? Great question laden. I have like 150 audible books.

00:51:35
<transcript>: because

00:51:46
thdxr: did David make your stingers also?

00:51:46
marcusbuer: same mic for keyboard and voice, or dedicated mic for the keyboard?

00:51:55
<transcript>: because when i was at statmeues the first time eli my cofounder was like sure buy all the books you want i want you to be smart and so i would just buy books in bulk not just like wait for the free credit every month just buy them like face value so i have tons and tons of books and they just cover the gamut my favorite books to listen to on walks are biography

00:51:55
<transcript>: love

00:51:55
matty_twoshoes: oh duh it's all in the ABOUT section on the profile people

00:52:03
riv_ar0: YOU FEED ALL YOUR HOUSE WHIT SOLAR ENERGY???

00:52:04
<transcript>: Love. What's his name? Walter. Walter isaacson. All of his biographies listen to Mall. They're all great. Leonardo. Especially good.

00:52:12
<transcript>: What keeps oh, I didn't even really break down what keyboards are it's hard when you're panting because you're out of shape and you're carrying a gimbal.

00:52:22
<transcript>: So the keyboards, their mode, all four of my key. Four of my keyboards. One, two, three, four, five of my keyboards are mode keyboards. And the sixth one that I haven't built yet.

00:52:22
<transcript>: i've got

00:52:26
schrew: Just read edward snowdens biography, it was good! First book I've read in quite some time

00:52:26
cowfacedude99: guess I missed your house tour.

00:52:27
<transcript>: I've got two mode, sixty five S, two mod, eighty S, and two modes on it.

00:52:27
<transcript>: this

00:52:31
<transcript>: This the one I'm using around now that you just heard is a mode ad with.

00:52:34
<transcript>: Mode.

00:52:39
<transcript>: Those switches. Mode. Signal, switches.

00:52:53
<transcript>: Forgot for a second there. So mode signal switches. They are very well done and lubed because Mode did it for me. I did not do these the other keyboards. I did the lubing and they don't sound as good.

00:53:00
<transcript>: Actually, the other sonnet, my black sonet. They did the looping for me as well. So those two sound pretty great.

00:53:04
<transcript>: Is that did I answer the whole question.

00:53:04
<transcript>: what keyboard

00:53:08
<transcript>: What keyboard. Oh, welcome to Chat fizo, by the way.

00:53:15
<transcript>: What's? The mic? Oh, the mic is a synchron. Yeah, I didn't really tell you what any of this stuff is. It's a Sennheiser.

00:53:15
<transcript>: mk

00:53:19
<transcript>: Mkh. Fifty P. Forty Eight is the mic.

00:53:25
salkinvonbach: I knew it

00:53:25
<transcript>: I told you the cameras. So I've got the two, a seven, S, threes. And then.

00:53:25
<transcript>: while the two a seven

00:53:28
<transcript>: While the two a seven, four is the one was on the gimbal.

00:53:32
salkinvonbach: It sounds like one

00:53:36
<transcript>: The lenses are all over the place, like the one I use when I go to the screen like this lens is like.

00:53:36
<transcript>: it's a fisheye

00:53:39
<transcript>: It's a fisheye. It's like a fourteen millimeter.

00:53:39
<transcript>: gmast

00:53:42
<transcript>: Gmaster Sony lens.

00:53:42
<transcript>: because

00:53:44
<transcript>: Because I've kind of got it right on top of me.

00:53:52
<transcript>: And then the main view. This is a thirty five millimeter Sony lens. I've got a thirty five millimeter on that one.

00:53:52
<transcript>: then i think that

00:53:53
cowfacedude99: he bought a advantage 360 for the hype. and gave it away LUL

00:53:59
<transcript>: Then I think that when I was using thirty five millimeter as well. But I use like a ninety millimeter macro. This really good.

00:54:07
dalt_kb: when do you use the airpods max

00:54:08
<transcript>: And then I've got a fifty one, two. It's also really good, but the framing with the fifty S is hard to take advantage of.

00:54:10
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:54:19
<transcript>: I entered switches for fizo mkh Fifty. That's right, Nicholas. Why is it named Mac Pro and not Big Mac.

00:54:21
<transcript>: This should be a Big Mac.

00:54:21
<transcript>: did david make

00:54:23
<transcript>: Did David make your Stingers also.

00:54:23
<transcript>: yes

00:54:30
jiggaman98: Wow, u have amazing eyes dude.

00:54:44
<transcript>: Yes. Wait. Stingers. What are stickingers? Stingers like the transitions actually know those are programmatic. You can submit a PR to my repo and you can make my Stingers, along with all the people who made the one that are there. It's a little like dots that move around. It was david's idea. He designed it, but the actual implementation is community driven.

00:54:59
<transcript>: Same mic for keyboard invoice or dedicated micro keyboard. Great question, Marcus. It's St mic, and I think it sounds pretty good, but I have considered putting a mic down next to my keyboard just so I could tune the audio like the volume level.

00:54:59
<transcript>: just for the

00:55:09
<transcript>: Just for the keyboard that would be going the extra mile and I generally go the extra mile so that would make sense for me to do that at some point. Thanks jojo. The follow twitch marketer.

00:55:14
physotronic: adamdotdev did you say you are using optical switches from modedesigns? or you said obscure linear switches?

00:55:27
<transcript>: In the about section. Yeah, I've got most of my equipment in the about section. That's right. You feed all your house with solar energy. That's right, riv. Newly installed solar energy. We just did a giant, like, twenty six kilowatt hours.

00:55:35
<transcript>: True. Just read Edward snowden's biography. It was good first book I've read in quite some time. I love biographies. I don't know something about it.

00:55:35
<transcript>: does it for me

00:55:37
<transcript>: Does it for me.

00:55:37
<transcript>: you

00:55:42
salkinvonbach: I don't get the obsession with modern cherry clones

00:55:47
<transcript>: You miss my house tour? Cow face. I have not done a house drawer. I could walk around the house with the gimbal. My wife would probably get kind of pissed. She'd be like, really? We're trying to have breakfast.

00:55:48
<transcript>: Maybe don't put us on Twitch.

00:55:48
<transcript>: but maybe

00:55:53
<transcript>: But maybe I could plan that I'll plan a little.

00:55:53
<transcript>: house tour at some point

00:55:54
nexxeln: i use gateron browns, they're so nice

00:55:58
<transcript>: House tour at some point where everyone's prepared and not surprised when I put a camera in their face.

00:56:04
<transcript>: Bought an advantage to sixty for the Hype and gave it away to do that. Yeah.

00:56:06
iamprozod: send her to a pedicure session then do a housetour Kappa

00:56:18
<transcript>: When you use the airpods Matt never thought I was gonna say if you notice when I was looking at my desk, there's a pair of airpod maxes that sit down here and they're not charged because I haven't used them in literal months. I don't really love them.

00:56:18
<transcript>: i

00:56:24
<transcript>: I originally thought like they're the bestlooking headphone. And most things I choose are because they're the best looking.

00:56:24
<transcript>: and

00:56:32
<transcript>: And I use them for a while, but then I just started using these again. These are my sennheiser, whatever they are. Hd. Six hundred and fifty S or something.

00:56:38
<transcript>: Let's see. Welcome to Chat jigga Man. I have amazing eyes.

00:56:38
<transcript>: really

00:56:40
<transcript>: Really.

00:56:40
salkinvonbach: The coolest thing in this whole office is your love for your family. Now that's something that people can get jealous of.

00:56:43
<transcript>: Here. I'll Zoom in by doing a big face.

00:56:50
<transcript>: Amazing guys. Actually, I say that was surprising tone, but I did win best size in high school.

00:56:50
<transcript>: i'm just saying

00:56:54
<transcript>: I'm just saying I was the male best. I.

00:56:56
<transcript>: Don't know.

00:56:56
<transcript>: apparently

00:56:58
<transcript>: Apparently apparently my ipads are good.

00:56:59
marcusbuer: LUL

00:56:59
thdxr: I won best dancer

00:57:01
thdxr: believe it or not

00:57:04
<transcript>: What about them? Is it that they're the blue, blueness.

00:57:04
<transcript>: fizzotro

00:57:06
<transcript>: Fizzotro. It's our.

00:57:08
jiggaman98: I believe it.

00:57:09
<transcript>: The highlighting the highest.

00:57:09
<transcript>: is actually

00:57:13
nexxeln: i won nothing!

00:57:13
jiggaman98: The color.

00:57:14
<transcript>: Is actually harder for me to read it's like this weird red and.

00:57:14
<transcript>: it actually makes

00:57:20
jiggaman98: And they look kind.

00:57:22
<transcript>: It actually makes it harder. So did you say you were using optical switches from mode designs? Or you said, obscure linear switches. Their mode.

00:57:23
riv_ar0: some adviices for a cs student?

00:57:29
salkinvonbach: If you like HD650/600 you should try Audio technica R70x - upgrade in comfort, style and sound while same tuning

00:57:34
marcusbuer: @jiggaman98 indeed

00:57:35
<transcript>: Signal. It's their tactile, not linear switches. I do use the mode reflex, I think is the name for their linear switches. I do use those on one of my laptop or one of my keyboards.

00:57:44
<transcript>: Oh, I know. There's something else I'm going to show. I'll show you my office closet, which has a big server rack and a bunch of junk in it. We'll go into that in just a second.

00:57:49
<transcript>: Don't get the obsession with modern cherry clones. I use Gatoron Browns. They're so nice.

00:57:54
<transcript>: Cinderer to petic your session, then do a house tour.

00:57:54
<transcript>: if my kids

00:57:57
salkinvonbach: And less expensive actually

00:58:00
<transcript>: If my kids, if my kids won't even library today or something and they take off, then yeah, we'll walk around upstairs.

00:58:16
<transcript>: The coolest thing in this whole office is you're love your family. Now, that's something that people can get jealous of. Well, that's so kind. Nicholas. I do love my family very much. I won best dancer. Are you kidding me, derek's? Okay, we're gonna have a high school superlatives episode on tomorrow.

00:58:18
<transcript>: Sounds fun.

00:59:00
<transcript>: like

<transcript>: Like parsing the world, and then like spitting out useful.

00:59:06
<transcript>: Nuggets.

00:59:06
<transcript>: and

00:59:13
<transcript>: And like, you see stuff, and you can call it out. I just don't. I don't see things. I don't know.

00:59:23
rohithgilla: Btw adam, can you randomise your tee colour üëÄ

00:59:33
<transcript>: Feel like as a technologist, I have very little to say. I have very little, like, in terms of recommendations. I just like, I like doing stuff. I like using all this stuff, but I never, like, get done using something. And I'm like, here's why this is good. I know because I'm smart. Here's why this is good. I just don't have that in me. I don't know what that is like. I don't feel like I have a lot of.

00:59:35
<transcript>: Insights.

00:59:38
rohithgilla: Like, twitch decide, what you wear for a week

00:59:39
thdxr: @rohithgilla today!

00:59:39
rohithgilla: üòõ

00:59:42
<transcript>: Thoughts was the best word. That was the word that came first. I think that was best. I just don't have a lot of thoughts. I don't think much.

00:59:54
<transcript>: So someone else we have hopefully in chat has good advice for cs student I'm not the best with advice. Also I've had a very weird career instead of life experiences that don't.

00:59:54
<transcript>: they're not

00:59:59
rohithgilla: @thdxr thanks, btw raised a bug about go example not working on sst

01:00:02
grasp5533: Adam how did you land your first client?

01:00:15
<transcript>: They're not repeatable, necessarily. At least it doesn't feel like it to me if you have HD, six hundred and fifty. Six hundred it is. Six hundred and fifty. Yes. Try Iotechnicana technica technica R, seventy X, upgrading comfort, silence and on the same tuning. Okay. Hey, that's great advice, Nicholas. I will definitely never forget your name now, because we've had a lot of interactions today.

01:00:16
schrew: My advice to a CS student would be to build a resume early, and use your time in college to fill it with things that will help you get a job. Way more important than upping your GPA by some margin

01:00:18
<transcript>: Let's expand.

01:00:25
<transcript>: These. Oh, nice. I actually bought these. This is one of the few pieces of technology in my office that I've owned for, like, six, seven years.

01:00:29
<transcript>: So these have actually lasted. I've kept them around.

01:00:29
<transcript>: let's see

01:00:36
gerellt: Did you mention the chair?

01:00:40
<transcript>: Let's see. I bought new keyboard a few days ago. Logitech G Nine, One Five tactile switch with low profile keycaps. Are you enjoying it? Fi, though. That's the question.

01:00:40
<transcript>: with the japanese

01:00:49
thdxr: adam your chair looked super weird what is it

01:00:49
<transcript>: With the Japanese version is like two hundred and fifty Bucks. Wow. Okay. I know theo had lots of opinions on headphones, and I meant to try the headphones he always recommends.

01:00:55
fragaverage: Theo has lots of opinions. Period

01:00:56
thdxr: I have the theo headphones I like em

01:00:57
<transcript>: By the Way, I Adam, can you randomize your tea colors.

01:00:57
<transcript>: like

01:01:02
salkinvonbach: I also have lots of opinions on headphones

01:01:06
<transcript>: Like twitch. Decide what you wear for a week. Interesting. I own literally. If we did a closet tour, you would see that I own, like twelve of these black shirts.

01:01:06
<transcript>: it's literally

01:01:09
<transcript>: It's literally all I wear.

01:01:09
<transcript>: and i'm

01:01:10
salkinvonbach: I have like 50k in headphones

01:01:13
<transcript>: And I'm not trying to like, okay. So I know this fact. This is very damn.

01:01:13
<transcript>: i'm not trying

01:01:17
salkinvonbach: Lmao

01:01:24
<transcript>: I'm not trying to be einstein who wore the same thing every day, but I do see his point if I can wake up and not have to think about what I'm putting on and I can just throw on the exact same thing every morning.

01:01:34
vapor__dev: Fridge tour

01:01:35
<transcript>: I'm happier for it. I can already be staring at my phone, drifting off into whatever I'm gonna think about. And I'm not thinking about, like, I need to pick a shirt and pants. I don't think I'm Einstein.

01:01:35
<transcript>: but i

01:01:38
<transcript>: But I do see his point.

01:01:38
<transcript>: i wish i

01:01:43
<transcript>: I wish I didn't know that fact. Then some it could be like, Did you know einstein were the same thing every day? And like really.

01:01:43
<transcript>: know that

01:01:45
<transcript>: Know that.

01:01:52
<transcript>: Let's see. Rohie. Thanks. By the way. Raised a bug about Go example. Networking. Oh, yeah, you guys are talking. I'm sorry.

01:01:56
nullchefo: @thdxr Same.  I like em too

01:02:02
<transcript>: Did you. How did you land your first client? Okay, there's a story I can tell grasp. So I started as this freelance software developer back in 2009. Thank you so much for that follow time. Heck.

01:02:02
<transcript>: two

01:02:03
jiggaman98: In other words, you think you‚Äôre Einstein. LOL hahahah jk

01:02:04
<transcript>: 2009.

01:02:10
<transcript>: And it was on elant, which was later acquired by upwork.

01:02:10
<transcript>: which

01:02:16
<transcript>: Which may have now been acquired by something else. I don't know. But it was Elance. I had a profile on elance.

01:02:16
<transcript>: and

01:02:20
<transcript>: And someone named Gary yule in Florida.

01:02:23
thdxr: @jiggaman98 well right before that he said he has no thoughts so idk

01:02:25
<transcript>: Reached out to me and said, hey, I've got a fulltime job.

01:02:25
<transcript>: and i'd like to interview

01:02:28
<transcript>: And I'd like to interview you to see if you'd be good for it. He did contract work.

01:02:28
<transcript>: for

01:02:31
<transcript>: For like fintech companies.

01:02:33
<transcript>: And.

01:02:33
<transcript>: it was

01:02:39
<transcript>: It was net and I had never done any like profession. Well, I say that.

01:02:39
<transcript>: i had done

01:02:41
<transcript>: I had done so I studied ts in College.

01:02:41
<transcript>: and dropping

01:02:43
oetziofficial: Hi kruzWave

01:02:43
<transcript>: And dropping to three semesters.

01:02:48
<transcript>: And then I got a job at a local trucking company.

01:03:02
<transcript>: originally is an it like i was gonna help them with just it stuff like literally helping the ladies in the office get their printer working that's what i started doing but then i had studied cs i was really interested still in the idea of writing software

01:03:05
<transcript>: And I.

01:03:05
<transcript>: talked to the

01:03:10
<transcript>: Talked to the boss man, Eric, who owned the business. And I said, hey, listen.

01:03:10
<transcript>: your employees

01:03:24
salkinvonbach: @riv_ar0 get real experience. Focus on quality- not on "works well enough". College is pretty useless in practice- competence trumps all

01:03:29
<transcript>: Your employees do a lot of the same stuff every single day. And it seems like a lot of wasted time. Maybe I could help you by building some software that does some of this. It was their billing system was so like they scanned a thing to then, like, email it to somebody else that printed it and then Fax it to someone else. It was just like, this is dumb. Like we could save a lot of time. So.

01:03:29
<transcript>: he let

01:03:34
ayushsharma: You returned SUBprise

01:03:37
<transcript>: He let me in between my other responsibility of clearing printer Inc. From whatever.

01:03:37
<transcript>: he

01:03:44
<transcript>: He let me build out a little building system for them. And it worked, and it saved them a ton of time. And I built it with wind forms.

01:03:44
<transcript>: and

01:03:50
<transcript>: And that was in College. It was right after I failed out of College. So that was like 2007 or something.

01:03:56
thdxr: winforms was amazing

01:04:01
vapor__dev: Einstein had relativity, Adam has reactivity

01:04:04
<transcript>: So I did get, like a year of kind of like on my own building stuff for this trucking company automated all kinds of stuff, their billing and their pricing and their all this stuff that they do for ethanol sales or something.

01:04:16
<transcript>: I did that. And then I got that job with Gary in two thousand and nine. That was my first real job. And it was just off one call. I got a phone call with him.

01:04:16
<transcript>: and

01:04:23
<transcript>: And I was so nervous. And he was asking all these questions. I just read a bunch of books about C. Sharp. I was just like, I'm ready.

01:04:23
<transcript>: and

01:04:31
<transcript>: And I guess I did good enough. But he hired me. So I worked for twenty two dollars an hour for Gary. You will for.

01:04:31
<transcript>: a year

01:04:34
<transcript>: A year. So I think after we got married, my wife and I.

01:04:34
<transcript>: so i got married

01:04:40
<transcript>: So I got married in 2009, literally, the day after I got back from my honeymoon was my first day with Gary.

01:04:42
glamshatterskull: i got a php job like that back in the early 00s LUL

01:04:43
<transcript>: And the rest is history.

01:04:45
<transcript>: I remember being so excited.

01:04:48
glamshatterskull: literally read a book the night before

01:04:49
<transcript>: So excited about that job.

01:04:49
<transcript>: and

01:04:50
tymekdev: Just read the title. $50k would almost get my mortgage out of the window lol

01:04:56
<transcript>: And I mean the only job I had before that I think I had two jobs before that. I haven't read chat in, like ten minutes. I'm sorry. I'm gonna get back to it.

01:04:56
<transcript>: the job

01:04:59
<transcript>: The job I had before that.

01:04:59
<transcript>: was

01:05:02
sondreal: adamdo8DealWithIt

01:05:04
<transcript>: Was geek squad squad in College. So while I was in College, I worked at the geek squad fulltime.

01:05:04
<transcript>: like thirty

01:05:15
<transcript>: Like 30 plus hours a week because I had to pay for my College. I didn't come from money people. So if I swamp my money today, it's because I didn't come from it. My dad worked for the state for 30 years.

01:05:15
<transcript>: i think

01:05:18
<transcript>: I think my first year.

01:05:18
<transcript>: no really

01:05:34
<transcript>: No, really like said this out loud. I think I've had the thought, but I think my first year getting paid twenty two dollars an hour. I think I made more than my dad did after thirty years working for the state. So we always were like growing up. Paycheck to paycheck. I had three siblings. Still have three siblings.

01:05:38
<transcript>: So don't come from money. And we're in a pretty impoverished area like the ozarks not exactly.

01:05:41
<transcript>: Hyrol.

01:05:46
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't know. How did I get onto my life story.

01:05:46
<transcript>: what did someone

01:05:48
<transcript>: What did someone ask me.

01:05:53
<transcript>: How did you land your first class? I just saw the question. I've highlighted.

01:05:57
<transcript>: And then now I'm talking about my dad. And anyway.

01:05:57
<transcript>: yeah that was

01:06:00
<transcript>: Yeah. That was my first gig.

01:06:00
<transcript>: working for

01:06:02
<transcript>: Working for Gary.

01:06:03
thdxr: my dad worked for a hedgefund started from the bottom

01:06:05
<transcript>: After that first year.

01:06:05
<transcript>: i think

01:06:14
<transcript>: I think I doubled my income, like every year for five years. I think literally it was like I stepped up by double.

01:06:14
<transcript>: five years

01:06:19
glamshatterskull: yeah mom was a teacher.. i was sadly making more than her with my first job at an isp

01:06:21
<transcript>: Five years in a row, and then I quit because I saved up a lot of money that last year.

01:06:34
<transcript>: And started sent me these with my friend eli, and we had saved both of us. Saved up enough money to like go for a year without working or getting paid if we were working harder than ever on Sat music.

01:06:44
aaaaliou: I love that you remember your first client's name. Are you still in contact with them?

01:06:53
<transcript>: Yeah, okay. I'm gonna move on to the next message in chat and try and catch up because you guys are probably all laughing at me. My advice. So see, a student would be to build a resume early and use your time in College to fill it with things that will help you get a job way more important than upping your gpa by some margin. Did you mention the chair? Oh, the chair. Gerald, is a courtier.

01:06:53
<transcript>: i've gone through

01:06:59
<transcript>: I've gone through a few chairs in my day that auto Zoom in and so dumb I need to turn that off.

01:07:14
<transcript>: It's a core chair. It's really great. It's like setting on a medicine ball. So okay, prime sets on a medicine ball, right? I actually used to set on a medicine ball. I hate even saying this. It sounds so dumb. Like I used to do that. But I literally did.

01:07:14
<transcript>: when we were

01:07:17
rohithgilla: Inspiring story Adam, thanks for sharing ‚ù§Ô∏è

01:07:26
glamshatterskull: lots of people sit on medicine balls

01:07:26
<transcript>: When we were in a rental while we were building this house, I sat on a medicine ball because my wife said, it's really good for your back. So I did that for, like, two years, living in that rental and.

01:07:26
<transcript>: then when i

01:07:32
glamshatterskull: it's fine :D

01:07:38
tymekdev: @GlamShatterskull Teachers are so underpaid... I think I tripled my mom's salary already. I have 4 years of experience. She retired with almost 30 years...

01:07:46
<transcript>: Then when I moved in here, I bought an embody chair. I had always had herman Miller chairs. I bought it in body, and I tried to top myself in to, like, loving it. And it was nice. I liked it more than an air on, but I think it was worse than the metal, and it's a lot more expensive. So then my wife found this core chair on Instagram or something. It's basically, like setting up a medicine ball. Like, it rocks.

01:07:46
<transcript>: around

01:07:52
<transcript>: Around, but it's actually a chair, so I don't feel like I'm just copying prime. Does that make sense.

01:08:03
<transcript>: Chair looks super weird. Yeah, yeah, it acts. I'll show my chair up here in a second. When I show the closet all, I'll show the chair again. Theo has lots of opinions. Period. Has the feel headphones. You like them? Okay, good to know.

01:08:12
salkinvonbach: Oh ye totally missed the chair

01:08:15
<transcript>: Lots of pinnings. You have $50,000 in headphones. Nicholas. Holy Cow, that's a lot of headphones fridge tour. I don't even have a fridge in my office. I'm not like dax. That's one.

01:08:19
andom: Mom worked at kindergarten and I started to make more than her when I was 18 in my first software dev job I kind of felt bad to say how much I make to her

01:08:20
<transcript>: You think you're einstein? Yeah. In other words, exactly. Jiggle man.

01:08:28
salkinvonbach: It's Australian dollars but ye

01:08:37
<transcript>: Get real experience folks on quality not on workflow enough. College is pretty useless in practice. Compton Trump's all I did return to you Sha I'm back or are you? I am back. I'm back when forms was amazing.

01:08:37
<transcript>: shout out

01:08:40
<transcript>: Shout out to winforms.

01:08:41
glamshatterskull: @TymekDev big same... so sad. teachers deserve better

01:08:42
<transcript>: Adam has reactivity.

01:08:45
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:08:49
<transcript>: You got a php job like that back in the early Ops.

01:08:49
<transcript>: read a book

01:08:51
<transcript>: Read a book tonight before that's the way to do it.

01:08:57
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat timek. Just read the title. 50,000 would almost get my mortgage out of the window. Yeah.

01:08:57
<transcript>: so

01:08:59
gerellt: Did you use a stabilizer ring with the ball when you used it?

01:09:01
<transcript>: So it's seasons of life, my friends.

01:09:01
<transcript>: i

01:09:01
<transcript>: I.

01:09:01
<transcript>: yeah

01:09:06
<transcript>: Yeah. Our first house was like a $110,000.

01:09:06
<transcript>: house

01:09:08
<transcript>: House, back.

01:09:12
<transcript>: In west plains, where we kind of that's kind of where my wife and I grew up.

01:09:20
<transcript>: And that was a big deal when I was starting my career, making $22 an hour and.

01:09:27
<transcript>: You always have to start somewhere. So now it is crazy to think that I would spend fifty thousand dollars on just junk in my eyes.

01:09:37
<transcript>: But I make a lot more money now and I think generally devs don't spend enough on their office and just the place they spend all their time, their equipment.

01:09:37
<transcript>: like

01:09:39
tymekdev: a

01:09:45
<transcript>: Like, I don't know. Maybe we spend enough on our equipment. Everybody seems to buy the expensive macbooks and stuff. Jiggle Man, thank you so much for the follow.

01:09:45
<transcript>: also welcome

01:09:45
jiggaman98: I‚Äôm gonna follow you, you‚Äôre a winner and I like that!!!!!!

01:09:47
<transcript>: Also welcome to Chat timek.

01:09:47
<transcript>: my dad

01:09:49
<transcript>: My dad worked for a hedge fund. Started from the bottom.

01:09:50
tymekdev: Agreed. So many people skimp on decent keybard

01:09:58
<transcript>: That's funny. Mom was a teacher. Sadly, making more than her with the first job. Yeah, tech is crazy. We make a lot of money in tech.

01:09:58
<transcript>: and i know there's

01:10:07
fragaverage: I think we spend a lot of the computer itself, but not the rest

01:10:08
<transcript>: And I know there's reasons for that. It's sometimes hard for me to understand, but I love that you remember your first client's name? Are you still in contact with them? Yeah. It's a funny story game.

01:10:10
<transcript>: I mean, I worked with him for five years.

01:10:10
<transcript>: and

01:10:14
lukeyfam15: Cheer100

01:10:14
instafluff: i still use an ironing board as a standing desk LUL

01:10:22
<transcript>: And then after we started, stat muse eli got to know him. And we actually kind of hired him to work on statues in the early days. In the early days. Loki, thank you so much for the Bits luki.

01:10:22
<transcript>: i appreciate those

01:10:23
<transcript>: I appreciate those bits.

01:10:23
<transcript>: yeah

01:10:25
salkinvonbach: You also loose a lot of money in tech

01:10:26
<transcript>: Yeah. So I worked with Gary.

01:10:26
<transcript>: and in fact

01:10:32
vapor__dev: How were you doubling salary every year?

01:10:36
daglee: I spent $359 on my current laptop. It works fine. :) I have a real desktop though.

01:10:36
<transcript>: And in fact, Gary also hired someone named Jay Hill. That's how I got to know J. He worked for Gary. He lived in Orlando, where Gary did at the time. He does it now.

01:10:40
uberrick: Hey Adam! It's been a while. How are things?

01:10:48
<transcript>: Jay and I got to work together for five years or so before I start satin Use. Jay was one of our first hires at Statmes. J, you know, is a moderator here on this twitch, although I haven't seen him since I returned.

01:10:48
<transcript>: he probably

01:10:50
<transcript>: He probably doesn't even know I'm still streaming.

01:10:50
<transcript>: so jay is

01:10:51
<transcript>: So Jay is a good friend.

01:10:51
<transcript>: and that

01:10:53
thdxr: I also went through the doubling salary experience - it's a lot more possible when you're a consultant

01:11:00
<transcript>: And that was all because of Gary, so, yeah, I still do stay in touch with Gary every, like year or so. I'll email him and say, how's it going? Gary.

01:11:00
<transcript>: let's

01:11:02
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:11:06
thdxr: because your rates can go up rapidly if you generate enough opportunities

01:11:10
<transcript>: And I'm just gonna scroll now I'll put people sit on mes and balls. It's fine. Yeah, I'm not copying prime. I know I can't be Prime.

01:11:10
<transcript>: totally

01:11:21
<transcript>: Totally missed the chair. Mom worked at kindergarten. I started to make more than her when I was eighteen. In my first software jeb dev job, I kind of felt bad to say how much I make to her. Yeah.

01:11:21
<transcript>: yeah

01:11:22
thdxr: then reach a point where it's not worth going up anymore and you try to figure out how to do less work

01:11:27
<transcript>: Yeah. I look at my parents like just how much work they had to do. For how.

01:11:27
<transcript>: little

01:11:41
<transcript>: Little compensation. And it's easy to be very grateful, I guess, for your job in Tech when you kind of know that world. And just like a lot of people in my area and the ozarks, it's very few people work in tech.

01:11:41
<transcript>: so

01:11:49
<transcript>: So get a lot of questions from neighbors and stuff like, what do you do? Tell me more. I would like to do it as well. Oh, it's a lot. Thanks so much for the follow.

01:11:51
glamshatterskull: are the avatars on stat muse generated? (huge nba fan here... rockets for life)

01:12:00
<transcript>: Australian Dollars, but, yeah. Did you use a stabilizer ring with the ball when you used it? No. What is the stabilizer ring? I just sat on a ball.

01:12:07
<transcript>: You're a winner. And I like that. Thank you so much, jiga Man. I appreciate that. Follow.

01:12:15
<transcript>: Let's see. So many people skimp on a decent keyboard. I love keyboards. I got super in the keyboards. Probably two in the keyboards.

01:12:15
salkinvonbach: I miss working in tech. I now work in media

01:12:20
<transcript>: I'm sorry that it keeps autozooming in on me.

01:12:20
<transcript>: the algorithm

01:12:25
<transcript>: The algorithm is not very good. The model is not very good knowing what is an extreme face.

01:12:31
<transcript>: Like if I block my face at all, it thinks I'm making some giant expression, I guess.

01:12:35
mhuggins7278: I recently got a moonlander...loving it so far

01:12:36
laytanl_: @GlamShatterskull He has a fulltime animator

01:12:37
cowfacedude99: @GlamShatterskull I think they pay someone.

01:12:38
<transcript>: Info Slough Hey, Instafuff, I haven't seen you know why I still use an ironing board as a standing desk. That is awesome. Now, that is a good story.

01:12:38
<transcript>: and when i

01:12:39
aaaaliou: You said you only have Mode keyboards, are you getting the Envoy?

01:12:39
salkinvonbach: Get some of my keyboards. I have way too many

01:12:47
grasp5533: @thdxr I'm trying to get started as a serverless consultant, but it's overwhelming figuring out everything out.  Currently trying to get website up, and land the initial clients

01:12:48
<transcript>: And when I said I haven't seen you in a while, I haven't streamed in a while, so I'm not like shaming you for not being in my twitch chat. I literally started streaming again this week after months off.

01:12:48
<transcript>: you

01:12:52
<transcript>: You also lose a lot of money in deck. Explain Nicholas.

01:13:02
marcusbuer: I like the autozoom

01:13:04
<transcript>: How are you doubleing salary every year? That's a great question, vapor. If I were a thinker, I feel like I would have put together why it is. I've made a lot of money in my career and I don't say that like Flipantly. I genuinely think.

01:13:04
<transcript>: there's something

01:13:08
<transcript>: There's something there's something about what I'm doing.

01:13:08
<transcript>: that's effective

01:13:09
<transcript>: That's effective.

01:13:09
<transcript>: because i

01:13:12
instafluff: yaaa it's great to see you on!!

01:13:18
<transcript>: Because I've made a lot of money in Tech in a lot of different ways. So I think there's something I've figured out I'm good at making money.

01:13:18
<transcript>: i don't but i

01:13:21
<transcript>: I don't but I don't know how I don't know why I don't know the formula.

01:13:21
<transcript>: i think

01:13:29
<transcript>: I think I think if I'm being honest I think something about where I grew up here in the Ozarks.

01:13:29
<transcript>: i think like

01:13:35
<transcript>: I think like I've had to interact with people. I wasn't into tech all growing up. Loukie, thank you so much.

01:13:39
<transcript>: I think like I am pretty good.

01:13:39
<transcript>: on the

01:13:42
<transcript>: On the phone with people.

01:13:47
<transcript>: So that's my best guess is I think I'm pretty good. I come off pretty well.

01:13:47
<transcript>: in

01:14:03
jiggaman98: You‚Äôre blessed.

01:14:07
jiggaman98: You‚Äôre very charismatic.

01:14:08
<transcript>: In, like a sales situation where I'm doing freelance work and I'm gonna sell you my services. I think I get off phone calls and people feel very confident that they can trust well, and on the other side of it, they trust that I'm gonna deliver it. And I always do delivers. So that's one thing I would say if I if I have a secret to my career and why I think I've.

01:14:08
<transcript>: done really well

01:14:09
<transcript>: Done really well.

01:14:09
<transcript>: in terms of

01:14:12
<transcript>: In terms of finances, it's that.

01:14:12
<transcript>: i

01:14:17
<transcript>: I refuse. Like refused to not deliver. So if there's something.

01:14:17
<transcript>: that i've

01:14:21
<transcript>: That I've said, I'm gonna do I think I'm getting emotional.

01:14:24
salkinvonbach: Oh yeah that's charisma. I have zero of that

01:14:31
iamprozod: you look trustworthy and kind, so thats definitely a plus

01:14:32
marcusbuer: @SalkinvonBach same

01:14:35
<transcript>: If there's something I said, I'm gonna do, I'm going to do it, and I'm gonna do it well. And that's probably a lot of it, like, repeat work when people come back and they want me to do more stuff, they know, like, I'm gonna deliver. So I think.

01:14:35
<transcript>: that's part

01:14:41
<transcript>: That's part of it. It's like I come off very confident on a phone call with somebody.

01:14:41
<transcript>: and then i

01:14:55
<transcript>: and then i say i'm gonna do something and then i do it and i do it well or i overdeliver and then they pay me more than next time i think that's the long and short of it if i were gonna figure out the formula for how i doubled my salary several years in a row

01:15:02
cazcik: did having kids/family change it a lot for you? i.e. when did the salary doubling start happening

01:15:03
<transcript>: Set. Three hundred fifty nine dollars on my current laptop. It works fine. I have a real desktop, though.

01:15:03
<transcript>: yeah i can't

01:15:04
<transcript>: Yeah, I can't work on laptops.

01:15:21
<transcript>: i also

01:15:41
<transcript>: i also went through the doubling salary experience it's a lot more possible when you're a consultant yes that's the other thing i was not working like a w two job where i had performance reviews and they were like you know what you did great this year let's double that salary that was not the case i was independent i was doing freelance work five years in a row actually i started

01:15:41
<transcript>: a little

01:15:44
phdhorrible: I doubled my salary YOY every year until I got a job at 16 Kappa

01:15:46
<transcript>: A little agency. I had subcontractors, I think four or five at my peak.

01:15:46
<transcript>: that's

01:15:54
<transcript>: That's. That's basically how I was able to double. It wasn't just like I'm doubling my hourly rate. It was like leveraging.

01:15:54
<transcript>: my ability to

01:15:57
glamshatterskull: the NYC way is to 2-3 year job hop

01:15:59
<transcript>: My ability to get other people to do things with me and building a little team.

01:16:07
<transcript>: Because you're rates can go up rapidly if you generate enough opportunities. Yes, stacks. That's it. You've set that to me before it's about number of opportunities.

01:16:07
<transcript>: if you have

01:16:09
daglee: @adamdotdev Can I share something really embarrassing? So I applied for a job. Missed their email where I was offered the job, this was 2 moths ago.

01:16:10
salkinvonbach: People skills... also something I don't have

01:16:12
<transcript>: If you have a lot of different opportunities if there's 15 things I could do right now that people would pay me to do.

01:16:13
shiftlessatol: * misses that team *

01:16:20
instafluff: tbf freelance work has a very hard activation energy to critical client mass!

01:16:28
<transcript>: Someone's gonna pay me a lot to do their thing. Does that make sense, then reach a point where it's not worth going up anymore. And you try to figure out how to do less work. Yes, that too. So then eventually you figure out how can I make the same or more money.

01:16:28
<transcript>: and spend

01:16:31
<transcript>: And spend a lot less time doing it.

01:16:31
<transcript>: that is

01:16:34
<transcript>: That is that is the path.

<transcript>: I think I hit my Mac on keyboards from my wife's perspective.

01:17:39
<transcript>: not

01:17:42
<transcript>: Not necessarily from my perspective, but from my wife's first.

01:17:42
<transcript>: she does

01:17:44
<transcript>: She does set limits.

01:17:44
<transcript>: on

01:17:46
<transcript>: On my life.

01:17:46
<transcript>: in good ways

01:17:51

01:17:51
<transcript>: acquiring of things she's

01:17:55
amrleague0: how do i go from front end to a consultant who double his salary every year

01:17:57
<transcript>: Acquiring of things she's like a minimalist. She legitimately hates having things in our life.

01:17:59
<transcript>: So she doesn't love coming in my office.

01:18:07
<transcript>: She would have nothing if she could have nothing because stuff just stresses her out.

01:18:09

01:18:36
<transcript>: then

01:18:41
tymekdev: @SalkinvonBach Maybe it is the other way around? Get rid of keyboards to get a wife ü§î

How are you? I'm just catching up down to the I'm getting close to the bottom of chat. So I think you've probably tried saying something. I haven't gotten there yet. I'm so slow.

01:19:17
<transcript>: Making good on your promises. It's a good business. Right? That's right. Instafluff. Left. That's exactly right.

01:19:26
<transcript>: Kassik did having kids flash family change. It a lot for you. I. Ewinded. The salary doubling started happening. So my wife and I were married for six years before.

01:19:26
<transcript>: we

01:19:31
<transcript>: We had our now eight year old son, ASA.

01:19:31
<transcript>: so for those

01:19:41
<transcript>: So for those six years, it was just me and her. And that's when the doubling was happening. That's when I quit and started statmes right. When we had ASA.

01:19:49
<transcript>: So yeah. Most of, like, the hard work of my career was those first six years when we were just newlyweds and didn't have kids. Life was easy back then.

01:19:50
lukeyfam15: I'm doing fine

01:19:55

01:21:10
exegeteio: Heyo, @adamdotdev and chat.

01:21:14
<transcript>: Just in life in any career. Probably not just tech.

01:21:14
<transcript>: but i

01:21:17
<transcript>: But I do think in Tech, I think.

01:21:17
<transcript>: it stands out

01:21:23
glamshatterskull: people skills in tech are definitely coveted

01:21:27
daglee: I haven't tried yet. I might today. Or I just cry into a pillow.

01:21:34
<transcript>: It stands out. I've been told. So I'm not just trying to like, make up stuff. I don't have thoughts. Remember I have been told that my people skills sometimes stand out. When clients we're looking for someone technical to do technical work. They work getting a lot of.

01:21:43
exegeteio: The 2-3 year hop being the norm, is why I think I got a great job after staying at the same company for 18 years.

01:21:44
<transcript>: People skills on their prior calls. So they chose me because they felt comfortable talking with me. So I think I am good at talking with people.

01:21:44
<transcript>: pbd if

01:21:49
salkinvonbach: Ye lots of autists and creeps in tech

01:21:50

01:22:01
<transcript>: i think we

<transcript>: I think we've covered most of it.

01:22:03
<transcript>: so if

01:22:11
<transcript>: So if you missed it, you can watch the vibe? But I'm gonna go into my closet? We'll look at the dirty side of my office? We're all the junk is.

01:22:15
<transcript>: And I'll show you my chair and some stuff like that.

01:22:25
<transcript>: To be fair, freelance work has a very hard activation energy to critical client math. Whoa, that's a hard sentence for me. Freelance work.

01:22:25
<transcript>: okay

01:22:35
sockthedev: not a fan of the implied associated in phrase "autists and creeps".

01:22:42
<transcript>: Okay. Has a very hard activation energy to critical client mass. Oh, so a lot of work up front to get to the critical client math. Yes, insta. But that's true. But also, once you get there, it's very lucrative. Once you have enough clients.

01:22:53
<transcript>: You just you've got options and you don't have to do work. You don't want to do for rates. You don't want to do it at like you just you're able to have all the leverage. Once you have the leverage, you make a lot of money.

01:22:55
sockthedev: i'm autistic btw, and don't consider myself a creep

01:22:59
<transcript>: That's just my experience. At least frag. Why are you no longer running the mini agency? Oh, I quit that.

01:22:59
<transcript>: ten years ago

01:23:12
<transcript>: Ten years ago. I mean, that was it was not the most enjoyable work I've done in my career. From being honest, I don't love managing people. I really love doing things with my hands. I love building things. I love working.

01:23:12
<transcript>: focus

01:23:14
<transcript>: Focusing and typing stuff.

01:23:17
<transcript>: I don't love.

01:23:17
<transcript>: ironically

01:23:22
<transcript>: Ironically, I just talked about my people feels I don't love managing people. I just don't.

01:23:22
<transcript>: i love

01:23:26
tymekdev: The jump seems hard to make. I cannot yolo quit job because I have a family to support, but then I don't have much time to get my own things going...

01:23:29
<transcript>: I love working with really talented people. Ooh the Zoom in was dramatic there. I love working with.

01:23:29
<transcript>: people who

01:23:34
<transcript>: People who are really good at what they do and I don't have to manage them and just working like peers doing stuff together.

01:23:34
<transcript>: that's fun

01:23:36
glamshatterskull: being a boss sucks :D

01:23:38
<transcript>: That's fun. I love. I get a lot of energy from that I don't love, like.

01:23:38
<transcript>: you are

01:23:43
<transcript>: You are my subordinates. Do my bidding. I don't love that.

01:23:46
<transcript>: Let's see. I love rebuilding.

01:23:46
<transcript>: phases

01:23:50
<transcript>: Phases also love our scrappy youngins we just need a coach oh, you're talking.

01:23:53
<transcript>: You talking about the Rockets? I.

01:23:53

01:23:58
<transcript>: you're rocket

01:24:01
<transcript>: You're rocket sand. I'm like.

01:24:20
<transcript>: So how your time at your fan family? You love rebuilding phases, making like a home. Also, love our scrappy young insec. I love my kids, too. We just need a coach. And that's when I got very confused. You're tanking for women. Now there's a player. He's gonna be something in me. I don't know anything like that. It's like they just had the NFL combine.

01:24:35
<transcript>: Athletes just keep getting more nuts. They just keep getting, like, bigger, faster, stronger, more skilled. It's insane. Like all the knowledge or something that's growing. But Weimbi's just a freak of nature. I mean, that's just insane how big he is and how skilled.

<transcript>: Lived in New York City for ten years, was pretty much independent the whole time.

<transcript>: i didn't

01:24:52
<transcript>: I didn't overthrow or try to overthrow him. We talked to Walshock and said, what if we can give you AI tools that allowed you.

01:24:52
<transcript>: to

01:24:54
<transcript>: To move faster.

01:24:54

<transcript>: Just a faster bicycle, you know, for the mind.

01:24:57
<transcript>: welcome

01:25:05
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat amr League. How do I go from front end to a consultant who double his salary every year? I don't think there's like a formula. I do think.

01:25:16
<transcript>: Some principles probably apply. I think everything I've set so far is probably all I know again. I don't really have thoughts. I don't have a lot of thoughts. I'm a man of action.

01:25:16
<transcript>: i don't know i've never

01:25:19
daglee: It always starts with a faster horse!

01:25:22
<transcript>: I don't know. I've never said that before, but it sounds. It sounds good. I'm a man of action. I don't think I do.

01:25:28
<transcript>: And the autozoom.

01:25:28
<transcript>: out of zoom is done

01:25:29
<transcript>: Out of Zoom is done.

01:25:43
<transcript>: I did an independent run there during my tenure. It was fun. I need to get a Y so I can get rid of my hundred keyboards. Exactly. Welcome to Chat OS a lot. Can you break down the board you're using right now? Oh, like break it physically. Break it down.

01:25:45
<transcript>: Or you just mean like.

01:25:45
<transcript>: talk about it

01:25:46
<transcript>: Talk about it.

01:25:49
<transcript>: So let's talk about it.

01:25:49
<transcript>: i hope this is what

01:25:53
<transcript>: I hope this is what you meant. This is a motion.

01:25:53
<transcript>: with

01:26:01
<transcript>: With gmk dracula keycaps. It's the Gray mode. Eighty. I have a copper plate.

01:26:01
<transcript>: so the plate

01:26:08
<transcript>: So the plate, like when you smack the keys, they hit the plate. The plate on this one is the copper plate.

01:26:08
<transcript>: i have a

01:26:13
<transcript>: I have a silver back with lots of fingerprints on it because I just touched it. Okay.

01:26:18
<transcript>: So I put silver back on, like all of mine, because I just think it's so cool. Look at that. You can see my reflection.

01:26:25
<transcript>: Yeah, this is the mode 80 trying to think what else? So I mentioned it's. The mode.

01:26:27
<transcript>: Signal. Switches. The tactile switches.

01:26:30
<transcript>: What else.

01:26:30
<transcript>: i didn't

01:26:33
<transcript>: I didn't do the foam.

01:26:33
physotronic: is that keyboard or self defense weapon? Kappa

01:26:35
<transcript>: Insert or whatever.

01:26:41
<transcript>: Any other questions? Is that everything about a keyboard I don't even know.

01:26:44
starrk2k: I am back to freelancing after working as a manager for 5 years for the same reason, I'm not particularly eager to manage other people. I like to code and build Web Stuff.  Do you have a suggestion for landing a freelance job in the US, coming from EU (Germany)

01:26:46
<transcript>: Things with the Fallout, Fresh gigi and massoo.

01:26:54
salkinvonbach: Why would you make a switchplate out of copper

01:26:56
<transcript>: Maybe it's the other way around. Get rid of keyboards to get a wife. There you go. What do you mean? I was in a different browser tab, and I switched over here because I thought I heard Tony Robbins. Tony Robbins.

01:26:56
<transcript>: did

01:27:10
<transcript>: Did my voice sound like Tony robbins Stobi thanks so much. That follows. Doby oh, we are getting so close to 30 followers and whenever I hit a thousand milestone, I throw a party. Unless you were here for the 1000, the 2000 parties. People got stuff.

01:27:10
<transcript>: i gave things

01:27:12
<transcript>: I gave things away.

01:27:21
fragaverage: whats for the 3k party?

01:27:23
<transcript>: So I'll probably do that again. Oh, look at this. That just picked it up. People are like following me now. Tough top topic. Thank you so much for that. Follow.

01:27:25
<transcript>: following live

01:27:28
salkinvonbach: @sockthedev sorry I'm both but I didn't mean to equate the two

01:27:32
<transcript>: Following livemas? How far behind on Chad? Am I OOH too far too much wise words I'm gonna read fast.

01:27:33
aaaaliou: Would you do a tour of your tools? e.g. editor, browser, what you use for notes, etc

01:27:51
sockthedev: @SalkinvonBach üíú

01:27:57
<transcript>: trapped at a big company so working hard at the beginning of your career i do think there's a pattern there i think a lot of people that have done that have had success with it levi dane thank you so much for that follow i know it's controversial to say you should have to work hard because twitter's like no you shouldn't worry about

01:27:57
<transcript>: i don't know

01:28:01
<transcript>: I don't know why that's controversial. There's a lot of things I don't understand.

01:28:08
<transcript>: And it's like the same like set of beliefs. And I do this too. Like we.

01:28:08
<transcript>: we

01:28:28
<transcript>: We identify with one belief, and it's like, that comes with 15 others. It's like, oh, you signed up to be in this camp. So now this is what we think. I feel like that's how people are. I don't know why so many people don't don't, like, maybe it's the hustle culture thing. I don't like the hustle culture thing. And when I'm, like, kind of turned off when I see it. So maybe it's just, like, repelling against that.

01:28:28
<transcript>: and like if you're talking

01:28:32
<transcript>: And like if you're talking about working hard, you're probably in the hustle culture and.

01:28:37
stobie: You just summed up Right and Left politics in a single statement about beliefs

01:28:38
<transcript>: There is just a lot of benefits to working hard, especially when you can before you have a family. It's a lot easier.

01:28:42
diogenic: Work hard but not in isolation. You'll learn so much faster if you have a network of peers

01:28:42
<transcript>: I want to make extra dough, but I'm at a startup using a side project.

oleksii_lisovyi: W E  NEED MORE BUZZ WORDS! ;)

01:29:02
<transcript>: Move. Go away. What is that? Pin. This message. I don't want to pin. I just want to read it. There we go. Using a side project to maybe get another gig or contract. Moonlight. I want the gold. Give me the gold. Yeah. Just find all the opportunities you can. The more opportunities, the more you'll make.

01:29:06
<transcript>: Exit exegital. Thank you.

01:29:06
<transcript>: for

01:29:17
<transcript>: For welcome to my chat, not thank you. Welcome. I say different things depending on what happens. And if you join chat for the first time, I say, Well, welcome to my chat. If you follow me, I say thank you for the follow.

01:29:18
glamshatterskull: i also am not a fan of hustle culture or those who promote it. it gives weird energy.

exegeteio: "exe" is fine.  nikaHi

01:29:23
<transcript>: Monkey see? Monkey do? Hey oh, atom? Devonchat hey oh? Exigit. Exigit.

01:29:31
<transcript>: Skills in tech are definitely coveted. Haven't tried yet. I'm in. Am I today? Or I might just cry into a pillow.

01:29:31
<transcript>: tag

01:29:33
<transcript>: Tagley. So you just discovered the email.

01:29:33
<transcript>: that sucks

01:29:37
dingusdev: What about both?

01:29:45
<transcript>: That sucks. Twitch is fun because it's like you're having seven conversations, but like a different timelines and asynchronously and very slowly. Dingus thanks so much for that. Follow.

01:29:45
<transcript>: let's see

01:29:48
swatee_: hi, really good to see you stream again HeyGuys

01:29:54
<transcript>: Let's see. Two, three. Are hot being Norm. Why do I have to read every message? Why do I have to? Is why I think I got a great job after saying coming for 18 years. Okay.

01:30:01
<transcript>: Two to three year hot being the norm. Yeah. I think people who do bounce around a lot, probably.

01:30:01
<transcript>: it works

01:30:04
glamshatterskull: TLDR; that you have to be killing yourself in your work all the time in order to get ahead @PhysoTronic

01:30:06
<transcript>: It works out for them, especially in the good markets. Like we just came out of a really good market for dead.

01:30:08
<transcript>: Thank you for that. Follow.

01:30:10
salkinvonbach: I feel like I need to hustle because I want to provide for future family

01:30:14
<transcript>: Lots of autists and creeps in tech. What was that about.

01:30:23
<transcript>: I don't remember what I said. That got that response. Nicholas, I'm good now. Or a good thanks. How's the new nanny going? Oh, man, having a nanny.

01:30:26
<transcript>: Is the best.

01:30:26
<transcript>: it's

01:30:32
<transcript>: It's why I'm able to stream again, really like now that we have an anti, I have more bandwidth. I'm able to work a little more and streaming.

01:30:32
<transcript>: is

01:30:36
<transcript>: Is just naturally fits into my new schedule.

01:30:36
<transcript>: the only thing

01:30:37
denvermullets: I'm trying to find a spot where I can level up to senior or something. Sitting at an agency but not loving it

01:30:40
klewless23: What are your thoughts on the future of education meow that all this new technology is here? What skillz do you feel like are gonna be super important moving forward?

01:30:43
physotronic: GlamShatterskull sounds something that you will hear from bad boss Kappa thanks for explanation

01:30:44
<transcript>: The only thing that sucks. Perla is great. So it's Perla. She's in the room right next to my office. And she's fantastic. She's one of my wife's best friends.

01:30:44
<transcript>: so that

01:30:50
<transcript>: So that was great. My kids already knew her and loved her. It was. Everything was great about it. It was just a perfect situation.

01:30:55
thdxr: is it weird employing a friend in that way

01:31:11
<transcript>: Billy sucks. Is she uses there's a bathroom down here, right next to my office. And that's her bathroom now. And I want it to be her bathroom. I don't want her to feel like she's sharing a bathroom with me. So when I have to pee, which is, as you all know, like every forty five minutes, I have to run upstairs all the way on the other side of the house. It takes me like a while. And then I'm like hanging out with my family in between, because they see me.

01:31:11
<transcript>: and i'm

01:31:14
glamshatterskull: @diogenic huge agree with this. immersing yourself in a community is not just good for learning but also social skills and future job opportunities

01:31:15
<transcript>: And I'm not in my cave anyway, that was way more than you asked for.

01:31:15
<transcript>: not a fan

01:31:17
<transcript>: Not a fan of the implied, associated and phrase.

01:31:17
<transcript>: autist and cre

01:31:19
<transcript>: Autist and creeps.

01:31:22
<transcript>: Implied associated.

01:31:35
<transcript>: Sock I'm autistic, by the way and don't consider myself creep? Oh, oh, yeah? I don't think you maybe I don't know I'm not gonna speak for Nicholas. Nicholas, I'll let you respond as you wish. Thanks so much for follow drama.

01:31:35
<transcript>: but i

01:31:38
<transcript>: But I didn't read it sock as being like.

01:31:43
<transcript>: This are creeps. It's like two separate categories of people.

01:31:44
<transcript>: We think Why, I.

01:31:44
<transcript>: actually

01:31:50
glamshatterskull: nailed it üëÉ

01:31:51
<transcript>: Actually, I think a lot more people are autistic than they realize. And like my wife is undiagnosed.

01:31:51
<transcript>: but

01:31:51
denvermullets: Also, love seeing @glamshatterskull pop up!

01:31:52
<transcript>: But.

01:32:05
<transcript>: Yeah. I think like modern society might lend itself toward Autism, it might just be a better way to be in today's society. I don't know. I'm saying things I don't know anything about. I should stop.

01:32:09
salkinvonbach: You said your people skills are what stood out among your peers in tech

01:32:26
<transcript>: Because I don't have thoughts. The jump seems hard to make. I cannot yellow quit because I have a family support. Then I don't have much time to get my own things going. So timeic. That is a feeling I resonate with a lot. There have been various points in my career where I felt like I needed to make a transition. But it's so hard when you have a stable thing to make a transition. It's so hard to leave a thing, even.

01:32:26
<transcript>: if you

01:32:29
<transcript>: If you have other good opportunities, it can be really hard.

01:32:29
<transcript>: to step

01:32:34
<transcript>: To step out and do something different. I totally sympathize with that.

01:32:34
<transcript>: eventually

01:32:40
<transcript>: Eventually it worked out, and I figured out how to make that transition, but that doesn't make it easier for you. I'm sorry.

01:32:47
pogjar: statmuse rewrite?!

01:32:50
<transcript>: Being a boss sucks. It does suck. Is that how far behind I am? I said that stuff so long ago about bosses. Okay, I'm just gonna have to skip ahead. Ooh, it's gonna be so painful.

01:32:58
<transcript>: It always starts with a faster horse. Is that a keyboard shows I'm back and feeling over. And why would you make a sauce? Copper Turkey party.

01:33:01
glamshatterskull: @denvermullets i might get a mullet this week

01:33:01
<transcript>: Oh, three K. Let's go.

01:33:11
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat stobie. You just summed up right and left politics and a single statement about belief. Did I did I do it well, or did I do it terribly.

01:33:11
<transcript>: first

01:33:20
<transcript>: First time chat. Welcome to Chat Diogenic. Work hard, but not in isolation. You'll learn so much faster if you have a network of peers. Yeah. I think the Internet. I think that's.

01:33:20
<transcript>: a great call

01:33:23
<transcript>: A great call learn with other people.

01:33:35
<transcript>: Find people who are really interested in the thing if it's programming or whatever. You got lots of people to choose from that are very driven and excited about it online. Get plugged into those communities. Discord whatever Reddit.

01:33:35
<transcript>: just

01:33:38
klewless23: ‚ÄúNetwork of peers‚Äù lolz‚Ä¶ ya das da internet!

01:33:38
<transcript>: Just not not hacker news. Probably. I don't know.

01:33:46
<transcript>: What is Hustle culture? Hustle culture? I don't even know if I'm qualified to explain it, but I think it's the people who, like.

01:33:46
<transcript>: post stuff

01:33:52
<transcript>: Post stuff on LinkedIn. Maybe those are hustle calls. I don't know. Actually, I have no idea. Just people who are like.

01:34:05
<transcript>: Oh, man, I can't. I can't. I can't exaggerate without sounding just like talking about my own life. Like, look at whatever accomplished. Look at all this. It's because I work hard. That sounds exactly what I said on the stream.

01:34:10
<transcript>: I don't know how culture is a thing. Someone explain it. Please.

01:34:10
<transcript>: i

01:34:10
oleksii_lisovyi: LinkedIn hater detected KAPPA

01:34:14
<transcript>: I'm also not a fan of Huzzaculture or those who promote it. It gives weird energy.

01:34:19
<transcript>: I feel like I know it when I see it, you know, I know hustle culture when I see it.

01:34:22
zachrip: the worst engineers I know are the ones that silo themselves and don't collaborate (and sometimes they silo themselves because they're worried about not being perfect, it's cyclical)

01:34:23
<transcript>: First time chat. Welcome to Chat. Dingus. What about both.

01:34:24
jammontoast: LinkedIn sucks.

01:34:25
<transcript>: Oh.

01:34:25
<transcript>: what

01:34:28
<transcript>: What I'm so I'm so behind.

01:34:28
<transcript>: hi

01:34:39
<transcript>: Hi. Really good to see you. Stream again. It is really good to stream again. Swatty. Thank you so much, erie. Thank you for that. Follow. Guys, we are within 30 followers of 30.

01:34:39
<transcript>: and then

01:34:41
<transcript>: And then it's Party time.

01:34:48
mrkayteck: hustle culture is glorification of the idea, that instead of wasting time on hobbies or family you should build a side business or side "hustle" to get ahead

01:34:49
<transcript>: Tldr you have been killing yourself in your work all the time. In a head. Five, though. Oh, you're talking to five. Okay.

01:34:54
<transcript>: Welcome to chat.

01:34:54
<transcript>: clueless

01:35:04
<transcript>: Clueless. What are your thoughts on the future of education? Now that all this new technologies here what skills do you feel like are gonna be super important moving forward.

01:35:10
<transcript>: So the future of education, I think AI is gonna be involved and that both scares me and excites me.

01:35:10
<transcript>: what i

01:35:19
thdxr: the only skill that matters is problem solving, be good at that and you'll be fine

01:35:22
exegeteio: Important skills:  Learn how to learn.  nikaList

01:35:28
<transcript>: What I mean by that is like, I have had so many thoughts about building like an Ed tech startup that's, like, uses AI. I just think like, every student should have an ipad and a personal tutor, and that's hard to scale. We can't have one teacher, one to one ratio, right of students and children.

01:35:28
<transcript>: but

01:35:33
<transcript>: But like the internet makes it so easy to go out and learn stuff.

01:35:33
<transcript>: that's great

01:35:37
<transcript>: That's great. But that's more like when you're an adult for children. I think having, like.

01:35:37
<transcript>: a

01:35:49
<transcript>: A supervised experience, a learning experience, a guided experience. That's one to one fact that's a job AI could do probably reasonably well today. Now, there's concerns. Obviously. I'm not saying, like, just.

01:35:49
<transcript>: throw kids

01:35:55
oleksii_lisovyi: AI can make people more stupid, but not necessarily will.

01:36:10
<transcript>: throw kids on chat dpt and we're good to go because like i know it's confident and wrong a lot but i think like you could build an actual product that more guided and more like honed in where every kid has a device and they're like one to one with a teacher i think that should exist i say all that i wanted to build it like five years ago

01:36:10
<transcript>: news because we have all these

01:36:23
tymekdev: @exegeteio Took me 18 years of education and then realizing I can learn on my own and learning is actually a fun thing to do

01:36:23
<transcript>: News because we have all these athletes we were working with. We were recording them in the studio to answer sports questions with their voice. And the idea was like, we have all these illustrations. Let's make an animated lebron James, and kids will get to, like, learn talking with lebron James, like, learn math or whatever.

01:36:23
<transcript>: by using

01:36:29
<transcript>: By using sports statistic references. Like that idea. I think there's something there.

01:36:36
<transcript>: We were very excited about doing that. And then just like I had to focus on other stuff, but v seam thank you for that. Follow.

01:36:38
tragicjam: are the statmuse cartoons AI generated?!

01:36:41
<transcript>: So what skills do you think are gonna be super important? Moving forward.

01:36:41
<transcript>: i mean obviously

01:36:43
glamshatterskull: can we get hakeem olajuwon instead of lebron?

01:36:44
glamshatterskull: LUL

01:36:45
<transcript>: I mean obviously like being technologically savvy.

01:36:45
<transcript>: will serve you well

01:36:51
<transcript>: Will serve you well into today's society. I feel like that's the most obvious thing that I've ever come out of my lips.

01:36:54
<transcript>: But yeah, I think.

01:36:54
<transcript>: in terms of

01:37:01
<transcript>: In terms of skills, you can't go wrong just being really internet fluent and.

01:37:01
<transcript>: not even

01:37:04
<transcript>: Not even like I mean, like programming is obviously a great career.

01:37:11
<transcript>: If you enjoy it and you can set and focus for that one, I think half of it's like, can you set in a chair most of your day.

01:37:11
<transcript>: maybe

01:37:14
<transcript>: Maybe shouldn't maybe stand in desk? I don't know.

01:37:18
<transcript>: So that's a skill being able to just focus on something for a long time.

01:37:18
<transcript>: and solve problems

01:37:27
<transcript>: And solve problems. Those are skills. Okay, again. I don't have thoughts. I'm terrible at this. Glance at school. Sounds something you'll hear from.

01:37:30
<transcript>: I think you're trying to sell.

01:37:34
<transcript>: Is it weird employing a friend in that way.

01:37:44
<transcript>: That directed at me. Dax, I feel like at some point I just have to scroll. Just bite the bullet and just.

01:37:49
<transcript>: Sammy's? Rewrite? Yeah, we're? Rewriting status? Calm.

01:37:51
salkinvonbach: Learn C and the shell.

01:37:53
<transcript>: Status.

01:38:12
salkinvonbach: It's as basic as reading and writing

01:38:13
<transcript>: Hustle. Here we go, Mr. K. Welcome to Chat. Hustle culture is glorification of the idea that instead of wasting time on hobbies or family, you should build a side business or side hustle to get ahead. Oh, interesting. I didn't know. Is that specific. The only skill that matters is problem solving. Be good at that. And you'll be fine. I said to problem solving before I read DAX, say it DAX.

01:38:13
<transcript>: is smart

01:38:15
livemahs: You‚Äôre pretty close to the new chats, doing great üëçüèª

01:38:18
<transcript>: Is smart. Dax has thoughts. He said problem solving. I said it. I had a thought.

01:38:18
<transcript>: everybody

01:38:21
<transcript>: Everybody I'm a thinker I thought.

01:38:25
<transcript>: Important skills. Learn how to learn Yes.

01:38:25
<transcript>: so i

01:38:28
<transcript>: So I filled out a College after three semesters.

01:38:28
<transcript>: and i

01:38:31
<transcript>: And I don't know if I got anything out of College.

01:38:33
<transcript>: I mean, I got a curiosity.

01:38:33
<transcript>: it made me

01:38:37
glamshatterskull: how do you put problem solving on a resume? LUL

01:38:39
klewless23: Thank you! I work for a a MOOC currently, but have been wanting to build a stock exchange for skills for a while now - matching buyers of skills (employers) w sellers of skills (employees)

01:38:41
<transcript>: It made me curious about computer science. But mostly I got addicted to World warcraft. And that's mostly what I got from College. But after College.

01:38:41
<transcript>: i think

01:38:43
<transcript>: I think I learned how to learn.

01:38:43
<transcript>: and the internet

01:38:45
oleksii_lisovyi: @SalkinvonBach Please don't take C as a first programming language.  Better by Python or JS.

01:38:48
fragaverage: hell yeah WoW

01:38:57
<transcript>: And the Internet is a great friend in that setting. Like when you want to learn stuff, we have all the knowledge out there that's accessible. If you have access to the Internet, AI can make people more stupid, but not necessarily will.

01:39:01
<transcript>: That's true. I think.

01:39:05
zachrip: When are we rewriting statmuse

01:39:08
<transcript>: On a chat. Tragic jam. Are the stamis cartoons AI generated? Wow. Second time someone's asked that today.

01:39:08
<transcript>: there's actually

01:39:21
<transcript>: There's actually an illustrator named Michael Walshock, and he illustrates us. He's worked at Sam is for like seven years. They are not Aigenerated, though they might be in the future. We might just have wall chalk using style transfer. So there's like.

01:39:21
<transcript>: whip them out

01:39:26
<transcript>: Whip them out real fast. Can we get Hakeema lies on instead of lebron? Yes.

01:39:26
<transcript>: that's

01:39:28
<transcript>: That's awesome.

01:39:29
salkinvonbach: @oleksii_lisovyi it's a great first programming language

01:39:35
<transcript>: Learn C and the shell. It's as basic as reading running. You're pretty close to new chats. Doing great. Oh, I'm getting close. How do you put problem solving it on a resume.

01:39:41
<transcript>: That's a great point, actually, because everyone's gonna say that it's like, what are your most valuable skills.

01:39:43
thdxr: keep posting messages so adam can't get to the end

01:39:43
<transcript>: I.

01:39:43
<transcript>: 'm great

01:39:53
salkinvonbach: Makes you understand underlying mechanics

01:39:55
cowfacedude99: +1 @thdxr

01:39:58
<transcript>: 'm great problem solver and communicator. I work well with others, and they're like, what are your weaknesses? And like I try to hard. I care too much like that's. So cliche resume. I just hate resumes. I wish resumes didn't have to be a thing, but I know that's a very privileged thing to say.

01:40:02
salkinvonbach: Makes you a better dev

01:40:02
<transcript>: I work for a MOOC currently but have been wanting.

01:40:02
<transcript>: to it's been

01:40:06
caelic01: What are your weaknesses? "my calves"

01:40:08
laytanl_: you should add some kind of command to shoutout the statmuse animator

01:40:10
gerellt: @GlamShatterskull Show don't tell. A one liner that tells the results of a problem you solved shows that.

01:40:11
salkinvonbach: Python is basically just a glorified shell

01:40:11
<transcript>: To it's been that thing or I can't read it to build a sock exchange for skills. For why not matching buyers or skills with sellers or skills? Interesting. There's some of those marketplaces today.

01:40:11
<transcript>: that's like the up

01:40:12
tymekdev: @GlamShatterskull I did X by doing Y as indicated by Z. Don't make it generic, use a specific case that makes your point

01:40:23
<transcript>: That's like the upworks and Elances, right? Please don't take. No, I didn't mean that. Like you should do it. I meant like it's a proven market. You should build in that market. Build something better. Because those probably need to be disrupted.

01:40:24
jammontoast: @SalkinvonBach Stop with the hot takes LUL

01:40:24
<transcript>: Okay.

01:41:15
salkinvonbach: @jammontoast how is that a hot take? I'm confused

01:41:16
<transcript>: You should add some kind of command to shout out the statme's animator. Yes, we should laten.

01:41:16
<transcript>: show

01:41:19

zachrip: @thdxr the irrigator

01:41:39
<transcript>: I'm scrolling skipping you guys are going so you're doing this on purpose. I don't think we are getting anything done today. We are getting something done today. Oh glam. I am horrible at selling myself so many skills, but bad at showing them off. I think selling yourself is a big part of big part of career outcomes.

01:41:39
<transcript>: i do think so

01:41:40
<transcript>: I do think so.

01:41:40
<transcript>: i don't

01:41:45
<transcript>: I don't like selling myself. I for sure don't like it. I don't think.

01:41:45
<transcript>: you

01:41:50
glamshatterskull: it's not fun

01:41:54
glamshatterskull: i hate bragging

01:41:54
cowfacedude99: @lukeyfam15 the filters are dead.

01:41:59
<transcript>: You shop out there? Instigator. Definitely an Instagram. That is the word. The villain. Thank you, sock. Where are all the channelpoint rewards gone? Yeah, I got rid of them. Lookie, it's kind of a long story, but we're going with a simpler stream.

01:42:06
tam_da_human: @vapor__dev check out Justin Sung on YouTube. Great about learning how to learn.

01:42:08
<transcript>: You've been called an instigator your whole life, antagonizer. That was the also the word I was looking for. Yeah, chaos, monkey. That's where I started to go, but that just sounds mean.

01:42:08
<transcript>: how is that

01:42:10
<transcript>: How is that.

01:42:10
<transcript>: a hot take

01:42:11
<transcript>: A hot take I'm confused.

01:42:16
<transcript>: Do you think there's any common misconceptions about learning to learn.

01:42:16
<transcript>: i don't know

01:42:18
<transcript>: I don't know. I read a book.

01:42:25
<transcript>: How to Learn or something. I read some book by somebody who claimed to be like, really good at learning. I don't know if I got anything out of it.

01:42:33
<transcript>: I think just being curious helps if you really want to learn stuff. I think you'll figure out how to be effective at it.

01:42:42
<transcript>: Yeah. I hate breaking too glam. I think it's like. I think it's just figuring out how to toe that line of, like, selling yourself.

01:42:42
<transcript>: but

01:42:45
<transcript>: But not.

01:42:46
succatash: I ask a massive amount of questions

01:42:54
oleksii_lisovyi: I think learning for learning is kinda pointless

01:42:55
thdxr: I like bragging, I'm the BEST bragger, there's no better bragger

01:43:04
<transcript>: Just not doing it for the wrong reasons. I think if you're doing it for the right reasons that'll come across. So that reminds me, stat muse in, like, the first couple years when we raised our A. So Disney Letter A round, we raised ten million dollars. It's kind of a big moment for us. We were a couple of boys from the ozark. We had never had money.

01:43:04
<transcript>: this was just

01:43:06
<transcript>: This was just like we made it. We did it.

01:43:09
tymekdev: Train learning by learning stuff lol. Nothing will beat a good experience. Be it learning something or learning learning by learning something

01:43:11
<transcript>: We raised this A. And Forbes was gonna do an interview.

01:43:14
obsralem_gacie: it looks like cgi

01:43:16
oleksii_lisovyi: You should be motivated to achieve a thing, so can start learning for a reason

01:43:19
<transcript>: And they did an interview. There's an article. You can read it. But they interviewed me and elam my cofounder. And I realized on that call.

01:43:19
<transcript>: after

01:43:21
shiftlessatol: " ... It's not bragging of it's true " -Adam Elmore

01:43:25
<transcript>: After the fact, I did a terrible job of selling myself. And just like I had spent.

01:43:25
<transcript>: at that point

01:43:33
<transcript>: At that point, a year and a half working just crazy hours, just sacrificing so many things to like, get statmes off the ground.

01:43:33
<transcript>: just kill

01:43:38
<transcript>: Just killed myself for it. Like just really put everything aside and we made statmes happen.

01:43:38
<transcript>: and

01:43:43
salkinvonbach: Oh venture

01:43:59
<transcript>: And in that interview, I remember just, like, I think it was just trying to be, like, humble or something. And it was like, oh, I just I love just helping my team succeed. And like I basically said some really vanilla, bland stuff that did not like, I was waking up at 02:00 a.m.. Every day, like, I was literally waking up at 02:00 a.m.. And working like, 12 hours a day, doing just nuts. Oh, work to get what we had done.

01:43:59
<transcript>: accomplished

01:44:00
<transcript>: Accomplished.

01:44:00
<transcript>: and i think

01:44:09
<transcript>: And I think on the interview with the guy at Forbes, I'm just like, yeah, I just like to cheer on my team and set some dumb stuff like that. It was so like, not worth replacement.

01:44:09
<transcript>: didn't even get

01:44:15
glamshatterskull: so blase

01:44:15
cowfacedude99: btw, off the topic, but should we have a announcements channel on the discord?

01:44:16
glamshatterskull: LUL

01:44:19
<transcript>: Didn't even get mentioned in the article. I didn't deserve to be mentioned, but that's an example of where you just gotta sell yourself. I should have told him. Yeah, we got the 02:00 A.m. Every day and I'm nuts. You should write about it.

01:44:28
<transcript>: I probably would have been in Forbes, but nope, there's a lot of ideal in there nothing really about me. And that's not like I'm not upset about it. It wasn't anybody's fault, but mound.

01:44:33
austencam: Good morning, Adam! Hope you have a wonderful day. austen8WIP

01:44:39
physotronic: you should not look at that stuff like "selling yourself", you are saying what you did

01:44:41
<transcript>: Let's see. Did it? What? Welcome to Chat Tam dehuman. Check out Justin sung on YouTube. Great. About learning how to learn. Oh, that might be who it was Justin song. That's so familiar.

01:44:46
<transcript>: Suck attached. Welcome to Chat. I ask a massive amount of questions. That's a great way to learn.

01:44:46
<transcript>: i think

caelic01: learn how to learn to brag

01:45:05

<transcript>: What looks like CGI.

01:45:19
<transcript>: Alexky, you should be motivated to achieve a thing, so can start learning for a reason.

01:45:22
<transcript>: It's not bragging if it's true, Dave is here.

01:45:26
<transcript>: That's exactly right, Dave. It's not bragging. If it's true.

01:45:29
<transcript>: That's a that's a great point.

01:45:35
<transcript>: Did I really say that? Or did you? Did you just attribute that to me? I appreciate it.

01:45:35
klewless23: If u want to get comfortable selling yourself, go get a job as an SDR and do it for a year

01:45:38
<transcript>: Obsrillim thanks so much for the follow as well.

01:45:49
thdxr: it's illegal to sell yourself fyi

01:45:52
<transcript>: Off topic, but should we have an announcement channel on the discord? Yes. Calf face. You should make more channels in the discord. That's what I'm saying. Please make my discord good. Okay. Do you want to get back to the office tour? I kind of took a break because I was tired of holding the thing.

01:46:00
salkinvonbach: !discord

01:46:01
fossabot: Adam has a Discord server and he'd love to see you there: https://discord.gg/E92M2chd3e

01:46:08
<transcript>: Austin. Good morning. I am having a wonderful day. Thank you. I hope you are as well. You should not look at that stuff. Like selling yourself. You're saying what you did? Yeah, that's it. Saying what you did. Just say what you did and make sure it's interesting. Try and find an interesting angle on what you did.

01:46:08
<transcript>: it's just like

01:46:12
<transcript>: It's just like, YouTube. It's like, YouTube, right? You just have to, like, make it interesting.

01:46:12
<transcript>: captains

01:46:15
obsralem_gacie: your stream looks cgi with this shallow depth of field

01:46:16
<transcript>: Captains silky. Thank you for the follow.

01:46:18
exnihilo80: @thdxr only if you get caught

01:46:19
tam_da_human: @adamdotdev How would you assess what would be 'complex enough'  or 'cool enough' project for an aspiring dev, trying to break into the field? Reinventing Twitter seems to much. MOOC projects seem to little.  Thanks for the welcome :)

01:46:20
<transcript>: How to learn to brag.

01:46:21
<transcript>: That's funny.

01:46:23
austencam: @thdxr this guy knows. illegal in 47 states

01:46:29
<transcript>: The legal to sell yourself for what's right here. For your information.

01:46:29
<transcript>: your stream

01:46:38
<transcript>: Your stream looks cgi with the shallow depth of field. Yeah. Yeah. So we just did kind of went through my equipment stuff. We're doing an office tour. It's a Sony a Seven S, three.

01:46:38
<transcript>: a

01:46:53
stupac62: Lens

01:46:58
<transcript>: A lot of it's settings, a lot of honestly, a lot of what makes this picture so good. Like, people really comment on this a lot like, wow, the production quality is so good. A lot of it honestly is like, how far away you are from your background. Okay. What is in the background? Like, are there interesting things behind you to see if you got.

01:46:58
<transcript>: like stuff going

01:47:00
glamshatterskull: lenses

01:47:01
stupac62: focal length

01:47:01
<transcript>: Like stuff going on back there that's interesting and not cluttered.

01:47:01
<transcript>: that helps

01:47:09
marcusbuer: DOF

01:47:10
<transcript>: That helps. And then and then, yeah, just like a good focal length. Knowing how to work with your camera. Just basic exposure settings, aperture, all that stuff.

01:47:13
stupac62: Can't fix a f/5.6 with settings

01:47:19
glamshatterskull: all in the fstop

01:47:20
cowfacedude99: and you spend a lot on your equipment LUL

01:47:24
<transcript>: Yeah, and a good camera helps, obviously. But you could spend a lot less on a camera and still get a similar effect. And then lighting's obviously important. There's a lot of stuff to it, I guess.

01:47:33
tymekdev: I want to get started with content creation, but damn, I have literally no depth in my "studio". :-(

01:47:35
<transcript>: Okay, Tam the human. How would you assess what would be complex enough or cool enough project for an aspiring Dev trying to break into the field? Reinventing Twitter seems too much.

01:47:36
salkinvonbach: You can do this with an 80 euro eos-m

01:47:41
<transcript>: Mooc projects seem too little. What is Luke? I've seen that twice. Now. What is MOOC.

01:47:45
salkinvonbach: 100 dollars

01:47:47
<transcript>: Thanks for the welcome. I bet someone in my chat has a good answer to that. I do not.

01:47:48
glamshatterskull: @TymekDev use a green screen

01:47:51
klewless23: Massive open online learning

01:47:51
binajmen: Massive Open Online Courses

01:47:53
donpiruletto: moooooooooooc

01:47:54
<transcript>: Ideally, you find a project that you actually want to exist.

01:47:54
<transcript>: did i mention

01:47:58
cowfacedude99: @tam_da_human I'd say, build something and start growing it.

01:47:59
<transcript>: Did I mention Una, Una surveys? Thank you for that. Follow.

01:48:06
<transcript>: I think if you want to make that thing, if you want that thing to exist, you're gonna have a much better time building it'll be more like.

01:48:09
stupac62: I bet Adam is like me and suffers from GAS... Gear Acquisition Syndrome.

01:48:10
klewless23: Courses deeeeeeeb

01:48:22
<transcript>: You're focused on getting it done and figuring out solutions to your problems. If it's just like making a thing to put on a resume, I would struggle. I would not want to push through and figure out how to make it good because it's like this feels pointless. Pointless. No one's gonna use it.

01:48:27
cowfacedude99: things grow big as you work more with them. like our neovim configs LUL

01:48:28
<transcript>: All in the s stop.

01:48:41
<transcript>: I want to get started with content creation, but damn, I have literally no depth in my studio. This is only a twelve by twelve. Like this is a normal bedroom size room. I don't know. I guess I say only a twelve by twelve in the ozarks. That's a small bedroom.

01:48:41
<transcript>: in san francisco

01:48:44
<transcript>: In San Francisco. That's a giant house.

01:48:51
salkinvonbach: In the discord

01:48:56
glamshatterskull: in nyc that's an entire apartment

01:49:00
<transcript>: But it's like a it's a small, normal size room. I think just like getting enough depth and kind of like I do it at an angle so you can see, like the corner of the room is right there. Right. So like using the whole.

01:49:00
<transcript>: angle

01:49:07
<transcript>: Angle the whole triangle. What is that? Hypotenuse uses the whole, you know, I'm saying.

01:49:07
<transcript>: length

01:49:08
salkinvonbach: Exploiting that sqrt of 2

01:49:13
binajmen: diagonal?

01:49:19
<transcript>: Length? No. Whatever. If it were if you split the room into two triangles, you're using like the hypotnuse of the triangles. That's a bigger depth than like side to side. You know, I'm saying.

01:49:27
<transcript>: Okay, use a green screen. Oh, I didn't even show my green screen. Okay, let's get back to the office tour. I'll show you my green screen and some stuff like that.

01:49:39
obsralem_gacie: the most important thing is lighting i think

01:49:41
<transcript>: Mooc massive open online courses. Never heard of that. That sounds cool. I bet Adams like me and suffers from gas gear acquisition syndrome. Totally struggle from yes that I have that I have gas.

01:49:41
glamshatterskull: old pythagorean

01:49:50
<transcript>: Sounds funny. Things grow big as you work more with them. Like our neovim convict. Exactly. Okay, let's get back to.

01:49:55
<transcript>: The Office tour.

01:49:55
<transcript>: yeah

01:49:56
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:49:56
<transcript>: let me switch

01:49:59
glamshatterskull: pythagoras what a dude

01:49:59
<transcript>: Let me switch over to my.

01:49:59
<transcript>: oh

01:50:00
<transcript>: Oh.

01:50:11
<transcript>: It says, Be without my desk and my mic.

01:50:11
<transcript>: streaming

01:50:14
<transcript>: Streaming with you all I'm gonna turn on the big bright light again.

01:50:14
<transcript>: okay so here's

01:50:16
<transcript>: Okay. So here's my chair.

01:50:23
<transcript>: It's a core chair. My butt did not make that mold. It comes like that. Okay.

01:50:23
<transcript>: it comes

01:50:23
thdxr: that chair is so weird

01:50:25
<transcript>: It comes with the mold.

01:50:25
<transcript>: that

01:50:29
<transcript>: That is not because I waste so much. And I said in it so much.

01:50:29
<transcript>: so stop

01:50:31
<transcript>: So stop it.

01:50:31
thdxr: for adam's weird butt

01:50:33
mattmancodes: so you say

01:50:34
marcusbuer: it's backwards Kappa

01:50:35
glamshatterskull: so you can poop in there?

01:50:36
<transcript>: So that's my core chair feels like setting on a we get wobbles.

01:50:38
<transcript>: Like it moves around.

<transcript>: Can you see the.

01:51:20
<transcript>: Oh, I didn't turn on my my gimbals I got on.

01:51:26
glamshatterskull: ahhh i wanted to do a suspended green screen

01:51:28
schrew: THE HOOKS!

01:51:29
<transcript>: The gimbal was around. That's why I couldn't like actually look around with it.

01:51:29
<transcript>: okay so

01:51:32
<transcript>: Okay. So I had these little hooks on the ceiling.

01:51:32
<transcript>: and then

01:51:37
<transcript>: And then I hang green screens from the hook. So this is the green screen here.

01:51:41
<transcript>: That I can lock off my office view with.

01:51:43
<transcript>: And then.

01:51:43
<transcript>: i have

01:51:44
cowfacedude99: where's the larbar jar?

01:51:45
thdxr: do you need to light the green screen directly?

01:51:47
stupac62: @TymekDev It's possible with the right f-stop lens. You can probably get a 35mm f/1.4. Set it like 18 inches away and you can blur nicely. It's all in the f stop.

01:51:48
<transcript>: I have another one which is in the closet, which we're gonna go into now.

01:51:48
<transcript>: here we go

ismaelbranco: you use batteries for camera? or dummy battery?

01:52:20
<transcript>: With a Gray card clamp on the top, and I use it to set it in my spot, to dial in my camera, so I get my exposure right. It's like the 50 cent grape card or whatever.

01:52:24
<transcript>: I get my exposure right. And I get my wip balance right? What's that thing.

<transcript>: so much

01:52:53
<transcript>: So much.

01:52:58
tymekdev: @TymekDev Might be. I have literally a 80cm of desk depth and 60cm of space where I am to work with. I am going to experiment with it soon, but I think I will have to settle for frontal view and not an angled one

01:52:59
instafluff: YAAAS AWS! instafWaa

01:53:00
<transcript>: There's a whole bunch of junk.

01:53:03

<transcript>: it actually

01:53:32
binajmen: what is the brand of your keyboard?

01:53:34
<transcript>: It actually doesn't have that much equipment in it for me. So giant.

01:53:56
<transcript>: Which is helpful.

01:53:56
<transcript>: because

01:53:56
tymekdev: At least the one on the desk - Adam showed it some time ago

01:53:58
<transcript>: Because I.

01:54:05

<transcript>: It was the road.

01:59:11
<transcript>: it was really

01:59:13
<transcript>: It was really rough.

01:59:19
agemonkey: That rig looked expensive

01:59:20

01:59:22
<transcript>: Did I docks myself.

01:59:25

01:59:33
blakegreendev: you daxxed yourself

01:59:41
<transcript>: if you like streaming with hardwoods i thought about ripping up my carpet with the sound is so nice yeah so i think having the sound panels helps a lot when i first moved in and got everything set up in the office before i had the sound panels is sounded awful and the hardwoods are a big part of that there's a bunch of walls in hardwood

01:59:42
stupac62: I'm very surprised how good Adam's audio sounds with those floors

01:59:48
<transcript>: Nice rack and junk. Thank you, Uber. Rick. Appreciate that.

klewless23: Where did you get that sign behind you made?!

02:00:07
<transcript>: Aws instaf left. You saw that. Oh, welcome to Chat ismail. You use batteries for camera or dummy battery.

02:00:16
<transcript>: The the sonya Seven S, Three, and a Seven, four. You have to have the battery in the camera to run it. But they just plug in. They power through usbc.

02:00:18
<transcript>: So.

02:00:18
<transcript>: there's that

02:00:20
<transcript>: There's that.

02:00:21
snowfoundry: What about the desk?  Can you work 8 hours without standing?

02:00:22
uberrick: he's next to the casino in the ozarks xD

02:00:26
<transcript>: Oh, my face detection thing just triggered the.

02:00:26
<transcript>: where's

02:00:32

02:00:32
<transcript>: i eat

02:00:34
<transcript>: I eat too many of them.

02:00:34
<transcript>: but

02:00:38
<transcript>: But there is one on my desk right now, which I'm gonna eat here in a second.

02:00:39
<transcript>: Okay.

02:00:44
<transcript>: Show us the stream deck. Oh, how I use the stream deck.

02:00:46
<transcript>: Well.

02:00:49
stupac62: @adamdotdev the real question we have... what's the next GAS purchase?

02:00:50
<transcript>: There's like three buttons on it. I actually press now.

02:00:50
<transcript>: so we'll

02:01:00
<transcript>: So we'll one of the buttons I press is it turns on all my lights. So I do have them all plugged in. I've replaced all the outlets in this room with smart outlets so I can power everything up automatically.

02:01:02
<transcript>: I'll show you.

02:01:05
<transcript>: So I can hit.

02:01:05
<transcript>: button

02:01:06
<transcript>: Button.

02:01:16
<transcript>: It's on my stream deck. I guess if I hit that button, though, it's gonna turn off all my actual studio lights. Let's see if it works.

02:01:26
<transcript>: Might not be working. Actually, my stream deck might be broken. I mean, some of the buttons work, so here I can turn off all my practical lights. So on my background lights.

02:01:26
<transcript>: i can

02:01:28
<transcript>: I can turn off on my studio lights.

02:01:28
<transcript>: oh

02:01:30
<transcript>: Oh, where'd I go.

02:01:32
stupac62: are you using home assistant for the automation stuff?

02:01:37
<transcript>: And then here, oh, here you go. I'll just turn on my practicals so here's all my background lights only.

02:01:41
<transcript>: And my stupid.

02:01:43
<transcript>: Bookcase, lights.

02:01:43
<transcript>: don't

02:01:45
<transcript>: Don't come on automatically.

02:01:47
<transcript>: I mean crazy.

02:01:50
<transcript>: I'm not fixing hang on one SEC.

02:02:00
<transcript>: Okay. They do this stupid rgb thing when they first turn on. Okay, there's just my background lights. This is what it would look like if I didn't have studio lights.

02:02:00
<transcript>: and then

02:02:04
<transcript>: And then here's what? All my studio lights are so bright.

02:02:09
<transcript>: I dox myself. How did I DAX myself.

02:02:12
<transcript>: How did I do that.

02:02:20
<transcript>: Is that light big enough? It is quite big. I saw that tree on ozark. You're on your way.

02:02:24
<transcript>: Coordinates obtained. Sending nukes. That's too funny.

02:02:34
<transcript>: How does serious about nondoxing myself just looking at my window docks me.

02:02:41
tymekdev: There are some ways to lookup a view on Google Maps I think, so there's that

02:02:42
<transcript>: That rig looked expensive. You mean the camera, the walkaround thing I was walking around with.

02:02:43
<transcript>: It's, I guess.

02:02:43
<transcript>: i mean the camera

02:02:51
obsralem_gacie: i dont think so

02:02:53
schrew: I think it was more saying what forest you live in

02:02:53
<transcript>: I mean, the camera is the most expensive part. The rest of it's not as bad. Well, I guess the rest of it probably adds up total to be like what the catch is. Kdom, thank you for the follow. Eleven minutes ago. I'm so sorry.

02:02:53
<transcript>: i was

02:02:57
<transcript>: I was probably walking around talking into that stupid road. Mic.

02:02:58
developmentrobot: usually streamers don't do that, but you're good, no crazy stalkers I assume

02:03:01
<transcript>: micham's audio

02:03:01
<transcript>: micham's audio sounds

02:03:04
livemahs: Probably would if you lived in like NYC lol

02:03:11
<transcript>: Micham's audio sounds with those floors. Yeah. It was a lot of work. I mean, the part of it is the sound panels. The other part is there's a lot of junk in here now. So I got a lot of furniture that helps.

02:03:11
<transcript>: and then

02:03:11
gerellt: People are crazy good at stringing together small bits of information.

02:03:17
stupac62: @adamdotdev have you seen this guy that could easily find you  based on your backyard https://twitter.com/georainbolt/status/1630269575546966017

02:03:20
sockthedev: @developmentrobot speak for yourself

02:03:23
<transcript>: and then lastly i do a lot of realtime processing on my apollo twin x so that helps i think the raw audio without the plugins you want to hear what it sounds like without the plugins i'll do this here we go hang on

02:03:29
<transcript>: Here we go. I'm going to turn off all my plugins.

02:03:35
<transcript>: I just Pete, my family's, like, right outside my door, doing something. It's very loud.

02:03:39
salkinvonbach: I can hear the eq so extremely hard

02:03:39
stupac62: maybe a better example. https://twitter.com/georainbolt/status/1631337784182206464

02:03:39
<transcript>: Okay.

02:03:45
<transcript>: What do I sound like now? Oh, what do I? What do I sound like now you can't even hear me.

02:03:47
salkinvonbach: But I work in a studio

02:03:48
<transcript>: You can't even hear it without the plugins.

02:03:48
uberrick: quiet

02:03:49
klewless23: Far away

02:03:50
tiredbeaver: quiet

02:03:53
binajmen: better

02:03:54
binajmen: :D

02:03:57
tiredbeaver: @binajmen LUL

02:04:00
<transcript>: I don't think you can hear it without the plugin because they're all in a change, and they're set up in such a way.

02:04:00
<transcript>: that

02:04:01
<transcript>: That.

02:04:01
<transcript>: yeah

02:04:08
<transcript>: Yeah, I would have to change a lot of things, I think to make it actually sound like anything, so never mind. Can't hear what that's plugin.

02:04:09
grasp5533: the camera zoom was good there lol

02:04:15
<transcript>: Docs, we know he lives around 10 Rivers. That I say that.

02:04:18
<transcript>: Where did you get that sign behind you made.

02:04:18
<transcript>: custom neon

02:04:26
<transcript>: Custom neon something. I think the problem, the only knock I have on this sign and the reason I wouldn't maybe say Go with that manufacturer is.

02:04:26
<transcript>: it has to be on

02:04:28
<transcript>: It has to be on the brightest setting, or it's flickers.

02:04:28
<transcript>: at my frame rate

02:04:36
<transcript>: At my frame rate on my camera. So it's the brightest that it gets and I would maybe turn it down a bit if I could.

02:04:42
<transcript>: Can you work 8 hours without standing? I mean I have to get up and take breaks.

02:04:42
<transcript>: i

02:04:45
<transcript>: I can't just sit for 8 hours straight.

02:04:45
<transcript>: but

02:04:50
<transcript>: But I do just sit because I chose a desk that is aesthetically pleasing.

02:04:50
<transcript>: and it does not

02:04:52
<transcript>: And it does not let you stand.

02:04:58
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, the desk. It's an artifacts desk. I didn't mention that.

02:04:58
<transcript>: artifact

02:05:02
<transcript>: Artifacts, desk, CourtSHARE.

02:05:07
<transcript>: The credensas from like, Blue Dot. But like, I don't know, nobody cares.

02:05:07
<transcript>: i think

02:05:09
<transcript>: I think the.

02:05:14
<transcript>: Bookcase is from article maybe I don't know maybe Blue Dot. I don't know.

02:05:17
<transcript>: I'm next to the Casino in the Ozarks.

02:05:17
<transcript>: real

02:05:21
<transcript>: Real question we have what's the next gas purchase.

02:05:21
<transcript>: what is gas

02:05:23
<transcript>: What is gas.

02:05:33
<transcript>: Stock. What is gas? Are you using home assistant for the automation stuff? I use Casa outlets so all my smart outlets are Casa.

02:05:36
<transcript>: I don't know.

02:05:39
<transcript>: Do I use other stuff.

02:05:39
<transcript>: i don't think so

02:05:47
stupac62: GAS=gear acquisition syndrome. what's the next gear purchase?

02:05:53
<transcript>: I don't think so. I think that's all of my outlets are casa outlets and that's all I power off my stream deck for some reason. My if this then that automation is not working for my lights on my stream deck so I can't even use that. I just use the app on my phone or on my map.

02:06:04
stupac62: I'm going to make sure Adam remembers GAS.

02:06:11
<transcript>: There are some ways to look up a view on Google Maps. I think so. There's that I feel like I've put my address out there on the Internet. Far too many times. I'm pretty sure if you wanted to know where I was, you could find me. I hope nobody wants to know badly enough that they come find me unless you're friendly and then come hang out. That'd be fun.

02:06:19
<transcript>: I think it was more saying, what forest you live in. Oh, yeah. The Mark twain National Force is huge. It's like the entire midwest, so we're good.

02:06:19
<transcript>: usually

02:06:21
tiredbeaver: i've already triangulated his location

02:06:31
<transcript>: Usually streamers don't do that but you're good no crazy stalkers I assume thanks development robot. Just assume I wouldn't have any soccers, huh? What about me? Screams would not have stalkers.

02:06:33
tiredbeaver: based off of the reflection in his eyes

02:06:34
<transcript>: I'm just kidding.

02:06:38
<transcript>: Probably would if you lived in New York City. Yeah.

02:06:38
<transcript>: people are

02:06:42
<transcript>: People are crazy good at streaming together small bits of information.

02:06:42
<transcript>: soup

02:06:47
<transcript>: Soupak. Have you seen this guy that could easily find you based on your backyard.

02:06:47
<transcript>: what

02:06:48
mattmancodes: we just want larabars

02:06:50
<transcript>: What? Oh, geez, that's terrifying. Okay, I'm gonna click on it at some point.

02:06:57
salkinvonbach: Ye we work with celebrities

02:06:58
<transcript>: Sock. No. Speak for yourself on the soccer right. Sock is my stalker.

02:06:58
<transcript>: you can

02:07:04
salkinvonbach: And we have to be extremely careful

02:07:05
<transcript>: You can hear the eqs so extremely hard. Oh, what do you mean? You can hear the eq? So extremely hard.

02:07:08
<transcript>: Like it's too harsh.

02:07:14
<transcript>: Let's see you work in a studio.

02:07:14
<transcript>: oh

02:07:22
<transcript>: Oh, so you mean the EQ? Sounds bad. Nicholas, tell me more. I will have. I will hire you to fix my EQ.

02:07:30
<transcript>: Camera Zoom was good there. Hey, it did it. It worked. Gear Acquisition syndrome. What's the next gear first? Oh, yeah, I'm done with your purchases.

02:07:32
thdxr: someone fix my audio also

02:07:35
<transcript>: I am I'm very done with purchasing gear.

02:07:38
<transcript>: Yeah. Fix. Dax's Audio. He's on linux. Good luck.

02:07:44
salkinvonbach: Digital EQ is kinda flawed to begin with

02:07:46
<transcript>: I've already trangulated his location based on the reflection of his eyes. That's awesome.

02:07:50
thdxr: I'm building the linux competitor to adam's studio

02:07:53
<transcript>: We want Larabs. I want to larbar. Me, too. We work with celebrities. And we have to be extremely careful.

02:07:53
stupac62: @thdxr are you using pipewire?

02:07:55
salkinvonbach: Actually our systems master on linux too

02:07:56
thdxr: yes

02:07:57
<transcript>: Digital EQ is kind of flawed to begin with.

02:07:57
<transcript>: bummer

02:08:02
<transcript>: Bummer because that's what mine is. I'm building the linux competitor to M studio.

02:08:15
<transcript>: So, Nicholas, can you just tell me with my flawed digitally. Q.

02:08:15
stupac62: @thdxr have you tried this? https://kx.studio/Applications:Carla

02:08:17
<transcript>: What would you change.

02:08:17
<transcript>: is a little

02:08:17
salkinvonbach: But we use custom drivers

02:08:19
<transcript>: Is a little too muddy.

02:08:19
<transcript>: or probably

02:08:22
<transcript>: Or probably not. Probably a little too punchy at the top.

02:08:22
<transcript>: trying

02:08:26
<transcript>: Trying to use words like, I know what I'm talking about. I don't.

02:08:28
<transcript>: Custom drivers.

02:08:29
salkinvonbach: I hate those terms

02:08:29
stupac62: @thdxr GUI for setting up EQ and all that audio stuff

02:08:35
<transcript>: Probably start building statues.

02:08:35
<transcript>: i think i

02:08:37
thdxr: @stupac62 woah that looks cool

02:08:37
<transcript>: I think I did the whole audio or the whole officer, right.

02:08:41
thdxr: but I'm dumb

02:08:41
<transcript>: I really didn't have much to talk about.

02:08:43
<transcript>: I've.

02:08:45
thdxr: does it fix that

02:08:46
<transcript>: In here.

02:08:46
<transcript>: like what

02:08:47
salkinvonbach: They're for people that don't know what they're doing

02:08:48
<transcript>: Like, what do you say.

02:08:48
<transcript>: here's

02:08:49
<transcript>: Here's some cameras.

02:08:54
laytanl_: Sounds good to me ü§∑

<transcript>: They have lenses on them. And there's some lights.

02:09:00
gerellt: I mean did you show off your flooring?

02:09:01
<transcript>: There for people that don't know what they're doing.

02:09:07
<transcript>: Did you show up your floor.

02:09:08
glamshatterskull: this falls under selling yourself

02:09:09
<transcript>: I guess not.

02:09:09
gerellt: LUL

02:09:10
glamshatterskull: LUL

02:09:11
tiredbeaver: for some reason it is visually pleasant to watch adam chew on lara bars

02:09:15
<transcript>: This falls under selling yourself good call.

02:09:21
<transcript>: It's visually blasant to watch. Me too. I'm larvae's. I figured it was.

02:09:21
<transcript>: acoustically

02:09:22
stupac62: @thdxr I don't know your issue, but I use linux and have it. It works to adjust your audio. But again, not sure what your issue is.

02:09:23
<transcript>: Acoustically pleasant.

02:09:23
<transcript>: i know some people

02:09:26
<transcript>: I know some people like this. Oh, no.

02:09:28
salkinvonbach: Dammit I gotta go - can talk on the discord since I joined

02:09:31
<transcript>: It's okay. I got.

02:09:33
gerellt: PERFECT autozoom btw LOL

02:09:35
<transcript>: Nicholas.

<transcript>: Yeah, please do talk on the discord? Tell me how to fix my EQ.

02:09:39
<transcript>: i care

<transcript>: I care about the subway. Too much.

02:09:42
<transcript>: oh it

02:09:44
<transcript>: Oh, it did. It. Autozoom. That's awesome.

02:09:50
mattmancodes: camera zoom for the drama of lost choc chip

02:09:53
glamshatterskull: what mixer do you have?

02:09:54
<transcript>: It's the best. Dax can tell you that isn't the best. Or did you like one of the other flavors? Better.

02:09:56
tymekdev: @GerellT Yeah! And here is me having a hard time when my webcam goes out of focus

02:10:02
thdxr: yeah that one is the best have to order a whole box

02:10:09
<transcript>: What mixture do I have? It's a apollo Twin X. It's not really a mixer, but my audio interface where I do the mixing.

02:10:21
<transcript>: Is that one is the best one have to order a whole box. Yeah. So it begins. Dax.

02:10:24
<transcript>: I buy them by the box.

02:10:27
<transcript>: So it begins.

02:10:33
laytanl_: you got that sponsor yet?

02:10:33
thdxr: apparently the behringer audio interface is good too and maybe works on linux

02:10:36
austencam: I'm going to buy a box today. Pretty sure my wife lives on bars... so health

02:10:51
glamshatterskull: oh so do you use a digital sound router like voicemeter or loopback?

02:10:57
<transcript>: Oh late, and I haven't gotten a sponsorship yet.

02:10:57
<transcript>: marshall

02:11:01
stupac62: @thdxr I have a Presounus Studio24 that works on linux out of the box

02:11:02
<transcript>: Marshall should really pay me. I know people about Rs because of me.

02:11:09
<transcript>: So I didn't really say much but.

02:11:11
thdxr: wow amazon same day delivery with the larabar off amazon

<transcript>: You want to share any of that process.

02:11:39
bitwo1: Need to get an overemployed setup

02:11:42
<transcript>: Big fan of offices. I think more people should care more about their office.

02:11:42
thdxr: @stupac62 can you load plugins onto it so it does all the processing?

02:11:48
<transcript>: Are we going to work? Probably not covet, but we're gonna we're gonna consider it.

02:11:56
<transcript>: Need to get an ovloid set up.

02:12:02
stupac62: @thdxr Not the audio interface. That's where you'd use Carla

02:12:03
<transcript>: Okay. What was it in your state? You know what.

02:12:03
<transcript>: here's what we should do

02:12:04
<transcript>: Here's what we should do.

02:12:05
gerellt: I have trouble finding what to put behind me in my office. Which means I've got bare walls :(

02:12:07
tymekdev: That keyboard sounds üî•

02:12:09
<transcript>: We should.

02:12:11
bitwo1: If you work home office, your office is super impactful in your life

02:12:16
<transcript>: Set a goal. I need to get a certain thing done. Let's just say I'm gonna finish. I'm not doing anything else.

02:12:19
<transcript>: Until I finish this game page.

02:12:23
<transcript>: Finishing it, people. I'm gonna finish it.

02:12:23
<transcript>: watch

02:12:24
thdxr: I'm down to try Carla but I kinda like the processing done before it hits my computer so I don't have to think about it when I switch to windows and stuff

02:12:25
<transcript>: Watch me.

02:12:29
<transcript>: Finish the game page.

02:12:32
<transcript>: Let it here's what it should look like.

02:12:32
<transcript>: and

02:12:36
<transcript>: And here's with all the fake stuff that I just copy and pasted from the Dom.

02:12:41
siema_ja_wic: You look like somebody who smoke a little bit to much weed xd @adamdotdev

02:12:42
thdxr: right now have a janky virtual mic setup so I can use processing across all my apps

02:12:42
<transcript>: Okay.

02:12:50
<transcript>: So I think the first thing I made dynamic was this. So we built the real header, that's the actual header. See, it looks just like it. The verbiage changes.

02:12:50
<transcript>: just every time

02:12:51
stupac62: @thdxr I think you won't find any that do that that also support linux. Based on when I was looking

02:12:55
<transcript>: Just every time you ask a question. But basically, this is working, right.

02:13:00
<transcript>: How do I know who that player is? I'm so disconnected from sports.

02:13:02
<transcript>: Who is the.

02:13:10
<transcript>: James Worthy. Oh, is this an old game? This is an old game from 89. That's why I don't recognize them.

02:13:12
glamshatterskull: where do you get stats? basketball-reference?

02:13:14
laytanl_: Why are you rewriting it`/

02:13:16
<transcript>: What was that? Thank you for that. Follow stats and data.

02:13:16
<transcript>: i appreciate

02:13:17
<transcript>: I appreciate that.

02:13:21
<transcript>: Whoa.

02:13:21

<transcript>: what

02:13:28
<transcript>: What did I do.

02:13:32
<transcript>: I mean, I'm curious. What about me? Looks like that.

02:13:36
<transcript>: I'm not a smoker.

02:13:38
<transcript>: That tinchures.

02:13:42
<transcript>: I don't know. I don't do things in my lungs.

02:13:42
<transcript>: just i keep my

02:13:43
glamshatterskull: also what is "too much weed"?

02:13:44
<transcript>: Just I keep my lungs pure.

02:13:45
glamshatterskull: LUL

02:13:59
daglee: Weed? You mean l√§rabar!

02:14:01
<transcript>: I need to make all this real. And right now, this is the only part that's real. That Detroit pistons logo, that's it all this needs to be real as well. Let's do it.

02:14:02
marcusbuer: @stupac62 maybe if you use proxmox, inject the VSTs on the host's APO, then pass the audio to the VMs

02:14:05
<transcript>: Let's do it. So I made this r1 just like that.

02:14:05
<transcript>: i don't

02:14:09
<transcript>: I don't like the way I'm doing this. Like this.

02:14:09
<transcript>: assuming

02:14:12
<transcript>: Assuming the first item in that array.

02:14:13
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:14:13
<transcript>: i don't know

02:14:15
marcusbuer: not sure tho

02:14:15
<transcript>: I don't know. Is it.

02:14:21
<transcript>: Excuse me. Lar bar burps Dave.

02:14:21
<transcript>: visual

02:14:27
tiredbeaver: i can smell it too

02:14:28
<transcript>: Visual. Dot. D. Tails? Nope. What is it? Dot summer? No. What.

02:14:29
tiredbeaver: yummy

02:14:32
<transcript>: Data Dot visual.

02:14:34
<transcript>: Dot Where's the rest of it.

02:14:41
<transcript>: Okay. Did I not get the type finished up. Let's see.

02:14:43
mattmancodes: we've found the stalker

02:14:51
<transcript>: We started this yesterday, and I didn't finish it. Cool. Let's finish this.

02:14:59
<transcript>: Right now I have a janky virtual mic setup so I can use processing cross all my apps Linux problems am alright.

02:15:06
<transcript>: Where do you get stats? Basketball reference? No.

02:15:06
<transcript>: kind of

02:15:15
<transcript>: Kind of. So we hired Justin Capacco, creator of Basketball Reference. He worked at Sat mes for, like, five years, but we licensed all of his data in purpose.

02:15:19
<transcript>: It's the best sports database in the world.

02:15:24
glamshatterskull: agree

02:15:25
<transcript>: Why are we rewriting it great question latent. We're really writing Stamis.com. Because.

02:15:25
<transcript>: we're

02:15:27
<transcript>: We're building a whole bunch of new stuff.

02:15:27
<transcript>: we're gonna

02:15:45
<transcript>: We're gonna build like a membership model and a bunch of like, creator tools for researchers. The people who use statmes.com, we get like 2 million searches a day. And it's mostly sports, better journalists, fantasy players. We want to build tools for them and try and offer like a subscription to some percentage of those people.

02:15:45
<transcript>: to make it easy

02:15:54
<transcript>: To make it easy for them to do the research, but the existing codebase is like elixir and Phoenix mishmashed with like a real Act.

02:16:03
<transcript>: Spa embedded in parts of it. It's just really hard to work with, and it's hard to find people that know elixir, and we want to just.

02:16:09
<transcript>: Start over and say, what is that means today. It's a really good SEO.

02:16:09
<transcript>: magnet it

02:16:15
thdxr: I know elixir, look another reason for statmuse to hire me

02:16:17
<transcript>: Magnet. It has millions of pages that do really well on Google, and we should not have built it with React. It shouldn't be a spa. It's just dumb.

02:16:17
<transcript>: and it

02:16:27
<transcript>: And it makes it harder to do well on seo. We've done a lot of work to make it work like we prerender pages and store them. It's just all this nonsense. It's really painful.

02:16:37
statsndata: Wow

02:16:41
<transcript>: But when we built an eight years ago, when we started stamps, we didn't know what we were building. We thought it was a spa. It's like we didn't know any better. And today it's like now it'd really be better built differently, all server rendered and just more intelligent with the caching and stuff.

02:16:41
<transcript>: so that's basically

02:16:51
0xcouch: @adamdotdev do you also sell access to gamera/your own database?

02:16:51
glamshatterskull: yeah i will be honest i look at nba stats a lot and had never been to statmuse until today

02:16:51
<transcript>: So that's basically it it's like we want to be able to move faster. Just write typescript, have a more modern code base so that more people can help us. We might even open source the front end. We talked about that.

02:16:56
<transcript>: But then also.

02:16:56
<transcript>: just being

02:16:57
<transcript>: Just being able to.

02:16:58
glamshatterskull: was gonna ask about seo

02:17:01
<transcript>: Cater more to the use cases that we cater to.

02:17:01
<transcript>: we do a ton

02:17:04
<transcript>: We do a ton of Google traffic. We get I think we get.

02:17:04
<transcript>: i think like

02:17:08
laytanl_: rewrite makes sense yeah

02:17:15
<transcript>: I think like 5000 organic inbounds from Google everyday. So people searching sports questions on Google end up on statmes a lot and our pages should just be better for that use case than they are today.

02:17:18
statsndata: Did not expect to find a statmuse dev stream this morning

02:17:20
<transcript>: Okay. What is too much? We.

02:17:22
<transcript>: You mean laribar.

02:17:26
<transcript>: Not sure though I can spell it to yummy.

02:17:26
<transcript>: soccer

02:17:29
<transcript>: Soccer. You guys are funny. I know Elixir dax knows elixir.

02:17:29
<transcript>: another reason

02:17:32
tymekdev: Recently I heard "get the ssr die out finally"... I felt like that person stayed a bit behind

02:17:36
<transcript>: Another reason for statmes. I hire you. Listen, dax, you want to drive a status? I know you're joking. You got a job that's at me if you want.

02:17:36
<transcript>: it's just

02:17:38
<transcript>: It's just.

02:17:38
<transcript>: you're a little over

02:17:39
elicxlive: Honestly, I'm surprised that it hasn't already been rewritten after all those years üòÇ

02:17:40
<transcript>: You're a little overemployed at the moment, I think.

02:17:40
<transcript>: welcome

02:17:42
<transcript>: Welcome to chat, stats and data.

02:17:42
thdxr: will statmuse pay me too much

02:17:49
thdxr: I'll do _anything_ for money

02:17:51
dnbull: can i be the janitor at statmuse i clean well

02:17:54
<transcript>: Great question couch. Do we also sell access to gamerabase? No. But we've got building an API.

02:17:54
<transcript>: for

02:18:02
glamshatterskull: i will learn elixir to work at statmuse... need 48 hours

02:18:04
<transcript>: For a long time, there are definitely people who use that. Okay. So I say that we've built some one off apis for some strategic partners. We had a oneoff api for snapchat or snap.

02:18:11
daglee: Don't give me a job! I will just not answer! *slams head*

02:18:25
<transcript>: We had some kind of partnership with Snap where we were doing sports content. So we had an api for them. We have an api for some In Stadium apps. Teams use Statmes and their instate maps. Like, if you go to the staples center or whatever in Los Angeles, you're going to Lakers game. The In Stadium app would have like, you can ask questions. Statme's answers.

02:18:25
<transcript>: staff questions

02:18:26
<transcript>: Staff questions.

02:18:26
<transcript>: so we've done

02:18:39
<transcript>: So we've done some of that. Those are like one off apis we've built, but we've talked about doing, like, a consumer facing here's a Stammy's api, interact with it, build stuff with it. We've talked about it. I haven't done it, but definitely something we've considered.

02:18:49
glamshatterskull: so how long till you rewrite it in rust? CoolStoryBob

02:18:49
<transcript>: Gonna be asked about seo. Yeah. It's I mean, that's largely what drives our traffic. We do, like, 50 million page views a month on Statmeus. And it's mostly all because of Google.

02:18:53
<transcript>: Seo stuff inbound searches.

02:19:01
<transcript>: Did not expect to find a statme's Dev streaming this morning. Stats and data. I am a status Dev. I am I am Adam. I created Statmes eight years ago.

02:19:10
<transcript>: With my friend eli, and I took a threeyear hiatus. I was off for three years, and I just rejoined them in the last few months.

02:19:10
<transcript>: but

02:19:13
<transcript>: But yeah, I cofounded sat mews a long time ago.

02:19:23
gerellt: Is there an SEO hit if you rebuild in a different tech stack like this?

02:19:23
warre_p: @thdxr Are you like a freelancer with multiple customers or what does he mean by "overemployed"?

02:19:29
<transcript>: Recently I heard get the ssr die out. Finally, I felt like that person stayed a bit behind ssr die. Oh, like you. They wanted ssr to die out. Oh, did it. Did the ssr die out? Finally I got you.

02:19:41
<transcript>: Ssr is here to say. I mean, it's always been around those clientside stuff. I guess I'm surprised it hasn't already been rewritten after all those years. Yeah, it's kind of surprising. I mean, we've done a lot of work on it, but like, we haven't rewritten it in a long time.

02:19:41
<transcript>: six seven

02:19:42
binajmen: Astro is mostly a framework for content-based website, right? Offering new features for paying customers like the ones you just described probably means more user interactions (eg: interactive dashboard). I thought Astro was not a good fit for that. Are you going to use the Island architecture to tackle that?

02:19:44
<transcript>: Six, seven years. Something like that.

02:19:49
<transcript>: Will statmese pay you too much. I'll do anything for money.

02:19:53
<transcript>: I don't know about that. We're a small team.

02:20:01
<transcript>: Can I be the janitor at stat Music? Clean? Well, you guys are awesome. I will learn elixir to work at staff, news and 48 hours.

02:20:08
<transcript>: Okay. So how long till you rewrite it in rust. Bob Ross. That's good.

02:20:08
<transcript>: we're not gonna be ready

02:20:11
<transcript>: We're not gonna be ready and rest though I know you're joking.

02:20:12
maleero: Is everyone at StatMuse remote?

02:20:24
ittzsushi: D: No rust? Sadge

02:20:31
<transcript>: Is there an seo hit if you rebuild in a different tech stack like this, so hopefully not. Hopefully it'll be one to one. In fact, I'm gonna build a little harness to like hit thousands of our pages and compare like diff before and after with the old stack and the new and make sure that if the output's the same, there won't be an seo hit. No one will notice. In fact, if I do my job right.

02:20:45
<transcript>: We'll have rewritten this entire site in astro, and no one will even know we did anything. I'm gonna add dark mode like that's. It. We're gonna add dark mode while I'm doing the rewrite, but mostly hopefully you can't even tell anything changed, but we're able to now build all this new stuff.

02:20:45
<transcript>: in a much more mod

02:20:47
statsndata: Love Astro as the choice. Are you going to use the content collections?

02:20:58
<transcript>: In a much more modern stack. Not that luxury Phoenix aren't modern. A much more familiar stack as I make sense. Okay, I've missed some follows. Thanks so much for the follow. Bruno. Nazi gamer. You accept Codezilla.

02:20:58
<transcript>: greg

02:21:01
<transcript>: Gregor Rogen.

02:21:03

02:21:04
tymekdev: Ooh, Astro, lovely!

02:21:06
teej_dv: DID I MISS OFFICE TOUR??

02:21:07
<transcript>: Zach, Zackkle, that was like a follow spree.

02:21:07
<transcript>: cma

02:21:09
<transcript>: Cma.

02:21:09
<transcript>: stat the data

02:21:10
<transcript>: Stat the data.

02:21:10
<transcript>: whoo

02:21:12
tymekdev: @teej_dv Yep

02:21:14
<transcript>: Whoo that's a lot of follows. We are getting really close to 30 followers.

02:21:14
<transcript>: t

02:21:18
<transcript>: T'do you miss the office tour? No, not like this.

02:21:18
<transcript>: it'll be on the

02:21:24
<transcript>: It'll be on the VOD. You can watch the VOD or tea. Just come over. You can watch it. You can look at my office in person.

02:21:27
<transcript>: What did I miss here.

02:21:27
<transcript>: first

02:21:30
teej_dv: truueeee

02:21:34
<transcript>: First time chat. Welcome to Chat War. Are you like a freelancer with multiple customers? Or what does he mean by overemployed.

02:21:34
<transcript>: oh

02:21:36
<transcript>: Oh, you're trying to dax. So sorry.

02:21:45
<transcript>: Astro is mostly a framework for contentbased website right, offering new features for paying customers like the ones you described probably means more user interactions.

02:21:45
<transcript>: will interact

02:21:48
thdxr: @warre_p I just have a lot of projects going

02:21:48
statsndata: Any Tauri plans for an app in the future since you're on vite's builder with Astro?

02:21:53
<transcript>: Will interactive dashboard thought astro with not a good fit for that. Are you going to use the island architecture to tackle that? That's a great point. Maguin.

02:21:53
<transcript>: it's funny i just

02:22:04
thdxr: SST, Bumi, Rebase, podcast, etc

02:22:05
<transcript>: It's funny. I just said, What's that music today? Astro makes perfect sense. But the reason we're rewriting is to build all this new stuff. And you're right. It's a lot of new interactive stuff, like a dashboard and tools for creating content.

02:22:11
<transcript>: And yeah, the Islands architecture is the idea. I think solid will in up being what we use on the front end.

02:22:11
<transcript>: but

02:22:15
<transcript>: But I just haven't gotten that far. I'm still trying to rewrite the original stuff.

02:22:20
<transcript>: Yeah, great. Call out. Really great. Call out you looking for a job while we're just handing out status jobs.

02:22:23
<transcript>: Maliro is everyone that sent me remote.

02:22:23
<transcript>: yesish

02:22:32
<transcript>: Yesish. So we started out remote. In fact, my cofounder, who grew up with me here in the ozarks, lives in San Francisco. Well, lived in San Francisco. Not anymore.

02:22:32
<transcript>: i've been lived

02:22:35
warre_p: @thdxr Im quite new here, but I understood some of those things :P Interesting!

02:22:40
<transcript>: I've been lived there for, like, ten years. When we co found it. When we started samus, he was in San Francisco. I was in the ozarks. We built the company remotely.

02:22:44
<transcript>: And we hired remotely. So we hired people all over the country.

02:22:52
<transcript>: I guess all in the US, though we did hire so Kevin does our Instagram and like Twitter and stuff.

02:22:52
<transcript>: he's

02:23:02
<transcript>: He's responsible for a lot of the growth we've had on Twitter. He is from New Zealand, but he came over on an O one B visa. So we got him into the United States. He wanted to move the United States.

02:23:02
<transcript>: but otherwise

02:23:10
<transcript>: But otherwise I think everyone we fired has been in the US. I think like some of hiring Internationally was really hard, like having a nexus or something. I don't know.

02:23:11
codingdreams: isnt solid start on beta?

02:23:17
<transcript>: But everyone is remote. Yeah. Oh, I said, ish today there are like four engineers.

02:23:17
statsndata: Can I have a statmuse job if I can specialize in NBA?

02:23:27
thdxr: answering a bunch of solid-start questions right now lol

02:23:27
<transcript>: We're all remote. But one when I say not remote, like, works with eli. Where eli lives. I don't want a doxy life. He doesn't want people to know where he lives. Nevada. I'll just say that.

02:23:27
<transcript>: that's a big place

02:23:29
<transcript>: That's a big place.

02:23:29
<transcript>: so he lives

02:23:43
<transcript>: So he lives in Nevada, Nevada, Nevada. We live in Nevada, and one of the engineers lives out there with them. And then some of the creatives and business folk live there as well. People who are like work on the community and stuff. They live out there as well.

02:23:47
<transcript>: But the engineering team is mostly remote. There's just four of us now.

02:23:47
<transcript>: first time

02:23:50
dnbull: sounds like you need a floridian on your team Kappa

02:23:53
<transcript>: First time chat. Welcome to Chad. It's sushi. No rust. I know. Sorry. I would love to pretend like I'm riding. Rest.

02:23:59
teej_dv: i'm writing rust RIGHT NOW

02:24:03
<transcript>: And I know I'd get more likes and follows if I did. Speaking of thank you for the followup code stink oh, and dirt to bleed.

02:24:12
<transcript>: Oh, and Amyashi and cody. Rob, why are people following me in Mass right now? What is happening? Did I get rid of.

02:24:15
teej_dv: getting paid to write rust Kreygasm

02:24:16
<transcript>: Why are so many people following me? I mean, I love it, but why.

02:24:17
dnbull: whats with people obsession with the game rust? That game is still going strong? Kappa

02:24:18
code_stank: should we unfollow?

02:24:19
<transcript>: Pete it's sushi.

02:24:19
<transcript>: it's just getting crazy

02:24:20
<transcript>: It's just getting crazy.

02:24:24
binajmen: I'm exploring myself Astro + Solid, and facing the same question, hence my question :) SolidStart not being stable enough, I think this is a good bet!

02:24:30
<transcript>: Should we unpause? No, no, you're great. I love the follows. I just like you guys do. You know, I'm really close to 30 because we're about to hit it. Coding dreams. Thank you so much.

02:24:33
<transcript>: I think we're like we're.

02:24:35
dingusdev: @teej_dv That's the dream LUL

02:24:35
<transcript>: Seven or eight.

02:24:35
<transcript>: there's another

02:24:38
laytanl_: cause you're doing cool stuff!

02:24:43
<transcript>: There's another one. Glam. Wait, are you guys unfollowing me and refalling me? I think you're messing with me. It's chaps. Thank you for the follow glam. I think you would already followed me.

02:24:51
maleero: Need to get to 3k for that party! PartyHat t3ggParty

02:24:51
austencam: @teej_dv what do you think is the best resource for learning rust?

02:24:53
<transcript>: Fry. I don't know if you'd followed me, but thank you for the follow. Oh, we're too away from 30 because you're doing cool stuff. Okay, apparently, dax, stop it.

02:24:57
binajmen: haha

02:24:59
<transcript>: To get the three K for the party.

02:24:59
<transcript>: yeah

02:25:03
<transcript>: Yeah. Oh, it says three K. Well, it's actually 2998.

02:25:07
<transcript>: 2998.

02:25:08
teej_dv: @austencam you should read (at least some) of the rust book and then try building something yourself

02:25:10
thdxr: about to 2997

02:25:14
<transcript>: Astro is the choice. Are you going to use the content collections? I don't think we'll need the content collections up front.

02:25:14
<transcript>: so i

02:25:17
oetziofficial: LUL

02:25:17
<transcript>: So I followed the two or the whatever release.

02:25:17
<transcript>: whatever that is

02:25:20
glamshatterskull: the book is great

02:25:24
<transcript>: Whatever that is now I'm using two version two of astro. I'm just not using we're not using any markdown.

02:25:26
teej_dv: @teej_dv it's a reality right now for me LUL

02:25:28
<transcript>: So haven't had a reason is that 3000 was that it.

02:25:31
warre_p: 100% the book

02:25:33
glamshatterskull: @austencam seconding what teej said

02:25:36
<transcript>: Hippie and Edward, thank you for the follows. It says two, nine, nine. I don't know if it's up to if it's if it's up to date.

02:25:44
<transcript>: I don't know. Okay, I'm just gonna come up here because I'm very distracted because of the follow spree. I'm gonna try and catch a bunch at.

02:25:52
dingusdev: @austencam Rustlings is pretty good too.

02:25:57
<transcript>: I'm exploring myself astro plus solid and facing the same question hints my question solves aren't not being stable enough. I think this is a good bet. Ooh bindiga Bingeman.

02:25:57
<transcript>: benjamin

02:25:58
<transcript>: Benjamin.

02:25:58
<transcript>: you could

02:26:03
<transcript>: You could get yourself a job real quick. You know the stack, you know the space, you know things.

02:26:03
<transcript>: you

02:26:06
glamshatterskull: i am not getting paid to write rust... YET

02:26:06
<transcript>: You said things that are very intelligent.

02:26:08
austencam: Thanks :) I've learned a bit but have only referenced random book pages and hacked stuff together in Tauri <3

02:26:18
<transcript>: Let's see. I just have a lot of projects going. Any Tory plans for an App 3002. Thank you so much for the follows. Tuna and Edward again. No, I already saw that one. And Edward.

02:26:18
<transcript>: i'm just gonna say it again

02:26:23
<transcript>: I'm just gonna say it again because I started to 3002 people at 30 followers.

02:26:23
<transcript>: when i

02:26:27
mattmancodes: larabars for all

02:26:44
<transcript>: When I hit the thousands, we have parties. So tomorrow party. I don't know what we're doing yet. I now feel bad because you guys might have all followed thinking we just drop everything into the party right now. I'm just not prepared. I've got to make plans for a party. I've got to get decorations. I've got to think of a prize. Make sure my overlays work.

02:26:44
<transcript>: for give

02:26:46
<transcript>: For giveaways August.

02:26:46
<transcript>: thank you so much

02:26:49
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the Follow August.

02:26:52
glamshatterskull: parties are serious business

02:26:57
<transcript>: What are Toy plans for an app in the future? Since you're on vets builder with astro, I don't even know what Tory is.

02:26:57
<transcript>: feel like

02:26:59
<transcript>: Feel like I should.

02:27:00
<transcript>: Things.

02:27:13
<transcript>: Gloss over that I'm gonna slow down? Thank you so much for that follow. I say it so many times.

02:27:13
<transcript>: i mean i said three

02:27:15
oetziofficial: tauri is the better electron, written in rust

02:27:15
<transcript>: I mean I said 3000 times now.

02:27:18
<transcript>: That I start to glass over it.

02:27:18
<transcript>: think of it

02:27:19
<transcript>: Think of it.

02:27:19
<transcript>: stra

02:27:23
statsndata: Definitely no need to know Tauri.

02:27:24
<transcript>: Straight on. Or I'm like, what is that? I just kind of mumble through it.

02:27:24
<transcript>: i need to slow down

02:27:26
<transcript>: I need to slow down.

02:27:26
<transcript>: thank you so much

02:27:29
austencam: Tauri is an electron competitor that uses Rust instead of node for the desktop side

02:27:32
<transcript>: Thank you so much for that follow. I really do appreciate it. I'm quite new here, but I understand some of these things. Interesting.

02:27:32
<transcript>: oh

02:27:32
binajmen: After 2 minutes of work, you were soooo close to start and implement the `interface Visual` ;D

02:27:36
<transcript>: Oh, dax is talking about stuff he's working on. Yeah. Dax is working on too many things.

02:27:41
<transcript>: Like I thought I was working on too many things. Dax is definitely working on too many things.

02:27:41
<transcript>: is it

02:27:50
<transcript>: Is it solid? Start on Beta? Yes, I believe so. Coding Dreams welcome to Chat. Also, Chris the Man guy. Dude, I really appreciate that. Follow.

02:28:01
<transcript>: This is nice. Slowing down a little bit. Can I have a Stampy's job if I can specialize in mba? What do you do? Stats and data with a name like that? I feel like you do some things with stats.

02:28:01
<transcript>: potentially

02:28:03
<transcript>: Potentially data.

02:28:07
<transcript>: Answering a bunch of solstart questions right now.

02:28:11
glamshatterskull: detective

02:28:15
<transcript>: Sounds like you need a Floridian on your team. Actually lived in Florida. The inbow. I lived in naples, Florida, for six months. We moved there.

02:28:24
<transcript>: Wow, go. Then we move back because we had our second child. I'm writing rush right now. Tease is running rest right now getting paid to.

02:28:25
thdxr: adam alreayd has a floridian on his team

02:28:30
<transcript>: I know inevitably I will end up writing rest at some point in my career.

02:28:30
<transcript>: because

02:28:33
<transcript>: Because I'm too curious, even if I do it for myself. Just for fun.

02:28:33
<transcript>: i just have not

02:28:37
code_stank: rust or bust!

02:28:41
<transcript>: I just have not found that break in the clouds and like the number of things I am currently trying to do, I've not found that moment.

02:28:41
<transcript>: what

02:28:46
<transcript>: What's with people's obsession with the game rust that game is still going strong.

02:28:49
<transcript>: Is it a game.

02:28:49
<transcript>: i'm

02:28:53
<transcript>: I'm exploring Astrosault. Okay, I already read that. That's the dream.

02:28:57
<transcript>: S, three K. Oh, wow. I'm so behind. That was a long time ago.

02:28:57
<transcript>: the

02:28:59
deenr: hiiii

02:29:01
<transcript>: The book the book is great the rest book.

02:29:01
<transcript>: you should read

02:29:04
<transcript>: You should read at least some of the rest book. I started reading the rest book.

02:29:10
thdxr: I love rust the corrosive material

02:29:11
dnbull: The average person knows rust as a game and not as a language.

02:29:11
phdhorrible: I got a job offer for embedded Rust recently. Wanted to say yes just to work with Rust, but not with embedded

02:29:20
<transcript>: Okay, you guys are just talking about rest. I'm gonna skip ahead lar Bars for all. Oh, I did say I think back when we had our 20 party, I think I said I would send somebody a box of lar bars.

02:29:20
<transcript>: did not

02:29:24
<transcript>: Did not. That would give away boxes of larabars. I think I set it.

02:29:31
<transcript>: Tari is the better electron written in rust so better electron I hear electron is a low bar.

02:29:31
<transcript>: to clear

02:29:32
<transcript>: To clear.

02:29:34
<transcript>: That's what I hear.

02:29:40
<transcript>: Tai tari is an electron competitor that uses rest instead of node for the desktop side. Okay.

02:29:44
<transcript>: After two minutes away, you were so close to starting.

02:29:45
thdxr: embedded is fun!

02:29:50
<transcript>: Didn't I just say I can't do anything else until I finish.

02:29:50
<transcript>: that

02:29:57
glamshatterskull: literally coded for like 10 mins

02:29:59
<transcript>: That page. We're gonna go back and finish that page. I've got time. I still got an hour. Oh, tease. If you're still here, I implemented an auto Zoom in whenever I make.

02:29:59
<transcript>: big expressions

02:30:01
code_stank: i would totally want to do embedded work

02:30:01
<transcript>: Big expressions like.

02:30:10
<transcript>: But I never make this expression. So the model, just, like, gets bored and decides to Zoom in it's like, that. Was that an expression.

02:30:14
<transcript>: I do already have a fluoride on my team. And not you. Dax.

02:30:14
<transcript>: actually

02:30:18
<transcript>: Actually, I do. One of our engineers lives in in Florida, near Orlando.

02:30:28
<transcript>: The average person knows russ is a game and not as a language. I didn't even know rest of the game. I only knew it is a language. I guess I'm a super nerd.

02:30:33
binajmen: I'm from Belgium, that would make a 24/24 dev team ;)

02:30:34
<transcript>: I got a job offer for Embedded Rest recently wanted to say yes just to work with Rest, but not with embedded.

02:30:34
<transcript>: that sounds

02:30:37
<transcript>: That sounds cool. What.

02:30:37
<transcript>: what

02:30:41
<transcript>: What is embedded? Is it like on devices.

02:30:41
<transcript>: is it just

02:30:42
<transcript>: Is it just like.

02:30:42
<transcript>: iot

02:30:46
<transcript>: Iot kind of stuff like it's embedded in a device.

02:30:46
<transcript>: is it kind of like

02:30:49
<transcript>: Is it kind of like Firmware? We talked about firmware earlier.

02:30:55
tymekdev: I remember when Rust the game lost all its EU data due to data center fire and not having it anywhere else...

02:31:02
<transcript>: Dax. Embedded is fun. Of course you would know what embedded is. X. You've done so many fun things. You worked on. Firmware. Literally coded, like ten minutes. Did I even code? I think I pulled up my editor for ten minutes.

02:31:06
<transcript>: I'm from Belgium. That would make a 24 24 dev team.

02:31:06
<transcript>: oh like always

02:31:08
daglee: @thdxr Sure you are not a "florida man"?

02:31:08
<transcript>: Oh like always working.

02:31:08
<transcript>: around the

02:31:18
<transcript>: Around the clock. I probably have the same working hours as you, Benjamin, living in Belgium. I wake up really early in the morning and I take off really early afternoon.

02:31:24
<transcript>: My time in the US I remember when rest the game lost all its EU data due to data.

02:31:24
<transcript>: center

02:31:26
<transcript>: Center fighter and not having anywhere else.

02:31:26
<transcript>: that sounds awesome

02:31:28
phdhorrible: Yeah, it was for low-level firmware for camera systems

02:31:31
<transcript>: That sounds awesome. Oh, it zoomed in. I actually made a face. Organically.

02:31:34
statsndata: A data analyst for oil and gas currently but the college passion was sports analytics. Now I'd rather just contribute to making the Houston rockets' play better.

02:31:35
<transcript>: It's an awful page.

02:31:39
<transcript>: Sure you are not a Florida man.

02:31:42
statsndata: I think I might as well use the car degree for that

02:31:43
<transcript>: For camera systems. Okay.

02:31:46
statsndata: So I'm in statmuse every day

02:31:51
warre_p: @binajmen Hi fellow Belgian, you're a dev as well I assume? :)

02:31:51
<transcript>: Okay, so Sassidated, you're a data analyst for Oil and Gas currently.

02:31:51
<transcript>: with a

02:32:00
<transcript>: With a College passion was sports analytics. Now I'd rather just contribute to making the Houston Rockets play better. You are not the only Rockets fan here.

02:32:00
<transcript>: i think

02:32:06
<transcript>: I think I might as well use the car degree for that. So I'm in stat me every day. You use statmes every day.

02:32:06
<transcript>: that is so cool

02:32:07
<transcript>: That is so cool.

02:32:08
glamshatterskull: YOOO

02:32:16
glamshatterskull: also a rockets fan... for life

02:32:17
<transcript>: I should I should probably update the title of the Thing glam. Also, Rocket, sand, glam, and stats. You guys should hang out.

02:32:21
<transcript>: Build.

02:32:24
binajmen: @binajmen I am ;)

02:32:24
statsndata: CS* degree not car

02:32:27
statsndata: GALMMMMM

02:32:28
<transcript>: Com with astro and SSE.

02:32:38
<transcript>: I'm updating my title. I don't want people to show up now that the office tour is over and be like, where's the Office? Stewart? And I'll be like, Sorry you missed it. This just feels bad.

02:32:42
<transcript>: I lost all my chat. I have no chat anymore.

02:32:43
glamshatterskull: olajuwon is the goat and i am not taking any questions

02:32:53
statsndata: how you're surviving the season best you can brother (or sister)

02:32:57
statsndata: Or them

02:32:58
<transcript>: I thought it would still show me chat when I came back to this page. That's okay, elijah. Elijahuan is the goat, and I'm not taking any questions. Okay, let's get back to actually working. We got people that use statmes here. They probably want to see me build stack news.

02:32:58
<transcript>: how your

02:33:01
<transcript>: How your surviving the season best you can brother.

02:33:01
stupac62: keep it in the title and tell them to watch the VOD

02:33:06
glamshatterskull: i want silas gone

02:33:06
<transcript>: Yeah, the Rockets aren't so good right now, are they? But they're gonna get windy.

02:33:13
glamshatterskull: and we need wemby

02:33:13
<transcript>: Keep it in the title and tell them to watch savad. Yeah. I guess that's another option.

02:33:15
<transcript>: Okay.

02:33:15
<transcript>: so we're building

02:33:18
<transcript>: So we're building stamps.

02:33:18
<transcript>: we're gonna

02:33:21
statsndata: Silas is the in-between to the in-between coach.

02:33:24
<transcript>: We're gonna finish this page, people. We're doing it. Oh, yeah, I gotta get the interface. The interface? Oh, no.

02:33:25
statsndata: The tank commander

02:33:30
statsndata: Gaining experience for the next job

02:33:31
<transcript>: Does anyone for me yesterday? Remember why I'm saying, oh, no, right now.

02:33:31
<transcript>: what was that

02:33:35
<transcript>: What was that thing called Dot tools? What was it called.

02:33:39
<transcript>: I claim I've restarted my machine.

02:33:39
<transcript>: what was

02:33:39
glamshatterskull: it's wild how much better we play with porter back

02:33:43
<transcript>: What was the thing that converted the json payload to the interface.

02:33:46
<transcript>: That I now no longer have because.

02:33:49
thdxr: transform.tools

02:33:52
stupac62: no search history?

02:33:54
<transcript>: Three minutes, copy and pasting text Tee You would have had a heart attack if you're still here. Transform tools.

02:33:58
<transcript>: Like it was the least smart way ever.

02:33:58
<transcript>: it's

02:34:01
<transcript>: It's gone, it's gone.

02:34:05
stupac62: You need onetab extension

02:34:07
<transcript>: Not like this.

02:34:10
<transcript>: What a bummer.

02:34:12
<transcript>: Well.

02:34:13
thdxr: might as well give up now

02:34:14
statsndata: KPJ is our leader but JG still our best player

02:34:17
thdxr: and work on rebase

02:34:18
<transcript>: I have the side up. It does not have the data and it's still. I thought maybe it would.

02:34:19
stupac62: Oh nevermind

02:34:20
<transcript>: Well.

02:34:23
<transcript>: Might as well give up now and we're gonna rebate.

02:34:25
binajmen: @thdxr lul

02:34:28
<transcript>: It was very much my attitude.

02:34:33
statsndata: KPJ a need though every game @glamshatterskull

02:34:35
spotmonk: you only need to spend another 5 minutes copying thousands of lines of text

02:34:37
<transcript>: I could write it by hand.

02:34:37
<transcript>: i can't

02:34:39
<transcript>: I can't believe I did that.

02:34:45
<transcript>: Well, here's what I could do. I could just.

02:34:45
<transcript>: copy

02:34:47
<transcript>: Copy.

02:34:47
<transcript>: maybe

02:34:49
<transcript>: Maybe just go with this.

02:34:54
<transcript>: Visual the problem was.

02:35:04
<transcript>: Summary. It was detail here. This. I was worried. Are there other kinds of detail in this thing? I think there are. I need to do the smart thing.

02:35:04
<transcript>: i need to do

02:35:07
<transcript>: I need to do smart typescript thing where I define all these different shapes.

02:35:09
<transcript>: I'm gonna do it.

02:35:17
<transcript>: Alan has been another five minutes copying thousands of lines of text. That's true. Spot. Monk. Don't tempt me. I will do it.

02:35:19
sockthedev: zod!

02:35:20
<transcript>: Here's what I could do here's what I got.

02:35:20
glamshatterskull: @statsndata i find green wildly inconsistent... i would say sengun is our super star and eason is wildly underappreciated. he's doing way more than jabari sadly.

02:35:23
stupac62: I got it. Buy an enterprise server (GAS purchase). Virtualize a desktop. Connect to virtual desktop. Then when you reboot your client machine you won't lose that data Kappa

02:35:25
<transcript>: Camera. Here's what I could do.

02:35:29
<transcript>: Just copy it from here.

02:35:29
<transcript>: maybe

02:35:30
<transcript>: Maybe.

02:35:33
<transcript>: Who I bet I could.

02:35:40
<transcript>: Zod. What should I use zod for sock.

02:35:43
<transcript>: Everybody's so obsessed with zod.

02:35:45
<transcript>: zodia

02:35:45
<transcript>: zodia ma'am

02:35:51
<transcript>: Zodia? Ma'am, I'm not sure I understand why. I mean, like, I just haven't done the work to understand why.

02:35:51
<transcript>: not like

02:35:55
<transcript>: Not like you're wrong for being obsessed with that. I just don't. I haven't done the work.

02:35:56
thdxr: just wait till you see how much we use zod in the rebase codebase

02:36:00
<transcript>: Okay, let's just do this. I'm gonna call the api with a game.

02:36:02
<transcript>: Is this the ID? I don't know.

02:36:02
<transcript>: maybe

02:36:04
<transcript>: Maybe.

02:36:08
<transcript>: Probably not.

02:36:13
<transcript>: It is. No. I didn't understand your question. That's not. That's. Not it.

02:36:13
<transcript>: what's the game

02:36:14
<transcript>: What's the game? Id.

02:36:25
<transcript>: I guess I could look at I know I could find out.

02:36:27
<transcript>: That's gonna be in here.

02:36:28
stupac62: maybe 31009

02:36:31
statsndata: Eason definitely our Tucker in disguise. And Sengun is getting amply deserved spotlight. But JG HAS to go through this when you think about it. Expose his bag and refine it for years 4-6 when he's expected to flourish with development.

02:36:32
<transcript>: Oh, here's the text. Am I doing it? Am I just copy and paste.

02:36:32
<transcript>: of code

02:36:32
ayushsharma: do you use aws for this ?

02:36:38
<transcript>: Of code. Two days in a row. I might be doing it before someone tell me the smart way. What's the smart way to do this.

02:36:41
glamshatterskull: this resonated with me so hard today https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/11lipvr/i_must_be_the_only_guy_that_understands/

02:36:42
<transcript>: Can someone tell me the smart way.

02:36:51
<transcript>: I just wait till you see how much we use on the rebase code base. Yeah. I noticed that when you're showing me yesterday, we use Odd. I didn't even know we used that.

02:36:51
coolpantstv: have chaptgpt do it

02:36:56
coolpantstv: chatgpt*

02:36:57
<transcript>: Do you use AWS for this? Yes. A yush. We do use AWS for this.

02:37:00
binajmen: npm run dev > temp.log

02:37:04
statsndata: I believe all scores have this phase. If not just a stereotypical sophomore slump

02:37:05
<transcript>: Somebody tells me how how do I copy a ton of text from my terminal.

02:37:05
<transcript>: anybody

02:37:06
<transcript>: Anybody.

02:37:09
tymekdev: @binajmen This

02:37:15
<transcript>: Mpm rundown.

02:37:15
tymekdev: And then cat temp.log | pbcopy

02:37:16
turki_9999999: ctrl c

02:37:18
code_stank: pbcopy

02:37:21
austencam: use cat | pbcopy

02:37:23
<transcript>: And then cat templog PB copy. Well, it's not the whole log. I just be part of the log.

02:37:26
<transcript>: I don't need the whole log.

02:37:28
binajmen: exactly

02:37:30
laytanl_: command | pbcopy

02:37:32
<transcript>: You saying I should just have this thing log and then okay.

02:37:35
<transcript>: Command, pb, copy.

02:37:37
<transcript>: So.

02:37:42
<transcript>: So I'm gonna kill my Dev server, and you're saying I should do.

02:37:43
stupac62: jq to help select it?

02:37:45
<transcript>: Pmp Dev.

02:37:45
binajmen: kill the process

02:37:50
<transcript>: And then you're saying, I can just PB copy. No.

02:37:50
glamshatterskull: @statsndata i just don't feel like green is the guy... to me he's more the guy next to the guy who can sometimes be the guy when he needs to be.

02:37:54
daglee: Open a terminal in neovim, select the text in neovim and paste?

02:37:54
<transcript>: Build the process. Okay. Keep going. Benjamin. I'm watching. I'm listening.

02:38:05
<transcript>: Dagly that's what I did yesterday. People made fun of me. Open a terminal in the oven. Select the text of me, of them and paste.

02:38:05
<transcript>: that's what i did

02:38:06
<transcript>: That's what I did.

02:38:06
<transcript>: it took a while

02:38:08
laytanl_: Maybe doesn't work this way

02:38:09
<transcript>: It took a while through my like three minutes of dragging.

02:38:14
binajmen: maybe piping to pbcopy. I would have redirect to a logfile with >

02:38:17
<transcript>: Live with a Jack. Thank you so much for that. Follow.

02:38:19
bubakek: don't indent = less lines to copy :D

02:38:25
stupac62: fewer

02:38:29
<transcript>: Maybe doesn't work this way. Open a terminal in the oven. Wait. Now maybe piping to pb copy. I would have redirect. Well, how about I just do this.

02:38:29
statsndata: So Brad Beal with John Wall @glamshatterskull  before he became Brad Beal

02:38:30
daglee: Dragging? You use mouse in neovim? D:

02:38:31
<transcript>: How about I just do this.

02:38:31
<transcript>: i'm going

02:38:33
turki_9999999: do you workout and if say how do you fit it into ur day @adamdotdev

02:38:33
<transcript>: I'm going to.

02:38:33
<transcript>: encode

02:38:36
binajmen: perhaps `| pbcopy` would work directly

02:38:36
<transcript>: Encode. I'm gonna write it to a file or something.

02:38:37
aaaaliou: de-zoom your terminal and copy?

02:38:45
<transcript>: Turkey. Do you work out? And if so, how do you fit it into your day? I got through phases where I'm pretty good about working out.

02:38:46
glamshatterskull: @statsndata you see where i am coming from...

02:38:53
<transcript>: I also go through phases where I'm terrible at it. But when I do, I try to, like, go for walks, on phone calls.

02:38:53
<transcript>: that

02:38:55
<transcript>: That helps.

02:39:05
<transcript>: I've gotten into rucking, where I like carry ¬£40 on my back or whatever 30, ¬£40 and like a backpack and you go for walks and it's a little more taxing.

02:39:10
<transcript>: Your terminal and copy. Oh, you can.

02:39:11
glamshatterskull: the backpack plates

02:39:22
glamshatterskull: i knew a ton of ruckers back when that game ingress came out

02:39:23
spotmonk: I carry 40lbs on my belly when I go for walks, but that's not on purpose

02:39:24
<transcript>: Use the mouth and meal them. I do sometimes I like that we have a Houston Rocket. The conversation going on in chat right now that makes me feel so good. Like sports fans have arrived.

02:39:24
<transcript>: shint

02:39:25
laytanl_: `fs.writeFileSync('out.json', data)`

02:39:26
<transcript>: Shinta thanks so much for the follow.

02:39:32
statsndata: @glamshatterskull DEFINITELY! Just don't want you to lost hope too soon. We've got a walking 40 ball under 23

02:39:33
stupac62: @Spotmonk same. same

02:39:34
<transcript>: You care for testing belly? That's funny. Okay. Yeah. Let's just write the data. Let's just do this.

02:39:34
<transcript>: let's just do this

02:39:36
<transcript>: Let's just do this data.

02:39:36
<transcript>: let's just

02:39:40
<transcript>: Let's just say a weight FS.

02:39:43
<transcript>: Import.

02:39:43
<transcript>: import

02:39:44
<transcript>: Import.

02:39:46
binajmen: yeah that works too ^^

02:39:48
<transcript>: Fs. Promises.

02:39:51
<transcript>: Sfs from FFS.

02:39:53
<transcript>: Right. And then.

02:39:53
<transcript>: await

02:39:54
<transcript>: Await.

02:39:57
<transcript>: Yes.

02:39:59
<transcript>: Thank you.

02:39:59
<transcript>: pop

02:40:01
<transcript>: Popilot, look at that.

02:40:05
glamshatterskull: @statsndata i've been a rockets fan forever.. i was at the summit. i ain't losing any hope ever. :D

02:40:05
<transcript>: What's wrong with this? Oh, is it need to be like node.

02:40:05
<transcript>: f

02:40:07
<transcript>: Fs or something.

02:40:11
<transcript>: I find module. Note if that's what's corresponding Typed up duration.

02:40:15
<transcript>: Do this in Astro not you use note stuff.

02:40:19
<transcript>: I could.

02:40:25
<transcript>: Promise, this.

02:40:27
<transcript>: Is that wrong.

02:40:29
<transcript>: Module node FS.

02:40:31
thdxr: lowercase node

02:40:36
<transcript>: Import FS from FS.

02:40:36
<transcript>: oh

02:40:36
statsndata: I love it. I've been grandfathered in but was following closely since the end of the Kevin Martin era

02:40:37
mattmancodes: `@types/node`?

02:40:39
laytanl_: Idk about astro stuff

02:40:39
<transcript>: Oh, fs products like that. I'm so down.

02:40:43
<transcript>: Count module if this promises, what.

02:40:52
<transcript>: I have to add type node. Maybe it'll just work. Maybe they'll just complain. It'll still work. One of those kind of things where typescript lies or something.

02:40:52
<transcript>: oh

02:40:54
<transcript>: Oh no such file or director.

02:40:54
<transcript>: i

02:40:57
<transcript>: I have to create the file first.

02:40:57
<transcript>: source data

02:41:01
<transcript>: Source data game json I don't want to put it there I want to put it.

02:41:04
<transcript>: Just game json.

02:41:10
<transcript>: And then I'll just go ahead and create that file.

02:41:15
<transcript>: Oh, it's there. Oh, did it work.

02:41:27
<transcript>: Do what it works. It reload it. Just refresh the page. I bet. Okay, cool. Here it is. Guys. We did it now. I know how to copy it. I know how to copy that. You know, I'm saying just like that.

02:41:27
<transcript>: now we're

02:41:28
glamshatterskull: @statsndata i was at a party watching the rockets in the other room the night 13 in 30 happened LUL

02:41:29
<transcript>: Now we're gonna paste it in here.

02:41:33
<transcript>: And it's gonna generate, Oh.

02:41:35
<transcript>: What's wrong.

02:41:37
<transcript>: Unable to parse.

02:41:40
<transcript>: Something wrong.

02:41:42
<transcript>: Nlg.

02:41:44
<transcript>: Text.

02:41:46
<transcript>: Visual.

02:41:49
<transcript>: What's wrong here? Oh.

02:41:49
<transcript>: it

02:41:51
<transcript>: It doubled that up or something.

02:41:56
<transcript>: Average. That average should not be there.

02:41:59
<transcript>: Okay. I think it's like this.

02:42:02
<transcript>: There we go, we did it.

02:42:02
<transcript>: we're back

02:42:03
<transcript>: We're back.

02:42:04
statsndata: One of Stern's best scripts if you ask me @glamshatterskull

02:42:06
<transcript>: Okay.

02:42:06
<transcript>: now i can

02:42:09
<transcript>: Now I can go back here and remove that before I forget.

02:42:14
tymekdev: That's a cool tool

02:42:15
<transcript>: Okay.

02:42:18
<transcript>: On keycaster.

02:42:19
glamshatterskull: i'll never forget that night ever LUL

02:42:23
<transcript>: I'm like 45 minutes left in my stream and I'm just now turning on keycaster.

02:42:23
<transcript>: i'm a professional

02:42:25
<transcript>: I'm a professional streamer people.

02:42:27
statsndata: Because why did the Spurs turn it over so easily on the baseline

02:42:29
<transcript>: Okay.

02:42:33
<transcript>: Here we go. We got some interfaces. Now.

02:42:37
<transcript>: Visual. This is visual.

02:42:57
<transcript>: Summary and in detail, this is where we're gonna get fancy with the typescript. We're gonna have different types of details.

02:42:57
<transcript>: it's gonna be

02:42:59
<transcript>: It's gonna be based on.

02:43:04
<transcript>: I might not be smart enough for this. It needs to be based on the.

02:43:09
<transcript>: Type. Oh, I am smart enough for this. I've done this before.

02:43:09
<transcript>: i think

02:43:11
<transcript>: I think I've done this before.

02:43:14
<transcript>: Summary.

02:43:17
<transcript>: Has an answer to what is that.

02:43:21
<transcript>: Text type emit leading space and entity.

02:43:21
<transcript>: feel like i've seen

02:43:24
<transcript>: Feel like I've seen that? Yeah? Answer one.

02:43:26
<transcript>: What.

02:43:33
spotmonk: I love that feeling where I realize I may not be smart enough today, but I was smart enough like 2 weeks ago

02:43:34
<transcript>: I guess I should have this.

02:43:34
<transcript>: we'll just add

02:43:37
<transcript>: We'll just add this answer type.

02:43:41
<transcript>: Nlg.

02:43:44
<transcript>: I figure this out. People.

02:43:44
<transcript>: an entity

02:43:48
<transcript>: An entity already had that type, but this answer is going to be.

02:43:48
<transcript>: an array

02:43:50
<transcript>: An array.

02:43:51
<transcript>: Of.

02:43:54
<transcript>: Answers.

02:43:56
statsndata: @glamshatterskull how do you feel about the Harden Homecoming potential?

02:43:59
<transcript>: Okay. And then SSL okay, that's fine. Nlg.

02:43:59
<transcript>: i'm gonna say this

02:44:01
<transcript>: I'm gonna say this is optional. I think it is.

02:44:12
<transcript>: Answer nlg. And then down here we've got summary. I thought already added summary. Did I not.

02:44:15
<transcript>: Here we go.

02:44:17
<transcript>: Summary.

02:44:22
<transcript>: Okay.

02:44:22
<transcript>: that's not

02:44:23
<transcript>: That's not answered. Two.

02:44:23
<transcript>: answer

02:44:24
<transcript>: Answer.

02:44:28
<transcript>: Subject. What is a subject.

02:44:34
<transcript>: It's an actor Geez so much stuff.

02:44:37
<transcript>: Thank you for the following most soccer.

02:44:44
glamshatterskull: @statsndata i am super duper in to it tbqh. he should've had an mvp the year they gave it to russ for triple doubles

02:44:49
<transcript>: Some of this stuff is too specific.

02:44:49
<transcript>: to this

02:44:51
livemahs: very gloomy here in the ozarks today man. I'm ready for 70+ days everyday!!

02:44:51
<transcript>: To this shape.

02:44:51
<transcript>: but

02:44:53
<transcript>: But.

02:45:06
<transcript>: Hey, Live, maz. Very gloomy, very gloomy here in the ozarks today. Ready for 70 plus days every day. Same here.

02:45:10
<transcript>: Live maz. Also in the ozarks just like me.

02:45:14
<transcript>: Okay.

02:45:16
<transcript>: Text.

02:45:16
<transcript>: to

02:45:17
<transcript>: To.

02:45:17
<transcript>: i think

02:45:21
<transcript>: I think we just need the original text.

02:45:25
<transcript>: Yeah, answer and prompt conversational.

02:45:30
<transcript>: So much of this stuff is like.

02:45:34
<transcript>: Similar, but different.

02:45:41
<transcript>: Visual. So I need to get the summary. I just started the summary thing. I need a subject.

02:45:42
statsndata: @glamshatterskull I'm a 6/10 on it. It comes down to who we pay to costar in the main role player slot. As well as if we ever get interior help (pending Wemby)

02:45:45
<transcript>: Here's a subject which also has an actor.

02:45:45
<transcript>: oh

02:45:47
<transcript>: Oh, God, this is so confusing.

02:45:53
<transcript>: I mean, I totally know what I'm doing.

02:45:53
<transcript>: and then next we'll

02:45:54
<transcript>: And then next we'll.

02:45:57
<transcript>: Anyone who's watching.

02:45:59
<transcript>: Narrator.

02:46:06
<transcript>: This is kind of a mess.

02:46:11
<transcript>: Like there's a better way to have done this, but.

02:46:13
<transcript>: We are.

02:46:13
<transcript>: okay

02:46:17
statsndata: @glamshatterskull I assume we pay a guard then hopefully pay a costar forward. And draft a big

02:46:18
<transcript>: Okay, so we have narrator that's just gonna be text, not text. Two.

02:46:20
<transcript>: I need a colors.

02:46:23
<transcript>: That's just entity.

02:46:26
<transcript>: What is ID.

02:46:30
<transcript>: Sounds like I don't need an interface for ID.

02:46:36
<transcript>: Oh, wow, this is crazy.

02:46:46
<transcript>: Okay.

02:46:46
<transcript>: i'm gonna start

02:46:48
<transcript>: I'm gonna start just getting.

02:46:48
<transcript>: practical

02:46:55
<transcript>: Practical here ID and type. I'm not making an interface for that. That sounds dumb.

02:47:05
<transcript>: Okay, actor has a year that doesn't sound right but okay.

02:47:07
<transcript>: Colors.

02:47:10
<transcript>: Our foreground and background.

02:47:10
glamshatterskull: i would love for us to have a true pg... kpj does good work but you can see he'd be comfier in the 2

02:47:12
<transcript>: Geez.

02:47:15
<transcript>: What a mess.

02:47:19
<transcript>: Okay. So a subject. This is so nested. I shouldn't do this way.

02:47:19
<transcript>: answer

02:47:23
<transcript>: Answer. Subject. Narrator, text.

02:47:30
<transcript>: Then that was summary. Then visually, the detail. This is the part I actually care about, and we're just now getting to it.

02:47:35
<transcript>: What a mess.

02:47:35
<transcript>: organization

02:47:37
<transcript>: Organization score.

02:47:46
<transcript>: Okay.

02:47:59
freedomdao: greet <3

02:48:06
<transcript>: Let's go ahead and do summary tokens. Welcome to Chat Freedom Day. Oh.

02:48:06
<transcript>: day oh

02:48:08
<transcript>: Day. Oh, Also, thank you for the follow.

02:48:13
<transcript>: We're gonna have a party tomorrow for 30 followers.

02:48:15
<transcript>: Very excited.

02:48:15
<transcript>: about

02:48:17
<transcript>: About 30 followers.

02:48:22
<transcript>: What was that? Looking for? Summary tokens.

02:48:30
<transcript>: You're probably like, search on the page and save a lot of time, but do I look like a person who's trying to save a lot of time? I guess. Yeah.

02:48:30
<transcript>: summary

02:48:32
<transcript>: Summary. There we go.

02:48:34
freedomdao: ive very interesting to learn about astro and sst. i've never seen the workflow .

02:48:35
<transcript>: Summary token.

02:48:35
<transcript>: feel like

02:48:39
<transcript>: Feel like we have five interfaces that look just like this.

02:48:49
<transcript>: Like this one up here. This INLD is that not the same as this text down. Where is that text.

02:48:49
<transcript>: then i

02:48:52
<transcript>: Then I have a text type text interface.

02:48:52
<transcript>: i know i had

02:48:55
<transcript>: I know. I had one. Where is it.

02:48:58
statsndata: I tweeted and stand by the fact that Harden's offensive dominance of the mid 2010s will continue underappreciated for at least 3-5 more years. He's getting the AI treatment.

02:48:59
<transcript>: There. Oh, no.

02:49:00
<transcript>: This undid stuff.

02:49:03
<transcript>: I know, I did. Where is it.

02:49:03
<transcript>: text

02:49:04
<transcript>: Text.

02:49:10
<transcript>: Where is that.

02:49:14
<transcript>: Oh, it's like a typescript text.

02:49:16
<transcript>: That's not what it's supposed to be.

02:49:21
<transcript>: It's supposed to be an interface in here, somewhere.

02:49:31
<transcript>: This right here.

02:49:31
<transcript>: is the text

02:49:33
<transcript>: Is the text interface.

02:49:40
<transcript>: And let's look at this so that should be text then because that's the same as that.

02:49:40
<transcript>: so

02:49:41
<transcript>: So.

02:49:41
<transcript>: this should be

02:49:43
<transcript>: This should be text.

02:49:48
<transcript>: And then that. Ssml. I feel like I already have a thing for that. Don't I.

02:49:50
statsndata: @adamdotdev did I miss that you're deploying with sst in your stack?

02:49:52
<transcript>: Maybe not.

02:49:52
livemahs: @statsndata he was nasty

02:49:54
<transcript>: Pre prompt conversational.

02:49:54
<transcript>: that is just one

02:49:56
<transcript>: That is just one of those. Okay.

02:50:05
statsndata: @livemahs ‚ô•Ô∏è

02:50:15
<transcript>: Let's see. I'm very interested to learn about astro and ssd. I've never seen the workflow. Well, cool. That's what we're building with. Oh, I put it in title. Didn't I tweeted and stand by the fact that hardens offensive dominance of the Mint. Okay, you guys are talking about the rocket. Did I miss that you're deploying with ssc in your stack? We are deploying with ssd in our stack.

02:50:17
<transcript>: Ssd's, Very good.

02:50:17
<transcript>: and

02:50:20
<transcript>: And I don't just say that because I'm friends with DAX.

02:50:26
thdxr: eh SST is whatever

02:50:27
<transcript>: I think for the follow self division.

02:50:27
<transcript>: that's the name i

02:50:29
<transcript>: That's the name I can read.

02:50:32
<transcript>: Ssd is whatever it's, whatever.

02:50:37
<transcript>: I feel like there's some like redundancy here.

02:50:39
<transcript>: Like this.

02:50:39
<transcript>: what's different about

02:50:43
statsndata: Was that pre-Astro too?

02:50:44
<transcript>: What's different about these summary token versus answer text type.

02:50:44
<transcript>: emit leading

02:50:49
<transcript>: Emit leading space and then optional entity. I feel like those could be the same thing.

02:50:54
<transcript>: Those could be the same thing. And I think they should just be called token.

02:51:01
<transcript>: And I'm gonna get rid of this one. No, I'm gonna rename answer.

02:51:01
statsndata: The sst choice

02:51:04
<transcript>: This one.

02:51:07
freedomdao: my name kind hard to say but once u learn it can be good. i made it , means, freedom's pathway.

02:51:08
<transcript>: And then I'm gonna say.

02:51:09
thdxr: no adam never used sst before this lol

02:51:11
<transcript>: Anywhere I have answer. It should be token.

02:51:11
<transcript>: answers are

02:51:15
<transcript>: Answers are an array of tokens. I'm feeling I'm feeling good about this now.

02:51:15
<transcript>: i hated

02:51:18
<transcript>: I hated it for a second. I love it now. I'm excited.

02:51:18
<transcript>: answers

02:51:21
<transcript>: Answers a token and a prompt conversational.

02:51:25
<transcript>: Look at that so similar.

02:51:27
<transcript>: So similar, but different.

02:51:31
thdxr: statmuse was on AWS and sst is really the only way to deploy astro to aws

02:51:34
<transcript>: Okay subject is an actor image, url, colors, entity.

02:51:37
<transcript>: And then colors.

02:51:37
<transcript>: foreground okay

02:51:37
<transcript>: Foreground. Okay.

02:51:41
<transcript>: Actor has a number. I think that's probably optional.

02:51:45
<transcript>: Sorry for all the jays and Case people. I'm not very good at them.

02:51:51
<transcript>: Sam use was on aws and ssc is really the only way to deploy astro to aws it really is.

02:51:55
<transcript>: It truly, truly is.

02:51:55
<transcript>: okay

02:52:01
<transcript>: Okay, visual. Now it's a summary token. Those are not summary tokens anymore. Those are tokens.

02:52:01
<transcript>: ooh this is

02:52:05
<transcript>: Ooh, this is feeling good. Feeling good about this.

02:52:05
<transcript>: i

02:52:06
statsndata: Hahaha so what does is sst stack file consist of so far?

02:52:06
coolpantstv: Sounds like a monopoly to me

02:52:08
<transcript>: I do need to find the summary type.

02:52:12
<transcript>: Summary is this.

02:52:12
<transcript>: okay

02:52:13
statsndata: Just the Astro site

02:52:13
<transcript>: Okay.

02:52:23
<transcript>: Just so many tights that should be answered to should just be answer no, those are token. Those are token. Now.

02:52:27
<transcript>: And then there is a text type, I think right.

02:52:27
<transcript>: hex has

02:52:31
<transcript>: Hex has answer and prompt conversational. Sure that doesn't make any sense.

02:52:36
<transcript>: I'm not building up a very like makes sense in my brain.

02:52:36
<transcript>: therapy

02:52:40
<transcript>: Therapy, but I'm getting some interfaces in place, additional.

02:52:40
<transcript>: questions

02:52:42
<transcript>: Questions.

02:52:42
<transcript>: i have some additional

02:52:43
<transcript>: I have some additional questions.

02:52:43
<transcript>: like what

02:52:45
statsndata: ^? Was meant to be a question

02:52:45
<transcript>: Like, what am I doing.

02:52:45
<transcript>: domain

02:52:47
<transcript>: Domain and text.

02:52:54
<transcript>: I think this is the last one. And I get to do the detail, which is the actual important part.

02:52:58
<transcript>: Visual. Okay, so, conversation, disposition.

02:52:58
<transcript>: tokenization

02:53:02
<transcript>: Tokenization score. I lied. I don't get to do detail yet.

02:53:05
<transcript>: So what's.

02:53:05
<transcript>: the

02:53:08
<transcript>: The ssc stack file consists of so far.

02:53:10
<transcript>: In my in the stavius project.

02:53:10
<transcript>: the ss

02:53:13
<transcript>: The sst, looks like.

02:53:16
<transcript>: There's just an app stack.

02:53:25
<transcript>: It's got an API that I'm not even using yet, and it's got the astrocyte construct. I'm basically only using the astrocyte construct so far.

02:53:34
<transcript>: There will be more, but I just haven't got it yet. It's gonna have to be connected to our V PC. I'm gonna have to set up rds data proxy.

02:53:38
<transcript>: To hit our existing rds database postgres database.

02:53:38
<transcript>: some stuff

02:53:40
<transcript>: Some stuff like that, but I haven't gotten there yet.

02:53:40

<transcript>: And also what is too much? I don't smoke. I'm not a smoker.

02:54:03
statsndata: I want to see all THAAAAAAAT please (with secrets of course)

02:54:03
<transcript>: Sounds like a monopoly to me.

02:54:05
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:54:10

02:54:16
<transcript>: I want to see all that. Please. The secrets. Of course.

02:54:23
<transcript>: Just the astrocyte, yeah, Yeah.

02:54:23

02:54:25
binajmen: because of the over-eating of lavabars. suspicious

02:54:38
<transcript>: That was the question. Yeah, so far, just the azure site, but I'm just building ui right now. I haven't really gotten to like, hooking it up to everything. In fact, I'll need to hook it up to our rds pretty soon to do musings it's like a thing in sat me is where they're stored in our postgres database.

02:54:38
<transcript>: because

02:54:42
<transcript>: Because of the overeating of Larbars suspicious.

<transcript>: like if

02:55:36
<transcript>: Like if you're one that thinks things that aren't fun or fun, you will think this is fun.

02:55:40
<transcript>: Just to say it will not be fun.

02:55:44
<transcript>: We're gonna do the details. So the details.

02:55:44
<transcript>: the

02:55:47
<transcript>: The detailed type that is.

02:55:47
<transcript>: one

02:55:49
<transcript>: One type is this.

02:55:52
<transcript>: Okay.

02:55:55
<transcript>: One type is this thing.

02:55:55
<transcript>: oh no that's

02:56:02
<transcript>: Oh, no. That's player detail. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. I don't actually know where these break off. Let's just do the collapsing thing.

02:56:05
<transcript>: So here's one detail.

02:56:11
<transcript>: Oh, it won't even collapse? See that we broke it.

02:56:14
statsndata: This stream is very well timed after I just spent last night binging the sst YouTube channel

02:56:15
<transcript>: We broke.

02:56:19
laytanl_: @thdxr just need a gasping thumbnail and you will blow up

02:56:20
<transcript>: It to clickbait. I'm not joking. I hate ssd. Follow me to find out why.

02:56:30
<transcript>: This stream is very well timed after I just spent last night binging the ssc YouTube channel. Look at you. You use Statmes every day and you like SST.

02:56:32
<transcript>: That's in data.

02:56:36
thdxr: this guy is our #1 fan

02:56:37
<transcript>: Dax, we might have to have them on the podcast. I feel like this is too coincidental.

02:56:37
<transcript>: that he

02:56:41
<transcript>: That he was like he was following us around without even knowing it.

02:56:49
<transcript>: He's our number one fan. I think so. That's in data you might be a number one fan.

02:56:55
<transcript>: I don't know how high that bar is. Probably not very. But you might be it.

02:56:55
glamshatterskull: top 10 reasons to not use sst

02:56:56
<transcript>: Okay.

02:56:56
<transcript>: i

02:56:59
statsndata: I promise this is the most coincidental stream of all time

02:56:59
coolpantstv: @adamdotdev @thdxr how much are you guys paying this @statsndata guy

02:57:00
<transcript>: I don't love the way it's doing this with this.

02:57:00
<transcript>: i think

02:57:02
<transcript>: I think I can get the details.

02:57:02
<transcript>: elsewhere

02:57:03
<transcript>: Elsewhere.

02:57:03
<transcript>: i think

02:57:11
<transcript>: I think I have most of it right down here. So, like this type right here. This is the it's one type of.

02:57:11
<transcript>: the thing

02:57:12
<transcript>: The thing.

02:57:14
<transcript>: So like let's do this.

02:57:17
<transcript>: In detail.

02:57:17
<transcript>: get out of here

02:57:20
<transcript>: Get out of here. Player Details Scoring summary.

02:57:25
<transcript>: Disclaimers Summary tokens we know what those are.

02:57:25
<transcript>: those my

02:57:27
<transcript>: Those My friends.

02:57:28
<transcript>: Those.

02:57:28
<transcript>: are

02:57:30
<transcript>: Are tokens.

02:57:34
<transcript>: Do that sometimes.

02:57:34
<transcript>: i write it like that

02:57:40
<transcript>: I write it like that. And sometimes I read it like that. I bet there's like an actual functional difference that I just did not know it. That'd be funny.

02:57:46
<transcript>: These are additional questions which I'll change in a SEC.

02:57:46
<transcript>: conversation

02:57:51
fragaverage: is SST an acronym for something?

02:57:52
<transcript>: Conversation and then disposition. But Where's the type? I know for a fact. This thing should have a type on it.

02:57:52
<transcript>: the detail

02:57:54
<transcript>: The detail should.

02:57:54
<transcript>: oh

02:57:58
<transcript>: Oh, oh, that's out there. So this right here. This.

02:57:58
<transcript>: should

02:58:02
<transcript>: Should have a tight. Where is it? It's not on there.

02:58:14
<transcript>: How much are you guys paying this test? That's funny. That's funny. Cool pants. I promise. This is the most coincidental stream of all time. That's so crazy.

02:58:26
<transcript>: That's really funny to me.

02:58:29
<transcript>: I don't know why that's so funny to me.

02:58:29
<transcript>: some server

02:58:33
<transcript>: Some serverless tech. Yeah, let's do this wrong answers only. What is ssd stand for.

02:58:37
<transcript>: I'm gonna yank this whole thing.

02:58:37
<transcript>: and

02:58:46
<transcript>: And then I'm gonna go up here, and we're gonna we're gonna do our first detail type. Okay. So exports interface. Thank you so much. Follow Naruka.

02:58:48
thdxr: @GlamShatterskull some serverless thing

02:58:54
thdxr: this is now officially what it is

02:58:56
livemahs: some smelly toots

02:58:58
mafiaee: Super Simple Task

02:58:59
glamshatterskull: i think it works

02:59:00
<transcript>: Interface. And we're gonna call this one a game result. I think detail, we'll change that. It's probably not right. And then I'm gonna paste that in there like that. Okay. Now we're gonna go through and fix this.

02:59:02
<transcript>: Gamera entity.

02:59:06
glamshatterskull: @thdxr it fits no?

02:59:09
<transcript>: Earlier I saw into the and thought that was right, but is it gamera entity? What is that entity.

02:59:12
<transcript>: What is that entity.

02:59:12
<transcript>: oh no

02:59:15
<transcript>: Oh, no. What is that.

02:59:16
mattmancodes: Sailors Sipping Tea

02:59:17
<transcript>: Oh no.

02:59:23
thdxr: gonna tweet this

02:59:24
<transcript>: I think that should be gamera entity.

02:59:27
<transcript>: That's unfortunate.

02:59:27
<transcript>: now

02:59:30
<transcript>: Now I question all of this.

02:59:33
<transcript>: App should also.

02:59:36
glamshatterskull: i will toot

02:59:36
<transcript>: Be.

02:59:38
glamshatterskull: LUL

02:59:41
<transcript>: Oh, feels bad.

02:59:41
<transcript>: okay

02:59:46
<transcript>: Okay gamera entity. So here is a game result detail. Let's see.

02:59:52
<transcript>: What? Welcome to Chat mafia.

02:59:52
<transcript>: super simple

02:59:54
<transcript>: Super simple task.

02:59:55
<transcript>: Smelly.

03:00:01
<transcript>: Some serverless thing. This is now officially what it is. That's so funny.

03:00:05
<transcript>: Okay.

03:00:06
<transcript>: The.

03:00:11
<transcript>: Swagger UI here. I think this shows me all the different types.

03:00:13
<transcript>: Where does it do that.

03:00:13
<transcript>: in the

03:00:15
<transcript>: In the schema.

03:00:17
narukaniku: What advice would you give to a person who has a web app idea but no programming skills. Hire a freelancer or learn to code, If looking for a freelancer what to search for (No IT previous experience)

03:00:18
<transcript>: Where am I looking.

03:00:21
<transcript>: So cancel. I don't want to do that.

03:00:21
<transcript>: i just

03:00:24
<transcript>: I just want to see the schema.

03:00:27
<transcript>: Well, here we go. Here we go.

03:00:29
<transcript>: So.

03:00:29
<transcript>: answer

03:00:32
<transcript>: Answer, no answer. Visual.

03:00:32
<transcript>: has

03:00:34
<transcript>: Has a.

03:00:39
<transcript>: Detail. And this is an answer. Visual detail, which could be.

03:00:39
<transcript>: anyone

03:00:41
<transcript>: Anyone of the following.

03:00:46
<transcript>: Game, odds. And these things. This is what these could do.

03:00:50
<transcript>: Okay.

03:01:05
<transcript>: What advice? Welcome to Chattanoruka. What advice would you give to a person who has a wedding idea, but no programming skills. Hire a freelancer or learn to code if looking for a freelancer, what to search for no. It previous experience.

03:01:11
<transcript>: So do you. Do you have experience.

03:01:17
<transcript>: Doing anything on computers. This is my first question.

03:01:21
<transcript>: I'm terrible at advice. Just so you know, my chat is very good at it.

03:01:21
<transcript>: someone in ch

03:01:22
0xcouch: @narukaniku Hire someone on upwork

03:01:24
narukaniku: No

03:01:30
<transcript>: Someone in Chat will probably give you very good advice. I'm gonna try. I'm gonna try really hard, but I'm not very good at it. Whoa. Thank you so much, Greg. For the Prime Minister.

03:01:30
code_stank: Do you have microsoft word experience? You can export the document to HTML and post that

03:01:32
glamshatterskull: doesn't zapier make ads for this exact person?

03:01:33
<transcript>: I appreciate your prime sub.

03:01:46
mattmancodes: @code_stank was waiting for that

03:01:46
<transcript>: So much. Okay, no experience, mate. And doing anything on a computer. Okay, hire someone upwork. Let's couch advice. Do you have my Microsoft Word experience? You can export the document to html and post that. Wait, what.

03:01:48
livemahs: chatgpt

03:01:50
livemahs: lol

03:01:50
<transcript>: Where's that to me or to the Roku.

03:01:54
<transcript>: Ja GBD what is going on.

03:01:54
<transcript>: oh you have

03:01:57
<transcript>: Oh, you have chat gbz magnet. That's a good idea.

03:02:02
<transcript>: Doesn't zapier make ads for this exact person.

03:02:05
<transcript>: Zapier make ads.

03:02:08
<transcript>: I feel like my brain has shut up.

03:02:08
<transcript>: i can't

03:02:11
<transcript>: I can't understand any of your sentence as people.

03:02:13
binajmen: I would try to connect in a tech community in your area, or visit a coworking space.

03:02:17
livemahs: chatgpt is actually helping me learn typescript with a project, it's helpful for sure

03:02:17
mattmancodes: Webflow too

03:02:17
code_stank: @code_stank dreamweaver is for senior developers

03:02:21
meranofox: @narukaniku Learning to code is not a casual thing if you want to build something production grade to consider if you have that commitment

03:02:23
<transcript>: I would try to connect in a tech community in your area or visit a coworking space. So here's what? Here's my question. Here's my question for you.

03:02:35
glamshatterskull: zapier commercials. aren't they like "i made an app and i don't know how to code"

03:02:38
meranofox: getting a freelancer is only an option if you have money to spend

03:02:40
<transcript>: My question for you, naruka. And I want to say this. I don't want to be like abrasive. I'm not an abrasive person, but I want to give you the I want to give you what I really think I'm gonna give you my from my gut, honest answer.

03:02:40
<transcript>: and i

03:02:51
<transcript>: And I don't have very much contacts so you can throw away whatever I say. Just forget about it. But I think my question would be it's not even to say I'm not gonna say something. I'm gonna ask you a question. My next question would be.

03:02:57
mattmancodes: lots of dramatic camera action

03:03:00
<transcript>: What so a lot of people I get so many people in my career have come to me because they know I do by program, and they've come to me and say.

03:03:03
<transcript>: Could you build this thing? I had this idea for an app.

03:03:04
meranofox: and most likely you would need a UX designer too, not just a programmer. Tip: programmers suck at design

03:03:06
<transcript>: And I think my question would be.

03:03:08
snowfoundry: !discord

03:03:08
fossabot: Adam has a Discord server and he'd love to see you there: https://discord.gg/E92M2chd3e

03:03:18
<transcript>: Well, I guess you're saying you want to hire them. I'm thinking through this again. What I was gonna say is if it's like you want to do this with them.

03:03:18
<transcript>: then my question is

03:03:22
<transcript>: Then my question is generally like, what is it you think.

03:03:24
ayushsharma: it zoom is very comedic

03:03:26
glamshatterskull: but tailwind tells us how to design @MeranoFox LUL

03:03:31
code_stank: @MeranoFox had an onsite where a room of engineers tried to solve a design issue. It was horrible. The PM was scared at the end

03:03:32
<transcript>: You will be able to like, do you think you'd be a really good like operator of this business? You want to make it and then operate it. You just can't build it or.

03:03:32
<transcript>: do you know what

03:03:37
<transcript>: Do you know what you're signing up for? I'm struggling here. I'm struggling with words, but.

03:03:44
<transcript>: I think a lot of people have ideas. And then if they don't really feel like they would be good to, like, run that thing.

03:03:44
<transcript>: once it is

03:03:46
<transcript>: Once it is built.

03:03:46
<transcript>: then

03:03:49
meranofox: NotLikeThis

03:03:59
<transcript>: Then I would run. I would turn and run. Startups are hard, and I'm not trying to gate keep it's just like it's a big investment of your life to build something. And also I would say, if you're hiring somebody and you have somebody build something for you.

03:03:59
<transcript>: it

03:04:06
<transcript>: It never stops. You never stop building the thing. You're always building the thing. So I would say, Learn to code. That's my answer.

03:04:06
<transcript>: that was terrible

03:04:08
gregkedzierski: Just got my first AWS cert, how many do you feel I should get to start looking for AWS IQ contracts and have a good chance of getting them?

03:04:12
<transcript>: That was terrible. I'm sorry. I would say learn to code because you can't just hire somebody on upwork.

03:04:12
<transcript>: and then every

03:04:18
<transcript>: And then every time something needs to change, which is literally every single day when you're building some new thing.

03:04:18
<transcript>: you're gonna have to

03:04:19
narukaniku: Thank you for the insight :)

03:04:21
spartangtr: or have chatGPT write it?

03:04:22
<transcript>: You're gonna have to bring somebody else in. I would just learn. I would learn how to do it.

03:04:28
<transcript>: Otherwise, you better be really good at like everything else involved with the startup.

03:04:36
<transcript>: And then convince somebody to join you and like COFAN it with you. So if you're not technical and you want to build a software business.

03:04:36
<transcript>: i would

03:04:38
<transcript>: I would say.

03:04:38
<transcript>: either

03:04:49
twitchmarketer: Yep.

03:04:53
<transcript>: Either be so good at everything else that you know, you can raise money and you know, you can keep the thing going and sell people on the vision, do all the nontechnical stuff really well and then just sell somebody sell some technical person on joining you to build this thing and do it together.

03:04:53
<transcript>: either that

03:04:54
meranofox: just buy this template and launch immediately https://tailwindui.com/templates

03:04:58
<transcript>: Either that or just get technical. Learn how to code. That's my advice. Okay.

03:05:00
<transcript>: I'm gonna come over here because.

03:05:00
<transcript>: tab script

03:05:04
<transcript>: Tab script makes me sad makes me so sad.

03:05:10
<transcript>: Let's see, learning to code is not a casual thing. Oh, I'm catching up. Why you guys got really talking of now.

03:05:10
<transcript>: chat

03:05:16
<transcript>: Chat gbc is actually helping me learn Thai scripts with a project. It's helpful for sure. Chat gpt is super helpful.

03:05:16
<transcript>: i think you

03:05:28
<transcript>: I think you could build entire apps with chat GBD with enough back and forth. I don't know if you'd have to already be technical. I can't step out side of my technical brain to think about how I would do it if I didn't know any of this stuff. Webflow.

03:05:34
livemahs: or be like levels fyi and build it out with low code tools

03:05:35
<transcript>: Dreamweavers for senior developers, learning to code is not a casual thing. If you want to build something production grade to consider.

03:05:35
<transcript>: if you have

03:05:47
<transcript>: If you have that commitment zapier commercials counterarguments that moreno is. I don't know what production grade is, but the first version is Sam use was pretty bad. I mean, it sucks.

03:05:56
<transcript>: But we built it. I mean, like, it worked, and we got a lot of traction off a pretty crappy piece of technology.

03:06:00
<transcript>: We raised $10 million off a pretty awful.

03:06:00
<transcript>: project

03:06:05
<transcript>: Project. I mean like code base. It was a pretty awful code base, I guess.

03:06:05
<transcript>: so production

03:06:10
<transcript>: So production grade. I don't know. Like I don't know if you have to build something production graph to build a startup.

03:06:16
<transcript>: But yeah, no, I mean, software development is like a big.

03:06:16
<transcript>: time commitment

03:06:19
<transcript>: Time commitment to learn how to do all this stuff.

03:06:21
<transcript>: It's worth it, though I think.

03:06:30
<transcript>: Getting a freelancer is only an option if you have money to spend lots of dramatic camera action. Was it zooming in on my face and stuff.

03:06:31
binajmen: Yeah basically if your MVP is crispy clean, it means you put too much effort in it

03:06:36
<transcript>: Like that.

03:06:42
<transcript>: I have a stupid thing that I made. That whenever I make a big face, it'll Zoom in on me. It's very dramatic.

03:06:50
<transcript>: Most likely you would need a ux designer to not just a programmer. Tip. Programmers suck at design. Ouch, moreno. Ouch.

03:06:54
<transcript>: Thank you for that. Follow. Ama. Here. Mather, BAHER.

03:06:58
<transcript>: Now I agree programmers do generally second design.

03:07:01
snowfoundry: Whats the link to the face zoomer

03:07:01
<transcript>: Discord. Yeah, I do have a discord.

03:07:01
<transcript>: the zoom

03:07:07
<transcript>: The Zoom is very comedic good. That was the idea. Tailwind tells us how to design.

03:07:13
<transcript>: Had an onsite we're. A room of engineers tried to solve a design issue. It was horrible. The PM scares did.

03:07:15
<transcript>: Chat, Greg.

03:07:15
<transcript>: just got my

03:07:24
<transcript>: Just got my first aws, cert, how many do you feel? I should get to start looking at it for a Tobis iq contracts and have a good chance of getting them.

03:07:24
<transcript>: so

03:07:27
<transcript>: So that's a question I know a lot of.

03:07:30
<transcript>: Times I know a lot about.

03:07:30
<transcript>: so

03:07:37
narukaniku: Learning takes some time, Can I consider say learning Back end and hire a Free lancer for front end?

03:07:40
a_maher938: so what stage you will go through to gget a MVP

03:07:41
<transcript>: So I did AWS iq for maybe like eight months, pretty heavy before I just started kind of working a lot off of iq, and I didn't really need to be on iq much, but.

03:07:41
<transcript>: iq

03:07:43
<transcript>: Iq.

03:07:43
<transcript>: is this

03:07:51
<transcript>: Is this marketplace for freelance work, but specifically people who know a lot about aws. And then we do work for people in their aws accounts.

03:07:51
a_maher938: stages*

03:07:59
<transcript>: And if you have a lot of certs, you're you're gonna get a lot of work on aws iq because people just see your name and they see the numbers.

03:07:59
<transcript>: and people

03:08:04
<transcript>: And people choose you based on that often well that and being able to get on phone call and be kind.

03:08:20
<transcript>: With like one cert, you could get lucky and people could choose you or they could say they want you on a phone call. And if you can carry it from there and you can have a good conversation on the phone.

03:08:22
glamshatterskull: have you done aws iq before?

03:08:31
<transcript>: That's great. If you had, like, four or five, you're gonna probably stand out and you're gonna get more phone calls because not a lot of people on there. I think the sweet spot is like three. You see a lot of people.

03:08:31
<transcript>: back when i was doing

03:08:35
<transcript>: Back when I was doing it two years ago, a year and a half ago, whatever.

03:08:35
<transcript>: you see

03:08:42
glamshatterskull: ah yes you have

03:08:44
<transcript>: You see a lot of people with like, three certs, but once you get into like, four, five, six, I think then you'll start to stand out. People will choose you just because you have more certs than other people.

03:08:55
<transcript>: You're welcome to ruca. I don't know if my inside was good. I was tipped on a rack, so I didn't want to sound like gatekeeping cause I don't even know what gatekeeping is, but I genuinely.

03:08:55
<transcript>: honestly

03:08:56
<transcript>: Honestly.

03:09:05
<transcript>: Affirm belief of mine is that anybody can do anything they want. If you want to do it, you can go ahead and do it. I think anybody can go be a programmer. Half of it is can you set and find.

03:09:09
<transcript>: A desk for a long time. Clearly, I can't.

03:09:12
meranofox: Are the certs just a business model or did you feel they were truly valuable in terms of knowledge?

03:09:20
<transcript>: It's not been a lot of focusing going on since I started streaming again, but I think anybody that wants to be a programmer go do it. And if you want to do it and you keep doing it because you enjoy it.

03:09:20
<transcript>: you'll be

03:09:26
<transcript>: You'll be a programmer like I don't think anybody couldn't be if they really want to be.

03:09:26
<transcript>: i know

03:09:37
<transcript>: I know that's like very cliche. And it's like anybody can be a basketball player even if you're five foot two. And just like, try really hard. I don't know if that's all true, but I do genuinely especially in the.

03:09:37
<transcript>: knowledge work

03:09:53
spartangtr: ugh, but this whole cert thin g is just the next iteration in a cycle, first it was MCSE, then it was CCIE. AWS is the new microsoft/vmware. i really wish the industry could get away from vendor specific cert jockey kinda stuff

03:09:57
thdxr: it's hard and anyone can figure it out!

03:09:57
<transcript>: Knowledge worker fields. I think anybody can do anything they want. So I don't have any ounce of me that thinks it's some special brain you have to have like, I know my own brain. And I know if I can do this stuff, anybody can do it. But it does take a lot of time and effort. It's hard work. And if you do all that hard work, you will become it. And so you better really want to become it because you got to do a lot of work.

03:09:57
<transcript>: to get there

03:09:58
binajmen: @a_maher938 If I had to build a new product, I would create a "wireframe like" experience. One path through the tool, only to prove your point on 2/3 scenarios. If you get traction, then start to build more seriously the features.

03:09:58
<transcript>: To get there.

03:09:58
<transcript>: and that's just

03:10:05
<transcript>: And that's just like anything. It's not unique to programming. First time chat. Welcome to Chat. Twitch marketer. Yep.

03:10:05
<transcript>: yep

03:10:06
<transcript>: Yep.

03:10:08
lilchavy: I'm going to start the Meta front end cert on Coursera this week. Have you heard any good feedback from that site??

03:10:16
<transcript>: Just buy this template and launch immediately. Tailwind ui templates oh templates are great. I love those tail window. I templates although I will say.

03:10:16
<transcript>: as great as

03:10:21
<transcript>: As great as tailwind is, and as much as I admire Adam Wave wazen Waven.

03:10:37
<transcript>: There were some things in the template that we're not optimized. I was a little surprised. I just thought it would be, like, pristine, but there was like some stuff where it was like, oh, okay. The font files are like completely giant. Like, one meg. Font files don't shift those to production.

03:10:37
<transcript>: there's some

03:10:39
<transcript>: There's some little things like that. But.

03:10:42
<transcript>: Or be like levels FYI.

03:10:42
<transcript>: and build it out

03:10:44
<transcript>: And build it out with low code tools so that.

03:10:44
<transcript>: there's

03:10:46
<transcript>: There's a whole community, people.

03:10:46
<transcript>: that are building

03:10:49
<transcript>: That are building with these tools.

03:10:49
<transcript>: the no code

03:10:51
<transcript>: The no Code and Low Code tools.

03:10:53
<transcript>: There's the indie hacker.

03:11:13
<transcript>: All this stuff. Basically, if your MVP is crispyclean, it means you put too much effort in it. What's the link to the face? Zoomer Snowflake Andre, it is in my dot file or in my overlays, I guess on github. Well, I haven't actually pushed this code. I just wrote it. I just. I wrote it. I used a little open source model that does facial expression detection.

03:11:13
<transcript>: and

03:11:19
<transcript>: And I wrote a little dumb algorithm that like if it's over certain threshold, that certain expressions.

03:11:19
<transcript>: then it zooms

03:11:21
glamshatterskull: @spartangtr agree with this... it feels annoying. especaially when you have so much experience

03:11:29
<transcript>: Then it zooms in on me, and I just have a separate scene in obs or not seen. Just a separate source. That it toggles visibility on. That's all it is. It's homegrown.

03:11:29
<transcript>: i made it

03:11:37
<transcript>: I made it so that when I'm really happy, it doesn't Zoom in on me because I get happy a lot and I didn't want it to Zoom in. But if I'm really surprised.

03:11:40
<transcript>: It'll Zoom in or if I'm really angry.

03:11:40
<transcript>: like

03:11:45
a_maher938: @binajmen  traction from who exactly !

03:11:48
<transcript>: Like this stupid code. It'll Zoom in on me for dramatic effect. If I'm really surprised, I know I already surprised if I'm really sad.

03:11:51
<transcript>: It should do it. Yeah. Okay.

03:11:53
<transcript>: That's what it is.

03:11:57
spartangtr: right. yuou could be a total "rockstar" for lack of better words and not even get looked at because you dont have certs. it's just vendor bullshit

03:11:58
<transcript>: Learning takes some time. Can I consider saying.

03:11:58
<transcript>: can i consider

03:12:07
<transcript>: Can I consider say learning back and in back in sorry. Can I consider say learning backend and hire a freelancer for frontend.

03:12:07
<transcript>: possibly

03:12:11
<transcript>: Possibly sorry that took me a bit. I had to the capitalization threw me off a little bit.

03:12:16
<transcript>: Could you consider learning back in and hire a freelancer for frontend.

03:12:27
binajmen: @a_maher938 the first customers you target. sell before build

03:12:33
<transcript>: Honestly, that might be harder than one of the other two options that I laid out there. I think it'd be easier to just either sell somebody on being a technical cofounder or just learn how to do it all. If you're trying to, like, hire somebody just to do the front end, that's gonna be a really hard for you learning the back end. Probably.

03:12:38
<transcript>: Just like working with other people's hard. It's a whole nother skill when it comes to programming.

03:12:42
thdxr: imo you should just learn to do everything, at SST we all do everything and things are way smoother. way less "company" crap that comes with overhead

03:12:45
<transcript>: So what stage you will go through to get a MVP? Welcome to chat.

03:12:47
<transcript>: Amen here.

03:12:47
<transcript>: what stages

03:12:49
<transcript>: What stages.

03:12:52
<transcript>: Will you go through to get an MVP.

03:12:52
<transcript>: thank you for

03:12:55
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow. Eagle seven.

03:12:57
thdxr: don't need to write a spec to hand over to an engineer, etc

03:12:59
<transcript>: What stages we go through to get to an MVP.

03:12:59
<transcript>: i don't really

03:13:02
<transcript>: I don't really think about stages. I don't know.

03:13:02
<transcript>: i'm

03:13:05
<transcript>: I'm just kind of loosey goosey with this stuff.

03:13:09
<transcript>: I don't really have stages in mind.

03:13:23
<transcript>: Glam. Have you done a tobacu for yes, I have are you are the search just a business model? Or did you really or did you feel they were truly valuable in terms of knowledge? I definitely learned a lot. I will say ABS search skew heavily.

03:13:29
<transcript>: Away from serverless, and I mostly build everything with serverless technologies. So in that sense.

03:13:34
thdxr: same for when me and adam work together, we can just jump in anywhere

03:13:41
<transcript>: Iq is not as useful for helping me build stuff I actually build. It was useful in like learning a lot of obscure other legacy type services on aws. They're not legacy, but like traditional.

03:13:41
<transcript>: like

03:13:51
<transcript>: Like vms and vpcs and all that really complicated network architectures. I learned a lot of stuff like that that I would not have learned otherwise. So yeah, I guess I learned I don't really use that knowledge.

03:13:58
<transcript>: I did a few like projects for clients where I had to know some of that stuff, but it was pretty rare.

03:13:58
e4gle7: What aws certs would you recommend for a developer?

03:14:07
glamshatterskull: sounds like a dream @thdxr

03:14:16
<transcript>: Ug with this whole cert thing is just the next iteration in a site. First it was mcse, then it was ccie. This is the new Microsoft vmware. I really wish the industry could get away from vinegar specific search document kind of stuff. Honestly, spartan, I don't know how much asserts matter in the real world. Like, I don't know how much. I don't know how much they really.

03:14:16
<transcript>: affect

03:14:28
<transcript>: Affect us outside of that cert world. Like if you don't care about them, I think you can have a perfectly fine career and never care about certs. Dax doesn't care about certs. He's doing great.

03:14:40
jammontoast: I don't care about certs, no one does at my company

03:14:43
<transcript>: It's hard. And anyone configured out. Thank you, dax. That's the words programming's. Hard. Learning this stuff. It's hard. Can take a lot of hard work, but anyone can do it. Anyone can figure it out. Anyone is capable if you want to.

03:14:54
<transcript>: If I had to build a new product, I would create a wireframe like experience one path through the tool, only to prove your point on two to three scenarios. If you get traction, start to build more seriously the features. So I will say, Benjamin, I love the.

03:14:54
<transcript>: one way my mind

03:15:00
<transcript>: One way, my mind works really well is the. Like, what do they call it? Harpoon, steel, harpoon. Or steel thread.

03:15:00
<transcript>: a steel thread

03:15:03
<transcript>: A steel thread where you like, build.

03:15:03
<transcript>: time

03:15:08
<transcript>: Time altogether from like from the furthest reaches of the product so like make sure.

03:15:08
<transcript>: go shall

03:15:22
<transcript>: Go shallow, but, like, hit all the things. So make sure you got a back in in a database in the front end. And like, where you can see the whole thing come together and then start, like, putting meat on that bones. I like to build this way. Like, I like to kind of like.

03:15:22
<transcript>: just get

03:15:25
a_maher938: @a_maher938 IDK man how can i achieve that, i need more info can you provide me a resource or something or can i send u a msg

03:15:28
binajmen: exactly

03:15:30
<transcript>: Just get a connective tissue that runs all the way through the project and touch all the layers. And then once I've got that I can start kind of like making everything.

03:15:30
<transcript>: better on top

03:15:32
<transcript>: Better on top of that if that makes sense.

03:15:39
binajmen: you had better words to explain it ^^

03:15:52
<transcript>: You just said you would create a wireframe like experience, one path through the tool that just made me think of that. I don't know if that's really what you meant. First time chat. Welcome to Chat lil chevy. I'm going to start the meta front insert on Coursera this week. Have you heard any good feedback from that site? I really haven't. I mean, I haven't heard bad feedback. I just had heard much feedback on Coursera. Most of the feedback.

03:15:52
<transcript>: i hear

03:15:54
<transcript>: I hear on courses.

03:15:54
<transcript>: are that people

03:15:58
<transcript>: Are that people buy a lot of them and they don't take them. So if you actually take it.

03:15:58
<transcript>: it probably

03:16:08
<transcript>: It probably be good for you. I know tomo, from 30 Seconds to Mars, he's got really inner programming, and he's taking some courses, and it might have been corsair. No, I don't think so.

03:16:12
a_maher938: tutorial hell

03:16:14
<transcript>: He had good things to say about the course of he took and I can't remember where they were. I don't think they were. Of course, there, though.

03:16:20
<transcript>: Let's see agree with this is feels annoying especially when you have so much experience.

03:16:29
narukaniku: For a beginner Udemy is good - Or would you recommend anything else?

03:16:31
glamshatterskull: coursera has lots of "official" sources for their stuff... i like them.

03:16:36
<transcript>: Okay, right. You could be a total rock star for lack of better words and not even get looked at because you don't have certs. It's just vendor bullshit. So I don't know. Are there employers that really care about certs? I hadn't seen that. But maybe.

03:16:39
jammontoast: I have a friend that does 5G network consultation work, certs are important in that.

03:16:41
<transcript>: Oh, am I Confused? Is that why it zoomed in on.

03:16:52
mattmancodes: I have certs, no one ever asks about them

03:16:52
<transcript>: In my opinion, just learned you everything and SSC we do. We all do everything. And things are way smoother, way less company crap that comes with over at yeah, yeah. Don't need to write a spec to head over to an engineer. Exactly.

03:16:52
<transcript>: same from

03:17:01
<transcript>: Same from with Me or Win me an Adam work can work together. We just jump in anywhere. Exactly. It's way more fun when there are no walls, no boundaries.

03:17:01
<transcript>: no like

03:17:07
<transcript>: No like responsibilities. Just like anybody can do anything.

03:17:11
narukaniku: Or go for a local institute in area instead of online?

03:17:25
<transcript>: Okay. I don't care about search. No one does my company. I think most companies don't care. Definitely not in the startup realm. Maybe there's some big companies I think actually. Aws. Like when they hire people, I think they are actually care that their employees get their own certs. So I know that a Tobis employees really care about turts. I just I think outside of.

03:17:25
<transcript>: i think that

03:17:29
glamshatterskull: i am looking for work right now and i've been asked several times for certs

03:17:33
<transcript>: I think that's the exception. I think the biggest companies that care about certs are the exception. I think most small domain size companies don't.

03:17:35
cowfacedude99: I have certs. but I don't use them for my work LUL

03:17:38
<transcript>: I don't have a lot to stand on when I say that, but that's my feeling.

03:17:40
binajmen: @a_maher938 I think the best is to read books, and also try and fail ;)

03:17:50
<transcript>: Tutorial hell for a beginner. Yudemi is good. Or would you recommend anything else? I know. I've heard a lot about people buying stuff on you. To me, I haven't heard a lot about the courses.

03:17:50
<transcript>: front

03:17:54
meranofox: @narukaniku I have a gist for you

03:17:54
<transcript>: Frontend Masters so if you want to learn how computers actually work.

03:17:54
<transcript>: prime

03:17:55
gregkedzierski: You need certs if you have specific reasons. 1. To stand out on AWS IQ. 2. To prove your skills for some US visas.

03:17:55
meranofox: one sec

03:18:06
<transcript>: Prime dsa course. I actually took on frontend Masters. My surprise you to know I didn't actually know anything about computers. I've been a software Dev for 15 years. I knew nothing about how software.

03:18:06
<transcript>: fundamentally

03:18:16
kaloome: Hey from France !

03:18:18
cowfacedude99: FEM has some nice ones. but it is way too expensive for me

03:18:24
<transcript>: Fundamentally works. And all the algorithms that make up like, I just want to sort. You know, I'm in javascript. I'm like, I want to do sort on my array and get a sorted array. I didn't know there's, like, all kinds of cool stuff involved with the algorithms. So I took a dsa course. Fantastic. It's free. Frontend Masters has his dsa course.

03:18:24
<transcript>: for free

03:18:25
spartangtr: there are companies out there that will filter resumes based on certs, but they're generally not the most desirable places to work anyway. but more importantly, AWS offers discounts(just like cisco/microsoft/etc) based on the number of certified folks you ahve on staff, and you get cloud bill discounts. they incentivize companies to hire certified people or make current employees get certified

03:18:30
<transcript>: For free for anyone just sign up on frontend Masters you can take the course you'll learn a whole lot.

03:18:30
<transcript>: about

03:18:32
<transcript>: About the fundamentals.

03:18:34
<transcript>: Of programming.

03:18:34
<transcript>: and

03:18:37
otifex: I get the feeling that if you want to become independant and work as contractor it can help.  it'd like to work like that more but never cared about certs

03:18:37
daglee: I have a Cert for sewing machine from school.  Nobody every asks about it. :(

03:18:38
<transcript>: And it just helps you kind of think about.

03:18:38
<transcript>: oh

03:18:43
<transcript>: Oh like people actually understand how stuff is like allocated in memory.

03:18:43
<transcript>: i

03:18:51
<transcript>: college

03:18:51
<transcript>: I was not a developer that had any of that knowledge, but now I have some primes and excellent teacher as well. I wish you were my.

03:18:54
<transcript>: College professor. I would have probably stayed in College.

03:18:54
<transcript>: little savvy

03:19:00
<transcript>: Little savvy. Thanks for that follow. Also zack, in and columb. Thank you for those follows.

03:19:03
<transcript>: I have a friend.

03:19:03
<transcript>: let's see course

03:19:18
<transcript>: Let's see. Coursera has lots of official sources for their stuff. I like them. I have a friend that does 5g network consultation work. Certs are important in that. Yeah. I'm sure there's some industries where they are very important, but like I mostly hang out in the sas and like software.

03:19:18
<transcript>: startup

03:19:24
mattmancodes: Just say you have the certs. They never ask to see them but your milage may vary and never take advice from Twitch chat.

03:19:28
jammontoast: Same, I work in SaaS / start ups

03:19:29
<transcript>: Startup realm. In that realm, they definitely don't matter. Nobody is in interviewing like, no founders are interviewing potential engineering hires and being like, Sorry, you didn't have a cert.

03:19:34
thdxr: I'm not hiring anyone unless they have 12 certs

03:19:35
<transcript>: Yeah. Matt. You have searched known to rasp at him? Yeah. I think they're hit or miss.

03:19:35
<transcript>: or

03:19:39
<transcript>: Or go for a local Institute in area instead of online.

03:19:39
<transcript>: yeah i think some

03:19:44
<transcript>: Yeah. I think some people probably learned better when they're in a like physical classroom setting.

03:19:44
<transcript>: i'm sure that's

03:19:47
<transcript>: I'm sure that's a thing I know everybody has different learning styles.

03:19:56
a_maher938: i have no cert's but i sure can build stuff

03:19:59
<transcript>: I'm looking for work right now and I've been asked several times for shirts. Really glad. Okay, this is good to get all these data points. Calf a test certs. But I don't use them for my work. What do you use in four cafes? Just for learning? Like forced learning.

03:20:05
e4gle7: What aws certs would you recommend for a developer?

03:20:06
<transcript>: If you have specific reasons, one to stand out on.

03:20:11
<transcript>: Two. To prove your skills for some US visas. Oh, visas. Okay.

03:20:11
<transcript>: okay

03:20:12
<transcript>: Okay.

03:20:12
<transcript>: colum

03:20:14
glamshatterskull: i have certs in sandwich making @thdxr my italian sub will blow thy mind

03:20:15
<transcript>: Columb. Hello, from America.

03:20:15
<transcript>: you're in france

03:20:20
<transcript>: You're in France. I'm in America. It's so cool that we can be connected over the internet.

03:20:22
<transcript>: The Wonders of technology.

03:20:22
<transcript>: phim

03:20:31
<transcript>: Phim has some nice ones, but it is way too expensive. Right. Okay. There are companies out there that filter as means based on sorts of generally not the most desirable ways we're gonna, but more important.

03:20:31
<transcript>: aws are

03:20:35
thdxr: @GlamShatterskull tbh would love that right now

03:20:41
<transcript>: Aws are to discount just like cisco, the number of certified folks you have on set. Oh yeah, that's true. If you're like a partner, like an avias partner, there's reasons that you need to get certs, that kind of thing.

03:21:01
livemahs: @GlamShatterskull i've got a subway university degree, we'll go to war

03:21:01
<transcript>: It's a feeling if you want to become independent and work as a contractor, it can help. I like, yeah, I think independent. It's more valuable than, like trying to get a traditional job. I think, like on an application, it's probably less important at least in software engineering roles, than it is. If you're an independent, you want to just prove you've got some expertise. Thank you for the following Jpmada mat.

03:21:01
<transcript>: mattias

03:21:03
<transcript>: Mattias.

03:21:03
<transcript>: dagli

03:21:05
glamshatterskull: job hunting right now feels really dire and disconnected to be honest.

03:21:08
<transcript>: Daglin, I have a cert for sewing machine from school. Whoa, nobody ever asked about it. I wonder why.

03:21:08
<transcript>: how

03:21:10
<transcript>: How would that come up.

03:21:10
<transcript>: hey

03:21:13
<transcript>: Hey, dagley, do you have any certs.

03:21:13
<transcript>: no not

03:21:14
narukaniku: Thank you for the insight, Lurrv from India God bless. Keep up the good work. Best channel I have come across for honest insights.

03:21:17
glamshatterskull: but that could be me LUL

03:21:20
<transcript>: No, not text Arts. I'm thinking more like homec. Do you have any home excerpts? That's like the only way it would ever come up. And I don't think that would ever happen.

03:21:29
<transcript>: Just say you have the certs. They never asked to see them. But your mouth be fairy. That sounds a little a little dicey. You could get called out.

03:21:29
<transcript>: same i

03:21:36
<transcript>: Same. I work in sas startups. Okay, I'm not hiring anyone else. They have twelve certs. Ooh. Does that mean I have a job? Decks.

03:21:42
<transcript>: I have no certs, but I'm sure I sure can't build stuff. That's what matters. What it is. Search. Would you recommend for a developer.

03:21:48
<transcript>: Well, I don't know. I feel like I've spent the last ten minutes saying, Search don't matter.

03:21:48
<transcript>: so it

03:21:56
<transcript>: So it feels weird and disingenuous to be like, but you should take this one. I think if you want certs, you have reasons and you're a developer.

03:21:56
<transcript>: they do have

03:21:57
glamshatterskull: there is a aws developer cert

03:22:09
cowfacedude99: my certs are in GCP devops line and I write old school expressjs+handlebar html sites for work. so my certs don't relate to my work at all. LUL

03:22:11
glamshatterskull: it's called developer

03:22:12
<transcript>: They do have the whole developer line like the aws developer associator. Whatever. That's a good one that you'll probably just knock out of the park because it has questions about git like questions that if you are developer, you're just gonna know the answer to even if you didn't study. But then there's also a bunch of aws stuff you'll have to learn.

03:22:16
<transcript>: So I would start with the A to Best Developer associate and then.

03:22:16
<transcript>: i don't know

03:22:22
<transcript>: I don't know. There's the devops pro if you go that track like that's kind of developer stuff.

03:22:29
<transcript>: I have certain sandwich making my tiein sub will blow by mind that sounds amazing.

03:22:29
<transcript>: okay

03:22:31
<transcript>: Okay.

daglee: From Linus Torvalds latest rant: Devs do not know git.

03:22:46
<transcript>: I'm trying to catch up. I'm almost there. Job hunting right now feels really dire and disconnected. To be honest. Oh, not good. Thank you for the insight. Lerv from India. God bless. Keep up the good work. Best channel I've come across for honest Insights. Wow. This channel. This one right here.

03:22:49
<transcript>: Is Zoom, so I'm trying to keep the face.

03:22:53
<transcript>: Thank you so much. Those are kind words.

03:22:56
<transcript>: I am honest.

03:22:56
<transcript>: i'm honest

03:22:59
<transcript>: I'm honest. I don't know how much I have insides.

03:22:59
<transcript>: but i will give

03:22:59
thdxr: don't expect honesty when this channel streams among us

03:23:02
<transcript>: But I will give you honest words out of my mouth.

03:23:02
<transcript>: let's

spartangtr: @GlamShatterskull if i were a bettin man, i'd say this will change in somewhat short order, probably within a few months

03:23:18
<transcript>: Let's see there is an aws developer cert. There is my searcher in gcp DevOps line and I write old School Express handlebar html size for work, so my search don't really know where at all. Yeah, that's common. You go out and get a bunch of certs and then they're totally unrelated to what you actually work on.

03:23:24
<transcript>: Okay, from linus Torwall. The latest range rant devs do not know git. Oh, that's true.

03:23:24
<transcript>: i know

03:23:39
<transcript>: I know, like five commands, and it's enough. And I feel like I know some slightly more advanced git than the average dev. Maybe, but I still am like scratching the surface. It's amazing to me how much you can do and get that.

03:23:39
thdxr: i read a book on git like a loser

03:23:43
<transcript>: Why don't we all use all of it? Maybe it's a problem. Maybe.

03:23:48
glamshatterskull: they know enough to git by Kappa

03:23:51
<transcript>: You read a big book on Get like a loser. Maybe it gets problem, maybe get just built too many features and they weren't that important. That's why no one knows them.

03:23:51
<transcript>: how about that

03:23:53
<transcript>: How about that.

03:23:56
<transcript>: Don't expect honestly when this channel.

03:23:56
<transcript>: strings

03:24:00
<transcript>: Strings among us oh, yeah? When we saw stringing among us which will happen soon.

03:24:00
<transcript>: there will be

03:24:02
<transcript>: There will be a lot of.

03:24:05
thdxr: git's cli command structure is so bad

03:24:11
<transcript>: Game lying. It's only game lying. It's not real lying, because it's just a game and you're allowed to lie. It's like the point of the game.

03:24:11
<transcript>: if i were a bit man i'd

tayloreddev: git revert is evil

03:24:14
thdxr: similar commands can do completely different things

03:24:16
<transcript>: If I were a bit man, I'd say this will change in somewhat short order, probably within a few months. Are you talking about the job market.

03:24:21
christhemanguydude: i did the gcp associate developer cert because i had some extra time on my hand and my work paid for it. i am starting a new job now and not one company cared about my cert when i did interviews

03:24:22
<transcript>: They know enough to get by I love dad jokes. Glam. That's such a good one.

03:24:22
<transcript>: get cli

03:24:31
<transcript>: Get cli command structure is so bad. Get reverted evil similar commands can do completely different things. Yeah, I think gets over. I think there's too many features, too many features.

03:24:31

a_maher938: ?

03:24:53
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Chris. The Man guy. Dude. I did the gcp Associate developer shirt because I had some extra time on my hand and my work paid for it. I am starting a new job now, and not one company cared about my Cert. When I did interviews, that's a bummer. When you do a lot of hard work, you get a Cert, and then you realize you didn't need it. Nobody cared. That does. It hurts. I did that. I got twelve Cert.

03:24:53
<transcript>: certs and i

03:24:59
<transcript>: Certs, and I learned nobody cares. No, they're actually very helpful on a debit. I have one year of experience working with.

03:25:26
<transcript>: But I got with Murnsack, and I got a good video for an MVP. Should I go for it, or the lack of experience will be an issue.

03:25:33
<transcript>: I go for it. Always go for it. You got a good idea to build something and you have the skills to do it. Go for it.

03:25:33
<transcript>: you'll learn

03:25:35
meranofox: is what I share with people I know that when to learn

03:25:35
<transcript>: You'll learn something if nothing else.

03:25:37
<transcript>: Okay.

03:25:37
mattmancodes: That's those 12 certs working

03:25:44
thdxr: that zoom in on "go for it" is perfect

03:25:46
<transcript>: Oh, it's 10:00. This is this is it. This is the end of my stream coming up. So I guess I'm not going back to work. We're not gonna go back to the screen because.

03:25:46
<transcript>: time to be done

03:25:47

lozzek: any tips on people learning to code

03:25:50
thdxr: I think I might start streaming now

03:25:51
<transcript>: The Zoom in on go for it was perfect. Go for it.

03:25:54
<transcript>: Did it. Do it? No, I didn't do it that time.

03:25:57
thdxr: gonna move some stuff to new sst auth

03:26:00
<transcript>: Low zac. Welcome to Chat. Any tips on people learning to code things that follow Mr. Shack.

03:26:06
<transcript>: Tips people learning to code build stuff. I think that's the going.

03:26:06
<transcript>: advice

03:26:07
laytanl_: I love the zoom

03:26:15
<transcript>: Advice, everyone. Just. We've come to that consensus. Build stuff. You should build things. Real things. Preferably things you want to actually.

03:26:19
ttbishop: your camera and eyes staring at me is freaking me out

03:26:19
<transcript>: You like want them to exist if you have a reason like so for instance, my wife.

03:26:19
<transcript>: would

03:26:29
<transcript>: Would like me to build her something for her to take pictures of all the recipes she has and all these books and put them into a database where we can spit out.

03:26:29
<transcript>: a

03:26:49
<transcript>: A recipe, or I'm sorry, a shopping list every week that's broken into our grocery stores, like sections because it's such a tedious thing. We do every single week. We take this list of recipes we're gonna make this week, and we have to go through all the ingredients, figure out what we already have, what we don't. And then I know like this has been done a million times, but all the apps we've tried just cast up so she wants.

03:26:49
<transcript>: me to build

03:26:55
sockthedev: i need this app!

03:27:00
mac2k3: haha, building the same here at the moment, hi btw

03:27:01
sockthedev: literally me every week

03:27:08
tayloreddev: i'm building this

03:27:09
<transcript>: Me to build a little thing where we can take a picture of the recipes, put them on therebase just as fast as possible and then have it spit out our shopping list. When we select a few other recipes, she wants that to exist. I want it to exist because I want to make my wife happy. I'm happy when my wife is happy. So I am motivated to build that thing and I will build it and I'll build it well, because I want it to exist.

03:27:09
<transcript>: you need that

03:27:14
laytanl_: Thats not a little thing lol

03:27:29
<transcript>: You need that you need something that you really want to exist in the world, that you need it for some reason. And that'll help you get through and like, find solutions and just ship the thing faster. I feel like if I were just setting down and trying to take a course learning about building stuff and it was like, okay, build this Twitter clone. I would have no motivation to actually build the thing. You know what? I.

03:27:29
<transcript>: mean

03:27:40
<transcript>: Mean it would be very tedious to build, to do all the work. It's not a hard work to build anything. There's so many steps and to do all that work, but not really care if the end result is good or if it exists.

03:27:40
<transcript>: that'd be hard

03:27:42
<transcript>: That'd be hard for me.

03:27:44
<transcript>: Okay.

03:27:49
mattmancodes: solid advice

03:27:54
daglee: Didn't you kinda try to build a twitter clone though?

03:27:56
<transcript>: Love the Zoom. Good. Late, good, good. Gonna move some stuff to new ssd off. Oh, you start streaming. I'll rage you, dax, because I'm done here at ten. My time. Eleven. Your time.

03:27:56
<transcript>: i

03:28:02
<transcript>: I would love to rage you. Your camera and eyes staring at me is freaking me out. I look at a teleprompter.

03:28:04
<transcript>: There's a freak. You out.

03:28:04
<transcript>: looking at

03:28:09
a_maher938: how do you deal with working on a codeBase that you aren't familiar with the best approach to get familiar with it

03:28:09
sockthedev: @thdxr üíú

03:28:16
<transcript>: Looking at you in a teleprompter sock. You want the app? I'll make it public. I'll let you play with it, too. First time, Chad. Welcome to Chat Mac. Two K, three haha building. Same thing here. At the moment. You're building that recipe thing. Cool. I don't have to build it.

03:28:16
<transcript>: if you build

03:28:19
<transcript>: If you build it please let me know I would love to.

03:28:19
<transcript>: let

03:28:21
<transcript>: Let my wife use it.

03:28:21
<transcript>: because i

03:28:25
<transcript>: Because I have a hard time juggling all the things I'm doing.

03:28:25
<transcript>: every single day

03:28:26
<transcript>: Every single day in week.

03:28:26
<transcript>: what i

03:28:47
<transcript>: What I was gonna do is use texttrack, which is an aws ocr product. Like, take an image, get the text out of it. And I was gonna take that big blog of the text. The problem with ocr traditionally, I always have all kinds of ideas that like, oh, if I could use ocr, I get the text, and then it's like, what do you do with a big blava text? What you do is you tell chat gbt what your schema is, and then you pass.

03:28:47
<transcript>: it to bob

03:28:56
<transcript>: It to Bob attacks, and it puts it into the schema. I've done it. I've tested it. It works great. So you decide, like, here's my resipe schema. Here's a big blob of text from a recipe book.

03:28:56
<transcript>: fit it into

03:29:00
<transcript>: Fit it into that schema, and it will spit out the json object.

03:29:00
<transcript>: and then you can

03:29:06
<transcript>: And then you can store that in your database or whatever. That's how I was going to do it. You can steal that. Please build it. Someone. Please make this.

03:29:06
<transcript>: because i

03:29:09
<transcript>: Because I keep not getting it done.

03:29:11
<transcript>: I just haven't made time yet.

03:29:15
<transcript>: Okay. I'm building this. Taylor, build it, build it.

03:29:15
<transcript>: it's not a little

03:29:29
<transcript>: It's not a little thing. Oh, that's a little thing latent now. It's not a little thing. There's never a little thing. You always think it's a little thing, and then you get started and you're like, oh, geez, yes, lant, I have to do prettier. What do I have? How hard is it just to get a project stood up.

03:29:29
<transcript>: okay

03:29:31
<transcript>: Okay.

03:29:44
<transcript>: Solid advice. Didn't you try a counter? Tried to build a Twitter clone, though. Yeah, daglin, I wanted to build the backend. Just the api for Twitter clone to see how does serverless handle twitter's actual.

03:29:44
<transcript>: usage

03:29:47
<transcript>: Usage like actual track.

03:29:47
<transcript>: so the amount

03:30:00
<transcript>: So the amounts of tweets per second that Twitter actually gets. I wanted to see, could you build a serverless architecture that could handle that? What would it take? How much would you have to juggle the quotas and all that stuff? That's why I was working on it was called bitter.

03:30:00
<transcript>: bitter

03:30:00
mattmancodes: shhhhhh Elon will make you the only dev there

03:30:05
<transcript>: Bitter and you don't? Tweet you beat, beat, they're bitter like the vet.

03:30:11
mac2k3: the excel app on your phone (at least android) also has OCR built in, so I take pictures from the shopping bills, would probably work for recipes as well

03:30:14
<transcript>: How do you deal with working on a code base that you aren't familiar with? The best approach. This is the last question. And then I do have to go.

03:30:25
<transcript>: Aren't familiar with the best approach to get familiar with it. So coming into a new code base, that's always tough. I don't know if I have any tips on that. I've done it a few times. Logic? Exactly.

03:30:25
<transcript>: i've

03:30:45
<transcript>: I've done it a few times, just came into a project and had to get up speed and I don't know. I think like having a good first task, good feature or bug you need to fix or something helps kind of Wade you into the waters and then you just over time. It takes sometimes months to get up to speed on a codebase, depending on how complex. And I don't know if there's a way to rush that. I think you just kind of get you get into it over time.

03:30:45
<transcript>: as

03:30:55
<transcript>: As you need to get familiar with different parts. And I've worked in code bases for two years and still not understood. Huge swaths of it just like the corner that I worked in, you know, I'm saying.

03:30:55
<transcript>: mac

03:30:58
<transcript>: Mac. Thank you for that. Follow. Okay.

03:31:01
<transcript>: Elon will make you the only dead there.

03:31:04
<transcript>: Okay.

03:31:04
<transcript>: i'm done

03:31:08
<transcript>: I'm done. It's been so fun. I didn't get any work done.

03:31:08
<transcript>: i'm gonna

03:31:14
<transcript>: I'm gonna do that now. That's why I have to go off streams because I actually have to get some stuff done. I'm gonna finish these typescript, types.

03:31:18
<transcript>: I love this. I love streaming. I love how.

03:31:20
<transcript>: The Office Tour. That was fun.

03:31:25
<transcript>: I just cut off the music really hard? I'm gonna be done now? Oh, we zoomed in on me.

03:31:25
<transcript>: okay

03:31:30
meranofox: damn I missed the tour

03:31:30
<transcript>: Okay. The Zoom out. Okay. It's been so fun. Maybe we could do it again. Sometimes.

03:31:34
sockthedev: dax is online

<transcript>: i think it's so hot

16:03:49
<transcript>: I think it's so hot in here.

16:03:55
<transcript>: I just finished. Thank you so much.

16:03:59
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm gonna shut the window now.

16:04:06
<transcript>: I'm just doing an office tour. I didn't want it.

16:04:09
<transcript>: I'm gonna bring it back in.
