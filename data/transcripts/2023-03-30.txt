00:13:26
<transcript>: i had

00:13:30
<transcript>: I had a night of sleep last night that can only be described as.

00:13:34
<transcript>: Like Android Studio. It was a train wreck. It was just.

00:13:34
<transcript>: it was so

00:13:51
1camou: i won the macbook i think

00:13:53
<transcript>: It was so bad. I woke up. And if you told me my heart stopped in the night and I actually died for like an hour and then came back to life. I would believe you because some of my neck hurts, which is not that abnormal. That happens a lot. Like I wake up. My neck hurts. I'm old, like I'm getting old. I'm 36 years old.

00:13:57
<transcript>: But it was on top of that. I was in.

00:13:57
<transcript>: the most

00:14:04
looch94: wait it doesn't tell you if you don't win the macbook anymore?

00:14:09
<transcript>: The most sweaty pool of sweat I've ever been in in bed. And I have, like, a bed cooler. Like an ooler. It's a thing that just keeps your bed cool, like water is pumping through it, right.

00:14:09
<transcript>: still

00:14:11
<transcript>: Still sweaty mess.

00:14:17
<transcript>: My hair was like so greasy. It still is just so gross. Feeling.

00:14:25
<transcript>: Just everything about me feels like I die. And I think, you know what I think it is? I think it's that I came off of caffeine last night in my sleep.

00:14:30
thdxr: DW you never win, it's a scam

00:14:31
<transcript>: Caffeine, though? How do we all drink it? How is everybody addicted to caffeine when it's so awful.

<transcript>: You are here, right when I started today. Dex, that's nice. Camu. Did you win the macbook? You only win the macbook if it tells you in Chat that you won the macbook Nova. Thank you so much for that. Follow. I really appreciate it. Is frag here by chance? Because this morning I'm drinking a coffee. Well, a tea. I don't know why I call my tea coffee. I just want to fit in.

00:15:11
<transcript>: With everybody else.

00:15:11
<transcript>: i'm

00:15:13
<transcript>: I'm drinking a tea.

00:15:13
<transcript>: that's it

00:15:15
<transcript>: That's it right here.

00:15:17
<transcript>: English breakfast.

00:15:17
<transcript>: okay

00:15:30
nexxeln: what is the probability of winning? @adamdotdev

00:15:35
f0ll0w: hello awesome people!

00:15:35
<transcript>: Okay. English breakfast. I have some bones to pick with the English. It's awful. It's like black tea. It tastes so bad. Why would anyone drink this? What are you guys doing in England? Have you guys tried other things? Like salted caramel tea. It's so good. Black tea.

00:15:35
ayoungh: Lol

00:15:37

<transcript>: A little unkempt.

00:15:50

<transcript>: Caffeine.

00:15:59
<transcript>: i think it's just caffeine

00:16:06
thdxr: yeah Adam you look SO BAD

00:16:07
<transcript>: I think it's just caffeine withdrawals. What did I say earlier? That I replaced the syllable was a totally different syllable. What did I say? Smashed. No. Snatched.

00:16:07
<transcript>: ca

00:16:10
<transcript>: Caffeine, and snatched.

00:16:13
<transcript>: I don't know my brain.

00:16:31
dmdboi: Gottem

00:16:31
<transcript>: Is there a giveaway today? There's a giveaway every day. Now next, kind of there's a .01% chance of winning a MacBook if you just redeem.

00:16:31

<transcript>: That 1000 point chance at a macbook redeem you have a zero.

00:16:35
<transcript>: one percent

00:16:38
<transcript>: 1% Chance. There you go.

00:16:45
ayoungh: How do you redeem>

00:16:47
<transcript>: Next, just ask, what is the probability after I already said it and then read the question after, nah, caffeine is great. What do you mean? Yeah, it's great if you keep drinking it.

00:16:47
<transcript>: if you keep

00:16:50
ayoungh: I am a noob

00:16:52
<transcript>: If you keep drinking it. It's fantastic. It's not a scam. Dax.

00:16:56
<transcript>: You won, camou? Why do you think you won.

00:17:00
<transcript>: I don't see a message in chat. It'll tell us all in chat.

00:17:02
ayoungh: !redeem

00:17:04
1camou: im just very confident

00:17:12
<transcript>: It won't be sneaky about it. It'll just like broadcast it to everybody. It doesn't tell you if you don't win the macbook. No, it doesn't tell you if you don't win. Only if you do win. Sorry. I made a change. It was just getting a little overwhelming.

00:17:12
<transcript>: seeing all those

00:17:13
kryotoboi: Is coke great if I keep drinking it ?

00:17:14
<transcript>: Seeing all those chat messages.

00:17:21
<transcript>: I'm getting sick. Oh, maybe I am getting sick. I think it's the caffeine, though. Nighttime heatsink.

00:17:29
acioly_: good ideia, silence is gold LUL

00:17:30
<transcript>: My bed has a heat sink. It's water cooled. Actually, my bed is watercooled. That's pretty cool.

00:17:35
<transcript>: Hello.

00:17:35
<transcript>: follow hello

00:17:37
<transcript>: Follow Hello, awesome follow.

00:17:40
rodneypk: Good morning

00:17:43
1camou: why did you decide to build the app native instead of something like React Native or Capacitor.js

00:17:50
<transcript>: You called everyone in Chat, awesome people. And that's very kind of you. I say you people like, what do you people know? And you say, awesome people. People should follow you instead. And your name is follow.

00:17:50
<transcript>: i just

00:17:52
<transcript>: I just did that. I didn't even mean to.

00:17:54
<transcript>: How about that.

00:17:54
<transcript>: it

00:17:59
<transcript>: It's tea or nothing. Tear. Nothing, I guess. I guess.

00:18:03
<transcript>: Let's see. How do you redeem.

00:18:08
<transcript>: You look so bad. Dax. Ouch. Try Indian teas. I love Indian food.

00:18:08
<transcript>: so that would help

00:18:09
kryotoboi: Adam's giveaway now behaves like HRs. Did doesn't tell you if you don't win. It only calls you if you do win WutFace

00:18:12
<transcript>: So that would help. Did you put milk in it? No.

00:18:12
<transcript>: i did not

00:18:13
<transcript>: I did not.

00:18:13
<transcript>: no

00:18:17
<transcript>: No milk? Is that the problem? Did the English put milk in their tea.

00:18:20
<transcript>: Got them.

00:18:24
<transcript>: Did you figure out how to redeem.

00:18:24
<transcript>: you just go

00:18:37
<transcript>: You just go to the Channel point. See my little gold face in the corner of the bottom left corner. Gold coin. Those are Adam Bucks. You earn them and you can spin them on things like a chance at a macbook or a one on one call. No one's ever taken me up on that.

00:18:37
<transcript>: one

00:18:37
dmdboi: We put milk in the tea yes

00:18:41
kryotoboi: Try putting some tea in your cawffee

00:18:41
valentinecodes: english breakfast tea with milk, earl grey no milk - these are the rules imo

00:18:42
nutlesssquirrel: Yeah the English put milk in their tea and some sugar

00:18:43
<transcript>: One candle. You're just very confident. So I learned something about myself. Yesterday, I had a date with my wife.

00:18:43
dmdboi: Otherwise it tastes weird

00:18:46
<transcript>: Is coke great if I keep drinking it.

00:18:47
lesabotsy: I take coffee pills because coffee drink hurts my guts, and omg I feel like a superhero with them but like s*** without them.

00:18:47
nutlesssquirrel: if they're inclined

00:18:55
mecoupz: Hey everyone 👋

00:18:56
<transcript>: That has caffeine in it, right. Silence is gold. Welcome to Chat. Who is this? Welcome. It keeps bouncing around. My chat keeps bouncing around. I think twitch made some changes.

00:18:56
<transcript>: might have been

00:19:04
<transcript>: Might have been the layoffs. I don't know. Twitch made some changes, and I don't like it. Acioli. Welcome to Chat. Silence is gold.

00:19:09
<transcript>: So I learned something about myself yesterday. My wife is very.

00:19:09
thdxr: everyone shh we need to hear about this date

00:19:09
<transcript>: like

00:19:12
<transcript>: Like she likes to study people.

00:19:12
<transcript>: and

00:19:13
acioly_: HeyGuys

00:19:16
<transcript>: And me being the most important people in her life.

00:19:23
<transcript>: She likes to study me. And when we have dates, we end up talking a lot about our psychology because we both have discovered we're pretty sure.

00:19:43
<transcript>: 1314 years in a marriage and 36 years into life that we're both autistic. We really do believe that chat. You guys were responsible. You people. You helped me discover I might be autistic. And we've done some more digging. We're pretty sure we're both autistic. We haven't gotten clinically diagnosed, like officially diagnosed. We don't know if we will.

00:19:43
<transcript>: because we don't really care

00:19:44
<transcript>: Because we don't really care.

00:19:44
<transcript>: offic

00:19:48
thdxr: I'm 100% convinced Adam is NOT autistic

00:19:54
nexxeln: same

00:20:04
<transcript>: Officially, but it does help explain a lot of things about ourselves. One thing I've learned about myself is that I don't think about myself or I don't have a self image like we couldn't figure out yesterday. We spent a lot of time trying to figure out. Have I ever been offended in my life? And I don't think you can offend me. I don't think I'm offendable. The closest we've come is dax saying I'm a scammer. It almost.

00:20:04
<transcript>: offends me

00:20:06
<transcript>: Offends me. It doesn't.

00:20:06
<transcript>: but you can

00:20:09
thdxr: Adam doesn't know he's cringe

00:20:15
1camou: adam you are a boomer

00:20:18
<transcript>: But you can't offend me. So say what you want. Attack me all day long. Doesn't matter. I won't be offended. And we think that might be related to the autism. I don't know. We're doing a lot of reading, a lot of learning.

00:20:27
<transcript>: That's where we're at today. Rodney. Good morning. Good morning. Even my voice feels like it's coming back from the dead.

00:20:34
<transcript>: Why did you decide to build the app Native instead of something like React Native or capacitor. So everyone keeps asking this. Also, I've learned.

00:20:34
<transcript>: you just start building

00:20:41
<transcript>: You just start building something in Android studio, build a native app in kotlin, and everyone will tell you about the.

00:20:41
<transcript>: millions

00:20:48
<transcript>: Millions of different frameworks for cross platform development. Capacitor? Js. That's a new one. I don't know if I've been told that one I forgot.

00:20:54
tayloreddev: anybody up for roast adam stream to test that theory LUL

00:20:55
<transcript>: Flutter, flicker, flutter, flutter, react. Native capacitor.

00:20:55
<transcript>: something

00:21:01
<transcript>: Something ionic people have told me that there's so many of them. There was like three more. I can't even remember them.

00:21:05
acioly_: Wouldn't be better to launch the website before building the app?

00:21:08
<transcript>: Why I'm going to say it once today, and then I'm just going to tell people to go back to the VOD and listen at minute 21.

00:21:14
<transcript>: So I'm building the native app, while dax does the Big Brain back end stuff.

00:21:14
<transcript>: and

00:21:18
<transcript>: And I started in React Native Expo, more specifically.

00:21:25
<transcript>: And ran into an issue where we're using the One library for masking.

00:21:25
<transcript>: in

00:21:33
<transcript>: In React Native like mask. I need to take a video, a rectangle a video and apply a circle mask over it. And animate that circle mask.

00:21:33
<transcript>: very specific

00:21:39
<transcript>: Very specific requirement, but our app has some very specific animations. I'm trying to pull off.

00:21:39
<transcript>: and

00:21:43
thdxr: we want to go all out so committing to app right away

00:21:44
<transcript>: And that was not easy, but I got it working in iOS and.

00:21:50
<transcript>: The library just does not work in Android. Just doesn't says it does.

00:21:50
<transcript>: the page for

00:22:06
<transcript>: The page for the library. The breed me on the github or whatever says it supports Android. You can't mask and animate the mask on Android. That was frustrating. I have no way to suss out or diagnose or fix it. It's just like this library doesn't work. Nobody else has a library. What do I do.

00:22:06
<transcript>: so

00:22:22
<transcript>: So we're hoping I'm hoping by building it natively in each I can just get down to the lowest levels I need to to accomplish these very specific animations. It's not a big app like the actual Chrome of the app, like the actual functionality.

00:22:22
<transcript>: is very

00:22:32
<transcript>: Is very limited in scope, but very rich in interactivity and animation. So I think it's a good candidate for Native. That's my story. I'm sticking to it.

00:22:32
<transcript>: i'm going to be

00:22:36
<transcript>: I'm going to be defending that story probably every day for the rest of my life.

00:22:36
<transcript>: until we

00:22:39
<transcript>: Until we switch back to react native.

00:22:50
<transcript>: Adams giveaway now, but hey, it's like hrs. Why can't I read this sentence? Did doesn't tell you if you don't win.

00:22:50
<transcript>: it only calls you

00:22:52
andom: Hello HeyGuys

00:23:10
<transcript>: It only calls you if you do win. Yeah. Okay. I got you. It's like it'll only let you know if you win. Not if you don't win. That's right. Something about the beginning of that sentence really was my brain was just having a hard time. I can't wait till next week when I don't talk about my brain anymore. When I'm not on caffeine or coming off of caffeine. And I can just talk about normal people things. And I don't just keep saying my brain is so.

00:23:10
<transcript>: slow

00:23:17
smilingbig: hey adam hey chat o/

00:23:20

00:23:29
<transcript>: that was

00:23:33
<transcript>: That was my problem. Otherwise, it tastes weird. Well.

00:23:33
<transcript>: it tastes

00:23:35
<transcript>: It tastes weird. Stage.

00:23:35
<transcript>: yes

00:23:49
<transcript>: Yes. The English put milk in their tea and some sugar. I put no sugar in it either. It tastes awful. Like coffee. Dark, bitter, taste off all objectively. But I learned to like it. I don't think I'm going to learn to like English. Breakfast tea.

00:23:49
<transcript>: i take

00:23:54
smilingbig: personally I just have my tea black with two teabags

00:24:03
kryotoboi: Ketchup makes things taste better , just saying

00:24:03
<transcript>: I take coffee pills because coffee drink hurts my guts and omg. I feel like a superhero with them, but like shit without them. So less a boy. I used to take caffeine pills. I think you meant caffeine pills, not coffee pills, right.

00:24:03
<transcript>: they don't literally

00:24:06
<transcript>: They don't literally have coffee in them, right.

00:24:11
<transcript>: I used to take caffeine pills when I would go work out and stuff.

00:24:11
<transcript>: and

00:24:14
dmdboi: You had no milk or sugar? Did you decide to not like yourself today?

00:24:15
<transcript>: And that was intense. There was a lot of caffeine all at once.

00:24:20
<transcript>: And you're set. Okay, the coops is here. And nutless squirrel is here.

<transcript>: Adam doesn't know he's Chris.

00:24:53
<transcript>: Adam, you're a Boomer. Well, thanks. I don't know if that was meant in a derogatory way. I'm assuming that Boomer is derogatory.

00:24:53
<transcript>: how about baby

00:25:04
<transcript>: How about Baby boomers catching strays on the Internet? They're not even really on the Internet. They're probably on Facebook or something. But everyone just says boomer to make fun of people. And that's like their whole generation.

00:25:04
<transcript>: they're not

00:25:11
schrew: gm!

00:25:13

00:25:19

00:25:23
<transcript>: Seoli we did rebase TV check it out.

00:25:23

Ooh, that's intense. That's double the caffeine. I'm just trying to get a little bit of caffeine. So.

1camou: did that hurt you

00:26:11
<transcript>: i must not

00:26:21
thdxr: Adam is ugly and slightly overweight

<transcript>: That's right.

00:27:12
schrew: Press (x) to doubt

00:27:14
<transcript>: Right now we're going to work on rebase Android Studio. Why do I hate myself.

00:27:14
<transcript>: why do

00:27:17
<transcript>: Why do I use Android studio.

00:27:17
<transcript>: that's the question

00:27:18
mecoupz: work time? i think i'm in the wrong stream dax

00:27:22
dmdboi: What touchpad is that?

00:27:27
<transcript>: That's the question I'm asking myself this morning. Maybe I should have stayed dead last night. I think I died in my sleep. Maybe I should have just stayed dead because sounds better than Android Studio an MVVM.

00:27:31
<transcript>: And models and view models.

00:27:31
<transcript>: and

00:27:31
thdxr: @mecoupz be patient we'll see

00:27:33
<transcript>: And what else do I hate about this.

00:27:34
dmdboi: Trackpad? Fingerpad?

00:27:35
thdxr: how long this lasts

00:27:42
smilingbig: it's slow

00:27:53
<transcript>: There was something else. I hate that they brought back to my awareness, that I wish I had never remembered. What was it? Mvvm. And I mean, like, just all these files, this file tree. I feel like I could just roast Android Studio. Can I just roast all of Android development? I'd like to do a roast. Please. Do I have to register.

00:27:53
<transcript>: with

00:27:54
thdxr: where is the Ryan carniato of Android dev

<transcript>: where is the ryan

00:28:02
thdxr: why isn't anyone making a signals framework for it

00:28:05
<transcript>: Where is the Ryan Carnieto of Android Dev? Is there anyone famous that does Android Dev.

00:28:08
<transcript>: I feel like probably not.

00:28:13
overra_dev: Adam Reacts to Android Dev

00:28:17
<transcript>: Work time. I'm in the wrong stream. Decks. Yeah, I'm starting early today.

00:28:27
<transcript>: Yoast helped me introspect a little bit. He pointed out on Twitter that I do spend an hour talking at the beginning. I don't want to be that person. I don't want to just waste all of our time.

00:28:27
<transcript>: i need to

00:28:32
<transcript>: I need to get more done, so we're going to get a little more serious around here.

00:28:35
<transcript>: A little more work time. A little less.

00:28:35
<transcript>: talk time

00:28:46
thdxr: it's backwards no one wants you to work

00:28:50
<transcript>: Talk time. If you have Tweets, though when I do get the urge to not work, I'm going to want to get on Twitter. And if you have tweets that you want me to read on Twitter and react to or whatever, just paste the Tweet links. The Twitter links. The Tweet links.

00:28:52
nexxeln: Everyone who has ever loved you adam was wrong.

00:28:57
<transcript>: In my chat and they'll get picked up and automated and put into my browser here in a little bit.

00:29:01
<transcript>: So that'll be fun, Twitter time. That's what we do. It every day.

thdxr: IBS lol

00:29:30
<transcript>: Producer app. So now we're at the stage. I am sending data to ivs. Ivs. I always want to say ibs, but that's like a digestive issue, isn't it? Ivs. I'm sending it. Adam smells a little bit. Stop it off. Token may be Invalid for some reason. Removing it. Okay, dax, it's broken.

00:29:56
mecoupz: adam broke it again dax

00:29:56
thdxr: haha

00:29:58
<transcript>: Dax. I'm about to is devop. Oh, build. Failed. Sorry.

00:30:03
<transcript>: Just can't get good helper in here. I'm just kidding.

00:30:03
<transcript>: build

00:30:06
<transcript>: Build failed packages Trpz and I could not resolve.

00:30:11
<transcript>: I think you have to do this PM. Pm install.

00:30:14
<transcript>: Sorry, this is my fault.

00:30:21
<transcript>: Calm down, Producer app Calm down, Kim Pmdev We're coming. We're coming back.

00:30:29
<transcript>: You know what we're back to? Speaking of back, we're back, we're back to an old, favorite streaming playlist.

00:30:29
<transcript>: i changed

00:30:42
<transcript>: I changed the very first song. That's it the rest of it. It's the playlist you all know and love from my last season on twitch. I'm still calling it a season. I don't know. Adam reacts to Android dev. Yeah, that's what I'm going to be doing. The entire stream.

00:30:42
<transcript>: mv

00:30:47
<transcript>: Mvvmv Vmvvm says cryo, it's so true.

00:30:51
kryotoboi: Backstreets back again summer186Dnce

00:30:52
schrew: Ah yes, the "not" talking heads playlist!

00:31:00
<transcript>: How long this lasts? It's going to last as long as things actually work. As soon as they stop working. I'm going to get very distracted and probably not work. Let's see. Here we go.

00:31:05
<transcript>: I'm going to roast all Android devs with this stream. Thank you Adam, for giving me the Arsenal.

00:31:18
thdxr: lololol

00:31:19
smilingbig: KEKW

00:31:21
thdxr: every time.

00:31:23
schrew: KEKW

00:31:23
<transcript>: Everyone who has ever loved you, Adam. Oh, God. Oh, my word. That's so loud. Dax, can we do something about the volume on the producer app? Can we change the volume? Is it possible to adjust the volume in a solid app? Because I would like you to adjust the volume down, please.

00:31:23
<transcript>: that is

00:31:25
<transcript>: That is so loud.

00:31:25
tayloreddev: got em

00:31:27
mecoupz: adam got rick-rolled lol

00:31:28
<transcript>: Every time.

00:31:37
<transcript>: I died again. I got Rick rolled really hard. Oh my goodness, my heart rate Apple watch is going to start telling me I've got an issue.

00:31:40
magerdev: so are we tearing our way into android studio, or is android the source of our tears

00:31:45
<transcript>: Okay.

00:31:45
<transcript>: well it

00:31:48
<transcript>: Well, it's working. The producer app is up and running.

00:31:48
<transcript>: we're good

00:31:50
<transcript>: We're good.

00:31:58
<transcript>: It's interesting. You said Adam smells a little bit. And then I made the IBS joke. Dax, I just thought that was kind of interesting. The timing.

00:32:07
<transcript>: The not talking heads playlist exactly true.

00:32:09
thdxr: we have good chemistry

00:32:12
cowfacedev: well, we don't need points anymore LUL

00:32:16
thdxr: unlike people with ibs

00:32:17
<transcript>: Okay, so we are tearing our way into Android studio. Or is Android the source of our tears? Oh, tears. I didn't mean tearing. Oh, that's the same word, isn't it.

00:32:17
<transcript>: tear

00:32:21
<transcript>: Tear tears, I meant tears in Android studio.

00:32:21
<transcript>: you know

00:32:23
<transcript>: You know what I'm saying.

00:32:23
<transcript>: i

00:32:29
<transcript>: I see the confusion now tear tears in Android studio.

00:32:31
<transcript>: That's confusing.

00:32:31
<transcript>: we have good

00:32:42
<transcript>: We have good chemistry. Unlike people with IBS man. People with IBS taking strays. Just this stream. It's a little hostile. I need to calm down, okay, we got a stream. Url. I don't need to log it.

00:32:42
<transcript>: what

00:32:46
smilingbig: maybe you can add an emoji

00:32:46
<transcript>: What am I doing in here? Why am I in this file? I shouldn't be in this file.

00:32:54
overra_dev: https://twitter.com/thekitze/status/1641398246974054401

00:33:00
<transcript>: No, I have to use Android Studio. I always forget I keep coming back to my sweet, sweet neo van. And I'm like, let's do some programming, and then it's like, oh, no, we got to go to this hell scape.

00:33:04
thdxr: Adam must have seen a TikTok with the phrase "taking strays" yesterday

00:33:07
mecoupz: getting more and more adam bucks, feels like getting scammed for nfts :D

00:33:07
<transcript>: If I could never touch Android studio again I would be 10% happier for the rest of my life. Probably.

00:33:08
nzlaura: LUL

00:33:11
<transcript>: Adam must have seen a TikTok with the phrase taking strange issues.

00:33:18
<transcript>: That's a good roast. That was a good one, dax. That was good.

00:33:27
<transcript>: I might say it like four times today. I didn't hear it yesterday, but I do hear it on a podcast. There's a podcast. I listen to where they say it quite a bit now. He's love when they say it.

00:33:32
cowfacedev: there is a vim plugin for android studio LUL

00:33:39
<transcript>: So just going to say it a lot. That was good. Nz lora is here. Good. We can actually write some kotlin. Nz lore is here. Nz lore doesn't actively write kotlin, but they're the closest thing we have.

00:33:39
<transcript>: without nz

00:33:42
boomvroomshroom: "fun play"

00:33:47
<transcript>: Without Nzlora we have zero kotlin experience. Nz Laura at least has like a repo they can reference sometimes and so they know some things.

00:33:47
<transcript>: boom

00:33:48
thdxr: alan made a great meme yesterday

00:33:51
magerdev: if youre willing to spend the $ im a big fan on intellij and it supports android and a vim emulator

00:33:52
<transcript>: Boom, broom, shroom. Welcome to my Chat. Fun play, what's fun, play.

00:34:03
<transcript>: Alan made a Greek meme. He's a good meme maker. I'm realizing Allen really good at the memes. What is the Meme? Dax, can you like, put? Is it on Twitter? Can you just put the Tweet link in? That'd be great.

00:34:08
<transcript>: Getting more Adam Bucks feels like getting scanned for nft.

00:34:12
<transcript>: That's funny.

00:34:13
schrew: I do love when adam starts "working" 10/10 KEKW

00:34:18
<transcript>: So we get to do some pretty fun things today. Like, for instance.

00:34:22
<transcript>: I'm going to run the Android app now that's fun.

00:34:35
phelixtaken: When redeeming the 1000 point macbook, do you get a message if you win or is it like a random pick at x date?

00:34:37
nzlaura: that's awesome!

00:34:42
<transcript>: But what we get to do is work on the timed metadata. So I have the Android app working at the very end yesterday we finally got it working with fetching a streamyroll because we use like an auth mechanism for getting a stream URL so not just anybody can watch Rick Roll or Me or dax whenever we start rebase TV.

00:34:46
<transcript>: So it's actually getting the data. The feed.

00:34:46
<transcript>: from

00:34:50
<transcript>: From the ivs. Not to be confused with IBS.

00:34:50
<transcript>: it's getting

00:34:54
nzlaura: so good

00:34:57
overra_dev: dedicated rickroll app

00:35:02
<transcript>: It's getting that feed. And we've got Rick roll here. I'm pumping Rick roll. Just so you know, just so everyone knows how it all ties together. You know, you might care about the details. Where is it? Right here. Not right here, but right here.

00:35:02
<transcript>: we've got

00:35:09
<transcript>: We've got a ffmpeg stream or I'm just streaming this local file to ibs, which is an Amazon service.

00:35:17
<transcript>: An Amazon Web Services service, if you will, I'm streaming that video to ivs, and then this client.

00:35:17
<transcript>: is

00:35:22
<transcript>: Is consuming. It. The wonders of the Internet. It's magic.

00:35:25
<transcript>: I do love when Adam starts working.

00:35:25
<transcript>: ten

00:35:27
<transcript>: Ten out of ten.

00:35:41
<transcript>: If you're willing to spend the money. I'm a big fan of intellij, and it's sports Android and a vim emulator major. The one thing I've noticed as I have begun developing Android, everyone uses a different IDE.

00:35:41
<transcript>: and

00:35:44
<transcript>: And everyone uses a different multiplatform framework.

00:35:44
<transcript>: like ion

00:35:49
<transcript>: Like ionic or reactive or react native or whatever.

00:36:03
<transcript>: And I've gotten a new recommendation for both of those things every single day. So I think I'm doing the worst possible thing you can do by developing an Android specific app in Android Studio, I've gathered that that is not the approach most people take.

00:36:03
<transcript>: i

00:36:06
<transcript>: I'm going to keep moving forward with it because.

00:36:06
<transcript>: i'm so

00:36:16
<transcript>: I'm so just like paralyzed from indecision. There's just so many options, and people have recommended them all. And I'm just going to stick with the thing that has Android in the name.

00:36:16
<transcript>: i'm not going to

00:36:21
magerdev: once you go intellij

00:36:22
lilfreezi: hey good lookin

00:36:25
<transcript>: I'm not going to add Vin bindings to it. People have said you can make it better if you added Vin bindings. That sounds like getting comfy. I don't want to get comfy in here. I just want to get in. Get out. You know what I'm saying.

00:36:25
<transcript>: there's a joke

00:36:28
magerdev: there is no turning back

00:36:29
<transcript>: There's a joke in there somewhere that I would not make because.

00:36:30
kryotoboi: Adam didn't mention Flutter. Did the hype around Flutter die ?

00:36:33
magerdev: its a cult

00:36:35
smilingbig: g

00:36:38
smilingbig: whoops KEKW

00:36:41
nzlaura: @MagerDev i mean until you run out of memory

00:36:42
<transcript>: I don't make those types of jokes. There's no toning back. Lil Freeze is here anytime I'm feeling a little bad about myself. A little Freezey comes in makes me feel good, says I look good, says I'm breedable I'm looking breathable some days that feels good.

00:36:57
thdxr: breedable is such a cursed word

00:37:00
kryotoboi: Lets do android dev on Sublime

00:37:02
<transcript>: I guess that's a little risque breedable. I mean, that implies some things, but I like it didn't mention flutter. Did the hyper unflutter diet? No, don't worry, cryo. I just forgot. Everyone's recommended flutter. I think it's the number one recommended thing. I'm so sorry, everyone. I'm going to be doing the bad way. Which is this way. Android.

00:37:02
<transcript>: studio okay

00:37:03
thdxr: I cringe whenever Adam says it

00:37:08
<transcript>: Studio. Okay, so what we're going to do now? We can use the producer app. Thank you, DAX.

00:37:08
<transcript>: we can

00:37:10
lilfreezi: @thdxr its beautiful

00:37:13
<transcript>: We can send a question which we have this airtable thing.

00:37:14
thdxr: well, cringe more than I already am

00:37:19
magerdev: they solved those issues as far as Im aware.  my computer is low on memory and never has that issue

00:37:21
<transcript>: This is my first exposure to airtable, and now I can send questions over the ivs timed metadata api or whatever.

00:37:21
<transcript>: you can basically

00:37:23
<transcript>: You can basically.

00:37:23
<transcript>: embed

00:37:26
<transcript>: Embed json payloads, or just any string.

00:37:26
<transcript>: into the

00:37:43
<transcript>: Into the video feed. It's like embedded in ID three Tags in the video stream. And then the clients can all make sure that they only make certain actions like show the question for the trivia game at the same moment in the video. So if you're a five second delay on the video.

00:37:43
<transcript>: you're not behind

00:37:44
smilingbig: tune

00:37:48
<transcript>: You're not behind in terms of answering the question. You have no unfair.

00:37:53
<transcript>: Nobody has a competitive advantage, right? Everybody gets the question at the same moment on the feed.

00:37:53
<transcript>: that's how

00:37:59
<transcript>: That's how it works. And this little app is going to pump it onto the ivs feed. The problem is.

00:38:05
magerdev: its something ive heard a lot about intelliJ but literally never once exoerienced and  I only rock 16g of memory

00:38:06
<transcript>: This app here was not them. I know. There's been bindings. I know. Don't tell me.

00:38:06
<transcript>: there

00:38:12
<transcript>: There's a place here where it takes the metadata. Let's do this. Metadata.

00:38:12
<transcript>: it takes

00:38:15
<transcript>: It takes the metadata and.

00:38:15
<transcript>: is this it

00:38:25
<transcript>: Is this it? No on queue. Here we go on metadata. Nope. That's not it. We want to find other instances of on metadata. Is it this one.

00:38:25
<transcript>: no

00:38:27
<transcript>: No, not that one.

00:38:33
kryotoboi: Hiding json in id3 tags, not hacky et all. SeemsGood

00:38:36
<transcript>: We got to change the way it handles on metadata, because currently, wow, there's so many references to on metadata.

00:38:39
magerdev: usually with 20 chrome tabs taking all my real memory

00:38:40
<transcript>: So this one. No. Have I tried all of them now.

00:38:44
<transcript>: I think I tried all of them.

00:38:48
<transcript>: On metadata.

00:38:48
<transcript>: well

00:39:01
<transcript>: Well, it's not handling. It might be in here. It might just be in here. It's not handling the shape. Here we go, here we go, here we go. On metadata. Why did that one not show up on the world? That was in this folder, right? I don't know. Okay.

00:39:01
<transcript>: this

00:39:03
joaopedroovb: share your playlist on spotify

00:39:17
<transcript>: This is the problem. This code was meant for an example app that we started with and I need to change it to work with the shape of our questions. And then we'll be able to pop up our questions from airtable in the app. Steel thread complete. Feels good.

00:39:17
<transcript>: from there

00:39:22
<transcript>: From there. It's really just all about making it look nice, right? That's basically it.

00:39:24
<transcript>: Joip.

00:39:24
<transcript>: joiped

00:39:26

mercurios_broken_rib: @adamdotdev Do you use any products for your glorious beard?

00:40:16
<transcript>: It's something I've heard a lot about intellij, but literally never once experienced. And I only rock 16 gigs of memory hiding json and ID, three Tags, not hacky at all. It's not hacky cryo. It's actually pretty clever if you think about it because.

00:40:16
<transcript>: otherwise

00:40:27
joaopedroovb: thank y

00:40:33
<transcript>: Otherwise, if all the clients are connected to some api and getting data that way, like when they should pop up a question. It's not in sync with the video. This is a way to sync it with frames of the video. It's pretty cool. I think it's pretty clever, personal. I find it clever.

00:40:33
<transcript>: usually

00:40:38
magerdev: i agree, its a pretty clever hack

00:40:39
<transcript>: Usually with 20 Chrome tabs taking all my real memory. Chrome is the worst offender.

00:41:04
<transcript>: Do you use any products for your glorious beard? Me. I don't have a glorious beard. You serious? Have you seen dax's beard? You should really join dax's stream.

00:41:04
<transcript>: my beard not

00:41:06
<transcript>: My beard. Not so glorious.

00:41:12
<transcript>: I've got a lot of Gray in it, if that's what you mean by glorious do I look very wise.

00:41:12
<transcript>: because that's all

00:41:46
<transcript>: you're saying it

00:41:54
<transcript>: You're saying it's not a scam to seed the idea that it could be a scam. It's not a scam. It's not. Dax put you up to that, didn't he? Didn't he? Smiling big.

smilingbig: KEKW

00:42:03
<transcript>: I agree. It's a pretty clever hack. What are the odds for the macbook 1%? Not big odds, but they're odds. Gray is good.

<transcript>: Once, you guys.

00:42:24
<transcript>: drink your tea

00:42:26
<transcript>: Drink your tea like that.

00:42:26
<transcript>: it'll happen

00:42:30
thdxr: LOL

00:42:32
<transcript>: It'll happen? Is it because I'm drinking English breakfast tea this morning? Is that the reason.

00:42:33
smilingbig: LUL

00:42:36
lilfreezi: thats basic thugonomics to drink with your pinky up

kalo0m: hey adam, when you use neovim, do you use a tool to manager your git?

00:42:44
<transcript>: Dxr. Optimized. His hair.

00:42:44
bishopdev: @adamdotdev I do the same thing  with the pinky and my wife keeps giving me shit about it !!

00:42:47
thdxr: it's like those japanese mangoes where they limit each branch to one mango

00:42:48
<transcript>: That is why his beard is good, because it's focused on one place.

00:42:49
bishopdev: I do it when I drink beeer

00:42:54
<transcript>: Dax, you're catching strays. Watch out. Catching strays.

00:42:54
<transcript>: strays

00:42:55
magerdev: wedo respect you less everytime unfortunately

00:42:55
<transcript>: Strays.

00:42:59
<transcript>: That's basic thugonomics drink with your Pinky up. Oh, is it okay.

00:43:01
<transcript>: A kaloom.

00:43:01
<transcript>: when

00:43:03
magerdev: but we still love you

00:43:21
<transcript>: When you use Neovam, do you use a tool to manage your git? I do not. I've never been much of a get tool guy. I do like three git commands and I've never needed a tool to manage those. I know some people swear by some of the tools. I forget their names. I think I even have one installed, but I don't know the key bind and I don't use it. I probably installed it because.

00:43:21
<transcript>: it was just

00:43:24
<transcript>: It was just like everybody else had it installed.

00:43:33
<transcript>: Bishop, you do the same thing with your Pinky and your wife's, not she's giving you. My wife keeps giving me shit about it.

00:43:33
<transcript>: it's like

00:43:41
allieway: git add . git commit git push

00:43:41
<transcript>: It's like those Japanese mangoes, where they limit each branch to one mango. Yeah. You told me about that yesterday, I think. Or I dreamed it.

00:43:41
<transcript>: okay

00:43:45
vimcerf: I could never trust a tool to not mess up my repos, given how easy it is to mess up a repo to begin with

00:43:45
<transcript>: Okay. We do respect you less every time. Unfortunately.

00:43:46
camdickie: this might be a cringe question, hwo did you setup the bottom overlay with your spotify song? did you make this yourself?

00:43:55
<transcript>: Every time I raise my pinky, you're respect me a little bit less. That's fine. I'll take that trade off. You still have me. Okay, alleyway. Welcome.

00:43:55
<transcript>: to

00:43:58
juniornascm: i have git fugitive in nvim, never used a command but just using :git as command instead of :!git feels great

00:44:00
<transcript>: To chat. Git ad period. Git commit. Get pushed. Exactly. Those are my three commitments.

00:44:00
<transcript>: i don't need

00:44:06
magerdev: if you cant gif diff your way through your changes, its too big a change to be comitted

00:44:09
<transcript>: I don't need anything to manage that for me. I could never trust a tool to not mess up my repos. Why am I? Why am I? Why am I just reading? What am I doing? I'm not just reading chair and I'm working.

00:44:13
smilingbig: LUL

00:44:17
<transcript>: This just my work time has turned into chat time. I just wanted to be on this screen to do it. Is that the idea.

00:44:17
thdxr: @camdickie don't worry no one can be as cringe as Adam

00:44:21
<transcript>: Fugitive. That's the name.

00:44:25
<transcript>: That could be as cringe as Adam. Stop it. Would you stop it.

00:44:33
<transcript>: How did you set up the Bottom overlay with your spotify song? Did you make this yourself? Cam? Dicky? I sure did. My overlays are open source.

00:44:36
adamdotdev: !overlays

00:44:37
<transcript>: So here you go here you go.

00:44:37
<transcript>: overlays

00:44:40
<transcript>: Overlays or just GitHub.

00:44:40
<transcript>: or i'll

00:44:46
<transcript>: Or I'll just do this. Https. Github.com Adam Elmore.

00:44:47
adamdotdev: https://github.com/adamelmore/overlays

00:44:54
<transcript>: Overlays. There you go. You can see how I did it right there. I think I did it kind of inefficiently.

00:44:54
<transcript>: it's just like

00:44:57
allieway: I'm going to steal all of your code

00:45:00
<transcript>: It's just like constantly spamming the Spotify API like, hey, are you doing something? Hey, are you listening to music.

00:45:00
<transcript>: like constantly

00:45:01
camdickie: Pog thank u

00:45:12
juniornascm: you have a app to the overlays?

00:45:18
juniornascm: thats genius, never tought about it

00:45:20
<transcript>: Like constantly just steal all my code. I'm actually considering making it all a little better so that other people could use it. I never built it thinking other people use it, but I want to teach other devs how they could get into streaming because I've loved it so much. And I thought maybe part of it is they need somewhere to start with their overlays so I could kind of trim down or make it more general purpose.

00:45:20
<transcript>: my overlay

00:45:30
<transcript>: My overlays are very specific to me, but maybe I could help people get started. I don't know. Maybe. I think nextjs is actually a great framework for building your overlays because.

00:45:33
camdickie: im almost done my undergrad, thinking i might start dev streaming soon :P

00:45:50
<transcript>: You can run on the server side just like node stuff on your machine. If you want to interact with your machine through channel points or whatever else, you can quickly send up api routes that are really easy to interact with. I think it's a pretty great framework for you got to react app that you can build out all the interactivity with animations and whatever very familiar. But then you've got all the node stuff.

00:45:50
<transcript>: that you can just

00:45:59
<transcript>: That you can just run the app locally, which is what I do and get the best of both worlds. Okay, anyway, why am I talking about that? I don't remember why I got on it, but.

00:45:59
<transcript>: i'm going to

00:46:00
thdxr: what about my infinite scale serverless architecture for my overlay

00:46:01
<transcript>: I'm going to stop now.

00:46:01
<transcript>: going to

00:46:07
<transcript>: Going to stop if you can't dip your way through your changes, it's too big a change to be committed. That's a good stance.

00:46:10
smilingbig: I feel like if you want to do well streaming on twitch you should probably use rust btw LUL

00:46:22
<transcript>: What about my infinite scale serverless architecture for my overlay? Yeah, I'm curious to ask, how does that work? You actually deploy all your overlay stuff somewhere to the internet.

00:46:22
<transcript>: because i

00:46:27
<transcript>: Because I love that I just run mine locally. Something about that feels nice.

00:46:29
<transcript>: I guess it's more like machine.

00:46:29
<transcript>: resources

00:46:32
<transcript>: Resources being used so there's that.

00:46:32
thdxr: yeah https://twitch

00:46:40
<transcript>: All right, so here's what we're going to do on metadata, print line.

00:46:40
<transcript>: data

00:46:41
<transcript>: Data.

00:46:41
thdxr: https://twitch.thdxr.com

00:46:45
<transcript>: That's not vim data.

00:46:45
<transcript>: what is

00:46:48
<transcript>: What is buffer, though? Data is what.

00:46:48
<transcript>: question

00:46:52
<transcript>: Question model Json from json.

00:46:54
thdxr: I just don't like having to bring something up locally every time

00:46:54
<transcript>: I guess.

00:46:59
<transcript>: I could not do that. And I could just actually go in and update this.

00:47:02
<transcript>: Go to.

00:47:02
<transcript>: go to

00:47:03
<transcript>: Go to.

00:47:03
<transcript>: decl

00:47:05
<transcript>: Declaration.

00:47:05
<transcript>: question

00:47:11
<transcript>: Question model. So here we go. Let's look at what dax did for the question model in here.

00:47:14
<transcript>: What is this.

00:47:16
<transcript>: Core question.

00:47:20
<transcript>: Is what.

00:47:25
<transcript>: Text. Is this it is this the shape of it? It's an Air table base.

00:47:27
<transcript>: Info.

00:47:32
<transcript>: What is the shape, dax? What is the shape.

00:47:34
thdxr: @adamdotdev look at the producer console log

00:47:37
<transcript>: Https. Twitch.

00:47:38
thdxr: when you send a question

00:47:38
<transcript>: twitchdxr

00:47:38
<transcript>: twitchdxr com so

00:47:42
<transcript>: Twitchdxr.com so I can go to that and see your overlays running all the time.

00:47:44
thdxr: the message will be logged

00:47:49
<transcript>: Interesting Producer console log when you send a question, the message will be logged. Oh, perfect.

00:47:53
<transcript>: So I can see the shape of it right here.

00:47:53
<transcript>: in the

00:47:57
<transcript>: In the console, just like this.

00:47:57
<transcript>: cons

00:48:03
<transcript>: Console and I'm going to send a message just like this. Another question.

00:48:07
<transcript>: Got message there it is no.

00:48:07
<transcript>: got

00:48:11
<transcript>: Got message. There it is. Wait, is this the shape of it.

00:48:11
<transcript>: proper

00:48:23
<transcript>: Properties. Answers. Is this like a trpc thing? I bet this is like a trpc thing. How do I make it just json? I just want to see it like raw. You know what I'm saying.

00:48:23
<transcript>: i want to

00:48:23
laytanl_: What an app!

00:48:25

00:48:36
<transcript>: Text savvy Travis here. Good morning. Tech. Savvy. So. Tech savvy.

00:48:36
<transcript>: or i guess

00:48:38
thdxr: that's not a tRPC thing

00:48:39
<transcript>: Or I guess I can call you Trav, trav.

00:48:39
<transcript>: i

00:48:40
<transcript>: I.

00:48:43
thdxr: that's the whole message

00:48:43
smilingbig: o/

00:48:47
thdxr: can copy as JSON I think

00:49:01
<transcript>: Have seen you so much on Twitter. I thought I followed you. So yesterday, when I joined your stream, I was like, oh, I didn't know you stream. And you're probably like, how do you even know who I am? Because I've known you. I feel like I've known you because I just see you on Twitter all the time. But I wasn't following you. And sometimes that surprises me when I think I'm following somebody. And I'm not. So when I said that yesterday, I genuinely meant it, like, oh, I didn't know you streamed. I.

00:49:01
<transcript>: know you're from

00:49:08
<transcript>: Know you're from Twitter, and then I followed you. And then anyway, I just had to explain all that. I just had to clear the air.

00:49:08
<transcript>: akmad thank

00:49:08
techsavvytravvy: hahaha i get that

00:49:17
allieway: Do you need caffeine for your brain or does the caffeine need you?

00:49:20
<transcript>: Akmad, thank you so much for the follow. Okay, I got to explain why I said it like that. I may have still botched it, but I used to work with an Ahmed, and I got tired of sounding like a dumb hillbilly being like, hey, Ahmed.

00:49:20
<transcript>: so

00:49:30
<transcript>: So I really spent time working with him, like, trying to pronounce it better. And he was like, you don't have to do the guttural thing. I was like, no, I'm committed. I want to do the guttural thing.

00:49:30
<transcript>: so that

00:49:32
thdxr: you still sound like a hillbilly

00:49:38
<transcript>: So that's what I do. Ahmed, am I doing it? Okay. I worked with him for, like, a year. So I've learned how to say that name very specifically.

00:49:48
<transcript>: Does it bother you? Just let me know if it bothers you and you'd rather me. Just say Ahmed or Ahmed. I can do that too. Cam. Dickey, thank you so much for the follow.

00:49:48
<transcript>: i really

00:49:51
<transcript>: I really appreciate that alleyway. You too.

00:49:51
<transcript>: and i already told

00:49:58
<transcript>: And I already told Ahmed. I'm sorry I was overdone. I overdid the guttural there. That's my fault.

00:49:58
<transcript>: you sound like

00:50:02
<transcript>: You sound like a hillbilly. Thanks, dax. Thanks for that.

00:50:08
<transcript>: It's not a trpc thing. That's the whole message. Okay, can copy as json, I think. Oh, okay.

00:50:08
<transcript>: i can do that

00:50:09
techsavvytravvy: it's like when giada says cilantro

00:50:10
<transcript>: I can do that.

00:50:10
<transcript>: i can do

00:50:11
laytanl_: Dax is always supportive

00:50:17
<transcript>: I can do that. Let's do Shout Out. I wish my mods would just be on top of things. Guys, come on, shout out.

00:50:28
techsavvytravvy: thanks!!

00:50:30
<transcript>: Dax is always supportive. Always so supportive.

00:50:30
<transcript>: it's like

00:50:37
<transcript>: It's like when giada, says, cilantro, Who's giada? Did I mispronounce that.

00:50:37
<transcript>: cilantro

00:50:45
<transcript>: Cilantro? Did I say cilantro? Right? Do you need caffeine for your brain? Or does the caffeine need you? That's a great question, allie. Probably both.

00:50:45
<transcript>: it's a

00:50:47
<transcript>: It's a symbiotic relationship.

00:53:45
<transcript>: i'll just

<transcript>: Vibe into the world, sprinkling a little bit of like, I hope the people who randomly get selected need a macbook, and I'm going to feel really good knowing people in need of macbooks getting macbooks.

00:54:12
camdickie: lim_{t->\infty} macbooks = \infty

<transcript>: i'm very

00:54:58
<transcript>: I'm very curious.

00:55:03
<transcript>: and also

00:55:16
<transcript>: And also are you back in leadership or back having fun? Are you someone that works at sap News? Who is alleyway? You are a jerk. Okay, text decks versus video decks is different vibe. No easily way on video too.

<transcript>: This is Russell crow. He's already fat. That's funny.

00:55:20
<transcript>: but i guess every

00:55:41
camdickie: Ive seen you on twitter a few times, but this is my first stream. you are very charismatic! loving the vibes from this stream, do you stream consistently?

00:55:52
<transcript>: Random chance of 0% latent if you round down at zero but it's 0.1% so there is a chance you're not wasting your points. Some one is literally going to be typing on their MacBook this time next year because they just redeemed 1000 point channel point thing Adam Bucks which are basically free.

00:55:56
<transcript>: Because they just did that. So you might as well be that person.

00:55:57
laytanl_: adamdo8Lego  <- what is this emote?

00:55:59
<transcript>: Alo Friezi surely could go for a MacBook.

00:56:00
vimcerf: w! peepoHappy

<transcript>: Happy? What's? That.

00:56:17
magerdev: i cant wait for the coffeezilla episode on adambucks

00:56:18
<transcript>: I'm going to go grab my breakfast, watch some Adam before going live later today. That sounds awesome. Major. I would love to check you out on Stream. I'm following you now on twitch. I think I saw you joined Watch dev and let us know that you stream.

00:56:18
<transcript>: cronix

00:56:27
<transcript>: Cronix. Thank you for that. Prime. Sub. Prime. Sub. It's like getting a valentine. No, it's not because there's lots of valentine's. It's like.

00:56:27
<transcript>: getting

00:56:36
<transcript>: Getting what's something you can only get one person, because that's what prime subs are. You only have one of them and you gave it to me. And that means so much to me.

00:56:39
schrew: virginity?

00:56:42
<transcript>: Means so much. Thank you so much. Chronics. We hadn't even gotten to know each other.

00:56:42
<transcript>: you just threw

00:56:42
thdxr: virginity

00:56:42
camdickie: a monogomous relationship

00:56:43
cronexi: <3

00:56:44
kryotoboi: A kidney ?

00:56:45
<transcript>: You just threw the prime sub at me.

00:57:05
<transcript>: Nice. Let's J. Yeah, it's the best I've seen you on Twitter a few times. This is my first stream. You are very charismatic, loving the vibes from the stream. Do you stream consistently? I do Cam dicky, it's funny thing about me streaming and doing anything consistently. I do it consistently until I burn out and take three months off. That's what happened the first time I streamed back last year.

00:57:05
<transcript>: i started

00:57:11
overra_dev: u get one prime sub a month tho

00:57:17
smilingbig: that's my system too LUL

00:57:22
<transcript>: I started in July stream for, like, three or four months, then took three months off, and I'm back. And every day I stream. Every day. I love it. It's so much fun. I'll be doing it until I'm not. And then I'll take a break and I'll come back. It's just kind of how I work. I'm a little intense. I obsess, and then I move on.

00:57:25
camdickie: awesome, hope youll see more of me :)

00:57:30
thdxr: streaming every day is fun but also a lot

00:57:34
<transcript>: What is this? Emote ae. It's just my name, but it's like legos. Mark made that for me. Anybody remember? Mark is a good guy. He used to give me all the answers.

00:57:34
<transcript>: in

00:57:47
<transcript>: In all of my problems. He wrote all my code Mark was great. And he was one of the mods. And then I think he just got tired of me. Maybe he was just tired of doing all the free work. I don't know. I actually paid him for that emote, though. I paid him for all the emotes he made.

00:57:47
<transcript>: i can't wait

00:58:07
<transcript>: I can't wait for the Coffee zilla episode on Adam Bucks with Coffeezilla virginity? Why did you both just say virginity? What is that? Oh, you can only give your virginity once. Oh, I see a monogamous relationship cronics. Welcome to Chat coming in with the heart. How'd you make that heart? I always make the heart. And it's that dumb, like twitch. Chat, bubble heart. And I don't like.

00:58:07
<transcript>: it

00:58:10
<transcript>: It. I don't know how you made that one.

00:58:10
<transcript>: a kidney

00:58:21
<transcript>: A kidney. You can only give one kidney. That's true, too. You guys are good at this. You're good at trivia like this. You get one prime sub a month, though. Oh, so you could give twelve of them a year. Okay, that makes sense.

00:58:21
<transcript>: it's my system

00:58:26
<transcript>: It's my system, too. I hope you'll see more of me. I do hope I'll see more of you. Camden.

00:58:50
vimcerf: @night_light90 I think Adam has turbo and get the glitch heart instead

00:58:53
<transcript>: Streaming every day is fun, but also a lot. It really is. Zack, it's a lot. I realize I Orient so much of my life around it. When I'm streaming, it becomes the thing I do. And I want to find a way to make it sustainable, where it's just, like, blends into my life. But it always takes over. It's always like, the thing I do.

00:59:01
magerdev: was just trolling the adam bucks

00:59:04

techsavvytravvy: i get that adam, i've had to really make a conscious effort to focus on my actual job

00:59:41
<transcript>: Next you're making me salty. You're making me like criticize you. And normally you just criticize me. But you've done it so much now that.

00:59:50
<transcript>: I want to take digs at you. And that's not in my nature. So this is the shape of it. I'm confused. What is this shape.

00:59:50
<transcript>: oh

00:59:53
<transcript>: Oh, well, this needs to be like, indented or something.

00:59:59
<transcript>: That's the problem. Maybe one of the problems. But it's going on here.

00:59:59
<transcript>: properties this

01:00:02
<transcript>: Properties this all should be invented. Maybe.

magerdev: wish me luck, its like entering pandora

01:00:46
<transcript>: Oh, a map. No, I want to make another object. You know what I mean? I don't want to have to define another model. I guess I'm going to have to just define another model. It's fine.

<transcript>: Moan kotlin.

<transcript>: String. String. So this is properties.

01:01:25
<transcript>: proper

01:01:27
<transcript>: Properties.

01:01:32
<transcript>: Hitting escape as if it's them. It is not vim. It is just.

01:01:32

01:01:34
<transcript>: Android studio.

01:01:38
camdickie: Kotlin BibleThump

01:01:50
thdxr: does kotlin have discriminated unions

01:01:52
<transcript>: Like leaving your house.

01:01:57
<transcript>: Sounds awful.

01:02:05
<transcript>: Hey, is my camera cut to like a cool panning shot today? Has it done that because I feel like it hasn't.

01:02:09
<transcript>: Has it cut to this shot yet today anybody tell me.

01:02:09
<transcript>: i feel like

01:02:13
<transcript>: I feel like it's not randomly doing that anymore.

01:02:13
<transcript>: it used to randomly do

01:02:18
<transcript>: It used to randomly do it, but I feel like it's not doing it. Can someone confirm.

01:02:19
<transcript>: Please.

01:02:20
schrew: Don't think so?

01:02:22
<transcript>: Confirm.

01:02:24
camdickie: wait... you use a trackpad???

01:02:27
camdickie: and no it hasn't

01:02:27
<transcript>: Don't think so. Yeah, I don't think so either. Does Colin have discriminated unions? Great question.

01:02:35
<transcript>: I do Cam, dicky. I do use a trackpad. Why is my overlay not randomly doing that anymore.

01:02:40
<transcript>: Maybe. Oh, I know why? Because it's only when I do this.

01:02:40
<transcript>: when

01:03:01
<transcript>: When I transition to this scene. Oh, I can fix that. Yeah, I can fix that now. It's going to randomly cut to that. Okay, sorry. Just a little behind the scenes. For those who are curious, this stream should be in just chatting. It really should be less boy. I mean less a bot. I'm sorry. I keep telling you less a boy. I really should just do the just chatting thing. I should just stop pretending. I'm going to be a programmer on twitch. I'm really not. I'm just a talker on.

01:03:01
<transcript>: twitch

01:03:01
allieway: Never heard of smartmuse or you before 15 minutes ago  Crunchbase has public rounds for any company, linkedin has an employee list, and I have intuition.   The move now is to actively be raising(pretty damn hard right now without a major product change), or put all energy in the small amount of months left into making major product change and then raise fast with the hopes the market is there.   Objectively, I think your baby is gonna die.

01:03:10
<transcript>: Twitch I would like to just talk with you the entire time 4 hours I would sit here and talk to you all for 4 hours. I think that's how deprived of social interaction I am.

01:03:10
<transcript>: i just need

01:03:11
<transcript>: I just need on Twitch to have friends.

01:03:22
<transcript>: Is that sad? I just don't talk to people in real life. I just don't want to. Okay. So Answers is not in here. It's in Properties. And then Val.

01:03:31
<transcript>: Source is also a string, but with a capital S string. Okay, we did it. That is the shape of the thing. Properties, property. Okay.

01:03:34
<transcript>: So question model.

01:03:39
<transcript>: Question Model Adam used blonde instead of bass. What is? Blah.

01:03:42
<transcript>: Where did I use blah.

01:03:43
techsavvytravvy: literally don't have any programmer friends irl lol

01:03:50
<transcript>: I get that I have had to make or really make a conscious effort to focus on my actual job. Oh, you mean while streaming? Yeah.

01:03:52
<transcript>: It's hard.

01:03:54
camdickie: in your foo, bar and blah

01:04:07
<transcript>: The thing that helps me trav is just only streaming like half my day. I don't stream my entire day, so I always know at least the other half I'll really get something done. But for that first half when I'm streaming it's like I'm just going to expect I probably won't get anything done.

01:04:14
<transcript>: Wish me luck. It's like entering pandora. Oh, yeah. You're going into a place. It sounds awful.

01:04:22
<transcript>: This stream should be in just out in kotlin? Yeah tears? I know all we hear is rambling and keyboard flex.

01:04:30
<transcript>: Is so true. I feel like everyone in Chat. Now, all of you people are taking on dax's persona.

01:04:42
<transcript>: And flaming me a little bit more than you used to. Because zach flames me so much. It's just constant digs. Just constantly responding to criticism. It's okay. I love it. You can't defend me. We.

01:04:49
thdxr: I'm influential

01:05:01
looch94: how much is your keyboard?>

01:05:03
<transcript>: Discussed that a bit ago. By the way, I'm live on YouTube. I'm live on YouTube as well. No chat, not a single person has said a word, but there you go. I'm live on YouTube in 4k if you want to watch me in 4k, if you're like, I would love this stream a little bit more. If it were a little higher resolution, then there you go. Youtube.

01:05:03
<transcript>: adam

01:05:04
<transcript>: Adam TV.

01:05:04
<transcript>: how much

01:05:14
laytanl_: Youtube is such a bad chat experience

01:05:15
<transcript>: How much is your keyboard? You know, luch, you can't buy the Mode 80 anymore. It's a little exclusive, but when you could, I think it was like $400. I think the Mode 80 was like a $400 keyboard.

01:05:20
earholesmcgee: Enjoy your face in the morning. Keep clicky clacking

01:05:22
<transcript>: And then, like keycaps the switches, everything else? I don't know. Probably like 400, 500 at the end of the day.

01:05:22
<transcript>: well actually the

01:05:35
thdxr: @allieway level of confidence to accuracy is a bit off there

01:05:39
looch94: do you think it is worth the price?

01:05:40
<transcript>: Well, actually, the keycaps were like their own $400 Port. They might have been like, $600. You can't buy gmk dracula very easily. I have a lot of very expensive keycap sets that are very hard to find. So dracula was another one that yeah. This is probably a $1,000 keyboard, I guess probably something like that.

01:05:42
tymekdev: Aftermarket keycaps pricing is awful

01:05:43
laytanl_: YT chat is like tiktok comments, I just lose braincells looking at it

lesabotsy: Aren't you a twitch partner? I thought you weren't allowed to stream on both simultaneously if you were partner?

<transcript>: I think we're good. Oh, the string thing was. Yeah, that was case sensitive. Yeah.

01:06:07
<transcript>: Never heard of Smart News or you before 15 minutes ago. Crunchbase has public grounds for any company. Linkedin has an employee list, and I have intuition. Wow, allie, that is impressive.

<transcript>: You're like a private Detective.

01:06:12
<transcript>: The move now is to actively be raising.

01:06:12
<transcript>: pretty damn hard

01:06:13
tymekdev: @Lesabotsy I think Twitch removed that restriction

01:06:26
<transcript>: Pretty damn hard right now without a major product change or put all energy in the small amount of months left into making major product change and then raise fast with the hopes the market is there. Objectively. I think your baby is going to die.

01:06:26
<transcript>: okay

01:06:30
<transcript>: Okay. I just have to come over here now. This is too good.

01:06:35
<transcript>: Wow, allie, are you like a vc? Who are you? Allie, I need to know.

allieway: I am considering streaming soon and multi streaming was an important feature for me. What do you use - I found this and am interested:  https://github.com/aler9/rtsp-simple-server

01:06:44
<transcript>: Because no one has come in to chat and said anything like that before. So a little background on Satmus. We're eight years old. We have.

01:06:44
<transcript>: raised

01:06:48
<transcript>: Raised, I don't know, $20 million over the course of those eight years.

01:06:48
<transcript>: if you're looking

01:06:58
<transcript>: If you're looking at our funding numbers on Crutchpace. Yeah. Our Series View was a while ago, but also, we make money. We actually make money. We're almost profitable, I think.

01:06:58
<transcript>: we have

01:07:01
<transcript>: We have basically an infinite runway at this point.

01:07:01
<transcript>: and

01:07:12
<transcript>: And we're working on whole new products that will actually make money, not just ad revenue. So I think we're in pretty good financial shape. But while that analysis, are you a vc, I just need to know.

01:07:15
vimcerf: almost profitable is a lot better than most companies in 2023

01:07:17
<transcript>: What is your background? Why did you come in with all that analysis? That's too funny.

01:07:17
<transcript>: literally don't

01:07:49
<transcript>: So live. Maz, you'll see him in Chat? That's Jordan and maliro, that's Matt. We got together and had coffee. Oh, and my neighbor, Ben, he's a programmer. So I do have, like, three real life programmer friends. And Jordan, Matt, if you're listening, you're my friends. Now. We had coffee in person. We're friends. It's just how it works.

01:07:50
techsavvytravvy: wow!

01:08:06
<transcript>: In your food. Barn block. Oh, I put Fu barn block. I got you. Dax is influential. How much do you have to get? Youtube is such a bad chat experience. Yeah, I don't pay attention to it. Enjoy your face in the morning. Keep clicky clacking. Yeah, I really should type more because my keyboard sounds way too good for me to not type. You know what I mean? Listen.

01:08:07
allieway: Lmao I'm not a VC - I'm IT -> DevOps -> wanna be entrepreneur -> bold twitch commenter.

01:08:45
<transcript>: To buy keycaps when you find a really nice keycap set that you want, and then it's like, oh, you can't buy that. It's not available or you can group by it. You can preorder it. I've been on preorders for dracula for over a year, like, version two. They're doing another version of it, just like, reprinting it basically. And I think I've been on preorders for that. And botanical for, like, a year.

01:08:45

<transcript>: youtube chat

01:09:46
<transcript>: Youtube chat is like TikTok comments. I just lose brain cells looking at it. Aren't you a twitch partner? I thought you weren't allowed to stream on both simultaneously. If you're a partner, I'm not a partner, lesa, but also didn't know that I didn't know you weren't allowed to do the assignment anything. So if I do become a partner, good to know.

01:09:46

01:10:07
vimcerf: @techsavvytravvy as a protest

01:10:22
<transcript>: It's an obs plugin. Multi rtmp, or R. Yeah. Rtmp. Something like that. Multi rtmp, almost profitable, is a lot better than most companies in 2023. Yeah. We've been around a long time and we get like, I think we get like a million new inbounds from Google every single day. So we get a lot of SEO.

01:10:35
<transcript>: Traffic. Just like every long tail sports question. We're basically number one or number two on so we get a ton of inbound Google traffic now that might change. I don't know. Nothing seems certain in the world right now with AI and all that.

01:10:35
<transcript>: but sam

01:10:40
<transcript>: But samuels does okay. We get a lot of traffic on the Web. Our social does really well.

01:13:02
<transcript>: Who endurance is his strength. I am a sprinter. He is a marathoner, and he will never let sammy's die. And turns out, when a company and a product live for eight years, you get a certain amount of traction. So stat muse, if you look at our growth.

<transcript>: Going kind of nuts the last year.

01:13:21
<transcript>: Like our first five years, we might have done a million searches total over the first five years that I worked there. And then the last I mean, January. I think we did 50 million searches in January, like each month. Now we're setting new records. It's like 2 million searches a day.

01:13:28
<transcript>: It's just like you live long enough and your thing will get traction. I think that's a lot of it. I don't know.

01:13:39
<transcript>: Money and performance wise gpt api versus self hosted gpt I don't know the answer to that cryle, but I'd be curious what people would say. Which one of these are you 16 personalities.

01:13:39

01:13:44
<transcript>: Oh, I'll have to. Look. Dax, is this a different thing? It's not enneagram.

01:13:44
<transcript>: you're

01:13:46
earholesmcgee: Lets code something <3

01:13:49

01:13:49
<transcript>: nj really does say

01:13:55
<transcript>: Nj really does say sound, right? Yeah. Let's code something. You're right. Ear hose, ear holes. This is getting a little.

01:14:13
<transcript>: Out of hand with the ranting and the talking and the not doing anything. Let's actually code something. I'm curious about this. Have you ever done enneagram. Dax, I'd like to know what enneagram you are. Okay. We updated our question model. That means if we broke this mode, which is good. Now I know what to fix.

01:14:14
earholesmcgee: I love your rants but I need some keyboard clicks

01:14:17
thdxr: no I haven't I'll try

01:14:19

01:15:10
<transcript>: Index.

01:15:18
<transcript>: Is correct. Index always zero. Dax. It's always the first one is the right answer. Is that right? I need to know.

01:15:30
thdxr: no client doesn't know which is right it's shuffled

01:15:38
<transcript>: I feel like this sense has never been spoken before. You're right ear holes. That's funny. I love stuff like that in Z. Laura, I love thinking about, like, when I sneeze how many people are sneezing at that moment or that like saying a sentence. And like, has that ever literally that series of words ever been said? Or when I say a word, are other people saying that word at the same time? Like, I.

01:15:38

No client doesn't know which is right. It's shuffled. Oh, so then how do we know? Oh, we're going to have to do this differently then. Okay. We're going to have to do the is it right thing differently? That's okay. I'm just going to save that for now.

02:49:49
gitpush_gitpaid: adam is a scammer.. he is working with bill gates to take away our farms and force us into eating all this gmo fake meats

02:49:58
mono_nz: the new AS UI is good but buggy. the latest Android studio giraffe v10 doesnt show logcat which is bad. dont bother upgrading yet adam. electric eel is still maybe best

02:50:02
thdxr: gitpush makes me laugh so much

02:50:03
smilingbig: I've had some very good vegan cheese

02:50:23
camdickie: yeah but i wouldn't have found you if you were in just chatting

02:50:47
gitpush_gitpaid: @thdxr MaxLOL

02:50:51
lesabotsy: Isn't being vegan more expensive in the US?

02:51:04
thdxr: ...adam is rich

02:51:18
thdxr: TABULAH???

02:51:19

02:52:18
jokestera_e: I'm middle eastern hummus is apart of our diet

02:52:31
thdxr: should we do it on my stream lol

02:52:31
smilingbig: hummus is amazing, so easy to make as well

02:52:33
grasp5533: what's this podcast episode about

02:54:00
thdxr: yeah idt if people will join as much in "Just chatting" you're competing with people a LOT hotter than you

02:54:06

maleero: There's still a fair amount of dev discussion even if you aren't working haha

02:54:37

02:54:47
grasp5533: LOL

02:54:55
koalazub: That ‘vegan expensive’ trope is such a cop out. It’s extremely cheap living. I’ll definitely argue that as soon as you enter a vegan store there’s a massive markup. Them and organic stores are a joke

02:55:00
sasankthapa: You should try dosa if theres a restaurant there in the mountains

02:55:03

gitpush_gitpaid: because we're going to expose your scams

02:57:35
camdickie: i first saw you on twitter, but never knew you streamed, so i found you in the software and gave development

02:57:50
jokestera_e: We can work on the lars bar bar

02:57:52
jokestera_e: for fun

02:58:11
grasp5533: need 30k more adam bucks for a video call

02:58:14
madeleineofrivia: Madie is great 😂

02:58:15
thdxr: I want a just chatting stream but everyone feels bad from not working during adam's stream so they are focused on catching up on work during mine

02:58:43
thdxr: adam said Kuwait right!

02:59:16
jokestera_e: @thdxr he getting cultured before our very eyes lol

02:59:31

coolpantstv: we are all alts of Dax

03:01:18
coolpantstv: the whole chat is Dax

03:01:24
braindevnull: Etymology with Adam

03:01:35
sasankthapa: dosa is a south Indian food made with lentils, very tasty and vegan

03:02:08
camdickie: it is my last name but there is no way you know me from twitter :') im just a 200 followers randy and most of my tweets are me yelling into the void

03:02:15
smilingbig: LUL

03:02:34
dmdboi: The amount of points we spent on winning MacBooks, we could have collectively had a call with Adam

03:02:48
madeleineofrivia: I found you from your hot takes on twitter- the first one I saw was the stop saying you don’t know anything one , loved it

03:03:33
grasp5533: I'm trying to turn a webflow project into an Astro project, and I think it was a mistake

03:03:35
gitpush_gitpaid: im actually skeptical on why they wanna pause now

03:04:10
thdxr: I'm south indian believe it or not!

03:05:20
grasp5533: I love Astro.  The CSS from Webflow is a mess lol

03:05:37
dmdboi: @tymekdev this is less of a call, and more of us just distracting Adam

03:05:42
thdxr: idk after yesterday I'm not too sure about astro......

03:05:45
coolakburak: LUL

03:05:46
sasankthapa: 1 in a 100?

03:06:02
bausmeier: 1 in 10000

03:06:27
sasankthapa: uh oh

03:06:36
grasp5533: When you change the styling in Webflow it just repeats the css class later in the file, so you have a lot of repeated classes

03:06:39
mattmancodes: we already know it's a scam

03:06:55
mattmancodes: we saw the code

dmdboi: Not one of those fake scams

03:09:29

03:09:41
thdxr: you can tak ea break

03:10:09
