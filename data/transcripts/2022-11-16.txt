00:01:14
nullchefo: HeyGuys

00:01:52
barryxbtw: names jeff

00:11:20
<transcript>: Didn't know it's. That loader was gonna make it today.

00:11:20
<transcript>: struggling

00:11:22
<transcript>: Struggling.

00:11:23
<transcript>: That randomness.

00:11:26
<transcript>: Has everybody done it's Wednesday.

00:11:26
<transcript>: i don't stream on

00:11:28
<transcript>: I don't stream on Wednesdays.

00:11:28
<transcript>: but i'm streaming

00:11:30
<transcript>: But I'm streaming today.

00:11:38
<transcript>: I might just have a few hours. Might not be quite as long of a normal stream as a normal stream.

00:11:40
allcliffs: hi :)

00:11:47
allcliffs: having lunch :)

00:11:48
<transcript>: Good day to Null, Chef. Oh, Jeff, I mean, Barry. I mean.

00:11:48
<transcript>: is it jeff

00:11:50
<transcript>: Is it Jeff? Is it Berry.

00:11:50
<transcript>: the name is jeff

00:11:51
<transcript>: The name is Jeff.

00:12:06
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. All Cliffs. Hello. Having lunch. That's why I say good day because it's morning for me. But I know a lot of the people that I have here in my Chat or from Europe and other places in the world. India.

00:12:08
<transcript>: Southeast Asia.

00:12:12
<transcript>: So I know it's like bedtime for some of you.

00:12:12
<transcript>: it's lunch

00:12:18
<transcript>: It's lunchtime for some of you. It's crazy. Still blows my mind the internet.

00:12:18
<transcript>: thank

00:12:20
<transcript>: Thank you. Al Gore.

00:12:26
<transcript>: We're gonna work on AWS, some more.

00:12:26
<transcript>: and yes

00:12:28
<transcript>: And yesterday.

00:12:28
<transcript>: we're

00:12:30
cowfacedude99: about to get off work!!

00:12:36
<transcript>: We're done it for like 5 hours. And after I got off the stream, I realized cow face is about to get off work.

00:12:36
<transcript>: alright

00:12:36
<transcript>: Alright.

00:12:41
<transcript>: How you doing? Cow face.

00:12:44
<transcript>: Cafes was here some of yesterday. So yesterday. Cafe.

00:12:51
<transcript>: I spent 5 hours work on AW guess and as soon as I got off stream I was like this is dumb.

00:12:51
<transcript>: like

00:12:53
<transcript>: Like, what am I doing.

00:13:10
<transcript>: Just trying, like I've reinvent is two weeks away. Less than two weeks now, a week and a half away. I'm flying to Vegas in a week and a half. And I want this project just done before we invent. It's like, peak. Aws, excitement. This is like the most. I just want to launch AWS, let the AWS community play with it.

00:13:15
<transcript>: And I'm like rewriting it all for some reason.

00:13:15
<transcript>: i know i

00:13:21
<transcript>: I know I want to use AWS. That was a good motivation, but like there's not time. So I'm going back to T three stack.

00:13:21
<transcript>: post nexus here

00:13:22
<transcript>: Post Nexus here.

00:13:29
<transcript>: This is like a perfect Billboard for T three stack. Like just use T three stack. Just I need to stop worrying about.

00:13:32
cowfacedude99: the rewrite can wait....

00:13:42
<transcript>: Infrastructure and performance and whatever like cold starts. Don't care. The rewrite can wait exactly. Cafes. I could even start. I could do it in smaller pieces. Instead of like, I'm gonna literally start a new repo.

00:13:42
<transcript>: like

00:13:49
<transcript>: Like I could start using Dynamo if I wanted. Instead of Plantscape, which I don't know with plantscale. Boost. Maybe I don't need to use Dynamo.

00:13:49
<transcript>: but

00:13:52
<transcript>: But I could do that stuff piecemeal and not just like.

00:13:52
<transcript>: all at once

00:14:01
<transcript>: All at once, so, yeah, we got a lot of features to build. I have just so much I want to do with it. I wanted to be a leaderboard. I need to make a landing page. There's just a lot to do.

00:14:09
<transcript>: So I worked on it like a couple hours after stream. Just back to the T three stack. The original repo upgraded into Next 13.

00:14:15
<transcript>: I did some SVG Sprite stuff. So now all the images are in one big SVG Sprite.

00:14:19
<transcript>: It makes for like a one mega bundle.

00:14:19
<transcript>: like

00:14:20
<transcript>: Like.

00:14:20
<transcript>: not

00:14:37
<transcript>: Not like one. So compressed. It's like a Meg. It's like just the app bundle. So not like the Frameworks or any of the other bundles. Just the app bundle. The main bundle is like 800 uncompressed JavaScript.

00:14:41
<transcript>: Because it's full of all the SVG Sprite stuff.

00:14:51
cowfacedude99: isn't planetscale on aws?

00:14:52
<transcript>: That feels bad. So now I'm trying to figure out how can I make the SDG Sprite an external file? I'm using this webpack plugin that like, does the Sprite for you? It takes like, a.

00:14:52
<transcript>: just every time you

00:15:03
<transcript>: Just every time you import SVG, it puts it in the Sprite. I don't know. I'm gonna see if I can have it. Export it to a file. Isn't play a scalinated Bishop? Yes, versello and plant skill or both on anybs we're still using AWS.

00:15:03
<transcript>: just

00:15:07
<transcript>: Just a little less directly.

00:15:07
<transcript>: i don't think

00:15:12
<transcript>: I don't think AWS, people that play eight of you guess are gonna care what it's built on.

00:15:16
<transcript>: All right.

00:15:20
<transcript>: I got my mug today. That's.

00:15:20
<transcript>: lets me work

00:15:22
<transcript>: Lets me work while I drink.

00:15:28
<transcript>: I don't have to drink the whole thing while I talk. So we're gonna get try to it. We're just gonna get into it. Let's do it.

00:15:29
<transcript>: screen time

00:15:30
<transcript>: Screen time.

00:15:30
<transcript>: not

00:15:32
<transcript>: Not that screen.

00:15:32
<transcript>: this one

00:15:33
<transcript>: This one.

00:15:34
barryxbtw: hello

00:15:35
<transcript>: Yeah. So this is the.

00:15:42
<transcript>: This is the web pack thing. Sdg spriteloader. And then all you have to do is import.

00:15:44
shiftlessatol: you would really hate my web apps

00:15:44
<transcript>: Where am I doing it.

00:15:54
<transcript>: Once you import. Yeah, here we go. I'm importing Utils Icons, which is a module that I generate.

00:15:55
shiftlessatol: 9MB of js

00:15:59
<transcript>: A build that just exports all of these. See this.

00:16:02
<transcript>: So it exports all of the.

00:16:02
<transcript>: images

00:16:10
<transcript>: Images, all the Sugs, and then I import them all here in the app TSX file.

00:16:10
<transcript>: and then i

00:16:12
<transcript>: And then I can just reference them by their ID.

00:16:17
cowfacedude99: wow. that looks like ...

00:16:19
<transcript>: Nine megabytes of JavaScript, Dave. What? Hello, Berry. I mean, Hello.

00:16:24
<transcript>: What was it? Jen.

00:16:24
<transcript>: you should really put j

00:16:28
<transcript>: You should really put Jeff in your handle in your username if your name is Jeff.

00:16:36
<transcript>: What do you think? What do we think about this approach? I think if I could get him all into an external file, I feel a little better that they weren't in the JavaScript bundle.

00:16:49
<transcript>: Like in practice, I don't know if it makes a huge difference. Like that. S. Cg. Sprite could be cached separately from the JavaScript bundle. The JavaScript bundle is going to change a lot, so it feels good to have that. Yeah, we should definitely do that.

00:16:52
barryxbtw: i saw theo use some hack to make vercel cache images

00:16:54
<transcript>: Yeah, we should do that. So here's the thing I'm using.

00:16:57
<transcript>: I'm trying to.

00:17:00
<transcript>: Customize the webpack config to make this work.

00:17:05
<transcript>: So there's supposed to be a way that you can use options.

00:17:07
<transcript>: To.

00:17:12
<transcript>: Play music. I'm gonna do this today. Then we're gonna listen some music.

00:17:14
assertionbit: Hi there

00:17:16
<transcript>: Supposed to be.

00:17:16
<transcript>: a way

00:17:20
<transcript>: A way here where we can have it export a file extract configuration.

00:17:26
<transcript>: In the extract mode. Loader should be configured with plugin. Otherwise in error is thrown. What.

00:17:26
<transcript>: oh

00:17:27
<transcript>: Oh.

00:17:32
<transcript>: That's why it was starting this air. I should pay attention. I really should.

00:17:34
<transcript>: Oh, wait.

00:17:42
<transcript>: I guess I need to import it. I wasn't doing that. Import.

00:17:45
<transcript>: I guess comp.

00:17:49
<transcript>: Write, loader, plugin.

00:17:52
<transcript>: Wires. I think it is a follow.

00:17:52
<transcript>: cha

00:17:56
<transcript>: Chaome Hane Hi there assertion. What's going on.

00:18:10
<transcript>: Barry, you saw the Ou, some hacked Mega MC, Versaille, Cash Images. Yeah, there's a you can in your verse, L. Json. You can do cache rules like that. What am I doing here? Define next minute. Okay. Spriteloader require.

00:18:15
<transcript>: Svg Spriteloader plugin. Okay.

00:18:25
<transcript>: I really hope next shows up so he can see he had to sit here and watch me do dumb AWS stuff yesterday instead of using.

00:18:25
<transcript>: his very t

00:18:27
<transcript>: His very T three stack.

00:18:30
<transcript>: Or create T Three app.

00:18:30
<transcript>: load

00:18:31
barryxbtw: nexxel?

00:18:33
<transcript>: Loader Options Extract true.

00:18:33
<transcript>: i guess

00:18:40
<transcript>: I guess this should be instead of this plugins. This should be new Spriteloader plugin. I guess. Is that right.

00:18:44
<transcript>: I'm not a webpack guy. I don't know. Are there web pack guys.

00:18:47
<transcript>: Right.

00:18:47
<transcript>: loader play

00:18:49
<transcript>: Loader, playin.

00:18:51
<transcript>: Okay. Let's try that.

00:19:00
shiftlessatol: I hate webpack

00:19:02
<transcript>: Let's try that. Yeah. Next little.

00:19:04
allcliffs: we all are vite now

00:19:04
shiftlessatol: I made my own

00:19:07
<transcript>: Web packs the worst. Can we all agree? We hate Webpack. Sorry.

00:19:07
<transcript>: we're all

00:19:09
<transcript>: We're all Vet. Now you.

00:19:13
<transcript>: Wish I was using v.

00:19:20
<transcript>: And I am on some projects now I'm using Astronoms and projects feels good, but this one is gonna be a next project.

00:19:23
fa7c0n: hey hey how is everyone doing?

00:19:24
barryxbtw: change to vite is ez

00:19:27
<transcript>: Fail to load next disk is it requires not to find an esmodul scope. I got to use import.

00:19:27
<transcript>: alright

00:19:28
<transcript>: Alright.

00:19:29
barryxbtw: ah next

00:19:31
<transcript>: Import.

00:19:31
<transcript>: that

00:19:33
<transcript>: That.

00:19:36
<transcript>: From.

00:19:47
<transcript>: Jamie, give me some ice cream.

00:19:47
<transcript>: ice cream

00:19:49
<transcript>: Ice Cream is a cocaine.

00:19:49
<transcript>: i think

00:19:50
<transcript>: I think.

00:19:56
<transcript>: That's what that means. I did that thing where it added all the spaces.

00:20:03
<transcript>: Okay. Does that work? I just do it like that.

00:20:13
<transcript>: Hey, How's everyone doing? Welcome to Chat. Falcon. I'm gonna call you Falcon.

00:20:13
<transcript>: all

00:20:21
<transcript>: All cliff, thank you for the follow thanks to follow arou. Ariro, are you guys just trying to mess with me today with your names so hard for me to say.

00:20:24
oetziofficial: heyo 👋

00:20:25
<transcript>: Cow Hane, and a rou, a rural.

00:20:25
<transcript>: i'm just

00:20:26
cowfacedude99: I think you would have to do named import.

00:20:31
<transcript>: I'm just a hillbilly from the Ozarks and I can't say words very well.

00:20:32
fa7c0n: Hey chat does anyone have any suggestion on syncing the changes happening in mysql to elastic other than logstash. Would love some links/docs for a good architecture article. Thank you

00:20:33
<transcript>: We're doing well, Falcon, how are you doing.

00:20:37
<transcript>: Change to Veet is easy. Yeah, I'm using next.

00:20:37
<transcript>: i like

00:20:42
<transcript>: I like these here. I think you would have to do named import. Oh, what did I do.

00:20:49
<transcript>: Or module not found what did I do? Named failed to load next disc.

00:20:49
<transcript>: discine module

00:20:50
<transcript>: Discine module.

00:20:50
<transcript>: that

00:20:55
<transcript>: That imported from that? Did you mean to import that.

00:20:59
<transcript>: I don't know what.

00:21:02
<transcript>: You're saying I need to do this, like.

00:21:02
<transcript>: ys

00:21:04
fa7c0n: I am doing great @adamdotdev What are we building today?

00:21:05
barryxbtw: import { SpriteLoaderPlugin } from ...

00:21:07
juliuzs: hello, what theme you use in nvim?

00:21:08
<transcript>: Ysa word, no fluid. I've been getting faster. Cafes.

00:21:08
<transcript>: at my

00:21:11
<transcript>: At my end surround nonsense.

00:21:19
barryxbtw: sad

00:21:24
<transcript>: And it's the hey chat. Does anyone have any suggestion on syncing the changes happening in MySQL to Elastic other than Log would love some link stocks for a good architecture article.

00:21:24
<transcript>: you

00:21:29
<transcript>: You know Falcon, we're building AW, GIF. I don't know.

00:21:36
<transcript>: I don't know much about that, so I'm just. I'm still new to the MySQL like PlanetScale, world.

00:21:38
<transcript>: Like I typically.

00:21:38
<transcript>: i'm streaming

00:21:45
<transcript>: I'm streaming data from DynamoDB into some data Lake or something I don't have any experience with or into elastic search or whatever.

00:21:45
<transcript>: yeah

00:21:48
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't have experience. I'm gonna put it on chat. Does.

00:22:00
<transcript>: Hello, Julie's. Welcome to Chat. Hello. What seemed to use in the oven? It's Dracula. Is this still failing? I'm just. I'm chatting it up and still haven't gotten to build. What's the problem here.

00:22:04
<transcript>: Seem like did I cannot find module.

00:22:04
<transcript>: what

00:22:06
<transcript>: What.

00:22:06
<transcript>: what

00:22:07
<transcript>: What.

00:22:07
<transcript>: did

00:22:09
<transcript>: Did I mean to import.

00:22:09
<transcript>: that

00:22:11
cowfacedude99: you didn't run it

00:22:11
<transcript>: That.

00:22:13
<transcript>: No.

00:22:13
cowfacedude99: LUL

00:22:15
juliuzs: thanks

00:22:16
<transcript>: Should I? What.

00:22:20
<transcript>: Anyone.

00:22:21
<transcript>: Have any thoughts.

00:22:26
<transcript>: I didn't run it. Oh, are you serious? That's just the old message.

00:22:27
ttbishop: @fa7c0n you don't sync mysql to elastic, you send events to elastic at same time you send to mysql

00:22:31
<transcript>: That's hilarious, but I'm also very on brand. Oh, no, it's still failed.

00:22:37
<transcript>: Can I find module? Okay, well, let's try.

00:22:39
<transcript>: Maybe if I did.

00:22:42
<transcript>: All.

00:22:46
<transcript>: As like why can't it find that that doesn't make any sense.

00:22:46
allcliffs: typesense or meilisearch for simpler search solutions. (elastic setup alone is just sooo much to unwrap)

00:22:51
<transcript>: Right SVG Sprite loader slash plugin.

00:22:55
<transcript>: Like that should be a thing.

00:22:58
barryxbtw: look into node modules

00:23:01
barryxbtw: see the folder

00:23:05
<transcript>: You don't think my sequel is Elastic? You send a vins to Elastic at the same time you send to my sequel.

00:23:05
<transcript>: type

00:23:07
<transcript>: Types in for.

00:23:07
<transcript>: milli search

00:23:10
cowfacedude99: check if it is installed.

00:23:20
<transcript>: Milli search for simpler search solutions. The last setup line is just too much. Yeah, I hate the elastic stack. I hate all that stuff. Look into no modules. See the folder. Check if it is installed. You guys are on the same wavelength. Also the thank you for the follow. Julies.

00:23:20
<transcript>: julia

00:23:30
<transcript>: Julia's and Leo Mendesum, ESM. Does your aunt? Is your name in the ESM? Or are you, like, a fanboy of Node Module systems.

00:23:34
<transcript>: Or fan girl.

00:23:34
<transcript>: okay

00:23:41
<transcript>: Okay, let's take a look at node modules. They say they say we should peek into known modules.

00:23:41
<transcript>: i guess

00:23:43
<transcript>: I guess I don't have them visible.

00:23:47
<transcript>: Let's do this code.

00:23:49
<transcript>: Playground.

00:23:50
fa7c0n: @ttbishop I kind of stuck with that option right now. I agree that pushing events is much cleaner but with the way things are I need a way to listen to changes in MySQL and update elastic.

00:23:51
<transcript>: Aw guess.

00:23:51
<transcript>: node modules

00:23:53
<transcript>: Node, modules.

00:23:55
<transcript>: And what's it called.

00:23:59
<transcript>: What was it.

00:24:06
barryxbtw: svg sprite loader

00:24:07
<transcript>: sdg spriteloader what is going on this should not be the hard part of what we're doing today

00:24:13
<transcript>: Svg Spriteloader. It's a it's a one of those.

00:24:15
<transcript>: Link.

00:24:18
<transcript>: You know.

00:24:18
<transcript>: symbolic

00:24:21
<transcript>: Symbolic link. Why would it be that.

00:24:21
<transcript>: wait what

00:24:25
<transcript>: Wait, what? Oh, I'm using PMPM. Wait, what.

00:24:30
<transcript>: Why is that? That.

00:24:36
<transcript>: Let's see. Pmpm. Sug spriteloader.

00:24:41
<transcript>: Y does it do that? Pmpm? Why do you do that? Pnpm.

00:24:41
<transcript>: is that

00:24:43
<transcript>: Is that the reason this isn't working.

00:24:53
<transcript>: Do you see the directory? It's in it's in node modules. Pnpm SDG Spriteloader at six. Maybe I'm gonna blow away node modules and reinstall. How about that.

00:24:53
<transcript>: how we

00:24:53
barryxbtw: remove node modules and install again maybe

00:24:54
<transcript>: How we feel about that.

00:24:57
<transcript>: Let's do it.

00:25:00
<transcript>: I may have mixed I don't think I mix.

00:25:03
<transcript>: Managers on this project. Sometimes I do that.

00:25:06
<transcript>: Mpm install.

00:25:10
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. Barry, you're on the same page.

00:25:26
<transcript>: Let's see, I kind of stuck with that option right now. I agree that pushing events as much cleaner, but with the way things are, I need a way to listen to changes in my sequel and update Elastic. Yeah. I found out that like playing Scale doesn't support any kind of triggers or streaming, like getting the events out.

00:25:26
<transcript>: of your thing

00:25:27
<transcript>: Of your thing.

00:25:27
<transcript>: i'm

00:25:32
<transcript>: I'm used to that with Dynamo. Like we have that in Dynamo.

00:25:32
<transcript>: pmp

00:25:36
<transcript>: Pmpm. Run, Dev? Is that what I was trying to do? Yeah.

00:25:36
<transcript>: it's failing

00:25:40
<transcript>: It's failing hard. Did you mean to import that.

00:25:40
<transcript>: i know

00:25:43
<transcript>: I know I really didn't, but I could try that.

00:25:47
<transcript>: This is gonna look terrible. If this is what we have to do.

00:25:50
<transcript>: Would be pretty sad.

00:25:57
<transcript>: What.

00:26:02
<transcript>: Now I'm recording. What is? What.

00:26:09
<transcript>: Is going on there we go.

00:26:12
<transcript>: Okay, tough start.

00:26:13
<transcript>: From.

00:26:14
ttbishop: I didn't even know mysql has that sort of API

00:26:15
<transcript>: Nope.

00:26:15
<transcript>: didn't copy it

00:26:15
barryxbtw: gotta go pickup a laptop sleeve real quick, good luck lol

00:26:17
<transcript>: Didn't copy it.

00:26:20
<transcript>: Okay new approach.

00:26:24
<transcript>: Let's see didn't even know.

00:26:24
<transcript>: my sequel

00:26:29
<transcript>: My sequel has that sort of API got a go pick up a laptop sleeve real quick. Good luck. Thanks, Barry.

00:26:31
<transcript>: I appreciate it.

00:26:40
<transcript>: Let's see. So this was actually working before I started trying to do the extract mode. That's when things fell over.

00:26:46
joostschuur: I had a pnpm issue the other day with prisma and serverless framework in a workspace and an issue recommend node-linker=hoisted. Not sure if relevant here

00:26:48
shn4ke: primeagenHeyy

00:26:48
<transcript>: And it's because it says, right here, you've got to do this. Can I make it where requires require is allowed.

00:26:53
<transcript>: I do the thing is there like a setting and neck Conf or something. Or next.

00:26:53
<transcript>: config

00:26:54
<transcript>: Config.

00:26:54
<transcript>: where i

00:26:56
<transcript>: Where I can turn on.

00:26:59
<transcript>: Require? Yeah.

00:26:59
<transcript>: is there a setting

00:27:02
<transcript>: Is there a setting for that? Maybe.

00:27:08
<transcript>: Or is it just in my TS config? Wait, is this a TS config thing.

00:27:08
<transcript>: that one

00:27:11
<transcript>: That one wouldn't be a Tsconficting, right.

00:27:14
<transcript>: Or what.

00:27:16
<transcript>: I don't know.

00:27:19
<transcript>: I don't know things.

00:27:24
<transcript>: I'm already in my yeah, I'm already in here.

00:27:26
<transcript>: Choir.

00:27:28
cowfacedude99: don't think it is a good idea though

00:27:28
<transcript>: Okay.

00:27:31
<transcript>: Next.

00:27:31
<transcript>: what's

00:27:33
<transcript>: What's not a good idea.

00:27:34
shiftlessatol: "tough start" this should be an A.D merch ite

00:27:37
<transcript>: You don't think it's a good idea, okay, so we shouldn't be doing.

00:27:42
<transcript>: Tough start should be a merch item.

00:27:42
<transcript>: i had

00:27:44
shiftlessatol: m

00:27:45
<transcript>: I had a Pnpm issue the other day.

00:27:48
<transcript>: With Prisma. It's juice.

00:27:48
<transcript>: and serverless

00:27:51
<transcript>: And Serverless Serverless Framework in a workspace.

00:27:58
<transcript>: And an issue recommended notes. Linker hoisted. Oh, yeah? That's the like make it act like all the other ones.

00:27:58
<transcript>: yeah

00:28:02
<transcript>: Yeah, we could do that. I think you lose some of the benefits of Pnpm that way.

00:28:09
<transcript>: A snake? What's going on? Snake.

00:28:14
<transcript>: Interesting interesting.

00:28:14
<transcript>: i don't

00:28:17
<transcript>: I don't know what the best thing to do here is.

00:28:20
<transcript>: Import.

00:28:24
<transcript>: From.

00:28:26
<transcript>: That.

00:28:26
shn4ke: chillin learning go hbu

00:28:31
<transcript>: And that doesn't work.

00:28:33
<transcript>: And just do that.

00:28:33
<transcript>: i would be

00:28:35
<transcript>: I would be too easy.

00:28:38
<transcript>: What.

00:28:48
<transcript>: 's Just do this.

00:28:53
<transcript>: Are you I was gonna try and import like they said.

00:28:56
shiftlessatol: you wanting to use this package manager still?

00:29:02
<transcript>: Let's just do like this.

00:29:02
fa7c0n: @ttbishop got it thank you for the help

00:29:09
<transcript>: Okay.

00:29:09
<transcript>: come on

00:29:12
<transcript>: Come on. No Emmy. Nope.

00:29:19
<transcript>: It's actually in a PMPM directory. I don't know what that's about. Svg spryloader. Let's just look on their repo. Maybe.

00:29:22
<transcript>: Let's say.

00:29:25
<transcript>: What was the air? Can I find package.

00:29:28
joostschuur: Hello. Yeah, been struggling to get all that working in a monorepo and not quite there yet (Next.js and Serverless sharing a Prisma setup)

00:29:32
<transcript>: I mean, this sounds like not a thing that would be.

00:29:38
<transcript>: Next yes. Can I find my module.

00:29:46
<transcript>: Sorry, no, no.

00:29:46
<transcript>: today

00:29:47
<transcript>: Today.

00:29:51
<transcript>: Can I. Here we go. Phil's. A little Peck. Five.

00:29:55
rudixworld: you want to use next's Image module I guess ... if you put all in /static no unnecessary code will be in output .js

00:29:56
<transcript>: It's a different error. But and they're also doing.

00:29:59
<transcript>: Required. I don't know if that's different.

00:30:07
<transcript>: Maybe I should searching this repo. Next. Js.

00:30:19
cowfacedude99: https://github.com/JetBrains/svg-sprite-loader/tree/master/examples

00:30:19
<transcript>: You wanting to use.

00:30:23
<transcript>: Chillin learning how about you.

00:30:23
<transcript>: yeah

00:30:30
<transcript>: Yeah. Learn. Maybe learning. I don't know. Have I learned anything yet? Probably not. I'm hoping to lend something soon about webpack.

00:30:37
<transcript>: Let's see. Been struggling to get all that working in a Monterefo. Not quite there yet. Make sure some serverless sharing your prison setup. Yeah, that sounds.

00:30:43
<transcript>: Tough. I definitely done next. Js and CDK stuff together at a Mona Rico.

00:30:46
<transcript>: But it was a lot of pain.

00:30:47
<transcript>: You're.

00:30:47
<transcript>: nexus imag

00:30:56
<transcript>: Nexus Image module. I guess if you put all in static, no unnecessary code will be output and generate. Oh, Rudyx, so that's how I had it. So we were.

00:31:16
<transcript>: We were just doing like individual SVGs. I just don't want there to be for devices that maybe don't have super fast internet. I don't want to be downloading each image for each round of the game separately because then I don't know if it takes 3 seconds for it to download for your client. You've lost 3 seconds of gameplay. You know, I'm saying it needs to be.

00:31:16
<transcript>: like the images

00:31:28
<transcript>: Like, the images are loaded immediately, and I think the best way to do that is to have them in, like, preloaded pre downloaded. I don't like them in the JS bundle. That's what we're trying to solve. We're trying to put them in a separate SDG Sprite file.

00:31:28
<transcript>: and

00:31:31
<transcript>: And we're hoping to do that with this plugin.

00:31:31
<transcript>: does that make sense

00:31:32
<transcript>: Does that make sense.

00:31:41
<transcript>: Cafes. Or what is this? Examples. Oh, examples.

00:31:55
<transcript>: Let's see what Cafe sent us here.

00:31:55
<transcript>: example

00:31:57
<transcript>: Examples browser.

00:31:59
<transcript>: Serverside rendering.

00:32:03
<transcript>: Brad Browser Sprite.

00:32:06
<transcript>: Extract mode.

00:32:09
<transcript>: So I think all these webpack configs are gonna look like.

00:32:13
<transcript>: Not the way that mine is going to look right.

00:32:18
<transcript>: Like, oh, they're still saying, Loader, is that.

00:32:22
<transcript>: Oh, they're saying plugins. Oh, I can just add it as a plugin like that. Maybe.

00:32:22
<transcript>: let's try

00:32:24
<transcript>: Let's try that syntax. At least.

00:32:26
<transcript>: Okay. Undo.

00:32:31
<transcript>: So let's try that syntax. Let's say config.

00:32:31
<transcript>: config

00:32:33
shn4ke: @joostschuur i don't know if you're using turborepo but they just updated docs

00:32:33
<transcript>: Config that plugin.

00:32:33
<transcript>: set it

00:32:34
<transcript>: Set it.

00:32:38
<transcript>: And so the module plugins.

00:32:41
<transcript>: Push new.

00:32:47
<transcript>: Sprite loader plugin. And then here, this would just be I think this is more correct.

00:32:57
<transcript>: Think that's more correct. This would be SVG spriteloader.

00:33:02
<transcript>: I don't think it's gonna work. I think our problem is an import problem, but.

00:33:02
<transcript>: that's

00:33:05
<transcript>: That's seems more correct than what we were doing.

00:33:07
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:33:07
<transcript>: i

00:33:12
foobfoob: is the work on bitter finished?

00:33:12
<transcript>: I don't know if you're using Turbo APO, but they just updated docs.

00:33:29
<transcript>: Is the work on Bitter. Finish? No food. We're gonna get back to Bitter. I just wanted to finish this project before reenact, which is in a week and a half now and I realized I should probably. I was waiting on a bunch of support. Tickets are still like three of them that aren't resolved.

00:33:29
<transcript>: so they did

00:33:35
<transcript>: So they did just enable where I can use global tables in my account with the increased ReadWrite capacity.

00:33:35
<transcript>: but

00:33:36
foobfoob: ok, thanks

00:33:52
<transcript>: But I still need a couple other tickets to Land, and I didn't want to keep building until I knew I could finish the thing. And we're gonna do that after Reinvent. So Reinvents here. In a couple weeks, when I get back from Reinvent, we'll go back to the Bitter Project, try to get a Twitter API doing Crazy volume.

00:33:52
<transcript>: okay

00:33:56
<transcript>: Okay, let's see. Sz? Spriteloader.

00:34:01
<transcript>: What we need is.

00:34:10
<transcript>: Next JS, next JS SVG Sprite loader. Maybe somebody's done this out in the wild somewhere.

00:34:13
<transcript>: Next is you sprites? What.

00:34:17
shiftlessatol: " ...tickets to land " but what about tickets to ride?

00:34:24
<transcript>: 's.

00:34:29
<transcript>: If anybody had any help on this.

00:34:38
<transcript>: So what is this? Generate SUG sprites from import files. You can SUG spriteloader. Oh, oh, it is. This is the next project.

00:34:41
<transcript>: Yes. What next? With plugins.

00:34:44
<transcript>: What.

00:34:48
<transcript>: Really does this work.

00:34:52
<transcript>: Standalone with SUG sprites.

00:34:59
<transcript>: I I feel like this is what I want.

00:35:02
<transcript>: But.

00:35:04
<transcript>: Wait a minute.

00:35:08
<transcript>: I have to install.

00:35:08
<transcript>: next

00:35:10
<transcript>: Next SUG sprites.

00:35:15
<transcript>: And where does Nexus? Do you spritz? Come? Okay here with plugins.

00:35:22
<transcript>: Or just standalone. So if we do standalone with SUG sprites. Next SUG sprites.

00:35:22
<transcript>: and then

00:35:24
<transcript>: And then we say like that.

00:35:27
<transcript>: So what they're saying to me right now.

00:35:27
khoulyy: is this dark mode in chrome ?

00:35:30
<transcript>: Second work.

00:35:37
<transcript>: Next, we're plugins. What's that.

00:35:39
<transcript>: That feels like another piece. I don't need.

00:35:41
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't need that.

00:35:47
<transcript>: Okay. So standalone. Let's try this. Let's add this thing. Why not.

00:35:50
<transcript>: Mpm, add.

00:35:58
<transcript>: Okay, unmet peerDependency. Next at twelve.

00:36:03
<transcript>: Well, we're using 13. We'll see if this works.

00:36:05
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:36:05
<transcript>: and now we're gonna say

00:36:10
<transcript>: And now we're gonna say, with SVG sprites. So I have to, like, wrap my whole config with this.

00:36:10
<transcript>: feels

00:36:12
<transcript>: Feels unnecessary.

00:36:13
shiftlessatol: if you like your eyes, you will like dark mode in everything

00:36:22
<transcript>: And feels kind of like strange, but okay, remember back to just peak this thing's code and see the answers to my questions. What do we think.

00:36:22
<transcript>: is this

00:36:25
<transcript>: Is this dark mode in Chrome.

00:36:25
<transcript>: no it's just

00:36:28
<transcript>: No, it's just a dark mode on GitHub. I think.

00:36:32
allcliffs: @adamdotdev maybe svgr with custom template would work ?

00:36:36
<transcript>: If you like your eyes you like Dark mode and everything.

00:36:36
<transcript>: maybe svg

00:36:41
<transcript>: Maybe Svgr with custom template would work. What is this? What is SVG? Are.

00:36:43
<transcript>: Was that.

00:36:46
<transcript>: I want to look at what this thing does.

00:36:49
<transcript>: Require the plugin.

00:36:52
<transcript>: Fix rules to.

00:36:52
<transcript>: declar

00:36:54
<transcript>: Declarations.

00:37:00
<transcript>: Well, first of all, how are they able to ambulance like that? I think my problem is Pnpm probably.

00:37:07
<transcript>: Pmpm SVG Sprite loader.

00:37:12
allcliffs: https://react-svgr.com/

00:37:13
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:37:22
<transcript>: I guess I didn't check in that repo to see if anybody said anything about PMPM.

00:37:23
webdev33: Thats just standard common js modules

00:37:25
shiftlessatol: + import not found

00:37:31
<transcript>: Let's just standard common JS modules. Yeah, I can't seem to use those in next 13.

00:37:31
<transcript>: things of the follow

00:37:33
<transcript>: Things of the follow yields.

00:37:38
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Webdev. 33.

00:37:41
<transcript>: So.

00:37:43
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:37:48
<transcript>: I could do the pnpm hoist thing.

00:37:48
<transcript>: we could do that

00:37:50
<transcript>: We could do that.

00:37:50
<transcript>: let's just do

00:37:51
<transcript>: Let's just do that.

00:38:03
<transcript>: Like at least I'm still using PMPM in the CLI. So I'm keeping building up more muscle memory. But I feel like I should probably just let's just do it. Pmpm, no hoist or whatever.

00:38:09
<transcript>: Shame, shamefully, hoist, is that what is.

00:38:20
<transcript>: Exclude patterns from Hoisting. Oh, okay.

00:38:20
<transcript>: in npm

00:38:22
<transcript>: In npmrc.

00:38:22
<transcript>: this

00:38:24
<transcript>: This sounds promising.

00:38:30
<transcript>: We want MPM, RC.

00:38:35
<transcript>: And I can say.

00:38:35
<transcript>: hoist

00:38:39
<transcript>: Hoist pattern. Who thinks this is gonna work? Anybody.

00:38:40
webdev33: Keyboard sounds pretty good -- what are the specs?

00:38:42
<transcript>: Let's say.

00:38:45
<transcript>: Not.

00:38:45
<transcript>: it's

00:38:46
<transcript>: It's.

00:38:46
<transcript>: br

00:38:48
shiftlessatol: hard no

00:38:48
<transcript>: Bright, loader.

00:38:52
<transcript>: I think that's gonna work done. You put wildcards around it.

00:38:58
v0sn: damn, havent been here in a while, but your nvim setup turned out quite nicely

00:38:59
<transcript>: Do you think this is gonna work.

00:39:06
<transcript>: We're actually gonna look at the node modules before I even move forward.

00:39:15
<transcript>: Okay.

00:39:15
<transcript>: svg

00:39:17
<transcript>: Svg spriteloader.

00:39:20
<transcript>: No, what? This is all. What.

00:39:20
<transcript>: they're all

00:39:25
<transcript>: They're all in there, so I didn't didn't do what I wanted it to do.

00:39:32
<transcript>: I don't understand why? Why is this a problem for.

00:39:35
<transcript>: Like it's not a problem when I import.

00:39:35
<transcript>: any of these

00:39:36
webdev33: Using finder to view folders? Broskie this is why vim is so bad

00:39:40
<transcript>: Any of these things elsewhere in the project. So why is it a problem.

00:39:46
shiftlessatol: at this point, you could just make your own guess game

00:39:49
<transcript>: Using Finder to view folders brisket this is why they miss so bad I could view the folders.

00:39:49
<transcript>: i just would have to make

00:39:50
<transcript>: I just would have to make.

00:39:50
<transcript>: a

00:39:52
<transcript>: A probably a ton.

00:39:52
<transcript>: of inventory

00:40:01
<transcript>: Of inventory setting change, and I didn't want to, but right now I do have node modules hidden in my I mean, you can do the same thing in vs. Code, right.

00:40:03
<transcript>: You can hide them.

00:40:06
<transcript>: Keyboard sounds pretty good. What are the specs.

00:40:06
<transcript>: it is

00:40:09
<transcript>: It is a.

00:40:09
<transcript>: mode signing

00:40:12
<transcript>: Mode Signing with mode Signal switches.

00:40:12
<transcript>: lubed

00:40:18
<transcript>: Lubed by the fine folks at Mode having been here in a while, but you're in Vim set up turned out quite nicely. Thanks.

00:40:22
<transcript>: thanksgame

00:40:23
<transcript>: Thanksgame.

00:40:23
<transcript>: okay

00:40:25
<transcript>: Okay.

00:40:25
<transcript>: so

00:40:26
<transcript>: So.

00:40:35
<transcript>: Voice pattern. Let's just do the shamefully voice thing. Pmpm, PM, Shamefully, hoist.

00:40:38
<transcript>: Just I might just start using yarn at some point here.

00:40:39
murrrrrphy: HeyGuys

00:40:48
<transcript>: I don't understand why this is the case for this particular module, and not for.

00:40:52
<transcript>: When I do imports elsewhere in the project, I don't understand.

00:40:58
<transcript>: Who can tell me? Do I shamefully I just do it like this.

00:40:58
<transcript>: like pm

00:40:59
webdev33: Pnpm doesnt seam to work half the time for me too

00:41:00
<transcript>: Like PMPM. Install.

00:41:04
<transcript>: Pmpm install Shamefully, hoist.

00:41:14
<transcript>: That worked.

00:41:16
<transcript>: And delete that now.

00:41:21
<transcript>: Let's see. Where was I.

00:41:21
<transcript>: digging

00:41:24
<transcript>: Digging so we're import.

00:41:25
<transcript>: importer plugin

00:41:29
<transcript>: Importer plugin. We're doing this plugins push, just like this. Okay.

00:41:31
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:41:35
<transcript>: Love to get past this.

00:41:41
<transcript>: Import as we try this so it's still not working. And did the shamefully voice not work? Maybe not.

00:41:45
<transcript>: Maybe not.

00:41:50
<transcript>: Oh, Wait. Now these are all SIM links.

00:41:55
<transcript>: Should I just use yarn? Is it just time to use yarn? And it.

00:42:03
<transcript>: Pmpm issue. I don't know that it's a PMPM issue, but it feels like a Pnpm issue.

00:42:04
<transcript>: Svg.

00:42:04
<transcript>: spriteloader

00:42:06
<transcript>: Spriteloader.

00:42:06
<transcript>: they're all

00:42:08
<transcript>: They're all in this PMPM directory.

00:42:13
shiftlessatol: https://blog.novacare.no/autogenerate-svg-sprite-with-webpack-and-svg-sprite-loader/

00:42:16
<transcript>: But I feel like that's how that's how PMPM works. And it works for all my other imports. So I don't understand.

00:42:24
webdev33: thats how pnpm works tho...

00:42:24
<transcript>: Okay, here's some of the autogenerate SUG Sprite. Bloodpacket. Sug spriteloader yet? Yeah, that's what I'm doing, Dave.

00:42:27
joostschuur: The really frustrating part for me is several times now I've seen issues that say 'yeah, that doesn't work with pnpm, PRs welcome' from over a year ago and no solutions

00:42:28
<transcript>: My issues are more specific than that.

00:42:43
<transcript>: Yeah, that's how PMPM works and I don't understand why I can't import from this file specifically for Next JS Next config MJS. I feel like is this a TS config issue because I am importing from TypeScript files elsewhere.

00:42:43
<transcript>: in my next

00:42:46
<transcript>: In my next config file is like an ESM module.

00:42:47
shiftlessatol: that is a good

00:42:48
<transcript>: Is that the issue.

00:42:48
<transcript>: like if i

00:42:52
shiftlessatol: you should view the link

00:42:52
<transcript>: Like if I tried the import, let's try and import something else from my import.

00:42:55
<transcript>: What other.

00:42:55
<transcript>: like

00:42:56
<transcript>: Like.

<transcript>: Let's go in here. Just. I'm just gonna take it import.

00:43:05
allcliffs: or is this nextjs issue LUL

00:43:07
<transcript>: from here so what if i import use machine for here yeah

00:43:09
<transcript>: So what if I did this.

00:43:10
joostschuur: And then when I try yarn, I get different errors

00:43:13
<transcript>: Does that fail.

00:43:17
shiftlessatol: they use yarn

00:43:22
<transcript>: Failed to load. Can I find module.

00:43:25
<transcript>: Okay, let me comment. That one out.

00:43:38
<transcript>: So it doesn't seem like this is failing. Let's use machine.

00:43:41
<transcript>: This import, right.

00:43:48
<transcript>: Let's try that.

00:43:52
<transcript>: Do you use your.

00:43:59
<transcript>: Next JS issue? I don't know, I don't know.

00:44:03
<transcript>: All I know is it's an issue.

00:44:06
<transcript>: I don't know who's issue.

00:44:06
<transcript>: oof

00:44:08
<transcript>: Oof.

00:44:10
<transcript>: What is all this.

00:44:10
shiftlessatol: the link I sent

00:44:12
shiftlessatol: module.exports = {     ...     module: {      rules: [             {                 test: /\.svg$/,                 use: "svg-sprite-loader"             },             ...  ]     },     ... }

00:44:14
webdev33: What do you need the sprite loader for?

00:44:19
<transcript>: Okay.

00:44:25
<transcript>: Let's.

00:44:32
rudixworld: I was creating this popular Facebook game like 5+ years ago ... to preload next profile pic I was just hiding it in div lolz

00:44:38
shiftlessatol: # NPM  npm install svg-sprite-loader -D

00:44:39
<transcript>: Be clear I can use SVG spriteloader. I just can't seem to use it in the extract mode, but I was able to use it.

00:44:46
<transcript>: In the default. Like the normal way. Oh, yeah. I was gonna try this. I stopped going down this path.

00:44:46
<transcript>: here

00:44:48
<transcript>: Here.

00:44:48
<transcript>: next sat

00:44:51
<transcript>: Next sat sprites. I guess we can give this a chance.

00:44:51
<transcript>: it's weird to me

00:44:53
<transcript>: It's weird to me that we have to.

00:44:58
<transcript>: Oh, Es module is a what.

00:45:01
<transcript>: Oh, that's for the output or something.

00:45:04
<transcript>: Okay.

00:45:04
<transcript>: it's weird

00:45:09
<transcript>: It's weird to me that I have to wrap my whole config in this thing, but I'm willing.

00:45:13
<transcript>: So I don't import this thing at all.

00:45:18
<transcript>: Instead, I import with SVG sprites.

00:45:21
<transcript>: Equals require.

00:45:24
<transcript>: Next I can't do require.

00:45:24
<transcript>: import

00:45:25
<transcript>: Import from.

00:45:31
<transcript>: Next SVG sprites. Okay. And then down here.

00:45:33
<transcript>: We're going to return.

00:45:33
<transcript>: no

00:45:34
<transcript>: No.

00:45:36
<transcript>: Find next config.

00:45:40
<transcript>: We're gonna actually do.

00:45:43
<transcript>: With SVG sprites.

00:45:43
<transcript>: and then we're gonna

00:45:46
<transcript>: And then we're gonna have that config.

00:45:48
<transcript>: Followed by.

00:45:49
shiftlessatol: is this what you want?

00:45:51
shiftlessatol: This will create a sprite within your bundled *.js file. The svg-sprite-loader transforms each imported SVG to a symbol within the sprite that has a unique id. By default this id is the same as the SVG filename.  Now you can import all the SVG's you need into your code and use them within an SVG tag with the SVG's id:

00:45:53
<transcript>: That and this is our so I'm going to do any of this.

00:46:00
<transcript>: Take the options.

00:46:08
webdev33: wait ur the nerd that built public.dev?

00:46:12
<transcript>: I'm gonna do like this.

00:46:14
webdev33: super cool stuff man!

00:46:19
<transcript>: Does that look right.

00:46:22
<transcript>: I think that's what they're saying. I do.

00:46:25
<transcript>: Just like.

00:46:25
<transcript>: get rid of

00:46:29
<transcript>: Get rid of all the custom web pack and they do it for me. Allegedly.

00:46:33
<transcript>: Pmpm rundev. I don't know. We'll see.

00:46:37
<transcript>: I know. Weird output. That's a good start.

00:46:39
<transcript>: Good start.

00:46:48
<transcript>: Okay. It runs. Also a good start. Let's see. Did we get a separate.

00:46:51
<transcript>: Did we get a separate SVG.

00:46:54
<transcript>: No.

00:46:58
<transcript>: Now Main TS still has all the SVGs in it, doesn't it.

00:47:11
<transcript>: Or does it? I don't even know. I don't see the Sugs in here. This might just be okay. Let's try. Let's just try. Let's start it. Let's see.

00:47:14
<transcript>: Ah should not import. What is that.

00:47:14
<transcript>: should not

00:47:19
<transcript>: Should not import the name to export filter. Okay, so something's broken? Broken.

00:47:25
<transcript>: Only default export is available soon.

00:47:31
<transcript>: Okay. I think that library is best.

00:47:31
<transcript>: i think

00:47:33
<transcript>: I think I don't want to use it.

00:47:36
<transcript>: Lots of things broken here.

00:47:40
<transcript>: Are these are worn. These are warnings on the server.

00:47:46
<transcript>: Have I just noticed these before? Maybe not.

00:47:52
<transcript>: You're the nerd that built public ideas. That's right. Web Dev.

00:47:52
<transcript>: i am that

00:47:54
<transcript>: I am that nerd.

00:47:54
<transcript>: this is what

00:47:55
<transcript>: This is what you want.

00:48:03
<transcript>: What? Svg. Spriteloader. What? They've already inserted. This will create a Sprite within your bundle. This. Yeah, I've already done this.

00:48:11
<transcript>: Let me let me all I didn't. I realized I didn't start the stream showing you all what I did have working. So let me show you what I did have working.

00:48:14
<transcript>: I had it working. Just fine.

00:48:20
<transcript>: Okay. So I'm just going to comment that out and down here. We're just gonna say.

00:48:20
<transcript>: like this

00:48:22
<transcript>: Like this.

00:48:22
<transcript>: okay

00:48:23
<transcript>: Okay.

00:48:23
<transcript>: so i

00:48:26
<transcript>: So I have this working.

00:48:32
<transcript>: With Sprite. It's an SUG Sprite. It's just in the JS bundle. Okay.

00:48:34
<transcript>: So watch this.

00:48:40
<transcript>: So that image is coming out of the SVG Sprite. It's no longer.

00:48:43
<transcript>: Time stream. It's no longer.

00:48:43
<transcript>: bundled

00:48:49
<transcript>: Bundled. Or. I'm sorry. It's no longer. Oh, wow. Is that really that logo? Is it really like that.

00:48:49
<transcript>: or did

00:48:52
<transcript>: Or did it distort it? It might have just sorted it.

00:48:52
<transcript>: work now

00:48:53
<transcript>: Work now.

00:48:57
<transcript>: About to look at the work mail and see if that is right.

00:48:57

00:49:04
<transcript>: Chime Voice Connector OOH I'm on a roll streak three in a row cloud watch OOH for in a row haven't this one yet.

00:49:11
<transcript>: I don't know what this is. I'm gonna say fence base, because it's like a financial building. I don't know.

00:49:11
<transcript>: that is

00:49:13
<transcript>: That is Athena. I know that one.

00:49:18
<transcript>: Cloud map.

00:49:18
<transcript>: looks

00:49:25
<transcript>: Looks like a map in a cloud. We're still doing good. Ooh, I know this one. Simple notifications are SNS.

00:49:31

00:50:02
<transcript>: You get 5 seconds every time you get one right and you get the number of points of your oh, what is this.

00:50:21
<transcript>: Oh, I'm just gonna I'm just gonna lose at the end. Okay. You get the number of points of your current streak every time you get one on your streak. So if you're on a if you've got twelve in a row, you get twelve points. 13 in a row. That's 13 point. It's like it goes kind of exponentially, you know? I mean, okay, so that's what the sugar sprites. The problem is.

00:50:21
<transcript>: it

00:50:28
logeshsiva: Hi, Adam

00:50:36
<transcript>: It's all in the main JS bundle, and I want it in separate files. Well, I went in one separate big SDG Sprite, so that's download and cached independently of the JavaScript bundle. Otherwise, every time I make a change to the app, that JavaScript bundle is going to change.

00:50:36
<transcript>: and the

00:50:40
developmentrobot: did the state machine simplify the state management for this?

00:50:42
<transcript>: And the browser isn't going to have all the sprites cashed. So I need it. I need it to be external. You know, I'm saying.

00:50:45
logeshsiva: what are you building ?

00:50:47
<transcript>: Hi, there, Logash. Welcome to chat.

00:50:47
<transcript>: did the

00:50:58
<transcript>: Did the state machine simplify the state manager for this? It did develop in a robot. I love the state machine. We'll look at some Xace today because I got some changes I need to make. What do you build it's? Aw. Guess.

00:50:58
<transcript>: and

00:50:59
adamdotdev: !awguess

00:50:59
fossabot: awguess is a guessing game where you're given an AWS service icon and you have to choose the correct service! https://github.com/adamelmore/awguess

00:51:04
<transcript>: And it's I'm trying to finish it up for reinventing. It's gonna have a leaderboard and people can play.

00:51:04
<transcript>: and like trying

00:51:06
<transcript>: And like trying to get high school or is that kind of thing.

00:51:18
<transcript>: Do we want to try? Don't want to try a yarn? Don't just see if that works. I can always go back.

00:51:21
<transcript>: I can always go back, right.

00:51:24
<transcript>: I'm running piececale.

00:51:35
<transcript>: So let's try yarn, let's just try if I just delete PMPM lock.

00:51:40
<transcript>: And then if I just remove.

00:51:40
<transcript>: node

00:51:42
<transcript>: Node models.

00:51:47
<transcript>: Just like that. Now let's do yarn, install.

00:51:59
<transcript>: See if we can get this thing working.

00:52:10
<transcript>: Outside of Pnpm world. Like if it's a problem with the way Pnpm does.

00:52:10
<transcript>: their thing

00:52:11
<transcript>: Their thing.

00:52:15
<transcript>: Right. I think for the follow Lagash.

00:52:18
<transcript>: Hit that look at lagsh.

00:52:22
<transcript>: Let me know if I'm saying your name wrong if you'd like me to say it differently.

00:52:22
<transcript>: i try to remember

00:52:23
<transcript>: I try to remember those things.

00:52:27
shiftlessatol: this?

00:52:27
<transcript>: Pmpm, run Dev, let's see. Yarn is done inside.

00:52:27
<transcript>: okay

00:52:29
shiftlessatol: webpack 1 module.exports = {   module: {     loaders: [       {         test: /\.svg$/,         loader: 'svg-sprite-loader?runtimeCompat=true'       }     ]   } }  // webpack 2 module.exports = {   module: {     rules: [       {         test: /\.svg$/,         loader: 'svg-sprite-loader',         options: {           runtimeCompat: true         }       }     ]   } }

00:52:38
<transcript>: Okay. No failed to load. Can I find module SDG Spriteloader imported from that as you mean to import oh JS oh Oh.

00:52:40
<transcript>: It's.

00:52:40
<transcript>: it's

00:52:51
<transcript>: It's a we're in a we're in a ESM file. This is an ASM module. We have to put JS on it. Is that all it is? Would it have worked with PMPM like that.

00:52:53
<transcript>: Is that all it was.

00:52:53
<transcript>: did i just needed

00:52:57
<transcript>: Did I just needed JS on the end? I did, I just needed JS on the end, didn't I.

00:53:00
<transcript>: Is that right.

00:53:00
<transcript>: let's see

00:53:01
coolruahh: tips for making the backend of a website?

00:53:03
<transcript>: Let's see oh enter does not have.

00:53:03
<transcript>: subs

00:53:06
<transcript>: Subsets selected. I thought I selected it.

00:53:09
<transcript>: Okay.

00:53:12
<transcript>: Here we go. Let's see if it's working.

00:53:12
<transcript>: is there

00:53:15
<transcript>: Is there a separate okay? No spriteloaded.

00:53:18
<transcript>: Also, I don't see.

00:53:18
<transcript>: okay

00:53:20
<transcript>: Okay, let's try this again.

00:53:23
<transcript>: No.

00:53:26
<transcript>: Interesting so no images whatsoever.

00:53:32
<transcript>: So what did it do? I mean, it just broke my Sprite thing.

00:53:35
<transcript>: Let's try.

00:53:35
<transcript>: let's try

00:53:38
<transcript>: Let's try this. So we did this a couple different ways.

00:53:42
<transcript>: Instead of pushing the plugin here.

00:53:42
<transcript>: let's

00:53:45
<transcript>: Let's do loader.

00:53:50
<transcript>: Right. Well, that work. I don't know. We can try.

00:53:50
<transcript>: sprite

00:53:52
<transcript>: Sprite, loader plugin.

00:53:52
<transcript>: try

00:53:54
<transcript>: Try.

00:53:58
<transcript>: Can't hurt to try oh, it can it failed.

00:54:00
shiftlessatol: awguess : telekinesis

00:54:02
<transcript>: Object provided by the user. What.

00:54:05
<transcript>: Schwett.

00:54:08
<transcript>: Okay, clearly, this is not a valid.

00:54:11
<transcript>: Web Pack configuration.

00:54:18
<transcript>: Okay. Let's see define next. Config Web pack.

00:54:18
<transcript>: rule

00:54:23
<transcript>: Rules. Push loader. So not that way we found out. It's not this white people.

00:54:23
<transcript>: it's not how you do it

00:54:24
<transcript>: It's not how you do it.

00:54:28
<transcript>: How do I go back to this rep? Here we go.

00:54:30
<transcript>: Not this way.

00:54:35
<transcript>: Extract configuration. So they said, do it like this plugins.

00:54:38
<transcript>: Push the plugin like that.

00:54:40
<transcript>: And then.

00:54:49
<transcript>: Here test loader and options, but loader is going to be.

00:54:56
<transcript>: Svg? Sprite? We do this, didn't we? It didn't work. Test.

00:54:56
<transcript>: loader

00:55:03
<transcript>: Loader options. I hate Webpack so much if I mention that that I hate Webpack because I do. I hate it.

00:55:08
<transcript>: Unless you work on webpack and then I'll be really kind and say good work.

00:55:16
<transcript>: Because I'm very nonconfrontantial, but I really don't like Webback. I dislike it a lot, so we're not getting errors now.

00:55:19
<transcript>: We're just. It's just not working.

00:55:19
<transcript>: so it's just

00:55:21
<transcript>: So it's just not Loading the spray.

00:55:26
<transcript>: Is it exporting it? And I'm just not seeing it. Where does it export it by default.

00:55:30
<transcript>: Public path.

00:55:37
<transcript>: Default is webpack public path. So let's look in the I can specify an output path.

00:55:43
<transcript>: By default it will use telepath.

00:55:46
anaserror404: hello

00:55:48
<transcript>: What is webpack public path? Where would that be if I wanted to find this thing.

00:55:51
<transcript>: Bye, now.

00:55:55
anaserror404: what do you prefer windows 11 or 10

00:55:57
<transcript>: Hello, welcome to Chat. Cool, RUH.

00:55:57
<transcript>: huru

00:55:59
<transcript>: Huru.

00:56:03
<transcript>: Let's see tips for making the back end of a website.

00:56:03
<transcript>: yeah i

00:56:06
<transcript>: Yeah, I think Create T Three app is a great starting point.

00:56:11
<transcript>: You can kind of think less about backends if you want to make a website and you need some.

00:56:11
<transcript>: light

00:56:13
vagorge: what happen to bttr

00:56:15
<transcript>: Light backend Functionality it's a great place to start.

00:56:15
<transcript>: and then

00:56:17
shiftlessatol: check this out

00:56:18
shiftlessatol: extract-svg-sprite-webpack-plugin

00:56:19
<transcript>: And then you can graduate into my complicated things, like, AWS.

00:56:24
<transcript>: Anna sorrower. No.

00:56:24
<transcript>: an s error

00:56:32
<transcript>: An s error 404? Hello, welcome to Chat. What do you prefer? Windows Eleven or Ten macOS whatever version it is right now. I don't know.

00:56:32
<transcript>: i

00:56:37
<transcript>: I just. I use Mac. What happened to Bitter? It's coming, it's coming.

00:56:37
<transcript>: i just explain

00:56:47
allcliffs: but prisma doesnt support dynamodb does it ?

00:56:53
<transcript>: I just explained that I'm gonna work on it after I get back from here reinvent, but I want to get a to be guest done for reinvent extract sugar Sprite webpack plugin. What? What is this? Dave? This is so confusing. Extract SVG Sprite webpack plugin. That's a thing.

00:56:56
shiftlessatol: https://github.com/JetBrains/svg-mixer/tree/master/packages/extract-svg-sprite-webpack-plugin

00:56:58
<transcript>: Kismin doesn't support DynamoDB. No, that's right. On Clip. It doesn't. What is this.

00:57:05
<transcript>: Something similar to what I'm using right now. Just a different plugin.

00:57:10
<transcript>: First let me let me go down this track let's see if we can find.

00:57:16
<transcript>: I don't even think this was a PMPN problem, was it.

00:57:16
<transcript>: it was

00:57:21
<transcript>: It was. I didn't put JS on there. So is it in the next directory? Static.

00:57:21
<transcript>: webpack

00:57:23
<transcript>: Webpack.

00:57:23
<transcript>: no

00:57:24
<transcript>: No.

00:57:24
<transcript>: media

00:57:25
<transcript>: Media.

00:57:27
<transcript>: Fonts.

00:57:30
<transcript>: We're just looking for an SVG file right now.

00:57:35
<transcript>: In the worst possible way by literally expanding all these tree.

00:57:35
<transcript>: things

00:57:37
<transcript>: Things, servers.

00:57:41
<transcript>: I don't see any SVGs.

00:57:43
shiftlessatol: it's opposite

00:57:46
<transcript>: Don't see them.

00:57:56
<transcript>: I'm not sure where I would see it if I was going to see it. I guess we could customize the directory and see if that helps, but.

00:57:56
<transcript>: so what

00:57:58
<transcript>: So what is this? How's this different.

00:58:02
<transcript>: Sprite plugin.

00:58:09
shiftlessatol: instead of the SVG Js bundle, it's extracting into a file

00:58:13
<transcript>: How does this one differ from the one I'm using.

00:58:16
<transcript>: Oh, wait, this is also from the JetBrains. Wait, what.

00:58:20
<transcript>: Generation transform is bright and modern way.

00:58:26
<transcript>: So they have two different web pack plugins.

00:58:26
<transcript>: i'm sorry

00:58:28
<transcript>: I'm sorry. What.

00:58:36
<transcript>: I'm so confused.

00:58:40
<transcript>: Under heavy development years ago.

00:58:44
<transcript>: Okay. Jeff. Brains, what's going on here.

00:58:46
<transcript>: What's going on here.

00:59:03
<transcript>: Instead of Suga JS bundle tickshot hand file. Yeah, but, Dave, that ours. Does that too. Ours does that too. It's also from Jeff Brains. And it's I think a more recent repo now, also years ago. Well, 13 months ago, they did something.

00:59:13
<transcript>: Webpack loader for creating SVG spreads. Like, I think I think this one's what we want. It does extraction. We just don't have the extraction working.

00:59:15
<transcript>: That's all.

00:59:15
<transcript>: public pass

00:59:17
<transcript>: Public pass slash.

00:59:23
<transcript>: Let's try that.

00:59:28
<transcript>: Option.

00:59:33
<transcript>: Extract true public path.

00:59:35
<transcript>: I like that.

00:59:37
<transcript>: For Sprite.

00:59:44
<transcript>: Okay output Path Custom Dirt sprites.

00:59:48
<transcript>: Okay.

00:59:51
<transcript>: Let's see if that works.

00:59:53
<transcript>: Out yarn, dead.

01:00:08
<transcript>: I don't see any.

01:00:11
<transcript>: Don't see any sprites.

01:00:14
<transcript>: And it's not Loading.

01:00:21
<transcript>: Did it put a Sprite somewhere.

01:00:21
<transcript>: what is slack

01:00:23
<transcript>: What is Slack supposed to be.

01:00:36
<transcript>: I don't see any Sugs anywhere let's just search I guess.

01:00:44
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, there's lots of SUG.

01:00:44
<transcript>: date

01:00:46
<transcript>: Date let's do like date.

01:00:46
<transcript>: created

01:00:48
<transcript>: Created.

01:00:51
<transcript>: Logo? What.

01:00:59
<transcript>: I'm for some plugin. Okay. No, it's not creating any SVGs. It's not exporting them anyway.

01:01:03
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:01:06
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow up zoolek.

01:01:06
<transcript>: and zinj

01:01:09
<transcript>: And zinjib and buffer.

01:01:13
<transcript>: This is the.

01:01:13
<transcript>: more painful

01:01:15
<transcript>: More painful. Then I thought it'd be.

01:01:18
<transcript>: Alright, loader, plugin.

01:01:21
<transcript>: Cd Sprouter extract true.

01:01:23
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:01:28
<transcript>: Examples. We looked at those plugins.

01:01:29
<transcript>: Oh, wait.

01:01:32
<transcript>: No.

01:01:41
<transcript>: So extract doesn't seem to be I wonder if I just do I have this wrong? Is this not how rules look.

01:01:47
<transcript>: This is not how rules look.

01:01:47
<transcript>: like

01:01:50
<transcript>: Like let's look at some next shut. Yeah. Here we go.

01:01:50
<transcript>: use

01:01:54
<transcript>: Use oh so theirs looks different.

01:01:54
<transcript>: test

01:01:57
<transcript>: Test. And then use so let's try this.

01:01:57
<transcript>: test

01:01:59
<transcript>: Test use.

01:02:03
<transcript>: Then they've got.

01:02:08
<transcript>: What is that.

01:02:08
<transcript>: oh like

01:02:12
ttbishop: just the brackets

01:02:12
<transcript>: Oh, like this is one of them. So then loader.

01:02:14
<transcript>: Well here. I can just.

01:02:17
ttbishop: it's array of loaders

01:02:20
<transcript>: Like that. And then options.

01:02:22
<transcript>: Like this.

01:02:24
<transcript>: What they're saying.

01:02:30
<transcript>: Hey, you use.

01:02:38
<transcript>: Tests use let's try this. Maybe I just have the syntax wrong outside of next year. This is expectations.

01:02:40
shiftlessatol: runtimeCompat=true

01:02:42
<transcript>: I don't really understand web pack so I don't know.

01:02:42
<transcript>: but

01:02:44
<transcript>: But.

01:02:47
<transcript>: Let's try it.

01:02:51
<transcript>: No SVG.

01:03:04
<transcript>: Really leave this Finder window open. Keep opening it. Let's see if there's anything in next now. Oh, look, spy SUG look at this. Aha.

01:03:04
<transcript>: aha

01:03:06
<transcript>: Aha.

01:03:10
<transcript>: See if it actually looks like it has a heads. Our stuff in it. I don't see anything.

01:03:15
<transcript>: But I might not understand sprites. Maybe I shouldn't be able to see anything.

01:03:19
<transcript>: Maybe it's really zoomed in or really zoomed out.

01:03:23
<transcript>: Runtime compat equals true.

01:03:31
<transcript>: I think we're getting somewhere now. Now we have a separate file. I think I just need to load it differently.

01:03:31
<transcript>: we have this

01:03:33
<transcript>: We have this bright SVG. Now.

01:03:35
shiftlessatol: you should see tiles

01:03:38
<transcript>: It's alongside what.

01:03:44
<transcript>: Now I got to figure out how to use it, right.

01:03:57
<transcript>: Okay, so maybe this where I need the output directory. I think we figured it out. The problems. I want to go back to Pnpm real quick. I just want to rule that out. Want to make sure I can't be using PMPM.

01:03:57
<transcript>: remove

01:03:58
<transcript>: Remove.

01:03:58
<transcript>: node

01:04:00
<transcript>: Node module.

01:04:02
shiftlessatol: it made a file but nothing in it

01:04:05
<transcript>: Also, why is my okay.

01:04:05
<transcript>: remove

01:04:12
<transcript>: Remove yarn lock. Is it yarn lock? Nope. Not with two K's. Definitely not with two case.

01:04:21
<transcript>: So we got rid of yarn lock. We deleted node modules. Whoa. Everything's broken? Oh, because I just.

01:04:24
<transcript>: Pmpm, install.

01:04:28
<transcript>: installs

01:04:28
<transcript>: installs yeah it may

01:04:44
<transcript>: Installs. Yeah, it may a file, but nothing in it. I think there's something in it. I think it's just the way the Sprite. I don't think you can just preview this bright. I think they're like laying on top each other or something dumb and they might be invisible. Unmet peerDependencies next twelve. Oh yeah. We don't need next SDG sprites anymore.

01:04:49
<transcript>: There we go.

01:04:53
<transcript>: Pmpm, remove.

01:04:56
<transcript>: Next SVG sprites.

01:05:04
<transcript>: Pmpm Pnpm install just gotta make sure.

01:05:07
allcliffs: is there a good typeorm for dynamodb ?

01:05:07
<transcript>: And then.

01:05:12
<transcript>: Next config. We've got the dot. Js.

01:05:12
<transcript>: let's see pm

01:05:14
<transcript>: Let's see, PMP, run, Dev. Let's see if it does it.

01:05:14
<transcript>: oh yeah

01:05:18
<transcript>: Oh, yeah? We're still using Pnpm feels good.

01:05:22
<transcript>: Feels good. I'm glad I went back and didn't just assume.

01:05:22
<transcript>: so sprite

01:05:32
<transcript>: So Sprite. Sug is created just now and I think I just got to figure out now with the output directory and all that stuff.

01:05:37
<transcript>: How I want to do also I just gotta fix this as bothering me.

01:05:40
<transcript>: It says that I'm not.

01:05:42
<transcript>: From Next Font, Google.

01:05:48
<transcript>: I'm not. I'm choosing subsets. What are you talking about? It's right there. Oh, it's just for enter. I'm not using it.

01:05:52
<transcript>: I am.

01:05:52
<transcript>: why am i importing

01:05:53
<transcript>: Why am I importing enter here.

01:05:58
<transcript>: This is just a holdover from earlier where I don't see enter.

01:06:08
<transcript>: Now interest not being imported. What are you talking about.

01:06:11
<transcript>: That's weird.

01:06:14
<transcript>: Okay.

01:06:14
<transcript>: ls

01:06:16
<transcript>: Lsp research.

01:06:22
<transcript>: Oh, not that one.

01:06:25
<transcript>: Okay.

01:06:25
<transcript>: so

01:06:36
<transcript>: So this works. Now we need to we're gonna change up the options. We're gonna say Sprite five file name. We can say public path. So publish.

01:06:38
<transcript>: Ad.

01:06:38
<transcript>: we're gonna say

01:06:40
<transcript>: We're gonna say is public.

01:06:44
<transcript>: For that.

01:06:55
<transcript>: Is there a good type or for DynamoDB? Electrodb.

01:06:58
<transcript>: I hear good things about electro.

01:06:58
<transcript>: elect

01:07:00
<transcript>: Electro DB.

01:07:00
<transcript>: yeah

01:07:03
<transcript>: Yeah? From Tyler Walsh.

01:07:07
<transcript>: This is highly recommended from DAX.

01:07:07
<transcript>: and dax

01:07:08
adamdotdev: https://github.com/tywalch/electrodb

01:07:11
<transcript>: And DAX is really good at finding.

01:07:12
<transcript>: Like.

01:07:12
<transcript>: good times

01:07:15
<transcript>: Good timescript, friendly stuff.

01:07:15
<transcript>: the

01:07:20
<transcript>: The README is a little intense, like, look at this scroll bar. Look at this. It's a little intense.

01:07:20
<transcript>: and this

01:07:26
<transcript>: And this is what's put me off so far. It is like I'm too dumb to read all that. But.

01:07:29
<transcript>: Can't say he's not documenting it. Well.

01:07:31
<transcript>: There's a lot there.

01:07:36
<transcript>: Okay. Can I read properties? We'll see. Why did you keep saying that fast? Refresher.

01:07:41
<transcript>: Webpack Hot Dev client whatever.

01:07:41
<transcript>: let

01:07:46
<transcript>: Let's see. Is the file still there? Did it move it to public.

01:07:51
<transcript>: Here. Did it put it in here.

01:07:54
<transcript>: No.

01:07:59
<transcript>: Okay. Where did it put it.

01:08:03
<transcript>: Where did it put it? Let's see.

01:08:03
<transcript>: next

01:08:06
<transcript>: Next. So it's not in there.

01:08:15
<transcript>: Oh, it created a public directory in the next directory. So that's not helpful for me. I don't understand.

01:08:18
<transcript>: Some just say something.

01:08:18
<transcript>: what was that

01:08:22
<transcript>: What was that? Did the audio track just was it like a voice.

01:08:27
<transcript>: That was so weird.

01:08:27
<transcript>: feeling like somebody

01:08:29
<transcript>: Feeling like somebody said a word to me.

01:08:33
<transcript>: That's not where I want it, right.

01:08:33
<transcript>: i

01:08:36
<transcript>: I want it where I can get to it.

01:08:40
<transcript>: Where can I get to it? Or maybe that is where I wanted. I don't even know. Static.

01:08:45
<transcript>: Like, how am I importing all these other things.

01:09:01
<transcript>: How I can output this into a place that I can I can use it because, like these, all these images.

01:09:06
<transcript>: In public. I can. I can download these. I don't need that anymore.

01:09:08
allcliffs: @adamdotdev thanks

01:09:16
<transcript>: Yeah? What we're do? I need it to be put.

01:09:16
<transcript>: so that i can use

01:09:18
<transcript>: So that I can use it.

01:09:18
<transcript>: oh here we go so

01:09:20
<transcript>: Oh, here we go? So server public.

01:09:20
<transcript>: no

01:09:22
<transcript>: No. Is that no.

01:09:29
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:09:40
<transcript>: Sorry. I'll turn on my keycaster. There you go.

01:09:45
<transcript>: Sd spy lower public path. Let's see. So now I need to try and import this thing from.

01:09:49
<transcript>: Index.

01:09:55
<transcript>: My running still Yeah.

01:09:55
<transcript>: let's

01:09:57
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:09:59
<transcript>: Here.

01:09:59
<transcript>: so we have

01:10:02
<transcript>: So we have this sugus.

01:10:05
<transcript>: What.

01:10:08
<transcript>: Happened.

01:10:12
<transcript>: Okay.

01:10:19
<transcript>: So.

01:10:19
<transcript>: what we're trying

01:10:21
<transcript>: What we're trying to do.

01:10:21
<transcript>: is

01:10:23
<transcript>: Is load that SVG.

01:10:30
<transcript>: And then use only the IDs inside of it. So I guess this can this have like an Href or something? No.

01:10:33
<transcript>: How can I do that now.

01:10:35
<transcript>: It's an external SUG file.

01:10:38
<transcript>: I need to import it.

01:10:44
<transcript>: Who knows things about SVG files.

01:10:47
<transcript>: And next, Yes.

01:10:58
<transcript>: I can use an image, but then I can't use I need it to be like this so I can do the used thing.

01:11:02
<transcript>: Okay. Import. I.

01:11:07
<transcript>: Like that.

01:11:13
<transcript>: But that's not going to work through the web pack cycle, like, I need to impose How's this gonna work.

01:11:16
<transcript>: How's this gonna work.

01:11:20
<transcript>: Svgr.

01:11:37
shiftlessatol: you have to change the image reference

01:11:42
<transcript>: I guess this Ahref, can it have the let's see SVG.

01:11:42
<transcript>: sprite

01:11:43
<transcript>: Sprite.

01:11:43
<transcript>: use

01:11:45
<transcript>: Use Ahref.

01:11:48
<transcript>: Absolute path.

01:11:48
<transcript>: something

01:11:49
<transcript>: Something.

01:11:53
allcliffs: @adamdotdev https://react-svgr.com/docs/next/ see here

01:11:53
shiftlessatol: it was always pointing to the same image before which was updated via js

01:11:56
<transcript>: Use Sprite. Sug. Here we go, here we go.

01:11:59
<transcript>: Here we go. Maybe.

01:12:02
<transcript>: This easy.

01:12:06
<transcript>: Probably not.

01:12:10
<transcript>: That easy.

01:12:10
<transcript>: i

01:12:15
<transcript>: I might just have the password though Sprite SVG so it can't find it there. Can it find it in public.

01:12:18
shiftlessatol: now you need to reference the same file with coordinates to the area you're showing

01:12:22
<transcript>: No.

01:12:22
tobs_on_twitch: Hi :). you keyboard sounds so good

01:12:25
<transcript>: So let's try to find.

01:12:29
<transcript>: Public. Sprite. Svg.

01:12:33
<transcript>: Where is that thing? Where is it putting it.

01:12:33
<transcript>: tops on twitch

01:12:39
<transcript>: Tops on Twitch. Welcome to Chat. Thank you. Yeah, I love my keyboard. It's great.

01:12:39
<transcript>: you have

01:12:53
<transcript>: You have to change the image reference. It was always pointing to the same image before which was updated via JS. Now you need to reference the same file with coordinates in the area you're showing. I think we're I think we're saying the same thing, Dave. I think.

01:13:01
<transcript>: You need to figure out how to export this SUG and I'll place that I can reference it.

01:13:05
shiftlessatol: either css

01:13:09
<transcript>: And it's unclear to me.

01:13:09
<transcript>: like

01:13:11
shiftlessatol: or whatever is showing the image

01:13:12
<transcript>: Like I see where.

01:13:19
shiftlessatol: you'll have to modify

01:13:19
<transcript>: I see where it's putting it in here. Public. Right there. See that.

01:13:23
<transcript>: But what I don't understand is.

01:13:26
<transcript>: How I access that.

01:13:28
<transcript>: From the app.

01:13:31
pannosa: Hi ... href should be xlink:href

01:13:35
<transcript>: Like this is the next directory.

01:13:39
<transcript>: How do I put it in static.

01:13:39
<transcript>: is that available

01:13:40
<transcript>: Is that available to me.

01:13:40
<transcript>: like okay

01:13:42
<transcript>: Like okay. So like these chunks.

01:13:46
<transcript>: How does this all work.

01:13:48
<transcript>: Development media.

01:13:54
<transcript>: Okay. So there that font file. We know that's being downloaded. How is that being addressed.

01:14:11
<transcript>: Oh, it's literally underscore next. Static media. Okay. So I can do underscore next. And then just so I'm going to put this into static. I think that makes sense. We'll drop this into static. Okay. Okay. We're gonna try this.

01:14:11
<transcript>: let's just

01:14:13
<transcript>: Let's just go and do this.

01:14:13
<transcript>: static

01:14:14
<transcript>: Static.

01:14:14
<transcript>: and this is

01:14:16
<transcript>: And this is gonna be.

01:14:18
<transcript>: Next. I don't know. Can I do that.

01:14:22
<transcript>: Seems weird, but maybe I can do that.

01:14:22
<transcript>: now we need to go

01:14:24
<transcript>: Now we need to go back.

01:14:24
<transcript>: here and i

01:14:26
<transcript>: Here? And I'm gonna say.

01:14:26
<transcript>: that should

01:14:28
<transcript>: That should be static.

01:14:31
<transcript>: Okay.

01:14:35
<transcript>: It was weird.

01:14:38
taxeroni: "SVG 2 removed the need for the xlink namespace, so instead of xlink:href you should use href." this is per mdn

01:14:51
<transcript>: Pennosaf should be XLink Href. I think they've now they support just Href, right? It doesn't have to be X link anymore. I mean, I can put X link there. I guess it'd be backwards compatible, but yeah, SDG to remove the need for Xlin namespace. So instead of you should. There you go.

01:14:51
<transcript>: welcome to

01:14:53
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat, taxironi.

01:14:58
<transcript>: Oh, wait, what was this.

01:15:05
<transcript>: There's still some, like, fast refresh errors. I don't know if that's because of this webpack stuff I'm doing. Oh, something failed.

01:15:07
pannosa: Ohh, didn't know that. Always used xlink :P

01:15:12
<transcript>: So we have a weird in between it's almost working state should not import the named export filter.

01:15:14
<transcript>: What should not import.

01:15:18
taxeroni: hi slpyVV

01:15:19
<transcript>: So the color everything's wrong? But we're getting there.

01:15:27
<transcript>: None of those errors are related to my issue here.

01:15:27
<transcript>: let's try and get another

01:15:29
<transcript>: Let's try and get another one.

01:15:29
<transcript>: well

01:15:32
<transcript>: Well, I needed a guess right now I got start over.

01:15:32
<transcript>: okay

01:15:35
shiftlessatol: another merch item

01:15:39
<transcript>: Okay. So it's not got the background. It's just doesn't have the background. Is that the issue? Is it stripping it out somewhere.

01:15:45
cowfacedude99: it's a different error LUL

01:15:52
<transcript>: Okay, let me just try and get one right earlier. I got like twelve in a row. Right now. I can figure out one of them. Yeah. So it's missing a background. That's interesting.

01:15:58
shiftlessatol: " everything is wrong - but we're getting there"

01:15:59
<transcript>: Oh, did I just see that it still didn't load a file correctly? What's that? Is that an old.

01:16:03
<transcript>: Let's do a refresh.

01:16:07
<transcript>: Everything is wrong. But we're getting there. That's right.

01:16:07
<transcript>: so

01:16:11
<transcript>: So what's this? What's? Trying to grab.

01:16:15
<transcript>: There's a 404 here on this SUG. What is this.

01:16:20
<transcript>: Public Sprite? Where are we still trying to get public.

01:16:30
<transcript>: I don't see where I'm trying to load public Sprite.

01:16:30
<transcript>: like

01:16:32
<transcript>: Like, what are you talking about.

01:16:36
<transcript>: I'm not. I'm definitely not.

01:16:44
<transcript>: I feel like there's something screwy going on today. Something kind of screwy with my browser. Maybe. Or with I don't know.

01:16:47
<transcript>: Let's disable that.

01:16:50
<transcript>: I don't know.

01:16:55
<transcript>: Predictable action arguments are true when using Create machine.

01:16:59
<transcript>: Yes, something's. Something's weird.

01:17:01
<transcript>: I don't like it.

01:17:03
<transcript>: Not one bit.

01:17:04
allcliffs: but is the file there ?

01:17:11
<transcript>: Like we had a situation earlier, where it was. We were getting errors in the console for code that had been deleted long ago.

01:17:15
<transcript>: And I don't understand what is going on.

01:17:15
<transcript>: what's hanging

01:17:18
<transcript>: What's hanging on to what? Like where.

01:17:18
<transcript>: are you seeing

01:17:24
<transcript>: Are you seeing someone trying to fetch public Sprite SDG it's just not a thing.

01:17:27
<transcript>: Not in the codebase.

01:17:35
<transcript>: Like this is from static Sprite. Okay, the file is saved.

01:17:35
<transcript>: what is

01:17:36
<transcript>: What is the deal.

01:17:36
<transcript>: hanging on

01:17:40
<transcript>: Hanging on to something? Let's just blow away, okay? Here's what we're gonna do.

01:17:46
<transcript>: Here's what we're gonna do, Peter. People. We're gonna we're gonna get heavyhanded here. Remove.

01:17:48
<transcript>: Node, modules.

01:17:48
<transcript>: now

01:17:50
<transcript>: Now we'll just start with next.

01:17:53
<transcript>: Okay.

01:17:58
<transcript>: Let's do a pnpm.

01:18:03
<transcript>: Run build and Kim him run start I'm just now I'm gonna run the dead server.

01:18:05
<transcript>: Is the file there.

01:18:08
<transcript>: It's like showing the browser is showing.

01:18:08
<transcript>: that i'm

01:18:10
<transcript>: That I'm.

01:18:10
<transcript>: requesting

01:18:15
<transcript>: Requesting a file I'm not requesting. So there's something like stored in the browser.

01:18:15
<transcript>: some file

01:18:18
<transcript>: Some file that is not getting updated.

01:18:18
<transcript>: oh that's

01:18:26
<transcript>: Oh, that's what the Saturation refresh errors are. I bet. Like something about my Webpack. Hmr is not working or something. And it's got old modules.

01:18:26
<transcript>: it's still doing it

01:18:27
<transcript>: It's still doing it.

01:18:29
<transcript>: Like, what is this.

01:18:32
<transcript>: Okay. Here's what we're gonna do.

01:18:36
<transcript>: Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna.

01:18:40
<transcript>: Close in them.

01:18:43
<transcript>: We're gonna reopen in them.

01:18:44
th3_l3m0n: maybe clear the browser cache?

01:18:49
<transcript>: We're going to.

01:18:51
<transcript>: Remove.

01:18:51
<transcript>: node

01:18:52
<transcript>: Node, modules.

01:18:54
<transcript>: We're gonna remove.

01:18:57
<transcript>: Next.

01:18:58
cowfacedude99: worst case, change the port and try

01:19:01
<transcript>: And.

01:19:01
<transcript>: what else

01:19:04
<transcript>: What else? What else? I want to delete.

01:19:11
<transcript>: No. Okay, that's good. Now we're gonna do PMPM install.

01:19:13
shiftlessatol: A.D:: " here's what we're gonna do..."

01:19:19
<transcript>: Again. Oh, that's a good idea.

01:19:27
<transcript>: That's a good idea.

01:19:35
<transcript>: Here's what we're gonna do.

01:19:46
<transcript>: Dave, is David's on top of my little Idioms? My little sayings today PMPM install now PMPM run down Dev. We are just gonna run the Dev server.

01:19:46
<transcript>: i'm fine

01:19:47
<transcript>: I'm fine with that.

01:19:51
<transcript>: What is generate do? Oh, yeah, it creates.

01:19:58
<transcript>: Okay. We're running the data server people. I'm closing this to. I'm closing Chrome. I'm just restarting Chrome.

01:20:01
<transcript>: Watch this.

01:20:01
<transcript>: get out of here

01:20:03
shiftlessatol: coming to a drink mug near you

01:20:05
<transcript>: Get out of here. Chrome should have had some a Rick roll me but that would have cost to make 5000 points.

01:20:10
<transcript>: Email.

01:20:10
<transcript>: everything

01:20:13
<transcript>: Everything. No. Get out of here.

01:20:15
<transcript>: Okay.

01:20:15
<transcript>: local

01:20:17
<transcript>: Localhost 3000.

01:20:22
<transcript>: A brand new start? People brand new start.

01:20:25
<transcript>: How are we looking.

01:20:27
<transcript>: New game.

01:20:35
<transcript>: Aha, it didn't. It didn't try and fetch the wrong Sprite. So that's a that's a positive. It also still doesn't work. That's a negative.

01:20:39
<transcript>: What is this? Code Whisperer.

01:20:42
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:20:49
<transcript>: Okay, so backgrounds just backgrounds are missing. That's solvable SVG Sprite loader.

01:20:53
<transcript>: Like a solvable. Think we can get there.

01:20:56
allcliffs: but its there

01:21:00
<transcript>: I think so.

01:21:04
allcliffs: background might now be attached to id ?

01:21:08
<transcript>: Is it minimizing or what's it doing? The individual sprites. Let's see.

01:21:10
shiftlessatol: so the logos are right, the colors are not?

01:21:11
<transcript>: Never gonna.

01:21:11
<transcript>: change

01:21:12
<transcript>: Change.

01:21:23
<transcript>: Is this like there's two different modes. Extract and then the other mode. Is that what's going? Let's see.

01:21:35
<transcript>: External threat files generated for images imported from.

01:21:35
<transcript>: those places

01:21:37
<transcript>: Those places.

01:21:38
cowfacedude99: You should use a different streaming profile on chrome. That way, we don't see your email.

01:21:42
<transcript>: Svg stacking technique. This sounds suss.

01:21:47
<transcript>: You should use a different streaming profile. Chrome. That way you don't see your email. Yeah, I should do that.

01:21:47
<transcript>: so

01:21:50
<transcript>: So the logos are right. The colors are not.

01:21:50
<transcript>: back

01:21:59
<transcript>: Background might now be attached to ID. I guess let's let's just like, inspect the Sprite. How about that.

01:21:59
<transcript>: how about that

01:22:00
<transcript>: How about that.

01:22:00
<transcript>: are we smart enough

01:22:03
<transcript>: Are we smart enough to look at the Sprite and make sense of it.

01:22:07
<transcript>: Here's, let's open it with.

01:22:10
<transcript>: Text, mate? I don't know.

01:22:10
<transcript>: who it is

01:22:12
<transcript>: Who it is people.

01:22:15
<transcript>: This is the Sprite.

01:22:21
<transcript>: Okay symbol.

01:22:21
<transcript>: so like here

01:22:24
<transcript>: So like here is one of the one of the things.

01:22:24
<transcript>: phil

01:22:26
<transcript>: Phil. None.

01:22:26
<transcript>: phil none

01:22:28
<transcript>: Phil. None.

01:22:28
<transcript>: oh

01:22:30
<transcript>: Oh, wait, pathfill.

01:22:33
shiftlessatol: yep

01:22:40
<transcript>: I feel like that's the problem right there. Did it strip out the fill. I think that's a thing some people want, and I don't want.

01:22:40
<transcript>: phil

01:22:41
<transcript>: Phil.

01:22:45
cowfacedude99: all I see is a wall of text LUL

01:22:47
<transcript>: It's weird that it didn't do it.

01:22:50
<transcript>: All I see is a wall text. Yeah.

01:22:55
<transcript>: You know, I it's weird that when we didn't do the extract way.

01:22:55
<transcript>: what's

01:22:57
<transcript>: What's the stacking technique.

01:23:20
<transcript>: Background.

01:23:20
<transcript>: sprite

01:23:24
<transcript>: Sprite Sugue do I need to do that.

01:23:28
<transcript>: Now I should just feel do the ID, right.

01:23:40
<transcript>: I just want to stack the icons on top each other.

01:23:45
<transcript>: Oh.

01:23:56
<transcript>: Is this where ours did? I don't know. I'm trying to learn things really fast, but I don't know if I am. I feel like Phil.

01:24:03
shiftlessatol: that would be layers

01:24:06
<transcript>: Let's search fill on here.

01:24:13
<transcript>: Issues Ah.

01:24:14
allcliffs: can you search for id in the svg file, then you will see if it has a seperate bg

01:24:17
<transcript>: Svg fill loader.

01:24:21
<transcript>: Oh, I have to say the Filt. No.

01:24:30
<transcript>: What's this.

01:24:36
<transcript>: Search for ID and the SUG file. Then you'll see if it is a separate BG.

01:24:41
<transcript>: Like search for a specific ID.

01:24:41
<transcript>: i mean here's

01:24:43
<transcript>: I mean here's one of them.

01:24:43
<transcript>: so this

01:24:45
<transcript>: So this symbol right here.

01:24:48
<transcript>: Can I do like symbol.

01:24:54
<transcript>: I highlight them all. I don't know. I should open this in neovim. Shouldn't I.

01:25:00
<transcript>: Yeah, let's open it. Neil. Them. I wear. Is it next? Static Sprite. Svg.

01:25:00
<transcript>: okay

01:25:02
<transcript>: Okay.

01:25:06
<transcript>: Next.

01:25:09
<transcript>: Static Sprite.

01:25:09
<transcript>: svd

01:25:11
<transcript>: Svd.

01:25:11
<transcript>: but here it is

01:25:12
<transcript>: But here it is.

01:25:12
<transcript>: and all of its

01:25:13
<transcript>: And all of its glory.

01:25:13
<transcript>: the

01:25:15
<transcript>: The formatting.

01:25:18
<transcript>: Is.

01:25:18
<transcript>: not so good

01:25:20
<transcript>: Not so good, it's one big line.

01:25:25
<transcript>: But I feel like that fill nun is the issue, right.

01:25:30
<transcript>: Simple usage.

01:25:30
<transcript>: target

01:25:32
<transcript>: Target Slate in line.

01:25:38
<transcript>: It's like it. I think it's stripped out the cell. I think we're gonna find an answer here. Hang on.

01:25:43
<transcript>: Using the Spriteloader inline styles like that are changed by the loader.

01:25:50
allcliffs: no it might be a line or a border

01:25:52
<transcript>: I don't understand any of that.

01:25:59
<transcript>: All Pascu replaced with search iRendering.

01:26:02
<transcript>: No color AHA.

01:26:02
<transcript>: how

01:26:03
<transcript>: How.

01:26:08
<transcript>: Things are the Follow Arthur.

01:26:15
<transcript>: No, it might be a line or a border. That's true. All cliffs. I might not be looking through. Right thing. Well, sometimes pass.

01:26:15
<transcript>: what

01:26:19
<transcript>: What if I try to import in a view component like so.

01:26:19
<transcript>: the

01:26:21
<transcript>: The watch enters an endless loop.

01:26:37
<transcript>: Where do you say anything about color.

01:26:40
<transcript>: Just in the title.

01:26:47
<transcript>: This is the generated SVG.

01:26:50
<transcript>: That doesn't help me.

01:27:00
<transcript>: Fill Loader's deprecated.

01:27:13
<transcript>: Does it just say it in the docs? Did I just miss where this is a thing.

01:27:18
<transcript>: Color.

01:27:20
<transcript>: Background.

01:27:20
<transcript>: nothing

01:27:21
<transcript>: Nothing.

01:27:21
<transcript>: oh

01:27:23
<transcript>: Oh 20.

01:27:30
<transcript>: Am I using 20.

01:27:44
<transcript>: Extract configuration.

01:27:44
<transcript>: plane sp

01:27:47
<transcript>: Plane Sprite. I should look at all these. I guess.

01:27:51
<transcript>: You can render plain, Sprite and extraordinary without styles and usages.

01:27:55
<transcript>: I don't want a plane Sprite, right? I want.

01:28:01
<transcript>: Is that the default? Maybe. No. Probably not.

01:28:06
<transcript>: Without style usages like disease have styles in the.

01:28:09
<transcript>: Style.

01:28:16
<transcript>: So what am I seeing here.

01:28:23
<transcript>: I'll fill URL.

01:28:30
<transcript>: I don't know. What do we think.

01:28:33
allcliffs: so you need plainsprite:false

01:28:33
<transcript>: All cliffs. Do you have ideas.

01:28:39
<transcript>: You need plainfrite false. We can try that. Yeah, let's try it.

01:28:39
<transcript>: it's just worth a shot

01:28:40
<transcript>: It's just worth a shot.

01:28:45
<transcript>: Low risk high potential reward.

01:28:45
<transcript>: so

01:28:48
<transcript>: So let's say down here.

01:28:51
<transcript>: We're gonna say plane.

01:28:51
<transcript>: plane

01:28:54
<transcript>: Plane Sprot.

01:29:00
<transcript>: I don't think I have a plane Sprite right now, but let's just try this.

01:29:00
<transcript>: it's

01:29:02
<transcript>: It's worth a shot.

01:29:10
<transcript>: Maybe look at examples again.

01:29:16
<transcript>: I maybe just missing something with the way I'm addressing it. Browser Sprite extract.

01:29:19
<transcript>: Mode.

01:29:22
<transcript>: So, Twitter.

01:29:24
<transcript>: But I did the external.

01:29:29
<transcript>: What.

01:29:29
<transcript>: in browse

01:29:36
<transcript>: In browser Sprite is rendered and injected in page automatically. What? Okay, let's try this again.

01:29:46
<transcript>: So is it downloading the Sprite? Yeah. Downloads it right there.

01:29:48
<transcript>: Still looks the same.

01:29:52
<transcript>: Okay. Let's go back here.

01:29:52
barryxbtw: ight im back, turned to me going to the mall too lol, ice cream wednesday

01:30:06
<transcript>: In browser. Sprite is rendered in browser. Sprite is rendered. There need to be like a comma there or something. Spray is ready and injected in page automatically. You just refer to images via that. I don't think that's true.

01:30:06
<transcript>: oh

01:30:07
<transcript>: Oh.

01:30:09
<transcript>: Wait.

01:30:14
<transcript>: Because they imported it like that, right.

01:30:30
<transcript>: Now.

01:30:33
<transcript>: Okay. Let's go back here.

01:30:33
<transcript>: x with

01:30:36
<transcript>: X with DLL extract mode. What's that.

01:30:39
<transcript>: No. Read me on this one.

01:30:41
<transcript>: What's? Dll.

01:30:45
<transcript>: Svg.

01:30:48
<transcript>: Used symbol data. Url.

01:30:52
<transcript>: I'm so confused.

01:30:55
<transcript>: So confused.

01:31:01
<transcript>: What is dealing.

01:31:07
<transcript>: Script file name.

01:31:09
<transcript>: Deal.

01:31:20
<transcript>: All right, Berries, back. Turn to me. Going to the mall to ice cream Wednesday. Turning, you going.

01:31:20
<transcript>: okay

01:31:25
<transcript>: Okay, so the planes bright, false was a red herring. I didn't do it.

01:31:29
<transcript>: What's different about extracting mode.

01:31:29
<transcript>: automatically

01:31:32
<transcript>: Automatically for images imported from there.

01:31:35
<transcript>: Like why.

01:31:39
<transcript>: I don't understand.

01:31:39
<transcript>: why

01:31:42
<transcript>: Why the extract mode.

01:31:42
<transcript>: broke

01:31:44
<transcript>: Broke color.

01:31:53
<transcript>: As you spread separate files except true when loaders extra.

01:31:53
<transcript>: returning value

01:31:57
<transcript>: Returning value is extracted. Sprite file URL with symbol ID at the end.

01:32:07
<transcript>: Demo I guess we'll see if this still is the thing.

01:32:13
<transcript>: Image source Sprite. Sug Twitter usage.

01:32:21
<transcript>: Oh, so can I just use.

01:32:30
<transcript>: Can I just use Sprite SVG and just leave the public passing out and it'll figure it out. Maybe.

01:32:32
<transcript>: Maybe.

01:32:37
<transcript>: Spry. Let's see.

01:32:39
shiftlessatol: 'svg-fill-loader', 'svgo-loader'

01:32:44
<transcript>: Or I'd have to use HTML extract or whatever this is.

01:32:44
<transcript>: i don't know

01:32:45
<transcript>: I don't know.

01:32:52
<transcript>: Svg fill loader SV goloader.

01:32:56
<transcript>: Those are words, Dave. One of those mean.

01:33:02
<transcript>: What do those words mean.

01:33:07
barryxbtw: this whole sprite thing seems fun

01:33:11
shiftlessatol: https://gist.github.com/Temp2017/7075932163f3bbd0e6b50d59a307e313

01:33:13
<transcript>: Let's look at.

01:33:16
shiftlessatol: last code snippet

01:33:19
<transcript>: I'm gonna look, I'm gonna compare let's compare here we go.

01:33:25
<transcript>: So here we've got I wish I could put some, like, line breaks quickly in this.

01:33:32
<transcript>: Okay.

01:33:32
<transcript>: let's just do this

01:33:33
<transcript>: Let's just do this.

01:33:44
<transcript>: One.

01:33:54
<transcript>: Just trying to make sense of this.

01:33:59
<transcript>: Oh.

01:34:07
<transcript>: Okay.

01:34:09
<transcript>: Fill none.

01:34:17
<transcript>: I want to compare this with the actual SUG. So we're gonna find watch this.

01:34:20
<transcript>: We're gonna find the SCG.

01:34:27
<transcript>: In here public.

01:34:27
<transcript>: images

01:34:28
<transcript>: Images.

01:34:32
<transcript>: Hashed. So, what is this? 1002 a.

01:34:35
<transcript>: Here.

01:34:35
<transcript>: we're gonna open

01:34:37
<transcript>: We're gonna open this.

01:34:44
<transcript>: Somewhere where I can look at the I'm just comparing these two. Right.

01:34:44
<transcript>: so view

01:34:46
<transcript>: So Viewbox.

01:34:49
<transcript>: Viewbox.

01:34:53
allcliffs: you can see that the fill is referencing another id, so maybe that doesnt get imported

01:34:53
<transcript>: So here they've got some stop offset.

01:34:53
<transcript>: and stop

01:34:58
<transcript>: And stop color. This is like a gradient fill, right? Yeah. Linear gradient. Okay.

01:34:58
<transcript>: that's

01:35:00
<transcript>: That's the background right.

01:35:04
<transcript>: When your gradient right there.

01:35:06
<transcript>: Okay.

01:35:15
<transcript>: Well, why can't I.

01:35:20
<transcript>: Look the same.

01:35:23
<transcript>: Stop. I said Stop. Colors.

01:35:27
<transcript>: Looks the same. Yeah. Okay.

01:35:34
<transcript>: G filmen fill rule even. Okay, so that was not bad. That that says film on it's. Something else.

01:35:34
<transcript>: path

01:35:36
<transcript>: Path, fill.

01:35:40
<transcript>: Where do we use this linear gradient.

01:35:50
<transcript>: Where are we using it.

01:35:54
<transcript>: Silk.

01:35:58
<transcript>: Rule. Fill URL a okay.

01:36:01
<transcript>: So it's that pass right there.

01:36:05
<transcript>: That has the URL fill. Yes, this one.

01:36:09
<transcript>: So it should be should be grabbing a.

01:36:09
<transcript>: this thing

01:36:15
<transcript>: This thing? Is that ID right there? So why is it why isn't. Yeah. Why isn't it working.

01:36:15
<transcript>: why is that

01:36:21
<transcript>: Why is that not working? Url. Does it need these need to all have the file name in them? No.

01:36:27
<transcript>: I don't understand why it's not working.

01:36:27
<transcript>: it looks

01:36:29
<transcript>: It looks similar.

01:36:33
<transcript>: It's not stripping anything out. That's for sure. Right.

01:36:34
allcliffs: maybe url doesnt work when its extracted

01:36:39
allcliffs: because it extracts the id

01:36:40
<transcript>: You can see that the fill is referencing another ID. So maybe that doesn't get imported.

01:36:40
<transcript>: maybe

01:36:44
<transcript>: Maybe URL doesn't work when it's extracted because it extracts the idea.

01:36:51
<transcript>: Yeah. What would be the alternative.

01:36:51
<transcript>: like

01:36:52
<transcript>: Like.

01:36:54
<transcript>: If this.

01:36:54
<transcript>: weren't

01:37:00
<transcript>: Weren't URL. What would it be? Just the cell would be like the ID itself. Svg.

01:37:00
<transcript>: sc

01:37:03
<transcript>: Scg fill URL.

01:37:09
<transcript>: Behaving strangely.

01:37:09
<transcript>: in firefox

01:37:11
<transcript>: In Firefox.

01:37:15
<transcript>: Like it's within this file.

01:37:15
<transcript>: so

01:37:19
<transcript>: So that should work right. Url gradient two.

01:37:26
<transcript>: Let's.

01:37:36
<transcript>: Open this thing in something else, not the browser. Sprite. Svg open with.

01:37:36
<transcript>: what

01:37:38
<transcript>: What would be able to visualize that.

01:37:38
<transcript>: i guess

01:37:42
<transcript>: I guess I try Firefox. Oh, illustrator.

01:37:46
<transcript>: Let's see what it looks like. An illustrator.

01:37:57
<transcript>: What did you say, Dave? Last code? Snip. This whole Sprite thing seems fun. Yeah, so much fun.

01:38:01
<transcript>: I'm having so much fun can you tell how much fun I'm having.

01:38:05
<transcript>: Okay. Here's our spray.

01:38:11
<transcript>: There's your problem. There's nothing in it.

01:38:12
vagorge: looks good

01:38:12
<transcript>: I don't know.

01:38:12
<transcript>: sprites

01:38:14
<transcript>: Sprites.

01:38:22
<transcript>: I feel like it's evident in this Sprite that there's no background colors, you know, like there might be other stuff.

01:38:26
shiftlessatol: change the bg

01:38:27
<transcript>: I don't know if there's anything in the I don't know.

01:38:29
shiftlessatol: add a new layer

01:38:29
allcliffs: layers

01:38:32
<transcript>: How can I, like explore layers. Oh, look at this.

01:38:36
shiftlessatol: that is not white

01:38:41
allcliffs: look at layers level

01:38:43
<transcript>: Oh, look. So they're all just invisible. And I can make them visible.

01:38:48
<transcript>: This is presumably what our things should be doing, right.

01:38:59
shiftlessatol: it is

01:38:59
<transcript>: Yeah. Layers. So we're doing.

01:39:02
shiftlessatol: but not the gradients

01:39:03
<transcript>: We're learning things. Maybe. Thanks for following Moose.

01:39:08
<transcript>: We're learning things.

01:39:08
<transcript>: maybe

01:39:09
<transcript>: Maybe.

01:39:09
<transcript>: maybe

01:39:15
<transcript>: Maybe learning things. The backgrounds look fine in here. Right? So.

01:39:19
<transcript>: What is the issue.

01:39:19
<transcript>: issue

01:39:21
<transcript>: Issue Clip Group What's this.

01:39:24
<transcript>: No, not.

01:39:30
<transcript>: I'm looking for.

01:39:33
<transcript>: Layer One. Okay.

01:39:41
<transcript>: So maybe this isn't as bad as we think. Maybe this isn't maybe it's just a little thing that needs to change, not a big thing.

01:39:43
<transcript>: Maybe.

01:39:43
<transcript>: let's

01:39:48
<transcript>: Let's go back to our where we're importing it and we'll see if there's maybe something I can do.

01:39:48
<transcript>: not

01:39:49
<transcript>: Not out there.

01:39:52
<transcript>: Index.

01:39:57

01:40:53
<transcript>: Oh, plane Sprite. I changed. Let's just delete all that.

<transcript>: It also just doesn't need to run right now.

01:44:54
<transcript>: Okay.

01:45:05
<transcript>: This basic stuff today just basic stuff can't get basic stuff working.

<transcript>: Restart. We're calling restart. Right here.

01:47:34
allcliffs: LUL

<transcript>: To.

01:48:24
<transcript>: What it still went to game over.

01:48:31
<transcript>: That timer stuff is superficial. It's just for the visual of the timer.

01:48:33
<transcript>: Okay.

01:48:38
<transcript>: Oh, man? What those days.

01:48:38
<transcript>: it's

<transcript>: Really long timer.

01:48:55
<transcript>: Yeah. Plus 30. Let's make that.

01:48:59
<transcript>: Nope. Not that.

01:49:05

01:49:34
vagorge: lol

01:49:46
<transcript>: 32 me seconds.

01:49:56
shiftlessatol: "it's broken and we're not getting there anymore "

01:50:04
<transcript>: You were all in SVG.

01:50:18
<transcript>: What.

01:50:22
<transcript>: Why did that affect the SVG load.

01:50:25
<transcript>: Going on today.

01:50:25
<transcript>: someone

01:50:27
<transcript>: Someone tell me what's going on.

01:50:30
<transcript>: Just like you shouldn't have streamed today.

01:50:32
<transcript>: Oh, this is.

01:50:34
<transcript>: Mis punishment.

01:50:34
<transcript>: streaming

01:50:35
<transcript>: Streaming.

01:50:39
<transcript>: Like what's the problem here? Why doesn't it even load now.

01:50:40
barryxbtw: is all going down

01:50:47
<transcript>: It's all going down.

01:50:47
<transcript>: it's all

01:50:49
<transcript>: It's all going down.

01:50:49
<transcript>: thanks so much for

01:50:51
<transcript>: Thanks so much for following recycle.

01:50:54
<transcript>: I'm not gonna read your whole name because that's gross.

01:51:03
<transcript>: Like what? What happened.

01:51:06
<transcript>: And now it can't load the Sprite.

01:51:06
<transcript>: if it

01:51:12
<transcript>: If it's trying to find it from public, I'm gonna lose my mind no. Okay.

01:51:15
<transcript>: But it can't find it nonetheless and that's annoying.

01:51:23
<transcript>: Static it's the day.

01:51:23
<transcript>: why

01:51:26
<transcript>: Why didn't it create it? What in the world.

01:51:26
<transcript>: is

01:51:27
allcliffs: @adamdotdev 1) the linear reference by id url can be affected by base path etc. 2) the linear bg might be set to display none by default so even if it loads correctly thats the reason it might be hidden.

01:51:29
<transcript>: Is going on.

01:51:32
recyclepoopandeatit: y not read the name please  , dude do you discuss open source here

01:51:41
<transcript>: It's not even creating the Sprite. Now.

01:51:57
<transcript>: Okay, all clips. Here we go. The linear reference by Idurl can be affected by base path, etc. The linear background might be such a display none by default. So even if it loads correctly, that's a reason it might be hidden. Interesting.

01:52:05
<transcript>: Why not read the name, please recycled poop and eat it. That's just kind of gross. I don't know.

01:52:10
<transcript>: Do you discuss Open Source here.

01:52:10
<transcript>: so yeah

01:52:14
janluofficial: I wrote 762 lines of css and still dont know anything

01:52:17
<transcript>: So yeah. I mean, we do a lot of poking around an open source repos and trying to use them and then complaining when they're broken.

01:52:17
<transcript>: things

01:52:25
<transcript>: Things like that. I wrote 762 lines of CSS and still don't know anything. Yeah. That happened with CSS.

01:52:33
<transcript>: Are we getting an error? Is it failing to write? Is it not writing the Sprite? What happened.

01:52:35
<transcript>: For the phone Zol.

01:52:42
<transcript>: This was work. This was working. This was not our problem. Now we've a new problem.

01:52:42
<transcript>: this just

01:52:47
<transcript>: This just whack them all today public past. Static. We're like what happened here.

01:52:47
<transcript>: what

01:52:48
<transcript>: What happened.

01:53:03
<transcript>: We're doing it again. Like it's even me messing up my shell. Do you see that? Did you see that? Okay. We're killing.

01:53:09
<transcript>: Next no.

01:53:22
<transcript>: Did we have the file? We had the buffer open, didn't we? We had the buffer open so it couldn't write to the Sprite. Maybe that would explain that. Maybe I need some explanations. You know, I just need some explanation.

01:53:22
<transcript>: remove

01:53:24
<transcript>: Remove, next.

01:53:26
<transcript>: Remove.

01:53:28
shiftlessatol: the file is open in illustrator

01:53:29
<transcript>: Node, modules.

01:54:18
<transcript>: On stream on Wednesdays. I should have not streamed on a Wednesday.

01:54:21

01:55:27
<transcript>: Shouldn't I.

01:55:28
shiftlessatol: look @ the props

01:55:33
<transcript>: We've looked at this file.

01:55:36
<transcript>: With what we know about the file.

01:55:38
<transcript>: Look at the props.

01:55:40
shiftlessatol: in styels

01:55:41
<transcript>: What props? These.

01:55:42
allcliffs: open in new tab ?

01:55:45
shiftlessatol: and modify

01:55:49
shiftlessatol: yes

01:55:53
<transcript>: Are what props am I looking at.

01:56:00
<transcript>: Opening a new tab. Open this one. A new tab.

01:56:04
daglee: How many % of your nutrients comes from larbars?

01:56:06
<transcript>: So it's presumably all white right now and we can't see it.

01:56:06
shiftlessatol: the one that highlights the image

01:56:08
<transcript>: Right.

01:56:11
<transcript>: How many.

01:56:11
<transcript>: percent of your

01:56:14
<transcript>: Percent of your nutrients come from Larvars. I'd say about 25%.

01:56:16
allcliffs: there was background color greyed out

01:56:16
shiftlessatol: and start changing background-ish things

01:56:18
<transcript>: The one that highlights the image.

01:56:23
<transcript>: Inspect this one. Maybe.

01:56:25
<transcript>: Okay.

01:56:29
<transcript>: Oh Oh.

01:56:38
<transcript>: These. No, these are like no, never mind. Those are my issues.

01:56:38
<transcript>: okay

01:56:40
<transcript>: Okay. So here is the SVG.

01:56:40
<transcript>: this is much

01:56:46
<transcript>: This is much easier to look at. We're gonna get someone with this. Thanks for the ball. Treflix is.

01:56:50
<transcript>: There was a background color. Grayed out. Really.

01:56:50
<transcript>: where

01:56:51
<transcript>: Where.

01:56:57
<transcript>: So here's our cells.

01:57:02
<transcript>: Use ID do I need to be putting usage on the end.

01:57:07
<transcript>: Am I supposed to do that.

01:57:20
<transcript>: I'm doing what I'm going in here.

01:57:25
<transcript>: Fill none.

01:57:29
<transcript>: So there's the path to that URL.

01:57:35
<transcript>: Do I need to just do underscore usage.

01:57:37
<transcript>: No.

01:57:43
<transcript>: Cds uses they have the usage.

01:57:43
<transcript>: sprit

01:57:45
<transcript>: Sprite. Symbol usage.

01:57:48
<transcript>: Like one of those.

01:57:52
<transcript>: They're just using the ID, though.

01:57:56
<transcript>: I'm confused.

01:58:08
<transcript>: But here's our symbols. These are the things. Oh, linear gradient is outside of the symbol.

01:58:08
<transcript>: it's got

01:58:12
<transcript>: It's got symbols in the gradient. Symbol, gradient. Okay.

01:58:12
<transcript>: and

01:58:16
<transcript>: And the gradient. That's the idea. Right there. Right.

01:58:20
<transcript>: Inside this symbol. It should be saying.

01:58:22
<transcript>: This path. Right here.

01:58:27
<transcript>: Is supposed to use that background, right.

01:58:33
<transcript>: Where's the problem.

01:58:36
<transcript>: Like this is the linear gradient.

01:58:43
<transcript>: And it's doing URL.

01:58:43
<transcript>: and

01:58:44
<transcript>: And then the ID.

01:58:49
<transcript>: Is this thing also hidden or something.

01:58:51
<transcript>: Like.

01:58:59
<transcript>: No, it doesn't have any kind of style applied to it. Right.

01:59:04
<transcript>: Who's making sense of this? Anybody.

01:59:07
<transcript>: You've been making sense of this.

01:59:17
<transcript>: So there's that G.

01:59:17
<transcript>: i think just

01:59:22
shiftlessatol: go back to game

01:59:22
<transcript>: I think just understanding how these are laid out with helping. So they're all in the same spot.

01:59:24
shiftlessatol: inspect

01:59:26
<transcript>: Go back to the game.

01:59:29
shiftlessatol: find image object

01:59:30
<transcript>: I'm inspecting it's right here.

01:59:36
shiftlessatol: change stytle

01:59:36
<transcript>: That's all it is that's the whole SVG right there.

01:59:36
<transcript>: we're just

01:59:38
<transcript>: We're just using.

01:59:39
shiftlessatol: see what is not happening

01:59:40
<transcript>: Ahref, and then the ID.

01:59:40
<transcript>: let's add

01:59:42
<transcript>: Let's add usage.

01:59:42
<transcript>: change

01:59:45
<transcript>: Change style. See what is not happening.

01:59:46
<transcript>: What do you mean.

01:59:46
<transcript>: change the style

01:59:50
<transcript>: Change the style of this. What would I change it to.

01:59:53
shiftlessatol: change style

01:59:55
<transcript>: Let's do this. Let's go.

02:00:04
<transcript>: Here. Let's say instead of just use.

02:00:04
shiftlessatol: next section down

02:00:10
allcliffs: add display:block

02:00:13
<transcript>: Here. Let's say usage. I don't know. I'm just grasping the straws. Here.

02:00:19
<transcript>: Grasspin at straws.

02:00:22
<transcript>: Does not work. It doesn't break it.

02:00:22
<transcript>: did it actually

02:00:24
<transcript>: Did it actually.

02:00:24
<transcript>: there's actually change

02:00:27
<transcript>: There's actually change? Or did My HMR network.

02:00:30
<transcript>: Now it just changed usage.

02:00:32
<transcript>: Thanks for follow.

02:00:32
<transcript>: it's

02:00:39
<transcript>: It's me. Your salt. It's mirror salt. Add display block to what.

02:00:39
<transcript>: what

02:00:41
<transcript>: What would I display block to.

02:00:41
<transcript>: and

02:00:43
<transcript>: And here you mean.

02:00:43
<transcript>: it's a linear gradient

02:00:47
<transcript>: It's a linear gradient to one of the linear gradients display block.

02:00:55
shiftlessatol: no

02:00:55
<transcript>: These don't have any styles applied. That was the would make them not visible. They're just gradients. Or that's not what you're talking about.

02:01:02
<transcript>: Now changed I'll name section down next section down.

02:01:04
shiftlessatol: you're doing it wrong

02:01:04
<transcript>: What do you mean.

02:01:04
<transcript>: here

02:01:06
<transcript>: Here.

02:01:10
<transcript>: I'm doing it wrong. What if I do it wrong.

02:01:13
<transcript>: What are you talking about.

02:01:15
<transcript>: This is the whole SVG element.

02:01:16
shiftlessatol: window

02:01:21
<transcript>: I don't need to do display block on it. Is that what you're saying? It's already displayed.

02:01:21
shiftlessatol: where it says Styles

02:01:25
<transcript>: Window, where it says styles.

02:01:25
<transcript>: yeah

02:01:28
shiftlessatol: below the element

02:01:35
<transcript>: Yeah. This window display block. This is not gonna help me. I feel like I misunderstanding you because it doesn't make any sense. This is already displayed below the element.

02:01:39
shiftlessatol: no

02:01:41
<transcript>: Yeah. No, I know what you're talking about. I just don't think it makes sense.

02:01:44
<transcript>: I understand the words you were saying.

02:01:44
<transcript>: no

02:01:47
<transcript>: No. Below the element no.

02:01:53
shiftlessatol: keep scrolling through styles until you highlight the image

02:02:00
shiftlessatol: that will be the style of the element

02:02:01
<transcript>: And display block. Could you guys tell me what I'm adding display block to? I know how to add display block. I'm totally aware of how to do that. Keep scrolling through styles until you highlight the image. This is the image.

02:02:05
recyclepoopandeatit: I can help , wats the prblem statement

02:02:05
<transcript>: This right here is the image. It's this SVG.

02:02:05
<transcript>: are we clear on that

02:02:05
shiftlessatol: then modify the style

02:02:07
<transcript>: Are we clear on that.

02:02:09
<transcript>: What's the problem statement.

02:02:14
daglee: html/css has it ever made sense?

02:02:15
shiftlessatol: in the styels

02:02:17
<transcript>: Then modify the style. What would I it's already got display block literally right there. What would I change.

02:02:28
<transcript>: Has it ever made sense in the styles? I know how to change the styles, Dave. I know how. Well, that's not the problem. What would I change the style to? Am I taking crazy pills? Hang on.

02:02:35
<transcript>: What's going on here.

02:02:40
<transcript>: David Solsink, this ball.

02:02:48
<transcript>: Dave, I know how to change your styles of an element. That doesn't help me, though. I don't need to change the styles of that SVG. It's already displayed. What are you saying.

02:02:52
<transcript>: Code a code 675 thanks so much for follow.

02:02:52
<transcript>: could someone

02:02:53
recyclepoopandeatit: always bro html css is so cool

02:02:53
nofhto: the camera is sooo smooth

02:02:54
<transcript>: Could someone please.

02:02:54
<transcript>: explain to me

02:02:55
<transcript>: Explain to me.

02:02:55
<transcript>: why

02:02:57
<transcript>: Why that would help.

02:02:58
stanislausdp: overflow: fuckcss

02:03:02
shiftlessatol: the background is not

02:03:03
<transcript>: Camera is so smooth thanks Naft Nah Nas NASA to.

02:03:03
<transcript>: also welcome to june

02:03:04
microg0d: nice camera

02:03:07
<transcript>: Also welcome to June chat. Also welcome to Chat stand.

02:03:11
allcliffs: @adamdotdev is your url("#id") wrong because you have <svg><use></use></svg> so you have  <svg><svg></svg></svg> so the path is wrong ?

02:03:14
stanislausdp: hello :)

02:03:14
<transcript>: First time chat, micro, geography, nice camera. Welcome to Chat, all of you. Thank you. Yes, it's a nice camera.

02:03:14
<transcript>: is your url

02:03:18
shiftlessatol: modify the style in order to determine what the app is not doing

02:03:20
<transcript>: Is your URL ID rom because you have sugus so you have sugar. Sug.

02:03:24
shiftlessatol: that you can do manually in illustrator

02:03:24
<transcript>: So the path is wrong. Now that's something I can look at. Here.

02:03:33
nofhto: i just arrived, whats going on?

02:03:34
<transcript>: So.

02:03:34
<transcript>: dave

02:03:44
<transcript>: Dave The There's no style to modify. The SVG is literally just an SG tag with one tag in it. It's a used tag, and it has an Href pointing at the.

02:03:44
<transcript>: element

02:03:46
<transcript>: Element.

02:03:48
<transcript>: Inside.

02:03:48
<transcript>: the svg

02:03:50
<transcript>: The SVG that I want to render.

02:03:54
<transcript>: It's an SVG Sprite. Right.

02:04:00
<transcript>: And there's no style involved. That is my problem.

02:04:02
shiftlessatol: but something is stripping the gradients

02:04:12
<transcript>: Nafta. We're trying to use SUG sprites. And something is stripping the gradients. It's not that it's stripping the gradient. It's that it's like it can't reference it. Let's look at what.

02:04:15
<transcript>: Let's look at what all cliffs is saying is your URL.

02:04:15
<transcript>: pound

02:04:15
recyclepoopandeatit: what going on really?

02:04:21
<transcript>: Pound ID rom because you have SVG use SVG so you have SVGs.

02:04:23
<transcript>: Maybe.

02:04:26
<transcript>: Maybe let's look.

02:04:31
<transcript>: So this is the syntax for using an SVG Sprite.

02:04:38
<transcript>: We have the SVG tag and then use and then the href.

02:04:38
<transcript>: points at the

02:04:40
<transcript>: Points at the ID.

02:04:40
<transcript>: of

02:04:43
<transcript>: Of the what are they called the thing.

02:04:53
<transcript>: The symbol inside the Sprite that we want to render that we want to be choosing right. But we have to also point it to the URL.

02:04:53
<transcript>: of the

02:05:07
<transcript>: Of the Sprite SUG because we're actually outputting the file. That was the whole thing we tried to do this morning like this was all working. When we just bundled the Sprite into the JavaScript bundle. I don't want to do that. I want to do them externally. So we figured out how to extract the Sprite as an SVG file.

02:05:12
<transcript>: But now we're not getting backgrounds. So we're not going to background.

02:05:12
<transcript>: hassan

02:05:13
<transcript>: Hassan.

02:05:13
<transcript>: and

02:05:16
<transcript>: And Cosmon. And Thomas.

02:05:20
<transcript>: Okay. So here is.

02:05:28
<transcript>: Here is the inside of that SDG file, this SVG Sprite file.

02:05:28
<transcript>: it

02:05:31
<transcript>: It's got a style block here.

02:05:31
<transcript>: sprite sy

02:05:37
<transcript>: Sprite symbol usage display none, but then target display inline. So we are displaying.

02:05:42
<transcript>: Whatever the target is, I don't really understand.

02:05:50
<transcript>: How sprites work? I don't know. I don't know. I just know that's how they. That's how you use them. You say I want to use this symbol.

02:05:50
<transcript>: the grad

02:05:51
stanislausdp: feels like the bundling and the sprite extraction took different steps or... something

02:05:55
allcliffs: @adamdotdev so when you reference the symbol, the linear id element is not included

02:05:55
<transcript>: The gradients are defined here alongside the symbols.

02:05:55
<transcript>: they have

02:05:57
<transcript>: They have an ID.

02:05:57
recyclepoopandeatit: change inline property

02:06:00
<transcript>: And inside the symbol we've got.

02:06:00
<transcript>: a

02:06:00
bausmeier: Target is the #xyz in the url.

02:06:04
<transcript>: A path that's trying to use that fill here.

02:06:13
<transcript>: Right as a gradient. So if I changed if I change this gradient to just be like Fill, black.

02:06:16
<transcript>: Okay.

02:06:23
<transcript>: Well, that one's not displayed right now, so I'd have to actually make this symbol.

02:06:30
<transcript>: Now that one works, how would I make the symbol visible at right now.

02:06:42
bausmeier: Hello by the way. Missed the last few streams.

02:06:44
<transcript>: I don't know. I don't know how it make that spray. I was trying to just see if I could render.

02:06:44
<transcript>: what did we do

02:06:47
recyclepoopandeatit: fill black

02:06:48
<transcript>: What did we do earlier? Oh, we can done here. And we said.

02:06:52
<transcript>: Yeah, here. We said in line.

02:06:52
<transcript>: right

02:06:53
<transcript>: Right.

02:06:53
<transcript>: but then

02:06:56
<transcript>: But then what is this? 10? Two, a, four.

02:07:01
<transcript>: Zero to a four, so I can delete that.

02:07:13
<transcript>: That's fine. This linear gradient right here or no, I changed. I changed this symbol. Right? I said the fill here should be black.

02:07:17
<transcript>: That didn't affect it, though? What am I missing.

02:07:23
<transcript>: So when you reference. Okay, let's see. Feels like.

02:07:27
<transcript>: The bundling and the Spry distraction took different steps or something. Yeah.

02:07:30
shiftlessatol: that's not the thign

02:07:36
<transcript>: So when you reference the symbol, the linear ID element is not included when you reference the symbol.

02:07:41
<transcript>: The linear ID element is not included.

02:07:51
<transcript>: Change in line property. Target is Xi D in the URL. Hello, by the way, Bals is here. Miss lashu shoes. That's all right, fill black. That's not the thing.

02:07:53
<transcript>: Okay.

02:07:59
<transcript>: So when you.

02:08:06
<transcript>: When you reference the symbol, the linear ID element is not included.

02:08:06
<transcript>: you're saying i

02:08:09
<transcript>: You're saying I should be like here.

02:08:11
<transcript>: This should be.

02:08:15
<transcript>: Somehow I should be.

02:08:21
<transcript>: Including the linear ID in this should I be using it as well.

02:08:21
<transcript>: i

02:08:26
<transcript>: I don't know what the. Oh, I do know what the idea is. Hey, interesting.

02:08:37
<transcript>: They're all the same ID. Right. The gradients are the they're just underscore a so can I just, like, use the gradient to watch this. Let's try this.

02:08:42
shiftlessatol: these are all stacked layers that are turned on and off - the turning on and off is turning on and off the white patths

02:08:48
shiftlessatol: but not doing so for the gradients

02:08:55
<transcript>: Instead of usage. This one's going to be.

02:08:55
<transcript>: what

02:08:56
<transcript>: What.

02:08:56
<transcript>: 's going on

02:09:06
nexxeln: heyoo

02:09:06
<transcript>: 's going on? I I swear, like, am I actually hitting keys that are wrong? Or is everything broken to today? Okay. That's.

02:09:06
<transcript>: a

02:09:08
<transcript>: A. Okay.

02:09:08
<transcript>: use

02:09:11
<transcript>: Use both those things. Maybe.

02:09:16
<transcript>: I'm using the background. Oh, did something.

02:09:22
<transcript>: Let me make sure that's not just that icon is weird, okay? It didn't do anything. Now.

02:09:27
<transcript>: Use Sprite. Sug did I get the name wrong? Did I get the ID wrong.

02:09:33
<transcript>: That's it right. It's just the ID with the underscore a. Those are the gradients.

02:09:48
<transcript>: These are all stacked layers that are turned on and off. The turning on and off is turning on and off the whole the white pads but not doing so for the gradient.

02:09:54
<transcript>: Next is here. Hey, next. Hey. At the beginning of the stream, I explained that we went back to the T three stack.

02:09:54
<transcript>: yesterday was

02:09:59
<transcript>: Yesterday was dumb. It was a waste of 5 hours, but I learned something so it wasn't wait.

02:10:02
nexxeln: oh coool

02:10:05
<transcript>: But I don't have time to rewrite this whole app, and that was dumb. So reason. Two, three.

02:10:11
<transcript>: So it's not turning on.

02:10:11
nexxeln: we have a huge announcement today

02:10:15
<transcript>: It's like the symbol needs to include.

02:10:20
<transcript>: The linear gradient. I don't understand. I just don't understand.

02:10:31
<transcript>: I don't see why this wouldn't work. I see here. Where this path? What if I don't have this silk nun here.

02:10:34
barryxbtw: is it secret

02:10:37
<transcript>: That's not one of my talking about. That's not gonna change anything.

02:10:40
<transcript>: Past fill.

02:10:40
<transcript>: url

02:10:42
<transcript>: Url, and then.

02:10:51
<transcript>: You have a huge announcement today.

02:10:51
nexxeln: oh hi barry

02:10:51
barryxbtw: oh i know what it is nvm

02:10:52
shiftlessatol: 1 stars for this filter do not recommend for screen share

02:10:53
<transcript>: What's the announcement next.

02:10:55
barryxbtw: yh hello

02:10:57
<transcript>: Is it the new website.

02:11:01
barryxbtw: yh

02:11:04
<transcript>: One stars for this filter. Do not recommend for screen share. Yeah, yeah, it messes up my Chroma key.

02:11:06
nexxeln: yeah

02:11:15
<transcript>: It's not turning on. So like right here. Oh, look at that.

02:11:15
<transcript>: look at that

02:11:18
<transcript>: Look at that. Look at that. Hang on, go back.

02:11:21
<transcript>: Did you see that.

02:11:23
<transcript>: Element.

02:11:27
<transcript>: I could click on here so path attribute fill.

02:11:32
<transcript>: Is this and I can click on it. It's linked to that thing.

02:11:44
<transcript>: Which just takes me to the whole Sprite. Oh, is that the problem? Should it actually be taking me directly to a thing that it's just not because it's the reference is broken or something.

02:11:49
<transcript>: Is that what's going on? What if I changed.

02:11:53
shiftlessatol: #2

02:11:54
<transcript>: What if I change this URL to have the file name as well? Is that what you were trying to say.

02:11:54
<transcript>: that might be

02:11:58
<transcript>: That might be what that might be what you were trying to say? All cliffs.

02:12:01
<transcript>: That we were trying to say.

02:12:01
<transcript>: reference

02:12:05
<transcript>: Reference the symbol the linear ID element is not included.

02:12:08
<transcript>: Let's try.

02:12:11
<transcript>: What if we said this.

02:12:11
<transcript>: was

02:12:13
<transcript>: Was you are.

02:12:16
<transcript>: Next.

02:12:18
<transcript>: Static.

02:12:19
<transcript>: Right.

02:12:19
<transcript>: svg

02:12:21
<transcript>: Svg.

02:12:23
<transcript>: Then that.

02:12:24
allcliffs: try

02:12:25
<transcript>: If we did that.

02:12:28
<transcript>: Now let's turn the symbol on.

02:12:30
<transcript>: User to this one.

02:12:37
<transcript>: What did it do? Nothing.

02:12:39
<transcript>: Did nothing.

02:12:42
<transcript>: Let's see here.

02:12:46
<transcript>: The fill now is like that.

02:12:50
<transcript>: Okay.

02:12:50
shiftlessatol: it doesn't work like that

02:12:52
<transcript>: So not that way.

02:12:52
<transcript>: next

02:12:54
<transcript>: Next bright SVG.

02:12:59
<transcript>: It doesn't work like that. I'm seeing that all. Cliffs.

02:13:05
<transcript>: Try, try something? Try what? I just tried.

02:13:08
<transcript>: Unsuccessfully.

02:13:19
<transcript>: So clearly it doesn't work like that.

02:13:21
shiftlessatol: you in a completely different area of the SVG

02:13:27
<transcript>: Let's do this.

02:13:28
shiftlessatol: you need to modify the actual layer

02:13:31
<transcript>: Svg spring.

02:13:33
<transcript>: Linear gradient.

02:13:35
<transcript>: Are all broken.

02:13:42
<transcript>: How do I not search this earlier if this is like a common.

02:13:56
<transcript>: Our issue.

02:14:08
<transcript>: In Chrome.

02:14:08
<transcript>: oh is this

02:14:11
<transcript>: Oh, is this just a Chromebook hang on.

02:14:16
<transcript>: Hang on.

02:14:23
<transcript>: Oh, my word. It works in Firefox. This is a Chrome thing, specifically.

02:14:25
<transcript>: Okay. That might be a workaround.

02:14:25
<transcript>: also firefox

02:14:28
<transcript>: Also Firefox the layout very broken.

02:14:31
<transcript>: Turns out.

02:14:33
<transcript>: Okay, we were all wrong.

02:14:33
<transcript>: it

02:14:37
<transcript>: It's something very specific and odd.

02:14:45
barryxbtw: well that was that hour

02:14:45
<transcript>: And longhang bug report.

02:14:53
<transcript>: Need to have the element and the resources inside the same file. What.

02:14:59
<transcript>: We can go back and.

02:15:07
<transcript>: Delete this. Nope.

02:15:08
allcliffs: so it works in FF ?

02:15:09
<transcript>: What just happened.

02:15:20
<transcript>: That's the that's the path.

02:15:21
daglee: Parts works in Fx

02:15:25
<transcript>: If you feel like I shouldn't have to say.

02:15:40
<transcript>: It works in Firefox. Yeah.

02:15:45
barryxbtw: I think its just /static

02:15:48
<transcript>: It works in Firefox, but there's other issues in Firefox.

02:15:49
barryxbtw: The / is important

02:15:57
<transcript>: We're gonna try and figure out the workaround.

02:15:58
barryxbtw: Or that might point to static

02:16:02
<transcript>: For now.

02:16:02
barryxbtw: So /sprite.svg

02:16:07
<transcript>: Need to have the element and the resources inside the same file.

02:16:13
<transcript>: Element and the resources. What are they talking about.

02:16:24
<transcript>: Okay, I have an SUG represents a Google, a Sore badge.

02:16:28
<transcript>: Promokers when I put that SUG in a Sprite.

02:16:43
<transcript>: If you open up your newly created index, HTML works perfectly, and if Firefox and Chrome it does not work at all. Great is completely missing.

02:16:48
<transcript>: Am I doing something wrong? Changing the sources to do with the badges. An option for me. Here.

02:16:57
<transcript>: New Intel this only happens if we have an external Sprite file if the Spring file is included in line in the same page as the Sprite inclusion.

02:17:01
privann: Hellllo

02:17:02
<transcript>: It works in Chrome. So if the SVG is inline.

02:17:12
<transcript>: The slash is important. I think it's just static.

02:17:18
<transcript>: I think.

02:17:23
shiftlessatol: *pukes*

02:17:24
<transcript>: I think I can just continue to use the next static.

02:17:31
<transcript>: And it's fine. Just. It looked weird to me. Like this looks super weird to me. I think it works.

02:17:31
<transcript>: let's make sure

02:17:35
<transcript>: Let's make sure it works with Pnpm. Run, build.

02:17:37
<transcript>: Pmpm, Run start.

02:17:47
<transcript>: Okay. We've made Dave Puke. So that's where we're at in today's stream.

02:17:54
<transcript>: How can I refer to an internal graded definition? Let's say SVG broken in Chrome.

02:17:57
<transcript>: We can find a better workaround.

02:18:33
<transcript>: Hey.

02:18:37
<transcript>: Death should be combined and not within each symbol.

02:18:41
<transcript>: What.

02:18:47
shiftlessatol: side note:: how to get a public.dev beta key?

02:18:58
<transcript>: Oh, what a bummer.

02:19:12
<transcript>: Possible configuration all the gradients.

02:19:14
<transcript>: Into this block.

02:19:29
<transcript>: Dev.

02:19:29
<transcript>: devon's easy

02:19:29
adamdotdev: !betakey

02:19:29
fossabot: Use beta key `adamisontwitch2` after signing up at public.dev.

02:19:30
<transcript>: Devon's, easy.

02:19:32
<transcript>: Like that.

02:19:33
privann: Cloudflare D1 is in alpha nu

02:19:36
privann: now *

02:19:38
privann: coool

02:19:41
<transcript>: How can I refer to an internal gradient definition from inside.

02:19:41
<transcript>: and

02:19:44
<transcript>: And SUG Sprite. Symbol.

02:20:14
<transcript>: Gradient fills when the whole SDG block is marked with style display none if the styles remove the gradient rendered properly.

02:20:24
<transcript>: Oh.

02:20:41
<transcript>: Visibility hidden or Pesi zero boast allow the gradient turned it properly. Obviously they don't offer purpose solutions, though, as they still Demark it the space that this would you would have taken up if visible. That's not good.

02:20:49
<transcript>: After scubbing all this I was pretty sure it would be no problem.

02:21:02
<transcript>: All you need to do is wrap the entire SUG code in a Div container.

02:21:06
<transcript>: Which messed but will never affect layout.

02:21:06
<transcript>: why

02:21:08
<transcript>: Why.

02:21:11
<transcript>: I'm confused.

02:21:14
<transcript>: You're saying if I wrap.

02:21:14
<transcript>: the entire

02:21:18
<transcript>: The entire SVG code. So this one.

02:21:18
<transcript>: it's already

02:21:21
<transcript>: It's already in a Div. So if I take this Div.

02:21:25
<transcript>: Let's wrap it in another Div.

02:21:28
<transcript>: I don't think this is gonna work, but.

02:21:35
<transcript>: This seems like it's not gonna work. I don't know.

02:21:38
<transcript>: Class.

02:21:38
<transcript>: name

02:21:39
<transcript>: Name.

02:21:42
<transcript>: With zero.

02:21:42
<transcript>: absolute

02:21:43
<transcript>: Absolute.

02:21:47
<transcript>: Hidden.

02:21:47
<transcript>: what is this doing

02:21:48
<transcript>: What is this doing.

02:21:50
allcliffs: see his fiddle

02:21:54
<transcript>: Here's a fiddle. Let's see.

02:22:05
<transcript>: What.

02:22:05
<transcript>: see you settle

02:22:06
<transcript>: See you settle.

02:22:10
<transcript>: This style. And then the SVG.

02:22:12
<transcript>: Linear gradient.

02:22:21
<transcript>: And then what's happening down here.

02:22:25
<transcript>: So here's the SVGs.

02:22:27
<transcript>: Link.

02:22:27
<transcript>: and there

02:22:30
<transcript>: And there's source. Wait. What.

02:22:33
<transcript>: What's this source.

02:22:47
<transcript>: So the it's actually the source SDG that needs to be wrapped in this Div is what they're saying.

02:22:51
<transcript>: Not.

02:22:57
<transcript>: These SVGs that do the use right.

02:22:57
<transcript>: okay

02:23:02
<transcript>: Okay. So let's say I could let's just let's manually edit it here.

02:23:05
<transcript>: This is so dumb.

02:23:05
<transcript>: this

02:23:10
<transcript>: This is so dumb. So let's go in here. I'm going to.

02:23:10
<transcript>: first of all

02:23:17
<transcript>: First of all, did I test it using the actual production server? Is it actually even rendering? Yeah. Okay.

02:23:17
shiftlessatol: https://github.com/elrumordelaluz/svgsprit.es/issues/9#issuecomment-707198321

02:23:21
<transcript>: So let's get back to the Dev server.

02:23:25
<transcript>: Ah.

02:23:30
<transcript>: Remove Where's all that stuff I just did.

02:23:30
<transcript>: out here

02:23:32
<transcript>: Out here.

02:23:38
<transcript>: Okay. So removing that and let's go in here.

02:23:41
<transcript>: I need to start the Dev server.

02:23:42
recyclepoopandeatit: front-end is so shit really , less abt algorithm and more garbage gif svgs and ssr or csr bullshitt

02:23:49
<transcript>: Yeah. The front ends. The worst.

02:23:56
<transcript>: Yeah, I just hate it. I think that's the takeaway here. Just hate the front end. That's all.

02:23:58
<transcript>: I just hate it.

02:24:01
<transcript>: Now we've got this static.

02:24:04
<transcript>: It didn't create it. Why didn't it create it.

02:24:08
<transcript>: Like, Why do I have it open? I have it open.

02:24:10
<transcript>: I don't.

02:24:11
allcliffs: @recyclepoopandeatit that is because you have so much history on all sorts decisions

02:24:14
<transcript>: I had it open, but I don't anymore. Right.

02:24:20
<transcript>: Do I have the SVG open somehow and it can't create it.

02:24:27
<transcript>: What.

02:24:27
<transcript>: we're

02:24:30
<transcript>: We're back here again. Remove.

02:24:30
<transcript>: next

02:24:31
<transcript>: Next.

02:24:48
<transcript>: Okay.

02:24:48
<transcript>: let's look

02:24:50
allcliffs: @adamdotdev maybe just replace linearbgs with static bgs ?

02:24:50
<transcript>: Let's look at the.

02:24:55
<transcript>: Sprite. File. Let's see if I can manually edit it.

02:24:59
<transcript>: Open with Text mate.

02:24:59
<transcript>: so we're gonna

02:25:01
<transcript>: So we're gonna wrap this.

02:25:01
<transcript>: somehow

02:25:10
shiftlessatol: try  fill: var(the stuffs)

02:25:13
<transcript>: Somehow this is so dumb. I don't understand how this would hurt, how this would help. I think the reason it works in this case in Chrome is because they've defined it in line here, just like it says.

02:25:13
<transcript>: you had to

02:25:16
<transcript>: You had to do in Chrome, right.

02:25:18
<transcript>: But let's say we did this.

02:25:21
<transcript>: Let's say we did this.

02:25:24
<transcript>: This isn't an SVG file anymore. Right.

02:25:27
<transcript>: We got it saved in.

02:25:31
<transcript>: Scg file. It's not an SVG.

02:25:33
<transcript>: It's a Div.

02:25:36
<transcript>: divit

02:25:37
<transcript>: Divit.

02:25:41
<transcript>: I'm gonna try it.

02:25:48
<transcript>: Let's go to network tab and see if it.

02:25:52
<transcript>: Has.

02:25:52
<transcript>: the

02:25:55
<transcript>: The yeah, it's got the Div on there.

02:26:03
<transcript>: That didn't change anything.

02:26:08
<transcript>: That is because.

02:26:08
<transcript>: you have so much

02:26:11
<transcript>: You have so much history on all sorts of decisions.

02:26:15
<transcript>: Maybe just replace linear BGS with static background.

02:26:23
<transcript>: The problem with that one, I have to do that like I have to manually go through.

02:26:23
<transcript>: all

02:26:33
<transcript>: All the source Sugs from AWS and actually replace the fills, but then also it's just not what the logos look like, right.

02:26:34
<transcript>: Try, fill.

02:26:34
<transcript>: var

02:26:38
<transcript>: Var the stuff. What does that mean? Dave.

02:26:46
<transcript>: What does that mean.

02:26:49
<transcript>: So I'm surprised it actually even let me.

02:26:52
<transcript>: Put that Div around it.

02:26:53
shiftlessatol: for the style

02:27:00
shiftlessatol: https://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/07/16/styling-svg-use-content-css/

02:27:01
<transcript>: So let's go, let's go to this one.

02:27:09
<transcript>: How's I seeing that earlier.

02:27:20
<transcript>: Like I was able to click on it somewhere. Or was that.

02:27:32
<transcript>: How did I do that earlier? Did anyone see where I was able to click on the.

02:27:36
<transcript>: Layout.

02:27:41
<transcript>: Am I going crazy? I think I'm going crazy today. I think that's what's going on.

02:27:48
<transcript>: Styling SUG Use Content CSS.

02:27:48
<transcript>: okay

02:27:53
<transcript>: Okay, we know what the issue is. It's a Chrome issue. I just need a workaround.

02:27:53
<transcript>: if there is

02:27:57
<transcript>: If there is a workaround that's not inlining the file in the HTML.

02:28:06
<transcript>: Right.

02:28:08
shiftlessatol: that's the work around

02:28:10
<transcript>: I just need to work around.

02:28:25
<transcript>: Display none.

02:28:25
<transcript>: oh

02:28:30
<transcript>: Oh, I got changed something else. So I added the okay. Okay.

02:28:30
<transcript>: does that actually work

02:28:33
<transcript>: Does that actually work? I think this might actually work.

02:28:39
<transcript>: Back in here.

02:28:42
<transcript>: Open that with Text mate.

02:28:48
<transcript>: I think this is actually work. I don't know why I think it might actually work, but I think it might actually work.

02:28:54
<transcript>: So up here, we're gonna remove.

02:28:54
<transcript>: this

02:28:55
<transcript>: This.

02:28:58
<transcript>: Change it to inline as well.

02:29:04
<transcript>: And then let's reload.

02:29:14
<transcript>: Okay. Did not work. Did it get the updated file though.

02:29:26
<transcript>: I guess I needed to look at the network tab.

02:29:34
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

02:29:36
<transcript>: Display.

02:29:39
<transcript>: None was not.

02:29:39
<transcript>: in there now

02:29:40
<transcript>: In there now.

02:29:45
phojiee: is that tailwind? how did you do the text-orange-9? instead of 900 ?. sorry new to tw

02:29:52
<transcript>: Yeah, it's till wind.

02:29:58
<transcript>: In the 900, I've got a custom color palette in there based on radddock's colors.

02:29:58
<transcript>: what's the

02:30:00
<transcript>: What's the Workground.

02:30:02
<transcript>: I'm copying this. Dave.

02:30:06
<transcript>: Styling SUG.

02:30:07
<transcript>: sugss

02:30:08
<transcript>: Sugss.

02:30:37
<transcript>: I'm confused.

02:30:42
<transcript>: Override presentation attributes.

02:30:47
<transcript>: So I can set a class.

02:30:47
<transcript>: that overrides

02:30:48
shiftlessatol: keep scrolling

02:30:49
<transcript>: That overrides.

02:30:49
<transcript>: the fill

02:30:53
<transcript>: The fill. I. But how would I keep track of that? Like I can't keep track of.

02:30:53
<transcript>: the

02:30:57
<transcript>: The gradients outside of the actual SVG file, right.

02:31:00
<transcript>: I don't know.

02:31:00
<transcript>: i don't know

02:31:02
<transcript>: I don't know this helps me.

02:31:09
<transcript>: If this is a workaround, it's really long and I don't know how this is. Take anything out of it.

02:31:13
<transcript>: Keep scrolling.

02:31:15
shiftlessatol: the end

02:31:17
<transcript>: For how long, Dave? How long do I keep scrolling.

02:31:21
shiftlessatol: there

02:31:22
<transcript>: What am I looking for? Like this is this is a huge giant article. What am I gonna get out of this.

02:31:25
shiftlessatol: the robot

02:31:30
<transcript>: I don't know. There's a lot of stuff in here. A lot of information.

02:31:35
<transcript>: But I'm not really taking anything away from it.

02:31:39
<transcript>: Okay. Okay.

02:31:58
<transcript>: So they got this working. I think this has to do with the actual SUG being in line in the same file. That's what we just read that this bug doesn't exist if you do exactly what they just did. So I don't know if that's an unrelated bug they fix.

02:32:09
<transcript>: I need is wrap the entire SD code in a Div container must be displayed but will never affect layout.

02:32:23
shiftlessatol: you can force the css to apply the gradient

02:32:26
<transcript>: This version says it's not rendering in Firefox.

02:32:30
<transcript>: You can force the CSS to apply the gradient.

02:32:30
<transcript>: how

02:32:34
<transcript>: How can I do that, Dave? Can you give me like a oneliner and then.

02:32:37
<transcript>: 150 word article.

02:32:38
<transcript>: Three weeks.

02:32:38
<transcript>: browser cons

02:32:40
<transcript>: Browser consistencies.

02:32:51
<transcript>: Svg. Sprite. Gradient.

02:32:55
<transcript>: Broken in Chrome.

02:32:57
shiftlessatol: yes fill:var(the fill )

02:33:05
<transcript>: Var. Phil.

02:33:05
<transcript>: or phil

02:33:08
<transcript>: Or Phil. Phil VAR. The film.

02:33:15
<transcript>: But, Dave, I don't know. The fills. The fills are inside, like they are in the SUG file.

02:33:15
<transcript>: so like

02:33:18
<transcript>: So, like, Where am I? Where am I doing that.

02:33:22
<transcript>: Where am I setting a variable for each gradient in doing that.

02:33:25
<transcript>: Like you're saying, I'm modifying the SVG.

02:33:28
shiftlessatol: you're not

02:33:30
<transcript>: I'm not even creating this SUG it's generated for me.

02:33:35
shiftlessatol: you will use the svg as the fill

02:33:36
<transcript>: Okay, here's. Chrome.

02:33:36
<transcript>: and problems

02:33:39
<transcript>: And problems with the desk tag nested inside the symbol tag.

02:33:46
<transcript>: Did not render the contents inside those desks Tags correctly.

02:33:46
<transcript>: you know

02:33:50
<transcript>: You know, I should also just search this SUG spriteloader.

02:33:50
<transcript>: for chrome

02:33:53
<transcript>: For Chrome See if anybody's missing issues.

02:33:56
<transcript>: Not working.

02:34:41
<transcript>: Is referenced in CSS.

02:34:45
<transcript>: I need to reference it and see.

02:34:45
<transcript>: how

02:34:48
shiftlessatol: change from inline to block

02:34:48
<transcript>: How would I reference the CSS.

02:34:48
<transcript>: of this su

02:34:50
<transcript>: Of this SUG and CSS.

02:34:50
grasp5533: Hey everyone

02:34:56
<transcript>: You will use the SDG as the fill change from inline to block.

02:34:56
<transcript>: hey

02:34:59
<transcript>: Hey, Graph. What's going on in grasp.

02:35:03
<transcript>: Change from inline to block.

02:35:03
<transcript>: so you're saying

02:35:05
shiftlessatol: the gradient may be to the right of the path

02:35:05
<transcript>: So you're saying Edit this again.

02:35:08
<transcript>: Change it from inline.

02:35:11
<transcript>: Block.

02:35:14
shiftlessatol: on both

02:35:30
shiftlessatol: the gradent also

02:35:36
<transcript>: No dice, Dave. No dice gradient. Maybe to the right of the path on both. No, listen. I know why the grain inside is blade. It's a Chromebook. I know why it's not displayed. I don't need to figure out why it's not displayed. It's not a CSS issue. It's a Chromebook. And I need to figure out the Workground for.

02:35:36
<transcript>: that chromebook

02:35:38
<transcript>: That Chromebook.

02:35:39
<transcript>: Okay.

02:35:39
<transcript>: chrome cutting off

02:35:43
<transcript>: Chrome cutting off icons from Sugar Sprites great is not working in Firefox.

02:35:48
<transcript>: Interesting to say gradients not working at Firefox.

02:35:59
<transcript>: Moving the desks.

02:36:10
<transcript>: This is such a mess. Some people have issues with Firefox mine works in Firefox.

02:36:11
j_c___: why can't the svg be inline?

02:36:13
<transcript>: Want to bring this over here.

02:36:14
alvee__: what is that font in nvim?

02:36:18
<transcript>: Bring this over here.

02:36:20
<transcript>: Mine works.

02:36:20
<transcript>: fire

02:36:27
<transcript>: Firefox, ignore all the other layout issues in Firefox, which apparently I need fix as well. Man, I hate the browser, man, I hate the web.

02:36:30
<transcript>: Why do I work on web stuff.

02:36:34
<transcript>: See the gradients work in firefights just fine.

02:36:34
<transcript>: it's not a

02:36:36
<transcript>: It's not a CSS issue.

02:36:36
<transcript>: it's an issue

02:36:37
<transcript>: It's an issue.

02:36:37
<transcript>: it's an

02:36:40
<transcript>: It's an Idiosyncrasy within Chrome.

02:36:40
<transcript>: and

02:36:42
<transcript>: And SUG sprites.

02:36:42
<transcript>: and

02:36:44
<transcript>: And I need to figure out.

02:36:44
<transcript>: if i need

02:36:49
<transcript>: If I need to create if I need to hand create a Sprite if this Sprite loader is just not gonna do it.

02:36:49
<transcript>: i

02:36:52
<transcript>: I like the idea of it.

02:36:54
<transcript>: Do not populate.

02:37:00
<transcript>: Sugar.

02:37:04
<transcript>: Sprite is broken.

02:37:16
<transcript>: What do they say? Not working in Chrome.

02:37:19
01_pollux: wiat what are the glases reflecting when you move?

02:37:34
<transcript>: What is the font? It's operator. Mono.

02:37:48
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat JC. Why can't the SDGB inline? I guess I can. So here's the thing. It's a giant file. It's like, well, let's just see it's. 566 KB uncompressed.

02:37:48
<transcript>: it's a giant

02:38:08
<transcript>: It's a giant Sprite. It has over 300 AWS logos in it. And if I inline it in the page, then I'm losing all the benefits. I can use this webpack plugin and just have it bundled the Sprite bundled into the JavaScript bundle. And that works. I have no issues on Chrome. Everything works. It just means every time I make a change to the app, people are gonna have to read.

02:38:08
<transcript>: download

02:38:11
tsoutsou_proutsou: split them :/

02:38:17
<transcript>: Download that giant bundle instead of having the Sprite file separate where that can be cached in the browsers separately. I'd love for the Sprite file to just be cashed.

02:38:17
<transcript>: you know i'm saying

02:38:19
<transcript>: You know, I'm saying.

02:38:19
<transcript>: if i inline

02:38:25
<transcript>: If I inline it in the HTML, then I have the same problem like now every time the page changes when I make changes to the app.

02:38:25
<transcript>: they're having to

02:38:26
tsoutsou_proutsou: and lazy load them

02:38:30
<transcript>: They're having to redownload that whole Sprite thing. So it's an optimization.

02:38:30
<transcript>: also

02:38:32
<transcript>: Also welcome to Chat Aldi.

02:38:36
<transcript>: Wait, what are the glasses reflecting when you move.

02:38:40
<transcript>: I don't know. What are they reflecting.

02:38:44
<transcript>: Ha How's that work.

02:38:44
<transcript>: i really

02:38:44
allcliffs: @adamdotdev can you try this silly thing:  can you rename linearGradient id to a short id like "a123" and reference "a123" ?

02:38:46
<transcript>: I really don't know.

02:38:49
<transcript>: I don't know what it's reflecting.

02:38:52
<transcript>: It's interesting, though.

02:38:52
<transcript>: so

02:38:54
shiftlessatol: I think it's John Lenon

02:38:56
<transcript>: So split them and LazyLoad them. That's a good idea tootsuit. Su. Now we're talking.

02:38:58
<transcript>: Now we're talking.

02:39:00
01_pollux: i think they added a picture inside

02:39:03
01_pollux: hmm

02:39:05
<transcript>: Can you try this silly thing? Can you rename linear gradient ID to short ID like a one, two, three, and reference a one, two, three.

02:39:05
<transcript>: like no

02:39:08
<transcript>: Like no underscore. I can try that.

02:39:08
01_pollux: i saw a man

02:39:10
<transcript>: I can try that.

02:39:18
cr4xr3v: reflecting self

02:39:20
shiftlessatol: Lennon*

02:39:21
<transcript>: They added a picture inside. Is there a man in there.

02:39:25
<transcript>: Inside this filter you all see a man.

02:39:28
<transcript>: Let's do this so you can see.

02:39:32
<transcript>: It's kind of creepy if there's a man in there.

02:39:52
<transcript>: Okay, so all Cliffs says try Rename linear gradient ID to a short ID. Like a one, two, three. Let's try it. We got nothing to lose.

02:39:54
<transcript>: Open with.

02:39:57
<transcript>: Text, meat.

02:40:01
<transcript>: The problem is like I have to find the right one.

02:40:01
<transcript>: so

02:40:04
<transcript>: So like this ID.

02:40:08
<transcript>: And it won't be the same.

02:40:08
<transcript>: you know i'm saying

02:40:10
<transcript>: You know, I'm saying like.

02:40:13
<transcript>: I guess I can hard.

02:40:13
<transcript>: i can

02:40:18
<transcript>: I can hard code it. So let's hard code to one of the first one. This one.

02:40:24
<transcript>: Okay, turn it off you by for a second.

02:40:32
<transcript>: Here we can just say.

02:40:45
<transcript>: Now we're hardcoding it to you. That one specifically.

02:40:48
<transcript>: Should be the first one.

02:40:53
<transcript>: In the file is right there. Now we're gonna change it.

02:40:56
<transcript>: Display? None. So it's getting overwritten.

02:40:56
<transcript>: oh that got

02:41:00
<transcript>: Oh, that got overwritten. Okay. Did I restart the thing? I don't know.

02:41:00
<transcript>: symbol

02:41:03
<transcript>: Symbol here, we're gonna say.

02:41:03
<transcript>: the

02:41:04
<transcript>: The.

02:41:09
<transcript>: Fill is gonna be one, two, three.

02:41:09
<transcript>: and then we

02:41:11
<transcript>: And then we got to find it down here.

02:41:15
<transcript>: It's gonna be linear gradient. Right here. No, that's not it.

02:41:18
<transcript>: Linear. Written right here.

02:41:18
<transcript>: one

02:41:20
<transcript>: One, two, three.

02:41:20
<transcript>: you're

02:41:22
<transcript>: You're saying just try like that.

02:41:27
<transcript>: This is a silly thing, but we're gonna try it.

02:41:34
<transcript>: I did our SVG actually get rebuilt.

02:41:34
<transcript>: it's a question

02:41:35
<transcript>: It's a question.

02:41:36
shiftlessatol: BTW that is the fill that you can't find

02:41:41
<transcript>: To the urban.

02:41:43
shiftlessatol: you literally just modified

02:41:45
<transcript>: Now it's using the new URL. One, two, three.

02:41:47
<transcript>: No dice.

02:41:47
<transcript>: not

02:41:51
<transcript>: Note have been surprising if that was the issue. It's like the length of the.

02:41:53
<transcript>: Thing.

02:42:02
<transcript>: That is the fill that you can't find. You literally just modified. What do you mean.

02:42:09
<transcript>: You're saying, Dave, you're saying I could change that fill to be what it's like, hard code.

02:42:15
<transcript>: What do you say to not reference a linear gradient and just make it flat color.

02:42:22
<transcript>: Like Dave. Let me play this out with you. What are you saying I should do here? You're saying I should go in here.

02:42:24
shiftlessatol: reference the id

02:42:25
<transcript>: And instead of doing.

02:42:25
<transcript>: fill url

02:42:26
<transcript>: Fill, URL.

02:42:26
<transcript>: to type what

02:42:27
shiftlessatol: in the css

02:42:28
<transcript>: To type what I should type in there.

02:42:28
<transcript>: reference the id

02:42:31
<transcript>: Reference the ID in the CSS.

02:42:36
<transcript>: So you're saying I create a CSS file that has all of these IDs.

02:42:36
<transcript>: all three

02:42:42
<transcript>: All 300 plus A Tobis Services I've classes for each of them targeting.

02:42:46
<transcript>: Those specific IDs and duplicating the linear gradient.

02:42:46
<transcript>: that's what

02:42:47
shiftlessatol: fill="var(url(theid))

02:42:47
<transcript>: That's what you're saying to me.

02:42:47
<transcript>: and

02:42:49
shiftlessatol: "

02:42:50
<transcript>: And you're saying that will work.

02:42:53
<transcript>: Far URL the ID.

02:42:56
<transcript>: Variable.

02:42:56
<transcript>: url

02:42:59
<transcript>: Url. The ID in the CSS.

02:43:04
<transcript>: Okay, let me play this out.

02:43:04
<transcript>: i'm gonna give you

02:43:06
<transcript>: I'm gonna give you the myth of it out here, Dave.

02:43:09
shiftlessatol: try it here first

02:43:11
<transcript>: Gonna give you the benefit of the doubt.

02:43:11
<transcript>: i'm gonna play

02:43:15
<transcript>: I'm gonna play it out, let me I'm just trying to recreate my SUG file.

02:43:19
<transcript>: So let's say.

02:43:22
<transcript>: Oh.

02:43:22
<transcript>: my word

02:43:24
<transcript>: My word.

02:43:28
<transcript>: I'm gonna lose my mind today this is just ridiculous.

02:43:41
<transcript>: I think this webpack plugins is flaky as well. I think that's part of the problem.

02:43:47
<transcript>: Or do I have the Do I have it open? No, I don't have the SVG open anywhere.

02:43:51
<transcript>: Okay. So you're saying.

02:43:54
<transcript>: I could write some CSS.

02:43:57
<transcript>: That targets.

02:43:57
<transcript>: that

02:43:58
<transcript>: That specific idea.

02:43:58
<transcript>: so let's just

02:44:01
<transcript>: So let's just yank.

02:44:06
<transcript>: That word. And let's say.

02:44:06
<transcript>: let's

02:44:10
<transcript>: Let's say we had a bit of CSS here.

02:44:16
<transcript>: Wherever.

02:44:22
<transcript>: I go to my global styles, I guess.

02:44:22
<transcript>: now let's

02:44:24
<transcript>: Now let's say I had.

02:44:27
<transcript>: A class.

02:44:27
<transcript>: right here

02:44:28
tsoutsou_proutsou: i think splitting me gonna be much faster :P

02:44:28
<transcript>: Right here. First.

02:44:28
<transcript>: fill var

02:44:31
<transcript>: Fill VAR URL the ID.

02:44:31
<transcript>: what

02:44:32
<transcript>: What.

02:44:36
tsoutsou_proutsou: them*

02:44:40
<transcript>: Splitting so two, two. Are you saying manually create the sprites and splitting them.

02:44:45
<transcript>: Like creating five files that have the different sprites in them.

02:44:47
<transcript>: Manually.

02:44:49
<transcript>: And then what.

02:44:53
<transcript>: Because I still can't load them.

02:44:53
<transcript>: my chrome

02:44:54
tsoutsou_proutsou: not sprite but 178 svgs

02:44:55
<transcript>: My Chrome will still have this bug.

02:45:08
<transcript>: 178 SVGs. Oh, do this the individual suds. I mean, that's what I had originally, but then the problem with that suitsu is.

02:45:12
<transcript>: There's a delay in downloading the SVG.

02:45:12
<transcript>: okay

02:45:13
<transcript>: Okay.

02:45:13
<transcript>: there's

02:45:16
<transcript>: There's a delay when you download the SCG.

02:45:17
tsoutsou_proutsou: your render is very slow

02:45:23
tsoutsou_proutsou: and looks glitchy

02:45:28
<transcript>: In that amount of time, you're not able to answer the question because you don't even you can't see the image so it doesn't make the gameplay consistent for everybody. Your network bandwidth could affect your score, and I don't want that. Does that make sense.

02:45:28
<transcript>: my render

02:45:30
<transcript>: My render is very slow and look squishy.

02:45:34
<transcript>: Like my face.

02:45:34
<transcript>: my

02:45:36
<transcript>: My drop in frames or something.

02:45:39
<transcript>: No.

02:45:41
tsoutsou_proutsou: the page

02:45:42
<transcript>: Render is very slow.

02:45:45
tsoutsou_proutsou: when you lick new game

02:45:47
<transcript>: So, Dave, what are you saying here? You're saying fill.

02:45:49
<transcript>: Var.

02:45:49
<transcript>: no u

02:45:49
tsoutsou_proutsou: click*

02:45:51
<transcript>: No. Url. The ID.

02:45:57
<transcript>: Fill VAR. You're saying fill the whole SVG, this whole thing.

02:45:57
<transcript>: fill

02:45:58
<transcript>: Fill.

02:46:02
<transcript>: You Arel.

02:46:03
shiftlessatol: no

02:46:10
<transcript>: The ID. You're saying like this.

02:46:12
<transcript>: How are you trying to tell me.

02:46:16
allcliffs: @adamdotdev what shift is saying try <use href="sprite.svg" fill="var(url(#id)" />

02:46:18
shiftlessatol: SMH

02:46:21
<transcript>: Oh when I click new game yeah yeah it's slow to create the first thing.

02:46:21
<transcript>: no

02:46:30
<transcript>: No. What shift is saying? Try your use Ahref Sprite SVG oh on the use tag. You're saying on the use tag? So here.

02:46:33
<transcript>: Add some style.

02:46:36
<transcript>: Fill.

02:46:40
<transcript>: Bar.

02:46:40
<transcript>: url

02:46:41
<transcript>: Url.

02:46:41
<transcript>: the id

02:46:42
<transcript>: The ID.

02:46:45
<transcript>: Is that what you're saying.

02:46:48
shiftlessatol: the gradient url

02:46:51
<transcript>: Or no, not a style.

02:46:53
shiftlessatol: @allcliffs yes

02:46:56
<transcript>: Just a fill tag or a fill attribute.

02:47:04
<transcript>: So fill.

02:47:04
<transcript>: the

02:47:05
shiftlessatol: style is right

02:47:06
<transcript>: The equals.

02:47:09
<transcript>: Style is right.

02:47:09
<transcript>: var

02:47:11
<transcript>: Var.

02:47:14
<transcript>: variable

02:47:15
<transcript>: Variable.

02:47:15
<transcript>: is it

02:47:17
<transcript>: Is it Siler is it Phil.

02:47:20
<transcript>: Url.

02:47:22
<transcript>: I. D.

02:47:27
<transcript>: This is what you're saying to me.

02:47:28
shiftlessatol: in that order

02:47:31
<transcript>: I guess it's like underscore a.

02:47:34
<transcript>: aisle is right

02:47:35
<transcript>: Aisle is right in that order.

02:47:41
shiftlessatol: style="fill:var(url(ID))"

02:47:41
<transcript>: So on the use tag do style and say the fill.

02:47:41
<transcript>: is

02:47:44
<transcript>: Is VAR.

02:47:46
<transcript>: Url.

02:47:50
<transcript>: The ID.

02:47:50
<transcript>: underscore

02:47:53
<transcript>: Underscore a.

02:47:54
<transcript>: Like that.

02:48:00
<transcript>: It's not working.

02:48:04
tsoutsou_proutsou: its not #123?

02:48:08
<transcript>: Does the URL need to have the whole necks.

02:48:08
<transcript>: static

02:48:10
<transcript>: Static.

02:48:11
shiftlessatol: it's not working

02:48:13
<transcript>: Right. Svg.

02:48:17
<transcript>: It's not working.

02:48:17
<transcript>: it's not

02:48:21
<transcript>: It's not one, two, three. No, we regenerate the file. So the file should now be.

02:48:24
<transcript>: Like it was.

02:48:26
<transcript>: Deaf.

02:48:29
<transcript>: Yeah, it's this.

02:48:29
<transcript>: fill

02:48:30
<transcript>: Fill.

02:48:30
<transcript>: url

02:48:31
<transcript>: Url.

02:48:34
<transcript>: Like, what.

02:48:37
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm not understanding.

02:48:44
<transcript>: Not understanding.

02:48:51
<transcript>: Why would the Why would we using VAR there.

02:48:55
<transcript>: It's not a variable like there's no variable here. Why would I use variable.

02:48:58
<transcript>: I should question what I'm typing.

02:49:02
<transcript>: So that almost makes sense to me.

02:49:02
<transcript>: fill

02:49:03
<transcript>: Fill.

02:49:03
<transcript>: next

02:49:10
<transcript>: Next X. Right. That almost makes sense. And that actually even seems to be linking to something. I don't know why.

02:49:12
shiftlessatol: here is the example

02:49:14
shiftlessatol: style="fill: var(--primary-color, #1E8F90)"

02:49:14
<transcript>: Now, next stack, bright. Is she.

02:49:14
<transcript>: it's not working

02:49:16
<transcript>: It's not working.

02:49:28
<transcript>: Style. Phil VAR. Primary color. What are you talking about? Dave? What are you talking about? I mean, I could fill it with an arbitrary color. Yes.

02:49:28
<transcript>: i think

02:49:32
<transcript>: I think for the follow F, one AB and osmoses.

02:49:32
<transcript>: i

02:49:36
<transcript>: I could in fact, fill it with an arbitrary color. Dave, how does that help me.

02:49:36
<transcript>: that's

02:49:41
<transcript>: That's that doesn't help me, though, right? I'm trying to fill it with the actual color.

02:49:44
<transcript>: That comes from the SCG.

02:49:48
<transcript>: And it's a bug in Chrome, and I need to figure it out.

02:49:52
shiftlessatol: do  fill: var(--gradient,gradient)

02:49:53
<transcript>: But I'm not gonna I can't keep chasing these red herrings. I just have a little bit of time left.

02:49:55
<transcript>: I don't know.

02:49:55
<transcript>: var

02:49:59
<transcript>: Var gradient gradient. What are you talking about? What is the gradient.

02:50:01
sondreal: adamdo8DealWithIt

02:50:07
<transcript>: What? There's no variable name. Gradient. What are you talking about? Sandriel? What's going on? Sandra.

02:50:07
<transcript>: okay i'm

02:50:08
shiftlessatol: var ( the property, the value )

02:50:11
<transcript>: Okay. I'm done with this. I'm done. I'm done chasing this stuff down.

02:50:11
<transcript>: var the

02:50:14
shiftlessatol: the ide

02:50:16
<transcript>: Var the property of the value. Yeah, I know how far works. I'm just saying, like, no. Okay.

02:50:21
<transcript>: We're gonna figure this out, but it's not chasing this.

02:50:21
<transcript>: style stuff

02:50:22
<transcript>: Style stuff.

02:50:22
<transcript>: visibility

02:50:24
<transcript>: Visibility. Hidden.

02:50:31
<transcript>: Point out in the comments. Place the linear gradient outside the symbol.

02:50:40
<transcript>: So ours are actually outside of the symbol. That's not an issue for us. We're not putting them inside.

02:50:43
j_c___: hryPuff

02:50:48
allcliffs: @adamdotdev can you share the svg, ill try to play around :)

02:50:49
<transcript>: Like the desks are not inside. But maybe they were. That would help. Maybe we need to put the deaf. Let's try that actually.

02:50:49
<transcript>: that's an interesting

02:50:50
<transcript>: That's an interesting.

02:50:50
<transcript>: how do i

02:50:51
shiftlessatol: fill: var(--fill,url(ID))?

02:50:52
<transcript>: How do I undo all this.

02:50:58
<transcript>: So let's try, let's try that let's try.

02:50:58
<transcript>: let's

02:51:00
<transcript>: Let's take it.

02:51:00
<transcript>: and let's

02:51:03
<transcript>: And let's nest the def.

02:51:03
<transcript>: open

02:51:05
<transcript>: Open here.

02:51:06
<transcript>: Let's go.

02:51:06
<transcript>: symbol

02:51:08
<transcript>: Symbol.

02:51:08
<transcript>: we're gonna have

02:51:12
<transcript>: We're gonna have death inside our symbol. Is that how they have it.

02:51:12
<transcript>: it's

02:51:19
<transcript>: It's funny. We're doing literally the thing they said doesn't work. We're gonna try it because we're doing the other way and it doesn't work.

02:51:19
<transcript>: so

02:51:23
<transcript>: So the G, so D and then put the linear gradient inside. There.

02:51:26
<transcript>: Linear gradient.

02:51:34
<transcript>: So we're gonna cut that one and we're gonna put it inside.

02:51:37
<transcript>: This symbol tag. So we already have a defs right here.

02:51:37
<transcript>: drop it

02:51:39
<transcript>: Drop it right there.

02:51:42
<transcript>: Okay.

02:51:45
<transcript>: Maybe that'll work.

02:51:45
<transcript>: let

02:51:46
<transcript>: Let's try it.

02:51:52
<transcript>: If I refresh the page, is it gonna regenerate? I don't think so.

02:51:57
<transcript>: Did it regenerate the thing.

02:51:59
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:52:06
<transcript>: And now it's Regenerate. Still didn't work, though.

02:52:08
<transcript>: Okay.

02:52:11
<transcript>: Let's see can you share the SUG I'll try to play around.

02:52:11
<transcript>: yeah

02:52:14
<transcript>: Yeah. How do I want to do that.

02:52:18
<transcript>: How do I want to share the SEC? I'll create a gist.

02:52:27
<transcript>: File.

02:52:34
<transcript>: Nope. That's all I want? So I can just upload. Let's just.

02:52:34
<transcript>: slide it open

02:52:35
<transcript>: Slide it open.

02:52:35
<transcript>: no

02:52:36
<transcript>: No.

02:52:38
<transcript>: Open with.

02:52:43
<transcript>: Okay. Here it is.

02:52:46
<transcript>: Here it is.

02:52:52
<transcript>: Gonna make it public? I don't know.

02:52:57
<transcript>: I guess if it's private can I share it? Okay. Here it is.

02:52:57
<transcript>: here is

02:52:59
adamdotdev: https://gist.github.com/adamelmore/3019cab4e63126572f27597b52100647

02:52:59
<transcript>: Here is the SVG.

02:53:02
<transcript>: For the curious.

02:53:02
<transcript>: and

02:53:04
<transcript>: And not for the fainted heart.

02:53:10
<transcript>: Saint of heart.

02:53:18
allcliffs: thanks

02:53:26
<transcript>: I've just got five more minutes here.

02:53:31
<transcript>: What a frustrating stream, what a frustrating stream.

02:53:33
<transcript>: I.

02:53:39
<transcript>: I don't know what to try next. I feel like I've tried it. I've tried the things.

02:53:40
grasp5533: Adam do you have any opinions on Twitter talking about Tech Debt?

02:53:43
<transcript>: Kill text, mate, and see if I can.

02:53:43
<transcript>: rec

02:53:45
<transcript>: Recreate. The SVG.

02:53:52
<transcript>: I wonder if I could craft.

02:53:52
<transcript>: well i

02:53:58
allcliffs: thats SVG's for you xD

02:54:02
<transcript>: Well, I guess I can try it right now. I wonder if I could craft like a handmade Sprite that would work, but I think the issue is the linear gate gradient references.

02:54:02
<transcript>: thanks for

02:54:05
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow Pixel Dev.

02:54:09
<transcript>: Do you have any opinions on Twitter talking about Tech debt.

02:54:12
<transcript>: Twitter's talking about tech debt.

02:54:12
<transcript>: is that you saying

02:54:14
<transcript>: Is that you saying like people are.

02:54:23
<transcript>: You mean the employees who was like, if we didn't have so much tech debt, then things would be fast. That whole conversation on Twitter with Elon.

02:54:33
<transcript>: So talking about planes bright true should we try plain Sprite? Let's try plain strike why not? Let's try planespray.

02:54:40
<transcript>: X config just got a few more minutes here. I'm gonna try some things.

02:54:44
<transcript>: Plain.

02:54:47
<transcript>: Plain Sprite truth.

02:54:50
grasp5533: Yeah, and other people are arguing whether tech debt is because of business decisions or engineering decisions

02:54:52
<transcript>: Okay.

02:55:07
shiftlessatol: intafix!

02:55:09
<transcript>: Yeah and arguing. Other people are arguing whether tech debt.

02:55:12
shiftlessatol: instafix*!

02:55:15
<transcript>: Is because of business decisions or engineering decisions.

02:55:25
<transcript>: I don't have a lot of opinions. I I'm not worked on a lot of teams for one thing, so I don't.

02:55:30
<transcript>: I don't have a lot of experience with organizational philosophies. Things like that.

02:55:34
shiftlessatol: *snaps fingers*

02:55:37
<transcript>: It's an interesting thought, though. Like.

02:55:48
dinksrl: oh damn that spacebar

02:55:51
<transcript>: I've heard. I've definitely heard engineers say, like, oh, we wouldn't have someone check that if you'd slow down and let us, like, fix all the stuff. And there's probably something to that. But there's also probably engineers who don't create a lot of tech debt just by nature. I don't know.

02:55:57
<transcript>: That's spacebar. What about my super? The sound of it.

02:55:57
<transcript>: dink

02:55:59
<transcript>: Dink, welcome to Chat dink.

02:56:03
<transcript>: What am I doing right now? I'm trying to.

02:56:03
<transcript>: i'm just

02:56:07
<transcript>: I'm just trying to figure out why.

02:56:07
<transcript>: why

02:56:07
dinksrl: sounds hot

02:56:13
<transcript>: Why? Just why? Why does everything not work? I guess we're trying to do something kind of complicated.

02:56:16
<transcript>: Let's look at the file.

02:56:16
<transcript>: why not

02:56:18
<transcript>: Why not.

02:56:25
<transcript>: What did plain Sprite get us? What did it do differently.

02:56:32
<transcript>: Or did it.

02:56:32
<transcript>: sounds

02:56:36
<transcript>: Sounds hot. Yeah, it's a. It's a nice keyboard. My mode, sonnet.

02:56:36
<transcript>: where is sex

02:56:38
<transcript>: Where is sex mate.

02:56:40
<transcript>: Where is it.

02:56:44
<transcript>: Opened TextMate.

02:56:44
<transcript>: did open

02:56:47
<transcript>: Did open on a different screen.

02:57:03
<transcript>: Checks out today. That checks out. Like, why would I be able to open it? Why would I be able to I can't have nice things.

02:57:03
<transcript>: let's open

02:57:05
<transcript>: Let's open it in something else.

02:57:06
allcliffs: @Grasp5533 I think overall its complex because imagine everyone has their own agenda on how to progress features and their careers. Overall with few exceptions all software will have tech debt over time.

02:57:11
<transcript>: We'll just open it here.

02:57:16
<transcript>: It is.

02:57:20
<transcript>: What did Planespright do is the question.

02:57:25
<transcript>: Symbol def.

02:57:30
<transcript>: Okay, linear gradient. There's still gradients.

02:57:33
<transcript>: Did it not.

02:57:33
<transcript>: apply

02:57:37
<transcript>: Apply the gradient so symbol there should be a path here.

02:57:45
<transcript>: Oh yeah. I don't see the path with the the background gradient. So didn't I don't know.

02:57:47
<transcript>: I don't know.

02:57:59
<transcript>: There it is. Yeah, it still got it in there. I don't know what plane was supposed to do, but I don't see the difference.

02:58:01
<transcript>: I don't see the difference.

02:58:05
grasp5533: Yeah, I always kind of viewed it as engineering teams allowing themselves to be pressured to make the tech debt decisions. I think it falls on engineering to weight business needs against internal needs

02:58:08
<transcript>: Okay, so planes, right? Didn't do the trick.

02:58:13
<transcript>: What are the other options I can do.

02:58:16
grasp5533: weigh*

02:58:22
<transcript>: I don't think anything's gonna matter because ultimately, there's this. We've got this bug. We've got a bug in Chrome.

02:58:37
<transcript>: I think overall it's complex because imagine everyone has their own agenda on how to progress features and their careers. Overall, with few exceptions, all software will have tech bit over time. I agree with that.

02:58:39
<transcript>: I agree with that.

02:58:41
<transcript>: Man.

02:58:44
<transcript>: I'd love to have some kind of resolution.

02:58:44
<transcript>: to

02:58:48
<transcript>: To this problem before I step away for the day.

02:58:48
j_c___: is it worth the time you're spending to fix this chrome bug

02:58:49
dinksrl: what even is the issue rn I joined late

02:58:50
<transcript>: But I don't think I'm gonna have it.

02:58:53
<transcript>: I think we've got an issue with Chrome.

02:58:55
<transcript>: It's a bummer.

02:58:55
<transcript>: is there

02:58:58
<transcript>: Is there some way that I could create the background colors.

02:58:59
shiftlessatol: can you upload the rest

02:59:04
<transcript>: Is there some way I could do it.

02:59:04
<transcript>: you know what

02:59:06
<transcript>: You know what.

02:59:09
<transcript>: There is.

02:59:11
shiftlessatol: of the files that are generated in that same directory as the svg?

02:59:16
<transcript>: Every service belongs to a family. The family is what determines the background gradient.

02:59:20
<transcript>: I could probably manufacture the background.

02:59:28
<transcript>: It's I don't love it I don't love it but I can probably let's just go in here.

02:59:39
<transcript>: I should have thought about just thought outside the box a little bit before this. So Amazon API gateway. I don't know the family's that they belong to, though right now.

02:59:41
<transcript>: Is part of the problem.

02:59:41
<transcript>: i could determine

02:59:47
<transcript>: I could determine it from the background color. Okay. So I could put in this map. I could put in this map.

02:59:47
<transcript>: the actual

02:59:52
<transcript>: The actual background color, and I could render it separately from the SUG. That's what I'm gonna do.

02:59:52
<transcript>: it's dumb

02:59:58
<transcript>: It's dumb. I shouldn't have to do that. But that's what I'm gonna do. And I'm not gonna do it right now. Because.

02:59:58
<transcript>: i got

03:00:00
<transcript>: I got a run.

03:00:05
<transcript>: Does that makes sense.

03:00:11
<transcript>: Does that make sense? I think I can just have the background colors, the gradients.

03:00:11
<transcript>: stored

03:00:27
<transcript>: Stored or just the family. I can determine the family of the service based on the color in the SVG and then render the background for the color of the service as I Div with a background color behind the SVG, it's dumb again. Shouldn't have to do that.

03:00:27
<transcript>: but

03:00:36
allcliffs: submit a bug fix for chrome LUL

03:00:37
<transcript>: But I think it'll work. It'll get a round this stupidestvg bug and it allows me to cache the SVG Sprite as a separate asset.

03:00:37
<transcript>: i think

03:00:38
<transcript>: I think it all works.

03:00:42
<transcript>: Submit a bug fix for Chrome. Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

03:00:49
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow Mayback it's been normally in the stream and I say it's been fun.

03:00:53
<transcript>: Maybe we could do it again. Something I don't think today I can say that today it's been.

03:00:53
<transcript>: painful

03:00:56
<transcript>: Painful. It's been a challenge.

03:00:59
<transcript>: But do you have days like this.

03:00:59
<transcript>: this is just part

03:01:03
<transcript>: This is just part of it. Every day is not the best day and.

03:01:03
<transcript>: need to accept

03:01:05
<transcript>: Need to accept that.

03:01:05
<transcript>: but

03:01:12
<transcript>: But it's been nice to have you all here and to interact with you. All that part was fun. Maybe we could do a game sometimes.

03:01:24
dinksrl: It's been sad and Chrome has used you

03:01:35
