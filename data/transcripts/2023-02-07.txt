11:35:33
<transcript>: You.

11:50:50
<transcript>: I got these glasses.

11:50:50
<transcript>: i thought

11:50:51
<transcript>: I thought.

11:50:55
<transcript>: With Snap camera was just continued.

11:50:55
<transcript>: so i got

11:50:58
<transcript>: So I got some real Ray bands thinking.

11:51:04
<transcript>: What's go wrong? Well, let's see. Could go wrong is they look nothing like the digital ones.

11:51:08
<transcript>: They're hardly green. It turns out real life.

11:51:08
<transcript>: not so

11:51:10
<transcript>: Not so colorful.

11:51:18
<transcript>: Now it just looks like an asshole. Assignment. Sunglasses on.

11:51:24
<transcript>: I guess they're probably always looking like an asshole with sunglasses.

11:51:54
<transcript>: You.

11:52:20
<transcript>: Check, check, check, check. Itch.

11:54:12
<transcript>: The Stack camera was discontinued.

11:54:24
<transcript>: And I had this idea that I would get real glasses. So I got some real Ray bands. They've got light green lenses. And they look nothing like the digital ones.

11:54:26
<transcript>: I'm a little pissed.

11:54:26
<transcript>: so now

11:54:30
<transcript>: So now I just look like an asshole with sunglasses on in my office.

11:54:34
<transcript>: I guess I probably always look like an asshole with sunglasses out of my office.

11:55:03
<transcript>: Half camera was just continued. Sam camera was like arfects that I would put on my face while I streamed because I'm a degenerate.

11:55:03
<transcript>: once

11:55:08
<transcript>: Once they discontinued it, I ordered these real Ray bands with light green lenses, thinking.

11:55:11
<transcript>: It'll be like I never lost it.

11:55:12
<transcript>: turns out

11:55:15
<transcript>: Turns out they look nothing like the digital ones.

11:55:18
<transcript>: So now it just looks like an asshole with sunglasses on.

11:55:23
<transcript>: I guess I always looked like an asshole with sunglasses, sunglasses on.

11:55:41
<transcript>: My.

11:55:43
<transcript>: Side.

11:55:57
<transcript>: So as soon as Snap disconnected the Snap camera, which was the AR glasses that I would wear.

11:55:57
<transcript>: i ordered

11:55:59
<transcript>: I ordered these real range.

11:55:59
<transcript>: with light

11:56:02
<transcript>: With light green glasses. Light green lenses.

11:56:02
<transcript>: i thought

11:56:09
<transcript>: I thought it'd be like I never lost a Snap camera effects, but it looks nothing like the digital ones.

11:56:13
<transcript>: So now I just look like an asshole with sunglasses on.

11:56:17
<transcript>: I guess I always probably look like an asshole with sunglasses.

11:56:35
<transcript>: App Camera is discontinued.

11:56:35
<transcript>: snap

11:56:36
<transcript>: like snap

11:56:36
<transcript>: Snap.

11:56:43
<transcript>: Like snapchat had made this desktop app where you could run these AR filters, put them on your face, run through a camera.

11:56:51
<transcript>: That's how I did all the things I do on twitch, with the glasses and all that stuff. It's all super dumb in retrospect.

11:56:51
<transcript>: and gimmick

11:57:02
<transcript>: And gimmicky. But I order these real Ray bands with like, green lenses and everything thinking they'd look just like the digital ones. They look nothing like them.

11:57:06
<transcript>: So now I'm just going to asshole with sunglasses on.

11:57:06
<transcript>: i guess

11:57:10
<transcript>: I guess I always look like an asshole with sunglasses on.

12:27:15
<transcript>: So spam.

12:27:15
<transcript>: oh

12:27:19
<transcript>: Oh, man, it feels so good. This was not how I planned on returning.

12:27:19
<transcript>: we just

12:27:24
<transcript>: We just have some. I have some things I need to do today, and I need to do them on stream. Step rows. Here.

12:27:29
<transcript>: I need to I need to give away a MacBook.

12:27:33
<transcript>: This macbook. Actually, I'm starting to feel like.

12:27:36
<transcript>: Starting to feel like I'm kind of cringe on the internet.

12:27:36
<transcript>: at what point

12:27:42
fragaverage: i'll take it, thanks

12:27:45
dennis_traub: Hey 👋

12:27:46
fragaverage: job done

12:27:55
realjesusos: DID YOU GET INVESTORS ON LINKED IN

12:27:55
<transcript>: At what point? At what point are you validate? That, like, do I need to? I need to run a poll. What a poll? Even tell me people would be too nice, wouldn't they? I'm starting to feel like the things I do on the Internet, they're not what I want them to be like, I want here's what I want to do. I want to give people specifically, like, younger developers.

12:27:55
<transcript>: and specifically

12:27:58
<transcript>: And specifically developers in like.

12:28:02
rosidae0: i wonder if anybody remembers me, or the name lon_Iol

12:28:04
<transcript>: Not great circumstances. So I grew up in the ozone, still living the ozarks and.

12:28:04
<transcript>: not a lot of

12:28:08
tayloreddev: that will come in handy, my 2013 macbook is showing its age now LUL

12:28:11
<transcript>: Not a lot of opportunity, like economically in the area, relatively like it's the US. So it's still like we're doing fine.

12:28:11
<transcript>: but

12:28:20
iannery: morning adam!

12:28:27
<transcript>: But relative to like the cities on the coasts, you know, it's not like you have a lot of opportunities in terms of job opportunities. So the internet in software development really kind of saved me from a lot of economic hardship that is seen in this area.

12:28:27
<transcript>: and

12:28:35
<transcript>: And I want to do I want to do things to help people in similar situations. I'm very passionate about that specific thing.

12:28:48
<transcript>: And one thing I want to do is like, help people who are early in their career with equipment, just giving them things that could help them along their way. It's really hard to find people that, you know, like, legitimately having a need.

12:28:49
<transcript>: Anybody.

12:28:49
<transcript>: even have answers

12:28:56
<transcript>: Even have answers to that. Like if I wanted to find specifically people who would take a laptop and run with it and it would really help them.

12:28:56
<transcript>: in their software

12:28:58
<transcript>: In their software development journey.

12:28:58
<transcript>: how you do that

12:29:06
<transcript>: How you do that? I've been trying for weeks to find ways to find those people. I thought, like, open source contributors. That.

12:29:06
<transcript>: like

12:29:13
andom: Yooo HeyGuys

12:29:18
theruggedbear: facebook groups probably

12:29:27
<transcript>: Like, they're just using some really old laptop. I heard that like, one of the pmpm developers had a really old laptop. But then I reached out to them. You no longer has a really old laptop anyway, trying to find like, I don't want to give it to people who are just gonna sell it. You know what I'm saying? Like, I want developers who really need maybe I need to find people that can vouch that this person really needs.

12:29:28
<transcript>: Something anyway.

12:29:29
realjesusos: most people in 3rd world countries probably meet that criteria

12:29:41
<transcript>: I'm just starting to feel like, so I'm giving a way this macbook, I was gonna return, like, in a few weeks, I was planning, like, a big it's actually still gonna happen, but it's a little more extra, a little more grandiose.

12:29:41
<transcript>: than just

12:29:48
<transcript>: Than just coming back to give away a macbook. But I wanted to do this on stream because I felt like I don't know people who.

12:29:49
iannery: look for react native devs in brazil. A mac here is the same price as a new car

12:29:53
<transcript>: Submitted to try and win this macbook. I'm like giving it away.

12:29:53
<transcript>: oh you anyone

12:29:54
<transcript>: Oh, you? Anyone watching? Can you.

12:29:54
<transcript>: put in

12:29:59
<transcript>: Put in the name and the hat saying, I'll explain how I'm doing it.

12:29:59
<transcript>: i just thought

12:29:59
realjesusos: or at least have a high probability to do meet them

12:30:02
<transcript>: I just thought, like showing how I'm gonna.

12:30:02
<transcript>: transparently

12:30:03
<transcript>: Transparently.

12:30:03
<transcript>: so people don't think it's

12:30:14
<transcript>: So people don't think it's rigged. Like we're gonna literally write the code to find the people on github that started this repo and give away. Okay, I'm start reading chat. I forgotten how to read chat. People completely forgotten.

12:30:21
<transcript>: Step ro. I'm not your favorite shamer, but I appreciate sentiment. That's very kind.

12:30:23
stiefbroerikzitvast: notice us

12:30:28
<transcript>: Dennis, Dennis, I've never seen you in Chat. Welcome to Chat. I know Dennis, from the aws community.

12:30:33
cennedy__: hi!!

12:30:34
<transcript>: Did you get investors on LinkedIn? Welcome to Chat. Real. Jesus.

12:30:34
<transcript>: not

12:30:38
<transcript>: Not yet. I have gotten some positive response.

12:30:39
stiefbroerikzitvast: since star_ansible left twitch, you ARE my favorite streamer

12:30:41
<transcript>: This is where I start to feel like I'm kind of cringe on the internet.

12:30:47
realjesusos: Kappa

12:30:56
<transcript>: This whole giveaway thing. I just I was trying to figure out, how can I give away the MacBook. And I thought, like, github started dumb, and I'd love to prove it. So I'm gonna make a YouTube video that's, like, how to get a thousand get upstars or whatever. And then, like, the last step is giveaway a MacBook.

12:30:57
estrangedhd: @StiefbroerIkZitVast oof KEKW

12:31:01
<transcript>: Yeah. So I'm starting to feel like this whole thing is kind of overblown.

12:31:01
<transcript>: and

12:31:04
daneoshiga: hey Adam! nice to see you back

12:31:05
memph1s: give me ty

12:31:08
<transcript>: And I put it on LinkedIn, like with a serious tone because I never post anything on LinkedIn.

12:31:08
<transcript>: said i was looking

12:31:10
<transcript>: Said I was looking for investors.

12:31:15
<transcript>: Wonder if anybody remembers me or the name Lot. Of course.

12:31:15
<transcript>: i didn't

12:31:20
<transcript>: I didn't know you changed your name to rosie roseado.

12:31:24
<transcript>: Long. But I do remember Lawn. Of course I remember you.

12:31:32
<transcript>: That will come in handy. My judge, and 13 macbook is showing his agent. Okay, so, Taylor, now I feel like I do know someone who has a need, and it's Taylor.

12:31:32
<transcript>: a two thousand

12:31:36
<transcript>: A 2013 macbook that's old now that's ten years.

12:31:36
<transcript>: good morning

12:31:38
am29d: :wave:

12:31:41
<transcript>: Good morning, lady. Lanari. I think I need to make my this needs to be bigger.

12:31:44
<transcript>: Okay. I'm getting older.

12:31:44
<transcript>: and

12:31:51
<transcript>: And I'm gonna see you the rugged Bear Facebook groups. Probably. Oh, that's where I could find people with need. Okay.

12:31:51
<transcript>: noted

12:32:01
<transcript>: Noted, I don't get on Facebook anymore, but I could try that what Facebook groups, specifically, most people in Third World countries probably meet that criteria. Yeah, I feel like that's true.

12:32:01
<transcript>: i also think

12:32:05
<transcript>: I also think there's probably a lot of people in really.

12:32:05
<transcript>: economic

12:32:07
<transcript>: Economic Depressed areas.

12:32:07
<transcript>: impoverished areas

12:32:13
<transcript>: Impoverished areas that if given a laptop, they probably just sell it. And maybe that's maybe that's fine. I don't know.

12:32:19
cennedy__: facebook idk who uses facebook

12:32:26
<transcript>: But I'd prefer knowing like it was helping somebody in this specific getting into this career or just on their journey, like they don't have the equipment to just do the job. You know, I'm saying.

12:32:33
<transcript>: Look for React native devs in Brazil a Mac here is the same price as a new car. Oh, Geez.

12:32:33
<transcript>: at least

12:32:36
<transcript>: At least have high probability to do to meet them.

12:32:37
dennis_traub: You gonna show us your new sunglasses? 😎

12:32:39
denvermullets: ooo haven't seen an Adam stream in a hot minute

12:32:43
<transcript>: Connecty senetti. Sinai. Kennedy. Welcome to chat.

12:32:43
<transcript>: hi

12:32:44
<transcript>: Hi.

12:32:50
<transcript>: Since Star ansible Left Twitch You are my favorite. Starrings Will Left Twitch.

12:32:57
<transcript>: This is a lot of bittersweet news that Star Ends will left Twitch that Nick is no longer on Twitch.

12:32:59
estrangedhd: yea, hireproof flopped

12:33:02
<transcript>: But also kind of sweet that I'm your favorite streamer now that's very kind.

12:33:09
<transcript>: Of my first friends on Twitch.

12:33:16
am29d: were are the sunglasses?

12:33:21
<transcript>: Because back when I didn't know any what I was doing on twitch. Still don't know what I'm doing, but really didn't know what I was doing. The first few streams Nick rated me, and it was like.

12:33:21
<transcript>: what is a raid

12:33:23
<transcript>: What is a raid? What is happening.

12:33:25
stiefbroerikzitvast: @EstrangedHD i've been warning him about that for years

12:33:27
<transcript>: The neo. Nice to see you back.

12:33:32
<transcript>: Am. Welcome to Chat. Wave, Hello.

12:33:32
<transcript>: facebook

12:33:35
<transcript>: Facebook. I don't know who uses Facebook. My parents use Facebook.

12:33:35
<transcript>: and all

12:33:37
<transcript>: And all their friends.

12:33:41
<transcript>: New sunglasses. You got it, Dennis.

12:33:44
<transcript>: They are.

12:33:56
<transcript>: Way dumber looking than I thought they would be in my mind before they arrived, like from the pictures on the product page. In my mind, they look just like the glasses that I that I fake put on my face. You know, the.

12:34:02
<transcript>: Ar thing. They look just like them light green lenses. The whole thing.

12:34:02
<transcript>: in

12:34:09
<transcript>: In reality, they look really dumb. They just look like they black out my eyes. Like, where are my eyes.

12:34:09
<transcript>: i look like

12:34:10
dennis_traub: Woohoo, nice

12:34:12
<transcript>: I look like I mean the FBI or something.

12:34:17
<transcript>: So, yeah, I'm just gonna wear them to the pool this summer. That was an experience.

12:34:17
<transcript>: gone wrong

12:34:18
<transcript>: Gone wrong.

12:34:18
<transcript>: oh

12:34:23
<transcript>: Oh, no. Are the I thought I turned off all the rewards because they're not gonna work.

12:34:25
fragaverage: oi!

12:34:26
<transcript>: They're still enabled.

12:34:26
fragaverage: SCAM

12:34:31
<transcript>: Oh, maybe. No, frag can just do it. Cuz. He's a mod. Is that what happened.

12:34:31
<transcript>: damn

12:34:35
<transcript>: Damn well, I mean, you redeemed it frags. So here we go.

12:34:35
<transcript>: let's

12:34:46
<transcript>: Let's see if I can read with them on. Haven't seen an atom stream in a high minute, Denver. It's because I haven't streamed in a hot minute. More than a hot minute, like two months. It's been a couple months.

12:34:46
<transcript>: i took a holiday

12:34:47
<transcript>: I took a holiday break.

12:34:48
iannery: fancy sunglasses

12:34:54
<transcript>: And I was gonna stretch it to valentine's Day because that's a that's a holiday.

12:34:58
<transcript>: Hire proof flopped. What is higher proof.

12:35:02
cennedy__: for me you dont have to give m2 mac like 2nd hand laptop will be fine for me but idk it sounded like words from a beggar

12:35:03
<transcript>: I've been warning him about that for years.

12:35:06
<transcript>: What's higher proof.

12:35:18
<transcript>: For me, you don't have to give into Mac like secondhand laptop will be fine for me, but I'm not sound like words from a beggar. No, I get that synity. I think.

12:35:18
<transcript>: actually

12:35:23
stiefbroerikzitvast: you dont know Hireproof? Star_ansible can give a product tour. (it was his startup)

12:35:23
theruggedbear: hireproof was star_ansible app :(

12:35:26
<transcript>: Actually, I reached out in some discord channels, just asking, like people that I know who were really plugged into open source.

12:35:27
estrangedhd: hireproof is the thing star worked on

12:35:31
<transcript>: Oh, hire proof of star handles that I knew it was about hiring. Thank you. Gotcha.

12:35:31
<transcript>: all startup

12:35:46
<transcript>: All startups are escaping or not a scam. All startups are what's the word you guys use flopped. All startups are gonna flop eventually. What are the average age of a couple companies? Like, what, five years or something? So it's really just like, Enjoy the ride.

12:35:48
<transcript>: Anyway.

12:35:48
<transcript>: except

12:35:59
<transcript>: Except for stannis. We're doing great and very excited about the future. Mostly. I'm gonna be streaming building, statmes, by the way, I'm all over the place. I'm all over the places. Okay.

12:36:01
fragaverage: Hot take, "All startups are a scam" - Adam Elmore's first 2023 stream

12:36:10
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, the second the second handmac. So I reached out some people in a discord server where there's lots of, like, open source people that are plugged in. And I said.

12:36:16
tayloreddev: (except statmuse) LUL

12:36:24
<transcript>: Anybody know of people who need laptops in the open source community. And that got people excited, like, oh, we could start, like, an initiative and, like, get people to donate their old macbooks. And we could give to people and, like, wow, this all sounds great.

12:36:24
<transcript>: that's not what

12:36:27
<transcript>: That's not what I was thinking. I was thinking.

12:36:27
<transcript>: like i was

12:36:30
<transcript>: Like I was gonna give away some new MacBooks to people.

12:36:30
<transcript>: mr

12:36:32
<transcript>: Mr. Beastyle.

12:36:32
<transcript>: but

12:36:38
<transcript>: But an organization that, like, gets a bunch of donated old laptops and gives them out to people who need just an upgrade.

12:36:38
<transcript>: seems

12:36:41
<transcript>: Seems like a good organization. Someone should create that.

12:36:44
<transcript>: Okay.

12:36:47
cennedy__: WAIT ACTUALLY WAIT it would be better if you give me a job that I can do at the price of a 2nd hand laptop I can improve myself and buy a laptop im such a smart guy

12:36:50
<transcript>: Hot take AI all startups or scam why it's really hard to read with these glasses.

12:36:56
<transcript>: That's the good thing about the AR glasses. They don't actually affect my vision.

12:37:05
iannery: I gotta agree with that take, I'm trying to work in a startup and the more we grow the more I see the bottleneck

12:37:07
<transcript>: Weight actually, wait. It would be better if you give me a job that I can do at the price of a secondhand laptop. I can improve myself in my laptop. I'm such a smart guy. So that's actually a good point.

12:37:07
<transcript>: what's better

12:37:10
<transcript>: What's better than giving someone a laptop, giving them a job.

12:37:21
<transcript>: Because then they can buy their own laptop, sort of teaching a man to fish kind of thing. I gotta agree with that take. I'm trying to work in a startup, and the more we grow, the more I see the bottleneck.

12:37:21

12:38:58
ohmymndy: Haha, that's where I've been indeed ;-)

12:39:04
ohmymndy: Hi @FragAverage

12:39:05
<transcript>: So I'm giving away a new MacBook. It's an in to MacBook pro. I'm actually giving away a few of them, but the first one I'm gonna give away.

12:39:05
<transcript>: i

12:39:09
<transcript>: I decided to kind of troll GitHub.

12:39:09
<transcript>: stars

12:39:10
<transcript>: Stars.

12:39:10
<transcript>: let's see

12:39:14
<transcript>: Let's see. How can I. How can I share this with you guys? Well, first of all, topic.

12:39:14
<transcript>: topic

12:39:17
<transcript>: Topic giving away.

12:39:17
<transcript>: a

12:39:19
<transcript>: A Mac.

12:39:23
adamdotdev: !topic giving away a new m2 macbook pro

12:39:25
<transcript>: A new Max Book Pro that just sounds way better.

12:39:28
<transcript>: Did it update? It still works.

12:39:37
<transcript>: The topic thing still works. Who knows what's not gonna work after two months, software just kind of starts resting.

12:39:37
<transcript>: except for stuff

12:39:39
<transcript>: Except for stuff written in rest.

12:39:39
<transcript>: why it's called that

12:39:41
<transcript>: Why it's called that right.

12:39:46
<transcript>: So here's the giveaway so if you retweet.

12:39:48
<transcript>: This tweet that I put on Twitter, which.

12:39:48
<transcript>: was my

12:39:53
<transcript>: Was my only distribution channel, so you need to retweet it so other people see it.

12:39:56
cennedy__: oh btw did you see earthquake in turkey

12:40:02
<transcript>: Retweet gets you an entry and starring a github repo get you another entry so you can get up to two entries into this giveaway here.

12:40:17
<transcript>: And and I'm gonna do it on string. Here. We're gonna, like, use the apis to fetch all the github stars and fetch all the YouTube or the Twitter retweets. And everybody gets an entry we're gonna throw in a big array. Randomly select one.

12:40:17
<transcript>: and then

12:40:23
<transcript>: And then, yeah. So necessarily be one of you. But all of you are free to enter.

12:40:26
<transcript>: In those two ways that are possible.

12:40:26
<transcript>: finite

12:40:29
<transcript>: Finite I did see about the earthquake in Turkey.

12:40:29
<transcript>: sounds awful

12:40:30
<transcript>: Sounds awful.

12:40:34
<transcript>: Seven, eight, like.

12:40:34
<transcript>: my wife

12:40:42
<transcript>: My wife and I were talking about this last night. Just the like, if you get an earthquake that big. I saw the.

12:40:42
<transcript>: after shock

12:40:46
<transcript>: After shocks like seven, five, after shock. It's like three or four major earthquakes.

12:40:46
<transcript>: just

12:40:49
<transcript>: Just unbelievable.

12:40:52
<transcript>: Went on a whole.

12:40:52
<transcript>: bunny

12:40:59
<transcript>: Bunny of whatever those clouds. I can never remember the phrase Rabbit trail. Rabbit hole went down the road of like.

12:40:59
<transcript>: studying

12:41:02
<transcript>: Studying earthquakes last night.

12:41:05
<transcript>: Just because of how devastating they can be.

12:41:05
<transcript>: that's

12:41:07
realjesusos: after shocks are still happening will probably keep on happening for a week

12:41:08
cennedy__: i live in turkey so its terrible my mother and family lives in Diyarbakir so really awful anyway

12:41:09
<transcript>: That's another thing. Oh, that's another thing. I had the thought.

12:41:26
<transcript>: Like it seems like every time I had some dumb idea where I'm gonna, like, give away something or do something dumb, and I post about it. And then I learned some tragedy in the world, and I feel really bad. So I already felt kind of cringe for just the way I'm doing this giveaway. I don't know.

12:41:28
<transcript>: But then seeing that.

12:41:33
<transcript>: Yeah. Makes it hard, but that's not like me. There's always something awful happening in the world.

12:41:40
<transcript>: If we didn't do things while there's awful things happening, we'd never do things, but.

12:41:40
<transcript>: i thought maybe

12:41:43
<transcript>: I thought maybe there's some way to make this giveaway.

12:41:43
<transcript>: could i like don

12:41:50
<transcript>: Could I like Donate. Maybe I thought about this. Maybe for every star on the github repo after some period.

12:41:50
<transcript>: i'll donate

12:41:51
<transcript>: I'll donate a dollar.

12:41:51
<transcript>: toward like

12:41:59
<transcript>: Toward, like, relief funds or something just to, like, be sensitive to the fact that this awful thing happened in the world. And I don't want to.

12:42:05
<transcript>: Just feels worse to be like meming and doing dumb things when.

12:42:05
<transcript>: people are

12:42:07
<transcript>: People are suffering.

12:42:19
<transcript>: Okay, after shocks are still happening. Oh, wow. Still happening. Probably keep happening for a week. Geez, yeah. Isn't the scale the way earthquakes work? Every.

12:42:19
<transcript>: point

12:42:22
<transcript>: Point one is like ten times more powerful.

12:42:22
<transcript>: than the last

12:42:24
<transcript>: Than the last.

12:42:24
<transcript>: oh

12:42:32
<transcript>: Oh, finite. You live in turkeys, Turbother and family lives in I don't know how to say that. I really awful. Geez, yeah, it's.

12:42:33
thdxr: did you realize you lost your blue check

12:42:37
<transcript>: 7.8. That's a big one. I don't remember hearing.

12:42:41
<transcript>: I don't remember hearing of on that big in a long time.

12:42:41
<transcript>: dax

12:42:46
<transcript>: Dax is here. Did you realize you lost your blue check? I did. Dax, you know why I'm mad about that.

12:42:46
<transcript>: i'm not

12:43:07
<transcript>: I'm not mad that I lost the blue check. I'm mad that I went to that software, literally. I had to Hunt down. I couldn't remember what the name was like, the name of the Thing Pulse banner. I, like finally found it. Went to the site. It's really hard to figure out how to use the site once you've already paid them and done the thing. But I went in. I wanted to specifically disable that. I don't want it to change my Twitter stuff because I've heard.

12:43:07
<transcript>: all the stories

12:43:09
thdxr: same lol took me so long to remember the name

12:43:12
<transcript>: All the stories of people being live forever. And like, I just didn't want that. So I disabled it all.

12:43:15
<transcript>: Still did it.

12:43:23
<transcript>: So now I'm bummed because it's probably some indie hacker. And I get it like we're all learning. But like this is the problem with indie hacking is like.

12:43:23
<transcript>: you start

12:43:28
<transcript>: You start thinking as things is gonna work when you do something with it and just doesn't work.

12:43:28
<transcript>: because

12:43:31
<transcript>: Because we're all busy, you know.

12:43:36
<transcript>: Just go the startup route.

12:43:36
<transcript>: what's what is

12:43:40
<transcript>: What's? What is the thing with any hacking? I think I have a take this. I'm not sure.

12:43:48
<transcript>: The other one. I always forget. Dax is riverside. I always had to Google, like podcast, recording, guests, software.

12:43:55
<transcript>: Can never remember the name of Bruce. I don't know. I just remembered it. So there's that. Hey, I thought I turned off all those things.

12:43:55
<transcript>: minions

12:43:59
<transcript>: Minions. I'm so sorry. I don't have those working.

12:43:59

12:44:07
<transcript>: I'll get that fixed for the next stream.

12:44:07
<transcript>: one thing i am

12:44:18
<transcript>: One thing I am gonna do is I'm gonna make for this season two. I'm calling this season two. My return to streaming. I'm gonna make a reward. So I'm gonna remove all the AR filters. We don't have those anymore.

12:44:29
<transcript>: Snap Can was discontinued, and I just honestly, it was so complicated. I didn't like that. I was like, I'm pretty nervous about resolution and stuff.

12:44:29
<transcript>: there's a lot of

12:44:42
<transcript>: There's a lot of reasons I didn't love it, so we're kind of getting rid of that, but I'm gonna have one. A reward. That's like a slot machine. Like you have a 1% chance when you redeem this thing of winning something like a MacBook.

12:44:42
<transcript>: i don't know

12:44:44
<transcript>: I don't know, it's dumb.

12:44:44

<transcript>: okay

12:54:41
<transcript>: Okay.

12:54:41

12:54:54
<transcript>: List stargazers.

12:54:58
<transcript>: Oh, get up, cli. That sounds even better.

12:54:58
<transcript>: our

12:55:03
<transcript>: Our JavaScript. We can just do JavaScript octokit that works.

ilkou99: KEKW

12:55:23

12:55:32
<transcript>: Sdk version Three has Ouch AJ out. Good morning, rodney, and welcome to chat.

12:55:47
<transcript>: if stars aren't

12:55:53
<transcript>: If stars aren't a good mixture, welcome to Chat pod of greed. If stars aren't a good metric, what would you use instead.

12:55:53
<transcript>: i think i've

12:55:55
<transcript>: I think I've heard like.

12:55:55
<transcript>: actual usage

12:56:03
<transcript>: Actual usage so downloads there's a better metric than stars. I don't know if you can gain downloads as easily.

12:56:09
<transcript>: I don't know. It's really not the metrics fault. It's abused. Like I'm abusing it. So I guess, like.

12:56:14
<transcript>: Is it that bad? I think the point like it'd be really funny.

12:56:14
<transcript>: i

12:56:16
<transcript>: I know some venture capitalists.

12:56:16
<transcript>: i've raised

12:56:32
<transcript>: I've raised some money in my day. It'd be really funny if somebody on LinkedIn reached out that's the next step of this is if I get like an actual inbound from a vc and I pitch them, I will totally pitch them with a straight face and film it and make it a YouTube video.

12:56:32
<transcript>: if that happens

12:56:37
<transcript>: If that happens, then I think we can all talk. We can have the conversation about how dumb.

12:56:37
<transcript>: tracks

12:56:42
<transcript>: Tracks on github is I guess you need a wider atom. I'm so thin.

realjesusos: @Shintaii84 BANNED

13:03:55

<transcript>: Make.

13:04:05
<transcript>: Dir.

13:04:07
<transcript>: dirty

13:04:10
<transcript>: Dirty I made with statmes.com like three months ago.

13:04:11
cennedy__: we cant see term

13:04:12
shintaii84: all automated (new products, new blog, etc, etc etc)

13:04:13
<transcript>: Mcdir.

13:04:16
<transcript>: Macbook.

13:04:25
<transcript>: You can't see the terminal. This is what I get for widening.

13:04:25
<transcript>: thing

13:04:26
thdxr: it's cut off on the left is that intentional

13:04:28
<transcript>: Thing. I widened it. How's that.

13:04:32
<transcript>: Cut off on the left. Is that intentional? No, it wasn't. If you'll recall.

13:04:32
<transcript>: the the

13:04:35
nexxeln: better

13:04:37
<transcript>: The the panel with me on it was not so big before.

13:04:41
<transcript>: So all my windows are laid out based on on that information.

13:04:44
elicxlive: Out of curiosity, how come it's that repo needs starring for your giveaway? Are you going to build something in it?

13:04:53
<transcript>: I'm actually gonna fix something real quick. Let's do this full screen projector on this monitor. There we go. Now I can actually see what you guys see. And I can drag this over.

13:04:55
<transcript>: Until it's perfect.

13:04:55
<transcript>: right there

13:04:57
<transcript>: Right there.

13:05:02
<transcript>: They get it.

13:05:02
<transcript>: got it

13:05:03
<transcript>: Got it. Okay.

13:05:06
<transcript>: Did I make the dirt.

13:05:06
<transcript>: did i make it

13:05:07
1074cankirispor: what is the purpose of project ?

13:05:07
<transcript>: Did I make it.

13:05:10
<transcript>: What was I gonna call it? Macbook pro.

13:05:10
<transcript>: macbook

13:05:15
realjesusos: still a bit cut off

13:05:15
<transcript>: Macbook macbook Pro cd maxbook pro.

13:05:18
thdxr: to make fun of GitHub stars

13:05:18
fitzsimons_dev: is there a decent "getting started live coding on twitch" blog that anyone has seen?

13:05:19
<transcript>: What is the purpose of the project? Giveaway a MacBook.

13:05:19
<transcript>: a macbook pro

13:05:20
<transcript>: A macbook pro.

13:05:24
<transcript>: So we're gonna give away this macbook pro.

13:05:24
<transcript>: this m

13:05:29
<transcript>: This M two macbook pro gonna give it away on this stream.

13:05:29
<transcript>: right here

13:05:31
<transcript>: Right here.

13:05:51
<transcript>: To make fun of github search. Yeah, that's the actual purpose. I guess so we're gonna make I'm just gonna do this in javascript, not Thai script. If I'm doing it nodes, I just do it. It's just javascript. This is like the one case where I would say just use javascript. You don't need typescript because you're literally going to throw the repo away. I'm telling myself.

13:05:51
<transcript>: that

13:05:52
<transcript>: That.

13:05:56
thdxr: use TS and use bun

13:05:58
<transcript>: How come it's that repo needs starring for your giveaway? Are you going to build something in it now.

13:05:58
<transcript>: it's just

13:06:00
<transcript>: It's just. It's just.

13:06:01
thdxr: that's what I've been doing

13:06:09
thdxr: for little scripts

13:06:13
<transcript>: A way of giving it to developers. That was kind of the reason initially was like if I make a github, it's someone who has a getup account or at least goes to the trouble to make one. So more likely a developer. I'm trying to give the laptop to a device.

13:06:13
<transcript>: ideally

13:06:17
<transcript>: Ideally, a developer who really needs it. Turns out it's really hard to find those people.

13:06:17
<transcript>: a lot of people

13:06:17
nexxeln: @fitzsimons_dev rox has a great video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-G3bpS5zJ6g

13:06:19
1074cankirispor: So you'll code random roller for choose the winner

13:06:23
elicxlive: Ah interesting, that's a cool approach then

13:06:27
<transcript>: A lot of people will tell you they need it. I just don't know. I don't know how to vet it, how to say, like, this is the person who actually could use a laptop. I need, like, a social proof system.

13:06:27
nexxeln: use TS with deno GIGACHAD

13:06:30
fitzsimons_dev: thanks @nexxeln

13:06:31
nexxeln: no gigachad nvm

13:06:37
thdxr: I really need a laptop, been coding on my phone this whole time

13:06:38
<transcript>: Use ts and use bun. Oh, well, I do want to play with bun. I guess it wouldn't do anything differently. It would just be faster. Okay.

13:06:38
<transcript>: macbook pro

13:06:39
<transcript>: Macbook pro.

13:06:39
<transcript>: i'm in a direct

13:06:46
<transcript>: I'm in a directory. Let's just open it. Let's just open this directory that has nothing in it. We're gonna make a file called.

13:06:56
<transcript>: Okay, so we're doing it. Ts with no, not with denm. We're gonna do bun.

13:06:56
<transcript>: t

13:06:58
<transcript>: Ts with bun.

13:06:58
<transcript>: that's

13:07:03
<transcript>: That's right. Since any four will code, we're gonna code a random roller.

13:07:04
shintaii84: @thdxr i'm using a typewriter, and then scan it.

13:07:06
cennedy__: @thdxr LUL

13:07:08
<transcript>: So that means I need to name my file.

13:07:10
<transcript>: Giveaway.

<transcript>: Give.

13:07:12
<transcript>: away

13:07:15

1074cankirispor: @thdxr don't even try man

13:07:23
<transcript>: My team ex the pain title is give away because I can't type that word apparently giveaway dot.

13:07:25
kisancodes: where do i find your dotfiles

13:07:26
stream_kyle: mocomaEyebrow "I do wanna play with bun"

13:07:29
<transcript>: Actually I'm gonna name it run because I'm have to type this run. That ts. Cool.

<transcript>: Someone tell me someone let me know how to do this without just reminding you a slant altogether. It shouldn't. It shouldn't try any of it. There's no eslint config. I want to make it, like explicit. That's the setting. I need to figure that out.

13:10:18
<transcript>: oh

13:10:24

13:16:06
<transcript>: Dano has an lsp.

13:16:13
thdxr: ohh that's nice

13:16:17
<transcript>: Which doesn't give that air to you. And also you get to spend time configuring the lsp. That's not a noc. I enjoy configuring my LSDs and my in them. That's my hobby.

13:16:24
<transcript>: So using CA for TMX prefix. How do you increment in vim.

13:16:26
elicxlive: env files automatically load into process.env and Bun.env

13:16:27
<transcript>: Increment. So like if there's a number.

13:16:27
<transcript>: const

13:16:35
<transcript>: Const number or NUM equals one. And I want to increment that. What do I do? It's been a long time. I guess I don't do anything.

13:16:43
<transcript>: I used to know that one of my first weeks of them and Neil, them. Somebody taught me that. And I guess I just don't do it.

<transcript>: Sock is here. Right.

13:17:05
<transcript>: Socket is here. Sock is back.

13:17:14
<transcript>: In files automatically load into process ends and bun in. Okay, that's cool. So I don't even have to use, like, a package or anything.

13:17:16
<transcript>: Okay.

13:17:20
sockthedev: you are back 😗

13:17:26

13:28:00
<transcript>: number

13:28:03
<transcript>: Number. It's going to be this code.

13:28:06
<transcript>: Oh, I guess async.

13:28:10
<transcript>: It's gonna return.

13:28:10
<transcript>: respons

13:28:13
<transcript>: Response. But we need to do this.

13:28:14
nexxeln: whats your take on return types @adamdotdev

13:28:25
<transcript>: Like no, how does how does the web work page equal.

13:28:29
<transcript>: Page. We did it.

13:28:32
thdxr: he wants to return to work

13:28:32
<transcript>: Did it I guess we could make page.

13:28:36
<transcript>: We could make it optional and then.

13:28:42
<transcript>: Would this work? Could I just do.

13:28:44
devinda_me: ayyyy, been waiting so long for strim @adamdotdev

13:28:47
<transcript>: If I say page zero, we'll give you the first page. Probably right.

13:28:55
thdxr: just watch the last 2 mins of Theo's new video

fitzsimons_dev: true story I used the Twitter return type conversation in a PR comment yesterday

13:28:59
joostschuur: I literally just started using TypeScript a week ago, I'm just glad when there's no red squigglies

13:29:02
pedropnaves_: default page is 1, no ?

13:29:03
<transcript>: Probably just popping in briefly sitting in the park. Thought, checkin, juice. So good to see you. It's so good to be back on this stupid app on Twitter. It's not stupid. I love it. So good to be back next. What's your take on return types? My take is.

13:29:03
<transcript>: i'm realizing

13:29:17
<transcript>: I'm realizing how dumb I am that I don't have opinions on anything. I don't know what that means about me. Like I literally have no opinion. Like I guess I probably have used return types when I shouldn't.

13:29:17
<transcript>: but i

13:29:23
<transcript>: But I don't always like I don't know why I randomly would choose to or not.

13:29:23
thdxr: no opinion = good boy

13:29:25
nft_scam: i want  return to work too, been taking day off

13:29:26
<transcript>: I just don't have opinions. I don't know.

13:29:33
<transcript>: Was that mean? I've been doing this a long time. I should have opinion. Shouldn't I or is it only certain people that have opinion.

13:29:33
<transcript>: i don't know

13:29:36
<transcript>: I don't know. Someone tell me what that means.

13:29:39
<transcript>: He wants to return to work exactly.

13:29:47
texoport: Hi!

13:29:48
<transcript>: The vendor waiting so long for stream. Well, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here. Just watch the last two minutes at the other new video. Then you'll get dax's, take.

13:29:48
<transcript>: the legend

13:29:51
<transcript>: The legend is live Daxy.

13:29:51

<transcript>: Next.

13:30:05
<transcript>: Word Channel when I was like, hey, I could do one. I I'm a person on the Internet. I could I could make one and dio's, like, I'll think about it.

13:30:05
homuruu: Can you share your neovim config?

13:30:07
thdxr: Lol yeah

13:30:08
elicxlive: That debate was pretty silly. There are times when inferred would be better, and times when explicit would be better

13:30:10
<transcript>: So much burn. I didn't want to say anything else after that.

13:30:10
<transcript>: just left

13:30:13
<transcript>: Just left. No opportunity to come back from that.

13:30:13
<transcript>: use twitter

13:30:34
<transcript>: Literally just started using type ship a week ago. I'm just glad when there's no red squiggles exactly juice. That's how I feel. I've been doing it for a long time and I still just am excited when there's no red squiggles.

13:30:38
<transcript>: Default Pages one. Oh, thank you, pedro. Also, welcome to Chad.

13:30:38

13:31:09
cowfacedude99: I use go/javascript. so I don't care about the whole return type conversation LUL

13:31:14
<transcript>: Daxy, shoulda. You should have stuck up for me. Should have been like, oh, Adam would be totally good at this. He has a camera. He can say the words that you want to be said. I don't know why he doesn't want me to do it. I'm sorry. It's really dumb, but I just, like, don't know why. Like, why am I not good enough to do it? You know, I'm saying, I'm very self conscious.

13:31:14
<transcript>: okay anyway

13:31:16
<transcript>: Okay anyway.

13:31:19
thdxr: i laughed because I didn't get why he was picky

13:31:23
<transcript>: So, paige. Oh, you said default page should be.

13:31:25
thdxr: what made me qualified but you not

13:31:26
<transcript>: One.

13:31:26
<transcript>: okay

13:31:27
<transcript>: Okay.

13:31:30
<transcript>: Response data. First page.

13:31:33
<transcript>: Do thing.

13:31:33
<transcript>: i laugh because

13:31:36

13:31:40
texoport: Just saw your tweet. Is this the end of the mustache filters? :/

13:31:41
<transcript>: I don't know. I feel like there has to be a reason.

13:31:41
<transcript>: there has to be a reason

13:31:43
<transcript>: There has to be a reason that like.

13:31:44
pilferz: @cowfacedude99 i just joined and missed it - what are we advocating for/against? :D

13:31:47
<transcript>: It's basically anybody that wants to get on can but not me.

13:31:47
<transcript>: there's got to be reason

13:31:48
<transcript>: There's got to be reason.

13:31:48
<transcript>: okay i got

13:31:50
<transcript>: Okay? I gotta stop.

13:31:50
<transcript>: just our tweet

13:31:55
thdxr: he saw you use return types once

13:32:00
<transcript>: Just our tweet. Is this the end of the mustache filters? It is. I so I have an Amazon cart. No joke. They're saved for later in my Amazon cart of like every object.

13:32:00
<transcript>: a realworld

13:32:08
<transcript>: A realworld object that maps to one of the AR filters. So I had all those AR filters, like the mustache and the minion goggles.

13:32:08
<transcript>: all of them

13:32:11
<transcript>: All of them. I have real work objects that would look just like them.

13:32:11
<transcript>: the wig

13:32:13
<transcript>: The wig, all of it.

13:32:26
<transcript>: I just. I couldn't pull the trigger. I talked to my wife about it. She was not a fan. She thinks the whole thing so dumb. Like, why would you put that stuff on your face? And I just don't have a rebuttal. So. So I didn't get the rich objects.

13:32:26
<transcript>: he saw me

13:32:31
<transcript>: He saw me just return types once. That might be it. I mean, he's pretty sharp. He doesn't miss anything.

13:32:32
<transcript>: Okay.

13:32:32
<transcript>: so we're

13:32:36
<transcript>: So we're gonna get page so if okay so.

13:32:43
<transcript>: Response equals get a awake get page.

13:32:45
<transcript>: If I need like a counter.

13:32:49
<transcript>: Nope. Can't be a cop.

13:32:53
cowfacedude99: @cowfacedude99 there's a whole thread that started with prime+theo's stream last week I think

13:32:53
<transcript>: Counter equals zero or one. I don't know.

13:32:53
<transcript>: i guess we

13:32:53
texoport: The correct response to your wife is "the internet people insist"

13:32:56
<transcript>: I guess we won't do this up here.

13:32:56
<transcript>: let's say

13:32:58
<transcript>: Let's say like this.

13:32:58
<transcript>: counter

13:32:59
<transcript>: Counter.

13:33:03
<transcript>: And then counter plus plus.

13:33:05
<transcript>: Like that.

13:33:05
<transcript>: oh yeah

13:33:08
<transcript>: Oh, yeah? Yeah? So then we say if.

13:33:08
<transcript>: not

13:33:12
<transcript>: Not response break, I guess.

13:33:12
<transcript>: and then we'll just

13:33:15
<transcript>: And then we'll just have like a little array Const.

ilkou99: just pick one from the first 100 KEKW

13:33:50
<transcript>: I just joined and missed it. What are we advocating for? Against pilfers? Maybe somebody I got you, but we're advocating for and against returns and typescript explicitly typing versus inferring it versus av. Comp.

13:33:56
<transcript>: At least as of theo's video. That's how we're talking about this thing.

13:34:11
<transcript>: Just pick one from the first 100. There you go. That sounds a little unfair, although maybe you should get bonus points for being right on top of it. Like the moment I said, hey, people start this. This repo. People just did it. Well, they did it because they wanted a macbook, but.

13:34:11
<transcript>: what's

13:34:12
theslowdev: Adam, what is this font? It's awesomee

13:34:14
<transcript>: What's this? I don't need this one.

13:34:17

13:34:17

<transcript>: If there's not a response.

13:34:50
<transcript>: Oh, no. No. If not response data.

13:34:50
<transcript>: because that

13:34:50
pilferz: Hmmm.. yeah, that's a tough one. I guess it depends on what tooling you're using. If I'm working with the AST (or my own AST implementation), it's definitely way more helpful to have explicitly-defined return types on methods/functions.

13:34:51
theslowdev: I Love that you use NeoVim.

13:34:58
<transcript>: Because that'll be an array. And if it's zero items, then it'll be right. I don't know. Probably. So Where's it gonna happen.

13:35:04
<transcript>: Run the thing. That's gonna be a lot of calls. How many will that be.

13:35:05
sockthedev: I've paid for DankMono, Operator Mono, and MonoLisa 🙈

13:35:06

<transcript>: I just picked from the first hundred. Okay, I'm caught up. Oh, no. Yeah, that's a tough one. I guess it depends on what tooling you're using. If I'm working with the ast, does this infinite loop, that's what that's the worst that could happen is it could be an infinite loop.

13:35:35
<transcript>: okay

13:35:38
thdxr: lol

13:35:38
<transcript>: Okay, it is an infinite loop. I'm guessing.

13:35:43

13:38:12
theruggedbear: you started from page 2 ? Kappa

13:38:15
<transcript>: Doesn't the api return to pagination object with total results? Nope. We figured it out. We figured it out. Hooray equals object equals true.

13:38:22
<transcript>: Did I start from page two? Uhoh, I did start from page two. Wait. Did I start from bitch? Wait. What.

13:38:26
<transcript>: Oh I counter? Plus plus early.

13:38:26
<transcript>: i mean it doesn't matter

13:38:29

<transcript>: Right. I'm so many good repo. 1400 stars. We're good. Okay, now we need to get some GitHub.

13:38:42
<transcript>: Not get out. We need to get some Twitter.

13:38:45
<transcript>: Let's do this. Let's.

13:38:45
<transcript>: say

13:38:46
<transcript>: Say.

13:38:53
<transcript>: Console log. Well, we'll just say Const.

13:38:56
<transcript>: constant

13:38:58
<transcript>: Constant.

13:38:59
<transcript>: Log.

13:39:01
<transcript>: Stargazers.

13:39:03
<transcript>: Map.

13:39:08
<transcript>: I still haven't type information on this thing.

13:39:09
miche_____: [] is false if you check with ==

13:39:13
<transcript>: I don't right.

13:39:13
<transcript>: just

13:39:17
<transcript>: Just an any array. So let's make it an array of what.

13:39:23
<transcript>: Is this thing data is an any I thought this was.

13:39:30
<transcript>: Octokit response any number. Oh no. Is this an explicit return type problem? Get page.

13:39:30
<transcript>: like when

13:39:34
<transcript>: Like when I do this. This is tight. No, it's not.

13:39:39
<transcript>: Oh, I thought this would be Typed because it knows I'm hitting the stargazer thing, right.

13:39:45
<transcript>: Well, whatever.

13:39:45
<transcript>: we don't need

13:39:46
<transcript>: We don't need types.

13:39:50
<transcript>: We don't need types around here.

13:39:50
<transcript>: where we're going

13:39:57
<transcript>: Where we're going. We won't need types. We're just gonna look at the let's just do this console log, man.

13:39:57
<transcript>: i think

13:39:59
<transcript>: I think issues.

13:41:46
<transcript>: Does it not.

13:42:00
<transcript>: Oh, it works. Github. And then we got a bunch of usernames. Okay. So we're gonna have github ones. So we're gonna also have Twitter ones. And then we're gonna just choose one randomly.

13:42:06
<transcript>: Time's running out. People better get in on that entry.

13:42:06
<transcript>: or on that

13:42:07
pilferz: @pilferz The overcharging is the issue, since I keep it docked primarily. If I replace the batteries, it just happens again with my usage :(

13:42:16
<transcript>: You feel like such a carny? Like I feel like.

13:42:16
<transcript>: what

13:42:21
<transcript>: What is the feeling I have when I'm doing this? I really just want to give people things, but help them.

13:42:26
<transcript>: I don't know. And I feel like people. I saw some of the reply to something I did like this.

13:42:26

jerugba: When is deadline

13:42:39

13:43:05
<transcript>: unless

kedemel: can you cure my blindness

13:43:09
<transcript>: Unless the Twitter API is really really hard.

13:43:14
<transcript>: simdy

13:43:22
<transcript>: Simdy it's one in like 30 because there's also retweets, but you can retweet and then you have two chances. So your odds are the same.

13:43:22
<transcript>: but if you don't have

13:43:22
impostorengineer: even companies wanna use you to publicise their product by giveaways. I agree.

13:43:22
realkingphilippe: Do you ship to Russia?

13:43:24
pilferz: Better hurry up with that Twitter API unless you want to pay for access lmao

13:43:25
<transcript>: But if you don't have Twitter, then that would be bad. I cannot.

13:43:25
<transcript>: cure your bl

13:43:33
<transcript>: Cure your blindness. I saw that. I saw Mr. Beast get flacked for curing a thousand people's blindness. I don't get it. I don't get it.

13:43:36
<transcript>: Okay.

13:43:36
<transcript>: let's get

13:43:38
thdxr: can you make it so I win and that would create controversy which would make this even bigger

<transcript>: Let's get the Twitter stuff. Const what am I doing? I don't even have like a.

13:43:42
itssupermatix: How much of those tweets are bots? Kappa

13:43:45
<transcript>: Idea of how I'm gonna get the Twitter stuff Twitter API.

13:43:48
thdxr: and then I'll throw it away because I use Linux

13:43:54
<transcript>: Retweets look up authenticate do I have to do or can I just hit the Twitter api like without oauth or something.

13:43:56
fitzsimons_dev: @thdxr This is the best timeline

13:43:57
cennedy__: i have im cevdetardaharan lmao you said that send video from dm for macbook

13:44:01
<transcript>: Someone tell me.

13:44:07
<transcript>: Hurry, hurry up with the Twitter api unless you want to buy. Yeah, exactly. Filters the night.

13:44:21
thdxr: Adam is about to get sanctioned

13:44:21
<transcript>: I will ship to Russia. Question Mark. Assuming I can legally physically ship it to your country, I will do so if you live in North Korea, possible. I can't. I don't know. There's probably place in the world where I just literally can't ship something.

13:44:29
<transcript>: I guess. I don't know. I don't know the rules. If there's sanctions involved. I don't know. I'll show it wherever I can.

13:44:29
<transcript>: possibly ship

13:44:31
<transcript>: Possibly ship it.

13:44:31
<transcript>: as i said

13:44:36
<transcript>: As I said earlier, I shipped a keyboard to iceland. So if I can.

13:44:36
<transcript>: get sanctioned

13:44:37
<transcript>: Get sanctioned.

13:44:45
<transcript>: Mega uns that you would create controversy, which make this even bigger. There you go.

13:44:51
<transcript>: Then I'll throw it away because I usually that's funny how much of those tweets are bots.

13:44:51
<transcript>: great question

13:44:52
kedemel: I shipped my bed! Anyone remember those old KMart commercials?

13:44:52
joostschuur: You can generate an app token for Twitter

13:44:57
cowfacedude99: @thdxr LUL

13:45:04
thdxr: none are bots elon fixed

13:45:04
<transcript>: Great question. So if I can't verify the identity of the person who wins, if they can't like, respond to me coherently and be like, hey, yes, I'm ready. Here's my address. Then I will move to the next. We'll do it again. You know, I'm saying.

13:45:04
<transcript>: gener

13:45:08
<transcript>: Generate an app token for Twitter that sounds way better.

13:45:08
joostschuur: Question is if you can still register new Twitter apps right now.

13:45:12
<transcript>: That sounds way better than what I was about to do.

13:45:22
<transcript>: Oauth is awful if you can still register new Twitter apps right now. Oh question is if you can do that let's see developer portal. Let's try this.

13:45:22
daglee: Long time no C!

13:45:31
<transcript>: I'm gonna use the Twitter API.

13:45:31
<transcript>: that's funny

13:45:33
joostschuur: Because new apps used to require approvals. I think.

13:45:35
<transcript>: That's funny. I've just only ever used it for logging in.

13:45:38
<transcript>: Oh, so I've got access.

13:45:38

13:49:22

<transcript>: okay so

13:49:28

13:50:11
<transcript>: And I will reach out to them.

realjesusos: because that would count as an extra retweet right?

13:50:24
<transcript>: This quote retweet count as retweet. Yeah, I want it to. I want it to that cause an extra retweet. Oh, yeah, I guess they shouldn't get.

13:50:24

thdxr: @fitzsimons_dev I'm hoping to get a consistent schedule finally

13:50:27

13:50:27
<transcript>: should you

13:50:28
<transcript>: Should you? I don't know.

13:50:35
sazedworldbringer: wasn't it going to be like a dev-talent show instead of just a raffle?

13:50:35

13:50:39
ilkou99: needle is like axios

13:50:42
<transcript>: And we're gonna say, I guess I'm gonna add this needle thing. I don't know. It's kind of weird.

13:50:43
joostschuur: @thdxr Nice! I actually have two projects. One is a big work repo with Prisma being used in Keystone, but for the smaller side project I do want to give kyesley a try

13:50:47
<transcript>: Kind of weird. I don't know what needle is. Why did they make me.

13:50:50
<transcript>: Like it looks like it's just fetch.

13:50:54

<transcript>: Oh, man, just an http client. That's weird that they don't just say, like, use that or something. I don't know.

13:51:52
<transcript>: Like Axios.

13:51:56
<transcript>: Oh, oh, I just saw.

13:51:57
<transcript>: Who said that.

13:52:07
<transcript>: Says, wasn't it going to be like a dev talent show instead of just raffle? Yeah, my initial idea and I've got more macbooks to give away. This is just the first one I'm giving away.

13:52:07
<transcript>: the digital idea

13:52:10
<transcript>: The digital idea was like, I'm gonna do like a dev Olympics.

13:52:10
<transcript>: but

13:52:14
joostschuur: How are you going to line up GitHub accounts with Twitter handles? Your tweet mentioned double the chances for doing both?

13:52:16
<transcript>: But it just kind of like I asked people to submit a video. The videos I got were.

13:52:16
<transcript>: there weren't actually

13:52:21
<transcript>: There weren't actually that many. A lot of people just didn't understand because it was a dumb tweet. It didn't make sense.

13:52:33
<transcript>: And then just the more I thought about, like, what would this look like? How many people do I accept? And how many of us on a video can we? Actually, it's all gonna be remote. Like, I don't know. The whole thing just started kind of falling apart in my mind.

13:52:35
thdxr: Adam next giveaway make people fix merge conflicts for 24 hours and whoever does the most wins

<transcript>: I'd be curious if that's still around. What do you do, dax? When you run into a library that bun doesn't work with.

14:12:51
<transcript>: Do you get this frustrated as I just got pnpm.

14:12:51
<transcript>: install

crazy_wizz: probability of winning*

14:13:48
<transcript>: .07% chance of winning if you both retweet inside the repo. Good luck, everybody. We're still we're still probably 20 minutes away from actually.

14:13:52

14:14:14
<transcript>: I figured it was something.

14:14:14
<transcript>: easy

14:14:15
<transcript>: Easy.

14:14:16

14:14:50
<transcript>: And then another 37 quote tweet.

14:14:54
ohmymndy: @nexxeln Thanks! I really like Deno and its import system, the security mechanism. It is great for Typescript

14:14:58
<transcript>: Wives are only 1489 of them.

14:15:01
elicxlive: Maybe it doesn't include private users?

14:15:03
hacksore: is it paged?

14:15:04
joostschuur: Maybe that doesn’t get private accounts?

14:15:06
<transcript>: Is it like some people don't show up in the api for some reason. Doesn't include private users. That's what I was wondering.

14:15:11
zachrip: I think those numbers aren't always accurate either

14:15:13
<transcript>: Doesn't get private accounts. I bet that's right. Oh, that's not good. That means if you retweet it on a private account.

14:15:13
<transcript>: you would not

14:15:15
<transcript>: You would not be entered to win.

14:15:21

So I'm gonna have to tweak pretty quickly, like, stop retweeting it. There's a winner. I'm not gonna say stop starting the refo because I do want to see how many stars can get on that repo.

trivenge: he makes engineering and big content kind of like mr beast but his own way

14:48:31
<transcript>: Everything like this is what ideal looks like. I know like my last few have been getting like 10% clickthrough rates. I think is pretty good. And I think that mostly is the title and the thumbnail. And then the view duration is like your video doesn't suck. And most of my videos so far has sucked. So the view duration's not great.
