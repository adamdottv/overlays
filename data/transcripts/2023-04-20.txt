If my schedule says I'll stream at a certain time and I'm not streaming, I'm probably saying something in the discord that's just like the place I know to do it. Sometimes I might tweet, but probably not because, like who.

00:17:21
lowlevellearning: LMFAO I forgot about that

00:17:21
<transcript>: I mean, I know of you outside of that, like Twitter and all those things. But that's kind of like the thing we share in common that day where you knew how to poll and you were so good at it. And I was like, I'll just be a moderator. That sounds fun. I'll take the little tool or the little sword.

00:17:21
<transcript>: the sword

00:17:22
opti_21: lol my fellow prime mods

00:17:23
lowlevellearning: yeah

00:17:36
<transcript>: The Sword eats, Sing emote badge. What are they called? I don't know who runs that discord. It's me and dax ish. I guess all the streamers on the Watch dev discord have the same privileges. We all have, like, moderator privileges. So we kind of all run it together.

00:17:43
<transcript>: Any advice on writing tech presentations? I don't do a lot of presenting. I once spoke at my high school because.

00:17:43
<transcript>: i made

00:17:51
<transcript>: I made a startup, and the Superintendent reached out and was like, hey, you made a startup. Could you come talk to the high school about.

00:17:51
<transcript>: technology

00:17:58
<transcript>: Technology. So I went back to willow Springs, Missouri. I did a presentation. There were slides and everything. And I talked for, like, an hour.

<transcript>: Serverless and our transition to best practices, or at least establishing them. So like, the idea of serverless is what you're saying. Bodie can't tell that was the first word of the sentence. So you would have capitalized it just because English, but there's Serverless ink, which is kind of like a semi dying framework. Not a dying framework, but kind of like.

00:18:59
grasp5533: Late stream.  Let's go

00:19:14
<transcript>: The old way. And then there's like serverless. The idea like use managed services and don't have servers or manage them. Came here the other day. Just a type dot files. It's awesome. I haven't pushed my dot files in a while. They're a little out of date.

00:19:14
<transcript>: a little bit

00:19:16
<transcript>: A little bit.

00:19:23

<transcript>: It's going to say that.

00:23:11
<transcript>: so

00:23:21
<transcript>: So it should block off with the hideous upgrade to Pro message. Yes. Okay. So can't see all of them. I upgrade to Pro. Let's just make sure everything's still working. Sometimes I come back.

00:23:21
<transcript>: and things don't

00:23:28
<transcript>: And things don't work anymore. Rob is here at elmore. That's not what it is. Plus.

00:24:27
<transcript>: speaking of service

00:24:27
gitpush_gitpaid: i had my first production bug at this current job yesterday. had an insane run. been here over a year

00:24:32
<transcript>: Speaking of service, I've been trying to redo my project in sst running into problems. What are your problems, Turk.

00:24:32
<transcript>: ssc

00:24:34
<transcript>: Ssc is awesome.

00:24:35
gitpush_gitpaid: wasnt really a bug but ran into a production issue

<transcript>: My favorite thing about programming is when nothing works, same.

00:24:39
<transcript>: so

00:24:41
<transcript>: So we got our secret.

00:24:43

00:24:55
<transcript>: Let's just do this again.

00:24:55
<transcript>: we track

00:24:57
<transcript>: We tracked this down yesterday.

00:25:06
<transcript>: Oh, afternoon streams are weird. This feels so weird.

00:25:10
<transcript>: What am I doing? No, I want Lambda.

00:25:14
lesabotsy: @adamdotdev taking on prime head to head with this schedule

00:25:17
<transcript>: Lambda.

00:25:17
gitpush_gitpaid: setting it up Kappa i tried that onClick example the docs had and it gave me a weird response. gave up for the time being. going to leave it alone and just wrap up so i can deploy already

00:25:23
<transcript>: Let us hear taking on prime head to head with the schedule? Oh, boy.

00:25:23
<transcript>: i don't want to

00:25:26
gitpush_gitpaid: will revisit serverless later

<transcript>: I don't want to take on prime head to head. That's not my goal.

00:25:26
<transcript>: my goal

00:25:31
livemahs: going to lunch with some coworkers, hopefully you'll be on when I get back!

00:25:37
<transcript>: My goal is just to not always stream the same time. Who was it was Allison yesterday. Told me I should do some streaming at other times. I was like I could do that sometime. And then here I am today doing that.

00:25:37
<transcript>: right

00:25:39
<transcript>: Right this very moment.

00:25:39
<transcript>: okay

00:25:41
<transcript>: Okay. Here's our role.

00:25:54
gitpush_gitpaid: why do people make prime out to be like competing with the superbowl MaxLOL

00:25:54
<transcript>: The only thing I don't like about afternoon stream is I don't have a drink like I don't have a drink in my hand. I've already drank by my fake coffee.

00:25:54
<transcript>: that would

00:25:56
<transcript>: That would be the one.

00:25:56
<transcript>: monster

00:25:59
<transcript>: Monster stage DB Astro.

00:26:07
<transcript>: Not the authorizer. It's the checkout handler, right? Yeah.

00:26:24
<transcript>: Post checkout service role. That's the role. It's what I'm looking at, not a host secret value.

00:26:28
<transcript>: Which secret are you trying to? Let's see.

00:26:34
<transcript>: Get secret value.

00:26:40
<transcript>: Postgres secretarn. I just looked at that, didn't I.

00:26:46
<transcript>: Rds credentials. Secret, secret errand.

00:26:51
<transcript>: Rds? Credential secret is this one? If it's not prod.

00:26:51
<transcript>: then

00:26:55

<transcript>: Are there any other imports of it.

00:28:22
manbravegg: prime is funny. He definitely makes boring stuff fun to watch.

<transcript>: Oh, I reworked this code. That's what the problem is.

00:29:00
<transcript>: that's the

00:29:02
<transcript>: That's the problem.

00:29:04
<transcript>: Anytime you rework stuff.

<transcript>: You break stuff so post checkout and post stripe webhooked.

00:29:58
<transcript>: great

00:30:01
<transcript>: Great human. He's helped me personally and professionally.

00:30:12
<transcript>: I feel like prime is too weird to be pokey. More like xqc. What is it like knowing all these people on twitch? You guys know so many things? What is it like.

00:30:12
<transcript>: fanco

00:30:18
<transcript>: Fanco. Thank you for the follow. I don't know if I saw that one. Okay, so we did pmpm sso. Let's do.

00:30:23
<transcript>: Push the packages. What is that? In.

00:30:23
<transcript>: that's the

00:30:26
<transcript>: That's the stack itself, isn't it.

00:30:28
manbravegg: Its entertaining, thats what it is like.

00:30:28
<transcript>: So let's just do this.

00:30:30
<transcript>: Let's just do this.

00:30:34
<transcript>: We have node types in here. We do not.

00:30:39
<transcript>: Okay. I've never had to add them before.

00:30:43
opti_21: i've been on twitch before it became twitch

00:30:45
<transcript>: Pmpm, ad.

00:30:47
<transcript>: Pipes, node.

00:30:48
manbravegg: same

00:30:50
<transcript>: Just type node I don't know.

00:30:50
<transcript>: do you want to do

00:30:54
<transcript>: Do you want to do with the workspace? That's what I want to do.

00:30:54
<transcript>: so

00:30:55
<transcript>: So I do.

00:30:56
manbravegg: justintv squad represent

00:31:03
<transcript>: W? Is that what it is? Yeah. W should I do at 16? What version of note? Am I in note 16? Yeah.

00:31:05
<transcript>: At 16.

00:31:09
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:31:25
<transcript>: We need a background story on the real Adam. The real one. He's probably super rude, isn't he? Oh, boy, don't answer that, Rob. I'm not super rude. Did DAX ever get his mod satisfaction? No jokester. Dax will not be a mod in this channel. He's a VIP.

00:31:27
coffeytime26: Background on Elmo? I just hopped on here to hear him laugh. It‚Äôs like a new born child‚Äôs laugh, so infectious. :)

00:31:33
<transcript>: He's not mod material. Now the problem is dax is already abused his moderator privileges. He had it.

00:31:33
<transcript>: for like three

00:31:40
<transcript>: For like three minutes, and he went in and he messed with my commands. And now people are telling dad jokes, which is super dumb.

00:31:40
<transcript>: i mean not dumb

00:31:55
<transcript>: I mean, not dumb if you did it, you're just using what you've got, but it was dumb to enable it. Guys, how long after shopping? Caffeine? Do you not feel sleep anymore, lesa? It's a process. I've come off caffeine several times.

00:31:55
<transcript>: it's a process

00:31:58
<transcript>: It's a process, not a fun one, either.

00:32:05
<transcript>: I don't know that I know exactly how long, but I'd give it a week before you start feeling like a normal human being again. It really sucks.

00:32:09
gitpush_gitpaid: @CoffeyTime26 tech blog: Adam Dot Dev infects new born children

00:32:11
dnbull: I'm immune to caffeine. Does absolutely nothing for me

00:32:23
<transcript>: Here's the thing though, lesa, once you're off caffeine, once you've been off for some time and you're totally detoxed, you can have it like once every week or so, maybe every couple of weeks. And you feel amazing. And you don't have any withdrawals the next day you just have coffee one day.

00:32:23
<transcript>: like every

00:32:30
<transcript>: Like every one or two weeks. And you have a super awesome day where you feel great. You're on top of the world. Everything is wonderful.

00:32:35
opti_21: Coffey knows too much monkaW

00:32:41
<transcript>: And then you don't have to deal with the withdrawals somehow. One day is like, not enough. Your body doesn't build up like whatever it builds up, where you have to come off of it. It's really great. I recommend it.

00:32:53
<transcript>: I've been on twitch before it became twitch, just in TV, Justin, TV squad. Look at you people. You people with your cool names. Opti with the solar flare. What is that.

00:32:56
<transcript>: In the glitchcon 2020.

00:33:05
<transcript>: Background on elmo. I just hopped on here. Oh, he calls me elmo. Yeah, I just hopped on here to hear him laugh. It's like a newborn job.

00:33:07
<transcript>: That's funny.

00:33:08
pbertrand_dev: give me a sword and I will make sure Dax behaves

00:33:11
pbertrand_dev: Kapp

00:33:13
pbertrand_dev: Kappa

00:33:18
<transcript>: Adam dev infects newborn Children. Okay, great. Yeah. That's what you got from that immunity. Caffeine does absolutely nothing for you, Dean Bull. Caffeine doesn't do any of you ever.

00:33:19
opti_21: Another prime Mod!

00:33:22
gitpush_gitpaid: @CoffeyTime26 i need to hear something wild. does he go around town yelling at people that he runs a site with millions of people?

00:33:27
<transcript>: You know what, bertrand? You get a sword. You know why you get a sword because anybody who's good enough to be a mod for.

00:33:27
<transcript>: prime is

00:33:30
<transcript>: Prime is good enough to be a mod for me. You know what I'm saying.

00:33:33
pbertrand_dev: Kekw it worked

00:33:36
<transcript>: You've now proven to me you're good modern material.

00:33:36
<transcript>: if he

00:33:40
<transcript>: If he trusts you, I trust you. It worked.

00:33:42
dnbull: Pass the sword

00:33:46
gitpush_gitpaid: what does a sword do

00:33:46
opti_21: That's pretty much how Prime picks mods

00:33:46
<transcript>: All these mods, all the mods hanging out in my chat right now.

00:33:46
<transcript>: i need to hear

00:33:52
<transcript>: I need to hear something wild. Does he go around town yelling at people that he runs? Five, millions of people.

00:33:55
pbertrand_dev: Kreygasm

00:33:55
<transcript>: That's funny.

00:34:02
<transcript>: How does prime pick mods? How does he pick him.

00:34:04
<transcript>: Okay.

00:34:06
opti_21: randomnly

00:34:11
<transcript>: We're trying to figure out why.

00:34:13
<transcript>: This run. Dev? Why this isn't working.

00:34:21
<transcript>: And I added types node. So that's nice. This shouldn't be a problem now. So we're logging the function.

00:34:21
<transcript>: we're going to log

00:34:24
<transcript>: We're going to log the function now.

00:34:26
<transcript>: Let's see what happens.

00:34:31
pbertrand_dev: there is a pretty long 3 month interview process

00:34:33
<transcript>: Let's see what happens. What a bummer. I can't believe I'm back to fixing this stuff again.

00:34:33
<transcript>: but i had

00:34:35
<transcript>: But I had it all straightened out.

00:34:38
<transcript>: Does.

00:34:43
opti_21: like you make a funny joke, or even make fun of him and he's like, "you want a sword?"

00:34:46
<transcript>: A pretty long three month interview process. Really? Oh, randomly. Okay.

00:34:50
<transcript>: You make a funny joke or even make fun of him and he's like you want to.

00:34:52
<transcript>: That's funny.

00:34:54
<transcript>: All.

00:34:59
<transcript>: What happened here? Nothing happened here.

00:35:03
<transcript>: Didn't even hit the AP wait. Sst is not even coming up.

00:35:11
<transcript>: Did I break sst my adding node types? No. There we go.

00:35:14
<transcript>: Okay, let's try again.

00:35:17
<transcript>: Wrong browser.

00:35:23
<transcript>: No whammy, no way, no way, me. That's a big whammy.

00:35:23
<transcript>: okay

00:35:26
<transcript>: Okay. It's not calling it because it's cached.

00:35:27
pbertrand_dev: The salary is pretty good

00:35:31
<transcript>: It's got the authorizer's cache. I bet.

00:35:31
<transcript>: is this authorizer

00:35:31
techsavvytravvy: can't believe you're streaming rn

00:35:32
<transcript>: Is this authorizer.

00:35:36

00:35:41
<transcript>: Yeah, it's an issue in the authorizer.

00:35:46
<transcript>: Okay. Has it been a minute yet.

00:35:46
<transcript>: oh i think

00:35:50
<transcript>: Oh, I think I set it to five minutes. Bummer.

00:35:54
<transcript>: Five minutes. Yeah.

00:36:14
<transcript>: I can't believe you're streaming right now. Me neither. Trav. It's weird. It's kind of weird. I don't know if I like it. I mean, I like it. I just don't know how much I like it. I like streaming always because it's fun. I get to hang out with you people, but I don't know if I like it the afternoon hour.

00:36:14
<transcript>: or almost

00:36:16
<transcript>: Or almost afternoon.

<transcript>: he pays

00:36:22
<transcript>: He pays his mods.

00:36:22
<transcript>: i've heard of people

00:36:30
<transcript>: I've heard of people like splitting all the revenue from their channel with Mods. I'm happy to do that. It's not a lot of revenue. And I have a lot of mods.

00:36:35
<transcript>: It's like hq trivia. You guys can each win like a dollar 36 each month.

00:42:50
<transcript>: Okay, my segments are broken. It's supposed to do, like a whole nother thing. What's going on? Why are my segments broken? Dax, you broke my segments.

opti_21: everything do be broken

<transcript>: Okay. I want this to work. I want this to work. More than anything in life right now. Everything do be broken. Yeah, it's an afternoon stream. Last time I streamed in the afternoon, my Internet went out. Remember, at the end of the stream, it was like stuttering something overheated.

00:45:21
gitpush_gitpaid: is this really whole tech people party in miami?

00:45:24
<transcript>: I just trying to not always stream before everyone wakes up. Apparently if you wait and you stream when people are awake, they can come watch you.

00:45:28
<transcript>: Author prod Mother staging What's this.

00:45:30
<transcript>: This is the host.

00:45:46
<transcript>: All these functions should have access. It's still post checkout. Right. They get the keys, right. Oh, where is it? Post checkout. Post. Stripe, webhooks.

00:45:49
<transcript>: It has an authorizer on it.

00:45:49
<transcript>: i would be seeing

00:45:53
<transcript>: I would be seeing this the authorizer role failing if it was.

00:45:53
<transcript>: what

00:45:55
<transcript>: What changed.

00:45:55
<transcript>: post

00:45:57

<transcript>: rds

00:46:02
<transcript>: Rds Credentialseecret Grant read. Let's do this.

00:46:08
<transcript>: Do this. Let's just update it, make it deploy it without it, and then redeploy it.

00:46:11
iannery: unfortunately i'm working rn, so imma lurk for a lil bit

00:46:12
<transcript>: This really whole Tech People Party in Miami.

00:46:15
<transcript>: It's a react party so only a few.

00:46:15
<transcript>: if you

00:46:19
<transcript>: If you write react, not if you're into any technology it's got to be react.

00:46:25
<transcript>: Just like dax Big React Fan that dax microbit. Thanks so much for the follow.

00:46:25
kryotoboi: I am here too

00:46:33
<transcript>: Cryos here. No worries, Leonard.

00:46:33
<transcript>: blur

00:46:47
<transcript>: Blurk away. We only made fun of dax for lurking because he said he was leaving. But we know he's still here. We know he's still listening. Everybody's shuckling right now. He's still in that giant line for a burger. There's no way he closed the app. It's okay, dax. You could tell us. Just tell us.

00:46:47
<transcript>: you're still here maybe

00:46:51
<transcript>: You're still here? Maybe we'll do another dax facts and see if we can bring him out of the woodworks.

00:46:51
<transcript>: okay

00:46:56
aj_stuyvenberg: Lol looks like he did actually leave

00:46:57
<transcript>: Okay, we redeployed it. I don't think that's going to make a difference, but let's try.

00:46:57
<transcript>: in fact

00:47:03
<transcript>: In fact it explicitly doesn't have the permissions now, so it really shouldn't work.

00:47:06
<transcript>: If it works now, then.

00:47:11
<transcript>: I know nothing. Okay? It doesn't work. Same issue, though.

00:47:11
<transcript>: host check

00:47:16
<transcript>: Host. Check out. Oh, no, this is the authorizer. Did I see authorizer somewhere? No.

00:47:19
<transcript>: It's just the.

00:47:22
<transcript>: Let's check out a handler.

00:47:28
<transcript>: Do I need to add the region.

00:47:28
<transcript>: oh maybe

00:47:32
<transcript>: Oh, maybe I need to add the region. Let's do that.

00:47:37
cosmiclasagna: wow late stream good afternoon

00:47:38
<transcript>: Let's do that. So first of all, let's re add those.

00:47:38
<transcript>: and then

00:47:41
<transcript>: And then let's add the region.

00:47:44
<transcript>: To Where is that? Here.

00:47:50
<transcript>: We go I guess I could do.

00:47:50
<transcript>: like

00:47:52
<transcript>: Like.

00:48:04
<transcript>: I could not do this at the top level. Is that the issue? It doesn't make sense why it would be, but Region US East one.

00:48:07
<transcript>: Oh, no, I'm just going to hard code that let's see.

00:48:07
<transcript>: what

00:48:09
<transcript>: What could go wrong.

00:48:14
<transcript>: Let's try it again.

00:48:20
<transcript>: Late stream cosmic lasagna. What time is it for you in Southeast Asia? Probably pretty late.

00:48:20
<transcript>: looks like

00:48:26
<transcript>: Looks like you actually did leave. Okay, whatever it worked, why did it work? What happened.

00:48:32
cosmiclasagna: its 1 am here LUL

00:48:34
<transcript>: Just putting the region in there, worked. That's what it was. It was the region. All right.

00:48:34
<transcript>: okay

00:48:35
<transcript>: Okay.

00:48:42
<transcript>: I'll take it it's 01:00 a.m. Cosmic. What are you doing? Awake? What are you doing.

00:48:42
aj_stuyvenberg: bingo!

00:48:47
<transcript>: Why are you awake? At 01:00 a.m.

00:48:50
<transcript>: Bingo. Just missing the region. That's all it was.

00:48:50
<transcript>: good

00:48:52
<transcript>: Good to know.

00:48:52
<transcript>: okay

00:48:53
<transcript>: Okay.

00:48:58
<transcript>: So we pay for statues. It's going to take us back to samus.

00:49:04
<transcript>: It's going to take us back to stat, muse. It's going to log us in.

00:49:06
<transcript>: I think.

00:49:06
kryotoboi: Oh so Adam is transferring monies to our accounts?

00:49:11
<transcript>: Yes. No sign in token is Invalid. That's not good.

00:49:11
<transcript>: what did i

00:49:13
<transcript>: What did I break.

00:49:13
<transcript>: off

00:49:16
<transcript>: Off email callback.

00:49:16
ilkou99: leaked

00:49:19
<transcript>: Oh, was it so long ago.

00:49:20
cosmiclasagna: Work for a US company so I start afternoon my time

00:49:22
<transcript>: Did it time out.

00:49:24
cosmiclasagna: so I just got done work

00:49:26
<transcript>: I bet it timed out.

00:49:26
<transcript>: okay

00:49:32
<transcript>: Okay. So I need to fix that case, because that's I don't know if that's going to be uncommon or not.

00:49:32
<transcript>: so

00:49:34
<transcript>: So when we let's see.

00:49:37
<transcript>: Stripe.

00:49:39
<transcript>: Check out. There we go.

00:49:45
<transcript>: There we go. So when we send the email, where is that? We send it.

00:49:53
<transcript>: Create checkout session. Here we go.

00:49:53
amazingdavi: What was the issue with the secret?

00:49:56
<transcript>: So if you're an existing user.

00:50:00
<transcript>: Where is that.

00:50:07
<transcript>: Existing user no, it wouldn't affect existing user just for new users. We do get sign in URL.

00:50:14
<transcript>: So it would have been running this code every time. Right. Does that just get like, a cached one or something.

00:50:19
<transcript>: New sign in token change, set, repo, update.

00:50:23
<transcript>: Did I actually break it.

00:50:23
<transcript>: amazing

00:50:33
<transcript>: Amazing davy. The issue with the secret was I didn't specify the region and the secrets manager client. I think the reason that was actually an issue is that.

00:50:43
<transcript>: I was top level awaiting a get secret call, and I think maybe there's a state where the aws region environment variable is at set or something yet.

00:50:43
<transcript>: in like a pre

00:50:48
<transcript>: In like a pre boot state of the Lambda function aj. You'd probably know the answer to this, right.

00:50:51
<transcript>: Is there some state.

00:50:51
<transcript>: where

00:50:55
<transcript>: Where? Because I'm doing top level await it's fetching the secret.

00:51:00
aj_stuyvenberg: Yeah exactly

00:51:05
<transcript>: Like way too early in the Lambda invocation lifecycle, and it doesn't have a region to go on yet or something. I don't know, but explicitly saying the region fixed it exactly.

00:51:07
<transcript>: My intuition was correct.

00:51:11
<transcript>: Cosmic you actually got work done.

00:51:11
<transcript>: you work for

00:51:11
amazingdavi: nice

00:51:14
<transcript>: You work for a US company, so I start afternoon. My time. Okay.

00:51:14
<transcript>: what did

00:51:17
<transcript>: What did I leak.

00:51:17
<transcript>: i luku

00:51:20
<transcript>: I luku? What did I leak? Oh, no, I leaked something.

00:51:22
aj_stuyvenberg: You can read it out of the AWS_REGION var but that's not guaranteed to be set during init

00:51:25
<transcript>: So is Adam transferring money to our account.

00:51:29
<transcript>: No, I'm trying to get monies from everyone else's accounts.

00:51:42
<transcript>: You can read it out of the aws region bar, but that's not guaranteed to be set during a knit. Yeah. So there you go. So I just explicitly. I guess we could do the fallback. We'll do that first. I got to figure this out, though.

00:51:47
<transcript>: Well, actually, no, I don't need to figure it out.

00:51:47
<transcript>: i just need to

00:51:48
<transcript>: I just need to.

00:51:50
<transcript>: Aw.

00:51:51
<transcript>: aws

00:51:51
<transcript>: aws region

00:51:55
gitpush_gitpaid: question, what made you guys settle on the price point for the subscription?

00:51:59
<transcript>: Aws Region or usc. How about that? That way, we're not always hard coded eos one. It can pull from the environment. Okay.

00:52:01
<transcript>: Then I guess that.

00:52:04
<transcript>: Does the secret ID.

00:52:08
<transcript>: Exist there. I don't know. We'll see.

00:52:12
<transcript>: Okay, let's just test it again. We're going to go through the whole thing again.

00:52:14
<transcript>: Pro.

00:52:19
<transcript>: So it didn't log me in so I can just do this all over again.

00:52:19
<transcript>: adam rob

00:52:21
aj_stuyvenberg: yeah that should be perfect. I haven't had issues doing that except for a really early node16.x runtime preview, they have since fixed it. I think that should be fine in production.

00:52:24
<transcript>: Adam. Rob is here too. I don't even know if Rob is here anymore, but we're going with that.

00:52:24
<transcript>: question

00:52:27
<transcript>: Question what made you guys settle on the price point for the.

00:52:29
<transcript>: Subscription.

00:52:29
<transcript>: great

00:52:31
pbertrand_dev: @adamdotdev Can I tell you a secret?

00:52:45
<transcript>: Great question, turk. We have not settled. I put something in there. It was random. It'll probably eventually be like an actual tier system, because we have people who query Sat music like thousands of times a month. We have people who just do it like 50 and they probably shouldn't pay the same thing.

00:52:50
<transcript>: Yes, bertrand, please do tell me a secret. Please do.

00:52:59
pbertrand_dev: sk_test_JvFxzD2MY9hwe0nvdcjUxQv

00:53:03
<transcript>: I haven't had issues doing that except for a really early node 16 runtime preview. They have since fixed it. Okay. Should be fine in production. Cool. We only wanted to do things that are fine in production.

00:53:08
<transcript>: Because we're going to be shoving this thing to protection. What is that.

00:53:08
<transcript>: why'd

00:53:12
<transcript>: Why'd you tell me your test secret.

00:53:12
<transcript>: what is it

00:53:13
<transcript>: What is it.

00:53:13
<transcript>: what

00:53:13
techsavvytravvy: called it

<transcript>: What is that.

00:53:16
opti_21: KEKW

00:53:27
<transcript>: Called it. What do you call trav? You guys just trolling me, okay? It logged in that time. So it worked. I don't know why that didn't work that first time. My guess is it was some kind of a timeout.

00:53:28
techsavvytravvy: get it

00:53:32
<transcript>: Is this like a joke that you guys do in other channels.

00:53:32
<transcript>: called it get it yeah

00:53:33
<transcript>: Called it Get it? Yeah.

00:53:33

<transcript>: So we're logged in now. I know we're logged in because if I go to Pro, it'll have my email. Yeah. Okay. That's what we're going to do right now. So right now, we're logged back into stat muse. I should be able to get all of the results, most points in a game. It should give me the whole table now.

00:54:00

00:54:54
<transcript>: That is an open source repo. It is the astro rewrite of Satmus.com. It's not done yet.

00:54:57
<transcript>: But there it is.

00:55:07
cosmiclasagna: @adamdotdev ayyeeeee

00:55:09
<transcript>: This is an update. You should do bad exploit. Oh, is it opti? Wait, you don't even know. Do you even know what the update is.

00:55:12

kryotoboi: Can I trick people in buying a useless subscription if it were too expensive?

00:55:25
adamdotdev: !players

00:55:25
fossabot: The player illustrations on statmuse.com are illustrated by the magnificent Michael Walchalk (https://www.michaelwalchalkdesign.com/).

00:55:26
<transcript>: Lesa botsy, where the avatar of players AI generated.

00:55:37
<transcript>: No, the avatars are illustrated by a guy named Michael Walshock. He's worked at sap Music for like seven years. And that's what he does every single day as he draws players in illustrator.

00:55:37
<transcript>: he's very

00:55:42
<transcript>: He's very talented and he never gets bored of it, apparently because he's been doing it for seven or eight years.

00:55:48
<transcript>: Can I trick people in buying a useless subscription if it were too expensive.

00:55:51
lesabotsy: DAMN that's some dedication ...

00:55:53
<transcript>: What do you mean, cryo? Can you trick people into buying a useless subscription if it were too expensive.

00:55:57
opti_21: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ08sst7kco

00:55:58
<transcript>: You're talking about that means like we're going to trick people.

00:55:58
<transcript>: it's not

00:56:02
<transcript>: It's not going to be useless, or you're saying something you're doing.

00:56:02
<transcript>: yeah

00:56:06
delvoid: tell him to draw you

00:56:08
<transcript>: Yeah, that's some dedication. What is this? Opti? I don't know. Do I open this YouTube video.

00:56:08
<transcript>: do i trust

00:56:10
<transcript>: Do I trust you.

00:56:17
<transcript>: Trusting you another urgent video. Oh, it's a real thing.

00:56:17
<transcript>: there's

00:56:19
<transcript>: There's a real exploit.

00:56:21
pbertrand_dev: Sup dilfoid

00:56:24
<transcript>: What's the exploit. They're going to steal my I mean.

00:56:24
<transcript>: i'm a guy

00:56:27
<transcript>: I'm a guy that still uses lastpass.

00:56:29
lesabotsy: Do you pay him per image or something? haha

00:56:30
<transcript>: So that's how I feel about security.

00:56:31
delvoid: @pbertrand_dev hello peepee

00:56:33
cosmiclasagna: @Delvoid yeah draw the whole team! then put it somewhere in the new astro site

00:56:35
<transcript>: Zero day. That sounds bad.

00:56:35
opti_21: oh gah

00:56:37
opti_21: lol

00:56:42
<transcript>: Uhoh.

00:56:50
<transcript>: Tell him to draw you. He has drawn me. Actually, Delvoid. I don't know.

00:56:52
kryotoboi: No not statmuse, I can start a newsletter or something thats just random stuff. But its gonna be really expensive so people will think it must be legit

00:57:02
<transcript>: I don't know if I can find the illustration of me, but he has drawn me. He's drawn the whole team for like off site stuff. I don't think any of our team Stuff's on here anymore.

00:57:06
<transcript>: Okay.

00:57:06
<transcript>: i believe you

00:57:13
<transcript>: I believe you. It's an it's a serious exploit. I need to update my browser. I will do it later today. Probably if I remember.

00:57:15
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:57:15
<transcript>: there's no

00:57:21
gitpush_gitpaid: you should put an easter egg of your drawing on the site

00:57:22
<transcript>: There's no are any of these like images that I could deduce open.

00:57:25
<transcript>: Inspect.

00:57:29
<transcript>: What is this.

00:57:29
<transcript>: oh there it

00:57:36
<transcript>: Oh, there it is. So stat app. I just wonder if there's like an atom PNG.

00:57:38
<transcript>: I could just hear.

00:57:38
<transcript>: adam

00:57:40
<transcript>: Adam.

00:57:40
<transcript>: nope

00:57:42
<transcript>: Nope, it's not. It.

00:57:42
<transcript>: adam

00:57:44
<transcript>: Adam melmore? No.

00:57:46
<transcript>: nope

00:57:46
<transcript>: nope okay

00:57:52
gitpush_gitpaid: try elmo

00:57:52
<transcript>: Nope. Okay. Well, there is an illustration of me out there somewhere while Talk has done our whole team at one point, he did our whole team.

00:58:02
<transcript>: Do you pay him per image or something? No, he's just a full time employee. He's just salaried lesa. That's what he does. It's his job.

00:58:02
<transcript>: draw

00:58:06
<transcript>: Draw. The whole team put it somewhere in the new astro site. Yeah.

00:58:06
<transcript>: we've still got

00:58:12
<transcript>: We've still got all the old illustrations. I'm sure we might put a team page on the new astro site. Maybe.

00:58:12
<transcript>: no not

00:58:32
<transcript>: No, not Sam. Means I can start a newsletter or something. That's just random stuff, but it's going to be really expensive. So people will think it must be legit. Oh, I see what you're saying. Cryo. Yeah, people totally buy stuff because it's expensive. I know this because I'm a person who buys stuff because it's expensive. If there's two things and one's more expensive, I assume it's better and I'll buy it. Rod, thank you for the follow.

00:58:38
<transcript>: You should put an Easter egg of your drawing on the site. Try Elmo.

00:58:38
<transcript>: so we used

00:58:58
<transcript>: So we used to have an Easter egg. James harden beard density. We used to have a couple of Easter eggs. Now we also have it. My wife made a little illustration. It looked like our shot charts. But it was like James harden's beard because somebody had searched this in the early statues days. And there's like a trending page. And it was like on the home page. And everybody saw it. So.

00:59:03
cosmiclasagna: LUL LUL LUL

00:59:07
<transcript>: Tons of people ask the question because they saw someone else asked it. So we put a little Easter egg in there where it actually had, like, a big image of his face. It was pretty cool.

00:59:07
<transcript>: that was like

00:59:10
<transcript>: That was like a whole day of effort.

00:59:21
<transcript>: Okay, here we go. We got to make the home page obvious that you're logged in. I don't know if I want to do it in the top corner, or maybe down here, like a little login thing. What's this look like on mobile.

00:59:26
<transcript>: So we could put it down here at the bottom.

00:59:26
<transcript>: like

00:59:29
<transcript>: Like your profile or something.

00:59:29
<transcript>: i

00:59:34
<transcript>: I button for logging out, and a button for managing your account.

00:59:40
dmdboi: Yo

00:59:42

00:59:57
<transcript>: Okay, we got to do that. Oh, first thing I'm going to do is just hide the video ads.

01:00:02
<transcript>: These video ads right here are just going to go away when you're a paid user.

01:00:04
<transcript>: So let's do that.

01:00:06
<transcript>: It's kind of an easy win.

01:00:06
<transcript>: i like

01:00:08
<transcript>: I like easy wins.

01:00:10

01:01:47
raj_srx9: @gitpush_gitpaid yeah, its boring especially if you are fresher

01:01:51
<transcript>: Opiate is Chris steeley. What.

01:01:51
opti_21: it is, I know that mando anywhere

01:01:56

01:01:59
<transcript>: We were on the very front row.

01:01:59

<transcript>: I think this is this Goat rodeo Sessions. I think or is this nickel Creek? I don't even know it's nickel Creek. Now he's got rody Sessions. Goat rodeo Sessions. This is like him playing with yoyo Ma and a bunch of other amazing musicians.

01:02:22
<transcript>: Rods. Welcome to Chat. It's boring. Especially if you are fresher.

01:02:28
gitpush_gitpaid: @gitpush_gitpaid not new... but man... everything has to be a meeting for some reason.

01:02:30
opti_21: I loved "Live From Here"

01:02:32
cosmiclasagna: @gitpush_gitpaid tell me about it... scrums feel so counterproductive most times

01:02:35
<transcript>: What are you guys talking about? Working at large companies is so slow. Yeah. You need to work at a small startup. Good idea. How are you handling off cool pants? We have already. What was this? Cloud narrative? What is this.

01:02:35
<transcript>: copy link

01:02:36
<transcript>: Copy, link.

01:02:36

01:02:43
<transcript>: s

01:02:54
<transcript>: S. Gray. Welcome to Chat. Thank you for finding my illustration. That Is Me as drawn by Michael Walchock, Cool Pants were handling off through like a sign in token, like a magic link.

01:02:59
gitpush_gitpaid: @gitpush_gitpaid i made an obvious change and still a mess

01:03:01
<transcript>: I've been in meetings and chats all day about a simple change. Yeah, I don't do those kind of meetings anymore.

01:03:07
<transcript>: Not new but man, everything has to be a meeting for some reason.

01:03:07
<transcript>: i loved

01:03:09

<transcript>: live from

01:03:14
dnbull: That's not you, that's kevin love adamdevKappa

01:03:14
<transcript>: Live from here. Is that just a Chris sealy album? Or is that what is Live from here.

01:03:18
<transcript>: I mostly only listen to like all of nickel Creek stuff.

01:03:21
<transcript>: And the goat Radio Sessions album.

01:03:27
gitpush_gitpaid: the change caused a huge bug in production Kappa all those meetings ended up being for no reason

01:03:32
<transcript>: Tell me about it. Scrum feels so counterproductive most times. And I have feelings about all that I made an obvious change and still a mess. That's not you. That's Kevin love.

01:03:39
<transcript>: Okay. I don't think this is the video ads actually.

01:03:42
<transcript>: Com. Let's see here.

01:03:49
<transcript>: Loading ad. Or maybe it is. Yeah, maybe it is. But it's like on top of the this day and SATS thing.

01:03:53
<transcript>: We'll see.

01:03:53
<transcript>: case

<transcript>: Case League.

01:04:03
<transcript>: Jwplayer.com. What is that.

01:04:05
gitpush_gitpaid: let me scale that back. wasnt even huge. just.... pointless

01:04:07
<transcript>: I think it's this I think it might be this.

01:04:11
<transcript>: So where we render it is right here.

01:04:11
<transcript>: and we only

01:04:19
<transcript>: And we only want to render it if they're not a paid user. Okay. So let's just comment it out and let's just make sure I got the right thing.

01:04:19
<transcript>: got

01:04:21
<transcript>: Got the right thing.

01:04:21
<transcript>: that should just

01:04:25
<transcript>: That should just go away. Come on now.

01:04:28
<transcript>: Come on now.

01:04:29
opti_21: oh it was his NPR show, where they travelled around the country and played music live, and like comedy radio stories. but sadly the big C killed it

01:04:32
<transcript>: Well, did I break it? Did I break the markup.

01:04:35
<transcript>: We'll just delete it.

01:04:42
<transcript>: Latest stats. Html. Is that different? Yeah. There goes. So there goes the video.

01:04:52
<transcript>: Now let's do it optionally. Let's conditionally. So here like an if else statement. So here.

01:05:00
<transcript>: If.

01:05:00
<transcript>: okay

01:05:01

01:05:14
lesabotsy: You have all the data, who do you think will win the NBA this season?

01:05:16
<transcript>: This is home index. Html. So I need to find the controller. Is it going to be like home controller or something.

01:06:56
<transcript>: You mean like the Championship.

01:07:04
<transcript>: I have no idea. I've not been following the NBA for several years now. Let's go with.

<transcript>: In the playoffs.

01:07:09
<transcript>: Let's go with the.

01:07:14
<transcript>: Suns because I don't know. Kevin durant plays there.

01:07:30
<transcript>: The Sun's still in it. Yeah, they're playing the clippers or the four seed. Who are the one seeds? Probably like the Celtic. Okay, the celtics are a two seed. I kind of vaguely know who good teams are. Okay, so Denver is the one seed in the west because they've got Yokich.

01:07:30
<transcript>: and then

01:07:33
<transcript>: And then the east. Who's the east? One seed.

<transcript>: Nocks, of course, janice in the Bucks. Okay, so celtics are two. Grizzlies are two. We got some tied up. One, one series. The warriors coming in as a six seed. Don't sleep on them. Ever.

01:08:00

<transcript>: You have all the data. Oh, yeah, I just answered that. Grab. Adam has a script for the finals already. They're waiting to upload the results. Still, Michael or mikael, welcome to Chat. The implicit controller template mapping in Phoenix is always so confusing. It's so confusing. Okay, thank you. Why do I get so lost in this code base? I get so lost.

01:09:45
<transcript>: It's just so many files.

01:09:45
<transcript>: you want to see how many

01:09:49
<transcript>: You want to see how many files? Oh, my word. Let me show you how many files.

01:09:49
<transcript>: let me show

01:09:55
<transcript>: Let me show you how many files are in this code base. I'm just randomly opening directories. Look at this. The.

01:09:55
<transcript>: serial

01:10:02
<transcript>: Serializers and views and controllers. There's multiple controller directories. I'm going to get lost.

01:10:07
lesabotsy: @gitpush_gitpaid I'll sub, better not be wrong though

01:10:09
<transcript>: Look at this stuff. Just look at it. Look at all the elixir files. Oh, my goodness.

01:10:13
<transcript>: They're just everywhere, elixir. Everywhere you look.

01:10:23
<transcript>: Just like controllers and utils. And Where's the other controller directory? There's another one, I promise.

01:10:27
<transcript>: Just everywhere. I'm just surrounded by elixir files.

01:10:28
gitpush_gitpaid: not to downplay the complexity of statmuse but that looks like a ridiculous amount of files

01:10:31
<transcript>: So many files.

01:10:34
<transcript>: It's obnoxious I get so lost.

01:10:37
<transcript>: This Views Directory. There's another Views directory.

01:10:37
<transcript>: it's just

01:10:39
<transcript>: It's just so much.

01:10:39
<transcript>: what

01:10:43
4ohfournotfound: would you feel better if it were lesser files with more LOC?

01:10:45

01:11:02
<transcript>: it's just

01:11:05
<transcript>: It's just an obnoxious amount of code.

01:11:05
<transcript>: and i can't

01:11:10

01:11:17
iannery: why snake_case on file_names

01:11:30
<transcript>: Invisible. What? I just see. Invisible. Something invisible. Magic destroys. Maintainability. Yeah, this many files destroys. Maintainability too. Does the sign in set a cookie or token? I know the Astro site must be a cookie due to ssr is elixir the same.

01:11:33
<transcript>: It is a cookie. Yes.

01:11:39
<transcript>: It is a cookie. I'm trying to figure out what you mean. By token. You mean like a jot. Token.

01:11:39

<transcript>: Adam dev selling in Bay Finals results for Saturday subscriptions. I love it. Go Sports, joke it. Don't joke. Itch should be the MVP. Denver does not make playoffs without him and they're the one seed, no less. Any reason stamus doesn't do F One or soccer. We should haven't gotten to it yet. We want to add epl and IPL.

01:12:11
<transcript>: and i don't know

01:12:17
<transcript>: And I don't know F One has never really come up until I started streaming, and then everybody's like, hey, you should add F one.

01:12:17
<transcript>: so i guess

01:12:26
<transcript>: So I guess we should not to downplay the complexity of samus, but that looks like a ridiculous amount of files. It is a ridiculous metaphiles ludicrous, even.

01:12:26
<transcript>: like

01:12:32
<transcript>: Like stamus is not that much. The site does not do them much. Okay? I don't understand.

01:12:41
<transcript>: And the developers who built this, they're very smart people, like, I'm sure there's reasons, you know what? We built features over time that we ended up shuttering.

01:12:41
<transcript>: so

01:12:46
<transcript>: So some of it is stuff you can't see on the site on purpose but still.

01:12:46
<transcript>: everything is

01:12:49
gitpush_gitpaid: like i work at a pretty large company and i dont think we have that many files lol

<transcript>: would you

01:13:01

Personally, I'm a kebab guy, but whatever it's fine, can Mothra or whatever the back end name was, make predictions? No, we don't make any predictions. Like if you ask stat muse, if you're like, who's going to win the Lakers game.

01:13:29

<transcript>: If is paid user it's actually if not.

01:15:02
<transcript>: is

01:15:10
<transcript>: Is it just like this in elixir. You think I would know this, do you? Invert with an exclamation Mark. Wow. I don't even know the most basic of basic.

01:15:15
<transcript>: Now.

01:15:25
<transcript>: It should show up. Wait, I am a paid user, so yeah, it shouldn't show up and then if I flip the is paid user thing.

01:15:28
<transcript>: Here somewhere.

01:15:28
<transcript>: yeah

01:15:30
<transcript>: Yeah if I say this.

<transcript>: Is false.

01:15:36
<transcript>: It should show the ads again. Right.

01:15:39
<transcript>: I think.

01:15:49
<transcript>: One thing I was not prepared for streaming. The afternoon is how tired my eyes would feel. Is this just afternoons for me? Do my eyes get tired.

01:15:55
pbertrand_dev: nope, inversion is with a + in elixir

01:15:56
<transcript>: Okay. So that worked. So I just need to set this to a real value now. And the way I'm going to do that.

01:15:56
<transcript>: is

01:15:58
<transcript>: Is enforcer.

01:16:03
<transcript>: No, that's not the one.

01:17:21
<transcript>: i know

01:17:27
<transcript>: I know. It had to have been discussed. Have you guys discussed implementing the Chat Gbtvi? Yeah, no.

01:17:27
<transcript>: we're looking into

01:17:32
<transcript>: We're looking into how we can use AI to make things better at Stanus.

01:17:38
<transcript>: It might look like a lot of things. Tools for creators to create sports content. My.

01:17:38
<transcript>: look like i

01:17:51
<transcript>: Look like I'd like to create like a summary thing. Like you have your favorite teams. And there's people on podcast every day talking about your team. There's people all over the Internet talking about your team. I like to create using Chad, gbt or something else.

01:17:51
<transcript>: like

01:17:57
dmdboi: Can it rig games so we can win bets?

01:18:10
<transcript>: Like summarize the mountain of information about your team every day into, like a nice, distilled little audio bite. That's like Scott Van pelt telling you, I don't know. Here's what people are saying about your team today. This person said this on this podcast. This person did that jagubgi is really good at summarizing stuff. And that's my new thing. I just want to use it to distill information.

01:18:14
<transcript>: Can it rig game so we can win bets? Probably not.

01:18:20
<transcript>: Don't think it's capable. Okay, so now if I log in or log out auth.

01:18:25
dmdboi: That sounded like a yes to me

01:18:29
<transcript>: I should see Ads. Yeah. Okay. If I log in.

01:18:29
<transcript>: so off

01:18:31
<transcript>: So off sign in.

01:18:31
<transcript>: i'm going to

01:18:36
gitpush_gitpaid: well cant you do that already with podcasts? there has to be api's for the transcripts no?

01:18:39
<transcript>: I'm going to sign in with email, and it's going to be this one. Now. I need to go to my email. No, I need to just do this.

01:18:43
<transcript>: Sign in token URL like that.

01:18:47
<transcript>: And then.

01:18:59
<transcript>: There we go. No Ads. I'm a paid user. Now, what if I go into stripe and I cancel this user's account? Rob is here. Let's do this.

01:19:01
<transcript>: Let's.

01:19:05
<transcript>: Oh, subscription. Right here.

01:19:08

01:19:14
<transcript>: So if I cancel it at the end of the period, it shouldn't change their status. Right.

01:19:18
<transcript>: If I say end of period, they should stay active.

01:19:18
<transcript>: until

01:19:19
<transcript>: Until.

01:19:19
<transcript>: the end of

01:19:20
pbertrand_dev: Pog, GPT knows you

01:19:21
<transcript>: The end of the period I believe.

01:19:26
<transcript>: So this should still hide the ads if I refresh.

01:19:28
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:19:28
<transcript>: why can't

01:19:34
<transcript>: Why can't you do that already with podcasts there has to be APIs for the transcripts. No.

01:19:43
<transcript>: That's not like a guess to me. Can't you do that already with podcasts, there has to be apis for the transcripts. Yeah, but if we had all the transcripts, I'm saying use.

01:19:43
<transcript>: ai

01:19:47
<transcript>: Ai to summarize the transcript so.

01:19:47
<transcript>: take

01:19:52
<transcript>: Take lots and lots of information out there about your favorite teams on a daily basis.

01:19:52
<transcript>: and dist

01:19:55
opti_21: that's correct, doesn't change to cancelled until the end of the period

01:19:59
<transcript>: And distill it into a short list of bullet points that are consumable within a few minutes. You know what I'm saying.

01:19:59
<transcript>: i just want to be

01:20:28
<transcript>: It doesn't change to canceled until the end of the period. Okay, cool. So that worked as intended.

01:20:28
<transcript>: now

01:20:30

<transcript>: Is it wrong? Or does it already know.

01:35:09
<transcript>: I asked it to rewrite your mission, but make it evil.

01:35:09
<transcript>: that

01:35:11
<transcript>: That's funny.

01:35:24
<transcript>: Okay, I should focus. Let's do stuff back here. Okay. We're doing a new user. Oh, this time we're going to do the card. Did it work? No. This time we're going to do the card. That is not going to work.

01:35:24
<transcript>: the one that

01:35:29
<transcript>: The one that's going to be a failed payment. And I don't know what I'm going to test.

01:35:33
<transcript>: That it fails, I guess.

01:35:33
<transcript>: that

pbertrand_dev: let's make the world a better place, one sports stat at a time

01:35:36
<transcript>: That seems like it's on their end.

01:35:36
<transcript>: i guess

01:35:39
<transcript>: I guess it's just making sure I don't give them access.

01:35:43
<transcript>: To the service if it's a failed payment.

01:35:43
<transcript>: is that the

01:35:45
<transcript>: Is that the idea.

01:35:48
manbravegg: new business idea, be the modern internet version of fox and use chatgpt to defame all businesses. Kappa

01:35:53
<transcript>: Card was declined because of institutional fund try paying with debit card instead. Okay, we tested that one did it check it off.

01:35:53
<transcript>: let's

01:36:05
<transcript>: Let's make the world a better place. One sports stat at a time that sounds like a pretty lame one. We probably came up with one time new business idea be the modern internet version of Fox and use chat gbt to defame all businesses.

01:36:10
<transcript>: Requires authentication. Let's try this one.

01:36:16
<transcript>: Subscribe.

01:36:20
cosmiclasagna: curious question: where are the ads from?

01:36:21
<transcript>: Here we go.

01:36:22
<transcript>: Complete.

01:36:40
<transcript>: How did clicking that button actually do anything? How did I authenticate anything about me? Curious question. Where are the ads from? So, cosmic. We did a deal with tsn. They're like the ESPN of Canada. I think ESPN even owns part of them. We did a deal with them. That's what the ads are all about.

01:36:42
<transcript>: Okay. So that one worked.

01:36:42
<transcript>: i guess

01:36:51
<transcript>: I guess the question is, Will it update the Activate your count thing? Use these cars. Test your integration. Once you're ready, activate your account.

01:36:51
<transcript>: to

01:36:55
cosmiclasagna: ohhh nice

01:36:57
<transcript>: To access live. What? Step two? Of four. Where's step three? What is step three.

01:37:10
<transcript>: Activate your account. Let's do that. Oh, I did it. It's done. I thought I was going to have more. You can now make live transactions if you need to change.

01:37:10
<transcript>: before you particip

01:37:11
syrkaz: lol

01:37:11
manbravegg: how did you collect all the data for stat muse? is it all scraped?

01:37:19
<transcript>: Before you participate, you might want to double check that you've done. Use your Live key. I did use your Live Public key. Yes. Enable https. Yeah. That's done. Okay. Cool.

01:37:21
<transcript>: Done.

01:37:21
<transcript>: and

01:37:52
<transcript>: This day in sats. Video. Html.

01:37:58
<transcript>: I could just update the component, but this day in Satsk video thing the problem is.

01:38:06
<transcript>: I'll have to pass the data in anyway, so I'll have to update all the references and this is a dying code base. We're not using it anymore.

01:38:06

01:39:53
<transcript>: dying code

01:39:59
<transcript>: Dying code base. Yeah. Will you also be streaming the astro rewrite soon? Yeah. Cosnic I'll get back on the astro react as soon as.

01:39:59
<transcript>: we're done

01:40:03

<transcript>: it's very

01:43:33
oskrm: Hydrate

01:43:36
<transcript>: It's very large. But other than that, elixir is kind of fun. I said it the other day. It like tickles your brain a little bit like doing functional programming. Just kind of feels nice. Sometimes it's nice for a change.

01:43:40
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow.

01:44:25
<transcript>: listen

01:44:29
<transcript>: Listen, turk, I don't think you understand. I'm from the Midwest.

itsmeleague: Yes

01:44:46
<transcript>: I've lived in the midwest my entire life in the ozarks. I am Kinder in real life than I am on stream. Like someone who knows me in real life would come on the stream and be like, Why do you act like such a jerk? Why is he acting like he's so cool? I'm much Kinder in person. I promise you.

01:44:49

oskrm: everyone is kinder in person

01:45:03
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't get mad at people. Like at service desks. Some people I know I'm not going to name names, but some people I know, like the rental car person is taken forever. They're super pissed and they let them know about it. You know what I mean? That kind of thing. I'm not like that. I'm kind to everybody.

01:45:03
<transcript>: we give everybody

01:45:10

01:45:14
syrkaz: the Midwest is the Canada of the US

01:45:24

01:46:53
<transcript>: probably the

01:46:55
<transcript>: Probably the player controller again.

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn‚Äôt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face

01:48:28
<transcript>: And resiliency. I don't know, but it's not Typed.

01:57:07
<transcript>: If Stammies becomes a unicorn animal, definitely. Or will for sure try to be Batman. Oh, that's a good idea. Bat Cave, the whole thing. I actually own the lot next door. We bought it, like last year.

<transcript>: Having like an underground cave in said lot thank you so much.

01:57:13

02:03:41

<transcript>: gain

02:04:01
<transcript>: Gain controller. Oh so games. Okay in musings and stories.

02:04:01
<transcript>: and

02:04:05
<transcript>: And fantasy football? Oh, in the Ask, controller.

02:04:09
<transcript>: Ask controller. So that's like every question, right.

02:04:12
<transcript>: Most points in a game.

02:04:12
<transcript>: and we'll

02:04:16
<transcript>: And we'll look at a game log.

02:04:19
<transcript>: Okay, no video ad here.

02:04:21
<transcript>: That's good.

02:04:21
<transcript>: should i

02:04:23
<transcript>: Should I let's just toggle.

02:04:29
<transcript>: I don't want to cancel it again.

02:04:33
<transcript>: Lightning alert.

02:04:33
<transcript>: it's in five

02:04:35
<transcript>: It's in 5 miles. I've never seen that before.

02:04:35
<transcript>: let's go to

02:04:37
<transcript>: Let's go to a game page too.

02:04:37
<transcript>: i guess

02:04:44
<transcript>: I guess I could get all these pages done and then just toggle it once and see if the videos are all gone. So no video on this one.

02:04:49
<transcript>: Okay, let's just keep moving. This day. In stats.

02:04:52
<transcript>: This.

02:04:52
<transcript>: day

02:04:52
gitpush_gitpaid: bum ass knicks

02:04:54
<transcript>: Day.

02:04:54
<transcript>: we've done

02:05:02
<transcript>: We've done player index and show we've done root show, visual. Got to do team. Oh, I've already done home, too, so just teams left, right.

02:05:05
<transcript>: Right.

02:05:05
<transcript>: i think it's just

02:05:07
<transcript>: I think it's just this one.

02:05:07
<transcript>: we're going to

02:05:10
<transcript>: We're going to have a conditional on this.

02:05:20
<transcript>: Where do I want to put it? This is already a conditional for it. Yeah.

02:05:20
<transcript>: so let's go

02:05:24
<transcript>: So let's go back to here and say if not.

02:05:24
<transcript>: is

02:05:25
<transcript>: Is paid.

02:05:28
<transcript>: User and.

02:05:28
<transcript>: that

02:05:36
<transcript>: That now I just need to find wherever we render this. What is this? Show season? So show season.

02:05:39
<transcript>: Multiple files? Awesome.

02:05:45
<transcript>: Is paid user.

02:05:45
<transcript>: enforce

02:05:47
<transcript>: Enforcer.

02:05:55
<transcript>: Come on. There it is. Enforcer. Is paid. User. Con.

02:06:04
<transcript>: There should be more show season renders. Yeah, that's one right there.

02:06:07
<transcript>: And then another one.

02:06:10
<transcript>: And another one.

02:06:12
<transcript>: All right.

02:06:17
<transcript>: All of them is paid user is paid user is paid user done.

02:06:17
<transcript>: okay so

02:06:22
<transcript>: Okay so that's team season. Now let's do.

02:06:24
<transcript>: This.

02:06:24
<transcript>: day instead

02:06:25
<transcript>: Day instead.

02:06:30
<transcript>: Team show franchise almost done.

02:06:34
<transcript>: Bum ass. Nicks. What's that about? Turk? Did they lose.

02:06:41
<transcript>: If not is paid user and.

02:06:41
<transcript>: that

02:06:47
<transcript>: That now we need to do wherever this is rendered show franchise.

02:06:47
<transcript>: franch

02:06:49
<transcript>: Franchise just one place.

02:06:49
<transcript>: nice

02:06:51
<transcript>: Nice.

02:06:53
<transcript>: Is paid.

02:06:53
<transcript>: use

02:06:55
<transcript>: User.

02:06:56
gitpush_gitpaid: the page you clicked displayed the knicks logo

02:06:58
<transcript>: User enforcer.

02:06:58
<transcript>: mod

02:07:01
<transcript>: Module no.

02:07:07
<transcript>: It happened. Show season no. How did I end it up there.

02:07:13
<transcript>: I want that. I want to type it manually.

02:07:21
<transcript>: Is paid User enforcer Get out of here copilot. Get out of here.

02:07:25
<transcript>: Con. Okay.

02:07:38
<transcript>: I think we've done it. I think we've blocked all the video ads. I believe so. Page you click displays. Next logo. I got you. So now there should be no video ads on games on teams.

02:07:43
<transcript>: Franchises or Seasons. So let's see, let's click on Warriors.

02:07:43
<transcript>: this should be

02:07:46
<transcript>: This should be thinking about it.

02:07:49
<transcript>: It's thinking about it.

02:07:55
<transcript>: Is so weird to be streaming at this time of day.

02:07:58
manbravegg: just turn of copilot if you dont want its help. hahah

02:08:01
fragaverage: I'm here, I'm here!

02:08:05
<transcript>: This is a team season Page no. Video ads.

02:08:05
<transcript>: let's open up

02:08:06
<transcript>: Let's open up.

02:08:10
<transcript>: Franchise page.

02:08:20
<transcript>: Also, no video ads. Right. Okay. Now I'm going to hit all these pages again.

02:08:22
<transcript>: But this time.

02:08:26
<transcript>: I'm going to do it as a not paid user.

02:08:30
<transcript>: For Customers test.

02:08:30
<transcript>: ten

02:08:32
<transcript>: Ten, cancel.

02:08:32
<transcript>: oops

02:08:33
<transcript>: Oops.

02:08:48
<transcript>: Cancel immediately. No refund. Frag is here. Frag is here. Just turn off copilot. If you don't want us help, well, I normally do want us to help man. Brave. The only reason I don't want to help in that case is because.

02:08:48
<transcript>: i'm trying

02:08:52
<transcript>: I'm trying to do the auto import thing and.

02:08:52
<transcript>: there we go

02:08:55
fragaverage: You're streaming too late, I had real life things to do LUL

02:08:58
<transcript>: There we go. Video ads. Okay. So no longer a paid user now gets video ads. Feels good.

02:09:01
<transcript>: Well, it feels bad. I guess if you're.

02:09:01
<transcript>: a user

02:09:10
<transcript>: A user of Sat Meals. But you're streaming too late. I had real life things to do. I'm so sorry, frag. I'll get back to the morning streams.

02:09:10
<transcript>: just a little

02:09:13
<transcript>: Just a little detour. Seeing the sights.

02:09:17
manbravegg: ohh really ? it breaks auto import if co-pilot does it?

02:09:18
<transcript>: Exploring a whole world out there at different times of the day.

02:09:18
<transcript>: also

02:09:23
manbravegg: interesting, did not know that.

02:09:25
<transcript>: Also just like I got partners, so I don't really care anymore. When I stream, I think when I was trying to get partner, it was like I wanted to be really careful.

02:09:25
<transcript>: and always

02:09:27
itsmeleague: Can you code in a backdoor so that I get a free subscription?

02:09:29
<transcript>: And always have my little crowd. Drazzo. Thank you for the follow.

02:09:33
nolset: second hardware question for ya, what keyboard are you using? sounds lovely

02:09:54
mr_yan19: how are the player thumbnails generated?

02:09:58
<transcript>: Okay done with that player. Pages should have ads on him too.

02:09:58
<transcript>: oh

02:10:00
<transcript>: Oh, really? It breaks.

02:10:00
<transcript>: auto

02:10:09
<transcript>: Auto import of copilot, does it? Yeah. Auto import only works for some reason if I hit enter when it suggests that the lsp suggests it.

02:10:09
<transcript>: can you

02:10:14
<transcript>: Can you code in a back door so that I get a free subscription? We'll talk it's me we'll talk.

02:10:15
gitpush_gitpaid: were you guys ever asked about being bought out by like a betting site like fanduel?

02:10:21
adamdotdev: !keyboard

02:10:21
fossabot: Adam uses a custom Mode Eighty mechanical keyboard, and has a collection of other Mode keyboards!

02:10:22
<transcript>: Nolset second hardware question for you. What keyboard are you using? Sounds lovely. So my keyboard is a mode.

02:10:29
<transcript>: And I'm using mode signal switches. But if I'm being honest.

02:10:31
<transcript>: Keyboard sounds amazing. It really does.

02:10:35
<transcript>: But having a nice shotgun mic.

02:10:35
<transcript>: is half

02:10:43
<transcript>: Is half a battle, like most people have a condenser mic or whatever. These are called like an sm seven B, and this thing is not picking up your keyboard.

02:10:43
<transcript>: but

02:10:49
fragaverage: Dang

02:10:53
<transcript>: But this overhead mic is not only out of the frame, which is nice. It picks up the keyboard. Really nice. So that's a little pro tip for you if you want to stream some ASMR.

02:10:57
<transcript>: Okay. We got video ads.

02:11:00
noctate12: I use 10$ keyboard it sounds awful but typing is also awful

02:11:04
<transcript>: Hidden or not based on the user's subscription. Okay, next things next.

02:11:04
<transcript>: use

02:11:09
<transcript>: Use a $10 keyboard. It sounds awful, but typing is also awful.

02:11:14
<transcript>: Sounds awful, but typing is also awful.

02:11:18
<transcript>: Okay.

02:11:24
<transcript>: It's getting so warm in here. I got to do something about the temperature. Oh, I could just turn the air down. That's a good idea.

02:11:28
<transcript>: That's a great idea.

02:11:36
<transcript>: Let's do this.

02:11:41
<transcript>: I'm just going to cool it down in here real nice.

02:11:44
<transcript>: It's getting warm.

02:11:46
<transcript>: Okay.

02:11:55
<transcript>: I kind of want to go into this little board thing we have. Oh, I shouldn't show that. That's fuzzy. Let me have, like, a board with a bunch of like to dos on it.

02:12:00
<transcript>: Going to just check off that I finished this task.

02:12:00
<transcript>: there's

02:12:01
syrkaz: @adamdotdev how are those solar panels coming along?

02:12:02
<transcript>: There's a few left.

02:12:05
<transcript>: This is the most project manage.

02:12:05
<transcript>: management

02:12:06
<transcript>: Management kind of stuff. I've done.

02:12:06
<transcript>: in like

02:12:08
<transcript>: In like years.

02:12:08
<transcript>: since

02:12:11
<transcript>: Since I rejoined Stamp use.

02:12:11
<transcript>: it's not

02:12:15
<transcript>: It's not very much just dragging cards around.

02:12:15
<transcript>: okay

02:12:18
<transcript>: Okay video player hidden.

02:12:18
<transcript>: done

02:12:19
<transcript>: Done.

02:12:22
<transcript>: Next up.

02:12:27
<transcript>: User Profile Page With Email. Auth.

02:12:30
<transcript>: Okay, so they should be able to update their email.

02:12:35
<transcript>: And then account deletion and link to stripe Payment management.

02:12:42
syrkaz: is that Jira? :P

02:12:47
<transcript>: Circas. How are those solar panels coming along? They're done. This stream is 100% powered by the sun. It's true.

02:12:52
<transcript>: We produce way more solar than we use.

02:12:54
<transcript>: Went a little bit overboard.

02:12:59
<transcript>: But, yeah, it's great. No, it's not jira. I don't even know what it's called. It's some kind of.

02:13:01
nolset: :O that's awesome!

02:13:03
<transcript>: Next cloud, I think, is what it's called.

02:13:03
<transcript>: next cloud

02:13:04
<transcript>: Next cloud.

02:13:04
itsmeleague: Is it true you spent 200k in solar panels

02:13:10
<transcript>: Yeah. So everything in our house is powered by the sun. Now our car is powered by the Sun.

02:13:14
syrkaz: oh

02:13:16
<transcript>: This stream, all of the electricity we use and will ever use it pays for our water bill.

02:13:16
<transcript>: we're producing a lot of electric

02:13:18
<transcript>: We're producing a lot of electricity.

02:13:21
warrenbuffering: grid has to buy it back from you at market, right?

02:13:22
syrkaz: that is incredible

02:13:37
<transcript>: So, yes, we spent 200,000 on solar panels. Well.

02:13:37
<transcript>: on

02:13:39
<transcript>: On a Solar system.

02:13:40
syrkaz: I was gonna say "free electricity" but.... yeah :P

02:13:42
<transcript>: The panels are just a minor part of that.

02:13:42
<transcript>: the

02:13:43
gitpush_gitpaid: generates so much electricity he gotta build a second house just to justify it

02:13:45
<transcript>: The batteries.

02:13:45
<transcript>: i think are the

02:13:47
<transcript>: I think are the major expense and the inverters.

02:13:54
<transcript>: But we're getting most of it back. In fact, I think we're getting all of it back.

02:13:54
<transcript>: and

02:14:00
<transcript>: And it's complicated has to do with taxes. But basically, since I make a lot of money.

02:14:00
<transcript>: and we

02:14:02
<transcript>: And we pay a lot in taxes.

02:14:05
cotrones: how many planets came with your solar system?

02:14:05
harry_kd: Yaay.

02:14:13
<transcript>: There are mechanisms. Mechanisms in place. Coding garden. Thank you so much for the Raid 67. My mouth is full. I'm so sorry. Welcome, Raiders.

02:14:14
elysiagriffin: Raidddd

02:14:14
ched_dev: Hiyaaaa codingHeart

02:14:19
harry_kd: @adamdotdev I brought the raid here because I love js. :D

02:14:21
<transcript>: How many planets? Game with your solar system. That was a good one. Welcome to Chat Coutrons. Alyssia alyssa is here.

02:14:22
codinggarden: gotta raid and run. Have a good stream!

02:14:24
syrkaz: give your accountant a bonus ;)

02:14:31
<transcript>: Got a raid and run. Yeah, no worries. I totally get how that goes. Welcome to Chat and thank you for the raid coating garden. You take care.

02:14:36
<transcript>: Give your account a bonus. So it's actually the solar company I bought them from.

02:14:36
<transcript>: the owner

02:14:41
elysiagriffin: Coding is out exploring the wilderness

02:14:44
<transcript>: The owner of the company is a cpa, and he's now kind of retired from Solar, and he just does this sort of exotic.

02:14:44
<transcript>: tax stuff

02:14:45
<transcript>: Tax stuff.

02:14:45
<transcript>: with people who

02:14:48
<transcript>: With people who have a high net worth.

02:14:56
<transcript>: So really, all I had to do was front the cash for this huge project.

02:14:58
<transcript>: And now.

02:14:58
<transcript>: we basically in the

02:14:58
syrkaz: that's awesome

02:15:03
harry_kd: CPA = cost per action? Thats

02:15:07
<transcript>: We basically in the next couple of years. Well, next year we'll get the rest of it back. We get a bunch of it from last year's taxes. They can amend last year's, some of it from this year's and then the rest.

02:15:08
harry_kd: very bad?

02:15:11
<transcript>: If there's any left. I think it's next year. So anyway.

02:15:16
<transcript>: It's all mostly coming back to me. The other thing somebody asked was.

02:15:19
<transcript>: What does somebody ask.

02:15:19
<transcript>: yeah war

02:15:25
<transcript>: Yeah. Warren Grid has to buy it back from you at Market. They don't in nixa. They don't. It sucks.

02:15:26
itsmeleague: That is super awesome

02:15:36
warrenbuffering: Oh really?? Here they do

02:15:38
<transcript>: In nixa. They just make it a credit. It's just a credit on your bill. So if you produce more solar than you use, it's just kind of like credits you for whenever you end up using it. I guess so. That sucks.

02:15:45
<transcript>: Generate so much electricity. You got to build a second house just to justify it. We do on the lot next door.

02:15:49
mr_yan19: My 17k system produces 120% of my consumption so I can only imagine at 200k USD

02:15:52
<transcript>: Let's see. Cirque Has coding is out exploring the wilderness. That sounds fun.

02:15:52
<transcript>: alicia i

02:15:55
nolset: so what happens with all your credits when you close your account?

02:16:02
<transcript>: Alicia. I didn't know you were here. Oh, you were in coding Gardens. I got you. You came in with the raid. Isaac, thank you for the follow. Late door as well. Thank you for the follow.

02:16:02
<transcript>: my

02:16:05
dmdboi: Build a solar farm next door

02:16:05
<transcript>: My 17,000 system.

02:16:05
<transcript>: seventeen k

02:16:06
dmdboi: Free money

02:16:08
<transcript>: Seventeen K oh kilowatt System produces 120.

02:16:15
<transcript>: So I can only imagine at 200,000. So Mr. Yan, I have a 26 kilowatt system.

02:16:15
<transcript>: but it's not

02:16:21
<transcript>: But it's not just a 26 kilowatt system. It's like these inverters are pretty special and expensive because.

02:16:21
<transcript>: each individual

02:16:30
pbertrand_dev: if I had a lot of space I would build a woodworking workshop

02:16:32
<transcript>: Each individual panel, doesn't they're not Daisy chain like they don't depend on each other. So I guess in traditional systems, if one panel gets like, beat up or covered up or damaged or something.

02:16:32
<transcript>: the whole system

02:16:52
<transcript>: The whole system can only operate at the peak of your lowest common denominator. Mine are all independent somehow. And then the battery array I know is like indefinitely. The house will stay powered as long as the sun is out to charge the next day it'll stay on for like long enough for the panels to charge it back up if that makes sense.

02:16:55
<transcript>: Okay. Let's get back to it.

02:16:56
mr_yan19: gotcha, micro inverters I think its called

02:16:58
gitpush_gitpaid: lmao adam wants to be away from people so much he bought the property next door just so no one lives next to him

02:17:00
<transcript>: What's next? I got to add a profile page.

02:17:00
<transcript>: not super

02:17:02
<transcript>: Not super excited about.

02:17:05
<transcript>: It's a lot of UI and stuff.

02:17:07
<transcript>: But I should probably just put it.

02:17:07
<transcript>: down here or

02:17:12
<transcript>: Down here or up here. Maybe like your account. Okay, let's just do that. Let's just get to it.

02:17:19
<transcript>: Said that what's this say trending. We'll just search for that Trending.

02:17:22
<transcript>: Menu Links aptly named.

02:17:22
<transcript>: okay let

02:17:24
<transcript>: Okay, let's do this.

02:17:29
<transcript>: I call it profile or account.

02:17:29
<transcript>: prof

02:17:31
harry_kd: can i get more info was to what cpa means?

02:17:31
<transcript>: Profile or account.

02:17:31
<transcript>: profile

02:17:33
<transcript>: Profile.

02:17:37
<transcript>: Oh, that's fine. Url. We'll call it.

02:17:40
<transcript>: Profile, I guess.

02:17:43
<transcript>: Is it your account or is it your profile.

02:17:43
<transcript>: i don't know

02:17:44
<transcript>: I don't know.

02:17:50
<transcript>: Not a lot of space. I would build a woodworking workshop. That sounds cool. Bertrand, do you actually do woodworking.

02:17:52
gitpush_gitpaid: feel like profile leans more towards social media

02:17:52
pbertrand_dev: certified personal adam. its when everyone has their own adam to help them

02:17:54
harry_kd: cost per action or smth else?

02:17:55
syrkaz: is it mostly to manage account or to expose to public?

02:17:56
<transcript>: What happens with all your credits when you close your account? Well, null said, I guess we just never close it. We just never leave and we won't have a problem.

02:17:56
<transcript>: will we

02:17:58
<transcript>: Will we.

02:18:03
<transcript>: I don't know. I actually don't know what happens with the credits.

02:18:05
slaxx4u: Account

02:18:06
<transcript>: Build a solar farm next door. Free money.

02:18:10
harry_kd: @pbertrand_dev hahaha :D that sounds good

02:18:13
syrkaz: profile for me is a public thing, account is my settings and billing stuff

02:18:19
<transcript>: Micro inverters that's right. Mystery on. I think that's right, too. Adam wants to be away from people so much. He bought the property next door, just knowing that's honestly why we bought it. We bought it so that nobody else built there. Because.

02:18:19
<transcript>: we have a big

02:18:28
<transcript>: We have a big opening on the side of us. So basically, we set on, like, three to four acres that no one can build on. And then.

02:18:28
<transcript>: but

02:18:44
<transcript>: But that's like in a big circle. So it's not that far to the next house, just like skip one lot, then the next house. But there's no house on the other side of us because it's like the end of the street. So we just have, like this big buffer where it's all ours to just kind of exist on. Can I get more info.

02:18:44
<transcript>: to what cp

02:18:48
harry_kd: @adamdotdev I was involved with a company called cpagrip. very bad company. the word cpa gave me naamflashbacks

02:18:52
dmdboi: Don't let him fool you, he bought that house with laundered money

02:18:53
<transcript>: To what cpa means. Oh, certified. Somebody. Certified. Professional atom accountant. Yeah, account is what that is. Slacks. Welcome to chat.

02:18:56
<transcript>: Cost for action, or something else. What was that.

02:19:00
itsmeleague: Im really curious what your house looks like lol, but I dont want you to dox yourself either LUL

02:19:01
<transcript>: Profile leans more towards social media. Yeah, you're right. Let's do account.

02:19:01
dmdboi: Slowly acquiring all land in Ozarks

02:19:07
<transcript>: Oh, somebody was saying, make an account, not accountant.

02:19:11
<transcript>: Match URLs We're just going to say.

02:19:11
<transcript>: account

02:19:13
<transcript>: Account.

02:19:13
gitpush_gitpaid: yea i definitely relate to that empty land dilemma you have while living in a nyc apartment Kappa

02:19:18
<transcript>: I even need to put that. Maybe I don't. It just goes off the yeah, I don't need to.

02:19:18
<transcript>: okay

02:19:19
<transcript>: Okay.

02:19:23
itsmeleague: @gitpush_gitpaid LUL

02:19:25
mehulsharmamat: Okay serious advice question time: I get so much concerned about how I should start posting tech YT content thing that I don't post anything. Wrote and recorded a script that I think is A. gonna be a bit cringe and B. not that good? Do I just push it out or make it a bit better where I'm not that embarassed by it. Although I always end up making these weirdly unfunny things so this mayyy be unsolvable

02:19:28
<transcript>: Let's see, is it mostly to manage account or expose the public? Oh yeah, circas it's just to manage your account, like change your email address.

02:19:28
<transcript>: and update

02:19:31
<transcript>: And update your stripe stuff.

02:19:39
<transcript>: Harry. I was involved with a company called cpa. Grip. Very bad company. The word cpa gave me flashbacks. I'm sorry.

02:19:52
<transcript>: He bought the house with laundered money. I'm really curious what your house looks like, but I don't want you to dox yourself either. It's me League. I've put it all over Twitter. I'm always posting pictures of my house solely acquiring all land in those arcs.

02:20:00
<transcript>: Serious advice. Question time. Oh, here we go. I get so much, I'm going to come over here. I need a break anyway.

02:20:08
nerd_coder: Hey adam, what theme is this.??

02:20:11
<transcript>: Serious advice question time. I get so much concerned about how I should start posting tech YouTube content that I don't post anything, wrote and recorded a script that I think is.

02:20:11
<transcript>: a

02:20:11
itsmeleague: Oh ok, I will go check it out after stream

02:20:24
<transcript>: A going to be a bit cringe and B not that good. Do I just push it out or make it a bit better where I'm not that embarrassed by it, although I always end up making these weirdly funny things, so this may be unsolvable.

02:20:26
<transcript>: I have thoughts.

02:20:26
<transcript>: i

02:20:28
<transcript>: I need to drink water first.

02:20:31
gitpush_gitpaid: @mehulsharmamat push it baby push it

02:20:34
<transcript>: So here's the thing. Mayhew.

02:20:34
<transcript>: i believe

02:20:40
harry_kd: @mehulsharmamat I can read and review it if you 're okay with it. :D I read lots of stufff, lots of stuff. :)

02:20:41
<transcript>: I believe honestly truly believe this in my the depths of my personhood that anybody.

02:20:41
<transcript>: can accomplish

02:20:54
warrenbuffering: #facts

02:20:56
<transcript>: Can accomplish whatever they want. You want to be a youtuber? You can be it. I think everything though, is basically comes down to can you put the reps in? And what I mean is do you have the time and space and mental capacity.

02:20:56
<transcript>: you're not

02:21:00
<transcript>: You're not so overwhelmed with just your job.

02:21:00
<transcript>: or your

02:21:05
<transcript>: Or your current circumstances that you can actually focus and put time into it if you can.

02:21:05
<transcript>: then you just

02:21:25
<transcript>: Then you just put in the reps 100 videos in you'll be getting pretty good at it. I don't think your first video will be good because I don't think your first 20 videos will be good. I'm still in that beginning curve of YouTube videos and I think you're going to make a lot of them and they're going to not be very good. But you're learning and you're getting the reps in. I do. I believe that getting the reps in is so important with anything you want to.

02:21:25
<transcript>: take on

02:21:28
harry_kd: Not me. I suck at public speaking.

02:21:32
gitpush_gitpaid: @mehulsharmamat believe me. im about to deploy my cringe web app. fuck it just do it.

02:21:38
warrenbuffering: 10K hours

02:21:39
<transcript>: Take on, but I know if you want to be a youtuber, you'll put the reps in and if you get excited about it, you need to try. You just need to put some stuff out there, see if the process is enjoyable because you're going to have to enjoy it, or you're never going to get to the part where you're actually making good stuff.

02:21:42
mehulsharmamat: @mehulsharmamat that is true..

02:21:44
<transcript>: That's how I feel, and specifically with YouTube.

02:21:44
<transcript>: i'm

02:21:45
<transcript>: I'm in the same boat.

02:21:49
syrkaz: @mehulsharmamat Best advice I've gotten: you don't have to publish anything you produce. Produce a video like you're gonna post it. If you don't wanna post it, you still learned from it. Most likely, you'll end up posting anyway. You learn either way. :)

02:22:06
<transcript>: I have a real problem with quality. I want everything I do to be as good as possible. So YouTube is a struggle for me because it takes a lot of time to make good, polished video content, especially YouTube, where you need to make it succinct. Get to the point like I can stream here and nobody cares. Like I can go on for 20 minutes right now, and there'll still be some of you here.

02:22:06
<transcript>: listening

02:22:09
<transcript>: Listening. It's pretty low effort, right, but YouTube.

02:22:09
<transcript>: you got to

02:22:13
pbertrand_dev: true nobody cares

02:22:20
itsmeleague: Wow your house is beautiful

02:22:20
<transcript>: You got to nail it down and it has to actually get somewhere quickly, so it's hard. It's a challenge. I don't know if it's for me yet, but I am going to try. I'm going to try and get the reps in. I think we're in a similar position.

02:22:33
nolset: give us that 20 minute ramble about nothing :D

02:22:33
harry_kd: @adamdotdev youre not a beginer. You a pro. All of your videos and stream look better than most Netflix shows. I literally came here from yt and was trying to get all my friends here from different streams.

02:22:35
mehulsharmamat: @Syrkaz that's really good advice actually. I'll make the video (wont even take more than an hour actually) and let's see if i want to put it out.

02:22:35
warrenbuffering: Hit up @flipeditz for editing

02:22:40
<transcript>: It's hard to put stuff out there that you don't feel really proud of. But I think with video creation, especially learning YouTube and what people are looking for, I think you just have to get the reps in. You're going to have to put out a bunch of bad videos to then start making some not so bad videos. And then eventually you're Mr. Beast. That's how it works. Nerd coder. Welcome to my.

02:22:40
<transcript>: chat hey

02:22:46
<transcript>: Chat. Hey, Adam, what theme is this? What theme? Oh, my editor is Dracula.

02:22:52
<transcript>: That is dracula theme. Maleros. Here. What's going on? Matt.

02:22:52
<transcript>: i will go check

02:22:57
<transcript>: I will go check it out after stream. Check out what were we talking about.

02:22:57
gitpush_gitpaid: @ItsMeLeague dont give adam credit. that was all his wife. otherwise the crib would probably just be keyboards and legos

02:23:02
<transcript>: Oh, what my house looks like. Yeah, it's on Twitter. If you just find my Twitter, I post pictures all the time.

02:23:04
dmdboi: This remix is dope

02:23:05
<transcript>: Yeah I love my house.

02:23:07
<transcript>: Push it, baby, push it.

02:23:07
<transcript>: push what

02:23:09
<transcript>: Push? What.

02:23:16
itsmeleague: @gitpush_gitpaid LUL

02:23:17
<transcript>: Push the video. Yes. Just push it. Just accept that you're going to make some bad videos. But the good news is nobody will see them.

02:23:21
mehulsharmamat: that is true tho. I feel like I have the time since even when I do have a job it's 4-6 hrs or less so gives me 8-10hrs on my own.

02:23:21
<transcript>: For the most part when you're starting out on YouTube.

02:23:26
mehulsharmamat: but yeah let's make a bad video let's go

02:23:26
<transcript>: You might go nuts early on a video might pop.

02:23:26
<transcript>: but i think for

02:23:27
feenskee: LUL

02:23:30
<transcript>: But I think for the most part, you're going to get your reps in it's going to take some time.

02:23:41
<transcript>: I can read and review it if you're okay with it. I read lots of stuff. Lots of stuff. There you go. Not me. I suck at public speaking. Oh, you're saying you couldn't be Harry? Well, yeah, I would say.

02:23:43
pbertrand_dev: It is a great house but I dont think I could handle having Adam as a roommate

02:23:54
<transcript>: Like the qualifier is anybody can be anything they want to be. If you don't want to be a youtuber, you're never going to become a youtuber because you're not going to put in all the hard work to be a youtuber. It is a lot of hard work.

02:23:58
<transcript>: It's not just like goofing around with a camera.

02:23:58
<transcript>: it's a lot of hard work

02:24:00
<transcript>: It's a lot of hard work.

02:24:05
<transcript>: It's taxing. It's a lot of creativity and a lot of things you got to put into making video content.

02:24:05
<transcript>: so yeah

02:24:14
<transcript>: So yeah. If you don't want to do it or if you feel like you're bad at it and you don't really care to be it, then you won't. But if you really want to be and you'll get obsessed with it and put in the time.

02:24:14
<transcript>: then yeah

02:24:17
<transcript>: Then yeah. You'll get there.

02:24:17
<transcript>: wow your house

02:24:24
<transcript>: Wow. Your house is beautiful. Thank you so much. It's my League. It's my wife. She has really good taste. She's good at decorating and things like that.

02:24:24
<transcript>: give us that twenty

02:24:30
mehulsharmamat: YTing is TONS of work but it's also really fun. did that failed like 8 times but it's new in tech, feels like in tech you gotta kind provide *some* value atleast

02:24:39
<transcript>: Give us that 20 minutes rainbow, about nothing. Yeah, it's like seinfeld. You're not a beginner. You're a pro. All of your videos in stream look better than most Netflix shows. Whoa. I literally came here from YouTube and was trying to get all my friends here from different streams. That is so kind. Harry.

02:24:48
<transcript>: I think I can make a polished looking video. It's the content that's not so good yet. I haven't figured out how to make something compelling on YouTube, which is.

02:24:48
<transcript>: like something that

02:24:58
<transcript>: Like something that people really want to learn or need to hear or just are curious about. I haven't figured that out yet. Dreos. Thank you for the follow.

02:25:05
<transcript>: That's really good advice. Actually. I'll make the video won't even take more than an hour, actually. And let's see if I want to put it out. Yeah.

02:25:05
<transcript>: you're going to have to get

02:25:08
<transcript>: You're going to have to get the reps in just start accepting.

02:25:08
<transcript>: that

02:25:14
<transcript>: That you're going to put out a lot of stuff you're not really crazy about in order to learn and then eventually.

02:25:14
<transcript>: you're going to start

02:25:25
<transcript>: You're going to start liking it more and more Bone waltz thank you so much. Follow. Warren Says. Hit up Flip. That's right. Flip is the best. I love Flip. Great guy.

02:25:25
<transcript>: tfw

02:25:34
slaxx4u: Get comfortable with being uncomfortable

02:25:35
<transcript>: Tfw on Q thank you for the follow. Let's see. Don't give us Adam credit. That was all his wife. Yeah. Otherwise the crib would probably just be keyboards and legups. It's so true.

02:25:35
<transcript>: hungover

02:25:38
<transcript>: Hungover thank you for the follow.

02:25:42
<transcript>: This remix is dope. Yeah, this song is awesome, isn't it? Let's see.

02:25:56
<transcript>: That is true, though I feel like I have the time since even when I do have a job, it's four to 6 hours or less. So that gives me eight towers on my own. There you go. Oh, if you don't have like a family or obligations yet outside of work, excellent time to get into video because.

02:26:07
<transcript>: Just the more free time you have that's like what I was getting at in terms of like, what can you actually devote time to sustainably without just killing yourself? Because.

02:26:07
<transcript>: you can't

02:26:28
<transcript>: You can't buckle down and like, I'm going to make three videos in two weeks, and it's going to take every bit of me to do it because you're not going to see results in three weeks. You know what I'm saying? It's got to be something you can sustain. You got to be in a pretty good situation where you've just got some built in free time and you've got time to devote to the thing to put in the reps as long as you.

02:26:28
<transcript>: have that

02:26:30
<transcript>: Have that situation like your bills are paid.

02:26:36
<transcript>: You're not stressed for money and you can accomplish your job and your work without.

02:26:36
<transcript>: totally leaving

02:26:39
<transcript>: Totally leaving nothing left in the tank.

02:26:39
<transcript>: then

02:26:42
<transcript>: Then it's great to go pursue those kind of things.

02:26:42
<transcript>: segars

02:26:45
<transcript>: Segarstorm thank you for that. Follow.

02:26:50
<transcript>: Okay, let's make a bad video. Let's go. That's right.

02:26:50
<transcript>: the great house

02:26:58
mehulsharmamat: oh yeah i got all the free time baby -- ill figure out the jobs and things but no responsibilities apart from making sure i eat and dont die

02:26:59
<transcript>: The great house. I don't think I can handle having Adam as a roommate. Yeah, that's the tough part my wife puts up with it. But youtubing is tons of work. But it's also really fun.

02:26:59
<transcript>: did that

02:27:10
<transcript>: Did that failed like eight times. But it's new. In tech. Feels like in tech, you got to kind of provide some value. That's the other thing. Tech videos. It's interesting.

02:27:10
<transcript>: admin jo

02:27:14
<transcript>: Admin jokey. Thank you for that. Follow. It's. Interesting.

02:27:14
<transcript>: like you can

02:27:14
gitpush_gitpaid: @pbertrand_dev would just be triggered by all the larabars wrappers everywhere

02:27:34
<transcript>: Like you can be technical and not make tutorials or not even make tech videos. I mean, if you really want to do YouTube, you might find that like I'm debating, do I want to do tech related stuff at all? Just because I'm a developer doesn't mean I have to make tech related content. And I know I don't want to make tutorials. I just have always felt like it's just not me. I don't know. Tutorials, feel.

02:27:34
<transcript>: like

02:27:54
<transcript>: Like it's hard for me because I don't put a lot of stock, and I just learned a thing. I'm going to share it with people. To me, everything I learned feels like throwaway it's like I'm using this today. I'm using this technology, whatever. I'm building this in, but I don't care. I might use something else next week, and then the next week after that. So putting the time to put together tutorial and be like, here is how you use this thing. I just.

02:27:54
<transcript>: can't

02:27:55
jokestera_e: Teaching people is too much pressure like they expect you to be right

02:28:04
warpple: what are you working on ?

02:28:04
tfwoncue: Tutorials is a super saturated niche I feel

02:28:06
<transcript>: Can't stand that it's not completely evergreen. I can't stand, like making stuff that I feel like in a year, somebody's going to see this video and be like, maybe let astray a little bit because we learn new things. I don't know.

02:28:07
mehulsharmamat: @jokesterA_E yep yep ype.

02:28:08
<transcript>: Sime. Sim. Thank you for the follow.

02:28:12
genejackett: this might be off topic but what should I be studying if I want to be a front end developer?

02:28:25
<transcript>: Get comfortable with being uncomfortable. That's a great thing. All the free time, baby. I'll figure out the jobs and things, but no responsibility is part from making sure I eat and don't die. Just keep yourself alive. Mayhol and start making YouTube videos would just be triggered by all the larbar fabric.

02:28:29
genejackett: I graduate this semester and I'm nervous

02:28:34
<transcript>: That's funny. Teaching people is too much pressure, like they expect you to be right. So I don't mind the idea of teaching people actually junkster.

02:28:36
<transcript>: It's specifically coding tutorials.

02:28:44
<transcript>: I can't get excited about making a coding tutorial. I don't know why I would have made a ton of them by now if I could because it's the natural path.

02:28:44
<transcript>: but

02:28:45
mehulsharmamat: okay got it hopping off stream to edit the vid @adamdotdev salute your advice lets go see ya on the other side

02:28:49
<transcript>: But I don't mind teaching other concepts, like career stuff.

02:28:49
<transcript>: just like

02:28:53
<transcript>: Just like how to sit at a desk all day and do this job.

02:28:54

02:29:29
itsmeleague: I just spat my drink out at your "bare metal is underrated" tweet with the pic of the guy with the wide pants lmao

02:29:30
harry_kd: Hot take: I feel like your type of content will be hot on yt  in few months to years, genuine videos with technical themes instead of hyper energy vids on yt. There was time when your videos would only get 10-100 views, now they are getting at least over 1k and you have stayed true to yourself.  At least, I hope, this content will be popular; your type of content i popular at least for politics niche :D

02:29:40
<transcript>: Tfw welcome to Chat. Tutorials is a super saturated niche. I feel so I think there always going to be new technologies that you can get in early and probably make some tutorials. And there's not a lot of stuff out there like sst. There's not a lot of stuff out there on the ssd front. I think ssd is ascending and amazing. It's a really great framework. Despite dax, I think sst there's not a lot of content.

02:29:40
<transcript>: out there

02:29:46
<transcript>: Out there you could make stuff and probably like that's what I've thought about. Should I make tutorials for building stuff with SST.

02:29:46
<transcript>: there's also

02:29:53
<transcript>: There's also just like once you go past very entry level stuff making tutorials for people who are a little more advanced.

02:29:53
<transcript>: i think that

02:29:55
<transcript>: I think that's a whole nother.

02:29:55
<transcript>: there's always

02:30:01
<transcript>: There's always going to be things niches areas. You could create coding tutorials and get plenty of traction. I'm sure.

02:30:05
<transcript>: Unless gpt takes all of our jobs, I guess.

02:30:14
warrenbuffering: The dev space is so weak for advanced topics

02:30:15
<transcript>: That's the wild card. I just don't know. Jean Jacket. Welcome to Chat. This might be off topic. There is no topic. Don't worry, but what should I be setting if I want to be a front end developer.

02:30:15
<transcript>: so

02:30:16
finitesingularity: Heyoo @adamdotdev, happy Thursday!

02:30:18
<transcript>: So I have a take on this as well.

02:30:18
<transcript>: here's my take

02:30:20
gitpush_gitpaid: @harry_kd especially since his background/history definitely validates his opinion

02:30:24
<transcript>: Here's my take on front end development. I think everybody gets shoved. Like if you're just getting started.

02:30:29
<transcript>: You want to be a friend of development? Are you? Oh, you're graduating.

02:30:29
<transcript>: are you like

02:30:36
<transcript>: Are you like another type of developer now and you want to move into front end or you're saying like you're starting out and you're starting out as a friend and developer. Is that what you're saying? Probably.

02:30:43
<transcript>: One. I think it's strange that as an industry, we shove everyone new into friend and development. I understand why.

02:30:45
<transcript>: I understand.

02:30:47
genejackett: just now starting my career

02:30:52
<transcript>: You get instant feedback. It's nice to build a thing that you can show your friends that kind of stuff.

02:30:52
<transcript>: but

02:30:58
<transcript>: But you can get the same feedback, sort of from building, like a cli or some kind of like terminal tool.

02:31:00
<transcript>: Or like I don't know.

02:31:02
cotrones: my new boss is shoving me into backend and i'm actually thrilled about it

02:31:06
<transcript>: To me, front end is actually really complicated. Maybe so I've done it all.

02:31:06
<transcript>: i've done

02:31:13
<transcript>: I've done front end stuff. I've done a lot of back end stuff, a lot of infrastructure and DevOpsy kind of stuff.

02:31:13
<transcript>: i

harry_kd: @gitpush_gitpaid true dat

02:31:27
<transcript>: I can hear people right now. Devops is a culture. Whatever. I've done a bunch of system level stuff, admin stuff. I've done networking. I worked at the geet Squad, okay? Or the geek Squad. So I've done everything, literally.

02:31:27
<transcript>: front

02:31:30
<transcript>: Front end is one of the more complicated areas.

02:31:30
<transcript>: there's so much

02:31:35
<transcript>: There's so much to take in and it's all moving so fast just to build a simple thing.

02:31:41
<transcript>: You immediately are confronted with three different things. Html, css, and JavaScript.

02:31:41
<transcript>: like you can't just

02:31:43
<transcript>: Like you can't just learn one thing with friend of development.

02:31:52
<transcript>: You're learning also how to make it look. Okay, because you're going to look at it and be like, this looks awful. I'd never want to ship this. So then you have to learn how to make it look nice. And then it's subjective.

02:32:06
<transcript>: And aesthetic and design sense. There's just so many things that could trip you up with front end development. I don't love that. We send everybody into friend development. Sorry. You asked a question. You said what should be setting if I want to get in front development. And then I went on that big tangent.

02:32:12
<transcript>: Everyone always starts with react too. And I feel like learning react right at the gate.

02:32:14
gitpush_gitpaid: "this looks awful i never wanna ship this"... what my parents said when i was born Kappa

02:32:24
cotrones: my favorite path for fronend is the odin project

02:32:25
<transcript>: You're just new a new developer. And somebody's like, so here's, use effect. You're never going to use use effect. If you do, we're going to call you wrong. But here it is. And you need to understand how it works. I hate react so much.

02:32:25
<transcript>: i've

02:32:34
<transcript>: I've done, like, react for a decade, so I'm a little tired of react. What should you study? What should you say? Somebody answer that question. I don't think I can do it. I think I'm too triggered at this point.

02:32:34
<transcript>: i'm sorry

02:32:40
<transcript>: I'm sorry, Jean jacket. That was a terrible answer. Thank you for the follow. Thank you for coming into my chat.

02:32:45
feenskee: SolidJS ftw

02:32:45
<transcript>: Study. Html. Let's start there. That's my answer.

02:32:46
cotrones: https://theodinproject.com

02:32:50
<transcript>: Study how to make like a basic form in HTML.

02:32:50
<transcript>: i don't know

02:32:54
warrenbuffering: Good answer

02:33:07
<transcript>: I don't know. That's probably terrible advice. My advice is probably just don't do front end development. Mayhew got it hopping off stream to edit oh, you're you're hopping off stream. Got it. That's a bid. Salute your advice. Let's go see you on the other side. Sounds good. Mayhew can't wait for that first video nerd coder. Thank you for the follow.

02:33:07
<transcript>: good grandpa

02:33:09
jokestera_e: I know Theo made a video on this talking about getting into web dev today with all the tools available

02:33:11
genejackett: I appreciate your feedback. No this really helps me.

02:33:11
<transcript>: Good grandpa can't wait for Adam to super drive my career. That's right.

02:33:15
<transcript>: Think about running a master class with a master class. No.

02:33:15
<transcript>: set

02:33:18
tfwoncue: I think at first you need to identify why you're interested in frontend. Are you really interested in design? UX? If you'

02:33:19
reddycat333: what cs specialization in a college degree would you recommend?? like machine learning, cybersecurity, etc.

02:33:21
harry_kd: @cotrones that's terrible. imp.  i suggest people to build things they want.

02:33:26
warrenbuffering: HTML and CSS, then you'll naturally end up pulling in JS as you go

02:33:29
<transcript>: Set of ways. Look at fireship, makes tech joke videos, and is wildly successful. It's true. There's a lot of things you can do that aren't tutorials. I just spat my drink out at your bare metal is underrated tweet. The pick of the guy with a wide pants.

02:33:29
<transcript>: i forgot

02:33:31
<transcript>: I forgot about that tweet.

02:33:31
<transcript>: that was a good

02:33:40
<transcript>: That was a good one. I don't have a lot of good ones, so I remember the good ones. Hot. Take. I feel like your type of content will be hot on YouTube in a few months to years.

02:33:40
<transcript>: or genuine

02:33:44
warpple: do u have c++ experience ? im a distrbuted systems dev (c#) wanting to move into c++

02:33:45
<transcript>: Or genuine videos with technical themes instead of hyper Energy vids on YouTube.

02:33:45
<transcript>: there was

02:33:50
<transcript>: There was a time when your videos would only get ten to 100 views. Now they're getting at least over 1000.

02:33:50
<transcript>: and you

02:33:55
cotrones: @harry_kd do you mean my boss shoving me on backend or me suggesting the odin project?

02:34:04
<transcript>: And you have stayed true to yourself. At least I hope this content will all be popular. Your type of content is popular, at least for politics, niche. Interesting, Harry, I just learned something you're saying. The videos I put down on YouTube so far, like just where I'm just kind of talking about stuff.

02:34:04
<transcript>: you're saying

02:34:11
<transcript>: You're saying those are popular in the politics niche. The Dev space is so weak for advanced topics.

02:34:11
<transcript>: it's interesting

02:34:13
<transcript>: It's interesting. Warren.

02:34:20
<transcript>: I don't know. Do senior developers actually use YouTube.

02:34:24
<transcript>: I haven't gone to YouTube to learn something.

02:34:27
<transcript>: In I don't know.

02:34:27
<transcript>: five to

02:34:34
genejackett: ma page

02:34:37
genejackett: man pages*

02:34:47
<transcript>: Five to eight years. It's been a long time, and I would never consider like, I want to learn this. Let's see what YouTube has to say. So I kind of think like, there's a level where you don't need to make content for really senior people because they're not going to get on YouTube and learn that way. Maybe that's just like I'm seeing the world from my little perspective and I'm missing something. But I do think when.

02:34:47
<transcript>: we talk about

02:34:57
<transcript>: We talk about making senior content. I think we mean like mid level, and I'm not trying to be gatekeeping. It's just like I think if you're making senior content.

02:34:57
<transcript>: what are you

02:35:01
nolset: masterclass is a site that has a bunch of videos of people teaching a wide variety of skill levels and audiences. Topics vary wildly and can really be about anything you want.

02:35:01
<transcript>: What are you like, a principal? I don't know. I hate titles.

02:35:01
<transcript>: i've never worked

02:35:02
overra_dev: i've been doing this for 20 years still learning new stuff via youtube

02:35:03
harry_kd: @cotrones dude, you seem like very funny person irl. we should be friends.

02:35:05
<transcript>: I've never worked at a big company, so I don't really know what the titles mean.

02:35:05
<transcript>: hey

02:35:09
overra_dev: but also still junior

02:35:10
warrenbuffering: And I think that's a fair point on YT

02:35:12
<transcript>: Hey. Oh, finite singularities here. Happy Thursday. Thank you so much. How you been? Finite? It's been a while. Sorry. I'm so behind on chat.

02:35:14
jokestera_e: Learning to read docs is a good skill

02:35:16
<transcript>: Let's just try and catch up real quick.

02:35:16
<transcript>: just past our

02:35:21
warpple: i only watch conferences as a midlevel

02:35:27
goodgrandpaa: Can you go into the cli tools and things of that nature? I feel like as a newer dev, you likely don't know what problems there are with development or be able to build a tool that provides some sort of solution.

02:35:31
<transcript>: Just past our career. Okay, Jean jacket. So maybe. I mean, front end is definitely where there's a lot of entry level jobs. Unfortunately, there's forces in the industry that kind of shove you down a certain path. And I don't want to send you down the wrong path. So I just wish people could have a different experience.

02:35:31
<transcript>: with their first

02:35:37
<transcript>: With their first experiences in programming. And I guess if you've been in College, it's not your first experience. So.

02:35:40
gitpush_gitpaid: its weak for advanced topics because 1. most content creators care about content creating and try to funnel new people in 2. advanced people can sniff out bad content 3. advanced content is way more technical

02:35:48
<transcript>: I'm being a little silly here. You've clearly done some programming. You're in College for it. I'm assuming now you want to get into front end development to get an actual job to get paid, which is important.

02:35:54
<transcript>: I hate saying this so bad. I guess learn, react. It's what most jobs are.

02:35:54
<transcript>: it's

02:36:06
survivalguy52: svelte is nice

02:36:14
<transcript>: It's where most of the inertia is in front end world. I don't think it's the future. I think ten years from now, hopefully we're not all writing react still, but probably right now. That's probably the best move for getting started in front end. My new boss is shoving me in the back end. I'm actually thrilled about it. Yeah, no, back end is great. You know what's great. I was a consultant for a couple of years.

02:36:21
<transcript>: Where I only did so used to. I did consulting like front end full stack web stuff. Built the whole thing for people.

02:36:21
<transcript>: and then

02:36:24
<transcript>: And then more recently, I was just more of, like a cloud consultant.

02:36:24
<transcript>: like i did

02:36:30
genejackett: Okay, next, will I need to build a react site first or still work on algorithms?

02:36:31
<transcript>: Like I did security audits, I stood up cloud infrastructure. And when somebody's like, hey, would you come in.

02:36:36
<transcript>: And set up best practices for Security in our aws accounts.

02:36:36
<transcript>: they don't have

02:36:38
<transcript>: They don't have a lot of opinions.

02:36:38
<transcript>: and

02:36:49
tfwoncue: It's simple: advanced topics get less views. Less incentive to create tuts on topics that the algorithm isn't going to push

02:36:57
<transcript>: And obviously, there's an ethical line here where you're not just like, doing anything and doing whatever you want. But I knew I did a good job. And when I deliver and I communicate what I delivered, they're happy you ship a front end to a client, and they suddenly have a lot of opinions. Like, I don't like where that button is. I don't like the UX. We're going to bring in someone who can help with the UX.

02:36:59
cotrones: @harry_kd i'm not sure if that's genuine because i've hardly said anything, but i appreciate it lol we can be friends

02:37:08
<transcript>: Don't do freelance front end development so bad you just never get there. Like the client is just constantly trying to find different ways. They want to change it because it's hard. It is hard.

02:37:08
<transcript>: it's much easier

02:37:12
harry_kd: @adamdotdev I actually write and maintain legacy pascal. I bet there aren't not many developers who hae to suffer like this. :D

02:37:17
csuqac: well said!

02:37:18
<transcript>: It's much easier to design stuff up front and figure out like this is going to work and then build it than it is to do. Like a freelance project anyway. I'm getting way into the weeds.

02:37:33
<transcript>: This looks awful. I never want to ship this what my parents said when I was born. Ouch turk self owned favorite part for front end is the odin Project. What is that? I don't even know what that is. Solid. Js for the win the odin project.

02:37:33
<transcript>: i know

02:37:42
<transcript>: I know theo made a video on this talking about getting into Web dev today with all the tools available. Well, there you go. Go check out theo's video. I'm sure it said things much more coherent than I did.

02:37:49
bcf_ant: https://odin-lang.org/

02:37:52
<transcript>: Gene jacket. I appreciate your feedback. Know, this really helps me. Oh, I'm glad. I think it's first. You need to identify why you're interested in front end. Are you really interested in design? Ux.

02:37:56
jokestera_e: He is really behind lol

02:37:59
bcf_ant: Prime was talking about it today

02:38:01
<transcript>: What cs specialization in College degree would you recommend, like machine learning, cybersecurity, et cetera. So they didn't have specializations when I was in College.

02:38:02
harry_kd: @cotrones you said things I wanted to say. I am not sure it its genuine either. :D

02:38:03
<transcript>: Not that I remember.

02:38:07
dmmulroy: I was a consultant for 3.5 years, if I've learned anything it's that the hardest problems in software engineering are software, it's people and process.

02:38:08
lilfreezi: theres that stud muffin

02:38:08
<transcript>: But those are options. Machine learning, cybersecurity? What other options are there.

02:38:17
<transcript>: Those sound nice. I think people in cybersecurity make a lot of money. I know machine learning, people make a lot of money sound like good ones.

02:38:26
warpple: specialization is mostly masters, undergrad is too broad to specialize

02:38:32
<transcript>: Terrible. I suggest people to build things they want html and css. Then you'll naturally end up pulling in javascript as you go. Do you have C Plus Plus experience? I'm going to shoot you to Systems dev C Sharp wanting to move into C Plus Plus. I do not.

02:38:32
<transcript>: i've never really

02:38:33
mrbankster: clojure

02:38:34
cotrones: @bcf_ant odin project is different than this, it's a path to learning web dev. odin lang seems pretty cool though. the project they build embergen seems very useful

02:38:39
<transcript>: I've never really gone very deep. I've only ever kind of lived at the full stack. Just build a whole thing.

02:38:47
<transcript>: Kind of like indie hacker, but I don't like the term indie hacker because I feel like indie hackers sort of implies terrible quality.

02:38:47
<transcript>: like

02:38:50
jenswoeste: good evening adam & chat. happy bing bang day! LUL

02:38:51
<transcript>: Like when you hear indie hacker, it's like this app is terrible.

02:38:51
<transcript>: it's terrible

02:39:00
<transcript>: It's terrible. You're going to hate using it, but it does something, and you're going to pay me for it. That's what I think of when I think of any hacker, there's just one of me. Don't blame me. It's just one of me.

02:39:02
mehulsharmamat: god damn you just roasted me

02:39:04
bcf_ant: @cotrones thanks for the clarification :)

02:39:09
<transcript>: But that's probably more what I am like. I build things end to end, but I don't go too deep on any one thing. I don't probably have, like, a favorite.

02:39:09
<transcript>: technology

02:39:11
cotrones: np!

02:39:12
csuqac: How easy was it for you to find clients for your solo consulting? And how much did you charge per hour?

02:39:13
<transcript>: Technology or area of the stack to work in just kind of like do it all.

02:39:18
<transcript>: Do you mean my boss shoving me on back end or sister.

02:39:25
nolset: @reddycat333 cyber is a bunch of fun, but the entry level jobs I've heard are very difficult to get into. Starting into general IT and dabbling into cyber is something I've heard is a good way to get into the area. Cyber has a bunch of mid level jobs that need filling but the entry level jobs are saturated rn unfortunately

02:39:26
genejackett: So my college is actually making a new branch Software Engineering - webdev/devops/security Which  is what I wish I could have gone for.

02:39:28
tfwoncue: What headphones are those?

02:39:30
<transcript>: Okay, I got to catch up. I got to catch up. Survival guys. Felt this nice. Welcome to Chat. Yeah. Learn felt solid. Js felt there's a lot of cool things that are alternatives to react now.

02:39:30
<transcript>: i've been doing

02:39:34
<transcript>: I've been doing this for 20 years. Ovara is here.

02:39:34
<transcript>: wait

02:39:35
hungoverxtaco: i could be totally wrong but it always seems like monetarily full stack devs don't get compensated for the work

02:39:35
harry_kd: -- Do not go from c# to cpp. Please. To whoever is asking. If you want to talk to someon working in legacy systems, you can talk to me.

02:39:45
<transcript>: Wait, masterclass is a site that has a bunch of videos of people teaching a wide variety of skills levels and audiences, topics very wildly and can really be about anything you want. Oh, masterclass, like the startup.

02:39:45
<transcript>: like they've got

02:39:53
dmmulroy: @csuqac I was a consultant for https://formidable.com/ and didn't find my own clients fortunately

02:39:56
<transcript>: Like they've got a bunch of famous people that teach stuff on there. Is that what you're talking about? Null set. Sorry. We're having this conversation between a bunch of other messages. It takes me ten minutes to get to your next message. Hope that's not too annoying.

02:40:00
<transcript>: It's like when people used to mail each other and play chess.

02:40:00
<transcript>: they

02:40:05
<transcript>: They mail the next move, and they get it in the mail. Open up the envelope.

02:40:05
<transcript>: and move

02:40:13
oetziofficial: check-mate!

02:40:15
oetziofficial: Kappa

02:40:22
warpple: @harry_kd can u send me a wisp? i asked abt c++

02:40:25
<transcript>: And move that pond two spaces. That's what I feel like we're doing right now. Ovara been doing this for 20 years, still learning new stuff via YouTube. Oh, really? Also still junior. So maybe it's learning style. Zoe vera, maybe some people really do get something out of video. I don't. Which is funny because I spend a lot of time on a camera for somebody who doesn't, like.

02:40:25
<transcript>: to consume

02:40:27
<transcript>: To consume Video content.

02:40:33
nolset: yep! Masterclass is that website thingy. It sounds neat and with your voice and passion, I feel like you'd be really good at it

02:40:34
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't know. I've never thought I learned anything from YouTube. That was just not my style, I guess.

02:40:37
<transcript>: Okay.

02:40:37
<transcript>: i think that

02:40:38
slaxx4u: A better analogy is dial-up

02:40:39
gitpush_gitpaid: anyway, gotta head out. catch yall later

02:40:52
<transcript>: I think that's a fair point on YouTube. Learning to read docs is a good skill. I only watch conferences and mid level. Can you go into the cli, tools and things of that nature? I feel like as a newer dev, you likely don't know what problems there are with development or be able to build a tool that provides some sort of a solution.

02:40:57
<transcript>: Yeah, I guess when I say cli tools, I'm thinking like if.

02:40:57
<transcript>: you're building an

02:41:07
<transcript>: You're building an interface. And you're like building a form. And you're going to learn how when you type something into it and you submit it, it goes to this place. And then you can do something with that data.

02:41:07
<transcript>: i get that

02:41:08
<transcript>: I get that.

02:41:08
<transcript>: i think a lot

02:41:16
iannery: come onnnnn

02:41:18
<transcript>: I think a lot of people are shoved in the front end because you can change the thing and then see it immediately. I change that form. Now it looks different. I think you can do similar things with the cli and.

02:41:18
<transcript>: i guess

02:41:20
<transcript>: I guess I just wish.

02:41:20
<transcript>: every

02:41:22
goodgrandpaa: oh I see!

02:41:24
iannery: one day i'll get it

02:41:36
<transcript>: Every front end, new job, junior role or whatever wasn't front end. I wish we had other types of roles where people could not have to deal with front end nonsense. There's just so much in the front end space that I wish new people didn't have to all learn because it's just a lot.

02:41:36
<transcript>: i am actually

02:41:38
<transcript>: I am actually a monkey. Thank you for the follow.

02:41:41
<transcript>: It's a sentence you don't say every day.

02:41:41
<transcript>: i am actually

02:41:53
goodgrandpaa: I do prefer backend, as well.

02:42:00

nikolaxhristov: Caesar is that you

02:42:05
iamactuallyamonkey: i appreciate u saying my name :D

02:42:05
<transcript>: Only on twitch. It's weak for advanced topics because one most content creators care about content creating and try to funnel new people in. Two advanced people can sniff out bad content. Three advanced content is way more technical. All true. I think that's all true. Okay, next, will I need to build a React site first or still work on algorithms.

02:42:25
<transcript>: Great question, Gene Jacket. So getting a job is a whole skill. And it's a skill I've never had to have. I've always worked for myself. And then I started Startup sammy's, and I still work for myself. And then I left, and I still work for myself like I've just always worked for myself. So I've never had a resume. I've never had a normal job.

02:42:28
<transcript>: So I don't know about the whole.

02:42:28
<transcript>: interview sc

02:42:33
adrnlnjnky: I choose Elixir because it's an emerging language with a growing job market.

02:42:37
iamactuallyamonkey: me too :P

02:42:42
iannery: just got out of a tech interview for senior RN role, wish me luck adam! (wish I get that macbook cuz I'll surely need it)

02:42:44
<transcript>: Interview scene. The leak code impressing people all that stuff, just never had to do it. So I couldn't tell you I don't have a lot of advice for people in terms of polishing the resume and getting ready for the interview. That kind of stuff. I think building a real thing like a react site is probably a good idea.

02:42:44
<transcript>: i think

02:42:47
<transcript>: I think you're going to learn a lot from building a real thing.

02:42:47
<transcript>: and

02:42:49
ptrhvns: Look at job ads. After a while, you'll start to understand what you need to learn.

02:42:54
<transcript>: And that learning will translate even if you don't show the site to anybody that learning should translate into the interview. I would think.

02:42:54
<transcript>: it's simple

02:43:01
lesabotsy: @adamdotdev how does one work  for oneslef though? I'm more interested in that if you don't hirte me?

02:43:02
<transcript>: It's simple. Advanced topics get less views, less incentive to create tutorials on topics that the algorithm isn't going to push makes sense.

02:43:05
warrenbuffering: System Design before LC if you're trying to interview

02:43:13
<transcript>: I actually write and maintain legacy pascal. Wow. I bet there aren't many developers who have to suffer like this.

02:43:17
adrnlnjnky: I thing Building real things is where I have learned SO MUCH

02:43:21
<transcript>: Yeah. I've never done any pascal. Am I even saying it right, pascal? I've read it. I've never said it. Ratably. Thank you for the follow.

02:43:30
<transcript>: Cusec. Welcome to Chat. Well said, bcf ant. Welcome to jat odin lang. It's a language I'm really behind ooh. Okay.

02:43:30
<transcript>: do i need to just

02:43:34
<transcript>: Do I need to just scroll? Should I just scroll into skip stuff.

02:43:34
<transcript>: prime

02:43:37
<transcript>: Prime Time at odin. You said things I want to say.

02:43:37
<transcript>: i was a consult

02:43:37
raidablee: EZ EZ

02:43:39
<transcript>: I was a consultant.

02:43:39
<transcript>: i'm just going

02:43:59
<transcript>: I'm just going fast. Lil Freezey's. Here. There's that submuffin. I always have to read little freezing messages. They're always so complimentary. I love them. One time Lil freezey called me breedable. And dax is uncomfortable about that. But I'm not. I'm not at all. Specialization is mostly Masters. Undergrad is too broad. Just so specialized. Welcome to Chat, Mr. Bankster. Everybody welcome, Mr. Bankster.

02:44:04
<transcript>: Welcome, Mr. Bankster. Closure. What about closure.

02:44:04
<transcript>: okay

02:44:08
mrbankster: hiii

02:44:11
<transcript>: Okay. I'm just going to scroll. I'm going to scroll. Good evening. Yens is here.

02:44:11
<transcript>: happy

02:44:13
<transcript>: Happy Big Bang day.

02:44:16
<transcript>: What is Big Bang day.

02:44:16
goodgrandpaa: What happened to your one favorite viewer that should only say their name? LUL

02:44:28
cotrones: i just want to clarify when i suggested the odin project, it is a free web dev learning path that helped me get my first job. odin-lang is an actual language and seems pretty cool

02:44:29
aisebaxp: You are streaming late now.... (for me), now is overlapping with my other gurus of the programming world....

02:44:34
<transcript>: Is this the anniversary of the Big Bang? Do we actually know that I could be totally wrong? But it always seems like monetarily full stack devs don't get compensated for the work. Great question. However, I don't know for sure, but welcome to Chat. What headphones are those? These are sennheiser HD, six hundred and fifty S. I really got to get back to work. We should probably get back to work.

02:44:41
<transcript>: We should probably get back to work. I'm just seeing if anybody needs to be greeted. Any new chatters.

02:44:49
<transcript>: See a Turk.

02:44:49
<transcript>: that was probably a long

02:44:54
goodgrandpaa: @cotrones Wow, how long did you manage to get your first role in?

02:44:55
<transcript>: That was probably a long time ago. Welcome to Chat, Adrian. Junkie. My first job I got one year ago.

02:44:56
genejackett: adam just want to say keep these streams going. I really like the content and you're helping a lot.   Also where could someone go to meet up with Software Engineers/ CS people in irl. I feel like I've never just run into a CS/SWE which makes networking a bit tough.

02:44:58
nolset: We gotta hit our 20 minute ramble though! It's great just hearing your musings

02:45:01
<transcript>: It's in back end. It's in the back end or it's Int integer back end.

02:45:21
<transcript>: You appreciate me saying your name. No problem. I am actually a monkey. Welcome to my chat. I choose a liquor because there's emerging language of growing job market. Me too. I just got out of a tech interview for Senior React Native Role. Wish me luck, Adam. Good luck, Lanery. Good luck, wish I get that macbook because I'll surely need it.

02:45:24
<transcript>: Okay.

02:45:24
<transcript>: how does

02:45:31
adrnlnjnky: sorry bad typist   in Backend  and its pronounced adrenalinjunky

02:45:34
<transcript>: How does one work for oneself, though I'm more interested in that. If you don't hire me, how does one work for someone? That's a great question. How did I end up working for myself.

02:45:34
<transcript>: i mean some of it is

02:45:44
<transcript>: I mean, some of it is luck. Like somebody found me and gave me a job when I was brand new. A job where I was working from home. I had never worked as a professional software developer.

02:45:44
<transcript>: and it was

02:45:50
<transcript>: And it was off one phone call. And I worked with them for, like, five years. I did full time consulting.

02:46:08
<transcript>: So it's luck. Sometimes you put yourself out there. You decide this is what I'm going to do. I knew I wanted to be a programmer. I had studied in College when I was there, and I had done a little bit of work. I was doing like it work for a company. And I ended up building them some software because I just saw some stuff that could be better.

02:46:08
<transcript>: their processes were pretty

02:46:15
<transcript>: Their processes were pretty inefficient. So I kind of used software there, and it was like I felt confident I could do this for a living.

02:46:15
<transcript>: yeah

02:46:31
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't know. It's probably different for everybody. That's the thing about working for yourself. That's the thing about the side door. Dax calls it the side door. Like everybody's trying to get in the front door. Like putting your application for a job opening. That's the front door. And it's hard.

02:46:45
<transcript>: It's not like you shouldn't try. You should try and try a lot and just keep trying until you eventually get it. But that's the front door. That's where there's a big old line. The side door in life there's a lot of opportunity at the side door. I think I took the side door in life.

02:46:45
<transcript>: it's a different experience

02:46:47
<transcript>: It's a different experience.

02:46:47
<transcript>: but

02:46:49
<transcript>: But it can be really great.

02:46:54
<transcript>: Okay, welcome to Chat ratably? Welcome, welcome.

02:47:01
<transcript>: What happened to your one favorite viewer? That should only say their name. Oh, Kiwi, Where's Kiwi? At? Yeah.

02:47:03
<transcript>: Okay.

02:47:11
goodgrandpaa: Yeah we haven't seen Kiwi in a while!

02:47:16
<transcript>: I'm streaming late. Seba. It's true. I just want to clarify. Katron. Just want to clarify. When I suggested the Odin project, it was a free web Dev learning path that helped me get my first job. Okay. Odin Lang is an actual language. This seems pretty cool. So two different things.

02:47:16
<transcript>: two unrel

02:47:18
<transcript>: Two unrelated things.

02:47:27
<transcript>: Okay. I'm really going to do it. I'm going to come back to work. We haven't seen Kiwi. Actually, I think Kiwi may have showed up yesterday. Just briefly.

02:47:34
goodgrandpaa: Oh cool!

02:47:35
<transcript>: Okay. Now we should have a link to account. Look at it. Look at it. I guess that's not.

02:47:35
<transcript>: the best

02:47:37
<transcript>: The best icon.

02:47:37
<transcript>: i guess

02:47:39
<transcript>: I guess I should find.

02:47:40
raidablee: I'm a cs student and wanted to give back end a try. Currently following a radmap.sh map :)

02:47:43
<transcript>: Let's find the icons. Where do these go.

02:47:46
<transcript>: Where do these go.

02:47:51
<transcript>: What is this called? This file? Is menu links, menu.

02:47:51
<transcript>: links

02:47:52
<transcript>: Links.

02:47:53
raidablee: road* KEKW

02:47:55
cotrones: @GoodGrandPaa i was working as basically help desk at a small non-profit company. i had made friends with the few web dev guys they had. when i had free time i would work on learning web dev and it took me about 6-8 months to get to a point where i felt comfortable applying for a junior web dev role they opened up and they transitioned me over!

02:47:56
<transcript>: Sidebar menu.

02:47:58
<transcript>: Excuse me.

02:47:58
<transcript>: i

02:48:00
<transcript>: Icons.

02:48:02
<transcript>: Here we go.

02:48:02
<transcript>: so

02:48:05
<transcript>: So there's classes.

02:48:07
<transcript>: Icon.

02:48:13
<transcript>: Oh, here we go. Button money, icon.

02:48:13
<transcript>: example

02:48:23
<transcript>: Example. Icon. Home icon. Now we're cooking. That's the one. Okay, so there's files. Svg files. I can do this. I can do this. I can add an icon.

02:48:26
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:48:36
<transcript>: A CS student and wanting to give back in to try currently following a rad map shmap what is that? Oh roadmap.

02:48:36
<transcript>: interesting

02:48:38
<transcript>: Interesting roadmap. Sh.

02:48:43
<transcript>: Ooh, I'm probably going to have to get off here pretty soon and just eat my lunch.

02:48:44
goodgrandpaa: @cotrones Sick! Congrats!

02:48:53
<transcript>: What time is it? I've been doing this for 2 hours, 48 minutes.

02:48:53
<transcript>: maybe i'll just eat while

02:48:56
<transcript>: Maybe I'll just eat while you guys are here. Is that okay with everybody.

02:48:59
<transcript>: The best with this super sensitive microphone.

02:49:04
goodgrandpaa: Of course

02:49:06
goodgrandpaa: Eat up

02:49:08
oetziofficial: im also eating

02:49:10
nolset: ASMR lunch! We don't mind

02:49:12
goodgrandpaa: mukbang!

02:49:22
<transcript>: So these icons, where do these come from.

02:49:30
<transcript>: Asmr lunch. You're here for it. All right, you got it.

02:49:30
<transcript>: my wife

02:49:34
cotrones: @GoodGrandPaa thanks! that was about 3 and a half years ago. the past year i've been working at a fintech startup and it has been a wild learning experience

02:49:34
<transcript>: My wife might be brought me a delicious salad.

02:49:35
mehulsharmamat: @adamdotdev Okay another serious q lol: Just got a twitter reply thing and I'm not that happy with it. Some real bad advice right there by a person, just ignore or peacefully leave my own side of the story?

02:49:38
warrenbuffering: @GoodGrandPaa LUL LUL LUL

02:49:40
<transcript>: And I need to eat it. I'm going to start getting weak.

02:49:52
goodgrandpaa: @warrenbuffering haha

02:49:56
<transcript>: Mayhew.

02:50:08
<transcript>: Just got a Twitter reply thing I'm not that happy with it real bad vice right there by a person just ignore or peacefully leave my own side of story.

02:50:12
<transcript>: I'm not the best person.

02:50:12
<transcript>: to ask

02:50:13
<transcript>: To ask.

02:50:21
<transcript>: I've had some interactions on Twitter lately. I think the internet's getting to us all.

02:50:27
<transcript>: I think the right answer is probably just leave it and just ignore it. But I often respond.

02:50:32
<transcript>: Unfortunately, I don't always respond peacefully. Sometimes I'm snarky.

02:50:34
<transcript>: And it escalates.

02:50:37
<transcript>: So maybe don't listen to me.

02:50:43
<transcript>: Or let me be a lesson it doesn't always go well.

02:50:47
<transcript>: Okay.

02:50:50
<transcript>: I need to make a new icon.

02:50:51
mehulsharmamat: ah god lol Im gonna respond now because it means that much

02:50:55
mehulsharmamat: anyway yeah lol happens ig

02:50:59
<transcript>: What do we have here? Tiktok Twitter Share Podcast IG.

02:51:07
<transcript>: I guess for an account we need like.

02:51:13
<transcript>: I'm just going to leave the icon for now. We'll come back to the icon.

02:51:19
<transcript>: Okay. There is no page for account. I've got to create it.

02:51:20
warrenbuffering: Just tweet the junior, mid, advanced engineer meme with their tweet for mid

02:51:26
<transcript>: If it means a lot to you Mayhew do it respond.

02:51:32
<transcript>: Tweet the junior Mid Advance engineer meme with their Tweet for mid.

02:51:38
<transcript>: Warren, you're so good at this. You're so good at Twitter.

02:51:38
<transcript>: and

02:51:43
<transcript>: Andres, thank you for the follow. Andres. I hope I didn't botch your name.

02:51:43
<transcript>: still no

02:51:45
<transcript>: Still nobody won the MacBook.

02:51:46
warrenbuffering: I loved that meme

02:51:48
<transcript>: Still no winners.

02:51:51
<transcript>: Oetzie's here and eating.

02:51:51
<transcript>: all right

02:51:53
<transcript>: All right? I'm not alone.

02:51:58
<transcript>: It's funny.

02:52:05
warrenbuffering: But it would only let me RT once

02:52:12
<transcript>: Oh, you're talking about the one I did.

02:52:12
<transcript>: i didn't

02:52:13
itsmeleague: Maybe increase the chances for twitch users that have "League" in their name

02:52:19
<transcript>: I didn't like screenshot the Tweet, but I basically put the contents of the Tweet. Is that what you're talking about? Warren.

02:52:20
warrenbuffering: Yeah, yours

02:52:25
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:52:25
<transcript>: i

02:52:27
itsmeleague: Just a sugesstion for it to hit faster

02:52:29
<transcript>: I seem to have a lot of negative interactions with the same people.

02:52:32
warrenbuffering: So funny

02:52:36
<transcript>: I want to say something about that because I don't want to be a negative person on the internet.

02:52:40
<transcript>: But I feel like if you.

02:52:40
<transcript>: as

02:52:41
<transcript>: As.

02:52:44
<transcript>: A Person on the internet.

02:52:44
<transcript>: organ

02:52:46
<transcript>: Organization.

02:52:47
lesabotsy: Scams :) (sorry I miss Dax I need his vibe)

02:53:06
<transcript>: Like react to me has spent the better part of the last eight years convincing me I'm not very smart, I'm not very smart and I don't get it. If I would just get on their intellectual level, I would understand one way data flow and immutability and Redux for pete's sake for pete's sake? Who says for pete's sake? Besides me.

02:53:09
<transcript>: Like if I could just be smart enough.

02:53:09
<transcript>: then react would make

02:53:11
<transcript>: Then react would make would make perfect sense.

02:53:11
<transcript>: you shouldn't use

02:53:14
<transcript>: You shouldn't use use effect.

02:53:14
<transcript>: it's only there for

02:53:18
<transcript>: It's only there for sinking state, you idiot. Like that's how I feel like they've talked to us for eight years.

02:53:18
<transcript>: and then

02:53:19
definiteoptimist: AdamDotDev! I've finally caught a stream, you're a real person thank god

02:53:29
<transcript>: And then when I want to get upset about it, I'm negative. No, I'm upset about it. They're annoying. All the react people are super annoying. I'm sorry. I'm done.

02:53:34
<transcript>: Maybe increase the chances for twitch users that have League in their name.

02:53:34
<transcript>: that

02:53:38
lesabotsy: @adamdotdev what have I told you , shut up you humble breadable human. You are smart.

02:53:40
<transcript>: That's funny. Just a suggestion for it to hit faster. Yeah, the mag Book could go faster.

02:53:43
<transcript>: You missed dax. You had to just bring in scams.

02:53:50
<transcript>: Definite optimist. Welcome to Chat. Wait. You're not new to chat? I finally caught a stream. You're a real person. I am real.

02:53:50
<transcript>: it's true

02:53:52
mrbankster: such a clean desk

02:53:53
<transcript>: It's true. Thank you for the follow definite.

02:54:06
<transcript>: What have I told you? Shut up, you humble bread, breathable, human. You are smart. Oh, did I say I wasn't smart? It's not that I don't think I'm smart. It's that the react people try and make you feel like you're not smart.

02:54:06
<transcript>: subtle an

02:54:09
<transcript>: Subtle anxiety. Thank you for that. Follow your name.

02:54:09
<transcript>: ap

02:54:16
<transcript>: Aptly named. I feel a little bit of it reminded me of the subtle anxiety that I feel. Thank you for the follow.

02:54:16
<transcript>: yeah

02:54:21
<transcript>: Yeah, I guess. Does anyone else feel that way? Am I just alone in feeling like.

02:54:25
<transcript>: The React team has been in an Ivory tower.

02:54:25
<transcript>: some

02:54:27
<transcript>: Some worse than others the whole team.

02:54:27
<transcript>: is not the same

02:54:28
<transcript>: Is not the same.

02:54:34
warrenbuffering: You're not alone, they're incredibly passive

02:54:39
<transcript>: But like trying to convince me that if I could just think in the right way, if I could just think, like, react, all of my problems would be solved. And I would understand.

02:54:42
dmdboi: The trick is not to use React

02:54:43
definiteoptimist: Are you speaking of Dan Abramov?

02:54:50
<transcript>: The true revelation that is react. That's how I feel about react. And it just makes me really mad. It just annoys me to no end. I don't know why I don't get really worked up about much.

02:54:56
<transcript>: But the trick is not to use react. That's what I've been doing lately and it's been fantastic.

02:54:58
<transcript>: Definite.

02:55:03
dmmulroy: The thing that really put me off was the sudden pivot in the last 6 months that we're all using useEffect wrong

02:55:09
<transcript>: I don't want to just call people out specifically. He is on the React team though, and I have retweeted some things and said some things with regards to that person.

02:55:12
iamactuallyamonkey: i was thinking to make my first mvp on react :P now i  am in doubt ..lol

02:55:15
<transcript>: I'm not trying to avoid controversy or.

02:55:15
<transcript>: i feel

02:55:27
oetziofficial: The React team is kinda pushing their idealogies of how the HTML on the browser should be done. Where i am like: "its HTML at the end, so shush" :D

02:55:29
dmmulroy: I loved React when it was class components and it was view = f(state, props)

02:55:30
<transcript>: I feel bad. I don't want to drag individuals. It's just like, it's a whole vibe. When I talk about versel, I'm not talking about specifically. Guillermo. I'm just saying, like, versailles has a vibe, and it's like Evil Empire. I'm sorry. I don't make the rules. It's true.

02:55:34
vatodeharina: i don't like react tbh, always been a fan of Vuejs which one can argue its kinda the same

02:55:40
<transcript>: They're asking for the rebels to come in and overthrow Brcelle. I feel like I just want to see them fail now because they're so pretentious.

02:55:40
definiteoptimist: I think the ivory tower motif is spot on lol

02:55:42
hyeheal: KEKW vercel evil empire

02:55:45
oetziofficial: true vecel has that vibe

02:55:45
<transcript>: And so like, get on my level, just like direct team. They're a match made in heaven. Versaille and react.

02:55:45
<transcript>: those

02:55:51
<transcript>: Those two. Okay. I got to stop. I'm getting so like, I don't want to be negative. I spend so much time.

02:55:51
<transcript>: talking

02:55:56
<transcript>: Talking about this stuff and I don't even use react anymore. I don't care.

02:55:57
dmmulroy: I have taught and trained hundreds of engineers react and hooks made it significantly harder

02:55:58
mehulsharmamat: i love this because this is real

02:56:00
<transcript>: Okay R Haney co think of that. Follow.

02:56:05
<transcript>: Ivory Tower motive is spot on I think so.

02:56:05
<transcript>: i loved rack

02:56:10
definiteoptimist: Everybody love everybody! Come on!

02:56:11
tfwoncue: React people will treat everyone like they're less, while totally over-engineering everything and having the most confusing ecosystem ever

02:56:12
<transcript>: I loved racked when it was classical components. And it was view equals function, state props. Yeah. So view as a function of state.

02:56:12
<transcript>: makes

02:56:14
dnbull: With the RSC explanation I still dont get it.. I guess I'm dumb.

02:56:23
<transcript>: Makes a lot of sense. Components. Thank you. React for ushering in a world where components are mainstream, but also, like, you don't have to use React to use components anymore. They're everywhere.

02:56:23
<transcript>: like every

02:56:27
<transcript>: Like every framework has components, so they don't differentiate in that way anymore.

02:56:32
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't know. All the other stuff would react just. It hurts my head.

02:56:33
warrenbuffering: Are you sure you werent named after basedman?

02:56:39
<transcript>: I was thinking to make my first MVP on React. Now I'm in doubt. Sorry. I'm not trying to.

02:56:39
iannery: I want them to fail but I'm looking forward for vercel sans so much I'm having mixed feelings

02:56:45
iamactuallyamonkey: hahahaa

02:56:48
<transcript>: Sway everybody's technical decisions. It's still the predominant player you should still use React because tons of jobs expect people to know react.

02:56:58
<transcript>: It's still this huge dominant force. So don't listen to me. I think the future maybe belongs to other frameworks. Like ten years from now. I hope.

02:56:58
<transcript>: the landscap

02:57:00
<transcript>: The landscape has changed a bit.

02:57:00
<transcript>: the thing that really

02:57:00
definiteoptimist: ChatGPT can write with whatever front end library you want

02:57:12
iamactuallyamonkey: i m still learning adam . so i wudnt decide anytime soon

02:57:15
<transcript>: The thing that really put me off was a sudden pivot in the last six months that we're all using Use effect drawing. Yeah. I mean, that's one of them then, like, rscs are so complicated that they've got an army of tech influencers trying to explain them to everybody. And still everybody's, like, what.

02:57:15
<transcript>: and

02:57:19
cotrones: at the same time, i would suggest if working with react to really focus on learning javascript itself

02:57:21
hyeheal: If you never worked with React I would not recommend it at this point. Just go with Sveltekit and be the happiest you will ever be

02:57:25
<transcript>: And then you'll get a Tweet. Where, like, somebody who's really smart. We all know they're really smart. Like, I finally get it. And like, that's the problem. We shouldn't have to spend all this time learning your stuff. It shouldn't be that hard.

02:57:25
<transcript>: like what

02:57:28
<transcript>: Like, what is the payoff.

02:57:28
<transcript>: the rectangle is kind

02:57:30
warrenbuffering: Culture doesn't equal language, I personally love the language tbh, hate the culture, love the paradigms

02:57:41
<transcript>: The rectangle is kind of pushing their ideologies of how the html on the browser should be done where I'm like it's html. So shush. That's right. I love your act when it's classic. Oh, we talked about that. I don't like react to be honest. Always been a fan of View, which one can argue is kind of the same.

02:57:44
hyeheal: although React is the best way to get hired atm

02:57:44
<transcript>: Versaille Evil Empire.

02:57:49
dmmulroy: I think RSC makes a lot of assumptions about engineering organizations. I also think this is where Theos take is wrong.  I think basically mandating that we need Node server that can run RSCs is not realistic. So many orgs won't want or do this

02:57:53
<transcript>: I've taught and trained hundreds of engineers. React and hooks made it significantly harder. I totally agree.

02:58:00
<transcript>: I have been guilty of being like, hooks are so cool. I feel so cool that I know how to use hooks, and they just look so clean.

02:58:00
<transcript>: i've definitely

02:58:03
<transcript>: I've definitely fallen into that trap.

02:58:03
<transcript>: but

02:58:11
iannery: RSC is a fucking mistake. The thing is so complicated I see that in my timeline everyday and still don't get it

02:58:14
<transcript>: But so many problems have come about in terms of educating people about react because of hooks. And it's like, do we really gain enough to offset how much confusion, like Use effect is so confusing.

02:58:14
<transcript>: and

02:58:27
<transcript>: And I've done a lot of React development. I've done, like, eight years of React development. If I still struggle with it, then there's no hope. Okay. Bald, bearded builder. Thank you for that. Follow.

02:58:27
<transcript>: i love

02:58:31
<transcript>: I love this because it is real well.

02:58:36
<transcript>: I try to be real every day I don't have any reason not to be.

02:58:36
<transcript>: i get

02:58:37
gabrielmodog: I made 5 years of React dev, I so tired too

02:58:45
<transcript>: I get on here. Nobody pays me to do this. I don't get paid to stream. I don't get paid to say anything. I have no sponsors.

02:58:45
<transcript>: i have no

02:58:52
oetziofficial: @Iannery it feels like PHP :/

02:58:57
dnbull: If people are confused by RSC, I don't know how it will "succeed"

02:59:04
<transcript>: I have no vested interest in any frameworks. I'm not an open source maintainer. I've made a lot of money and I work on my own startup, and I don't care. I just don't care. At this point in my career, I'm just going to say what I think and I don't want to be negative all the time. But I think sometimes it's healthy. I guess that's what I'm getting at. Okay. I'm done.

02:59:04
<transcript>: everybody

reddycat333: slay

02:59:27
<transcript>: Rack. People will treat everyone like they're less while totally over engineering everything and having the most confusing ecosystem ever. That is definitely how I feel with the rsc explanation. I still don't get it. I guess I'm done me too. Dmbo we can just be dumb together. Are you sure you weren't named after Bass Man? Ooh, good one, Warren. I want them to fail, but I'm looking forward to versailles Sands for versailles Sands? So much. Oh, the.

02:59:34
<transcript>: i'm still

02:59:41
<transcript>: I'm still learning Adam, so I wouldn't decide anytime soon. Yeah. No, I think there's lots of stuff to explore. React is not the only game in town.

02:59:50

02:59:51
<transcript>: And.

02:59:53
<transcript>: Chile.

02:59:53
<transcript>: at the same time

03:00:13
<transcript>: At the same time, I would suggest if working with React to really focus on learning javascript itself. If you've never worked, I'm way behind. If you never worked with React, I would not recommend it at this point. Just go with Felt Kit and be the happiest you'll ever be. There you go. Culture doesn't equal language. I personally love the language. To be honest, hate the culture. Love the paradigms. Yeah, that's totally fair. Warren. React from like a technical standpoint.

03:00:13
<transcript>: eco

03:00:26
<transcript>: Ecosystem standpoint. It doesn't deserve everything I'm throwing at it right now. It's not react fault. It's the culture. It's the same thing with versailles. I love Brazil as a product. Fantastic. I could do without the pretentious marketing, like I could do without the.

03:00:39
<transcript>: Like where Apple? If Apple did front end hosting, that just it gets on my nerves. I just anytime somebody puffs themselves up like that. I just want to shoot it down. Maybe that's just bad of me. And I should have sinned to some better level. Where.

03:00:39
<transcript>: i'm like

03:00:46
<transcript>: I'm like, just let it blow right past me, and I ignore it. But I'm not. I'm a human, and it bothers me.

03:00:54
<transcript>: Although React is the best way to get hired at the moment, yeah, I believe that's probably true. I think rsc makes a lot of assumptions about engineering organizations.

03:01:02
<transcript>: I also think this is where theo's take is wrong. I think basically mandating that we need node server that can run rscs is not realistic.

03:01:07
<transcript>: I'll be honest. I don't know, theo's. Take.

03:01:21
nikolaxhristov: RSCs on Cloudflare Workers?

03:01:24
<transcript>: I don't know enough about rscs because I've not spent five minutes reading about them because as soon as it was like, there's a new thing to learn, and it's really hard to learn. And it was coming from the react people. I'm out. I'm totally out. Sorry I've done that too many times in my career.

03:01:24
<transcript>: i'm

03:01:34
<transcript>: I'm out. No, thanks. Rc is a mistake. This thing is so complicated. I see that in my timeline every day, and I still don't get it. I made five years of reactive. I was so tired, too. Yeah. When you've done it for years and years.

03:01:34
<transcript>: eventually

03:01:36
<transcript>: Eventually you get tired.

03:01:40
<transcript>: Okay.

03:01:45
<transcript>: I'm going to just move on.

03:01:52

03:01:52
<transcript>: okay

03:01:54
<transcript>: Okay, what are we doing.

03:01:54
<transcript>: i don't know

03:02:01
<transcript>: I don't know. Am I doing anything? People, listen, let's do this. People with some Tweets in my timeline. Oh, no.

03:02:08
<transcript>: This is what you guys put in my timeline. I have to look at pictures of dax in Miami.

03:02:12
<transcript>: This is what's going on right now. These are the tweets you want me to read.

03:02:12
<transcript>: okay

03:02:14
<transcript>: Okay, I guess.

03:02:14
<transcript>: cut my head shaving but

03:02:19
<transcript>: Cut my head shaving, but I'll go day one, react my cars. I'm not fomoed at all. Okay.

03:02:22
<transcript>: I'm sure they're having a terrible time.

03:02:27
definiteoptimist: Damn this shots are so hawt, I love this stream quality

03:02:28
dmmulroy: My understanding is that RSCs are components that basically initially run on the server to generate jsx, and then on subsequent rerenders makes fetches to the server and runs itself again and streams the changed html back and updates the dom

03:02:31
<transcript>: Doesn't that look like somebody who belongs in Miami? I never realized it, but he's so made for Miami.

03:02:37
<transcript>: Definite optimist. Thank you so much. I put a lot of time into the stream.

03:02:39

iamactuallyamonkey: he looks like the bald version of me :D

03:02:58
<transcript>: I put a lot of time in and now it just gets enjoy using it all day. My understanding is that rscs are components that basically initially run on the server, generate jsx, and then on subsequent rerenders makes fetches the server and runs itself again. Streams of changed html back and updates the dom. That's simple enough to understand. I guess I understand that GTA.

03:02:59
hyeheal: can we do an Anti-React conference?

03:02:59
<transcript>: Character.

03:03:05

03:03:08

03:03:17

03:03:45

03:03:47
<transcript>: That's a spicy tweet.

03:03:53
warrenbuffering: That's bait

03:03:55
<transcript>: I don't have a take. I just don't you know most things when it comes to.

03:04:00
mrbankster: this isn't 2019

03:04:15
<transcript>: Like that's bait. Yeah. Most things when it comes to like politics, that's not politics, but just like human interest topics. I just don't have takes. I've just been so sheltered here in my little, like corner of the world. And it's not that I'm bowing out of having a take. I just literally have never thought about it. Not for 5 seconds. So when someone.

03:04:15
<transcript>: 's like

03:04:33
<transcript>: 's like, what is your take on hot political issue? I'm like, I don't know, don't care. I haven't thought about it. I just like to write code like, that's just what I like to do. And I know some people said to cop out, you should have stances, but who has time to have stances on all this stuff or keep up with any of it? I hope that Earth doesn't burn up, like, I really do. I'm doing my part.

03:04:33
<transcript>: solar

03:04:36
<transcript>: Solar the stream is all powered by the Sun.

03:04:36
<transcript>: okay i'm

03:04:46
mrbankster: people get mad if you dont vote

03:04:49
goodgrandpaa: Do you have a tesla?!

03:04:50
mrbankster: its dumb

03:04:50
itsmeleague: You are living ly dream life lol

03:04:54
<transcript>: But, like, I don't know, I've benefited from the current system, so I don't have a lot of complaints. I understand that people do. And I want to be an advocate for those who do. But I feel like I'm just saying words when I say that now. In fact, I'm just saying that. And what does it mean.

03:04:54
<transcript>: see don't agree

03:04:56
iannery: @dmmulroy the thing is that is trivial to understand. The thing that makes me grind my gears is how to interact with client components back and forth and the whole prop drilling avoidance happening in dan's recent tweets.

03:04:58
goodgrandpaa: @ItsMeLeague Same lmao.

03:05:02
<transcript>: See, don't agree. I don't know. I just don't think about this stuff very much. Basically, if it doesn't have to do with technology or my family, I just probably haven't thought about it.

03:05:05
<transcript>: Friends P thank you for the follow.

03:05:08
aintnowayyyyyyyy: goofy ah

03:05:15
<transcript>: Do you have a Tesla? I do. Good, grandpa. People get mad if you don't vote, so I vote. I do. This isn't 2019. Yeah.

03:05:20
goodgrandpaa: Please tell me it's the s plaid?!

03:05:26
jokestera_e: Votes in the Ozark count?

03:05:31
<transcript>: I do vote for what it's worth. I don't have a lot of strong opinions about what I'm voting on. And sometimes I feel like it's a waste of time because I just feel like, Is anything ever going to change? Are the two parties in America any different? If you vote for a third party, you just throw in your vote away. And then people are like, no, you're not. You got to do that eventually.

03:05:31
<transcript>: it'll

03:05:34
<transcript>: It'll something I don't know you just can't win.

03:05:34
<transcript>: you can't

03:05:36
<transcript>: You can't win.

03:05:42
<transcript>: This stream has taken a very negative turn. Is this what I get when I stream in the afternoon? I just get very cynical.

03:05:45
goodgrandpaa: Adam green party confirmed Pog

03:05:45
oetziofficial: the issue with not having the clue of whats happening is fine, but purposely not giving a thought on topics, is kinda worse than ignoring the topic and moving on. (sorry, not sorry)

03:05:45
<transcript>: my dream

03:05:48
<transcript>: My dream life really.

03:05:48
nikolaxhristov: @jokesterA_E not if you own the city council like Adam

03:05:53
<transcript>: The thing is that it is trivial to understand.

03:06:01
washedlih: have u seen the spacex launch today\

03:06:03
itsmeleague: I wouldnt want to vote for anyone above the age of 75 personally

03:06:05
<transcript>: The thing that makes me grind my gears is how to interact with client compose back and forth and the whole prop drilling avoidance happening in dan's recent tweets. So we're back and forth between the react drama and.

03:06:08
<transcript>: Geopolitical and social issues.

03:06:15
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Ain't no way Goofy, Goofy. Did I say something goofy.

03:06:17
warrenbuffering: I shouldn't have brought up React, that's my b. I just liked the meme

03:06:21
<transcript>: What was goofy? Please tell me it's the S. Plaid. No. Good. Grandpa.

03:06:21
<transcript>: we owned

03:06:27
definiteoptimist: Let's go positive and stop talking about frameworks. What are your favorite set pieces behind you?

03:06:32
<transcript>: We owned an S back in like ten years ago. Chinton, thank you for that. Follow chinton 420. I wonder if your name has to do with the date it's currently 420.

03:06:42
goodgrandpaa: Mannn I want the S Plaid, it's my dreamcar ngl

03:06:43
<transcript>: So we had an S. We traded in for an X. We drive a Model X. Now we've got two boys. It's really easy to get them in the back because the doors do that thing. Votes in the ozarks count. Not really.

03:06:43
<transcript>: adam green

03:06:45
<transcript>: Adam Green Party confirmed.

03:06:49
goodgrandpaa: It makes sense with children for sure!

03:07:00
<transcript>: The issue with not having the clue of what's happening is fine, but purposely not giving a thought on topics is kind of worse than ignoring the topic and moving on. Sorry, not sorry. Oh, no, I totally get it. Ott. So let me just clarify. Actually, let me just come over here because I can read better when I come over here.

03:07:04
<transcript>: So let's see you're saying.

03:07:04
<transcript>: it's worth

03:07:12
<transcript>: It's worth it. Ignoring it is by purposely not giving a thought. I don't think I purposely don't give thoughts.

03:07:12
<transcript>: it's just

03:07:14
<transcript>: It's just like.

03:07:14
<transcript>: at what point am i

03:07:34
<transcript>: At what point am I day? Would I sit and think about some of these things that I see people get really worked up about. And granted, it's not a me and I feel very privileged and like, this is all wreaking of just like, sure, white guy who's never had an issue in his life doesn't understand what the big problem is. It's not that I understand people being upset with the way things are.

03:07:39
<transcript>: Things suck. I get it. I just mean, like when some specific issue comes up.

03:07:39
<transcript>: and

03:07:44
aintnowayyyyyyyy: goofy ahh take üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•

03:07:55
warrenbuffering: live and let live, dawg

03:07:56
<transcript>: And people want to know your take it's like I don't have takes on most things. I just don't. And it's because I've literally not set and thought about them. But it's not like I'm trying not to I just like, when would I think about it? What would like happen in my day where it's like, I should think about what I think about that. Does that make sense.

03:07:56
<transcript>: roma the develop

03:07:57
oetziofficial: ok, i understand

03:08:02
<transcript>: Roma, the developer. Thank you so much for the follow. I don't know. I'm probably ignorant. I'm probably wrong. Here. Listen, let's see.

03:08:02
<transcript>: i find

03:08:11
oetziofficial: its not obligatory to share any state of yours

03:08:12
aintnowayyyyyyyy: jus let it go

03:08:13
oetziofficial: all good!

03:08:22
<transcript>: I find most often I'm wrong, and I have to learn something new. But I do like the idea of just holding things loosely and being ready to change my mind. I am totally ready to change my mind. I should probably spend more time thinking about issues that bother other people or issues that affect other people because there's other people in the world that's me. Turns out not if you own the city Council, like Adam.

03:08:22
mehulsharmamat: tweeted the thing i wanted to tweet -- i do not feel good creating more unnecessary negative internet text but it feels relaxive

03:08:26
<transcript>: Have you seen the spacex Watch today? I have not washed.

03:08:26
<transcript>: i have not

03:08:33
<transcript>: I have not another thing I haven't spent a second thinking about is our space exploration exploration. It's a hardware.

03:08:46
<transcript>: I wouldn't want to vote for anyone above the age of 75 personally. Yeah. I have a take on that. I think everyone in US politics is too old. I mean, not too old, just like I think we do have an issue with.

03:08:49
mr_yan19: You do you.  I enjoy the stream.  Lots of hot take streams if you want that. beginApecoin

03:08:50
<transcript>: People not being connected to the real world, probably.

03:08:50
<transcript>: i

03:09:02
<transcript>: I don't know should they be the ones voting I don't know here's a take this is going to sound dumb and naive and dizz but here's a take why don't we with technologies today why don't we just have.

03:09:02
<transcript>: an actual

03:09:05
<transcript>: An actual like everybody votes for everything.

03:09:05
<transcript>: do we need

03:09:15
<transcript>: Do we need representatives anymore? Like couldn't everybody just have a smartphone app that's like tied to their identity, somehow, biological or something? And we can all just vote on every single thing we care about.

03:09:15
<transcript>: do we need rep

03:09:17
romathedeveloper: honestly I never voted either and I'm African American, I feel like its up too you where your life goes anything I was able too accomplish was on my own

03:09:20
nikolaxhristov: money

03:09:21
<transcript>: Do we need representatives? I don't know. There's my take. This is such a bad take.

03:09:21
<transcript>: like

03:09:21
hyeheal: direct democracy

03:09:24

03:09:26
oetziofficial: in switzerland they can call for that

03:09:31
<transcript>: Shouldn't have brought up react. That's my bad. No, you're good. Like the meme. No react. You're good. I always like talking about react. Clearly.

03:09:32

<transcript>: Let's see, man. I want the s plaid. It's my dream card. Not going to lie. It makes sense with children for sure. Yeah. We had an S. And it was before they had the plaids. But we had this when we had our first child. We brought him home from the hospital. It was really hard to get him in and out of the car. And we're like, this isn't going to work.

03:10:17
<transcript>: let's see

03:10:18
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:10:29
senior_ori: but do you really want the possibility of anyone to vote?

03:10:39
<transcript>: Goofy take oh, got you ain't no way just let it go, okay? Live and let live dog. Okay, I understand. It's not obligatory to share any state of yours. All good to share any state. Oh, tweeted thing. What was I not letting go? No, I need to learn from this. There's something I wasn.

03:10:39
<transcript>: 't letting go

03:10:53
<transcript>: 't letting go. Can you guys re explain to me what we were talking about? Then I get so behind on chat and I don't know what's going on. Tweeted the thing I wanted to tweet. I do not feel good creating more unnecessary, negative internet text, but it feels relaxive. Yeah, I do that too.

03:10:53
<transcript>: phantom

03:11:01
<transcript>: Phantom. Wait, I already saw that one. Did I see that one fandom. Thanks anyway, thanks again for the follow. Even if I already said it.

03:11:02
dmmulroy: Rank choice voting instead of first past the post would make a huge difference in who our representatives are

03:11:06
<transcript>: Udu. I enjoy the stream. Lots of hot take streams if you want that.

03:11:24
<transcript>: What was I talking about? I must have said something really spicy, because you guys were all kind of like, on edge, a little bit romo. Welcome to Chat. Honestly, I never voted either. And I'm African American. I feel like it's up to you where your life goes. Anything I was able to accomplish was on my own. So I do vote.

03:11:28
<transcript>: I vote. I just don't know how much I feel like it matters.

<transcript>: i know people

03:11:33
<transcript>: I know people get really upset when you're like, I don't know. Does voting even matter? Of course it matters. There's only thing we have.

03:11:33
<transcript>: but

03:11:36
<transcript>: But I don't know. Realistically.

03:11:36
<transcript>: i know

03:11:39
<transcript>: I know who's going to get elected in my area.

03:11:39
<transcript>: and

03:11:42
<transcript>: And I just don't know how much it matters.

03:11:46
<transcript>: Is that just giving up, though? That's probably just giving up.

03:11:46
<transcript>: money

03:11:47
<transcript>: Money.

<transcript>: direct

03:11:48
oetziofficial: re-explaining: if someone asks you for your state on topic X, you dont need to share it in public, but I would appriciate if you think about topic X.

03:11:49
<transcript>: Direct democracy.

03:11:52
oetziofficial: makes sense?

03:11:54
<transcript>: Sortition for the win. I don't know what these things are biological app binding.

03:11:54
<transcript>: is that not

03:11:57
<transcript>: Is that not actually possible in Switzerland.

03:12:07
<transcript>: They can call for that. Really? I think crypto bros are trying to make that take a reality. Oh, boy, I don't want to associate with them. Stop trying to ruin gerrymandering.

iannery: any thoughts on onboardbase? I just made an account to try it and got like 25 emails of suspicious access to my account -- and to complete the mess I cannot delete my account through their site. GDPR sent their regards.

03:12:22
<transcript>: I like the concept of magis, like in neon genesis AI government, but with talk good alignment. Interesting. Never heard of any of that. Welcome to Chat, Senior or E, but do you really want the possibility of anyone to vote.

03:12:25
amanharwara: sortition is just basically selection by lottery lmao

03:12:25
<transcript>: Possibility of anyone to vote? What do you mean.

03:12:31
<transcript>: Gf vault thank you for the follow. What do you mean? The possibility of any one to vote senior.

03:12:31
<transcript>: senior

<transcript>: ranke

03:12:36
<transcript>: Ranked choice voting instead of first pass the post.

03:12:36
<transcript>: would make

03:12:44
<transcript>: Would make a huge difference in who our representatives are. Interesting. Yeah. I would love to see some changes fundamentally. Shake it all up.

03:12:44
<transcript>: it's all kind of

03:12:47
<transcript>: It's all kind of broken? Just like shake it all up.

03:12:47
<transcript>: let's

03:12:50
<transcript>: Let's put in some new rules.

03:12:50
<transcript>: something

03:12:51
<transcript>: Something.

03:12:53
<transcript>: Let's just like I don't know.

03:12:53
<transcript>: let's just

03:12:58
<transcript>: Let's just reset throw them all out. Let's reelect everybody they probably wouldn't change anything.

03:13:14
<transcript>: Re explaining if someone asks you for your state of on Topic X, you don't need to share it in public. But I would appreciate if you think about Topic X. Makes sense. No, it totally makes sense. So you're saying, like, I don't have to respond. But you would appreciate if I think about it just in private.

romathedeveloper: how do you feel about Django as a framework for frontend beginner ? I only have backend experience with C++

03:13:30
<transcript>: Base. I don't know what that is. I just made an account to try it and got like 25 emails of suspicious access to my account.

03:13:30
<transcript>: to complete the mess

03:13:33
<transcript>: To complete the mess. I don't know what onboard base is.

03:13:33

<transcript>: titian

03:13:54
<transcript>: Titian is just basically selection by lottery. Oh, interesting. Does that work for people who's figured it out in the world, what governments like, figured it out, or what society is there like a group that's living their best life right now and we could all just copy, how do you feel about django as a framework for friend and beginner? I only have back end experience with C.

03:13:54
<transcript>: plus plus

mehulsharmamat: i think humans overestimate how good they are

03:14:05
<transcript>: Jango is one of those frameworks that I wish we had in the javascript land where everything's included and it's just easy to work with.

03:14:05
<transcript>: sounds good

03:14:11
iannery: onboardbase.com, a way to make secret keys management between accounts

03:14:11
<transcript>: Sounds good. I think humans overestimate how good they are. I believe that too.

hyeheal: You would not believe me if I said the US is probably still the best place to live

03:14:17
<transcript>: I got to think about it for a minute.

03:14:24
<transcript>: But I think there's probably something there. I think I don't spend enough time thinking. I think I lack a lot of self awareness.

03:14:32
senior_ori: probably people that are less smarter will manipulate much easier and will be much more united, cos of that we are where we are.

03:14:33
<transcript>: And I just don't spend enough time thinking. It's basically like 15 minutes every night in the shower. That's the only time in the day when I'm not.

03:14:33
<transcript>: talking consum

03:14:35
oetziofficial: swiss people live a very high end point of view. they have less issues (politically)

03:14:37
<transcript>: Talking. Consuming. You know what I mean? Don't do enough thinking.

03:14:40
<transcript>: New Zealand seems pretty nice.

03:14:44
<transcript>: You would not believe me if I said the US is probably still the best place to live.

03:14:44
<transcript>: i mean i

03:14:51
<transcript>: I mean, I don't not believe you. I don't really know. I've never lived anywhere else, so I don't have anything to compare it to.

03:14:51
<transcript>: probably people

03:14:54
jokestera_e: Are stilling doing the gym in the am?

03:14:56
<transcript>: Probably people that are less smarter will manipulate much easier and will be much more United.

03:14:56
<transcript>: because of

03:15:00
<transcript>: Because of what we are where we are.

03:15:05
dmdboi: Americans say US is best place to live, Europeans say literally anywhere else is better LUL

03:15:08
<transcript>: Senior you said earlier something and that's tying that together. Do you really want the possibility of anyone to vote.

03:15:08
<transcript>: and then

03:15:19
<transcript>: And then your follow up was probably people that are less smarter will manipulate much easier and will be much more United because that's where we are. I don't know that I fully understand senior.

03:15:19
<transcript>: i

03:15:24
hungoverxtaco: @senior_ori i think once you exclude people from voting you start a dangerous path like eugenics

03:15:32
<transcript>: I think everyone who's over 18 should be able to vote or 21. When is it 1818? Everyone over 18 should build a vote. I have no problems with everyone being able to vote no matter how smart they are or not smart they are who's to say what smart is. I don't know.

03:15:41

03:15:46
<transcript>: Just the one time I puffed it up in my mind it wasn't as good as I thought it'd be.

03:15:46
<transcript>: swiss

03:15:46
iannery: @hungoverxtaco yup, i agree

03:15:51
<transcript>: Swiss people live at a very high end point of view. They have less issues politically.

03:15:55
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah. They're the ones that stay out of everything.

03:15:55
<transcript>: they just

03:16:00
<transcript>: They just avoid all wars and all conflicts. And they're like, we're good, just leave us alone.

03:16:01
warrenbuffering: I have a political meme Im gonna post and need you to know I made it before this stream. Not a subtweet

03:16:06
<transcript>: Americans say US is best place to live. Europeans say literally anywhere else is better.

03:16:18
<transcript>: Think once you exclude people from voting, you start a dangerous path like eugenics. Yeah, I'm not in favor of stopping people from voting. I think everybody should get to vote.

03:16:20
amanharwara: i reckon it would probably be better if geriatrics weren't allowed to be in politics

03:16:21
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't.

03:16:21
<transcript>: i guess

03:16:24
<transcript>: I guess that's my opinion on that.

03:16:27
<transcript>: Kind of want to visit SF seems like that social network.

03:16:27
<transcript>: networks mov

03:16:30
dmdboi: I'd let only the people who want me in power to vote

03:16:31
<transcript>: Networks. Movies Dream I'm from India. For context.

03:16:31
<transcript>: i

03:16:34
<transcript>: I have not enjoyed all of my time in SF.

03:16:34
<transcript>: there are some

03:16:44
<transcript>: There are some wonderful vegan pop tarts there at the Ferry Building. Other than that, it's kind of dirty, not my favorite. I just don't like cities. I'm like I live in the Woods.

03:16:48
<transcript>: And would have to deal with a lot of the same things people in the city deal with.

03:17:00
<transcript>: Let's see. I have a political meme. I'm going to post and need you to know I made it before the stream. Not a swed tweet. No, you're good. So here's what I should say before you post it. And before it sounds like I'm just responding to your tweet.

03:17:00
<transcript>: don't listen

03:17:02
mehulsharmamat: I prefer woods. Maybe i just like dreaming about cities than actually living in them

03:17:02
<transcript>: Don't listen to me.

03:17:22
romathedeveloper: your like a mad scientist I love it

03:17:22
<transcript>: I have no reason to be offering up good takes on any of this. My takes aren't good. I'm just like a very secluded man in the ozarks who has very few opinions on most anything that's not technology. Even my opinions on technology. Just don't listen to me. Just ignore me. Why are you all listening to me? Let's get back to doing stuff. Actually, maybe I should be done today. Should I.

03:17:22
<transcript>: be done today

03:17:26
<transcript>: Be done today. I feel like this afternoon stream has taken a strange turn.

03:17:26
mehulsharmamat: Adam before giving advice: Don't listen to my advice   gives generally good advice

03:17:30
warrenbuffering: Haha perf. Might be a bit, it's only 97% there

03:17:32
goodgrandpaa: @mehulsharmamat I know that feeling. I want to live in NYC, but I've never lived in an actual city. Although I prefer being able to walk everywhere.

03:17:32
<transcript>: I normally stream in the mornings bright and early when you all are asleep. Probably.

03:17:34
genejackett: I find it very interesting that most streamers that are in software live off the grid lol or at least the few i've seen

03:17:35
oetziofficial: oh, thats no more - switzerland did plenty in the past 5-7 years. they try to share to the public that they stay out of war and stuff, but thy did some stuff on the recent things

03:17:36
goodgrandpaa: but adam, we love your streams!

03:17:38
definiteoptimist: Go take a nap Adam!

03:17:39
<transcript>: And somehow I got to talk about politics. And I don't even know anything about politics. I literally know nothing. But I'm going to think about it more.

03:17:39
<transcript>: because

03:17:44
<transcript>: Because I feel like I should and Oetzie said I should and I believe that's otsy.

03:17:51
<transcript>: I reckon it would probably be better if geriatrics weren't allowed to be in politics.

03:17:51
definiteoptimist: Your early stream shows why I never see you on, I'll try to wake up more early!

03:18:05
<transcript>: I let the only people, or I'd let only the people who want me in power to vote. I prefer Woods. Maybe I just, like, dreaming about cities than actually living in them. You're like a mad scientist. I love it. Me. I'm like a mad scientist. Is the hair. My hair is kind of crazy today.

03:18:13
oetziofficial: dont listen to me lol, listen to your heart sir!!!

03:18:17
<transcript>: Might be a bit. It's only 97% there. Oh.

03:18:22
<transcript>: Your means not fully done. You're still forming it based on what I'm saying.

03:18:27
<transcript>: Like this idiot. I know that feeling. I want to live in New York city.

03:18:27

jenswoeste: mad scientist? maybe not scientist LUL

03:18:47
<transcript>: Find it very interesting that most streamers that are in software live off the grid, or at least a few I've seen. Yeah, I guess prime lives on a ranch. I live in the ozark Woods, the mountains in ozark and the ozark Hills. Oh, that's no more. Switzerland did plenty in the past five to seven years. They try to share it to the public. They stay out of war and stuff. But they did do some stuff on the recent things. Okay.

03:18:50
warrenbuffering: Account

03:18:59
<transcript>: Go take a nap. I think I need a nap. Early stream shows why I never see you on. I'll try to wake up more early. Don't go. The most fun of all you eyes is calling your name. I do have some more work to do, so I guess I could stay on the stream for a little bit longer.

03:18:59
<transcript>: i just

03:19:11
<transcript>: I just feel like I should stop talking about politics because I just really, honestly don't have thoughts code greater than politics. I agree. Don't listen to me. Listen to your heart, sir. Yeah. No. Let's see. I think you're right.

03:19:11
<transcript>: i think ult

03:19:13
<transcript>: I think ultimately.

03:19:15
goodgrandpaa: Maybe ignore chat for a while :P

03:19:22

harry_kd: @adamdotdev from yt comments to twitch chat. I have met at least 5 people who I appreciate very much.  Your charm helps me make friend and motivates me. TYSM adamn for streaming even though you don't have to. It means a lot to me. :)

03:19:33
<transcript>: It's a place of privilege to be able to say, like, I don't have opinions on all these things that affect people a lot like other people's. Reality is very different from mine. And there's a reason they care about some of these issues. And for me to just be like, flippantly, like, I never even thought about it. That's just a very obnoxious thing to say. And I hear it.

03:19:33
<transcript>: now

03:19:34
<transcript>: Now.

03:19:34
<transcript>: but

03:19:39
<transcript>: But the thing that I do pride myself in is that the right word.

03:19:39
<transcript>: i don't hold on to

03:19:45
<transcript>: I don't hold on to many ideas too strongly. I feel like I've changed my mind on everything in the last ten years.

03:20:02
<transcript>: So there's hope that I can change and I can reform and become a better advocate and not just live in my little house, here in the ozarks and code on my stuff and ignore the outside world. I mostly ignore the outside world. That's the problem. I'm pretty isolated. I should probably.

03:20:02
<transcript>: use my

03:20:09
harry_kd: *6

03:20:09
<transcript>: Use my energy for something outside of my little world. At times I don't do a good job.

03:20:09
<transcript>: yes

03:20:14
<transcript>: Yes. Ignore us. Okay. Well, I'll ignore chat. We'll try that account.

03:20:19
<transcript>: Thank you, Warren. Getting me back on track.

03:20:25
<transcript>: I don't know. I actually prefer tech streamers doing non co streams some parasocial thingy going on here.

03:20:25
<transcript>: okay

03:20:38
<transcript>: Okay, here we go. One last message from YouTube comments to twitch chat. I've met at least five people who I appreciate very much. Your charm helps me make friends and motivates me. Thank you so much, Adam, for streaming, even though you don't have to. Wow.

03:20:44

03:20:44
<transcript>: with all

03:20:46
<transcript>: With all of my non takes.

03:20:49
<transcript>: Let's do some more stamping stuff. I do have a lot to do.

03:20:49
<transcript>: let's

03:20:52
<transcript>: Let's just get it done.

03:20:56
oetziofficial: well i appreciate you giving it a try <3

03:21:07
<transcript>: We're just going to leave the icon. I decided and this is going to take us to an account page. I guess I got to make an account page. How do I make a new page? There's going to be like five files I have to make. I bet. First, let's go the router, router.

03:21:11
<transcript>: We'll go ahead and just make a route pointing to something.

03:21:16
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:21:19
<transcript>: This home.

03:21:24
<transcript>: Let's just copy this one.

03:21:24
<transcript>: let's

03:21:26
<transcript>: Let's say account.

03:21:33
<transcript>: Am I going to make a whole new controller for this or show you use the home controller.

03:21:38
<transcript>: Maybe I'll just use the home controller.

03:21:47
<transcript>: Osci. I appreciate you giving it try. I'm going to give it a try. Let's see. I really am. I'm going to think about this more. My wife. I'm going to talk with my wife about it. She'll have some harsh words for me.

03:21:47
<transcript>: she'll come down on

03:21:49
<transcript>: She'll come down on me pretty hard.

03:21:49
<transcript>: when i

03:22:05
<transcript>: When I tell her, maybe I need to think about things more because I realized today I just don't think about things that affect other people. And she's like, yeah, you should. You jerk. No, she won't say that. Oh, no. I'm perpetuating the meme that my wife doesn't like me. She really does. I promise. Let's go to the home controller. Let's just see.

03:22:07
warrenbuffering: If you put everything in one controller there's only one controller to check

03:22:11

03:23:02
<transcript>: warren if

03:23:12
<transcript>: Warren, if you put everything in one controller, there's only one controller. Check. That's a great idea. That's a really good idea. Metacognition going on right now. Thinking about thinking. That's right.

03:23:17
<transcript>: I got to do more of that. Just more thinking in general.

03:23:27
<transcript>: Okay.

03:23:30
<transcript>: What am I doing in here.

03:23:43
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't see any reason to make another controller. That sounds awful.

harry_kd: :). You're very positive person adam. Your yt videos give me inspiration for real to continue through the day. :D  Wish I could sub, but my country doesn't have international payment methods, so I go on other streams and try to raid you. :D

03:41:51
<transcript>: I just thought I'd try an afternoon sleam. I know someone. Afternoon stream. Someone told me yesterday they can't watch in the morning. They popped in and they're like, I wish you would stream another time. I thought, you know what I should. I don't care anymore about viewership because I'm partner. You know how it feels once you got partner. It's like, I don't care if there's, like, 20 people here, we'll stream. It'll be a good time.

03:41:51
<transcript>: not worried

03:41:56
<transcript>: Not worried about those partnership numbers anymore. I don't know.

03:41:58

03:42:05
<transcript>: A very positive person. Adam, your YouTube videos give me inspiration for real to continue through the day. I wish I could sub but my country doesn't have international payment methods, so I go on those streams and try to raid you.

03:42:19
<transcript>: f

03:42:35
<transcript>: F those numbers. Who cares? It's honestly, it's made me so much more open to doing weird things on stream. Like now I've thought about like, I don't know. Don't want to just do some ASMR streams where I just stream without talking. And you just listen to my keyboard and music, and people can show up for that. Who cares.

03:42:38
jokestera_e: If there is more than one tsintall package is it possible they could conflict and ts doesnt know which to use?

03:42:38
<transcript>: It's not for everybody. I don't care.

I literally live next to Mount everest. That's so cool, Harry.

03:46:54
<transcript>: How are you? Late? How are you lately, Adam. Life been good. Yeah. Triv. I feel like I'm peeking. Feel like life is as good as it could possibly be. I feel like this is the season of life. I'm going to look back on my wife and I are going to look back and be like.

<transcript>: that was good

03:47:11
<transcript>: That was good. It was good. Everything was good. The kids, the house, all of our health. It's all good. And I feel like it's only downhill from here. And that sounds very pessimistic. But I'm just trying to prepare myself like, life can't always be this good. And it's really good right now.

03:47:23
<transcript>: I mostly watch your YouTube videos. And I have a small js programming group where I show your urine and primogen videos from YouTube. Hope that's okay. It's fine, Harry. I've not made very many of them. There's just a handful.

I kind of feel like we've got our oxygen mask on now, and I guess the only thing I can think left in life, someone said earlier, I'm doing Side Quest. It's kind of like, yeah, how can I help other people put their oxygen mask on? That's probably it. I don't know what that looks like yet. I'm still trying to figure it out.

dmdboi: Hello, I like money

03:53:13

<transcript>: How could I actually help them set them up to succeed if they just needed some mentorship? And I know like I say that I get so many dms and not like I'm special, but I do get a lot of dms from people asking for that so I can't just do it for everybody. Or I would just not have enough time in the day. And I still do have obligations with stat muse and with some things.

03:53:15
<transcript>: yeah

03:53:19
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't know I don't know the best way to use my time.

I followed you just in case you might need second person from Nepal atm in your life. :D  I am guessing I wont' be much help to you, but if you need help I will be here do everyting in my power to if I can. :)  Say  "Namaste and K chha " to your co-worker for me. :D

03:54:32
<transcript>: Oh, there's no render.

03:54:32
<transcript>: okay

03:54:34
<transcript>: Okay. That seems important.

03:54:37
oetziofficial: adam is wandering his mind today. is this the adhd people talk about?

03:54:39
<transcript>: Did I see the error message said no. Render.

03:54:46
<transcript>: Let's see. Aj. Just you and dax getting ripped.

03:54:46
<transcript>: what

03:54:49
<transcript>: What? Fix that muse and make me money, okay.

03:54:49
<transcript>: twitch

03:54:56
<transcript>: Twitch Boot Camp, but actually, Fitness. I love these ideas. Keep them coming. Just give us all MacBooks.

03:54:57
trivenge: i need to save up for the 1 on 1 call

03:55:00
<transcript>: Force all of your sammy's employees to participate in the boot camp.

03:55:00
trivenge: its better than a macbook anyways

03:55:02
xypher66: what are the benefits of using elixir for your api?

03:55:12
warrenbuffering: Real talk, we need more people re-grounding the industry

03:55:14
goodgrandpaa: Can you put a !count for the macbook command? I'd love to see how many redeems there are haha

03:55:19
harry_kd: @adamdotdev is this atrovim/lunarvim? or your custom dotfiles?

03:55:19
adamdotdev: !elixir

03:55:19
fossabot: Statmuse uses Elixir because an early engineer particularly enjoyed it. It's a great language and an intro to functional programming so you should check it out https://elixir-lang.org/

03:55:20
<transcript>: That's so cool. I love Nepal. Oh, you guys are talking. Adam is wandering his mind today. Is this the adhd people talking about? Yeah, I think so. I'm all over the place. I need to save up for the one on one call. Yeah, better than the macbook. That's right. What are the benefits of using elixir for your api? Did we make an elixir command.

03:55:20
<transcript>: we're actually moving

03:55:22
dmmulroy: @warrenbuffering this so much

03:55:23
<transcript>: We're actually moving away from elixir. Believe it or not.

03:55:32
trivenge: elixir is a scam? POGGERS

03:55:35
oetziofficial: uuuuh the salad looks delicious

03:55:40
xypher66: what are you moving over to from elixir? @adamdotdev

03:55:40
<transcript>: So I don't know that I would speak to the benefits of it right now. Real talk. We need more people. Regrounding the industry. Oh, Warren, tell me more. Say more words about that. Say more words about regrounding the industry. Because I do feel like there's something amiss. Something amiss. And I'd love to be part of the solution.

03:55:49
<transcript>: Can you put account for the macbook command? I'd love to see how many redeems there are. Oh, great question. Good grandpa. I think I can look in my.

03:55:50
cmgriffing: !lurking but @xypher66 because everything is message passing you can get things like memcache natively and scale horizontally with little effort

03:55:51
<transcript>: Can I look in here.

03:55:55
<transcript>: Macbook.

03:55:55
<transcript>: does it say every time

03:55:57
<transcript>: Does it say Every time someone.

03:56:03
harry_kd: DO NOT USE ELIXIR :: ITS DEAD LANGUAGE

03:56:03
<transcript>: I don't think it does any. It doesn't tell me. Redeems in here, does it.

03:56:03
<transcript>: shoot

03:56:05
<transcript>: Shoot.

03:56:09
<transcript>: I wish I could see how many there have been historically.

03:56:09
warrenbuffering: I feel like you're already doing it man. That's why I'm here

03:56:12
<transcript>: I can't.

03:56:14
<transcript>: Bummer. That would have been cool.

03:56:17
superavit1000: @adamdotdev please explain why are you leaving elixir?

03:56:25
<transcript>: Is this the. Is this Astrovim Lunarvim or your custom dot files? It's custom. Harry. It's in my dot files. Yeah.

03:56:25
<transcript>: this

03:56:29
<transcript>: This so much ooh. Talk more about the regrounding. The salad does look. The.

03:56:29
<transcript>: i'm so excited

03:56:30
iannery: do you work out?

03:56:35
cmgriffing: @harry_kd the type safe flavor of it is appealing and coming along nicely

03:56:41
dmmulroy: @cmgriffing To build off of griff, you should check out OTP - it's what makes Erlang and Elixir great and it's just cool engineering

03:56:45
<transcript>: I'm so excited to eat it, but I also just feel like a slob eating it in front of you people. What are you moving over to from elixir? Oh, we're writing it in astro. Ziper. It's astro. So typescript. Chris is here lurking. But Ziphor, because everything is.

03:56:45
<transcript>: message passing

03:56:51
<transcript>: Message passing. You can get things like Mooncash natively and scale horizontally with a little effort. Yeah, it's definitely good for parallel.

03:56:51
<transcript>: parallelization

03:56:53
cmgriffing: @dmmulroy 100%

03:56:55
pbertrand_dev: hey @cmgriffing

03:56:57
harry_kd: @SuperAvit1000 You can talk to me if you want, I was intial conributor. whisper to me

03:56:58
xypher66: oh i thought astro was for static sitexs

03:57:05
<transcript>: Parallelization. I don't know. Gen servers and all this stuff. Kill your children. Do not use elixir. It's a dead language. I feel like you're already doing it, man. That's why I'm here. Okay, so, Warren, I need to speak more with you about this, because I want to do it more intentionally.

03:57:06
cmgriffing: Highest recorded uptime ever recorded is an Erlang install

03:57:11
<transcript>: I feel like if I'm doing it, I don't know it and I should probably know it so I can do it better.

03:57:18
<transcript>: Please explain why you were leaving elixir. I think we just talked about it. So we're leaving elixir. Because.

03:57:21
<transcript>: Short version.

03:57:22
<transcript>: Is.

03:57:40
cmgriffing: @pbertrand_dev howdy

03:57:40
jenswoeste: regarding the number of macbook redemptions I just asked chatGPT. "I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I do not have access to information about Adam's  channel or their 'win-a-macbook' redemptions."

03:57:42
<transcript>: We wrote it in elixir because it was just an engineer that really loved elixir and wanted to use it for production in his day job. So we let him do it. He built it all on elixir. He's no longer at the company, and we don't have anybody else who has a lot of elixir familiarity. And it's a huge code base, and we need to be able to move faster and work in it more effectively and hire people that can help.

03:57:42
<transcript>: work on it

03:57:43
cmgriffing: ok back to lurking

03:57:46
<transcript>: Work on it. So we're moving away from elixir. That's it. That's really it.

03:57:50
<transcript>: Do you work out? Sometimes.

03:58:05
<transcript>: I actually just started Adam West and linked a thing called My Body tutor on Twitter, and I just signed up for it. I just had my first call today, so it's like going to keep me accountable, make sure I'm working out. I'm being healthy. It's like a physical trainer or personal trainer.

03:58:14
pbertrand_dev: body tutor?

03:58:15
<transcript>: To build off of grid. You should check out otp. It's what makes erling an electric. Great. And it's just cool. Engineering. Yeah, that's the big draw, isn't it.

03:58:19
warrenbuffering: New devs coming into the industry get distracted by fancy libs, chase high salaries, etc. All of your ivory tower talk + everyone thinks they need to work for a FAANG and forgot you can build your own

03:58:19
pbertrand_dev: sounds .... interesting

03:58:31
<transcript>: That sure was for static sites. They've got ssr and astro. It's like PHP. It's really like writing PHP in typescript. At this point highest recorded of time ever recorded is an erlang install. Interesting.

03:58:37
warrenbuffering: I'm firing off the cuff and hadn't tried to put it into words before, but that feels like a start?

03:58:39
<transcript>: Regarding the number of MacBook redemptions I just asked chat gvt I'm sorry as an AI language, apologize.

03:58:45
<transcript>: That's funny. All right, see you, Chris. Enjoy your lurk. I'm not going to be on here much longer. Body tutor? Yeah. Bertrand.

03:58:54
<transcript>: It's like an accountability thing. They just ask you what you eat and how you worked out every day, that kind of thing. I don't know. It really worked for Adam Watson. It look it up.

03:58:54
<transcript>: new

03:58:55
simon_aa: why don't you hire an elixir dev then?

03:59:01
harry_kd: @adamdotdev you could hire me. :P, I already know a lot about haskell/exlixir compiler. and also can switch away from it. lmao. :D

03:59:07
cmgriffing: @Simon_AA they are rare

03:59:09
<transcript>: New devs coming into the industry. Get distracted by fancy Libs Chase, high salaries, et cetera. All of your Ivory tower talk. Plus, everyone thinks they need to work for a thing and forget you can build your own. Yes, I am. All for being.

03:59:11
lesabotsy: How is Astro + React combination?

03:59:15
<transcript>: A person who can do it all I'm all for just being able to build anything you want to build.

03:59:15
<transcript>: and no one can

03:59:18
<transcript>: And no one can stand in your way and you have all the leverage.

03:59:27
<transcript>: That might look like starting a startup. It might look like Indie hacking, or it might look like something else entirely. Consulting, freelance, whatever. But I am all for.

03:59:32
<transcript>: Learning to be self sufficient in that way and do work that doesn't depend on.

03:59:35
<transcript>: Working at fang or whatever.

03:59:37
<transcript>: Okay.

03:59:37
<transcript>: firing off

03:59:42
goodgrandpaa: It's hard af to get into startups when it's data reliant haha

03:59:44
trivenge: im gonna get to a point where i work for adam for free so that i can convince him to be a reference SeemsGood  #internship

03:59:46
<transcript>: Firing off. Covid hadn't tried to put into Words four, but that feels like a start. No, it's great, Warren. Very good. Spectate. Spectate prime. Thank you so much. That follow.

03:59:46
<transcript>: why don't you hire

03:59:51
<transcript>: Why don't you hire an elixir dev, then? Well, Simon.

03:59:51
<transcript>: there's i guess

03:59:52
<transcript>: There's, I guess.

03:59:52
pbertrand_dev: I prefer to call it indiehaxoring

03:59:53
<transcript>: Like.

03:59:58
<transcript>: I didn't view it as a dead language, but I do think.

03:59:59
dmmulroy: @Lesabotsy we just rewrote https://skolem.com/ w/ it and it went pretty smoothly

04:00:03
warrenbuffering: All 5 of the elixir devs already have jobs

04:00:04
<transcript>: It's harder to find a lixard devs that check all the other boxes and that would be a good fit here.

04:00:12
<transcript>: Yeah, that's mainly it. And because I'm going to be doing a lot of the work and I'd rather move faster in typescript because I'm more familiar with it.

04:00:14
superavit1000: it's lot harder to find them that is true

04:00:14
dmmulroy: @warrenbuffering LUL

04:00:25
<transcript>: I could hire Harry, though I already know a lot about Haskellixer compiler and also can switch away from it. Hey, well, let's talk, Harry. I don't think we're going to stick with the licks. I've already mostly rewritten the app in typescript in astro, but.

04:00:25
<transcript>: we could still

04:00:27
<transcript>: We could still talk.

04:00:33
<transcript>: How does astro plus react? I've not done the island stuff. I've not done any client side for.

04:00:39
<transcript>: Astro but I suppose it's good. I think if you're writing react, you should probably just use nextjs, though honestly.

04:00:43
<transcript>: It's hard to get into startups when it's data reliant.

04:00:51
<transcript>: You don't get to a point where I work for Adam for free so that I can convince him to be a reference internship.

04:00:51
<transcript>: for

04:00:54
<transcript>: For call it Indie hacksoaring. Okay.

04:00:58
superavit1000: @adamdotdev harry just saying elixir is a dead lang and after that "hire me" he has to be a gem

04:01:00
goodgrandpaa: When you get that paywall up there, will you guys be taking jr devs? Kappa

04:01:01
oetziofficial: well, i gotta go sleep. its late for me & i gotta wake up early. have fun adam & chat!

04:01:03
<transcript>: You just rewrote that scolum in React in astro. That's cool.

04:01:06
<transcript>: All five of the elixir devs already have jobs. Exactly.

04:01:10
lesabotsy: @adamdotdev I heard nextjs are racist so I'll avoid them :p

04:01:14
<transcript>: It's a lot harder to find them. That's true, Harry. Just saying elixir is a deadline. And after that, hire me has to be.

04:01:14
<transcript>: jim

04:01:16
<transcript>: Jim, It's funny.

04:01:16
<transcript>: when you get

04:01:20
<transcript>: When you get that paywall up there, will you guys be taking Junior devs? Well.

04:01:20
<transcript>: we've got runway

04:01:30
<transcript>: We've got runway, we've got money in the bank right now, and we've got pretty good revenue numbers. So it's not that we're waiting to finish the rewrite so much as it is.

04:01:30
<transcript>: well it kind of is

04:01:31
lesabotsy: @dmmulroy thanks, will try it out

04:01:36
<transcript>: Well, it kind of is in the sense that right now it's kind of a hard time in the company's history to parallelize a lot of work.

04:01:41
<transcript>: Like the rewrite. There's parts of it. We have other engineers who are going to be helping me.

04:01:45
<transcript>: It's hard to do at the work right now because it's so Fast and furious.

04:01:49
<transcript>: But once we kind of get out of the rewrite, then Yes.

04:01:49
<transcript>: it'll be more

04:01:50
<transcript>: It'll be more.

04:01:50
<transcript>: like

04:02:10
<transcript>: Likely for us to hire people, but we're also not going to go out and just hire to hire. It'll be opportunistic. We won't just decide we're going to hire five more engineers because we need to increase bandwidth that we did that when we raised our Series A. It did not go well. We just hired a ton of people at once. And I mean, a lot of them were great people in the still here, even some of them. We just grew too fast. We didn't need to.

04:02:10
<transcript>: okay

04:02:16
<transcript>: Okay, co et, go etsy, go to sleep late for me. You got to wake up early. Yeah. Have fun. I'm actually going to get off here pretty quick.

04:02:16
<transcript>: i'm probably going to get off here

04:02:18
<transcript>: I'm probably going to get off here.

04:02:20
<transcript>: Right now ish.

04:02:20
<transcript>: now

04:02:31
harry_kd: @adamdotdev I recently rewrote an app called krispcall.com from elixir to typescript and custom framework. It was voip and really complicated application with hundres of features.  Maybe we should talk for real.

04:02:35
<transcript>: Now ish I'm going to come over here and say goodbye. I'm going to read the last few messages here. When you get that paywall up there, will you guys be taking it? Okay. We just stopped at that hurt nextjs or racist swallowed them. Who told you that? Lisa, they're not racist.

04:02:35
corpsekombucha: take care, asmr keyboard stream sounds good btw :)

04:02:38
<transcript>: I think that's some trolling you heard.

04:02:44
<transcript>: Wow, I'm so out of energy, I'm so beat, I think streaming at the end of my day.

04:02:44
<transcript>: is a lot harder

04:02:46
trivenge: sounds good adam

04:02:54
trivenge: hope you enjoy your day

04:02:54
<transcript>: Is a lot harder. I think I'm like a much lower energy version of myself. When I wake up, I'm like, ready to take on the world. And that's when I start streaming. And it's like, let's do this.

04:02:54
<transcript>: get

04:02:55
superavit1000: @adamdotdev so to substitute elixir what option do you have?

04:03:03
<transcript>: Get some hype music going this time of day I'm like been sitting here 12 hours. I'm kind of done kind of ready to be done.

04:03:03
trivenge: yeah, first 8 hours of yhour day is the most productive

04:03:10
lesabotsy: Dax's word haha

04:03:10
<transcript>: Take care ASMR keyboard stream sounds good, by the way. Yeah, I might do it. I really might.

04:03:21
warrenbuffering: enjoy React conf!

04:03:28
<transcript>: Recently rewrote an app called Chris Call from elixir to typescript and custom framework. It was VoIP and really complicated application with hundreds of features. Maybe we should talk for real. Hey, maybe we should Harry, honestly be amir, are you in the discord? Join the discord. Send me a dm. I'll see that. That's a great way for us to connect.

04:03:28
<transcript>: you

<transcript>: Astro on bun. Okay, I got to stop. I'm just trolling. Sorry, what are you trolling.

04:04:29

<transcript>: Enjoy. Oh, gotcha. Yeah, you're good. Hey, I'm going to miss you all. Enjoy your evening. Your afternoon, whatever it is for you.
