<transcript>: and

11:14:59
cowfacedude99: than I will save up my points LUL

11:15:01
<transcript>: And now I'm trying to put them everywhere.

11:15:06
<transcript>: And it took me like an hour. This morning, I published my first Tik Tok.

11:15:08
<transcript>: What have I done.

11:15:12
<transcript>: Put on YouTube shorts. I'm gonna add it to Instagram.

11:15:12
<transcript>: but

11:15:16
<transcript>: But I'm in the middle of a username swap.

11:15:16
<transcript>: so

11:15:18
<transcript>: So.

11:15:18
<transcript>: i haven't done

11:15:19

11:15:24
<transcript>: Then you'll save up your points. Okay, good idea. Cow face. Save a month.

11:15:31
<transcript>: I think it should. Oh, no, it doesn't work. Now, remember, it, like, opened up the script. I forgot.

11:15:34
<transcript>: Yeah. Why is it so hard.

11:15:38
<transcript>: To figure out how to use a new social media platform.

11:15:38
<transcript>: you just feel so

11:15:50
cowfacedude99: I have enough for one. maybe I an use them back to back LUL

11:15:51
<transcript>: You just feel so weird, like, posting my first TikTok. It's like, oh, people actually do hashtag on TikTok. And it's not dumb. Like, on Twitter. Hashtags are kind of dumb. Like, it's very rare that you should ride a hashtag on Twitter, I think.

11:15:51
<transcript>: on

11:15:55
<transcript>: On Tik Tok apparently it's like you're supposed to.

11:15:59
cowfacedude99: I will*

11:16:07
<transcript>: So the biggest thing that I'm terrified of now that I'm trying to branch into all these short form video platforms is my wife uses them. She uses tik Tok.

11:22:07
<transcript>: I don't have to. I don't really get involved in any of the business things anymore. Like I'm just I'm just building, which is really what I should just be doing. I don't really bring anything in the table with all the other stuff. I did help with fundraising.

11:22:10
<transcript>: That was something I did.

11:22:10
<transcript>: in my previous

11:22:12

<transcript>: Did you say.

11:22:29
<transcript>: Music is so private.

11:22:30
the_philter: this is the highest quality stream I've ever seen on twitch :O

11:22:34
<transcript>: I sold a lot of my stake in Status to new investors.

11:22:44
<transcript>: But the company itself is still private, and I still own some equity in it. So now the company has not been sold, but I did sell.

11:22:44
<transcript>: some

11:22:51
<transcript>: Some of mine. The Filter. Welcome to Chat. This is the high school distribute I've ever seen on twitch. Ever.

11:22:51
<transcript>: on

11:22:53
<transcript>: On Twitch.

11:22:53
<transcript>: series

11:22:54
<transcript>: Series.

11:23:02
<transcript>: I mean, I don't I don't spend a ton of time on twitch. I've really only been on Twitter for the last eight months. Something like that.

11:23:07
<transcript>: The time I've spin on it. I mean, I'm mostly just in, like.

11:23:07
<transcript>: tech people

11:23:10
<transcript>: Tech, People's, twitch channels.

11:23:10
<transcript>: and

11:23:20
<transcript>: And I know I've kind of gone overboard in that space, but I just assume there's gamers with, like, nuts. Oh, setups. I do have a moving camera going right now.

11:23:20
<transcript>: so there's

11:23:22
<transcript>: So there's that.

11:23:22
<transcript>: okay

11:23:25
<transcript>: Okay. I'm a little I'm a little extra.

11:23:28
the_philter: what's the bitrate?

11:23:33
<transcript>: Well, you can see the camera, the moving camera. When I show you this Twitch segment, here's what it's gonna look like. I think this is gonna take me into my screen, which is probably good. We should probably get them done.

11:23:37
<transcript>: What's the bitrate.

11:23:37
<transcript>: i think it's like

11:23:38
<transcript>: I think it's like.

11:23:38
<transcript>: i push it

11:23:43
<transcript>: I push it a little past what they say, I think they say, like, 6500.

11:23:43
<transcript>: and i

11:23:46
<transcript>: And I want to say, I push it to like.

11:23:59
<transcript>: 7500. There's some level you can push it to and it's like, it's okay. It still works. Okay, so here's what it's gonna look like when I'm like, alright, it's time to do a Twitter segment. I'm gonna hit a button.

11:24:07
<transcript>: I don't know about that music.

11:24:20
<transcript>: Same side is that music is best. I'm not entirely sold. I've got a bunch of, like, a bunch of the music from brake Master cylinder and little like.

11:24:25
<transcript>: Bumpers. I think he calls some Stingers.

11:24:25
<transcript>: so

11:24:29
tymekdev: I think something more upbeat or shorter?

11:24:30
krimo47: that's not even extra, that's like cinema level of extra

11:24:30
<transcript>: So there's other choices. Not sure I'm gonna go with that one, but that's the idea. It'll just be like a.

11:24:30
<transcript>: little screen

11:24:33
<transcript>: Little screen little like title screen.

11:24:43
<transcript>: Something more upbeat and shorter. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. That was too long and drawn out. It's not even actually that's like Cinema level of extra. There you go. That's what we're going for.

11:24:43
<transcript>: that's the

11:24:50
<transcript>: That's the goal. I want you to feel like you're watching a movie when you watch me, right? Terrible. Javascript code.

11:24:54
<transcript>: So.

11:25:01
<transcript>: I'm resisting the urge. Time act to go in and change which song? Oh, I do have. Okay, I'm gonna do it.

11:25:01
<transcript>: and i'm

11:25:03
<transcript>: And I'm doing that thing where.

11:25:06
<transcript>: Where I change my overlays.

11:25:12
<transcript>: Live on twitch. That's never fun. So let's say.

11:25:20
<transcript>: Oh, I don't even have to change my overlays. Hang on. It's just in my stream deck. It's just right here.

11:25:24
<transcript>: Configure? Why is that open? No. Get out of here.

11:25:24
<transcript>: get out of here

11:25:26
<transcript>: Get out of here.

11:25:30
greenshoesbrownsocks: what does your daily routine look like during the work week?

11:25:38
<transcript>: Everyone always recommends D script, and every time I use descript, I realize it just. It does lots of things, but not the things I need. I don't need it to transcribe. I transcribe.

11:25:38
<transcript>: using other things

11:25:39
<transcript>: Using other things.

11:25:46
<transcript>: And it only exports to like 720p, which is a bummer. Okay, so let's change this.

11:25:54
<transcript>: I think the default track is better. I'm just gonna remove track. Okay, now it should be better. Here we go. I'm not actually doing.

11:26:02
<transcript>: A segment on Twitter. Unless you guys want to read Twitter, we could read Twitter to start the day. I'm just showing you what this looks like. Here we go, here we go.

<transcript>: Is that better.

11:26:17
<transcript>: Is it better.

11:26:22
<transcript>: What do we think? Is that sound? Is that sound better? The song.

11:26:24
<transcript>: For a Twitter segment.

11:26:24
<transcript>: you gotta have different songs

11:26:28
<transcript>: You gotta have different songs for each segment. Different little audio clips, you know.

11:26:28
<transcript>: i thought about

11:26:33
<transcript>: I thought about like hiring a narrator having like a very like.

11:27:11
<transcript>: And what do I do.

11:27:11
<transcript>: i

11:27:14
<transcript>: I I mean, I've honestly just like.

11:27:14
<transcript>: piddler now

11:27:16
uberrick: randomness

11:27:21
<transcript>: Piddler now that I'm streaming, so if we're talking like my current routine now that I just started streaming again.

11:27:27
<transcript>: I used I guess I did have 2 hours before my stream.

11:27:27
<transcript>: now

11:27:33
<transcript>: Now no, I still have 2 hours. I just lost an hour of sleep by getting up to my 04:00 alarm this morning.

11:27:33
<transcript>: i just lost an hour

11:27:37
<transcript>: I just lost an hour of sleep. That's why I feel like this. I kind of feel like I'm dragging.

11:27:41
krimo47: 4 AM, isn't that like insanly eaarly ?

11:27:42
<transcript>: So I get it before I've got 2 hours before I start streaming.

11:27:48
<transcript>: And right now, that means just making sure everything's gonna work for my stream.

11:27:49
<transcript>: For those 2 hours.

11:27:49
<transcript>: i record

11:27:51
<transcript>: I record a little teaser.

11:27:51
<transcript>: so the little

11:27:56
<transcript>: So the little like thing that I'm gonna publish on Twitter and elsewhere.

11:27:58
<transcript>: And then.

11:27:58
<transcript>: i'm streaming

11:28:02
<transcript>: I'm streaming for 4 hours from six to ten my time.

11:28:02
<transcript>: and then

11:28:03
<transcript>: And then I'll.

11:28:03
<transcript>: probably

11:28:07
<transcript>: Probably like go upstairs and see my family after that.

11:28:09
marcusbuer: good morning yall  o/

11:28:14
<transcript>: My wife's been bringing me breakfast during my stream. So then eating on stream, which is kind of weird.

11:28:14
<transcript>: but

11:28:18
<transcript>: But I eat sometimes during that window and then.

11:28:18
<transcript>: after

11:28:27
<transcript>: After seeing my family, I would come back down and work until so right now I'm working till three, which they like savings.

11:28:27
<transcript>: it's

11:28:38
<transcript>: It's so confusing. Why is daylight Savings so confusing? Like my brain? Because we don't. The reason it's so confusing is we don't move our kids schedule. We just leave it.

11:28:38
<transcript>: we're just

11:28:44
<transcript>: We're just leaving them on the old time until they naturally kind of get into it.

11:28:44
<transcript>: mickey

11:28:48
<transcript>: Mickey, thank you so much, Mickey.

11:28:48
<transcript>: oh

11:28:53
<transcript>: Oh, did I see? Erdham. Thank you for the follow urdham. The dev. I don't know if I saw that.

11:28:53
<transcript>: yes we're leaving

11:28:56
<transcript>: Yes. We're leaving our kids on the old schedule.

11:28:56
<transcript>: and so we're

11:28:59
<transcript>: And so we're just, like, everything shifted.

11:28:59
<transcript>: later

11:29:06
<transcript>: Later in the night time. Like we're staying up an hour later than what? The clock set. I don't know. I don't even know.

11:29:06
<transcript>: i'm not

11:29:09
<transcript>: I'm not even a try I give up.

11:29:14
<transcript>: I think we're getting rid of the daylight Savings Time thing in the US. Think we're gonna stop.

11:29:14
<transcript>: but

11:29:14
cowfacedude99: Best way to do daylight schedule.... Don't LUL

11:29:18
<transcript>: But yeah. So I'm taking off at three.

11:29:30
<transcript>: Best way to do daylight schedule don't exactly we're able to ignore it for most things in life like we don't interface with the outside world that much. My streaming schedule is maybe the only.

11:29:30
<transcript>: thing

11:29:31
<transcript>: Thing.

11:29:37
<transcript>: That's like a published time. I have to do a certain thing and other people expect it to be at that certain time.

11:29:44
<transcript>: Yeah. Oh. So my schedule. Then after I take off at three.

11:29:44
<transcript>: i

11:29:53
<transcript>: I play with my boys. That's it. I've got two boys, eight and three. And we do a lot of playing Legos.

11:29:55
<transcript>: Reading books.

11:30:02
<transcript>: Three olds got sick red now so doing a lot of reading books on the couch and smuggling.

11:30:05
<transcript>: And then I go to bed like, nine.

11:30:05
<transcript>: so that's it

11:30:11
<transcript>: So that's it okay. Somebody asked that. And then I just kind of went on a very long meandering story.

11:30:17
cowfacedude99: I had a pretty good headache when I had standups with people from US.

11:30:18
<transcript>: 04:00 a.m.. Isn't that like insanely early? Yeah. I mean, it's early, but I get it. I go to bed early. So nine to four, I still get.

11:30:18
<transcript>: seven hours

11:30:20
<transcript>: 7 hours.

11:30:20
<transcript>: i mean i sleep

11:30:21
<transcript>: I mean, I sleep enough.

11:30:35
<transcript>: Good morning, Marcus. Best way to do daylights get. Oh, I already read that I had a pretty good headache when I had standups with people from us. Yeah, this. I remember working on teams. We actually have to coordinate with people and have stuff on the calendar.

11:30:38
<transcript>: Daylight savings sucks for that stuff.

11:30:38
<transcript>: especially when

11:30:40
<transcript>: Especially when it's a remote team that's international.

11:30:45
<transcript>: All right.

11:30:51
<transcript>: Shall we get something done? Shall we finish this page.

11:30:51
<transcript>: feel good

11:30:53
<transcript>: Feel good to finish this page.

11:30:56
<transcript>: Should look like.

11:30:59
<transcript>: This does look like.

11:30:59
<transcript>: that

11:31:00
<transcript>: That.

11:31:01
tymekdev: Oh, yeah. We got to know firsthand who respects DST when.

11:31:05
<transcript>: And that's not even real. That's all just fake markup.

11:31:08
<transcript>: I want to get this done today.

11:31:08
<transcript>: this

11:31:10
<transcript>: This Game Result page.

11:31:10
<transcript>: and

11:31:13
<transcript>: And then what else I want to do today.

11:31:19
<transcript>: Might be it.

11:31:24
<transcript>: Might be it might just look at Twitter after that.

11:31:30
<transcript>: Oh, I forgot. I'm gonna come over here and talk about this before I get started.

11:31:35
cowfacedude99: bash killed me today with singlequotes and double quotes.

11:31:35
<transcript>: I forgot, I forgot watch, Dan.

11:31:35
<transcript>: yet

11:31:37
<transcript>: Yet another side project.

11:31:42
<transcript>: So, DAX and I, you know, DAX.

11:31:48
adamdotdev: !discord

11:31:49
fossabot: Adam is a member of the watch.dev Discord server and he'd love to see you there: https://discord.gg/watchdotdev

11:31:54
<transcript>: Dax and I have started something called Watch div. So now if you look at our discord command, says a member of the Watch dev Discord server.

11:31:57
<transcript>: So it's just like a joint.

11:31:57
<transcript>: single

11:32:14
<transcript>: Single Discord server server for any Dev streamers that don't want to create their own their own server. I didn't love having a server that was just my there's just so many discord servers, and it felt kind of like polluting the world with another Discord server server by creating one that's like Adam.

11:32:14
<transcript>: i don't know

11:32:16
<transcript>: I don't know. That just so weird.

11:32:16
<transcript>: and

11:32:23
cowfacedude99: wait. you got the discord verified?

11:32:28
<transcript>: And I wanted to do this for a long time, but I didn't know you could set up multiple twitch connections to a single discord server. And then when I learned you can. This idea was born overnight over the weekend.

11:32:28
<transcript>: so

11:32:29
<transcript>: So.

11:32:34
<transcript>: Got the discord verified? I don't think so. Did we? Is it verify.

11:32:36
<transcript>: I don't know.

11:32:36
<transcript>: did

11:32:38
<transcript>: Did we.

11:32:48
<transcript>: Oh, you mean the link not just boosted it 14 times or whatever. So we got that custom link. Is that what you mean.

11:32:50
<transcript>: So watch Dev.

11:32:50
<transcript>: if you just

11:32:56
cowfacedude99: yes.

11:32:57
vighi_: !cam

11:32:59
<transcript>: If you just go to watch dev in your browser, it'll just take you to the discord. We might put something else on that like a page that talks about what it is. But the idea is.

11:32:59
<transcript>: multip

11:33:01
<transcript>: Multiple streamers.

11:33:05
<transcript>: Will have I should make an alias for that vig.

11:33:05
<transcript>: welcome

11:33:07
<transcript>: Welcome.

11:33:07
<transcript>: my chat

11:33:08
adamdotdev: !camera

11:33:08
fossabot: Adam uses two main cameras, a Sony A7S III with a Sony FE 35mm F1.8 Lens which sits behind a teleprompter and serves as the wide angle shot of the office. As well as a Sony A7 IV with a Sony FE 50mm F1.2 GM which is used for the green screen camera whilst Adam is sharing his screen.

11:33:08
<transcript>: My chat.

11:33:10
<transcript>: I think Camera works.

11:33:10
<transcript>: if it's

11:33:13
<transcript>: If it's not out of date.

11:33:17
vighi_: Hi

11:33:21
<transcript>: Multiple streamers. So Me and dax right now are the only two in there, but there will be like a channel for every streamer. Okay.

11:33:21
<transcript>: and

11:33:29
<transcript>: And if you stream programming on twitch, you can have a home on Watch dev. And we can kind of consolidate.

11:33:29
<transcript>: our

11:33:40
<transcript>: Our communities a bit. And more importantly, it's just like if you're a streamer and you want to connect with people off of twitch, like you're not streaming today, but you still want to hang out with people.

11:33:40
<transcript>: then

11:33:48
<transcript>: Then I mean you can go to people's other streams and hang out and chat, but to have a discord home without having to create your own server. That's the idea.

11:33:48
<transcript>: and i'm

11:33:50
<transcript>: And I'm still not sure.

11:33:50
<transcript>: like

11:33:57
<transcript>: Like we're kind of discussing, like, does it make sense to bring in established Dev streamers.

11:33:57
<transcript>: who

11:34:03
uberrick: It's a great idea, I hate having so many different discord servers :D

11:34:04
<transcript>: Who already have their own independent servers that are really established, like if they have.

11:34:04
<transcript>: a pretty

11:34:20
<transcript>: A pretty thriving discord community already. Does it make sense for them to have a presence on watch dev. I'm sure we could get those people to come in. And I've already spoken with a couple of them that would love to create a channel and be part of it. I just don't know, like if they already have their big thriving discord server.

11:34:20
<transcript>: what is that

11:34:25
<transcript>: What is that dynamic? Why spend any time on our little watch Dev community.

11:34:25
<transcript>: i don't know

11:34:26
<transcript>: I don't know.

11:34:26
<transcript>: i

11:34:28
<transcript>: I would love.

11:34:28
<transcript>: you are

11:34:31
<transcript>: You are all thoughts, ideas.

11:34:31
<transcript>: rick

11:34:49
<transcript>: Rick says it's a great idea. I hate having so many different discord servers. There you go. Yeah. It's kind of like a discord server. It's a community centered around just live programming. If you enjoy watching people stream programming on twitch, or you enjoy streaming programming on twitch, this is a discord server for you.

11:34:49
<transcript>: watch dev

11:34:51
<transcript>: Watch? Dev.

11:34:52
<transcript>: There you go.

11:34:59
vighi_: Something like an aggregator?

11:35:03
tymekdev: I like the idea. Small streamers will do just fine with a channel and it won't feel pushed for them

11:35:07
<transcript>: It's like it's a day old, and we just kind of converted my discord server, so there's probably still some weird cobwebs that are to be worked out. Something like an aggregator. Yeah.

11:35:14
<transcript>: Small streamers will do just fine with a channel, and it won't feel pushed for them. Yeah, I agree.

11:35:18
<transcript>: Well, I can show it. I'll show it on here.

11:35:21
alexkates: I like the idea, especially if thinking about starting a stream. I can see getting a channel listed in the server can help

11:35:23
<transcript>: Right now. Well, now, I won't hang on because I want to do this.

11:35:26
<transcript>: I'm okay.

11:35:31
<transcript>: I don't often share.

11:35:35
<transcript>: My discord.

11:35:39
<transcript>: And I just want to make sure.

11:35:39
<transcript>: it's

11:35:41
<transcript>: It's okay to share it.

11:35:48
<transcript>: I'm gonna unmaximize it okay. You're gonna see all kinds of, like, stuff.

11:35:48
<transcript>: that

11:35:51
<transcript>: That I normally wouldn't show? Oh, here, I can do this.

11:35:53
<transcript>: I.

11:35:53
<transcript>: 'm gonna

11:35:55
<transcript>: 'm Gonna Share it here I go.

11:35:55
<transcript>: i think this

11:35:58
<transcript>: I think this is okay, because there's nothing private.

11:35:58
<transcript>: well there might be some

11:36:04
<transcript>: Well, there might be some private stuff. Oh, if you're a sub. Oh, yeah? So there's another kind of perk, I guess.

11:36:05
<transcript>: You could just say.

11:36:11
<transcript>: Any one of the developers you like to watch on twitch and then you have access to the subscriber channel.

11:36:11
<transcript>: which is

11:36:20
<transcript>: Which is subscribers from all the different streamers into one big pool. And I might I've got all kinds of ideas. I might do something like.

11:36:20
<transcript>: here let me

11:36:21
<transcript>: Here, let me share it.

11:36:26
<transcript>: Here it is.

11:36:26
<transcript>: watch

11:36:28
<transcript>: Watch? Dev.

11:36:35
<transcript>: So I might even do something where like if you subscribe to multiple Dev streamers.

11:36:39
<transcript>: In this server, you get additional benefits like.

11:36:39
<transcript>: a super private

11:36:44
<transcript>: A super private channel. I don't know. We could do different things, but right now you can see like we've just got.

11:36:44
<transcript>: a me and

11:36:46
<transcript>: A Me and a dax channel.

11:36:46
<transcript>: we'll be adding

11:36:53
<transcript>: We'll be adding the next streamers shortly. There's a subscriber channel. I don't know some stuff.

11:36:56
<transcript>: That's really it. It's just a place.

11:36:56
<transcript>: to kind of have

11:36:58
<transcript>: To kind of have like one community.

11:37:01
<transcript>: And Me and dax don't have to have separate servers. Now.

11:37:13
<transcript>: Alex, I like the idea, especially of thinking about starting a stream. I can see getting a channel listed in server can help exactly.

11:37:25
<transcript>: And, oh, I want to do, like, notifications. So like, the idea is to build out where there's kind of like automated notifications when everyone goes live. So if a streamer in this server goes live, everyone gets a notification, that kind of thing.

11:37:25
<transcript>: there's just

11:37:27
<transcript>: There's just a lot I might do with it.

11:37:31
<transcript>: I also might not, and I just kind of like, be cool.

11:37:31
<transcript>: and calm

11:37:33
alexkates: Also I could see a "watch.dev" stream starter kit

11:37:34
<transcript>: And calm and not go crazy.

11:37:35
uberrick: adamsincubator.dev

11:37:36
uberrick: :D

11:37:38
stormix_co: Sounds sick :)

11:37:38
<transcript>: Sometimes I go crazy with side projects.

11:37:57
cowfacedude99: about the notifications, ask BG...

11:37:58
<transcript>: Also, I could see a waste dev stream starter kit. There you go. Alex. We got just help educate people who want to stream software. Dev. I love this idea of streaming programming. It's just so fun to me, and I want other devs to be able to experience that. So to the extent that we could create a little community that helps.

11:37:58
<transcript>: dev

11:38:01
<transcript>: Devs get into streaming.

11:38:01
<transcript>: that's awesome

11:38:01
stormix_co: @alexkates I love this

11:38:03
<transcript>: That's awesome. That's a cool mission.

11:38:06
uberrick: You'll have your own label of dev streamers who you own

11:38:07
<transcript>: Adam's incubator. Dev.

11:38:09
nzlaura: could be a good sell to gaming/content orgs

11:38:09
tymekdev: @alexkates +1

11:38:12
<transcript>: Stormix. Welcome to Chat. Sounds sick. I'm glad you think so.

11:38:18
uberrick: LUL

11:38:18
<transcript>: Let's see bath of notifications ask BG from Al fy mean BG.

11:38:22
<transcript>: There's. That what you mean.

11:38:28
<transcript>: You love this. Okay. Okay. We got some good feedback.

11:38:28
<transcript>: have your own

11:38:31
<transcript>: Have your own label of dev streamers who you own.

11:38:31
<transcript>: we own

11:38:32
stormix_co: Thank you! Love the background btw!

11:38:33
<transcript>: We own them.

11:38:33
<transcript>: no i think

11:38:37
cowfacedude99: yes. quirk has a go-live notification.

11:38:40
vighi_: you basically want to create a netowork for dev streamers

11:38:46
<transcript>: No, I think the thing that is interesting is, I don't know. Right now me and dax just have, like, full admin privileges in this thing. I think in order for it to work, I think every streamer.

11:38:46
<transcript>: has to have

11:38:49
<transcript>: Has to have pretty high privileges in the server to be able to create.

11:38:57
<transcript>: The kind of things like adding emotes and doing like channels and all the stuff that we want people to feel like it's their little home.

11:39:06
<transcript>: Yeah, I think being a streamer on here, you're gonna have quite a lot of privileges. I guess what I'm trying to say is like, I don't think I own anybody here because.

11:39:06
<transcript>: they own just as

11:39:09
<transcript>: They own just as much of it if they become a part of it.

11:39:16
<transcript>: Could be a good sell to gaming and content. Orgs interesting.

11:39:20
<transcript>: In Z.

11:39:23
<transcript>: Love the background by the way.

11:39:23
<transcript>: my background

11:39:27
<transcript>: My background, like behind me, the stuff behind me.

11:39:30
stormix_co: Yes!

11:39:37
<transcript>: I put a lot. I'm acting surprised. I put a lot of time into the background. I did not accidentally get this background. Cool. Yeah. It's a lego Buildings that I lit.

11:39:37
<transcript>: that's

11:39:40
<transcript>: That's the main part of it that you're seeing.

11:39:45
<transcript>: Okay, let's actually get something done. Now let's see if I can.

11:39:45
<transcript>: i'm just gonna

11:39:46
<transcript>: I'm just gonna go fuzzy.

11:39:46
<transcript>: just

11:39:51
<transcript>: Just while I move discord back into its home.

11:39:53
<transcript>: So I don't overshare.

11:39:53
<transcript>: and docs

11:39:56
<transcript>: And docs myself or something.

11:39:56
<transcript>: so yeah

11:39:59
<transcript>: So, yeah, join, watch, dev. It's.

11:40:03
<transcript>: It's early days but.

11:40:12
<transcript>: Pretty excited about it. And I think dax is gonna start streaming right after me. So if you like watching dax stream as I do, you'll get to see him right after me. Streaming.

11:40:16
<transcript>: I'm not gonna hold him to that. I don't know if he's doing it every day, but.

11:40:21
<transcript>: I think it's gonna be a thing. Regular cadence.

11:40:26
<transcript>: All right.

11:40:26
<transcript>: viji

11:40:29
<transcript>: Viji. You basically want to create a network of first streamers exactly.

11:40:29
<transcript>: it's like a oh

11:40:32
<transcript>: It's like a oh, it's like a TV network.

11:40:32
<transcript>: for dev

11:40:34
<transcript>: For dev, streamers.

11:40:39
<transcript>: Oh, man, I'm thinking about all kinds of dot TV domains.

11:40:41
<transcript>: Oh no.

11:40:42
vighi_: Love this blur effect

11:40:43
<transcript>: Resistance.

11:40:43
<transcript>: to start

11:40:46
<transcript>: To start searching for domains.

11:40:46
<transcript>: resist

11:40:48
<transcript>: Resisting the urge.

11:40:51
<transcript>: urgent

11:40:52
<transcript>: Urgent.

11:40:52
<transcript>: okay

11:40:54
<transcript>: Okay. Moving on.

11:40:54
<transcript>: let's

11:40:56
<transcript>: Let's do something.

11:41:06
<transcript>: So that's still running. We're just we are setting up mba right now. I've got still do all the other sports.

11:41:09
<transcript>: Still got to do all the other sports.

11:41:16
<transcript>: And I still got to fix all these pre white space issues.

11:41:16
<transcript>: so

11:41:24
<transcript>: So let's see. Everything looks good here. I'm just trying to make sure I'm catching everything that I'm getting all the real data in place.

11:41:27
raondev: i want your light with your name !

11:41:28
<transcript>: So that one right there.

11:41:31
<transcript>: That is going to be something else.

11:41:34
<transcript>: What is that.

11:41:37
<transcript>: Is that the.

11:41:41
<transcript>: Quarter. Oh, that's just a static one.

11:41:41
<transcript>: yeah

11:41:43
<transcript>: Yeah, that's just static.

11:41:46
<transcript>: That's actually static. Okay.

11:41:46
<transcript>: but

11:41:52
<transcript>: But that's not the 29. This is something. This is like a first quarter score or something. Yeah.

11:42:01
<transcript>: I don't think that one is dynamic. I think that's gonna be let's see this will be like home team or a way team, away team.

11:42:01
<transcript>: dot

11:42:02
<transcript>: Dot.

11:42:10
<transcript>: Score. Dot? Nope. How do I get their quarter by quarter? Score is the question.

11:42:14
<transcript>: That's gonna be somewhere else. Okay.

11:42:26
<transcript>: So interesting that I left off here on the first challenge. Ray On, welcome to Chat. I want your light with your name. Oh, the Adam dev. Yeah, my wife got me that for.

11:42:26
<transcript>: a birthday

11:42:28
<transcript>: A birthday. I think.

11:42:34
<transcript>: Okay, so we got to find a place.

11:42:41
<transcript>: That has this data in it. And I think it's gonna be let's see.

11:42:41
<transcript>: box score

11:42:42
<transcript>: Box Score data.

11:42:42
<transcript>: has a home

11:42:48
<transcript>: Has a home team and away team so there's also going to be additional boxcore data stuff.

11:42:48
<transcript>: like

11:42:49
<transcript>: Like.

11:42:52
<transcript>: Const.

11:42:53
<transcript>: constord

11:42:53
<transcript>: constord data

11:42:55
<transcript>: Constord data dot.

11:42:57
<transcript>: Let's see what else we got.

11:42:57
<transcript>: summary

11:42:58
<transcript>: Summary.

11:42:58
<transcript>: might be

11:43:00
<transcript>: Might be grid.

11:43:03
<transcript>: Type home team.

11:43:06
<transcript>: Detail completed game status.

11:43:09
<transcript>: So let's see, team detail.

11:43:12
<transcript>: A weight team.

11:43:12
<transcript>: dot

11:43:13
<transcript>: Dot.

11:43:13
<transcript>: away

11:43:15
<transcript>: Awayteam.

11:43:15
<transcript>: so we have

11:43:18
<transcript>: So we have quarterby quarterstaps.

11:43:18
<transcript>: no

11:43:19
<transcript>: No.

11:43:21
itssupermatix: !dotfiles

11:43:21
fossabot: Adam's dotfiles live here: https://github.com/adamelmore/dotfiles

11:43:24
<transcript>: Let's see.

11:43:31
<transcript>: Thanks so much for the follow viji.

11:43:32
<transcript>: I'm Ree.

11:43:32
<transcript>: is

11:43:34
<transcript>: Is a grid. Right.

11:43:41
<transcript>: But it might be it might be the right thing.

11:43:44
<transcript>: Aggregation.

11:43:47
<transcript>: Might be the summary.

11:43:47
<transcript>: let's just

11:43:51
<transcript>: Let's just look the page. What does this look like? It could be the summary.

11:43:55
<transcript>: It could be.

11:44:00
<transcript>: Oh, if it is.

11:44:00
<transcript>: well

11:44:03
<transcript>: Well, I guess they the table looks different.

11:44:03
<transcript>: than our norm

11:44:07
<transcript>: Than our normal tables. But if that's the summer.

11:44:10
<transcript>: Let's just try rendering it. Let's just try this.

11:44:10
<transcript>: okay

11:44:11
<transcript>: Okay.

11:44:11
<transcript>: back

11:44:13
<transcript>: Back down here.

11:44:16
<transcript>: Let's just try.

11:44:24
<transcript>: Because I had 27. I'm just trying to put it back out with let's just try adding.

11:44:26
<transcript>: A grid. Right here.

11:44:26
<transcript>: brid

11:44:28
<transcript>: Bridge.

11:44:32
<transcript>: And is it data.

11:44:37
<transcript>: Yeah.

11:44:39
<transcript>: Data equals.

11:44:42
<transcript>: Box Score data.

11:44:42
<transcript>: summary

11:44:43
<transcript>: Summary.

11:44:46
<transcript>: Let's see what's.

11:44:51
<transcript>: From The Show Me State, we.

11:44:51
<transcript>: look like

11:44:52
dore95: Very cool website. How does NBA players pictures are generated ?

11:44:54
<transcript>: Look like. Okay. So that is what it is.

11:44:58
<transcript>: That is where the data is. The question is.

11:45:05
<transcript>: The question is, Do I care about the styling? So let's move it out here and that'll help.

11:45:10
<transcript>: And let's add this class to it.

11:45:10
<transcript>: oh

11:45:12
<transcript>: Oh, Well, The Clash is do it.

11:45:15
<transcript>: That just makes the.

11:45:19
<transcript>: Oh, that's not even where it goes.

11:45:19
<transcript>: because

11:45:22
<transcript>: Because this all this stuff. All this stuff. Right.

11:45:29
<transcript>: All of it.

11:45:31
<transcript>: Yeah, I think all of this.

11:45:36
<transcript>: So if I add this class to it. No. Let's just do this.

11:45:39
<transcript>: Invisible.

11:45:51
<transcript>: Or maybe that just needs to be the class. Let's just do this class.

11:46:00
<transcript>: And then let's just move it up here.

11:46:04
<transcript>: Okay. Not looking better.

11:46:04
<transcript>: probably

11:46:10
<transcript>: Probably looking worse. I think we need to. Okay. What do we need to do here.

11:46:18
stormix_co: chat, is he using tailwind?

11:46:25
nzlaura: how're you finding astro & island architecture?

11:46:30
<transcript>: Very cool website. How did NBA players pictures are generated? It's actually an illustrator named Michael Waltchuck. I need to add a fossil bot that was one of my forgot to do. I'm gonna add this right now.

11:46:34
<transcript>: Stamp Museum. Let's just do this. Create.

11:46:38
<transcript>: How would I want to name it players.

11:46:42
<transcript>: Illustrations.

11:46:44
<transcript>: Fixers.

11:46:46
<transcript>: Pictures.

11:46:46
<transcript>: what else

11:46:49
<transcript>: What else would people ask.

11:46:55
<transcript>: The player illustrations.

11:46:55
<transcript>: on

11:47:00
<transcript>: On statmeud.com are illustrated by the.

11:47:02
<transcript>: Magnificent.

11:47:04
<transcript>: Michael.

11:47:04
<transcript>: walt

11:47:05
<transcript>: Waltok.

11:47:05
<transcript>: and

11:47:08
<transcript>: And I'm gonna put his website.

11:47:17
<transcript>: So Michael has worked at Statmeus for, like eight years. And he draws all the photos you see on sami.com.

11:47:24
dore95: Thank you

11:47:26
<transcript>: There we go. We got a command for it now. Just trying to keep fossa bought up and add these things when I think about them.

11:47:26
<transcript>: how are you

11:47:30
<transcript>: How are you finding astro and island architecture in Z? I'm loving it.

11:47:33
<transcript>: I'm loving it.

11:47:33
<transcript>: i will say

11:47:37
<transcript>: I will say I've not even used the island architecture yet we're not doing any.

11:47:37
<transcript>: client

11:47:47
<transcript>: Client side stuff yet. It's all just been server rendered. There will be some interactivity that I get to eventually here, but I haven't done it yet so.

11:47:52
<transcript>: Okay. I want to style this thing. Let's see.

11:47:53
llebc: Morning Adam!

11:47:59
<transcript>: So that's how that one styled? I'm just gonna say what if we just said.

11:48:04
<transcript>: It's full.

11:48:09
<transcript>: What's wrong with this.

11:48:13
<transcript>: I mean the lot wrong with it, I think. But what's.

11:48:13
<transcript>: py

11:48:16
<transcript>: Py. Of you okay.

11:48:27
<transcript>: Is it just in the wrong container for one thing. Oh, so let's get rid of the border.

11:48:37
icedcoffefe: hi adam hello chat

11:48:40
<transcript>: And then the summary. Obviously, that title needs to go away.

11:48:45
<transcript>: Why did we go flex? I guess all of these styles just in it go away.

11:48:48
<transcript>: Okay. So that's better.

11:48:48
<transcript>: sex

11:48:52
<transcript>: Sex was a problem. So if I just remove the title.

11:48:58
<transcript>: Can I override the title here.

11:49:04
<transcript>: Let's see. Let's go to the grid component.

11:49:06
<transcript>: Grid.

11:49:11
<transcript>: I forgot how to use there we go.

11:49:18
<transcript>: See? Full width title. Hide title. There's a hide title. Okay, what am I doing.

11:49:20
<transcript>: Hi title.

11:49:26
<transcript>: Hide title.

11:49:30
<transcript>: Okay. So that's looking.

11:49:35
<transcript>: Okay, ignore the thing below it. That's the fake data.

11:49:35
<transcript>: it's looking

11:49:40
<transcript>: It's looking okay, but it doesn't look as good as the handcrafted one, because.

11:49:40
<transcript>: all the column

11:49:47
<transcript>: All the columns shouldn't be stretched out like that. They should all be kind of like, right aligned. So that's a problem.

11:49:56
<transcript>: Good Morning, Lib.

11:49:58
<transcript>: And ice coffee is here.

11:50:05
<transcript>: I could use some real carfie this morning that daylight savings am alright I've got the the fake coffee right now.

11:50:08
<transcript>: My dandy blend.

11:50:13
<transcript>: I wish there were real caffeine in it. I would enjoy that this morning.

11:50:17
<transcript>: I would.

11:50:17
<transcript>: i would i would

11:50:22
<transcript>: I would I would, so I guess I'm gonna just actually pull this data out.

11:50:29
<transcript>: We're gonna pull the data out and kind of make a custom table here because this one's style differently. Also.

11:50:29
<transcript>: consistency

11:50:32
<transcript>: Consistency wise. I don't love that.

11:50:37
<transcript>: I don't love the stylistically. We have this totally different.

11:50:39
<transcript>: Set of styles here.

11:50:47
<transcript>: Like this is just a personal preference of mine. But like this page stands alone on status. There's no status. Page.

11:50:47
<transcript>: that

11:50:52
<transcript>: That is styled like this. Like if you go to a team page.

11:50:55
<transcript>: Here's the mavericks Team page.

11:50:55
<transcript>: there's no part

11:50:57
<transcript>: There's no part of this page.

11:50:57
<transcript>: that

11:51:00
<transcript>: That looks like that. You know, I mean like these.

11:51:00
<transcript>: tables look like

11:51:02
<transcript>: Tables look like this.

11:51:02
<transcript>: you

11:51:03
<transcript>: You go to stats.

11:51:03
<transcript>: the table

11:51:05
<transcript>: The tables look like this.

11:51:07
<transcript>: It's just.

11:51:24
<transcript>: It's a unique styling that we chose for this. And it's because it came from our mobile app. We did game recaps on mobile first, and then we brought them over to the Web, and they just kind of looked different. So I wonder if I should just take this opportunity to kind of consolidate the styling language.

11:51:24
<transcript>: and

11:51:29
<transcript>: And just make this grid look a little better, like, write a line, all the columns.

11:51:29
<transcript>: but not

11:51:32
<transcript>: But not try and go with this style.

11:51:32
<transcript>: i don't know

11:51:34
<transcript>: I don't know. What do we think? You may have a preference.

11:51:34
<transcript>: i'm matching

11:51:41
<transcript>: I'm matching my asking Twitch yet if you all want to help me design the reread and statmes.com.

11:51:49
<transcript>: We may be hiring David to work with us at statmes.

11:51:49
<transcript>: pabli

11:51:52
<transcript>: Pablio, thanks so much for the follow.

11:51:52
<transcript>: david

11:51:54
<transcript>: David, My designer friend? David.

11:52:00
<transcript>: Not sure where that landed.

11:52:05
<transcript>: So what do we think? This grid.

11:52:05
<transcript>: styling

11:52:11
<transcript>: Styling, or the new grid. Styling are the old, the way it was styled here.

11:52:16
<transcript>: I don't know, I don't know what's it looks like on other sports.

11:52:21
<transcript>: I don't know.

11:52:24
<transcript>: I.

11:52:28
<transcript>: Super bowl box score. So it looks like the same. Yeah.

11:52:41
<transcript>: I guess all this. This is also styled more consistently with this stuff. Yeah. Maybe I should just leave it and we'll have David or somebody help us.

11:52:41
<transcript>: get

11:52:43
<transcript>: Get the styling.

11:52:45
<transcript>: All more consistent.

11:52:45
<transcript>: okay

11:52:53
<transcript>: Okay. So we're gonna go with this style. We're going to just get the data out and plug it into this table.

11:52:58
<transcript>: So let's see Box for summary.

11:53:05
<transcript>: This interesting how this is done. It's not done as a table.

11:53:12
<transcript>: Like it's just divs.

11:53:14
<transcript>: I should be a table. Right.

11:53:17
<transcript>: Grid as a table, isn't it.

11:53:20
<transcript>: Hey.

11:53:23
<transcript>: Is grid a table? I don't even remember.

11:53:27
<transcript>: Yeah, feels like it should be a table.

11:53:27
<transcript>: at least

11:53:29
<transcript>: At least right.

11:53:31
stormix_co: Tables are a nightmare to style tho

11:53:35
<transcript>: It's kind of weird to do that. It's just hard in markup to, like, write it.

11:53:35
<transcript>: table

11:53:44
<transcript>: Tables are not like, yeah, I guess they are, but I've already got one styled, so I'm biased. This is hard to like dinner.

11:53:53
<transcript>: This layout dynamically because you've got a column header here and then the data. Maybe it's not hard. Maybe not. Let's just try.

11:53:57
<transcript>: So here inside of this thing we're gonna do.

11:54:01
<transcript>: A dynamic block here that says Box Score data.

11:54:03
stormix_co: Give it a try you never know

11:54:05
<transcript>: Yeah. Summary map? Yeah, just like this.

11:54:07
<transcript>: Pilot coming through.

11:54:11
<transcript>: What's summary is it? Summary.

11:54:15
<transcript>: No Summary dot.

11:54:15
<transcript>: column

11:54:17
<transcript>: Columns.

11:54:21
<transcript>: Columns Map Hollywood.

11:54:21
<transcript>: okay

11:54:22
<transcript>: Okay.

11:54:31
<transcript>: Then we're gonna put something like this.

11:54:35
<transcript>: In that column.

11:54:35
<transcript>: of each column

11:54:44
<transcript>: Of each column, we're gonna render the column and the values from the rows. This is gonna be a little weird. I don't know. A little weird.

11:54:44
<transcript>: things are just

11:54:47
<transcript>: Things are just follow feisty lobsters.

11:54:50
<transcript>: It's gonna be a little weird.

11:54:50
<transcript>: give it

11:54:53
<transcript>: Give it a try you never know okay.

11:54:57
<transcript>: We're doing it.

11:54:57
<transcript>: so

11:55:00
<transcript>: So that I know what team would be.

11:55:03
<transcript>: Team would be column.

11:55:05
<transcript>: Title.

11:55:08
<transcript>: That should work.

11:55:08
<transcript>: and

11:55:10
<transcript>: And then.

11:55:15
ghostyx101: Bruh fucc tables

11:55:15
<transcript>: This is the part I don't know like the contents here.

11:55:23
<transcript>: Some of them will be Anchor Tags. Most of them will not.

11:55:25
<transcript>: Let's see how.

11:55:25
<transcript>: these are just

11:55:28
<transcript>: These are just bolded scores.

11:55:33
<transcript>: So if it's an entity. Okay. Okay. I know what to do.

11:55:33
<transcript>: why are

11:55:36
<transcript>: Why are those all say team, though.

11:55:40
<transcript>: Is all say team.

11:55:44
<transcript>: Go see not a fan of tables.

11:55:50
<transcript>: Okay. So if they're not okay, here we go.

11:55:50
<transcript>: so

11:55:53
<transcript>: So the insides of this thing.

11:55:58
<transcript>: Semi bold.

11:56:00
<transcript>: Okay.

11:56:00
<transcript>: so this

11:56:03
<transcript>: So this is an anchor tag. If.

11:56:05
<transcript>: If column.

11:56:07
<transcript>: Type.

11:56:10
<transcript>: Oh, it's just a string.

11:56:13
<transcript>: Thought this would be a.

11:56:19
<transcript>: Thought that would be something richer than a string.

11:56:24
<transcript>: Oh, man.

11:56:39
<transcript>: Columns have a type string.

11:56:39
<transcript>: and then down

11:56:43
<transcript>: And then down here. Oh, we have an entity on the actual record, so. Okay, okay.

11:56:47
<transcript>: I know what to do.

11:56:47
<transcript>: i know what to do

11:56:48
<transcript>: I know what to do.

11:56:51
<transcript>: Is subverted.

11:56:55
<transcript>: Instead of this, it's gonna be here. We're gonna say.

11:56:55
<transcript>: box

11:56:57
<transcript>: Boxcore data.

11:56:59
<transcript>: What did I just do.

11:56:59
<transcript>: oh that might be

11:57:01
<transcript>: Oh, that might be right.

11:57:04
<transcript>: Copilot says this.

11:57:07
<transcript>: And that might be right.

11:57:12
<transcript>: So let's just humor me here. This is gonna be.

11:57:17
<transcript>: Summary Summary Rose Map right.

11:57:18
<transcript>: And we get the.

11:57:18
<transcript>: value

11:57:20
<transcript>: Value.

11:57:25
<transcript>: Let's see.

11:57:28
<transcript>: Row, dot.

11:57:30
<transcript>: There really a Dot sells.

11:57:30
<transcript>: where's my

11:57:32
<transcript>: Where's my typescript.

11:57:39
<transcript>: Row? Oh, Here we go. Display.

11:57:39
<transcript>: value

11:57:40
<transcript>: Value.

11:57:40
<transcript>: okay

11:57:45
<transcript>: Okay. So it would just be like, value unless there's an entity.

11:57:47
<transcript>: So.

11:57:47
<transcript>: entity

11:57:48
<transcript>: Entity.

11:57:56
<transcript>: If there's an entity, we're gonna do that thing else we're gonna just do row value. Yeah.

11:57:59
<transcript>: Like that. And this won't be the.

11:58:03
m4z4f4k4: what vim it is?

11:58:04
<transcript>: Road name.

11:58:07
m4z4f4k4: spacevim?

11:58:10
<transcript>: Display name? What was it? Why am I not getting typescript? It's really annoying.

11:58:14
<transcript>: What, then? Is it? It is neovem.

11:58:16
<transcript>: Display name.

sockenguy: They use Ruby in the backend

11:59:15
<transcript>: They explain themselves. They use ruby in the back end. Okay.

11:59:17
<transcript>: Build doesn't really make sense.

11:59:17
<transcript>: this is

11:59:19
sockenguy: and in some parts of the frontend, yeaah

11:59:19
<transcript>: This is a front and roll.

11:59:22
<transcript>: okay

11:59:23
sockenguy: feels weird

11:59:25
<transcript>: Okay. If it's pretty small, then I guess.

<transcript>: it's

12:00:05

<transcript>: Row.

12:00:16
<transcript>: column

12:00:17
<transcript>: Column.

<transcript>: Row item key. So we're just getting the value for this column from the row.

12:00:27
<transcript>: What's wrong? What's wrong with this? Oh, it could be undefined.

12:00:27
<transcript>: now

12:00:29
<transcript>: Now we know it's, we know it's a thing.

12:00:36
<transcript>: We know it's there because we did a checkup here. Why did that? Not when Touch got tightscale. And I figured that out.

12:00:36

itssupermatix: @Kryotoboi WutFace

12:01:27
<transcript>: I think we did it.

12:01:29
<transcript>: Wait, wait.

12:01:36
<transcript>: Is it all bolded? Should it be bolded? Okay, let's just get rid of the other stuff and see what it looks like.

12:01:45
<transcript>: We did it.

12:01:54
<transcript>: Look at that. Look at it, people. We did it.

12:01:57
<transcript>: We did it and it looks exactly right.

12:02:07
<transcript>: Exactly. Do you see that? Watch this grid. Watch. It not change when we go to the live site and then we toggle back to the fake site. Live.

12:02:07
<transcript>: rewritten

12:02:12
<transcript>: Rewritten live rewritten ignore the language change that's normal.

12:02:16
<transcript>: Nothing to see here. Oh, this little guy. Don't worry about this little guy.

12:02:25
<transcript>: Okay. There's. The language is at least the same on this one. It's different every time you ask the question, that's all.

12:02:32
<transcript>: We got kairi and luca, look at me, knowing stuff about sports. Still.

12:02:32
<transcript>: i can't believe i just

12:02:37
<transcript>: I can't believe I just nailed that grid. First try, first try.

12:02:38
<transcript>: Okay.

12:02:46
<transcript>: So nothing changes. So we got the whole top section. This is all done. Everything you see here is the.

12:02:50
<transcript>: Now we need to do this thing down here.

12:02:55
<transcript>: Which I'm less excited about.

12:03:01
<transcript>: So I'm gonna do these as separate pages, actually not make it a spa like it is now.

12:03:01
<transcript>: oh

12:03:05
stroopwafel26: g'day

12:03:13
kryotoboi: If you give this to the QA on my team, he would cry about the missing the placeholder on the search and block the story WutFace

12:03:14
<transcript>: Oh, the ads. We have ads on St now, which we got to. We're growing up. We're a business. Stroop is here. Which keyboard are you using? The 80 or 65? I'm using an 80 right now.

12:03:14
<transcript>: i'm using

12:03:27
<transcript>: I'm using my my 80 with dracula keycaps. It just feels real nice. It's just got a totally different field than my sonnet. I go back and forth. I don't really use my 65s. They're mostly for display purposes only.

12:03:40
<transcript>: But I go back and forth between my 80 and a sonnet, the sun. It just is a lot firmer. It's just the choice of components, like I could make a Saunit that feels probably just like this dracula or this 80.

12:03:42
<transcript>: But.

12:03:42
<transcript>: yeah

12:03:52
sockenguy: @Kryotoboi Wish we would have QA LUL

12:04:01
<transcript>: Yeah, this one is just like it's really pleasant to type on. I like my sonet, too, but I like this one better if you give this to the qa on my team, he would cry about the missing the placeholder on the search and block the story. Oh, well, yeah, I'm not quite done. I mean, ignore everything in the header up here. This is all fake. Ignore everything you see up here.

12:04:01
<transcript>: but everything

12:04:05
<transcript>: But everything below that that's all real.

12:04:05
<transcript>: so

12:04:10
<transcript>: So now what we're gonna do is we're gonna make a separate page for team stats.

12:04:15
<transcript>: Team stats and player stats are separate pages.

12:04:15
<transcript>: and how does

12:04:22
<transcript>: And how does he render the I say he how did we render these? I don't know who did this work.

12:04:24
<transcript>: Probably Eric.

12:04:30

12:05:48
<transcript>: The ball was low.

12:05:56
<transcript>: Team stats, players.

12:05:59
<transcript>: So down here we got all this data.

<transcript>: How we've render in this.

<transcript>: Okay, so team stats, players, status. I bet the data lives. Let's see.

12:07:10

12:10:12
<transcript>: No, that's right. Sons.

12:10:12
<transcript>: oh because that

12:10:20
<transcript>: Oh, because that date is fake. It's from a different game, and this is gonna be homekeep. Home team. Dot name? Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.

12:10:27
<transcript>: I'm trying to lose the habit to get the phone to bed with me. Yeah.

12:10:27
<transcript>: yeah we

12:10:34
<transcript>: Yeah, we do that. My wife and I get in bed and look at, like, tick Tok together. I just watch her Tik Tok but like.

12:10:39
<transcript>: Can I just say this? People who can process tiktoks.

12:10:39
<transcript>: you have a different

12:10:52
<transcript>: You have a different brain than me. Like it's so fast, the amount of text on the screen, trying to figure out what's going on, like my wife can, like, skin through five Tik toks and I still haven't figured out what the first one is about. Like I'm so slow to process it.

12:10:52
<transcript>: it takes me

12:11:12
<transcript>: It takes me so long to read, like, the text pops up and I'm trying to read it. Then there's, like, more context I'm missing. And I don't know any of the trends, so I don't get to, like, tell her to slow down. No, I just get to watch her watch TikTok, and I catch some of it and some of it's funny. But, like, mostly I don't I don't give feedback. She doesn't want to, like, mess up her algorithm because I'm like, Let's.

12:11:12
<transcript>: watch that one again

12:11:15
<transcript>: Watch that one again because I didn't get it the first time.

12:11:26
<transcript>: Okay, so this is the product I was talking about. This is just gonna be hard coded, feels so good. This is gonna be really easy, actually, this is just gonna be a way team that feels.

12:11:26
<transcript>: that

12:11:30
<transcript>: That stat? Team stat. With what is it.

12:11:30
<transcript>: so it's gonna

12:11:33
<transcript>: So it's gonna be so easy? Box score data.

12:11:33
<transcript>: dot

12:11:34
<transcript>: Dot.

12:11:36
<transcript>: Team detail.

12:11:37
<transcript>: Dot.

12:11:37
<transcript>: wait

12:11:39
<transcript>: Waiting.

12:11:39
<transcript>: there we go

12:11:41
<transcript>: There we go.

12:11:42
<transcript>: Build.

12:11:44
juniornascm: Tiktok is bad beacause "train" you brain to be super stimulated, what you brain loves! So when you try to do something less "stimulant" you kinda can't concentrate

12:11:45
<transcript>: Something.

12:11:45
<transcript>: field goal what

12:11:47
<transcript>: Field goal. What does this one feel? Gold made.

12:12:08
stroopwafel26: I'm one of those people that ponders the meaning of life when I try to fall asleep, so I use my phone to get my mind to think of something else so I can actually sleep :')

12:12:08

<transcript>: Hometeam and then same thing here for a way team.

12:12:39
<transcript>: Awaiting.

12:12:43
<transcript>: Away team okay.

12:12:48
<transcript>: Now, back down here. This can just be let's see.

12:12:51
<transcript>: Was it awaiting.

12:12:51
<transcript>: way team

12:12:52
bronifty: Do you mess around with AWS CDK at all Adam ?

12:12:53
<transcript>: Way. Team stats.

12:12:53
juniornascm: i will never get tired of the smooth camera transition

12:12:56
<transcript>: And I can do this same thing. But with.

12:13:01
<transcript>: Home team staff. We did it. Look at that.

12:13:01
<transcript>: look

12:13:05
<transcript>: Look at that. Look at that. We did it.

12:13:05
<transcript>: so now

12:13:08
<transcript>: So now both of those values are correct.

12:13:11
<transcript>: Okay, I'm just gonna scroll all the way down.

12:13:23
<transcript>: Why there's so many more stats on this one. Something. I've broke something in the markup, I guess. Okay, next up, feel go, percentage. This is gonna be so easy. Like I'm getting this thing done today.

12:13:27
<transcript>: Let's do.

12:13:30
<transcript>: Let's do field gold main.

12:13:30
<transcript>: field

12:13:32
<transcript>: Field goal percent.

12:13:35
<transcript>: Right. And then.

12:13:40
<transcript>: Home theme okay.

12:13:48
<transcript>: Do you mess around with aws cdk at all? Adam Bronifty. Yes. I did a lot of cdk work before I discovered.

12:13:48
<transcript>: sst

12:13:55
<transcript>: Sst. So I use ss T now, but before that I was just using cdk for every project. Yeah.

12:13:58
<transcript>: Let's see.

12:14:01
<transcript>: Tiktok is bad because.

12:14:01
<transcript>: train your

12:14:07
<transcript>: Train your brain to be super stimulated what your brain loves. So when you try to do something less stimulant, you kind of can't concentrate.

12:14:13
<transcript>: That makes sense. This is why the video is now has subway suffer surfers in the bottom.

12:14:13
<transcript>: what's the sub

12:14:15
<transcript>: What's the subway suffer.

12:14:30
<transcript>: I'm one of those people that ponders the meaning of life when I try to fall asleep. So I use my phone to get my mind to think of something else so I can actually sleep. Yeah. My wife has a really hard time falling asleep.

12:14:35
<transcript>: Tik Tok I think helps that I think.

12:14:44
<transcript>: I can feel that. Been there. Okay. I will never get tired of the smooth camera transition. Was it like the moving camera? Did it go to the moving cameras? That we mean.

12:14:46
juniornascm: Subway sufers is that game waht the boy avoid trains.

12:14:47
stroopwafel26: i'm on reddit a lot

12:14:50
<transcript>: It's fun just to watch the camera on the rig just moving around over there.

12:14:55
<transcript>: A little distracting, but it's worth it. It's worth it for the production value.

12:14:55
<transcript>: okay

12:14:57
<transcript>: Okay.

12:14:57
<transcript>: three

12:14:59
<transcript>: Three point made. Attempted.

12:14:59
<transcript>: this is

12:15:01
<transcript>: This is gonna be.

12:15:03
<transcript>: Away.

12:15:03
<transcript>: and this

12:15:05
<transcript>: And this is gonna be.

12:15:09
daeeyy: listening to podcasts helps me get to sleep

<transcript>: Oh, I missed one.

12:15:34
trivenge: need for speed SeemsGood

12:15:35
daeeyy: I have to listen to a podcast 5 times before completely getting it though, as I fall asleep quite fast

12:15:36
<transcript>: 3%.

12:15:42
<transcript>: Look at us, go, look at us, go.

12:15:42
<transcript>: okay

12:15:44
<transcript>: Okay free throw made.

12:15:47
<transcript>: madeeen stats

12:15:48
<transcript>: Madeeen stats.

12:15:48
<transcript>: and then

12:15:50
<transcript>: And then.

12:15:54
<transcript>: Free thread.

12:15:56
<transcript>: Attempt.

12:15:59
juniornascm: @icedcoffefe the videos from reddit with voice and minecraft parkour

12:16:00
<transcript>: Oh, what's this? The other team does not have one.

12:16:00
<transcript>: they just

12:16:02
<transcript>: They just not have any free throws.

12:16:04
<transcript>: What.

12:16:04
<transcript>: does it attempt

12:16:06
<transcript>: Does it attempt any free throws.

12:16:10
<transcript>: That's bad guys. You should attempt free throws. They're important.

12:16:13
<transcript>: Free throw. Made. Attempted.

12:16:18
<transcript>: Freezer management. Oh, this is where I've broken all of these.

12:16:22
icedcoffefe: with AI voices

12:16:24
<transcript>: Is where I must have somehow deleted a whole lot of markup.

12:16:24
<transcript>: now i

12:16:26
<transcript>: Now I got a copy. More markup.

12:16:32
<transcript>: Okay, let's do that. Pre. Three made a Sam. Tell me. Okay.

12:16:32
<transcript>: so here's

12:16:37
<transcript>: So here's what we're gonna do. I guess I could just copy. I think it's just, like, the same.

12:16:49
<transcript>: Markup all the way down. But no, this is different. Right here. Right off its rebounds. It changes. Okay, so let's do this. Let's just inspect free throw percentage.

12:16:51
juniornascm: theres a woman that read them i think, her voice is really relaxing to me

12:16:52
<transcript>: Let's just copy all of these.

12:16:55
<transcript>: I have to do it one by one.

12:16:58
<transcript>: It's kind of a bummer.

12:16:59
structuredchris: are all the rows gonna be keys in homeTeamStats/awayTeamStats? why not map the object keys or smth, sorry you probs hate backseat devs but curious why hardcode

12:17:00
juniornascm: cant remember her name tho

12:17:01
<transcript>: Kind of a bummer.

12:17:01
<transcript>: but

12:17:03
<transcript>: But.

12:17:06
<transcript>: It's better than typing all of that. I guess.

12:17:13
<transcript>: Minecraft parkour is better.

12:17:16
<transcript>: Oh like for falling asleep.

12:17:19
<transcript>: Subway.

12:17:19
<transcript>: suffers

12:17:25
<transcript>: Suffers? Is that game? What the boy avoid trains. I've never seen this.

12:17:25
<transcript>: listen

12:17:29
<transcript>: Listen to podcasts. Helps me get to sleep. Yeah, my wife's somethings. The stuff, too.

12:17:39
<transcript>: Triv is here. I have to look into the podcast five times before completely getting it, though. As if I fall. Sit quite fast. I fall asleep really fast.

12:17:52
<transcript>: There's a woman that it read them. I think her voice is really relaxing to me. Welcome to Chat Structured. Chris. Are all the rows gonna be keys in that thing? Why not mapped the object keys? Oh, my word.

12:17:52
<transcript>: well

12:17:55
<transcript>: Well, yes and no.

12:17:55
icedcoffefe: have yall seen the joe biden and donald trump AI minecraft server

12:17:58
<transcript>: We don't have the title anywhere in the data.

12:17:58
<transcript>: so

12:18:01
<transcript>: So the title I don't have.

12:18:06
<transcript>: That's a good point, though. It does feel like a lot of like redundant markup.

12:18:07
structuredchris: title === key

12:18:09
<transcript>: Sorry. You probably hate backseat. I do not actually.

12:18:09
<transcript>: so let me

12:18:10
structuredchris: but format

12:18:11
daglee: I tried to read Barack Obamas book in bed. 3 years and I have red 100 pages.

12:18:13
<transcript>: So let me tell you something structured let me tell you a little story.

12:18:13
<transcript>: i stream on

12:18:15
<transcript>: I stream on twitch because.

12:18:15
<transcript>: you

12:18:17
texoport: I just listen to random lectures on Youtube. I either find a new rabbithole that'll keep me up or night or something that'll put me to sleep in 5 minutes

12:18:26
juniornascm: You can just make an object with the title as well, like @structuredchris said

12:18:27
texoport: all night*

12:18:29
<transcript>: You guys in twitch chat help me accomplish a lot more than I can accomplish by myself. I wouldn't know how to use them if it weren't for twitch chat. Like I started using vim on twitch, and if I weren't prefer people like cafes, I would have never learned it.

12:18:29
<transcript>: so

12:18:31
<transcript>: So I love.

12:18:31
<transcript>: backseat

12:18:34
juniornascm: seems a really good idea

12:18:37
<transcript>: Backseat devs. I encourage back to I would prefer you guys set in the front if I'm being honest.

12:18:49
<transcript>: Let's see. Can't remember her name, though I think the only problem is I don't have the I don't have the titles. So this right here. This title. Free throw percentage. That's just hard coded. As far as I can tell, it's not in the day.

12:18:53
<transcript>: Right. I'm in the data. Right. Home. Team. Staff.

12:18:54
structuredchris: the title is the key but format it

12:18:56
<transcript>: It's not in this data.

12:18:58
structuredchris: ?

12:18:59
jobnbackpack: Hi Adam. It‚Äôs been a long time since the last time I looked into the stream.

12:19:00
<transcript>: But I should make sure because this is a great point.

12:19:00
<transcript>: let's see

12:19:02
<transcript>: Let's see.

12:19:02
<transcript>: camera

12:19:03
<transcript>: Camera.

12:19:03
<transcript>: nb

12:19:05
<transcript>: Nba Visual or something.

12:19:07
<transcript>: Mba.

12:19:09
<transcript>: Visual.

12:19:17
<transcript>: Here. So is that data anywhere in this mess.

12:19:24
<transcript>: Spring is the team. The player details player detail. So this one now. Yeah, I don't have the data.

12:19:24
<transcript>: the bummer

12:19:26
<transcript>: The bummer.

12:19:28
<transcript>: It is a bummer.

12:19:34
<transcript>: But that is the reality I'm living in. So I think I still have to.

12:19:34
<transcript>: get the tit

12:19:38
<transcript>: Get the titles from somewhere I guess I could like.

12:19:38
<transcript>: i

12:19:43
<transcript>: I could kind of build up my own little object and then just render the markup would be a lot simpler.

12:19:44
jobnbackpack: Whuut my founders badge is gone

12:19:45
<transcript>: Yeah. Let's do that.

12:19:48
uberrick: on tmux did you manuall rename the tab names?

12:19:49
<transcript>: I like that. Because.

12:19:49
<transcript>: if i ever

12:19:54
<transcript>: If I ever want to Restyl it change the styling here. I don't have to do it for every single one of these.

12:19:54
<transcript>: it could have made like

12:19:57
<transcript>: It could have made like a component that would be another option. But.

12:20:00
structuredchris: :)

12:20:04
<transcript>: Have you all seen the Joe Biden and Donald Trump AI minecraft server. I have not.

12:20:04
<transcript>: title

12:20:05
<transcript>: Title equals Q.

12:20:05
<transcript>: format

12:20:07
<transcript>: Format.

12:20:07
<transcript>: i don't think

12:20:11
<transcript>: I don't think that's entirely entirely accurate.

12:20:11
<transcript>: let's just give

12:20:14
<transcript>: Let's just give it a test here.

12:20:14
<transcript>: so

12:20:16
<transcript>: So this one right here.

12:20:19
<transcript>: So this one is.

12:20:19
<transcript>: it's

12:20:21
<transcript>: It's free Throw percentage.

12:20:24
<transcript>: Freeze row per cent.

12:20:27
<transcript>: I mean, it kind of.

12:20:27
<transcript>: like

12:20:32
<transcript>: Like if you just replace Percent with the Percent sign and then.

12:20:39
<transcript>: Case it I guess I get yeah, I guess so. Well, no. Like look at free throw. Made attempted this one right here.

12:20:39
<transcript>: it's got a

12:20:41
<transcript>: It's got a hyphen.

12:20:41
<transcript>: and then

12:20:47
structuredchris: oh yeah shame

12:20:48
<transcript>: And then it's not attempt. It's attempted. It's like little things like that. That ultimately, it's not. It's kind of an arbitrary string.

12:20:53
<transcript>: I tried to read Barack Obama's book in Bed three years. And I've read 100 patients.

12:20:53
<transcript>: i just listen

12:20:55
juniornascm: i not really into astro, but you can make a loop? so you dont have to have to have all this divs.

12:21:01
<transcript>: I just listened to random lectures on YouTube. I either find a new rabbit hole that I'll keep me up for night or something will put me to sleep and find it.

12:21:08
juniornascm: i mean i not really know astro

12:21:09
<transcript>: Yeah, that's what we're gonna do Jr. I think we're gonna we're gonna make an object with the title.

12:21:09
<transcript>: and then render it

12:21:10
<transcript>: And then render it that way.

12:21:16
<transcript>: Hi, Adam. Job is here.

12:21:16
<transcript>: it's been

<transcript>: Can they disappear.

12:21:52
uberrick: might only show when subbed

12:21:53
<transcript>: What would cause that Rick is. I knew Rick was here on tmux. Did you manually rename the tab names? I did. I did that manually.

12:21:53
<transcript>: doesn't

12:21:58
<transcript>: Doesn't prime have like a script he uses for like projects or something.

12:21:58
<transcript>: and

<transcript>: And P. Max.

12:22:04
stroopwafel26: tmux \o/

12:22:05
<transcript>: Yeah, we'll make a loop.

12:22:05
<transcript>: we'll make

12:22:11
jobnbackpack: Don‚Äôt think so. @uberrick might be right

12:22:12
<transcript>: We'll make a loop. We'll just make up our own little object here. That's what we're gonna do. So you don't have to do all it is. Yeah, yeah. It's too much. Markup.

12:22:17
mooosa: yeah he calls it the tmux-sessionizer

12:22:17
<transcript>: When we can do it'll just all run on the server side. It's like PHP.

12:22:27
<transcript>: Oh, wow? Hang on? Hang on? Hang on? Hang on.

12:22:41
trickery89: prime uses this tmux script: https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/blob/master/bin/.local/scripts/tmux-sessionizer

<transcript>: You said that issue where I couldn't give subsid Mount channel. I would like the checkout would not work. Okay, wait, tina. Okay, so here we're gonna make a let's go up here. We're gonna make an object. It's gonna be kind of ugly up here, but.

12:27:07
jobnbackpack: No worries.

12:27:12
<transcript>: Team steps. It's gonna save us some pain, I think.

12:27:16
<transcript>: So should I just do the keys as the titles.

12:27:17
<transcript>: Is that what you want to do.

12:27:20
<transcript>: Keys is titles.

12:27:25
<transcript>: And then have like a home in a way so we could do.

12:27:30
<transcript>: Like this? Let me show you let me show you what I mean.

12:27:34
<transcript>: Field goal made attempted.

12:27:34
<transcript>: like this is

12:27:36
<transcript>: Like this is the title. Maybe.

12:27:39
<transcript>: I'm sorry, the key.

12:27:39
<transcript>: and then

12:27:40
<transcript>: And then.

12:27:42
<transcript>: We have like a home.

12:27:46
<transcript>: Is hometeams that.

12:27:46
<transcript>: sealgo

12:27:48
<transcript>: Sealgo? Yeah like that.

12:27:48
<transcript>: we want it like

12:27:50
<transcript>: We want it like this.

12:27:53
<transcript>: Oh no.

12:27:53
<transcript>: wow

12:27:58
<transcript>: Wow. What would be the easiest way to do this? To build the buildup an object.

12:28:02
<transcript>: I need some of that sweet, sweet, backseat. Devving.

12:28:08
<transcript>: Away a way team set this feels like it's gonna be really tedious here. Now.

12:28:11
<transcript>: But is this the best way to do it.

12:28:16
<transcript>: Then just loop through the keys and the object.

12:28:28
<transcript>: What do we think that's there's a lot of now there's just a lot of like typing here getting all these properties like, I'd love to just spread the properties into the things somehow.

12:28:28
<transcript>: but

12:28:30
<transcript>: But I don't know how I would do that.

12:28:46
<transcript>: Well, I guess I could map the keys to titles so I could do, like comp title map. So overdoing this. But what if we did this? What if we said.

12:28:49
<transcript>: Like that.

12:28:55
trivenge: oh i see your question, does your ninja v  have built in vertical 9:16 guides? most external monitors do. i cant check as i no longer have a ninja v as it was taken yesterday, but might be worth considering. wide lens, shooting with those guides can be a way to frame content for IG for example. since you are using frames in the external monitor to know what it will look like in post, make sure to record at 4k since you are going to crop quite a bit.. 4k or higher. panasonic is ahead in this game

12:28:58
<transcript>: But actually we said field goal made attempt. Like what if we did the we made a map of the titles, and then I could spread through the object.

12:28:58
<transcript>: maybe

12:29:00
<transcript>: Maybe.

12:29:02
<transcript>: You know, I'm saying.

12:29:11
trivenge: where they are offering 4:3 and 5:4 ratios which make things a bit easier in post

12:29:22
<transcript>: Oh, does I see your question? Does your ninja V have builtin vertical nine by 16 guides? Most external monitors do. I can't check because I no longer have an interview as it was taken is day, but might be worth considering. Wide lens shooting with those guides could be a way to frame contribute for ig, for example.

12:29:27
<transcript>: So Trip, I think I actually am okay with my process of filming.

12:29:31
trivenge: oh ok

12:29:33
<transcript>: The video. The video. Like I've got a vertical video. All I want to do.

12:29:33
<transcript>: is

12:29:34
trivenge: its not filming?

12:29:39
juniornascm: i thought you will do something like: { title, team1date, tem2data}

12:29:43
trivenge: OH publish

12:29:45
<transcript>: Is have a way to easily publish it to all the different short form platforms. There's just three of them, but I'd love to just be able to drop my short form vertical video and then like click publish and send it to short read.

12:29:49
<transcript>: That's all. I just want to publish them. Yeah.

12:29:49
<transcript>: that's right

12:29:51
<transcript>: That's right.

12:29:56
<transcript>: Do something like title. Team One, date. Team two. Data.

12:29:56
<transcript>: so

12:30:06
<transcript>: So so that's what I was starting to do here. Right? Like the title is the key of the object and then doing this. But if I do it the other way.

12:30:06
<transcript>: seems that

12:30:07
<transcript>: Seems that.

12:30:07
<transcript>: to

12:30:11
<transcript>: To this is a good learning exercise. If nothing else, then I could do home.

12:30:11
<transcript>: and that's

12:30:13
<transcript>: And that's just like.

12:30:16
<transcript>: Home team stuff.

12:30:21
<transcript>: I don't have to spread it. It is just home team stats. Right.

12:30:24
<transcript>: No, no. What am I talking about.

12:30:24
<transcript>: so

12:30:27
trivenge: my bad, gotcha

12:30:29
<transcript>: So what I do? I would do like I would go over each.

12:30:33
<transcript>: Key of hometeam stats so like this object.

12:30:33
<transcript>: key

12:30:37
<transcript>: Keys of Home Team stats.

12:30:40
<transcript>: Map.

12:30:43
<transcript>: Okay.

12:30:45
<transcript>: Let's.

12:30:45
<transcript>: be

12:30:46
<transcript>: Be spread.

12:30:49
<transcript>: So I'd map key.

12:30:49
<transcript>: and then

12:30:52
<transcript>: And then I'd get the.

12:31:05
<transcript>: Yeah. What would I do here? I would get the so if I've got each key, I would get the title from the title map.

12:31:05
<transcript>: so i would

12:31:10
<transcript>: So I would create a new object and title would be title. Map.

12:31:10
<transcript>: hey

12:31:12
<transcript>: Hey, and then.

12:31:12
<transcript>: home

12:31:14
<transcript>: Home would be.

12:31:14
<transcript>: home

12:31:15
juniornascm: OH ok, i see

12:31:16
<transcript>: Home Team stats.

12:31:16
<transcript>: k

12:31:22
<transcript>: K. And away would be away. Team stats. K. Right.

12:31:23
<transcript>: What's wrong with this.

12:31:26
structuredchris: why not 'FG Made - Attempted': [homeStat, awayStat]? always have home as index 0 or or away as 0 maybe. or are you tryna dynamically create your new object reference?

12:31:32
<transcript>: Idle map. Okay, that's gonna be a string. How's that not clear, okay? Is not.

12:31:32
<transcript>: clearly

12:31:33
juniornascm: k is your object

12:31:34
<transcript>: Clearly a string. What.

12:31:41
<transcript>: I can't use typescript files K is your object.

12:31:41
<transcript>: i'll

12:31:44
<transcript>: I'll the key is something else.

12:31:49
<transcript>: How does this work? When you do object keys.

12:31:53
<transcript>: Subject to keys, a thing.

12:31:54
<transcript>: Wait.

12:31:56
structuredchris: ohh yeaaa you're just being lazier :"D cool

12:31:58
<transcript>: I got a Google hang on.

12:32:01
structuredchris: yeah it returns strings

12:32:05
<transcript>: Object keys. See, this is a problem with Astro in the OVM.

12:32:05
<transcript>: so object

12:32:10
<transcript>: So object our keys is just an array of the keys, right? Yeah, yeah, that's all I wanted.

12:32:12
<transcript>: So.

12:32:15
<transcript>: So that case should just be a string. Right.

12:32:19
<transcript>: Shouldn't have to tell it. I can't even tell it can I.

12:32:21
<transcript>: Let's go.

12:32:25
<transcript>: String cannot be okay title map.

12:32:25
<transcript>: so i

12:32:28
<transcript>: So I can't index title map by K.

12:32:37
<transcript>: What's wrong? Why not feel gold? Maybe it attempted homestat. Oasat always have homes index one. Oh, yeah, that could work. We don't have to.

12:32:40
<transcript>: Yeah. We just we just do an array.

12:32:45
<transcript>: Title. So. Okay, let's do this.

12:32:45
juniornascm: i think you will have to do like: k as keyof teamstats

12:32:47
<transcript>: All over the place.

12:32:50
<transcript>: And by now I could have finished the thing.

12:32:50
<transcript>: but this

12:32:52
<transcript>: But this is a learning exercise.

12:32:55
<transcript>: So here's what we have we have.

12:32:58
<transcript>: Title, map.

12:32:58
<transcript>: pay

12:33:00
<transcript>: Pay, and then.

12:33:00
<transcript>: an array

12:33:03
<transcript>: An array. That is these things.

12:33:06
<transcript>: Home Team stats.

12:33:11
<transcript>: A. Away Team Stats K.

12:33:17
<transcript>: It's just a property. No, I'm mapping. No, no.

12:33:17
structuredchris: but it doesn't adopt typescript, you wanna enforce (object.keys(homeTeamStats) as homeTeamStatsKeyUnion).map

12:33:21
<transcript>: What am I doing here.

12:33:26
<transcript>: Think you have to do like K as kia of teamstats.

12:33:30
<transcript>: Oh oh, good call.

12:33:32
<transcript>: Hey.

12:33:35
<transcript>: I do that like.

12:33:38
<transcript>: As key of like that.

12:33:38
<transcript>: or something

12:33:40
<transcript>: Or something. I can do that.

12:33:47
<transcript>: Oh, that's not gonna exist. No, no, I don't know what I'm doing.

12:33:49
<transcript>: What was I trying to accomplish.

12:33:49
<transcript>: was

12:33:51
<transcript>: Was trying to accomplish.

12:33:55
<transcript>: Just like the simplest way to build up an object.

12:33:55
<transcript>: that has

12:34:05
<transcript>: That has these titles in it. So I just created a title map for every property and then I don't have to redundantly type all this out and maintain this object. I can just have like a thing.

12:34:08
<transcript>: So see things are follow foj.

12:34:19
phojiee: Hello, What IDE is that? is tthat VIM?

12:34:20
<transcript>: But it doesn't adopt typescript. You want to enforce object keys as hometeams. That's key Union map. Oh, I see. Yeah, yeah, object keys.

12:34:20
<transcript>: all i

12:34:25
<transcript>: All I need are the strings out of it, though, right? Like it should at least.

12:34:28
<transcript>: Object that keys returns a string array right.

12:34:32
<transcript>: Hi fog. It is neovem.

12:34:32
<transcript>: all

12:34:34
<transcript>: All I need is the string.

12:34:38
<transcript>: You're saying I don't know, that it's a.

12:34:40
structuredchris: yeh but you cant use the strings afterwards to index the object

12:34:41
juniornascm: i dont think typescript like to index object with strings

12:34:44
<transcript>: It exists in the title map, I guess but if I just said title map is.

12:34:44
<transcript>: a record

12:34:45
<transcript>: A record.

12:34:45
<transcript>: str

12:34:48
<transcript>: String, string, Then we should be happy now.

12:34:48
<transcript>: right

12:34:54
<transcript>: Right. Oh, but I don't know that the K is a property of home team stats. I gotcha.

12:35:00
<transcript>: I got you. Yeah, yeah. So home team stats has a type. And that type is what.

12:35:00
<transcript>: let's

12:35:02
<transcript>: Let's go to it.

12:35:04
<transcript>: Or I'll just do this.

12:35:07
<transcript>: Type.

12:35:11
<transcript>: Team set? Yeah, type of.

12:35:17
<transcript>: Home. Means that. Can I do that.

12:35:22
<transcript>: And then if I say object keys.

12:35:29
<transcript>: Hey, I need to say that K is a.

12:35:32
<transcript>: Key of that type. Right.

12:35:36
<transcript>: Can you actually specify type right here.

12:35:38
<transcript>: That leads.

12:35:44
rsromano: Should the title map have that type declaration on the key?

12:35:46
<transcript>: It. So then I can say this is like some kind of type. Like type.

12:35:47
<transcript>: types key

12:35:47
<transcript>: types key yeah

12:35:48
<transcript>: Types key yeah Yeah.

12:35:59
<transcript>: Seems that key right now. I should be able to do that. No. You have team stats.

12:36:04
<transcript>: Now, can I do this.

12:36:12
<transcript>: We're gonna chat Rs romano should the title map have that type declaration on the key? Oh, yeah, it should.

12:36:12
<transcript>: it should

12:36:14
<transcript>: It should.

12:36:14
<transcript>: it should

12:36:15
<transcript>: It should.

12:36:18
<transcript>: Call.

12:36:18
<transcript>: so

12:36:20
<transcript>: So title, map.

12:36:20
<transcript>: because we're going

12:36:23
<transcript>: Because we're going through each key. No, not.

12:36:23
<transcript>: i

12:36:25
<transcript>: I'm just getting the.

12:36:32
<transcript>: I could make it smarter, we could make it smarter. So the key here is gonna be Team sap ski.

12:36:36
<transcript>: And then the value is just gonna be a string.

12:36:36
<transcript>: right

12:36:37
<transcript>: Right.

12:36:37
<transcript>: missing

12:36:40
<transcript>: Missing. So now it's just telling me I got to add more. That's fine.

12:36:43
<transcript>: That didn't really help me down here.

12:36:48
<transcript>: Okay. I'm actually gonna.

12:36:48
<transcript>: i'm gonna believe

12:36:54
<transcript>: I'm gonna believe it or not, I'm a start over here because this is such a mess. This is what I do in typescript. I'm so lost.

12:36:54
<transcript>: so okay

12:36:55
<transcript>: So okay.

12:36:55
<transcript>: we're

12:36:57
<transcript>: We're gonna spread.

12:36:57
<transcript>: object

12:36:58
<transcript>: Object.

12:36:58
<transcript>: key

12:37:00
<transcript>: Keys.

12:37:04
<transcript>: Of home team.

12:37:08
<transcript>: On teamsats. Okay.

12:37:13
<transcript>: And we're going to map those keys.

12:37:16
<transcript>: To.

12:37:19
<transcript>: Is it to an object.

12:37:26
<transcript>: I guess I could just get the title.

12:37:26
<transcript>: hang on

12:37:27
<transcript>: Hang on.

12:37:29
structuredchris: hahah this is so over engineered but so reusable

12:37:34
<transcript>: I could look up the title down in the markup. I wouldn't even have to do it in the object.

12:37:37
<transcript>: It's so overengineered.

12:37:37
<transcript>: is it reusable

12:37:39
<transcript>: Is it reusable.

12:37:52
<transcript>: Okay. What am I trying? What do I want the final shape to look like.

12:37:56
<transcript>: What the final shape to look like.

12:38:10
<transcript>: This is how you shouldn't do things. If you're a new developer, you're like, man, this seems way more copkaid than it has to be. It is.

12:38:12
<transcript>: Just don't do it this way.

12:38:12
<transcript>: but we're gonna

12:38:18
<transcript>: But we're gonna finish this because I've gone this far now. So we want the shape of it to look like.

12:38:23
<transcript>: Field goal made attempted.

12:38:23
<transcript>: so

12:38:26
<transcript>: So the keys of this object.

12:38:29
<transcript>: Are.

12:38:38
<transcript>: The titles.

12:38:45
<transcript>: Right. And then we just have the array. It's like.

12:38:49
<transcript>: Is that what we want to look like.

12:38:52
rsromano: What is the circle with the arrow pointing NW that appears in your key presses?

12:38:55
<transcript>: Those are actually strings. It doesn't matter.

12:39:02
<transcript>: What if the circle with the arrow pointing Northwest that appear in your keyboard.

12:39:08
<transcript>: I don't know.

12:39:09
<transcript>: Guess.

12:39:11
<transcript>: I don't know.

12:39:16
<transcript>: I have to just keep typing and see it happen.

12:39:21
structuredchris: i think its commands

12:39:23
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't know. Okay.

12:39:26
<transcript>: That way. I want the shape of its.

12:39:26
structuredchris: like copy etc

12:39:30
<transcript>: Title and then the values for home and away. I think that's the simplest shape.

12:39:38
<transcript>: I think so.

12:39:38
<transcript>: should

12:39:46
<transcript>: Should Rsramano welcome to Chat. Should the title map have that type declaration on the key? That was a long time ago. I'm sorry, I just read that again.

12:39:46
<transcript>: you guys

12:39:49
<transcript>: You guys have apparently gone quiet because.

12:39:49
<transcript>: that's

12:39:50
<transcript>: That's been a while ago.

12:39:59
<transcript>: Okay. So if I wanted to do this, if I wanted this object to just be titled and then home it away.

12:40:10
<transcript>: That is that structure actually work for every case because we do have this offensive. So here these are kind of like special ones that are nested.

12:40:10
<transcript>: i've got

12:40:12
<transcript>: I've got to consider that.

12:40:19
<transcript>: Oh, man, that's that's probably not in the data either. That's just known.

12:40:19
<transcript>: that we should

12:40:21
<transcript>: That we should style those differently.

12:40:36
<transcript>: I was doing so great. We had we had all these done, and then I was like, hey, I can make this better. And here we are, still trying to figure out how to type our object key spread.

12:40:40
<transcript>: I don't like all the redundant markup.

12:40:40
<transcript>: also

12:40:45
<transcript>: Also like bailing on what I've already started some coffee fallacy.

12:40:45
<transcript>: no you're

12:40:48
<transcript>: No, you're good structured, Chris. You're good.

12:40:50
<transcript>: You are fine.

12:40:50
<transcript>: i

12:40:53
<transcript>: I wanted to do something.

12:40:53
<transcript>: more

12:40:59
<transcript>: More clever. I was talked into it very easily, because it sounded nice. It sounded nice that I have all that markup.

12:40:59
<transcript>: but

12:41:09
<transcript>: But I and you know what? This will be reusable. It actually is reusable because every sport. Oh, we have to do it this way. Every sport has a different.

12:41:09
<transcript>: table

12:41:12
<transcript>: Table. So I gotta figure out a way to model this, because.

12:41:12
<transcript>: like each sport

12:41:15
<transcript>: Like each sport if you look at like.

12:41:28
<transcript>: Football game. It's gonna have a very similar note. Oh, here we go. Team stats.

12:41:28
<transcript>: it's gonna have

12:41:32
<transcript>: It's gonna have a very similar like approach. And if we do this.

12:41:32
<transcript>: we can use it

12:41:37
<transcript>: We can use it on any sport I shut for how to model the nesting.

12:41:37
<transcript>: like

12:41:40
<transcript>: Like nesting these under these.

12:41:50
<transcript>: But if I can figure that out, I think it is valuable because now I don't have to rewrite all the markup with the hardcoded titles for every sport. I can just have a.

12:41:52
structuredchris: yeee if you extrapolate the logic you can create a hook / whatever your framework calls it

12:41:53
<transcript>: This title map is gonna be like.

12:41:53
<transcript>: mba

12:41:55
<transcript>: Mba Title map.

12:42:00
<transcript>: Or even better.

12:42:02
<transcript>: We'll just have.

12:42:07
<transcript>: Okay, hear me out. It's a record.

12:42:07
<transcript>: record

12:42:11
<transcript>: Record of gamera domain.

12:42:16
<transcript>: And then here.

12:42:19
<transcript>: Mba.

12:42:21
<transcript>: Oh.

12:42:21
<transcript>: no

12:42:23
<transcript>: No.

12:42:26
<transcript>: Okay. Like this.

12:42:33
<transcript>: It's missing a bunch of stuff, but that's basically what we need to do.

12:42:39
<transcript>: Camera domain.

12:42:39
<transcript>: because we have

12:42:41
<transcript>: Because we have the League right.

12:42:41
<transcript>: where do we have the

12:42:42
juniornascm: If you had an strcuture like item is either a array of a object, if is a object has nothing neste, if is a array its nested.  as @structuredchris  said is  over engineered but reusable

12:42:43
<transcript>: Where do we have the League.

12:42:47
<transcript>: Nba Box for that's not accurate. Oh, this is the oh, Oh.

12:42:55
juniornascm: i may be missing you use case tho

12:43:08
<transcript>: If you had let's see if you had a structure like item. Is either an array of an object. If is an object a. Oh sorry.

12:43:08
<transcript>: is either

12:43:10
juniornascm: i mean array OR object

12:43:12
<transcript>: Is either a array of an object if.

12:43:12
<transcript>: is

12:43:18
<transcript>: Is a object has nothing necessary. If it is a array, it's nested. I gotcha.

12:43:20
<transcript>: Yeah.

12:43:20
<transcript>: no i think you're good

12:43:23
<transcript>: No, I think you're good array or object? Yeah, Yeah.

12:43:28
<transcript>: I want to solve this the right way. I don't want to write that markup for every story.

12:43:31
<transcript>: Independently.

12:43:34
<transcript>: I don't think.

12:43:40
earholesmcgee: Whats good Adam, why ya switching to Astro?

12:43:44
<transcript>: But I did just remember that this is actually a component.

12:43:44
<transcript>: that

12:43:46
<transcript>: That is mba specific.

12:43:54
<transcript>: Like what I just did here with this camera domain thing is not needed because this component.

12:44:02
<transcript>: Should I just do the markup independently? Is this? Am I just wasting time.

12:44:02
<transcript>: because

12:44:08
<transcript>: Because there's just four sports. And I'm gonna have to read you this whole page for every sport anyway.

12:44:14
<transcript>: I think I'm just wasting time. I think this is the part where I cut bait as much as I like the idea of this.

12:44:14
<transcript>: i think

12:44:16
<transcript>: I think I should just.

12:44:20
<transcript>: Kind of forget about it.

12:44:27
<transcript>: Okay, but no, nobody's fault here. I thought it was worth exploring.

12:44:27
<transcript>: what's

12:44:34
<transcript>: What's? Good. Earl Holmes here. I'm sorry, Ear holt. Or what did I read? There? Error, error.

12:44:34
<transcript>: earl

12:44:36
<transcript>: Earl Holmes. I don't know.

12:44:36
<transcript>: ear ho

12:44:41
<transcript>: Ear hole? What's good? Adam, why are you switching nashro.

12:44:41
<transcript>: so

12:44:44
<transcript>: So it's kind of a long answer. But.

12:44:47
<transcript>: Stamus.

12:44:47
<transcript>: gets

12:44:49
<transcript>: Gets a lot of traffic from Google.

12:44:49
<transcript>: and

12:44:58
<transcript>: And eight years ago, we wrote it as like a spa kind of it's Phoenix elixir, plus a react spa kind of embedded in it.

12:44:58
<transcript>: and

12:44:59
<transcript>: And.

12:45:08
tobs_on_twitch: adam.dev is such a nice site, I never thought of look at it before, and I've never see a personal site quite like that

12:45:19
<transcript>: We get like, I don't know, half a million visitors from Google every day. It's not ideal to have your page be a react app when all of your traffic comes from Google. It's just like these are static pages with a bunch of facts on them. They should just be static pages. So it's really should be more server rendered than it is. And why not just move everything into elixir Phoenix? Well, it just easier to find people that know how to use.

12:45:19
<transcript>: typescript

12:45:21
<transcript>: Typescript JavaScript.

12:45:24
ttbishop: think audio is out of sync with video

12:45:27
<transcript>: And we're gonna be adding a whole bunch of new stuff to this app, and we don't want to.

12:45:27
<transcript>: have to

12:45:29
<transcript>: Have to be able or just have to hide.

12:45:33
<transcript>: Licks or people to do frontend work.

12:45:36
earholesmcgee: mmm, why Astro vs Next?

12:45:37
ttbishop: just a little out of sync

12:45:40
<transcript>: Okay, tops on Twitch and dev is such an eyeside. I never thought of a look at it before.

12:45:40
<transcript>: and i've never

12:45:47
<transcript>: And I've never seen a personal site quite like it. Thank you, tops. It's really just for hyperlinks, but Yeah.

12:45:47
<transcript>: i styled

12:45:49
<transcript>: I styled them uniquely.

12:45:54
<transcript>: You think audio is out of sync with video? T. Bishop maybe try.

12:46:03
ttbishop: I did, a few times

12:46:05
<transcript>: Maybe try refreshing your page. I think that's happened to people. It's possible that it's my on my side, but I don't think so. I send my audio straight into my camera.

12:46:05
<transcript>: oh you

12:46:09
<transcript>: Oh, you did a few times. Oh, so you know what? It could be out of sync with this camera.

12:46:09
<transcript>: so tell me if

12:46:13
<transcript>: So tell me if it's out of sync when when you look at this camera.

12:46:15
<transcript>: Is it still out of sync.

12:46:18
<transcript>: How about now.

12:46:20
<transcript>: Thank you for that. Follow.

12:46:26
<transcript>: Leave that follow, mung bean. Oh, and be nine. I missed that follow. I'm so sorry.

12:46:33
ttbishop: yeah, very very little

12:46:34
<transcript>: I think for the follow B nine and whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa? Thank you for the follows gs. Mongo an ear hole, McGee.

12:46:38
<transcript>: Is it better now? Is the audio in sync with my lips.

12:46:41
<transcript>: Very, very, little.

12:46:41
<transcript>: oh it's just

12:46:43
<transcript>: Oh, it's just a little out of sync.

12:46:43
<transcript>: this could be

12:46:48
<transcript>: This could be a mepring problem. This could be that I need to go in and change something.

12:46:48
<transcript>: it

12:46:57
<transcript>: It's me. Thank you for the follow. Also, valko, I don't know why everybody just decided they were gonna follow all at once, but I appreciate each one of you.

12:47:04
<transcript>: Why did I end up on this screen? Oh, yeah? We're gonna see if my audio's in sync? And it's just a little out of sync.

12:47:07
tobs_on_twitch: have you considered prerender or some alternate service?

12:47:12
<transcript>: Van salzig. Thanks for the follow. Any time to eat a lara bar? Oh, I should have a lar bar segment.

12:47:20
kryotoboi: Are we leaving now ?

12:47:24
structuredchris: it gets better after alerts end? maybe

12:47:32
<transcript>: Trickery. Thanks so much for the follow trickery. Have you owe great question, tops. Have you considered prerender or some alternatives service? Yes. We use free render. We have a very convoluted pre render setup. It's a custom prerender that crawls the size at all times so that we serve.

12:47:32
<transcript>: pages to google

12:47:33
<transcript>: Pages to Google.

12:47:33
<transcript>: quickly

12:47:35
<transcript>: Quickly.

12:47:35
<transcript>: we want to get rid of

12:47:45
<transcript>: We want to get rid of all that. And we just want to be able to build a little more quickly with our stack. We're just a little like elixir. Phoenix is a pretty niche thing.

12:47:45
<transcript>: and

12:47:46
<transcript>: And.

12:47:46
<transcript>: with all the new

12:47:49
<transcript>: With all the new functionality we're gonna build it just be nice to know.

12:47:49
<transcript>: a little faster

12:47:51
<transcript>: A little faster.

12:47:57
<transcript>: Are we leaving now? No one's leaving. I'm not going anywhere. It gets better after alerts. End. Maybe.

12:48:03
kryotoboi: What was old site built on ?

12:48:04
<transcript>: Oh, my audio gets more in sync after alerts end that's concerning.

12:48:09
<transcript>: That's actually worse.

12:48:09
<transcript>: the old

12:48:13
<transcript>: The old site was built on elixir elixir in Phoenix.

12:48:14
<transcript>: And.

12:48:21
<transcript>: React it's like Create, React, app.

12:48:21
<transcript>: okay

12:48:23
<transcript>: Okay. I'm actually gonna.

12:48:23
<transcript>: this is

12:48:27
<transcript>: This is awesome. I'm gonna create a little segment screen.

12:48:36
<transcript>: Right now just by 1 second, you're never even gonna know I did it. I'm so fast. So we're gonna have a little.

12:48:39
<transcript>: Da DA DA DA DA.

12:48:43
<transcript>: We're gonna have a little lar bar.

12:48:44
<transcript>: Segment.

12:48:51
<transcript>: Okay. Here goes.

12:48:56
<transcript>: Is that gonna work? Yeah, I think so. I think that'll work.

12:48:58
<transcript>: I just do that.

12:49:07
<transcript>: Okay. I wasn't as fast as I thought I'd be, but I think it's time for lar. So here's a really cheesy segment screen.

12:49:09
vansalzig: good morning. Kinda funny to see/hear you're reasoning. I know a team that is dropping elixir+absinth+spa to switch to elixir+phoenix+live-views

12:49:18
vansalzig: *your

12:49:22
earholesmcgee: ohhhh

12:49:23
<transcript>: How about that.

12:49:23
<transcript>: i got

12:49:31
<transcript>: I got my larva bar. Now, that was really nerdy. I'm kind of a nerd. I gotta get rid of a little Loading bar at the bottom. That doesn't really make sense, does it.

12:49:32
earholesmcgee: I thought you were talking about the PHP framework...

12:49:48
<transcript>: Work on the Chat Van salsa. Good morning. Kind of thing to see. Here your reasoning. I know a team that is dropping elixir plus Absent plus Spa. Just switch your lister Plus Phoenix Plus live views. Yeah. No. If we were more profient with elixir and like.

12:49:48
<transcript>: there are reasons

12:49:56
<transcript>: There are reasons we could have stuck with elixir and just leaned into it and just moved all the react stuff into into like serviceide rendering.

12:49:56
trivenge: what do we do to nerds chat? *drunks adam's head into a toilet*

12:49:59
trivenge: dunks*

12:50:00
<transcript>: But we didn't we went with Astro.

12:50:04
<transcript>: I thought you were talking about the php framework.

12:50:07
<transcript>: What's the php framework.

12:50:11
<transcript>: What do we do to nerds chat.

12:50:14
<transcript>: That's funny.

12:50:16
earholesmcgee: laravar

12:50:18
<transcript>: So I think the segment.

12:50:18
<transcript>: title

12:50:21
<transcript>: Title screen needs to be shorter.

12:50:23
<transcript>: It's too long.

12:50:26
<transcript>: That's what's on my mind right now.

12:50:31
vansalzig: @earholesmcgee laravel?

12:50:36
mjewl: We do all our backend stuff in Elixir (with a tiny bit of Rust), but don't really have much web front.

12:50:36
<transcript>: Oh, larryville, Yeah.

12:50:37
trivenge: do you still play basketball at all?

12:50:42
<transcript>: I see you saw lara Bar. And you thought of laravel.

12:50:45
<transcript>: I got you.

12:50:51
<transcript>: In Jul. We do all our back in seven elixir with a tiny bit of rust. Don't really have much weatherfront.

12:50:54
<transcript>: Tribe do you still play basketball.

12:50:54
<transcript>: so it's been years

12:50:55
<transcript>: So it's been years.

12:50:57
<transcript>: Since I've played basketball.

12:50:57
<transcript>: i used to play

12:51:00
<transcript>: I used to play early morning basketball.

12:51:00
<transcript>: like two or

12:51:02
<transcript>: Like two or three times a week.

12:51:05
<transcript>: It's been years.

12:51:05
<transcript>: i have a bad

12:51:07
<transcript>: I have a bad knee.

12:51:07
<transcript>: like

12:51:08
<transcript>: Like.

12:51:08
<transcript>: i

12:51:11
<transcript>: I tore it up pretty bad in high school sports.

12:51:11
<transcript>: and

12:51:13
trivenge: understandable

12:51:15
<transcript>: And I've had surgery. And it's like.

12:51:15
<transcript>: i just don't

12:51:19
trivenge: oof

12:51:21
<transcript>: I just don't have one of the ligaments in my knee posterior cruciate. It's like the third.

12:51:21
<transcript>: wheel

12:51:25
earholesmcgee: Do you follow the NBA?

12:51:34
<transcript>: Wheel everyone knows about the eight L and the mcl. Well, the pco is like this stabilizing ligament that basically, if your leg has been at a nine degree angle, it keeps your Shin from moving toward your body.

12:51:34
<transcript>: and

12:51:37
<transcript>: And I tour mine really bad in high school.

12:51:37
<transcript>: and

12:51:46
<transcript>: And it's basically non existent now. So my knee is very loose and floppy, like I went to physical therapist a couple weeks ago.

12:51:46
<transcript>: and it's

12:51:48
trivenge: gotcha

12:51:53
<transcript>: And it's the second physical therapist that when they felt the slack in my knee, they brought all the other physical therapists over to show them.

12:51:53
<transcript>: so it's

12:51:55
<transcript>: So it's bad.

12:51:55
<transcript>: and it

12:52:02
vansalzig: the moment when you don't trust your knee anymore.

12:52:03
<transcript>: And it makes things, like, cutting sharp, like, I can move, I can run. I could, like, do stuff. But it makes it harder to, like.

12:52:03
<transcript>: really move

12:52:06
earholesmcgee: the ole'floppy knee

12:52:09
<transcript>: Really move on a basketball court. So I try not to do stuff like that as much as I love playing basketball.

12:52:12
<transcript>: My knee is not great.

12:52:12
<transcript>: do i

12:52:14
<transcript>: Do I follow the NBA.

12:52:14
<transcript>: i

12:52:16
<transcript>: I used to a lot more.

12:52:18
trivenge: does it help to exercise a little despite that?

12:52:20
<transcript>: We started stat muse as huge NBA fans.

12:52:35
<transcript>: And after five years, I just kind of got burned out on sports. I think we did a lot of fun sports. Things went to a lot of games and met a lot of people, athletes, owners, that kind of thing. We had a really good time at sports fans. But I just kind of, like, got more obsessed with technology in that time.

12:52:35
<transcript>: kind of fell

12:52:42
<transcript>: Kind of fell out of like the love of fandom of sports structure. Chris thanks so much for the follow.

12:52:45
<transcript>: following

12:52:46
<transcript>: Following.

12:52:49
<transcript>: Yeah the moment when you don't question me anymore.

12:52:55
<transcript>: I'm in my knees been like this for years. So.

12:52:57
<transcript>: I definitely played on it.

12:52:59
<transcript>: In this state.

12:52:59
<transcript>: in adulthood

12:53:01
<transcript>: In adulthood.

12:53:04
<transcript>: I do just I kind of worry about.

12:53:09
<transcript>: Messing it up worse. I just don't want to spend, like.

12:53:09
<transcript>: i don't know

12:53:10
<transcript>: I don't know.

12:53:10
<transcript>: all the time

12:53:15
<transcript>: All the time you have to spend recovering from a torn acl because I just don't have a lot of stability in it.

12:53:19
<transcript>: The old flappy knee. Exactly.

12:53:21
<transcript>: Does it help to exercise a little despite that. Yeah.

12:53:29
<transcript>: It is actually important that I, like actually do like workouts and try and build strength around the knee.

12:53:33
trivenge: gotcha

12:53:34
<transcript>: But like dynamic movements in a sports setting.

12:53:37
<transcript>: Just not really there.

12:53:41
<transcript>: Okay.

12:53:41
trivenge: so mainly lifting a lil?

12:53:44
<transcript>: So.

12:53:45

12:53:49
<transcript>: We're gonna go back and finish that page.

12:53:49
<transcript>: want to be

12:53:57
<transcript>: Want to be done with the box for page done. Actually, we just want to finish the basketball one. I'm gonna have to do it for the other three sports.

12:54:01
<transcript>: So. Mainly lifting. Yeah, exactly. I do.

12:54:03

12:57:37
thdxr: i wanna see

12:57:38
<transcript>: It's like a little title screen when I do stuff like lara Bar of our Time, that one's really cheesy. But I'm gonna have little segments where I like, read Twitter. Do we want to read Twitter? You might want to like, see how it goes. If I try and read and react to Twitter.

12:57:39

<transcript>: Is it fake? It's fake. Okay, it's fake.

13:03:03
<transcript>: That's just a joke, but it's really funny out of my fall. A low latency option in twitch if you tried, that what I am doing a little latency. What are you talking about? Is it not low latency.

13:03:10
<transcript>: Are you just making fun of me? I think it just makes it funny.

13:04:29
tobs_on_twitch: I have low latency off on my end though :p

13:04:33
<transcript>: Have you guys seen you write a single test on stream.

13:04:35
rollie042: Who needs test. Just write things properly.

13:04:39
<transcript>: You have low latency off on your end.

13:04:42
tobs_on_twitch: ^!

13:04:42
<transcript>: Just write things properly the first time. That's what I'm saying.

13:04:49

13:04:51

13:04:54
schrew: I have seen you write a single enum on stream!

13:04:58

13:05:03
vapor__dev: Tests are for people who write bugs

13:05:03
<transcript>: This is boring just to scroll my it turns out my feet is very boring.

13:05:08

13:05:14
mattmancodes: React

13:05:18
<transcript>: Stream clock in the corner and Twitch stream are 5 seconds apart.

13:05:22
<transcript>: So I've got a five second delay.

13:05:28
<transcript>: I seen you read a single email on stream. That's funny.

13:05:33
<transcript>: A tester for people who write bugs. Hey, Alan, I knew it was you this time.

13:05:33
<transcript>: i saw

13:05:49
<transcript>: It is Alan. Decks. Stop it.

13:06:00
restarted: I'm also Alan.

13:06:01
<transcript>: I don't really have any reactions to this. I don't really use react anymore, but I never found anything hard about using type script with react.

13:06:01
<transcript>: now types

13:06:04
trivenge: its about 4 seconds, but thats normal stuff

13:06:04
<transcript>: Now typescript with astro I have issues.

13:06:04
<transcript>: but i think it's

13:06:05
mattmancodes: No, the hard part is React. It's daft.

13:06:08
<transcript>: But I think it's because I use neo them. I bet if I use vs. Code to be fine.

13:06:15
<transcript>: What's your deal with type. Oh, this is a good one. At this point, I'm a little Barrett embarrassed to ask what.

13:06:15
<transcript>: but y'all

13:06:24
thdxr: I replied to that tweet

13:06:30
<transcript>: But y'all what's the deal with Types? I've been programming with php and js for a thousand years and I don't think I've ever had a problem caused by types. What am I missing out on? So you're saying he doesn't have types? Oh, cuz like php. They don't do types. Is that what I'm gathering.

13:06:30
<transcript>: like larvae

13:06:32
thdxr: read my reply!

13:06:36
<transcript>: Like larvael. You don't have types. And larabelle ooh, you don't have types. Oh, dax, had.

13:06:36

13:06:45
spotmonk: Everyone has a type

13:06:45
thdxr: there was a funny thread

13:06:46
<transcript>: A reply to this tweet you don't even have types in laravel. I didn't think about that. All the larvaledevs they love life. They are living the good life.

13:06:46
<transcript>: driving

13:06:53
codingrob: you have types in laravel.

13:07:04
<transcript>: Driving lambos. They've got it good, but they don't have types. This is a very old debate, and I think it's very hard to understand without hindsight. The closest way I can explain it is to imagine using MySQL the way I'm using it. Then imagine how you're supposed to use it. The gap with type and then types is similar. That's good. I like that.

13:07:09
spotmonk: mine is int32 and big booties

13:07:09
codingrob: or in php in general. At least, all my code is fully typed.

13:07:11
mattmancodes: LUL LUL

13:07:17
<transcript>: I can't believe Lareville does. Don't have types. You have types in Lareville coating. Rob, welcome to Chat. Wait. You do have types or in php. In general, at least all my code is fully Typed. Okay.

13:07:19
<transcript>: So then.

13:07:23
<transcript>: Aaron just chooses not to use them. Maybe.

13:07:26
kryotoboi: Everybody's got a type

13:07:27
vansalzig: @CodingRob but types in PHP are only hints, and not required :)

13:07:28
codingrob: it just is not mandatory to use it

13:07:29
<transcript>: I don't even remember a life without types.

13:07:34
thdxr: check the thread under my reply

13:07:44
vapor__dev: Dax we did 3 years in elixir‚Ä¶what a time it was‚Ä¶

13:07:51
<transcript>: My guess is it you write a lot of tests. I don't care about typing in the ruby app I work on because it's well, Teddyested, when I work on the elm and csharp apps at my work pipes are critical because test coverage is lacking.

13:07:51
<transcript>: yeah i guess

13:07:53
<transcript>: Yeah. I guess I I.

13:07:54
thdxr: I did 5 years

13:07:58
thdxr: catch up

13:08:03
structuredchris: ye idk i love starting off by defining a shit load of types in ts, its like templating the app out Kreygasm

13:08:05
<transcript>: I'd rather get that instant feedback, right? I don't know, dax. You gave a good answer. I don't need to try and add a good answer.

13:08:07

13:08:10

13:08:15
<transcript>: Mine is in 32 and big booties.

13:08:15
<transcript>: or in

13:08:21
<transcript>: Types in VHP are only hints and not required.

13:08:29
<transcript>: Check the thread under your reply. Dax. Okay, there's a thread here.

13:08:34
<transcript>: Thread. Okay. See, Twitter is kind of hard sometimes.

13:08:40
<transcript>: Is this your wave announcing you'd love no sequel? That's funny.

13:08:47
<transcript>: This is funny off. It kind of enlightening. Is that the thread? Just the Alex one. That's good though.

13:08:48
thdxr: no

13:08:51

13:08:54
thdxr: I forgot where it was

13:08:56
thdxr: oh well

13:09:03
thdxr: maybe in Alexs reply

13:09:08
<transcript>: And also your sense. I was surprised by how much I like typescript. Just don't go crazy with it. Some go way too far trying to get me fired with a lot. No sequel talk. I guess I've seen people on Twitter go and crazy with it doesn't seem appealing at all. I will say this. I have no desire to learn like the crazy advanced stuff.

13:09:08
<transcript>: i

13:09:09
<transcript>: I know.

13:09:09
<transcript>: people that

13:09:24
<transcript>: People that do work on libraries need to know that stuff. I don't know. I've got dax on my chat so I can just ask him when I do something that I don't know how to do. And he helps me do it like I won't be taking any of the big Advanced typescript courses.

13:09:24
<transcript>: this is not

13:09:28
<transcript>: This is not appealing to me. Like when I look at those advanced types.

13:09:28
<transcript>: i think

13:09:30
structuredchris: oh like using generics n shit? that what you call advanced or what

13:09:33
<transcript>: I think it's really ugly. Like I just have no desire to learn what they mean.

13:09:33
<transcript>: does that

13:09:36
<transcript>: Does that make me? I don't know.

13:09:42
<transcript>: An applicant developer? Yeah, I'm an application developer. I'm not a library author.

13:09:42
<transcript>: and

13:09:45
structuredchris: like using generic functions to define fixed length arrays etc

13:09:46
<transcript>: And I never will be because I don't want to learn that stuff.

13:09:49
<transcript>: It's hideous. It's hideous to me.

13:09:49
<transcript>: like using

13:09:53
alexkates: I'm 100% the same way Adam. I'm a product dev, i just want intellisense

13:09:59
<transcript>: Like using generics. Yeah, that's what we call advance. Yeah, I think so. Like when you're doing all that crazy generic stuff to create good type inference in your library.

13:10:01
<transcript>: Yeah.

13:10:06
rollie042: TS template definitions are like c++ was 15 years ago.  Not fun to try to understand or write.

13:10:07
<transcript>: Alex. 100% same way product dev. I just went intellisense. Exactly. Me too.

13:10:11
<transcript>: I code for food. Thanks so much for the follow.

13:10:11
<transcript>: why

13:10:12
earholesmcgee: Makes me happy one dev is saying they dont want to learn stuff. Just trying to have a good time

13:10:19
<transcript>: Why is my music not playing? I think this is dumb, but I think I'm gonna have to go to the screen.

13:10:23
<transcript>: And then go back to this one.

13:10:26
<transcript>: To get my music.

13:10:30
<transcript>: There it is.

13:10:36
<transcript>: Because I made changes to my thing, to automate, like fading my music in and out. Some dumb.

13:10:40
<transcript>: Raleigh, ts template definitions are like C.

13:10:40
<transcript>: cigarette

13:10:50
<transcript>: Cigarette. Not fun to try to understand or write. Yeah. I have no desire. Makes me happy one day that is saying they don't want to learn stuff. Just try and have a good time. Exactly. I like learning a lot of stuff. Ear holes.

13:10:53
<transcript>: I love it, actually, but.

13:10:58
<transcript>: Advanced typescript, just not on my list of things that would be exciting to me.

13:10:58
<transcript>: okay let's scroll

13:11:00
<transcript>: Okay, let's scroll some more Twitter and I need to get back to work.

13:11:17
<transcript>: Maybe. Let's get out of this this week. The types. I just never thought about people still doing work without types in 2023. That sucks. I feel bad for them. But you know what, Aaron? Probably feels bad for me that I'm not using Larville because they love Lareville. So.

13:11:20
earholesmcgee: Learning stuff that excites you doesnt seem to be the norm in the dev world

13:11:24
<transcript>: Tomorrow on Screen The Private Twofounders, One, bank CEO.

13:11:24
<transcript>: one vc should

13:11:28
<transcript>: One vc should be Jam pack stream. That sounds very exciting.

13:11:33
<transcript>: I wonder if that was before the news broke, that things were gonna be made whole.

13:11:43
<transcript>: Serverside rendering is the future.

13:11:50
<transcript>: Look what they need to mimic a fraction of our power. That's pretty good. That's a pretty good one.

13:11:50
<transcript>: php

13:11:53
<transcript>: Php looking at next yes, it's pretty good.

13:11:57
<transcript>: Astro is very php e right.

13:11:58
fitzsimons_dev: advanced TS is super good for seeming really smart at work though. I'm decidedly average but people think I'm pretty good because I have some medium TS skills

13:12:05
<transcript>: Okay.

13:12:14
thdxr: same

13:12:20
<transcript>: I would argue that if more people call that bullshit like this instead of letting it go, Twitter would be a better place. I've seen that warning before when you want to respond to something very harshly. And they're like, Are you sure about this.

13:12:20
<transcript>: i would argue

13:12:24
<transcript>: I would argue most tweeters do like replies like that.

13:12:32
<transcript>: Maybe the one being replied to does not, but I think the people who consuming the content on Twitter.

13:12:34
<transcript>: They enjoy it.

13:12:40
<transcript>: Learning something excites you doesn't seem to be the norm in the Dev world.

13:12:42
<transcript>: Yeah.

13:12:42
<transcript>: advance

13:12:50
<transcript>: Advanced. He has a super good for seeming really smart at work, though I'm decidedly average, but people think I'm pretty good because I have some medium ts skills that makes sense.

13:12:50
<transcript>: dax

13:12:57
<transcript>: Dax, you're smart. You're just smart. It's not that you have good ts skills. That just is one of the things you're good at.

13:13:03
<transcript>: Okay. Are we done with Twitter? Are we done.

13:13:07
<transcript>: It's not timeline. Bad. I think my timeline's kind of bad.

13:13:11
<transcript>: You guys could tell me how bad my timeline is relative to your timeline.

13:13:12
structuredchris: ive been learning solidity recently and the experience with TS and becoming strict with types is kinda helpful for that transition

13:13:14
thdxr: now to YouTube

13:13:15
<transcript>: I think it's pretty bad.

13:13:19
<transcript>: Now? Youtube. What are we gonna do on YouTube.

13:13:25
vapor__dev: Let‚Äôs read your emails

13:13:28
<transcript>: Next I gotta get something done. I've been learning solidity recently in the experience with ts and become strict with types. It's kind of helpful for that transition.

13:13:28
<transcript>: let's

13:13:30
<transcript>: Let's read your emails.

13:13:35
fitzsimons_dev: do you follow larabar?

13:13:36
<transcript>: You guys are funny. Okay, we're gonna get back to this. So we were so close to being Oops.

13:13:36
<transcript>: done with

13:13:44
<transcript>: Done with this page before I went on a nerd quest that was not worth it turned out.

13:13:48
<transcript>: Dax is gonna see how I'm doing it. And he's gonna be like, no, no, no.

13:13:52
<transcript>: But you know what.

13:13:57
<transcript>: Next I'll do what I want now you don't even know I'm talking about free throw percent.

13:13:57
<transcript>: this is home

13:14:00
<transcript>: This is Home team stats. And this is.

13:14:02
<transcript>: Free throw percent.

13:14:06
<transcript>: Okay.

13:14:10
<transcript>: Now we need to go back over here and copy the next one.

13:14:15
<transcript>: I guess I could make a component out of this.

13:14:15
<transcript>: would that be better

13:14:22
<transcript>: Would that be better? So I don't have to do the styles repeated over and over and over and over and over? Yeah, let's make a component.

13:14:22
<transcript>: it'll just be like

13:14:24
<transcript>: It'll just be like title.

13:14:24
<transcript>: it's just this thing

13:14:25
<transcript>: It's just this thing.

13:14:25
<transcript>: it's

13:14:27
<transcript>: It's a title.

13:14:31
<transcript>: Then the two values right.

13:14:34
<transcript>: Okay, call it.

13:14:39
impostorengineer: Do you have free-throw % over time?

13:14:40
<transcript>: I'm just gonna put it in the same file. Can you an astro? Actually, I don't think I can.

13:14:44
<transcript>: That's just kind of weird about that. You can't really like colocate components.

13:14:44
mattmancodes: no

13:14:51
<transcript>: Do you follow lara Bar? I think so. If it's them and I don't think they tweet.

13:14:51
thdxr: what's your approach for conditional classes in tailwind

13:14:53
structuredchris: yeah, let it have optional children so you can put the component into the component for your nested shit?

13:14:55
<transcript>: Do you have free throw percentage over time.

13:15:01
<transcript>: Oh, what's my approach for conditional classes? Entailing. I will show you DAX.

13:15:04
<transcript>: Astro has a fantastic.

13:15:07
<transcript>: First party approach for this that I love.

13:15:07
<transcript>: in like in

13:15:12
<transcript>: In like in like a next js app. Like reacting javascript framework. I would just use.

13:15:12
<transcript>: class names

13:15:15
<transcript>: Class names. It's like an npm. Lib.

13:15:15
<transcript>: but

13:15:16
alexkates: I've been using import cn from "classnames"

13:15:16
<transcript>: But.

13:15:16
<transcript>: astrobic says

13:15:20
<transcript>: Astrobic says that built in with class list I'll show you.

13:15:28
fitzsimons_dev: +1 to classnames

13:15:33
thdxr: oh I think solid has that too

13:15:34
<transcript>: Yeah, Alex, that's what I normally do. But astro, you can do this. You can say class list, and then you can do all the same things. So you can do, like, flex. True. Just like that.

13:15:34
<transcript>: i said

13:15:36
<transcript>: I said that.

13:15:38
alexkates: !!!

13:15:39
<transcript>: I might be missing a bracket.

13:15:41
<transcript>: You do just like that.

13:15:44
trivenge: @vapor__dev and his taxes and his text messages? LUL

13:15:48
<transcript>: Or you can do it like an array of classes. Just all the things you can do with class names. It just works. But it's classless.

13:15:48
<transcript>: that's nice

13:15:51
<transcript>: That's nice solid. Has that too. That's nice.

13:15:55
<transcript>: Okay.

13:15:55
<transcript>: what's that

13:16:01
<transcript>: What's that doing? Oh, yeah. I was gonna make a component. Unfortunately, I have to make a different file. So we're gonna call this one.

13:16:01
<transcript>: team

13:16:02
<transcript>: Team.

13:16:04
<transcript>: Stat.

13:16:07
<transcript>: Singular assignment.

13:16:14
<transcript>: Game. Team? I don't know. Team Fat. Is that a good name.

13:16:14
<transcript>: it's not

13:16:15
<transcript>: It's not the best name.

13:16:15
<transcript>: but

13:16:19
<transcript>: But it'll work, okay? We're gonna yank that tag.

13:16:19
<transcript>: we're just gonna paste

13:16:21
trivenge: @thdxr  are you a neovim fan as well?

13:16:24
<transcript>: We're just gonna paste it in here. What do we need? What data do we need.

13:16:24
<transcript>: what's wrong

13:16:25
<transcript>: What's wrong with this.

13:16:25
<transcript>: oh

13:16:30
<transcript>: Oh, I did ts. It's astro. Oh, no, oh, no.

13:16:34
<transcript>: Astro.

13:16:36
<transcript>: Okay.

13:16:36
<transcript>: what's wrong with this

13:16:40
<transcript>: What's wrong with this? Why can't I do what I want to do? Restart.

13:16:49
thdxr: yes been using vim almost 10 years now

13:16:51
<transcript>: Why is this so bad? So it's gonna just have a few properties. It's gonna have this one is.

13:16:51
<transcript>: as

13:16:54
<transcript>: Astro, props.

13:16:55
trivenge: hm

13:16:56
rollie042: The slowly panning camera is really snazzy

13:17:06
<transcript>: And we're gonna say, interface.

13:17:06
<transcript>: props

13:17:07
<transcript>: Props.

13:17:14
<transcript>: Has a title string.

13:17:16

<transcript>: This will be home.

13:17:29
<transcript>: okay

13:17:30
<transcript>: Okay.

13:17:30
<transcript>: strong with this

13:17:32
<transcript>: Strong with this.

13:17:32
trivenge: i like how simplistic it is compared to vs code.

13:17:35
<transcript>: Why is this? Why is the market so bad.

13:17:37
<transcript>: What happens.

13:17:40
<transcript>: We were doing so well. What happened.

13:17:43
<transcript>: All of this is so weird.

13:17:49
<transcript>: The song is kind of weird.

13:17:49
<transcript>: but what

13:17:51
<transcript>: But what happened here.

13:17:51
<transcript>: it's got these

13:17:56
<transcript>: It's got these spaces in it. Here we go. That's it. Class. Select.

13:18:08
<transcript>: Some typescript file anymore.

13:18:14
<transcript>: Slowly painting camera is really snazzy thanks Raleigh.

13:18:26
rollie042: @triveNge very much like how vim-using developers are far simpler than vs code devs.

13:18:30
<transcript>: Dax has been using this for ten years. Dax has been doing all the cool things for like, longer than I've been a developer, okay? Not longer than a bit of a developer, but he's been using arch and kneel them and all of these fancy Linuxy things.

13:18:34
<transcript>: Since I was a wee.

13:18:34
<transcript>: lad

13:18:35
<transcript>: Lad.

13:18:35
<transcript>: why i can't figure

13:18:37
dnbull: Howdy!

13:18:39
<transcript>: Why I can't figure out why I do I have all these typescripters.

13:18:40
thdxr: I'm pissed everyone else is using it now

13:18:42
<transcript>: It's just a Nashville component. What's wrong.

13:19:04
thdxr: I need to find new stuff

13:19:04
vapor__dev: No way Dax you were using vscode atRH

13:19:05
<transcript>: Okay. Back in here.

13:19:05
<transcript>: it's gonna

13:19:05
<transcript>: it's gonna be

13:19:05

13:19:23
<transcript>: Okay title.

<transcript>: Home.

13:19:31
<transcript>: I'm sorry that's away field goldmaid attempt.

13:19:36
trivenge: i hate the side panels in vs code tbh, thats what i disliked the most. spent hours seeing if i could remove them all. i like vs code at least, though i am learning through the odin project currently. I plan on checking out neovim in the future for sure

13:19:41
nft_scam: have u tried emacs tho

13:19:53
<transcript>: Okay. Does that work.

13:19:56
<transcript>: I can delete this tag.

13:19:58
<transcript>: It works.

13:19:59
trivenge: does neovim have most, if not, all of the same extensions as vs code?

13:20:05
<transcript>: Bill. Goal made. Attempted. It worked. Maybe. Oh, that's the real page. Let's do this.

13:20:05
thdxr: got burnt out for a while because old vim was more annoying to manage, then neovim made it better

13:20:10
<transcript>: Okay. Did it work.

13:20:16
<transcript>: This is the value look. Correct. Yeah. It works. Okay. Cool. So then.

13:20:23
<transcript>: I guess this one, it's almost like, what do I want to call this? What is this component? It's like.

13:20:23
<transcript>: something else

13:20:30
<transcript>: Something else Seb things I'm sure to follow. Also I coach for food. I missed that. I'm sorry. Thank you for your follow.

13:20:30
<transcript>: appreci

13:20:32
<transcript>: Appreciate it.

13:20:37
<transcript>: Let's see. I had faces where I stopped using them.

13:20:47
<transcript>: Why don't I have like a ton of messages? What happened to my chat.

13:20:52
<transcript>: Dm. Bolts here. You're pissed. Everyone else is doing it. Now, that's what's funny.

13:20:57
<transcript>: What is the deal here.

13:21:01
<transcript>: Structured. Chris. You didn't try to send a message like ten times, did you.

13:21:01

<transcript>: I think my Twitch is bugging out.

13:21:16
rollie042: I think you d/c'd for like 10s

13:21:20
<transcript>: Time to try. Nick's. I can't do the next thing. I don't think I can do that.

13:21:22
nft_scam: u were lagging for a bir

13:21:40
<transcript>: I hate the side panels and Vs code. That's why what I just like the most spent hours seeing if I could remove them all like this code, at least though I am learning through the odin project currently I plan on checking out Neil them in the future for sure. Have you tried emacs? Though I have not tried emax. Does no of them have most, if not all the same extensions as Vs code.

13:21:43
<transcript>: Triv, I think.

13:21:43
<transcript>: i don't feel like

13:21:48
<transcript>: I don't feel like I'm missing anything from vs. Code. I didn't use a ton of extensions.

13:21:52
<transcript>: The only thing I'm missing is good Astro support. I think the astrolog.

13:21:52
<transcript>: astrology

13:21:53
<transcript>: Astrology.

13:21:59
<transcript>: Is not as good as the vs code whatever whatever they do in vs code.

13:22:41
<transcript>: and whenever

13:23:00
<transcript>: And whenever I said out loud that I missed multicursor, everybody like macros, macros are so much better. Macros and vim. I've never gotten the macro thing. Maybe I just haven't. I think I used it a couple times, but like it felt like so much typing to do anything. And I've just never it's not clicked for me. Maybe it will eventually.

13:27:15
<transcript>: I like Capital y.

13:27:15
<transcript>: that seems

13:27:17
<transcript>: That seems like the easiest so far.

13:27:22
cowfacedude99: looks like you haven't been using vim enough LUL. time for vimtutor @thdxr

13:27:22
<transcript>: Reading register zero. Oh, I see, I see.

13:27:22
<transcript>: yg

13:27:24
nft_scam: another reason to love vim

13:27:24
<transcript>: Yg underscore is bad.

13:27:24
<transcript>: looks like

13:27:29
<transcript>: Looks like you haven't been using them enough. Time for vim tutor.

13:27:38
<transcript>: Oh, is, are you saying dax is my vim tutor.

13:27:44
<transcript>: Okay. Free throw made. Attempted. So capital y.

13:27:45
nft_scam: so many ways to do thing

13:27:47
<transcript>: And then I can just do.

13:27:51
<transcript>: I have to actually be on the first letter.

13:27:53
<transcript>: That's fair.

13:27:53
<transcript>: fair

13:27:56
<transcript>: Fair, tough but fair.

13:27:59
<transcript>: We throw made.

13:28:02
spotmonk: can I buy a masterclass in vim?

13:28:03
<transcript>: A free throw made attempt.

13:28:07
<transcript>: Oh, we're getting there people, we're getting there.

13:28:12
<transcript>: Who would didn't like delete in that tag? What happened there.

13:28:17
<transcript>: I didn't delete that tag. Okay.

13:28:23
<transcript>: What.

13:28:23
<transcript>: see that

13:28:24
<transcript>: See that.

13:28:30
rollie042: You can fix your editor problems by running `sudo rm -rf /user/bin/vim && code .`

13:28:32
<transcript>: Okay, one more. And then I've got to figure out the nesting thing.

13:28:44
<transcript>: Throw percent.

13:28:45
cowfacedude99: you can buy a book... @Spotmonk

13:28:46
<transcript>: Okay.

13:28:46
<transcript>: let's just

13:28:49
<transcript>: Let's just delete that tag. Now.

13:28:49
<transcript>: we're back

13:28:54
<transcript>: We're back to where we were, like, an hour ago, and I just got to add.

13:28:58
<transcript>: These rebounds.

13:29:03
<transcript>: And then it hasn't nested.

13:29:09
<transcript>: A nested stat. I don't think it's modeled any differently in the debt and the data.

13:29:11
<transcript>: Rebounds.

13:29:11
<transcript>: how am

13:29:17
<transcript>: How am I gonna decide? Oh, I'm just gonna I'm just gonna make a I'm just gonna do it explicitly, okay? Never mind.

13:29:17
<transcript>: so

13:29:22
<transcript>: So let's copy rebound. I don't need to copy rebounds. It's just normal.

13:29:22
<transcript>: or does

13:29:28
<transcript>: Or does it have? Yeah, it's normal. It's got the bottom one. Yeah, it's the new I got a copy.

13:29:30
<transcript>: Offensive and defensive.

13:29:30
<transcript>: so

13:29:35
<transcript>: So let's do let's do this. We're just copy that in there.

13:29:35
<transcript>: let's say

13:29:36
<transcript>: Let's say.

13:29:36
<transcript>: this

13:29:38
<transcript>: This. It's gonna be ReBash.

13:29:39
trivenge: do people actually read books these days? PogBones

13:29:44
<transcript>: Rebound.

13:29:46
<transcript>: Total reaction.

13:29:49
<transcript>: Oh.

13:29:51
<transcript>: Rebound.

13:29:58
<transcript>: Okay. So that's rebounds. And now we should have.

13:29:58
<transcript>: some

13:30:00
<transcript>: Some fake.

13:30:00
<transcript>: fake

13:30:09
<transcript>: Fake offensive rebounds there. But now we need to make that real. How do I change the component to be like a. This is a nested one. Maybe I'll just make it a separate component.

13:30:09
<transcript>: that feels bad

13:30:13
<transcript>: That feels bad. Now it feels bad. Let's just change the styles accordingly.

13:30:19
<transcript>: Fix your editor problems already pseudo Remove rim Wrap User Bin video.

13:30:21
nft_scam: how u like astro js so far

13:30:22
<transcript>: Use silly guy.

13:30:22
<transcript>: you're being

13:30:24
<transcript>: You're being silly.

13:30:31
<transcript>: Hey like astro. I love it nft I wish the lsp.

13:30:33
<transcript>: I wish it was better.

13:30:33
<transcript>: in

13:30:40
<transcript>: In neovem it's not been a great experience in the event I can't like go to definition in an astrophile.

13:30:40
<transcript>: obviously

13:30:43
<transcript>: Obviously in my typescript files I can do whatever I want, but.

13:30:46
thdxr: astro lsp works better on my neovim than yours

13:30:47
<transcript>: Not been the best in terms of.

13:30:52
<transcript>: Neovim I'm gonna have Fred on my stream.

13:30:52
<transcript>: and

13:30:53
thdxr: it's just slow for me but everything works

13:30:58
<transcript>: And see if he's that's not very fair to Fred to bring him on.

13:30:59
spotmonk: @cowfacedude99 audiobook? I don't want to read...

13:31:00
<transcript>: Ceo.

13:31:00
<transcript>: hey fred

13:31:07
<transcript>: Hey, Fred, why does this obscure thing in my editor work? But I'm gonna bring him on because it'll be fun.

13:31:15
<transcript>: It's just slow for me, but everything works, so works better on menu of him than yours. Oh, next, I'm gonna look at your dot files. Is your stuff on your dot files.

13:31:18
<transcript>: Because I was.

13:31:18
<transcript>: totally steal

13:31:19
thdxr: yeah

13:31:21
nft_scam: that would be interesting

13:31:23
<transcript>: Totally steal whatever you're doing things so much with follow devd.

13:31:25
<transcript>: Yeah, I wonder what I'm doing wrong.

13:31:25
<transcript>: now i really

13:31:28
<transcript>: Now I really want to look at your dot files. Let's just look at your documents.

13:31:31
<transcript>: Github.com.

13:31:31
<transcript>: th

13:31:35
<transcript>: Thbxr.

13:31:43
<transcript>: File. Files? Where are your files? Can I just guess? Is it just files? Probably. No.

13:31:43
<transcript>: what

13:31:43
thdxr: it's called environment

13:31:46
<transcript>: What did you call your dot file? Tacs.

13:31:50
<transcript>: Environment so fancy.

13:31:50
<transcript>: is that

13:31:53
<transcript>: Is that like a linux thing? What? I just not understand.

13:31:55
nft_scam: oooooo

13:31:56
<transcript>: Config in them.

13:32:01
trivenge: LUL

13:32:06
thdxr: it's in after I think

13:32:09
<transcript>: Let's look at your. I want to see your lsp? Config. I just look right past it in plugin. Nope.

13:32:12
<transcript>: After plugin. Here we go.

13:32:12
<transcript>: tree set

13:32:14
<transcript>: Tree setter.

13:32:18
<transcript>: Fusitive? Lsp let's see what you got going on here.

13:32:24
<transcript>: Insurance stalled Astro maybe I'll Maybe I'll actually.

13:32:24
<transcript>: oh

13:32:26
<transcript>: Oh, you're using lsp zero.

13:32:29
thdxr: I made this repo before I knew people called it dotfiles

13:32:31
<transcript>: Who did I hear about this from? I feel like I should be using that.

13:32:34
trivenge: !youtube

13:32:42
<transcript>: You made it before. You knew. People called it DA Files. Wow. You probably did. You've had, like, a ten year old file. That was before that was even a thing.

13:32:42
trivenge: !yt

13:32:46
<transcript>: Jcod think you so much for that follow.

13:32:46
<transcript>: oh

13:32:49
<transcript>: Oh tribe, I need a YouTube command.

13:32:52
<transcript>: I do need that.

13:32:52
<transcript>: so

13:32:56
thdxr: I switched to lsp zero but my previous setup worked also

13:33:00
<transcript>: So this is why yours is gonna work in my doesn't because yours is like super simple in mine is super bad. Let's go to mine. Github.com Adam.

13:33:04
<transcript>: Or file, files.

13:33:04
<transcript>: mine is

13:33:05
<transcript>: Mine is bad.

13:33:08
<transcript>: Mine is not as good.

13:33:12
<transcript>: Because I have so much in mind probably.

13:33:12
<transcript>: let's

13:33:14
<transcript>: Let's see.

13:33:20
<transcript>: Where did I put? Where did I put it.

13:33:23
<transcript>: Lua more.

13:33:27
<transcript>: Plugins. Where's my lsp stuff.

13:33:33
<transcript>: Ft detect.

13:33:36
<transcript>: That. I know what that is. That's an Astro thing.

13:33:36
<transcript>: did i look

13:33:38
<transcript>: Did I look in everything.

13:33:44
<transcript>: I'm looking right past it. Aren't I.

13:33:49
<transcript>: Lsp there's Mason.

13:33:55
<transcript>: Tree setter? Where do I configure? My lsp.

13:33:55
<transcript>: one

13:33:56
<transcript>: One.

13:34:00
<transcript>: Let's go on.

13:34:00
<transcript>: i was it in plug

13:34:08
<transcript>: I was it in plugin. Oh, it might be in plugin. There we go. Lspg and all. Ls. I don't know why it's in there. So look at all this nasty stuff that I have.

13:34:08
<transcript>: do you

13:34:10
<transcript>: Do you actually do auto.

13:34:13
<transcript>: Do you do auto.

13:34:13
<transcript>: like

13:34:15
<transcript>: Like format with prettier.

13:34:19
<transcript>: What is all this? Like, why do I have all this.

13:34:19
thdxr: yeah I do

13:34:22
thdxr: prettierd

13:34:27
<transcript>: Yeah, you do. I just got to copy your setup. I might just use a kickstart.

13:34:29
<transcript>: Invent or something.

13:34:29
<transcript>: just

13:34:37
aj_stuyvenberg: kickstart!!!

13:34:39
<transcript>: Just start over with mine. It's too much. What is all this stuff? I don't even know what all this is. I mean, I know I'm configuring a bunch of but that's just too much work. I shouldn't have to do all that.

13:34:41
aj_stuyvenberg: so good.

13:34:42
<transcript>: That's just dumb.

13:34:43
thdxr: I redid mine after primes video

13:34:48
<transcript>: Kicksart so good, says aj. Yeah, I need to just do something simple.

13:34:48
<transcript>: you did

13:34:53
<transcript>: You did your seat. That's what I thought about dax. When I saw Prime Video and then kickstart.

13:35:06
<transcript>: Teaches video came out right after that. I was like, I just need to use this. Their stuff is so much better than mine. What is all this? Nols, I'm doing all this weird. Yeah, we'll do that on stream at some point. Maybe this week.

13:35:11
<transcript>: Because my Astro setup it does not work and it should because.

13:35:13
<transcript>: It works on the access. Okay.

13:35:18
thdxr: you basically did "twitch builds my neovim config"

13:35:18
<transcript>: Often three best. So this one is gonna be we're just changing the styles a bit.

13:35:22
<transcript>: Based on Why is that thoughts in my bold.

13:35:27
<transcript>: Oh, no? Because my lsp is broken.

13:35:32
<transcript>: Basically did twitch build my Neovim config. Yeah, that's what I did.

13:35:40
<transcript>: Let's yank in here and let's go.

13:35:46
<transcript>: Back to our team, stat. I don't love this name. Teenstap.

13:35:46
<transcript>: and maybe

13:35:48
<transcript>: And maybe I should try in six months.

13:35:51
<transcript>: Because this is really annoying. Like.

13:35:52
devd0: I love nvim but I feel like I spend too much time adding plugins that I might as well just use vscode with the vim plugin lmao

13:35:55
<transcript>: That's just that's out of date. What is going on.

13:35:59
<transcript>: Like is it on the right file.

13:36:03
<transcript>: Lsp restart.

13:36:11
<transcript>: Yeah, debbie. I think.

13:36:11
<transcript>: if you don't

13:36:21
<transcript>: If you don't enjoy the process of tinkering with the navigation config, you should just use vs. Code with them bindings vs. Code or Neilbim is like I actually want.

13:36:21
<transcript>: thinker

13:36:21
luisdaprogrammer: Hello, use vscode

13:36:25
<transcript>: Thinker. And I do enjoy it. I enjoy the tinkering.

13:36:30
<transcript>: The programmer. Welcome to Chat. Hello. Use this code.

13:36:32
<transcript>: That's totally fair.

13:36:33
thdxr: vscode is so slow for me

13:36:36
<transcript>: Okay. So this is what I need to do. I need to say.

13:36:37
thdxr: has always felt super laggy

13:36:39
<transcript>: Thanks for Follow Tony.

13:36:42
nft_scam: ^ same laggy af

13:36:43
<transcript>: I need to say.

13:36:45
devd0: @thdxr VScode is slow for everyone

13:36:50
<transcript>: I've never felt the vs. Code slowness. I've never felt it because.

13:36:50
<transcript>: i have really

13:36:55
<transcript>: I have really powerful machines not using some Linux machine X.

13:36:55
aj_stuyvenberg: yeah a sufficiently large go/ts project kills my vscode every time

13:36:59
devd0: WE REALY NEED A NATIVE VSCODE WITHOUT ELECTRON

13:37:01
<transcript>: Pc or whatever you use. Thanks for Follow Louis the programmer.

13:37:07
<transcript>: Sufficiently large go GS project kills my vs code every time.

13:37:07
<transcript>: we

13:37:09
mattmancodes: Zed is quite nice but obviously doesn't have plugins, etc yet

13:37:12
<transcript>: We really need a native vs code without electron. Oh, it's written an electron. That's right.

13:37:18
thdxr: benchmark me 1v1 right now

13:37:21
<transcript>: I really can't. I can't focus with this. The lsp so bad.

13:37:21
<transcript>: like what

13:37:23
<transcript>: Like, what is it doing right now.

13:37:29
aj_stuyvenberg: m1 max and 64gb, still problematic for me ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

13:37:30
juniornascm: we dont need vscode, we only need neovim!

13:37:32
<transcript>: I have to just quit and come back. I think Neil is just something was bad. There real bad.

13:37:32
<transcript>: component

13:37:37
<transcript>: Components. We're going back into this team stack component. It's gonna be better now, and yeah, okay.

13:37:41
<transcript>: Let's see.

13:37:41
<transcript>: dax

13:37:43
<transcript>: Daxis, Mason.

13:37:48
<transcript>: But can I still use Mason with that setup with.

13:37:48
<transcript>: results

13:37:51
<transcript>: Results to zero better.

13:37:56
<transcript>: Is it bundle? What Mason does for me. Like install the actual.

13:37:56
<transcript>: serv

13:37:58
<transcript>: Servers.

13:38:00
thdxr: idk what mason is

13:38:07
juniornascm: lsp zero uses mason

13:38:10
thdxr: yeah it does have an ls installer

13:38:16
<transcript>: So what I want to do? You don't know what Mason is. It actually like, installs. Like if you want to install typescript server or whatever it's called typetrip language server on your machine. Mason just does it. Lsd zero uses Mason. Okay, we're doing it right now. We're doing it right now.

13:38:16
<transcript>: we're gonna

13:38:18
<transcript>: We're gonna say.

13:38:20
thdxr: didn't know that was mason

13:38:21
trivenge: 5950x and 64gb of ram here, hopefully vs code never lags for me NotLikeThis

13:38:24
cowfacedude99: mason is a installer.

13:38:24
<transcript>: Files? We're gonna say cd files.

13:38:30
<transcript>: In them. Actually, let's go push the config and then.

13:38:35
<transcript>: We're fixing it. We're fixing my stupid dot files because they drive me nuts.

13:38:41
<transcript>: Okay. Here's how we're fixing it. We're just copy and pasting from daxis files. That's what we're doing.

13:38:44
<transcript>: So lsp zero.

13:38:44
<transcript>: ls

13:38:47
<transcript>: Lsp. Preset. Recommended.

13:38:47
<transcript>: ts

13:38:52
<transcript>: Tsrver, go and astro that would work for me. I don't do anything else right now.

13:38:54
<transcript>: Set preferences.

13:38:57
<transcript>: I don't know what all this is.

13:39:00
<transcript>: Oh, no, your mappings are gonna be different than mine, though.

13:39:05
<transcript>: Can I get used to them.

13:39:10
<transcript>: Cp previous next is CN.

13:39:13
<transcript>: Y is confirm.

13:39:15
<transcript>: See, Space is complete.

13:39:19
<transcript>: Tab. I could probably make this work.

13:39:23
<transcript>: I could probably make this work.

13:39:25
<transcript>: Mapping.

13:39:25
<transcript>: louis snip

13:39:26
devd0: omg @thdxr wtf are these bindings lmao

13:39:27
<transcript>: Louis? Snip. What is this.

13:39:41
<transcript>: Unattached. Oh, this. I don't know if I could get used to this. Hang on. What was this? Cmp mappings? Oh, okay, let's just when CMP that hovers thing that comes up.

13:39:48
thdxr: they're what produce the incredible code you all enjoy

13:39:51
<transcript>: Ts Server root.

13:39:54
<transcript>: What? Is all that okay. I guess so.

13:39:57
<transcript>: Let's just try it.

13:39:57
<transcript>: so

13:40:01
<transcript>: So we're gonna just replace all of my lsp? Config.

13:40:01
<transcript>: with

13:40:03
<transcript>: With DAXes.

13:40:06
<transcript>: Just coming. A new file.

13:40:06
<transcript>: i'm gonna do

13:40:09
<transcript>: I'm gonna do in plugin, though. Why did I do that.

13:40:10
<transcript>: After.

13:40:13
<transcript>: Yeah after.

13:40:13
<transcript>: so

13:40:14
<transcript>: So.

13:40:17
<transcript>: And after I'm just gonna have a.

13:40:19
<transcript>: Did you do it in play.

13:40:24
<transcript>: Lsp? Lua.

13:40:27
cowfacedude99: I never got the advantages of mason. I always installed directly on ubuntu and now nix bundles my lsp's with me.

13:40:27
<transcript>: And we're just gonna paste it all in there.

13:40:36
<transcript>: This is where I'm gonna have issue, probably. And where I want to maybe change something. Let's see.

13:40:36
<transcript>: lsp

13:40:42
jenswoeste: good afternoon adam. re-writing the internet?

13:40:43
<transcript>: Lsp definitions. Gd. Oh, telescope. Oh, that's better. Okay, you just did things better than me.

13:40:47
<transcript>: References? Oh, I do gr, I do rename? But that's fine.

13:40:48
cowfacedude99: you need to comment out all the stuff in cmp @adamdotdev

13:40:53
<transcript>: For rename that makes way more sense.

13:40:59
<transcript>: K is for having. Yeah, this is just good. It's just good. Ws works a symbol. Open float.

13:41:04
<transcript>: Got to next so that I don't I'm gonna change that probably. But.

13:41:10
<transcript>: Go to next, go to previous or maybe I should just get used to what you're doing.

13:41:17
<transcript>: I smash control J a lot need to comment all the stuff in CMP okay.

13:41:19
<transcript>: Comment it out.

13:41:23
<transcript>: Somebody got it configured is what you're saying.

13:41:23
<transcript>: but

13:41:26
thdxr: I don't use go to next so don't mind that one

13:41:29
<transcript>: But look but like lsp does stuff with it. Should I not have that.

13:41:29
thdxr: I should remap it

13:41:35
cowfacedude99: in the cmp file

13:41:40
<transcript>: Rewriting the Internet yens. That's right. Good afternoon, yons, it's nice to see you.

13:41:46
cowfacedude99: after/plugin/cmp

13:41:49
<transcript>: They're what produce the incredible code you all enjoy.

13:41:49
<transcript>: i never got the advantage

13:41:55
<transcript>: I never got the advantage of Mason. I was installed directly on Bunch, and now nick's bundles my lcd's with me. Oh, Nick.

13:41:55
<transcript>: in the

13:42:01
<transcript>: In the cmp file. So, yeah, maybe I should just get rid of my cmp file. What's in here that I care about.

13:42:06
<transcript>: Do I care about any of this? What is Lewis? Sniploaders. From vs. Code? What is that.

13:42:08
masicadebou: Hello Adam. I want to start programming in python. Is it possible to dev some games for Android/iOS in python/unity

13:42:10
<transcript>: Check back space.

13:42:13
<transcript>: Kind icon. So I want any of this.

13:42:15
<transcript>: Massy.

13:42:33
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Hello, Adam. I want to start programming in python. Is it possible to Dev some games for Android, iOS and python? Unity? I have no idea. Actually, Unity is a game engine. I just don't know if there's python involved. I don't recall. I've actually built some stuff in Unity randomly.

13:42:43
<transcript>: I think so. To follow debtless net an ex. Earnest. I didn't see that.

13:42:45
aj_stuyvenberg: games are too hard for me, please don't make me do vectors again

13:42:48
<transcript>: So I don't know if there's Python involved. I don't know if you can do that.

13:42:48
<transcript>: oh

13:42:51
rollie042: Python is not really big in the gamedev space

13:42:51
<transcript>: Oh, do I want any of this? What is all this.

13:42:52
trivenge: i thought game devs use c#

13:42:53
<transcript>: Formatting.

13:42:59
<transcript>: Is all this? I feel like I don't need all this. Oh, copilot.

13:43:03
<transcript>: You use copilot X.

13:43:06
<transcript>: Do you use copilot.

13:43:07
rollie042: Learn c# and learn unity :P

13:43:12
jenswoeste: ^

13:43:12
thdxr: yes I use copilot

13:43:16
thdxr: I'm not a caveman

13:43:18
masicadebou: C# kk, I'll give it a try

13:43:20
<transcript>: Oh yeah. Unity and C sharp. I think. I think Unity is C sharp. Yes. Use copilot. Is there anything in your cmp config for copilot? I don't see it.

13:43:24
<transcript>: I don't see it.

13:43:27
trivenge: LUL @thdxr

13:43:29
<transcript>: Maybe I don't need it in my copilot or in my lsp.

13:43:29
<transcript>: i'll say well

13:43:30
<transcript>: I'll say Well, she have here.

13:43:35
<transcript>: What's fugitive who told me about fugitive.

13:43:35
<transcript>: oh

13:43:37
<transcript>: Oh, it's a good thing.

13:43:37
thdxr: I do have one binding to accept copilot suggestions but that's it

13:43:43
juniornascm: fugitive is a git client

13:43:46
<transcript>: I've heard good things about endocri I'm getting sidetrackedracked.

13:43:46
<transcript>: i've heard really good things about

13:43:47
<transcript>: I've heard really good things about that.

13:43:48
thdxr: I never use fugitive, people love it

13:43:54
<transcript>: Do you see.

13:43:56
thdxr: also never use undo tree

13:43:57
<transcript>: No, you know uclc.

13:44:03
<transcript>: So I'm going to have to install all these things.

13:44:05
<transcript>: Like this.

13:44:07
thdxr: COC was old

13:44:09
<transcript>: This is gonna be worth it to fix my Astro.

13:44:13
kryotoboi: What if copilot uses copilot to build a project.

13:44:14
<transcript>: Okay. You also never use undetree. Okay. Cool.

13:44:17
thdxr: pre native lsp days

13:44:20
juniornascm: i have some nice dotfiles if you want to take a look: github.com/krymancer/nvim-dotfiles

13:44:21
<transcript>: I want less.

13:44:21
<transcript>: stuff

13:44:24
<transcript>: Stuff in my config. There's just so much in here and it doesn't work.

13:44:24
<transcript>: so

13:44:26
<transcript>: So it's bad.

13:44:29
<transcript>: Let's go to plugins.

13:44:33
<transcript>: I'm gonna simplify a whole lot of stuff here.

13:44:45
<transcript>: Cmp plugin. So I need all this. I don't know if I need all these.

13:44:50
juniornascm: nevermind you guys have so much stuff in nvim

13:44:52
<transcript>: Like what does a snippet. Oh, I use like the Vs code. Snippets. Yeah, that's what that is. Okay. So here lsp.

13:45:01
<transcript>: Oh, it's about to install all the things, all the things, all the things.

13:45:09
<transcript>: I like that. It auto installs all those things. I don't know. I like that anymore. Okay? Lsp zero.

13:45:09
<transcript>: snippets

13:45:16
<transcript>: Snippets. Oh, so you've got snippets built into lsp zero. How's that work? I don't know, but I'm gonna stick with that. I'm just getting rid of everything.

13:45:16
<transcript>: everything i did

13:45:20
<transcript>: Everything I did was probably dumb. Don't need any of that.

13:45:25
thdxr: also never use snippets lol

13:45:26
<transcript>: I don't need any of that.

13:45:28
<transcript>: Yeah.

13:45:35
<transcript>: So now my lsp just turned into.

13:45:42
<transcript>: All this and I'm getting rid of autocompletion stuff. All this. All of it out of here. Get out of here. Snippets out of here. Get out.

13:45:42
<transcript>: i don't want you

13:45:43
<transcript>: I don't want you.

13:45:43
<transcript>: with you

13:45:45
<transcript>: With you all.

13:45:49
<transcript>: So then what do I have? I'm down to.

13:45:49
<transcript>: i

13:45:51
<transcript>: I think normal things.

13:45:54
<transcript>: Let's see.

13:45:58
texoport: You could've used cmp-path maybe

13:45:59
<transcript>: So. Okay, what is your copilot look like.

13:46:02
<transcript>: You do copeilage.

13:46:13
<transcript>: What's light speed. Okay, so you use this one.

13:46:13
<transcript>: is that what i

13:46:14
<transcript>: Is that what I use.

13:46:20
<transcript>: Also has your trees that are configured. Sorry so many questions.

13:46:23
<transcript>: Have to tell me I'm just looking.

13:46:32
<transcript>: Tree sitter tsp update and then you have tree center plugin. Okay, similar. I have text objects and context. Oh, context is so good.

13:46:39
<transcript>: What's this? What is this? Why do I have copilot and copilot? Cmp.

13:46:42
thdxr: what's context

13:46:46
<transcript>: I'm gonna comment this one out and just see if I can get away with.

13:46:50
<transcript>: Context is the thing that.

13:46:54
<transcript>: Context is the thing that like shows you.

13:46:56
cowfacedude99: We are not getting anything done today....

13:46:58
<transcript>: See at the top.

13:46:59
kryotoboi: Oh I didn't know I looking at a pro res display screen share

13:47:03
<transcript>: See how it shows return Packer startup like it shows the top of the function there.

13:47:03
<transcript>: it like shows you

13:47:08
<transcript>: It like shows you in context, what function you're in or what block or whatever. Never use snippets. Yeah, I don't really either. I guess.

13:47:08
<transcript>: invent

13:47:11
<transcript>: Invent cloak, carpoon.

13:47:11
<transcript>: markdown

13:47:12
juniornascm: you can put copilot in the lsp-zero config to have the ghost text i think

13:47:13
thdxr: oh cool

13:47:15
<transcript>: Markdown. Preview. That sounds done. Okay.

13:47:17
juniornascm: as a  source

13:47:20
<transcript>: Doing it. We're almost done. We're almost done fixing our Astro.

13:47:20
<transcript>: conf

13:47:22
<transcript>: Config. What is bby.

13:47:25
<transcript>: Vim byebye.

13:47:28
jenswoeste: hmm... I do recognize that some devs really thrive in nvim and are able to demonstrate a really smooth flow.... But if I had a dollar for very minute I have watched a live streamer messing with nvim configrations I would not need a prime sub again.

13:47:29
<transcript>: Remember adding any of this stuff? When did I do this.

13:47:33
<transcript>: Okay.

13:47:40
<transcript>: What is formatter Inv.

13:47:44
<transcript>: invade

13:47:45
<transcript>: Invade.

13:47:55
<transcript>: Packer remap. Do you have a copilot? You said something in here.

13:48:07
<transcript>: Let's go back to your after.

13:48:11
<transcript>: Some of these subbed. I don't have another.

13:48:13
<transcript>: Sub Things, which was sub.

13:48:18
<transcript>: I don't know who it was. I hope it'll give me a notification sometimes.

13:48:18
<transcript>: i do

13:48:32
<transcript>: I do recognize that sometimes really thrive in new events and are able to demonstrate really smooth flow. But if I had a dollar for every minute I have watched a live stream or messing with the oven configuration. I would not even pronounce that again. Hey, thanks so much for the primes, perfect timing.

13:48:38
<transcript>: I really appreciate it. Yen. No, it's true. Neilvim is a hobby.

13:48:38
<transcript>: it is

13:48:43
<transcript>: It is. It's an editor. But mostly it's a hobby.

13:48:46
<transcript>: And it's one that I actually quite enjoy.

13:48:46
<transcript>: treaty

13:48:47
<transcript>: Treaty.

13:48:47
<transcript>: what do you have in here

13:48:48
<transcript>: What do you have in here.

13:48:53
juniornascm: neovim is a lifestyle

13:48:55
<transcript>: This seems better than what I have. I have so much stuff in my why don't I have some stuff in my tree setter config.

13:48:55
<transcript>: and i could just

13:48:58
<transcript>: And I could just have that.

13:49:03
<transcript>: Like, look at all this stuff. What is all this stuff.

13:49:03
<transcript>: do not

13:49:07
<transcript>: Do not have astro configured in your tree sitter.

13:49:07
<transcript>: oh

13:49:08
<transcript>: Oh.

13:49:08
<transcript>: oh

13:49:10
<transcript>: Oh.

13:49:11
<transcript>: Try.

13:49:14
<transcript>: These.

13:49:15
cowfacedude99: @juniornascm emacs is a lifestyle LUL

13:49:20
<transcript>: Oh, that's. That's important to me. The highlights. Okay.

13:49:29
thdxr: you're gonna do all this and it's still not going to work

13:49:29
<transcript>: I'm gonna leave my trees that are config but I'm doobious I don't know what all this is and why do I have Astro? If you don't have Astro in here.

13:49:29
<transcript>: like that's

13:49:33
aj_stuyvenberg: I must not be in too deep with NeoVim. I got it set up and converted from vscode in a couple hours. (This was after learning/knowing vim for a decade tho).

13:49:35
<transcript>: Like that's a question I need answered. You're gonna do all this and still not going to work.

13:49:38
<transcript>: Neil vim is a lifestyle. That's exactly right.

13:49:40
juniornascm: @thdxr yeah

13:49:44
<transcript>: Okay. Well.

13:49:58
<transcript>: Actually like my tree sitter config. I don't like how verbose it is, but let's see if that's lsp what's tree? Oh, inventory. Yeah, yeah. Okay.

13:49:59
rollie042: It doesn't matter what language or editor you write code in; only that you use tabs instead of spaces. Those space people are devilspawn, each and every one.

13:50:05
<transcript>: Plug in. So I guess with this with this lsp. Config.

13:50:05
<transcript>: i

13:50:13
<transcript>: I wonder if I need to remove Astro from my oh, and then you have the this other thing this ft detect Astro lua.

13:50:13
<transcript>: is that what

13:50:15
<transcript>: Is that what I have.

13:50:22
<transcript>: File type add extension astro astro cool.

13:50:32
<transcript>: Nothing else crazy in here.

13:50:34
<transcript>: Oh.

13:50:37
<transcript>: Oh, wait. What.

13:50:37
<transcript>: this is

13:50:38
<transcript>: This is where you do your pretty.

13:50:40
cowfacedude99: @rollie042 what about the people who use odd number of spaces...

13:50:42
<transcript>: Oh formatter? That's what formatter is.

13:50:42
<transcript>: oh

13:50:43
<transcript>: Oh.

13:50:46
<transcript>: That's how you do your.

13:50:48
<transcript>: Okay.

13:50:52
<transcript>: I guess.

13:51:02
<transcript>: So I need to I need to add formatter.

13:51:05
thdxr: idk if my formatter is good I think there's better options

13:51:07
<transcript>: I do like the idea of a plugin that just makes that easy.

13:51:11
<transcript>: Oh, cmp. I got rid of all this.

13:51:13
<transcript>: Right.

13:51:17
<transcript>: All this, all this nonsense.

13:51:17
<transcript>: i'm just getting rid of

13:51:20
<transcript>: I'm just getting rid of this whole file.

13:51:30
<transcript>: Autopayers Alpha comment copilot so formatter I'm gonna add all of your formatter stuff.

13:51:37
<transcript>: Right. Oh, there's more.

13:51:37
juniornascm: neovim gods, is there a plugin for nvim that does the same as this vscode extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow

13:51:44
<transcript>: Gonna paste that in here.

13:51:50
<transcript>: So I need to actually install that plugin.

13:51:50
<transcript>: in

13:51:52
<transcript>: In here.

13:51:52
rollie042: It's only okay if you are using the Japaense Full Width Space character

13:51:56
<transcript>: Just saw it in yours.

13:52:07
<transcript>: Where did you have that? In packer. Probably. Yeah.

13:52:09
<transcript>: Okay.

13:52:12
<transcript>: We'll do it right after.

13:52:12
<transcript>: here

13:52:14
<transcript>: Here.

13:52:19
<transcript>: Cool.

13:52:19
<transcript>: cool

13:52:22
<transcript>: Cool. Let's see if this works.

13:52:24
juniornascm: @thdxr i dont have a formater, do you have any recomendations?

13:52:32
<transcript>: But still, it's so cloning. Wow, that's taking a bit.

13:52:38
<transcript>: I don't know if I formatter is good. I think there's better options.

13:52:42
<transcript>: I was doing it through no ls, but.

13:52:49
<transcript>: I guess I'm not anymore new of him gods. Is there a plugin for nvim that does the same as this vs code extension.

13:52:53
<transcript>: Indent. Rainbow. I don't know what that does.

13:53:00
<transcript>: It's only okay if you're using the Japanese fullwidth space character. What are we talking about here.

13:53:03
<transcript>: Odd number of spaces.

13:53:08
<transcript>: Oblivious to think so chef follow.

13:53:13
<transcript>: Why is it still doing this? Is it really so cloning.

13:53:13
cowfacedude99: this comes close .https://github.com/lukas-reineke/indent-blankline.nvim

13:53:16
<transcript>: Seems like a long time.

13:53:21
<transcript>: He failed install try it again.

13:53:21
<transcript>: oh it's github

13:53:23
<transcript>: Oh, it's GitHub down.

13:53:26
<transcript>: Okay. There we go.

13:53:33
<transcript>: So then that means I don't have a null ls anymore. I guess lsp config.

13:53:33
<transcript>: this

13:53:35
<transcript>: This needs to go away.

13:53:37
<transcript>: My key binding.

13:53:37
<transcript>: so

13:53:39
<transcript>: So I'm just gonna do this. I'm gonna do.

13:53:51
<transcript>: The and then just comment it all out and then I'm gonna do same thing with null ls. This is gonna feel weird. Oh yeah, because you don't use.

13:53:54
<transcript>: Dax, you don't use a.

13:53:59
<transcript>: You don't use a linter, do you.

13:54:02
<transcript>: Get down with that.

13:54:04
juniornascm: ident-raibow colorizes the indent level, so if you miss a space or something its get mad and give an "error",  just help me visulize if i have trailing spaces

13:54:10
<transcript>: This is where this is where I did all my auto save stuff. And it felt bad. Like that felt ugly. To just get auto writing or auto.

13:54:10
<transcript>: formatting

13:54:13
<transcript>: Formatting when I save.

13:54:13
<transcript>: but

13:54:22
<transcript>: But without the extra file types on astro, how do you get prettier to do astrophiles? Oh, I have so many questions, zach. We'll see what it just does when I.

13:54:24
<transcript>: See.

13:54:27
<transcript>: No LS.

13:54:29
<transcript>: Is auto completion.

13:54:32
<transcript>: Does.

13:54:32
<transcript>: so

13:54:33
juniornascm: @cowfacedude99 i like this, will try, thanks

13:54:36
<transcript>: So any of this need to go away? I don't think so.

13:54:39
<transcript>: I don't remember what vim bbw is.

13:54:39
<transcript>: telesco

13:54:44
<transcript>: Telescope. This is broken. My SCF doesn't work.

13:54:44
<transcript>: let's give you

13:54:46
<transcript>: Let's give you eyes. Select.

13:54:55
<transcript>: Free sitter, text, object, context copilot. I got rid of this copilot cmp thing because apparently, dax was what he's talking about.

13:54:55
<transcript>: i don't know though

13:54:57
<transcript>: I don't know though.

13:55:02
<transcript>: Like I might still need that. Okay, let's just try it. Let's see what happens when I.

13:55:05
<transcript>: Run this thing probably not good things.

13:55:08
jiggaman98: You have puppy dog eyes.

13:55:13
<transcript>: Deprecated right.

13:55:16
<transcript>: If this just works.

13:55:19
<transcript>: If this just works, I'm gonna lose it.

13:55:19
<transcript>: lose my mind

13:55:21
<transcript>: Lose my mind.

13:55:25
<transcript>: Go to definition. Now does not work.

13:55:25
<transcript>: what about this

13:55:28
<transcript>: What about this? Go to definition. Why doesn't it work.

13:56:13
<transcript>: Okay.

13:56:16
<transcript>: What else could I do to try and make this work.

13:56:16
<transcript>: i feel like

13:56:22
<transcript>: I feel like I have the same setup as you now, so I'm not using Mason. It just does it for me now.

13:56:22
<transcript>: lsp support

13:56:28
<transcript>: Lsp support lsp config. Mason Mason lsp? Config. Let's go into my lsp.

13:56:28
<transcript>: what else could

13:56:31
<transcript>: What else could be different about my setup and yours.

13:56:31
<transcript>: gia server

13:56:34
thdxr: there's still one variable that's different

13:56:34
<transcript>: Gia Server Go pls Astro.

13:56:40
<transcript>: There's still one variable that's different. What is it.

13:56:40
<transcript>: oh

13:56:44
<transcript>: Oh, you're gonna say something done? Like the user.

13:56:44
<transcript>: person

13:57:01
<transcript>: What's? The variable? Go ahead, dax. What is it.

13:57:04
rollie042: I found the problem! It was between the keyboard and the chair.

13:57:06
<transcript>: Gonna say linux. Okay, that's a good one.

13:57:08
thdxr: but good job making fun of yourself!

13:57:10
<transcript>: What's this crime answer? Did you figure out how to make.

13:57:12

juniornascm: I tried to do this, but doesn't help me much

13:57:15
<transcript>: It was between the keyboard and the chair.

13:57:17
<transcript>: Good job make you put it yourself.

13:57:25
<transcript>: What's odd to me is I just ripped out and changed so much.

13:57:30
juniornascm: No, unfortunally

13:57:37
<transcript>: In my dot files and somehow nothing has changed. Like it all feels exactly the same. Like let's see if I go to a typescript file. This does it feel different? Then maybe.

13:57:48
<transcript>: Oh, I broke it. No manual entry for tokens to text.

13:57:54
<transcript>: Like I can't do now, I can't do it in my typescript files. No.

13:57:54
<transcript>: not even

13:57:56
<transcript>: Not even my type files are broken.

13:58:00
<transcript>: What did I get for all of that work.

13:58:04
<transcript>: If I do go to definition. Oh, that actually works.

13:58:11
<transcript>: It didn't take me to the definition. Unbelievable. Everything is broken. That acts. I hope you feel good about yourself.

13:58:16
cowfacedude99: check LspStatus

13:58:18
<transcript>: Didn't make me do it. Oh, I do have a lot of outdated Mason stuff, so let's do this.

13:58:21
<transcript>: Oh, wow. Like everything.

13:58:21
<transcript>: mason

13:58:26
<transcript>: Mason in Stall astro Language server.

13:58:29
<transcript>: Also.

13:58:34
<transcript>: Pr? D.

13:58:36
<transcript>: Also.

13:58:39
<transcript>: Tile.

13:58:43
<transcript>: tiler

13:58:46
<transcript>: Tiler also typescript.

13:58:46
<transcript>: langu

13:58:49
<transcript>: Language language.

13:58:49
<transcript>: server

13:58:51
<transcript>: Server.

13:58:56
<transcript>: Maybe everything will work now.

13:58:59
<transcript>: Probably not.

13:59:07
<transcript>: Let's just restart and then.

13:59:22
<transcript>: So if I'm on a gamera let's see camera entity.

13:59:22
<transcript>: and i say go

13:59:28
<transcript>: And I say, go to definition. Nope. Sure doesn't. Oh, it's more broken than ever.

13:59:31
<transcript>: Like lsp status lsp status.

13:59:35
<transcript>: More broken than ever. Not an editor command. What.

13:59:40
<transcript>: Lc info. You mean.

13:59:40
<transcript>: my

13:59:43
<transcript>: My copilot autosert, false.

13:59:43
<transcript>: what's

13:59:48
<transcript>: What's wrong here? It's not even long. It's not even Loading my.

13:59:48
<transcript>: okay i

13:59:50
<transcript>: Okay, I missed some config.

13:59:50
<transcript>: your

13:59:54
<transcript>: Your lst zero is not quite as zero as I thought. Is it.

13:59:59
<transcript>: I feel like I'm miss something.

14:00:04
<transcript>: Remap Packer set.

14:00:08
<transcript>: Lua let's go back to after.

14:00:08
shn4ke: sntKEK sntSip

14:00:13
<transcript>: Fugitive lsp. Telescope tokenite.

14:00:20
<transcript>: I copied the entire lsp file, so it's not that.

14:00:23
cowfacedude99: the tsserver root I guess

14:00:25
<transcript>: Maybe it's tree sitter. Maybe I need.

14:00:29
<transcript>: So I just need to lean into your tree center, too.

14:00:34
<transcript>: The Tsuver root, I guess.

14:00:36
<transcript>: What.

14:00:40
cowfacedude99: it is not treesitter

14:00:40
<transcript>: Like why did typescript not get lsp restart.

14:00:47
<transcript>: Why is this lsp info? Why is just copilot attached.

14:00:55
<transcript>: So this gives me hope that I can get this fixed and it'll work with astro. Two.

14:00:55
<transcript>: i think

14:00:58
<transcript>: I think just no, nothing is attached.

14:01:05
<transcript>: Nothing is attached to this. Why.

14:01:07
<transcript>: Why.

14:01:12
<transcript>: Preset recommended Set preferences.

14:01:12
<transcript>: cmp

14:01:14
<transcript>: Cmp.

14:01:22
<transcript>: Why do we think nothing is attached.

14:01:26
<transcript>: Configure tsr? Oh, right here.

14:01:26
<transcript>: so

14:01:31
<transcript>: So you tell root pattern pmp yarn.

14:01:35
<transcript>: So this is it. This is my issue.

14:01:38
<transcript>: This config. Somehow.

14:01:40
aqua_fortuna: If it is a ts file, have you install: npm install -g typescript typescript-language-server

14:01:46
<transcript>: If it is a ts file you have install.

14:01:47
cowfacedude99: can you push your non-working config to github?

14:01:57
<transcript>: Mpm install typescript type language server. Yeah, no, I've got that aqua, but welcome to Chat. I've definitely got the typescript language over installed. Can you push your non wiki working config to GitHub.

14:01:59
<transcript>: Yes.

14:02:05
<transcript>: Is not tree setter. I'm not interested. Or am I. I'm in my no, I'm in my plugins right now.

14:02:05
<transcript>: but

14:02:11
<transcript>: But ts over here where we configured ts server. It's got to be something that this can take, I guess.

14:02:18
<transcript>: Lsp zero implies I have to do zero. And it should just work.

14:02:21
<transcript>: Also very possible.

14:02:25
<transcript>: I've got some stuff still broken in here.

14:02:30
<transcript>: What is all this? Yeah, let me push it up.

14:02:30
<transcript>: i'll push it

14:02:32
<transcript>: I'll push it up for you.

14:02:56
<transcript>: I'm scared to push this to my doppo's. I guess I can always revisit revert the commit.

14:03:00
<transcript>: You need lc setup server server name. Oh, where's that.

14:03:07

14:03:17

14:31:09
iterm11: isn't copilot no longer free?

14:31:42
<transcript>: Try that.

14:31:44
sockthedev: or free if you have oss contributions to some arbirtary tier

14:31:49
<transcript>: If it works now.

14:31:59
sockthedev: all my burnout finally paid dividends

14:32:00
spain: Do you know what technology chatgpt uses to send a stream of text? Like it types word for word instead of making you wait for the entire response

14:32:03
<transcript>: I can welcome to Chat. Isn't Cop out no longer free? Yeah, I actually pay for it. I've paid for it since I could pay for it. I love copilot. I think it's fantastic.

14:32:08
<transcript>: Take a shot every time someone is banned in chat.

14:32:08
<transcript>: it's not very

14:32:09
<transcript>: It's not very often.

14:32:13
<transcript>: Or free if you have oss contribution.

14:32:13
<transcript>: contribution

14:32:16
<transcript>: Contributions to some arbitrary tier. Interesting.

14:32:19
<transcript>: Oh, my burnout finally paid dividends.

14:32:26
<transcript>: Do you know what technology Chat dbt uses to send a stream of text like it types wordforword instead of making you wait for the entire response.

14:32:30
<transcript>: I do not Spain, but I do plan to play with that.

14:32:30
<transcript>: with that ap

14:32:32
<transcript>: With that api. That is.

14:32:34
<transcript>: And.

14:32:38
<transcript>: When I do.

14:32:38
<transcript>: i

14:32:41
iterm11: @sockthedev like on your own oos repos or other repos?

14:32:43
<transcript>: I will find out and if you're around, I would love to let you know how it works.

14:32:50
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. We can see if copilot works now. I guess we'll find out in here.

14:32:51
spain: okay :D

14:32:58
<transcript>: So I wonder if this works now, like, inside this tag. Nope. Okay. So that's like probably my tree setter problem.

14:33:02
sockthedev: i invited other collobarators and they got the free copilot, so i guess others too

14:33:02
<transcript>: So that's gonna be.

14:33:04
<transcript>: Defensive.

14:33:07
<transcript>: And this is. Oh, no.

14:33:07
<transcript>: that's wrong

14:33:09
<transcript>: That's wrong.

14:33:09
<transcript>: offense

14:33:09
fitzsimons_dev: yeah how many contributions do you need to make that count?

14:33:11
<transcript>: Offense, rebound.

14:33:15
<transcript>: Well, that's compiler.

14:33:19
<transcript>: And this should be.

14:33:19
<transcript>: defensive

14:33:19
sockthedev: no idea

14:33:20
<transcript>: Defensive.

14:33:31
<transcript>: Okay, it's defensive rebounds. And then we're back to Unidented stats.

14:33:32
iterm11: because I have some oos repos but got no free copilot :(

14:33:33
<transcript>: What's the next one.

14:33:34
fitzsimons_dev: thats a cool motivation for open source tho

14:33:42
<transcript>: Assist steele's Box turn of a personal file. So let's just knock these out real fast, and then we can get on to pressing matters.

14:33:42
<transcript>: i already forgot

14:33:44
<transcript>: I already forgot. What was it.

14:33:47
<transcript>: Blocks, assists.

14:33:47
<transcript>: steals

14:33:49
<transcript>: Steals. Blocks. Okay.

14:33:58
sockthedev: yeah, it is a sweet recognition by them

14:34:03
<transcript>: Oh, Nope.

14:34:04
<transcript>: This.

14:34:11
<transcript>: Locks.

14:34:14
<transcript>: Want to say.

14:34:17
<transcript>: Steals.

14:34:33
<transcript>: And blocks.

14:34:36
stiefbroerikzitvast: instead of jjjj you can type 4j (im a vim GOD)

14:34:38
<transcript>: Almost there.

14:34:42
<transcript>: Turnovers and personal fouls.

14:34:42
<transcript>: turn

14:34:44
<transcript>: Turn over.

14:34:48
sockthedev: oss can be pretty toxic though

14:35:01
<transcript>: And personal foul fouls. Last one personal.

14:35:01
<transcript>: foul

14:35:03
<transcript>: Fouls.

14:35:05
fitzsimons_dev: I haven't had any of those experiences thankfully

14:35:11
<transcript>: Alright.

14:35:11
<transcript>: let's look

14:35:14
<transcript>: Let's look and see. Does all the data look right.

14:35:19
<transcript>: Let's kind of line these up just like the same.

14:35:20
sockthedev: i created my sockthedev alt because people would come hunt me down on twitter etc to ask me to approve pull requests, and request features, help etc

14:35:30
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the follow person to follow me Edward Error Edward lrick thank you so much that follow Edward.

<transcript>: Very much on a Monday morning.

14:35:37
sockthedev: i've moved away from oss now.

14:35:37
<transcript>: Data looks the same, we're good.

14:35:37
<transcript>: we're

14:35:39
iterm11: yeah me neither thank god but I don't have something like a 100k users lib

14:35:40
<transcript>: We're good. Okay, so things that are next.

14:35:45
<transcript>: Next I need to get this Explorer.

14:35:49
<transcript>: Explore, thing, explore, but I'm gonna do it.

14:35:51
<transcript>: A little bit differently.

14:35:51
<transcript>: not

14:35:53
<transcript>: Not with that.

14:35:57
<transcript>: Additional questions.

14:35:57
<transcript>: so i'm

14:36:00
<transcript>: So I'm gonna do it.

14:36:00
<transcript>: in the layout

14:36:05
<transcript>: In the layout file which makes sense that the player now let's do it in the game layout file.

14:36:18
<transcript>: But there's no bio. It's data.

14:36:21
<transcript>: Have additional questions on it.

14:36:25
<transcript>: Visual.

14:36:27
<transcript>: Oh, There it is.

14:36:28
tropichana: What api do you use to get the stats?

14:36:29
<transcript>: It is.

14:36:29
<transcript>: just like

14:36:31
<transcript>: Just like that.

14:36:31
<transcript>: too easy

14:36:32
<transcript>: Too easy.

14:36:32
<transcript>: data

14:36:35
<transcript>: Data. That domain, maybe.

14:36:37
<transcript>: Data. Dot.

14:36:39
<transcript>: Visual.

14:36:39
<transcript>: that

14:36:40
<transcript>: That.

14:36:43
<transcript>: Domain. There it is.

14:36:43
<transcript>: okay

14:36:45
<transcript>: Okay.

14:36:52
<transcript>: What do we think? What do we think? What do we think? Let's.

14:36:54
<transcript>: See how that looks.

14:37:00
<transcript>: Ooh, looks bad.

14:37:03
<transcript>: So what is different here.

14:37:07
<transcript>: Thanks so much for the follow. Cryo.

14:37:12
<transcript>: What api do you use to get the stats? So we have our own staff database.

14:37:29
kryotoboi: I forgot to follow all this while NotLikeThis

14:37:29
stiefbroerikzitvast: `:.,+3s/turnovers/personalFauls/`

14:37:32
<transcript>: And we got that one instead of jj, you can type four. J. I'm a. Vimgod. Thank you, Step ro, I'm so bad with the jays in the caves. I'm constantly Jing and King and constantly doing other horizontal navigation things, too. They're bad. I'm bad at horizontal and vertical navigation, but I am.

14:37:32
<transcript>: good

14:37:34
<transcript>: Good at.

14:37:41
stiefbroerikzitvast: the replace vim stuff is powerful

14:37:41
<transcript>: Savings so that my new of M works. I don't know. I can't think of anything I'm good at.

14:37:41
<transcript>: so we

14:37:47
<transcript>: So we have our own sas database. We hired a statistician that worked here for, like, five years.

14:37:47
<transcript>: and then

14:37:48
<transcript>: And then.

14:37:53
<transcript>: We license all that data, and we keep it updated.

14:37:53
<transcript>: and

14:37:59
<transcript>: And the api is like a natural language api that we built that can answer questions.

14:38:10
<transcript>: Now we're.

14:38:13
<transcript>: Cryo.

14:38:13
<transcript>: it's all right i'm sure

14:38:15
<transcript>: It's all right. I'm sure a lot of you aren't following.

14:38:17
<transcript>: That's okay.

14:38:17
<transcript>: as long as

14:38:23
<transcript>: As long as you come back I don't care if you follow me, But I think if you follow me you're probably more likely to come back So I do love when you follow me.

14:38:26
<transcript>: Maybe check and see if you're following me.

14:38:26
kryotoboi: I have a feeling that Adam is a lisp fan

14:38:33
<transcript>: If you're not going take care of that. I have a feeling animals a list fan. I've never done anything.

14:38:40
<transcript>: Did I have like a.

14:38:43
<transcript>: Was there something weird in the output.

14:38:43
<transcript>: plus

14:38:46
<transcript>: Plus threes turnover. Personal vows.

14:38:46
<transcript>: spot on

14:38:47
thdxr: he meant you have a lisp

14:38:49
<transcript>: Spot on Things About Prime Sub Wow.

14:38:53
axxeltatto: hi i'm late , you pay for this api?

14:38:55
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, step ro, I could have done replace stuff. Yeah.

14:38:55
<transcript>: you meant

14:38:57
<transcript>: You meant I have a list.

14:38:59
<transcript>: Ouch.

14:38:59
<transcript>: ouch

14:39:00
kryotoboi: LUL No..

14:39:00
<transcript>: Ouch.

14:39:00
<transcript>: do i have a lift

14:39:03
<transcript>: Do I have a lift? I might have a list.

14:39:03
<transcript>: i then have

14:39:05
<transcript>: I then have an ozarks twang.

14:39:10
<transcript>: Axle. Hi. I'm late. You pay for this api? No. We built it.

14:39:15
<transcript>: So, Sat News is a venture backed startup. We've been around since 2014.

14:39:22
<transcript>: So I guess our venture capitalist investors pay for it. They pay for the data and the API.

14:39:31
<transcript>: Was it gonna do? Oh, yeah? I was gonna make this look better.

14:39:35
spotmonk: I'm usually pretty picky who I give my free sub to, but I've been here every day last week and today, so I figured I should use it here :D

14:39:40
<transcript>: We're gonna try pasting it down below. Let's try this.

14:39:42
<transcript>: Is that better? No, that's worse.

14:39:42
<transcript>: good to know

14:39:43
<transcript>: Good to know.

14:39:48
<transcript>: Martin margin bottom. So we want to.

14:39:52
<transcript>: There's just so much about this. That's bad.

14:39:52
<transcript>: i guess

14:40:00
<transcript>: I guess that's why on the live site we put it in a little box, but if you look like a player profile, so let's click on a player.

14:40:03
<transcript>: Just go to the mavericks page.

14:40:08
<transcript>: And if we go to Lucas page.

14:40:08
<transcript>: so i

14:40:13
<transcript>: So I player. This is what their Explorer looks like. Like that, right.

14:40:13
<transcript>: it's the same

14:40:15
<transcript>: It's the same width as all this stuff.

14:40:15
<transcript>: but on the

14:40:19
<transcript>: But on the game page that looks real bad.

14:40:24
<transcript>: So instead, on the live site, we do this. We put it in this little box.

14:40:24
<transcript>: i don't know

14:40:29
<transcript>: I don't know. It looks pretty bad in the box too, but that lets us put this ad here.

14:40:29
<transcript>: little

14:40:31
<transcript>: Little trivia muse.

14:40:35
<transcript>: Little trivia, Little trivia game? That's fun.

14:40:47
kryotoboi: I found out marvel has a free API. I have been wanting to build something awesome out of it but got no ideas. Don't wanna build a superhero directory

<transcript>: I found out Marvel.

14:41:18
<transcript>: has

14:41:25
<transcript>: Has a free api. I've been wanting to build something awesome out of it but got no ideas. Don't want to build a superhero directory.

14:41:25
<transcript>: there's a marvel

14:41:27
<transcript>: There's a Marvel api, that's kind of cool.

14:41:27
<transcript>: ooh

14:41:29
<transcript>: Ooh, cryo.

14:41:29
<transcript>: no joke

14:41:31
<transcript>: No joke.

14:41:37
<transcript>: When we went, we were in the Disney accelerator.

14:41:37
<transcript>: we got to meet with

14:41:40
<transcript>: We got to meet with all the like Disney executives.

14:41:40
<transcript>: and

14:41:41
<transcript>: And.

14:41:41
<transcript>: sherwood

14:41:44

14:41:47
<transcript>: Ben Sherwood.

14:41:47
<transcript>: yeah

14:41:47
spotmonk: you should make up stats for marvel characters. Like villains defeated and stuff

14:41:48
<transcript>: Yeah, that's him.

14:41:48
<transcript>: then

14:41:52
<transcript>: Then at the time I don't know if he's still what his current role is.

14:41:52
<transcript>: at the time he was

14:41:54
<transcript>: At the time he was ahead of ABC.

14:42:02
<transcript>: And when we showed him stat muse, he said, you should make pop muse, you should make a pop culture.

14:42:06
<transcript>: Like searching or search engine.

14:42:09
<transcript>: And just have like Disney characters and stuff like that.

14:42:09
<transcript>: so

14:42:12
<transcript>: So someone tried to tell us we should do that.

14:42:15
<transcript>: We could use a Marvel api guess for that.

14:42:15
<transcript>: but maybe yeah

14:42:16
<transcript>: But maybe Yeah.

14:42:16
<transcript>: maybe that should exist

14:42:20
<transcript>: Maybe that should exist. Maybe there should be a Marvel.

14:42:22
<transcript>: Directory superhero director.

14:42:30
<transcript>: Sp trimble thank you so much for joining us in Chat and Slow Con. Thanks for the follow.

14:42:36
stiefbroerikzitvast: what stats do you need from Mickey Mouse?

14:42:40
heresmeep: as a guy who has probably seen an obscene amount of basketball stats. Who is your favorite basketball player?

14:42:40

14:42:41
adamdotdev: !pictures

14:42:47
<transcript>: go follow him

14:42:48
<transcript>: Go follow him.

14:42:55
<transcript>: Should make up stats for Marvel characters like villain's defeated. That would be awesome. Actually.

14:43:02
slowcon: no problem. are both your keyboards using Mode Signal switches? they sound real nice

14:43:05
<transcript>: You talk about how Statmes makes money. Yeah. So we we make money off ads. So the site does like, I don't know, 50 million page views a month. Something like that.

14:43:05
<transcript>: so

14:43:09
<transcript>: So we make money off ads. We have a shop like merch.

14:43:27
<transcript>: We we actually power some in Stadium apps for teams. So like in Stadium apps where you go to, like, staples center to a Lakers game. And there's a Lakers app. Well, you can, like, answer or ask questions about stats. And we answer those questions. So we have some deals around that stuff.

14:43:27
<transcript>: we

14:43:30
statsndata: Does Statmuse's TOS cover web scraping? Or is there a page on the site?

14:43:31
<transcript>: We had an ESPN deal for a long time. I don't know where that stands.

14:43:31
<transcript>: but

14:43:41
<transcript>: But we're working on what I'm working on here right now on Stream. After we rewrite this thing and ask ro, it's like a subscription model for journalists.

14:43:41
<transcript>: sports better

14:43:49
<transcript>: Sports better people who use statmeys to research we don't offer more tools to them to make it easier to research sports stuff and create content.

14:43:56
<transcript>: There will be some kind of paid tier for that. So that's kind of how we make our money today.

14:43:57

<transcript>: But like active players, I don't really follow the NBA that closely anymore, which is sad because I'm working on stat, muse.

14:44:32
<transcript>: I don't really have a favorite current player, I guess.

14:44:37
glamshatterskull: i don't like michael jordan LUL

14:44:37
<transcript>: I don't watch it to have one. I know like the players that are really good.

14:44:37
<transcript>: like

14:44:40
<transcript>: Like luca, and.

14:44:40
<transcript>: i don't know

14:44:41
<transcript>: I don't know.

14:44:43
glamshatterskull: olajuwon for life

14:44:44
<transcript>: Joker.

14:44:44
<transcript>: fit

14:44:48
<transcript>: Fits him in. Yeah. Music news would be probably pretty good, too. That's a good point.

14:44:59
<transcript>: Slow, Con. Welcome to Chat. No problem or both your keyboards using mode signal switches. Yes, slowcon, they are. I've got mode signal switches on both this ad and my mode sonnet.

14:44:59
<transcript>: i've

14:45:12
<transcript>: I've got some other weird switches, not mode switches on my other keyboards, but I do think the most signals which just sound really good. Does that uses terms of service, cover web scraping? Or is there a page on the site.

14:45:16
<transcript>: I don't know. We get scraped a lot.

14:45:16
<transcript>: we are going

14:45:22
<transcript>: We are going to try to figure out who's scraping and why not because we care, but because we want to offer this.

14:45:27
<transcript>: One understand their use case like if you're scraping status.

14:45:27
<transcript>: you have

14:45:37
<transcript>: You have use cases to use status without using the natural language stuff. And we want to understand those so that we can maybe think about products we should offer, like a paid api or something.

14:45:41
<transcript>: So we know we get scraped a lot there. I don't know if it's in our terms of service.

14:45:47
<transcript>: It should be mandatory for all Disney Top Management to change your names to cartoon characters.

14:45:51
thdxr: how many lines of code is in statmuse

14:45:53
<transcript>: Are you independently bootstrap Lender or vc funded? So Fitzmon, we are funded by so we raise.

14:45:53
<transcript>: it's been

14:46:04
heresmeep: its gotta be atleast 7 @thdxr

14:46:06
<transcript>: It's been like six, seven years ago, we raised an a $10 million series. A Disney led the round. Google was in the round. So it's kind of like a strategic, but also there's some venture capitalists obviously involved.

14:46:13
stiefbroerikzitvast: 10 million?!

14:46:15
<transcript>: Mostly in like the media space. And then we've raised the series B, which is still kind of.

14:46:16
sj_se: scraping is an iffy area legally depending on how to present your data. LinkedIn hasnt had much luck preventing it from a legal standpoint.

14:46:17
stiefbroerikzitvast: for a simple astro site?

14:46:20
<transcript>: Opaque to me. I wasn't as involved in the Bee so I don't know all the details.

14:46:20
<transcript>: but

14:46:30
<transcript>: But a lot of that was around, like, the money stuff. That mewes.com money. So a lot of the B was raised off of doing, like, these things.

14:46:31
statsndata: Simple haha

14:46:37
<transcript>: What's the return of Nike this quarter? So like, we have financial search as well, not just sports.

14:46:44
<transcript>: It's statmese.com money. And you can ask questions like, Well, was the return of Nike this quarter.

14:46:44
<transcript>: so i think we

14:46:47
<transcript>: So I think we raised our B off of a lot of this.

14:46:52
<transcript>: So the investors involved there were more interested in the financial stuff.

14:46:52
<transcript>: how

14:46:53
fitzsimons_dev: yeah there's a lot of cool features to statmuse it's not just the ui lol

14:46:59
<transcript>: How many lines of code in statmezo. Geez, I don't even know. How do you quickly find out? I don't even know how to find out.

14:47:06
<transcript>: Oh, you don't like Michael Jordan, glam. Oh, a lot. Right? Right. Rockets.

14:47:06
<transcript>: it's got to be

14:47:10
<transcript>: It's got to be at least seven. I think we've seen at least seven on Stream today.

14:47:12
schrew: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

14:47:13
jenswoeste: ive got those exact sneaks

14:47:31
<transcript>: That's a good burn sick burn. Sj scraping is an iffy area legally, depending on how to present your data, LinkedIn hasn't had much like preventing it for the legal standpoint. Yeah. I mean, like we're a small startup, so even if we put it in our terms of service and you scrape us so we're not gonna go after you. We just don't have the I mean, if it's something.

14:47:39
<transcript>: Egregious where somebody took down status because they're just slamming us so hard. Then maybe we had to figure out how to I don't know, but yeah, we're not really.

14:47:41
<transcript>: Too upset about it.

14:47:49
<transcript>: There's a lot of cool features to Sam use is not just ui. That's right. Lots of cool stuff. We're doing all kinds of stuff. We actually built like a oneoff.

14:47:56
<transcript>: Ar App for the Profitball Hall of Fame. It's so random.

14:47:56
<transcript>: pro

14:48:00
<transcript>: Pro Football Hall Of Fame.

14:48:00
<transcript>: talking

14:48:02
spotmonk: I don't know anything about the NBA, other than playing NBA Jam TE. And I always shot 3 pointers, so my favorite players are John Stockton and Reggie Miller?

14:48:06
<transcript>: Talking Madden so me and a couple of other statmes team members built.

14:48:08
<transcript>: This thing.

14:48:14
<transcript>: Where is it? Where is it? Yeah, this thing.

14:48:19
<transcript>: I don't know how much it says on this page.

14:48:28
<transcript>: Hey, there's me set. Adam elmore haha it's been a privilege of being involved in such amazing project that prefers John's Legs use there's a powerful way.

14:48:28
<transcript>: so we built

14:48:32
<transcript>: So we built this. There's Actually, there's a USA today.

14:48:37
<transcript>: Madden, talking.

14:48:44
<transcript>: There's an article that has a video on it, I think. Yeah, right here. So we built this back in, I guess. What was it? 2019.

14:48:44
<transcript>: it's

14:48:53
kryotoboi: As a stratup founder what would you suggest. I have been with a startup for over 6 years now. Building features day in and out. But at this point its kinda driving itself into a wall. Should I stick or abandon ship ?

14:48:56
<transcript>: It's so random, it's literally an AR app where you could hold up the AR app in front of John Men's bus. And like the real Bus, got replaced with a digital one that we had.

14:49:00
<transcript>: Actually had an Activision artist he works on World of Warcraft.

14:49:07
<transcript>: An artist named chung, who recreated the butt. Well, actually. So. Okay, hang on.

14:49:07
<transcript>: i'm

14:49:10
<transcript>: I'm gonna come over here and tell the whole story.

14:49:12
<transcript>: This is one of those things.

14:49:12
<transcript>: i did

14:49:17
<transcript>: I did. And I meant to write, like a blog post about it or something. And I never did.

14:49:17
<transcript>: and

14:49:18
<transcript>: And.

14:49:18
<transcript>: the

14:49:33
<transcript>: The story of it has been lost in the ether. I've never documented it. There's photos, there's a lot of stuff from behind the scenes. It was really cool, actually, and I just never really put it out there. So I spent so much time in canton, actually, where the Profitba Hall famous Museum is.

14:49:43
<transcript>: Doing all kinds of weird stuff. They got to know me pretty well. So we took 3d scanners out there and scanned John Man's bus. We scanned like a dozen Bucks.

14:49:43
<transcript>: because we were

14:49:46
<transcript>: Because we were kind of working on different players as well.

14:49:46
<transcript>: so we scaled

14:49:53
<transcript>: So we scaled it with the 3d scanner, got this really good mesh, and then hired this Activision artist who created.

14:49:53
<transcript>: different

14:49:57
<transcript>: Different. I can remember blend shapes I think is the name.

14:49:57
<transcript>: basically

14:50:02
<transcript>: Basically different like poses for different parts of the face so that.

14:50:02
<transcript>: and here's where

14:50:10
<transcript>: And here's where it gets really cool, so that we could drive it with this facial motion capture stuff that I built. Okay. This is so random.

14:50:10
<transcript>: and

14:50:26
thdxr: adam u r special

14:50:30
<transcript>: And what's cool about this project is, like, I don't I don't like, puff myself up much like I'm not I don't think I'm that special, but I did do this project in a very short amount of time, and it's kind of insane everything we did. So we had to do this in, like, a month time period before the Super Bowl. They were gonna, like, launch this thing at the Super Bowl in Atlanta, which I got to go to you are.

14:50:30
<transcript>: special thanks

14:50:32
<transcript>: Special thanks, sack.

14:50:52
<transcript>: So the Super Bowl in Atlanta, they have this big, hard date where we have to have it done. And they didn't greenlight the project. We didn't get man in the booth until, like, a month before the Super Bowl. So we had a month to build this insane amount of technology. So I took on an ipad. There is a it's the true depth camera. It's like they're 3d camera on the.

14:50:52
<transcript>: ipad

14:50:57
<transcript>: Ipad. You don't talk about that. I'm on phones now, too, right? But it's called a true depth camera.

14:50:57
<transcript>: and

14:50:58
<transcript>: And.

14:50:58
<transcript>: you can use

14:51:08
<transcript>: You can use an sdk on an Apple device to actually get all the motion captured data off of the sensor. So we took the raw data from the same.

14:51:22
<transcript>: Plugin. And we went out to California and sent in a studio with John madden for a few hours and just interviewed him. We had one of our employees, one of our content people write a script and did a really great interview. But he just sat there with my ipad.

14:51:22
<transcript>: and the

14:51:30
<transcript>: And the ipad truedepth cameras watching him the whole time we're recording, we're in a professional sound Studios, his studio. So it's really good audio, but we cast.

14:51:30
<transcript>: data

14:51:33
<transcript>: Data at the same time as the audio.

14:51:33
<transcript>: off the true depth camera

14:51:53
<transcript>: Off the true depth camera. And I had I built this unity plugin where I could watch in real time, the actual bus being animated off of his performance. So we're watching him. He's setting, you know, on the other side of the glass of the sound booth holding this ipad spitting all over it. I got pictures of the ipad. It was just covered in spit because he's an old guy. And he's just, like, holding that like this.

14:51:53
<transcript>: but

14:51:58
<transcript>: But we could watch and make sure it's actually picking up the data in a way that we can animate with it.

14:51:58
<transcript>: so we

14:52:07
<transcript>: So we record for a few hours, this huge interview. We have all of your files. We have all this motion captured data. The raw motion captured data from the sensor.

14:52:08
thdxr: did you pull his dna off the spit

14:52:10
thdxr: and clone him

14:52:14
thdxr: better than a bust

14:52:16
<transcript>: And we took all that data, and we drove this rig. So we had this Activision artist build a rig, basically a 3d rig that we could then power.

14:52:16
<transcript>: off of mot

14:52:18
<transcript>: Off of motion captured data. So then.

14:52:18
<transcript>: we took

14:52:36
kontr0ll: @thdxr You don't have to feed a bust though.

14:52:39
<transcript>: We took it another step. And we said, Well, what we do at stat muse is natural language stuff. So you ask a real question just in English, and we give you a answer. So we built, like, a very light conversational model that you could say things like, hey, John Man, what was it like to win the Super Bowl? And then he would go into some story that we recorded about what it was like to win the super. So we had, like, I don't know.

14:52:40
<transcript>: Two, three dozen.

14:52:40
<transcript>: stories that

14:52:47
<transcript>: Stories that we recorded from him. They were like, the most iconic moments of his career. Like, what was it like to be carried off the field? You know, what was.

14:52:47
<transcript>: i don't know

14:52:56
<transcript>: I don't know the story about like he would never get on a plane, like he had his own bus. And he would drive to every game like he did not fly. He refused.

14:53:00
kryotoboi: Oh do clones need food ?

14:53:03
<transcript>: So we had all these stories and then just like routed you to these different stories based on what your question is.

14:53:23
<transcript>: In a really cool experience, but it's so random. And oneoff and the only reason statues that we did it was like we had a free of a friend that was John maddens agent and got connected to them because they had wanted to build this. John madden in his like, profane proof of Fame acceptance speech, he made a joke about how he.

14:53:23
<transcript>: thinks the bus

14:53:43
<transcript>: Thinks the bus talk to each other when the lights are turned off at night. And so he always wanted to see them do some exhibit where the bus actually talk. And this agent got wind of, like, these cool, stat people that are doing statues. Maybe they could build it. That was it. It was like, hey, we think you guys could build this. Could you build it? It has nothing to do with what we're doing, but we built it. We did it like, a month.

14:53:43
<transcript>: it was fun

14:53:44
<transcript>: It was fun.

14:53:44
<transcript>: okay

14:53:48
<transcript>: Okay. That's a big long story. Thank you so much for the follow. Elizabeth J.

14:53:49
tropichana: That‚Äôs really cool experience you should blog it

14:53:51
<transcript>: jee did you

14:53:51
<transcript>: jee did you put

14:53:54
<transcript>: Jee, did you put his Did you pull his DNA off the spit.

14:53:59
<transcript>: That's funny Lord gucci things of Chef hollow.

14:53:59
<transcript>: contra

14:54:05
<transcript>: Contra, Contra control. Welcome to Chat. You don't have to feed a bus, though it's true.

14:54:13
<transcript>: And we actually we didn't just do John Man. So we did. John madden. Thanks for that. Follow. Here is meat.

14:54:13
<transcript>: we

14:54:18
<transcript>: We did John madden, and then they wanted to do another bust.

14:54:18
<transcript>: and we kind of had

14:54:22
<transcript>: And we kind of had the process down at that point. So we did Michael Strahan.

14:54:24
<transcript>: Michael.

14:54:24
<transcript>: stray

14:54:32
<transcript>: Stray and Justin Spencer. Thanks so much for Ray. Let's see if my confetti still works. It does. Thanks so much for the Raid. And welcome, welcome.

14:54:32
<transcript>: i

14:54:42
<transcript>: I should blog about it. It's been like three years ago. Now Michael strahan talking bus. So this one was cool because I got to go to New York.

14:54:42
<transcript>: and

14:54:48
<transcript>: And we filmed like a little thing for The Good Morning Show. What's the Show called Good Morning America.

14:54:48
<transcript>: so

14:54:51
<transcript>: So this is another thing we did.

14:54:56
<transcript>: I'm not gonna play the video, but, well, you can kind of see, like.

14:54:56
<transcript>: we

14:54:58
rupertorio: Hi how are you? What are you talking about? I just connect

14:54:59
<transcript>: We had the whole talking bus. There.

14:55:04
<transcript>: And it was like a dumb gag. Where is it? Yeah. So he's like, talking to them.

14:55:15
<transcript>: In the middle of Times Square. It was actually pretty fun because I got to set there and drive the rig based off the I don't know. The director was like telling us how to do it anyway.

14:55:15
<transcript>: that was fun

14:55:25
<transcript>: That was fun. We actually recorded Strahan a couple times. What else did? We did something else with stray hand. I've met straight in like three times because of statme is randomly.

14:55:36
<transcript>: Okay, I'm done. Rupert? Hi. How are you? What are you talking about? I just connect. Talking about sat mews. Just weird things we've done at statmeas.

14:55:39
<transcript>: We've done some weird things.

14:55:39
<transcript>: we for a while

14:55:43
thdxr: do you not use an adblocker adam

14:55:46
<transcript>: We for a while there we were kind of trying to figure out what we were. And we were just like a little digital media lab building around.

14:55:46
<transcript>: random stuff

14:55:47
<transcript>: Random stuff.

14:55:49
thdxr: supporting statmuse I see

14:55:58
<transcript>: Do I not use that blocker? I don't. I don't even know what an ad blocker is. Honestly, like, people talk about them all the time. Like, what is is it a Chrome extension? What is an ad blocker.

14:56:01
rupertorio: aww okay. Thank you for the update

14:56:02
<transcript>: Excuse me.

14:56:07
<transcript>: No problem. Rupert.

14:56:08
thdxr: I use ublock origin

14:56:08
rupertorio: yes is a chrome extension

14:56:09
<transcript>: Okay. I'm gonna put this stuff in a box.

14:56:12
kryotoboi: Stat muse has an API ?

14:56:20
<transcript>: Oh, in a box like that? I don't love it, I don't love the box. Yes. Is a Chrome extension. Okay, you block origin. Sounds fancy.

14:56:21
thdxr: don't put me in a box

14:56:22
kontr0ll: Or a Firefox extension, if you swing that way. ;)

14:56:26
sockthedev: you don't use a blocker!

14:56:28
<transcript>: Don't put me in a box. I don't like this in a box. Can I not do it in a box.

14:56:28
<transcript>: could i

14:56:30
sockthedev: dude

14:56:32
<transcript>: Could I just fix the margin or something.

14:56:36
<transcript>: Could I just make it fit the width of this thing and call it good.

14:56:49
sockthedev: ublock origin is a requirement for a sane internet

14:56:51
<transcript>: It also needs some like March and top or something. Let's just see whatever I'm just gonna make it look like the site now and then we'll fix it later. I should be my default when in doubt make it look like the site does today.

14:56:53
<transcript>: And then.

14:56:56
<transcript>: We can make it better later.

14:56:58
<transcript>: Okay.

14:57:05
kontr0ll: Sad, but true. It shouldn't have to be that way.

14:57:06
sockthedev: guessing adam's surfing is super clean though üòÖ

14:57:08
<transcript>: So this is it right here.

14:57:14
<transcript>: Oh, there's like scripts and stuff feels bad.

14:57:15
rupertorio: I would ad drop shadow to that boxes, if you are going that way

14:57:25
<transcript>: Age three. Oh, is that it? It's literally just at a margin. Top to it. No, that's not it.

14:57:26
mehulsharmamat: hello everyone!

14:57:28
<transcript>: That's not it.

14:57:33
<transcript>: Can't be it.

14:57:37
daglee: If you are using safari, there is an built in adblocker.

14:57:37
<transcript>: What is all this? Oh, I regret, I regret it.

14:57:43
<transcript>: I regret.

14:57:43
<transcript>: i regret

14:57:46
<transcript>: I regret all my life twist what did I do here.

14:57:49
<transcript>: Safari has a built in ad blocker.

14:57:55
<transcript>: What is all this? No, undo. Okay. Undo, undo.

14:57:55
<transcript>: turns out

14:57:57
<transcript>: Turns out bad idea.

14:57:59
<transcript>: I just need to tweet.

14:57:59
<transcript>: we need to tweak

14:58:06
<transcript>: We need to tweak not redo. So if I look at the explore thing, I just need to put a margin top six on it.

14:58:06
<transcript>: and then i need

14:58:08
<transcript>: And then I need to.

14:58:08
<transcript>: what

14:58:09
<transcript>: What.

14:58:14
daglee: I'm using it when I use adblocking in webkitgtk. :)

14:58:16
<transcript>: I guess put a border on it. The border.

14:58:19
<transcript>: We're gonna not make the border black.

14:58:23
<transcript>: So we're gonna say margin, top.

14:58:23
<transcript>: argentop

14:58:28
mehulsharmamat: psyched to start a new project - hopefully should be done in some hrs (I'm doing the horrible thing of estimating things as an engineer)

14:58:29
<transcript>: Argentop six. And we're not gonna make the border black, okay.

14:58:37
<transcript>: That's the list.

14:58:43
<transcript>: So we're gonna wrap it in a div. Maybe now I'll just do it here.

14:58:49
<transcript>: Okay. That should make it look like it does today.

14:58:55
<transcript>: It does make it look like it does today.

14:58:55
<transcript>: it doesn't make me

14:58:57
<transcript>: It doesn't make me like it anymore.

14:59:01
<transcript>: Well, if we're just putting a border on it, we don't need a border.

14:59:01
<transcript>: let's just not

14:59:03
<transcript>: Let's just not put the border on it.

14:59:03
<transcript>: and let

14:59:12
<transcript>: And let's just say at least we put some margin top on it, but this needs to be reworked. That's terrible. Okay. Cool. So we need some design help on that.

14:59:12
<transcript>: but

14:59:14
<transcript>: But it's good enough.

14:59:19
<transcript>: And I'm not gonna put the ad stuff in yet. We'll circle back to that.

14:59:19
heresmeep: is SST similar to the serverless framework?

14:59:22
<transcript>: Let's see. Hello, mayhew. What's going on.

14:59:31
<transcript>: I would add drop shadow to that boxes if you're going that way. Yeah, we're not gonna do boxes around stuff. Everything in Sam use is a very flat design. We shouldn't have.

14:59:31
<transcript>: shadows

14:59:35
<transcript>: Shadows or borders like that? I don't like it.

14:59:43
<transcript>: You don't use a blocker you block origin is a required for thin internet really.
