<transcript>: trying to get

00:12:26
<transcript>: Trying to get your mind made up on Mode keyboards. Oh, mode keyboards. I was just thinking about keyboards yesterday. I mean, I own four or five of them, so I think about them all the time, actually, six of them. Oh, let's build the new one.

00:12:26
<transcript>: i'm so

00:12:42
<transcript>: I'm so excited to build a new one because, well, it's it's bittersweet. On one hand, I'm so excited to build a new one because I have a wooden it's like a custom wide Oak accent. If you know the sonic keyboard, it has like a little accent bar on the face of it like that. You see when you look down on it.

00:12:57
tymekdev: I am looking into getting an Envoy. I am thinking on getting all the possible plates to test out what are the differences

00:12:58
<transcript>: I have a wide Oak one, and it's gonna look so good in my office. It's a white keyboard. So I have a white base. I think I did the silver base, but it's a white top. It's gonna have that wooden accent. It's just gonna look like my house. My house just looks like wide Oak and white painted walls.

00:12:58
<transcript>: i'm very excited about

00:13:00
<transcript>: I'm very excited about it.

00:13:00
<transcript>: on the other hand

00:13:04
<transcript>: On the other hand, I'm not excited because I'm gonna have to loop all the switches.

00:13:04
<transcript>: and

00:13:12
beeut: Hey VoHiYo

00:13:14
<transcript>: And the stabs. And I'm terrible at it. And it's not gonna sound as good as this one. It's gonna look amazing. I'll be good for going on this play. It'll be a great display. Keyboard.

00:13:14
<transcript>: i just won't use it

00:13:16
<transcript>: I just won't use it because I won't sound as good as this one.

tymekdev: Though there is such a variety of variants for coloring it is such a tough decision to make!

00:13:32
<transcript>: As someone said.

00:13:32
<transcript>: timek said

00:13:34
<transcript>: Timek said it's in the odds.

00:13:34
<transcript>: so

00:13:38
<transcript>: So there's that. And then I don't know. Everything else is just.

00:13:43

ayoungh: What is gods?

00:13:54
ayoungh: Vods

00:13:54
<transcript>: There on github. If you want to take a look at those, it's a next js app that just runs locally. They can do anything on my machine and a node process that I want to do.

00:14:02

<transcript>: Good Morning, Jr.

00:15:35
mecoupz: it's lunchtime here in europe (austria)

00:15:44
<transcript>: I had a great day off yesterday. My wife and I went to Kansas City, had a great time. We spent 6 hours in the car for a four hour trip. I mean, we were there for 4 hours enjoying kins City four and a half.

00:15:44
<transcript>: it's a three

00:16:03
<transcript>: It's a three hour trip, one way. So just to fit inside of our kids awake window like we leave right after we kiss them in the morning. We're like, goodbye. We love you. And then we laugh because we don't want them to wake up to nanny and not feel like they knew we're we were. So we waited, we say goodbye. We take off and we got to get back for bedtime.

00:16:10
<transcript>: So it was fun, though. We had a lot of fun for only being there for 4 hours. I'm gonna spend 6 hours in the car talking. So that was nice.

00:16:19
<transcript>: Let's see. 08:00. A.m.. Here. So you're on the East Coast of North America. I keep looking down it keeps zooming in on my face.

00:16:27
<transcript>: I'm looking into getting an envoy. I'm thinking on getting all the possible plates to test out. What are the differences.

00:16:37
<transcript>: Tomic your cup from my cloth. I have all of the 65 back plates. I've got one of every color. And I have all of the.

00:16:37
<transcript>: sonnet insert

00:16:53
<transcript>: Sonnet inserts. So when I see something like that where there's, like, 15 different colors of it, I get them all and then I think I can flop them out. I can change them out when I want to. I'm the same way with cables. I've got different keyboard cables from a keyboard. I just like to build like, you know, really.

00:16:53
<transcript>: match everything

00:16:54
<transcript>: Match everything.

00:16:54
<transcript>: make sure

00:16:57
<transcript>: Make sure it's all aesthetically pleasing to me.

00:17:06
<transcript>: Oh, and you're talking about the plates. I'm sorry. The plates, like the carbon fiber.

00:17:06
<transcript>: and

00:17:08
daglee: And apple laptops! ;)

00:17:08
<transcript>: And whatever.

00:17:09
tayloreddev: i'm not rich enough for this hobby LUL

00:17:18
<transcript>: Copper plate. They have. I've got a brass plate. I think I've got a bunch of those, too. I think I got all the plates just because I want to know how they all feel. Yeah.

00:17:22
<transcript>: For what it's worth the keyboard I love the most is the one I'm using today.

00:17:22
<transcript>: which

00:17:24
<transcript>: Which has a copper plate.

00:17:24
<transcript>: i don't know

00:17:26
<transcript>: I don't know.

00:17:26
<transcript>: there you go

00:17:27
<transcript>: There you go.

00:17:30
<transcript>: Beat is here.

00:17:30
<transcript>: though

00:17:42
<transcript>: Though there is such a variety of variants for coloring. Is such a tough decision make? Yeah, it's tough. I think the envoy has even more possibilities than any of the others. Like you can do more to customize the envoy. They have more combinations.

00:17:46
<transcript>: A young vods that's the video on demand.

00:17:46
<transcript>: that's like

00:17:51
funkysetiz: @TayloredDev haha same

00:18:00
ayoungh: Thanks

00:18:01
<transcript>: Twitch stores your vods for like seven days or something.

00:18:15
<transcript>: I to suck at lubing. I've only did that for one keyboard. Practice. Makes perfect, right? Yeah. I don't know. Sometimes I think I should just, like, pay somebody to loop them for me so that they sound good, because I only have, like, six keyboards. I don't want to let.

00:18:15
<transcript>: practice and

00:18:27
<transcript>: Practice and then never make another keyboard. I'm probably not gonna make a lot of keyboards. Some of I'll ever get good enough. In fact, if there's anyone in my chat that love lubing keys or switches, I will mail you my switches.

00:18:27
<transcript>: for you to

00:18:30
<transcript>: For you to loop. I will pay you for it. So just let me know.

00:18:32

joostschuur: Well don’t do all that work just for me :)

00:19:29
<transcript>: I'm not rich enough for this hobby.

00:19:33
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. First time chatter funky.

00:19:35
<transcript>: Same.

00:19:40
<transcript>: Thanks. Only six keyboards? Yeah mode got me hooked.

00:19:40
<transcript>: they got me

00:19:49
<transcript>: They got me hooked on their keyboards. I really do think Mode makes the best keyboard if you're just like concerned with build quality and aesthetic.

00:19:49
<transcript>: okay maybe

00:19:52
<transcript>: Okay. Maybe aesthetics. That's why more subjective.

00:19:52
<transcript>: so

00:20:04
<transcript>: So in terms of aesthetics, I know people are gonna love their type of keyboard like everybody has their own. But in terms of build quality, I can't imagine there are any keyboards with better build quality than these mode keyboards they are.

00:20:04
<transcript>: fantastic

00:20:06
<transcript>: Fantastic.

00:20:06
<transcript>: they're very expensive

00:20:07
<transcript>: They're very expensive.

00:20:10
<transcript>: I don't know. They're very expensive, but they're pretty extensive. Keyboard.

00:20:13
<transcript>: But the build quality.

00:20:13
<transcript>: is nuts

00:20:15
beeut: Have you ever been in Europe?

00:20:18
<transcript>: Is nuts. Like I got one of those Advantage 360s when they were very limited.

00:20:18
<transcript>: very hard

00:20:25
<transcript>: Very hard to get hold of. It was just like I had to find a way to get a hold on. And I had heard everybody say, like the build quality of them is just unparalleled.

00:20:25
<transcript>: i was not impressed

00:20:27
<transcript>: I was not impressed.

00:20:29
<transcript>: I mean it's plastic.

00:20:36
<transcript>: I'm sure they're great for what they are, but like I was spoiled on most where everything is metal and amazing.

00:20:36
<transcript>: and

00:20:38
<transcript>: And anyway.

00:20:41
<transcript>: Perira thanks so much follow.

00:20:41
<transcript>: first follow

00:20:43
<transcript>: First follow of the morning.

00:20:51
<transcript>: andy

00:20:57
mecoupz: yeah but they're ergonomic. i can't use normal keyboards anymore, my hands hurt. i need ergonomic kb's

00:20:58
<transcript>: Andy thinks so much that follow you're probably not here. Probably asleep right now. And Hunter, you also followed me while I was sleeping.

00:20:58
<transcript>: thanks so much

00:21:00
<transcript>: Thanks so much for those follows.

00:21:10
<transcript>: There's this guy who I follow. I see that he has switched looping service. Ooh. Thank you. Time. Act. I will reach out.

00:21:10
<transcript>: don't do all that

<transcript>: yeah juice

00:21:15
sj_se: missed the stream yesterday

00:21:21
<transcript>: Yeah. Juice. I don't know. Can I put it on sale? I can just put on soundcloud, I think. Or maybe I'll just share a Google Drive link. You'll have to download it and listen to it like the old napster days.

00:21:26
<transcript>: I bet it's a bunch of ginsers in my chat right now and you don't even know what Mapstra is.

00:21:26
<transcript>: pole

00:21:31
<transcript>: Pole who knows what napster is? I'm not gonna actually do a bold cause I'm lazy but napster, anybody.

00:21:31
<transcript>: sj

00:21:33
funkysetiz: yes

00:21:38
daglee: I know napster

00:21:38

00:21:51
funkysetiz: I used napster old napster

00:21:51
<transcript>: Went to the niagara Falls in high school.

00:21:51
<transcript>: but

00:21:53
joostschuur: I remember the modem sound when you went online

00:21:59
<transcript>: But, yeah, I spent a couple weeks in an orphanage in Mexico. That is the only trip outside the US I've ever been on.

00:21:59
<transcript>: and i

00:22:01
<transcript>: And I have a passport.

00:22:01
<transcript>: but

00:22:03
<transcript>: But I never use it.

00:22:03
<transcript>: either

00:22:15
<transcript>: Either. Ergonomic. I can't use normal keyboards anymore. My hands hurt. I need ergonomic keyboards. Okay, that makes sense. I know people like the. Like the concaveness.

00:22:15
<transcript>: i

00:22:18
<transcript>: I just care so much about the way a keyboard looks.

00:22:18
<transcript>: man

00:22:20
schererja: and then well limewire, and kazaa

00:22:21
<transcript>: Man, my thing is zooming on me a lot.

00:22:21
<transcript>: i

00:22:26
<transcript>: I care so much about the way it looks and I just can't do the split keyboard thing. I don't know.

00:22:38
<transcript>: For some reason, it just doesn't do it for me. I also love the sound of my keyboards, and if I can't control the way they sound, that's a bummer too. And I think the advance 360 you're kind of limited there.

00:22:42
<transcript>: Dagling those Napster funking, Those Napster.

00:22:45
<transcript>: Juice obviously knows Napster.

00:22:50

<transcript>: i

00:22:59
<transcript>: I miss napture. At least Old napster. Is there still, master.

00:23:06
joostschuur: (I’m 51 but young at heart)

00:23:20
<transcript>: Napture was the best. So is my tunes. What was my tube? I didn't know that one. I remember the whole metallic of the baccal. Anybody listened to a dispatch on napster? I got into dispatch on napster, and then it turned into, like, our favorite band. My brother and I, we went to like, Boston to the last dispatch, which ended up being like the.

00:23:20
<transcript>: i don't know

00:23:28
<transcript>: I don't know. Twelve to Last dispatch. They've done, like a dozen concerts since then, but at the time, it was like, this is official. They're ending it.

00:23:28
<transcript>: it was crazy

00:23:34
<transcript>: It was crazy time. 2000 people outside in Boston, pouring into the river is amazing.

00:23:42
<transcript>: Okay. I used Napster, old Napster. So people are making me think there's a new Napster.

00:23:42
joostschuur: Young at heart is a euphimism for refusing to ‘refusign to acknowledge aging'

00:23:47
<transcript>: Juice. I remember that modem sound.

00:23:54
sj_se: mytunes let you browse and download songs from other iTunes libraries on the same network you were connected to. back in 2004 - 2005ish

<transcript>: And I couldn't use the internet if my brother wanted to use the phone.

00:23:55
<transcript>: they either get so

00:24:01
<transcript>: They either get so pissed. Except my sister. She had her own phone line so she could call people.

00:24:08
<transcript>: She had one of those, like, transparent phones, because, like, see all the insides of it. I remember that very distinctly.

00:24:13
<transcript>: And then lime wire. Remember lime wire. I don't remember kaza.

00:24:13
<transcript>: although

00:24:14
funkysetiz: there's a streaming napster thing now I think

00:24:16
<transcript>: Although it's starting to jog my memory kaza.

00:24:16
<transcript>: kind of familiar

00:24:17
<transcript>: Kind of familiar.

00:24:17
<transcript>: i have new fe

00:24:22
<transcript>: I have new fee and I like the color of the spacebar. New fees are nice. I've seen those.

00:24:22
<transcript>: fifty one bit

00:24:24
okufa_f: a lot of sibling rivalry in your household growing up?

00:24:25
<transcript>: 51 bit young at heart so I hear juice.

00:24:32
<transcript>: No matter your age, you always feel the same like you always feel young.

00:24:32
<transcript>: my grand

00:24:41
<transcript>: My grandma is 90 something and she says she still feels young, like her brain doesn't feel any like her mind is in any older.

00:24:41
<transcript>: it's

00:24:45
<transcript>: It's interesting. I feel that way. I've never felt not that way.

00:24:50
<transcript>: Young at heart is a euphemism for refusing to.

00:24:53
<transcript>: Refuse, refusal.

00:24:59
<transcript>: Refuge? What is that? Am I saying that right.

00:24:59
<transcript>: i

00:25:05
<transcript>: I feel like that's a really obvious way and I'm just. I'm blanking. Yeah. Hi is a youthinism for refusing to.

00:25:11
<transcript>: Oh, it's supposed to be refusing again? Refusing to refusing to acknowledge.

00:25:18
<transcript>: Aging. I think I just got so mixed up with the type of there I think it's refusing again.

00:25:22
mecoupz: i think adam added gpt-4 to his "zoom into my face" thing haha

00:25:24
schererja: English is hard LUL

00:25:26
joostschuur: This is exactly what gets me! When we see old people who cannot express themselves anymore, we forget that they still feel young inside.

00:25:26
daglee: Imagine aliens coming to earth in 1000 years, visiting adams house. "These humans have to have 6 arms".

00:25:26
<transcript>: Okay, SJ my tunes like you browse and download songs from other itunes libraries on the same network you were connected to. Wow.

00:25:26
<transcript>: that

00:25:31
<transcript>: That's hardcore land parties let's steal each other's itunes.

00:25:36
<transcript>: There's a streaming Napster thing now, I think. Okay, interesting.

00:25:42
joostschuur: Typos kill me sometimes. ADHD typing

00:25:45
<transcript>: A lot of sibling rivals in your household. Growing up, not too much. I did have three siblings, so two brothers and a sister. I'm gonna still have two brothers and a sister.

00:25:51
<transcript>: I wouldn't say a lot of rivalry. I mean, we were obviously like we were pretty close to age.

00:25:53
<transcript>: So like.

00:25:53
<transcript>: you know normal

00:25:54
<transcript>: You know normal stuff.

00:26:04
<transcript>: Fighting over the whatever you'd normally fight over. I don't know. I don't think it was, like, more than normal sibling library rivalry. We're all really close.

00:26:04
<transcript>: my sister

00:26:07
<transcript>: My sister was the oldest.

00:26:07
<transcript>: she

00:26:08
<transcript>: She's.

00:26:14
<transcript>: Six years older than me. Six years, I think. No.

00:26:18
<transcript>: She no she was born.

00:26:21
<transcript>: Yeah. Yeah. Six years older. I just said, do the math. Sorry.

00:26:26
<transcript>: Then my brother. I have a two year older and a two year younger brother.

00:26:26
<transcript>: i think anim

00:26:29
<transcript>: I think animated gpt four to Zoom into my face.

00:26:32
<transcript>: It's really sensitive today.

00:26:32
<transcript>: it keeps pop

00:26:34
<transcript>: It keeps popping in.

00:26:34
<transcript>: jumping

00:26:36
<transcript>: Jumping in on my face.

00:26:36
<transcript>: english

00:26:44
<transcript>: English is hard. This is exactly what gets me when we see old picture or old people who cannot express themselves anymore. We forget that they still feel young inside. Exactly.

00:26:52
<transcript>: Imagine aliens coming to Earth in 10 years. Visiting Adam South. These humans have to have six arms.

00:26:52
<transcript>: six keyboard

00:26:55
<transcript>: Six keyboards. That's funny.

00:26:58
<transcript>: Okay.

00:26:58
<transcript>: so today

00:27:07
<transcript>: So today we're gonna rebuild stammes.com like we have been everyday pinky, but also a couple random things I'm gonna do.

00:27:11
mecoupz: no face expressions allowed for adam today to not trigger his zoom-into-face thing :D

00:27:11
<transcript>: One. I have this idea, and I can't get it out of my head.

00:27:11
<transcript>: and it

00:27:14
<transcript>: And it involves gpt, four.

00:27:14
<transcript>: and then the other thing

00:27:15
<transcript>: And then the other thing.

00:27:16
<transcript>: Involves a lot.

00:27:19
joostschuur: Take over the world!

00:27:35
<transcript>: In EC, two instances, which are maybe the two. Those might be the two most opposite things in technology is gpt Four, the coolest, newest hottest thing, and elastic beanstalk, which is a service that I kind of hate, but it kind of made sense for this thing. I needed to throw together in, like an hour.

00:27:35
<transcript>: and

00:27:39
okufa_f: yesterday my twitter timeline consisted of 75% chatgpt4

00:27:43
<transcript>: And it's for Watch Dev our discord server. So there that's what we're doing today. I think we're gonna start with that little watch side that thing because I'm almost done with it.

00:27:45
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:27:45
<transcript>: yesterday

00:27:56
<transcript>: Yesterday, my Twitter timeline consists of 90 or 75% chat gpt Four it really is gpt Four has taken over the Twitter sphere. The fact that can process images is in it.

00:27:56
<transcript>: opens

00:28:00
<transcript>: Opens up a whole bunch of new stuff. A whole bunch of ideas.

00:28:08
<transcript>: No face expressions allowed for Adam today to not trigger his Zoom in the face thing. Yeah, I'm gonna give people motion sickness.

00:28:12
<transcript>: Sky keeps super neutral face.

00:28:17
okufa_f: i think the next step is to be able to search the web in real time

00:28:23
<transcript>: It's really sensitive today. It really pops in there fast, doesn't it? You see that like I make a face.

00:28:24
mecoupz: HAHA

00:28:28
<transcript>: It's on it. It's on top of it. Okay.

00:28:28
<transcript>: i think the next

00:28:31
<transcript>: I think the next step is to be able to search the Web in real time.

00:28:31
<transcript>: yeah oh

00:28:33
<transcript>: Yeah oh yeah once.

00:28:33
<transcript>: gpt

00:28:37
<transcript>: Gpt Four is like online once it can like.

00:28:37
<transcript>: have up to

00:28:51
<transcript>: Have up to date just even up to date information. Even if you can't like paste links in and just get like to know what that is, even if it could just be up to date, not back in 2021. I don't know how big of a technical feat that is, but once they get there once it's like always up to date.

00:28:55
<transcript>: Void C thanks so much following.

00:28:55
<transcript>: and

00:29:07
<transcript>: And I guess with the amount of characters or tokens you can input now 320 inputs or whatever. I guess now you can drop whole web sites or hold docs or whatever in there.

00:29:07
<transcript>: like you don't

00:29:11
juniornascm: I think GPT is beging updated, at least in some info

00:29:15
<transcript>: Like you don't even need it to be fully up to date and you can still get really useful information. We're gonna play with it on stream today because I have some ideas.

00:29:15
<transcript>: about things

00:29:18
mecoupz: i think gpt-4's internal codename is probably skynet 0.7

00:29:20
<transcript>: About things that would make my life easier as a developer. Okay, let's get to it.

00:29:31
fragaverage: if you still own the domain, public.dev could be repurposed for a list of built in public projects and links to the streamers/youtube channels etc. With the code itself open source so people can PR to add new projects

00:29:31
<transcript>: What are we looking at? We're looking at my obs. That's not what I want to look at.

00:29:31
<transcript>: this

00:29:34
<transcript>: This is what I want to look at, though.

00:29:42
<transcript>: Thanks for that follow c's. Artif.

00:29:42
<transcript>: ca

00:29:57
juniornascm: But i dont know it is only learning from people or is accurate information

00:30:02
<transcript>: Caesar caesar dev. If you still own the domainpublic, dev could be repurposed for a list of builtin public projects and links to the streamers YouTube channels with the code itself open source so people can PR to add new projects. Frag I don't need new ideas for public dev. I need to spiritually disconnect from public dev. It's been a very painful.

00:30:02
<transcript>: thing

00:30:03
fragaverage: LUL

00:30:04
<transcript>: Thing for me.

00:30:08
<transcript>: And even if someone had the best idea in the world.

00:30:13
fragaverage: Give me the domain ffs 😂😂

00:30:14
<transcript>: And maybe that one is. I just can't. I can't go back to that domain.

00:30:14
<transcript>: it is too painful

00:30:15
<transcript>: It is too painful.

00:30:15
<transcript>: and

00:30:17
<transcript>: And give me the domain.

00:30:22
<transcript>: What's, $800 a year. That's the other problem. It's like I've had the domain for three years.

00:30:22
<transcript>: and for

00:30:27
<transcript>: And for six months of that, I thought I had a project going on it, and then I abandoned.

00:30:27
<transcript>: but

00:30:31
<transcript>: But three years is a long time to pay for an 800 all domain that you don't use.

00:30:36
juniornascm: WOW, thats expensive

00:30:38
<transcript>: So if you want to pay a month or a year for it, it's all yours. How about that.

00:30:38
foobfoob: for a SaaS project with some standard auth/dashboard/whatever functionality, would you still use nextjs for this?

00:30:46
<transcript>: Yeah, the short onename. Dev domains. They're expensive, and I have a bunch of them, and I gotta stop.

00:30:46
<transcript>: for a

00:30:49
fragaverage: I'll DM you on discord later

00:30:52
<transcript>: For a sas project with some standard authentic word, whatever functionality would you still use next? Yes. For this.

00:30:57
<transcript>: Yeah. I think next year's. Great. If you're if you're building a spa kind of thing.

00:30:57
<transcript>: you got a dashboard

00:30:59
<transcript>: You got a dashboard, all that stuff.

00:30:59
<transcript>: i think

00:31:04
tayloreddev: I've got many domains that i've yet to do anything with

00:31:06
<transcript>: I think Nick jess is great. I'm kind of falling out of love with React personally, but that's like a personal preference thing.

00:31:10
<transcript>: And I think it still makes a lot of sense.

00:31:14
cazcik: you guys been liking cloudflare?

00:31:17
<transcript>: Yeah, frag shoot me up or not shoot me up shoot me a dm yes. Hit me up.

00:31:27
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: What are you replacing React with?

00:31:28
<transcript>: I've got many domains that I've yes to doing with yeah, don't we all tailor? If someone could figure out how to, like, turn domains into like, I don't know.

00:31:28
<transcript>: bitcoin

00:31:30
<transcript>: Bitcoin or something.

00:31:30
<transcript>: devs

00:31:38
<transcript>: Devs would buy that thing like crazy. Could we just, like, repurpose all our domains and to turning in them into something I don't know.

00:31:38
<transcript>: you guys been

00:31:40
<transcript>: You guys been liking cloud flare.

00:31:40
<transcript>: catholic

00:31:41
<transcript>: Catholic.

00:31:43
juniornascm: Has been a while that i dont use any js framework. I was falling in love with Solid JS

00:31:48
<transcript>: You talk about me and Statme's, because why not? I don't think Samue's is using CloudFare for anything, but I'm using it for some things.

00:32:08
<transcript>: What am I replacing React with? Well, I've just. I've been working on Sam use. It's not a very interactive thing. It's not a spa. It's just a bunch of pages. So for statues, I've not had to replace React with anything. I'm just building a lot of servicegenerated Astro stuff, but my plan is to get into solid when I do want to build another spa.

00:32:08
<transcript>: that's

00:32:10
<transcript>: That's the plan.

00:32:10
<transcript>: has been

00:32:21
<transcript>: Has been a while that I don't use any js framework. I was falling in love with Soljist. Yeah, Junior, that's. That's my next plan. I know people like that speak really highly of Solid. So that's the plan.

00:32:27
okufa_f: is the mobile statmuse app built in react native?

00:32:27
<transcript>: Okay, let's let's finish this dumb thing that I'm doing for watching Dev.

00:32:32
<transcript>: Watch? Oh, Jeez.

00:32:32
<transcript>: i

00:32:34
ali___999: hey adam, hows it goin?

00:32:38
<transcript>: I never want siri to respond to me. Why do? Or how do I turn that off.

00:32:52
<transcript>: Okay. So this is a dumb little thing that is gonna be connected to the discord api at all times. That's the reason it has to be an EC two instance or something that can have a persistent websocket connection.

00:32:52
<transcript>: to discord

00:32:54
okufa_f: solid's syntax is pretty similar to react, pretty easy to switch over

00:33:02
<transcript>: To discord. I don't know how to do that without, like, I want to just use serverless stuff, but I feel like this is gonna have to actually be an easy to instance. Which makes me sad. Makes me very sad.

00:33:06
<transcript>: And what is wrong here.

00:33:06
fragaverage: I use Heroku for stuff like that

00:33:13
<transcript>: Okay, I'm almost done with that. This is the actual code that's gonna, like, update everybody's roles.

00:33:13
<transcript>: i might

00:33:20
<transcript>: I might just have to duplicate it because this looks like it's not gonna work. What's? What's wrong here? Rolls.

00:33:24
fragaverage: Which I guess is just an EC2-like service

00:33:25
<transcript>: Doesn't have a has. So what is this type of question.

00:33:29
<transcript>: New roles.

00:33:31
<transcript>: Build member.

00:33:31
<transcript>: role manager

00:33:32
<transcript>: Role manager.

00:33:32
<transcript>: and this is

00:33:37
<transcript>: And this is a collection. String, roll, roll resolvable.

00:33:48
leonardssh22: role.cache.has

00:33:49
<transcript>: What is this new mail member is a guild member. Okay, so it needs to be rolls cache up here.

00:33:56
<transcript>: Okay. So I think if I do that.

00:33:56
<transcript>: i don't even need to do that

00:33:58
<transcript>: I don't even need to do that. I'm just gonna say.

00:33:58
<transcript>: member

00:33:59
<transcript>: Member.

00:33:59
<transcript>: member

00:34:01
<transcript>: Member Oops.

00:34:03
<transcript>: Number, dots.

00:34:06
<transcript>: Member dot.

00:34:10
<transcript>: You can't get over how much Fold reminds me of like talking heads.

00:34:14
<transcript>: Why doesn't this work.

00:34:14
<transcript>: oh cuz it's

00:34:17
<transcript>: Oh, cuz, it's got to be Rolls cache, I guess.

00:34:26
<transcript>: Okay, so this will work. This is the dumb thing I'm doing where I'm just trying to sign. If you're not familiar.

00:34:28
<transcript>: You're not familiar.

00:34:28
<transcript>: use

00:34:35
<transcript>: Use heroku for stuff like that? Yeah. Didn't heroku die or something? I don't know. Just started costing money, so stopped using it.

00:34:35
<transcript>: it's the mobile

00:34:45
okufa_f: heroku got rid of their free tier

00:34:46
<transcript>: It's the mobile Sat Mesapp built in React native no Akufa. It's just built in like Swift, just Native Swift. And we counter regret it if I'm being honest.

00:34:46
<transcript>: we wish we

00:34:47
fragaverage: They removed the free tier yeah

00:34:51
<transcript>: We wish we had Android support, but we don't Ali it's going well, how are you.

00:34:58
<transcript>: Yes, solid syntax is pretty similar to React. The implementation very different. The runtime much smaller.

00:35:02
<transcript>: And just feel simpler like you don't have to have react brain anymore.

00:35:02
<transcript>: as zach says

00:35:04
<transcript>: As zach says.

00:35:07
<transcript>: They remove the freeze here. Okay.

00:35:07
<transcript>: that's

00:35:12
<transcript>: That's why I thought, what was I doing? I was oh, yeah? I was gonna say.

00:35:12
<transcript>: discord

00:35:12
adamdotdev: !discord

00:35:12
fossabot: Adam is a member of the watch.dev Discord server and he'd love to see you there: https://discord.gg/watchdotdev

00:35:25
<transcript>: Discord discord. So the watch Dev discord server. It's gonna be a play where you can come and hang out with any devs that stream. And if you're a dev that streams and you want to have a channel on this server, reach out to me and.

00:35:25
<transcript>: we're working on

00:35:27
<transcript>: We're working on that.

00:35:27
<transcript>: and this is

00:35:32
<transcript>: And this is what I'm building right now is a little thing that's gonna keep all the Rolls up to date.

00:35:32
<transcript>: it switched to

00:35:37
<transcript>: It switched to my moving camera, and for some reason the moving camera wants to look at the floor.

00:35:37
<transcript>: so

00:35:41
<transcript>: So sorry. You can't see my screen. There it is. There's my screen.

00:35:47
<transcript>: Get a little too creative with these moving cameras. I need to settle down.

00:36:07
<transcript>: So what it's going to do is assign the subscriber role to anybody that subscribes to any of the streamers. So if you subscribe to me, you're gonna have access to this sub only channel. But if you subscribe to dax and you don't subscribe to me, you'll also have access. So if you subscribe to any one of us.

00:36:19
<transcript>: There you go. And maybe we'll do something where, like, if you subscribe to a bunch of us, you get extra perks. I don't know. But that's what I'll do in this little discord bot. Okay, so here this is going to be.

00:36:23
<transcript>: Update.

00:36:23
<transcript>: update

00:36:27
<transcript>: Update number roll. Nope, not that Nope.

00:36:27
<transcript>: what

00:36:28
<transcript>: What.

00:36:28
<transcript>: what happened

00:36:30
<transcript>: What happened.

00:36:30
<transcript>: here we go

00:36:31
<transcript>: Here we go.

00:36:31
<transcript>: update

00:36:32
<transcript>: Update.

00:36:32
<transcript>: member

00:36:34
<transcript>: Member roles.

00:36:34
<transcript>: new

00:36:37
<transcript>: New member is gonna be.

00:36:37
<transcript>: a new

00:36:39
<transcript>: A new member.

00:36:41
<transcript>: Is that async.

00:36:44
<transcript>: No.

00:36:49
<transcript>: Okay. So we could just say new.

00:36:49
<transcript>: role we could

00:36:52
<transcript>: Role we could just say no.

00:36:56
<transcript>: Cash.

00:36:56
<transcript>: okay

00:36:57
<transcript>: Okay.

00:36:57
<transcript>: oh

00:37:07
<transcript>: Oh, here is what happens when if your roles update. So if you subscribe to somebody on Twitter, that's one of us. It's going to.

00:37:09
<transcript>: Update your roles.

00:37:09
<transcript>: and also

00:37:13
<transcript>: And also at the very beginning, we're gonna fetch all the members.

00:37:13
<transcript>: and for

00:37:15
<transcript>: And for each member.

00:37:15
<transcript>: we're going

00:37:17
<transcript>: We're going to.

00:37:21
<transcript>: Update Member roles.

00:37:34
<transcript>: Okay. I think that's it. This is the code. Let's go. I'm gonna just run it on my local machine and see if it works.

00:37:34
<transcript>: what do i

00:37:38
<transcript>: What do I need to pass in I need discord secret ARN.

00:37:41
<transcript>: That's the only environment variable, I guess.

00:37:46
<transcript>: Okay. I could have made this. I should make this environment variable as well.

00:37:49
<transcript>: Build ID. I'm not going to it doesn't matter.

00:38:03
<transcript>: Okay, so I just need to put the discord secret AR in into an environment variable. I should be able to run this thing.

00:38:06
<transcript>: Let's do let's see.

00:38:06
<transcript>: pmp

00:38:08
<transcript>: Pmp, and build.

00:38:12
<transcript>: Then we're gonna say this, Gordon.

00:38:12
<transcript>: server

00:38:23
<transcript>: Server. No, this board secret ARN equals. And now I need to look up the discord. Secret ARN. Okay, I'm gonna go fuzzy. Just because I don't remember.

00:38:23
<transcript>: if

00:38:26
<transcript>: If this thing is visible, okay, cool.

00:38:29
<transcript>: No discord word. Where are you.

00:38:38
<transcript>: Thanks so much. Follow Albert.

<transcript>: I love you Keys so much.

00:38:48
<transcript>: i just get

00:38:52
okufa_f: i gotta say, you have the best streaming dev steup

00:38:56
<transcript>: I just get such a little like feeling of joy every time I touch my ubiki and I think there's no one someone can hack this account. They would have to have my UB key.

00:38:59
<transcript>: A coofa. Thank you so much.

00:39:04
<transcript>: Thank you so much that I have the best streaming dev setup.

00:39:04
<transcript>: high accol

00:39:06
<transcript>: High accolades from a kufa this morning.

00:39:06
<transcript>: how do i

00:39:16
<transcript>: How do I change it to Dark Mode? Why is this not Dark Mode? Now watch me get really obsessed with making this doc Dark Mode. It's been the next 30 minutes.

00:39:27
<transcript>: I found it. Sorry. You guys are still in fuzzy, and I'm just messing with Dark mode. Okay, say settings. That feels better. My eyes.

00:39:27
<transcript>: just breath

00:39:31
<transcript>: Just breathe the sigh of relief if I could breathe.

00:39:35
<transcript>: They sure did. Okay. Sickness. Manager. I'm almost done.

00:39:44
<transcript>: Discord is the okay here's the secret AR? N that's not sensitive so I can share my screen now.

00:39:46
<transcript>: I just need to do this.

00:39:50
<transcript>: And then I can say, what.

00:39:51
<transcript>: This.

00:39:51
<transcript>: node

00:39:53
<transcript>: Node node.

00:39:56
<transcript>: Dis slash.

00:39:56
<transcript>: what is it

00:39:58
<transcript>: What Is It? Index.

00:40:00
<transcript>: What is the name of the file? Yeah. Index.

00:40:00
<transcript>: index

00:40:03
<transcript>: Index js thanks for watching. Follow.

00:40:07
<transcript>: Somebody followed me. Thanks. I follow polar Div.

00:40:07
<transcript>: i appreciate

00:40:09
<transcript>: I appreciate it.

00:40:09
<transcript>: and i got

00:40:14
<transcript>: And I gotta say, Albert, lithium, your username just reminded me of a good song.

00:40:14
<transcript>: lithium

00:40:15
<transcript>: Lithium.

00:40:15
<transcript>: okay

00:40:21
<transcript>: Okay. Token Invalid. I thought I didn't know what the Tokyo. The token actually should be.

00:40:21
<transcript>: so

00:40:23
<transcript>: So you reminded me of a song.

00:40:23
<transcript>: by

00:40:24
<transcript>: By.

00:40:32
<transcript>: Nirvana, lithium anybody anybody think for that follow leaf.

00:40:43
<transcript>: Lace. Okay, this isn't sensitive. I'm not leaking anything that's just my air in. I do need to figure out, where is the discord discord app token? Because I think I put the wrong value in there.

00:40:43
<transcript>: how to get

00:40:45
<transcript>: How to get your discord token.

00:40:48
fragaverage: Lithium reminds me of Evanesence LUL

00:40:50
<transcript>: Go to the discord website.

00:40:53
<transcript>: Developer tools.

00:41:00
<transcript>: I shouldn't be opening Dev tool.

00:41:04
<transcript>: No, no, bot token. Here we go.

00:41:10
<transcript>: Do okay. I've done that. Applications. Give your bottom name.

00:41:13
<transcript>: Where's the token.

00:41:20
<transcript>: But Where's the tokens? Oh, my goodness. So many words. I just needs, like, one picture that shows me where the token is.

00:41:20
<transcript>: client secret

00:41:21
<transcript>: Client secret.

00:41:21
<transcript>: is

00:41:25
<transcript>: Is it that retrieve your token.

00:41:25
<transcript>: bot

00:41:26
<transcript>: Bot.

00:41:26
<transcript>: what

00:41:27
<transcript>: What.

00:41:30
<transcript>: Add bot.

00:41:30
<transcript>: oh

00:41:33
<transcript>: Oh, I have to wait. What.

00:41:35
<transcript>: That was a lot.

00:41:35
<transcript>: so

00:41:37
<transcript>: So wait a minute.

00:41:43
<transcript>: So it's not just an app. I have to. I have to create a bot.

00:41:43
juniornascm: Yeah

00:41:48
<transcript>: Oh, the web is so broken, the ads, I just can't handle it, it's so broken.

00:41:58
smilingbig: true

00:41:58
fragaverage: so much revenue! LUL

00:42:00
juniornascm: You have to create a bot in the app to have a token

00:42:02
<transcript>: What is going on this web page makes me so sad for the future of the web or the present of the web. Maybe the future will be better. I don't know. Go over the menu on the left side of the screen and click bot. It's the icon that looks a little pizza.

00:42:04
<transcript>: Puzzle piece.

00:42:09
juniornascm: you have to start using a adblock soon

00:42:11
<transcript>: Lithium reminds frag of evanescence.

00:42:29
<transcript>: So much revenue, you have to create a bot in the app to have a token, you have to start using an ad boxing. Oh, yeah. This is why people say I should use ad block, isn't it? When I wander into the web and I'm like, this is the worst. Okay, so I gotta add a bot. Let's go to DISCOL scope here. There was a link somewhere in all this mess.

00:42:29
<transcript>: there it is

00:42:30
<transcript>: There it is.

00:42:30
<transcript>: oof

00:42:33
<transcript>: Oof, Watchbot.

00:42:42
okufa_f: u block origin is a pretty good extension

00:42:48
<transcript>: Okay. That public key is not sensitive, right. Well, I just. I just made it public. If it's not, I don't know. Here we go. Build a bot and a bot. Yes. Adding a bot gives user gives your app visible life and discord.

00:42:48
<transcript>: choose wisely

00:42:53
<transcript>: Choose wisely OOH oh, two factor oh, this is sensitive, fuzzy.

00:42:53
<transcript>: sensitive

00:42:54
<transcript>: Sensitive.

00:43:07
<transcript>: I used to use a pie hole, which I just love the name of that pie hole. Anybody ever use a pie hole, like on your whole network where it just blocks, like, ad servers wholesale. It's pretty awesome. I don't know why I stopped.

00:43:08
smilingbig: I want to try it out

00:43:14
<transcript>: I think I moved when we moved into our new house, I didn't add it to the new network.

00:43:22
<transcript>: You have to start using ublock. Origin is a pretty good extension. Okay, okay. A wild bot has appeared. Let me go and get the token before.

00:43:27
<transcript>: I get crazy here.

00:43:27
<transcript>: copy the

00:43:29
<transcript>: Copy the token.

00:43:30
juniornascm: good idea

00:43:33
<transcript>: Okay. Now you're need to add it to Secrets manager.

00:43:33
night_light90: Question : what is the best react/js book you ever read? I am asking because i started to learn it , tried to buy a book and implement it but too many to choose from i was confused, P.S: I finished learning Vanila JS , Thanks in advance adam

00:43:36
<transcript>: Edit.

00:43:38
<transcript>: Okay.

00:43:38
<transcript>: say that

00:43:39
<transcript>: Say that should be it.

00:43:39
<transcript>: now i should

00:43:42
<transcript>: Now I should be able to run.

00:43:42
<transcript>: the thing

00:43:43
<transcript>: The thing.

00:43:44
<transcript>: Let's make sure.

00:43:49
albertlithium: my name is a joke from an airline ask me to put my bag in the hold as the plane was very full. I have told them I was carrying gadgets with batteries.

00:43:50
<transcript>: Because that secret value needs to not be displayed.

00:43:50
<transcript>: okay now

00:43:52
<transcript>: Okay, now I can come off of fuzzy.

00:43:53
juniornascm: i made a bot when youtube took down the musics bots in discord

00:43:56
<transcript>: Fuzzy, fuzzy. And now we can do this again.

00:43:58
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:44:03
albertlithium: They told me to move everything without batteris on the hold. Which was only the bag that dayt

00:44:06
<transcript>: Question, what is the best React js book you ever read? I'm asking because I started to learn it. Tried to buy a book and implement it, but too many to choose from. I was confused.

00:44:07
<transcript>: ps i finished

00:44:11
<transcript>: Ps. I finished learning vanilla jess things in advance. So nightlight.

00:44:11
<transcript>: i've read

00:44:18
<transcript>: I've read a lot of technical books in my day. I have never read a book for frontend. Never once. I don't know what that says about me.

00:44:18
<transcript>: disallow

00:44:20
<transcript>: Disallowed. Intense.

00:44:25
joostschuur: ‘finished learning’ ;)

00:44:26
<transcript>: I do a lot of frontend work, have never read a book about it. And I would say for react.

00:44:26
<transcript>: i think

00:44:31
<transcript>: I think there's probably better resources. Okay, honest, honest opinion.

00:44:31
<transcript>: i don't

00:44:32
virtualtablefunction: Just do it, that's the answer to frontend

00:44:37
<transcript>: I don't think you need tutorials or anything anymore. I think chat, GPT.

00:44:37
<transcript>: especially

00:44:52
<transcript>: Especially with gpd four. I don't know. I'm just trying to get on the Hype. No, seriously, chat gpt is the best thing to teach you how to do something in programming. But the most important step is have something you want to build. If you have something you want to build and you want it to exist.

00:44:52
<transcript>: so a tool

00:45:02
<transcript>: So a tool that will help you around the house, that will help you with your kids, that will help you with whatever you need, something that would help your digital life. Okay, when you have that idea.

00:45:02
<transcript>: wanting that

00:45:08
okufa_f: i agree, chatgpt has essentially replaced stackoverflow for me

00:45:09
nzlaura: @AlbertLithium look up kent c dodds, great articles and he has a react course

00:45:22
<transcript>: Wanting that thing to exist will be the best possible way. I think for you to actually learn something new, like React. So you want to build some kind of web app that does something for you and you need to use React to build it. That's gonna be the impetus you need to push through and to get through all the problems you're gonna run in a lot of stuff where it's like, how do I do this? I don't even know what to search. So Chad GB.

00:45:22
<transcript>: gbt is really

00:45:27
<transcript>: Gbt is really great. I've been using it actually for this discord bot. I'll show you.

00:45:27
<transcript>: chad g

00:45:34
<transcript>: Chad gbt taught me how to do all kinds of stuff with lassie Beanstalk because it's a dumb old service I don't care about, but I need to use it.

00:45:34
<transcript>: i

00:45:34
virtualtablefunction: @okufa_f Technically, it is Stackoverflow lol

00:45:41
okufa_f: @VirtualTableFunction true

00:45:45
<transcript>: I just like, type my big dumb question because I don't really know what to ask, and it just gives me good answers. So I think it's a really great way to hold your hand. It's like having a tutor just right there with you oneonone.

00:46:00
<transcript>: Now we're gonna figure out why disallowed intents is a problem. Albert lithium. Welcome to Chat. My name is a joke from an airline. Ask me to put my bag and the hold is the plane was very full. I've told him I was getting gadgets with batteries. That's awesome.

00:46:06
virtualtablefunction: but yeah I agree, I can't even remember the last time I bothered with Stackoverflow

00:46:06
<transcript>: Junior I made a bot when YouTube took down the muscle music spot and discords. Oh, interesting.

00:46:06
<transcript>: telling

00:46:07
night_light90: thank you will try it

00:46:11
<transcript>: Telling to move everything without batteries on the hold which was the only bag.

00:46:11
<transcript>: or only the bag that

00:46:12
<transcript>: Or only the bag that day.

00:46:19
<transcript>: Finished learning. Oh, did I say finished? You never finish learning? Did I say that.

00:46:19
<transcript>: oh

00:46:22
virtualtablefunction: The community on there is shocking enough to make me not want to use it

00:46:26
<transcript>: Oh, they said they finished learning vanilla js? Yeah, you'll never finish learning Vanelle js, or anything in Tech because it's constantly moving.

00:46:31
nzlaura: @night_light90 * look up kent c dodds, great articles and he has a react course. lol @'d wrong person soz

00:46:46
<transcript>: But you'll figure that out in due time. First time chat. Welcome to Chat virtual table function. Just do it. That's the answer to front end. Yeah. I think I've just never put, like a lot of weight into how good my front end code is. I've always just thought, like front ends or throwaway it's like all the sophisticated things I do in the back end with my apis and like making them really cool. I feel like that I care a lot more.

00:46:46
<transcript>: about it

00:46:53
<transcript>: About it and how it's architected and all that. And then on the front end, I'm like, Whatever. I'm probably gonna delete it later, and I just throw stuff together.

00:46:57
mono_nz: you need to validate chatgpts answers for yourself though. its great, but you can't be sure its always true right. also hi, just tuned in :)

00:47:01
<transcript>: Chad dvd is essentially replaced. Back overflow for me. Yeah. I think it's really great for, like, I need to build something with.

00:47:01
<transcript>: technology and i

00:47:02
smilingbig: yeah I think that's right LUL

00:47:08
<transcript>: Technology and I have some questions that it can guide me through the process. I'll show you my chat gpt history for this project here.

00:47:11
<transcript>: Technically it is overflow.

00:47:14
<transcript>: Legally how that's all gonna say.

00:47:23
<transcript>: I agree. I can't even remember last time I bothered the stack overflow so that has to be affecting stack overflow. Is traffic right? If people say things like this now eventually.

00:47:23
<transcript>: it's sort of

00:47:28
<transcript>: It's sort of an existential threat. I feel like so the stack overflows of the world.

00:47:28
<transcript>: and surely

00:47:31
<transcript>: And surely they'll have something to say about that legally, because that's a huge business.

00:47:37
<transcript>: Thank you we'll try it good to know night, good luck and keep coming back with more questions.

00:47:37
<transcript>: the

00:47:41
<transcript>: The community on there is shocking enough to make me not want to use it.

00:47:41
<transcript>: go on

00:47:43
<transcript>: Go on stack overflow.

00:47:51
<transcript>: Look up Kit C. Dots. Yeah, he's got some great React resources if you do want like an actual course or like a guide.

00:47:53
juniornascm: i still use stack overflow, but now the problems are more specific, and most because legacy stuff

00:47:55
<transcript>: In that way, like a video course. Can't see dods. You can't go wrong.

00:48:08
<transcript>: Pedee. Huh? Thanks much for that follow. I'm sorry if I botched your name. I butcher a lot of names. Mono. Welcome to Chat. You need to validate chat gpt's answers for yourself, though. It's great, but you can't be sure it's always true. Yeah. No, that's absolutely true.

00:48:08
<transcript>: like a lot of things

00:48:23
<transcript>: Like, a lot of things I'm gonna show you. I'm gonna walk you through what I paste it in, like, questions I asked to chat gpt, and then what I got out. Sometimes it's out of date, and you have to tweak the code that actually puts into your editor, but it's pretty fast to work through, like, what they were behind on, you know.

00:48:23
<transcript>: it's been really

00:48:25
<transcript>: It's been really helpful.

00:48:25
<transcript>: i'll

00:48:33
<transcript>: I'll show you so use stack overflow, but now the problems are more specific and most because legacy stuff makes sense.

00:48:38
<transcript>: Okay, so disallowed. Intense. I'm guessing this means.

00:48:38
<transcript>: i'm guessing

00:48:42
<transcript>: I'm guessing this means okay. Is this gonna show my thing.

00:48:42
<transcript>: no

00:48:47
<transcript>: No, it doesn't show a soken I think this means I have to like, yeah, yeah. Here we go.

00:48:55
<transcript>: Gateway intents require approval. If your body is verified, your bot is not verified. You can toggle those intents below to access them so presence.

00:48:55
<transcript>: presence update

00:49:04
<transcript>: Presence Update once your bot reaches 100, more services will require verification approval. We're going to go and turn it on. We're gonna turn them all on server members. Yep. Need that Guild members? Yeah.

00:49:04
<transcript>: and then

00:49:12
<transcript>: And then required for your bot to receive message content and most messages. Once your bot reaches a hundred more service, I guess that's fine. I don't care.

00:49:12
<transcript>: ooh

00:49:14
<transcript>: Ooh, look at all this.

00:49:14
<transcript>: look at

00:49:20
<transcript>: Look at all this. Oh, I do need to add some. They need to be able to sign roles. So.

00:49:20
<transcript>: manage roles

00:49:21
fragaverage: Discord bot stuff is quite fun, written a couple myself with postgres backends

00:49:24
<transcript>: Manage roles. I feel like I might just say everything.

00:49:27
fragaverage: databases* you get what I meant

00:49:27
<transcript>: But that might be too high.

00:49:31
<transcript>: What's permission's? Integer.

00:49:40
<transcript>: Discord bot stuff is quite fun written a couple myself with postgres backends yeah forgive what did you.

00:49:40
<transcript>: use for

00:49:51
<transcript>: Use for hosting. I feel like there's got to be like a managed discord bot service. Like, I just want to drop some typescript into some managed service and be like, Run my bot, please. I'll pay you $5 a month.

00:49:51
<transcript>: there you go

00:49:54
<transcript>: There you go. Business idea. Who wants to build it.

00:50:01
<transcript>: I'm just gonna go with manage roles and hope that that's enough. We're about to find out. Manage messages. I don't see anything else.

00:50:01
<transcript>: i'm

00:50:08
<transcript>: I'm only. I'm only assigning rules to people. I'm doing nothing else with them. As long as that's enough. Okay, save changes.

00:50:13
fragaverage: Heroku, 7$ plan, supabase for a free postgres db

00:50:13
juniornascm: This permission integer is becuase they use a or gate and bit operations to figure out all the permissions you have

00:50:18
<transcript>: Oh, this is how you calculate the permissions integer for your bot based on the feature it needs. So then what do I do with this permissions integer? I don't know.

00:50:18
<transcript>: who knows

00:50:20
<transcript>: Who knows? Do I need to do something with that.

00:50:26
<transcript>: So I don't give the bot permission here. It's like I do it on the client side. That doesn't seem right.

00:50:30
cowfacedude99: got sprung out on an interview and the interview asked me 'what do you know about typescipt', I told him, I just use it, I don't remember the types and stuff. can't say it went well LUL

00:50:32
<transcript>: Let's just let's give it a go now let's try it.

00:50:37
<transcript>: 404.

00:50:41
<transcript>: Unknown Guild. So my Guild ID was wrong.

00:50:44
<transcript>: I got the gild ID wrong.

00:50:49
<transcript>: Okay.

00:50:53
smilingbig: maybe they have some more niche security because discord gets 'hacked' a lot?

00:50:56
<transcript>: Let's let's see. Do I have to add it? Do I have to add the bot to my server.

00:50:56
<transcript>: amen now

00:50:58
<transcript>: Amen now.

00:50:58
<transcript>: am i

00:50:59
<transcript>: Am I.

00:50:59
<transcript>: discord

00:51:05
<transcript>: Discord busted database is heroku seven hour plan Superbased for a free postgres database.

00:51:05
<transcript>: so my

00:51:12
fragaverage: Yes, you need to generate an invite link

00:51:12
<transcript>: So my bot is so done it doesn't even need a database, but $7 on heroku. I guess that's maybe that's better than elastic beansock.

00:51:12
<transcript>: it's

00:51:13
<transcript>: It's.

00:51:13
<transcript>: i just know how

00:51:16
<transcript>: I just know how to use a bit, so I always want to use it.

00:51:20
<transcript>: This permission integer is because they use.

00:51:25
<transcript>: A or gate and bid operations. Figure out all the permissions you have. Okay.

00:51:25
<transcript>: but where do i

00:51:28
<transcript>: But where do I use the permissions integer.

00:51:28
<transcript>: like

00:51:30
<transcript>: Like, where would I set? That.

00:51:34
<transcript>: I don't see anywhere to set it.

00:51:46
<transcript>: Calf faces here got sprung out on an inner view. In the interview asked me, what do you know about typescript? I told him, I just use it. I don't remember what types of stuff can't say. It went well.

00:51:53
fragaverage: Heroku makes life simple for an AWS noob like me because I just link a GitHub repo to it, any push to a particular branch gets released

00:51:59
<transcript>: No, you're so right, though. Cafes, nobody knows Taiwan. I had this joke I was gonna do in one of my little teaser videos. Like about how developers like lots of different developers identify in different ways. Some of us identify.

00:51:59
<transcript>: with like

00:52:06
<transcript>: With like our job titles like Software Engineer or I'm a software developer or whatever.

00:52:15
<transcript>: The staff engineer, like some of us do that. Some of us identify what the languages we use. Like a ruby developer. They write ruby, python developers. They write pipes.

00:52:15
<transcript>: javascript

00:52:22
<transcript>: Javascript developers write typescript, but we don't call ourselves Hype script developers because no one actually understands typescript.

00:52:38
fragaverage: https://discordapi.com/permissions.html#8

00:52:42
gigo6000: morning

00:52:43
<transcript>: That joke. I was gonna use that, but I didn't. I just used it right here. How did it go? What was the reception on that joke? I don't get to hear the audience, so I don't know if it's dead quiet right now. It is dead quiet. I don't know if you're chuckling, if it got a smile, a little smirk, anything like that. Anybody? No. Okay. Maybe they have some more niche.

00:52:43
<transcript>: security because

00:52:44
tayloreddev: tumbleweed

00:52:46
bezyy_3y: :)

00:52:46
gigo6000: true facts

00:52:49
mono_nz: PogChamp

00:52:50
<transcript>: Security, because this cord gets hacked a lot. You need to generate an invite link. Okay, so I'm going to invite the bot into our guild, and then it's going to work.

00:52:50
<transcript>: herok

00:52:51
smilingbig: :-)

00:53:00
<transcript>: Heroku heroku makes life simple for an AWS new like me because I just link a GitHub repo to it and push any or any push to a particular branch gets released that makes sense.

00:53:03
<transcript>: That makes sense. Gigo Good morning.

00:53:03
<transcript>: tumbley

00:53:04
<transcript>: Tumbley.

00:53:06
<transcript>: Ouch.

00:53:06
<transcript>: ouch

00:53:09
<transcript>: Ouch, ouch. Oh, look, some smirks. Thank you guys.

00:53:12
<transcript>: Thank you for your smirks.

00:53:12
<transcript>: i appreciate it

00:53:16
<transcript>: I appreciate it. Okay. How do I bring so I need to generate an invite link.

00:53:19
<transcript>: Generate invite link.

00:53:23
<transcript>: Can I just, like, search for it and find it.

00:53:23
<transcript>: i

00:53:30
<transcript>: I guess that's why you said Generate an invite. Let's see. Oh, you can divide up to 50 discord users to test your application.

00:53:34
<transcript>: They must have a registered email and a positive attitude. That's some good copy.

00:53:34
<transcript>: so

00:53:35
fragaverage: https://discordapi.com/permissions.html#8

00:53:36
fragaverage: https://discordapi.com/permissions.html#8

00:53:36
<transcript>: So I have to do it like this.

00:53:36
<transcript>: i have to invite

00:53:40
fragaverage: 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️

00:53:41
<transcript>: I have to invite a user. I want to add it to my search, though. Oh.

00:53:45
<transcript>: Fresh frag is trying so hard to get me to pay attention.

00:53:48
<transcript>: Let's see. Let me copy that. And open it.

00:53:52
mono_nz: not too big on aws (use it at work), but my favourite product is cloud run on google cloud. so nice

00:53:55
<transcript>: Frag. Why you spamming me with that link? Oh, it's the answer to all my questions. Got it.

00:54:01
<transcript>: Okay, so administrator. Well, that's a little heavyhanded. We just want to manage roles.

00:54:01
<transcript>: and now you're saying

00:54:14
<transcript>: And now you're saying I can let's see oauth URL generator. Oh, oh, okay. So interclind ID require code group grant. Oh, all of this is so confusing. Is my scope bot.

00:54:20
<transcript>: Okay, I need to insert the client ID, which is in my discord bot.

00:54:20
<transcript>: no

00:54:22
<transcript>: No, it's in my app.

00:54:22
<transcript>: application

00:54:25
<transcript>: Application ID.

00:54:25
<transcript>: i'm so confused

00:54:26
<transcript>: I'm so confused.

00:54:26
<transcript>: what is the

00:54:28
<transcript>: What is the client ID.

00:54:33
<transcript>: Help frag hail help me, I'm poor.

00:54:34
fragaverage: Yes bot is default on there anyway. clientID = app ID

00:54:36
juniornascm: its YOUR client id

00:54:41
<transcript>: Mono not too big on AWS use it at work, but my favorite product is cloud Run. I'm going on Google cloud so nice. I've heard good things.

00:54:46
<transcript>: Bot is default on there anyway client ID is appid. Thank you so much frag.

00:54:46
<transcript>: for knowing

00:54:53
<transcript>: For knowing things about things that I'm working on? Do I need code grant? Do I need a code grant.

00:54:55
<transcript>: It's your client ID.

00:54:58
<transcript>: My Client ID.

00:55:01
juniornascm: i think

00:55:02
<transcript>: Do I need.

00:55:02
<transcript>: to require

00:55:04
<transcript>: To require code grant.

00:55:09
<transcript>: You think so? Let's try it. Response type code. I don't actually think I do.

00:55:09
fragaverage: Nope, no code grant

00:55:11
fragaverage: just the app id

00:55:14
<transcript>: Well, I don't actually know one of my talking about no code Grant. Okay.

00:55:14
<transcript>: just the app

00:55:18
<transcript>: Just the app ID. Here we go. So I just click the link. Here we go.

00:55:18
<transcript>: we're gonna add

00:55:20
<transcript>: We're gonna add it.

00:55:20
<transcript>: to the

00:55:24
<transcript>: To the Watch dev server. Here we go.

00:55:33
<transcript>: Once access to your discord account, manage rolls. Yep, this is perfect. This is perfect. Except I need to go fuzzy because you guys are gonna try and steal my offcode.

00:55:33
<transcript>: i see you

00:55:35
<transcript>: I see you.

00:55:35
<transcript>: see you guys

00:55:36
<transcript>: See you guys.

00:55:41
<transcript>: Sneaking up on my offcode? Did I actually go fuzzy? Oh, geez, yeah. Okay.

00:55:41
<transcript>: i don't know what

00:55:45
<transcript>: I don't know what you would actually do if you have the auth code like.

00:55:45
<transcript>: could you actually

00:55:46
juniornascm: i was mistaken, i'm sorry

00:55:47
<transcript>: Could you actually do anything.

00:55:50
<transcript>: Okay authorize, you may close this.

00:55:50
<transcript>: oh you're

00:55:52
<transcript>: Oh, You're Fine Jr.

00:55:52
<transcript>: you were

00:55:58
laytanl_: Hey Adam!

00:55:59
<transcript>: You were less wrong than I was or less mistaken than I was. Okay. I guess it's been added now, I guess.

00:55:59
<transcript>: i guess

00:56:03
<transcript>: I guess so guess we're good. So now what.

00:56:03
<transcript>: now

00:56:05
<transcript>: Now.

00:56:05
<transcript>: laten

00:56:06
<transcript>: Latency.

00:56:06
<transcript>: we're making

00:56:14
<transcript>: We're making a discord bot a very random, very quickly project that I need to get done very quickly and move on because I got other stuff to do.

00:56:14
<transcript>: got so much

00:56:17
laytanl_: Ohh cool

00:56:23
fragaverage: Bot has now joined the discord

00:56:27
<transcript>: Got so much to do, but this thing now should be added to my guild. So now I'm gonna do this, and it's just gonna work. I'm gonna be so happy about it. Nope. Didn't work. Invalid formbody subscriber is not Snowflake.

00:56:27
<transcript>: i'm sorry

00:56:29
<transcript>: I'm sorry.

00:56:31
laytanl_: What's it gonna do?

00:56:35
<transcript>: Kind of an error is that value. Subscriber is not Snowflake.

00:56:39
<transcript>: It's supposed to be Snowflake.

00:56:41
<transcript>: What.

00:56:47
<transcript>: Can I only what.

00:56:48
laytanl_: Snowflake is a uuid format

00:56:49
<transcript>: I'm sorry.

00:56:53
<transcript>: So discord.

00:56:58
smilingbig: ^

00:56:59
<transcript>: How he was not snowflake. What are you talking about.

00:57:03
<transcript>: Snowflake is a UID format Oh.

00:57:08
<transcript>: Thanks, laden. You just hopped in and you had answers. I appreciate that.

00:57:08
<transcript>: bo

00:57:16
<transcript>: Bon has now joined the discord. Oh, what's it gonna do? It's just gonna manage some roles for us. Some dynamic roles based on we're just doing some weird stuff.

00:57:16
<transcript>: that's

00:57:18
<transcript>: That's a little off the beaten path.

00:57:23
<transcript>: And I need to be able to manage the role with some typescript.

00:57:23
<transcript>: i'll show you

00:57:25
<transcript>: I'll show you once it's done.

00:57:25
<transcript>: we're just we're gonna

00:57:28
<transcript>: We're just we're gonna get this running here very shortly.

00:57:34
<transcript>: So the redirect I'm using six was to disable Oops to code grant under the bot tab and the diffware.

00:57:34
<transcript>: so

00:57:39
<transcript>: So I'm supposed to submit the role as an ID.

00:57:41
<transcript>: I gotcha.

00:57:41
<transcript>: it's got

00:57:44
<transcript>: It's got to be an ID, not the name.

00:57:44
<transcript>: but

00:57:46
<transcript>: But the ID.

00:57:46
<transcript>: that

00:57:48
<transcript>: That makes sense.

00:57:48
<transcript>: okay

00:57:50
<transcript>: Okay. So I can fix that.

00:57:50
<transcript>: let's see

00:57:51
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:57:54
<transcript>: So here.

00:57:54
<transcript>: name starts

00:57:58
<transcript>: Name starts with, but when I do remove and I do add.

00:57:58
<transcript>: well

00:58:00
<transcript>: Well, when I say.

00:58:02
<transcript>: If that.

00:58:02
<transcript>: then add the

00:58:04
<transcript>: Then add the roll.

00:58:08
<transcript>: Okay. I'm gonna go fuzzy real quick, because I'm gonna pull up discord.

00:58:14
<transcript>: Everyone, welcome, watchbox.

00:58:14
<transcript>: it's

00:58:16
<transcript>: It's the watch spot. Everybody.

00:58:19
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:58:30
<transcript>: I'm trying to find the rolls? I'm gonna go to servers, settings? I'm gonna go to rolls and I'm gonna go to the.

00:58:30
<transcript>: subscriber

00:58:32
<transcript>: Subscriber roll.

00:58:37
<transcript>: And I'm gonna get the ID. Copy. Id. There it is. There it is.

00:58:37
<transcript>: okay

00:58:38
laytanl_: Title still says you are rewriting statmuse btw

00:58:38
<transcript>: Okay.

00:58:42
<transcript>: And this isn't a sensitive thing. I'm just gonna paste it up here at the top.

00:58:47
<transcript>: Subscriber. Subscriber. Roll ID.

00:58:53
<transcript>: I didn't ask him to be callable. I'm sorry.

00:59:01
<transcript>: Here we go. Subscriber Role ID. So now it's the name starts with subscriber. We want to add.

00:59:09
<transcript>: This subscriber role ID. Okay. And if it has subscriber.

00:59:09
<transcript>: i don't know if

00:59:12
<transcript>: I don't know if the cache is gonna be based on the name.

00:59:12
<transcript>: or if it

00:59:18
<transcript>: Or if it's gonna be I don't know if that's the names or the ids. It's probably the ids. Actually.

00:59:21
<transcript>: Name starts with.

00:59:21
<transcript>: so we're

00:59:28
<transcript>: So we're gonna do on this one. We're gonna do also subscriber role ID and then remove.

00:59:28
<transcript>: subs

00:59:31
<transcript>: Subscriber roll ID. Okay.

00:59:34
cowfacedude99: !today

00:59:34
fossabot: Today Adam is working on statmuse.com, a website for sports nerds.

00:59:35
<transcript>: Is that it? Now go down here.

00:59:37
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:59:37
<transcript>: that's it

00:59:39
<transcript>: That's it.

00:59:39
<transcript>: that's it

00:59:48
<transcript>: That's it. Sorry, cow face. This is not what we're doing today. We're working on Statmes. It's just a little detour. Just a little tiny detour. This is just a fast thing I want to do. Okay.

00:59:48
<transcript>: it's just

00:59:50
<transcript>: It's just gonna take a second.

00:59:55
<transcript>: Same sort. Just gonna take a second, and then we're back to samus. Okay.

00:59:55
<transcript>: that's all

00:59:58
<transcript>: That's all. Just a little quick thing.

00:59:58
<transcript>: did it work

00:59:58
cowfacedude99: is it LUL

01:00:01
<transcript>: Did it work? Missing permissions.

01:00:01
<transcript>: so i wasn't able to

01:00:02
<transcript>: So I wasn't able to.

01:00:04
<transcript>: Missing permission.

01:00:09
<transcript>: There are 463 members in the server.

01:00:12
<transcript>: Logged in as Watchbot.

01:00:17
<transcript>: Code and data code? What.

01:00:20
<transcript>: Missing permissions.

01:00:27
<transcript>: Thought I had permissions. I'm trying to do what I'm trying to add and remove roles.

01:00:27
<transcript>: is

01:00:30
<transcript>: Is it is it cafe.

01:00:37
<transcript>: It is it's just a little quick thing. But what am I missing? Permissions for? I've almost got this code work.

01:00:40
<transcript>: We're trying to get roles.

01:00:50
tayloreddev: a few hours later.... LUL

01:00:54
<transcript>: I guess we're trying to more than just give rolls. We're trying to fetch all the members, which we did successfully because it got the member size right. And then we tried to go, oh, members, each is it each.

01:01:01
<transcript>: Oh it's identical to for each but returns the collection instead of undefined oh interesting.

01:01:12
<transcript>: So for each member, we're doing update member roles, and then we're trying to listen to guild member update. Do I need to I need to do something to make it where it can listen.

01:01:19
<transcript>: Let's see, let's see if it added anybody's roles. No, no. Rolls. Added.

01:01:20
cowfacedude99: more like 'A few stream later....'

01:01:21
<transcript>: I don't think.

01:01:28
<transcript>: Let's see, let's look at somebody's. Rolls. Here. Cafes.

01:01:33
<transcript>: Rolls. No, it didn't add the subscriber roll. Okay, okay.

01:01:37
<transcript>: So I don't think.

01:01:39
<transcript>: A few streams later.

01:01:44
<transcript>: Stop it, guys. Taylor's giving me the benefit of doubt. A few hours later.

01:01:45
<transcript>: Cafe says Nope.

01:01:45
<transcript>: that would be

01:01:48
<transcript>: That would be way too fast.

01:01:56
<transcript>: So there's something wrong with my with my permission. I should just give it an administrator. Shouldn't I? I should just give it administrator.

01:02:01
<transcript>: I'm sorry. I need that link again. Where was that? Frag.

01:02:03
<transcript>: This one.

01:02:07
<transcript>: I need this one again. Cuz. I got to do this all over again.

01:02:07
<transcript>: client i

01:02:09
<transcript>: Client I. D.

01:02:14
<transcript>: Is this thing copy. I'm just gonna give it administrator.

01:02:14
<transcript>: forget about it

01:02:15
<transcript>: Forget about it.

01:02:19
<transcript>: Administrators and then also manage roles just because why not.

01:02:23
<transcript>: I don't know what I would be missing, but we're gonna just do that.

01:02:25
<transcript>: Hit this.

01:02:28
<transcript>: And hit this.

01:02:31
<transcript>: Create commands. Okay.

01:02:31
<transcript>: administrator

01:02:34
<transcript>: Administrator. Here we go. Gotta do this again.

01:02:34
<transcript>: fuzzy

01:02:36
<transcript>: Fuzzy.

01:02:41
<transcript>: We're making progress. What are we, an hour. End our in the stream. All right.

01:02:43
fragaverage: Did you give it the server members intent?

01:02:52
<transcript>: Did you give it the server members intent? I don't know. I'm giving an administrator now we're going heavyhanded.

01:02:52
<transcript>: he

01:02:54
<transcript>: Heavyhanded.

01:02:54
<transcript>: thanks for watching

01:02:58
<transcript>: Thanks for watching. Follow Acid Acid sack.

01:03:00
<transcript>: That's funny.

01:03:00
<transcript>: when we drive

01:03:01
<transcript>: When we drive.

01:03:01
<transcript>: okay

01:03:05
fragaverage: On the dev portal, you still need to give it server members intent I think

01:03:06
<transcript>: Okay, I can close that now. When we drive to Kansas City from springfield, Riley.

01:03:08
<transcript>: What am I doing.

01:03:08
<transcript>: this okay

01:03:16
<transcript>: This. Okay. I should just work now. When we drive to Ken City, we drive over a little Creek that's called north dre. Sack thought that was funny.

01:03:16
<transcript>: trice

01:03:18
<transcript>: Tricec.

01:03:18
<transcript>: missing permiss

01:03:20
<transcript>: Missing permissions? Still missing permissions.

01:03:27
devd0: ayoo

01:03:31
cowfacedude99: there goes 'Principle of least privilage' LUL

01:03:34
<transcript>: I apologize to my mom for that joke. If you're here, mom, the driver thing not in the best taste. I apologize.

01:03:35
devd0: did we fix the neovim config @adamdotdev ?

01:03:38
<transcript>: There goes principle of least privilege. Yeah, we just jump straight to administrator.

01:03:46
juniornascm: try to give permission in the server

01:03:47
okufa_f: is your cofounder an avid sports fan?

01:03:51
<transcript>: Did we fix the Neovis config? We did devd. We did. Now I have full titan stuff in my astrophiles. It's amazing. And apparently everyone's always had this. But I was the only one that had broken lsp stuff.

01:03:57
<transcript>: Try to give permission in the server, try to give permission in the server.

01:03:57
<transcript>: what do you mean

01:04:03
<transcript>: What do you mean? Like in here? Find the watch Dev thing. Let's see.

01:04:03
<transcript>: find

01:04:07
<transcript>: Find the Watchbot and give it permissions. Here.

01:04:09
<transcript>: Roll moderator.

01:04:13
<transcript>: Moderator maybe.

01:04:13
<transcript>: oh

01:04:15
<transcript>: Oh, wait, wait.

01:04:15
<transcript>: it needs to

01:04:17
juniornascm: see if the bot can manage roles

01:04:17
<transcript>: It needs to have a roll.

01:04:17
<transcript>: okay

01:04:26
fragaverage: It has a special role which is full admin

01:04:32
mono_nz: all i can see now is zoolander "its in the computer"

01:04:37
<transcript>: Okay, let's. It does have a role. Let's do this. Let's do this. I know what to do. I know what to do. People. I actually know something about something. We gotta move this role up. Somehow. The order matters on these things. I remember reading for the stream cord bot that you had to have it above the role you want to manage. So watch this. Watch.

01:04:39
<transcript>: This.

01:04:39
<transcript>: thanks for

01:04:41
<transcript>: Thanks for Chef. Follow Allison.

01:04:44
juniornascm: yeah

01:04:45
<transcript>: Has a special role, full admin.

01:04:45
<transcript>: okay let's see if this works

01:04:47
<transcript>: Okay. Let's see if this works. Now.

01:04:52
<transcript>: Guys.

01:04:55
<transcript>: It's working.

01:04:59
<transcript>: A kufa is My co founder and avid sports fan.

01:05:01
<transcript>: Yes.

01:05:01
<transcript>: well i wouldn't

01:05:03
tayloreddev: ship it

01:05:06
fragaverage: Send it

01:05:07
<transcript>: Well, I wouldn't say avid. We both were more avid sports fans when we started Statmes. Then we are now.

01:05:07
<transcript>: today

01:05:10
<transcript>: Today we are less so than we used to be.

01:05:10
<transcript>: okay

01:05:12
mono_nz: :shipit:

01:05:18
juniornascm: ship it

01:05:18
<transcript>: Okay, try to give permission to server. Okay, so I'd probably didn't need to give it admin. Oh, look at this. Look at this. It's working. Do you see this.

01:05:18
<transcript>: hahaha

01:05:20
<transcript>: Hahaha.

01:05:24
devd0: How many employees does statemuse have?

01:05:24
<transcript>: See these Subscriber Rolls. This is a Special role.

01:05:24
<transcript>: it's a special

01:05:27
<transcript>: It's a special role, that.

01:05:27
<transcript>: you get

01:05:32
devd0: Did you guys raise funding?

01:05:47
<transcript>: You get assigned if you subscribe to any one of the streamers. So if you subscribe to Me or dax or any one of the dozens of dead streamers we're gonna add to this server, then just subscribing to one of them gives you this special watch subscriber role. Okay, that's what this whole bot does, because there's not really a way to do that. To say, like if you have any one.

<transcript>: of these

01:06:05
<transcript>: Of these other roles, I'm gonna sign this role to you. Just not a way to do that natively in discord. So we had to write this stupid little bot. And if you change your roles, so let's say I say, let's see here. Let's find somebody. Let's say who's here? Who's here? That's on discord. That is not a subscriber that I can shame.

01:11:10

01:11:22

01:12:32
cowfacedude99: when you first started....

01:12:34
<transcript>: We do need to build the bot every time we deploy, but I'll just put that in like a script.

<transcript>: Watchbot.

01:12:38
<transcript>: application

01:12:39

01:12:45
<transcript>: I asked.

01:12:45
<transcript>: i'll just show

01:12:56
<transcript>: I'll just show you this. I'm trying not to go too slow here because we got a lot to do. But this is how like I literally just asked. I started this conversation with Chat gbt. This is gpt Four, I said.

01:12:56
<transcript>: how

01:12:57
21givenchy: a platform for professionals to get latest insights and network

01:13:07
<transcript>: How can I write a discord app with typescript that listens to events when my any user in my server has a role change and it just gave me all this gold. Look at this gold. It wrote my whole project.

01:13:07
<transcript>: it gave me this

01:13:08
<transcript>: It gave me this.

01:13:08
<transcript>: and

01:13:10
<transcript>: And like this.

01:13:10
<transcript>: for like getting

01:13:16
<transcript>: For, like, getting the Rolls and doing all this. And it all works. And I'm so impressed. And then I was like, Oh.

01:13:16
<transcript>: i

01:13:24
<transcript>: I need to listen. I know web hooks, because I don't I want to do this serverlessly. I don't want to have some server running, and they're like, yeah, you can use discord web hooks.

01:13:35
<transcript>: But this core web looks have some limitations. They don't have event for role changes, so useless to me. Assuming chi gpc is correct, which I assume it is.

01:13:35
<transcript>: so

01:13:48
<transcript>: So I had to bail on that. And then I started asking it, how can I do this with elastic Beansock? It wrote some cdk for me. Just amazing. It's incredible. Like then I had specific things that I need to do with the cdk. Right? So, like, here.

01:13:48
<transcript>: which

01:13:52
<transcript>: Which elastic Beansock Solution stack name should I use for node 16 because it was the defaulting.

01:13:52
<transcript>: which is

01:14:07
<transcript>: Which is not good. I want to know 16, and then it's like, oh, well, I don't know because there's my knowledge cutoff, but it led me down the path that I got the right answer. Then I said, how do I add a roll to a member using a discord jazz library? Oh, here's how you do that, because I'm Super healthy.

01:14:07
<transcript>: it's just amazing

01:14:12
<transcript>: It's just amazing. Thanks so much for the follow alpaz Al PASLEY.

01:14:23
<transcript>: Then I said, how do I set environment variables for elastic beanstalk? Environment created in the cdk once again gave me all this obscure stuff, which I would have never figured out. I would have dug in the docs forever.

01:14:23
<transcript>: and i

01:14:42
<transcript>: And I didn't have to. It's just right here. And I was like, how do I do that with a secret value? I think, oh, no. How do I set instance size and turn off the load balancer? Because I want a load balancer. I just want a single tt to micro. And here we are. Single T two micro, just like that. Although I think I should probably use T three micro. Is there a T four now.

01:14:45
<transcript>: Key for it on micro.

01:14:48
<transcript>: Aws EC two instance.

01:14:48

01:15:06

<transcript>: Nano. I might even want to Nano.

01:15:32
<transcript>: it

01:15:39

01:16:12
<transcript>: I'm actually surprised it has the right code for discord js. I thought the newest version of that was Post 21. Yeah. M huggins. I had to tweak some stuff.

01:16:12
<transcript>: i did

01:16:24
<transcript>: I did actually have to tweak some things with the role management stuff, but it was really easy to do because like, typescript, just like, got me there. You know what I mean? It's like it gets you close enough and then typescript gets you the rest of the way.

01:16:29
<transcript>: All right, let's try this.

01:16:32
<transcript>: Try to pulling it.

01:16:32

01:18:04

01:18:12

01:18:15
<transcript>: Let's try, let's delete this.

01:18:15
<transcript>: and then let's

01:18:18

01:18:45
<transcript>: Can I find asset? Enter what.

01:18:49
<transcript>: Oh, it did not build. Okay, so it didn't build.

<transcript>: someone tell me

01:19:39
devd0: I usually just buy the potato kind from my local grocery

01:19:41
<transcript>: Someone tell me I don't know the answer oh chechy btgbd.

01:19:41
<transcript>: let's see

01:19:42
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:19:43
devd0: highly recommend

01:19:44
<transcript>: Chat dpt.

01:19:46
<transcript>: How can I.

01:19:49
<transcript>: How.

01:19:49
<transcript>: can

01:19:51
<transcript>: Can I write.

01:19:51
<transcript>: a build

01:19:53
<transcript>: A build script.

01:19:53
<transcript>: in package

01:19:58
<transcript>: In package dot json that builds.

01:19:58
<transcript>: a

01:19:59
<transcript>: A.

01:20:03
<transcript>: Child package.

01:20:06
<transcript>: Before.

01:20:08
laytanl_: You can just cd, what you have should work

01:20:08
<transcript>: Building.

01:20:08
<transcript>: at

01:20:10
<transcript>: At the root.

01:20:15
<transcript>: Cd what you have should work. Okay.

01:20:18
<transcript>: Now I'm just curious what it says.

01:20:18
<transcript>: it's not that

01:20:21
<transcript>: It's not that I don't trust you latent.

01:20:21
<transcript>: oh prescript

01:20:25
<transcript>: Oh, prescripts. No, pmpm doesn't do that. It doesn't do the prescript thing.

01:20:36
<transcript>: It doesn't do that. Okay. We'll look at this later. So you're saying this should be fine? I just need to. I need to back back out. Then.

01:20:39
<transcript>: I need to do CD.

01:20:43
<transcript>: Like that.

01:20:47
<transcript>: And ssc Bill geez, that's a lot.

01:20:47
<transcript>: let's try

01:20:49
<transcript>: Let's try it.

01:20:54
<transcript>: Okay. It's doing the bot build. That's good.

01:20:57
<transcript>: Did it do it.

01:21:00
<transcript>: Built one stack to ssc disks. Oh, Wow.

01:21:00
<transcript>: it worked

01:21:01
<transcript>: It worked.

01:21:01
<transcript>: built

01:21:04
<transcript>: Built this first. And then. Yeah, okay.

01:21:08
<transcript>: Kind of a mess of a script, but.

01:21:10
<transcript>: What worked.

01:21:14
<transcript>: Okay. Now I'm gonna do.

01:21:14
<transcript>: excuse

01:21:15
<transcript>: Excuse me.

01:21:15
<transcript>: yank in here

01:21:18
<transcript>: Yank in here and then.

01:21:25
<transcript>: Instead of build that's gonna be deployed.

01:21:27
<transcript>: Okay.

01:21:27
<transcript>: let's get key

01:21:31
<transcript>: Let's get keycaster going I'm sorry I've not been key casting.

01:21:44
<transcript>: Ssd looks great. Want to have an server for my subscribers with aws and use Next. Yeah, sst is fantastic. If you're doing full stack and you want to do anything on aws, ssd is the only answer.

01:21:44
<transcript>: i usually just

01:21:50
<transcript>: I usually just buy the potato kind for my local grocery. Highly recommended. What kind of what kind of question was that.

01:21:50
<transcript>: where was that

01:21:51
thdxr: I always join at the perfect time

01:21:54
<transcript>: Where was that dev? Where is the context I'm missing for.

01:21:54
<transcript>: the potato

01:21:56
<transcript>: The potato kind.

01:21:58
thdxr: when someone is asking about sst

01:21:58
<transcript>: What are we talking about.

01:22:01
<transcript>: I always joins the perfect time to actually hurt.

01:22:01
<transcript>: you just

01:22:04
<transcript>: You just jumped in and I was shilling SSC.

01:22:10
devd0: you where talking about chips

01:22:14
devd0: lmao

01:22:15
<transcript>: It's that question every day. Okay, so, hey, dax, I'm just building a little quick thing for our watch Debt dev server. It's kind of awesome, but it uses elastic beads. Sock. I'm sorry.

01:22:19
anonymous_691: should i buy an escort

01:22:20
<transcript>: Ssc with elastic beanstalk. Have you ever seen that combination? Next I wonder, I wonder.

01:22:23
thdxr: wtf why

01:22:24
<transcript>: Kim, PM deploy.

01:22:29
<transcript>: Nope. Nope. No project was selected for deployment. I always forget what I have to do here, pmpm. Deploy.

01:22:31
<transcript>: But I have to stop.

01:22:32
thdxr: is it because it needs a ws client?

01:22:39
<transcript>: It axe.

01:22:51
<transcript>: Yeah, it has to be connected to a websocket. It sucks. Is there a way to do that? Dax? It has to connect to discord and have a persistent websocket connection to get events there's. The web hook approach doesn't work with this chord because they don't give you role change updates.

01:22:51
<transcript>: that's

01:22:53
<transcript>: That's the long and the short of it.

01:23:06
<transcript>: And if you want to tell me to do, like, Fly io or something, that's fine. Just tell me if I should run this on something other than EC Two. That's fine. But it's really the dumbest little service ever that I'm not worried about. It's gonna restart itself every day, like I'm just not worried about it.

01:23:06
<transcript>: i've already written

01:23:08
thdxr: I was wondering if someone had built a serverless service for this but never looked

01:23:10
<transcript>: I've already written all the cdk for it because Chat gpt is awesome.

01:23:10
<transcript>: i was wondering

01:23:11
thdxr: yeah it's fine

01:23:22
<transcript>: I was wondering if someone who built a serverless surface but never looked. Me too. I thought there should just be discord bot hosting. I want to write some typescript, and then I want to host my discord bot. That should just be a thing. Okay, it's fine, but how do I deploy.

01:23:30
<transcript>: It says no project was selected for deployment. I don't know what that means.

01:23:32
<transcript>: I do use ssc, I promise.

01:23:32
<transcript>: i just forget

01:23:34
<transcript>: I just forget what this means.

01:23:34
<transcript>: i'm

01:23:37
<transcript>: I'm supposed to do something like deploy.

01:23:40
thdxr: or even more generally just a ws client as a service that stays connected and emits events somewhere

01:23:41
<transcript>: Project.

01:23:43
<transcript>: Or something.

01:23:49
<transcript>: Even more generally, just a website as a service that says connected in the midst of it somewhere, that would be awesome. Dax.

01:23:49
<transcript>: that

01:23:50
foobfoob: pnpm run deploy?

01:23:53
<transcript>: That sounds even more awesome and more broadly applicable.

01:23:56
<transcript>: Run deploy. Is that what I have to do.

01:23:59
<transcript>: Oh, sure enough.

01:24:05
<transcript>: Why I thought with pmpn. There's like yarn. You don't have to say run.

01:24:05
<transcript>: deploys

01:24:06
<transcript>: Deploys special.

01:24:13
<transcript>: Interesting.

01:24:13
foobfoob: was just a guess, never used pnpm :D

01:24:15
<transcript>: We're gonna have to test this again.

01:24:21
<transcript>: That was a great guest. Food. Poop. Good work. Thank you so much.

01:24:26
<transcript>: Didn't need the ss T Xvert to tell me answer.

01:24:37
thdxr: never used elastic beanstalk how does it work, is it a docker container?

01:24:37
<transcript>: Okay. After this deploy is, we're getting back to Satinis as long as this runs. Okay. On macy two instance, it gets a secret value and all that stuff. We'll test it. We have a way to quickly test it.

01:24:40
<transcript>: Just have to give the sub.

01:24:40
<transcript>: never use elast

01:24:44
<transcript>: Never use elastic beanstalk. How does it work? Is it a docker container.

01:24:44
<transcript>: it is not

01:24:45
foobfoob: it can be a container

01:24:52
fragaverage: Give the bot a high up role so we can see it online :D

01:24:57
<transcript>: It is not a docker container. It's just an easy two instance decks. It's really elastic. Beanstalk is just like a wrapper around cloudformation. It's just like some pre baked cloudformation templates for certain. Runtimes. It's like you want to build a node app and deploy it to EC two.

01:24:57
<transcript>: use a lassa

01:25:00
<transcript>: Use a lassa bean stock. It kind of sucks, but.

01:25:02
cowfacedude99: Not exactly..

01:25:04
thdxr: ah

01:25:05
<transcript>: Oh, we can't be a container. I didn't know that. Thanks, food. Give the bike.

01:25:05
<transcript>: a high up

01:25:08
<transcript>: A high up roll so we can see it online.

01:25:12
<transcript>: You want to see the bot on line? I kind of like it hidden.

01:25:14
thdxr: we have containers on our roadmap

01:25:15
<transcript>: Kind of like it not visible.

01:25:20
<transcript>: You have containers on your roadmap, back.

01:25:23
foobfoob: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_docker.html

01:25:24
cowfacedude99: I can remove my role as a subscriber..

01:25:28
<transcript>: Yeah, don't do anything based on what I'm doing here. Don't. Don't take this as like a vote of confidence for using elastic Beansock for sure.

01:25:28
<transcript>: because i'm not

01:25:29
thdxr: for non serverless losers

01:25:31
<transcript>: Because I'm not I'm not saying that.

01:25:31
<transcript>: i can

01:25:36
foobfoob: I just know this because my CDA exam is tomorrow

01:25:37
<transcript>: I can remove my role as the subscriber. Oh, no, no, cow face. You can remove it.

01:25:44
<transcript>: It should add it right back because that's a that's a role change. It should add it right back. Did it add it right back? Cafe.

01:25:53
<transcript>: And if somebody removes their own roll, I guess that's good for them.

01:25:53
<transcript>: that

01:25:56
thechosenone1080: hello mr adam sandler

01:25:57
<transcript>: That was the mistake of theirs. But watch this. If I remove your roll.

01:25:59
<transcript>: Subscriber.

01:25:59
<transcript>: subscribe here

01:26:04
<transcript>: Subscribe. Here we go. I remove it. You should pop right back up here.

01:26:04
<transcript>: because

01:26:07
<transcript>: Because that's the whole point. Oh, I'm not running the bot right now.

01:26:15
<transcript>: It's gonna be running shortly, and then you'll pop right back up there. But you're also a moderator. You're the only you can do that because you're a moderator, right.

01:26:19
thdxr: what the bot do

01:26:21
<transcript>: Hello, the chosen none are chosen one. It looked like none because the n.

01:26:22
cowfacedude99: once the bot is ready...

01:26:26
<transcript>: I just noticed because my cda exams tomorrow. Nice.

01:26:26
<transcript>: dax the

01:26:29
<transcript>: Dax, the bot. The bot just.

01:26:34
<transcript>: Subscribed. It adds a subscriber role. You see this.

01:26:38
<transcript>: It adds a subscriber roll to anybody subscribes to any of our channels.

01:26:38
<transcript>: so if someone subscribe

01:26:50
thdxr: ah nice

01:26:51
<transcript>: So if someone subscribes to you they get to subscriber role. If they subscribe to me they get subscribed roll. And that way we can show them up here as one unified thing of subscribers. And then also we can just make that the thing that they get access to subscribe only channel.

01:26:51
<transcript>: as opposed

01:26:56
<transcript>: As opposed to like having to manually curate that every time we add a new streamer, you know what I'm saying.

01:26:56
<transcript>: that

01:26:57
fragaverage: @cowfacedude99 You're a mod in discord, we got special perms :P

01:26:57
<transcript>: That's all it does.

01:27:02
thechosenone1080: i wanna try gpt-4 but 20dollares :(

01:27:08
<transcript>: You're a modern discord. We've got special perms. That's right, frag. And oh, I could do that. We can make the bot. Also, if it could update.

01:27:08
<transcript>: the moderator

01:27:09
<transcript>: The moderator.

01:27:09
<transcript>: role based

01:27:12
<transcript>: Role based on if you're a moderator for any of the channels.

01:27:12
<transcript>: ooh

01:27:24
<transcript>: Ooh, I love it. And then all the moderators for all the Dev streamers would have the same. I don't know. Do we want to give that power? Dax, do we want every moderator from every channel to have the power to moderate the discord.

01:27:32
<transcript>: Yeah, gbd's. You do have to pay for gpt four.

01:27:32
<transcript>: the schedule

01:27:36
<transcript>: The Scheduled action name cannot be blank scheduled action name.

01:27:39
<transcript>: Not like this chat. Gpt.

01:27:43
<transcript>: This is how we don't get anything done. The rest today. This is what's gonna happen.

01:27:45
thdxr: when I stream you can send me gpt4 things to try

01:27:49
<transcript>: Let's see resource handle returned the scheduled action name cannot be blank.

01:27:49
<transcript>: ed

01:27:51
<transcript>: Edge.

01:27:51
<transcript>: action

01:27:52
<transcript>: Action name.

01:27:52
<transcript>: schedule

01:27:54
<transcript>: Schedule.

01:27:58
<transcript>: So Option Name Value Option Name ski.

01:27:58
<transcript>: one

01:27:59
<transcript>: One.

01:28:02
thdxr: Adam how come this needed to be a realtime ws bot

01:28:04
<transcript>: Failed action. Zero. One min. Size.

01:28:07
<transcript>: Trunk Schedule Scheduled action.

01:28:07
<transcript>: option name

01:28:08
<transcript>: Option name.

01:28:11
<transcript>: Let's just actually go to the docs.

01:28:15
<transcript>: Elastic Beanstalk.

01:28:21
<transcript>: The Scheduled action name cannot be blank.

01:28:21
<transcript>: do this

01:28:22
<transcript>: Do this.

01:28:31
<transcript>: When I stream, you can send me gpt four, three things to try, Adam. How come this needed to be a realtime ws bot.

01:28:31
<transcript>: dax

01:28:40
<transcript>: Dax because when someone's role changes, like if they subscribe to one of our channels, they have a role change. And when that role change happens, the event is emitted. We want to respond to that emit the event.

01:28:40
<transcript>: and update

01:28:43
<transcript>: And update their roles. That's why.

01:28:43
<transcript>: and

01:28:53
laytanl_: Discord not have webhooks?

01:28:57
thdxr: wait is the ws for twitch or discord

01:28:58
<transcript>: And I also have gpt four. So I'm gonna be doing some stuff with it here shortly. The Chosen None. And if you want to send me stuff, I can compete with dax on this. Listen, I can show you some chat. Gvt Four, we'll do nothing today. I'll just do that. That's all I'll do. Just kidding.

01:29:00
<transcript>: What's the problem here.

01:29:10
<transcript>: It's for Discord backs, not twitch. It just responds to disc board role changes. Discord roll changes. So twitch updates, discord or something.

01:29:10
<transcript>: upd

01:29:18
thdxr: oh discord doesn't have webhook?

01:29:22
mhuggins7278: webhooks did support the role change action

01:29:22
<transcript>: Updates discord. We sync our Twitch in our discords. So discord roles change whenever someone subscribes, and then when that role change happens, we have we apply the general subscriber role to them, or we remove it if they if they unsubscribe.

01:29:26
<transcript>: Discord doesn't have Webhood. It does have webhook.

01:29:26
<transcript>: it

01:29:31
<transcript>: It doesn't allow you to subscribe to an event for role changes on the Web hooks. That's a problem.

01:29:31
<transcript>: i trust

01:29:40
<transcript>: I trust man. I went down that route. I wanted to use web hooks. You can't get the data that you need for this particular use case. It's all a big bummer.

01:29:40
<transcript>: i

01:29:42
<transcript>: I do hate it.

01:29:47
thdxr: final question, what about cron + lambda

01:29:48
<transcript>: But here's this is where we are. We're using EC two instances.

01:29:55
<transcript>: What about cron plus lambda? Like just not have real time. We could do that.

01:29:55
<transcript>: yeah we

01:29:57
<transcript>: Yeah, we could have just said.

01:29:59
<transcript>: Do it every minute or something.

01:30:00
kociqq: hello ayezeeHey

01:30:01
<transcript>: Would that been way better.

01:30:03
thechosenone1080: todays interview went well if i pass i will write js for a living :(

01:30:05
<transcript>: Cozy, Hello.

01:30:08
laytanl_: Yh just run it every minute

01:30:15
kociqq: did I hear right

01:30:15
<transcript>: The chosen none. I'm so happy that your interview went well. I'm not sure if the writing js for a living, if.

01:30:15
<transcript>: you're happy

01:30:16
kociqq: EC2?

01:30:18
<transcript>: You're happy tears or sad tears about that.

01:30:19
cowfacedude99: every hour would have been ok....

01:30:24
<transcript>: Just run it every minute. Should I just do that next? Should I just forget about all this lasted beansock, stuff.

01:30:25
thdxr: idk if it's better, just serverless addiction

01:30:28
<transcript>: I liked the real time nature of.

01:30:28
<transcript>: serverless

01:30:29
thechosenone1080: sad but anything for money init?

01:30:34
<transcript>: Serverless addiction. Yeah, I get you. Let's just see if I can get the scheduler action thing working here shortly. And if I can't.

01:30:39
<transcript>: Then we'll go that route. That'll take more time, though. See, I'll take more time.

01:30:42
<transcript>: More time.

01:30:46
laytanl_: Websockets add a lot of overhead/complexity imo

01:30:47
<transcript>: Here's the namespace. Here we go. Resource name. So I have to say.

01:30:47
<transcript>: schedule

01:30:49
<transcript>: Scheduled action.

01:30:49
<transcript>: resource

01:30:54
<transcript>: Resource name and option name. So the chat gpt did lead me a stray here.

01:30:57
<transcript>: It's like this.

01:30:57
<transcript>: it's

01:31:02
<transcript>: It's like this one. Like that. Like this. Okay, I mess up. Stop saying something like that.

01:31:02
<transcript>: scheduled act

01:31:04
<transcript>: Scheduled action.

01:31:04
<transcript>: like this

01:31:05
<transcript>: Like this.

01:31:09
<transcript>: And like this.

01:31:13
<transcript>: And this is gonna be oh, no, no.

01:31:27
<transcript>: That so resource name. Oh, it says that. That's not a thing. Oh, it's probably. No, wait, what? Oh, it's camel case or whatever resource name.

01:31:29
<transcript>: Option.

01:31:29
<transcript>: name

01:31:31
<transcript>: Name.

01:31:34
<transcript>: So scheduled.

01:31:34
<transcript>: scale

01:31:37
<transcript>: Scale up so this is the name.

01:31:40
<transcript>: Yep.

01:31:45
<transcript>: And then option name.

01:31:49
<transcript>: Oh, what's the option name for the actual Cron.

01:31:49
<transcript>: oh no

01:31:51
<transcript>: Oh no.

01:31:56
<transcript>: Start time.

01:32:00
<transcript>: This is for auto scaling scheduled action.

01:32:01
thdxr: dude

01:32:04
<transcript>: Don't be afraid of Meg.

01:32:06
thdxr: use an SST job lmao

01:32:09
<transcript>: What about a Cron.

01:32:11
<transcript>: Recurrent.

01:32:11
<transcript>: oh this is so

01:32:12
<transcript>: Oh, this is so wrong.

01:32:16
<transcript>: This is so wrong.

01:32:20
<transcript>: This is wrong. That's okay.

01:32:21
thdxr: idk what it'll cost though

01:32:25
<transcript>: Web talks had a lot of overhead complexity. I know, I hate it.

01:32:29
<transcript>: Using ssd. Job.

01:32:29
<transcript>: don't know

01:32:31
<transcript>: Don't know what it'll cost.

01:32:40
<transcript>: I just don't want to do something that's a lot different than what I'm already doing, because I don't want to spend the time. I want to be done with this in ten minutes. I want to be done.

01:32:40
<transcript>: i gotta move on

01:32:44
<transcript>: I gotta move on scheduled action resource name scheduled action Zero one.

01:32:44
<transcript>: option name

01:32:48
<transcript>: Option name is like, we got to do this. We got to do this.

01:32:52
<transcript>: Option name.

01:32:53
<transcript>: Is going to be.

01:32:58
thdxr: move onto real work? boo

01:33:00
<transcript>: Start time, and then we have a recurrence. So we have both start time and recurrence.

01:33:10
<transcript>: Start time.

01:33:14
<transcript>: And it's going to be.

01:33:16
<transcript>: Format.

01:33:30
<transcript>: this is

thdxr: this is the bad part of cloud we try to avoid

01:34:06
<transcript>: Recurrence.

01:34:10
<transcript>: So dramatic recurrence.

01:34:12
<transcript>: The value for this one is going to be.

01:34:18
<transcript>: This.

01:34:23
<transcript>: If chabby D? Chat dvd was right.

01:34:23
<transcript>: scheduled action

01:34:25
thdxr: change topic to "12x AWS certified beast sets up elastic beanstalk"

01:34:34
<transcript>: Scheduled action. Okay. So I can delete that one. So we have start time. We have recurrence. Now. We have min sized Max size. What's that desired capacity. I don't think any of that's right.

01:34:38
<transcript>: What do I want to happen on this action? I want to restart.

01:34:42
<transcript>: Wait. What.

01:34:49
<transcript>: Min size. Max eyes. Desired capacity. That's gonna restart it. I don't believe you.

01:34:51
thdxr: what happens if you delete those settings Adam

01:34:51
<transcript>: Let's just see if there's a.

01:34:55
<transcript>: Restart.

01:34:56
thdxr: are they needed

01:34:58
<transcript>: Elastic, beansock, elastic.

01:34:58
<transcript>: beansocked

01:35:02
<transcript>: Beansocked I just got done praising Chat dvt and now it has led me astray.

01:35:02

<transcript>: No. What? There should be just like configuration for this, right.

01:35:19
<transcript>: Should be right.

01:35:22
<transcript>: How to restart on a schedule.

01:35:27
thechosenone1080: i love how chatgpt-3 is already old shit lmao

01:35:27
<transcript>: What happens if you delete those settings? Are they needed.

01:35:35
<transcript>: Twelve times 80s or if I be sets up elastic beansock I love it.

01:35:40
<transcript>: My head hurts really bad doing anything cloud. Especially zur.

01:35:40
<transcript>: zurm

01:35:45
<transcript>: Zurm, this is bad part of cloud we try to avoid. I know it really is.

01:35:58
<transcript>: This has got to be. They've got to have it right here. Right. Let's find out. This is like a script that runs on roof. Okay, forget it. We're never restarting it. Our code is so good, it doesn't need to restart.

01:35:58
<transcript>: forget about it

01:36:09
<transcript>: Forget about it. I added that code specifically because I thought I should probably reachard it every day. And turns out it's all bad. I don't want to do that.

01:36:09
<transcript>: so i

01:36:12
<transcript>: So I am instantly profile. Let's see.

01:36:12
<transcript>: let's just go with that

01:36:13
<transcript>: Let's just go with that.

01:36:13
thdxr: just add a for loop with a memory leak that'll crash it once in a while

01:36:21
<transcript>: Let's go. We don't need to restart. You only need to restart if your code is bad. If you have memory leaks and stuff.

01:36:21
<transcript>: i don't have that

01:36:22
<transcript>: I don't have that.

01:36:33
<transcript>: Just out of for loop with a memory leak that'll crash it once in a while. It's a good point, Mario thanks so much for that. Follow.

01:36:42
<transcript>: Okay, we're waiting on Cloud for my formation. Now, this feels like a dax stream.

<transcript>: Maybe maybe we'll take a little break.

01:36:44
<transcript>: and

01:36:47

01:37:19
<transcript>: If, like I had an infinite supply of larbars, and they had no impact on my health, I would literally eat ten of them a day. There's another my favorite food.

01:37:22
<transcript>: I eat them every day and I never get tired of them.

01:37:32
thdxr: I might just get a goxlr or a rodecaster, doing some research and seems like they do dsp well and work on Linux

laytanl_: If I was the company behind larabar I would say he's already promoting us, so why would we sponsor

01:38:55
<transcript>: All I ask is for an infinite supply of pineapple kombucha. Yes.

01:38:55
<transcript>: they're pretty

01:38:57
<transcript>: They're pretty expensive.

01:38:58
cowfacedude99: does goxlr have have linux support? last I checked(during the LTT shenanigans) they didn't support officially.

01:39:07
<transcript>: If I was a company behind Larbar, I would say he's already promoting us. So why would you sponsor? Yeah, no, that's the argument, Lady, I don't think my case is very good.

01:39:13
<transcript>: I do know people buy larbars because I eat them on stream.

01:39:13
<transcript>: so i

01:39:20
thdxr: not officially but people say it works perfectly

01:39:23
<transcript>: So I feel like I should get some kind of affiliate link or a kickback in some form, but I don't know how to reach lara. I think it's actually a person named Laura. I think.

01:39:24
thdxr: need.to.confirm

01:39:28
<transcript>: Go out to our car a. Does go explore have linux support.

fragaverage: @thdxr Mine has suffered with coil whine out of one of the outputs, but it has 2.   I use windows as main, and mac sometimes. Windows = Easy Mac = pain.  No comments on the Linux side, but if its anything like the Mac setup, there are some hoops to jump through

01:39:41
<transcript>: Your chat amongst each other. You guys are just talking to each other and I'm just reading it.

01:39:47
<transcript>: Do you like that.

01:39:51

01:40:03
mecoupz: quick question: any reason for streaming on twitch onstead of yt?

01:40:09
<transcript>: Oh no, when was easy? Mac pain? No comments on the linux side, but if it's anything like the Mac setup.

01:40:09
<transcript>: there are some hoops

01:40:11
<transcript>: There are some Hoops to jump through.

01:40:17
<transcript>: Quick question. Any reason for streaming on twitch instead of YouTube.

01:40:18
<transcript>: Yeah. I just enjoy.

01:40:18
<transcript>: twitch more i

01:40:20
thdxr: goxlr aesthetic is a bit ugly for me

01:40:21
<transcript>: Twitch. More. I don't know. It's just more fun.

01:40:21
cowfacedude99: @mecoupz chats...

01:40:25
<transcript>: Something about YouTube. Feels.

01:40:25
<transcript>: less fun

01:40:26
<transcript>: Less fun.

01:40:31
<transcript>: Think early on as I was doing a lot of stuff with Channel points.

01:40:32
elliot0x01: Are you a single monitor guy or multi monitor setup ?

01:40:35
thdxr: yt is so much less interactive

01:40:36
cowfacedude99: !lurk

01:40:39
<transcript>: I went through that phase, and I think that's probably why I like twitch, because I could, like, do things where people could redeem channel points.

01:40:39
<transcript>: i stopped

01:40:46
<transcript>: Kv and D. Santos thanks for shopping.

01:40:52
<transcript>: Are you a single monitor guy or multimodor setup? I'm a single monitor guy.

01:40:52

<transcript>: Let's just watch it.

01:41:26
typosrry: @FragAverage I enjoy Windows and Mac as well since WSL2 dropped. There are many pros of windows, like outlook, where you can track all your emails and native Teams client instead of a PWA.

01:41:28
mecoupz: is that "zoom-in-adams-face" thing still on? lol

01:41:30
<transcript>: Coding with Luke. Welcome to chap.

01:41:30
<transcript>: the chocolate

01:41:34
<transcript>: The chocolate is fantastic. It's actually a lara bar.

01:41:38
<transcript>: I need a Larbar command.

01:41:47
<transcript>: Is that Zoom in Adam spacing? So on. Yes.

01:41:50
<transcript>: It is.

01:41:54
<transcript>: Supposed to be when I make faces.

01:41:54
fragaverage: @thdxr Rodecasters look great, but so big! 😂

01:41:59
<transcript>: But it's actually anytime the model gets very confused.

01:42:07
<transcript>: Do we think this is working.

01:42:10
<transcript>: It created the instance from.

01:42:10
<transcript>: the

01:42:11
<transcript>: The roll.

01:42:16
<transcript>: So now it's working on. Oh, no. It created the Last beanstalk application.

01:42:16
<transcript>: it's creating

01:42:18
<transcript>: It's creating the production environment now.

01:42:23
<transcript>: Riatin. There.

01:42:23
<transcript>: we're getting

01:42:24
cowfacedude99: I think i will store enough points for the one on one call before you bring back the rick rolls. LUL

01:42:25
<transcript>: We're getting there.

01:42:27
mecoupz: we need a larabar command that turns of all the lights in adams room and starts rick roll video on stream :D

01:42:33
<transcript>: Yes, cowplays, do it. I want to do a oneonone call with you.

01:42:36
<transcript>: Store those points.

01:42:40
grasp5533: What are we doing with EBS?

01:42:45
<transcript>: You need a lar barcode command that turns off all the lights and Adams room and starts to Rick, roll video on stream. I could.

01:42:45
<transcript>: i could

01:42:51
<transcript>: I could wire up channel points to my lights, but that would just make me sad if my light started flashing.

01:42:51
<transcript>: oh it's done

01:42:52
<transcript>: Oh, it's done.

01:42:58
<transcript>: It's done. Does that mean it's working? Is calfaced back in the subscriber list.

01:42:59
<transcript>: No.

01:43:04
<transcript>: That means we have to look at some logs. Unfortunately.

01:43:09
<transcript>: How long could this take.

01:43:12
<transcript>: Forever. It could take forever.

01:43:17
<transcript>: I think that followed. Pusherm. What are we doing with EBS.

01:43:17
<transcript>: un

01:43:18
fragaverage: @thdxr Ever looked at the Beacn Mix? has an unofficial Linux app and looks quite cool

01:43:21
<transcript>: Unfortunately, we're doing things with EBS graph. Well, not EBS. But.

01:43:25
<transcript>: We are working with EC Two. Unfortunately.

01:43:34
<transcript>: Sign in right.

01:43:38
<transcript>: Yeah. So I need to go to elastic Beanstalk.

01:43:38
<transcript>: what

01:43:40
<transcript>: What a service.

01:43:46
<transcript>: I'm sorry. So there's anyone from the elastic being stock.

01:43:53
<transcript>: Team that's like in my audience. I'm sorry if I shame your team's work.

01:43:57
<transcript>: Environment Health is transitioned from pinning to warning.

01:44:01
<transcript>: Unable to assume roll.

01:44:05
<transcript>: Excuse me. Oh.

01:44:05
<transcript>: that service

01:44:08
<transcript>: That service role may not exist.

01:44:14
<transcript>: I don't need the service role unless it makes you have it. I don't need it.

01:44:18
<transcript>: Also don't need the health check I don't think.

01:44:24
<transcript>: What's the batch size? Like? What is that.

01:44:28
<transcript>: I don't know what any of that is.

01:44:42
<transcript>: I think I can cut out a bunch of this stuff. We need an instant profile instance profile to give the roll get secret value permissions. We want the instant type we want single instance. We got to pass in the secret arn. That's it.

01:44:44
<transcript>: That's it.

01:44:44
<transcript>: all we gotta do

01:44:46
<transcript>: All we gotta do.

01:44:53

01:44:55
fossabot: Check the panels below the twitch video player to view all of Adam's setup including Video, Audio & Furniture!

01:44:57

01:44:57
<transcript>: i have to use

01:44:59
<transcript>: I have to use EC two instances.

01:44:59
<transcript>: as much

01:45:02
<transcript>: As much as it hurts my soul.

01:45:19
<transcript>: If it's a worker type, I need to set it to a worker instance type so it doesn't need a health check, right. Or does it still have a help deck? I don't know.

01:45:22
<transcript>: Elastic Beanstalk.

01:45:22
<transcript>: cloud

01:45:24

<transcript>: Update it completely. It probably doesn't have access to write to the logs which sucks.

01:47:27
<transcript>: Because I won't be able to do this.

01:47:30
<transcript>: Maybe you can. I don't know.

01:47:33
<transcript>: Maybe cloudformation takes care of that for you.

01:47:40
uberrick: Hey Adam

01:47:42
<transcript>: I haven't done anything with Azure.

01:47:42
<transcript>: rick is

01:47:49
<transcript>: Rick is here. Hey, Rick, How's it going? I don't think the logs work, but let's see if it added calfhes back. No.

01:47:54
<transcript>: Face.

01:47:54
<transcript>: you should

01:47:56
<transcript>: You should be a subscriber.

01:48:03
<transcript>: So I'm gonna have to do stuff. I'm gonna do more stuff.

01:48:03
<transcript>: this sucks

01:48:08
<transcript>: This sucks. This sucks so bad. So we need to create another roll.

01:48:11
<transcript>: Service, roll.

01:48:16
<transcript>: Thanks so much for that. What was that? What was that.

01:48:16
<transcript>: sub

01:48:17
<transcript>: Sub.

01:48:17
<transcript>: subcription

01:48:26
<transcript>: Subcription I don't see to my activity feed yet so we're gonna have a service role where we at are we almost at 2 hours? I gotta be done at 2 hours have to be.

01:48:30
<transcript>: Service roll. We got too much to do.

01:48:33
<transcript>: What is this role need to look like.

01:48:36
<transcript>: How does it need to look.

01:48:36
<transcript>: that

01:48:39
<transcript>: That's the instance role.

01:48:39
<transcript>: i guess i should

01:48:43
<transcript>: I guess I should probably have it managed. Yeah, I should do this.

01:48:47
<transcript>: Add some managed policies.

01:48:51
<transcript>: Rick. Five months.

01:48:55
<transcript>: Five months. They thank you so much, Rick, for the prime sub.

01:48:55
<transcript>: five months

01:49:02
<transcript>: Five months. Wow, it's wild that I've been streaming five months. Doesn't feel like it's been that long.

01:49:07
uberrick: Frag has 8 haha

01:49:08
<transcript>: I appreciate your five months, Rick. You were smart and didn't sub while I was doing anything.

01:49:17
<transcript>: There's some people who've said, like, eight months, and I have not. Yeah. Frag has sub for eight months, and I have not streamed for eight months. So sorry about that, brag.

01:49:17
<transcript>: this one

01:49:20
<transcript>: This one needs to be elastic Beanstalk.

<transcript>: so this is

01:49:49
<transcript>: So this is our service role and we need to add some managed policy arms to it.

01:50:02
<transcript>: Kind of just add strings here.

01:50:04
<transcript>: Oh no.

01:58:16
<transcript>: Command Service Response Instance One you didn't specify a node js version of the package json file on your source bundle. The deployment didn't install specific node Jazz version. I hate you I hate you elastic Beanstalk I hate you.

01:58:18
<transcript>: Why am I doing this.

01:58:20

01:58:35
foobfoob: adam is there a specific reason why you prefer EB over a container in fargate?

01:58:42
<transcript>: What a dumb service. I'm sorry. It's just dumb. I said here, I want to use this vm that has no js 16. Why would I have to put it in my package? Json? I don't even know how to put it in my package. Json.

01:58:46
<transcript>: This is so dumb.

01:58:49
teej_dv: ask chat gpt

01:58:52
thdxr: think he didn't want to think about docker

01:58:55
<transcript>: So I have to put it in here. Like what version? No. Dependencies.

01:58:58
mono_nz: node.engine or something

01:59:01
foobfoob: ok

01:59:02
<transcript>: Node. Where do I put it? Just tell me what I have to do. Engines. Here we go. Node. This is so dumb.

01:59:02
<transcript>: how

01:59:04
<transcript>: How dumb is this.

01:59:05
thdxr: but there is a super minimal Fargate construct

01:59:07
tayloreddev: this frustration sums up my cloud experiences in the past

01:59:10
<transcript>: So engines node greater than or equal to 16, I guess.

01:59:13
<transcript>: Oh, my goodness.

01:59:16
<transcript>: Oh, my goodness, I hate it.

01:59:19
<transcript>: I hate it.

01:59:23
<transcript>: And do I have to do it.

01:59:26
<transcript>: In the this.

01:59:30
<transcript>: Let's do it in this package. Json probably.

01:59:30
<transcript>: yeah it'd be

01:59:31
mhuggins7278: in the root

01:59:37
thdxr: adam should do non serverless stuff in private so people don't think this is what the cloud is

01:59:38
<transcript>: Yeah, it'd be this one. But I guess is the dis. Does the disf holder have packed Json? It doesn't. I'm not deploying a package. Json.

01:59:40
<transcript>: Does it need to have a package json.

01:59:44
<transcript>: Oh, my goodness, this is so dumb.

01:59:44
<transcript>: we

01:59:47
<transcript>: We're gonna say greater than 16.

01:59:47
<transcript>: less

01:59:53
teej_dv: @thdxr probably safer for him to write all his code in private

01:59:59
uberrick: LUL

02:00:00
<transcript>: Less than 18. I don't know. I don't know if that's the way to do this. I don't should do nonservice stuff in private. So people don't think this is what cloud is. Yeah. This is not the cloud, people. This is not the cloud. This is something entirely different. This sucks.

02:00:03
<transcript>: So we need to build.

02:00:05
<transcript>: Tsc.

02:00:05
<transcript>: and

02:00:12

<transcript>: Make sure it actually copies it.

schrew: *editing package.json* THIS is the cloud

02:00:37
<transcript>: Okay, it does. This is so dumb. Oh, my goodness.

02:00:41
<transcript>: What a cursed service.

thdxr: @teej_dv LUL

02:00:46
<transcript>: You can feel the HH watching.

02:00:46
<transcript>: sorry

02:00:47
<transcript>: Sorry.

02:00:49
<transcript>: Don't get me started.

02:00:49
<transcript>: this is

samulnik: could you share your nvim config?

02:01:01
<transcript>: This is what dh thinks the class is. Oh, man, it's because of people like me. Look at me. I'm like, I know, aws, and I'm doing this stuff, and they're like, that's awful use mercy. Instead, I'm part of the problem.

02:01:07
<transcript>: Part of the problem.

02:01:10
<transcript>: Sam'l. Welcome to Chat. I sure could.

uberrick: @Rollingx common mistake

02:01:17
<transcript>: From my injury config lives You've probably better off looking at teaches.

02:01:17
<transcript>: look at

02:01:18
thdxr: I do all my k8s stuff in private

02:01:20
<transcript>: Look at his kickstart, env and go from there.

02:01:23
<transcript>: Probably say for write all his code.

02:01:29
<transcript>: It's a good burn node. That engine. You didn't want to think about Docker.

02:01:36
<transcript>: There's reason why you prefer eb over a container in Fargate. Great question, food boob. Maybe I should have just used Fargate.

02:01:36
<transcript>: i

02:01:41
<transcript>: I guess that is better. Yeah, I should have done that. Why did I do EC Two? I don't know.

02:01:45
<transcript>: Cuz fargates there's actually some pretty good cdk constructs for that.

02:01:56
<transcript>: People are going to look at the cdk code and think it's ssd. Oh, no, you're ruining our rep. You know what, dax? You get the good with the bad. Okay, I talk about ssc very highly around here.

02:01:56
<transcript>: i'm

02:02:02
<transcript>: I'm showing it at every corner. Sometimes you're gonna get some bad pub. I'm sorry about it.

02:02:07
<transcript>: You do all your case stuff in private? Yeah, I would do.

02:02:07
<transcript>: i should

02:02:11
trivenge: working hard today?

02:02:12
<transcript>: I should have used Fargate shoulda should have coulda.

02:02:12
<transcript>: that would have been

02:02:14
<transcript>: That would have been better.

02:02:16
<transcript>: Mmhmm.

02:02:19
<transcript>: Thank you for that. Follow.

02:02:19
thdxr: shoulda used C R O N

02:02:20
grasp5533: is App Runner any good?

02:02:25
thdxr: vercel has cron now

02:02:27
<transcript>: Yan I appreciate it working hard today, trivh we're working on hard stuff that shouldn't be hard.

02:02:34
thdxr: MINDBLOWING

02:02:35
<transcript>: Should he use Cron versell? Has Cron now? Yeah, there are a million ways I could have done this that are not.

02:02:35
<transcript>: elastic beans

02:02:37
<transcript>: Elastic beansock in EC two instances.

02:02:37
<transcript>: why

02:02:39
<transcript>: Why.

02:02:39
<transcript>: why did i do

02:02:40
<transcript>: Why did I do this.

02:02:46
<transcript>: Versailles. Cron. Now mind blowing. You can do cron jobs.

02:02:46
<transcript>: frontend

02:02:52
<transcript>: Frontend developers don't know what they're getting into. They're about to get exposed to some stuff.

02:03:04
<transcript>: The first cell put some kind of abstraction over, like chron expressions. I bet they did.

02:03:04
<transcript>: i bet

02:03:07
<transcript>: I bet they put something that, like, translates.

02:03:07
<transcript>: front end speed

02:03:12
<transcript>: Front end Speed into a chronic freshen to not expose.

02:03:12
<transcript>: the delicate

02:03:16
<transcript>: The delicate front end devs like dax to chronic freshions.

02:03:16
<transcript>: if you

02:03:19
thdxr: Its literally a thing that hits a public API endpoint in your nextjs app lol

02:03:25
sockthedev: write it is as jsx?

02:03:26
<transcript>: If you wonder why I'm just sitting here not doing anything on my screen because we're waiting on cloudformation if you wonder why we're waiting on cloudformation is because I chose to use elastic beanstalk, because I'm done.

02:03:26
<transcript>: as d

02:03:29
<transcript>: As Dance thanks so much for that follow.

02:03:35
thdxr: haha

02:03:35
<transcript>: Literally a thing that hits a public API endpoint in your next js app. Oh really.

02:03:35
<transcript>: that's

02:03:38
yanvallejo: Astro is very different to next JS?

02:03:39
<transcript>: That's their cron. It just hits your api route. That's awesome.

02:03:41
uberrick: Looks like you're waiting on SST

02:03:45
<transcript>: Hey, zach. So I'm gonna make this code public, and I'm gonna let you go ahead and swap out everything I just did.

02:03:45
<transcript>: and

02:03:48
<transcript>: And run this node js and something else. That'd be great.

02:03:48
<transcript>: yan

02:03:53
<transcript>: Yan welcome to Chat astro is very different to Next js yes, it is very different.

02:03:53
<transcript>: it looks

02:03:55
thdxr: I'm down to do that

02:03:57
<transcript>: It looks like I'm waiting on ssc. Stop it. Rick.

02:03:57
<transcript>: next is gonna be

02:04:05
thdxr: set my stream topic to "fixing Adams code"

02:04:10
<transcript>: Next is gonna be very upset with me. You're down to do that. That would be great. Dax, do it on stream so you can teach people the right way to use ssd. I'm gonna push this repo, and you're gonna do that. And it's gonna be amazing. This is like a good cop. Bad cop.

02:04:12
<transcript>: I'm the bad cop.

02:04:12
<transcript>: and i did the

02:04:14
<transcript>: And I did the dumb thing.

02:04:14
<transcript>: i'll see if

02:04:18
<transcript>: I'll see if it just worked. The calf face good. Is no. Okay.

02:04:18
<transcript>: okay

02:04:18
thdxr: I'm also bad cop

02:04:19
<transcript>: Okay.

02:04:27
<transcript>: 805. Here we go. Are we doing this? The entire stream? Is this gonna be the entire stream? It can't be. It shouldn't be.

02:04:27
<transcript>: so we're

02:04:29
<transcript>: So we're running, Hey.

02:04:34
<transcript>: Hey, I think it's working.

02:04:41
<transcript>: I don't see any errors. Any new errors.

02:04:41
<transcript>: so

02:04:47
the_true_jinx: is this your company codebase?

02:04:48
<transcript>: So if it's working, then where is cow face? Oh, I have to update his roles. So let's update calfase.

02:04:52
<transcript>: Let's remove.

02:04:59
<transcript>: I'm gonna remove moderator. Sorry. Cafes. You're not here to tell me not to did it work? Did it work.

02:04:59
<transcript>: it did

02:05:01
<transcript>: It did not work.

02:05:03
trivenge: saw a bunch of principal and senior devs freaking out about chatgpt in the next few years. that was odd

02:05:06
<transcript>: Where is he? Calva's. Coffee's. Coffee.

02:05:08
<transcript>: Did it work? No, I didn't work.

02:05:08
<transcript>: coffee

02:05:10
<transcript>: Coffee.

02:05:11
thdxr: I'm realizing Adam is just friends with people who work on everything he uses

02:05:19
<transcript>: Okay, let's let's give it back to him. Give him moderator back, I guess.

02:05:19
<transcript>: so why didn't

02:05:21
<transcript>: So why didn't it work.

02:05:21
<transcript>: do we have

02:05:25
<transcript>: Do we have any logs to indicate why it did not work.

02:05:35
<transcript>: There's cafes does not have subscriber role. Let's try looking at the log again which how do you do that? Last beansock. You request the last 100 lines.

02:05:44
<transcript>: You're also a bad cop. Yeah. Set my stream topic to fixing atoms code. I love it.

02:05:44
<transcript>: is this your company

02:05:47
sockthedev: dax, been hearing wes drop your name in a few of the recent pods. excited man.

02:05:56
<transcript>: Is this your company code base? No, this is not. This is not anyone's company code base. This is a big giant pile of awfulness. So I'll bunch of principle in senior devs freaking out about chatty between the next few years. That was odd.

02:05:56
<transcript>: i realized

02:06:01
<transcript>: I realized item is just friends with people who work on everything he uses. It's true.

02:06:04
<transcript>: Zach's been you teach.

02:06:04
<transcript>: between youtube

02:06:08
<transcript>: Between YouTube, I've got my editor and my.

02:06:11
thdxr: also Fred

02:06:13
<transcript>: Infra is covered framework covered. So here's a request.

02:06:13
thdxr: astro

02:06:15
<transcript>: What is that request.

02:06:19
<transcript>: Is it running? I don't know if it's actually running.

02:06:19
<transcript>: is it

02:06:20
alexkates: sup team

02:06:21
<transcript>: Is it actually running.

02:06:21
<transcript>: let's go

02:06:25
<transcript>: Let's go to our production environment. Help. Okay.

02:06:27
thdxr: @sockthedev idt my episode was great kinda felt all over the place

02:06:30
<transcript>: It acts like it's running. But calf A is not getting his new role.

02:06:30
<transcript>: so

02:06:35
<transcript>: So it's not running or it's not working. Something is wrong.

02:06:37
<transcript>: Let's go back to logs.

02:06:43
thdxr: but we'll see that magic Chris works (the editor, he does our podcast too!)

02:06:46
mhuggins7278: since there are neovim folks here anyone else using lazy

02:06:53
<transcript>: Just request another hundred lines. What do you say? And is that 100 lines of application logs? No, it's a hundred lines of every possible log that machine will spit out. What are eb industry logs? I don't know, but I have them. And.

02:06:53
<transcript>: what are access logs

02:06:57
<transcript>: What are access logs? Those are cool, except it's not a web service, so I don't need those.

02:07:04
<transcript>: This just says it's running no js. App. Js. Wait, it's not called AppJS.

02:07:04
<transcript>: the

02:07:08
<transcript>: The app is not called appjs. It's Index JS.

02:07:08
<transcript>: let's

02:07:11
<transcript>: Let's look at the environment. Let's make sure.

02:07:15
<transcript>: It just didn't even use my code.

02:07:15
<transcript>: it's not even using

02:07:17
<transcript>: It's not even using it, is it.

02:07:20
<transcript>: Oh, my word is it even using my code.

02:07:24
<transcript>: Production.

02:07:24
<transcript>: i don't think

02:07:26
<transcript>: I don't think it's even using my code.

02:07:30
thdxr: AWS decided the best thing was to not use your code

02:07:31
<transcript>: I don't think it uploaded. Hang on. Where do I find that configuration.

02:07:32
teej_dv: yeah, i use it mhuggins

02:07:37
<transcript>: Software Instances Capacity load balancer Security modeling.

02:07:43
alexkates: @thdxr adamdo8DealWithIt adamdo8DealWithIt

02:07:45
<transcript>: Where do I find if it's actually running my code.

02:07:50
<transcript>: It is decided the best thing was not use your code.

02:07:50
<transcript>: oh man

02:07:53
<transcript>: Oh, man. Okay, I guess.

02:07:54
binajmen: you could see timings in Application versions

02:07:57
<transcript>: I guess we should just abandon this easy two thing. Shouldn't we.

02:07:57
uberrick: @thdxr yeah it was like "we don't want an outage"

02:08:00
mhuggins7278: I get this when I run checkhealth lazy but I don't see any errors in any of the plugins - ERROR: Issues were reported when loading your specs:

02:08:07
<transcript>: What's the fastest way for me to just abandon.

02:08:07
<transcript>: ec

02:08:08
mhuggins7278: any suggestions on debugging

02:08:10
<transcript>: Ec Two, and just get this thing running.

02:08:10
<transcript>: i don't want to do

02:08:10
binajmen: 14-03

02:08:12
alexkates: joining late, what's goin on?

02:08:14
<transcript>: I don't want to do cron. I could just do crime, but I don't want to because it's not real time.

02:08:14
<transcript>: we

02:08:16
<transcript>: We want real time people.

02:08:16
<transcript>: what

02:08:18
thdxr: use the cdk Fargate thing

02:08:19
<transcript>: What's going on? Alex? I'm distracted.

02:08:20
sockthedev: build on prem

02:08:22
alexkates: HAHA

02:08:25
foobfoob: go fargate

02:08:28
<transcript>: Cdk Park I think that's a good call. Let's actually a great call. Let's do the cdk. That's a great call.

02:08:29
thdxr: it's pretty easy just have to deal with a lil docker

02:08:32
<transcript>: It's like load balance, load balance.

02:08:32
<transcript>: application

02:08:33
<transcript>: Application? Something.

02:08:36
cmjio: checkout aws lightsail

02:08:38
<transcript>: Yeah. Ecs patterns. Let's just use this.

02:08:38
<transcript>: we're using this

02:08:39
<transcript>: We're using this.

02:08:44
<transcript>: Now, the problem with this is I don't actually need a load balance. I just need the tiniest thing possible.

02:08:49
<transcript>: But we'll use it load balanced.

02:08:49
<transcript>: far

02:08:51
<transcript>: Fargate service.

02:08:51
<transcript>: contain

02:08:53
<transcript>: Container image so I have to create.

02:08:53
<transcript>: a container image

02:08:55
<transcript>: A container image from my code. How do I do that.

02:08:58
thdxr: idk man it might need SCALE

02:09:01
<transcript>: I wasn't thinking about the autocad Docker file.

02:09:03
<transcript>: A little Docker.

02:09:03
<transcript>: it might

02:09:05
<transcript>: It might need scale. That's right.

02:09:05
<transcript>: okay

02:09:07
<transcript>: Okay. So.

02:09:13
<transcript>: I can't believe I'm working on this more. I'm gonna work on this longer. This makes me so sad.

02:09:17
<transcript>: Okay, so I have to make a docker file here.

02:09:24
<transcript>: I need a minimal somebody. I'm putting someone to the stats. Someone create me a minimal.

02:09:37
<transcript>: Language server. Sure. Oh, cool. There's a doctor language server, so I need somebody to create me a minimal Docker file for just taking a stupid index JS node file and making it a node service.

02:09:37
<transcript>: just

02:09:39
sockthedev: how does the devicons not have docker?

02:09:44
thdxr: SST job that runs for 8 hours and restarts

02:09:46
<transcript>: Just the simplest Docker file. Somebody give me the contents of the simplest Docker file. Send me a gist that is your job if you choose to accept it.

02:09:46
<transcript>: that would

02:09:48
<transcript>: That would be great.

02:09:53
virtualtablefunction: ChatGTP it

02:09:54
foobfoob: https://github.com/sidpalas/devops-directive-docker-course/blob/main/06-building-container-images/api-node/Dockerfile.9

02:09:56
<transcript>: Okay. And now we're gonna do our stack is gonna change completely. Get rid of all this crap.

02:09:56
<transcript>: all of this

02:09:57
<transcript>: All of this.

02:10:01
<transcript>: This is gone, this is gone.

02:10:06
<transcript>: Asset don't need that anymore.

02:10:09
<transcript>: Or that or an instance profile.

02:10:10
laytanl_: You struggling with this makes my hopes for understanding aws go down the drain

02:10:11
<transcript>: Okay.

02:10:11
<transcript>: whoo

02:10:15
<transcript>: Whoo okay, literally all of it is gone.

02:10:15
<transcript>: we have a secret

02:10:17
<transcript>: We have a secret, which I do need.

02:10:21
sockthedev: your walk of shame

02:10:25
<transcript>: And that's it. Now we're gonna add the Fargate thing while someone makes a docker file. Thank you for.

02:10:32
<transcript>: Is that a concise example? Am I gonna have to sift through a bunch of stuff? This is it. This is what I need.

02:10:32
<transcript>: old

02:10:33
<transcript>: Old I slim.

02:10:33
<transcript>: actually i

02:10:37
<transcript>: Actually, I probably need a base that's, like an AWS.

02:10:37
<transcript>: linux

02:10:38
<transcript>: Linux.

02:10:40
thdxr: you def don't need that much

02:10:43
<transcript>: Ideally. Graviton. Can someone get me that.

02:10:52
thdxr: should be like a 4 line docker file

02:10:53
cmjio: How minimal?  https://gist.github.com/cmjio/5f1c3685dc1d17138f3ee2d5f76b63b7

02:10:53
<transcript>: Definitely don't need this much. This is a lot of stuff. Yeah, I just need it's. Not even a web service. So it's not gonna be exposing anything. It's just gonna be a worker that just runs. Just run the script and that's it.

02:10:57
<transcript>: If you can if somebody could give me that how minimal minimum.

02:11:02
mhuggins7278: we use alpine as our base for workstuff

02:11:03
<transcript>: Ideally deriving from a base image that's on aws node latest might work.

02:11:04
foobfoob: you can take smaller examples from the same folder

02:11:08
<transcript>: I'm gonna put this in there as a placeholder. Can someone tell me it's out of work.

02:11:10
<transcript>: On.

02:11:11
<transcript>: Fargate.

02:11:11
<transcript>: i'm

02:11:14
<transcript>: I'm sure it'll work, but is it ideal.

02:11:14
<transcript>: work dirty

02:11:23
<transcript>: Work dirty. App, copy, app Copy Index js I guess I could have named it App Command node.

02:11:23
<transcript>: index

02:11:29
<transcript>: Index js work dirt is what is work there.

02:11:30
thdxr: LGTM

02:11:32
foobfoob: like this one https://github.com/sidpalas/devops-directive-docker-course/blob/main/06-building-container-images/api-node/Dockerfile.3

02:11:35
thdxr: that just sets cwd

02:11:36
<transcript>: Builds it index js list here in disse. Okay.

02:11:36
<transcript>: so back to

02:11:37
uberrick: working directory

02:11:39
thdxr: so it doesn't matter

02:11:40
<transcript>: So back to our Fargate thing. I hate this so much.

02:11:40
<transcript>: i hate them

02:11:43
cmjio: you might want to copy in the package.json independently as a layer

02:11:43
<transcript>: I hate them. I'm still working on this. I can't believe I'm still working on this.

02:11:47
<transcript>: Let's copy this thing.

02:11:56
<transcript>: Ecs, patterns.

02:12:00
<transcript>: Case. Did you see that.

02:12:04
foobfoob: @cmjio its in the 2nd example I posted

02:12:04
thdxr: you need to npm install adam

02:12:04
<transcript>: Ecs patterns from.

02:12:06
<transcript>: No, no.

02:12:07
thdxr: copy package.json

02:12:10
sockthedev: tagging to latest tho? surely to a specific major.minor at the least?

02:12:11
<transcript>: Let's just do this application load balancer.

02:12:12
mecoupz: kebab-case 4 evaaaaa :D

02:12:13
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:12:20
<transcript>: Service. I need a cluster.

02:12:21
<transcript>: Hot cluster.

02:12:21
<transcript>: equals

02:12:23
<transcript>: Equals.

02:12:28
<transcript>: Sure.

02:12:36
<transcript>: We have a cluster. What do I have to do with the cluster? Do I have to say, like.

02:12:38
<transcript>: Instance sizes or something.

02:12:42
<transcript>: I don't know.

02:12:49
<transcript>: Scope. What's wrong? Oh, Stack, sorry, service. And then.

02:12:53
<transcript>: Container image from registry. No, no.

02:12:53
<transcript>: that's from

02:12:58
<transcript>: That's from image or something. We'll get there. I don't need any subnets stuff.

02:12:58
okufa_f: https://gist.github.com/francis-chang/15bc4f2adea5dfc5926fdafa07422ebb this assumes you have package json with npm run dev / npm run start

02:13:00
<transcript>: I need this.

02:13:12
<transcript>: I don't care about the load balancer name. I don't care if there's a load balancer Zyu can't one I need it only running once it's important. I think that it only runs once. This can be so small. 512.

02:13:16
<transcript>: There's all kinds of weird rules around this, though. 512.

02:13:16
<transcript>: i can use

02:13:19

02:13:38
<transcript>: 256. Okay, so my cluster. I have no settings on. I don't know if I need to. Okay, you guys are giving me all kinds of stuff here. You need to impeam install. Oh, yeah, I need the mpm install.

02:13:44
cmjio: use this https://gist.github.com/cmjio/5f1c3685dc1d17138f3ee2d5f76b63b7

02:13:47
<transcript>: Which one looks good to you, dax, you can take smaller examples from the same folder like this one.

02:13:47
<transcript>: that just sets

02:13:54
<transcript>: That just sets cwd working director. So it doesn't matter. You might want to copy the package json. You need to impeam install copy package json.

02:13:59
<transcript>: A kufa? Is this one.

02:13:59
<transcript>: is this one

02:14:06
<transcript>: Is this one a minimal one from node copy run so late. And what does that mean.

02:14:06
<transcript>: okay so

02:14:11
<transcript>: Okay. So J I o. Use this. Let me look at yours. And then there's another one. So many posts.

<transcript>: See, what is this one.

02:14:18
cmjio: ^^^ this is the updated of my first

02:14:26
<transcript>: Note 18. Can someone tell me? Isn't there, like, an Amazon linux base for node? I feel like there's a node. Amazon linux that'll like pull from ecr faster or something? I don't know.

02:14:29
<transcript>: Someone tell me that.

02:14:29
<transcript>: because

02:14:31
<transcript>: Because someone tell me that.

02:14:41
trivenge: 16

02:14:42
trivenge: i think?

02:14:44
thdxr: it's going to build on your machine

02:14:49
<transcript>: So. But it's a districtory. Can someone tell me, like, is it accounting for the fact that it builds into a dis directory? Or do I just build it in the Docker file.

02:14:50
trivenge: Amazon Linux 2 does not currently support the current LTS release (version 18.x) of Node.js. Use Node.js version 16.x with the following command instead.

02:14:52

<transcript>: it's going to build

02:14:54
<transcript>: It's going to build on your machine.

schrew: I feel like I've always used alpine for node in a container

02:15:00
schrew: on aws

02:15:02
<transcript>: Amazon linux Two does not currently support the current lts release. I want version 16. Yeah, I want version 16.

02:15:08
<transcript>: Alpine would be fine. That's like slim down one. Right.

02:15:08
<transcript>: i gotta

02:15:09
thdxr: your source image is fine

02:15:11
<transcript>: I gotta figure out how to get the image.

02:15:11
<transcript>: while you guys

02:15:13
<transcript>: While you guys are doing that.

02:15:13
<transcript>: my source

02:15:16

02:15:20
<transcript>: Let's go back over here.

02:15:20
<transcript>: i

02:15:22
thdxr: I'd suggest just building on your machine then copying dist/index.js

<transcript>: Positories.

02:18:14
thdxr: you can do it Adam use your people skills

02:18:15

phdhorrible: Why not just publish the image to ECS?

02:19:24
<transcript>: What am I looking at? Cluster? I don't know if I need to configure anything on the cluster.

02:20:12
<transcript>: Construct does that.

02:20:12
<transcript>: subscribe

02:20:20
<transcript>: Subscribe actually seems like a good use case for G 54. I actually used gtpd for gpt four for the elastic pinstar version.

02:20:20
<transcript>: let's see

02:20:26
<transcript>: Let's see. You can do it, Adam. Use your people skills. What was I gonna use my people's skills for.

<transcript>: What they gonna do.

02:20:38
<transcript>: I just got the deal. Like, I don't have technical skills. They're not gonna my people's skills aren't gonna get very far right now. That was a very good joke. Next, I was actually really good. Thank.

02:22:05
<transcript>: We're so close. People. I don't know what I do with the repo name. Why did I have that.

02:22:11
phdhorrible: Huh, I don’t remember it being this verbose last time I set up Fargate and ECS

02:22:12
mjewl: Are we still doing the "it will only take a few minutes" thing? dangOneGuy

02:22:12
<transcript>: Okay, I'm using ssd, but am I using SSC.

02:22:18
<transcript>: Okay. So packages bot. So now I just need a good Docker file, and this service will run.

02:22:22
<transcript>: Service.

02:22:25

02:23:05
<transcript>: okay

02:23:08
<transcript>: Okay, so we just gave it access to read the secret.

02:23:08
<transcript>: that

02:23:20
<transcript>: That's the only permissions it needs. And now I just need a good Docker file where one Docker file away people. So node latest is fine. That's what I'm being told. I think alpine would have been fine. Something small would have been fine. But.

02:23:20
<transcript>: today

02:23:26
<transcript>: Today on Adam Stream. He undoes two years of cloud PR improvement. We've done an sst. Sorry. Next.

02:23:35
<transcript>: Phd, horrible. Don't remember it being this verbose. Last time you set up Fargate and ecs. Maybe not. Are you using the cdk pd, PhD.

02:23:38
<transcript>: It will only take a few minutes saying that's right.

02:23:38
<transcript>: that's the

<transcript>: delete

02:23:58
<transcript>: Delete.

02:23:58
<transcript>: so

02:24:00
okufa_f: what's the benefit of fargate as opposed to just using an ec2 instance?

02:24:01
<transcript>: So we're deleting that that's good.

02:24:06
<transcript>: And then my Docker file? What's my Docker file? Need to be just this.

02:24:10
phdhorrible: Work with Azure nowadays, so no CDK anymore

02:24:13
<transcript>: Copy npm install so what's the work Dur app need to be.

02:24:19
phdhorrible: Been looking at using Pulumi though

02:24:20
thdxr: workdir can be anything

02:24:21
<transcript>: Is that the director on my machine? This is why I hate docker. I can never remember. Like, are we talking my machine? We talking. What are we talking.

02:24:25
thdxr: workdir is in the container

02:24:27
uberrick: it can be anything and it's inside the container

02:24:28
fragaverage: So, uhhhh, Heroku? 😂

02:24:28
<transcript>: This is the same thing. Now it's different. So we copy index JS.

02:24:32
<transcript>: It's actually dissed index js. Right.

02:24:36
<transcript>: What's worked? There can be anything. It's in the container.

02:24:36
<transcript>: hey well

02:24:43
<transcript>: Hey. Well, I don't. What if it could be anything? What does it need to be? I don't need to be anything. Do I need a worker? Whatever. Okay.

02:24:46
okufa_f: if your build output is in dist

02:24:50
<transcript>: Hey, docker, copy the index js. We're gonna also copy.

02:24:51
<transcript>: Package json.

02:24:56
<transcript>: Wait. Is this relative to.

02:24:56
<transcript>: where the docker

02:24:58
<transcript>: Where the Docker file is.

02:25:01
thdxr: yes

02:25:03
<transcript>: Inside the container.

02:25:06
thdxr: relative to dockerfile

02:25:09
<transcript>: It's relative to the Docker file. So this index JS and then.

02:25:18
thdxr: package.json npm o

02:25:20
cazcik: consider node:18-alpine as the base, it'll be a bit smaller

02:25:21
<transcript>: So package dates on I don't need to do that in that build script anymore. And then I need to do.

02:25:21
<transcript>: run

02:25:22
<transcript>: Run.

02:25:22
thdxr: npm i

02:25:24
<transcript>: Npm install.

02:25:31
<transcript>: And then command node index js, but it's dis indexed. Yes. Right. Is that right.

02:25:36
<transcript>: It cop. No, it's copying index js into the root. So does this look right.

02:25:40
<transcript>: Does this look right? Somebody tell me.

02:25:44
<transcript>: Npmi.

02:25:48
ayushsharma: Is it a intel Mac?

02:25:52
<transcript>: Package json mpm Oh.

02:25:57
<transcript>: No. 18 alpine Is base would be a bit smaller. Yeah, I don't need it to be very big.

02:28:14
thdxr: just see if it starts

02:28:18
<transcript>: Well, I'm hoping to put once and it's gonna run forever, and I'm never gonna need to change anything.

uberrick: it's just docker images

02:29:27
thdxr: if you did docker build the resulting hash is the image

02:29:27
uberrick: no ls

02:29:32

02:30:35
okufa_f: you can docker run 73e

02:30:39
mhuggins7278: i don't think you want the sha256:

mjewl: LUL

02:31:19
neochromer: uf

02:31:20
<transcript>: He's right there. Cool pants. How do I pass an environment variable into this thing? I need an environment variable in this thing.

02:31:31
<transcript>: Chara. Welcome to Chat. It's the highest quality stream I've ever seen. I kind of want to give you, like a vip badge, just for saying that.

02:31:31

<transcript>: Let's try it. How do I give vip badges.

02:31:33
<transcript>: let's just make you a

<transcript>: Let's just make you a mod.

02:31:39
mecoupz: chara you can have the same quality for $50k though :D

02:31:39
<transcript>: I don't know how to give you a VIP badge. I was gonna give you VIP.

02:31:40
okufa_f: ENV FOO=bar in your Dockerfile

02:31:42
<transcript>: But I don't see how I can do that.

02:31:44
<transcript>: Hey, mods, why don't we be on.

02:31:44
<transcript>: because that was very

02:31:45
coolpantstv: actually Adam doesn't even confetti on new followers

02:31:47
<transcript>: Because that was very kind thing that you just said.

02:31:47

<transcript>: Oh, I just do it in my Docker file.

02:31:54
stiefbroerikzitvast: yea give him VIP for repeating what i said

02:31:58
<transcript>: Actually, Adam doesn't even confetti on new followers. It's true.

02:31:58
<transcript>: dax does that

<transcript>: Dax does that.

02:31:59
cowfacedude99: https://www.doppler.com/integrations/docker

02:31:59
lesabotsy: what's the name of the font used?

02:32:03
<transcript>: Give a vip for repeating what you said Zara.

02:32:03
<transcript>: welcome

02:32:09
mhuggins7278: but then it will be baked into the image

02:32:09
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. What's the name of the font? Its operator, mono. Thank you for the follow by the way to Rad.

02:32:10
okufa_f: im guessing it's operator mono

02:32:18
charafmrah: I came here from your Twitter

02:32:18
<transcript>: Dev rand div. And I'm not Marco. I don't know if I saw that one in krin tuza. I got very busy with this Docker stuff.

02:32:18
<transcript>: i'm guessing

02:32:20
<transcript>: I'm guessing it's operamarily.

02:32:20
<transcript>: baked in the image

02:32:29
<transcript>: Baked in the image. I don't need a baked in the image. I just need I need to build a passenger for this one time it'll be working when it's deployed. I just need to Bake it in right now. One day.

02:32:32
cowfacedude99: I throw doppler at anyone and everyone.

02:32:33
tayloreddev: docker run --env VAR=value

02:32:36
<transcript>: Like if I just say the environment variable, if I just say discord secret air, and like, that, can I just do it like that.

02:32:39
thdxr: it's working just deploy it

02:32:39
<transcript>: That won't work, that won't work, that won't work.

02:32:42
lesabotsy: Thnks :)

02:32:43
<transcript>: I need to say.

02:32:43
<transcript>: if working

02:32:46
<transcript>: If working, just deploy, you think it's just gonna work.

02:32:50
<transcript>: Dax, that's kind of risky. Let's just try.

02:32:50
<transcript>: run deploy

02:32:50
thdxr: just had to test that it started

02:32:52
sockthedev: adam, didn't you fix your follower notications?

02:32:53
<transcript>: Run, deploy. Let's just try deploying it. Why not.

02:32:57
<transcript>: What? Oh, I'm in the wrong directory. Puppy.

02:32:58
sockthedev: ah yeah

02:33:02
sockthedev: just saw it

02:33:07
<transcript>: Didn't you fix your father notifications? I did. Did it not work? Obito. Thank you for the follow and less U. Thank you for the follows.

02:33:08
mhuggins7278: --env MYVAR2=foo

02:33:14
mecoupz: are you even a real dev if you dont test on prod?

02:33:15
<transcript>: Just had to test that. It started. Okay, cool. Well, it built it built the thing. Let's see if it actually works.

02:33:25
<transcript>: Are you even a real dev? If you don't test on products, a good call. We're gonna assess some prod on this stream. If I do anything, it's tested on prod.

02:33:29
<transcript>: Oh, my goodness, I can't believe I'm still working on this.

02:33:32
<transcript>: What am I doing.

02:33:39
<transcript>: Oh, this is supposed to be just a dumb little thing I did at the very beginning. And then here we are still doing it.

02:33:41
<transcript>: Did anybody vip chart.

02:33:41
<transcript>: for repeating

02:33:43
<transcript>: For repeating what step, Row said.

02:33:43
<transcript>: anybody

02:33:45
<transcript>: Anybody I don't know how to be ideal.

02:33:47
uberrick: docker run -it -p <port>:<port> <image-id> would be to run locally anyway

02:33:49
<transcript>: I just don't know how.

02:33:50
cowfacedude99: what did I tell you? LUL

02:34:00

<transcript>: There you go.

02:34:03
<transcript>: very

02:34:05

neochromer: @charafmrah congratz

02:34:15
raadotdev: I totally did not copied your username idea :)

02:34:16

<transcript>: That sounds so awful.

02:34:20
charafmrah: Thanks lol

02:34:30
<transcript>: Socketed up. It's very validating for my own side project work to see your struggles. I'm glad. I'm glad. I'm glad that this is encouraging to somebody because it makes me depressed.

<transcript>: Everyone. Apparently, everyone knew that but me. I've used the Mac for, like, a decade. Everyone knew that you could just do that. And I had no idea. I think my cap up might be better than the original. I think the quality of the emote is better.

02:45:54
<transcript>: it's a little higher

02:45:56
<transcript>: It's a little higher deaf or something.

02:46:01
ghostyx101: kappa

lukeyfam15: adamdo8DealWithIt

02:47:02
<transcript>: Did you use Google Cloud before.

02:47:20
<transcript>: In firebase. No, I've never used firebase. So I did. I've used Google Cloud before. I've used gcp for mostly like their ml stuff. They've got really good vision libraries and their speech since this Stuff's really good wave. Net. So I've used some of that stuff. But I don't use Google Cloud for just like General compute stuff.

02:47:20

02:47:42
<transcript>: And a Tobis is way better with service stuff. That's the right answer. Sorry, dax, I'm awful at this.

02:47:46
<transcript>: Aws is better at serverless. That's why I care.

02:47:47
thdxr: yeah wtf

<transcript>: Anyways is better at running easy two instances because they have elastic Beanstock.

02:47:57

02:47:59

02:48:02
<transcript>: I love to set up my elastic Beanstock instances on SST.

02:48:02

<transcript>: It's so great.

02:48:16
uberrick: dax is just here to baby sit for the whole stream xD

02:48:18
<transcript>: Adam likes aws only because he's the only one who knows the ui and does it get confused by it? I try not to use dui too much, but I have used it enough that I don't get too much confused by it. Did you look at App runner? What is appren or duplic? I've heard of it.

02:48:18
<transcript>: does it just run

02:48:27
cowfacedude99: I don't know if you are kidding or not LUL

02:48:30
<transcript>: Does it just run if I just have some type script and I want to run it long term. Aws app runner how is this thing still deploying? I feel like there's a bug or something's broken and it doesn't know yet.

02:48:30
thdxr: I need to get paid for this

02:48:34
<transcript>: You don't know if I'm kidding or not. Cafes.

02:48:34

02:48:49
mecoupz: adam doesnt pay you day? bro

<transcript>: Container's Web Applications api's at Scale so it's not a web application.

02:50:02
<transcript>: does that matter

02:50:05
<transcript>: Does that matter if it's just like a thing that's running all the time.

02:50:07
coolpantstv: my hourly rate is 3 larabars

02:50:10
<transcript>: App Runner has cdk stuff you think you don't think it does.

02:50:33
grasp5533: Oh we are on to app runner now?

02:50:34
<transcript>: This is just how technology goes. You know, you always think you're getting something fast and never go fast. I can't believe it's still doing this. What is it doing? Actually, right now.

02:51:21
<transcript>: you're probably

02:51:27
<transcript>: You're probably a better way to do this, isn't there? Like, create a repo faster. Like from the cli. I don't care. I'm doing this.

03:03:27

03:03:27
thdxr: ask statmuse

03:03:31

<transcript>: Like we've got a pretty good presence.

03:03:46
<transcript>: on

03:03:56
<transcript>: the technology

03:03:59
<transcript>: The technology. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what it's worth.

03:03:59
<transcript>: but in terms

03:04:08
<transcript>: But in terms of revenue, I think we're gonna do okay, once we turn on some of the subscription stuff we're working on right now. Well, that I'm supposed to be working right now, that I'm not working on because I'm doing this stupid thing.

03:04:08

<transcript>: I knew Adam. It reinvent. But he didn't know me. That's right, Alan. But by the end of it, I knew you. You know, I knew you, Alan. Why not try running locally again? See if it works.

<transcript>: On the instance. It shouldn't be the issue.

03:05:02
<transcript>: i don't think

<transcript>: Search Engines Perplexity perplexity.

03:06:10
<transcript>: There's these new search engines. Like who has the most touchdown.

03:06:10
<transcript>: passes

03:06:19
<transcript>: Passes in a season and these things use status like they reference us so you can see here we're one of the references for this answer.

03:06:37
<transcript>: So one thing that's on our radar is like, is this the world of traditional seo. And like how search engines always worked before. Is that changing fundamental, like, are things like this gonna eat Google? Because we get like half a million visitors from Google every day. Just Google organic searches.

03:06:37
<transcript>: so if that

03:06:45
<transcript>: So if that changes, we need to know about it, and we need to be staying on top of it. I think it'll work in our favor. If the more.

03:06:45
<transcript>: search

03:06:47
<transcript>: Search on the internet.

03:06:47
<transcript>: turn

03:06:47
vapor__dev: the camera zoom MaxLOL

03:07:00
<transcript>: Turns into natural language searching the better suited we should be. I'm not gonna say AI couldn't just wipe this out, but the current tech is not going to give you the kind of answers that savvys can give you, like when you go to Samus.com and you want to know.

03:07:02
<transcript>: How many.

03:07:02
<transcript>: pass

03:07:06
<transcript>: Passing yards? Did my homes have.

03:07:10
<transcript>: In looks.

03:07:11
vapor__dev: "we need to know about it" => scared face => camera zoom. honestly the production value here is incredible

03:07:19
<transcript>: These kind of questions. What does AI do with this? I'm not sure, but like we we give you some stuff. We even give you Pat my homes saying the answer.

03:07:22
<transcript>: It sounds awful.

03:07:28
<transcript>: Oh, that sounds bad. But pana Holmes actually says it in his voice.

03:07:30
<transcript>: We need to know about.

03:07:39
vapor__dev: yeah it was perfect

03:07:39
<transcript>: The production value here is incredible. Oh, did it actually Zoom in on my face at a good time? Sometimes it does. Mostly not good times. Mostly zooms in on my face.

03:07:39
<transcript>: at very

03:07:44
<transcript>: At very anopportune times like when I cover my mouth with.

03:07:44
<transcript>: a drink

03:07:46
<transcript>: A drink? It'll Zoom in on my face.

03:07:48
vapor__dev: you were like "we need to know!" => zoom in

03:07:49
<transcript>: Is it doing it.

03:07:55
<transcript>: Oh, I did it.

03:07:55
<transcript>: see like

03:07:59
<transcript>: See, like I'm not making a weird face. I just have a coffee cup in my face.

03:08:03
<transcript>: I don't know, but it's supposed to Zoom and I do stuff like this.

03:08:05
gabrielmodog: the avatar are gen by an AI?

03:08:13
gabrielmodog: or made by hand?

03:08:15
<transcript>: And it does. It just does a lot of false positive. If we could get rid of the false positives, that would be nice. Someone worked on that for me. It's in my dot files.

03:08:18
vapor__dev: nice hero mug

03:08:20
adamdotdev: !players

03:08:20
fossabot: The player illustrations on statmuse.com are illustrated by the magnificent Michael Walchalk (https://www.michaelwalchalkdesign.com/).

03:08:30
<transcript>: The avatar generated by AI know they are. They are illustrated by Michael Waltzock. You know what? I asked Michael Walshock if you want to come on the stream and illustrate some players live for you. All for you. Fine folks.

03:08:30
<transcript>: like maybe you

03:08:33
<transcript>: Like maybe you want to watch him illustrate some players.

03:08:37
<transcript>: He was not super excited about it.

03:08:42
<transcript>: He said you likes to keep the mystery around how his work is done.

03:08:42
<transcript>: which

03:08:46
<transcript>: Which means he's probably just outsourcing it all the AI. I'm just kidding.

03:08:46
<transcript>: no

03:08:52
<transcript>: No wall talks the best he might come on and do it. He's gonna think about it hardshicks. Then things would follow.

03:08:52
<transcript>: okay

03:08:56
vapor__dev: i want him to do my avatar

03:08:57
mecoupz: he's probably just using AI tools :D

03:08:59
<transcript>: Okay. Do we give up yet? Do we give up yet? Should we just let dax just finish this project for us.

03:08:59
<transcript>: let's just

03:09:00
gabrielmodog: don't be shy Michael

03:09:00
thdxr: remember when you tried to destroy him using AI

03:09:02
<transcript>: Let's just let dax finish this project.

03:09:02
<transcript>: it's gonna dax

03:09:03
<transcript>: It's gonna dax, something to do.

03:09:03
<transcript>: remember

03:09:04
harshxdev: HeyGuys

03:09:05
<transcript>: Remember.

03:09:07
tayloreddev: outsourcing

03:09:07
thdxr: I'll do it

03:09:11
<transcript>: That's funny. Okay.

03:09:22
<transcript>: No, he's been doing it for eight years. He's worked at Statmes for, like, eight years. So back then, you couldn't just generate images with AI. He doesn't by hand. I've watched him do some. In fact.

03:09:22
<transcript>: he used to

03:09:34
<transcript>: He used to. He had one. I think we needed Wayne Gretzkies. He made a little, like, time lapse of it and like screen share time lapse of the whole illustration. But I think I get, like keeping a little mystery around the process.

03:09:34
<transcript>: like

03:09:44
<transcript>: Like he's a mysterious guy. Anyway, we'll see he also said it's just probably super boring because it takes hours and it's like illustrator just moving lines around and stuff.

03:09:49
cowfacedude99: this is going to be an hour long project.... LUL

03:09:51
impostorengineer: did he draw you at all?

03:09:54
thdxr: idk people wathced you for hours struggling with this

03:09:54
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Harsh dev. Okay, dax, you're gonna do the rest. I'm just gonna stop what I'm doing on this project because I hate it. And I never want to touch it again. I'm just gonna cancel that.

03:09:54
<transcript>: i'm gonna say

03:09:59
<transcript>: I'm gonna say get status. I'm gonna post the latest because I don't know. I probably did something.

03:10:01
<transcript>: Latest.

03:10:01
<transcript>: push it

03:10:08
thdxr: they might watch him

03:10:11
<transcript>: Push it, and dax is gonna get this working. I don't know where we want to put it. I was running it in my personal account. Dax, if it costs money, I'm happy to put it in my account. I got a lot of credit.

03:10:17
<transcript>: I don't know. People watched you for hours struggling with this. They might watch him. That's true.

03:10:20
<transcript>: It'd be more exciting than this.

03:10:20
<transcript>: okay

03:10:24
<transcript>: Okay, we're done. We're done with this project. Let's move on to Sat, museums.

03:10:24
<transcript>: com

03:10:26
<transcript>: Com.

03:10:26
<transcript>: status

03:10:30
<transcript>: Status. Here we go. We're just jumping straight into it.

03:10:36
<transcript>: We're gonna go into the tab component. We gotta fix this thing.

03:10:36
<transcript>: we're gonna

03:10:39
<transcript>: We're gonna open up the game.

03:10:42
<transcript>: We're gonna open up.

03:10:45
<transcript>: Mba Box Score okay.

03:10:48
<transcript>: So our tab component. We got to figure this out.

03:10:48
<transcript>: i remember

03:10:51
<transcript>: I remember now. The struggles of yesterday.

03:10:51
<transcript>: or two days

03:10:53
<transcript>: Or two days ago.

03:10:57
<transcript>: This is a problem. It's a problem.

03:11:01
<transcript>: It's also a problem that I think I have to pee.

03:11:08
<transcript>: I think I have to pee and I think I should probably go ahead and do that before I contact switch.

03:11:08
<transcript>: so here

03:11:09
gabrielmodog: you should

03:11:16
<transcript>: So here's our problem. We're trying to make a tab component. We gotta make this thing the full width. We'll figure it out right after IP.

03:11:19
<transcript>: I'll be right back.

03:11:40
vapor__dev: this is nice hacking music

03:11:44
harshxdev: Boxer shorts gang😎🤙🏻

03:11:44
elliot0x01: This man's stream is on next level

03:11:49
elliot0x01: Multi cam setup :)

03:11:58
vapor__dev: when we getting a bathroom cam

03:12:06
ghostyx101: dont be a creep

03:12:23
mono_nz: just hope the mute button is working again :P

03:13:03
elliot0x01: I need a setup like this LOL, simple, clean and minimal :)

03:14:11
kantong1: music reminds me of ssx tricky

03:14:53
elliot0x01: Damnn these stream decks are expensive :|

03:15:07
thdxr: I'm buying one rn

03:16:19
<transcript>: On my phone call.

03:16:26
<transcript>: You guys heard like Adam talks. The person who doesn't know.

03:16:26
<transcript>: adam

03:16:28
<transcript>: Adam. That person.

03:16:28
thdxr: we heard you say "I'm working"

03:16:32
<transcript>: I'm very polite.

03:16:39
<transcript>: So I remember something I want to do we heard you say I'm working.

03:16:42
<transcript>: That was the lie.

03:16:42
<transcript>: el

03:16:45
<transcript>: El bandito. Thank you for the follow.

03:16:56
<transcript>: Something I want to do.

03:17:00
<transcript>: It's related to Sat muse, and we're gonna do it now.

03:17:03
<transcript>: Here we go.

03:17:12
<transcript>: So Stapmes and gpt four.

03:17:12
<transcript>: here

03:17:13
<transcript>: Here's what I want to know.

03:17:13
<transcript>: i don't know

03:17:17
<transcript>: I don't know given a screenshot like this one.

03:17:19
<transcript>: Okay.

03:17:24
<transcript>: A. Screenshot.

03:17:27
<transcript>: I need to Zoom out.

03:17:35
<transcript>: So let's delete. I'm gonna just delete this.

03:17:38
<transcript>: No.

03:17:41
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:17:44
<transcript>: There's this whole thing.

03:17:49
<transcript>: Okay, now given this.

03:17:49
<transcript>: so i

03:17:51
<transcript>: So I know this looks awful.

03:17:51
<transcript>: like this

03:17:54
<transcript>: Like, this is bad. Visually. I know this is bad.

03:17:54
<transcript>: so i

03:17:57
<transcript>: So I take a screenshot of it.

03:17:57
phdhorrible: Is this the lip smacking ASMR section of Twitch?

03:18:09
<transcript>: So magic you're developed and you don't have a good design sense. I think I have a pretty good design since for being a developer, I know this is bad, but not a developer would know this is bad.

03:18:09
<transcript>: i'm gonna take

03:18:16
<transcript>: I'm gonna take a screenshot of it. I'm going to chat gdpt and I'm gonna also do this. I'm gonna take the Dom.

03:18:16
<transcript>: like

03:18:18
<transcript>: Like the whole body. Maybe.

03:18:20
<transcript>: Okay.

03:18:20
<transcript>: and

03:18:24
<transcript>: And I'm gonna say, let's go to Chat, gpt, let's say.

03:18:27
<transcript>: New chat.

03:18:30
<transcript>: We're gonna use gpt four because we can paste images in here.

03:18:34
<transcript>: I think I can paste images in here.

03:18:34
<transcript>: do i just

03:18:36
<transcript>: Do I just drag it in.

03:18:36
<transcript>: so

03:18:39
<transcript>: So I just drag it.

03:18:39
<transcript>: i don't know why i

03:18:40
<transcript>: I don't know why I said.

03:18:40
<transcript>: drag it

03:18:41
<transcript>: Drag it.

03:18:44
thdxr: you can paste images?

03:18:45
<transcript>: This is the lip smacking ASMR yes, that's right.

03:18:46
actuallydoc: wow thats insane..

03:18:49
<transcript>: So if I drop this in.

03:18:52
<transcript>: No, that doesn't work. How do I add images.

03:18:56
<transcript>: How do I add images.

03:18:58
overra_dev: it doesn't support images yet

03:19:02
thdxr: I think only the api does images

03:19:02
<transcript>: Images.

03:19:02
<transcript>: it doesn't support

03:19:03
thdxr: not chat

03:19:04
typosrry: it only works through API

03:19:05
<transcript>: It doesn't support images yet. Oh, no.

03:19:08
elliot0x01: Doesn't support

03:19:08
<transcript>: Only the api, not Chat, no.

03:19:11
iannery: ask it

03:19:11
<transcript>: Bomber.

03:19:15
<transcript>: Okay. Well, fine.

03:19:15
<transcript>: what i thought

03:19:16
thdxr: describe the image to it in text

03:19:26
<transcript>: What I thought was I could drop the markup, which has all my styling. It is tailwind and a screenshot and be like, Please, could you help me make this more visually appealing and then see if it would give me like.

03:19:26
<transcript>: changes to the

03:19:28
dmmulroy: You might be able to get similar results with it just inspecting the markup

03:19:29
<transcript>: Changes to the markup to make it more visually appealing. How cool would that be.

03:19:31
<transcript>: That would be pretty cool.

03:19:37
<transcript>: Describe the image to it in text. Let's see if I can just paste the whole domin. Let's do this.

03:19:37
<transcript>: i'm going

03:19:39
<transcript>: I'm going to paste.

03:19:43
thdxr: it's too long

03:19:44
<transcript>: An html page styled with tailwind.

03:19:46
thdxr: there's a limit

03:19:51
<transcript>: And I want you to suggest.

03:19:53
<transcript>: Some changes to the.

03:19:55
dmmulroy: gpt4 got that chonky limit

03:19:58
<transcript>: Filing that would make it.

03:19:58
<transcript>: more

03:20:01
<transcript>: More visually.

03:20:03
<transcript>: Appealing.

03:20:05
<transcript>: And user friendly.

03:20:11
<transcript>: There it is.

03:20:13
<transcript>: Too long. Okay.

03:20:13
<transcript>: that's

03:20:15
<transcript>: That's too much markup.

03:20:16
structuredchris: reponds with "delete everything"

03:20:17
<transcript>: Good to know.

03:20:17
<transcript>: i thought you could

03:20:21
<transcript>: I thought you could do like 320 or something. I could delete the.

03:20:21
<transcript>: comment it out

03:20:23
<transcript>: Comment it out, thing.

03:20:28
<transcript>: Wow, it's got a big long svg in there. That's pretty rough.

03:20:32
elliot0x01: You can give it a gist link

03:20:34
<transcript>: Okay idea squashed. I don't care what's actually do some work.

03:20:39
elliot0x01: paste the code in a gist

03:20:42
<transcript>: Too long. There's a limit. Dvd. Four. Got that chunky limit. Yeah, it's supposed to be a much bigger limit. I thought that would be fine, but.

03:20:42
<transcript>: you

03:20:44
typosrry: ChatGPT UI still has the limit of 4k tokens, the API will do 8k and 32k

03:20:46
<transcript>: You can give it a gist link that works. Are you kidding me.

03:20:51
elliot0x01: or you can divide the code into code blocks

03:20:55
<transcript>: Oh, the api will do eight and 32, but the ui has a 4k limit. Okay, that's good to know.

03:21:03
<transcript>: Divide the code into code block. Are you sure you can? You can actually paste a gist link and that works. I didn't know it could fetch stuff from links.

03:21:08
elliot0x01: yes

03:21:08
overra_dev: It doesn't have access to the internet

03:21:15
<transcript>: Yeah. I didn't think it had access to the internet.

03:21:24
overra_dev: it will hallucinate as if it does tho

03:21:27
<transcript>: Okay.

03:21:27
iannery: might as well give it a try

03:21:42
<transcript>: We're gonna just move on.

03:21:42
<transcript>: probably

03:21:44
<transcript>: Probably 45 minutes.

03:21:47
<transcript>: In this. Html.

03:21:47
elliot0x01: I have tried with gist and it worked

03:21:50
<transcript>: Only tab control is gonna be the detamee.

03:21:53
<transcript>: So what we need to do.

03:22:00
<transcript>: Is separate them into dom. I don't know how to do that, though.

03:22:03
<transcript>: I don't know the way to do this.

03:22:05
elliot0x01: Funny thing is, ChatGPT itself asked me to paste the code in a gist and share

03:22:06
mecoupz: are u still trying to do that with plain css?

03:22:13
<transcript>: Yummy coops.

03:22:16
<transcript>: Still trying to do it with CSS.

03:22:28
<transcript>: The problem we have.

03:22:28
thdxr: wait it'll download a gist???

03:22:31
<transcript>: Is difficult for me to communicate.

03:22:32
thdxr: wtf

03:22:37
<transcript>: Test that. Dax. I'd love to know.

03:22:37
<transcript>: if it actually

03:22:39
<transcript>: If it actually works.

03:22:43
<transcript>: Not public app. Things are much with volo.

03:22:46
<transcript>: So.

03:22:52
thdxr: then you can make it visit arbitrary urls if that's true...

03:22:52
<transcript>: I use an css only.

03:22:52
<transcript>: solution

03:22:53
<transcript>: Solution.

03:22:56
<transcript>: Where.

03:22:56
<transcript>: uses

03:23:00
<transcript>: Uses peer checked on this hidden radio input right.

03:23:00
<transcript>: this hidden

03:23:02
<transcript>: This hidden radio input.

03:23:06
<transcript>: And then we hide the div, which has the content.

03:23:12
<transcript>: And only show it when the tab? When the radio is tabbed? I'm sorry. Checked. Okay.

03:23:15
cowfacedude99: did you ask the gpt?

03:23:17
<transcript>: So.

03:23:19
<transcript>: That's what we're trying to do.

03:23:24
<transcript>: Did you ask the GPT.

03:23:24
<transcript>: oh

03:23:27
<transcript>: Oh, ask it if it can do.

03:23:27
<transcript>: we can

03:23:29
<transcript>: We can read gists.

03:23:29
elliot0x01: No I guess it has limited access maybe to some particular hostnames ?

03:23:29
thdxr: As an AI language model, I am unable to directly access external resources like GitHub Gists or download files.

03:23:36
<transcript>: Unable to directly access. Okay.

03:23:38
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow Sheppo.

03:23:41
<transcript>: Okay. So.

03:23:45
<transcript>: The problem I have is.

03:23:50
<transcript>: These divs that have the content in them.

03:23:55
<transcript>: They.

03:23:55
<transcript>: live

03:23:57
<transcript>: Live inside this container.

03:23:59
<transcript>: Can I separate that.

03:23:59
cowfacedude99: no. ask if the gpt can do hidden tabs.

03:24:03
<transcript>: I just not put a container around them.

03:24:09
<transcript>: In an astro component. Expose multiple top level control. Can you do this.

03:24:09
<transcript>: this works

03:24:10
<transcript>: This works.

03:24:15
<transcript>: And I might be able to make it work.

03:24:15
<transcript>: okay so

03:24:19
cowfacedude99: I think it can be done with aria tag...

03:24:19
<transcript>: Okay, so what does that do that's flexing each of the individual controls.

03:24:23
<transcript>: Don't want that. But now this one could be absolute.

03:24:30
<transcript>: And then if the top thing were relative.

03:24:33
<transcript>: Let's see the box for we got the box for.

03:24:35
elliot0x01: Yes, I can read a code block from a Gist if you share the URL with me. However, I won't be able to execute or modify the code as I'm a language model and not a programming environment. If you provide me with the URL, I can parse the code block and provide you with a text representation of the code.

03:24:37
<transcript>: The cba Box for.

03:24:40
<transcript>: This box. Where.

03:24:46
<transcript>: So if this tab.

03:24:46
<transcript>: let's see now if

03:24:47
<transcript>: Let's see now, if this one right here.

03:24:52
<transcript>: Would be relative.

03:24:55
<transcript>: Right.

03:24:55
<transcript>: nope

03:24:57
<transcript>: Nope. That's not doing it.

03:25:00
<transcript>: What'd that do.

03:25:06
<transcript>: What did that do.

03:25:11
<transcript>: There's a tab? There's a tab.

03:25:14
<transcript>: This is relative.

03:25:14
<transcript>: the tab

03:25:16
<transcript>: The tab.

03:25:20
<transcript>: Then doesn't have a top level container.

03:25:24
<transcript>: What's the problem here.

03:25:36
<transcript>: We also lost the top part altogether. That part.

03:25:38
<transcript>: Wait.

03:25:45
<transcript>: Here's the radio. Let's see.

03:25:48
overra_dev: I use Bing Chat when GPT's dataset is too old (Sept 21), for example asking it to explain Drizzle ORM to GPT-4, then copy the explanation to GPT-4 so that it has some context. It wouldn't have any reference to it's documentation though

03:25:50
<transcript>: So they're all just kind of dumped in here. Now this might work.

03:25:50
<transcript>: so they're all

03:25:56
<transcript>: So they're all dumped in here. That radio is hidden. I need to put a wrapper around. Let's see, let's see, let's see.

03:26:03
<transcript>: I need to put a wrap around this.

03:26:07
<transcript>: I can't do that.

03:26:16
thdxr: what is drizzle?

03:26:19
<transcript>: An error tag.

03:26:23
<transcript>: Oh ask if gbt can do hidden tabs.

03:26:27
<transcript>: What do you mean by hidden tabs.

03:26:33
<transcript>: I would like to communicate my problem so that someone might be able to help me.

03:26:33
<transcript>: let me see

03:26:35
<transcript>: Let me see if I can.

03:26:41
<transcript>: So.

03:27:00
<transcript>: We're using the css only approach, but we also need it's also just kind of like a component structure issue. Like, I don't know how to structure a component that's like a tab control. So if this were the this is an individual tab.

03:27:02
overra_dev: potential replacement for prisma with db schema written in typescript instead of a custom SDL

03:27:10
<transcript>: Imagine if this component where the whole tab control. What do I want the props to look like? How do I pass in props to a tabs control? I want you to look at prior art.

03:27:16
<transcript>: Let's look at like react tabs control. What how do they pass in.

03:27:18
<transcript>: How does material UI do it.

03:27:18
<transcript>: what are the

03:27:22
<transcript>: What are the props look like? So here we go. You have a box.

03:27:28
<transcript>: Tabs. And then you have individual tab components inside of it. Okay.

03:27:32
<transcript>: And then you have the Tab panels down here.

03:27:32
<transcript>: yeah

03:27:33
thdxr: oh is it what this video is about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tl9XCiQErA

03:27:36
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. So a tab panel is a different thing.

03:27:39
<transcript>: A different thing, right.

03:27:40
overra_dev: dsl*

03:27:44
<transcript>: Okay. That's probably the way I should do it roughly.

03:27:46
<transcript>: Probably.

03:27:49
overra_dev: lol

03:27:55
thdxr: gottem

03:27:55
<transcript>: Plug.

03:27:57
<transcript>: Ice plug there.

03:27:57
<transcript>: so we're gonna

03:27:59
overra_dev: yes i think i heard from it you first

03:28:03
<transcript>: So we're gonna have a tab and a tab component. Tab. Astro.

03:28:04
overra_dev: lol

03:28:07
<transcript>: Okay.

03:28:15
<transcript>: And tabs is going to do what.

03:28:18
<transcript>: Tabs is gonna be the.

03:28:18
<transcript>: it's gonna

03:28:24
<transcript>: It's gonna it's gonna hold the tab components. So I guess it's just a slot.

03:28:27
<transcript>: Just a slot.

03:28:27
<transcript>: and then whatever

03:28:32
<transcript>: And then whatever at the top level that we need, which I think is just flax.

03:28:39
<transcript>: Okay. There's no label on tab.

03:28:44
<transcript>: So no input.

03:28:44
<transcript>: it's

03:28:46
<transcript>: It's a div.

03:28:50
<transcript>: And then I could like, add all the props here.

03:28:56
<transcript>: Astro. Props. Can I do that.

03:28:56
<transcript>: is that a pattern

03:28:58
<transcript>: Is that a pattern in astro? I guess so.

03:28:58
<transcript>: okay

03:29:00
<transcript>: Okay.

03:29:04
<transcript>: So I don't know what this component is giving us right now.

03:29:05
overra_dev: i like you dax

03:29:08
<transcript>: But let's just say let's just humor me.

03:29:08
<transcript>: on the

03:29:14
<transcript>: On the mba box for let's say now we're gonna have here tabs component.

03:29:17
<transcript>: Tabs.

03:29:20
<transcript>: Right.

03:29:28
<transcript>: We put both these tabs in there.

03:29:34
<transcript>: I know they change the spelling.

03:29:34
<transcript>: i think

03:29:37
<transcript>: I think for the follow narc.

03:29:38
<transcript>: narca

03:29:39
<transcript>: Narca.

03:29:45
elliot0x01: How does this multi cam setup transition so smoothly ?

03:29:50
<transcript>: Also things follow good grandpa.

03:29:51
elliot0x01: I love it

03:29:52
<transcript>: I like you. Dax.

03:29:55
thdxr: his wife is running around with the camera behind him

03:29:56
goodgrandpaa: you got it!

03:29:57
<transcript>: See Adam, how does this multicam setup transitions so smoothly.

03:29:57
<transcript>: lots

03:30:01
<transcript>: Lots of effort. I put a lot of time into the into the.

03:30:03
overra_dev: rofl

03:30:05
<transcript>: Overlay app that runs all my cameras and stuff.

03:30:05
<transcript>: welcome to

03:30:09
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Good grandpa, welcome, welcome.

03:30:13
goodgrandpaa: thank you! :)

03:30:14
<transcript>: Life is running around the camera behind him. That's funny. That's pretty funny.

03:30:22
<transcript>: My wife would do that if I asked her to. But I'm not gonna ask her to. No, she wouldn't. She would not do that.

03:30:27
<transcript>: Nobody would do that. Because that would be done.

03:30:31
<transcript>: Okay tab has individual tab components.

03:30:31
<transcript>: we're gonna just

03:30:37
<transcript>: We're gonna just remove this one. But first I'm gonna yank all that because I think.

03:30:37
<transcript>: no i guess

03:30:42
<transcript>: No, I guess I don't need let's see. Just. I could just do this. Clarity.

03:30:46
<transcript>: Top six, and then I can delete this one.

03:30:48
<transcript>: And this one.

03:30:52
<transcript>: Now if we go back to our tabs component.

03:30:57
<transcript>: I need to I need to do something a little special here with class.

03:30:57
<transcript>: so

03:30:58
<transcript>: So a class list.

03:31:01
<transcript>: And we need to do flex.

03:31:10
<transcript>: We need to do like this Astro.

03:31:10
<transcript>: astrops

03:31:13
<transcript>: Astrops class, right. And then.

03:31:18
<transcript>: Follow guido Carta, Carta.

03:31:24
<transcript>: And then go back here.

03:31:32
<transcript>: Okay. So we put the props first and then we overwrite class with that. Think of the follow Mr. Glaze.

03:31:35
<transcript>: All the follows. I appreciate your follows.

03:31:35
<transcript>: okay

03:31:36
<transcript>: Okay.

03:31:36
<transcript>: let's see

03:31:38
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:31:38
<transcript>: so that's

03:31:44
<transcript>: So that's that's our tabs component. I don't really. It's just a div. I don't really know why I even have a tab component.

03:31:44
<transcript>: but maybe

03:31:49
<transcript>: But maybe we're gonna need it here in a second. Maybe it'll make sense. So if a tab.

03:31:49
<transcript>: tabs

03:31:56
<transcript>: Tabs component has individual tab components in it. Then we need to have tab panel.

03:31:59
<transcript>: How did they do it.

03:32:07
<transcript>: They have tabs value on change. Okay so this has like the events and the initial value on it.

03:32:15
<transcript>: And it probably like looks at its children somehow. That's the one thing I don't know how to do. An astros, like, inspect the children components.

03:32:17
mecoupz: adam did you tried it achieve what you want with plain css and tags without moving parts out to a component? haven't seen the tuesday stream fully

03:32:18
<transcript>: They get slotted in.

03:32:30
<transcript>: Yeah, me coops. Now, did you try and achieve what you want with plain css and Tags without moving parts out to a component.

03:32:47
<transcript>: Like without componentizing it. I did not try fully. No, I did not try doing it with just. Yes, sir. I know it can be done. Like I know how to do it in css now, but I did not actually go through the exercise of doing it without a component. Like, I'm trying to just create the components.

03:32:50
<transcript>: Tab panel.

03:32:50
<transcript>: tab

03:32:52
<transcript>: Tab panel.

03:32:52
<transcript>: those

03:32:56
<transcript>: Those are gonna be listed below, and then I can style them separately.

03:32:56
<transcript>: right

03:32:58
<transcript>: Right.

03:33:03
<transcript>: So I think the tab is gonna have its own container around the actual tab.

03:33:03
<transcript>: click

03:33:05
<transcript>: Clickable part.

03:33:10
<transcript>: Okay. So then we have Tab panel.

03:33:24
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:33:31
<transcript>: Feels weird to have this in Components Tab Panel the boxing.

03:33:36
<transcript>: Astro fto is not the right. It's not the right name.

03:33:38
<transcript>: This Astro.

03:33:42
<transcript>: Okay, tap panel.

03:33:51
<transcript>: This is three different components. Just the render tab. I hate it.

03:33:55
<transcript>: So what's this one gonna do? This one's gonna have.

03:34:02
<transcript>: Same thing. It does very little. It's just a little container. It's not gonna have flex on it.

03:34:02
<transcript>: in fact

03:34:06
<transcript>: In fact this whole class list can just go away.

03:34:12
<transcript>: Thanks. Thank you for the follow. Sapphire.

03:34:21
<transcript>: Think this is all it is. It's just a glorified Div for now and then we have a home for it when we need to do something special.

03:34:26
<transcript>: Okay tab panel. And this one is going to.

03:34:31
<transcript>: This one's going to.

03:34:33
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:34:33
<transcript>: thank you

03:34:35
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow.

03:34:38
<transcript>: Three int. Three.

03:34:40
<transcript>: 9th.

03:34:43
<transcript>: Let's just delete and tag. Nope.

03:34:50
<transcript>: Like that? Nope. I want to delete everything in here.

03:34:58
<transcript>: There we go. And then paste it in here. Okay. So here's our tab panel. It's our first tab panel. And I guess do I need to.

03:34:58
<transcript>: just like

03:35:02
<transcript>: Just like the index of these will just work. Maybe ooh I don't know.

03:35:08
<transcript>: But let's just say we have this markup right now. It's probably doing weird things.

03:35:11
<transcript>: Oh, not terribly weird.

03:35:14
<transcript>: Wait a minute.

03:35:14
<transcript>: it's actually working

03:35:16
<transcript>: It's actually working out. No.

03:35:20
<transcript>: Okay. So we need to fix the tab control.

03:35:20
<transcript>: if we go to

03:35:22
<transcript>: If we go to the tab control.

03:35:27
<transcript>: This will no longer have a slot in it.

03:35:31
<transcript>: That is so loud.

03:35:31
<transcript>: this will no longer

03:35:33
<transcript>: This will no longer have this in it.

03:35:33
<transcript>: this

03:35:35
<transcript>: This actually.

03:35:35
<transcript>: this

03:35:36
<transcript>: This class.

03:35:40
<transcript>: That's gonna go in.

03:35:42
<transcript>: The.

03:35:42
<transcript>: tab panel

03:35:44
<transcript>: Tab. Panel. Right.

03:35:48
<transcript>: Oh no.

03:35:51
<transcript>: Well.

03:35:56
jobnbackpack: Lalallaalalala

03:36:02
<transcript>: We're gonna do this, tabs. We're gonna just yank this again.

03:36:05
<transcript>: Okay.

03:36:05
<transcript>: and instead

03:36:05
jobnbackpack: he's having fun!

03:36:08
<transcript>: And instead of flex, this one's gonna be some stuff.

03:36:10
<transcript>: And that stuff.

03:36:10
<transcript>: is coming

03:36:12
<transcript>: Is coming from here.

03:36:30
<transcript>: Hidden peer checked. Block bg, white. But that's not gonna be peer checked. It's gonna be a much more complicated selector. Okay.

03:36:33
<transcript>: Lala.

03:36:33
<transcript>: it's

03:36:35
<transcript>: It's having fun. I am having fun.

03:36:38
<transcript>: Job. I'm having so much fun.

03:36:49
<transcript>: Okay, so this selector is just gonna be hard. We're gonna figure it out, but it's gonna be the hard part. We're gonna have to pass something into associate this tab. Okay, I can delete this one.

03:36:49
<transcript>: so now

03:36:50
<transcript>: So now.

03:37:00
<transcript>: This is just gonna go in here, and then this has gone away.

03:37:08
<transcript>: A text center text light the primary pythree. Okay.

03:37:10
<transcript>: This is it.

03:37:13
<transcript>: This is.

03:37:15
<transcript>: It.

03:37:15
<transcript>: for the

03:37:23
<transcript>: For the ID. Okay, How's this work? How do I expose the ID? Okay, we're gonna have to pass the ID in.

03:37:23
<transcript>: so

03:37:26
<transcript>: So ID string it's also gonna be required.

03:37:28
<transcript>: Okay.

03:37:32
<transcript>: And the ids are gonna come from.

03:37:38
<transcript>: What are they gonna come from.

03:37:41
<transcript>: What are they going to come from.

03:37:44
<transcript>: Tabs can.

03:37:44
<transcript>: know how

03:37:46
<transcript>: Know how this would work.

03:37:53
<transcript>: If the let's say the tabs control somehow had awareness of every child in the slots. Let's see if I can figure that out. Astro.

03:37:58
<transcript>: Find children.

03:38:04
<transcript>: Of type and slot? I don't know oh, oh, here we go.

03:38:04
<transcript>: asking

03:38:13
<transcript>: Asking children to framework components. You can use name fossils with the child and look like they exist. Access the name slots using props. What.

03:38:17
<transcript>: So if I name the slot.

03:38:20
<transcript>: Can I name them dynamically.

03:38:24
<transcript>: These are not Framework components, though.

03:38:28
<transcript>: This is not a react sidebar. No.

03:38:29
<transcript>: Name.

03:38:29
<transcript>: specific

03:38:30
<transcript>: Specific.

03:38:40
<transcript>: Here's what it would look like. Apparently.

03:38:40
<transcript>: if i'm

03:38:42
<transcript>: If I'm thinking about this correctly.

03:38:45
<transcript>: Slot.

03:38:54
<transcript>: I think what it would look like is.

03:38:54
<transcript>: and here

03:38:57
<transcript>: And here we would have to say.

03:38:57
<transcript>: like this

03:38:59
<transcript>: Like this tab is a slot.

03:39:02
maleero: Does Astro use web components?

03:39:02
<transcript>: Oh, what's wrong? Oh, these have to have IDs.

03:39:17
<transcript>: This is going to feel really gross. But those have ids. And then here it would have, like, slot equals one.

03:39:20
<transcript>: Slot equals two.

03:39:20
<transcript>: is

03:39:23
<transcript>: Is this wrong? Does this feel bad.

03:39:27
<transcript>: Astro does not use web components. Maliro.

03:39:27
<transcript>: it

03:39:29
<transcript>: It does not.

03:39:34
<transcript>: So if we specify the slots like this.

03:39:37
<transcript>: And in our tabs component.

03:39:40
<transcript>: We could say.

03:39:40
<transcript>: what

03:39:42
<transcript>: What could we say.

03:39:44
<transcript>: Props.

03:39:50
<transcript>: Let's go, let's go up here. Project components.

03:39:54
<transcript>: Named name slot.

03:40:00
<transcript>: So then these have all the different names.

03:40:07
<transcript>: But did I see something about the name? The slot names would be on props.

03:40:32
<transcript>: Html. Html Web Component slot Slot So there is such a thing as a namel. Web component slot. Maybe it does use web components. I don't know.

03:40:49
<transcript>: So the problem I have. Do you all see the problem I have like, is everyone catching? Does anyone care? I don't know if you guys probably just working. You don't need my problems in your life.

03:40:51
<transcript>: But.

03:40:51
<transcript>: those who

03:40:53
<transcript>: Those who are watching and care.

03:40:56
<transcript>: The.

03:40:58
<transcript>: What I need to do.

03:41:03
<transcript>: Is build. Assess this input.

03:41:06
<transcript>: Check state of this input.

03:41:09
<transcript>: In a selector in the Tab panel.

03:41:19
<transcript>: This selector here peer check needs to turn into a much more complicated selector that's based on, like the ID pass into this thing. So this thing would have an ID.

03:41:22
<transcript>: And it would be like this.

03:41:22
<transcript>: i don't even

03:41:24
<transcript>: I don't even know if I can do this.

03:41:24
<transcript>: i don't know if it's

03:41:26
typosrry: the camera moved away, we can't see anything LUL

03:41:29
<transcript>: I don't know if it's valid to like you can't string interpolate so no, this isn't valid.

03:41:31
<transcript>: This isn't valid.

03:41:36
<transcript>: Yeah, string? Interpolate on tailwind classes.

03:41:40
<transcript>: Oh, you can't see anything. Sorry type. Oh.

03:41:48
<transcript>: Man, this is a pain.

03:41:48
<transcript>: just like

03:41:53
<transcript>: Just like an HTML. I just want an HTML.

03:41:53
<transcript>: let's see

03:41:59
<transcript>: Let's see astro. Html tab component. I just want a simple.

03:42:01
<transcript>: What is this? Are you kidding me.

03:42:01
<transcript>: is this

03:42:02
okufa_f: are you trying to navigate between tabs using css?

03:42:04
<transcript>: Is. This is this Astra.

03:42:04
<transcript>: are you kidding me

03:42:06
<transcript>: Are you kidding me.

03:42:12
<transcript>: Is this like astro. As an astro. Astro. Or is this something else.

03:42:19
<transcript>: The astro Design System Notices adele Design System html css framework.

03:42:24
<transcript>: So this is not for astros specifically, but it should be fine, though it's still if it's just HTML.

03:42:39
<transcript>: There's got to be just an HTML css tab component that I can use.

03:42:41
<transcript>: Right.

03:42:46
<transcript>: Is it Web components.

03:42:51
<transcript>: So tab panels and they have the same ID.

03:42:57
<transcript>: So this is kind of what they did.

03:43:00
<transcript>: Rux, tab.

03:43:04
<transcript>: So they share the same ID you can theoretically.

03:43:04
<transcript>: kind of

03:43:07
<transcript>: Kind of like craft the css selector.

03:43:07
<transcript>: yeah we're trying to

03:43:11
<transcript>: Yeah, we're trying to do the tab navigation akufa in css only.

03:43:11
<transcript>: you know what

03:43:13
<transcript>: You know what.

03:43:13
<transcript>: so maybe we

03:43:16
<transcript>: So maybe we don't use peer check block, but maybe.

03:43:21
<transcript>: Maybe we do this.

03:43:23
<transcript>: File.

03:43:26
<transcript>: And then we can say things like.

03:43:32
<transcript>: Display now, how does style work in here.

03:43:32
<transcript>: display

03:43:33
<transcript>: Display.

03:43:33
<transcript>: does it have to be

03:43:36
<transcript>: Does it have to be like a string display.

03:43:42
<transcript>: Style.

03:43:42
<transcript>: note

03:43:46
mecoupz: no double {

03:43:47
<transcript>: Note is recommended for sale. Separate file files, attribute and the.

03:43:47
<transcript>: style

03:43:48
<transcript>: Style.

03:43:56
<transcript>: How do I style an Astro just like in like inline styles.

03:43:58
<transcript>: Is it strange.

03:43:58
<transcript>: use a string

03:43:59
<transcript>: Use a string like this.

03:43:59
<transcript>: cool

03:44:01
<transcript>: Cool.

03:44:01
<transcript>: that

03:44:03
<transcript>: That works. That's great.

03:44:07
<transcript>: Display is going to be.

03:44:14
<transcript>: Hidden.

03:44:18
<transcript>: Or it's going to be block based on.

03:44:20
<transcript>: Selector.

03:44:26
<transcript>: How would I do that in CSS.

03:44:46
<transcript>: No, I guess would I just do it in a style sheet.

03:44:56
<transcript>: Hdml Tab component.

03:45:01
<transcript>: Wow, there's a W three schools article about it.

03:45:03
<transcript>: Are they using JavaScript.

03:45:11
<transcript>: Css and javascript. Maybe I should just use javascript. Maybe I should just bite the bullet and stop with this.

03:45:11
<transcript>: css

03:45:13
<transcript>: Css only thing.

03:45:21
<transcript>: So tab content display none. And then they probably just have javascript that sets the display based on something.

03:45:32
<transcript>: Approach, but I thought I could just use.

03:45:38
<transcript>: Here's a web dev article. That's nice.

03:45:51
<transcript>: Scroll stat points for elegant swipe and keyboard interactions.

03:45:51
<transcript>: deep link

03:45:53
<transcript>: Deep links.

03:45:53
<transcript>: screen read

03:45:58
<transcript>: Screen reader support with a and ID equals hash element markup.

03:46:04
<transcript>: Thanks for loki. Low IQ.

03:46:15
iannery: https://twitter.com/surjithctly/status/1612831829987590144 is this what youre looking for?

03:46:22
<transcript>: Fundamentally, the ux here is click a link, have the url represent the nested page state, and then see the content area update as the browser scroll to the matching element. Oh, wait a minute. Interesting, that's a different approach. Just use hashtags.

03:46:22
<transcript>: there are some struct

03:46:30
<transcript>: There are some structural content members in there links and targets. We need a list of links which a nav is great for. This might be our answer.

03:46:42
<transcript>: Clicking a link automatically focuses the target article in Chrome node js required. The user can then scroll the article content with their input devices. Always it's confirmy content as indicated in the markup.

03:46:42
<transcript>: oh

03:46:44
<transcript>: Oh.

03:46:44
<transcript>: i can establish

03:46:47
goodgrandpaa: That's cool!

03:46:49
<transcript>: I can establish connections between A and article elements with hrs and ID properties. Are you kidding me? Is this it.

03:46:53
<transcript>: 's all.

03:46:57
<transcript>: This is awesome.

03:46:59
<transcript>: Lanery. What's this link.

03:47:01
<transcript>: Copy, link.

03:47:05
fragzero_: hey @adamdotdev what api you use to update the stats? ty

03:47:09
<transcript>: What is this? Tail? Ncss. You can use peer. Yes. So we had that working.

03:47:12
<transcript>: The Pierre Checked is amazing.

03:47:15
<transcript>: Unfortunately.

03:47:16
goodgrandpaa: Perfect time for the camera to pan LUL

03:47:19
<transcript>: Maybe my problem is I'm trying to create a component, and I shouldn't.

03:47:22
<transcript>: Maybe that's the problem.

03:47:25
<transcript>: Maybe.

03:47:32
elliot0x01: Do you work for BugCrowd ?

03:47:35
<transcript>: If I just didn't build this as components, it would make sense.

03:47:38
<transcript>: Perfect time for the camera to pan.

03:47:38
<transcript>: frag

03:47:40
<transcript>: Frag Zero. Welcome to chat.

03:47:40
<transcript>: hey i'm

03:47:44
<transcript>: Hey, I'm What API you used to update the stats.

03:47:44
<transcript>: we have a real

03:47:48
<transcript>: We have a real time api. I think Sport Radar was last I knew.

03:47:52
<transcript>: But we also just have like a big historical database.

03:47:54
<transcript>: That we create ourselves.

03:47:57
<transcript>: Two different types of elements. A window.

03:48:00
<transcript>: An oversized surface.

03:48:00
<transcript>: so what's going on

03:48:02
elliot0x01: Ahh sorry, that is different adam I guess

03:48:05
elliot0x01: Sorry

03:48:13
<transcript>: So what's going on here? Snaptab layout. Low level, top level ad I chose was flex. I set the direction a column so the header in section are vertically ordered. First scroll window and it hides everything with overloo hidden. I think for the ball frag zero.

03:48:23
<transcript>: I do not work for bug crowd. I actually don't know what bug is. So what is the css Snap tabs display flex establish primary containing box.

03:48:28
<transcript>: And then sections have block size 100%.

03:48:28
<transcript>: and then head

03:48:30
<transcript>: And then headers.

03:48:32
<transcript>: Flex string.

03:48:32
<transcript>: okay

03:48:33
<transcript>: Okay.

03:48:37
<transcript>: Putting back.

03:48:40
<transcript>: So is this good? Is this what I want.

03:48:46
<transcript>: Is this what I want.

03:48:50
<transcript>: Tab, setters, and nav layout.

03:48:54
iannery: sounds complex but if it works then it works

03:49:01
<transcript>: This seems like what I want.

03:49:07
<transcript>: Yeah, it sounds complex, but if it works, it works.

03:49:11
<transcript>: It does seem like.

03:49:11
<transcript>: oh

03:49:16
<transcript>: Oh, it's scrolling within one container, though it's not really what I want.

03:49:21
<transcript>: I mean, I guess that's okay though. I wonder if that's.

03:49:35
<transcript>: I wouldn't look right on desktop, though. No, this is different. This is different. Let's do this thing. Let's just forget the components. My problem is I'm just trying to build components is really hard for me to figure out how to componentize this. So let's do this.

03:49:39
<transcript>: Let's go back to invadebox for let's forget about all this stuff.

03:49:44
<transcript>: Let's just do this.

03:49:48
<transcript>: This is a div.

03:49:52
<transcript>: And if this was a div.

03:50:03
<transcript>: So this is the complicated thing.

03:50:14
<transcript>: This is kind of complicated. That's each tab looks like that.

03:50:22
<transcript>: This is going to be.

03:50:26
<transcript>: Let's teams app.

03:50:30
<transcript>: And then we'll say this one is checked.

03:50:35
<transcript>: The props. Id. This is just gonna be.

03:50:40
<transcript>: Tab one.

03:50:47
<transcript>: Okay. So I'm forgetting about the components for a second, and we're just doing this the hard way.

03:50:49
<transcript>: This should be flex.

03:50:54
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:51:01
<transcript>: There's another one. It was going to be team stats or player stats.

03:51:05
<transcript>: This should be.

03:51:08
<transcript>: For.

03:51:14
<transcript>: Geez.

03:51:19
<transcript>: Let's tab one.

03:51:22
<transcript>: This is Tab two.

03:51:27
<transcript>: Okay players app. Nice.

03:51:31
<transcript>: Okay.

03:51:31
<transcript>: and then

03:51:33
<transcript>: And then this is our content.

03:51:38
<transcript>: This Div is gonna be watch, watch this, watch this.

03:51:48
<transcript>: Hidden and this can be display. It's going to be a block. If.

03:51:54
<transcript>: This tab one. Okay, so we need a selector here.

03:51:57
<transcript>: It's gonna be like.

03:52:00
<transcript>: Tab one.

03:52:05
<transcript>: Hash Tab one.

03:52:05
<transcript>: checked

03:52:07
<transcript>: Checked or something.

03:52:14
<transcript>: And it's going to be blocked. Does that work? Can I just do that.

03:52:17
<transcript>: That work.

03:52:23
<transcript>: How does it work? Does it work? No.

03:52:33
<transcript>: See, I need that to fill all the space as well. So not flex. Maybe.

03:52:40
<transcript>: It's like.

03:52:45
<transcript>: Flex, justify, stretch or something.

03:52:47
<transcript>: Justify.

03:52:50
<transcript>: Stretch.

03:52:50
<transcript>: for item

03:52:51
<transcript>: For items.

03:52:54
<transcript>: Stretch.

03:52:57
<transcript>: Maybe.

03:53:00
<transcript>: No.

03:53:07
<transcript>: I have.

03:53:09
<transcript>: Two of those.

03:53:12
<transcript>: Oh, this is like the.

03:53:14
<transcript>: Tab.

03:53:18
<transcript>: Flex with full I don't know.

03:56:52
<transcript>: For some reason, I'm not able to do that.

03:56:56
iannery: maybe try with

03:56:57
<transcript>: From another element. You know, I'm saying.

03:57:01
<transcript>: Tailwind.

03:57:03
iannery: [.yadayada]

<transcript>: Arbitrary selectors.

03:57:11
<transcript>: It's not even a sibling.

03:57:17
iannery: instead of hash

03:57:25

03:57:25
<transcript>: that's a child

03:57:27
<transcript>: That's a child class, though.

03:58:13
<transcript>: I see to go out and find it.

03:58:28
<transcript>: Oh, if I put the Pier on it. Does that work? No, that wouldn't work, because I need to specify a very specific Pier.

03:58:32
<transcript>: So what if I did this.

03:58:32
<transcript>: i think that's gonna

04:00:10
<transcript>: No, no.

04:00:19
caryyon: oh boy, you are in the messy parts of tailwind right now!

04:00:20
<transcript>: We could also know.

04:00:23
<transcript>: I mean, we could base it on, like.

04:00:27
<transcript>: Javascript.

04:00:27
<transcript>: we could have

04:00:30
<transcript>: We could have like the hash thing in the URL.

04:00:30
<transcript>: i don't love it

04:00:32
<transcript>: I don't love it I just don't love it.

04:00:32

morocodes: Howdy feynriHowdy

04:00:45
x4heid: [id=tab-1]?

04:00:47
<transcript>: I think that's possible. Let's do a chijbc, says.

04:00:47
lifelessirl: what API are u using?

04:00:50
<transcript>: How do I.

04:00:50
<transcript>: id

04:00:52
<transcript>: Id equals tab. One.

04:00:52
<transcript>: oh

04:00:54
<transcript>: Oh, does that work.

04:00:59
<transcript>: Does that work? More codes. Howdy welcome to my chat.

04:01:01
<transcript>: Welcome, welcome.

04:01:05
<transcript>: I'm in the messy parts. The tablet tailwind. That's right.

04:01:05
<transcript>: let's do

04:01:08
<transcript>: Let's do ID equals tab. One.

04:01:08
<transcript>: and

04:01:10
<transcript>: And then.

04:01:10
<transcript>: check

04:01:11
<transcript>: Check.

04:01:16
<transcript>: That's what I want.

04:01:16
<transcript>: just don't

04:01:18
<transcript>: Just don't know if that works.

04:01:20
<transcript>: Does not.

04:01:20
<transcript>: does not

04:01:22
<transcript>: Does not work.

04:01:22
<transcript>: what api

04:01:26
<transcript>: What api are you using? What do you mean? Like lifeless.

04:01:28
<transcript>: What api for what.

04:01:33
<transcript>: Bomber, bomber, Bummer, bummer.

04:01:40
<transcript>: Bomber bummer ID. Tab one is it not like that, though.

04:01:42
<transcript>: Not like this.

04:01:45
iannery: try with checked on the outside maybe?

04:01:45
lifelessirl: where do u get the results from?

04:01:46
<transcript>: Is it out there.

04:01:47
<transcript>: I don't think so.

04:01:53
<transcript>: Where do we get the results from? We've got a giant database that we've created.

04:01:53
mecoupz: maybe post that on twitter and tag tailwind there?

04:01:58
<transcript>: We hired a statistician for like five years.

04:01:58
<transcript>: and

04:02:01
<transcript>: And maybe post that on Twitter and tag tailwind there.

04:02:01
<transcript>: maybe

04:02:04
<transcript>: Maybe try with check on the app.

04:02:04
<transcript>: just tried

04:02:06
<transcript>: Just tried that.

04:02:10
<transcript>: I feel like I should build a find some tailwind.

04:02:10
<transcript>: tailwind

04:02:12
<transcript>: Tailwind.

04:02:17
<transcript>: Radio Check style.

04:02:20
<transcript>: Would you be able to find some examples of this.

04:02:20
<transcript>: change label

04:02:23
<transcript>: Change label with a radio button. Checked. Yeah. Here we go.

04:02:28
<transcript>: It's gonna be like peer checked or something. No, this is even older.

04:02:35
<transcript>: Yeah, peer checked. Bummer. Can't do that. It's not a peer. Unfortunately.

04:02:38
<transcript>: I don't think.

04:02:38
<transcript>: now it's

04:02:40
<transcript>: Now it's not a piece.

04:02:46
<transcript>: Pure class. That would be nice.

04:02:48
<transcript>: How do you do that, though.

04:02:55
iannery: what about making it a peer?

04:02:55
<transcript>: Two classes. Hml. Add the pure class to the hml tag. You want to observe the State Board and the peer checked class.

04:02:59
<transcript>: But what if I have multiple tabs.

04:03:03
<transcript>: What if I have multiple tabs.

04:03:06
lifelessirl: so basically theres one person who manually puts the results, and stats? sorry, im new at this xD

04:03:10
<transcript>: What about making it appear? Well, there's multiple tabs. Like, I don't know how that would work, because.

04:03:13
<transcript>: It's not in the dom. It's not appear.

04:03:17
<transcript>: There's one person who manually puts the results in set. Sorry, I know. What? This? Oh, you're fine. Lifeless.

04:03:17
<transcript>: no

04:03:25
<transcript>: No, we had a statistician. He built up our historical database, but we also subscribed to real time stats through Sports Radar. I think.

04:03:25
<transcript>: it's been awhile

04:03:25
morocodes: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#differentiating-peers

04:03:27
<transcript>: It's been awhile since I've looked.

04:03:27
morocodes: ^

04:03:31
<transcript>: Tailwind Hover Focus different gening peers different energy peers.

04:03:31
<transcript>: this

04:03:36
<transcript>: This looks exactly like what I need it's last thing I got time for and then we're gonna I'm gonna get out of here.

04:03:36
<transcript>: let's see

04:03:37
mecoupz: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#checked maybe check:[id=tab-1]:block ?

04:03:37
