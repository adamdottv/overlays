00:13:19
<transcript>: i

00:13:23
<transcript>: I blinked. I'm bad at that. I do blink.

00:13:23
<transcript>: something

00:13:30
<transcript>: Something just happened. I don't know what it was a subscriber. Why is my activity feed broken? Why is it so broken.

00:13:34
<transcript>: I did not see I don't know who subscribed to me.

00:13:34
<transcript>: thank you so much

00:13:35
<transcript>: Thank you so much.

00:13:38
<transcript>: Person to Subscribe.

00:13:41
<transcript>: Who subscribed? I hate that.

00:13:41
<transcript>: some

00:13:49
<transcript>: Some reason. For some reason, my overlays made me aware of it, but the Twitch activity feed does not say anything.

00:13:49
<transcript>: i don't know

00:13:51
<transcript>: I don't know why.

00:13:51
<transcript>: i don't

00:14:01
<transcript>: I don't know. Why. What was that? What was that? Oh, I saw that one, matense. Thank you for the following tensus. Thank you. Somebody who subscribed. I appreciate it so much.

00:14:01
<transcript>: so

00:14:02
cowfacedude99: I can rick roll you into working LUL

00:14:05
<transcript>: So Nick's has been Mark McCullough's here.

00:14:10
<transcript>: Or maybe Mark McCullough, subscribe. Is that why you're waving.

00:14:10
<transcript>: are you raising

00:14:14
markmccullohdev: twas me

00:14:14
<transcript>: Are you raising your hand? You can rip roll me into working. Don't do it. Cow face.

00:14:14
<transcript>: nick

00:14:17
<transcript>: Nick's been a little fun and a little pain today.

00:14:24
<transcript>: All right, so here's what we're gonna do. Mark McColla, thank you so much.

00:14:24
<transcript>: thank you so much

00:14:26
<transcript>: Thank you so much for that subscription.

00:14:28
<transcript>: I appreciate it greatly.

00:14:32
<transcript>: We're gonna We're gonna build.

00:14:32
<transcript>: we're gonna build

00:14:36
<transcript>: We're gonna build I want to play with Dream Booth because.

00:14:36
<transcript>: so

00:14:44
<transcript>: So I've talked about status. Have I talked about Stamis? Started sent me like eight years ago. Something like that.

00:14:44
<transcript>: i'm doing

00:14:50
<transcript>: I'm doing a little project for Sat Muse, where I'm gonna make some, like.

00:14:53
<transcript>: Portraits of athletes.

00:14:53
<transcript>: in all kinds of different

00:14:55
<transcript>: In all kinds of different styles.

00:14:59
<transcript>: This is an unsanctioned project. I wasn't asked to do this. I want to do this.

00:15:02
<transcript>: So.

00:15:02
<transcript>: we're

00:15:06
<transcript>: We're gonna get stable diffusion going running on my Mac.

00:15:06
<transcript>: and

00:15:09
<transcript>: And what I'd really like to do.

00:15:09
<transcript>: is like build

00:15:13
<transcript>: Is like build a little web page, just a simple little web app.

00:15:13
<transcript>: where you like

00:15:33
<transcript>: Where you like can drag photos of yourself or some person onto it and then create portraits with Dream Boosts. Think that'd be super cool right now. It seems like everything's a Wild West like you just download and install it all locally and run it. Why not have a web based thing? I mean I guess like GPU's are expensive, so like doing it.

00:15:33
<transcript>: on the server

00:15:35
<transcript>: On the server.

00:15:40
<transcript>: Pattern. Maybe that's why no one's done it. Because it's like, why not have people do it on their own machine.

00:15:50
<transcript>: But I want to play with at least I want to see how how gnarly is it to get it running on the Mac. And then could we turn that into something we can run in a Linux container or something.

00:15:54
<transcript>: Yeah, that's what we're gonna do. Let's do it. I need to change the time.

00:15:57
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:15:57
<transcript>: change the tit

00:16:11
<transcript>: Change the title of this stream. It's not what I hope I didn't bait and switch anybody if anyone was really excited about building AW guess with X state in neovem, we will use neovem and maybe we'll use xDate. I don't know. Maybe.

00:16:14
<transcript>: What are we doing? We're making.

00:16:16
texoport: I was excited about xstate lol

00:16:18
<transcript>: Playing with.

00:16:20
<transcript>: Diffusion.

00:16:24
<transcript>: And remove.

00:16:30
<transcript>: And then I'm going to just put new.

00:16:31
theruggedbear: staple diffusion ?

00:16:33
<transcript>: It's my.

00:16:33
<transcript>: bait

00:16:35
<transcript>: Bait thing.

00:16:35
<transcript>: we do

00:16:40
<transcript>: We do use neo them on this stream and ever since I started putting the of them in the title.

00:16:46
<transcript>: People just they like that. They like it a whole lot. Okay, let's do it.

00:16:46
<transcript>: let's

00:16:53
<transcript>: Let's do it. Am I still here? Are you guys still here? Are we still in chat? I just noticed. Like nobody has said anything for, like.

00:16:55
<transcript>: Four minutes.

00:16:57
<transcript>: Did I lose you all.

00:16:59
yeltrah_: I just goto here

00:17:05
<transcript>: okay

00:17:11
<transcript>: Okay, heart jeans. Here. You just got your heart Jean, but yeah, alright, let's do it.

00:17:16
<transcript>: See this? See what this is? Right here.

00:17:16
<transcript>: this is

00:17:18
<transcript>: This is a blank.

00:17:18
<transcript>: a blank

jenswoeste: #fixlighting?

00:17:33
<transcript>: I think there's something wrong with my OBS.

00:17:37
<transcript>: I get the sense there's a problem.

00:17:39
<transcript>: With my OBS.

00:17:46
<transcript>: So I knew there's a problem when I tried to start the stream and I couldn't hear anything.

00:17:48
<transcript>: But then that fixed itself.

00:17:48
<transcript>: so

00:17:51
<transcript>: So why is this not working.

00:17:51
<transcript>: let's

00:17:52
<transcript>: Let's.

00:17:52
jaystation3x: Looks exactly like my desktop, in fact.

00:18:30
<transcript>: Method display capture.

00:18:32
<transcript>: Okay.

00:18:38
<transcript>: Hey, maybe this will work. Transform fit to screen.

00:18:38
<transcript>: let's drop it

00:18:39
<transcript>: Let's drop it down here.

00:18:39
<transcript>: okay so

00:18:41
<transcript>: Okay. So something.

00:18:41
<transcript>: something

00:18:41
theruggedbear: is it just me or is Adam too shiny ?

00:18:44
<transcript>: Something broke with this one.

00:18:46
<transcript>: We're just gonna delete it.

00:18:50
<transcript>: Okay.

00:18:50
<transcript>: well

00:18:51
<transcript>: Well.

00:18:54
<transcript>: Am I too shiny? Oh, is the lighting.

00:18:57
<transcript>: Is the lighting bed. I might be too shiny.

00:18:57
<transcript>: hey one sec

00:18:59
<transcript>: Hey, one SEC. I can fix that.

00:19:01
jenswoeste: looks like you have a 987935733645 lumen lamp in the room. Or maybe im just overly sensitive to light

00:19:03
<transcript>: You guys can look at my.

00:19:05
<transcript>: Oh, nothing works.

00:19:05
<transcript>: nothing

00:19:06
<transcript>: Nothing.

00:19:06
<transcript>: nothing

00:19:08
<transcript>: Nothing works.

00:19:12
<transcript>: What is going on? Obs.

00:19:16
<transcript>: What is the problem.

00:19:18
<transcript>: There it is.

00:19:21
<transcript>: Okay.

00:19:24
theruggedbear: @JensWoeste my eyes were slowly closing lmao

00:19:25
<transcript>: Everything looks like it's falling.

00:19:25
<transcript>: to one side

00:19:29
<transcript>: To one side. It's like slowing off. I think something's crooked.

00:19:33
<transcript>: Hang I'm gonna be our back.

00:19:50
jaystation3x: Lego model of the great SF earthquake

00:19:51
jenswoeste: maybe change title to "fixing obs setup while playing with stableddiffusion and dreambooth (neovim)"?

00:20:11
<transcript>: All Right, MLS. Shiny.

00:20:11
<transcript>: how's that

00:20:12
<transcript>: How's that.

00:20:12
<transcript>: oh

00:20:13
<transcript>: Oh.

00:20:21
<transcript>: Whoa, someone's chat. What am I missing? Looks like you have something big number Lumen Slamp in the room.

00:20:21
<transcript>: overly sensitive

00:20:25
<transcript>: Overly sensitive delights were slowly closing clothing. Lego model.

00:20:32
<transcript>: Fixing obvious set up while playing the stable Diffusion Three minutes good call in my life shining my good yiens.

00:20:35
<transcript>: Feel good about it.

00:20:35
<transcript>: not

00:20:38
<transcript>: Not like too bright.

00:20:38
<transcript>: for your

00:20:38
jenswoeste: works

00:20:40
<transcript>: For your eyes.

00:20:51
<transcript>: I think I'm less shiny now works. Okay, let's do it now. I change the title. I change the title. Let's listen to music because who knows what the like for now, listen to music.

00:20:51
<transcript>: then

00:20:52
<transcript>: Then.

00:20:52
<transcript>: i don't know

00:20:55
<transcript>: I don't know. Maybe nothing good on this stream.

00:20:55
<transcript>: let's see if music

00:21:00
<transcript>: Let's see if music works. I don't know what's gonna work? Everything's broken? Opia.

00:21:03
<transcript>: It's not happy. Alright, so I'm gonna open a new browser window.

00:21:06
<transcript>: Who's Who's played with Stable Excusion? For.

00:21:15
<transcript>: Me.

00:21:18
<transcript>: Nobody.

00:21:23
<transcript>: Anymore. Stable diffusion is. Am I speaking words you don't understand.

00:21:23
<transcript>: somebody

00:21:25
<transcript>: Somebody tell me you know what it is.

00:21:28
<transcript>: I'll say what it is.

00:21:30
nxception: nope

00:21:33
daglee: I know what it is.

00:21:35
<transcript>: You surely know what stable diffusion is.

00:21:35
<transcript>: but

00:21:38
<transcript>: But do you know what Dream Booth is.

00:21:42
<transcript>: So Dream booth is like this Google.

00:21:42
<transcript>: thing

00:21:44
<transcript>: Thing.

00:21:44
<transcript>: google

00:21:47
daglee: I have used it, but not programmed it

00:22:00
<transcript>: Google put out a paper, and then some, like, tech that it's a model that, like, puts subjects into multiple settings. So, like, take somebody's face, put them in lots of places. So, oh, here you go. Like, Jason Langstorf, learn with Jason.

00:22:04
<transcript>: This Vincent Reamer, who works at meta.

00:22:10
<transcript>: Made a dream boost model for his face. And so here he is in all these places.

00:22:12
<transcript>: Right, so, cool.

00:22:18
<transcript>: So cool. Right. Okay. Then there's him in Fortnite.

00:22:18
<transcript>: we're gonna do

00:22:23
<transcript>: We're gonna do this with athletes. And there's a bobble, like a little action figure. That's too good.

00:22:23
<transcript>: i just love this

00:22:25
<transcript>: I just love this thing.

00:22:34
theruggedbear: alright, you caught my attention. i want to put my face everywhere

00:22:35
<transcript>: So that's Dream Booth and you can use you can like take the Dream Booth model and work with it and stable diffusion somehow. I don't know. Ai.

00:22:38
<transcript>: Something we're gonna find out.

00:22:45
<transcript>: We're gonna find out installing Drew Booth and stable diffusion for beginners.

00:22:45
<transcript>: that's me

00:22:46
iserejatoje: I would like to look at you

00:22:47
<transcript>: That's me. I'm a beginner.

00:22:53
nxception: that's pretty cool

00:22:54
<transcript>: I would like to look at you.

00:22:54
<transcript>: would you

00:22:56
<transcript>: Would you.

00:23:00
<transcript>: Want to put your face everywhere. Oh, you're talking to him.

00:23:06
<transcript>: Yeah, no, it's gonna be super cool, right? And I think it'd be cooler if we could get it running.

00:23:08
<transcript>: In like.

00:23:08
<transcript>: the

00:23:20
jenswoeste: almost same title: https://github.com/XavierXiao/Dreambooth-Stable-Diffusion

00:23:22
<transcript>: The cloud. If we could rent some computers, put it up in the cloud and put a little web portal where you drop a bunch of photos. It trains the model of your face and you can get like portraits of yourself all over the place and whatever context. I think that's a just a fun little app to build.

00:23:22
<transcript>: i

00:23:26
<transcript>: I'm also almost same title.

00:23:26
<transcript>: i'm also

00:23:28
theruggedbear: AWS tutorial ? p4nth3rHYPE

00:23:40
<transcript>: I'm also like hand waving. I've never done this. I've never played with it. It might be like it might take 4 hours to train a model. I have no idea. So there may be reasons this doesn't exist as just like a web portal I can go to and play with, but we're gonna try.

00:23:43
<transcript>: So this is.

00:23:43
<transcript>: dream boost

00:23:46
<transcript>: Dream Boost and Sable Diffusion for Beginners from a beginner.

00:23:48
<transcript>: Dad.

00:23:50
<transcript>: Here's a video.

00:23:54
<transcript>: I don't want windows.

00:24:18
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow Sander monkey also user bin boat.

00:24:21
<transcript>: Aws, tutorial.

00:24:25
gigo6000: morning Adam

00:24:31
<transcript>: It's gonna be we're gonna bit we're gonna get running on my Mac first, and we're gonna figure out how big of a pain. What are the gotches here.

00:24:39
<transcript>: And then we can talk about could we run this thing? I've got so many AWS credits like I don't even care. I could run some GPU instances.

00:24:39
<transcript>: and not really

00:24:41
<transcript>: And not really care what it costs.

00:24:41
<transcript>: for a while

00:24:43
<transcript>: For a while.

00:24:49
<transcript>: Okay.

00:24:49
<transcript>: so

00:24:54
<transcript>: So what is this implementation of Google's Dream Boots with Civil diffusion.

00:25:01
<transcript>: Two, nine. Okay, so this seems like is this the one linked? Yeah, this seems like the winner so far, some Python.

00:25:01
<transcript>: okay

00:25:02
<transcript>: Okay.

00:25:16
<transcript>: Original Dream Booth is based on Imagin, and we're doing this with stable diffusion. Neither the model nor the pretrained weights of Imagin is available to enable people to finetune text image models. Few examples.

00:25:17
<transcript>: Of Dream booth.

00:25:17
<transcript>: stabilization

00:25:23
<transcript>: Stabilization. You know what? I actually want to look, if he's put out any guides for how he's done it.

00:25:23
<transcript>: he

00:25:29
<transcript>: He's been doing this so there's him in like different contexts anime him.

00:25:38
theruggedbear: i've seen this one: https://github.com/JoePenna/Dreambooth-Stable-Diffusion

00:25:39
<transcript>: I wonder if he says, like the tech he's using because his stuff looks so good. Oh, behind the scenes.

00:25:39
<transcript>: dream

00:25:41
<transcript>: Dream booth, stuff.

00:25:43
<transcript>: So what is he using.

00:25:53
<transcript>: So he took this image and added more detail to it.

00:26:02
<transcript>: Okay. Here's the UI he's using.

00:26:04
<transcript>: Okay.

00:26:04
<transcript>: that's something

00:26:05
<transcript>: That's something.

00:26:16
<transcript>: A browser interface based on Gradio library for stable fusion. So this is what we just saw. He was playing with that user interface.

00:26:20
<transcript>: Okay.

00:26:35
<transcript>: Nvidia or AMD I don't even know what kind of.

00:26:35
<transcript>: i don't know

00:26:39
<transcript>: I don't know what kind of GPU these things have anybody know.

00:26:47
daglee: They have their own

00:26:48
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:26:53
<transcript>: Macintosh HD System report.

00:26:53
daglee: So it's neither

00:26:56
<transcript>: Anybody just know what the Mac studio.

00:26:59
<transcript>: Gpus are.

00:27:05
<transcript>: Here we go.

00:27:08
<transcript>: Is it just built into the M one.

00:27:11
<transcript>: What.

00:27:14
daglee: Yes

00:27:16
jenswoeste: yeah - built in

00:27:17
daglee: Built in

00:27:19
<transcript>: Is that how it works? Just a built in like the M. One has a GPU built into it. That seems wrong.

00:27:21
<transcript>: That seems wrong.

00:27:24
<transcript>: Mad studio.

00:27:24
<transcript>: g

00:27:26
<transcript>: Gpu.

00:27:29
jenswoeste: same on the m1 max

00:27:33
<transcript>: That seems wrong there's no way right.

00:27:40
<transcript>: this is you buy is taking over for the worse

00:27:42
<transcript>: Where does it say GPU.

00:27:48
<transcript>: 32 core GPU.

00:27:49
fredkisss: The M1 chip is all builtins

00:27:56
<transcript>: Is it? Nvidia is it in one chip is all builtins. Really? Okay.

00:28:01
<transcript>: Interesting. So I guess this works on a new one. I hope this works on anyone.

00:28:07
<transcript>: This might be a short stream, or at least a short.

00:28:07
<transcript>: attempt

00:28:10
<transcript>: Attempt it's able to fusion if you can't run it on an M one.

00:28:17
jenswoeste: I think you probably need to use apple metal

00:28:20
<transcript>: Oh, we're running the cloud? We'll run into the cloud.

00:28:20
<transcript>: if that's

00:28:21
<transcript>: If that's what we gotta do.

00:28:25
<transcript>: One.

00:28:25
<transcript>: let's see

00:28:28
<transcript>: Let's see. Let's just search a stable diffusion.

00:28:30
<transcript>: M. One, Mac.

00:28:33
<transcript>: Now I'm guessing you can't do it.

00:28:33
<transcript>: or maybe

00:28:35
<transcript>: Or maybe you can.

00:28:35
<transcript>: we'll see

00:28:36
<transcript>: We'll see.

00:28:41
<transcript>: A Gooey app for M. One Mac.

00:28:47
<transcript>: Okay. Hugging face. Sounds familiar.

00:28:53
<transcript>: Hello, there's all kinds of articles. This is gonna be possible.

00:28:57
<transcript>: In the cloud.

00:28:57
<transcript>: i replicate

00:28:59
<transcript>: I replicate. What is this.

00:29:05
<transcript>: Oh, really, somebody does have, like a web.

00:29:05
<transcript>: based

00:29:06
<transcript>: Based.

00:29:12
<transcript>: Run on your own computer.

00:29:18
<transcript>: Do they also have train booth.

00:29:21
jenswoeste: FrankKrueger (here on twitch) also plays around with a lot of neural networks. He uses mac but has a dedicated linux box (on a closet) that has a 3090

00:29:22
<transcript>: Let's replicate.

00:29:30
<transcript>: Run open source models with a cloud API. Okay. I want to explore the models, and I want to find dream.

00:29:30
<transcript>: booth

00:29:32
<transcript>: Booth. No.

00:29:36
jenswoeste: he uses that for training

00:29:36
<transcript>: So they don't do dream booth. Okay.

00:29:39
<transcript>: They do a lot of stuff, though.

00:29:58
<transcript>: Probably need to use Apple Metals. Frank Kruger here on Twitch, also plays around with a lot of neural networks. Use the Mac, but has a dedicated Linux box in a closet.

00:30:06
<transcript>: That is a 30. 90. Okay, that makes sense. I've got a rack in my closet. I could put something in there.

00:30:08
<transcript>: Are there like rack base.

00:30:14
<transcript>: Gpu rigs that are just prebuilt that I have to think about, because that'd be cool. I don't want to, like, build it myself.

00:30:14
<transcript>: i guess i could

00:30:18
<transcript>: I guess I could, but I don't want to thank Audi.

00:30:18
<transcript>: i'm not

00:30:20
<transcript>: I'm not drinking Danny Bun today.

00:30:20
<transcript>: the my

00:30:28
<transcript>: The my regular friend here on Twitch. No, this would normally be Dandy Blunt. It's not. It's a T. It's a black T.

00:30:28
<transcript>: salt

00:30:31
<transcript>: Salted, Caramel. It's quite delicious.

00:30:40
<transcript>: It also has caffeine in it so this might be hopped up at him, might be done. Some some AI stuff on caffeine.

00:30:46
<transcript>: So it does sound like this is all possible.

00:30:49
<transcript>: With an M. One. Right.

00:30:49
<transcript>: i don't know

00:30:52
<transcript>: I don't know where the steps.

00:30:52
<transcript>: the fus

00:30:54
<transcript>: The fusion beats.

00:30:58
<transcript>: We still were focused on Dream booth.

00:31:04
<transcript>: So we'll just.

00:31:07
<transcript>: We'll keep going down the.

00:31:07
<transcript>: so

00:31:11
jenswoeste: he is currently training a model to control his "balancebot" - think it as an oversized segway robot that can follow him around (when not driving fiercly into his shin)

00:31:11
<transcript>: So he uses this this Web UI. Where is that this one.

00:31:14
<transcript>: I don't know.

00:31:20
<transcript>: How much of the setup this thing goes into? Let's see if he stalked anymore. About what he's doing.

00:31:41
<transcript>: These are so cool. Dream Booth is just amazing.

00:31:52
<transcript>: Okay.

00:31:59
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow.

00:32:02
<transcript>: following

00:32:02
<transcript>: following to see if

00:32:05
<transcript>: Following to see if he.

00:32:15
<transcript>: Talks anymore. Let's just search his tweets. Let's just search.

00:32:15
<transcript>: from

00:32:17
<transcript>: From Vincent.

00:32:17
<transcript>: rimer

00:32:18
<transcript>: Rimer.

00:32:31
<transcript>: He mentioned.

00:32:31
<transcript>: okay

00:32:35
<transcript>: Okay. It's a fine tune version of SD using Dream booth.

00:32:38
<transcript>: So this is what he used.

00:32:43
<transcript>: I.

00:32:45
<transcript>: Stable diffusion I.

00:32:47
<transcript>: Just as training.

00:32:50
<transcript>: Okay.

00:32:57
<transcript>: So it requires a 30. 90 minimum due to its V range requirements.

00:33:01
<transcript>: Warned up tips on getting the best results can be found in the Discord channel.

00:33:07
<transcript>: So we can always go to the cloud if we need to doing this seems to be the way to go for this sort of thing.

00:33:11
ttbishop: my 3060 has 12gb, works as well

00:33:21
<transcript>: So this is what he's using right here. Implementation of Dream Booth by way of textual inversion for stable diffusion. Tweaks focus on training faces, objects and styles.

00:33:24
<transcript>: Okay.

00:33:40
stroopwafel26: Ooh I know this one. ML on images on a Mac is bullshit, you're gonna need a dedicated box with an nvidia GPU to make life easier

00:33:46
<transcript>: Currently training a model to control his balance spot. It's a oversized Segway robot that can follow him around when not driving fiercely into the shit.

00:33:46
<transcript>: wow

00:33:48
<transcript>: Wow.

00:33:51
<transcript>: 36 years, 12GB works as well.

00:33:57
<transcript>: Gonna need a dedicated box with an Nvidia GPU to make life easier. Okay, so let's just do this.

00:34:00
<transcript>: Aws.

00:34:00
<transcript>: ec

00:34:07
<transcript>: Ec 230 90. I don't know. Is that the one we need? That's exactly the one we need. That GPU.

00:34:13
<transcript>: Can you even get a 390 on AWS.

00:34:13
<transcript>: it might be

00:34:17
ttbishop: no, you need one with 24gb +

00:34:17
<transcript>: It might be some, like Tesla equivalent. Oh, here we go.

00:34:25
<transcript>: 30, 90.

00:34:27
stroopwafel26: you can also use a v100

00:34:32
<transcript>: Nvidia. Aging Tensor core.

00:34:32
<transcript>: it's

00:34:34
2dorkstv: morning, fellow nerds!

00:34:35
<transcript>: It's a cutdown. 30 90.

00:34:46
<transcript>: I don't know. I'm imagining one of these Tesla V 100s would also.

00:34:46
<transcript>: work

00:34:48
<transcript>: Work.

00:34:48
jenswoeste: maybe google has some 3090'ies laying around since they are killing stadia LUL

00:34:50
ttbishop: it's about the VRAM, 3090 is if you're running it locally

00:34:52
stroopwafel26: @2DorksTV morning king of the nerds

00:34:58
<transcript>: There's another thing I was gonna search. Oh, yeah. Like, you can just buy these things.

00:35:00
<transcript>: Is it into Nvidia.

00:35:08
<transcript>: I know there's like it was really hard to get a hold of graphics cards. Are they not hard to get a hold of anymore? Like I could just put one of these.

00:35:08
<transcript>: lim

00:35:10
<transcript>: Limits.

00:35:14
<transcript>: Rack Mount.

00:35:18
<transcript>: Like if I just want one of these.

00:35:23
<transcript>: I want to just see what that looks like.

00:35:24
2dorkstv: @stroopwafel26 I like to think of it as a nerdy round table

00:35:30
daglee: They are quite easy to buy now.

00:35:36
aifonx0: mining go BRRRR

00:35:38
<transcript>: Who sells the best rack Mount computers rack Mount servers for GPU rendering.

00:35:41
<transcript>: Good morning to dorks.

00:35:41
<transcript>: okay you can

00:35:44
<transcript>: Okay. You can also use a V 100 cool, cool, cool.

00:35:52
<transcript>: Maybe Google has some 39s lying around since they're killing Stadia you know kidding.

00:35:52
<transcript>: thirty nine

00:35:55
<transcript>: 39, is if you're running it locally.

00:36:03
<transcript>: They're quite easy to buy now, cool, cool, welcome to Chat elfhonks.

00:36:06
stroopwafel26: google and killing products, name a more iconic duo

00:36:10
<transcript>: Mining. Gopr. We're not gonna be mining. We're gonna be training. Okay, so here's a rack Mount.

00:36:15
<transcript>: I want rack Mount. I don't want to build my own. I want like, a prebuilt. Let's see.

00:36:15
<transcript>: ra

00:36:21
<transcript>: Rack mounted GPU Render Rendering server.

00:36:22
<transcript>: You know, I'm saying.

00:36:25
<transcript>: Feel like somebody's made this.

00:36:30
<transcript>: Here we go.

00:36:35
<transcript>: In Nvidia RTX servers.

00:36:42
<transcript>: These are what these are. So let's see.

00:36:48
<transcript>: Where does it say with these GPUs are.

00:36:53
<transcript>: Eight GPU. So they all have the same GPUs. Just.

00:36:58
<transcript>: Anybody casting what these are.

00:37:06
<transcript>: Okay. So this is something I can look at. I can look at this after.

00:37:06
<transcript>: but

00:37:07
jenswoeste: looks like a cheap option

00:37:09
stroopwafel26: you don't need a server, you can just buy a pc and slap a gpu in there

00:37:14
<transcript>: But we may need to run this in AWS. Sounds like Dream booth not gonna be great on an M one based on.

00:37:14
<transcript>: vram

00:37:16
<transcript>: Vram how much? V. Ram.

00:37:16
<transcript>: how much

00:37:17
<transcript>: How much? Vram.

00:37:17
<transcript>: mac

00:37:19
<transcript>: Mac studio.

00:37:23
<transcript>: Gpu VRAM.

00:37:26
<transcript>: Is this the amount of Ram on the DPU.

00:37:33
<transcript>: Oh, it shares the Ram.

00:37:40
jenswoeste: https://replicate.com/blog/run-stable-diffusion-on-m1-mac

00:37:40
ttbishop: vram = video ram

00:37:40
<transcript>: Oh, does it say over here.

00:37:44
<transcript>: Total number of cores 48.

00:37:48
<transcript>: I don't see VRAM listed.

00:37:52
<transcript>: Anybody see.

00:37:56
<transcript>: A thing I should click on.

00:37:59
daglee: Doesn't it use system ram?

00:38:01
<transcript>: No.

00:38:04
<transcript>: Okay.

00:38:04
<transcript>: let's

00:38:05
<transcript>: Let's.

00:38:11
iserejatoje: vram vram vram - motor sound

00:38:12
techdebtninja: I believe your RAM and VRAM are shared.

00:38:18
<transcript>: Don't need a server. You can do buy PC and slap a GPU in there. Well, I don't want to, like, have a CPU sitting around in my office. I want it in my rack, in the closet, so I don't have to see it. You know, I'm saying.

00:38:20
nullchefo: Ram on the M1 is shared between the CPU and the gpu

00:38:29
2dorkstv: rack mounted servers are always *so* loud too

00:38:31
<transcript>: Replicate runsibly Fusion on M one Mac. Yeah yeah I think yen's we've got some articles. I don't know if the VRAM is gonna be enough for Dream Boost specifically training Dream booth.

00:38:36
<transcript>: Ram and Vramer shared. Okay, well, then I've got 64 gigs of Ram.

00:38:40
<transcript>: Ram on the M one is shared between CPU and GPU. Okay.

00:38:43
<transcript>: Well.

00:38:47
stroopwafel26: @adamdotdev if you're only needing it once, you can only run SD on your M1 Mac, though you'll not be able to render high res images

00:38:53
<transcript>: In that case, do we think I can train a Dream Booth model? What do we think? If you need to have a 30 90 and I have an M. One Max studio.

00:38:53
<transcript>: does anyone

00:38:55
<transcript>: Does anyone think we're gonna be able to do this.

00:38:55
<transcript>: does he say anything

00:38:58
<transcript>: Does he say anything about M. One here.

00:38:58
<transcript>: he or she

00:38:59
<transcript>: He or she or she.

00:38:59
<transcript>: jo pen

00:39:00
jenswoeste: if got an m1 max with 64gb - I will try this out

00:39:01
<transcript>: Jo, Penna.

00:39:06
<transcript>: Bleeding. A chef.

00:39:06
<transcript>: repos based

00:39:09
<transcript>: Repos based on a repo based on another EPO.

00:39:19
<transcript>: No longer my repo. This is the people who want to see Dream Booth on Stable Fusion working Wells. Repo.

00:39:26
<transcript>: Okay.

00:39:31
<transcript>: Should we just try and go through the setup and see when we get stuck in this repo.

00:39:39
<transcript>: Please know that you're waiting through the jungle.

00:39:39
<transcript>: unfreezing

00:39:42
<transcript>: Unfreezing the model takes a lot of juice.

00:39:52
<transcript>: You can now run. Oh, so they said a 100.

00:39:52
<transcript>: you can now

00:39:56
<transcript>: You can now run this on a GPU with 24GB of VRAM.

00:39:56
<transcript>: train will be

00:40:08
<transcript>: Train will be slower and you'll need to be sure this is the only program running if like myself, you don't happen to own one of those. I'm including a Jupiter Nobic. Here to help you run it on a rinted cloud computing platform. They said rented.

00:40:08
<transcript>: anyone the d

00:40:11
<transcript>: Anyone. The DHA charicle. They may they may. I don't know.

00:40:11
<transcript>: they read

00:40:14
<transcript>: They read that article. Please don't. It's awful.

00:40:14
<transcript>: but

00:40:18
<transcript>: But he basically calls the cloud renting other people's computers.

00:40:18
<transcript>: it's just such a

00:40:20
<transcript>: It's just such a gross misunderstanding.

00:40:27
<transcript>: Racquet servers are always allowed if you're only needing.

00:40:27
<transcript>: it

00:40:29
<transcript>: It once you can.

00:40:29
<transcript>: only run

00:40:35
<transcript>: Only run stable fusion on your M One Mac, though you'll not be able to render high res images.

00:40:38
stroopwafel26: also*

00:40:39
<transcript>: So, what are you saying? I can't render how res images. Why.

00:40:39
<transcript>: if you got an

00:40:45
<transcript>: If you got an M one Max with 64GB, you'll try this out. Oh, you've got one.

00:40:55
stroopwafel26: for high res images you need a lot more vRAM

00:41:00
<transcript>: Doesn't be an easy way to train two subjects. Insective. That's okay.

00:41:12
<transcript>: So RunPod instructions.

00:41:17
<transcript>: Click the pull so this is for running it.

00:41:17
<transcript>: in

00:41:19
<transcript>: In various cloud apps.

00:41:30
<transcript>: I think we've just build this out. I think we just build out our own.

00:41:33
<transcript>: Cloud infrastructure to do this.

00:41:38
<transcript>: I'm gonna want to do this a lot extra dream booth.

00:41:40
<transcript>: And.

00:41:40
nullchefo: @stroopwafel26 the gpu can utilise 64GB of VRAM because it is shared

00:41:46
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow narco.

00:41:53
stroopwafel26: there's a lot more to it then just vRAM

00:41:54
<transcript>: Okay. So the GPU can utilize 64GB of Ram, a VRAM because it is shared. Okay.

00:41:54
<transcript>: you need

00:41:59
<transcript>: You need a lot more Vroom? I've got 64 gigs. Is that enough? Is that a lot.

00:42:19
<transcript>: Mistake people make prompting with just your token ie Joe Penn instead of Joe Pentaperson. Be trained with Joe Penna under the class person. The model should only know your face as Joe pentaperson.

00:42:19
<transcript>: example props

00:42:25
<transcript>: Example. Props incorrect. Missing person. Following Joe Pinna portrait photograph of Joe Penna 35 millimeter films. Glass.

00:42:25
<transcript>: but you

00:42:28
<transcript>: But you got to say Joe Penna, person.

00:42:30
<transcript>: Okay.

00:42:38
<transcript>: Currently iterations of Dream Booth overtrained that token so much that it bleeds into that token. Okay.

00:42:38
<transcript>: be careful

00:42:51
<transcript>: Be careful with the types of images you train while training. Stable diffusion doesn't know that you're a person. It's just going to mimic what it sees. So these are your training images or if wait. So if these are your training images, look like this.

00:43:04
<transcript>: Oh, so it's like the same background than all the it's gonna Leach into your photos or something. I'm guessing you're only going to get generations view outside next to a spiky tree wearing a white and Gray shirt. Okay, so varied training data makes sense.

00:43:09
<transcript>: And not looking like you train longer or get better training images.

00:43:09
<transcript>: okay

00:43:11
<transcript>: Okay, Let's.

00:43:11
<transcript>: oh

00:43:13
<transcript>: Oh, there's a discord.

00:43:20
<transcript>: Hugging Facetofusers Alternate Option Dream Boost is now supported and Hugging Face fusers for training with Stable fusion.

00:43:23
<transcript>: There's so many options here.

00:43:23
<transcript>: i want to

00:43:30
<transcript>: I want to I want to know how to run it on my own machine, because then I want to know how I can run it elsewhere. You know, I'm saying.

00:43:30
stroopwafel26: SD is loads of fun :P

00:43:37
<transcript>: And these sound like cloud based like Webbased Notebooks or something.

00:43:41
<transcript>: So I'm not excited about those.

00:43:44
<transcript>: Right.

00:43:52
<transcript>: And I wonder how this one differs from this other.

00:43:58
<transcript>: We had another one. Right? This one. Dream booth on Stable Shoes. I wonder how these differ.

00:44:01
<transcript>: I mean aside from one has more stars.

00:44:18
<transcript>: What do we think? People? What do we think? I know. This is what then is using so that does bias me towards it.

00:44:20
stroopwafel26: 512x512 images take about 20 secs to generate on an RTX 3080 for reference

00:44:31
<transcript>: There's a lot more to it than just VRAM.

00:44:31
<transcript>: subdivision

00:44:45
<transcript>: Subdivision loads of fun. 512 by 512 images take about 20 seconds to generate our RTX 30 80 for reference. Okay, so how long does training takes? Droop. Like, I guess you have have you done any Dream Booth training? Because I guess this would be specifically Dream Booth training.

00:44:52
<transcript>: This one definitely has more instruction on setting up locally.

00:45:04
<transcript>: The original Saber Shoution repo to Fine Tuna statement. Let's join this discord for one thing, let's just join here.

00:45:07
stroopwafel26: Dreambooth is new for me, but I did work with training models on a bunch of hardware yeah

00:45:12
<transcript>: Leaking things? Leaking things.

00:45:12
<transcript>: fuzzy

00:45:15
<transcript>: Fuzzy, we're fuzzy.

00:45:18
<transcript>: Did it work.

00:45:20
<transcript>: No.

00:45:20
<transcript>: did not

00:45:23
thewhity: excuse me, what software are you using for streaming? thanks

00:45:23
<transcript>: Did not work the fuzzy button.

00:45:26
<transcript>: Why does my fuzzy button not working.

00:45:33
<transcript>: There's, Fuzzy. Okay, let's just see here. I want to join Stable Fusion Dream booth.

00:45:39
<transcript>: The Whitey. Welcome to Chat. What software are you using for streaming.

00:45:39
<transcript>: it's ob

00:45:40
<transcript>: It's OBS.

00:45:40
<transcript>: i'm using

00:45:43
<transcript>: I'm using OBS.

00:45:46
<transcript>: Okay. Is there a way. Let's see.

00:45:46
<transcript>: i'm gonna make

00:45:49
<transcript>: I'm gonna make this the only thing.

00:45:51
<transcript>: Now I'm gonna bring it over here.

00:45:53
<transcript>: Desktop.

00:45:53
<transcript>: three

00:45:55
<transcript>: Three. Set, four. Right here.

00:45:57
<transcript>: And then.

00:46:02
<transcript>: How much am I gonna be leaking? If I pull this up, I guess you'll just see, like.

00:46:02
<transcript>: all

00:46:06
<transcript>: All of my channels. I'm in. I don't care.

00:46:08
<transcript>: Don't care about that.

00:46:11
<transcript>: Go figure out what my fuzzy Button's not working.

00:46:14
<transcript>: Oh Topics topic.

00:46:14
<transcript>: top

00:46:16
<transcript>: Topic.

00:46:21
<transcript>: Setting up.

00:46:26
<transcript>: Diffusion.

00:46:26
<transcript>: with

00:46:27
<transcript>: With.

00:46:30
adamdotdev: !topic setting up stablediffusion and dreambooth

00:46:30
<transcript>: And Dream boost.

00:46:33
<transcript>: Okay.

00:46:38
grasp5533: your keyboard sounds so satisfying

00:46:40
<transcript>: Please read through these tips here before training, prompting asking for help.

00:46:43
<transcript>: Hey, Everyone. First of all, thanks.

00:46:57
<transcript>: The most important things.

00:47:06
<transcript>: Yeah, we're already read the number one mistake.

00:47:10
<transcript>: Training AI models takes a little.

00:47:18
<transcript>: Gpu takes a lot of electricity experiment of course, but start by carefully reading the instructions following the best practices. It's not warm up our planet for nothing.

00:47:26
<transcript>: Okay, we read the careful with the training we need to get to like, set up.

00:47:29
<transcript>: Hosted service.

00:47:39
<transcript>: I don't want to build a thing for hosting it if it already exists. You know, I'm saying.

00:47:51
<transcript>: But I do think just a nice UI where you drag training images and you get portraits and various styles. I think that's the thing that needs to exist.

00:47:57
<transcript>: I don't know how expensive that is to run. Wow, this is. This is a big channel.

00:48:04
<transcript>: So what is this channel? I'm just trying to understand what they mean by hosted.

00:48:06
<transcript>: Service.

00:48:10
<transcript>: Pen, messages.

00:48:13
<transcript>: Search for fine tuning.

00:48:15
w3barsi: check the pinned and threads on the channel

00:48:18
<transcript>: So, what is this.

00:48:18
<transcript>: taylor made ad

00:48:20
<transcript>: Taylor Made Ad. Let's see.

00:48:20
<transcript>: start creating

00:48:23
<transcript>: Start creating unique images.

00:48:26
<transcript>: Does this do dream booth.

00:48:31
<transcript>: Yeah, basically.

00:48:35
<transcript>: So this is like a hosted Dream Booth thing. Try it now.

00:48:37
<transcript>: Does this work.

00:48:43
<transcript>: Let's try.

00:48:49
<transcript>: Put 20 portrait photos your subject. Oh, look, it does exist.

00:48:50
<transcript>: It does exist.

00:48:53
<transcript>: Fine Tune credit for $3.

00:48:55
<transcript>: Few details.

00:48:58
<transcript>: Processing to take 90 minutes.

00:49:02
<transcript>: Start generating.

00:49:07
<transcript>: So somebody built it.

00:49:09
<transcript>: Right.

00:49:12
<transcript>: And it's based on Dream biz. Right.

00:49:21
daglee: $3?! Time to buy a 4090 gpu instead!

00:49:27
<transcript>: Let's play with it, let's train.

00:49:34
<transcript>: Let's train a thing. Okay, I better go fuzzy for this. Seems like a good idea.

00:49:34
<transcript>: on a check

00:49:36
<transcript>: On a checkout page.

00:49:46
stroopwafel26: I wish a 4090 was just $3

00:49:46
<transcript>: And.

00:49:53
stroopwafel26: hell I wish it was $1000 :P

00:50:00
<transcript>: Keyboard sounds so satisfying. Thanks so much grass.

00:50:00
<transcript>: i think

00:50:08
<transcript>: I think it's half the keyboard, half the mic. If I'm being honest, I mean, the keyboard does sound amazing, but the mic helps.

00:50:11
<transcript>: Okay. I can unfuzzy now.

00:50:15
<transcript>: I really wish my button was working okay title.

00:50:18
<transcript>: Let's do.

00:50:26
<transcript>: New fine tune. They call it a fine tune. So this is gonna be whoever the person is.

00:50:29
<transcript>: Okay.

00:50:32
xhyobu: What does dreambooth add to stable diffusion?

00:50:32
<transcript>: I'm gonna do an athlete.

00:50:35
<transcript>: Let's do.

00:50:40
<transcript>: Famous athlete.

00:50:43
<transcript>: So let's go to Samus.

00:50:50
<transcript>: See, Anthony Edwards, Patrick Mahomes, Donna Mitchell, Josh Jacobs.

<transcript>: somebody really

00:50:52

<transcript>: Is LeBron still famous? Surely.

00:51:05
<transcript>: Lebron James.

00:51:08
<transcript>: Class name.

00:51:08
<transcript>: man

00:51:09
<transcript>: Man.

00:51:16
<transcript>: Okay, so we just need files. We need photos of LeBron James. Should be easy. Right.

00:51:19
whysodankness: Marshawn Lynch  -" im only here so i don't get fined"

00:51:19
<transcript>: Should be pretty easy.

00:51:23
<transcript>: Ideally, not all just in Lakers jerseys.

00:51:26
<transcript>: Ideally some variety.

00:51:33
<transcript>: I'll tell you how we can do that we can say LeBron James, fashion.

00:51:33
<transcript>: and we'll get

00:51:38
<transcript>: And we'll get some not basketball dirties, right? Yeah. New. It Newit.

00:51:38
<transcript>: all right

00:51:39
<transcript>: All right.

00:51:39
<transcript>: copy

00:51:41
<transcript>: Copy.

00:51:46
<transcript>: No, I didn't want to do that. Nope. I didn't want to do that.

00:51:50
<transcript>: Let's see, how am I uploading them.

00:51:53
<transcript>: Choose files, so I just need to download them all. Okay.

00:51:56
<transcript>: Save image.

00:51:56
<transcript>: is that

00:52:00
<transcript>: Is that too little of his face and too much of everything else.

00:52:04
<transcript>: I don't know if Web P is gonna work.

00:52:08
<transcript>: Webp.

00:52:08
<transcript>: should i

00:52:10
<transcript>: Should I take a screenshot.

00:52:12
<transcript>: I'll take a screenshot.

00:52:17
<transcript>: I don't know dilute Fidelity that way.

00:52:23
<transcript>: There's one.

00:52:26
<transcript>: Glasses. Probably not.

00:52:38
<transcript>: Everybody track them for we're doing here. We're just using this paid service. Marshall Lynch. I'm only here. So don't get fine. I love it. I love it so much.

00:52:38
<transcript>: welcome

00:52:58
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Hey, Yo Boo, what is Dream Booth at Disabled Fusion? It adds, like, really good take a face or a subject of some sort and place it in different settings. So I don't know how well stable diffusion handles that scenario. But Dream Booth is tailored towards I want to take a thing like a person, and I'm gonna put them into all kinds.

00:52:58
<transcript>: of different set

00:53:02
<transcript>: Of different settings so like porches of them and various styles.

00:53:05
<transcript>: I can get a little higher resolution here.

00:53:05
<transcript>: are these

00:53:09
<transcript>: Are these supposed to be 512 by 512? I hope not.

00:53:09
<transcript>: because i'm not

00:53:11
<transcript>: Because I'm not doing that. Are they 512.

00:53:21
<transcript>: Images should include subject different variations, expressions, poses, backgrounds opposite of threes can go to your photo's amps look photos from different times no nude. So do I need.

00:53:25
<transcript>: Steps so we do more.

00:53:26
xhyobu: Got it

00:53:27
<transcript>: We'll get there.

00:53:27
<transcript>: only

00:53:38
<transcript>: Only use if you know what you're doing. I don't know what I'm doing, so I do want to make sure I do enough steps. It might take longer. This might be a later today we see how this one turned out. And then we try and set it up on my machine while we're waiting.

00:53:48
<transcript>: Yeah, it doesn't say like file size requirements. Right.

00:53:50
<transcript>: So we'll go with.

00:53:56
<transcript>: So it's got a lot with glasses on. Should I include some of glasses on? I don't know if that's a good idea.

00:53:59
<transcript>: Not sure.

00:54:05
<transcript>: There's a lot of them with glasses on, though, so maybe we include one.

00:54:13
<transcript>: If space jam happening, is there another space jam coming? Sorry, I'm asking an audience. It may not care at all.

00:54:19
2dorkstv: I really hope not

00:54:20
<transcript>: But I watched the original Space Jam. Michael Jordan, anybody.

00:54:23
daglee: Space jam 2 happened

00:54:24
grasp5533: The second one already came out

00:54:25
<transcript>: And I know he was like, doing another one, right.

00:54:25
<transcript>: same with an afro

00:54:27
2dorkstv: Space Jam was awesome. Space Jam 2 was ... something else

00:54:27
techdebtninja: It already came out

00:54:28
<transcript>: Same with an Afro. No, that's not an Afro. That's a hat.

00:54:29
daglee: space jam 2 was horrible

00:54:35
<transcript>: Don't mind me just making.

00:54:37
daglee: I didn't even finish it.

00:54:38
<transcript>: Stable diffusion.

00:54:38
<transcript>: create lebr

00:54:39
techdebtninja: My kids enjoyed it

00:54:40
<transcript>: Create LeBron James images.

00:54:44
2dorkstv: same, @daglee

00:54:46
<transcript>: Nothing to see here.

00:54:50
<transcript>: This is definitely the weirdest thing I've done on stream.

00:54:58
<transcript>: But also kind of fun.

00:55:00
2dorkstv: and I really love the Looney Tunes

00:55:00
<transcript>: Kind of fun.

00:55:05
<transcript>: Space Sham Two is horrible. Oh, it's already came out. Oh, I missed it.

00:55:05
<transcript>: okay

00:55:12
<transcript>: Okay. So Space Jam the original so good. And you're telling me the LeBron James version not so good.

00:55:12
<transcript>: that's

00:55:14
<transcript>: That's a bummer.

00:55:20
<transcript>: Don't want to tarnish the Space Jam brand.

00:55:21
sockthedev: do you need insane specs to run stable diffusion?

00:55:25
<transcript>: Well, it wasn't LeBron's fault, right? He's pretty good at acting, if I remember.

00:55:27
<transcript>: Not too low quality.

00:55:33
<transcript>: Fiber Call LeBron is a pretty good actor like as far as athletes go.

00:55:33
<transcript>: athletes

00:55:36
<transcript>: Athletes are not typically great actors.

00:55:36
<transcript>: and i want to say

00:55:38
<transcript>: And I want to say.

00:55:38
<transcript>: lebron

00:55:39
<transcript>: Lebron's pretty good.

00:55:49
jenswoeste: watched it with the kids. I blame daffy duck

00:55:50
<transcript>: We are getting LeBrons face.

00:55:58
<transcript>: And teaching the robot's how to make more of LeBron. We're gonna have like, Fortnite LeBron. We're gonna have.

00:55:58
<transcript>: all kinds of

00:55:58
daglee: He wasn't amazing at acting. But that wasn't the biggest problem. It just wasn't funny, at all.

00:56:00
<transcript>: All kinds of LeBrons, right.

00:56:03
<transcript>: Good time.

00:56:16
<transcript>: It doesn't say that to be square, does it.

00:56:16
<transcript>: i don't think that

00:56:18
<transcript>: I don't think that'd be square.

00:56:22
<transcript>: The problem with the mask probably not helpful.

00:56:25
2dorkstv: yeah, I don't think there's a single element that broke Space Jam 2. It was just messy overall

00:56:25
stroopwafel26: @sockthedev pretty much

00:56:25
<transcript>: I'm gonna say that's probably not helpful.

00:56:32
<transcript>: The glasses, though I feel like if I don't include glasses, I'm cutting out like half of his photos.

00:56:38
pajama_cam: there already is a fortnite lebron because of space jam 2 :D

00:56:41
<transcript>: Okay. Here's a different angle. This seems good.

00:56:53
<transcript>: Now let's get some of him in his like normal basketball setting.

00:56:53
<transcript>: i don't need to have

00:56:55
<transcript>: I don't need to have none.

00:56:58
<transcript>: There's a nice.

00:57:01
<transcript>: Transparent. I don't know. Will that be okay.

00:57:01
<transcript>: will that work

00:57:03
<transcript>: Will that work.

00:57:08
<transcript>: I don't know.

00:57:13
<transcript>: How many am I at? Anybody.

00:57:15
<transcript>: Don't know.

00:57:20
<transcript>: We've got a few.

00:57:24
<transcript>: I guess I can start uploading these choose files.

00:57:27
<transcript>: And desktop.

00:57:34
<transcript>: Click that mini so far that's not very many. We need to do a lot more. That's nine.

00:57:34
<transcript>: need a double

00:57:35
<transcript>: Need a double it.

00:57:42
<transcript>: He wasn't amazing and acting. But that wasn't the biggest problem. It just wasn't funny at all. That's a bummer.

00:57:42
<transcript>: you blame

00:57:44
<transcript>: You blame death. He duck.

00:58:01
<transcript>: Sock the Dev. I think I think what we've gathered is you need to have a pretty good GPU with a lot of VRAM. I'm saying things like I know what they mean. Pajama Cam, welcome to Chat. There are already is a fortnight LeBron because of space sham two. Oh, is there really.

00:58:04
<transcript>: Fortnite.

00:58:09
<transcript>: Lebron James. Oh, is this already a thing? Are you kidding me.

00:58:13
<transcript>: Already is a fortnight. Lebron. Well, there you go.

00:58:13
<transcript>: should have chosen

00:58:17
<transcript>: Should have chosen somebody that doesn't already have that is all at all like him.

00:58:19
<transcript>: That does.

00:58:22
<transcript>: Well, we're still gonna do LeBron.

00:58:22
<transcript>: i just

00:58:28
<transcript>: I just feel like he's he's a very iconic athlete, you know, I'm looking for.

00:58:28
<transcript>: iconic

00:58:29
<transcript>: Iconic.

00:58:37
<transcript>: And maybe he just ages me. Maybe LeBron's no longer I caught. Maybe this is like.

00:58:37
<transcript>: a millennial

00:58:44
<transcript>: A Millennials iconic athlete. I don't know who's iconic. Now. I guess this is a very international audience.

00:58:44
<transcript>: you

00:58:49
<transcript>: You all would say, like, Reinaldo or something? Who would you say, who's, who's, like, the most famous athlete.

<transcript>: What's another context? We could get LeBron James acting? I don't know.

01:02:21
<transcript>: How's this face.

01:02:27
<transcript>: Is that light blown us? That's just terrible quality.

01:02:31
<transcript>: Here's. Him. Ice hat. Let's do that.

01:02:39
<transcript>: Do you think I could pull this outfit off? What do you think.

01:02:40
jenswoeste: so if youre a signature hunter, book a room at the four seasons that week LUL

01:02:41
nullchefo: @stroopwafel26 Is there something wrong about that

01:02:44
<transcript>: US GP had a record breaking amount of spectators.

01:02:48
<transcript>: Max Verse stappin.

01:02:53
<transcript>: I don't know who that is, either. Wow, I don't know anything. Oh, F one.

01:02:53
<transcript>: okay maybe

01:03:03
<transcript>: Okay. Maybe there's a it might be up, not be up and coming. I don't know. I'm just not very up and coming. So I don't know a lot of things. You're from Europe. Never heard of them.

01:03:23
<transcript>: If you don't know about Lewis Hamilton is a European, you must live under a rock. Every year. First week of January, we had our sales conference that the four seasons in San Francisco, Lakers were often staying there because of the game with warriors. And yeah, in San Francisco, that's who it would be. And four seasons and SF had a full size and be a court for training purposes. So if you're.

01:03:23
<transcript>: sign

01:03:27
<transcript>: Signature Hunter Book A Room With More Seasons that week.

01:03:28
<transcript>: That's funny.

01:03:36
<transcript>: All right, I think we're getting close to 20.

01:03:39
<transcript>: Turns out finding 20 photos even if LeBron James.

01:03:49
<transcript>: Hard like 20 photos that you think will be good for training purposes. So I guess that's the barrier here. You wanna you want to make a model of your own thing.

01:03:49
<transcript>: gotta have

01:03:50
<transcript>: Gotta have 20 good photos.

01:03:53
crimsonxxmana: There's Tyson Fury too.

01:03:53
theruggedbear: imagine finding 20 good photos of yourself

01:03:55
<transcript>: I guess we have in our camera reels. I guess we have 20 photos of ourselves.

01:03:58
<transcript>: Maybe that's not a big deal.

01:04:07
<transcript>: I think I need one more.

01:04:11
<transcript>: I think just one more.

01:04:16
<transcript>: All right.

01:04:20
<transcript>: Upload.

01:04:24
<transcript>: Gonna wait for that last one.

01:04:27
<transcript>: Here we go 20.

01:04:30
<transcript>: 22.

01:04:31
jenswoeste: you should start with a service where you ask an ai to get <x> pictures online of <person>

01:04:35
<transcript>: Anything between four and 30. Okay. Cool. So we're gonna do 60 steps.

01:04:35
<transcript>: create

01:04:40
<transcript>: Create? I don't know we good LeBron LeBron James. Here we go, here we go.

01:04:40
<transcript>: should the title

01:04:42
<transcript>: Should the title be the lowercase.

01:04:57
<transcript>: So this should go off and do its thing. And then we'll try and install locally and check on this later. Right.

01:04:59
<transcript>: Oh, wait, wait. We're supposed to do more here.

01:05:05
<transcript>: Lebron James.

01:05:13
<transcript>: Try searching for prompt and inspiration on Lexica.

01:05:20
<transcript>: So what is this? I'm not supposed to be able to do this yet. Right.

01:05:22
<transcript>: They need to train it right.

01:05:23
daglee: I don't watch much sports these days. I watch more esports than normal sports.

01:05:30
<transcript>: Holy Cat, look at these props.

01:05:30
<transcript>: there is

01:05:32
<transcript>: There is something to the prompts.

01:05:36
<transcript>: You see this.

01:05:39
<transcript>: What in the world.

01:05:51

fossabot: working on awguess

01:05:52
neochromer: hello hello

01:05:56
neochromer: how is the neovim journey going

01:05:57
stroopwafel26: TIL this LeBron dude is pretty photogenic

01:05:58
neochromer: long time no see :D

01:06:00
<transcript>: I don't think I can actually generate images yet we can try, I guess.

01:06:08
daglee: Now we take a 8 hours break?

01:06:09
<transcript>: Tyson Fury. Who's that? Welcome to Chat. Crimson.

01:06:19
<transcript>: Yeah. Imagine finding 20 could pose yourself. Exactly. Start with the service where you ask an AI to get X pictures online of person. Yeah. No kidding.

01:06:19
<transcript>: that's

01:06:23
<transcript>: That's like part of the Tour is just coming up with 20 good trainings. That is.

01:06:26
crimsonxxmana: He's a boxer. LUL

01:06:29
<transcript>: Watch more esports than normal sports? Dagly? What esports do you watch.

01:06:41
<transcript>: We are totally not working on AW, guess neocromer. So the Neo the Neil Vim journey is going well. Thanks and follow Tan Tom, Fran.

01:06:41
<transcript>: and maybe we

01:06:48
<transcript>: And maybe we will do something where we need some text editor out. I do feel like typing today.

01:06:48
<transcript>: a long time

01:06:50
<transcript>: A long time to see.

01:06:53
<transcript>: Now we take an 8 hours break.

01:06:56
<transcript>: No, no.

01:06:59
<transcript>: I just don't know let's see.

01:07:01
<transcript>: I'm supposed to take.

01:07:06
<transcript>: So many things to learn here.

01:07:09
<transcript>: So let's take one of these.

01:07:11
<transcript>: And put it in here.

01:07:13
daglee: dota2, starcraft and quake mostly.

01:07:14
<transcript>: And get something out of it.

01:07:17
<transcript>: I don't think that's gonna work.

01:07:21
crimsonxxmana: He has an energy drink now.

01:07:21
<transcript>: Oh, what just happened? I Typed that in.

01:07:21
<transcript>: i hit gener

01:07:23
<transcript>: I hit generate image.

01:07:23
<transcript>: it did

01:07:26
<transcript>: It did nothing, right.

01:07:32
<transcript>: So here is my. Oh, here we go. Eta 117 minutes. Cool. Okay.

01:07:38
<transcript>: So let's try and get this running on our own machine. So we're not waiting on cloud service.

01:07:46
<transcript>: Maybe my in one will be so fast.

01:07:57
stroopwafel26: adamdo8Adambar adamdo8Adambar adamdo8Adambar adamdo8Adambar adamdo8Adambar

01:08:43
stroopwafel26: oh man, starcraft, all the feels

01:08:45
<transcript>: Okay. So I'm supposed to set up.

01:08:45
<transcript>: the

01:08:47
<transcript>: The LDM, environment.

01:08:51
<transcript>: The original stable diffusion repo.

01:08:58
<transcript>: Just do this.

01:09:40
uberrick: Larabarr

01:09:45
<transcript>: Okay.

01:09:49
uberrick: Hey, how are things Adam?

01:09:54
<transcript>: This one.

<transcript>: Just open it in Kitty.

01:10:34
<transcript>: I want to see what they said. There.

01:10:42
<transcript>: Bash. Okay, they just ran it.

01:10:45
<transcript>: So I'm just gonna run it.

01:10:50
<transcript>: Okay.

01:10:52
<transcript>: Yes.

01:10:58
<transcript>: You're at a mini ports. Three. Sounds good.

01:11:06
<transcript>: Uber is here. Things are good.

01:11:12
<transcript>: Uber Rick we are playing with stable diffusion and dream booth we're gonna try and create some.

01:11:16
<transcript>: Dream boosts.

01:11:16
<transcript>: oh see

01:11:21
<transcript>: Oh, see? What do you want to do is installer to initialize mini forge. Yes.

01:11:25
<transcript>: Is it done.

01:11:27
<transcript>: Thank you.

01:11:32
uberrick: ah nice, is that was levels has been using in his latest project?

01:11:34
<transcript>: Okay. So let's open.

01:11:34
<transcript>: something

01:11:36
<transcript>: Something our.

01:11:36
<transcript>: alacrity

01:11:37
<transcript>: Alacrity.

01:11:37
<transcript>: i'm gonna

01:11:39
<transcript>: I'm gonna do.

01:11:42
uberrick: what*

01:11:43
<transcript>: Bring a new alacrity over here.

01:11:46
<transcript>: Yeah. So we're gonna try and create some.

01:11:51
<transcript>: Cool Portraits of professional athletes.

01:11:51
<transcript>: for stack

01:11:53
<transcript>: For Stack news.

01:12:04
<transcript>: Is that what Levels has been using in this latest project? Oh, I actually don't know. I've seen it's like the it's like an AI decoration thing, right? Like interior design or something. I don't know if he's using Dream booth.

01:12:09
<transcript>: I'm sure he's using stable defusion. Well, I'm not sure, but I think so.

01:12:09
<transcript>: condu

01:12:11
<transcript>: Conduct.

01:12:11
<transcript>: it works

01:12:13
<transcript>: It works. Okay.

01:12:18
<transcript>: On the repo repo. I've used Lincoln Steinfork of Stable diffusion.

01:12:23
<transcript>: Is that what I want.

01:12:27
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:12:34
<transcript>: Let's see we're going back. I gotta think sure I'm following the same instructions. So.

01:12:39
<transcript>: Need to obtain this pre trained symbolic fusion models falling there instructions.

01:12:43
<transcript>: Waits can be downloaded on Hugging face.

01:12:54
<transcript>: Okay.

01:13:00
<transcript>: Convince organization hugging face.

01:13:05
<transcript>: facebook

01:13:06
<transcript>: Facebook.

01:13:20
<transcript>: So these are the models that I have to download, right.

01:13:22
<transcript>: Comp vis.

01:13:25
<transcript>: visible diffusion model

01:13:25
<transcript>: visible diffusion models find

01:13:27
<transcript>: Visible diffusion models find their instructions where you can be downloaded.

01:13:33
<transcript>: They're using simply viewing version one full or four full EMA.

01:13:35
<transcript>: Okay.

01:13:43
<transcript>: The stuff is so cool.

01:13:47
<transcript>: Also so much the Wild West.

01:13:55
<transcript>: Is that the weight that might be the weights.

01:13:58
<transcript>: And that's the checkpoint.

01:14:07
<transcript>: That must be from oh, here we go.

01:14:16
<transcript>: I gotta pick a checkpoint people.

01:14:16
<transcript>: version one

01:14:18
<transcript>: Version one.

01:14:18
<transcript>: version

01:14:22
<transcript>: Version one, two, version one, three, version one, four. I guess we've used the latest, right.

01:14:27
<transcript>: I'm guessing we will this one.

01:14:35
<transcript>: Now, how do I download it.

01:14:43
<transcript>: I need the explain. It like I'm five stable diffusion. Let's see.

01:14:54
dyalicode: hello

01:14:56
dyalicode: how are u

01:15:03
<transcript>: Okay, so that we prepare over the following checkpoints.

01:15:03
<transcript>: am i just

01:15:05
<transcript>: Am I just cloning this whole repo.

01:15:10
<transcript>: Link them.

01:15:12
<transcript>: So we're.

01:15:19
uberrick: Need a youtube link in your bio, looking forward to your next vids on AWS

01:15:21
<transcript>: Did they have an step one. Here we go. Suitable condition named LDM can be created with an activated width. Okay, here we go.

01:15:24
<transcript>: So I need to download.

01:15:24
<transcript>: upd

01:15:27
<transcript>: Update an existing latent fusion environment environment. We're running.

01:15:34
<transcript>: I am so in over my head, but we're gonna figure this out.

01:15:41
<transcript>: So I guess this is the one, the one that I'm gonna clone.

01:15:48
<transcript>: And then environment. Yaml is that yeah. Right there. Okay. Cool. Okay. This is making sense.

01:16:02
<transcript>: Also need to create a set of images for regularization as a fine tuning algorithm of Dreamboard is required that details of the algorithm can be found in the paper.

01:16:08
beardage: LOL I did the same exact thing looking at this repo "oh lawd someone write me a medium article to read"

01:16:08
<transcript>: I have a dinner address, set of regularization images before the training.

01:16:23
<transcript>: Wow. Okay, I generate eight images for egos, but more regularization image may lead to stronger, regularization and better editability. After that, save the generated images separately. One image per PNG file at regularization images.

01:16:34
<transcript>: We should definitely use more images for regularization. Please try 100 or 200 to better align with the original paper. I shorten the repeat of Reg data set in a config file. Geez.

01:16:38
<transcript>: I love stuff like this.

01:16:43
<transcript>: Let's see. Hello? Dialog? I'm good. How are you.

01:16:47
<transcript>: Need a YouTube link in your bio? Oh, Geez, Yes.

01:16:47
<transcript>: i

01:16:50
<transcript>: I'm on YouTube. Now. I'm a YouTuber.

01:16:50
<transcript>: a youtube

<transcript>: The channel.

01:16:57
stroopwafel26: @adamdotdev you have your computer specs up, the serial # is in view, you probably should keep that one a little secret

01:16:58
<transcript>: Oh, mute.

01:16:58
<transcript>: how do i do this

01:17:01
<transcript>: How do I do this edit? I want to edit my links.

<transcript>: Let's go to creater dashboard.

01:17:17
<transcript>: Do that off screen. Uhoh.

01:17:21
<transcript>: Oh.

01:17:24
<transcript>: My serial numbers not good to show Oops.

<transcript>: sorry

01:17:30
<transcript>: Sorry about that. Yeah. Uber, all. Rick, I'll have another video out this week.

01:17:32
<transcript>: It's not about AWS, though.

01:17:39
<transcript>: It's not next JS, because next year's. Comp who's hyped what am I looking for.

01:17:41
netfrazier: no incase there are some things you don't want to show

01:17:41
<transcript>: What am I looking for.

01:17:43
<transcript>: I'm looking for.

01:17:43
<transcript>: the

01:18:12
<transcript>: I think.

01:18:18
<transcript>: We'll move this up Twitter and YouTube. Oh.

01:18:21
<transcript>: Should have saved that first.

01:18:25
<transcript>: Youtube.

01:18:30
<transcript>: Cool now I YouTube is on my Twitch profile. Seems like a good idea.

01:18:35
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah. So I have a video out. It's a video on YouTube.

01:18:35
<transcript>: of me

01:18:37
<transcript>: Of me talking a lot.

01:18:41
<transcript>: What did I download minifiers for.

01:18:41
<transcript>: i need

01:18:46
stroopwafel26: it's a very good video on youtube

01:18:47
<transcript>: I need to stick to one set of instructions. Oh, yeah, yeah. This is a set of instructions I was using, isn't it.

01:18:51
<transcript>: Yeah. So we downloaded Mini forge.

01:18:59
<transcript>: Now we need to clone the Repo. Why do they use the Lincoln? Steinfork.

01:19:02
<transcript>: Anyone know.

01:19:14
<transcript>: It's not.

01:19:14
<transcript>: called stable

01:19:16
<transcript>: Called stable diffusion, apparently.

01:19:16
<transcript>: did he rename

01:19:18
<transcript>: Did he rename the fork.

01:19:22
<transcript>: What.

01:19:22
<transcript>: the version

01:19:26
<transcript>: The Version this version of Stable Diffusion features a slick Web GUI.

01:19:26
<transcript>: an interactive

01:19:28
<transcript>: An interactive command line screen.

01:19:28
<transcript>: okay so

01:19:29
<transcript>: Okay. So this is what.

01:19:29
<transcript>: this person

01:19:33
<transcript>: This person was using, I don't know. Don't use this.

01:19:34
uberrick: Do you know if Lincoln is an actual person or was he generated?

01:19:39
<transcript>: Various new features and options to aid the image generation process.

01:19:45
<transcript>: As I polished Web Unit interface.

01:19:50
<transcript>: And pretty active six days ago.

01:19:53
<transcript>: Five days ago. Four days ago. Yeah. Okay.

01:19:56
<transcript>: Seems good.

01:19:58
<transcript>: What do we think.

01:20:01
<transcript>: Do you want to use this one.

01:20:05
<transcript>: Okay.

01:20:08
<transcript>: And we're gonna be using.

01:20:11
<transcript>: Dream booth.

01:20:16
<transcript>: Know if.

01:20:22
<transcript>: That's gonna play nicely.

01:20:25
<transcript>: Dream Booth support.

01:20:39
beardage: this guy githubs

01:20:40
<transcript>: May better preserve the character.

01:20:49
<transcript>: Yeah. I can't do things like taking finetune models.

01:21:12
<transcript>: What is Ti? Am. I know what Ti is.

01:21:24
<transcript>: Collabs.

01:21:35
<transcript>: Yeah. I want to run this whole thing locally. I'm bent. I'm bent on that goal.

01:21:35
<transcript>: discuss

01:21:36
<transcript>: Discussion.

01:22:00
<transcript>: Okay, so this is actually a fork of stable diffusion. I didn't catch that.

01:22:11
<transcript>: So.

01:22:11
<transcript>: this is what

01:22:23
<transcript>: This is what we were kind of following. I think this is what I should keep going down the path with this repo. Am I actually. Yeah. Environment. I am. Well, so this is a fork of stable fusion. Okay. Okay.

01:22:27
<transcript>: So I'm gonna clone this thing.

01:22:29
<transcript>: Let's do it.

01:22:32
<transcript>: Let's go to.

01:22:35
<transcript>: Playground.

01:22:39
<transcript>: Let's go make Dir.

01:22:39
<transcript>: dirty

01:22:43
<transcript>: Dirty Fuse, or call Dream Booth. This is more specifically.

01:22:43
<transcript>: dream boost

01:22:45
<transcript>: Dream boost.

01:22:48
<transcript>: Okay.

01:23:05
<transcript>: Let's say we want to get clone.

01:23:08
<transcript>: This thing.

01:23:11
<transcript>: Dream Booth Stable diffusion.

01:23:13
<transcript>: Okay.

01:23:16
<transcript>: A dream build.

01:23:21
<transcript>: Okay. Now we're in.

01:23:25
<transcript>: A Directory that has that environment. Yaml.

01:23:25
<transcript>: so

01:23:27
<transcript>: So now theoretically.

01:23:27
<transcript>: we should be able

01:23:29
<transcript>: We should be able to do.

01:23:35
<transcript>: Which set of instructions? Was it that I saw that environment? Yaml.

01:23:35

01:23:53
<transcript>: Here.

01:23:53
<transcript>: conda

01:23:57
<transcript>: Conda environment create or maybe we are actually we're creating an environment with this.

01:24:02
<transcript>: Because we have this environment YAML file now right.

01:24:10
<transcript>: Do that off screen. Welcome to Chat. Net. Fraser.

01:24:15
<transcript>: No in case there are something you don't want to show.

01:24:30
<transcript>: Wish you were going to next Conf beardage. Me too. I always get FOMO this time of year. I mean, this time of a conference is hype cycle like everywhere showing up in San Francisco right now. And I'm like, I kind of wish I was there. And I don't even like traveling.

01:24:30
<transcript>: but

01:24:31
<transcript>: But it's like I.

01:24:39
<transcript>: It's a very good video on YouTube. What is Stroop.

01:24:57
dyalicode: @adamdotdev i subscribe in ur youtube channel

01:24:57
<transcript>: Environment name not found that's not good.

01:25:14
2dorkstv: yeah, i really dug that AWS video. subbed :)

01:25:16
<transcript>: I mean, it's gonna be good production quality. Always. I don't know that anyone cares about my like.

01:25:16
<transcript>: rants

01:25:26
<transcript>: Rants about why I think people discount AWS when they shouldn't. I'm gonna try and talk about some more like web Devy things because I get it like AWS is whatever.

01:25:30
<transcript>: Dialy you subscribe to my YouTube channel. Thank you so much.

01:25:30
<transcript>: i

01:25:34
<transcript>: I really dug the atabs views thanks so much to dorks.

01:25:34
<transcript>: my

01:25:38
<transcript>: My videos are gonna be a mix of web and cloud.

01:25:38
<transcript>: and

01:25:46
<transcript>: And sometimes it'll just be nerdy web stuff like how you should use Radics Radics for building your components. Don't build components from scratch.

01:25:46
<transcript>: use

01:25:49
rohithgilla: !youtube

01:25:55
<transcript>: Use Radics that kind of stuff. Sometimes it'll be kind of front Endy like that. Sometimes it'll be you guys hate AWS for dumb reasons, and you shouldn't.

01:25:57
<transcript>: It's gonna be a mix.

01:25:57
<transcript>: so

01:26:02
<transcript>: So base. We have a base environment, but apparently it didn't work.

01:26:02
<transcript>: when i tried to

01:26:05
<transcript>: When I tried to create oh, it probably says, right here.

01:26:18
chillcrunch37: Radix search algo?

01:26:18
<transcript>: Just fix that right up.

01:26:22
<transcript>: Need to use C. Conda forge for new sensors.

01:26:22
grasp5533: I'm currently struggling to convince my company to build a data lake in the cloud.  The cloud makes them very nervous

01:26:28
<transcript>: So I need to do some installs.

01:26:35
<transcript>: I wonder if that's in some of the instructions on one of the many.

01:26:39
<transcript>: Sets of instructions I have pulled up.

01:26:44
<transcript>: Here we go update an existing late diffusion. So they're installing PyTorch. Tortvision.

01:26:50
<transcript>: I need to install some stuff.

01:26:54
<transcript>: Wow. I have so many different, like.

01:26:58
<transcript>: Somebody different sets of instructions. Up. Right.

01:26:58
<transcript>: right now we're just trying

01:27:06
<transcript>: Right now, we're just trying to do step one, set up an elitem environment, following instructions from textual inversion repo or the original stabilizer repo. So we're really trying to go through.

01:27:11
<transcript>: Like the original. Let's just go to the original state of the Tuesday. Here we go.

01:27:11
<transcript>: so

01:27:13
<transcript>: So PyTorch.

01:27:13
<transcript>: here we go

01:27:15
<transcript>: Here we go, Here we go.

01:27:20
<transcript>: Suitable comment Name Idlium. Oh, wait, yes, we just saw.

01:27:20
<transcript>: what all do i

01:27:26
<transcript>: What all do I need to install? I need to install some more things. Clearly, my machine does not have the thing on it.

01:27:28
<transcript>: I need to install them.

01:27:28
<transcript>: so can

01:27:30
<transcript>: So can someone tell me.

01:27:33
<transcript>: Which things I need to install.

01:27:33
<transcript>: hightourch

01:27:35
<transcript>: Hightourch torch vision.

01:27:44
<transcript>: Let's see. I just search this. And somebody said, Torch, audio coup toolkit. Eleven one. That's the one that was I'm missing. Eleven, three.

01:27:47
<transcript>: Let's do all of these.

01:27:54
<transcript>: Computers are fun.

01:27:59
<transcript>: So we're gonna change some things, you know what this is? What.

01:28:02
<transcript>: This is what Vim mode is for.

01:28:08
<transcript>: That's gonna be a three.

01:28:11
<transcript>: Okay.

01:28:11
<transcript>: i tor

01:28:14
<transcript>: I Torch, Torch, Vision, Torch Audio coup toolkit.

01:28:14
<transcript>: and then

01:28:21
<transcript>: And then C. Pytorch. C. Condiforge. I don't know what those do, but I'm doing them anyway.

01:28:21
<transcript>: installing

01:28:23
<transcript>: Installing them on my machine.

01:28:26
<transcript>: We did it.

01:28:26
<transcript>: did it work

01:28:27
<transcript>: Did it work.

01:28:34
<transcript>: Package is not found. The following factors are not available from current channels. Uhoh Kuda toolkit Eleven Three is not available.

01:28:34
<transcript>: i wonder if

01:28:38
<transcript>: I wonder if I still need it or if installing Pietorch and all those other things did this thing.

01:28:38
<transcript>: might have

01:28:40
<transcript>: Might have done this thing.

01:28:46
<transcript>: Kudu toolkit 11.3.

01:28:48
<transcript>: Not found.

01:28:54
<transcript>: 110.

01:29:00
<transcript>: Did this person have a problem with eleven, three.

01:29:02
<transcript>: I need specifically.

01:29:05
<transcript>: Kudi to look at eleven, three.

01:29:18
<transcript>: Why was packaged? Not found.

01:29:27
<transcript>: To search for alternate channels that may provide the contact you're looking for. Navigate to anaconda.org.

01:29:32
<transcript>: Okay. So let's find Kuda toolkit.

01:29:32
<transcript>: eleven

01:29:34
<transcript>: Eleven, three.

01:29:36
<transcript>: Here we go.

01:29:37
stroopwafel26: 11.3 isn't available anymore

01:29:40
<transcript>: Is that the problem.

01:29:43
stroopwafel26: in the repos

01:29:46
<transcript>: Mac OS Tools is that the problem is it not available for Mac OS.

01:29:50
<transcript>: No our source development or running applications on Mac OS.

01:29:52
<transcript>: Oops.

01:29:57
<transcript>: Is this the Big go.

01:30:07
<transcript>: Back OS.

01:30:12
stroopwafel26: and indeed, no cudatoolkit for macos at the moment

01:30:14
<transcript>: No longer support.

01:30:14
<transcript>: development

01:30:15
<transcript>: Development.

01:30:26
<transcript>: Or running applications on Mac OS. While there are no tools which use macOS as a target environment, Nvidia is making macOS host versions of these tools. You can lock profiling and debiling sessions for term platforms.

01:30:34
<transcript>: These don't sound like what I need.

01:30:38
<transcript>: Could GDB on the Mac OS.

01:30:41
riazey: "oh oh" indeed

01:30:45
<transcript>: Debugger front end. Like, I don't know. Do we feel like this is the thing I need.

01:30:48
<transcript>: Oh Oh.

01:30:55
stroopwafel26: compiling!

01:30:56
<transcript>: Grass. You're coming.

01:31:07
riazey: i meant to write uh oh but clearly it's too early in the morning

01:31:08
<transcript>: What makes them nervous? Grasp.

01:31:10
<transcript>: Have they said.

01:31:14
<transcript>: Like we're nervous about.

01:31:14
<transcript>: security

01:31:16
<transcript>: Security or about.

01:31:16
<transcript>: rel

01:31:18
<transcript>: Reliability.

01:31:18
<transcript>: have they said anything

01:31:20
<transcript>: Have they said anything like that.

01:31:20
grasp5533: Mostly around PII in the cloud

01:31:27
<transcript>: Meant to write a clearly in the morning. Welcome to Chat raise.

01:31:31
<transcript>: Compiling what's? Compiling? Stroop.

01:31:36
crimsonxxmana: M1 doesn't have any cuda cores to use cuda, does it?

01:31:38
<transcript>: Most around PII in the cloud so.

01:31:38
<transcript>: personal

01:31:40
<transcript>: Personal.

01:31:40
<transcript>: identifiable

01:31:47
<transcript>: Identifiable information. It's like names and email addresses and addresses. Addresses and stuff that's PII. Right.

01:31:49
<transcript>: I mean.

01:31:49
grasp5533: Yeah exactly

01:31:52
<transcript>: I would be much more concerned.

01:31:52
<transcript>: about

01:31:54
<transcript>: About PII.

01:31:54
<transcript>: in your

01:31:59
stroopwafel26: No cuda on m1

01:32:03
grasp5533: My thoughts exactly hahah

01:32:07
<transcript>: In your private cloud or wherever you're putting your stuff onprem. I'd be much more concerned about it there than in the cloud. If I'm being honest, I know your company is the one that I'm trying to convince here. You don't need convincing, but.

01:32:07
<transcript>: basically

01:32:16
<transcript>: Basically anything you do from an internal it standpoint at random company X is gonna be worse than what they do in the cloud.

01:32:18
<transcript>: Just facts.

01:32:24
<transcript>: Like there's not a single thing you're gonna do as an organization. Better.

01:32:24
<transcript>: than

01:32:27
<transcript>: Than AWS, or Google.

01:32:27
<transcript>: maybe even mic

01:32:29
<transcript>: Maybe even Microsoft.

01:32:32
<transcript>: I'm not a big as your fan.

01:32:34
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:32:39
<transcript>: In one doesn't have any coupors to use Kudos, does it? No, it doesn't.

01:32:39
<transcript>: good call

01:32:45
<transcript>: Good call. There is no CUDA on an M one. Kuda is an Nvidia thing.

01:32:45
<transcript>: so how

01:32:48
<transcript>: So how do we set up an LDM environment.

01:32:53
<transcript>: Riddle me this. How do we set up an LDM environment.

01:32:53
<transcript>: on a mac one

01:32:55
<transcript>: On a Mac, One, Mac, M, one.

01:32:57
<transcript>: In one.

01:32:57
<transcript>: okay

01:32:59
<transcript>: Okay. Has anyone.

01:33:02
<transcript>: In one.

01:33:05
sockenguy: I hope they are going to update the aws ui sometime in the future :D

01:33:06
<transcript>: Place music's good.

01:33:25
<transcript>: Possible dresser Max Silicon a bit slowly would be good to include basic setup instructions to do this.

01:33:25
<transcript>: i heard

01:33:32
<transcript>: I heard the Pi Torch updated include Apple MDS in the latest nightly release will is improved performance.

01:33:32
<transcript>: oh here we go

01:33:33
<transcript>: Oh, here we go.

01:33:35
<transcript>: Homebrew.

01:33:41
<transcript>: Oh CPU only on in one Max.

01:33:41
<transcript>: that sounds

01:33:42
<transcript>: That sounds bad.

01:33:43
crimsonxxmana: Replace all cuda with cpu. LUL

01:33:56
<transcript>: Nine minutes per image. That's not good.

01:33:58
stroopwafel26: yeah it's all CPU based on M1 :)

01:33:59
<transcript>: Mps enabled.

01:34:04
stroopwafel26: so slow

01:34:06
<transcript>: Okay. Use a Conda environment. I could not get it to work without it.

01:34:13
<transcript>: I'm not even a programmer. I'm just really good at Googleing stuff.

01:34:13
<transcript>: that's how

01:34:21
<transcript>: That's how I feel most of the time. Not really a programmer. I'm just really good at Googling stuff. Install PyTorch Knightlee Update OS X.

01:34:21
<transcript>: use

01:34:26
<transcript>: Use a Cond environment. Install missing packages using either Pip or Conda. One of them use.

01:34:26
<transcript>: i love this

01:34:27
grasp5533: If you use a lot of Infrastructure-as-code you don't really need the AWS ui much

01:34:34
<transcript>: I love this. Go through every file and change torch device CPUs Kuda to torse that device MPs and register buffer.

01:34:34
<transcript>: in d

01:34:39
<transcript>: In DDM D dim pie change to oh, my God, this is so okay.

01:34:48
<transcript>: Should we just abandon and do this in AWS, that's the question. Should we just spin up a Tesla.

01:34:48
<transcript>: a one

01:34:55
<transcript>: A 100 or whatever in the cloud and do this. What's the vote? Anyone have a vote.

01:34:55
<transcript>: should

01:35:05
<transcript>: Should I not do this on my machine? Should I just set up? I just don't want to be working with an EC Two instance. That sounds really awful. And that's why people use Jupiter notebooks and stuff.

01:35:07
stroopwafel26: Yeah do an Ubuntu box with an Nvidia GPU

01:35:13
<transcript>: Using tree others.

01:35:13
<transcript>: oh that

01:35:15
<transcript>: Oh, that's somebody's fork.

01:35:16
chillcrunch37: anything more than 6 steps is too complicated

01:35:24
<transcript>: And Immerse it.

01:35:28
<transcript>: So many Forks and branches to get this stuff away.

01:35:32
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the follow.

01:35:32
<transcript>: panel

01:35:34
<transcript>: Panel.

01:35:37
<transcript>: It's more than six steps. Is too complicated. I agree.

01:35:45
crimsonxxmana: Sounds like you need a non apple computer. LUL

01:35:47
<transcript>: It's all CPU based. If you use a lot of Infrastructure's code, you don't really need the AWS you much exactly who complain about the items you I.

01:35:47
nullchefo: https://towardsdatascience.com/installing-pytorch-on-apple-m1-chip-with-gpu-acceleration-3351dc44d67c

01:35:49
<transcript>: Did something complained about the UI.

01:35:54
<transcript>: Anybody? No. Okay. I thought you were responding to somebody.

01:36:03
<transcript>: Yeah. You don't use the AWS UI like the console. You just don't use it much. It's.

01:36:03
<transcript>: it's

01:36:06
<transcript>: It's there for a reason, but it's not.

01:36:06
<transcript>: to spend all your time

01:36:08
<transcript>: To spend all your time building stuff in.

01:36:22
<transcript>: Sound like I need a new I need a non Apple computer. It does sound like that. I'm gonna put, like, a render server in my closet. I've got a big rack with a bunch of equipment. I'm gonna put a render server in there with some really high powered GPU, and I'm gonna just do this stuff that way.

01:36:22
<transcript>: but

01:36:28
<transcript>: But that doesn't help me today. So I have to buy that it's gonna take time to get here and all that.

01:36:33
<transcript>: What's the what's? The verdict here.

01:36:33
<transcript>: i wish there was

01:36:37
<transcript>: I wish there was a way to like sort by number of thumbs ups.

01:36:40
<transcript>: Like somebody.

01:36:45
<transcript>: In this thread is gonna have the most like yes. What this guy said.

01:36:50
<transcript>: And I need to know which one that is.

01:36:56
stroopwafel26: hey mo

01:37:00
<transcript>: In one Max with 64 gigabyrs around. The time is 26. 27 Segs. For 50 steps it was 30 seconds for the extra observation was at or a while ago.

edmund311: You just invented StackOverflow

01:37:08
<transcript>: Let's check in on checking on this thing.

01:37:12
<transcript>: In cute processing 60 minutes.

01:37:12
<transcript>: in one

01:37:14
<transcript>: In 1 hour people.

01:37:14
<transcript>: we can

01:37:17
<transcript>: We can do some LeBron James.

01:37:20
<transcript>: Dream boost from this thing Astria.

01:37:26
<transcript>: Oh Mo alley raid.

01:37:29
<transcript>: Do I saw how that working. Yeah. Hey.

01:37:37
mo_ali141: :)

01:37:38
<transcript>: First time chat. Welcome to Chat. Edmund. You just invented stack overflow. I just invented it.

01:37:46
<transcript>: Yeah. Doing you bunt two box with an Nvidia GPU.

01:37:46
stroopwafel26: adamdo8DealWithIt

01:37:49
<transcript>: You have a problem with that is just gonna be the.

01:37:53
<transcript>: Feedback loop of working with EC two.

01:37:53
<transcript>: i guess it's

01:37:56
<transcript>: I guess it's not bad. I'll just be SSH into it.

01:38:03
<transcript>: But then when I want to, like, I want to put photos on it.

01:38:03
<transcript>: to train it

01:38:05
<transcript>: To train it. I'm gonna have to like.

01:38:05
<transcript>: scp

01:38:10
stroopwafel26: SSM into it :P

01:38:12
<transcript>: Scp them and stuff like that. That I just don't want to do, you know what I'm saying? I just really don't want to do that.

01:38:12
mo_ali141: Use SSM so you don't have to have a public IP

01:38:13
mo_ali141: :)

01:38:18
<transcript>: I feel like I could follow one of these articles. It's like how to run it on a Mac, but is it gonna end up being super slow.

01:38:21
<transcript>: How to install and run tablefusion.

01:38:26
stroopwafel26: what @mo_ali141 said

01:38:28
<transcript>: We did the mini forged thing Conda and then.

01:38:32
<transcript>: Clone the weights.

01:38:32
<transcript>: prepare the

01:38:41
<transcript>: Prepare the environment. Okay, so here's condos subdur OSX Arms 64 Konda Environment Crate Environment Mac so that's what that fork that they're using is.

01:38:41
<transcript>: kind of activate

01:38:45
<transcript>: Kind of activate LDM, and then preload models and fix the file.

01:38:48
delvoid: heyyoo

01:38:49
<transcript>: Sampling change the line ten.

01:38:52
<transcript>: Oh, man.

01:38:54
stroopwafel26: heyo

01:38:56
<transcript>: This really is the Wild West, isn't it.

01:38:58
yeltrah_: Hey

01:39:02
<transcript>: Okay.

01:39:04
mo_ali141: Hola

01:39:04
<transcript>: When was this written.

01:39:08
<transcript>: September 6. I don't know. What do we think.

01:39:16
<transcript>: It's been a month and a half so since this was written, how much has this changed? Like changing this line? Tin.

01:39:24
<transcript>: Change line ten from this to this. Do we think that still reliable? A month and a half later, I'm guessing not.

01:39:26
<transcript>: Del voids here.

01:39:26
<transcript>: doubled

01:39:28
<transcript>: Doubled.

01:39:28
<transcript>: more

01:39:29
crimsonxxmana: Probably out of date now. LUL

01:39:31
<transcript>: More rating oh, Sorry, wrong.

01:39:34
<transcript>: Raid? Welcome devoid.

01:39:34
<transcript>: raiders

01:39:37
<transcript>: Raiders. Let's see. Use SSM.

01:39:39
vim_cerf: That seem right for an ML/AI package, sadly.

01:39:41
<transcript>: So you don't have to have a public IP.

01:39:46
<transcript>: Are we saying AWS is the right route here.

01:39:54
mo_ali141: If you're using ec2.

01:39:56
stroopwafel26: @vim_cerf are you the inventor of the internet

01:39:58
<transcript>: Is this what we want, people? We want me to spin up a GPU instance in the cloud that's running proper condu stuff.

01:40:04
<transcript>: I'm not opposed.

01:40:08
<transcript>: It's. It would eliminate all this.

01:40:08
<transcript>: hackiness

01:40:12
<transcript>: Hackiness. We just be able to do the basic save, but yeah, let's do it. Okay, let's do it.

01:40:12
<transcript>: let's do

01:40:18
vim_cerf: @stroopwafel26 I appreciate you for getting the pun <3

01:40:22
<transcript>: Let's do it. I say, let's do it with the weird hair and all. I'm gonna open up the A Tobis console. I just said, we you don't use a Tobis console. And then I pull up the console.

01:40:22
<transcript>: let's see

01:40:27
stroopwafel26: <3

01:40:27
<transcript>: Let's see. Do I want to draw on a fuzzy my screen. Let's fuzzy it.

01:40:32
<transcript>: Log into my account.

01:40:42
<transcript>: I use a UBI key so I don't know that I'm getting hacked anytime soon. I feel like it'd be hard for you to hack my UBI key. I don't know. Seems unrealistic.

01:40:47
<transcript>: Okay, so we're gonna make an EC two instance.

01:40:48
<transcript>: Let's.

01:40:48
<transcript>: so

01:40:51
stroopwafel26: know your tcp/ip history

01:40:52
<transcript>: So I'm gonna unfuzzy actually.

01:40:54
<transcript>: Actually.

01:41:02
<transcript>: I'm gonna take quick break, and then when I get back, we're gonna spin up an EC Two Essence. There's going to be.

01:41:02
<transcript>: a g

01:41:12
<transcript>: A GPU on it. We're gonna run through stable diffusion install that way we're gonna SCP Images, I guess. Sounds awful, but first.

01:41:12
<transcript>: first

01:41:15
<transcript>: First. I'm gonna take quick break. I'll be right back.

01:42:52
<transcript>: I didn't take a break. I haven't left yet because I'm trying to figure out what's going on with my Edel Crown.

01:42:52
<transcript>: i

01:42:55
<transcript>: I don't want to leave until let's see.

01:43:01
<transcript>: I'm gonna leave until I get the moving camera thing working because it's super cool.

01:43:01
<transcript>: and i

01:43:03
<transcript>: And I don't know why it's not working.

01:43:06
<transcript>: Let's see Edochron Web app.

01:43:14
<transcript>: Don't mind me just a little peek behind the curtain. Here.

01:43:17
<transcript>: Believe it's still working.

01:43:20
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:43:21
<transcript>: Right.

01:43:31
<transcript>: Hang on. We're gonna get this thing working.

01:43:35
<transcript>: The Web app.

01:43:40
<transcript>: Configuration.

01:43:45
<transcript>: Port, three, two, two.

01:43:47
<transcript>: What.

01:43:54
<transcript>: Offline.

01:43:54
<transcript>: let's restart

01:43:56
<transcript>: Let's restart the SDK.

01:44:08
<transcript>: Some of you don't have no idea what I'm talking about right now. I thought I was gonna go on a break. I came back. And what am I doing? What is this? Well, I've got a moving camera rig and.

01:44:08
<transcript>: i for

01:44:17
<transcript>: I forgot to set it up before I start the stream. And it bothers me. I don't want to just, like, ignore that. It bothers me. I want to fix it. So we're fixing it.

01:44:22
<transcript>: Alright. I think a fixed it. And now I'm gonna go to break and you're gonna need to see what I'm talking about.

01:44:25
<transcript>: Because it's gonna be like a cool, moving camera thing.

01:44:32
<transcript>: And just clean up my desk so it doesn't look awful when this camera pans over here and looks at it.

01:44:39
<transcript>: Well, I said that.

01:44:43
<transcript>: Bundling.

01:44:45
grasp5533: aws hero flex

01:44:54
<transcript>: Is here. Flex. That's right. Thanks for the follow black octet.

01:44:58
<transcript>: Okay. Did it work.

01:45:05
<transcript>: Did it work, did it work.

01:45:20
<transcript>: I don't know I don't know if I.

01:45:20
<transcript>: might

01:45:21
<transcript>: Might be something wrong.

01:45:21
<transcript>: the sd

01:45:24
<transcript>: The SDK. It won't connect.

01:45:24
<transcript>: so i guess

01:45:28
<transcript>: So I guess I'm gonna take a break without a move in camera.

01:45:28
<transcript>: it pains me

01:45:29
<transcript>: It pains me.

01:45:32
<transcript>: I'm physically pained.

01:45:34
<transcript>: Wireless.

01:45:34
<transcript>: connect

01:45:35
<transcript>: Connect.

01:45:38
<transcript>: Now it's thinking about it.

01:45:46
<transcript>: So all stuff I should have done before I started this stream.

01:45:47
<transcript>: But it didn't.

01:45:52
<transcript>: So now you're just you're watching the side of my face while I try to make this work.

01:46:09
<transcript>: Let's re. I got it. I figured it out. Hang on.

01:46:13
cowfacedude99: most stressful time of your life LUL

01:47:00
<transcript>: Okay. I'm gonna break whatever most stressful time in my life. Yes. Cow, face.

01:47:00
<transcript>: i

01:47:03
<transcript>: I'm just whatever I'm gonna just I'm going to break.

01:47:03
<transcript>: it's

01:47:05
<transcript>: It's not gonna work.

01:47:08
<transcript>: But I'm over it. I think.

01:47:12
<transcript>: I just learned to be over with over things. Okay. Here we go.

01:54:40
<transcript>: My amazing wife made Mobity.

01:54:42
<transcript>: Bubble tea fans.

01:54:42
<transcript>: anybody

01:54:43
<transcript>: Anybody.

01:54:45
stroopwafel26: ohai

01:54:45
<transcript>: It is so good.

01:54:47
<transcript>: So good.

01:54:47
<transcript>: rat

01:54:51
<transcript>: Rat fill my water. Oh, no, I didn't. It's full.

01:54:56
<transcript>: All right? So.

01:55:00
<transcript>: What we done.

01:55:00
<transcript>: we're gonna

01:55:01
<transcript>: We're gonna set up.

01:55:01
<transcript>: oh hi

01:55:03
<transcript>: Oh Hi.

01:55:08
<transcript>: I think for the follow I Nymphodora and Black Octet we're going to.

01:55:08
<transcript>: we're gonna create

01:55:10
<transcript>: We're gonna create.

01:55:10
<transcript>: a

01:55:12
<transcript>: A cloud based.

01:55:12
<transcript>: stable diffusion

01:55:16
<transcript>: Stable diffusion training rig. We're gonna use AWS.

01:55:20
<transcript>: Ec two. I suppose this is a perfect opportunity.

01:55:20
<transcript>: for

01:55:23
<transcript>: For containerization. This is the kind of moment where.

01:55:23
<transcript>: i should

01:55:26
<transcript>: I should just, like, write it off.

01:55:27
<transcript>: And actually.

01:55:27
<transcript>: like

01:55:32
<transcript>: Like making it. I bet somebody's already done this right. We're gonna Google that first thing.

01:55:32
<transcript>: somebody's done this

01:55:33
<transcript>: Somebody's done this.

01:55:36
<transcript>: Somebody.

01:55:38
<transcript>: Has done this.

01:55:41
<transcript>: Stable diffusion.

01:55:45
<transcript>: Dream boot.

01:55:45
<transcript>: docker

01:55:46
<transcript>: Docker file.

01:55:46
<transcript>: let's just get

01:55:48
<transcript>: Let's just get.

01:55:48
<transcript>: a swing for a

01:55:50
<transcript>: A swing for a home run.

01:55:50
<transcript>: swing for the

01:55:52
<transcript>: Swing for the fences first.

01:55:57
<transcript>: Dream boos.

01:56:03
<transcript>: And then if we can't find Dream Booth, we'll just go with Stabilizing fusion, darker file.

01:56:13
<transcript>: This just needs to be needs to be a thing, right.

01:56:18
<transcript>: People Docker image.

01:56:18
<transcript>: hey

01:56:19
<transcript>: Hey.

01:56:19
<transcript>: hey hey

01:56:20
<transcript>: Hey, Hey.

01:56:23
<transcript>: Now we're talking.

01:56:43
neochromer: @adamdotdev what do you think of an Microservice architecture using Java services?

01:56:46
neochromer: is that something good or bad?

01:56:49
<transcript>: Is GPU to compute the VAE texting cutter and remove them from Kuda afterwards.

01:56:57
neochromer: started working on a weird proj at work..

01:57:05
<transcript>: Neil Kromer What do you think of an A. Microservice architecture using Java services? This is something good or bad. Starting working on a weird project at work. Thank you for the follow. Timid. First of all, second of all.

01:57:10
<transcript>: You know the Parks and Rec.

01:57:14
<transcript>: Is and at this point I'm afraid to ask.

01:57:14
<transcript>: what's his name

01:57:16
<transcript>: What's his name.

01:57:20
<transcript>: What is his name? What's that? Actor's name? Chris Pratt.

01:57:20
<transcript>: his character

01:57:21
<transcript>: His character.

01:57:21
<transcript>: i don't know what

01:57:28
<transcript>: I don't know what microservices are. And at this time at this point I'm afraid to ask. I say that kind of hat jokingly, but like.

01:57:28
<transcript>: honestly

01:57:29
neochromer: Chris Pratt

01:57:30
neochromer: ye haha

01:57:41
neochromer: so a few docker containers running Java

01:57:42
<transcript>: Honestly, I've worked by myself for so long and on very tiny teams. The idea of microservice has never had any appeal to me because I think the point in microservices I think is.

01:57:47
<transcript>: To start controversy. I think the point of them is like you have a huge organization.

01:57:47
<transcript>: and you want individual

01:57:54
<transcript>: And you want individual teams build a work on their thing and isolation and have clear boundaries between the things and all that stuff. I guess.

01:57:58
neochromer: and communicatin with each other

01:58:01
<transcript>: I don't. I don't know. I don't know. Of what are the success stories with Microservices? I just don't know.

01:58:01
<transcript>: but i

01:58:03
<transcript>: But I don't I don't do it.

01:58:03
<transcript>: and i

01:58:06
<transcript>: And I really kind of want nothing to do with it.

01:58:18
cowfacedude99: although java sounds bad... but if you manage them properly, I don't think it would be that bad

01:58:18
tiredbeaver: adam does the mega services

01:58:19
<transcript>: So a few Docker containers running Java. I mean, that sounds. Yeah, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I think microservices as a term. There's a lot of baggage. And I don't know. I don't know exactly what it means.

01:58:22
<transcript>: It probably means different things to every organization.

01:58:22
<transcript>: and

01:58:26
<transcript>: And I just generally try to avoid the word because I feel like if I ever use the word.

01:58:26
<transcript>: i'm probably

01:58:29
tiredbeaver: macro services

01:58:30
<transcript>: I'm probably going to confuse some people. Some people. Yes.

01:58:30
<transcript>: i'm following

01:58:36
tiredbeaver: labels are just labels

01:58:41
<transcript>: I'm following you. And some people be like, Wait a minute. I know what microservices means. And that sounds like a terrible idea. So I just don't use the word. I build a lot of, like, loosely coupled services.

01:58:41
tiredbeaver: gotta be specific

01:58:42
stroopwafel26: Microservices are going out of fashion again (luckily), a lot of companies I'm working with are slowly moving back to monolithic applications

01:58:45
<transcript>: And I do a lot of stuff, even as a sole Dev.

01:58:45
<transcript>: where

01:58:52
<transcript>: Where maybe it's called maybe that's microservices. I don't know. I just don't know what it means from, like a runtime standpoint.

01:58:58
neochromer: interesting

01:59:02
chillcrunch37: its like OOP, fence off this an minimize dependencies

01:59:02
<transcript>: I think it's more of an organizational concept, like we want to break up our project into disparate services that can be worked on in isolation. I think.

01:59:02
<transcript>: i don't know

01:59:05
<transcript>: I don't know. I just don't like the term.

01:59:05
neochromer: well our use case is really scalability

01:59:12
<transcript>: Mega Services now we're talking.

01:59:15
neochromer: we expect like a lot of users

01:59:16
<transcript>: I think.

01:59:16
<transcript>: yeah

01:59:18
neochromer: and transactions

01:59:20
<transcript>: Yeah, I think a bunch of containers running Java sounds fine.

01:59:23
grasp5533: Single purpose serverless functions all the way

01:59:37
neochromer: so why Microservices, just becuase we can spin up other services to scale..

01:59:40
<transcript>: Macro services. Labels are just labels. That's right. Microservices are going out of fashion again. A lot of companies I'm working with are slowly moving back to monolithic applications. I don't know if the term microservices was ever. In fact, honestly, I don't know at what point in the timeline it was ever in fashion. I feel like the moment it became.

01:59:40
<transcript>: part of

01:59:43
<transcript>: Part of like the conversation.

01:59:43
<transcript>: people

01:59:49
<transcript>: People started shooting it down. I feel like the moment people started saying, you should use microservices.

01:59:49
<transcript>: there were the

01:59:52
neochromer: anyay thanks for the convo :D

01:59:56
<transcript>: There were the means about microservices. I don't know when it was ever like, I don't know if it ever had its moment in the spotlight.

01:59:59
<transcript>: Maybe it did. Maybe I missed it.

02:00:03
stroopwafel26: Large-ish companies all wanted microservices in some capacity for a few years

02:00:04
<transcript>: It's like, oh, pee fince off this and minimize dependencies.

02:00:09
<transcript>: Thanks for the follows up Suno and lacool dude.

02:00:14
<transcript>: Seeing your name la cool. Dude. Reminds me. We do have a LeBron.

02:00:14
<transcript>: thing

02:00:16
stroopwafel26: coming from someone who does infrastructure for large orgs

02:00:25
<transcript>: Thing up here in the cloud training on Astria's services. So what we're gonna end to build is basically what they built. I think they probably have just like a farm of.

02:00:25
<transcript>: gpu and a

02:00:25
lekooldude: :)

02:00:31
<transcript>: Gpu and a virtual machines that they're doing the training on and then.

02:00:31
<transcript>: they put

02:00:38
<transcript>: They put a little web UI on top of it. I was very much going to build this if it didn't exist. Looks like it does. So I'm not gonna try and build it.

02:00:42
<transcript>: What was I doing? I was trying to figure out.

02:00:42
<transcript>: maybe

02:00:44
<transcript>: Maybe cheering. Yeah. Okay.

02:00:50
cowfacedude99: when managers get on the trend.. probably a good time to hop off the hype train LUL

02:00:52
<transcript>: Scalability we expect a lot of users and transactions, singlepurpose service functions all the way. Now we're talking great.

02:00:54
bbogdanov: Define `large` org

02:00:57
neochromer: @stroopwafel26 literally my job now

02:01:01
<transcript>: Yeah, no problem. New York. I'm not saying anything helpful.

02:01:04
<transcript>: Here's. The thing about tech.

02:01:04
<transcript>: it's very

02:01:05
stroopwafel26: @NeoChromer imo scaling a single application is much easier than scaling 100 tiny applications (microservices), you'll probably never get it right

02:01:05
neochromer: 38k devs

02:01:08
<transcript>: It's very hard to take any advice on the internet.

02:01:08
<transcript>: it's very hard to give

02:01:08
neochromer: I think we are a large corp

02:01:10
<transcript>: It's very hard to give advice on the internet because.

02:01:15
<transcript>: We all have very different views of the world, very different context that we live in.

02:01:24
<transcript>: What works for me as a solo Dev trying to build with as much leverage as a single Dev can get. Like I'm focused on managed services.

02:01:24
<transcript>: how can i

02:01:32
<transcript>: How can I use proven solutions to problems both them all together to create a really great stable app.

02:01:32
<transcript>: without needing

02:01:34
<transcript>: Without needing a team.

02:01:34
<transcript>: that's

02:01:39
bbogdanov: Yea 30k+ is a pretty large group

02:01:45
<transcript>: That's a very different view of the world than, like a big organization that has a bunch of engineers. And they have, like, teams. And they have totally different concerns. So it's very hard for me to give advice on the Internet, like on Twitter.

02:01:58
edmund311: That's good advice. I mean, if you could give advice on the internet.

02:02:05
<transcript>: Because ultimately, I'm speaking to just people who have my situation and that's very small slivers. And you can't really qualify at the beginning of every advice, I can lose everybody if you're like, I want to give some advice to people like me. So I have to lay out what it is that this advice applies to like, if you do this, this this and this and you work at a place like this.

02:02:05
<transcript>: this or this

02:02:06
<transcript>: This or this.

02:02:06
<transcript>: and

02:02:09
<transcript>: And you've been there for this many years.

02:02:09
<transcript>: like i

02:02:11
<transcript>: Like I can't lay all that out. And this.

02:02:16
<transcript>: Statement try and give you advice because you've checked out way before that right.

02:02:16
<transcript>: so it's really hard

02:02:20
<transcript>: So it's really hard, especially Twitter. It's a little easier on Twitch. I feel like.

02:02:27
<transcript>: Because there's, like, dialogue here. I can actually say words. Okay. I'm gonna try and catch up on chat.

02:02:29
caldotjs: hey adam how are you doing? :)

02:02:35
<transcript>: Largest companies, all one in microservices and capacity for a few years, coming from someone who does infrastructure. Okay, that makes sense.

02:02:35
<transcript>: i'm sure it has

02:02:38
<transcript>: I'm sure it has its moment in spotlight or it wouldn't have had all the.

02:02:38
<transcript>: ant

02:02:42
<transcript>: Anti microservice people welcome to Chat la, cool dude.

02:02:48
<transcript>: When managers get on that trend, if sounds like I'm chewing it's because I'm chewing bubbles.

02:02:48
<transcript>: and my

02:02:50
<transcript>: And my bubble tea.

02:02:55
<transcript>: I'm very recently a bubble teeth fanatic. I somehow didn't know they existed.

02:02:55
<transcript>: for thirty

02:03:00
<transcript>: For 36 years of my life. And in the last two months, my family and I discovered bubble tea.

02:03:00
<transcript>: so now we make

02:03:04
<transcript>: So now we make bubble tea. We go buy bubble tea. We're just bubble tea fans.

02:03:05
lekooldude: very wise advices

02:03:07
<transcript>: But I'm chewing on bubbles.

02:03:14
stroopwafel26: managers love their buzzwords so they also love microservices, now everyone wants a blockchain for no reason

02:03:16
cowfacedude99: I think BG's advice is one of the best here. Understand what your requirements are and build a TDD. and start off from there.

02:03:17
<transcript>: When managers get on the train path, probably a good time to hop off the Hype train. So here's my here's my thing and also be bogged Dan Off says to find large.org.

02:03:19
neochromer: I never had bubble tea

02:03:20
<transcript>: More than 20 people.

02:03:30
<transcript>: That's my other view of the world. Is that like I think the future belongs to tiny teams. Here's the thing. Every time you add more people.

02:03:36
<transcript>: As soon as you go from one person building something to two people building something.

02:03:36
<transcript>: you're losing

02:03:37
<transcript>: You're losing.

02:03:37
<transcript>: some

02:03:41
<transcript>: Some like you're adding some friction in terms of communication.

02:03:41
<transcript>: now

02:03:53
<transcript>: Now you're also gaining a lot more bandwidth and a lot more perspective. And like, there are definitely advantages to adding people and growing to a small team. That's very powerful.

02:03:53
<transcript>: but like

02:04:03
<transcript>: But like every single person adds to the game of telephone, it adds to, like, the overhead. You have to have conversations to keep in sync. You're working together, like.

02:04:03
<transcript>: one person

02:04:05
<transcript>: One person is the ultimate.

02:04:09
<transcript>: Like there is no overhead.

02:04:09
<transcript>: they can

02:04:12
<transcript>: They can work within their own brain.

02:04:12
<transcript>: and

02:04:18
tiredbeaver: @NeoChromer try it

02:04:21
<transcript>: And I think we're getting more and more tools. As Steve Job said, Bicycles for the Mind, like AI is gonna totally blow open what a single person can do.

02:04:21
<transcript>: they don't

02:04:30
<transcript>: They don't have to have artistic skills anymore. Like you can do things that used to were just limited numbers of people could do these.

02:04:30
<transcript>: varying

02:04:32
<transcript>: Varying concerns? Well.

02:04:32
<transcript>: i don't

02:04:39
lekooldude: most of the time i feel it so complicated to agree with myself

02:04:43
<transcript>: I don't that make sense. I think the future belongs to tiny teams because the more people you add, the harder it is now to organize and to run. Now, there are reasons to have huge organization like.

02:04:43
<transcript>: i think

02:04:51
<transcript>: I think the commoditized. Commoditize things like when I think of like Amazon and what they build and the logistical nightmare that is.

02:04:51
<transcript>: like

02:05:07
<transcript>: Like servicing millions of customers physically shipping products, like there are reasons huge organizations have to exist to do types of things that you just can't do with a small team. But I think in terms of, like software products and like the majority of work being done in the future.

02:05:07
<transcript>: in terms of

02:05:11
<transcript>: In terms of like internet deployment, web apps and things like that.

02:05:13
tiredbeaver: are we still talking about microservices

02:05:14
tiredbeaver: LUL

02:05:17
<transcript>: Small teams. I just think that's the future. So anytime I'm looking at an organization, that's a software organization.

02:05:17
<transcript>: and there are hundreds of people

02:05:22
<transcript>: And there are hundreds of people. I just think, like, that's not the future. I don't know. That's my lens. That's my view of the world.

02:05:22
<transcript>: so when i

02:05:24
caldotjs: I really resonate with this line of arguments.. imo speed & attention are most crucial. In a smaller team you can have really focused work and move FAST

02:05:25
tiredbeaver: oh wait

02:05:27
<transcript>: So when I say large.org, I mean more than like 1520 people.

02:05:27
tiredbeaver: nevermind

02:05:30
<transcript>: Think that's the sweet spot.

02:05:33
<transcript>: Okay. I'm ranting. Ranting a lot.

02:05:37
<transcript>: Scaling Single application must use your instaling 100 Tiny applications.

02:05:44
<transcript>: 380 devs. Oh my word, neocromer. You work as an organization with 380 developers.

02:05:54
<transcript>: I just that boggles my mind. I don't understand what 38,000 developers could be working on at the same time. Well, it's probably not the same thing, right.

02:05:54
<transcript>: that's

02:05:56
<transcript>: That's a pretty large group.

02:05:59
<transcript>: It is a pretty pretty large group.

02:05:59
stroopwafel26: 38.000 developers, what do all these people do?

02:06:01
<transcript>: Calvin.

02:06:01
<transcript>: cow that i'm

02:06:07
<transcript>: Cow that I'm doing well, I'm raining about I don't even know what I'm raining about I'm raining about stuff.

02:06:09
<transcript>: Just I'm all over the place.

02:06:10
edmund311: 38k developers? You'd just write documentation all day.

02:06:14
weavdale: Love your terminal!

02:06:15
<transcript>: Managers love their buzzwords. They also love micro services. Now everyone wants a blockchain for no reason.

02:06:21
grasp5533: They just managed git conflicts

02:06:22
<transcript>: Bg's advice is one of the best here. Understand what your requirements are and build a TDT and start off from there.

02:06:22
<transcript>: build

02:06:25
<transcript>: Build a TDD, what's a TDD.

02:06:25
<transcript>: you

02:06:26
stroopwafel26: lol

02:06:28
neochromer: @adamdotdev ye I mean globally

02:06:29
caldotjs: have you played around with nix yet adam? I think you might like it. just finished my first working setup and its so awesome.

02:06:30
<transcript>: You've never had bubble teeth, neocromer, I'm glad I could expose you to a new thing that you're gonna love.

02:06:35
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow Ed Hill Adil is Ed.

02:06:36
<transcript>: edil

02:06:36
<transcript>: edil hasan

02:06:38
caldotjs: no shit @stroopwafel26 is back :D

02:06:39
<transcript>: Edil Hasan. Did I say it right.

02:06:40
lekooldude: no they just spend all their time in meetings

02:06:43
<transcript>: So complicated agree with myself.

02:06:43
cowfacedude99: Technical Design Document. @adamdotdev

02:06:49
neochromer: Its not the same thing its mostly Embeded engineers and I'm "pioneering" in the IOT/Cloud dev team which is new

02:06:55
bbogdanov: @cowfacedude99 :D :D

02:06:56
neochromer: the company is super behind everything modern web tech

02:06:57
<transcript>: I guess we're talking about microservices. Tyra Beaver. I'm still a little behind in chat, but I think I think we are really resonate with this line of arguments. Speed and attention are most crucial and a smaller team you can lead. You can have really focused work and move fast. That's right.

02:07:01
piktonus97x: It's never too late to enjoy Bubble Tea :)

02:07:04
<transcript>: Somebody. I like this. Somebody said. Small teams move fast. Large teams move, go far.

02:07:14
<transcript>: I bought that small teams go fast. Big teams go far. So I do think there's a place more for these huge organizations.

02:07:14
<transcript>: i just don't

02:07:22
<transcript>: I just don't think that's I think that's the edge case. I think that's the things that are, like, less.

02:07:33
neochromer: I have like ~40 ppl in my dev team but we are all in different teams so not that extreme haha

02:07:34
tiredbeaver: it also could mean that the company is hiring TOO much

02:07:37
chillcrunch37: @edmund311 40% writing documentation. another 40% writing tests, the rest is actually thinking about coding

02:07:42
neochromer: different projects*

02:07:42
<transcript>: Someone Simon Wordly, who I respect so much after the DHH post. If you didn't see the DHH posts, David, whatever happened? The Rails guy the base camp guy who uses Base Camp, by the way, does anyone use Base camp? Like I see that they have revenue and like hundreds of thousands of users, I don't know a single person using Base Camp. Do I just not hang.

02:07:42
<transcript>: out in the circle

02:07:43
tiredbeaver: i don't

02:07:46
tiredbeaver: LUL

02:07:46
stroopwafel26: @caldotjs caldot is back!

02:07:53
caldotjs: haha same! never met a basecamp user

02:07:53
<transcript>: Out in the circles. I just kind of like, can't stand everything he says on the Internet. But he had this whole, like, post about there leaving the cloud because they're really dumb. And that's just really dumb. So I'm sorry. It's really dumb.

02:07:53
<transcript>: his

02:08:03
<transcript>: His view of the cloud is just very warped. But Simon Woodley came out and said, Basically, you have to think in terms of like the majority cases and edge cases.

02:08:03
<transcript>: i'm not

02:08:09
<transcript>: I'm not saying serverless is a like.

02:08:09
<transcript>: solv

02:08:24
stroopwafel26: my wife can do some stuff herself again after surgery so i'm back!

02:08:29
<transcript>: Solvall not a catchall for every single thing that will happen in the future. I think it's the majority thing that should be happening. Like if you're building digital products, you should probably be using serverless unless you fit in one of these edge cases. If you're building base camp for a few hundred thousand users, that's not one of those edge cases. You should not be running your own onpremise infrastructure. It's just the dumbest thing in the world. I'm gonna get really.

02:08:29
<transcript>: mad

02:08:37
<transcript>: Mad and fired up. I have no reason to be mad about it. It's just more misinformation. There's just so much misinformation out there on the internet. It drives me nuts.

02:08:37
<transcript>: it doesn't affect

02:08:42
<transcript>: It doesn't affect me personally. I can sift through it and I can see it and just say.

02:08:42
<transcript>: and ignore it

02:08:55
caldotjs: @caldotjs Stroop I might have something to get you hooked (as an infrastructure guy) :D have you looked at nix

02:08:58
<transcript>: And ignore it. But it affects lots of new people in the field or people who do not have the context. And that really bothers me. It just really bothers me now. I know I can't criticize DHH publicly because it's like, what have I done? He's they've made rails. Like people love rails.

02:08:58
<transcript>: but

02:09:01
<transcript>: But also like.

02:09:01
<transcript>: that

02:09:09
<transcript>: That post was so wrong on so many Love. So go read Simon Wardley. Just look up Simon Wordly on Twitter.

02:09:09
<transcript>: he

02:09:10
caldotjs: @stroopwafel26 wonderful! hope she is doing better

02:09:14
<transcript>: He makes all the right arguments. He's very intelligent and he's the reason, I believe.

02:09:14
<transcript>: serverless is

02:09:17
<transcript>: Serverless is the future for most stuff.

02:09:24
<transcript>: Okay. I'm all over the place. I'm ranting. Why am I doing this? We need to stable diffusion. That's what we're doing right now.

02:09:31
<transcript>: 300 developers, what are all these people do.

02:09:31
<transcript>: you just

02:09:31
stroopwafel26: nix is cool yeah, i want nix homemanager on my machine at some point but i didn't yet take the time

02:09:33
<transcript>: You just write out documentation all day.

02:09:37
<transcript>: Complex.

02:09:37
<transcript>: globally

02:09:38
lekooldude: Simon Wardley ?

02:09:39
<transcript>: Globally. Yeah, it's a big organization.

02:09:47
<transcript>: I have not played with Nick's. No. Finish my first working setup. Can you share, like your setup for me or something.

02:09:55
<transcript>: It's been all the time in meetings, technical design documents. See, I'm glad I didn't know what that was. Cow face. I see TDD and I'm like test driven development.

02:09:55
<transcript>: but

02:10:01
<transcript>: But technical design document. I don't know what those are because I've never worked in order, organization.

02:10:01
<transcript>: large enough

02:10:04
<transcript>: Large enough to have technical design documents.

02:10:10
caldotjs: @adamdotdev https://github.com/caldotdev/.nixpkgs

02:10:21
<transcript>: Stop the same thing I do respect, like when I hear about Amazon and how they do so much of their discussion and like arguments for and against things in writing. I respect that because it does take a lot more thought to articulate your argument.

02:10:21
<transcript>: in a document

02:10:28
<transcript>: In a document and then present that to others to be scrutinized. I think that's a great way to work. I think Amazon has proven they can build some amazing.

02:10:28
caldotjs: need to add neovim but spent to much time on it today already

02:10:31
stroopwafel26: @caldotjs i'll put nixos on my intel nuc at some point as well

02:10:32
piktonus97x: I work for a huge organization, directly with the research/development and provisioning team of their cloud services. You can imagine which company lol. Large and lots of teams, but also those numbers vary depending of their kind of research/development they do.

02:10:48
<transcript>: Amazing things. And so I'm not discounting larger organizations. I think they should exist. I just think like the majority of in the majority of startups are small teams. Right? So I think like the world in the future belongs to small teams with high leverage. Each individual doing a whole lot compared to what we could do 20 years ago. Right? 20 years ago, when all you had.

02:10:48
<transcript>: was rail

02:10:51
<transcript>: Was rails or 15 years ago. Whatever.

02:11:05
<transcript>: I mean, yeah, an individual developer can do a lot, but then you have to deploy it, and you have to worry about Ops and all these things that the future belongs to, not worrying about all those things and doing the least amount of non differentiated things as possible.

02:11:14
<transcript>: It's not the same thing. It's mostly embedded engineers. I'm pioneering in the IoT Cloud Dev team which is new company super behind everything modern web tech.

02:11:14
<transcript>: welcome to chat

02:11:19
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Picktonus. Never too late to enjoy bubble tea. That's right. It's so good.

02:11:19
<transcript>: i have like forty

02:11:24
<transcript>: I have like 40 people in my Dev team, but we are all on different teams, so not that extreme.

02:11:27
<transcript>: It also means companies hiring too much.

02:11:32
<transcript>: 40% writing Documentation Another 4% writing test is actually thinking about coding.

02:11:37
<transcript>: Never made a bank base campuser me neither.

02:11:43
<transcript>: Hey, Stroop. Your wife can do some stuff after surgery. That's good.

02:11:43
<transcript>: that's good

02:11:45
<transcript>: That's good.

02:11:45
<transcript>: i'm glad to hear

02:11:48
<transcript>: I'm glad to hear that. Shoot. I might have something to get you hooked.

02:11:55
<transcript>: Next is cool. We're talking about Nick. Simon Wordly. Yes. Take a look at Simon wordly.

02:11:57
<transcript>: Lakool? Dude.

02:12:05
<transcript>: I work for a huge organization directly with the research, development and provisioning team.

02:12:12
<transcript>: Also, the numbers vary depending on the kind of research about me to do.

02:12:15
<transcript>: Okay.

02:12:15
<transcript>: that's

02:12:24
stroopwafel26: @caldotjs starred your repo so i can blatantly copy it

02:12:25
<transcript>: That's enough for anything. Let's let's spin up. Well, Geez, good timing, Cuppace. That was actually great timing. Right before I kind of got into something.

02:12:28
<transcript>: That's way better than.

02:12:28
<transcript>: the alternative

02:12:30
<transcript>: The alternative, which is like I'm writing in those.

02:12:34
<transcript>: Transition in the rant.

02:12:37
<transcript>: Let's get some Rick rolling.

02:12:39
<transcript>: It's been a while.

02:12:39
neochromer: Writin good documentation is an essentiall skill

02:12:43
<transcript>: It's been a really long time since anyone has a Rick rolled me.

02:12:51
caldotjs: @caldotjs I can absolutely recommend that. tbh it was a pain in the ass to get it going since all the repos you find are overengineered as hell

02:12:56
<transcript>: They're still Chromebook on Mac. I can't route the audio to my stream. I'm sorry.

02:12:59
<transcript>: So you all don't get to listen to.

02:13:05
<transcript>: Rick athlete.

02:13:10
<transcript>: You've heard the song, right? Do I need to sing it for you.

02:13:14
cowfacedude99: @caldotjs same

02:13:18
<transcript>: Okay. Just be done with that.

02:13:24
cowfacedude99: been saving the points LUL

02:13:26
<transcript>: Where was I was on this one. Oh, yeah, Chrome. I got a reopen. Chrome.

02:13:29
yeltrah_: @caldotjs same

02:13:33
<transcript>: Okay.

02:13:35
stroopwafel26: i'm saving up for animadam

02:13:38
<transcript>: So many browsers. Okay.

02:13:41
<transcript>: So somebody has to have.

02:13:41
yeltrah_: @cowfacedude99 saving for animadam

02:13:43
<transcript>: Just a Docker file. Right.

02:13:48
<transcript>: We're gonna write one. It's there's not one. We're writing it.

02:13:55
<transcript>: A Docker file for this thing to run specifically on Amazon Linux.

02:14:00
<transcript>: That best. I think Amazon Linux would be the most efficient. We want to run this thing.

02:14:03
<transcript>: On an Amazon.

02:14:03
<transcript>: instance

02:14:09
<transcript>: Instance with do I have my I don't know if my account I gotta make sure I've got GPU instances enabled.

02:14:16
<transcript>: Because I'm asked for the support ticket in I don't know in this account if I do you know, saying.

02:14:19
<transcript>: We want instant type.

02:14:19
<transcript>: it's the g

02:14:23
cowfacedude99: I thought that you were not a fan of docker.

02:14:25
<transcript>: It's the GPU. G four. Is there D five. Now I might be way behind. Is there G six.

02:14:28
<transcript>: Now G Five is late. Okay.

02:14:35
cowfacedude99: @cowfacedude99 Big brain move....

02:14:38
<transcript>: G, Five, Four, XL, 24 XL. We're gonna do 64 gigs, maybe 192 gigs.

02:14:38
<transcript>: five

02:14:41
<transcript>: $5 an hour.

02:14:44
<transcript>: Or do we want.

02:14:46
<transcript>: 64 gigs.

02:14:51
<transcript>: I don't know that should be enough, right? 64 gigs should be fine.

02:14:51
<transcript>: one hundred and twenty eight

02:14:54
<transcript>: 128 Even sounds better than.

02:14:54
<transcript>: one hundred and ninety

02:14:55
<transcript>: 192.

02:15:04
<transcript>: We'll start with four XL. Okay, let me just see if I can even. I don't even know if I can spin one of these up. I might not have the.

02:15:11
<transcript>: Launch instance let's just try it's gonna tell me oh, keep her.

02:15:11
<transcript>: we

02:15:13
<transcript>: We're gonna create a new key.

02:15:18
<transcript>: Dream booth.

02:15:23
<transcript>: Okay.

02:15:31
<transcript>: Kind of launch one. It's gonna tell me if I can launch. No. Yeah. Vcpu capacity.

02:15:31
<transcript>: karvy

02:15:35
<transcript>: Karvy Cube of zero. So I need to reach out.

02:15:37
<transcript>: Here.

02:15:44
<transcript>: So Amazon just so you know, AWS doesn't allow you to spin up GPU enabled instances.

02:15:44
<transcript>: by default

02:15:49
<transcript>: By default, you have to actually submit a quota increase.

02:15:49
<transcript>: so

02:15:53
<transcript>: So, Service quoted Dashboard We want additional limits.

02:15:57
<transcript>: To the region.

02:15:59
cowfacedude99: it's the same with gcp I think

02:16:00
<transcript>: I guess we'll do this in Ohio.

02:16:03
<transcript>: All G instances.

02:16:06
<transcript>: And I want ten of them.

02:16:16
<transcript>: Trying to train.

02:16:19
<transcript>: Table Diffusion models.

02:16:22
<transcript>: On easy to.

02:16:22
<transcript>: okay

02:16:23
lotuspixiee: yeah, gcp does the same

02:16:23
<transcript>: Okay.

02:16:25
fanieldanara: Woo, Ohio gang B)

02:16:27
<transcript>: Did they.

02:16:34
<transcript>: Madam, that's funny.

02:16:39
<transcript>: Let's see. I can absolutely recommend that.

02:16:50
<transcript>: You were not a fan of Docker. I'm not cow face. I'm definitely not a fan of Dockers. I'm not a fan. Here's. What I'm not a fan of.

02:16:50
<transcript>: ohio

02:16:57
<transcript>: Ohio Gang. Yeah, you don't. You don't mess around on us. East One. Right? Am I right? Am I right? You're Amorite. Right.

02:17:02
<transcript>: What's that saying? Oh, here's the thing about Docker.

02:17:02
<transcript>: i'm not

02:17:08
<transcript>: I'm not a fan of Docker when you're building like a Crud web app. I think so many people use containers.

02:17:12
<transcript>: In context where it makes zero sense.

02:17:12
<transcript>: if you're running

02:17:15
<transcript>: If you're running like a NodeJS backend.

02:17:15
<transcript>: and you think

02:17:19
<transcript>: And you think you need to have like a Docker file in your repo for that.

02:17:19
<transcript>: and most people

02:17:24
<transcript>: And most people do it for the local Dev, which come on.

02:17:24
<transcript>: how different

02:17:33
<transcript>: How different is it to say Docker compose up, then it is to say yarn Dev or Pnpm rundev like, Come on.

02:17:33
<transcript>: do we really need

02:17:35
<transcript>: Do we really need containers.

02:17:35
<transcript>: for like

02:17:45
<transcript>: For like running XJS app or run whatever an Express API. I think containerizations use way too much now there are instances where I use containers.

02:18:05
<transcript>: When I'm doing stuff with media. So I've in my weird career, I've done some stuff with like, well, I'm done. So I've done like, species of stuff at STM. That's like, you're using weird Libs, right? Any machine learning based stuff where you've got weird, like your system needs. Well, this stuff we're doing right now, right? The stablefusion stuff. You.

02:18:05
<transcript>: need to have

02:18:08
<transcript>: Need to have like Kuda toolkits and you need to have.

02:18:08
<transcript>: pietorch

02:18:11
<transcript>: Pietorch and all these things configured on your main.

02:18:15
<transcript>: Has a look at very specific way to run the thing right.

02:18:15
<transcript>: i did a thing

02:18:17
<transcript>: I did a thing with video.

02:18:22
<transcript>: Almost died on a bubble above a tea bubble.

02:18:29
<transcript>: Did a thing like Autocropping with Media Pipe from Google. So they have this model called Media pipe.

02:18:29
<transcript>: it's like a collection

02:18:35
<transcript>: It's like a collection of models anyway, it's like a NML pipeline for working with media.

02:18:36
sergioquijano: Yeah, docker for machine learning is a must because python packaging systems don't work at all

02:18:48
<transcript>: And they have a thing that's like an autocropper. So you can take a video file. Let's say you have a 16 by nine video file horizontal, like landscape. Right. And you want to just cut out a square where there's like.

02:18:51
<transcript>: Interest in the frame so like people's faces.

02:18:51
<transcript>: whatever

02:18:56
<transcript>: Whatever there's like a model in media pipe called Autocropper that does that.

02:18:56
<transcript>: so you can

02:19:16
<transcript>: So you can feed it a video. And you can say, I want to crop a square of this video, but the best square, right? I don't want to cut out just the middle because it might be like that there's people walking in the frame on the left side. Anyway, it does that throughout the whole video. So it follows frame by frame. And it's sort of like creates a smooth crop across the video to just to just have the most interesting.

02:19:16
<transcript>: square

02:19:25
cowfacedude99: @caldotjs that's pretty small install.

02:19:31
<transcript>: Square in that video or any other aspect ratio. You want that thing. Media Pipe has very specific requirements that you have to have at the OS level. You have to have all these packages and Libs installed in the right way. That's what containerizations for.

02:19:35
<transcript>: Okay containerization is not for.

02:19:35
<transcript>: i'm building

02:19:39
<transcript>: I'm building a CRM for carpeters.

02:19:40
<transcript>: And.

02:19:43
<transcript>: I'm going to use.

02:19:43
<transcript>: whatever

02:19:44
<transcript>: Whatever normal.

02:19:48
<transcript>: Vanilla Web frameworks.

02:19:48
<transcript>: don't use

02:19:53
<transcript>: Don't use containerization for that. Please. This is a YouTube video. I'm gonna make a YouTube video about it.

02:19:59
<transcript>: Okay.

02:20:03
<transcript>: So we've requested an increase.

02:20:03
<transcript>: in our ec two

02:20:06
<transcript>: In our EC two limits. That's going to take time.

02:20:08
<transcript>: That's a bummer.

02:20:13
<transcript>: We got two things that are taking time. We can go ahead and keep. We can keep moving, though.

02:20:13
<transcript>: seventeen

02:20:16
<transcript>: 17 minutes on this one. I'm curious. What that's gonna look like.

02:20:20
<transcript>: We did the full 6000 steps.

02:20:22
<transcript>: If you'll recall.

02:20:22
<transcript>: this was like

02:20:26
<transcript>: This was like we did the biggest.

02:20:29
<transcript>: And biggest number of training.

02:20:35
<transcript>: Okay. So we're trying to increase and get access to GP two GPU instances.

02:20:35
<transcript>: let

02:20:37
<transcript>: Let's.

02:20:37
<transcript>: let's

02:20:42
<transcript>: Let's see, let's. We're still trying to find I still feel like there's a Docker file out there somewhere.

02:20:42
<transcript>: stable fusion

02:20:44
<transcript>: Stable fusion.

02:20:46
caldotjs: @caldotjs I don't need much :D will add more as I go along.

02:20:48
<transcript>: Run. Here we go. Stabilizers and Docker.

02:21:00
<transcript>: So we specifically want one based on Amazon Linux. Okay. So the best case scenario here would be running Amazon Linux on Graviton instances.

02:21:00
<transcript>: okay

02:21:01
<transcript>: Okay.

02:21:08
<transcript>: That'd be the most efficient like combo of base image plus.

02:21:17
<transcript>: Cpu architecture, but I guess the GPU is the more important thing. So we want GPU enabled, like a G Five for XL.

02:21:23
<transcript>: We need to Docker file with all of the stable diffusion setup and it will just write one if we can if we can't find one.

02:21:23
<transcript>: let's see

02:21:24
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:21:24
<transcript>: docker

02:21:29
<transcript>: Docker Base stable. Here's. An app with batteries included. It's kind of what I'm looking for.

02:21:34
<transcript>: Tour to run on your computer base on the original Subdivision project.

02:21:40
<transcript>: Hassle of download Python libraries. Some model always loads back in for speedy image creation once over on.

02:21:45
<transcript>: So this is a good.

02:21:45
<transcript>: maybe good

02:21:48
<transcript>: Maybe good start let's look at their Docker file.

02:21:53
<transcript>: I'm assuming there's a Docker file in here. Docker, compose.

02:21:56
<transcript>: Backend.

02:21:56
<transcript>: here we go

02:21:59
<transcript>: Here we go. Here's. Their server Docker file.

02:22:06
<transcript>: So they're going based on Nvidia CUDA. So let's do this. Aws.

02:22:08
<transcript>: G, five.

02:22:10
<transcript>: Tutor.

02:22:15
<transcript>: File base image. I don't know. We're trying lots of stuff here.

02:22:21
<transcript>: I'm looking for Base images.

02:22:31
<transcript>: That already have all of the kudos stuff so AWS.

02:22:31
<transcript>: kud

02:22:32
<transcript>: Kuda.

02:22:35
<transcript>: Sacrifile or.

02:22:35
<transcript>: base imag

02:22:37
<transcript>: Base image.

02:22:44
<transcript>: Oh, deep learning. Here we go. Container images? This is what I'm looking for.

02:22:47
<transcript>: They already have Pi torch.

02:22:54
<transcript>: What are the available Deep Learning Container images? Here we are. We did it, folks.

02:22:54
<transcript>: we did something

02:22:55
<transcript>: We did something.

02:23:05
<transcript>: So there should be like multiple kinds of so these should have like the all the coated drivers and all that condo for it. Let's see.

02:23:09
<transcript>: If it seemed users.

02:23:19
<transcript>: What this gives us these base images will give us like.

02:23:19
<transcript>: all

02:23:25
<transcript>: All the hardware and software bolted together to use the GPU in EC two.

02:23:29
<transcript>: And here's where we're gonna see.

02:23:29
<transcript>: gravit

02:23:31
<transcript>: Graviton containers.

02:23:41
<transcript>: So they have TensorFlow PyTorch.

02:23:41
<transcript>: and m

02:23:43
<transcript>: And MX. Net.

02:23:46
<transcript>: I think we want Pi torch. Right.

02:23:54
<transcript>: I believe everything is based on PyTorch. With stable diffusion.

02:23:57
<transcript>: Sage maker.

02:23:57
<transcript>: now

02:24:00
<transcript>: Now Nvidia Triton.

02:24:00
<transcript>: kuda

02:24:01
<transcript>: Kuda.

02:24:04
<transcript>: Kuda is an Nvidia thing, right.

02:24:10
<transcript>: Auto glue on hugging face Hey.

02:24:16
<transcript>: Hugging face. Transformers. We've seen something about hugging face, right.

02:24:20
<transcript>: Last second.

02:24:29
<transcript>: So I think the odds of me choosing the right thing here.

02:24:29
<transcript>: pre low

02:24:32
<transcript>: Pre low like we need more information.

02:24:37
<transcript>: Let's say.

02:24:37
cowfacedude99: @caldotjs mine is getting complicated. mainly because I am using nixos to manage my os.

02:24:42
<transcript>: Able Diffusion EC. Two.

02:24:44
<transcript>: Or.

02:24:47
<transcript>: Amazon.

02:24:47
<transcript>: linux

02:24:49
<transcript>: Linux Base image.

02:24:57
<transcript>: Oh, look at this. Somebody's on a video on running it on. Aws.

02:25:01
<transcript>: Cloning. So there's.

02:25:01
<transcript>: just

02:25:02
<transcript>: Just.

02:25:10
cowfacedude99: although I am trying out flake dev environments and those have been pretty nice. especially for TS.

02:25:16
<transcript>: They're just like doing. They're just like setting up the easy to instance. I want to like, I want to ride a Docker file.

02:25:16
<transcript>: i'm pretty

02:25:18
<transcript>: I'm pretty convinced that's what I want to do.

02:25:25
<transcript>: Here we go. There's a good question on Reddit.

02:25:25
<transcript>: anyone got

02:25:29
<transcript>: Anyone got stable fusion working on AWS GPU enabled VM.

02:25:31
<transcript>: G Five X to large.

02:25:37
<transcript>: Some point initialization is complain about not seeing CUDA compatible GPU.

02:25:58
<transcript>: You have to use one of a devices deep learning machine. Yeah, we just literally were just on that page. Right. Deep Learning Machine images for OS. These have the Kuda toolkit, appropriate drivers and all the preinstalled deep learning images coming in Amazon, Linux and Ubuntu flavors. I was able to get stabbed user web UI running in Docker with no problems. Output is about 300 seconds per eight images.

02:25:58
<transcript>: at one hundred and

02:25:59
<transcript>: At 130 steps.

02:26:07
<transcript>: What's your recommendation on best instance type got running on G Three, Eight, XL.

02:26:07
<transcript>: i'm only getting one

02:26:10
<transcript>: I'm only getting one step a second in your recommendations are better.

02:26:10
<transcript>: i'm gonna

02:26:13
<transcript>: I'm gonna build some two iterations for a second.

02:26:20
<transcript>: Type of art, prompt, complexity, and other factors. Influences. I've seen nearly six iterations per second on the same VM.

02:26:25
<transcript>: Google Collab wants something a little faster we're gonna disconnect.

02:26:32
<transcript>: Okay, so here we go. Secret sauces that you don't want to just spin it up with a standard Ubuntu dividend images. Yeah, we know that.

02:26:32
<transcript>: getting started

02:26:34
<transcript>: Getting started Easy if you have a new discount.

02:26:38
<transcript>: If I'm talking really fast, I'm just kind of skimming.

02:26:43
<transcript>: You all out your time on Nick.

02:26:51
<transcript>: Here we go.

02:26:51
<transcript>: sibling

02:26:54
<transcript>: Sibling Diffusion Web UI Docker.

02:26:58
<transcript>: What would be.

02:26:58
<transcript>: let's talk about this

02:27:00
<transcript>: Let's talk about this. What would be the ideal.

02:27:00
<transcript>: like

02:27:04
<transcript>: Like, ergonomics of this thing. Let's say I create like a Fargate service.

02:27:07
<transcript>: That can spin up.

02:27:09
<transcript>: A stable diffusion.

02:27:14
<transcript>: Prepared image so an image that's already got.

02:27:16
<transcript>: Stable diffusion set up.

02:27:16
<transcript>: all that wired

02:27:19
<transcript>: All that wired up with the GPU, and all that.

02:27:25
<transcript>: The in and out of this is I need to be able to train a new model by giving it a collection of.

02:27:29
<transcript>: A training Images 20 Images for Dream booth.

02:27:31
<transcript>: And.

02:27:34
<transcript>: The app.

02:27:34
<transcript>: is

02:27:40
<transcript>: Is I want to be able to patch, so I need a little web service where I can pass prompts.

02:27:43
<transcript>: And get the images back right.

02:27:43
<transcript>: i'm just

02:27:49
<transcript>: I'm just making this for me. I'm not trying to make, like, a service. I'm just trying to make it where I have a little more control.

02:27:58
<transcript>: So we have an s three bucket, and maybe like.

02:28:11
<transcript>: Do I want to make, like a little API where I pass in the images to the API, or maybe I pass in pads doing a three bucket or something. Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

02:28:14
<transcript>: You pass in training images as paths.

02:28:14
<transcript>: in

02:28:18
<transcript>: In some downloadable like an s three bucket or something.

02:28:22
<transcript>: And then I can just create upload to that s three bucket.

02:28:27
<transcript>: And then the service is like Type A prompt.

02:28:47
<transcript>: Based on one of the pretrained models. So we'll have like multiple models. We'll have some state there and keep track of I'm building this. We're building it just wondering, what do you think about this for whole website and running simplication. We're gonna do this from a user. So how much expensive would it be? You could run a publiclyfacing service with our cabinet. A single G five X large instance. It's about 850 a month.

02:28:47
<transcript>: giving multiple

02:28:54
<transcript>: Giving multiple machines or you need a queuing system. If you really wanted to host something public facing, it would also certainly be cheaper to buy. Build a PC.

02:29:02
<transcript>: Easiest way to test how many generations you get on a Tobs is simply to fire up a unit and run the test.

02:29:13
<transcript>: I'm really not gonna miss database is the way to go for this scratch out. I'm convinced it'd be this is not the way to go for this unless you current unless you commit to reserving a VM or multiple VMs for more than a year.

02:29:19
<transcript>: Yeah. This would be expensive.

02:29:23
<transcript>: Okay.

02:29:29
<transcript>: But it's better than trying to do this on my Mac, right.

02:29:34
<transcript>: Oh, it's done. We can create LeBron images. Maybe.

02:29:41
<transcript>: We can download the checkpoint.

02:29:46
<transcript>: So we want to what do we want? Props to look like.

02:29:46
<transcript>: i guess

02:29:48
<transcript>: I guess also the question is.

02:29:51
<transcript>: How do we reference.

02:29:54
<transcript>: The person.

02:29:54
<transcript>: anybody

02:29:55
<transcript>: Anybody know.

02:29:55
<transcript>: like

02:29:57
<transcript>: Like.

02:29:59
<transcript>: How do I say.

02:30:06
<transcript>: So SKS Man is what it is? Sks? What's that stand for SKS man.

02:30:11
<transcript>: With a Crown.

02:30:11
<transcript>: sitting

02:30:14
<transcript>: Sitting on a throne? I don't know.

02:30:16
<transcript>: Like, what can it do.

02:30:22
<transcript>: Also, what is it this doing anything right now.

02:30:28
<transcript>: Examples.

02:30:31
<transcript>: This is why there's a whole thing.

02:30:37
<transcript>: That's why there's like a whole field of product engineering or whatever.

02:30:45
<transcript>: I need to know.

02:30:49
<transcript>: How.

02:30:49
<transcript>: to

02:30:50
<transcript>: To.

02:30:56
<transcript>: Try pictures.

02:30:59
<transcript>: Preferably one to one Oops.

02:31:08
<transcript>: Always include SKS class name oh, that's man Yeah.

02:31:15
<transcript>: Okay.

02:31:18
<transcript>: So.

02:31:18
<transcript>: why

02:31:23
<transcript>: Why? Why is it not generating anything? Do we know.

02:31:23
<transcript>: oh

02:31:25
<transcript>: Oh, processing. What is this.

02:31:28
<transcript>: What is this.

02:31:31
<transcript>: Is this for steel? Lebron.

02:31:31
<transcript>: no

02:31:33
<transcript>: No, is it.

02:31:35
<transcript>: What.

02:31:37
<transcript>: These are all pros.

02:31:42
<transcript>: Oh, maybe it's doing them for me.

02:31:49
<transcript>: Action figure. Oh, it's doing them for me. Cool. Okay, that doesn't look like a Bron, but.

02:31:52
<transcript>: Oxygen man.

02:31:54
<transcript>: It's doing stuff for me though. Look at this.

02:31:56
itsboek: what are we doin

02:32:01
<transcript>: It did it, it's doing it.

02:32:04
<transcript>: They don't look like LeBron.

02:32:06
<transcript>: But.

02:32:09
<transcript>: It's doing something.

02:32:11
<transcript>: This is fun.

02:32:17
<transcript>: I'm having fun? Are you having fun? I'm having fun.

02:32:23
<transcript>: I may have used bad reference images, just a lot of reasons. This could have been.

02:32:26
<transcript>: A bad model, right.

02:32:28
<transcript>: What is this? Prompt.

02:32:36
<transcript>: Fluid swirl masses of Burgundy oil paints. I think all of these are still kind of working themselves out, right.

02:32:47
<transcript>: What are we doing.

02:32:50
<transcript>: Well, we're playing with stable diffusion.

02:32:52
<transcript>: We're trying to.

02:32:55
<transcript>: Create.

02:32:57
<transcript>: What is this? Prompt.

02:33:06
<transcript>: Fantastic handeyed cotton clothes and Belish beaded feather decorative fringe knocks colorful picked up man look at these props.

02:33:09
<transcript>: That's something.

02:33:12
<transcript>: We're trying to create.

02:33:15
<transcript>: Images of LeBron James Right now.

02:33:22
<transcript>: Like that's. These are something.

02:33:22
<transcript>: these are kind of leverage

02:33:23
<transcript>: These are kind of leverage.

02:33:28
<transcript>: The model's not very good. Clearly. We got a pretty poor model.

02:33:32
<transcript>: But.

02:33:32
<transcript>: it's

02:33:35
<transcript>: It's trying.

02:33:40
<transcript>: Yeah. These don't look like a Braun. It doesn't look like Dream Booth was even involved, does it.

02:33:40
<transcript>: i mean

02:33:44
<transcript>: I mean, I know it is. At least it said it was.

02:33:52
<transcript>: So that looks like LeBron. A little bit.

02:33:52
<transcript>: like a young little

02:33:54
<transcript>: Like a young little bronze.

02:33:59
<transcript>: But largely it doesn't feel like.

02:33:59
<transcript>: it

02:34:01
<transcript>: It. That's a very good model.

02:34:06
<transcript>: Okay.

02:34:09
<transcript>: Was this.

02:34:19
<transcript>: Let's let's get it running on our own.

02:34:19
<transcript>: cloud

02:34:21
<transcript>: Cloud infrastructure. I want more control.

02:34:25
<transcript>: Did they just, like, give it to me.

02:34:27
<transcript>: No.

02:34:27
<transcript>: we got

02:34:30
<transcript>: We got a lot of work to do before ready for it anyway.

02:34:39
<transcript>: I want a Docker file. He this person used.

02:34:39
<transcript>: they link

02:34:42
<transcript>: They linked it. Where was it.

02:34:45
<transcript>: Said it was two steps.

02:34:45
<transcript>: yeah

02:34:47
<transcript>: Yeah. Here we go.

02:34:47
<transcript>: stable

02:34:50
<transcript>: Stable Diffusion Web, UI, Docker.

02:34:54
<transcript>: Easy Docker setup for stable fusion with user friendly.

02:34:57
<transcript>: So they've got.

02:35:02
<transcript>: Data output, screens, services.

02:35:07
<transcript>: Elstein there's a Docker file.

02:35:12
<transcript>: So from Miniconda.

02:35:17
<transcript>: I.

02:35:20
<transcript>: Think we could do this.

02:35:32
<transcript>: I think we could write our own darker file here. So this one's using invoke AI. There's just so many flavors all ready. I guess this the whole point of using Invoke AI is to get their Web UI right.

02:35:37
<transcript>: Okay. Let's do this. Let's.

02:35:42
<transcript>: Create a.

02:35:47
<transcript>: Doctor file.

02:35:51
<transcript>: And.

02:35:51
<transcript>: let

02:35:53
<transcript>: Let.

02:35:55
<transcript>: 's Start typing. Stuff.

02:35:55
<transcript>: it's

02:36:01
<transcript>: It's time, time. Start typing so we can use this one as a starting point. I don't know that I'm gonna like.

02:36:03
<transcript>: What we got here.

02:36:05
<transcript>: But.

02:36:14
<transcript>: It's more than what I have currently. So Docker, Docker valve. Ours is not going to be from mini condo, right? It's gonna be from one of these images.

02:36:17
<transcript>: One of these images? Nope.

02:36:17
<transcript>: these images

02:36:21
<transcript>: These images. So we have hugging phase training containers.

02:36:26
<transcript>: Pytorch with hugging face Transformers I know that comes into play.

02:36:26
<transcript>: i wonder if you didn't want

02:36:32
<transcript>: I wonder if you didn't want to search. I wonder if anyone had an issue on here or something for stable diffusion.

02:36:37
dedadev: Hi, do you have an issue with loc.log file?

02:36:42
<transcript>: This is just our list of basic images that will work.

02:36:42
<transcript>: on

02:36:44
<transcript>: On our AWS instances, right.

02:36:51
dedadev: lsp.log*

02:36:53
<transcript>: Thanks for following Shrump.

02:36:57
<transcript>: Miss that nine minutes ago. Sorry about that.

02:37:06
<transcript>: So we have so many.

02:37:06
<transcript>: we have just been

02:37:07
<transcript>: We have just been.

02:37:07
<transcript>: pytorch

02:37:09
<transcript>: Pytorch.

02:37:11
<transcript>: Base images.

02:37:11
<transcript>: here

02:37:17
<transcript>: Here's Graviton with PyTorch. So that's a good candidate if we don't find something more specific.

02:37:19
<transcript>: Something like this.

02:37:26
<transcript>: Let's Python, three, eight. Everything I've seen is three, nine.

02:37:32
<transcript>: There we go. Tensorflow. Three, nine.

02:37:35
<transcript>: We don't need TensorFlow.

02:37:43
<transcript>: Does any do any of the.

02:37:50
<transcript>: Pie torch ones used through that knife.

02:37:50
<transcript>: i don't see

02:37:52
<transcript>: I don't see any.

02:38:05
<transcript>: Other pietorch ones are three, eight.

02:38:15
<transcript>: Hi. Do you have an issue with locked lock log file? I don't know what that is.

02:38:15
<transcript>: honestly

02:38:15
cowfacedude99: btw I forgot to ask. what responded when you said `ok google`? that was really funny LUL

02:38:22
<transcript>: Honestly, I have no idea what that is. So now I don't have any issues with it. I forgot to ask what responded when you said okay, Google it was going.

02:38:23
ghostmarcel18: Sup

02:38:27
<transcript>: It was actually just a joke.

02:38:31
ghostmarcel18: Am new

02:38:34
<transcript>: I don't even have Google plugged in. Usually I plugged it in just for that just to do that little joke.

02:38:34
<transcript>: because

02:38:36
ghostmarcel18: How you doin

02:38:36
dedadev: you don't use lsp?

02:38:38
<transcript>: Because I did use that to me all the time, like on phone calls.

02:38:38
<transcript>: my whole team

02:38:40
<transcript>: My whole team at St.

02:38:40
<transcript>: stexa devices

02:38:41
<transcript>: Stexa, devices.

02:38:41
<transcript>: anytime

02:38:47
schrompp: what do you think will be the cost for hosting this on aws?

02:38:47
<transcript>: Anytime we talked about, like most son. Alexa, I like what would pop in.

02:38:50
<transcript>: Don't you use LSP. I do.

02:38:57
<transcript>: Lsp lock dot log file comes into play oh LSP log.

02:38:57
<transcript>: i have an

02:39:00
<transcript>: I have an issue with Lspda log. I don't know. Do I.

02:39:04
<transcript>: Shrimp. Welcome to chat.

02:39:07
<transcript>: Ghost Marcel. Welcome to Chat, as well.

02:39:07
<transcript>: and new how am i doing

02:39:19
<transcript>: And new. How am I doing? I'm doing well, what do I think the cost for hosting this on AWS will be depending on what size of an instance we run. I'm not building this for other people. It'll just be for me to play with.

02:39:22
<transcript>: So it'll just be a single instance.

02:39:25
<transcript>: I'll probably be like a Fargate service.

02:39:25
<transcript>: and

02:39:26
<transcript>: And.

02:39:26
<transcript>: i don't know

02:39:28
<transcript>: I don't know how many.

02:39:39
<transcript>: But I have like thousands of dollars in credits that I have to spend at some point. So I'll probably just be using a Tobis credits for a while.

02:39:41
caldotjs: @caldotjs makes sense! do you mind to whisper me yours. Home-manager is still being iffy

02:39:44
<transcript>: Okay. I'm.

02:39:47
<transcript>: Wonder how they're yeah, I wonder what the economics of this.

02:39:52
<transcript>: Astria was it their stuff. Looks like.

02:39:53
ghostmarcel18: What is game going to be about

02:39:58
<transcript>: How affordable is their model training process.

02:40:06
<transcript>: But this is largely what I imagine, like just the ability to.

02:40:09
<transcript>: Drag some images.

02:40:13
<transcript>: Have it trained a new model and then.

02:40:15
<transcript>: Get portrait back.

02:40:15
<transcript>: but

02:40:22
<transcript>: But like, not have to mess with like, prompts. Maybe you could have the ability to miss the prompts, but I like what they did here, just like prejudice. A bunch of them.

02:40:22
<transcript>: they're not

02:40:26
<transcript>: They're not any good, but I think that's the model's fault. I don't think that's.

02:40:26
<transcript>: their prompt

02:40:29
<transcript>: Their prompt. I don't think it's the prompts. Fault.

02:40:34
<transcript>: So.

02:40:34
<transcript>: we gotta figure

02:40:36
<transcript>: We gotta figure out.

02:40:43
<transcript>: What is the best base image? I think the best base image is just a Pi torch. So that's Pi torch 111. In this case.

02:40:43
<transcript>: let's

02:40:47
<transcript>: Let's see if it says in here.

02:40:47
<transcript>: yeah one

02:40:52
<transcript>: Yeah, 111. Here we go. But it's Python. Three, eight.

02:40:52
<transcript>: i feel like

02:40:54
<transcript>: I feel like all this stuff has been.

02:40:58
<transcript>: Yeah, Python, Three, nine.

02:41:06
<transcript>: Just fine. We can extend I mean, that's the whole thing like we can extend the base image. Right. And we can install Python three, nine if we need to.

02:41:11
stroopwafel26: are you streaming tomorrow as well?

02:41:14
<transcript>: Kudotlekit eleven, three. I assume all of these have the Kuda toolkit already.

02:41:17
<transcript>: I don't know.

02:41:21
<transcript>: Yesteroop, I'll be soon tomorrow.

02:41:21
<transcript>: i don't know tomorrow

02:41:24
<transcript>: I don't know tomorrow tomorrow we might be doing AW guess instead of.

02:41:24
<transcript>: this stuff but

02:41:25
<transcript>: This stuff. But.

02:41:33
stroopwafel26: cool cool

02:41:36
<transcript>: What is game going to be about.

02:41:36
<transcript>: ghost marcel

02:41:37
<transcript>: Ghost Marcel.

02:41:37
<transcript>: the

02:41:42
<transcript>: The AW guest game is like an AWS guessing game you see like a DBS services.

02:41:46
<transcript>: And yes figure out which one it is based on the image.

02:41:53
ghostmarcel18: Oh oke

02:41:57
ghostmarcel18: Seems fun

02:41:58
<transcript>: So I'm gonna need them to give me.

02:42:03
<transcript>: Gpu instances before I can really.

02:42:06
<transcript>: Run. Anything.

02:42:06
<transcript>: but i

02:42:08
<transcript>: But I would like to start.

02:42:11
stroopwafel26: tomorrow is my daughters' 2nd birthday \o/

02:42:12
<transcript>: Let's just pick one.

02:42:12
<transcript>: let's

02:42:15
<transcript>: Let's just pick a pietorch. Eleven.

02:42:20
<transcript>: Inference.

02:42:25
<transcript>: Horror VOD options? Oh Geez sewing over my head.

02:42:34
<transcript>: That's prior.

02:42:41
<transcript>: I think the hugging face thing is promising because I definitely saw hugging face.

02:42:41
<transcript>: here

02:42:42
<transcript>: Here.

02:42:50
<transcript>: That's the way it's downloaded on hugging face.

02:42:53
<transcript>: So.

02:42:53
<transcript>: so maybe

02:43:01
<transcript>: So maybe we start with one of these. How do you hugging face inference containers versus HuggingFace training containers? So I guess we'll have.

02:43:01
<transcript>: we'll have

02:43:02
<transcript>: We'll have a training.

02:43:09
<transcript>: We'll have training instance, and we'll have an inference instance, I guess.

02:43:11
<transcript>: I suppose.

02:43:16
<transcript>: High Torch 110.

02:43:23
<transcript>: Maybe some trial and error here.

02:43:27
<transcript>: Triton Inference containers.

02:43:29
<transcript>: Sage maker know.

02:43:32
<transcript>: Graviton is more efficient.

02:43:32
<transcript>: those are

02:43:35
<transcript>: Those are all CPU. Okay.

02:43:35
<transcript>: now

02:43:36
<transcript>: Now.

02:43:39
<transcript>: Ec, two.

02:43:46
<transcript>: Okay. Well, we need to just pick something.

02:43:49
<transcript>: Just to start writing out this Docker file, right.

02:43:51
<transcript>: So then.

02:43:58
<transcript>: These URLs only change the region, right.

02:44:00
<transcript>: Believe.

02:44:02
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:44:02
<transcript>: okay

02:44:03
<transcript>: Okay.

02:44:06
<transcript>: Let's let's do this.

02:44:10
<transcript>: Let's.

02:44:12
<transcript>: Choose.

02:44:21
<transcript>: Tryton Habana auto glue on hugging face.

02:44:28
<transcript>: Last.

02:44:40
<transcript>: Okay. I think of all these. It's either hugging face.

02:44:45
<transcript>: Or just the EC, two.

02:44:48
<transcript>: Might just use the EC two framework.

02:44:50
<transcript>: Container.

02:44:55
<transcript>: So these have Pi torch. We want what version of PyTorch.

02:45:05
<transcript>: Open up the original. Here we go.

02:45:06
andreull: Hi Adam. how's the awguess project going?

02:45:09
<transcript>: Pytorch.

02:45:14
<transcript>: Does it matter? Maybe doesn't matter.

02:45:29
<transcript>: Yaml. Maybe we'll just look at environment on YAML. So that tells us what we're here we go dependencies.

02:45:29
<transcript>: kuda

02:45:33
<transcript>: Kuda Toolkit Eleven, Three Pi torch, 111.

02:45:38
<transcript>: Okay.

02:45:45
<transcript>: I'm actually surprised they don't just provide like a Docker file. Seems like the kind of thing you would.

02:45:51
<transcript>: Andre A to be a guess is going well we're staying a little break today doing some AI stuff.

02:45:57
tiredbeaver: it's probably setup.py

02:45:59
<transcript>: Stroop. Your daughter turns to tomorrow.

02:45:59
<transcript>: my

02:46:00
<transcript>: My.

02:46:00
tiredbeaver: that you run to get things setup

02:46:03
<transcript>: My youngest, my boy.

02:46:06
<transcript>: My other boy got two boys.

02:46:06
<transcript>: my little

02:46:09
<transcript>: My little one turns three on Saturday.

02:46:12
itsboek: @stroopwafel26 hyyype

02:46:14
<transcript>: Set up Pi.

02:46:14
itsboek: congrats

02:46:19
<transcript>: pius

02:46:19
<transcript>: pius has

02:46:22
<transcript>: Pius has the Python abenities.

02:46:30
<transcript>: Oh, this is Dream Boost, stable diffusion.

02:46:31
stroopwafel26: 3! times flies

02:46:33
<transcript>: And this is what we're gonna run.

02:46:34
stroopwafel26: time*

02:46:38
<transcript>: Time wise really does.

02:46:38
<transcript>: because

02:46:42
<transcript>: Because seven year old and now an almost three year old.

02:46:45
<transcript>: Okay.

02:46:48
<transcript>: So.

02:46:55
<transcript>: This Ashra is pretty good. I don't know. Like it's not clear to me how would make.

02:46:55
<transcript>: this better

02:47:00
<transcript>: This better how would make the model better like this? Dream be model is not very good.

02:47:00
<transcript>: it's just not clear

02:47:03
<transcript>: It's just not clear to me. I think it's the training images. I think these are terrible.

02:47:05
andreull: is the repo public? i'd love to take a look at it to learn some things

02:47:08
<transcript>: You can even tell like how pixelated it might be because the training images are too small.

02:47:08
tiredbeaver: i think time flies when you think about time with specific points in mind

02:47:11
<transcript>: I did figure out that he's always in the Laker strategies.

02:47:15
<transcript>: This doesn't look like his face. Right.

02:47:15
<transcript>: that's

02:47:18
<transcript>: That's almost looks like his face.

02:47:24
<transcript>: But it doesn't really so.

02:47:27
<transcript>: Is there a reason.

02:47:33
<transcript>: To take a look at it you mean AW guess I believe.

02:47:35
<transcript>: Eight of you guess.

02:47:38
<transcript>: Github.

02:47:38
andreull: yes

02:47:39
<transcript>: Com.

02:47:44
<transcript>: Aw, guess. Yeah, it should be public. Yeah, that's right there.

02:47:48
<transcript>: It's a T three stack app.

02:47:48
<transcript>: wow

02:47:56
<transcript>: Wow. I haven't pushed to the Revo in 20 days, so we've done quite a bit of stuff with like, X state. We've been messing with stuff that we haven't pushed yet.

02:47:56
<transcript>: okay

02:47:57
<transcript>: Okay.

02:47:57
<transcript>: so

02:47:58
<transcript>: So.

02:48:03
<transcript>: Yeah. Like $3 per subject. I don't know.

02:48:03
<transcript>: does that pay

02:48:07
<transcript>: Does that pay for what you're really spent, training it.

02:48:09
<transcript>: I wonder.

02:48:22
<transcript>: You like listening to me suck up Bubbles? Is that some ASMR.

02:48:34
<transcript>: Basic image.

02:48:39
<transcript>: I'm just hoping this gets like right.

02:48:41
<transcript>: Now at AWS.

02:48:44
<transcript>: I want to try and pull a string.

02:48:46
<transcript>: Here we go.

02:48:46
<transcript>: aws

02:48:48
<transcript>: Aws, hero.

02:48:48
<transcript>: boost here

02:48:49
<transcript>: Boost here.

02:48:56
<transcript>: Okay. No joke. I'm gonna try.

02:48:59
<transcript>: I'm gonna go.

02:49:02
<transcript>: Pixelated mode.

02:49:02
<transcript>: i'm gonna

02:49:04
<transcript>: I'm gonna see.

02:49:06
<transcript>: If I can get a quicker.

02:49:06
<transcript>: quicker peek

02:49:09
<transcript>: Quicker peek at this support thing.

02:49:13
<transcript>: Where do I want to do this.

02:49:15
<transcript>: Ten technical.

02:49:15
<transcript>: so there

02:49:18
<transcript>: So there's like a heroes slack.

02:49:18
<transcript>: and i'm

02:49:21
<transcript>: And I'm gonna try.

02:49:26
<transcript>: Gonna try to get.

02:49:29
<transcript>: Some eyes on this support request.

02:49:33
<transcript>: I don't know. Is that like wrong? Should I not do stuff like that.

02:49:36
<transcript>: Does that bother anybody? Ethically.

02:49:40
<transcript>: I don't want to ruffle any feathers here.

02:49:45
<transcript>: I'm trying to find the list of channels.

02:49:45
<transcript>: browse

02:49:47
<transcript>: Browse. Can I browse.

02:49:50
<transcript>: Show.

02:49:52
<transcript>: All channels.

02:49:56
<transcript>: I want to view.

02:49:56
<transcript>: ad channel

02:49:59
<transcript>: Ad Channels. Here we go. Browse Channels. There we go.

02:50:01
<transcript>: Support.

02:50:02
stroopwafel26: My daughter is getting a play kitchen for her birthday, I'm gonna assemble it tonight so she sees it when she gets out of bed tomorrow

02:50:07
<transcript>: Tanner, Heroes General Technical Booster serverless.

02:50:11
<transcript>: I'm gonna go into a channel. Here.

02:50:14
<transcript>: I'm gonna ask.

02:50:22
stroopwafel26: I have a huge box in my office right now lmao

02:50:25
<transcript>: Where I should do this.

02:50:55
<transcript>: Actually, I'm a Senate DM.

02:50:55
<transcript>: see this

02:50:56
<transcript>: See this.

02:51:30
<transcript>: I'm asking questions.

02:51:33
<transcript>: Let's see if I could answers.

02:51:37
<transcript>: Okay, I can take it off. Fuzzy.

02:51:39
<transcript>: So.

02:51:48
<transcript>: If this could come through, then we could start playing. We could just start, like spinning up an easy two service or an ECS service.

02:51:48
<transcript>: let's

02:51:51
<transcript>: Let's do this. Let's. So we've got a fake Docker file here.

02:51:51
<transcript>: let's

02:51:53
<transcript>: Let's.

02:51:55
<transcript>: Delete. This.

02:52:04
<transcript>: So we've got a Docker file. We're going to we're gonna make this a CDK app.

02:52:12
<transcript>: I'm gonna do MPX, wait, what.

02:52:16
<transcript>: 's.

02:52:18
<transcript>: All this.

02:52:21
<transcript>: I'm tracked files.

02:52:28
<transcript>: Access get ignore to be able to smoke links.

02:52:32
<transcript>: Jumping out of my.

02:52:34
<transcript>: Oh.

02:52:45
<transcript>: Okay.

02:52:48
<transcript>: I want to do.

02:52:57
<transcript>: Mpx CDK, no, Create, what is it? Mpx CDK.

02:53:19
<transcript>: I'm gonna assemble it tonight. So she sees it when she's out of bed tomorrow. That's always the best when they come out. And there's the thing I love that have a huge box of Mobs right now. Yeah, I've been there.

02:53:22
<transcript>: Also play Kitchens. Big hit.

02:53:22
<transcript>: this is

02:53:27
<transcript>: This is the Ative Kit Version Two Developer guide. Yep, that's what we want.

02:53:31
<transcript>: I want to do MPX CDK.

02:53:42
<transcript>: Cdk app no.

02:53:46
<transcript>: Bootstraping no. Create a new app. Here we go.

02:53:47
stroopwafel26: she loves the play kitchen at daycare and you can keep buying addons for it

02:53:50
<transcript>: Cdk and Knit. That's what I'm looking for. Mpx.

02:54:01
<transcript>: Cdk. Net. Is It's language.

02:54:03
<transcript>: That language.

02:54:05
<transcript>: Typescript.

02:54:10
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:54:17
<transcript>: I'll be running a non empty directory. Oh, right, right.

02:54:21
<transcript>: So we're just gonna have to remove Dr. Bile. We'll recreate it. That's fine.

02:54:29
<transcript>: We're gonna define all the infrastructure in the CDK.

02:54:32
<transcript>: I would use SST.

02:54:35
<transcript>: Or architect, but I don't think.

02:54:35
<transcript>: they do

02:54:37
<transcript>: They do the Fargate stuff.

02:54:42
<transcript>: Something they're correctly focused on serverless use cases.

02:54:46
<transcript>: And while this isn't.

02:54:48
<transcript>: It's not like.

02:54:48
<transcript>: easy to inst

02:54:53
<transcript>: Easy to instances we are working with Fargate at least still not really like a service use case.

02:54:57
<transcript>: Duh duh duh cannot make changes. Modifiable off what.

02:55:00
<transcript>: Okay. So we made a CDK app.

02:55:00
<transcript>: and

02:55:03
<transcript>: And now we're going to.

02:55:09
<transcript>: What we're gonna open up.

02:55:14
<transcript>: Lib we have dream booth.

02:55:14
<transcript>: there's a single

02:55:16
<transcript>: There's a single stack.

02:55:16
<transcript>: cool

02:55:19
<transcript>: Cool no Es link configuration found.

02:55:21
<transcript>: In.

02:55:21
<transcript>: playground

02:55:23
<transcript>: Playground playground dream booth bin.

02:55:23
<transcript>: okay

02:55:25
<transcript>: Okay.

02:55:25
<transcript>: okay

02:55:26
<transcript>: Okay.

02:55:32
<transcript>: I mean, I have slant. Okay, that's sucks.

02:55:36
<transcript>: Pdk? Eslant? What's? Let's do this.

02:55:39
<transcript>: I think I remember this last time I set up.

02:55:46
<transcript>: So I set up a new CDK project.

02:55:49
<transcript>: Type script.

02:55:55
<transcript>: Yes, Lent. I just want to basic eslant rules.

02:55:55
<transcript>: basic

02:55:57
<transcript>: Basic eslant config.

02:55:57
<transcript>: for my cdk

02:55:59
<transcript>: For my CDK app.

02:55:59
<transcript>: what's that gonna

02:56:01
<transcript>: What's that gonna take.

02:56:08
<transcript>: What's it going to take? I know there's this plugin. I guess that's I should just go that plugins stuff.

02:56:11
<transcript>: Here.

<transcript>: I want to use pnpm.

02:56:30
<transcript>: Want to use Pnpm. Delete because I don't think I'm gonna have any Lambda functions where I'm gonna have issues with the s build.

02:56:30
<transcript>: bundling that's the only

02:56:34
<transcript>: Bundling that's the only reason I ever don't use Pnpm is.

02:56:42
<transcript>: Test Lib. I don't use it when.

02:56:52
<transcript>: I have to bundle Lambda functions. Type your blamed functions with es. Build. It does not. It does not work.

02:56:56
<transcript>: Pnpm does not handle that very well. Okay.

02:56:56
<transcript>: so

02:57:04
<transcript>: So we're using PMPM. Now I'm going to do PMPM install. Yes, link plugin.

cra5h16: :)

03:01:10
<transcript>: I wanted Ven mode. I just. I keep forgetting that the icon changes and which one is which Dev depends. So everything's good. Now I think everything's good. We got all the dependencies.

03:01:10
<transcript>: so

03:01:17
<transcript>: So now if I look at our package JSON, we've got Dev dependencies node prettier.

03:01:17
<transcript>: techscript

03:01:24
<transcript>: Techscript Dslnt ESL plugin type script Dslnt parser we've got the excellent plugin CDK. Now let's do this.

03:01:57
<transcript>: I'm just gonna copy all this stuff.

03:02:04
<transcript>: Okay.

03:02:08

03:03:15
<transcript>: I'm just. I'm using this as a cheap way to restart it as well. So I'm getting the latest.

03:03:18
<transcript>: And then I'm hoping that'll restart it.

03:03:25
<transcript>: Sorry? What.

03:03:30
caldotjs: :!eslint_d restart

<transcript>: Okay prettiers working that's good import is reserved.

03:04:39
<transcript>: How do you figure? What.

03:04:49
<transcript>: This a problem? Do I need to configure? I probably need to configure TypeScript. Eslanta. Hideous lent. This is why DAX doesn't use it. Because it's just bad.

03:04:55
<transcript>: See a Stroop? Yes. Lint? D? Restart. I'll. Thank you, Caldot. Let's try that.

03:05:00
<transcript>: This length, the restart. I mean, at this point I don't know if a restart is the problem.

03:05:07
<transcript>: It's like it's not getting one of these called these shibangs.

03:05:07
<transcript>: it's

03:05:10

03:05:21
<transcript>: Keyword import is reserved.

03:05:21
cowfacedude99: it's called shabang LUL

<transcript>: I think it's reserved for exactly what I'm using for which is importing things.

03:05:29
<transcript>: Right.

03:05:31
<transcript>: Shebang.

03:05:31
<transcript>: thank you god

<transcript>: Let's.

03:05:41
<transcript>: wow just getting

<transcript>: Wow, just getting a CDK project started. Turns out paintful.

03:05:46
<transcript>: couldn't be

03:05:48
<transcript>: Couldn't be.

03:05:50
<transcript>: Shouldn't be painful.

03:05:50
<transcript>: it turns

03:05:58
<transcript>: It turns out a little painful. I think I need to do the TypeScript via slant thing. I hate this. I hateously. Why do I even use it.

03:06:03
<transcript>: Why do I even use it? I just want a basic ESLint config. Where is that.

03:06:03
<transcript>: someone give me that

03:06:04
<transcript>: Someone give me that.

03:06:06
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow. Funk.

03:06:08
cowfacedude99: do you want to try the require syntax? LUL

03:06:08
<transcript>: You must also hate.

03:06:13
<transcript>: US also hate eslant.

03:06:13
<transcript>: try

03:06:17
<transcript>: Try the require syntax. I hope I don't have to use requirements.

03:06:17
<transcript>: i mean

03:06:19
<transcript>: I mean this is a.

03:06:32
<transcript>: Look at our TS config Target 2018 comedy US I hate all this stuff. I hate TypeScript. Plus Eslant every single time it drives me nuts get started.

03:06:32
<transcript>: okay

03:06:38
<transcript>: Okay. We installed the parser. We installed the plugin. We installed typescripts. We have all of those installed.

03:06:38
<transcript>: next create escape

03:06:39
<transcript>: Next create escape.

03:06:39
<transcript>: rc

03:06:41
<transcript>: Rc, five.

03:06:41
<transcript>: and

03:06:44
<transcript>: And extends ESL. Recommended.

03:06:50
<transcript>: Okay, we're gonna do all this. I think this is the issue.

03:06:59
<transcript>: So it's going to be extend.

03:07:03
<transcript>: Right.

03:07:03
<transcript>: oh but

03:07:05
<transcript>: Oh, but I'm not doing.

03:07:09
<transcript>: I'm not doing.

03:07:13
neochromer: @adamdotdev try SWC

03:07:15
cowfacedude99: eslint and webpack are two things that you don't want to touch LUL

03:07:15
<transcript>: So. No, actually, I want to do the CS. Okay, let's see if I can figure this out. I want to.

03:07:15
<transcript>: wrap

03:07:16
neochromer: instead of TSC

03:07:19
<transcript>: Wrap extends so I'm gonna do CS W.

03:07:24
<transcript>: Nope, definitely not at.

03:07:24
<transcript>: i was trying

03:07:25
neochromer: nvm

03:07:27
<transcript>: I was trying to. Oh, what am I doing.

03:07:28
neochromer: its not yur issue

03:07:29
<transcript>: Trying to wrap.

03:07:29

<transcript>: in them surround

03:07:40
<transcript>: In them. Surround. We did it. People. Did you see this? Did you see this.

03:07:44
<transcript>: Yeah. Web packs don't want to touch that.

03:07:49
meduzyan: Pog

03:07:49
<transcript>: And Set, PSE.

03:07:57
cowfacedude99: one step at a time .....

03:07:58
<transcript>: I don't want to go that far off to beaten path. I don't think right now. So then all these, all these quotes should probably be.

03:08:03
<transcript>: Like this.

03:08:10
<transcript>: So now we're doing.

03:08:10
<transcript>: extend

03:08:15
<transcript>: Extend the Slant recommended plugin TypeScript ESLint and then we have to add parser.

03:08:20
<transcript>: Do we need to add this root true stuff.

03:08:29
<transcript>: I don't know, but I know on this one we're gonna do Ysa W quote no.

03:08:30
cowfacedude99: you could do substitute. :s/'/"/g one liner

03:08:30
<transcript>: Read me wrong.

03:08:32
gigo6000: you could do cs'"

03:08:34
<transcript>: Ysaw quote Yes.

03:08:40
<transcript>: Feels good.

03:08:50
<transcript>: There's a parser, and then we need to add the plugin.

03:08:52
gigo6000: for the single quotes to double quotes

03:08:55
<transcript>: Type script at type.

03:08:55
<transcript>: script

03:08:57
<transcript>: Script.

03:08:59
<transcript>: Yes, Lant.

03:09:04
<transcript>: Like that.

03:09:04
<transcript>: zoom

03:09:05
<transcript>: Zoom.

03:09:15
<transcript>: US set up for TypeScript and CDK root. Do we want to do the root true thing? I guess we'll do root true.

03:09:18
<transcript>: Okay.

03:09:21
<transcript>: Let's see how we're looking now.

03:09:26
<transcript>: Are we looking now.

03:09:26
<transcript>: i'll see restart

03:09:30
<transcript>: I'll see restart. I don't know if it is. I don't think it Mason.

03:09:35
<transcript>: Restart. Now. Is this LSP. It's no LS that I use.

03:09:40
<transcript>: Let's do the ESLint. Yes.

03:09:42

03:09:47
<transcript>: Calbot ESLint B. Restart.

03:09:52

03:10:02
<transcript>: Let's open it, back up.

03:10:02
<transcript>: i am running

03:10:06
<transcript>: I am running like late of everything so it's possible.

03:10:06
<transcript>: oh

03:10:07
<transcript>: Oh.

03:10:07
<transcript>: no

03:10:10
<transcript>: No more valid. Oh, I think we did it Oh.

03:10:10
<transcript>: could not find the

03:10:14
<transcript>: Could not find the declaration file for source. I don't care about that.

03:10:14
<transcript>: hey

03:10:16
<transcript>: Hey, hey, Hey.

03:10:17
<transcript>: We did it.

03:10:24
<transcript>: Okay, we did it. Guys, we're now, guys and girls, we are now.

03:10:35
<transcript>: Funny YouTube analytics say that a 100% of my viewers. I mean, we're talking about like a few hundred. Well, 100% of them are male. I don't know if that's true, but.

03:10:35
<transcript>: we gotta do better

03:10:37
<transcript>: We gotta do better how do we do better.

03:10:37
<transcript>: how do we get more

03:10:38
cowfacedude99: `and we don't know how LUL`

03:10:38
<transcript>: How do we get more.

03:10:38
<transcript>: females

03:10:41
<transcript>: Females, viewership.

03:10:47
<transcript>: I'm only aware of one female that's ever hung out here in chat with us. And that was Mandy.

03:10:47
<transcript>: there may be

03:10:49
<transcript>: There may be more other others.

03:10:56
<transcript>: Speaking of Whoa, dude, thanks for the follow. Also, funk. If I didn't say that her there. Welcome to Chat. Crash.

03:11:01
<transcript>: Was your Get Folder set.

03:11:18
<transcript>: She bang. Okay. One step at a time. You could do substitute SCE. I could have done that. That's true. And CS instead of YS. What is the difference? I forget with envy. Surround CS. Oh, CS changes it right. Ys is add new. Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

03:11:22
<transcript>: We don't know how low.

03:11:26
<transcript>: Okay.

03:11:32
<transcript>: Let's see if we can run CDK since.

03:11:36
<transcript>: It's not installed. We're gonna do.

03:11:36
<transcript>: ck

03:11:38
<transcript>: Ck since.

03:11:42
<transcript>: Let's see if it's all works.

03:11:42
<transcript>: we should

03:11:48
<transcript>: We should have a baseline. Yeah. Okay. So we can we can run CDK set. Cool, cool, cool.

03:11:48
<transcript>: now we're

03:12:00
<transcript>: Now we're gonna find like Fargate services and stuff like that. Let's see if my case ID is moved forward. I thought these moved really fast if it's just like I want GPU instances. Thanks for the following.

03:12:00
<transcript>: sidey

03:12:06
<transcript>: Sidey sidee I'm gonna go super secret fuzzy mode for some.

03:12:08
<transcript>: Answers.

03:12:08
<transcript>: two more questions

03:12:09
<transcript>: Two more questions.

03:12:09
<transcript>: no

03:12:14
<transcript>: No may not get any preferential hero treatment that's fine.

03:12:14
<transcript>: that's fine

03:12:16
<transcript>: That's fine.

03:12:19
<transcript>: Heroes should be able to sort it out on their own.

03:12:19
<transcript>: i can sort it out

03:12:29
<transcript>: I can sort it out. I just would hate if I wait forever and I don't get a response here and we have to end the stream with underway output. I really want to get somewhere. You know, I'm saying.

03:12:34
<transcript>: So let's start building out a Fargate service CDK Fargate.

03:12:36
<transcript>: Load balance.

03:12:36
<transcript>: fargate

03:12:41
<transcript>: Fargate service there's like a construct for this. Yeah, yeah, it's this one right here.

03:12:41
<transcript>: it's this

03:12:43
<transcript>: It's this one.

03:12:43
<transcript>: v two

03:12:44
<transcript>: V. Two.

03:12:51
<transcript>: Ecs Patterns Application load balance Fargate Service You can point it at a container image.

03:12:54
<transcript>: Which can point to a Docker file.

03:12:58
<transcript>: Let's find some examples of that.

03:13:01
<transcript>: Let's find.

03:13:01
<transcript>: so far

03:13:03
<transcript>: So far get if you're not aware.

03:13:03
<transcript>: running

03:13:07
<transcript>: Running containers on AWS. There's a lot of ways.

03:13:07
<transcript>: too many ways

03:13:09
<transcript>: Too many ways one might say.

03:13:15
<transcript>: One of the ways is we sees Elastic Container service.

03:13:15
<transcript>: i think

03:13:17
<transcript>: I think ECS.

03:13:24
<transcript>: Things are the follow Kooli so with ECS, you can run two different.

03:13:24
<transcript>: run

03:13:28
<transcript>: Run like runtimes. Let me just go to the let's just go to ETS.

03:13:28
khoulyy: is this brave browser ?

03:13:32
<transcript>: Last Container service.

03:13:32
<transcript>: is this brave

03:13:34
<transcript>: Is this brave? No, this is a Chrome.

03:13:34
<transcript>: cooly

03:13:35
<transcript>: Cooly.

03:13:35
<transcript>: maybe i should

03:13:41
<transcript>: Maybe I should use Brave. I hear that I should so you can have services.

03:13:41
<transcript>: let's see

03:13:45
<transcript>: Let's see clusters, tasks, definitions. So.

03:13:47
<transcript>: You define a task.

03:13:47
<transcript>: you can you

03:13:50
<transcript>: You can you can run those tasks in one of two modes.

03:14:08
<transcript>: Ec two mode is like you have to manage the underlying cluster, all the instances that make up your cluster. So you have to actually manage like EC two instances. And then there's Fargate mode where it's like run it. It's kind of serverless e, like run it. I don't want to think about the underlying infrastructure.

03:14:15
<transcript>: That's said for GPU instances, I don't know if we can do Fargate.

03:14:18
<transcript>: Past definition.

03:14:23
<transcript>: If you instant I can't remember if you can tell it what kind of instances to use.

03:14:26
<transcript>: Can't remember.

03:14:28
<transcript>: If you can't.

03:14:31
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. So you can define.

03:14:31
<transcript>: which types

03:14:34
<transcript>: Which types of instances at least.

03:14:40
<transcript>: Designate a number of GPUs in your task definition. For Task Place Acceleration a container level.

03:14:40
<transcript>: ecs schedule

03:14:46
<transcript>: Ecs schedules to available GPU enabled container instances and pins difficulty views proper containers for optimal performance.

03:14:51
<transcript>: Okay. So I believe I can do that with Fargate. I believe.

03:14:54
<transcript>: Our gate.

03:14:54
<transcript>: i will see

03:14:57
<transcript>: I will see here when we define our application.

03:14:57
<transcript>: load balanced

03:14:59
<transcript>: Load balanced, Fargate service.

03:15:01
<transcript>: But first.

03:15:01
<transcript>: first

03:15:02
<transcript>: First.

03:15:08
<transcript>: I'm gonna take another break second.

03:15:14
<transcript>: So I will be right back.

03:15:21
<transcript>: And we're still waiting. Kind of waiting on AWS. So maybe give me access to EC two.

03:15:30
<transcript>: Gpu instances in this account I might have another account that already has it enabled. I don't know that I'd want to do anything in those accounts. So I've got a ton of credits in this account. So.

03:15:32
<transcript>: Take a break.

03:21:04
<transcript>: The.

03:21:04
<transcript>: my

03:21:06
<transcript>: My OBS today.

03:21:06
<transcript>: it's a wonder

03:21:17
<transcript>: It's a wonder I've streamed anything. It's a wonder this has worked at all because it is so messed up. My camera, my other camera, my third camera won't even like show up.

03:21:22
<transcript>: It's just messed up. There's some messed up stuff going on here. Alright.

03:21:30
<transcript>: I just rolled. I never see Kylie in her Shrew anymore. I just saw the like shoutouts for their animations. Miss those folks.

03:21:31
teej_dv: too much power on one stream, twitch won't allow it

03:21:39
<transcript>: That's the thing about streaming. You're just constantly falling in and out of love. It's like you get to know people and they just don't come again. And it's like.

03:21:41
<transcript>: I remember them.

03:21:44
<transcript>: And some of you around all the time.

03:21:44
<transcript>: that's nice

03:21:48
<transcript>: That's nice. I like those that are around all the time. I get to know you better.

03:21:50
psysde: like dating

03:21:56
<transcript>: Tee just here. Too much power on one stream. Twitch. One a lot. I guess so, man. My my OBS.

03:21:56
<transcript>: it's

03:21:57
<transcript>: It's.

03:21:57
<transcript>: struggling

03:21:58
caldotjs: any arounders in chat :>

03:21:59
<transcript>: Struggling today teach.

03:22:03
<transcript>: Just not looking good.

03:22:10
<transcript>: Let's make a let's make an ECS thing. Let's do this. Let's just see if AWS responded.

03:22:10
<transcript>: in the

03:22:12
<transcript>: In the time that we were.

03:22:12
<transcript>: taking a piece of

03:22:15
<transcript>: Taking a piece of B break. I'm guessing no.

03:22:16
delvoid: its Monday, its having a slow day

03:22:18
<transcript>: I would guess most likely. No.

03:22:18
<transcript>: i don't

03:22:22
<transcript>: I don't know if my AWS hero privilege gets me anything.

03:22:25
<transcript>: Doesn't seem so, though.

03:22:25
<transcript>: still

03:22:27
<transcript>: Still no response.

03:22:27
<transcript>: what a bummer

03:22:28
<transcript>: What a bummer.

03:22:31
<transcript>: Welcome to chap.

03:22:31
<transcript>: chapel

03:22:33
<transcript>: Chapel like dating.

03:22:37
teej_dv: aws hero? more like aws zero Kappa

03:22:39
<transcript>: Yeah, it's like dating. It's like dating your viewers.

03:22:39
<transcript>: just

03:22:44
<transcript>: Just when you start to like somebody, they just don't they just don't don't show up again.

03:22:46
<transcript>: Zero? Ouch.

03:22:51
<transcript>: Monday having a slow day to avoid.

03:22:55
<transcript>: Oh AWS is having a slow day maybe or OBS.

03:22:55
<transcript>: there's a lot of things

03:22:59
<transcript>: There's a lot of things having a slow day today tease. We made something today with.

03:23:01
<transcript>: This.

03:23:15
<transcript>: This is Horror show we're trying to play with stable diffusion and Dream Booth, you know, have you seen Dream Booth Peach on Twitter or elsewhere? Like Take Somebody's Face, put them in a lot of different contexts.

03:23:15
<transcript>: we're trying to do

03:23:17
teej_dv: yeah, i know both of those

03:23:19
<transcript>: We're trying to do with photos of LeBron James, professional basketball player.

03:23:19
<transcript>: not going well

03:23:22
<transcript>: Not going well. This was our first attempt.

03:23:27
teej_dv: oh, i've heard of him

03:23:27
oskrm: Howdy

03:23:30
<transcript>: You know both of those LeBron James and Stable Fusions DreamBooth.

03:23:34
<transcript>: So we're playing with this kind of, like, managed service that just does it for you.

03:23:35
oskrm: hey tj

03:23:41
<transcript>: And the model is bad. It's probably the training images I gave it. That's my guess.

03:23:45
<transcript>: It does not seem to have figured out what LeBron James looks like.

03:23:45
<transcript>: that's okay

03:23:55
<transcript>: That's okay. We're gonna keep trying. We're trying to do it like on our own. And I want to just build some stuff in AWS to train because I use.

03:24:03
<transcript>: I use a Mac, an M One Mac and it doesn't seem to be a great combination. Stay able to fusion and M one Max.

03:24:03
<transcript>: we're gonna run

03:24:06
<transcript>: We're gonna run it in AWS.

03:24:06
<transcript>: on

03:24:09
<transcript>: On some GPU enabled instances.

03:24:10
teej_dv: o/ oksr

03:24:12
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow melody Dev.

03:24:12
<transcript>: melody

03:24:13
oskrm: Try Korean LeBron James LUL

03:24:15
<transcript>: Melody military melody Dev.

03:24:18
<transcript>: Korean LeBron LeBron James.

03:24:21
<transcript>: Sounds good. We could try that.

03:24:21
<transcript>: thank you for the

03:24:24
melodydev: Those pics are cursed lmao

03:24:25
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow. Captain Corks and Coolies. I don't know if I already said those.

03:24:27
<transcript>: But thank you.

03:24:27
<transcript>: this picture curve

03:24:30
<transcript>: This picture curve? Yeah, they're pretty bad.

03:24:34
<transcript>: Okay. So what we want to do is define.

03:24:34
<transcript>: one of these things

03:24:36
<transcript>: One of these things.

03:24:36
<transcript>: ecs pat

03:24:39
<transcript>: Ecs patterns. So I think with the new.

03:24:39
<transcript>: with the new

03:24:42
<transcript>: With the new CDK, we can just say like Image import.

03:24:44
<transcript>: From.

03:24:44
<transcript>: abs

03:24:50
<transcript>: Abs CDK Lib I bet this is an Alpha package, though, isn't it? Is this an Alpha package.

03:24:54
<transcript>: No.

03:24:56
<transcript>: Maybe not.

03:24:58
<transcript>: Aws, CDK, Lib.

03:25:00
<transcript>: Aws.

03:25:04
<transcript>: Ecs patterns. Look at that.

03:25:04
<transcript>: i thought it was gonna

03:25:06
<transcript>: I thought it was gonna be one of the.

03:25:09
<transcript>: One ones you have to install.

03:25:09
<transcript>: like

03:25:10
<transcript>: Like.

03:25:10
<transcript>: manually

03:25:12
<transcript>: Manually.

03:25:12
<transcript>: we want

03:25:16
<transcript>: We want, what application? Load balanced.

03:25:16
<transcript>: fargate

03:25:18
<transcript>: Fargate service.

03:25:20
<transcript>: Like that.

03:25:24
<transcript>: We're gonna delete all this.

03:25:24
<transcript>: and we're gonna

03:25:27
<transcript>: And we're gonna say, Const.

03:25:27
<transcript>: service

03:25:33
oskrm: That's a Java name KEKW

03:25:33
<transcript>: Service equals new application load balance. Fargate service. That's a mouthful.

03:25:33
<transcript>: this

03:25:34
<transcript>: This.

03:25:34
<transcript>: service

03:25:36
<transcript>: Service.

03:25:36
<transcript>: and now

03:25:41
<transcript>: And now we pass another props. Best should define a cluster. We'll get to that.

03:25:47
<transcript>: Memory limit. Is this optional with the default to.

03:25:53
<transcript>: So I guess we do have to define some stuff here.

03:26:02
<transcript>: So this isn't. Yeah, it's kind of serverless, it's serverless e, but we do have to still tell it what these containers.

03:26:02
<transcript>: like how many

03:26:05
<transcript>: Like how many resources we need.

03:26:05
<transcript>: i'm

03:26:07
<transcript>: I'm gonna skip this.

03:26:13
<transcript>: I'm gonna skip it and we'll come back to it. Memory limit. Cpu.

03:26:15
<transcript>: Let's just put this in here for now.

03:26:17
<transcript>: Desired count.

03:26:17
<transcript>: is just

03:26:21
<transcript>: Is just gonna be one let's hike. How many.

03:26:21
<transcript>: containers

03:26:22
<transcript>: Containers. We weren't running.

03:26:26
<transcript>: So this thing's load balance it uses.

03:26:26
<transcript>: elvs or whatever

03:26:27
<transcript>: Elvs, or whatever.

03:26:27
<transcript>: albs i'm

03:26:36
<transcript>: Albs. I'm not sure task image options. So this is where we can specify an image. And up here, we're gonna do this.

03:26:36
<transcript>: like this

03:26:39
<transcript>: Like this. It's gonna be a new.

03:26:39
<transcript>: docker

03:26:42
<transcript>: Docker. What is it called? Docker? Image asset.

03:26:44
<transcript>: Like that.

03:26:44
<transcript>: or

03:26:48
<transcript>: Or it's it's actually from yeah, it's like.

03:26:54
<transcript>: It's gonna be this.

03:26:56
<transcript>: Oh.

03:26:59
<transcript>: No.

03:27:02
<transcript>: We'll look it up.

03:27:06
<transcript>: Tdk, Docker, Image, asset.

03:27:06
<transcript>: basically

03:27:10
<transcript>: Basically, we can point it to a Docker file in our file system.

03:27:10
<transcript>: and

03:27:18
<transcript>: And it'll package it up and push it to ECR, which is their container registry. Here we go. Docker, Image asset.

03:27:18
<transcript>: directory

03:27:22
<transcript>: Directory Docker file. Okay, so, like this.

03:27:22
<transcript>: so it is

03:27:24
<transcript>: So it is new.

03:27:24
<transcript>: is new

03:27:27
<transcript>: Is new depth like that new.

03:27:30
<transcript>: Like this.

03:27:33
<transcript>: This is gonna be our image.

03:27:36
<transcript>: Directory.

03:27:39
<transcript>: We'll just get to that in a second.

03:27:43
<transcript>: We're doing a whole lot of get to it later. Things, aren't we.

03:27:43
<transcript>: exclude

03:27:44
<transcript>: Exclude.

03:27:55
<transcript>: Out. Those seem sensible node modules. Yep. Don't want to put any of that stuff in there.

03:27:59
<transcript>: Exclude and then build.

03:27:59
<transcript>: our

03:28:00
<transcript>: Our.

03:28:00
woycieszko: Hey Adam

03:28:04
<transcript>: Stubbing this stuff out. So this is where we could specify.

03:28:04
<transcript>: things like

03:28:08
<transcript>: Things like next public tab. Obviously, we're not gonna have.

03:28:22
<transcript>: What is Next public? Exactly. This next public makes me think it's like, I mean, like, Next environment variables for, like, a Next JS app. Is that what they design? What they do is that they're doing.

03:28:25
woycieszko: problem with microphone

03:28:26
<transcript>: Tag manager URL.

03:28:33
<transcript>: I don't know. We're not gonna have any of those right now. I just wanted to know the shape of this thing so that's our image.

03:28:34
<transcript>: Bind is missing.

03:28:41
<transcript>: That's a Java name.

03:28:47
<transcript>: Problem with microphone oyster. There's a problem with my macrophone.

03:28:49
<transcript>: Can you all hear me.

03:28:49
<transcript>: test

03:28:52
<transcript>: Test test one, two.

03:28:54
teej_dv: don't think so on my end

03:28:55
<transcript>: How do you do.

03:28:56
captaincorkes: Sounds fine for me

03:28:57
<transcript>: Maybe refresh.

03:28:57
<transcript>: teach says

03:28:57
impostorengineer: don't think so

03:28:57
woycieszko: sometimes i dont know why

03:28:58
teej_dv: you sound silky smooth

03:28:59
<transcript>: Teach says no problem on his end.

03:28:59
<transcript>: sounds fine

03:29:03
<transcript>: Sounds fine. A Captain course. Welcome to Chat. Captain quarks.

03:29:06
<transcript>: Yeah. Maybe refresh it.

03:29:06
<transcript>: sounds silky

03:29:06
oskrm: 5/5 audio

03:29:13
<transcript>: Sounds silky smooths, says Tiege. Five out of five says, oh, scary. I'm gonna put these on my website.

03:29:16
mr_yan19: you sound beautiful  LUL

03:29:22
<transcript>: Like some have said, my audio sounds silky smooth, and then I sound beautiful.

03:29:22
<transcript>: five out

03:29:25
<transcript>: Five out of five. How does this? Asmr for you.

03:29:27
<transcript>: You like that.

03:29:31
<transcript>: That Lar bar opening.

03:29:35
oskrm: Sounds like Adamdotdev

03:29:36
<transcript>: Okay.

03:29:40
<transcript>: It does not like me passing an image like this.

03:29:43
woycieszko: xD

03:29:46
<transcript>: Subnets Yuck.

03:29:50
<transcript>: Some times I forget.

03:29:50
<transcript>: just how

03:29:51
<transcript>: Just how.

03:29:51
<transcript>: much i

03:29:55
<transcript>: Much I have to think about when I'm dealing with containerization.

03:29:58
<transcript>: On AWS.

03:30:02
<transcript>: I'm not gonna say a load balancer name.

03:30:06
<transcript>: What is wrong with.

03:30:06
<transcript>: okay

03:30:08
<transcript>: Okay. So maybe image.

03:30:08
<transcript>: image

03:30:11
<transcript>: Image actually has to be.

03:30:14
<transcript>: A container image.

03:30:16
w3barsi: where is your mic positioned?

03:30:18
<transcript>: From asset.

03:30:21
<transcript>: That no.

03:30:27
<transcript>: Argument of type.

03:30:29
<transcript>: Services.

03:30:29
<transcript>: ever used

03:30:31
<transcript>: Ever used what.

03:30:33
<transcript>: Oh, that's fine.

03:30:33
<transcript>: oh

03:30:39
<transcript>: Oh, we haven't actually made it. A comp cluster equals new cluster.

03:30:44
<transcript>: This cluster.

03:30:44
<transcript>: will

03:30:46
<transcript>: Will get to all those props.

03:30:48
<transcript>: Bit.

03:30:52
<transcript>: Okay. So we have a cluster. We have CPU.

03:30:55
<transcript>: Yes, we'll go ahead and find this.

03:30:59
<transcript>: I don't know 1024.

03:31:09
<transcript>: Has to be very specific things. Maybe even we'll just go into 81, 92. I think it's gonna be a Biggie 81, nine, two.

03:31:13
<transcript>: We're probably more CPU, too, but my container image from asset.

03:31:13
<transcript>: so

03:31:17
<transcript>: So Docker image asset. Is that not an asset.

03:31:23
<transcript>: Asset.

03:31:32
<transcript>: Okay. What's wrong with this.

03:31:36
<transcript>: Argument of type.

03:31:42
<transcript>: Arguments at Docker images that's not sample to parameter type string.

03:31:43
<transcript>: But.

03:31:54
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:31:54
<transcript>: here we go

03:31:59
<transcript>: Here we go. Ecr Docker Image asset so new asset. They have the directory.

03:32:09
<transcript>: Asset Repository Grantpool. So we got to say that this past definition can actually pull that container image.

03:32:09
<transcript>: and then

03:32:13
<transcript>: And then here from ECR repository. Asset repository. Oh, interesting. Okay.

03:32:16
<transcript>: So it's from.

03:32:16
<transcript>: i thought

03:32:19
<transcript>: I thought I could just do from asset like that from ECSR.

03:32:23
<transcript>: Pository, and It's Asset Dot repository.

03:32:31
<transcript>: Okay. But then I also appear. Where was that? I have to say, asset.

03:32:31
<transcript>: grant

03:32:32
<transcript>: Grant.

03:32:37
<transcript>: No oh, repository.

03:32:37
<transcript>: repository

03:32:38
<transcript>: Repository.

03:32:41
<transcript>: Grant pull.

03:32:41
<transcript>: to

03:32:46
<transcript>: To our task definition. What is our task? That's a Fargate.

03:32:46
<transcript>: test definition

03:32:48
<transcript>: Test definition.

03:32:52
<transcript>: Interesting. So this is not using.

03:32:57
<transcript>: Okay, we're gonna do this down here.

03:33:00
<transcript>: It's gonna be granting it to.

03:33:04
<transcript>: Our service. Maybe.

03:33:04
<transcript>: such as work

03:33:06
<transcript>: Such as work now.

03:33:10
<transcript>: I Grantable service.

03:33:10
<transcript>: dot

03:33:11
<transcript>: Dot.

03:33:14
<transcript>: Task definition.

03:33:25
<transcript>: This is the basic. We're stepping out some basic stuff.

03:33:33
<transcript>: Let's see I don't like the coloring of my when I updated everything to the latest.

03:33:33
<transcript>: my coloring

03:33:37
<transcript>: My coloring. My Dracula coloring is all weird.

03:33:37
<transcript>: like

03:33:43
<transcript>: Like keywords are in that pink color. That's correct. But this should not be pink.

03:33:46
<transcript>: This should be a different color. I don't remember what color.

03:33:46
<transcript>: i just this

03:33:51
<transcript>: I just. This should be that color. I think the light blue. Where is my mic positioned.

03:33:54
<transcript>: It's right here.

03:33:54
<transcript>: you can't

03:33:58
<transcript>: You can't see it just out of frame. Like right there.

03:34:06
<transcript>: I was gonna look? Oh, yeah? The coloring. Oh, teaches. Here, teach.

03:34:11
<transcript>: Where would I even look? Let's go let's open up my.

03:34:11
w3barsi: maybe dracula has not updated to the new treesitter stuff

03:34:14
teej_dv: yeah, there was a recent update relating to tree-sitter stuff that colorschemes are catching up on I think

03:34:19
<transcript>: Let's go to my Dot files. Here.

03:34:22
<transcript>: Dracula.

03:34:22
<transcript>: there's somewhere where

03:34:26
<transcript>: There's somewhere where I'm defining here we go Dracula theme.

03:34:41
<transcript>: I know where I would look. Recent update relating to tree center stuff that color schemes are catching up on, I think. Okay, so it's just something like Dracula's out of date. Maybe Jackie is not updated to the new tree center stuff. Look at that. Barsy knows thiege nose.

03:34:41
<transcript>: you guys

03:34:47
teej_dv: that'd be my guess

03:34:48
<transcript>: You guys know maybe I'll try updating. Let's just start plugin. Let's just update everything and see.

03:34:51
<transcript>: Plug and file, Yeah.

03:34:54
<transcript>: Oh boy not a broke everything.

03:34:54
<transcript>: but i find out

03:34:56
<transcript>: But I find out.

03:34:58
<transcript>: Wait.

03:35:02
<transcript>: Updated Inventory Lou Aline.

03:35:06
<transcript>: What am I doing.

03:35:10
w3barsi: i was pulling my hair wondering why the colorscheme i created wasn't working

03:35:13
<transcript>: Plugin.

03:35:21
<transcript>: I didn't see if Drac goes up to because I hit the wrong keys so I don't know.

03:35:24
<transcript>: I guess I could go to the GitHub repo.

03:35:28
<transcript>: Dracula, vim.

03:35:37
<transcript>: What was the last update.

03:35:39
<transcript>: So our pull request for it.

03:35:42
<transcript>: Update Tree Sitter Highlight Groups Look at this.

03:35:42
<transcript>: oh

03:35:45
<transcript>: Oh more than one person.

03:35:50
<transcript>: Can I just use as you use this commit.

03:36:03
<transcript>: Deprecated.

03:36:07
<transcript>: Can. I can I just use this thing. Let's just use it.

03:36:10
<transcript>: What if I just do this.

03:36:15
<transcript>: Is this bad? Who thinks this is bad to just copy this commit.

03:36:19
<transcript>: Anyone. I'm just gonna do it.

03:36:22
<transcript>: This. I don't even know. I'm just gonna do it.

03:36:31
<transcript>: So I think the way I do that I used to do this. I used to have these pinned. And I don't remember now.

03:36:31
<transcript>: the syntax

03:36:32
<transcript>: The syntax.

03:36:32
<transcript>: there's like

03:36:34
<transcript>: There's like a.

03:36:34
<transcript>: way to just

03:36:37
<transcript>: Way to just like let's see.

03:36:42
<transcript>: Let's see if I can do the indent surround thing Ysa.

03:36:42
<transcript>: quote

03:36:46
teej_dv: i thought it was like "commit = ..." or something

03:36:48
<transcript>: Quote Bracket oh, feels good. I love when I do stuff like that. Like first try.

03:36:48
<transcript>: i don't know

03:36:53
<transcript>: I don't know what this is gonna be. Let's just call it plugin or do I have pipe Ed for this package.

03:36:59
<transcript>: I don't know what's that key is, but I think the next key is commit.

03:36:59
<transcript>: right

03:37:00
<transcript>: Right.

03:37:04
<transcript>: And that's where I can just.

03:37:08
<transcript>: Do like that.

03:37:12
<transcript>: What is that? Package key.

03:37:12
<transcript>: is question

03:37:14
<transcript>: Is question.

03:37:18
<transcript>: Name.

03:37:21
<transcript>: Somebody's gonna know.

03:37:21
<transcript>: yeah

03:37:23
<transcript>: Yeah as I commit equals.

03:37:23
<transcript>: use

03:37:26
uberrick: its just = not :

03:37:29
uberrick: I think anyway

03:37:33
<transcript>: Use. Did I have it anywhere in here? Commit. Oh, yeah, yeah. Here we go. Oh, so you don't even have to do a key for that first one. Okay. I clearly know nothing about Lua.

03:37:37
teej_dv: you are right uber

03:37:39
<transcript>: So this is going to be commit equals.

03:37:42
<transcript>: And I don't need any.

03:37:46
<transcript>: Like that, right.

03:37:50
<transcript>: Oh Failed to update update Dracula VM.

03:37:52
sbsabin911: hi

03:37:55
<transcript>: Try it again.

03:37:55
<transcript>: let's

03:38:01
<transcript>: Let's kind of smashing keys in the middle. Okay, filled update directly. Vim. So apparently that is not a commitment I can use.

03:38:07
<transcript>: Because it's just not on that branch or something. Is there? Like.

03:38:07
<transcript>: invim plugins

03:38:08
<transcript>: Invim plugins.

03:38:12
<transcript>: Commit branch kind of like do a certain branch.

03:38:19
<transcript>: Playing from specific branch.

03:38:22
<transcript>: Pinned.

03:38:26
<transcript>: What.

03:38:26
<transcript>: is this even

03:38:28
<transcript>: Is this even in Vim? I don't even know.

03:38:31
<transcript>: I'm using Packer, and then.

03:38:31
<transcript>: hacker

03:38:33
<transcript>: Hacker.

03:38:39
<transcript>: Who thinks this is possible.

03:38:40
<transcript>: Hi.

03:38:46
<transcript>: It's just equals, not quote. Yeah, yeah, we got that part, didn't we? How.

03:38:51
<transcript>: Best Sebastian Sebetha bin, welcome to my chat.

03:38:51
<transcript>: thank you

03:38:54
<transcript>: Thank you for chatting.

03:38:57
<transcript>: I want to use a branch.

03:38:57
<transcript>: i guess

03:38:59
<transcript>: I guess I could just try the intuitive thing.

03:38:59
<transcript>: the intuitive

03:39:01
<transcript>: The intuitive thing would be.

03:39:02
w3barsi: packer documentation says you're on the right track

03:39:07
<transcript>: Branch. Oh, sure enough.

03:39:07
teej_dv: it's just branch = "..."

03:39:13
<transcript>: Let's see such a impatient thing to do right.

03:39:13
<transcript>: it's kind of my

03:39:15
<transcript>: It's kind of my speed.

03:39:15
<transcript>: what

03:39:18
teej_dv: oh, maybe it's git branch, dunno

03:39:18
<transcript>: What is the branch? Oh, it's actually a different fork.

03:39:18
<transcript>: oh

03:39:20
<transcript>: Oh.

03:39:24
<transcript>: Git Branch. Yeah.

03:39:24
<transcript>: it's just

03:39:28
<transcript>: It's just branch get branch but can I use it? I guess I'm.

03:39:34
<transcript>: At this point, if I'm trying to use a different like a fork of it so kind of use that.

03:39:34
<transcript>: then

03:39:35
<transcript>: Then.

03:39:38
<transcript>: This is awesome.

03:39:43
sbsabin911: could you give your git hub link

03:39:45
<transcript>: I could just wait until it's merged in and just deal with it. But like, at this point, I'm committed, you know.

03:39:48
<transcript>: I probably only have their branch now because.

03:39:55
<transcript>: 13.

03:40:02
<transcript>: Then.

03:40:11
<transcript>: Is it just on? Oh, it's on fixed tree. Sitter. There we go.

03:40:15
<transcript>: Six.

03:40:15
<transcript>: three sitter

03:40:20
<transcript>: Three sitter. Is that what it was? Underscore? Six? No. Thick, tree sitter.

03:40:24
<transcript>: Work.

03:40:24
<transcript>: yes

03:40:26
<transcript>: Yes.

03:40:28
<transcript>: What? It what.

03:40:28
<transcript>: i want to remove

03:40:31
<transcript>: I want to remove that. That's bad.

03:40:34
<transcript>: Sight, Packer, start, vim.

03:40:37
<transcript>: No.

03:40:40
<transcript>: Why would I lose that.

03:40:40
<transcript>: build install

03:40:41
<transcript>: Build, install.

03:40:43
<transcript>: Thanks for follow.

03:40:44

03:40:58
<transcript>: can i do a

03:41:00
<transcript>: Can I do a different.

03:41:04
<transcript>: Fork of it.

03:41:05
cowfacedude99: hi @teej_dv

03:41:07
teej_dv: you want to delete

03:41:08
<transcript>: Fork.

03:41:09
teej_dv: o/ cowface

03:41:13
<transcript>: Remote.

03:41:18
<transcript>: Get.

03:41:23
<transcript>: Okay.

03:41:23
<transcript>: this might not

03:41:25
<transcript>: This might not this might not this might not work.

03:41:29
<transcript>: I know work might just be stuck.

03:41:29
<transcript>: why aren't we

03:41:33
<transcript>: Why aren't we? Why are we merging this? Dracula? Vim? What's going on.

03:41:33
<transcript>: let's just

03:41:35
<transcript>: Let's just merge the thing.

03:41:37
cowfacedude99: you can point it at the fork @adamdotdev

03:41:40
<transcript>: I seven days. It's approved.

03:41:43
w3barsi: say yes to delete

03:41:47
<transcript>: If it's approved, then what? Oh, this person still hasn't approved it. Maybe.

03:41:56
teej_dv: dont worry chat, he'll look after talking for awhile longer

03:41:57
<transcript>: Should just type. Yes. Oh, I do want to delete. Okay, let's just delete then. So you're saying I can I can do.

03:42:00
<transcript>: That.

03:42:02
<transcript>: And then delete.

03:42:08
<transcript>: This. The past. That it just threw me off. Start vim. It doesn't say Dracula in it.

03:42:12
<transcript>: Oh, it worked? Did it work.

03:42:17
cowfacedude99: I usually comment the original out and point it at the fix

03:42:20
<transcript>: Hey, I think it worked.

03:42:20
<transcript>: yeah

03:42:25
<transcript>: Yeah, yeah, it's in purple now. So auto command buff. Right post. So let's open up our.

03:42:29
<transcript>: For the little.

03:42:29
<transcript>: we just kind of did

03:42:37
<transcript>: We just kind of did a little tangent, but, you know, when Ted shows up. Yeah, it's in that light blue color. Perfect.

03:42:37
<transcript>: he shows up

03:42:40
<transcript>: He shows up, you're gonna do a little ins and stuff, you know.

03:42:40
<transcript>: it's just how it works

03:42:41
<transcript>: It's just how it works.

03:42:43
<transcript>: I don't make the rules.

03:42:50
cowfacedude99: @teej_dv LUL

03:42:53
<transcript>: You can point it at the fork.

03:42:58
<transcript>: Cool, we did it don't worry Chat. He'll look after talking for a while longer.

03:43:02
<transcript>: I just comment the original out and point it fix. That's a good idea.

03:43:05
theo: Wait what Iâ€™m actually catching you live??

03:43:07
<transcript>: I will totally forget later that that's just Draculating them. I would say soon.

03:43:11
<transcript>: This will be merged and I can just use.

03:43:12
teej_dv: sry, it's a recording theo

03:43:15
<transcript>: The thing. I don't know what the whole up is.

03:43:18
theo: 90 viewers?!?

03:43:19
<transcript>: Good.

03:43:19
<transcript>: is that knowing

03:43:22
uberrick: Yeah this is a re-run @Theo

03:43:24
<transcript>: Is that knowing is that annoying open source commit comment.

03:43:26
<transcript>: Does that just make you all mad.

03:43:28
theo: Real streamer hours clearly

03:43:30
<transcript>: Wait what? I'm actually catching you live.

03:43:33
<transcript>: Do Whoa, Theo, you're awake.

03:43:37
cowfacedude99: so many tickmarks!!!1

03:43:38
oskrm: theo this is a recorded broadcast

03:43:38
<transcript>: I'm just kidding, but really it's 847 over there because you have company, right.

03:43:42
<transcript>: You have people coming over. I am so I just tweeted the other.

03:43:42
teej_dv: yes, that's bad comment. i'd permaban you

03:43:48
<transcript>: I just tweeted that this is recorded. Broadcast. Yeah, I timed all this perfectly.

03:43:48
<transcript>: you probably

03:43:49
<transcript>: You probably.

03:43:49
theo: LUL yeah this is early for me

03:43:55
<transcript>: Getting FOMO Theo over the thought of all the people that are gonna be shown up at your house.

03:43:55
<transcript>: and

03:43:57
<transcript>: And hanging out.

03:44:06
<transcript>: I want to be one of those people, but also realize I've known all you for like, 10 seconds, and you're like, who's Adam? And next year, next year. S. Comp I'll be there.

03:44:09
<transcript>: Okay.

03:44:13
<transcript>: This is a rerun.

03:44:15
theo: Next year you better be here

03:44:15
uberrick: you mean t3 conf

03:44:18
<transcript>: Yeah, I would say this is early for you on the West Coast.

03:44:18
<transcript>: now

03:44:19
<transcript>: Now.

03:44:20
teej_dv: won't it just be "this.js conf" next year?

03:44:21
<transcript>: You can come in.

03:44:21
<transcript>: t three

03:44:23
<transcript>: T three comp. That's right. I'll be there for that.

03:44:23
<transcript>: so teach says

03:44:26
<transcript>: So Teach says he would permit me for this open source comment.

03:44:26
<transcript>: i feel kind of

03:44:28
<transcript>: I feel kind of bad now.

03:44:31
<transcript>: We'll see if AWS got back to us.

03:44:34
<transcript>: You would think you would think.

03:44:34
<transcript>: you get

03:44:38
<transcript>: You get eight of his hero status, you get kind of some perks.

03:44:38
<transcript>: that you could just be

03:44:40
<transcript>: That you could just be like, Hey.

03:44:42
<transcript>: Need to take a look. This support request.

03:44:45
<transcript>: Doesn't work that way. I tried.

03:44:45
<transcript>: i sent

03:44:47
<transcript>: I sent some DMs.

03:44:52
<transcript>: No dice still waiting on this case still can't stand up GPUs.

03:44:55
<transcript>: But I guess we've got a lot to do.

03:44:58
<transcript>: With XR. Dracula Color that's cool.

03:45:02
<transcript>: Okay. So.

03:45:04
<transcript>: Get ignore.

03:45:04
<transcript>: seeds get out

03:45:05
theo: Real talk this is my fav Vercel feature

03:45:06
<transcript>: Seeds get out. Why is it still showing.

03:45:11
<transcript>: It ignored.

03:45:14
theo: Itâ€™s only viable if popular on Twitter

03:45:21
<transcript>: Okay. So we've got our asset, which is gonna point to a Docker file. We're gonna just put our Docker file here in the route. Oh, it's already there.

03:45:22
theo: But I can get anything fixed pretty fast with a tweet

03:45:23
<transcript>: I thought I'd deleted this.

03:45:28
<transcript>: Okay. But actually.

03:45:28
<transcript>: this

03:45:32
cekirgehacker: probably you pushed that file accidently

03:45:33
<transcript>: This is relative. This directory here is relative to the root.

03:45:33
<transcript>: so that's

03:45:37
<transcript>: So that's actually fine. I wonder if it defaults to just the root.

03:45:37
<transcript>: indirect inside

03:45:37
uberrick: The power of an audience

03:45:38
<transcript>: Indirect inside of the name that.

03:45:43
<transcript>: Okay.

03:45:44
oskrm: @Theo yeah but that's bad customer relations

03:45:45
<transcript>: Believe that.

03:45:45
<transcript>: we do

03:45:50
<transcript>: We do want to include get CDK out node modules. That's fine. We don't have any build our.

03:45:55
<transcript>: Cluster.

03:45:55
<transcript>: at some

03:45:56
teej_dv: it's good customer relations for ppl that get answers LUL

03:46:00
<transcript>: At some point we have to figure out where we can figure that we need GPU class instances class.

03:46:04
<transcript>: Cluster Name Container insights.

03:46:06
<transcript>: Let's see here.

03:46:10
<transcript>: Where do we say, Oh.

03:46:12
<transcript>: Where do we say.

03:46:12
<transcript>: gpu

03:46:14
<transcript>: Gpu.

03:46:16
<transcript>: Or G, four.

03:46:16
<transcript>: or

03:46:17
<transcript>: Or.

03:46:17
<transcript>: three five

03:46:19
<transcript>: Three, Five, nothing.

03:46:22
<transcript>: Instance.

03:46:24
<transcript>: Unhelpful.

03:46:24
<transcript>: class

03:46:28
<transcript>: Class that's gonna be all over the place. What we need to do is.

03:46:32
<transcript>: Even do this. I don't even know Fargate pastafinition.

03:46:35
<transcript>: Ec, two.

03:46:38
<transcript>: Instance types.

03:46:38
<transcript>: we

03:46:43
<transcript>: We might not be able to Fargate which is gonna be a huge bummer if we have to actually. Here we go.

03:46:46
<transcript>: Easy to farget, no.

03:46:51
<transcript>: I should know the answer to this question.

03:46:54
<transcript>: Whether you can use.

03:46:54
<transcript>: far

03:47:01
<transcript>: Fargate and specific instance classes because we have to use G five. Right we have to use a GPU enabled.

03:47:11
<transcript>: Types. Okay. This removes the need to choose. Yeah. Okay. So that's the whole step with Fargate right.

03:47:13
<transcript>: The whole stick.

03:47:21
<transcript>: Is that you don't have to think about instance types so we can't use fargates. We have to use actual.

03:47:21
<transcript>: easy

03:47:23
<transcript>: Easy to clusters.

03:47:25
<transcript>: Bummer.

03:47:25
<transcript>: that's

03:47:31
<transcript>: That's a megabumr like I'm falling out of love with this solution.

03:47:31
<transcript>: real fast

03:47:32
<transcript>: Real fast.

03:47:40
<transcript>: Let's see if at least ECS patterns. Maybe they have an application load balance.

03:47:42
<transcript>: Non Fargate.

03:47:42
<transcript>: let's see

03:47:45
<transcript>: Let's see, let's go back.

03:47:50
<transcript>: Feel like I'm missing a Sidebar? There we go.

03:47:57
<transcript>: Ecs patterns. Here we have application load balance. Ec, two service.

03:47:57
<transcript>: multiple

03:47:59
<transcript>: Multiple target Groups, EC, Two service.

03:48:04
<transcript>: Schedule. Okay.

03:48:11
<transcript>: Yeah. I think we'll just be this. What a bummer. I don't want to do this if I have to manage.

03:48:16
<transcript>: The easy to I guess like I wouldn't want.

03:48:21
<transcript>: I would want some control over how many of these instances get spun up since they're so expensive.

03:48:41
<transcript>: This JS. Conf next year.

03:48:44
<transcript>: That's funny.

03:48:47
<transcript>: Favorite verse L feature.

03:48:47
<transcript>: it's only viable if

03:48:52
<transcript>: It's only viable if popular on Twitter. But I can get anything fixed pretty fast with the Tweet. It's awesome.

03:48:53
uberrick: Why are people scared of AWS _opens CDK docs_

03:48:59
teej_dv: well i'm glad someone laughed at it. thanks adam

03:49:01
<transcript>: Good customer releases for people to get answers.

03:49:06
<transcript>: I thought it was funny. Teach.

03:49:08
<transcript>: Oh, man.

03:49:08
<transcript>: i

03:49:09
<transcript>: I.

03:49:09
<transcript>: 've got a couple

03:49:15
<transcript>: 've got a couple of blockers here. We can't so we can't run. Let's just come over here and talk.

03:49:18
<transcript>: We can't run.

03:49:26
<transcript>: We can't run this dream booth stuff on our Mac. Well, we don't think so. I think. I mean, it might be possible, but the M one thing.

03:49:26
<transcript>: introduces

03:49:28
arkatufus: is this linux or windows?

03:49:29
<transcript>: Introduces lots of challenges. Right.

03:49:32
<transcript>: So then.

03:49:34
<transcript>: We've decided to move it to AWS.

03:49:34
<transcript>: where

03:49:37
<transcript>: Where we can just run.

03:49:37
arkatufus: oh, mac

03:49:43
cowfacedude99: bsd LUL

03:49:46
<transcript>: Ourca toothis. Yeah, I'm running on a Mac. So I've got a Mac studio, but we're gonna run this thing on AWS.

03:49:46
<transcript>: in

03:49:49
<transcript>: In Linux, Amazon, Linux, containers.

03:49:49
<transcript>: so

03:49:49
teej_dv: it's closedBSD

03:49:51
teej_dv: LUL

03:49:52
blakegreendev: https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/88 Please add a +1

03:49:52
<transcript>: So we're trying to make a dream booth thing.

03:49:52
<transcript>: that we

03:49:59
<transcript>: That we can drop like 20 images of a person training images and then spit out.

03:50:02
oskrm: google colab next Kappa

03:50:10
daglee: Go for a walk, it start to hell rain. Fml.

03:50:11
<transcript>: Stylized portraits of that person. Right. So there's been. If you haven't seen it on Twitter, people have been playing with this dream booth. It's a way to train your models. And then you can, like.

03:50:11
<transcript>: you can

03:50:15
<transcript>: You can do the inference side with stable diffusion.

03:50:15
<transcript>: and you like

03:50:16
<transcript>: And you like take a subject.

03:50:16
<transcript>: person

03:50:18
<transcript>: Person.

03:50:18
<transcript>: place things

03:50:25
<transcript>: Place things, whatever. And you can put them in all these different contexts. And it's amazing. Like it looks incredible. So I'm trying to do it.

03:50:26
arkatufus: I failed to install it on windows myself, wasted a whole weekend trying to

03:50:30
<transcript>: For Stat. Muse.

03:50:30
<transcript>: with

03:50:33
<transcript>: With athletes. Stat means we do a lot of like.

03:50:33
<transcript>: player

03:50:52
<transcript>: Player illustrations. We've had lived literally Michael Waltzock, an artist that has worked for Samus for, like, seven years. All day. He just draws images of professional athletes, like he is in Illustrator all day, every day. He does two or three a day cast for seven years. So now I got to pull this up.

03:50:52
<transcript>: so

03:50:57
<transcript>: So when you go to Stapmeus.com, or if you look at Twitter, let's just go to Twitter.

03:51:00
<transcript>: Stamp news.

03:51:00
<transcript>: on twitter

03:51:01
<transcript>: On Twitter.

03:51:06
<transcript>: So all of these player illustrations.

03:51:06
<transcript>: these

03:51:08
<transcript>: These professional athletes, you see.

03:51:08
<transcript>: these

03:51:14
<transcript>: These were all drawn by the same person, Michael Walchok. He's awesome. Following on Twitter.

03:51:17
<transcript>: He draws these all day. Every day.

03:51:17
<transcript>: and there's

03:51:29
<transcript>: And there's, like, 60 of them now or something. I mean, there's a ton of them, like so many players across the four major leagues. So we do a lot of, like, stammy's. It's kind of like it blends art and technology.

03:51:29
<transcript>: in kind of unique

03:51:31
<transcript>: In kind of unique ways.

03:51:34
<transcript>: And this is right up our alley. So stable, diffusion.

03:51:34
<transcript>: being able to

03:51:37
<transcript>: Being able to take images of athletes and create.

03:51:37
<transcript>: weird

03:51:41
<transcript>: Weird stuff with them. It's kind of like a thing we want to do.

03:51:44
<transcript>: So that's the motivation.

03:51:51
<transcript>: And we got to run it on GPU enabled instances. I'm waiting on this ticket.

03:51:51
<transcript>: i keep refreshing

03:51:54
<transcript>: I keep refreshing it keep not getting an answer.

03:51:54
<transcript>: i've

03:51:57
<transcript>: I've bugged people.

03:51:59
<transcript>: I've bugged people Where's my.

03:51:59
<transcript>: fuzzy

03:52:01
<transcript>: Fuzzy.

03:52:06
<transcript>: In slack seeing if I can get some attention.

03:52:09
<transcript>: No dice, no dice. So far.

03:52:09
<transcript>: so

03:52:13
<transcript>: So we're still waiting with the rest of the normies on this case to get results.

03:52:13
<transcript>: because

03:52:17
<transcript>: Because by default you can't run GPU instances. They're very expensive.

03:52:17
<transcript>: gpus

03:52:19
<transcript>: Gpus are not cheap.

03:52:28
<transcript>: So this account that I want to use it's like one of my main accounts as a ton of credits, and I'd rather use it than some of my other accounts.

03:52:28
<transcript>: but

03:52:34
<transcript>: But it doesn't have that limit increased. So then we played with this thing.

03:52:39
<transcript>: These images are cursed. This is LeBron James setting off throne.

03:52:39
<transcript>: doesn't look

03:52:43
uberrick: LUL

03:52:44
<transcript>: Doesn't look at all like LeBron James, so we have a pretty bad model here. This is like an out of the box.

03:52:44
<transcript>: web thing

03:52:47
<transcript>: Web thing you can just like drag training images on.

03:53:00
<transcript>: It's. It's like, I don't know how to get. I don't know how to do better. I think it's just my training images, but I'm not sure. And so I kind of want to like, I want to build the thing up from scratch to play with it, you know.

03:53:13
<transcript>: Please add a plus one to this issue. Blake, what is this issue? Blake copy link. Thank you for the follow. Dev's mule.

03:53:22
<transcript>: This is Containers roadmap issue. Tell us about your request. I mean, all plus one all day. I don't know what it is, but you got my plus one. Blake.

03:53:25
<transcript>: What do you want us to build.

03:53:30
<transcript>: Fargate ECS Telescope. Promise myself what how can we try to achieve ultimately when.

03:53:35
<transcript>: So, what is this issue? Fargo. Gpu support. Oh, Hey.

03:53:35
<transcript>: now that

03:53:37
teej_dv: not reading the title

03:53:38
teej_dv: OMEGALUL

03:53:40
<transcript>: Now that would be. That is exactly. I'm so glad I plus one did. This is exactly what I want.

03:53:43
<transcript>: Although I don't think they filled out the template.

03:53:46
uberrick: haha

03:53:50
oskrm: LUL Title screams whats about

03:53:51
<transcript>: Like this is just the template. There's no information in here. Is it just like in the title.

03:53:57
<transcript>: It's got a lot of plus ones for like not even filling out the template.

03:54:00
<transcript>: Give us more details about use case.

03:54:00
<transcript>: code version

03:54:01
<transcript>: Code version.

03:54:05
<transcript>: We would like to run object detection on Fargate.

03:54:05
<transcript>: so

03:54:14
<transcript>: So has this gotten any traction? Has that Amazon said that they're going to add this. Let's see, there's some hearts. I really want somebody make a browser.

03:54:14
<transcript>: ext

03:54:21
<transcript>: Extension please someone make one where I can sort by positive emojis on GitHub issues.

03:54:21
<transcript>: if someone

03:54:28
<transcript>: If someone makes that, I will pay you. I'll pay you money. I don't know how much I'll pay you money though. Thank you for the follow code spent.

03:54:33
captaincorkes: A topic for the next stream

03:54:34
codespent: I like money.

03:54:37
<transcript>: Installing windows wasted whole weekend trying to solve your song about stable diffusions.

03:54:37
<transcript>: not reading

03:54:43
<transcript>: Not reading the title. Sorry to you. I'm breaking so many open source rules. Teach hates me right now.

03:54:53
<transcript>: Title Screams What's about yeah, but like, there's a whole body here that they just it's so much text that I thought I should read it. And then I realized, this is all just the boilerplate.

03:54:53
<transcript>: like that's it

03:54:54
<transcript>: Like that's it.

03:55:06
<transcript>: Topic for the next stream. Code spent like money. Well, Coatsman, do you like building browser extensions.

03:55:10
<transcript>: I would love to have one where I can just like.

03:55:10
<transcript>: it's like

03:55:13
<transcript>: It's like show me the right answer just immediately.

03:55:18
codespent: I do and I have lunch coming up Kappa

03:55:26
<transcript>: You come to a GitHub issue. Inevitably, you scroll for five minutes, and you'll find the one where the guys, like, the girl is, like, here's how you do it and has, like, 1400 heart emojis. Like, that's the one I want.

03:55:31
<transcript>: I want to be able to, like, fill those, you know, the ones that got lots of attention.

03:55:33
uberrick: brings all the liked comments to the top so you can like without reading the title

03:55:35
arkatufus: failed to install dreambooth, it requires an AI language extension that can be build only on linux. I have stable diffusion working in a few hours

03:55:38
oskrm: Did you try it with google colab?

03:55:39
<transcript>: Plus one new GPS support for ECS Fargate. Who comes down that.

03:55:42
<transcript>: 's like this whole issue.

03:55:47
codespent: I'd be overly optomistic to say I'd build an extension on lunch as opposed to stuffing my face, though Kappa

03:55:48
<transcript>: Hey.

03:55:48
<transcript>: we

03:55:52
<transcript>: We are building a cloud engine Messer. We're working for the video rendering.

03:55:56
<transcript>: Quick update. We've been thinking about how to ship this.

03:55:56
<transcript>: actively design

03:56:02
<transcript>: Actively designing. I'll leave this. Hey, this is someone from AWS, hey, Seattle.

03:56:08
<transcript>: Actively designing I'll leave this in the current state until we have better.

03:56:08
<transcript>: line of

03:56:13
<transcript>: Line of sight internally, and then provide another update. Okay. Don't have a definite.

03:56:16
<transcript>: Definitive one. We'll release this. We're actually implementing.

03:56:16
<transcript>: decision we

03:56:20
<transcript>: Decision we have is what GPU type to support launch depending on.

03:56:23
<transcript>: G Five So we hope.

03:56:39
arkatufus: I think the Triton package failed to install on windows because it requires a specific C extension to compile, which isn't available in windows

03:56:40
<transcript>: This comes with reinvent. This is the time of year when we get lots of announcements. Thanks for the feedback on GPU types. As this customer I can't update on specific month or date except say that this is a top five capability enhancement for us and we're actively working on it. Alright.

03:56:43
<transcript>: This sounds great.

03:56:47
<transcript>: I love this. Like plus one.

03:56:47
<transcript>: five zero

03:56:49
<transcript>: 50.

03:56:58
<transcript>: Seven thumbs down. It's because you should do the plus, you should just click the emoji at the top, right? That's why people are thumbs down. Let's just thumbs down.

03:57:01
<transcript>: Teach. Does that upset you? That I just did that.

03:57:04
teej_dv: that' the equivalent of posting "this good"

03:57:05
<transcript>: Pile on, thumbs down.

03:57:05
<transcript>: so how you do it

03:57:07
<transcript>: So how you do it people.

03:57:19
<transcript>: Four days ago, adding GPUs forgot would make serverless finally applicable to data science workloads. I bet the analysis at Reinvent that was August. They're actively working on it.

03:57:19
<transcript>: my guess

03:57:24
<transcript>: My guess is their targeting reaction reinvent. We'll see.

03:57:25
<transcript>: We'll see.

03:57:33
<transcript>: Yeah. This good. Yeah. So by thumbs Downing it is that. Am I doing the right thing? Teach. I'm discourage.

03:57:35
<transcript>: discouraged

03:57:39
blakegreendev: Definitely a re:Invent announcement

03:57:40
<transcript>: Discouraged behavior. Thanks for the follow JB. Jb.

03:57:49
<transcript>: Did you try it with Google Collab? I didn't. Oscar, should we just fall back to that? I did see a lot of people say, just you use Google.

03:57:51
<transcript>: Maybe we should do that.

03:58:04
<transcript>: Brings all the liked comments to the top so that you can like without reading title. Yes, Rick, I don't want to read titles like I've got limited time. Just kidding.

03:58:04
<transcript>: failed install

03:58:06
oskrm: add a comment and say "waitin for this" Kappa

03:58:17
<transcript>: Failed install Dream Booth. It requires an AI language extension that can be built only on Linux. I've stabbed a Fusion working in a few hours. Yeah, I think stable diffusion. We could get working on my Mac. I don't know that we could get Dream Booth. That's what it sounds like is the struggle.

03:58:20
uberrick: or "+1"

03:58:25
<transcript>: Yeah, code spin. That sounds like a lot of pressure over a lunch break.

03:58:25
<transcript>: i do think

03:58:29
oskrm: @UberRick almost worst LUL

03:58:29
<transcript>: I do think some of these to build that maybe aren't smooth already has.

03:58:32
<transcript>: Google Chrome.

03:58:32
<transcript>: ext

03:58:33
<transcript>: Extension.

03:58:37
<transcript>: Sort GitHub.

03:58:38
<transcript>: Comments.

03:58:41
<transcript>: My reactions. There it is.

03:58:45
<transcript>: There it is.

03:58:45
<transcript>: one

03:58:48
<transcript>: One star, I mean one review.

03:58:51
<transcript>: Sort by reaction count.

03:58:56
<transcript>: Seals. Good. Let's try it. Why not? What could go wrong.

03:59:01
codespent: Someone built that since you mentioned LUL

03:59:01
<transcript>: Okay. So like, let's use that one as an example.

03:59:05
<transcript>: Refresh.

03:59:08
codespent: Man people ship fast.

03:59:11
<transcript>: Sort by reaction counts.

03:59:11
<transcript>: it

03:59:12
<transcript>: It works. No, it's.

03:59:15
<transcript>: No, it sure doesn't.

03:59:20
<transcript>: Right? Didn't didn't do it.

03:59:20
<transcript>: sort

03:59:24
<transcript>: Sort by reaction count. Oh, the already sorted now.

03:59:28
<transcript>: Seems brittle.

03:59:33
<transcript>: Okay, someone make it that works. Let me make one of those that works.

03:59:37
<transcript>: Okay.

03:59:38
uberrick: looks good it, ship it

03:59:39
<transcript>: Let's.

03:59:39
<transcript>: see

03:59:41
<transcript>: See.

03:59:42
uberrick: you owe them money

03:59:44
<transcript>: Any movement on my case.

03:59:46
blakegreendev: Sort by thumbs down? Lol

03:59:46
<transcript>: It'll be cool.

03:59:57
uberrick: looks good,*

03:59:57
<transcript>: That should since I mentioned it.

04:00:05
<transcript>: Yeah, I think this is gonna be a reinvent announcement. I think we're getting GPU support in Fargate.

04:00:07
<transcript>: Sort my thumbs down.

04:00:11
<transcript>: Alright.

04:00:14
<transcript>: Well.

04:00:14
<transcript>: i don't know

04:00:15
<transcript>: I don't know.

04:00:25
<transcript>: I guess we should keep going with the EC two version.

04:00:28
<transcript>: It just feels bad.

04:00:31
<transcript>: Feels like a thing. I don't want to exist.

04:00:31
<transcript>: i'm gonna

04:00:31
oskrm: go play with google colab for now

04:00:34
<transcript>: I'm gonna have to manage the cluster.

04:00:34
<transcript>: like

04:00:36
<transcript>: Like on my own.

04:00:43
<transcript>: So like instead of application load balance target service. This would be application.

04:00:43
<transcript>: load

04:00:47
<transcript>: Load balanced, easy to service.

04:00:49
<transcript>: You.

04:01:03
<transcript>: Just have to define.

04:01:06
<transcript>: Instance type where do I define.

04:01:09
<transcript>: Instance types.

04:01:13
<transcript>: Let's just look at this. This is EC Two service.

04:01:13
<transcript>: instance

04:01:14
<transcript>: Instance.

04:01:23
<transcript>: Types.

04:01:27
<transcript>: So I want to know.

04:01:30
<transcript>: Class.

04:01:35
<transcript>: Where do I define like, what type of instances it should be.

04:01:42
<transcript>: Task definition.

04:01:42
<transcript>: task image

04:01:44
<transcript>: Task Image options.

04:01:56
<transcript>: Container Name Container image.

04:01:56
<transcript>: now

04:02:00
<transcript>: Now none of this would be the is it on the cluster.

04:02:00
<transcript>: do we

04:02:03
<transcript>: Do we actually define it on the cluster? Maybe.

04:02:06
<transcript>: Blake, Greens. Here. Blake. Do you know.

04:02:06
<transcript>: where

04:02:08
<transcript>: Where do we define.

04:02:08
uberrick: might be worth a read

04:02:10
uberrick: https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1565731907664478209

04:02:11
<transcript>: What type of instances.

04:02:25
<transcript>: Somewhere we have to define.

04:02:28
uberrick: to run stable diffusion on m1

04:02:29
<transcript>: What instances make up the.

04:02:32
blakegreendev: Gotta be in the aws-ecs construct

04:02:40
<transcript>: Oh, to run stability fusion. Yeah, I think. I think, Rick, we were able to figure out how we would run stable diffusion. I don't know that we ever figured out if we'd be able to do dream booth.

04:02:40
<transcript>: dream

04:02:42
<transcript>: Dream boosts the problem.

04:02:47
<transcript>: Ai Images With Stabilizing on your MacBook M One in less than 30 seconds for free.

04:02:57
<transcript>: So Brew update Brew install Python Apple Silicon MPF support.

04:03:01
<transcript>: So then they.

04:03:04
<transcript>: Want this other clone.

04:03:04
<transcript>: this stable

04:03:08
<transcript>: This stable diffusion be first some kind of fork.

04:03:08
<transcript>: and

04:03:10
<transcript>: And then.

04:03:10
<transcript>: ld

04:03:18
<transcript>: Ldm stable versus version one. Pythons forced it to activate Bruinsemake, part of a thrust hip Installer requirements.

04:03:18
<transcript>: hu

04:03:20
<transcript>: Huggingface.com.

04:03:25
blakegreendev: You were looking in the patterns construct

04:03:25
<transcript>: Read and Understand License. Click Access Repository. Download that thing.

04:03:30
<transcript>: So that's where you get the model and then done type this.

04:03:33
<transcript>: Okay. So that's a nice.

04:03:39
<transcript>: Concise way to get it right on your Mac. Let's stabilize. You know again. I don't know.

04:03:44
<transcript>: I don't know that we could get dream booth.

04:03:46
<transcript>: Running.

04:03:46
<transcript>: let's

04:03:49
<transcript>: Let's do this. Let's.

04:03:55
<transcript>: Search levels.

04:03:55
<transcript>: let's search his

04:03:56
<transcript>: Let's search his.

04:03:56
<transcript>: let's see

04:03:58
<transcript>: Let's see.

04:04:00
<transcript>: His tweet history.

04:04:00
<transcript>: for

04:04:03
<transcript>: For so from.

04:04:06
<transcript>: Let's search dream booth.

04:04:11
<transcript>: He's on the same oh, dream of where you train the model steer it a bit.

04:04:11
<transcript>: ah

04:04:13
<transcript>: Aha.

04:04:15
<transcript>: Dream to training. What.

04:04:18
<transcript>: Is he done it on a Mac.

04:04:44
theruggedbear: 4h stream! damn Adam

04:04:45
<transcript>: You do it mainly by optimizing parameters, prepost image processing training. The A on specific data. Curious know the amount of effort in each of these categories. Yes. All parameters input text, dream Booth training. So is he doing Dream Booth on and Simone Mac? I would love to just do it locally. I would feel fantastic.

04:04:45
<transcript>: i

04:04:47
<transcript>: I just don't know if I can.

04:04:51
<transcript>: Did we see.

04:04:55
<transcript>: Stable Fusion Here's Dream Boost Table diffusion.

04:04:58
<transcript>: Mac OS let's just see, did anybody say.

04:05:02
<transcript>: Mac.

04:05:13
<transcript>: This is a fixed to get stable text image working on an M one Mac.

04:05:19
<transcript>: Did we read it's like CPU. Only. Maybe we read that.

04:05:24
<transcript>: Bummer.

04:05:38
<transcript>: Got to be in the AWS ECS construct. You were looking in the patterns. Construct. Oh, I see. Four hour stream, rugged bear. I used to do really long streams. This is like what I used to do. And I used to do it every day.

04:05:48
<transcript>: And then I had to start doing other things, too. Unfortunately, thank you for the follow. Memphis.

04:05:50
<transcript>: I don't live that far from Memphis.

04:05:55
<transcript>: Okay. So.

04:05:58
<transcript>: I guess we never did.

04:06:03
<transcript>: We're all out dream booth.

04:06:05
<transcript>: In one Mac.

04:06:07
theruggedbear: so it's on AWS, damn. i missed it. :(

04:06:24
uberrick: what did you try initially? W/ docker image locally?

04:06:37
<transcript>: Well.

04:06:44
<transcript>: Fusion B St.

04:07:01
<transcript>: Racks or server mounted render machines. We've been kind of all over the place on this dream.

04:07:05
<transcript>: What was this.

04:07:10
<transcript>: That's stable. Who's not in one. We don't have any like we know we can do that.

04:07:13
<transcript>: But we don't know is can we run.

04:07:15
<transcript>: Drink this.

04:07:21
<transcript>: I think I shouldn't get it running.

04:07:22
theruggedbear: you know stuff is going to happen when there are so many tabs in a browser Kappa

04:07:24
<transcript>: In.

04:07:24
<transcript>: a container running

04:07:27
<transcript>: A container running on AWS.

04:07:30
<transcript>: I think we'll have a little more luck.

04:07:30
<transcript>: with

04:07:32
<transcript>: With the Dream Booth side.

04:07:35
<transcript>: And then we can potentially like.

04:07:40
<transcript>: I don't know. You expose it publicly if we felt crazy.

04:07:51
<transcript>: Okay. So you were saying it would be in the ECS, not in the ECS patterns. It would be.

04:07:51
<transcript>: let's just say

04:07:52
<transcript>: Let's just say CDK.

04:08:03
<transcript>: And my hardware type.

04:08:16
<transcript>: This is an old issue.

04:08:16
<transcript>: here

04:08:18
<transcript>: Here. So here's the docs.

04:08:20
<transcript>: No.

04:08:23
theruggedbear: !keyboard

04:08:23
fossabot: Adam uses a custom Mode Eighty mechanical keyboard, and has a collection of other Mode keyboards!

04:08:35
<transcript>: Okay, I add capacity to our cluster, so we have to add, oh, it's the auto scaling groups.

04:08:45
<transcript>: Yeah. Here we go. Instant type. Okay. So this is it's the Autoscaling group.

04:08:45
<transcript>: launch

04:08:47
<transcript>: Launch configuration.

04:08:47
<transcript>: so like

04:08:49
<transcript>: So like we have a cluster here.

04:08:52
<transcript>: Can we scaling.

04:08:59
<transcript>: Here, Load balance.

04:09:03
<transcript>: Load balancer.

04:09:08
<transcript>: We're.

04:09:10
<transcript>: Target.

04:09:12
<transcript>: targeting

04:09:13
<transcript>: Targeting.

04:09:16
<transcript>: Load.

04:09:16
<transcript>: target

04:09:17
<transcript>: Target.

04:09:20
<transcript>: Auto scaling groups.

04:09:26
<transcript>: Ecs pattern.

04:09:26
<transcript>: patterns

04:09:28
<transcript>: Patterns, application.

04:09:30
<transcript>: Load.

04:09:33
<transcript>: Balance.

04:09:42
<transcript>: And I want to look at.

04:09:55
<transcript>: Schedule task based load balanced.

04:09:55
<transcript>: service

04:09:56
<transcript>: Service base.

04:09:59
<transcript>: Actually, I want to pull this up on. Let's see.

04:10:02
<transcript>: Github CDK.

04:10:05
<transcript>: Feel like this.

04:10:12
<transcript>: Do it like this.

04:10:12
<transcript>: hello

04:10:13
sarahconnor1959: coding so hard I got no patience

04:10:14
<transcript>: Hello vs code.

04:10:14
<transcript>: my old

04:10:14
blakegreendev: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_ecs.AddCapacityOptions.html

04:10:16
<transcript>: My old friend.

04:10:21
<transcript>: Sarah Connor coating so hard I got no patience. Welcome to my chat.

04:10:21
<transcript>: welcome

04:10:23
<transcript>: Welcome, welcome, welcome.

04:10:23
<transcript>: what did i try initially

04:10:27
<transcript>: What did I try initially with Docker image locally? No, I haven't even tried on.

04:10:27
<transcript>: docker locally

04:10:28
<transcript>: Docker locally.

04:10:35
<transcript>: I don't know if I could like, could I get a local.

04:10:35
<transcript>: container

04:10:46
<transcript>: Container running that is a Linux container that uses my Mac M one as a GPU. I don't think so. I think I need an Nvidia. I think I need physically an Nvidia GPU, right.

04:10:46
<transcript>: sync

04:10:47
<transcript>: Sync.

04:10:54
<transcript>: And capacity options. Thank you, Blake.

04:10:56
<transcript>: What is this.

04:10:59
<transcript>: Let's look at this.

04:11:06
<transcript>: Interface add capacity options. So cluster and then cluster add capacity. So here.

04:11:10
<transcript>: Cluster add capacity. Yes.

04:11:13
<transcript>: Add capacity.

04:11:13
<transcript>: it's gonna

04:11:17
<transcript>: It's gonna be default autoscaling group.

04:11:17
<transcript>: capacity

04:11:19
<transcript>: Capacity.

04:11:19
<transcript>: okay

04:11:21
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah. This feels good.

04:11:21
<transcript>: instance

04:11:24
<transcript>: Instance type. There we are.

04:11:30
<transcript>: New EC two let's just do instance type.

04:11:34
<transcript>: G, five.

04:11:34
<transcript>: oh doesn't i have

04:11:35
<transcript>: Oh, doesn't I have.

04:11:36
<transcript>: i guess

04:11:38
<transcript>: I guess it wouldn't ex large.

04:11:40
<transcript>: Something like that.

04:11:40
<transcript>: other

04:11:40
sarahconnor1959: damn verification key too long for secp256k1 :/ peepo sad

04:11:42
<transcript>: Other instance type.

04:11:45
<transcript>: And then desired capacity.

04:11:45
<transcript>: desired

04:11:48
<transcript>: Desired capacity.

04:11:48
blakegreendev: Boooya

04:11:52
<transcript>: Okay. So there we go. Our cluster now define.

04:11:52
<transcript>: that

04:11:56
<transcript>: That okay. I think this is kind of like, okay.

04:12:00
<transcript>: Not great because it's not Fargate. And that makes me sad.

04:12:00
<transcript>: but we're gonna

04:12:03
<transcript>: But we're gonna have, like coffee running.

04:12:09
<transcript>: Gpu instances. But when they add that to Fargate, hopefully soon.

04:12:09
<transcript>: hopefully

04:12:11
<transcript>: Hopefully soon.

04:12:11
<transcript>: verification

04:12:14
<transcript>: Verification key too long? For what.

04:12:14
<transcript>: people said

04:12:18
<transcript>: People said, What's that? Section six, K one.

04:12:23
<transcript>: What? Thank you so much, Blake. That was a huge help.

04:12:27
<transcript>: I was gonna go in here and actually look at the.

04:12:27
<transcript>: ecs pat

04:12:30
<transcript>: Ecs patterns. I just want to have this code up.

04:12:37
<transcript>: Like I wonder in our Load Balance service.

04:12:37
<transcript>: is there

04:12:40
sarahconnor1959: its a EC flavor

04:12:41
<transcript>: Is there any problem with like there's also.

04:12:49
<transcript>: Like when it stands up the load balancer, it creates a scaleing group. Right.

04:12:54
<transcript>: Target group application Target group.

04:13:01
<transcript>: What am I getting at? I'm concerned.

04:13:04
<transcript>: Can I not do this with the cluster.

04:13:09
<transcript>: Target group. I think these are different things. I think I'm thinking of something else.

04:13:09
<transcript>: i

04:13:16
<transcript>: I just don't work in this world very often. I don't work with EC Two, and ECS just kind of.

04:13:21
<transcript>: But this is a case where you kind of need to right.

04:13:25
<transcript>: So I think this should work if we define a cluster this way.

04:13:31
<transcript>: And if our instance type is correct, I guess that's the other question.

04:13:31
<transcript>: you see

04:13:32
blakegreendev: I think youâ€™re good

04:13:33
<transcript>: You see to.

04:13:33
<transcript>: g five

04:13:35
<transcript>: G Five instances.

04:13:37
<transcript>: Did I get the right.

04:13:41
<transcript>: Let's see.

04:13:43
<transcript>: What if the T for.

04:13:52
<transcript>: Keyboard G. I want GPU.

04:13:54
<transcript>: Compute optimize.

04:13:56
parkour_peter: Hello everyone!

04:14:00
<transcript>: Keyfot. Here we go. Accelerated computing. What's? G. 5g.

04:14:02
<transcript>: Graviton, two.

04:14:02
<transcript>: t

04:14:10
<transcript>: T 4G Tensor Core GPUs for the best price performance and is super graphics versus Android games streaming.

04:14:10
<transcript>: first arm

04:14:13
<transcript>: First Armbased instances in a major cloud to feature GPU acceleration.

04:14:19
<transcript>: For costeffective Ml inference. We're doing Ml training.

04:14:19
<transcript>: so

04:14:27
<transcript>: So these G five instances designed accelerate graphics and users. Machine learning inference also used to train simple to moderately complex machine learning models.

04:14:31
<transcript>: So up to eight Nvidia, a ten G Tensorcore GPUs.

04:14:46
<transcript>: Is this not what I want? Maybe I don't. Maybe I want what's? P. Four. The latest generation of GPU based instances provide the highest performance machine learning training. That's what we want. T. Four. Oh, no.

04:14:46
<transcript>: oh no

04:14:50
<transcript>: Oh, no, my ticket. Was it just G.

04:14:57
<transcript>: I think I just requested a limit increase for G.

04:15:01
<transcript>: All D instances. No.

04:15:03
<transcript>: I want to edit this.

04:15:05
<transcript>: Edit.

04:15:09
<transcript>: Actually, I'd like.

04:15:11
<transcript>: P class.

04:15:11
<transcript>: instances

04:15:12
<transcript>: Instances as well.

04:15:14
<transcript>: T for.

04:15:16
<transcript>: Pacific.

04:15:18
<transcript>: Okay.

04:15:25
<transcript>: Hope that hope that doesn't get lost in translation.

04:15:28
<transcript>: All PClass instances.

04:15:31
<transcript>: So that's probably not gonna happen today, but.

04:15:40
sergiomaster: hello!

04:15:44
<transcript>: It will happen. And maybe tomorrow we play with this some more. So these have the A 100, the A 100 Nvidia cards.

04:15:47
sergiomaster: what are you doing today?

04:15:47
<transcript>: These are the big boys.

04:15:49
<transcript>: So there's only.

04:15:58
<transcript>: You only have the option with P four of a 24 XL ooo.

04:15:59
<transcript>: oooh

04:16:00
<transcript>: Oooh.

04:16:04
<transcript>: That's gonna be expensive.

04:16:07
sarahconnor1959: can you code my project for me?

04:16:08
<transcript>: Like, let's just look that up. What's the cost per.

04:16:13
<transcript>: Let's see.

04:16:22
<transcript>: Can I go to project for you, Sir Connor, I don't really do a lot of coding projects for people.

04:16:22
<transcript>: in this stage

04:16:23
<transcript>: In this stage.

04:16:25
<transcript>: Of my life.

04:16:25
<transcript>: what do you want

04:16:31
<transcript>: What do you want to build? I'm sure somebody would build it for you. Or with you. What am I looking for? Pricing, pricing.

04:16:34
blakegreendev: How many AWS credits do you have haha

04:16:35
<transcript>: People.

04:16:38
<transcript>: On demand.

04:16:45
<transcript>: US east one that's fine. Yes. These two Linux instance type.

04:16:47
<transcript>: Accelerated computing.

04:16:56
<transcript>: We only want well, I'll just. I'll just find it here. P XL $32 an hour.

04:17:02
<transcript>: I have some credits. I don't know if I have that many credits.

04:17:02
<transcript>: hello

04:17:04
sarahconnor1959: small crypto project xd

04:17:05
<transcript>: Hello, welcome to Chat. Sergio. Master.

04:17:11
<transcript>: Hello, Parkour. It's been a while. Peter. How you? How you doing? How are you.

04:17:11
<transcript>: how you

04:17:13
<transcript>: How you.

04:17:21
<transcript>: Got maybe like maybe like 10,000 credits. Something like that.

04:17:21
<transcript>: so like this

04:17:24
<transcript>: So like this would last a bit. Thanks for the follow. Dsn.

04:17:27
<transcript>: It would last some hours.

04:17:29
sinamobasheri: hey be careful about THE ðŸ“¦ BOX

04:17:30
sergiomaster: I see that you're using ec2 and creating a cluster right?

04:17:34
<transcript>: But not a lot of hours. I think P Three is probably our best blend of performance.

04:17:36
<transcript>: And cost.

04:17:39
<transcript>: So let's look at the.

04:17:42
<transcript>: P, Three, s.

04:17:47
<transcript>: Wow, is that really like the only thing available.

04:17:47
<transcript>: latest gener

04:17:48
<transcript>: Latest generation.

04:17:56
<transcript>: P, three high performs compute in the cloud with up to eight V ten or V 100 TensorFlow GPUs.

04:17:58
aliand1337: MacBook 14 inch vs 16 inch, which one to buy? 16 inch is more expensive though.

04:18:07
<transcript>: So here we can do like a P, Three XL, eight XL, 16 XL, or a 24 XL, which has the NVMe drives.

04:18:11
blakegreendev: Haha order a snowmobile with those credits

04:18:11
<transcript>: Oh, interesting. These are EBS only.

04:18:14
<transcript>: Okay.

04:18:15
cekirgehacker: @aliand1337 14" is more compact

04:18:21
parkour_peter: Why u need 8x V100?

04:18:22
<transcript>: I'm sure those are super expensive as well.

04:18:25
<transcript>: What's the T, Three, DN.

04:18:26
uberrick: @SergioMaster yeah using ECS which will create the EC2 instances

04:18:28
<transcript>: P, three.

04:18:35
<transcript>: P, Three, B.

04:18:37
<transcript>: That doesn't even list it.

04:18:41
<transcript>: E three.

04:18:44
<transcript>: They shall follow.

04:18:44
<transcript>: hard

04:18:45
<transcript>: Hard.

04:18:45
<transcript>: a

04:18:46
<transcript>: A.

04:18:48
<transcript>: aaa

04:18:51
<transcript>: Aaa why you need eight times Z 100 probably don't.

04:18:53
aliand1337: @aliand1337 isn't 14 inch too small for coding

04:18:53
<transcript>: Probably don't.

04:18:55
<transcript>: That's.

04:18:58
<transcript>: Using easy to.

04:19:05
<transcript>: And creating a cluster? Yes. Or do I think that's the plan, the plan is.

04:19:07
<transcript>: To use.

04:19:07
<transcript>: ecs

04:19:09
<transcript>: Ecs.

04:19:09
<transcript>: which use

04:19:11
<transcript>: Which uses a cluster.

04:19:14
<transcript>: For deploying our services onto that.

04:19:14
<transcript>: these

04:19:20
sergiomaster: what you'll deploy on docker?

04:19:20
<transcript>: These instances. These easy two instances. So we just have to pick a class that we wanted to create these instances with.

04:19:29
<transcript>: What is that math? Like if you're using a 30, let's say we like use the P four because we're not.

04:19:29
<transcript>: let's say

04:19:34
<transcript>: Let's say we were just stupid, and we use one of these guys.

04:19:37
<transcript>: Does that even have the NVMe? Yeah.

04:19:40
<transcript>: So let's say we did.

04:19:43
<transcript>: At $32 an hour.

04:19:52
<transcript>: 32 times 24. That is $768 a day.

04:19:52
<transcript>: money a lot

04:19:55
<transcript>: Money a lot more subscriptions, folks.

04:19:59
<transcript>: So times 30.

04:19:59
<transcript>: what did i just type

04:20:02
<transcript>: What did I just type times 30.

04:20:06
<transcript>: That's like, oh, I didn't mean to do plus Mr. Equals.

04:20:09
<transcript>: I'm sorry. What.

04:20:09
<transcript>: seven

04:20:14
<transcript>: 768 times 37 six, eight.

04:20:17
<transcript>: Times 30.

04:20:21
<transcript>: Is $23,000 a month.

04:20:21
<transcript>: that is

04:20:25
<transcript>: That is a lot a lot a lot of dollars.

04:20:28
<transcript>: Yeah. So those are expensive.

04:20:28
<transcript>: not going to use

04:20:29
cekirgehacker: @aliand1337 actually not. It's about the resolution not screen size. and workspaces will help you a lot

04:20:36
<transcript>: Not going to use those. I mean, even like a small one of these P, three S, $3 an hour. That's like three times.

04:20:38
codespent: Easy.

04:20:39
<transcript>: 24 hours times, 30 days in a month.

04:20:39
<transcript>: that's

04:20:46
nate_codes: YOOOOOO ADAM!!! HAPPY MONDAY MY DUDE!

04:20:48
<transcript>: That's $2,000 a month for just that little guy. Just a little guy. Thanks so much. Flip edits for the subscription. I appreciate that so much.

04:20:48
<transcript>: flip edit

04:20:50
<transcript>: Flip edit.

04:20:50
aliand1337: do you own 14?

04:20:53
<transcript>: Wait a minute.

04:20:55
<transcript>: Flip.

04:20:55
<transcript>: nate code

04:20:58
<transcript>: Nate Codes. Thank you so much.

04:20:58
<transcript>: thank you

04:21:00
nate_codes: PogChamp @flipedits is here?

04:21:00
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the two months.

04:21:01
nate_codes: wait he's not

04:21:03
<transcript>: Flip edits.

04:21:03
<transcript>: that name

04:21:04

aliand1337: moving between workspaces vs side by side on screen?

04:21:07
<transcript>: Not flip Media, right.

04:21:07
<transcript>: flip is

04:21:09
<transcript>: Flip is that you.

04:21:12
nate_codes: That is prime's editor

04:21:12
theruggedbear: ye, you know Flip

04:21:15
<transcript>: Head of Media at the startup it is. Thank you so much. Flip.

04:21:15
<transcript>: i appreciate

04:21:15
nate_codes: yes it is

04:21:17
<transcript>: I appreciate that.

04:21:17
<transcript>: so much

04:21:18
<transcript>: So much.

04:21:18
<transcript>: fl

04:21:18
flipedits: yes sir!

04:21:22
cekirgehacker: @aliand1337 I have 13" macbook and that enough

04:21:24
<transcript>: Flip is the Flip Edits, Tie and Primes videos.

04:21:24
nate_codes: the GOAT himself

04:21:27
<transcript>: Welcome to my Chat flip.

04:21:32
<transcript>: 13 inch MacBook. And that enough goat himself. It is the goat.

04:21:34
aliand1337: @aliand1337 m1?

04:21:37
<transcript>: Flip, flip, flip. How you doing? Flip.

04:21:37
<transcript>: i don't think

04:21:37
cekirgehacker: @aliand1337 depends on you

04:21:41
<transcript>: I don't think we've really interact outside of Twitter, Twitter, Twitter, DMs.

04:21:48
<transcript>: Flip. You're not going to San Francisco, are you.

04:21:48
<transcript>: are you

04:21:48
cekirgehacker: @aliand1337 yeah m1

04:21:54
<transcript>: Are you adding to my FOMO? Are you gonna be there with all the people at next JS. Comp.

04:21:57
<transcript>: Got so much FOMO Nate or you going to San Francisco.

04:22:01
flipedits: @nate_codes <3

04:22:03
<transcript>: Let's see.

04:22:05
nate_codes: No sir

04:22:10
<transcript>: So what is the instance type we want to use? I don't even know anymore.

04:22:11
flipedits: Nah not this time

04:22:13
<transcript>: I don't know.

04:22:13
<transcript>: not a p four

04:22:14
<transcript>: Not a P four.

04:22:18
<transcript>: So what are the P twos, P, twos.

04:22:20
nate_codes: Can't afford a second spontaneous road trip with no ticket just hoping to get in

04:22:23
<transcript>: I don't even see K 80 GPUs. Sounds bad.

04:22:33
nate_codes: wife's 8mo pregnant and Twitch Con was tough to pull off lol

04:22:38
<transcript>: Okay, so training one. I have a training one instance Parfide AWS Trainium chips purpose built for highperformance deep learning training while offering up to 50% cost train savings over comparably B instances and that sounds awesome if it works. I mean, if that works with are they Nvidia.

04:22:42
<transcript>: Third generation until Xeon that's the processor.

04:22:42
<transcript>: what kind of

04:22:45
<transcript>: What kind of like would this work with Kuda.

04:22:47
<transcript>: I would assume so.

04:22:52
<transcript>: Like I would assume you could run these instances with the same base images.

04:22:56
<transcript>: The Amazon Linux Base images that already have like.

04:23:14
<transcript>: Pi Torch and Stuff installed deployed an EC two Ultra clusters that when they were scaling up to 300 image training accelerators connected with Petabytescale nonblocking networking and Scalable low latency storage with Amazon FXX for luster I love when I read a sentence like this, I just love when people are like.

04:23:14
<transcript>: i'm gonna do stuff on

04:23:16
<transcript>: I'm gonna do stuff on prim.

04:23:16
<transcript>: like

04:23:18
<transcript>: Like I get it.

04:23:18
<transcript>: some of these clouds

04:23:20
<transcript>: Some of these clouds.

04:23:27
<transcript>: Architectures you can build are expensive, but like you can't do this stuff like you're it Department can't.

04:23:27
<transcript>: like can't

04:23:28
<transcript>: Like can't.

04:23:28
<transcript>: just can't do it

04:23:30
<transcript>: Just can't do it.

04:23:34
<transcript>: Maybe you don't need to do it, but you definitely can't do it.

04:23:40
<transcript>: How much are these training ones to Excel has one Trainum. Accelerator.

04:23:45
<transcript>: I can't wait till I have access to GPU instances so I can try this stuff.

04:23:45
<transcript>: let's go

04:23:48
<transcript>: Let's go to train.

04:23:51
<transcript>: Trn.

04:23:51
<transcript>: oh

04:23:52
<transcript>: Oh, backwards.

04:23:55
<transcript>: Tr? N.

04:23:55
<transcript>: oh

04:23:59
<transcript>: Oh, then I have pricing. Is it not accelerated computing.

04:23:59
<transcript>: should

04:24:01
<transcript>: Should be.

04:24:10
<transcript>: Sorted by name.

04:24:10
<transcript>: well

04:24:14
<transcript>: Well, T is after P. So this not listed here.

04:24:14
<transcript>: why

04:24:15
<transcript>: Why.

04:24:19
<transcript>: Let's just Google it.

04:24:26
<transcript>: Google Train One, Two XL pricing.

04:24:36
<transcript>: Picture Cost savings.

04:24:41
<transcript>: But not published.

04:24:47
<transcript>: Thanks for following mankow.

04:24:56
<transcript>: And no, sir. No, not the time. Okay? You all can be. You can experience the FOMO with me. Then it's gonna really hurt.

04:24:56
<transcript>: it's gonna really

04:25:02
<transcript>: It's gonna really hurt when I see the videos of like prime hanging out and Beo's house.

04:25:02
<transcript>: i can't wait

04:25:10
<transcript>: I can't wait to see it, but it's also just gonna be like, the most FOMO I think I've ever had in my career. Just like all my favorite people hanging out in person.

04:25:18
<transcript>: Can't afford a second spontaneous road trip. Yeah, I'm just hoping to get in. Yeah. Nate, you did that with TouchCon, right? Eight months pregnant.

04:25:22
<transcript>: Congratulations.

04:25:27
<transcript>: That's a lot of months to be pregnant. Thanks for the follow Imagine room.

04:25:34
<transcript>: Yeah. Travel when your wife is pregnant. That's that's tough to pull off.

04:25:38
<transcript>: What's this person say? Training.

04:25:49
<transcript>: P for me 24 XL highest performing multigpu instance on AWS. Yeah, we figured that out. We need all the performance you can get. Use it for distributed training on large models and data sets.

04:26:03
<transcript>: Highest performing single GPU instance on AWS is a P three to X large. When you want the highest form single GPU, you're fine with 16GB. We're actually not fine with that. I don't think 16 G is that enough.

04:26:03
<transcript>: gp

04:26:06
<transcript>: Gpu memory? Did we say that was enough? Vram.

04:26:08
<transcript>: Maybe it is.

04:26:12
<transcript>: A G Five is the best performance to cost.

04:26:14
<transcript>: costing

04:26:15
<transcript>: Costing.

04:26:28
<transcript>: They don't even talk. They're never gonna talk about the training instance. Type. Oh, here we go. These two do train one instances up to 16. A toranium chips.

04:26:28
<transcript>: as an alternative

04:26:34
<transcript>: As an alternative to P three DN. P. Vl. One instances for training, but how much do they cost.

04:26:40
<transcript>: How much do they cost.

04:26:54
<transcript>: They're not listed here.

04:26:59
<transcript>: Which is interesting. Maybe let's do all and then search TRM.

04:27:06
<transcript>: Is it like one of those so expensive, like you got a call to find out.

04:27:12
<transcript>: Let's see if this tells us anything else.

04:27:14
thecision: https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/trn1/#Product_details

04:27:15
<transcript>: Pricing.

04:27:17
thecision: Isn't price here?

04:27:26
<transcript>: Oh, here we go on demand price per hour. Here we go. So the train one, two Xlarge is a dollar 34 hours on demand.

04:27:32
<transcript>: I mean, reserve pricing is so much better. That's the thing you could actually build something.

04:27:32
<transcript>: you could you could

04:27:34
<transcript>: You could you could build something.

04:27:41
<transcript>: Much more economically feasible if you could lock yourself in to a year or three years.

04:27:46
<transcript>: Yeah, we just found it. Decision. I think you found it before I did. I just did look at chat.

04:27:50
<transcript>: So okay.

04:27:50
<transcript>: now i

04:27:53
<transcript>: Now I feel like I need to say, I want.

04:27:53
<transcript>: access

04:28:02
<transcript>: Access to the train one as well. I'm just gonna say, can I just get all the GPU enabled instances on this one ticket? Can you just give me access to all of them.

04:28:04
blakegreendev: Why not use the AWS calculator? https://calculator.aws/#/

04:28:04
<transcript>: I'm gonna do that.

04:28:06
<transcript>: Gonna request it.

04:28:10
<transcript>: Actually.

04:28:12
<transcript>: And I get.

04:28:12
<transcript>: access

04:28:14
<transcript>: Access.

04:28:15
<transcript>: To.

04:28:19
<transcript>: All accelerated.

04:28:22
<transcript>: Instance types.

04:28:25
<transcript>: Train one.

04:28:28
<transcript>: Key for P three.

04:28:28
<transcript>: g five

04:28:29
<transcript>: G, five.

04:28:29
blakegreendev: Math is hard

04:28:31
<transcript>: Etc.

04:28:35
<transcript>: Let me know.

04:28:35
<transcript>: if i

04:28:37
<transcript>: If I need separate.

04:28:39
aliand1337: @aliand1337 does docker work?

04:28:42
<transcript>: Okay.

04:28:48
<transcript>: Cool. Hopefully tomorrow.

04:28:48
<transcript>: i've

04:28:52
<transcript>: I've got an answer on this case, and I can actually spin these up.

04:28:55
<transcript>: upload your

04:28:55
<transcript>: upload your favorite deep

04:28:58
<transcript>: Upload your favorite deep learning framework is easier. I just Pip and saw.

04:28:58
<transcript>: not really

04:29:07
<transcript>: Not really framework should install from upstream repositories. I'm not sure if it's hard hardware to run on these frameworks or built for a wide range drawer CPUs support Lowender features.

04:29:07
<transcript>: highly recommend

04:29:13
<transcript>: Highly recommend AWS, Deep Learning Mis, which we are very familiar with.

04:29:13
cowfacedude99: can I guide the raid?

04:29:23
<transcript>: It'll be as qualified as in system on all Ecgpu instances include a Tobs optimizations okay which GPUs consider for HPC use cases.

04:29:36
<transcript>: Do you prefer consuming content at graphical form.

04:29:39
<transcript>: Okay.

04:29:39
<transcript>: well

04:29:40
<transcript>: Well.

04:29:44
<transcript>: We're gonna play with this. We're gonna get this thing running.

04:29:52
<transcript>: On a GPU instance, can you guide the race? How'd you know Cafes? How did you know that? We're getting ready to raid.

04:29:56
<transcript>: How did you know that I was done at four and a half hours.

04:29:56
<transcript>: how

04:29:58
<transcript>: How did you know that.

04:29:58
<transcript>: does docker work

04:29:59
<transcript>: Does Docker work.

04:30:05
<transcript>: Why not use a to this calculator? I find the calculator difficult.

04:30:08
<transcript>: Oh, maybe I'm not thinking of that one, though.

04:30:11
<transcript>: Let me see if that's the one I'm thinking of. Calculator.

04:30:24
cowfacedude99: thealtf4 stream is streaming and he's doing nix ( I think)

04:30:27
<transcript>: I know. I I've definitely used it in the past, mostly. Blake. I've just built stuff these days, the serverless. And I don't think about cost because it's like if it costs a lot, there's a good reason and.

04:30:27
<transcript>: it's good problem

04:30:29
<transcript>: It's good problem.

04:30:29
<transcript>: but i guess

04:30:32
<transcript>: But I guess doing this kind of stuff, you have to actually think about it. Daniel.

04:30:36
<transcript>: The Altifore stream streaming. He's doing. Nyx, cool.

04:30:36
<transcript>: we will go

04:30:45
<transcript>: We will go watch Alta Four. I don't know if I've ever gotten a catch. An Alt F Four stream live. My hours don't seem to line up with their hours.

04:30:45
<transcript>: but we will do

04:30:49
<transcript>: But we will do that. I think I am done for the day. It's been a ton of fun.

04:30:52
<transcript>: We didn't accomplish much.

04:30:52
<transcript>: we kind of learned

04:30:58
<transcript>: We kind of learned a lot. I feel like I feel like we learned a lot. Did you learn anything I learned.

04:30:58
<transcript>: that

04:30:59
<transcript>: That.

04:31:13
<transcript>: Well, I've kind of settled loans. Directions, right. We're going to we're gonna install all the stable diffusion stuff with Dream Booth in an ECS container where we can spin them up, spin up these containers.

04:31:18
<transcript>: And do training jobs. Kind of spontaneously. Maybe not.

04:31:18
<transcript>: it's not

04:31:24
<transcript>: It's not as serverless as I'd like it to be, because Bargain doesn't support GPU instances yet.

04:31:24
<transcript>: hopefully

04:31:26
<transcript>: Hopefully we can swap that out for Fargate.

04:31:26
<transcript>: sometime

04:31:33
cowfacedude99: I think for next 5 ish min you will have opening music.

04:31:44
<transcript>: Sometime later this year. Seems like they're working on it, so yeah, it's been a lot fun learning some stuff about stable diffusion, AI, etc. Stick around and you can raid the Altframe doing some Nick stuff. Five Inch minus. You'll have opening music. Oh, if we rate them right now, we're just going to be catching nothing.

04:31:47
<transcript>: And we talked for five more minutes.

04:31:47
<transcript>: we can take the problem

04:31:49
<transcript>: We can take the problem. Probably do it.

04:31:49
<transcript>: let's see

04:31:53
<transcript>: Let's see. There are there are things to talk about. I'm going to make a video this week.

04:31:58
<transcript>: It's going to be a recap of next JS. Conf.

04:32:03
<transcript>: So like next Jess Conf Star tomorrow? Or is tomorrow? I think it's all tomorrow.

04:32:03
<transcript>: and

04:32:09
<transcript>: And there's like a bunch of sessions, like a ton of people that I really like are doing.

04:32:09
<transcript>: talks

04:32:11
<transcript>: Talks CEO. Who's here.

04:32:11
<transcript>: see you doing a talk

04:32:14
<transcript>: See you doing a talk trash. Dev is doing a talk.

04:32:19
codespent: Halloween's coming up, tell us a scary story to fill the void Kappa

04:32:24
<transcript>: There's just a lot of people mutual doing it a talk. There's a bunch of streamers. So they're all gonna be doing these talks. That Nick shit is confident. Obviously. There's, like the.

04:32:32
<transcript>: There's the keynote where they'll talk about Next J and all the new shiny stuff, right? I'm going to do.

04:32:32
<transcript>: a

04:32:37
<transcript>: A My next YouTube video this week. I'll publish it hopefully Friday or something.

04:32:37
<transcript>: i'm just gonna recap

04:32:47
<transcript>: I'm just gonna recap the whole thing like I've got all kinds of excess thoughts right now. It turns out and it's the timing is perfect because I'm really curious kind of where things are headed.

04:32:47
<transcript>: with next

04:32:49
<transcript>: With next JS.

04:32:49
<transcript>: but i'm

04:33:04
<transcript>: But I'm gonna go through every single session, like, I'm gonna recap the keynote, and I'm gonna recap every single session, like, TLDR. So if you don't want to watch all of next, JFK, you just watch my video, and I'm gonna talk about all of it.

04:33:04
<transcript>: i'm already

04:33:24
<transcript>: I'm already like, I'm aware of what several of the people are speaking about. I'm already kind of, like, queuing up my thoughts. Yeah. I guess I'm in this weird place with Next shift. So I'm very excited about the timing of this. Like, I have used Nick JS for three or four years, like, as a default, just like when I started a new project, I'm probably gonna build the front end with Next JS, but.

04:33:24
<transcript>: i use

04:33:30
blakegreendev: The docs are great but not public yet

04:33:31
<transcript>: I use next. Js from this perspective of like, I'm more of a backend engineer. I would say I'm more of like an infrastructure.

04:33:34
<transcript>: Aws nerd.

04:33:37
<transcript>: Docs are great, not public. Yet they're great.

04:33:37
<transcript>: those next

04:33:39
<transcript>: Those next 13 docs.

04:33:39
<transcript>: they're great

04:33:45
<transcript>: They're great can't see them yet because they're not public. But I'll tell you they're great.

04:33:48
<transcript>: Blake saw my my seizure this morning.

04:33:55
<transcript>: That was like a subtweet in video form of like all the people who've gotten access to the docs and they have to talk about on Twitter.

04:33:55
<transcript>: and they always

04:33:58
<transcript>: And they always have like the parentheses, like they're not public yet.

04:33:58
<transcript>: so

04:34:02
<transcript>: So you can't see them. But, man, let me tell you they're fantastic.

04:34:08
<transcript>: It's funny. I've heard, like such mixed reviews. I've heard a couple people say they're terrible. And I've heard.

04:34:08
<transcript>: other people

04:34:13
<transcript>: Other people that just publicly want to say that they've looked at them or like they're the best stocks I've ever seen.

04:34:13
<transcript>: that's just

04:34:20
<transcript>: That's just kind of how things go. You get access to something you want to tell people. I'm the same way somebody lets me in on something early. Half let people know.

04:34:26
<transcript>: So I don't I don't fault them. But like my thing with next Jess, I guess, like.

04:34:26
<transcript>: i

04:34:32
<transcript>: I come at it from the perspective of it, abstracts away from stuff that I don't want to think about, right.

04:34:32
<transcript>: i

04:34:36
<transcript>: I want to build my API or whatever and something else.

04:34:39
<transcript>: Probably serverless stuff on AWS.

04:34:39
<transcript>: appsync

04:34:59
<transcript>: Appsync, API Gateway, something. I'm gonna build my API and all my data access and all that stuff. It's gonna be stuff I build by hand and have fun with. And then I just need a front end. So I use nxjs. It helps me not think about webpack and bundling and transpiling and my Dev environment with hot reloads. It helps me just like, not think about all that stuff. But I realized.

04:35:20
<transcript>: In, like Theo's, talk for Next. Yes. It's like Nick SHS. It's a back end framework, and that just cracks me up. But I guess I get the point. I get what he's saying. Like Next yes is just it's just react on the front end. It doesn't introduce stuff in the frontend. Really. Aside from, like the image component and maybe some other things. I don't know. But.

04:35:20
<transcript>: mostly it

04:35:22
<transcript>: Mostly it's just react right.

04:35:22
<transcript>: the thing

04:35:24
<transcript>: The thing that next is.

04:35:24
<transcript>: where

04:35:28
<transcript>: Where next actually exists in the runtime element is the back end.

04:35:28
<transcript>: you can

04:35:31
<transcript>: You can do serverside rendering whatever right.

04:35:31
<transcript>: so

04:35:38
<transcript>: So in that sense it is. I guess it's a back end framework, but it's like the most back end framework for frontendes.

04:35:38
<transcript>: thing ever

04:35:41
<transcript>: Thing ever like frontend Dev surely think.

04:35:41
<transcript>: that's a back

04:35:45
<transcript>: That's a back end framework. But if you're like used to building back ends.

04:35:45
<transcript>: there's

04:35:53
<transcript>: There's very little that next provides for building out a backend, even like in the Docs, it's like I need a Cron job. They point till I.

04:35:54
caldotjs: came back from walking the dog and you are still streaming? Damn thats cool

04:35:55
<transcript>: Get it.

04:35:57
<transcript>: That's an approach.

04:36:03
<transcript>: I'm still streaming. I am Calva. I'm gonna read a leave. We're getting ready to raid Alt F four.

04:36:03
<transcript>: stick around

04:36:06
<transcript>: Stick around. Let's make a big raid. That'd be fun.

04:36:26
<transcript>: Yeah. So next year, it's just funny to me, like it's place in the world. I have this hunch that like if webpack weren't so bad, and if there were like a good, solid third party image component that just worked in any frontend framework, that next wouldn't have had nearly as much success. And I'm Super bullish on Versailles. I think Versell is an organization.

04:36:26
<transcript>: they've

04:36:29
<transcript>: They've hired all these amazing people.

04:36:29
<transcript>: they're

04:36:33
<transcript>: They're gonna be fine. I just think next year's, a framework.

04:36:33
<transcript>: it

04:36:44
<transcript>: It has some things going against it these days, like if you want to play with solid JS, you don't want to build and react like me. I'm kind of tired of building and react just like a sea change. I just want to try something else.

04:36:44
<transcript>: and with my

04:36:47
<transcript>: And with my extra stuff with react.

04:36:47
<transcript>: so then

04:36:57
<transcript>: So then it starts making Astro look really appealing. Like Astro and solid. I'm interested. That's where I'm at with next and I really interesting that we've got next guest Conf now so I could.

04:36:57
<transcript>: sell me

04:37:06
caldotjs: I love that! I never really got the nextjs hype. react in general. as someone who originally came from vue and svelte it always felt like a downgrade

04:37:07
<transcript>: Sell me on why I should want to keep using next JS because I don't use serverside rendering sometimes I use ISR which is nice but like Astro has answers for all of that right.

04:37:07
<transcript>: if

04:37:17
<transcript>: If you're tired of building with React and then like the Web Pack thing, Z is awesome. So like, I don't need somebody to abstract away webpack anymore. Let's just not use Webpack. You know what I'm saying.

04:37:17
<transcript>: i don't know

04:37:27
pixelmategraphics: hi there :D

04:37:28
<transcript>: I don't know. I got lots of thoughts. Lots of XGS thoughts. I'm really excited to see what I know what it's gonna be. I know next. Js. Comp is just gonna be like the edge. The edge of the edge. Move everything to the edge.

04:37:31
<transcript>: I saw the funniest thing.

04:37:35
<transcript>: They're like they have a whole blog article about how.

04:37:35
<transcript>: if

04:37:48
<transcript>: If you're building edge functions and you need to make sure that your edge function is close to your data source because that latency is more important than being close to your users. You can choose a region to run your edge phone in, and that's the most hilarious thing I've ever read. That's not an edge function.

04:37:48
<transcript>: if you're

04:37:51
<transcript>: If you're running your edge function in us east one.

04:37:51
<transcript>: it's just a function

04:37:52
whoa_dood: vercel huge U2 fans LUL

04:37:56
<transcript>: It's just a function. It's not running on the edge. So that's hilarious to me.

04:37:56
<transcript>: anyway

04:37:58
<transcript>: Anyway. Okay. I've said too much.

04:37:58
<transcript>: hi there

04:38:02
<transcript>: Hi there pixelmate graphics. Also thanks for the followup Pedro.

04:38:19
blakegreendev: Hahaha

04:38:20
<transcript>: I never really got the next JS. Hype. React in general, someone who originally came from View. And so I felt like a downgrade there's just a lot of things about react. I'm kind of tired of and that's not to say that React's not great. It's great. It's great, whatever. But like after eight years, I still feel like I'm figuring out react. And I don't think that's my fault.

04:38:20
<transcript>: i used to think

04:38:29
<transcript>: I used to think it was my fault. Like, I just don't think in terms of frontend Dev. And maybe that's true. I think front ended is harder than back in Dev. So I'm never trying to slight frontendives when I say, like.

04:38:29
<transcript>: oh that's

04:38:36
pixelmategraphics: found you through mattytwoshoes

04:38:49
<transcript>: Oh, that's what a front end Dev was. Think they would think it's a back end framework. I'm not sliding front end desk. I think front end Dev is super hard and harder than back in Dev. But like after eight years of building with React, I kind of feel like I should have figured it out by now. And the fact that I still struggle with some of the like edge cases with use effect and all of these things. I think that's Reacts fault. I don't think it's my fault.

04:38:54
<transcript>: Thank you for the false Savage banana soup. Alright, let's let's rate all F four.

04:38:54
<transcript>: let's

04:38:55
<transcript>: Let's.

04:39:08
caldotjs: WE LOVE THE RANTS

04:39:08
<transcript>: Let's be done ranting again next JS I think I've said enough tomorrow's next year's. Comp I'm hyped I'm hoping they're gonna like, totally sell me. Maybe they're gonna be like, you don't have to use React anymore. We've made it.

04:39:08
<transcript>: agnostic

04:39:10
cowfacedude99: wait. you are remember the class style components?

04:39:12
<transcript>: Agnostic of your front end framework that'd be cool.

04:39:12
<transcript>: that'd be awesome

04:39:13
<transcript>: That'd be awesome.

04:39:13
<transcript>: you

04:39:14
caldotjs: nextjs watchparty?

04:39:20
<transcript>: You remember the class style components? Oh, yeah. I remember those. I do like hook. I mean, I like that better.

04:39:20
<transcript>: but

04:39:22
<transcript>: But they just come with their own.

04:39:22
<transcript>: mix

04:39:24
<transcript>: Mixture. That's a good idea.

04:39:24
<transcript>: that's

04:39:28
<transcript>: That's a great idea. Maybe I'll do that. We'll see.

04:39:35
<transcript>: We will see Kallot. I'll definitely be streaming in the morning, so I'll see you all in the morning. Maybe we'll be playing more with this stable diffusion stuff.

04:39:35
<transcript>: maybe we'll be building

04:39:38
<transcript>: Maybe we'll be building A to be your guess. I'm not sure yet.

04:39:38
<transcript>: but

04:39:45
blakegreendev: Iâ€™m going to refer to us-east-1 as an edge location from now on lol

04:39:46
<transcript>: But I'm gonna cancel whatever the auto rate is. And we're gonna we're gonna raid all the F four. So thank you all so much. Maybe we could do it again sometime.
