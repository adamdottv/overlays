00:12:44
<transcript>: Should have included more examples. I singled out.

00:12:44
<transcript>: one situation

00:12:48
<transcript>: One situation, and everyone involved in that situation felt pretty bad.

00:12:48
<transcript>: and i don't

00:12:53
dmdboi: When Dax arrives we should all trick him into thinking Adams stopping streaming LUL

00:12:54
<transcript>: And I don't want people to feel bad. I don't want to make videos that make people feel bad. That's not my goal.

00:12:54
<transcript>: so

00:12:56
<transcript>: So took it down.

00:12:56

00:13:50
heyhemp: fair enough lol

00:13:50
<transcript>: Let's go. People who are partying in twitch chat. Yes. What's going on, gang nft Scam. I do feel like when I don't stream, I feel like this little.

00:13:50
<transcript>: group

00:14:10
<transcript>: Group of us that hang out. We don't exist anywhere else. We're not really hanging out on discord. I would love for that to be a thing. So that I don't have to stream every day just to hang out with all of you. But I feel like it's not just me hanging out with all of you. You all hang out with all of you. I guess you still get it on like dax's stream because it's a lot of the same. It's the usual suspects, a lot of overlap there.

00:14:13
<transcript>: But it is funny. It feels like.

00:14:13
<transcript>: every streamer

00:14:20
<transcript>: Every streamer. If you stream on twitch, you kind of build like your own little group of friends.

00:14:20
<transcript>: and

00:14:25
<transcript>: And if you're not streaming that friend group just doesn't exist. You have a lot of power.

00:14:31
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:14:31
<transcript>: it's a bumm

00:14:33
stroopwafel26: it's true, you're the glue that holds this group of friends together

00:14:36
<transcript>: It's a bummer. I wish we could hang out somewhere else. I wish we could all hang out in person. That'd be fun.

00:14:36
<transcript>: did you get a hair

00:14:39
<transcript>: Did you get a haircut? No. Stroke. I did not.

<transcript>: today

00:15:38
<transcript>: Today. Hi. From Brazil. I bet you're not the only Brazilian here. We have a lot of brazilians in Jet. When Dexteria, we should all trick him into thinking Adam stopping streaming. Yes. Oh, is he already here? Did I? No, he's not here. Yes. Okay, everybody, we're all in on it. When dax hits here, we convince him this is my farewell stream. I'm saying goodbye. Okay, that's all I'm going to.

00:15:38
<transcript>: say about it

00:15:45
<transcript>: Say about it. Let's just do it. If he shows up. That's what we're all going to say. I don't know. Dax seems to win those rose pedals.

00:15:58
<transcript>: Careful what you wish for Mr. Huggins is here. Well, not Mr. But M. Huggins all the same. It's true you're the glue that holds this group of friends together. It's true.

<transcript>: Am I caught up with chats? Wow.

00:16:03
<transcript>: Okay. Well.

00:16:03
<transcript>: this is

00:16:15
<transcript>: This is a whole stream where I'm just going to be chatting. So I'm going to need more of the chatting. I won't be here long. So if you think like, oh, I can't sit here and just chat without him for 3 hours. It's going to be like an hour stream.

00:16:15
<transcript>: so

00:16:19
<transcript>: So you can sit here and chat with me for an hour. Some of you can at least.

00:16:27
uberrick: I'm here to distract you and beat Statmuse. Found that DM you got funny haha

00:16:30
dmdboi: Gonna miss you Adam

00:16:33
stroopwafel26: i'm in between jobs, i have many hours

00:16:34
<transcript>: Cool. We're going to go with the silent treatment. Okay. I guess either my internet is broken, or everyone has decided not to talk. Oh, there we go. Rick's here. I'm here to distract you and beat statues.

00:16:38
charafmrah: Howdy

00:16:47
<transcript>: Going to miss me I know I'm going to miss you all too now if we do it too early diamond, we can't do it too early or we're going to convince everyone else when I'm actually leaving. What's up, Chara.

00:16:50
<transcript>: Karachara.

00:16:50
<transcript>: is it like

00:16:53
algebra97: Do you suggest to first find a client and then leave your job and make a company or leave your job, make a company and then find a client? @adamdotdev

00:16:54
dmdboi: I see no down side

00:16:57
<transcript>: Is it like care, like character. And some people call it chair and they're wrong or Char.

00:16:57
<transcript>: algebr

00:17:00
unacervezaporfavorrr: hola

00:17:07
<transcript>: Algebra. Do you suggest to first find a client and then leave your job and make a company or leave your job, make a company, and then find the client. Here's what I suggest.

00:17:14
mhuggins7278: Just listened to the latest episode of the POD how's the larvel journey going

00:17:16
<transcript>: Here's what I suggest. I'm not going to speak to the when you say find a client. I think you mean like a paying customer for your startup. I'm not going to speak to that whole debate.

00:17:16
<transcript>: like the whole

00:17:26
charafmrah: it's like "Sharaf" but you can pronounce it however you want lol

00:17:27
<transcript>: Like the whole like, should you just sell it first and then build it or build it and then sell it? I don't really have opinions on that. But in terms of whether you should leave your job first or not.

00:17:27
<transcript>: the key

00:17:30
<transcript>: The key is that you need a sustainable situation.

00:17:36
<transcript>: As much as possible. You want to remove stress from running and building a startup.

00:17:36
<transcript>: and one of the

00:17:43
<transcript>: And one of the biggest stressors you could possibly have is personal stress. Personal financial strain.

00:17:47
sj_se: yoyo adam

00:18:02
<transcript>: You're not able to pay the bills if you have a spouse. Even worse, because now they're stressed as much as possible. You want to be in a situation of strength. When you start a startup, you want to be in a situation where either you have a lot of savings and you don't need to worry about money for a while, or maybe you live with your parents. Still, I think young people.

00:18:02
<transcript>: that haven't

00:18:04
<transcript>: That haven't left home yet even.

00:18:04
<transcript>: what a great time

00:18:09
otifex: i'm looking into some better headphones for work/music whole days. do you use an amp with those sennheiser?

00:18:11
<transcript>: What a great time to build a startup because all of your needs are taken care of and you can just focus on building that startup.

00:18:15
<transcript>: Now I realize that precludes a lot of people.

00:18:15
<transcript>: because

00:18:24
<transcript>: Because you might be at a later season of life. So then it's just can you save up enough money to build a nice cushion and remove as much of that stress as possible.

00:18:24
<transcript>: you don't

00:18:30
<transcript>: You don't want to be worried about paying the bills when you're also trying to get your startup off the ground.

00:18:33
<transcript>: That's my advice. I see no downside.

00:18:35
aj_stuyvenberg: What if I move into your house Adam?

00:18:35
heyhemp: What’s the first thing thing about Laravel that blew your mind?

00:18:36
algebra97: awesome! Thanks for the answer <3

00:18:38
stroopwafel26: i can't believe this is the last ever stream

00:18:39
<transcript>: Oh, you see no downside to me. Just convincing everybody that this is my last stream.

00:18:39
<transcript>: i mean

00:18:45
<transcript>: I mean, they may feel like it's my last dream just as little as I've streamed lately. Pratima thank you for the follow.

00:18:58
dmdboi: It was a good run

00:19:03
thdxr: question what do i do if my cofounder keeps suggesting he’s doing all the work

00:19:13
<transcript>: To the latest episode of the pod. How's the Larval journey going? Larval journey going? It's going Well, I'm a little distracted because I'm going on vacation on Friday. Oh, yeah, I'm going on vacation on Friday. And then I'm going to Render Atl would love to see some of you there. Anybody going to Atlanta for render that'd be cool.

00:19:13
dmdboi: Dax is here

00:19:28
<transcript>: Yeah. So I'm going to be kind of like traveling a lot, which I don't travel lately. So it's kind of overwhelming and a lot of planning and a lot of that kind of stuff. Otherwise. Yeah. I'm just doing some benchmarking. I'm not the only one that turns out just trying to do some benchmarking compare.

00:19:29
<transcript>: compares

00:19:31
<transcript>: Compares in next.

00:19:31
<transcript>: to larry

00:19:33
stroopwafel26: i've been here since the first stream and now we're at the end

00:19:33
<transcript>: To larryvel.

00:19:33
<transcript>: lar

00:19:35
<transcript>: Larval.

00:19:43
<transcript>: With octane and all the bells. Like, how fast can we get both of them? And how do they compare? Because a lot of people come at you and you start talking about php, like performance.

00:19:47
<transcript>: I want to quiet them a little bit.

00:19:53
<transcript>: Hola Ola Una survasa.

00:19:56
algebra97: wait, what do u mean the last stream? The last for this month or like you're leaving twitch at all?

00:20:00
treasonist: php is going to be faster you'd think

00:20:02
<transcript>: It's like Sharof, but you can pronounce it however you want. Oh, no, that's way easier. Or is it Sheriff Sharof? I'm guessing that's sharof.

00:20:02
<transcript>: y

00:20:20
<transcript>: Yo? Sj looking forward to chatting. Sj did you know SJ? Redeemed, the one on one call. He was the first ever. And I'm very excited to get on a one on one call with SJ. We're going to have a good time. We're going to tell you all about it. So everyone's jealous and wants to get their own one on one.

00:20:20
<transcript>: i'm looking

00:20:26
charafmrah: yes you're pronouncing it correctly now haha

00:20:33
<transcript>: I'm looking into oh, now I'm getting behind, looking into some better headphones for work music, holidays. Do you use an amp with those sennheiser? I use an apollo Twin X is my audio interface. And that's what they're plugged into.

00:20:33
<transcript>: i believe

00:20:37
<transcript>: I believe it does have a good amplifier on it for headphones I believe.

00:20:40
unrulyhotfixer: I scoff whenever someone says php has poor performance

00:20:42
<transcript>: Now I'm talking about stuff. I don't know, but that's my whole chain.

00:20:48
<transcript>: My Apollo swine X is plugged into my Mac studio, and then my headphones are plugged into the Apollo.

00:20:55
<transcript>: What if I move into your house, Adam, great question, aj. I don't know where that came from.

00:20:55
<transcript>: but

00:21:02
<transcript>: But I love the idea. In fact, our live and nanny will probably not be here all that much longer. She's not going to stay a whole year.

00:21:05
<transcript>: For lots of reasons.

00:21:05
<transcript>: but

00:21:15
capt_crabs: i would love a live in nanny

00:21:17
<transcript>: But we're going to have a room right next to my office. Opened up. And if aj needs a place to live while he builds a startup, we could talk about it. Donald packies, thank you for the follow.

00:21:17
<transcript>: you may find

00:21:26
<transcript>: You may find yourself with more responsibilities, though aj if you move in, it may not be as easy to focus on your startup as you might like, because we would probably ask you.

00:21:26
<transcript>: to

00:21:34
<transcript>: To make all of our meals and clean the house and take care of the boys. Sometimes. Captain crabs, thank you for the follow. I appreciate it.

00:21:34
<transcript>: what's the first

00:21:41
<transcript>: What's the first thing about larryville that blew your mind? Well, I mean, it started with and I've got a video coming.

00:21:41
<transcript>: it's

00:21:43
<transcript>: It's long.

00:21:43
<transcript>: it's

00:21:45
<transcript>: It's being edited.

00:21:45
<transcript>: and poor

00:21:55
<transcript>: And poor Flip probably hates me because it's like, I mean, it's only like an hour of footage that I filmed. But the first thing I said to him was like, Could you make it like a ten minute video.

00:21:55
<transcript>: anyway

00:21:57
<transcript>: Anyway the video is my.

00:21:57
<transcript>: react

00:22:08
<transcript>: Reactions. It's my whole first, like literally first exposure to laravel after knowing about it for some time. So you'll get to see it hemp, like fully played out.

00:22:11
uberrick: @unrulyhotfixer definitely enough options to make it scale for sure

00:22:14
<transcript>: Just exactly my thoughts as I walk through all the docs and I set up a new project.

00:22:14
<transcript>: i mean the first

00:22:20
<transcript>: I mean, the first thing that blew my mind is how much functionality the Jet Stream Starter projects have.

00:22:20
<transcript>: that's insane

00:22:24
cazcik: do you need a cofounder? (through the lens of raising $ or not)

00:22:25
warrenbuffering: can you keep it down, some of us are still trying to sleep

00:22:30
heyhemp: I’m offended by your new video that’s not released yet

00:22:39
<transcript>: That's insane because I had literally just built like a pro user profile page for Sat News, and mine is like ten times worse than the one that laravel ships. And it took so much time and to imagine just starting a project and having all that stuff for free, like team support and all that stuff that blew my mind.

00:22:39
<transcript>: thanks

00:22:43
thdxr: adam spent an hour setting up laravel and has been milking it for weeks

00:22:45
<transcript>: Thanks for the answer. You're welcome. Algebra can't believe this is the last ever stream I know. Listen, it had to end eventually.

00:22:47
mhuggins7278: does flip edit everyone's  videos :D

00:22:48
<transcript>: There had to be a goodbye at some point.

00:22:48
<transcript>: and i think

00:22:52
<transcript>: And I think it's time, I think it's time to say farewell.

00:23:02
<transcript>: Captain crabs, welcome to Chat. Congrats on your last ever stream. Listen, Captain, I love that this is your first ever message on my last ever stream.

00:23:04
warrenbuffering: wait wtf, you're done streaming?

00:23:05
<transcript>: There's something poetic about that.

00:23:05
<transcript>: and

00:23:10
<transcript>: And I appreciate it. It was a good run. It was a good run, diamond. Oh, dax, is here. Dax. Question.

00:23:10
<transcript>: what

00:23:14
lowlevellearning: wait wat

00:23:14
msmazaya: Hi adam, what do you think of Phoenix? Would you recommend it for my project?

00:23:16
<transcript>: What do you say? Question, what do I do if my co founder keeps suggesting he's doing all the work.

00:23:16
<transcript>: maybe

00:23:16
mremmalex: u mean u won't stream again ?

00:23:17
uberrick: @thdxr LUL

00:23:19
<transcript>: Maybe start doing some work. Dax. Maybe.

00:23:19
<transcript>: you should

00:23:25
thdxr: what do you mean this is your last stream

00:23:30
<transcript>: You should introspect a little bit, Jackson, thank you for that. Follow. Maybe you should just think about whether there's some truth to it because I found that when people criticize you, there's generally.

00:23:30
<transcript>: there's

00:23:32
<transcript>: There's typically some truth to it.

00:23:36
msmazaya: WHAT ADAM IM NEW HERE AND YOU ARE LEAVING? IM SAD

00:23:40
<transcript>: I've been here since the first stream. And now we're at the end. I know stroop the very first stream. Oh, maybe we should reminisce and play some of my old.

00:23:44
<transcript>: First streams back. We could watch them together.

00:23:44
<transcript>: that'd be kind of

00:23:48

<transcript>: That'd be kind of fun on my last stream. Wouldn't that be good? Wait. What do you mean? The last stream? The last for this month? Or like leaving twitch. I'm done streaming forever.

00:23:53
<transcript>: it's

00:23:53
dmdboi: Like when I had a stroke

00:23:56
<transcript>: It's been a good run. I'm going to focus on other things.

00:23:56
<transcript>: and

00:23:59
<transcript>: And I'm going to retire.

00:23:59
<transcript>: in my

00:24:00
otifex: could you increase the macbook chance on the last stream? Kappa

00:24:02
<transcript>: In my prime like Michael Jordan.

00:24:10
<transcript>: Php is going to be faster than you'd think. I believe it and I believe also. It probably doesn't matter if it is a little slower or a little faster.

00:24:11
jaystation3x: I guess that makes this also my last stream. And I'm okay with that.

00:24:20
stroopwafel26: it's @jaystation3x !

00:24:30
<transcript>: People make a bigger deal out of it probably than it should be. Okay. I'm going to stop talking. You're pronouncing it correctly now. Sharof. Wow, that's so much easier to say too than getting confused every time and being like chara cara. I scoff whenever someone says php has poor performance. Yeah, you should. I would love a living nanny. Yeah.

00:24:30
<transcript>: no it's

00:24:32
<transcript>: No, it's great.

00:24:32
<transcript>: i wouldn't recommend

00:24:33
jaystation3x: Thanks for giving me an excuse to try Twitch. 😅

00:24:33
<transcript>: I wouldn't recommend.

00:24:34
daglee: So, if nobody wins today, the macbook was a scam?! ;)

00:24:42
<transcript>: Your best friend being your living nanny because it just puts strain on the friendship in ways that just don't hire your best friend.

00:24:42
<transcript>: that

00:24:47
<transcript>: That's a problem. And that's what we ran into. Everyone's happy. We're all good.

00:24:53
<transcript>: We're going to cut it off before it gets bad, before it hurts relationships anyway.

00:24:53
<transcript>: definitely

00:24:56
warrenbuffering: BOOOOOOOO

00:25:02
<transcript>: Definitely enough options to make it scale for sure. Do you need a co founder through the lens of raising money or not? So I will say kazakh, lots of people.

00:25:02
<transcript>: lots of

00:25:04
<transcript>: Lots of people.

00:25:04
<transcript>: believe

00:25:07
<transcript>: Believe that you should have a co founder.

00:25:07
<transcript>: and

00:25:08
thdxr: remember when i was asking in the beginning how do you have a employer relationship with a friend

00:25:12
kociqq: Hello ayezeeHey

00:25:15
thdxr: when you were hiring her as your nanny

00:25:15
<transcript>: And those people the vin diagram of people who believe you should have a gofunder and people who have money to invest venture capital.

00:25:15
<transcript>: almost

00:25:17
<transcript>: Almost a circle.

00:25:17
<transcript>: so

00:25:18
<transcript>: So.

00:25:18
<transcript>: invest

00:25:34
<transcript>: Investors definitely seem to prefer people having cofounders. But what investors seem to miss is that it's all random. They get lucky on some companies. And there's plenty of examples of solo cofounder or solo founders that have done huge things.

00:25:40
algebra97: im both happy and sad at the same time for this being the last stream :') wishing you all the best in your future

00:25:41
<transcript>: I think those stupid spreadsheets I get so bothered whenever I see some of the spreadsheets that investors use.

00:25:41
<transcript>: the criter

00:25:49
<transcript>: The criteria that they wait. Did they go to Stanford? That's a boost the technical cofounder. Stanford kay got it just so dumb.

00:25:49
<transcript>: it's just like

00:25:50
<transcript>: It's just like.

00:26:02
stroopwafel26: maybe this last stream joke was a bad idea, now chat is sad

00:26:09
<transcript>: They haven't really figured out the reality of what makes successful companies because it's more complex than any model or whatever could ever figure out. But they have to spend their little webs and make educated decisions. I don't know. The whole thing just bothers me. So do you need a cofounder for raising? Maybe. Do you need one for actually building a business.

00:26:09
<transcript>: maybe

00:26:13
<transcript>: Maybe. I don't know. I think it's a lot of maybes it just depends on the situation.

00:26:15
dmdboi: It was a joke?

00:26:20
<transcript>: Warren's here. Can you keep it down? Some of us are still trying to sleep. I'm offended by your new video. That's not really.

00:26:20
<transcript>: thank you

00:26:24
stroopwafel26: maybe?

00:26:24
<transcript>: Thank you, hemp. I needed to know that someone was already offended.

00:26:36
<transcript>: Before I published it. And I'm not just finding out after at least I've got a little warning. That feels good. Adam spent an hour setting up laravel and has been milking it for weeks. Oh, my God.

00:26:52
<transcript>: Even if I never touch larval, I want to call it larval now, because somebody keeps saying that even if I never touch laravel again, I did my part. Okay? I did my part. I genuinely believe it's. Awesome.

00:26:52
<transcript>: i need to

00:26:57
mhuggins7278: no more streaming because he's picking up the lambo this week

00:26:59
dmdboi: One last try before the end

00:27:02
<transcript>: I need to build something new with it because I was going to build that one thing, and then we found it already existed. So then we just played with that thing. I need to build something new so I can really assess it.

00:27:08
<transcript>: But I haven't built a new project to find out. So.

00:27:08
<transcript>: just get

00:27:16
<transcript>: Just get off my back. Does Flip edit everyone's videos? Yeah, he's the tech YouTube editor.

00:27:20
<transcript>: Wait. You're done streaming? Wait. What.

00:27:20
<transcript>: hi adam

00:27:23
<transcript>: Hi, Adam. What do you think of Phoenix? Would you recommend it for my project.

00:27:23
<transcript>: phoenix

00:27:25
<transcript>: Phoenix is okay.

00:27:36
<transcript>: So here's the thing. My experience with elixir in Phoenix is one repo. It is the Statinus Web backend, and it is giant.

00:27:43
<transcript>: Like huge and it bothers me working in that code base so it jades my perception.

00:27:43
<transcript>: like it taint

00:27:51
<transcript>: Like it taints it. Now I view Phoenix as just this very hard thing to work in. It's so slow and my lsp doesn't work and.

00:27:51
<transcript>: that's not

00:27:56
saltyohm: heh, he said taint

00:27:56
<transcript>: That's not elixir in phoenix's fault. That's just huge, complex code base. I will say.

00:27:56
<transcript>: these

00:28:00
charafmrah: Will SST support Laravel now @thdxr

00:28:02
<transcript>: These frameworks that there's so many files in the whole mvc stuff.

00:28:12
<transcript>: I wish we could bring that's the only part of the Twitter stack, the modern web stuff that I like, which is like very terse.

00:28:12
<transcript>: and less boile

00:28:13
<transcript>: And less boilerplate.

00:28:13
<transcript>: if we could

00:28:24
<transcript>: If we could bring that into the frameworks that are fully batteries included, I would appreciate it. That's the only thing though I don't want to bring anything else. They can keep their type, safety and their whatever. I don't care.

00:28:28
<transcript>: I want to extract the conciseness.

00:28:28
<transcript>: and

00:28:44
<transcript>: And the informalness if you will like the architectural formalities of mvc bother me a little bit like when I want to create a new page and I have to make like four files. I guess it's probably the same these days with nextjs and the app router and all that. There's a lot of files I don't know.

00:28:44
<transcript>: i could do

00:28:55
<transcript>: I could do without that part. Okay. You mean you won't stream again, Mr. Emmett licks? Yeah, this is final stream. This is my goodbye stream. I'm going out on top.

00:28:58
thdxr: i feel like adam would go out on a bigger bang if it’s real

00:29:01
<transcript>: I'm going to retire before people are tired of me. I started seeing some murmurs that people don't like my stuff.

00:29:11
dinisskizee: Hello :D

00:29:11
<transcript>: And I want to get out before people are really just sick of me streaming. So this will be my final stream. I'm retiring at 36.

00:29:15
thdxr: what

00:29:18
adjectiveallison: Adam I'm here to help you with your next youtube video content

00:29:18
<transcript>: What do you mean? This year? Last stream? I think I explained it. Dax. What? Adam. I'm new here. And you're leaving. I'm sad.

00:29:18
<transcript>: ms

00:29:20
<transcript>: Ms.

00:29:20
<transcript>: maz

00:29:23
<transcript>: Mazaya, I would have had your name down but you're new.

00:29:23
<transcript>: i'm sorry

00:29:24
thdxr: who’s sick of you

00:29:24
<transcript>: I'm sorry.

00:29:24
<transcript>: there has

00:29:27
grasp5533: Wait no more Adam streams???

00:29:30
<transcript>: There has to be an end to everything. You can go back and watch the vods pretend like they're live.

00:29:30
<transcript>: that'd be

00:29:34
thdxr: can i have your equipment

00:29:38
<transcript>: That'd be fun. I mean, there would be less interactivity. Play the best clips. Let's play the best clips on my final stream. That would be fun.

00:29:38
<transcript>: good morning

00:29:39
dinisskizee: what the hell, last stream

00:29:40
<transcript>: Good morning. Salty.

00:29:40
<transcript>: like when

00:29:42
dmdboi: Can I have your solar panels

00:29:45
<transcript>: Like when I had a stroke? Yeah, diamond had a stroke on my stream. That was fun.

00:29:45
<transcript>: could

00:29:53
<transcript>: Could you increase the macbook chance on the last stream? Oh, that's a good idea, Jay's here. I guess that makes this also my last dream. And I'm okay with that.

00:29:54
grasp5533: Is this because of Theo

00:29:59
stroopwafel26: strokewafel

00:30:01
<transcript>: Thanks for giving me an excuse to try twitch. Nate does have to be your last J. You can go watch dax. He's a lot like me.

00:30:05
<transcript>: I feel that a lot of people that like me also, like DAX.

00:30:11
<transcript>: In reverse. Visa versa. Vice versa.

00:30:11
<transcript>: let's see

00:30:15
<transcript>: Let's see if nobody wins today. The macbook was a scam.

00:30:15
<transcript>: it was not

00:30:16
whrew: wait is this a bit or he is serious?

00:30:17
<transcript>: It was not a scam.

00:30:17
<transcript>: it's just it was

00:30:18
<transcript>: It's just. It was.

00:30:20
<transcript>: In the cards.

00:30:22
<transcript>: Boo.

00:30:22
<transcript>: remember

00:30:27
<transcript>: Remember when I was asking in the beginning, how do you have an employer relationship with a friend.

00:30:28
kelyje: dax's beard is more awesome, than adam's ))

00:30:47
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. You called it when you're hiring her as your nanny. You called it. Dax should have just listened to you from the start. I'm going to start asking you before I make any big life decisions. I really should have done that from the start. Hello, cosie I'm both happy and sad at the same time for this being the last dream. Wishing you all the best in your future. Thank you so much, algebra. Maybe this last dream joke was a bad idea. Now, Chad is.

00:30:58
dinisskizee: WTF

00:31:01
dinisskizee: I LITERALLY GOT ANXIOUS

00:31:02
msmazaya: WHAT THE FUCK ADAM THANK YOU

00:31:02
<transcript>: Sad. It was a joke. Maybe. Yeah. Okay. It's not my last dream. We've just been messing around. Somebody said we should convince dax when he gets here. That this is adam's farewell stream. So that's what we just did. We convinced dax. I don't know if you believed it, but that was fun.

00:31:06
lowlevellearning: emotional_damage.mp3

00:31:07
<transcript>: No more streaming because he's picking up the lambo this week. Exactly.

00:31:09
uberrick: I'm impressed you kept the joke going for that long though

00:31:17
dinisskizee: NotLikeThis

00:31:19
warrenbuffering: WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT I SMASHED MY COMPUTER

00:31:24
satyam4real: emotional damage

00:31:24
kociqq: It can be last stream today tho?

00:31:27
<transcript>: Will sst support laravel now, dax. That's a great question, dax. I feel Adam would go out on a bigger bang if it's real. Hello, denny's. Here. Adam. I'm here to help you with your next YouTube video content, please, allison. Someone tell me what to make on YouTube. Who's sick of you? Wait. No more Adam. Streams. Can I have your equipment.

00:31:30
<transcript>: That turned fast.

00:31:30
dmdboi: LUL Im not sorry

00:31:31
kociqq: so we are not lying?

00:31:33
stroopwafel26: @warrenbuffering you just won a macbook

00:31:35
<transcript>: I'm so sad. But could I have all of your cameras, please.

00:31:41
<transcript>: I literally got anxious. I'm so sorry if I made anybody nervous.

00:31:41
<transcript>: i'm not going to

00:31:45
<transcript>: I'm not going to leave streaming. I'll always stream on some frequency.

00:31:48
uberrick: can I get the adam.tv domain?

00:31:49
warrenbuffering: that's fantastic timing

00:31:51
adjectiveallison: Can you overview why you're last 2 videos were bad? Then I can throw you a bunch of ideas and then I gotta go.

00:31:54
<transcript>: I guess maybe when I'm 55, I'll be like, maybe I'm not cool enough for twitch anymore. But we got 20 years where I'm going to be here.

00:31:57
<transcript>: Can I have your solar panels.

00:32:02
<transcript>: Just because theo. No, this isn't because of theo. Stroke. Waffle.

00:32:02
<transcript>: wait

00:32:05
<transcript>: Wait, is this a bit.

00:32:05
<transcript>: true it's like

00:32:25
<transcript>: True. It's like shrew. But fru. Welcome to Chat. It is a bit. I think we've established it now. I'm just behind on chat. Dax's beard is more awesome than Adams. It's true. Literally. Got anxious. I'm sorry. Emotional damage. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm impressed. You kept the joke going for that long. Well, it's easy to keep a joke going for that long on my Twitch because I read every message and it takes me forever.

00:32:25
<transcript>: and

00:32:29
charafmrah: can I have your keyboard & sauna?

00:32:29
<transcript>: And so there's like a natural cadence that's very behind.

00:32:37
<transcript>: Yeah, so it's not too hard. Why would you do that? I smash my computer. Oh, no. Warren can't even watch me anymore.

00:32:37
<transcript>: it would have been

00:32:40
kryotoboi: Can I have the HD 650s ?

00:32:50
jaystation3x: Can I have your Larabar?

00:32:53
daglee: Guys stop being material! Can I have the larbars?!

00:32:54
stroopwafel26: can i have your hair?

00:32:55
<transcript>: It would have been funny if people started actually telling me off or like I didn't like your streams anyway. Like if we could have somehow gotten to some point where somebody was upset and they said something hateful and then they can't take it back and it's like it was a joke. I'm sorry that would have been funny, but it probably unrealistic not going to happen. Let's see.

00:32:57
<transcript>: Emotional damage. Welcome to chat.

00:32:57
<transcript>: sat yum

00:33:02
themrsacs: If I waited till I was cool enough to do anything I'd never get anything done.

00:33:02
<transcript>: Sat yum. I'm so sorry it can be live stream today. It could be I mean, here's the thing.

00:33:05
elicxlive: i just imagined dax blowing up your dms about it

00:33:05
charafmrah: or I guess you do need the sauna when you're retired, so the keyboard is enough

00:33:10
<transcript>: I could retire. And I can just always come back. It means nothing. Michael Jordan, Tom Brady, look, people retire. They come back.

00:33:10
<transcript>: not

00:33:12
<transcript>: Not saying.

00:33:12
<transcript>: that makes

00:33:16
mhuggins7278: shit you mean I shouldn't have tweeted the pic of you with the broken larabar and the crying emoji

00:33:19
<transcript>: That makes it sound like I think I'm the greatest of all time at streaming on twitch. That's not what I think. But I'm just saying.

00:33:19
<transcript>: people retire

00:33:20
misterreboot: have you built that laravel project yet?

00:33:29
<transcript>: People retire and unretire all the time so I could just I could say Today, I'm retired, and then when I start streaming again tomorrow I unretired. I'm back.

00:33:29
<transcript>: okay

00:33:35
<transcript>: Okay, you just want a macbook? Who want a macbook? Can I get the Adam TV domain.

00:33:39
sunny1hd: Hello

00:33:50
schrew: Adam "The Michael Jordan of Twitch" Elmore

00:33:55
<transcript>: That's funny. Fantastic timing. Can you overview why your last two videos were bad? Then I can throw you a bunch of ideas, and then I got to go. Yes, allison, they were bad because people got mad at me. And in one case, I had to take the video down. That's why they were bad. If you could give me some ideas that literally no one could be upset about. That's what I'm looking for.

00:33:55
<transcript>: invictor thank you

00:33:57
<transcript>: Invictor thank you for the follow.

00:34:05
lowlevellearning: honestly if people get mad in youtube comments fucke m

00:34:06
1camou: there will always be someone upset

00:34:07
<transcript>: Shark, can I have your keyboard? Sauna? Can I have the HD 60s? This is funny. Can I have your Lar bar? Guys, stop being material. Can I have the large bars.

00:34:08
lowlevellearning: em **

00:34:09
frontendfyi: Make a video about pineapple on top of pizza

00:34:10
treasonist: bad reason to take videos down imo :\

00:34:12
stroopwafel26: @Schrew ... of the Ozarks

00:34:13
mattmancodes: It's the internet, someone will always be upset

00:34:14
<transcript>: Dagley's here. Can I have your hair? My hair. Everyone. We've established my hair is no good.

00:34:14
schrew: Genuinely forgot your last name because of all the successful adam.tv branding

00:34:18
frontendfyi: Oh wrong account ,brb

00:34:21
grasp5533: I don’t think the videos were bad. They just mad.

00:34:23
<transcript>: If I waited. Welcome to Chat. The Mr. Sachs. So I waited till I was cool enough to do anything. I'd never get anything done. It's so true.

00:34:23
<transcript>: it's so true

00:34:32
<transcript>: It's so true, Alex. I just imagine dax blowing up your DMs about it. Oh, did it if he really cares if he's a real friend. I'll have DMs right now. Hang on, let's see.

00:34:42
dinisskizee: -1 DM

00:34:44
<transcript>: I had a dm. No, I didn't have a dm. It's from earlier. Dax. I see. I see how it is. I see what our friendship really means to you.

00:34:44
<transcript>: didn't even

00:34:47
<transcript>: Didn't even DM me about quitting streaming whatever.

00:34:54
thdxr: i did send a dm and i deleted it lmaooo

00:34:56
heyhemp: @Schrew me too

00:34:57
thdxr: hahahah

00:34:57
uberrick: @Schrew his last name is now Dotdev

00:35:01
elicxlive: rofl

00:35:01
<transcript>: Or I guess I do need. I guess you do need the sauna when you're retired. So the keyboard is enough. Yeah, sure. I'll ship the keyboard. You can have them. You mean I shouldn't have tweeted the pick of you with the broken Lar bar in the cry.

00:35:08
<transcript>: That's a good one. Have you built that larvae project? No Mr. Robot or reboot. We.

00:35:08
<transcript>: found

00:35:15
<transcript>: Found something. So the day I was going to build that project, we found a project that already exists that does everything I wanted it to do.

00:35:15
<transcript>: so

00:35:19
unrulyhotfixer: i feel like making a video that everyone loves is impossible these days. personally i like all your videos

00:35:21
<transcript>: So I don't need to build that project. I need a new thing that I need to build. I might just build the cooking thing for my wife.

00:35:21
<transcript>: she wants

00:35:26
<transcript>: She wants it. I know it would save us a ton of time every week.

00:35:29
<transcript>: Might be a good reason to learn. Laravel.

00:35:31
stroopwafel26: @thdxr awww a real friend

00:35:31
<transcript>: Hello, Sonny.

00:35:42
<transcript>: Adam to the michael's runs of twitch elmore. That's right. Honestly, if people get mad in YouTube comments, fuck them. It's not actually the YouTube comments low level.

00:35:46
warrenbuffering: did you forget about gram gram?

00:35:50
<transcript>: It was dms. It was people I know pretty well getting upset with me. If it were just random people, I don't care.

00:35:51
lowlevellearning: oh sad

00:36:01
<transcript>: Everyone doesn't know this about me, but I've literally never been offended in my life. I don't have enough emotional depth to be offended, so I think I've cut out for social media.

00:36:01
<transcript>: i think

00:36:15
<transcript>: I think people get upset when people are upset with them. I don't like people upset with me, but I don't care about YouTube comments. I'll never delete a YouTube comment. I just don't care. There's nothing someone's going to say to me that is going to affect my personhood.

00:36:15
<transcript>: this was

00:36:22
<transcript>: This was a different situation. This was people who genuinely were upset, felt like I was attacking them or sharing things I shouldn't share.

00:36:22
<transcript>: it was a difference

00:36:24
<transcript>: It was a difference situation.

00:36:27
bishopdev: I can try though :D

00:36:27
julianvelez1: Hello

00:36:28
jaystation3x: Never offended? Hold my beer.

00:36:30
elicxlive: the sad part is that it was a genuinely good video on the topic, it's just some people misinterpreted it :(

00:36:34
<transcript>: There will always be some of us that. Yeah, these were different. It wasn't like, I don't care if I make a video and people on YouTube are upset. I don't care. This was more like.

00:36:34
<transcript>: friends and

00:36:38
julianvelez1: SeemsGood

00:36:52
<transcript>: Friends and people I'm friendly with being upset and that's different. Make a video about Pineapple on Top of Pizza. Welcome to Chat. Front end fyi. I love this idea. I love Pineapple on pizza. I don't understand why that's even a topic and why people get upset when you talk about pineapple and pizza. I think it's hilarious. Sometimes I say it just because people get really upset.

00:36:52
<transcript>: what a weird thing

00:36:53
julianvelez1: How are you bro

00:36:58
<transcript>: What a weird thing to have strong opinions about. In my opinion. Lucas, thank you for the follow.

00:37:10
bishopdev: can we all report adam to twitch so he gets banned ? I think they have rules against pineapple on pizza

00:37:14
<transcript>: Bad reason to take videos down. Maybe. Yeah, maybe. I mean, I was back and forth. It was really hard to take one down. It just feels weird. I don't delete tweets if I can avoid it, I don't take videos down if I can avoid it. Julian velas, thank you for the follow.

dinisskizee: in 2024, I want to get a new job and upgrade, I would love to work remote for the US. Do you think its easy to get a mid-level role? ts, go, react, aws...

00:37:22
<transcript>: Okay, it's the Internet. Someone will always be upset. Genuinely forgot your last name because of all successful Adam TV branding.

00:37:22
<transcript>: funny

00:37:23
<transcript>: Funny.

00:37:37
<transcript>: what you

00:37:40
wagslane: Get outta Laravel and jump into Go. Then I'll be happy

00:37:42
<transcript>: What? You sent me a dm. I did see a dm. I deleted it.

00:37:51
<transcript>: No, I want to know what it said next. Don't delete it. The internet needs to be preserved. Don't delete stuff. That reminds me. I got to check if the domain is available.

00:37:51
<transcript>: one second

00:37:52
<transcript>: 1 second.

00:38:12
<transcript>: When somebody mentioned that the zip domain.

00:38:12
<transcript>: was available

00:38:17
<transcript>: Was available now I wanted to check archive zip. I don't know why thought that'd be a good domain.

00:38:28
<transcript>: gen

00:38:30
<transcript>: Genuinely.

00:38:36
<transcript>: This was more of this was not that a lot of people were upset. It was literally that one person was very upset.

00:38:39
msmazaya: Any advice for someone who wants to start their own company, any advice?

00:38:46
<transcript>: So different math for me if it's a lot of people upset, but they're all mildly upset. I can deal with that one person really upset. I had to look at myself in the mirror.

00:38:46
<transcript>: introspect

00:38:49
<transcript>: Introspect a little bit and I made mistakes.

00:38:52
<transcript>: I know I made a mistake in that video.

00:38:52
<transcript>: in the way

00:39:00
<transcript>: In the way that I presented, the information should have provided more examples, and that's on me. So I'm okay moving on.

00:39:00
<transcript>: let's see

00:39:01

danielgerep: Hey Adam, good morning. How do you manage side projects + work with family time? It is super hard for me, but I know I'm missing something because we all have the same 24 hours :D

00:39:14
<transcript>: I can try, though. Hello, Julian. Welcome to Chat. Never offended. Hold my beard.

00:39:19
<transcript>: Can you offend me, Jay, you might be able to.

00:39:22
<transcript>: If I've ever been offended.

00:39:24
kryotoboi: Do people generally use Go for microservices ?

00:39:32
<transcript>: It would have to be somebody close to me. And Jay, you might be able to do it. I don't know. Dax couldn't. I don't think DAX could have fit me. But DAX is always so mean that.

00:39:32
<transcript>: like

00:39:33
jaystation3x: Can you make a YouTube video being a professional reference for me so I can send it to Christine?

00:39:34

00:39:34
warrenbuffering: gram-gram's website, you were gonna build it in C

00:39:35
<transcript>: Meaner.

00:39:40
wagslane: Gerep? Good to see you in here man

00:39:48
<transcript>: And try to offend me, you might be able to offend me, Jay, I'm just trying to think with our history, like what you might be able to throw at me that would offend me. Sad part is that it was a genuinely good video on the topic. It's just some people misinterpret it.

00:39:48
<transcript>: how are you

00:39:51
<transcript>: How are you? I'm good. How are you? Julian.

<transcript>: Let's see. Can we all report Adam to twitch so he gets banned? I think they have rules against pineapple on pizza. People get so worked up about pineapple and pizza in 2024. I want to get a new job and upgrade. I would love to work remote for the US. Do you think it's easy to get a mid level role? Ts go react. Aws. I don't know what to think, denny. I don't know what.

00:40:11
<transcript>: to think

00:40:14
thatcrablanguageenjoyer: oh cool, its the Laravel guy

bishopdev: @thdxr know if he's adopting ?

00:40:20
<transcript>: My co founder was opposed to hiring international people remote because of all the laws.

00:40:24
danielgerep: @thdxr haha maybe that his trick?

00:40:34
<transcript>: As an American startup, we had to have, like, a nexus in countries to hire people there. It was just a lot of hoops. I hope somebody solves that problem. Maybe they already have in ten years. Maybe somebody has an organization or something that you can hire through that solves that problem.

00:40:45
<transcript>: But that was a problem that we faced now, easy to get a mid level role. That's the question. I don't know what's going to happen to the hiring market. And on what time horizon.

00:40:45
<transcript>: we were

00:40:52
<transcript>: A bubble, maybe. And terms of tech pay and tech jobs.

00:40:52
<transcript>: and then that

00:41:05
<transcript>: And then that bubble kind of crashed. Or maybe it's still crashing. I don't know. And then the question now, like the timing of AI and productivity with developers. Will people hire back as many developers? I don't know. These are all questions I have.

00:41:05
<transcript>: and

00:41:11
<transcript>: And I wish I had answers. I'm sorry, denny. That didn't provide a lot.

00:41:21
<transcript>: You can always build stuff for yourself. You can always just go out there and try to just do your own thing. If you're in a good situation to do that.

<transcript>: Nobody can get upset about that, right? Get out of laravel and jump into Go. Then I'll be happy. Hey, wags Lane. I do like, Go. I mean, I don't know if I like, Go. I don't like any technology. I don't think.

00:41:37
<transcript>: i

00:41:37
mattmancodes: I know people in the UK who have had remote roles for US companies (it was a startup) so I guess it is possible, or illegal... One of the two

00:41:39
<transcript>: I use them.

00:41:39
<transcript>: i put up

00:41:43
<transcript>: I put up with them. I don't become fans of anything I don't know.

00:41:51
<transcript>: But I also don't get too upset. I think I just don't have enough awareness to notice what I like and dislike about things. So they're all just kind of in the same.

00:41:58
<transcript>: Lumped category. Okay, my favorite pizza is banana, chicken, Curry and peanuts. That's interesting.

00:41:58
<transcript>: i've never heard

00:42:15
<transcript>: I've never heard of that one. Banana and pizza. But you know what? You know what? I'm not upset. I'm not upset. I don't care what people eat on their pizza. What's wrong with you people? Why do you get upset about the pineapple and the pizza? I said, why quitting streaming? Okay, yeah, let's just take it public. Let's just have our conversation here.

00:42:21
<transcript>: This was front end fy. This is my personal account. I follow you with Jerome.

00:42:21

charafmrah: Would you be willing to do a portfolio website review stream/video?

00:42:35
<transcript>: I got you. I didn't know you were also front end fyi. Is that like a website? Adam buys another domain. Explain like I'm five zip. That's a good one. I snagged. Hey, hungry. I'm dad.

00:42:38
<transcript>: That's funny. Warren.

00:42:38
<transcript>: any advice

00:42:40
aisebaxp: Pizzaplple nooooooooooo shame ! Hehehehe PizzaTime

00:42:41
<transcript>: Any advice for someone who wants to start their own company. Any advice.

00:42:41
<transcript>: that

00:42:52
<transcript>: That's a broad one. The advice I gave at the beginning of Stream, somebody asked kind of a similar question. My biggest advice is make sure you're in a good position in life. Things are at a nice, steady plane of existence.

00:42:52
<transcript>: you're finan

00:43:10
dmdboi: Anyone got any project names I can steal?

00:43:12
<transcript>: You're financially set up and okay to weather several months without any income potentially. And even once you do have income, it being pretty low. That's another thing. When we started samuels, we knew we'd go a while before we raise money. What I didn't factor in was that I would never make the money I made before I started a startup. As a founder, you're going to pay yourself a salary. We are always going to be trying to.

00:43:19
dmdboi: Struggling to think of ones with available domains

00:43:26
jeroenreumkens: frontend.fyi is definitely a website. Don't want to promote myself here, haha. Trying the YouTube thing teaching frontend. Around 25 vids in now. Wanna try Twitch soon, you're a big inspiration for that!

00:43:26
sunny1hd: Is it ok to ask for some advice; I am a web developer but have not specialised in a certain field. worked with c# a bit but my skills are more frontend. Relearning frontend and JS, though find myself being stuck in tutorial hell.

00:43:30
nexxeln: hi everyone

00:43:33
<transcript>: Maximize runway and worry about how much runway and capital you have. And in that sense, you're never going to pay yourself a lot. So it was a long time before I ever started making a lot of money again. And that was after I left that muse. So while you're a founder, you're probably not going to make a lot of cash. But the dream is to make a lot of enterprise value.

00:43:33
mattmancodes: @dmdboi Ask ChatGPT

00:43:38
theuseazone: why people move to Laravel from NextJS ? curious

00:43:38
<transcript>: To create a lot of value and capture that later with some positive outcome.

00:43:52
<transcript>: But, yeah, you just kind of got to be prepared for that financially. You don't want to be stressed about money personally, there's a lot of stress for me because we went a long time without raising, and it created a lot of stress for both of us. My co founder and I.

00:43:52
<transcript>: and

00:44:03
thdxr: nexxel is here

00:44:03
<transcript>: And you don't want that. You don't want that in the middle. It's just hard enough to build a startup. You don't want to be financially strained. Hey, Adam. Good morning, daniel's. Here. How do you manage side projects.

00:44:04
bishopdev: @theuseazone no one's doing that, adam would like to make you think that though

00:44:06
kampouse: @theuseazone cause there now similar lol

00:44:12
<transcript>: I'm way behind now. How do you manage to have projects plus work with family time? It is super hard for me, but I know I'm missing something because we all have the same 24 hours.

00:44:12
<transcript>: i

00:44:13
jaystation3x: You said it! I can't believe it! "Enterprise Value" is a classic Cards Against StatMuse card.

00:44:21
<transcript>: I saw prime answer this question. Somebody asked the same question on Twitter and I think this is probably what I do, he said, just being intentional with all time.

00:44:21
thdxr: adam when are we working on rebase

00:44:28
<transcript>: So I think when you see people that you feel like they're doing a lot more, then you could ever do in your day.

00:44:30
<transcript>: They're probably not doing a lot of things.

00:44:31
nexxeln: dax is here

<transcript>: That's it.

00:44:53
<transcript>: i mean

00:47:57
<transcript>: I feel like I shouldn't talk about it. We haven't talked enough privately for me to feel good talking about it publicly, but just know that I know I made a mistake.

00:47:57

fredyfumier: I have built a live streaming website. It can scale horizontally so I'm able to live stream whatever I want to thousands, for as long as I want, simply by dragging and dropping video files into a folder. My idea was to broadcast content with that service 24/7 and add functionalities over time until (maybe) it reaches product market fit and I find a way to monetize it, but I'm put off by the egress traffic rates at GCP (and I suspect every cloud provider is the same). What do I do ?

00:48:07
<transcript>: I wouldn't take the video down if I didn't think I made a mistake. And I know I made a mistake. Can you hire them as contractors? And it becomes much easier.

00:48:09

00:48:17
<transcript>: are

00:48:21
<transcript>: Are the number one tool we have and our little tool belt.

00:48:21
<transcript>: when we're out

00:48:30
<transcript>: When we're out trying to find people to work for us at our startup, the number one carrot we have is you get some equity, you'll get some options.

00:48:36
<transcript>: And so if you can't hire them full time and give them equity, you feel like they're not aligned.

00:48:39
<transcript>: They're not going to give them everything.

00:48:39
<transcript>: or give

00:48:47
<transcript>: Or give you everything? It's so shady. I hate it. I hate it so much. So many things about Silicon Valley that I dislike.

<transcript>: But yeah, I think that was the thing. Can you hire them as a contractor and still incentivize them with options from the employee equity pool? I don't know, but that's I think where the hang up was.

00:49:11
<transcript>: Noctate. Hey, Adam, what do you think about Phoenix liveview? I've never used Live view. I need to look into it. Is it like livewire in laravel? Same mechanism. Is it similar? Whoa, texa portier.

00:49:11
<transcript>: i know people

00:49:18
<transcript>: I know people in the UK who have had remote roles for US companies. It was a startup, so I guess it's possible or illegal. One of the two.

00:49:27
chrispian: Yeah, it's similar to Livewire. It inspired Livewire.

00:49:36
thdxr: everyone stop asking adam boring questions and start asking the tough questions

00:49:38
<transcript>: Would you be willing to do a portfolio website? Review stream? Video? Hey, shar. Yes. Let's do that. Maybe my next stream will just be like reviewing things. You send me links. I will review them. It could be your resume. It could be your portfolio website. It could be your profile photo. It could be whatever. But I'll review it.

00:49:41
daglee: Next stream?!

00:49:49
<transcript>: Pizza Apple no shame. Anyone got any project names I can steal? Struggling to think of the ones with available domains. I hate that phase of a new project. Diamond. I hate it.

00:49:49
<transcript>: friend and fy

00:49:49
bytepala: no it's not same. underline technology different

00:49:50
<transcript>: Friend and FY is definitely a website.

00:49:50
<transcript>: don't want to promote

00:49:51
kampouse: @thdxr is sst anygood?

00:50:00
<transcript>: Don't want to promote myself here. No, you're good trying a YouTube thing teaching front end around 25 minutes. Now want to try twitch soon. Your biggest raceman. Wow, jerome, thank you so much. I know.

00:50:03
thdxr: for example: adam do you have any comments on the rumor that you have a secret second family?

00:50:11
<transcript>: I've seen of I've seen friend nfy I know I've seen that name and it's not new to me and I'm going to open it up rather browser so I don't forget to check it out.

00:50:11

stroopwafel26: lol

<transcript>: Anyone. Let's see.

00:50:20
lilsammy777: what are you build with larval at the moment?

00:50:20
oscr_dev: I've made this site to help choose domains https://ace.domains

00:50:27
<transcript>: Is it okay to ask for some advice? Of course I'm a web developer, but have not specialized in a certain field. Worked with C sharp a bit. Oh, my chat jumps. I'm so behind again.

00:50:29
mattmancodes: @thdxr LUL LUL LUL

00:50:31
<transcript>: It jumped. Where did it go? Where did it go.

00:50:32
texoport: @thdxr the one you're secretly raising with him? :o

00:50:33
kryotoboi: Adam can you please review the PRs that I have to review.  Its very tiring

00:50:35
<transcript>: Oh, I'm so behind. Okay. I'm going to have to.

00:50:40
<transcript>: Just go faster? Oh, Jeez.

00:50:43
<transcript>: I was that behind.

00:50:44
<transcript>: No way.

00:50:50

00:51:02
kampouse: adam you have any rumor about @thdxr ?

00:51:06
<transcript>: Why did we not socialize in social field work with C. Sharp a bit, but my skills are more front end. We learned front end and js they'll find myself being stuck in tutorial. Hell, build something, build something you want to exist. Don't watch another tutorial, just not another video. Just get off YouTube.

00:51:06
<transcript>: literally just

00:51:12
pbertrand_dev: @thdxr Do you think his second secret wife actually likes him?

00:51:14
stroopwafel26: dax fact time

00:51:26
<transcript>: Literally just pick something that you want to exist. If you want it to exist, you'll be more incentivized to build it and you'll know what it needs to do and what the minimum thing you need to put out there that does it for you. It doesn't have to be for other people. Just find something that you want to exist that will help you in your digital life and build it. That's my advice. It's pretty generic, but I think it applies to anybody.

00:51:30
<transcript>: Who feels like they're stuck in tutorial? Hell for sure.

00:51:30
<transcript>: okay

00:51:31

00:52:08
thdxr: @pbertrand_dev no

00:52:11
<transcript>: I'm running some ruse trying to pump up larvo. Like, what do I get out of that? Why would I? Why would I scam people into liking a new technology? I have no motivation to do that.

00:56:07
<transcript>: I feel like everyone on the Internet, I'm friendly with everyone in varying degrees, getting to know them better all the time. This is a person that I really respect, and that reached out. And I think they saw me get some controversy in, like, hey, maybe you don't mind controversy. You want to make this video with me, they want to do something together. And I think we're going to poke at just.

00:57:36
<transcript>: You can scale horizontally horizontally so I'm able to live stream whenever I want to thousands for as long as I want simply by dragging and dropping video files into a folder. Interesting, my idea was to broadcast content from that service twenty four seven and add functionalities over time. Maybe it reaches prudential market fit and I find a way to monetize it. But I'm put off by the egress traffic rates at gcp.

00:58:32
<transcript>: here

00:58:36
<transcript>: Here's my comment. I've never heard that rumor, but that's funny.

00:58:43
<transcript>: I literally never leave my house. I am the least likely person in the world to ever have a second family because.

00:58:43
<transcript>: i'm literally

00:58:45
<transcript>: I'm literally always in my house.

00:58:45
<transcript>: i go

00:58:51

dmmulroy: Gm y'all

00:59:08
<transcript>: I need a new project, Little sammy, because I thought I had one. And then we found out somebody already made it. So I don't need to make it anymore. I've made this site to help choose domains. Ace domains. That's a cool idea. I want to take a look at that.

00:59:17
<transcript>: I'm going to pull it up. Why is my throat so dry.

00:59:23
<transcript>: Why am I so dry? The one you're currently secretly raising with him.

00:59:23
<transcript>: adam can you please

00:59:29
jeroenreumkens: @fredyfumier Mux could also be a nice video / live streaming service you could use. Unsure how it compares to what Cloudflare offers though.

00:59:31
<transcript>: Adam, can you please review the prs that I have to review? It's very tiring. That does sound tiring. No, thank you. I'm going to pass.

00:59:35

00:59:37
<transcript>: Great question.

00:59:37
<transcript>: i do why

00:59:43
<transcript>: I do. Why does it not play? Why does it do that? Why does it go to that camera? Why does it not play music.

00:59:47

01:00:04
<transcript>: it's his dext

01:00:17
<transcript>: It's his dexterity. He's not flexible enough to get over it. Just when he's on the left side, too much of his brain is engaged because he's not. I don't know. I'm trying to make sense of it. Milash coder. Thank you for the follow. I appreciate it so much.

01:00:52

01:01:03
<transcript>: Absolutely humble web Dev the USA Zone thank you for the follow.

01:01:22
thdxr: tevas

01:01:22
<transcript>: And just like you can't stress too much about like avoiding tech debt, because ultimately it's just going to happen either way. And you're going to want to rewrite the whole thing in like five years. So just don't stress too much.

01:01:22
<transcript>: literally every

01:01:32
stroopwafel26: crocs ftw

01:01:33
<transcript>: Literally every friend and I build, I just assume is going to be thrown away. I have never built a front end, and I probably spend more time building front ends than anything. I've never built a front end and been like, oh, I need to make sure.

01:01:36
<transcript>: I get this thing just right.

01:01:42

01:01:42
<transcript>: they're just all throw

01:01:45
pbertrand_dev: if you have tech debt cant you just raise the tech debt ceiling and make the next person worry about it?

01:01:46
jeroenreumkens: @JeroenReumkens Thank you so much for your kind words! And yes, a11y is important. I don't only want to teach people making nice things that don't work in the real world. Unfortunately there's enough channels out there that teach that way. So lot's of potential to do it different!

01:01:56
<transcript>: They're just all throwaway to me now when I'm building back end stuff and infrastructure stuff, I don't think that way. I'm a little more careful. I think about architecture and other big people thoughts. But when I'm building a front end, it's like this is all garbage. It's going to go in the dumpster. I don't care.

01:01:56

<transcript>: Dang. What was that about? Jay? What was the dang? Good morning, madeline's. Here. Well, she was here ten minutes ago. He does the Universal happen before he catches up? Adam, I think you make great day in the life. Software consultant showing things like how you price, how you invoice, how you client your client. Yeah, I should do that. Subcraft. You're right. That'd be very valuable. Quick. Let's talk more. So you never catch up. Love your videos. It's also.

01:02:49
<transcript>: nice

01:02:54
<transcript>: Nice. You always take the time to ensure accessibility in your videos. I do steiner alert.

01:03:00
fredyfumier: @JeroenReumkens I am proficient at ffmpeg and don't need such services, my question was more business than technical. Cloud providers charge ever TCP packet that exits your VMs and I realized that serving video to clients is very expensive (way more than serving JSON, for example)

01:03:11
daglee: So I'm writing my 3rd email parser and I still suck at it. :D

01:03:13
<transcript>: I appreciate that you notice that because it takes a lot of time. I type all those captions. Well, I start with the first pass of AI stuff and then I fixed it, but it takes a lot of fixing. The AI is not so good at text to speech or speech to text. When it comes to technical terms, a lot of it just gets messed up.

01:03:13
<transcript>: anyone

01:03:20
<transcript>: Anyone want a game of knots and crosses while we wait? Someone did that last time. You know what? I'm just going to skip.

01:03:20
<transcript>: can

01:03:22
<transcript>: Can I do it.

01:03:22
<transcript>: can

01:03:34
africanxmamba1: But Adam that uses an OpenAI API key 😭 I definitely thought about using that but the more queries the more it’s gonna cost you know ? Especially if I wanted to launch on my own server

01:03:38
<transcript>: Can I skip everything? I don't think I'm that behind anymore. So, God, I'm not the only one who sucks at coding challenges. Cheers. Adam. Have a great rest of your day. You too. Everyone else knocked my routine at work. Alison, thank you so much for all the ideas. Those are so good. Ard, seven. Seven. Thank you for the follow.

01:03:38
schrew: D: SKIP D: In this economy?

01:03:47
<transcript>: Could someone please tell me why my voice is so dry? Good morning, Dmoroy. Mux. Could also be a nice video live streaming service you could use.

madeleinepatience: Too many of those granola bars?

01:04:07
<transcript>: Dax. I live in Florida. We don't wear shoes. That's awesome. That was a Prime Daxax. Indeed. I tried speaking about clarify. It was like a C plus. Nah, it was worse. Speaking out cloudflare. Did you hear about how the CEO fired all his sales team with disrespect? No. Sounds bad. Adam, if you were a bot, what would you like? Your systems program.

01:04:07
<transcript>: programming language

01:04:10
<transcript>: Programming language to be if you were a bot.

01:04:16
<transcript>: If I was a bot, what would I want? My systems program. I don't even know how to answer that.

01:04:19
<transcript>: Like if I was about what would I want to be written in.

01:04:34
kedemel: JavaScript. LUL

01:04:39
<transcript>: I don't know. I don't have an opinion. I'm sorry. I wish I could think of something clever. You wear crocs, though. There. Right. Tevas. What's? Tevas? Is that like fancy crocs. I wish to start a project. Cheeky trooper. Welcome to Chat. I'm unsure which technologies to use for front and back end. Any recommendations? So Cheeky. Here's the thing.

01:04:42
<transcript>: Do it as I say, not as I do.

01:04:42
<transcript>: there's

01:04:47
<transcript>: There's probably a lot of benefit to building with just the thing that everybody uses.

01:04:47
<transcript>: no you

01:04:49
developmentrobot: @adamdotdev is there any way we can show off some of the stuff we're building and have your opinion on it, is discord the best place for this?

01:04:55
<transcript>: No. You know what? Screw that. That's Twitter. Twitter sucks. Twitter doesn't know anything. Just start with anything that you're comfortable with.

01:04:55
<transcript>: it

01:04:57
<transcript>: It doesn't matter.

01:04:57
<transcript>: there

01:05:07
bishopdev: wow adam, I'm on twitter .. I don't suck and I do know things

01:05:08
<transcript>: There are so many full stack frameworks. You could choose any of those laravel we've been talking a lot about django if you're into python or if you're not sure what language you like and you just need to pick something.

01:05:08
<transcript>: there's so many good

01:05:14
mattmancodes: none of it matters

01:05:16
kedemel: Start in .NET, baby. C#.

01:05:17
thdxr: just unfollow everyone on twitter except me

01:05:19
bishopdev: genuinely offended right now ..

01:05:22
notorioussledge: Rust B)

01:05:25
thdxr: idk why people haven’t realized this

01:05:28
<transcript>: There's so many good options. Rails, there's all these full stack frameworks that are very established. Then if you want to get into the modern stuff, there's nextjs, there's spelt Kit remix. There's just so many options to build a full stack app these days I would build something that's like I wouldn't piecemeal like I wouldn't choose a back end and then just build a front end.

01:05:28
<transcript>: totally separ

01:05:29
kampouse: quickcity?

01:05:32
thdxr: everyone is always wrong except me

01:05:37
<transcript>: Totally separately, I would choose one of the all in one frameworks just so it's easier to not have to think about how to tie the two together. You don't want to waste a lot of time with plumbing.

01:05:37
<transcript>: but

01:05:40
<transcript>: But that's my advice. It really doesn't matter.

01:05:40
<transcript>: it really

01:05:48
kampouse: @thdxr true

01:05:51
<transcript>: It really doesn't. If you have tech debt, can you just raise the tech debt ceiling and make the next person worry about it? There you go. That's what our government does. I think so. Sure. Kind words. Yes. Ally is important.

01:05:51
<transcript>: i don't only want

01:05:55
<transcript>: I don't only want to teach people making nice things that don't work in the real world.

01:05:55
<transcript>: oh

01:05:58
<transcript>: Oh, you weren't talking to me.

01:06:03
<transcript>: Sorry I took the accessibility comment.

01:06:03
<transcript>: as

01:06:04
kedemel: Okay, that "tech debt ceiling" comment was top notch. LOL

01:06:10
pbertrand_dev: @thdxr this is false I watched the roxcodes show yesterday

01:06:11
<transcript>: As a comment to me on my YouTube videos because I do all the captions. That's not what they were talking about. They were talking about front end FY.

01:06:11
<transcript>: okay

01:06:12
<transcript>: Okay.

01:06:19
<transcript>: Now I'm more behind. I keep talking. Let's see. I'm proficient at ffmpeg. Okay, you guys are talking about us.

01:06:19
<transcript>: that's not

01:06:26
lilsammy777: did you start using 100% of laravel (building front end with blade templates etc) or you prefer to build your FE with something like vue/react?

01:06:31
aurindo: I'm trying to create a company (Saas )focused on delivering fast and cheap. Focused on simples solutions to companies. I'm going to use simples vercel infra and of course nextjs for everything

01:06:34
<transcript>: That's not to me. I'm writing my third email parser, and I still suck at it. Email parser? What's an email parser. Adam, that uses an Open api key. Yeah, I definitely thought about using that, but more queries, the more it's going to cost. Yeah, that would be really expensive. I do wonder how that model works.

01:06:37
steinerl: @JeroenReumkens its the little things that make a big difference

01:06:44
thdxr: adam doesn’t use laravel lmao stop asking him about it

01:06:47
<transcript>: Somebody just built a sat me's competitor with that text to sql thing, and it's going to be so much more expensive than our infrastructure cost. That doesn't mean it's not possible. I'm just curious how that works out, because I don't know.

01:06:47
<transcript>: skip

01:06:50
<transcript>: Skip in this economy.

01:06:50
<transcript>: what too

01:06:50
notorioussledge: It's definitely useful of thinking of tech debt as something you manage the same you manage regular debt rather than something that is avoided at all costs

01:06:52
<transcript>: What? Too many of those granola bars.

01:07:02
<transcript>: I'm so behind. Is there any way we can show off some of the stuff we're building and have your opinion on it. Is Discord the best place? Yes. Let's do it in discord development. Robot.

01:07:04
thdxr: ^

01:07:07
<transcript>: It's less ephemeral. It'll last we can have a real conversation about it.

01:07:07
<transcript>: bishop i'm

01:07:11
<transcript>: Bishop, I'm on Twitter. I don't suck, and I do know things.

01:07:11
<transcript>: oh sorry

01:07:17
<transcript>: Oh, sorry. Did I. Did I say everyone on Twitter sucks. I just met Twitter sucks. Not everyone on Twitter.

01:07:30
daglee: @adamdotdev So, parsing emails. Mimes and headers etc.

01:07:32
<transcript>: Let's see. Sarton. Net, baby. C sharp. There you go. Just unfollow. Everyone on Twitter except me. Yeah, DAX is probably the only safe follow. Genuinely offended? Oh, no, wait. Are you genuinely offended? Someone said genuinely offended? Are you seriously.

01:07:32
<transcript>: or just you just

01:07:35
<transcript>: Or just you just messing around with me, Bishop.

01:07:39
<transcript>: You don't suck. I don't think you suck. You know things.

01:07:39
<transcript>: notorious

01:07:46
<transcript>: Notorious ledge rust. Welcome to Chat. I don't know why people haven't realized this quick city. What's that.

01:07:56
<transcript>: Oh, I was almost caught up. Everyone is always wrong. Except me. True. Okay, that tech debt ceiling comment was top notch. This is false. I watched a Rock code show yesterday.

01:07:56
<transcript>: did you start

01:08:01
iamtrulyao: Why do you write F#? How did you even get into it? It feels like one of those languages you'll never really find support for when you are stuck, what's the experience been like?  - Also I did see that new Statmuse competitor, it appears it is making things up somehow

01:08:16
<transcript>: Did you start using 100% of laravel building front end with blade templates, et cetera? Or do you preferred your front end with something like View react. So the inertia versus livewire debate? Not that it's a huge debate that I know anything about. But for me, the debate in my mind was I'm trying to escape Nixjs and all of the React ecosystem. Do I want to use more of that.

01:08:16
<transcript>: but

01:08:26
<transcript>: But get to use larval from my back end. No, I want to go all in. I did the livewire thing so that's my Avenue of exploration.

01:08:26
<transcript>: is

01:08:31
<transcript>: Is build it all with blade templates and live wire and that play with that stuff.

01:08:39
<transcript>: But I'm also not building, like super interactive stuff right now. So my headspace is kind of in that more like a site, not an app thing.

01:08:41
<transcript>: Welcome to chat.

01:08:41
<transcript>: arindo

01:08:50
alexandersix_: Digging into Livewire means that you get to play with all of the fun Filament packages, too. 100% would recommend!

01:08:53
<transcript>: Arindo I'm trying to create a company. Sas focused on delivering fast and cheap. Focus on simple solutions to companies. I'm going to use simpleversal infra and of course, next year is for everything. I think that's totally fine.

01:08:53
<transcript>: i think

01:08:57
<transcript>: I think especially if you're building like B, two B stuff.

01:08:57
<transcript>: versailles

01:09:02
<transcript>: Versailles the free tale will probably always be fine because usage is not that giant.

01:09:02
<transcript>: we built sat

01:09:05
<transcript>: We built Sat News, which is more B to C.

01:09:05
<transcript>: it's like

01:09:09
<transcript>: It's like more to the masses so our scale would be difficult.

01:09:09
<transcript>: to just

01:09:19
<transcript>: To justify paying versailles for what we get like the value trade off just isn't there. But for B two B stuff, I think you'll probably never even notice that you have a versaille account.

01:09:19
<transcript>: okay adam doesn't

01:09:27
<transcript>: Okay. Adam doesn't use larval. Stop asking about it. Sure I do. It's definitely useful if you have tech debt as something. I love this whole laravel thing.

01:09:27
<transcript>: i love

01:09:36
<transcript>: I love how much dax just gets on me about it. And it is kind of funny how many people think I know laravel now? Because I made one tweet about how I just looked at it.

01:09:40
<transcript>: Man is the same manage.

01:09:40
<transcript>: regular debt

01:09:44
<transcript>: Regular debt rather than something that is avoided at all costs.

01:09:44
<transcript>: manage

01:09:54
<transcript>: Manage the same. You manage. Yeah. You take on some like you're going to take on some. Okay. I'm almost caught up. So parsing, emails, mines and headers, et cetera.

01:09:54
<transcript>: oh

01:09:59
<transcript>: Oh, okay. Why are you doing that for a project? Why do you write F. Sharp.

01:09:59
<transcript>: how do you even

01:10:02
pbertrand_dev: !titIe Laravelfluencer/web developer and startup co-founder, AMA

01:10:07
kampouse: adam can you make a laravel crash course of 10hr pls

01:10:11
<transcript>: How do you even get into it? It feels like one of those languages you'll never really find support for when you're stuck. What's the experience been like? Also, I did see that new statute's competitor appears it's making things up somehow.

01:10:29
<transcript>: So I am truly F sharp. Well, Jay, if he's still here, Jay was pretty big in def Sharp, and it's samuel's. Basically, all the technologies we use are because somebody really wanted to use it. And we just kind of like, let engineers use what they want to use. So Jay really knew F sharp and was into it.

01:10:29
<transcript>: i don't think we ever had

01:10:42
thdxr: can you spice up this stream a bit

01:10:45
<transcript>: I don't think we ever had a hard time finding answers to F sharp questions. Maybe just don't get stuck very much with F sharp. It's that functional state of mind. Lannery, thank you so much for the resub prime. Two months. Good morning. Good morning, lannery. Thank you so much.

01:10:45
<transcript>: okay

01:10:52
bigbandzjosh: "Just don't get stuck" I love it LOL

01:10:53
<transcript>: Okay, digging into livewire means that you get to play with all of the Fun filament packages, too. 100% would recommend. Yeah, filament seems really good.

01:10:57
<transcript>: Titled Laravel, laravel.

01:10:57
<transcript>: fluen

01:11:01
<transcript>: Fluencer, Web developer and Startup co founder ama I Love it.

01:11:08
<transcript>: Campus. Adam, can you make a Larvoe crash course of 10 hours, please? Oh, man. Erin should make.

01:11:08
<transcript>: a larave

01:11:10
schrew: Cant get into livewire, because it gives me limewire flashbacks

01:11:11
<transcript>: A laravel crash course.

01:11:15
<transcript>: He'd be in a Lambo this time next month.

01:11:15
<transcript>: aaron needs

01:11:16
<transcript>: Aaron needs to do it.

01:11:16
<transcript>: that

01:11:20
<transcript>: That is a job for Aaron. He would do so good.

01:11:20
<transcript>: he just

01:11:23
<transcript>: He just made that course for my sequel if he can find.

01:11:23
<transcript>: the time

01:11:43
<transcript>: The time, and he's in his maximum effort phase. He's willing to put in the time if he could make a crash course on laravel and sell it for whatever he would do so well, right now, can you spice up the stream a little bit? You bet. Let's do it. Dax, ask me something spicy. Just don't get stuck. I love it. Yeah. Teachers don't get stuck. Just write good.

01:11:43
<transcript>: code

01:11:46
alexandersix_: Dan's (creator of Filament) is an awesome guy, too. Super helpful and responsive. I did a few streams on Filament and he was practically falling over himself to offer tips and tricks 🔥

01:11:46
<transcript>: Code? What's the problem? I don't understand.

01:11:50
<transcript>: Can't get into livewire because it gives me live.

01:11:50
<transcript>: wire fl

01:11:55
<transcript>: Wire. Flashback. Wow. Like Napster and lime wire. You just took me way back.

01:12:04
mehulsharmamat: hey adam hey hey!

01:12:11
thdxr: spice question: why do you think chat is so dumb?

01:12:12
mehulsharmamat: was feeling down today this stream gonna cheer me up

01:12:15
<transcript>: Dan an awesome guy, too. Super, helpful and responsive. I did a few streams on filament, and he was practically falling over himself to offer tips and tricks. That's awesome. Alexander, I found someone on that team. I was on the filament website, okay, and I scroll down. I see their team, and Adam weston is one of them. Do you guys know that weston is middle name like Adam West and elmore? And it was.

01:12:15
<transcript>: adam

01:12:19
alexandersix_: LOL

01:12:22
<transcript>: Adam wesson is one of the filament people, so I had to reach out to him like we're both Adam Weston.

01:12:22
<transcript>: was kind of a little

01:12:28
alexandersix_: I love Adam W! He's awesome.

01:12:35
<transcript>: Was kind of a little different, but kind of males here feeling down today this stream going to cheer me up yes Mayhew I need more Mayhew content that would cheer me up so it's funny we should just hang out. Apparently we would cheer each other up.

01:12:35
<transcript>: spice

01:12:38
<transcript>: Spice question. Why do you think Chad is so dumb? What.

01:12:40
schrew: Namesake of the mythbusters!

01:12:47
<transcript>: Why is Chat done? What? Psi. Berry, thank you for the follow. What do you mean, dax? You mean from that thing on rockstar Stream yesterday.

01:12:48
alexandersix_: @thdxr LUL

01:12:52
mehulsharmamat: im working on an AWS video and i think dax and me are gonna be enemies now

01:12:53
<transcript>: You know, Adam weston, isn't that awesome.

01:12:53
<transcript>: like

01:12:59
thdxr: i don’t think chat is dumb, i’m asking why you think this chat is dumb

01:13:01
<transcript>: Like we have the same name, kind of. We're kind of. Aws video. I think dax and me are going to be enemies now. Oh, boy. Oh, I'm excited for this one.

01:13:04
notorioussledge: Prefer Smith & Weston ngl

01:13:07
<transcript>: I don't think Chad is dumb. I'm asking why you think Chad is dumb? Oh, this Chad is dump. I don't think this Chad is done. What are you talking about.

01:13:07
<transcript>: for

01:13:09
thdxr: @mehulsharmamat imma end you

01:13:09
pbertrand_dev: wait adam thinks chat is dumb?

01:13:10
alexandersix_: So now I know TWO Adam Westons. Time to start a collection

01:13:10
<transcript>: For Smith and wesson not going to lie.

01:13:11
pbertrand_dev: why?

01:13:16
<transcript>: Why would I think Chad is dumb? I don't think Chad is dumb. Stop bertrand. I know where this is headed.

01:13:16
<transcript>: this is

01:13:19
<transcript>: This is a collaborative troll if I've ever seen one.

01:13:24
mehulsharmamat: @thdxr youre probably right but i gotta do it and you know it

01:13:27
sockthedev: wat wat wat!

01:13:29
thdxr: remember the other day when you were like “i hate my twitch chat they’re so dumb “

01:13:37
thdxr: before our podcast

01:13:39
<transcript>: Now I know two Adam westons exactly. Some sort of collection. That's funny. Did anybody ever like, do you have another person out there in the world that has your exact name? And anytime you Google yourself, you're reminded there's this other person out there that has done things on the Internet, and they have your exact same name, because there's another Adam elmer out there. He's like an investor. And it's funny, just.

01:13:45
<transcript>: To kind of look at our Google results every once in a while and be reminded like, oh, how are you doing? Adam.

01:13:50
<transcript>: Probably right. But I got to do it. And you know, it.

01:13:52
pbertrand_dev: that seems like a classic adam thing to say

01:13:53
alexandersix_: I don't sadly. Six isn't a super common last name 😂

01:13:54
stroopwafel26: @notorioussledge i had to google this

01:13:57
zamlond: Hey Guys, I have a FB friend for years just because of our names

01:13:58
<transcript>: What's the video about? Mayhew. Let's get spicy. Mr. Space otter. Mrs. No, Mr. Space otter. Thank you for that. Follow.

01:14:02
mehulsharmamat: AWS rant

01:14:02
<transcript>: Remember the other day when you were like, I hate my twitch chat. They're so dumb.

01:14:06
mehulsharmamat: just general AWS experience

01:14:06
chrispian: The only person I've ever seen with my name is my nephew.

01:14:07
<transcript>: Before podcast. I did not say that.

01:14:14
alexandersix_: Someone clip that

01:14:15
andreaslorozco: I just heard it

01:14:17
<transcript>: I did not say that. I did just now say it. So please don't clip that. But I did not say that before our straight or before our podcast.

01:14:17
<transcript>: you're lying

01:14:19
sockthedev: does twitch give refunds on subscriptions?

01:14:19
thdxr: CLIP IT

01:14:20
<transcript>: You're lying, dax. It's just a lie.

01:14:20
<transcript>: six isn't

01:14:26
<transcript>: Six isn't a super common last name. Oh, yeah. I guess it wouldn't be. Is that actually your last name? Like birth certificate.

01:14:26
<transcript>: six

01:14:27
<transcript>: Six.

01:14:30
<transcript>: Alexander Six. I've never seen that last name.

01:14:30
<transcript>: i thought

01:14:33
alexandersix_: Yep! Legal last name, born with it

01:14:36
mehulsharmamat: @alexandersix_ i envy you

01:14:39
kampouse: @thdxr not nice

01:14:42
<transcript>: I thought it was just like a name you took on, like a stage name for Twitter or something. Welcome to Chat zamlon. Hey, guys, I have a Facebook friend for years, just because of our names. Really like, same name. So you guys reached out. That's awesome.

01:14:43
dmmulroy: Nikki Sixx

01:14:45
mattmancodes: Has Ken Wheeler made a remix of the epic clip?

01:14:47
alexandersix_: I'm definitely not cool enough to have a stage name lol

01:14:48
thdxr: @mehulsharmamat if you do that you’ll never make it

01:14:50
stroopwafel26: i'm waiting for alexander seven to drop

01:14:52
<transcript>: Aws rant, just general AWS experience. I love it. I can't wait for it. Mayhol I love your videos? The only person I've ever seen with my name is my nephew.

01:14:56

And I thought of your video and like, oh, I should reach out to Mayhewool. Maybe he's already got the voices, and I could just use them.

01:15:22

mrspaceotter: If its about the sponsor controversy... idk why people get it wrong.

01:15:23
jaystation3x: F# choice was driven by a few things. (1) MVP was in C#, so the .NET compatibility was valuable. (2) powerful, readable pattern-matching capability worked really well for the NLP use case. (3) pipeline-oriented functional patterns map very nicely to an NLP pipeline. (4) immutable data structures great workflows where we try multiple pathways in parallel and select the best result.

01:15:29
mehulsharmamat: @thdxr wdym wont make it. but for real i loved AWS thing, it's just trying to be funny with it (and failing)

mehulsharmamat: dont test me i can

01:16:35
<transcript>: One MVP was in C sharp. So the net compatibility is valuable. Two powerful readable pattern matching capability worked really well for the nlp use case it does. Three pipeline oriented functional patterns map very nicely to an nlp pipeline for immutable data structures. Great workflows where we try multiple pathways in parallel and select the best result. There you go. There's a lot more.

01:16:35

01:17:52
techdufus: quick, make him behind on chat again

01:17:57
kryotoboi: Wow Adam hasn't heard of Motley Crue

01:17:58
<transcript>: Too far. Never heard of Motley crue smh. The epic clip equals the one where you read out the username, which was inappropriate. Oh, yeah, that one was not good. I'm sure that's what bertrand just clipped. Thank you, bertrand. I appreciate it. I appreciate you bringing that into the forefront.

01:18:03

thdxr: i already downloaded the video

01:18:23
kryotoboi: Motley crue is a way of life

01:18:27
<transcript>: Mr. Space on our sub. Transparency is King. Every other industry had has the problem and tried to tackle it. So here's the thing. It's not any one person's fault. Well, it is one person's fault. It's my fault. And that's not just me trying to take responsibility. I really should have had more examples in the clerk example. It wasn't fair to clerk. It wasn't fair to.

01:18:27
<transcript>: anybody involved

01:18:31
dmmulroy: this entire chat is a motley crue

01:18:32
<transcript>: Anybody involved. Then I literally gave one example for what I think is a broad problem.

01:18:32
<transcript>: that

01:18:41
notorioussledge: Kickstart my heart

01:18:52
<transcript>: That is only tangentially related to clerk. And the example I gave. Still, I should have given more examples. I don't know what I was thinking. Here's the thing. When I record videos, the last few of them, I just turn on the camera and I start talking. I don't plan it ahead of time. If I had written out points, I would have been like, oh, looking at this outline, I can't just have one example. That's dumb, but I didn't. I just.

01:18:52
<transcript>: started talking

01:18:55
mehulsharmamat: i think anti-devrel should exist

01:19:02
<transcript>: Started talking. And that's what all came out. It was the thing that was most recent on my mind. And that's where we landed. That was a mistake. Shouldn't have done it. Nobody else's fault. It's just my fault. I should have done better.

01:19:09
<transcript>: Diamor. I listened to kickstart My Heart by Motley crue. So this is music. Okay. Maybe I will. Maybe.

01:19:09
<transcript>: tech doova

01:19:10
tayloreddev: people should stop being so sensitive video was fine in my opinion

01:19:13
kampouse: blame adam

01:19:14
thdxr: that’s me i’m anti devrel

01:19:17
mehulsharmamat: @TayloredDev yeah exactly.

01:19:21
thdxr: i keep correcting the chaos devrel creates

01:19:26
kampouse: @thdxr only need real dev

01:19:29
<transcript>: Tech doova's. Quick, mate him behind on chat again. Oh, no. Make him. No. Adam hasn't heard of Motley crue. Why is Motley crue famous? What's a Motley crew. I already downloaded the video. Mostly Motley crue is a way of life. Wow. What is it? It's entire chat is Motley crue kickstart my heart. I think antidevarrel should exist.

01:19:33
<transcript>: People should stop being so sensitive. Video is fine in my opinion.

01:19:37
zguiba: Do you think we always should try to create something innovative? Is it okay to create something that already exists but better?

01:19:42
<transcript>: I'm caught up.

01:19:59
<transcript>: I think I will do another video about Deborah.

01:20:04
<transcript>: It's interesting when you follow enough people on Twitter.

01:20:09
sinicaldev: The segment of terminally online developers on Twitter is pretty cringe all round, Twitter won't let me escape the algorithm though

01:20:09
<transcript>: That literally every day, someone's getting on a plane to go to some conference.

01:20:09
stroopwafel26: @zGuiba isn't this what apple does

01:20:11
mehulsharmamat: dax is the anti devrel not the world needs, but it deserves

01:20:15
mehulsharmamat: and i dont want to be in that world anymore

01:20:15
dmmulroy: Watch 'The Dirt' on Netflix. It's Motley Crue's story, it's v. good

01:20:15
<transcript>: To speak, and they all have avocados in their name. I don't know. It feels like a bubble.

01:20:15
notorioussledge: That's fair, I didn't think the video was too bad, I get why maybe some people felt singled out though.

01:20:19
<transcript>: Just feels bad.

01:20:27
<transcript>: Do you think we always should try to create something innovative.

01:20:27
<transcript>: is it okay

01:20:28
alexandersix_: Avocado === DevRel?

01:20:30
<transcript>: Is it okay to create something that already exists, but better.

01:20:30
<transcript>: so

01:20:32
<transcript>: So guiba I know a lot of people.

01:20:32
<transcript>: say

01:20:34
thdxr: lol we make fun of the avocados so much

01:20:37
<transcript>: Say it's better to build something where it already exists, because you know that there's a market.

01:20:37
dmmulroy: Dev Rel is a 0% interest rate phenomenon

01:20:44
<transcript>: My only experience was building stat muse, which was a totally new thing that didn't exist.

01:20:49
<transcript>: I think it can work out either way. The odds are probably better.

01:21:00
<transcript>: Building something that competes with something that already exists because you know, at least there are some people willing to pay for this. If you can out execute them or build some features they don't have or something.

01:21:02
mattmancodes: I hated that avocado thing... what were they thinking?

01:21:04
<transcript>: That's probably safer. Bet.

01:21:06
stroopwafel26: @thdxr anyone with an avocado in their linkedin profile is cringe

01:21:11
<transcript>: A segment of terminally online developers on Twitter is pretty cringe all round. Twitter don't want me to escape the algorithm though.

01:21:11
<transcript>: i'm doing

mehulsharmamat: fr i have never have had an avadacado

01:21:13
kampouse: @dmmulroy how to hype tech oriented to dev

01:21:14
<transcript>: I'm doing a video about Twitter.

01:21:18
<transcript>: It's going to be very dramatic. I'm very excited.

01:21:22
thdxr: adam just outed himself as never reading zero to one how can he claim to be a startup founder

01:21:25
<transcript>: Dax is the antidevrel, not the world needs, but it deserves.

01:21:29
<transcript>: I don't want to be in that world anymore.

01:21:30
sinicaldev: Doing something better is innovation. See the calendar startups worth billions atm

01:21:30

01:21:30
<transcript>: watch the

01:21:39
chrispian: If I ever murder anyone it'll because I can hear them chew ;)

01:21:45
<transcript>: Watch The Dirt on Netflix. It's Motley Cruz story. It's very good. Okay. I will. Well, maybe I'll be honest. I don't watch much on Netflix. That's fair. I didn't think the video was too bad. I get why maybe some people felt singled out, though. Yeah. I don't want people to feel singled out.

01:21:45
mehulsharmamat: OH do that video then im gonna steal that idea because YES THERE SHOULD BE A VIDEO on tech twitter

01:21:51
<transcript>: Avocado equals devrell it's developer advocate. They'll put avocados in their name.

01:21:51
mrspaceotter: Adam aka. DevRelpool

01:21:53
<transcript>: I don't know.

01:21:58
alexandersix_: That's so bizarre

01:21:59
<transcript>: You ain't better than the avocado. So much Devrell is a 0% interest rate phenomenon. Honestly.

01:21:59
<transcript>: i think

01:22:08
<transcript>: I think so. And not like just trying to jab at it. I just think like the state of Devrell is 100% a 0% interest rate phenomenon.

01:22:08
<transcript>: whether there

01:22:11
caasidev: hey Adam

01:22:13
<transcript>: Whether there should be any. I'm not saying there shouldn't be any. I think education is great.

01:22:24
mehulsharmamat: im the devrel @ statmuse guys AMA

01:22:25
<transcript>: But the size of the Devrell industry is just a product to me, of lots of capital. There's been a lot of free money for a decade.

01:22:29
<transcript>: And tech companies had a lot of cash. And there you go.

01:22:32
<transcript>: Coromatch. Thank you for the follow.

01:22:34
thdxr: someone told me SST will fail without a devrel team

01:22:41
mehulsharmamat: a. yes we're selling your data to google

01:22:42
<transcript>: Anyone with an avocado and their LinkedIn profiles cringe. For real. I have never had an avocado. You've never eaten an avocado. Mayhew. What.

01:22:42
<transcript>: are you saying you're

01:22:46
<transcript>: Are you saying you're never eating one? You've never eaten an avocado because you need to.

01:22:46
<transcript>: how to

01:22:48
<transcript>: How to hype tech oriented to Dev.

01:22:53
<transcript>: Like, how do you do it.

01:22:55
<transcript>: If not with Deborah.

01:23:00
<transcript>: So I'm going to say some things.

01:23:05
kampouse: @thdxr you looking for devrel for SST?

01:23:05
mehulsharmamat: never had an avadacado, not sure where to find them (i dont think my city would have it?)

01:23:09
<transcript>: Trying to think if I'm going to be singling anybody out no, I'll say the positive like Planet Scale. I think they do devereaux. Excellently.

01:23:09
<transcript>: and not just because

01:23:11
iamameatpopscicle: @mehulsharmamat have you at least heard of Motley Crue?

01:23:12
<transcript>: And not just because Aaron Francis, I consider.

01:23:12
<transcript>: i'm friend

01:23:26
themrsacs: Probably call themselves Devrel as devpimp is probably not socially acceptable

01:23:32
<transcript>: I'm friendly with Aaron. I'm careful to call people friends now, because that's been used against me. I'm friendly with a lot of people. Okay? I would call me and Aaron on the path to friendship. Still early. Still never met him in person. I'm kind of a boomer. I like to meet people in person, but I would say we're on the path of friendship. Okay, that's not why I think Planet Skill is doing a.

01:23:32
<transcript>: job i think

01:23:34
<transcript>: Job. I think plant skill.

01:23:34
<transcript>: a

juniornascm: Good morning

01:23:49
mehulsharmamat: @mehulsharmamat no but im v impressed how you came up with a music band in the conversation of avadacado

01:23:54
<transcript>: Aaron making that course and giving away a huge, valuable thing to the community. Teaching MySQL no less. It's not teaching how to use plant scale. It's teaching like the underlying concepts and then people discovering planets going be like I'd rather just run out on plant skill. I think that's good debris and it's not up to me. I'm not the arbiter of what is good and bad. Devrell. I could be totally wrong.

01:23:59
<transcript>: I think anytime debris is about educating people.

01:24:01
<transcript>: I think.

01:24:01
<transcript>: that's probably best

01:24:03
<transcript>: That's probably best.

01:24:31
<transcript>: His head's already growing, but I think he does a really good job with deborah at sst. I think sst is doing really well and they figured out how to just be mean on the Internet and troll people and get people to use your stuff. That's not all they're doing. November thank you for the follow Adam just out of himself as never reading zero to one. How can he claim to be a start offender.

01:24:31

01:24:39
<transcript>: doing something

01:24:46
<transcript>: Doing something better is innovation. See the calendar startups worth billions at the moment. If I ever murder anyone, it'll be because I can hear them too.

01:24:46
<transcript>: oh no

01:24:53
<transcript>: Oh, no, crispy. And I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I was chewing into the mic. I have a very sensitive mic. Do that video, then.

01:24:58
<transcript>: I'm going to do that. Where'd it go? Do that video again.

01:24:58
chrispian: lol

01:25:00
<transcript>: I lost it.

01:25:17
<transcript>: Do that video. Am I behind on chat again? Do that video again. Video. Then I'm going to steal that idea because, yes, there should be a video on tech Twitter. Oh, no, Mayhool is going to do it better than me. That's okay. I'm going to do mine. I'm going to try and do it today. Tomorrow. Tech savage, thank you so much for the follow.

01:25:32
<transcript>: I don't know if it's going to be good, but it's going to feel good. It's going to feel good to make it. Adam aka dev ruel Pool. What's that? It's so bizarre. Hey, Adam. Cassie's here. I'm the deborah Stapm news, guys. Ama, someone told me the ssd will fail without a devil team. That's funny.

01:25:32
<transcript>: yes

01:25:33
mehulsharmamat: dax is devrel boss

01:25:35
<transcript>: Yes. We're selling your data to Google.

01:25:43
<transcript>: Funny. Looking for deborah for sst. I never had an avocado. Not sure where to find them. I don't think my city would have it. Really.

<transcript>: And you can probably just stick with that currently working. Let me read again for eight months. You already got eight months experience only learn react to my free learning time. So the longer you're in this career, the more you'll realize.

01:27:36
<transcript>: I don't know how much it matters, how long you've spent with certain frameworks.

01:27:39
<transcript>: I think I learned best.

01:27:39
<transcript>: not just

01:27:45
<transcript>: Not just arbitrarily going out and trying to learn something. If you're going to learn react do it because you have a reason. I.

01:27:45
<transcript>: 'm getting

01:28:04
<transcript>: 'm getting paid like your company. They have a React project or another company that you're going to work for and you can learn on that code base. It's just way easier than like I'm going to go watch some videos and learn React, so don't go out of your way to learn react. Try and learn it if you want to in a setting where you're getting paid or you otherwise have a good reason to learn it.

thdxr: kevin not him

01:35:44
<transcript>: And instead of doing a rack, this time we did something called an oxfit. It's electric. Or it's like digital weight or whatever. So it's like a machine that you can do basically everything. I liked it because.

01:35:44
<transcript>: you can do basic

01:35:48
thdxr: @stroopwafel26 lolol

01:35:51
<transcript>: You can do basic barbell stuff, but also like rows. I wanted something to do some cardio that was a little more involved than just like running.

01:35:51
<transcript>: yeah anyway

01:35:59
<transcript>: Yeah. Anyway, I hope this last stream never ends. It'll never end well. It will here. In a few minutes. We're going to raid back, but it's not my last stream.

01:35:59
<transcript>: i think

01:36:11
schrew: every time I think of dax, my hair falls out Kappa

<transcript>: I think Adam once told me to work out on dax's Stream. Might try work out with Wait. Told me to work out with the axis. Stream. Might try. There you go. Super cool. Jealous about that? You met him? Yeah. We got to spend some time with a bunch of those people. I have a really good Kevin Mayer story. Kevin Mayer.

01:36:20
kampouse: @stroopwafel26 that a good one

01:36:25
mehulsharmamat: lmao @Schrew

01:36:29
<transcript>: He ended up going to TikTok to be the CEO of TikTok. But he was the guy who acquired Marvel, the guy who acquired Lucas Films or all the George Lucas stuff.

01:36:29
<transcript>: he's the guy

01:36:35
<transcript>: He's the guy that buys company companies at Disney. And he did all those huge mega deals.

01:36:35
<transcript>: so he's

01:36:39
<transcript>: So he's just a really interesting person to talk with because.

01:36:39
<transcript>: he's the guy

01:36:42
<transcript>: He's the guy that's been behind this huge Disney expansion.

01:36:45
<transcript>: And.

01:36:52
<transcript>: We got to go. Okay. So I'm going to tell this story and this quick story. And then we got to get on daxy stream to record a podcast.

01:37:06
<transcript>: Disney led our Series A. Ryan Craig Martin, thank you for the follow. Disney led our Series A. Our $10 million Series A. So they were big investor in statues. We were part of the Disney accelerator.

01:37:26
<transcript>: We had a lot of close ties with Disney. We were building stuff for ESPN. We had, like a deal with ESPN. At one point had all these relationships. And eventually, naturally, when companies, when strategic companies or when strategic investors invest in startups, they always are thinking about acquiring them as well. That's just like a rule of thumb. If you get an investment from a non venture capital.

01:37:26
<transcript>: capitalist like

01:37:29
<transcript>: Capitalist like an actual Corporation.

01:37:29
<transcript>: they probably also

01:37:32
<transcript>: They probably also want to acquire you. It's just natural.

01:37:32
<transcript>: so

01:37:51
<transcript>: So there were a few times that Disney almost acquired stat muse. And one of the times we were really at, like, a high in terms of just things going really well. And we get invited to meet with Kevin Mayer. We know who Kevin Mayer is. We got to meet him at the accelerator, but we know he's the guy that acquires, right? You don't get a meeting with Kevin Mayer.

01:37:51
<transcript>: he was basically

01:38:09
<transcript>: He was basically the second in command behind Bob iger at the time. So he's like, very high up there, right at Disney. And, you know, if you're meeting with him, you kind of know, like they want to acquire. So we have this meeting in Disney. The campus in glendale is kind of huge and sprawling.

01:38:09
<transcript>: but

01:38:12
<transcript>: But they have this one building where all the executives are and.

01:38:12
<transcript>: it's this building

01:38:22
<transcript>: It's this building. I'm not going to describe where in La, because who cares? Nobody even knows what I'm talking about. But it's like this giant, Greek looking building, a lot of pillars and stuff. But it's got.

01:38:22
<transcript>: all the

01:38:37
<transcript>: All the dwarves at the top, like holding up the roof. It's really cool. Just a really cool looking building, like from an architectural standpoint. But then you get to the top where kevin's? Well, kevin's office was right below Bob agar. So it's the second floor from the top.

01:38:37
<transcript>: in the waiting

01:38:41
<transcript>: In the waiting room to go into his office. Was this.

01:38:41
<transcript>: incredible

01:38:42
<transcript>: Incredible.

01:38:42
<transcript>: museum

01:38:45
<transcript>: Museum of Old Snow White paintings.

01:38:45
<transcript>: and

01:38:49
<transcript>: And it was so just amazing to walk into this room.

01:38:49
<transcript>: like you

01:38:52
<transcript>: Like you can just tell these things are very old.

01:38:52
<transcript>: and very exp

01:39:01
<transcript>: And very expensive or something. And it's just the ambience of low lighting. But they were all kind of lit. It was just really cool. So that was a cool experience that I wish.

01:39:01
<transcript>: i could

01:39:05
<transcript>: I could take in pictures or something, and maybe it's on the Internet. I don't know.

01:39:05
<transcript>: so

01:39:16
<transcript>: So we go into Kevin damer's office. And he has all these pillows on the couch. There's like a Marvel pillow. And a Maker Studios, which is like another startup they acquired.

01:39:25
jeroenreumkens: Sounds like this on its own is already a great YouTube vid! Hanging on your lips!

01:39:26
<transcript>: I can't remember if there's a George lucasfilm there's, like, all these pillows of companies that Disney has acquired, and he picks one up. And he's like, I'd like to get a stat muse pillow.

01:39:31
<transcript>: It was such easy, but it just kind of broke the ice that obviously we're here to talk about.

01:39:31
<transcript>: buying

01:39:40
<transcript>: Buying stat muse. And then we did some things that I regret, like telling him we wouldn't sell for less than 100 million.

01:39:40
<transcript>: anyway

01:39:44
<transcript>: Anyway, we didn't get acquired sprungless. Thanks so much for that. Follow.

01:39:44
<transcript>: i think once

01:39:58
<transcript>: I think once Ann told me, work it out and then. Okay, I saw that. Wait. Youtube. Youtube person? Yes. Ten times. Didn't Rose name? Yes. Kevin is a youtuber. Kevin is the best. I got to meet Kevin. We had a little call. I don't know if he's still here.

13:47:03
<transcript>: Hi, DAX.

13:47:03
<transcript>: how are you

13:47:04
<transcript>: How are you.

13:47:09
<transcript>: Hey, dax, what's going on.

13:47:12
<transcript>: What.

13:47:12
<transcript>: i'm too

13:47:14
<transcript>: I'm too loud.

13:47:30
<transcript>: I didn't look at the bars. Can you talk again on Riverside.

13:47:38
<transcript>: I mean, just keep talking. Yeah. Yours is always lower on riverside. I don't know if it matters.

13:47:55
<transcript>: This is good. I like it.

13:48:01
<transcript>: Yeah, just like that. I mean, now.

13:48:01
<transcript>: it's

13:48:06
<transcript>: It's all into the tech community. You just set it on your stream.

13:48:10
<transcript>: Behind you.

13:48:17
<transcript>: Oh no.

13:48:29
<transcript>: So did you you got it this time though you said you're wearing headphones.

13:48:38
<transcript>: Yeah, I never use any of the built in, like audio cleanup features that anything has.

13:48:46
<transcript>: 22 Episode 22.

13:48:50
<transcript>: Look at this. Do you want to record? Like.

13:49:01
<transcript>: Extra ones this week. So that yeah. Because even if we're gone next week, some could roll out next week, but also we could already have them.

13:49:01
<transcript>: we'd have to record

13:49:05
<transcript>: We'd have to record a lot of them, never mind. So that the next week.

13:49:05
<transcript>: we don't have to do you

13:49:07
<transcript>: We don't have to. Do you know what I'm saying.

13:49:10
<transcript>: If we do double this week.

13:49:10
<transcript>: then

13:49:11
<transcript>: Then.

13:49:11
<transcript>: yeah

13:49:13
<transcript>: Yeah.

13:49:17
<transcript>: Let's do it.

13:49:17
<transcript>: well this time

13:49:20
<transcript>: Well, this time. Box. This first one. We won't let it go too long.

13:49:27
<transcript>: We haven't talked about anything, have we.

13:49:36
<transcript>: Sorry, that was a terrible sentence. I mean, we haven't discussed any ideas for podcast episodes, right.

13:49:43
<transcript>: Yes.

13:49:48
<transcript>: Okay, love it okay.

13:49:57
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. Let's see. I'm going to hit record. We got to get one done, and then we'll do a second. Well, are we going to do two free form on Tuesday.

13:49:57
<transcript>: double free

13:50:00
<transcript>: Double free form Tuesday.

13:50:02
<transcript>: Okay.

13:50:07
<transcript>: I love how.

13:50:07
<transcript>: chris i'm going to

13:50:18
<transcript>: Chris, I'm going to say some meta things here. Sorry I already hit record, but you can ignore all this. I just love how Chris will find anything in the middle. It takes all the pressure off. Like just don't have to think at all about how we start it so good.

13:50:20
<transcript>: Yeah.

13:50:27
<transcript>: It's a great approach.

13:50:32
<transcript>: All right. What's been going on, dex? I feel like it's.

13:50:32
<transcript>: been

13:50:34
<transcript>: Been a year since we spoke last.

13:50:55
<transcript>: I would not. I would not like to talk about it. I made mistakes, okay? I made mistakes on the Internet, and I'm paying for my mistakes. That's all.

13:51:07
<transcript>: Seems like it would work. That would work out well.

13:51:17
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah. I guess for people who listen to the podcast, there was just a little controversy. I'm not going to go into it.

13:51:17
<transcript>: a little controvers

13:51:23
<transcript>: A little controversy over some YouTube videos I made, and I might quit YouTube forever, but that's all no big deal.

13:51:26
<transcript>: No YouTube's fun.

13:51:26
<transcript>: it

13:51:32
<transcript>: It's so hard to think of. I mean, you do YouTube. It's so hard to think of video ideas. I hate it. I hate that part.

13:51:46
<transcript>: Yeah.

13:51:53
<transcript>: I've been telling some stories. What's that.

13:51:53
<transcript>: i

13:51:59
<transcript>: I was just going to say, I've been telling stories. I've been doing more videos that are just like, hey, here's things I learned.

13:51:59
<transcript>: in my

13:52:01
<transcript>: In my years.

13:52:01
<transcript>: at stat

13:52:04
<transcript>: At stat, muse, and just in my career and.

13:52:06
<transcript>: I feel like I've only got so many stories.

13:52:06
<transcript>: i've got

13:52:09
<transcript>: I've got to live more life, or I'm going to run out real fast.

13:52:17
<transcript>: Yeah. Exactly. It's so funny. Like every time I consume anything now we just do so little.

13:52:17
<transcript>: just this season

13:52:23
<transcript>: Just this season of Life. The kids are young. Our entire life is just making sure they're good.

13:52:36
<transcript>: But we just have no time for watching stuff or consuming any kind of media. But whenever I do, we let the boys watch part of the lego Movie. The other day, my three year old still never really set to a movie.

13:52:43
<transcript>: My eight year old watched the whole thing later, but the three old just can't sit there long enough.

13:52:43
<transcript>: he gets ant

13:52:46
<transcript>: He gets antsy after like 30 minutes.

13:52:56
<transcript>: So we let him watch part of the lego movie. And I just watched some of it with him and realized, like, oh, there's so much good humor and stuff like this. And you watch it and you just get ideas for things.

13:52:56
<transcript>: if you don't consume

13:53:02
<transcript>: If you don't consume any media, it's really hard to make interesting content, which is why nothing I make is interesting.

13:53:08
<transcript>: Exactly.

13:53:08
<transcript>: there's no

13:53:11
<transcript>: There's no ties to the current culture at all.

13:53:15
<transcript>: In all seriousness. Sorry. I will say this.

13:53:23
<transcript>: I realized with this controversy over I had a video that I took down. It was my fault. I wanted to say that on my podcast as well.

13:53:23
<transcript>: i shouldn't have

13:53:25
<transcript>: I shouldn't have singled out one company, one situation.

13:53:25
<transcript>: not fair to

13:53:29
<transcript>: Not fair to anybody involved. And I did. And I took the video down.

13:53:35
<transcript>: But there is summarized. Oh, yeah. So what I realized with this whole.

13:53:35
<transcript>: disagree

13:53:38
<transcript>: Disagreement that I had with this person.

13:53:41
<transcript>: It really was a lot of it. I think generational.

13:53:41
<transcript>: like

13:53:54
<transcript>: Like as the person explained where they were coming from. As I thought where I'm coming from, there's just a lot of misconceptions or a lot of things that I thought about the situation wrong, because I was thinking from my perspective.

13:53:54
<transcript>: in my

13:53:56
<transcript>: In my age bracket.

13:53:56
<transcript>: and the way

13:53:58
<transcript>: And the way they view certain things.

13:54:05
<transcript>: Were just very different being younger than me. So I realized there really is something to that we're all interacting on the internet.

13:54:14
<transcript>: I just assume everybody's in their thirty s. I don't know, but we're all different backgrounds, different places, different ages. And it makes it hard.

13:54:14
<transcript>: to do stuff

13:54:16
<transcript>: To do stuff together on the internet.

13:55:01
<transcript>: Yeah.

13:55:23
<transcript>: You think, like, Passionary students wouldn't have had that, like before the internet. There's no way they were picking up on that stuff. So it's this weird. It does kind of blur the lines. I guess maybe between, like, the cultures aren't so different. If you're just extremely online, you have a pretty similar.

13:55:23
<transcript>: understanding

13:55:24
<transcript>: Understanding of the world.

13:55:34
<transcript>: Yeah, there is a difference here's a question I'll pose to you.

13:55:34
<transcript>: we can kind of talk about

13:55:41
<transcript>: We can kind of talk about some of this stuff that I learned without directly going into specifics. How many friends do you think you have? Dax.

13:55:44
<transcript>: Like in the world.

13:55:44
<transcript>: online not

13:55:46
<transcript>: Online. Not online. A handful.

13:55:46
<transcript>: okay

13:55:47
<transcript>: Okay.

13:55:47
<transcript>: yeah

13:55:49
<transcript>: Yeah, same.

13:55:54
<transcript>: Yeah.

13:56:09
<transcript>: That night.

13:56:09
<transcript>: nightfield

13:56:19
<transcript>: Nightfield. I mean, I think part of this whole conversation was realizing that I think younger people, I don't want to generalize here or put anybody in a box.

13:56:19
<transcript>: but

13:56:29
<transcript>: But I think they view online relationships are much more like friendships to them than maybe we view them. Does that make sense.

13:56:39
<transcript>: Yeah.

13:57:32
<transcript>: And I guess like I think about the distinction if we had not spent that week at reinvent, I don't know that that really changes our friendship that much. I think.

13:57:32
<transcript>: it's the time we

13:57:38
<transcript>: It's the time we spend together. That makes to me friendships. If I've just kind of.

13:57:38
<transcript>: like existed

13:57:42
<transcript>: Like existed on Twitter with people. I don't consider them friends.

13:57:42
<transcript>: i think

13:57:52
<transcript>: I think some of them I would love to become friends with, but there's more time involved than just like we're hanging out online in public, in a public forum.

13:58:01
<transcript>: Yeah.

13:58:03
<transcript>: That's it, that's it.

13:58:13
<transcript>: We're those people already. It's so funny how quickly.

13:58:13
<transcript>: you become the

13:58:17
<transcript>: You become the people you would have teased years ago.

13:58:17
<transcript>: what's

13:58:19
<transcript>: What's? That.

13:58:26
<transcript>: Yeah. We live on a street that has a bunch of kids.

13:58:26
<transcript>: our

13:58:30
<transcript>: Our neighborhood in general is mostly young families, but our Street.

13:58:31
<transcript>: It's like four.

13:58:38
<transcript>: Houses in a row, five houses in a row where everyone has kids around the same age. So they all just play in each other's backyards.

13:58:38
<transcript>: we kind of have one

13:58:43
<transcript>: We kind of have one seamless, big backyard, and they're always playing out there together. So, Yeah.

13:58:43
<transcript>: i think

13:58:49
<transcript>: I think like my oldest. He's eight. He's got friends just here in the neighborhood. That's basically it, though. I mean.

13:58:49
<transcript>: he's not been out

13:58:54
<transcript>: He's not been out into like he's not in school. He's home schooled.

13:58:54
<transcript>: yeah

13:59:02
<transcript>: Yeah. So that's basically it's just our neighbors and the three year old. I mean, he's friends with them. I don't know. Whatever that means. When you're three.

13:59:07
<transcript>: They're his friends too he's just the littlest of the group so it's different.

13:59:24
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. I mean, we this is the first time we've had it.

13:59:27
<transcript>: We've lived a few places since.

13:59:27
<transcript>: we had our now

13:59:32
<transcript>: We had our now eight year old, and he's never had this before. So it's been really great.

13:59:35
<transcript>: We've lived in other neighborhoods, where it was more older people.

13:59:35
<transcript>: or more

13:59:38
<transcript>: Or more, just not families.

13:59:38
<transcript>: it's

13:59:39
<transcript>: It's.

13:59:39
<transcript>: probably rare

13:59:42
<transcript>: Probably rare. I don't know. We love it, though.

13:59:52
<transcript>: Yeah.

13:59:52
<transcript>: i remember seeing

13:59:56
<transcript>: I remember seeing those charts. Like how little people.

13:59:56
<transcript>: like

13:59:57
<transcript>: Like little people have team.

13:59:57
<transcript>: teamagers

14:00:10
<transcript>: Teamagers how little they spend together, like they spend more of their time hanging out online than past generations. And it makes sense. Like if we were teenagers growing up right now, I'm sure we'd be in the same camp. Like you said, we did the game.

14:00:12
<transcript>: I mean, that was online.

14:00:25
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:00:38
<transcript>: I mean, it does here on this street, the kids ride their bikes around and.

14:00:38
<transcript>: it's a lot of

14:00:41
<transcript>: It's a lot of like whose house are they at today.

14:00:45
<transcript>: Which I really like that for them.

14:00:50
<transcript>: Okay. Are we done talking about this.

14:00:58
<transcript>: What's been going on with you? I don't want to talk about my stuff. I'm done talking about it. What's going on with you.

14:01:07
<transcript>: Yeah. Sst is blowing up.

14:01:07
<transcript>: get in

14:01:10
<transcript>: Get in now or you're going to get left behind. Everybody.

14:01:13
<transcript>: Just go ahead.

14:01:26
<transcript>: How could you on the weekend.

14:01:26
<transcript>: dax

14:01:27
<transcript>: Dax.

14:01:37
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:01:42
<transcript>: Never.

14:02:21
<transcript>: Yeah, I see that.

14:03:04
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:04:27
<transcript>: Do you think that the fact that it takes so long? Is it just a function of time that graph never moving.

14:04:27
<transcript>: is it that char

14:04:33
<transcript>: Is it that chart where it's like, this is pointless. And then it takes off. Do you feel like now you've waited long enough.

14:04:46
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. Like the things you guys have been doing, like you just being a jerk on Twitter that's been working very effectively.

14:04:56
<transcript>: There's more change of strategy than a function of time.

14:05:05
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:05:35
<transcript>: I'm happy for you. I did want to point out that.

14:05:44
<transcript>: You've now talked about having meetings on Sunday and you quoted Bezos in the same episode so you will be canceled. I'm sorry I don't make the rules.

14:05:50
<transcript>: I love it.

14:05:56
<transcript>: Yeah, exactly. Hey, I've read that book. By the way, you tried to say I haven't read that book.

14:05:56
<transcript>: i read that

14:05:58
<transcript>: I read that book.

14:06:01
<transcript>: Did you offend me.

14:06:01
<transcript>: it's funny

14:06:03
<transcript>: It's funny.

14:06:11
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:06:40
<transcript>: Saw your queues? Tweet.

14:06:55
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:07:42
<transcript>: I would love for there to be definitive answers on stuff like that, because I always feel like there's so many. Where do you stop? There's so many places you could throw a queue in between two things. And it's like, I don't know where I'm creating just unnecessary bloat in where I'm really saving myself down the line. It's so hard to.

14:07:42
<transcript>: know early

14:07:47
<transcript>: Know early on so I'd love to know like a definitive guide on a flow chart.

14:07:47
<transcript>: this is where

14:07:51
<transcript>: This is where you're going to need some durability, and you better just put it there.

14:08:02
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:08:44
<transcript>: You just tweeted something about something unconventional. You solved. Oh, yeah. You just told me maybe in A. Dm, how'd you create the lambda warmer? Or do you not want to talk about it.

14:08:44
<transcript>: it's a secret

14:08:46
<transcript>: It's a secret sauce. Okay.

14:09:04
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:09:16
<transcript>: Edge edge, runtime stacks.

14:09:18
<transcript>: Sorry.

14:09:22
<transcript>: I did not.

14:09:22
<transcript>: it really

14:09:25
<transcript>: It really has. Yeah.

14:09:34
<transcript>: Which theo? I don't think theo listens to our podcast, but if you're listening, theo, I don't get the car seat thing. It just doesn't register with me. The car seats example.

14:09:34
<transcript>: my

14:09:39
<transcript>: My brain is not smart enough to put together the connection.

14:09:39
<transcript>: so just so you

14:09:41
<transcript>: So just so you know, some feedback.

14:09:57
<transcript>: I love the way you treat dev. It's so funny to me. He's like your little brother. And it's the best.

14:10:05
<transcript>: Dev is a person. By the way, I don't know if people listen to podcasts are like, what are you talking.

14:10:05
<transcript>: development

14:10:07
<transcript>: Development Software development.

14:10:10
<transcript>: Okay. Continue.

14:10:44
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:12:32
<transcript>: See, I this is where I was going to go with this.

14:12:32
<transcript>: i'm

14:12:52
<transcript>: I'm torn. Like when snap start. When they talk. That first came out. Is it snapstart? Yeah. And they had it for job. And they're like, eventually, maybe it'll be no js functions. There'll be no more idea of cold starts on your lambda functions for some increased cost or something. It was like a mixed emotions thing for me because I feel like I was ready for some of these things that are kind of made.

14:12:52
<transcript>: for the

14:12:55
<transcript>: For the old way to just die.

14:12:55
<transcript>: if prisma is just

14:13:11
<transcript>: If prisma is just not good and serverless, then we'll just find other ways. I was kind of hoping for that future. And now it's like you have to think about things differently. Well, I guess sure. Put express on your Lambda function and just run and express that I don't care. It doesn't matter anymore. Does it still matter.
