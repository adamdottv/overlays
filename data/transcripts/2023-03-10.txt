And it probably looks a lot like mine. But if you don't have kids, I can't even remember life before I had kids. It's been eight years. I've had kids.

00:14:09
<transcript>: what

00:14:15

00:15:03
cowfacedude99: @foobfoob check about

00:15:05
<transcript>: Then that means you thought yesterday was Wednesday. And yesterday, I thought it was Friday. So, yeah, we're two days apart.

00:15:08
trivenge: if you think about it, you dont make kids, you basically pay for it starting from their inception LUL

<transcript>: Overa watch people on twitch. Oh, that's what you do in your free time. Oh, that must be nice. And hack on side projects. I just pull up people on twitch while I'm working. Like when I get done streaming, I'm generally hanging out in other streamers chat because I get it now it's fun. Just fill.

00:16:16
<transcript>: A discourse going have them in my ear while I'm doing other stuff.

00:16:18

00:16:46
<transcript>: the

00:16:58
<transcript>: The headphones food. That's funny. I was in a headphone. I joined a headphone Twitter space last night. It was literally like a headphone expert didn't know these people existed. Dms, I think is his name.

00:16:58
<transcript>: and

00:17:00
cowfacedude99: You need to add your headphones to the about. @adamdotdev

00:17:03
<transcript>: And these headphones are sennheiser HD 650s. There you go.

00:17:08
<transcript>: Getting into a headphone Twitter space kind of made me want to buy new headphones.

00:17:08
<transcript>: i'm not gonna lie

00:17:10
<transcript>: I'm not gonna lie.

00:17:10
<transcript>: consumerism

00:17:11
<transcript>: Consumerism.

00:17:11
<transcript>: and

00:17:19
<transcript>: And I bet he's sponsored by sennheiser because he was talking about a lot of sensire, some sinhizer headphones. Or maybe he just really liked them.

00:17:19
trivenge: sennheiser 650 is fine

00:17:27
trivenge: its actually a very common industry mixing tool

00:17:28
<transcript>: Dax doesn't do math. Oh, yeah? When I was trying to figure out the dot, the times, the date, times, things.

00:17:34
<transcript>: If you think about it, you don't make kids. You basically pay for it. Starting from their inception.

00:17:38
<transcript>: You pay for it.

00:17:38
<transcript>: you

00:17:45
<transcript>: You don't make kids. You basically pay for it. Starting from their inception, I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Drive.

00:17:45
<transcript>: triumph sorry

00:17:49

00:17:50
<transcript>: Triumph. Sorry. We go by you by choice. Sure. That's what we call you.

00:17:53
<transcript>: Ocean. Welcome to Chat. This week was Rough, man.

00:17:59
<transcript>: Hey, Adam, what's your thoughts about decentralized apps? I'm sorry. This week was rough. First of all.

00:18:06
<transcript>: I apologize if I seem especially happy today. It's been a pretty good week for me, so I don't want to like.

00:18:13
trivenge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/peace-equalizer-apo-extension/  https://www.reddit.com/r/oratory1990/wiki/index/list_of_presets/  for future reference lol

00:18:19
trivenge: should put this in discord tbh

00:18:23
<transcript>: Make you feel worse. So I'm sorry you had a bad week. What are my thoughts about decentralized apps? I don't really have thoughts about decentralized apps, but don't read into that too much because I just don't have very many thoughts. We've addressed this this week on Stream. I'm a person who doesn't have a lot of thoughts.

00:18:23
<transcript>: that's

00:18:24
<transcript>: That's.

00:18:24
<transcript>: i don't know

<transcript>: Spaceballs. There's a good movie.

00:19:00
blizztera: do u think its ever worth learning assembly for some reason at uni they made us create an entire program in assembly

00:19:02
mehulsharmamat: heyoooo!

00:19:09
<transcript>: Also, I think spaceballs came out about the time the last time I watched movies, which was forever ago. I see everything when you have kids, you don't really do fun things like watch movies. Sorry. I'm making kids sound awful. I love my kids.

00:19:09
<transcript>: they're my favorite

00:19:12
<transcript>: They're my favorite thing in the world honestly.

00:19:12

<transcript>: I mean, Mobile wife, too. They're tied. They're all tied for my three favorite things in the world cafes. You need to add your headphones to the about. Yes, I do. I'll do that.

00:19:25
<transcript>: This is one of those things I say I'll do, and then I'll forget.

00:19:32
<transcript>: Triv synchronous Fine. Actually a very common industry mixing tool. Really.

00:19:34
<transcript>: I would recommend using.

00:19:34
<transcript>: oratory

00:19:37
<transcript>: Oratory eq via a tool like windows.

00:19:37
<transcript>: apple

00:19:40
<transcript>: Applebased Tools like Piece, gooey.

00:19:43
<transcript>: And then there's a link.

00:19:43
<transcript>: piece equal

00:19:59
<transcript>: Piece equalizer app. Someone else is just telling me. Nicholas was just telling me that digitally Q is bad, and I use digital eq. He wasn't aggressive about it. He was very kind. But he was like, Well, you're starting out with digital eq. So that's a problem. I didn't know this. I'm sorry to everyone who said to listen to my.

00:19:59
<transcript>: un

00:20:02
<transcript>: Unprepared voice.

00:20:02
<transcript>: for all

00:20:03
<transcript>: For all of my streams.

00:20:04
trivenge: digital eq is fine lol

00:20:06
<transcript>: I will check out those links to.

00:20:10
<transcript>: I do keep all of my transcripts and I can just look up later.

00:20:10
<transcript>: i'll be like

00:20:12
<transcript>: I'll be like.

00:20:14
<transcript>: Look up when I said.

00:20:24
<transcript>: I'll read those links, triv. I'll just do that. And I'll search in my text files of all these transcripts, and I'll find it. So I'll look those up in a bit.

00:20:30
cowfacedude99: !discord

00:20:30
<transcript>: Okay. Do you think it's ever worth learning assembly for some reason at uni.

00:20:30
<transcript>: they made us

00:20:30
fossabot: Adam has a Discord server and he'd love to see you there: https://discord.gg/E92M2chd3e

00:20:31
trivenge: pretty much the entire music and cinema industry uses digital eq

00:20:37
trivenge: a lot still use analog, but most use digital

00:20:45
cowfacedude99: a pretty good plug LUL @triveNge

00:20:47
<transcript>: They made us create an entire program in assembly. Okay, so, blizz, I would say it's worth learning. Assembly for fun. That sounds so fun. Maybe that's just me. And if it didn't sound fun to you at the time, then it's probably not worth it. I mean, occupationally. I can't imagine it comes up much unless you work.

00:20:47
<transcript>: for someone

00:20:48
<transcript>: For someone that.

00:20:48
<transcript>: i don't know

00:20:50
<transcript>: I don't know.

00:20:50
<transcript>: right

00:20:51
mehulsharmamat: learning anything sounds so fun lol

00:20:54
blizztera: it was annoying because we had to make a compiler

00:21:00
<transcript>: Right. The compilers for other languages and you need to know assembly. I don't think it is very practical in 2023, but it sounds like a ton of fun, like a ton.

00:21:06
<transcript>: May who will see her? Hey oh, digital EQ is fine okay? Good to know? Good to know.

00:21:09
trivenge: @cowfacedude99  huh?

00:21:11
<transcript>: Pretty much the entire music and cinema industry uses a digital EQ.

00:21:14
<transcript>: Locks still use analog, but most users use digital.

00:21:20
<transcript>: Yeah, good, good. Plug for the discord. Thanks for that.

00:21:32
<transcript>: Yeah. Learning things is fun. I agree. Maple. It's fun. It was annoying because we had to make a compiler. Yeah. I don't know if it sounds pretty fun to me. Maybe I'm just at the stage of my career where I've done so much stuff.

00:21:32
<transcript>: higher up

mehulsharmamat: imma hit the gym have fun y'all ill catch you laterr

daneoshiga: I've learned a little assembly on tech school and was fun, did an small "Simon" clone on a microcontroller

00:21:44
<transcript>: Higher up the stack like so many abstractions up that doing something that low level actually sounds like a lot of fun because it'd just be so foreign. I like learning things that are completely foreign, and I have no contact.

00:21:44
<transcript>: it's just like

00:21:48
<transcript>: It's just like that beginning phase, where you're learning so much, so fast.

00:22:18
<transcript>: As a software developer in the real world.

00:22:18
<transcript>: but i

00:22:21
<transcript>: But I think a lot of its foundational and it's helpful.

00:22:21
<transcript>: and

00:22:26
<transcript>: And it gives you just, like, a basis for what this all means. Like what a computer is doing.

00:22:26

<transcript>: There are a bunch of these.

00:23:16
<transcript>: shapes

00:23:17
<transcript>: Shapes.

00:23:23
<transcript>: And we need to handle all of these, but not limited to.

00:23:24
overra_dev: mostly squares

00:23:25
daneoshiga: that's about how I see code in friday (fuzzy is on)

00:23:37
<transcript>: Rhythm I got going.

00:23:38
<transcript>: Okay.

00:23:43
octogon: what am I looking at LUL

<transcript>: So there's my, my type. This one is a oh, it's oh, they're gonna be different shapes based on.

00:23:49
<transcript>: the sport

00:23:50
<transcript>: The sport.

00:23:52
cowfacedude99: that's me at the end of each day @daneoshiga LUL

<transcript>: Bummer, that's a bummer, that's a bummer.

00:23:57
<transcript>: Okay.

00:24:01
<transcript>: Oh, I'm sorry, guys. I'm on fuzzy.

00:24:01
thdxr: Adam is fuzzy on on purpose

<transcript>: mostly

00:24:08
<transcript>: Mostly squares.

00:24:08
<transcript>: those are most

00:24:11
<transcript>: Those are mostly squares. I apologize.

00:24:13
<transcript>: Should be better now.

00:24:13
<transcript>: probably still won't make any

00:24:14
thdxr: code looked better with fuzzy on

00:24:16
<transcript>: Probably still won't make any sense but should be better.

00:24:18
daneoshiga: LGTM approved

00:24:20
<transcript>: Outstairs.

00:24:20
<transcript>: out

00:24:22
<transcript>: Out.

00:24:27
overra_dev: lol

00:24:28
octogon: omg cursive programming

00:24:34
<transcript>: Different shape for every League. Oh, I could do more fancy typescript, things.

00:24:36
<transcript>: I could do more.

00:24:36
<transcript>: fancy

00:24:38
<transcript>: Fancy typescript, stuff.

00:24:43
cowfacedude99: union types?

00:24:44
<transcript>: Does it have the Little League in there? No. It's probably doesn't have the leak in there.

00:24:46
<transcript>: No.

00:24:52
<transcript>: Fancy typescript, stuff. It's just gonna be.

00:24:57
<transcript>: Messing the front end. I'm gonna need to know.

00:24:57
<transcript>: what

00:24:58
cowfacedude99: or even fancier?

00:25:03
thdxr: please get authorization from me to do fancy TS stuff

00:25:05
<transcript>: What League are we talking about here? And I'm gonna need to render stuff a little differently, so like, let's look at an mba box score.

00:25:08
<transcript>: Hey.

00:25:10
foobfoob: what made you choose astro instead of nextjs for statmuse?

00:25:26
<transcript>: So here's what it looks like for mba. I think that's what I'm looking around right now.

00:25:32
thdxr: because react is dead

00:25:34
<transcript>: I wonder how much overlap we're talking about. So NHL historical box score.

00:25:38
<transcript>: Let's look at NSL.

00:25:41
thdxr: listen to our podcast to learn more tomorrow.fm

00:25:43
<transcript>: Grid is always the same NFL Box score.

00:25:43
<transcript>: what's

00:25:47
<transcript>: What's I looking at in here? Box four, team definition.

00:25:52
<transcript>: Oh yeah, because home team and away team. So how different are these.

00:25:52
<transcript>: name abbrevia

00:25:54
octogon: rip React 20-something - 2023

00:25:58
<transcript>: Name abbreviation Record Score Logo Entity Name abbreviation Record Score Logo entity.

00:25:58
<transcript>: so

00:26:04
<transcript>: So they're the same on that about team detail. These are gonna get different.

00:26:04
<transcript>: box four

00:26:09
<transcript>: Box 14, detail. Yeah. First down. So they're not gonna have that on the basketball one. Okay, so.

00:26:18
<transcript>: Let's look at this in practice. So this. Yeah. It has like, all these labels.

00:26:24
<transcript>: But is it as simple? Is it like a grid where it's just as simple as render the label, then render the value.

00:26:24
<transcript>: let's look here

00:26:26
<transcript>: Let's look here.

00:26:36
<transcript>: Key value pairs of named stats and associated values for teams. Game for yeah, so Interestingly.

00:26:39
<transcript>: I don't see anywhere with a nice.

00:26:39
<transcript>: names

00:26:41
<transcript>: Names of them.

00:26:41
<transcript>: live

00:26:43
<transcript>: Live in the payload.

00:26:43
<transcript>: so i

00:26:45
<transcript>: So I have to just hard code the.

00:26:47
oleksii_lisovyi: Hello mister Adam!

00:26:51
<transcript>: Key.

00:26:55
<transcript>: We'll look at how the current front end does it.

00:26:58
<transcript>: That's player detail. Here's a summary.

00:27:03
<transcript>: Okay.

00:27:06
<transcript>: Hello, Alexey.

00:27:14
<transcript>: Rip React 20 something to 2023. That's funny.

00:27:20
foobfoob: @thdxr in which one do you talk about astro, the last one?

00:27:26
<transcript>: Please get authorization for me to do fancy ts stuff. Oh, yeah, yeah. Dax, I'm gonna definitely lean on you to do the fancy stuff because I'm not good at it.

00:27:31
moussx_: Astro is another front-end library is that it? What do they want to do differently than Svelte or Vue? I'm just a backend guy trying to understand stuff

00:27:33
<transcript>: I think it's even fancy as a Union types. Well, maybe not. Actually. Probably not.

00:27:43
daneoshiga: started studying react to improve full-stack opportunities job hunting, need to listen to the podcast to see why it's dead xD

00:27:45
<transcript>: And which one you talk about? Astro. Yeah, I was. I mean, to get a podcast podcast out yesterday, dax, but I think Chris hasn't gotten me another one yet, so I can't.

00:27:45
<transcript>: couldn't publish

00:27:48
<transcript>: Couldn't publish on Thursday. I think the next one we publish.

00:27:48
<transcript>: moose

00:27:50
<transcript>: Moose. Or noun. Sorry.

00:27:50
<transcript>: the next one

00:27:53
<transcript>: The next one we publish will be.

00:27:53
<transcript>: it'll be the

00:27:58
<transcript>: It'll be the one. Let's the end of react, talk about signals and.

00:27:58
<transcript>: that

00:28:00
<transcript>: That whole thing.

00:28:02
<transcript>: Okay.

00:28:02
<transcript>: so let's

00:28:05
oleksii_lisovyi: Real question for the keyboard enthusiasts: which 3D printer to choose to print Dactyl Manuform ü§ì

00:28:09
<transcript>: So let's see, this is a little more complicated than I thought it was gonna be because we don't just have one game result. We have.

00:28:09
<transcript>: each

00:28:13
<transcript>: Each League has its own shape of a historical box. Score.

00:28:13
<transcript>: which

00:28:15
<transcript>: Which is a bit of a bummer.

00:28:23
<transcript>: And what else do we have here? Detail stats. I really don't need to worry about these right now because I've already.

00:28:25
<transcript>: Already done them.

00:28:31
<transcript>: Like I've already done. Scheduled pages.

00:28:31
<transcript>: stand

00:28:33
<transcript>: Standings. Pages.

00:28:36
octogon: @moussx_ astro is great for websites, vue/react/svelte are for web apps. websites meaning purely info display

00:28:37
<transcript>: We just have to get the box for pages, so. Okay.

00:28:37
<transcript>: i'm now

00:28:47
<transcript>: I'm now I'm wondering. I'm wondering if I should even mess with the fancy type trip stuff and just do the easy thing because I see it in a path if half for an easy thing.

00:28:47
<transcript>: sometimes when

00:28:51
<transcript>: Sometimes when I see an easy path, I like to take the easy pass.

00:29:02
<transcript>: Well.

00:29:12
<transcript>: Let's just play this out. So let's say it's not actually game result detail. It's actually.

00:29:12
<transcript>: a box

00:29:16
<transcript>: A Box Score detail.

00:29:32
<transcript>: So these already. This is a this is a hockey one that I copied, isn't it? Yep.

00:29:34
<transcript>: Powerplay goals.

00:29:43
<transcript>: Okay. We could just have I could just say, NHL box for detail.

00:29:47
<transcript>: Does oh, does this down here? Does the visual have the League.

00:29:47
<transcript>: domain

00:29:54
<transcript>: Domain. Yes. Okay. So hear me out. This right here is a gamera domain.

00:29:54
<transcript>: what

00:29:56
<transcript>: What if.

00:30:00
<transcript>: We do this.

00:30:05
<transcript>: Based on the gamer domain, I could shape.

00:30:07
<transcript>: I could shape.

00:30:07
<transcript>: the

00:30:09
<transcript>: The detail.

00:30:13
<transcript>: I could choose a different type based on domain. Is that possible.

00:30:16
<transcript>: That even possible.

00:30:19
<transcript>: Also, I'm ultimately trying to get this type working.

00:30:19
<transcript>: as all

00:30:25
<transcript>: As all this other stuff visual is the part okay gamer game answer I should rename this.

00:30:29
<transcript>: Let's do box score.

00:30:31
<transcript>: Two words.

00:30:33
<transcript>: Let's enable keycaster.

00:30:48
<transcript>: Astros gaper Websites View React selch or for Web apps. Websites meaning purely info display. Yes, that means is more of a website than a Web app? I would say.

00:31:00
<transcript>: Oh and didn't actually dead react's not dead. I mean it's it's more like saying extreme things for clicks.

00:31:04
<transcript>: React is still the dominant.

00:31:04
<transcript>: front

00:31:04
oleksii_lisovyi: No-no-no

00:31:06
<transcript>: Front end framework.

00:31:06
<transcript>: the

00:31:07
<transcript>: The Xure.

00:31:08
oleksii_lisovyi: PHP IS DEAD!

00:31:10
oleksii_lisovyi: FOR SURE!

00:31:12
<transcript>: It's PHP is dead.

00:31:12
<transcript>: b is

00:31:13
thdxr: no react is dead for real

00:31:16
octogon: lies, react is DoA

00:31:18
<transcript>: B. Is it even dead? Nothing is dead. Jquery is probably the most popular javascript library in the world.

00:31:18
<transcript>: nothing

00:31:20
<transcript>: Nothing ever died.

00:31:26
physotronic: Knockout is dead Kappa

00:31:27
<transcript>: React is dead. For real. Oh, dax says it's actually dead. Okay, never mind. I take it all back. It's actually dead. You'll have to listen to the podcast.

00:31:30
cowfacedude99: I wrote jquery today YUCK

00:31:31
moussx_: @moussx_ Web apps differ from websites in that they have more ajax requests according to user interaction?

00:31:33
<transcript>: Let's try to be more like it depends everybody.

00:31:37
<transcript>: Outfits Road decry today.

00:31:41
oleksii_lisovyi: @PhysoTronic Magento 2 has it!

00:31:41
<transcript>: Interesting. Could you tell us more about that experience.

00:31:44
octogon: it depends how dead it is Kappa

00:31:45
daneoshiga: ok ok

00:31:48
<transcript>: I'm getting ready to just say, okay. So let's let's go to the actual page again and let's look at.

00:31:49
tayloreddev: i too am also in jquery hell

00:31:52
<transcript>: Where this is going to come into play so get game.

00:31:52
<transcript>: this thing

00:31:54
<transcript>: This thing returns.

00:32:00
<transcript>: A shape? But it should be based on the League Oh, Oh.

00:32:07
<transcript>: This is a thing I know I could do, dax. I know I could do this with your help.

00:32:15
oleksii_lisovyi: RequireJS

00:32:16
<transcript>: Instead of this always returning a gamera game answer, it should run a different type based on the gamma domain.

00:32:24
<transcript>: Does that mean okay, dax, simple question. Should I use a generic? Should I make gamera game answer have a generic type.

00:32:24
<transcript>: and the

00:32:27
<transcript>: And the type it know.

00:32:28
<transcript>: Now.

00:32:34
<transcript>: How should I do this when you call git game.

00:32:34
<transcript>: and

00:32:35
thdxr: I wasn't paying attention

00:32:36
<transcript>: And you pass.

00:32:36
<transcript>: specific

00:32:39
thdxr: dying from allergies

00:32:39
<transcript>: Specific gamera domain? Yeah. No, it's ax.

00:32:39
<transcript>: i'm still working

00:32:47
<transcript>: I'm still working through if I even have a question dying from allergies. Oh, no, we're getting old. I get allergies too now. I didn't used to. I do now.

00:32:51
<transcript>: So when you Paul when you call get game this function.

00:32:51
<transcript>: the return type

00:32:52
cowfacedude99: jquery + html mustache templates in express. not fun.

00:32:52
<transcript>: The return type.

00:32:52
<transcript>: will

00:33:01
<transcript>: Will depend on what you pass in in this param. Does that make sense? Is it possible to say based on the value here.

00:33:01
<transcript>: we know

00:33:04
<transcript>: We know exactly what the return type will be.

00:33:04
<transcript>: is

00:33:06
<transcript>: Is that possible.

00:33:12
<transcript>: I feel like that's the kind of like inferred typescript magic that you guys all do.

00:33:12
<transcript>: you smart people

00:33:14
<transcript>: You smart people.

00:33:18
octogon: @moussx_ web apps as in stuff like this site (twitch), yt, amazon. websites as in wikipedia, news sites, blogs

00:33:21
<transcript>: And I would like to do it right now, because it would make my life a lot easier.

00:33:22
thdxr: yes

00:33:23
oleksii_lisovyi: Are you using tRPC for the project @adamdotdev  ?

00:33:27
thdxr: but repeat what you said

00:33:27
cowfacedude99: You can do union types, I guess.

00:33:28
<transcript>: Using crpc for the Project no.

00:33:28
<transcript>: i

00:33:31
marcos_devone: getGame<T extends keyof GameDomain>(param: T): GameDomain[T]

00:33:32
<transcript>: I am not. I haven't even written.

00:33:32
<transcript>: if i'm being honest

00:33:40
<transcript>: If I'm being honest, I haven't written a single like client browser, makes an api call thing yet and there's not very many of them on statmese.com.

00:33:42
<transcript>: Okay.

00:33:42
<transcript>: yes but

00:33:53
<transcript>: Yes, but repeat what you said. So here's the thing domain is a it's a attribute of this object. That's the only prop right prop domain.

00:33:53
<transcript>: this

00:33:57
<transcript>: This value whatever they pass in here, whatever ipads in here.

00:33:57
<transcript>: will

00:34:07
<transcript>: Will dictate what the return type is. Each one of these. It's a onetoone. Each one of these. That values in this Union type maps to a different output type.

00:34:09
<transcript>: How.

00:34:09
<transcript>: oh

00:34:09
toox_96: Hello did you have exeprience  with ruby on rails ???

00:34:15
<transcript>: Oh, marcos, welcome to Chat. Marcos. Git game, txt. Extends kia of game domain paramet.

owencodes: HeyGuys

00:34:18
<transcript>: Oh Oh.

00:34:27
<transcript>: This looks so smart. An interface that maps them. Wait, what can I do with marcos? Said, look at this. Okay, so Marco says this should be.

00:34:27

00:34:55
<transcript>: Like so badly, but I know who you are if you work at a bs, I know who you are. An essay makes me think your solution back. That would make you think you work at a who I think it is is it who I think it is.

00:34:55
<transcript>: i'm baiting

00:34:57
<transcript>: I'm baiting you into chat.

00:35:01
<transcript>: Do you work on.

00:35:01
<transcript>: lam

00:35:03
<transcript>: Lambda Power tools.

00:35:09
cowfacedude99: wrong cam LUL

00:35:10
<transcript>: I'm just waiting on you? No pressure.

00:35:13
<transcript>: I'm just that's.

00:35:13
<transcript>: create an

00:35:15
<transcript>: Create an interface that maps them.

00:35:21
<transcript>: Was I looking in the wrong camera.

00:35:29
<transcript>: Somebody tell me, was I looking? That's what cafes. Who said I was looking at the wrong camera.

00:35:29
<transcript>: sorry

00:35:29
thdxr: where are the return types?

00:35:34
<transcript>: Sorry sometimes the cameras switch when I don't ask them to where are the return types.

00:35:34
<transcript>: i haven't made them yet

00:35:37
<transcript>: I haven't made them yet, but it's gonna be like.

00:35:37
<transcript>: the return

00:35:39
<transcript>: The return types are gonna look like.

00:35:48
<transcript>: Gamera, gamera Box Score or NBA mba Box score.

00:35:51
<transcript>: Or gamera.

00:35:51
<transcript>: nf

00:36:00
<transcript>: Nfl Box Score or gamera in hl Box for you know, I'm saying those are gonna be the different.

00:36:01
<transcript>: Types.

00:36:05
<transcript>: Instead of it being as gamer game answer right here.

00:36:05
thdxr: yeah make an interface that's like nba: {...}

00:36:09
octogon: oh so i wasn't reading things wrong, thought that was Camera LUL

00:36:17
<transcript>: That was Tamara.

00:36:20
thdxr: then you can take what Marcos sent you and look up the type against it

00:36:21
cowfacedude99: looks like you took the jib out of the closet.

00:36:22
<transcript>: Hey, Owen. Sorry. You waived. Hello.

00:36:22
<transcript>: tukes hello

00:36:28
<transcript>: Tukes. Hello. Did you have experience with ruby on rails? I've done a little bit of ruby on rails, just a little bit.

00:36:28
<transcript>: i want to try

00:36:31
<transcript>: I want to try and like, look through here.

00:36:31
<transcript>: marcus

00:36:40
<transcript>: Marcus example. Thank you so much. Welcome to my welcome to Chat marcos. Marco Says one get game, Txins, Kiev.

00:36:43
<transcript>: Kiav gamera domain.

00:36:43
<transcript>: okay

00:36:44
<transcript>: Okay.

00:36:49
thdxr: wouldn't be keyof

00:36:51
<transcript>: So T is one of those. And then you'll know which one that is.

00:36:59
<transcript>: By T like this? No. Am I doing something really weird? Oh, because this is a news. We have function.

00:37:17
<transcript>: Okay. I did it.

00:37:17
moussx_: @moussx_ I see, so the point seems to be about having the backend generate static content, and Astro would be some kind of layout-ing helper

00:37:21
<transcript>: So this would look like this. That needs to be.

00:37:21
<transcript>: gamera

00:37:26
<transcript>: Gamera box or answer which is temporary that's going away.

00:37:29
<transcript>: Okay. So.

00:37:29
<transcript>: then you

00:37:34
<transcript>: Then you can take what Mac marcos sent you and look up the type against it.

00:37:34
<transcript>: it looks like

00:37:41
<transcript>: It looks like you took the jib out of the closet. Oh, Cap. Yeah, I did. I got the movie going today.

00:37:41
<transcript>: wouldn't

00:37:43
<transcript>: Wouldn't be key of.

00:37:47
<transcript>: This wouldn't be key of.

00:37:47
<transcript>: oh

00:37:50
<transcript>: Oh, no, it wouldn't. What would it be.

00:37:51
<transcript>: Oh to be.

00:37:55
<transcript>: Of.

00:37:55
<transcript>: it's

00:37:58
thdxr: remove the keyof

00:38:01
<transcript>: It's the values of the discriminated. You the Union. I know so little.

00:38:06
<transcript>: Just remove it just like this. And that'll work.

00:38:10
<transcript>: So now T is.

00:38:13
<transcript>: Wait. Why.

00:38:16
<transcript>: T is what.

00:38:20
<transcript>: Tx sends gamer domain so this will be a gamera domain.

00:38:30
<transcript>: Gamera domain, but T doesn't extend gamma domain. It just is gamera domain.

00:38:30
<transcript>: does

00:38:32
<transcript>: Does that make sense.

00:38:33
marcos_devone: check this example: https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/C4TwDgpgBA4ghgWwgEQPYLgSwHZQLxQBEq2EhUAPkcAO6rlWHAAWAThGQNwBQ3OwEVgDM4AY2gAlCAGcoAb25QlUEhABcRZpkIAaRctqoNhZhAA2Z+nuVQW7dUQASHEIW4BfXqJLTgUAOYQwPBI+FAAPAAqUBAAHgLYACayISjoWNgAfAAUYHCsiBqRAJQaUtIA2pEAuviZ8vpK3ti+KgBGAFZlMmEKNsqqxlq6jTZ2HMbOEK7W-bZ0Q+aWbjaeo+zAAK6suKidFXkFCNUeQA  this is from typescript playgroud

00:38:37
<transcript>: Moose. I see. So the pool. Whoa.

00:38:46
<transcript>: Marcus, that's a big link on this on this page that I'm looking at. This is from Thai Script Playground. Okay, let me see here. Check this example.

00:38:46
<transcript>: i hate

00:38:46
octogon: @moussx_ yup astro shifts things back into the server rendering territory

00:38:48
marcos_devone: sorry

00:38:59
<transcript>: I hate when stuff opens in firefox. That is not what I'm looking at. I am looking at Chrome. Oh, you're fine, marcos. It is especially big on my little. I've got this thing zoomed in so I can reach out really good because I'm getting old.

00:38:59
<transcript>: open

00:39:06
<transcript>: Open in Chrome. Come on now. I don't ever want to open in firefox. Please stop doing that computer.

00:39:07
physotronic: what is that icon with A?

00:39:11
physotronic: when you alt tab

00:39:11
<transcript>: T extends game domain.

00:39:11
<transcript>: param

00:39:13
<transcript>: Paramt.

00:39:13
moussx_: @moussx_ Cool cool, thanks for your time

00:39:16
thdxr: Marcos link is right but you can do another trick with satisfies to make it more typesafe

00:39:22
<transcript>: Extends. Oh, you like you're doing it just like, yeah, okay. You even use the words. The words that I use.

00:39:22
<transcript>: so

00:39:27
<transcript>: So response equals that and then object. Oh, so this is like what dax was saying.

00:39:27
<transcript>: an interface

00:39:30
<transcript>: An interface? Oh, I gotcha, I gotcha.

00:39:35
<transcript>: You can do another trick with satisfies to make it even more type safe.

00:39:35
<transcript>: we

00:39:39
<transcript>: We want to do that. We want to do it next, because we're doing stuff today.

00:39:43
<transcript>: So I would ultimately make like a interface.

00:39:44
thdxr: one sec

00:39:46
<transcript>: Box score.

00:39:48
<transcript>: Map. What was.

00:39:53
<transcript>: A follow.

00:39:56
cowfacedude99: getting into typescript 5.0

00:39:57
<transcript>: Marcos. And it devx.

00:39:57
<transcript>: thank you

00:40:00
<transcript>: Thank you for those follows.

00:40:04
<transcript>: Am I even using typescript files five I don't even know.

00:40:16
<transcript>: Oh, can I just upgrade to typescript Five without breaking things? I'm using ssc decks.

00:40:22
thdxr: you don't need 5

00:40:24
<transcript>: What is that icon with a when you alt test.

00:40:25
cowfacedude99: I need to catch up (or run away to go) LUL

00:40:26
<transcript>: Allow.

00:40:27
thdxr: that's too much power

00:40:30
<transcript>: allowed

00:40:30
<transcript>: allowed to catch

00:40:33
<transcript>: Allowed to catch up or run away to go.

00:40:39
<transcript>: You don't need five. That's too much power, okay? Yeah, I don't need five. No.

00:40:48
<transcript>: Oh, what did you call? This was gonna look at what do you call it? Rest. So I'm gonna call mine.

00:40:52
<transcript>: Box score or I guess response that way.

00:40:55
<transcript>: Be a little more verbose if you will.

00:40:57
oleksii_lisovyi: For me having so few TypeScript exp. this looks like so much boilerplate.

00:40:57
ocelot2123: woah what is this production value

00:41:02
<transcript>: So response, and I'm gonna just do it's, gonna have values.

00:41:02
<transcript>: so like

00:41:03
<transcript>: So like.

00:41:07
<transcript>: Gamer domain is capital Emory yeah like that.

00:41:09
<transcript>: Okay.

00:41:09
<transcript>: but this is gonna

00:41:20
<transcript>: But this is gonna be like mba box score answer. That's a terrible name. Let's just at least delete answer. So we're gonna name it gamer, NBA Back box score.

00:41:20
<transcript>: wonder if

00:41:30
<transcript>: Wonder if I shouldn't prefix everything with camera trying to signify that it's something that came from gamera, which is our other service for me having so few typescript experiences looks like.

00:41:30
<transcript>: so much

00:41:34
<transcript>: So much boilerplate. I think it's gonna pay off, Alexi.

00:41:34
<transcript>: it's gonna pay off

00:41:36
<transcript>: It's gonna pay off here in a minute.

00:41:41
<transcript>: What is this? Production value? Osolette. It's kind of my thing. I'm just. I'm not.

00:41:41
<transcript>: like hands

00:41:46
<transcript>: Like handsome or entertaining or funny. So I just do really good production value.

00:41:46
<transcript>: that's what you get

00:41:48
<transcript>: That's what you get around here.

00:41:48
<transcript>: production

00:41:49
traylortrash84: Good morning.

00:41:52
cowfacedude99: !lurk

00:41:52
<transcript>: Production value. And occasionally I write a few lines of code.

00:41:57
cowfacedude99: see you in about an hour.

00:42:01
<transcript>: Not very often. Mostly I talk on chat. Or I talk to chat. Goodbye, cow face. Goodbye, trailer trash. Good morning, trailer.

00:42:08
<transcript>: See you in an hour. I will be right here. We will have accomplished a lot in an hour. I bet you I'll bet you.

00:42:08
<transcript>: okay let's

00:42:11
<transcript>: Okay. Let's go in here and go ahead and step out.

00:42:11
<transcript>: what these are gonna

00:42:15
oleksii_lisovyi: Sure, I just throwing in you my feeling, not that need to do something about it ;p

00:42:15
<transcript>: What these are gonna look like? Export interface. I might even just like.

00:42:23
<transcript>: Mba box for I might even just like, hard code all of these and just say, screw it. I'm not gonna do something fancy with all this.

00:42:27
<transcript>: I could do something fancy with all this. But it's just feeling like.

00:42:27
<transcript>: less and less

00:42:29
<transcript>: Less and less worth it.

00:42:34
<transcript>: How many sports are there? Five.

00:42:34
cowfacedude99: I want to wage channel points against that LUL

00:42:38
<transcript>: So this is gonna be.

00:42:40
<transcript>: In FL.

00:42:43
<transcript>: flb

00:42:43
<transcript>: Flb.

00:42:50
<transcript>: And PGA.

00:42:50
<transcript>: there aren't pg

00:42:51
<transcript>: There aren't PGA boxes.

00:42:51
<transcript>: that's not

00:42:53
<transcript>: That's not a thing.

00:42:53
<transcript>: right

00:42:54
<transcript>: Right.

00:42:54
<transcript>: that's not

00:42:56
<transcript>: That's not a thing.

00:42:58
azm191: what is this dev setup, neovim?

00:42:58
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:42:58
<transcript>: i don't think it's

00:43:00
<transcript>: I don't think it's a thing.

00:43:03
<transcript>: Yeah, we have NHL.

00:43:18
<transcript>: what

00:43:24
<transcript>: What is this? Dev setup. Welcome to Chad azm. This is Neil Them. Yes, it is. Neil them.

00:43:24
<transcript>: you want

00:43:26
<transcript>: You want to wage channel points again.

00:43:32
sockthedev: üíú

00:43:36
<transcript>: Lexi. Sure. Just throwing in you my feeling. Not that you need to do something about it. I do need to do something about it, though. I need to get this stuff done.

00:43:36
<transcript>: sock i appreciate you

00:43:37
<transcript>: Sock. I appreciate you.

00:43:39
<transcript>: I really suck. I got really excited about playing.

00:43:39
<transcript>: among us with

00:43:45
<transcript>: Among us with you. And now I really want to play among us with you. So I need you to figure out how to get it installed. Maybe.

00:43:45
<transcript>: i'm gonna install

00:43:49
0xcouch: Early in my career I would have made a complex extendable interface for BoxScore that each sport could inherit from. Now I'm just lazy i think.

00:43:52
<transcript>: I'm gonna install it. I'm gonna do like a vm. I think I'm gonna, like, do a Windows vm on my Mac so I can play games in their native.

00:43:52
<transcript>: tongue

00:43:53
<transcript>: Tongue.

00:43:53
<transcript>: well not

00:43:57
sockthedev: me too. i need an M2 (getting one in the next month)

00:44:00
oleksii_lisovyi: Oh not, that

00:44:04
oleksii_lisovyi: 's a trap

00:44:06
<transcript>: Well, not games among us. That's the only game I play early in my career. I would have made a complex extendable interface for box score that each sport could inherit from. Now, I'm just lazy. I think that's what I'm thinking. Couch. I'm thinking I'm just gonna, like.

00:44:06
<transcript>: in line them all

00:44:13
<transcript>: In line them all I don't care what they share in common? I'm just gonna, like, drop them all in there and say, Forget it, forget about it.

00:44:20
<transcript>: Oh, no, not that it's a trap. Oh.

00:44:20
<transcript>: among us

00:44:23
<transcript>: Among us need an M two getting one in the next month.

00:44:35
<transcript>: Oh, suck. You didn't. You didn't subscribe for six months.

00:44:35
<transcript>: you subscribed

00:44:42
<transcript>: You subscribed. I mean, you didn't. This isn't your six month subscribing. You just subscribed all at once for six months in advance.

00:44:44
<transcript>: Whoa.

00:44:47
<transcript>: That is that was actually.

00:44:47
<transcript>: exactly

00:44:48
sockthedev: yep

00:44:51
<transcript>: Exactly what I needed to make sure I keep streaming consistently for the next six months.

00:44:51
<transcript>: because

00:44:55
<transcript>: Because I'll always remember if I take a break, that socks extra.

00:44:57
<transcript>: Six months.

00:44:57
<transcript>: can't be

00:44:58
<transcript>: Can't be taken breaks.

00:44:58
<transcript>: we got it delivered

00:45:00
<transcript>: We got it delivered.

00:45:01
oleksii_lisovyi: I purchased a Mac back in the days for a reason not playing games

00:45:04
sockthedev: :D

00:45:05
<transcript>: So I'm gonna try I'm gonna try to do five days a week for these six months.

00:45:05
<transcript>: because i'm trying

00:45:11
<transcript>: Because I'm trying to make it part of my, like, just sustainable. This is how my work day goes, you know.

00:45:16
<transcript>: And that's I'm trying to grow up the first time I streamed those first few months.

00:45:16
<transcript>: i don't think

00:45:21
<transcript>: I don't think I really was trying to be sustainable. I was just like.

00:45:24
oleksii_lisovyi: And it worked out! So hold strong Adam üí™!

00:45:26
sockthedev: money well spent then

00:45:29
<transcript>: I'm gonna do stuff for the stream's sake. Now you guys are gonna just come along with me. You know, I'm gonna do stuff that I would already have to do.

00:45:29
<transcript>: and that way

00:45:32
<transcript>: And that way I can stream every day. That's the goal.

00:45:37
<transcript>: I purchased a Mac back in the days.

00:45:37
<transcript>: for a reason

00:45:39
<transcript>: For a reason not playing games.

00:45:39
<transcript>: and it

00:45:44
sockthedev: you are one of the few streamers that work well for my Bali timezone

00:45:49
<transcript>: And it worked out so hopes strong. Adam. Yeah, yeah. Alexey. I played my wife and I talked about it and decided I could play among us with some friends.

00:45:53
<transcript>: I haven't played video games in years because I have very addictive personality.

00:45:53
<transcript>: and

00:46:00
<transcript>: And among us was good good times. It was a lot of fun. And I'm terrible. But.

00:46:00
<transcript>: it was fun

00:46:05
<transcript>: It was fun. It's more of a social thing than a game thing. I think among us is more about, like.

00:46:05
<transcript>: the laugh

00:46:06
<transcript>: The laugh.

00:46:07
fragaverage: and Adam is already addicted to playing it

00:46:14
<transcript>: Money well spent. You are one of the few streamers that work well for my bali time zone. Well, that's awesome.

00:46:14
<transcript>: i do stream weird

00:46:18
<transcript>: I do stream weird hours in terms of us streamers at least.

00:46:22
thdxr: the key is having to play with other people because you can't get addicted since scheduling is so effing hard

00:46:24
sockthedev: yeah, among us is one of those games where a few games is satisfying enough

00:46:33
oleksii_lisovyi: Do you have a console? IDK if AmongUs is in there tho.

00:46:34
<transcript>: I'm already addicted to playing. It's true. Listen, I have an addictive personality. It was expected that I would play it once and want to play it every single moment. But the good news is I can't. I need six or eight friends to play with me, so it naturally paces itself. You know what I mean.

00:46:43
<transcript>: Yes exactly back like I don't know when will ever be able to schedule.

00:46:48
<transcript>: A good session. Although I want to maybe today. Let's do it today.

00:46:51
<transcript>: Mba.

00:46:51
<transcript>: box

00:46:53
<transcript>: Boxcore. Okay.

00:47:02
<transcript>: Nfl is gonna be just like that one. But gamera in sl Box score.

00:47:02
<transcript>: okay

00:47:03
<transcript>: Okay.

00:47:08
<transcript>: I didn't get that one imported. There we go.

00:47:08
<transcript>: and then

00:47:10
<transcript>: And then let's do MLB.

00:47:12
<transcript>: Camera.

00:47:12
<transcript>: game

00:47:17
<transcript>: Gamera MLB boxcore.

00:47:20
<transcript>: What's great about stat muse is.

00:47:22
<transcript>: Oops.

00:47:22
<transcript>: that was great

00:47:42
<transcript>: That was great about Statmes is it doesn't matter if a sport is completely obscured and nobody cares like nobody cares about baseball. Honestly, who cares about baseball? I don't think any cares. Doesn't matter. Sammy still gets a ton of usage because the people who use statues are betting on baseball. They don't like baseball. They're just betting on it.

00:47:42
<transcript>: so they

00:47:47
<transcript>: So they use statmes to search stuff for their bedding.

00:47:52
<transcript>: Among other.

00:47:52
<transcript>: games

00:48:01
<transcript>: Games where a few games are satisfying enough. Yeah, that's what I'm going with. I was sadisfied after those few games. I didn't want to play the rest of the day.

00:48:09
<transcript>: Do you have a console? I don't know if among us is in there too. I don't have a console. I've had a console since.

00:48:09
<transcript>: i actually won

00:48:19
<transcript>: I actually won an Xbox One. Is that what they're called Xbox One? I one, like on a Twitter thing or something. I don't even remember what I did if I just.

00:48:19
<transcript>: submit to my email

00:48:22
<transcript>: Submit to my email for a newsletter or something, but I won.

00:48:22
<transcript>: they sent it to me

00:48:39
<transcript>: They sent it to me. And what's crazy is crazy story. My wife won the same day we had never either one of us won anything in our lives. Same day she won a mixer. Like a Kitchen aid mixer from, like the kitchen store that we used to go to all the time. Four. We had kids.

00:48:43
<transcript>: Crazy. Both one things.

00:48:45
<transcript>: Prizes.

00:48:46
oleksii_lisovyi: Lucky dsy

00:48:48
<transcript>: What's the Christmas story.

00:48:48
oleksii_lisovyi: *day

00:48:51
<transcript>: It's an award.

00:48:51
<transcript>: what's

00:48:56
sj_se: yoyo

00:49:01
<transcript>: What's the line there? I can't think of it. Yeah, I was our lucky days. We were we were feeling pretty lucky. I don't think we bought any scratcher tickets. We should have SJ's here. What's going on? Sj.

00:49:09
<transcript>: Okay, so here's my interface. Now we have git txins gamer domain domain is P, and then.

00:49:09
<transcript>: what can i do

00:49:11
<transcript>: What can I do with satisfies.

00:49:11
<transcript>: how can i do

00:49:13
<transcript>: How can I do that.

00:49:18
sj_se: do you primarily focus on frontend development?

00:49:21
<transcript>: And then I'm gonna say instead of as gamera game answer, I'm gonna say as.

00:49:23
thdxr: ignore me on satisfies

00:49:23
<transcript>: Response.

00:49:23
<transcript>: and then

00:49:26
<transcript>: And then pass in domain.

00:49:26
<transcript>: igno

00:49:28
<transcript>: Ignore me unsatisfied. Okay? Nevermind.

00:49:33
<transcript>: I domain cannot be used as an index.

00:49:36
thdxr: not domain pass in T

00:49:37
marcos_devone: pass the T

00:49:40
<transcript>: As an index type domain refers to a value that is being used as a type here. Did you mean type of domain.

00:49:40
<transcript>: oh

00:49:44
<transcript>: Oh past the T pass in T.

00:49:47
<transcript>: Oh T.

00:49:53
<transcript>: Oh, do I need to make a response? Let's see. Let me look at your example and stop asking you to repeat yourself.

00:49:57
<transcript>: Txins.

00:49:59
<transcript>: Type in.

00:50:03
<transcript>: Object response.

00:50:03
<transcript>: what

00:50:05
<transcript>: What, what.

00:50:05
<transcript>: oh i have to

00:50:07
<transcript>: Oh, I have to make an object of it.

00:50:09
<transcript>: Of that type.

00:50:13
thdxr: does Response have all the keys that can be in it?

00:50:14
<transcript>: To make an object of it.

00:50:14
<transcript>: so is that

00:50:16
<transcript>: So is that it.

00:50:17
thdxr: no you don't need to make an object

00:50:19
thdxr: that was an example

00:50:23
<transcript>: Does response have all the keys that can be in it? Yes.

00:50:23
<transcript>: let me make sure

00:50:24
<transcript>: Let me make sure.

00:50:29
<transcript>: No pda? Oh, no.

00:50:29
<transcript>: okay

00:50:38
thdxr: see that's why typesafety is good!

00:50:40
thdxr: just caught a bug

00:50:42
<transcript>: Okay. No, it doesn't. I don't know what. Okay, so here's the thing. There's never a reason to call get game with PGA. So I should just make a new type. Shouldn't I.

00:50:45
marcos_devone: all of the keys should be in the Response

00:50:45
<transcript>: Should make a new type.

00:50:51
<transcript>: No, you don't need an object. That was an example. See what? That's why tape safety is good. It's right.

00:50:54
thdxr: just add PGA: any

00:50:58
<transcript>: Just caught a bug. All of the keys should be in the response, so I just need.

00:50:58
<transcript>: just add

00:51:05
<transcript>: Just add PGA any. Oh, I could do that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That's better than having another.

00:51:07
<transcript>: Type in there probably.

00:51:07
<transcript>: oh

00:51:11
<transcript>: Oh, it worked, it worked, it worked.

00:51:15
thdxr: or do extends Omit<GamersDomain, "PGA">

00:51:16
<transcript>: I might even like throw here if domain.

00:51:21
<transcript>: Type of Or How do I say if it's PGA.

00:51:21
<transcript>: extend

00:51:25
<transcript>: Extends. Yeah. I thought about doing an omit thing. I actually know how to do that.

00:51:25
<transcript>: gamer

00:51:29
schrew: gm!

00:51:31
thdxr: that's just normal js adam

00:51:32
<transcript>: Gamers domain PGA I thought about doing that, but then I have like this other type floating around. I guess that's okay.

00:51:34
<transcript>: Good morning? True.

00:51:35
thdxr: if (domain === "PGA")

00:51:36
thdxr: lol

00:51:39
marcos_devone: hooray!!

00:51:40
<transcript>: That's just normal js? Yeah, I don't know, normal js if domain.

00:51:46
<transcript>: It's even trying to tell me it's even trying to tell me the answer and I don't know.

00:51:50
<transcript>: I haven't.

00:51:52
<transcript>: I haven't actually.

00:51:54
<transcript>: Okay.

00:51:54
<transcript>: okay so that's

00:51:54
thdxr: props.domain

00:52:00
<transcript>: Okay, so that's the domain is PGA. You shouldn't be calling this function. Get dummy. I'm gonna make it more descriptive.

00:52:09
<transcript>: There are no pda box scores.

00:52:15
<transcript>: I really want to say, dummy. I'm the only one that'll read it, so I'm gonna put it, dummy. Okay.

00:52:19
<transcript>: Let's see, game ID, pars, game ID. And then.

00:52:30
<transcript>: This works. This works. This is gonna give me the right type. I love it. I love typescript. I love it. Props. That domain. I could have done that, but instead, I just moved it down.

00:52:36
<transcript>: Pull the domain out after I deconstruct ooh, I knew a fancy word deconstruct.

00:52:36
<transcript>: that's

00:52:44
<transcript>: That's an object deconstruction. Right, hooray. Thank you so much, marcos. And dax, for making this possible. I could not have done it without you.

00:52:44
<transcript>: obviously

00:52:48
<transcript>: Obviously I can't do much without any of you.

00:52:53
<transcript>: Okay.

00:52:53
<transcript>: let's see

00:52:56
oleksii_lisovyi: Is there in TS such a thing like having an interface and few implementations of it, so you can have an argument in a function of type interface, but provide different implementation in the runtime. I'm not sure if this is feasible option, but still good to know.

00:52:59
<transcript>: Let's see, let's go. Now we can go into the actual types and flush these out.

00:53:12
ezteq: Hi, is your camera moving or is it just vfx :D

00:53:15
<transcript>: Is there NTS such a thing like having an interface and few implementations of it so you can have an argument in a function of type interface but provide different implementation in the runtime. Not sure if this is a feasible option, but still good to know. I don't know. Alexi, that question was too smart for me.

00:53:16
sockthedev: seen the total typescript course is out? https://www.totaltypescript.com/ pretty hefty cost, but that man truly is a wizard

00:53:21
<transcript>: Easy tech hygiene. Your camera moving. Or is it just visual effects? It is moving.

00:53:21
<transcript>: so

00:53:24
<transcript>: So it's just on an continuous.

00:53:31
<transcript>: Looping movement on my gib in the corner of the room, and I thought that add a little spice.

00:53:33
algebra97: It's an AI camera

00:53:36
<transcript>: And I wanted to move my the camera I did have there. I wanted to use it for YouTube.

00:53:36
<transcript>: so it's an

00:53:37
ezteq: Thats really nice

00:53:39
<transcript>: So it's an AI camera? Welcome to Chat, algebra.

00:53:44
<transcript>: Just always trying to add a little spice to the stream.

00:53:47
<transcript>: This is a fun hobby.

00:53:47
<transcript>: streaming

00:53:48
<transcript>: Streaming.

00:53:48
<transcript>: okay

00:53:55
oleksii_lisovyi: It's not real, just matrix KAPPA

00:53:55
<transcript>: Okay, gamera box for answers. So it's gonna look like this one. I guess I could do, like I could do a generic here.

00:53:55
<transcript>: if that's the right way

00:54:05
<transcript>: If that's the right way to do this, I could say because there is so much in common, like everything but visual and even visual. Only a piece of visual is different based on.

00:54:05
<transcript>: the league

00:54:10
<transcript>: The League. So I guess I could I could say like this.

00:54:12
<transcript>: Or something.

00:54:12
<transcript>: i got

00:54:16
<transcript>: I got to actually make visual dynamic or generic.

00:54:16
<transcript>: like

00:54:19
<transcript>: Like I could do something like this.

00:54:23
<transcript>: Drive that T all the way down into the detail.

00:54:26
<transcript>: Is this the way to do it.

00:54:29
<transcript>: Is this the way is this away.

00:54:29
<transcript>: seen

00:54:35
<transcript>: Seen the total typescript courses out. Oh, pretty hefty cost, but that made truly is wizard. Yeah, no, I have sock.

schrew: Dax taking some time off from twitch chat to subtweet us KEKW

00:54:41
<transcript>: I don't know that I use typescript in the.

00:54:45
<transcript>: Advanced usages of typescript enough to spend the time.

00:54:50
thdxr: @Schrew hahaha

00:54:57
thdxr: you caught me

00:54:58
<transcript>: On doing that. Oh, clip, two Brown. Oh, oh, did I miss some falls? I'm so sorry, people. I missed your follows. Clipped to Brown. Thanks so much for the follow, maestro. Coc algebra. Thank you all for the follows.

00:55:06
<transcript>: Yes, I've tweeted oh, we're not gonna just let that slide. We're gonna pull it up right now.

00:55:06
<transcript>: dax sub tw

00:55:07
yeltrah_: Hey

00:55:07
algebra97: you're welcome

00:55:08
<transcript>: Dax? Sub? Tweets? Me.

00:55:08
<transcript>: live

00:55:10
thdxr: SHIT

00:55:11
thdxr: NOO

00:55:12
thdxr: STOP

00:55:13
<transcript>: Live on Twitch don't really understand why people destructure objects.

00:55:23
sockthedev: hahaha

00:55:24
thdxr: I'm embarassed

00:55:30
<transcript>: Have it left over from nazi's days to hint to your editor what variables are available in ts world. It adds duplicate also loses context of where the various came from.

00:55:39
<transcript>: It. Don't be embarrassed. Backs. Come on. After the hell I put you through yesterday, you are allowed to subtweet me like four or five times today. Okay.

00:55:39
<transcript>: just do it

00:55:46
<transcript>: Just do it. You're not even subtweeting me because you could just tell me the answer right now. I want your answer. What should I do.

00:55:54
thdxr: I had this tweet in the works for years

00:55:57
<transcript>: What should I do instead? I've seen I've actually dax, this isn't even embarrassing. Because I've seen you say that before, and I still do it. I'm pretty sure. Okay. We're gonna do it. We're gonna search. Hang on.

00:55:57
<transcript>: where's

00:55:57
sockthedev: i agree. for react props i always do; props.foo

00:55:58
oceannn__: LUL

00:56:01
thdxr: wait did I already tweet this before

00:56:02
<transcript>: Where's? Chrome? I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure you've said it before. Dax, have you not said it before.

00:56:06
<transcript>: Have you not ever said.

00:56:09
<transcript>: How do I search just your Tweets? Oh, I can do it on mobile.

00:56:09
<transcript>: hang

00:56:09
sockthedev: dax is normally right

00:56:14
oleksii_lisovyi: That's such a nice entertainment, please more!

00:56:14
<transcript>: Hang on. I'm just. I'm positive I've read this. Tweet. Maybe it wasn't you.

00:56:14
<transcript>: i

00:56:18
<transcript>: I'll see DAX.

00:56:21
oetziofficial: bashNote

00:56:22
<transcript>: In the meantime, I need to know what I should do instead.

00:56:22
thdxr: I don't have another tweet that says destructure in it

00:56:29
<transcript>: Don't have another tweet that says these structure. Oh, you already searched it. Okay, you're faster than me.

00:56:29
<transcript>: well shoot

00:56:30
thdxr: I'm getting to the point where I'm retweeting tweets

00:56:31
sockthedev: should have blocked him dax

00:56:32
vapor__dev: this tweet gonna spark a viral thread on twitter. ‚ÄúI actually prefer destructing‚Ä¶‚Äù

00:56:38
thdxr: repeating*

00:56:42
<transcript>: Well, shoot. I'm pretty sure I've read that someone else has had that take, like, don't do that. I don't know why everyone does that at the top. Very faction. I always do that. And I've seen the take, and I still always do it. I need to know what to do instead, though.

00:56:45
uberrick: as in just use props.game with auto complete of props in TS

00:56:49
<transcript>: Should I not use an object here for just three of these? Should it just be three ordered? Params.

00:56:54
<transcript>: Into the point where I'm retweeting tweets or repeating tweets? Yeah.

00:56:55
thdxr: @vapor__dev no objects are good

00:57:02
<transcript>: I agree for reaction props. I always do prop stop Foo.

00:57:11
<transcript>: Honestly, I have no idea why I destructure it. That's a good point. I could just literally do props, dot all these things.

00:57:11
<transcript>: why

00:57:12
thdxr: I would just delete line 4 and just do `props.xxx`

00:57:14
<transcript>: Why would I ever destructure it.

00:57:14
<transcript>: oh you just

00:57:19
<transcript>: Oh, you just said why I did in the just elite line for and just do props. X. Exact. Okay.

00:57:30
<transcript>: You just said why people do it. And I already forgot. I gotta read both the Tweet again. Perhaps game. Am I just trying to save typing props a lot? Is that it.

00:57:30
<transcript>: that's not

00:57:32
<transcript>: That's not very smart.

00:57:32
<transcript>: what was that

00:57:33
thdxr: and then it's clear it's props vs a derived value from props

00:57:33
<transcript>: What was that.

00:57:39
<transcript>: Paranormal.

00:57:39
<transcript>: what

00:57:41
<transcript>: What is for.

00:57:45
<transcript>: Oh possibly.

00:57:48
algebra97: props?.params

00:57:56
<transcript>: If or not, it's not gonna be because I'm gonna say props, not friends. Now I can get rid of that question Mark. That's silly question Mark. Okay.

00:57:56
<transcript>: cool we

00:58:00
<transcript>: Cool. We did it. We decide our code.

00:58:06
<transcript>: And then it's clear it's props versus a derivative from props. I gotcha that makes a lot of sense.

00:58:06
<transcript>: no

00:58:08
<transcript>: No objects are good. Okay.

00:58:19
<transcript>: I gotta actually read your tweet. Now I was too busy laughing just at the irony. Just like not the irony, but just the moment that this is where we're being subtweeted live.

00:58:19
oleksii_lisovyi: dxlinter

00:58:24
<transcript>: Don't really understand why people do search drivers.

00:58:24
<transcript>: the habit

00:58:28
marcos_devone: you can do it   ({domain, game, params}: Type)  if you prefer

00:58:28
<transcript>: The habit left over from Nonts days to hint to your editor what variables are available.

00:58:28
<transcript>: in ts world

00:58:31
algebra97: how did you generate those pictures of the players? What library did you use for that?

00:58:32
<transcript>: In ts world, adds duplication also loses context of where the variety.

00:58:32
<transcript>: actually don't

00:58:36
<transcript>: Actually don't think that middle sentence. I actually don't think.

00:58:45
vapor__dev: They‚Äôre drawn by a real man

00:58:56
<transcript>: I don't think that I picked it up. I don't think it. That's why, for me, I think I just am dumb. And I like destructuring. I think it looks cool. That's honestly, it. I think I do structure, because it looks cool. That's funny. Also, DAX, I just realized you don't do punctuation. And I realized I've gone full. Dax I've turned into because I do think it looks.

00:59:08
thdxr: great now I have to change my style

00:59:09
<transcript>: Cool. I now tweet an all lower caps and I don't lowercase and I don't do punctuation either. I didn't know I got the no punctuation thing from you, but it just feels good. It does feel good to not do punctuation.

00:59:13
<transcript>: This is Tweet form. This is Peak Tweet form right here.

00:59:15
<transcript>: Great.

00:59:17
thdxr: GoNNa tYPe liKe THiS

00:59:19
sockthedev: you could also shorten props -> p as a standard

00:59:21
<transcript>: That's funny. Okay, let's actually let's get back to it.

00:59:21
<transcript>: now that

00:59:23
<transcript>: Now that we've been subtweeted.

00:59:23
<transcript>: holy

00:59:25
<transcript>: Holy cow.

00:59:25
<transcript>: my son

00:59:27
<transcript>: My son.

00:59:27
<transcript>: when he

00:59:31
<transcript>: When he when he gets out of bed because it's seven and they get out of bed at this time. Exactly.

00:59:31
<transcript>: he

00:59:34
oetziofficial: I do destructing to give default values to partial keys.

00:59:38
<transcript>: He literally jumps from the top box, and it sounds like the roof is coming down on me is what it sounds like.

00:59:47
<transcript>: Okay, props up her dx? Linter. You can do it domain and type if you prefer. Don't.

00:59:47
<transcript>: param

00:59:49
<transcript>: Params type.

00:59:54
<transcript>: Domain game paramed type.

00:59:54
<transcript>: i don't know

00:59:54
oetziofficial: Destructoring*

00:59:56
<transcript>: I don't know what I would do there.

00:59:56
<transcript>: mark

00:59:57
yeltrah_: @OetziOfficial same

01:00:05
<transcript>: Markos, I know you're right. I just don't know what I would do. How did you generate those pictures of the players? What library did you use for that algebra? The library is called.

01:00:05
<transcript>: michael

01:00:05
marcos_devone: which "Type" is your current type

01:00:13
<transcript>: Michael Walshock, js. No, it's not actually a library. His name is Michael Waltzuck, and he has drawn.

01:00:13
<transcript>: statmen's illustration

01:00:16
<transcript>: Statmen's illustrations for eight years.

01:00:16
<transcript>: eight years

01:00:29
<transcript>: Eight years he's done these illustrations every single day. Here's him on Twitter, see if he subtweeted me recently. So all of these are a different style, obviously. But like every statmese illustration, you see this man drink.

01:00:31
<transcript>: His fulltime job.

01:00:31
<transcript>: just

01:00:33
thdxr: for default values I just do { defaults, ...props }

01:00:35
<transcript>: Just draws statues, illustrate, illustrations.

01:00:35
<transcript>: so that's

01:00:40
<transcript>: So that's how we did it. We hired a designer that we loved. We loved Michael style.

01:00:40
<transcript>: and

01:00:41
<transcript>: And.

01:00:41
<transcript>: he's

01:00:43
algebra97: nice

01:00:49
<transcript>: He's a great guy. That's Michael Waltzuck. I really got to add something to my factory. Everyone asked that question.

01:00:53
<transcript>: Vapor answered the question sorry.

01:00:53
<transcript>: i could have just

01:00:55
<transcript>: I could have just moved on.

01:00:58
<transcript>: Charlie Gun Thursday. Thanks so much. I follow.

01:00:58
<transcript>: i appreciate

01:01:02
<transcript>: I appreciate it also. Witcherness.

01:01:02
<transcript>: i don't know if

01:01:02
texoport: is his bio "js library at statmuse"?

01:01:10
<transcript>: I don't know if I saw that one. Thank you so much for that. Follow gonna type like this. No, not the SpongeBob casing. Not that.

01:01:24
<transcript>: Oh shorten props to P as a standard that would save some typing. I do destructuring to give default values to partial keys. I gotcha etsy. That makes sense. Maybe that's why I used to do it. Maybe that's my smart read.

01:01:24
<transcript>: i'm gonna go with

01:01:26
<transcript>: I'm gonna go with that.

01:01:36
<transcript>: Heart Jeans. Here. Which type is your current type.

01:01:40
<transcript>: For default values, I just do default data. That props.

01:01:40
<transcript>: okay

01:01:42
<transcript>: Okay.

01:01:42
<transcript>: we're

01:01:48
<transcript>: We're doing some type script stuff. People. I feel good. We've already accomplished more than I had Monday through Thursday. Combined.

01:01:50
<transcript>: So now what we're gonna do.

01:01:55
<transcript>: I don't really like seeing that any there. So what I'm actually gonna do is I'm gonna export.

01:01:55
<transcript>: type

01:01:57
<transcript>: Type.

01:02:00

01:02:07

01:02:08
vapor__dev: Don‚Äôt you lose the props preface with that Dax

01:02:19
<transcript>: That's a terrible name, isn't it.

01:02:27
<transcript>: Is that a terrible name? I think it might be a terrible name. Terrible name. Wait. Do I do the brackets? I don't remember.

01:02:29
thdxr: you might not need the any anymor eif TS can infer off your if guard

01:02:32
<transcript>: Okay. So.

01:02:36
thdxr: TRY IT ADAM TRY IT

01:02:36
<transcript>: This one now would just be.

01:02:37
thdxr: WAIT

01:02:38
<transcript>: Did I do that wrong.

01:02:38
<transcript>: no

01:02:40
<transcript>: No, that would just be that right.

01:02:49
<transcript>: Adam try. You might not need the NEA any anymore if TS can infer off your guard.

01:03:00
thdxr: ugh

01:03:02
<transcript>: That doesn't work. Doesn't work. Dax. Euclidean, Fox Box. Welcome to Chat. Good morning, everyone. Website looks cool. Thanks, euclidean. I appreciate that very much. Well, I wasn't really responsible for this. I.

01:03:02
<transcript>: actually

01:03:03
<transcript>: Actually.

01:03:08
<transcript>: If we were to look at these original, I'm gonna pull up the photo. Hang on.

01:03:08
<transcript>: the original

01:03:10
<transcript>: The original.

01:03:10
<transcript>: status

01:03:15
<transcript>: Status prototype that I built eight years ago. I think you'd be surprised.

01:03:15
<transcript>: how

01:03:17
thdxr: wait try `Response[typeof props.domain]`

01:03:17
<transcript>: How similar hang on.

01:03:17
<transcript>: let's open

01:03:20
<transcript>: Let's open this in a new tab.

01:03:20
<transcript>: so

01:03:28
<transcript>: So let's just like, look at a question. Let's just say most points in the game. I think this is the first question I asked on Sam Use when I built a dumb, three month prototype.

01:03:32
<transcript>: And here's the answer. This is what the page looks like.

01:03:37
<transcript>: Let's see how close the original.

01:03:39
<transcript>: The original prototype.

01:03:39
<transcript>: wait a minute what

01:03:44
<transcript>: Wait a minute. What most points in in the game of this season.

01:03:44
<transcript>: i meant in

01:03:49
<transcript>: I meant in a game that's gonna be the hundred by Will. Yeah. Okay.

01:03:57
<transcript>: So let's see if I can find a photo. I don't know. This might take me forever. Actually, I shouldn't do this.

01:04:02
<transcript>: I'm just gonna see if I can find it really, really fast? If I can find it really fast, then we'll go with it.

01:04:02
<transcript>: years

01:04:05
schrew: "The hundred by Will" LUL

01:04:07
<transcript>: Years let's go all the way back to 2014.

01:04:10
<transcript>: 2000.

01:04:17
vapor__dev: The hundo

01:04:18
<transcript>: Sure gap between 2012 and 2016. It's almost like I Photo hates me and doesn't want me to do this.

01:04:19
schrew: Will the Stilt rolls off the tongue

01:04:19

01:04:32
<transcript>: That's so weird. I'm gonna reopen the app.

01:04:38
<transcript>: Here we go. Do we have 2014? No.

01:04:38
<transcript>: that

01:04:41
<transcript>: That is so weird. Can you see this.

01:04:48
<transcript>: Like 2009 out of different camera.

01:04:48
<transcript>: two thousand and

01:04:50
<transcript>: 2009, 2019.

01:04:53
<transcript>: Oh, I'm trying to Scroll.

01:04:53
<transcript>: oh i can't scroll

01:04:54
<transcript>: Oh, I can't Scroll.

01:04:57
<transcript>: And then there's just blank spots.

01:04:57
<transcript>: and then

01:05:00
<transcript>: And then it jumps to 2016.

01:05:00
<transcript>: like

01:05:01
<transcript>: Like, what is that about.

01:05:04
euclideanfoxbox: Matrix broken, your past didn't happen XD

01:05:04
<transcript>: It's really weird.

01:05:06
<transcript>: I.

01:05:12
<transcript>: Wouldn't have had a table. Let's see if I can make the original look like this.

01:05:12
<transcript>: here's

01:05:15
<transcript>: Here's what the original look like, but it's so similar.

01:05:18
<transcript>: So inspect.

01:05:22
<transcript>: We didn't have all the illustrations. Obviously, Walter.

01:05:25
<transcript>: Had not been hired yet.

01:05:30
<transcript>: But a little a little history here. Little.

01:05:30
<transcript>: just

01:05:33
<transcript>: Just delete that and it did have.

01:05:39
<transcript>: Didn't have this.

01:05:44
<transcript>: Well, this might have the table in it. So hang on. Can I not delete, just.

01:05:44
<transcript>: the

01:05:45
<transcript>: The.

01:05:51
<transcript>: So it didn't have any of this stuff. Obviously.

01:05:53
<transcript>: It didn't have.

01:05:55
vapor__dev: Adam just admitted he was in the CIA

01:05:58
<transcript>: I mean, it didn't have a footer either, so I'm being honest. Okay.

01:06:07
<transcript>: So I can't seem to delete just this guy. I just want to delete the chart, you know? Oh, maybe I can. Yeah, I can. Here we go. Okay. It's all gonna pay off.

01:06:07
<transcript>: i'm getting

01:06:09
euclideanfoxbox: true true

01:06:11
<transcript>: I'm getting somewhere, so I'm gonna pay. Nope. That's too much. Undue.

01:06:14
<transcript>: Container.

01:06:18
<transcript>: Yes, yes. Here we go.

01:06:20
<transcript>: This is what the original.

01:06:20
<transcript>: nope nope nope

01:06:22
<transcript>: Nope Nope Nope Nope still not.

01:06:25
<transcript>: Because it would be this stuff. I got delete.

01:06:28
<transcript>: This is a really dumb exercise, actually.

01:06:30
<transcript>: Nobody cares. Okay.

01:06:30
<transcript>: here's what

01:06:39
<transcript>: Here's what the original sat mes look like. Literally. I mean, like this is it basically the chart looks like this. There's no illustrations, but.

01:06:48
<transcript>: The prototype was a big search box. You type in, you get a big chart, that is your answer. So I just worked on a lot of the like.

01:06:48
<transcript>: sequel queries

01:06:58
<transcript>: Sequel queries. Translation like Setch turns natural language queries into database queries. That's what I built originally.

01:06:58
<transcript>: okay

01:07:03
texoport: @vapor__dev psst, don't blow his cover. clandestine ops in the ozarks??

01:07:07
mjewl: melkeyLurk

01:07:08
<transcript>: Okay, moving on. I'm gonna catch up with Chat. Oh, you guys haven't seen anything because you've checked out a long time ago because this is really dumb. I gave you a status history lesson. No one knows what that means is no one cares.

01:07:10
thdxr: try `Response[typeof props.domain]`

01:07:11
<transcript>: The hundred by will.

01:07:11
<transcript>: oh i

01:07:14
<transcript>: Oh, I said, did I say will I'm at will.

01:07:19
oceannn__: Btw if you guys want some good lookin illustration go check https://undraw.co/ this is not mine, just a really good resource for ya projects ;)

01:07:22
<transcript>: Wait. Try response. Type of props. Domain. Okay. Back to real work. Back to real real work.

01:07:28
<transcript>: Try response type of prop domain.

01:07:33
<transcript>: Type of.

01:07:40
<transcript>: Props domain. Okay, type of props domain.

01:07:44
euclideanfoxbox: Oh that's very cool. I don't think iv worked with that database tool before but that is  extremely useful. I might need to look into it for my next project :o

01:07:45
<transcript>: Key cannot be used as index type response.

01:07:49
thdxr: ugh ok

01:07:50
<transcript>: Type T cannot be used to index type response.

01:07:53
<transcript>: So still note.

01:07:53
<transcript>: still

01:07:55
<transcript>: Still no dice.

01:07:56
thdxr: TS isn't as smart as I want

01:07:59
<transcript>: Matrix broken your past didn't happen. Uhoh.

01:08:06
<transcript>: I was in the CIA. Yeah. Apple had to delete those years from my phone after a government request.

01:08:06
<transcript>: wait apple

01:08:11
<transcript>: Wait. Apple doesn't bow those. Do they? Or do they? I don't remember. I feel like they're in the news for one or the other.

01:08:11
<transcript>: don't both

01:08:19
<transcript>: Don't both cover Clanosine ops. Neo darks. Exactly. No one would suspect it. Mj. Will. Injure what's up? There's? Your head popping up.

01:08:19
<transcript>: if you guys

01:08:26
<transcript>: If you guys want some good looking illustration, go check undraw code. This is not mine, just a really good resource for your projects. I've actually seen that.

01:08:26
<transcript>: ocean i

01:08:29
<transcript>: Ocean. I believe I've seen that I don't think.

01:08:32
<transcript>: Four worked with that database tool.

01:08:32
<transcript>: before

01:08:39
<transcript>: Before, but that is extremely useful. I might need to look into it from an X project. Actually, euclidean, if you're talking about lexatch.

01:08:39
<transcript>: it's just

01:08:47
<transcript>: It's just like that's the name internally we use for the software we wrote. So it's actually like a thing that lives inside of Sat news codebase.

01:08:47
<transcript>: we are trying

01:08:51
<transcript>: We are trying to open source stuff because we figure who cares.

01:09:00
<transcript>: And we want to be open and like, and we want people's help. We just love to have people who are passionate about Sat news, help us make it better, because.

01:09:00
<transcript>: we're a very small team

01:09:03
<transcript>: We're a very small team. We have limited resources.

01:09:03
<transcript>: so we are going to

01:09:07
<transcript>: So we are going to try to open source post up anyway. Ts is as far as I want. Okay me neither.

01:09:07
<transcript>: i'm gonna stick with

01:09:08
thdxr: I'm gonna submit PRs

01:09:14
<transcript>: I'm gonna stick with T right there, and then I'm gonna do this omit type, and then I'm gonna change gamera domain here.

01:09:15
intohimos: Just a quick question maybe you know what would be a good way to rate limit concurrent lambda? Or should I just create a proxy for forwarding requests?

01:09:18
<transcript>: Gamera Domain with Box score.

01:09:24
<transcript>: A name is kind of bad I could do.

01:09:24
<transcript>: box

01:09:28
thdxr: @Intohimos you can set a concurrency limit per lambda function

01:09:30
<transcript>: Box scorable gamera domain, but that's so force. So here. I don't know.

01:09:32
thdxr: if that works for you

01:09:36
<transcript>: Type T cannot be used.

01:09:38
<transcript>: Still cannot be used.

01:09:43
<transcript>: Well, now, I broke it. Dax. Now.

01:09:55
<transcript>: Second currency limit per Lambda function. Oh, you're answering me? I'm gonna submit prs. Yes, please. Just quick question. Maybe you don't maybe know what would be a good way to raise let me out. Yeah, that's got you.

01:10:00
<transcript>: Next we broke it.

01:10:00
<transcript>: we

01:10:03
<transcript>: We broke this. That I did. I do something.

01:10:08
<transcript>: Oh, I removed the PGA.

01:10:13
<transcript>: Why wouldn't that work now? Because this one emits PGA.

01:10:17
<transcript>: Right.

01:10:19
<transcript>: My T.

01:10:23
<transcript>: Way.

01:10:28
<transcript>: So like domain.

01:10:36
<transcript>: Does this not work? Okay, I'm going back to the dumb pda. Anything.

01:10:40
<transcript>: Is that at least worked.

01:10:40
<transcript>: let's say never though

01:10:43
<transcript>: Let's say never, though, because never is better than any right.

01:10:43
intohimos: @thdxr tried that, but lambda goes belly up quite quickly. I didn't try to increase the resources though

01:10:49
<transcript>: Okay camera domain. I don't care if this isn't the ideal.

01:10:49
<transcript>: i go

01:10:52
<transcript>: I go back actually just undo under.

01:11:03
<transcript>: The dew structuring. We're gonna get made fun of again. Go back. Just kidding. Back. He didn't make money.

01:11:07
<transcript>: Okay.

01:11:13
thdxr: https://twitter.com/thomasankcorn/status/1634178834462375937

01:11:15
<transcript>: Just like that and then I'm gonna say, this is never just so I don't feel like I have an any in my file because I hear inn's are bad.

01:11:18
<transcript>: Here, annie's, are no good.

01:11:21
<transcript>: I don't want to get subtweeted.

01:11:23
thdxr: I am making people face themselves in the mirror

01:11:23
<transcript>: Okay.

01:11:28
<transcript>: Here we go. I'm making people face themselves in the mirror.

01:11:28
<transcript>: i want to see this

01:11:29
<transcript>: I want to see this.

01:11:32
<transcript>: I want to see this. This tweet.

01:11:46
<transcript>: Holy crap. You're right. Have a sick heart. I guess. Up. Good work, dax. Making people.

01:11:46
<transcript>: evaluate

01:11:48
<transcript>: Evaluate their live choices.

01:11:53
<transcript>: Okay. So now we just need to get our types going.

01:11:53
<transcript>: let's just

01:11:55
<transcript>: Let's just flesh out these types.

01:11:55
<transcript>: i think i

01:11:58
<transcript>: I think I want to do it like this because there is so much.

01:11:58
<transcript>: in each

01:12:09
<transcript>: In each type, this file is just gonna blow up. It's already, like, thousands of lines long, which I heard from theo. That's good. It's good to have big files. So I'm just doing something right.

01:12:10
bronifty: Typo

01:12:12
<transcript>: Because this file is big.

01:12:12
<transcript>: it's

01:12:13
<transcript>: It's a big one.

01:12:18
vapor__dev: big files big checks lez get it

01:12:19
physotronic: let them "cook" bit more and then perma ban them all adamdotdev  Kappa

01:12:20
<transcript>: I pushed if I push a t. A type T in here.

01:12:22
elicxlive: 1k lines D:

01:12:27
thdxr: I'm worried about this generic you're doing right now

01:12:28
<transcript>: Let them Cook bit more and then perma band them all.

01:12:28
<transcript>: my banning

01:12:29
<transcript>: My banning.

01:12:32
thdxr: I don't get it!

01:12:33
<transcript>: Big files, big checks. Let's get it. That's funny.

01:12:33
<transcript>: one thousand

01:12:40
<transcript>: 1000 lines. I'm worried about this generic you're doing right now. I don't get it. Well, okay, so here, dax, please help me.

01:12:42
<transcript>: Gamera Box Score answer.

01:12:42
<transcript>: is

01:12:51
<transcript>: Is gonna be the same no matter the domain. Except for this visual type and even the visual type is only different right here. There's only one.

01:12:51
<transcript>: property

01:13:08
<transcript>: Property nested within all this that changes. So I thought I need to reuse. I thought it'd be nice to just be able to reuse a lot of this boilerplate for the type and just change out the part that the needs to change. Can you help me accomplish that? Does this not need to be a generic.

01:13:14
<transcript>: Dax doesn't get it. Can I actually just do this? I actually might know what to do here.

01:13:17
foobfoob: @thdxr isnt the real cause of this that an object is passed instead of each property as an argument to the func? why foo(props) instead of foo(domain, foo, bar) if there is not a huge amount of arguments

01:13:17
<transcript>: It's doubtful, but I might.

01:13:17
<transcript>: so

01:13:19
<transcript>: So can I just do.

01:13:19
thdxr: idk keep goign and I'll see

01:13:25
<transcript>: I just do this. I don't know. Keep going healthy. That could be dangerous.

01:13:25
<transcript>: let's

01:13:29
<transcript>: Let's see. We'll just try to keep going. We'll just try that.

01:13:32
schrew: You could just do union types, right?

01:13:35
<transcript>: An airtight visual tea requires one type argument. I thought I just fixed that. Oh, no, I didn't.

01:13:42
<transcript>: Okay, visual. And then detail. Oh, geez, did I make details generic already.

01:13:42
<transcript>: there's

01:13:47
<transcript>: There's no detail, no such thing as detail. Okay.

01:13:50
<transcript>: Let's say unknown.

01:13:50
<transcript>: so

01:13:53
thdxr: @foobfoob https://twitter.com/thdxr/status/1623491920054874112

01:13:56
<transcript>: So details an array that in any of the items could be of type those things.

01:14:02
<transcript>: Just do Union types. Oh, maybe. Yeah, maybe.

01:14:02
<transcript>: let's

01:14:02
elicxlive: I take it you prefer interface over type?

01:14:18
<transcript>: Let's just get further let's just get far enough along so if I want gamera PGA box for it let's start with mba if I want gamera I don't this should be PGA. Oh this one just needs to go away if I want NBA box for to look just like this.

01:14:25
<transcript>: Okay. I want it to get all that stuff for free. I can say extends.

01:14:30
<transcript>: Gamera Box Score answer.

01:14:32
<transcript>: At this point.

01:14:32
<transcript>: gamera

01:14:37
<transcript>: Gamera mba Box Score has all of that stuff, right.

01:14:37
<transcript>: all

01:14:39
<transcript>: All this stuff.

01:14:41
<transcript>: Right.

01:14:44
<transcript>: But this is the part that's going to change.

01:14:44
<transcript>: inside

01:14:46
<transcript>: Inside, visual.

01:14:53
<transcript>: But again, it's only going to change a little bit. So what I could do is I could move this up here.

01:14:54
<transcript>: And now.

01:14:54
<transcript>: that

01:14:56
thdxr: ah I get it, makes sense

01:14:59
<transcript>: That does what I want, right? I can control what the visual looks like. Right.

01:15:01
<transcript>: Is that right.

01:15:07
thdxr: that works too

01:15:09
<transcript>: You can do Union types, right? I take it you prefer interface over type. I have no idea, Alex. I actually don't know.

01:15:09
<transcript>: dax

01:15:15
<transcript>: Dax could tell you if one's better than the other or just like Matt Pokecacco on YouTube.

01:15:17
<transcript>: This works too. Is this the way to do it.

01:15:18
foobfoob: @thdxr i dont get from the tweet if that is something you are discussing or thats your opinion :D

01:15:23
<transcript>: So then when I go to visual, I might just have separate visual types. But even visual.

01:15:23
<transcript>: it's like

01:15:23
thdxr: I also don't know lol people keep telling me different things

01:15:27
<transcript>: It's like only this part changes. So I could have like a base visual.

01:15:27
<transcript>: i also don't

01:15:28
ezteq: NbaVisual | PgaVisual | ...

01:15:30
<transcript>: I also don't know. People keep telling me different things.

01:15:31
thdxr: @foobfoob my opinion aka the law

01:15:37
<transcript>: Any visual or PJ visual or. Oh, okay, okay.

01:15:43
foobfoob: and why is that? :D

01:15:45
<transcript>: But I guess at this point here, I know exactly what the visual should be. It should be.

01:15:49
<transcript>: Mba. Visual. Right.

01:15:51
thdxr: don't question the law!

01:15:52
<transcript>: So then up here I could just have.

01:15:52
<transcript>: export

01:15:54
<transcript>: Export interview.

01:15:56
<transcript>: Mba, visual.

01:15:59
foobfoob: damn

01:16:03
<transcript>: Extends visual and then I could just take the detail out of that.

01:16:06
<transcript>: This is this terrible backs.

01:16:09
<transcript>: This terrible to just do it this way.

01:16:09
<transcript>: now

01:16:12
<transcript>: Now, down here, this one.

01:16:12
<transcript>: this

01:16:17
<transcript>: This one has visual NBA visual. And now if I look at my camera mba, Box score.

01:16:25
<transcript>: Right. It's gonna be the right type. Now, is that accurate.

01:16:25
thdxr: idk adam I don't watch sports

01:16:27
<transcript>: That's accurate.

01:16:29
elicxlive: It's one way to do it

01:16:35
<transcript>: It's one way to do it is it the good way to do it.

01:16:35
<transcript>: tell me

01:16:48
<transcript>: Tell me if it's not the best way someone tell me if there's something more efficient like for me to author these because I'm gonna have to dump a bunch of stuff in these, and I'm gonna have to maintain them. More importantly, the author experience will get through here.

01:16:48
<transcript>: hugo thanks

01:16:50
texoport: @foobfoob I'm starting to be swayed by this. I tend to be particularly generous with destructuring and have seen the light on the other side

01:16:56
<transcript>: Hugo, thanks so much for the follow. And Charlie, I think I saw Charlie, but thanks again, Charlie. You get two things. Thank you twice.

01:16:56
<transcript>: starting

01:16:57
thdxr: don't worry I'll submit a PR fixing it once you open source

01:17:00
<transcript>: Starting to be swayed by this. I tend to be particularly generous with destructioning.

01:17:06
<transcript>: It could be a while for you open source stack.

01:17:06
<transcript>: so

01:17:06
<transcript>: So.

01:17:11
<transcript>: Like the nail it right now.

01:17:16
<transcript>: So like here even domain.

01:17:18
<transcript>: Value of this will determine.

01:17:21
<transcript>: What the shape of detail is.

01:17:21
<transcript>: does that make sense

01:17:23
<transcript>: Does that make sense.

01:17:25
<transcript>: Like.

01:17:29
<transcript>: I could do something fancy. Maybe.

01:17:29
<transcript>: because

01:17:32
<transcript>: Because whatever this value is of domain.

01:17:35
<transcript>: Will dictate the shape of this.

01:17:39
<transcript>: I just get over it and just start making this thing work.

01:17:39
<transcript>: i should just

01:17:45
<transcript>: I should just go Adam practical mode, which is what I normally exist in and just get this thing done. How about that.

01:17:51
<transcript>: Bosus, thank you for the follow.

01:17:51
<transcript>: i'm just gonna get

01:17:54
elicxlive: Personally I would use something like this type WithBaseWhatever<T> = { ..., detail: T[] } type NbaVisual = WithBaseVisual<unknown>

01:17:57
<transcript>: I'm just gonna get practical. Time to get practical. This is gonna be an array of.

01:17:59
elicxlive: There's several ways to approach it

01:18:00
<transcript>: Mba Box score.

01:18:03
<transcript>: This one was NHL box for.

01:18:08
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:18:10
<transcript>: So let's actually start making these real.

01:18:13
<transcript>: So I'm gonna get.

01:18:16
<transcript>: Export interface.

01:18:16
<transcript>: mba

01:18:21
<transcript>: Mba Box Score of gamera Yeah.

01:18:21
<transcript>: oh no no

01:18:22
<transcript>: Oh no no.

01:18:25
<transcript>: Mba Box Score details.

01:18:30
<transcript>: And now I'm gonna grab it from over here.

01:18:37
<transcript>: Mba Historical Box score.

01:18:37
<transcript>: oh

01:18:38
<transcript>: Oh.

01:18:44
thdxr: my dog pooped in my house yesterday and he was scared to get in trouble so he tried to eat it

01:18:44
<transcript>: That's not what I want. I want the scheme. I want to do example value. Maybe.

01:18:47
<transcript>: Let's find it.

01:18:52
<transcript>: Might be a little tricky actually with the way things are nested.

01:19:02
<transcript>: Additional prop one. No, this isn't right, okay, this is not what I want to copy.

01:19:02
<transcript>: what i

01:19:04
<transcript>: What I want to copy is.

01:19:08
axllow_: @thdxr NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis

01:19:13

I haven't figured out how I want to package. You know what it is.

<transcript>: it

01:28:29
<transcript>: It's not even that it's. I've really enjoyed the process of filming and editing, and I feel like I'm getting it down. I'm starting to figure out what I want to do stylistically.

01:28:29
<transcript>: what i can't figure

01:28:48
<transcript>: What I can't figure out is what I want to talk about. I just honestly don't know, like, who I am yet. This sounds so cheesy. This is so cringe. I don't know who I am yet is a creator, but I really don't. I don't know, like what I want to make videos about, because I just I've really hesitated to make, like, tutorials. I don't think I'm a tutorial person.

01:28:48

01:29:31
<transcript>: because i don't

01:29:37
<transcript>: Because I don't have a lot of novel thoughts. I might just make stuff that's really entertaining to me.

01:29:44
<transcript>: And hope that other people think it's entertaining might just make stuff like just really dumb, like feet.

01:29:44
<transcript>: i've thought about that

01:29:44
thdxr: make workout videos

01:29:51
<transcript>: I've thought about that. I even started making some and I didn't publish them, so maybe I shouldn't do that. I don't know. Some of the someone told me what I should do on YouTube.

01:29:58
uberrick: feet video, certainly a niche

01:30:00
<transcript>: I've only allowed myself to play singleplayer non online games cause all the others are too addicting. That's a good call. True that's a good way to do it.

01:32:25
<transcript>: i

01:32:35
<transcript>: I don't understand. I don't understand where we went wrong. What is it about developers and our personalities that are so bad? It's the same five jokes told.

01:32:38
<transcript>: 4000 million quadrillion different ways.

01:32:38

stalwartcoder: Not on TikTok *^

01:32:48
imshootex: oh

01:32:51
jammontoast: It's so bad, most "tech memes" suck, thanks for speaking my thoughts exactly.

01:32:54
<transcript>: Like senior developers.com cool collected, and the junior developers freaking out. Like, I've seen that one so many times. I want to pull my hair out. Does anyone else feel that way? Am I just like a jerk? Do I just have terrible joke taste? Is everyone else crack like cackling cracking up, watching these things.

01:32:57
<transcript>: Feet. Videos. Certainly a niche.

01:32:57
<transcript>: hey rick

01:33:04
<transcript>: Hey, Rick, that did sound like I was talking about feet. I was not talking about human feet. I meant like feats of strength.

01:33:09
vapor__dev: the people making them aren't good enough usually so the jokes are way too generic...yeah i said it...

01:33:15
stalwartcoder: Yessss that‚Äôs lame

01:33:16
<transcript>: People love framework versus X. Framework versus white. Yeah. Okay. Wait. What did you say? What did I say? What did I say? What did I say? What are the frogs? What are the frogs mean? I'm sorry. I should know.

01:33:18

01:33:25
<transcript>: What's? It welcome to Chat monk? S. I know. I've seen manka? S a lot. I just don't remember what he means. Does that mean you're sad.

01:33:31
rudixworld: whadup

01:33:32
texoport: I feel like you have really good taste and you need to get more of that into your videos. It doesn't even need to be tech centric imo

01:33:33
imshootex: Scared MonkaS

01:33:37
<transcript>: Because apparently, I'm not good enough to be a twitch partner. No, I don't know. I'll try and get Twitch partner. I will.

01:33:43
thdxr: I thought you had the numbers

01:33:45
uberrick: 100 files changes Senior puts "LGTM" straight away kind of tech jokes

01:33:57
<transcript>: I remember you saying you would create a new neovem theme. Any update on that? Oh, roki, you just totally reminded me. Not just a Neoven theme, just a color palette. I have a color palette that I use now for most of my stuff. If you go to tomorrow FM, Me and dax's podcast, that is the color palette. It's a bunch of bright colors, actually, my website, Adam Dev.

01:33:58
uberrick: @thdxr I reckon he does have the numbers

01:34:03
schrew: monkaS is like "sweating nervous/scared" cause you pronounced "Caique" and it sounded like a not good word

01:34:04
shn4ke: t3ggParty t3ggWave t3ggSip

01:34:07
<transcript>: That's kind of the color palette, like David made a color palette for some project, and I just want to use it on everything. So I want to make a theme based out of those colors. I just haven't done it yet.

01:34:07
<transcript>: but i need to

01:34:08
<transcript>: But I need to.

01:34:17

01:34:17
<transcript>: led zeppelin

01:34:18

But like, I have friends that I grew up with that live here in my area. They're like firefighters and nurses and teachers and teachers. And I thought I just like, I'm gonna teach a firefighter how to write a React app or something. I don't know.

01:35:33
<transcript>: I'm liking it more lately. I'm liking it more lately because I've just kind of got a few friends on Twitter that I enjoy hanging out with, but I see so much stuff on Twitter that makes me angry. Do you feel that way, saying, gee, I hope I've never say anything that made you angry. I probably have.

01:35:33
<transcript>: most

01:35:36
<transcript>: Most of everything I say on twitter's. Not serious.

01:35:37
rudixworld: combining IT and humor compiles to tasteful roasting in most cases

01:35:44
samji3877: nope nothing made me angry o7

01:35:51
<transcript>: Dax, you should see them roast unprepared for Fred. Oh, yeah, I saw that in discord. I mean, I didn't see the Rose, but I saw that. You're gonna do that. I can't wait. That will be good. So, dax, you will nail humor. Okay, maybe this is just speaking to my taste, because I will think whatever you do is funny.

01:35:58
<transcript>: I don't know if I'm just biased or if you're actually a funny person.

01:35:58
<transcript>: and

<transcript>: Style what you do, dad jokes. I do like laugh at that joke. I am a dad, and I can't. I can't hide that. I do think dad jokes are funny.

01:36:38
imshootex: oh oh

01:36:41
<transcript>: Fred. Kiss, dev. Jokes are, by definition not funny.

01:36:47
<transcript>: If he's on Tik Tok not on TikTok.

01:36:48
jammontoast: I have never found anything tech related funny, I think it just isn't my sense of humour, quite often SFW, boo

01:36:57
uberrick: I've found joma videos funny

01:36:59
<transcript>: It's so bad. Most techniques suck. Thanks for speaking my thoughts. Exactly. Oh, you're welcome. Damn. I don't know. It's like this. I could tell you like the five tropes that you will see replayed.

01:37:05
<transcript>: Till the heat death of the universe on TikTok samji thanks so much for that follow.

01:37:05
<transcript>: let's try and

01:37:06
<transcript>: Let's try and list them.

01:37:13
<transcript>: Senior developers are cool and collected, while junior developers freak out over everything. That's why.

01:37:13
uberrick: some of his earlier ones anyway

01:37:17
<transcript>: I can't think of a single another one.

01:37:20
thdxr: the funniest guy I've ever seen is the Microservices guy

01:37:27
<transcript>: There's more. There's more of them. Someone gets to throw out the tropes. What are they? Oh, do we just watch TikTok? I guess we could do that. And I would see the tropes right there in front of my face.

01:37:27
<transcript>: vapor devop

01:37:28
schrew: exit vim

01:37:35
thdxr: KRAZAM

01:37:36
thdxr: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OnoxKotPQ

01:37:40
stalwartcoder: Those jokes are recycled on Instagram as well ü§Æ

01:37:44
schrew: your code relies on some squeaky wheel you should never touch

01:37:47
<transcript>: Vapor DevOps the people making them aren't good enough, usually. So the jokes are way too generic. Yeah, I said it. Yeah. Vapor. I don't know. I don't want to call it a like. I don't want to make personal attacks, but like, just maybe if those are your jokes, maybe just do something else. Maybe not jokes. Maybe in jokes aren't for you. I don't know. There's got to be funny people. Maybe it's joma. I'm excited to watch one of these videos and see if it's actually.

01:37:47
<transcript>: bunny

01:37:49
<transcript>: Bunny.

01:37:51
overra_dev: @thdxr classic

01:37:54
dnbull: im a junior dev and i haven't freaked out and typically don't maybe because of previous career or im just... old

01:37:55
<transcript>: Memes or the funniest. Yes, I do like hyper specific things.

01:37:55
<transcript>: what's up

01:38:07
<transcript>: What's up, Rudix? I feel like you have really good taste and you need to get more of that into your videos. It doesn't even need to be techcentric, in my opinion. So tech support. This is the dilemma. Okay, I'm gonna say this.

01:38:18
schrew: hop on standup, then don't work all day

01:38:20
<transcript>: I I've considered just making YouTube videos that are not related to tech at all because I really want to make stuff on YouTube on YouTube. I feel like I have this. It's a creative outlet that I'm enjoying the editing process to, like, just all of it.

01:38:21
schrew: those are the tropes

01:38:26
jammontoast: @dnbull It is all a load of rubbish, I never freaked out as a Junior either..

01:38:28
<transcript>: But I just honestly, I don't know that I want to be a tech youtuber. I don't know if any of the niches that are well carved for tech people.

01:38:28
<transcript>: are attract

01:38:34
vapor__dev: @thdxr classic

01:38:44
<transcript>: Are attractive to me. Like not that I don't like people who do those that fit in those niches. I enjoy a lot of the creators in the tech YouTube space. It's that I don't feel like I bring anything to any of them. Does that make sense? I don't feel like there's a reason I should be one of those.

01:38:44
<transcript>: and it starts

01:38:48
<transcript>: And it starts making me think, like, maybe I should make you two videos about whatever I want.

01:38:52
<transcript>: I don't know if anyone will watch them, but at least I'd make them.

01:38:55
dnbull: @JammOnToast I think that's mostly young people in their 20s lol. I've seen so much in my life to "freak" out over tech i guess

01:38:56
<transcript>: Scared monkey s.

01:38:56
<transcript>: thought you

01:39:03
thdxr: adam you're funny make funny videos

thdxr: like your teasers in the morning

01:39:10
<transcript>: Put looks good to me. Straightaway. Kind of tech jokes. Oh, yeah, yeah, that's one.

01:39:10
<transcript>: that is definitely one

01:39:13
<transcript>: That is definitely one. I thought you had the numbers.

01:39:13
<transcript>: i reckon he

01:39:16
<transcript>: I reckon he does have the numbers. What are we talking about.

01:39:18
jammontoast: @dnbull Bigger things to freak out about as you get older, for sure.

01:39:19
w3barsi: maybe make a different channel for non-tech vids call it adomnotdev

01:39:22
<transcript>: Monke s is like sweating, nervous, scared. Because you pronounce.

01:39:22

01:40:38
<transcript>: 100 times out of 100. I crake. And thank you so much for that follow. We are taking a little break right now. That's why I'm just staring at you all into your souls. We're gonna get back to writing code. Maybe watching some tech TikTok. I don't know. Apparently, that's what we're gonna be doing today.

01:41:23
formerlyscience: Here from the BirdApp!

01:41:29
<transcript>: Have them learn basic Httml css js to make it a bit interesting, though, I gotta go back to what vapor said. I get to learn to drive the truck. That would be amazing. Actually, I would love to make a YouTube video where Me and a firefighter. His name is Tom Me and Tom.

01:41:29
<transcript>: slop

01:41:39
<transcript>: Slop skills. We learn each other's trades. I get to drive the fire truck. He gets to write some code. That would be amazing. Actually, that sounds like such a good time.

01:41:45
<transcript>: Rudyx combining it and humor. Compiles the tasteful roasting. In most cases.

01:41:51
<transcript>: I think that's right. And that's why dax is gonna have an excellent roast of Fred, and it's gonna be good.

01:41:55
<transcript>: Same gene? Nope. Nothing. They made me angry.

01:42:02
<transcript>: Is being canceled in firefighter, YouTube being canceled or called extinguished.

01:42:11
<transcript>: See, I like that jokes. I like them a lot. I don't know if that's a dead joke, but I would classify that and that sort of category of jokes. And that one was good.

01:42:27
<transcript>: Sock Jenny used to do a dev themed comedy night. Okay, quality dude. Sunil is also great. Three. One. He has some occasional quality humor drops and some great insights perspective. Okay, thank you, sock. There are funny devs. I obviously I'm just not.

<transcript>: That one's good. Yeah. I enjoyed that one.

01:43:20
<transcript>: i think

01:43:27
<transcript>: I think satire. I think that's my sense of humor. I think I just enjoy anybody who's not taking themselves too seriously. And satire seems to fit that that mold.

01:43:28
dnbull: but funny is subjective like music lol

01:43:30
<transcript>: Exit vim.

01:43:31
<transcript>: vimsa jokes

01:43:54

01:44:17
<transcript>: Maybe you're just old. Hop on, stand up and don't work all day. Those are the trips. Yeah, thank you. True. Those are a lot of the tropes dm bowl. It is all a load of rubbish. I never freaked out as a Junior either. Okay, I'm almost caught up. Adam, you're funny. Make funny videos.

thdxr: first thing I watch every morning

01:44:41
<transcript>: I get quite a laugh at laugh out of some of them jam onto's bigger thing is to freak out about as you get older for sure. You know what I think it is? I think the the common theme here is that I just have a bad sense to hammer. I don't think the stuff that gets lots of use is funny and I think the stuff that I do they get no views is pretty hilarious.

01:44:41
<transcript>: so

01:44:44
jammontoast: Same Adam LUL

01:44:50
<transcript>: So I must just have a weird sense of humor. Bigger things to freak out. I already read that one. Maybe make a different channel for nontech bids. Call it Adam Dev.

01:44:52
<transcript>: That's funny.

01:44:52
<transcript>: i like

I haven't seen any of the funny videos on YouTube. I haven't. I'm not being exposed to much. I didn't know that was a word. And I'm so sorry if I was saying it.

<transcript>: So I apologize for anyone that had to listen to me say that word that I didn't know is a word.

01:45:57
<transcript>: i feel like some

01:46:06
<transcript>: I feel like some times I'm so naive and so unexposed to the world that it probably comes off as that can't be true.

<transcript>: I honestly have never heard that word.

01:46:08

<transcript>: Firefox, let's try this.

<transcript>: Now I can do a little something like this.

01:47:43
<transcript>: loop

01:47:49
cowfacedude99: do you have it routed in obs?

01:47:50
<transcript>: Loops. I'm gonna break my audio and it won't work for anything ever again. Probably. But we're gonna try.

01:47:52
<transcript>: Add Firefox.

01:47:55
<transcript>: To the stream audio.

01:48:03
<transcript>: Okay. Here we go. See if it works. Might be too loud. I'm so sorry. Which one should I watch? You may have any recommendations. Oh, my word. I've watched this.

01:48:03
<transcript>: i've watched it

01:48:05

<transcript>: Hang on.

01:48:28
<transcript>: completely

01:48:33
<transcript>: Completely mute. Let's see why doesn't. Yeah, it doesn't seem to work.

01:48:36
<transcript>: I can't use Firefox.

01:48:39
riccro: That's chrome, no?

01:48:41
<transcript>: Or Chrome on this app. I don't know why.

01:48:41
<transcript>: let me

01:48:43

<transcript>: Think for the followup pablo Calm. Do you actually own that domain? Pablo Calm? Because that's pretty cool.

01:49:04

01:49:19
<transcript>: he

01:49:25
cowfacedude99: must be why each time I rick roll you it goes on mute.....

01:49:26
<transcript>: He does kind of look a little familiar, I guess if I if I consider a little bit, if I look at his face.

01:49:26
<transcript>: a little more

01:49:27
<transcript>: A little more.

01:49:27

<transcript>: And give you all the audio.

01:49:37
<transcript>: Oh, let's do this. Let's look at.

01:49:40
<transcript>: My console.

01:49:45
<transcript>: And then let's pull up firefox, and let's see.

01:49:48
<transcript>: Okay.

01:49:53
<transcript>: What channels? It might be coming over when I play it.

01:49:59
<transcript>: So it's coming over something.

01:50:01
<transcript>: Positive.

01:50:03
stinklewinks: hear that

01:50:04
marcusbuer: @cowfacedude99 audio capturing in MacOS is bad... on Windows 11 you can just capture audio from a selected window, don't even need to use virtual audio cables.

01:50:06
schrew: now i can hear!

01:50:06
<transcript>: You don't hear that.

01:50:06
<transcript>: you do hear

01:50:07
imshootex: it works

01:50:11
<transcript>: You do hear that? Okay. So it works on firefox. Okay. Cool.

01:50:16
marcusbuer: it works

01:50:19
<transcript>: Okay, so we're gonna watch this one. I don't know what it is, but we're gonna watch it. Oh, it's too big. It's too big.

01:50:23
<transcript>: Let's go to the page? And let's do? Yeah, there we go.

01:50:24
rohithgilla: We can hear

01:50:29
<transcript>: Here's, people. Here we go.

01:50:31
cowfacedude99: it must not be as bad as linux....

01:50:32
<transcript>: This is an ad.

01:50:36
<transcript>: Trying to catch it up. Okay.

01:50:43
marcusbuer: @cowfacedude99 is is actually worse

01:50:52
cowfacedude99: @cowfacedude99 wait. what?

01:50:54
<transcript>: I will say.

01:50:56
<transcript>: Good production quality.

01:51:00
<transcript>: So very good, productive quality. He's got that going.

01:51:09
<transcript>: Okay. That's a little. Not my speed, but.

01:51:12
jammontoast: is it funny though

01:51:12
<transcript>: This is also very loud.

01:51:16
marcusbuer: For streaming: Windows -> Linux ->  -> -> MacOS

01:51:17
<transcript>: Is it funny.

01:51:22
<transcript>: I'm not really into, like peanut jokes. I don't know. Personally, it's not.

01:51:22
<transcript>: maybe

01:51:34
<transcript>: Maybe we just picked a bad one, too, because I'm sure he doesn't make those kind of jokes in every single. Let's do this one. Apple. I like to make fun of Apple. I'm good with this. He's very good with production quality. So these are like high quality videos.

01:51:38
<transcript>: Very cinematic.

01:51:47
<transcript>: It's gonna be another penis joke, isn't it.

01:51:49
<transcript>: Is it.

01:51:51
<transcript>: No Blinders.

01:51:57
marcusbuer: the OBS port gets progressively worse, and the OSes don't help.

01:51:58
schrew: too quiet!

01:52:00
yeltrah_: Can't hear anything now

01:52:03
<transcript>: It's too quiet.

01:52:13
<transcript>: They've got like a Johnny ives impersonator going here.

01:52:14
fredkisss: cool now

01:52:23
<transcript>: So this is really well done. I don't know how he made this video, like.

01:52:35
<transcript>: It's kind of the Onion style humor. Is that accurate? Do you guys think that's accurate? I think the onions funny. Sometimes.

01:52:38
<transcript>: So when I said.

01:52:50
<transcript>: I was referring to terrible tech humor. I was not. This is not that category. I would not call this terrible tech humor. This is good. I mean, it's good. Satire.

01:52:50
<transcript>: welcome

01:52:52
<transcript>: Welcome aid.

01:52:52
<transcript>: i'm excited

01:52:54

tinydien: what are u eating?

01:53:35
imshootex: you have a camera on a dolly?

01:53:36
tinydien: oatmeal?

01:53:38
marcusbuer: a√ßai?

01:53:39
<transcript>: What am I eating.

01:53:44
<transcript>: Oh, I'm sorry, am I not showing the video right now.

01:53:47
<transcript>: It is oatmeal, Yeah.

01:54:05
<transcript>: So he's nailed the satire. I will say.

01:54:05
<transcript>: this

01:54:09
<transcript>: This particular video. A little slow. I'm still waiting for like.

01:54:09
<transcript>: the big

01:54:12
<transcript>: The big like that was funny.

01:54:13
formerlyscience: Oh hey! I recognize that console! Universal Audio!

01:54:18
<transcript>: It might just not be am I just all be sat there and lay it on thick.

01:54:27
<transcript>: Formerly Science. That's Right. Universal audio.

01:54:39
<transcript>: Okay. I think that's enough of this video. Does it ever like, pick up and make more overt jokes? Maybe.

01:54:45
<transcript>: Oh, here we go. So this person's in washing this video with us this whole time.

01:54:51
<transcript>: Should I get YouTube premium or whatever it's called so I don't have ads put a good idea.

01:54:54
imshootex: yes LUL

01:54:56
jammontoast: Don't buy into it!

01:54:59
jammontoast: LUL

01:55:00
formerlyscience: I have a bit of a studio, I use three x16s and an x8p for A/D.

01:55:01
lithiumx4900: youtube premium is worth it imo.

01:55:10
whatizit: have you seen 'Interview with Senior JS Developer' by 'Programmers are also human'?

01:55:14
marcusbuer: do you mean uBlock?

01:55:18
marcusbuer: Kappa

01:55:22
texoport: @whatizit oh, that video is perfection

01:55:34
imshootex: you picked a movie LUL

01:55:37
<transcript>: Okay, so here's what I would say. My initial assessment of Jometech is I get why he has 2 million followers. He's very good at making videos, like very good at it.

01:55:37
<transcript>: and

01:55:39
<transcript>: And I would also say.

01:55:39
<transcript>: this is not

01:55:41
jammontoast: Youtube premium is worth because they have increased the amount of ads to encourage people to sign up, open your eyes people! Kappa

01:55:46
<transcript>: This is not the kind of stuff I was talking about when I said, all tech humor is terrible. This is pretty good. I mean, like I would find this funny.

01:55:49
<transcript>: Also with say I have not laughed yet.

01:55:54
<transcript>: Like I think he could maybe deliver something.

01:55:54
<transcript>: i don't need

01:56:01
formerlyscience: Ian Coldwater tech humor?

01:56:03
<transcript>: I don't need to tell much. Dude, he's got too many YouTube followers. Who am I? But this video is a little slow, and I'm probably just watching the wrong videos. I'm sure some of them aren't as slow.

01:56:09

<transcript>: We're very into this stuff.

02:00:56
<transcript>: and we

02:01:06
<transcript>: And we all talk a lot on Twitter, and we hang out. And I feel like because of that, we're all too close to it. And that's why a lot of the humor doesn't resonate with me.

02:01:07

sockthedev: are you into dry humour?

02:01:18
<transcript>: Or maybe it's just because the jokes have been done so much it's so many of the same jokes. Maybe that's it. But I'm trying to think is there a parallel, like another subculture that would have a similar experience where.

02:01:18
<transcript>: they all

02:01:21
<transcript>: They all their content is just garbage to them because.

02:01:21
<transcript>: they hear the same stuff

02:01:23
<transcript>: They hear the same stuff over and over.

02:01:23
<transcript>: i don't know

02:01:26
<transcript>: I don't know. Like if you're a professional.

formerlyscience: MUSIC PRODUCTION

02:01:33
<transcript>: Our doctors hanging out on Twitter, like our doctors hanging out and then making YouTube videos. They're like joking about doctor things. You know, I'm saying.

02:01:33
<transcript>: is that a thing

02:01:35
formerlyscience: MIXING

02:01:38
<transcript>: Is that a thing? Why is developer such a weird profession? I feel like we're different in so many ways.

02:01:41
jammontoast: Yea, why do we do that

02:01:42
<transcript>: Vapor. I like cory was not that convincing.

Thanks so much for joining us in Chat. You told me that the scene changed. Just a dismember. The scene will change every seven minutes. It's written into my overlays. It goes to the moving camera. Just add a little spice.

02:03:25
jammontoast: @vapor__dev sigh LUL

02:03:32
<transcript>: So.

02:03:40
<transcript>: I cannot get over how much he looks like my roommate. Oh, my goodness. Maybe he is my roommate.

02:03:43
jammontoast: this is just stupid LUL

02:03:46
<transcript>: So the broll is pretty forced, but like that's kind of part of the humor, I think.

02:03:47
thdxr: we need facial analysis to see how much adam is enjoying it

02:03:56
<transcript>: Someone said, Amazing thumbnail on this one. What? How can I see the thumbnail actually.

02:04:04
vapor__dev: adam with 0 emotion: "this is funny"

02:04:06
<transcript>: Oh, a little. I see that humor. Okay.

02:04:06
<transcript>: next

02:04:09
vapor__dev: MaxLOL

02:04:13
<transcript>: Sock. I think I am in the dry humor. I think.

02:04:19
<transcript>: Okay.

02:04:33
<transcript>: So this I think there are elements that I find funny. It's very unexpected. I did not expect two developers to be spooning and tired and typing that part. Coming up guard. I still didn't audibly really like laugh, I guess.

02:04:33
<transcript>: and i

02:04:39
<transcript>: And I would say his performance. Now this aroll performance is starting to get a little forced for me.

02:04:40

ocelot2123: microservices

02:04:59
<transcript>: But again, like, there's something for everybody. Don't listen to me. I think nothing's funny. Apparently, dax has a link, and I'm gonna see if our friendship is any indication that we think the same things are funny. Here we go. Okay. I do like this guy. Chris. Aim.

02:04:59
<transcript>: i like

02:05:01
<transcript>: I like the microservices video.

02:05:05
ocelot2123: always a classic

02:05:08
<transcript>: Okay. So.

02:05:08
<transcript>: i'm

02:05:09
dnbull: like i said... funny is subjective . its like trying to convince you to like a type of music

02:05:16
<transcript>: I'm gonna like this because I like him. I will say this is another trope. I think is the like.

02:05:25
<transcript>: One developers routine, like as so many people have done days in live videos on developers. And it's always the same nonsense. It's all the same stuff. It's like.

02:05:29
<transcript>: I know your day doesn't look like that. Stop it. Just stop it.

02:05:29
<transcript>: just

02:05:46
thdxr: he was ahead of his time, he did those before all of those videos came out

02:05:47
<transcript>: Just stop. You don't wake up and back and then, like, do your work out and make some mixed berries and like, set at your desk for a little bit. And like, review your day and then like, this, you don't you just don't I know you don't like, I know you don't. So don't make a video about it anyway. Then there's the second trope, which is the making fun of those people that make.

02:05:47
<transcript>: which i'm doing

02:05:49
<transcript>: Which I'm doing some very issue of right now.

02:05:56
<transcript>: She did these. Okay, so dax, as he did these before all those videos came out. Okay, cool. I'm gonna enjoy it more.

02:06:10
<transcript>: I like him.

02:06:11
vapor__dev: i do literally 90% of the stuf in this vid

02:06:21
vapor__dev: and im in nyc

<transcript>: What do we think? Who likes it.

02:07:05
cowfacedude99: am I mad to consider getting copilot?

02:07:06
vapor__dev: seeing adam not laugh at this is causing me pain

02:07:09
jammontoast: It's so positive and intense, yet his day is very miserable, I like it LUL

02:07:11
<transcript>: I like this one better than any other ones we watch. So far I'll say that I think he's earned some credibility for me because.

02:07:11
<transcript>: he

02:07:12
<transcript>: He.

02:07:16
<transcript>: Made the microservices video which I like quite a lot.

02:07:16
<transcript>: see

02:07:25
<transcript>: See I'm seeing I am not laugh at this is causing me paying I don't know if there's anything we'll watch it all actually laugh out loud about.

02:07:25
<transcript>: i'm trying to get

02:07:30
<transcript>: I'm trying to get the last video or the last anything I watched that really made me laugh.

02:07:37
<transcript>: So what I would say about this one.

02:07:37
<transcript>: maybe it's

02:07:45
<transcript>: Maybe it's because I know you are with me and watching. Maybe if I were just able to let go, I would just like, enjoy this more. But it's like I'm picking every little thing apart.

02:07:45
<transcript>: and

02:07:57
<transcript>: And it's this video is such a mix of things that I do genuinely think are funny. Like, that's a funny thing to call out. I love the notice. Like, I just I hate San Francisco culture so much. And I spend a lot of time in San Francisco.

02:07:57
<transcript>: and the startup sc

02:08:05
thdxr: hey that's NYC

02:08:06
<transcript>: And the startup scene there. There are a lot of tropes that I don't think people bang the drum enough on that. I just, like, speak to how much I hate that culture, just so much.

02:08:06
vapor__dev: he's in new york!

02:08:19
<transcript>: So like, notice and insta. And the way people talk about things like that, I find that funny. But then it goes right into something with, like, the security patch thing. And like that was that was forced for me. That just wasn't that funny to me. But.

02:08:19
<transcript>: you got to

02:08:20
thdxr: I think we just like it because this is literally Alan in this video

02:08:25
<transcript>: You got to go with bad can't like every single moment of a video, and I think this is a video I enjoy. I'll say that.

02:08:25
<transcript>: it's

02:08:29
beeut: Hey VoHiYo

02:08:31
vapor__dev: i feel like you're saying you hate me

02:08:35
<transcript>: It's so positive intents, yet his day is very miserable. I like it. Yeah. Okay. That's New York City. He's in New York. I think we just like it because this is literally Allen in this video.

02:08:35
<transcript>: what oh

02:08:37
<transcript>: What? Oh, no. Oh, no.

02:08:38
thdxr: I do

02:09:12
<transcript>: that's like

02:09:19
<transcript>: That's like a thing I learned on some crime TV show years ago. Like people make little micro expressions that tip you off, you know.

02:09:23
<transcript>: Ali Stardev. I'm sure you all have seen this. Let's see.

02:09:23
<transcript>: i have not seen a lot

02:09:25
<transcript>: I have not seen a lot of things.

02:09:25
<transcript>: it's amazing

02:09:31
<transcript>: It's amazing how few things I had seen. I realized more and more every day, how unexposed to the world I am.

02:09:31
<transcript>: you accidentally

02:09:44
<transcript>: You accidentally interview a typescript wizard. I may have seen this already, and I like Matt a lot. So if I don't laugh, that doesn't mean I don't think it's funny. Sometimes I just don't laugh. Okay. Sometimes it's just internal here that I laugh inside.

02:09:50
<transcript>: Okay. I'm just catching up a chat.

02:09:54
<transcript>: Alan, can we talk about how I don't.

02:09:54

vapor__dev: @thdxr i think i can, i think i can

02:11:21
thdxr: adam avoiding commenting on the video directly

02:11:21
<transcript>: I like Matt so much. If I could listen to one person's voice. If I were just, like, not gonna listen music ever again and I can listen to stop it. Stop it. Only thing I can listen to is like a person talking. It would be matt's voice. I love his voice. I could just listen him talk all day.

02:11:22
vapor__dev: adam not laughing: "i love matt so much"

02:11:27
<transcript>: The positive affirmations in the Journal is what I'm imagining Alan doing.

02:11:27

02:12:16
<transcript>: I'm with you, Adam. I haven't laughed yet, but laughed. Your jokes. Dm? Bolt, could you tell me what joke I've made today.

02:12:16
<transcript>: because

02:12:24
<transcript>: Because I get this sometimes where someone says they laughed at something. I said, I don't feel like I'm saying jokes. So then I feel like people just laughing at me.

02:12:29
dnbull: LOL

02:12:30
thdxr: I liked the joke you made of alan's personality

02:12:33
<transcript>: Less so with me. What was the beud? What was wife coming with poker face? Because my wife did bring me this. Oatmeal. Did you guys see my wife again? I'm sorry.

02:12:35
cowfacedude99: the 10 year old tooling that matt mentioned in the video...

02:12:41

02:12:52
<transcript>: i'm also moving

02:12:56
vapor__dev: im hitting every branch on the way down this mornign

02:12:59
<transcript>: I'm also moving to sf in two years. So okay, I'm gonna find I'm gonna say something about matt's video. Fine, fine, fine.

02:12:59
<transcript>: i'll say something

02:13:02
<transcript>: I'll say something about it. Here's what I'll say.

02:13:09
dnbull: maybe the joke is that its typescript? Kappa

02:13:19
<transcript>: Again, I like Matt so much that I just I have nothing critical to say. But what I will say is I really love the idea of this little video. I love the little short form content. I love that matt's making short form content because I just love this personality of his thoughts. Everything about Matt.

02:13:25
thdxr: Adam: I like that matt tried

02:13:30
dnbull: wait i think ive seen this video is this supposed to be "funny" ?

02:13:36
beeut: You said not being able to listen to music and just being able to listen to one person's talking :D

02:13:36
<transcript>: I think it's a hard thing to do to pretend to be somebody else. So I think like whenever I watch Tick, my wife watches a lot of TikTok. And at night, when we get in bed, we'll watch TikTok. And there are people who really good and have done it clearly a lot. The thing where they switch between two views. And it's a different person.

02:13:51
<transcript>: It probably takes a lot of practice, and I'm guessing that's matt's one of matt's first Time's doing that. Okay. So he'll get it with time. But it's really hard to play like, dumb crypto bro when you're not a dumb crypto bro. And I can't help but just watch his performance.

02:13:51
<transcript>: and

02:13:52
cowfacedude99: matt was a guy who used to teach people to act.....

02:13:56
<transcript>: And that's the part that stands out to me. Okay? I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.

02:14:00
<transcript>: You like it match. I didn't say that.

02:14:00
<transcript>: maybe the joke

02:14:05
<transcript>: Maybe the joke is that it's typescript. I'm hitting every branch on the way down this morning.

02:14:05
<transcript>: you're moving

02:14:07
<transcript>: You're moving to San Francisco.

02:14:13
<transcript>: Why in two years, Alan? That's so random. Like, who knows where they're gonna be in two years.

02:14:17
<transcript>: I need to know more.

02:14:17
<transcript>: there's

02:14:20
<transcript>: There's nothing wrong with moving to San Francisco.

02:14:29

02:25:45
<transcript>: Didn't mean it in like a mean way, but was it was a very serious text calling some things out in our family and it got brought up that I'm a robot, so I have no emotions, so I shouldn't be reaction content because when I watch videos, if I think it's funny, apparently I don't laugh. There are things on this stream I've laughed at very hard. They just weren't YouTube videos.

02:25:46
vapor__dev: no do more it was fun

<transcript>: Oh, I see.

02:29:43

02:29:47
<transcript>: And then.

<transcript>: So I make an interface of it.

02:29:56
<transcript>: Details. Name? Okay.

02:30:06
<transcript>: This isn't quite shaped like my example, and it's enough to throw me off. Here what I should do. So.

02:30:11
<transcript>: Let me keep moving, and then we're gonna come back and see if I'm doing this.

02:30:18
<transcript>: So an interface. It'd be a way to do it with an interface as opposed to.

02:30:24
<transcript>: What did I do here? Go back to the type.

02:30:30
<transcript>: Let's go to mba box score detail. Yeah. Okay.

02:30:30
<transcript>: so the way i

02:30:36
<transcript>: So the way I did it instead is without a generic. It's just got it doesn't have that prop.

02:30:36
<transcript>: and then

02:30:38
<transcript>: And then image.

02:30:38
<transcript>: extend

02:30:42
<transcript>: Extends it with the detail, but the other way you're saying would be.

02:30:47
<transcript>: Oh, man, I wish I was smart enough to know the difference. What's better.

02:30:50
<transcript>: Someone just tell me.

02:30:52
<transcript>: If that's objectively better.

02:31:03
<transcript>: Okay. The only reason I would go with my way is that I feel like I kind of know where I'm headed right now, and if I go much further, any other direction, it's gonna take a lot longer.

02:31:03
<transcript>: and i have

02:31:10
<transcript>: And I have to accomplish something to prove something to you all on this stream. I have to actually get something done approve. I don't just get nothing done.

thdxr: https://clips.twitch.tv/DaintyWittyFishGOWSkull-NxVBnetsCiNHmhos

02:34:41
<transcript>: I could even crop more.

02:34:41
<transcript>: i'll crop more

02:34:41
vapor__dev: didn't you hear Dax, reject feedback!

02:34:42
<transcript>: I'll crop more.

02:34:42
<transcript>: i could just scoo

02:34:45
overra_dev: may have been in reference to the other camera view

02:34:46
<transcript>: I could just Scoot over and then I can even move a little bit more.

02:34:50
<transcript>: What do you think about that.

02:34:52
<transcript>: And actually.

02:34:52
<transcript>: let's just do

02:34:54
<transcript>: Let's just do this.

02:34:54
overra_dev: er scene

02:34:54
dnbull: that person is probably on mobile LUL

02:35:02
<transcript>: Okay. I lied. I would not just do this on a whim for anybody that asked. I've actually been thinking I could probably make myself smaller. So let's try this.

02:35:02
<transcript>: now the

02:35:03
dnbull: I think you should leave it as is

02:35:06
<transcript>: Now the problem is I'm gonna move this a little bit more.

02:35:10
<transcript>: Okay, let's get right up to the edge. Set.

02:35:10
<transcript>: right there

02:35:13
<transcript>: Right there oh, Oh.

02:35:17
<transcript>: So close. There it is. Okay.

02:35:21
<transcript>: Didn't you hear dax? Reject feedback.

02:35:21
<transcript>: what

02:35:23
<transcript>: What.

02:35:23
<transcript>: what

02:35:24
alexkates: tell us more about dax being like your wife?

02:35:26
<transcript>: What? There's not much happening on the code. View.

02:35:26
<transcript>: hey

02:35:30
<transcript>: Hey and not miss laughing happening on the camera view.

02:35:35
<transcript>: Ouch. I think we should go for 80% Cameron, Adam and 10% code view.

02:35:50
<transcript>: You guys are funny. Json to ts.com oh, oh, zack, that sounds nice. Actually, I think I can do this pretty fast. Watch, watch how fast I do this. Thanks so much to follow.

02:35:53
<transcript>: Me? Oh, no, I just.

02:35:53
<transcript>: know

02:35:54
<transcript>: Know.

02:35:59
alexkates: JSON to TS vscode plugin is great

02:36:04
<transcript>: O. Arguably. Thank you so much for that. Follow. Tell us more about dax being like your wife.

02:36:06
<transcript>: Alex.

02:36:11
<transcript>: Versus probably on mobile. I think you should leave it as is oh, geez, DM Bowl.

02:36:13
<transcript>: Oh, Geez.

02:36:13
thdxr: adam don't check twitter

02:36:15
<transcript>: I wish I would have read that.

02:36:15
<transcript>: a little bit ago

02:36:18
<transcript>: A little bit ago. Okay. This is just a string.

02:36:21
<transcript>: Same with this.

02:36:27
<transcript>: This is a number. Watch how fast I do this.

02:36:27
<transcript>: this is all

02:36:29
<transcript>: This is all so Nope.

02:36:29
<transcript>: that's

02:36:31
<transcript>: That's a string.

02:36:31
<transcript>: nope

02:36:33
<transcript>: Nope Nope Nope.

02:36:36
<transcript>: String.

02:36:36
<transcript>: and then

02:36:37
<transcript>: And then entity.

02:36:37
<transcript>: this

02:36:40
<transcript>: This is just gonna be a.

02:36:40
<transcript>: oh

02:36:42
<transcript>: Oh, no. What did I do.

02:36:46
<transcript>: Do okay. We're good.

02:36:50
<transcript>: String. I said, I could do this so fast. And then the pressure was on.

02:36:50
<transcript>: so this

02:36:53
<transcript>: So this is a gamera entity.

02:36:56
<transcript>: Away team is gonna be similar.

02:36:56
<transcript>: similar

02:37:02
<transcript>: Similar things string, string, string number.

02:37:05
<transcript>: Oh no.

02:37:05
<transcript>: string

02:37:06
<transcript>: String.

02:37:09
<transcript>: And then this is Gonna be.

02:37:09
<transcript>: gamera

02:37:11
<transcript>: Gamera entity.

02:37:18
<transcript>: Okay. And then this. Watch this, watch this summary. Yeah, that's just a gamera grid.

02:37:18
<transcript>: came

02:37:20
<transcript>: Camera, grid.

02:37:25
<transcript>: Team detail. These are all real. I need to do these.

02:37:29
<transcript>: But they're all basically the same things like this.

02:37:31
alexkates: but also check twitter

02:37:34
<transcript>: Why are these numbers? I mean strings, their numbers.

02:37:34
<transcript>: that's okay

02:37:36
<transcript>: That's okay. I don't care.

02:37:38
<transcript>: I don't care.

02:37:45
<transcript>: Look how fast I'm going. I think these are the same type. I should make a type of them.

02:37:52
<transcript>: I could make this a type right after I just did the work.

02:37:56
<transcript>: Let's just do this. Yank all that. And let's just say.

02:38:03
<transcript>: Export Interface soup. I don't know what it is yet.

02:38:07
<transcript>: What is this? This is like a.

02:38:09
<transcript>: Team detail.

02:38:12
<transcript>: It's like Team stacks. Maybe.

02:38:17
<transcript>: Mba Team Stats will call it.

02:38:19
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:38:19
<transcript>: i'm moving

02:38:21
glamshatterskull: looks like game stats with both competitors

02:38:21
<transcript>: I'm moving now. People watch out.

02:38:21
<transcript>: nb

02:38:26
<transcript>: Nba Team stats. I'm not gonna look at chat.

02:38:26
<transcript>: boom

02:38:29
<transcript>: Boom, just do that. And then what is that.

02:38:32
<transcript>: Grids is gonna be an array.

02:38:32
<transcript>: of

02:38:33
<transcript>: Of game.

02:38:37
<transcript>: That is gonna be a string.

02:38:37
<transcript>: oh

02:38:38
<transcript>: Oh.

02:38:41
<transcript>: Shrink, cool.

02:38:44
<transcript>: String.

02:38:44
<transcript>: and

02:38:48
<transcript>: And gamer grid? Oh, we're done, we're done with NBA.

02:38:51
<transcript>: Watch out, people watch out.

02:38:51
<transcript>: so

02:38:55
<transcript>: So the type is in the historical box score.

02:38:58
<transcript>: Okay. I'm looking at you.

02:39:05
ouwarguii: oh wow, the cinematics

02:39:09
metajezza: Thats a fancy zoom out camera scene

02:39:09
<transcript>: Oh, and I don't look at chat. You guys don't type stuff interesting.

02:39:12
<transcript>: Don't check Twitter with.

02:39:15
<transcript>: Adam, don't check Twitter, but also check Twitter.

02:39:18
<transcript>: Now I have to check Twitter.

02:39:18
<transcript>: oar

02:39:19
grasp5533: Why is Dax like you're wife

02:39:29
<transcript>: Oargully. Oarguy, thank you so much for joining Chat. Welcome to Chat. Oh, wow. The cinematics. Yeah, I've got quite a cinematic view. Glam is here. Looks like game stats with both competitors.

02:39:29
<transcript>: y

02:39:33
<transcript>: Yep. What was it? What I say? Nba team stats.

02:39:33
<transcript>: team

02:39:37
<transcript>: Team Game stance? Yeah, I should call it Team Games that time.

02:39:41
<transcript>: Okay.

02:39:41
<transcript>: team name

02:39:43
<transcript>: Team name, stats? Looks good.

02:39:43
<transcript>: that's

02:39:51
<transcript>: That's a fancy Zoom out camera scene. That's right, meta. What? Welcome to Chat. Why is dax like your wife? Oh, I was gonna tell you why dax is like my wife.

02:39:51
<transcript>: but i don't

02:39:57
<transcript>: But I don't remember. So now I'm just filling the air. Filling the air. What was it saying next? Let my wife.

02:39:57
<transcript>: what

02:40:03
<transcript>: What the hell? No, I'm getting posted on Twitter. Hey.

02:40:03
<transcript>: nice

02:40:05
<transcript>: Nice job. That's a great background.

02:40:05
<transcript>: erin

02:40:07
<transcript>: Erin gets it.

02:40:07
<transcript>: aaron gets it

02:40:10
<transcript>: Aaron gets it. You need something in every corner.

02:40:10
<transcript>: he's got it

02:40:13
<transcript>: He's got it. That's a good background. That is nice.

02:40:13
<transcript>: now

02:40:22
<transcript>: Now let's watch dax's inflammatory clip of me. It's my own fault. Should I do it with audio? Do you guys want to hear it, too? Okay, fine.

02:40:25
<transcript>: No one asked. But okay, fine.

02:40:25
<transcript>: new

02:40:28
dnbull: yeah on full blast too

02:40:30
<transcript>: New window. How do I do it? How do that's? Not that's slack. Why am I? What new index.

02:40:30
<transcript>: full bl

02:40:34
<transcript>: Full blast tube. Oh, boy, there's this one. It's a good one.

02:40:34
<transcript>: by good

02:40:36
<transcript>: By good one. I mean embarrassing one.

02:40:36
<transcript>: here we

02:40:38
<transcript>: Here we go.

02:40:46
glamshatterskull: those are the same ones

02:40:46
<transcript>: I might actually be a robot, so I don't think there's anything I could say in this that would embarrass me. I don't know why I'm not embarrassed by things, but I'm not embarrassed.

02:40:49
<transcript>: Oh, that okay.

02:40:49
<transcript>: well that's

02:40:52
<transcript>: Well, that's it that was.

02:41:04
<transcript>: That was the clip. That was the whole thing. So I never explained why dax is a lot, my wife. And now I can't remember why I said that. I think you just said something. You've reacted to something I said in a way that my wife would react. That's all I meant.

02:41:16
thdxr: that clip out of context makes it sound like in our relationship I'm like the wife

02:41:20
<transcript>: Those are Team Games, apps. We have done it.

02:41:20
<transcript>: we

02:41:20
thdxr: *explains the joke*

02:41:23
<transcript>: We've made mba Historical Box score.

02:41:23
<transcript>: to rena

02:41:25
<transcript>: To rename it like that.

02:41:29
<transcript>: That one goes away.

02:41:31
<transcript>: And then.

02:41:37
<transcript>: The next question is so the type always tells us what shape the thing is.

02:41:42
<transcript>: That useful. It's not useful. It is useful. It's gonna mean it's gonna be very useful.

02:41:45
cowfacedude99: with one string inbetween the interface LUL

02:41:47
<transcript>: Oh.

02:41:47
<transcript>: gotcha

02:41:54
<transcript>: Gotchax I get the joke now that clip out of context makes the same sound like a relationship. I'm like I gotcha.

02:41:59
<transcript>: Yeah that way the way you I see.

02:41:59
<transcript>: yeah

02:42:06
<transcript>: Yeah. No. The. I meant like, your personality is a lot like my wife's personality. I didn't mean like, I don't know what I do.

02:42:06
<transcript>: i just lost chat

02:42:07
<transcript>: I just lost chat.

02:42:10
<transcript>: I do that.

02:42:13
<transcript>: Toby from Switzerland. Thanks so much for the follow.

02:42:18
<transcript>: With one string in between the interface.

02:42:21
<transcript>: What? I put a string between interface.

02:42:27
<transcript>: Are you making fun of how much I've gotten done.

02:42:27
<transcript>: are you making fun

02:42:33
thdxr: also adam I never write interfaces anymore I just define everything with zod

02:42:35
<transcript>: Are you making fun of how much I've gotten done? Cows a cuz you have not seen. I've gotten so much done. We even reacted to some content. We took a break and did some reaction stuff.

02:42:39
thdxr: I'll show you later

02:42:44
<transcript>: Adam, I never write interface anymore. I just define everything with zod. Why is it so obsessed with all? I've never seen anything like it. And the code looks so weird.

02:42:44
<transcript>: like z

02:42:47
<transcript>: Like zdot string optional.

02:42:49
<transcript>: Maybe. Dot. Probably.

02:42:49
<transcript>: not

02:42:52
thdxr: yeah it makes it look alien

02:42:53
cowfacedude99: zod it pretty nice.

02:42:54
<transcript>: Not. I hate it. I hate the way it looks. Maybe I'll get obsessed, too, but I don't like it.

02:42:54
<transcript>: i don't like it yet

02:42:55
<transcript>: I don't like it yet.

02:43:02
imshootex: ze object with ze string

02:43:04
<transcript>: Okay.

02:43:09
<transcript>: So this type right here is going to be very important in a minute.

02:43:11
smilingbig: always have to do things a bit different in js

02:43:11
<transcript>: But right now.

02:43:15
<transcript>: I have enough to make something real. So here's what it is.

02:43:17
<transcript>: Detail.

02:43:19
smilingbig: or I guess ts in this case

02:43:19
<transcript>: Can be.

02:43:23
<transcript>: An mba Box Score Historical Box score.

02:43:23
<transcript>: okay

02:43:24
<transcript>: Okay.

02:43:24
<transcript>: but it also

02:43:26
sockthedev: can i take back my subscription after that zod rant?

02:43:27
<transcript>: But it also can be.

02:43:30
<transcript>: Other things. Okay.

02:43:41
<transcript>: I don't know if you can do that. Can you do a Union like that inside of an array? I don't know if that's even valid.

02:43:48
<transcript>: Or if it's a good idea. But I'm gonna define the next thing that it could be. And then you guys can tell me.

02:43:48
<transcript>: how i should do

02:43:53
<transcript>: How I should do all this. So the next thing it could be is export interface.

02:43:53
<transcript>: gamera

02:43:55
<transcript>: Gamera generic.

02:43:57
<transcript>: Grid.

02:43:57
<transcript>: grid

02:43:59
<transcript>: Grids.

02:44:03
<transcript>: This is another thing. It can be okay.

02:44:06
<transcript>: I think I have this in text, mate.

02:44:11
<transcript>: If I get rid of this detail. So this is the first detail right here.

02:44:11
<transcript>: the next

02:44:15
<transcript>: The next detail is the shape of generic grids.

02:44:16
<transcript>: Okay.

02:44:21
<transcript>: Oh no.

02:44:26
<transcript>: I said that. And then that no.

02:44:33
<transcript>: I just used my mouse.

02:44:33
<transcript>: don't judge me

02:44:35
<transcript>: Don't judge me.

02:44:37
<transcript>: There we go.

02:44:37
<transcript>: so

02:44:42
<transcript>: So this is the other thing. It could be. Well, one of the other things. I think there might even be more.

02:44:42
<transcript>: oh no this

02:44:48
<transcript>: Oh, no, this is awful. It's just grids. It's just gamera. Grid.

02:44:48
<transcript>: okay

02:44:48
sockthedev: adam generally runs 1 year behind. masochist. used to write raw cdk too, when dax was right there with sst.

02:44:52
<transcript>: Okay. So this is another type of a detail.

02:44:57
<transcript>: Like I should say that because.

02:44:57
<transcript>: it helps

02:45:00
<transcript>: It helps me remember why this exists.

02:45:03
<transcript>: The type? Do you see this? The type.

02:45:07
<transcript>: I could have made this thing.

02:45:10
<transcript>: Yeah, we're gonna do it.

02:45:12
<transcript>: Export.

02:45:12
<transcript>: interface

02:45:13
<transcript>: Interface.

02:45:16
<transcript>: Mba team.

02:45:16
overra_dev: i use zod to parse/validate external data (form input, route params, third party apis)

02:45:19
<transcript>: Everything in here.

02:45:25
<transcript>: What's calling me.

02:45:27
<transcript>: Okay.

02:45:29
overra_dev: and get types

02:45:31
<transcript>: So.

02:45:34
<transcript>: This is mba team.

02:45:36
<transcript>: Does that.

02:45:40
<transcript>: All right. So the question is.

02:45:40
<transcript>: if you look

02:45:45
<transcript>: If you look at these, they all have a type. All the details will have a type and the type tells you.

02:45:45
<transcript>: the shape

02:45:47
<transcript>: The shape.

02:45:47
<transcript>: here's the other one

02:45:54
<transcript>: Here's the other one. I just did the grid. Yeah. Okay. So the type generic grids versus NBA Historical box score.

02:45:54
<transcript>: well i actually do

02:45:55
<transcript>: Well, I actually do regret.

02:45:55
<transcript>: resizing everything

02:45:59
<transcript>: Resizing everything, because now my chat is the wrong size. Everything is the wrong size.

02:46:01
<transcript>: Bummer.

02:46:02
sondreal: adamdo8DealWithIt good day sir

02:46:06
<transcript>: Adam generally runs one year behind.

02:46:21
<transcript>: It's true, sock. I used to write a lot of cdk. It took me a long time to get on to ssd, which is a very dumb move because this he's the best soundreals here. Good day, sir. Good day, Sandra.

02:46:23
<transcript>: Okay. So.

02:46:23
<transcript>: this

02:46:28
<transcript>: This. This might actually just be team am I? Every team might have the same shape, but we'll find out.

02:46:32
<transcript>: If type is mba historical box score then I know.

02:46:32
<transcript>: it's one of

02:46:36
sockthedev: calling it. a year from now you'll eventually be writing zod

02:46:38
<transcript>: It's one of these. Is there a way for me to make this easier at runtime. I'll show you what I mean.

02:46:38
<transcript>: so

02:46:41
<transcript>: So now gamer grids.

02:46:43
<transcript>: Detail down here.

02:46:43
<transcript>: where i did

02:46:46
<transcript>: Where I did this. This unknown thing.

02:46:55
<transcript>: Where would I.

02:46:57
<transcript>: What happened.

02:47:01
<transcript>: How did I get here.

02:47:01
<transcript>: what

02:47:02
<transcript>: What.

02:47:08
<transcript>: So.

02:47:08
<transcript>: gamera

02:47:12
<transcript>: Gamera generic grids. This unknown here. I'm just trying to go to yeah, there we go.

02:47:20
<transcript>: Gamera grids. Generic grid detail. So detail. Could be any of these things. Any of these two things? Okay.

02:47:24
<transcript>: Actually.

02:47:31
<transcript>: I don't know if the order ever changes. I think the order is probably always the same and that'll make things considerably easier.

02:47:31
<transcript>: like

02:47:33
<transcript>: Like this is actually what it is.

02:47:35
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:47:42
sockthedev: zod is how you create type safety across unsafe boundaries. it's what closes the gap between fe and be. or be and db. etc

02:47:42
<transcript>: Box word. Then it's the generic grids every time. So I'm just gonna do that.

02:47:42
<transcript>: but the

02:47:47
<transcript>: But the question, I guess, is so it runs time. How am I going to do this NBA visual? So then down here.

02:47:47
<transcript>: this has

02:47:52
<transcript>: This has mba visual. So let's just let's just run through this example in the actual thing. Now.

02:47:52
<transcript>: so here

02:47:54
<transcript>: So here it is.

02:47:56
<transcript>: Get gained.

02:47:59
<transcript>: If League.

02:48:03
<transcript>: What if I did this? What if I said.

02:48:09
<transcript>: What if I said domain is MBA.

02:48:15
<transcript>: This tell me now that Data is an MBA.

02:48:27
<transcript>: Astrophiles get me every time I don't get typescript stuff working in astrophysics.

02:48:27
<transcript>: thanks so much for

02:48:30
<transcript>: Thanks so much for Follow or Lynn the mage.

02:48:44
<transcript>: Calling it a year from now, you'll eventually be writing Zod. You're probably right. Zod is how you create type safety across unsafe boundaries. It's what closes the gap between front end and back end or backend in db, etc. Okay, that sounds useful.

<transcript>: astro

02:48:54
thdxr: you guys are going the wrong route with convincing adam

02:48:58
<transcript>: Astrophiles. It drives me nuts beta, dot.

02:48:58
<transcript>: like i

02:49:03
thdxr: Zod is what cool people use, if you don't use it you're not cool

02:49:05
<transcript>: Like I want to. I want to inspect. I'm gonna look at this thing. And why do I not know? I feel like something works. Data.

02:49:05
<transcript>: summ

02:49:07
thdxr: ^ that's the angle you need to go

02:49:09
<transcript>: Summary. Now see I don't have any type of.

02:49:10
overra_dev: LUL

02:49:15
<transcript>: Dax? Is that your experience? Do you not get any type of.

02:49:15
<transcript>: help at all

02:49:17
<transcript>: Help at all in a natural file.

02:49:23
<transcript>: How does what cool people use if you don't use it, you're not cool. Okay. Good to know.

02:49:23
<transcript>: i'm definitely not cool

02:49:25
<transcript>: I'm definitely not cool.

02:49:30
smilingbig: can you explicitly type data?

02:49:36
<transcript>: You're going the wrong way with convincing me.

02:49:36
<transcript>: it's

02:49:38
<transcript>: It's true.

02:49:38
<transcript>: i do

02:49:38
thdxr: My astro file TS experience isn't great, it does work but feels a lot slower

02:49:42
smilingbig: ah nm I guess you were doing that before nm

02:49:44
<transcript>: I do want to do things to be cool. That's why I type my Tweets undercase now lowercase.

02:49:45
hambonemcglone: @thdxr Same reason Adam switched to neovim?

02:49:46
<transcript>: Can you explain data.

02:49:50
glamshatterskull: i thought zod was just a way for js devs to put off learning rust CoolStoryBob

02:49:51
<transcript>: My astrophile ts experience isn't great. It does work, but feels a lot slower.

02:49:51
<transcript>: that's so weird like

02:49:54
<transcript>: That's so weird. Like. I feel like I should be able to know.

02:49:54
<transcript>: sort

02:49:59
<transcript>: Sort of comps test equals data dot. Oh, here we go.

02:50:01
<transcript>: Here we go. I.

02:50:05
jenswoeste: good afternoon adam. lowercase is good.

02:50:07
smilingbig: noice

02:50:11
<transcript>: Mba visual. There you go. So it knows because I passed mba in. Oh, the power of typescript. Look at the inference people. The inference.

02:50:11
<transcript>: the problem

02:50:13
<transcript>: The problem is.

02:50:18
<transcript>: Thank you for that. Follow.

02:50:20
<transcript>: Good afternoon.

02:50:20
<transcript>: lowercase is good

02:50:25
<transcript>: Lowercase is good. I agree. It just looks cool, doesn't it.

02:50:32
<transcript>: Never mind. I guess you were doing that before. Same reason Adam switched to Neil. Them.

02:50:34
<transcript>: Yes.

02:50:42
<transcript>: I watched prime and it was like, that is cool. I want to do that. I thought zod was just a way for js ads to put off learning rest.

02:50:45
smilingbig: LUL

02:50:46
<transcript>: That was a good burn. Good burn. Glam.

02:50:46
<transcript>: so i can

02:50:48
<transcript>: So I can say visual.

02:50:53
<transcript>: Detail. And I can say Zero. And now look at this fulltype safety.

02:50:53
<transcript>: look at it

02:50:54
<transcript>: Look at it.

02:50:54
<transcript>: well not fully

02:51:00
<transcript>: Well, not fully type safe because I don't know what the back ends gonna say, but if I were using zod, I guess I guess.

02:51:00
<transcript>: okay so now

02:51:03
glamshatterskull: did you customize this nvim? or is it a prebuilt? looks nice

02:51:03
<transcript>: Okay. So now the problem is here.

02:51:03
<transcript>: like okay

02:51:04
<transcript>: Like. Okay.

02:51:07
<transcript>: I need to make separate views.

02:51:10
<transcript>: I need to make separate views for each sport.

02:51:14
<transcript>: Or separate components.

02:51:14
<transcript>: yeah

02:51:15
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:51:17
<transcript>: For each domain.

02:51:17
<transcript>: that's what i'm gonna do

02:51:20
<transcript>: That's what I'm gonna do? So here's what I'm gonna do.

02:51:20
<transcript>: you know

02:51:22
<transcript>: You know this.

02:51:26
smilingbig: I wonder how many people prime got into nvim

02:51:29
<transcript>: Or any of this. I guess I need to come up with the title and all that metadata stuff, but I'll do it later.

02:51:30
<transcript>: Okay.

02:51:37
<transcript>: I'm going to be using grid shortly.

02:51:43
<transcript>: So gamera MBA box where is not assignable site gamer response let's go to game layout.

02:51:43
<transcript>: oh yeah

02:51:45
<transcript>: Oh yeah Astra doesn't let me do that.

02:51:51
<transcript>: So game layout.

02:51:54
glamshatterskull: i'm interested in the upcoming system76 ide

02:51:55
<transcript>: Expects a gamer response this is now gonna be.

02:51:55
<transcript>: a game

02:52:02
glamshatterskull: cosmos or sumthin?

02:52:03
<transcript>: A gamera box score? No. What would this be? What does it need from it? What do we actually use? We use.

02:52:03
<transcript>: data

02:52:05
<transcript>: Data.

02:52:06
glamshatterskull: i forget

02:52:10
<transcript>: Intel G T X answer.

02:52:14
<transcript>: Oh, no? I've broken so many things.

02:52:22
<transcript>: In the upcoming upcoming System 76, ide. Cosmos or something. Oh, I don't know about this.

02:52:22
<transcript>: did you

02:52:28
<transcript>: Did you customize this inventory, or is it a prebuilt? Looks nice. It's all custom. You can find it in my dot files.

02:52:34
<transcript>: Wonder how many people prime got into any of them? Yeah, a lot. Him and TIEGE.

02:52:38
<transcript>: New of them's got a great marketing angle right now.

02:52:44
thdxr: I got teej into neovim

02:52:44
<transcript>: So I've broken.

02:52:48
<transcript>: Lots of things token to HTML.

02:52:50
glamshatterskull: https://news.itsfoss.com/cosmic-text-editor/

02:52:56
<transcript>: What are gamera.

02:52:56
<transcript>: gameran

02:52:57
hambonemcglone: It's all Big Vim industry trying to brainwash us

02:52:58
<transcript>: Gamerans.

02:53:02
<transcript>: Amenos you General Token or Entity token.

02:53:09
grasp5533: I tried watching Prime's neovim video, but my terminal wouldn't print hello in lua, and I gave up lol

02:53:12
<transcript>: Type general that extends the base token text Oh.

02:53:14
<transcript>: We have this already.

02:53:18
<transcript>: This is what I'm calling tokens down below, I think.

02:53:19
smilingbig: I got into vim to look cool while in starbucks

02:53:25
<transcript>: Oh, ma'am, this is a mess. Oh, I just made entity.

02:53:27
<transcript>: Options.

02:53:29
glamshatterskull: @Grasp5533 hahah what term?

02:53:31
<transcript>: And then type.

02:53:31
<transcript>: should

02:53:32
<transcript>: Should be.

02:53:32
<transcript>: oh no

02:53:35
<transcript>: Oh, no. This is gonna slow me down, isn't it.

02:53:38
<transcript>: This is such a mess.

02:53:38
<transcript>: it's

02:53:44
<transcript>: It's such a mess. Look, token. And then token. Again. We have two token interfaces. What.

02:53:48
<transcript>: You even do that.

02:53:48
<transcript>: how

02:53:50
<transcript>: How am I able to do that.

02:53:53
thdxr: the interfaces merge

02:53:53
<transcript>: I.

02:53:54
thdxr: into one

02:53:59
<transcript>: Merge into one. Okay. Well.

02:53:59
<transcript>: they don't

02:54:01
<transcript>: They don't need to because.

02:54:01
<transcript>: that's

02:54:03
glamshatterskull: they just merge or one overpowers the other

02:54:03
grasp5533: I think I was just trying to do a lua.init and have a print statement in it.  In his video when he opens neovim it should run the print statement.  I think

02:54:04
<transcript>: That's the same thing. Okay.

02:54:11
grasp5533: @GlamShatterskull

02:54:13
<transcript>: What I need to do? What is this? This camera spot game response is getting deleted. It's terrible.

02:54:13
<transcript>: i don't need

02:54:15
<transcript>: I don't need it.

02:54:20
<transcript>: So token here.

02:54:30
<transcript>: Where did I head? Another spot. Where? Oh, yeah, here we go. Gammara nlg base token. So type is either general or entity. Okay, okay.

02:54:30
<transcript>: i know what to do

02:54:32
<transcript>: I know what to do, I know what to do now.

02:54:34
<transcript>: Type.

02:54:37
<transcript>: Is oh, no.

02:54:39
<transcript>: Just one.

02:54:42
<transcript>: Yeah, no.

02:54:45
<transcript>: Okay.

02:54:45
<transcript>: this

02:54:49
<transcript>: This is what I want the token interface to look like.

02:54:55
<transcript>: And now I'm gonna go back up here. And I'm just gonna do this. I'm gonna say.

02:54:55
<transcript>: get out of here

02:54:58
<transcript>: Get out of here base token.

02:54:58
<transcript>: oops

02:55:01
<transcript>: Oops Depp Nope.

02:55:06
<transcript>: Yep, and then this one also DAP.

02:55:06
<transcript>: also

02:55:10
<transcript>: Also this one DAP in a detail. Like, what is this.

02:55:15
<transcript>: Are you serious? I've had the entity. Wait.

02:55:17
<transcript>: Oh.

02:55:19
<transcript>: Why did I do it that way.

02:55:19
<transcript>: that's

02:55:21
<transcript>: That's that's silly.

02:55:21
<transcript>: let's just

02:55:22
<transcript>: Let's just do this.

02:55:25
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:55:25
<transcript>: and then

02:55:29
<transcript>: And then export gamer entity is gonna actually.

02:55:31
<transcript>: Be.

02:55:36
<transcript>: Like this. I don't know why I did it this way.

02:55:39
<transcript>: Really silly, silly. But I did it that way.

02:55:39
<transcript>: oh

02:55:42
<transcript>: Oh, I know one thing I might have been thinking.

02:55:42
<transcript>: is

02:55:43
<transcript>: Is.

02:55:47
<transcript>: So I call it gamera token.

02:55:47
<transcript>: yeah

02:55:49
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:55:53
<transcript>: Gamera token.

02:56:06
<transcript>: So one thing I might have been thinking was, now if you if it is type entities, then you know, this is required. Entity is required if it's type entity. So I want to have that type safety. Or I just want to say, Forget it. I'm just gonna say, forget it.

02:56:10
<transcript>: So everywhere we have gamerag token now.

02:56:13
<transcript>: I can say let's see.

02:56:17
<transcript>: Gamera, email.

02:56:23
<transcript>: I can replace with gamera token, right? Oh.

02:56:25
<transcript>: Do you see that? I just.

02:56:34
<transcript>: I Typed all that out and then I just escaped. Nlg token replace with gamera token.

02:56:37
<transcript>: Okay. Okay.

02:56:42
<transcript>: So now entity.

02:56:45
<transcript>: What is this.

02:56:54
<transcript>: There is a type for entity. It is not that.

02:56:59
<transcript>: Gamera entity.

02:57:05
<transcript>: What else? Did I break that's camera token.

02:57:08
<transcript>: Undefined is not a symbol.

02:57:09
glamshatterskull: wat da hek is a gamera token... is there a guiron and mothra one too?

02:57:20
<transcript>: They just merged or one overpowers the other. I think I was just trying to do lua. Net and have a print statement in it in his video when he opens the Onion, it should run the print statement. I think.

02:57:34
<transcript>: Oh, my goodness, glam. You know, you know what gamera is? There is not a Mothro token, but this entire project that I'm replacing is called Mothra.

02:57:36
<transcript>: I'll prove it.

02:57:45
<transcript>: The Mob for Code base.

02:57:45
<transcript>: is

02:57:48
glamshatterskull: we got a kaiju boi in here

02:57:51
<transcript>: Is our Web. Our Web project named after the monster Mothra from Godzilla.

02:57:51
<transcript>: yeah

02:57:55
<transcript>: Yeah, it's all. All of our projects are named after godzilla, monsters.

02:57:59
<transcript>: So mother gamera.

02:57:59
<transcript>: if ta

02:58:01
<transcript>: If tatchi coma.

02:58:04
<transcript>: Nigini.

02:58:04
<transcript>: oh there's a bunch

02:58:06
<transcript>: Oh, there's a bunch of.

02:58:07
smilingbig: awesome LUL

02:58:08
glamshatterskull: gamera vs guiron is one of my faves

02:58:09
<transcript>: Okay. Back to what I was doing.

02:58:11
thdxr: what's godzilla ?

02:58:14
<transcript>: So get URL for entity.

02:58:22
thdxr: like which project is called godzilla

02:58:25
<transcript>: Okay, so in this case, it doesn't know this is the typescript problem. It doesn't know that entity does have a value. If type is entity, is there a way to do this? Quickly, someone tell me.

02:58:27
thdxr: is this microservices?

02:58:29
<transcript>: We don't have a project called godzilla, DAX.

02:58:29
<transcript>: we do have

02:58:34
<transcript>: We do have godzilla ops, which was like a slack bot. We used for a bunch of Op stuff.

02:58:37
<transcript>: Is this microservices? There's like.

02:58:37
<transcript>: there's

02:58:39
<transcript>: There's like two main.

02:58:47
thdxr: macroservices

02:58:50
<transcript>: Projects. There's the front end in the backend. But then we have so many repos for dumb, random stuff. So like, well, we have one for the mobile app we have a repo for.

02:58:57
<transcript>: I built a repo for the profit Bahawall Fame thing. We did the animated thing. That one was called.

02:59:03
<transcript>: Gabra or something. I don't remember.

02:59:14
<transcript>: Macro Services. Yeah, it's macro Services. We just sent a lot of weird stuff at Stapmeus in our years of being alive. Okay, so I want someone to tell me. Zach, you're here.

02:59:14
<transcript>: or marcos

02:59:16
<transcript>: Or marcos, if you're still here.

02:59:16
<transcript>: this right here

02:59:20
<transcript>: This right here. This type. It's general or entity.

02:59:20
<transcript>: if it's

02:59:21
<transcript>: If it's entity.

02:59:21
<transcript>: entity

02:59:25
<transcript>: Entity here is a prop. Otherwise it is not.

02:59:26
<transcript>: How would you do that.

02:59:32
<transcript>: So entity isn't optional. It just only exists when the type is entity.

02:59:34
<transcript>: Someone make that.

02:59:34
<transcript>: type

02:59:36
neochromer: as prime woudl say, enTitty

02:59:36
<transcript>: Type for me show me how.

02:59:41
thdxr: you need to do a union of two types

02:59:43
fitzsimons_dev: two types and extend one

02:59:47
<transcript>: You need to do a Union of two types.

02:59:53
thdxr: let me get the playground out

02:59:53
<transcript>: That's what I had before, isn't it.

02:59:54
stiefbroerikzitvast: get rid of 'type' because if entity != null, it already implies its of type entity

02:59:57
<transcript>: That's what I had before.

03:00:03
<transcript>: Get rid of type.

03:00:11
<transcript>: Yeah. I think what the act is saying is what you're saying. I think daxon fits them in a minor, saying.

03:00:13
<transcript>: We have two types.

03:00:16
<transcript>: One is type general.

03:00:20
<transcript>: It doesn't have an entity. The other one is type.

03:00:22
<transcript>: Entity.

03:00:27
<transcript>: And it does have a type. But can I do this.

03:00:31
<transcript>: Like what's this about.

03:00:31
<transcript>: i need

03:00:32
<transcript>: I need to have a base.

03:00:37
<transcript>: Two types. And extend one.

03:00:41
thdxr: nah

03:00:44
<transcript>: How long does it take typescript experts to get me.

03:00:44
<transcript>: to figure this out

03:00:47
<transcript>: To figure this out, that's the question.

03:00:52
<transcript>: And while dax is in a typescript playground.

03:00:52
<transcript>: riding this

03:00:55
<transcript>: Riding this for me? Do we react to tech content.

03:00:59

jenswoeste: omg - all players have a go pro and are live streaming. every player have their own chat to control whether they fire

03:05:47
<transcript>: A VR setup where a paintball gun shoots you when you get shot. In a video game that sounds fun.

03:05:54
vapor__dev: going from building 1 TS interface to automatic paintball guns is a big jump but let's go for it

03:06:02
glamshatterskull: wait how would that work? like an arduino on every gun?

03:06:03
<transcript>: No Painball does hurt. I paint. Listen, I'm from the ozarks. You think I've never paint bald? I used to have, like, a tip mapman. Like I used to have a gun. Okay, I know it paintball, and they do hurt. We used to crank them up like the psi. Get them real fast.

03:06:06
smilingbig: would you be able to stream that?

03:06:06
vapor__dev: @thdxr coward

03:06:11
stiefbroerikzitvast: i asumed in the ozarks they used real guns

03:06:20
smilingbig: LUL

03:06:29
<transcript>: Going from building one ps interface to automatic paintball guns is a big jump, but let's go for it. I actually love doing stuff with physical like I would love to mess with some actuators. I've done a lot of raspberry pie stuff for my day. I would love to wire up twitch chat to something in the physical world and have some good fun. That would be so much fun.

03:06:32
glamshatterskull: oh i was thinking that chat does like !shoot LUL

03:06:36
<transcript>: Like an arduino. Yeah, we just had to have, like, some minimal mechanism for pulling the trigger.

03:06:39
<transcript>: We're doing it.

03:06:39
<transcript>: would you be able to

03:06:44
thdxr: paintball misses and smashes your $4000 camera

03:06:44
<transcript>: Would you be able to stream that so if it was mobile and we were in an area with cell service.

03:06:44
<transcript>: so

03:06:45
jenswoeste: we could just mount you with a couple of electrodes controlled by channel point redemptions... or bits? LUL

03:06:45
glamshatterskull: yeah!!!

03:06:48
<transcript>: So if we just streamed from our phone.

03:06:50
<transcript>: How would we do that.

<transcript>: and

03:08:56

<transcript>: Unless the guns were electronics.

03:10:01
<transcript>: in

03:10:09

<transcript>: Visual doesn't exist. Are you sure.

03:15:45
glamshatterskull: i don't like blue themes

03:15:52
<transcript>: Are you sure? I feel like visual does exist. Oh, it doesn't because gameracscore has been visual on it.

03:15:52
<transcript>: so i

03:15:52
glamshatterskull: nord is about as blue as i can go

03:16:00

03:16:12
<transcript>: No, I couldn't.

03:16:12
cowfacedude99: `I wish I could get astro working better in neovim.` turned out he deleted too much LUL

03:16:33
glamshatterskull: @smilingbig i would say it's cool... so has blues in it yes

03:16:34
<transcript>: I could just rename this. I.

03:16:34
<transcript>: base

03:16:38
<transcript>: Base. Box order base, maybe. Yeah.

03:16:42
<transcript>: Box for base.

03:16:48
<transcript>: And then the box score is one of the actual Typed ones. Okay.

03:16:48
<transcript>: sure

03:16:49
<transcript>: Sure.

03:16:53
smilingbig: cool

03:16:57
<transcript>: This one can just be deleted.

03:17:00
<transcript>: I don't think I was using it.

03:17:07
<transcript>: Gamer. Maybe about four. Okay, let's go back here and let's say.

03:17:07
<transcript>: it's not

03:17:11
<transcript>: It's not a box or answer. It is a gamer box. Where.

03:17:14
smilingbig: that one looks cool too GlamShatterskull

03:17:15
<transcript>: Nope.

03:17:19
<transcript>: Cool.

03:17:19
<transcript>: well

03:17:21
<transcript>: Well is that nice thing? Don't understand.

03:17:29
glamshatterskull: i like that it has reasoning behind the colors

03:17:29
<transcript>: There's no export. A member. Did I not just name it that.

03:17:29
<transcript>: this

03:17:32
<transcript>: This just lsp restart confidence.

03:17:37
smilingbig: i like snazzy as well

03:17:38
<transcript>: I wish I could get Astro working better in new of him turned out he deleted too much.

03:17:40
<transcript>: Yeah, that was my fault.

03:17:48
<transcript>: Gotta work on my posture.

03:17:56
<transcript>: Did it fix it? No, I mean type is better now, but what's wrong here? Property? Ill do you design? Is this on gamera box for.

03:17:58
<transcript>: Be sure.

03:18:01
<transcript>: Are you sure.

03:18:01
<transcript>: camera box

03:18:06
<transcript>: Camera box score. Nlg does not exist. Oh, because these don't extend it yet.

03:18:11
<transcript>: Extends gamera box or base.

03:18:17
<transcript>: Okay. Now it should work.

03:18:23
<transcript>: Just like restart my lsp every time I make anything.

03:18:26
<transcript>: So visual.

03:18:32
<transcript>: Oh, because visual. Yeah, visuals only on the NBA one right now.

03:18:37
<transcript>: So we got to add.

03:18:43
<transcript>: This is kind of like cheating or just inaccurate.

03:18:43
<transcript>: but i'm gonna do

03:18:44
cowfacedude99: I kind of got stuck on tokyonight.

03:18:45
<transcript>: But I'm gonna do this.

03:18:56
<transcript>: I'll do that for now, even though that's not accurate. I know to come back and fix it.

03:19:00
thdxr: I use tokyonight

03:19:03
<transcript>: This is our we're only gonna get the page working for mba at first, and then I'll come back into the other sports.

03:19:08
<transcript>: Let's be restart. Check again typescript. Check again.

03:19:08
<transcript>: it exists

03:19:09
<transcript>: It exists.

03:19:12
<transcript>: Cool, cool.

03:19:16
<transcript>: Not using any of this yet.

03:19:22
<transcript>: Gamer domain.

03:19:27
<transcript>: That's pretty or not working.

03:19:28
cowfacedude99: you could just do :e

03:19:30
<transcript>: This file.

03:19:35
<transcript>: Think the lsp is a little slow.

03:19:38
glamshatterskull: tokyonight way too blu 4 me

03:19:38
<transcript>: Here's. All that.

03:19:41
<transcript>: Can I safely get rid of all that.

03:19:44
thdxr: I use some variant

03:19:49
<transcript>: Going to.

03:19:52
fitzsimons_dev: I just tried out tokyo night and im stuck on it now. had Been on nightowl for a long time

03:19:53
glamshatterskull: i think nord is like as blue as i can go

03:19:56
<transcript>: Feel good.

03:20:02
<transcript>: So this is the header. And it's good. Now it's better.

03:20:04
cowfacedude99: nord does't have contrast

03:20:05
<transcript>: Now this thing.

03:20:05
<transcript>: data

03:20:06
<transcript>: Data.

03:20:10
glamshatterskull: yeah i don't use it

03:20:12
<transcript>: So this is cheating. I can't do this. It's actually got to be the League.

03:20:14
<transcript>: Right.

03:20:17
<transcript>: Can I actually do that.

03:20:17
<transcript>: oh

03:20:18
<transcript>: Oh.

03:20:19
nesbylol: is the captions from you or some setting in twitch

03:20:32
<transcript>: Jeez.

03:20:35
<transcript>: From.

03:20:35
<transcript>: what's it called

03:20:36
<transcript>: What's it called.

03:20:38
<transcript>: Camera.

03:20:41
<transcript>: Okay.

03:20:41
<transcript>: so that's

03:20:41
cowfacedude99: I did use it for a year but it was horrible when I think of it now.

03:20:42
sockthedev: prettier so borked for me rn in neovim

03:20:46
<transcript>: So that's that so I've got gamera domain. It's a real gamer domain.

03:20:46
<transcript>: and then

03:20:52
<transcript>: And then data the type of data I don't exactly know.

03:20:52
<transcript>: i know

03:20:55
<transcript>: I know it derives from the one thing, the base thing.

03:20:55
<transcript>: okay now

03:20:59
glamshatterskull: this is what i really like about melange "Melange was designed with one idea in mind: Control flow should use warm colors and data should use cold colors"

03:21:00
cowfacedude99: it is probably nice on a website, but not while working.

03:21:00
<transcript>: Okay, now we can start swapping in real data. This is going to be a view specifically.

03:21:00
<transcript>: for mb

03:21:04
<transcript>: For mba. So I'm going to make a component.

03:21:12
<transcript>: Call it NBA Box score.

03:21:14
<transcript>: Okay.

03:21:17
<transcript>: And then.

03:21:17
<transcript>: i'm going

03:21:21
<transcript>: I'm going to just copy all of this.

03:21:21
<transcript>: yeah

03:21:22
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:21:22
<transcript>: right

03:21:24
<transcript>: Right.

03:21:27
<transcript>: Copy all that.

03:21:30
<transcript>: And then I'm going to have to pass in.

03:21:38
thdxr: I use prettierd on neovim

03:21:42
thdxr: way faster

03:21:45
<transcript>: Const data equals Astro props data or something. Oh no. Am I doing the destructor thing that I got? Maybe for export interface.

03:21:47
<transcript>: Property.

03:21:50
<transcript>: Is it properties or probs.

03:21:59
<transcript>: It's prop. Oh, and I don't have to export it.

03:22:02
<transcript>: What.

03:22:09
<transcript>: Actually did I actually break this? Or is it just.

03:22:11
<transcript>: Oh.

03:22:11
<transcript>: never you

03:22:18
<transcript>: Never you use as an interface. That rule really annoys me. I don't care. Okay, so props.

03:22:18
<transcript>: oh geez

03:22:19
<transcript>: Oh, Geez.

03:22:19
<transcript>: oh geez

03:22:20
<transcript>: Oh, Geez.

03:22:28
<transcript>: String or undefined is not.

03:22:34
<transcript>: Just open a random file and then found an issue in it and almost fix it.

03:22:34
<transcript>: that's

03:22:35
<transcript>: That's the problem.

03:22:39
<transcript>: Interface props extends html attributes.

03:22:39
<transcript>: we'll go ahead and

03:22:42
<transcript>: We'll go ahead and do that.

03:22:45
<transcript>: Wish I could just do stuff like import.

03:22:49
<transcript>: Html Attributes this is the kind of thing I can't do.

03:22:49
<transcript>: from

03:22:50
glamshatterskull: #[allow(dead_code)]

03:22:58
<transcript>: From React. Yeah, I can't do this kind of stuff in astrophysics, and it bothers me. I can't just like Autoimport stuff. Reactors, type declaration.

03:22:58
<transcript>: oh it's

03:23:01
<transcript>: Oh, it's not react. What am I talking about.

03:23:04
<transcript>: It's just in a file that had it. Where is it.

03:23:09
<transcript>: From astro Types. I thought I was in a react project for a second.

03:23:13
<transcript>: Well, copilot made me think that.

03:23:18
<transcript>: You guys are talking about prettier.

03:23:25
<transcript>: Nesbal welcome to my channel. Is the captions from you or some setting on twitch. It is from a plugin in my obs.

03:23:25
<transcript>: it

03:23:30
<transcript>: It's a obs plugin that pushes the captions.

03:23:37
<transcript>: Look how much progress I'm making. Guys. I'm really trying. I'm trying really hard.

03:23:39
<transcript>: What is this? What.

03:23:39
<transcript>: before filame

03:23:44
<transcript>: Before filament in box for gamera Gallery ended okay so all these can go away.

03:23:47
<transcript>: And then this.

03:23:47
<transcript>: so

03:23:56
<transcript>: So what you have to pass in to a box score is Data, which is the Shape mba historical box core. Maybe.

03:23:59
<transcript>: At best we'll see we'll find out.

03:23:59
<transcript>: so data

03:24:00
<transcript>: So data.

03:24:04
<transcript>: Maybe I shouldn't do that. Maybe I should just down here.

03:24:04
<transcript>: that's just shaving

03:24:09
<transcript>: That's just shaving some that just saves a bunch of typing. So here data visual.

03:24:09
<transcript>: because it is

03:24:11
<transcript>: Because it is the visual.

03:24:14
texoport: @thdxr with null-ls?

03:24:15
<transcript>: Maybe I want to pass something a little higher up than that.

03:24:15
<transcript>: so

03:24:18
<transcript>: So let's go with.

03:24:19
sockthedev: @thdxr yeah, same, it's been happily running for 2 months now, but today decided to stop working ‚òπÔ∏è

03:24:29
<transcript>: A game box for we're gonna that's what we're gonna import gamera, camera, MBA.

03:24:29
<transcript>: box

03:24:31
<transcript>: Box score.

03:24:31
<transcript>: let's go

03:24:33
<transcript>: Let's go.

03:24:37
<transcript>: I.

03:24:37
<transcript>: can

03:24:44
sockthedev: eslint_d also a solid addition for speed

03:24:46
<transcript>: Can do things like this, and it just works. Oh, this is so good. This is so good. I am so pumped. Data. Visual detail.

03:24:46
<transcript>: zero

03:24:49
<transcript>: Zero dot away team.

03:24:52
<transcript>: Reeve.

03:24:52
<transcript>: but now we're gonna

03:24:52
sockthedev: know you don't lint though dax :D

03:24:56
<transcript>: But now we're gonna do something to save ourselves a whole lot of time. We're gonna say Const.

03:25:03
<transcript>: Awaiting oh, I love copilot so much. Look at that.

03:25:06
<transcript>: First. Let's just do this. Let's just say.

03:25:11
<transcript>: Team, stuff.

03:25:19
<transcript>: Team detail. I don't know what I want to call it yet equals data visual detail. So remember the detail.

03:25:19
<transcript>: has

03:25:19
glamshatterskull: have you tried tabnine adam?

03:25:24
<transcript>: Has two specific things in it grids. And whatever this thing is.

03:25:28
<transcript>: Ox.

03:25:28
<transcript>: core data

03:25:30
<transcript>: Core data. I don't know.

03:25:30
<transcript>: so now

03:25:33
<transcript>: So now here I can do.

03:25:38
<transcript>: Cheat and say that box store data hometeam.

03:25:38
<transcript>: and

03:25:41
<transcript>: And I'm gonna do the same thing right here.

03:25:45
<transcript>: See.

03:25:45
<transcript>: nope can't do it

03:25:50
<transcript>: Nope. Can't do it. Okay. First. I'm gonna delete delete delete delete delete delete.

03:25:52
<transcript>: No.

03:25:52
<transcript>: box

03:26:00
<transcript>: Box score data away team. Okay, cool. So now we have our grids. We have our box for data that's gonna save a lot of typing.

03:26:00
<transcript>: like all

03:26:02
<transcript>: Like all of this.

03:26:11
<transcript>: What is it.

03:26:11
<transcript>: t

03:26:14
<transcript>: T like that.

03:26:19
<transcript>: So if I wanted I'm just a little vim stuff here if I wanted to.

03:26:28
<transcript>: If I'm here and I want to delete everything, including this one behind me, I would do delete capital F like that. Now.

03:26:28
<transcript>: that deletes the

03:26:37
<transcript>: That deletes the actual character. I'm going to do so I want to go to the I'd want to go to the A and say, Delete two bracket. Yeah. Just like that. Just like that.

03:26:45
<transcript>: Okay, so that's our alt and our source. Oh, this is all coming together, people. It's all coming together now.

03:26:49
<transcript>: So the background color.

03:26:52
bronifty: SST looks sick def gonna try it out

03:26:54
<transcript>: What's that? Background color. Oh, that's not related to the team, not dynamic.

03:26:54
<transcript>: this background

03:26:56
<transcript>: This background color here. I'll just make sure.

03:27:02
<transcript>: Have I tried Tab nine? No. What is? Step nine.

03:27:07
<transcript>: Sst is so good. Bro, Nifty.

03:27:07
<transcript>: losing

03:27:10
<transcript>: Losing my voice after a week of streaming.

03:27:20
<transcript>: How are we doing.

03:27:24
glamshatterskull: it's like copilot but free and has a AI element that learns how you code

03:27:26
<transcript>: I feel like I'm neglecting you on actually working.

03:27:32
<transcript>: Okay, so this is a link to the team. I don't know where I'm gonna find that yet.

03:27:34
<transcript>: Is it just like.

03:27:34
<transcript>: in just

03:27:36
<transcript>: In just like in it.

03:27:36
<transcript>: item

03:27:42
glamshatterskull: https://www.tabnine.com/

03:27:44
<transcript>: Item URL. Oh, my, no, I have to get the URL from the entity, so I know how to do that, though.

03:27:49
<transcript>: Url equals get url for entity.

03:27:49
<transcript>: yes

03:27:53
<transcript>: Yes. Hometeamteam entity? Yes. Okay.

03:27:55
<transcript>: And then.

03:27:57
<transcript>: Way team has.

03:28:04
<transcript>: And then this one.

03:28:04
<transcript>: the

03:28:07
<transcript>: The ref here is gonna be.

03:28:07
<transcript>: way team

03:28:12
<transcript>: Way team URL feels good so I still got to do that title.

03:28:14
cowfacedude99: kind of awkward looking at you saying everything out loud while typing on the second cam. LUL

03:28:19
<transcript>: What that title comes from. If they're just taking the name and they're maybe that's just one of the props. We're just gonna do one of the processes.

03:28:25
<transcript>: We'll just do that.

03:28:28
<transcript>: Okay.

03:28:31
glamshatterskull: for charts https://www.tabnine.com/blog/tabnine-vs-github-copilot/

03:28:37
<transcript>: I guess that's actually gonna matter because it's gonna show up in the markup. It's the title. So actually see it right or no, I don't know. I don't know. It's like the hover. Maybe like the hover thing.

03:28:44
<transcript>: So what is Tab nine? It's like copilot, but free, and it has an AI on it. Learns how you code. That sounds super cool.

03:28:49
<transcript>: Kind of awkward looking at you, saying everything out, like typing on the second Cam.

03:28:50
mehulsharmamat: adam I'm gonna be editing together a meme of Prime saying "multi monitors are better" given he's against it and someone challenged me on twitter. Can I have your testimonial lol? Let me know I'll hit record! :D

03:28:55
<transcript>: Oh, when I? When I go to my moving Cam? When I go to my production value Cam.

03:29:04
<transcript>: Mayhu, Adam, I'm going to be editing together a meme of prime saying multimonitors are better given he's against it and someone challenged me on Twitter. Can I have your testimonial.

03:29:08
<transcript>: Let me know I'll hit record so you want me to say.

03:29:08
<transcript>: i'm

03:29:11
thdxr: I'm team single monitor

03:29:19
<transcript>: I'm slow you want me to say that I think they're good even though I think they're bad because I think one monitor is great. I'm team singlemonter but do you want me to say what do you want me to say? I'll say it I'll say whatever you want me to say.

03:29:19
<transcript>: give to me

03:29:26
<transcript>: Give to me. I'm going to my good camera. I need a quick break, but I don't have very long because we're trying to accomplish things. Remember.

03:29:30
<transcript>: Just tell me exactly what let me say and I will say it.

03:29:32
mehulsharmamat: Yep! Just say "multi monitors are better, I agree with Prime"

03:29:38
thdxr: I have less fun when you're accomplishing things

03:29:38
<transcript>: Yep. Just say multimodor's are better. I agree with Prime.

03:29:39
oskrm: "I have 200% productivity with 2 monitors"

03:29:40
glamshatterskull: how you gonna run for president one day if you admit to using one monitor

03:29:43
<transcript>: Okay, but prime okay? But we both think that single is better. Okay, well, whatever we'll do, it. Here we go.

03:29:45
thdxr: he just said it

03:29:46
smilingbig: LUL

03:29:48
cowfacedude99: @thdxr you technically split your monitor. so you are a `dual monitor` guy LUL

03:29:54
<transcript>: I end up. I think I just have my teeth. I've been eating oatmeat. Okay, here we go.

03:29:57
<transcript>: Are you ready? Manga? I'm just gonna assume you are.

03:29:57
<transcript>: multimedias are better

03:29:59
<transcript>: Multimedias are better, okay.

03:29:59
<transcript>: multi monitors

03:29:59
thdxr: @cowfacedude99 how do you know that

03:30:02
<transcript>: Multi monitors are better. I agree with Prime.

03:30:09
<transcript>: And that my friends is how you know everything on the internet is alive. Do I seem convincing? Did I sound so convincing? I was acting.

03:30:09
<transcript>: that was actually

03:30:10
<transcript>: That was actually acting.

03:30:10
<transcript>: everything i

03:30:11
smilingbig: nailed it

03:30:13
mehulsharmamat: OH YEAH babay

03:30:18
glamshatterskull: wow a true thespian

03:30:18
schrew: Disagreeing with the lines you are about to deliver - this is great practice for when all those sponsored streams coming soon!

03:30:21
smilingbig: super convincing LUL

03:30:23
saltyohm: bring out the emmy!

03:30:25
overra_dev: primeagenClap2 primeagenClap1

03:30:25
oskrm: that was the truth. deep down LUL

03:30:25
<transcript>: Everything I say on this here camera is mostly acting. Not really nailed it. Are we good? Okay, cool. I'm going back to my other camera because we really do need to get this stuff done. I'm gonna get this whole page done. You don't believe me? You don't believe me, but I'm gonna do it. And I'm gonna 30 minutes left.

03:30:29
<transcript>: Bring up the enemy or the image.

03:30:36
cowfacedude99: I have been on your stream LUL. @thdxr

03:30:45
<transcript>: That was the truth. Deep down, I used to use like eight monitors. No joke. I could find a photo of my old setup. As my career has progressed, I've used less and less monitors. No joke. I started like my first year as a software developer developer. I had three, and then I went to eight.

03:30:45
<transcript>: and then

03:30:48
<transcript>: And then from there I've just dwindled down till I have one.

03:30:48
<transcript>: there you go

03:30:49
metajezza: Eight monitors what ?

03:30:49
<transcript>: There you go.

03:30:49
thdxr: but in my stream it _looks_ like one monitor

03:30:51
thdxr: doesn't it?

03:30:52
<transcript>: Way team. Okay.

03:30:52
<transcript>: so this

03:30:53
glamshatterskull: i have one monitor on this pc but three on another lol

03:30:55
<transcript>: So this one is gonna be home team probably.

03:30:55
<transcript>: i really hate

03:31:02
<transcript>: I really hate the way prettier does some of this, like the formatting is so hard to read with HTML.

03:31:04
rudixworld: multi cams is much better ... Kappa dramatism ftw

03:31:05
<transcript>: The problem is probably html, though.

03:31:05
<transcript>: okay

03:31:10
fboucheros: even when streaming? or do you use 2 pc?

03:31:10
<transcript>: Okay, so if that's the way team, then this is going to be the home team.

03:31:10
<transcript>: home

03:31:12
smilingbig: I mean I only dev on one monitor, but I have four up atm LUL

03:31:15
<transcript>: Hometeam name and this is going to be.

03:31:20
<transcript>: Home Team url Yep.

03:31:20
<transcript>: and then

03:31:21
aboubacar1855: win + ->  or win + <- is better Kappa

03:31:25
daglee: I like to have 3 monitors, where I turn off 1 when I want to focus.

03:31:25
<transcript>: And then in here, we got to change the name. This is the.

03:31:25
<transcript>: oh wait wait are we

03:31:30
<transcript>: Oh, wait, wait, are we still on a wait team? Oh, we're still on a way team? Yeah, away team.

03:31:33
<transcript>: What was it.

03:31:34
fitzsimons_dev: I have 1 ultrawide curved monitor plus my laptop. How many monitors is that?

03:31:39
<transcript>: Oh, it was the name, right? The full name. Yeah. And this is gonna be a way team.

03:31:39
<transcript>: i see

03:31:42
<transcript>: I see a new chat in my parif.

03:31:46
glamshatterskull: 2.5

03:31:49
<transcript>: As in my peripheral vision. I'm gonna welcome you here in just one moment. I'm trying to focus.

03:31:49
<transcript>: like i said

03:31:54
<transcript>: Like I said perif. Kind of like, no, I got some notice on my phone.

03:31:54
<transcript>: made fun of al

03:31:55
fitzsimons_dev: I have 2.5 monitors then

03:32:01
<transcript>: Made fun of Alan for saying things like that, but. Okay, this is going to be a way. Team Dot record. Yep.

03:32:01
<transcript>: and

03:32:02
saltyohm: all the cool kids say 'periph' nowadays

03:32:03
<transcript>: And then this is like.

03:32:03
<transcript>: way

03:32:04
smilingbig: I probably shouldn't do this though I guess considering I got recently diagnosed with adhd but oh well LUL

03:32:05
vapor__dev: not again ...

03:32:07
<transcript>: Way team dot.

03:32:09
<transcript>: Oh.

03:32:14
<transcript>: Away team dot score. Wow. Okay, that was easy enough.

03:32:14
<transcript>: yeah that

03:32:18
<transcript>: Yeah, that should all be dynamic. Now let me see here. Who is new to my channel.

03:32:21
texoport: @smilingbig welcome to the club xD

03:32:26
mehulsharmamat: Recorded the clip lol, time to find clips of prime saying noncontextual stuff and edit it together lets go lie on the internet

03:32:35
smilingbig: thanks my dude texoport <3

03:32:39
<transcript>: Abu bakr. Welcome to Chat. Welcome, welcome, win plus right arrow or Win plus left arrow is better. What is that? I don't know what that is. Also welcome to Chat F booshrooz, even when streaming. Or do you use two PC? Oh, I'm sorry. So I guess I do use two monitors when I stream. One is a teleprompter, though I feel like that doesn't count.

03:32:39
<transcript>: it's just a

03:32:40
rudixworld: how much "chill time" your other monitors has ... mine is like 99.9% no even cursor there

03:32:41
<transcript>: It's just a teleprompter so I can read chat.

03:32:49
<transcript>: Count. I use one monitor. If I'm just programming, I don't look at anything else. This is the monitor.

03:32:53
glamshatterskull: it 100% counts

03:33:00
glamshatterskull: it's literally a monitor

03:33:00
<transcript>: But in my stream, it looks like one monitor doesn't wait. You're just one monitor. Right next.

03:33:02
glamshatterskull: LUL

03:33:07
<transcript>: Safer. If now, that's awesome.

03:33:08
thdxr: yeah single 5k monitor

03:33:16
<transcript>: Recorded the clip. Time to find clips of primesaying noncatch contextual stuff and edit it together. Let's go live on the internet.

03:33:17
mehulsharmamat: btw for the record - single monitor ftw!

03:33:20
thdxr: I can't wait till we raise a series A, a big chunk is funding more media gear

03:33:23
glamshatterskull: you use it to monitor chat

03:33:35
metajezza: Being used to one monitor is useful to work on laptop when travelling though

03:33:37
<transcript>: A single five K monitor. Same here, dax, for the record. Single monitor for the win. Mayheal we're all on the same team. We're just gonna pretend on the Internet like we're on someone else's team. Thanks so much for the follow. Ruperturio. Rupertorio.

03:33:42
rupertorio: Thank you!

03:33:44
<transcript>: Okay, I can't wait till we rise. A series. A big chunk of funding. More media gear. There you go, dax. That's all it matters.

03:33:44
<transcript>: i thought

03:33:49
<transcript>: I thought it matters. Welcome to Chat as well. Rupert. I think it's probably Rupert.

03:33:49
<transcript>: let's see

03:33:53
<transcript>: Let's see. So let's see if this page works. Now who thinks it works.

03:33:53
<transcript>: does this all say

03:33:54
rupertorio: Can you give a little bit of context

03:33:56
<transcript>: Does this all say pistons and Stuff? Nope. Uhoh.

03:33:56
<transcript>: what i

03:33:59
<transcript>: What I do wrong? Oh, I'm not using this component yet.

03:34:04
texoport: single 4k monitor for work, shitty secondary monitor for twitch streams

03:34:10
<transcript>: Can you get a little bit of context? You mean rupert? You mean context on what I'm doing, or you mean context on the conversation du jour about monitoring.

03:34:11
rupertorio: yes on that

03:34:14
<transcript>: So we need to go into that page, and I need to actually.

03:34:18
<transcript>: Add an mba Box score.

03:34:19
rupertorio: what are you doing in code

03:34:19
<transcript>: And.

03:34:26
<transcript>: Data. Sure. Oh, and that's how safe. Look at that. Because it knows. No, it doesn't. How does it know that that's.

03:34:26
<transcript>: it

03:34:27
aboubacar1855: Are you the creator of statmuse ?

03:34:28
<transcript>: It doesn't know.

03:34:28
<transcript>: oh well

03:34:31
<transcript>: Oh, well, I don't care for now but seems wrong.

03:34:31
<transcript>: okay let's see

03:34:42
<transcript>: Okay, let's see if it works. It worked. Pistons, look at that. So now if I go to different games. No, I should just keep going. I'm just gonna make the whole page. I'm gonna finish the whole stupid page. And then it's gonna be a big grand reveal.

03:34:46
<transcript>: Thanks so much for follow Caglio.

03:34:48
oskrm: HOW DOES IT KNOW? ANSWER ME

03:34:50
<transcript>: I bought your name so badly. I'm so sorry. Everyone.

03:34:51
texoport: @aboubacar1855 the one and the same

03:34:52
thdxr: Adam is the creator of SolidJS

03:34:55
<transcript>: So, yes, on that. What are you doing in code? Oh, we're working on stat muse.com.

03:34:57
<transcript>: Js.

03:34:57
<transcript>: it's so funny

03:35:01
smilingbig: LUL

03:35:06
<transcript>: It's so funny while we're lying on the Internet, might as well say things like that. Yeah. I created Solid js. Before that, I was the creator of view.

03:35:12
<transcript>: No, I know you think evan created that. No, that was me. I'm also Ryan.

03:35:12
<transcript>: i go by

03:35:12
traylortrash84: I run 3 monitors at work, email and teams on one, vs code on one and  live project running on the 3rd. At home I have one ultra wide and a secondary monitor to play twitch/YouTube on.

03:35:16
oskrm: liked your work on React

03:35:24
rupertorio: Yes I know who you are!!! Midudev always talk about you

03:35:26
vapor__dev: dax not gonna like hearing that...

03:35:30
<transcript>: I go by Ryan sometimes kanyado he is the smartest person I think I've ever seen on the Internet. Ryan carneto is I run three monitors at work, email and teams on one vs. Code on one in live project running on the third at home. I have one ultra wide in secondary modified YouTube one so there's nothing wrong with using multiple monitors. I've done it a lot of my career.

03:35:30
neochromer: I

03:35:32
<transcript>: I do think.

03:35:32
<transcript>: i've enjoyed

03:35:35
neochromer: Im also 2 monitor gang

03:35:40
neochromer: 1 is too little especially frontend

03:35:48
<transcript>: I've enjoyed simplifying down to one that said, I'm like using workspaces like multiple monitors and swiping around and all that. So I don't know. Maybe I don't get the benefit of a single monitor anyway. I think prime says single monitor because he has like a really good setup, like like dax does with I Three and all that stuff.

03:35:54
<transcript>: Oh, I'm sidetracked oh got a move in be a boxor here we go.

03:35:54
<transcript>: why

03:35:56
oskrm: 1 monitor gang. you should only focus on one thing

03:35:57
<transcript>: Why does that have errors in it.

03:35:59
<transcript>: Bother me.

03:35:59
<transcript>: so i don't

03:36:02
<transcript>: So I don't get anything done because of lenting.

03:36:05
<transcript>: Or undefined.

03:36:10
<transcript>: Entity? Why is entity possibly undefined there.

03:36:14
<transcript>: I even know what this is. Why am I looking at it.

03:36:17
<transcript>: Not today. Not like this.

03:36:17
<transcript>: moving

03:36:18
<transcript>: Moving.

03:36:21
<transcript>: Here we go. This is the home team.

03:36:21
<transcript>: this is

03:36:27
<transcript>: This is home team home team name. And this is the.

03:36:31
<transcript>: Home team Home team.

03:36:33
<transcript>: You're.

03:36:42
<transcript>: In the image is hometeam team home team dot URL.

03:36:44
<transcript>: Url Yep.

03:36:44
<transcript>: and

03:36:47
<transcript>: And this would be the home team.

03:36:47
<transcript>: a breeze

03:36:49
rupertorio: are you using VIM?

03:36:50
neochromer: !song

03:36:50
<transcript>: A breeze. Look at that copilot nose.

03:36:50
<transcript>: pilot

03:36:52
<transcript>: Pilot knows.

03:36:52
okufa_f: you have a camera slider track?

03:36:55
okufa_f: that's insane

03:36:59
<transcript>: Rupert, are you using them? Yes, I am. I am using them. This is neovem.

03:37:03
sj_se: what chair are you using right now?

03:37:04
<transcript>: And then who else said something.

03:37:06
<transcript>: Song.

03:37:12
<transcript>: That reminds me I want to go back to different music. Just keep replaying the album because I love it.

03:37:17
<transcript>: One monitor, gang, you should only focus on one thing just like me.

03:37:17
<transcript>: i only focused

03:37:18
rupertorio: Midudev always talks about you!

03:37:19
<transcript>: I only focused on one thing.

03:37:19
<transcript>: definitely

03:37:22
<transcript>: Definitely not more than one thing.

03:37:27
<transcript>: It should only be focused on one thing, but I am focused on a lot of things.

03:37:27
<transcript>: home

03:37:29
<transcript>: Hometown url. Okay.

03:37:34

<transcript>: we've now

03:38:00
okufa_f: lol

03:38:01
<transcript>: We've now got.

03:38:10
<transcript>: All of this. Lakers, pistons, the record, the score. That's all dynamic now. So I should be able to change games. In fact, let's just do this.

03:38:13
<transcript>: Let's just do this.

03:38:16
<transcript>: Go to like a different season or something.

03:38:16
<transcript>: or we'll go to

03:38:21
<transcript>: Or we'll go to one of their opponents, Phoenix, and we'll go to, like, the.

03:38:21
<transcript>: recent phoenix

03:38:23
<transcript>: Recent Phoenix team.

03:38:23
<transcript>: here we go

zakhal2: Did you have your larabar today? adamdo8Adambar

03:38:28
<transcript>: Might get the URL.

03:38:34
<transcript>: And then we're gonna make sure our page, the top of it should look just like that one.

03:38:36
<transcript>: It does.

03:38:36
<transcript>: look at it

03:38:40
okufa_f: devon booker vs luka game

03:38:41
<transcript>: Look at it. I mean, the text changes because our nlg just it mixes it out.

03:38:46
<transcript>: Okay. Oh, yeah. Kairi went to the mavericks. That's so weird.

03:38:46
<transcript>: did you have

03:39:02
thdxr: I have a box of larabars on my desk, all peanut butter chocolate chip

03:39:03
okufa_f: the nets fell apart, and kd was on the suns

03:39:07
<transcript>: Did you have your larvae? Zach El. No, I did not. Today's is a pumpkin pie, and I'm really not excited about it. I just. I only like peanut butter chocolate chip. I don't know why we ever buy other ones, but we're out of peanut butter chocolate chip. I had some coming today. A box of them. Actually, Allen, you too, right. We got boxes of Larbars coming today. What underwear brand are you wearing right now.

03:39:08
<transcript>: Great Question, David.

03:39:08
<transcript>: no

03:39:10
<transcript>: No, Actually. Why.

03:39:15
fitzsimons_dev: wait you don't like Lemon?

03:39:16
dalt_kb: You need to do a larabar tier list LUL

03:39:18
smilingbig: LUL

03:39:19
<transcript>: Oh, I wanted to say something when I went to break you probably all saw how much of my legs were exposed. I'm not wearing short show.

03:39:19
fitzsimons_dev: Lemon is pretty good

03:39:19
vapor__dev: i keep refreshing amazon to see when its getting delivered

03:39:33
aboubacar1855: what do you think about microservices @adamdotdev ? I find that the implementation is complicated especially just for scalability. have you worked on some microservices architectures ? and what do you recommend ?

03:39:37
thdxr: so do you recommend the chair?

03:39:39
<transcript>: This chair, this court chair constantly shoves my shorts and underwear up like a constant wedgie. It's just producing a wedge throughout the day. So Casey says my wife come up, she'll come in and she thought I was too hot. So I was pulling my pants up. No, it's the chair. So if I ever do, like, a sideshot of me, because I've got so many cameras going, and you see my legs like I'm just in my underwear.

03:39:39
<transcript>: i'm not

03:39:55
overra_dev: i have the same issue Sadge

03:39:56
<transcript>: I'm not. It's just my pants get pushed up now, at least whoever's here right now, all 139 of you, you'll know, but unfortunately, the next time I go to that view, it'll be like a bunch of people that don't know, and I'm gonna have to say it again. Okay. Do you recommend the chair? I love the chair.

03:39:59
<transcript>: I love it so much.

03:40:04
<transcript>: Devin booker versus Luke. A. Game OOH OOH, Mad Sons. That's exciting.

03:40:05
thdxr: so you enjoy the wedgies

03:40:06
hambonemcglone: yeah we'll know, but we'll lie about it

03:40:08
<transcript>: Devon booker and luca Lucas, something.

03:40:14
<transcript>: Mid duv.

03:40:19
<transcript>: My dude, my dude, Dev always talks about you. Are you talking about me? Rupert? Who's my dude? Dev.

03:40:26
<transcript>: A box of lars on my desk. All peanut butter toilet ship. Oh, sounds so good.

03:40:26
<transcript>: metad

03:40:30
<transcript>: Metadata things folks for that follow. Also bomb G I don't think I saw that.

03:40:30
<transcript>: and fetch

03:40:33
<transcript>: And fetch our queue or Fetch, request requests.

03:40:33
<transcript>: did i see cash

03:40:34
<transcript>: Did I see cash.

03:40:35
<transcript>: cashlio

03:40:36
<transcript>: Cashlio.

03:40:39
<transcript>: Did I.

03:40:43
<transcript>: Lemon is pretty good. Sorry if it's some hard disagree.

03:40:43
<transcript>: hard

03:40:47
<transcript>: Hard disagree on the fruit lara bars.

03:40:51
<transcript>: Alan, you keep refreshing. Amazon. That's so funny.

03:40:51
<transcript>: mine

03:41:11
<transcript>: Mine. Everything that I order comes very late in the day. So it's a bummer. What do you think about microservices? I find that the implementation is complicated, especially just for scalability. Have you worked on some microservices architectures? What do you recommend? I'm not really into them. I'm just not into, like, much in tech about thinking. I just I like to do things. And whenever there's a label for something, that means someone had to think of that label.

03:41:11
<transcript>: i just don't

03:41:22
<transcript>: I just don't think I just do. And that's why anytime I do think it's only when I'm on stream. If I'm like, I want to do something complicated. I just do it on stream where I have smart people in my chat. They can tell me how to do it.

03:41:28
<transcript>: So I enjoy the wedges. Now. I don't. I love the chair. Don't love the way these. I see what you did there.

03:41:28
<transcript>: you kind of backed me

03:41:34
okufa_f: microservices are great, they help with dx

03:41:36
<transcript>: You kind of backed me into a logical conundrum where I said, I like the chair. And I told you that the chair gives me wedges.

03:41:41
<transcript>: US. I must love Weddies. It's not actually the case. Okay, let's keep going.

03:41:41
<transcript>: we're still going

03:41:43
<transcript>: We're still going 20 minutes.

03:41:44
okufa_f: that being said, not all projects need to be split

03:41:53
<transcript>: I'm sure, yeah, I'm sure Microsoft's really great. I just don't know what they are. I'm sure they're good. Don't know what they are? That's most of my tech takes sneak, sneaky, breeks.

03:42:02
<transcript>: Here's what I know. I don't like containers because I hate running docker. I don't like running vms, because I hate doing it.

03:42:02
<transcript>: on a vm

03:42:03
<transcript>: On a VM.

03:42:03
<transcript>: what else

03:42:10
<transcript>: What else do I not like? Mostly it comes down to what do I really dislike? What do I not enjoy doing? And then I just assume it's bad.

03:42:12
thdxr: so do you hate react native yet

03:42:14
<transcript>: So the Brooklyn Nets, in this case are the.

03:42:14
<transcript>: home

03:42:15
<transcript>: Home.

03:42:18
<transcript>: I don't know actually.

03:42:18
<transcript>: where am i

03:42:23
<transcript>: Where am I right now? Where is this? What part of the page is this.

03:42:25
<transcript>: Oh, it's that okay.

03:42:32
<transcript>: Well, we'll just be able to double check and make sure I've got this right. That's the real one. Here's. The fake one.

03:42:32
<transcript>: i got

03:42:36
<transcript>: I gotta make this whole view. I don't know why it's so big like that.

03:42:49
<transcript>: So Brooklyn should be replaced with Phoenix, which is the away team. So was this Brooklyn? Yeah. Okay. So that's the away team.

03:42:54
<transcript>: A Breeve.

03:42:58
<transcript>: And then that means this is the.

03:42:58
<transcript>: way team

03:43:01
okufa_f: @thdxr do you?

03:43:03
<transcript>: Way team away team dot name and this is the.

03:43:05
<transcript>: Way team.

03:43:05
<transcript>: url

03:43:07
<transcript>: Url.

03:43:12
<transcript>: What is it? This is Home team.

03:43:15
<transcript>: Home team.

03:43:18
<transcript>: Name. And this is.

03:43:18
<transcript>: home

03:43:20
<transcript>: Home team URL.

03:43:21
thdxr: I have no opinion but adam is doing a lot of RN right now so I'm curious

03:43:22
<transcript>: And.

03:43:22
<transcript>: this

03:43:24
<transcript>: This is.

03:43:27
stroopwafel26: ohai

03:43:28
<transcript>: Home Team A breeze.

03:43:39
<transcript>: I have no opinion, but Adam is doing a lot of React native right now, so I'm curious, do you hate React native yet? Oh, who you asking? Oh, me, yeah, no idea.

03:43:39
<transcript>: i actually do

03:43:47
<transcript>: I actually do. I've only ever written a mobile app, just native iphone, like with Swift, and that experience wasn't miserable.

03:43:47
<transcript>: it's a sent

03:43:51
<transcript>: It's a sent me zap Actually. So if you check out sat me's on.

03:44:02
<transcript>: The App Store on iOS. That was my work. I mean, there were other people, but that's the only time I've ever done a mobile app, and I quite enjoyed it. Swift was okay.

03:44:02
<transcript>: react native

03:44:05
okufa_f: if you're a startup with limited capital, i feel like RN is a decent option as opposed to splitting work between swift/kotlin

03:44:11
<transcript>: React native kind of frustrates me. I just feel like there's so much between me and what's actually going on that I'm so in the dark about the underlying.

03:44:11
<transcript>: like

03:44:13
<transcript>: Like mechanisms.

03:44:16
<transcript>: Thanks for follow lotti fiber and also.

03:44:27
<transcript>: Get really close to my screen to make sure I can read a letter. Elves and lowercase eyes, you know, but that was all. Walt, thanks so much for the follows.

03:44:27
<transcript>: that was a little

03:44:38
thdxr: do you think it's going to work out or do you want to rethink the approach

03:44:38
<transcript>: That was a little low energy. That was a little bit low energy. Thank you so much for the following. I really do appreciate them. It can start to sound repetitive. I gotta like my camera. I just shook my camera. I just.

03:44:38
<transcript>: freaked out

03:44:42
<transcript>: Freaked out so much it can start to get a little repetitive over the course of a stream.

03:44:42
<transcript>: there

03:44:47
<transcript>: There's some tens of people that follow me, and I start to just sound like.

03:45:06
<transcript>: But I genuinely do appreciate it. I appreciate it because I think you're gonna come back. And I hope that's the case. I hope I see you not tomorrow because I won't be here. But Monday, and every day next week because I'm sure five days a week because I'm crazy. I took a three month break, so I'm very energized right now. Bird bra, thanks so much. I follow.

03:45:06
<transcript>: do you think it's going to

03:45:10
anitrogen: what language or which(if more) do you use the most while working

03:45:11
thdxr: you streaming 5 days a week is hitting my productivity hard

03:45:11
rupertorio: what is sst?

03:45:14
cowfacedude99: once you are done, you can raid prime!!!!

03:45:19
<transcript>: Do you think it's going to work out, or do you want to rethink their approach? Oh, react native. Oh, this is serious time. We're talking serious stuff, dax, I think it's gonna work out. I want to say it's gonna work out because I really want to support Android on day one.

03:45:19
<transcript>: i was so

03:45:30
<transcript>: I was so excited about the idea of this thing working on Android because I've never built an app that worked on Android and statme's people vast for an Android app for literally like six years. So I've always felt bad that we never built it.

03:45:37
<transcript>: So I wanted to work, but then I start wondering, like, I don't know. People praise kotlin. Should we just build two apps.

03:45:40
<transcript>: Just build it native Swift. And Colin.

03:45:46
<transcript>: Quantum dagger Prime.

03:45:48
<transcript>: Good deal.

03:45:48
<transcript>: let's see

03:45:51
<transcript>: Let's see. This is a one. What is that one.

03:45:57
<transcript>: It's the Quarter 1234.

03:45:59
<transcript>: Okay.

03:46:05
<transcript>: So maybe I just should be a one. No, no. And there's a 29. Wait. What is it.

03:46:10
<transcript>: Why is this so weird? Why is my styling look like this.

03:46:14
<transcript>: And this styling looks like this.

03:46:16
<transcript>: I don't understand.

03:46:20
<transcript>: Well, what's different about my markup.

03:46:20
<transcript>: didn't this markup

03:46:22
<transcript>: Didn't this markup.

03:46:24
<transcript>: Let's just look at it.

03:46:24
<transcript>: oh man i'm not

03:46:30
<transcript>: Oh, man, I'm not gonna get the whole page done. Bummer. I did make progress today, though. Can we all admit I made progress.

03:46:30
<transcript>: it

03:46:31
cowfacedude99: something does not look right with the columns LUL

03:46:33
<transcript>: It wasn't a total disaster.

03:46:38
<transcript>: Something does not look right with the columns. Yes, I agree.

03:46:39
rupertorio: Yes you made progress

03:46:45
<transcript>: Oh, sorry, dax. My streaming. Five days. We killing your productivity.

03:46:50
<transcript>: I do wonder sometimes when I'm watching streams, if I'm as productive.

03:46:52
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:46:52
jenswoeste: it wasnt a TOTAL disaster. LUL

03:46:53
traylortrash84: SeemsGood

03:46:58
<transcript>: This is the what looks wrong here. First, flex, one.

03:46:58
<transcript>: it looks like

03:47:00
<transcript>: It looks like some special class on this.

03:47:02
<transcript>: Maybe.

03:47:11
<transcript>: Cronism.

03:47:15
<transcript>: I feel like I just nailed a pretty complicated name immediately.

03:47:22
<transcript>: It wasn't a total disaster, says yens. Rupert says. I made progress.

03:47:25
<transcript>: Trailer gives me the thumbs up.

03:47:28
<transcript>: Thank you for that. Follow.

03:47:35
<transcript>: I feel like you just want me to say your name. I feel like you changed your name just so I have to say it. Pofartato.

03:47:39
<transcript>: Is that actually was that your name before.

03:47:39
<transcript>: or did

03:47:42
<transcript>: Or did you just want to see if I could nail another hard name.

03:47:42
<transcript>: sometimes i feel like

03:47:44
<transcript>: Sometimes I feel like I'm being tested.

03:47:48
<transcript>: Hofartato, it's like a potato.

03:47:51
<transcript>: Kind of.

03:47:51
<transcript>: funny

03:47:52
<transcript>: Funny.

03:47:55
<transcript>: Okay.

03:47:55
<transcript>: i

03:47:59
<transcript>: I still don't see that I don't see why mine would be different here.

03:48:01
pofartato: No it was

03:48:03
<transcript>: Base White sprite. These are all normal.

03:48:03
<transcript>: tail

03:48:04
<transcript>: Tail in classes.

03:48:08
<transcript>: I thought maybe there was a.

03:48:10
<transcript>: No, it wasn't okay.

03:48:10
<transcript>: welcome to chat

03:48:12
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat as well. Poeflato.

03:48:12
<transcript>: welcome

03:48:14
<transcript>: Welcome, welcome.

03:48:21
rupertorio: what is sst?

03:48:21
<transcript>: I can't figure out why.

03:48:24
<transcript>: Let's look at, let's look at ours. Now.

03:48:24
<transcript>: and see if

03:48:28
<transcript>: And see if something looks off. Oh, it's probably white space, honestly.

03:48:32
<transcript>: So this is something that drives me crazy about.

03:48:35
<transcript>: Yeah. See that white space.

03:48:35
<transcript>: this drives me

03:48:41
<transcript>: This drives me absolutely bockers about I don't know if it's astro. I don't think it's astro's fault.

03:48:41
<transcript>: as i

03:48:49
<transcript>: As I love astro, and I doubt it would be as result. But the white space is preserved. I think it's prettier. I blame prettier.

03:48:49
<transcript>: watch this

03:48:50
<transcript>: Watch this.

03:48:53
<transcript>: See that.

03:48:53
<transcript>: it's the

03:48:58
<transcript>: It's the white space. It's like this file preserves all the whitespace.

03:48:58
<transcript>: who it feels

03:49:00
<transcript>: Who it feels bad.

03:49:00
thdxr: https://sst.dev

03:49:03
<transcript>: Feels real bad.

03:49:03
<transcript>: where was

03:49:06
<transcript>: Where was that? Like right here. This should just be.

03:49:08
thdxr: at this point should add a fossabot command lol

03:49:12
<transcript>: Like this. You see. And then it does that.

03:49:14
<transcript>: What was the answer.

03:49:14
<transcript>: who knows

03:49:15
<transcript>: Who knows.

03:49:16
okufa_f: if discord can run on react native, i feel like a majority of apps out there can too

03:49:20
<transcript>: Oh, we should definitely add a fossil bot command for SST.

03:49:22
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:49:22
<transcript>: i mean

03:49:24
<transcript>: I mean Ragnae is great.

03:49:24
<transcript>: and

03:49:31
jenswoeste: CRLF => whitespace? idk

03:49:41
<transcript>: And you're right. If, well, if discord can't. I don't know what we're building. What me and docs are building. Rebates TV. It's literally a live video feed with a whole bunch of animations. So it's kind of like the worst possible scenario for a mobile app. I feel like in terms of performance and making sure.

03:49:42
overra_dev: is it like HQ trivia?

03:49:43
<transcript>: You're optimizing everything.

03:49:47
okufa_f: oh yeah, that might run into some issues

03:49:47
ezteq: remove whitespace-pre

03:49:47
<transcript>: Crlf to whitespace. I don't know.

03:49:47
<transcript>: it's

03:49:50
<transcript>: It's like hp Tribute exactly over.

03:49:50
<transcript>: it's h

03:49:55
thdxr: and it's also small scope so code reuse isn't as useful compared to a giant app like discord

03:49:56
<transcript>: It's hq trivia, but for devs so that's I do feel like we have a use case that's kind of like uniquely.

03:49:56
<transcript>: bad

03:49:58
overra_dev: sweet

03:49:58
<transcript>: Bad for.

03:50:02
<transcript>: Back native.

03:50:02
<transcript>: team can i just

03:50:04
<transcript>: Team. Can I just do this.

03:50:06
<transcript>: Does that work.

03:50:10
traylortrash84: Is whitespace-pre on 57 not the cause?

03:50:11
<transcript>: Oh team is not.

03:50:19
<transcript>: Oh, does that have to be like a string? What that? Text team.

03:50:22
<transcript>: Trout. That.

03:50:27
<transcript>: Name.

03:50:30
<transcript>: What's from.

03:50:32
<transcript>: Team is not defined.

03:50:36
<transcript>: I'll see a problem.

03:50:36
<transcript>: i bet

03:50:37
<transcript>: I bet.

03:50:39
traylortrash84: 58

03:50:40
<transcript>: Does this need to be like.

03:50:40
<transcript>: oh

03:50:41
traylortrash84: ^

03:50:45
<transcript>: Oh, here we go. Ysa quote like that.

03:50:49
<transcript>: We did it.

03:50:49
<transcript>: so i'm just gonna do

03:50:54
<transcript>: So I'm just gonna do that. I'm gonna do set text when I want to not have white face. It just seems like I shouldn't have to do that, you know.

03:51:00
<transcript>: Seems like I shouldn't have to do that. I guess I'll have to do it for this one, too.

03:51:03
<transcript>: At. Text.

03:51:05
<transcript>: Way team.

03:51:07
<transcript>: What will eat.

03:51:10
<transcript>: A Beriv.

03:51:16
<transcript>: I think that's gonna work. At least I just don't know why I have to do it.

03:51:19
<transcript>: Set, text.

03:51:23
<transcript>: Home. Here we go.

03:51:25
<transcript>: Here we go.

03:51:30
<transcript>: Did. I did it.

03:51:30
<transcript>: nailed it

03:51:32
<transcript>: Nailed it. Even.

03:51:38
<transcript>: Did we fix it? I still got to do it around all the other stuff, but, whoa, what's going on with his hair.

03:51:42
<transcript>: What is that.

03:51:44
overra_dev: LUL

03:51:46
<transcript>: And someone tell me what that is.

03:51:49
jenswoeste: LUL

03:51:49
<transcript>: What's on his head.

03:51:51
ezteq: removing whitespace-pre would solve it jn the right way üòÇ

03:51:58
<transcript>: Thanks so much milkshake. Removing whitespace pre would solve it in the right way.

03:52:01
<transcript>: White space pre oh, for real.

03:52:02
jenswoeste: what happens to males in the late 30'ies

03:52:05
<transcript>: Is that the cause.

03:52:12
<transcript>: What happens? The males in the late thirty s. I don't think that's ballding look at. I mean like.

03:52:14
<transcript>: What is that.

03:52:21
zakhal2: Looks like dog poop lol

03:52:23
<transcript>: Okay. Let's do let's see why it stays pretty and also solves it. I want to know if you're right because I.

03:52:23
<transcript>: feel like that's surprised

03:52:24
<transcript>: Feel like that's surprised.

03:52:24
<transcript>: i think that

03:52:29
<transcript>: I think that's actually styling that we want we don't want it to break on.

03:52:31
<transcript>: I don't know.

03:52:31
<transcript>: i know

03:52:33
<transcript>: I know.

03:52:39
<transcript>: Here's. Back to the bad way. We should see it broken again. Team is broken. Okay, now we add.

03:52:44
<transcript>: Remove whitesa's. Pre.

03:52:49
<transcript>: Oh, it did work. But is that styling that we want.

03:52:51
<transcript>: Is that actually.

03:52:51
<transcript>: styling

03:53:01
<transcript>: Styling is. I think it only I think that only fixed it because it didn't line break. Yeah, it's only because prettier did not have to line break. It does look like dog poop. I didn't want to say it, though.

03:53:01
<transcript>: i didn't

03:53:04
<transcript>: I didn't want to say that loud, but that's what it looks like.

03:53:12
thdxr: why do you want whitespace preserve?

03:53:18
thdxr: I think you should remove it

03:53:18
<transcript>: I don't think removing whitespace pre. I don't think that's the move. And I wish I was more confident in my reasons why, but I'm pretty sure it's not the move. Why do you want whitespace? Preserve.

03:53:18
<transcript>: well

03:53:24
<transcript>: Well, I don't necessarily want it, but this is what the styles already looked like.

03:53:24
<transcript>: i'm just

03:53:30
thdxr: IT'S WRONG

03:53:34
<transcript>: I'm just copying the tailwind. I'm trying not to write new tailwind. I'm just taking whatever the site had, and in this case whitespace pre was on these styles, so I left it.

03:53:34
<transcript>: it's just

03:53:37
<transcript>: It's just saying they don't wrap or something. I don't know.

03:53:37
<transcript>: i don't know

03:53:41
neoflexon: man just remove the class

03:53:46
<transcript>: I don't know. It's. That's not why it fixed it. I'm telling you people, it's it's just because the class name became short enough to not wrap on a line.

03:53:48
<transcript>: Just remove the class. Okay, fine.

03:53:50
thdxr: it is why it fixed it!

03:53:52
jenswoeste: delete the newline. <p ....>Team</p>

03:53:55
<transcript>: You guys are awesome, man. Just remove the glass. Okay, fine.

03:53:58
thdxr: whitespace-pre preserves literally what's in your editor

03:53:58
<transcript>: I'll do it, we'll do what you say.

03:53:58
<transcript>: i like you guys

03:54:01
<transcript>: I like you guys. I like you guys a lot.

03:54:05
<transcript>: Team. There you go. Are you happy.

03:54:09
<transcript>: Welcome, chat. Neo flexon. I'm sorry I had to be under these circumstances.

03:54:13
thdxr: so it's not often you'd want that

03:54:19
<transcript>: Let's say that one fine. We'll remove white space free. I just don't know why it was in there, you know? It's like I'm removing apart. It's like, oh, this came with an extra screw. Did it.

03:54:19
<transcript>: did it come with an extra

03:54:20
<transcript>: Did it come with an extra screw.

03:54:22
<transcript>: Or.

03:54:22
<transcript>: or

03:54:24
<transcript>: Or did you.

03:54:24
<transcript>: just not know

03:54:26
<transcript>: Just not know how to put it back together.

03:54:26
<transcript>: a bridge

03:54:28
thdxr: deleting code is good remember

03:54:29
<transcript>: A bridge look at me undoing all my hardware.

03:54:43
<transcript>: You guys are telling me this is the correct way. You're probably right. The leading code is good. That's true. It's not often you'd want. That whyspace pre preserves literally what's in your editor. Oh, that sounds bad. Yeah, that sounds terrible.

03:54:43
<transcript>: i might have

03:54:46
<transcript>: I might have wrote, written that years ago. Who knows.

03:54:50
<transcript>: How.

03:54:53
<transcript>: Now I have to redo all this. That's my fault.

03:55:02
<transcript>: Do we get it all I got it all.

03:55:02
<transcript>: oh i didn't finish

03:55:03
okufa_f: would you ever stream on west coast friendly times? i woke up just 30 minutes ago  lol

03:55:07
<transcript>: Oh, I didn't finish the page, but we made a lot of progress, so we're gonna get rid of all these white space.

03:55:07
<transcript>: because

03:55:09
<transcript>: Because they're wrong.

03:55:09
<transcript>: according to

03:55:11
<transcript>: According to the chat.

03:55:17
<transcript>: That says it wrong. Would you ever stream on West Coast friendly Times? I woke up just 30 minutes ago. Sorry. Ok.

03:55:25
<transcript>: I might it would it would be a life change for me, but I do work for another like 5 hours after this.

03:55:25
<transcript>: yeah

03:55:28
<transcript>: Yeah 5 hours so I could stream later.

03:55:41
<transcript>: You know, honestly, probably a lot of it for me is like a lot of the US streamers are starting around now. Prime tie dax, like people I want to watch. And if I stream during their time, I feel like.

03:55:41
<transcript>: i don't know

maleero: How do you watch and work with only one monitor? LUL

03:56:20
<transcript>: Two. I don't want to compete. Overviewers just feels weird. It's not competing, but it's just like, people have to decide who they're gonna watch. You know? I mean, like, I just don't want people to have so many options at one time that they can't choose at all.
