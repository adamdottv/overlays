cosmiclasagna: @Schrew goodmorning then

00:11:13
<transcript>: Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good afternoon.

00:11:20
<transcript>: Do I need some music for that little like Loading bar. I think there's something lacking. It just goes dead silent.

00:11:23
jenswoeste: hey adam - hands down - such a polished stream setup!

00:11:23
<transcript>: Seems bad. Like it should maybe.

00:11:27
<transcript>: The music should just continue. I don't know.

00:11:38
<transcript>: Such a polished stream set up. Thank you so much, yens. I'm always just like little tweaks here and there every day. In fact, this morning I would have started streaming earlier, but.

00:11:39
bodhihawken: yoooo somehow made it again

00:11:41
<transcript>: I was tweaking.

00:11:41
<transcript>: a new sound

00:11:42
<transcript>: A new sound for the.

00:11:42
<transcript>: dax

00:11:43
earholesmcgee: naw, I dig it. Feels like a nice transition into hanging

00:11:44
schrew: another day another way to change the transitions

00:11:45
<transcript>: Dax sax. Segment.

00:11:47
<transcript>: Because I have a problem.

00:11:53
dmmulroy: buenos dias mis amigos

00:11:57
<transcript>: And that problem is, I really enjoy teasing dax, but I know he teases me, too, so it's fine. I don't know if teases is the right word. Trolling.

00:12:01
<transcript>: Sometimes it gets hateful, but.

00:12:06
<transcript>: Who's here? Good grandpa. Wait, that was yesterday.

00:12:06
<transcript>: sj

00:12:10
cosmiclasagna: trolling is definitely the right word

00:12:11
jenswoeste: remember to DM me if you ever come to Billund Denmark

00:12:12
pbertrand_dev: Hi

00:12:13
<transcript>: Sj was first, but he didn't say first, said yo, yo, yo, and diamond was second, but said first.

00:12:17
jeroenreumkens: Yes, this setup is crazy man! Also crazy you find the time to  tweak it while streaming for so many hours a day, and also having to work 😉

00:12:17
<transcript>: Lol, sheppos here.

00:12:25

adjectiveallison: I love the morning streams - I love the consistency - I love the daily video tweets - I love the energy - But I wish I could watch a little more. From someone without a lot of research I'll share my user experience:  Idk where your schedule is, I'm sure it's integrated into twitch and idk how to use twitch but knowing where that is could be useful.   I know you got kids and family and balance and stuff but I would wonder if 1-2 alternative streams per week could drive more traffic.

00:12:43
<transcript>: Here.

00:12:43
<transcript>: somehow made

00:12:48
adjectiveallison: Maybe you could poll your viewers during a high viewer hour to see if they'd be interested in an afternoon stream? And since you're more chatty than development than the average dev streamer you could focus on non dev to balance your energy/schedule.   This really all just stems from me wanting to watch occasionally but not being available in the morning so take with salt or w/e.

00:12:56
nexxeln: im from south asia too

00:12:59
laame: Good morning!* (* - where applicable)

00:13:03
<transcript>: Somehow made it again. Bodie, keep making it. I like having you here. Ear holes is here. Dig. It feels like a nice transition into hanging. Okay, little silence. Need a little silence before I just talk for 4 hours straight. I never stop talking. I realized that my wife doesn't understand how I can possibly just sit here for 4 hours and never let there be silence.

00:13:06
pbertrand_dev: your tweet offended, triggered and intrigued me. But I'm okay with that

00:13:07
<transcript>: But I don't. I don't stop talking. I just keep going.

00:13:12
<transcript>: Another day. Another way to change the transitions exactly.

00:13:12
<transcript>: does anybody

00:13:15
pbertrand_dev: Kappa

00:13:20
cosmiclasagna: @nexxeln greetings from south east asia brother

00:13:21
<transcript>: Does anybody want? Nobody won, right? Nobody won while I was out I don't need to scroll too hard. I guess you guys would let me know if somebody actually won diamol. Roy is here.

00:13:21
<transcript>: boyna diaz

00:13:25
<transcript>: Boyna, diaz, Mizamigos, and amigas.

00:13:25
<transcript>: got any amig

00:13:25
matty_twoshoes: how would we know if we won

00:13:28
<transcript>: Got any amigas today? It's rare.

00:13:31
nexxeln: good evening @cosmiclasagna

00:13:35
<transcript>: I don't know I don't know if it's me or.

00:13:35
<transcript>: it's just

00:13:37
<transcript>: It's just.

00:13:41
<transcript>: The time of day. Maybe. I don't know.

00:13:54
<transcript>: When do the women developers of twitch show up? Maybe some of you are. And I don't know. I know. There's a few Alison comes. I think lesa is. Maybe. I don't know. Some of these. I'm guessing.

00:13:54
<transcript>: i'm going to

00:14:03
cosmiclasagna: gud evenin'!

00:14:12
<transcript>: I'm going to stop talking now. Trolling is definitely the right word. That's correct. Remember to DM me if you ever come to billand. Am I saying that right? Billion Denmark. I will definitely let you know yens if I ever fly across the ocean to Europe. I've never been to Europe.

00:14:12
<transcript>: if i ever do

00:14:15
<transcript>: If I ever do, I will definitely let you know bertrand is here.

00:14:24
jenswoeste: @adamdotdev - home of LEGO HQ ;)

00:14:26
bodhihawken: wait what!! why not?

00:14:31
<transcript>: Jerome is also here. Yes, this setup is crazy. Also crazy. Find the time to tweak it while streaming for so many hours a day and also having to work well, the key is sometimes just working a lot.

00:14:31
<transcript>: i

00:14:34
<transcript>: I made a little intro this morning.

00:14:36
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:14:56
<transcript>: I'm trying to work on stream. I don't get as much done while we're streaming now, do I? You guys are going to be so surprised for those who were here yesterday. You're going to see where I'm at today on this stuff I'm working on. You're going to be like, wow, you got a lot done between yesterday's end of stream and this morning. And that's accurate because I wasn't streaming and I was getting a lot done.

00:15:03
<transcript>: Diamond will take second. That's no shame in second. I mean, it's just not first. That's all.

00:15:06
<transcript>: The elixir Isens is here. Welcome to chat.

00:15:06
<transcript>: i sense

00:15:09
<transcript>: I sense we're going to be riding some elixir.

00:15:09
<transcript>: and some type

00:15:25
cowfacedev: I need to get my website done. I open the editor and I get blanked :(

00:15:29
<transcript>: And some typescript, but lots of elixir. Next is here. What's going on next? Allison is here. I love the morning streams. I love the consistency. I love the daily video tweets. I love the energy, but I wish I could watch a little more from someone with a lot of research. I'll share my user experience. I don't know where your schedule is. I'm sure it's integrated into twitch, and I don't know how to use.

00:15:29
<transcript>: twitch

00:15:35
<transcript>: Twitch, but knowing where this is could be useful. I do have a schedule on Twitch.

00:15:40
<transcript>: I know you got kids and family imbalance and stuff, but I would wonder if one to two.

00:15:40
<transcript>: altern

00:15:40
jenswoeste: hi @Matty_TwoShoes

00:15:45
<transcript>: Alternative I would use the words alternate and alternative mix.

00:15:45
<transcript>: alternative

00:15:55
cosmiclasagna: @cowFaceDev try and look for inspiration

00:15:56
matty_twoshoes: hey Jens!

00:15:57
schrew: I like the white shirt. Today is a white shirt day

00:16:03
<transcript>: Alternative streams per week could drive more traffic. Interesting. Maybe you could pull your viewers during a higher high viewer hour to see if they'd be interested in an afternoon stream. And since you're more chatty than development, then the average Dev streamer I am more jetty.

00:16:05
tayloreddev: Afternoon, I've been away has anyone won the MacBook yet?

00:16:20
<transcript>: You could focus on non Dev to bound your energy schedule. This really all just stems from me wanting to watch occasionally, but not being available in the morning. So take with salt or whatever. No, that's fantastic advice. Allison. I have dabbled with the afternoon streams. I almost turned on the stream last night.

00:16:20
<transcript>: at night

00:16:32
<transcript>: At night, I was working. My wife was on a walk with her friend and our nanny, and I was like, I could just turn on the stream for an hour. I didn't. And I got a lot done.

00:16:32
<transcript>: so

00:16:35
typosrry: im here boys, we can start now

00:16:35
<transcript>: So I think what I've thought about doing to stream more.

00:16:40
<transcript>: Is not necessarily going full tomato timer but doing.

00:17:00
<transcript>: Like a just like I'm now going to spend an hour and you guys aren't going to hear from me. You can watch you'll hear my nice keyboard as I type and you'll get some cool cinematic shots from all my cameras while I just work away. But I won't be interacting with chat. I do interact a lot. In fact, you could say this is a just chatting stream and you wouldn't.

00:17:00
<transcript>: be far

00:17:01
schrew: omg i would actually get work done

00:17:06
<transcript>: Be far off. I mostly just talk with you all because you're my friends, and I enjoy it.

00:17:12
<transcript>: But I have thought about like I could leave the stream on longer. You guys could just watch me work if you wanted to.

00:17:12
<transcript>: but

00:17:14
pbertrand_dev: That would work but would Dax still be here yelling at you?

00:17:14
<transcript>: But that wouldn't be the same.

00:17:14
<transcript>: so

00:17:20
<transcript>: So I've considered the afternoon thing now that I got partner I don't really care when I stream I was trying to be consistent.

00:17:20
<transcript>: and kind of like

00:17:23
<transcript>: And kind of like build up a good.

00:17:33
<transcript>: Steady group here to get partner. Once I got partner. Now it's like whatever I could stream in the middle of the afternoon. Yeah, maybe I'll just mix it up. Allison, all that to say, I'm going to mix it up.

00:17:34
<transcript>: we're going to mix

00:17:40
<transcript>: We're going to mix it up. So not just the mornings. How about that? Maybe I'll just stream all day, some days.

00:17:48
adjectiveallison: Yes I think setting boundaries with the live stream is almost as important as setting boundaries in relationships. Anyway, I gotta go now but thave a good morning stream :)

00:17:49
<transcript>: Just say like maybe I don't get much done, but I'm going to stream the whole day next is from South Asia, South Asia, not Southeast Asia. That's right.

00:17:58
<transcript>: Lame is here. Good morning. We're applicable. That's what I should say. Merchant your tweet offended, triggered and intrigued me, but I'm okay with that.

00:17:58
<transcript>: okay

00:17:59
<transcript>: Okay.

00:17:59
<transcript>: all those things

00:18:02
fragaverage: oh hello there, what time do you call this?

00:18:03
<transcript>: All those things. That's a lot of feelings. I'll take it.

00:18:09
<transcript>: I don't know why I just took a drink with two hands on the Cup.

00:18:12
<transcript>: Well, it's keeping my hands warm.

00:18:12
<transcript>: but as soon

00:18:16
<transcript>: But as soon as I went up with the two hands, I was like, I'm going to get made fun of.

00:18:16
<transcript>: this looks

00:18:18
<transcript>: This Looks goofy.

00:18:28
<transcript>: How would we know if we won? Maddie, you will get a message. It'll message in chat. It'll be like omg, maddie. Two shoes. Just want a macbook. You won't miss it. I promise.

00:18:32
madeleinepatience: I came in as you did the cup thing 😅

00:18:35
<transcript>: Good evening. Oh, you're talking to somebody else.

00:18:57
cowfacedev: well, I wasn't there for the thdxr drama LUL so anything to make fun of...

00:19:09
<transcript>: Wait. What? Why not? What are we talking about, buddy? I forgot what we were talking about. I need to get my website done. I hope in the iter and I just get blanked. Sorry, calface. Sometimes that happens to me. I was telling DAX I was dming. Dax the other day saying, like, I don't know what's wrong with me. I feel like my brain is not what it used to be.

00:19:09
<transcript>: and not

00:19:12
<transcript>: And not just like normal aging stuff.

00:19:12
<transcript>: it's

00:19:14
<transcript>: It's really hard even when.

00:19:14
<transcript>: i have

00:19:20
<transcript>: I have serious deadline need to get this thing done and lots of incentive to get it done.

00:19:20
<transcript>: it's like

00:19:23
saltyohm: good morning, friend

00:19:25
<transcript>: It's like, I just want to wait till the last minute, and I can't focus. I'm like, just like.

00:19:25
<transcript>: just like

00:19:34
neochromer: maybe you just got ADD ?

00:19:40
<transcript>: Just like piddling checking Twitter, opening up a tab. I ended up on Facebook the other day. I don't even use Facebook, but I was that bored and I'm working like I'm trying to I have like serious stuff I need to get done and like real timelines.

00:19:40
<transcript>: and again

00:19:42
<transcript>: And again real incentives.

00:19:42
<transcript>: and i

00:19:58
<transcript>: And I open Facebook. So something about my attention span has degraded. I felt like I used to be able to stay here for 12 hours. If I had to in my twenty s, I could sit down and just not look away for 12 hours. I know that's bad for you. I get it.

00:20:01
<transcript>: But I just felt like I could lock onto a thing.

00:20:01
<transcript>: and just not

00:20:06
<transcript>: And just not do anything else until it was done and I couldn't get enough time on some problems.

00:20:06
<transcript>: these days

00:20:10
kiwifromearth: hi im kiwi

00:20:10
neochromer: attention spans are degrading fast

00:20:11
<transcript>: These days. I can't do that. And I don't know if it's aging or if it's social media or both.

00:20:18
<transcript>: Or twitch. I don't know. I'm not too mad about it. It's just kind of something. I've noticed.

00:20:25
<transcript>: You like the white shirt? Today is White Shirt Day. That's right. We have white and black shirts, just like Prime.

00:20:25
<transcript>: i don't

00:20:25
neochromer: I've also talked with the wife, she used to read books like a crazy person

00:20:27
saltyohm: I've never had that sort of attention span, even when I was younger.  I'm jealous of people that can focus like that

00:20:28
neochromer: in the last few yers

00:20:28
<transcript>: I don't change what I'm working on based on my shirt.

00:20:28
<transcript>: but

00:20:31
<transcript>: But I do have white and black shirts.

00:20:36
neochromer: she can't sit down and read a book like a normal person

00:20:36
<transcript>: Afternoon. Taylor's here. I've been away.

00:20:50
<transcript>: if

<transcript>: If I just let you guys watch me some ASMR work streaming.

She used to read books like a crazy person. In the last few years. She can't sit down and read a book like an old version. Okay. I do think there's something there. I know. Everyone says that. I don't know if there's been studies. I know people.

madeleinepatience: Agree with Ali, find a book you love and you’ll fall in love with reading.

00:23:40
<transcript>: Ho, because I found a genre. I can't put it. Oh, Ally, what is it? What is the genre? I love biographies. I could listen to a Walter isaac's biography, like every single day of my life. But he's only written so many. And I've listened to them all. I love biographies. I always learn so much. Just listening to somebody's life. I don't know. That's about the only thing I can endure.

00:23:53

pbertrand_dev: I miss dax

00:24:51
<transcript>: Luigi's here. I missed axe, too. Is he never coming back.

00:24:59
endingwithali: Also I have been diagnosed with adhd for 20+ years so I am the queen of it

00:24:59
<transcript>: Is he just like after yesterday. Was that the nail in the coffin? We'll do a few Daxacks while he's gone. That's more fun.

nexxeln: When people prefer video games to reading, the co-worker says, they’re often said to have a short attention span, even if they’re concentrating on video games for hours at a time.

00:25:26
<transcript>: Ocpd, which is like ocd, but not ocd. It's the personality disorder kind where you can actually change it. It's not like hardwired, I guess. I don't know.

00:25:29
nexxeln: But Culkin’s character raises an evocative and perhaps alarming point, challenging the tendency of readers and other connoisseurs of art to believe that their interests render them better people and are superior to other people’s pursuits. Is art another evasion for the introvert? The co-worker asks Casey, “Are we losing interest in everyday life?”

00:25:31
<transcript>: Just very obsessive and weird about some things.

00:25:37
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't know. It could be those letters? Could be other letters? I think I had some letters.

00:25:37
<transcript>: there's something

00:25:42
<transcript>: There's something that's not typical neurotypical, if you will.

00:25:42
<transcript>: probably

00:25:42
endingwithali: Oof ocd is hard

00:25:44

00:26:04
<transcript>: When people prefer video games to reading, the coworker says they're often said to have a short attention span, even if they're constraining on video games for hours of time. Oh, that's a good point. Culkin's character raises an evocative and perhaps alarming point, challenging the tendency of readers and other connoisseurs of art to believe that their interests render them better people and are superior to other people's pursuits.

00:26:04
<transcript>: in art

00:26:12
<transcript>: In art. Another evasion for the introvert. Oh, is Art another evasion for the introvert? The coworker asks, Casey, Are we losing interest in every life? Where is that from next.

00:26:21
<transcript>: Interesting perspective from conversation in the movie I recently watched. Okay.

00:26:25

00:26:25

00:26:36
nexxeln: its a beautiful movie

00:26:43

00:26:48
vamoacodear: jajaja

00:26:50
<transcript>: Columbus. Happy Wednesday, Neil. So typescript. Looks just like C. Sharp. You're going to feel right at home.

00:26:58

00:30:53

daglee: No, danish is denmark

00:31:03
smilingbig: no danish is different

00:31:05

<transcript>: Denmark, danes, Netherlands, Dutch now I'm so mixed up.

00:31:35
<transcript>: Arodi. Welcome to Chat. What country are you from.

00:31:44
smilingbig: I think holland is also just part of the netherlands if I remember correctly

00:31:46
<transcript>: Madeline Love stroke. Awfuls. Strobe. Waffles. Not here today, but we have somebody named after the breakfast. Breakfast? Is it a breakfast thing? I'm assuming, because it's waffles.

00:31:50
<transcript>: It's all Europe. In the end.

00:31:50
<transcript>: holl

00:31:55
<transcript>: Holland is also just part of the Netherlands. Okay, I'm so confused.

00:31:57
midnightcomm: Is statmuse going to a subscription model? How are you building that in Astro since it’s a static site generator? Sorry if I missed the explanation before.

00:32:00
<transcript>: I'm going to move on. So. Okay, our connections to database is working.

00:32:00
typosrry: @smilingbig isn't Holland is the same as The Netherlands?

00:32:01
madeleinepatience: Coffee treat category I’d say

00:32:03
isense__: !today

00:32:03
fossabot: Today Adam is working on statmuse.com, a website for sports nerds.

00:32:04
<transcript>: What's not working is.

00:32:04
airotii: Iraq NotLikeThis

00:32:07
<transcript>: This query.

00:32:07
<transcript>: so

00:32:10
<transcript>: So client reference idea apparently.

00:32:11
jenswoeste: this is turning into one of those YT were random american students are asked about geography (eg "denmark is the capital of IKEA")

00:32:16
<transcript>: This client session client reference ID. Apparently.

00:32:23
<transcript>: That is not any of the user's ids where Users ID equals Client reference ID.

00:32:23
<transcript>: take first

00:32:23
smilingbig: I might be wrong typosrry I thought holland was like a province or something

00:32:24
<transcript>: Take first.

00:32:30
<transcript>: I don't know why that's not working. Select email. Do I have to also select ID or something.

00:32:35
<transcript>: Maybe. I don't know. Let's try it again just in case I mess something up.

00:32:38
<transcript>: Resend.

00:32:42
jenswoeste: Holland == The Netherlands

00:32:43
<transcript>: Undefined bummer.

00:32:48
<transcript>: And coffee treat category. I'd say, okay, so, Madeline.

00:32:48
<transcript>: stroke

00:32:54
<transcript>: Stroke apples are actually just a coffee treat. They're not a breakfast treat. It's like a coffee cake. In America.

00:32:58
smilingbig: cool my bad

00:33:05
warrenbuffering: long time listener, first time caller. How's react conf going so far? Having fun?

00:33:06
<transcript>: Midnight. Is sammy's going to a subscription model? How are you building that in astro? Since it's a static site generator. Sorry if I missed explanation before you did not miss the explanation. No one has asked that question. Great question.

00:33:10
<transcript>: Astro has ssr as well.

00:33:12
<transcript>: And.

00:33:12
<transcript>: we're basically like right

00:33:15
madeleinepatience: I’m Canadian though so please don’t quote me on that. You can ask me about poutine though

00:33:22
<transcript>: We're basically like right now the astro reride is not done. A lot of the ui has been ported over, but there's a lot of other stuff that just hasn't been.

00:33:24
<transcript>: So.

00:33:24
<transcript>: things like

00:33:26
<transcript>: Things like analytics.

00:33:27
fragaverage: @JensWoeste Holland is a province in The Netherlands no?

00:33:32
<transcript>: And there's just a whole bunch of other back end code that needs to be ported over.

00:33:37
<transcript>: And Mothra the elixir app is going to remain running for some time.

00:33:37
<transcript>: there's no

00:33:41
daglee: So Holland is a county in Netherlands, like Florida in US. Dutch is what the English call people from Netherlands because they thought they were Germans (called deutsch in german).

00:33:46
nexxeln: have you tried shawarma poutine from shelbys @madeleinepatience

00:33:51
nexxeln: it looks so good on youtube

00:33:56
<transcript>: There's no date for when will eventually phase out everything that it does because it does a lot of like we have a custom cms called Metal and Metal is where our creatives can add new illustrations for players and say what team and what years that illustration applies to. There's like a bunch of stuff they can do. They create a bunch of.

00:33:56
<transcript>: sports content

00:33:57
smilingbig: ah great so I wasn't wrong? KEKW

00:34:06
typosrry: this netherlands just gets more confusing

00:34:08
<transcript>: Sports content and stuff like that in Metal. So the elixir app that will live on for a long time we're just replacing the consumer facing web part and in astro, we can do all the things we would do.

00:34:08
<transcript>: in elixir

00:34:13
smilingbig: KEKW

00:34:17
<transcript>: In elixir just using serverside rendering so it's not just static up front at build time. You can actually do real time ssr stuff too.

00:34:20
<transcript>: Okay.

00:34:20
<transcript>: today

00:34:20
typosrry: I think nobody really knows

00:34:29
<transcript>: Today. There's a command I never touch today. Adam, is what sammy's Dot website for. Hey, it's right. That's correct. We are working on that.

00:34:47
<transcript>: I keep trying to come up with a new way to pronounce your name. Arrow. We're going to go with arrow. Arrow. D. Arrow. You're from Iraq. Anybody else from Iraq? Anybody? This is training in one of those YouTube where Ran American students are asked about geography.

<transcript>: What? What is that word? Pouting? Pouting? Is that a country.

00:35:57
smilingbig: you don't know poutine? KEKW

00:36:03
<transcript>: Holland is a province in the Netherlands. We're still talking about the Netherlands. Holland as a county in the Netherlands. Like Florida in the US. Well, Florida is a state. Dutch is what the English call people from the Netherlands because they thought they were germans, called, oh, my goodness, so confusing.

00:36:03
<transcript>: have you tried

00:36:03
nexxeln: poutine is french fries chaos

00:36:24
<transcript>: Reading the embolds here. My favorite is arcan. My favorite Miami. Hey, Dmbo, could you go over there and slap dax around and tell him to get on my stream? It's so quiet around here without him, it's not quiet.

00:36:24

<transcript>: It's lacking something.

00:36:28
<transcript>: Next.

00:36:28

00:36:36
dnbull: LOL nah I hate going to south beach :D

00:36:38
lesabotsy: Chat seams a little calm without some trolls :p

dnbull: i went to react miami last year but not this year

00:36:47
unacervezaporfavorrr: Hola

00:36:54
<transcript>: What's the deciding factor between when to go next? Js versus astro? If ssg is available on both, okay, so if you're building something highly interactive, you should use nextjs or something else.

00:36:54
<transcript>: that's high

00:37:14
<transcript>: That's highly interactive. So Astro you can do the Islands of interactivity. But if you're building like a single page application nextjs, if you're building more of a lots of pages less interactivity like stat. Muse multi page is great and Astro is a ton of fun. I love Astro. It's like PHP but typescript.

00:37:14
<transcript>: it's fun

00:37:25
<transcript>: It's fun and their docs are great. The cli is great. There's just kind of like a really great vibe. This is very friendly framework, whereas if you've come from the next js world, it's a little pretentious.

00:37:34
<transcript>: A little, like, heavy, little serious. All the branding and all everything is just very serious. This is very serious stuff we're doing.

00:37:34
<transcript>: astro

00:37:37
warrenbuffering: Thanks man, good to be here! Hard for me to catch ya live, but I like whatchur up to. #ClassComponentGang

00:37:42
<transcript>: Astro is so light hearted and fun and I know that's just like a minor thing, but it's really well suited for sat music's use case so I'm loving it quite a lot.

00:37:47
<transcript>: You don't know? Poutine kick. I don't. It's. French fries. Chaos. What.

00:37:47
<transcript>: it's

00:37:50
<transcript>: It's a country oh, boy.

00:38:12

pbertrand_dev: Yeah we also saw you spent 4k on something in aws but we cant see what

00:59:16
<transcript>: Leaking a lot of stuff. Ssc does look cool, but it feels a bit complicated at some points. Is it because I'm an aws? Noob. Or I'm not bald enough. Silver.

00:59:27
treasonist: ever write a 900 line yaml file for your infra?

00:59:28
<transcript>: It's not complicated. I'm doing a lot of different things. The ssd parts are very straightforward. I'm just doing lots of other things that you're watching and thinking it might. I'm assuming you're thinking some of the things I'm doing are ssd when they are not.

00:59:35

warrenbuffering: @pbertrand_dev password: reactservercompOnents12

01:00:35
<transcript>: What's wrong here? Our line number is not accurate. Packages core at null. I think this is all like transpiled or something. The error message is off. Okay, so I just haven't set a secret value. Maybe. Let's just go through and make sure I've set all the secret values. Let's do this.

01:00:37
thdxr: does it have db credentials?

01:00:39
<transcript>: Let's do this.

01:00:40
pbertrand_dev: LUL

<transcript>: or does it

01:01:14
<transcript>: Or does it just use the profile of my shell.

01:01:26
<transcript>: I think it should use the profile for my shell. Right. So that's stripe secret.

01:01:26
<transcript>: now let's do

01:01:29
<transcript>: Now let's do stripe webhook secret.

01:01:31

<transcript>: Shirados thank you for that prime sub. Gave me your one and only prime sub.

01:02:06
<transcript>: i will guard it

01:02:16
<transcript>: I will guard it with care. I'll take real good care of it. Pmpm. Ssc. Secrets. Okay. We got price ID. We got secrets. We need.

01:02:16
<transcript>: api

01:02:23
<transcript>: Api key. Sure. And then we need the stripe webhook secret.

01:02:26
<transcript>: Kmpm, sse. Secrets.

01:02:30
<transcript>: Webhook. Secret. There it is.

01:02:37
<transcript>: Okay. So I've set all the secrets now I'm just setting as fallback. I'm assuming that's okay.

01:02:40
<transcript>: If that's okay, then.

01:02:44
<transcript>: We should be good.

01:02:48
<transcript>: Right.

01:02:52
<transcript>: Okay. That would leak all my secrets. Don't want to do that.

01:02:57
<transcript>: I'm going to have to clear.

01:03:00
<transcript>: Let's try it again.

01:03:00
<transcript>: okay now i can

01:03:02
<transcript>: Okay. Now I can take off fuzzy.

01:03:13
<transcript>: I've gotten pretty good at not leaking my secrets. I say that and I'm definitely going to leak a secret, aren't I? And just ask for it. Okay. Let's see what happens now.

01:03:18
<transcript>: So I think I've set the values now. So.

01:03:18
<transcript>: adam

01:03:21
<transcript>: Adam plus test. I don't know. Four.

01:03:23
itsmeleague: Should teach primeagen, he constantly leaks

01:03:24
warrenbuffering: secrets don't make friends

01:03:26
<transcript>: Let's do five. I don't know what I've done. I can check right here.

01:03:28
<transcript>: Customers.

01:03:36
<transcript>: Test one and two. Why did it do twice for that one? Oh, well, let's do test.

01:03:36
<transcript>: testify

01:03:40
<transcript>: Testify is fine upgrade to samus pro.

01:03:40
<transcript>: secret

01:03:42
<transcript>: Secrets. Don't make friends. That's right.

01:03:46
<transcript>: Should teach prime. He constantly leaks.

01:03:47
<transcript>: Why.

01:03:52
<transcript>: It can't get the secret. But what secret.

01:03:52
<transcript>: you're pretty sure the

01:03:53
magicwildturtle: hey dude, just dropped in but maybe the resource accessing the secret doesn't have perms to access the secret?

01:03:57
<transcript>: You're pretty sure the error message is off you said magic while.

01:03:57
<transcript>: turtle

01:04:05
<transcript>: Turtle, turtle, welcome to Chat. Just dropped in, but maybe the resource access in the secret doesn't have permits. Access. Secret? I mean, that's clearly what it's saying.

01:04:09
<transcript>: I just don't understand. Let's see. I got to think about this.

01:04:09
<transcript>: error

01:04:16
<transcript>: Error user assumed role. Okay. It's the checkout authorizer. So it's the authorizer specifically doesn't have access.

01:04:16
<transcript>: to okay

01:04:25
<transcript>: To okay, let's just make sure that I give the authorizer all of the secrets api key stripe, secret web hook, secret price ID. They're all bound.

01:04:31
<transcript>: I guess I could also give the credentials. Oh, the credentials.

01:04:35
<transcript>: The credentials. Is it Loading the DB.

01:04:35
<transcript>: let's see

01:04:39
<transcript>: Let's see the authorizer is in here.

01:04:43
<transcript>: So this authorizer is what importing stripe.

01:04:43
<transcript>: but importing

01:04:54
<transcript>: But importing stripe shouldn't also. Oh, that imports db. So when it does this, it imports db, and then the credentials. Yes, that's what happened. Okay, cool. I know what to do.

01:04:54
<transcript>: i know what

01:05:01
<transcript>: I know what to do. I didn't think I had to do this and this is really annoying, but authorizer check out.

01:05:01
<transcript>: auth

01:05:07
<transcript>: Authorizer oh, no, I don't know if I can get the chart. Can I get the function.

01:05:12
<transcript>: I don't know if I can get it. Hey, dax, are you still here.

01:05:17
<transcript>: Can I get an eight? An authorizer function. Probably not.

01:05:27
<transcript>: Because I can only pass a route key I need the authorizer.

01:05:33
<transcript>: Does checkout function checkout function authorizer.

01:05:33
<transcript>: no

01:05:35
<transcript>: No, it doesn't.

01:05:39
<transcript>: Bummer.

01:05:39
<transcript>: okay

01:05:40
<transcript>: Okay.

01:05:40
<transcript>: this is so annoying

01:05:45
<transcript>: This is so annoying interacting with legacy secrets that are not first party.

01:05:54
<transcript>: Well, how am I giving? How am I giving it permissions.

01:05:58
magicwildturtle: yea the grantRead thing you are missing, I think :D

01:06:04
<transcript>: I'm giving the actual function permissions, but not the authorizer. I guess I could fix the import issue because right now it's just importing too much and that could just be fixed.

01:06:11
<transcript>: Let's see. So stripe Imports db right here. But maybe we shouldn't do that.

01:06:14
smilingbig: magicwildturtle o/

01:06:16
<transcript>: Or Maybe NDB.

01:06:19
thdxr: you can pull the authorizer out and grant

01:06:24
<transcript>: We shouldn't get the secret here. Maybe we should just highlight getting it top level, but we could not get it top level. We could.

01:06:24
<transcript>: say

01:06:26
<transcript>: Say.

01:06:36
<transcript>: Like, all this stuff comes down here and it just goes into no, we'd have to have a function for creating a new DB.

01:06:36
<transcript>: you can pull

01:06:41
<transcript>: You can pull the authorizer out and grant. Oh, I can. How can I do that, dax? Because that would make this all go away.

01:06:46
<transcript>: Probably very nasty. I don't like it. I got to find a better solution.

01:06:46
<transcript>: grant

01:06:54
<transcript>: Grant Reed thing. You were missing? Yeah, definitely. We're definitely missing. I just don't know how to get the function. How do I pull it out? If it's an authorizer.

01:06:55
thdxr: declare the authorizer function separately

01:06:57
<transcript>: Get authorizer.

01:07:00
<transcript>: Clear the authorizer function temporarily.

01:07:04
<transcript>: Check out authorizer.

01:07:06
magicwildturtle: @smilingbig o/

01:07:08
<transcript>: Equals. Okay. So.

01:07:10
<transcript>: This.

01:07:14
<transcript>: Like this.

01:07:18
<transcript>: Saying I can do this.

01:07:18
<transcript>: function

01:07:20
<transcript>: Function? Oh, I declare the function.

01:07:27
<transcript>: The function, not the whole thing. That was a very tedious thing. I just did. Did you hear that.

01:07:32
<transcript>: Very Ted. The function.

01:07:40
<transcript>: Okay. So that's the function. Now I can just do this.

01:07:46
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:07:47
smilingbig: KEKW

01:07:48
<transcript>: Maybe.

01:07:51
<transcript>: Why didn't it.

01:07:59
<transcript>: And then here check out authorizer. Yes.

01:08:05
<transcript>: Now, presumably, I can say check out authorizer. No, I'm sorry.

01:08:10
<transcript>: I can say rds credentialsecret, grant read.

01:08:16
<transcript>: Authorizer no. Check out.

01:08:25
<transcript>: Authorizer function or check out authorizer. Is that Grantable? What is that? It's a function that's like a cdk function. Okay, cool. It works. It's grantable.

01:08:25
<transcript>: now

01:08:27
<transcript>: Now it should be good.

01:08:27
<transcript>: it's going to

01:08:31
<transcript>: It's going to deploy that we should be good.

01:08:34
<transcript>: Updating the im policy.

01:08:34
<transcript>: cool

01:08:38
<transcript>: Cool. Thank you, dax, for all of the trolling.

magicwildturtle: maybe you need to do .grantRead() for each secret?

01:10:06
<transcript>: Unhandled webhook event check out session expired. That's fine.

01:10:09
<transcript>: It never even tried to call this time.

01:10:11
<transcript>: Never even tried to call.

01:10:14
<transcript>: Did it.

01:10:19
<transcript>: Internal server error. Oh, I think you know what it is.

01:10:22
<transcript>: I think it's cached.

01:10:22
<transcript>: because i have a one minute

01:10:27
<transcript>: Because I have a 1 minute cache on the authorizer. Could that be it.

01:10:29
<transcript>: Could it be.

01:10:33
<transcript>: Can you see the air again? Yes. Right here.

01:10:36
<transcript>: Nah get secret value no idea base policy.

01:10:36
<transcript>: allows secrets

01:10:37
aj_stuyvenberg: you can check and see if the authorizer function was invoked

01:10:41
<transcript>: Allows secrets manager get shooting action. I'm going to look at the function. Let's just do this.

01:10:46
<transcript>: Yeah. Check and see if the authorizer function was invoked. Yeah. We could go to the ssd console.

01:10:49
aj_stuyvenberg: oh your function needs permissionsss

01:10:56
<transcript>: Function needs permission. Stripe. Web hooks. Okay, that's webhooks.

01:10:56
<transcript>: let's

01:11:02
<transcript>: Let's go to checkout. Oh, checkout authorizer. I'm just going to look at it in the console.

01:11:02
<transcript>: let's see

01:11:03
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:11:08
<transcript>: The actual console. Let's go to Lambda.

01:11:12
thdxr: ok just making sure it’s not an sst issue so now i can deny all liability

01:11:13
<transcript>: Find the checkout authorizer.

01:11:14
thdxr: :)

01:11:24
<transcript>: Here it is. Let's see. Does it have permissions? I'll be the judge of that.

01:11:32
<transcript>: Here's, the roll.

01:11:38
aj_stuyvenberg: nope

01:11:41

<transcript>: Making sure it's not an ssd issue. So now I can deny all liability.

01:11:52
mo_ali141: Its okay

01:11:56
<transcript>: Maybe you need to do grant read for each secret.

01:11:59
mo_ali141: :)

01:12:01
mo_ali141: Hey look AWS

01:12:01
<transcript>: Yet. We just need to do grant read for the legacy secret. The sst ones. They work.

01:13:02
<transcript>: really i don't

mo_ali141: Lol, I'm in CDK land now.

01:13:32
<transcript>: That's just not very kind to Alan like that. Hey, dax, why is it doing this? Why is it appending these question marks? I feel like I've seen this before. Aws.

01:13:32
<transcript>: aaron

01:13:33
<transcript>: Aaron.

01:13:36

01:13:52
<transcript>: Oh, a lot is a bald dose, open source dev. Oh, my goodness.

01:14:06
<transcript>: Neilbone question for chat. Does anyone know how to get ts server to properly format the markdown in that and that I do not dmlroy.

01:14:06
<transcript>: why

01:14:11
<transcript>: Why am I getting question marks? Let's do this. It'd be a cdk. Get up.

01:14:11
thdxr: ohh did you import the secret

01:14:15
<transcript>: That thing I would normally just type in here.

01:14:17
thdxr: remember how imports are fake lol

01:14:17
<transcript>: Six of them.

01:14:20
<transcript>: Six.

01:14:24
aj_stuyvenberg: each question mark is a wildcard

01:14:24
thdxr: and you have to provide all the values

01:14:27
mo_ali141: ???? is just any character with that limit I thought.

01:14:27
<transcript>: Where was that? It's up here.

01:14:27
<transcript>: why

01:14:29
thdxr: see if you can do a lookup

01:14:30
<transcript>: Why is it doing? Why is it doing that.

01:14:34
<transcript>: Six of them. Yeah.

01:14:38
<transcript>: I feel like I should know why this is doing this.

01:14:38
<transcript>: so you can

01:14:40
aj_stuyvenberg: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_resource.html

01:14:43
<transcript>: So you can do a lookup. Yeah, that's what I'm doing. So, dax, here's where I'm getting. I'll show you where I'm getting the secret.

01:14:50
mo_ali141: Look at the arn secret.

01:14:56
<transcript>: Rds credential secret right here. I'm looking it up. If the stage is production, it's that name. Otherwise. So I'm doing from secret name. Do I need to do oh, maybe I need to do something else. Maybe I need to do.

01:14:57
mo_ali141: You might have some uid at the end.

01:15:03
<transcript>: From secret attributes Complete ARN.

01:15:06
<transcript>: Do the complete ARN.

01:15:13
gitpush_gitpaid: top of the morning fellas

01:15:13
<transcript>: Oh, is that a wild card? Is that just a wild card you have to provide.

01:15:13
<transcript>: all each

01:15:16
thdxr: is it failing to find it?

01:15:17
<transcript>: All. Each question Mark is a wild card. Okay, so wild cards are fine, right.

01:15:23
thdxr: is there a .lookup function

01:15:23
<transcript>: So why is it not working? It has good secret, right.

01:15:26
<transcript>: What's the problem.

01:15:26
mo_ali141: Yeah on the arn.

01:15:27
thdxr: forgot how this works

01:15:28
<transcript>: Get secret value.

01:15:30
<transcript>: On.

01:15:31
mo_ali141: What's the error?

01:15:32
<transcript>: This secret Mothra.

01:15:32
<transcript>: stage

01:15:34
<transcript>: Stage db Astro.

01:15:39
<transcript>: Oh, jeez, that's showing the secret value.

01:15:43
<transcript>: I'm going to leak stuff.

01:15:45
<transcript>: Okay.

01:15:48
<transcript>: Secrets manager.

01:15:51
aj_stuyvenberg: yeah two things to check: 1. is that the right secret ARN? 2. Are there other secrets your authorizer function needs to complete the request?

01:15:54
<transcript>: Well, this has been an annoying start. Stuff I thought was done from yesterday.

01:15:56
<transcript>: There it is.

01:16:01
<transcript>: Seven, two, three, yeah, mothra Stage db, astro. And then.

01:16:01
<transcript>: six charact

01:16:02
<transcript>: Six characters.

01:16:09
<transcript>: One. Is that the right secret? Arn? Yes. Two. Are there other secrets you're authoring for you to complete progress.

01:16:12
<transcript>: Well, you know what.

01:16:16
<transcript>: It's not feeling to find it it's finding it.

01:16:16
<transcript>: top of

01:16:20
<transcript>: Top of the morning. Turk is here. What's going on? Turk.

01:16:20
<transcript>: so

01:16:22
<transcript>: So here we go.

01:16:26
<transcript>: It does not have permissions to any other secrets.

01:16:26
<transcript>: as get parame

01:16:40
mo_ali141: Is your secret encrypted with KMS?

01:16:40
<transcript>: As get parameters. Dax does it just use parameters. It doesn't use Secrets manager for all the built in ssc secrets. Yeah, like stripe press ID. Here we go. Stripe poke secret. These are all just get parameters. And those seem to be fine.

01:16:51
nishaaaanth: Cheer7

01:16:53
<transcript>: Is your secret encrypted with kms. You have the built in secret or the built in Kmski, though, right? Yeah. Aws, secrets measure. Oh, is it lacking.

01:16:54
thdxr: no calls to secrets manager from sst

01:16:57
mo_ali141: If so, you'll need KMS access.

01:16:59
<transcript>: Nisha. Welcome to Chat and thanks for the bits. Thank you so much.

01:16:59
<transcript>: no calls

01:17:01
2dorkstv: morning, nerds!

01:17:05
<transcript>: No calls to Secrets manager from SEC. Cool. You need kms exit. Good call. Mo ally.

01:17:05
<transcript>: good

01:17:11
<transcript>: Good call. Why didn't grant it? Why didn't it grant the kms needed.

01:17:15
<transcript>: When I did grant from the cdk.

01:17:15
<transcript>: let's see

01:17:18
<transcript>: Let's see cdk secret.

01:17:20
<transcript>: Grant read.

01:17:20
<transcript>: kms

01:17:22
<transcript>: Kms.

01:17:29
<transcript>: Cyclic reference. That's not my problem.

01:17:32
mo_ali141: It doesn't add the kms permissions.

01:17:33
<transcript>: But I am feeling like.

01:17:39
mo_ali141: Only the Secrets manager read.

01:17:40
<transcript>: It's not adding all of the permissions. It doesn't add the kms permissions. Bummer.

01:17:46
<transcript>: Okay, bummer. So why was this working before it was working.

01:17:51
<transcript>: Why was this working.

01:17:51
nishaaaanth: What's going on what's cooking?

01:18:03
<transcript>: No. Why is it working? Why is it working in the webhook function, but not the authorizer? Oh, does the webic effect? Let's look at the Web hook function. Maybe it has.

01:18:03
<transcript>: access

01:18:06
<transcript>: Access. Let's see here.

01:18:06
<transcript>: check

01:18:08
<transcript>: Check out authorizer. Let's see.

01:18:13
<transcript>: Post stripe webhooks right here.

01:18:15
mo_ali141: Do you have a role on the webhook function?

01:18:16
<transcript>: Let's look at its configuration.

01:18:16
<transcript>: per

01:18:19
<transcript>: Permissions role.

01:18:22
<transcript>: Do you have a role in the webhook function? Yeah. We're going to look at it right now.

01:18:29
<transcript>: Here we go get parameters, get parameters, get parameters, get secret value. It's got the same basic.

01:18:39
mo_ali141: Look at the other policies.

01:18:39
<transcript>: Permissions and it can hit the database. We saw it do a select count query.

01:18:49
<transcript>: Basic execution role. It does have other roles.

01:18:53
<transcript>: But nothing with kms.

01:18:53
<transcript>: look at the other policies

01:18:54
<transcript>: Look at the other policies. Yeah.

01:18:58
<transcript>: Weird.

01:19:03
<transcript>: What's going on.

01:19:07
<transcript>: Okay think.

01:19:07
<transcript>: use that

01:19:08
mo_ali141: Is it accessing the same secret?

01:19:10
<transcript>: Use that brain. Think Adam.

01:19:11
statsndata: You left an untouched larabar on the table?

01:19:14
<transcript>: Is it accessing the same secret? Yeah.

01:19:14
<transcript>: it's just

01:19:21
<transcript>: It's just imported from the same place right here. We do it's like a top level await. I just get the secret right here.

01:19:29
<transcript>: I get the secret value whenever you import this DB file.

01:19:29
<transcript>: and

01:19:30
<transcript>: And.

01:19:30
<transcript>: the authorizer

01:19:31
<transcript>: The authorizer.

01:19:38
<transcript>: Now is inadvertently importing all that because we import stripe.

01:19:47
<transcript>: But you know what? It doesn't need stripe. So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to move it to a separate file. I should have done this from the beginning.

01:19:54
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't know why the authorizer doesn't work, but I think I can solve this by just doing.

01:19:59
<transcript>: Checkout authorizer.

01:20:05
mo_ali141: That won't solve your problem though if it needs to access the same secret.

01:20:11
<transcript>: It doesn't need stripe. So why import it? Why even import it? So now the authorizer stands alone. I can delete it from here.

01:20:16
<transcript>: Just like that.

01:20:16
<transcript>: and now

01:20:20
<transcript>: And now we need to just change the Stack api stack.

01:20:23
<transcript>: Let's see down here.

01:20:23
<transcript>: auth

01:20:28
<transcript>: Authorizer is checkout. Oh, it's right here.

01:20:30
<transcript>: Stripe.

01:20:35
<transcript>: Check out authorizer.

01:20:39
<transcript>: No dot handler.

01:20:42
mo_ali141: Lol, I saw ACCESS_KEY_ID being used somewhere there.

01:20:43
<transcript>: And then I need to go back.

01:20:43
<transcript>: and

01:20:44
<transcript>: And.

01:20:46
<transcript>: Change that.

01:20:46
<transcript>: handler

01:20:48
<transcript>: Handler. Okay.

01:20:55
<transcript>: You saw access key ID being used somewhere. There. What no api is api key.

01:20:55
<transcript>: api

01:20:57
<transcript>: Api key.

01:20:58
<transcript>: keyboard

01:20:58
<transcript>: keyboard where is it

01:21:11
<transcript>: Keyboard? Where is it? Api key? That's different. It's a custom. It's like a custom API key built with no changes. That's a little suss. That's a little suss. There are definitely some changes. Okay.

01:21:15
<transcript>: Lots of changes you might even say.

01:21:21
<transcript>: Did I see your follow Nisha? Thank you for the follow Nisha.

01:21:26
<transcript>: That won't solve your problem though if it needs to access the same secret.

01:21:35
<transcript>: I left an untouched Lar bar. Yes, we have not eaten the larvae yet. I'm actually pretty hungry, though, so I might eat it real soon.

01:21:35
<transcript>: okay

01:21:37
<transcript>: Okay.

01:21:37
<transcript>: let's

01:21:40
<transcript>: Let's see. So now let's try and hit it.

01:21:43
<transcript>: Let's do this.

01:21:47
<transcript>: Can't believe.

01:21:47
<transcript>: i

01:21:49
<transcript>: I'm still doing this stuff.

01:21:56
<transcript>: This is just what I got working yesterday. Then I started adding database connectivity. And I broke everything.

01:22:02
<transcript>: Oh, it's working. Okay. So that works. Now. Now we're going to see if the webhook works.

01:22:02
<transcript>: if

01:22:05
<transcript>: If the webhook function is able to import the database.

01:22:11
<transcript>: I also did some cool stuff where.

01:22:12
smilingbig: Clap first try

01:22:32
<transcript>: The callback. I generate the callback url based on the login so they don't have to get the email and then log in. It just logs them in automatically. If they successfully subscribe it's going to just redirect to the login url, which has the token. The login token we have like a magic link system. So I thought that was a good way to do it.

01:22:32
<transcript>: they're logged in when they

01:22:35
<transcript>: They're logged in when they get back, right? Boom, logged in now.

01:22:40
warrenbuffering: wait, so what was going wrong?

01:22:43
<transcript>: So the way I can I don't have any indication visually that you're logged in. The way I can show you though is most points.

01:22:43
<transcript>: in a game

01:22:44
<transcript>: In a game.

01:22:44
<transcript>: should show

01:22:54
<transcript>: Should show all the rows now because I'm a logged in. Oh, it won't because I'm not a paid. We still got to do that in the webhook. It's still not considered a paid user. But if I go to here.

01:22:54
<transcript>: if i

01:23:00
<transcript>: If I go to Pro, should pre populate my email. Yeah, it means I'm logged in. Okay, cool.

01:23:00
<transcript>: first try

01:23:01
<transcript>: First try.

01:23:01
<transcript>: so

01:23:05
<transcript>: So what was going wrong? Worrying buffering? I still don't know.

01:23:05
<transcript>: i don't know

01:23:08
<transcript>: I don't know what was going wrong.

01:23:08
<transcript>: let me

01:23:10
<transcript>: Let me show you this, though.

01:23:12
gitpush_gitpaid: wait if you were logged in whyd it say "go pro"

01:23:13
<transcript>: What I do know.

01:23:13
smilingbig: <3

01:23:17
warrenbuffering: something async?

01:23:29
<transcript>: Is I was importing the authorizer function was importing all of that code that needed to actually fetch secrets and stuff, and it didn't need to. I'm just using the config. The built in sst config here.

01:23:29
<transcript>: like

01:23:49
<transcript>: Like this stuff that's all built into sst. It says you can use Secrets manager. That's what I'm using in the authorizer function, and I just had it in the same file to just not split it out and just make it easier. But that was causing me to import all this extra stuff I didn't need, and it was trying to access secrets that didn't have permission to I don't know why it didn't have permission to it. That's what's weird.

01:23:49
<transcript>: is

01:23:52
<transcript>: Is. I looked like I gave it permission.

01:23:56
<transcript>: But here we are now I'm going to clean this up a little bit because.

01:23:56
<transcript>: this all

01:23:58
warrenbuffering: ohhhhhhhh, one of those

01:23:59
<transcript>: This all can now just go.

01:24:12
<transcript>: Same as last words. I'm just going to clean this up. No big deal. Just going to go in here and clean this up real quick. That won't cause any issues. I've never cleaned something up and caused code not to work.

01:24:22
mo_ali141: lol broken!

01:24:26
<transcript>: Okay, if you were logged in, why did it say gopro? Because git push turk. I just haven't made changes to make it nice. Nothing in the ui is really done yet. Something async. Oh, one of those. Yeah, it's one of those. Just importing. Lots of.

01:24:26
<transcript>: broken

01:24:28
<transcript>: Broken.

01:24:30
lazic88: Jesus, I hope that AWS DB is not publicly exposed LuL

01:24:32
<transcript>: Okay. The authorizer doesn't need to hit the database, so I never needed to do that.

01:24:32
<transcript>: cool

01:24:34
<transcript>: Cool.

01:24:40
bweezy224: LOL yes “I’ll clean this code later” 🤣

01:24:43
mhuggins7278: nothing like poking the gremlins live on stream :)

01:24:45
mo_ali141: Someone nmap it.

01:24:45
<transcript>: Watch it build successfully. Hope that aws. Dv is not publicly exposed. It is not lasik. I did not expose anything. I didn't expose anything.

01:24:45
<transcript>: i'll clean

01:24:47
<transcript>: I'll clean this code later.

01:24:57
<transcript>: I have not exposed anything. What did you think I expose it's also in a private subnet. And I'm only connecting through an ssh tunnel and a bastion host. So, Yeah.

01:24:57
<transcript>: i'm not worried

01:24:59
lazic88: RDS...

01:25:02
lazic88: But ok

01:25:03
<transcript>: I'm not worried about it, but also, I haven't even exposed anything. Have I? What did I expose.

01:25:08
<transcript>: Rds, but okay, what.

01:25:12
<transcript>: What are you talking about? Rds. Okay.

01:25:12
<transcript>: yeah

01:25:16
<transcript>: Yeah, it's an rds instance living in a private subnet in my vpc.

01:25:17
mo_ali141: In a public subnet?

01:25:21
<transcript>: What's the concern? I didn't leak anything. Did I listen.

01:25:21
<transcript>: i didn't

01:25:22
mo_ali141: Ahh.

01:25:23
lazic88: Sorry, nope. You're fine KEKW

01:25:24
<transcript>: I didn't leak anything. Okay, I need a break.

01:25:28
<transcript>: What? Did I leak? Oh, I'm fine. Okay, cool.

01:25:28
<transcript>: in a

01:25:29

01:25:33
<transcript>: In a public subnet. No, it's no private subnet. Yeah.

basileus__: I work in networking omegalul

01:25:48
lazic88: 11

01:25:54
mo_ali141: Bastion hosts?

01:25:55
<transcript>: You guys are funny. How much do we hate networking though? How much like this is the first time I've had to do like non serverless stuff in a while. Ew it's so not fun. I wasted so much time, like with bashing hosts and all that stuff. How do you set up the tunnel to bastion for local dev? It's mainly I'll show you here in a SEC when I go back to my screen.

01:25:55
<transcript>: is it

01:25:58
<transcript>: Is it snack time? It is snack time.

01:25:58
<transcript>: it

01:25:58
schrew: A lot. Networking was my worst class in college and continues to haunt me

01:26:00
<transcript>: It is in fact.

01:26:01

01:26:08
mo_ali141: If on ec2, just use SSM.

01:26:08
gitpush_gitpaid: that makes one of us. i tried serverless last night Kappa

01:26:12
<transcript>: You work in networking. Well, I'm sorry for that. Basilis from one to 1011.

01:26:16
<transcript>: How much do we hate it? Oh, yeah? We hated eleven.

01:26:16
<transcript>: i appreciate

01:26:18
<transcript>: I appreciate serverless so much more now.

01:26:27
<transcript>: Working with my worst class in College.

01:26:37
<transcript>: Yeah, I did the Advanced Networking Certification in aws and learned things I never want to learn or never wanted to learn.

01:26:41
<transcript>: About vpc, peering and Transit gateway.

01:26:41
<transcript>: and

01:26:44

01:26:52
2dorkstv: I wore a network hat for a while. I enjoyed it. Glad I did it overall, but happy I'm doing new stuff now :)

01:26:53
<transcript>: Stuff. I just don't. I don't need to know.

01:26:54
mo_ali141: Yeah, I now have to know that stuff.

01:26:55
ocelot2123: I'm doing that for work right now and I barely understand any of it LUL

01:27:00

01:27:04
warrenbuffering: So are you in AR or MO?

01:27:12
<transcript>: Molly, if it's on East Two, just use ssm. Yeah, I don't actually end up SSHing into EC two instances that much. I've just had to use the bash and host to get to my database.

01:27:16
<transcript>: But I know EC Two has some cool stuff like that where you can actually just click a button.

01:27:16
<transcript>: and you got

01:27:18
<transcript>: And you got a session.

01:27:25
<transcript>: We're network hat for a while. Oh, that's easy stuff.

01:27:25
<transcript>: bgp

01:27:28
mo_ali141: They really should make an SSM session for RDS too.

01:27:33
<transcript>: Bgp. Routing basilis bgb. That's it. You said it. Sorry. I thought I just. Oh, I did just remember it. And then I saw your chat. But I can't prove it.

01:27:41
<transcript>: I wore a Network hat for a while, enjoyed it, glad I did it overall, but happy I'm doing new stuff now. Tudor Works this year.

01:27:51
<transcript>: You have to know that stuff. I'm so sorry for you, for all of you that have to do this stuff. I guess I'm sorry for me because I have to do it too.

01:27:59
<transcript>: I'm doing that for work right now, and I barely understand any of it. Yeah, it's a lot worn buffering in my Arkansas or Missouri. I'm in Missouri.

01:27:59

01:28:07
<transcript>: Are you from the area? Warren buffering.

01:28:16
<transcript>: They should really make an ssm set for rds too. That'd be great. I'm just like a gui where I can just look at the tables and stuff.

01:28:16
<transcript>: because i'm a soy

01:28:24
<transcript>: Because I'm a soy Dev give me like a GUI in the ada vis console where I can just click a button and start exploring my rds database. I would love that so much.

warrenbuffering: SD now tho

01:28:41
<transcript>: Aws is a lot, but I think it's worth it. I think it's worth learning it's a lot, but it's worth it. If you're building stuff like with a team that you plan on working on for several years, I think it benefits you.

01:28:46

01:28:49
<transcript>: You want to live in Fayetteville.

01:29:51
bodhihawken: other day (a while ago XD)

01:30:01
<transcript>: To, like, Scout out South Dakota. And that's where my wife could have ended up. But on the way, they had to drive through the ozarks. And they fell in love with the ozarks. They moved there. We got married. The rest is history.

01:30:01
<transcript>: well

01:30:06

01:30:31
bodhihawken: like a couple  months

01:30:33
<transcript>: Are you also into Munry money laundering? Yeah. The ozarks. It's really put us on the map. My wife just traveled for the first time. Overland park. Yes. Sorry.

01:30:43
mo_ali141: Gotta go, have a good stream!

01:30:47
<transcript>: And every time she told people where she's from, I'm from the ozark. Like, how was the show, the show on Netflix? That's all I hear now when I tell people I'm from the ozarks, mostly in person, like, if I travel.

01:30:48
dnbull: i money launder with larabars

01:30:58
<transcript>: I love the show. Jason bateman. So good. And before that show, no one had any idea. I never said the ozarks because nobody had any frame of reference. So I just said, I'm from Missouri.

01:30:58
<transcript>: and

01:31:00
itsmeleague: I didnt know about the ozarks before the show lol

01:31:00

01:31:01
<transcript>: And they're like, Sorry, misery.

01:31:04
<transcript>: Magister. Thank you for the follow.

01:31:14
<transcript>: How similar is the ozarks to the TV show? Well, awful lot. I've not watched the TV show. I watched the first like three episodes.

01:31:24
<transcript>: And they did a pretty good job, like the river people in the first few episodes, like where they go down to the river and there's like meth labs or whatever. And there's just like people coming out of the Woods.

01:31:24
<transcript>: that's pretty

01:31:28
<transcript>: That's pretty accurate. You go to the river, then that's.

01:31:28
<transcript>: a pretty similar

01:31:30
<transcript>: A pretty similar scene.

01:31:33
dassemdota2: but the Ozark was not actually filmed in Ozark

01:31:34
bodhihawken: got a bunch of family just out of springdale

01:31:40
<transcript>: Definitely not as dramatic as the show. There is a lot of meth, though. So I'll tell you this. I went to high school in willow Springs, which is small town, like 2000 people.

01:31:40
<transcript>: and

01:31:43
<transcript>: And played all the sports.

01:31:43
<transcript>: one of

warrenbuffering: I feel like there's some spots that are close. Get in some of those back roads and there's corrugated steel "shacks" everywhere

01:31:54
<transcript>: One of our best friends, me and eli, My, co founder at samuels. We hung out with another friend, who was like a third best friend. We all spin. Each summer we spend at each other's houses.

01:31:54
<transcript>: grew up

01:31:59
<transcript>: Grew up together very close with this person didn't graduate high school and.

01:31:59
<transcript>: fell out

01:32:09
<transcript>: Fell out, like, dropped out our senior year off the football team, off basketball team. Everything because of a meth addiction. So meth is like a really bad problem in the Ozarks.

01:32:11
warrenbuffering: but it's also really beautiful for the most part

01:32:19
smilingbig: poor dude

01:32:22
<transcript>: A lot of mess, so multiple classmates of mine actually got addicted to meth before they made it to graduation in high school. So that's kind of what we deal with down here. Got to go, cmo. Ally, thanks so much for the raid for coming and hanging out.

01:32:23
itsmeleague: Dang

01:32:23
shane_codes: Thats pretty methed up

01:32:27
<transcript>: oh

01:32:29
<transcript>: Oh, wait.

01:32:29

01:32:37
<transcript>: You money launder with lara bars.

01:32:44
<transcript>: Didn't know about the ozarks for the show. Yeah, most people didn't.

01:32:51
<transcript>: Most people didn't. Ozark was not actually filmed in Ozark? No, I think it was filmed in Georgia, wasn't it.

01:32:57
<transcript>: A bunch of family just out of springdale, Arkansas. Okay.

01:33:05
<transcript>: Like there's some spots that are close get in some of those back roads. And there's Curgage Steel shacks everywhere. Yes, absolutely.

01:33:09
<transcript>: It is really beautiful. I mean, we have lots of Rivers and caves.

01:33:09
<transcript>: it's naturally

01:33:11
<transcript>: It's naturally, very beautiful.

01:33:20
<transcript>: There really is low cost of living relatively in the us.

01:33:24
<transcript>: I've got gigabit.

01:33:24
<transcript>: like up

01:33:29
<transcript>: Like up and down fiber to my office closet. Like right there.

01:33:34
<transcript>: So like I have no complaints.

01:33:34
<transcript>: we live

01:33:36
<transcript>: We live where we grew up.

01:33:39
<transcript>: I don't have a lot of friends in the area.

01:33:39
<transcript>: mostly

01:33:47
<transcript>: Mostly my friends are online, but like zuck is bringing the metaverse to us. So who needs real life friends, right.

01:33:50
<transcript>: That's pretty messed up. Yeah.

01:33:53
itsmeleague: Lol

01:33:55
<transcript>: Okay.

01:34:01
<transcript>: Where are we at now? So we got all that working now. I just got to get.

01:34:01
<transcript>: the

01:34:02
mhuggins7278: IRL is for the birds

01:34:03
alex14319999: True who needs irl friends LUL

01:34:03
<transcript>: The Web, hook.

01:34:05
smilingbig: KEKW prefer no friends to the metaverse

01:34:07
<transcript>: The webhook working.

01:34:11
<transcript>: Let's go back over here.

01:34:16
<transcript>: So in the webhook we have to update the user.

01:34:16
<transcript>: and say

01:34:21
<transcript>: And say it to our paid user when the checkout session complete thing comes right.

01:34:22
gitpush_gitpaid: @thdxr the hot reload issue seems to have been fixed on my end... still getting that wonky response

01:34:25
<transcript>: So this one. Let's do this.

01:34:26
camdickie: whats up adam! also never realized before, but your keyboard almost sounds ceramic

01:34:30
<transcript>: Was that the most recent one.

01:34:33
<transcript>: What Time zone is that.

01:34:33
<transcript>: pacific

01:34:34
<transcript>: Pacific time.

01:34:35
itsmeleague: Could you show the ssh tunnel to bastion for local dev?

01:34:40
camdickie: are you using the same thing dax is with the fake typing

01:34:44
<transcript>: I guess so. Oh, yeah, it's me League. I'll show you the tunnel here. So the tunnel.

01:34:47
itsmeleague: Tyty

01:34:50
<transcript>: Noisy. Oh, I don't want to leak any secrets here. Okay, here's the command.

01:34:58
adamdotdev: ssh -i ~/.ssh/bastion-sm.pem -p 60694 -L 5433:mothra-staging.proxy-czmqfqtpf0dx.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432 -v ec2-user@52.22.31.45 -N

01:34:59
<transcript>: I'm going to just paste it because you don't have the pin. You don't have the private key.

01:34:59
<transcript>: so maybe

01:35:02
<transcript>: So maybe you can do something with that. But.

01:35:10
<transcript>: That's the command I use to set up an ssh tunnel through our bastion host and hit our already proxy, which is in a private subnet.

01:35:14
<transcript>: So if you want me to just kind of break it down real quick.

01:35:16
<transcript>: Let me go back up here.

01:35:21
<transcript>: So this is where we pass in.

01:35:21
<transcript>: the

01:35:23
<transcript>: The private key.

01:35:23
<transcript>: every time i do

01:35:24
smilingbig: tune

01:35:25
<transcript>: Every time I do that, it's going to okay, whatever.

01:35:29
shane_codes: Man I have not watched your stream for ~a month, you should totally do a retrospective on how far this app has come. Looking good compared to a couple weeks back.

01:35:43
<transcript>: There's the Port, which is not we don't use 22. I don't know why. So that's the Port on our bastion host that we can hit for ssh sessions. Then we have local Port 54 33 because 54. 32 is in use by the local postgres.

01:35:43
<transcript>: this is the

01:35:46
<transcript>: This is the rds proxy host.

01:35:56
devtechnica: shameless self promotion. https://github.com/sreedevk/aws-ssh I wrote this script that let's you ssh into aws instances real fast (with option to setup a bastion jump server)

01:35:56
<transcript>: Okay. And then the rds proxy Port, which is the default postgres Port. And then I've got verbose output on and then EC two user at that's the public IP for our bastion host.

01:36:00
itsmeleague: Makes sense

01:36:03
<transcript>: That's it so that's how we connect through our bash and host, and I can hit locally.

01:36:08
<transcript>: I can hit the sql Server or the rds thing.

01:36:11
itsmeleague: Thank you

01:36:14
<transcript>: Tune Man I have not watched your stream for a month. You should totally do a retroduction on how far this app has come.

01:36:14
<transcript>: we can

01:36:35
<transcript>: We can go compare to a couple of weeks ago. Thanks, Shane. Yeah. So stat muse, we're rewriting it. We're rewriting it in astro. But right now I'm actually working on the existing app because we're going to add stripe payments. While I work on the rewrite, we're going to get it out there. Debt technica. Welcome to Chat. Shameless. Self promotion. Aws, ssh.

01:36:35
<transcript>: i wrote

01:36:39
<transcript>: I wrote the script that lets you ssh and awareness real fast.

01:36:40
<transcript>: Cool.

01:36:40
<transcript>: options

01:36:44
<transcript>: Options to set up a jump server.

01:36:48
<transcript>: That's what they call them. In Australia, right. Jump, servers.

01:36:48
<transcript>: we call them

01:36:50
<transcript>: We call them bashing Hosts. Here.

01:36:50
<transcript>: you call them

01:36:56
silverlp: After that a backend rewrite in rust? Kappa

01:36:58
<transcript>: You call them Jump servers. That's kind of cool. I like Jump server. That's way. Cooler. Wheelbarrow, weasel, and Alex, thank you for the follows.

01:36:58
<transcript>: appreciate

01:37:07
<transcript>: Appreciate those after that. Back end, rewrite and rust. That's right. A dip from Tower. Thank you for the follow. So this is cool. Let's look at this.

01:37:16
<transcript>: Aws ssh starred connect to AWS EC two instances at lightning speed should have gone with blazingly, but that's okay.

01:37:16
<transcript>: just kidding

01:37:17
<transcript>: Just kidding.

01:37:17
<transcript>: basket

01:37:19
<transcript>: Basketball.

01:37:28
<transcript>: As the FJQ and AWS cli under the hood. So what's the api look like? I just say, AWS, ssh list.

01:37:28
<transcript>: partial

01:37:34
<transcript>: Partial search germ there's your fzf usage and then connect.

01:37:34
<transcript>: with a user

01:37:35
<transcript>: With a username.

01:37:38
<transcript>: And then I can use.

01:37:38
<transcript>: i can

01:37:54
<transcript>: I can add private keys here. Cool. And bastion server is configured here. Okay. So I can go into the config file. Oh, here's the example private key bash. And I love it. I love it. So just save me a lot of typing. I could just be like, aws, ssh, boom.

01:37:54
<transcript>: bo

01:38:02
<transcript>: Boom can I put like shortcut so this is just for EC two instances, or does it work for rds? Like an rds proxy.

01:38:09
devtechnica: only for ec2 instances for now

01:38:10
<transcript>: Because that would be cool. But even if it's just EC two, that's super cool. Thank you for thank you for posting that Dev.

01:38:11
<transcript>: Okay.

01:38:11
<transcript>: let's see

01:38:13
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:38:20
devtechnica: everybody at my company uses it . i wrote it for my company

01:38:21
<transcript>: After that. Only for EC genesis. Now. No, this is still super helpful. Maybe I'll submit a PR at some point.

01:38:21
<transcript>: maybe i'll

01:38:24
<transcript>: Maybe I'll submit a PR to add support for.

01:38:24
<transcript>: rds

01:38:30
<transcript>: Rds instances, and then I'll submit another PR to add support for rds proxies.

01:38:33
<transcript>: That's awesome. It really is.

01:38:33
<transcript>: it clearly

01:38:35
<transcript>: It clearly saves time.

01:38:35

01:38:40

01:42:54
<transcript>: technically sue

01:42:55
devtechnica: if you don't test on prod. are you even testing?

01:43:01
<transcript>: Technically sue you for leaking their info? I don't know, turk. Let's not find out, okay? Maybe if this just stayed in our little circle here.

01:43:24
<transcript>: so

01:43:26
cowfacedev: well, your vod will have them LUL

01:43:28

01:43:29
<transcript>: So what's going on now? Is this prod? How can I find out if this is prod.

01:43:38
<transcript>: Count one instead of count. But I bet it's still slow.

01:43:39
<transcript>: Clipping time.

01:43:44
<transcript>: Let's just look at the tunnel. Let's just look at the tunnel that I just stood up.

01:43:44
<transcript>: let's just see

01:43:49
devtechnica: count limit 1000?

01:43:49
<transcript>: Let's just see it's staging. It's definitely staging. There's just a lot more data and staging than I realize.

01:43:53
<transcript>: Mothrasaging proxy. Yeah, it's definitely staging.

01:43:54
techsavvytravvy: unless staging db got synced with prod at some point?

01:43:56
<transcript>: Unless.

01:43:59
<transcript>: Oh boy.

01:44:05
<transcript>: Hang on, wait for it. Let's look at the proxy.

01:44:16
jenswoeste: LUL

01:44:21
<transcript>: It's possible. I will not put it outside of the realm of possibility that I set up the proxy to point to the wrong database. No, it's correct Mothra stage. Okay, it's from 2020. Apparently, we just did like a database backup of prod in 2020. And that's what staging is now. So it's still huge.

01:44:21
mattmancodes: LUL

<transcript>: Oh, that's so good.

01:44:53
cowfacedev: LUL

01:44:57
ocelot2123: @bodhihawken we've probably all done something similar to that once in our careers LUL

<transcript>: Welcome to my Chat Stamp. He's great. Brune. Thank you for the follow. Oh, my goodness, it's you cool pants. That is too good.

01:45:11
<transcript>: Yeah also.

01:45:11
<transcript>: we've all

01:45:16
daglee: What did I miss?

01:45:17
<transcript>: We've all crashed prod at some point might delete the VOD felt cute? Might delete the VOD.

01:45:20
<transcript>: Oh, man, everything is fine.

01:45:21
cowfacedev: and you got flagged as suspicious user @statmuse_greg LUL

01:45:22
<transcript>: Dagley.

01:45:22
<transcript>: i

01:45:26
bodhihawken: @bodhihawken yeah that and deleted the api gateway XD

01:45:30
<transcript>: I may have leaked some random person with my last name's email because I was doing a search to check the user table for my email address.

01:45:36
<transcript>: And somebody made a fake user called Satmus. Greg, because this person was named Greg. Elmore.

01:45:42
<transcript>: And they made a fake account. Sap news Greg and came in with a zinger.

01:45:46
<transcript>: Okay and deleted the api gateway. That sucks.

01:45:46
<transcript>: that's

01:45:50
<transcript>: That's not a fun feeling doesn't feel good.

01:45:53
fragaverage: O.o who's @statmuse_greg

01:46:00
fragaverage: seems sus

01:46:06
<transcript>: Who stabbed you? Greg? It's a joke, frag. I leaked Greg elmore's email address. Seems sus. Yeah, okay.

01:46:11
<transcript>: So what's the problem here? We are definitely connected to saging. That's not a problem.

01:46:11
<transcript>: the

01:46:13
<transcript>: The question is.

01:46:15
<transcript>: Is our app connected to staging.

01:46:15
<transcript>: oh

01:46:17
bodhihawken: yeah i now use custom domains on gateways for a reason

01:46:17
<transcript>: Oh no.

01:46:20
<transcript>: Oh.

01:46:20
<transcript>: no

01:46:22
<transcript>: No, wait a minute.

01:46:24
<transcript>: Wait a minute.

01:46:27
<transcript>: Are we looking at different databases.

01:46:30
<transcript>: That's what it is.

01:46:30
<transcript>: okay

01:46:33
gitpush_gitpaid: dax got jim, adam got greg

01:46:35
<transcript>: Okay. So this is connected to oh, I got to go seek. I got to go fuzzy. Hang on.

01:46:35
<transcript>: i bet dev

01:46:40
<transcript>: I bet dev is connected to like a local postgres. That's totally what it is.

01:46:44
mattmancodes: Dev against prod?

01:46:46
<transcript>: I didn't even need to set up the tunnel. I could have just been hitting.

01:46:46
<transcript>: a local

01:46:47
<transcript>: A local.

01:46:57
<transcript>: Database Dev against prod. No Dev is not against prod it's Dev is against a local postgres instance, not the RDS instance. And I'm just dumb.

01:46:59
<transcript>: Okay.

01:47:03
longhumans: By the power of Greg! I summon one free (alleged) macbook!

01:47:07
<transcript>: So then what I need to do is I'm going to update. I'm actually going to update local.

01:47:07
<transcript>: to hit

01:47:09
<transcript>: To Hit staging.

01:47:09
<transcript>: is that

01:47:11
<transcript>: Is that bad.

01:47:15
aisebaxp: I want that fuzzy plug-in adamdevFuzzy adamdevKappa

01:47:15
<transcript>: It is bad because I haven't earned migrations in staging.

01:47:15
longhumans: dang

01:47:18
mattmancodes: Ok, that's better than prod.

01:47:21
<transcript>: Thinking. Let me just confirm I'm doing a lot of thinking without confirming.

01:47:23
<transcript>: Let's open up.

01:47:23
<transcript>: text n

01:47:25
<transcript>: Text Nate.

01:47:37
<transcript>: And let's look at what dev is pointed at. It is pointed at. No. Oh, wait. Oh, that's Sports reference. Yeah. Here we go. Db host or localhost mothradev. There it is. Okay.

01:47:41
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:47:51
<transcript>: So my new API is connected to the staging database, but my local instance is connected to Dev.

01:47:54
<transcript>: That's way better than prod.

01:47:54
<transcript>: i want that fuzzy

01:48:00
<transcript>: I want that fuzzy plugin. It's not actually a plug in seba. It's just you just make like a filter.

01:48:04
<transcript>: I could try and find the video rocks is the one that I stole it from.

01:48:10
<transcript>: I now use custom domains on gateways for a reason. Dax got Jim. Adam got Greg. Exactly.

01:48:16
aisebaxp: Ok I will look into it

01:48:16
<transcript>: By the power of Greg, I summoned one free, alleged macbook Long Humans. I love it.

01:48:16
<transcript>: dang

01:48:18
<transcript>: Dang.

01:48:19
<transcript>: Okay.

01:48:24
mattmancodes: For the filter - https://www.lucecarter.co.uk/blog/how-to-achieve-a-pixellated-secrets-scene-in-obs-for-windows

01:48:25
<transcript>: I got to think about this. Everyone. I need your help. I actually need your help.

01:48:34
<transcript>: I need you people's help you people help me help me? What do I want to do here.

01:48:34
<transcript>: some

01:48:38
<transcript>: Some actual garbage. Thank you for that follow. I feel like you're not giving yourself enough credit.

01:48:43
<transcript>: So here's the question. Oh, somebody linked it. Thank you, Matt. Man.

01:48:43
<transcript>: the question

01:48:45
<transcript>: The question is.

01:48:54

01:48:54
ocelot2123: help you email greg?

01:48:56
daglee: You people? Are you racist against dutch people again?

01:48:59
lazic88: Okay

01:49:05
<transcript>: Okay, I have my local postgres database. I've run the migration on it to add a couple of columns that are necessary for my new feature work. I have not touched staging with my new migrations. Okay. Staging still is in whatever state it was last tested. Somebody built something and used staging. Okay, staging.

01:49:11
<transcript>: Not including I could run the migrations against staging. Here's my question. Should I.

01:49:11
<transcript>: run

01:49:21
<transcript>: Run my migrations against staging, update that database and start testing against staging locally. So both my apps hitting the staging database.

01:49:21
<transcript>: or should i

01:49:24
<transcript>: Or should I just update.

01:49:24
<transcript>: my sst

01:49:33
mattmancodes: Local

01:49:33
<transcript>: My sst app to hit my local postgres database and test everything locally, I feel like the obvious answer is test locally, but what do you guys think.

01:49:34
mano_rocha: no, just git push --force origin/master Kappa

01:49:35
ocelot2123: local

01:49:36
<transcript>: You people. Are you racist? No, I'm really not. I.

01:49:36
<transcript>: just i

markusla2: local

01:49:40
aisebaxp: @mattmancodes thank you!!! manzdevLove

01:49:46
<transcript>: Just. I started saying, you people, and then it just kind of became, like, the way I referenced you all I could call you all chat, like, hey, Chad, I need help. It just feels so like, I don't know.

01:49:47
<transcript>: Inhuman.

01:49:47
<transcript>: you are

01:49:51
<transcript>: You are people. So when I say you people.

01:49:55
<transcript>: I'm not referring to chatters. I'm referring to human beings.

01:49:55
<transcript>: you're real

01:50:00
<transcript>: You're real human beings. You know what I'm saying? So it's not a racist thing.

01:50:00
<transcript>: it's a fact

01:50:00
laytanl_: If others are using staging they will have the database but not the code changes?

01:50:02
<transcript>: It's a fact. You are people.

01:50:02
<transcript>: do we have any

01:50:05
<transcript>: Do we have any votes? Oh, maybe I'll put it to a vote.

<transcript>: i don't

01:50:24
cowfacedev: time to create a poll.

01:50:27
<transcript>: I don't know what that means. If others are using staging, they will have the database, but not the code changes. Yeah. Layton. Good call.

01:50:34
<transcript>: We're just five engineers, but I don't need to go borking other people's thing. I'm a robot. Oh, awesome. That's a robot. So I.

01:50:34
<transcript>: guess

01:50:39
<transcript>: Guess I should say you people and robots hambone is people.

01:50:39
<transcript>: but

01:50:44
<transcript>: But hambone, welcome to Chat, by the way. Hambon said it in a way that sounds like a bot.

01:50:51
<transcript>: Also, that said, I'm a robot in a way that sounds like a human. And hambone said, I am people, which sounds like a bot. That's funny.

01:50:53
mattmancodes: people I am

01:50:53
<transcript>: Check for local.

01:50:56
<transcript>: We're just not on his level.

01:51:07
<transcript>: Real human beings. Time to create a poll. Okay. Do I need to pull? I mean, we could just because it's fun to do pulse. Sometimes. Let's just see what you guys say when I do a poll question.

01:51:12
<transcript>: Should I use local postgres or staging.

01:51:14
<transcript>: Local.

01:51:16
<transcript>: Staging.

01:51:16
<transcript>: here

01:51:19
<transcript>: Here we go. Start the poll.

01:51:23
mhuggins7278: it's fun to do poll but there is only 1 correct answer

01:51:26
<transcript>: Service error. Try again in a moment. Well, now I'm over the pole. It's just not working.

01:51:29
<transcript>: I could refresh the page.

01:51:36
<transcript>: It's fun to do a poll, but there's only one correct answer. I think you're right.

01:51:36
<transcript>: i don't know why

01:51:41
<transcript>: I don't know why twitch is not letting me do a poll. I'm going to try again because polls are fun.

01:51:41
<transcript>: maybe i can

01:51:45
<transcript>: Maybe I can make the poll fun? How can I make the poll fun? I could say should I.

01:51:49
<transcript>: Test locally or hit staging.

01:51:50
ocelot2123: see a robot would want you to think its people MrDestructoid

01:51:52
mattmancodes: Is the poll pointing to Staging Twitch or local? LUL

01:51:53
<transcript>: Local.

01:51:53
<transcript>: it's safer

01:51:54
<transcript>: It's safer.

01:51:57
<transcript>: Staging yellow.

01:52:01
mhuggins7278: should i test locally or break everyone else

01:52:05
<transcript>: Okay. I don't know what I gained from using staging. I don't know why I even made this a question, because I can't think of a pro.

01:52:05
<transcript>: everybody

01:52:07
<transcript>: Everybody's going to say staging now, aren't they.

01:52:12
<transcript>: Should I test locally or break everyone else? That's the question.

01:52:14
<transcript>: That's the real question.

01:52:14
<transcript>: it wouldn't actually

01:52:19
<transcript>: It wouldn't actually break anybody. I've just added two columns to a table. No one would notice.

01:52:25
<transcript>: But I also can't think of a single reason why I shouldn't just do it locally.

01:52:29
<transcript>: Do you know why it is sunk cost fallacy the only reason.

01:52:34
<transcript>: I kind of wanted to go to staging is because I did all that work to set up the ssh tunnel.

01:52:35
bodhihawken: you should start doing channel point gambling for wether a test will fail or work XD

01:52:38
<transcript>: That's it that's the only reason.

01:52:38
<transcript>: you should start

01:52:43
xor_xor: "no one would notice" famous last words

01:52:46
<transcript>: You should start doing ChannelPoint gambling for whether a test will fail or work. Ooh, bodie, yeah, we should start doing some gambling.

01:52:46
<transcript>: no

01:52:51
mattmancodes: "no one would notice" - the famous last words before the entire company starts complaining

01:52:51
cowfacedev: equalize the polls

01:52:56
ocelot2123: gambling for a macbook

01:52:58
<transcript>: No one would notice? Yeah, it's so true. Xor xor? Welcome to Chat. How many times in my career I've been like, It's just like a one line change? What could go wrong.

01:53:00
<transcript>: Prod goes down.

01:53:00
<transcript>: i did a lot of

01:53:07
<transcript>: I did a lot of consulting and the number of times I was pretty young working for financial tech firms.

01:53:10
bodhihawken: hahaha true. the doubters will always win XD

01:53:21
<transcript>: And I don't know how anybody kept me employed because I know I did it so many times. I'm in a hurry. I was kind of like a triage. Early on. I was like a triage person who's dealing with all the production issues and just like fixing stuff and flying around. But.

01:53:21
<transcript>: i'd be really

01:53:31
<transcript>: I'd be really busy or I need to get somewhere, like, personally, we're going somewhere and it's like, oh, just one last thing. I just got to fix this pine real quick and make one change. Like, I'm not going to test it. I'm just going to ship it.

01:53:31
<transcript>: and then everything

01:53:38
<transcript>: And then everything goes crashing down, and then you're there sitting there for an hour because you have to fix the mess you created orca.

01:53:38
<transcript>: thank you so much

01:53:42
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the follow. I do not miss the early stages of my career.

01:53:42
<transcript>: i'm realizing

01:53:51
<transcript>: I'm realizing now how much my career has turned into. I get to sit around and have fun because I did a lot of hardware work. I think that is I think it's well and I got lucky. But.

01:53:51
devtechnica: oh I did that in startups. and I almost always mess up when I don't test locally

01:53:55
<transcript>: I got to do some fun things in my early stage, but mostly.

01:53:55
<transcript>: a lot of not

01:53:58
<transcript>: A lot of not fun things. A lot of hard work.

01:53:58
<transcript>: and now

01:54:01
<transcript>: And now I do this.

01:54:05
<transcript>: Okay. No one would notice.

01:54:05
<transcript>: the

01:54:09
bweezy224: Yeah those times are not fun at all!,

01:54:14
<transcript>: The famous last words for the entire company starts complaining exactly equalize the polls. Gambling for a macbook. Oh, yeah, there's already gambling.

01:54:25
<transcript>: I did that in startups, and I almost always mess up what I don't test locally. It's so true. Dev. Sometimes the cost to test locally is high, and you just want to try, just want yellow. Okay.

01:54:30
<transcript>: I'm going to go to local. We're going to make everything just point to local.

01:54:37
<transcript>: I'm just trying to find the username and password. Cool. Okay. I'm going to add the let's see.

01:54:40
<transcript>: I'm going to go unfuzzy.

01:54:40
<transcript>: i'm going to go

01:54:40
bodhihawken: haha, yeah i did it yesterday with an AI Report, not a good idea

01:54:43
<transcript>: I'm going to go unfuzzy so you guys can see.

01:54:43
<transcript>: what

01:54:45
<transcript>: What I'm doing.

01:54:54
<transcript>: Let's see, I need.

01:54:54
<transcript>: to change what

01:54:57
<transcript>: To change? What is it that I need to change.

01:55:05
<transcript>: Oh, it's right here. Literally, right here, localhost. And then the Port is always going to be 54, 32.

01:55:06
devtechnica: step 1: find a bug. step 2: quick fix step 3: stay up all night fixing the quick fix

01:55:11
<transcript>: Okay, so now my SST app should be pointing to local.

01:55:16
<transcript>: What else was pointing to staging, though, was anything else? Oh.

01:55:16
<transcript>: this

01:55:20
<transcript>: This psql session. So let's do this.

01:55:25
daglee: Somebody at a swedish bank pushed an update on a friday afternoon and then went home. On saturday people noticed that you could get a random account when you logged in. As long as you didn't do worse than that, you are fine.

01:55:32
<transcript>: I mean, I need this. I'm just going to leave it on mother stage for now because I may not need it once my code just starts working. Step one, find a bug. Step two, quick fix. Step three, step all night. Fixing the quick fix. Exactly.

01:55:32
<transcript>: somebody

01:55:46
<transcript>: Somebody at a Swedish Bank pushed an update on Friday afternoon, then went home on Saturday, people noticed that you could get a random account when you logged in. Oh, my word. As long as you didn't do worse than that, that's bad. That's a bad day for everyone involved.

01:55:49
<transcript>: Okay, let's replay the webhook. What do you say.

01:55:51
<transcript>: What do you say.

01:55:56
<transcript>: Replay it, resend it and we should get data. Now.

01:55:56
<transcript>: look at it

01:55:58
<transcript>: Look at it. Look at the data.

01:55:58
<transcript>: look at it

01:56:02
<transcript>: Look at it. Go. Here comes. Nope. Fatal exception.

01:56:04
<transcript>: What.

01:56:06
<transcript>: Root does not exist.

01:56:08
<transcript>: I'm probably using the wrong.

01:56:08
<transcript>: okay

01:56:12
bluearrowredbird: Not Knight Capital bad though....

01:56:16
<transcript>: Okay. I did not expect a hard crash. That's kind of a bummer. Let's go to the code here.

01:56:16
mk_slug: What is the app namw

01:56:18
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:56:20
<transcript>: So.

01:56:20
<transcript>: process

01:56:22
<transcript>: Process. Let's see Port.

01:56:26
<transcript>: Host. And then we have the credentials. Okay. So these are.

01:56:26
<transcript>: going to be

01:56:28
<transcript>: Going to be different.

01:56:28
<transcript>: they're going to be

01:56:29
<transcript>: They're going to be different.

01:56:33
<transcript>: Okay. So here's what we're going to do.

01:56:33
<transcript>: process

01:56:39
<transcript>: Process M rds proxy DB.

01:56:48
<transcript>: Four. Okay, and then process in RDS proxy user.

01:56:48
<transcript>: four

01:56:49
<transcript>: Four, and then.

01:56:54
<transcript>: Process in rds proxy.

01:56:54
<transcript>: prox

01:57:00
<transcript>: Proxy password four so we can override with environment variables.

01:57:00
<transcript>: and

01:57:02
<transcript>: And I can go back.

01:57:05
<transcript>: Here.

01:57:09
<transcript>: No, Yes.

01:57:09
<transcript>: right

01:57:09
devtechnica: you have cursive fonts setup with vim?! whyyyyyy

01:57:14
<transcript>: Right here. So this I can override I can say RDS.

01:57:17
<transcript>: Proxy.

01:57:17
<transcript>: database

01:57:18
<transcript>: Database.

01:57:20
mattmancodes: why not?

01:57:22
<transcript>: Is.

01:57:23
zerkbtw: what app is this?

01:57:25
<transcript>: Let's go up here.

01:57:29
<transcript>: So.

01:57:33
<transcript>: Db name maybe.

01:57:38
<transcript>: If it's stage production.

01:57:38
<transcript>: then

01:57:40
<transcript>: Then we're going to go with.

01:57:46
<transcript>: Mothra.

01:57:48
<transcript>: No, actually, we're only going to change it from mine.

01:57:51
<transcript>: For Adam.

01:57:51
<transcript>: it's going to

01:57:52
devtechnica: @mattmancodes fair play lol

01:57:52
<transcript>: It's going to be.

01:57:59
<transcript>: And otherwise it's going to be undefined.

01:58:03
<transcript>: Then we're going to do DB user.

01:58:05
<transcript>: Same thing.

01:58:10
<transcript>: This is going to be postgres.

01:58:12
<transcript>: Then DB.

01:58:14
<transcript>: Password.

01:58:19
<transcript>: Okay. And that down here we're going to say.

01:58:21
<transcript>: Db name.

01:58:25
<transcript>: And then rds proxy.

01:58:28
<transcript>: User.

01:58:28
<transcript>: pb

01:58:30
<transcript>: Pb, user.

01:58:30
<transcript>: and then

01:58:34
<transcript>: And then rds proxy password.

01:58:37
<transcript>: Db password.

01:58:44
<transcript>: String. Undefined. No, it could be undefined, though. And I want to leave it undefined.

01:58:44
<transcript>: i guess instead

01:58:47
<transcript>: I guess instead of undefined, we'll do empty string.

01:58:52
<transcript>: Okay, cool.

01:58:52
<transcript>: maybe

01:58:53
<transcript>: Maybe.

01:58:56
<transcript>: Oh, there's an extra.

01:59:02
<transcript>: Let's see if that deploys. Oh, no, it's not going to preampe run Dev.

01:59:08
<transcript>: Cool. What app is this? Zerk? It is statmus.com.

01:59:08
<transcript>: stat

01:59:08
mk_slug: What is this app for real LUL

01:59:08
lcravo: !elixitr

01:59:10
<transcript>: Status.

01:59:11
lcravo: !elixir

01:59:12
fossabot: Statmuse uses Elixir because an early engineer particularly enjoyed it. It's a great language and an intro to functional programming so you should check it out https://elixir-lang.org/

01:59:14
<transcript>: You're so close.

01:59:14
<transcript>: there you

01:59:21
<transcript>: There you go. El cravo. Welcome to Chat. What is this app? For real? It is for Real status.

01:59:21
<transcript>: cursive

01:59:24
<transcript>: Cursive font set up in vim. Yes.

01:59:28
<transcript>: It is okay.

01:59:28
<transcript>: and you haven't seen

01:59:34
<transcript>: And you haven't seen a lot of elixir because I'm bouncing around. We're doing Elixir and typescript today.

01:59:38
<transcript>: But the app is mostly written in elixir.

01:59:38
<transcript>: okay here

01:59:40
<transcript>: Okay. Here we go. Resend.

01:59:41
mk_slug: Wait you  are owner of multimilion dollar company?

01:59:44
<transcript>: Webhook coming in hot.

01:59:50
<transcript>: Mother stage does not exist. Well, who's trying to connect the Mothra stage.

01:59:57
<transcript>: Who's trying to connect the mother stage? I said, Mother Dev.

02:00:01
<transcript>: devra

02:00:01

<transcript>: Is.

02:00:29
<transcript>: Proxy db. Oh, the database name. Yeah, that's not it. What was it.

02:00:32
itsmeleague: You said PROXY_DB in one spot

02:00:34
<transcript>: Proxy database.

02:00:36
<transcript>: Database.

02:00:39
<transcript>: Data.

02:00:41
<transcript>: database

02:00:42
<transcript>: Database.

02:00:46
itsmeleague: And PROXY_DATABSE in other

02:00:49
itsmeleague: Ye that

02:00:56
<transcript>: Yeah, thank you, thank you. It's me League. You're on top of it. Wait. You are owner of multimillion Dollar Company. I am mk slug.

02:00:56
<transcript>: i mean i don't

02:01:03
<transcript>: I mean, I don't own as much as I used to, but I'm a co founder of stamus.com.

02:01:03
<transcript>: yeah

02:01:11
<transcript>: Yeah, I think we were last valued at like 35 million after our A. Actually, I don't even know. I don't know what our latest 409 A came in at.

02:01:11
<transcript>: i think we

02:01:15
zerkbtw: what is statmuse? elevator pitch?

02:01:16
<transcript>: I think we had another one with our Series B. I just wasn't really in that conversation.

02:01:25
<transcript>: Okay. We've raised, like 20 million. What does that mean? It is sport. Look at that. It worked. It worked.

02:01:25
<transcript>: it

02:01:28
mk_slug: Bro so rich he dont know how much is it worth

02:01:34
<transcript>: It worked. So statute, I'll show you here, stat means we started with just NBA, but it's basically like a sports knowledge base.

02:01:40
<transcript>: There you go. How many hormones did.

02:01:40
<transcript>: barry bond

02:01:47
<transcript>: Barry Bond said on tuesdays against mariners. So you can ask questions about sports and we answer them.

02:01:51
<transcript>: And that's basically it.

02:02:03
<transcript>: Bro so rich, you don't know how much it is worth. Well, I don't own as much as I used to. I sold a lot of my steak in sap, muse to new investors when I left the company back in 2000.

02:02:12
<transcript>: And 19 and then I'm back since like six months ago I rejoined after a three year hiatus.

02:02:14
warrenbuffering: Oooo, fun question. Are stats ruining baseball?

02:02:22
<transcript>: I own some of it. I used to own a lot of it. Our stats ruining baseball. Great question, Warren.

02:02:27
<transcript>: Are you saying, like, fun question to ask sammy's? Because sammy's doesn't really ask things like that.

02:02:27
<transcript>: are stats

02:02:32
<transcript>: Are stats ruining baseball? I don't think it's going to answer this.

02:02:32
<transcript>: i didn't

02:02:35
<transcript>: I didn't understand the question. Yeah.

02:02:36
warrenbuffering: no your opinion

02:02:37
<transcript>: You might have just been asking me, though.

02:02:37
<transcript>: and here's

02:02:40
<transcript>: And here's the answer. Oh, my opinion. Warren.

02:02:40
<transcript>: baseball

02:02:47
<transcript>: Baseball is ruining baseball because nobody cares. I'm sorry.

02:02:47
<transcript>: as someone

02:02:49
warrenbuffering: hahahahahahahahaha

02:02:52
<transcript>: As someone who works on a sports, consumer facing brand and product.

02:02:53
warrenbuffering: F

02:02:53
mattmancodes: haha

02:03:07
silverlp: american sport lul

02:03:11
zerkbtw: whart about hockey?

02:03:12
<transcript>: Nobody cares about baseball. It's just like the numbers of people who search baseball stuff. And it's a stat driven sport. So you'd think, like Stat muse would have a lot of sports, baseball questions. Not so much because just nobody cares. I don't know. It is hard to watch. I used to love watching the Cardinals. I mean, you're from Kansas City. I don't know if you're a Royal fan. I used to love.

02:03:12
<transcript>: watching

02:03:15
<transcript>: Watching the Cardinals being.

02:03:15
<transcript>: a south

02:03:17
goodgrandpaa: Good day everyone :)

02:03:18
<transcript>: A Southwest Missouri native.

02:03:18
<transcript>: and

02:03:26
<transcript>: And they won a couple of Super Bowl or Super Bowl. They won a couple of World Series, the pooh Holes days. I guess he's back now, but Yeah.

02:03:28
<transcript>: I just have a hard time.

02:03:29
zerkbtw: "How many slapshots did victor hedman have this season"

02:03:35
coolpantstv: Most baseball fans are boomers, aren't using statmuse

02:03:41
<transcript>: Baseball in the fall, like playoff baseball is fun. Like a good pitcher duel. Sure. I'll sit there for 3 hours or whatever and watch nothing happen and that's actually exciting, but like a regular season game.

02:03:41
<transcript>: like in

02:03:49
<transcript>: Like in the middle of the summer, when the Cardinals are playing the padres or whatever. Who cares? Just who cares? I can't get into it.

02:03:49
<transcript>: what about

02:03:52
<transcript>: What about hockey? So hockey.

02:04:00
<transcript>: Is more recently kind of gone under a stat revolution, right. In the last five years or so, stats have really become like a big.

02:04:00
<transcript>: thing in

02:04:01
warrenbuffering: fair, fair

02:04:03
<transcript>: Thing in Hockey, Advanced stats.

02:04:03
<transcript>: how many

02:04:09
<transcript>: How many slap shots did Victor Hedman have this season? I don't know if we have data on slapshots, but let's just try it. Zerk.

02:04:09
<transcript>: let's just

02:04:11
<transcript>: Let's just try it.

02:04:22
<transcript>: We get more hockey questions than you would think. There's a big daily fantasy crowd, nine goals, 40 assists, and a plus match. So we don't know what slapshots are. I guess we don't have that data.

02:04:23
orca2040: You like baseball and kind of look like mr.beast. Are you his brother? Kappa

02:04:27
<transcript>: But we do have some stats for his season, I guess.

02:04:31
zerkbtw: love the art

02:04:37
<transcript>: Most baseball fans are boomers aren't using stabbings. That's very true. Cool pants. Very true. Yeah. I'm sure there's a lot more baseball fans than we see.

02:04:37
<transcript>: but

02:04:38
silverlp: where does that data usually come from?

02:04:42
zerkbtw: is that all automated?

02:04:44
<transcript>: But I guess it's maybe not as big into daily fantasy. I don't know. We get a lot of daily fantasy people that use Status for hockey.

02:04:48
adamdotdev: !data

02:04:48
fossabot: StatMuse gets real-time data from SportRadar, but all the historical data was collected by Justin Kubatko, creator of Basketball-Reference.com, who worked as the lead statistician for Statmuse for several years. Read more here: https://www.statmuse.com/product/data

02:04:51
<transcript>: Love the art. Where does that data usually come from? So data. There you go.

02:04:51
<transcript>: is that

02:04:53
<transcript>: Is that all automated.

02:04:53
<transcript>: the art

02:04:55
adamdotdev: !players

02:04:55
fossabot: The player illustrations on statmuse.com are illustrated by the magnificent Michael Walchalk (https://www.michaelwalchalkdesign.com/).

02:05:12
<transcript>: The art. It's funny. You should ask. We have a command for all this players, I think. Yeah. So the illustrations are all illustrated by someone named Michael Walchock. He's fantastic. And he's worked at Sat me's longer than I have. He's been there like, seven, eight years now. And all he does every day is illustrate these players. We have a giant Gallery.

02:05:20
<transcript>: Of like thousands and thousands of illustrations he's made across the four North American Sports. Five sports. Now we have.

02:05:20
<transcript>: we

02:05:31
silverlp: oh cool

02:05:32
<transcript>: We have PGA as well, golf, so literally. This is what he does all day. We have the largest collection of player illustrations in the world, which is not hard to do because no one else is trying.

02:05:32
goodgrandpaa: Throwback to when Albert Pujols was in the Benchwarmers LUL

02:05:33
zerkbtw: is he open to contract work? lol

02:05:35
<transcript>: But we have this pretty cool.

02:05:35
<transcript>: library

02:05:36
mcnets: Why cartoons?

02:05:46
orca2040: That's incredible! Just the one person?

02:05:47
<transcript>: Library of like, we didn't get headshots. We just had someone draw them all white cartoons. It's just kind of like our brand. It's just kind of how we went. So it's a story. Actually, I'm going to come over here and tell you the story.

02:05:53
fragzero_: he update the hair cut, etc?

02:05:54
mattmancodes: he's going to get cramp when you start with the soccer teams

02:06:08
<transcript>: So when eli, My co founder and I, when we started Satmus, we didn't have any illustrations. There was no visual of the player, just like a bunch of numbers. Right? And we knew we wanted to put, like, just the headshots on there. And even an early prototype of Sat. Me's. I probably have old screenshots. I was just ripping the profile photos off of mba.com for every play.

02:06:08
<transcript>: player so we kind of put

02:06:15
<transcript>: Player. So we kind of put it at the top of the search bar. When you ask the question, just like the top result, we put the picture of the person we knew. We.

02:06:15
<transcript>: wanted to have

02:06:22
<transcript>: Wanted to have player illustrations or not illustration. We knew we wanted to have photos of the players in the app.

02:06:22
<transcript>: and every other app

02:06:28
<transcript>: And every other app. You look at every sports app. They all just license the same Getty profile photos where.

02:06:28
<transcript>: the players

02:06:31
<transcript>: The players every year go get their official.

02:06:31
<transcript>: whatever

02:06:35
<transcript>: Whatever bust photo shoulders up.

02:06:55
<transcript>: And like, ESPN has it and bleacher report all of them use the same images. Right. And you can just license them. And we were like talking with I think it was Getty about doing that license. And we didn't really have a lot of cash at the time. It was before we raised our A. So we were like, I don't know. This is kind of an investment. We better be really sure this is going to add to stat, muse.

02:06:55
<transcript>: and

02:06:57
gitpush_gitpaid: wait... did you rip the images or license them because two different things Kappa

02:07:06
<transcript>: And we just kind of decided, like, what if we what if we reached out to some artists and saw if we could just draw because it was just NBA at the time. Could we just draw enough NBA players to make it feel pretty good.

02:07:19
gitpush_gitpaid: brb

02:07:21
<transcript>: And then it's like our own thing. It kind of becomes like your style. And eight years later, I think it paid off. You look at our social media and Status has a very distinctive look. And it's because of those cartoons, really more than anything.

02:07:31
<transcript>: Okay. Throwback to an Albert Pooholes was in the bench warmers. What's the benchwormers is he open to contract work? You can ask him zerk. He does a lot of stuff.

02:07:34
goodgrandpaa: Just a super funny movie!

02:07:39
<transcript>: He doesn't just illustrate. For statins. He does a lot of personal stuff. He's got an Instagram. That's really cool. He's just a cool guy.

02:07:39
<transcript>: let's

02:07:43
<transcript>: Let's see why. Cartoons. That's incredible. Just one person. Yes. Just one person.

02:07:43
<transcript>: he updated

02:07:46
<transcript>: He updated the haircut. Yeah. Let me show you.

02:07:56
<transcript>: Let me show you. Wait. Who's frag? Zero. Frag. Did you change your name? No. There's two frags. So let me show you how he. Let's just look up.

02:07:58
<transcript>: Like Rodman.

02:08:05
fragaverage: wut, another Frag?

02:08:07
<transcript>: Like Dennis rodman famously, has had lots of haircut. We've got a lot of illustrations of rodman, right. All the different hair colors and teams he's played for.

02:08:12
<transcript>: And they'll show up like if you ask a question about.

02:08:12
<transcript>: rodman

02:08:13
cowfacedev: close to 50% to the call LUL

02:08:16
<transcript>: Rodman's rookie season. So let's just go to his rookie season here.

02:08:21
<transcript>: You're going to get this rookie image, right. But if you go to like, you go to his.

02:08:21
<transcript>: later years

02:08:22
midobbexmachina: Any plans about expanding to european soccer?

02:08:23
fragzero_: I older Kappa

02:08:27
<transcript>: Later years, when he played for other teams. Oh, no, you're still going to get okay, awesome. If I ask a question.

02:08:27
<transcript>: if i say like

02:08:31
<transcript>: If I say, like, how many rebounds did.

02:08:31
<transcript>: rod

02:08:33
techsavvytravvy: that's seriously cool

02:08:33
<transcript>: Rodman.

02:08:33
<transcript>: get

02:08:39
<transcript>: Get in his last season. I think it should be aware of. Yeah. So the mavericks. So.

02:08:39
<transcript>: it's going to show

02:08:40
mcnets: How the app makes money?

02:08:46
cosmiclasagna: just got done with scrum meeting, whatd i miss -- did you fix the errors awhile ago?

02:08:54
orca2040: How does it do the natural language parsing?

02:08:55
<transcript>: It's going to show illustrations based on them in that Jersey and how they looked that year. So it's not just thousands of players. He's literally done multiple illustrations for several players. Now, granted, it's easy to swap out the hair color and swap out. But how about this.

02:08:55
<transcript>: so

02:08:57
<transcript>: So Kareem.

02:08:57
<transcript>: look at

02:08:57
techsavvytravvy: y'all's illustrator did some serious work

02:09:04
<transcript>: Look at Kareem, though his are very different, right? So he looked very different young Kareem when he played for the Bucks versus older Lakers. Kareem.

02:09:09
<transcript>: That's a pretty big difference. I mean, he still is just able to swap out hair and stuff.

02:09:09
<transcript>: but anyway

02:09:11
<transcript>: But anyway.

02:09:17
<transcript>: Close to 50% to call it the Call. What.

02:09:17
silverlp: illustrator surely enjoys his job

02:09:18
fragzero_: nice, great work

02:09:21
<transcript>: Wait. Did you rip the images or license them? Because two different things.

02:09:23
<transcript>: No.

02:09:23
<transcript>: the initial

02:09:28
<transcript>: The initial prototype when no one had used thatmes but me and my cofounder Eli.

02:09:28
<transcript>: i had in the prototype

02:09:40
<transcript>: I had in the prototype that I built. I spent like, three months building a prototype. That's where I was ripping the photos. So no one was using it yet. It was just like an idea. Like, does it add to the app? Do we want these here.

02:09:50
<transcript>: Then we start talking to Getty when we were going to launch, to actually officially license the official Player Images. So those are two different things. Yeah. You're right.

02:09:56
<transcript>: Let's see super funny movie what's a super funny movie I missed something.

02:09:57
goodgrandpaa: It's a baseball movie with David Spade, Rob Schneider, and some other big actors, produced by Adam Sandler and Nick Giarraputo.

02:10:02
goodgrandpaa: The Benchwarmers

02:10:03
<transcript>: Any plans about extend to European Soccer? Great question, maido. Yes.

02:10:15
itsmeleague: Is there any way we can see what the prototype looked like? Kinda curious lol

02:10:22
<transcript>: We want to add epl, we want to add IPL, so Cricket as well. We definitely want to add some international sports because I'm aware that American sports are not the only sports. Contrary to popular belief here in the US, there are other sports in the world that might even be more popular than American sports. I know it's hard to imagine.

02:10:22
<transcript>: but

02:10:25
<transcript>: But we do want to add those.

02:10:36
fragzero_: football, not soccer Kappa

02:10:38
<transcript>: It's all just about getting the data. We have to have good data sources. And it's not real time data. There's a million people you can get real time data from. We get ours from Sport Radar. That's easy. Anybody can license the real time data. What's hard is.

02:10:38
<transcript>: comprehensive

02:10:43
<transcript>: Comprehensive historical databases. It's important in status, because if you ask a question like.

02:10:51
<transcript>: Who had the most assists in a game? If you ask this kind of question and.

02:10:51
<transcript>: you don't have

02:10:52
goodgrandpaa: Yep, that's something I want to get ahold of too.

02:10:53
silverlp: data is always the problem

02:10:54
<transcript>: You don't have comprehensive data.

02:11:00
goodgrandpaa: ^^

02:11:07
<transcript>: If your data doesn't go back far enough, or if it's got a lot of holes in it or inaccuracies, these kind of questions are just wrong, but like Scott, scotts does have the record for 30 assists in December of 1990.

02:11:07
<transcript>: those

02:11:17
<transcript>: Those kind of questions with a ui like Satinwes, where it's just ask a question, get an answer. It's very glaring when your data sucks. And we had really bad data early because we were just scraping it.

02:11:17
<transcript>: now like

02:11:17
silverlp: source: i work in fintech and we struggle daily with bank data LUL

02:11:24
<transcript>: Now, like a world renowned statistician, a sports statistician named Justin Gabago, he is the one responsible for our comprehensive historical database.

02:11:28
<transcript>: Okay, I got to stop talking and start building. Let's see.

02:11:32
<transcript>: How does the app make money? Well, that's what I'm doing right now.

02:11:37
<transcript>: We do like quite a bit of revenue off ads. We got video ads on the site now.

02:11:37
<transcript>: it's a deal

02:11:49
ocelot2123: what features will statmuse pro give?

02:11:51
<transcript>: It's a deal. We did it's not like just random video ads. We did a deal with tsn, like the ESPN of Canada, and they pay us pretty well for these ads. We also have a shop, and we do some deals with teams. We did a deal with ESPN once.

02:11:58
<transcript>: We've mostly lived off venture money, and we make some money. We're not far from profitable, actually. We're a very small team.

02:11:58
<transcript>: but

02:12:04
<transcript>: But we're adding a subscription paywall. If you do like over 100 searches in a month, then you have to pay.

02:12:04
<transcript>: and

02:12:13
<transcript>: And that's like, 80,000 people do over 100 searches a month on stat News. Most of that sports, betters journalists, fantasy players, that kind of thing. Okay.

02:12:25
goodgrandpaa: This app is incredible. It's pretty inspirational!

02:12:32
<transcript>: Just got done with Scrum meeting. What did I miss? Fix all the errors we did cosmic. How does it do the natural language pricing? That's a whole nother story. Orca that's what we started with when I built a prototype. It was building out this proprietary natural language stuff. A lot of Stanford nlp. It's dated now eight years later.

02:12:32

02:12:49
smokingears: Hey just finished my standup Too

02:12:55
<transcript>: I've so many times over the years, we've asked, Waltok, are you bored yet? I was always nerdous. Even just like the first few months. It's like still doing it every day. Still having fun. Cool. Okay, cool. But he's the most chill guy ever. And eight years later, I know he's not just lying to us and hating his job. He really enjoys it. That's just what he does. That's all he does.

02:13:05
lesabotsy: Good job though on making money now :)

02:13:06
damko_dev: Good morning Adam

02:13:13
<transcript>: It's not all he does. He's done some other social illustration, illustrations and stuff for us. But for the most part, that's what he does every day. Baseball movie with David Spain, Rob schneider, and some other big Doctors produced by Am sandler and Nick Guriopudo. Oh, the bench warmers. Got it. Is there any way we can look? We can see what the prototype looks like. Yeah.

02:13:46
goodgrandpaa: @techsavvytravvy Everyday :)

02:14:00
<transcript>: Apparently, they're not on my phone right now, but I think I've got them in, like Google Drive or some random place. I'll try to put something together. I know my cofounder keeps tons of stuff. He's got all kinds of, like old relics from the beginning of stat muse.

02:14:03
<transcript>: Football, not soccer.

02:14:05
fragaverage: @FragZero_ no

02:14:07
<transcript>: Okay. I really need to just catch up on chat and get back to work.

02:14:27
<transcript>: Okay. Looks like I'm almost there. Data is always problem. Exactly. I work in Fintech and we struggle with bank data. Yes. What features will samuel's Pro give? So oslot? We're going to make a bunch of new features for doing research. People who use sammy's for their job. We want them to help support us and keep us sustainable and give them more tools to do their research. So better ways to organize their research.

02:14:36
<transcript>: And not just ask random queries over and over and over, but to actually kind of use stat muse as a platform for doing their research.

02:14:47
smokingears: @techsavytravvy  Yup every day for me too

02:14:48
<transcript>: Good grandpa. Thank you so much. Inspirational. That's so nice to hear. I still can't understand how a company that is not profitable attracts vcs. The US is nuts. Lesa, we raised $20 million before we earned a dollar.

02:14:48
<transcript>: but

02:15:03
<transcript>: But largely we raise money from like Disney, Google. It was a last strategic investors. We did raise some vc dollars, but strategics are a little different. They invest in you when they want to buy you. And we were something they wanted. So they invested.

02:15:06
<transcript>: And almost bought but didn't buy us.

02:15:06
warrenbuffering: is Moneyball based on you and Eli?

02:15:10
<transcript>: Vcs are probably a little more hard to impress.

02:15:10
<transcript>: strateg

02:15:16
<transcript>: Strategics. They're like, this would make ESPN better. So we want it. So Disney invested that kind of thing.

02:15:23
<transcript>: Smoking ears. Welcome to Chat. Just finished my stand up. Too. Good job making money. We're going to try and make money. Let's finish this up.

02:15:27

02:15:49
<transcript>: get so

02:15:52
mattmancodes: the scam continues

02:15:56
lesabotsy: I want API access for fantasy stuff, shut up and take my money style.

02:16:01
<transcript>: Get so focused that I don't take time to reflect and call out some interesting facts about that. You might know dax is at the beach right now. That's why he's not here in Chat, that's all.

02:16:05
aj_stuyvenberg: look at that

02:16:10
<transcript>: Okay. Email Adam plus eight at M. One. Net. So this worked. This means our webhook. Let me show you this. Let me show you this.

02:16:12
<transcript>: Webhook.

02:16:12
<transcript>: 's

02:16:26
<transcript>: 's middle event right here. Checkout. Session completed. Handle. Checkout. Session completed. Okay, so right here is what we did. We logged. I don't need to do that. So we do use kaisely. We're using kaisely.

02:16:30
akawr: heya!

02:16:32
techsavvytravvy: i can't tell what's real anymore

02:16:34
<transcript>: And we search for the user based on the client reference ID. So I got the user. That's what we just saw. I got him.

02:16:34
<transcript>: got

02:16:36
<transcript>: Got him.

02:16:36
<transcript>: we only selected

02:16:39
<transcript>: We only selected the email and the ID.

02:16:39
<transcript>: binge

02:16:40
<transcript>: Binge is here.

02:16:40
<transcript>: binge

02:16:42
<transcript>: Binge.

02:16:51
<transcript>: You want api access for fantasy stuff? Shut up and take my money. Yeah. No. We are talking about.

02:16:51
<transcript>: so

02:16:51
akawr: long time :D

02:16:56
akawr: how are things?

02:17:11
<transcript>: So there are thousands of people that do over 1000 queries a month on saturdays. And we think those are probably programmatic queries. We think we've got some cohort of people that use Satmus, like an api. And we just don't officially have an api. So we want to open that up and say, like, here's an api. We just want to understand the use cases. Like, what do people want to do with it? I know people have said they want to.

02:17:11
<transcript>: feed

02:17:23
<transcript>: Feed their fantasy spreadsheets with it. There's things like that. We just want to understand the use cases so we can build the right thing for them, because right now it's all very unofficial. People just use the api, and that's fine. We haven't complained.

02:17:28
<transcript>: Bija things are good how are things for you? It's been so long.

02:17:30
<transcript>: I miss you.

02:17:30

<transcript>: Semi's automated Sports Better. There you go.

02:18:10

02:18:16
<transcript>: When did you decide on Elixir orca so we built the Web portion of Status and elixir.

02:18:16
<transcript>: like the

02:18:26
<transcript>: Like the F sharp. The nlp stuff is F sharp, and we got all kinds of random stuff, but we chose elixir because we had a web Dev who's a really great guy.

02:18:27
akawr: good! yeah, things are good here :D been working on a new product, personalized recommendations. designing the early access marketing site right now.

02:18:39
<transcript>: Who was really into elixir and wanted to use it at his job. And we loved him. We wanted him to work with us. And we said, you can use whatever you want. So he built most of this code base. The electric code base.

02:18:42
<transcript>: Okay. So it was very Engineer led.

02:18:42
<transcript>: matt

02:18:49

02:19:09
<transcript>: Oh, is it a macro? Is that the problem.

02:19:21
<transcript>: Is it just because it was a macro? There we go. Okay. Apparently, if you're recording a macro, which I was accidentally doing, apparently, that kills your lsp. Okay. Or it just doesn't.

02:19:21
<transcript>: let you

02:19:26
<transcript>: Let you interact with it somehow. Db update.

02:19:30

mattmancodes: macros shouldn't do that...

02:19:36

<transcript>: Would you rather have like more time on Friday or something.

02:22:09
fragaverage: "We spent how much on aws in the last 5 minutes"

02:22:16
aj_stuyvenberg: "wait that token I accidentally streamed was for PROD?!"

02:22:20
<transcript>: Yeah, yeah. Let's just have them come because something could happen. And then Friday doesn't work.

greatgrievance: did Adam mean to leave us unmuted?

02:22:29
dinisskizee: "yeah idk about that..."

02:22:35
<transcript>: All right, we're unmuted. You guys couldn't hear me. Stop it.

02:22:39

silverlp: still gotta learn vim still very scared

02:22:43
dinisskizee: Hello Adam :P

02:22:59
<transcript>: It is extensive for us. Usually a good sign when people are riding boss interact through their website. Yeah. Would you hate me if I scraped at me for now? No, go for it, lesa. You're one of many go for it. You're fine. Bingea. Good. Yeah, things are good here. Been working on new product personalized recommendations. Designed the Early Access marketing site now. Nice binge. Make sure and like dm. Me.

02:22:59
<transcript>: d

02:23:03
<transcript>: Dm? Me when you launch it. I want to retweet that stuff.

02:23:09
<transcript>: Lsp restart. Oh, no, we figured that out. I'm behind. Maybe you guys decide to switch from elixir high heel.

02:23:09
<transcript>: that develop

02:23:17
<transcript>: That developer is no longer with us, and it's hard to find people who are good at elixir. So we're rewriting an Astro because we want to build a bunch of new stuff, and we'll move faster.

02:23:22
<transcript>: Macros shouldn't do that. Might be an issue with my nvim.

02:23:22
<transcript>: oh my days

02:23:26
lazic88: You can have RDS for $18 at lowest

02:23:38
cosmiclasagna: ever have any discussions for adding maybe esports stats? just curious

02:23:39
<transcript>: Oh, my days. What is this? Camera? Magic. Oh, bingea, you don't even know you've been gone a while. I do things. I do things when time passes. Arrow keys. Yeah, sorry, I'm not the best dimmer headphone ipads. Let's go.

02:23:41
<transcript>: Okay, you guys with your trolling.

02:23:41

02:23:45
<transcript>: You're trolling. You're guessing what I was talking about. It's all funny.

02:23:55
<transcript>: We spent. What's that say? We spent how much on aws, the last ten minutes. Okay, you guys are funny. We've got to get to the car now we're going to make it to the city by dinner time.

02:23:59
<transcript>: Did Adam mean to leave us unmuted? That was a good troll. Great.

02:23:59
<transcript>: good tr

02:24:03
<transcript>: Good troll. If I wasn't muted. Tell me what we said.

02:24:08
lazic88: But all other cloud providers are similar. Digitalocean and Heroku are around $15

02:24:08
kronborg6: !nvim

02:24:08
fossabot: Adam uses the Dracula theme with the Operator Mono font in Neovim.

02:24:10
greatgrievance: that's why i ultimately moved back to TS from Elixir. A large percentage of Elixir devs are very passionate about Elixir, but they're still a small minority of enigneers.

02:24:10
<transcript>: Don't be scared, Silver. Don't be scared of them. It's so worth learning. I promise you. Hello, Denny.

02:24:11
anmol99tv: !config

02:24:15

02:24:16

02:24:16
<transcript>: esp

02:24:17

02:24:17

warrenbuffering: you were fighting over solar panels

02:24:21
<transcript>: Funny cosmic you should ask we early on hired someone.

02:24:21
<transcript>: an esp

02:24:30
<transcript>: An Esports expert to build us an Esports database. We're going to do League of Legends and dota. And after a few months, we learned.

02:24:30
<transcript>: that

02:24:31
<transcript>: That.

02:24:31
<transcript>: this expert

02:24:34

02:24:44
cosmiclasagna: LUL

02:24:46
fragzero_: cs

02:24:47
<transcript>: This expert we hired was just addicted to games, and he didn't do a single thing. He didn't build anything for us. So we had to fire him. So the dream died. We were going to do esports. We were. We might still revisit. We'll see all other cloud writers are similar digitalocean heroku around $15.

02:24:47

02:25:11

02:25:11
anmol99tv: yesyes

02:25:16

02:25:30

orca2040: Do you have a picture of your set up?

02:25:34
<transcript>: We're onto something. Now we got the customer.

02:25:35
anmol99tv: you are very kind

02:25:38
<transcript>: Stripe Subscription status equals session.

02:25:40
<transcript>: Status.

02:25:44

02:25:50
<transcript>: Here, we here, we go now.

02:25:50
<transcript>: session

02:25:55
<transcript>: Session status. Complete. That's not what I'm looking for. Payment status. Paid.

02:25:57
orca2040: I guess I can kind of see it in the pan :P

02:25:58
<transcript>: I feel like I'm looking for something like active.

02:26:01
<transcript>: What am I looking for.

02:26:02
tumtumpkinz: What was the thought behind going with Astro?

02:26:06
<transcript>: Complete. Is it complete? No. That would be like.

02:26:08
ocelot2123: esports stats suck right now and it really seems like not much progress has been made. But I think a real problem is not having "pace" or like "possessions" in traditional sports sense so its hard to normalize stats for advanced stats.

02:26:11
<transcript>: The what is that? Is that the session is complete. Is that what it's saying.

02:26:13
dinisskizee: @Orca2040 crazy ass setup

02:26:14
mattmancodes: @anmol99tv don't be fooled. Dax will tell you about the real Adam

02:26:15
<transcript>: How do I know that they paid.

02:26:15
<transcript>: i guess i could

02:26:16
romejeee: hello :) im new to software engineering

02:26:17
<transcript>: I guess I could look at the docs.

02:26:18
devtechnica: is this stuff actually open source? or are you just sharing the code on stream?

02:26:20
<transcript>: Let's look at the docs.

02:26:25
<transcript>: What they do in fulfill order here. They don't do anything. They just leave that to you.

02:26:32
itsmeleague: League might be decently easy to get data for, riot has a bunch of APIs

02:26:36
<transcript>: So do they say something here. Now you have basically.

02:26:36
dinisskizee: @ocelot2123 how would someone go about getting data like that of something? Is it a long talk ahahah

02:26:37
devtechnica: just ask them nicely and they'll tell you if they paid

02:26:50
<transcript>: Customer and their payment. You might also consider saving a copy of the order in your own database. Sending the customer a receipt, email, reconciling the line, items and quantity purchased by the customer. If using adjustable quantity, add code to your event handler to fulfill the order.

02:26:56
<transcript>: Ensure that it's a stripe. Listen. Okay. So.

02:27:00
<transcript>: Anybody who does stripe a lot. It's been a while. Can someone tell me.

02:27:20
<transcript>: Can someone tell me, do you have a picture of your setup. Orga? A picture of my setup. You can kind of see it. Yeah, I've got a lot of pictures, actually, I've put them on Twitter. If you're on Twitter orca what was the thought behind going with astro? Just love it. It's kind of like the perfect use case for sap meos. That means there's just millions of pages.

02:27:20
<transcript>: we do something

02:27:28
<transcript>: We do something like a million new inbounds from Google every day. So people hit Google searching results and end up on stap music like a million times a day.

02:27:42
<transcript>: It's kind of perfect for astro. It's not perfect for a React app, which is what our it's an elixir back end with a React app embedded in it, half of its server rendered half of its client. There's no rhyme or reason as to why we did that, I don't think.

02:27:44
akawr: nextjs ships so much unnecessary js

02:27:51
<transcript>: But it's not ideal. We have to do all this pre render stuff for Google. It's just kind of bad. So astro is just like write some typescript to grab the data and render the page.

02:27:51
<transcript>: it's super

02:27:54
akawr: astro is content-focused and great

02:27:57
<transcript>: It's super simple. We'll do some kind of exotic caching strategies, but it's going to be pretty great.

02:28:00
<transcript>: Yeah, so much unnecessary. Js. It.

02:28:00
<transcript>: 's not

02:28:07
fragzero_: are you using docker and kubernetes ?

02:28:09
<transcript>: 's not a very interactive site. Status is pretty uninteractive. It's just a bunch of pages. It's like wikipedia. So given the choice between react.

02:28:09
<transcript>: and ast

02:28:13
<transcript>: And astro. I know those aren't apples to apples, but.

02:28:13
<transcript>: you'd

02:28:22
<transcript>: You'd build wikipedia in astro, right? It's like php. We could have just built sat me's and php. And if I knew php probably would have.

02:28:22
<transcript>: using

02:28:27
<transcript>: Using Docker and Kubernetes no frag. We are not using either of those things.

02:28:28
greatgrievance: Laravel would've been a great choice

02:28:34
<transcript>: You guys talk about Esports. Dax will tell you about the real Adam. Don't tell them.

02:28:37
laytanl_: Last time I did stripe, I had webhooks listening for status updates of the order

02:28:40
<transcript>: New to software engineering? Welcome Rome. New to software.

02:28:40
<transcript>: this stuff actually

02:28:40
goodgrandpaa: Does Statmuse have api?

02:28:44
greatgrievance: working on one

02:28:46
ocelot2123: @ocelot2123 theres people working on stats for specific games like https://oracleselixir.com/ but its just not as useful as traditional sports stats imo. Its hard to normalize and contextualize the data as there are just too many factors per game I think

02:28:50
<transcript>: This stuff actually open source. Are you just sharing the code on stream? So Dev technical we're going to open source the new front end, the astro site. I just haven't even pushed it to get yet to GitHub.

02:28:55
<transcript>: I've been working on this rewrite for months, and I just haven't pushed to GitHub yet, but I will.

02:28:55
<transcript>: the league

02:29:07
<transcript>: The League might be decently, easy to get data for right. As a bunch of apis. Yeah. I think we had interacted with the apis. I think we were looking at the real time picture, and it was like we need somebody to collect the historical data. And this person did not do that.

02:29:10
grasp5533: Hey Adam, excited to see how to use stripe.

02:29:12
akawr: how many work at statmuse with you?

02:29:13
<transcript>: How would someone go about getting data like that or something? That's a long what did it say.

02:29:16
<transcript>: Is it a long talk.

02:29:16
<transcript>: getting data

02:29:20
<transcript>: Getting data? Oh, esports. Yeah, I don't actually know.

02:29:34
<transcript>: Are you using? Okay. Laravo would have been a great choice. Yeah, it probably would have. Honestly. Last time I did stripe, I had webhooks like, I'm sure a good layer of all Dev could have rewritten sat me is faster than I can ride it in astro, but that's fine.

02:29:34
<transcript>: ricky

02:29:37
<transcript>: Ricky bgs. Thank you for the follow.

02:29:39
orca2040: Found a picture of the setup from yesterdayish :)

02:29:46
<transcript>: Last time you had the stripe, you had webhooks listing for status updates of the order. Yeah. Maybe it's the checkout session update, not what I want.

02:29:46
<transcript>: good

02:29:52
ayushsharma: what are web hooks ?

02:29:54
<transcript>: Good grandpa Stamp Use does not have an api yet. Well, not a public one, not an official api. We've talked about putting that out there, though.

02:29:54
<transcript>: oh

02:30:02
greatgrievance: The Laravel ecosystem is flush with convenience and shortcuts

02:30:04
goodgrandpaa: Gotcha! would be cool, extra income :)

02:30:04
<transcript>: Oh, grievance just answered. You okay? I got to just stop reading and start working. It's just like I'm procrastinating excited to see how you stripe. Hey, Grass, I'm excited too. How are you doing.

02:30:11
<transcript>: Binge, how many people work at me? We're about ten people right now. At our peak, we were like, 25.

02:30:14
silverlp: are you copying over styles and stuff from the old page or is it more like a rework

02:30:31
<transcript>: What are webhooks webhooks are like? You need to receive events from some outside party. In this case, I need stripe to tell me when things happen. So we send somebody to the stripe page to pay for status. And then when they pay, I need an event that gives me all the details. So you set up a webhook, which is just like an API.

02:30:31
<transcript>: and

02:30:36
warrenbuffering: basically callbacks

02:30:39
devtechnica: @ayushsharma webhooks are apis you expose on your application that third party apps that you use can send you information

02:30:41
<transcript>: And you register like an endpoint. You say I want you stripe to hit this place with a payload of data when you have events to share, that's what a web hook is.

02:30:42
ocelot2123: @adamdotdev I'm bad at elixir, hire me Kappa

02:30:46
<transcript>: Larryville ecosystem is flush with convenience and shortcuts. Yeah, that sounds nice right now.

02:30:46
<transcript>: okay

02:30:49
<transcript>: Okay. I really got to get to it.

02:30:52
<transcript>: I guess I'm almost done streaming.

02:30:54
itsmeleague: Would you still be interested in esports data? Sorry for distracting you so much lol

02:30:54
<transcript>: Badded elixir hire me.

02:30:57
<transcript>: That's funny.

02:31:02
<transcript>: Basically callbacks. Yeah. Are you copying over styles and stuff from the old page? Yeah. No.

02:31:14
<transcript>: It's little minor reworking. There's little things that we're fixing as I go along, and I'm going to add Dark mode, like little features like that. But for the most part, it's just copying over the existing site into Astro.

02:31:24
<transcript>: Would you still be interested in Esports data? Sorry for tracking you. No, it's me, League. I would be a whisperer. Me if you know how to get that.

02:31:24
<transcript>: that doesn't involve

02:31:27
<transcript>: That doesn't involve just playing games all day.

02:31:27
<transcript>: okay

02:31:27
m2devdotnet: Dark mode = "little feature" MaxLOL

02:31:28
<transcript>: Okay.

02:31:30
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:31:42
<transcript>: I need to figure out how do I want to say I know that they paid. So we have this data. This is the checkout session. This object is. Thank you for the follows. Roam G an agent.

02:31:46
anmol99tv: hey adam what plugin are you using for tabs in neovim

02:31:47
<transcript>: So we see we have a completed.

02:31:47
<transcript>: status

02:31:49
<transcript>: Status down here somewhere.

02:31:54
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow.

02:31:54
<transcript>: and

02:31:55
<transcript>: And mall.

02:31:59
<transcript>: Paid payment status. Paid.

02:32:01
sockthedev: Dota is such a killer timesuck

02:32:01
mattmancodes: @anmol99tv that's tmux

02:32:04
<transcript>: And status. Complete.

02:32:04
<transcript>: we have

02:32:06
silverlp: darkmode? here you go html { filter: invert(1); }

02:32:06
<transcript>: We have a subscription. Id.

02:32:11
<transcript>: I guess I could go get the subscription.

02:32:16
<transcript>: And that might have, like, a subscription status. That might be what I want.

02:32:20
<transcript>: Here's what I'm going to do.

02:32:20
<transcript>: i'm going to

02:32:22
anmol99tv: @mattmancodes i meant buffers

02:32:23
<transcript>: I'm going to go to my last known.

02:32:27
<transcript>: Stripe to implementation.

02:32:31
<transcript>: We're going to go in here. Subscription.

02:32:33
<transcript>: No.

02:32:33
<transcript>: it's going to be

02:32:35
<transcript>: It's going to be webhooks or something.

02:32:35
<transcript>: let's just

02:32:38
<transcript>: Let's just do this stripe.

02:32:41
<transcript>: Stripe.

02:32:47
<transcript>: Use stripe.

02:32:50
<transcript>: I'm looking for some webhooks.

02:32:53
<transcript>: Create environment.

02:32:58
<transcript>: Well.

02:33:03
<transcript>: Load stripe. Oh, is this it? No, that's the front end.

02:33:03
coolpantstv: @adamdotdev the first one

02:33:05
mattmancodes: @anmol99tv it's still tmux if talking about at the top of the terminal.

02:33:09
<transcript>: Where are the Web hooks? Oh, stripe. Webcoat. It's right here.

02:33:09
<transcript>: literally right in front of

02:33:11
<transcript>: Literally right in front of my face. It was the first result.

02:33:19
<transcript>: Okay. So invoice payment succeeded. Oh, I was listening to different events, wasn't I.

02:33:23
<transcript>: Customer subscription created.

02:33:26
<transcript>: Updated? Deleted.

02:33:29
anmol99tv: @mattmancodes oh thank you i thought it was plugin

02:33:30
<transcript>: Payment method attached. What am I doing with all these.

02:33:33
<transcript>: Payment methods.

02:33:37
<transcript>: Am I storing a payment method.

02:33:37
<transcript>: why

02:33:39
<transcript>: Why was I doing this.

02:33:44
<transcript>: I wasn't using checkout. I was using elements on this one.

02:33:46
romejeee: can I ask what nvim package you use to display function signature at the top of your vim editor?

02:33:48
<transcript>: The first one turns out.

02:33:51
<transcript>: Filter invert one.

02:33:53
<transcript>: That's funny.

02:34:04
<transcript>: Can I ask what invim package you use to display function signature at the top. It's context. It's like tree sitter, context.

02:34:07
<transcript>: That right there.

02:34:07
<transcript>: yeah

02:34:16
romejeee: thanks :)

02:34:17
<transcript>: Yeah. Look up, tree sitter context. Okay. So I don't know if that status is what I want to set that to. I don't think it is. I think I want to fetch the subscription.

02:34:17
<transcript>: let's see

02:34:19
<transcript>: Let's see, status.

02:34:19
<transcript>: inv

02:34:21
<transcript>: Invoice paid.

02:34:24
aj_stuyvenberg: another great tune

02:34:25
<transcript>: Here we go. Update subscription.

02:34:30
mattmancodes: @anmol99tv no worries. I use cokeline for that kind of thing though, maybe check that out.

02:34:34
<transcript>: So on subscription, created or updated or deleted, we just update the subscription.

02:34:43
<transcript>: And then we remove current subscription ID. Okay. So I could do that. I could just listen to those events.

02:34:48
<transcript>: Instead of the session.

02:34:48
<transcript>: event

02:35:05
<transcript>: Events. Does that sound bad? I mean, the docs, tell me the docs, tell me to do what I'm doing. But I feel like these are the customer subscription created, update and deleted. These are the events that are really that's the money makers right there. Right. I don't need to worry about the payment methods because I'm not using elements I'm using. Checkout.

02:35:07
<transcript>: Okay.

02:35:11
<transcript>: I feel like, what are we doing up here.

02:35:11
<transcript>: subscription

02:35:20
<transcript>: Subscription Create Payment intent. Set the default payment method. Okay, I don't need to worry about all that I'm using checkout. I think these events, though. These do matter.

02:35:23
<transcript>: I think these do matter.

02:35:25
<transcript>: Go back here.

02:35:29
<transcript>: Handle event. Let's just paste these down here.

02:35:39
<transcript>: So customer subscription created or updated and then deleted.

02:35:43
<transcript>: We don't need to do this.

02:35:46
<transcript>: Just need to do event.

02:35:57
<transcript>: Okay. And then you actually create it. Let's do this async function, handle.

02:35:59
<transcript>: Yes.

02:36:02
<transcript>: Vent stripe discriminated event.

02:36:05
<transcript>: What was it.

02:36:08
<transcript>: No. Not session completed. No.

02:36:10
<transcript>: Subscription.

02:36:17
<transcript>: So this is going to be.

02:36:19
<transcript>: Subscription.

02:36:20
mattmancodes: @anmol99tv https://github.com/willothy/nvim-cokeline

02:36:23
<transcript>: Customer subscription event. That was it.

02:36:27
<transcript>: Customer subscription event. Yeah.

02:36:35
<transcript>: Console, log.

02:36:44
<transcript>: Json. String Five. Yeah. Okay. So here's what we're going to do.

02:36:48
anmol99tv: @mattmancodes sure, I will try it. Currently I am using barbar but it's not showing buffers as tabs

02:36:50
<transcript>: We're going to subscribe to those events and I'm going to see if I can get everything I need from those and just ignore all this stuff.

02:36:59
<transcript>: To ignore the checkout session completed if I think I can get what I need from Subscription creator updated, okay.

02:36:59
<transcript>: cool

02:37:01
<transcript>: Cool.

02:37:06
<transcript>: Let's do I got to update the webhook.

02:37:08
<transcript>: It's almost Tan, isn't it.

02:37:08
<transcript>: almost

02:37:10
<transcript>: Almost ten.

02:37:19
<transcript>: See web hooks. This is my webhook. I'm going to update the details.

02:37:23
<transcript>: I'm going to select new events. I'm going to do subscription.

02:37:27
<transcript>: Created, deleted.

02:37:32
<transcript>: Pinning update resumed.

02:37:36
treflxyz: When Vercel?

02:37:36
<transcript>: I think I just want all the customer ones.

02:37:38
<transcript>: Oh, no, I don't.

02:37:38
<transcript>: no

02:37:40
<transcript>: No, too many.

02:37:50
<transcript>: Session Tax ID don't care, don't care, don't care Subscription Updated trial will end there's no trial.

02:37:54
<transcript>: Resumed pending update. Applied.

02:37:54
<transcript>: i don't know what

02:38:04
<transcript>: I don't know what those are. I'm going to just get rid of them. Created. Deleted. Oh, customer source. What are these? Discounts? Oh, boy. So, no.

02:38:05
l_mbert: Hello everyone!

02:38:07
treflxyz: When you go to Vercel :D because every tech famous person go

02:38:13
<transcript>: Just created. Deleted pause, resumed. Updated sounds good. And then we have.

02:38:13
<transcript>: these session event

02:38:16
<transcript>: These session events as well. Okay.

02:38:18
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:38:18
<transcript>: another

02:38:24
<transcript>: Another great tune. Oh, thanks, aj. I love this song. I love all the songs on this playlist.

02:38:39
<transcript>: Win versaille Hello, everyone, when you go to Versailles because every tech famous person go, I don't think roselle is going to be reaching out to me anytime soon. I've been pretty publicly critical of some Versailles.

02:38:39
<transcript>: in both

02:38:51
<transcript>: In both a trolley kind of way and in an actually critical kind of way. Like the trolley kind of way. I'm like, I don't know. It just takes himself so seriously as a brand. And it's like, front end hosting. I don't know.

02:38:58
<transcript>: They don't make amazing hardware like Apple. So that part is easy to poke fun at. Okay, let's just do this.

02:39:01
<transcript>: I'm going to subscribe again.

02:39:03
<transcript>: Off.

02:39:03
<transcript>: sign

02:39:05
<transcript>: Sign out.

02:39:09
<transcript>: And then we're going to go pro.

02:39:09
<transcript>: now we're going to

02:39:11
<transcript>: Now we're going to say, atom.

02:39:11
<transcript>: plus

02:39:11
l_mbert: Got the Redirects working? :D

02:39:13
<transcript>: Plus test.

02:39:14
cenl: Versel seems like a fad more then anything else, and AWS I am sure will replace them with a cheaper feature at somepoint on aws

02:39:15
<transcript>: Nine.

02:39:15
<transcript>: atmore

02:39:20
<transcript>: Atmore Dev let's see what kind of webhooks we get here.

02:39:20
<transcript>: got the

02:39:26
cenl: see redis, elastic, etc

02:39:30
<transcript>: Got the redirects working. Yeah, we do, lambert. We got it all working. It's a little slow. That was a little slow, but it's all in dev, so it's probably really slow. We'll test it. Staging.

02:39:33
<transcript>: Adam Elmore.

02:39:36
<transcript>: Cool.

02:39:38
<transcript>: Subscribe.

02:39:43
treflxyz: I'm from Poland, you have NBA stats website. What do you think about Jeremy Sochan from SAS?

02:39:43
<transcript>: Get out of here. Hello? Lambert.

02:39:51
aj_stuyvenberg: oh no adam you're still on lastpass

02:39:51
<transcript>: Sinnell. Welcome to Chat versailles. Seems like a fad more than anything else in aws. I'm sure will replace them with a cheaper feature at some point on ABS.

02:39:55
<transcript>: So I don't know.

02:39:55
<transcript>: aws

02:40:03
<transcript>: Aws is already I'm on the last pass. Oh, yeah, I'm still on lastpass. People make fun of me all the time. I don't know. Is that a security vulnerability? So to answer.

02:40:03
<transcript>: your to

02:40:11
aj_stuyvenberg: lol yes it is

02:40:18
l_mbert: LastPass got all their Vaults leaked lol

02:40:23
<transcript>: Your to respond to your comments. Cinell aws already does things that Versaille does. It's just the reason people use versailles. It's easy. You can just add your github repo and it's easy. The reason people don't use things like amplify, which has similar features, is rosell. Host your next js site. Connect your github repo because aws has a lot of baggage. It's like just creating an aws account is like a hurdle.

02:40:23
<transcript>: or it's

02:40:29
<transcript>: Or it's easy to sign up for versailles with github and you're on your way. So it's not so much that.

02:40:29
<transcript>: the aw

02:40:31
sockthedev: amplify 🤮

02:40:33
l_mbert: Encrypted, but still

02:40:35
<transcript>: The aws will add features to disrupt versailles. Versailles only competing against themselves. It's just.

02:40:35
<transcript>: do

02:40:36
sockthedev: you are lucky dax isn't here

02:40:36
greatgrievance: Digital Ocean is the sweet spot, imo

02:40:40
itsmeleague: Yep need credit card for aws

02:40:46
sockthedev: SST

02:40:50
<transcript>: Do they have a good business model? I don't know. Is front end hosting a thing that people will pay for enough. So to justify their 300 million dollar raise and whatever their valuation was, versaille is not in trouble in terms of competition. They've got a great product. I use it for a lot of stuff.

02:40:59
l_mbert: @ItsMeLeague also for Vercel no?

02:41:02
silverlp: @GreatGrievance hell no DO is such a mid VPS provider imo

02:41:10
<transcript>: It's just kind of like a low value area that they stand out in front end hosting. Maybe they'll expand and they'll do other things. I'm happy to play Planet scale copious amounts of money because it takes off databases from my plate. And I'm used to spending a lot on databases. Front end hosting is not a thing I'm used to spending a lot on. I'm not used to spending.

02:41:10
<transcript>: anything on

02:41:17
<transcript>: Anything on it. So that's my concern for versailles is they've raised $300 million. They've hired all the greatest minds in Web Dev.

02:41:17
<transcript>: and

02:41:25
greatgrievance: @GreatGrievance I don't want a VPS. I want an App platform and fully managed databases without a headache.

02:41:31
treflxyz: I think vercel buy Supabase or PlanetScale

02:41:34
<transcript>: And they do front end hosting. I don't know. I hope it works out, but I don't think aws will disrupt them. If they were going to do it, they would have the problem with aws is they don't make good vertical developer experiences. We're done it, did it, we did it. Look, we did it. Here's, all the events.

02:41:34
<transcript>: so then

02:41:37
itsmeleague: @l_mbert oh I thought you didnt have to at first

02:41:39
greatgrievance: @GreatGrievance or fully managed kubernetes

02:41:40
<transcript>: So then let's look at the events. This is awful looking. Let's go over here and look at the events right here.

02:41:51
<transcript>: I'm from Poland. You have NBA Stats Website. What do you think about Jeremy? So.

02:41:51
<transcript>: from the

02:41:55
<transcript>: From the spurs. I don't follow the NBA much anymore.

02:41:55
<transcript>: tref

02:41:57
l_mbert: @ItsMeLeague Yeah, true, they have a Hobby Plan

02:42:03
<transcript>: Tref. I used to be very into the mba, I think sat me's kind of burnt me out. Honestly, we have some really cool sports moments in our satinwe sounding history.

02:42:05
<transcript>: But.

02:42:12
<transcript>: In six years just engross in sports in the sports industry and it gets a little like less enthralling.

02:42:17
silverlp: never seen anyone talk about digital ocean "app"

02:42:23
<transcript>: They got all their vaults leaked. Are you kidding me? Amplify? Ew Lucky dax isn't here because I just talked about amplifying digitalocean is the sweet spot.

02:42:34
<transcript>: Need credit card or for aws. Yeah, that's true. Also, you might need one for versailles. I don't know. I think they have a free tier that you don't need a credit card for. Maybe. I don't know.

02:42:44
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm just not big into doing running virtual machines, so I don't really care for any of the cloud providers that don't offer higher level, primitives, higher level like managed services.

02:42:48
l_mbert: PlanetScale is great, just not so much if you have a lot of Data and not a lot of Money :D

02:42:56
greatgrievance: That's what Digital Ocean is today

02:43:01
<transcript>: I want an app platform. It's fully managed database without headache. That's right. Great. Grievance. That's what I want. I think versailles buy superbase or Plant Scale. You think so? I don't know if I can afford Planet Scale. I don't know anything about superbases financials, but I don't think they could afford Planet Skill. I thought you didn't. Maybe plan Skill will acquire verse.

02:43:06
<transcript>: I thought you didn't have to at first.

02:43:13
sockthedev: Planetscale is amazing

02:43:15
<transcript>: True they have a hobby plan. Never seen anyone talk about digitalocean app plan scale is great, just not so much if you have a lot of data and not a lot of money.

02:43:25
<transcript>: Okay. What am I doing? I'm looking at these. So check out session completed, and then we got customer subscription created right here.

02:43:27
sockthedev: whats "a lot of dat" @l_mbert ?

02:43:31
<transcript>: And it's going to have, like, a status. This is a subscription object. Yeah.

02:43:38
<transcript>: So here we got items, subscription item. I don't care. I've only have one product right now.

02:43:38
<transcript>: but i'm looking

02:43:41
<transcript>: But I'm looking for status.

02:43:41
<transcript>: there's plan

02:43:44
<transcript>: There's plan? Don't care status incomplete. Okay.

02:43:47
l_mbert: @sockthedev I have 1 Billion Rows

02:43:49
<transcript>: But do I have like a customer ID on here.

02:43:54
silverlp: i mean vercel is announcing a lot of things soon. im assuming they acquired some things. or partnerships maybe

02:43:56
<transcript>: I have a customer ID. No. Yeah, there it is. Customer ID.

02:43:56
<transcript>: and then

02:43:57
<transcript>: And then.

02:44:07
<transcript>: I need the subscription status, so yeah, I've got the two things I need. It's just this one happens to be incomplete. Now, if we go to updated, it's probably going to say.

02:44:12
<transcript>: Status active. There it is.

02:44:20
<transcript>: All right, here we go. Getting ready to tie it all together? It's getting ready to all come together, everybody.

02:44:20
<transcript>: it's all coming

02:44:22
<transcript>: It's all coming together now.

02:44:25
<transcript>: It's all coming together.

02:44:25
<transcript>: okay

02:44:29
<transcript>: Okay. If I were just better at them, it would have probably already been done.

02:44:30
<transcript>: So event.

02:44:33
<transcript>: Event.

02:44:33
<transcript>: customer

02:44:36
<transcript>: Customer and then event.

02:44:42
<transcript>: Subscription.

02:44:45
<transcript>: Object.

02:44:57
<transcript>: What object? Dot.

02:45:00
<transcript>: Oh, object is a string.

02:45:00
<transcript>: what

02:45:01
<transcript>: What.

02:45:05
<transcript>: What is this, though.

02:45:08
<transcript>: Data.

02:45:11
<transcript>: Do I have to do data.

02:45:15
<transcript>: Then Dot data.

02:45:18
<transcript>: Object.

02:45:20
<transcript>: Status. There we go.

02:45:25
<transcript>: Now what I do earlier session? What was I doing up here.

02:45:25
<transcript>: session

02:45:29
<transcript>: Session. Oh. Event data object. Okay. So let's do that. Let's just do this.

02:45:29
<transcript>: comp

02:45:31
<transcript>: Comp. Subscription. Yeah.

02:45:37
<transcript>: Let's do this.

02:45:40
<transcript>: Subscription.

02:45:48
<transcript>: Customer as string. And then let's just stripe subscription status. Subscription status. Done.

02:45:54
<transcript>: Way does no effect on this type of stretching. Why is that not? Oh, because I haven't actually done the.

02:45:56
<transcript>: Where.

02:45:59
<transcript>: Users ID.

02:46:01
<transcript>: Yes. Now we're talking.

02:46:06
<transcript>: Except client reference idea is not available. Awesome.

02:46:08
<transcript>: Oh no.

02:46:12
<transcript>: Not like this. Not like this.

02:46:12
<transcript>: client

<transcript>: Client round. No.

02:46:19
<transcript>: We were so close.

02:46:22
cosmiclasagna: F

02:46:27
cosmiclasagna: KEKW

02:46:30
<transcript>: Do I need to put the customer ID. I need to put the customer ID on the but what if these happened? They happen at the exact same second. Look at that.

02:46:40
<transcript>: What a bummer.

02:46:46
<transcript>: I need the client reference ID. I don't have the customer associated yet.

02:46:49
gitpush_gitpaid: i have to brb again. standup no one talk so i dont miss anything until im back. thanks.

02:46:49
<transcript>: So I could look up the customer.

02:46:56
<transcript>: If I expand the customer, do I have the client reference ID? Then.

02:46:59
<transcript>: If I expand the customer.

02:46:59
<transcript>: let

02:47:00
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:47:07
<transcript>: I bet if I do that.

02:47:07
<transcript>: if i

02:47:12
<transcript>: If I fetch the customer. Okay. So, like, up here. Undo, undo, undo.

<transcript>: Okay.

02:47:57
<transcript>: I actually have to cast that.

02:48:04

02:48:07
<transcript>: I don't know if I need to expand anything. I should get the customer.

02:48:13
<transcript>: And that's a type what strike customer or deleted customer.

02:48:19
<transcript>: Object.

02:48:20
silverlp: satisfies string Kappa

02:48:23
<transcript>: Is that just a string.

02:48:31
<transcript>: Object wait.

02:48:38
<transcript>: Object. Straight. Representing the customer's type. Object says it's what.

02:48:43
<transcript>: I think I can say.

02:48:43
<transcript>: customer

02:48:45
<transcript>: Customer is of type.

02:48:53

<transcript>: Retrieve.

02:49:28
<transcript>: Customers by email.

02:49:34
<transcript>: What I need to know is what I can do with a customer after I get it.

02:49:40
<transcript>: I could expand the customer.

02:49:40
<transcript>: and

02:49:41
<transcript>: And.

02:49:45
<transcript>: See a turk. We'll see in a bit. If I'm still here, I might not be.

<transcript>: Let's see, stripe.

02:50:20
overra_dev: howdy adam, missed your last few streams. hope you're well

02:50:21
<transcript>: Customer. Here we go.

02:50:24
techsavvytravvy: the production on your channel is too good @adamdotdev

02:50:31
<transcript>: So this is what it returns. Object is literally the word customer. Okay, that's not what I need. I need all this stuff.

02:50:34
<transcript>: What do I need, specifically.

02:50:39
<transcript>: I need the client reference ID.

02:50:39
<transcript>: is that only

02:50:42
<transcript>: Is that only on the checkout session.

02:50:42
<transcript>: it's only

02:50:45
overra_dev: ^

02:50:46
<transcript>: It's only on the checkout session. The client reference ID.

02:50:46
<transcript>: only

02:50:49
silverlp: just kidding i wish i could just TS satisfies but we havent updated our TS yet SwiftRage

<transcript>: Or should I just listen.

02:51:00
<transcript>: to the checkout

02:51:05
<transcript>: To the checkout session completed. Should I listen to that event and then fetch.

02:51:10
<transcript>: The Should I fetch a subscription at that point.

02:51:16
<transcript>: Yeah. Maybe.

02:51:24
<transcript>: Okay. What if I expand? Let's just see what's on the.

<transcript>: What's on it? Check out session completed.

02:51:30

02:52:23
<transcript>: Do I need to make it worse.

02:52:23
<transcript>: am i

02:52:25
itsmeleague: @techsavvytravvy he made a bunch of his stuff live in his early streams, like the scene switcher and stuff

02:52:35
<transcript>: Am I saying the standard too high? And then my silly face comes on and it's like this isn't matched. Doesn't match the production quality. Howdy o, vera, Miss Joshua streams hope I'm Well, I'm good. How are you? Ovara.

02:52:39
<transcript>: I did make it all live? Yeah.

02:52:39
<transcript>: a scene switcher

02:52:47
overra_dev: good! thank you

02:52:51
schrew: just wait a bit, it won't look "too good" anymore when adam tries to do confetti or tries a new transition

02:52:51
<transcript>: A Scene switcher. I did all the overlay stuff with david's Help early in my streaming career. Session with Subscription await. Check out sessions, retrieve expand subscription. So now session with subscription.

02:52:58
<transcript>: Object.

02:52:58
techsavvytravvy: i'm just jealous

02:53:00
<transcript>: Is not what I want.

02:53:00
<transcript>: it's

02:53:04
<transcript>: It's a client reference ID. There it is.

02:53:04
<transcript>: okay

02:53:07
<transcript>: Okay. So from here.

02:53:11
<transcript>: Oh, no, that's not what I need. I need the status.

02:53:14
<transcript>: Yes.

02:53:14
itsmeleague: Just rip it off his github Kappa

02:53:18
<transcript>: Status.

02:53:18
<transcript>: and then i have

02:53:22
<transcript>: And then I have the customer ID. So here's what we're going to do. Here's what we're going to do.

02:53:27
<transcript>: Update Table We're going to go ahead and update the customer.

02:53:31
<transcript>: I don't understand oh, because I haven't done.

02:53:31
<transcript>: where

02:53:33
<transcript>: Where.

02:53:36
<transcript>: Session Client Reference ID.

02:53:43
<transcript>: Execute. I think it should be execute. Take first. Is that what it was.

02:53:43
<transcript>: execute

02:53:45
<transcript>: Execute. Take first.

02:53:46
grasp5533: Are you using SQL instead of Dynamo?

02:53:50
<transcript>: Let's delete all this.

02:53:58
gitpush_gitpaid: @techsavvytravvy dont be. your zoom in redemption >>>> adams fancy transitions

02:54:00
<transcript>: So where Users ID equals Client reference ID. That's correct. So we set the customer and we set.

02:54:02
<transcript>: The subscription.

02:54:08
<transcript>: Status? I'm sorry. Session with subscription.

02:54:10
<transcript>: With subscription.

02:54:15
<transcript>: Okay. So that's the initial updating of it.

02:54:15
<transcript>: and then

02:54:16
<transcript>: And then.

02:54:26
<transcript>: Down here we're going to listen to these events as well. And we're going to say we don't need to get the customer anymore. We just need to do subscription, update users.

02:54:30
<transcript>: We don't need to set the customer ID. We just need to set the status.

02:54:32
<transcript>: To that where.

02:54:32
<transcript>: yeah

02:54:34
<transcript>: Yeah. Here we go.

02:54:34
<transcript>: where

02:54:36
<transcript>: Where users.

<transcript>: Are you using sql instead of dynamo? I am Grasp. Yeah, we're using.

02:54:57
<transcript>: this is

<transcript>: O Vere is good.

02:55:03
itsmeleague: Famous last words

02:55:11
<transcript>: Just wait a bit. It won't look too good anymore. When Adam tries to do confetti or tries a new transition. Exactly. True.

02:55:11
<transcript>: exactly

02:55:13
<transcript>: Exactly.

02:55:15
<transcript>: Don't be.

02:55:29
<transcript>: Just jealous. Oh, don't be your Zoom and redemption, adam's. Greater than my fancy transitions, I got to spend more time in trash. What time do you stream, trav? I caught you one day. Just caught you. I was like, I know that avatar from Twitter.

02:55:29
<transcript>: but

02:55:32
<transcript>: But I don't know what time you normally stream.

02:55:37
<transcript>: Okay. We set the subscription status to subscription status.

02:55:37
<transcript>: where

02:55:40
<transcript>: Where stripe Customer ID is equal to customer.

02:55:40
<transcript>: okay

02:55:43
<transcript>: Okay. And then it's going to be execute.

02:55:50
<transcript>: First. Okay.

02:55:52
<transcript>: Let's do it.

02:55:56
<transcript>: Like comps response.

02:55:56
<transcript>: and then

02:55:59
<transcript>: And then log.

02:56:01
<transcript>: Console, log.

02:56:06
<transcript>: Okay.

02:56:11
<transcript>: Should I do like stringify it.

02:56:16

<transcript>: Let's look for Adam final. There he is. Adam final.

02:58:23
<transcript>: Adam.

02:58:23
<transcript>: final

02:58:24
<transcript>: Final.

02:58:24
<transcript>: oh

02:58:35
<transcript>: Oh, what am I looking at? I'm looking for the stats. There's a Customer ID. Active. Active. You see it? Look at that. Look at that. Active. Subscriber.

02:58:41
<transcript>: Who? It's been a whirlwind? But we did it so now.

02:58:41
<transcript>: i should

02:58:44
iannery: WOOO

02:58:45
<transcript>: I should be logged in. It redirected me. It logged me in most points in a game.

02:58:45
<transcript>: moment

02:58:46
aj_stuyvenberg: booom success

02:58:55
<transcript>: Moment of truth? Moment of truth? Did it block off a table? Does it think I'm a paid user now? Oh, no. The whole table is blocked off. Something changed.

02:58:58
mattmancodes: adamdevAdambar

02:59:01
zirus16: LOL

02:59:02
<transcript>: I've maybe never had a subscribed user to test this, so let's look at the front end code here.

02:59:04
itsmeleague: Ship it

02:59:05
silverlp: close enough

02:59:06
<transcript>: Oh, no. Back to elixirland.

02:59:08
<transcript>: Upgrade.

02:59:08
<transcript>: to

02:59:10
<transcript>: To pro.

02:59:10
<transcript>: so

02:59:12
<transcript>: So let's see here.

02:59:12
zirus16: normal behaviour in testing phase.

02:59:14
<transcript>: Limit.

02:59:16
unq_za: lgtm

02:59:18
<transcript>: Top if there is a limit.

02:59:22
<transcript>: We do that. Otherwise. Zero. Oh, yeah, no.

02:59:22
<transcript>: this

02:59:25
<transcript>: This whole thing should only be visible.

02:59:29
<transcript>: Ysat oh, no.

02:59:31
mattmancodes: it works, you got their money. There problem they can't see the table

02:59:38
<transcript>: This whole thing should only be visible if there's a limit.

02:59:43
<transcript>: That's not how I should do it, is it I should do limit.

02:59:47
<transcript>: Else null.

02:59:53
silverlp: cant you do ??

02:59:53
<transcript>: Right if there's no limit, there's definitely limit now so I can just say.

02:59:59
<transcript>: Oh no.

03:00:02
<transcript>: Cool.

03:00:05
<transcript>: Let's see it.

03:00:06
iannery: @SilverLP what does that do?

03:00:06
silverlp: o wait

03:00:12
<transcript>: Looks so beautiful. Look at it. No. Query, limit. Query away.

03:00:13
<transcript>: We did it.

03:00:13
<transcript>: we

03:00:14
silverlp: fuck shorthands

03:00:15
<transcript>: We did it.

03:00:20
<transcript>: I got their money. Their problem. They can't see a table.

03:00:21
mattmancodes: woop

03:00:23
<transcript>: We did it.

03:00:25
<transcript>: Look at me.

03:00:25
<transcript>: shipping something

03:00:26
<transcript>: Shipping something.

03:00:26
<transcript>: on a

03:00:30
unq_za: why is the ternary better than &&?

03:00:30
<transcript>: On a stream. I mean, there's still a lot to do.

03:00:33
<transcript>: But the main happy path.

03:00:33
<transcript>: done

03:00:37
2dorkstv: nice!

03:00:44
<transcript>: Done now. I need to try canceling my subscription, see if it updates the sas. Oh, I should try that right now. Should I just try that right now? I'll just try that right now. I was going to end the stream, but we can see.

03:00:44
<transcript>: i might even

03:00:46
itsmeleague: @unq_za if limit is 0 it will render 0

03:00:47
<transcript>: I might even have that working already. Right.

03:00:53
<transcript>: Think for the follow. Wait. What was that noise? Thank you. For something. Somebody did something. Thank you.

03:00:53
<transcript>: why is the terna

03:00:53
itsmeleague: If you use 11

03:00:56
greatgrievance: LuckyBull

03:00:57
itsmeleague: &&*

03:00:57
<transcript>: Why is the ternary better than yeah. It'll render zero. Exactly.

03:00:57
<transcript>: okay

03:00:59
<transcript>: Okay.

03:00:59
silverlp: @unq_za if limit returns a 0 it will display a 0

03:01:03
unq_za: @SilverLP fallback for undefined

03:01:04
<transcript>: Let's cancel my subscription. Let's just cancel it.

03:01:06
silverlp: 7 replies kek

03:01:06
unq_za: ah, thank!

03:01:10
<transcript>: How do I want to cancel it? Let's just go in here to customers we're going to find.

03:01:10
<transcript>: adam final

03:01:13
<transcript>: Adam final. And we're going to cancel that subscription.

03:01:20
<transcript>: I don't know how I'm going to do that yet. Here it is. Payment. Subscription. Cancel. Subscription.

03:01:22
<transcript>: Immediately.

03:01:27
itsmeleague: ?? Might work though since that checks for undefined

03:01:28
<transcript>: I don't want that subscription anymore.

03:01:28
<transcript>: okay

03:01:29
<transcript>: Okay.

03:01:29
<transcript>: now

03:01:34
<transcript>: Now, shall I just go straight to the app and see? Or should I do this.

03:01:37
<transcript>: Let's copy Adam finals ID.

03:01:41
<transcript>: And let's say.

03:01:41
<transcript>: select

03:01:45
<transcript>: Select all from users.

03:01:47
21givenchy: hii

03:01:48
<transcript>: Where ID equals.

03:01:52
<transcript>: Is that me.

03:01:52
<transcript>: that final yeah

03:01:55
<transcript>: That final. Yeah. Adam. Final. Cancel.

03:01:55
<transcript>: it

03:02:02
<transcript>: It worked. Now let's see if back here I don't know technology still amazes me every single time.

03:02:06
<transcript>: Every single time something works. I'm like, how does this work? We are.

03:02:06
<transcript>: talking

03:02:07
techsavvytravvy: Cheer100

03:02:09
<transcript>: Talking monkeys. And look at what we can do.

03:02:12
<transcript>: Okay. Well, it's not perfect.

03:02:12
<transcript>: did the thing

03:02:13
ocelot2123: Pog

03:02:14
goodgrandpaa: LUL true

03:02:18
<transcript>: Did the thing where the limit is. Yeah, it's not perfect, but it's doing something.

03:02:18
<transcript>: okay

03:02:19
<transcript>: Okay.

03:02:24
<transcript>: Might work, though, since that checks for undefined.

03:02:29
<transcript>: Okay. Seven replies. What were there? Seven replies to.

03:02:30
mattmancodes: still counts as a win

03:02:43
<transcript>: Tech Savvy travy. Thanks for the bits. That's what that noise was. Thank you so much for the bits.

03:02:50
<transcript>: Might work, though, since that checks were undefined. Yeah, I think the problem with doing the.

03:02:50
<transcript>: noel coale

03:02:52
techsavvytravvy: we're talking monkeys and look what we can do!

03:03:02
<transcript>: Noel coalescing operator is that in React people do it all the time. And then when your thing is like false, it'll render false. Like if it's some non truthy value that you did not expect.

03:03:06
<transcript>: That thing gets rendered right.

03:03:12
<transcript>: I think is what the problem is. I don't know. I pretend to know. React.

03:03:15
itsmeleague: Yes

03:03:15
<transcript>: Still counts as a win. It's a win.

03:03:15
<transcript>: we're talking monkeys

03:03:26
<transcript>: We're talking monkeys and look what we can do? Look at us floating around on a spaceship, spaceship Earth, flying through space. We can make computers do stuff.

03:03:26
<transcript>: how cool

03:03:32
<transcript>: How cool. What a cool profession. Big fan. I don't know why the music stopped. It's a little dramatic.

03:03:34
techsavvytravvy: hey. look at us.

03:03:35
<transcript>: It could keep going. And it would be fine.

03:03:38
<transcript>: There we go. No.

03:03:38
<transcript>: it stopped

03:03:41
<transcript>: It stopped it. It literally stopped it from playing.

03:03:41
<transcript>: okay

03:03:44
<transcript>: Okay. Well, it's been so fun today.

03:03:44
<transcript>: how fun

03:03:47
<transcript>: How fun is it to ship stuff on stream.

03:03:47
<transcript>: extremely fun

03:03:55
<transcript>: Extremely fun. I mean, I didn't ship it. Technically, it's still locally on my machine. It's not even on github, but how fun.

03:03:57
<transcript>: Hey, look at us.

03:03:59
<transcript>: All right.

03:04:01
techsavvytravvy: lol

03:04:02
<transcript>: I'm going to end on a high note.

03:04:04
goodgrandpaa: you're a coder adam! woohoo! LUL

03:04:09
<transcript>: It's been real. It's been fun. It's been real fun. Maybe we could do it again sometime.

03:04:13
itsmeleague: See you next time

03:04:16
overra_dev: <3

03:04:22
iannery: started from the bottom now we still on the bottom but a little higher up

03:04:32
silverlp: bye bye

03:05:01
techsavvytravvy: what's happening

03:05:09
goodgrandpaa: Ending stream :)

03:05:12
aj_stuyvenberg: byeeeee

03:05:13
goodgrandpaa: But into a raid
