00:11:41
<transcript>: well i

00:11:42
tnkhanh: yeah okay lol

00:11:46
<transcript>: Well, I like hours from now. Like when it starts in like 8 hours.

00:11:55
<transcript>: You have a better name. You'd like me to go by or you'd like to go by team case you just let me know.

00:11:56
<transcript>: I.

00:11:56
<transcript>: keep a pretty good

00:12:01
<transcript>: Keep a pretty good map of people's usernames.

00:12:01
<transcript>: to

00:12:03
<transcript>: To thing they want me to call them.

00:12:03
<transcript>: sometimes it breaks down

00:12:05
<transcript>: Sometimes it breaks down.

00:12:05
<transcript>: but

00:12:06
<transcript>: But I try.

00:12:06
<transcript>: the more

00:12:09
tnkhanh: yes, great name!

00:12:09
<transcript>: The more you're here, the more likely it'll stay.

00:12:14
<transcript>: T and Case good. Okay, cool.

00:12:14
<transcript>: t and k

00:12:15
<transcript>: T and K, it is.

00:12:20
<transcript>: I really I can't decide I can't decide today.

00:12:20
<transcript>: if i want to go

00:12:22
<transcript>: If I want to go back to AW guess.

00:12:25
<transcript>: Which just has to be done for reinvent.

00:12:25
<transcript>: or

00:12:32
<transcript>: Or if I want to work on what we did yesterday, if we want to mess with stability AI or I mean.

00:12:32
<transcript>: the thing

00:12:35
<transcript>: The Thing stable diffusion.

00:12:45
<transcript>: I thought like maybe we could do this in Stage maker. Maybe we could actually train.

00:12:49
<transcript>: We might well spend we'll time box it.

00:12:51
<transcript>: We'll spend a little time.

00:12:54
<transcript>: Googling.

00:12:54
<transcript>: and

00:12:58
<transcript>: And seeing if it's possible to run.

00:12:58
<transcript>: stable

00:13:00
<transcript>: Stable diffusion in Sage maker.

00:13:12
<transcript>: Because Sage Maker has like ways to do custom models and stuff. And even like notebooks, I think you can do like Sage Maker notebooks. So then maybe at least I'm working within my DBS account.

00:13:12
<transcript>: and i

00:13:14
<transcript>: And I could hit.

00:13:14
<transcript>: i could hit

00:13:16
<transcript>: I could hit it with an API.

00:13:16
<transcript>: to do

00:13:19
<transcript>: To do inferences. Maybe. I don't know. We'll see.

00:13:19
<transcript>: and then

00:13:23
<transcript>: And then we'll go back to AWS at some point today and then later.

00:13:23
<transcript>: we'll just

00:13:27
<transcript>: We'll just watch next Conf who's here for like 10 hours? Anybody.

00:13:34
<transcript>: 6 hours would be noon I want to be less than that in like 5 hours.

00:13:34
<transcript>: five hours

00:13:37
<transcript>: 5 hours. We'll start something like that.

00:13:40
<transcript>: So.

00:13:42
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:13:42
<transcript>: hang

00:13:44
<transcript>: Hang out with me.

00:13:44
<transcript>: all day

00:13:45
<transcript>: how about it

00:13:47
<transcript>: How about it.

00:13:49
<transcript>: Gigos here.

00:13:51
<transcript>: Okay.

00:13:51
<transcript>: setting

00:13:55
<transcript>: Setting up stable Fusion in Dream Booth. Is that what we're doing.

00:13:55
<transcript>: is that

00:13:58
<transcript>: Is that what we're doing? I think so.

00:13:58
<transcript>: i think that

00:14:00
<transcript>: I think that's what we're doing.

00:14:04
<transcript>: Next is comp. Here's the speaker list.

00:14:21
<transcript>: I've just been looking at all the pictures of the mall hanging out. Just not having fun. No, I'm having so much fun, though. So much.

00:14:26
<transcript>: Next year, I It's like everybody goes to these things.

00:14:29
<transcript>: Prime is even going prime doesn't.

00:14:29
<transcript>: probably never even

00:14:33
<transcript>: Probably never even use next year. You didn't know what it was when he's going.

00:14:35
<transcript>: Oh, man.

00:14:40
<transcript>: Okay. So this is our dream booth.

00:14:40
<transcript>: let's see

00:14:41
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:14:45
<transcript>: What did I do in here? We made a CDK project. That's right.

00:14:45
<transcript>: so let's see

00:14:48
<transcript>: So let's see. Stable diffusion.

00:14:48
<transcript>: on

00:14:50
<transcript>: On Sage maker.

00:14:58
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:14:58
<transcript>: oh sage

00:15:00
<transcript>: Oh Sage maker.

00:15:10
<transcript>: There is a.

00:15:12
<transcript>: Dracula.

00:15:16
ziko008: have you read this? https://www.epicweb.dev/the-webs-next-transition

00:15:16
<transcript>: There's a PR yesterday.

00:15:18
<transcript>: I was like.

00:15:18
<transcript>: this

00:15:19
<transcript>: This good.

00:15:19
<transcript>: and

00:15:22
<transcript>: And then I felt kind of bad.

00:15:22
<transcript>: but then

00:15:24
<transcript>: But then they merged it.

00:15:27
<transcript>: So saying.

00:15:29
<transcript>: Saying this good.

00:15:30
<transcript>: Apparently.

00:15:34
<transcript>: Apparently, it led to some action. You know, I'm saying.

00:15:34
<transcript>: done

00:15:35
<transcript>: Done.

00:15:40
<transcript>: And now we should be able to let's actually do that real quick.

00:15:48
<transcript>: Let's do this.

00:15:50
<transcript>: Let's go into our plug.

00:15:50
<transcript>: plugins

00:15:52
<transcript>: Plugins.

00:15:55
<transcript>: Where is it? This one.

00:16:00
<transcript>: And let's just use drag.

00:16:06
<transcript>: What is it? Dracula. Vin. I think.

00:16:09
<transcript>: Yes.

00:16:13
tnkhanh: so many plugins Kreygasm

00:16:17
<transcript>: Lots of update.

00:16:21
<transcript>: Well.

00:16:21
<transcript>: did dra

00:16:28
andom: Howdy HeyGuys

00:16:31
<transcript>: Did Dracula get updated? I don't. They merged it. I don't know. That that means. Oh, yeah. Install Dracula Vim. Well, I guess I don't know if it's latest or not. Let's see.

00:16:33
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:16:37
<transcript>: You'd probably fix that deprecated thing.

00:16:41
<transcript>: Yeah. Colors look good. Cool.

00:16:49
<transcript>: So that's that's why we comment. That's why we do that.

00:16:51
<transcript>: Okay.

00:16:59
<transcript>: Is that that is. Aw, guess here's my dream booth.

00:17:06
<transcript>: Sage maker.

00:17:26
<transcript>: I think you can just run like arbitrary Python stuff in Sage Maker notebooks. Right.

00:17:29
<transcript>: Age Maker notebook.

00:17:35
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:17:35
<transcript>: sage

00:17:38
<transcript>: Sage Maker Studio notebooks.

00:17:38
<transcript>: sounds

00:17:40
<transcript>: Sounds right.

00:17:41
<transcript>: And.

00:17:46
<transcript>: Ziko have I read.

00:17:46
<transcript>: this

00:17:47
<transcript>: This.

00:17:47
<transcript>: epic

00:17:49
<transcript>: Epic web.

00:17:49
<transcript>: the webs

00:17:55
<transcript>: The Webs Next transition. I have not, but I'm very curious. So many people.

00:18:02
<transcript>: I feel like today's next year's. Conf is a big deal.

00:18:05
<transcript>: It's a big deal because.

00:18:05
<transcript>: we're just

00:18:08
<transcript>: We're just at this weird critical moment.

00:18:11
<transcript>: On this timeline.

00:18:12
<transcript>: Where.

00:18:12
<transcript>: we're still

00:18:18
<transcript>: We're still so far from where things should be I feel like but.

00:18:33
<transcript>: I feel like the big debate, the big MPA and Spa, and how much JavaScript should you ship? All of that is sort of coming to a head. And I think today's actually a conference is gonna answer a lot of questions.

00:18:36
daglee: nextjs = rust in the browser? Kappa

00:18:37
<transcript>: So.

00:18:37
<transcript>: those can

00:18:39
<transcript>: Those can Dods.

00:18:47
<transcript>: Does it like remix? Is the answer or is it more nuanced than that? Published the 20th. Okay, so this is very recent.

00:18:49
daglee: (bad joke)

00:18:50
<transcript>: Made of technologies that got their start over 20.

00:18:53
<transcript>: So this is like.

00:18:58
<transcript>: He's doing his course on Epic web Dev.

00:18:58
<transcript>: and this

00:19:07
<transcript>: And this is a big article talking about his take on the future. This is a big article. I think it is speaking to what I'm talking about here, which is.

00:19:11
<transcript>: We're at this kind of like turning point. There's a C change happening.

00:19:16
<transcript>: Spa.

00:19:19
<transcript>: Yeah. I mean everything's.

00:19:19
<transcript>: everything

00:19:23
<transcript>: Everything's sort of like coming to a head. I'm very curious.

00:19:25
<transcript>: What we're gonna see today.

00:19:25
<transcript>: next year s

00:19:27
<transcript>: Next year S equals rest in the browser.

00:19:32
<transcript>: Thanks for following Ryan Python. Appreciate that.

00:19:39
<transcript>: All right, let's let's play with. Let's play with this stuff, GIGO. Thank you so much for the prime sub. Hey.

00:19:39
<transcript>: i see you

00:19:43
<transcript>: I see you. Thank you. I appreciate that.

00:19:52
<transcript>: So we're gonna play with stable diffusion. We're gonna try to get a.

00:19:56
<transcript>: Better.

00:19:57
gigo6000: adamdo8DealWithIt

00:19:59
<transcript>: Oh, Geez Oh, Geez.

00:20:03
<transcript>: Oh, Jeez.

00:20:06
<transcript>: Did I leak anything? I don't think so.

00:20:08
<transcript>: I don't think so, Tim.

00:20:11
shenril: Sagemaker is becoming such a hydra monster :D 50 services under the same name

00:20:14
<transcript>: See my password and you know how my UBike so.

00:20:14
<transcript>: bad request

00:20:15
<transcript>: Bad request.

00:20:15
<transcript>: think i

00:20:19
<transcript>: Think I did get a response to this, but I think it's like.

00:20:21
<transcript>: They're gonna need more time.

00:20:28
<transcript>: Yeah, General. It really is Sage maker means lots of things.

00:20:31
<transcript>: It means, oh, so many things.

00:20:31
<transcript>: there's

00:20:32
<transcript>: There's a lot of.

00:20:32
<transcript>: services

00:20:35
<transcript>: Services under the Sage Maker umbrella.

00:20:41
<transcript>: Okay. Apparently. Oh, there we go. Limit instance.

00:20:41
<transcript>: let's see

00:20:44
<transcript>: Let's see. I don't think this is resolved yet.

00:20:44
<transcript>: take some

00:20:55
<transcript>: Take some time. Okay. Yeah. So now I'm asking for access to all Accelerated instances, but I think I think we use Sage Maker Notebooks. I think that's.

00:20:55
<transcript>: okay

00:20:56
<transcript>: Okay.

00:21:04
<transcript>: Twitch is telling me this is a good time to remind viewers to follow me so they can catch your next stream. Hey, viewers.

00:21:04
<transcript>: you should follow

00:21:06
<transcript>: You should follow me so you can catch my next stream.

00:21:09
<transcript>: How awful is that.

00:21:13
<transcript>: 's Funny. I don't know why that popped up.

00:21:21
<transcript>: So I kind of want to, like, hit the pull of the bullet points of this thing. I don't want to read this whole article.

00:21:21
<transcript>: on

00:21:23
<transcript>: On stream.

00:21:26
<transcript>: I don't think.

00:21:29
<transcript>: That'll be very entertaining.

00:21:36
<transcript>: I don't know if what I do normally is entertaining, but I don't think this would be entertaining. Is there a let's see? Is there conclusion.

00:21:36
<transcript>: conclusion

00:21:37
<transcript>: Conclusion.

00:21:37
<transcript>: okay

00:21:39
<transcript>: Okay. Here we are.

00:21:46
<transcript>: Conclusion. Personally, I'm Super here for this transition. Transition's. A good way.

00:21:46
<transcript>: it's kind of what we're in

00:21:56
<transcript>: It's kind of what we're in. We're in a transition, getting a better UX and DX at the same time as a solid win. I think it's an important one, and I'm excited about the future holds for us as a reward to you for finishing this blog post.

00:21:58
<transcript>: Who's gonna tell him.

00:21:58
<transcript>: i've made

00:22:12
<transcript>: I've made a repository that demonstrates all this code moving around through the ages using a to do MVC app. Find it here. Hopefully it helps make some of the ideas more concrete. And this is what I'm excited to teach you here on Epic web Dev.

00:22:19
<transcript>: Let's make the web better, faster.

00:22:19
<transcript>: that's almost

00:22:24
<transcript>: That's almost the next JS. What do they say? Make what is it.

00:22:27
<transcript>: Make the web.

00:22:27
<transcript>: dynamic

00:22:29
<transcript>: Dynamic without limits.

00:22:34
shenril: took me a year to be back into the frontend game , you mean it's gonna change again ? :D

00:22:38
<transcript>: Today they're so Apple Versaille is so Apple if there has ever been an Apple in Tech, it's for sell.

00:22:42
<transcript>: Like their events, are turning into Apple events.

00:22:42
<transcript>: all

00:22:44
<transcript>: All their marketing is so polished.

00:22:44
<transcript>: and glossy

00:22:47
<transcript>: And glossy like.

00:22:47
<transcript>: apple

00:22:55
<transcript>: Apple, but just the fact that they have like a slogan for the conference today, dining it with that limits that's so Apple, I can't even I can't even.

00:22:58
<transcript>: But what's their what is it.

00:23:01
<transcript>: Online Experience Developers love.

00:23:05
<transcript>: Where is their little like make the web faster.

00:23:05
<transcript>: vers

00:23:08
<transcript>: Versailles.

00:23:11
<transcript>: Where is it.

00:23:15
<transcript>: The bottom.

00:23:18
<transcript>: You know I'm talking about anybody.

00:23:23
<transcript>: I know they have like that.

00:23:28
<transcript>: Versa. I'll make the web.

00:23:34
<transcript>: Am I making this up.

00:23:34
<transcript>: let's

00:23:37
<transcript>: Let's make the web faster.

00:23:37
<transcript>: so that's

00:23:43
<transcript>: So that's next year's. Comp. 2021. But I saw it on physical signage in San Francisco.

00:23:43
<transcript>: in

00:23:49
<transcript>: In a picture. I didn't go to San Francisco right now. I'm not in San Francisco.

00:23:49
<transcript>: took me a

00:23:54
<transcript>: Took me a year to be back into the frontend game. You mean it's gonna change games? Yeah. I think it's gonna change for the better, though.

00:23:57
<transcript>: Think it's for the better.

00:24:11
<transcript>: If you're like me and you've been doing React development. When you say frontend development, if it's react, I just I think there's a lot of things that could be a lot better.

00:24:13
<transcript>: It's just.

00:24:13
<transcript>: i've said i

00:24:18
<transcript>: I've said I said it yesterday. I don't think after eight years, me struggling with react is my fault.

00:24:22
stroopwafel26: Hi there adamdo8DealWithIt

00:24:23
<transcript>: I've been building with React long enough. It should have clicked by now.

00:24:23
<transcript>: so

00:24:31
<transcript>: So we're definitely returning to a world whether you're just using Forms the way the browser is meant to work with forms.

00:24:33
<transcript>: That's coming.

00:24:41
<transcript>: Progressive enhancement how many times? Let's see progressive.

00:24:46
<transcript>: Progressive 22 times in this article.

00:24:51
<transcript>: Progressively enhanced. That's the theme right now we're talking about.

00:24:53
<transcript>: Minimal JavaScript.

00:25:02
<transcript>: Okay. That's enough of that. Let's let's make let's make dream booth thing.

00:25:02
<transcript>: hey there

00:25:04
<transcript>: Hey there's. Stroop. Stroop is here.

00:25:08
<transcript>: We're gonna be here for, like.

00:25:08
<transcript>: ten hours

00:25:10
<transcript>: 10 hours troop. Something like that I don't know.

00:25:15
<transcript>: More like 8 hours eight hour stream.

00:25:15
<transcript>: ish

00:25:16
<transcript>: Ish.

00:25:16
<transcript>: eight hours

00:25:19
subwaytime_: Hey there! Back in the chat :P Interesting that there is so much issues going on with react.. good that i only have to deal with vue :D

00:25:19
stroopwafel26: 10 hours!

00:25:22
<transcript>: 8 hours. Yeah, it'll be about eight days because we're gonna watch some of next JS. Comp later.

00:25:25
<transcript>: A little watch party.

00:25:28
<transcript>: I don't know if I've ever done.

00:25:28
<transcript>: an eight

00:25:31
<transcript>: An eight hour stream. I don't think I have.

00:25:34
<transcript>: I'm pretty sure I have not.

00:25:34
<transcript>: also

00:25:40
<transcript>: Also I'm pretty sure I don't hear anything right now and that is bother something.

00:25:40
stroopwafel26: best I can do is 2,5 hours

00:25:42
<transcript>: Where is. Let's see.

00:25:44
<transcript>: This.

00:25:47
<transcript>: No.

00:25:50
<transcript>: Things.

00:25:54
<transcript>: Audio.

00:25:59
<transcript>: If I'm gonna be here 8 hours with you people then I need.

00:26:04
<transcript>: I need to build it. Here. Notifications. Okay.

00:26:06
<transcript>: Okay.

00:26:06
<transcript>: i hope it's

00:26:09
<transcript>: I hope it's working now.

00:26:15
stroopwafel26: *slaps stream* this bad boy can fit so many hours

00:26:16
<transcript>: So let's play with, let's play with a Sage Maker notebook.

00:26:21
<transcript>: Easy to instance type oh if I don't have GPUs, I may still not be able to do this.

00:26:21
<transcript>: i guess we do the

00:26:25
<transcript>: I guess we do the Google CalLab thing so dream booth.

00:26:28
<transcript>: Diffusion.

00:26:28
<transcript>: notebook

00:26:29
<transcript>: Notebook.

00:26:42
<transcript>: Just forget about the idea of making an API on top of it. We just play with, oh, here we go. Collaboratory does this work people yesterday. I think somebody said it didn't work.

00:26:46
<transcript>: But we're gonna try.

00:26:50
<transcript>: So this is a Google.

00:26:52
<transcript>: Co lab.

00:26:57
<transcript>: Check type of GPU and V room VRAM available.

00:26:59
<transcript>: Tesla T four.

00:26:59
<transcript>: can i

00:27:04
<transcript>: Can I like pay to get a better one or something.

00:27:16
<transcript>: Have experience with these.

00:27:16
<transcript>: colabs

00:27:17
<transcript>: Colabs.

00:27:17
<transcript>: this notebook

00:27:20
<transcript>: This notebook was not authored by Google.

00:27:20
<transcript>: i'm

00:27:23
<transcript>: I'm good with that. That's fine.

00:27:33
<transcript>: Yeah, I would I would definitely pay for more resources if it will let me.

00:27:37
<transcript>: Python Three Google Computebacked engine.

00:27:41
<transcript>: Collect more memory and dispace. Yes.

00:27:46
<transcript>: Colab pro.

00:27:49
<transcript>: A hundred compute units per month.

00:27:49
<transcript>: or

00:27:53
<transcript>: Or 500 faster, faster GPUs.

00:27:53
<transcript>: priority

00:27:57
<transcript>: Priority access to upgrades a more powerful Premium GPUs.

00:27:57
<transcript>: access

00:28:04
<transcript>: Access our higher memory machines. Upgrade your notebooks to keep executing for up to 24 hours, even if you close your browser. Okay, let's do this one.

00:28:04
<transcript>: what

00:28:07
<transcript>: What pays you go.

00:28:07
<transcript>: we're just

00:28:09
<transcript>: We're just gonna do this one.

00:28:11
<transcript>: Okay.

00:28:16
<transcript>: That's right card. We'll find out.

00:28:20
<transcript>: Sign up Successful. Let's go.

00:28:23
<transcript>: Okay.

00:28:23
<transcript>: do we have

00:28:24
<transcript>: Do we have better.

00:28:26
<transcript>: Now.

00:28:40
<transcript>: Request new runtime. You can reset your current runtime. Take advantage of your new subscription or continue and it'll take effect for all new let's request new runtime. Disconnect and delete. Yes, this is way easier than setting up Stephan AWS.

00:28:40
<transcript>: i kind of like

00:28:42
<transcript>: I kind of like it.

00:28:46
<transcript>: Subway time.

00:28:46
<transcript>: hey

00:28:52
<transcript>: Hey there back in the chat. Interesting that there's so much issues going on with react. Good that I only have to deal with you.

00:28:58
<transcript>: 10 hours. Not today. Yeah. Two, two, 5 hours. Okay, I'll take it.

00:29:01
<transcript>: That will fit so many hours.

00:29:07
<transcript>: Okay 500 compute units.

00:29:10
<transcript>: Okay, manage sessions.

00:29:10
<transcript>: oh

00:29:12
<transcript>: Oh change runtime type.

00:29:17
<transcript>: Gpu, or TPU.

00:29:21
<transcript>: Premium.

00:29:23
<transcript>: Piram.

00:29:24
stroopwafel26: Google Colab looks sweet

00:29:28
<transcript>: Okay, what is the TPU.

00:29:33
<transcript>: One is a TPU anybody know.

00:29:36
<transcript>: knows

00:29:36
<transcript>: knows that tpu

00:29:38
vim_cerf: Tensorflow accelerator thing

00:29:39
<transcript>: Knows that TPU is in the word output. There we go.

00:29:42
<transcript>: Gpm TPU.

00:29:53
<transcript>: Cheap use in Colab. What is that? Tensor? What is that.

00:29:53
stroopwafel26: TPU is tensor cores

00:30:01
stroopwafel26: it's for ML

00:30:05
<transcript>: Lightning fast cloud TPUs.

00:30:07
<transcript>: Google.

00:30:07
<transcript>: column

00:30:10
<transcript>: Column TPU Verse GPU.

00:30:19
<transcript>: These tensor cores. It's for Ml. Well, that's what we're doing TensorFlow accelerator thing. If we're not using Tints or Flow, does it help us.

00:30:21
<transcript>: Amen up.

00:30:24
<transcript>: Like if we're doing.

00:30:28
<transcript>: In this case, we're gonna be doing some Pi torch stuff.

00:30:31
<transcript>: Hi, torch.

00:30:33
<transcript>: Does it help me.

00:30:34
stroopwafel26: for this use-case you're better off with a GPU

00:30:41
<transcript>: Better off with the DPU. Okay.

00:30:46
<transcript>: So that would only help if I were doing TensorFlow. Is that the idea.

00:30:50
<transcript>: Just want to have a good mental model, you know.

00:30:57
<transcript>: High Torch Cloud TPUs.

00:31:15
<transcript>: Network attached GPU host plus four Tpuz, two chips.

00:31:22
<transcript>: Are you sure? Stream.

00:31:22
<transcript>: you sure

00:31:27
<transcript>: You sure I should use a GPU? I feel like TPU might just be more beefy.

00:31:37
<transcript>: Torch.

00:31:39
<transcript>: Google.

00:31:39
<transcript>: cpu

00:31:41
<transcript>: Cpu for CPU.

00:31:48
<transcript>: Oh, I think just said what you said.

00:31:48
<transcript>: stroop

00:31:50
<transcript>: Stroop.

00:32:00
<transcript>: Writing these lines running pipe horse code on TPUs is not a wellrearded path natural TVs have been optimized for and mainly use a TensorFlow, but Kaggle and Google distribute free TPU.

00:32:04
thdxr: is Adam going to sign up for Google cloud

00:32:07
<transcript>: Performance.

00:32:12
<transcript>: Comparison? Here we go.

00:32:14
<transcript>: Cpu.

00:32:21
<transcript>: Am I seeing here.

00:32:27
<transcript>: Four times slower than all eight cores together.

00:32:29
<transcript>: Okay.

00:32:37
<transcript>: I'm gonna sign up for Google Cloud. You know it, DAX. I'm already signed up. I'm in. Really in. I've used it for something.

00:32:40
<transcript>: I just. I.

00:32:40
<transcript>: don't

00:32:50
<transcript>: Don't I don't enjoy Google. I just think Google has better like they're in them models are better, like their vision stuff and their speech stuff. We did a lot of speech stuff at statmeus.

00:32:50
<transcript>: back

00:33:05
<transcript>: Back when and Google invested in staff. So I had reasons. We had lots of credits, lots of Google cut credits. But yeah, they're speeched. I think all there, like Ml pre train stuff is better than the Atoms stuff. In my opinion.

00:33:12
<transcript>: Okay.

00:33:14
<transcript>: So now I'm ready.

00:33:14
<transcript>: what

00:33:16
iva_van: there is tensorflow.js but i do not work with it

00:33:17
<transcript>: What am I doing? Connecting.

00:33:17
<transcript>: host

00:33:19
<transcript>: Hosted runtime.

00:33:21
<transcript>: Manage sessions.

00:33:27
<transcript>: So this is TPUs and Colab. Okay, did I choose TPUs? I guess.

00:33:32
21_blu3: Hi there, just discovered your profile,

00:33:36
<transcript>: Well, alright. Let's do it. Enabling and testing is you. Wait. What is this? Oh, this is not what I thought it was. This is what I thought. Yeah.

00:33:40
21_blu3: do you mind asking some questions

00:33:48
<transcript>: I just want to know I want to know if TPU is better.

00:33:51
<transcript>: Street. You think it's, you think it's GPU.

00:33:58
<transcript>: There's TensorFlow JS, but I do not work with it. Welcome to Chat Iva.

00:33:58
<transcript>: also welcome

00:34:05
<transcript>: Also, welcome to Chat 21 Blue. Just discover your profile. Do you mind asking some questions? I don't have any questions.

00:34:14
<transcript>: I wouldn't mind to ask them. I just don't have any. You can ask me some questions. Is that you met? Do you mind asking some? Do you mind if you ask some questions? Go for it.

00:34:20
<transcript>: Premium.

00:34:20
<transcript>: high ram

00:34:21
<transcript>: High Ram. Let's do it.

00:34:26
<transcript>: Okay, Dream Booth Stale of fusion.

00:34:29
<transcript>: Tesla T four. What is that.

00:34:32
<transcript>: Oh, show covered? Here we go.

00:34:36
<transcript>: Let's run that again because I don't think that was run on our thing.

00:34:42
<transcript>: An, A 140 Gigs of Ram Feels good.

00:34:45
<transcript>: Sir.

00:34:50
<transcript>: I like this. Wait a minute. I have two sessions.

00:34:50
<transcript>: i don't need

00:34:52
<transcript>: I don't need this one. Terminate that one.

00:34:54
<transcript>: Okay.

00:35:00
<transcript>: Install requirements. Let's do it. So we're getting some things. What are we getting.

00:35:08
<transcript>: Convert diffusers to original stables using train dream booth I'm gonna just trust that this person made a collab that was good.

00:35:12
<transcript>: That's that a terrible assumption.

00:35:12
<transcript>: so i can

00:35:15
<transcript>: So I can fill the screen up with this thing.

00:35:28
<transcript>: I don't know. I'm trusting. I'm a trusting individual. Sound real. Thank you so much for the sub. I didn't hear anything in my ears, so I don't know if that. I think it just happened.

00:35:30
<transcript>: Thank you so much.

00:35:30
21_blu3: so i just read your bio, and im thinking your might be the right person to ask.   am i front-end dev student, who started 2 months ago, i want to ask for some advice/tips you can give me

00:35:34
<transcript>: Sandrial. I really appreciate that.

00:35:34
<transcript>: for most

00:35:37
<transcript>: For most wait four months.

00:35:37
<transcript>: is

00:35:38
<transcript>: Is that right.

00:35:38
<transcript>: have i been doing this

00:35:44
<transcript>: Have I been doing this long enough? You'd have four months. I don't even think there's a four month badge, is there.

00:35:47
<transcript>: Even no.

00:35:54
<transcript>: Wait a minute. Do I have a four month batch? Or maybe it goes from three to six or something.

00:36:02
<transcript>: Sandra, You're the first person I've seen with four months on my stream because I'm pretty sure.

00:36:02
<transcript>: that's

00:36:04
<transcript>: That's.

00:36:04
<transcript>: like

00:36:06
stroopwafel26: sorry, i'm back, someone called me, who even does that anymore?!

00:36:08
<transcript>: Like I've only barely been doing this long enough for you to.

00:36:10
<transcript>: Be able to have four months.

00:36:16
21_blu3: its a kind of a school which takes 1 year and 9 months, where they will teach us, html, css, js

00:36:17
<transcript>: Some called you Stroop. You got a phone call? I remember I used to get a lot of phone calls.

00:36:17
<transcript>: did it did it

00:36:23
<transcript>: Did it. Did it do it over. Done. I'm just sitting here like an idiot. We're done. This happened.

00:36:23
<transcript>: we're okay

00:36:26
<transcript>: We're okay. So we've installed that stuff.

00:36:27
stroopwafel26: pepperidge farm remembers

00:36:32
<transcript>: Now we're logging into hugging face, so I need a hugging face token.

00:36:39
<transcript>: Okay. And I'm gonna have to blur this out.

00:36:39
<transcript>: you know i'm

00:36:42
<transcript>: You know, I'm saying, stable fusion. What is this.

00:36:42
<transcript>: hu

00:36:43
stroopwafel26: I sometimes forget my iPhone also makes calls

00:36:44
<transcript>: Hugging face.

00:36:44
<transcript>: you need to

00:36:59
<transcript>: You need to agree to share content information to access this model. Sign up. I am not on hugging face. This is new for me. Oh, Geez, can't use that. Okay, hang on. Fuzzy time. Where's my. Where's my. There it is.

00:37:02
<transcript>: Why is that fuzzy button not working anymore? Oh, work.

00:37:02
<transcript>: hey yes

00:37:06
<transcript>: Hey yesterday OBS very broken today.

00:37:06
<transcript>: appears to be

00:37:08
<transcript>: Appears to be less broken.

00:37:10
<transcript>: That's good.

00:37:10
<transcript>: okay

00:37:13
<transcript>: Okay. Now I can use that one.

00:37:17
<transcript>: Username.

00:37:17
<transcript>: thank you

00:37:17
thdxr: always been so confused about hugging face, such a weird name

00:37:20
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the follow ambassum.

00:37:24
sondreal: Time goes fast when enjoyed! And I enjoy my stay here adamdo8Adambar

00:37:25
<transcript>: Thank you so much. Do I have to do all this username.

00:37:25
<transcript>: i don't know

00:37:27
<transcript>: I don't know.

00:37:29
<transcript>: Guess I'm gonna do it.

00:37:32
<transcript>: Just give everybody my? Oh, that's optionally.

00:37:36
<transcript>: Give them all my PII.

00:37:40
<transcript>: Okay.

00:37:45
<transcript>: Well.

00:37:48
<transcript>: Lost my browser. Where did it go.

00:37:57
<transcript>: I just unmaximized. And it's gone. Oh, there it is.

00:38:01
<transcript>: Alright, let's listen to music if we're gonna be.

00:38:08
<transcript>: Hanging out for like 8 hours today we're gonna listen to music while we do it, you know.

00:38:11
<transcript>: Okay.

00:38:14
<transcript>: I've read, I know I'm still on secret mode.

00:38:14
<transcript>: but

00:38:17
<transcript>: But that's for a reason.

00:38:22
<transcript>: Because I'm getting ready to grab, like, a key or something.

00:38:24
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:38:35
<transcript>: You accept the Model Ice for downloading or using Sales version Model Card read License Yep have to be a register user. You also need an access token for the code to work.

00:38:35
<transcript>: let's get

00:38:37
<transcript>: Let's get an access token.

00:38:43
<transcript>: Access.

00:38:43
<transcript>: token

00:38:44
<transcript>: Token.

00:38:45
21_blu3: i want to become a full-stack dev, and move into blockchain development later on my career

00:38:48
<transcript>: Oh, I have to confirm my email.

00:39:04
<transcript>: 21 blue. So I read your bio. I'm thinking you might be the right person to ask. I'm a frontend Dev student. Start two months ago. Ask for some advice tips you can give me.

00:39:08
<transcript>: Build things that's generally the consensus.

00:39:08
<transcript>: everyone

00:39:11
<transcript>: Everyone in Chat comes up with the same answer, which is.

00:39:11
<transcript>: try to build

00:39:16
<transcript>: Try to build things, trying to get too stuck in just reading and learning without actually applying.

00:39:16
<transcript>: that probably

00:39:19
<transcript>: That probably goes for lots of things. But.

00:39:23
<transcript>: Another thing. Actually. You know what? Hang on.

00:39:32
<transcript>: Actually have something to say about this. I'm maybe gonna create a YouTube video depends on how much I have to say here. If I don't have to say much, then I won't do a video.

00:39:32
<transcript>: i think

00:39:37
<transcript>: I think here's the thing I think about the industry. I've probably said this before.

00:39:40
<transcript>: It seems like all new developers.

00:39:40
<transcript>: are funneled

00:39:45
21_blu3: when should i move on to React? and should i learn JS first? or jump into React?

00:39:50
<transcript>: Are funneled into frontend. Device doesn't seem like that. It's reality. Like we funnel new engineers into frontend. And I think.

00:39:50
<transcript>: i think

00:39:54
<transcript>: I think that's because of the feedback loop. I think we've had this conversation.

00:39:54
<transcript>: dax that i

00:39:56
<transcript>: Dax, that I had this conversation with you.

00:40:17
<transcript>: It's probably because the feedback loop, like building the front end, like you can see the page, you can make changes, you can see it changed. That's probably very fulfilling. But I think all so we funnel most people to react. It's kind of like the biggest player in the ecosystem. And learning react is the first thing or one of the first things you're learning as a developer feels bad. I just don't think, like.

00:40:21
<transcript>: You're having to learn so many different things for the front end.

00:40:21
<transcript>: how to make

00:40:29
thdxr: when I started I did it through CLI apps, windows forms (barely frontend) and normal web frontend came later through php

00:40:33
<transcript>: How to make it look nice because you care. A lot of people probably care what it looks like. So if you're like coming into the field, you want to learn how to program. And the first thing is you're like learning or like react hooks.

00:40:36
<transcript>: Ouch, Ouch, right.

00:40:36
<transcript>: am i

00:40:37
thdxr: very different than jumping into react

00:40:40
<transcript>: Am I crazy to think that maybe maybe.

00:40:40
<transcript>: there are other

00:40:48
<transcript>: There are other pads or just other things to get exposed to. To maybe make sure you really enjoy it. Get hooked a little bit before you get confronted with react.

00:40:48
<transcript>: like

00:40:51
<transcript>: Like I would love to see more new developers.

00:40:51
<transcript>: kind of funnel

00:40:57
<transcript>: Kind of funneled into, like, hey, let's build some really, like, cool CLI's. Not like.

00:40:57
<transcript>: ty pillow

00:41:00
<transcript>: Ty pillow get back world like that kind of stuff.

00:41:20
<transcript>: I don't know. It's like the Todo app equivalent in frontend land. Why not like build out a CLI. The interacts with APIs does stuff right get the weather or something. Like I feel like that you're learning some stuff about programming, about fetching data and about all the kind of condition stuff you might do in a CLI, but you don't have to think.

00:41:20
<transcript>: about a front

00:41:24
<transcript>: About a front end. You don't have to think about all of the nonsense.

00:41:32
<transcript>: In React or about CSS and styling. Like all these different things you have to be confronted with when you're rendering your thing in the browser.

00:41:32
<transcript>: in a cli it's

00:41:35
<transcript>: In a CLI. It's like output, tablet.

00:41:35
<transcript>: right

00:41:40
thdxr: yeah CLI for getting weather covers A LOT

00:41:44
<transcript>: Right? Is this. Am I crazy? I feel like this should be so obvious that we should not be funneling people to the front end. Okay. I'm gonna re chat and see if people think the same thing.

00:41:56
dirk_ickles: Frontend also implies distributed system

00:41:57
<transcript>: I started I did it through CLI apps, windows forms, same and barely front end and normal footprint income later through PHP. Very different than jumping. I react CLI for getting weather covers a lot exactly.

00:41:57
<transcript>: thank you

00:42:00
<transcript>: Thank you, DAX. I knew we'd be on the same page.

00:42:12
<transcript>: Front end also implies distributed system. Yeah, that's a great point. Like front end, when you're building from first, you kind of have to learn about this frontend back end thing. The thing that serves your front end.

00:42:32
<transcript>: Like a CLI is one little thing. It's all contained. Yeah. You might get data from other sources, but like, you don't have to think about how you're frontend is really served from something. And there might be a difference between that thing and other API's that you consume. Like, I just think front end is maybe the worst place to start.

00:42:41
<transcript>: I also think front end is maybe the hardest thing in development. Thank you so much for the followed Dewood and it's swirly, swarthy.

00:42:45
<transcript>: i don't know i have a problem with our default

00:42:45
<transcript>: de facto

00:42:47
<transcript>: De facto shove people into react.

00:42:47
<transcript>: as

00:42:59
<transcript>: As their intro to The Sealed. I just think it's like most it's one of the most challenging things in this field. As someone who's done stuff all over the stack. I mean, I've.

00:42:59
<transcript>: done

00:43:02
<transcript>: Done it all from, like.

00:43:04
<transcript>: Super weird.

00:43:04
<transcript>: back

00:43:07
<transcript>: Backend infrastructure, stuff.

00:43:07
<transcript>: to like

00:43:11
<transcript>: To like CLI and other tools like that.

00:43:11
<transcript>: to like

00:43:14
<transcript>: To like front end stuff.

00:43:19
<transcript>: Ml stuff. I've touched a lot of different things because that's kind of like what I like to do.

00:43:19
<transcript>: with technology

00:43:32
undefinednullknight: Funny, i have same opinon but on a be side

00:43:32
<transcript>: With technology. And I would say frontend is maybe the hardest thing for me to comprehend and Grock and like, stay on top of and that's where we send people to start. I don't think it's the right move. I think we should start moving people. So to answer your question, let's see.

00:43:32
<transcript>: twenty one

00:43:41
<transcript>: 21 blue. When should I move on to react? Should I learn JS first or jump into react? What have you learned? 1st 21 blue. I want to become full SEC. Moving to blockchain development later on in my career.

00:43:46
<transcript>: Sometimes forget my iphone. Makes calls. Just backing up here.

00:43:58
<transcript>: Kind of a school which takes one year and nine months. They will teach us HTML, CSS, and JS.

00:44:05
<transcript>: Takes a year in nine months. So that is that's a long time. That is.

00:44:05
<transcript>: that's like

00:44:08
<transcript>: That's like College. I guess that's not like a boot camp.

00:44:19
sticklemepickle: what is the little village setup behind you?

00:44:24
<transcript>: So 21. I guess my advice. I'm not saying you're on the wrong track. I think as an industry, we should expose more new people like you. You're two months in, we should expose you to more.

00:44:39
<transcript>: Varied types of work than just run and development because you might like really fall for just building stuff that doesn't have a front end, and you might want to do stuff entirely away from the front end. You might find out you want to be.

00:44:39
<transcript>: a

00:44:46
21_blu3: can you recommend me some courses? which i can do beside school?

00:44:49
<transcript>: A API developer or systems engineer infrastructure. Whatever you might want to do something that doesn't involve react because I sure do.

00:44:51
<transcript>: Okay.

00:44:54
21_blu3: like is there some youtube channels?

00:44:55
<transcript>: What's it doing? Am I still on fuzzy.

00:44:57
<transcript>: Is this so fuzzy.

00:44:57
<transcript>: yeah

00:44:57
jaystation3x: A lot of employers dreading the full stack dream though.

00:45:00
thdxr: come up with an idea and keep googling till you can build it

00:45:03
<transcript>: Yeah, they're still fuzzy. Okay, cuz. I gotta get a token. I'm gonna get an access token.

00:45:03
<transcript>: where

00:45:03
21_blu3: or udemy courses?

00:45:05
<transcript>: Where is that.

00:45:06
thdxr: better than any course

00:45:08
jaystation3x: *dreaming

00:45:10
<transcript>: Here it is.

00:45:10
<transcript>: confirm

00:45:16
<transcript>: Confirm my email. Let's not my token, but confirmed. Okay. Confirmed.

00:45:16
<transcript>: now

00:45:18
<transcript>: Now, where is my token.

00:45:23
<transcript>: Tasks, organizations, what.

00:45:25
<transcript>: Schwett.

00:45:25
<transcript>: new model

00:45:33
<transcript>: New model. New data set, new space settings. I bet it's in settings. Access tokens. New token. What's this token for.

00:45:33
<transcript>: google

00:45:35
<transcript>: Google code.

00:45:36
caasidev: heyup Adam!

00:45:38
<transcript>: We're gonna say right.

00:45:43
<transcript>: We're gonna give it, give it right. Access.

00:45:43
<transcript>: okay

00:45:48
<transcript>: Okay. I'm gonna paste this in here to my Colab board, and then I can come off Fuzzy, I think.

00:45:48
<transcript>: if i can avoid

00:45:50
<transcript>: If I can avoid.

00:45:54
<transcript>: I don't know. Leaking it somehow.

00:45:57
<transcript>: Layton's.

00:46:02
<transcript>: Leighton's invim cloak can't save me when I'm pacing stuff into.

00:46:02
<transcript>: these colour

00:46:06
<transcript>: These colour pages. Where do I? What.

00:46:12
<transcript>: There it is. Insert text here. Done.

00:46:12
<transcript>: let's

00:46:16
<transcript>: Let's log into hugging face, and then let's minimize this thing.

00:46:19
<transcript>: Can I minimize it.

00:46:24
<transcript>: How do I hide.

00:46:26
<transcript>: I hide the token.

00:46:30
21_blu3: @thdxr how do i come up with an idea? do i just find out what "people are struggling with"?

00:46:33
<transcript>: I want to collapse the cell.

00:46:38
<transcript>: I don't want to leave that token just there for the world, you know.

00:46:46
<transcript>: Thank you so much. 21 Blue for the follow.

00:46:56
<transcript>: I appreciate that sound. Real time goes fast when I enjoyed I enjoy my stay here. I enjoy your stay here too. Sandrial hugging face is a weird name.

00:46:56
<transcript>: i just saw that

00:46:58
<transcript>: I just saw that chat too.

00:46:58
<transcript>: funny

00:47:03
<transcript>: Funny I have same opinion but on.

00:47:03
<transcript>: back ends

00:47:14
<transcript>: Back ends. Oh, you think people shouldn't be pushed into the backend? Welcome to Chat undefined Null Knight and Stickle Me Pickle. Now, that's a fun name to say. What is the little village set up behind me? That is.

00:47:27
<transcript>: A Lego. Modular. Lego. Modular buildings. I've made a little street. I spent a lot of time lighting them. It. That is my background. Okay. I don't know how I can hide this thing.

00:47:28
<transcript>: Oh, wait.

00:47:35
<transcript>: Show code, add textile. I guess I'm just gonna have to, like.

00:47:38
<transcript>: Not scroll up here.

00:47:40
<transcript>: The odds.

00:47:40
<transcript>: i can pull that off

00:47:45
<transcript>: I can pull that off. What do we think? I'm gonna go off, Fuzzy, and we're gonna just.

00:47:48
<transcript>: Hope we're gonna hope.

00:47:48
<transcript>: actually

00:47:52
<transcript>: Actually found a way to not show the whole thing. Okay, I'm coming off fuzzy now.

00:47:57
jaystation3x: dev tools hide w/css?

00:47:57
<transcript>: You may see my screen.

00:48:02
<transcript>: Okay, install Transformers from precompiled wheel.

00:48:04
<transcript>: Sounds, legit.

00:48:04
<transcript>: just

00:48:07
<transcript>: Just install that thing.

00:48:11
thdxr: oh nooo python

00:48:15
<transcript>: Let's do it.

00:48:15
<transcript>: if i

00:48:22
<transcript>: If I find out Stroop I'm coming after you. If I find out, the TPU would have been like ten times faster. I'm gonna be upset.

00:48:22
<transcript>: i'm gonna

00:48:25
<transcript>: I'm gonna lose a bunch of time.

00:48:25
<transcript>: just kidding

00:48:33
<transcript>: Just kidding. But I would like to know if it's if it's gonna be a lot faster. See? I can. I can hide that cell. Why can't I hide the other cell.

00:48:33
<transcript>: okay

00:48:38
<transcript>: Okay if model weights should be saved directly in Google Drive takes around four to five gigs.

00:48:38
<transcript>: sure

00:48:39
stroopwafel26: My life hangs in the balance

00:48:40
<transcript>: Sure.

00:48:40
<transcript>: where else would

00:48:41
<transcript>: Where else would I save them.

00:48:41
<transcript>: yeah

00:48:43
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:48:43
<transcript>: name

00:48:45
<transcript>: Name path of the initial model.

00:48:48
<transcript>: I guess.

00:48:50
<transcript>: You tell me.

00:48:50
<transcript>: into the

00:48:56
<transcript>: Into the directory name to save the model at stable views and weights SKS sounds good.

00:48:59
<transcript>: Permits this notebook? Yes. Connect to do.

00:49:01
<transcript>: It.

00:49:06
thdxr: @21_blu3 build something you want

00:49:09
<transcript>: Notebook are kind of cool.

00:49:13
<transcript>: I'm kind of a fan. This is nice.

00:49:17
<transcript>: Okay mounted content drive weights will be saved at that.

00:49:17
<transcript>: sounds good

00:49:19
<transcript>: Sounds good.

00:49:24
thdxr: Build for yourself

00:49:30
<transcript>: Settings and Run now we are starting the training process. Use a table below to choose the best flags based on your memory and speed requirements tested on Tesla T for GPU.

00:49:30
<transcript>: okay

00:49:30
stroopwafel26: But yeah, all software you're using here are far too optimized for GPU's and work best with them, I wouldn't bet on a TPU

00:49:31
thdxr: building for others is expert mode

00:49:31
<transcript>: Okay.

00:49:31
<transcript>: so we're gonna have

00:49:34
<transcript>: So we're gonna have to tweak some stuff based on.

00:49:37
<transcript>: Based on our hardware.

00:49:43
<transcript>: Max Train steps.

00:49:47
<transcript>: Instance class or instance data class. Data.

00:49:54
<transcript>: Photo of a dog photo of SKS dog. Okay, we don't want to do a dog.

00:50:02
<transcript>: Upload your images by running this cell, or you can use the file manager on the left panel to upload to each instance. Data Dur.

00:50:02
<transcript>: it

00:50:03
<transcript>: It uploads, faster.

00:50:06
<transcript>: Specify the Weights directory. Okay.

00:50:11
<transcript>: How are we doing? Are we following all this? There's a dog.

00:50:13
<transcript>: He's cute.

00:50:20
stroopwafel26: oooh a corgi

00:50:20
<transcript>: Delete, diffuser and old weights only keep the C checkpoint to free up drive space.

00:50:23
<transcript>: Okay.

00:50:32
<transcript>: Let's see so we want to we gotta update this table.

00:50:39
<transcript>: Test it on Tesla T Four. We're running on an A 100. Now.

00:50:43
<transcript>: Fp 16 gradient accumulation steps.

00:50:51
<transcript>: I'm gonna Google.

00:50:54
<transcript>: Gonna Google things.

00:50:54
<transcript>: we

00:50:55
<transcript>: We're gonna Google.

00:50:59
<transcript>: Fp.

00:51:06
<transcript>: Dream booth.

00:51:08
<transcript>: Stable diffusion.

00:51:17
<transcript>: Hyperprems. What are we gonna call these flags.

00:51:25
<transcript>: For Rams for a 100.

00:51:27
<transcript>: I'll try this.

00:51:31
<transcript>: Dream dream booth.

00:51:36
<transcript>: Make sure to take advantage you know, want to take advantage of our hardware here.

00:51:41
<transcript>: Can you recommend me some courses which I can do Besides school.

00:51:41
<transcript>: i

00:51:48
<transcript>: I don't have any idea. I've not taken a lot of like what web development courses or any I guess.

00:51:48
<transcript>: youtube channel

00:51:57
<transcript>: Youtube channels. Yeah. I would say YouTube channels for somebody who's two months into their journey. And you do want to learn frontend like that's your thing. You want to stick with that.

00:52:01
<transcript>: A lot of employers dreading the Full Stack dream, though.

00:52:05
<transcript>: Kind of an idea. Oh, Jayce, here.

00:52:08
<transcript>: Dreading the full sector in you mean like.

00:52:10
<transcript>: They're dreading people.

00:52:15
<transcript>: Getting into full stack. So what, you mean, Jay.

00:52:19
21_blu3: i want to become a full-stack/blockchain

00:52:20
<transcript>: Come up with an ID and keep Google until you can build it. Yes.

00:52:23
<transcript>: Better than any course. Yes, it is.

00:52:23
<transcript>: caff

00:52:29
<transcript>: Caffeine? What's going on? Cassie. How do I come up with an idea? Do I just find out what people are struggling with.

00:52:32
thdxr: word of advice, ignore anything Blockchain related

00:52:40
<transcript>: I'm gonna keep reading and see if anyone answered that DevTools hide with CSS. Oh, good idea, Jay. I could have hidden the yeah, yeah, I think we got a good solution now I think I'm just not gonna scroll up again.

00:52:42
stroopwafel26: man, blockchain

00:52:42
<transcript>: Is that a good solution.

00:52:46
<transcript>: No Python. My life hangs in the balance.

00:52:51
<transcript>: Build something you want? Build for yourself but yeah, I'll suffer. I'm sorry. I'm reading literally all this.

00:52:52
shaaah: @thdxr why though?

00:52:53
stroopwafel26: too many thoughts

00:52:53
thdxr: build core skills don't bet on anything specific, I'm 10 years into my career and I'm just starting to make more specific bets

00:53:02
<transcript>: Also software you're using here far too often. Gpus and work best with them. Wouldn't bet on a TPU. Okay, cool. Strip knows things, so I'm sticking with it.

00:53:07
<transcript>: Building for others is Expert mode, although I will say DAX.

00:53:12
<transcript>: Tomo from 30 Seconds to Mars If anyone's followed his Web development journey.

00:53:14
<transcript>: It's.

00:53:14
<transcript>: worth to follow

00:53:25
<transcript>: Worth to follow. You find them on Twitter. If you're not following him. The guy oozes excitement and like early enthusiasm for this field, it is so fun to watch.

00:53:25
<transcript>: he makes

00:53:33
<transcript>: He makes me more excited about programming and software development because it's so fun to see through his eyes.

00:53:33
<transcript>: he's

00:53:36
itswarley_: Who?

00:53:37
<transcript>: He's very into it very passionate and just like bubbling with excitement.

00:53:51
<transcript>: He already has done Dax a project for somebody and it seems like that helped him kind of like have a real thing. He needed like somebody needed a website. And he helped this person when his friends, he built a website for them and it gave him like this whole thing to try and focus on and get done.

00:53:54
<transcript>: So it can work for some people I guess.

00:53:54
<transcript>: but maybe yeah maybe

00:53:56
<transcript>: But maybe yeah maybe expert mode.

00:53:56
<transcript>: want to become fulltech

00:53:58
<transcript>: Want to become fulltech blockchain.

00:54:05
<transcript>: Ignore anything. Blockchain. Thank you, DAX. Okay. I was gonna say, I don't know what to say because.

00:54:05
<transcript>: my first question

00:54:09
<transcript>: My first question is, like, Why blockchain? Why were you sold on blockchain.

00:54:20
<transcript>: Too many thoughts, build core skills. Don't bet on anything specific. That's great advice. I'm ten years in my career, and I'm just starting to make more specific bets.

00:54:25
<transcript>: Who? Oh, Sorry, Tomo. From 30 Seconds to Mars. Swirly.

00:54:25
<transcript>: tomo

00:54:26
<transcript>: Tomo.

00:54:28
<transcript>: Let me find them on Twitter.

00:54:30
<transcript>: Tomo.

00:54:34
<transcript>: Come up from Earth. There you go.

00:54:35
adamdotdev: https://twitter.com/tomofromearth

00:54:37
<transcript>: If you're.

00:54:37
<transcript>: a veteran

00:54:48
itswarley_: Thanks

00:54:50
shaaah: I work at a crypto exchange, So block chain is something that is highly paid

00:54:52
<transcript>: A veteran in this field. If you're new, just follow Tomo and you'll be excited. It's fun to watch him. He's very excited. Okay. Dream Beast using the eight bit Atom Optimizer from Bits and Bytes, along with X Farmers, while being two times faster.

00:55:03
<transcript>: I just want to Max these settings out. You know, I don't want to, like, leave hardware on the table. So when we train.

00:55:07
<transcript>: Train Batch Size FP 16.

00:55:10
<transcript>: Like, what am I looking at? Here.

00:55:17
<transcript>: Use the table below to choose the best flags based on your memories. Peter Grants oh, wait a wait at the table.

00:55:17
<transcript>: it's a table

00:55:18
<transcript>: It's a table.

00:55:20
<transcript>: Wait. What.

00:55:26
<transcript>: So like.

00:55:31
<transcript>: I want the settings to use 1579.

00:55:35
<transcript>: Or not, I want the highest speed.

00:55:35
<transcript>: this

00:55:37
<transcript>: This, what.

00:55:39
thdxr: I mostly meant if you're coming up with an idea, solving other people's problems is harder than solving your own

00:55:41
<transcript>: Test it on Tesla T for GPU.

00:55:41
<transcript>: add gra

00:55:45
<transcript>: Add Gradient checkpoint. Flag for around nine to G.

00:55:45
<transcript>: gb

00:55:50
<transcript>: Gbram remove Use eight bit atom flag for full precision.

00:55:53
<transcript>: Requires 16.

00:56:03
<transcript>: L 17. I guess we want the Max, right? Because we've got like 40 gigs to work with. Remove train text, encoder flag to reduce memory usage. Further, I don't want to do that.

00:56:10
<transcript>: So.

00:56:12
21_blu3: @shaaah is front-end a good start? or do you have some other path for me?

00:56:18
<transcript>: Remove use eight bit atom. So we don't want eight bits atom. So where are these flags? Let's see.

00:56:21
<transcript>: Here.

00:56:26
<transcript>: Are they here? Yeah. So I want to remove this one.

00:56:30
<transcript>: I don't want to use eight bit atom. Right.

00:56:30
<transcript>: i want to

00:56:37
<transcript>: I want to use the more memory thing because we have more memory add gradient checkboning flag for around nine two.

00:56:42
<transcript>: I don't need to do that.

00:56:42
<transcript>: is it

00:56:44
<transcript>: Is it faster.

00:56:48
<transcript>: Okay. We don't want that. We don't want use a bit atom.

00:56:53
<transcript>: Although it sounds like it may be slower.

00:56:56
<transcript>: But we want full precision.

00:57:00
<transcript>: With gradient checkpointing.

00:57:00
<transcript>: okay

00:57:07
<transcript>: Okay. And then remove train text encoder to remove. We don't want to do that. Okay. So we're sticking with these flags, I guess.

00:57:10
<transcript>: And then we need to.

00:57:10
<transcript>: add multip

00:57:14
<transcript>: Add multiple constants here. Try Tweaking Max train sets accordingly.

00:57:17
stroopwafel26: 8 bit adam sounds like a new emote

00:57:18
<transcript>: Max train steps. What.

00:57:24
<transcript>: 's a new email.

00:57:25
shaaah: @shaaah Front end is a great path, the pay for Front end in most companies are crazy

00:57:34
<transcript>: Mostly. Man, if you're coming up with an idea, solving a other people's problems is harder than solving around. Yeah, totally.

00:57:34
<transcript>: i got you

00:57:35
<transcript>: I got you.

00:57:47
<transcript>: Okay.

00:57:54
<transcript>: Concepts list. So it says you can also add multiple concepts here.

00:57:58
<transcript>: So instance prompt clap.

00:57:58
<transcript>: class prompt

00:58:04
<transcript>: Class prompt instance data directory, class, data directory. And they're saying, I could add more.

00:58:08
<transcript>: Photo of Ukj person.

00:58:12
<transcript>: Instance and then class photo of a person.

00:58:19
<transcript>: So I do. I do want to do this. I want to uncomment these. Right.

00:58:27
<transcript>: Okay. So we're gonna add.

00:58:32
<transcript>: Photo of a dog I don't I guess I don't need photo of a dog.

00:58:36
<transcript>: What is the Ukj for.

00:58:36
<transcript>: i don't really

00:58:39
<transcript>: I don't really understand that, but.

00:58:50
<transcript>: I guess just a token that's unique that allows us. Yeah, yeah, it's just a unique token that allows us to tie.

00:58:50
<transcript>: someone's like

00:58:52
<transcript>: Someone's likeness.

00:58:52
<transcript>: to something

00:58:54
<transcript>: To something in text.

00:59:00
<transcript>: Okay photo of a person instance from photo of Ukj person.

00:59:07
<transcript>: So we're gonna have data of just people. And we're gonna have data of that person.

00:59:07
<transcript>: but

00:59:10
<transcript>: But I don't want to do this right.

00:59:13
<transcript>: I don't want to do the dog.

00:59:15
<transcript>: Okay.

00:59:20
<transcript>: Regularization images class data Dur Yep.

00:59:20
<transcript>: concerns

00:59:22
<transcript>: Concerns regularization images.

00:59:29
<transcript>: With Open Concepts List JSON, which is.

00:59:30
<transcript>: That.

00:59:35
<transcript>: Okay. So let's run it.

00:59:42
<transcript>: That was quick upload your images by running this cell or you can use the file manager here.

00:59:46
<transcript>: With the file manager. Yeah.

00:59:46
<transcript>: file and

00:59:50
<transcript>: File Andrew on the left panel. Drag and drop to each instance data durer.

00:59:50
<transcript>: so under

00:59:53
<transcript>: So under data. Let's see.

00:59:53
<transcript>: content data

00:59:54
<transcript>: Content, data.

00:59:57
<transcript>: Ukj.

01:00:00
<transcript>: Right.

01:00:05
<transcript>: Well, I don't know.

01:00:12
<transcript>: I don't know.

01:00:12
<transcript>: is this it

01:00:14
<transcript>: Is this. It's not content.

01:00:14
<transcript>: is that

01:00:16
<transcript>: Is that it's content the root.

01:00:20
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. Okay. Content. Here we go.

01:00:20
<transcript>: content data

<transcript>: We'll go with this one.

01:17:38
<transcript>: Yep.

01:17:46
<transcript>: We got too many black and whites that's got problem.

01:17:50
<transcript>: Oh, I don't want other people's faces, though.

01:17:56
<transcript>: Like that maybe.

01:17:57
<transcript>: It's under.

01:17:57
<transcript>: face

01:17:59
<transcript>: Face in the model.

01:18:05
<transcript>: We're gonna do away with this one.

01:18:11
<transcript>: Just can't have too many Oops can't have too many.

01:18:15
<transcript>: Black and whites. I've already got Oof they're half black and white right now.

01:18:26
<transcript>: We could use this one if it's if it's good, if it's big.

01:18:30
<transcript>: That's it's not great.

01:18:35
<transcript>: That's probably okay.

01:18:40
<transcript>: Probably. Okay.

01:18:47
<transcript>: All right.

01:18:54
<transcript>: Got that one.

01:18:54
<transcript>: here's

01:19:00
<transcript>: Here's one. If it's big enough, it's a full body shot. 340 pixels.

01:19:02
<transcript>: I don't like it.

01:19:02
<transcript>: we did

01:19:10
<transcript>: We did that that model yesterday. It was kind of awful. And I think it's largely because those images were so small.

01:19:10
<transcript>: and so a lot of

01:19:13
<transcript>: And so a lot of our results were really pixelated.

01:19:13
<transcript>: what's wrong

01:19:16
<transcript>: What's wrong? What's wrong? Here? Oh, it's got a new.

01:19:16
<transcript>: open image

01:19:20
<transcript>: Open image and new Tab. It's gonna be too small. Yeah.

01:19:20
<transcript>: i need that

01:19:23
<transcript>: I need that image, though. That's a good one of his face.

01:19:23
<transcript>: here's

01:19:25
<transcript>: Here's another one.

01:19:31
<transcript>: Some probably not big enough.

01:19:34
<transcript>: It acts like it's Loading. Still, though.

01:19:47
<transcript>: There we go. That one's big.

01:19:57
<transcript>: That's last year's. Next cough right if I recall I'm such a fanboy look at me knowing stuff about.

01:19:57
<transcript>: next js

01:19:58
<transcript>: Next JS.

01:20:04
schrew: Gm adam!

01:20:05
<transcript>: Five.

01:20:12
<transcript>: Nobody's created a rash? G.

01:20:13
<transcript>: gable

01:20:13
<transcript>: gable diffusion

01:20:17
thdxr: I'm anti vercel, I just always want the frontrunner to die

01:20:18
<transcript>: Gable diffusion model, right? I'm not doing this when it's already been done.

01:20:18
<transcript>: vincent

01:20:20
<transcript>: Vincent didn't do this, did he.

01:20:22
<transcript>: Find out.

01:20:27
thdxr: we get it people love you!

01:20:30
<transcript>: Somebody go to his Twitter and just tell me he hasn't already. He doesn't already have a model, right.

01:20:35
<transcript>: Too small.

01:20:42
<transcript>: So many black and white.

01:20:48
<transcript>: Good morning. Shrew.

01:20:55
<transcript>: Can you use 20 stills from a video? Maybe as long as they're like.

01:20:55
<transcript>: high enough

01:21:00
<transcript>: High enough. I guess I'm antivercelle. I just always want the frontrunner to die.

01:21:02
<transcript>: We get it. People love you.

01:21:11
<transcript>: There is something kind of awesome offputting about people getting really into something, isn't there? Like when everyone's really into something, there's something about that that just kind of like.

01:21:14
<transcript>: Makes you want to not be into it, doesn't it.

01:21:21
<transcript>: What's that say about Stacks? Maybe other people don't feel that way. Maybe it's just us.

01:21:24
<transcript>: Maybe we're awful people.

01:21:25
thdxr: yeah that's why I'll stop using solidjs soon

01:21:29
<transcript>: Okay.

01:21:29
<transcript>: so just

01:21:32
<transcript>: So just two black and Whites so far.

01:21:37
<transcript>: Feel like this is pretty good so far we're doing okay.

01:21:37
<transcript>: let's get some more

01:21:38
<transcript>: Let's get some more.

01:21:45
<transcript>: Oh, Here's.

01:21:52
<transcript>: Finally, that photo. But large 400. Is that good enough.

01:21:52
<transcript>: oh

01:21:53
<transcript>: Oh, wait.

01:21:56
<transcript>: Is this one bigger? No.

01:22:02
<transcript>: 600.

01:22:02
<transcript>: we'll take

01:22:04
<transcript>: We'll take it.

01:22:12
<transcript>: Cool.

01:22:12
schrew: Normally i prefer using things that people like 🤷 but i do have some anti-establishment streaks in me

01:22:21
<transcript>: Feeling good about this. This model is gonna be solid. I'm telling you, we're gonna play with the Hyper proameters.

01:22:25
<transcript>: We're gonna tune it, we're gonna make the best.

01:22:31
<transcript>: Rosh G. Stylase Portraits the Internet has ever seen.

01:22:34
<transcript>: All on Next JS. Coffee.

01:22:36
<transcript>: I'm Luke.

01:22:36
<transcript>: about what

01:22:40
<transcript>: About what they're gonna announce, aren't you, DAX? You love next, Jess. Right.

01:22:44
<transcript>: Next doesn't use next year.

01:22:50
<transcript>: That's why he'll stop using SAUJ soon. Oh, no, you can't have nice things.

01:22:53
stroopwafel26: it's gonna be a hybrid between non-corp and corp rauchg

01:22:54
<transcript>: Normally I prefer using things that people like, but I do have some anti establishment streaks in me.

01:23:00
thdxr: I'll use NextJS when people stop using it

01:23:03
<transcript>: Between non Corp and core prostitute. Yeah, we're getting a mix of all of it. That's another black and white one.

01:23:06
<transcript>: We'll see if we can't find something better.

01:23:12
<transcript>: If I start running, like if I get into a situation where I've got more images than I need.

01:23:13
<transcript>: Then.

01:23:17
<transcript>: That's a good problem to have, but I don't think I'm going to.

01:23:21
<transcript>: Small.

01:23:30
<transcript>: Yeah might just have to take some frames from a video if I start running out of.

01:23:32
<transcript>: That's gonna be tiny, right.

01:23:37
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:23:48
<transcript>: I will say my problem, my problem with Versailles when I say that.

01:23:48
<transcript>: they're like apple

01:23:49
<transcript>: They're like Apple.

01:23:51
<transcript>: My problem is that.

01:23:56
<transcript>: And I guess like.

01:23:59
<transcript>: What am I looking for.

01:24:03
cowfacedude99: I guess finding pictures is the bigger problem LUL

01:24:05
<transcript>: I guess the way there's part of that is not a compliment, like they're also.

01:24:05
<transcript>: polished

01:24:11
<transcript>: Polished. Does anyone agree with this? I think they're almost too polished. Like they lack a bit of personality.

01:24:11
<transcript>: i think

01:24:15
thdxr: Leerob was replaced by a robot months ago

01:24:30
<transcript>: I think Apple, Apple's very polished. I think there's some personality there, though, like they're advertising in particular. Like they're color scheme, like the way they do photography. Like there's some personality, maybe. Like Apple talks. Like when they're up on stage, it's too polished for me. It's not enough personality. But I think Versell.

01:24:30
<transcript>: even like

01:24:38
<transcript>: Even like their advertising black and white monochrome. Like everything is sort of stripped. I think of relatability.

01:24:42
<transcript>: This is my little point. I don't have look. What do I know.

01:24:42
<transcript>: what i know

01:24:46
thdxr: agree about lack of personality

01:24:50
<transcript>: What I know I know nothing, but I think I'm off put a little bit by the Polish. I think they're devoring.

01:24:52
<transcript>: Could like be a little more.

01:24:53
thdxr: what are they hiding!?

01:24:58
<transcript>: There could be a little more personality. There. Is that just me. Does anyone else feel that way.

01:24:58
laytanl_: With nextjs being open source, how are new announcements not known before?

01:25:02
stroopwafel26: hot take: comparing anything to apple is not a good look because apple hasn't been making great software as of late

01:25:04
<transcript>: I wasn't gonna name names next.

01:25:06
<transcript>: But Yeah.

01:25:08
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:25:11
<transcript>: When people stop using it.

01:25:18
<transcript>: I guess finding pictures is the bigger problem. Yeah, exactly. That's the hard part about.

01:25:20
<transcript>: Ai.

01:25:31
<transcript>: What are they hiding? Yeah, that's the other thing. When you don't have any personality, I assume you have strong feelings that you're not sharing latency here with next just being open source. How are new announcements? Not knowing before.

01:25:31
<transcript>: i think

01:25:42
<transcript>: I think there's some tea leaves. I think there's some pull requests you can pick up on even just like RFC's. Then everyone gets hyped about the layouts. Rsc. I'm sure it's gonna be like merge as part of the next day. 13. That's what they're not like. That'll be part of it.

01:25:42
<transcript>: but

01:25:47
schrew: My anti-establishment streak is showing - I actively try and resist forming opinions about companies through their marketing

01:25:53
<transcript>: But yeah, I think they're they do a good job with the secrecy. They're applelike in that way, too. I think there will be some things that they don't they don't merge or they don't put out their intel after.

01:25:53
<transcript>: hotte comparing

01:26:00
<transcript>: Hotte comparing anything to Apple is not good luck because Apple hasn't been making great software as of late. I've never liked Apple cider.

01:26:04
<transcript>: Best hardware maker in the world.

01:26:04
<transcript>: buy a long shot

01:26:06
<transcript>: Buy a long shot there's no one close.

01:26:06
<transcript>: to apple hardware

01:26:07
<transcript>: To Apple hardware.

01:26:07
<transcript>: their software

01:26:09
<transcript>: Their software.

01:26:16
<transcript>: Mixed bag, lot of it really awful. I mean, we've got things like itunes, like look at the hidden history of Apple software.

01:26:16
<transcript>: i'm sure they're gonna

01:26:18
stroopwafel26: not loving apple software club?

01:26:18
<transcript>: I'm sure they're gonna better and like.

01:26:26
thdxr: dog walk time I'll be back in an hour will try to hang out for the watch party

01:26:26
<transcript>: There's great engineers, I'm sure working there. But they don't have a good track record with software. And the way that they do with hardware.

01:26:26
<transcript>: always

01:26:27
fredkisss: @laytanl_ They can work on pull requests on private repos.

01:26:31
<transcript>: Always felt that way. We're the big photos of Rosh G.

01:26:34
<transcript>: I can use this one. I don't think it's very good.

01:26:34
<transcript>: it might

01:26:37
<transcript>: It might be a first candidate to get removed.

01:26:37
<transcript>: but it is

01:26:40
<transcript>: But it is a full body. And we're supposed to have some full bodies.

01:26:44
<transcript>: I don't know if this is too many full bodies.

01:26:58
laytanl_: ah makes sense

01:27:00
<transcript>: And I wasn't even speaking to Guillermo. I think your most personality.

01:27:06
<transcript>: Like, I think it comes through that's just his personality. I think their devil team in particular, though.

01:27:06
<transcript>: just too much

01:27:09
<transcript>: Just too much Polish. It's less than.

01:27:09
<transcript>: light

01:27:11
<transcript>: Lighten up on the Polish, you know.

01:27:11
<transcript>: it's okay

01:27:13
<transcript>: It's okay to be people.

01:27:16
<transcript>: Actual human beings.

01:27:27
<transcript>: Is that too terrible? It has glasses. I think that's not gonna work.

01:27:28
fredkisss: DevRel team... lee ?

01:27:32
<transcript>: Are we are we done design all the photos we can come up with it might be.

01:27:40
<transcript>: Might be all the photos that are large enough.

01:27:47
<transcript>: I could just open up a video. If we don't get a good result, we could just like, how many is this.

01:27:47
<transcript>: one

01:27:52
<transcript>: 1678, 910 eleven? Oh, let's at least get twelve.

01:27:52
<transcript>: i was going for

01:27:54
<transcript>: I was going for 24.

01:27:58
<transcript>: Fred.

01:27:58
<transcript>: fred kiss

01:28:02
<transcript>: Fred Kiss. Named names. Listen, people, I'm not trying to name names.

01:28:02
<transcript>: dax and

01:28:04
<transcript>: Dax and Fred are just coming out with it.

01:28:08
<transcript>: People on their team. I think.

01:28:12
<transcript>: Devrell front is like.

01:28:12
<transcript>: it's

01:28:15
<transcript>: It's too good. It's too shy.

01:28:15
<transcript>: you

01:28:19
<transcript>: You got a rough up those edges a little bit. You gotta be.

01:28:19
<transcript>: not like

01:28:20
<transcript>: Not like.

01:28:20
<transcript>: say things

01:28:26
<transcript>: Say things in our true or be inflammatory or make. I'm not saying any of that. I'm just saying, like literally.

01:28:29
<transcript>: Show some humanity and personality.

01:28:32
fredkisss: Is vercel VC backed ?

01:28:36
<transcript>: And I think if you as a company, if you decide we're gonna be so polished? Everything's gonna be so good.

01:28:36
<transcript>: you start

01:28:38
<transcript>: You start to lose.

01:28:38
<transcript>: that

01:28:41
<transcript>: That personality.

01:28:43
<transcript>: I don't know.

01:28:43
schrew: You gotta do some failed live-coding Kappa

01:28:45
<transcript>: Is Versal VC backed.

01:28:53
<transcript>: I mean, they've raised, like, how much is Versaille raised? Like a hundred million. More. More than that.

01:28:57
<transcript>: Versaille fundraising. They've raised a lot of money.

01:28:57
<transcript>: they raised

01:29:07
<transcript>: They raised $150,000,000 D. $102,000,000 C. I mean, they've got a war chest. I don't know what their burn looks like.

01:29:10
<transcript>: They've hired some heavy hitters.

01:29:10
<transcript>: anyway

01:29:13
<transcript>: Anyway, now I'm just talking about stuff I don't know anything about.

01:29:19
<transcript>: I gotta do some failed live coating. There you go. Tarnish that Polish a little bit.

01:29:19
<transcript>: just like scuff

<transcript>: Just like scuff it up.

01:34:18
<transcript>: They're good at it.

01:34:18
<transcript>: they just

01:34:24
<transcript>: They just need to sprinkle in a little more humanity. A little more.

01:34:29
<transcript>: Personality. That's my recommendation. Take it or leave it.

01:34:34
<transcript>: Take it or leave it.

01:34:34

01:34:48
<transcript>: oh i guess if

01:35:04
<transcript>: Oh, I guess if I do two more. No. Is that 18. Does that count? That right. Six times. Two is twelve. Plus 1234 is 16. I was close. So I'd have to do four more to get 20. I don't want to do frames from these videos. It's two minutes too much. Same close.

01:35:07
<transcript>: See wearing anything different in this? No.

01:35:07
<transcript>: that's

01:35:10
<transcript>: That's a good one, though.

01:35:17
stroopwafel26: We need a "Craig Federighi running towards something" moment from Vercel, like in that Apple keynote recently

01:35:21
<transcript>: Oh, I didn't take a big enough screenshot.

01:35:36
<transcript>: Okay.

01:35:39
<transcript>: Look.

01:35:42
<transcript>: They don't need to take my advice.

01:35:42
<transcript>: gueram

01:35:44
<transcript>: Gueramos doing just fine.

01:35:44
<transcript>: games

01:35:47
<transcript>: Games Rays like $300 million.

01:35:51
fredkisss: @stroopwafel26 That would be so COOL LUL

01:35:52
<transcript>: So he's doing just fine with his Devrel team personality or not.

01:35:52
<transcript>: doesn't need

01:35:54
<transcript>: Doesn't need my help.

01:36:03
<transcript>: I'm okay, let's do one more one more search. See if there's any more videos.

01:36:14
<transcript>: Of him at this conference.

01:36:18
<transcript>: Not great lighting.

01:36:28
<transcript>: Don't think so.

01:36:35
<transcript>: Who is this next year? Yeah, it's Gearmo.

01:36:37
<transcript>: We need a crap.

01:36:43
<transcript>: Guy running towards something moment from Versaille. Like in that Apple keynote.

01:36:43
<transcript>: yeah

01:36:48
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm very curious. I'm just so excited to watch their keynote today.

01:36:58
<transcript>: Let's see how good the quality is on this one. I do feel like I could use a few more photos, but.

01:37:05
<transcript>: Do some people just have less of a personality? Is that a thing.

01:37:06
kociqq: I love Guillermo, look how he used to be compared to now https://youtu.be/wxDBF3OOaRA?t=141 ayezeeSAD

01:37:08
<transcript>: Is it possible that some people just.

01:37:08
<transcript>: don't

01:37:12
<transcript>: Don't have as much of the personality.

01:37:16
<transcript>: Are we a lot of the certain measure of personality. Is that a thing.

01:37:16
<transcript>: i'm not trying to be

01:37:19
<transcript>: I'm not trying to be offensive. Honest question.

01:37:22
<transcript>: Is it popsicle.

01:37:24
fredkisss: I think his noun is pronounced Gui-chermo right... ?

01:37:26
<transcript>: That it's not a corporate culture.

01:37:26
<transcript>: or a

01:37:30
<transcript>: Or a company culture thing ever sell, but it's actually people.

01:37:30
<transcript>: with

01:37:32
<transcript>: With a little bit less.

01:37:32
<transcript>: personality

01:37:36
<transcript>: Personality, and that's not meant to be mean. I'm not trying to like.

01:37:36
<transcript>: dishonor

01:37:41
<transcript>: Dishonor, honest question. Maybe it's not like they're trying to be that way.

01:37:41
<transcript>: maybe we just

01:37:44
<transcript>: Maybe we just don't all have the same amount of personality.

01:37:47
<transcript>: I don't know.

01:37:51
<transcript>: Export 17 layers as PNG. Here we go.

01:37:54
<transcript>: We did it, everybody.

01:38:01
<transcript>: We've got some training data. We're gonna train this model on Guillermo's face. Pretty pumped.

01:38:15
<transcript>: All Right. Here we go.

01:38:19
<transcript>: Well, I say, here we go, like it's gonna just magically be done as soon as I click that button.

01:38:19
<transcript>: it's like

01:38:21
<transcript>: It's like the next step is done.

01:38:21
<transcript>: okay

01:38:23
<transcript>: Okay.

01:38:29
<transcript>: I don't need to run this step, do I? No, I don't need to. I can run this step.

01:38:32
<transcript>: And what's this doing? This is training.

01:38:32
<transcript>: this training

01:38:34
<transcript>: This training.

01:38:38
<transcript>: I think it's doing it.

01:38:47
<transcript>: Number processes, number of machines. I wonder if we couldn't do this faster if we just change some params sample batch size.

01:38:48
fredkisss: The amount of tabs open on your browser stresses me out

01:38:51
<transcript>: Number of class images that's not accurate.

01:38:53
<transcript>: Is it.

01:38:53
nexxeln: is this using tensorflow

01:38:55
<transcript>: Resolution 512.

01:39:00
<transcript>: We're gonna play with these things. If the model's bad, we'll play with these things, right.

01:39:04
<transcript>: Oh my.

01:39:08
<transcript>: Hang on.

01:39:30
<transcript>: It occurs to me.

01:39:36
<transcript>: There will be no Rick rolling me today.

01:39:42
<transcript>: Okay, I've I've disabled Rick roll.

01:39:49
<transcript>: That was. That was close. I just. I'm using Chrome here. I didn't want. I didn't want you all. Rick rolling me. That would make me feel bad.

01:39:53
<transcript>: Exactly.

01:39:57
<transcript>: Oh, my thing here am I wrong.

01:40:07
<transcript>: Am I saying his name wrong? This is not using TensorFlow. I think it's pietorch. This is stability. It's stable. Diffusion.

01:40:09
<transcript>: And.

01:40:18
<transcript>: Dream booth. And while this is starting, I don't know how far we are. What did I do on number of steps.

01:40:18
<transcript>: max

01:40:23
nexxeln: pytorch is nice

01:40:24
<transcript>: Max train sets 800. That's not very many. I should have probably done more steps. We'll play with it. That'll be a short.

01:40:24
<transcript>: training

01:40:28
<transcript>: Training should get done here pretty quick. I do need a quick break.

01:40:31
<transcript>: And I'll be right back.

01:40:37
stroopwafel26: love pytorch

01:40:41
charliec97: I'm mean, if he is spanish yes, if he is from latin america no

01:40:46
fredkisss: I've heard it pronounced like that on recent keynotes

01:52:56
<transcript>: Still here has everybody done.

01:52:58
<transcript>: We are at.

01:53:01
<transcript>: Only like 3 hours.

01:53:01
<transcript>: less than three

01:53:05
<transcript>: Less than 3 hours till next year's cost starts it's pretty excited.

01:53:05
<transcript>: going

01:53:10
<transcript>: Going to watch it here together. Anybody who'd like to watch it with me.

01:53:10
<transcript>: i think

01:53:12
<transcript>: I think for the follow.

01:53:12
<transcript>: mar

01:53:17
kociqq: excited ayezeePoggers

01:53:17
<transcript>: Marinda? Oh, Omar, Miranda, Omar, Miranda.

01:53:19
<transcript>: I got you.

01:53:19
<transcript>: excited

01:53:24
eddiethead1: Hi, whats stabledifusion?

01:53:26
<transcript>: Excited. I'm so pump. Actually, a 13. Did I mention the docs? They're not public, but they're so good.

01:53:30
kociqq: check out the video I posted, even tj is there

01:53:32
kociqq: such a rare video

01:53:34
<transcript>: What's stable diffusion. It is. This thing. Is. It done. It's done. We trained.

01:53:34
<transcript>: so stable

01:53:36
<transcript>: So stable fusion is.

01:53:36
<transcript>: like generate image

01:53:39
<transcript>: Like generate image from text prompts.

01:53:41
<transcript>: Okay.

01:53:42
fredkisss: Wait NextJS 13 ?

01:53:44
<transcript>: And dream booth.

01:53:48
<transcript>: Dream booth is like.

01:54:03
<transcript>: Train a model more specifically to take something's likeness and put it into different contexts. So take a person train a model to, like, figure out what a person looks like and then render them in lots of different settings. Like that person.

01:54:03
<transcript>: in the mountain

01:54:07
<transcript>: In the mountain looking at a sunset or that person.

01:54:07
<transcript>: as

01:54:13
<transcript>: As a Monet painting or that person in Fortnite, that kind of a thing.

01:54:16
<transcript>: Specify the Weights directory to use.

01:54:18
<transcript>: Blank for latest.

01:54:20
<transcript>: Okay.

01:54:27
<transcript>: There's our latest converter weights to checkpoint to use in web UIs like automatic.

01:54:27
<transcript>: run

01:54:29
<transcript>: Run conversion.

01:54:31
<transcript>: Takes half the space.

01:54:36
<transcript>: I don't know. Do we want to convert to FP 616? Maybe not.

01:54:44
<transcript>: Let's not let's go with double the space. Sounds like more better.

01:54:50
<transcript>: Next year. 13. Yes.

01:54:58
<transcript>: Yes. That's what they're I mean, they're announcing it today, right? Even TJ's there. What video did you post.

01:55:02
<transcript>: Did you post it in my channel here. Oh, you did.

01:55:06
<transcript>: Let's see this.

01:55:09
texoport: half precision could make training faster

01:55:13
texoport: fp16, I mean

01:55:13
<transcript>: Did it. Do it. Run conversion. Okay, we saved it. Here. Model checkpoint.

01:55:13
<transcript>: so

01:55:16
<transcript>: So I'm going to open that up, that video.

01:55:16
<transcript>: oh no

01:55:18
<transcript>: Oh no.

01:55:21
<transcript>: Let's.

01:55:26
<transcript>: In this video.

01:55:26
<transcript>: there's near mo

01:55:28
<transcript>: There's near Mo.

01:55:30
<transcript>: molly

01:55:31
<transcript>: Molly.

01:55:33
<transcript>: Conf, Argentina, 2012.

01:55:33
<transcript>: while two thousand and twelve

01:55:36
<transcript>: While 2012 ten years ago.

01:55:36
<transcript>: where's

01:55:37
<transcript>: Where's? Tiege.

01:55:45
<transcript>: Where is Tiege.

01:55:48
<transcript>: Wait.

01:55:48
<transcript>: tj went to

01:55:51
<transcript>: Tj went to JS. Commf in Argentina.

01:55:54
<transcript>: It sounds so not Tiege.

01:56:03
<transcript>: Half precision could make training faster. Fp 16. Thank you. Tech support. That's helpful.

01:56:05
<transcript>: Wait.

01:56:08
<transcript>: Who's this guy.

01:56:08
<transcript>: tj

01:56:09
kociqq: uh I meant TJ Holowaychuk

01:56:13
<transcript>: Tj. Hollowaychuck don't know that person. Wait. Creative Express. Oh, okay.

01:56:19
<transcript>: Where is Tiege? I need I need to teach siding.

01:56:19
<transcript>: before i can move on

01:56:20
<transcript>: Before I can move on.

01:56:21
kociqq: not teej

01:56:25
stroopwafel26: dat haircut tho

01:56:29
<transcript>: Where is he? Is he in this frame.

01:56:33
<transcript>: Oh, man.

01:56:36
<transcript>: If I could do teas, we can move on.

01:56:38
<transcript>: You're telling me teaches in this video.

01:56:38
<transcript>: oh not

01:56:41
<transcript>: Oh, not peace. Oh, I'm sorry.

01:56:41
<transcript>: tj

01:56:44
<transcript>: Tj I got ya.

01:56:44
<transcript>: why did i

01:56:46
<transcript>: Why did I think tee.

01:56:48
<transcript>: Did I read.

01:56:49
fredkisss: I don't know why but this in this year 2022 everything seems so long ago, like 2016 for ex was 8 YEARS ago

01:56:56
<transcript>: Even TJ. You said TJ. And I thought, yeah, I'm sorry.

01:56:56
<transcript>: i got you

01:56:58
<transcript>: I got you. Okay.

01:57:08
<transcript>: That's done. And now inference. So we're gonna let's see, where do we put in the prompt.

01:57:11
<transcript>: Random seed here.

01:57:11
<transcript>: for reproduc

01:57:13
<transcript>: For reproducibility.

01:57:16
kociqq: true

01:57:20
kociqq: we are getting old ayezeeSAD

01:57:20
<transcript>: So let's do this. What am I looking at here? Beta, start, beta, end.

01:57:23
<transcript>: Set Alpha to one.

01:57:26
<transcript>: We're just gonna run this code.

01:57:30
<transcript>: I don't know if I'm supposed to change anything.

01:57:39
<transcript>: Cash for modifiles has been updated. Migrating your old cache. This is a one time only operation. You can interrupt this and resume the migration later.

01:57:42
texoport: what GPU do you have on now?

01:57:43
stroopwafel26: interfence! we learning

01:57:43
<transcript>: Okay.

01:57:47
stroopwafel26: inference

01:57:50
<transcript>: So then we're gonna do prompts down here. We're gonna do gear Mo in a bucket.

01:57:52
stroopwafel26: hard word for me

01:57:54
<transcript>: Sorry. Okay, so random seed here.

01:57:54
<transcript>: let's do it

01:57:55
<transcript>: Let's do it.

01:58:02
<transcript>: And run for Jim Generated images. Negative prompt? What is a negative prompt.

01:58:07
<transcript>: Here we go photo of a.

01:58:07
<transcript>: oh what happened

01:58:08
<transcript>: Oh, what happened.

01:58:12
<transcript>: You.

01:58:12
<transcript>: kj

01:58:13
<transcript>: Kj.

01:58:15
<transcript>: Person.

01:58:15
<transcript>: and i'm

01:58:17
<transcript>: And I'm bucket.

01:58:17
<transcript>: why not

01:58:18
<transcript>: Why not.

01:58:21
<transcript>: Scale number of inference steps.

01:58:21
<transcript>: okay

01:58:22
<transcript>: Okay.

01:58:29
<transcript>: I'm going to Bucket. Let's see how good is our model. People.

01:58:30
charliec97: @texoport The script is running on google cloud I think, but adam is runnning a M1 ultra

01:58:31
<transcript>: Is it terrible.

01:58:31
<transcript>: we may have to go

01:58:34
<transcript>: We may have to go back to the drawing board. We'll see.

01:58:39
<transcript>: We learning all my word, that's first one.

01:58:39
<transcript>: wasn't bad

01:58:41
<transcript>: Wasn't bad. Where is it.

01:58:48
<transcript>: Is he in a bucket, though I don't know Where's the bucket.

01:58:49
kociqq: damn

01:58:53
<transcript>: This is too funny.

01:58:53
<transcript>: run

01:58:56
<transcript>: Run gradio UI for generating images.

01:59:03
<transcript>: Delete diffuser. Okay, so the model's not bad. It's not.

01:59:03
<transcript>: great

01:59:04
<transcript>: Great.

01:59:04
<transcript>: but

01:59:06
kociqq: the last one is almost it

01:59:08
<transcript>: But it's not bad. Let's try.

01:59:08
<transcript>: a photo of

01:59:08
stroopwafel26: those colab+ instances are SO fast wow

01:59:12
<transcript>: A photo of Ukj person.

01:59:15
<transcript>: In Game of Thrones.

01:59:18
<transcript>: Okay.

01:59:20
<transcript>: Try that.

01:59:23
fredkisss: What is UKJ ?

01:59:29
<transcript>: And I got launch one of these UIs, so start playing with model. I just I think we're gonna need to tweak the model. I don't think it's gonna be good enough.

01:59:34
<transcript>: Yeah, it's not quite good enough. Like.

01:59:34
<transcript>: this

01:59:37
<transcript>: This. It really makes me think that's Germa, you know.

01:59:41
<transcript>: Still a little off.

01:59:43
<transcript>: But one will make it better.

01:59:46
<transcript>: We'll make it better.

01:59:54
<transcript>: We can always download this checkpoint and play with these other tools. Let's try.

02:00:01
<transcript>: Do we want to try and make model better? Do we think it's our images.

02:00:03
<transcript>: Do we think.

02:00:03
<transcript>: what

02:00:09
<transcript>: What GPU do you have on now? This is the premium GPU on Google Co lab.

02:00:13
<transcript>: Using the premium.

02:00:18
<transcript>: Fred. I totally agree. I.

02:00:23
<transcript>: 2022 hearing that 2016 was eight years ago. That blows my mind we are getting old.

02:00:24
texoport: You can do !nvidia-smi to know what it is

02:00:33
<transcript>: Half was almost. It collapsed. Instances are so fast. Yeah. This went pretty fast.

02:00:33
<transcript>: uk

02:00:42
iamwhiteknife: !nvidia-smi

02:00:48
<transcript>: Ukj is just like a unique token. I think I'm not a like. I'm not an expert. But I think the idea is you give it a unique token that you know what not show up in other words. And so when they like, we train it with ukj.

02:00:53
<transcript>: It associates that Ukj person with the training images.

02:00:53
<transcript>: so that's what

02:01:00
<transcript>: So that's what we're doing. It's just a token. That, like, won't come up in any other words. So we don't leak.

02:01:04
<transcript>: We don't leak.

02:01:04
<transcript>: the

02:01:12
<transcript>: The idea of jiramos face into other text tokens. Does that make sense? So we could change some parameters here.

02:01:16
<transcript>: We could change our.

02:01:16
<transcript>: training images

02:01:17
<transcript>: Training images.

02:01:22
<transcript>: Let's try some more prompts just for fun. These. Let's.

02:01:26
<transcript>: What's this one do run radio UI for generating images.

02:01:33
<transcript>: Did it do it.

02:01:38
<transcript>: I don't know what Gradio UI is. I'm assuming things gonna launch in like another. Oh, Yeah.

02:01:42
<transcript>: Here we go. It's like an iframe.

02:01:49
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. Okay. So this is just a nicer interface for so photo of.

02:01:49
<transcript>: uk

02:01:52
<transcript>: Ukj person.

02:02:09
<transcript>: Negative prompt. I don't know even what that is, and if I should be using it.

02:02:22
<transcript>: This looks like gearma. Looking at a sunset.

02:02:25
texoport: negative prompt lets you specify what you don't want to see

02:02:26
<transcript>: Person.

02:02:29
<transcript>: In Fortnite. See how this looks.

02:02:37
<transcript>: Oh, what do you specify? What you don't want to see? Got it.

02:02:37
<transcript>: that makes

02:02:39
<transcript>: That makes sense.

02:02:41
<transcript>: So it's on the tin.

02:02:46
<transcript>: Yeah, it's still the models. Just never good.

02:02:49
<transcript>: Because that doesn't scream. Gary. Much of me.

02:02:53
<transcript>: All right, let's make a better.

02:02:56
<transcript>: Let's stop this.

02:03:00
<transcript>: Let's make a better model.

02:03:02
<transcript>: First, when we trained.

02:03:04
<transcript>: Let's see here.

02:03:08
<transcript>: Downloading.

02:03:13
texoport: "the model is not very good" xD. I remember what GANs were like when they first came out.

02:03:20
<transcript>: Is this our training? Step? Yeah. Train. Dream booth.

02:03:24
<transcript>: We're really taking advantage of the hardware. I wonder.

02:03:24
<transcript>: number of

02:03:26
<transcript>: Number of class images.

02:03:28
<transcript>: 50.

02:03:32
<transcript>: Max train steps will soon way more train steps. Maybe that's all we need to do.

02:03:34
texoport: I can't believe things are where they are now

02:03:36
<transcript>: Maybe we just train it for more steps.

02:03:38
<transcript>: 5000 steps.

02:03:42
<transcript>: Save sample prompt.

02:03:47
stroopwafel26: I'm actually impressed by the speed, you're not gonna get that with random hardware in a pc, gonna also subscribe to Colab now

02:03:48
<transcript>: Concept list.

02:03:53
<transcript>: Learning rate.

02:03:56
<transcript>: Fp 16.

02:03:56
<transcript>: so here's

02:03:59
<transcript>: So here's. This is the part where I want to.

02:04:02
<transcript>: Look up.

02:04:10
<transcript>: Vincent.

02:04:14
<transcript>: This is really where I've seen.

02:04:14
<transcript>: dream booth

02:04:16
<transcript>: Dream booth.

02:04:20
<transcript>: So on Twitter. Let's see.

02:04:20
<transcript>: from

02:04:22
<transcript>: From Vincent.

02:04:25
<transcript>: Re.

02:04:26
<transcript>: reamer

02:04:27
<transcript>: Reamer.

02:04:31
<transcript>: Let's this look up some of the things like.

02:04:44
<transcript>: We could look at precision or steps or prompts. We're gonna look up all this precision.

02:04:57
<transcript>: So Here's.

02:05:02
<transcript>: What prompting to use here.

02:05:02
<transcript>: doesn't say

02:05:03
<transcript>: Doesn't say.

02:05:09
<transcript>: Come on you buy.

02:05:14
<transcript>: Oh, here we go. Still of myself in Game of Thrones.

02:05:14
<transcript>: maybe i should

02:05:16
eddiethead1: is that colab project public?

02:05:16
<transcript>: Maybe I should try? Still.

02:05:21
<transcript>: Anime props.

02:05:26
<transcript>: 1980s mug shot.

02:05:26
<transcript>: his model

02:05:29
<transcript>: His model is so good.

02:05:48
<transcript>: Okay. I don't see any thing where he's talking about.

02:05:48
<transcript>: like

02:05:50
<transcript>: Like parameters.

02:06:03
<transcript>: So let's just try 5000 steps.

02:06:03
<transcript>: let's try that

02:06:09
<transcript>: Let's try that sample best. I'm not gonna change any of this. Do I actually have 50 of these? I think there's way more.

02:06:09
<transcript>: should i

02:06:11
<transcript>: Should I put how many.

02:06:11
<transcript>: that

02:06:20
<transcript>: That's class images, right? Yeah. Not instance images. We have, like, 300. Should I should I increase the number? Maybe I'll just do 393.

02:06:28
<transcript>: Okay.

02:06:29

kungfurykeyboard: I just generated jeff bezos as a muppet

02:06:30
<transcript>: Let's try retraining.

02:06:34
<transcript>: Let's do it.

02:06:36
kungfurykeyboard: https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/nvDmeuPZrlVgZa9gfD3sf1V6vxlrufwjFCNVDparcJu1PklfB/out-0.png

02:06:47
<transcript>: The model is not very good. I remember what Gans were like when I first came out. Can't believe things are where they are. Yeah, it's moving real fast. Like really kind of scary, fast.

02:06:53
<transcript>: Yeah, COLABS. Pretty great.

02:06:55
edmund311: I don't see the difference.

02:07:00
<transcript>: Is this Colab project? Public. This one? Yeah. Dream Boots, stable diffusion. That I just found that on the internet.

02:07:02
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:07:06
<transcript>: Can I just give you this link? Let's do it. I don't even know.

02:07:12
<transcript>: I think. Yeah. Oh, somebody already did street. It.

02:07:15
<transcript>: You generated Jeff Bezos as a Muppet.

02:07:15
<transcript>: oh my

02:07:18
<transcript>: Oh, my word, this is awesome.

02:07:19
eddiethead1: thx

02:07:29
<transcript>: Oh, it's too good. It really looks like Jeff Bezos, doesn't it.

02:07:35
stroopwafel26: @KungFuryKeyboard they're the same picture

02:07:35
<transcript>: This is like the stuff of nightmares, but Wow.

02:07:35
<transcript>: that's awesome

02:07:36
<transcript>: That's awesome.

02:07:36
<transcript>: thank you

02:07:41
<transcript>: Thank you so much for sharing that. Come, Fury, I don't see the difference.

02:07:41
<transcript>: same picture

02:07:44
<transcript>: Same picture. Oh, man, that's good.

02:07:54
<transcript>: We're, like two and a half hours to Nick's Discomp, right? Am I getting the times right? Wait a minute. I'm getting the Time's wrong? Are they? I'm way off.

02:07:54
<transcript>: when this next

02:07:57
<transcript>: When this next Go start.

02:07:57
<transcript>: i'm way

02:07:59
<transcript>: I'm way off on the times.

02:08:03
<transcript>: 4 hours oh, my word. I was so far off.

02:08:03
<transcript>: four and

02:08:05
<transcript>: Four and a half hours.

02:08:05
<transcript>: so

02:08:15
stroopwafel26: as you said, 10 hour stream

02:08:15
<transcript>: So starts at yeah, noon my time. Okay. Sorry. I mean, I'm still gonna do it, but like if you were hoping it was starting soon. Sorry for misleading everyone.

02:08:22
<transcript>: Okay, this should take a bit to run now, because we're doing so many more steps. 5000 steps.

02:08:26
<transcript>: Ten hour stream, though.

02:08:26
<transcript>: i'm here for

02:08:27
<transcript>: I'm here for it.

02:08:37
<transcript>: Maybe I'll start looking at like.

02:08:40
<transcript>: Setting up these you eyes like automatic.

02:08:40
stroopwafel26: that's like 40 larabars

02:09:17
<transcript>: I can.

02:09:21
xkarvel: Hey

02:09:27
<transcript>: Thanks so much for the follow Ex Carvel and welcome to chat.

02:09:31
<transcript>: 40, Larabars.

02:09:34
<transcript>: Fight 40 Lar Bowels. I'll be feeling pretty bad.

02:09:47
xkarvel: Studying Software engineering. Glad I found you here on twitch

02:09:59
<transcript>: Okay. So I should say that my machine to run stable diffusion. Shouldn't I.

02:10:05
stroopwafel26: lots of students here on twitch

02:10:05
<transcript>: 'll do that while we're training.

02:10:07
<transcript>: Guys gonna take a bit.

02:10:07
<transcript>: okay

02:10:08
stroopwafel26: cool

02:10:10
<transcript>: Okay, stable diffusion.

02:10:13
<transcript>: Come on, Mac.

02:10:17
<transcript>: They're almost too many guides for doing this.

02:10:25
<transcript>: We'll go with the Hugging Face guide.

02:10:38
stiefbroerikzitvast: whatcha building?

02:10:52
<transcript>: Oh, it's on the CPU in it.

02:10:56
<transcript>: I mean we won't be doing any training.

02:11:02
<transcript>: We won't be doing any training on the Mac, so that's probably fine.

02:11:05
<transcript>: Awesome.

02:11:16
<transcript>: Oh, I didn't turn music back on.

02:11:20
stroopwafel26: hallo stiefbroer

02:11:26
<transcript>: Okay.

02:11:46
<transcript>: We're gonna do this. Python. Three.

02:11:51
<transcript>: Ten, six.

02:12:04
<transcript>: I think I did this. Oh, no. This is different.

02:12:15
<transcript>: Playground. Wait. No, I'm in. I'm in this playground. Right.

02:12:33
<transcript>: Set up a virtual environment.

02:12:33
<transcript>: i think

02:12:36
<transcript>: I think I already have her virtual environment.

02:12:42
<transcript>: Never let's do this.

02:12:56
<transcript>: Okay.

02:13:15
<transcript>: I'm gonna be totally embarrassed if I don't have like Rust already installed. Am I even a real developer? Step, row.

02:13:20
<transcript>: Set rows. Here we are making a.

02:13:20
<transcript>: stable fusion

02:13:23
<transcript>: Stable Fusion Dream Dream Booth model.

02:13:23
<transcript>: of

02:13:32
<transcript>: Of Guillermo Rock's Face. Because this next jazz confidence. And we want to make cool portraits of him doing stuff.

02:13:32
<transcript>: and weird

02:13:34
<transcript>: And weird settings.

02:13:34
<transcript>: celebrate

02:13:35
<transcript>: Celebrate.

02:13:44
<transcript>: Setting software in June. Glad you found here on Twitter. Hey, well, that's great.

02:13:48
<transcript>: I have thoughts on Sam, software engineering.

02:13:48
<transcript>: and new people

02:13:59
<transcript>: And new people into the industry. I just shared them earlier on their stream. Basically, I think it's dumb that we funnel all new software engineers into frontend. And I don't think that should be the only place that people could start.

02:13:59
<transcript>: i think it's maybe

02:14:04
<transcript>: I think it's maybe the worst place to start personally, maybe not the worst place, but not the best place.

02:14:07
<transcript>: Leaf Eater. Thank you for the follow.

02:14:13
<transcript>: What are we doing right now? What is this doing.

02:14:17
<transcript>: Over installing all the Pip.

02:14:17
<transcript>: packages

02:14:19
<transcript>: Packages.

02:14:19
<transcript>: then we have to

02:14:21
<transcript>: Then we have to download the weights.

02:14:30
<transcript>: Oh, almost leaked it, but it's not shown.

02:14:37
leafeaterii: Hey what’s up! :)

02:14:37
<transcript>: Okay, where is the.

02:14:38
<transcript>: here we go

02:14:39
<transcript>: Here we go.

02:14:39
<transcript>: st

02:14:41
<transcript>: Stable diffusion.

02:14:45
xkarvel: Atm "starting" c++ . Udemy course to try to get some more knowledge

02:14:46
<transcript>: Download the weights. One, Five, pruned.

02:14:52
<transcript>: What I want. Sd one. This was on one, four was a thing.

02:15:03
<transcript>: What's up, Li? Peter, welcome to chat.

02:15:19
<transcript>: You're starting CPU plus. Okay, cool. Udemy course to try to get some more knowledge. So that is not front end. That's a much better place to start. I think. I mean, maybe not like specifically C, but I just think like.

02:15:19
<transcript>: learning program

02:15:24
<transcript>: Learning programming concepts without all the baggage of frontend web stuff.

02:15:24
<transcript>: state management

02:15:26
<transcript>: State management.

02:15:26
<transcript>: css libr

02:15:37
<transcript>: Css libraries react. Hooks like having to learn all that stuff when you're just new to the field and trying to get into it feels like a recipe for, like, maybe I don't want to do this software thing.

02:15:40
<transcript>: That's just my feelings.

02:15:46
<transcript>: Suitable for inference. Suitable for finetuning.

02:15:47
xkarvel: Loved React honestly but probably not real my thing

02:15:50
<transcript>: We're gonna download this one.

02:15:59
<transcript>: Okay.

02:15:59
<transcript>: that's seven

02:16:04
<transcript>: That's seven gigs. Downloading. Where are we on training? Here. 17%.

02:16:04
<transcript>: so we've

02:16:08
xkarvel: We made some cool stuff but classes in general just create monkeys..

02:16:15
<transcript>: So we've already eclipsed the 800 steps we did in the last model. I feel good about this. I think more steps is gonna be an improvement. We also gave it more class images. I don't know if that's good or bad. We'll find out.

02:16:18
xkarvel: university classes*

02:16:26
<transcript>: Love to react honestly, but probably not my route. Not really my thing. We made some cool stuff, but classes in general just create monkeys.

02:16:35
<transcript>: All right? Is Pivot? Really? Is Pip still installing? Is that where we're at right now.

02:16:50
<transcript>: Building the wheel for tokenizers. This is where it might fail. We might have to install. Surely I have CMake. I don't know about proto buff. I know I've installed rest. I just know it.

02:16:50
<transcript>: oh no

02:16:52
<transcript>: Oh, no. Have I not.

02:16:55
<transcript>: Failed building wheel.

02:16:55
<transcript>: yeah we got to

02:16:57
<transcript>: Yeah, we got to do this.

02:16:57
<transcript>: i just hate

02:17:00
<transcript>: I just hate running brew install because.

02:17:03
<transcript>: It's a whole thing.

02:17:03
<transcript>: every time i

02:17:07
<transcript>: Every time I do Brian Solid installs like everything I've ever installed with Bruce.

02:17:28
stroopwafel26: your cam is lagging because of the pip install i think

02:17:33
<transcript>: Okay. So we're gonna get this going. It's still building stuff.

02:17:42
<transcript>: We're gonna have to reinstall Pip. I mean the packages I used to do some Python in my day.

02:17:44
<transcript>: Used to.

02:17:45
stroopwafel26: finally your mac hit its max :P

02:17:47
<transcript>: I used to.

02:17:53
<transcript>: We're gonna drag this into code.

02:17:57
<transcript>: Model.

02:18:00
<transcript>: We're gonna put it in playground.

02:18:05
<transcript>: Dream booth.

02:18:08
<transcript>: And what was that directory I just made.

02:18:11
stroopwafel26: it's OK again haha

02:18:12
<transcript>: P models.

02:18:14
<transcript>: Wait.

02:18:14
<transcript>: model

02:18:17
<transcript>: Models LDM I don't know see a models.

02:18:24
<transcript>: We're one of my missing here. Stable diffusion. Okay.

02:18:24
<transcript>: models

02:18:26
<transcript>: Models.

02:18:28
<transcript>: Ldm.

02:18:31
<transcript>: I.

02:18:37
<transcript>: Was stable diffusion version one.

02:18:40
<transcript>: Model CKPT.

02:18:44
<transcript>: Okay.

02:18:47
<transcript>: Downloaded it. I put it in there.

02:18:47
<transcript>: knock around

02:18:51
<transcript>: Knock around stable diffusion. Okay, so that means now we can.

02:18:54
<transcript>: What that means is.

02:18:58
<transcript>: Now.

02:19:02
<transcript>: We can install this. The front end, right.

02:19:06
<transcript>: Autumn, this thing.

02:19:12
<transcript>: Installation on Apple, Silicon.

02:19:20
<transcript>: Oh, my camera was Lagging, really.

02:19:23
<transcript>: Pip, install.

02:19:25
<transcript>: Taking it down.

02:19:37
<transcript>: Important Notes while the WEBR runs fine, there's still certain issues when running this fork on Apple soldier.

02:19:45
<transcript>: You learn DPM all of the results in a black screen.

02:19:50
<transcript>: Okay.

02:19:53
<transcript>: Automatic installation.

02:19:56
<transcript>: Open Terminal App. Run this.

02:20:01
<transcript>: Just run that shell script.

02:20:05
<transcript>: We feel good about that. Just run it.

02:20:16
<transcript>: Okay, let's see if this is all working now.

02:20:25
<transcript>: Juicy Apple floating in outer space Oh.

02:20:27
<transcript>: Fail.

02:20:30
<transcript>: From Omega cuff.

02:20:30
<transcript>: no module name

02:20:33
<transcript>: No module named Omega. Comp.

02:20:41
<transcript>: Did I repip install? I thought I did.

02:20:46
<transcript>: Oh, come on.

02:20:52
<transcript>: I just need to Pip and Psalm Omega. Comp.

02:21:05
<transcript>: I'm guessing I just need to Pip and solo megacomps.

02:21:09
<transcript>: I don't know why it wasn't in the.

02:21:20
<transcript>: Tip like a Pip.

02:21:20
<transcript>: three

02:21:21
<transcript>: Three.

02:21:27
<transcript>: Okay.

02:21:27
<transcript>: successfully

02:21:28
<transcript>: Successfully.

02:21:30
<transcript>: Did it do it.

02:21:39
<transcript>: No module named I Am watermark.

02:21:39
<transcript>: piped install

02:21:42
<transcript>: Piped Install I am Water Mark.

02:21:42
<transcript>: this is a

02:21:46
<transcript>: This is a recap. We're waiting on this model to train.

02:21:46
<transcript>: it

02:21:54
<transcript>: It's gonna take a while. We're doing 50 training sets. We are installing the front end.

02:21:58
<transcript>: So that we can play with the model on our machine, hopefully.

02:22:01
<transcript>: That's the idea anyway.

02:22:05
<transcript>: I am watermark.

02:22:09
<transcript>: Primer already satisfied. Numpy.

02:22:09
<transcript>: for my water

02:22:11
<transcript>: For my watermark well.

02:22:11
<transcript>: that's

02:22:12
<transcript>: That's not ideal.

02:22:17
<transcript>: Maybe we're not in our are we in our thing.

02:22:21
<transcript>: Are we in here.

02:22:26
<transcript>: No I.

02:22:33
<transcript>: Module named I Am watermark.

02:22:45
<transcript>: I am.

02:22:45
<transcript>: wat

02:22:48
<transcript>: Watter. Mark. Yeah, that's what I installed.

02:22:54
<transcript>: Well, what do we think? What do we think.

02:23:05
<transcript>: As discord.

02:23:18
<transcript>: I might just need to run a VM.

02:23:18
<transcript>: for the

02:23:20
<transcript>: For the UI.

02:23:24
<transcript>: If I want to use that automatic UI.

02:23:34
<transcript>: What is Vincent use? He said what he uses.

02:23:36
<transcript>: Ui.

02:23:39
tiredbeaver: i lost all of my tabs sadge

02:23:49
<transcript>: Is this what is for anyone asked you I am using it from this project. So automatic. 111. So what should I do? Should I just make like a Windows box? What's the best.

02:23:49
<transcript>: what's the best

02:23:50
<transcript>: What's the best.

02:23:56
<transcript>: Operating system to run this stuff on.

02:24:03
<transcript>: Oh, no, Santa tired Beaver, you lost all your tabs? Oof.

02:24:03
<transcript>: that hurts

02:24:06
<transcript>: That hurts, hurts, it pains me.

02:24:06
<transcript>: to

02:24:09
<transcript>: To think losing my tabs.

02:24:15
<transcript>: So I don't know. Do we think we can run? We could try running the UI here.

02:24:16
tsoutsou_proutsou: ctrl shift t

02:24:18
<transcript>: Let's just make sure we have all these.

02:24:18
<transcript>: i think we

02:24:21
<transcript>: I think we actually have all these. Yeah.

02:24:22
tiredbeaver: tried that

02:24:25
tiredbeaver: didn't work

02:24:26
<transcript>: C make proto buff, rust Python get weight yeah, we got this script can be downloaded from here.

02:24:26
<transcript>: or

02:24:30
<transcript>: Or just do it like this.

02:24:38
<transcript>: I'm just trusting this person with my machine's life. Now, what's wrong? Oh, I.

02:24:48
<transcript>: I guess we we did copy, so I just need to Ch mod plus X setup Mac sh.

02:24:48
<transcript>: and then

02:24:50
<transcript>: And then set up.

02:24:50
<transcript>: mac

02:24:51
<transcript>: Mac.

02:24:51
<transcript>: sh

02:24:55
<transcript>: Sh. Here's. Here we go. Oh, wait. What.

02:25:00
<transcript>: Right there.

02:25:03
<transcript>: Oh, I did it's underscore.

02:25:07
stroopwafel26: underscore

02:25:08
<transcript>: Here we go.

02:25:08
<transcript>: is it gonna work

02:25:09
<transcript>: Is it gonna work.

02:25:09
<transcript>: what do we think

02:25:10
<transcript>: What do we think.

02:25:14
<transcript>: What do we think? What do we think? What do we think.

02:25:14
<transcript>: proceed

02:25:15
<transcript>: Proceed.

02:25:15
<transcript>: yes

02:25:16
<transcript>: Yes.

02:25:34
<transcript>: This album is what I listen to like nonstop. When I was building statmes, like the very first.

02:25:41
<transcript>: The very first version of Stat Muse. This is the song I listened to almost on repeat.

02:25:53
<transcript>: I have already downloaded a model, right? If you've already download them all, now you now have time to copy it yourself. To stablefusionwebui model, stable diffusion. Okay.

02:25:55
<transcript>: Let's do that.

02:26:01
<transcript>: With stable.

02:26:03
<transcript>: Diffusion.

02:26:06
<transcript>: We need to put it into.

02:26:06
<transcript>: stable diffusion

02:26:07
<transcript>: Stable diffusion.

02:26:07
<transcript>: my direct

02:26:09
<transcript>: My directories. Here.

02:26:09
<transcript>: are

02:26:12
<transcript>: Are a mess. Web. Ui.

02:26:15
<transcript>: So I need to put it into here in models.

02:26:15
stroopwafel26: 2.0 is a banger

02:26:19
<transcript>: In that one.

02:26:19
<transcript>: stable

02:26:20
<transcript>: Stable.

02:26:28
<transcript>: Put stable diffusion checkpoints here. Okay.

02:26:37
<transcript>: That's all I want. Okay. So I need to put.

02:26:38
<transcript>: A model.

02:26:42
<transcript>: In there? Do I just name it model. That's.

02:26:46
<transcript>: Where we at here. 38%.

02:26:46
noob_cod3r: your thoughts on prisma

02:26:49
<transcript>: So copy.

02:26:52
<transcript>: Downloads.

02:26:52
<transcript>: model

02:26:52
<transcript>: Model.

02:26:52
<transcript>: ccpt

02:26:54
<transcript>: Ccpt.

02:27:00
<transcript>: I want to copy it to the current directory.

02:27:03
<transcript>: How can I do that? Like.

02:27:06
<transcript>: This work.

02:27:09
<transcript>: Can I do that.

02:27:16
<transcript>: Oh, it's not actually there. Where did I put that.

02:27:26
<transcript>: Did I leave it here? Just rename something else. Now. I moved it. I moved it. I moved it.

02:27:26
<transcript>: where

02:27:29
<transcript>: Where did I move it? Somebody. Where did I move it.

02:27:29
<transcript>: let's go back

02:27:34
<transcript>: Let's go back to the VOD. Somebody? No, I think it's in here somewhere. Models.

02:27:37
<transcript>: Ldm.

02:27:39
<transcript>: Wait. What.

02:27:39
<transcript>: now

02:27:41
<transcript>: Now, Dream, Bruce.

02:27:41
<transcript>: stable fusion

02:27:42
<transcript>: Stable fusion.

02:27:45
<transcript>: Oof.

02:27:50
<transcript>: Models.

02:27:50
<transcript>: ld

02:27:52
<transcript>: Ldm.

02:27:52
<transcript>: stabilization

02:27:55
<transcript>: Stabilization V. One. There it is.

02:28:00
<transcript>: Okay. I want to put that in.

02:28:05
<transcript>: Here.

02:28:19
<transcript>: What's this? Say? Nothing.

02:28:23
<transcript>: Okay. I copied it. There.

02:28:28
<transcript>: Did you already install the model? Yes.

02:28:36
<transcript>: Enter in to download the model from hugging Face. Oh, I could just let them do it.

02:28:39
<transcript>: I already did it.

02:28:49
<transcript>: 20 is a banger? 20? What Stroop.

02:28:49
<transcript>: oh

02:28:56
stroopwafel26: 2.0 the album

02:28:58
<transcript>: Oh, noob, cutter. Your thoughts on Prisma. My thoughts on Prisma. I think it's kind of slow. I think it's really slow and nobody. I don't see people talking about it.

02:28:58
<transcript>: things really slow

02:29:00
<transcript>: Things really slow.

02:29:00
<transcript>: i mean most

02:29:03
stroopwafel26: from big data

02:29:03
<transcript>: I mean most Orms that generate gnarly SQL queries.

02:29:05
<transcript>: Are inherently.

02:29:05
<transcript>: slower

02:29:11
<transcript>: Slower than like handcrafting sequel that you know is performant but also.

02:29:11
<transcript>: it's giant

02:29:17
<transcript>: It's giant and if you load it in the serverless context, like most people do in like an XGS API route.

02:29:17
<transcript>: it's low

02:29:20
<transcript>: It's low cold stars, really bad.

02:29:20
<transcript>: because it's

02:29:25
<transcript>: Because it's giant and you can't put giant things in Lambda functions and not get cold starts.

02:29:25
<transcript>: so there's

02:29:29
<transcript>: So there's my thought you can find the repos and stabilization error.

02:29:29
<transcript>: error

02:29:37
<transcript>: Error the check for the models and required repositories. As failed. We circle the models in place. I don't know if I named it right? You didn't tell me what to name the model.

02:29:37
<transcript>: so that's

02:29:39
<transcript>: So that's on you.

02:29:41
<transcript>: Sorry I'm getting heated.

02:29:46
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, two point. Oh, yeah, no, I love this. I love this bottle.

02:29:46
<transcript>: i love

02:29:48
<transcript>: I love Big Data's album.

02:29:52
<transcript>: Let's do.

02:29:58
<transcript>: Let's rerun this.

02:29:58
<transcript>: we're gonna say

02:30:01
<transcript>: We're gonna say download the model for us.

02:30:01
<transcript>: i don't care

02:30:02
<transcript>: I don't care.

02:30:08
<transcript>: Oh, Jeez Invalid, Yes.

02:30:13
<transcript>: So we're gonna let them download the model because they know what they want. It named, I do not.

02:30:21
<transcript>: Nickel Creek might be coming out of the playlist along with Andrew bird.

02:30:34
<transcript>: No, please install it for me. Please enter your hugging face token. Alright, fuzzy time.

02:30:43
<transcript>: Did I make it fuzzy.

02:30:48
<transcript>: I didn't make it fuzzy today.

02:30:54
<transcript>: I did make it fuzzy. Okay.

02:30:55
<transcript>: there's a huge

02:30:57
stroopwafel26: it's fuzzy

02:30:57
<transcript>: There's a huge delay on my monitor.

02:31:02
<transcript>: Hugging face token. Let's copy this thing.

02:31:20
<transcript>: Alright.

02:31:24
<transcript>: We are at halfway the halfway Mark.

02:31:34
<transcript>: Halfway on our Our Colab training session. Training a new checkpoint on Guillermo space.

02:31:39
<transcript>: I'm just waiting on this to move away from the screen so I can share it again.

02:31:39
<transcript>: right

02:31:42
<transcript>: Right now we are showing.

02:31:47
<transcript>: We are showing my token.

02:31:47
<transcript>: i don't want

02:31:49
<transcript>: I don't want to do that.

02:31:56
<transcript>: Okay.

02:32:09
<transcript>: How's Everybody doing.

02:32:11
<transcript>: How's everybody.

02:32:11
<transcript>: i'm just kind of

02:32:13
<transcript>: I'm just kind of waiting on stuff right now.

02:32:13
<transcript>: we got our model

02:32:15
<transcript>: We got our model training.

02:32:18
<transcript>: In the cloud we've got.

02:32:20
<transcript>: Something happening.

02:32:20
<transcript>: trying to install

02:32:26
<transcript>: Trying to install the web UI on my local machine. I would love to be able to run the web UI on my local machine.

02:32:28
<transcript>: And.

02:32:36
<transcript>: And just download checkpoints from Google Colab and this player with it that way. I think it'd be easier.

02:32:41
<transcript>: But we got a good model for you first. So if the model's no good.

02:32:41
<transcript>: who cares

02:32:43
<transcript>: Who cares.

02:32:52
<transcript>: Any predictions in a guy next JS. Comp predictions.

02:32:58
<transcript>: I made mine yesterday was the same prediction I made last year, which is.

02:32:58
<transcript>: zero j

02:33:03
<transcript>: Zero JS by default. I mean it's more likely this year with the server components.

02:33:06
<transcript>: But basically like Astro.

02:33:06
<transcript>: does the

02:33:09
<transcript>: Does the like you opt in to client.

02:33:09
<transcript>: javascript

02:33:11
<transcript>: Javascript.

02:33:17
<transcript>: I think they'll do that this year. I think that's part of next year, next year, 13.

02:33:17
<transcript>: silk fur

02:33:20
<transcript>: Silk Fury, thank you for the follow.

02:33:24
<transcript>: following

02:33:24
<transcript>: Following.

02:33:38
<transcript>: Still installing stuff. Let's just come over here and talk.

02:33:40
<transcript>: Gotta wake you all up.

02:33:45
<transcript>: Who's even here? I don't even know who's here anymore. Cuz nobody's talking.

02:33:52
<transcript>: Stroop. Is here. Those Stroops here.

02:33:53
stroopwafel26: I'm knee deep into terraform again

02:33:58
<transcript>: Knee deepen TerraForm.

02:34:00
<transcript>: You.

02:34:02
<transcript>: Sounds awful.

02:34:06
fanieldanara: o/

02:34:11
<transcript>: Let's play with I want to play with my cameras.

02:34:11
<transcript>: let's do this

02:34:12
<transcript>: Let's do this.

02:34:18
<transcript>: Can I actually pull up the web UI for this thing.

02:34:20
stroopwafel26: I actually like terraform a lot, but then again i build infrastructure for a living :P

02:34:23
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:34:31
<transcript>: The Working I.

02:34:35
<transcript>: 'm Gonna Change My scene.

02:34:42
<transcript>: This is just on board. I'm just blind waiting on this thing. Oh, did it finish? It might have finished.

02:34:45
<transcript>: Oh, it failed.

02:34:45
cowfacedude99: I am knee deep in setting up dev env for go and nix.

02:34:48
<transcript>: I think it failed.

02:34:53
<transcript>: Okay, we're not gonna run the web UI on my machine. We'll just do it in the cloud. That's fine.

02:34:56
<transcript>: So I've got this camera over here.

02:34:56
<transcript>: this one

02:34:57
<transcript>: This one.

02:35:06
<transcript>: I'm not on a break. I don't want to do that. This one. There we go. And I can move it around with these joysticks. This is fine.

02:35:11
<transcript>: I'm gonna move this over here.

02:35:13
cowfacedude99: nix + direnv + git worktrees are magic!!!

02:35:16
<transcript>: So like I can move it between poses.

02:35:18
<transcript>: Right.

02:35:22
<transcript>: So I did this during the break.

02:35:25
<transcript>: breakfast

02:35:25
<transcript>: breakfast cow faces

02:35:32
stroopwafel26: @cowfacedude99 so good

02:35:35
<transcript>: Breakfast, cow faces here kneedeep and setting up Dev environment for go and NYX. So what is all the NYX? Hype. Tell me coffee, Nick, plus durnviv plus gitwork trees are magic.

02:35:35
<transcript>: so good

02:35:36
<transcript>: So good.

02:35:36
<transcript>: so good

02:35:37
<transcript>: So good.

02:35:44
<transcript>: So then I can just, like, arbitrarily pan and tilt, like, just move this camera around.

02:35:46
cowfacedude99: still wondering if I should write up an article

02:35:50
<transcript>: There's, there's my green screen. There's a light pull.

02:35:50
<transcript>: there's

02:35:52
<transcript>: There's my mic.

02:35:58
<transcript>: Oh, there's my camera in my teleprompter. Here, let's drop this down.

02:36:04
<transcript>: This is so much fun.

02:36:04
<transcript>: i

02:36:05
<transcript>: I.

02:36:05
<transcript>: prompt

02:36:08
<transcript>: Prompter. That's like what I'm when I look at you guys.

02:36:11
<transcript>: I'm like looking at this thing.

02:36:11
<transcript>: there's

02:36:16
<transcript>: There's my camera. Behind it, showing my face. There's me waving.

02:36:20
<transcript>: We can go over here.

02:36:21
guillermorodas: WOW

02:36:28
<transcript>: Wait. Gear Mo. Another gear Mo.

02:36:31
<transcript>: All right, we're moving it over here.

02:36:31
<transcript>: get a little different

02:36:34
<transcript>: Get a little different view there's my coffee cups.

02:36:34
<transcript>: there's my lar bar

02:36:36
<transcript>: There's my Lar bar.

02:36:36
<transcript>: there's

02:36:38
<transcript>: There's the floor.

02:36:38
<transcript>: there

02:36:38
cowfacedude99: all you need to start is https://nix.dev/

02:36:40
<transcript>: There's a light.

02:36:42
<transcript>: There's me.

02:36:46
<transcript>: I'm so bored.

02:36:46
<transcript>: all

02:36:52
<transcript>: All you need to start is NYX Dev. Okay, I'm gonna take a look at it.

02:36:55
<transcript>: Let's.

02:36:55
<transcript>: go back

02:36:57
<transcript>: Go back to my screen.

02:37:04
<transcript>: Wait a minute. What did I do with Chrome? I put it over here.

02:37:07
<transcript>: I.

02:37:17
<transcript>: Lost Chrome again.

02:37:25
<transcript>: Where's come.

02:37:25
<transcript>: did i

02:37:27
<transcript>: Did I close Chrome.

02:37:31
<transcript>: Oh, There it is.

02:37:35
<transcript>: Okay.

02:37:38
<transcript>: Why can't I get it? Come over here.

02:37:40
<transcript>: There we go.

02:37:45
guillermorodas: Mac OS Ventura?

02:37:46
<transcript>: Okay, so we're not gonna run the web UI. We're just training the model.

02:37:48
<transcript>: We're just doing this.

02:37:59
<transcript>: And we're at 60%.

02:38:05
<transcript>: Yes, Maclis Finchur. That's right. Gear. Mo.

02:38:06
<transcript>: moonx

02:38:06
<transcript>: moonx dev

02:38:08
<transcript>: Moonx Dev.

02:38:13
<transcript>: We're just literally waiting on a thing to train, so.

02:38:13
<transcript>: why not

02:38:14
<transcript>: Why not.

02:38:14
<transcript>: welcome

02:38:17
<transcript>: Welcome to Nick Dev.

02:38:25
<transcript>: Nick's ecosystem is DevOps to achieve reproduce reproducible development environments easy installation software URLs.

02:38:34
<transcript>: Easy transfer software environments between computers declare the specification of Linux machines reproducible integration testing is a virtual machines.

02:38:37
<transcript>: Okay.

02:38:37
<transcript>: sounds good

02:38:39
<transcript>: Sounds good.

02:38:42
<transcript>: Wait a minute.

02:38:44
<transcript>: Wait a minute. Nick's.

02:38:44
<transcript>: no

02:38:46
<transcript>: No.

02:38:46
<transcript>: think

02:38:48
<transcript>: Think of something else.

02:38:56
<transcript>: What am I thinking of.

02:38:56
<transcript>: what's

02:39:04
<transcript>: What's? The mono repo thing? That's not Turbo Rebo. But the other thing is that Nick. No, that's a monoreto thing.

02:39:12
<transcript>: So what's it for.

02:39:15
<transcript>: What do you use it for? Cafe.

02:39:22
<transcript>: Music because that's a lot of things it does.

02:39:26
<transcript>: And Heart Developer environments.

02:39:30
<transcript>: Do you replace like T MOX with it or something.

02:39:40
cowfacedude99: I replace brew with it

02:39:48
<transcript>: So this is how you install it. You are you on a Mac.

02:39:53
<transcript>: So cow face is on a Mac.

02:39:53
<transcript>: i would have thought

02:39:56
<transcript>: I would have thought you were like I'm an Arch Linux for sure.

02:40:00
cowfacedude99: I use a mac for work

02:40:05
<transcript>: So you don't use Bruce. So this will actually install software.

02:40:08
<transcript>: Instead of brew.

02:40:09
cowfacedude99: I use nixos for other stuff

02:40:16
<transcript>: Use a Mac for work mix OS for other stuff gotcha.

02:40:21
nexxeln: isn't nix an os?

02:40:35
<transcript>: Thousands of packages. Okay. So it has its own package manager. So people who make software and they publish it like to the brew.

02:40:35
<transcript>: repository

02:40:41
<transcript>: Repository. They also have to publish it to NYX. Or does Nick's work with other repositories or something.

02:40:46
<transcript>: Purely functional package manager.

02:41:04
<transcript>: Sounds like it's. It's all of the things. What did I just open.

02:41:05
cowfacedude99: the neat thing about this is that you can have packages installed per folder level. so managing node versions is a lot cleaner

02:41:13
<transcript>: I guess what? We're waiting on this model to train. I could pull up.

02:41:18
<transcript>: I could pull up AW, guess I do need to make some progress.

02:41:22
cowfacedude99: @nexxeln it's a language, package manager and os.

02:41:22
<transcript>: I can't I can't get my Chrome windows to.

02:41:27
<transcript>: Buying me.

02:41:27
<transcript>: the

02:41:34
<transcript>: The neat thing about this is that you can have packages installed per folder level, so managing node versions is a lot cleaner. Oh, that's cool.

02:41:39
<transcript>: It's a language package, Matter and OS it's a language.

02:41:43
nexxeln: wow

02:41:44
<transcript>: Okay. I had the wrong mental model for NixOS.

02:41:51
<transcript>: Or for Nick, the Nick's ecosystem, I guess.

02:41:54
<transcript>: 68%.

02:41:56
estrangedhd: That's a lot of tabs

02:41:59
<transcript>: Maybe I'll start closing some Tags. Tabs? What do you think.

02:41:59
<transcript>: we don't

02:42:01
<transcript>: We don't need this.

02:42:06
cowfacedude99: nixos is a os that uses nix to manage itself.

02:42:10
<transcript>: We tried to install so many things we tried and failed.

02:42:23
<transcript>: Wonder if I can make this training even faster if I just set some parameters better, more correctly.

02:42:26
nexxeln: so nixos is neovim and nix is lua

02:42:36
nexxeln: is it that sort of thing

02:42:42
<transcript>: Okay.

02:42:46
<transcript>: Pytorch.

02:42:58
<transcript>: It's always the stuff I don't want to listen to that keeps popping up.

02:42:58
<transcript>: i really

02:42:59
cowfacedude99: the nix package manager installs stuff on nixos, or other systems that have nix installed

02:43:00
<transcript>: I really should remove it, but.

02:43:22
texoport: I thought nix just used Haskell for configs. I haven't looked at it in a bit

02:43:27
cowfacedude99: and nix language is the language you use to set up your environments.

02:43:28
<transcript>: Should I just set up a Windows VM so that I can use.

02:43:28
<transcript>: the

02:43:29
<transcript>: The.

02:43:29
<transcript>: ui

02:43:31
<transcript>: Ui.

02:43:31
<transcript>: i could do that

02:43:32
<transcript>: I could do that.

02:43:37
<transcript>: Raise our Web hosted.

02:43:41
cowfacedude99: atleast that's how I understand it

02:43:42
<transcript>: Web hosted Automatics. That thing.

02:43:49
<transcript>: Yeah, this.

02:43:51
<transcript>: Your Web hosted one of those.

02:44:06
cowfacedude99: @texoport I think it's similar to haskell but I haven't used haskell so I can't comment

02:44:08
<transcript>: Maybe there can't be does it? I guess for inference is it still needs the hardware acceleration, the GPU.

02:44:10
laytanl_: this filter looks great!

02:44:15
laytanl_: LUL

02:44:21
cowfacedude99: LUL @laytanl_

02:44:25
<transcript>: So next.

02:44:25
<transcript>: a lot of

02:44:27
<transcript>: A lot of tabs.

02:44:41
<transcript>: Nixos is an OS that uses Nix to manage itself. So Mixelus is Neal Vim, and NYX is Lua that sort of thing. The Mix package installs stuff on NixOS, Mix, OS, or other systems that makes it solved.

02:44:41
<transcript>: today

02:44:42
<transcript>: Today.

02:44:54
<transcript>: This filter so broken. I'm a green screen.

02:44:56
<transcript>: It's pretty broken.

02:45:00
<transcript>: We're still at 74%. You know what.

02:45:00
<transcript>: let's talk

02:45:04
<transcript>: Let's talk next year. Let's talk about.

02:45:04
<transcript>: we got next

02:45:05
<transcript>: We got next JS. Comp.

02:45:10
<transcript>: We're waiting for this model to train where it's 75%.

02:45:16
<transcript>: I think it's going as fast as it can, although I do wonder.

02:45:16
<transcript>: i wonder

02:45:23
<transcript>: I wonder if I'm using number of CPU threads per process number of machines, number of processes.

02:45:29
laytanl_: What time is it & will it be streamed?

02:45:30
<transcript>: I wonder if I could have taken advantage of the hardware on this thing more.

02:45:37
<transcript>: Okay.

02:45:37
<transcript>: what time is

02:45:42
<transcript>: What time is it? And will it be streamed? Yes, it is in.

02:45:49
<transcript>: 3 hours and 45 minutes. We're gonna watch it right here on this very channel.

02:45:49
<transcript>: if

02:45:51
<transcript>: If you want to watch it with me.

02:45:54
<transcript>: Hang out or come back later.

02:45:58
<transcript>: I'll watch at least a Keynote and maybe a little bit more.

02:46:03
laytanl_: Oh for sure!

02:46:04
<transcript>: Will react in real time the next GS 13.

02:46:07
cowfacedude99: you will keep the watchparty vod right? because I won't be able to watch it. timezones :(

02:46:07
<transcript>: All the other things that they're gonna announce.

02:46:10
<transcript>: So what are they gonna announce.

02:46:10
<transcript>: well you keep

02:46:12
laytanl_: Long stream then

02:46:14
<transcript>: Well, you keep the watch. Party VOD, right? Because I won't build a watch. It time zone.

02:46:14
<transcript>: yeah

02:46:19
texoport: Next conf on the day I decide to move to Remix? Pog

02:46:24
<transcript>: Yeah. In fact, Calface, I'm doing a YouTube video this week. I'm recapping the entire conference. I'm gonna watch every session, start to finish. I'm gonna recap the whole thing.

02:46:26
<transcript>: That should be out on Friday.

02:46:26
<transcript>: as long as i

02:46:29
<transcript>: As long as I get access to all the video.

02:46:29
<transcript>: so i'm not gonna

02:46:45
<transcript>: So I'm not gonna watch it all live, either. I'm gonna watch like the first half of it live and then hopefully the rest of it on demand after. And then if it's out quick enough, then I'll do. I'll do the whole thing. Otherwise I'll just recap the first stuff, this, the keynote and the big talking points of next. Yes.

02:46:45
<transcript>: it's a long str

02:46:47
<transcript>: It's a long stream today.

02:46:47
<transcript>: this is gonna be

02:46:50
<transcript>: This is gonna be a long one. This might be like an eight hour stream.

02:46:54
<transcript>: Next column from the day I decide to move to remix.

02:46:55
<transcript>: That's funny.

02:46:55
<transcript>: kendall

02:46:58
<transcript>: Kendall Can thanks for the follow.

02:47:03
<transcript>: Yeah. So next. Yes. What do we expect today? Well, the.

02:47:06
<transcript>: Dynamic without limits.

02:47:06
<transcript>: there's the

02:47:09
<transcript>: There's the name of the conference.

02:47:17
<transcript>: I feel like they're really good at, like, keeping this stuff under wraps. What they're really gonna announce? I know, like.

02:47:17
<transcript>: i know

02:47:21
<transcript>: I know a lot of people have seen the docs. The next 13 docks.

02:47:21
<transcript>: but

02:47:22
<transcript>: But.

02:47:33
<transcript>: For as many little, like inside circles as I hang out in. I've not heard, like big talking points. What's coming? I think it's mostly gonna be like.

02:47:44
<transcript>: Server components because they've got the React team, they're doing a fact, like a realtime Q and A with React team and the next JS team. And I feel like there's gonna be a lot of emphasis on the.

02:47:44
<transcript>: server

02:47:52
<transcript>: Server components piece of it. I'm sure the layouts RFC is rolled into next 13 like that's. Probably done, I would guess.

02:47:55
<transcript>: Which Hooray.

02:47:55
<transcript>: i know

02:48:07
<transcript>: I know there's a lot more to it, but like I'm just so excited to know have my API routes if I ever use them inside of a Page's directory, that's the thing I always point out. It's so dumb to me, but my API routes are in a pages directory.

02:48:11
<transcript>: Yeah, server components.

02:48:11
<transcript>: stuff

02:48:13
<transcript>: Stuff with that.

02:48:24
laytanl_: incremental static generation?

02:48:26
<transcript>: They did the image generation thing. The Edge image generation thing was super cool. I'm surprised I didn't save that for Nick Shamp. It has me pretty hyped for the conference because that's a really cool library they put out there.

02:48:26
<transcript>: incremental

02:48:29
<transcript>: Incremental. Static regeneration.

02:48:34
<transcript>: What about it late? And I mean, they've got it. So ISR.

02:48:37
<transcript>: Is a thing.

02:48:37
<transcript>: are you saying they're

02:48:47
laytanl_: oh I thought it was experimental

02:48:47
<transcript>: Are you saying they're be changes to it? Maybe they've already moved like everything's now. Already compatible. On the edge, right. You can run API routes on the edge. You can run.

02:48:50
<transcript>: Get serverside props on the edge.

02:48:50
<transcript>: oh maybe

02:48:53
<transcript>: Oh, maybe it was experimental. Maybe some of those things.

02:48:53
<transcript>: become gs

02:49:04
<transcript>: Become GSA or something. I hate. I hate those parts of conferences. Like this thing you've been using for months is now Ga. Like I just as someone who doesn't care at all. It's something.

02:49:10
laytanl_: yeah, fair

02:49:12
<transcript>: If it's in beta, I'll use it. I'll use it in production. I don't care because I don't work on stuff that matters.

02:49:22
<transcript>: So that's always like, I can ignore all those bullet points. It's like, I guess somebody needs to get that for their Boston to be like, yeah, you can use it. I don't need that. I just use stuff.

02:49:28
<transcript>: What else? Do they have? Predictions next year? Spicy predictions.

02:49:28
<transcript>: i think

02:49:30
<transcript>: I think with the server components thing.

02:49:30
<transcript>: like will

02:49:38
<transcript>: Like will you be able to not ship client side JS at all if it's like not using any client side interactivity.

02:49:41
<transcript>: Like, can they turn it into Astro somehow.

02:49:41
<transcript>: like can

02:49:46
<transcript>: Like can they make next JS more astrolike.

02:49:55
<transcript>: I wish I wish next to I wish next JS could be decoupled from react.

02:49:55
<transcript>: i guess that's

02:49:58
<transcript>: I guess that's what Astro is.

02:50:03
<transcript>: It's like server side stuff you need the utilities you need without.

02:50:03
<transcript>: frontend

02:50:04
laytanl_: Yeah I have no idea, next looks pretty complete to me

02:50:05
<transcript>: Frontend being wrapped into that.

02:50:20
<transcript>: It's Twitch keeps telling you to remind my viewers to follow. So listen, I like when people follow me because that means you'll be back. I think it means you want to know when I'm streaming. I think.

02:50:20
<transcript>: so i do

02:50:21
<transcript>: So I do enjoy.

02:50:21
<transcript>: more followers

02:50:28
<transcript>: More followers means more people. They're gonna come hang out with me so please do follow. Thank you so much. J lohmand JLo.

02:50:33
<transcript>: No idea next looks pretty complete to me.

02:50:46
<transcript>: Yeah. I think my complaints with Next are just like I'm tired of react, and if I want to be using like if I want to play with Solid JS, I hate having to, like, venture out because I'm just so used to the Next taking care of so many things.

02:50:46
<transcript>: like

02:50:48
<transcript>: Like HMR.

02:50:48
<transcript>: it just like makes

02:50:56
<transcript>: It just like makes me not have to think about webpack. That's great. But there's so many things now that make you not have to think about webpack. Like.

02:50:56
<transcript>: not using

02:50:59
<transcript>: Not using webpack at all because you use deep.

02:51:02
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:51:02
<transcript>: i don't know

02:51:03
<transcript>: I don't know.

02:51:03
<transcript>: i have

02:51:13
<transcript>: I have some kind of like loose idea of a hot take around next JS that I can't quite form into like a coherent sentence. But it's some it's like basically.

02:51:13
<transcript>: that

02:51:19
<transcript>: That I wonder where next day s would be if there had been it's like five years ago there had been a really good.

02:51:40
<transcript>: Like front end Agnostic image component that did the right thing with images. So guessby and next year both had these really good image components that do like image optimization where you can just be like, here's an image do the right thing source set make all the sizes serve up the right one for the right client. Like that was the very helpful thing.

02:51:40
<transcript>: these the

02:51:43
nexxeln: nextjs is the modern legacy framework has been my take for a long long time

02:51:49
<transcript>: These the image component still is. But if there'd been like a third party like open source one that like just worked for any framework this image component, if that existed.

02:51:49
<transcript>: and if web passes

02:52:00
<transcript>: And if web passes weren't a disaster to work with, like if Configuring Web pack weren't the biggest nightmare in frontend development. If those two things were true, this next JS make it I don't know.

02:52:00
<transcript>: like

02:52:12
nexxeln: @adamdotdev do you want a spoiler?

02:52:19
<transcript>: Like that's. That's why I use next year the image component. And I don't want to think about webpack, so it's a better create React app with this image component built in. And I know now there's so much more and even back then like I just didn't use get serverside props like I just don't do any SSR. It's slow. Maybe it'll get better, but.

02:52:19
<transcript>: i

02:52:23
<transcript>: I do want to spoiler next you have one.

02:52:27
<transcript>: It's modern legacy framework that's such a good take.

02:52:28
thdxr: I'm BACK

02:52:31
<transcript>: Yeah. So I like.

02:52:31
<transcript>: i don't know

02:52:32
<transcript>: I don't know. I think.

02:52:34
laytanl_: What I use next for is that you can do ssg ssr and client

02:52:35
<transcript>: When I think about what is next, JS.

02:52:35
<transcript>: dax

02:52:35
nexxeln: https://web.archive.org/web/20221025105103/https://turbo.build/pack

02:52:37
<transcript>: Dax is back.

02:52:39
laytanl_: in one project

02:52:49
nexxeln: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/41776

02:52:50
<transcript>: When I use next four is that you can do SSG, SSR and client. Yeah, and one part two. And that's why I use it as a default. Like I use it for its flexibility. Like if I'm building something.

02:52:50
<transcript>: even

02:52:56
<transcript>: Even if I'm not doing anything with server side anything, I still use it just as like my default.

02:52:56
<transcript>: it's

02:52:59
laytanl_: yeah very flexible

02:53:02
<transcript>: It's my abstraction over like bundling and transpiling and all that stuff. Webpack stuff.

02:53:02
<transcript>: babel

02:53:04
<transcript>: Babel? Whatever.

02:53:09
laytanl_: easy to get going

02:53:13
<transcript>: So it's very flexible. But it's also like, I know, Theo's Talk today is next. Jess is the backend top, backend framework.

02:53:19
<transcript>: And that just stirs up all kinds of interesting thoughts for me. Like.

02:53:22
<transcript>: I just different definitions of back end framework. I think.

02:53:28
<transcript>: So next. What is this? Oh, a pull request. Ooh, OOH, OOH, what is this.

02:53:32
<transcript>: Next has read the tea leaves.

02:53:33
laytanl_: nah it isn't a backend framework

02:53:36
<transcript>: The snapberries tastes like snazberries.

02:53:42
nexxeln: look at the first link first!!

02:53:42
<transcript>: Makes ship happen. Is this like were they trying to hide it with that nothing description.

02:53:42
<transcript>: oh

02:53:46
<transcript>: Oh, they so were dynamic without limit.

02:53:46
<transcript>: web

02:53:50
<transcript>: Web pack? Who are they getting rid of? Web hack? Are they moving to Veet? What's going on.

02:54:00
estrangedhd: look last 2 commits

02:54:02
<transcript>: Oh, SWBC is SWC. Like, done. I forgot about SWC. So, like, they've got that guy Donnie, that works at Versell, just riding everything in Rust, right.

02:54:02
<transcript>: like

02:54:04
nexxeln: better than vite

02:54:05
<transcript>: Like replacing the whole tool chain with rain.

02:54:05
<transcript>: so

02:54:07
<transcript>: So like linting.

02:54:07
<transcript>: critifying

02:54:13
<transcript>: Critifying, compiling or TypeScript all of it in rust. Is that done.

02:54:13
nexxeln: at least they claim so

02:54:17
<transcript>: Is it done. A look at the last two commits.

02:54:22
<transcript>: Oh, I didn't look at the first link. The Web archive link, copy link.

02:54:22
<transcript>: oh

02:54:22
thdxr: donnie is in a depressive episode from trying to port tsc to go

02:54:25
<transcript>: Oh, this is so good. Next look at you.

02:54:32
<transcript>: The Rust powered successor to Web Pack. Oh, you found it. Oh, nice.

02:54:32
<transcript>: this

02:54:34
texoport: @thdxr sigh, yeah

02:54:34
<transcript>: This is awesome.

02:54:34
<transcript>: i love it

02:54:39
<transcript>: I love it. Turbo pack. Okay, so this is a real leak. We have a real leak here.

02:54:39
<transcript>: next

02:54:43
<transcript>: Next is on top of things. So this was published and then taken down.

02:54:46
<transcript>: Is that what I'm hearing.

02:54:48
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:54:49
laytanl_: Spoilers!

02:54:50
<transcript>: I love it.

02:54:50
<transcript>: i

02:54:55
<transcript>: I love it the way back, Machine. Okay. Turbo Pack, the Rust powered successor to webpack.

02:54:55
<transcript>: increment

02:54:58
nexxeln: theo's sub only channel :)

02:55:02
<transcript>: Incremental. Bundler optimize your JavaScript and TypeScript written and rest so that is this a rebrand of SWC.

02:55:06
<transcript>: Is this a rebrand? Oh, this is so exciting.

02:55:12
<transcript>: Danny isn't a Depressive episode.

02:55:14
<transcript>: Trying to Port Tst to go.

02:55:24
<transcript>: Spoilers people.

02:55:28
laytanl_: Damn next tooling was already fast

02:55:28
<transcript>: These are spoilers. If you don't like spoilers.

02:55:28
<transcript>: now

02:55:31
<transcript>: Now's the best time to take off.

02:55:34
cowfacedude99: his streams are too early for me :(

02:55:38
nxception: we love spoilers

02:55:41
thdxr: great now do I have to stop using esbuild in sst and use turbopack

02:55:42
cowfacedude99: I do go through the vods though

02:55:43
<transcript>: So now we've got Turbo. So are they rolling in the mono repo stuff, too? I guess Turbo is just becoming their whole build. Like you always are using Turbo repo. I love that actually.

02:55:44
nexxeln: too late for me haha @cowfacedude99

02:55:46
<transcript>: I do love Turbo repo.

02:55:46
<transcript>: faster

02:55:52
<transcript>: Faster than fast crafted by the Creator's Webpack Turbo Pack delivers unparalleled formats at scale.

02:55:52
<transcript>: cole start

02:55:54
<transcript>: Cole. Start. Wait. What.

02:55:57
nexxeln: turborepo and turbopack are gonna be different things

02:56:02
nexxeln: at least i think so

02:56:03
<transcript>: Colter. What has it affect? Cold. Sorry. I was thinking all like author time. What is the runtime implication here.

02:56:03
<transcript>: cold

02:56:05
<transcript>: Cold start.

02:56:14
<transcript>: What I was incremental behavior and Adaptable Bundling Strategies Turbo Pack provides a fast and flexible development experience of for apps of interest.

02:56:15
texoport: I really really hope Donnie can pull off creating a 10x faster Typechecker. Imagine getting an OCaml quality type checker sigh

02:56:15
cowfacedude99: @nexxeln guess you sleep very late LUL

02:56:17
<transcript>: Build once is enough work.

02:56:17
<transcript>: wants to

02:56:22
<transcript>: Wants to effect forms a task. It never does it again. I mean that's the whole turbo repo stick. Right.

02:56:31
<transcript>: Ecosystem friendly get out of the box for it for TypeScript JSX, CSS, CSS modules, WebAssembly and more lightning fast HMR say session.

02:56:32
thdxr: I don't think porting to Go is useful, it'll maybe be 2x faster and then needs to be maintained

02:56:39
thdxr: the Typerunner project seems like a better approach

02:56:40
nexxeln: nah i rarely catch his streams haha @cowfacedude99

02:56:44
<transcript>: Okay, React service components get native support for React server components when using Turbo Pack simultaneous. See, I'm not smart enough to even understand how this kind of comes into play with your React server components. Just not.

02:56:49
<transcript>: I'm trying to reach out here.

02:56:55
nexxeln: i've been there like once

02:56:57
<transcript>: next tooling was already fast

02:56:57
<transcript>: it seems too early

02:57:10
<transcript>: It seems too early for me. We love spoilers. Great. Now do I have to stop using Es build and SSD and use Turbo pack? Maybe, maybe. Dax, let's roll this into SST. I would love nothing more than to use one thing.

02:57:10
<transcript>: for

02:57:17
thdxr: everyone keeps making me do work

02:57:19
nxception: I don't get server components. Is it SSR by default or do you have to use GSSP etc?

02:57:19
<transcript>: For my cloud infrastructure with SSD and my front ends. That'd be awesome. Let's do it, let's do it, DAX. It's not even released yet. Let's do it.

02:57:21
texoport: I wish he'd used OCaml instead of Go, honestly

02:57:33
<transcript>: Too late for me. You guys are on opposite sides of the world. Turbo repo in terms of pack, are gonna be different things. Oh, I'm sorry. They're different things. I thought they were kind of rolling the monorepo support into this build stuff. At least you think so. Okay.

02:57:33
<transcript>: really hope don

02:57:35
laytanl_: @nxception me neither

02:57:39
<transcript>: Really hope Donnie can pull off creating a ten times faster type checker. Imagine getting an Okma quality type checker.

02:57:45
<transcript>: I don't think porting to go is useful. It'll maybe be two times faster and then needs to be maintained.

02:57:45
<transcript>: typewriter project

02:57:48
<transcript>: Typewriter project seems like a better approach.

02:57:49
xkarvel: you advice any content "to read" to get some random knowledge and have fun while doing it?

02:57:53
<transcript>: Everyone keeps making me do work. Sorry. Dax.

02:58:04
<transcript>: I don't get server components. Is it SSR by default? Or do you have to use Git servers or props? I know it's different. So serving different than get service. Our props.

02:58:15
cowfacedude99: I think nexxlein and me are on the same side of the world. we both are in india LUL

02:58:17
<transcript>: I wish I was smart enough to explain server components. I don't think I am, but it's like components that are fetching data on their own, but they're all running on the server end. And I think there's no hydration.

02:58:17
<transcript>: it's like it just

02:58:24
<transcript>: It's like it just rendered like there's no client stuff going on with server components. You can render it completely on the server.

02:58:24
<transcript>: and ship like

02:58:26
texoport: @cowfacedude99 same here lol

02:58:27
<transcript>: And ship like a fully formed thing. I don't know how to.

02:58:27
<transcript>: trans

02:58:31
<transcript>: Transitions into client side stuff. I don't know. That part of it.

02:58:35
<transcript>: I wish you'd use a camera. Okay.

02:58:36
nexxeln: yoo i never thought you were indian LUL

02:58:41
<transcript>: Late NOSSA doesn't get server components. Who wants to come up on stage and explain server components way better than I did.

02:58:46
<transcript>: Your advice any content to read, to get some random knowledge and have fun while doing it.

02:58:46
<transcript>: do i

02:58:52
<transcript>: Do I advise any content to read to get some random knowledge and fun while doing it. Wikipedia.

02:58:52
<transcript>: lots of random

02:58:58
<transcript>: Lots of random knowledge. I have a lot of fun reading Wikipedia articles. I don't know if that's what you're looking more.

02:59:06
ozdy: @adamdotdev bro I am a ML noobie, is it a good path to go to deeplearning.ai and do the courses?

02:59:10
<transcript>: I think next one is me are on the same side of the world. We both are in India. Oh, you're both in India. And yet you wake up and go to sleep. Oh, well, that's I mean, me and Theo both live in the us.

02:59:10
<transcript>: i think

02:59:11
ozdy: cheer10

02:59:15
<transcript>: I think I get up about when he goes to sleep. So that's just, yeah, sleep schedules. They can be very different.

02:59:22
texoport: @Ozdy fast.ai > dl.ai

02:59:33
nxception: im awake 20/24h of the day haha

02:59:35
<transcript>: Yo I never thought Uranian bro I am an Ml newbie is it good path to go deep learning AI and do the courses? I have never heard of that. Thank you so much for the tin bits texto Port says SAS AI is better than DL AI. I don't know the answer. That okay, so we're looking at some next jazz. Comp spoilers spoiler alert.

02:59:35
<transcript>: nesh

02:59:37
<transcript>: Nesha s. Comp spoilers.

02:59:40
<transcript>: I'm too excited to wait, so we're just looking at it.

02:59:40
<transcript>: let's move

02:59:46
ozdy: I thought dl ai is the most famous, will check them, out cheers @texoport

02:59:55
<transcript>: Let's move the web forward. It's time for a new beginning and compiler infrastructure for the entire Web ecosystem. Webpack has been downloaded over 3 billion times. It's become an integral part of the building for the Web. But just like Babel and Terser, it's time to go Allin on native.

02:59:58
<transcript>: Who's writing this? Tobias covers.

03:00:06
<transcript>: I joined Versell and assembled a team of world class engineers. Oh, that's the creator of Webpack. Yeah, okay.

03:00:11
<transcript>: So it's a successor to Web Pack. It's built in rust.

03:00:11
<transcript>: harness

03:00:12
delvoid: heyyoo buddy

03:00:17
thdxr: I think turbopack might write cache to disk instead of just in memory

03:00:21
<transcript>: Harness the power of our build system. Turbo Repo for many performance improvements Turbo Pack is a new foundation of high performance bare metal tooling now open source, excited to share it with you. I am so pumped.

03:00:21
<transcript>: this is

03:00:24
<transcript>: This is exciting. It really is.

03:00:24
<transcript>: jeans yeah

03:00:24
ozdy: It's the 100th successor of webpack

03:00:24
thdxr: that makes it worth it for us to switch to from esbuild

03:00:24
texoport: @Ozdy I did DL.ai when it first came out, many years ago, and it was great, but I think fast.ai is far superior

03:00:29
<transcript>: Jeans. Yeah. They're gonna get me sucked in the next JS. I thought I was leaving next shift. I really did.

03:00:29
<transcript>: i thought i was

03:00:31
<transcript>: I thought I was leaving.

03:00:31
<transcript>: they suck me back

03:00:35
<transcript>: They suck me back in Belvoid. Thank you so much for the raid.

03:00:43
laytanl_: Where would you leave to

03:00:45
<transcript>: I'm so pumped. I'm really pumped. This is. This is cool, stuff.

03:00:48
<transcript>: And I'm sure we're just gonna start with understanding.

03:00:51
<transcript>: What else is coming in next year.

03:00:51
<transcript>: next

03:00:57
<transcript>: Next 13. I mean, the build part. This is awesome, but how.

03:00:57
<transcript>: it

03:01:00
<transcript>: It gets involved with the server components I saw.

03:01:00
<transcript>: and i'm excited

03:01:03
<transcript>: And I'm excited to be explained, like, I'm five.

03:01:06
<transcript>: Code build and build from cash.

03:01:08
ozdy: @adamdotdev what are those confetti coded in? js + dom elements or video?

03:01:13
<transcript>: Crafted by the creators of Web Pack Turbo Pack delivers unparalleled performance at scale.

03:01:13
<transcript>: so

03:01:19
<transcript>: So the idea that this is literally like an open source thing that you could use. I mean, that's that's what you were saying.

03:01:19
<transcript>: you could use it for

03:01:24
ozdy: cheer10

03:01:24
<transcript>: You could use it for SST. We don't have to like use webpack anymore. Just use turbo pack.

03:01:27
<transcript>: And it doesn't have to be the next JS project.

03:01:35
<transcript>: Yeah, I did wonder like since the creator of Webpage has worked it for self or some time, like what he was up to.

03:01:35
<transcript>: i mean not

03:01:38
<transcript>: I mean not just like making improvements. Wet back apparently.

03:01:40
<transcript>: Okay.

03:01:40
<transcript>: so

03:01:41
nexxeln: i just hope there's no vendor lock in

03:01:43
<transcript>: So cold start way faster.

03:01:45
thdxr: I'm hoping this can be used to build backend function code, that's what we use esbuild for

03:01:45
<transcript>: So much faster.

03:01:49
cowfacedude99: me too.

03:01:51
<transcript>: Feels good. Let's check our models. Done. Our models done it's trained. Let's do it.

03:01:51
<transcript>: let's

03:01:53
<transcript>: Let's go.

03:01:55
estrangedhd: You can change the amount of react components to

03:01:58
<transcript>: Convert weights. Run conversion.

03:02:04
<transcript>: Oh, you can change the amount of react components. Okay, cool.

03:02:07
<transcript>: So we can play with that. I'll go back up there.

03:02:07
<transcript>: that makes

03:02:10
<transcript>: That makes it worth it for us to switch from Es, build.

03:02:15
<transcript>: Think Turbo Pack might write cash to disc instead of just in memory.

03:02:15
<transcript>: hey

03:02:19
<transcript>: Hey, o, doubled. Sorry, I'm just. I'm catching up on chat. Here.

03:02:19
<transcript>: you're awake

03:02:24
<transcript>: You're awake 20 out of 24 hours of the day Gee, you sleep 4 hours.

03:02:24
<transcript>: zeta

03:02:31
<transcript>: Zeta Gin Z thing. Are you guys able to only sleep 4 hours? I mean when I was younger, I could sleep a lot less.

03:02:31
<transcript>: i used to sleep

03:02:34
<transcript>: I used to sleep 6 hours mostly every night.

03:02:37
<transcript>: For like a year working on Stannis.

03:02:37
<transcript>: but now if

03:02:40
<transcript>: But now if I sleep 6 hours, I feel like garbage.

03:02:43
nexxeln: i sleep 6 hours too

03:02:43
<transcript>: Just getting old.

03:02:48
<transcript>: The 100 successor of what back.

03:02:49
nxception: it's not by choice. i have sleep issues haha

03:02:54
<transcript>: Where would I leave to laden like Astro and solid.

03:02:57
<transcript>: The confetti is.

03:02:57
<transcript>: it's like

03:02:58
cowfacedude99: I take 6-7 of sleep

03:03:01
<transcript>: It's like a thing. It's a browser. What is this thing.

03:03:01
<transcript>: the confetti

03:03:04
<transcript>: The Confetti. Is this thing. Ray cast.

03:03:08
<transcript>: I literally only use it for splashing confetti on my screen.

03:03:08
<transcript>: hope there's no

03:03:18
<transcript>: Hope there's no vendor lock in. Don't really start on Vinder lock in. Next we have to have vendor lock in to have good things. If you want nice things you need some vendor lock in.

03:03:18
<transcript>: i'm okay with

03:03:20
<transcript>: I'm okay with it.

03:03:20
laytanl_: I slept 3 hours on Monday, watched the new Peripheral show

03:03:24
laytanl_: pretty great

03:03:24
<transcript>: Okay. Inference. Do I need to click on this.

03:03:24
<transcript>: again

03:03:26
<transcript>: Again. I guess so.

03:03:26
<transcript>: we're gonna run everything

03:03:27
<transcript>: We're gonna run everything.

03:03:27
<transcript>: after the

03:03:34
<transcript>: After the training, just. We're gonna do it all. Let's see if this model's good. I hope it's so good. I hope we can celebrate.

03:03:36
nexxeln: there's alsp this @Ozdy https://github.com/alampros/react-confetti

03:03:37
<transcript>: Turbo Turbo pack.

03:03:37
<transcript>: with

03:03:38
<transcript>: With.

03:03:38
nexxeln: also*

03:03:39
stroopwafel26: sleeping less is not a flex

03:03:44
<transcript>: A nice gear Mo image.

03:03:47
thdxr: "I don't want to get married, I'm worried about vendor lock-in"

03:03:47
<transcript>: We'll put them in, like a race car or something. I don't know.

03:03:52
<transcript>: Run that guy. Okay. Here we go.

03:03:52
<transcript>: run

03:03:54
<transcript>: Run for generating images.

03:03:55
ozdy: @nexxeln I have coded confetti myself in pixi.js, just asking :)

03:03:55
baranoper: R u using some not standard window manager on mac ?

03:04:00
<transcript>: It should generate Game of Thrones Images here.

03:04:02
<transcript>: I hope this model's better.

03:04:04
nexxeln: @Ozdy oh cool

03:04:09
<transcript>: It's better.

03:04:09
<transcript>: it's also

03:04:11
<transcript>: It's also creepy.

03:04:15
<transcript>: And he's not in Game of Thrones.

03:04:15
<transcript>: did i do

03:04:18
<transcript>: Did I do too many steps? Is this called overfitting.

03:04:21
<transcript>: Steps.

03:04:24
<transcript>: Too many.

03:04:29
<transcript>: We over. Did it. Maybe I can change.

03:04:32
<transcript>: A Param here and get.

03:04:37
nexxeln: i prefer aws vendor lock in than vercel vendor lock in if that makes sense

03:04:39
<transcript>: Like what's it do with fortnight.

03:04:49
<transcript>: We're gonna play with these numbers and see.

03:04:50
<transcript>: And.

03:04:50
<transcript>: oh

03:04:52
thdxr: You put corporate guillermo in a vaguel medieval background

03:04:54
texoport: @nexxeln 100000% lol

03:04:55
<transcript>: Oh, I'm so sorry. In Inception, you have sleep issues.

03:05:00
<transcript>: So, 3 hours on Monday, watch the new Peripheral show.

03:05:03
ozdy: @nexxeln me too, I am very concerned with vercel's pricing once you go over their free traffic threshold, it was something absurd

03:05:09
<transcript>: React confetti. I've never heard of that. Sleeping less is not a flex. I don't want to give me married. I'm worried about vendor locking.

03:05:12
<transcript>: That's a good one. That's a good one. Dax.

03:05:13
nexxeln: exactly^^

03:05:25
<transcript>: Oh, you've coded yourself, Ozzy, that's cool. And Pixie JS welcome to Chat, Baron Opre. Are you using some some not standard window manager on Mac? I'm using you by.

03:05:37
<transcript>: Ya bye. I'll love saying you buy I prefer a to BS Vinder lock in then Versell Vinder lock in if that makes sense. Oh, it totally makes sense. You put corporate Gear mode in a Vegal medieval background.

03:05:39
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:05:45
<transcript>: Versaille pricing doesn't scale the best.

03:05:47
<transcript>: I'm with you.

03:05:57
<transcript>: Yeah, we've way over fit this model, like way over fit like that does not that does not look like Gear Mo. And it does not look like Fortnite.

03:06:00
<transcript>: Shoot.

03:06:00
<transcript>: let's

03:06:03
<transcript>: Let's try, let's try changing these numbers.

03:06:03
<transcript>: and

03:06:05
<transcript>: And just see.

03:06:10
<transcript>: My first model was better. I'm gonna be really bummed.

03:06:14
<transcript>: It's like less is more.

03:06:14
texoport: Are there a lot of large companies/platforms using Vercel?

03:06:23
<transcript>: It might be somewhere in between. Actually, because this does look more like Guillermo. It just looks exactly like the reference images. So that's not good.

03:06:27
<transcript>: We're gonna play with these numbers and see what we get.

03:06:31
thdxr: Vercel makes less money than you'd expect

03:06:32
<transcript>: Oh, they're so creepy.

03:06:36
<transcript>: I'm Candy Valley.

03:06:36
cowfacedude99: try marvel/DC?

03:06:41
<transcript>: Number of samples. Let's do let's change this to I don't know.

03:06:41
<transcript>: what happens

03:06:43
<transcript>: What happens when I do that.

03:06:47
<transcript>: Is this what machine learning people do.

03:06:54
cowfacedude99: my ML life LUL

03:06:56
stroopwafel26: @thdxr so, how's gonna buy vercel eventually?

03:06:58
ozdy: @thdxr so what, we should expect their pricing to go even higher :D ?

03:06:59
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't. Dax, I don't assume that they make a lot of money. I know. They raised a lot of money. I don't assume they make a lot of money.

03:06:59
<transcript>: i know they're

03:07:01
<transcript>: I know they're trying to charge a lot of money.

03:07:07
texoport: @thdxr Yeah, most dev tech companies don't really make too much. Same with Hasura and what not

03:07:17
<transcript>: Oh, this is so cursed. What is going on.

03:07:23
ozdy: they are also what, 100 people only?

03:07:27
<transcript>: What is happening.

03:07:32
thdxr: They're in a difficult space because theire in the middle of the market so struggle to charge large amounts

03:07:32
nxception: he's growing horns in that last pic

03:07:33
<transcript>: Oh, so I changed the number of samples it's giving me ten. That's what that is. Okay. Yeah.

03:07:33
<transcript>: well

03:07:38
<transcript>: Well, we can go back to four because these are all garbage, so we don't need ten of them.

03:07:38
<transcript>: let's

03:07:43
nexxeln: LOL

03:07:47
<transcript>: Let's go down to two, five. Then we're gonna play with the inference steps. Maybe we need more than 50. I don't know.

03:07:47
<transcript>: he's

03:07:50
<transcript>: He's growing horns. Those were Versell. Horns.

03:07:50
<transcript>: they're in a

03:07:56
<transcript>: They're in a difficult space because they're in the middle of the market, so struggle to chain to charge large amounts.

03:07:56
<transcript>: yeah i don't

03:08:00
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't I don't envy, I don't envy them.

03:08:11
<transcript>: I mean, they're winning the be super cool and have all of the developers love you as a company. They're winning that game. I just don't know how to translate stuff.

03:08:13
<transcript>: I don't know how that translates to.

03:08:17
<transcript>: Living up to their fundraising.

03:08:22
<transcript>: Listen. I have experience with fundraising and then not living up to it.

03:08:22
<transcript>: and sadie

03:08:24
thdxr: hey they haven't captured me yet

03:08:26
<transcript>: And Sadie's just doing okay. Like Stamis, eight years in.

03:08:28
<transcript>: Still kicking.

03:08:28
<transcript>: but

03:08:29
thdxr: that should be their OKR

03:08:31
nxception: its getting close PogChamp

03:08:32
thdxr: covert dax

03:08:48
<transcript>: But I know it's a lot harder to get acquired when you get overvalued, not the Versailles trying to get acquired. I'm just saying, like your exit opportunities become way less when your A valuation is maybe five times too high. Which is what happened with Stan Use we had we got valued way too high with our A. It happened when you have a corporate investor.

03:08:48
<transcript>: like a corporate

03:08:49
nexxeln: whats statmuse?

03:09:08
<transcript>: Like a corporate strategy partner. Lead your around like Disneyland a and I think they don't know as much about valuations. Maybe. I don't know. It was a competitive A round. We had a lot of people want to lead it and we got overvalued. Once you do that, your value trapped. It's very hard to exit when none of your potential acquirers view you as.

03:09:09
<transcript>: A.

03:09:09
<transcript>: x dollars

03:09:12
<transcript>: X dollars valued company.

03:09:20
<transcript>: And like they don't want to insult you. And they don't want to insult your investors by coming in well below your last valuation.

03:09:20
<transcript>: it's not fun

03:09:21
<transcript>: It's not fun.

03:09:24
<transcript>: Statmes is.

03:09:24
<transcript>: my

03:09:26
<transcript>: My startup.

03:09:26
<transcript>: use

03:09:29
<transcript>: Use. Comm. I started like eight years ago with a lifelong friend.

03:09:32
<transcript>: And this is it.

03:09:34
<transcript>: And.

03:09:34
nexxeln: this is what i learned from the silicon valley show

03:09:39
<transcript>: It's like so it started is just like searching.

03:09:39
<transcript>: just mba

03:09:40
<transcript>: Just MBA.

03:09:40
<transcript>: like

03:09:50
<transcript>: Like who has the most rebound in the season. You just ask questions like this and get answers and like charts and stuff like that.

03:09:52
<transcript>: Now it's.

03:09:52
<transcript>: it's morphed

03:09:57
<transcript>: It's morphed into a lot of other things there's, like statme's, money.

03:09:57
<transcript>: so you can search

03:09:58
nexxeln: oh wow

03:09:59
<transcript>: So you can search like stock prices.

03:10:05
<transcript>: Average price of Apple in the last four years. There's Steve jobs.

03:10:11
<transcript>: So that's what status is. It's like a search engine for sports and money.

03:10:11
<transcript>: information

03:10:12
<transcript>: Information.

03:10:12
<transcript>: so

03:10:15
<transcript>: So it answers lots of questions on like.

03:10:15
<transcript>: alex

03:10:21
<transcript>: Alexa and Google Assistant, but really the the main thing that it is is like.

03:10:21
<transcript>: an seo

03:10:27
<transcript>: An SEO King. So if you say, like who has the most sacks in the season.

03:10:37
<transcript>: Staff uses all these very hot yes, the number one like any sports stats, questions, snap Music is like the number one answer on Google. So it gets a lot of traffic.

03:10:37
<transcript>: through

03:10:41
<transcript>: Through Google for answering all these long forms.

03:10:47
nexxeln: very cool

03:10:47
<transcript>: Stats questions. Anyway, that's that means we started like eight years ago. Disney and Google invested.

03:10:54
<transcript>: And that's kind of like my main startup experience. What was it doing? I was over here.

03:11:03
<transcript>: Should be there. Okr. They haven't captured me yet. Yeah. Once I get DAX, that's their metric.

03:11:08
<transcript>: Yeah, I bet they're Burns. Not that high. Actually.

03:11:10
<transcript>: I mean.

03:11:10
<transcript>: i don't know how much

03:11:19
<transcript>: I don't know how much they're paying some of these All Stars that they hired, like what they had to pay them to bring them on board. But it's also like an effect where, oh, thanks for the follow editim overflow.

03:11:19
<transcript>: there's also

03:11:34
<transcript>: There's also an effect where, like it's kind of like in sports, when like a big free agent, or just like a player is a superstar. Other people want to come join that organization. So Versaille now has this momentum. And it's shown up in all the Nexus Conference pictures, like.

03:11:34
<transcript>: they

03:11:36
<transcript>: They there's an attraction.

03:11:36
<transcript>: quality to that

03:11:42
<transcript>: Quality to that everyone wants to be involved because they've amass this crazy team.

03:11:42
<transcript>: that's like

03:11:45
<transcript>: That's like all these all stars.

03:11:51
stroopwafel26: gotta go, going to pick up my daughter a little earlier than usual because it's her bday today

03:11:52
<transcript>: So that helps them. I'm sure they're probably not having to pay super competitive salaries.

03:11:52
<transcript>: but they do

03:11:55
stroopwafel26: see ya!

03:11:57
<transcript>: But they do have a lot of really senior people. I don't know. I'd be curious what their Burns like.

03:11:57
<transcript>: and what they're

03:12:03
<transcript>: And what they're Runway is like, and what all they're gonna do is that cash. Besides throw really cool conferences.

03:12:06
<transcript>: See a Stroop.

03:12:10
<transcript>: This is what I learned from The Silicon Valley show.

03:12:18
<transcript>: Okay. So.

03:12:18
<transcript>: so our model

03:12:21
nexxeln: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/6d7ed727073a0e3b0731c0dd9cc325945d024e99

03:12:22
nexxeln: merged

03:12:24
<transcript>: So our model. What's wrong with our model? It's bad for one. These don't look at all like.

03:12:24
<transcript>: so we

03:12:29
<transcript>: So we overfit it, right? We just overfit it. We did too many training samples.

03:12:34
<transcript>: The closest thing that looks like Fortnite. Looks. Nothing.

03:12:34
<transcript>: nice

03:12:35
<transcript>: Nice.

03:12:42
<transcript>: Oh, we didn't try to change.

03:12:42
<transcript>: so let's

03:12:45
<transcript>: So let's go back to seven, five on this.

03:12:45
<transcript>: and then

03:12:48
<transcript>: And then number of inference sets. What happens when you double it.

03:12:59
<transcript>: Just learning here. I don't think we're gonna I think the model's too bad. I don't think we're gonna really squeeze that much from these inference level params. But we're trying.

03:12:59
<transcript>: so i'm gonna

03:13:05
<transcript>: So I'm gonna stop from trying because it's a lot faster than training a new model. We're gonna train it a new model.

03:13:08
<transcript>: I wonder if I should do far fewer of the man.

03:13:11
<transcript>: The class images.

03:13:11
texoport: Nextjs has always been very meh when it comes to anything that doesn't need SSR or SEO performance. Vite seems to work far better for me. I feel like the segment of the market that actually needs SSR for the money making part of the business but doesn't want to make hand roll their own solution is relatively small.

03:13:16
<transcript>: So cursed. It's just so it looks so scary.

03:13:24
<transcript>: That's the closest we've gotten. So that's the closest we've gotten to, like, Gearmo. And another context holding what looks like.

03:13:28
<transcript>: A typewriter mix with some kind of a weapon.

03:13:33
<transcript>: Okay. Let's. Let's.

03:13:50
nexxeln: i use nextjs so that i can use trpc

03:13:51
<transcript>: I'm just gonna make sure we since we made such a it's a much larger number of training steps. Maybe we need to also disproportionately or proportionately increase the inference steps. So if we did, the original model was 800 steps. We increased that.

03:13:51
<transcript>: four

03:13:52
<transcript>: Fourfold.

03:13:52
<transcript>: no

03:14:01
texoport: I use React and Vite with tRPC, works great

03:14:02
<transcript>: No to 6000 steps 36,000. I think 6000. So 800 goes into 6000. What? How many times some of the math? I don't know. Math is hard.

03:14:02
<transcript>: carry the

03:14:06
<transcript>: Carry the one. What would that be? Roughly.

03:14:06
<transcript>: seven

03:14:10
texoport: I used it far before create-t3-app was a thing xD

03:14:15
<transcript>: Seven. Eight times. Eight times eight to see. Yeah. So seven and a half. So we need to multiply 100, but this is like 750. Let's try it.

03:14:18
<transcript>: This works.

03:14:18
<transcript>: i'm a genius

03:14:19
<transcript>: I'm a genius.

03:14:19
nexxeln: so like express and vite monorepo?

03:14:21
<transcript>: If it doesn't.

03:14:22
texoport: Yeah

03:14:26
<transcript>: Still genius. I just know it's not gonna work.

03:14:26
<transcript>: not gonna

03:14:28
<transcript>: Not gonna work.

03:14:28
<transcript>: what was

03:14:30
<transcript>: What was merged next shift.

03:14:30
<transcript>: what was me

03:14:32
nexxeln: never tried it that way tbh

03:14:35
<transcript>: What was merged? Copylink. Next, send us another PR.

03:14:40
<transcript>: Version 13.

03:14:42
<transcript>: Merged.

03:14:45
<transcript>: Look at this.

03:14:49
<transcript>: It's getting real next 13.

03:14:49
<transcript>: coming soon

03:14:51
<transcript>: Coming soon coming today.

03:14:58
thdxr: I only ever use vite

03:14:58
<transcript>: Next year has always been very mad when it comes to anything that doesn't need SSR or SEO performance.

03:14:58
<transcript>: v seems

03:15:07
laytanl_: BRB using next13 in production

03:15:09
<transcript>: V seems to work far better for me. I feel like the segment of the market actually needs SSR for the moneymaking part of the business but doesn't want to make hand roll their own solutions relatively small.

03:15:09
<transcript>: i use

03:15:21
<transcript>: I use next year so I can use CrPC. I use React and V with your PC. Works great. I used it before create two, three app as a thing. So like Express and V monorepo. Yeah, never tried it. Okay. I'm just reading.

03:15:21
<transcript>: i

03:15:24
thdxr: also next competitors like SolidStart and SvelteKit are built on top of the Vite SSR framework

03:15:30
<transcript>: I only ever use Veet, says DAX BRB using X 13 in production. You don't need an explanation latent. You're just using it.

03:15:30
<transcript>: signing up

03:15:32
<transcript>: Signing up.

03:15:41
thdxr: vercel creating mroe of an island

03:15:41
<transcript>: So neither solidstore norsevelt kit or even close to done right like.

03:15:44
<transcript>: Somehow next is still.

03:15:48
nexxeln: vite-ssr-plugin

03:15:53
nexxeln: solid start is in beta

03:15:54
<transcript>: Creating more of an island. Dax, what do you mean? Oh, like going their own, not being built on top of eat.

03:15:57
thdxr: yeah

03:15:58
<transcript>: I mean, they built their own thing, right.

03:15:58
<transcript>: they built

03:16:00
<transcript>: They built turbo pack.

03:16:05
<transcript>: I wonder if anyone else uses.

03:16:05
<transcript>: turbo

03:16:13
<transcript>: Turbo Pack if anyone switches over from Vet to Turbo Pack in the open source community, I'm curious. Will it happen? What do we think.

03:16:14
thdxr: SvelteKit release candidate is out I think

03:16:20
<transcript>: Oh smoke is in has a release candidate interesting.

03:16:20
<transcript>: interesting

03:16:25
<transcript>: Interesting. I should put in the show title. Here the stream.

03:16:25
<transcript>: that

03:16:29
<transcript>: That we're gonna do next? Js. Conf. Watch party.

03:16:31
<transcript>: Playing with Dream booth.

03:16:35
<transcript>: Oh, Geez, what did I do.

03:16:40
<transcript>: Dream booth.

03:16:41
texoport: Vite is already so fast for builds, I don't know how much of a difference it's going to make

03:16:43
<transcript>: And talking.

03:16:43
thdxr: SolidStart beta at the end of the month I think

03:16:45
<transcript>: Next desktop.

03:16:50
<transcript>: Make sure people know they can come here.

03:16:50
<transcript>: for the next

03:16:55
<transcript>: For the next JS conversation. Alright. What do we got? That looks more like Jared Palmer.

03:17:03
<transcript>: And that looks like Gear Mo. Not in Fortnite.

03:17:03
<transcript>: okay

03:17:03
thdxr: @texoport yeah and SWC is slower than esbuild so that's why I've never been that into it

03:17:09
<transcript>: Okay, new model. Its new model time. Our model is bad and we need a new model.

03:17:09
<transcript>: i'm gonna start a training

03:17:11
texoport: That being said, I would sell my soul for a fast typechecker

03:17:17
<transcript>: I'm gonna start a training sesh training session here. And then I got taken to the brakes. I got to pee again because I'm like Dax's puppy. I have to pee a lot.

03:17:20
<transcript>: Train Batch Size one.

03:17:20
<transcript>: we're gonna

03:17:22
thdxr: @texoport https://github.com/marcj/TypeRunner

03:17:25
<transcript>: We're gonna drop this number of class images down to 150.

03:17:25
<transcript>: sample

03:17:29
<transcript>: Sample batch size. We're gonna say Max train steps.

03:17:33
<transcript>: Save interval sure.

03:17:33
<transcript>: here we

03:17:35
texoport: @texoport Yeah, I looked at it.

03:17:36
<transcript>: Here we go. We're training. I got a P.

03:17:38
<transcript>: I'll be right back.

03:18:12
texoport: The guy marcj is insanely impressive lol

03:18:16
texoport: I was looking at Deepkit the other day

03:18:17
thdxr: yeah

03:19:07
texoport: And fwiw I think C++ is probably a better bet for a type checker than Go any day

03:19:39
texoport: I was looking at C++20 and it's getting surprisingly expressive

03:22:36
<transcript>: Just reading catching up on chat.

03:22:40
<transcript>: Deep kit.

03:22:45
nexxeln: new package https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/font

03:22:48
oetziofficial: hello 👋

03:22:54
<transcript>: You lost me. Oh, next, with more leaks.

03:22:57
<transcript>: Letsy's here hey, let's see.

03:22:57
<transcript>: so before

<transcript>: So before I'm gonna open this up, we're gonna look at this leak. Spoilers. Set up. Spoilers. Next. Jf. Comp.

<transcript>: spoilers

03:23:16
<transcript>: Spoilers on this stream you will you will be spoiled with the spoilers before I do I record a teaser every time I go live you all know this.

03:23:16
<transcript>: that

03:23:20
<transcript>: That follow me. So I post like a thing on Twitter.

03:23:20
<transcript>: a little

03:23:22
<transcript>: A little video.

03:23:28
<transcript>: This totally random about whatever. I feel like making a video about that day. Usually something topical.

03:23:28
<transcript>: today

03:23:29
<transcript>: Today.

03:23:29
<transcript>: i did

03:23:30

03:23:32
<transcript>: I did one, but I don't think you.

03:23:32
<transcript>: 're not

03:23:36
<transcript>: 're not a single soul understood? And I spent, like, 45 minutes rehearsing.

03:23:36
<transcript>: this line

03:23:40
thdxr: I had no idea what your teaser was today

03:23:43
<transcript>: This line. I mean this little like dialogue. I was gonna do it was this Biden clip. Where.

03:23:43
<transcript>: yeah

03:23:44
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:23:44
<transcript>: so bi

03:23:46
laytanl_: yeah i had no idea

03:23:49
thdxr: I watched it twice

03:23:50
<transcript>: So Biden was asked, what do you think it's like? What do you think of your.

03:23:50
thdxr: oh lol

03:23:52
<transcript>: Mental.

03:23:55
<transcript>: Acuity or your mental focus or something.

03:23:55
<transcript>: and that

03:23:58
laytanl_: @thdxr same lol

03:24:01
<transcript>: And that was his response. And like, I got the timing exact. I mean, I'm telling you, I rehearsed this in so much.

03:24:11
thdxr: when in doubt assume it's biden

03:24:16
<transcript>: So just look at that Biden mental focus. Look that up. You'll see Biden do and play it with me saying it and tell me how well I nailed it because I nailed it. I've watched it like, 50 times because it cracks me up.

03:24:20
<transcript>: Assume it's Biden. Yeah, I think it's the first bite joke I've made.

03:24:23
<transcript>: Mui thanks for the follow.

03:24:28
<transcript>: All Right. Next. Jskom. Spoilers coming up. Here we go.

03:24:28
<transcript>: spoilers

03:24:31
<transcript>: Spoilers Spoiler alert.

03:24:33
nexxeln: "biden ain't got no merch"

03:24:38
texoport: BRING OUT THE SPOILERS

03:24:51
<transcript>: A new package Font Next Font includes builtin automatic selfhosting for any font file. This means you can optimally load Web fonts with zero layout shift thanks to the underlying CSS size adjust property. Use this new font system also allows you to conveniently use all Google fonts with performance and Privacy. Mind CSS.

03:24:51
<transcript>: and pop

03:25:01
<transcript>: And pop files are downloaded at build time and selfhosted. Oh, my word. I love it. I love this. You know how much time I spend doing font stuff? Every time I want to add a font.

03:25:01
<transcript>: too much

03:25:03
<transcript>: Too much time Way too much time.

03:25:03
<transcript>: clause on a self

03:25:07
<transcript>: Clause on a selfhost. I always want optimal everything. And now.

03:25:07
<transcript>: they did

03:25:08
teej_dv: AHAHA THAT FOCUS VIDEO

03:25:22
oetziofficial: hi Teej bashLove kruzChaos

03:25:24
texoport: omg teej

03:25:25
<transcript>: They did it. They just. They brushed over all the rough edges. We don't have to think about anymore. They already had, like, fonts optimization, but that was just, like, automatically preloading. If you use a Google font or something, they detect the script tag. I don't know. This sounds way better. Sounds way more like batteries included. Use a Google font.

03:25:25
<transcript>: everything's done

03:25:27
nexxeln: hi teej

03:25:29
<transcript>: Everything's done for you selfhosted.

03:25:29
<transcript>: sounds

03:25:30
<transcript>: Sounds amazing.

03:25:34
<transcript>: Teach the Focus video.

03:25:38
teej_dv: o/ chat

03:25:41
thdxr: I use @fontsource/** not sure if this does something more

03:25:42
<transcript>: Did you understand it? Teenagers? Are you the first human being on Earth that understood that reference? Because I'm pretty sure nobody understood it.

03:25:54
<transcript>: But I spent I just I just explained that I spent, like, 30, 45 minutes rehearsing, like I literally I practiced that live got it written on my teleprompter still.

03:25:56
<transcript>: Oh, it's focus.

03:25:57
itsboek: Is it me looking at same day flights to SF?

03:25:58
teej_dv: OH ITS FOCUSED

03:26:00
oetziofficial: @thdxr same

03:26:06
<transcript>: I say is, I think it's I haven't looked. I have trouble. Okay? I recursed it so much to myself just to get it right. You know, I'm saying.

03:26:07
teej_dv: oh yes

03:26:09
<transcript>: And then no one understood the reference.

03:26:09
<transcript>: so there's

03:26:15
<transcript>: So there's that sometimes you do things for yourself, you know, sometimes you just do stuff because you want to do it.

03:26:15
texoport: @thdxr yeah, fontsource is pog

03:26:16
laytanl_: Probably because most of us are not in the US

03:26:26
<transcript>: So Tees, we've been leaking. We're talking about leaks for Nextdes Conf. Do you get excited about Next Desk config as somebody that cares nothing about JavaScript.

03:26:27
laytanl_: Not really caught up with biden

03:26:28
<transcript>: Probably not right.

03:26:30
teej_dv: well if you had it written on your teleprompter, you probably should have read it wrong for it to be more authentic LUL

03:26:33
<transcript>: Font source.

03:26:33
<transcript>: i

03:26:36
<transcript>: I use font source not sure if this does something more.

03:26:36
<transcript>: well

03:26:41
<transcript>: Well, there's I guess font source like hosts your fonts in your node modules.

03:26:46
<transcript>: Sounds bad. Sounds bad. Dax. No, I think it's actually good. I don't know.

03:26:49
<transcript>: Is it me.

03:26:53
<transcript>: Looking the same day slice to SF seriously the FOMO.

03:26:53
teej_dv: i am just sad that all my friends are there without me LUL

03:26:58
<transcript>: Painting me paint. Painting me hurting me so much pain.

03:26:58
<transcript>: our model's done

03:27:01
<transcript>: Our model's done training. Let's look at it.

03:27:01
<transcript>: probably because

03:27:06
<transcript>: Probably because most of us are not in the US. Not really caught up with Biden. Yeah, that makes sense.

03:27:06
<transcript>: that checks out

03:27:12
oetziofficial: turbopack xhimelIliciouswuat xhimelIliciouswuat

03:27:14
<transcript>: That checks out. If you had written it on your teleprompter, you probably should have read it wrong for it to be more authentic. Oh, that's a good point. Yeah.

03:27:14
<transcript>: i'm just that all my friends

03:27:14
thdxr: what sucks is none of the people at nextjs conf are going to have fomo about re:invent

03:27:16
itsboek: It’s only 90 minutes from Portland. Faster than commuting from South Bay 🤣

03:27:17
oetziofficial: whuuut

03:27:21
<transcript>: I'm just that all my friends are there without me exactly. Peach. Everyone's there like everyone but you teach.

03:27:22
nexxeln: my aim for 2023 is to give a talk at some conf

03:27:24
<transcript>: I didn't expect you to be there.

03:27:33
<transcript>: Given its JavaScript. But then again, they got primed to go. Prime didn't even know next was Diddy I mean, Theo had to explain to him.

03:27:41
<transcript>: Turbo pack. This is coming, people. It's a leak. I feel bad. I'm leaking. I hope no one's offended, but you know what? The conference starts in like 3 hours.

03:27:41
<transcript>: is that

03:27:44
teej_dv: like WHY IS PRIME THERE

03:27:48
<transcript>: Is that right? Three out. I keep messing up the time. 3 hours, three minutes. We're doing it. We're watching it here together.

03:27:48
<transcript>: i can't i can't wait

03:27:49
teej_dv: exactly

03:27:53
<transcript>: I can't I can't wait. I'm so excited. I get so hyped up about new stuff.

03:27:57
<transcript>: Let's look at our model has our Girmo model looking.

03:28:00
<transcript>: Kuda air Oh.

03:28:00
<transcript>: what i

03:28:02
<transcript>: What I do wrong.

03:28:08
<transcript>: I did something wrong. The following values were not bad. To avoid this warning.

03:28:08
<transcript>: step

03:28:10
<transcript>: Steps file.

03:28:16
<transcript>: One DNN custom operations are on you may see slight different numerical results.

03:28:19
<transcript>: What is the error.

03:28:21
texoport: I wonder if Prime is planning on going up on stage, just to say "this sucks, why would you do this to yourself?"

03:28:26
<transcript>: Steps zero. It failed right away. Kudaera.

03:28:26
<transcript>: when

03:28:29
<transcript>: When calling is something with my GPU. Is something wrong.

03:28:31
<transcript>: Manage the.

03:28:34
<transcript>: Gpu.

03:28:34
<transcript>: let's

03:28:40
<transcript>: Let's just try it again. I don't think there's anything wrong with what I just put. What did I do? I changed.

03:28:43
<transcript>: We went to.

03:28:43
<transcript>: one hundred and fifty

03:28:45
<transcript>: 150 of the Class images.

03:28:49
<transcript>: And I changed train steps to 2000.

03:28:49
<transcript>: i see

03:28:56
<transcript>: I see no problems here. I think it was an issue with getting the GPU, maybe getting access to it.

03:28:56
<transcript>: these

03:28:59
<transcript>: These notebooks. They're not perfect.

03:29:01
oetziofficial: primeagenF

03:29:17
<transcript>: What sex is. None of the people it actually has comp are going to have FOMO about Reinvent. Yeah, exactly. Tax, we're going to the Nerd conference like me and actually gonna hang out at Reinvent. We don't even care. We'll do something fun. It's Vegas. That's only 990 minutes for Portland. Faster than community from South Bay.

03:29:25
<transcript>: My Aunt Aim for 2023 is to give a talk at some conference. You'll do it next, you will definitely do it. Like Why is prime there exactly.

03:29:29
<transcript>: This sucks.

03:29:42
<transcript>: I mean props to Versail for understanding Dev culture, and like getting on the right trains. I mean they miss the teach train, but like they know prime has a certain.

03:29:42
<transcript>: pull

03:29:43
thdxr: I'm speaking at React Miami I hope people come

03:29:57
tayloreddev: He's going to annouce his transition to vscode LUL

03:30:02
<transcript>: I'm sure that'll be well attended, but I've never seen a conference like next shift off this year. I feel like.

03:30:05
<transcript>: The pictures I'm seeing.

03:30:05
<transcript>: just

03:30:08
<transcript>: Just it's a lot of people there.

03:30:12
<transcript>: Okay. So we broke something. What did we break.

03:30:18
<transcript>: We have maybe we should try fewer class images. I don't know. We were doing more than this a minute ago.

03:30:24
<transcript>: Let's do 50 of them. Let's do a thousand train steps just trying to get a working.

03:30:27
nexxeln: is miami as fun as they show it in tv?

03:30:28

03:30:31
texoport: look at the bottom of the stack trace aaaa

03:30:39
thdxr: miami is fun because it's actually nothing like what they show on tv

03:30:41
<transcript>: What is going on.

03:30:47
<transcript>: And how does this transition to vs. Code.

03:30:47

vim_cerf: LUL

03:35:04

03:35:04
<transcript>: i

03:35:11
oetziofficial: Biden has not even made a full sentence

03:35:14
<transcript>: I no more think of myself as being old, as think of myself as being able to fly. I think I think that's what I think. That's what he meant. I don't think it's about someone named fly.

03:35:18
<transcript>: This is so bad.

03:35:23
teej_dv: yes, that's the only possible interpretation that makes sense

03:35:28
dnbull: ugh... this always reminds me why we have old balls running the country LUL

03:35:30
laytanl_: "Being fly" means being cool right?

03:35:30
<transcript>: That sentence hurts my brain so bad.

03:35:32
teej_dv: but I wouldn't call the sentence.... focused LUL

03:35:39
<transcript>: There's there's not things I don't do now that I did before I had to like, slow down there's not things I don't do.

03:35:43
<transcript>: now

03:35:44
laytanl_: Its just a ramble LUL

03:35:46
thdxr: I see why this took 45min to recreate

03:35:47
teej_dv: just shows how advanced he is compared to you LUL

03:35:49
<transcript>: Now that I did before. Okay. So I think a better sense would be like.

03:35:54
<transcript>: I can still do everything I once did. I don't know.

03:35:54
<transcript>: just

03:35:57
<transcript>: Just as bad. It's real bad.

03:36:06
<transcript>: You see why I took 40 Ministry. Yeah. Trying to recreate. This is like every time you think of what the next word should be, it's not the word you think it would be.

03:36:06
<transcript>: it was a while

03:36:09
<transcript>: It was a while. Took a lot of practice.

<transcript>: What's the least annoying way to read CSVs? And no JS. I think there's a builtin thing in nojs. Isn't there for reading CFCs? I think I've done. I've asked this question several times and like ended up not using a library because there's something built in. Maybe not. Maybe there is a good library. I don't know.

nexxeln: i will move on once solid start is ready

03:46:18
<transcript>: Yeah, teachers considering it.

03:46:24
thdxr: wow literally never expected to see a Fable reference

03:46:25
<transcript>: If they got TJ and prime, there would be no stopping for sale, just no stopping them.

03:46:30
teej_dv: for the right price and the right lang of course

03:46:33
oetziofficial: i will miss getServerSideProps BibleThump

03:46:34
<transcript>: Where? Move on. Great question, Tray. I've really been like.

03:46:34
<transcript>: i

03:46:39
<transcript>: I six on Astro and solid JS. That's kind of where I've been.

03:46:39
<transcript>: thinking

03:46:46
<transcript>: Thinking. I want to move over to mostly just to, like, do something nonreact for a while. I think Zach does it.

03:46:50
<transcript>: For the right price and right leg. Now we're talking Tiege.

03:46:59
texoport: @thdxr I haven't done too much Fable, but  I was really excited by F# type providers

03:47:00
<transcript>: F sharp. Plus, fable is the way to go. I don't know what fable is, but I've done some F sharp in my day. I'll move on when Solid Start is ready. Interesting.

03:47:00
<transcript>: liter

03:47:04
<transcript>: Literally never expected to see a fable reference.

03:47:08
<transcript>: You Miss Git server Side Props hey, OS.

03:47:13
thdxr: SolidStart is ready! (sortof)

03:47:13
laytanl_: Can nextjs be deployed on aws?

03:47:16
<transcript>: Get service eye props is slow up there. I said it. No, I don't know. I mean, it's slow when it's not on the edge for sure.

03:47:21
laytanl_: or anywhere but vercel?

03:47:24
<transcript>: I'm just generally found API wraps and get serverside props to be underwhelming from a performance standpoint.

03:47:24
<transcript>: okay

03:47:29
nexxeln: yeah

03:47:31
<transcript>: Okay. I just leaked my token. Cool. Now we've done this. This step. Now we're gonna do this. Save the G drive.

03:47:34
laytanl_: (easily)

03:47:34
<transcript>: Okay.

03:47:35
oetziofficial: why is it slow? primeagenF

03:47:42
treflxyz: where is the link to this turbo rust thing?

03:47:43
<transcript>: Solid start is ready, says DAX. Sort of.

03:47:48
<transcript>: Connects us be deployed on AWS. It can lighten it can.

03:47:49
nexxeln: yeah pretty straightforward @laytanl_

03:47:53
<transcript>: Anywhere but Versail? Yeah, so there's.

03:47:58
nexxeln: just need to write a Dockerfule

03:48:02
<transcript>: What's the other company Netlify they've done like, I feel like now if I've built more features for Next JS the deployments than Versaille lately.

03:48:02
<transcript>: they've got some cool stuff

03:48:03
<transcript>: They've got some cool stuff.

03:48:03
<transcript>: accuse

03:48:07
<transcript>: Accuse somehow you can have like API routes that are queued.

03:48:07
<transcript>: i don't know

03:48:12
<transcript>: I don't know. Sounds kind of cool, but also while we're leaking stuff.

03:48:12
<transcript>: a little

03:48:15
<transcript>: A little inside baseball on the AWS front.

03:48:15
<transcript>: we're gonna

03:48:26
<transcript>: We're gonna deploy to AWS if you don't mind amplify managed hosting the ability to deploy all the latest next best features on your A to BS account using that.

03:48:28
<transcript>: So.

03:48:31
<transcript>: Options. We got out options. People.

03:48:36
<transcript>: Why is it slow.

03:48:38
nexxeln: firebase recently release nextjs hosting as well

stephensaggyball: I only use web assembly

03:48:42
<transcript>: I don't know. Oh, Etsy. I think like if it's I'm assuming Bracell deploys.

03:48:42
<transcript>: like i

03:48:48
<transcript>: Like I'm assuming your get service that Props is running within a Lambda function. That's just my assumption about the underlying infrastructure.

03:48:48
<transcript>: i know

03:48:49
texoport: @nexxeln wait, what?

03:48:52
<transcript>: I know they're built on top AWS, but I know they use other things other CDNS I don't know.

03:49:01
<transcript>: I'm assuming though at the end of the day, your get server size props code. Your next JS code is running in a Lambda function, and my guess is.

03:49:01
<transcript>: it's just too bl

03:49:08
<transcript>: It's just too bloated. There's too much stuff next to us is too big. And that leads to the cold starts and the slowness that goes, our props.

03:49:10
<transcript>: In my experience.

03:49:10
<transcript>: it felt very

03:49:18
<transcript>: It felt very slow. I don't use it. I don't know. That's why I do like everything ISR if I'm gonna do server side generation.

03:49:25
<transcript>: The link to the turbo resting should we share the link.

03:49:25
<transcript>: next we

03:49:27
<transcript>: Next we reserve it.

03:49:27
<transcript>: oh fine

03:49:28
<transcript>: Oh, fine.

03:49:28
<transcript>: i didn't know

03:49:30
<transcript>: I didn't know you could do.

03:49:30
<transcript>: oh it recently

03:49:34
<transcript>: Oh, it recently released next year. So as well. There you go. There's three places.

03:49:45
<transcript>: For frontend Dev is hard. Take AWS certification.

03:49:45
<transcript>: is it hard

03:49:47
<transcript>: Is it hard to take a certification.

03:49:51
<transcript>: I mean, it depends on how much you like taking tests and.

03:49:56
<transcript>: Okay. What do I need to do here? I need to change this.

03:49:59
texoport: We're a GCP house for now, so I've been using Firebase hosting just because it's surprisingly convenient

03:50:00
<transcript>: As depends on how much you like if you enjoy.

03:50:02
<transcript>: Test taking like I do.

03:50:02

03:54:21
<transcript>: with

03:54:22

03:54:30
<transcript>: Ready to go full turbo.

03:54:35
thdxr: why compete with vite :(

03:54:39
<transcript>: Okay, we'll read this in a second. Let's go back to our.

03:54:42
<transcript>: Is it training.

03:54:42
<transcript>: is it working

03:54:43
<transcript>: Is it working.

03:54:45
thdxr: oh what's the vite section

03:54:48
<transcript>: Summit got one step in.

03:54:48
<transcript>: i think the deposit

03:54:50
<transcript>: I think the Deposit Dirk Eichels.

03:54:55
caldotjs: this is related to turborepo right? I assumed smth regarding to that would be in this nextconf after their acquisition

03:54:57
thdxr: what's the turbopack url

03:54:57
<transcript>: Trech change the amount of react components. Oh, yeah, we will. Turbo Bag is currently an Alpha. Yeah.

03:54:59
<transcript>: Why Compete with Veet.

03:55:09
<transcript>: Oh, there's a Veet section. We'll read that I didn't see that related to Turbo repo. Right? Assumed something regarding to that would be in the next half after the acquisition.

03:55:13
<transcript>: Apparently. Oh, man, this is still failing. Apparently.

03:55:19
<transcript>: They're still separate. Turbo pack and turbo repo are separate. What's going on here.

03:55:24
<transcript>: Do I need to just go back to the default setting? Let's just if I use the Daunt. Does it work.

03:55:25
nexxeln: https://turbo.build/pack/docs/why-turbopack

03:55:29
<transcript>: I don't know why that would matter. We're not even doing a single step before it's failing.

03:55:38
<transcript>: Yeah. Let's read these. So why Turbo pack.

03:55:38
<transcript>: we start

03:55:41
<transcript>: We start to create tripod back. We want to solve problems.

03:55:41
<transcript>: working

03:55:43
<transcript>: Working on speed improves for next year.

03:55:49
<transcript>: Back babble gone tertiagon.

03:55:49
<transcript>: our

03:55:52
texoport: Pytorch bug probably RIP. Doesn't seem to be out of memory or whatever

03:55:54
<transcript>: Our next target was another JSpace. Tool Webback replacing a becomeer goal. But with what.

03:55:54
<transcript>: a new gener

03:55:58
<transcript>: A new generation of native speed bundlers were emerging like Es Build and.

03:56:02
<transcript>: After assessing the bundlers on the market, we decided to build our own why.

03:56:02
<transcript>: bund

03:56:15
<transcript>: Bundling versus native ESM OOH frameworks like V use a technique where they don't bundle application source code and development mode said they rely on the browser's native vs. Module system. This approach resulting in incredibly responsive updates, since they only have to transform a single file.

03:56:15
<transcript>: however

03:56:17
<transcript>: However.

03:56:17
<transcript>: ve

03:56:25
thdxr: ohh because vite uses rollup for bundling which is slow

03:56:32
thdxr: they're tlaking about bundling for prod vs local dev

03:56:37
<transcript>: Veet can hit scaling issues with large applications made up of many modules. A flood of Cascading network requests in the browser can lead to a relatively slow startup time. The browser it's faster. If you can receive the code it needs in as few network requests as possible, even on a local server. Makes sense. That's why we decided that like Webpack, we want to Turbo back to bundle the code in the development server. Turbo Pack can do it much faster.

03:56:37
<transcript>: especially for

03:56:45
<transcript>: Especially for larger applications, because it's written in rust, because it's written in rust and skip optimization work that is only necessary for production.

03:56:52
<transcript>: Incremental computation. Two ways to make a process faster, do less work or do work in parallel. We knew if we wanted to make the bundle faster.

03:56:52
<transcript>: we need to

03:56:55
<transcript>: We need to pull hard on both levers.

03:56:55
<transcript>: reusable

03:56:58
<transcript>: Reusable Turbo Build Engine distributing.

03:57:04
<transcript>: Turbo engine I'll show caches roll the function schedules like this sounds so much like turbo repo to me.

03:57:11
<transcript>: It never needs the same word. Twice. Doesn't minimum work at maximum speed? That's very much the turbo repo velocity. Right.

03:57:11
<transcript>: ve

03:57:31
<transcript>: Vet tools take a different attitude to doing less work. The minimizes work done by using Native ESM and development mode. We decide not to take this approach for the reason listed above. Out of the Hood uses Espill for minitask Es build is a bungler, a superbly, fast one. It doesn't force you to use native ESM, but we decided not to adopt yes build for a few reasons.

03:57:38
<transcript>: Espill's code is hyperoptimized for one task bundling fast. It does not have HMR, which we don't want to lose from our Dev server.

03:57:38
<transcript>: es build

03:57:41
texoport: "because it's written in Rust" is too memey of a reason though, when you're comparing it to Go

03:57:58
<transcript>: Es Build is an extremely fast bundler, but it doesn't do much caching. This means you will end up doing the same work again and again, even if that work is at the speed of native. Evan Wallace refers to Es Build as a proof of concept for the next generation of bundlers. We think he's right. We feel that a Rust power bundler with incremental computation could perform better at a larger scale than Es build. Woo.

03:58:03
<transcript>: That's a lot of words. I just said lots of words.

03:58:06
thdxr: I do like the incremental stuff

03:58:14
thdxr: can be good for speeding up sst builds for functions

03:58:17
<transcript>: Pytorch bug probably ripped doesn't seem to be out of memory or whatever. Yeah. What's going on? We had this working just a little bit ago, right? Because Beat uses roll up for bundling, which is slow. We're talking about bundling for prod versus local Dev.

03:58:21
<transcript>: Two memey of a reason though when you're comparing it to go.

03:58:25
<transcript>: Lazy, bundling.

03:58:33
<transcript>: Earlier versions of Next Chest. Try to bundle the entire Web app in development mode. We Cook and realize this eager approach was less than optimal.

03:58:38
<transcript>: Lazy approach okay makes sense summary.

03:58:38
<transcript>: we wanted

03:58:50
<transcript>: We wanted to build a bundler bundlers app form native VSM. When working on large applications use incremental computation. The turbo engine brings into the core of Torah vaccine architecture, maximizing speed to minimizing work done.

03:58:50
<transcript>: optimize

03:58:59
<transcript>: Optimize our Dev servers startup time for that, we build a lazy asset graph to compute only assets for presence. That's why we chose to build Turbo Pack. Okay.

03:59:07
nexxeln: adam don't refresh the page!!

03:59:08
<transcript>: You can import TS files with Turbo Pack. We support all of TypeScript features. Thanks for JSX support. You can also import TSX files.

03:59:11
texoport: @thdxr has SST been good for you?

03:59:25
<transcript>: They use SWBC to compile type script code, which also does not form type checks, means in order to run your type text, you'll need to sign car process running TSD watch so nothing changed. There.

03:59:28
<transcript>: Nothing changed. There.

04:00:00

04:00:05

04:00:10
texoport: oh damn lol

04:00:14
thdxr: @thdxr no it sucks

04:00:18
<transcript>: So Turbo Pack reads the path and base your LTOs config in order to rose these patches, I nested us. This means I only need to figure absolute past in one place. Okay.

04:00:22
oetziofficial: i have the frameworks page on.....

04:00:23
teej_dv: lol they in your chat watching

04:00:25

04:00:34

04:00:48

thdxr: they should have made this an SPA so they could push an update to clear your screen

04:00:53
teej_dv: A R C H I V E time

04:00:53
thdxr: SSR loses again

04:00:57
<transcript>: Can I let's see if I can get this. I got the URL to it at least copy link address. Here we go. Let's see if the way back machine has anything for this.

04:01:05
<transcript>: I'm so delicate. Right now. I'm so careful.

04:01:09

04:01:13
<transcript>: slash

04:01:14
<transcript>: Slash.

04:01:18
<transcript>: Slash? Nope.

04:01:18
<transcript>: why can't

04:01:20
<transcript>: Why can't I.

04:01:26
<transcript>: Okay. Well.

04:01:28
teej_dv: oh, he's focused

04:01:30
<transcript>: Feels bad.

04:01:30
<transcript>: we're stuck

04:01:32
<transcript>: We're stuck on this page.

04:01:39
<transcript>: Oh, he's focus.

04:01:45
<transcript>: I see you. Lee Rob is lerob here.

04:01:50
nexxeln: LUL

04:01:53
<transcript>: Should have made this a spa so they could push an update to clear screen. Yeah, exactly. Archive time.

04:01:56
<transcript>: Ssr loses again.

04:01:56
<transcript>: this

04:01:58
<transcript>: This is also funny.

04:02:01
<transcript>: Hey, Lee Rob, if you're here.

04:02:04
griimick: feel special that you have it in your cache

04:02:07
<transcript>: Answer my DM I want to know when I get all the VODs I need all the video come and do a recap.

04:02:07
<transcript>: un

04:02:12
<transcript>: Unlike this Precap, the recap will happen after the conference.

04:02:23
<transcript>: Feel special that you have it in your cache. I do feel special.

04:02:23
<transcript>: unfortunately

04:02:25
<transcript>: Unfortunately, I think I just have this page.

04:02:27
<transcript>: I don't have any other pages.

04:02:34
<transcript>: So it's interesting.

04:02:39
<transcript>: This is a turbo build site. They've got repo and pack is like this top level.

04:02:43
<transcript>: See that.

04:02:43
nexxeln: you can stilll navigate

04:02:48
nexxeln: just don't refresh

04:02:50
<transcript>: Turbo repo. You got turbo pack.

04:02:54
<transcript>: I guess I'm maybe I'm too simple I'm some understanding why it's not one thing.

04:02:54
<transcript>: why is t

04:02:57
<transcript>: Why is turbo repo and turbo pack? Not one thing.

04:03:01
oetziofficial: ohhh they reverted to a old state of the page

04:03:03
<transcript>: Can we just not differentiate between model repos and single repos anymore? And just say.

04:03:10
<transcript>: Any given repo is probably a montrepo. You can add as many stuff things to it as you want in a package's directory or something.

04:03:14
<transcript>: Just don't refresh I can still navigate.

04:03:20
<transcript>: They reverted to an old state of the page.

04:03:23
<transcript>: So I don't think I can navigate because.

04:03:27
<transcript>: Oh, I wonder if I have them.

04:03:27
<transcript>: i'm

04:03:31
nexxeln: turborepo is monorepo build tooling, tubropack is a webpack alternative

04:03:34
<transcript>: I'm so scared to click the wrong button. I wonder if I have them like, you know how it prefetches all the pages.

04:03:43
thdxr: I guess turborepo is a command runner that can run any command in the most efficient order  one of those commands can be turbopack

04:03:44
nexxeln: you can navigate throught client-side js

04:03:45
<transcript>: Okay. Next is explain it to me. Turbo repo is Mono repo build tooling. Turbo pack is what pack? I'll try. I get that. But I guess what I'm saying is like.

04:03:53
<transcript>: I see, yeah, I see. Dax. So.

04:04:07
texoport: Isn't turborepo the one doing the caching as opposed to turbobuild?

04:04:08
oetziofficial: yes it works client side

04:04:08
<transcript>: There would be downsides. So just having it all as one big CLI like turbo repo and turbo pack.

04:04:14
<transcript>: I get what they are. I know that they're different. I'm just saying, like.

04:04:18
texoport: can't you have the same caching if you used vite with turborepo?

04:04:23
<transcript>: Would it have been so bad to not buy for Kate and to just say every everybody using Turbo Pack also has this ability to.

04:04:23
<transcript>: do the

04:04:25
<transcript>: Do the Monore.

04:04:25
<transcript>: build stuff

04:04:26
<transcript>: Build stuff.

04:04:26
<transcript>: with that

04:04:28
oetziofficial: i clicked from frameworks to css and it worked

04:04:29
<transcript>: With that have been so bad is what I'm saying.

04:04:36
<transcript>: You clicked from Framework to CSS, and it worked.

04:04:36
<transcript>: so

04:04:42
<transcript>: So I'm so scared, but okay, I guess there's nothing else we want to read on this page. Oh, we can do it. We do have all the pages. Fetched.

04:04:45
thdxr: they probably wanted to use Rust instead of Go (which is what turborepo was made in)

04:04:51
<transcript>: Do I just kill my network now I can't stream if I come on network. Could I kill network in this tab so that we don't accidentally refresh? I'm doing it.

04:04:54
<transcript>: Am I playing with fire? Here.

04:05:04
<transcript>: Offline. Should I do it? Is that terrible? That's a terrible idea.

04:05:04
<transcript>: we'll see what happens

04:05:06
<transcript>: We'll see what happens.

04:05:06
teej_dv: by the time he gets this sorted out, they will have announced at conf

04:05:07
<transcript>: Like in another.

04:05:10
<transcript>: I'm just thinking, like.

04:05:10
<transcript>: can i prevent

04:05:13
<transcript>: Can I prevent it from refreshing.

04:05:17
<transcript>: So true teach.

04:05:17
<transcript>: they probably

04:05:27
<transcript>: They probably wanted to use Rust instead of Go, which is what Turborico's made in. Oh, that's right. I've actually contributed to Turbo Repo. I've actually written some Go in the Turbo Reaper repo.

04:05:30
<transcript>: That's the Mini flex.

04:05:30
<transcript>: just letting you know

04:05:35
<transcript>: Just letting you know that I know it's in Go, you know I'm saying I know that.

04:05:35
<transcript>: because i did

04:05:36
texoport: turborepo repo

04:05:36
thdxr: lol

04:05:39
nexxeln: damn

04:05:40
griimick: lol

04:05:46
<transcript>: Because I did some things. Actually, DAX, I did some things to make it work with CDK out directories. Before I did some things in the Turbo Reaper repo. You couldn't just go cash a CDK out.

04:05:52
<transcript>: Now you can. You're welcome. You're welcome, DAX. That's for you. That's for you in the SSD. Folk.

04:05:55
<transcript>: Wasn't gonna do I was gonna see when I say.

04:05:55
<transcript>: offline

04:06:00
<transcript>: Offline. Does it just like, kick the page off now. Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

04:06:00
<transcript>: i'm just gonna make

04:06:05
<transcript>: I'm just gonna make sure you know that we don't accidentally refresh the page.

04:06:10
<transcript>: I was ready for big sad moment right there.

04:06:10
<transcript>: i

04:06:13
<transcript>: I think for the Volume Grimick.

04:06:20
<transcript>: Okay. So we can read all these docs. Now people.

04:06:20
<transcript>: they can't

04:06:23
<transcript>: They can't stop me. But first.

04:06:24
nexxeln: can someone explain to me what sst exactly does?

04:06:25
<transcript>: But first.

04:06:25
<transcript>: i want

04:06:27
<transcript>: I want to get.

04:06:31
<transcript>: Hey, DAX, can you explain what SSD does.

04:06:35
<transcript>: I want to get this working again. It was working.

04:06:35
<transcript>: it

04:06:35
thdxr: idk

04:06:37
<transcript>: It was working.

04:06:41
<transcript>: Can we change our PyTorch version somehow here.

04:06:41
<transcript>: accelerate

04:06:43
<transcript>: Accelerate Version two.

04:06:43
<transcript>: so

04:06:46
<transcript>: So this is where we're installing all the things.

04:06:54
<transcript>: This AI stuff moves so fast. I bet somebody like, pushed a change to one of these things. It's one of these dependencies.

04:06:55
texoport: I really had SST confused with the whole serverless.com thing

04:06:57
<transcript>: And that broke it just like that.

04:07:00
<transcript>: It worked for a moment.

04:07:02
thdxr: Yeah we all have bad naming

04:07:02
<transcript>: And now it's gone.

04:07:06
thdxr: SST is a framework for building serverless applications on AWS

04:07:06
<transcript>: Oh, Jeez, I keep leaking that.

04:07:17
<transcript>: I don't understand the problem here.

04:07:22
thdxr: works well to get started, but we also have good patterns for "Real Companies" at scale

04:07:23
<transcript>: We train the model. Everything was fine.

04:07:25
<transcript>: It was fine.

04:07:27
<transcript>: What happened.

04:07:31
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow brand codes.

04:07:43
<transcript>: Serverless. Comm. There's serverless framework. There's serverless or there's SST. Different things.

04:07:52
<transcript>: Join the SST Disc Disc Disc discord.

04:07:53
laytanl_: @thdxr can you link it?

04:07:55
thdxr: http://sst.dev/

04:07:56
<transcript>: I would guess.

04:07:56
<transcript>: the ssd

04:08:05
<transcript>: The SSD Disc Discord is the best place to be if you want to build serverless and you're new to it, that's probably the best place to be in it. Dax not even like Self flexing.

04:08:08
thdxr: I think so!

04:08:08
nexxeln: so its a wrapper around aws serverless stuff?

04:08:12
<transcript>: I feel like that's probably objectively the best community you could join if you want to build serverless stuff and you've never done it.

04:08:20
<transcript>: Okay. What's prompting. Oh, wait, wait, wait.

04:08:20
<transcript>: i didn't

04:08:27
<transcript>: I didn't remove the eight bit atom. Oh, oh, this is a change from what we did earlier.

04:08:27
<transcript>: ha ha

04:08:28
<transcript>: Ha ha.

04:08:28
<transcript>: that could

04:08:30
<transcript>: That could that could help.

04:08:31
thdxr: yeah we try to smooth out rough edges in aws and make it feel as simple as more modern tools

04:08:36
thdxr: to various degrees of success :)

04:08:39
<transcript>: Gradient checkpoint. Flag for around. Okay. We don't want to add that, but I do want to remove that. Okay. 5800. Let's see. You think I did it.

04:08:42
oetziofficial: dang it... i pressed on "migrate from webpack" and it broke.

04:08:43
<transcript>: Photo of Skis Person or UK.

04:08:43
<transcript>: uk

04:08:45
<transcript>: Ukj.

04:08:46
nexxeln: oh thats great for someone like me

04:08:48
<transcript>: Imagine.

04:08:48
<transcript>: imagine having

04:08:50
<transcript>: Imagine having like the whole nail.

04:08:50
<transcript>: locally

04:08:52
<transcript>: Locally in your browser. Cache.

04:08:52
<transcript>: when it's no longer

04:08:54
<transcript>: When it's no longer available.

04:08:57
nexxeln: but i would still have to use my own aws acc right?

04:09:01
<transcript>: And not looking at it. We're not even looking at it right now. We're doing other things. We're gonna get the back to it.

04:09:03
<transcript>: It's so old news that we'll get back to it.

04:09:03
<transcript>: we're just

04:09:07
<transcript>: We're just. We're making sure the Versaille folks are off our scent, you know.

04:09:07
texoport: The section for long running jobs feels a lot nicer than serverless.com's offerings IMO

04:09:20
<transcript>: Reduce the save interval to lower than Max trainsteps to save weights from intermediate steps, save sample prompt can be same as instrument generating intermediate samples saved along with weights and samples. Directory.

04:09:22
<transcript>: Okay.

04:09:23
laytanl_: @thdxr only for js/ts?

04:09:23
thdxr: does serverless.com have long running jobs?

04:09:27
<transcript>: Let's try training. Now.

04:09:32
<transcript>: And then we'll start changing other stuff. I don't know. We'll start.

04:09:35
<transcript>: Looking at some of these other.

04:09:38
<transcript>: Pretrained VAE.

04:09:38
<transcript>: i don't know

04:09:39
<transcript>: I don't know.

04:09:39
<transcript>: we'll see okay

04:09:39
thdxr: @laytanl_ we support JS/TS the best, Go the next best and then we also have support for python, .net, java

04:09:45
<transcript>: We'll see. Okay, let's go back to the docs leaks. We're leaking if you don't want next. Shit.

04:09:45
<transcript>: spoiled

04:09:46
<transcript>: Spoiled.

04:09:48
<transcript>: Leave.

04:09:48
<transcript>: it pain

04:09:55
<transcript>: It pains me to say, leave because I like when people are here, but leave because we're gonna spoil it. We're spoiling it right now.

04:09:55
<transcript>: okay

04:09:56
<transcript>: Okay, turbo pack.

04:09:56
<transcript>: i

04:09:59
<transcript>: I wanted to look at Turbo Pack versus v.

04:10:11
<transcript>: So V does a development environment that uses native ESMs deliver Snappy Dead Server Before we built Turbo Pack, we considered VIT is one of several options to speed up Nexus Dev server. They considered it folks.

04:10:14
texoport: @thdxr They let you create SQS creators/consumers

04:10:20
<transcript>: However, we decided that Beats Native ASM Architecture brought too many speed bottlenecks to learn more about decision, check out the docs on why we created our bag. We already read that.

04:10:20
<transcript>: turbo

04:10:21
texoport: I guess it's not exactly the same ofc

04:10:25
<transcript>: Turbo pack can outperform. Okay, I'm over this. Over this music.

04:10:33
oetziofficial: @adamdotdev do NOT click on "Migrate from Webpack"

04:10:35
<transcript>: Section for long running jobs. Feels a lot nicer than service. I'm at SSD. Yeah.

04:10:36
<transcript>: And.

04:10:50
nexxeln: imagine if they had dropped this on viteconf day LUL

04:10:57
<transcript>: Actually soft. Use your own a biscuit. You know what? We're gonna build something on this very stream. Not today, but on my stream. We're gonna build a little thing for making it easier to stand up a good Atabis account that you can feel good about working in. It's gonna be like an initialization of your AWS account for people who are new people.

04:10:57
<transcript>: who

04:10:59
<transcript>: Who just want like good same default.

04:10:59
<transcript>: it's gonna

04:11:04
thdxr: @adamdotdev do you have a name for that project

04:11:06
thdxr: aws.dev lol

04:11:12
<transcript>: It's gonna be like a little web app you go into. You kind of Bolt it to your aid of this account and then you click a button and it runs some stuff and you can click another button and get rid of my things so that doesn't touch your account again. That'll be something we build here.

04:11:12
<transcript>: things can be called

04:11:18
nexxeln: i can't even make an aws acc because i don't have a credit card

04:11:19
<transcript>: Things can be called yoked like you yoke your A. Tobias account to this thing and then it takes care of you.

04:11:19
<transcript>: it pulls you

04:11:21
<transcript>: It pulls you along. You know I'm saying.

04:11:26
thdxr: doesn't yoked mean really jacked

04:11:26
<transcript>: Already own like all the Yoked domains so don't even check.

04:11:30
<transcript>: Section for long range. Okay.

04:11:39
<transcript>: Let's create SQS creators consumers not exactly the same. I do not click on migrate from webpack really? Etsy. What'll happen.

04:11:40
thdxr: muscles

04:11:45
<transcript>: What'll happen? Imagine if they drop this on Veetcaf day.

04:11:50
<transcript>: Do you have a name for that project? Aws, Dev, that would be great.

04:11:50
<transcript>: that domain

04:11:51
<transcript>: That domain is not available.

04:11:55
<transcript>: Can't even make an AIS account because I don't have a credit card.

04:11:59
oetziofficial: it changes the page fully.

04:12:04
griimick: @thdxr yeah

04:12:06
<transcript>: You I think the that's another yeah, another term. But it's also like how you yoke like two oxen. They're yoked together. You know, I'm saying.

04:12:06
<transcript>: that's what it

04:12:08
<transcript>: That's what it means.

04:12:08
<transcript>: it

04:12:14
<transcript>: It changes the page fully. Okay. Good call. O Etsy. I will not click on Turbo Pack versus webpack.

04:12:15
thdxr: ah yeah I do yoke my oxen

04:12:23
<transcript>: Anybody else see any landmines that I shouldn't click on? Let me know we're trying to navigate these docs that are very much not available right now.

04:12:25
<transcript>: They're not public.

04:12:25
<transcript>: these

04:12:27
<transcript>: These docs aren't public.

04:12:27
<transcript>: but we've got

04:12:29
<transcript>: But we've got them right here.

04:12:29
<transcript>: a little sneaky

04:12:34
<transcript>: A little sneaky peak for you if you want to wait and you don't want to be spoiled.

04:12:34
<transcript>: just got like

04:12:39
<transcript>: Just got like 2 hours left just hang out just get off here.

04:12:39
<transcript>: yeah

04:12:41
<transcript>: Yeah, I do yoke my oxen.

04:12:50
<transcript>: What is AWS, Dev? Is there actually anything? There nothing. They're not even using it.

04:12:50
<transcript>: come

04:12:52
vim_cerf: Exclusive previews PopCorn sthCozy

04:12:52
<transcript>: Come on, AWS.

04:12:54
<transcript>: Come on.

04:12:58
<transcript>: Telling me you own AWS, Dev, and you're not even using it.

04:13:03
<transcript>: You might be taken seriously by developers AWS.

04:13:03
<transcript>: let's

04:13:05
<transcript>: Let's put something up.

04:13:05
<transcript>: we'll just give

04:13:07
<transcript>: We'll just give it to me.

04:13:15
<transcript>: Okay, so TurboX Dev server starts up much faster.

04:13:16
tayloreddev: google probably own it LUL

04:13:22
nexxeln: aws.new

04:13:23
<transcript>: Then beat on a 1000 module application. V takes four 8 seconds to start up.

04:13:27
<transcript>: Turbo pack starts up in 9 seconds.

04:13:29
<transcript>: Okay.

04:13:32
<transcript>: What's a module? I don't have a good. I don't have a good.

04:13:38
thdxr: a module is a file

04:13:39
thdxr: in js

04:13:39
<transcript>: Mental model for what they mean by module like everything you export from a file is a module.

04:13:41
thdxr: including deps

04:13:47
<transcript>: A module is a file in JavaScript. Okay, thanks. Aws. New would be so good.

04:13:49
<transcript>: Aws, new.

04:13:50
texoport: I did a whois on aws.dev and "Registrant Name: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY"

04:13:56
<transcript>: That would be the perfect domain. Is that new? Even a new TLD.

04:13:58
nexxeln: omg LUL

04:13:59
<transcript>: The Dodo, his TLD.

04:13:59
<transcript>: tears

04:14:00
<transcript>: Tears.

04:14:00
<transcript>: what one

04:14:01
<transcript>: What one.

04:14:03
<transcript>: Anybody know.

04:14:06
nexxeln: of course

04:14:10
<transcript>: Did it. Who is on aid of a seven register name redacted for Privacy. Yeah, that's most dead. That's most domains, right.

04:14:16
<transcript>: Exclusive previews here on Adam stream.

04:14:20
<transcript>: I'm not really a leaker. I'm not really a person who has exclusive, anything.

04:14:20
<transcript>: so google

04:14:24
nexxeln: there's vite.new vue.new react.new t3.new

04:14:26
<transcript>: So Google owns that new as well. Geez, Google just cornering all the new TLDs.

04:14:26
<transcript>: how do

04:14:29
nexxeln: so many news

04:14:29
<transcript>: How do I? How do I get.

04:14:29
<transcript>: let's get

04:14:31
<transcript>: Let's get that new.

04:14:38
thdxr: We're going to see the FBI breaking into adam's house for leaking

04:14:41
texoport: I need old.new

04:14:43
<transcript>: I would have totally taken it. If it was available, I would have spent whatever. Aws, new. Adam. Not new. Oh, Geez.

04:14:45
oetziofficial: we stumbled on the docs yeye 👀

04:14:47
<transcript>: There's a TLD I don't have Adam for.

04:14:50
<transcript>: I want it.

04:14:50
<transcript>: where is it

04:14:52
<transcript>: Where is it.

04:14:52
<transcript>: did it do it

04:14:53
<transcript>: Did it do it.

04:14:55
<transcript>: Domain Name search.

04:14:55
<transcript>: adam

04:15:00
<transcript>: Adam New. I don't know why I would want that what I would do with it.

04:15:02
<transcript>: $500 a year.

04:15:10
<transcript>: Google and their prices, their domain prices. Like all the good devs. I have like 800 a year. It's so dumb.

04:15:10
<transcript>: what

04:15:11
nexxeln: new adam

04:15:14
<transcript>: What's? Something. Start new? What would I? What would I want? New.

04:15:16
<transcript>: This is such a tangent.

04:15:19
cowfacedude99: that's expensive LUL

04:15:20
<transcript>: I'm new.

04:15:20
<transcript>: can't have

04:15:22
<transcript>: Can't have posh bees.

04:15:24
thdxr: betteraws.new

04:15:27
<transcript>: You're new.

04:15:30
<transcript>: I guess it'd be.

04:15:32
<transcript>: E Right, you're new.

04:15:32
<transcript>: yeah that's

04:15:34
<transcript>: Yeah. That's lame. Okay.

04:15:35
mhuggins7278: developer.new

04:15:41
<transcript>: Let's let's finish these so in a large application.

04:15:41
<transcript>: this differential

04:15:44
texoport: old.new is available lol

04:15:45
<transcript>: This differential stays consistent, and a 300 module application.

04:15:47
<transcript>: Can I do it.

04:15:49
<transcript>: Starts up.

04:15:53
<transcript>: Five and a half times faster than meat.

04:15:59
<transcript>: They got a realistic like it's actually how long it takes.

04:16:14
<transcript>: Code updates when a file changes, it needs to render the changes to the browser. The faster it can do that, the tighter your feedback loop in the Fast Real ship. In a 1000 module application, Turbo Vac can react to file changes five, eight times faster than v.

04:16:14
<transcript>: they're so apple

04:16:14
jamdotexe: I prefer .old to .new. You could have thenew.old and list NPM packages that are more an 1 hour old Kappa

04:16:28
<transcript>: They're so Apple Versaille is like just all these charts of, like how long it takes them to do stuff versus the other thing. I feel like there's a new in more chip new M series chip coming out. That's what Versaille like. Feels like at this point in 2022.

04:16:31
thdxr: I think these stats are weird

04:16:36
<transcript>: We're gonna see the FBI breaking in. I mean, they did raise, like, $300 million, so they could probably do things to me.

04:16:38
mhuggins7278: we started using nx for a monorepo setup at work been happy with it so far

04:16:43
<transcript>: That I don't want done vitenew VIEWNew React New Those are all available.

04:16:45
<transcript>: How old is the new TLD.

04:16:48
<transcript>: I can't believe.

04:16:48
<transcript>: react

04:16:50
nexxeln: make it 30000 components in the hmr chart

04:16:50
<transcript>: React new is available.

04:16:51
<transcript>: are you

04:16:52
<transcript>: Are you serious.

04:16:55
thdxr: Vite's approach is when a file changes, it ONLY needs to be rebuild/reload what changes since they use that browser ESM approach

04:16:57
<transcript>: Oh, that's taken.

04:17:04
nexxeln: its not available @adamdotdev

04:17:05
<transcript>: Old new.

04:17:06
thdxr: so I don't know why a 10,000 module app matters on rebuilds

04:17:09
<transcript>: We stumbled on the docks.

04:17:12
<transcript>: Better AWS, new.

04:17:12
<transcript>: that's not bad

04:17:13
nexxeln: i was saying its a real thing

04:17:13
<transcript>: That's not bad.

04:17:18
<transcript>: A little long. Better. Aws, Fry teeth.

04:17:18
<transcript>: develop

04:17:21
<transcript>: Developer knew is that available.

04:17:24
<transcript>: No.

04:17:27
<transcript>: Old news available.

04:17:33
<transcript>: You could have the new old list MPM packages are more than 1 hour old.

04:17:34
laytanl_: awsecure

04:17:52
<transcript>: Started using Index for a Montereypa setup and been happy with it so far. So the thing about NX, and this is why I got confused with Nick's earlier. The thing about NX is it's like a whole lot of things. And I think that works against it. For me, it's like the whole, like, generation. Oh, look, we're training people.

04:17:56
<transcript>: The whole like code generator side of it.

04:17:56
<transcript>: and all

04:18:05
<transcript>: And all the, like, templates and all that stuff. Like, I like Turbo Repo, because it's just one thing. It builds your projects super fast, caches.

04:18:05
<transcript>: we're

04:18:07
<transcript>: We're done here. You know, I'm playing.

04:18:13
<transcript>: Nick, their INX is like you got a lot of stuff to learn. It's why I don't like Kitty.

04:18:13
<transcript>: as an emulator

04:18:18
<transcript>: As an emulator. I like Alacrity because it does one thing. You can even make tabs. I like it.

04:18:25
texoport: Doesn't like Kitty. #cancelled

04:18:31
<transcript>: Make it 30,000 Coma components in the HMR chart. Yeah, we did that, did we? I'm just way behind these approaches. When a file changes, it only needs to be rebuild. Reload what changes? Since they use that browser ESM approach.

04:18:34
<transcript>: But, DAX, we just learned that slow.

04:18:41
<transcript>: Thanks so much for the follow behind the horizon it's not available. I don't know why 100 module matters on rebuilds.

04:18:41
<transcript>: saying it's real

04:18:43
<transcript>: Saying it's real thing. Aw.

04:18:43
<transcript>: secure

04:18:44
<transcript>: Secure.

04:18:57
<transcript>: Doesn't like Kitty canceled. I mean, I'm sure Kitty's great. Actually, I just when presented with two options, one of them has fewer features and still has the things I know about and care about. I'll choose the one that has less.

04:18:59
mhuggins7278: totally we don't use alot of the code generation yet

04:19:02
<transcript>: I can't believe we're not just reading these docs.

04:19:05
texoport: I use ST, so I'm one to talk

04:19:08
<transcript>: So let's see what else we want to learn about roadmap. Core concepts. Let's see core concepts.

04:19:08
<transcript>: let's

04:19:12
<transcript>: Let's dive deep into the aren't internals of turbo pack to figure out why it's so fast.

04:19:17
<transcript>: The turbo engine.

04:19:24
<transcript>: Turbo Pack is so fast, so fast because it's built on a really usable library for Rust, which enables incremental computation known as the turbo engine.

04:19:24
<transcript>: here's how it works

04:19:26
<transcript>: Here's how it works. Function level. Caching.

04:19:31
<transcript>: And a turbo repo or turbo engine powered program.

04:19:31
<transcript>: all right

04:19:32
<transcript>: All Right, Rufus.

04:19:35
<transcript>: You're you're gonna go on my list.

04:19:39
<transcript>: I'm just not feeling most everything I'm listening to today.

04:19:44
<transcript>: You can Mark certain functions as to be remember, you'll know what? You know what? You know what.

04:19:44
<transcript>: we'll fix it

04:19:47
<transcript>: We'll fix it. There is something I'm always feeling.

04:19:51
<transcript>: And that is all J.

04:19:55
<transcript>: And if TG is still here.

04:19:58
<transcript>: Still appreciates mallj.

04:19:59
<transcript>: mallju

04:19:59
<transcript>: mallju totally

04:20:02
<transcript>: Mallju Totally. We don't use a lot of the code generation yet.

04:20:06
nexxeln: have you ever tried listening to hyperpop

04:20:07
<transcript>: I use St. So I'm one to talk. What's St.

04:20:11
<transcript>: stick

04:20:14
texoport: suckless terminal lol

04:20:17
<transcript>: Stick ever tried listening to hyperprop? Hyperpop? I don't know what that is. Is that a type of music.

04:20:17
<transcript>: suck

04:20:19
<transcript>: Suckless terminal.

04:20:19
<transcript>: that really

04:20:23
<transcript>: That really. Is that really a terminal? Emulator. That's awesome.

04:20:28
nexxeln: genre of music

04:20:35
<transcript>: Okay, so you can Mark certain functions as to be remembered when these functions are called. The turbo engine will remember what they were called with and what they returned. So it like memoises.

04:20:35
<transcript>: your function

04:20:39
<transcript>: Your functions it'll then save it in an inmemory cache.

04:20:41
<transcript>: I don't have the image.

04:20:41
<transcript>: simplified example

04:20:43
<transcript>: Simplified example of what this might look like.

04:20:43
<transcript>: in a bundle

04:20:45
<transcript>: In a bundler.

04:20:45
<transcript>: so

04:20:50
<transcript>: So what's? What's going on here? Why don't I have this image? They took it down, they took it down.

04:21:01
texoport: suckless is like a collection of "minimal" software or whatever. I just use it because it feels snappier than Kitty for me

04:21:09
<transcript>: Well, we start with calling Read File on two files API TS and SDK TS within Bundle. Those files can cap them together and end up with the full bundle at the end.

04:21:12
<transcript>: Okay.

04:21:21
nexxeln: alacritty 🤓

04:21:27
<transcript>: The results of all those function calls get saved in the cache for later. Let's imagine that we're running on a debt server. You save the SDK TS file on your machine. Turbo Pack receives the file system event and knows it needs to recompute. Readfile SDK TS. Okay.

04:21:27
<transcript>: since the result of

04:21:36
<transcript>: Since the result of this. Yet SDK TSS has changed. We need to bundle it again, which then needs to be concatenated again. Crucially API TS hasn't changed.

04:21:36
<transcript>: we

04:21:50
<transcript>: We read its result from the cache and pass that to Concate instead. Okay, so they're not reading every file. Every time you change one file. That makes sense. Imagine this in a real bundler with thousands of files to read and transformation. Execute mental models, the same.

04:21:50
<transcript>: enormous

04:21:55
<transcript>: Enormousness of work by remembering the result of function calls and not redoing work that's been done before. Okay.

04:21:55
<transcript>: turbo

04:22:13
<transcript>: Turbo Engine currently stores its cash in memory. This needs a cash flow lasts as long as the process running it, which works well for the Dev server. When you're on Next Dev Turbo in Next 13, you'll start a cache with Turbo Engine. When you cancel your debt server the cash gets cleared in the future. We're planning to persist this cash and share it with your team.

04:22:13
<transcript>: for

04:22:15
marquescoding: how is your turbo.build different from my turbo.build LUL

04:22:19
<transcript>: For free on Versaille. I just got I just did next. Js. Conf. 2023. I just did it.

04:22:19
<transcript>: i just

04:22:21
<transcript>: I just did the keynote for you.

04:22:24
<transcript>: Not really, but that's what Turbo Repo does.

04:22:24
<transcript>: what they call it

04:22:28
<transcript>: What they call it shared, shared, something.

04:22:31
<transcript>: A genre of music.

04:22:31
<transcript>: is called

04:22:32
<transcript>: Is called.

04:22:33
nexxeln: its unreleased stuff @MarquesCoding

04:22:36
<transcript>: What'd you call it hyperpop. I have not.

04:22:36
<transcript>: but

04:22:38
<transcript>: But it sounds interesting.

04:22:48
jamdotexe: How was next.js conf?

04:22:49
<transcript>: Suckless is like a collection of minimal software or whatever, because you'll snappier than kittier for me. Alacrity, that's what I'm using. Next. How's your Turbo DUT? Different from my Turbo build.

04:22:53
<transcript>: How is it? Because.

04:22:53
<transcript>: magic

04:22:57
<transcript>: Magic. What's yours look like? Oh, yours. Looks like this. Probably.

04:22:59
<transcript>: Mine. Looks like this.

04:23:04
<transcript>: They're not public. These docs aren't public.

04:23:12
nexxeln: what a flex @adamdotdev

04:23:21
oetziofficial: @jamdotexe has not started yet

04:23:22
<transcript>: Sorry I'm that's like such a reference that no one gets. I'm like subtweeting a tweet from a few days ago where a certain figure on the Internet on Twitter was letting everyone know they were reading the next 13 docs, and they're so good, but they're not public. You can't read them, but they're so good.

04:23:22
<transcript>: and

04:23:26
<transcript>: And I've just been playing that I've been beaten that drum ever since.

04:23:32
<transcript>: It's unreleased stuff. How was next shift? Cough We'll find out if.

04:23:32
<transcript>: it hasn't started yet

04:23:35
<transcript>: It hasn't started yet. We're just kind of leaking.

04:23:35
<transcript>: we're spoili

04:23:35
jamdotexe: Ah ok, no worries

04:23:38
<transcript>: We're spoiling a bit. We're just talking about what's coming.

04:23:38
<transcript>: what a flag

04:23:40
<transcript>: What a flags.

04:23:45
texoport: I'll start using Remix as I watch Next conf

04:23:47
<transcript>: No, we're gonna watch it here together, on this very stream.

04:23:47
<transcript>: if you'd

04:23:50
<transcript>: If you'd like to watch NXT. Comp with me.

04:23:52
<transcript>: Either stick around or come back in a couple hours.

04:23:52
<transcript>: cause we're gonna

04:23:57
<transcript>: Cause we're gonna watch? We're gonna watch the keynote where they talk about Turbo pack.

04:24:03
<transcript>: Okay.

04:24:03
<transcript>: persist

04:24:05
<transcript>: Persist.

04:24:12
<transcript>: Yeah. Yeah. Remote cache. Like Turbo replace. Yep. This will mean that Turbo Pack could remember work done across runs and machines. So now imagine.

04:24:16
<transcript>: You're working on stuff.

04:24:16
<transcript>: you run

04:24:21
<transcript>: You run a function. It memoises that function. The cache is persisted to disk.

04:24:21
<transcript>: and share

04:24:23
<transcript>: And shared with your team.

04:24:25
jamdotexe: I will probably watch it back while working tomorrow, if possible. Would rather get paid to watch! :D

04:24:30
<transcript>: Well, how would that work? You're working on a feature. They don't have your code. They don't need that. I don't know.

04:24:30
<transcript>: i'm just saying

04:24:32
<transcript>: I'm just saying.

04:24:32
<transcript>: there's

04:24:52
<transcript>: There's potential. That's what Turbo Repo gets you. If you've built a project, your teammate shouldn't have to build it. They just get your build assets, right? Daxis is what you're saying earlier. I don't have to access still here. But you were saying how you saw the cash probably was persisted to this. We just confirmed it's not. It's actually all in memory. But in the future.

04:24:52
<transcript>: they're gonna persist

04:24:55
<transcript>: They're gonna persist it to file system or remote cache.

04:25:09
<transcript>: This approach makes Turbo back extremely fast at Computing Incremental. Updates to your Apps this optimizes Trope pack for handling updates and development, meaning your Dev server will always respond. Snappily to changes in the future, persistent cash will open the door to much faster production builds.

04:25:09
<transcript>: but remember

04:25:15
<transcript>: But remember when work done, a cross runs, new production builds could only rebuild, change files, particularly into enormous time savings. Now that would be cool.

04:25:15
<transcript>: like honestly

04:25:18
<transcript>: Like honestly in Dev.

04:25:18
<transcript>: i'm getting all

04:25:19
oetziofficial: gotta head home, cya all later!

04:25:22
<transcript>: I'm getting all excited about Turbo Back, but like my Mac studio.

04:25:22
<transcript>: build my

04:25:23
texoport: I dunno, Vite has always been very fast and snappy, even in a large React app

04:25:28
<transcript>: Build my next projects in like 10 seconds, not 10 seconds. Build some super fast. But then again, I'm mostly working on small projects.

04:25:36
texoport: for development, I mena

04:25:37
texoport: mean*

04:25:38
<transcript>: So I guess if you're like working at McDonald's and you have an XJS project, it's probably huge and you care about this stuff a lot more.

04:25:44
<transcript>: But the production part cos.

04:25:47
<transcript>: The production part is.

04:25:47
<transcript>: compelling

04:25:52
<transcript>: Compelling if your production builds could only incrementally have to build that's pretty cool.

04:25:55
jamdotexe: Yea, vite is great - always something faster coming along

04:26:02
<transcript>: Compiling by request. The Turbo engine helps provide extremely fast updates on your Dev server. There's another important.

04:26:08
<transcript>: Metric to consider startup time, the faster your Dev server can start running, the faster you can get to your work.

04:26:08
<transcript>: there are two

04:26:17
<transcript>: There are two asymmetric processor. Yeah, we already read that page level compilation versions of Next JS from two to three years ago. Used to compile the entire application for showing your data.

04:26:34
<transcript>: Eleven we begin only the code the page requested. It's better, but it's not perfect. We navigate the users. We'll bundle all the client and server modules, dynamic, imported modules, and reference CSS and images. That means if a large part of your page is hidden from view or hidden behind tabs will still compile it anyway.

04:26:41
<transcript>: Okay, Turbo Pack is smart enough to compile only the code you request. I mean, if a browser press HTML, we can pile it only to HML.

04:26:51
<transcript>: For browser wants some CSS. We'll compare only that. Okay. So they're very granular with their compiling. They do as little work as possible to make it very fast.

04:26:51
<transcript>: what's the roadmap

04:26:56
<transcript>: What's the roadmap say? We've got big plans for Turbo Pack here's what we're aiming for in the future.

04:27:10
<transcript>: Right now, Turbo Pack is being used as an optin feature index. Yes, it's Dev server. This is helping to create an extremely fast variance load of scopes. Next, we're going to need sort of an hour. Oh, so it's not even production builds up front. It's just Dev servers.

04:27:14
<transcript>: Good to know.

04:27:14
<transcript>: svel

04:27:20
<transcript>: Svelt we're planning to build a first class integration with Cell to let Turbofact power the next generation of subkit applications. Cool.

04:27:28
<transcript>: Other frameworks and active discussions with other frameworks to bring Turbo Pack to their users. We're excited to see what we can build together.

04:27:28
<transcript>: remote

04:27:32
<transcript>: Remote caching through Tags built on the ground up take advantage of cashing.

04:27:36
jamdotexe: Will you have a vod available, or will next.js conf be available on YT for watching later?

04:27:39
<transcript>: So they're gonna do the turbo repo repo thing. The remote caching thing. You'll get it for free on Versaille. I'm sure that'll be cool.

04:27:39
<transcript>: and then

04:27:42
<transcript>: And then migration for Webpack users.

04:27:44
texoport: IMO remote caching is a lot more useful but you can do that with Turborepo anyway

04:27:52
<transcript>: Fusion with Turbo. Now we're talking. We are currently migrating rewriting Turbo repo in Rust. Look at this Tiege. Is Tich still here.

04:27:52
<transcript>: teach

04:27:59
<transcript>: Teach you have so many jobs to do it Versaille. If you if you chose there's so much rest being flung.

04:27:59
<transcript>: ever

04:28:05
<transcript>: Ever sell and I'm now convinced that they flew.

04:28:05
<transcript>: prime out there

04:28:09
<transcript>: Prime out there as a guest of honor because they want to woo him.

04:28:09
<transcript>: they're doing

04:28:17
<transcript>: They're doing like a College athlete. Like when the College athlete is like trying to figure out what school they want to go to, like, a coveted recruit for, like, a football team or something.

04:28:17
<transcript>: all the team

04:28:21
texoport: Ferric oxide, yas

04:28:22
<transcript>: All the teams come out and they have them come to their Stadium and like they wow them.

04:28:24
<transcript>: All the fancy.

04:28:24
<transcript>: fac

04:28:26
<transcript>: Facilities.

04:28:26
<transcript>: all the perks

04:28:35
<transcript>: All the perks of being there on campus. That's what they're doing with prime right now. Gueramo is personally greeting prime at the airport.

04:28:35
<transcript>: and

04:28:39
<transcript>: And he's taking him to dinner, so I'm gonna.

04:28:46
<transcript>: Stuff to do ever sell right and rust and prime is considering it I don't know, baby.

04:28:46
<transcript>: how crazy

04:28:48
<transcript>: How crazy would that be.

04:28:48
<transcript>: if

04:28:50
<transcript>: If they hired Prime.

04:28:50
<transcript>: dead

04:28:52
<transcript>: Dead.

04:28:53
<transcript>: Twitter.

04:28:53
<transcript>: would implode

04:28:55
<transcript>: Would implode.

04:29:02
<transcript>: Talk about personality. I just talked at the beginning of stream. How.

04:29:05
<transcript>: I think the problem with verselle, they're so polished.

04:29:05
<transcript>: and everything

04:29:09
<transcript>: And everything's so like applelike and quality.

04:29:09
<transcript>: but that

04:29:15
<transcript>: But that is kind of like to their detriment in the Devrell sense. I feel like they're not very.

04:29:24
<transcript>: Human like, there's not a lot of personality that shines through right for sale? Devrel feels a little robotic, robotic.

04:29:24
<transcript>: it's a little

04:29:36
<transcript>: It's a little too glossy. Needs to be scuffed up a little bit. How about bringing prime in? Talk about adding some personality to verselle if they could bring prime into right rust and Do Devrel.

04:29:36
<transcript>: they pay

04:29:45
<transcript>: They pay, they pay him so much money Versell That's gonna happen it's gonna happen Just wait, Prime's gonna announce is Career change.

04:29:45
<transcript>: at next

04:29:51
<transcript>: At next conference. I'm getting crazy. But wouldn't that be cool? It'd be cool.

04:29:54
<transcript>: Broken find that in the dock.

04:29:54
<transcript>: if i can't find

04:29:56
<transcript>: If I can't find any plans.

04:29:56
<transcript>: for prime to

04:29:58
<transcript>: For prime to join herself.

04:30:05
<transcript>: I feel like tea. Zoe. I feel like Teas would know he's left. Tee. Just no longer here.

04:30:05
<transcript>: so we

04:30:14
<transcript>: So we can't confirm. But I feel like he would know he would know. Prime would have told him like they're really trying to give me to join for Sale. I'm considering it.

04:30:26
<transcript>: And the future Turbo Repo pack will merge into a single tool chain. Turbo. I called it. I told you all the confuses. These are a bundler or build system or both. Okay.

04:30:26
<transcript>: dax you still

04:30:29
<transcript>: Dax, you still hear DAX? I just need to flex a little bit on this one.

04:30:36
<transcript>: Can we talk about is next fill here. Is anyone still here? Am I alone? Am I the only one here.

04:30:36
nexxeln: wow

04:30:39
delvoid: there is a hidden announcement page about prime joining Kappa

04:30:41
<transcript>: Remote Caching is a lot more useful, but you can do that with turbo repo anyway.

04:30:43
<transcript>: Hidden Announcement Page about prime joining.

04:30:46
<transcript>: That would be awesome.

04:30:54
nexxeln: im here

04:30:54
<transcript>: Will you have a VOD available or will next year's Coffee available on YouTube for watching later, I'm gonna do jam EXP. I'm going to do.

04:30:54
<transcript>: a whole

04:30:59
<transcript>: A whole next Shaf recap as a YouTube video this week.

04:30:59
<transcript>: so friday

04:30:59
laytanl_: Am I alone LUL

04:31:02
<transcript>: So Friday, Probably. You'll see that video.

04:31:02
<transcript>: if you want

04:31:10
<transcript>: If you want to like, not watch the whole conference, all 20 speakers, and you just want like, a TLDR. I'm gonna do a whole recap.

04:31:10
<transcript>: on my youtube channel

04:31:12
<transcript>: On my YouTube channel. So check that out.

04:31:16
<transcript>: Next is here. So next can we talk about.

04:31:16
<transcript>: him i love

04:31:19
texoport: Your Youtube video was very polished, BTW. Great tone and delivery too

04:31:19
nexxeln: nextjsconf will be on vercel yt channel btw

04:31:28
<transcript>: Him. I love latent's here. Can we talk about how I totally call this that they would join them and they probably would have already, but they just didn't get to it. So I bet someone is upset of it. Gearmo hates this. Everybody hates that they have turbo repos.

04:31:30
<transcript>: He just wants one thing.

04:31:30
<transcript>: it's gonna be

04:31:32
<transcript>: It's gonna be called turbo.

04:31:35
<transcript>: I knew it just knew that.

04:31:35
<transcript>: your youtube

04:31:44
<transcript>: Your YouTube video was very polished by the way, a great tone and delivery to thanks tech support. The one thing I don't like about my YouTube video my first video is.

04:31:44
<transcript>: it's

04:31:45
jamdotexe: I will watch it tomorrow while working so I get paid to watch the whole marathon, but will watch the recap, because I will likely fade in and out LUL thanks @nexxeln

04:31:52
<transcript>: It's too polished. Lacks personality. I don't like reading for a teleprompter. It feels way too like.

04:32:02
<transcript>: I. I think I use words. I wouldn't use an actual conversation. So I love Twitch because I can just be myself and hang out with you people. It's so much fun. I love it.

04:32:02
<transcript>: youtube

04:32:14
texoport: The lighting right now is better than the video, that's the only thing that comes to mind. It felt a bit too overexposed

04:32:20
laytanl_: The dialogue did feel a little different then how it does here

04:32:20
<transcript>: Youtube feels like I need to edit it. It needs to be like, concise and all that. And so then I'm like, oh, well, I don't want to say something dumb. What? I'm trying to be so fast and concise. So then I start reading a script, and then just it loses all of its luster. So I do want to. I want to get better at that. I think my next YouTube videos should be a little more.

04:32:20
<transcript>: me

04:32:24
<transcript>: Me and a little less just reading.

04:32:27
laytanl_: But I am not sure how to put it

04:32:28
<transcript>: Lotus, Lotus Pixie thanks so much for the follow.

04:32:34
<transcript>: We'll watch it tomorrow. Next Conf will be on Versaille YouTube channel. By the way, perfect.

04:32:45
<transcript>: Do you know next win? Do you know how soon? Because I really need it to be soon. I would like to watch it all like early A. M. Tomorrow so I can start preparing my video and recording on Thursday.

04:32:45
<transcript>: i will watch

04:32:47
laytanl_: Still good though

04:32:50
nexxeln: idk that haha

04:32:54
<transcript>: I will watch it tomorrow while working, so I get paid to watch the whole marriage on. But we'll watch the recap because I will likely fade in and out. It's awesome.

04:32:54
<transcript>: the

04:33:00
laytanl_: I was bombarded with your shorts

04:33:03
<transcript>: The lighting right now is better than the video. That's the only thing that comes to mind. It felt a bit too overexposed. Interesting tech support. So many people.

04:33:03
<transcript>: that join

04:33:07
nexxeln: but the livestream vod will prolly be there? at least unlisted

04:33:17
nexxeln: just save the livestream link when it happens

04:33:18
<transcript>: That join my Twitch have opinions on lighting and I love it because I'm obsessed with this stuff and it is very hard. I've got three cameras. It's very hard to keep them all correctly exposed for both YouTube and Twitch, especially if I'm going back and forth, like.

04:33:18
<transcript>: i stream

04:33:21
texoport: Your lighting right now is _impeccable_

04:33:30
<transcript>: I stream on Tuesday and Thursday, and then if I'm recording a video for YouTube Wednesday morning, it's like in between my two streams, I'm changing all my settings. I shoot totally different settings for YouTube, so I shoot it in 4K.

04:33:30
<transcript>: and

04:33:50
<transcript>: And I shoot it in log and I do all this stuff pro resro like I'm doing all kinds of different things with my cameras. So all the exposure settings get changed and I have some presets where I've tried to save them and reload them. But yeah, it was a little overexposed. I agree that first YouTube video, the lighting was a little too much.

04:33:52
<transcript>: I.

04:33:59
<transcript>: Dialog did feel a little different than how it does here. Yeah, yeah. Not sure how to put it. Yeah, it's just too Polish. There's two, like.

04:33:59
<transcript>: two exact

04:34:00
<transcript>: Two exact.

04:34:00
<transcript>: i was nailing too many

04:34:13
<transcript>: I was nailing too many big words all in succession. You just don't talk that way. I can't say some of the sentences that I said in that video naturally, without, like trying five times like I did for the YouTube video.

04:34:18
<transcript>: I was bombarded with your shorts. Sorry about that. Yeah.

04:34:34
<transcript>: My wife said the same thing. She's like, why are you. Why do you have so many shorts? I don't know. I think I'm supposed to do shorts, so I cut up parts of the video. I'm not gonna do that anymore. I'm gonna make shorts, but hear me out. I'm gonna make shorts for YouTube, and I'm gonna make Tik Toks and watch.

04:34:42
laytanl_: No I think you should do the shorts and stuff

04:34:46
<transcript>: Things. But what I'm really excited to do is break down, like technology scenes from movie and TV. For, like, Normies. So for nontech people, I'm like, break down.

04:34:46
<transcript>: how

04:34:57
nexxeln: yoo adam ben awad arc

04:35:00
laytanl_: I think it is a thing on Youtube to break down your video into shorts for engagement

04:35:06
<transcript>: How terrible this scene is or how good it is. Like how realistic the scene is. Like, basically, there's all these we get bombarded in TV and movies with, like, people that are devs or hackers or whatever doing stuff at a computer. And I want to, like, break them down, talk about the real parts, the bad part, like, all that. I'm gonna do that on shorts.

04:35:11
<transcript>: Tech support my lighting right now is impeccable.

04:35:14
<transcript>: Impeccable. It's perfect.

04:35:21
<transcript>: The livestream. Bod will probably be there at least unlisted. Okay, good.

04:35:34
<transcript>: Just save the livestream link when it happens. Okay, cool. Your lining right now is in fact. Well, no, I think. Hey, next, if you think of it, could you save the livestream link? Because I might forget.

04:35:38
<transcript>: Could you send it to me somewhere? Twitter or something.

04:35:38
<transcript>: i think

04:35:41
<transcript>: I think you should do the shorts and stuff. Okay.

04:35:42
jamdotexe: Shorts :/

04:35:44
nexxeln: sure lol

04:35:48
<transcript>: I think it is a thing on YouTube to break down your video into shorts for engagement. Yeah, yeah, that's, yeah, that's what I was doing.

04:35:52
<transcript>: Yo Adam been Awad arc.

04:35:58
<transcript>: So I'm not really watch much of bin stuff if I'm being honest.

04:35:58
<transcript>: i don't

04:36:16
<transcript>: I don't I feel like he's like, this huge personality in Dev world, and I know nothing about him, and I don't really know any of his content or stuff. I've heard him on recent stuff, and it's like, I know I've heard that name, and I should know who it is. I just don't I don't really know his stuff. But what was his arc? Was that a good arc? Was it a bad arc.

04:36:18
texoport: I just love Ben for his dry humor

04:36:20
<transcript>: I don't know.

04:36:25
<transcript>: Okay, so these are going to fuse. I can't wait to send this to DAX.

04:36:25
<transcript>: i'm gonna

04:36:27
nexxeln: ben awad was the first coding channel i watched

04:36:28
<transcript>: I'm gonna send it to DAX right now.

04:36:32
<transcript>: Because DAX left. And I need him to know that I was right.

04:36:49
<transcript>: Okay. That was petty. But I just had to tell him, try to let him know. And, you know, I had to let him know that I knew he wasn't here anymore.

04:36:49
<transcript>: so to let

04:36:52
<transcript>: So to let him know I knew he went on about his day.

04:36:52
<transcript>: didn't even say

04:36:55
<transcript>: Didn't even say bye. Okay, we did it.

04:36:55
<transcript>: we

04:36:58
<transcript>: We trained a new model. Now we're gonna.

04:37:06
<transcript>: Ask if you're still here. I'm just kidding and anybody else. I don't care if you leave and they'll say bye another thing for all future streamers.

04:37:06
<transcript>: or current

04:37:07
<transcript>: Or current streamers.

04:37:07
<transcript>: that are listening

04:37:11
<transcript>: That are listening if I ever raid you.

04:37:14
nexxeln: what do you think about turborepo being rewritten in rust?

04:37:18
nexxeln: is that really worth it

04:37:26
<transcript>: And this is not like a big deal. But if I ever raise you, you don't need to ask me what I was working on. I don't know who wrote that in the Twitch Ethics book or whatever the Twitch Guide to, like being a member of the Twitter community. I don't know who wrote it in.

04:37:26
<transcript>: that you must

04:37:34
<transcript>: That. You must ask everyone who raid you what they were working on. Just don't ask me. I just always hate typing it up. Nobody cares.

04:37:34
<transcript>: does anyone care

04:37:35
<transcript>: Does Anyone care.

04:37:35
<transcript>: like

04:37:39
<transcript>: Like every single time I raid someone. What are you working on.

04:37:39
<transcript>: i guess

04:37:44
nexxeln: LUL

04:37:50
<transcript>: I guess. I don't know. I don't ask people. That because I just don't want to be asked. I don't like. I don't know. Maybe it's because I don't know what I'm working on half the time. It's like, what was it working? We talked about next.

04:37:51
<transcript>: And.

04:37:51
<transcript>: we played

04:37:56
<transcript>: We played a Biden clip for a while where he muttered a bunch.

04:37:56
<transcript>: what else did we do

04:37:57
jamdotexe: Yea I get that, because in a way, you are probably logging off, and they are asking you questions LUL

04:37:58
<transcript>: What else did we do.

04:37:58
<transcript>: maybe

04:38:02
<transcript>: Maybe it's because I don't stream about anything. Maybe that's the problem.

04:38:05
<transcript>: Just love Bin for his dry humor.

04:38:05
<transcript>: bin award

04:38:09
delvoid: ok, instead i will ask what colour pants you are wearing. ;)

04:38:12
<transcript>: Bin Award was the first coding channel I watch. What do you think about Turbo Reaper being rewritten and rust? I think that sounds.

04:38:12
<transcript>: interesting

04:38:21
<transcript>: Interesting. I don't know. I don't know enough about. I know Russell Rust can be faster than Go, right. I think the theoretical performance and stability.

04:38:21
<transcript>: of rust

04:38:23
<transcript>: Of rust is probably worth it.

04:38:23
<transcript>: i don't know i think

04:38:24
tiredbeaver: rustlang best lang

04:38:27
<transcript>: I don't know. I think people like prime would say, Write all your tools in rest.

04:38:27
<transcript>: facebook

04:38:33
teej_dv: rust is ALWAYS worth it Kreygasm

04:38:38
<transcript>: Facebook. I mean prime had that video that Facebook is like they're making all their tooling in rest now because of the safety. And I don't know, it's probably easier to make over time versus go.

04:38:38
<transcript>: and then there's

04:38:40
nexxeln: teej is back

04:38:43
<transcript>: And then there's probably still some performance benefit, too. So I think I guess it makes sense.

04:38:43
<transcript>: here's a question

04:38:45
tayloreddev: its.  51% rust already good efforts there

04:38:46
texoport: this is how you bring out the sleeping rustaceans

04:38:52
tiredbeaver: if you aren't a rust programmer, then you clearly aren't a programmer

04:38:53
<transcript>: Here's a question. Next. Is it really worth it? Is anything not worth it? When you've raised $350,000,000, like, what does Versaille doing with all that money.

04:38:54
<transcript>: I don't know.

04:38:54
<transcript>: i mean

04:38:58
<transcript>: I mean, they hired some pretty amazing engineers.

04:38:58
<transcript>: and their

04:39:01
nexxeln: true

04:39:04
norlock: rust >>>>> non cult lang

04:39:04
<transcript>: And their throwing some pretty cool conferences. And I'm sure they just want to have, like a pretty healthy runway.

04:39:14
<transcript>: But I think they can. Yeah. I think they can afford to hire somebody to do the best thing. They are playing longterm games, right? You have to you're raise that kind of capital.

04:39:17
<transcript>: In a way you're probably lying off.

04:39:17
<transcript>: yeah

04:39:21
teej_dv: it's easy to make the case

04:39:24
<transcript>: Yeah. I'm not always in a hurry, even. It's just like that question of what were you working on? I feel like someone has decided. You always.

04:39:24
<transcript>: ask the person

04:39:33
<transcript>: Ask the person who raids you what they're working on, or maybe that's just everyone's polite. And I'm not. And I don't think to ask that I don't know. But you don't have to ask me.

04:39:33
<transcript>: spread

04:39:35
<transcript>: Spread the word.

04:39:35
nexxeln: vercel was winning hearts of js devs, now they want to woo the rust devs

04:39:41
teej_dv: "hey, we make dev tools. would you like to have dev tools that are fast or slow?"

04:39:42
texoport: long term play building tech for blogs :o

04:39:42
<transcript>: Instead, I will ask, what color pants you're wearing. I like it. That'd be more fun to answer. At least be different. Right.

04:39:46
<transcript>: Ts. Still here. Rust is always worth it.

04:39:50
<transcript>: 51% rest already good at good efforts there.

04:39:50
<transcript>: this is

04:39:55
<transcript>: This is how you bring out the sleeping restace. You just talk about rest.

04:39:56
teej_dv: they're only goal is GET AS MANY DEVS USING YOUR TOOL

04:39:59
<transcript>: Okay, welcome to Chat Norlok.

04:40:02
<transcript>: norloka was

04:40:02
<transcript>: norloka was win

04:40:09
<transcript>: Norloka was winning Hearts of JS says now they want to woo the rest of hey, we make Dub tools. Would you like to have DevTools that are fast or slow.

04:40:16
<transcript>: Longterm Play Building Tech for blogs.

04:40:20
<transcript>: That's such a good burn that's such a good next. Js. Brown.

04:40:24
<transcript>: Their only goal is get as many devs using your tool.

04:40:26
<transcript>: Tie.

04:40:26
<transcript>: you don't have to tell me

04:40:27
<transcript>: You don't have to tell me.

04:40:30
<transcript>: And my chat.

04:40:30
<transcript>: but

04:40:34
<transcript>: But like, would you know if prime is considering a job at Verse cell.

04:40:34
<transcript>: i was kind of

04:40:41
<transcript>: I was kind of like laying out some breadcrums breadcrumbs. Like a theoretical case here for how prime might actually consider it.

04:40:46
<transcript>: And how this, like Dev culture would just like explode.

04:40:46
<transcript>: in gleeful

04:40:50
<transcript>: In gleeful joy if prime, when to Versaille.

04:40:50
<transcript>: but i was

04:40:51
teej_dv: hmm, I think I would probably know

04:40:54
tiredbeaver: there's no way primeagen would get payed as much as he does at vercel

04:40:56
nexxeln: prime is totally gettting hired by vercel

04:40:57
<transcript>: But I was making the case really like how much verselle would probably love to have prime because I talked about how I don't think Versell has.

04:40:57
<transcript>: very very

04:40:57
teej_dv: 👀

04:41:03
<transcript>: Very, very good. I think there Debriel is lacking in personality. Something that prime has a lot of.

04:41:03
<transcript>: so if

04:41:07
<transcript>: so if you could write rust and be himself

04:41:07
<transcript>: like

04:41:10
<transcript>: Like publicly for Versaille. That would just be a very good thing for them.

04:41:10
nexxeln: okay teej is just confirming it LUL

04:41:17
<transcript>: What is the eye, emoji? Do you know things? Teach you? Do you know things.

04:41:17
<transcript>: there's no

04:41:20
delvoid: i feel that was a big fat yes

04:41:20
<transcript>: There's no way Promising would get paid as much as he does.

04:41:20
<transcript>: at versaille

04:41:22
<transcript>: At Versaille.

04:41:32
<transcript>: Are you saying tired? You're saying he would get paid more at Netflix? I mean, Netflix pays well. You're saying he'd get paid more at Versaille? I mean, they'd back a Brink's truck to hire.

04:41:34
<transcript>: Prime. Right.

04:41:38
<transcript>: Oh.

04:41:38
<transcript>: tee

04:41:40
<transcript>: Teej.

04:41:42
teej_dv: LUL chat getting Jebaited

04:41:43
<transcript>: Oh, I'm so curious if you know something.

04:41:45
<transcript>: There's just no way.

04:41:51
tiredbeaver: no im saying he wouldn't get paid as much as netflix pays

04:41:53
<transcript>: Else. Why else do they fly them out there? I just. I just.

04:41:53
<transcript>: i know

04:41:56
jamdotexe: Easy bait, nice

04:41:58
<transcript>: I know. That's what? They're glad that's their plan. I just wonder what prime thinks of it.

04:42:09
teej_dv: i would probably know, but I would not say anything in chat that would make it clear whether I knew or not. that'd be such a low blow to prime

04:42:17
<transcript>: He wouldn't get paid as much as Netflix Pays. I'm sure I'm sure Versaille would make sure he got taken care of. We got to do this. We've got we got a model. Now let's play with it. I think it's the same model we had earlier, though. What did I change? Did I change anything? I don't think I changed anything.

04:42:17
<transcript>: we

04:42:20
teej_dv: I doubt vercel could/would match his netflix $$ tho

04:42:24
<transcript>: We just got it back to working, and I was excited about it, but we should actually train a larger, better model, right.

04:42:28
tiredbeaver: @teej_dv +1

04:42:28
<transcript>: I guess Let's.

04:42:31
<transcript>: Let's just see it through.

04:42:31
<transcript>: we'll gener

04:42:33
<transcript>: We'll generate some terrible images.

04:42:46
<transcript>: I would probably know, but I would not say anything in Chat that would make it clear whether I knew or not. There'd be such a low blow to prime. No, totally agree. I doubt Versel could Wood matches Netflix money, though really.

04:42:46
<transcript>: favorite

04:42:49
<transcript>: Favorite TJ raised like $350,000,000.

04:42:54
<transcript>: I would think they would pay whatever.

04:42:54
<transcript>: i know

04:42:56
<transcript>: I know. Netflix is like.

04:43:00
<transcript>: Top of the top in terms of their compensation, but like.

04:43:00
<transcript>: for

04:43:04
texoport: Him having to write React for Netflix might make him consider Vercel

04:43:05
teej_dv: i'm just saying, i know what prime is making at netflix and i'd be surprised LUL

04:43:08
<transcript>: For a smaller company like Versaille. And what someone like prime does for them and how many problems that solves, why not.

04:43:08
<transcript>: just saying i

04:43:11
<transcript>: Just saying, I know what prime is making it Netflix. And I'd be surprised.

04:43:13
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't know.

04:43:13
<transcript>: maybe

04:43:16
<transcript>: Maybe maybe yeah, maybe.

04:43:20
<transcript>: There's no chance for them to compete, but.

04:43:20
<transcript>: i mean

04:43:23
<transcript>: I mean prime agreed to go to next Conf.

04:43:24
<transcript>: conference

04:43:25
<transcript>: Conference.

04:43:25
<transcript>: maybe you just

04:43:27
<transcript>: Maybe you just want to go hang out.

04:43:41
<transcript>: Him having to write React for Netflix might make him consider Versell. That's another good point. It just dries me crazy knowing what Teege probably knows right now.

04:43:41
<transcript>: convers

04:43:46
<transcript>: Conversations and back alleys that teach us had but.

04:43:46
<transcript>: prime has

04:43:48
lotuspixiee: @texoport  truueeee

04:43:49
<transcript>: Prime has been publicly complaining about a project right.

04:43:49
<transcript>: at netflix

04:43:55
<transcript>: At Netflix that he's having to do. I mean, like I say, complaining not like as much as prime could ever complain.

04:43:59
teej_dv: i mean... his company ships a lot of JS stuff. i don't think it's weird that he goes there. he's gone to node.js conf and others

04:43:59
tiredbeaver: there's no way he's leaving netflix

04:44:03
<transcript>: This is taking so long.

04:44:05
<transcript>: What is it doing.

04:44:13
<transcript>: Four path of the model in G drive.

04:44:18
texoport: wasn't prime originally a JS boi?

04:44:19
<transcript>: Is this? It is in G Drive. Yeah.

04:44:19
<transcript>: okay

04:44:21

04:44:56
<transcript>: it's not bad

04:44:58
<transcript>: It's not bad.

04:44:58

<transcript>: It's not bad.

04:44:59
<transcript>: it

04:45:07
uberrick: going back to JS reminds you how great Rust is :D

04:45:07
<transcript>: It's not the worst model we've made. I don't know what's different than the first model, but I mean, it's better, it's more, it's cashuring, it better.

04:45:10
<transcript>: So there's the armor at the Beach.

04:45:15

texoport: OCaml for life

04:45:34
<transcript>: I know it's not gonna handle, like, stylized stuff very well. In fact, we need to do that. Let's just do ukjperson.

04:45:36
uberrick: Hey all btw, how you getting on with DreamBooth?

04:45:37
<transcript>: Painting.

04:45:44

<transcript>: he's

04:46:15
<transcript>: He's gone to know JS. Confident others? Yeah, that's good point. There's no way he's leaving. Netflix.

04:46:26
<transcript>: how do you think

04:46:33
<transcript>: How do you think we're getting on with Dream Booth? That's Guillermo as a Rembrandt painting. This is pretty good, actually.

04:46:33
<transcript>: okay

04:46:42
<transcript>: Okay. What would be what would be like? Okay, so we need to start, like, capturing some of these images. I feel like the model still probably not that great. Like we could do better, but.

04:46:42
<transcript>: these look pretty

04:46:44
<transcript>: These look pretty good.

04:47:01
<transcript>: Somehow this is better than our first model. And I'm not sure why, because I think it's the same number of steps in the same everything else. Look at this.

04:47:01
<transcript>: look at

04:47:03
<transcript>: Look at Guillermo.

04:48:13
<transcript>: Curriculum. And then we need to come up with funny stuff that we want to do.

04:48:18
<transcript>: For next. Jesskoff, we gotta have like some photos to put on the Internet, right.

04:48:25
<transcript>: I don't think there was an artist called Bepe. I don't think they either do weird prompts for content.

04:48:48
<transcript>: Like source graph. Oh, really? That's where you work, right? Teach they hire they don't consider.

04:48:49
tayloreddev: I think I would struggle to break into Go/Rust and still command the same salary. I've no professional experience. I tinker with them in side projects.

04:49:56
<transcript>: We gotta do we got to do better.

04:50:07
<transcript>: Let's retrain it and we'll still have this model like it's saved? We got the checkpoint saved? I'm gonna start to retrain? Then I got a pee? I'm dancing, I'm dancing.

04:50:12
<transcript>: Ted Dances let's try 1200 and let's try a hundred Class images.

04:50:20

texoport: All the companies I looked at doing Rust were in crypto

04:51:22
tayloreddev: does seem big in crypto space

04:51:28
uberrick: yeah but come with "3 years crypto experience" lol

04:51:42
uberrick: has anyone been doing it professionally for that long? haha

04:51:53
teej_dv: yes, it turns out that when you're writing code that literally controls all the money your company is doing things with, corrctness is useful

04:51:54
uberrick: probably

04:52:11
texoport: Coq for crypto pog

04:52:16
jamdotexe: Requires 3 years of [Insert brand new technology here] experience

04:52:23

04:58:20
<transcript>: there's a

04:58:23
<transcript>: There's a classical version you'll hear on occasion.

04:58:26

<transcript>: It does.

<transcript>: secure okay

04:58:36
texoport: is it available to stream somewhere?

04:58:41
<transcript>: Secure. Okay, let's go back to my screen. We retrained the model. Did it work.

04:58:41
<transcript>: no

04:58:42
<transcript>: No.

04:58:42
<transcript>: kuda error

04:58:44

04:58:48
<transcript>: This thing is is.

04:58:48
texoport: I love descending chromatics so much lol

04:58:50
<transcript>: Not consistent.

04:58:59
<transcript>: Well is it because the output do we need to let.

04:58:59
<transcript>: clear

04:59:05
<transcript>: Clear the output directory or something. I don't think that's. No, I don't think that's it.

04:59:12
<transcript>: Don't like that we can all ever create one model.

04:59:21
<transcript>: Kuda air like we haven't even Googled this thing.

04:59:24
<transcript>: We should try that right.

04:59:27
<transcript>: We should at least Google it.

04:59:33
<transcript>: If you're if you're just joining us.

04:59:33
<transcript>: next

04:59:35
<transcript>: Next yes. Comp.

04:59:35
<transcript>: we're gonna be doing

04:59:37
<transcript>: We're gonna be doing a little watch party.

04:59:47
proteinasek: HeyGuys

04:59:49
<transcript>: In an hour and a half. Is that what we're at hour and a half, 1 hour, 30 minutes. We have all of the new Docs spoiler spoiler alert.

04:59:49
<transcript>: if you don't

04:59:55
<transcript>: If you don't want to be spoiled, you don't spoilers for next. Jess. Comp. Get out of here. Get out of here.

04:59:55
<transcript>: we've got

05:00:00
<transcript>: We've got the new docs for Turbo Pack to be announced.

05:00:00
<transcript>: successor

05:00:04
<transcript>: Successor to Web Pack. We've got all the docs in our browser.

05:00:08
<transcript>: Before they took it down and we could look at them.

05:00:12
<transcript>: So like, this is fun. We've been reading.

05:00:12
<transcript>: the reading

05:00:23
<transcript>: The reading lots of things about the new thing Dev server I have read all these pages yet. Ooh environment variables what they do turbo Pack will parse and inject in files out of the box. Of course it will.

05:00:28
<transcript>: This includes all the Variations You saw Come In. Yes.

05:00:33
<transcript>: Not only that the turbo pack will lock live reload when these values change feels good.

05:00:40
<transcript>: That's an annoying thing that you don't normally get.

05:00:40
<transcript>: environmental

05:00:44
<transcript>: Environmental variables will be injected into process. In, for example, data.

05:00:44
<transcript>: sol

05:00:56
<transcript>: Solves the tradition of Node JS webpack Five, and X has twelve each. Use Process M for variable injection, so nothing real like groundbreaking here, but you will get live reload of your environment variables that feels good.

05:00:59
<transcript>: That's better than not getting library load.

05:01:05
<transcript>: Text support. Is it available to stream somewhere.

05:01:07
<transcript>: No, I think that.

05:01:07
<transcript>: brain master

05:01:20
<transcript>: Brain Master does put all of his music eventually on Spotify. Like all the things he does for all the podcasts and stuff it'll eventually make it to Spotify. I don't think he's put my stuff up there yet, but I'm sure it'll make it there eventually.

05:01:29
<transcript>: Let's look at imports. Turbo Pack supports Common JS and ESM Imports outobox and offers partial support for AMD.

05:01:29
<transcript>: turbo

05:01:37
<transcript>: Turbo Pack bundles your application. Whose is do people still use? Amd? I don't know. I wish everything was ESM as much as this been painful. I just wish we were all there.

05:01:42
<transcript>: Turbo Pack Bump bundles your application so imports won't be resolved to native browser.

05:01:43
thdxr: I use an AMD cpu

05:01:57
<transcript>: You can learn why in our Bundling versus Native VSM. Section. Common JS Turtlebex supports the Require syntax out of the box. So you just do that. We also support dynamic Require syntax if you want to import a dynamically named asset, okay.

05:01:59
<transcript>: Cool.

05:01:59
<transcript>: esm

05:02:00
<transcript>: Esm.

05:02:00
<transcript>: importing

05:02:05
jamdotexe: AMD has come a long way in recent years, not that I use it

05:02:05
<transcript>: Importing the import syntax also support out the box. It includes static assets and import type.

05:02:05
<transcript>: okay

05:02:06
<transcript>: Okay.

05:02:06
<transcript>: dynamic

05:02:10
<transcript>: Dynamic Imports Turbocheck Support dynamics inboard.

05:02:15
<transcript>: No big surprises.

05:02:33
<transcript>: What's? What's the CSS CSS bundling is handled by SWC using a rust crate called SWC CSS. We haven't yet documented SWC's CSS separately, but it's integrated into our pack and supports several CSS features, global CSS, Importing CSS and developer out of the box in trouble back.

05:02:33
<transcript>: css module

05:02:42
<transcript>: Css modules Turn backandle CSS modules out of the box. Any file with a module CSS extension will be considered a CSS module, and you can import it into a JavaScript or file.

05:02:49
<transcript>: This follows the same rule set out by Next JS, letting you easily distinguish between global and scope. Tss.

05:02:49
<transcript>: post

05:02:52
<transcript>: Post CSS nested terber regular.

05:02:54
<transcript>: Boxes.

05:02:57
<transcript>: Lets you nest CSS circuit inside each other.

05:02:57
<transcript>: okay

05:02:58
<transcript>: Okay.

05:03:13
<transcript>: I just hate all this stuff. How about Tailwind? Let's talk about that. Wind currently don't support Tail and CSS out of the box since it can be used as a PostUS plugin will likely support it through the plugin system. It can be used today by using a sidecard process. Bummer.

05:03:16
<transcript>: Mega bomber.

05:03:18
<transcript>: Spoiler.

05:03:20
<transcript>: And bummer.

05:03:24
<transcript>: Wrapped in one. It's a bummer, spoiler.

05:03:28
<transcript>: You gotta have to use a sidecard process for tailwind CSS.

05:03:30
<transcript>: With concurrently.

05:03:30
<transcript>: ew

05:03:32
<transcript>: Ew.

05:03:39
<transcript>: Ew this reeks of leg didn't get to it in time. Should've didn't that's a bummer.

05:03:39

<transcript>: Just read the room. You know, this should have been prioritized above. Like most of all the other stuff.

05:03:50
jamdotexe: No Tailwind!

05:03:53
tiredbeaver: dang adam ripping them apart

05:04:00
<transcript>: Like library load on environment variables. That's cool. But like everyone uses tailwind, right? Is that elitist to say, do people not use tailwind? I don't know. This has been resurfacing on Twitter. There are people not using tailwind. Why.

05:04:00
<transcript>: who hurt

05:04:03
<transcript>: Who hurt you? Why don't you use tailwind.

05:04:03
<transcript>: i'm not

05:04:07
<transcript>: I'm not like you should always use this thing kind of guy.

05:04:07
<transcript>: but you should

05:04:11
<transcript>: But you should always use tailwind. I guess I am that kind of guy.

05:04:15
jamdotexe: I use Tailwind on most projects, yep. Can't say I am proud of it, but yep!

05:04:15
<transcript>: I use an AMD CPU.

05:04:15
<transcript>: different

05:04:21
<transcript>: Different AMD, right? It's come a long way in recent years. Not that I use it. No tailwind.

05:04:21
<transcript>: i'm not i'm not

05:04:26
trout_soda: I always use utility classes, not always Tailwind

05:04:28
whoa_dood: strong tailwind opinions

05:04:31
<transcript>: I'm not. I'm not ribbon. Am I ribbon so far? No, it's just. It's a bummer to me that like every project I use next. Yes, I'm gonna have to install concurrently and do this stuff.

05:04:31
<transcript>: i can't just

05:04:33
uberrick: be proud of using Tailwind

05:04:51
<transcript>: I can't just use the builtin Dev script, which is like normally, just like Next Dev. Now I gotta do concurrently. Next thing I have Turbo plus post CSS input CSS outputs. This is watch. Ew. Ew. Ew. That's a step backwards. I guess I could not use Turbo pack, but then what am I getting? Tell me what I'm getting with Next S 13 and necklace.

05:04:51
<transcript>: conf

05:04:54
<transcript>: Conf sorry I gotta calm down.

05:04:56
<transcript>: Css.

05:04:56
<transcript>: and

05:04:59
<transcript>: And less SCSS.

05:05:04
<transcript>: Do people use this stuff? I'm sorry. Do people use it honestly.

05:05:16
<transcript>: Is this built? Oh no, don't currently. Okay. I thought they were like supporting this and not tailwind. Okay, plugins in the future. So workaround for posttos.

05:05:21
<transcript>: Cycar process. Bum er, bummer.

05:05:23
uberrick: did you see that anti TW tweet haha

05:05:24
<transcript>: Do people do this? Like do people like.

05:05:29
<transcript>: Do the modules thing. I don't know. I'm bummed.

05:05:36
nexxeln: im back

05:05:41
nexxeln: whats the bummer?

05:05:42
<transcript>: I always use utility classes not always to end strong tail and opinions I do have Shaun tail and opinions my strong talent opinions are you should be using tailwind.

05:05:42
<transcript>: it's just better

05:05:44
<transcript>: It's just better.

05:05:49
<transcript>: Let's talk about it. Let's talk about why it's better. Why am I? Why am I so passionately.

05:05:49
<transcript>: for tailwind

05:05:50
trout_soda: meta CSS langs are huge still. especially in non-Node envs. but yeah this is targeted at Next users where it's not as popular I guess

05:05:50
<transcript>: For tailwind.

05:05:54
<transcript>: Because I spent.

05:05:57
<transcript>: Whatever five years.

05:06:00
<transcript>: Like everyone knows the only hard things.

05:06:00
<transcript>: in programming

05:06:12
<transcript>: In programming are naming things and cash invalidation. We all know that meme. But there's truth like it's true, right? Thank you for the follows. I'm sorry I missed him 28 minutes ago. Cr for.

05:06:12
<transcript>: r three v

05:06:16
<transcript>: R, Three V, and Lotus Pixie Behind the horizon.

05:06:16
<transcript>: esteruna

05:06:21
<transcript>: Esteruna and CzechA. I missed all these. Thank you so much, everybody, for the falls. Now.

05:06:21
<transcript>: if i

05:06:25
<transcript>: If I owe and thank you Avidorous to follow if I may.

05:06:25
<transcript>: i spent

05:06:29
<transcript>: I spent a long time trying to name CSS classes.

05:06:29
<transcript>: nam

05:06:35
jamdotexe: When Tailwind became a thing, it solved a lot of issues for me. Probably reasons that CSS could solve if I was more proficient with design

05:06:35
<transcript>: Naming things is hard, and I spent so much of my career naming CSS classes.

05:06:35
<transcript>: and

05:06:37
abradores: Hello everyone

05:06:45
<transcript>: And you don't have to do that with tail end and all the complaints about tail end or just nonsense. I mean, they're not nonsense, but they're just unfounded like.

05:06:45
<transcript>: since

05:06:46
thesirfry: idk every time I see a practical tailwind example it's some html elements with a mile long list of classes on it and it looks messy af

05:06:54
<transcript>: Since when do we care what our HTML files look like? Everyone wants to point to like some long string. That's a bunch of class names. I mean, there's solutions to that.

05:06:54
<transcript>: if

05:06:57
<transcript>: If your problem is that it just like looks bad.

05:06:57
<transcript>: there's some

05:07:00
thesirfry: I do care though lol

05:07:02
<transcript>: There's some solutions to that, but it's better in so many ways if you're working.

05:07:02
<transcript>: in your thing

05:07:07
nexxeln: why tho?

05:07:13
<transcript>: In your thing. A component, a page. You do care. Oh, let's talk about it. I don't know. Every time I see a practical tail and example, it's some HTML elements of the myelong list of classes looks messy. Yeah. So.

05:07:13
<transcript>: it looks

05:07:15
<transcript>: It looks messy.

05:07:15
<transcript>: but imagine

05:07:23
whoa_dood: i think theo nailed it with people who like tailwind and people who havent tried tailwind yet

05:07:23
thesirfry: readability

05:07:26
<transcript>: But imagine like, you're working in the thing and you can style the thing and you don't have. And I guess that's the argument for CSS and JS and I don't have like, I never really.

05:07:26
<transcript>: i guess i

05:07:35
<transcript>: I guess I wasn't doing frontend development during that like big period of Emotion style components and all that. I was probably mostly doing back and stuff at statmes.

05:07:35
<transcript>: so i

05:07:38
nexxeln: once you know tailwind its more readable than your BEN classes LUL

05:07:40
<transcript>: So I maybe missed out on a lot of pain, all that world. And I guess their argument was sort of like.

05:07:40
<transcript>: your

05:07:43
<transcript>: Your designing while you're building the thing.

05:07:43
<transcript>: in your component

05:07:47
nexxeln: BEM*******

05:07:51
<transcript>: In your component. I don't know, but with tailwind, there's no context switching. You're not jumping into style files, and I guess you can have multiple buffers open at once. Like whatever.

05:07:57
trout_soda: heh that "moment" was like yesterday in the long history of CSS shenanigans

05:08:04
<transcript>: But the biggest thing for me is I don't have to name classes anymore. I don't have to name like weird file names conventions or class naming conventions with like underscores and type of thing and prefixes.

05:08:04
<transcript>: i can just not do

05:08:06
<transcript>: I can just not do any of that. And it feels really good.

05:08:06
<transcript>: and i just

05:08:20
<transcript>: And I just feel like I thought that was just so much more prevalent. I thought, just everybody used to win now, and we all just kind of knew that was easier. I don't say like, you should use a thing because I get something out of it or because.

05:08:20
<transcript>: i want to

05:08:20
is_matt: Hold overs from 2005-2007 when xhtml/accessibility was a big deal everyone kind of cared about it, that stopped though lol

05:08:22
<transcript>: I want to validate.

05:08:22
<transcript>: oh i feel

05:08:26
<transcript>: Oh, I feel good using it because all these other people use it. I say it because I don't want you to do things that are painful.

05:08:26
<transcript>: and i think

05:08:28
<transcript>: And I think.

05:08:28
<transcript>: no

05:08:38
uberrick: yeah you get used to reading it. Plus creating core components abstract the classes used away

05:08:41
<transcript>: Nontail win CSS is painful. I've learned so much about CSS just from using tailwind. I don't feel like I missing out, like I'm abstracting away things I should learn. I feel like I'm learning CSS because I used to win. Okay, I'm done.

05:08:49
<transcript>: But I feel like it's not as universal as I thought it was. Hello, Abradoras. Welcome to chat.

05:08:53
<transcript>: When Taylor became thing let's see, I'm just I'm backing up here.

05:08:53
<transcript>: mitoc

05:08:53
nexxeln: the big win comes in the maintainability imo, maintaining css is hard, its so scary to edit .css files

05:09:13
<transcript>: Mitocs lengths are huge still, especially in nonnode environments. But yeah, this is targeted next users where it's not as popular. I guess when Tel McCain is saying it solves a lot of issues for me, probably reasons that CSS could solve. If I was more proficient with design, there's another like I should call out. I've not stayed on top of like the latest Cynthia CSS. So if they've solved.

05:09:13
<transcript>: some of these problems

05:09:14
<transcript>: Some of these problems.

05:09:20
<transcript>: I don't think there's any way, though, that they solve the naming problem.

05:09:21
<transcript>: It's kind of inherent.

05:09:24
<transcript>: Did they.

05:09:24
<transcript>: i don't

05:09:28
<transcript>: I don't know? Every time I see a patch or two? Oh, yeah, I read that do care. Yeah, I get it.

05:09:28
<transcript>: i think

05:09:33
<transcript>: I think Theo nailed it with people who, like tail end and people who haven't tried tailwind yet.

05:09:38
<transcript>: I don't think I've seen that co take readability once you know, tail end it's more readable than.

05:09:38
jamdotexe: indigo-500 everything

05:09:41
<transcript>: Your Bin BIM classes.

05:09:41
<transcript>: yeah

05:09:48
<transcript>: Yeah, I have no problems reading talent, but I mean, I've been doing tailwind for a while, so maybe that's it.

05:09:48
<transcript>: that moment

05:09:58
<transcript>: That moment was like yesterday in the long history of CS Shenanigans holdovers from Toast five, seven. When accessible is a big deal, everyone kind of cared about it, then stopped.

05:10:00
<transcript>: Yeah, you get.

05:10:05
<transcript>: Big win comes in the main tenability in my opinion maintains CSS is hard Yes.

05:10:05
<transcript>: it's so scary

05:10:12
<transcript>: It's so scary to edit. I mean, I think it's faster at all time too. I think tailwind is faster and oftentime and it's way easier to make.

05:10:13
abradores: I feel in every front end project, nobody really cares about styling , css , Semantic HTML, accessibility, SEO, ecc. I feel like someone who knows how to architecture CSS and even design, can bring a lot of value to a front end team. I feel like I SHOULD get better with it. Thoughts?

05:10:16
<transcript>: Anyway.

05:10:22
is_matt: You know...tailwind also makes design accessible for non-designers/experts

05:10:23
thesirfry: How do you handle managing all of those tailwind classes dynamically? I don't mean just adding a disabled class either.

05:10:26
<transcript>: I feel in every front of project. Nobody really cares about styling, CSS, Semantic, HTML, Accessibility, SEO, etc. I feel like someone who knows how to architect CSS.

05:10:26
<transcript>: and even

05:10:32
<transcript>: And even design can bring a lot of value to a frontend team. I feel like I should get better with it. Thoughts.

05:10:36
<transcript>: Yeah, no, I would say.

05:10:36
<transcript>: like

05:10:37
<transcript>: Like building.

05:10:37
<transcript>: front

05:10:57
<transcript>: Front ends based on like designs you find on the Internet, dribble or something. I think that's a super valuable thing to develop, like just being able to take a given design. If you ever start working on a team and their designers are handing you stuff, or they're working in Figma or whatever. And you want to like, practice just building.

05:10:57
<transcript>: suspect

05:11:01
isbatak: but instead of naming classes, we are naming components, especially when we are building multipart components.

05:11:03
<transcript>: Suspect like building interfaces based on designs have been provided to you I think that's Super.

05:11:03
<transcript>: useful

05:11:05
nexxeln: @TheSirFry clsx or classnames. not sure what you mean exactly by dynamic classes

05:11:09
<transcript>: Useful skills to develop in terms of actually designing stuff that's a whole nother thing like.

05:11:09
<transcript>: if that's what you're saying

05:11:10
<transcript>: If that's what you're saying.

05:11:10
<transcript>: learning

05:11:14
<transcript>: Learning, design, it's useful. And I think like.

05:11:14
<transcript>: the people who

05:11:19
<transcript>: The people who brought you tailwind? So Adam Watson's got refactoring UIs really good.

05:11:20
abradores: we have a big multinational in agricolture. We do not have designers.. xD

05:11:28
jamdotexe: There is definitely value in CSS experts, however, at work, we don't have time for that. It's all about profitable functionality, depends on the use case I suppose

05:11:30
<transcript>: Even just like buying I think just buying tailwind UI and just looking at all the components they made until when you I think that's super helpful for learning how to structure components and all that.

05:11:30
<transcript>: tail

05:11:34
<transcript>: Tailan also makes design accessible for non designers, experts.

05:11:34
<transcript>: how do you handle

05:11:39
<transcript>: How do you handle managing all those tailored classes? Dynamically? I don't mean just adding a Disable class either.

05:11:42
<transcript>: I use the class names pattern.

05:11:43
uberrick: yeah think that's what he means @nexxeln you can create a function which will combine default classes with additional classes depending on state

05:11:49
<transcript>: So class names. Okay. I'm gonna move back over here.

05:11:52
<transcript>: Class name.

05:11:54
<transcript>: Like.

05:11:56
<transcript>: This is probably an article about it.

05:11:57
texoport: @nexxeln tailwind-styled-components has been pretty nice for getting typesafe reusable components using tailwind

05:12:00
<transcript>: It's just a little package that allows you to do like condition.

05:12:00
<transcript>: let me see

05:12:02
<transcript>: Let me see here.

05:12:07
nexxeln: ohh thats lame @texoport

05:12:08
<transcript>: I thought it would be.

05:12:09
nexxeln: use cva

05:12:15
<transcript>: They might just be using the word class names here.

05:12:15
<transcript>: there's like

05:12:17
<transcript>: There's, like a little tiny package. Oh, yeah. Here we go.

05:12:19
nexxeln: class-variance-authority

05:12:19
trout_soda: I rather like `twind` in Deno

05:12:21
<transcript>: There's no examples here.

05:12:32
dedadev: clsx(a, b)

05:12:40
<transcript>: I mean, it's so simple is to be true. That like you can literally just write a tiny function that does what it does. But you can like provide boolean stuff, right conditions to render these classes only when this thing is Truthy or not render it with Falsey, that kind of thing.

05:12:43
<transcript>: So I use that a lot.

05:12:43
<transcript>: for conditional

05:12:46
<transcript>: For conditionally rendering classes or not.

05:12:46
<transcript>: instead of nam

05:12:53
<transcript>: Instead of naming classes, we're naming components. Especially when you're building multi part components. Yes. Welcome to Chat. Is Vatic. Is Betek.

05:13:01
<transcript>: Yeah, we are naming component. I think you're saying that's a good thing. I think this is an argument for tailwind, right.

05:13:08
nexxeln: mewtru is gonna give a talk on cva today at nextconf!! @texoport

05:13:08
<transcript>: Clsx classmates. Yeah, yeah. Next. I'm way behind. We have a big multinational and agriculture. We do not have designers.

05:13:15
<transcript>: Definitely value in CS experts. However, at work we don't have time for that. It's all about profitable functionality. Depends on the use case.

05:13:16
texoport: @nexxeln oh yeah that looks better

05:13:19
<transcript>: Function which is combined debug classes. Yeah, Yeah.

05:13:21
<transcript>: Okay.

05:13:21
<transcript>: till

05:13:21
thesirfry: @UberRick yeah it is

05:13:26
<transcript>: Till in style components has been really pretty nice for getting type safe for usable composers using tailwind.

05:13:31
<transcript>: Okay. I can't keep up so.

05:13:31
<transcript>: mutual

05:13:36
<transcript>: Mutual is gonna give a talk on CVA today at Next Golf. Whoo can't wait.

05:13:41
<transcript>: Yes. So tailwind.

05:13:44
<transcript>: Tailwind is very helpful.

05:13:44
<transcript>: i think

05:13:47
<transcript>: I think it doesn't slow down.

05:13:47
<transcript>: your learning

05:13:51
nexxeln: im using cva for my next project

05:13:52
<transcript>: Your learning of CSS. I think I learned CSS faster with tailwind.

05:13:56
nexxeln: im loving it a lot

05:13:59
<transcript>: Yeah. The lack of context switching, the lack of like mental load of having the name classes.

05:14:08
<transcript>: This is great. So you build components. Those components get reused. That's kind of the same concept of reusing classes and see ifs you just componentize everything.

05:14:08
<transcript>: i love it

05:14:17
<transcript>: I love it. I love tailwind and you can do some crazy powerful stuff too arbitrary variants and stuff now that you couldn't always do.

05:14:17
<transcript>: i don't know

05:14:21
<transcript>: I don't know. It's. I think it's the perfect styling.

05:14:21
<transcript>: approach

05:14:22
<transcript>: Approach.

05:14:22
<transcript>: and

05:14:24
<transcript>: And it's a bummer.

05:14:24
<transcript>: that we're gonna have

05:14:31
texoport: I've already done like 10 HUGE refactors on my platform already so tail sc -> cva isn't a big deal lol

05:14:31
thesirfry: it doesn't seem to bad

05:14:32
<transcript>: That we're gonna have to run a sidecar to build our tailwind in next JS turbo pack or turbo pack.

05:14:32
<transcript>: whatever

05:14:39
nexxeln: oh thats like remix dev server

05:14:39
<transcript>: Whatever. I don't know the new thing that's coming. We're looking at it right now. Spoiler, spoiler alert. We're looking at it right now.

05:14:43
<transcript>: It's not. I mean, it's not a huge deal.

05:14:44
nexxeln: using concurrently

05:14:54
<transcript>: Yeah, it's like remixeper. It's not a huge deal, but it's like now you have to use concurrently. It's just, I always love when like, my scripts are so simple. Like when my Dev script is just pnpm run.

05:14:54
<transcript>: next

05:14:56
<transcript>: Next Dev or whatever.

05:15:01
is_matt: Used tailwind on a couple blazor pbojects, sidecars are so much maintenance :(

05:15:06
<transcript>: Like when this is just next, Dev feels good. And if I had to add a turbo flag, fine. But now we're doing this. It's not a big deal.

05:15:06
<transcript>: functionally

05:15:08
<transcript>: Functionally. It'll be the same. It's just.

05:15:11
<transcript>: Your package JSON is ugly.

05:15:11
<transcript>: for a while and tell

05:15:14
<transcript>: For a while and tell they incorporate it.

05:15:28
<transcript>: Okay, so not a big deal. I made a big deal about it. It's not a big deal. Turbo Hack plants offer first class support for multiple frameworks, no matter what, no matter whether you're using Salt, React, View, or another framework. When a product experience on Turbo pack.

05:15:34
nexxeln: ^^ this tbh

05:15:37
<transcript>: It's the compiler, JavaScript and types of code. Extremely fast, blazingly fast compilation if you will.

05:15:37
<transcript>: similar

05:15:42
<transcript>: Similar to Next Year Pack doesn't require you to import React in order to use JSX. Yep.

05:15:48
trout_soda: wonder why they didn't opt to use an existing build tool? why re-write? because not written in-house?

05:15:51
<transcript>: Yep. Yep. Okay. React Server Components let you declare certain components as server components, allowing you to run back in code inside an Async function.

05:15:51
<transcript>: next to

05:15:52
nexxeln: one of the problems that seems solved but isn't is package.json scripts

05:15:54
<transcript>: Next to 13. Brings first class support. What is this link.

05:15:56
<transcript>: What is this link.

05:15:56
<transcript>: is it

05:15:57
jamdotexe: I think they will add it in as a new "killer" feature

05:15:58
<transcript>: Is it public.

05:16:00
<transcript>: Oh.

05:16:03
<transcript>: Can I log in with Versaille.

05:16:08
<transcript>: Please give it to me let's check the let's check the way back machine.

05:16:08
<transcript>: right

05:16:09
<transcript>: Right.

05:16:16
<transcript>: Nope.

05:16:20
<transcript>: Not there.

05:16:24
<transcript>: They're not public. Everyone. These docks aren't public.

05:16:26
<transcript>: Just want to make sure that was clear.

05:16:30
<transcript>: Oh, it's focused.

05:16:33
<transcript>: Use tailwind on a couple Blazers.

05:16:33
<transcript>: side cards

05:16:35
<transcript>: Side cards are so much maintenance.

05:16:46
<transcript>: Wonder why they do not opt to use an existing build tool. Why rewrite. We read it. There was a big thing about it.

05:16:46
<transcript>: because

05:16:50
<transcript>: Because not written in house. No, I think the head valid reasons.

05:17:01
<transcript>: One of the problems it seems solved. It isn't is package JSON scripts. That's another good call. Think they will add it in as a new killer feature.

05:17:05
<transcript>: I think they probably want to get it done. They did get it done in time.

05:17:05
<transcript>: i think

05:17:08
<transcript>: I think Tailwind Support was a myth.

05:17:08
<transcript>: but

05:17:12
<transcript>: But we read the Y Turbo pack.

05:17:12
<transcript>: i don't think

05:17:19
<transcript>: I don't think I can do that. Actually, I can't open it like that. That's a 404, but I can click it because it didn't. My browser cache.

05:17:19
<transcript>: they

05:17:26
<transcript>: They explained here why Bundling is faster than native ASM, and how they wanted to be as fast as they build.

05:17:26
<transcript>: but

05:17:32
<transcript>: But they also wanted to do caching and all this stuff so they have reasons.

05:17:37
<transcript>: Okay, so server components.

05:17:45
<transcript>: Impose unusual constraints on your bundler. The mix of client and server code means you need to ensure that server code is not get compiled to compliant. Vice versa.

05:17:45
<transcript>: turbine

05:17:51
<transcript>: Turbine is built from the ground up to solve these problems, it works with React server components out of the box.

05:17:51
<transcript>: okay

05:17:56
<transcript>: Okay, Next TurboX Alpha version has been focused on providing a great experience for Next to its Dev server.

05:17:56
<transcript>: we're using this as

05:18:02
<transcript>: We're using this as our initial goal to show that what tour of that can do in the future Metro area it's low for other frameworks.

05:18:02
<transcript>: it needs a

05:18:13
<transcript>: It needs a turbact. Everything in Next JS. Next Dynamic is not yet supported. Oh, interesting. How are we planning to sport it out of the box soon? Okay, so you can't use Next dynamic.

05:18:15
<transcript>: In Turbo pack.

05:18:18
<transcript>: Okay. So.

05:18:18
<transcript>: so there's some

05:18:25
<transcript>: So there's some like gotchas here, right? You have to opt into Turbo Pack. It's only for Dev, not for your Prod builds.

05:18:28
<transcript>: You can't use next dynamic.

05:18:30
<transcript>: Good to know.

05:18:38
<transcript>: It's really fast. It does caching in memory only not stored to disk.

05:18:43
<transcript>: And tailwind. No tail, insulin support.

05:18:43
<transcript>: at launch

05:18:44
<transcript>: At launch.

05:18:44
<transcript>: what about

05:18:46
<transcript>: What about.

05:18:46
<transcript>: part of

05:18:54
<transcript>: Part of Bundling for the Web is handling all the asset types to Web, support, images, videos, JSON fonts, and much more. Oh, the font thing, though. We saw the font thing. That was cool.

05:18:54
<transcript>: where was

05:18:56
<transcript>: Where was that.

05:18:56
nexxeln: next dynamic is so useful, can't use turbopack yet i guess :(

05:19:02
<transcript>: Where is that? Do I still have that in a tab? If I close that tab, I'm done.

05:19:04
<transcript>: Did I close it.

05:19:15
<transcript>: So that closes it. No. Here it is. New package next. Yes. Font batteries included. Does all the things use a Google Font get best.

05:19:15
<transcript>: everything

05:19:16
nexxeln: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/font

05:19:18
<transcript>: Everything optimized to the nines.

05:19:18
<transcript>: selfhosted

05:19:20
<transcript>: Selfhosted love it.

05:19:29
<transcript>: Oh, I think they will add in next. Dynamic is so useful. Can't use server pack yet, I guess. Yeah, that's awesome.

05:19:34
<transcript>: When I read that, it's like, Well, not using this. It launch. So that's a bummer.

05:19:34
<transcript>: i did

05:19:36
<transcript>: I did pull.

05:19:36
<transcript>: i had no reason

05:19:41
<transcript>: I had no reason to think I wouldn't use Turbo back up until that small little.

05:19:41
<transcript>: line

05:19:47
<transcript>: Line where next dynamic is not. I don't think I have a project where I don't use next dynamic.

05:19:50
<transcript>: So I guess I can't use turbo pack.

05:19:57
<transcript>: For the Follows Green tea.

05:20:00
<transcript>: And Rect. 404.

05:20:00
<transcript>: that's funny

05:20:03
<transcript>: That's funny. Because right now, all these docks.

05:20:03
<transcript>: they'll

05:20:06
<transcript>: They'll 404 for you.

05:20:06
<transcript>: you try and

05:20:16
<transcript>: You try and open them, but we got them in my browser. Cash, don't worry, I got you. Oh, yeah? We're gonna see if we can figure out this error and get a new model, right.

05:20:22
<transcript>: Okay, so what's the problem here? Maybe I should search Google Colab.

05:20:42
texoport: search with pytorch and not colab

05:20:44

05:21:16
<transcript>: Earlier study time. I was talking about how I just wanted the word to get out. That if I ever raid you, you don't have to ask me what I was working on. So I'm not gonna ask you what you were working on. I know what you were doing. I've watched your streams.

05:21:16
<transcript>: but i'm not trying

05:21:19
gabrielmedeirosz: mama mia

05:21:27
<transcript>: But I'm not trying to be rude, but I'm asking. I just don't like when people ask me because I don't know what I'm working on most of the time. It's all random stuff, but I have to worn all of you huge raid. Lots of people here.

05:21:27
<transcript>: i

05:21:29
texoport: adam, what are you working on?

05:21:32
<transcript>: I've been spoiling we're doing some like next jazz. Comp spoilers if you don't want.

05:21:32
<transcript>: to spoil

05:21:38
<transcript>: To spoil next JS. Comp you're gonna watch it later and you don't want any any leaks.

05:21:38
<transcript>: then you should probably

05:21:49
<transcript>: Then you should probably leave. Thank you for coming, but you should probably leave because we're gonna talk about some stuff, and it's top secret. It's not public. Okay? Got that out of the way. Thank you so much. We've got some Eddie.

05:21:49
<transcript>: we're excited

05:21:54
<transcript>: We're excited. We're trying to train TensorFlow model, not TensorFlow.

05:21:54
<transcript>: we're trying to

05:21:55
kutford: Tabs!

05:21:58

05:22:06
<transcript>: tomorrow

05:22:07
<transcript>: Tomorrow.

05:22:07
<transcript>: and decide

05:22:09
<transcript>: And decide whether you want to stick around.

05:22:12
<transcript>: Circuit with Pytrch, and not Colab. Okay.

05:22:15
<transcript>: So let's do this.

05:22:19
<transcript>: We've got an error. We're trying to retrain the model.

05:22:23
<transcript>: And we can't seem to retrain it.

05:22:33
texoport: the discuss.pytorch link is what you want

05:22:36
<transcript>: And this potentially has answers. Now I'm not going to keep up with chat. Welcome to my chat. All of you that have Typed things in.

05:22:36
<transcript>: i normally

05:22:40
<transcript>: I normally would call out each one, but there's too many and I can't.

05:22:54
<transcript>: Topseekers. Okay. So some people have said they're okay with they're okay with the top secret stuff. So I'm gonna start talking about it shortly. I want to give more time for people to leave. If they don't, they don't want spoils or they just don't look at my face.

05:22:58
<transcript>: Now's a good time because we're gonna start talking about some stuff.

05:22:58
<transcript>: some

05:23:01
<transcript>: Some top secret stuff. We got some docs that we shouldn't have access to.

05:23:01
<transcript>: here in my browser

05:23:05
<transcript>: Here in my browser, and we're gonna pull them back up very shortly.

05:23:05
<transcript>: thank you again study

05:23:06
caldotjs: Was at the vet for 2h did I miss something important :O

05:23:08
<transcript>: Thank you again. Study time for the raid. I really appreciate it.

05:23:16
<transcript>: Kalbat you missed. I don't know what you missed in 2 hours. Honestly, I don't know when we started with the big leaks.

05:23:21
<transcript>: Oh, Texa Port. Thank you. The Discuss Pi torch link is what I want.

05:23:21
<transcript>: this one

05:23:22
<transcript>: This one.

05:23:27
<transcript>: Okay.

05:23:33
<transcript>: So, Caldot, we have been looking at some docs for some stuff.

05:23:33
<transcript>: for next year

05:23:37
<transcript>: For next year's. Comp. And we're gonna start talking about it again very shortly.

05:23:40
<transcript>: So the spoiler alert.

05:23:40
<transcript>: it's

05:23:43
<transcript>: It's coming up in like an hour and a half.

05:23:43
<transcript>: hour

05:23:46
caldotjs: nooo pytorch forums.. I am getting flashbacks to my thesis :D

05:23:49
texoport: not this one exactly, but you're going to find  your solution in a discuss.pytorch link

05:23:50
<transcript>: Hour. Just an hour away now. So it's not a big spoiler. It's like kind of a little tiny spoiler. Just an hour early.

05:23:57
<transcript>: I guess tech. So if you see the answer and you just know what I should be doing here.

05:23:57
<transcript>: there

05:24:00
<transcript>: There's a lot of information that doesn't make any sense to me.

05:24:10
texoport: Just use a different Pytorch version lol. It's usually that

05:24:11
<transcript>: It's sounds like it's not even getting access to the GPU. Maybe.

05:24:11
<transcript>: in the

05:24:12
<transcript>: In the notebook.

05:24:15
<transcript>: Maybe.

05:24:21
<transcript>: How we saw this earlier mismatch of dimensions.

05:24:21
<transcript>: okay i'm

05:24:25
<transcript>: Okay. I'm not gonna pretend like I understand anything about machine learning.

05:24:29
<transcript>: You're gonna find my solution on discussion. Pytorch. Gotcha.

05:24:29
<transcript>: thank you for the

05:24:32
<transcript>: Thank you for the follows Tigris.

05:24:32
<transcript>: and

laytanl_: @caldotjs Is your dog ok?

05:24:33
<transcript>: And.

05:24:37
<transcript>: Scotchy. Oh, and Gabriel.

05:24:39
<transcript>: Thank you so much.

05:24:46
<transcript>: So there's some we're triggering some people with these docs. Okay, let's talk next. Js.

05:24:46
<transcript>: turbo

05:24:58
<transcript>: Turbo Pack is coming. This is a spoiler. You'll find out in an hour you want to just get out of here now. Turbo Pack Y Turbo Pack so it's a replacement for Web Pack. It's a successor to Web pack.

05:24:58
<transcript>: and it's written

05:25:02
<transcript>: And it's written in Rust, so it's super fast.

05:25:12
<transcript>: They explain why they didn't just use Veet because some people are like, why not just go with the community here? Vet is great.

05:25:12
<transcript>: could we just use that

05:25:31
<transcript>: Could we just use that? But they explain. No, it's not great. It doesn't scale well for big projects. That's the thesis. Here why they created Turbo Pack. Not to be confused with Turbo Repo, which is being rewritten and rest and eventually will merge forces with Turbo Pack. And there will be one thing called Turbo. And it'll do everything you need.

05:25:31
<transcript>: all of

05:25:35
<transcript>: All of your build stuff, all of your mono repost stuff.

05:25:35
<transcript>: all of it

05:25:36
<transcript>: All of it.

05:25:36
<transcript>: so

05:25:38
<transcript>: So they talk about.

05:25:38
<transcript>: some

05:25:44
<transcript>: Some of the kind of like implications here. We just looked at this.

05:25:44
<transcript>: there

05:25:44
texoport: @caldotjs same lol. Nothing like digging into the pytorch forums ~5 times a day

05:25:56
<transcript>: There's no support for Next Dynamic, so some of us will not be using Turbo back on launch. It's only for the Dev server they're not launching with support for the production builds yet.

05:25:56
<transcript>: so it's an

05:26:07
<transcript>: So it's an Alpha mode turbo pack silvery early just for your Dev server and only if you don't use next dynamic. And if you use tailwind CSS like me and I thought everybody, but apparently not.

05:26:07
<transcript>: they

05:26:10
<transcript>: They have to use a sidecar with concurrently. It's not the bummer.

05:26:14
<transcript>: Okay. So.

05:26:14
<transcript>: we're not gonna

05:26:19
<transcript>: We're not gonna get this thing to retrain, are we? We're just stuck with the model that we have.

05:26:19
<transcript>: that's kind of what i'm

05:26:25
<transcript>: That's kind of what I'm getting. It's not a very good model, but we can do some things like.

05:26:31
<transcript>: Painting of Ukj person in the style of we didn't do.

05:26:34
<transcript>: The Castle. We could try that.

05:26:36
dedadev: doing backflip

05:26:42
<transcript>: So Guillermo is the founder of her cell. Next JS Conf if you're not tracking.

05:26:47
<transcript>: Verselle creates next Yes.

05:26:47
<transcript>: gear mo

05:26:51
texoport: these prebuilt "presentation" notebooks aren't the easiest to debug, to say the least

05:26:52
<transcript>: Gear Mo is the founder and CEO and we took a bunch of photos of him.

05:26:52
<transcript>: and we

05:26:55
<transcript>: And we trained this Dream Booth model.

05:26:55
<transcript>: to create

05:26:59
<transcript>: To create other things. Other portraits of Guillermo.

05:26:59
<transcript>: in hopes that we could have

05:27:01
<transcript>: In hopes that we could have some fun stuff.

05:27:07
<transcript>: For next JSConf, but the model's not very good and we can't get it to retrain that's a bummer.

05:27:10
caldotjs: he is a handsome man

05:27:20
<transcript>: Handsome man. That's right, Caldat. And looks pretty good in the Picasso. This is a pretty awesome. What am I talking about? There's nothing Picasso about. This, is there.

05:27:20
<transcript>: our model

05:27:22
<transcript>: Our model's just not very good.

05:27:22
<transcript>: like i feel like

05:27:24
<transcript>: Like I feel like we can basically choose.

05:27:24
<transcript>: any

05:27:25
<transcript>: Any.

05:27:25
<transcript>: any artists

05:27:31
<transcript>: Any artists here and they all kind of look the same, don't they? Thanks much for follows. Jenka.

05:27:33
<transcript>: And Tigris.

nexxeln: riding a jetski wearing black sunglasses

05:27:46
<transcript>: It's very flaky. That does look different than the first one. That's pretty good. Is that what Monet paintings look like? I don't even know.

05:27:52
<transcript>: If I can loan any paintings anybody.

05:27:57
<transcript>: Who here is like an art history buff.

05:28:01
<transcript>: So this is Monet. I mean.

05:28:01
<transcript>: i guess

05:28:04
<transcript>: I guess I'm getting Monet vibes.

05:28:04
<transcript>: what do we think

05:28:06
<transcript>: What do we think? Yeah.

05:28:12
<transcript>: I don't know what's going on with the thumb there.

05:28:16
caldotjs: @laytanl_ he was feeling really bad on the weekend. throwing up an coughing constantly. He got some injections and now he got a follow up injection and some more painkillers. But its nothing dangerous (fortunately). Just stealing his and my sleep :D

05:28:19
<transcript>: It's like a Versaille Prism. There going on if you look at the Versaille Pages right now.

05:28:22
<transcript>: I've got this whole Prism theme going.

05:28:22
<transcript>: right

05:28:24
<transcript>: Right.

05:28:25
laytanl_: The soup throwers in your results LUL

05:28:25
texoport: oh wait, "ukj in the style of an ayahuasca painting"

05:28:31
caldotjs: @caldotjs it's the worst! but people over there are generally really helpful

05:28:34
<transcript>: If I didn't mention earlier, we're gonna be watching. We're doing a little watch party for Next JF. Comp. So if you stick around for another hour, hour and two minutes, we're gonna watch it. Watch the Keynote Live together.

05:28:41
<transcript>: I'm pretty excited. I've been pretty excited about next. Jess. Comp for like weeks. So today's a big day.

05:28:41
<transcript>: i think

05:28:45
<transcript>: I think these are usable. I think we could actually take one of these.

05:28:45
<transcript>: we're gonna

05:28:46
<transcript>: We're gonna download it.

05:28:49
<transcript>: Monet.

05:28:56
<transcript>: And what else? Artists we did Vango earlier, and I think it was pretty good.

05:28:56
<transcript>: that seems

05:28:58
<transcript>: That seems to get some of them.

05:29:01
<transcript>: It seems to work with some of them.

05:29:05
<transcript>: If we could retrain the model, maybe we could make it better.

05:29:05
<transcript>: but

05:29:09
<transcript>: But we can't so that's pretty good. Oh, that's really good.

05:29:12
texoport: @caldotjs Spent far too long debugging issues with pytorch geometric. do not recommend lol

05:29:14
<transcript>: Then go.

05:29:19
<transcript>: These are great.

05:29:24
texoport: that was when it wasn't polished at all, ~4 years ago

<transcript>: Okay. What else could we try? We could try the.

05:29:33
<transcript>: let's see

05:29:35
<transcript>: Let's see.

05:29:35

texoport: ukj person ayahuasca painting RIP

05:29:55
<transcript>: If it handles this, it didn't handle it earlier. Yes, you actually can request on calf face. I would love some prompts. Throw some prompts.

05:29:59
<transcript>: Ukj in the style of.

05:29:59
<transcript>: an ay

05:30:02
<transcript>: An Ayah. I'm not gonna try and say that I will try that prompt.

05:30:06
nexxeln: i requested one too

05:30:08

05:30:08
<transcript>: how you

r3ktt404: try banksy artist

05:30:12
<transcript>: How you know something about cow dots dog.

05:30:14
<transcript>: Simply.

05:30:15
caldotjs: @laytanl_ thank you very much! sens00Love

05:30:28
<transcript>: That's a good idea. Yeah. Hit me with Banksy artists. That's good, too. Yeah? Hit me with all your prompts.

05:30:35
<transcript>: Okay. So it doesn't handle.

05:30:35
<transcript>: doesn't

05:30:39
<transcript>: Doesn't handle the fortnight. That's like the closest.

texoport: furry ukj

05:30:46
<transcript>: But I've seen some I don't know if you've seen like Vincent. Geez, I've got my.

05:30:48
<transcript>: Vincent.

05:30:58
<transcript>: Dreamer works at Meta. He's been doing these. These Dream booth photo. They're incredible. He's clearly very good at training the models.

05:31:02
<transcript>: Yeah.

05:31:03
laytanl_: he said he was at the vet for 2 hours, so I figured it must have been his dog @adamdotdev

05:31:05
caldotjs: have you seen the stuff levels built with it?

05:31:10
<transcript>: Oh, we haven't tried anime. We could try that with this model, but like, look at this stuff. I mean, these are just nuts. Like that's what he looks like.

05:31:10
<transcript>: but with

05:31:12
<transcript>: But with all that stuff on.

05:31:18
<transcript>: And he's done it with a bunch of deaths from around the community. They're just all so good.

05:31:24
<transcript>: Like that's a for night. Look at that. Jason langsorf.

05:31:27
<transcript>: In Fortnite. Pretty great.

05:31:31
<transcript>: Levels. Yeah. So Levels did like the.

05:31:35
<transcript>: Like interior design? Right.

05:31:35
<transcript>: uk

05:31:40
<transcript>: Uk. Let's do Cyberpunk and then we'll try Banksy.

05:31:42
<transcript>: So you could see person.

05:31:42
<transcript>: let's see

05:31:44
<transcript>: Let's see, painting.

05:31:44
<transcript>: or maybe

05:31:48
<transcript>: Or maybe Cyber Pumpkin painting.

05:31:51
<transcript>: Of Yuk person I don't know.

05:31:51
<transcript>: not

05:31:56
<transcript>: Not I'm not a prompt engineer.

05:31:56
<transcript>: so if you have

05:32:02
<transcript>: So if you have, like, whole prompts, like exact prompts you want to send me, they'll probably be better than whatever I put in here.

05:32:07
<transcript>: What do we think.

05:32:07
<transcript>: that looks

05:32:10
<transcript>: That looks Cyberpunk at all. I don't think it does.

05:32:10
<transcript>: although i

05:32:13
<transcript>: Although I gotta be honest, I don't know what Cyberpunk would look like.

05:32:18
<transcript>: That's kind of cool.

05:32:26
<transcript>: Thor's custom. We'll try that.

05:32:27
laytanl_: I read that you should be very detailed in your prompts

05:32:35
<transcript>: Oh, I got you. He said it was the vet. I missed that. I'm sorry if your dog's sick.

05:32:44
<transcript>: Read that you should be very detailed. Near prompts. Yeah, I've seen some crazy. Let's just do this dream. Boo booth. Props. Let's just try this.

05:32:53
<transcript>: I feel like somebody has got a list of good props, right.

05:33:04
<transcript>: My Dream Photos with prompts and training settings. Where is the prop.

05:33:07
<transcript>: Am I missing it.

05:33:16
<transcript>: I feel like there should be a big list somewhere. Right.

05:33:21
<transcript>: Things that have worked for people.

05:33:25

05:33:39
<transcript>: Can someone find me? We're gonna do the Banksy artist thing. Can someone find me a list.

05:33:41
<transcript>: A list of prompts.

05:33:45
<transcript>: Real training example.

05:33:53
<transcript>: Token and class.

05:33:53
<transcript>: a phot

05:33:57
<transcript>: A photo of Yep, Man, etc.

05:34:03
<transcript>: Try training with other step count. Oh, this is all very helpful.

05:34:06
<transcript>: Pretty good at 2000 2500 steps.

05:34:06
<transcript>: looks

05:34:09
<transcript>: Looks like you're getting a major roles at 4000.

theruggedbear: hello everyone! Damn Adam, 5 hours stream ? finite6ClarklioBrow

05:34:37
<transcript>: Always referred your subject as object in person, yet we got that.

05:34:46
<transcript>: Some full body and some upper half.

05:34:53
texoport: @theruggedbear it hasn't even started yet bec next conf lol

05:34:54
<transcript>: A lot of portraits, including half profiles. The effect is that the portraits look similar, but the shape of the skull is often not mine.

05:35:04
cowfacedude99: @theruggedbear it's gonna be even longer LUL

05:35:05
<transcript>: So did I. Maybe my training data was just bad, too. Like we had mostly here's. Our here's, our fellows. I feel like all ours are mostly busts, right.

05:35:07
<transcript>: I.

05:35:12
<transcript>: 'm let's see.

05:35:22
<transcript>: Yeah, no Ruckin Bear, we've been going 5 hours. We're gonna we're streaming all day. I mean, we're streaming till next JSK off. We're gonna watch the keynote and then our probably be done at that point.

05:35:33
<transcript>: I wonder if this is just bad training data. There's a lot of similar like he's in the same clothes and most of them.

05:35:40
sinamobasheri: hey be careful about THE 📦 BOX

05:35:44
theruggedbear: is that Guillermo ? Kappa

05:35:45
<transcript>: Because we just took these frames from a video. That's probably a bad idea. We should probably try training with fewer images, even if we could even reach we can't retrain it. That's such a bummer. Let's try the Banksy thing. Just us painting.

05:35:50
<transcript>: View KJ person in Banksy.

05:35:54
<transcript>: Thanksy, Thought it is Germano.

05:35:54
<transcript>: we're

05:35:56
<transcript>: We're trying to make.

05:36:02
<transcript>: A Dream Booth Model of Gearmo for Next Desk Cost Banks The artist.

05:36:02
<transcript>: should just

05:36:04
<transcript>: Should just try Banksy side.

05:36:06
<transcript>: Let's try that.

05:36:11
<transcript>: I need prompts, and I need Hyperparameter settings.

05:36:13
texoport: ukj person in the style of an ayahuasca painting zz

05:36:15
<transcript>: I need it to work. Just increases time.

05:36:31
<transcript>: I think I have too many photos. I think I have too many similar photos. Let's try, let's try cutting down the number of photos and maybe no black and white. I don't know.

05:36:36
<transcript>: We don't have any full body though.

05:36:40
<transcript>: If I like those are those.

05:36:40
<transcript>: i mean

05:36:44
<transcript>: I mean those are barely passed away.

05:36:50
<transcript>: Okay. I'm gonna do, like.

05:36:53
<transcript>: These.

05:36:58
teej_dv: teej_dv in the style of a vscoder

05:36:58
<transcript>: One.

05:37:02
<transcript>: That's black and white, but.

05:37:06
<transcript>: Go with this one.

05:37:15
<transcript>: Okay. Maybe just those. Let's just try. Just those.

05:37:17
<transcript>: What do you think.

05:37:21
<transcript>: Let's try it.

05:37:21
<transcript>: nine of them

05:37:23
<transcript>: Nine of them.

05:37:27
<transcript>: We'll see if it even is able to it may not be able to retrain.

05:37:31
<transcript>: Tiege in the style of a vs. Coder.

05:37:38
<transcript>: That's funny. So here's Banksy. Does that look like Banksy art? I think our models just kind of bad. Oh, that actually looks like Bang. See.

05:37:38
<transcript>: that does

05:37:41
<transcript>: That does, doesn't it.

05:37:46
<transcript>: That kind of does. Thanksy. Do I even spell it right.

05:37:50
<transcript>: That's not bad, right.

05:37:59
<transcript>: This isn't an awful model. It's just not. I think it's not as good as it could be.

05:37:59
<transcript>: let's

05:38:04
<transcript>: Let's try with different images. So I'm gonna delete all these.

05:38:05
laytanl_: @teej_dv you did a lot of AI art, right?

05:38:06
r3ktt404: second one is good :)

05:38:08
<transcript>: Delete folder.

05:38:11
<transcript>: Or I'll just rename it right.

05:38:13
<transcript>: Rename.

05:38:15
laytanl_: also with dreambooth?

05:38:15
<transcript>: Og.

05:38:16
texoport: ukj person in the frontpage of a newspaper for being the first person to make contact with UFOs

05:38:18
<transcript>: And then we'll create a new folder.

05:38:23
<transcript>: Ukj.

05:38:26
<transcript>: Okay, let's upload.

05:38:30
<transcript>: Just.

05:38:30
<transcript>: oh no

05:38:32
<transcript>: Oh, no, I didn't want to do that.

05:38:35
<transcript>: Canful.

05:38:39
<transcript>: Let's see.

05:38:42
<transcript>: I need to actually extract it.

05:38:49
<transcript>: Okay, there's our nine frames. We're just gonna use these this time and see if it retrains even.

05:38:49
<transcript>: upload

05:38:50
<transcript>: Upload.

05:38:57
<transcript>: Okay.

05:38:59
<transcript>: And then I guess.

05:39:02
<transcript>: Do we go back to 800 steps.

05:39:02
<transcript>: i really

05:39:04
<transcript>: I really want to train with more steps.

05:39:04
<transcript>: but

05:39:12
<transcript>: But not so many. We did it earlier with like 50. That was two mini. We'll see 50 class images which is the original.

05:39:16
<transcript>: Is it done uploading? I guess. Yeah.

05:39:16
<transcript>: let's

05:39:20
<transcript>: Let's try it, we'll try it.

05:39:27
<transcript>: Also with Dream booth.

05:39:39
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, yeah. We need to do the that Ayah Hushka painting. We'll try that texto. I'll just do that while it's training, so we can run that bottom part, right.

05:39:45
<transcript>: You can do a person in the front page of a newspaper for being the first person to make contact with UFOs.

05:39:48
<transcript>: That's a very specific.

05:39:54
<transcript>: Let's see if this is gonna train it's not trace back.

05:39:56
<transcript>: Bomber.

05:40:01
<transcript>: I feel like if I just keep smashing the button, maybe eventually it just works.

05:40:06
<transcript>: Let's try that.

05:40:10
<transcript>: Name I don't know how to pronounce painting.

05:40:12
<transcript>: In.

05:40:14
<transcript>: That style.

05:40:23
<transcript>: I really wish we could get it to retrain. That'd be great.

05:40:23
<transcript>: maybe i guess

05:40:32
<transcript>: Maybe. I guess the obvious changed is we have like output now. Maybe I need to delete the output directory. What is it? Directory.

05:40:36
<transcript>: Up here.

05:40:39
<transcript>: Here we go.

05:40:39
<transcript>: wait

05:40:44
<transcript>: Wait will be saved at content drive my drive Stable fusion weights SK s.

05:40:44
<transcript>: so

05:40:46
<transcript>: So stable.

05:40:46
<transcript>: where is

05:40:49
<transcript>: Where is that? Data? Now, drive my drive.

05:40:54
<transcript>: Stable diffusion with.

05:40:57
<transcript>: Sks.

05:40:57
<transcript>: okay

05:40:59
<transcript>: Okay. So maybe if we.

05:40:59
<transcript>: well it should

05:41:02
<transcript>: Well, it should be a different folder than that, right.

05:41:06
<transcript>: Should be a different folder.

05:41:16
<transcript>: Because we're doing 1200 steps so that doesn't make any sense. I don't think that's the issue.

05:41:19
<transcript>: Let's see what that painting looks like. Whoa.

05:41:19
<transcript>: does this look like

05:41:22
<transcript>: Does this look like that artist? I don't know. The artist.

05:41:22
<transcript>: does that

05:41:24
<transcript>: Does that look like it.

05:41:31
<transcript>: Let's see.

05:41:34
<transcript>: Is this.

05:41:34
<transcript>: their art

05:41:35
<transcript>: Their art.

05:41:38
<transcript>: This.

05:41:42
<transcript>: I mean, I see the resemblance.

05:41:42
texoport: search for "ayahuasca paintings"

05:41:48
<transcript>: Paintings. That's a good call.

05:41:57
<transcript>: Oh Yeah.

05:41:57
<transcript>: that's

05:41:59
<transcript>: That's cool, very colored.

05:42:02
<transcript>: And does it look like this.

05:42:03
texoport: They're weird

05:42:06
<transcript>: No.

05:42:15
<transcript>: Okay, let's try that really long prompt that you sent texto.

05:42:15
<transcript>: in the newspaper

05:42:19
<transcript>: In the newspaper. I'm curious what that comes up with.

05:42:20
teej_dv: @laytanl_ i did some ya, but not really running anything for myself in a long time

05:42:22
<transcript>: I really wish we could get retraining to work.

05:42:22
<transcript>: it's just

05:42:24
<transcript>: It's just it's about.

05:42:27
<transcript>: 800. We could try.

05:42:31
<transcript>: Going back to the defaults.

05:42:34
teej_dv: just via mid journey and that openai one

05:42:35
<transcript>: I don't think that's the issue, though.

05:42:35
teassh: Hi, could you try "marcel nino pajot" artist?

05:42:41
<transcript>: Oh, wow. Look at that. He's in a newspaper.

05:42:44
<transcript>: There. He's not.

05:42:46
<transcript>: He's laying on top of a newspaper.

05:42:53
<transcript>: It's trying.

05:43:03
<transcript>: Are you sure.

05:43:06
<transcript>: That is it, Fraser.

05:43:10
laytanl_: gotcha

05:43:18
<transcript>: Or we could do anime. I don't know. I don't know what to do with prompts. Like, what do you think that prompt was.

05:43:27
<transcript>: Trying anime problems.

05:43:42
teej_dv: well maybe "ukj person" is not a good subject

05:43:51
<transcript>: Maybe ukj person is not a good subject. Maybe.

05:43:53
<transcript>: I think our model's not very good.

05:43:56
<transcript>: That's really scary.

05:44:03
laytanl_: what is a ukj anyway?

05:44:04
<transcript>: Yeah. I think our models just not very good. Okay.

05:44:07
<transcript>: 45 minutes.

05:44:20
<transcript>: Ukj I think I think it's just a unique prompt, like I think it's just meant to be like a unique token that won't leak into any other text tokens so that you can train your image.

05:44:29
<transcript>: To be associated with that token. And when that token shows up, it pulls that likeness. I think that's how it works. I'm not an Ml guy.

05:44:31
teej_dv: you need to probably say something much more specific? that's what I've done generally. Something like: "in the style of an anime by hayao miyazaki, richly detailed and bright colors"

05:44:43
<transcript>: I really do think they're like very specific prompts.

05:44:50
<transcript>: A dream booth prompt that I've seen that are Super Gnarly, and I feel like somebody has to have.

05:44:54
<transcript>: Like a list of them.

05:45:12
<transcript>: Okay.

05:45:16
<transcript>: Looking for Dream booth prompts.

05:45:16
<transcript>: oh

05:45:19
<transcript>: Oh, here we go.

05:45:28
<transcript>: There's prompts below each image here.

05:45:30
<transcript>: At Mount Fuji.

05:45:35
<transcript>: Okay. Let's try stuff like that with.

05:45:35
<transcript>: eiffel

05:45:38
<transcript>: Eiffel. Tower in the background.

05:45:43
<transcript>: Uk to Your version.

05:45:43
<transcript>: with

05:45:45
<transcript>: With iphone.

05:45:45
<transcript>: oh boy

05:45:49
<transcript>: Oh, boy power in the background? That I felt right.

05:45:58
<transcript>: Yes. And now El, did I do Al. No, I did it. Okay.

05:46:05
<transcript>: Need to probably say something much more specific. That's what I've done generally, something like in the style of an anime, but. Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay.

05:46:05
<transcript>: ooh

05:46:12
<transcript>: Ooh. Richly detailed and bright with colors. This looks awesome. Tej. That's what I'm talking about. I've seen some problems that just make no sense to me, though.

05:46:16
<transcript>: There's no Eiffel Tower in the background.

05:46:20
<transcript>: Oh, there is kind of.

05:46:24
<transcript>: So you could.

05:46:29
<transcript>: Style of an anime by that Rich's detail and bright colors. Let's try that.

05:46:29
<transcript>: yeah i don't

05:46:36
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't know how much like stable diffusion prompts are the same. Like if they work for Stabilizing. Do they also work.

05:46:39
<transcript>: Their models just so much better.

05:46:44
texoport: I think this might be what you want https://prompthero.com/

05:46:49
<transcript>: What was this? One of anime.

05:46:52
<transcript>: Then looks more like an anime.

05:46:56
<transcript>: Is that actually how you would say an anime.

05:46:58
<transcript>: I know nothing.

05:47:02
<transcript>: Looks animeish.

05:47:06
<transcript>: So let's try some of these. Maybe.

05:47:06
<transcript>: johanne

05:47:09
<transcript>: Johannesvir. Mirror.

05:47:13
<transcript>: Rim, brambrant.

05:47:17

05:47:20

<transcript>: A mix. I tried to capture all possible expressions. Positions, distance, the camera, clothes.

05:49:36
<transcript>: I think they weren't good tips anymore.

05:49:37
teej_dv: you are generating stuff really fast... are you sure you're doing enough iterations and what not?

05:49:40
<transcript>: What's this? The difference.

05:49:40
<transcript>: maybe

05:49:42
<transcript>: Maybe.

05:49:42
<transcript>: generating stuff

05:50:02
<transcript>: Generating stuff really fast. Are you sure you're doing enough iteration and whatnot? Yeah. I tried teach. We did earlier. We did, like, 60 steps for 50 steps. And it was way overfitted, like it didn't take into in consideration any of the other factors in the prompt. It was like just pictures of him, basically. So I I don't know why that is. I don't know what else I might have done wrong.

05:50:07
<transcript>: Simple needs you to use so this one might be better.

05:50:07
<transcript>: we could try this

05:50:09
<transcript>: We could try this. Colab.

05:50:23
<transcript>: Thank you for the follows P, four Blicks and two dope for username and Jancha and Tiger I think I've said Tigers like three times.

05:50:23
<transcript>: where

05:50:26
<transcript>: Where is the Colab.

05:50:26
<transcript>: shouldn't there

05:50:29
caldotjs: AUTOMATIC1111 sounds good :D

05:50:29
<transcript>: Shouldn't there be like a link to the Colab.

05:50:36
<transcript>: For both Hlky and Automatic Web UIs Stabilizers, including officers.

05:50:44
<transcript>: All you have to enter your hugging Face token only once and you're all set. Go ahead and install Repos and models inside GDP drive.

05:50:48
<transcript>: Yeah, how do I use it? Simple needs to use.

05:50:56
<transcript>: So I click on this.

05:51:00
<transcript>: Now. Oh, yeah, that's it. Here we go.

05:51:00
<transcript>: let's do

05:51:02
<transcript>: Let's do this one. Let's try it.

05:51:11
<transcript>: Did we just do a prompt over here? Painted Michelangelo. Looks like a lot of our other just seems generic at this point. Like.

05:51:18
<transcript>: Just making paintings. Okay, let's try this Colab, though. Dream Booth. Colorab from that.

05:51:21
<transcript>: Setting of the environment.

05:51:24
<transcript>: Not authority. I get it.

05:51:28
<transcript>: Well, can you show me? Okay. So that's just sure.

05:51:28
<transcript>: download

05:51:32
<transcript>: Downloading the model. I have to put my token in here.

05:51:32
<transcript>: so

05:51:33
<transcript>: So we'll go fuzzy.

05:51:41
<transcript>: Automatic does sound? Does sound good.

05:51:43
<transcript>: Cal dot.

05:51:43
<transcript>: wait wait

05:51:46
<transcript>: Wait, wait. I'm about to get cancelled. Oh, Geez, what did I miss.

05:51:53
<transcript>: A lot of POS on the page.

05:51:54
<transcript>: Yet.

05:51:54
<transcript>: adult

05:52:04
<transcript>: Adult Content second Monitor gotcha you guys you called it cut. The VOD is just like a serious thing on Twitch. Did I just did I just commit a serious crime.

05:52:13
<transcript>: I gotta want to pull that stuff up on stream, but like from Twitch Standpoint, how bad are we talking? Teach? Do you know anybody know.

05:52:17
<transcript>: Automatic is the Web UI? Yeah, that's how that works.

05:52:18
teej_dv: i have no idea

05:52:21
homiecoder: @adamdotdev! hru caught ur stream + prompt crafting + nextconf + taco tuesday so dope! uh oh what happened?

05:52:21
caldotjs: as far as I know if someone snitches and reports you it could be quite ouchy

05:52:23
teej_dv: never looked at naked pictures on stream OMEGALUL

05:52:24
<transcript>: It's like you can. You can play with your model. You download your checkpoints.

05:52:26
<transcript>: Except the terms.

05:52:26
<transcript>: okay so i just

05:52:31
<transcript>: Okay, so I just need my hugging face token. I did this for a reason. Here it is. Copy it.

05:52:35
<transcript>: And paste it here.

05:52:35
caldotjs: @teej_dv Kappa

05:52:37
<transcript>: And then.

05:52:40
<transcript>: What else? That's it.

05:52:40
<transcript>: just click button

05:52:41
<transcript>: Just click button.

05:52:44
<transcript>: Okay.

05:52:46
<transcript>: Downloading.

05:52:53
<transcript>: I think I'm unfuzzy now.

05:52:54
<transcript>: And.

05:52:59
<transcript>: That's a good call out never intended to.

05:53:08
<transcript>: H Are you caught your stream plus Prompt crafting plus Neph. Comp let's Taco Tuesday, so dope.

05:53:08
<transcript>: oh what happened

05:53:15
<transcript>: Oh, what happened? So I was know someone sniffing and reports you. It could be quite ouchy. Oh, Geez, I didn't mean to do it.

05:53:15
<transcript>: in fact i

05:53:20
<transcript>: In fact, I need to close let me just close that tab. I'm gonna go fuzzy in case.

05:53:22
<transcript>: Oh.

05:53:25
<transcript>: Okay.

05:53:26
texoport: it was my fault argh

05:53:28
<transcript>: Unfuzzy.

05:53:32
<transcript>: We're still downloading the model now.

05:53:39
<transcript>: You're fine text up work.

05:53:39
<transcript>: we will

05:53:46
<transcript>: We will. We'll cut the VOD for future viewers sake, and we'll hope for the best. I don't know.

05:53:46
<transcript>: i mean

05:53:50
<transcript>: I mean, I'll serve my time. I'll do whatever I got to do. I'm sorry. Twitch.

05:53:50
<transcript>: i apologize

05:53:55
<transcript>: I apologize. I should have should have looked before I opened.

05:53:58
<transcript>: Before I clicked on things.

05:54:00
teej_dv: my guess is it's probably OK in this cause cause it was incidental and not sexually explicit material maybe?

05:54:01
teej_dv: idk

05:54:07
<transcript>: Dream Booth New Fast Method let's just see what this says. Views Skip the two cells below directly to the start. Dream Boost cell.

05:54:07
<transcript>: new

05:54:20
<transcript>: New method delivers the best roles with only 300 steps training on multiple subjects. Multiple subjects. I heard that you couldn't even do that with dream booth. If you accidentally run this all below, you need to run this cell again, but no need to re upload images uploaded. Okay.

05:54:28
caldotjs: "For those who present as women, we ask that you cover your nipples. ... Cleavage is unrestricted as long as these coverage requirements are met. "

05:54:30
<transcript>: Most important steps is to rename the instance picture. It's the same instance. Unique identifier for each subject example for 30 pictures yourself, simply select them all.

05:54:37
<transcript>: And rename only one to the chosen identifier. For example, that. Oh, Geez, what did I do.

05:54:37
<transcript>: what do i do

05:54:38
<transcript>: What do I do.

05:54:38
<transcript>: i was just

05:54:40
<transcript>: I was just showing me all the code in this step.

05:54:45
<transcript>: I collapsed. That back. Possibly.

05:54:49
developmentrobot: people get banned for glimpses of buttcracks... but twitch moderation is very unpredictable in how they enforce the rules

05:54:50
<transcript>: Is this done? I guess it's done. I don't see a check Mark, but.

05:54:55
<transcript>: I did. I showed my key. I always I always leaked things.

05:54:55
<transcript>: okay dream

05:54:59
<transcript>: Okay, dream booth. I wanna put that backwards.

05:54:59
<transcript>: you know

05:55:01
<transcript>: You know.

05:55:03
<transcript>: There we go.

05:55:03
<transcript>: so

05:55:08
<transcript>: So I don't have to keep track of your chain I'll pick any name if you're working session.

05:55:16
<transcript>: 30 pictures, simply select all of them and rename only one to the chosen Identifier files will be that.

05:55:16
<transcript>: that

05:55:21
caldotjs: a friend of me got banned for a week because he opened a link

05:55:25
<transcript>: That and then upload them do the same for other people or objects with a different Identifier and that's it. You can start training. Get the model under ten minutes for four to 500 steps.

05:55:31
<transcript>: Okay character object so training set is a.

05:55:34
<transcript>: Is a character.

05:55:34
<transcript>: with prior

05:55:36
<transcript>: With prior preservation.

05:55:36
<transcript>: results are better

05:55:42
<transcript>: Results are better. You will either have to upload around 200 pictures of the classroom training or let Dream Boots generate them.

05:55:51
<transcript>: Use a keywords included each instance images as unique instance prompt. This allows us to train on multiple subjects at the same time. I don't want to do that.

05:55:54
<transcript>: Subject type.

05:56:00
<transcript>: Would be a person.

05:56:12
<transcript>: Man, woman's shirt, car, dog, baby for training on a style. Oh, that's so cool. So you can actually do style transfer with Dream boots as well.

05:56:12
<transcript>: instance

05:56:14
<transcript>: Instance name.

05:56:19
<transcript>: Unique Identifier unknown by stabilifusion that's where the UKG comes in.

05:56:22
<transcript>: Okay. So Let's.

05:56:22
<transcript>: do this

05:56:23
<transcript>: Do this.

05:56:27
<transcript>: We need to I think we need more photos.

05:56:31
<transcript>: I think we need more. I think we don't have enough photos.

05:56:48
<transcript>: People got banned for glimpses Church moderation very unpredictable.

05:56:51
21_blu3: damn i like your beard lol

05:56:57
<transcript>: Friend ban for a week, okay, we're gonna hope that all doesn't pan out that way, but we'll see how long we got. What, 35 minutes.

05:56:57
<transcript>: to next js comp

05:56:59
21_blu3: veri nice, very cheap

05:57:02
<transcript>: To next JS. Comp 35 we are at 34 minutes, 3 seconds.

05:57:07
<transcript>: I think.

05:57:07
<transcript>: it's getting ready to

05:57:08
21_blu3: how long did it take you to get that length?

05:57:11
<transcript>: It's getting ready to start. I want to, like, have good photos of Gearmo.

05:57:11
<transcript>: we have

05:57:12
<transcript>: We have a few.

05:57:12
<transcript>: but

05:57:20
<transcript>: But I would like, I think we need more, better images. I don't know. We've scoured the web. This was kind of the best we got, right.

05:57:20
<transcript>: let's just use

05:57:22
<transcript>: Let's just use what we have on this model and just see if it works.

05:57:27
<transcript>: We need to open up another one of these.

05:57:31
<transcript>: Let's go into here let's rename these.

05:57:32
<transcript>: To.

05:57:34
<transcript>: Rename to.

05:57:36
<transcript>: Guillermo.

05:57:38
<transcript>: Frame.

05:57:42
<transcript>: Format.

05:57:54
<transcript>: Like this.

05:58:01
<transcript>: Hkj is that what they did? That seems like a thing that wouldn't be in the model, right.

05:58:03
<transcript>: Okay.

05:58:11
<transcript>: Hkj 123-45-6780. Okay. 17 of them. Oh, let's go back here.

05:58:20
<transcript>: I don't need to do that so subject type is going to be a man.

05:58:23
<transcript>: Instance name G.

05:58:23
<transcript>: k

05:58:24
<transcript>: K.

05:58:24
<transcript>: j

05:58:26
<transcript>: J. Is that what I said.

05:58:32
<transcript>: Hkj. What? Okay, let's redo that.

05:58:35
<transcript>: It's GK. Right, G, KJ.

05:58:41
<transcript>: Gkj? Okay.

05:58:41
<transcript>: instance

05:58:42
<transcript>: Instance Dur.

05:58:45
<transcript>: durable

05:58:47
<transcript>: Durable? What.

05:58:47
<transcript>: number of

05:58:50
<transcript>: Number of subjects, images.

05:58:55
<transcript>: Directly the folder instead of uploading. Leave empty to upload.

05:59:02
<transcript>: Oh, that's instant stir. Wait, what if the number of instance pictures is large? It's not.

05:59:07
<transcript>: Okay.

05:59:14
<transcript>: So I can leave that empty and then number of subject images. Yeah, we can do 200 save class images to GDrive. Sure.

05:59:16
<transcript>: Okay.

05:59:16
<transcript>: let's do it

05:59:20
<transcript>: Let's do it. Choose files only available in Sell is it executed.

05:59:20
<transcript>: all right

05:59:22
<transcript>: All Right. Here we go.

05:59:27
<transcript>: Here we go. It's gonna give us an upload.

05:59:27
<transcript>: but

05:59:31
<transcript>: But I have to choose the subject images, too. Right.

05:59:35
<transcript>: Where do I upload? Oh, class. Pictures, yeah, Yeah.

05:59:39
<transcript>: Okay. Choose.

05:59:39

<transcript>: Wait is subject. I may have gotten that backward.

05:59:42
<transcript>: is subject

05:59:43
<transcript>: Is subject.

05:59:50
<transcript>: Type man.

05:59:52
<transcript>: Training subject.

05:59:52
<transcript>: it's not

05:59:57
<transcript>: It's not instance images. Right. This is our subject images, which would be like the class images. Yeah.

06:00:03
<transcript>: I'm choosing am I choosing the instance images? I think.

06:00:03
<transcript>: okay

06:00:08
<transcript>: Okay. Folder. The class Pictures Truth of Dogs. You're training a dog. It's optional.

06:00:11
<transcript>: The Upper List of numbers.

06:00:11
<transcript>: automatic

06:00:17
<transcript>: Automatically generates the rest. So should we do this or should we just let them generate them? If you specify Clasher, which is following these customers.

06:00:20
<transcript>: Upload.

06:00:23
<transcript>: Do we want to generate them or not.

06:00:33
<transcript>: I'm gonna upload them whatever. I'm uploading them. We got 30 minutes, people, 30 minutes to next. Js. Comp.

<transcript>: Dan is great. I just wish you would look at me.

06:17:24
niftynate80: Dev Rel is a new term for Sales Engineer. But it may be a little more than SE

06:17:28

06:17:33
theruggedbear: @nexxeln lmao

laytanl_: devs are so awkward

06:18:11
kociqq: besides the docs

06:18:16
laytanl_: my god I am one of them

06:18:21
stiefbroerikzitvast: Turn around dan

06:18:22
teej_dv: LUL imagine not scripting these sections

06:18:27
caldotjs: thats some decent wholesome-cringe

06:18:44
teej_dv: ok, maybe vercel SHOULD poach me and prime

06:18:46
<transcript>: Cringe, I love it.

06:18:48
teej_dv: now that would be a pre-show adam could enjoy

06:18:55
jenswoeste: will we find out what his favourite color or cereal brand is?

06:18:56
<transcript>: Tees. They need you. They need your personalities so badly. And your rust chops, all of it. Near the whole package.

06:19:01
<transcript>: I would love the preshow. That would be fantastic.

06:19:03

laytanl_: neovim conf better

06:19:18
<transcript>: Yeah. Dance. Great. He's not. He's just talking. He's hanging out. He's literally not even acknowledging that he's on camera.

06:19:22
stiefbroerikzitvast: Star ansible should be the host

06:19:23
caldotjs: ^

06:19:24
teej_dv: "Hey Dan, have you ever heard of Dev Hour?"

06:19:27
<transcript>: This is a difference in a Devrel.

06:19:29
teej_dv: Dan: "oh no, i haven't. what's that?"

06:19:30
<transcript>: Devrels and Dan was the difference.

06:19:36
teej_dv: Me: "DEVOUR DEEZ NUTS"

laytanl_: @StiefbroerIkZitVast boink

teej_dv: DansGame but adam isn't there? DansGame

teej_dv: no, I think Jens is saying the way the host points

06:21:55
teej_dv: (maybe?)

06:21:58
<transcript>: So I am not saying I would do a better job in these people. I'm saying this job shouldn't exist.

06:21:58
<transcript>: it's so painful

06:21:59
<transcript>: It's so painful.

06:21:59
<transcript>: it's so painful

06:21:59
mezyoucef32: everyone weatring black

06:22:00
r3ktt404: Hey, when do the records of the conf usually come out?

06:22:01
<transcript>: It's so painful. And it's not their fault.

06:22:04
uberrick: The clapping brought to you by clap.js to ease the awkwardness

06:22:06
stiefbroerikzitvast: staran5Baninc staran5Shruk69

06:22:11
maleero: The Next thing for js is to use it to just bootstrap your WASM. LUL

06:22:15

caldotjs: wow. weird flex

06:22:41
thdxr: swixy

06:22:42
<transcript>: So many awkward, positive.

06:22:47
uberrick: Yeah, they should just have schedule and get right to it haha

06:22:47
<transcript>: Did anyone know where SWIX worked? I didn't remember.

06:22:49
laytanl_: that you know of LUL

06:22:56
teej_dv: it's like when you are texting someone who uses "..." randomly

06:23:02
niftynate80: Soft disagree @adamdotdev maybe medium

06:23:04
teej_dv: like: "hey, I'm... wondering what you're up to"

06:23:14
jenswoeste: SoMeManager career? really?

06:23:24
niftynate80: An ETL company

06:23:26
theruggedbear: @teej_dv why are you not there? You and Prime should make introductions

teej_dv: i'll go to next.rs

06:23:47
niftynate80: Wendy’s Twitter game

06:23:57

caldotjs: STOP THE CLAPPING

06:24:11
nexxeln: we know more than people in SF

06:24:15
theruggedbear: i'm still looking for Prime in the crowd

06:24:22
laytanl_: these cheers are killing me

06:24:27
uberrick: The crowd looks insane

06:24:28
caldotjs: Adam-Conf next year?

06:24:30
<transcript>: Did I say they didn't have personality? I said next.

06:24:30
<transcript>: versaille

06:24:35
<transcript>: Versaille. Devrel didn't have personality. I was so wrong. They have plenty of personality.

06:24:36
caldotjs: Amsterdam or Lissabon

06:24:41
<transcript>: Also live is so much harder than like prerecorded content.

06:24:58
kociqq: They are very good at it. I couldn't do that

06:24:58
nexxeln: we already did it for them LUL

06:24:58
<transcript>: Oh, it's so Apple.

06:25:02
<transcript>: The fastest.

06:25:02
<transcript>: ever

06:25:03
<transcript>: Ever.

06:25:07
laytanl_: Yeah nothing against these guys of course, just the awkward job and setting

06:25:16
theruggedbear: next rust ?

06:25:22
jenswoeste: rust for js devs?

06:25:24
laytanl_: and over-excitement

06:25:39
uberrick: Did his T-shirt just turn into a turtle neck?

06:25:44
texoport: next js 15: rust for frontend

06:25:58
caldotjs: @texoport yew *exists*

06:26:01
theruggedbear: if i'm going to see these two words: "blazingly fast"  in the keynote i'm gonna laugh so hard

06:26:08
jenswoeste: @texoport the frontend thats so fast the user cannot keep up

06:26:18
uberrick: It just nextjs becomes Svelte

06:26:19
thdxr: adam looks bored

06:26:26
thdxr: I'm in a meeting so watching on mute

06:26:28
texoport: "the TSC port didn't work so just use rust for FE"

06:26:29
caldotjs: @texoport you can simply not see it. If you miss it its your fault

06:26:39
oetziofficial: would be fun if they rename nextjs LUL

06:27:05
nexxeln: https://turbo.build/pack live now @adamdotdev

06:27:23
laytanl_: So they will have 2 talks at the same time?

06:27:30
<transcript>: Yes. Please. Please.

06:27:34
teej_dv: adam if i work there, i feel like i would have to learn words like "edge" and stuff

06:27:34
<transcript>: Go and start the video then.

06:27:40
teej_dv: that doesn't sound fun

06:27:41
<transcript>: It's just an impossible task.

06:27:51
<transcript>: Like, I think there are two people on Earth that could make this not awkward. And that's prime and Tiege, Prime Tiege. On this stage, I would enjoy it.

06:27:51
<transcript>: basically

06:27:54
<transcript>: Basically anybody else. Good luck.

06:27:54
<transcript>: i'm not trying to

06:27:55
uberrick: Yeah it’s all about the edge

06:27:56
theruggedbear: i agree with that

06:27:58
kociqq: true

06:27:59
<transcript>: I'm not trying to be critical of these people. It's just like this setup. This is very difficult.

06:27:59
<transcript>: and like

06:28:03
techxtalks: prime should just do the whole show

06:28:04
teej_dv: haha we have literally done this already (vimconf 2020 & 2021)

06:28:06
tayloreddev: chief Edging Officer

06:28:14
<transcript>: And like Versaille, very good at content production, high production quality. But like, you switch over to Live context. They're just staring at the crowd. There's nothing. Like they have nothing. And it's just harder. Live is hard. All this is hard. Don't hear me being critical. Like, I think I could do better because I could.

06:28:23
maleero: You would have to pay Prime every dollar in existence to get him to speak at Next.js LUL

06:28:34
teej_dv: I think Adam is basically saying: "just don't have this segment" LUL

06:28:34
caldotjs: also I feel like hyping tech crowds isn't the easiest. Since we tend to be a bit awkward at times

06:28:37
theruggedbear: @teej_dv neovim conf too ?

06:28:46
teej_dv: @teej_dv this year yes, nvimconf this year.

06:28:47
<transcript>: Yes. Just don't have the segment. That's exactly what I'm saying.

06:28:47
<transcript>: we didn't need

06:28:51
<transcript>: We didn't need a pre. The preshow was maybe not a great idea.

06:28:56
theruggedbear: @teej_dv let's gooo

06:28:57
teej_dv: Maybe @adamdotdev should do a talk for nvim conf :)

06:29:11
caldotjs: he should

06:29:18
teej_dv: https://www.neovimconf.live/ <3 <3 sign up

texoport: ah sorry rip commas are hard on mobile lol

06:51:34

06:51:44
uberrick: reckon they're going to say blazingly fast at some point?

06:51:49
rambo247: i bet the people in the back are annoyed. she doesnt stop talking and they trying to work

06:52:05
<transcript>: Next font was the greatest thing on that graphic. The biggest thing I'm excited about is Next Slash font.

06:52:08
laytanl_: I still don't like file-based routing that much

06:52:15
trout_soda: yeah he needs to take 2 steps forward on stage

06:52:19
jenswoeste: generating and streaming the UI => $$$ for the cloud backend provider?

06:52:29
laytanl_: a seperate file for loading and error states seems weird too

06:57:02
<transcript>: So it's using.

06:57:04
<transcript>: Optional fonts.

06:57:14
<transcript>: Or it's using swap, but it's doing margins and padding and stuff to make sure there's no layout shift. That's cool, if that's what it's doing.

06:57:22
kociqq: I assume it is doing that yeah

06:57:23
theruggedbear: it was something about invisible text

06:58:25
helocene: @laytanl_ those aren’t real people lol

06:58:35
<transcript>: that we no longer

06:58:39
teej_dv: fast blogs POGSLIDE

06:58:46
<transcript>: That we no longer have to deal with the optional font. I hate optional fonts because you don't get them on first load and that's most people's only exposure to your site so not having to use optional if we can use swap but not have layout shift.

06:58:48
<transcript>: Shifts.

06:58:48

07:25:03
<transcript>: I'm down scaling an OBS, so that's probably the problem.

07:25:06
<transcript>: What would be.

07:25:09
itsboek: since you're only streaming 1080p

07:25:09
teej_dv: ^

07:25:13
itsboek: you can pull 1080p

07:25:15
alystairplays: I'm jealous of your camera

07:25:20
itsboek: and you shouldn't ever overheat

07:25:20
<transcript>: I just don't care about anything they're saying. What would be the best meme for Turbo Pack? I'm so excited and then doesn't support next dynamic and then I am not excited. What's the best meme format for that? Because I have to make that meme.

07:25:26
<transcript>: Yeah? If I dropped it down to 1080p.

07:25:32
uberrick: what is next dynamic?

07:25:34
teej_dv: what words do you want to do @adamdotdev ? say it again

07:25:38
uberrick: just dynamically loading components?

07:25:39
<transcript>: I know I did it one time I used to stream, but all my cameras were just one thousand and eighty P. I don't remember why I went to don't know, because YouTube. I just didn't want to be switching it back and forth.

07:25:39
<transcript>: that's

07:25:41
<transcript>: That's what it was.

07:25:46
<transcript>: Tee. I want it to be.

07:25:46
<transcript>: like

07:25:49
caldotjs: this could work https://imgflip.com/meme/Running-Away-Balloon

07:25:54
<transcript>: Like the idea that I'm so excited for Turbo Pack. I want to play with it, but then I found out it does not support Next slash dynamic.

07:25:54
<transcript>: now i'm not

07:25:56
<transcript>: Now I'm not excited.

07:25:56
<transcript>: i lost

07:25:58
caldotjs: this too https://imgflip.com/meme/Buff-Doge-vs-Cheems

07:25:58
<transcript>: I lost all excitement.

07:25:59
nxception: @adamdotdev Simpsons walking in and out meme

07:26:03
caldotjs: a bit normie but still

07:26:04
<transcript>: Oh, looking at you all you guys are memsters.

07:26:11
thdxr: Adam just stop using nextjs already

07:26:16
<transcript>: Willynilly.

07:26:17
thdxr: turn off the stream

07:26:17
oetziofficial: I saw a meme with a site made only out of loaders

07:26:23
helocene: that picture of prime and rox

07:26:27
alystairplays: Bad Luck Brian could be good

07:26:29
teej_dv: @caldotjs this one probably works

07:26:37
laytanl_: @caldotjs the first one is great for that

07:26:38
murrrrrphy: https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/002/114/997/130.jpg this is the first one that came to mind

07:26:38
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, that's a perfect one. The pulling of me away from it thing.

07:26:54
murrrrrphy: it supports next dynamic, right?

07:27:02
<transcript>: But those.

07:27:15
laytanl_: *watching a nextjs conf*: I don't care what any of them is saying

07:27:17
<transcript>: Yeah, that works.

07:27:23
<transcript>: I'm gonna do the pulling away thing.

07:27:24
powerstoff: @laytanl_ +1

07:27:28
teej_dv: idk the right words though, i thought this one was ironic tho LUL https://i.imgflip.com/6y90lj.jpg

07:27:47
nxception: @adamdotdev This is the perfect one https://giphy.com/gifs/fDO2Nk0ImzvvW

07:28:03
laytanl_: you should add not supporting next/dynamic and not supporting tailwind

07:28:06
powerstoff: @Fredkisss ask live pls xd

07:28:15
theruggedbear: @Fredkisss yes

07:28:15
uberrick: @teej_dv stick to rust ;)

07:28:21
jenswoeste: do they realize that they are being eyeballed by prime? https://twitter.com/t3dotgg/status/1584972214855946240

07:28:24
uberrick: haha joking teej was a good try

07:28:27
fredkisss: I don't know how @PowerStoff

07:28:28
laytanl_: @nxception oeh good one

07:28:49
nxception: :D

07:28:50
<transcript>: Prime Prime.

07:29:37
itsboek: lol what

07:29:38
<transcript>: I'm just so glad that it question they weren't prepared for.

07:29:39
estrangedhd: I heard a lot about the web, at a conf based around a web framework... you don't say

07:29:48
kociqq: LMAO

07:29:48

estrangedhd: @UberRick avoid nosql for life*

07:30:15
<transcript>: Oh, it's focused.

07:30:17
laytanl_: viral tweet there

07:30:27
itsboek: wait

07:30:30
<transcript>: Now late. Nobody knows what I'm talking about, so it's not a viral tweet.

07:30:36
uberrick: Don't do DynamoDB like that @EstrangedHD

07:30:46
estrangedhd: @UberRick Sorry, I like my relations

07:30:46
thdxr: yeah careful...you're in nosql territory here

07:31:06
theruggedbear: adam, a small question: your course about aws is going to be paid right ?

07:31:06
<transcript>: Yet is turns out.

07:31:21
itsboek: 🪦🪦🪦

07:31:27
uberrick: so I've heard servers... and I've heard web... go check my blog

07:31:31
teej_dv: so you can't use tailwind with turbo?

07:31:33
jenswoeste: "top of the list of things we are TRYING to support very soon"

07:31:37
jenswoeste: great answer

07:31:40
lekooldude: these young ppl make me feel damn old

07:31:40
theruggedbear: @teej_dv you cant

07:31:44
teej_dv: i literally don't undersatnd, how can these things not work together LUL is it not just javascript

07:31:44
<transcript>: You can teach you just have to use concurrently.

07:31:46
laytanl_: Prime should ask some generic shit and plug his stream

07:31:47
uberrick: it sounds like it's suboptimal

07:31:48
teej_dv: hahaha i'm such an idiot

07:31:49
<transcript>: You have to write, run it in a sidecar process.

07:31:58
<transcript>: Because it makes me realize how ridiculous all this stuff is.

07:31:58
<transcript>: taylor's

07:32:00
<transcript>: Taylor's great.

07:32:09
thdxr: I wish I knew how to have a career not in webdev

07:32:09
itsboek: this is why I left the web lmao

07:32:09
theruggedbear: im gonna stick to next12

07:32:13
thdxr: probably so much more hcill

07:32:14
laytanl_: Turbopack isn't js though

07:32:19
kociqq: @theruggedbear why?

07:32:22
itsboek: @thdxr mobile :)

07:32:25
teej_dv: like i thought tailwind was just css classes or something. so it doesn't make sense to me that you can't ship css

07:32:25
thdxr: wait I used to be a backend engineer....why did I switch

07:32:27
uberrick: You heard it here first. Tailwind is sub optimal

07:32:35
<transcript>: It's just the Dev part of tailwind.

07:32:35
<transcript>: like

07:32:42
laytanl_: @teej_dv It generates classes

07:32:43
<transcript>: Like as you make changes, you add tailwind classes. It's the tail wind is listening and watching those files and generating your final CSS.

07:32:45
<transcript>: And it's.

07:32:45
<transcript>: like running

07:32:48
<transcript>: Like running turbo pack can't stand alone.

07:32:48
<transcript>: also

07:32:49
laytanl_: based on source

07:32:53
<transcript>: Also handle the tailwind piece so you have to run them concurrently.

07:32:53
<transcript>: like separately

07:32:54
<transcript>: Like separately.

07:32:57
teej_dv: ah, gotcha

07:33:00
thdxr: modern webdev = running 6 different watchers

07:33:11
teej_dv: so tailwind generates only the classes you need based on what you use or somethin like that?

07:33:14
<transcript>: Yes.

07:33:17
<transcript>: That's right.

07:33:17
helocene: correct

07:33:17
theruggedbear: @teej_dv yep

07:33:17
laytanl_: Exactly

07:33:23
teej_dv: ty, thank you web geniuses

07:33:32
teej_dv: for stooping down and explaining to this humble terminal developer

07:33:41
theruggedbear: @teej_dv we love you teej

07:33:51
uberrick: Hey it's ThePrimeagen from Nextflix

07:33:57
laytanl_: There is tailwind for the terminal https://github.com/nunomaduro/termwind

07:34:11
maleero: Is the stream too quiet for anyone else? I keep having to adjust my volume when he talks over it LUL

07:34:21
<transcript>: I don't know what's their timer right now. I didn't hear the question.

07:34:25
<transcript>: Oh, sorry, mealy, Ro.

07:34:25
<transcript>: i think it's all

07:34:26
<transcript>: I think it's all the way up.

07:34:29
helocene: this is a long q&a

07:35:06
laytanl_: @texoport LOL

07:35:43
teej_dv: @teej_dv <3

07:35:47
teej_dv: @UberRick im hoping

07:35:56
powerstoff: @texoport ok back to angular 1 haha

07:36:01
itsboek: wait lol termwind wants you to write your terminal application as html?

07:36:18
<transcript>: Kitsy's Tweet was fantastic.

07:36:26
<transcript>: I really start listening to the questions.

07:36:50
teej_dv: LOL "build in common footguns"

07:36:51
teej_dv: ahahahahaha

07:36:51
laytanl_: @itsboek yeah and it parses that into cli based colors and padding etc

07:37:15
texoport: @itsboek damn, bubbletea needs tailwind

07:37:20
oetziofficial: alt tag is required me: `<Image alt="" />`

07:37:30
danielgerep: I don't understand a thing these people are talking about hahaha

07:37:43
powerstoff: @OetziOfficial same StinkyGlitch

07:38:05
nexxeln: this qna is too long

07:38:05
texoport: "that's a good question" "yeah, i thought so when I wrote it"

07:38:07
thdxr: the fact that you can have a whole conference for a frontend framework is a bad thing

07:38:17
<transcript>: Agreed. Dax 100%.

07:38:26
<transcript>: This panel would have been 1 million times better had they put the kids super guys up there on stage with them. Let them feel questions too if they feel like it.

07:38:26
<transcript>: that'd been good

07:38:27
laytanl_: If the image does not add anything informational, an empty alt tag is actually the recommended

07:38:28
<transcript>: That'd been good.

07:38:44
teej_dv: and every question could either be a React style question or a Fashion style question

07:38:46
teej_dv: LUL

07:38:50
thdxr: does anyone actually use codemods

07:38:51
nxception: Finally!! No more <a> tag within the <Link>

07:38:52
helocene: huh I didn’t realize use() will replace getserversideprops etc

07:38:54
thdxr: I just quit my job and start over

07:39:02
theruggedbear: and there is Theo: "Next.js is a backend framework"

07:39:03
oetziofficial: @thdxr i used it in blitzjs

07:39:22
oetziofficial: but i am not using blitzjs anymore

07:39:26
<transcript>: Next is a back end framework for frontends. That's what it is. And that's not. I'm not speaking down on frontend. Devs. I've said it before I'll say it again.

07:39:30
<transcript>: Frontend tartar. I think it's harder than back end.

07:39:35
uberrick: BFF

07:39:42
danielgerep: Harder because it is a mess!

07:39:42
<transcript>: Hang on.

07:39:43
teej_dv: front end is harder because front end devs are in charge of it LUL

07:39:44
theruggedbear: eyyy, the bowl master !

07:39:48
<transcript>: I'll this has made this talk way better. Look at this.

07:39:53
<transcript>: Q Amp a just got interesting Binja, thanks so much for the raid.

07:39:56
itsboek: easy/hard is relative. The one you don't know is harder 😂

07:39:56
<transcript>: Bowl master.

07:40:01
<transcript>: Charger.

07:40:05
akawr: hey akawrLove

07:40:08
<transcript>: That's the thing. Boom. Okay, we don't care about this, right.

07:40:10
itsboek: @teej_dv lmao

07:40:13
<transcript>: I'm gonna turn this down.

07:40:13
<transcript>: that's

07:40:22
<transcript>: That's the thing. I've used all of them the same amount. I feel like I'm an objective. Like I've built frontend. I've built backend. I've built whatever.

07:40:22
<transcript>: i'm bad

07:40:25
thdxr: frontend is hard in a way that no one can get good at

07:40:25
<transcript>: I'm bad at all of them, but I've done all of them.

07:40:25
<transcript>: and i feel like

07:40:30
thdxr: you can get good at backend

07:40:33
uberrick: BE seems like less moving parts

07:40:40
<transcript>: And I feel like eight years in ten years into my frontend web, like journey. My experience with Frontend Dev. It's a pretty long time. I've been doing it. I still think it's harder. I think it's maybe it is. Maybe it's just harder because we've made it harder.

07:40:40
<transcript>: but i think

07:40:42
powerstoff: pls fix in js 1+'1' than we can work haha

07:40:43
<transcript>: But I think there's a lot more things you have to think about.

07:40:43
<transcript>: like

07:40:46
<transcript>: Like when it touches the user right user experience.

07:40:46
<transcript>: access

07:40:48
<transcript>: Accessibility.

07:40:48
<transcript>: st

07:40:52
poweys: Agree

07:40:59
<transcript>: Styling all these things. And then there's the state management, which is just a giant nightmare, which I think that's more our fault than inherently state management. That hard.

07:41:04
laytanl_: I spent 5 hours setting up eslint and typescript in every front-end project I start

07:41:09
xcodex77: @PowerStoff I can't agree more Lol

07:41:16
<transcript>: Yeah. I just think front end up. I think we should stop funneling new devs into frontend Dev. We should send them to teach, let them learn some terminal stuff where they can play with APIs within an app that they don't have to think about any of that other stuff. Then I'm thinking about their front end or where they're funding is hosted. They just build a little CLI thing.

07:41:19
danielgerep: It's on you now @teej_dv ahaha

07:41:21
teej_dv: truuuueeee just print to cli

07:41:25
teej_dv: that's my advice to everyone learning

07:41:33
<transcript>: I sounds way better to me. I just think we'd have fewer people start down the track, get overwhelmed and react and with hooks and then bail. I think they'd be more likely to stick and be excited about programming if they actually did programming.

07:41:35
<transcript>: I don't know. Okay, I'm done.

07:41:37
teej_dv: "re-invent `ls` for yourself"

07:41:38
n0rdengg: @teej_dv make me your padawan

07:41:39
laytanl_: Thats why most colleges start with python

07:41:45
uberrick: we've advanced to much. I just want to buy something from Amazon in my CLI

07:41:52
<transcript>: Yeah. It's hard. In a way. Knowing good at that. So good. Dax. It's exactly right.

07:41:53
laytanl_: just bootcamps and self tought is always js

07:42:14
poweys: Is there anything after this?

07:42:15
teej_dv: @n0rdenGG ok, step 1 read vim help docs then come back to me

07:42:22
thdxr: I can't believe we're talking this long about a LINK COMPONENT

07:42:32
teej_dv: @Poweys you'd think no, because this is normally how you end the day. but they have all their prepared talks still LUL

07:42:33
danielgerep: @thdxr It changes so fast that when you get good, you are outdated.

07:42:34
<transcript>: Prime.

07:42:37
<transcript>: Oh.

07:42:40
helocene: and no new framework to learn every 2 months

07:42:42
<transcript>: Didn't know that.

07:43:04
estrangedhd: Vercel is buying everthing and everybody, I swear to god, soon they own frontend development

07:43:06
<transcript>: Answer.

07:43:22
teej_dv: i should just create next.rs and use exactly all the same words but with rust + wasm

07:43:25
theruggedbear: favang incoming ?

07:43:26
<transcript>: Go away.

07:43:37
<transcript>: Yes. Teej, please.

07:43:40
itsboek: @thdxr This mindset is part of the problem. Just because there are new shiny things doesn't mean your skills are outdated. Your user absolutely does not care if you're using React or Backbone

07:43:52
theruggedbear: LOL

07:44:06
theruggedbear: no API routes ?

07:44:06
nexxeln: @teej_dv DO IT

07:44:18
<transcript>: Yeah, Rick, it Bear. I don't know that. I.

07:44:18
<transcript>: don't

07:44:22
nxception: q/a is almost done

07:44:22
<transcript>: Don't disagree with no API routes in the app folder.

07:44:26
oetziofficial: aaaand app-route is out of question for me

07:44:26
<transcript>: This is kind of weird.

07:44:29
<transcript>: It's kind of weird with server components.

07:44:41
laytanl_: One thing right, we are now going to get talks from people that did not know what was being announced when making their talk

07:44:42
thdxr: CAM DEAD

07:44:42
itsboek: rip camera

07:44:43
<transcript>: I just never liked API routes, so I build APIs outside of my Next apps I use Next for the front end, so I don't have to think about webpack.

07:44:45
estrangedhd: There goes the cam again

07:44:46
<transcript>: Cam dead.

07:44:47
laytanl_: So it is all outdated

07:44:50
<transcript>: Tej I mean Prime Prime Prime Prime.

07:44:54
powerstoff: me meem eee

07:45:03
uberrick: It's Prime from The Startup

07:45:05
<transcript>: He was pointing at Primed. That's where prime is standing. On that side. We saw it. Trash. Trash out of Footo.

07:45:15
nxception: Do you have a good guide on using a different backend with NextJS? I wanted to try out Golang + NextJS

07:45:29
nate_codes: AYYY WATCH PARTY LETS GO

07:45:31
uberrick: lol the blank faces

07:45:33
nate_codes: I was wondering who'd be streaming today

07:45:39
nexxeln: just use nextjs like you use react @nxception

07:45:46
thdxr: Using nextjs with a different backend is a GREAT combo

07:45:46
nexxeln: don't think about api routes

07:45:49
uberrick: this is a deflect answer

07:46:12
oetziofficial: why does the conference give me the feeling of "its an announcement for an announcement, SoonTM"

07:46:23
laytanl_: @thdxr Thats what we do, next is our frontend

07:46:23
uberrick: if someone says profiling just give some politics answer

07:46:38
thdxr: omg finally it's over

07:46:46
uberrick: SWAG

07:46:50
teej_dv: SWAG DROP

07:46:51
<transcript>: Oh, it's over.

07:46:51
<transcript>: end it please

07:46:52
<transcript>: End it. Please.

07:46:54

07:47:50
<transcript>: What is this? We're looking at this kid, Super.

07:47:53
<transcript>: Kid, Super.

07:47:57
teej_dv: WAIT you're going to leave?

07:48:01
<transcript>: Isn't next shape JS way over engineered for most front ends. I think it's like just flexible.

07:48:01
<transcript>: i if

07:48:05
<transcript>: I if you're using reaction react, I would say just use an XJS instead.

07:48:05
<transcript>: don't use

07:48:06
uberrick: it's just like silicon valley episode

07:48:07
<transcript>: Don't use like.

07:48:07
<transcript>: create react

07:48:09
uberrick: over to kid rock

<transcript>: Crate React App Use Next JS. It's more flexible. A lot of other niceties.

07:48:19
<transcript>: but if

07:48:21
<transcript>: But if you're not using React, obviously.

07:48:21
<transcript>: i don't know

07:48:22
helocene: Tanner’s tweet gonna give Guillermo ideas

07:48:25
<transcript>: I don't know that next yes is enough to pull you into the react ecosystem.

07:48:29
<transcript>: If you're not using react good on you.

07:48:32
<transcript>: So Tehas is the first.

<transcript>: Did I say his name right. There's so many names I've only ever read.

07:48:37

07:50:55
powerstoff: xdddd

07:51:05

07:52:57
thdxr: apple.com is served by a mac mini in tim cook's basement

07:53:03
<transcript>: Wow.

07:53:13
tomofromearth___: @teej_dv tomofrKappa

07:53:14

07:53:34
laytanl_: https://builtwith.com/apple.com

07:53:37
<transcript>: If Apple had to pay for it. No, it's so true. Does not scale well at those scales, right? Pricing wise.

07:53:38
uberrick: this conf so far has been dumbed down so much. Crazy marketing buzz words but no tech talk

07:53:40
<transcript>: Okay.

07:53:40
<transcript>: i just got

07:53:43

07:54:01
<transcript>: this is

07:54:02

07:54:06
<transcript>: This is my thoughts. My sinister Malki. Okay. Yeah, we'll raid Milky.

07:54:08
nate_codes: @teej_dv ^^

07:54:21
tomofromearth___: Yo thanks dude.  Haha.

07:54:26
<transcript>: Real quick. Oh, thanks so much, Nate. Thanks for the gifts, hub. Tatomo. So just real quick. These are thoughts I'm not gonna put in my YouTube videos, so I'm gonna make a YouTube video that's, like, recapping next Conf. But these are thoughts that I they're juicier. I won't put them on YouTube, probably. But like my overwhelming feeling from this whole conference.

07:54:26
<transcript>: is

07:54:26
nate_codes: SPICY TAKES PogChamp

07:54:30
<transcript>: Is one. I hope it doesn't age terribly.

07:54:30
<transcript>: in like five years

07:54:31
<transcript>: In like five years.

07:54:31
<transcript>: when

07:54:32
<transcript>: When.

07:54:40
nate_codes: 😅

07:54:44
<transcript>: All the venture Gaps has dried up, and I mean, I know, like they've raised $350,000,000, like Versaille. I'm sure has a more chest and a runway longer than I can imagine.

07:54:44
<transcript>: but

07:54:45
<transcript>: But.

07:54:45
<transcript>: these

07:54:49
<transcript>: These conferences in the entire death.

07:54:49
<transcript>: profession

07:54:50
<transcript>: Profession.

07:54:51
itsboek: You would hope

07:54:54
<transcript>: Tire me so much.

07:54:55
thdxr: yesss

07:54:56
thdxr: go inn

07:54:59
nate_codes: Clearly they have a warchest, check out those WWDC slides. YOu know how costly it is to license graphic design assets from Apple?

07:55:01
thdxr: this is what I want to hear

07:55:02
<transcript>: I just the whole thing. I mean, it's one thing like the cringe. It's one thing like we all hate watching.

07:55:02
<transcript>: the like

07:55:04
theruggedbear: WE ARE DEVELOPERS WE NEED FACTS

07:55:08
<transcript>: The like, early segments, where they're just all so uncomfortable. And it's just it's painful to watch.

07:55:08
<transcript>: but

07:55:18
fitzsimons_dev: ohhhhh going hard

07:55:22
<transcript>: But also just like how many people are employed in Devrel and how much just seeing all these people, I know who they are. I've heard of their technologies, not stuff I use, but I've heard of it because they're all over Twitter. And I swear to all these conferences.

07:55:22
<transcript>: are all the

07:55:40
nate_codes: disagree

07:55:42
<transcript>: Are all the Devrels showing up together. And I get it like other people go. But it's just this one big, like Devrel party. And I feel like that's what's taken over most of, like all the public facing Dev stuff. It's what I love about Twitch. I love that their actual developers getting on Twitch and building stuff. And you can come watch and hang out because I feel like this whole glossy world of Devrell.

07:55:47
<transcript>: Is too much for me, Nate disagrees.

07:55:49
teej_dv: imagine being an actual dev LUL

07:55:53
<transcript>: Tell me, Nate. Tell me about it. What do you disagree with? Do you think Devrel's? Amazing. It's actually doing stuff.

07:55:53
<transcript>: it's helping

07:55:53
nate_codes: Next.js conf has the lowest devrel speaker participation IMO

07:55:54
<transcript>: It's helping the industry.

07:55:54
<transcript>: maybe i'm just

07:55:58
nate_codes: more framework creators

07:56:00
nate_codes: way more

07:56:02
<transcript>: Maybe I'm just, like, annoyed. Maybe it's not that it's a net negative. Maybe it does help people. I just. I feel like all this.

07:56:06
nate_codes: Q4 is conf season

07:56:09
thdxr: people are paid to have developer relations with you

07:56:09
nate_codes: It's always gonna be like this

07:56:14
<transcript>: Look, I have FOMO right now, like hard FOMO over this conference, because like every body went to San Francisco for this, so like, got a factor that in but also.

07:56:14
<transcript>: just

07:56:21
thisisitbruv: with me 😊

07:56:23
nate_codes: GitHub universe for example is WAY more 🥑 heavy

07:56:34
<transcript>: Just the number of photos of these people all hanging out and just bouncing around all the different conferences. I don't know. I think it's gonna age terribly when like, money isn't free because money isn't free anymore. It just hasn't caught up to tech yet. I mean, like not talking public markets. Like public market. Sure. Like stock prices, whatever. But in the terms of, like the venture capital.

07:56:34
<transcript>: the froth

07:56:35
theruggedbear: @nate_codes i don't think Adam is speaking about the conf itself. he mentioned twitter etc...

07:56:37
<transcript>: The frothy environment we've been in for a decade.

07:56:37
<transcript>: that part

07:56:41
kedemel: Tech Bubble 2.0

07:56:43
<transcript>: That part we haven't hit yet with Tech, and I think five years from now, stuff like this is gonna look really bad.

07:56:43
<transcript>: that's just

07:56:50
nate_codes: We've got representation / participation from: React, Svelte, Solid, and (I think) Remix

07:56:52
<transcript>: That's just my like my guess that sometime in the next five years, we're gonna look back on this period where SWIX is at every conference, hanging out with.

07:56:52
<transcript>: pages

07:56:58
<transcript>: Pages. And they're all like, slapping backs. I just think it's gonna age, terribly.

07:56:58
<transcript>: i'm not

07:57:08
<transcript>: I'm not trying to be like negative or alarmist. I just. It bothers me. I don't know. Something about it bothers me. And like the amount of money put into the production side of it. This is not like an anti.

07:57:08
<transcript>: money

07:57:10
danielgerep: I love the minioned!! haha

07:57:17
<transcript>: Money or anti capitalist take. This is just like Devrel. I think Devil's kind of dumb. I'm sorry. I just think it's all kind of dumb.

07:57:17
<transcript>: i said

07:57:18
itsboek: @nate_codes 1/3 is devrel at this conf.

07:57:20
liquidor: I agree with Adam.

07:57:21
nate_codes: Again, I don't disagree w/ your main point of devrel invasion in confs, but this conf is the smallest offender IMO

07:57:21
<transcript>: I said it. That was my spicy takes of the day.

07:57:24
poweys: Agree

07:57:27
<transcript>: One third is Devrell at this conference. I mean, I'd say more than a third, and I'd say.

07:57:27
<transcript>: the amount

07:57:28
tomofromearth___: What is devrel

07:57:30
<transcript>: The amount of influence that Devrell has.

07:57:30
<transcript>: does it have if

07:57:33
<transcript>: Does it have if I don't even know what is devil Tomo.

07:57:33
<transcript>: it's

07:57:35
tomofromearth___: Hi noob here.  Lol

07:57:35
itsboek: (just with devrel in their title)

07:57:36
theruggedbear: @TomoFromEarth___ developer relationship w/e

07:57:38
<transcript>: It's people who are hired to promote technologies to developers.

07:57:41
<transcript>: So Developer relations.

07:57:41
<transcript>: i

07:57:46
<transcript>: I have a lot of friends that are Devrells. I mean, DAX, you're kind of a Deborah, right.

07:57:47
tomofromearth___: Ahhh.  Ok.

07:57:48
nate_codes: It's the corporate endorsement/shilling that bothers me much more...but that's not devrel that's conf marketing 101

07:57:51
thdxr: shit I AM?

07:58:00
uberrick: oh wow @thdxr you gonna take that?

07:58:03
<transcript>: I mean, you're. No, you're actually a devs. I have real friends, like, especially at AWS, they're Deborah's, and I get it like, AWS, it's a huge, giant thing. No, you're not DAX, but when you're at a three person startup like you're always doing all things. So you're kind of doing debris while you're also building the thing.

07:58:05
tomofromearth___: We call that a pitch person.

07:58:07
tomofromearth___: Lol

07:58:09
<transcript>: You're not a Dev rail back. You build amazing things.

07:58:09
<transcript>: a pitch person yeah

07:58:10
nate_codes: Vercel devrels in general are also WAY more eng heavy than other companies

07:58:11
<transcript>: A pitch person. Yeah. So.

07:58:11
<transcript>: if you're aws

07:58:12
<transcript>: If you're AWS.

07:58:12
<transcript>: you make

07:58:27
fitzsimons_dev: Dax is Fractional CTO Rel

07:58:33
<transcript>: You make 300 plus services. You need to explain that to a whole lot of people and the people who are going out and making blog posts, and they're creating video content and audio content. And they're like teaching people how to use all these things. I'm not trying to like downplay the significance of that and how important it is. And I have a ton of friends that would identify into this Devrell umbrella. And I'm not saying.

07:58:33
<transcript>: that's bad

07:58:37
<transcript>: That's bad. I'm saying this whole conference scene and.

07:58:37
<transcript>: i don't know

07:58:37
thdxr: I like that

07:58:38
<transcript>: I don't know.

07:58:40
thdxr: fraction me up

07:58:40
itsboek: The difference is AWS makes an absolute shit ton of money. Spending money on Marketing makes sense for them

07:58:41
<transcript>: I just rather have the minion eyes on that's awesome.

07:58:44
nate_codes: You can tell a lot about a company by looking at their devrels + their backgrounds

07:58:52
<transcript>: I don't like I don't travel much. So it's easy for me to be kind of biased against this whole conference scene. I just think it's kind of disgusting.

07:58:53
tomofromearth___: The whole time hahahahaha.

07:58:56
<transcript>: Oh, Debrael. Scene. Okay, I'm done.

07:58:59
<transcript>: It's been so fun.

07:59:03
nate_codes: @itsboek yeah the marketing spend vs dev payoff is def a topic to be discussed...

07:59:11
laytanl_: Cancelled!

07:59:16
<transcript>: Please don't clip that last bit and share it all over it's. Not that I'm ashamed of it. It's just I don't want to hurt people's feelings. Like, I'm not gonna put that in a Twitter in a YouTube video because ultimately, I think there are people doing really good work, and I'm not trying to download the entire role as like a waste of time canceled. I'm just saying.

07:59:18
helocene: I do enjoy how Lee approaches devrel

07:59:22
<transcript>: I have a hard time watching this and not just constantly thinking about.

07:59:22
<transcript>: those facts

07:59:23
nate_codes: ^^

07:59:25
ghostyx101: i aagree with u

07:59:29
<transcript>: Those facts that I just laid out, not anything facts, just that's the only thing I can really think about is how much.

07:59:29
theruggedbear: devrel is something like: i'm about to speak 5 minutes but i would not say anything in that 5 minutes (most of the devrel)

07:59:32
<transcript>: It bothers me.

07:59:32
<transcript>: and

07:59:32
thdxr: the root problem is devrel is boring

07:59:35
liquidor: #DevBreak

07:59:36
<transcript>: And I can't even put my I need to articulate it better. I need to come up with the words.

07:59:38
thdxr: if it wasn't boring I wouldn't care

07:59:38
nate_codes: If you watch any other confs this season you're gonna die of cringe...

07:59:44
nate_codes: this isn't even bad IMHO

07:59:50
<transcript>: Debris. Something like I'm about to speak five minutes, but I would not say anything in that five minutes. Most of the debris root problem is Devrel is boring. Maybe that is maybe I'm just annoyed because it feels like a waste of time. It feels like.

07:59:57
<transcript>: A whole lot of like I mean, half of that conference.

07:59:57
<transcript>: that

08:00:00
<transcript>: That could have been it could have been an email, right? That could have been like.

08:00:00
<transcript>: a

08:00:00
ghostyx101: it is

08:00:01
oetziofficial: I dont think its waste of time

08:00:03
<transcript>: A onepager. They've released the thing.

08:00:03
<transcript>: it's good

08:00:04
<transcript>: It's good.

08:00:04
<transcript>: it's not

08:00:07
laytanl_: Oh no, Prime was going to ask a question but they ended it

08:00:09
<transcript>: It's not a waste of time. I'm not. I guess I'm not trying to say it's a waste of time. I just think.

08:00:09
<transcript>: it's over

08:00:12
nate_codes: The root problem of devrel is the perception of it as a good "break into tech" role (both by the hiring population and the interviewing population)

08:00:13
<transcript>: It's over. It's gone too far. The individual.

08:00:13
tomofromearth___: I mean tech has so much money why don’t they just hire the same people Hollywood does to do that job lol.  Some people are just good at BS lol.

08:00:19
<transcript>: Has gone too far. That's what I'm trying to say. Okay? I can't keep up with everybody's.

08:00:19
daneoshiga: come meet the python community, events are community driven and talks are crowdsourced

08:00:22
<transcript>: I'm trying to read.

08:00:26
<transcript>: If you watch any other conferences season, you're gonna die of cringe.

08:00:26
<transcript>: you know

08:00:27
oetziofficial: it helps me to understand the gist of the tech but also its romantizing tech, so hmmm

08:00:33
<transcript>: You know, it's the cringe. Just one thing. It's always gonna be cringe because there's no way you're gonna, like, get people up there. And it not be.

08:00:37
<transcript>: Prime's gonna ask a question, but they end it. Was he really.

08:00:37
<transcript>: oh man

08:00:46
nate_codes: @laytanl_ FeelsBadMan

08:00:47
poweys: Unfortunately devrel is too heavy on marketing and they rarely build real world solutions using the tools they advocate.

08:00:47
<transcript>: Oh, man. Well, he was looking. Levrob was looking over in his direction. I know he was standing on that side of the room because trash sent pictures on Twitter.

08:00:47
<transcript>: root prom

08:01:07
<transcript>: Root promo. Devrell is a perception of it. Is this good break into Tech role both by the hiring population interviewing population. Oh, that's interesting. I wasn't even thinking in terms of, like, new devs getting kind of put into Devrell. I just. There's not Devrell. I shouldn't say Deborah bothers me. That's not it. It's something about the intersection of DeBrill and the travel conference.

08:01:07
<transcript>: scene

08:01:15
<transcript>: Scene and the submitting for talks. There's just something about it all that feels like it's off. I don't know.

08:01:15
<transcript>: tell me i mean

08:01:16
nate_codes: That's why so many devrels are bad / lack substance....they have only been technical for 1-3 yrs

08:01:20
<transcript>: Tell me I mean, Tech has so much money. Why don't they just hire the same people Hollywood does to do that job.

08:01:20
<transcript>: yeah

08:01:36
<transcript>: Yeah. No. That's a good point. Like if you're gonna do it, if you're gonna have that opening segment, that preshow thing, at least hire people who know how to be on camera. I feel like I'm sliding individuals. I'm not trying to I just don't think like, there are people who were devs. They became devrels. And now we all have to all watch.

08:01:36
<transcript>: this terribly

08:01:40
<transcript>: This terribly awkward train wreck. That is a preshow.

08:01:40
<transcript>: and what

08:01:45
<transcript>: And what does it hurt us? I don't know. 30 minutes of our time. Not a big deal, but.

08:01:46
nate_codes: @TomoFromEarth___ Good devrels have been devs for 5+ year and make some of the best educational content out there

08:01:50
<transcript>: I'm gonna stop now. This has been fun.

08:01:50
<transcript>: i'll go back

08:01:54
tomofromearth___: That’s what I’m saying.  I’m certain that there’s people who are charismatic and can wrap their heads around a tech script.

08:01:56
<transcript>: I'll go back and read the transcript later and see what all you said because I missed so much of it as I was just screaming and void.

08:01:59
<transcript>: Okay, it's been fun.

08:01:59
<transcript>: i can't

08:02:01
<transcript>: I can't stop reading.

08:02:05
<transcript>: But I'm gonna go now maybe we could do it again sometime.

08:02:11
