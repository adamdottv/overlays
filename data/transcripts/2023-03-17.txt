00:12:18
<transcript>: that was

00:12:21
<transcript>: That was prerecorded. But during the stream.

00:12:21
<transcript>: they're

00:12:28
devagrawal09: man you stream way too early for me to watch

00:12:30
<transcript>: They're live first time chat. Welcome to Chat Journey in AI Do I have, like, a radio voice? All set? I think it's just like I'm still waking up, like my voice is still kind of like.

00:12:41
devagrawal09: the two days i have been able to tune in is when I pull an all nighter

00:12:43
<transcript>: Okay. Matt coles, welcome to Chat. I need those likes for my lego buildings. Yeah, I got those lights from.

00:12:52
<transcript>: Light my bricks. They make really great, like diy kits. And then they make kits for entire sets. So you can buy like a kit for each modular building.

00:12:54
7ohnnie: The video quality is so good its almost uncanny valley like

00:13:12
<transcript>: But I bought just a bunch of DIY parts, and I went kind of crazy. I drilled holes through the walls so you can't see any of the wires, because, like, the module buildings are so cool, because you can, like, take them apart and you can see down in them in all the detail and all that. And I just didn't want the wires hanging in there. It's like cluttering up the view. So I.

00:13:15
<transcript>: Painstakingly.

00:13:25
<transcript>: Routed wires through walls, and it was a mess, but it worked out. It's pretty great. What is this? Hyperparcore. Okay, I've never seen that one.

00:13:25
<transcript>: what

00:13:29
<transcript>: What are those about? Welcome to Chat. Journey.

00:13:37
<transcript>: The two days I've been able to tune in is when I pull an allnighter she's Dev.

00:13:37
<transcript>: oh man

00:13:40
<transcript>: Oh, man, I haven't done an all either since.

00:13:46
<transcript>: Probably like ten years ago. Probably somewhere in my mid 20s. So.

00:13:46
<transcript>: that's all you got to look

00:13:51
<transcript>: That's all you got to look forward to as you get older. You don't step on that anymore. That's one benefit.

00:13:55
<transcript>: The video quality is so good, it's almost uncanny that.

00:13:58
<transcript>: Kidney Valley. That's where things look, really.

00:13:58
<transcript>: just like not

00:14:00
<transcript>: Just like not quite real.

00:14:00
<transcript>: almost

00:14:02
<transcript>: Almost real. I am real.

00:14:02
<transcript>: this is really me

00:14:07
<transcript>: Do you ever like start streaming.

00:14:07
<transcript>: in the

00:14:10
doublesplinter: @vimcerf  thought it was pre-recorded cuz of the tiny zoom-in; this guy is going places acornThink

00:14:13
devagrawal09: i am thinking of starting streaming

00:14:14
7ohnnie: AI Adam

00:14:18
<transcript>: In the software in dev category. Spend a few months there. And then one morning you wake up and you're like, I wonder if I'll forget or if I'll just, like, write out of things to say, not forget, just like, do you ever do that.

00:14:18
<transcript>: you've been

00:14:24
<transcript>: You've been streaming for a few months, and then you're like, what if I'll just run out of stuff one day.

00:14:24
<transcript>: i just won't have anything

00:14:25
<transcript>: I just won't have anything to say.

00:14:28
<transcript>: Because that's me this morning.

00:14:28
<transcript>: i'm like

00:14:35
<transcript>: I'm like, what do I even do on stream? I mean, I don't get anything done, but how do I come up with stuff to talk about for that long.

00:14:35
<transcript>: like four hours

00:14:36
<transcript>: Like 4 hours every day.

00:14:42
<transcript>: Honest question. Should I just start streaming under just chatting.

00:14:42
<transcript>: because i feel

00:14:47
<transcript>: Because I feel like I'm not really doing a lot of software dev. We do some I try.

00:14:47
<transcript>: i'm just so distracted

00:14:50
7ohnnie: How has Astro been in comparison to Next?

00:14:51
<transcript>: I'm just so distracted, and I'm having so much fun being with you all.

00:14:51
<transcript>: that

00:14:55
<transcript>: That sometimes I want to just a jet just chatting stream.

fragaverage: Because chat :D

00:15:01
journey_in_ai: if you chatting than yes

00:15:02
<transcript>: Thought it was prerecorded because of the tiny Zoom in.

00:15:02
<transcript>: this guy's going

00:15:03
<transcript>: This guy's going places.

00:15:08
<transcript>: I am thinking of starting yeah, the Zoom.

00:15:11
<transcript>: The Zoom is supposed to be.

00:15:11
<transcript>: whenever

00:15:14
<transcript>: Whenever I make big expressions like this.

00:15:14
<transcript>: i

00:15:16
<transcript>: I.

00:15:16
<transcript>: made like a little

00:15:21
<transcript>: Made like a little facial detection thing, and it zooms in on me when there's exciting moments.

00:15:21
<transcript>: unfortunately

00:15:25
journey_in_ai: neat

fragaverage: Adams a secret hot tub streamer

00:15:27
<transcript>: Unfortunately, it's very sensitive. And so it'll trigger on lots of other things. Like I turn my head too far.

00:15:30
<transcript>: Did it do it.

00:15:30
<transcript>: did it

00:15:32
<transcript>: Did it? Is it Zoom.

00:15:32
<transcript>: no

00:15:37
devagrawal09: nop

00:15:37
nft_scam: nah

00:15:38
<transcript>: No. Okay. If I put the cup in front of my face, that'll do it if I cover my eyes sometimes.

00:15:46
<transcript>: Come on. Zoom on me. I said it would. And then it's not going to. Is it okay? Whatever. Now it's decided to be good.

00:15:47
overra_dev: @adamdotdev tldr how it works?

00:15:52
<transcript>: How had Astro bin in comparison to next so zani.

00:15:53
devagrawal09: LUL performance anxiety

00:15:55
<transcript>: Seven zani.

00:15:55
<transcript>: how do i

00:15:55
fragaverage: SCAMMED

00:15:57
fragaverage: LUL

00:15:57
<transcript>: How do I pronounce your name? We're just gonna go Johnny.

00:16:07
<transcript>: It has been great. Also dev, you should start streaming and you should join the Watch dev server. Sorry, I just saw that message.

00:16:07
<transcript>: you should definitely

00:16:08
7ohnnie: Johnnie it is 😂

00:16:13
<transcript>: You should definitely start streaming. You should definitely join the Watchdot dev server, and that would be awesome.

00:16:13
<transcript>: so

00:16:21
<transcript>: So how is Astro Bin? I've actually loved it. I do have the perfect use case. I think Samus.com is like the perfect use case for Astro.

00:16:21
<transcript>: thanks so much

00:16:23
<transcript>: Thanks so much. I follow Johnny.

00:16:23
<transcript>: so i think

00:16:25
devagrawal09: i am in the watch dot dev server already

00:16:39
<transcript>: So I think when you have a perfect use case and a perfect fit with technology, it kind of like colors your perception of that technology. So, like, right now, astro can do no wrong. I love it so much. It's the perfect technology. But like, if I were building something that had a bunch of client interactive, then I would be like, this sucked.

00:16:39
<transcript>: but

00:16:42
<transcript>: But I love it. So next is like, obviously.

00:16:42
<transcript>: better if

00:16:55
<transcript>: Better if you're building something with a lot of something spa like with a lot of clientside interactivity. But that shows great. If you're just like you got a bunch of data and you want to render millions of pages based on that data.

00:16:55
<transcript>: it's been great

00:16:56
<transcript>: It's been great.

00:17:06
<transcript>: And I love just the default zero JS like we have so little interactivity on statmes that I love starting with zero and be able to opt into all the interactivity I want.

00:17:06
<transcript>: four

00:17:11
<transcript>: 4 hours of lara Bars. That's right, Matt Man. Welcome, Matt man.

00:17:15
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:17:15
<transcript>: you

00:17:23
<transcript>: You should try just sharing category pool new viewers. Oh would it actually change the viewership like different people would see me because I'm in just chatting.

00:17:23
<transcript>: you guys

00:17:25
<transcript>: You guys would still see me, though, right.

00:17:25
<transcript>: you still

00:17:29
<transcript>: You still see me regardless of the category, right.

00:17:34

00:18:10
<transcript>: Not a hot tub, but sauna.

00:18:10
<transcript>: i'm very excited

00:18:15
<transcript>: I'm very excited to have sauna we've been waiting six months because the song we want.

00:18:15
<transcript>: apparently

00:18:16
<transcript>: Apparently very popular.

00:18:16
<transcript>: and they don't make

00:18:20
<transcript>: And they don't make a lot of them. So I'm getting a sign in the next couple months.

00:18:20
<transcript>: i think it's

00:18:22
overra_dev: @adamdotdev I think if we're discussing software dev topics, it should count here

00:18:23
<transcript>: I think it's supposed to come in April, actually.

00:18:27
<transcript>: I don't know where that came from. Oh, yeah? Hot tub, shamer.

00:18:36
<transcript>: What was an open nah? Dev and mft. Scam both agree something.

00:18:36
<transcript>: should not

00:18:37
<transcript>: Should not be done.

00:18:42
<transcript>: Overa tldr how it works.

00:18:42
<transcript>: behind

00:18:45
<transcript>: Behind and now I don't know. I don't know what we're all talking about.

00:18:45
<transcript>: oh

00:18:51
<transcript>: Oh, performance anxiety. Are you guys talking about the when I was like, do you ever.

00:18:57
<transcript>: Do you ever just think you're gonna run out things to say? And you guys said nope. Nah. Cool. Okay. I'm alone. Got it.

00:19:09
<transcript>: Scanned. I got to get caught up. Johnny. It is okay, great. I'm in the watcher already. I mean, like be a streamer in the watch. Dev server.

00:19:14
mattmancodes: the tldr was about the camera zoom, I think

00:19:15
<transcript>: That's awesome. Like you can graduate to the ranks of streamer.

00:19:20
devagrawal09: yeah^

00:19:23
<transcript>: Okay, I'm writing proposal prompt for gpt Four to help me convince my company that it could potentially been a benefit. Our engineering team.

00:19:23
<transcript>: oh it could

00:19:25
overra_dev: @adamdotdev tldr how the camera detection thing works. I'd try lobe or something like that to train a model to classify things but curious how you did it

00:19:31
<transcript>: Oh, it could definitely have been a figure engineering team, but don't individuals just use it if they want to. Or is there, like, a rule at your company? I've heard of this.

00:19:31
<transcript>: does your company out

00:19:34
<transcript>: Does your company outlaw it? Outlaw.

00:19:34
<transcript>: that's a extreme

00:19:34
devagrawal09: interesting, how do I become a streamer for watch dot dev

00:19:37
<transcript>: That's a extreme. I mean do they have rules against it.

00:19:41
<transcript>: I think if we're discussing software Dev topics.

00:19:41
<transcript>: it should

00:19:46
<transcript>: It should count here. You mean stay in software the software Dev category.

00:19:51
<transcript>: The tldr was about the camera Zoom. I think.

00:19:56
<transcript>: Tldr? Yeah.

00:19:56
<transcript>: oh teal

00:19:57
cowfacedude99: That means I can't watch you...

00:19:59
overra_dev: @adamdotdev I was replying to dev talking about starting livestreaming

00:20:06
<transcript>: Oh, teal tldr. How the camera detection things works. I try lobe or something like that to train a model to classify things. But curious how you did it. I used an offtheshelf facial facial expression.

00:20:09
<transcript>: Like a motion detection thing.

00:20:09
<transcript>: that run

00:20:11
<transcript>: That runs in the browser.

00:20:11
<transcript>: and it run

00:20:13
journey_in_ai: opencv?

00:20:15
<transcript>: And it runs in my overlay app if I weren't limited to running in the browser.

00:20:15
<transcript>: then

00:20:16
devagrawal09: the no and performance anxiety was for the camera zoom not working

00:20:18
overra_dev: lobe.ai

00:20:18
<transcript>: Then I could surely find something better.

00:20:18
<transcript>: but

00:20:21
<transcript>: But it's not a great model.

00:20:27
mattcoles: most large companies are worried about the legal impliciations of code generated with ai trained on opensource

00:20:28
overra_dev: you can export to web from that

00:20:36
<transcript>: How do I become a streamer for watch, dev. Yeah, deb, you just stream. You start streaming, and then you just tell me or dax, and we'll make you a streamer and watch that dev, we're ready to start onboarding. More streamers. We've got some stuff put in place.

00:20:38
devagrawal09: lol ez

00:20:42
mattcoles: as it can cause license issues

00:20:42
<transcript>: That means I can't watch you. What means you can't watch me? If I do, just chatting. You can't watch.

00:20:47
<transcript>: How's your father find a dev? Talking about starting live streaming. Oh.

00:20:51
<transcript>: I'm having a hard time this morning. The brain.

00:20:51
<transcript>: moving slow

00:20:52
<transcript>: Moving, slow.

00:20:55
<transcript>: Moving a bit slower than normal.

00:20:55
<transcript>: open season

00:20:58
<transcript>: Open Season Oh, yeah, that's an option, isn't it? There's a browser.

00:20:58
<transcript>: like browser

00:21:01
<transcript>: Like Browser bindings or Open CV.

00:21:05
<transcript>: The no and performance anxiety was for the camera. Zoom out, note.

00:21:07
overra_dev: no worries at all adam :)

00:21:13
<transcript>: You guys explain every single message you sent to me, what they were actually about. Okay, let's just get to work. Because.

00:21:16
<transcript>: My brain.

00:21:26
<transcript>: My brain. My brain. You can export to Web from that. Okay. Okay. Mostly, companies are worried about the legal implications of code generated with AI trained on open source.

00:21:26
<transcript>: interesting

00:21:28
<transcript>: Interesting.

00:21:28
<transcript>: i don't know

00:21:35
<transcript>: I don't know how they would ever sort all that out. Like how could ever accompany sue another company because of.

00:21:42
cowfacedude99: Wfo. I need to pretend like I am actually working while I am not doing anything LUL

00:21:44
<transcript>: The usage of chat gpt sounds like a legal nightmare that I would not want to be involved with. Oh, I see why they okay. I get it.

00:21:49
<transcript>: I need to pretend like I'm actually working while I'm not doing anything.

00:21:53
<transcript>: Oh, no, you have me up during work for office.

00:21:57
<transcript>: Just pretend like I'm a title on YouTube. You're learning.

00:21:57
<transcript>: so

00:21:59
devagrawal09: heyyy youre caught up

00:22:00
overra_dev: I don't use it for code as much as understanding and questioning things

00:22:02
<transcript>: So this is how we create a React app.

00:22:02
<transcript>: hey i'm caught up

00:22:03
<transcript>: Hey, I'm caught up.

00:22:03
<transcript>: i don't use it for

00:22:10
<transcript>: I don't use it for code as much as understanding and questioning things. Yeah, I love Chad gpt. I think it's fantastic. All right, let's do something.

00:22:20
<transcript>: And by doing something, I mean, get this tab Control finished. It's gonna drive me crazy.

00:22:20
<transcript>: who

00:22:21
overra_dev: DOING THINGS!

00:22:23
devagrawal09: @overra_dev can you question the purpose of life

00:22:30
<transcript>: Who knew Tab controls were the hardest thing in software dev. We're doing things. We're doing things. People. Let's do them. Okay.

00:22:34
<transcript>: This thing is gonna be the end of me.

00:22:34
<transcript>: so

00:22:35
overra_dev: harder than good printers

00:22:37
<transcript>: So peer check test does not work.

00:22:37
<transcript>: because

00:22:40
<transcript>: Because it's not a peer.

00:22:40
<transcript>: how

00:22:42
<transcript>: How, how.

00:22:43
fragaverage: Wasn't this a whole thing when co-pilot first launched

00:22:47
<transcript>: Am I gonna do this.

00:22:49
<transcript>: People, how am I gonna do it.

00:22:53
<transcript>: Let's talk about the content nested there. I shouldn't.

mattmancodes: 4 weeks later, Adam is still trying to get Tailwind to do the tab control on Statmuse

00:22:56
<transcript>: What.

00:23:00
<transcript>: 's this one. This is another. Okay. Yeah.

00:23:00
<transcript>: so then i've

00:23:05
<transcript>: So then I've got so I've got my tabs at the top, and then I've got the paint. This is how the dom needs to be structured.

00:23:05
<transcript>: the down eas

00:23:07
devagrawal09: LUL

00:23:10
<transcript>: The down eastructured, where the panel's are down below. Here.

00:23:10
<transcript>: and convince

00:23:14
<transcript>: And convinced of that. So I have to use javascript. I'm just gonna use javascript, whatever.

00:23:17
devagrawal09: just write a little bit of javascript and get it done with

00:23:18
<transcript>: Peak planer.

00:23:18
<transcript>: i'm

00:23:19
overra_dev: @overra_dev LUL

00:23:20
mattcoles: its still going on

00:23:27
<transcript>: I'm still trying to get tailwind to do this. Tap for tron status. Just dried a little bit of javascript. Yeah, yeah, we're just getting it done. I forget the css thing. I'm done with it. I'm over it.

00:23:42
<transcript>: I'm over it. I guess I'm gonna do javascript. Should I actually go back to having some components so I'm not just rewriting all this stuff every time I will do that after we get it working, let's get it working and then we'll make them in the components. If we think it makes sense.

00:23:44
<transcript>: So tab, one.

00:23:44
<transcript>: and

00:23:47
<transcript>: And tab. Two.

00:23:47
<transcript>: and we're gonna

00:23:49
<transcript>: And we're gonna say.

00:23:53
<transcript>: We're gonna say this.

00:23:53
doublesplinter: Is that hot coffee or iced coffee

00:24:01
<transcript>: Is maybe I'll just use like a naming convention. Is this bad tab? One panel.

00:24:09
<transcript>: This is a terrible idea for my javascript solution to just use a naming convention. And we're just gonna say it's hidden.

00:24:12
<transcript>: And then we're gonna say.

00:24:16
<transcript>: Let's see on.

00:24:16
<transcript>: click

00:24:17
<transcript>: Click so they'll.

00:24:17
<transcript>: radio button

00:24:24
<transcript>: Radio buttons. We don't have to make them radio buttons now, because we're not using this. We're using JavaScript.

00:24:24
<transcript>: right

00:24:25
<transcript>: Right.

00:24:32
<transcript>: Or I could use the radio buttons and just have like on change be the JavaScript.

00:24:37
<transcript>: What is there any benefit? Oh, there's benefit for the accessibility of it.

00:24:45
<transcript>: Double splinter. Is that hot coffee or ice coffee? Neither. It's hot dandy blend. I know it sounds as dumb as it is.

00:24:50
<transcript>: Sounds pretty dumb, is pretty dumb.

00:24:50
<transcript>: what did i

00:24:54
<transcript>: What did I miss here? Can you question the purpose of life harder than good printers.

00:24:57
doublesplinter: LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL

00:24:59
<transcript>: Wasn't this a whole thing when copilot first launched, you mean the legal stuff.

00:25:05
<transcript>: So I think I should keep the radio buttons to keep this thing accessible.

00:25:15
<transcript>: Like where you can navigate with your keyboard? Yeah? We're gonna do that? We're gonna say on what change.

00:25:19
<transcript>: On change.

00:25:23
<transcript>: Actually the way you do this in Astro is.

00:25:28
<transcript>: Also I need to actually fix the markup because.

00:25:28
<transcript>: broke

00:25:29
<transcript>: Broke.

00:25:31
<transcript>: Let's see. Duplicate.

00:25:38
<transcript>: News.

00:25:40
<transcript>: The real page up.

00:25:40
<transcript>: so this

00:25:41
<transcript>: So this.

00:25:47
<transcript>: I need to copy this markup because I actually broke the markup. Unfortunately.

00:25:55
<transcript>: It's this piece right here. Flex bd primary relative Mt. Six. So just means you reflect. Is that it.

00:25:57
<transcript>: Flex.

00:26:01
<transcript>: Bg primary.

00:26:12
<transcript>: Relative? Did I get relative? No.

00:26:12
<transcript>: should i have

00:26:15
<transcript>: Should I have relative? I guess.

00:26:15
<transcript>: rel

00:26:20
<transcript>: Relative. And then this flex one, AHA.

00:26:20
<transcript>: flex one

00:26:24
<transcript>: Flex One Text Center. What do I have? I don't have flex one.

00:26:27
<transcript>: Wonder why I removed that.

00:26:29
<transcript>: Sounds like a thing I would do.

00:26:31
<transcript>: Flex one.

00:26:38
<transcript>: All right, we're gonna knock this out so fast this morning, and then move on with life. Okay? We got team stats.

00:26:42
<transcript>: I don't love the way the cursor is all over the place.

00:26:52
<transcript>: So we need the visual indicator. That one is selected. How did I do see that's this thing down here.

00:27:03
<transcript>: I'll see. And we can just control that with JavaScript.

00:27:06
<transcript>: Okay.

00:27:10
<transcript>: Or I could just like hide it based on.

00:27:19
<transcript>: This one. Ha.

00:27:19
<transcript>: ha

00:27:21
<transcript>: Ha, what's the.

00:27:21
cowfacedude99: You said the same thing about the discord bot...

00:27:24
<transcript>: Watch this.

00:27:24
<transcript>: we're gonna say

00:27:26
<transcript>: We're gonna say.

00:27:31
<transcript>: We're gonna put it in here. It's not gonna be it's always gonna be with full.

00:27:31
<transcript>: i don't have to say

00:27:33
<transcript>: I don't have to say that's absolute.

00:27:38
<transcript>: Okay. I do have to say something.

00:27:38
<transcript>: what was

00:27:42
<transcript>: What was it left? Zero with 50%.

00:27:42
<transcript>: no

00:27:45
<transcript>: No, it's gonna be with full so absolute.

00:27:52
<transcript>: Inset. X zero. Height one bottom zero left. Zero doesn't need to be there.

00:27:54
<transcript>: Transition.

00:27:58
<transcript>: Oh, they had like, an animation.

00:28:03
<transcript>: This needs to be relative.

00:28:11
<transcript>: You said the same thing about the discord bot. Oh, you know, he's right.

00:28:11
<transcript>: coffee is right

00:28:17
<transcript>: Coffee is right. I did say that about the discord by I said of We're just knocking out real fast.

00:28:17
<transcript>: we did not

00:28:18
<transcript>: We did not.

00:28:18
<transcript>: we

00:28:21
<transcript>: We did not do that, did we.

00:28:25
<transcript>: Okay absolute inset X H one.

00:28:25
<transcript>: bottom

00:28:27
<transcript>: Bottom zero.

00:28:33
<transcript>: Okay. That works for making it just fit here.

00:28:33
<transcript>: and then

00:28:35
devagrawal09: that larabar looking beautiful

00:28:36
<transcript>: And then we can make it only visible if pierchain.

00:28:36
<transcript>: feels good

00:28:39
<transcript>: Feels good? Feels good? Feels good.

00:28:39
<transcript>: that

00:28:45
<transcript>: That larva are looking beautiful. Oh, did it switch to my. I must have switched to my thing.

00:28:49
<transcript>: Or you wouldn't have seen my lara bar.

00:28:52
<transcript>: So this one is going to be hidden.

00:28:56
<transcript>: Okay. Now I'm starting to see how this could be.

00:28:56
<transcript>: actually

00:28:59
<transcript>: Actually turned into a component.

00:28:59
<transcript>: pure

00:29:03
<transcript>: Pure, checked block. Or I guess absolutely.

00:29:07
<transcript>: That display absolute no position absolute so display.

00:29:07
<transcript>: hidden

00:29:09
<transcript>: Hidden.

00:29:21
<transcript>: Hidden peer check block. Cool. We're gonna add one of these to this tab. Yeah. These are definitely gonna be a component because that's a lot of redundant C.

00:29:21
<transcript>: bunch

00:29:22
<transcript>: Bunch.

00:29:26
<transcript>: Okay. So now if it's checked.

00:29:26
<transcript>: yes

00:29:28
<transcript>: Yes. See that.

00:29:28
<transcript>: oh but

00:29:34
<transcript>: Oh, but why didn't that one uncheck? You know, I'm saying, oh, cuz, I didn't make this relative.

00:29:38
<transcript>: Yeah. I need to add this to a component. This is getting painful.

00:29:38
<transcript>: okay

00:29:42
<transcript>: Okay, there we go. I don't have the animation.

00:29:45
<transcript>: And I don't know how I would.

00:29:45
<transcript>: with

00:29:47
<transcript>: With this method.

00:29:57
<transcript>: But it also doesn't let me click on the whole thing. It's only how I make the radio button like hit area, the whole thing. How would I do that.

00:29:59
<transcript>: How would I do that.

00:30:04
<transcript>: So the radio.

00:30:07
<transcript>: The radio thing.

00:30:12
<transcript>: Label. So it's just the label needs to be bigger. That's what it is.

00:30:12
<transcript>: let's look at how

00:30:14
<transcript>: Let's look at how they did it.

00:30:14
<transcript>: they don't use

00:30:17
<transcript>: They don't use radio to things.

00:30:23
<transcript>: So the label needs to be like a div. Let's do this. Y sat.

00:30:23
<transcript>: give

00:30:26
<transcript>: Give no.

00:30:28
<transcript>: I S A T.

00:30:32
<transcript>: We're gonna add a div.

00:30:32
<transcript>: and we're gonna

00:30:34
<transcript>: And we're gonna say.

00:30:36
<transcript>: Class.

00:30:39
<transcript>: Absolute inset zero.

00:30:43
<transcript>: And then flex just.

00:30:43
<transcript>: items

00:30:47
<transcript>: Items center justify Center.

00:30:54
<transcript>: But do I need to make the whole thing the label? Can I do that? Label.

00:30:57
<transcript>: No, I mean four.

00:31:01
<transcript>: That. Can you do that now.

00:31:01
<transcript>: can't do

00:31:03
<transcript>: Can't do that on here.

00:31:09
<transcript>: You know I'm trying to do am I now I'm trying to do trying to make the hit area.

00:31:09
<transcript>: the whole thing

00:31:11
<transcript>: The whole thing.

00:31:11
<transcript>: how it works

00:31:12
<transcript>: How It works.

00:31:12
<transcript>: i know

00:31:14
<transcript>: I know, I'm on stanley's. Com.

00:31:17
<transcript>: It did not work.

00:31:19
<transcript>: How do I do that.

00:31:23
<transcript>: Yet another challenge. It's the radio needs to be like.

00:31:23
<transcript>: a full

00:31:25
<transcript>: A full size of the thing.

00:31:30
<transcript>: Can I just make the radio like opacity Zero or something.

00:31:38
<transcript>: I actually need some smart, big brain programmer to tell me what to do here. How would I make this radio.

00:31:45
<transcript>: How to make the hit area of it the full size of the thing.

00:31:53
<transcript>: How would I do this.

00:31:53
<transcript>: how

00:31:55
<transcript>: How would I do it.

00:31:57
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:32:01
<transcript>: I don't care.

00:32:01
<transcript>: about the

00:32:01
devagrawal09: you put the radio input inside the label

00:32:02
unknownvs13: is it display block or inline?

00:32:09
<transcript>: About the animation. I've decided I don't care. You put the radio input inside the label. Ah AHA.

00:32:12
<transcript>: Display block or inline.

00:32:12
<transcript>: it's whatever it needs

00:32:14
<transcript>: It's whatever it needs to be.

00:32:14
<transcript>: welcome to

00:32:20
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Unknown. So let's go back to this this div. And then you're saying, put this.

00:32:26
<transcript>: Just look at the styling of the parent. Here.

00:32:31
<transcript>: You said inside the label.

00:32:36
<transcript>: Like this.

00:32:40
<transcript>: Put the radio input inside the label.

00:32:44
<transcript>: Then this styling.

00:32:49
<transcript>: What's should I do about this styling.

00:32:50
foobfoob: howdy

00:32:53
<transcript>: I just remove this.

00:32:53
<transcript>: let's remove it

00:32:54
<transcript>: Let's remove it.

00:32:54
<transcript>: howdy

00:32:56
<transcript>: Howdy food? What's going on.

00:33:01
<transcript>: How's it going? So try that what's that look like.

00:33:04
<transcript>: No.

00:33:04
<transcript>: i didn't do it

00:33:06
<transcript>: I didn't do it.

00:33:10
<transcript>: Okay. I should just think I should use my brain.

00:33:10
<transcript>: and think

00:33:11
<transcript>: And think.

00:33:15
<transcript>: This thing is flex one.

00:33:15
<transcript>: text center

00:33:18
<transcript>: Text, center text, White background, primary.

00:33:20
<transcript>: Has a padding.

00:33:20
<transcript>: curso

00:33:24
devagrawal09: huh that usually works

00:33:25
<transcript>: Cursor point so that padding immediately is going to make less clickable area.

00:33:27
<transcript>: So.

00:33:27
<transcript>: usually

00:33:31
<transcript>: Usually works. It might be that I have too much.

00:33:31
<transcript>: styling

00:33:34
<transcript>: Styling going on here or not enough.

00:33:37
foobfoob: AWS CDA exam postponed, OnVue messed up due to some software glitch again, I hate this company and software so much x_x

00:33:38
<transcript>: So this one is adding some.

00:33:41
<transcript>: Yaxis pattern, padding.

00:33:44
<transcript>: And that could be a problem.

00:33:47
<transcript>: You know what I'm saying.

00:33:49
<transcript>: Because that means.

00:33:54
<transcript>: The Radio Button kit at most be as big as.

00:33:58
<transcript>: That padding. Or go up to that padding, right.

00:34:03
unknownvs13: I suggest trying to make the label a block, with "block" class in tailwind. If label is like a span, then it's not going to be full width

00:34:04
<transcript>: Do I just not do the radio thing and build accessibility manually.

00:34:05
<transcript>: Is that better.

00:34:15
<transcript>: I suggest trying to make the label a block with block class and tail end. If we label is like a stand and it's not going to be full width.

00:34:18
<transcript>: So style this layer.

00:34:21
<transcript>: And say.

00:34:25
<transcript>: Make this Blocket doesn't default the block.

00:34:31
<transcript>: But what if I did all this styling on this absolute inset, zero.

00:34:37
<transcript>: Flex Items Center Justify Center.

00:34:39
<transcript>: I did that.

00:34:43
<transcript>: Now.

00:34:43
<transcript>: so i'm having

00:34:48
<transcript>: So I'm having to click on the actual text to select it.

00:34:51
<transcript>: And that's no good.

00:34:59
<transcript>: Now maybe I just need to.

00:35:06
<transcript>: Well, I feel like this example.

00:35:06
<transcript>: of

00:35:08
<transcript>: Of doing the radio thing.

00:35:10
devagrawal09: inspect element to see how much area the label is taking

00:35:16
<transcript>: That surely they've not had this problem like the whole box should be clickable inspect element sandwich area to label is taking yeah Yeah.

00:35:19
devagrawal09: it should take all that space to be clickable

00:35:20
<transcript>: Now very much.

00:35:23
<transcript>: It's just the text.

00:35:30
<transcript>: I need the whole thing to be clickable.

00:35:34
devagrawal09: you might want to make it block, full width and height

00:35:38
<transcript>: Should take all that space. Yeah. So we just need to label to take all the space and that should work.

00:35:44
<transcript>: Okay. Let's do this class. So he said, block, let's do block, block.

00:35:44
<transcript>: whistle

00:35:45
<transcript>: Whistle.

00:35:50
<transcript>: That looks like.

00:35:59
<transcript>: Okay. So now it's taking up more space.

00:36:03
<transcript>: Still not. Why can't I click on it now.

00:36:08
<transcript>: I can't seem to click on the radio now.

00:36:13
<transcript>: Just not good maybe if I move this back out.

00:36:17
<transcript>: Maybe if I move that back, I.

00:36:25
<transcript>: Just promising. Okay. Yeah. So now we're just dealing with the padding issue.

00:36:25
<transcript>: like

00:36:28
<transcript>: Like it's only full width.

00:36:28
<transcript>: but

00:36:31
devagrawal09: remove padding from parent div and apply it to label

00:36:36
foobfoob: remove the py-3 on the parent

00:36:38
<transcript>: But we need it to be full height to without so just absolutely position it. Let's just absolutely position it. Remove padding from parent Div and apply it to label.

00:36:38
<transcript>: oh yeah

00:36:39
beeut: Hey VoHiYo

00:36:40
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.

00:36:43
<transcript>: Ui, three, of course.

00:36:47
<transcript>: Okay. I'm going to make this thing.

00:36:47
<transcript>: also we

00:36:50
<transcript>: Also, we need to make the cursor. I need to fix the cursor.

00:36:50
<transcript>: cur

00:36:53
<transcript>: Cursor pointer.

00:36:56
<transcript>: Magnus, remove it from up here.

00:37:01
<transcript>: I need to make this a component because this is already getting annoying to keep track of two of them.

00:37:09
<transcript>: Yeah, yeah. Look at this. Look at it. Working. And now watch this. I bet I can tab.

00:37:16
<transcript>: And probably need a tab indicator. But look at that. I'm using my arrow keys. You don't know that because I'm not key casting.

00:37:20
<transcript>: Keycast oh, I left Docker on Oh.

00:37:23
<transcript>: Care.

00:37:29
<transcript>: Cool. We did it, guys. Remove the python. Yep, yep, yep, we did it. B. Ut is here.

00:37:32
<transcript>: Welcome beet. Also thank you for the following.

00:37:35
<transcript>: Sorry I missed that four minutes ago.

00:37:39
<transcript>: Alright.

00:37:42
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:37:49
<transcript>: We've figured out how to make the thing pick up the whole space. That's good.

00:37:49
<transcript>: it's it's

00:37:54
<transcript>: It's. It's more accessible than it was on Statmese.com. I need like a focus indicator.

00:38:04
<transcript>: We need some kind of focus indicator. Because right now there's not one. Let's do that. So it would be. I guess it'd be the rate. No. What would it be.

00:38:04
<transcript>: when

00:38:05
<transcript>: When the.

00:38:09
<transcript>: It might be when the input has focused right.

00:38:12
<transcript>: Might be.

00:38:16
<transcript>: I think it's on this thing. So.

00:38:16
<transcript>: like

00:38:18
<transcript>: Like peer focused.

00:38:22
<transcript>: How its style think of that follow.

00:38:26
<transcript>: Just the no JJ.

00:38:26
<transcript>: dys

00:38:29
<transcript>: Dys, and also symbol.

00:38:29
<transcript>: thank you for those

00:38:30
<transcript>: Thank you for those follows.

00:38:30
<transcript>: appreciate that

00:38:32
<transcript>: Appreciate that.

00:38:45
<transcript>: Maybe. Okay. First of all, how do I want to style it? I guess that's the first question. What do I want to do? Just do a little outliner in the whole box? I think so. I think we'll do a whole outline. I think that followed a cat. Kind of like cul de sac, but cold. A cat.

00:38:45
<transcript>: that's

00:38:47
<transcript>: That's cool.

00:38:49
<transcript>: So it's an outliner in the whole set.

00:39:01
<transcript>: I just do this because she's this one. So ring one or whatever. I think ring one. Let's just make it red because we'll figure out what to change it to in a second.

00:39:04
<transcript>: Okay not ideal.

00:39:04
<transcript>: it's not

00:39:07
<transcript>: It's not doing the.

00:39:10
<transcript>: That right line. Why did not do that.

00:39:12
<transcript>: This is just being over.

00:39:17
<transcript>: Okay, let me need to do it on the parents.

00:39:20
<transcript>: Up here. Maybe. What do we think.

00:39:25
<transcript>: Maybe.

00:39:28
<transcript>: Put on this one. Does it work.

00:39:28
<transcript>: ring one

00:39:29
<transcript>: Ring, one ring.

00:39:29
<transcript>: red

00:39:31
<transcript>: Red.

00:39:32
standardrobot: o/ adam

00:39:35
<transcript>: No.

00:39:40
<transcript>: Also bad standard robots. Here what's going on.

00:39:40
<transcript>: how are you

00:39:41
<transcript>: How are you.

00:39:47
<transcript>: Okay. So how do I get a bar? Is it just that the this one is overlapping? It probably.

00:39:50
<transcript>: Like if I look at this Div.

00:39:51
standardrobot: good good wbu

00:39:53
standardrobot: how's it hanging

00:39:53
<transcript>: Yeah, it's probably just overlapping. It. Right.

00:39:58
<transcript>: It's hanging.

00:39:58
<transcript>: good good

00:39:59
<transcript>: Good, good.

00:40:04
<transcript>: Yeah? Things are going well.

00:40:04
<transcript>: streaming

00:40:06
<transcript>: Streaming again enjoying that.

00:40:13
<transcript>: How do I get over this problem here? How do I fix this.

00:40:13
<transcript>: we're

00:40:17
<transcript>: We're good enough is like that a good enough indicator.

00:40:22
<transcript>: That it's focused.

00:40:31
<transcript>: Is that good enough indicator? I guess we could just have the whole tab control. Maybe it's a whole path control. Is that what it is? Maybe.

00:40:34
standardrobot: camera angle is cool

00:40:38
<transcript>: Up here, I just say, ring one ring.

00:40:38
<transcript>: red

00:40:42
standardrobot: for the desk

00:40:44
<transcript>: Red 500. Is this the answer? Camera angle is Cool. Yeah.

00:40:44
<transcript>: i got a little

00:40:47
<transcript>: I got a little moving camera moving around in the office.

00:40:47
<transcript>: add a little

00:40:49
<transcript>: Add a little spice.

00:40:49
<transcript>: is that

00:40:59
<transcript>: Is that a good focus indicator? I mean, not the actual red, not the implementation of it, but like the idea of highlighting the whole tab control when it gets focused, because that's kind of what has focus, isn't it.

00:41:02
<transcript>: Yeah, that makes sense.

00:41:02
<transcript>: makes sense

00:41:08
<transcript>: Makes sense. So we want to just do that if if any child has focused is that what it is.

00:41:08
<transcript>: child

00:41:10
<transcript>: Child.

00:41:14
<transcript>: No.

00:41:17
<transcript>: Oh, we can do this.

00:41:19
<transcript>: Like this.

00:41:23
<transcript>: And like.

00:41:23
<transcript>: we'll

00:41:25
<transcript>: We'll just say any input.

00:41:27
<transcript>: Focus.

00:41:30
<transcript>: Oh, or focus within.

00:41:32
<transcript>: As you focus with in.

00:41:35
<transcript>: I think I'm just too focused on that.

00:41:35
<transcript>: focus

00:41:37
<transcript>: Focus.

00:41:39
<transcript>: Is in.

00:41:44
<transcript>: Focus.

00:41:44
devagrawal09: this div does not have a direct input child

00:41:47
<transcript>: Within.

00:41:48
<transcript>: That.

00:41:55
<transcript>: If does not have a direct input child. Oh does that not file find any ancestor bummer.

00:42:00
<transcript>: There it is. Okay. So that works. We'll just focus with the.

00:42:00
<transcript>: now

00:42:04
<transcript>: Now it's actually style it to be not terrible, I guess.

00:42:04
<transcript>: what

00:42:07
<transcript>: What do I want to do that. Let's see.

00:42:16
<transcript>: Ring. Let's go to tailwind ui and look at how they do those little rings around stuff. It's not really like.

00:42:20
<transcript>: Samus is a very flat design.

00:42:24
<transcript>: So there's that I'm just looking for form.

00:42:25
<transcript>: forms

00:42:26
<transcript>: Forms.

00:42:33
<transcript>: Something form, layouts, input.

00:42:36
<transcript>: Radio Groups. What do we got here.

00:42:36
<transcript>: just

00:42:42
<transcript>: Just do input groups? Yeah. What do they do there? Like what's that? Focus ring.

00:42:50
<transcript>: Is that good.

00:42:50
<transcript>: do i want to

00:42:53
<transcript>: Do I want to different focus ringles. Just see what it looks like.

00:43:04
<transcript>: Ring. One ring. Inset. Ring. Gray. Oh, that's the actual outline.

00:43:04
<transcript>: and then

00:43:08
<transcript>: And then focus. Ring, two ring. Inset.

00:43:08
<transcript>: ring

00:43:11
<transcript>: Ring. Indigo. Okay.

00:43:17
<transcript>: Let's just try this.

00:43:22
<transcript>: Focus within ring. I can just change these. Right.

00:43:25
<transcript>: That's.

00:43:25
<transcript>: two

00:43:27
<transcript>: Two, and then focus within.

00:43:36
<transcript>: It's a ring insect, and then ring whatever color I want it to be, which we're gonna make it.

00:43:37
daglee: Why is it so much day left when the chocolate bar is eaten?!

00:43:38
devagrawal09: ooh did not know about focu-within

00:43:39
<transcript>: Primary.

00:43:45
<transcript>: There's probably like a secondary. Maybe that's better.

00:43:53
<transcript>: Oh, it does nothing. Why does it do nothing? Is it the inset.

00:43:53
<transcript>: is it

00:43:55
<transcript>: Is it the inset subpro.

00:43:57
<transcript>: Ring to.

00:44:01
<transcript>: Ring, primary.

00:44:06
<transcript>: Let's change that to ring secondary.

00:44:06
<transcript>: yeah

00:44:10
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. And then maybe not the inset thing.

00:44:16
<transcript>: Like this one.

00:44:18
<transcript>: Oh no.

00:44:22
<transcript>: Okay.

00:44:29
<transcript>: What that looks like? That's pretty bad.

00:44:33
<transcript>: Pretty bad but.

00:44:37
<transcript>: It's that these colors.

00:44:37
<transcript>: so maybe

00:44:38
<transcript>: So maybe it's fine.

00:44:38
<transcript>: maybe

00:44:40
<transcript>: Maybe it's fine.

00:44:40
<transcript>: for now

00:44:43
<transcript>: For now we can change it if we don't.

00:44:45
<transcript>: If we hate it.

00:44:45
<transcript>: cody

00:44:48
<transcript>: Cody, from Earth. Thank you for that follow.

00:44:53
devagrawal09: slight rounding maybe?

00:44:54
<transcript>: Why is it so much day left when the chocolate bar is eating.

00:44:57
<transcript>: Do you eat a chocolate bar every day? Dakly.

00:45:04
daglee: Yes.

00:45:08
<transcript>: Ooh. Slight rounding. So I don't know. Yeah, I guess that's slightly rounded. Yeah, yeah, well, the control's not slightly rounded, though. You know what I mean? Like.

00:45:08
<transcript>: i don't agree

00:45:11
oleksii_lisovyi: Heyo Adam and chat o/

00:45:16
<transcript>: I don't agree with the styling on Stanmes.com. I think we need an actual designer like David to come through and and actually.

00:45:16
<transcript>: design it

00:45:17
<transcript>: Design. It.

00:45:24
<transcript>: Because there's a lot of inconsistencies. But in terms of the focus, like it's, the control itself is square.

00:45:24
<transcript>: so like

00:45:27
<transcript>: So like should I round the focus or now.

00:45:29
daglee: But if my body could decide, I would eat 8 bars / day.

00:45:30
<transcript>: I'm saying.

00:45:37
<transcript>: My body could design. I would eat eight bars a day. I have the same problem. Daglie.

00:45:41
<transcript>: I'm supposed only one lara Bar day. And I want to eat like twelve.

00:45:46
<transcript>: Alexis. Here.

00:45:52
devagrawal09: why just one

00:45:53
<transcript>: Okay. I'm just gonna leave it for now and again. We're trying to get David involved. We'll get David.

00:45:53
perseuswp: oh thanks for reminding me i have a chocolate bar

00:45:54
<transcript>: To.

00:45:54
<transcript>: do

00:45:57
<transcript>: Do a pass on all this and make it look better.

00:46:09
<transcript>: I mean, the people who design Statmese.com today are very talented, but they're not application designers. They're like social media, creatives. And they made.

00:46:09
<transcript>: these design

00:46:13
<transcript>: These designs with what they know, and.

00:46:16
<transcript>: That's gonna work. We're gonna just do that.

00:46:29
<transcript>: Kind of looks bad, but I don't know. At least it's accessible. The current samus.com, you cannot navigate with the keyboard, so I feel like at least I've improved some things here. Like, see, it just jumps right over it. It's just a big.

00:46:29
<transcript>: boy

00:46:41
<transcript>: Boyd. Okay, let's move on. So I'm gonna make this a component. Now. I don't like the way it looks when it's focused. I don't like it at all. Maybe. No focus indicator. I don't know.

00:46:46
<transcript>: I don't know without a folks indicator I feel like.

00:46:46
<transcript>: how do you know

00:46:54
meltyheartselite: yoo that camera pan. how

00:46:56
<transcript>: How do you know that you've navigated onto it. You know, maybe you should be a Gray color. Just like a subtle, like a ring one. Okay, I'm stopping here.

00:47:02
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Melty Heart Elite. You know that camera pan? How.

00:47:08
<transcript>: Actually posted yesterday Things that follow I am observable I posted on Twitter yesterday.

00:47:10
zxshan: How do you stay active and fit while working from home @adamdotdev?

00:47:14
<transcript>: Some behind the scenes for this because I do get that question a lot. Welcome to chat.

00:47:19
<transcript>: First of all, mel T. But you can check out my Twitter. I don't know. Twitter.

00:47:19
<transcript>: twitter

00:47:22
adamdotdev: twitter.com/adamdotdev

00:47:30
<transcript>: Twitter.com Adam dev I've. Tweeted. Yesterday about I've got like a you can see footage of the rig that's behind my desk doing all that.

00:47:30
<transcript>: zx

00:47:31
zxshan: I try to workout in between pomodoro breaks but its difficult to stay on top

00:47:44
<transcript>: Zx Shannon, welcome to Chat. How do you stay active and fit while working from home? You know, this is the thing. This is the thing I need to be better about. And I wouldn't say I'm the most active and fit. I have periods of my life where I go through very intense.

00:47:47
meltyheartselite: oh nice ill go check it out. thanks

00:47:48
<transcript>: Active periods. And I'm like, pretty healthy.

00:47:48
<transcript>: i always eat really

00:47:53
<transcript>: I always eat really healthy. So that's one thing we've been plant based for like ten years now.

00:47:55
<transcript>: And.

00:48:06
<transcript>: Just nutrition is pretty important to my wife. She's really into it. So we eat really well, like we eat our £80 of vegetables a month. No joke.

00:48:06
<transcript>: but

00:48:11
<transcript>: But I don't always stay active as I should.

00:48:11
<transcript>: when it

00:48:17
devagrawal09: every year i have spikes of 1-2 weeks where i commit to working out, then i go back to being lazy

00:48:21
mecoupz: hi everyone

00:48:30
<transcript>: When it works, I've got something that's really like, I'm into, like, streaks work for me. I like when I have a street going, like some kind of active streak, like I've not. I don't use the watch one. For some reason, it's never clicked with me. But like, if I work out 30 minutes a day and I keep track of, there's an app that I use for streaks, that kind of help. Sometimes.

00:48:30
<transcript>: but

00:48:45
zxshan: I find if I start working out for the right reasons - i.e. it's fundamentally correct for me regardless of how I end up looking like - I keep it up longer, rather than downtooling every few weeks

00:48:46
okufa_f: was there any drastic body change that you had to get adjusted to when changing to a plant based diet

00:48:49
<transcript>: But my main thing is like, I need some kind of program. I need something that's telling me what to do every day. I can't just, like, wander into our workout room and do whatever I want. Like, it never goes well. I need to actually have a plan. Somebody telling me, this is what you're doing today. And this is what you're doing tomorrow. Because when I was the most fit in life, I was in, like, sports.

00:48:49
<transcript>: and

00:48:54
<transcript>: And in team sports, you've got, like, a weight training program. And you were forced to do these things.

00:48:54
<transcript>: and that's when

00:49:00
<transcript>: And that's when I've been the most fit. So I got to figure that out in adulthood, I haven't figured it out.

00:49:03
cowfacedude99: Get a gym membership

00:49:05
<transcript>: I try to work out in between pomadoro brakes, but it is difficult to standpop. It's so difficult.

00:49:05
<transcript>: so hard

00:49:11
<transcript>: So hard. There's always things going on. It always feels like, Well, it's busy right now, but I'll get to it. It's so hard.

00:49:13
<transcript>: Our.

00:49:13
<transcript>: sr

00:49:19
<transcript>: Sr. Romano Romano. Thank you for the follow. Just call Romano.

00:49:23
oleksii_lisovyi: Live is hard after all

00:49:28
oleksii_lisovyi: *life

00:49:28
<transcript>: You're welcome. Melty. Every year I have spikes of one or two weeks where I commit to working out, then I go back to being lazy, same dev, same.

00:49:34
cowfacedude99: I hit the gym so not to waste my money for membership LUL

00:49:39
devinda_me: whoa, early stream adam

00:49:40
<transcript>: Macups is here. I find if I start working out for the right reasons, I fundamentally correct for me, regardless of how you end up looking like, I keep it up longer rather than downtooling every few weeks. That's a good call.

00:49:50
<transcript>: Yeah. I want to do it for the health and the longevity of it because I know it's like a big risk factor to not be active. So I do want to do it for the right reasons. It's just hard to not get busy, you know.

00:49:52
developmentrobot: Nice to see you streaming consistently again, hopefully I can reach the 50K points for the 1 on 1 now :D

00:50:00
<transcript>: Was there any drastic body change that you had to get adjusted to when changing to a plant based, plant based diet? No cusa. It's been so long ago, it's hard to remember exactly. But.

00:50:00
<transcript>: we didn't do

00:50:04
rebeldecibel: for me, regular basketball with friends was the best activity which worked flawlessly

00:50:10
<transcript>: We didn't do it all at once. So we kind of like phase stuff out. In fact, it started not with plantsbased eating. It started with we're gonna cut out high fructose corn syrup, because here in America, at least.

00:50:10
<transcript>: every product

00:50:16
devagrawal09: i do ride a bicycle so I get some workout atleast

00:50:30
<transcript>: Every product on the shell has high fructose corn syrup in at least it did back then, ten years ago. So we started saying, we're cutting out high fructose corn syrup syrup and trans fats because they're just like plastic. And they're terrible for all the trans fats or plastic. They're just bad for your body. So we're gonna cut those out. And that meant we couldn't get a lot of the junk food we were getting before that. So my wife and I, when we got married, we were really young.

00:50:36
phdhorrible: I tried to go vegan when I was a vegetarian but the vegan cheese we had here was so bad I refused lol

00:50:40
<transcript>: No one should have led us in the grocery store alone, like we were just Loading up boxes of cereal and whatever else, like we did ate terribly the first few years of our marriage.

00:50:42
daglee: I once went for a 21km run, then I found that I hate running and never again.

00:50:49
<transcript>: So we finally kind of said, we need to do something about this. Eat better. We cut out those two things. And then it was like.

00:50:49
<transcript>: we tried

00:50:58
<transcript>: We tried cutting out red meat, and then we tried cutting out eggs like milk. We just slowly started facing things out over a period of, like six months, until eventually.

00:50:58
<transcript>: we were plan

00:51:02
<transcript>: We were plant based and we were whole food plant based. So we were mostly eating whole foods.

00:51:05
meltyheartselite: also watch out for eating fat and carbs at same time, as when its combines your body has a lot of trouble getting it out, turns sticky, and get a fatty liver

00:51:06
zxshan: @daglee lmao, I need to do my run today, dreading it :/

00:51:09
<transcript>: Yeah. That's how it worked for us. So it didn't make a drastic it was kind of a gradual thing, but our bodies were able to acclimate to.

00:51:09
<transcript>: i mean

00:51:17
<transcript>: I mean, we both lost a lot of weight just going plant based. You kind of get down to a more ideal way really easily. You don't have to try too hard.

00:51:17
<transcript>: even

00:51:18
jjdsea: FallWinning

00:51:21
<transcript>: Even when you're not that active, you're kind of like ideal weight, but.

00:51:26
<transcript>: Other than that, no dress exchanges. Get a gym membership.

00:51:26
<transcript>: that's that's

00:51:28
<transcript>: That's that's definitely an approach.

00:51:28
<transcript>: if you have

00:51:33
<transcript>: If you have to drive to a gym, you're gonna work out when you get there cause you drove there and it was work.

00:51:33
<transcript>: that's the problem with

00:51:36
devagrawal09: if you just want healthy eating, meal kit plans like hellofresh are a gamechanger

00:51:38
<transcript>: That's the problem with home gyms. We've got a pretty nice home gym. And it's hard because.

00:51:38
<transcript>: you can

00:51:41
mecoupz: or you could build an app for that :D

00:51:41
okufa_f: i tried to cut out meat one time, lasted only a month

00:51:45
<transcript>: You can just not walk in there. And if you don't commit to like, I'm gonna do something today. It's easy to just be lazy.

00:51:49
<transcript>: Life is hard. After all. I agree, alexey. It is hard.

00:51:49
<transcript>: harder for

00:51:56
<transcript>: Harder for you, though I feel like it's hard for me to say live, sorry, but I don't live in Ukraine. I'm not dealing with the things you're dealing with.

00:51:59
zxshan: I started rock climbing 3 times a week and it engaged my muscles and felt like a sport/activity without being in a gym

00:52:02
<transcript>: Much harder. I have the gym. So not to waste my money for membership. Yeah, that's a good call.

00:52:02
<transcript>: the vend

00:52:11
<transcript>: The venda early stream. Yeah. This is when I stream. It's a daylight Savings kind of through everything. Up an hour for people who aren't on daylight Savings. Which sucks.

00:52:11
<transcript>: but this

00:52:13
zxshan: Indoor Bouldering is quite nice

00:52:13
daglee: @zxshan I rather just bike. Or do squats. Squats is the worst and best at the same time.

00:52:14
<transcript>: But this is my normal stream time. Technically.

00:52:23
<transcript>: Nice to see you streaming consistently again. Hopefully I can reach the 500 points for the oneonone now. Ooh, love it development. Let's make it happen. I would love that.

00:52:24
devinda_me: ah daylight savings

00:52:27
<transcript>: Ah, Rebel Regular basketball's friends.

00:52:35
<transcript>: What was the best activity, which were flawlessly. Yeah. I used to play basketball early morning, a few days a week, and that was awesome.

00:52:37
<transcript>: I did enjoy that.

00:52:47
zxshan: @daglee Ah I need to do more squats, I thought my legs were strong but alas, I can hardly do 10 burpees

00:52:48
<transcript>: Do ride a bicycle. So I get some workout. At least I thought about getting like a pelletin because I feel people get I hear people get obsessed with it. And I'm very obsessive. So if I get to get obsessed with sweating.

00:52:48
<transcript>: that

00:52:50
<transcript>: That could be good for me.

00:53:00
<transcript>: But I don't want to, like, buy another thing and then not use it. You know, psu World. I tried to go vegan when I was a vegetarian, but the vegan cheese we had here was so bad I refused, so I'm.

00:53:05
<transcript>: Different levels of quality when it comes to vegan products on the shelves.

<transcript>: What was I talking about? Vegan. Oh, yeah. There's so many more vegan products on the shells. Now, though, it's almost a problem, because.

00:54:00
<transcript>: A lot of them aren't good for you. And they're very attractive when you've, like, lived your whole life. So ten years we've gone from, like, we couldn't buy anything at the store for fun. It's like we got the essentials that we need all the produce and grains or whatever, like what we actually eat. But this no, like, fun. Like Where's something that we want to eat. That sounds.

00:54:00
<transcript>: tasty

00:54:06
seb887: Hi Adam 🙋‍♂️

00:54:17
<transcript>: Tasty because nothing was vegan. Now, ten years later, there's so many things that are vegan, even here in the ozards at the store. And they're all very tempting, because we went so long without that kind of stuff. But generally it's junk food. And it makes you feel bad. And that's the struggle. Now we have too many options.

00:54:18
daglee: Lärabar are not good for you?! You can't live on lärabars?!

00:54:19
rebeldecibel: but boy, plant based food is just so expensive if you care to get all the nutritients you need...

00:54:29
<transcript>: I once went for a 20. 1 km run. Then I found that I hate running and never again I do hate running. I've got into ruckings.

00:54:29
<transcript>: so

00:54:33
<transcript>: So I put, like a 50 pound bag on my back. And I walk.

00:54:33
<transcript>: and that

00:54:51
<transcript>: And that I've enjoyed that because something about walking is just so much more enjoyable to me. The whole psychology. The entire time I'm running Ohio, no matter how slow I run, I just hate every second of it. I can be barely moving faster than I can walk. And it just I hate it. Something about my both my feet coming off the ground. Don't love it.

00:54:51
<transcript>: so

00:54:54
<transcript>: So I just I walk with a lot of weight on my back.

00:55:05
<transcript>: Melty. Also watch out for eating fat and carbs at the same time as when it combines. Your body has a lot of trouble getting it out turns sticky and get a fatty liver ooh. That sounds bad.

00:55:05
<transcript>: my wife knows

00:55:08
oleksii_lisovyi: That focus was suspicious.  https://clips.twitch.tv/PerfectLittleCrowPJSalt-VbJBBG0KSNF_bxm-

00:55:09
<transcript>: My wife knows a lot about nutrition and those things.

00:55:13
<transcript>: Jj D.

00:55:15
<transcript>: Crown.

00:55:15
<transcript>: who's that little

00:55:18
<transcript>: Who's that little guy fall winning.

00:55:18
<transcript>: if you just want

00:55:33
<transcript>: If you just want healthy eating meal kit plans like, Hello, fresh or game changer. Oh, interesting. I think my wife's used one of those sakara she used there's like, tons of thousands and stuff. Or you could build an app for that. Oh, I have talked about building an app for our nutrition.

00:55:36
<transcript>: I tried to cut out meat one time. Lasted only a month.

00:55:43
<transcript>: Yeah. I think, like, in America, we just eat too much meat. Like.

00:55:43
<transcript>: i think

00:55:57
rebeldecibel: probably eliminating alcohol would do wonders for most people :D

00:55:58
<transcript>: I think if you're gonna eat meat, I'm not like a purist that says, like, I know the way we eat is the only one true way. But I will say in America, people eat a lot of meat, like, way too much meat and just way too much dairy, way too many animals.

00:55:58
<transcript>: it's just bad

00:55:58
devagrawal09: so we're back to just chatting and adam being 20 minutes behind on chat

00:56:01
<transcript>: It's just bad for your health, like the cholesterol impact and all that.

00:56:17
<transcript>: I started rock climbing three times a week, and it engaged my muscles and felt like a sport activity without being a gym. That's the thing about activities. I want to get into something, some kind of an activity. Basketball did it for me for a while. Just something where you're having fun and you're not really thinking about the fact that you're sweating and working really hard.

00:56:26
<transcript>: The problem with just, like, weightlifting and other strength training that I do it's like all time. I'm just like, this sucks. Like it hurts.

00:56:27
neochromer: @adamdotdev Thats why I do HEMA

00:56:29
<transcript>: I want something that distracts me.

00:56:29
<transcript>: i did get

00:56:35
<transcript>: I did get into calisthenics for a while. That was fun. I was trying to get to where I could do, like, plants or whatever.

00:56:37
<transcript>: Which is very hard.

00:56:37
<transcript>: i rather

00:56:40
neochromer: HEMA = Historical European Martial Arts

00:56:41
<transcript>: I rather just bike or do squats. Squats is the worst and better.

00:56:41
<transcript>: is

00:56:43
zxshan: Bouldering is like a mental puzzle and physical - it's very enjoyable solo or with friends

00:56:54
<transcript>: Is the worst. There's nothing like Loading up a heavy bar and doing squats. You just, you know, you're gonna hate it, but you're gonna feel so good afterward. But you do. You feel like you're dying when you're doing real squats, like heavy work. Oof.

00:56:54
<transcript>: need

00:56:58
cowfacedude99: Get a partner while working out.

00:57:02
<transcript>: Need to do more squats. I thought my legs were strong, but the last second hardly do. Tin burpees. Yeah. Burpees suck. There's another thing that sucks.

00:57:09
<transcript>: The dax convince you for this confetti? No. Me coupes? I actually had the confetti. Long, long ago.

00:57:13
<transcript>: In my early days of streaming, we used the confetti.

00:57:13
<transcript>: for

00:57:15
<transcript>: For the raids.

00:57:23
<transcript>: Hey, seb, what's going on? Seb? Larbar are not good for you. You can't live on larabars. I mean, they're just like dates and nuts.

00:57:23
<transcript>: they're not the worst

00:57:26
<transcript>: They're not the worst for you. There are worse things.

00:57:32
<transcript>: Plant based food is just so expensive. If you care to get all the nutrients you need. Yeah, it can be expensive.

00:57:32
<transcript>: it can

00:57:36
<transcript>: It can be food is a big budget item for us.

00:57:36
<transcript>: in our house

00:57:42
<transcript>: In our house, we spend a lot of our money on food, but we kind of view it like an investment, you know? It's like.

00:57:42
<transcript>: instead of health

00:57:47
<transcript>: Instead of healthcare costs, we spend our money on food. That's the idea anyway.

00:57:57
<transcript>: That's focus was suspicious. Alexi, what focus? So did I focus on the lar bar.

00:58:03
<transcript>: Yeah. Eliminating alcohol. That would do unders. So we're back to just chatting an enemy. 20 minutes.

00:59:30
<transcript>: Probably too late. Okay, I'm gonna stop showing the clip now.

00:59:35
<transcript>: Alexey, did you want me to see the what did you say? You said.

00:59:35
<transcript>: that focus

00:59:37
<transcript>: That focus was suspicious.

00:59:37
<transcript>: that focus

00:59:40
<transcript>: That focus on the what did it focus on.

00:59:40
<transcript>: okay

00:59:42
<transcript>: Okay, I'm moving on.

00:59:42
<transcript>: we've done this

00:59:57
<transcript>: We've done this. I don't love the focus thing. In fact, I kind of hate it. How could I get the focus thing? I'm just. I'm turning it off. I just. It just looks so bad. I feel like this is a big nono in terms of accessibility or just usability.

00:59:57
<transcript>: i just

00:59:59
<transcript>: I just. It just looks bad.

00:59:59
<transcript>: i'd rather

01:00:05
<transcript>: I'd rather it. I don't know. I always choose aesthetic over everything. Don't I.

01:00:14
<transcript>: There's some other way I could make it indicated that it's focused. I could do a one Pixel Gray.

01:00:19
<transcript>: One Pixel Gray. Let's try that.

01:00:23
<transcript>: Secondary oh no.

01:00:26
rebeldecibel: are you using qwerty layout?

01:00:27
<transcript>: We're gonna do Gray.

01:00:31
<transcript>: Like that are using quirty yet.

01:00:36
<transcript>: I am not big brain enough to not use quirty. In fact, I'd be like learning a new language.

01:00:36
<transcript>: okay now

01:00:41
<transcript>: Okay, now I can't even see the folks indicator. It's too light.

01:00:48
<transcript>: About this.

01:00:51
<transcript>: That's better.

01:00:53
<transcript>: I don't love it.

01:00:53
<transcript>: but

01:00:54
<transcript>: But it's better.

01:00:59
<transcript>: Okay. Let's go with that.

01:01:01
<transcript>: This just still feels bad.

01:01:03
nofreewifi4u: there are people who dont use qwerty? :D

01:01:03
oleksii_lisovyi: That was a gachi style joke when you put your hand on the knee... forget about it.

01:01:06
<transcript>: Probably darker too if it's gonna be.

01:01:13
<transcript>: That's too dark.

01:01:19
<transcript>: No.

01:01:19
<transcript>: what did i just do

01:01:21
<transcript>: What did I just do? Why not.

01:01:21
<transcript>: do that

01:01:22
<transcript>: Do that.

01:01:22
<transcript>: i do that

01:01:29
rebeldecibel: I wonder why with all the mech keyboard hobby so few switched to more modern layouts :/

01:01:37
<transcript>: I do that occasionally. Where I just smashed this. Let's see, I smashed this key combination that is actually closed my terminal, and it's not ideal. Every time I do it, I'm a little upset. Oh, geez, docs. On myself.

01:01:41
<transcript>: Need to tmax.

01:01:42
<transcript>: a

01:01:44
<transcript>: A T zero.

01:01:44

01:01:45
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

01:01:50
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:01:57
<transcript>: That's fine.

01:01:57
<transcript>: it's not great

01:02:00
<transcript>: It's not great, but it's fine.

01:02:05
<transcript>: It's a gotchi style joke. When you put your hand on the knee, forget about it. What's Gotchy.

01:02:05
<transcript>: is this another

01:02:09
<transcript>: Is this another thing in pop culture? I don't know anything about Gotchi.

01:02:17
<transcript>: What is it? Gotchi style.

01:02:22
<transcript>: Some culture of adult movies that involve muscular males, wrestling and.

01:02:24
<transcript>: Okay.

<transcript>: oh gotcha

01:02:31
overra_dev: @adamdotdev https://twitter.com/KevinJPowell/status/1620800599271903233

01:02:39
<transcript>: Oh, gotcha. Okay, I'm trying to put it together here. I'm not gonna worry about it, alexey, but I feel like the joke went past me. I wonder why, with all the mech keyboard hobby, so few switched to more modern layouts. Oh, yeah? So tell me, Rebel, sell me on something.

01:02:39
<transcript>: non

01:02:40
<transcript>: Non.

01:02:40
<transcript>: non

<transcript>: I'll secrets are now revealed. I was actually slack, which I don't really use anymore.

01:02:54
rebeldecibel: I think the most popular was dvorak

01:02:58
<transcript>: I've just got a new video. The easy, simple improvement you can make to your CSS.

01:02:58
<transcript>: outlines

01:02:58
nofreewifi4u: what sorcery

01:02:59
daglee: dvorak, colemak, etc

01:03:03
<transcript>: Outlines are important, but maybe you've come up with a replacement, oh, oh, a replacement.

01:03:06
journey_in_ai: layers

01:03:19
<transcript>: You guys can't hear this, but.

01:03:27
<transcript>: Thank you for the phone.

01:03:30
overra_dev: it's short if you're interested

01:03:34
<transcript>: What's the solution.

01:03:38
<transcript>: Outline, color.

01:03:46
<transcript>: Interesting.

01:03:51
<transcript>: Okay, that's cool.

01:03:58
<transcript>: I didn't actually apply outline. None in this case because it's not a thing that would have an outline. It's just a div.

01:04:00
stormix_co: HELLO!

01:04:04
<transcript>: So I'm just gonna just stop now.

01:04:10
<transcript>: Let's see? Re accessibility and focus? Yeah, yeah, I just watched it.

01:04:10
overra_dev: ahh my bad

01:04:12
<transcript>: Quartz with a Z.

01:04:16
<transcript>: I think the most popular was divorc.

01:04:16
<transcript>: i know

01:04:19
<transcript>: I know. There's workman. Colemack? Yeah.

01:04:25
<transcript>: Hello? Stormix. Hello? Oh, you're fine. I'm fine.

01:04:25
<transcript>: you're fine

01:04:27
<transcript>: You're fine. Don't you worry about it.

01:04:27
<transcript>: okay

01:04:34
<transcript>: Okay, let's let's just keep moving. I'm gonna make a component now. I think I'm ready. Finally. Ready for a tab component.

01:04:37
<transcript>: And I guess we could do tab the.

01:04:44
<transcript>: Tabs component. So we're gonna have tab component, and we're gonna have tabs component.

01:04:48
<transcript>: So let's see. This is going to be the tab component.

01:04:50
nft_scam: tab zeh

01:04:52
<transcript>: This thing right here.

01:04:54
<transcript>: Yanket.

01:04:55
<transcript>: Habs.

01:05:00
<transcript>: Okay. Here's our tab.

01:05:09
<transcript>: And we're gonna clean this up. Let's see. That goes away. That goes away. What is we do here? We said the ID is dynamic.

01:05:15
<transcript>: I should probably make the I. D. Something that's passed in.

01:05:18
<transcript>: No.

01:05:21
<transcript>: Get is ideas past ten okay, cool.

01:05:24
<transcript>: And then check.

01:05:27
<transcript>: Okay.

01:05:27
<transcript>: and then

01:05:30
<transcript>: And then the label.

01:05:30
<transcript>: looks like

01:05:32
<transcript>: Looks like this.

01:05:37
<transcript>: The cars is different. So let's see, we need four to be dynamic.

01:05:40
<transcript>: Yank to their.

01:05:47
<transcript>: Okay. And then we need the insides.

01:05:47
<transcript>: of the thing

01:05:53
mecoupz: that tab-bg color with white text isnt so good imo. would use darker text color and lighter cyan or other way around

01:05:55
<transcript>: Of the thing. The insides, the guts of it. Astro. Props, label. Okay.

01:05:57
<transcript>: Cool.

01:06:09
<transcript>: And okay, that's our that's our Tab component.

01:06:09
<transcript>: hear me out

01:06:15
<transcript>: Hear me out. That's our test component. Now our tabs component. You're gonna pass in.

01:06:15
<transcript>: what are you gonna pass

01:06:18
<transcript>: What are you gonna pass in? You're gonna pass in.

01:06:20
<transcript>: The tabs.

01:06:20
<transcript>: or

01:06:22
<transcript>: Or.

01:06:29
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. You're right, Mccoups. The color contrast probably isn't good, is it.

01:06:29
<transcript>: we'll make it better

01:06:31
<transcript>: We'll make it better.

01:06:36
<transcript>: Let's see. We need to.

01:06:36
<transcript>: pass

01:06:39
<transcript>: Pass in something to the tabs component.

01:06:43
<transcript>: That's just like.

01:06:46
<transcript>: It's just a list of.

01:06:50
<transcript>: Ids.

01:06:56
<transcript>: Oh, and we could put the slots.

01:06:56
<transcript>: oh

01:06:58
<transcript>: Oh Oh.

01:07:00
okufa_f: you have some interesting side stuff on statmuse like bball periodic table and harden maze - is there any thoughts of expanding statmuse other than its current capabilities right now?

01:07:00
<transcript>: I have an idea.

01:07:00
<transcript>: i

01:07:06
<transcript>: I have an idea. So I'm gonna call it Tabs. I hate this, but I'm gonna call it tabs.

01:07:08
<transcript>: Just like that.

01:07:08
<transcript>: and then

01:07:12
<transcript>: And then you could also pass in no, no.

01:07:14
<transcript>: Thank you for that.

01:07:14
<transcript>: i don't know what

01:07:16
<transcript>: I don't know what it was yet.

01:07:36
<transcript>: I don't know what it was because there's no notification, but I think there's gonna be a notification that you subscribed or resubscribed or something. You have some interesting side stuff on statmes like bebop periodic Table and harden maze. Yeah. Is there any thoughts of expanding status other than its current capabilities right now? Yeah. Koopa, it's gonna change a lot, actually, that's why I'm here. We're changing.

01:07:37
oleksii_lisovyi: That was me @adamdotdev, no worries

01:07:44
<transcript>: We're gonna have, like, a whole bunch of new tools for content creators. People who, like, use Statmes for research. And they want to create content.

01:07:48
<transcript>: That's gonna be in the works. That's what I'm working on.

01:07:49
mecoupz: https://usecontrast.com is pretty good to check on AAA contrast

01:07:53
<transcript>: Alexi. Thank you for the resub. I'm guessing.

01:07:53
<transcript>: that's what

01:07:55
<transcript>: That's what that was.

01:08:00
<transcript>: I appreciate it use contrast is pretty good to check on aaa. Contrast.

01:08:00
<transcript>: i feel like i need

01:08:02
<transcript>: I feel like I need, like.

01:08:11
<transcript>: There should just be a neovan plugin for contracts. Right? Like that'd. Be cool. I think it somehow use tree sitter or something and figure out in the Dom.

01:08:11
<transcript>: like

01:08:21
<transcript>: Like this element has this background color because of this parent, and it's not enough contrast that'd be so cool. Actually, if it doesn't exist, someone make that that'd be cool.

01:08:21
<transcript>: please

01:08:22
<transcript>: Please.

01:08:30
<transcript>: Okay, so if you pass in tab.

01:08:35
<transcript>: We're gonna say Const IDs equals tab Astro.

01:08:35
<transcript>: props

01:08:36
<transcript>: Props.

01:08:36
<transcript>: tabs

01:08:38
<transcript>: Tabs.

01:08:40
fragaverage: Sounds more like a tailwind plugin tbh

01:08:40
<transcript>: Map.

01:08:42
daglee: You can make the background different depending on where you are in the code.

01:08:44
<transcript>: And this is gonna be random. Uid. Right.

01:08:48
<transcript>: Crypto random uuid.

01:08:50
<transcript>: Okay.

01:08:53
fragaverage: like if you could do `bg-red-500 text-contrast`

01:08:54
<transcript>: So I guess we'll know, I guess.

01:08:58
thdxr: Adam I loved your teaser this morning

01:08:58
<transcript>: We'll do like this.

01:08:58
<transcript>: no

01:09:01
<transcript>: No, we'll do like this.

01:09:06
<transcript>: And then we'll do.

01:09:06
<transcript>: id

01:09:09
<transcript>: Id. And then we're.

01:09:12
<transcript>: Name is tab.

01:09:15
<transcript>: So now we have.

01:09:17
<transcript>: Let's just rename this tab.

01:09:17
okufa_f: https://www.realapp.link/ is extremely popular amongst gen z right now, maybe you can try competing against it

01:09:21
<transcript>: Okay. So we have our tabs.

01:09:24
<transcript>: Title limb will do this titles.

01:09:26
<transcript>: Names.

01:09:30
<transcript>: Title.

01:09:35
devagrawal09: there was a teaser?

01:09:39
<transcript>: Da actually love my teachers this morning. Oh, yeah, that's very much DAX, like, thought process, right? I think you're rubbing off on me. Dax.

01:09:45
<transcript>: That's very much like it's hard, but you can do it. That's your thing. This should be titled.

01:09:57
<transcript>: Yeah. Has anybody else ever heard that like it's okay. None of us know what we're doing. I hear that a lot on Twitter.

01:10:00
<transcript>: Like we're all just making it up. We're not.

01:10:00
<transcript>: thinking

01:10:02
<transcript>: Thinking, what up.

01:10:12
<transcript>: Is extremely popular. Real applink is extremely popular amongst Jinzee right now. Maybe you can try competing against it. What is this.

01:10:12
<transcript>: is it

01:10:14
<transcript>: Is it a sports thing.

01:10:14
<transcript>: you can make

01:10:17
thdxr: It feels so good to know what you're doing

01:10:18
<transcript>: You can make the background different depending on where you are in the code.

01:10:26
<transcript>: That sounds more like a tailwind plugin. Oh, that makes sense. Frag, I missed some of these messages. Sorry.

01:10:26
<transcript>: like

01:10:34
<transcript>: Like if you could do background red, 500 text conference contrast. Oh, that's cool. Like, be as close to that color as you can, but darken it up in till you get there.

01:10:41
<transcript>: It feels so good to know what you're doing. Oh, you know what I'm doing next? You've done astro stuff or what.

01:10:41
<transcript>: oh

01:10:46
<transcript>: Oh, yeah. Sorry. I thought you made it felt so good to know what I was doing on stream.

01:10:47
thdxr: no I meant your teaser lmao

01:10:49
<transcript>: My series.

01:10:56
<transcript>: Real app social sport data discuss predicting compete live on real sports.

01:10:56
<transcript>: so

01:11:02
<transcript>: So. Yeah. I mean, we talked about doing live betting. We've definitely talked about it.

01:11:07
<transcript>: We're kind of close with the Draft Kings. Jason, the founder of Draft Kings.

01:11:08
rambo247: lakers better make the playoffs

01:11:11
<transcript>: Yeah, you met my teaser. I got it now DX.

01:11:18
<transcript>: So this allows you to.

01:11:22
<transcript>: Do bet. Oh, wait, no, you don't do you bet.

01:11:30
<transcript>: So what we talked about was doing, like, now that sports betting is legalizing in the US, we talked about doing, like, natural language bedding with your friends.

01:11:30
<transcript>: like

01:11:39
<transcript>: Like, hey, I bet you $20 that doesn't have 30 points this game. Or like, I bet he doesn't make a three this quarter. That kind of stuff. And like, we can actually parse that.

01:11:42
<transcript>: The text message.

01:11:42
<transcript>: and create

01:11:47
<transcript>: And create, like, a bet for you to accept or something. We talked about that.

01:11:47
<transcript>: just in our

01:11:51
<transcript>: Just in our laundry list of maybes.

01:11:56
<transcript>: Thank you for the tip, though. We do need to stay on top of the Gin Z stuff.

01:12:00
<transcript>: Okay. So these are our tabs. And now what we're gonna do.

01:12:00
<transcript>: is

01:12:02
<transcript>: Is we're gonna say.

01:12:07
<transcript>: Classless flex. So let's go back to our normal.

01:12:07
<transcript>: let's go back

01:12:07
sockthedev: i had an epiphany this morning. i realise that too often i learn and become competent with tech, only to end up moth'ing towards some new hot tech flame. i'm trying to minimise this right now. have a core set of technologies that i bet on, and only allow the libraries in the periphery to be switched out.

01:12:09
<transcript>: Let's go back to.

01:12:14
<transcript>: Mba box. Where here. So this is some stuff we definitely need to have.

01:12:20
<transcript>: Here we go.

01:12:22
<transcript>: Flex.

01:12:24
thdxr: no don't do that!

01:12:26
<transcript>: Thank you for that. Follow. Archerbird.

01:12:29
devagrawal09: back with coffee

01:12:35
<transcript>: So here we've got the slot. So what I'm thinking is, no, don't do that. What? Don't do what? Don't do what.

01:12:39
thdxr: beginners mind! keep being a beginner

01:12:40
<transcript>: I had an epiphany this morning. I realized that too often.

01:12:40
<transcript>: i learn

01:12:41
devagrawal09: after pulling an all nighter

01:12:43
thdxr: I was talking to sock

01:12:43
<transcript>: I learned and become competent with tech only to end up.

01:12:43
<transcript>: mothing

01:12:45
<transcript>: Mothing.

01:12:45
<transcript>: towards some

01:12:54
<transcript>: Towards some new hot tech flame. Oh, mothing, I get it. I'm trying to minimize this right now. Have a core set of technologies that I bet on. It only allow the libraries in the periphery.

01:12:54
<transcript>: to be switched out

01:12:55
<transcript>: To be switched out.

01:12:55
<transcript>: dax says

01:12:58
<transcript>: Dax says, no, don't do that.

01:12:58
<transcript>: and dev is back

01:13:01
<transcript>: And dev is back with coffee. Okay, I'm done.

01:13:01
<transcript>: ooh all night are playing

01:13:08
<transcript>: Ooh all night are playing. Plus coffee. I can. I can feel your body chemistry right now. I know that feeling like you're running on caffeine. It works.

01:13:10
sockthedev: dax just likes me to rewrite my app every week

01:13:12
<transcript>: But, man, you're gonna crash later. Why'd you stay up all night? Dev.

01:13:15
thdxr: remember being able to do all nighters

01:13:17
sockthedev: i think he has a running bet with frank

01:13:18
<transcript>: devin

01:13:18
<transcript>: devinner

01:13:19
<transcript>: Devinner.

01:13:24
devagrawal09: because i slept all evening lol

01:13:29
<transcript>: Zach, I said the same thing. Dev said that earlier, and I was like, I probably haven't done that in ten years. I don't think I could. If I tried, I would pass out at some point.

01:13:29
<transcript>: because you slept

01:13:31
<transcript>: Because you slept all evening. Okay.

01:13:33
<transcript>: Makes more sense.

01:13:33
<transcript>: okay

01:13:34
<transcript>: Okay.

01:13:34
<transcript>: so

01:13:37
thdxr: my entire life will fall apart if I do one all nighter, house of cards

01:13:39
<transcript>: So each of our tabs? We're gonna add.

01:13:39
<transcript>: as task

01:13:43
<transcript>: As Task Components tab. Like this. Okay.

01:13:45
<transcript>: And the data.

01:13:53
devagrawal09: it's spring break, no classes, so my sleep schedule is completely inverted

01:13:53
<transcript>: Oh, I need to, like, actually do this tabs map. Yeah.

01:13:56
<transcript>: Is gonna turn into a tab.

01:13:56
<transcript>: let's

01:14:01
<transcript>: Let's put is it data like what is the prop for tab.

01:14:04
<transcript>: Id label.

01:14:04
<transcript>: so i have to give

01:14:06
overra_dev: @devagrawal09 primeagenBig primeagenHands all nighter buddies

01:14:07
thdxr: quit school

01:14:08
<transcript>: So I have to give it an ID. Oh, that's easy. Oh.

01:14:08
<transcript>: if i just do

01:14:09
<transcript>: If I just do this.

01:14:14
<transcript>: What is that? Then I can do.

01:14:17
<transcript>: Like this. This is gonna be cool looking.

01:14:18
thdxr: where do you go to college

01:14:20
<transcript>: I'm all about the cool looking.

01:14:26
<transcript>: When it comes to development, my goal is, how can I make this code look cool.

01:14:27
devagrawal09: u cincinnati

01:14:31
<transcript>: Readable. I don't know. Maybe, but cool. You know.

01:14:37
<transcript>: It's spring break, no classes, and my sleep schedule is completely inverted.

01:14:37
<transcript>: interesting

01:14:38
<transcript>: Interesting.

01:14:38
<transcript>: yeah

01:14:41
<transcript>: Yeah. My entire life would fall apart. That's exactly right. Dev.

01:14:45
devagrawal09: @thdxr if it was up to me i wouldn't even have gone to college

01:14:46
<transcript>: Okay. So we map all the tabs, and then we have another.

01:14:46
<transcript>: this is gonna be

01:14:50
thdxr: oh my brother is in Indiana

01:14:51
<transcript>: This is gonna be like our panels. The slot here.

01:14:54
<transcript>: Okay. So interesting. I know to figure out.

01:15:05
<transcript>: Do I want to control these things, the visibility. I want the javascript to be in this component. Yes. I wanted to be in the tabs component.

01:15:11
<transcript>: I want it in here.

01:15:11
<transcript>: so how do i

01:15:17
devagrawal09: but it's a great way to immigrate into the US

01:15:20
<transcript>: So how do I control what's in the slot? How do I get the children from the slot? Astro gets children from slot.

01:15:26
<transcript>: So there's named.

01:15:29
<transcript>: There's Name, slots.

01:15:31
<transcript>: Mapping children.

01:15:41
shxtfxrd: could you have a named slot for each tab title passed?

01:15:58
<transcript>: How to map children in astro Component We'll demonstrate how to map children in the context of building carousel astro past children via slotting. When you evoke the component, you'll pass children to it. As in normal slotting. Contrary to normal slotting, do not place any slot in the component body.

01:15:58
blakegreendev: Having kids will invert your sleep schedule too lol

01:15:59
<transcript>: Okay.

01:16:02
<transcript>: Render the children.

01:16:02
<transcript>: element

01:16:06
<transcript>: Element in the front matter of the component using slots render really.

01:16:06
<transcript>: slotted

01:16:10
<transcript>: Slotted it renders the slotted. Children is raw HTML string.

01:16:13
<transcript>: What is happening here.

01:16:14
devagrawal09: @blakegreendev yeah my brother is going through that right now

01:16:21
<transcript>: What's.

01:16:22
<transcript>: I don't understand.

01:16:32
<transcript>: So.

01:16:42
<transcript>: Render this default slot raw HTML slides, and then parse them. So now I have these slides.

01:16:45
<transcript>: And what do I do with the slides? I map them and I create.

01:16:45
<transcript>: what

01:16:47
<transcript>: What.

01:16:52
<transcript>: They can wrap them in.

01:16:52
<transcript>: list

01:16:54
<transcript>: List Elements, I guess.

01:17:00
sockthedev: @thdxr i'm behind the idea of keep on learning, but for product dev i'm gonna try stick on a stack for a while. i need to stay in dev flow for a while after becoming an expert in a stack.

01:17:01
<transcript>: Oh, that could that could actually work for me. I could wrap them in divs that I can hide based on the IDs.

01:17:03
<transcript>: Welcome to chat.

01:17:03
<transcript>: schrod

01:17:09
<transcript>: Schrod because you have a name slot for each tab. Title path. Yes.

01:17:09
<transcript>: that

01:17:10
<transcript>: That's a good call.

01:17:16
<transcript>: That's a good call as long as there's no title it's the same shabby dumb yeah, Yeah.

01:17:20
blakegreendev: Not as fun as coding an all nighter though @devagrawal09

01:17:20
<transcript>: Having kids. Will invert your sleep. Schedule a blade. Blake. That's right. It will.

01:17:20
<transcript>: welcome

01:17:24
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Shakesped for I don't know if I told you welcome.

01:17:31
<transcript>: Okay.

01:17:31
<transcript>: this

01:17:34
<transcript>: This is actually maybe a good idea.

01:17:34
<transcript>: maybe

01:17:40
<transcript>: Maybe past children. So then when you have the carousel, you just pass cards.

01:17:40
<transcript>: think

01:17:42
<transcript>: Think the astro way.

01:17:46
<transcript>: What was that thinking? So much? I don't have a notification.

01:17:46
<transcript>: charlie

01:17:48
<transcript>: Charlie.

01:17:48
<transcript>: thank you for the

01:17:50
<transcript>: Thank you for the resub. Three months.

01:17:50
<transcript>: i appreciate

01:17:53
<transcript>: I appreciate that, Charlie. So much.

01:17:55
<transcript>: Thank you for your sub.

01:17:55
<transcript>: thank you thank

01:17:57
<transcript>: Thank you, thank you.

01:17:57
<transcript>: so

01:18:17
<transcript>: So think the Eschroy while mapping children Astro is made possible by the technique I just showcased. It's recommended to consider a different approach to see the same goal. Okay, because that did feel a little like hacky, didn't it? The arch chapter of Astro calls for different patterns. In the case of Care Shoulders, a simpler solution, simpler approach would be to create a carousel item component to wrap each childpass to carousel. Yep, this is more repetitive, but AV.

01:18:17
<transcript>: avoids the over

01:18:21
thdxr: yeah it's a balance

01:18:26
devagrawal09: @blakegreendev all nighter coding is _chef's kiss_

01:18:26
<transcript>: Avoids the overheads, the need to install a library. So overall, I consider it a better alternative. Okay. How the carousel component has changed those use of slot.

01:18:29
<transcript>: So here we have.

01:18:33
<transcript>: And which component? Is this.

01:18:37
<transcript>: Which I.

01:18:39
<transcript>: irace

01:18:42
<transcript>: Irace. Or this is carousel item.

01:18:47
<transcript>: Slide list and then slot. And then what do you pass into it.

01:18:47
<transcript>: this is

01:18:50
<transcript>: This is the carousel item component. Yep.

01:18:50
<transcript>: and this is how

01:18:50
thdxr: just wait till you all discover wake up early coding

01:18:54
<transcript>: And this is how you use them together. So carousel and carousel, item.

01:18:57
devagrawal09: especially with some heavy metal pumping on headphones on full volume

01:18:58
<transcript>: So you put the card inside of a carousel item.

01:18:59
thdxr: way better than all nighter coding

01:19:01
<transcript>: Okay.

01:19:09
<transcript>: Just wait till you all discover wake up early coding it's the best to me I think so.

01:19:15
<transcript>: Yeah. I've always enjoyed waking up early and working.

01:19:15
<transcript>: more so

01:19:17
thdxr: learn to worship the sun you heathens

01:19:26
<transcript>: More so than staying up late. But that's just me. I don't know. Or maybe it's maybe it's not just me. I hear people say, Learn to worship the sun, you heathens. Yeah. I hear people say that it's better.

01:19:26
<transcript>: there's like

01:19:31
devagrawal09: i am batman

01:19:34
<transcript>: There's like objective sleep patterns that are better than others. I don't know. There's books out there. I'm just gonna leave it to you guys to go find them and listen to them.

01:19:35
sockthedev: i'm an adhd'er so i really struggle not to want to keep learning new things. i love chasing new tech. 😅

01:19:35
<transcript>: I am Batman.

01:19:38
<transcript>: Okay.

01:19:38
<transcript>: so

01:19:41
<transcript>: So so there's a few approaches we can take here.

01:19:41
<transcript>: ultimately

01:19:42
<transcript>: Ultimately.

01:19:42
<transcript>: we could do

01:19:49
<transcript>: We could do named files for each tab name. I like this idea. So we have tabs map.

01:19:50
devagrawal09: batdev

01:19:51
<transcript>: Tab.

01:19:51
<transcript>: and this

01:19:54
<transcript>: And this is going to be a div.

01:19:57
<transcript>: Right.

01:20:01
<transcript>: No, it's gonna be a slot.

01:20:02
charliec97: I wonder what chatGPT answer would look like for mapping children in Astro

01:20:07
<transcript>: No, it'll be the name Slot. So like Slot. And it'll have a name, name.

01:20:10
<transcript>: The name will be tab.

01:20:10
<transcript>: id

01:20:11
<transcript>: Id.

01:20:11
<transcript>: or no

01:20:17
thdxr: I used to be a late night person but flipped in my mid 20s. think it is objectively better

01:20:17
<transcript>: Or no, the name, the label. So then if we have names, yeah, yeah, this could work. This could work.

01:20:17
<transcript>: there's no individual

01:20:21
<transcript>: There's no individual slot. There's multiple names, slots.

01:20:29
<transcript>: Yeah, I think this worked. Oh, this needs to be not inside of this thing, though.

01:20:32
<transcript>: You'd be like down here. So maybe we need a root.

01:20:32
<transcript>: might put like a

01:20:34
<transcript>: Might put like a root.

01:20:36
<transcript>: Around all this.

01:20:36
<transcript>: this

01:20:40
<transcript>: This feels weird for dolly. Naked. Out there, you know.

01:20:43
<transcript>: Okay. So if we do this.

01:20:43
<transcript>: and then we can

01:20:46
<transcript>: And then we can pass in.

01:20:46
<transcript>: titles

01:20:48
<transcript>: Titles. And that's it.

01:20:48
<transcript>: and then

01:20:55
devagrawal09: i like waking up early to go out and ride around town or play soccer

01:20:56
<transcript>: And then we slot based on the title names. Right? I love this. Now we can do all our job script in this component. This feels so good.

01:20:56
<transcript>: how did i not

01:21:01
<transcript>: How did I not discover this? Thank you so much. Give me that tip. Who gave me that tip.

01:21:04
devagrawal09: not that I've done that in a long time

01:21:05
<transcript>: I mean, we haven't seen it work yet, but assuming it works.

01:21:05
<transcript>: i'm scroll

01:21:12
<transcript>: I'm scrolling. I'm scrolling. It was Shicksforg Shake Shirt. I can't say your name. Shakesforched.

01:21:12
<transcript>: but thank you

01:21:17
<transcript>: But thank you so much for that tip you came into Chat. You dropped a knowledge bomb like that.

01:21:17
<transcript>: and

01:21:20
<transcript>: And here we are, I think we're gonna make it.

01:21:20
<transcript>: we're gonna make

01:21:22
<transcript>: We're gonna make it.

01:21:22
<transcript>: let's

01:21:26
<transcript>: Let's see, I guess I should put this Div.

01:21:26
<transcript>: on

01:21:26
thdxr: wait I missed it what is it

01:21:29
<transcript>: On the top element. Maybe.

01:21:40
<transcript>: On the whole element.

01:21:40
<transcript>: and then this

01:21:43
<transcript>: And then this one just gets a.

01:21:52
blakegreendev: I have a one year old kiddo and def cherishing the sleep when I can get it

01:21:52
nft_scam: explain to us

01:21:52
<transcript>: Little.

01:21:54
devagrawal09: wait i just realized you are using draculatheme

01:22:00
devagrawal09: let's gooo

01:22:02
<transcript>: Bit do I put all of the okay so this it wouldn't have that, though.

01:22:19
<transcript>: Guess any classes that I want unique to this will just stay in there. Okay. So something like this my be better. So the parent element would also have the panels in it. So if you want the component itself to only take up certain space, you need to be able to style this parent. Yeah, that makes sense. Then this part.

01:22:21
<transcript>: This part is going to be.

01:22:24
nft_scam: even the keyboard is dracula theme

01:22:31
<transcript>: Inside of that thing. Okay. So then we have each of our tabs, which are the clickable part, and then each of those tabs.

01:22:31
<transcript>: on click

01:22:32
<transcript>: On click.

01:22:32
<transcript>: we need to

01:22:35
<transcript>: We need to wire up the onclick handler here.

01:22:35
<transcript>: oh this is seal

01:22:37
<transcript>: Oh, this is sealing. So good.

01:22:37
<transcript>: this is

01:22:38

<transcript>: Tabs, not copilot, no.

01:27:14
<transcript>: It's gonna be labels.

01:27:20
<transcript>: And the labels are going to be.

01:27:23
<transcript>: An array of strings.

01:27:25
<transcript>: So teams that.

01:27:25
<transcript>: and

01:27:30
nzlaura: @devagrawal09 us mountain people gotta stick together

<transcript>: labels

01:27:34
<transcript>: Labels.

01:27:34
<transcript>: what's

01:27:38
<transcript>: What's wrong with that? Not assignable? Is it titles.

01:27:46
<transcript>: Titles. And then we have to do some fancy slotting here. Right.

01:27:53
<transcript>: Okay.

01:27:53
<transcript>: we have do some fancy

01:27:58

<transcript>: Named.

01:28:28
thdxr: her parents live in Miami lakes now

01:28:31
<transcript>: Slots. So slot name. And we have the names there that works. And then.

01:28:31
<transcript>: here

01:28:37
<transcript>: Here. We just put a slot property on the thing. Yes.

01:28:37
<transcript>: yes

01:28:40
<transcript>: Yes. So here's our first. Let's see.

01:28:41
thdxr: aka Hialeah but named different

01:28:45
<transcript>: Just close all these down here's. Our first Tab panel.

01:28:47
dnbull: I've taught a public school close there but kind of Miami-Lakes-ish area

01:28:50
<transcript>: Just delete that one I think for the follow guaca.

01:28:51
rambo247: oh nice. i came here when i was like 8 yrs old. im 25 now

01:28:54
<transcript>: Gowaca. So we just nest these things.

01:28:54
<transcript>: in here

01:28:56
<transcript>: In here. Right.

01:29:00
<transcript>: And the ID. We don't need an ID.

01:29:06
<transcript>: We just need to do slot. I don't need to do hidden either.

01:29:09
thdxr: my wife is Cuban

01:29:10
divyanshu934: Hi

01:29:13
<transcript>: this feels so good

01:29:15
<transcript>: This feels so good.

01:29:17
<transcript>: And then that should work.

01:29:17
<transcript>: and then

01:29:22
<transcript>: And then that's the content. And we're gonna do all the hiding in the javascript stuff in the task component.

01:29:22
<transcript>: okay

01:29:23
<transcript>: Okay.

01:29:26
dnbull: my wife-to-be is haitian :D

01:29:29
<transcript>: So I can delete all of this now. I think.

01:29:34
<transcript>: We need to add the players that flop.

01:29:42
<transcript>: Or just put a placeholder in there for now. So we'll just do Div.

01:29:42
<transcript>: slot

01:29:44
<transcript>: Slot equals playerstat.

01:29:45
rambo247: my wife is nowhere to be found

<transcript>: oh that

01:31:39
okufa_f: could you see yourself in the Ozarks for the rest of your life?

01:31:41

01:31:58
<transcript>: Great question at kufa. I love this question because.

01:31:59
traylortrash84: Good morning

01:32:07
<transcript>: We have our dream home here. Like we love this place so much. And we will never move our bowls. Never.

01:32:07
<transcript>: we move

01:32:09
<transcript>: We moved them twice.

01:32:15
<transcript>: When we went down to Florida, we moved down to naples, Florida, for, like six months. Move back.

01:32:18
dnbull: Hi-ah- LEE-Ah ?

01:32:19
thdxr: I'm a big fan of settling in hard

01:32:23
<transcript>: Lived in a rental while we built this house and then moved into this house. So it was like my oldest went through three moves in a pretty short time.

01:32:23
<transcript>: my youngest

01:32:33
<transcript>: My youngest, I guess, just went through one. But we just wanted them to be here just as a house sort of gonna grow up, and we love it. So we're in the ozarks for the at least the next 15 years.

01:32:35
<transcript>: But at some point.

01:32:37
<transcript>: In the future we could see.

01:32:39
thdxr: can eventually get a second place you go to consistently but good to put down roots

01:32:43
<transcript>: The conflict of we just don't really like anything else about the Ozarks.

01:32:43
<transcript>: except

01:32:45
thdxr: esp with your community

01:32:45
<transcript>: Except for this house.

01:32:48
thdxr: oh well...

01:32:49
<transcript>: There's just nothing for us here.

01:32:54
<transcript>: It's not really. We don't like socially aligned with the people here. We don't.

01:33:01
<transcript>: Just like every box? We don't really check like we don't really belong here. We kind of belong.

01:33:01
<transcript>: other

01:33:03
<transcript>: Other places in the us.

01:33:05
neochromer: yeah I feel you

01:33:17
<transcript>: Bye. But we grew up here. We have a really nice elementary, nice neighborhood. We're very thankful for all of that. So we're here for the kids growing up years. And then we'll see, I guess that's where we're at.

01:33:22
<transcript>: Dax big fan of settling in hard.

01:33:22
<transcript>: kind of

01:33:26
<transcript>: Kind of eventually get a second place. You go too consistently. Good to put Denveries. So that's a good point.

01:33:38
rambo247: gotta learn spanish lol

01:33:43
<transcript>: We have talked about like we can always just have another home somewhere that we like visiting, even just in the winters or something. Bk codes thanks so much that follow. I said that's a nonchalant. We could always just buy two homes. I'm sorry that sounds so like American and arrogant and whatever.

01:33:45
thdxr: I'm in the opposite situation, I love my community want to be here forever but my house needs to be 100% rebuilt

01:33:49
nft_scam: EZ flex

01:33:53
<transcript>: But like if we really wanted to be have a presence somewhere else, but like still have this home and still be in the ozarks. There is that path.

01:33:53
<transcript>: ris

01:33:58
<transcript>: Risandi Resnde 2000. Thanks for Chef o.

01:34:01
<transcript>: Especially with your community.

<transcript>: Yeah.

01:34:02
<transcript>: yeah

01:34:06
traylortrash84: I agree about the fitting in the Ozarks lol

01:34:10
<transcript>: Yeah, I feel you guys learn Spanish. I'm in the opposite situation. I love my community want to be here forever, but my house needs to be 100% rebuild.

01:34:20
<transcript>: That's fine. I agree about fitting in the Ozarks. Yeah. Trailer. You get it. If you're just, like, extremely online, you already don't fit into the Ozarks.

01:34:26
<transcript>: There's like an online community that I feel like we all belong to and there's.

01:34:26
<transcript>: a lot of

01:34:34
<transcript>: A lot of commonality just all over the world. The globalization of it, the ozark is sort of like the opposite of that. It's very like.

01:34:42
dnbull: Ozarks feels like a place to hide from the world

01:34:43
<transcript>: Not that which is good in some ways. Like it's good to have the like local community and the hyper local like stuff that you're involved with.

01:34:43
<transcript>: it's

01:34:47
thdxr: what do rich people in the Ozarks do for work

01:34:47
<transcript>: It's just. I don't know. There's a lot of stuff about it that.

01:34:50
<transcript>: Like we drove to Kansas city.

01:34:50
<transcript>: two days ago

01:34:51
<transcript>: Two days ago.

01:34:51
<transcript>: and

01:34:51
okufa_f: If you were to move in the next 20 years, which city could you see yourself settling in?

01:34:52
<transcript>: And.

01:34:57
<transcript>: There's like a few things just on the road on the way to Kansas City, from Springfield.

01:34:57
<transcript>: they're

01:35:03
<transcript>: They're just like no one would believe. So we're gonna take some pictures next time. Like you would not believe some of the stuff on the side of the road.

01:35:03
<transcript>: drive to the

01:35:13
<transcript>: Drive to the ozark. That's what I would say. There's just some stuff that, like that's unique. That's a unique thing. One of one kind of a thing.

01:35:13
<transcript>: like

01:35:16
<transcript>: Like. Well, I don't want to go into it, but.

01:35:23
thdxr: I used to drive from NY to Florida, lots of unique stuff on the side of the road lol

01:35:24
<transcript>: Oh, shark. Feels like a place to hide from the world. Yeah, it is kind of that. I guess it is tucked away. What are rich people in the ozarks do for work.

01:35:24
<transcript>: software develop

01:35:26

01:37:47

<transcript>: It's a cool series on Netflix. Yeah, that's right.

01:38:30
<transcript>: I'm just curious about what industries are big in different places. Yeah. The industries in the ozarks. Honestly. It's like where I grew up. It's a very small town. And you, if you want to live in that small town as an adult, you either work for the school.

01:38:30
<transcript>: or you work

01:38:32
<transcript>: Or you work for the Highway Department.

01:38:34
<transcript>: Or.

01:38:48
<transcript>: it's like

01:38:53
<transcript>: It's like a lot of young doctors, doctors that live here while they're learning to be a doctor. And then they move off the big city.

01:38:58
<transcript>: I think that's a true for a lot of like middle market cities like this. It's not a big city.

01:38:59
dnbull: @dnbull If i was younger and desperate I would have taken it but my priorities are different

01:39:02
<transcript>: So you either go into like health care or.

01:39:07
<transcript>: School systems.

01:39:07
<transcript>: i don't know

01:39:11
rambo247: makes sense

01:39:11
beeut: Now i want to go to the supermarket and buy some chocolates :D

<transcript>: Rich people like here in Nixa, specifically, I swear. It's all fast food restaurants and clinics like that's. It. Those are the businesses. Nixa.

01:39:21
<transcript>: it's like

<transcript>: It's like eat really bad. And then when you need health care, there's the clinic.

01:39:26
<transcript>: they're all right next

01:39:28
<transcript>: They're all right next to each other.

01:39:33
<transcript>: Rich people say they work much, but they don't. Yeah, that's true.

01:39:33
<transcript>: more

01:39:39
<transcript>: More money, less work. To be honest, I thought ozark was just a TV show. Had no idea it was an actual place.

01:39:39
<transcript>: it is actually

01:39:41
<transcript>: It is actually a place.

01:39:49
<transcript>: That's funny. Miami. It's all real estate or some random business. Someone started and got huge. Yeah, there's some business owners. Not a lot here, but.

01:39:49
<transcript>: no

01:39:51
<transcript>: No neocromers are naples, Florida.

01:41:06
dinisskizee: @thdxr what makes you stay in Miami? Doesnt it take an hour to go anywhere every time?

01:41:06
<transcript>: I am so bummed.

01:41:10
<transcript>: So we can't do this slot name thing.

01:41:10
<transcript>: and i would

01:41:12
<transcript>: And I would be nice.

01:41:18
dinisskizee: HeyGuys

01:41:19
<transcript>: We're gonna have to have a new approach, then.

01:41:23
<transcript>: New approach.

01:41:23
thdxr: @rambo247 no I'm not from here originally I met my wife in NY. she had to leave Miami to get into tech but totally possible now since remote is more normal

01:41:31
<transcript>: The New approach.

01:41:33
<transcript>: Is.

01:41:35
<transcript>: What.

01:41:48
<transcript>: I need a smart person.

01:41:51
<transcript>: I need a smart version to figure this out.

01:41:56
<transcript>: We could just render the children, but we need to be able to wrap them all.

01:41:56
thdxr: @dinisskizee I use my car once a week at most, I live in a completely walkable area

01:42:00
<transcript>: We do what that guy did. That one guy.

01:42:05
<transcript>: That guy, tomas chappell, could we do this thing.

01:42:08
<transcript>: Where we render the slot.

01:42:13
<transcript>: And then we parse them.

01:42:13
thdxr: also I have a weird schedule so when I do drive it's not that busy

01:42:19
<transcript>: No to HTML parser. That sounds so bad.

01:42:25
<transcript>: Sounds so messy, you know.

01:42:29
<transcript>: What do we think.

01:42:38
dnbull: I went from driving 50 miles a day to like twice a month now @thdxr LUL

01:42:40
devagrawal09: i live close to the university so a lot of things are in walking/biking distance, it's great

01:42:42
<transcript>: I don't know what to think.

01:42:57
<transcript>: Just waiting for somebody give me the answer somebody to give me the answer.

01:43:00
<transcript>: This Fox.

01:43:07
<transcript>: We had we had such a good solution.

01:43:10
<transcript>: It just doesn't work. You can't do it.

01:43:10
<transcript>: bummer

01:43:12
<transcript>: Bummer.

01:43:14
dinisskizee: @thdxr It's a city in my future considerations. If you would move anywhere, where would it be? Salary + Quality of Life.

01:43:18
thdxr: @dnbull yeah it's amazing. having lived in NYC for 10 years didn't want to switch to a car lifestyle

01:43:19
<transcript>: Okay, so this is too messy. I'm not. I don't like this. I don't like parsing the HTML string.

01:43:19
<transcript>: that just sounds

01:43:21
<transcript>: That just sounds bad.

01:43:26
<transcript>: So how else could we look at the children of an Astro component.

01:43:30
<transcript>: Ex children in slot.

01:43:35
<transcript>: How could we do this? Access slot content.

01:43:37
<transcript>: Oh, it's closed.

01:43:41
<transcript>: How could we do this.

01:43:48
<transcript>: Oh, this is where they came up with name slots, isn't it.

01:43:52
<transcript>: No.

01:43:55
dnbull: I dont mind driving but the traffic is not enjoyable at all. I hate it so much lol

01:43:56
thdxr: @dinisskizee I just had that choice and chose Miami, settling down here for the long term. love the culture, people and weather

01:43:56
<transcript>: Okay now never mind.

01:43:58
stroopwafel26: Hello!

01:45:35
<transcript>: you slide on

01:45:42

01:45:42
rambo247: i joined the discord, wrote a beautiful introduction message

<transcript>: Oh.

01:45:46

01:45:55
<transcript>: Some.

01:45:55
<transcript>: knowledge

01:45:56
devagrawal09: @thdxr LUL unfortunately not but a conference of conspiracy theorists sounds amazing

01:45:58
<transcript>: Knowledge like you're gonna have to be smart enough.

01:46:02

01:46:56
<transcript>: That sounds very promising. What is that.

01:46:59
<transcript>: What is that? Let's look at that.

01:47:01
<transcript>: Look at it.

01:47:01
<transcript>: astro

01:47:04
<transcript>: Astro slots runtime.

01:47:04
<transcript>: has

01:47:05
<transcript>: Has.

01:47:11
<transcript>: You can check whether content name exists with Azure slots has Oh.

01:47:11
<transcript>: this can be useful

01:47:13
stroopwafel26: dat keyboard shot tho

01:47:17
<transcript>: This can be useful when you want to wrap slop fuck content, but only once you render the wrapper elements when the slides being used.

01:47:20
<transcript>: That sounds exactly like what I need.

01:47:23
<transcript>: Plus has more.

01:47:25
<transcript>: Well, maybe. Does it.

01:47:32
<transcript>: Content for specific slides name exists with.

01:47:37
<transcript>: This can be useful when you want to wrap slot contents, but only when to render the.

01:47:40
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, no, that could work.

01:47:43
<transcript>: Maybe.

01:47:51
<transcript>: Cut it. Wait. If that can't be a variable, this can't be a very.

01:47:56
<transcript>: Stack.

01:47:56
<transcript>: name

01:47:58
<transcript>: Name, but I don't.

01:48:06
<transcript>: Astro slots render asynchronously render the contents of the slot twist.

01:48:10
<transcript>: But then what would I do? You know.

01:48:14
<transcript>: Then I just have a big string of HTML.

01:48:23
<transcript>: Optional except the second argument array of parameters that we forwarded to any function children.

01:48:29
<transcript>: For example, Shout Component converts its message prop to uppercase and passes it to the default slot.

01:48:29
<transcript>: think about

<transcript>: Will you share this work on github? Welcome to Chatforce of all sienna. Second of all.

01:49:25
<transcript>: You know, my cofounder wants to make a lot more of satin's stuff open source.

01:49:25
<transcript>: so it's

01:49:33
<transcript>: So it's very possible that we will do that. We're probably not there yet. Well, I guess this repo might just be public. We might just make a public. We'll see.

01:49:37
<transcript>: You know who doesn't have a checkmark? Ouch, dax, Ouch.

01:49:40
<transcript>: Out.

01:49:43
<transcript>: Connie is a big boy.

01:49:48
konni: @thdxr konniWTF

01:49:49
<transcript>: I don't know enough about twitch to figure out. Connie. What do you stream? Are you a developer.

01:49:55
<transcript>: Do you stream software development or games or other things.

01:49:57
<transcript>: Or others.

01:50:02
<transcript>: Oh, is that you.

01:50:05
<transcript>: youote of you

01:50:06
<transcript>: Youote of you.

01:50:09
<transcript>: Now, I know what you look like. Connie.

01:50:13
konni: Yeah, that's me :)

01:50:14
stroopwafel26: it's just a 24/7 stream of a checkmark

01:50:21
<transcript>: This is a 24/7 stream of a check Mark.

01:50:29
<transcript>: Okay, we got to figure this out. I could just do the ID thing. It relies on, like.

01:50:29
<transcript>: some

01:50:30
<transcript>: Some.

01:50:31
konni: I stream games mainly, but variety. So today is Diablo 4 beta start. Next week I probably play Guild Wara 2. So it depends.

01:50:41
<transcript>: Some things I don't like, like you could mess this up if you're using the component, but you know what? This component is not for us people. It's just for me. And have I ever forgotten anything that I've written.

01:50:41
<transcript>: every single

01:50:47
<transcript>: Every single time I write something other than that, I think this could not in badly. It's gonna go well.

01:50:52
<transcript>: We're gonna go with this approach. Dev is from Cincinnati. That's right.

01:50:52
<transcript>: gains

01:51:08
<transcript>: Gains mainly, but variety. So today's diablo Four beta start next week. I probably play guild Wars Two, so it depends. Okay. Cool. I wonder, like if ever the gaming crowd on Twitter just wanders into the software and Dev category and they're like, hey, what's this all about.

01:51:14
<transcript>: We mostly we write software, but mostly we get nothing done.

01:51:14
<transcript>: like i don't

01:51:14
stroopwafel26: @Konni Followed bc you're from Germany

01:51:18
<transcript>: Like I don't get much done. I guess there are there's two step streamers that get stuff done.

01:51:21
<transcript>: I just don't.

01:51:25
fragaverage: WE?!

01:51:30
<transcript>: Okay, let's get let's get this figured out so we can't do the slot name thing. This is no good.

01:51:30
<transcript>: we

01:51:31
<transcript>: We.

01:51:36
fragaverage: Don't brush your lack of productivity onto us LUL

01:51:38
<transcript>: We frag like we get nothing done. You guys get stuff done. I just don't get anything done.

01:51:43
<transcript>: Okay.

01:51:43
<transcript>: i

01:51:45
<transcript>: I want to.

01:51:45
<transcript>: get rid

01:51:48
<transcript>: Get rid of this. I can't use that.

01:51:51
<transcript>: Thanks for follow Ninja.

01:51:51
<transcript>: ninja

01:51:53
<transcript>: Ninja bit.

01:51:55
thdxr: I get less done while watching Adam than when streaming myself

01:52:11
<transcript>: So I can't actually do anything with the dom. I just have to render the slot like a dummy. I just gotta render it. And then down here we just have to assume that the ID is the name of the tab, the label of the tab. That's it.

01:52:14
<transcript>: Okay.

01:52:18
<transcript>: I'm doing it for me.

01:52:18
<transcript>: starting the

01:52:20
<transcript>: Starting the fold. Playlist over.

01:52:29
<transcript>: Okay, some start writing some javascript, I guess.

01:52:37
<transcript>: The tab. Oh, I need to put the on change handlers on each tab, and the way I'm going to do that.

01:52:37
<transcript>: is we're gonna

01:52:42
<transcript>: Is we're gonna make each tab have a class that's distinctive.

01:52:42
<transcript>: like

01:52:45
<transcript>: Like tap. Okay.

01:52:49
<transcript>: So tab has a tab class.

01:52:49
<transcript>: and then in here

01:52:50
<transcript>: And then in here.

01:52:50
<transcript>: there's like

01:52:53
konni: Hehe, I think Twitch is open for everyone and at least for myself, I like to see lots of different content. I started off with learning JavaScript last year and was streaming my first steps, too :) But then real life kicked in and there was no time to proceed. But I was always fascinated by coding.

01:52:54
<transcript>: There's like a pattern for this Astro has it in their docs.

01:52:57
<transcript>: For script, stuff.

01:53:00
<transcript>: Script, stuff, script.

01:53:03
<transcript>: Scripts.

01:53:03
konni: @Konni Oh, thanks :) You, too?

01:53:07
<transcript>: Type script scripts in event handling. Here we go.

01:53:27
<transcript>: Dax gets less done while he watches me. I'm sorry, dax. We really should not watch each other streams so we can actually get rebates done. I think twitch is open for everyone, and at least for myself. I like to see lots of different content start off with learning jobs. Good last year. Oh, it was streaming my first steps too. But then life real life kicked.

01:53:27
<transcript>: in there was no

01:53:29
siennaxxxxx: the multicam is great

01:53:31
<transcript>: In. There was no time to proceed. Always. I coding. That's cool.

01:53:36
<transcript>: Stream Games mainly.

01:53:43
<transcript>: The, YouTube.

01:53:46
devagrawal09: yeah the variety on twitch is amazing, it's unfortunate that discovery sucks

01:53:47
<transcript>: We asking me something common when you said YouTube.

01:53:49
<transcript>: Stream Games mainly.

01:53:49
<transcript>: but varie

01:54:03
<transcript>: But varieties of today is yeah before I don't think you were asking me me, me too, but I'm gonna I'm gonna answer YouTube because I actually played a game recently. I've injured off into your category and I played among us. It was my first time I was so bad.

01:54:04
dinisskizee: A lot of people are starting to learn, maybe its something you could try in your stream, maybe it works to do both at the same time

01:54:09
<transcript>: Like so bad. I was mostly standing around. It took me forever to figure out that, like the map shows you where.

01:54:09
<transcript>: your tasks are

01:54:20
<transcript>: Your tasks are. So I'm like just reading the task description. Like, how much was another reactor? Is like what? And it's on the map. But I did play among us. I didn't stream it myself.

01:54:20
<transcript>: but

01:54:25
<transcript>: But there were a bunch of Dev streamers. We all played among us, and they were streaming it. It was a good time.

01:54:25
<transcript>: it was a good

01:54:27
<transcript>: It was a good time.

01:54:29
<transcript>: But I was very terrible.

01:54:36
<transcript>: A lot of people are starting to learn. Maybe it's something you could try on your stream. Maybe it works to do both at the same time.

01:54:36
<transcript>: learning

01:54:39
<transcript>: Learning javascript. You mean.

01:54:41
devagrawal09: i follow a channel called KittenClubhouse which literally streams a bunch of cars living in a house

01:54:42
<transcript>: I'll let gaming and learning job script.

01:54:45
devagrawal09: cats*

01:54:45
<transcript>: Okay. Here's what we're gonna do.

01:54:47
thdxr: I should learn js on my stream

01:54:47
dinisskizee: Speaking to Konni*

01:54:51
<transcript>: This is the pattern. No, that's not the pattern. Web components. No, this one.

01:54:51
<transcript>: handle

01:54:53
konni: I like your creative setup with the multicam.

01:54:54
<transcript>: Handle onclick and other events. So here we go.

01:54:58
<transcript>: Here we go.

01:55:02
<transcript>: So we're gonna do.

01:55:08
stroopwafel26: @thdxr i found this cool thing called sst, maybe that's something you can stream once

01:55:11
<transcript>: So I'm just gonna delete that. And let's say tab. So if they have the class tab, that's all.

01:55:13
<transcript>: Tabs. Okay.

01:55:18
<transcript>: And for each tab, we're gonna add.

01:55:18
<transcript>: a

01:55:19
<transcript>: A.

01:55:19
<transcript>: eventless

01:55:30
<transcript>: Eventlessner on not click it's gonna be on change. How does that work? If it's click add event, listener change.

01:55:33
<transcript>: Now I don't know if it's.

01:55:36
<transcript>: Html, JavaScript.

01:55:36
<transcript>: javascript

01:55:38
<transcript>: Javascript.

01:55:41
<transcript>: Ad event listener.

01:55:50
<transcript>: On change? I don't know if it's on change or if it'd be different. Change event change? Yeah? So on change is for the change event.

01:55:50
<transcript>: and then

01:55:53
<transcript>: And then right now it's just alerting.

01:55:55
<transcript>: That's fine.

01:56:00
<transcript>: Tab was click, but what I actually want.

01:56:00
<transcript>: tab

01:56:02
<transcript>: Tab has changed.

01:56:08
<transcript>: With the Temporary alert.

01:56:13
<transcript>: Connie, I like your creative setup with the bulk of Cam. Yeah, I know. I put a ton of work into.

01:56:19
<transcript>: The production side of My Thing because it's only so fun to watch somebody.

01:56:19
<transcript>: write like fifteen

01:56:22
<transcript>: Write like 15 lines of code on a four hour stream.

01:56:25
<transcript>: So we have to throw in something.

01:56:25
<transcript>: people

01:56:27
<transcript>: People to enjoy.

01:56:32
konni: Production value is great. Love it.

01:56:34
<transcript>: I follow a channel called kitten clubhouse, which literally streams a bunch of cars living in a house. What.

01:56:34
<transcript>: cars

01:56:37
<transcript>: Cars? Did you mean to say kittens.

01:56:37
<transcript>: a bunch

01:56:43
<transcript>: A bunch of cats. Cats living in a house that's interesting. The car's living in the house is interesting as well.

01:56:46
thdxr: @stroopwafel26 sounds dumb

01:56:47
<transcript>: The X you should learn javascript on your stream. You should.

01:56:52
<transcript>: Okay.

01:56:52
<transcript>: let's let's see

01:56:56
<transcript>: Let's let's see if this works. So now every tab component.

01:56:56
<transcript>: is this even

01:56:59
<transcript>: Is this even rendering? Is it rendering.

01:57:01
stroopwafel26: lol

01:57:03
<transcript>: To do.

01:57:03
<transcript>: table chain

01:57:11
<transcript>: Table chains cool. And then we click this one tab has changed. Oh, look at that. We've got the thing animating and not animating, but we have it going.

01:57:11
<transcript>: over

01:57:16
<transcript>: Over there. I really hate the focus thing. I hate it so much that.

01:57:16
hambonemcglone: Lightning McQueen in a Big Brother reboot

01:57:19
<transcript>: Accessibility be damned. I'm getting rid of it.

01:57:19
<transcript>: sorry

01:57:21
<transcript>: Sorry.

01:57:21
<transcript>: to those

01:57:25
<transcript>: To those who will be triggered by the lack of focus, state.

01:57:36
<transcript>: I just can't do it. Tab has changed. Okay, cool, cool. Arrows work. So I've got some keyboard navigation. That's better than what we had currently on Sam Use. So that feels good.

01:57:47
<transcript>: So now what we actually want to do is show the panel or not show the panel. So we're gonna do this is cool. I like this. We're gonna say Const.

01:57:47
<transcript>: panel

01:57:50
<transcript>: Panel equals document.

01:57:54
<transcript>: Query selector, all, and it's gonna be.

01:58:01
<transcript>: Hash. So it's the ID, and it's gonna be, oh, tabs.

01:58:05
<transcript>: How do I get the name of the tab.

01:58:13
<transcript>: How do I get the name? I guess we have to put it on here. Maybe like we'll use the data.

01:58:15
<transcript>: Data.

01:58:18
<transcript>: Label or something.

01:58:18
<transcript>: maybe

01:58:19
<transcript>: Maybe.

01:58:22
konni: @dinisskizee Yeah, but I already got so less time for streaming atm, that I wouldn't want to split it up to even more different type of content :)

01:58:25
<transcript>: Oh, nope, nope, nope, not that data. Is this what I should do.

01:58:28
<transcript>: Label equals.

01:58:28
<transcript>: tab dot

01:58:30
<transcript>: Tab Dot label.

01:58:30
<transcript>: is that what i

01:58:32
<transcript>: Is that what I should do.

01:58:32
<transcript>: and then here i can

01:58:33
mecoupz: reminds me of the old jquery days having to work with queryselector

01:58:33
zxshan: Just went for my first run in a while, whilst listening to the stream @adamdotdev

01:58:34
<transcript>: And then here, I can say.

01:58:47
<transcript>: Uff, or run CX.

01:58:47
zxshan: Hate how any stamina you build up evaporates after a few weeks when you stop

01:58:55
zxshan: The stream gave good company though!

01:58:59
dinisskizee: @Konni SeemsGood

01:58:59
siennaxxxxx: what does the ...tab ?

01:59:00
<transcript>: What's it like running with me in the background? I feel like that would not be that motivating hate Hi, any Santa. May you build up evaporates after a few weeks? Yes, so true. Takes so long to build up good workout habits and then shatter them in hours.

01:59:02
zxshan: It’s like a podcast

01:59:06
<transcript>: It takes days? But I do I lose all of my my in shapedness.

01:59:06
<transcript>: so

01:59:08
<transcript>: So the tab.

01:59:08
<transcript>: what does

01:59:12
<transcript>: What does the dot dot dot tab? So that's the spreading the tab.

01:59:16
<transcript>: We're just spreading the tab object, all the properties onto the tab.

01:59:19
stiefbroerikzitvast: ...legs

01:59:20
<transcript>: So if I want to get the data from the tab.

01:59:23
zxshan: Focus on you conversating with chat and I forget all about the distance

01:59:24
<transcript>: I would say Tab, data set or something.

01:59:28
<transcript>: Oh, can I just do that data label? No, that's from the text.

01:59:28
<transcript>: data

01:59:29
<transcript>: Data.

01:59:32
<transcript>: What is it? Data set.

01:59:36
<transcript>: Or do I have to do something else? Tab? What.

01:59:42
<transcript>: Someone someone wanna remind me maybe if I maybe copy a little bit.

01:59:42
<transcript>: get

01:59:43
<transcript>: Get.

01:59:47
<transcript>: Data label value.

01:59:51
<transcript>: Give it to me.

01:59:54
<transcript>: Ots. Yeah.

02:00:03
<transcript>: Get attribute. Is that how it works? No, I don't want that, though. I want the data set. It's like a. It's a whole thing, right.

02:00:06
<transcript>: Let's just assume I got it though.

02:00:06
<transcript>: label

02:00:10
<transcript>: Label is gonna be the ID. Thank you so much. Follow.

02:00:12
<transcript>: Mgr.

02:00:22
<transcript>: Yeah. Mgr focus on Uconversating with Chat and I forget about all about the distance. Oh, that's nice. Step. Rows here.

02:00:28
thdxr: dataset

02:00:35
<transcript>: So that's not the way I want to get the label. I want to get it. Yeah. Data set. Why is it not strongly Typed.

02:00:35
<transcript>: javascript

02:00:36
<transcript>: Javascript.

02:00:41
<transcript>: Gets property from data set of elements.

02:00:43
<transcript>: Like there's something I'm missing here.

02:00:48
<transcript>: Accessing values.

02:00:50
thdxr: because it's an element not htmlelement

02:00:51
<transcript>: Data set.

02:00:51
<transcript>: and then

02:00:57
thdxr: in the callback

02:00:57
<transcript>: And then camel case like that it's element, not html element. What's that mean.

02:01:03
<transcript>: In the callback. Oh, get the call back value like this.

02:01:08
<transcript>: Then I can do.

02:01:10
thdxr: e.currentTarget

02:01:12
<transcript>: E dot.

02:01:15
<transcript>: Data.

02:01:15
<transcript>: set

02:01:18
<transcript>: Set. No E dot. Target. Sorry.

02:01:20
<transcript>: Dot data set.

02:01:20
<transcript>: no

02:01:23
<transcript>: No, you're not current target.

02:01:26
<transcript>: Target data set.

02:01:27
thdxr: there u go

02:01:28
<transcript>: No.

02:01:31
<transcript>: Label.

02:01:36
<transcript>: Like that that should work.

02:01:39
<transcript>: Why is it not work, though.

02:01:39
thdxr: the issue is tab is an element

02:01:43
thdxr: not an htmlelement

02:01:46
<transcript>: How many data set designs this on type event target.

02:01:50
<transcript>: Tab is an element.

02:01:52
<transcript>: So should I just do this.

02:02:00
<transcript>: Input equals E dot current target.

02:02:02
thdxr: I hate this situation I usually end up casting maybe there's a better option

02:02:03
<transcript>: As.

02:02:03
<transcript>: html

02:02:06
<transcript>: Html input Yes.

02:02:08
<transcript>: Oh no.

02:02:10
<transcript>: This happens.

02:02:16
<transcript>: Html. Html input lmt because I know that's what it is, right.

02:02:18
<transcript>: I just cast it.

02:02:28
<transcript>: Input data set.

02:02:30
<transcript>: Label.

02:02:32
<transcript>: And see that.

02:02:37
mgr1217mik: Hello,everyone

02:02:40
<transcript>: I hate the situation. I usually end up cashing. Maybe there's a better option. Okay. Yeah, that's what I'm doing. I'm just gonna cast it.

02:02:40
<transcript>: hello m

02:02:47
<transcript>: Hello, mdr. Welcome, welcome, welcome. I guess that's not your first time in chat, but welcome back to chat.

02:02:56
<transcript>: Panel. So there's our panel, we're getting the panel. And then we're saying, Panel, dot, class.

02:03:00
<transcript>: Panel Dot class.

02:03:03
<transcript>: Add. Can I do that.

02:03:04
andreaslorozco: hello all, happy friday!

02:03:07
<transcript>: Add block.

02:03:11
<transcript>: That's not how you out of class, is it.

<transcript>: no

02:03:31
<transcript>: No.

02:03:34
stroopwafel26: the weekend is almost here!

02:03:35
<transcript>: There's showed only be one of them. I'm just gonna assume there's one of them.

02:03:37
<transcript>: It's such bad code.

02:03:37
<transcript>: now

02:03:39
stroopwafel26: what are your plans

02:03:40
<transcript>: Now Panel class.

02:03:41

02:03:54
<transcript>: we make

02:03:56
stroopwafel26: also did you have a nice day wednesday @adamdotdev?

02:03:59
<transcript>: We make waffles on Sunday. That is literally my only playing this weekend.

02:04:05
<transcript>: Why was the top of mind? Because I love waffles with peanut butter and Maple syrup. Could we see the result also.

02:04:08
<transcript>: Yes. You mean this.

02:04:08
<transcript>: here we

02:04:10
<transcript>: Here we go so.

02:04:10
<transcript>: team

02:04:13
<transcript>: Team stats, playerstaps. It's not working.

02:04:13
<transcript>: because

02:04:15
<transcript>: Because I'm not.

02:04:15
<transcript>: removing

02:04:15
thdxr: I have to work all weekend to make up for all the time I spent on twitch

02:04:17
<transcript>: Removing.

02:04:22
<transcript>: Let's see, I gotta remove? I've got add hidden? So okay, we gotta go back to our.

02:04:30
<transcript>: Interesting. Now this means I have to add.

02:04:30
<transcript>: i hate this

02:04:34
<transcript>: I hate this so much since I'd have to add the hidden.

02:04:36
<transcript>: On each of these.

02:04:42
<transcript>: I guess I could make a Tab panel component.

02:04:44
<transcript>: Maybe I should do that.

02:04:47
<transcript>: A Tab Panel component.

02:04:51
stroopwafel26: @thdxr i don't think there's that many hours in a weekend

02:04:52
<transcript>: Maybe let's see if this works.

02:04:55
<transcript>: And then we'll do that.

02:05:01
<transcript>: Let's do that. So there both hidden to start.

02:05:07
<transcript>: I guess that one shouldn't be in the start because it's the first tab. This feels so. Janky.

02:05:09
<transcript>: Add block.

02:05:09
<transcript>: and then

02:05:11
<transcript>: And then remove.

02:05:14
<transcript>: Remove, hidden or something.

02:05:22
<transcript>: Okay. So if it's selected oh, wait, wait. If it changed.

02:05:24
<transcript>: That means.

02:05:26
<transcript>: Will it also trigger.

02:05:31
<transcript>: Changes away from being so let's see input.

02:05:33
<transcript>: Checked.

02:05:37
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay. So we have this checked.

02:05:40
<transcript>: We can base things off of that.

02:05:43
<transcript>: So we say if.

02:05:43
<transcript>: if

02:05:45
7ohnnie: How would you do a component that has styling but you want to be able to add styling additional styling through class prop, kinda like tailwind merge

02:05:47
<transcript>: If input checked.

02:05:50
<transcript>: What just happened.

02:05:55
<transcript>: Just write a little dust, he said. What could go wrong? He said.

02:05:59
<transcript>: Oh, I'm gonna write an L statement back.

02:06:06
<transcript>: What would you do next.

02:06:06
thdxr: NOOOO

02:06:10
<transcript>: What would you do? No.

02:06:19
devagrawal09: what's your beef with else statements?

02:06:20
<transcript>: Did you have a nice Wednesday? I did stroop. It was a great win. Thank you for asking. I have to work all weekend to make up for all the time I sent out Twitch.

02:06:22
<transcript>: It's funny.

02:06:24
<transcript>: That's pretty funny.

02:06:31
<transcript>: Dax says no else statement. Or you're a bad programmer. And I believe him so.

02:06:36
<transcript>: This doesn't work, but I think it's because.

02:06:38
<transcript>: Why do I think it's because.

02:06:45
<transcript>: I need to refresh.

02:06:46
rambo247: toggling a class would prob be better for this?

02:06:49
juliusdotdev: Hey Adam, whats up?

02:06:52
mecoupz: alright everyone i have to go and pick up wifey and kid. have a nice stream, see you next week

02:06:53
debtlessnut: what do you use instead of if/else statement? Switch cases and ternary operators?

02:06:56
<transcript>: We're gonna refresh the page.

02:06:56
<transcript>: no

02:06:58
<transcript>: No still doesn't work.

02:07:10
<transcript>: How would you do a component that has styling, but you want to be able to add styling. Additional styling through class prop. Kind of like tailwind merge. Oh, yeah, yeah, no, I'll show you how to do that.

02:07:12
devagrawal09: @DebtlessNut go full OOP and polymorphism

02:07:16
<transcript>: Johnny. Here's how I do that. I'm doing it up here. I think I'm doing it right here. Yeah, yeah. So right here.

02:07:19
<transcript>: My prior.

02:07:19
<transcript>: if you

02:07:26
<transcript>: If you see here by proxy spins HTML attributes Div so you can pass any attributes of a Div, right.

02:07:26
<transcript>: and then

02:07:27
<transcript>: And then.

02:07:29
<transcript>: Where am I.

02:07:31
mgr1217mik: l’m korean.

02:07:35
<transcript>: Here we have class list and then I can pass in.

02:07:35
<transcript>: any special

02:07:43
<transcript>: Any special classes I want here, but then also extend it with the class prop that was passed in. So that's how I do that.

02:07:50
7ohnnie: Sick thanks so much

02:07:50
<transcript>: Julius, welcome to Chat. What's up? Not much. We're just trying to figure out this tab component. Still.

02:08:04
<transcript>: Oof. We're going on, like day three or something toggling a class. Would probably be better for this. Yeah, I think that's is that what I'm doing? All right, everyone, I have to go see me. Coupes, pick up wifi and kid have an ice cream. We'll see you next week. I'll be back on Monday.

02:08:12
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Debtless nut. What do you use instead of if else statements, switch cases and turnari operator operators. I don't know. Dax. What do we use.

02:08:12
<transcript>: what

02:08:15
<transcript>: What do we do? Polymorphism.

02:08:18
<transcript>: What do we do.

02:08:25
thdxr: just do whatever you have to do to not use an else

02:08:27
<transcript>: Hello mgr is Korean and it actually shows the Korean characters that's cool on my screen.

02:08:28
rambo247: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMTokenList/toggle

02:08:31
<transcript>: Just do whatever you have to do.

02:08:31
<transcript>: not

02:08:34
<transcript>: Not to use an else interesting.

02:08:37
<transcript>: Feels a little. Okay.

02:08:37
<transcript>: okay

02:08:38
<transcript>: Okay.

02:08:38
<transcript>: well

02:08:41
<transcript>: Well, the way I would do that is I would say.

02:08:47
rambo247: make thdxr happy

02:08:48
<transcript>: I would say return, I guess.

02:08:55
<transcript>: I guess that's better. I don't know. Is that better? I don't know. Make dax happy. That's what we're going for.

02:08:55
andreaslorozco: another if with the previous conditional reversed? haha

02:08:58
<transcript>: There's a toggle.

02:08:58
<transcript>: you can

02:09:00
<transcript>: You can toggle something.

02:09:03
<transcript>: I learned something about jobscript today. Here we go.

02:09:03
<transcript>: here we go what is

02:09:06
<transcript>: Here we go what is toggle do.

02:09:12
<transcript>: Toggle the Toggle method of the dom token list interface. Removes an existing token from the list.

02:09:12
<transcript>: so how

02:09:16
<transcript>: So how do you use this on classes toggling a class on click. Well, here you go.

02:09:17
debtlessnut: lol me too - had no idea about the toggle() method

02:09:18
<transcript>: Toggle.

02:09:23
<transcript>: Classes toggle C.

02:09:25
<transcript>: Span, text message.

02:09:25
<transcript>: see

02:09:26
<transcript>: See.

02:09:29
hambonemcglone: I think this is just a Dax prank to slow other devs down

02:09:36
<transcript>: So if I do toggle C it'll just take it off. If it's there it'll add it. If it's not.

02:09:38
<transcript>: Is that what toggle does.

02:09:40
<transcript>: Is how that works.

02:09:40
<transcript>: so

02:09:42
beardage: yup

02:09:43
<transcript>: So class list toggle.

02:09:46
madlep: Hey again. Been a while since I caught an adamdotdev stream. Are you and juliusdotdev related? LUL

02:09:47
<transcript>: Class list.

02:09:47
<transcript>: toggle

02:09:51
<transcript>: Toggle toggle today I learned of an amazing thing.

02:09:56
<transcript>: In JavaScript that I did not know about. So we want to toggle hidden.

02:09:56
<transcript>: probably

02:09:58
<transcript>: Probably right.

02:10:00
beardage: one of those post-jquery niceities

02:10:06
<transcript>: So in any case we want to toggle it I guess.

02:10:06
aj_stuyvenberg: march madness and stat muse are like chefKiss.gif

02:10:06
stroopwafel26: hey @madlep

02:10:08
<transcript>: That right.

02:10:10
<transcript>: All right.

02:10:16
<transcript>: Mad Lip in a while. Yeah, I haven't streamed for a while.

02:10:16
<transcript>: you and julius i'd never

02:10:20
<transcript>: You and julius, I'd never laid it. No. Oh, we have the Dev ending.

02:10:31
<transcript>: Another if with the previous conditional reverse so we didn't have to do anything to get rid of the else because it turns out we didn't need it.

02:10:34
<transcript>: Oh, AJ March madness? That's right.

02:10:34
<transcript>: stat mus

02:10:35
<transcript>: Stat. Muse.

02:10:39
<transcript>: Let's see. Does this work? Now.

02:10:39
<transcript>: i don't think it

02:10:41
<transcript>: I don't think it's gonna work because.

02:10:47
<transcript>: Why is this not gonna work? So if we let's just output console log.

02:10:49
debtlessnut: @DebtlessNut Thanks for the answer! Are if/else statements poor performance, or just trying to use more appropriate uses instead of using 'else'?

02:10:52
<transcript>: Input.

02:10:55
<transcript>: We'll log the label. Okay.

02:11:04
<transcript>: The data set labels on the wrong spot.

02:11:04
<transcript>: i think

02:11:06
<transcript>: I think that's I think that's the wrong spot.

02:11:08
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:11:13
<transcript>: I don't know if I made sense just now, but it made sense to me hang on.

02:11:13
<transcript>: uncought

02:11:16
<transcript>: Uncought cannot read properties of undefined yeah, Yeah.

02:11:16
<transcript>: so pan

02:11:22
thdxr: @andreaslorozco that is actually better

02:11:23
<transcript>: So panel. This is. This is wrong. The data set is not on the input. It's on the inputs. Parent.

02:11:31
kryotoboi: Greetings humons and bots !

02:11:34
<transcript>: What is on the input. Let's just look at tab. Let's look at what is on the input. We've got an ID, which is tab, and then the props ID. I don't know how to find that.

02:11:34
<transcript>: we

02:11:37
<transcript>: We have tab a name.

02:11:38
<transcript>: Class.

02:11:40
juliusdotdev: @madlep No we're not haha, just coincidence

02:11:42
<transcript>: How do I identify this input.

02:11:45
<transcript>: How do I identify it.

02:11:49
<transcript>: Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:11:49
<transcript>: i just need to do this

02:11:51
<transcript>: I just need to do this. I'm sorry.

02:11:54
<transcript>: Astro, props.

02:11:54
<transcript>: i just need to do this

02:12:00
kryotoboi: What would this channel be called if it was run by AI ?

02:12:02
<transcript>: I just need to do this because I'm not spreading that. Oh, but I don't want to override the ID. I guess I need to do this up here.

02:12:05
<transcript>: And we override the ID. Here.

02:12:05
<transcript>: so check it

02:12:10
<transcript>: So check it out. That's the problem. That's a problem. That's the problem.

02:12:19
stroopwafel26: @adamdotdev wanted to tell you i now have my firstname dot dev as well, it just redirects to my github

02:12:19
<transcript>: Why is this not working? Now.

02:12:23
<transcript>: Team Stats Playerstapps Team stats.

02:12:34
<transcript>: Greeting, greetings, Humans and bots Hello, cryo.

02:12:41
dillimus: using toggle assumes correct initial state of the system

02:12:42
kryotoboi: Adam[bot]dev

02:12:43
<transcript>: What would this channel be called if it was run by AI? Great question for Chat, GBD.

02:12:43
<transcript>: i want to tell you

02:12:50
<transcript>: I want to tell you I now have my first name, dev, as well. Just redirect my github. Great idea. Stroop.

02:12:52
marshallrich: Could you not oneline it with  menuButton.classList.toggle('is-active');  This would just add and remove the class 'is-active' but replace with your class   Sorry couldn't keep up :D

02:12:54
<transcript>: That's a great idea and just put a read me on your GitHub.

02:12:54
<transcript>: cheskis

02:12:56
<transcript>: Cheskis.

02:12:56
<transcript>: dillomus

02:12:58
<transcript>: Dillomus. Welcome to Chat. Toggle.

02:13:02
<transcript>: Assumes correct initial state. Yeah, that's true.

02:13:02
<transcript>: i also don't

02:13:05
<transcript>: I also don't think it's not. It's not doing anything now.

02:13:11
<transcript>: I guess my on change. Let's see, what did I do? I broke the tab component is what I did.

02:13:13
standardrobot: o/ back

02:13:13
<transcript>: Adam Botnev.

02:13:22
stroopwafel26: yeah i have a readme on my github profile that outputs the latest posts from my blog and some stats, it gets updated through a github action

02:13:31
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Marshall. Could you not one line it with menu button class lists toggle is active. This would just add and remove the class. It's active but replace with your class. Sorry couldn't keep up. Maybe. I think right now my issue is different. I gotta get let's see.

02:13:31
<transcript>: ta

02:13:43
<transcript>: Tack on change somehow I've broken oh, something happened. Think of the follows, Dillamus and John techie and Standard Robot. Thank you for the three months.

02:13:43
<transcript>: sub

02:13:45
<transcript>: Sub thank you so much.

02:13:47
<transcript>: Look at that. Three months.

<transcript>: Feels good.

02:13:52
<transcript>: Shock? Snur thanks for that follow.

02:13:56
<transcript>: So this broke, this broke everything.

02:14:00
<transcript>: Maybe I'll do this. Props. Data.

02:14:00
<transcript>: set

02:14:01
<transcript>: Set.

02:14:02
kryotoboi: Why are we not using pug as much ?

02:14:05
<transcript>: That's not. I can't do that.

02:14:08
<transcript>: But could I do data set.

02:14:08
<transcript>: no data

02:14:09
<transcript>: No data.

02:14:11
<transcript>: Layer.

02:14:13
andreaslorozco: @thdxr oh interesting! I'm not used to that

02:14:14
<transcript>: Equals.

02:14:17
<transcript>: Astro.

02:14:17
<transcript>: astroprop

02:14:20
<transcript>: Astroprop Label. I could do this.

02:14:20
<transcript>: yeah i

02:14:22
<transcript>: Yeah. I could just do that. That's easy.

02:14:29
<transcript>: And I can come back here and we can remove data label from here.

02:14:31
<transcript>: Okay.

02:14:31
<transcript>: feels good

02:14:33
<transcript>: Feels good. That was the solution.

02:14:37
<transcript>: I don't know if it's gonna work, but that's at least needed to happen.

02:14:48
<transcript>: Something's happening. Can I repopt your zone? Define reading class lists so it's still not finding. Let's see, let's move our logging here.

02:14:48
<transcript>: what does

02:14:51
<transcript>: What does Label come back as.

02:14:52
thdxr: Adam you've been way too productive lately

02:15:01
<transcript>: Undefined. Okay, so something's wrong here. What is wrong? Input. Let's. Log input, console. Log. Input.

02:15:07
<transcript>: So Div class.

02:15:07
<transcript>: oh

02:15:09
<transcript>: Oh, wait.

02:15:09
<transcript>: the

<transcript>: The Div.

02:15:15
<transcript>: Why is the Div the thing that's being. Wait, what.

02:15:19
<transcript>: I've been way too productive lately. Uhoh.

02:15:20

02:15:39
devagrawal09: @Kryotoboi because we're in 2023

02:15:41
<transcript>: So the tab.

02:15:46
<transcript>: Oh, because. No, I don't know. Why is that.

02:15:59
<transcript>: Why's? It the divin, not the. I mean, I guess it's fine. I can move this up here. I just don't know why that's the case. It doesn't make sense to me. I wanted to make sense to me.

02:16:08
<transcript>: Team stats, players. That so that's working now. But can I write Freed Properties? So it's not finding.

02:16:12
<transcript>: Stop by an element with that ID.

02:16:17
<transcript>: Okay. We're getting closer.

02:16:21
<transcript>: We have the correct label and now we just need to find.

02:16:23
dillimus: Pug templating is the python of html

02:16:27
<transcript>: Why is it not finding the ID.

02:16:31
<transcript>: To see if this has the right ID.

02:16:36
<transcript>: Team stats? Yeah. So why can I not do.

02:16:36
<transcript>: document

02:16:40
<transcript>: Document, queries selector, all.

02:16:43
<transcript>: Team stats.

02:16:47
<transcript>: Empty.

02:16:49
<transcript>: An empty note list.

02:16:49
<transcript>: can i have spaces

02:16:50
<transcript>: Can I have spaces.

02:16:55
<transcript>: Do you not have spaces.

02:16:58
<transcript>: From.

02:16:58
<transcript>: maybe

02:17:01
<transcript>: Maybe it shouldn't be all for one thing.

02:17:04
<transcript>: Query selector.

02:17:07
<transcript>: No. Oh, why can't I can I not have spaces.

02:17:18
<transcript>: At the problems that from hug templating is the python of html. Oh, I see, I see, never heard of it.

02:17:20
kryotoboi: How come everything I keep in my To Learn folder becomes obsolete by the time I get around to learning  it  NotLikeThis

02:17:22
<transcript>: And I've done a lot of python, just never heard of it.

02:17:25
debtlessnut: yeah i'd go kebab case here for js, IDK

02:17:27
<transcript>: How come everything I keep in mind to learn folder becomes obsolete. By the time I get around to learning it.

02:17:28
debtlessnut: try it no spaces

02:17:33
<transcript>: Kababk case.

02:17:33
<transcript>: i would

02:17:36
<transcript>: I would also go kabab case.

02:17:36
<transcript>: try it

02:17:38
<transcript>: Try it no spaces.

02:17:40
thdxr: why do people reply to my tweets being 100% wrong

02:17:41
rebeldecibel: how can you work without armrests? :D

02:17:41
<transcript>: So if I change the ID.

02:17:48
heroictashcan: You will have to do something like [id="id with space"] in the query selector

02:17:49
<transcript>: And then there it is. Okay. So I need to do the I guess.

02:17:55
stroopwafel26: @thdxr because twitter

02:17:56
<transcript>: Id equals ID with space in the query selector. Oh, oh, okay.

02:17:56
<transcript>: because i'd

02:18:04
<transcript>: Because I'd like to just keep it simple and not like do string manipulation on it. You know, query selector, and then I. D. Equals.

02:18:08
<transcript>: Team stats like that. Maybe.

02:18:11
<transcript>: Not quite. Oh, I'm missing.

02:18:18
<transcript>: So I just need to do like this. Maybe.

02:18:24
andreaslorozco: change the id back, it still has a hyphen

02:18:27
<transcript>: No.

02:18:30
debtlessnut: no outer quotes?

02:18:32
<transcript>: Am I writing that right? Id equals in the query selector.

02:18:35
<transcript>: No outer quotes.

02:18:35
<transcript>: oh really

02:18:38
<transcript>: Oh, really? I thought it was like a string.

02:18:46
debtlessnut: just brackets and quote "Team Stats" inside the bracket

02:19:00
<transcript>: Ide equals. And then ID with space. First of all, welcome to Chat Hero. I guess that wasn't first of all, was it? How can you work without armrests? You know, I've gotten used to this chair. I really like it. Actually, it's very comfortable. Feel like it keeps on posture. Better.

02:19:04
<transcript>: Change the ID back Oh.

02:19:06
kryotoboi: Yes we don't need jQuery LUL

02:19:08
devagrawal09: no yeah it has to be string, you need outer quotes

02:19:10
<transcript>: Sorry. You have to catch things like that for me. I'm sorry. Sorry about it.

02:19:18
<transcript>: So now let's see now. I probably do need to put the string.

02:19:18

<transcript>: And then.

02:20:32
<transcript>: like

02:20:37
<transcript>: Like that delicate. Okay, panel. And then toggle hidden.

02:20:40
<transcript>: What do we think is gonna work.

02:20:43
<transcript>: It works.

02:20:43
<transcript>: no

02:20:45
<transcript>: No, it does not work.

02:20:48
<transcript>: It does not work.

02:20:48
<transcript>: there's some kind of weird

02:20:53
<transcript>: There's some kind of weird logic here. So does it fire for every let's see.

02:20:56
<transcript>: On Change console, log.

02:20:56
<transcript>: label

02:20:57
glamshatterskull: sometimes dev things... prolly more dev things in the future... i work as a cloud engineer irl

02:20:58
<transcript>: Label.

02:21:01
<transcript>: Oh no.

02:21:11
<transcript>: Okay. I'm gonna see. Does it fire for both of them when there's a change? No, it just fires to the one that was okay. So that's a problem. My logic is wrong.

02:21:11
<transcript>: we've got

02:21:14
<transcript>: We've got to actually go through every tab.

02:21:14
<transcript>: when one of

02:21:18
<transcript>: When one of them changes, right? We've got a toggle it for every tab.

02:21:23
<transcript>: That sounds bad. No, I think I should explicitly set. I don't know if toggle works here.

heroictashcan: I just make myself cry there

02:23:52

02:23:52
<transcript>: my

02:23:55
<transcript>: My knowledge of the Classroom scale of five is one out of five.

02:24:01
dillimus: In your initial tab query selector, can you just cast to HTMLElement list there?

02:24:04
<transcript>: Oh, font just remembered I'm spreading the love for zed mono daunt font of the new zid. What is that.

02:24:05
<transcript>: Z.

02:24:12
ttbishop: the guy that built atom

02:24:15
stroopwafel26: isn't zed by the creators of atom?

02:24:17
ttbishop: making a new IDE

02:24:19
stroopwafel26: yeah

02:24:19
<transcript>: Oh, in your initial tab query selector, can you just cast the html element? I don't think so. Dillamus. I don't think so. That'd be really cool. Let's try it. Matt jigger. I mean, for that matter, I could just do here. I could just say cops.

02:24:23
dnbull: zed IDE is another IDE that will not kill vscode Kappa

02:24:27
<transcript>: Yeah. Like I just do what it's saying right there. Right. If that works, then cool. But I don't think it's going to.

02:24:31
kryotoboi: Any love for brackets editor ?

02:24:33
ttbishop: @dnbull but the font is nice :D

02:24:36
<transcript>: Have to do this for each time I'm just gonna copy it all like make it reusable here in a minute if I have to.

02:24:36
<transcript>: pan

02:24:37
<transcript>: Panel.

02:24:42
<transcript>: Let's just try this.

02:24:46
dnbull: i font with times new roman dont at me

02:24:46
<transcript>: I'll just try it like this.

02:24:48
<transcript>: I don't know.

02:24:51
<transcript>: And see if the toggle thing works.

02:24:54
<transcript>: It does.

02:24:54
<transcript>: you can just toggle

02:24:57
<transcript>: You can just toggle them does that work if there's three tabs.

02:25:00
<transcript>: Yeah. I guess it does.

02:25:02
<transcript>: No.

02:25:02
<transcript>: no it doesn't

02:25:02
dnbull: @ttbishop jokes aside - gonna check it out

02:25:05
<transcript>: No, it doesn't. It doesn't work unless there's only two tabs.

02:25:08
stroopwafel26: @dnbull vscode is gud

02:25:09
<transcript>: Right. Because if there's three tabs, you'd be toggling two of them to visible.

02:25:17
<transcript>: Yeah, it doesn't work if there's more than two types we can't toggle we'll change that. Okay. There's a lot of chatter right now. I still haven't heard from Glenn.

02:25:17
<transcript>: and i

02:25:21
glamshatterskull: multi-cloud, depending on what the client wants. i was working at a datacenter company building environments for clients, migrating them in making sure everything works the way they want it then handing them off to support and doing it again

02:25:23
<transcript>: And I am so curious. Glam. Your cloud engineer. That is literally my job.

02:25:27
<transcript>: I am you're in a dnd show as well. Oh, that sounds fun.

02:25:47
<transcript>: In the future, you work as a cloud engineer. Glam, talk to me. Hit me. Oh, there we go. Multicloud, depending on what the client wants. I was working at a data center, company, building environments for clients, migrating them and making sure everything works the way they want it, then handing them off to support and doing again. That's awesome. Glam. I mostly work in AWS.

02:25:52
<transcript>: So does dax. You'll see him th? Dxr and see him in my chat.

02:25:58
<transcript>: Yeah, we're AWS folk but yeah, we're cloud people cloud engineers.

02:25:58
<transcript>: cloud

02:26:00
<transcript>: Cloud developers.

02:26:02
<transcript>: What we do.

02:26:04
glamshatterskull: yee mostly aws and vmwares

02:26:07
<transcript>: Okay. So this works because there's exactly two tabs.

02:26:12
glamshatterskull: too much vmwares

02:26:12
stroopwafel26: AWS cloud folk checking in! 15 years and counting

02:26:14
<transcript>: Mostly AWS and vmware is cool glam good to know I would love to watch you streams sometime.

02:26:24
<transcript>: Too much vmwarees AWS cloud folk checking in 15 years encounting yes droops. Also from AWS land we are all members of the AWS community.

02:26:24
<transcript>: which is

02:26:26
dillimus: Like on the first line of your script tag you should be able to cast the querySelectorAll and all future references to tab will be typed properly 😉

02:26:34
<transcript>: Which is a thriving community on Twitter. Not to be confused with the aws community on Twitter, which is not thriving. It's full of bots and I'm sorry I manage it and it's my fault.

02:26:34
<transcript>: like on the

02:26:40
<transcript>: Like on the first line of your script tag, you should be able to cast the query selector. All and all future references have Oh.

02:26:40
<transcript>: that makes sense

02:26:44
<transcript>: That makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. So right here. Just do as.

02:26:46
<transcript>: Html.

02:26:48
heroictashcan: So much cloud. I feel out of place BibleThump

02:26:51
<transcript>: I don't even actually think they're input elements. I think they're divs, but I'm just gonna do that.

02:26:51
<transcript>: like that

02:26:53
<transcript>: Like that. Okay.

02:26:53
ttbishop: I build my own cloud cause renting baremetal is cheaper by a factor of 10

02:26:57
<transcript>: And then here. I don't have to do that.

02:27:00
<transcript>: And just say tab.

02:27:04
<transcript>: Okay. So we're not actually going to.

02:27:08
<transcript>: Not actually going to.

02:27:08
<transcript>: set them

02:27:12
<transcript>: Set them up. We're not gonna toggle anymore. We're not gonna do this.

02:27:13

02:27:15
<transcript>: We're going to instead.

02:27:21

<transcript>: I'm one of those that lets the birdsite to find a happy home on a mastodon instance.

02:27:35
devagrawal09: sst?

02:27:37
ptrhvns: Do you publish your Vim/Neovim config?

<transcript>: Welcome to Chat ptr. Did you publish your vim new of Mconconfig? Yes, thank you, stroop. I shouldn't have even read it. So does this work? Let's just see if this actually works. It's a casting this way. Works.

02:28:17
<transcript>: and

02:28:23
<transcript>: And if it does okay, it's backwards because this initial state was wrong.

<transcript>: Oh, no, no. Tab is what I named this variable. So.

02:28:52

dnbull: @dnbull thanks!

02:31:10
<transcript>: What? Dax? On syntax FM. We got to listen to this. I don't want to listen to it. I would spend, like, how long is the episode, dax? How long would we spend if I just played it here on stream.

02:31:14
<transcript>: Feel like that's probably not the best move. I do want to listen to it so badly, though.

02:31:14
<transcript>: i promise you

02:31:19
<transcript>: I promise you, 15 lines of code. And I delivered, probably like 20.

<transcript>: Catch the air. If slug changes, we change that. And then if not blog return null. Okay, so like I've written enough react. I don't see the confusing part, but also if you don't write reaction, that's probably confusing.

02:43:48
<transcript>: So I always do my best and decide to educate myself on what use vector is.

02:43:48
<transcript>: i always

02:43:49
<transcript>: I always do my best.

02:43:53
zxshan: Seems to do with more complexity on his use case then the framework itself?

02:44:05
<transcript>: Sorry I'm not giving this guy the best without search for Reactus effect ended up on that saw page as long as the single page Bible HTML version also signs a warning. Tried the new React documentation. Okay, so these clearly not like in the react space.

02:44:05
<transcript>: if

02:44:09
kryotoboi: True story: Today I had a meeting with the Director of engineering and I he was talking about what's new in react. I told him about astro and almost said Adam is re-writing satsmuse in Astro

02:44:11
<transcript>: If he's just these comments like he's not a React developer, which is fine.

02:44:11
<transcript>: but like

02:44:13
thdxr: Adam talk about the react docs starter thing

02:44:15
<transcript>: But like, Are you gonna teach me react if I pay you $400? Is that what you're telling me.

02:44:17
<transcript>: Interactive courses.

02:44:17
<transcript>: i don't see

02:44:20
<transcript>: I don't see other faces here. I see his face.

02:44:31
<transcript>: I'm gonna pay, I'm gonna pay this man $400. I'm gonna do it, and he's gonna teach me react. And if he doesn't, I'm gonna be very upset. I don't know. Complain about on the Internet. Request a custom curriculum.

02:44:32
thdxr: he's learning how to teach react rn

02:44:32
<transcript>: Oh.

02:44:32
<transcript>: oh

02:44:35
<transcript>: Oh, Chad Stack has prime tried this.

02:44:35
imshootex: HeyGuys

02:44:40
<transcript>: You can assume it's a fetch that returns blog. Okay.

02:44:40
<transcript>: if you read

02:44:41
trivenge: LOL

02:44:44
<transcript>: If you read its thread, he's correct. The userfic documentation is stupid. Oh, it probably is.

02:45:00
<transcript>: You know, o'reilly. Okay, first, I'm chat. Welcome to Jack Tech. Savvy Trapy publicly posts that he doesn't understand basic rack principles. I mean, that's fine. Not everybody does react like, I don't expect my larvae, friends, the people who use laravel. I don't expect them to be like.

02:45:09
thdxr: I expect my larabar friends to know react

02:45:11
<transcript>: Up to speed on React, and I would I would expect them to post that they're confused about React. If they saw this code, I would expect that that all makes sense to me. What doesn't make sense is if he's selling.

02:45:11
<transcript>: courses

02:45:13
<transcript>: Courses.

02:45:14
trivenge: !yhoutube

02:45:15
techsavvytravvy: of course, but also don't sell courses then lol

02:45:15
<transcript>: And he's teaching react.

02:45:15
<transcript>: i don't

02:45:16
trivenge: !youtube

02:45:17
<transcript>: I don't understand.

02:45:23
<transcript>: Felt postgres Versaille git pod. Okay.

02:45:26
techsavvytravvy: Cheer100

02:45:30
<transcript>: So he teaches more swell. It looks like that's why he defaulted it to Celt.

02:45:30
<transcript>: let's see

02:45:30
dnbull: unpopular opinion: they should not get rid of CRA especially for "new" people. How are you gonna recommend a whole framework to someone new to react. I'm probably alone on this hill though LUL

02:45:34
<transcript>: Let's see, let's see, let's see? Free code camp. Oh, so he's a free co camp instructor.

02:45:40
trivenge: I'm gonna need to see another youtube video here soon mr adam

02:45:42
trivenge: SeemsGood

02:45:47
<transcript>: I want to thank whoever just did something. You cheered. Tech Savvy Travis cheered. 100 bits. Thank you so much for those 100 bits. Also. Dirt up. Oh, I already saw that. Well, thank you for the following. I'm gonna say it again.

02:45:50
<transcript>: I wonder if linked.

02:45:50
<transcript>: if i link

02:46:10
<transcript>: If I linked am hatzu if anim would buy it 1600 R keyboard link it please. I'm not gonna buy it right now, but I'm curious what a $1600 keyboard would be like if you restart. Okay, you can assume it's a fetch seems to do with my complexity on his use case than the framework itself. True story. Today I had a meeting with the Director of Engineering. I was talking about what's new to react. I told him.

02:46:10
<transcript>: about astro

02:46:11
natedunn: what keycap set is that? 8008?

02:46:13
<transcript>: About Astro and almost said Adam is rewriting statues in Astro.

02:46:13
<transcript>: you

02:46:16
<transcript>: You almost said that. That's funny.

02:46:16
<transcript>: adam talk about

02:46:20
<transcript>: Adam, talk about the React doc starter thing. He's like learning how to teach React right now.

02:46:20
<transcript>: what

02:46:22
<transcript>: What.

02:46:25
zxshan: @dnbull Agree. React should standalone on an island. It's like Ruby defaulting Rails as the standard.

02:46:26
<transcript>: Talk about the React docs Starter thing.

02:46:32
<transcript>: Oh, he this is what he's doing? He's trying to learn enough react to teach it in his courses.

02:46:44
<transcript>: It's the Youth effect. Reference page. Note back. Sure. Why not? You might not need an effect. I kid you not affects her. An escape hatch from the React paradigm. Haha. Okay. Is this a hidden camera show.

02:46:44
<transcript>: second

02:46:47
<transcript>: Second sentence. I'm still not kidding. They let you step outside. React.

02:46:49
<transcript>: reactive

02:46:51
<transcript>: Reactive white. A headache.

02:46:52
<transcript>: Okay.

02:46:52
<transcript>: so what's the

02:46:55
<transcript>: So what's the reaction to this.

02:46:55
<transcript>: am i

02:46:56
<transcript>: Am I.

02:46:56
<transcript>: in the major

02:46:58
<transcript>: In the majority.

02:47:00
<transcript>: Getting corrected and those people are gonna recurring.

02:47:03
<transcript>: Once unclear everything is.

02:47:03
<transcript>: statement

02:47:04
<transcript>: Statement.

02:47:08
<transcript>: He's learning how to teach, react.

02:47:08
<transcript>: i took

02:47:10
dnbull: @dnbull CRA is perfectly fine for concepts. I highly doubt "new devs" trying to build production react apps LUL

02:47:12
<transcript>: I took my lara Bar friends to no react. Laravel.

02:47:13
techsavvytravvy: gotta know enough react to grift

02:47:23
<transcript>: I'm popular opinion they should not get rid of cra, especially for new people. How are you gonna recommend a whole framework to someone new to react? I'm probably alone on this solo.

02:47:23
<transcript>: i don't have stronger

02:47:30
<transcript>: I don't have stronger opinions. I'm gonna need to see another YouTube video here soon. I know, I know, triv. I'm so behind.

02:47:30
<transcript>: what

02:47:34
<transcript>: What keycap set is that? Nate? Done. Ask the one I'm using.

02:47:34
<transcript>: i'm using

02:47:36
zxshan: I think the frameworks built on top of React have grown so popular and solve so many problems it's putting the core team out of solving the same problems and they've chosen to rather adopt the frameworks built on top and support them than solve the same problems.

02:47:36
<transcript>: I'm using the dracula keycaps.

02:47:36
<transcript>: and the

02:47:39
<transcript>: And the music is gonna have to go.

02:47:41
<transcript>: Okay.

02:47:51
<transcript>: Seriously fine for concepts. You gotta know enough reactor grift. Okay, so this person, I'm just a little upset. I'm just a little upset. I saw something on Twitter, and I'm a little upset.

02:47:55
natedunn: @dnbull create react app is dead tho. no way to recommend that.

02:47:58
<transcript>: I'm a little upset that I could pay him. He's bought tail in ui and put up a course page and he will let me.

02:47:58
<transcript>: buy

02:48:04
<transcript>: Buy a react course from him and he literally doesn't know react.

02:48:04
<transcript>: like

02:48:09
zxshan: Was that spicy enough for you @adamdotdev? Glad I could help

02:48:12
natedunn: ah the infamous Dracula set LUL

02:48:14
thdxr: vite vite vite

02:48:14
<transcript>: Like he's confused by us effect, which I get it we're all confused by users back. But like he's upset about Use effect, which he's five years later on being upset about user. Am I right.

02:48:14
<transcript>: like

02:48:21
<transcript>: Like, I'm gonna pay this guy $400, and I'm gonna just film the process of him teaching me react. What is this interactive course.

02:48:21
<transcript>: tell me more

02:48:24
<transcript>: Tell me more about what this course is gonna look like.

02:48:24
<transcript>: react

02:48:27
<transcript>: React new modules added frequently.

02:48:33
<transcript>: So I guess it's not letting me choose oh, there goes java. I just couldn't choose next JS for some reason.

02:48:37
<transcript>: No js and.

02:48:37
<transcript>: planet scale

02:48:41
<transcript>: Planet Scale Learn, Now, Teach me.

02:48:41
<transcript>: in this

02:48:46
thdxr: ah the common pattern of react tailwind and java

02:48:50
kryotoboi: I wanna run this scam too. I learn anything programming to teach it to you

02:48:51
<transcript>: In this course, you'll learn how to develop a full stack to do application. This goes well beyond your regular to do a tutorial is we are going to look at persisting to do items in a database, and also learn how to deploy the web app.

02:48:51
<transcript>: teach me mike

02:49:10
<transcript>: Teach me, Mike. Teach me. Oh, it's not your Bible. Okay, maybe I'm just. I'm a little ahead here. I'm getting on him. And he's my done making this. Okay? Keep making your thing, Mike. Just please don't try to teach anyone react. Ever. Ever. Because you don't know, react. And I hate grifters. I hate it so much. It makes me so mad. Okay, this was spicy. Now. Thank you, Zia.

02:49:10
<transcript>: that was fantastic

02:49:12
<transcript>: That was fantastic.

02:49:16
natedunn: @thdxr name that stack

02:49:17
<transcript>: React Hill, and in Java.

02:49:21
<transcript>: What would that stack be? That would be the.

02:49:25
<transcript>: Rtj there's nothing I can make out of that.

02:49:30
thdxr: JRT stack

02:49:30
dnbull: ive never used solidjs or svelte but i can tell they are way better than react

02:49:32
<transcript>: Can't make anything out of that. I want to run this scam, too. I learned anything. Programming to teach it to you. Exactly. Beginner's mind. Right.

02:49:32
<transcript>: if

02:49:33
thdxr: JRT jrt

02:49:36
moussx_: That stack would be nightmare material that's all

02:49:42
<transcript>: If you're the Jr tack, if you're new to learning it, that's when it's best to teach it because it's fresh. You still see it with fresh eyes, right.

02:49:42
zxshan: @thdxr I work in this stack at work no joke :'(((((

dnbull: yall underestimate humanity people are dumb LUL

02:50:58
zxshan: They always are lololol

02:51:02
<transcript>: Really, really brilliantly written. Yeah, I would say it's just a little too unrealistic it's just a little too over the top.

02:51:07
<transcript>: Y'all underestimate Humanity. People are dumb. I believe that.

02:51:07
zxshan: ^ Brilliantly written that is

02:51:10
<transcript>: Okay. Are we done with Twitter.

02:51:15
<transcript>: Are we done with Twitter? Time? Is it back to coding time.

02:51:17

<transcript>: There was something I had to take on.

02:51:21
<transcript>: and i have

02:51:29
<transcript>: the use effect

02:51:30
dnbull: i guess what im trying to say is that if its real its really not surprising

02:51:32
devagrawal09: "not real" and "brilliantly written" descries most of r/aita

02:51:35

hambonemcglone: TAKE ALERT

02:51:40
zxshan: Yep ^

02:51:43
<transcript>: And I know something about react. I've written it for, like, eight years, so I'm terrible at it. But I know some things. And I'll be right back.

02:51:56
natedunn: are you terrible enough to write a course though?

02:52:01
natedunn: cause some people are LUL

<transcript>: Maybe not. Yeah. Maybe there are people that.

02:57:27

<transcript>: The user effect knocks describing it as a way to escape the react way of doing things.

02:57:54
<transcript>: i think it's

02:57:56
<transcript>: I think it's interesting because.

02:57:56
<transcript>: i don't know if

02:58:05
devagrawal09: other than the fact that they are like a direct competitor

02:58:17
<transcript>: I don't know if I've ever written anything and react where I didn't need to use effect and I don't use it the wrong way. I know the wrong ways. I know you don't use it when you're just computing state. I know you don't use it when you're whatever. Like I know I get it. But like every single app I've written I've had to use use effect. And if that's like escaping the.

02:58:17
<transcript>: react

02:58:22
<transcript>: React paradigm, then, is React not capable of building a real application by itself.

02:58:30
<transcript>: Like using the react paradigm of like the unidirectional. All that nonsense is that model just not appropriate for building apps.

02:58:30
<transcript>: if you have

02:58:37
<transcript>: If you have to escape it constantly. You know what I'm saying? I'm not trying to be super spicy here. It's just like maybe this whole.

02:58:48
<transcript>: Obsession over, like the React way is like, I don't know, just nerd stuff and who cares and just use solid. I don't know.

02:58:48
<transcript>: i know

02:58:54
<transcript>: I know. Daxy reads with that. Saw Jazz. Stop thinking of, like, react, react, brain. Okay.

02:59:01
devagrawal09: "just nerd stuff" - nerd

02:59:01
<transcript>: That's as far as I'm gonna go with that take because it's actually technical and I'm not smart enough to have technical takes. I only have, like.

02:59:01
thdxr: I think they mean you're supposed to use a library that's using useEffect so you don't use it

02:59:09
thdxr: but yeah I don't get it either

02:59:10
<transcript>: Takes that are responses to other people's tastes. I think they mean you're supposed to use a library that's using these effects. So you don't use it. Is that what they mean? Oh, maybe.

02:59:10
<transcript>: other than

02:59:13
<transcript>: Other than the fact that they are like a direct competitor.

02:59:18
<transcript>: Oh, Ant. Oh, you guys are talking about Ant.

02:59:23

<transcript>: Did I squash my beef on the video call? What was the video? What was the video call.

02:59:42
<transcript>: More of a push towards riding your own hooks, I think. Oh, interesting. But you're using Use effect in your hooks, right.

02:59:42
<transcript>: like

02:59:43
thdxr: @devagrawal09 idk if they're a direct competitor, totally different approaches

02:59:50
thdxr: it's a 1000x harder to build your own island

02:59:54
<transcript>: Like if you need to fetch data and maybe just use React query or whatever. I guess maybe that's the answer. But if you need to like fetch something data when a component is rendered or whatever.

03:00:01
<transcript>: Like even if you write your own custom post, you're still using Use Effect, so you're still escaping the React paradigm.

03:00:01
<transcript>: brand

03:00:05
<transcript>: Brandon no. Brand name boredom. Think of that follow.

03:00:11
<transcript>: Okay it's 1000 times harder to build your own Island.

03:00:17
<transcript>: I think you guys time on Aunt. Here we go. We're getting back to.

03:00:17
<transcript>: back

03:00:19
<transcript>: Back to the work.

03:00:19
<transcript>: the

03:00:22
<transcript>: The works that gets me paid.

03:00:22
<transcript>: team stats

03:00:23
<transcript>: Team stats.

03:00:29
<transcript>: Playersteps we make a tab component and it actually works.

03:00:32
<transcript>: Actually does.

03:00:34
<transcript>: So that feels good.

03:00:41
nartc: Nice!

03:00:43
<transcript>: Let's use this tab component to great effect. Let's finish this page by putting the player stats in that would feel so good. Can I get that done? I have an hour.

03:00:43
<transcript>: oh

03:00:45
<transcript>: Oh, it feels good.

03:00:45
<transcript>: nart

03:00:48
<transcript>: Nart, C? Welcome to chat.

03:00:51
devagrawal09: @thdxr different approaches, similar use cases

03:00:52
<transcript>: Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome? We've got a tab control? And it's.

03:00:55
<transcript>: Ken thinks that follow.

03:01:04
<transcript>: Let's see. There was something I wanted to clean up in here.

03:01:08
cowfacedude99: that counts for some confetti LUL

03:01:12
<transcript>: For each. We do all that and we do that. That's all fine. There's something I want to clean up, though.

03:01:15
<transcript>: I don't like the casting that's going on here, but it works.

03:01:20
grasp5533: I have to use terraform at my current job, and I hate it

03:01:23
<transcript>: Oh, so the thing that sucks about this.

03:01:27
kirso_: Curious, if you'd start from scratch today knowing vanilla JS. Would you still start with react? Not for job purposes but just shipping stuff?

03:01:30
<transcript>: Is like right here. We have to put the hidden class on our second tab.

03:01:30
<transcript>: that sucks

03:01:31
<transcript>: That sucks.

03:01:31
<transcript>: i

03:01:34
<transcript>: I wish so we could do tab panel.

03:01:34
<transcript>: we could

03:01:44
<transcript>: We could do tab panel, and that would solve that, like Creator wrapper that has a label. So it's not the ID. Yeah. Yeah. Let's do that. Let's do tab panels.

03:01:53
<transcript>: Curious if you'd start from scratch today knowing vanilla js? Would you still start with React? Not for job purposes, but just shipping stuff. Kirsto, welcome to chat.

03:02:04
turki_9999999: @adamdotdev are you going to learn competitiveprogrraming?

03:02:05
<transcript>: You know what I start with react it's so hard in retrospect or like to take the context of my career out of it and be like.

03:02:05
<transcript>: if i

03:02:07
<transcript>: If I started today.

03:02:10
<transcript>: But I would say, like.

03:02:13
<transcript>: If I were just getting started in the industry.

03:02:28
<transcript>: I would probably still end up using racked because it's where so much of the like learning is it's where so many people are teaching it? And I don't know, maybe we're following it far enough along the curve of other frameworks, like solids or whatever that I would have gotten into one of those. But.

03:02:28
<transcript>: or you

03:02:37
kirso_: Yep

03:02:39
cowfacedude99: @turki_9999999 we kind of went nowhere around the time of advent of code. So.......

03:02:42
<transcript>: Or you're not saying if I had you're just saying, like, What's my recommendation to somebody new? Is that what you're saying? If you'd start from scratch today knowing vanilla js, would you still start with your act just for shipping stuff? Yeah. Okay. So my advice to other people.

03:02:42
<transcript>: i

03:02:47
fragaverage: I'd still choose NextJS just for "shipping things" not job related

03:02:54
dnbull: I'd say if it were for job reasons. React is the way to go but for shipping? Learn Solid or svelte

03:02:59
<transcript>: I would say, honestly, learn solid. I just I think like, you could avoid a lot of learning the react way and just like, build stuff. And I think your brain will be better for it. I don't know. I'm not a person that uses solid. I just know enough about the differences and enough about.

03:02:59
<transcript>: what i don't

03:03:01
<transcript>: What I don't like about react.

03:03:04
<transcript>: And people I respect.

03:03:04
<transcript>: like

03:03:08
<transcript>: Like Ryan carneado. Use solid. That's gonna say dax. But then I thought it'd be funny if I just.

03:03:08
<transcript>: my

03:03:11
<transcript>: Mysteriegel thanks so much that follow.

03:03:11
<transcript>: yeah

03:03:15
<transcript>: Yeah. Now I would say I would not start with react.

03:03:15
<transcript>: it may

03:03:20
devagrawal09: i'd say react or vue, if you care more about shipping stuff you want something that has a better ecosystem

03:03:30
<transcript>: It may be sad when I see people like, on Twitter that are new and they're so excited and they're getting into this stuff and they learn, react. And then they're like, going down the Redux path. And I'm like, oh, my, just the amount of stuff you just had to learn to just, like, ship something, anything.

03:03:30
<transcript>: i just think

03:03:39
majksec: javascript WutFace

03:03:42
devagrawal09: more specifically next or nuxt

03:03:43
<transcript>: I just think that's too much. Personally I think I would not go that route if you learn react okay, but don't go down the Redux path, please, just anything else. Oryx. Orca thank you so much for the follow.

03:03:52
tropichana: I’m still learning vanilla js so this is helpful advice thanks

03:03:55
fitzsimons_dev: If I'd never shipped anything before, I'd actually try Astro to ship something. Because it's really vanilla and you can learn stuff like event handlers etc...

03:03:55
<transcript>: Magic. Welcome to Chat. Do I say React review? If you care more about shipping stuff, you want something that has a better ecosystem. So dev is the ecosystem of React, though. Like.

03:03:55
<transcript>: i feel

03:03:58
mattmancodes: Redux was such a bad time

03:03:59
<transcript>: I feel like there's probably everything you need.

03:04:06
kryotoboi: There also exists Angular in the world. NotLikeThis

03:04:12
devagrawal09: by ecosystem i mean tooling, training, hiring

03:04:19
<transcript>: To build solid, solid apps today in like, the ecosystems big enough because the React ecosystem so big that it's just like, you're still running into tutorials or classbased components. And like, well, don't use that anymore. You should use hooks like, it's almost so big that I wonder if it becomes a disadvantage. I don't know. I don't. I'm not good at this stuff. This is not my forte.

03:04:23
cowfacedude99: I am living in it @mattmancodes LUL

03:04:24
<transcript>: Like giving career advice to early devs but.

03:04:24
<transcript>: i don't know

03:04:26
<transcript>: I don't know. I feel like.

03:04:26
<transcript>: i would

03:04:29
<transcript>: I would still not start with react personally.

03:04:33
turki_9999999: still react cant handle docx file view

03:04:36
<transcript>: Tooling training. Hiring. That makes sense. Yeah. There's a lot more jobs. That's a good call. I'm someone that lives in a bubble where I've never had a real job.

03:04:36
<transcript>: and i've never had

03:04:44
<transcript>: And I've never had to deal with, like, actual hiring practices. So you probably don't want to listen to me for, like, career advice. Just probably a good idea.

03:04:45
wennstrom: Learning redux for work atm...

03:04:47
mattmancodes: Thoughts and prayers @cowfacedude99

03:04:47
<transcript>: Okay. What am I doing? I am.

03:04:47
<transcript>: i'm gonna make

03:04:53
<transcript>: I'm gonna make a tab control or tab panel. That's funny. I had one. I deleted it.

03:04:53
<transcript>: tab

03:04:58
zxshan: I think we've definitely lost sight of things with React becoming so popular. I was asked to build a feature in vanilla JS for a twitter interview last year and it was refreshing and actually very easy.

03:04:58
<transcript>: Tab panel. Kebab case. Sam. Here we are.

03:05:02
<transcript>: Tab, We're gonna just yank all this.

03:05:08
mattmancodes: @Wennstrom My condolences

03:05:12
zxshan: It's easier to learn actual DOM methods than a framework itself.

03:05:21
lifelessirl: what code editor is that?

03:05:26
<transcript>: Learning Redux for work at the moment at Wind storm. I mean, if you're if your project if you're Republic you're coming into already uses Redux, then you kind of have to learn Redux. I just think like a new dev. Dev, do you agree with me there? Dev? Like if you're coming in.

03:05:26
<transcript>: and your first

03:05:26
ptrhvns: How long have you been developing statmuse?

03:05:30
dnbull: anyone else hates when Adam puts himself down? This dude Adam is legit, smart and has solid advice.

03:05:32
<transcript>: And your first thing is learning, react, and redux, doesn't that just seem like way too much mental overhead.

03:05:32
<transcript>: am i alone

03:05:33
<transcript>: Am I alone on that.

03:05:34
cowfacedude99: neovim @LifelessIRL

03:05:39
ttbishop: I'm glad I learned redux, I started learning frontend without actually knowing much programming or CS. I knew angular before I knew javascript

03:05:43
<transcript>: Life list. It is new of him. How long have you been developing statmes? So we started setting these eight years ago.

03:05:43
<transcript>: which

03:05:46
<transcript>: Which kind of blows my mind? Eight years ago. It was a long time.

03:05:57
<transcript>: We've not rewritten the Web part for six years. I mean, it's been what it is today for a long time. Now. What am I doing? This is the Tab panel.

03:05:57
<transcript>: it's gonna be very

03:05:59
<transcript>: It's gonna be very simple.

03:05:59
ttbishop: understanding redux taught me a lot, looking back on it it's such a simple pattern

03:06:03
<transcript>: It's gonna just be a slap.

03:06:03
lifelessirl: the companies i applied for dont even let u join if u dont know react and redux lol

03:06:04
beardage: I just rejected an applicant for using redux in their take-home (was only supposed to be a 2 hr assignment)

03:06:05
<transcript>: Like that.

03:06:13
<transcript>: I'm glad I learned redux. I started learning front end without actually knowing much programming or cs. I knew angular before I knew JavaScript.

03:06:18
devagrawal09: you;re right, redux is probably not relevant anymore, you can put that time into learning nextjs and be way more productive

03:06:20
<transcript>: It's easier to actually learn actual dom methods than a framework itself.

03:06:25
ptrhvns: Wow, 8. Cool. How many LOC is statmuse at this point?

03:06:29
dslegends: @dnbull agreed.  Paths are different, experience and sharing experience and opinions are supper valuable for those of us thinking thru options.

03:06:32
kryotoboi: Back in the day new devs used to ask should I learn Js or Jquery LUL

03:06:34
readytodie94: Hello @adamdotdev 👋 In your opinion, is it still relevant to start learning frontend web dev in 2023, especially with the arrival of AI and its models that already look very promising?

03:06:36
andreaslorozco: I've somehow managed to work in react for 5 years already without ever having to learn Redux...

03:06:40
zxshan: Anyone remember MEAN stack? lul

03:06:42
<transcript>: Dev. You're right. Read X is probably not relevant anymore. You can put that time into learning next js. Yeah, next year. There you go. That's what you should start with. Be way more productive. Start with next year. That's just a good like has everything you need. You'll build apps that are good.

03:06:51
<transcript>: Wow. Cool. How many lines of code assembly is at this point? Someone asked me out there today. I don't even know how to find out.

03:06:51
<transcript>: we've

03:06:59
<transcript>: We've got like two dozen repos, and I don't even know where I would start if I were trying to count up all the lines of code that make up the Sat muse product.

03:06:59
<transcript>: i don't

03:07:01
<transcript>: I don't even know.

03:07:01
<transcript>: someone

03:07:04
<transcript>: Someone tell me if there's like a plugin or something I can use it'll. Just tell me.

03:07:04
<transcript>: welcome to chat

03:07:05
mattmancodes: @readytodie94 Yes it is worth it. AI isn't that good.

03:07:09
devagrawal09: but then again this is not the best time to start nextjs, no idea what the new app router will end up looking like once it's stabilized

03:07:11
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat ds Legends pads are different experiences. Sharing experience and opinions are super valuable for those of us thinking through options.

03:07:21
<transcript>: The inval. I missed the message that you're referring to anyone else hate when Anna puts itself down. This dude, Adam is legit smart and has solid advice.

03:07:21
<transcript>: look at

03:07:23
<transcript>: Look at that. The unbouffing me up.

03:07:23
<transcript>: my favorite

03:07:28
<transcript>: My favorite react friend. I mean, sorry, Miami, friends.

03:07:28
<transcript>: my favorite

03:07:30
<transcript>: My favorite friend in Miami, the embol.

03:07:31
cowfacedude99: IMO nuxt is pretty nice right now.

03:07:37
nartc: @zxshan I do lol one of my most viewed videos on Youtube 5-6 years ago

03:07:38
<transcript>: Beardage. I just rejected an applicant for using redux in their takehome. Was only supposed to be a twohour assignment.

03:07:45
dnbull: LOL "react friend" I dont even know what useState is LUL (jk)

03:07:48
<transcript>: Company has I. P. Four. Don't even let you join if you don't know reactor read X. Wow, okay, I just am so out of touch with the hiring scene.

03:07:54
<transcript>: That. I do not know these things. I did not know. Redux was like, Hot on the hiring scene.

03:07:58
<transcript>: Ready to die first time Chat. Welcome to chat.

03:08:00
<transcript>: Is it.

03:08:00
<transcript>: still

03:08:01
zxshan: @Nartc Was all the rave back in the day ahaha

03:08:09
<transcript>: Still relevant to start learning frontend web Dev in 2023, especially with the arrival of AI and its models that already look very promising. Yes. Still relevant.

03:08:09
<transcript>: still very relevant

03:08:10
dnbull: I've dodged redux as well mostly because people told me to stay away from it?

03:08:10
<transcript>: Still very relevant.

03:08:12
zxshan: Can imagine everyone in tech was watching your vid to learn it

03:08:15
<transcript>: Just learn to use the tools to learn the things you want to learn.

03:08:15
<transcript>: fernando

03:08:16
trivenge: what is your mode eighty keyboard config, in terms of plate variants (copper, aluminum, pom, fr4, carbon fiber), and plate foam?

03:08:20
<transcript>: Fernando. Thank you for that prime sub. I see you. Fernando.

03:08:20
<transcript>: i see

03:08:31
<transcript>: I see you. Thank you so much. Ready to die. I think you'll follow also. Neils and Fernando. Thank you for follows. Or if Oryx I miss that one. Thank you for your follow.

03:08:31
<transcript>: okay

03:08:35
kirso_: MEARN? Anyone remember Rails stack? 🧌

03:08:39
<transcript>: Okay. I somehow managed to work in React for five years without ever having to learn redux. Yeah, I think redux is just pretty dated at this point.

03:08:39
<transcript>: anyone else

03:08:39
beardage: my engineering lead described redux in an applicant's submission as a code smell

03:08:41
ttbishop: it's like asking if you should wipe after taking a crap since you'll be taking another crap tomorrow

03:08:41
kryotoboi: Hiring scene around react is weird.  They are asking for experience in redux with ReduxToolkit

03:08:44
fernandojunior20: no problem my friend, great work!

03:08:45
<transcript>: Anyone else? Remember, Mean Stack? Yes. I think we built status with the Mean Stack originally.

03:08:45
<transcript>: it

03:08:52
<transcript>: It was definitely mongo. It was definitely for the application side, not for our sports reference reference data and stuff.

03:09:02
<transcript>: Then again, this is not the best time to start next year. No idea what the new app writer will end up looking like. What's? It save life. That's my thing. I'm gonna tell you guys. Okay, I'm coming back over here.

03:09:02
midobbexmachina: I miss Ruby on Rails

03:09:04
<transcript>: I'm gonna.

03:09:04
fitzsimons_dev: Modern Redux is pretty slick tbh

03:09:06
<transcript>: This might be super dumb.

03:09:06
<transcript>: and i

03:09:15
<transcript>: And I want you to tell me all, like, actually tell me, be honest with me. If you think this is dumb, not don't make it, then I won't. But I want to make.

03:09:15
<transcript>: a

03:09:24
mattmancodes: Redux is still out there, usually in companies afraid of change. Probably took most of them this long to even begin using it.

03:09:26
<transcript>: A like parody video of Next js 14. Have I even announced anything for Next js 14? Thank you so much for that. Sub. Can can hold a.

03:09:31
andreaslorozco: do eeet!

03:09:42
<transcript>: Have they announced anything? I don't even know if, like, next Year's 14 is like on the radar, but I want to do a parody video that's like, Next Year's 14, I'm gonna do it super high production because they do really like high production stuff, right? Like the versaille Team. They get out the good cameras.

03:09:42
<transcript>: they do stuff

03:09:48
devagrawal09: YES

03:09:49
<transcript>: They do stuff like very professionally. So I'm like a super glossy parody that is like Super.

03:09:49
<transcript>: high

03:09:55
<transcript>: Highly produced. Okay. And I'm gonna make up all these features. So I thought of things like.

03:10:01
kirso_: @midobbexmachina Never been a better time to go back :)

03:10:10
andreaslorozco: yeah your twitch aesthetic matches vercel's a bit

03:10:15
dnbull: NextJS is over the top for their production just to say we implementing fonts Kappa

03:10:15
<transcript>: What are some of my ideas? So there's gonna be a new site director instead of the app directory. You can now use a new site directory and it defaults to use server instead of no. Doesn't. Sorry. It defaults to use client. So like you have to opt in the server, use server in the site directory and use client in the app directory. It's just come backward. So that'd be fun. And then I thought.

03:10:15
<transcript>: a new

03:10:19
<transcript>: A new router that's an advanced typescript router.

03:10:22
<transcript>: Sorry I'm making myself laugh.

03:10:23
thdxr: wow nextjs jokes I don't get!

03:10:26
zxshan: PLEASE DO IT OF REMIX INSTEAD.

03:10:26
beardage: built in chatgpt interface built in to add features

03:10:27
midobbexmachina: @midobbexmachina no jobs in my part of town

03:10:29
trivenge: lol

03:10:29
devagrawal09: new directory, new router, new build tool,

03:10:33
mattmancodes: The day Adam gets blocked by Vercel

03:10:37
<transcript>: That's probably a good sign. I should do it if I think it's funny. No one will think it's funny, but I thought like a router that abandoned the filebased routing and like it's advanced typescript nonsense. Then try and make it sound very real. Like an April fool's thing. Maybe. I don't know.

03:10:46
schererja: @midobbexmachina That's what remote jobs are for :D

03:10:49
<transcript>: But like you're doing all these crazy generic types to do your routing thought that'd be fun. Something like there's next font. And there's next image. Like a next slash favorcon.

03:10:52
nartc: Vercel’s marketing game is top-notch in the web space right now

03:10:53
devagrawal09: @mattmancodes LUL

03:10:55
treasonist: new super-turbo-pack

03:10:58
zxshan: Especially considering Remix were pooping on all pre-existing methods of routing as their promo for their own framework

03:11:00
andreaslorozco: don't let your dreams be dreams @adamdotdev

03:11:00
<transcript>: Something with turbo. I got to do, like a turbo thing. Maybe. Just like they acquired roam tools, and they're gonna finish turbo pack.

03:11:01
nartc: none can generate hype like they do

03:11:01
thdxr: adam these things don't sound like jokes....they just sound real to me

03:11:06
devagrawal09: snailpack

03:11:07
dnbull: I'm still wondering how the app router fits here.

03:11:07
ttbishop: I don't get it :|

03:11:10
<transcript>: I've got all kinds of ideas. I'm gonna make it. They don't sound like jokes to send, like, real to you. They might be too real. That might be the problem.

03:11:14
<transcript>: Still wondering how the app router fits there or fits here.

03:11:20
<transcript>: I'm trying to read your stuff now. After just cracking myself up for five minutes, I need to actually reach out.

03:11:20
<transcript>: please do

03:11:22
<transcript>: Please do it remix instead.

03:11:22
<transcript>: interesting

03:11:23
<transcript>: Interesting.

03:11:24
dnbull: Do it, Adam!

03:11:29
<transcript>: Wow. Next. Yes. So if I don't get sorry? Yeah. You don't know next. Shit. Ax.

03:11:29
<transcript>: somebody said

03:11:36
<transcript>: Somebody said, do it okay. Dev says yes. In Caps. Never been a better time to go back. Talk about rails.

03:11:40
devagrawal09: no remix people are way too sensitive

03:11:45
<transcript>: Your twitch aesthetic matches versailles a bit. Oh, I could do a versaille bit. I could totally make this feel like a versaille video if I wanted to.

03:11:50
<transcript>: The problem is it'll it'll be me because I've got to deliver the lines.

03:12:01
fitzsimons_dev: Remix doesn't seem to have a great sense of humor. Vercel would laugh it off

03:12:04
<transcript>: And like, I don't work for myself. So that's a good giveaway. But I thought, like, I could maybe do cutscenes and show some of the people as well. But I want to like, put on a nice shirt and like saying, in my kitchen and hold my hands like this, just like gear Mo and talk about next. Jess.

03:12:04
<transcript>: fourteen

03:12:05
<transcript>: 14.

03:12:05
<transcript>: and how

03:12:08
mattmancodes: @devagrawal09 SO TRUE. Just stick with Next

03:12:11
<transcript>: And how we're unlocking the web or whatever, making it faster. I don't know. It's gonna be good.

03:12:11
<transcript>: next

03:12:15
dnbull: Yeah, Remix people will start deactivating their accounts and go to facebook instead, maybe

03:12:15
<transcript>: Next ship is over the top of their production just to say we implementing fonts.

03:12:20
<transcript>: Please do it of remix I don't know anything about remix.

03:12:20
<transcript>: thank you

03:12:23
<transcript>: Thank you gab, for the follow.

03:12:23
<transcript>: and

03:12:26
<transcript>: And luch, thank you for your follow.

03:12:26
<transcript>: builtin

03:12:29
<transcript>: Builtin chat gpt interface builtin to add features.

03:12:31
<transcript>: That could be a good one.

03:12:31
devagrawal09: @fitzsimons_dev yeah everyone made fun of vercel ripping off apple after nextjsconf and they were mostly fine with it i think

03:12:37
<transcript>: New directory, New router, New Build tool yes, Yes.

03:12:37
<transcript>: that's it

03:12:39
dnbull: Remix people are boring you dont wanna mess with that "serious" community

03:12:41
<transcript>: That's it next year's. 14. Right? I'm totally gonna do this.

03:12:41
<transcript>: today

03:12:50
trivenge: I would put that on the back burner but tweak the script for that video, release when it is more relevant when they come out with the announcement or something

03:12:54
<transcript>: Today Adam gets blocked by yourself. Hopefully I do it well enough that it's funny and everyone knows a joke. And versailles not upset. I don't want to upset them, so I want to have some good fun with it. That's all for salesman, for sales. Marketing. Game is talk notch in the web space right now.

03:13:01
okufa_f: hey adam, do you play fantasy sports?

03:13:01
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat treasonous. New super turbo Pack ooh. There we go.

03:13:01
<transcript>: super

03:13:03
trivenge: as you want to leverage that hype a bit

03:13:13
<transcript>: Super especially consider remakes. We're pooping on all preexisting methods of routing as their promo for their own framework. Yeah, I feel like it's too easy to poke at remix because of the way they actually Act.

03:13:13
<transcript>: online

03:13:14
<transcript>: Online.

03:13:14
<transcript>: i don't really

03:13:21
thdxr: I think vercel's marketing style is out dated

03:13:21
<transcript>: I don't really want to poke at that because I'll just genuinely be like calling them out, and I think they get enough of that.

03:13:24
beardage: "we've purchased vite, and are sundowning that project in favor of turbopack"

03:13:27
devagrawal09: also introducing integration with react database components, this will be rendered in postgres stored procedures

03:13:28
thdxr: I think Ben with his whiteboard is 100x a better vibe

03:13:28
<transcript>: I think poking it versailles more fun because they're genuinely good at executing and like they make good stuff.

03:13:28
<transcript>: so

03:13:29
ttbishop: OH GOD !!! @adamdotdev  I thought I was the only one

03:13:33
thdxr: vercel feels pretentious a bit

03:13:34
<transcript>: So it's more fun to make fun of them because of the high production quality and like the drama of it.

03:13:34
zxshan: True @adamdotdev

03:13:35
fitzsimons_dev: Yeah. i really like remix but I'm hesitant to use it because they're a little too sensitive.

03:13:35
<transcript>: Okay.

03:13:49
<transcript>: Snail pack. So, dax, you think they sound really to you because you don't use next. But also, I hope they sound a little real so that it seems like a real thing. And you're kind of like, I don't know. Is this that's actually next year, 14, or is this an April for this joke? You know what I mean.

03:13:51
<transcript>: Snail pack.

03:14:00
<transcript>: So wondering how the app router fails here. I don't get it. It's okay. You guys don't get it. I think it's funny. And dev says I should do it. That's good enough for me.

03:14:00
<transcript>: remix doesn't

03:14:03
thdxr: ohhh you want to trick people that makes more sense

03:14:05
thdxr: that's genius

03:14:05
<transcript>: Remix doesn't seem to have a great sense of humor. Versailled would laugh it off. That's what I think. I agree.

03:14:09
<transcript>: Remix people will start deactivating their accounts and go to Facebook instead.

03:14:10
zxshan: I'm glad the sentiment towards Remix / it's creators is the same here, I saw it all from afar and felt this way

03:14:19
mattmancodes: HackerNews complaining because all these features don't exist.

03:14:26
dnbull: NextJS doesn't do a good job at convincing though. Their production quality is top notch but i dont understand the Apple approach.

03:14:26
<transcript>: Remix people are boring. You don't want to mess with that serious community. I would put that on the back burner, but tweak the script for that video release when it's more relevant when they come out with announcement or something. Well, the thing is I want to do it before next year 14 comes out because I want to convince people to actually be next 14. That's the goal.

03:14:26
<transcript>: do i

03:14:30
<transcript>: Do I play fantasy sports? I used to. I used to play fancy football.

03:14:38
<transcript>: I want to leverage that hype a bit for sales marketing. Stylists. Outdated. Yeah. I think the Apple thinks too glossy. Personally, I'm not into it.

03:14:38
<transcript>: we

03:14:41
<transcript>: We purchased veet and our.

03:14:41
<transcript>: sundown

03:14:51
glamshatterskull: glossy like their displays

03:14:54
<transcript>: Sundowning that project? Oh, so sundowning in favor of turbo pack? Oh, they purchased VAT. Oh, geez, that would cause a stir. Introduce integration with React database components. This will be rendered in postgres stored procedures.

03:15:03
<transcript>: I love that devs on my page right now. He gets what I'm going for here. I think Ben with his whiteboard is 100 times a better vibe. Oh, I agree, actually.

03:15:07
<transcript>: I thought it was the only one.

03:15:07
<transcript>: vers

03:15:15
<transcript>: Versaille feels pretentious yeah, I agree. Too distant. I think they feel too distant. I really like remix, but I'm hesitant to use it because there's a little too sensitive.

03:15:15
<transcript>: you want to trick people

03:15:24
fitzsimons_dev: That one framework made a video with king kong fighting godzilla.... Thats cooler than the apple glossy stuff imo

03:15:29
<transcript>: You want to trick people that make more sense? Yeah. Exactly. I'm glad this intimate toward remix it's Creators is the same here. I saw it all from far away and felt this way. Yeah. They've just they've got a certain persona online hacker news complaining because all these features don't exist. Yeah.

03:15:29
<transcript>: we

03:15:44
devagrawal09: make sure you are using "web standards" but are also monkeypatching the web standards to add your own stuff into it

03:15:44
<transcript>: We got a fool. Some people I want to fool the people who are like, maybe just a little too distant from it and they don't know or I guess it'd be an extra S users that might actually think those could be real features. They're just on the periphery of, like.

03:15:49
<transcript>: I guess that would be a feature, but not really. You know what I mean.

03:15:49
<transcript>: i guess a good

03:15:54
<transcript>: I guess a good parody. You've got to find that line just got like straddle. It.

03:16:00
devagrawal09: okay i think i have issues with vercel

03:16:01
<transcript>: The production quality is topnotch, but I don't understand the Apple approach. Glossy like their displays. Thank you for the follow it.

03:16:01
<transcript>: one

03:16:06
<transcript>: One Framework made a video with King Kong fighting Godzilla.

03:16:06
<transcript>: that was

03:16:08
<transcript>: That was ssd, that was DAX.

03:16:08
<transcript>: make sure

03:16:16
dnbull: @devagrawal09 therapy time? Kappa

03:16:16
<transcript>: Make sure you were using web standards but are also monkey patching the web stairs to add your own stuff into it. So I thought Dev I could even make a website.

03:16:16
<transcript>: could

03:16:18
<transcript>: Could even make like a next GIF.

03:16:18
<transcript>: website

03:16:22
<transcript>: Website launched 14 thing I don't know.

03:16:24
looch94: dude your setup is insane

03:16:25
<transcript>: That might be going too far.

03:16:27
<transcript>: But I'm definitely gonna make a video.

03:16:32
fragaverage: nextjs 14?

03:16:34
fragaverage: wut

03:16:37
kanhaod3v: i appreciate the quality of your stream, congrats, is really amazing, say hi to brazil pls, my name's fernando

03:16:45
devagrawal09: @dnbull maybe

03:16:47
<transcript>: Luch. Dude, your setup is insane. Welcome to Chat. Thank you. Yeah, my setup is insane. Let's go back to the stuff stuff we were doing because I was gonna try and finish this before I'm done streaming and I got a hurry because we don't have much time. Data label don't need that. This is Tab panel. So I want to go back to mba box store and I want to say.

03:16:48
fitzsimons_dev: You could name the mock framework PreviousJS

03:16:52
<transcript>: This is what a team. Okay, so just need to have the ID.

03:16:55
<transcript>: Just needs to have the ID.

03:16:59
<transcript>: Equals astro props.

03:16:59
<transcript>: label

03:16:59
anitrogen: do u work on this stuff off stream too? or is it mostly on stream?

03:17:01
<transcript>: Label and then.

03:17:06
dnbull: Next is not becoming PreviousJs? LUL

03:17:06
<transcript>: What.

03:17:09
dnbull: now*

03:17:18
<transcript>: I just want to pass a label. I guess. No, I guess I should pass it as ID.

03:17:21
<transcript>: Add Panel ID.

03:17:24
<transcript>: Or not.

03:17:25
dnbull: "we're going backwards, we were wrong"

03:17:28
<transcript>: Title I'll do all the title.

03:17:28
<transcript>: like

03:17:28
mattmancodes: @aNitrogen He _sometimes_ works on stream LUL

03:17:32
<transcript>: Like the other component so title.

03:17:35
<transcript>: Title.

03:17:35
<transcript>: and then

03:17:40
coolpantstv: are you guys seeing an issue with the statmuse site and are re-writing it? or is this just to move to a newer framework

03:17:40
<transcript>: And then it doesn't have any of that. It's just gonna be let's see, not input, but Div.

03:17:41
fitzsimons_dev: TurboPack is becoming GruntPack

03:17:46
<transcript>: I just put vid? Am I by? Am I? What's that word? Dyslexic.

03:17:47
devagrawal09: previousJs ditches typescript in favor of Java, which offers stronger typing and better encapsulation

03:17:47
<transcript>: We're gonna do.

03:17:47
<transcript>: astro

03:17:50
<transcript>: Astro, Dot, props.

03:17:50
<transcript>: and then we

03:17:52
<transcript>: And then we have our slot. Perfect.

03:17:54
<transcript>: Perfect.

03:17:58
<transcript>: Is that it though I feel like.

03:18:02
<transcript>: Just passing in an ID. Okay, whatever.

03:18:05
<transcript>: No.

03:18:05
<transcript>: i want to

03:18:09
<transcript>: I want to do G R how do I do no rename is.

03:18:13
<transcript>: Rn no.

03:18:19
<transcript>: Is it it is. I did it. Okay. New name is Tab panel.

03:18:24
<transcript>: Got an import tab panel from.

03:18:27
<transcript>: What.

03:18:31
<transcript>: Oh, I guess that's not okay.

03:18:39
<transcript>: Tab panel type panel type panel? Why is that? Not children.

03:18:39
<transcript>: id

03:18:41
<transcript>: Id. Oh, it's got to be titled.

03:18:44
mattmancodes: @devagrawal09 Enhancing the power of JSP's!

03:18:45
fitzsimons_dev: PreviousJS with GruntPack is perfect for if you don't believe in the cloud and want to buy a bunch of servers and move them into your office

03:18:51
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, yeah? I gotta do the class hidden? So here's how we do this? How do we do this? How do we do it.

03:19:14
<transcript>: I'm trying to catch up I'm scrolling up chat here next s 14 1st time welcome to Jack Can howd I appreciate the quality of your shine Congrats is really amazing. Stay high to Brazil, please Hi Brazil Fernando.

03:19:23
<transcript>: We get a lot of people from Brazil. I've had a lot of people from Brazil in the chat. Welcome, Hello, Brazil. And welcome Fernando.

03:19:27
<transcript>: You could name the mock framework previous JS.

03:19:30
<transcript>: Previous JS.

03:19:41
<transcript>: What? Oh, next previous I gotcha I got, ya know, we're gonna actually make it sound like it's next js like it's next 14, you know.

03:19:55
<transcript>: So let's see a nitrogen. Do you work on this stuff? Offstream tour? Is it mostly on stream? I do work on it. Offstream.

03:19:59
<transcript>: Fatuk and tristan, thank you so much for those follows.

03:20:01
<transcript>: And.

03:20:11
<transcript>: Sometimes works on Stream. Yeah, I get less done on Stream than I do offstream. Probably. Are you guys seeing an issue with the sami site and a rewriting it? Or is this just a move to a newer framework.

03:20:11
<transcript>: there's a lot

03:20:16
<transcript>: There's a lot of factors. I should write it up so that people can just refer to it.

03:20:16
<transcript>: i'll

03:20:18
<transcript>: I'll try and do it really short.

03:20:27
looch94: what do you think of scss?

03:20:33
<transcript>: It's an eight year old code base, and it's a hodgepodge of elixir in Phoenix, and a React Create React app embedded in the middle of it. Half of its server rendered. The other half is client rendered. There's no rhyme or reason. It's the why.

03:20:33
<transcript>: we could have gone

03:20:47
<transcript>: We could have gone all in on elixir Phoenix and just moved it all to the server instead of astro. But we don't have a lot of elixir knowledge, and we don't want to have to find people with the luxur knowledge. We just want typescript. So we went modern. We're rewriting it because we're getting ready to build a bunch of new features. That's the short version.

03:20:47
<transcript>: okay

03:20:49
<transcript>: Okay.

03:20:55
<transcript>: What do you think of scss? I don't think anything about sdss. I don't know much about it.

03:21:04
<transcript>: Sass, I think is what that extension is for. Okay, players ask class students, so I need to handle this. This class state.

03:21:07
<transcript>: I'm sorry? The hidden state.

03:21:07
<transcript>: table

03:21:10
<transcript>: Table no tab. Panel.

03:21:15
<transcript>: I need to handle.

03:21:15
<transcript>: this

03:21:20
<transcript>: This the hidden the initial hidden state. How do I want to do that in the tab panel.

03:21:21
devagrawal09: @looch94 run the other way

03:21:23
<transcript>: Have could.

03:21:23
<transcript>: tabs

03:21:25
<transcript>: Tabs could do it.

03:21:26
<transcript>: Maybe.

03:21:26
<transcript>: if i go

03:21:30
looch94: @devagrawal09 why's that?

03:21:34
<transcript>: If I go to tabs and I say we put a class on the on the root of this. Watch this.

03:21:34
<transcript>: watch this

03:21:35
<transcript>: Watch this.

03:21:35
<transcript>: first

03:21:39
<transcript>: First. Isn't there like a first child or something.

03:21:41
<transcript>: First.

03:21:41
<transcript>: block

03:21:42
<transcript>: Block.

03:21:45
<transcript>: And then.

03:21:45
<transcript>: other

03:21:47
<transcript>: Otherwise.

03:21:50
<transcript>: Otherwise we say hidden. Maybe.

03:21:52
<transcript>: What do we think.

03:21:55
<transcript>: Otherwise we say other children.

03:21:58
<transcript>: Like this.

03:22:01
<transcript>: Hidden.

03:22:06
<transcript>: I guess I need to do the first block after that.

03:22:10
<transcript>: Honestly, I don't know if this is going to work.

03:22:21
<transcript>: I don't know if this is gonna work. Oh, it's actually hiding the tabs? Oh, yeah, yeah? Because it should be should be here? Div.

03:22:23
<transcript>: Oh no.

03:22:28
devagrawal09: scss is essentially added syntax on top of css, i think nowadays you shouldn't be writing css at all, so by extension you shouldn't be writing scss

03:22:30
<transcript>: It should be in here.

03:22:33
<transcript>: Right.

03:22:36
neochromer: @adamdotdev how do you like astro so far?

03:22:42
<transcript>: Team stats. Player stats. Team stats. Players ask. Nope. What did I do wrong.

03:22:45
neochromer: Ive done a project in it and I must say I find it really nice

03:22:46
<transcript>: What did I do wrong? That shouldn't be class. Hidden.

03:22:46
<transcript>: kind of get rid

03:22:49
<transcript>: Kind of get rid of the manual class hidden here.

03:22:54
<transcript>: Adam, do you like, how do you like ashlee? So far? I love it.

03:22:54
<transcript>: i love

03:23:02
<transcript>: I love that show. It's a perfect fit for what we're doing at Sat. Means. So that's probably about why I love it. Okay, let's just look at these.

03:23:04
<transcript>: Thanks so much for the follow.

03:23:06
<transcript>: Extras.

03:23:15
<transcript>: Here's. The div. No.

03:23:15
<transcript>: is that the div

03:23:16
<transcript>: Is that the Div.

03:23:20
<transcript>: No, here's the Div.

03:23:20
<transcript>: so

03:23:25
<transcript>: So it's we're saying all of them are hidden, but then the first one and should be blocked.

03:23:33
<transcript>: So did that work. Display? None. No. The display. None. Is overriding the block.

03:23:33
looch94: @adamdotdev why shouldn't you be writing css at all? what's the alternative?

03:23:36
<transcript>: Could I say.

03:23:42
devagrawal09: tailwindcss

03:23:43
<transcript>: This first work like I think it does is first actually what I was going for.

03:23:48
<transcript>: First.

03:23:48
<transcript>: yeah

03:23:50
iklobato: Hello, what is happening

03:23:52
<transcript>: Yeah. Let's take the first child, right? Yeah. First child.

03:23:52
levidayne: Where are you going to be deploying your Astro app to?

03:23:58
<transcript>: We could do like exclamation. Mark. Does that work in tailwind. Can you do that.

03:24:05
<transcript>: Is this a dumb thing to do? I should not do this.

03:24:05
<transcript>: we should do something

03:24:06
<transcript>: We should do something else.

03:24:10
<transcript>: So if I say they're all hidden by default.

03:24:12
looch94: oops sorry replied wrong person

03:24:16
<transcript>: Then we have to somehow say the one the first one is visible.

03:24:21
kiwifromearth: kiwitime kiwilime

03:24:25
<transcript>: I've done a project in it and I must have found it really nice. Yeah, I'm loving astro. I do love astro. Why shouldn't you be riding css at all? What's the alternative.

03:24:25
<transcript>: what

03:24:30
<transcript>: What? Oh, I think you said oops, sorry, replied romper on person. Nope, no problem.

03:24:38
<transcript>: Hello? What is happening? Aye, Kilobato, welcome to Chat. What is happening is we are rewriting statues.com.

03:24:38
<transcript>: kiw

03:24:41
<transcript>: Kiwi from Earth this year Kiwi time keeping lime.

03:24:41
<transcript>: where are you

03:24:46
<transcript>: Where are you going? To be? Deploying your ashrap to aws, so.

03:24:46
<transcript>: samue's

03:24:53
<transcript>: Samue's already exists on aws, that's where it's hosted, and we're gonna continue doing that. It'll just be hosted by SST.

03:25:00
<transcript>: Creates like an Astro. It has an astrocyte construct. We'll be deploying our Astro site into our aid of discount with that.

03:25:01
thdxr: how do you like aws? should I learn it?

03:25:02
<transcript>: Okay.

03:25:04
mngrmatt: Adam, Dumb question - your Jib setup - is that triggered manually or were you able to connect the app to the steam deck?  Cause thats fucking bad ass.

03:25:06
levidayne: Neat

03:25:07
devagrawal09: why not vercel Kappa

03:25:12
mattmancodes: Azure would have been a shock

03:25:23
<transcript>: How do you like aws? Should I learn it? Yes. X. I would recommend it. The dx is a little a little rough. It's a little rough around the edges. But other than that, you should try sst. It would really help. It would help with your learning of aws. Welcome to Chat. Mngr map. Adam. Dumb question. Your jib.

03:25:23
<transcript>: setup is

03:25:26
thdxr: thanks!

03:25:29
<transcript>: Setup is that triggered manually, or were you able to connect the app to the Stream Deck? Because that's awesome.

03:25:29
<transcript>: sorry my

03:25:34
<transcript>: Sorry, my mom watches a stream so I don't repeat everything I read. I don't read everything I see.

03:25:37
<transcript>: So.

03:25:37
<transcript>: it is

03:25:40
<transcript>: It is just on a loop. My jib is just on a loop.

03:25:40
<transcript>: it just runs

03:25:48
thdxr: your mom can see the chat though can't she

03:25:49
hambonemcglone: Hi Adam's mom

03:25:49
<transcript>: It just runs all the time. And then it just cuts that camera occasionally. That's how that works. It does work with the stream deck. You can connect it. And I've even worked with the sdk before.

03:25:50
thdxr: hi adam's mom

03:25:52
<transcript>: Moses ski, mosa. Key things of that follow.

03:25:52
<transcript>: hi adam's

03:25:56
mngrmatt: amazing. I apologize for the language.

03:25:57
hambonemcglone: @thdxr same hat

03:25:58
devagrawal09: hih momdotdev

03:26:01
<transcript>: Hi, adam's. Mom, if you're here, Mom, Hi. Everyone in Chad is saying Hi. If you're here, you can say Hi back. I give you permissions to speak and chat.

03:26:01
<transcript>: you

03:26:02
thdxr: lolol

03:26:04
<transcript>: You've always had permission. I think you just don't want to.

03:26:15
mohamemahmouddewida: SeemsGood

03:26:16
<transcript>: So I used to in my overlay app. I triggered the jib through the sdk when I went to break. I had it like pan away, but I kind of like this effect better.

03:26:16
<transcript>: anyway

03:26:18
<transcript>: Anyway, why not Versell.

03:26:18
<transcript>: well

03:26:20
thdxr: devagarawal09 is actually adam's mom

03:26:28
<transcript>: Well, that means there's a lot of traffic. And I think versello we would actually pay for and not be in the free tier, and that would not be fun. So we're doing an on idea this account. That's why.

03:26:28
<transcript>: apologize

03:26:32
<transcript>: Apologize for the language. Are you fine? And you're fine? Same hat.

03:26:36
<transcript>: Mom Dev.

03:26:41
devagrawal09: i can neither confirm nor deny

03:26:41
<transcript>: Yeah, dev is actually my mom. Welcome to Chat Mo.

03:26:41
<transcript>: hammer

03:26:41
thdxr: also they need to connect to a DB in a vpc

03:26:44
<transcript>: Hammer? I'm gonna bought your name so bad.

03:26:44
<transcript>: i'm gonna call you

03:26:47
<transcript>: I'm gonna call you Mo. Welcome to chatmo.

03:26:47
<transcript>: i can either

03:26:50
<transcript>: I can either confirm nor dividends nor tonight.

03:26:55
<transcript>: It'll be funny if you on Twitter was awesome. My mom, like if dad this whole time.

03:26:55
<transcript>: and my mom was

03:26:58
<transcript>: And my mom was super into tech and had a YouTube channel.

03:26:58
<transcript>: and

03:27:08
<transcript>: And hired someone to do the YouTube acting, but really, it's her. This all. Okay. I'm gonna do part with this. They need to connect to a db in a V PC. That's right. We do need to do that.

03:27:08
<transcript>: couldn't do that

03:27:28
<transcript>: Couldn't do that on for cell. Could we? Okay. What am I trying to do here? This is so dumb. I'm hung up on the dumbest little things. I'm trying to. I'm just trying to prevent. What did I just do? I'm just trying to prevent this. Let me show you. I'm trying to prevent having to say, like, the second tab is hidden. I guess it's not a big deal, but I don't want to have to do this.

03:27:36
<transcript>: I don't want to have to set the initial state outside. I wanted to just do it. I want the component to do something for me, you know.

03:27:40
<transcript>: I want the component to be smart.

03:27:44
<transcript>: Save me some stroke you know.

03:27:44
<transcript>: as

03:27:45
<transcript>: As in keystrokes.

03:27:48
etts: i think vercel is built on aws

03:27:49
devagrawal09: at what point is a vpc not overkill

03:27:50
<transcript>: I just want it to be smart. What do I have to do.

03:27:50
<transcript>: to make

03:27:59
<transcript>: To make the tabs components smart. First time chat. Welcome to Chat. It's. I think versell is built on aws, it is and clap, flare and other stuff. Probably.

03:28:02
<transcript>: At what point is a vpc not overkill.

03:28:14
mr_yan19: *the internet is built on aws

03:28:15
<transcript>: At what point is it not overkill? So it's overkill. At what point is it not overkill? So the only reason Dev that I'm doing that I have to connect to a db and a V PC is.

03:28:15
<transcript>: that it's an

03:28:26
<transcript>: That it's an existing database, and I'm trying to minimize effort, trying to get this thing rewritten with as little effort as possible. So we're not migrating everything to dynamo, which is what I kind of want to do.

03:28:32
<transcript>: We're sticking with our existing postgres rds database and I just need to be a good citizen and connect to it.

03:28:43
<transcript>: Okay. How's this work? People, people. I need answers. Someone come through someone smart. Tell me what to do here. Just tell me there's a tab component.

03:28:43
<transcript>: there's a

03:28:47
<transcript>: There's a tabs component. How do I make the tabs component? Smart.

03:28:47
devagrawal09: yeah but does it have to be in a VPC

03:28:49
<transcript>: Oh.

03:28:49
<transcript>: can i do

03:29:01
<transcript>: Can I do everything but the first child? Can I add hidden to everything but the first child? Oh, I bet that's a thing, but that's the thing tailwind or just css selector.

03:29:03
<transcript>: Every.

03:29:03
<transcript>: thing

03:29:06
<transcript>: Thing but child.

03:29:06
<transcript>: i'm

03:29:08
<transcript>: I'm sorry buff first.

03:29:10
<transcript>: But first.

03:29:10
<transcript>: thank you so much

03:29:10
thdxr: VPCs should be 100% avoided now

03:29:12
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the follows.

03:29:13
thdxr: but sometims you can't

03:29:15
<transcript>: Echo night? And Gustavo.

03:29:20
<transcript>: Yeah, but does it have to be in the V PC.

03:29:23
<transcript>: Sometimes you can't.

03:29:24
thdxr: I wouldn't know that if I was a frontend dev

03:29:29
<transcript>: I love that next vpc should be 100% avoided now, but sometimes you can't.

03:29:30
etts: isnt vpc best practice? is not overkill to isolate your network

03:29:32
<transcript>: I wouldn't know that if I was a friend and then that's true.

03:29:36
<transcript>: Jan. Hine, Big Jon, Chef. Follow.

03:29:40
<transcript>: Not can I say not first.

03:29:42
<transcript>: Not first.

03:29:42
<transcript>: how do i

03:29:47
<transcript>: How do I do that? In tailwind, tailwind, arbitrary, arbitrary.

03:29:47
<transcript>: selectors

03:29:48
<transcript>: Selectors.

03:29:50
devagrawal09: yeah that's what i thought

03:29:50
<transcript>: Not first.

03:29:52
thdxr: nah vpc is for securing things that can't integrate with centralized auth

03:29:56
thdxr: and most things can now

03:30:00
<transcript>: Isn't vpc best practice. It is not overkill to isolate your network. I don't want to know about networks. I think that's the thing. I don't want to know what a network is.

03:30:05
<transcript>: Vpc is for securing things that can't integrate with centralized auth, and most things can now.

03:30:11
gustabo107: man i loved that camera thing

03:30:15
<transcript>: The answer is this in link. The last in the docs that you shared last. I don't want last. I want not first.

03:30:19
<transcript>: Last would not be what I'm looking for.

03:30:21
<transcript>: Not last child.

03:30:25
devagrawal09: yeah tell that to DHH

03:30:29
thdxr: lol

03:30:29
<transcript>: I want.

03:30:32
<transcript>: So not.

03:30:36
<transcript>: Laugh. Can I just do not last? Okay, let's try this.

03:30:39
<transcript>: Not.

03:30:41
<transcript>: Last.

03:30:41
thdxr: my goal is to get to adam's level of stream quality on linux and be the linux streaming guru

03:30:44
<transcript>: No, I think I need to do the.

03:30:46
<transcript>: N sign.

03:30:48
<transcript>: And.

03:30:51
<transcript>: Not last.

03:30:53
<transcript>: No, not first.

03:30:53
<transcript>: i don't think i can

03:30:55
<transcript>: I don't think I can do it like this.

03:30:55
devagrawal09: doesn't prime stream on linux

03:30:57
thdxr: made some major  breakthroughs this week

03:30:59
<transcript>: If it's not first, I want it hidden. Does it work.

03:31:01
<transcript>: No, it didn't work.

03:31:04
<transcript>: Did not work.

03:31:04
thdxr: Prime has a streaming PC that runs windows I'm pretty sure

03:31:06
stroopwafel26: does linux have drivers for streaming? /s

03:31:11
<transcript>: Oh, man, I love that camera thing. Yeah. No, I didn't.

03:31:11
<transcript>: i

03:31:16
<transcript>: I've put a lot of work into making this stream. High production quality.

03:31:16
<transcript>: the content

03:31:17
<transcript>: The content itself.

03:31:17
<transcript>: not always

03:31:19
<transcript>: Not always.

03:31:22
<transcript>: Sometimes we watch me for 4 hours.

03:31:22
<transcript>: i'll mostly

03:31:23
mr_yan19: sst is pretty interesting.  Looks like it takes on IaC and the the whole CICD pipeline?

03:31:23
devagrawal09: @stroopwafel26 great question

03:31:23
<transcript>: I'll mostly read chat.

03:31:23
<transcript>: and

03:31:24
etts: but for least privilege sake, you still want to isolate your resources. lets say you have ec2 instances that are just for internal use. a private vpc will isolate them from the internet

03:31:33
stroopwafel26: it's the year of linux streaming on the desktop

03:31:37
<transcript>: And type like 15 lines of bad javascript. Some days, though we accomplish things like today today we accomplished things, but there will always be good production quality. It'll always be good production quality. Sometimes good content.

03:31:39
gustabo107: quality is amazing  congrats

03:31:42
<transcript>: I made some major breakthroughs this week. Prime has a streaming PC that runs Windows. I'm pretty sure.

03:31:45
<transcript>: My goal is to get to.

03:31:45
<transcript>: ad

03:31:48
mr_yan19: @devagrawal09 he uses windows

03:31:54
<transcript>: Adam's level of stream quality on linux and be the linux streaming guru. You would be the linux streaming goose. If you get this level quality analytics, you could.

03:31:57
<transcript>: Thanks, Gasabo.

03:31:59
<transcript>: Okay.

03:31:59
<transcript>: least privile

03:32:01
thdxr: you shouldn't have ec2 instances Kreygasm

03:32:14
<transcript>: Least privilege sake. You still want to isolate your resources. Let's say you have EC two instances that are just for internal use of private Vpc will isolate them from the Internet. I hear you at I do. And you're probably right. But I think I'm just drank the serverless koolaid so much I just hate when I have to have a vpc.

03:32:15
gustabo107: i think he has audio problems on linux

03:32:22
<transcript>: Okay, so I'm gonna figure out this selector. It's got to be possible.

03:32:22
<transcript>: and

03:32:24
<transcript>: And.

03:32:24
<transcript>: can i just

03:32:29
<transcript>: Can I just do what they did? I saw something here. Like this.

03:32:29
<transcript>: and not

03:32:32
<transcript>: And not last child. So in not first child maybe.

03:32:34
gustabo107: that why he uses windows

03:32:34
<transcript>: Let's try that.

03:32:38
<transcript>: Oh no.

03:32:39
devagrawal09: screw ec2, all my homies love lambdas

03:32:41
<transcript>: It's too late, isn't it.

03:32:44
<transcript>: No. Yep. Too late.

03:32:50
<transcript>: Copy. I always do this overwrite my register.

03:32:54
<transcript>: Okay, first child.

03:32:54
<transcript>: first

03:32:55
<transcript>: First child.

03:32:59
<transcript>: So not first child should be hidden.

03:32:59
<transcript>: come on

03:33:00
<transcript>: Come on.

03:33:03
etts: @thdxr for use cases that run constantly, ec2 instances are cheaper than lambda

03:33:03
<transcript>: Work work Work work.

03:33:05
<transcript>: No.

03:33:06
stroopwafel26: @gustabo107 memories of using ALSA

03:33:07
<transcript>: Still not the way you do it.

03:33:08
coolpantstv: ".space-y-4 > *:not(:first-child) { display: none; }"

03:33:12
devagrawal09: aight im gonna dip for a while

03:33:16
<transcript>: How to create a class that uses odd.

03:33:16
<transcript>: child suit

03:33:18
<transcript>: Child suit to selector.

03:33:22
<transcript>: I just want every.

03:33:26
coolpantstv: Might need to add a custom tailwind property

03:33:32
<transcript>: Not in csa, intel, and CSS.

03:33:36
<transcript>: Do I need to do the arrow.

03:33:41
<transcript>: Like this.

03:33:41
etts: sorry @adamdotdev, I went on a tangent

03:33:44
<transcript>: Thank you for the follows. Mr.

03:33:46
<transcript>: Rosen.

03:33:48
<transcript>: And Jan.

<transcript>: Using guantana, your finance. This entire stream is a tangent you never have to worry about.

03:33:55
<transcript>: saying something

03:33:58
<transcript>: Saying something. Oh, hey, cool pants.

03:33:58
<transcript>: star

03:33:59
<transcript>: Star.

03:34:04
<transcript>: Not first child.

03:34:11
<transcript>: Oh, is that that's actually csf, though I'm trying to do it in tailwind. I think I can do it in tailwind.

03:34:11
<transcript>: that's what

03:34:12
<transcript>: That's what I'm trying to do.

03:34:16
<transcript>: I think it's possible.

03:34:18
<transcript>: Oh.

03:34:21
<transcript>: No, it didn't hide that one either. Okay.

03:34:21
<transcript>: so

03:34:24
<transcript>: So not quite we're closer. Maybe.

03:34:31
<transcript>: Not for child. I want not first child. Tailwind.

03:34:31
<transcript>: select

03:34:33
<transcript>: Selector.

03:34:33
<transcript>: knock

03:34:35

<transcript>: Can I not do that without doing this.

03:35:22
<transcript>: List not first child.

03:35:32
thdxr: @GlamShatterskull imagine saying this sentence a year ago

03:35:34
<transcript>: Rosen, welcome to Chat Ash, Chat gpt. It's pretty much straightforward response. Hey, that's a great, great idea. Hijack, the engineer. Welcome to chat.

03:35:37
<transcript>: Oh, great idea, Chad. Jbt.

03:35:37
<transcript>: let's

03:35:39
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:35:45
<transcript>: Let's say how do I write a tailwind css selector.

03:35:47
<transcript>: That.

03:35:47
<transcript>: applies

03:35:49
<transcript>: Applies to.

03:35:49
<transcript>: every

03:35:50
glamshatterskull: @thdxr i can't... but it's true LUL

03:36:12
<transcript>: Not in first child pseudoclasses in combination to creation applies to every child except the first child. In the context of tail and css, you can use the Apply directive. Oh no, don't do that. I want arbitrary variants.

03:36:14
stroopwafel26: I'm not gonna use Edge

03:36:15
<transcript>: I want an arbitrary variant.

03:36:16
stroopwafel26: but thanks

03:36:18
<transcript>: No.

03:36:19
<transcript>: Don't do that.

03:36:20
thdxr: tell it not to use apply

03:36:20
glamshatterskull: bing app on phone

03:36:21
thdxr: it'll do it

03:36:23
<transcript>: Let's see if we can do it with arbitrary variants.

03:36:24
glamshatterskull: but you're welcome

03:36:35
<transcript>: Can it be done with arbitrary variants? Stop generating.

03:38:04
<transcript>: Do I.

03:38:13
<transcript>: Also did not find not first. So here's the plugin I wrote. I guess I could do this. This is what Chat gbt site should do.

03:38:13
<transcript>: let's

03:38:16
<transcript>: Let's try it. And if it works.

03:38:16
<transcript>: we could

03:38:19
<transcript>: We could stick with it. I just thought I could just do this, you know.

03:38:23
<transcript>: Tailwind.

03:38:32
<transcript>: Plugin.

03:38:37
<transcript>: Okay. And then we need to add.

<transcript>: Tailwind. We need to import plugin Const plugin.

03:38:43
glamshatterskull: because capitalism? browser wars be browser wars.

03:38:48
<transcript>: Do I need to actually install that or is it just installed by default.

03:38:53
<transcript>: Let's see, plugin.

03:38:54
glamshatterskull: new story same as the old story

03:38:56
<transcript>: Plugin.

03:39:00
<transcript>: Does this work now can I just say not first.

03:39:00
<transcript>: let's see the

03:39:01
<transcript>: Let's see the.

03:39:01
<transcript>: lead

03:39:02
<transcript>: Lead.

03:39:02
<transcript>: to

03:39:08
<transcript>: To.

03:39:09
<transcript>: Not first.

03:39:09
<transcript>: This works.

03:39:09
<transcript>: i

03:39:13
<transcript>: I will be happy. I don't care if it's not ideal.

03:39:15
<transcript>: No.

03:39:17
<transcript>: It does not work.

03:39:17
stroopwafel26: but all browsers are the same now

03:39:20
<transcript>: Does not work.

03:39:20
<transcript>: does not

03:39:27
<transcript>: Does not work? Why does it not work? Does it not work because of an Astro or a tailwind problem.

03:39:31
<transcript>: Okay, this is a bummer.

03:39:38
<transcript>: Should I just do it outside the component feels so bad.

03:39:42
<transcript>: I just don't like not making progress. And this has been a lot of not making progress.

03:39:42
<transcript>: maybe

03:39:46
luisdaprogrammer: Why you don't just create the class ?

03:39:46
<transcript>: Maybe I'll try restarting just in case.

03:39:49
securibee: What do you want to do?

03:39:53
<transcript>: Just in case I have to add the variant. Why don't you just create the class? Oh, yeah, I guess I could do that.

03:39:57
<transcript>: What do you want to do? I just want to apply.

03:39:57
<transcript>: to

03:40:02
<transcript>: To I want to apply hidden to everything with the first element.

03:40:02
<transcript>: first

03:40:05
<transcript>: First child element. Okay.

03:40:07
<transcript>: That's what I want to do.

03:40:07
<transcript>: i

03:40:11
<transcript>: I wanted to do it with arbitrary variants, but I guess I can.

03:40:13
<transcript>: I guess I cannot.

03:40:13
<transcript>: and

03:40:18
<transcript>: And instead, I'm just gonna write the class. I'm just gonna write the class.

03:40:19
coolpantstv: paste the plugin code to chatgpt and ask it how to use it

03:40:26
<transcript>: We'll do it like this.

03:40:29
<transcript>: Don't just write the style inline.

03:40:31
<transcript>: So do that.

03:40:34
<transcript>: Like this.

03:40:38
<transcript>: Just like having it colocated. You know, I just like having it right here.

03:40:45
<transcript>: I'm just gonna do this. I'm gonna try this. We'll see tab, panel, tab, panel.

03:40:48
<transcript>: And we're gonna say.

03:40:56
<transcript>: Back to Chat gpt. It had given us.

03:40:56
<transcript>: this solution

03:40:57
<transcript>: This solution.

03:40:57
<transcript>: it's not pl

03:41:00
<transcript>: It's not plugin like this.

03:41:00
<transcript>: not

03:41:02
<transcript>: Not first child so.

03:41:04
<transcript>: Like this.

03:41:08
<transcript>: Not first child.

03:41:11
<transcript>: Panel.

03:41:16
<transcript>: I guess this is a tab panel. This is a tabs control.

03:41:18
<transcript>: Abs.

03:41:26
<transcript>: Oh, ds Legends. Thank you so much. Pran sub. Sorry I got ahead of myself. Thank you so much for the prime sub.

03:41:26
<transcript>: i appreciate

03:41:31
<transcript>: I appreciate that so much. Ds Legends your legend.

03:41:31
<transcript>: subscribe

03:41:32
<transcript>: Subscribe.

03:41:35
<transcript>: Tabs.

03:41:35
<transcript>: not

03:41:38
<transcript>: Not for child display. None.

03:41:41
<transcript>: But actually I'm going to do apply.

03:41:41
<transcript>: apply

03:41:42
<transcript>: Apply.

03:41:49
<transcript>: Stuff. Okay. So how about that.

03:41:49
<transcript>: does that work

03:41:51
<transcript>: Does that work.

03:41:51
<transcript>: and i can go back

03:41:54
<transcript>: And I can go back to my tailwind.

03:41:56
<transcript>: And delete this plugin thing.

03:42:04
<transcript>: Okay.

03:42:07
etts: what is that font?

03:42:17
<transcript>: Let's try it. Let's try it. What is that? Font? Operator mono. Is the font. Oh, I think it works.

03:42:17
<transcript>: no

03:42:20
<transcript>: No, it doesn't. Because it's not hiding that one.

03:42:23
<transcript>: Why.

03:42:25
<transcript>: Are you not being hidden.

03:42:31
<transcript>: Why let's look at the parent and see.

03:42:33
<transcript>: What are all the.

03:42:36
<transcript>: So here's the tabs.

03:42:36
<transcript>: and there's

03:42:41
<transcript>: And there's no style. Okay. So I thought I could define an astro. Let's see.

03:42:41
<transcript>: astro

03:42:45
<transcript>: Astro Style. I thought I could just do like a style. Block.

03:42:45
<transcript>: easy setting

03:42:54
<transcript>: Easy setting a style tag to your component or page template. When you place a style tag into an astro component, Astrocheck, css, and halo Charge for your automatically. I wanted to keep it colocated, you know.

03:43:02
<transcript>: Well.

03:43:02
<transcript>: apparently

03:43:04
<transcript>: Apparently that doesn't work.

03:43:14
<transcript>: Do I need to define the style tag above.

03:43:18
<transcript>: Here.

03:43:18
<transcript>: maybe

03:43:19
<transcript>: Maybe.

03:43:19
<transcript>: tabs

03:43:20
<transcript>: Tabs.

03:43:26
<transcript>: Tabs and then we go not first child applied hidden.

03:43:30
<transcript>: How's that.

03:43:30
<transcript>: tell me what

03:43:32
<transcript>: Tell me what's wrong with it.

03:43:32
<transcript>: we also have

03:43:35
<transcript>: We also have the problem of this not being.

03:43:35
<transcript>: the

03:43:39
<transcript>: The first selected state.

03:43:46
<transcript>: Oh, you know what we could do.

03:43:46
<transcript>: maybe

03:43:48
<transcript>: Maybe.

03:43:51
stroopwafel26: !font

03:43:52
fossabot: Adam uses the Dracula theme with the Operator Mono font in Neovim.

03:43:55
<transcript>: What was that? Did I get another follower or something? I heard something. Was it a message? Do I get a message.

03:43:55
<transcript>: on

03:43:55
securibee: [&>:not(*:first-child)]:hidden

03:43:59
<transcript>: On I might have got a message on.

03:44:09
<transcript>: Discord. Okay. And not First Child hidden. Does that work? That arbitrary variant. Does that work? I think I tried that. Oh, I didn't do the Star, though.

03:44:09
<transcript>: oh i didn't

03:44:11
<transcript>: Oh, I didn't do the star.

03:44:11
<transcript>: oh does this work

03:44:13
<transcript>: Oh, does this work.

03:44:18
<transcript>: Does this work.

03:44:22
<transcript>: Fun delete? That as if I know it's gonna work.

03:44:31
<transcript>: It works.

03:44:31
<transcript>: your

03:44:34
<transcript>: Your legend security.

03:44:34
<transcript>: look at you

03:44:35
<transcript>: Look at you.

03:44:35
<transcript>: oh no

03:44:38
<transcript>: Oh, no, but that's not being displayed.

03:44:40
glamshatterskull: you're hired

03:44:43
<transcript>: I probably understand why though because it's got class block. But what's wrong.

03:44:45
<transcript>: That selector.

03:44:45
<transcript>: so how do i

03:44:49
<transcript>: So how do I override that selector.

03:44:49
<transcript>: should

03:44:53
<transcript>: Should I just instead of applying classes? Should I just like override the style.

03:44:53
<transcript>: you're hired

03:44:56
<transcript>: You're hired. That is awesome.

03:44:56
<transcript>: it's exactly

03:45:00
<transcript>: It's exactly what I wanted, except now I can't seem to override it.

03:45:03
<transcript>: Interesting.

03:45:10
<transcript>: What if down here instead of doing this? What if I did this? What if I said panel dot style.

03:45:10
<transcript>: display

03:45:11
<transcript>: Display.

03:45:14
<transcript>: Yeah equals block.

03:45:14
<transcript>: and then

03:45:18
<transcript>: And then down here. Oh, no, I can't do that.

03:45:21
<transcript>: What? What's? All that.

03:45:26
<transcript>: Panel is an element.

03:45:29
<transcript>: Oh, no? What.

03:45:33
coolpantstv: why not hide them all and append an active class when active, that updates the display

03:45:33
<transcript>: Should this be an element.

03:45:43
<transcript>: What's the problem here.

03:45:43
<transcript>: what's the

03:45:44
<transcript>: What's the problem here.

03:45:46
<transcript>: Panel.

03:45:54
<transcript>: What is it.

03:46:00
<transcript>: I thought I was casting this earlier. Why is it not cast it anymore? Oh, yeah, it is. Tabs is casted.

03:46:05
<transcript>: But panel is a separate oh, it's a separate thing. So I need to do as.

03:46:10
<transcript>: Html element.

03:46:12
<transcript>: Right.

03:46:18
<transcript>: As unknown this is getting so ugly.

03:46:21
<transcript>: As unknown.

03:46:23
<transcript>: Okay.

03:46:24
glamshatterskull: getting?

03:46:28
glamshatterskull: LUL

03:46:29
<transcript>: Panel style that display.

03:46:29
<transcript>: block

03:46:31
<transcript>: Block.

03:46:33
<transcript>: And.

03:46:40
<transcript>: Okay.

03:46:41
<transcript>: If that works.

03:46:48
<transcript>: Why not hide them all and append an active class when active that updates to the display.

03:46:53
<transcript>: Okay. That's.

03:47:02
<transcript>: Better. So you're saying Hide them all. Appended an Active class when active. That updates the display. Now how do I make.

03:47:05
<transcript>: It override the.

03:47:19
<transcript>: Each tab panel. So I do have a tab panel.

03:47:21
<transcript>: So this should have a class.

03:47:25
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:47:28
<transcript>: Class list.

03:47:30
<transcript>: Equals.

03:47:37
<transcript>: And then Astro.

03:47:44
<transcript>: Props class. Okay. So I can override. Yeah. So here we would say, active.

03:47:44
<transcript>: oh but it's not

03:47:47
<transcript>: Oh, but it's not the div. It's active with in.

03:47:47
<transcript>: is that saying

03:47:50
<transcript>: Is that saying active within.

03:47:52
<transcript>: Block.

03:48:00
<transcript>: Hidden. So if it's act. Oh, I think this is it. I think this is it. I don't know if active within is actually a thing.

03:48:02
<transcript>: Delete.

03:48:02
<transcript>: i can just delete

03:48:04
<transcript>: I can just delete all that, right? Yeah.

03:48:10
<transcript>: Delete to what.

03:48:15
<transcript>: No.

03:48:17
<transcript>: That works.

03:48:17
<transcript>: div

03:48:19
<transcript>: Div slot. Okay.

03:48:23
<transcript>: Then over here. I'm gonna do this.

03:48:30
<transcript>: I guess I didn't have to do all that casting.

03:48:37
<transcript>: Little housekeeping. Okay, let's see. Does that work? No.

03:48:37
<transcript>: active within

03:48:46
<transcript>: Active within. Oh, active within does work. It's just the initial state that's not being so. I need to make the first one active. Let me do that.

03:48:46
<transcript>: no no

03:48:48
<transcript>: No, no, no.

03:48:51
<transcript>: What's wrong here.

03:48:59
<transcript>: This wouldn't imply no javascript. It's active within was a thing.

03:49:01
<transcript>: Right.

03:49:06
<transcript>: I don't know what I'm doing tailwind active within.

03:49:15
<transcript>: Active.

03:49:23
<transcript>: Is that like child active.

03:49:31
<transcript>: Is that what that means? If you have a child active.

03:49:36
<transcript>: So that means.

03:49:38
lalex2106: Not child

03:49:40
<transcript>: Could I make this all work? Hang on.

03:49:44
<transcript>: My side brain so done not child.

03:49:44
<transcript>: it's not a child

03:49:46
<transcript>: It's not a child, is it because.

03:49:50
lalex2106: Current node clases as

03:49:52
<transcript>: Panel.

03:49:52

<transcript>: unless what

03:50:20
<transcript>: Unless, what.

03:50:22
<transcript>: Unless.

03:50:22
<transcript>: the javascript

03:50:24
lalex2106: Classed as*

03:50:25
<transcript>: The javascript says, don't hide it.

03:50:28
<transcript>: So delete.

03:50:28
<transcript>: to

03:50:32
<transcript>: To like that? So they're all gonna be hidden to start.

03:50:32
<transcript>: maybe

03:50:33
<transcript>: Maybe.

03:50:37
<transcript>: And then in tab.

03:50:37
<transcript>: we're not doing

03:50:39
<transcript>: We're not doing anything with the children.

03:50:45
<transcript>: We just need to get the initial state. Then that's the only thing we're missing. Thanks. Joshua. Follows.

03:50:45
<transcript>: pushing to get these

03:50:51
<transcript>: Pushing to get these initial state. I think this works. Except for the initial state.

03:50:51
<transcript>: thank you so much for

03:50:54
<transcript>: Thank you so much for following gill or something.

03:50:57
<transcript>: Gilliam.

03:51:01
<transcript>: Sorry for text record. You're fine.

03:51:01
<transcript>: so everything

03:51:07
<transcript>: So everything right now is good. Except for the initial state. The initial state. We don't have this one selected initially.

03:51:07
<transcript>: thanks for

03:51:10
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow Vlad.

03:51:17
<transcript>: And that is a problem. The problem is we don't have the initial state. I guess I could set the initial state in here.

03:51:17
<transcript>: oh

03:51:19
<transcript>: Oh, should I just do it inside.

03:51:19
<transcript>: i

03:51:24
<transcript>: I'd really rather not I'd rather already be okay first.

03:51:27
<transcript>: What if it's.

03:51:27
<transcript>: first

03:51:28
<transcript>: First.

03:51:30
<transcript>: Black.

03:51:36
<transcript>: That doesn't work, does it? It's.

03:51:41
<transcript>: This isn't even displayed. So what's that mean? If we go to the tab control.

03:51:41
<transcript>: check

03:51:45
<transcript>: Checked? Oh, I need to set, checked? I need to set, check.

03:51:47
looch94: Do you usually start at 6am?

03:51:50
<transcript>: It's gonna be block, yeah, Yeah.

03:51:54
<transcript>: So I need to set checked on the first one. How do I do that.

03:52:01
<transcript>: How do I set check on the first one.

03:52:04
<transcript>: Without the.

03:52:06
<transcript>: Without JavaScript.

03:52:08
<transcript>: I'm.

03:52:08
<transcript>: here

03:52:13
<transcript>: Here. And maybe I'm just gonna do it out here for now because I'm just tired of working on this. I think I just do, like.

03:52:17
<transcript>: Oh.

03:52:17
<transcript>: it's the tag

03:52:19
<transcript>: It's the tag component.

03:52:23
<transcript>: It's a tabs component.

03:52:23
<transcript>: it

03:52:30
<transcript>: It's the tab component. It has a creature right here. Checked. Check. Oh, we figured it out.

03:52:32
<transcript>: Checked equals.

03:52:34
<transcript>: Zero.

03:52:34
<transcript>: so

03:52:36
<transcript>: So I.

03:52:40
<transcript>: Oh, did we do it.

03:52:40
<transcript>: we did it

<transcript>: We did it.

03:52:42
<transcript>: i think we did it

03:52:43
<transcript>: I think we did it.

03:52:47
<transcript>: We did not do it.

03:52:52
<transcript>: I thought we did it. We did not do it.

03:53:02
mattmancodes: It's the hope that kills

03:53:03
<transcript>: So the initial state. This is better. So now the bar shows up. That's correct. So the thing is checked. But we don't. We're not checking. We're not making this one displayed. Still not doing that.

03:53:03
<transcript>: and i feel

03:53:07
<transcript>: And I feel like this could be done with a like.

03:53:09
<transcript>: First. Something.

03:53:12
<transcript>: How do you do the important thing? Can you do an important.

03:53:15
<transcript>: Inline stuff.

<transcript>: I'm sorry. I'm sorry for that. Chris.

03:54:27
<transcript>: you've been suggesting

03:54:30
<transcript>: You've been suggesting to my hot takes.

03:54:30
<transcript>: i'm just

03:54:39
<transcript>: I'm just not a take person. I'm really not. And I'm realizing that about myself. Okay, let's see what this does. So I bet it is applied. Let's just look.

03:54:43
<transcript>: I'm not a I'm not a person that has picks.

03:54:43
<transcript>: so when i do

03:54:51
<transcript>: So when I do have one, I have to tell everyone about it. I have to announce it. First block. So does this one have first block.

03:54:51
<transcript>: no

03:54:52
<transcript>: No.

03:54:52
<transcript>: is it

03:54:54
<transcript>: Is it not first.

03:54:54
<transcript>: first isn't

03:54:57
<transcript>: First? Isn't first child? Is that not.

03:54:57
flexboxlive: What is it? @LLCoolChris_ share it we will watch in live next week 🤣

03:54:59
llcoolchris_: Lmaooo I feel you

03:54:59
<transcript>: Tailwind.

03:54:59
<transcript>: first

03:55:01
<transcript>: First.

03:55:05
<transcript>: Child selector. I don't think it's first. I think there's something else.

03:55:05
<transcript>: i have to do something else

03:55:06
<transcript>: I have to do something else.

03:55:15
<transcript>: First child.

03:55:18
<transcript>: No, yeah, it's just first.

03:55:22
<transcript>: Is that if it is the first.

03:55:27
<transcript>: Or is that your first child.

03:55:31
<transcript>: The first onto the list. When I do first, it doesn't work for me.

03:55:39
<transcript>: First Child selector.

03:55:43
<transcript>: Who's last child? Maybe.

03:55:43
<transcript>: last

03:55:47
<transcript>: Last to tart the last child. In your case.

03:55:52
<transcript>: What is this? Music.

03:55:59
<transcript>: So you know that's like if when it is the first or last child, that's not what I want. That's not what I want.

03:56:03
<transcript>: I want the first shot. So I think it's like.

03:56:03
<transcript>: this

03:56:05
<transcript>: This hang on.

03:56:08
<transcript>: It's gonna be like.

03:56:15
<transcript>: First.

03:56:17
<transcript>: Oh.

03:56:19
<transcript>: Like this.

03:56:22
<transcript>: Like this take all the children.

03:56:22
<transcript>: and then

03:56:26
<transcript>: And then the first one gets blocked. Important.

03:56:30
<transcript>: importantly it works

03:56:30
<transcript>: Importantly, it works.

03:56:30
<transcript>: it did

03:56:32
<transcript>: It did not.

03:56:35
<transcript>: What am I doing wrong here.

03:56:41
<transcript>: Arbitrary variant why I struggle with this so much tailwind tail, wind arbitrary.

03:56:45
<transcript>: Selectors. First.

03:56:47
<transcript>: Child.

03:56:53
<transcript>: Children selectors.

03:57:03
<transcript>: Be fair. Sometimes children.

03:57:03
<transcript>: be my premise

03:57:04
<transcript>: Be my premise.

03:57:20
<transcript>: Combinator.

03:57:22
<transcript>: In the docs.

03:57:29
<transcript>: First.

03:57:31
<transcript>: Search first.

03:57:43
<transcript>: Child. Oh, this might be what I want style, Ellen element. If it's a first child, that's not what I want.

03:57:47
<transcript>: I want to style from the parent.

03:57:49
<transcript>: Come on.

03:57:49
<transcript>: i got figure

03:57:51
<transcript>: I got figure this out.

03:57:51
<transcript>: we're so close

03:57:52
<transcript>: We're so close.

03:57:59
<transcript>: I want the child if it's the first.

03:58:06
<transcript>: Maybe we'll just do css Electric css selector.

03:58:06
<transcript>: first

03:58:08
<transcript>: First child.

03:58:27
<transcript>: Interesting.

03:58:30
<transcript>: I don't know.

03:58:35
<transcript>: I feel like this is easy and I am stuck.

03:58:45
<transcript>: List. I don't want an I don't I can't do anything directly with the children because they're in a slot. I need first child.

03:58:51
<transcript>: But I only want to apply it to all this children elements if they're the first child. Does that make sense.

03:58:53
<transcript>: Does that make sense? Does that make sense? I don't know.

03:58:58
<transcript>: First direct child only.

03:59:03
<transcript>: So if I do that.

03:59:08
<transcript>: Div. Okay, so, star. Oh, this might be it.

03:59:08
sockthedev: ask chatgpt?

03:59:11
<transcript>: Like that maybe.

03:59:13
<transcript>: As Chat gpt. That's a good idea.

03:59:13
<transcript>: let's

03:59:17
<transcript>: Let's see if this worked first and then Oh.

03:59:22
<transcript>: I think we did it. No.

03:59:24
<transcript>: Not like this.

03:59:24
<transcript>: why is

03:59:30
<transcript>: Why is that? Oh, cause it's important. So now the block is important. So this one never gets hidden.

03:59:30
<transcript>: such

03:59:32
<transcript>: Such a cluster.

03:59:32
<transcript>: oh man

03:59:33
<transcript>: Oh, man.

03:59:33
<transcript>: so see

03:59:33
mattmancodes: LUL

03:59:35
<transcript>: So see this one.

03:59:35
<transcript>: here

03:59:38
<transcript>: Here team stats has block important.

03:59:38
<transcript>: and even

03:59:43
<transcript>: And even after the javascript trick kicks it in and does.

03:59:43
<transcript>: oh

03:59:45
<transcript>: Oh, because it's not a class that it's removing.

03:59:50
<transcript>: Ha.

03:59:50
<transcript>: so

03:59:54
<transcript>: So I needed to apply a class to the first one. Maybe.

04:00:00
<transcript>: So this instead of block important. We need it to be.

04:00:08
<transcript>: What happens if it's just block? Because then it would go removed, right.

04:00:11
<transcript>: Or would it no.

04:00:14
<transcript>: What a mess.

04:00:14
<transcript>: this

04:00:24
<transcript>: This is all because I'm trying to do it nashro with a component and it's a slot and I can't directly access the children. But I want to make the api nice. It's just a lot of problems.

04:00:24
<transcript>: they're all coming together

04:00:26
<transcript>: They're all coming together.

04:00:26
<transcript>: to make this

04:00:28
<transcript>: To make this weird map mess.

04:00:28
<transcript>: so

04:00:31
<transcript>: So let's just assign a class to it.

04:00:31
<transcript>: active

04:00:33
<transcript>: Active.

04:00:37
<transcript>: Well assign a class active to it.

04:00:43
<transcript>: And then active will define up here style.

04:00:53
<transcript>: Is act like a keyword or something? Can I not use active.

04:00:53
<transcript>: active

04:00:56
<transcript>: Active is going to be oh Geez.

04:00:56
<transcript>: no

04:01:00
<transcript>: No active is going to be apply.

04:01:03
<transcript>: Block important.

04:01:03
<transcript>: like that

04:01:05
<transcript>: Like that.

04:01:08
<transcript>: Think of the follow.

04:01:08
<transcript>: melly

04:01:09
<transcript>: Melly.

04:01:14
<transcript>: Mellie, melly, melly? I've only got oh, I've got negative. One minutes left. Awesome.

04:01:23
<transcript>: Apply block. So we apply active to it there. And then we'll just code remove it. Remove active is what we should remove.

04:01:25
<transcript>: Add.

04:01:25
<transcript>: active

04:01:27
<transcript>: Active.

04:01:31
<transcript>: If that works, and then I have to get off here.

04:01:34
<transcript>: Does not work.

04:01:44
<transcript>: It works on a second so class active class hidden class active so it works the second time around but not the first.

04:01:46
<transcript>: Is active.

04:01:49
<transcript>: I don't know.

04:01:52
<transcript>: I've been looking at this too long.

04:01:54
<transcript>: Join it.

04:01:54
<transcript>: based

04:01:55
<transcript>: Based.
