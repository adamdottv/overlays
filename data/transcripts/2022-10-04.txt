00:12:43
<transcript>: I can relate with that. I'm definitely sleeping later these days. This is.

00:12:51
<transcript>: I'm not gonna go into a devil position. I don't think I'd be good at everel position.

00:12:51
<transcript>: i

00:12:53
<transcript>: I.

00:12:56
<transcript>: I don't know what I'm good at, but I don't think I'd be good at that.

00:13:02
<transcript>: So I went on a little day trip. We went to Kansas City, which is like a three hour drive.

00:13:02
<transcript>: and

00:13:04
<transcript>: And.

00:13:04
<transcript>: i

00:13:06
<transcript>: I drive an electric car.

00:13:06
<transcript>: and my electric

00:13:08
<transcript>: And my electric car.

00:13:08
<transcript>: can normally

00:13:12
<transcript>: Can normally drive to can so do just fine. That's like the border.

00:13:12
<transcript>: of

00:13:20
<transcript>: Of our battery limits. We can drive the kins of city, and then we have to plug in a supercharger popup the whole thing.

00:13:27
<transcript>: This particular day trip. We were driving there in the morning. My parents were here watching my kids.

00:13:27
<transcript>: and so we

00:13:31
<transcript>: And so we had to drive there in the morning and then drive all the way back.

00:13:31
<transcript>: right

00:13:31
caasidev: where did you get that awesome neon from Adam?

00:13:32
<transcript>: Right.

00:13:32
<transcript>: on

00:13:34
<transcript>: On the same day.

00:13:39
cowfacedude99: Tesla?

00:13:39
<transcript>: I got the neon eyes. I think it cuts them. Me on fines or something.

00:13:39
<transcript>: custom me

00:13:43
<transcript>: Custom me on sign and stuff. I don't know calm. Something like that.

00:13:46
<transcript>: Yeah, Calfees, this is Tesla.

00:13:56
stroopwafel26: Hello \o/

00:13:57
<transcript>: A model X so it doesn't have like as long range as like the newer like the Three or the Y have longer ranges. The X is like older. It's a 2016.

00:14:00
<transcript>: It.

00:14:00
<transcript>: it does not

00:14:06
<transcript>: It does not have as long range in Kansas City is right there. Street is here. Hello, Stroop.

00:14:14
<transcript>: So anyway, we got there just fine. But then we tried to get greedy. And the supercharging there we tried to do.

00:14:14
<transcript>: like thirty minutes

00:14:27
<transcript>: Like 30 minutes. We probably should have been there for like 45, but like we had stuff to do. We had a limited time. We had 5 hours in Kansas City before we had turn around and get back so we could kiss our kids good night. They just would not handle going to bed without us. Very well.

00:14:27
<transcript>: so

00:14:29
<transcript>: So on the way home.

00:14:29
<transcript>: we're trying

00:14:33
<transcript>: We're trying to get home for their bedtime and.

00:14:37
<transcript>: We I thought I thought we had enough charge to make it.

00:14:37
<transcript>: we

00:14:39
<transcript>: We did not.

00:14:39
<transcript>: also

00:14:41
<transcript>: Also normally.

00:14:41
<transcript>: normally

00:14:42
<transcript>: Normally.

00:14:42
<transcript>: i'd like

00:14:48
stroopwafel26: oh no, a supercharger horror story?

00:14:51
<transcript>: I'd like ride behind tractor trailers, like big semi trucks. I get like, right upon them. And that really does help. I can just kind of get sucked all the way home.

00:14:52
cowfacedude99: You got on the electric bandwagon pretty early.

00:14:56
<transcript>: It's kind of a horror story. Yesteroo, it wasn't as bad. It could have been worse.

00:15:09
<transcript>: Yeah. Cafe. So I've driven. We've driven electric since 2013. So we've got a Tesla Model S in 2013, and we've driven electric since then. So, almost ten years, almost a decade.

00:15:09
<transcript>: of

00:15:16
<transcript>: Of driving electric cars. We also went plant based eating ten years ago. So we're celebrating like a day.

00:15:16
<transcript>: of all these

00:15:17
stroopwafel26: I tried a new v3? supercharger in Germany last summer, that was really nice

00:15:17
fragaverage: almost 10 years in electric vehicles, the world we live in huh

00:15:20
<transcript>: of all these like hippie green things

00:15:23
<transcript>: The world we live in I know.

00:15:23
<transcript>: yeah

00:15:30
<transcript>: Yeah. No. Ten years. It's crazy. That like there's been decent electric cars for almost ten years now. So anyway.

00:15:32
<transcript>: On our way home.

00:15:34
<transcript>: We.

00:15:34
<transcript>: we weren't gonna

00:15:38
<transcript>: We weren't gonna make it. It was very clear we were gonna make it. The problem is.

00:15:38
<transcript>: we have

00:15:44
<transcript>: We have no fallback plan if we don't make it to the north edge of Springfield, which is close to where I live.

00:15:44
<transcript>: the north edges

00:15:48
<transcript>: The north edges of Springfield has a supercharger, so we have to make it there.

00:15:48
<transcript>: or

00:15:52
<transcript>: Or we're just in real trouble, right.

00:16:01
<transcript>: And that's like 20 miles, 20 miles from our home. So like, we weren't even close to making a home. We had no shot. Right.

00:16:01
<transcript>: like

00:16:02
stroopwafel26: No EA charger earlier up the road?

00:16:10
<transcript>: Like I realized very quickly, we're not on pace. And then it was like, Can we make it to the supercharger? The answer that question is also no, we could not make a system.

00:16:20
<transcript>: So then I'm like having to frantically look on the charge point. It's like an app that has a bunch of these, like other Chargers that are really slow.

00:16:27
<transcript>: I'm looking for any kind of Chargers near us. And there happens to be 130 miles from the supercharge.

00:16:37
<transcript>: So we're gonna make it to that one. But the problem, those Chargers, they're, like, 15 miles an hour. A Supercharger is like 200 miles an hour. It charges your car really fast.

00:16:41
<transcript>: These like normal FEMA 150 or whatever they are.

00:16:46
<transcript>: You plug in like these public charging stations. And it's like a trickle.

00:16:46
<transcript>: so

00:16:52
<transcript>: So to stop at one of those to try and get the 5 miles we need to get to the supercharger.

00:16:52
<transcript>: is like

00:16:59
<transcript>: Is like 20 minutes. And by the time you stop and like we're trying. So there so we stop at this place.

00:16:59
<transcript>: we're not gonna make

00:17:06
<transcript>: We're not gonna make supercharger. If we don't want to get supercharger, we're just hose like we have note. We'll just die there on the side of the Highway.

00:17:06
<transcript>: not us

00:17:09
<transcript>: Not us die. But like the car will die. Right.

00:17:09
<transcript>: so we had

00:17:12
stroopwafel26: 11 kwh chargers are no good for travel :P

00:17:15
<transcript>: So we had to stop at this little place. It's in this little like I live in the Ozarks, right. There are some scary little.

00:17:19
<transcript>: Sketchy towns.

00:17:19
<transcript>: nothing against

00:17:22
fragaverage: Curiously, if you were in Kansas city for so long, why only do a 30 min charge?

00:17:23
<transcript>: Nothing against the people. I mean, it's just like there's no civilization.

00:17:23
<transcript>: it's like

00:17:29
<transcript>: It's like a town. There's a post office. And there's like, nothing. Right? So we had to stop in the little town. It's kind of creepy.

00:17:32
fragaverage: You were there for hours no?

00:17:38
<transcript>: We find this this public charging station. And we're gonna have to plug in for, like, 30 minutes to get to the Supercharger, to plug in to get home, right.

00:17:45
<transcript>: If you're in Kansas City for so long, why do a server? Yeah, because we were greedy, frag. We just had, like, a list of five things we went to doing. Kansas city.

00:17:55
<transcript>: So we didn't want to spend all this time just sitting there charging. If I would have stayed another five minutes at the Supercharger, all of this would have been no problem. But I didn't.

00:18:01
<transcript>: Yeah. So we're at this little tank. We plug in, and we both really have to pee.

00:18:01
<transcript>: and you

00:18:02
fragaverage: you stay with the vehicle?

00:18:04
<transcript>: And you all know how much I have to pee just for now.

00:18:13
fragaverage: UK folk just plug in and leave it going lol

00:18:18
<transcript>: You stay with the vehicle. Yeah, well, you just plugged in at the Supercharger in Ken City, stayed in the car we ate, actually, we picked up food on the way and bubble teas, and we like, set in the car while we were charging.

00:18:18
<transcript>: i guess we could

00:18:24
<transcript>: I guess we could have plugged in, but then the thing in America, Frag, is everything is so far apart.

00:18:24
<transcript>: so like if

00:18:29
fragaverage: Ah true

00:18:32
<transcript>: So like, if we leave the car, then we have to, like, Hooper, I guess so the things we want to do. But then we have to come back and get the car. It's just kind of like a pain.

00:18:32
<transcript>: so

00:18:36
<transcript>: So, yeah, we just stay the car. We charge anyway.

00:18:36
<transcript>: this little

00:18:39
<transcript>: This little town. We both have to pee.

00:18:44
fragaverage: We have superchargers in parking lots next to big shopping complexes

00:18:44
<transcript>: We're charged to get to the supercharger to charge to get home.

00:18:44
<transcript>: and

00:18:52
<transcript>: And it's all very depressing. We weren't gonna make it in time for our kids. Our kids had to stay up later so that we could see them before they would sleep.

00:18:58
<transcript>: Yeah, but we go to this little like it's a Mo dot Building. Missouri Department of transportation.

00:18:58
<transcript>: it's like the only

00:19:02
stroopwafel26: In The Netherlands almost every SC is next to a McDonalds lol

00:19:13
<transcript>: It's like the only thing within eyesight that has lights on. And there's these like transportation crew workers, like highway workers that are there late on a Monday night just happen to have the lights on this little office. And we're knocking on the door.

00:19:13
<transcript>: like excuse me

00:19:15
<transcript>: Like Excuse Me, Sir.

00:19:15
<transcript>: i'm dri

00:19:20
<transcript>: I'm driving electric car. We're charging over there. My wife really has to pee.

00:19:26
<transcript>: We come in. Do you have bathrooms? They did. It was weird. It was super weird.

00:19:29
<transcript>: I had to explain myself to like five different people.

00:19:29
<transcript>: because

00:19:32
fragaverage: Do you have bathrooms?

00:19:35
fragaverage: üòÇüòÇüòÇ

00:19:39
instafluff: maayaLOL

00:19:49
<transcript>: Because like, that guy looked in and we wandered through this maze to get to this bathroom. And then there's like, people washing off a truck, and they're like, hey, what do you guys do it in here? What's going on? What's going on? I'm like, my wife's in the bathroom. And then I have to do the whole story again, like, my car's charging. And they're like, we don't have a charger. I'm like, they do it's over there. I promise. I.

00:19:49
<transcript>: just felt like

00:19:53
<transcript>: Just felt like they thought it was a serial killer. I don't know. The whole thing was very stressful.

00:19:53
<transcript>: but now we're home

00:19:56
<transcript>: But now we're home. And it feels good. Do you have bathrooms.

00:20:04
instafluff: because you look soooo suspicious instafThink

00:20:06
<transcript>: It was just like a building. We're like washing off these, like highway trucks. Like trucks that do stuff on the highway. I don't know. It was just a lot.

00:20:16
<transcript>: There's a lot. I look so suspicious. I know I have, like my wife has her Fanny pack on. I've got my my high socks and my tennis shoes look like a pretty.

00:20:16
<transcript>: suspicious

00:20:17
<transcript>: Suspicious character.

00:20:20

<transcript>: this guy

00:21:04
<transcript>: This guy, the one the second guy that just saw a staining in the middle of their little office. And he didn't let me in. He was like, 20 questions.

00:21:05
<transcript>: what exactly

00:21:12
<transcript>: What exactly? We don't have him charger here. I'm like, I know you don't have a charger. I'm charging over there across the Highway.

00:21:17
stroopwafel26: curious what a serial killer would look like

00:21:20
<transcript>: He's like, Well, if you're using what? The bathrooms right there. I was like, no, my wife's in the back. I'm waiting for my wife. She's right there.

00:21:21
stroopwafel26: do they have t-shirts?

00:21:27
<transcript>: Tshirts.

00:21:27
<transcript>: i guess

00:21:28
stroopwafel26: "don't talk to me, I'd murder you"

00:21:37
<transcript>: Literally the blood of a Berry. Yeah. I thought I was about to be murdered. I should ask them the questions. What are you doing here.

00:22:57
<transcript>: That shouldn't be hard coded. Jay is here. Oh.

00:23:52
stroopwafel26: k8s is where everything went wrong indeed

00:23:54
<transcript>: That was sanity. I started playing with sanity. Someone stopped me.

00:23:54
<transcript>: started making

00:23:55
<transcript>: Started making.

00:23:55
<transcript>: a

00:23:56
<transcript>: A.

00:23:56
<transcript>: cms

00:24:01
<transcript>: Cms for my daily show that I shouldn't make I definitely should not make.

00:24:07
<transcript>: Let's see API.

00:24:10
stroopwafel26: @Andom is this an ultrawide humble brag?

00:24:13
<transcript>: What was it gonna do? Oh, yeah? The break.

00:24:13
<transcript>: so

00:24:15
<transcript>: So, oh, there we go, right there.

00:24:16
jaystation3x: well, now the client knows to keep paying you. Don't touch a thing!

00:24:17
<transcript>: Break.

00:24:22
<transcript>: So here this gotopos.

00:24:25
<transcript>: Go to pose.

00:24:28
nexxeln: hot take: you don;t need a cms as a dev

00:24:31
<transcript>: And I'm here.

00:24:31
<transcript>: just me with

00:24:34
<transcript>: just me with black bars on the side of the video

00:24:34
<transcript>: what

00:24:35
<transcript>: What.

00:24:35
<transcript>: black bars

00:24:36
<transcript>: Black bars.

00:24:36
<transcript>: on the

00:24:39
<transcript>: On the side of the video.

00:24:39
<transcript>: sounds

00:24:41
<transcript>: Sounds awful.

00:24:47
<transcript>: I don't see black bars, but.

00:24:47
<transcript>: i don't

00:24:51
<transcript>: I don't know I don't want to just sit where my machine? You.

00:24:55
nexxeln: no black bars

00:24:55
<transcript>: This link. Id. This.

00:24:55
<transcript>: is

00:24:57
<transcript>: Is not always a.

00:24:59
<transcript>: Maybe it is.

00:25:06
<transcript>: Maybe it is B. Three, one Apple Non paired connect.

00:25:08
jaystation3x: Just Larabars

00:25:10
<transcript>: Maybe it is.

00:25:12
<transcript>: No connect.

00:25:15
stroopwafel26: @jaystation3x it's true, i'll keep the quick fix I did yesterday in place

00:25:17
<transcript>: So the link IB is always the same.

00:25:27
<transcript>: Two, four. Oh, maybe I had to connect it. Oh, is there, like, a manual step here where I have to connect this thing every time.

00:25:27
<transcript>: oh

00:25:29
<transcript>: Oh.

00:25:29
<transcript>: interesting

00:25:32
<transcript>: Interesting. Okay. So now if I go to break.

00:25:32
<transcript>: fake break

00:25:37
<transcript>: Fake break not real. It's fake. I'm not really going to break.

00:25:44
<transcript>: Aha.

00:26:24
andom: well I do have a ultrawide LUL but the stream is in another half of the screen and I haven't had these black bars before @stroopwafel26

00:26:26
<transcript>: So that that was a noise. It made a noise that I did not like. It was like.

00:26:34
<transcript>: As it got up its track, like it got to a point where it was like, in it stuttered, like, shook.

00:26:34
<transcript>: that wasn't cool

00:26:37
<transcript>: That wasn't cool. I don't know. I don't break it, you know.

00:26:38
cowfacedude99: @jaystation3x the web lives on quickfixes LUL

00:26:41
fragaverage: @Andom looks fine on my UW

00:26:41
<transcript>: Don't want to break it.

00:26:41
<transcript>: hot

00:26:50
<transcript>: Hot take you don't need a CMS as a Dev. You know I thought so too. Next. I guess the reason I thought I wanted it was just for easier image.

00:26:50
<transcript>: uploading

00:26:53
<transcript>: Uploading. Like if I just want to like, drag images.

00:27:01
<transcript>: Usually I have a data folder. Like in every project I just have a bunch of markdown files. That's typically how I do stuff.

00:27:08
stroopwafel26: I get black bars when I full screen my browser on my UW, try resizing :P

00:27:14
<transcript>: But just the images, the images are always a pain, like I have to move them into some folder and then reference them with a path. I thought, like if I use sanity, I could just like, drag images, write some text.

00:27:14
<transcript>: and then

00:27:19
<transcript>: And then I'd be happy with it. I don't know. And I've just heard a lot of people like sanity.

00:27:19
<transcript>: do people like

00:27:22
<transcript>: Do people like sanity? Did I make that up.

00:27:24
fragaverage: I doi

00:27:25
<transcript>: Anybody.

00:27:27
<transcript>: Maybe like sanity.

00:27:34
<transcript>: No black bars for frag.

00:27:38
<transcript>: I get black bars when I full screen my browser.

00:27:38
<transcript>: try

00:27:40
<transcript>: Try resizing.

00:27:43
<transcript>: Okay.

00:27:43
<transcript>: so i

00:27:44
nexxeln: sanity is nice

00:27:46
stroopwafel26: sanity? don't know what you're talking about

00:27:56
<transcript>: So I don't need to fix the thing. I didn't need to fix just the camera made an awful camera. The mechanical jib made an awful noise. And I didn't love it. But I also just kind of like, don't want to mess with it right now.

00:28:01
<transcript>: So let's do something else. Aw. Guess we start at it.

00:28:01
<transcript>: and

00:28:07
<transcript>: And it's awful. Like it's objectively, terrible topic.

00:28:10
<transcript>: Picking back up.

00:28:10
andom: yeah it was just broken browser

00:28:12

instafluff: oh yeah drinking water out of a giant bowl was great but i had to pee a lot

00:34:06
<transcript>: There are three main ways you can interact with tmux. One command mode. So that's a colon. Right. Two, just do tmux command RGS and via Keymax. So number two was just do tmux. And then the command they are. Oh, okay. So from, like a blank.

00:34:14
<transcript>: Thing from like a non in tmux thing. I can do tmux command arguments and it'll do okay.

00:34:55
<transcript>: can't reach the data

00:34:55
nexxeln: akawrDrink

00:34:57
<transcript>: Can't reach the database server. That's one issue.

00:35:00
<transcript>: It's not the issue out of thinking of.

00:35:00
<transcript>: this

00:35:01
<transcript>: This issue.

00:35:01
<transcript>: is a

00:35:04
<transcript>: Is a piececale.

00:35:04
<transcript>: esc

00:35:05
<transcript>: Escale on, now.

00:35:09
<transcript>: Where's my own now I don't know what it is.

00:35:11
<transcript>: Escale, there's.

00:35:16
<transcript>: Dip back in the fish for a SEC.

00:35:25
<transcript>: Okay.

00:35:26
dyalicode: tilix is another terminal and u don t need tmux because give all features of tabs/sessions ..etc

00:35:32
<transcript>: Preschool connect AW Guests Main Port 3309 so this is live.

00:35:32
<transcript>: i

00:35:33
stroopwafel26: I bought a new iPhone but it had a stuck pixel flashing blue so I had to go back to get it replaced ugh, my entire morning up in smokes

00:35:35
<transcript>: I don't recommend it, but eight of you get.

00:35:37
<transcript>: On the internet.

00:35:37
<transcript>: on the web

00:35:41
<transcript>: On the Web every button has a disabled cursor.

00:35:54
<transcript>: Like don't click me, but they actually work. If you click on them, just ignore it. It actually works. And that is IQ. And the styling is bad. Everything basically about it is bad, but it works.

00:35:54
<transcript>: and now we're gonna make

00:36:00
<transcript>: And now we're gonna make it less bad that's pinpoint pinpoint API's you bet to.

00:36:10
<transcript>: Okay till X is another terminal and you don't need tmux because it gives all features of tabs sessions, et cetera.

00:36:10
<transcript>: oh it's

00:36:16
<transcript>: Oh, it's so it's like an emulator. So instead of alacrity, I would use tillyx.

00:36:16
<transcript>: anybody

00:36:18
<transcript>: Anybody use telex.

00:36:18
<transcript>: i bought a new iphone

00:36:21
cowfacedude99: something like kitty?

00:36:24
<transcript>: I bought a new iphone but it has stuck Pixel flashing blue so I had to go back to get it replaced. Ew.

00:36:30
<transcript>: Yeah, it's till it's like Kitty.

00:36:30
<transcript>: or

00:36:32
<transcript>: Or eye. Term.

00:36:37
<transcript>: Okay, now, we should have a database. Right.

00:36:41
<transcript>: Should be able to connect to the production database. There it is.

00:36:48
<transcript>: All right? So we need to fix so much? There's so many things we need to fix? I'm wondering.

00:36:48
<transcript>: how do i

00:36:55
<transcript>: How do I want to fix the styling here? I want to make all the buttons the same height. I want to not make them disabled. That'd be a good feature.

00:36:57
dyalicode: tilix is more better that kidy ..etc

00:36:59
<transcript>: Buttons no longer say you can't use them.

00:37:06
<transcript>: Index. Okay.

00:37:08
<transcript>: It's all this.

00:37:15
<transcript>: Is all this. Oh, this was like we started using Zust end, and then we stopped these ex.

00:37:19
<transcript>: But I'm still I still think we need to use something.

00:37:19
<transcript>: to manage

00:37:23
stroopwafel26: I'm zoning out playing awguess now brb

00:37:24
<transcript>: To manage the game state, because it's just kind of a mess, right.

00:37:26
<transcript>: This is all kind of a mess.

00:37:32
<transcript>: We want to build a leaderboard we got so much to do I want to build Lee board. I want to build.

00:37:35
<transcript>: Like actual scores.

00:37:35
<transcript>: you don't get score

00:37:36
<transcript>: You don't get scores right now.

00:37:36
<transcript>: there's no time

00:37:40
<transcript>: There's no time limit on the whole thing. You just keep going forever.

00:37:44
<transcript>: But first, I really want to fix the styling.

00:37:44
<transcript>: because the styling

00:37:47
<transcript>: Because the styling is the thing that bothers me most.

00:37:47
<transcript>: i'm

00:37:48
<transcript>: I'm.

00:37:50
<transcript>: Going.

00:37:54
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:37:58
<transcript>: So button.

00:38:05
<transcript>: This one.

00:38:10
<transcript>: Things are the follow my.

<transcript>: I need to update all my.

00:38:27
<transcript>: meal

00:38:30
<transcript>: Meal them plugins and see if things are better.

<transcript>: When in doubt update them all.

00:38:35
<transcript>: What.

00:38:41
<transcript>: This one do my overlays what.

00:38:44
nexxeln: how is it better than kitty @dyalicode

00:38:49
<transcript>: Okay. I just. I want to.

00:38:50
nexxeln: in which aspects

00:38:50
cowfacedude99: something opens up quickfixlist.

00:39:04
<transcript>: Tmuk stuff. That's dumb. There we go. I want to close this buffer. There we go. Okay.

00:39:04
<transcript>: button

00:39:05
<transcript>: Button.

00:39:05
<transcript>: where

00:39:10
<transcript>: Where is the cursor cursor not allowed? True. That should be.

00:39:10
<transcript>: if dis

00:39:12
<transcript>: If disabled, right.

00:39:17
<transcript>: Or what should that be? Why would I have that just as true.

00:39:19
<transcript>: Seems wrong.

00:39:21
<transcript>: He's very wrong.

00:39:24
<transcript>: That would be if.

00:39:30
<transcript>: Let's see. Kirshen not allowed.

00:39:32
<transcript>: If disabled, right.

00:39:32
<transcript>: it'll just be honest

00:39:34
<transcript>: It'll just be honest disabled.

00:39:39
<transcript>: So disabled.

00:39:46
<transcript>: And then we're going to say, Disabled equals disabled.

00:39:50
<transcript>: And up here we're going to say.

00:39:50
<transcript>: that

00:39:51
<transcript>: That.

00:39:51
<transcript>: is disabled

00:39:53
<transcript>: Is disabled.

00:40:01
<transcript>: If I could spell disabled there we go. Kirsten is not allowed to disabled so that's true if this is.

00:40:09
<transcript>: Work.

00:40:09
<transcript>: it worked

00:40:12
<transcript>: It worked. The buttons aren't disabled.

00:40:21
<transcript>: Yeah, something opens up a quick fix list. I don't love it I don't love it just happened after I updated them all.

00:40:21
<transcript>: at some point

00:40:23
<transcript>: At some point.

00:40:30
<transcript>: Tillix is more is more better than Kitty etc. Okay.

00:40:33
<transcript>: I'm zoning out playing AW guess now.

00:40:45

00:41:37
<transcript>: we

00:41:56
<transcript>: We have fun over here. We build some stuff. I'm building AWS related stuff. Today we're building a game called AW. Guess you can play it right now if you want. It's terrible, but Aws.com, it's like AWS with its AW guess because you guess which service based on the image.

00:41:56
<transcript>: i

00:41:59
carles_96_esp: @FragAverage <3

00:42:03
<transcript>: I am going to reinvent. I'm very excited. Just. It's feeling like reinvent season. I know. We're still like.

00:42:03
<transcript>: what two

00:42:05
<transcript>: What, two months.

00:42:11
<transcript>: Away? But it's starting to feel like reinvent instafluff. You'll be there, right.

00:42:11
<transcript>: this every eight

00:42:14
<transcript>: This every eight of his employee go to reinvent.

00:42:15
lindavivah: Absolutely love this! Hahhaha

00:42:17
<transcript>: Or do some people decide against it.

00:42:19
<transcript>: You love this.

00:42:23
instafluff: D: maybe i should go instafAAAA i didn't plan on it

00:42:23
<transcript>: The part where I'm staring into your souls.

00:42:32
stream_kyle: Fancy new light since last time I was here.

00:42:34
<transcript>: You should go into Fluff. You didn't plan on. Okay, so some people at a Tobis don't go, okay. I didn't know. So when I was in College, I worked at Best buy.

00:42:34
<transcript>: in

00:42:37
<transcript>: In The Geek squad.

00:42:37
<transcript>: and

00:42:42
stroopwafel26: the introverts stay home

00:42:44
<transcript>: And when I worked at Best Buy, there was like the day after Thanksgiving. Everyone knows, in America, it's Black Friday.

00:42:44
<transcript>: and if you

00:42:53
<transcript>: And if you didn't go, if you didn't show up to work on Black Friday, every employee in the store had to work on Black Friday because it was just people lying up at the doors to buy PVs and stuff.

00:42:53
<transcript>: so if you didn't

00:42:58
<transcript>: So if you didn't come, you were fired. It was just like, understood that if you didn't show up.

00:42:58
<transcript>: on black

00:43:06
<transcript>: On Black Friday at Best Buy. Just don't come back. You're fired. Automatic. It's not personal. You're just fired.

00:43:17
<transcript>: So yeah. And there's no story here where I didn't show up and got fired. But I just I wondered with, like, AWS and reinvent, is it like you don't show up your fire. Just leave. Just don't come back.

00:43:20
<transcript>: That sounds like it's not the case though.

00:43:20
<transcript>: fans

00:43:24
lindavivah: It‚Äôs mainly for customers. AWS employees go if are speaking or working the event

00:43:25
<transcript>: Fansy new light? There's a new light? Oh, the Adam Devlite? Yeah, Yeah.

00:43:25
<transcript>: now yeah

00:43:29
<transcript>: Now? Yeah. My wife got that for me for my birthday.

00:43:29
<transcript>: but

00:43:31
<transcript>: But it took a while to get here.

00:43:31
<transcript>: my birthday

00:43:33
<transcript>: My birthday was in August.

00:43:42
<transcript>: The introverts stay home. Yeah, I would stay home. This is my first reinvent. I'm going to my first reinvent. It's the first time I've traveled in.

00:43:42
<transcript>: three years

00:43:44
<transcript>: Three years, I think.

00:43:44
<transcript>: since the

00:43:45
lindavivah: Love the light!

00:43:48
<transcript>: Since the pandemic, since I had excuses not to travel anymore.

00:43:55
<transcript>: Mainly for customers. They do this. Employees go. If our speaking or working the event. I gotcha Linda, are you speaking.

00:44:06
<transcript>: We're doing any particular work, like when you say working the event, do you have like specific things you have to do while you're there? You just hang out.

00:44:15
lindavivah: I am haha

00:44:17
<transcript>: I guess the last time I traveled would have been like 2019.

00:44:17
<transcript>: when

00:44:20
<transcript>: When I, When I was still at Stat. Muse.

00:44:25

00:45:04
fragaverage: Flying to Portugal this weekend

00:45:10
<transcript>: When I read cospeaking I don't know, because I'm on Twitch. Maybe the first thing I thought was cosplaying I saw. I thought you were saying I'm cosplaying I was like, what are you gonna be.

00:45:10
<transcript>: one of the

00:45:12
<transcript>: One of the AWS services that sounded awesome.

00:45:12
2dorkstv: morning, friends!

00:45:24
lindavivah: üòÇüòÇüòÇhahahah

00:45:26

00:45:36
<transcript>: Oh, Geez, I don't know where? Portuguese.

00:45:41
<transcript>: I'm so bad. I'm such an American. This is just such an American thing.

00:45:41
<transcript>: i was just

00:45:42
nexxeln: europe

00:45:44
fragaverage: Work is treating us to a long weekend away!

00:45:45
<transcript>: I was just four hour flight. Okay. You're in the UK. Okay.

00:45:45
<transcript>: four hour life

00:45:52
<transcript>: Four hour life, four schools, definitely in Europe. Everybody knows that, guys, it's not in South America.

00:45:57
<transcript>: Cosplaying. Is a native service that sounds like a lot of fun, actually.

00:45:57
stroopwafel26: US person doesn't know how to geography. More news at 4.

00:45:59
noctumsempra: Jajaja

00:46:01
<transcript>: I feel like Cory Quinn's probably done that before.

00:46:04
<transcript>: Probably.

00:46:09
<transcript>: Work is treating us to a long weekend away. Oh, really.

00:46:09
<transcript>: you're doing it

00:46:10
<transcript>: You're doing it for work.

00:46:10
<transcript>: that

00:46:12
<transcript>: That sounds awesome.

00:46:14
<transcript>: Here's.

00:46:14
<transcript>: how

00:46:15
2dorkstv: I setup your neovim dotfiles, @adamdotdev. nice stuff! Better than what I had :D

00:46:19
<transcript>: How geography? Oh, man, I've got the Wikipedia page up for Portugal.

00:46:19
<transcript>: oh

00:46:20
<transcript>: Oh.

00:46:26
<transcript>: You set up the Neoven my Neovan DA files. Two dorks. That's. Awesome.

00:46:26
<transcript>: i liked them

00:46:33
<transcript>: I liked them. I do need to figure out a couple little quirks that have creeped in in the last.

00:46:33
<transcript>: couple

00:46:34
sikmofo: morning!

00:46:43
<transcript>: Couple weeks. There's been a little, just a couple little weird things that I don't love. That's where Portugal is people. It's right next to Spain. See, I knew what Spain was.

00:46:46
noctumsempra: Brasil (which speaks portuguese just like Portugal people) is in South America. I'll give you a point in the middle of confusion (the idiomatic point :P)

00:46:46
<transcript>: I'm an American, but I'm trying.

00:46:46
<transcript>: i'm trying

00:46:48
<transcript>: I'm trying so hard.

00:46:50
fragaverage: *pleased face*

00:46:52
<transcript>: That's one thing you can't say you can't say I don't try hard.

00:46:58
stroopwafel26: At least you know Europe isn't a country

00:47:05
<transcript>: Oh, man. Okay, so let's make these buttons look less awful. They look kind of awful. The different height thing. It's a text is too big. It's just everything too big. I think it's all too big if it's going off of the screen.

00:47:05
<transcript>: it's probably

00:47:07
<transcript>: It's probably too big.

00:47:08
instafluff: portugal, home of port wine spethSip

00:47:09
<transcript>: Looks like it's smaller.

00:47:17
<transcript>: Looks like this. Bigger. So I can see what I'm doing. But the problem is I needed in desktop view. Yeah like that.

00:47:20
<transcript>: Let's see Where's that there's Text, excel.

00:47:23
<transcript>: So let's make this.

00:47:26
<transcript>: What do we think.

00:47:29
<transcript>: Text.

00:47:29
fragaverage: Do you need so much whitespace at the top (yes its blue, whatever)

00:47:30
<transcript>: Large.

00:47:30
<transcript>: is gonna be

00:47:40
<transcript>: Is gonna be that big. Oh, so I have the the thing the text above it is on a separate it's like in a span. So it's.

00:47:48
<transcript>: Size differently there's base. I don't think tech size is the problem. I'm starting to think it's maybe the padding.

00:48:00
<transcript>: Let's go back to Large. And then Where's our padding relative border? Two. There we go. Py and PX is twelve.

00:48:01
<transcript>: Aggressive.

00:48:04
<transcript>: A lot of padding.

00:48:08
<transcript>: Okay. Wait. So these are okay. They're in, like a flex.

00:48:08
<transcript>: they're

00:48:12
<transcript>: They're in like a flex grid, so that they're all.

00:48:17
stroopwafel26: bluespace

00:48:20
<transcript>: The equal width. Is that what's going on here? Yeah. So I need to let's click on this.

00:48:23
<transcript>: App flow. I don't know.

00:48:23
<transcript>: no

00:48:30
<transcript>: No. Manager console. The management console. How about that? Okay, that's what I needed. I needed one. That's taller.

00:48:30
<transcript>: i never

00:48:36
<transcript>: I never thought of the console as a service, but I guess, yeah, I guess it is a service.

00:48:46
<transcript>: Good morning, Sigmofo. Hey, did it get there? Did it did it arrive? Sickmo foe.

00:48:51
<transcript>: Today. The keyboard I shipped. Sigmofo should be arriving.

00:48:53
<transcript>: In Iceland.

00:48:55
<transcript>: Hopefully.

00:48:55
<transcript>: brazil

00:49:00
<transcript>: Brazil, which speaks Portuguese, just like Portugal people is in South America. Aha.

00:49:05
<transcript>: That's the that's the problem. That's why I got confused.

00:49:11
<transcript>: I hope that's why I got confused. That's a really great reason to get confused. I just thought that's why.

00:49:11
<transcript>: at least you know

00:49:14
<transcript>: At least you know Europe is in the country.

00:49:16
sikmofo: was trying to call the delivery guy, should be here today

00:49:21
davur_: no.. it's cause your american :P

00:49:26
<transcript>: Do you need so much wise faces at the top? No, I guess I don't like all this up here. Yeah, that's too much. That's too much. Oh, it's all centered. It's just centered on the page. I think frag.

00:49:26
<transcript>: blue space

00:49:28
<transcript>: Blue space.

00:49:28
fragaverage: ahhh okay

00:49:30
<transcript>: Should be here today.

00:49:30
<transcript>: oh

00:49:34
<transcript>: Oh, which you were trying to call the little delivery guy. Uhoh.

00:49:41
fragaverage: I was gunna suggest in this width the buttons might look better as a 2x2 grid

00:49:45
<transcript>: So remember the thing with the phone number where I gave them? I gave them my phone number. Has that been an issue? I hope that's not an issue. I really hope that's not an issue. I don't want them sending it back.

00:49:52
sikmofo: yeah I called them and made sure they had mine

00:49:53
<transcript>: Because I'm American. Yeah, I don't even know what you're referring to, but yeah, it's probably because I'm Americans.

00:49:59
<transcript>: Gonna suggest in this width, the buttons might look better as a two by two grid. That's a good call.

00:49:59
<transcript>: okay you

00:50:04
<transcript>: Okay. You call them, make sure they had yours. Oh, perfect, fantastic.

00:50:04
<transcript>: i've been a little

00:50:06
<transcript>: I've been a little stressed about that because.

00:50:06
<transcript>: the one

00:50:08
<transcript>: The one little wrinkle.

00:50:08
<transcript>: i didn't know if

00:50:10
<transcript>: I didn't know if it could bite us.

00:50:20
<transcript>: All right, so two by two grid. What do we think? Would a two by two grid? Let's just let's try it.

00:50:29
<transcript>: Out. I think if I didn't put him in a two X three grid, how would I want to fix the button height here? I don't want them to all have different heights. I could do justify.

00:50:34
<transcript>: That would be the container of the buttons.

00:50:40
<transcript>: Let's go up here. Let's see. So here's the buttons.

00:50:44
<transcript>: This would be in the container. We would say.

00:50:47
<transcript>: What would we say? Item Center.

00:50:53
<transcript>: Instead, we would say, Justify? Oh, here we go. Medium flex.

00:50:55
<transcript>: So that it.

00:50:55
<transcript>: horizontal

00:50:57
<transcript>: Horizontal and vertical navigation.

00:51:00
<transcript>: Medium. Let's say.

00:51:03
<transcript>: Medium.

00:51:08
<transcript>: Let's say justify items, justify. What would it be justified.

00:51:11
<transcript>: Stretch.

00:51:15
<transcript>: Sure. Evenly.

00:51:17
<transcript>: Am I trying to do here.

00:51:20
<transcript>: Justify.

00:51:23
<transcript>: Queen.

00:51:27
<transcript>: Maybe it's not justified. Maybe that's the problem.

00:51:27
sikmofo: it got held up for a bit in import as there was no price on it so they didnt know how much to tax me

00:51:33
<transcript>: I'm trying to, you know, I'm saying, oh, it's not item center. It'd be item, stretch.

00:51:35
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:51:36
<transcript>: So.

00:51:36
<transcript>: medium

00:51:38
<transcript>: Medium.

00:51:38
<transcript>: item

00:51:39
sikmofo: apparently they ended up estimating $100 so that's good LUL

00:51:41
<transcript>: Items stretch.

00:51:47
<transcript>: There we go. Same height. At least are the same height. Now now we can work on the two by two grid.

00:51:47
<transcript>: yeah i don't think

00:51:57
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't think they should go all vertical, like they are on mobile for desktop. That just feels like not taking advantage of all the space. I think a two by two grid is a good idea, though.

00:51:57
<transcript>: so

00:52:01
<transcript>: So what do we have? We have flex. And instead, we want to do.

00:52:04
<transcript>: Grid. Is that the idea.

00:52:04
<transcript>: yes

00:52:05
<transcript>: Yes.

00:52:07
<transcript>: Can anybody now.

00:52:07
<transcript>: so

00:52:10
<transcript>: So here, this would be a grid.

00:52:10
<transcript>: then

00:52:14
<transcript>: Then what else would we have to do to make it a two by two grid? We'd have to say.

00:52:16
davur_: How did you by the way get the list of services?   There are a few sources of services, and they don't all agree

00:52:29
<transcript>: Oh, I'm gonna have to pull up in the tail. Wind back the tailwind docks, tail, wind grid. I just. I learn about CSS through tailwind. I recommend it that way. I think that's the way to learn CSS.

00:52:38
<transcript>: It got held up for a bit in import as there was no price on it so they didn't know how many taxi. Oh no.

00:52:41
<transcript>: They ended up estimating hundred dollars.

00:52:47
<transcript>: The guy at Ups asked me the value for Customs. I told him.

00:52:54
<transcript>: I don't know. I mean, that's good that they didn't know the real value I got.

00:53:02
sikmofo: I guess they goof'd that up then

00:53:05
<transcript>: Never the list of services is based on all the service icons. I just like took all the icons and then.

00:53:10
<transcript>: We took the names out of the file.

00:53:10
<transcript>: of the icon

00:53:16
<transcript>: Of the icons. So there's some little quirks that like capitalization's wrong, and things like that. We'll fix all that later.

00:53:19
<transcript>: But that's how I did. I just downloaded all the.

00:53:26
stroopwafel26: @sikmofo while it's actually priceless because you got it from adam

00:53:28
<transcript>: All the service icons. Okay, so Flexbox and grid. Grid auto flow. Oh, is this new? Did they change this.

00:53:30
<transcript>: This feels different.

00:53:34
<transcript>: Grid, template, columns.

00:53:34
<transcript>: grid

00:53:40
<transcript>: Grid. Auto columns. I think I just want auto columns. I just want two of them, you know.

00:53:40
<transcript>: how do

00:53:44
<transcript>: How do I say I want two columns. Make them the same width.

00:53:46
<transcript>: Anybody know.

00:53:52
<transcript>: Columns, is it it's gonna be.

00:53:55
<transcript>: Grid.

00:53:57
<transcript>: Template, columns.

00:54:03
<transcript>: Okay. Grid calls to There we go. So what I'm looking for.

00:54:06
<transcript>: I guess this would be on medium.

00:54:12
<transcript>: Medium. Okay, that's something.

00:54:17
<transcript>: The space Y needs actually.

00:54:17
<transcript>: be something

00:54:18
<transcript>: Be something.

00:54:20
<transcript>: Let's try.

00:54:20
<transcript>: three

00:54:21
<transcript>: Three.

00:54:21
<transcript>: four

00:54:22
<transcript>: Four.

00:54:22
<transcript>: six

00:54:24
<transcript>: Six.

00:54:26
<transcript>: Okay.

00:54:26
<transcript>: and then

00:54:31
<transcript>: And then what else is wrong with this? Oh, there's so much wrong with this.

00:54:36
<transcript>: Spacex is six, and Y is six. That's fine.

00:54:36
<transcript>: item

00:54:39
<transcript>: Items stretch.

00:54:42
<transcript>: Going on here.

00:54:45
<transcript>: So big.

00:54:49
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:55:02
<transcript>: Why we're overriding with this full margin, top of 60 Pixel. That's fine. Why is that Elemental Live button so giant.

00:55:07
befree__: You can try gap instead of x y ?

00:55:09
<transcript>: Can anyone tell what's going on here.

00:55:11
<transcript>: The.

00:55:19
<transcript>: I think the two by two grid is a good change. Try Gap instead of XY OOH. I like that. Be free. Welcome to Chat. Be free.

00:55:19
<transcript>: coming in

00:55:21
<transcript>: Coming in with the tip.

00:55:27
<transcript>: Just like that. It's actually pretty price as you got it from Adam. Oh, exactly.

00:55:29
<transcript>: Priceless.

00:55:35
<transcript>: Okay. So instead of this.

00:55:35
<transcript>: let's

00:55:38
<transcript>: Let's do this medium.

00:55:39
<transcript>: Gap.

00:55:39
<transcript>: gap

00:55:41
<transcript>: Gap.

00:55:49
<transcript>: Yes. Now, why is that button? That first button.

00:55:49
<transcript>: is so big

00:55:51
<transcript>: Is so big.

00:55:54
<transcript>: And I don't understand why.

00:55:54
<transcript>: also

00:56:00
<transcript>: Also I'd probably want them all to be the same size even if they're the one in their row is.

00:56:00
<transcript>: smaller

00:56:09
<transcript>: Smaller than the one above. You know what I'm saying? Probably should we just do fixed height on all the buttons? I feel like then there's gonna be some services really long. Like we got a really long name.

00:56:09
<transcript>: and

00:56:12
<transcript>: And we don't want it to be that.

00:56:12
<transcript>: size

00:56:18
<transcript>: Size. I don't know. I just gonna like truncate. We don't let the truncate that could affect the gameplay.

00:56:26
<transcript>: Or do I need to do space wise. Zero. Maybe that's it.

00:56:28
<transcript>: We need to do.

00:56:28
<transcript>: space

00:56:30
<transcript>: Space Y zero.

00:56:30
<transcript>: for medium

00:56:34
<transcript>: For medium space, Y zero.

00:56:37
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

00:56:37
<transcript>: so

00:56:39
<transcript>: So Gap Gap works.

00:56:39
<transcript>: the one thing

00:56:44
<transcript>: The one thing about the four X four grade. It does create a kind of a weird effect with these drop shadows.

00:56:46
<transcript>: Like here in the middle.

00:56:46
<transcript>: there's just something

00:56:50
<transcript>: There's just something kind of funny looking about that, but I don't know something of the world.

00:56:50
<transcript>: the

00:57:06
<transcript>: The thing that does bother me is that these two are taller than these two. I feel like I want them all to be, I guess. Okay. So the columns in the grid. Can I make sure the Cot or the rows kind of make sure they're all the same? That's what I want. I want all the rows to be the same height.

00:57:06
<transcript>: how do i do that

00:57:07
<transcript>: How do I do that.

00:57:08
mjewl: Your head is the funny part? Kappa

00:57:13
<transcript>: Grey. Rose to.

00:57:15
experior: Hahaha

00:57:18
<transcript>: Seems to make sense.

00:57:22
<transcript>: So medium.

00:57:22
<transcript>: grid rows two

00:57:24
<transcript>: Grid. Rows, two.

00:57:26
<transcript>: Second.

00:57:29
<transcript>: Yeah. Look at that. We did it.

00:57:31
<transcript>: We did it.

00:57:34
<transcript>: Your head is the funny part. What.

00:57:37
experior: TTours we can't see it haha

00:57:38
<transcript>: My head is the funny part of what in the.

00:57:42
befree__: primeagenClap1

00:57:43
<transcript>: You mean on the on the thing. Oh, you can't see it. Oh.

00:57:47
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat, both of you.

00:57:47
<transcript>: or i'm sorry

00:57:55
<transcript>: Or. I'm sorry. I'm Julie, you're not welcome. Chat. Be free. Welcome to chat. Exterior. Welcome to chat. So I was just pointing at my face. Like.

00:57:55
<transcript>: oh

00:57:58
experior: \o hi sir

00:57:59
<transcript>: Oh, this is funny looking right here. And that's my face.

00:58:00
mjewl: adamdo8DealWithIt

00:58:04
<transcript>: I'm looking at this. Yeah. Okay. That's funny.

00:58:04
<transcript>: that's funny

00:58:05
<transcript>: That's funny.

00:58:09
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow shinrill.

00:58:09
<transcript>: schindri

00:58:11
<transcript>: Schindriel.

00:58:13
<transcript>: Okay.

00:58:17
<transcript>: So we fix some styling stuff.

00:58:28
<transcript>: We fix the thing where the button had this disabled on it all the time. If I click on one, is it letting me click on multiple? Nope. So that's working, I think.

00:58:34
<transcript>: Chime Voice connector. Now IoT things graph. Okay.

00:58:38
<transcript>: Did it. Let me click twice. I don't think so.

00:58:43
<transcript>: What is this? Migration hub? I don't even know. Emr. I was close.

00:58:46
<transcript>: Event. Bridge. I know that one.

00:58:51
<transcript>: That's Quantum Ledger database.

00:58:56
<transcript>: That is a Beaver.

00:59:00
<transcript>: What is it? Lumber yard. That's an awesome service.

00:59:00
<transcript>: what is the lumber

00:59:02
<transcript>: What is the lumber yard? Do.

00:59:02
<transcript>: that's

00:59:04
<transcript>: That's funny.

00:59:17
<transcript>: Snowball, maybe. Yeah. Okay. We need a score. We desperate need a score. I think this is good for the layout. It'll switch to mobile View right there. That's good.

00:59:20
<transcript>: Mobile looks fine.

00:59:25
<transcript>: So now I don't feel completely embarrassed by the layout of the thing.

00:59:31
<transcript>: Let's see. What is that? Serverless application router? Yeah. Okay.

00:59:34
<transcript>: I think next up.

00:59:34
<transcript>: is

00:59:39
<transcript>: Is let's do a score. You need a score. If you're gonna play a game.

00:59:39
<transcript>: you need to squeeze

00:59:40
<transcript>: You need to squeeze.

00:59:50
stroopwafel26: maybe add confetti

00:59:50
<transcript>: A game when there's no point there's no like how you did so we need a timeout. We need the little the bar back.

00:59:59
<transcript>: Add confetti. Maybe maybe had confetti.

00:59:59
<transcript>: maybe

01:00:00
<transcript>: Maybe.

01:00:05
<transcript>: Sink box. Looks like a think box. Oh, data pipeline. Okay.

01:00:07
<transcript>: Code artifact.

01:00:10
<transcript>: Cool, cool.

01:00:18
<transcript>: Resource Access Manager. Yes. Okay. Let's do the timer.

01:00:21
davur_: you could do a "streak"... like current streak, longest streak

01:00:22
<transcript>: So the thing we were running into a septimer, if I recall.

01:00:24
<transcript>: Our call correctly.

01:00:30
<transcript>: Fix all that get commit.

01:00:30
<transcript>: six

01:00:32
<transcript>: Six Layout issues.

01:00:38
<transcript>: Push it so that AWS. Comm isn't quite so awful.

01:00:38
<transcript>: so here's

01:00:41
<transcript>: So here's the timer bar. And the problem we were running into.

01:00:44
<transcript>: Problem is.

01:00:46
<transcript>: That.

01:00:48
<transcript>: We were.

01:00:58
<transcript>: Cycle. That was bad.

01:01:05
<transcript>: News round.

01:01:07
<transcript>: Of game state.

01:01:09
<transcript>: I.

01:01:11
<transcript>: Answer.

01:01:11
<transcript>: set ch

01:01:13
<transcript>: Set choice.

01:01:27
<transcript>: New round.

01:01:33
<transcript>: Okay, so that just I delete it all of the state management for the.

01:01:37
<transcript>: Interval and everything, didn't I.

01:01:46
<transcript>: We were definitely running into issues, and I it was enough issues that I thought we should move to ZUSTAND or X state.

01:01:46
<transcript>: or something

01:01:50
<transcript>: Or something. Oh, yeah, we're definitely doing street stabber.

01:01:50
<transcript>: definitely

01:01:52
<transcript>: Definitely doing.

01:01:57
<transcript>: Like you get extra points as you get a streak like I'm multiplier or something.

01:02:00
<transcript>: We're gonna do that for sure.

01:02:09
<transcript>: So I'm gonna get the timer working.

01:02:14
<transcript>: We talked about just doing an animation.

01:02:14
<transcript>: like starting

01:02:18
<transcript>: Like starting in the animation for the timer and then stopping the animation.

01:02:22
<transcript>: Kind of like that.

01:02:29
<transcript>: It's been a week plus I wish I could remember.

01:02:31
<transcript>: All the lessons.

01:02:35
<transcript>: Nine points. There was some reason we didn't want to use.

01:02:41
<transcript>: The way the way we were doing timer was was not right and I don't remember what it was.

01:02:55
<transcript>: We flattened out the components.

01:03:00
<transcript>: No longer around component. There's just.

01:03:02
<transcript>: All rendered, and one.

01:03:07
<transcript>: Like it directly in the page. Except there's a button. We have a button capacity.

01:03:09
<transcript>: Which is fine.

01:03:12
<transcript>: Okay.

01:03:17
<transcript>: If I want to.

01:03:17
<transcript>: have this

01:03:19
<transcript>: Have this button.

01:03:19
<transcript>: we need to

01:03:23
<transcript>: We need to hat or this timer bar. We need to have the Elapsed tracked.

01:03:28
<transcript>: Oh, I had to leave all that code. That was so much work.

01:03:32
<transcript>: Figuring out the Elapsed percentage.

01:03:32
<transcript>: it shouldn't

01:03:34
<transcript>: It shouldn't been such a big deal, but it took me forever.

01:03:38
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:03:38
<transcript>: what i

01:03:41
<transcript>: What I want to do is.

01:03:43
<transcript>: Understand what I have here.

01:03:49
<transcript>: Set current round. Let's just log.

01:03:54
<transcript>: Current round.

01:03:54
<transcript>: so i know

01:03:56
<transcript>: So I know.

01:04:02
<transcript>: I know what I'm working with here.

01:04:05
<transcript>: Burnt round.

01:04:11
<transcript>: Has an answer which is just the image so that doesn't give away.

01:04:12
<transcript>: Doesn't give it away.

01:04:15
<transcript>: It's hashed. Then we have choices.

01:04:19
<transcript>: Which have.

01:04:24
<transcript>: Like the image. The name, the prefix. Okay.

01:04:27
<transcript>: And it expires. Is it date.

01:04:30
<transcript>: Which would be 10 seconds or now.

01:04:36
<transcript>: The game ID the round ID. And then the time that the round started.

01:04:36
<transcript>: yeah

01:04:38
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:04:38
<transcript>: okay

01:04:39
<transcript>: Okay.

01:04:39
<transcript>: so that's

01:04:41
<transcript>: So that's how we base our timer.

01:04:41
<transcript>: we

01:04:45
<transcript>: We animate from start to expires.

01:04:55
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:04:55
<transcript>: if i

01:05:00
<transcript>: If I want to do an animation, just a simple animation. React do I need a library.

01:05:00
<transcript>: do i need

01:05:01
<transcript>: Do I need one.

01:05:06
<transcript>: What are people using these days.

01:05:10
<transcript>: We did something with an animation library. Thank you for the follow. Karaoke.

01:05:13
<transcript>: What library did I use? I use.

01:05:17
<transcript>: Motion, no framer, framer, motion.

01:05:17
<transcript>: is that a thing

01:05:19
<transcript>: Is that a thing.

01:05:34
<transcript>: But I also think I don't need something like that just to animate the Progress bar.

01:05:34
<transcript>: react

01:05:37
<transcript>: React animate progress bar.

01:05:44
<transcript>: I don't need.

01:05:44
<transcript>: all that

01:05:46
<transcript>: All that.

01:05:49
<transcript>: A new Morphic Progress bar. What.

01:05:54
<transcript>: What is new? Morphic.

01:06:05
<transcript>: Morphism.

01:06:11
<transcript>: Also known as Soft UI or the Improvement of Skew morphism.

01:06:13
<transcript>: Highlights in the box, how properties.

01:06:28
<transcript>: How the animate? Animate.

01:06:32
<transcript>: You so much will follow architecture.

01:06:37
<transcript>: You know what if you're not following me once you follow me.

01:06:37
<transcript>: i don't know here

01:06:40
<transcript>: I don't know. Here. If you just ask people to do something like that, they'll do it.

01:06:50
<transcript>: And why do I want you to follow me? I want you to follow me. Because if you follow me, I assume that means you want to come back. And when you come back, that means I have people to hang out with when I work.

01:06:50
<transcript>: and i love that

01:06:51
<transcript>: And I love that.

01:06:54

01:07:26
<transcript>: Discover how to animate your act app with.

01:07:26
<transcript>: xyz

01:07:27
<transcript>: Xyz.

01:07:29
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:07:35
<transcript>: Animator Stroke using a stroke or Https pattern.

01:07:43
<transcript>: So I be doing this, like with something like an SVG instead of two DIVS with a width.

01:07:47
<transcript>: Is that not the way to do it.

01:07:51
<transcript>: I mean, I'm not building a circle, so let's just.

01:07:54
<transcript>: I.

01:08:00
<transcript>: Guess we could do like a square.

01:08:00
<transcript>: square

01:08:02
<transcript>: Square around the ice.

01:08:02
<transcript>: could be like

01:08:05
<transcript>: Could be like the Progress bar, but.

01:08:08
<transcript>: Let's see what's this one there.

01:08:14
<transcript>: I just want to start an animation and then be able to stop it.

01:08:17
<transcript>: Okay. So they did what we did.

01:08:28
<transcript>: Excuse me? It just feels like.

01:08:31
<transcript>: I don't know like a lot to be.

01:08:34
<transcript>: Setting.

01:08:34
<transcript>: state

01:08:35
<transcript>: State.

01:08:35
<transcript>: went to anim

<transcript>: Went to anime something right.

01:08:37
<transcript>: like

01:08:40
<transcript>: Like doing this. This feels like.

01:08:40
<transcript>: this feel

01:08:42
<transcript>: This feels like the wrong way.

01:08:49
<transcript>: Does not feel like the right way. Feels like I should just animate it, you know.

01:08:49
<transcript>: react

01:08:54
flowko: love the public.dev idea/website

01:08:54
<transcript>: React animate progress bar. Css. I don't know. Css animations. Does that make sense.

01:09:04
<transcript>: Today I want to show you simple, animated Burgers bar I made recently react.

01:09:07
<transcript>: reactive

01:09:08
<transcript>: Reactive.

01:09:08
<transcript>: so did they

01:09:10
<transcript>: So did they.

01:09:12
<transcript>: Actually animate it.

01:09:14
<transcript>: Or.

01:09:20
<transcript>: Did they do.

01:09:20
<transcript>: progress

01:09:21
<transcript>: Progress.

01:09:40
<transcript>: Flow code love the public Dev idea website. Hey, thanks, I appreciate that.

01:09:44
<transcript>: I'm gonna get back to it at some point.

01:09:48
<transcript>: I'm gonna be back to it. We were building it on stream for a bit, and then.

01:09:48
<transcript>: i got side

01:09:55
<transcript>: I got sidetracked and you know, it's kind of hard to get into a project and then get back into a project. It's like there's some inertia.

01:09:55
<transcript>: and

01:09:57
<transcript>: And.

01:09:57
<transcript>: it's just kind of

01:09:59
flowko: yeah i know haha

01:10:01
<transcript>: It's just kind of like not been the thing I've been focused on, but I don't get back to it.

01:10:06
<transcript>: I really want to have a better personal site and that's why I built public.

01:10:09
<transcript>: So very like Dev thing to do.

01:10:09
<transcript>: you need

01:10:14
<transcript>: You need to update your personal site. So why not build a site Builder to update your personal site.

01:10:14
<transcript>: seems

01:10:16
<transcript>: Seems like a good idea.

01:10:19
fragaverage: I forgot about public.dev lmao

01:10:21
flowko: sounds good to me

01:10:23
<transcript>: Oh, Daisy, thank you for the link. Here, let's see.

01:10:23
<transcript>: forgot

01:10:25
<transcript>: Forgot about voted.

01:10:33
<transcript>: Frag forgot about it. Frags here. Every time I stream. So that means I've not been talking about that's. A bummer.

01:10:37
<transcript>: This is a little.

01:10:38
<transcript>: Bit.

01:10:38
<transcript>: probably using

01:10:40
<transcript>: Probably using CSS.

01:10:40
<transcript>: i saw

01:10:43
<transcript>: I saw Jquery count and let's see.

01:10:43
<transcript>: i

01:10:45
<transcript>: I just need.

01:10:45
<transcript>: css

01:10:48
<transcript>: Css, React, CSS.

01:10:48
<transcript>: animation

01:10:49
stroopwafel26: @FragAverage you should get that checked out

01:10:49
<transcript>: Animation.

01:10:49
<transcript>: like a

01:10:52
<transcript>: Like a hook for this. I think there's a hook.

01:10:53
fragaverage: truth

01:10:56
<transcript>: I bet there's a hook for like animating.

01:11:00
<transcript>: React transition group.

01:11:10
<transcript>: This isn't a transition.

01:11:14
<transcript>: This is a.

01:11:17
fragaverage: Aren't you chaging width based on endTime - startTime?

01:11:25
<transcript>: How to.

01:11:27
flowko: its it open yet? or u need to register for something ?

01:11:27
<transcript>: Keyframes? No.

01:11:33
<transcript>: Should I be using CSS animation? Does anyone have opinions about this.

01:11:33
<transcript>: anybody

01:11:34
<transcript>: Anybody.

01:11:47
h4zard_fps: can you give me a Beta Key for public.dev please?

01:11:50
dnbull: KonCha @adamdotdev

01:11:54
<transcript>: Aren't you changing with based on in time? Yes, Frag, but I just thought like instead of having it as part of the render like in having state for like the elapsed. Should I not do all that react so should I just win a new round? Starts start an animation that's timed to hit on the expire.

01:11:54
<transcript>: and then i can

01:12:02
fragaverage: Oh okay

01:12:07
<transcript>: And then I can stop it. I can stop that animation. You know, I'm saying, seems more efficient to just like, run an animation rather than do set interval inside a use effect. You know what I mean? It just feels dirty.

01:12:07
<transcript>: i don't know why

01:12:09
<transcript>: I don't know why it feels dirty.

01:12:12
<transcript>: But it feels dirty? Hey, DM. Bowl.

01:12:16
<transcript>: Hazard. Welcome to chat.

01:12:16
<transcript>: yeah

01:12:20
<transcript>: Yeah, you can all test it just like this.

01:12:20
adamdotdev: !betakey

01:12:21
fossabot: Use beta key `adamisontwitch2` after signing up at public.dev.

01:12:22
<transcript>: Data key.

01:12:22
<transcript>: that still should

01:12:26
<transcript>: That still should be a command. There's your beta key. Adam is on Twitch.

01:12:31
h4zard_fps: oh thank you

01:12:32
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't know, Frag. I don't have strong opinions about this.

01:12:34
fragaverage: super secret beta key lmao

01:12:38
flowko: ah nice

01:12:40
<transcript>: It just started feeling hacked away, all my state was being managed and I thought maybe I just fire off an animation.

01:12:43
flowko: @FragAverage lol

01:12:44
<transcript>: And this would all be easier. Maybe.

01:13:05
<transcript>: Super secret? Yeah.

01:13:08
fragaverage: motion.div is probably going to be the cleanest, but I think you'll still end up with some state controlled stuff

01:13:14
<transcript>: Motion Div.

01:13:16
<transcript>: Maybe.

01:13:22
fragaverage: no, .div

01:13:23
<transcript>: Someone told me about this when two people tell me about a thing.

01:13:26
<transcript>: You need to take a look.

01:13:29
<transcript>: Now this looks like the API I'm looking for.

01:13:38
fragaverage: but also .dev, I guess lmao

01:13:45
fragaverage: the component is a <motion.div>

01:13:47
<transcript>: Okay, let's do it.

01:13:47
<transcript>: let's play

01:13:51
<transcript>: Let's play with it. It's nothing else. It's another thing I get to learn.

01:13:56
<transcript>: I'm all about learning stuff.

01:13:56
<transcript>: pmp

01:14:00
<transcript>: Pmpm install or is it add ocean.

01:14:05
<transcript>: That was easy.

01:14:10
<transcript>: So anime.

01:14:12
<transcript>: And you pass.

01:14:12
<transcript>: what

01:14:16
<transcript>: What a Class A CSS selector.

01:14:18
<transcript>: Or an actual element.

01:14:20
<transcript>: Oh, what about with react.

01:14:24
<transcript>: reaction

01:14:26
<transcript>: Reaction Dev with react.

01:14:42

01:14:48
<transcript>: What about react.

01:14:50

fragaverage: https://www.npmjs.com/package/framer-motion

01:15:01
<transcript>: Different package frame Remotion.

01:15:06
<transcript>: Oh, wait, wait, no dot Div, but also Dev.

01:15:10
<transcript>: Oh, Motion Div. Div is a TLD.

01:15:16

<transcript>: Let's try. Let's go back to frame Remotion. I don't know. This motion Dev, though. Looks kind of nice, right? They have a really nice landing page. That's what I base those most of my decisions.

01:15:48
<transcript>: on i don't

01:15:52
<transcript>: On I don't see that it has like a react API.

01:15:52

beardage: framer motion is sweet

01:31:19
fideloper: The times/dates are fuzzy

01:31:23
<transcript>: It feels fuzzy to me. Like just arbitrarily picking years and being like, if you were before, like, you're right on the line, you're either that or that, but it's just a year difference. I don't feel weird.

01:31:23
<transcript>: the time

01:31:30
<transcript>: The time dates are funny. Yeah. So our Fuzzy, I guess. Like, what do I think of as the Cutoff or millennials.

01:31:55
<transcript>: Pre 80s is Boomer, wait, no, no, wait. Frack, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. There's Jean X, as well.

<transcript>: So my parents are boomers.

01:32:05
<transcript>: baby boome

01:32:15
<transcript>: Baby boomers. They were born like the then my sister was born in 1980. She's Gen X, but she's right on the line. I want to say, like.

01:32:15
<transcript>: because

01:32:21
<transcript>: Because then my older brother was born in 84. He's a millennial.

01:32:25

<transcript>: okay

01:32:26

<transcript>: Fall apart.

01:33:52
fragaverage: bit shifting has caused more issues than Y2k

01:33:53
<transcript>: Nothing really fell apart, did it? Nothing really happened. It's like everyone had enough time to fix their stuff.

01:33:55
<transcript>: And it was all fine.

01:33:57
sargath666: 1983 here, we are also called as matrix generation

stroopwafel26: ATM's would start spewing money!

01:34:02
stroopwafel26: I wish they did

<transcript>: I don't know. I'm feeling very slow today. I'm recovering from.

01:34:16
<transcript>: what was basically

01:34:18
<transcript>: What was basically a day off yesterday.

01:34:27
<transcript>: Might have been the start of my dues day. Prep mine set. Yeah. I mean, there's lots of reasons these days. I don't know. I just heard some about.

01:34:27
<transcript>: russia moving

01:34:32
<transcript>: Russia moving a nuclear convoy close to Ukraine or something? Is that a thing.

01:34:32
<transcript>: so i just read

01:34:41
<transcript>: So I just read that in passing between, like, Kardashian updates. I swear. I just read that. I just saw, like, a Tweet highlight or something that was like.

01:34:41
<transcript>: rush is moving

01:34:45
<transcript>: Rush is moving a nuclear convoy.

01:34:45
<transcript>: across the country

01:34:46
fragaverage: shrugged it as "normal"

01:34:46
<transcript>: Across the country.

01:34:46
<transcript>: sounds bad

01:34:47
<transcript>: Sounds bad.

01:34:48
jamdotexe: I have heard likelihood is pushing up yea

01:34:51
jamdotexe: What can we do though?

01:34:52
<transcript>: Shrugged. It as normal. Yeah. Okay. Anyway, let's take a break.

01:36:34
vvanguard637: how important is computer networking in web dev or can we treat it as a abstracted layer and just generalize it as requests from a server

01:37:50
vvanguard637: and to your russia point US would do the same tbh if mexico was wanting to form a military alliance with russia/china tbh

01:38:04
vvanguard637: if we are being honest

01:38:30
vvanguard637: nearly happened in cuba

01:38:52
sargath666: @adamdotdev I wouldn't bother that convoy to much, it is just a another card in escalation ladder by this mental enslavement regime - they try to affect all of us to feel anxious, and to the point that the west will seat to negotiations - they won't gain anything with nukes

01:39:20
jamdotexe: Opened a can of worms there Kappa

01:39:35
<transcript>: I see. I started a conversation, then left.

01:39:38
<transcript>: We're talking about.

01:39:38
<transcript>: that conv

01:39:44
<transcript>: That convoy. So there is something to there is like a thing happening. But it's not a big deal. It's just.

01:39:44
<transcript>: theatrics

01:39:45
<transcript>: Theatrics.

01:40:00
<transcript>: Vanguard. Welcome to Chat. How important is computer networking and Web Dev? Or can we treat it as abstracted layer and just generalize it as requests from server. You can ignore it mostly. I mean Web Dev. I would classify Web Dev as being.

01:40:09
<transcript>: High enough level to not worry too much about networking. Now if you're building stuff, you could be building some for the web and have to care about networking. Obviously.

01:40:17
<transcript>: But I wish more and more people would not care. Like I think a lot of people build apps like Rails, apps and stuff, and they end up.

01:40:17
<transcript>: in the

01:40:21
<transcript>: In the weeds on networking when I just. I hate having to operate at that level.

01:40:21
<transcript>: of abstraction

01:40:23
<transcript>: Of abstraction.

01:40:23
<transcript>: but

01:40:27
<transcript>: But like some of the older frameworks, like that monolithic frameworks where.

01:40:27
<transcript>: you need to ho

01:40:29
<transcript>: You need to host it on something.

01:40:29
<transcript>: they tuesday

01:40:42
<transcript>: They Tuesday AWS. And then they end up with a V PC, and they're doing, like, private subnets for their database. It's just all that stuff. I hate it. I think in modern web development, you shouldn't have to think about networking.

01:40:47
<transcript>: And if there's a way to deploy your Rails app without thinking about networking, I would choose that nine times out of ten.

01:40:47
<transcript>: if you need to

01:40:53
2dorkstv: knowing how to "speak network" is pretty handy, I think. But not entirely necessary

01:40:54
<transcript>: If you need to worry about networking, you probably know it. You know, if you're not sure, then don't. You don't need to do stuff with networks.

01:41:05
<transcript>: To your Russia point, us would do the same. To be honest, if Mexico's Wayne Farm military alliances are actually trying to. If we're being honest, you're gonna happen to Cuba? Yeah, I'm not trying to.

01:41:05
<transcript>: defend the us

01:41:07
<transcript>: Defend the US for sure.

01:41:13
<transcript>: I wouldn't bother that convoluted too much.

01:41:13
<transcript>: is just another

01:41:24
<transcript>: Is just another card, an escalation liner. But this mental enslavement regime try to affect all of us to feel anxious. The point that the west will seek to negotiations. They won't gain anything with nukes.

01:41:31
<transcript>: That's the thing about nukes. Nobody really knows. We don't really know, right? We don't really know.

01:41:41
<transcript>: I don't know. I'm talking about stuff. I really don't know. But like, we never really know if everyone's bluffing until someone's not bluffing. Is that alarmist of me? But like.

01:41:41
<transcript>: it's always just

01:41:44
<transcript>: It's always just Bluffs until someone's not blessing.

01:41:44
<transcript>: and then we'll

01:41:47
<transcript>: And then we'll find out it wasn't a block, right.

01:41:53
<transcript>: This is not a stream where I.

01:41:53
<transcript>: opine

01:41:55
<transcript>: Opine on.

01:41:55
<transcript>: nuclear

01:41:56
<transcript>: Nuclear.

01:41:56
<transcript>: ge

01:41:59
<transcript>: Geopolitical implications.

01:41:59
<transcript>: knowing how

01:42:05
<transcript>: Knowing how to speak network is pretty handy, I think, but not entirely necessary. Yeah, I think. Like.

01:42:07
<transcript>: There are plenty of roles.

01:42:09
<transcript>: Where.

01:42:09
<transcript>: having

01:42:12
<transcript>: Having an understanding could benefit you.

01:42:12
<transcript>: i just think

01:42:17
<transcript>: I just think like when I think of web Dev and I think of the way things are trending towards smaller teams.

01:42:17
<transcript>: and

01:42:19
jamdotexe: Knowing is always going to be better than not knowing, that's for sure

01:42:29
<transcript>: And like higher levels of abstraction and serverless. I think you shouldn't. That shouldn't be a barrier. If you know nothing about networking, shouldn't be a barrier for you to get into web Dev.

01:42:33
<transcript>: devs more whatever

01:42:35
<transcript>: Devs more whatever. Here we go.

01:42:38
<transcript>: Let's do.

01:42:38
<transcript>: this

01:42:42
<transcript>: This thing. Let's animate this thing I need to make some progress.

01:42:46
<transcript>: I'm mostly not making progress, which is okay.

01:42:49
<transcript>: Mostly stream to hang out.

01:42:49
<transcript>: but

01:42:54
<transcript>: But let's actually do a thing. We made these motion Div.

01:42:54
<transcript>: that means

01:42:57
<transcript>: That means we can. Now let's pull up the docs.

01:43:04
<transcript>: We can do an animate.

01:43:04
<transcript>: i remember

01:43:06
<transcript>: I remember getting a little confused.

01:43:11
<transcript>: About all the different ways.

01:43:15
<transcript>: This works so like.

01:43:17
<transcript>: Motion components.

01:43:22
<transcript>: So there's animate and then there's like transition.

01:43:22
<transcript>: and yeah

01:43:26
<transcript>: And yeah, initial. There's a few different things you have to understand.

01:43:37
<transcript>: Origins. I guess we'd be animating the width of this Div right here.

01:43:37
<transcript>: so with

01:43:38
<transcript>: So with.

01:43:42
<transcript>: Wouldn't be this one up here. Right.

01:43:42
<transcript>: it

01:43:44
<transcript>: It would be.

01:43:44
<transcript>: so let's

01:43:46
<transcript>: So let's go delete.

01:43:49
<transcript>: To.

01:43:49
<transcript>: like

01:43:51
<transcript>: Like that.

01:43:51
<transcript>: yeah

01:43:52
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:43:57
<transcript>: Allows not a thing.

01:43:57
<transcript>: let's

01:44:02
<transcript>: Let's see. Green is nine. If Elapse is less than 100.

01:44:02
<transcript>: red

01:44:08
<transcript>: Red is nine of Elapse equals 100. So I guess to change the color.

01:44:11
<transcript>: To change the color, I will need to have.

01:44:11
<transcript>: an

01:44:21
<transcript>: An awareness like I'll need to rerender after the expiration, right. Or I guess after an animation ends, I can always be the way to do it. I guess.

01:44:31
<transcript>: Oh, so let me put my cowboy hat on. And cowboy hat not working so well on the green screen. I don't know what that's about.

01:44:36
<transcript>: I don't know I don't know I don't know.

01:44:42
<transcript>: A lap. So I guess we just need to calculate Elapse again. We're gonna need it.

01:44:44
<transcript>: You can still use animation.

01:44:47
<transcript>: What.

01:44:47
<transcript>: was from here

01:44:51
<transcript>: Was from here. Oh, yeah. Cuz we don't have a lapse. Let's go up here and just say.

01:44:56
<transcript>: Const elapse.

01:45:01
<transcript>: Everything for a SEC.

01:45:01
<transcript>: and then

01:45:03
<transcript>: And then Let's.

01:45:06
<transcript>: Fail to compile.

01:45:09
<transcript>: Main. Let's see.

01:45:09
laytanl_: Are you liking the t3 stack?

01:45:13
<transcript>: Jsx fragments? What did I do.

01:45:15
laytanl_: Or still to early to say?

01:45:15
<transcript>: What did I do.

01:45:18
<transcript>: Wait. What.

01:45:27
<transcript>: Actually an issue can I find name button.

01:45:32
<transcript>: I've got something.

01:45:35
<transcript>: Something bad. Wrong? Right.

01:45:38
<transcript>: Default.

01:45:42
<transcript>: Motion Div.

01:45:46
<transcript>: What do I do.

01:45:48
<transcript>: Ocean Div.

01:45:51
<transcript>: That Div. Let's see.

01:45:58
<transcript>: Motion Div.

01:45:58
<transcript>: nothing else really

01:46:02
<transcript>: Nothing else really changed? Let's undo let's go back here.

01:46:05
<transcript>: Here.

01:46:10
<transcript>: So here everything should build? Yeah. Okay. So.

01:46:16
<transcript>: If I want this one to be a motion Div, there problem with that.

01:46:26
<transcript>: Equals zero.

01:46:26
<transcript>: okay

01:46:27
<transcript>: Okay.

01:46:29
<transcript>: Now.

01:46:29
<transcript>: that's just

01:46:32
<transcript>: That's just saying it'll always return false. Okay.

01:46:38
<transcript>: My like in the T three SEC. Yeah. No, I love TrpC. Sounds great. I think.

01:46:43
<transcript>: I was having a conversation with DAX XRad about this.

01:46:43
<transcript>: and i

01:46:48
<transcript>: And I think I think the thing that I felt like I wasn't sure.

01:46:48
<transcript>: i was

01:46:57
<transcript>: I was not sure how maintainable part of this was. I think the thing I'm not sure about is actually verselle. It's hard to tease all this out.

01:46:57
<transcript>: but

01:47:02
<transcript>: But I think the like putting everything in an API route in verselle is the thing that feels like.

01:47:02
<transcript>: eventually

01:47:04
<transcript>: Eventually you'll outgrow. It.

01:47:04
<transcript>: you're gonna need

01:47:07
<transcript>: You're gonna need more control over your infrastructure.

01:47:07
<transcript>: it's not

01:47:15
<transcript>: It's not TRPC's fault, and DAX doesn't use next. Js. He uses TRPC, but he just he uses to your PC within an API gateway.

01:47:23
<transcript>: So he makes an API and API gateway and he's got Tier PC, I think up on a mission what DAX does, but.

01:47:23
<transcript>: yeah i think

01:47:35
<transcript>: Yeah, I think I just assume I lump all this stuff in. I'm like, oh, of course. You're building with Next JS. Of course you're deploying on Versaille. And isn't there something about this? It's not going to scale or not, not scale, but like, grow with your team.

01:47:43
<transcript>: I think it's for sale. I think it's just API routes. People building their entire product within API routes that feel a little like.

01:47:43
<transcript>: i'm not sure

01:47:44
<transcript>: I'm not sure.

01:47:44
<transcript>: but i don't

01:47:50
<transcript>: But I don't have like quantitative evidence that that doesn't work long term.

01:47:54
<transcript>: But TrpC love it fantastic.

01:47:59
<transcript>: Seems like a great great solution to.

01:48:07
<transcript>: Type safety in the end. Yeah, I love it.

01:48:15
<transcript>: Let's see, we.

01:48:20
<transcript>: We want to calculate a lapse up here.

01:48:23
<transcript>: We're gonna have to do this thing where we say.

01:48:27
<transcript>: Use effect.

01:48:34
<transcript>: And we're gonna do set, interval.

01:48:40
<transcript>: Right.

01:48:44
developmentrobot: I'm building my next side project in NestJS and hosting it on a good ole DO droplet, no headaches for me

01:48:45
laytanl_: Yeah I think Theo said that this will be good for 99% of projects and when you outgrow it you are successful enough to hire more people

01:48:59
<transcript>: Six, that.

01:49:03
<transcript>: Okay. So.

01:49:03
<transcript>: this is

01:49:05
<transcript>: This is where we do the thing.

01:49:12
<transcript>: And the thing that we're gonna do is set a last. I really don't like this.

01:49:19
<transcript>: I really, really don't like it.

01:49:19
laytanl_: I agree with you about everything being in vercel

01:49:25
<transcript>: That's why I deleted it all. We've already been here. Remember we were here once we're back again.

01:49:28
<transcript>: We're back again.

01:49:28
<transcript>: set elapse

01:49:29
<transcript>: Set elapse.

01:49:29
<transcript>: maybe

01:49:36
<transcript>: Maybe I at least don't need to have this. Maybe I don't need to have maybe I can just calculate a lapse based on.

01:49:48
<transcript>: Maybe when it's been a while since I've done something.

01:49:48
<transcript>: and

01:50:01
<transcript>: And I knew I ran into issues, and I got really upset, and I didn't like the way it was implemented. But then it's been a while. I think maybe I'll just do it better this time. Maybe I'll just go down that same path. But this time I'll do it right.

01:50:04
<transcript>: It's probably wrong. It's generally.

01:50:06
<transcript>: Not accurate.

01:50:13
<transcript>: Building my next slide project. The next day, I'm hosting it on good old Do Droplet. No headaches for me. There you go.

01:50:13
<transcript>: that's one way to do it

01:50:15
<transcript>: That's one way to do it. Do you find.

01:50:15
<transcript>: that

01:50:16
<transcript>: That.

01:50:22
<transcript>: Oh, nest, JS not next, but nest, I always confuses me so much.

01:50:22
<transcript>: i think

01:50:31
<transcript>: I think Theo said that this will be good for 99% of projects and then you are growing. You're settling up to hire more people. Yeah. I think the thing, the little.

01:50:46
<transcript>: Twists on what that sentiment is for me like my maybe not disagreeing with Theo, but my like additional cost on that is that I don't think you'll have to hire more people. I think the trend.

01:50:46
<transcript>: longterm

01:50:50
<transcript>: Longterm is small, small teams.

01:50:56
<transcript>: And small teams accomplishing more and more with more leverage. And I think that's what Serverless brings us.

01:51:06
<transcript>: So I try to just be a serverless truth or an here. But like I'm pretty convinced that's the way forward for most product development on the web.

01:51:15
<transcript>: Like serverless more layers of abstraction. US building on top of managed services that handle all the stuff we shouldn't have to worry about.

01:51:22
<transcript>: So in that sense, I don't know that you'll ever have to hire like it. I think like, startups.

01:51:22
<transcript>: will

01:51:42
<transcript>: Will grow to huge scale and never need a DevOps team. You know, I'm saying, I think that's the trans is like, you don't have to hire those people who manage infrastructure for you. Like, you have a small, very small team of engineers that know how to handle their own infrastructure because it's all very abstract away and very easy to work with using infrastructure.

01:51:42
<transcript>: 's

01:51:44
<transcript>: 's Codes and things like that.

01:51:44
<transcript>: anyway

01:51:45
<transcript>: Anyway.

01:51:45
<transcript>: i agree with you

01:51:48
<transcript>: I agree with you about everything being in Versaille. Yeah, I think.

01:51:48
<transcript>: like my

01:51:58
<transcript>: Like, my problem with Versaille, and I mean, they're amazing. Like they've hired everybody. And like, they're gonna figure it out, right? But my problem with Verselle is it does still feel like.

01:52:09
<transcript>: You'll make a comment on Twitter about like you know, it'd be nice if there were things other than just API functions. I don't think your entire backend can be expressed in API functions.

01:52:09
<transcript>: and

01:52:25
<transcript>: And a certain Dev rail will come into your inventions and be like, tell me what kind of things you think you need in the back end. And I feel like I'm an idiot being like, I don't know, Cron, jobs, cues, stuff that you need on the back end. Why don't have to explain this to verselle. Don't you guys know this stuff.

01:52:32
<transcript>: Like, tell me more about your use case. I don't know. I have back ends. They have needs. They're more complicated than just functions.

01:52:32
<transcript>: okay now

01:52:34
laytanl_: Yeah LUL

01:52:35
<transcript>: Okay now I'm getting all ranty I gotta calm down.

01:52:42
tjjone98: Hi, very nice font

01:52:44
<transcript>: I just feel like I'm like, I'm taking crazy pills. Like I'm the crew. I'm the crazy one that thinks that's not all that a backend is.

01:52:44
<transcript>: not to mention

01:52:58
<transcript>: Not to mention Verselle has no notion of like their own answer to like storage. I mean like everything on Versailles is like links to other services you can use to build out your back end, but it feels like.

01:53:01
laytanl_: I see that a lot with JS on the backend

01:53:02
fideloper: you're riling me up over here, i'd like to subscribe to your ranty newsletter.

01:53:06
<transcript>: They're not. I don't feel like they fully embrace. Like we're just your front end stack. It's like they pretend to kind of be everything you can build everything here.

01:53:06
<transcript>: except when

01:53:19
<transcript>: Except when you can't and then here's services you can use, which I actually fully embrace. I think that's the way forward in terms of serverless is like manage services. You might have your bolting together multiple thirdparty things.

01:53:19
<transcript>: i'm cool with that

01:53:25
<transcript>: I'm cool with that, but I just get this synth from Versaille that they still feel like they offer enough.

01:53:25
<transcript>: for your

01:53:34
laytanl_: Its all api's and for all the advanced stuff there isn't much

01:53:37
<transcript>: For your whole full stack application, like Next JS is not a full stack framework. That's I guess what I'm trying to say and I don't care about semantics so much. It's not about like, oh, that's not full stack. It's just like.

01:53:37
<transcript>: there's more

01:53:43
<transcript>: There's more to backends than functions. Okay, that's it. It's all I have to say.

01:53:46
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow hijack the engineer.

01:53:50
<transcript>: And also TJ very nice font. Thanks.

01:53:52
<transcript>: Operator mono.

01:54:00
fanieldanara: How have Vercel‚Äôs cold starts been lately?

01:54:03
<transcript>: I see that a lot with JS on the back end. Just oversimplification, I think. Oh, I'm Rilen Chris up. I'd like the Scripture subscribe to your ranty newsletter.

01:54:03
<transcript>: thanks

01:54:06
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow. Fabian.

01:54:10
tjjone98: yes, JS on backend, but difficult for scale and maintain

01:54:10
<transcript>: It's all APIs, and for all the advanced stuff, there isn't much. Yeah.

01:54:10
<transcript>: vers

01:54:13
<transcript>: Versus cold. Start. That's another thing.

01:54:20
tjjone98: move to TS in backend and JS in frontend

01:54:27
<transcript>: On Versaille is I really want to do maybe I'm gonna make a YouTube video about it. I'm starting my YouTube channel. Maybe I'm gonna make a YouTube video. I'm gonna go down like super scientific Binch marking of verselle against other things. But I don't think Versailles very fast.

01:54:27
<transcript>: i just don't get

01:54:29
<transcript>: I just don't get the sense that.

01:54:29
<transcript>: there well

01:54:35
<transcript>: There. Well, we all know no one uses Git Sergei Props because SSR and Versailles has been historically slow.

01:54:35
<transcript>: and maybe

01:54:45
<transcript>: And maybe that's not Versailles fault. Maybe that's react. Maybe it's whatever. I don't know. Maybe that's actually as not verselle, but like I don't know.

01:54:47
<transcript>: It's kind of the same thing, right.

01:54:56
<transcript>: And yeah, API wraps. A lot of things don't feel like they're that fast. I wonder how much of it is.

01:54:56
<transcript>: like

01:54:57
<transcript>: Like.

01:54:59
<transcript>: The framework versus.

01:55:00
laytanl_: I think we are talking about typescript when we say javascript @tjjone98

01:55:08
<transcript>: Just limits to the way they deploy the infrastructure. I don't know. I'm talking about things. I don't know. Now. I don't know. Enough about how Versailled does things.

01:55:17
laytanl_: When is your first video coming out

01:55:19
<transcript>: Yeah, we're talking about type script. I just assume I don't really ever think of JavaScript by itself without type script anymore.

01:55:19
<transcript>: that's not like

01:55:21
<transcript>: That's not like an elitist thing. It's just like.

01:55:21
<transcript>: i think you

01:55:34
<transcript>: I think you should use TypeScript. Think it's better. I think it'll it's not like I think it's net positive. You're not gonna spend so much time learning new stuff with TypeScript that you sold you down. I just think it's the way to build which I've.

01:55:37
<transcript>: First video was supposed to come out last week.

01:55:37
<transcript>: i

01:55:50
<transcript>: I lost last week to being sick, mostly my whole family being sick. It was less me being sick, more like everyone was sick. So it was just kind of a hard week this week. I'm not working much because it's my last birthday. So probably next week, if I'm being honestly.

01:56:04
<transcript>: I filmed a bunch of it, and then I just I started kind of playing with Postproduction and how I wanted it's like, I'm just I'm defining it's. Not gonna take me this one to make it every video. I'm just defining my style and kind of how I want to present information.

01:56:04
<transcript>: so

01:56:08
<transcript>: So there's a bit of early kind of curves, stuff.

01:56:10
laytanl_: Ah congrats!

01:56:11
<transcript>: Okay.

01:56:11
<transcript>: anyway

01:56:12
<transcript>: Anyway.

01:56:15
<transcript>: Congrats thanks.

01:56:15
<transcript>: yeah you mean

01:56:17
<transcript>: Yeah. You mean to my wife for her birthday.

01:56:21
<transcript>: Yeah. So there's my rant.

01:56:21
<transcript>: affiliate for

01:56:25
laytanl_: yeah

01:56:26
<transcript>: Affiliate for sale oversimplifies things and acts like there are no such thing as backends.

01:56:26
<transcript>: that your

01:56:28
<transcript>: That your API routes should be enough.

01:56:34
<transcript>: Maybe that's not just maybe that's just some people at Versaille. It's the people I interact with on Twitter. Maybe. I don't know.

01:56:34
<transcript>: but then i'll

01:56:35
<transcript>: But then I'll.

01:56:35
<transcript>: think it

01:56:42
<transcript>: Think it's very fast. Maybe the edge stuff. So now you can do like edge rendering. Maybe that's faster.

01:56:42
<transcript>: but i do feel

01:56:51
<transcript>: But I do feel like the cold starts are a thick thing under cell and I generally don't deal with cold starts anymore when I build on AWS, like I know how to get around those.

01:56:54
<transcript>: Anyway. Okay, let's move on.

01:57:03
<transcript>: I've written like ten lines of code. Today.

01:57:03
<transcript>: which is kind of

01:57:05
<transcript>: Which is kind of like par.

01:57:07
<transcript>: Par for the course when I'm streaming.

01:57:14
<transcript>: You think eventually I could be more productive while I stream it's like an aspirational goal.

01:57:19
dnbull: 10 lines of amazing code ;)

01:57:20
<transcript>: So, like, right here, I want to set a lapse, I guess.

01:57:22
<transcript>: Yes, we're doing this.

01:57:22
<transcript>: don't love it

01:57:23
<transcript>: Don't love it.

01:57:45
<transcript>: 's Number, then right.

01:57:51
fredkisss: maybe it is not so much about vercel's fault but JS & NodeJS, to do anything you have to install a bunch of dependencies and many things are not built in

01:57:54
<transcript>: Do the thing. Set elapsed.

01:57:54
<transcript>: and el

01:57:57
<transcript>: And elapse is what.

01:57:57
<transcript>: elapse

01:57:59
<transcript>: Elapse is a percentage.

01:57:59
<transcript>: of

01:58:01
<transcript>: Of.

01:58:05
<transcript>: Hurt round okay, let's see.

01:58:12
<transcript>: So the start time is current round dot.

01:58:12
<transcript>: start

01:58:13
<transcript>: Start.

01:58:13
<transcript>: and that is

01:58:17
<transcript>: And that is a date time. It's a date.

01:58:17
<transcript>: so

01:58:19
<transcript>: So it's possibly undefined.

01:58:23
<transcript>: So currently round we need to pass in here.

01:58:28
<transcript>: That's start.

01:58:28
<transcript>: end

01:58:29
<transcript>: End.

01:58:34
<transcript>: Expires is current round.

01:58:37
<transcript>: Current round.

01:58:37
<transcript>: exp

01:58:39
<transcript>: Expires.

01:58:42
<transcript>: Right.

01:58:49
<transcript>: We have start time. We have expires time, and we have the current time.

01:58:52
<transcript>: So current.

01:58:52
<transcript>: equals

01:58:55
2dorkstv: meeting time! later, party people!

01:58:57
<transcript>: Equals date. Now that would be a number though right.

01:59:00
<transcript>: Let's keep them all.

01:59:03
<transcript>: Let's see let's do.

01:59:03
<transcript>: new date

01:59:07
<transcript>: New Date. Let's give them all as dates.

01:59:11
<transcript>: Now, I think.

01:59:15
<transcript>: I think these are all dates. Right? Data. Undefined.

01:59:15
<transcript>: data undefined

01:59:17
<transcript>: Data undefined date.

01:59:17
<transcript>: so

01:59:20
<transcript>: So start expires in current.

01:59:22
<transcript>: I'm thinking through this.

01:59:22
<transcript>: why is it so hard

01:59:24
<transcript>: Why is it so hard? Why is.

01:59:24
<transcript>: so hard for me

01:59:25
<transcript>: So hard for me.

01:59:25
<transcript>: it's

01:59:29
<transcript>: It's gonna be the current time.

01:59:33
<transcript>: Minus the start time.

01:59:38
<transcript>: Divided by the total time so total time.

01:59:41
<transcript>: At total.

01:59:41
<transcript>: is going

01:59:43
<transcript>: Is going to be.

01:59:43
<transcript>: expires

01:59:44
<transcript>: Expires.

01:59:52
<transcript>: Minus start. And it turns out you can't do date math. Right? You have to say, like, get time.

01:59:55
<transcript>: Right.

01:59:59
<transcript>: You kind of like turn it into.

02:00:01
<transcript>: Numbers.

02:00:01
<transcript>: and those

02:00:04
<transcript>: And those are gonna be upset because.

02:00:09
<transcript>: Optional. I guess.

02:00:12
<transcript>: Okay.

02:00:15
<transcript>: So total.

02:00:20
<transcript>: Is what's wrong here.

02:00:25
<transcript>: Object is possibly undefined. That's why I put the question marks right.

02:00:32
<transcript>: Let's just think about this if there's no current round.

02:00:38
<transcript>: If there's no current round just return.

02:00:42
<transcript>: Nothing to do here. There's no current round.

02:00:47
<transcript>: rounds of

02:00:47
<transcript>: rounds of amazing

02:00:50
<transcript>: Rounds of amazing code. Thanks so much, Dmval. I appreciate that.

02:00:50
<transcript>: it's not true

02:00:53
<transcript>: It's not true, but I appreciate it.

02:00:53
<transcript>: maybe there's not

02:01:04
<transcript>: Maybe there's not so much about Versailles fault, but JS and node JS, you know, totally possible to do anything. You have to install a bunch of dependencies. Maybe things are not built in. Yeah, so in terms of C. A. Tudorcs.

02:01:17
<transcript>: In terms of cold starts. The reason we have cold starts. So if you build on AWS and you like make a big Lambda function and you push it up there and you notice there's like a 500 millisecond cold start. That's because.

02:01:17
<transcript>: your your

02:01:25
<transcript>: Your your function dependencies. Everything like the package is too large. The larger the package the worst the cold start.

02:01:25
<transcript>: so if

02:01:38
<transcript>: So if you can write a tiny little JavaScript file and that's your function. You want to have a cold start. You want the notice it at all. If you have a bunch of dependencies and it's a big fat node modules directory, then you'll have a cold start.

02:01:38
<transcript>: so

02:01:44
<transcript>: So I guess like if Versell is actually using Lambda.

02:01:44
<transcript>: for your ap

02:01:52
<transcript>: For your API routes and for your Get server side. I don't know. Maybe they're not. Maybe they're using containers. And then I have no explanation.

02:01:52
<transcript>: it's actually using

02:02:00
<transcript>: It's actually using Lambda. Then the cold starts would be because next JS is just big and like you're shipping next JS to your Lambda function.

02:02:00
<transcript>: i don't know

02:02:06
<transcript>: I don't know. I'm talking about stuff. I don't know. I don't work. If your cell. I don't have any inside baseball. About how.

02:02:06
<transcript>: they do their

02:02:08
<transcript>: They do their infrastructure.

02:02:08
<transcript>: thank you for the

02:02:10
<transcript>: Thank you for the following Matthias.

02:02:10
<transcript>: that's

02:02:13
<transcript>: That's where cold starts come from so.

02:02:21
<transcript>: I generally try to avoid them altogether by just writing VTL because I'm a nerd, so I don't do Lambda functions.

02:02:21
<transcript>: sam

02:02:41
<transcript>: Sam to functions. Those are so 2019. Now I'm just kidding, but I do write a lot of VTL, which is a terrible velocity temple time, which I'm not blaming Apache. It's not their fault. It's fine. It's fine. But the Dev experience is terrible when you're used like TypeScript and like awesome stuff in 2022. And then you write VTL and you're like.

02:02:41
<transcript>: just a string

02:02:50
<transcript>: Just a string like I hope this works but that's how I avoid both stars. There's no cold starts when you write VTL on AWS.

02:02:57
fredkisss: I was talking about vercel not having all the features and all

02:02:58
<transcript>: One inhouse thank you for the follow. I appreciate all the follows. You know what if you're not following me and you want to come back, you should follow me.

02:03:01
<transcript>: I'm trying this a little like ask explicitly.

02:03:01
<transcript>: for things

02:03:02
<transcript>: For things.

02:03:02
<transcript>: i don't know i saw

02:03:02
fredkisss: What is VTL ?

02:03:07
<transcript>: I don't know. I saw prime say something about how he asked people to subscribe to him on YouTube. Now.

02:03:07
<transcript>: how it felt dirty

02:03:17
<transcript>: How it felt dirty at first. And it does feel dirty. Feels dirty for me to say Please follow me but please follow me. I like it when people follow me it makes me feel good and it makes me think I'll see you again.

02:03:22
murrrrrphy: HeyGuys building my first ever app with nextjs right now and it's got a concept of rounds too. Will awguess be open source/viewable so I can lurk on your code? üëÄ

02:03:23
<transcript>: And I'd like to see you again. I like seawall. It's so nice having people here while I work.

02:03:23
<transcript>: i was talking

02:03:25
dnbull: Adam is a great guy with great content!

02:03:27
<transcript>: I was talking about versellum not having all the features and all.

02:03:42
<transcript>: That depends. These amazings are not built in. Yeah, it's hard to separate what is just like it's slow to render react on the server. What is that? Versus.

02:03:42
<transcript>: the way

02:03:45
<transcript>: The way you did the infrastructure is slow.

02:03:45
<transcript>: vtl

02:03:49
<transcript>: Vtl is velocity template language.

02:03:55
<transcript>: And you can use it in AppSync or API gateway to write like these Declarative templates.

02:03:55
<transcript>: that basically

02:03:59
<transcript>: That basically handle requests and interact with other AWS services.

02:03:59
<transcript>: so the way

02:04:05
<transcript>: So the way to not write a Lambda function and not have any runtime like.

02:04:05
<transcript>: you don't have any

02:04:10
<transcript>: You don't have any JavaScript runtimes spinning up or it's all like a Java thing that runs.

02:04:10
<transcript>: really fast

02:04:18
<transcript>: Really fast. No cold starts, no code rot. You don't have dependencies in your code that are getting old, that you need to update.

02:04:18
<transcript>: you just

02:04:18
dnbull: I started using tRPC last weekend - it's not bad. Not sure if I agree with the hype though

02:04:23
<transcript>: You just write a template. It's really hard to write, though. If you're not used to it, you have there's a learning curve.

02:04:29
<transcript>: And it's kind of hard to maintain because it's hard to deal with debug, like when you have an issue, it's hard to troubleshoot.

02:04:33
<transcript>: You kind of have to just test it against real infrastructure.

02:04:39
dnbull: but probably because I'm not a fan of graphql/apollo/nexus and I feel tRPC makes it a lot easier

02:04:46
<transcript>: Murphy building my first ever app with next to this right now, and it's got a concept of rounds too. Hey, well, AWS, AW, guess the open source viewable so I can lurk on the code. It absolutely is.

02:04:46
<transcript>: you can check

02:04:48
<transcript>: You can check it out right now.

02:04:48
<transcript>: at github

02:04:50
<transcript>: At GitHub.com.

02:04:50
<transcript>: adam no more

02:04:51
laytanl_: Someone needs to make a vtl transpiler that has syntax highlighting and intellesense

02:04:51
<transcript>: Adam, no more.

02:04:51
<transcript>: aw

02:04:51
adamdotdev: github.com/adamelmore/awguess

02:04:53
<transcript>: Aws, I think.

02:04:56
<transcript>: That's right.

02:04:59
murrrrrphy: üôèüôèüôè

02:05:02
<transcript>: Concrete content. Thank you so much. Dm. Bowl.

02:05:02
<transcript>: where would they come from

02:05:03
<transcript>: Where would they come from.

02:05:03
<transcript>: i appreciate that

02:05:10
<transcript>: I appreciate that I started using TRPC last weekend. It's not bad. Not sure if I agree with the Hype, though.

02:05:14
<transcript>: I mean, let's just kind of like tech. We get very high up about things.

02:05:20
<transcript>: Tierpz definitely went on, like a hockey stick ride, right? Just kind of, like took off.

02:05:26
<transcript>: Probably because I'm not a fan of Grabfeel Apollo Nexus, and I feel TrpC makes it a lot easier.

02:05:30
<transcript>: That this.

02:05:35
murrrrrphy: TY! Mine's going to be a multiplayer pitch n' putt scorecard tracker so I need to figure out how to handle moving through each hole on the course for each player.

02:05:39
<transcript>: Someone needs to make a VTL transpiler that has syntaxilian and intelligence. Guess what, lightened? Guess what someone did. It's called functionless. Same good one.

02:05:39
<transcript>: function

02:05:41
<transcript>: Function less.

02:05:46
<transcript>: This is it. They did. Someone did it.

02:05:46
<transcript>: function

02:05:48
<transcript>: Functionless. There you go.

02:05:49
texoport: @dnbull I rewrote a huge SaaS platform from graphql to tRPC and it's the best decision I ever made

02:05:53
<transcript>: And also it's coming to AppSync.

02:05:53
<transcript>: so app

02:05:59
<transcript>: So app sync is gonna have TypeScript to VTL transportation builtin to the service.

02:06:00
laytanl_: ooh

02:06:02
<transcript>: Can't wait, can't wait.

02:06:09
laytanl_: Thats sick

02:06:14
<transcript>: Thank you. Mine's going to be a multiplayer pitch and pipe scorecard tracker, so I need to figure out how to handle moving through each hole in the course for each wire. That's awesome. Murphy. I think we're solving some of the same problems dealing with some of the same stuff.

02:06:20
dnbull: @texoport I can see that! We have a default template at work and we have an RFC to change to tRPC. I hope it goes through :)

02:06:21
<transcript>: I rewrote a huge SAS platform from GraphQL to TrpC and decision I ever made.

02:06:25
zachrip: disc golf?

02:06:26
<transcript>: I mean, it is definitely less to think about, like.

02:06:33
<transcript>: Easier to get type safety. I will say I've had type safety on the backend like from back for forever.

02:06:52
<transcript>: That's not new. It's just less. It's like less to deal with. So I use graphical code generator. You got to set up like, all that and the rules and how you want to define your types out of that. And you got to like, import them into your front. Like, there's just more steps to get your full type safety with GraphQL.

02:07:03
<transcript>: But very possible. And I don't know I haven't used TrpC enough to know, like, are there points where I'm like, oh, I wish I could do GraphQL here and I would have more flexibility. I just don't know yet.

02:07:03
<transcript>: i'm not used

02:07:05
<transcript>: I'm not used it enough.

02:07:14
<transcript>: I can see that we have a default template at work. We have an RMC to change the TRPC hope it goes through.

02:07:16
<transcript>: All right.

02:07:16
<transcript>: function

02:07:18
texoport: It's not just the type safety, honestly. Complex rule/role based access and things like that are so much easier with tRPC as opposed to graphql

02:07:21
<transcript>: Functionless is done some work on their website and it's awesome.

02:07:21
<transcript>: start

02:07:25
<transcript>: Starts on GitHub have I start functionless? Yeah, I have.

02:07:25
<transcript>: ghost

02:07:28
<transcript>: Ghost go star function list get Sam a boost.

02:07:28
<transcript>: he's doing

02:07:30
<transcript>: He's doing good work.

02:07:37
<transcript>: Yeah. You basically write TypeScript. You get VTL.

02:07:38
dnbull: @texoport lets just agree that graphql is a mistake Kappa Kappa

02:07:44
<transcript>: Which is like really performant. So for the nerds who really care about.

02:08:00
<transcript>: Your like your cold starts and just how snappy is your API. I don't think you're gonna get any faster than like an absent API with BTL template. I guess if you were doing like Wazam at the edge with rust.

02:08:00
<transcript>: probably

02:08:02
<transcript>: Probably faster.

02:08:04
<transcript>: Also.

02:08:04
<transcript>: way worse

02:08:12
<transcript>: Way worse. Devx. Even I would think. I don't know. I haven't played with that. I should play with that. We should play with that on stream.

02:08:12
<transcript>: like what

02:08:14
<transcript>: Like what is the developer experience? Like.

02:08:14
<transcript>: for like

02:08:14
laytanl_: What does aws do with the vtl source that makes it so performant

02:08:17
<transcript>: For like rust at the edge.

02:08:17
<transcript>: is it good

02:08:21
<transcript>: Is it good? I don't even know it might be good.

02:08:36
<transcript>: Not just the type, safety, honestly, complex rule, rolebased access and things like that are so much easier with the RPC as opposed to GraphQL. Yeah. I think the thing about GraphQL is it's like, like, what flavor of graph could.

02:08:36
<transcript>: like

02:08:40
<transcript>: Like Are you rolling your own Apollo server.

02:08:40
<transcript>: that

02:08:44
<transcript>: That sounds bad. I don't want to do that.

02:08:44
<transcript>: but if you

02:08:49
<transcript>: But if you use App Sync, I like fine grain access controls. Pretty like.

02:08:49
<transcript>: pretty easy

02:08:53
<transcript>: Pretty easy on AppSync. I mean, I'm used to it. So I say that. But.

02:09:00
<transcript>: And I'm not as familiar with your PC, so I can't really have this conversation just I don't know the trade off that well.

02:09:00
<transcript>: once i've

02:09:06
<transcript>: Once I've built out more of AW, guess and we've gotten into some, like, off and all that kind of stuff.

02:09:06
<transcript>: i'll have more

02:09:08
<transcript>: I'll have more opinions.

02:09:12
<transcript>: Let's just agree that GraphQL is a mistake.

02:09:16
<transcript>: What does idea is do with the retail source that makes it so performant.

02:09:16
<transcript>: it's not that they

02:09:20
<transcript>: It's not that they do something with it. I don't think it's just that.

02:09:23
<transcript>: If the alternative is.

02:09:23
<transcript>: dep

02:09:24
<transcript>: Deploying.

02:09:24
<transcript>: in a lambda

02:09:26
<transcript>: In a Lambda function.

02:09:26
<transcript>: it

02:09:31
<transcript>: It's just a lot faster. They've just got this job. A runtime.

02:09:39
<transcript>: Okay. So AppSync has this Java runtime and they're just running against the template. So they're not having to.

02:09:39
<transcript>: do the

02:09:42
<transcript>: Do the whole Lambda thing.

02:10:00
<transcript>: Which the reason they're a cold starts is they have to like provision the underlying infrastructure to serve that request right? So they have to load all your code and copy it over to this new thing, whatever it is, I don't know how they do Lambda, firecracker or something. Virtual machine.

02:10:02
texoport: is that similar to what Cloudflare Workers does with JS?

02:10:14
<transcript>: But they have to, like, copy all. So if you've got this giant Node Modules folder because you built like a huge Express app, and you deploy it into Lambda, all that stuff has to be copied into this environment where it can run your code. And that's the cold start, right.

02:10:14
<transcript>: there is

02:10:23
<transcript>: There is none of that. When you're doing a VTL template, it's like a two kilobyte text file that they just run your thing again. Run your request against that template.

02:10:39
<transcript>: So it's just inherently faster because there's a lot less like you can't have dependencies with a VTL template. There's no way to like pile in a bunch of code. You don't need to slow things down. It's really just volume of code. Just imagine, like when you don't deploy a thing to Versaille.

02:10:39
<transcript>: the volume

02:10:44
<transcript>: The volume of stuff involved at runtime in your function.

02:10:44
<transcript>: that's

02:10:49
<transcript>: That's what's going to make for cold starts. It's really not complicated. It's just like.

02:10:49
<transcript>: physics

02:10:53
<transcript>: Physics like we gotta move all this.

02:10:53
<transcript>: block of

02:10:54
laytanl_: ah makes sense

02:10:54
<transcript>: Block of stuff.

02:10:54
<transcript>: into

02:10:58
<transcript>: Into an environment where we can run your code against it.

02:10:58
<transcript>: as a function

02:11:00
<transcript>: As a function, as a service or whatever.

02:11:00
<transcript>: the

02:11:15
<transcript>: The more stuff you have to move, the slower and the longer that takes. And with VTL, you're just kind of forced to write this very obtuse document, but you can't import a bunch of libraries and stuff you just can't. So you write like a tiny little if you could write.

02:11:15
<transcript>: a javascript

02:11:25
<transcript>: A JavaScript Lambda function that's just a single file. It doesn't have any dependencies that'll be fast too. And then the differences between that and retailer negligible. Does that make sense.

02:11:25
<transcript>: ah makes sense

02:11:29
<transcript>: Ah makes sense. I asked if it made sense. You had already answered that it makes sense.

02:11:33
<transcript>: Is that similar to what cloud or workers does.

02:11:33
<transcript>: i think so

02:11:40
laytanl_: not having dependencies means the vtl will have to talk to some service outside, doesn't it, for more advanced stuff?

02:11:52
fredkisss: If i understand correctly VTL is a prepared environnement where your code is run against ?

02:11:53
<transcript>: I think so. Textoplay Port. I don't play with Cloudflare workers much. That's another thing that's high on my list of, like, infrastructure I want to play with is like the cloud player serverless stuff that's going on. They just did queues. They're starting to piece together more of the puzzle. It still bothers me. There's no infrastructure as code. It'd be hard for me. And I don't like, I'm not gonna use.

02:11:57
<transcript>: The thing. I'm not gonna use TerraForm.

02:11:57
<transcript>: so don't

02:12:00
<transcript>: So don't say you can use TerraForm. I'm not gonna eat term.

02:12:00
<transcript>: if

02:12:01
zachrip: There's a lot of hidden complexity in graphql as well. You can use dataloader for some of the time complexity, but there is also complexity especially in nested relationships where you're encouraged to create separate types, but some of them depend on parent metadata, etc. I'm starting to think the best really is just rpc with flat relationships, etc.

02:12:04
<transcript>: If there were a built in if you're structures code in the Cloudflare I'd use it today.

02:12:04
<transcript>: the fact that

02:12:13
<transcript>: The fact that you're still kind of like without that, it's just hard for me to imagine building something on it, but I do want to play with it, at least, like in the lab.

02:12:22
<transcript>: Not having dependencies means the VTL will have to talk to some service outside, doesn't it? Yeah. So that's all the VTL is doing. Like when I build.

02:12:22
<transcript>: ap

02:12:23
fanieldanara: I know WASM is becoming really popular, I wonder if you can compile your next apps into the WASM runtime for more performant cold starts.

02:12:29
<transcript>: Apis my retail templates are just bolting my data source to my graphical API, so get requests.

02:12:37
<transcript>: My GraphQL API gets this request it needs you know it's doing a query and fetching data from.

02:12:40
<transcript>: These particular types.

02:12:46
<transcript>: Resolvers whatever like I need to get data for the persons or whatever it is.

02:12:46
<transcript>: i'm just

02:13:02
<transcript>: I'm just gluing the detail templates, just kind of gluing that request, taking the request, pulling the bits out of it. I need to make requests to my data store usually DynamoDB, but we played on stream with doing that with Planet Scale so you could actually write detail templates now that interacts with the plant scale service driver.

02:13:02
<transcript>: or

02:13:06
<transcript>: Or this just plants go http. Api.

02:13:14
<transcript>: So you can do that. You can do sequel queries with VTL and we've done that. I've got a repo for it. We can play with that again sometime.

02:13:18
<transcript>: Yeah. Anyway, if I understand correctly, VTL is prepared.

02:13:26
<transcript>: Is a prepared environment where your code is run against.

02:13:26
<transcript>: yeah

02:13:32
<transcript>: Yeah. It's it's like a it's just a template that's run in this Java runtime.

02:13:32
<transcript>: where

02:13:34
<transcript>: Where the request is being.

02:13:34
<transcript>: serviced

02:13:37
<transcript>: Serviced so like.

02:13:37
<transcript>: async

02:13:39
<transcript>: Async request comes in.

02:13:39
<transcript>: that

02:13:50
zachrip: so they have pre-provisioned VTL runtimes

02:13:50
<transcript>: That request is being handled by this Java app, and that Java app is just like executed your VTL template within that Java runtime that Java process if that makes sense.

02:13:53
<transcript>: Thank you for the follows.

02:13:53
<transcript>: dorain

02:13:57
zachrip: so it's sorta cheating?

02:14:03
<transcript>: Dorain, Zersog and Safel. I asked explicitly for you on the follow me a little bit ago, and nobody did. But then, like a few minutes later, three of you follow me. Thank you so much.

02:14:03
<transcript>: so

02:14:07
<transcript>: So I appreciate it. I appreciate all the follows.

02:14:07
<transcript>: i

02:14:19
<transcript>: I don't know. There's this funny thing with, like, making content. This kind of like cropped up into the conversation the last couple days. I don't know if you've all noticed this. I'm just gonna stop pretending I'm doing anything on my screen. I'm gonna come over here.

02:14:39
<transcript>: And if you guys know this, the conversation around, like, content and attention and clickbait all this. There's kind of a thing happening on Twitter, where we're talking about it and how the whole content thing kind of feels dirty. And I feel like when I'm streaming on Twitch, I'm entering.

02:14:39
<transcript>: into that

02:14:49
<transcript>: Into that realm. I'm a content creator. I hate that term. I hate that idea like no one grows up and says, I want to be a content creator when I get older.

02:14:54
<transcript>: I don't think you ever intentionally become whatever that is.

02:15:11
<transcript>: But it does feel bad to, like, want people's attention. And I don't. I honestly, I don't think I want your attention. I think I want your companionship. I want to hang out. I really enjoy hanging out while I work. Mostly. I don't work anymore. I just hang out.

02:15:11
<transcript>: i'm

02:15:13
<transcript>: I'm also just hang out here.

02:15:19
<transcript>: But I do enjoy. I will be working on some stuff. I'll tell you that little teaser.

02:15:24
<transcript>: There's gonna be more work happening on this stream and more of me streaming.

02:15:24
<transcript>: soon

02:15:26
<transcript>: Soon. But it's not Deborah.

02:15:30
<transcript>: It's not debt, bro. I'm not gonna be doing a Deborah plane.

02:15:30
dnbull: Until I found out your background is a green screen but also real .... not sure if you are even real Kappa

02:15:35
<transcript>: Let's see. I'm gonna catch up on chat.

02:15:35
<transcript>: there's a lot of

02:15:43
cowfacedude99: have I heard that before LUL

02:15:48
<transcript>: There's a lot of hidden complexity in GraphQL as well. You can use data loader for some of the time complexity, but there is also complexity, especially in nested relationships, when you're encouraged to create separate types. So dependent on parent metadata. Yeah, yeah, no, Yeah.

02:15:50
<transcript>: I get it.

02:15:53
<transcript>: I get all the downsides. There are ways.

02:15:53
<transcript>: like

02:16:09
<transcript>: Like in my stack with GraphQL building on App sync with DynamoDB, there's ways to kind of get around some of the data Loading problems. Like if you know how your API is going to be used. Like if you're writing a GraphQL API for like.

02:16:09
<transcript>: a general

02:16:26
<transcript>: A general audience like your customers are going to use your API directly. That's scary to me. I mostly only build graphical API's for myself, so I'm the only consumer of it. When you're the only consumer of it, it's pretty convenient. Like I can know here's how I'm gonna access data through the API.

02:16:26
<transcript>: it's less

02:16:31
<transcript>: It's less openended and I can optimize queries downstream in light of that.

02:16:44
<transcript>: So there's kind of a difference if you're building an API that's published publicly accessible. Yeah, that's scary. But I guess you can't do that with the RPC. Can you can you can you build like if you if your company is just selling an API.

02:16:44
<transcript>: can you do that

02:16:46
<transcript>: Can you do that with TRPC.

02:16:48
<transcript>: I don't think so.

02:16:48
<transcript>: i don't think that's

02:16:54
<transcript>: I don't think that's the point of TRPC think the point is that you own the front and the back.

02:16:54
<transcript>: right

02:16:55
<transcript>: Right.

02:17:02
zachrip: I think you could, just publish types

02:17:09
texoport: tRPC OpenAPI is a thing

02:17:15
<transcript>: I know is becoming really popular. I wonder if you can compile your next apps into the Wazer runtime for more performance. Cold starts. Great question. I also don't know. I don't know much about Watson. I know. Figma just got acquired and now there's a bunch of people talking about how they did a really cool thing like five years ago. And then we all.

02:17:15
<transcript>: just ignored it

02:17:16
<transcript>: Just ignored it.

02:17:21
<transcript>: So they have preprovision detail, runtimes that's sort of sheeting.

02:17:30
<transcript>: I think it's not even a VTL runtime. I think it's just like they already they're using Java, like AppSync is like a big Java app.

02:17:33
<transcript>: This is my understanding.

02:17:33
<transcript>: and so

02:17:44
<transcript>: And so the requests are being served within their Java app and within their Java app. Within that process, they're able to just bring in your VTL template and exit the request against that template.

02:17:44
<transcript>: like

02:17:47
<transcript>: Like transform the request basically.

02:17:47
<transcript>: i think

02:17:52
<transcript>: I think so. I don't think it's a separate thing that they preprovision. I could be wrong.

02:17:58
<transcript>: Until I found out your background is a green screen, but also real. Not sure if you were even real.

02:18:04
<transcript>: Have you heard what before? Cafes. I forgot what I said. Sorry.

02:18:04
<transcript>: you could

02:18:07
<transcript>: You could just publish types. Okay.

02:18:07
<transcript>: so you could

02:18:10
<transcript>: So you could do the TrpC.

02:18:13
<transcript>: O. T. Or PC, open API is a thing. Okay.

02:18:13
<transcript>: so people

02:18:16
fredkisss: You can do that, by converting your tRPC endpoints to openAPI specs (w/ the help of a lib). But at the end it is not really recommanded or the job to make that have not been done yet

02:18:18
<transcript>: So people have built APIs that they sell with the RPC.

02:18:26
<transcript>: Not really recommended the job to make the.

02:18:26
<transcript>: have not been

02:18:33
cowfacedude99: there is going to be a lot more work going forward on this stream

02:18:34
<transcript>: Have not been done yet. Yeah. I feel like the benefits of TrpC are like you're building a full stack app. You're building the frontend and the back end. You want fulltime safety.

02:18:34
<transcript>: if

02:18:45
<transcript>: If you're saying is like you're building a company where you're selling the API and you don't have a front end, I would guess you probably don't use TRPC. There's going to be a lot more work going forward on the stream. Oh, you've heard that before.

02:19:03
<transcript>: It looks like calface. It looks like you have the Versatile logo next to your name. Like your badge. Your Cheer one badge looks like the Versaille logo. For a second, I was like, oh, is he trying to tell me that he works at Bracell? And I should stop dogging on for sale. I'm not doging on her cell. I love herself. They use it every day.

02:19:07
<transcript>: But I have kind of said some things on this stream, I guess.

02:19:07
<transcript>: that are like

02:19:11
<transcript>: That are like, I don't know. They're not perfect.

02:19:19
<transcript>: Yeah. Cafe. There's gonna be an announcement soon. It's just taking some time. It takes some time to get things done, you know.

02:19:23
<transcript>: Paperwork, things like that. But there's got to be an announcement, and I'm gonna do some more.

02:19:24
cowfacedude99: I don't work at vercel LUL haven't even used it at all.

02:19:28
<transcript>: Things on this stream where I need to actually.

02:19:28
<transcript>: get

02:19:31
<transcript>: Get things done.

02:19:31
<transcript>: if that makes

02:19:34
<transcript>: If that makes sense, I would just be doing whatever I want to do.

02:19:34
<transcript>: but i

02:19:39
<transcript>: But I am excited about what I will be doing, so it's a winwin.

02:19:39
<transcript>: i think

02:19:42
<transcript>: I think the follow rappy.

02:19:42
<transcript>: and jess

02:19:43
<transcript>: And Jess.

02:19:43
<transcript>: and

02:19:49
<transcript>: And I saw the rain. But, Jeff, I don't think I saw that you followed me. Think you could follow.

02:19:54
zachrip: I hope you enjoy your new devrel job :)

02:19:54
<transcript>: We have gotten nothing tonned today. I think the only times on this stream we've gotten things done.

02:19:57
<transcript>: Are when we did my dot file.

02:19:57
<transcript>: when we

02:20:04
<transcript>: When we did my new of M. Config. It's not Devrel, Zach. It's not a devil job.

02:20:14
<transcript>: It's like not even it's hard for me to describe, like I would not take just a fulltime job under normal circumstances. This is not normal circumstances.

02:20:14
<transcript>: and it'll all

02:20:23
<transcript>: And it'll all make sense when I announce it sometime in the coming week ish weeks. Hopefully in the next week, we'll see.

02:20:29
<transcript>: Cafe doesn't even use Versaille.

02:20:30
zachrip: are you retired

02:20:33
<transcript>: That makes sense. I wouldn't have expected. You have.

02:20:35
<transcript>: Am I retired.

02:20:38
<transcript>: I don't know what I am.

02:20:40
<transcript>: I'm.

02:20:40
<transcript>: it's complicated

02:20:42
<transcript>: It's complicated.

02:20:46
<transcript>: I have like some runway and some savings.

02:20:46
<transcript>: i have

02:20:49
<transcript>: I have like a mediate.

02:20:49
<transcript>: my immediat

02:20:59
<transcript>: My immediate needs are met, is what I would say. So I kind of float around. It's not actually as great as it sounds. It's sometimes it's a little bit of like.

02:20:59
<transcript>: anxiety

02:21:07
<transcript>: Anxiety inducing like there's some angst involved in not knowing what you should do. Like when you don't have things you have to do.

02:21:10
zachrip: finding your purpose

02:21:17
<transcript>: It's kind of hard sometimes, and I know these are good problems to have, and I sound like, I don't know. I'm complaining about finding your purposes. Yeah, that's the hard thing. It's like when.

02:21:17
<transcript>: there's no

02:21:21
<transcript>: There's no like you have to work to make money to provide.

02:21:28
<transcript>: Like or you won't eat, or your kids won't eat. You don't have that. You have to kind of like, figure out what you want to do.

02:21:32
<transcript>: That makes you feel like you're spending your time.

02:21:32
<transcript>: it's worth it

02:21:36
<transcript>: It's worth it. You know what I mean? Like, you've kind of got to figure out.

02:21:36
<transcript>: what

02:21:42
<transcript>: What's worth spending time on it's a lot easier when you just have to work to make money.

02:21:54
<transcript>: And I have to work to make money like that. I'm not like, retired. I couldn't just never work again. But I don't, like, have to work this year if I don't want to that kind of thing, you know, like, I could go.

02:21:54
<transcript>: sometime

02:22:01
<transcript>: Sometime. Or just like, figuring stuff out. And that's what I've been doing this year. Mostly it's just trying to, like, figure out what I want to be, what I want to do.

02:22:10
<transcript>: And I think I settled on I want to teach. I just want to teach people stuff. So that's where I'm starting, like, a YouTube channel.

02:22:15
<transcript>: I'm gonna make some educational stuff content.

02:22:15
<transcript>: i don't know

02:22:26
<transcript>: I don't know. That's my current feeling. It just feels more fulfilling than consulting. Why am I talking about this? No one asked me this. I'm just like, I'm just going, just goin today.

02:22:34
<transcript>: I want to keep streaming. I just. I really enjoy streaming.

02:22:39
<transcript>: I want to show more.

02:22:45
<transcript>: I do need to get more done on the stream for everyone's sake.

02:22:45
<transcript>: like

02:22:53
<transcript>: Like it's probably not very entertaining. If I just talk, I just switch my category. Just chatting. Just chatting. Mostly what I'm doing.

02:22:58
<transcript>: I did apply for Twitch partnership.

02:23:03
texoport: Your streams are unintentional cozy streams

02:23:07
<transcript>: Because I hit their thresholds. Their path. The partner thing. I applied for that. We'll see if that happens.

02:23:07
<transcript>: they're unintention

02:23:12
<transcript>: They're unintentional. Cozy streams. Sounds nice. What's a cozy stream.

02:23:12
<transcript>: is it just

02:23:14
<transcript>: Is it just what it sounds like.

02:23:14
<transcript>: it's cozy

02:23:17
<transcript>: It's cozy except by the fire.

02:23:30
<transcript>: Yeah. I don't think you get Twitch, partner. The first time you apply, dude, you have to kind of like, keep applying. Keep trying.

02:23:30
<transcript>: this is

02:23:35
<transcript>: This is my first. I mean, I've been on the platform. How long have I been on? What was the command you can do, like.

02:23:35
<transcript>: account age

02:26:34
<transcript>: 's not too late

02:26:37
<transcript>: 's not too late. Let's do it. It's not too late.

02:26:37
laytanl_: I think prime has it

02:26:44
<transcript>: Let's see commands. Is there a watch? Time.

02:26:45
<transcript>: Watch, time.

02:26:49
<transcript>: I think there's a followup.

02:26:49
<transcript>: yeah

02:26:51
<transcript>: Yeah you can do follow a.

02:26:51
<transcript>: followed me

02:26:53
<transcript>: Followed me.

02:27:00
<transcript>: I'll see you watched up time. Is that what you mean.

02:27:02
<transcript>: Prime has it.

02:27:02
<transcript>: what

02:27:04
<transcript>: What would it be.

02:27:12
<transcript>: Watch time. Would that be like, how long you've been watching today? Or, oh, how long you've watched total? Like, how much you've been here and watching me.

02:27:17
laytanl_: No it says how long in total

02:27:18
<transcript>: I don't see anything. It must not be a fuss about thing.

02:27:23
laytanl_: like in hours of being on the stream

02:27:24
<transcript>: Yeah. Prime doesn't use Fafbar, right. He says he uses a stream elements.

02:27:25
tunvior: i don't think that infor is available

02:27:36
<transcript>: Yeah. Like an hours of being on the stream. That makes sense.

02:27:40
laytanl_: Prime uses Quirk

02:27:42
<transcript>: Calf AIDS, have you really only been on Twitch for two years.

02:27:43
stroopwafel26: I don't want to know my watch time tbh

02:27:45
<transcript>: That legit? Or is this a like another account.

02:27:54
<transcript>: Bryce, thank you for the follow. Brycella. Bryce Solela Willow Prime uses quirk. I've never even heard of quirk.

02:27:58
cowfacedude99: I think I am a relative noob. I got into twitch right along during the pandemic. mainly due to prime.

02:27:59
<transcript>: Yeah. Street. You've been here a while.

02:27:59
<transcript>: or is it supposed

02:28:02
<transcript>: Or is it supposed to be like watch time for every channel.

02:28:02
<transcript>: not just

02:28:04
<transcript>: Not just my channel.

02:28:09
<transcript>: Okay. You got in because of Prime.

02:28:11
laytanl_: Just your channel

02:28:17
<transcript>: All right. I want to actually, I do want to actually finish something.

02:28:20
<transcript>: Please let's finish something.

02:28:26
<transcript>: Start time. If there's no current round, we return so I can do that.

02:28:28
<transcript>: That.

02:28:28
<transcript>: start

02:28:32
<transcript>: Start current and expires the total would be expired.

02:28:36
<transcript>: Minus start right.

02:28:37
laytanl_: Quirk is made by @thealtf4stream

02:28:41
cowfacedude99: have you seen the altf4stream anytime? @adamdotdev quirk is developed on that stream

02:28:44
<transcript>: So that would be this number. It's total. But that's in what? That's in Milliseconds. Yeah.

02:28:46
<transcript>: Milliseconds.

02:28:55
daglee: If watch-time was for every channel. I think twitch is running in the background 8 hours / day for 10 years. That would be scary.

02:29:04
<transcript>: Quirk is made by the alt F four stream. Oh, I have heard of the all this forcetream. I'm following them. I think they stream like evening, my time and I'm never on my computer in the evenings. So there's some there's certain people that I just never get to catch their stream. Like I watch their VODs. Sometimes.

02:29:15
<transcript>: Yeah. No, I have. I've definitely seen some all that for Stream. They do a lot of ABS stuff. I'm a fan of AWS stuff. Thank you for the follow Gus.

02:29:25
<transcript>: Yeah. Watchtime is for your channel. That makes more sense. Blue Shirt TV thank you for the follow. Blue shirt.

02:29:25
<transcript>: if

02:29:31
<transcript>: If I see TV on your name I assume you probably Stream gonna follow you now.

02:29:31
<transcript>: in case

02:29:34
<transcript>: In case you stream and I can watch you.

02:29:34
<transcript>: like

02:29:37
<transcript>: Like two dorks TV streams.

02:29:42
<transcript>: Profits TV followed me.

02:29:42
<transcript>: are you a streamer as well

02:29:47
<transcript>: Are you a streamer as well? We're gonna follow you just in case you start streaming, and I want to watch it.

02:29:55
<transcript>: It's funny. I still discover people on Twitch that street and I didn't know like developers doing stuff I would like to watch.

02:29:55
<transcript>: discovery's not the best

02:29:57
<transcript>: Discovery's not the best, I guess.

02:29:57
<transcript>: it's not the best

02:29:59
<transcript>: It's not the best.

02:30:05
<transcript>: Okay.

02:30:08
<transcript>: Total in milliseconds.

02:30:15
<transcript>: And current is also milliseconds. If you do a new date. No, that's a date. It's a date.

02:30:19
<transcript>: So let's see. So if I want to know the percentage.

02:30:19
<transcript>: of

02:30:21
clbagrat: I'm streaming too :D typescript, react, and some fun shit like canvas :D

02:30:22
<transcript>: Of the thing that we're in. Let's go ahead and just make this.

02:30:25
<transcript>: At Ty.

02:30:29
clbagrat: clbagrLeft clbagrHeart clbagrRight

02:30:29
<transcript>: I guess that's when you just do Date Night now, right.

02:30:29
<transcript>: date

02:30:33
<transcript>: Date now. So this is now a number. So if I do.

02:30:33
<transcript>: total

02:30:38
<transcript>: Total current divided by total would be for our percentage right.

02:30:46
<transcript>: Laps equals current, divided by total. Now, do I need a Math floor? This.

02:30:49
<transcript>: Pizza.

02:30:52
<transcript>: Think so.

02:31:01
<transcript>: And then I need to Max it min. Max it. You know, I'm saying, like, if I do.

02:31:04
<transcript>: Math.

02:31:06
<transcript>: Max.

02:31:15
<transcript>: That and 100. Okay, now I'm making some assumptions. Is this gonna be between one and 100? No.

02:31:22
<transcript>: The current divided by total is gonna be between zero and one. So we need to multiply it by a hundred.

02:31:27
<transcript>: Or just cap this at one. I think we want it between zero and 100, right.

02:31:31
<transcript>: I do that.

02:31:34
<transcript>: Right, right.

02:31:34
<transcript>: do i

02:31:40
<transcript>: Do I want math to floor? I don't think I do. I want mass up floor to be out here.

02:31:43
<transcript>: This right? Did I do it.

02:31:45
<transcript>: Did I do it.

02:31:53
<transcript>: Did I do it? I don't know. That was kind of rushed.

02:31:57
<transcript>: Elapsed. Let's just let's just log it.

02:32:02
cowfacedude99: poll? @adamdotdev

02:32:03
<transcript>: Okay.

02:32:06
<transcript>: Let's do it.

02:32:20
<transcript>: I'm streaming to type, script, react and some fun shit like canvas. Cool CLB. I will follow you.

02:32:22
<transcript>: See.

02:32:22
<transcript>: your

02:32:24
<transcript>: Your Canvas stuff.

02:32:24
<transcript>: what

02:32:27
<transcript>: What's the Poll for cafes.

02:32:30
<transcript>: Said I should pull something.

02:32:30
<transcript>: like pol

02:32:32
<transcript>: Like poll. Do you stream.

02:32:32
<transcript>: is that the question

02:32:33
<transcript>: Is that the question.

02:32:41
<transcript>: What's happening.

02:32:41
<transcript>: that's a big number

02:32:42
<transcript>: That's a big number.

02:32:42
<transcript>: that's not

02:32:46
<transcript>: That's not what I want. Elapse, that's alright.

02:32:50
<transcript>: Oh, I meant Min, not Max.

02:32:56
<transcript>: For one thing so should go up to a hundred. So if I click on one.

02:33:01
<transcript>: And then it starts over. It should be like zero to 100. Is it doing it? No.

02:33:01
<transcript>: they just stuck

02:33:04
<transcript>: They just stuck to a hundred. Okay.

02:33:12
<transcript>: What was I gonna pull? Cafe. You want me to pull something.

02:33:25
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:33:25
<transcript>: current div

02:33:27
cowfacedude99: First try polls.

02:33:32
<transcript>: Current divided by total total. Let's just log all this console. That log total.

02:33:34
<transcript>: Console.

02:33:36
<transcript>: Log.

02:33:38
<transcript>: logs

02:33:39
<transcript>: Logs.

02:33:47
<transcript>: Okay. So that's the number for total. It's 10 seconds. Yeah. So 100 milliseconds. Cool.

02:33:50
<transcript>: Cool.

02:33:54
<transcript>: That's what I expected. But then if current, what's current.

02:34:01
<transcript>: Is a big number. I would not divide current by total. That would be wrong.

02:34:06
<transcript>: Alright because total is just.

02:34:06
<transcript>: the duration

02:34:10
<transcript>: The duration between the two current is like.

02:34:10
<transcript>: a big number

02:34:15
<transcript>: A big number. It's the current millisecond since 1970. Whatever.

02:34:15
<transcript>: first

02:34:18
<transcript>: First try. Poles.

02:34:24
<transcript>: First tripoles? I don't understand. Calf. What? What do you mean.

02:34:26
<transcript>: First try. Poles.

02:34:33
<transcript>: I don't understand.

02:34:45
<transcript>: Current. So what I really want is Why would I do current divideol? It's so dumb. I want to do current minus start.

02:34:47
<transcript>: Right.

02:34:47
<transcript>: current minus

02:34:50
<transcript>: Current minus start Yeah.

02:34:50
<transcript>: yeah

02:34:52
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:34:55
<transcript>: Current minus start right.

02:34:56
cowfacedude99: polls on whether you get things working on first try or not.

02:34:57
<transcript>: How about that.

02:35:01
<transcript>: Left hand, side.

02:35:06
<transcript>: Start is not a time.

02:35:06
<transcript>: okay

02:35:08
<transcript>: Okay, let's just do this.

02:35:08
<transcript>: get

02:35:10
<transcript>: Get time.

02:35:29
<transcript>: Okay. Now what do we have now.

02:35:29
<transcript>: total

02:35:30
<transcript>: Total.

02:35:32
<transcript>: Current.

02:35:35
<transcript>: Elapse.

02:35:44
<transcript>: Should be. I guess it could be like actually a hundred. Now let's see what happens. Like what happens. I click that.

02:35:48
<transcript>: It's not. It's always a hundred.

02:35:48
<transcript>: currently

02:35:49
<transcript>: Currently.

02:35:53
<transcript>: Log.

02:35:57
<transcript>: Current minus start.

02:35:57
<transcript>: hold on when

02:36:01
<transcript>: Hold on when you get things working on first try or not.

02:36:03
<transcript>: Oh, I see.

02:36:03
<transcript>: like

02:36:15
<transcript>: Like Poll. Will I get this? Oh, I clearly didn't get it on the first track. Did I say I might get on the first try? That was silly. We all know I wasn't gonna be on the first try. Oh, look at that. So that's right. So that current minus start.

02:36:17
<transcript>: Parentheses.

02:36:17
<transcript>: it's like i

02:36:21
<transcript>: It's like I'm doing it all over again. I'm learning all the same mistakes.

02:36:26
<transcript>: We did all these same things before. Had all these issues.

02:36:26
<transcript>: here we

02:36:28
<transcript>: Here we are.

02:36:28
<transcript>: once again

02:36:29
<transcript>: Once again.

02:36:34
<transcript>: Elemental data double.

02:36:34
<transcript>: timer

02:36:37
<transcript>: Timers working. We did it.

02:36:39
<transcript>: We did it.

02:36:42
stroopwafel26: Oh hey @2DorksTV just released a podcast

02:36:44
<transcript>: I don't love the the choppiness. I can do it more often.

02:36:44
<transcript>: like

02:36:47
<transcript>: Like we could do like every ten milliseconds.

02:36:52
<transcript>: Okay, move on.

02:36:52
<transcript>: i still

02:36:55
<transcript>: I still have really like Jittery, you know.

02:37:03
<transcript>: Oh, cuz. It's only it's only doing every one. I don't need to do math. Floor. That's just unnecessarily restrictive.

02:37:07
<transcript>: Unnecessary.

02:37:11
<transcript>: Can I do two minutes.

02:37:16
<transcript>: Shut up.

02:37:16
<transcript>: i think

02:37:18
<transcript>: I think this one's FSX.

02:37:23
<transcript>: Now it should be more fluid. Look at that. How fluid it is.

02:37:30
<transcript>: I probably don't even have to every ten milliseconds. I probably do like maybe just a hundred again.

02:37:33
<transcript>: See.

02:37:33
<transcript>: this thing

02:37:35
<transcript>: This thing.

02:37:38
<transcript>: Cli.

02:37:42
<transcript>: Okay, it looks better with the ten.

02:37:42
<transcript>: this feel

02:37:45
<transcript>: This feels worse than animating but you know.

02:37:45
<transcript>: and have it

02:37:47
<transcript>: And have it all.

02:37:47
<transcript>: can have it all

02:37:50
<transcript>: Can have it all in life got a.

02:37:54
<transcript>: Gotta make some sacrifices.

02:37:54
<transcript>: pull somebody

02:38:02
<transcript>: Pull somebody get things working for sure. Oh, hey, Tuudorxi just released a pocket podcast. Oh, nice. Tudorcs was just here. And then they just published a podcast.

02:38:02
<transcript>: maybe

02:38:07
<transcript>: Maybe someone did it for them, or maybe they just popped off because they needed to publish it.

02:38:09
<transcript>: Everybody check out two Dorks podcasts.

stroopwafel26: Look up "those were the days"

02:38:33
<transcript>: Okay, so we got the timer working. I feel pretty good about it. We need to actually incorporate it into the back end, and, like, not let you get a score. Let's just do the score thing. I gotta take a quick break.

02:38:38
<transcript>: Quick break. And then when I come back.

02:38:38
<transcript>: we're gonna work on

02:38:41
<transcript>: We're gonna work on the score. I remember doing this, like.

02:38:49
<transcript>: Two weeks ago, we're gonna work on the score now, and I think we started to and then we work on something else that in here we are. I'll be back.

02:50:13
snowglobe25: Ahh it's a reference from the OZarks

02:50:17
<transcript>: From the Netflix show. I don't know what that is. I don't watch Netflix much.

02:50:17
<transcript>: so reference

02:50:23
<transcript>: So reference from the Ozarks. Oh, I gotcha, I'm so sorry. I don't actually watch the show.

02:50:27
<transcript>: I live in the Ozarks. I watched the first few episodes.

02:50:27
<transcript>: and

02:50:30
<transcript>: And seemed pretty accurate.

02:50:30
<transcript>: i mean

02:50:32
<transcript>: I mean way overdraumatized.

02:50:32
<transcript>: not

02:50:36
<transcript>: Not accurate in that sense. But every TV show is.

02:50:41
<transcript>: Doesn't look like the Ozarks. They had to kind of hilly stuffed on.

02:50:47
<transcript>: Some of the people definitely seemed like Ozarkians, but yeah, I don't watch it.

02:50:49
<transcript>: So I know nothing about it.

02:50:53
fanieldanara: Filmed in Georgia LUL

02:50:58
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat, though. Zando. So a little meta comment on like developer content. I just don't think Yeah.

02:50:58
<transcript>: so i knew

02:51:04
<transcript>: So I knew it wasn't filmed in the Ozark Spaniel. They did make it look like it looks like the ones like that.

02:51:13
<transcript>: Developer content. I just I don't think there's any way to do funny Dev jokes. I just I get I see a lot of these.

02:51:13
<transcript>: every time

02:51:14
<transcript>: Every time.

<transcript>: A day and a developer's life.

02:51:43
<transcript>: Okay. So Cassie. Yeah, Cassie do.

<transcript>: like

02:51:56
schrew: Forrest Brazeal does funny dev songs, new one just dropped

02:51:57
<transcript>: Like, I don't know what it is if it's just that developers, we don't have very good senses of humor. But basically every time I see the vice.

02:51:57
<transcript>: try to make

02:51:59
<transcript>: Try to make like Dev jokes.

02:52:04
<transcript>: It's just not funny. It's really not. I wish we'd all just stopped trying.

stroopwafel26: I love all her jokes, she basically does dad jokes :')

02:52:12
<transcript>: Forests. Also funny. Oh, he just dropped a new song. Yeah, he's very talented and funny. Okay, so there are funny developers. There are.

02:52:17
<transcript>: There's just so many people though trying to be funny.

02:52:17
<transcript>: and

02:52:23
<transcript>: And I just don't think they're funny. Maybe somebody does think those jokes are funny. Like.

02:52:23
<transcript>: i don't want

02:52:27
dnbull: I agree a lot of it is not funny

02:52:30
<transcript>: I don't want to name specific things that I've seen, because then it's like I'm calling out specific people, and it's not. It's no big fault. We've all tried.

02:52:34
<transcript>: Darren, thank you so much for the gift. Subs.

02:52:34

sargath666: @adamdotdev do you have some insight if advantage 360 will be available to buy also with shipping to EU?

02:52:44
dnbull: you being a developer is already funny enough Kappa

02:52:48
<transcript>: Yeah. Cassidy Forest. They're funny. That's a good call. But there's so many.

02:52:48
<transcript>: people

02:52:56
<transcript>: People trying to do the just like things we run into it's relatable stuff. It's like anytime trying to people try to be relatable.

02:52:56
<transcript>: with

02:53:01
<transcript>: With like, relatable Dev things, but do them in a funny way. I just never find that funny.

02:53:05
<transcript>: Never do you being a developer is already funny enough.

02:53:12
daryn_dev: <3

02:53:22
<transcript>: Sargathy has some insight if Advanced 360 will be available to buy also shipping the EU. I think I saw them say they were gonna try and ship it outside the US. I think I saw that somewhere at some point I'm sure it will. I think even somebody said this fall.

02:53:22
<transcript>: i don't remember where

02:53:29
<transcript>: I don't remember where I read that. Darren, thank you so much. I really appreciate the gifts. That's very kind of you.

02:53:48
stroopwafel26: My code makes people laugh, that's good right?

02:53:48
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm trying. I really wish I could think of, like, an example that doesn't call someone out. Like if I just saw content and I didn't think it was funny and it just boughters me. I don't want to say it because then, like, you can tie it back to the person that did the content. Somebody will figure it out. And I'll feel bad. I'm not trying to shame that person.

02:53:52
<transcript>: What's an example? Like.

02:54:12
daryn_dev: Finally found a dev I enjoy watching SeemsGood

02:54:12
<transcript>: They'll just take examples I've seen from like Prime Stream when he was like looking at TikTok, which I don't really look at TikTok, but the bits I've been exposed to the developer TikTok are just a treasure trove of bad jokes. Like the like Senior Devs. We've seen it all. We're hardened. Eugene or Dads, you freak.

02:54:12
<transcript>: out about everything

02:54:15
<transcript>: Out about everything but we've seen it all you're not gonna.

02:54:15
<transcript>: like that kind of

02:54:23
<transcript>: Like that kind of stuff. Any jokes about that? Like the desk on fire. Don't care. Like that kind of stuff. Just not funny. Just stop.

02:54:23
<transcript>: with those

02:54:25
<transcript>: With those. They're just not funny.

02:54:25
<transcript>: my code

02:54:29
<transcript>: My code makes people laugh. That's good, right? Yeah. I think so.

02:54:32
<transcript>: They're in you and enjoy watching me.

02:54:32
<transcript>: what is it

02:54:37
<transcript>: What is it? Is it the talking about how things I see on the Internet aren't funny.

02:54:40
<transcript>: Or did you watch something before that? Because I feel like.

02:54:40
<transcript>: right now

02:54:41
daryn_dev: Hahahha

02:54:45
<transcript>: Right now I'm just. I'm just subtwitching.

02:54:45
<transcript>: it's like a

02:54:50
<transcript>: It's like a subtweet, but it's a sub Twitch of stuff I've seen, but I don't think it's funny.

02:55:02
<transcript>: Okay, let's try to get a little something done here. Then we'll be done here pretty shortly. My streams have been shorter because I've been waking up so late. I got into a late habit. I'm just gonna staying up my wife and I just.

<transcript>: Okay, so we got the timer working.

02:55:08
<transcript>: now we just

02:55:11
<transcript>: Now we just need to say like you can't answer.

02:55:11

cowfacedude99: before you go any further.....

02:55:27
<transcript>: Somebody got me. You got me cow face. You got me right as I was doing something, I was gonna get so much done cafes. You don't even know I was gonna get so much stuff done. And then you just recrolled me. That's the reason I got nothing done today.

02:55:27
<transcript>: it was laten

02:55:31
<transcript>: It was latent. Cafes his fault. Before you go any further.

02:55:33
snowglobe25: lol

<transcript>: The right kind of energy.

02:55:36
<transcript>: well it's

02:55:41
<transcript>: Well, it's because I don't try to make silly Dev jokes. It's just the Dev jokes. They're just no good.

02:55:41
<transcript>: they're just not

02:55:43
<transcript>: They're just not very good.

02:55:47
<transcript>: Trying to think of another example without throwing someone at the bus.

02:55:47
<transcript>: it's

02:55:50
stroopwafel26: the dad jokes though...

02:55:51
<transcript>: It's like anytime people do like.

02:55:51
<transcript>: a fake

02:55:52
stroopwafel26: more dad jokes plz

02:56:03
<transcript>: A fake them waking up to start their day and like, what they're what, like, Dev life is all about. I think it's when people are trying to, like, reach out to people who aren't devs. And like, explain what it's like to be a Dev. I think that kind of stuff just really.

02:56:03
<transcript>: grind

02:56:03

<transcript>: you know

02:56:06
nerijusdu: dev jokes are not that good, but dev memes are hella funny

02:56:13
<transcript>: You know, just. I just don't think I actively don't think it's funny. I can't just ignore it. It's like it's so not funny.

02:56:13
<transcript>: that

02:56:16
<transcript>: That I have to say something. You know what I mean.

02:56:16

02:56:40
ayebeedeee: ty

02:56:44
<transcript>: Saw that context and taste and appropriate time. Yeah. Maybe some people think it's funny. I guess that's why there's so much of it, so much content around.

02:56:44
<transcript>: things

02:56:48
<transcript>: Things like relatable Dev stuff. I just don't find funny.

02:56:53
sargath666: I think that the worst thing in dev world is the senior dev > junior dev attitude

02:56:57
<transcript>: Try and tiny things. When you just start working, you did a great job. I'm kind of disappointed. Nobody has. Nobody's redeemed.

02:57:03
<transcript>: Oneonone call with me. I'm really excited to have a oneonone call with somebody who's been here long enough.

02:57:03
<transcript>: to

02:57:04
<transcript>: To.

02:57:04
<transcript>: afford

02:57:06
<transcript>: Afford the number of points.

02:57:06
<transcript>: so i'm making

02:57:08
<transcript>: So I'm making.

02:57:08
<transcript>: it

privann: What vscode theme is that

02:57:10
fragaverage: No one close enough to 100k I bet

02:57:16
<transcript>: It. And then I didn't see it. I feel really bad, because there's technically nothing that happens when you redeem it. I have to, like, see it, and then schedule a call with you.

02:57:16
<transcript>: no one close enough to

02:57:24
<transcript>: No one close enough to 100K. Is it a hundred K? Did I do one hundred K? I was really scared about, like, people just peppering my calendar with oneonone calls.

02:57:28
cowfacedude99: I tend to rick roll you all the time LUL

02:57:35
<transcript>: What vs. Code theme? It's actually Neovim, and it's but it's Dracula. So if you just use vs. Code and use Dracula, it'll look a lot like this. Probably the font is operator mono.

02:57:38
th3_l3m0n: im at 12k, so a little bit off

02:57:40
<transcript>: Yeah, calf. A busy spinning is points. Rick rolling me.

02:57:50
<transcript>: You'll get there, just keep hanging out.

02:57:50
<transcript>: the worst

02:57:56
snowglobe25: neovim dotfiles?

02:57:57
<transcript>: The worst thing in Dev world is the senior Dev to junior Dev attitude. You mean jokes about it, sargass, or the actual.

02:58:00
<transcript>: Senior Dev greater than Junior Dev.

02:58:04
<transcript>: What is even a senior Dev like, I think it's funny.

02:58:08
<transcript>: I think it's funny when people act like titles matter.

02:58:08
<transcript>: like

02:58:16
<transcript>: Like they're a seat and then don't get me wrong. It's an accomplishment to get promoted and like to be recognized by your peers that.

02:58:19
<transcript>: You did a great job.

02:58:19
<transcript>: you're

02:58:28
fanieldanara: You could do a random drop, where it gets enabled in a stream like once a month and the first person to redeem it gets a call. That way you can do one a month and not be worried about flooding your calendar

02:58:29
<transcript>: You're now you're taking on more responsibility. I don't want to belittle that I can't talk. I don't work places. And we don't work places you don't generally like.

02:58:29
<transcript>: see a lot of

02:58:43
daryn_dev: You'd need to watch 277 hours to get enough points, on a tier 3 sub WutFace

02:58:47
<transcript>: See a lot of value and stuff, like titles and promotions and all that. But I think it's funny when it's like, oh, I'm a senior Dev. Like, it's so arbitrary. Your organization may be labeled you that, but like, definitely shouldn't be walking around like, you have some superiority complex over other people.

02:58:47
<transcript>: because

02:58:53
<transcript>: Because one company senior Dev is another person's. L two or whatever.

02:58:53
<transcript>: out of

02:58:54
<transcript>: Out of L, ten.

02:59:09
<transcript>: There are other is.

02:59:14
daryn_dev: @daryn_dev xD

02:59:18
<transcript>: Does JS. Devs develop in Neovem? They do lately. I think we're all switching over to Neil them. There is a there's a conference. We all just.

02:59:38
<transcript>: Time we switch to Neoven, I just switched to Twitch. Honestly, I got on Twitch, and it's like everybody uses new of them. Soon I'll start writing Russ because everyone writes Russ with Neoven. That's just a Twitch thing, right? Do a random drop where it gets enabled in a stream like once a month and the first person to redeem it gets a call. That's a great idea. Faniel.

02:59:41
<transcript>: I love that idea.

02:59:46
<transcript>: That way you can do one a month and not be worried about flooding your calendar.

02:59:46
<transcript>: that's so

02:59:55
<transcript>: That's so brilliant. I like the idea of like it being someone that's around, you know, they're around quite a bit. And I thought if they had that many points, there's somebody I know.

02:59:55
<transcript>: like

02:59:59
<transcript>: Like we've hung out here for a while, but I think 100K was too high.

03:00:00
fragaverage: Like

03:00:01
fragaverage: ME

03:00:03
<transcript>: 277 hours. Okay.

03:00:03
<transcript>: on a tier

03:00:06
<transcript>: On a Tier three sub. It's too high.

03:00:06
<transcript>: so i have

03:00:07
fragaverage: Nah 100k is good, you have to EARN it

03:00:12
<transcript>: So I have officially made that way too high. We'll drop that down, and then maybe we'll move over to.

03:00:12
<transcript>: we'll move

03:00:17
<transcript>: We'll move over to the thing that was just suggested.

03:00:28
<transcript>: Try and find it. Where was that? Oh, yeah, Faniel. Random drop. I love that. Just like, enable it. We could announce it.

03:00:30
<transcript>: So.

03:00:30
<transcript>: you have to earn

03:00:34
<transcript>: You have to earn it. Frag things you have to earn it. How many points do you have? Frag.

03:00:34
<transcript>: you've

03:00:39
fragaverage: that is classified

03:00:39
<transcript>: You've been hanging out. I don't think. I don't think I've streamed 277 hours yet.

03:00:44
<transcript>: So I don't think anyone could possibly have 100K is classified.

03:00:49
stroopwafel26: I'm at 23k MaxLOL

03:00:49
<transcript>: That's funny. Okay. New game. Here we go. Here we go. What is this one.

03:00:49
<transcript>: local z

03:00:51
<transcript>: Local zones.

03:00:57
fragaverage: im on 70k, but I spent a good amount rick rolling you etc in the early days

03:00:59
<transcript>: Got it. Nailed it. Okay. So the timer has to stop. These are the things we did we got we got into this before.

03:00:59
<transcript>: you got to

03:01:01
<transcript>: You got to stop the timer when you answer.

03:01:06
<transcript>: At the CLI. Oh, no, it's not code pipeline. Oh.

03:01:08
<transcript>: Inspector.

03:01:13
delvoid: gifts and bits give points right?

03:01:15
<transcript>: 70k Stroop. Is at 23K.

03:01:15
sargath666: @adamdotdev like making laughter or being rude ... and lack of soft skills for some individuals to certain extent, and conviction that when I'm senior dev I'm biggest the best, and better from the rest, that I don't have to exchange remarks with jr fo instance

03:01:21
<transcript>: Spent a good Mount rule Rick rolling, etc. So you maybe could have gotten 100K by now frag.

03:01:24
<transcript>: Gifts and bits, give points. Oh, do they.

03:01:32
schrew: 43k checking in

03:01:34
<transcript>: Sargoth like making laughter, being rude and lack of sauscules for some individuals to certain extent and conviction that when I'm senior Dev, I'm biggest.

03:01:34
<transcript>: better than

03:01:39
<transcript>: Better than the rest. That I don't have to exchange remarks with Junior, for instance. Yeah.

03:01:39
<transcript>: there definitely should be

03:01:43
<transcript>: There definitely should be true with 43K Whoo.

03:01:43
<transcript>: definitely

03:01:51
fragaverage: I dont mind either price to be honest, I won't be redeeming until I can get the value from it

03:01:52
<transcript>: Definitely not a fan of people thinking they're better than people just in general. But I think the Senior Dev thing is such an arbitrary.

03:01:52
<transcript>: like

03:01:53
<transcript>: Like.

03:01:53
<transcript>: what

03:02:00
<transcript>: What is a senior Dev? There are people who've been in programming for two years, like Next, who's way better.

03:02:00
<transcript>: next

03:02:08
<transcript>: Next. Barely started. He's already better than me. Like how long you've been doing? It is not the answer. That's not what makes you senior.

03:02:08
<transcript>: a title

03:02:21
<transcript>: A title at some random company. Does that make you senior? I don't know. I feel like I just don't believe in the idea of seeing your devs and then all the jokes and the tropes that go with Senior Des versus Junior Dev, all of its garbage.

03:02:21
<transcript>: just garbage

03:02:24
<transcript>: Just garbage. Get rid of it. I can do without all of it.

03:02:31
<transcript>: You won't be redeeming until you get value.

03:02:33
<transcript>: Ouch frag? Ouch.

03:02:37
<transcript>: No value. You're gonna get a oneonone call with me.

03:02:43
<transcript>: No, I don't know what? I don't know what? I'll talk with someone. I guess Frag will be the first person that could afford it.

03:02:43
<transcript>: what will we talk about

03:02:46
<transcript>: What will we talk about? Frag. Can't wait.

03:02:49
<transcript>: It'll be so fun. I think we should drop it a little lower, though.

03:02:49
<transcript>: i don't know

03:02:52
<transcript>: I don't know I think 100 case too high.

03:02:52
<transcript>: fifty

03:02:55
<transcript>: 50k sounds right like if 50K.

03:03:00
<transcript>: If that meant Stroop and true and frag could be redeeming pretty soon.

03:03:02
<transcript>: We're already redeeming.

03:03:02
<transcript>: i feel like that

03:03:04
<transcript>: I feel like that's the right cadence.

03:03:18
<transcript>: Maybe you guys will Rick roll me last. At least maybe people will start trying to reach. I'm just gonna do it right now. 50k. Where is it? I'd have to open up my dot. I don't want to open it up right now.

03:03:18
<transcript>: but i'll

03:03:23
<transcript>: But I'll change that. Sometimes it's all sort in that repo. Somebody submit a pull request.

03:03:23
<transcript>: and that's the cool thing

03:03:26
<transcript>: And that's the cool thing about my overlays.

03:03:27
<transcript>: Is.

03:03:28
stroopwafel26: No idea what we would be talking about

03:03:30
fragaverage: That's totally not what I meant. If the contents was geared towards getting advice from yourself, then I'm not in a position with a project yet where I need some advice. If that makes sense LUL

snowglobe25: 10 denied rickrolls is good price

03:03:37
stroopwafel26: maybe rants

03:03:40
<transcript>: There any active Pull request. Now you'll see when I do transitions, there's animations. Those are because people submitted Pull requests to add new animations to my transition, and then they get announced.

03:03:43
<transcript>: So if you went in here.

03:03:45
cowfacedude99: @FragAverage me too.

03:03:47
<transcript>: In here and you went to rewards.

03:03:47
<transcript>: you could just

03:03:51
<transcript>: You could just submit a pull request to drop.

03:03:57
<transcript>: This one oneonone call with that could be 50K. You know we could drop that.

03:03:59
<transcript>: We'll do that sometime.

03:04:02
<transcript>: Okay.

03:04:12
<transcript>: Stroop. No idea what we'd be talking about. Well, we figured out it's totally not.

03:04:12
<transcript>: contents was

03:04:19
<transcript>: Contents was geared towards getting advice from yourself. I'm not in a position with the project. That where I need some advice that makes total sense.

03:04:19
<transcript>: it could be whatever

03:04:26
<transcript>: It could be whatever. It doesn't have to be advice. I don't know if I have good advice. I'd give you advice right here. Anyway. You just asked. I'll give you advice.

03:04:26
<transcript>: the one

03:04:39
<transcript>: The oneonone is a time where we can do other things. We could we could talk about stuff we don't want to talk about on stream. And I get to actually hear your voice. I think the Oneonone calls are more for me than they are for you.

03:04:39
<transcript>: because i

03:04:41
<transcript>: Because I get to actually hear you talk.

03:04:45
<transcript>: Ten denied Rick Rolls is a good price.

03:04:49
<transcript>: Okay.

<transcript>: Let's go to the server. We haven't messed with the server today.

03:04:55
<transcript>: Name router.

03:04:55
<transcript>: oh let's

03:04:55
stroopwafel26: You can hear my Dutch English

03:04:56
<transcript>: Oh, let's run here.

03:05:00
<transcript>: Oh, how did we get out here? What happened.

03:05:01

<transcript>: What's going on here.

03:05:11
<transcript>: What's going on here? We want game that router. Interesting. What is.

03:05:16
<transcript>: It.

03:05:23
delvoid: @FragAverage oh nono that is mean

03:05:23
<transcript>: Sweet pages. Interesting. I don't want that to be the thanks for the followup. Carter.

03:05:28
<transcript>: No frack.

03:05:28
<transcript>: no

03:05:29
<transcript>: No.

03:05:29
<transcript>: that's a terrible

03:05:31
<transcript>: That's a terrible idea.

03:05:33
<transcript>: That is so mean.

03:05:39
<transcript>: So mean I did see, where is it? Wrath of the Litch King is what they've got going on classic right now.

03:05:39
<transcript>: that takes me back

03:05:42
stroopwafel26: @FragAverage Someone tell his wife to take away his computer

03:05:46
<transcript>: That takes me back. That's what I was doing. Like wow, I think was wrath of the Lich King would just be lit King.

03:05:46
<transcript>: on

03:05:49
<transcript>: On Heroic Mode or whatever it was called back then.

03:05:49
fragaverage: yesss, I'm trying to leave it be!

03:05:52
<transcript>: Okay, stop, stop, stop. It.

03:05:54
fragaverage: Its calling me

03:05:55
<transcript>: I have such an addictive personality.

03:05:57
fragaverage: and you

03:05:58
<transcript>: Someone tells wife's takeaways computer exactly.

03:06:02
<transcript>: Don't not.

03:06:02
<transcript>: calling us

03:06:08
<transcript>: Calling us. It's not calling us frag. We got stuff to do. We got stuff to do, like, AW, gifts.

03:06:11
<transcript>: Elapsed.

03:06:17
<transcript>: Was I doing? Oh, yeah, yeah. I was trying to figure out why I did this. Let's just close new of them.

03:06:17
<transcript>: i'm

03:06:20
<transcript>: I'm in the AWS. Great Directory, right.

03:06:20
<transcript>: yeah

03:06:25
<transcript>: Yeah. In them. I don't know what happened there. Why did it? Why did it do that.

03:06:25
<transcript>: so the game

03:06:28
<transcript>: So the game router. Here we go.

03:06:30
<transcript>: And.

03:06:36
<transcript>: Let's do. Oh, that drops the music again. I keep doing that.

03:06:39
<transcript>: So this is create range.

03:06:44
<transcript>: Answer.

03:06:44
<transcript>: okay

03:06:45
stroopwafel26: I'm cheap so that's what's stopping me from playing WoW at a monthly fee

03:06:48
<transcript>: Okay. Progress. So this is where I was trying to figure out.

03:06:54
<transcript>: On the back end. We need to make sure if you've gone past the expiration. You don't get points right.

03:06:59
<transcript>: Oh, we're already doing a score. You're getting a score. We're just not showing it.

03:06:59
<transcript>: so if you get

03:07:05
<transcript>: So if you get it cracked, we get one point. If you don't get it cracked, you get zero points.

03:07:12
<transcript>: So we're incrementing the score just like that. Thanks for the following is Matt.

03:07:14
<transcript>: Thank you so much.

03:07:19
<transcript>: Stroop is cheap. I'm also cheap. That's why I don't play video games because I'm cheap.

03:07:29
schrew: f2p life over here

03:07:30
<transcript>: Correct. Okay. So progress that I do all this. Right. Start.

03:07:33
<transcript>: Round Start Get time.

03:07:36
<transcript>: Total.

03:07:36
<transcript>: we just did

03:07:37
<transcript>: We just did this, right.

03:07:39
stroopwafel26: did you look at your setup there? you're NOT cheap MaxLOL

03:07:43
<transcript>: We just did this. We can literally come over here and copy it. Probably.

03:07:49
<transcript>: All that.

03:07:50
<transcript>: Go back here.

03:07:59
<transcript>: Paste it. Let's look at what we got here.

03:08:01
<transcript>: The start.

03:08:04
<transcript>: Would be.

03:08:07
<transcript>: What's current round round.

03:08:07
<transcript>: round

03:08:19
<transcript>: Roundup start to get time current would be date now expires would be round that expires a good time total and then elapse so I can delete all this.

03:08:45
<transcript>: And then progress. Elapsed total. Now elapse is my percentage. Right.

03:08:45
<transcript>: it's

03:08:48
<transcript>: It's a number between zero and 100.

03:08:48
<transcript>: so i don't need

03:08:50
<transcript>: So I don't need progress.

03:08:52
<transcript>: Down here.

03:08:59
<transcript>: What was I doing with Progress? I was gonna say, if it's greater than what.

03:09:02
<transcript>: The answer is incorrect.

03:09:07
<transcript>: Expired. Okay.

03:09:07
<transcript>: so

03:09:10
<transcript>: So did I just delete expired.

03:09:17
<transcript>: Was expired. I guess here would be.

03:09:24
<transcript>: Expired equals Elapse greater than 100. Right.

03:09:32
<transcript>: You can get it correct. But you but it was expired so you didn't get points for it, right.

03:09:34
<transcript>: So correct.

03:09:34
<transcript>: and

03:09:38
<transcript>: And not expired. You get one point.

03:09:38
<transcript>: else you get

03:09:44
<transcript>: Else you get 00:00 a.m.. I really returning the score. I'm returning the whole game. Okay.

03:09:48
cowfacedude99: why Math.min if you are doing elapsed>100?

03:09:50
<transcript>: So that'll have the score on it. Okay. We just saved this. I think I have to restart the server. Unfortunately.

03:09:57
<transcript>: Oh, I don't have anything running anyway, okay, the MPM run does.

03:10:06
<transcript>: Oh, wait, no, I wasn't running it in here.

03:10:09
<transcript>: I was running it in here.

03:10:18
<transcript>: Okay.

03:10:20
<transcript>: Let's start this over.

03:10:25
<transcript>: Why math? Min. If you're doing Alaska.

03:10:25
<transcript>: great

03:10:27
<transcript>: Great question.

03:10:29
<transcript>: It's a great question.

03:10:33
<transcript>: That's a great, great question. Let's see. I'm done that's. Why.

03:10:33
<transcript>: that's

03:10:36
<transcript>: That's your answer right there.

03:10:41
<transcript>: Math man so it's only gonna be up to 100 expired would be.

03:10:45
<transcript>: Greater than equal. And then I can just not do math. Dot man.

03:11:01
<transcript>: Okay.

03:11:01
<transcript>: run it again

03:11:02
<transcript>: Run it again.

03:11:02
<transcript>: i don't know if

03:11:10
<transcript>: I don't know if I need to actually do that. I don't remember if I had to restart the server. I feel like when I was making therapy changes, I did need to research the server. I think so.

03:11:13
<transcript>: Okay, let's see.

03:11:18
<transcript>: Let's see things of the ball snow globe.

03:11:22
<transcript>: Oh yeah? New game.

03:11:26
<transcript>: Let's let's do this.

03:11:28
<transcript>: Oh, I gotta be fast.

03:11:33
<transcript>: What is it? Service catalog. Maybe. Yeah.

03:11:37
<transcript>: Okay. I need to stop logging.

03:11:41
<transcript>: For the front end.

03:11:44
<transcript>: This front end. Yeah. Stop logging. Elapse.

03:12:00
<transcript>: What was this one? It should tell us. We didn't get we didn't get this one right because we're too late. But let's try and actually get it right. Distress or open the lemonary deep learning error. Okay, so Where's the response.

03:12:09
<transcript>: Oh, is it rendering that I was thrining that often because we're yeah, yeah, I don't love that.

03:12:13
<transcript>: So here's our current round.

03:12:13
<transcript>: i

03:12:17
<transcript>: I want to see the answer. Okay, I gotta stop logging the current round.

03:12:20
<transcript>: Console, back.

03:12:20
<transcript>: yeah

03:12:21
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:12:30
<transcript>: Start over here.

03:12:33
<transcript>: New game.

03:12:36
<transcript>: Distributed Quantum literature database.

03:12:39
<transcript>: Now let's get the next one. Right. Hopefully. Okay.

03:12:39
<transcript>: i think we

03:12:44
<transcript>: I think we can get this one right. That would be SSX. We're gonna do it after.

03:12:47
<transcript>: We're gonna after the.

03:12:51
<transcript>: Expiration So FSX.

03:12:51
<transcript>: oh i'm not

03:12:55
<transcript>: Oh, I'm not logging the answer. I'm not logging the answer.

03:12:57
<transcript>: Here, response.

03:13:02
<transcript>: First handle answer right here. I need to log this.

03:13:09
<transcript>: Again.

03:13:09
<transcript>: this is

03:13:13
<transcript>: This is DynamoDB, one of my favorite services.

03:13:22
<transcript>: Correct is true. Expired. Also true. Let's answer this one right at the buzzer. I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is. Open search cloudmap.

03:13:26
<transcript>: Got it. Okay. Did I get it in time.

03:13:28
<transcript>: Correct. I got it in time. Okay.

03:13:31
<transcript>: Deep bracer.

03:13:35
<transcript>: Let's get it right to the buzzer. I'm just trying to test or I'll do it right after the buzzer.

03:13:35
<transcript>: i'm just trying

03:13:46
<transcript>: I'm just trying to test the like, expired. Seems accurate. Yeah. Expired. True. Okay, cool. And then if I get it way before Elemental Server. Oh, that's wrong.

03:13:51
<transcript>: That was Shopping Cart. What is that? Marketplace.

03:13:58
<transcript>: Okay, so that seems to be working. The expiration seems to be working.

03:14:05
<transcript>: I have a mainframe modernization service. That's awesome.

03:14:12
<transcript>: Robo Runner. I don't know. It's clock control, API. No batch.

03:14:16
<transcript>: Okay, time to start looking at the score.

03:14:16
<transcript>: and i

03:14:24
<transcript>: And I rendering it somewhere. So Games should have a score on it for yeah. Okay. So that's a very simplistic.

03:14:24
<transcript>: score

03:14:25
stroopwafel26: Reminds me to modernize my mainframe, thanks!

03:14:26
<transcript>: Score. It's not great.

03:14:26
<transcript>: but

03:14:30
<transcript>: But it's a score. We can start working with it, you know.

03:14:34
<transcript>: So let's see current round we have result.

03:14:36
<transcript>: I'm going to go to.

03:14:39
<transcript>: How do I display the score.

03:14:46
<transcript>: Just like in the top corner for now, the problem is we get rid of the result. I think.

03:14:49
<transcript>: Set results.

03:14:49
<transcript>: yeah so when

03:14:53
<transcript>: Yeah. So when there's a new round, we set result undefined. Maybe we shouldn't.

03:14:57
<transcript>: Like what if we just leave result.

03:15:04
<transcript>: We have to start checking all the places where we reference result.

03:15:07
<transcript>: And here.

03:15:10
<transcript>: Result equals undefined.

03:15:10
<transcript>: so

03:15:14
<transcript>: So that would no longer be the case. We would have to go off something else.

03:15:24
<transcript>: And it's disabled if result is on any so there's some places we'd have to fix things, but maybe we shouldn't get rid of the results because we need to know the game.

03:15:24
<transcript>: or we could

03:15:27
<transcript>: Or we could set games separately.

03:15:30
<transcript>: That's what we'll do. We're gonna store the game separately.

03:15:37
<transcript>: So here we're gonna have Const game set, game.

03:15:38
<transcript>: games around

03:15:38
<transcript>: games around react

03:15:41
<transcript>: Games around React I use steak.

03:15:44
<transcript>: Game do I have like a game.

03:15:52
<transcript>: We'll make it more undefined.

03:15:56
<transcript>: It's like it's gonna be the.

03:15:56
<transcript>: whole like

03:15:57
<transcript>: Whole like.

03:16:00
<transcript>: This result defined.

03:16:08
<transcript>: For mutation here we go. Type game equals infer me.

03:16:10
<transcript>: Output.

03:16:16
<transcript>: No, even better. Well, it's just gonna be a pick now.

03:16:22
<transcript>: Yeah, game new right output.

03:16:24
<transcript>: Game new.

03:16:31
<transcript>: I. D. Name score perfect.

03:16:31
<transcript>: other

03:16:32
<transcript>: Other game type.

03:16:39
<transcript>: Game. So then when we answer.

03:16:45
<transcript>: Here's how we answer. We get a new game back so we can do.

03:16:45
<transcript>: set

03:16:48
<transcript>: Set game equals response. Game.

03:16:54
<transcript>: We did it now we can display the score up here somewhere.

03:16:54
<transcript>: this display

03:16:58
<transcript>: This display. It really ugly. Like until we figure out where we want to put it.

03:17:00
<transcript>: So current round let's see.

03:17:20
<transcript>: I'll put it up there like that for now.

03:17:25
<transcript>: Eks.

03:17:29
<transcript>: Where is it? Oh, it's just. It's not. We can't read it.

03:17:43
<transcript>: There you go. We have a score of one.

03:17:49
<transcript>: Okay. What is that? I don't know. Still score of one. Let's get one right so we can get another.

03:17:49
<transcript>: bill

03:17:51
<transcript>: Billing.

03:17:54

03:18:37
<transcript>: I think I'm gonna have to call it.

03:18:38
2dorkstv: maybe the little lines/seams on it are *just* green enough?

03:18:39
stroopwafel26: the hat is too cool for the greenscreen

03:18:40
<transcript>: It's that topic time of day.

03:18:40
<transcript>: i'm taking notes

03:18:42
creativenull: maybe it's a shade of green?

03:18:44
<transcript>: I'm taking notes this week off because it's my wife's birthday tomorrow. And.

03:18:51
<transcript>: Maybe it's a shade of green, I guess. I mean, it looks like a shade of Tan to me. I don't know.

03:18:51
restarted: this view is a green screen too, right?

03:18:55

<transcript>: I didn't waiting on my face when I say goodbye just feels weird.

03:19:26
<transcript>: Too cool for the green screen. Maybe maybe a little line seams on are just green enough that's that's my guess. I heard you have a new new podcast published two dorks right after you left, you published a new episode.

03:19:30
<transcript>: Those were the days.

<transcript>: I just got everything set up. I took a picture with the camera.

03:21:35
<transcript>: same camera

03:21:37
<transcript>: Same camera that I filmed with right.

03:21:38
tayloreddev: ghost adam

03:21:40
bigdiff___: the lighting is not the same I noticed lol

03:21:41
fragaverage: is anything real anymore?

03:21:42
<transcript>: So now I'm just proud of a green screen ghost. Adam.

03:21:48
fragaverage: living in an illusion

03:21:54
<transcript>: Yeah, it's that quite right, big Diff. It's not quite. There's still some issues. I'll get it perfect. Eventually. It's anything real anymore. Who knows? It's all simulation. Right.

03:21:57
<transcript>: I'm going to.

03:21:57
<transcript>: make it a little better

03:22:03
bigdiff___: your face is a little too bright compared to background

03:22:07
stroopwafel26: The entire universe is a 2D projection anyway

03:22:15
<transcript>: Make it a little better. The quality is not quite right. On the photo. I used my a seven four instead of my a seven s three. So I cheated a little bit because my eight seven s three is kind of back here and it's hard to get to. Yeah, my it's a little too. Yeah. The color like it's not quite realistic. I still got a little bit of a green lip if you see that little green.

03:22:15
<transcript>: edge

03:22:27
<transcript>: Edge on my on my shirt. That's not good. I've tried to shove myself as far away from the green screen as possible. That helps eliminate that great Mount. I've got a camera or I've got a light now. Up here. Oh.

03:22:27
<transcript>: the light

03:22:36
<transcript>: The lighting just did weird stuff. Oh, it's because I had something on my face, and then it went away. So when I have something on my face, I am gonna go here shortly.

03:22:36
<transcript>: like

03:22:40
<transcript>: Like when the get when these glasses are on my face or something.

03:22:45
snowglobe25: What? I couldn't tell lol that you had greenscreen

03:22:49
<transcript>: It's actually the Snap camera, so it's in 720p, which makes the color totally different. Like right now, my shirts actually a lot nicer. It's a lot Blacker.

03:22:49
<transcript>: anyway

03:22:52
<transcript>: Anyway, all these are little things I have to figure out.

03:22:57
<transcript>: But I'm gonna figure them out because I want to have a green screen here so that I can control.

03:22:57
<transcript>: i can put

bigdiff___: I like it, looks nice

03:23:02
