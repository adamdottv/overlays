thesaltsea: where i can find the link guys

00:09:08
grasp5533: $120k/yr is pretty ambitious.

00:09:12
grasp5533: for a junior

00:09:40
grasp5533: Don't want to discourage you, but outside of FAANG that could be hard to find

00:09:51
jiggaman98: Yeahhh, I know.

00:09:58
samhuckaby: I've never heard of a career coach... What do they bring to the table that you would pay them anything for..? Just curious

00:10:06
jiggaman98: I've got a masters degree, and a security clearance.

<transcript>: he's pricey but

00:11:57
andrew8088: hey hey

00:12:10
jiggaman98: @SamHuckaby They help me work on resume, interview prep, mock interviews, find jobs.

00:12:10
<transcript>: You're here. You made it. This is the only place you need to be.

00:12:14
<transcript>: I'm going to turn on music because.

00:12:14

00:12:17
<transcript>: We're just going to be talking for a while, and why not.

00:12:24
<transcript>: Let's see. Don't want to discourage you, but outside of fang, that could be hard to find.

00:12:31
<transcript>: Never heard of a career coach. What do they bring to the table? That you would pay them for anything? That's my question. Sam is here and grasp.

00:12:37
<transcript>: This be your first role. They coach your career. Yo, diamonds. Here. Thank you.

00:12:37
<transcript>: for that

00:12:40
<transcript>: For that very apt description. Diamond.

00:12:43
<transcript>: And I'm going to disappear on a.

00:12:46
jiggaman98: The guy I found costs about $2k for everything.

00:12:47
samhuckaby: @SamHuckaby Ah gotcha. Maybe check with the defense people (Lockheed, Raytheon, etc)

00:12:50
<transcript>: No, Miliro, no, Matt. I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going anywhere. It's been a weird few weeks. I will say.

00:12:57
<transcript>: Had a little work sprint kind of took me out of everything. I think I streamed through some of it.

00:12:57
<transcript>: but it was

00:12:59
<transcript>: But it was tough.

00:12:59
<transcript>: and

00:13:01
<transcript>: And stuff on my family. They're not used to me being.

00:13:03
laame: So, paywall is paying off..

00:13:05
<transcript>: So focused on a problem at work.

00:13:05
<transcript>: and so

00:13:20
<transcript>: And so just like when I'm done working, I'm still thinking about it. And I'm walking around like a zombie. But it's shipped. It's done. We got through the aftermath, just thousands of people online that hate me. But other than that, it all went smoothly. I'm here. These are my friends. This is where I want to be.

00:13:20
<transcript>: just

00:13:23
mehulsharmamat: hello hello!

00:13:27
<transcript>: Just had a little rough patch here, Sam. I could be the five hit answer also worked in it.

00:13:27
<transcript>: five

00:13:31
jiggaman98: @Grasp5533 The career coach says it's possible. I don't wanna dox him, but he's credible.

00:13:31
<transcript>: Five years prior to becoming Software Dev.

00:13:32
mattmancodes: Do you send them pictures of your career and they send advice? LUL

00:13:52
<transcript>: Oh, you almost got it, lena, you were so close to that time. Larry's here. I've got one year professional Dev experience. What's going on, hamster boy? So one thing jigman that's unfortunate about. I think every industry, I don't think this is just unique to software devs. One thing that sucks is depending on how much you make at your current job that will impact how much.

00:13:52
<transcript>: you can make

00:13:58
maleero: It's $20! How can people be upset over $20/month LUL

00:14:02
<transcript>: You can make at your next job because they'll inevitably say, how much do you make now? I don't know why. I don't know why that's a thing. But it's like nobody wants to let anybody jump too far.

00:14:16
<transcript>: If you only make 70k right now, they don't want to be like, okay, let's jump you up to 120. They want to slowly stagger you. I don't know what that is. I don't know if there's, like, a handbook that everyone who employs people.

00:14:18
jiggaman98: I refuse to give my current salary during interviews.

00:14:30
<transcript>: Swears they take a blood oath and they put their hand on it and say that they will never hire anyone or never pay anyone more than 10% of their previous salary. I don't know what it is, but it just seems to be a thing.

00:14:30
<transcript>: you make about

00:14:31
mehulsharmamat: adam srs q about something I'm making: if there was a tool that'

00:14:32
pbertrand_dev: TIP, if they ask your salary convert it to australian dollars first

00:14:33
<transcript>: You make about 80k. Now that was close.

00:14:33
<transcript>: so yeah

00:14:35
<transcript>: So. Yeah, that's the thing.

00:14:35
<transcript>: i'm

00:14:39
jiggaman98: You're not legally obligated to share your salary. So I don't.

00:14:43
<transcript>: I'm afraid it's the thing you could just not tell them, but then they could also just not hire you two. Dorks is here.

00:14:45
grasp5533: @jiggaman98 I was able to make a similar jump from $80k to $120k, but I had several years of experience and led a big project that boosted my confidence significantly

00:14:50
jiggaman98: I ask for salary band.

00:14:50
<transcript>: Whoever's not here say I Tom Dumppins is here. Hey, Hemp yo, welcome to Chat. Hemp.

00:14:52
mattmancodes: just lie about current salary

sockthedev: shhh, don't tell dax 🤫

00:14:58
<transcript>: Hey, Hemp, do I know you hemp? Are you Hemp? David, Hemp? David, Hemp, Hill? Or a different hemp.

00:15:05
<transcript>: Andrew, 80 88 Ad 88 That's fun to say welcome to Chat. Hey, Hey.

00:15:13
heyhemp: I am he. From down the road

00:15:18
<transcript>: They helped me work on. So it's funny. Looks like bertrand tried to win a macbook. I've not seen bertrand grace's presence in Chat. It's okay. I'm not paying attention. Oh, there he is. I'm just way behind. Okay.

00:15:18
<transcript>: just like

00:15:20
schrew: I jumped from 60k to 102k and it was a good time

00:15:24
<transcript>: Just like you're here for the macbook, and then out of here, hamster boy, thank you so much for the prime sub.

00:15:24
<transcript>: prime

00:15:26
<transcript>: Prime. Sub.

<transcript>: What are their credentials? Jigamand how can you ensure that this person.

00:15:49
<transcript>: is legit

00:15:52
mattmancodes: @mattmancodes It's the way to get the salary you want

00:16:04
mehulsharmamat: adam srs q about something I'm making: if there was a tool that'd translate your videos to other languages like french/hindi (indian) to reach local audience (mrbeast once said majority of YT audience dont watch content in english), what would you pay per minute of translation?

00:16:05
<transcript>: Is legit. And could we as twitch chat, just do it for you? Could we just maybe look over your resume? Interview prep you mock interview you. That'd be a fun segment. Let's mock interview people here on my twitch channel oreo milkshake. Thank you for the follow. Also.

00:16:05

00:16:58
<transcript>: lame

00:17:15
<transcript>: Lame is here. So paywall is paying off. I mean, it's doing okay. It's doing better than the people that hate us. Want you to think nobody will pay for that. They say, Sorry, I got a little worked up and I tweeted a thing. And then people thought I was just trying to flex about how much money. I don't care how much money. It's not going to me. I don't get the money.

00:17:15
<transcript>: but

00:17:25
<transcript>: But the point was lots of people signed up for it. Hundreds of people in the first few hours. I mean, it was like, clearly, some people wanted this. I think it's priced too high.

00:17:25
<transcript>: but

00:17:33
<transcript>: But that wasn't up to me. And people still pay for it. So you know what? What am I supposed to do? What am I supposed to tell them it's too expensive? You shouldn't sign up. No.

00:17:33
<transcript>: the

00:17:37
pbertrand_dev: Enough people signed up to buy daddy some new shirts

00:17:40
<transcript>: The career coach says it's possible. I don't want to dox him, but he's credible. Oh, yeah, no, don't, don't juggle, juggerman, don't do that.

00:17:40
<transcript>: do you

00:17:53
<transcript>: Do you send him pictures of your career? And they send advice. Pictures? What? $20? How can people be upset over $20 a month? Well, it is a little high relative to a lot of other things that are subscriptions. Griffith, thank you for the follow.

00:17:53
<transcript>: i refuse

00:18:02
<transcript>: I refuse to give my current salary during interviews. Yeah, just don't tell them, Adam serious question about something I'm making. If there was a tool that. Oh, no, I got to wait for the next message.

th3_l3m0n: Hello o/

00:18:15

00:18:15
<transcript>: i was able

00:18:26
<transcript>: I was able to make a similar jump from eighty K to one hundred and twenty K. But I had several years of experience and led a big project that boosted my confidence significantly. A lot of it is confidence how confidently you enter that interview.

00:18:26
<transcript>: and make

00:18:31
jiggaman98: I found him on LinkedIn, but he thinks I can get the job I want within 6 weeks, even in this market.

00:18:32

derzemba: Heyy

<transcript>: What's going on? How are you, hemp. We need to meet sometime. I feel like we need to. I've met some people here from twitch who are in the area. We got coffee one day. I don't know if you drink coffee. I don't drink coffee, but I do when I go see people because I used to drink coffee. And I love coffee. But my wife doesn't love coffee. So the only time I can drink coffee is when.

00:19:16
<transcript>: i go

00:19:23
<transcript>: I go, like, once in a while, every once in a while, I wander out of the house. It's very rare. But when I do.

00:19:23
<transcript>: it's generally

00:19:29
unrulyhotfixer: I typically don't get my current salary. They generally ask my expected salary range.

00:19:29
<transcript>: It's generally to get coffee with friends. Anyway, that was a lot to say. Hemp, I'd love to meet you sometime. That'd be fun.

00:19:29
<transcript>: we have

00:19:35
<transcript>: We have mechanical keyboards in common. We both love keyboards. We both live in this little corner of the world.

00:19:52
<transcript>: Hamster boy. I already saw that jump from 60 to 102. And it was a good time. That is a good time. Shrew's here stopped lying about two years ago. God blessed me for doing so. Just take my money, hamster boy. Oh, prime sub. Is that Jean.

00:19:52
<transcript>: it's the way

00:19:54
<transcript>: It's the way to get the salary you want.

00:19:56
<transcript>: Just lie about the Grand.

00:20:16
<transcript>: Mayhew. Adam sears question. Oh, here we go, here we go, we're back. I've been waiting for the rest of your message. Mayhel, if there was a tool that translate your videos to other languages, like French, Hindi, to reach local audience. Mr. Beats, once the majority of you two, I just don't watch the content in English. What would you pay per minute of translation? Mayhew, I've heard this about.

00:20:16
<transcript>: mr beast

00:20:25
<transcript>: Mr. Beast that he grew a lot really fast because he literally ported all his videos into native other native languages. How much would I pay.

00:20:27
<transcript>: Right now.

00:20:27
<transcript>: my main problem

00:20:29
<transcript>: My main problem with YouTube is.

00:20:29
<transcript>: making the

00:20:42
jiggaman98: I'm kinda in a situation where if I don't raise my salary, I could lose my house. So, yeah, I've been studying a lot every day. I don't have a choice but to try.

00:20:44
<transcript>: Making the time to make YouTube videos. So I'm not so much thinking about growth. But when I am making a lot of videos and I want them in every language, what would I pay? I'll say this. I paid rev.com for a lot of podcast transcriptions. I want to say.

00:20:44
<transcript>: they're like

00:20:47
<transcript>: They're like a dollar to $2 a minute.

00:20:47
<transcript>: i could

00:20:50
<transcript>: I could be off. I think that's right.

00:20:58
<transcript>: So something like that. Yeah, I would pay that. Now. How would it work? So you would translate an overdub. Wait.

00:21:02
<transcript>: Would it just be other languages? Like.

00:21:02
<transcript>: so

00:21:03
mehulsharmamat: so somewhere bw 0.5-1$ sounds good?

00:21:08
<transcript>: So it would be like overdubbed audio, right? Not just like captions that are transcribed. I'm guessing.

00:21:08
<transcript>: okay i

00:21:12
grasp5533: @jiggaman98 Have you tried asking your current job for a raise?

00:21:14
mattmancodes: They usually ask salary in the UK, you don't have to tell, but if you don't you'll get a rubbish offer - regardless of experience, etc. and it's a waste of time.

00:21:18
<transcript>: Okay, I got to catch up. Reading Names is my favorite segment of the show. No sarcasm. Hey, I'm glad, Sam. I do it. Every show, enough people signed up to buy daddy some new shirts.

00:21:20
<transcript>: What.

00:21:29
<transcript>: You talking about my Tweet. About Todd shelton, the company that dax makes fun of me for the widest Manus company ever.

00:21:29
<transcript>: hello

00:21:38
mehulsharmamat: yeah translation of YOUR VOICE (not AMAZING) but yeah -- for multiple languages. just trying to finish MVP and yeah this is purely for people focused on growth

00:21:41
<transcript>: Hello, the lemon. I found him on LinkedIn, but he thinks I can get the job I want within six weeks, even in this market. Well, it's worth a shot, I guess. Jigga Man. I mean, does he have any guarantees for that fee? I don't know.

00:21:41
<transcript>: there's emba

00:21:51
<transcript>: There's emba. What's going on? Chara is here loving your tweets lately. Me because I feel like my tweets are getting worse all the time.

00:21:51
<transcript>: like

00:21:53
<transcript>: Like I. Tweeted. Yesterday.

00:21:53
<transcript>: about the todd

00:22:01
<transcript>: About the Todd shelton thing. And then immediately, people are like, a little expensive, and it's like, oh, is it? Oh, shoot. I don't know what things cost.

00:22:01
<transcript>: that's like i go

00:22:05
reillyobore: AI is moving towards translated dubbing with perfect lipsync

00:22:10
jiggaman98: @Grasp5533 Yeah, they gave me a 4% raise. I make about $80k year, but I need to make $120k/yr to stay off the street. It's stressful.

00:22:18
mehulsharmamat: but like for eg. im from india, and lot of people dont watch content in english bc a lot of people arent fluent in it. so educational tech content that isn't just tutorials is not something they can benefit from

00:22:19
<transcript>: That's like I go to the grocery store and I have no idea my wife will be like, how much do you think this costs? I don't know. $5 is everything $5. I just don't know. I know. It's a very privileged thing to say. I realize it's not lost on me. Typically don't get my current salary. They generally ask my unexpected. Oh, my expected salary range.

00:22:25
<transcript>: Priv. Thank you so much for the resub. Three months. No. Macbook. Scams. Maybe.

00:22:27
<transcript>: That's funny.

00:22:27
<transcript>: i'm kind of

00:22:42
<transcript>: I'm kind of in a situation where if I don't raise my salary, I could lose my house. So, yeah, I've been studying a lot every day. Oh, jeez, don't have a try a choice but to try derzimba. Thank you for the prime sub. Three prime subs. That's a prime pet trick.

00:22:44
<transcript>: A Hat Prime. Sub. Hat trick.

00:22:44
<transcript>: got to have

00:22:47

<transcript>: Somewhere between 0.5 and one dollars. Sounds good. Yeah. No, for sure. Mayhew.

00:22:54
<transcript>: i think

00:22:59
<transcript>: I think if you could just clarify. Oh, yeah, you did. Down here. Translation.

00:23:05
<transcript>: Of your voice not amazing, but yeah. Oh, you're using the AI voice things.

00:23:06
<transcript>: Interesting.

00:23:16
<transcript>: It wouldn't be perfect. But over time, that trends to be higher quality. That's a great idea. Mayhew, that's a fantastic idea. And the little bit I know about you.

00:23:16
<transcript>: you're really good

00:23:19
samhuckaby: @mehulsharmamat how long are the kind of videos that you want to target to translate?

00:23:27
<transcript>: You're really good at Twitter. You're really good at YouTube. You're probably really good at building products too. You should make this product. I will be your first customer and you can put that in writing. Pier as thank you for the follow.

00:23:36
<transcript>: They usually ask salary. In the UK. You don't have to tell, but if you don't, you'll get a rubbish offer, regardless of experience, et cetera. It's a waste time. Yeah, that's what I worry.

00:23:38
mehulsharmamat: @SamHuckaby any timing. im doing dynamic pricing for now

00:23:42
<transcript>: Genesis. Thank you for that. Follow.

00:23:47
bananscode: I feel fancy when I enter this stream

00:23:49
bananscode: why

00:23:57
mehulsharmamat: thanks so much @adamdotdev but yeah ill shoot you a dm to try it out!

00:24:02
<transcript>: Ai is moving towards translated dubbing with perfect lip sync. Yeah, it's going to just keep trending better. So I'm all for this idea. May hole. I think it's fantastic. Also, Riley obore welcome to my chat. Welcome, welcome. They gave me a 4% raise. I make about eighty K a year, but I need to make 120 to stay off the street. It's stressful OOH jigga. Do you have any other living options.

00:24:05
<transcript>: Because it's very stressful.

00:24:08
<transcript>: To have basic needs.

00:24:08
<transcript>: under

00:24:10
<transcript>: Under Financial duress.

00:24:17
<transcript>: And it'll just add a lot of pressure to things like interviews, like when you're interviewing, you don't want to be thinking about being on the Street.

00:24:17
<transcript>: that will not play well

00:24:23
mehulsharmamat: @SamHuckaby the first one ill try it own is my own :P

00:24:34
<transcript>: That will not play well in an interview. You want to enter into a situation like getting a new job from a position of leverage where you don't need it. You really don't like genuinely in your own heart and mind. You know, you don't need this job, but it might be nice to take a different job.

00:24:34
<transcript>: that's when

00:24:38
<transcript>: That's when you're going to have the confidence to really sell yourself.

00:24:43
<transcript>: If you're really needing something like more money because.

00:24:43
<transcript>: you're in

00:24:47
<transcript>: You're in tough financial situation. It's going to make it really difficult.

00:24:47
<transcript>: to go

00:25:06
<transcript>: To go out and get that job you want. I think that's just my experience. I make the most money in my career when I don't need anything like when I haven't needed new work and people really want me to do it for them, that's when they pay me a lot of money to do it. So I think that would play here as well. And I wonder if there's a way you can get into a cheaper living situation.

00:25:06
<transcript>: not

00:25:12
tini_turner: @SamHuckaby i wonder how the memes translate in other languages and retain context

00:25:24
<transcript>: Not that that's the right move. I'm just saying, like if there's any other ways to relieve the financial stress that will help you in getting better opportunities. I think because I just think it's tough psychologically, when you're struggling financially or when you really need something, it's tough to get what you really want out of it.

00:25:28
samhuckaby: @SamHuckaby Gotcha. I could honestly see going higher being worthwhile then, since most people will probably be translating videos that are 5ish minutes. just my opinion, I'd go closer to $2/minute.

00:25:28
<transcript>: Okay mayhew. But like, for example, I'm from India.

00:25:37
<transcript>: And a lot of people don't watch content in English because a lot of people aren't fluent in it. So educational tech content that isn't just tutorials is not something they can benefit from.

00:25:57
<transcript>: So yes. Mayhew I love this idea. So much of the dev community is global. And I've thought that just from being on Twitter, so many of the people that follow me on Twitter are all over the place. And so anytime I do anything, I do want it to be consumable by all those people. But it's also a lot of work for me to go out and try and make each video. And I hardly have time or make time to make.

00:25:57
<transcript>: any

00:26:06
<transcript>: Any video to make them all internationalized. It's just a hard thing. But if there were services or a service that could do that for me. I'm all for it. I love it.

00:26:13
<transcript>: Is this the Versailleship roast party? No, we're not going to roast it. We're just going to watch it together.

00:26:13
<transcript>: i have no

00:26:18
jiggaman98: Thanks Adam, I'm trying. I have until August to fix this problem, or it's basically the apocalypse for me.

00:26:18
<transcript>: I have no idea what they're shipping today. I'm excited because it's a surprise. I love surprises.

00:26:18
<transcript>: and

00:26:19
mehulsharmamat: @SamHuckaby yep yep im thinking a small flat fee then per minute.

00:26:27
<transcript>: And there's been mixed. We should talk about what's been announced so far because I honestly don't know. I was off the internet yesterday. I'd like to know heading into today's.

00:26:28
mehulsharmamat: anyway love the feedback tysm @SamHuckaby

00:26:29
<transcript>: What have I missed.

00:26:29
<transcript>: how long

00:26:33
dmmulroy: Howdy y'all

00:26:41
<transcript>: How long? The kind of videos you want to target? Translate. Any timing. I'm doing dynamic pricing. For now. I feel fancy when I enter this stream, you feel fancy. Banana, bananas, fancy.

00:26:41
<transcript>: why

00:26:46
<transcript>: Why? Why do you feel fancy? I don't know. I'd like to know, though.

00:26:46
<transcript>: thanks so much

00:26:47
mehulsharmamat: im gonna hit the vscoding and try to get it out asap

00:26:52
<transcript>: Thanks so much. Yeah, I'll shoot you a dm try it out. Yes, please do. Mayhew I love it first one. I'll try.

00:26:57
<transcript>: It own is my own. Oh, by the way, Mayhew I went to look at your YouTube channel. I think I've already seen all your videos. So.

00:26:57
<transcript>: i wasn't two out

00:27:06
<transcript>: I wasn't two out of three or whatever. I think I've watched them all. So I need more. I need you to make more because they're very good. And I think you said you were working on one. I'm very excited for it.

00:27:11
<transcript>: I wonder how the memes translate into the language and retain context. That's a great question.

00:27:14
<transcript>: Could honestly see going higher being worth it.

00:27:14
<transcript>: thanks ad

00:27:27
<transcript>: Thanks, Adam. I'm trying. I have until August fixed this problem, or it's basically the apocalypse. Oh, gee, see, you don't want that pressure. I know that's easier said than done to just alleviate all that pressure, but you got to figure out a way.

00:27:27
<transcript>: to be going

00:27:30
<transcript>: To be going into the job market from a position of strength.

00:27:30
<transcript>: it's just

00:27:33
<transcript>: It's just always going to work out better, I think.

00:27:35
<transcript>: I could be wrong.

00:27:38
<transcript>: You could still in your desperation.

00:27:38
<transcript>: pull it

00:27:46
<transcript>: Pull it off. I just think it's a lot easier to get what you want out of relationships or contracts or employment.

00:27:53
jiggaman98: You're right Adam.

00:28:06
<transcript>: When you don't need that thing, if that makes sense, okay, thing is Spotify flee, then per minute. Yes. Love the feedback. So like, Mayhew I pay for podcast transcription or not transcriptions? Podcast editing? Chris, edits our podcast and it's per minute. But there's a minimum. So there's, like every episode he has a minimum fee. So if you do, like a ten minute episode, you're at least paying.

00:28:06
<transcript>: him

00:28:09
<transcript>: Him X, and then per minute after that.

00:28:09
<transcript>: if that helps

00:28:11
mattmancodes: that pressure could also lead to accepting a horrible job just because it pays what you need.

00:28:18
<transcript>: If that helps, I don't know what's up, Diamol Roy, How's it going? Going to hit the Vs coding? Try to get it out asap. Please do.

00:28:24
<transcript>: The pressure could also lead to accepting a horrible job. That because it pays what you need. That's also true.

00:28:24
<transcript>: just

00:28:25
<transcript>: Just.

00:28:25
<transcript>: your opportunity set

00:28:30
<transcript>: Your opportunity set will look a lot nicer when you don't need any of the opportunities.

00:28:31
parkour_peter: Hello everyone!

00:28:36
dmmulroy: @jiggaman98 I've used and worked with a really great recruiter (hard to come by) for my last job hunt - I can connect y'all if you're interested. He really advocated for me to land the highest salary/benefits possible

00:28:36
<transcript>: Generally, that's been the case for me in my career. Okay. Let's talk about Versailleship so far.

00:28:36
<transcript>: get my

00:28:41
<transcript>: Get my speed who's kept up I saw the storage stuff the first day.

00:28:48
<transcript>: But it's now Thursday. What other stuff has been released? I've just seen the storage stuff, so hit me.

00:28:48
<transcript>: somebody

00:28:49
<transcript>: Somebody.

00:28:52
<transcript>: Parkour. Peters. Here.

00:28:54
pirazgg: security

00:28:57
<transcript>: I've used them work with a really great recruiter. Hard to come by for my last job. Hunt.

00:28:57
<transcript>: i

00:29:02
<transcript>: I can connect oh, jeez, I almost dropped my wire. I can connect you all if you're interested, you really advocate for me.

00:29:03
krunal_dev: 2nd was security

00:29:05
jiggaman98: @dmmulroy Sure! Can you DM me the info?

00:29:10
dmmulroy: Absolutely

00:29:11
<transcript>: Purizag. Welcome to Chat. Same with for crew. Now.

00:29:11
<transcript>: security

00:29:20
grasp5533: I just got a deposit down for Seattle.  About to move from East Coast to West Coast

00:29:20
<transcript>: Security. Second was security. What is security? They're going to give you security now in versaille. That's good. Can someone give me more details.

00:29:20
krunal_dev: Firewalls

00:29:24
<transcript>: Because I don't know. I thought we already had security.

00:29:32
hugueshs: "Visual editing" for CMS if you use Vercel, Next.js, Sanity and Enterprise client

00:29:32
<transcript>: Absolutely. I just got a deposit down for cl about maybe for East Coast West Coast firewalls. Okay, so they're reselling.

00:29:32
<transcript>: waf i don't mean that in a

00:29:38
<transcript>: Waf. I don't mean that in a condescending way, just like they're reselling another aws service or a collapse service.

00:29:38
<transcript>: okay

00:29:46
<transcript>: Okay, firewalls Cool Visual editing for cms if you use versaille nextjs, sanity and Enterprise client.

00:29:51
jiggaman98: I've been holding this in for like 6 months, idk why I'm sharing it now. Probably b/c I'm running out of time.

00:29:51
<transcript>: Okay, hugo. Or Hugoosh, welcome to my chat.

00:29:57
<transcript>: So you have to be an Enterprise Versaille client, but you get visual editing for your CMS.

00:29:57
<transcript>: visual ed

00:30:00
<transcript>: Visual editing. Okay. So I've got content.

00:30:00
<transcript>: in a cms

00:30:11
<transcript>: In a cms like sanity, but now I can visually edit on the site instead of in the sanity. The sanity UI is slow. I don't know. Everyone praises sanity so much and I get it.

00:30:11
<transcript>: i guess

00:30:19
<transcript>: I guess it's developer first, or it's like they've done a good job on that front. But man, the editor is slow. It feels bad using it.

00:30:19
<transcript>: so that's

00:30:24
<transcript>: So that's nice if you can just visually edit the site. That's cool.

00:30:24
<transcript>: but you have to be

00:30:31
<transcript>: But you have to be an enterprise client, which means at least a few thousand dollars a month. So that's interesting. They're not just hoping that up to everybody.

00:30:31
<transcript>: been hold

00:30:37
<transcript>: Been holding this in for, like, six months. I don't know why I'm sharing it now. Probably because I'm running out of time. Yeah. Jigga man.

00:30:37
<transcript>: you can

00:30:40
<transcript>: You can DM me on discord.

00:30:40
<transcript>: the discord

00:30:42
<transcript>: The discord is Watch Dev.

00:30:42
<transcript>: happy

00:30:44
adamdotdev: !discord

fossabot: Adam is a member of the watch.dev Discord server and he'd love to see you there: https://discord.gg/watchdotdev

00:30:44
<transcript>: Happy to talk through.

00:30:50
<transcript>: Oh, man, I just realized there's so many DMs I haven't read and respond to yet, and I'm asking for more DMs.

00:30:52
grasp5533: @jiggaman98 It honestly sounds like you need to move.  I know we probably don't have all the details

00:31:02
<transcript>: But not say that it sounds like I think I'm special. I don't think I'm special. I just think I get a lot of anxiety over reading my dms because then I feel like if I don't do the thing that the person wants right then I'll forget. And it's now.

00:31:02
<transcript>: a thing

00:31:05
<transcript>: A thing that's just going to fall off anyway.

00:31:05
<transcript>: happy

00:31:10
<transcript>: Happy to talk outside of this and just would love to explore.

00:31:10
<transcript>: what

00:31:12
<transcript>: What your situation is.

00:31:12
<transcript>: how

00:31:16
<transcript>: How immovable some of those things are like your house situation.

00:31:16
<transcript>: you have family

00:31:17
<transcript>: You have family.

00:31:24
<transcript>: Just like understanding some of that. I could give you a little better advice, but I don't expect you to type it all out in Twitch chat either.

00:31:24
<transcript>: honestly sounds like

00:31:30
<transcript>: Honestly. Sounds like you need to move. I know. We probably don't have all the details. Yeah, it's hard without all the contacts.

00:31:35
<transcript>: But I feel for you. I've had some moments in my career that were very stressful.

00:31:35
<transcript>: and finan

00:31:37

<transcript>: Okay, so, Versailles.

00:31:42
<transcript>: we've got

00:31:42
jiggaman98: @Grasp5533 Long story short, I accumulated debt and the payments are putting me in the red.

00:31:48
<transcript>: We've got firewalls, we've got visual editing? Is there anything else that's been announced? That I've missed.

00:31:55
<transcript>: Long story short, I accumulated debt and the payments are putting me in the red oof.

00:31:55
<transcript>: debt

00:31:57
<transcript>: Debt is another situation.

00:32:03
krunal_dev: They are releasing something called actions today, right?

00:32:05
<transcript>: The good news is you're in a good profession. I mean, being a developer, having a year of experience.

00:32:10
<transcript>: There's definitely hope. But it's tough. Debt is tough.

00:32:13
pbertrand_dev: Since you are giving tips. My mother in law is staying at my place for the coming 2 months. How  do I cope?

00:32:14
<transcript>: Let's see. They're releasing something called Actions today. Right.

00:32:14
<transcript>: oh

00:32:21
<transcript>: Oh, that's right. In their own documentation for the storage stuff. They said they were announcing Thursday. Actions, Server actions.

00:32:27
<transcript>: Since you were giving tips, my mother in law is staying at my place for the coming two months. How do I cope.

00:32:27
<transcript>: bert

00:32:29
<transcript>: Bertrand.

00:32:32

pbertrand_dev: 70 m2

00:32:39
<transcript>: How big a place are we talking hide as much as possible.

00:32:42
<transcript>: When my mother in law comes over.

00:32:45
<transcript>: 70.

00:32:49
<transcript>: M. Two. What is that? Is that a measurement.

00:32:53
<transcript>: Meter squared 70 meters.

00:32:55
<transcript>: Three times.

00:32:55
<transcript>: two

00:32:58
<transcript>: 210ft.

00:32:58
pbertrand_dev: Yes

00:33:00
<transcript>: Did I get that right.

00:33:00
<transcript>: okay

00:33:03
<transcript>: Okay. 210ft.

pbertrand_dev: 753.473729 square feet

00:33:10
<transcript>: How many rooms? How many separate rooms are we talking? 753 sqft.

00:33:29
jiggaman98: Thx everybody, my plan was to finish up the LeetCode problem set I'm doing, and then start a job search in June.

00:33:30
<transcript>: When my mother in law comes over, I actually end up getting to do a lot more work and stuff because my wife will just be with my mother in law and the kids, and I'm just kind of around. If I'm up there, I might as well just be down here working. Dave, thank you for the follow. So that's how I cope and not that I don't like. I love being around my mother in law. She's a good time.

00:33:30
<transcript>: but

00:33:36
mattmancodes: My mother in law doesn't speak English so it's easy...

00:33:38
grasp5533: When are we getting the wife on stream

00:33:41
<transcript>: But I do end up working more. Maybe that's coping. I don't know. Andrew, thank you so much for the follow. Thanks, everybody. My plan was to finish up the leak code problems that I'm doing and then start my job search in June.

00:33:41
<transcript>: my

00:33:52
<transcript>: My mother in law doesn't speak English, so it's easy. That would make it easier. When are we getting the wife on stream? Oh, yeah. I should do the dax thing and have, like, a family meeting. My wife and I don't have family meetings.

00:33:55
pbertrand_dev: I love it too, its just a small space and a long time. She's staying here to take a break from the war

00:33:58
<transcript>: So it would be very disingenuous for us to start having them on Twitch because it would be fake.

00:33:58
<transcript>: also

00:34:00
lesabotsy: Hi Adam, hi all :)

00:34:03
<transcript>: Also I have two kids, so if she's on stream with me.

00:34:03
<transcript>: that means

00:34:10
<transcript>: That means somebody needs to be watching the kids. Now, my parents come over sometimes and watch the kids. We could do that. We could do it.

00:34:10
<transcript>: it's

00:34:15
<transcript>: It's a theoretical possibility. I'll have to see if she's ready for a life of stardom.

00:34:15
<transcript>: and han

00:34:17
grasp5533: Do you not have the nanny anymore?

00:34:18
<transcript>: And hanging out with 100 people on twitch. We'll see.

00:34:27
<transcript>: Love it too. It's just a small space. In a long time. She's staying here to take a break from the war. Oh, jeez, bertrand. I'm realizing.

00:34:31
<transcript>: I don't know your situation.

00:34:31
<transcript>: are you in

00:34:33
<transcript>: Are you in Ukraine.

00:34:40
<transcript>: Do you live in Ukraine? Bertrand? Did I know this about you? Or which war.

00:34:42
pbertrand_dev: no thats where my wifes family is from

00:34:48
<transcript>: Hi, Adam. Lesa botsy. What's going on? Lesa, do you not have the nanny anymore? Oh, we have the nanny. Yeah, no, that's where my wife samly, is from.

00:34:48
<transcript>: oh

00:34:50
<transcript>: Oh, I see.

00:34:56
<transcript>: You said they're getting away. We do have the nanny. She doesn't watch the kids so much.

00:34:56
<transcript>: so

00:35:00
<transcript>: So nanny is kind of the wrong word. She's more of like.

00:35:00
<transcript>: a

00:35:02
<transcript>: A Home assistant.

00:35:06
<transcript>: She does a lot of cleaning and a lot of.

00:35:13
<transcript>: The chores around the house, but doesn't spend as much time mostly so that my wife can be with the boys.

00:35:20
<transcript>: Not that she couldn't like the boys love her. And they could play. No. Yeah, it could happen. It's more a question. If my wife wants to. Come on.

<transcript>: Adam staff? What my staff? Do you play any chess? I don't play chess. Should I play chess.

00:36:27
<transcript>: how much do

00:36:37
<transcript>: How much do versaille want to be Apple? They definitely have that going in their marketing, don't they? It was some nice critics regarding versaille pricing.

00:36:39
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:36:39
<transcript>: the

00:36:43
privann: https://twitter.com/MelkeyDev/status/1653498934491516928

00:36:59
<transcript>: The source thing was a little surprising to me. So when I first hit the storage announcement, this is where they said server actions, right? They put it in a caption. Oh, they removed it. Oh, they removed it. Did I see something fancy and got a leak before anyone knew? Because it said something down here, like we're announcing Thursday actions. But now they've removed it.

00:36:59
<transcript>: anyway

00:37:09
pbertrand_dev: they unannounced it

00:37:10
<transcript>: Anyway, yeah. I was a little surprised to see it's, just like they're repackaging. I thought they actually built something that sounds so condescending, but honestly, I thought, like, oh, they actually built some cool stuff.

00:37:14
<transcript>: No, they're repurposing and upselling.

00:37:14
<transcript>: three different

00:37:14
tini_turner: it is already thursday?

00:37:14
mattmancodes: haha

00:37:16
<transcript>: Three different services.

00:37:16
<transcript>: so

00:37:18
<transcript>: So I guess.

00:37:18
<transcript>: that's a move

00:37:21
<transcript>: That's a move. They unannounced. It okay.

00:37:27
<transcript>: What's this? Milky tweet? Priv Milky tweet? I like Milky.

00:37:31
<transcript>: Apple Energy I Web hose? Yeah.

00:37:31
<transcript>: so this was

00:37:32
charafmrah: Give it a try (chess(), could be a fun stream with other tech streamers 👀

00:37:34
<transcript>: So this was automated. Make this right.

00:37:36
<transcript>: So where is the link.

00:37:39
extremelyryan: hey Adam! happy star wars day

00:37:40
<transcript>: Where is the link to it.

00:37:40
<transcript>: service markup

00:37:43
<transcript>: Service. Markup. Oversell. Here we go. Yeah.

00:37:43
<transcript>: so

00:37:46
privann: Look at my answer

00:37:49
<transcript>: So this is definitely a thing. I love that he made this because it's so helpful to see the actual markup on everything.

00:37:55
<transcript>: Versaille blob pricing is in beta. Okay.

00:37:55
<transcript>: is that after

00:37:58
<transcript>: Is that after Lerob spoke with him, it's beta.

00:37:58
<transcript>: pricing

00:38:01
<transcript>: Pricing is Beta. Okay.

00:38:01
<transcript>: look at your

00:38:01
privann: https://twitter.com/emil_priver/status/1653499225387290643

00:38:03
<transcript>: Look at your answerpriv.

00:38:10
mattmancodes: even better that it's hosted on Vercel

00:38:10
<transcript>: Oh, you mean your. Oh, you had an answer to that? Oh, yeah. Let's see this.

00:38:10
<transcript>: let's

00:38:12
<transcript>: Let's see this.

00:38:18
<transcript>: No Versaille postgres promax.

00:38:18
<transcript>: that was

00:38:23
<transcript>: That was a good one. That was a good one. Marcel postgres, ultra.

00:38:25
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:38:25
<transcript>: it's interesting

00:38:31
<transcript>: It's interesting. I hadn't really thought through the fact that versaille hasn't really made a lot of complicated infrastructure.

00:38:36
<transcript>: They've mostly just packaged up a bunch of primitives, not a bad thing.

00:38:41
<transcript>: It's great business in terms of like they know what their costs are, and they just resell them.

00:38:41
<transcript>: at a

00:38:43
<transcript>: At a markup. Makes sense.

00:38:43
<transcript>: security so

00:38:45
<transcript>: Security. So let's read this announcement.

00:38:45
<transcript>: introducing

00:38:58
<transcript>: Introducing versailles firewall and versailles Secure compute bring more improper grade offerings for enhanced security of your applications infrastructure from the wrap ups between villagers and revision. Okay, diversion of tools. So what is this here.

00:38:58
<transcript>: secure

00:38:59
<transcript>: Secure compute.

00:39:02
<transcript>: Secure Connections https.

00:39:02
<transcript>: and secure

00:39:07
<transcript>: And secure, compute. What just like VPCs.

00:39:10
<transcript>: What is it.

00:39:10
<transcript>: twenty

00:39:13
<transcript>: 20 builds a place in a private network. Okay, so.

00:39:13
<transcript>: they're

00:39:16
<transcript>: They're reselling vpcs. Cool. Okay.

00:39:18
<transcript>: Makes sense.

00:39:18
<transcript>: you can connect

00:39:25
<transcript>: You can connect your verte app just like you can a lambda function. Okay, cool. And then the firewall. Is this waf or is it Cloudflare.

00:39:25
<transcript>: we're under

00:39:32
<transcript>: We're under correct and accessible. They also become more vulnerable to external threats. Among these threats, distributed denial of service tax.

00:39:40
<transcript>: Yeah. I wonder how much this was like they had a few people get ddos on versailles, and it was like, we don't have a plan. What do we do.

00:39:40
<transcript>: what are we doing

00:39:48
<transcript>: What are we doing? This scenario. So they were manually dealing with it. Now we'll just repurpose and resell waf makes sense.

00:39:50
lesabotsy: @adamdotdev I'm done with my 2 introductory courses on programming (via my self made bootcamp). I'm going to start learning web dev now. Do you have any idea what stack has the most jobs so I could focus on that?

00:39:52
<transcript>: Custom new custom firewall rules for IP blocking light restrict access.

00:39:54
<transcript>: Okay.

00:39:54
<transcript>: cool

00:39:57
<transcript>: Cool authentication and authorization. Okay.

00:40:11
<transcript>: Thanks to a new era of robust developer first tooling like authorc and auth Zero, you can manage auth with just a few lines of code. This isn't so much an announcement, right? They're just saying you have options.

00:40:11
<transcript>: continuous monit

00:40:19
<transcript>: Continuous Monitoring and audits, versailles Monitoring and logs. Is that new? Or are they just saying they did this a while ago.

00:40:19
<transcript>: okay

00:40:21
<transcript>: Okay, that's enough of security.

00:40:27
<transcript>: So that was day two. And then day three, collaborate.

00:40:33
<transcript>: Versaillespaces. And Visual Editing. Okay, tell me more, tell me more.

00:40:48
<transcript>: Less about the I'm done with my two introductory courses on programming via my self made boot camp. I'm going to start learning web Dev now. Do you have any idea what Stack has the most job so I can focus on that lesa. I think React is pretty hot in the job market. From everything I hear.

00:40:49
krunal_dev: Theo got ddos very bad on vercel

00:40:54
<transcript>: I think I don't have not done a lot of that.

00:40:54
<transcript>: extremely

00:40:58
<transcript>: Extremely, Ryan. Happy Star Wars Day? Is it Star Wars day.

00:41:03
<transcript>: What is Star Wars Day? Today is Star Wars day.

00:41:03
<transcript>: give it

00:41:10
<transcript>: Give it a try. Chess could be a fun stream with their tech streamers. Oh, that would be interesting, chara. I like it.

00:41:14
<transcript>: Even better that it's hosted on Versailles.

00:41:14
<transcript>: theo got

00:41:15
<transcript>: Theo got.

00:41:16
maleero: May the Fourth be with you, Adam!

00:41:16
sockthedev: May the 4th adam

00:41:17
mattmancodes: Yeah, React. It's the frontend of choice for most places

00:41:20
<transcript>: Ddos very bad on versailles. Yeah. And he was able to just.

00:41:20
<transcript>: text

00:41:23
pirazgg: funny how vercel need to create a managed service to be vetted by JavaScript community, now Postgres is a thingy

00:41:25
<transcript>: Text Rob, Lee, Rob, and be like, hey, I'm getting ddos, and they fixed it.

00:41:25
<transcript>: but

00:41:32
<transcript>: But that doesn't scale lerob can't always be the one that has to fix ddosing tonal. Thank you for the follow.

00:41:38
<transcript>: Okay. So what is this? Versaille spaces. Did I click on it? Did I actually click on it.

00:41:54
<transcript>: Quality software at Scale with versailles Spaces unite your team with powerful tools and conventions for better collaboration and faster iteration in large code bases. As companies and codebases grow, it becomes hard to sustain a fast release cycle without letting air slip into production.

00:42:11
<transcript>: Biggest evolution of versailles workflow yet powerful tools and conventions designed to integrate with your mono repo setup to help you scale efficiently while retaining quality. Okay, what does it do you'll find insights on your development, workflows, code, health, and build blogs and brand new functionality to boost efficiency and remove blockers with conformance.

00:42:11
<transcript>: code

00:42:15
<transcript>: Code Owners and versailles runs.

00:42:15
<transcript>: okay

00:42:16
<transcript>: Okay.

00:42:23
<transcript>: These products, currently available in early private beta for enterprises, can be used with versailles regardless of where you host your application.

00:42:29
<transcript>: Okay. So you have it on github. That's an interesting point. Why does A. Versaille just have their own.

00:42:29
<transcript>: git

00:42:38
<transcript>: Git. Why not just don't need github, just use for I guess that's a lot of stuff they'd have to build out a lot of functionality they don't necessarily need.

00:42:38
<transcript>: pull requ

00:42:42
<transcript>: Pull requests and all that stuff. But it seems like they're kind of like, I don't know.

00:42:42
<transcript>: when

00:42:45
andrew8088: so its github actions?

00:42:49
<transcript>: When they say code owners, it makes me think of that weekly runs. So it's just like your ci stuff.

00:42:49
<transcript>: conform

00:42:50
<transcript>: Conformance score.

00:42:50
<transcript>: okay

00:42:54
mattmancodes: they could resell github

00:42:58
<transcript>: Okay, this is cool rematching for sell for large code bases teams need a single place. Find information about It code owners and build logs.

00:43:01
<transcript>: Mono repos.

00:43:07
<transcript>: So it's got like mono repo awareness here in the ui. Is that what I'm seeing? Acme font.

00:43:11
<transcript>: I don't know what I'm looking at here.

00:43:19
<transcript>: So runs. So this is a space. Oh, Acme front. So this is one space. And there's multiple repos.

00:43:19
<transcript>: maybe

00:43:20
<transcript>: Maybe.

00:43:24
sockthedev: remember when vercel used to be simple?

00:43:25
<transcript>: Okay, better best practice. Conforms for your code.

00:43:30
<transcript>: Conformance Automatic detection of critical issues for your front end products early in the development.

00:43:42
mattmancodes: that was their selling point, wasn't it?

00:43:45
<transcript>: Very cool. I'm excited about this. I want to read more, but I'm excited. So it's GitHub actions. Oh, is that your take? I was not my take but maybe may the fourth be with you may 4? I got you may the fourth.

00:43:58
<transcript>: Star Wars Day that's a good 1 May the fourth. Yeah react it's the front end of choice for most places. Funnel versailles need to create a managed service to be vetted by javascript community. Now postgres is a thingy.

00:44:06
<transcript>: They could resell github. There you go. Hey, there you go. They can just resell github. Feel like they could just do that.

00:44:06
<transcript>: remember

00:44:09
<transcript>: Remember what Versaille used to be simple.

00:44:09
<transcript>: yeah

00:44:16
<transcript>: Yeah, the problem. Sock versailles. I'm actually surprised if this taking them this long to branch into some other things.

00:44:16
<transcript>: especially since

00:44:31
<transcript>: Especially since they're just reselling stuff like you didn't even have to build anything. They said, work out deals and do some marketing. I'm surprised that they've been front end hosting only for so long because it's just not very good business. People don't expect to pay a lot of money for their front end hosting, especially.

00:44:31
<transcript>: it's just hard for

00:44:38
<transcript>: It's just hard for me to weigh out. Like, what am I getting here when I use versaille on a project that has legs with multiple people working on it for years.

00:44:38
<transcript>: it's just

00:44:42
<transcript>: It's just hard to justify the cost. So.

00:44:42
<transcript>: it's kind of surprised

00:44:45
<transcript>: It's kind of surprised to me that they've been front end hosting only for so long.

00:44:49
<transcript>: But yeah, it did used to be simple.

00:44:52
<transcript>: Okay.

00:44:52
<transcript>: yeah

00:44:56
<transcript>: Yeah, that was your selling point. Yeah, it's a bad selling point because life is not simple.

00:44:56
<transcript>: project

00:45:01
<transcript>: Projects are not simple, they're complicated. And if you want to really add value.

00:45:01
<transcript>: you're going to have to

00:45:22
<transcript>: You're going to have to wait into that muck, and you're going to have to like, granted, you can have a simple product that makes other complex things simpler. But it doesn't all just go away and to just be front end hosting and hook up your GitHub repo, deploy your thing. I just don't think it's a viable long term business model, at least not a 300 million dollar raise, whatever their valuation was.

00:45:22
<transcript>: that's just

00:45:26
<transcript>: That's just untenable. They had to do something else. I think.

00:45:26
<transcript>: okay

00:45:27
<transcript>: Okay.

00:45:27
<transcript>: brazil

00:45:41
<transcript>: Brazil Runs, offers a better solution and a new system for sending users build from any tool, local, continuous integration, or deployments to or sell free visualization all in one dashboard. You get an easier way to debug a task or an interact ui. Okay, interesting. It's interesting.

00:45:45
<transcript>: I'm intrigued. I'm intrigued. About versailles. Spaces.

00:45:55
<transcript>: Storage is kind of meh like, I know how to use those things if I wanted to use them. If I wanted to use neon, I would use neon. I've used up stash. It's great.

00:45:59
<transcript>: I don't need to pay more to versaille to use those things.

00:45:59
<transcript>: i don't care

00:46:02
nexxeln: hii adam

00:46:09
<transcript>: I don't care if their library makes me go from five lines of code to three. I'm good, I'm good. I'm going to pay the normal prices. Next is here. What's up, Nick.

00:46:13
<transcript>: We're getting ready to do some versailleship.

00:46:13
<transcript>: live react

00:46:23
<transcript>: Live reactions. We're going to watch together. Whoever's interested in that is dax still streaming. We talked about one of us rating the other so we can consolidate.

00:46:25
nexxeln: im interested

00:46:27
<transcript>: Let me tell me if he's streaming while I do this.

00:46:32
<transcript>: While I eat? Because I'm hungry. Uhoh, what did I just do.

00:46:32
<transcript>: it just went

00:46:34
<transcript>: It just went to the wrong camera.

00:46:34
<transcript>: it's

00:46:36
sockthedev: i built a product on their container platform (Zeit), then they did the whole serverless frontend switch and i basically had to rewrite. that pushed me into looking for an alt. stoked i then bumped into sst.

00:46:36
<transcript>: It's okay.

00:46:36
<transcript>: it's

00:46:38
unrulyhotfixer: he is streaming

<transcript>: It's fine, it's fine.

00:46:40

00:46:46
<transcript>: Are you streaming.

00:46:49
kevinnaughtonjr: we need a sponsorship for this bar company

00:46:50
<transcript>: What are you interested in? Next? You're interested.

00:46:50
<transcript>: i built a product

00:46:53
<transcript>: I built a product on their container platform.

00:46:53
<transcript>: z

00:46:53
unrulyhotfixer: he is raiding you

00:46:58
<transcript>: Z and they do the whole serverless front end switch. And I basically had to rewrite bummer.

00:46:58
<transcript>: and

00:47:01
<transcript>: And that pushed you to sst. So there you go.

00:47:01
<transcript>: it

00:47:01
nexxeln: interested in vercel ship

00:47:04
<transcript>: It all worked out in the end. Sock.

<transcript>: Yeah. Get rid of that. And then we can just talk. I just want to talk for a minute because I feel like.

01:17:46
<transcript>: i'm

01:17:50

teej_dv: LUL

01:17:57
tvitchnam: call teej

01:18:11
<transcript>: I need you to make this make sense to me. First of all, what are server actions? Because I know other frameworks have this, and I don't understand what they are. How is it different than functions in your lib directory that you call from api Gateway or from api routes or something? If we're sticking with nextjs How's it different than that.

01:18:14
naxodev: anticlimatic

01:18:17
<transcript>: So you just put it in your component.

01:18:22
pirazgg: we just need some circus music in the background during the screen resizing

01:18:23
tommyjmarshall: you put it in the page and componenet

01:18:26
oskrm: no need for js i think

01:18:28
elicxlive: Server actions are essentially calling a function that run on the server, from the client.

01:18:30
tommyjmarshall: just throw `use server`

01:18:34
tommyjmarshall: in the function

01:18:34
<transcript>: So does it work? It actually works without JavaScript.

01:18:35
lotuspixiee: it's just a function that runs on the server

01:18:49
<transcript>: I feel like that was a terror. That was just a lot of buildup.

01:18:49
<transcript>: for

01:18:50
samhuckaby: Is it like Astro's brainmatter stuff?

01:18:51
oskrm: rewatch?

01:18:53
<transcript>: For I don't understand why they recapped the other stuff.

01:18:53
<transcript>: did they

01:18:57
<transcript>: Did they do that yesterday? Did they recap versaille Storage yesterday.

01:18:59

01:19:00
gitpush_gitpaid: just came back. whats going on.. dax is in here and on his own stream?

01:19:10
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:19:12
elicxlive: The reason it was underwhelming is because we all already know most of it was happening 😂

01:19:15
trash_dev: idk why they made this day a big video

01:19:22
hugueshs: but why did they announce it like Guillermo was doing a keynote or something

01:19:26
c9_fuzz: they want us to bleed

01:19:27
<transcript>: Like if they just done this today, we could have been all those announcements all at once. Everybody could get excited about each of them. But we've already heard most of it. But then they did it in the middle. They sprinkled the new thing in the middle of all these recaps. It was so weird. I don't understand. They're so polished.

01:19:32
samhuckaby: Smoke and mirrors

01:19:36
<transcript>: What's that? Yeah. What's? So what's your guess what's that going to be.

01:19:43
samhuckaby: OCAML ON VERCEL!!!

01:19:50
dmmulroy: ^ lets gooo

gitpush_gitpaid: sounds like i didnt miss much

01:21:11
dmmulroy: they hyped today as the big one for sure

01:21:12
<transcript>: It was so big that it took up three minutes of their 20 minutes keynote. I don't know. Now I'm coming off again as a versaille, hater.

01:21:12
<transcript>: i don't

01:21:15
teej_dv: whoa, no no no. beyonce is the one that cured cancer

01:21:16
<transcript>: I don't hate her cell. This was just pretty underwhelming for me.

01:21:16
<transcript>: i don't

01:21:17
<transcript>: I don't.

01:21:21
<transcript>: I don't hate marcel. I think they're fine.

01:21:45
<transcript>: Adam loves Astro.

01:21:51
charafmrah: Vercel cured cancer

01:21:51
<transcript>: It's hard not to come off as a hater.

01:21:52
trash_dev: im fying up there soon. any message you want me to relay. "you hate vercel?" perhaps?

01:22:01
<transcript>: When you're in my position, I just feel like I have a lot of reasons to say the things I say that are not hate driven. Is that okay.

01:22:01
itsmeleague: He hates vercel because they don't wear 250 dollar shirts

01:22:05
smilingbig: KEKW

01:22:07
samhuckaby: @trash_dev make it sound angrier

01:22:07
teej_dv: @trash_dev please ask them when ocaml

01:22:08
<transcript>: Can I say these things that are critical, versailles, without hating them? Or is everyone's just going to think I hate them? Because I don't I don't hate them.

01:22:17
trash_dev: prime can ask that @teej_dv

01:22:18
fredkisss: one cool thing though, they revamped the nextjs docs

01:22:20
<transcript>: Okay. This has been fun. Normally, at the end of every stream, I say this has been fun. Maybe we could do it again sometime. I don't know. Was this fun? I don't know if it was fun. Maybe it wasn't.

01:22:20
<transcript>: maybe

01:22:23
pirazgg: could please say something so we can post without context?

01:22:24
