00:07:07
laytanl_: Y'all please stop me I'm looking at ocaml docs

00:08:39
matty_twoshoes: mathematically i should be at 0.04% higher chance now

00:09:38
cycling_7: The level of production of this stream is a,ways on steroids

00:09:38
tymekdev: That's definitely not how it works

00:10:58
matty_twoshoes: @TymekDev was that a response to me? You can claim it twice per stream, I've claimed 2 this stream and 2 last stream. So...... LUL

00:11:19
<transcript>: Let's go. Let's go. Joy dev. Thank you for the follow. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good afternoon. Who's here.

<transcript>: cosmic

00:11:33
<transcript>: Cosmic lasagna is here. Are we still working on the elixir rapper? Did Adam already resolve? Oh, I'll be working on the elixir app for the next two, three weeks.

00:11:36
<transcript>: That's what I'm doing right now.

00:11:40
<transcript>: And I've got a lot of incentive to get it done quickly.

00:11:45
<transcript>: I'm very excited to get it done.

00:11:45
<transcript>: i not super

00:11:49
<transcript>: I not super excited about some of the elixir pieces.

00:11:49
<transcript>: and

00:11:52
<transcript>: And feeling like functional programming.

00:12:01
tymekdev: @Matty_TwoShoes Yeah, but these are indepentent, so being picky it is still 0.01% for a win, but the chance that you should have won by now increases slightly. I don't remember the formula though

00:12:12
<transcript>: Is just to make you feel good. Sometimes not to be productive, but it's okay. We're getting there. Layton is here. Y'all please stop. I'm looking at O'camel, docs. O camel, the new hotness. I feel like tej started it. And next is just he's taking the torch and he's amplifying.

00:12:12
<transcript>: with his excellent

00:12:18
<transcript>: With his excellent Twitter skills, Maddie Tushu's is Here should be at zero 4%.

00:12:18
<transcript>: you should be

00:12:22
<transcript>: You should be at a .4% higher chance now.

00:12:22
<transcript>: is that how

00:12:26
<transcript>: Is that how statistics work? I don't know if you can increase your chances.

00:12:31
<transcript>: Cycling is here. The level of production on the stream is always on steroids. Yeah.

00:12:38
<transcript>: I have done a lot of work. I put a lot of time and effort and money into.

00:12:45
<transcript>: The stream production if I'm going to stream just like if I'm going to do anything else, I'm going to do it to the extreme.

00:12:50
<transcript>: Timec. That's definitely not how it works. Okay. I didn't think so.

00:12:55
laytanl_: Probability is hard

00:12:55
<transcript>: You can claim it twice per stream. I've claimed two times a stream and two times last stream.

00:13:01
<transcript>: I don't think they add up though I think it's always every single time is a one in 10,000 chance.

00:13:01
<transcript>: we did simulate it

00:13:14
<transcript>: We did simulate it yesterday because people were calling me, what are these things floating around? So people were calling me a scammer. Yesterday, we looked at the code. They were like, there's a bug. There's a bug in the code. They were just trolling me. It turned out, but we simulated the code.

00:13:14
<transcript>: we ran

00:13:16
<transcript>: We ran a simulation.

00:13:16
<transcript>: and

00:13:26
<transcript>: And it took about 5000 and something redeems for the simulation the robot to win the MacBook so it does happen.

00:13:26
<transcript>: just

00:13:28
<transcript>: Just hasn't happened yet.

<transcript>: Cycling thank you so much for the sub. You sub for three months at Tier one.

00:13:34
<transcript>: i

00:13:38
matty_twoshoes: @TymekDev I was being picky, since in the reward it doesn't specify whether redeeming it multiplies the chance or is additive ;) all good tough

00:13:41
<transcript>: I appreciate that so much. I appreciate that three times as much as a one month sub.

00:13:49
<transcript>: Who else is here? Egyle is here. Ao, ao, ao, aoa.

00:13:58

00:13:59
bodhihawken: i made it!

00:14:04

fossabot: @Matty_TwoShoes Matty_TwoShoes has been following adamdotdev for 8 months, 5 days and 20 hours

00:17:18
<transcript>: Stream three or four. Wow, that's awesome. Don't tell me you don't watch the show, you know, lifeless. I watched it. I think I watched the first two episodes. My wife actually was just saying how we got to watch it because people have been telling her.

00:17:18
<transcript>: she went

00:17:22
<transcript>: She went to a volleyball camp in Florida, and everyone's like, Oh.

00:17:22
<transcript>: the show on

00:17:24
<transcript>: The Show on Netflix.

00:17:30
fragaverage: July 14th @Matty_TwoShoes

00:17:33
<transcript>: So she's very curious now. So we're probably going to watch it at some point. But I watched the first couple of episodes, and it was like, yeah, it looks like the ozarks. Like river people.

00:17:35
<transcript>: Drugs.

00:17:35
<transcript>: i get

00:17:45
<transcript>: I get it. I get the idea. And I love Jason bateman. It was a little violent for me. Like, the first episode was like, I just don't watch stuff. I don't consume a lot of media.

00:17:45
<transcript>: so

00:17:46
<transcript>: So.

00:17:46
<transcript>: my poor

00:17:47
<transcript>: My poor.

00:17:47
<transcript>: de

00:17:51
<transcript>: Delicate brain has not been inundated with violent image.

00:17:51
<transcript>: in the way

00:17:57
<transcript>: In the way that that show just jumped out of the gate with people getting shot. It's like that's new. Okay.

00:18:08
<transcript>: I mean, I've watched some movies. It's just been a while. I remember watching savior. Private Ryan saving Private rhyme a long time ago. And that was hard. That was a lot of a lot of people getting shot.

00:18:08
<transcript>: i think

00:18:24
<transcript>: I think there's also just the gun thing here in the US, like, I already have nightmares about being at the grocery store and someone walking in, shooting it up. So maybe that's it. It's just like, hard to watch violent stuff when it's already in my nightmares. Okay. How did we get on this topic? Let's stop.

00:18:36
<transcript>: Let's stop. I got stuff to do. July 14. What is that? Frag. July 14. Maddie's been falling for eight months.

00:18:36
<transcript>: ki

00:18:40
<transcript>: Kiwis here. When was my first stream.

00:18:45

fragaverage: stream*

00:18:54
<transcript>: Sheeradoos. Thank you so much for a follow. Sheer. Dudes, man, it is getting harder and harder for me.

00:18:54
<transcript>: to

00:18:57
<transcript>: To prioritize my days.

00:19:02
<transcript>: Like what I want to do if it were just like, what would you do.

00:19:02
<transcript>: if you could

00:19:04
<transcript>: If you could do anything.

00:19:08
<transcript>: You have no obligations or no.

00:19:11
<transcript>: Reasons to do anything over the other.

00:19:16
<transcript>: I would stream that's all I would do? I really would.

00:19:16
<transcript>: and so

00:19:34
<transcript>: And so I end up doing it because it's what I want to do. But I don't know that it's always I think it's almost like snack food. Sometimes it's like I'm eating the junk food instead of doing I'm not eating my vegetables. I feel like I should be making YouTube videos because there's a whole world out there on YouTube that I just want to explore, and I want to learn and I want to grow on there, and I want to figure it out.

00:19:34
<transcript>: and

00:19:43
<transcript>: And feel like it could have a bigger reach, but just. It's so fun here on twitch. I don't know. This is just fun hanging out with you people. What is it.

00:19:46
<transcript>: How am I supposed to balance it.

00:19:48
fragaverage: Why is there @'s and Vs's? whats the difference?

00:19:54
<transcript>: Why is there ATS and verses? What's the difference.

00:19:56
fragaverage: I know nothing about american sports fyi

00:19:57
<transcript>: What's Apps and verses.

00:20:03
fragaverage: in the table

00:20:07
fragaverage: ohhh

00:20:17
<transcript>: Oh, verses means it was a home game. At means it was an away game. Did you guys hear that, holiver? Okay, nobody had any comments about what I just was just, like, pouring my heart out. And frank's, like, what's the deal with those at signs? I know nothing about American Sports in the table. Oh, no worries. Yeah, that's home game. So the Lakers were at home against.

00:20:23
<transcript>: The Raptors. And then Denver here was away at Detroit. That's the idea.

00:20:23
<transcript>: okay

00:20:24
matty_twoshoes: sports analytics ResidentSleeper

00:20:26
<transcript>: Okay. You guys are just here for the macbook. It's okay.

00:20:26
<transcript>: i'll stop

00:20:29
<transcript>: I'll stop pouring my heart out and I'll just start.

00:20:32
<transcript>: Working, I guess.

00:20:42
matty_twoshoes: i just REALLY don't like sports data

00:20:42
igalklebanov: Wilt meta was so imbalanced

00:20:42
<transcript>: Okay. So I started this very junk thing right here. We're going to let's style that thing a little better. Let's make it an anchor tag.

00:20:47
fragaverage: We're helping you prioritise by getting something done LUL

00:20:50
<transcript>: Wilt meta was so imbalanced.

00:20:52
<transcript>: That is.

00:20:52
<transcript>: so true

00:20:53
saura_e: No no, I loved what you said, I really feel you man.

00:20:56
<transcript>: So true and I love the way you phrase that.

00:21:00
<transcript>: Egyle. Do you play games where there's balanced metas.

00:21:09
<transcript>: You feel me, Sarah, welcome to Chat. Sarah. You feel me on the just don't know what I should spend my time on.

00:21:09
<transcript>: and then there

00:21:15
<transcript>: And then there's like five other things. It's like I want to build, rebase and work on that with dax, and.

00:21:26
<transcript>: I'm so excited about what I'm building for stabby's. Right now. There are literally like eight things that I would enjoy thoroughly to work on today. And I realized this is like First World problems. Okay.

00:21:30
<transcript>: I'm like suffering and success, or whatever the mean is.

00:21:30
<transcript>: i get it

00:21:32
<transcript>: I get it.

00:21:32
<transcript>: poor me

00:21:37
<transcript>: Poor me. I have like ten things that I would be super passionate and joyous about doing today.

00:21:37
<transcript>: but

00:21:44
daneoshiga: it's cool to remember initial Adam's streams of him learning vim and now he doesn't need to think about it too much

00:21:47
igalklebanov: I stopped playing online games years ago. I get too toxic. I'm too competitive and obsesive.

00:21:49
<transcript>: But that's also hard. It's hard to pick, okay? I don't know what to tell you. It's hard. And also, I don't have to work. I could just hang out all day. I've made my money.

00:21:53
<transcript>: But that doesn't make it any easier.

00:21:53
<transcript>: i mean i don't want

00:21:58
saura_e: is too difficult, what I think is super hard to decide vs  your potential options vs the possible options and everything

00:21:59
<transcript>: I mean, I don't want to not work. That's what my WiFi says. I would always talk about.

00:21:59
<transcript>: retiring

00:22:07
<transcript>: Retiring at 35 or whatever. How could I make sure that we're set up to retire early? And she's always like, Why, what are you going to do.

00:22:07
<transcript>: when you

00:22:07
saura_e: too much potential

00:22:09
<transcript>: When you retire.

00:22:09
cosmiclasagna: @igalklebanov This sounds too much like myself im scared

00:22:11
<transcript>: And she was so right.

00:22:15
<transcript>: I could not work for years. And we'd be fine.

00:22:23
<transcript>: But I would go crazy if I weren't working. And I don't know. Maybe that sounds like hustle culture. I don't want it to sound like hustle culture.

00:22:23
<transcript>: okay anyway

00:22:27
<transcript>: Okay. Anyway, now you guys are talking. Here we go.

00:22:27
<transcript>: egal

00:22:31
<transcript>: Egal I love the way you phrase that wilt mateo is so imbalanced.

00:22:31
<transcript>: i just really

00:22:34
<transcript>: I just really don't like sports data.

00:22:36
<transcript>: Funny.

00:22:36
<transcript>: we're

00:22:41
<transcript>: We're helping you prioritize by getting something done. That's true. You guys were quiet. You gave me time to think.

00:22:41
<transcript>: and

00:22:52
<transcript>: And work. But I didn't. I just kept poking you guys. It's cool to remember initial Adam streams on him learning them. And now he doesn't need to think about it too much. Yeah. De neo we did discuss yesterday. How.

00:22:52
<transcript>: i'm not

00:22:57
<transcript>: I'm not a very efficient vimmer. I'm still pretty inefficient.

00:22:57
<transcript>: but

00:22:59
<transcript>: But we'll get there.

00:22:59
<transcript>: we'll get

00:23:05
<transcript>: We'll get there. It's mostly the horizontal and vertical navigation. I just kind of like jj. J. J.

00:23:07
<transcript>: That kind of thing.

00:23:25
<transcript>: Stop playing online games years ago got to get too toxic? I'm too competitive and obsessive me too egal I'm too obsessive Sara is too difficult. What I think is super hard is to decide versus your potential options versus the possible options and everything. Yeah, there's too much potential.

00:23:33
<transcript>: It's the whole opportunity cost thing, feeling like you need to figure out the most efficient use of your time. It's also hard.

00:23:33
<transcript>: this sounds too much

00:23:34
matty_twoshoes: Decision Paralysis is a real thing

00:23:39
<transcript>: This sounds too much like me myself. I'm scared. Yeah. Cosmic. Okay, so we should start a support club for former.

00:23:39
<transcript>: former

00:23:40
matty_twoshoes: that's why i just DO

00:23:44
<transcript>: Former gaming addicts who can no longer play games because we get too addicted.

00:23:53
<transcript>: Decision paralysis. A real thing. That's why I just do. Yeah. And I end up just doing like I spend most of my time each day doing.

00:23:53
<transcript>: but

00:23:56
<transcript>: But there's like this moment every morning, where it's like.

00:24:05
bodhihawken: omg i do that with gaming

00:24:10
fragaverage: Yeah you played like 4 games of Among Us and suddenly it was "I REALLY WANNA PLAY AMONGUS TODAY"

00:24:11
bodhihawken: then i feel crap 3 hours later

00:24:16
techsavvytravvy: üëãüèª

00:24:17
<transcript>: There are like five different ways I could take this day, and I just don't know which one I want to do most, or which one's most important. I think it's the most important thing. I think I end up doing what I want to do the most, which maybe is good. I end up doing what I want to do right now that's work on status and stream. But maybe sometimes there's things I should do. And it's like I'm procrastinating.

00:24:17
<transcript>: or

00:24:19
daneoshiga: @FragAverage yesterday he was worried that he couldn't catch up to chat.. so tough streamer

00:24:21
<transcript>: Or I'm just like, that sounds hard. Maybe I don't want to do that today.

00:24:21
<transcript>: tra

00:24:23
<transcript>: Travis here.

00:24:34
<transcript>: You do that with gaming buddy, and you feel like crap. You guys later. Yeah. Okay. So a lot of us sounds like our recovering gaming addicts. It was bad for me. I filled out a College.

00:24:42
<transcript>: It was bad. I mean, I spent an entire semester just playing video games in my dorm room. And I was.

00:24:42
<transcript>: paying to be

00:24:43
igalklebanov: Dude me too, I dropped out once

00:24:47
<transcript>: Paying to be there and go to classes or pay for classes. I didn't go to.

00:24:48
techsavvytravvy: same

00:24:50

00:25:22
<transcript>: Yeah. You played like four games of among us. And suddenly it was. I really want to play among us. Yeah, I got over it because no one would play with me. It's a game that requires coordination. So that's good. I can't really get addicted to something if people won't play with me.

00:25:30
bodhihawken: tho my problem is now i wanna work and i cant play games!

00:25:33

igalklebanov: My GF is OK with me playing

00:25:58
<transcript>: Stop. So I don't think it took my kids coming, but yeah, I couldn't imagine with them around sitting around playing games all day. There's just too much to do. My wife would hate me every second I were spending playing games. She would just despise me. She'd want to punch me in the face. And I wouldn't blame her because.

00:26:02
igalklebanov: I play single player games once in a while

00:26:18
<transcript>: Her life is not playing games, though my problem is now I want to work and I can't play games. I spent like 16,000 failing out of College playing games. Yeah. Same trap. Same. We have the same story. I mean, I don't know the exact math, but I definitely burned an entire semester and ultimately I burnt the three semesters I was there because I didn't finish because of video games.

00:26:18
<transcript>: so yeah probably something

00:26:29
<transcript>: So. Yeah, probably something like that. 16,000. I don't know. Literally no time. You're wasting the productive time before us crowd wakes up. I know. Lame. I should get on it. I should get to it. Finally did it. But 80k too late.

00:26:39
<transcript>: Okay. My girlfriend's okay with me playing. I play single player games once in a while. Yeah, there's probably games I could play that I don't get addicted to but.

00:26:46
<transcript>: Kind of dangerous to find out. Okay, upgrade to pro.

00:26:53
vapor__dev: What game were u most addicted to v

techsavvytravvy: @vapor__dev WoW

00:27:10
<transcript>: A.

<transcript>: Oh, is there like a way to do gradient stops? Tailwind gradient.

00:27:15
<transcript>: stop

00:27:17
<transcript>: Stops.

00:27:19
saura_e: yes

00:27:23

00:29:05
<transcript>: Well, I guess back in the College days, when I failed out of College, it would have been playing like.

00:29:05
<transcript>: jeez

00:29:18
fragaverage: We were definitely playing at the same time. BC, LK

00:29:21
<transcript>: Jeez Burning crusade or something. It was like super early, but it was a lot of rating and then I think the last I played was wrath of the lich King. Like 25 hard Mode lich King with my last raid. Did you figure out what was that.

thdxr: there's definitely not a bug in that code

00:30:38
<transcript>: 80. I don't know.

00:30:40
<transcript>: Too transparent.

00:30:44
<transcript>: Look at this. Look how good this is going to look.

00:30:44
<transcript>: look how

00:30:48
<transcript>: Look how good I am at styling. No, it looks awful.

00:30:48
<transcript>: so

00:30:52
<transcript>: So it needs to be more white. Just the edges.

00:30:52
<transcript>: need to be

00:30:56
<transcript>: Need to be let's see, how do I change the stop.

00:31:01
<transcript>: We'll say via white, so solid in the middle.

00:31:05
<transcript>: One thing I could do that's better.

00:31:18
<transcript>: Das DJ welcome to Chat. Have you ever tried linux as your main OS? No, I have tried linux. I've just started playing with it in the last month or so.

00:31:18
<transcript>: even

00:31:19
<transcript>: Even.

00:31:25
<transcript>: Last month or so I installed arch on.

00:31:26
<transcript>: A.

00:31:29
<transcript>: Top eight, that's dumb.

00:31:31
<transcript>: Installed arch.

00:31:31
<transcript>: on

00:31:43
<transcript>: On Assistant 76 laptop and just played with it a bit, but not as my main machine. I'm waiting for a dax to work out all the kinks. He says his audio on a stream is pristine.

00:31:47
<transcript>: But I think you use it flawless.

00:31:47
<transcript>: we all know

00:31:49
vimcerf: !macbook

00:31:57
thdxr: ugh that one Spotify stuttering issue

00:32:01
<transcript>: We all know that's not true. So once he sorts out all the kinks, I might move to Linux, and I also just want to use my Mac studio like, I don't know if I can't run on my amazing Mac studio and take advantage of that hardware. I probably won't switch to Linux.

00:32:01
<transcript>: that one

00:32:06
<transcript>: That one Spotify settering issue. Yeah, that's the issue. Dax.

00:32:07

<transcript>: from

00:32:34
dasdjschaflp: @fragaverage there is an arch fork

00:32:34
<transcript>: From 10%, I kind of feel like.

00:32:34
<transcript>: i'm

00:32:36
<transcript>: I'm.

00:32:43

soeren_______: but not sure if external monitors are working yet

00:32:50
dasdjschaflp: @soeren_______ exactly SeemsGood

00:32:55
fragaverage: Oh cool

00:32:57
<transcript>: I kind of feel like I'm stalling on doing the hard stripe stuff that I should just do. It's not hard, just like the stripe stuff that I should be working on. Like I'm stalling maybe. And working on this stuff. That's not that important.

00:33:02
<transcript>: I also feel like I'm stalling and not doing a YouTube video when I just should.

00:33:18
<transcript>: It didn't happen yesterday. That's good. Is there a distro for M one, M Two chips, Sahi or whatever? Yeah. Sahi. Lennox. There it is. I'm on the new Mac Mini M Two Pro now, and it's wild. The new Mac Mini M two. Oh, I've heard, maddie. I heard that's. A great machine.

00:33:18
<transcript>: and like cost to

00:33:21
<transcript>: And like cost to power is nuts.

00:33:31
<transcript>: But not sure if external monitors are working yet. Well, I'm going to need Well, I guess I don't really. I use a teleprompter. So I do use an extra monitor. Yeah.

00:33:34
matty_twoshoes: 2K for this thing yeah, it's absolutely bonkers

00:33:41
<transcript>: Anna, thank you for that. Follow. I appreciate that it's early. 630. This is my international crew.

00:33:41
<transcript>: two k

00:33:44
<transcript>: Two K for this thing. It's absolutely bonkers. Yeah.

00:33:44
<transcript>: i've heard

00:33:48
<transcript>: I've heard it's a really great machine. I can't remember who all the MK.

00:33:48
<transcript>: mkhd

00:33:55
<transcript>: Mkhdb. Or whatever. Did he say? Mk? I don't know. Yeah. A video about it.

00:33:55
<transcript>: what was

00:34:00
<transcript>: What was I going to do? I was going to figure out why this doesn't work. I feel like this is supposed to be in brackets.

00:34:03
<transcript>: No.

00:34:06
<transcript>: Then why is that not working.

00:34:11
thdxr: Adam did you know I used to beat up mkhd in ultimate frisbee in HS

00:34:14
<transcript>: Yeah, should still be 50%, but I think that's probably the default right. Does feel weird with the percent sign in there.

00:34:21
<transcript>: I mean the docks. That's what the docs say. What am I missing.

00:34:28
thdxr: we used to guard each other and he was skinnier than me so I'd body the f out of him

00:34:30
<transcript>: What am I missing here? Don't add too transparent explicitly. What? Oh, they fade out to transparent by default.

00:34:32
dasdjschaflp: I have been on Arch for 6 months with Wayland and Pipewire and have less issues than with Ubuntu or WSL. Haven't tried osx though

00:34:35
<transcript>: Oh okay, so don't do too transparent.

00:34:35
<transcript>: okay

00:34:36
<transcript>: Okay.

00:34:36
<transcript>: you got

00:34:38
<transcript>: You got it.

00:34:41
<transcript>: Does that mean I don't need to do from either.

00:34:43
thdxr: and now he's a pro ultimate player and insanely successful

00:34:45
<transcript>: So need to do from.

00:34:45
<transcript>: transfer it

00:34:47
<transcript>: Transfer it.

00:34:51
<transcript>: So no too transparent.

00:34:56
<transcript>: That's looking better.

00:34:56
<transcript>: it's not doing

00:35:01
<transcript>: It's not doing the from and the two though the the 90 and the 10%.

00:35:07
<transcript>: Adam. Did you know I used to beat up.

00:35:07
<transcript>: mkh

00:35:09
dasdjschaflp: @thdxr for real? :D

00:35:11
<transcript>: Mkhd and ultimate frisbee in high school? Are you kidding me.

00:35:11
<transcript>: we used

00:35:23
thdxr: yes

00:35:28
<transcript>: We used to guard each other, and he was skinnier than me. So I'd body the F out of you. Are you kidding me? I've been on arch for six months with whalen and pipewire and have less issues than with ubuntu or wsl. Haven't tried Osxo. Now he's a Pro Ultimate player and insanely successful. Wait, what.

00:35:38
<transcript>: The same guy that makes the tech videos. Mkhd is a Pro Ultimate Player. Are you kidding me? I didn't know he was a Pro Ultimate player.

00:35:39
dasdjschaflp: @thdxr is he nice?

00:35:41
thdxr: mkbhd yeah

00:35:43
<transcript>: How did I not know this.

00:35:44
thdxr: he's super nice

00:35:49
<transcript>: Mkbhd. He does seem like he'd be super nice. Yeah.

00:35:53
<transcript>: So why is this not working.

00:35:58
thdxr: his HS would always win nationals they were really good

00:36:00
<transcript>: Can someone decide? I wonder if this is like an old version of Tail End or something? Wonder what our version is.

00:36:04
soeren_______: yes he is

00:36:06
<transcript>: I wonder, I wonder, I wonder inspect.

00:36:11
<transcript>: So let's see.

00:36:16
<transcript>: Via. Okay. So the from thing not working.

00:36:21
thdxr: we played on a regional team together one year

00:36:22
<transcript>: Like the the percentages the gradient stop percentages not working. Okay, cool.

00:36:22
<transcript>: well

00:36:25
<transcript>: Well, we can work with that.

00:36:28
<transcript>: Is it introduced in a certain version.

00:36:30
dasdjschaflp: @thdxr he is tall af, right?

00:36:35
<transcript>: For more control over the position. Our gradient stop color position. Combined the from via and two.

00:36:42
<transcript>: I wonder what version that's available in. Let's see what version we're using. How about that.

00:36:43
thdxr: not that tall

00:36:46
<transcript>: Tailwind? Css.

00:36:46
thdxr: quick

00:36:55
<transcript>: Package lock, 30, seven. Just go ahead and upgrade that. Dude, what do you say.

00:36:55
<transcript>: this is

00:37:00
<transcript>: This is three, three, one. Wow. Yeah. Let's upgrade. I don't know why we shouldn't.

00:37:00
<transcript>: right

00:37:02
<transcript>: Right.

00:37:06
<transcript>: Let's see, where is that package json right here.

00:37:14
<transcript>: Let's do three, three, one in here. Tailwind.

00:37:19
<transcript>: Two, three.

00:37:21
<transcript>: One.

00:37:27
<transcript>: Three, one. Is that what said yes? Okay. Cool. Now, I'll just do.

<transcript>: What am I doing.

00:37:58
<transcript>: He's Paul We played on a regional team together one year.

00:38:15
<transcript>: Is it pmpm? Whoa, no, that's not it. No.

<transcript>: That'd just be Mpm, right? Mpm install.

00:38:29
<transcript>: Next is here. How's it going? Next? Hey, next. Why don't you blue pill me on o'camel? What should I use it for.

00:38:32
techsavvytravvy: oh hey @nexxeln

00:38:35
<transcript>: Like I'm enjoying.

00:38:38
nexxeln: hi trav

00:38:40
<transcript>: The functional program. Let's assume theoretically that I'm enjoying.

00:38:43
nexxeln: ocaml for everything

00:38:46
vimcerf: hi nex!

00:38:47
<transcript>: My functional programming time right now not sure that I am, but let's assume that I am.

00:38:47
<transcript>: in

00:38:48
nexxeln: but its really nice for compilers

00:38:54
<transcript>: In that scenario, what would I use? Okamo. For web projects? Other.

00:38:56
<transcript>: Okay. Well, for everything.

00:38:56
<transcript>: but

00:39:02
<transcript>: But it's really nice for compilers. Compiler. Like writing a custom compiler.

00:39:02
<transcript>: what

00:39:03
lazic88: Just compiler design

00:39:05
<transcript>: What? I don't even know how to do that.

00:39:05
<transcript>: like

00:39:07
<transcript>: Like your own language.

00:39:07
<transcript>: oh

00:39:12
lazic88: That's pretty much it. Standard lib is very very poor

00:39:16
<transcript>: Oh, you mean compilers like compile typescript to javascript and that's not compiling, is it.

00:39:19
<transcript>: Standardlib is very, very poor.

00:39:19
<transcript>: compiler

00:39:21
<transcript>: Compiler design. Interesting.

00:39:21
<transcript>: okay

00:39:23
<transcript>: Okay.

00:39:24
<transcript>: Lazix here.

00:39:25
pbertrand_dev: the C in ocaml is pronounced like the C in chart btw

00:39:26
thdxr: you used f# right

00:39:29
thdxr: basically the same

00:39:33
<transcript>: The why is this still not working? Someone tell me why this isn't working. Do I need to rest? I bet I need to restart.

00:39:38
<transcript>: Anybody know Republic Tigers The song is amazing.

00:39:42
lazic88: Hi. Yes. Rust's compiler was initially written in OCaml

00:39:44
<transcript>: Yeah. I've used F sharp. Quite a bit, actually. So it's the same as F sharp. Cool. Okay.

00:39:44
<transcript>: i do love

00:39:52
<transcript>: I do love F sharp. I mean, I I don't use it a ton these days. I haven't worked on gamma, which is our service that uses F sharp in a while.

00:39:54
<transcript>: But.

00:39:54
<transcript>: is good

00:39:56
<transcript>: Is good do, enjoy.

00:39:58
nexxeln: you could do anything compiler like

00:40:01
<transcript>: Okay. Refresh this. Let's go. Come on.

00:40:05
<transcript>: Why do you hate me.

00:40:05
<transcript>: why

00:40:06
<transcript>: Why.

00:40:09
<transcript>: Oh, is it because wait.

00:40:11
soeren_______: transpiling

00:40:12
nexxeln: like languages, transpilers etc

00:40:14
<transcript>: No. Because it wasn't even showing up. Let's see. Here.

00:40:14
<transcript>: it wasn't even showing

00:40:17
<transcript>: It wasn't even showing that those yeah, 290 now is working.

00:40:23
<transcript>: It's just so via 50 I bet that's default.

00:40:28
nexxeln: its also really easy to parse stuff in ocaml

00:40:31
<transcript>: Is it from Tin Working? Yeah, from Ten. So I wonder if it's because there's only content in the middle? Does there need to be like.

00:40:31
<transcript>: how

00:40:33
<transcript>: How's this work.

00:40:36
thdxr: I wish rescript wasn't so react focused

00:40:39
<transcript>: Is it because there's only content in the middle? What do we think.

00:40:41
lazic88: @nexxeln Static analysis tools... FB has one for JS

00:40:48
<transcript>: Got any css experts in here.

00:40:48
<transcript>: fiendski

00:40:50
<transcript>: Fiendski. Thank you for that. Follow.

00:40:51
thdxr: and it worked with TS types

00:40:52
nexxeln: yepp! type checkers etc

00:40:54
<transcript>: You could do anything compiler like.

00:41:00
<transcript>: Hi, yes, russ compiler was initially written in O'camel. Really.

00:41:03
<transcript>: Wild just learned that.

00:41:06
<transcript>: The C and O camel is pronounced like the C.

00:41:06
<transcript>: and chart

00:41:08
<transcript>: And Chart By the way.

00:41:10
<transcript>: Sharp.

00:41:10
<transcript>: what

00:41:11
joshnerd557: Hey üëã Do you still use Yabai?

00:41:11
lazic88: It's insane injustice that ML languages are so underrated

00:41:12
<transcript>: What.

00:41:14
thdxr: someone build an ocaml to go compiler please

00:41:16
<transcript>: It's not O, camel, it's O channeled.

00:41:16
<transcript>: och

00:41:19
<transcript>: Ochamo no.

00:41:19
<transcript>: really

00:41:19
pbertrand_dev: ochaml

00:41:20
<transcript>: Really.

00:41:20
<transcript>: hi peebert

00:41:22
pbertrand_dev: yep

00:41:22
<transcript>: Hi Peebert chand, how are you doing.

00:41:23
pbertrand_dev: correct

00:41:23
nexxeln: fr @lazic88

00:41:25
thdxr: I need someone to build a compile to go language

00:41:30
<transcript>: Transpiling. Thank you, sore. And that's the word for what typescript is doing like languages.

00:41:31
noobdevshed: love your streamlayout is that obs/streamelements or streamlabs

00:41:50
<transcript>: Trans fathers, et cetera. It's also really easy to parse stuff in O'camel. I wish rescript wasn't so react focused. What is rescript? Stack analysis tools. Facebook has one for js and it worked with typescript. Types. Yep. Type checkers, et cetera. Hey, do you still use ubi? I do. Josh nerd. I still do use you buy although I disable it most times I use it on some screens.

00:41:50
<transcript>: but

00:41:57
<transcript>: But like this one, I don't because I manually lay it out because my stream is kind of specific now.

00:42:04
<transcript>: It's insane injustice that Mo languages are so underrated ml languages.

00:42:08
kiwifromearth: splendid

00:42:08
<transcript>: Ml Machine Learning languages.

00:42:14
<transcript>: Someone tell me what ml is. Someone build an O camel to Go compiler, please.

00:42:14
<transcript>: och

00:42:19
<transcript>: Ochamo. Really? Wait. Are you trolling me? I feel like you might be trolling me.

00:42:20
lazic88: OCaml, F#, ReasonML are ML languages

00:42:21
nexxeln: ML is a family of languages, "meta language"

00:42:25
thdxr: ML is a language, ocaml and f# are in that family

00:42:28
joshnerd557: Ah nice thinking of setting it up on my work laptop

00:42:30
<transcript>: Noob devshed. Welcome to Chat. Welcome to my Chat love. Your stream layout is at obs streamalements or streamlabs. It is obs.

00:42:32
<transcript>: And.

00:42:32
<transcript>: ob

00:42:35
<transcript>: Obs and.

00:42:35
<transcript>: just some

00:42:35
pbertrand_dev: Nope its pronounced Ochaml, ask anyone

00:42:39
<transcript>: Just some custom overlays that we wrote here on Stream, months and months ago.

00:42:50
<transcript>: So the item designed by a friend, David. He's a designer. He's excellent. He designed all the overlays, and I built them out in a next js. App.

00:42:50
<transcript>: and

00:42:56
<transcript>: And whatever thing my obs just points to browser sources. So that's what that is.

00:43:03
joshnerd557: Also F1 Statmuse üòâ

00:43:05
soeren_______: yabai doesnt work for me at all

00:43:07
noobdevshed: Beauty

00:43:10
soeren_______: not sure what i am doing wrong

00:43:17
<transcript>: Because I'm going to tell you if virtual is trolling me. Is it actually ochamo. Okay, I believe you. You sound like you're being serious. Ml is a language ocaml and F sharper in that family. Ml is a family of languages. Metal languages. Oh, interesting. I'm learning so much. Kiwi.

00:43:17
<transcript>: sple

00:43:18
<transcript>: Splendid.

00:43:21
nexxeln: i have never seen it being pronounced ochaml

00:43:24
<transcript>: Okaml F sharp reason ml are Ml languages interesting.

00:43:29
<transcript>: Thing setting up on your work laptop.

00:43:33
<transcript>: Also F one samus. There you go. Josh.

00:43:35
<transcript>: That's funny.

00:43:47
pbertrand_dev: @nexxeln ;)

00:43:48
<transcript>: You buy doesn't work for you at all. Soren. It's been like kind of weird for me lately. I feel like it's been buggy and I don't know if something in a Mac, if I did a Mac OS update and it became buggy, I know it was really hard to install.

00:43:54
<transcript>: Like installing you buy is not like installing just any old app. It was really annoying, right.

00:44:00
lazic88: @nexxeln He's trolling LUL

00:44:06
<transcript>: And I don't know. It might be conflicting with something since I've updated or something. I've never seen it being pronounced ochamo. Really? Next. Uhoh, he's strolling. Uhoh. Is he trolling.

00:44:06
<transcript>: you

00:44:10
nexxeln: oh sorry LUL

00:44:19
nexxeln: couldn't sense the troll in the chat

00:44:19
<transcript>: You guys, you guys with the wink. I believed you, bertrand. Now I know that you're just in the camp with dax and all the other trollers and anything you say is suss.

00:44:19
<transcript>: oh my goodness

00:44:21
joshnerd557: OCaml (/o äÀàk√¶m…ôl/ oh-KAM-…ôl

00:44:21
<transcript>: Oh, my goodness.

00:44:21
<transcript>: oh channel

00:44:23
<transcript>: Oh, channel, you sucker.

00:44:29
<transcript>: Thank you, Josh, for the official pronunciation.

00:44:29
<transcript>: i

00:44:29
kiwifromearth: how crass

00:44:32
<transcript>: I appreciate facts.

00:44:32
<transcript>: i'm very

00:44:36
nexxeln: adam just said "you sucker"

00:44:38
nexxeln: im here for it

00:44:39
<transcript>: I'm very fact based in this stream. Okay, so from 10% via, I'm just going to delete that because I just feel like that should not be necessary.

00:44:43
lazic88: For the love of god guys, a camel is OCaml's lol LUL

00:44:46
<transcript>: 290 percent. Now let's just try putting some more content in here and see if that helps. What if I just put like, a.

00:44:51
lesabotsy: What's up y'all

00:44:52
<transcript>: Background, though I feel like it's the background of this thing. Why would it not just do it the whole way.

00:44:52
<transcript>: let's try

00:44:57
<transcript>: Let's try changing this from 40%. Oh, wait.

00:45:00
<transcript>: No.

00:45:03
<transcript>: Wait. Do I want it to be.

00:45:03
<transcript>: bigger number

00:45:05
<transcript>: Bigger number, no.

00:45:05
<transcript>: oh wow

00:45:14
<transcript>: Oh, wow. Okay. So it did change it now. But why is it not all white in the middle? I'm doing from ten to 90%. That should be like.

00:45:17
<transcript>: Right if 50%.

00:45:19
<transcript>: Is.

00:45:19
<transcript>: white

00:45:21
<transcript>: White.

00:45:23
<transcript>: No. Oh, I'm doing this wrong.

00:45:25
<transcript>: I'm doing it wrong.

00:45:29
<transcript>: Do I just need one gradient, stop.

00:45:34
<transcript>: No, I need? Oh.

00:45:40
<transcript>: I need to go from transparent to a gradient stop that is white.

00:45:46
<transcript>: So it defaults to transparent. So if I do here we go.

00:45:52
<transcript>: I do two white. Why is this the hard thing I'm doing right now? From transparent.

00:45:54
<transcript>: If I did instead.

00:45:54
<transcript>: if i did

00:45:55
<transcript>: If I did.

00:45:59
<transcript>: From white.

00:45:59
<transcript>: via

00:46:01
<transcript>: Via white.

00:46:05
<transcript>: Or from white.

00:46:10
<transcript>: 20 or something via white.

00:46:17
<transcript>: Two. I'm so confused. Two. White.

00:46:23
<transcript>: And then from 10% to 90%, what does that do.

00:46:25
<transcript>: Why is this hard.

00:46:25
<transcript>: this

00:46:27
<transcript>: This is so hard.

00:46:27
<transcript>: i

00:46:30
<transcript>: I want it to be all the way up here? I want it to be.

00:46:33
<transcript>: I'm going from top to bottom, right.

00:46:36
<transcript>: What's up? Lesa.

00:46:39
<transcript>: A camel is O, camel.

00:46:39
<transcript>: camels a came

00:46:43
<transcript>: Camels. A camel is ocamls like logo or something.

00:46:47
<transcript>: I just said, you sucker, and you're here for it.

00:46:50
<transcript>: How crass.

00:47:07
<transcript>: Oh, did you think I said something else? Kiwi? I said, oh, sucker, you sucker. I didn't say something crass. Unless you think of suckers. Crass. Why can't I make this look like I wanted to make or like I wanted to look.

00:47:09
<transcript>: Do this.

00:47:09
<transcript>: just change it

00:47:10
<transcript>: Just change it.

00:47:10
<transcript>: is the amount

00:47:10
pbertrand_dev: @lazic88 dont you mean a Chamel is Ocaml's logo

00:47:13
<transcript>: Is the amount of content changed the gradient.

00:47:16
<transcript>: Would maybe if they were stacked.

00:47:23
<transcript>: What if I did a div.

00:47:24
thdxr: lol

00:47:29
<transcript>: With a class name.

00:47:33
<transcript>: Absolute inset. Zero. I don't know.

00:47:33
<transcript>: i'm just

00:47:36
<transcript>: I'm just trying to see what's going on with this gradient.

00:47:38
nexxeln: im writing a blog post on how ocaml type inference works

00:47:42
<transcript>: This sucks. Why is this hard.

00:47:43
nexxeln: is anybody interested in that

00:47:49
<transcript>: Don't you mean a channel is ocamel's logo.

00:47:57
thdxr: why isn't anyone using rescript

00:47:59
<transcript>: I'm writing a blog post on how ocam will type inference works. Is anybody interested in that? I mean, I don't even know enough about O'campill to know to have that question. I'm sure some people do.

00:48:03
<transcript>: Why isn't anyone using rescript? Well, first of all, what is.

00:48:03
<transcript>: grit

00:48:05
kiwifromearth: I don't appreciate trolliong Okay.

00:48:05
<transcript>: Grit.

00:48:10
thdxr: I need to look back into it, was kind of immature when I last tried

00:48:10
<transcript>: Someone tell me why I can't get a gradient that goes from.

00:48:12
pbertrand_dev: Teej will read anything Ocaml related you send to him

00:48:17
<transcript>: A little transparent on the edges to solid white to a little transparent on the edges. Why is that hard.

00:48:19
<transcript>: Tailwind.

00:48:23
<transcript>: Transparent.

00:48:23
<transcript>: to

00:48:26
<transcript>: To white. To transparent.

00:48:28
<transcript>: Gradient.

00:48:28
<transcript>: maybe i could

00:48:29
nexxeln: rescript is weird, but def the best frontend lang i've used

00:48:30
<transcript>: Maybe I could ask.

00:48:32
laame: you need the latest tailwind

00:48:32
<transcript>: Lgbt.

00:48:39
<transcript>: Let's Ask Share gbt New chat.

bishopdev: @adamdotdev why are u not asking chatgpt ? some boomer behavior

00:48:41
<transcript>: Here we go.

00:48:45
<transcript>: I need.

00:48:45
thdxr: the thing is I want to use it in the backend

00:48:47
<transcript>: A Div.

00:48:50
<transcript>: With tailwind.

00:48:50
<transcript>: css

00:48:50
nexxeln: but why

00:48:51
<transcript>: Css.

00:48:53
cosmiclasagna: would it work if you edit the height?

00:48:54
<transcript>: That.

00:48:54
<transcript>: has

00:48:56
<transcript>: Has a gradient.

00:49:02
<transcript>: A vertical gradient will say.

00:49:02
<transcript>: vertical

00:49:03
<transcript>: Vertical gradient.

00:49:04
thdxr: why not?

00:49:06
<transcript>: Where most of.

00:49:10
<transcript>: The middle is white.

00:49:12
nexxeln: why wouldn't you use ocaml then

00:49:15
<transcript>: With transparent edges on the top and bottom.

00:49:18
<transcript>: I don't know. Does that make sense.

00:49:18
<transcript>: but

00:49:25
nexxeln: or crablang or something

00:49:25
4836276578235: no

00:49:26
<transcript>: But why are you not asking to DPD some Boomer behavior? I am now Bishop, aren't I? I have a latest pale wind lame.

00:49:26
<transcript>: at least

00:49:27
thdxr: ecosystem

00:49:29
<transcript>: At least I just installed. Well, I think I did.

00:49:32
<transcript>: I think I did.

00:49:38
<transcript>: Yeah. Package. Json. Let's look at the package lock. Three, three, one. Yeah. I've got the latest.

00:49:40
nexxeln: f#?

00:49:40
<transcript>: Unless I'm missing something.

00:49:47
<transcript>: Postcss config. Yeah, no, I've got the latest.

00:49:50
<transcript>: What's this say to do.

00:49:54
thdxr: f# cold starts not great

00:49:58
<transcript>: The thing is I want to use it in the back end, but why would it work if you edit the height.

00:49:58
<transcript>: edit the

00:49:59
nexxeln: scala?

00:50:00
<transcript>: Edit the height.

00:50:00
<transcript>: of what

00:50:01
<transcript>: Of what.

00:50:04
thdxr: but they're going to get better soon I guess

00:50:05
<transcript>: Edit the height of what.

00:50:05
laame: @adamdotdev https://tailwindcss.com/docs/gradient-color-stops#specifying-stop-positions

<transcript>: Welcome to Chat, Four, Eight, 3627-657-8235. Is that your phone number? Welcome to chat.

00:50:19
4836276578235: thank you sir

00:50:23
<transcript>: Why wouldn't you use okamel then or crablang or something? Ecosystem is traveling rust.

00:50:25
nexxeln: btw does ocaml work in serverless

00:50:29
thdxr: it doesn't commit to any pattern, has everything in it

00:50:33
<transcript>: Shark cold starts. Not great. Yeah. Scala. I do think they're getting snap start for Net. Next. Dax. Does that change your calculus? Probably not.

00:50:34
nexxeln: https://crablang.org/

00:50:40
<transcript>: Gradient. Specifying stop positions. Yeah, we were just looking at those stocks. Lame.

00:50:40
<transcript>: doc

00:50:42
thdxr: yes ocaml is an almost perfect choice for serverless

00:50:45
<transcript>: Docs hates Scala by the way, does okama work in serverless.

00:50:52
thdxr: but the ecosystem is a bit tricky

00:50:52
<transcript>: Doesn't commit to any pattern, has everything in it. Yes. Oh, camel is an almost perfect choice for serverless. Really.

00:50:57
<transcript>: Question, what is this? Crabling.org.

00:50:57
<transcript>: who

00:51:00
<transcript>: Who made this? Did you make this.

00:51:00
<transcript>: next

00:51:02
<transcript>: Next. Did you make this.

00:51:10
<transcript>: Is it a community for it really is a community fork of a language named after a plant fungus.

00:51:10
nexxeln: no @techsavvytravvy did

00:51:12
soeren_______: dont say it

00:51:15
noobdevshed: LUL LUL

00:51:17
thdxr: I need to be able to use the AWS APIs without a bunch of jumping through hoops

00:51:18
<transcript>: Trav. You did it. You did this. That's a good idea.

00:51:22
<transcript>: Okay. Don't say it. Don't say the word. Rust.

00:51:24
nexxeln: star their github!

00:51:26
<transcript>: I need to be able to use the aws, a pads without a bunch of jumping through Hoops.

00:51:34
thdxr: the reality is the best (and worst) libraries are in JS

00:51:34
<transcript>: Starther github. What was it? How do I reopen a tab that I closed.

00:51:36
<transcript>: That's funny.

00:51:41
<transcript>: There it is. Github. Let's start it.

00:51:44
thdxr: so rescript on backend is interesting to me

00:51:45
<transcript>: Starred, you got it.

00:51:45
<transcript>: let's

00:51:45
4836276578235: cmd+shft+t

00:51:45
nexxeln: cmd + shift + t

00:51:47
<transcript>: Let's follow the Twitter.

00:51:47
<transcript>: follow

00:51:48
<transcript>: Followed.

00:51:48
<transcript>: cool

00:51:50
<transcript>: Cool.

00:51:50
<transcript>: okay

00:51:51
<transcript>: Okay.

00:51:54
<transcript>: Let's see what Chad gbt said.

00:52:02
<transcript>: Do I need to have an explicit height? Is that the problem? Background two T from transparent.

00:52:07
<transcript>: To top okay from transparent via white to transparent.

00:52:11
<transcript>: Okay.

00:52:20
<transcript>: I'm going to try adjusting the height. Like you said. Somebody said that fan shifty. Thank you, guys. I figured it out. Actually, I remembered.

00:52:23
<transcript>: Okay.

00:52:26
<transcript>: I've got like this crazy.

00:52:31
thdxr: ocaml also is a bit rough

00:52:36
<transcript>: Knot in my back, behind my shoulder blade. It's making it hard to sleep, and I don't know how to get rid of it. And I don't know what it's from. If I'm just like if my posture is terrible.

00:52:36
<transcript>: my

00:52:39
<transcript>: My posture is probably terrible.

00:52:43
<transcript>: So from transparent.

00:52:46
<transcript>: Like that.

00:52:50
<transcript>: Let's do to top, I guess just to see if it helps.

00:52:53
<transcript>: And they'll do via white.

00:52:55
<transcript>: To.

00:52:56
<transcript>: Transparent.

00:53:05
<transcript>: From 10% to 90%. I feel like that should if 10%. That means at 10% is transparent.

00:53:05
<transcript>: but

00:53:06
<transcript>: But.

00:53:06
<transcript>: the via

00:53:16
<transcript>: The Via the white is at 50%. I guess I want it to be solid white at 10%. Can I add more gradient stops? Do I just need to make this manually and not with tailwind.

00:53:19
<transcript>: Maybe I just need to do this without tailwind.

00:53:21
praskoo_: I usually try to create my gradient at cssgradient dot io before fucking around

00:53:23
<transcript>: Tailwind, tailwind.

00:53:23
<transcript>: gradient

00:53:25
<transcript>: Gradient.

00:53:29
<transcript>: More than two stops.

00:53:31
praskoo_: but I'm pretty sure it's doable with tailwind

00:53:31
thdxr: when I last looked at rescript it didn't have async await

00:53:33
<transcript>: I add it in arbitrary number of.

00:53:38
<transcript>: Oh, maybe I don't need via.

00:53:40
<transcript>: No, I do Yeah.

00:53:44
<transcript>: With multiple gradients.

00:53:47
pbertrand_dev: You cant have multiple stops,  I would create two divs and stack them vertically

00:53:51
pbertrand_dev: one has a gradient trans to white

00:53:53
pbertrand_dev: other white to trans

00:53:57
bishopdev: @adamdotdev I used to get that quite frequently, it's from our job, hands forward on keyboard/mouse. I visit a physio therapist once a week and it's been great, rarely have issues now with muscle cramps or soreness and I run 3k everyday

00:53:58
<transcript>: I'm wondering if I can do any number. Oh, I never checked the height. I didn't try doing that.

00:54:09
<transcript>: Prask, welcome to Chat. I usually try to create my gradient at Cssgradient IO before. Oh, that's an okay css Gradient IO.

00:54:09
<transcript>: okay

00:54:10
<transcript>: Okay.

00:54:10
<transcript>: you're for it

00:54:12
<transcript>: You're for it.

00:54:12
<transcript>: i need like

00:54:12
nexxeln: no it has async await now @thdxr

00:54:14
<transcript>: I need, like a little playground. That sounds perfect.

00:54:22
<transcript>: So this is what it would look like. I want it to be. How do I get rid of this? Okay. I want to be vertical.

00:54:25
<transcript>: I change it to be vertical.

00:54:26
nexxeln: https://rescript-lang.org/docs/manual/latest/async-await

00:54:29
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:54:34
<transcript>: Zero to 35. We're going to do.

00:54:36
<transcript>: Ten.

00:54:40
<transcript>: To 50 to 100.

00:54:40
<transcript>: no

00:54:42
<transcript>: No to 90.

00:54:47
thdxr: yeah I know

00:54:48
<transcript>: And we're going to make this.

00:54:50
<transcript>: White.

00:54:54
<transcript>: No, that one's going to be transparent, I guess.

00:54:56
<transcript>: That one's going to be white.

00:55:01
thdxr: I meant that's what stopped me last when considering it

00:55:01
<transcript>: This is transparent. How do I do clear.

00:55:05
<transcript>: Transparent. How do I do transferring it.

00:55:10
4836276578235: opacity

00:55:11
<transcript>: There we go.

00:55:15
<transcript>: And then this one also.

00:55:17
<transcript>: Zero Alpha.

00:55:17
<transcript>: so see

00:55:20
<transcript>: So see it's like right in the middle. That's not good. So.

00:55:20
<transcript>: the transparent

00:55:22
<transcript>: The transparent.

00:55:22
<transcript>: yeah

00:55:27
<transcript>: Yeah, I need these to be white. I need more color stops. Can I add more.

00:55:32
<transcript>: Or can you not in css? Is it just this.

00:55:36
<transcript>: You may know.

00:55:42
nexxeln: but i personally think we should try making ocaml happen not rescript

00:55:42
<transcript>: Pretty sure it's doable with tailwind. When I last looked at you guys are talking about O camel or something.

00:55:42
<transcript>: you can't have

00:55:47
<transcript>: You can't have multiple stops. I would create two divs and stack them vertically.

00:55:49
<transcript>: Oh, of course.

00:55:52
<transcript>: That's, of course.

00:55:58
<transcript>: Yes. So not one background. In fact, this won't have a background.

00:56:01
<transcript>: We'll just have two divs in here.

00:56:04
<transcript>: Class name.

00:56:08
<transcript>: Or actually I'll just do like.

00:56:11
feenskee: It kinda looks like you are using a controller to code üòÑ

00:56:11
<transcript>: One.

00:56:16
<transcript>: Okay. So let's say about this absolute inset zero.

00:56:23
<transcript>: Text, white flicks. Okay, so that's all good. And then just everything else is probably going to be gone.

00:56:23
<transcript>: okay

00:56:26
<transcript>: Okay. And then here we've got a div.

00:56:26
<transcript>: that

00:56:35
<transcript>: That's also absolute inset zero. And we're going to split it up in half. So we've got two divs that are half hide each right.

00:56:45
<transcript>: So like height 50 or one over two.

00:56:50
<transcript>: Height one over two.

00:56:54
<transcript>: And then. Oh, but if this is yeah. Not good. Right.

00:57:02
<transcript>: So through each half height and they're stacked on top each other background. Let's just test this.

00:57:06
<transcript>: Red.

00:57:10
<transcript>: Let's just test it.

00:57:13
<transcript>: Ha.

00:57:21
<transcript>: Yeah, that'll do it. Okay. So now we just go transparent to white, but we can do via, like, 10%. Yes.

00:57:24
<transcript>: Okay. Thank you so much.

00:57:24
<transcript>: pete bert

00:57:28
pbertrand_dev: exactly

00:57:35
4836276578235: genius

00:57:45
<transcript>: Pete bertrand, you redeemed yourself after that trolling. You came in with some solid advice. One has a gradient trans to white. Other white to trans. Exactly. Bishop. I used to get that quite frequently. It's from our job. Hands forward on keyboard mouth. Oh, I visited a physiotherapist once a week and it's been great. Rarely have issues now with muscle cramps or soreness. And I run three.

00:57:45
<transcript>: k every

00:57:59
<transcript>: K every day. So Bishop, is there a way that you can sit now with proper posture and you just don't develop the knot in the first place? Or do you have to keep getting it treated like you have to keep getting the knot fixed or you're able to prevent it. Now.

00:58:02
<transcript>: Opacity.

00:58:17
<transcript>: Okay, I personally think. Okay, you guys, I got to ignore dax. And next, basically ignore the moderators. Except for frag. Kind of looks like you are using a controller to code sceneski. Welcome to chat. Like I'm using a controller.

00:58:18
pbertrand_dev: mods WutFace

00:58:19
<transcript>: Really.

00:58:19
<transcript>: okay

00:58:23
<transcript>: Okay. So here's what we're going to do. We're going to say this one is.

00:58:26
<transcript>: Gradient.

00:58:28
<transcript>: To bottom.

00:58:29
dmdboi: Yo

00:58:32
<transcript>: And it's going to be from.

00:58:34
<transcript>: Parent.

00:58:34
dmdboi: obligatory redeem macbook

00:58:37
<transcript>: Two.

00:58:37
<transcript>: white

00:58:38
<transcript>: White.

00:58:38
bishopdev: @adamdotdev no .. that's just what we do, stretch and workout the muscles behind your shoulder plate. I used to get these cramps like a knot right behind the shoulder plate

00:58:40
<transcript>: Via.

00:58:42
<transcript>: White.

00:58:44
<transcript>: Right.

00:58:51
<transcript>: No, I don't need via. I just need to say the two.

00:58:53
<transcript>: Is like.

00:58:53
<transcript>: thirty percent

00:58:56
<transcript>: 30% or something.

00:58:56
<transcript>: right

00:58:57
<transcript>: Right.

00:59:00
<transcript>: And then this one.

00:59:05
<transcript>: Let's just do this. This one is going to be.

00:59:05
<transcript>: from

00:59:07
<transcript>: From white.

00:59:10
<transcript>: So white.

00:59:13
<transcript>: To transparent.

00:59:18
<transcript>: And the two is going to be like 70%. Is that how that works.

00:59:20
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:59:26
<transcript>: This is better.

00:59:26
<transcript>: this

00:59:28
<transcript>: This is better.

00:59:28
bishopdev: @adamdotdev I can link you a youtube vid with some nice stretches for that area: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CbUPfDyEtI

00:59:35
<transcript>: What's wrong though.

00:59:43
<transcript>: What is wrong? Oh, okay. So. No, it's not working.

00:59:47
<transcript>: So that second one is going from.

00:59:50
<transcript>: White.

00:59:53
<transcript>: Too transparent.

00:59:58
<transcript>: Oh, no, it should be two. Should be 30%, I guess.

01:00:00
<transcript>: All right.

01:00:00
<transcript>: no it

01:00:02
<transcript>: No, it should hit transparent.

01:00:04
<transcript>: Later.

01:00:10
<transcript>: Do I need a via.

01:00:10
<transcript>: do

01:00:12
<transcript>: Do I need a via.

01:00:20
<transcript>: Yo.

01:00:20
<transcript>: diamond

01:00:22
<transcript>: Diamond is here obligatory.

01:00:22
<transcript>: routine ma

01:00:34
<transcript>: Routine. Macbook. Totally fair. That's why it's there. That's just what we do. Stretch and work out the muscles behind your shoulder plate. I used to get these cramps like a knot right behind the shoulder plate. Okay. Yeah. A YouTube video. Thank you so much.

01:00:36
<transcript>: Bishop.

01:00:42
<transcript>: You're up there with me, pee bertrand on MVP of this stream.

01:00:47
<transcript>: Pull that up. Oh, it's playing. It's playing right now. Okay.

01:00:47
<transcript>: so what am

01:00:52
<transcript>: So what am I doing wrong here? So the first one looks pretty good.

01:00:54
<transcript>: I think.

01:01:01
<transcript>: Did I get the first one right. So it's background gradient to bottom from transparent.

01:01:01
<transcript>: to

01:01:04
4836276578235: hows trackpad compared to mouse for desktop work?

01:01:08
<transcript>: To white. And the two is at 30%, so it hits solid white. At 30%. The second one.

01:01:08
<transcript>: is background gradient

01:01:17
<transcript>: Is background gradient to bottom from white to transparent. The two is at 30%. No. The two should be at 70%.

01:01:24
<transcript>: Or I should do a via White via 70%.

01:01:24
<transcript>: is that what

01:01:26
<transcript>: Is that what I should do.

01:01:30
<transcript>: Let's try that.

01:01:30
<transcript>: from

01:01:32
<transcript>: From white.

01:01:34
<transcript>: Via white.

01:01:38
<transcript>: And then this should be.

01:01:40
<transcript>: Via.

01:01:40
<transcript>: thirty

01:01:42
<transcript>: 30%.

01:01:45
<transcript>: Right or 70%.

01:01:50
<transcript>: I don't know. I think so, but I feel like I'm guessing at this point.

01:01:50
<transcript>: nailed

01:01:50
pbertrand_dev: I think 70

01:01:54
<transcript>: Nailed it. We did it. Okay. This is what I was looking for. So then.

01:01:54
<transcript>: why is this

01:02:01
<transcript>: Why is this not showing up on top? Because these are absolute. Does that mean they render on top How's that work.

01:02:09
<transcript>: Or because this is flex Item Center.

01:02:12
<transcript>: That shouldn't be, I guess.

01:02:24
neugestaltet: z-index? no idea

01:02:24
<transcript>: So this should be let's just do this. Delete two there. And then let's put it right here.

01:02:27
<transcript>: Let's put the content.

01:02:27
neugestaltet: im noob

01:02:32
<transcript>: No, I guess then these would need to be wait, what.

01:02:35
<transcript>: I don't want to do that.

01:02:38
<transcript>: The Index. Maybe.

01:02:43
<transcript>: How's trackpad compared to mouse for desktop work. I like it. I do.

01:02:52
<transcript>: Feel like I'm missing anything and I like being able to just swipe between workspaces.

01:02:52
<transcript>: like on the same

01:03:01
<transcript>: Like on the same device. I don't know. Maybe you could do that on my mouse too. I don't know, but I like it. I think 70. Okay, so we got the background right now. I just don't know how to put the content in here the best way.

01:03:07
<transcript>: I don't want to flex this. This is just a background.

01:03:10
<transcript>: But.

01:03:10
<transcript>: why

01:03:11
<transcript>: Why.

01:03:15
<transcript>: This shouldn't have any fleck. No, it needs to. Because it needs to.

01:03:19
<transcript>: Oh, we have a separate Div now.

01:03:22
<transcript>: We have a separate Div.

01:03:26
<transcript>: This one is class name absolute.

01:03:26
<transcript>: ins

01:03:39
<transcript>: Inset. Zero. And it's flex. Can I just paste no flex items center. Justify center. Yeah. Okay. So this and then this is going to go up in there.

01:03:39
<transcript>: all right now

01:03:43
<transcript>: All right. Now we've got two absolute inset. Yeah.

01:03:47
<transcript>: Why is that not prettiering.

01:03:52
<transcript>: See what that looks like.

01:04:01
<transcript>: Upgrade Pro. All right, so we need to make that better looking. You should definitely upgrade Pro. Are you convinced.

01:04:09
<transcript>: Okay. I think even maybe more.

01:04:12
<transcript>: Up to the edges.

01:04:15
pbertrand_dev: how about

01:04:15
silverlp: i have to learn vim

01:04:16
<transcript>: I also wonder if I should do.

01:04:18
pbertrand_dev: <marquee>

01:04:21
<transcript>: Like little dashes in here. Or just leave them blank.

01:04:26
<transcript>: How about Marquis.

01:04:26
<transcript>: what's marquee going to be

01:04:31
<transcript>: What's marquee going to be used for you're saying like have the upgrade a Markey.

01:04:35
<transcript>: I have to learn vim Silver LP.

01:04:35
<transcript>: welcome

01:04:41
cosmiclasagna: gonna get some work done as well  while I have your stream at low volume here on the second monitor

01:04:43
pbertrand_dev: yeah have it scroll

01:04:47
cosmiclasagna: cheers

01:04:47
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Welcome, welcome. What does that 20 mean? Twitchcon 2020 in amsterdam. Do you live in amsterdam, Silver? Or you just live in Europe. Thank you for the follow. Silver.

01:04:55
<transcript>: Going to get some work done as well while I have your stream at low volume here on the second monitor. Sounds good, Cosnic. Enjoy.

01:04:58
<transcript>: Merchant. Yeah, have it Scroll.

01:05:02
silverlp: no i live in europe. 2020 was canceled due to covid tho

01:05:10
<transcript>: I can't tell if you're trolling again. I feel like bertrand you're back and forth between trolling. What would I have? Scroll this text. You live in Europe 2020 was canceled due to COVID, though. Oh, how'd you go? Was it virtual.

01:05:15
<transcript>: Oh, yeah? The the knot in my back. It's pretty serious.

01:05:19
silverlp: no just nothing ü§∑

01:05:31
silverlp: yep

01:05:33
pbertrand_dev: I live in Amsterdam

01:05:39
<transcript>: No, just nothing. Oh, like you bought the ticket, and then there just was no Twitch Con. So you got the badge, though. That's nice. I mean, you didn't have to go. Well, you probably wanted to go. Sorry, I'm the not normal person who doesn't want to ever go anywhere and see anybody.

01:05:39
<transcript>: bertrand

01:05:41
<transcript>: Bertrand Lives in Amsterdam.

01:05:41
<transcript>: although

01:05:48
<transcript>: Although bertrand everything he says, I have to have a side eye, a little bit of healthy suss.

01:05:48
<transcript>: because

01:05:50
silverlp: 21 was even closer to me but i couldnt go that year

01:05:52
<transcript>: Because he's been trolling, he's been helpful. But he's also been trolling.

01:05:52
<transcript>: once

01:06:05
<transcript>: Once you're a troller, you are forever labeled a troller. 21 was even closer to me, but I couldn't go that year. I'm going to try and go to twitchcon this year in the US. I know there's two twitch cons, but I'm going to go to the one in the US in Vegas.

01:06:05
<transcript>: actually

01:06:07
<transcript>: Actually going, are you going to Twitch.

01:06:07
<transcript>: con

01:06:08
kiwifromearth: I don't appreciate trolliong Okay.

01:06:09
<transcript>: Con.

01:06:11
<transcript>: That'd be cool.

01:06:18
<transcript>: You don't appreciate trolling? Okay. Okay. Kiwi, we got it. You don't appreciate it.

01:06:18
<transcript>: nobody's

01:06:24

grasum: just wanted to wish you a great weekend and send you some positive vibes.

01:06:26
thdxr: I'm worried twitch con is gonna be too weird

01:06:30
<transcript>: Now I'm just so aware of how I'm sitting and how my body is positioned. I just realized.

01:06:30
<transcript>: i didn't

01:06:31
<transcript>: I didn't.

01:06:32
silverlp: wait why do i see JSX files WutFace

01:06:35
<transcript>: Get this guy out.

01:06:43
<transcript>: Let's see. I'm worried twitchcon is going to be too weird. Why would it be too weird? Dax.

01:06:49
<transcript>: Grayson, just want to wish you a great weekend, send you some positive vibes. Thank you so much. Grayson.

01:06:49
<transcript>: wait

01:06:54
<transcript>: Wait. Why do I see jsx Files? Yeah, Silver, this is not even typescript.

01:06:56
thdxr: twitch is full of freaks!

01:06:56
<transcript>: This is original JavaScript.

01:06:58
<transcript>: Vanilla.

01:06:58
<transcript>: extra

01:07:00
<transcript>: Extra crispy.

01:07:00

01:07:08
fossabot: Adam's dotfiles live here: https://github.com/adamelmore/dotfiles

01:07:10
<transcript>: It's an eight year old code base. Twitch is full of freaks. Uhoh, are you saying, like the culture is going to be not our vibe. Dax probably a little less professional than reinvent.

01:07:21
<transcript>: But that's we'll get to meet, I don't know. Somebody will go, right? Actually, I'm just making assumptions that people are going, I don't know.

01:07:21
<transcript>: is like our prime

01:07:25
<transcript>: Is like our prime and trash. Well Trash said he might be going.

01:07:29
<transcript>: The seal. Go to twitch Con. I would imagine. Theo goes right.

01:07:31
<transcript>: For nothing else.

01:07:31
thdxr: I'll have fomo for sure if I don't go

01:07:35
<transcript>: Ping fails biz Dev.

01:07:36
silverlp: probably lol

01:07:37
thdxr: and you meet people

01:07:38
nexxeln: yeah theo went last year

01:07:41
<transcript>: Fomo for sure. But I'm going, yeah, we got to go to we got to go, dax, we're going right.

01:07:44
thdxr: ping pivoted!

01:07:51
<transcript>: Deal went last year. Yeah. As long as everybody's going and it's not like not this year. I don't want to go and not meet all our friends, but if ping pivoted. Yeah.

01:07:51
<transcript>: but

01:07:57
<transcript>: But they still do ping, right? They don't even do new sign ups. I'm still able to use it, right.

01:08:03
thdxr: it's in maintenance mode

01:08:05
<transcript>: Oh, am I not still able to use ping? I thought I was since they pivoted, but maybe not.

01:08:08
<transcript>: Maintenance mode.

01:08:09
<transcript>: Interesting.

01:08:09
<transcript>: i don't want to

01:08:10
thdxr: exited the creator space

01:08:12
<transcript>: I don't want to lose pain.

01:08:21
thdxr: ping is still there

01:08:22
<transcript>: Shoot exited the creator space buma. I really enjoy ping and I don't know what the alternative is. I guess guest mode on twitch is that.

01:08:31
<transcript>: An option. Okay. I got to get something done here. Let's see. So we have upgraded to pro. We're going to make that like 5%.

01:08:34
<transcript>: To.

01:08:40
<transcript>: What is it? Oh, 30%. Let's do 10%.

01:08:44
silverlp: JS looks funny after my 18 months of corporate fintech typescript (i hate it so much)

01:08:47
<transcript>: 90%.

01:08:50
<transcript>: Thing is still there.

01:08:56
<transcript>: Is it going to stay there? Js looks funny. After my 18 months of corporate fintech typescript, I hate it so much.

01:08:59
<transcript>: Yeah, javascript is funny.

01:09:02
<transcript>: And I don't love using it.

01:09:10
pbertrand_dev: corporate fintech typescript. sounds gross

01:09:11
<transcript>: But we're not going to move this code, but we're rewriting this entire app in astro. So we are using typescript in the reroute. Obviously.

01:09:14
levidayne: Riversidefm does most of ping‚Äôs stuff minus the obs integration I think?

01:09:15
<transcript>: But, yeah, this is an older code base.

01:09:15
<transcript>: corporate fint

01:09:17
silverlp: Astro lets go!

01:09:23
<transcript>: Corporate fintech typescript sounds gross. Riverside, FM does most of ping's stuff minus the obs integration. I think the obs integration is.

01:09:23
<transcript>: a very important part

01:09:29
<transcript>: A very important part of it for me. That's what I use Ping for. I don't even know what else you do with Ping.

01:09:33
<transcript>: I mean with riverside. Wait. So what does riverside do.

01:09:38
schrew: Gm!

01:09:40
<transcript>: I use it for podcast, stuff.

01:09:42
<transcript>: But good morning. Shrew.

01:09:44
<transcript>: Okay.

01:09:56
schrew: Riverside was the name of the high school that bottled the region championship in soccer my junior year

01:09:57
silverlp: Will you use some SSR or how do you plan the rewrite?

01:09:59
<transcript>: I need to style this. Do I want to style it right now, or do I just want to move on? I think I'm going to just move on to the hard stuff. We got to get the actual thing wired up. That's basically what it's going to be. It's going to be much better looking. I found some inspiration. We might go with something like this.

01:10:03
<transcript>: Where did it go.

01:10:03
<transcript>: where did

01:10:06
<transcript>: Where did it go? You kidding me.

01:10:08
4836276578235: lol

01:10:17
<transcript>: Can I not click on that now that I'm logged in, whatever. Let's search. How do I search? There we go. Upgrade to pro.

01:10:21
<transcript>: Upgrade Two pro.

01:10:27
<transcript>: So I might do something like this.

01:10:27
<transcript>: is how we're going

01:10:28
nexxeln: probably cause they have dynamic data @Schrew

01:10:32
<transcript>: Is how we're going to do the upgrade banner. Maybe. I don't know what you get. Yeah, this is pretty good.

01:10:35
<transcript>: Monthly Annual Get Real fantastic.

01:10:35
<transcript>: i'm going to

01:10:42
<transcript>: I'm going to have to put type your email address in there, too. We'll just put a bunch of player avatars in here.

01:10:49
nexxeln: meant to ping @SilverLP sorry

01:10:51
silverlp: oh is that THE t3 maintainer

01:10:52
silverlp: Pog

01:10:59
nexxeln: yes hello

01:10:59
<transcript>: Riverside was the name of the high school that bottled the region Championship in soccer my junior year. Really? Will you use some ssr or how do you plan the rewrite? We're mostly through the rewrite silver. And it is a lot of ssr. Yes.

01:10:59
<transcript>: we're going to be rel

01:11:07
<transcript>: We're going to be relying on cloud front is adding support for stalewire revalidate headers. We're very dependent on that.

01:11:07
<transcript>: to kind of

01:11:11
<transcript>: To kind of have like a next js ISR experience.

01:11:11
<transcript>: so that's

01:11:14
<transcript>: So that's not actually.

01:11:14
<transcript>: ssr

01:11:14
schrew: @nexxeln I think it was cause they benched their all star goalie because of "disciplinary issues" (he was caught smoking weed with some of our high school's players)

01:11:16
<transcript>: Ssr every time it's like.

01:11:16
<transcript>: we're caching

01:11:18
<transcript>: We're caching.

01:11:33
<transcript>: Aggressively is the word I'm looking for. I guess so. Nobody ever gets those real ssr because it does take a bit to actually generate a page because we rely on some services like our nlp service and all that stuff.

01:11:40
<transcript>: So yeah we're going to use do I revalidate to hopefully eliminate any really slow renders for people.

01:11:41
silverlp: oh yea im hoping for an ISR compatible astro adapter. solidstart has one already

01:11:42
nexxeln: astro ssr is pretty fast

01:11:43
<transcript>: But yeah, a lot of SSR.

01:11:43
<transcript>: is that

01:11:48
<transcript>: Is that the T Three maintainer? Yeah. Silver. Theo.

01:11:53
<transcript>: Probably because they have dynamic data. What would shrew's question? Oh, Riverside.

01:11:56
silverlp: it really is fast

01:11:59
<transcript>: Oh, you meant the ping Silver. Okay, I see.

01:12:09
<transcript>: Hoping for an isr compatible astro adapter Solid Start has one already.

01:12:12
<transcript>: For deploying Wear silver.

01:12:15
<transcript>: Like where.

01:12:15
<transcript>: can you deploy

01:12:17
<transcript>: Can you deploy solid start with ISR.

01:12:17
<transcript>: there's an

01:12:20
<transcript>: There's an adapter for.

01:12:23
silverlp: oh for deploying to vercel

01:12:23
<transcript>: Astro ssrs pretty fast. Yeah, no, astro ssr is great.

01:12:27
<transcript>: The problem is the downstream services.

01:12:27
<transcript>: we have a service

01:12:32
<transcript>: We have a service called gamma that does our natural language processing stuff. And it's not super fast.

01:12:43
<transcript>: Well, I mean, it's like not terrible slow. I mean, if we go to sammy's Dot, like if we ask a question, like, how many Home runs did Barry Bonds hit.

01:12:45
<transcript>: That was fast.

01:12:45
<transcript>: okay

01:12:50
<transcript>: Okay. So maybe it is fast. I don't know. I thought the service was a little slower.

01:12:50
<transcript>: how many did

01:12:51
4836276578235: lol Û†ÄÄ

01:12:53
levidayne: Has Cloudfront got the ISR headers now or yet to come?

01:12:55
nexxeln: LUL

01:12:56
<transcript>: How many did he hit on tuesdays? I don't know. Maybe that was a question that was in cash or something. No, it's pretty fast.

01:12:56
<transcript>: one hundred and

01:13:00
nexxeln: that was so fat

01:13:01
<transcript>: 121 times on Tuesday. So Maybe it's fine, it's fine. Who needs ISR.

01:13:01
<transcript>: i

01:13:05
<transcript>: I thought there were some of them that were really slow, but maybe not.

01:13:05
<transcript>: for

01:13:07
nexxeln: fast

01:13:07
<transcript>: For deploying to Versaille so.

01:13:07
<transcript>: what i'm talking about

01:13:08
nexxeln: *

01:13:10
thdxr: swr

01:13:13
silverlp: i wouldnt know many things that could do faster SSR than astro. solid and maybe svelte?

01:13:14
<transcript>: What I'm talking about is deploying astros straight to our own aws accounts. We're not going to be using for sale because.

01:13:14
<transcript>: it would cost order

01:13:16
<transcript>: It would cost orders of magnitude more.

01:13:16
<transcript>: to host sammy com

01:13:25
pbertrand_dev: Seems pretty fast -> https://www.statmuse.com/mlb/ask/how-many-runs-could-a-home-run-run-if-a-home-run-could-run-runs

01:13:29
<transcript>: To host Sammy.com on versailles. Yeah, it's super fast. It's so fast. I thought it was cash, but like, no way that someone asked this question right on tuesdays, against the mariners. This is definitely a unique question. And it was pretty quick.

01:13:29
<transcript>: no home

01:13:33
silverlp: oh yea such a large userbase makes a difference again for sure

01:13:37
<transcript>: No home runs on tuesdays against the mariners in his career. How about that? Here's the games he played against the mariners on tuesdays. Zero home runs.

01:13:39
<transcript>: Was that his weakness.

01:13:39
<transcript>: the mariner

01:13:43
<transcript>: The mariners on Tuesdays.

01:13:43
<transcript>: just kidding

01:13:47
<transcript>: Just kidding. So those are pretty fast. Okay. Cool. Sounds good.

01:13:47
<transcript>: i like it

01:13:50
nexxeln: LUL

01:13:57
<transcript>: I like it. Thank you for the follows 48362. I'm not going to say your name like that every time I'll just call you 48, I think for the fall of 48 and Will Baker.

01:14:01
<transcript>: Such a large user base makes a difference again, for sure. Yeah.

01:14:03
4836276578235: LUL

01:14:04
<transcript>: We got millions of users.

01:14:05
<transcript>: Millions.

01:14:05
<transcript>: i still can't believe

01:14:11
<transcript>: I still can't believe it didn't dawn on me that I built a startup that has millions of users, and I never talk about it.

01:14:14
<transcript>: I should be talking about it. So much.

01:14:26
4836276578235: should do a ted talk

01:14:26
<transcript>: I should be, like telling people they should listen to me or something, right? I should be throwing my weight around in the web Dev community, but I've just been sitting back like, I don't really have anything to add. I do have stuff to add. Okay.

01:14:26
<transcript>: i don't

01:14:33
<transcript>: I don't know. It does feel like just luck. Feels like we built something, and it stayed alive for nine years. So, of course, it has millions of users.

01:14:33
<transcript>: well not of course

01:14:35
<transcript>: Well, not of course, but.

01:14:35
<transcript>: it feels

01:14:45
<transcript>: It feels less like I was so good at something that we have millions of users. It's just more like, right place, right time, built the right thing, stayed alive long enough. Raise enough money. Did all that stuff.

01:14:45
<transcript>: anyway

01:14:47
<transcript>: Anyway.

01:14:52
<transcript>: Dirty Work? What a song, what a song.

01:14:54
<transcript>: Seems pretty fast.

01:14:54
<transcript>: how

01:14:56
<transcript>: How many runs could a Home run run.

01:15:01
thdxr: yeah all that sounds easy

01:15:06
<transcript>: Birch, engineer, says a troll I wouldn't know many things that could do fast dresses hard than astro solid and maybe svelte svelt.

01:15:11
<transcript>: Has cloudfront got the isr headers now are yet to come.

01:15:11
<transcript>: it's

01:15:16
<transcript>: It's coming. The swr headers are coming soon. Dax. When is it coming.

01:15:20
<transcript>: When is it coming? Do you know when.

01:15:23
<transcript>: Should do a Ted talk.

01:15:34
thdxr: supposed to be next week

01:15:34
<transcript>: Yeah. All that sounds easy. Oh, the stuff that I just glossed over. I mean, like, I guess I did help fundraise. I guess I was involved in all of that.

01:15:34
<transcript>: but

01:15:41
<transcript>: But I guess it doesn't feel like I don't feel like because I'm like some good programmer stat. Me says millions of users. You know what I'm saying.

01:15:41
<transcript>: i

01:15:44
<transcript>: I guess maybe that's why I haven't really.

01:15:44
<transcript>: thrown my weight around

01:15:47
<transcript>: Thrown my weight around is I don't feel like I know more than the next guy.

01:15:47
<transcript>: it's just

01:15:51
<transcript>: It's just like my side project took off.

01:15:51
<transcript>: but

01:15:54
<transcript>: But I guess I know stuff about startups.

01:15:54
<transcript>: i should

01:15:57
<transcript>: I should talk about making startups more.

01:16:02
thdxr: also it's funny you said SSR would be slow and everyone jumped to thinking about framework performance and not....the actual application

01:16:11
<transcript>: And like running them. But I don't feel like it was like my programming expertise. That got to this point where we get a million inbounds from Google every day. That wasn't because of my programming expertise. There's a lot of other factors.

01:16:17
thdxr: state of js rn everyone thinking in demo apps

01:16:18
fragaverage: Startup content would be gold

01:16:21
<transcript>: Supposed to be next week. Okay, good. Also, it's funny you said ssr would be slow and everyone jumped to thinking about Framework performance and not the actual application. Yeah, it's interesting.

01:16:27
<transcript>: Startup content would be gold. All right, I'll make some startup content.

01:16:27
<transcript>: i mean

01:16:32
<transcript>: I mean, I have thoughts about programming, too, but I do have less thoughts about programming problems. Probably.

01:16:42
<transcript>: Yeah, no. The app is slow. The framework is fine. I'm sure. I just assume they're all fine.

01:16:47
<transcript>: Okay.

01:16:50
pbertrand_dev: make a tailwind gradient tutorial

01:16:51
<transcript>: Upgrade to Pro. Let's build the hard stuff now.

01:16:54
<transcript>: Let's go on to bigger and better and harder things.

01:16:54
<transcript>: feel like that one

01:16:59
<transcript>: Feel like that one cuts off way. Oh, it's because the scroll bar is factored in.

01:17:01
<transcript>: So let's actually.

01:17:01
<transcript>: do like

01:17:04
<transcript>: Do like 80% on the bottom.

01:17:12
<transcript>: Okay, make a tailwind gradient tutorial bertrand that you're becoming one of my favorite people in chat.

01:17:18
<transcript>: The mixture of trolling humor and seriousness. It's nice.

01:17:23
<transcript>: Dax could only dream of being so funny. Trolley.

01:17:23
<transcript>: use

01:17:25

01:17:43
pbertrand_dev: mods are very busy people

01:17:46

01:17:59
<transcript>: mods are very

01:18:04
<transcript>: Mods are very busy people. It's true you should introduce him to your wife.

01:18:08
<transcript>: Wait. What.

01:18:12
<transcript>: Who should I introduce to my wife, Bishop.

01:18:16
<transcript>: Is this the meme where my wife doesn't like me.

01:18:17
bishopdev: @adamdotdev cause he's funny :D

01:18:22
silverlp: who needs a sword if you have a big 20 in front of your name CoolCat

01:18:22
<transcript>: My wife likes me so much because he's funny.

01:18:25
<transcript>: Oh, boy, you guys.

01:18:26
thdxr: Adam say what your wife said

01:18:30
<transcript>: Who needs a sword if you have a big 20 in front of your name. That's right.

01:18:32
<transcript>: Say what your rife said. I will never.

01:18:38
<transcript>: This isn't even thing I'll. Dm. You so this is not a thing I will ever share.

01:18:45
<transcript>: Maybe it never is. Maybe too strong. I definitely won't share it publicly. I might share it with you, dax, privately, but probably not.

01:18:45
<transcript>: it

01:18:47
thdxr: Adam whispers to himself "my wife likes me so much"

01:18:50
<transcript>: It wasn't one thing she said. It was a conversation. We had that.

01:18:50
<transcript>: the

01:18:51
thdxr: DM me plzzzz

01:18:52
<transcript>: The whole of the conversation.

01:18:57
<transcript>: Would totally exacerbate that meme to the.

01:19:01
thdxr: I need to know

01:19:03
<transcript>: Instigree kosaki kosaku. Thank you for the follow.

01:19:03
<transcript>: okay

01:19:12
<transcript>: Okay, so we need a stripe page. It's time to build stripe stripe integration. Time. You need to know. Dax, I'm sorry. I really can't. Not yet. I'm not prepared.

01:19:12
<transcript>: to have

01:19:16
<transcript>: To have this conversation because I don't know where it will go.

01:19:16
<transcript>: listen

01:19:18
<transcript>: Listen, we're just.

01:19:18
<transcript>: i can't

01:19:19
thdxr: if you don't tell me I'll make something up

01:19:20
<transcript>: I can't say anything.

01:19:26
<transcript>: oh boy

01:19:27
<transcript>: Oh boy.

01:19:33
pbertrand_dev: oh we flexing? I also have a wife

01:19:37
<transcript>: He'll make something up like I'm a scammer. Oh, no. What will I do if dax makes up that I'm a scammer and tells everybody every day.

01:19:41
fragaverage: you do NOT want to unlock Dax's imagination

01:19:41
<transcript>: Are we flexing? I also have a wife. That's funny.

01:19:45
<transcript>: I might dm. You. Dax, this is a conversation. We could probably have.

01:19:55
<transcript>: I don't know if I'm prepared for the questions that might ensue. I don't know. I don't know if I'm prepared for what you'll think of me or us.

01:19:55
<transcript>: i don't know

01:19:56
<transcript>: I don't know.

01:19:59
thdxr: Adams wife left him and Adam pretends she's still around

01:20:05
<transcript>: It was a conversation I did not expect to have. I'll say that adam's wife left him in and pretends she's over. It's not true.

01:20:05
<transcript>: no

01:20:14
thdxr: did she want an open relationship?

01:20:23
<transcript>: No, because if she left me, I'd just tell you and like, yeah, the meme was true. She really didn't like me. Turns out we all learned together. That's not what happened. You do not want to unlag unlock DIx's imagination. It's true. Does she want an open relationship? No. What is an open relationship? I don't know what that is.

igalklebanov: he's in the Ozarks, he might have killed her and she's in the trunk right now

01:20:37
<transcript>: Why are you laughing at me next? What's so funny? Should I know what an open relationship is? Is it like you see other people.

01:20:43
thdxr: it's a dumb thing people in their 20s think is cool

01:20:45
<transcript>: Is that like you kind of want to break or something? He's in the ozarks. He might have killed her. And she's in the trunk right now. Oh, my goodness. I gal.

01:20:45
<transcript>: listen

01:20:50
<transcript>: Listen, the show. It's just TV, okay? Things are not that dramatic.

01:20:53
bodhihawken: yeah you should probably know xD

01:20:54
<transcript>: It's a dumb thing. People in their 20s think is cool.

01:20:54
<transcript>: could you tell me

01:20:55
feenskee: open source relationship

01:20:59
<transcript>: Could you tell me what it is? I'm guessing open relationship means like you're open.

01:20:59
<transcript>: to

01:21:06
<transcript>: To multiple people in your relationship. I don't know. You should probably know. I should probably know. Open source relationship.

01:21:09
thdxr: yes

01:21:12
nexxeln: yeah

01:21:16
<transcript>: Like I can intuitively try to put together what that means. But I feel like I've never heard the definition. Yes, that's what it means. Okay. And people that are married do that.

01:21:19
<transcript>: This not in my back. I'm telling you.

01:21:19
igalklebanov: Are you telling me there are no hillbillies in the Ozarks?

01:21:23
nexxeln: yes

01:21:25
bodhihawken: @thdxr yes, open to spending time with other people. theres like a 100 different times XD

01:21:28
igalklebanov: and no cartel?

01:21:31
thdxr: Adams wife thinks he smells bad

01:21:39
<transcript>: Oh, are you telling me there are no Hillbase nails arcs. Oh, there were 100% our hillbillies in the ozark. Ozarks. In fact, growing up in willow Springs, the town I lived in.

jaythedeveloper: @thdxr i really like that sst.dev kinda "abuses" the codebuild for long running jobs

12:36:56
<transcript>: Stripe checkout. No code. Checkout pages. Wait. Yeah. What's payment links? Create a checkout page in a few clicks, sell product subscriptions or accept donations with a link. No code required. Is this better? Payment links are super simple.

12:36:59
<transcript>: Okay, is this better.

12:37:03

12:37:07
thdxr: @jaythedeveloper haha yeah funny trick

12:37:10
<transcript>: Add a new product.

12:37:12
bodhihawken: yeah keep it in one place, you generate it serverside and send the link back to the client side

12:37:19
silverlp: Maybe i should look more into SSTZ

12:37:20
<transcript>: Keep it in one place. You generate server side and send the link back to the.

12:37:20
<transcript>: client side

12:37:20
bodhihawken: another solution is to use the stripe pricing table

12:37:21
<transcript>: Client side.

12:37:29
<transcript>: What's the difference in payment links and checkout? How does it differ.

12:37:29
<transcript>: okay

12:37:47
<transcript>: Okay, I really have to pee. So I'm going to have to take a break to pee. Just a reminder to everybody that you can send me Twitter links. And in a little bit we'll get on Twitter and read tweets that are interesting. If there are none, we won't do it. But if you have tweets that were interesting, just paste them in my chat and we'll read them later. Okay. I'll be right back.

12:37:50
bodhihawken: Payment Links are a bit harder to link back to a guests account

12:38:02
dmdboi: Generating the checkout is easy, the hard part of handling webhooks

12:38:02

12:39:06
bodhihawken: with the checkout, you can just create a customer, add their user id from your system, and then when you get the webhook its easy to associate them. with the pricing table you just attach their user id to the html, and wait till you get webhooks!\

12:42:58
<transcript>: All right.

12:42:58
<transcript>: what

12:42:59
<transcript>: What's going on.

12:43:09
<transcript>: Generating checkouts. These are the hard part is handleing webhooks. Yeah exactly. Diamond payment leaks are a bit harder to link back to a guest's account.

12:43:12
<transcript>: Okay. Another solution is.

12:43:12
<transcript>: the stripe

12:43:12
bishopdev: @adamdotdev real streamers use a pee bottle

12:43:15
<transcript>: The stripe It's use a stripe Pricing table.

12:43:21
<transcript>: Given one place, you generate it serverside and send the link back to the client side. So I'm still struggling to understand.

12:43:21
<transcript>: the difference between

12:43:22
schrew: Chat: Connecting to chat server..

12:43:28
schrew: Chat: Connected.

12:43:28
<transcript>: The difference between stripe checkout and stripe Payment links. They're a bit harder to link back to a guest's account.

12:43:28
<transcript>: like can

12:43:35
<transcript>: Like, can they just put their email in and then you just match the email to your user. Is that how it works.

12:43:38
<transcript>: With the checkout.

12:43:43
<transcript>: You can just create a customer add their user ID from your system.

12:43:52
zxshan: @BishopDev Or a shit bucket

12:43:54
<transcript>: And then when you get the webhook, it's easy to associate them with the pricing table. You just attach their user ID to the html and wait till you get webhooks.

12:43:54
<transcript>: okay

12:43:56
greatgrievance: @tsoutsou_proutsou if youre in the US and dont have an EIN, you can use your SSN

12:43:57
<transcript>: Okay Pricing table.

12:43:57
bodhihawken: Stripe payment links can be created once and used a bunch of times (so static link on the frontend)

12:44:10
<transcript>: Does stripe require a tax ID or is it not required for small projects? Don't know. I didn't set this one up and it's been a long time since I set up a stripe account.

12:44:10
<transcript>: i think

12:44:15
tsoutsou_proutsou: @tsoutsou_proutsou europe :(

12:44:20
<transcript>: I think it has to have a tax ID. Does it not? I don't know. I could be wrong. I mean, a tax ID can be your social right real streamers. Use a P model.

12:44:24
<transcript>: That's funny.

12:44:26
greatgrievance: @tsoutsou_proutsou do you have a VAT ID?

12:44:29
bodhihawken: Stripe Checkout requires you to create a checkout session every time a guest wants to go there.

12:44:35
<transcript>: If you're in the US and don't have an ein, you can use your ssn. Yeah, great grievances here. Stripe payment links can be created once and used a bunch of times so static link on the front end.

12:44:45
tsoutsou_proutsou: @tsoutsou_proutsou i do

12:44:46
bodhihawken: Wouldnt recommend matching on an email. some people will use different emails for billing

12:44:50
<transcript>: Okay. Stripe checkout requires you to create a checkout session every time a guest wants to go there. So why do you need a checkout session? I guess my question is, what do you get? I'm going to do some Googling here. What do you get.

12:44:54
matty_twoshoes: @bodhihawken yep this is a great strategy

12:44:54
<transcript>: Different emails for billing. That makes sense.

12:44:54
<transcript>: but

12:44:57
<transcript>: But what do you get from.

12:45:02
matty_twoshoes: checkout session for different products and different variations

12:45:03
<transcript>: Stripe checkout versus payment link. I've obviously asked this question before.

12:45:10
<transcript>: What do you get from a custom session? Is it more secure or something? Like, what is it.

12:45:16
thdxr: you should probably use the checkout session, it's for more serious setups

12:45:20
greatgrievance: a checkout session has things like checkout total encoded in it. So you can't change the price mid-authorization

12:45:21
<transcript>: Payments on Your Website we integrate our pre built, Hosted payment.

12:45:22
bodhihawken: Well you can connect a guest to a user account with checkouts, those no guessing which user a payment is for

12:45:23
greatgrievance: iirc

12:45:23
thdxr: managing subs etc

12:45:31
<transcript>: That doesn't help me.

12:45:43
<transcript>: You should probably use the checkout sessions for more serious setups. Okay, we'll do it. That's what I've usually use. I mean, I've also done custom elements, but I'm not doing that.

12:45:49
<transcript>: Checkout session for different products and different variations.

12:45:56
<transcript>: Check on session has things like checkout Total encoded in it so you can't change the price mid authorization.

12:46:01
<transcript>: Okay. Well, you can connect a guest to a user account with checkouts.

12:46:12
<transcript>: Those no guessing which user a payment is for. Yeah. Just remember, it's like so many steps, but it's fine. Like you have to create a customer. You have to do all this stuff. Let's just do this.

12:46:16
<transcript>: Stripe, checkout.

12:46:16
<transcript>: getting started

12:46:17
<transcript>: Getting started.

12:46:20
<transcript>: There's like guides for this. Right. Here we go.

12:46:24
<transcript>: Get started quick start.

12:46:28
<transcript>: So I'm going to do this in sst, I guess.

12:46:28
bodhihawken: An easier way is with a pricing table if you have a set of a tiers ect

12:46:32
<transcript>: Back end node.

12:46:34
<transcript>: Front end.

12:46:36
thdxr: just make a stripe customer whenever someone signs up

12:46:38
<transcript>: React.

12:46:39
bodhihawken: that way you dont have to create the user or anything

12:46:40
<transcript>: Ish.

12:46:42
thdxr: that's what I do, it's optimistic!

12:46:45
<transcript>: Kind of react. Yeah. Pre built checkout page. Yes.

12:46:47
<transcript>: Okay.

12:46:57
<transcript>: Great grievance. Thank you for the one month sub. I appreciate it also. Runaway.

12:46:57
<transcript>: koda

12:46:59
<transcript>: Koda rue. Thank you for the follow.

12:46:59
<transcript>: just

12:46:59
bodhihawken: the only thing you have to do on the frontend is embed it, and add the user_id

12:47:12
<transcript>: Just make a stripe cluster whenever trying to stripe customer whenever someone signs up. Yep, yep, yep, yep. That way, you don't have to create the user or anything. That's what I do. It's optimistic. The only thing you have to do on the front end is embed it and add the user ID.

12:47:20
<transcript>: An easier way is with a pricing table. If you have a set of tiers, et cetera.

12:47:28
<transcript>: I don't think we're going to have tiers yet. You're saying Stripe pricing table is a whole nother product stripe pricing table.

12:47:32
greatgrievance: no free tier?

12:47:35
<transcript>: Embeddable Pricing table.

12:47:39
<transcript>: Is it built into stripe checkout.

12:47:39
<transcript>: so

12:47:43
<transcript>: So it's not using payment links. It's using checkout. This is cool.

12:47:43
<transcript>: i mean if it

12:47:43
bodhihawken: even with one tier, it does all the creating users ect

12:47:45
<transcript>: I mean if it makes this easier somehow.

12:47:50
<transcript>: Embedded Will you buy it? Just Slice pricing Information takes customers to a pre built checkout flow.

12:47:50
<transcript>: interesting

12:47:50
bodhihawken: yep connects to checkout

12:47:51
wallyg10: Should I use vim in vscode?

12:47:51
<transcript>: Interesting.

12:47:54
<transcript>: Can you SSR it.

12:48:06
bodhihawken: i belive so its just an iframe

12:48:09
<transcript>: Should I use vim in vs. Code? Wally I think so. Welcome to Chat. I think them is worth learning. I think the amount of efficiencies you gain editing text is very worth it.

12:48:11
<transcript>: Okay.

12:48:18
<transcript>: Even with one tier, it does all the creating users, et cetera. Connects the checkout. It's just an iframe okay.

12:48:20
ayushsharma: why vim in vscode SUBprise

12:48:21
<transcript>: Might do this.

12:48:26
<transcript>: We'll look at this. But first I'm going to go and start setting up some infrastructure.

12:48:26
<transcript>: we've got the

12:48:30
<transcript>: We've got the pre built checkout page. So let's see here. Setup server.

12:48:39
<transcript>: Stripe and are there any like ssc example apps with Stripe stuff implemented that'd be cool.

12:48:39
<transcript>: just save

12:48:41
smilingbig: some people like it wallyg10

12:48:41
<transcript>: Just save me some time.

12:48:56
<transcript>: Why vim and Vs code? I mean if you're just like going to stick with Vs code and you want to use Vs code, I think it's still worth adding the vim bindings. I think they add to your productivity over time.

12:49:01
bodhihawken: using pricing table means you dont have to do anything server-side except for handling webhooks

12:49:05
<transcript>: And I don't think you need to go to something. I knew them. Unless you just want a hobby. I think it's more like for fun. The vim is the real efficiency gain, right.

12:49:06
ayushsharma: gvim ?

12:49:14
<transcript>: Using pricing table means you don't have to do anything serversite except for handling webhooks. So you're saying bodie. It's kind of like.

12:49:14
<transcript>: the

12:49:20
thdxr: vscode is sloooow

12:49:23
cosmiclasagna: am back hi

12:49:23
coolpantstv: Need to go right to emacs

12:49:27
bodhihawken: yes, exactly

12:49:28
<transcript>: The payment links in that way, but it's the benefits of the sessions created by Checkout. Oh, because it's an iframe so, they're doing all of the checkout stuff for you vs. Code is slow. Yeah, I guess that's true. Less lightweight.

12:49:31
<transcript>: So let's do this.

12:49:31
<transcript>: stripe

12:49:36
<transcript>: Stripe Pricing Table versus checkout.

12:49:42
<transcript>: Are there any cons.

12:49:46
<transcript>: Anybody know if there's a cons to the pricing table.

12:49:46
<transcript>: do i

12:49:48
greatgrievance: vscode is slow?

12:49:50
<transcript>: Do I still have the ability to link.

12:49:51
bodhihawken: only con is

12:49:54
greatgrievance: maybe i have too much hardware

12:49:56
<transcript>: Link to my customers easily only Con is.

12:50:00
smilingbig: yeah compared to vim GreatGrievance

12:50:05
<transcript>: Yeah I've never noticed vs. Code being slow either, but I always use really expensive computers.

12:50:07
bodhihawken: you attatch the user_id on the frontend

12:50:11
bodhihawken: ill send an example

12:50:14
<transcript>: You attach the user ID on the front end.

12:50:17
<transcript>: Okay. That'd be great. Buddy.

12:50:17
<transcript>: dax

12:50:19
smilingbig: but you can make vim pretty slow too KEKW

12:50:19
coolpantstv: What a flex

12:50:19
<transcript>: Dax, is there an SST.

12:50:19
<transcript>: like stripe

12:50:24
jmejam: If your computer struggles with VS Code, time for an upgrade LUL

12:50:25
<transcript>: Like stripe. There should be like a stripe. Kickstart on ssd like a stripe. Example. App.

12:50:25
<transcript>: that would be

12:50:27
<transcript>: That would be very helpful.

12:50:31
dnbull: hey hey KonCha

12:50:34
<transcript>: What was the flex? Did I flex school pants, me.

12:50:35
thdxr: there isn't but we should make that

12:50:39
smilingbig: I think it depends on what plugins you have installed in vscode too I guess

12:50:47
coolpantstv: "I only use really expensive computers"

12:50:48
<transcript>: Nimbles. Here How's the weather in Miami today, Dean Bull, there isn't. But we should make that. Yeah, you should. It would save me a lot of time right now. I think it'd depends on what plugins you have installed in Vs. Code, too, I guess.

12:50:55
greatgrievance: @smilingbig Can't argue with that, but it feels a bit like saying "Musk is richer than Bezos"... they're both rich af

12:50:59
rvcasdev: Miami gang üëã

12:51:00
levidayne: @bodhihawken You can pass the user email to the checkout session so it will match though any email change would require more code than just customer ID

12:51:03
<transcript>: Okay. Now I've got this decision paralysis that I don't love. I have experience. So the only thing I'm here's, the cons for this pricing table thing. The cons for me are it's an iframe so, I feel like it'll be less easy to work with.

12:51:06
<transcript>: Styling wise. Make it fit all that stuff.

12:51:09
<transcript>: There's that problem. But then.

12:51:09
<transcript>: there's also i just

12:51:10
smilingbig: GreatGrievance very valid point

12:51:13
dnbull: @thdxr i do a lot of stripe at work but never used SST. I can probably try to spike it out üëÄ

12:51:20
<transcript>: There's also, I just don't know it as well. I've done stripe checkout implementations like, I don't know, six, seven times. So I just know, kind of like all the gotchas. And it feels like I can kind of just go that way.

12:51:22

12:51:38
<transcript>: is it

12:51:42

12:51:46
bodhihawken: and thats it on the webhook it will return the correct email and reference id

12:52:01
<transcript>: Let's see the size up. Three days of rain.

12:52:03
coolpantstv: All of this money and still scamming us poor people

12:52:07

12:52:14
l_mbert: @thdxr now he needs a new one!

12:52:17

12:52:18
smilingbig: I have a new macbook, but I use a 10 year old laptop instead KEKW

12:52:22
bodhihawken: on the webhook checkout_completed.client_reference_id

12:52:24
<transcript>: my computer

12:52:34

12:52:41

12:52:47
<transcript>: Why Smiling Big is it a new work, macbook? And you don't want to use it because they spy.

12:52:50
<transcript>: Okay.

12:52:53
<transcript>: I need to start doing and stop thinking.

12:52:53
<transcript>: too much

12:52:58
<transcript>: Too much thinking not enough doing let's build out.

12:52:59
smilingbig: yeah they won't let me put linux on the macbook

12:53:14
<transcript>: Pop D. Let's build out. Wait. Did I not already have ssd open? Oh, I do it's right there. Yeah. Here's. Ssd. Okay, so this is the new rewrite. I've spent so much time building ui in here. We've got so much going on.

12:53:16
<transcript>: Mostly done actually.

12:53:22
<transcript>: But we're going to add some stripe stuff to our app stack.

12:53:22

12:53:25
jmejam: Yea, my Macbook just collects dust unless I am attending conferences etc.

12:53:29

<transcript>: I should have just made a YouTube video today. This has been a design.

13:10:59
<transcript>: A disaster.

13:10:59
<transcript>: it hasn't been that

13:11:03
<transcript>: It hasn't been that bad, I guess. Okay. Now we got stacks. We got packages.

13:11:07
<transcript>: Okay, functions.

13:11:07
<transcript>: core

13:11:10
<transcript>: Core. Now I'm going to drop a new package in here.

13:11:10
<transcript>: let's

13:11:11
thdxr: are you still gonna make the yt video

13:11:13
<transcript>: Let's see, downloads.

13:11:13
<transcript>: no where

13:11:16
<transcript>: No. Where did I put that code.

13:11:18
<transcript>: Archive.

13:11:20
<transcript>: Packages.

13:11:24
smilingbig: yeah my biggest issue with macos is I can't delete finder

13:11:26
silverlp: even i can do mv statmuse ./code/statmuse.com

13:11:29
<transcript>: Okay. Well, we're getting there.

13:11:31
bodhihawken: I put a full example of the stripe billing portal, webhook handling and pricing table stuff in there XD

13:11:32
<transcript>: Slow. This is slower. What.

13:11:32
<transcript>: is this finder

13:11:36
<transcript>: Is this Finder? What's wrong with Finder doesn't even build from source.

13:11:36
<transcript>: rather than

13:11:39
smilingbig: actually my biggest issue is that window management is super shit

13:11:44
<transcript>: Rather than Sfile run asdf local node js 1613 one. Oh, Alice, there. That would have done what I just did.

13:11:44
<transcript>: interesting

13:11:45
<transcript>: Interesting.

13:11:45
<transcript>: can't even cut

13:11:47
<transcript>: Can't even cut.

13:11:47
<transcript>: he's still

13:11:51
<transcript>: He's still going to make the YouTube video. I am dex. I think I'm going to make it next week.

13:11:51
<transcript>: i need to make sure

13:11:55
<transcript>: I need to make sure I'm going to get all this stapmy stuff done. And at this pace.

13:11:55

13:11:56
<transcript>: Even.

13:11:56
<transcript>: i can do

13:12:01
<transcript>: I can do move. Status. Code. Status. Oh, that would have worked.

13:12:03
<transcript>: That would have worked.

13:12:05
<transcript>: Okay.

13:12:07
<transcript>: Do this.

13:12:09
<transcript>: I'm going to rename this.

13:12:11
<transcript>: To web.

13:12:15
<transcript>: Drop it out here.

13:12:18
thdxr: you can get the statmuse stuff done faster if you install arch

13:12:18
<transcript>: And then.

13:12:25
<transcript>: Out here.

13:12:30
<transcript>: That was pretty fast. I don't know.

13:12:34
<transcript>: Whatever. I only type like 100 words a minute. What do I know.

13:12:35
l_mbert: @thdxr blazingly fast even

13:12:50
smilingbig: 100wpm is good no worries LUL

13:12:51
thdxr: this whole thing woulda taken me 1min because I use arch

13:12:54
<transcript>: If I put a full example of the stripe billing, Porter, webhook handling and pricing table stuff in there. Okay, thank you, bodie. We will take a look here in just a second. I'm just getting my ssc stuff set up. Actually, my biggest issue is that window management is super shit. Oh, you're talking about just on Mac OS. I get why you guys use linux, but I don't think there are answers to all the things that I use for streaming.

13:12:54
<transcript>: and media

13:12:56
<transcript>: And Media stuff.

13:12:58
<transcript>: This whole thing would have taken.

13:12:58
<transcript>: me one

13:12:59
<transcript>: Me 1 minute because.

13:13:04
bishopdev: shit ? YABAI !!!! YABAI is awesome for window management

13:13:11
smilingbig: I don't use arch btw

13:13:12
<transcript>: You can get the satin new stuff done faster if you install arch. I don't think I can because I can't run it on this. I do use you buy. I'm not a huge fan actually.

13:13:14
silverlp: asahi lets go

13:13:15
jokestera_e: I really appreciate the cmd + ~ on mac I don't understand why windows doesnt have that

13:13:20
<transcript>: Okay. I'm going to make up for it. We're going to move faster. Let's see. Cd code.

13:13:21
thdxr: shut up and install arch

13:13:25
<transcript>: Okay.

13:13:25

13:14:18
<transcript>: Okay, we got functions.

13:14:18
<transcript>: core

13:14:23
<transcript>: Core. Okay. So now we're going to actually be able to start writing some code. Finally.

13:14:25

<transcript>: Did you see React? Miami is doing a game show today. What kind of game show? Dax? I didn't see it. If you're going to install arch, you need to build it first. Can't run somebody else's. Arch. Build that's just immoral.

13:15:06
<transcript>: Shut up and install art. Oh, my goodness. I really appreciate the cmd plus, whatever on Mac. I don't understand why Windows doesn't have that. Yeah, no, it's great.

13:16:43
silverlp: thdxr can you explain SST in monkey language

13:16:43

13:17:08
thdxr: the keyboard is garbage

13:17:16
<transcript>: That it's. You just can't buy mode 80s anymore. They don't even make them anymore. What I got to do here pmpm install probably pinpoint.

thdxr: NO

13:18:40
<transcript>: You're.

13:18:40
<transcript>: not

13:18:46

<transcript>: No, I won't show it.

13:19:06
thdxr: react to something that hasn't been released yet

13:19:08
<transcript>: You can watch it on stream, but don't show you want me to watch it? And no one else can see it? But they can see my reaction.

13:19:09
smilingbig: non takes are my go to

13:19:12
<transcript>: Yes, that's a great idea. We'll do that.

13:19:18

13:19:23
smilingbig: ta

13:19:28
<transcript>: So the rest thing is so interesting, because if you're not into russ, I don't do any rust development. I'm not part of the rust community. Aside from just having friends that are into it.

13:19:34
<transcript>: If you're not really a part of it, I'm not taking the time to really read and understand the situation, that much.

13:19:34
<transcript>: and it

13:19:37
<transcript>: And it's just weird to see so many people.

13:19:42
pbertrand_dev: imho the rust community seems a little bit toxic

13:19:45
<transcript>: So enthralled in a discussion that you just don't care about at all. I mean, I guess maybe I should care. I don't know. You only care about so many things.

13:19:48
<transcript>: And I just don't care.

13:19:55
thdxr: Strager v Prime

13:19:55
<transcript>: But it's weird to see something that so many people care about so much. And there are people I'm close with. But it's just like, I'm sorry.

13:19:55
<transcript>: i don't care

13:19:56
<transcript>: I don't care.

13:20:00
thdxr: splitting the world

13:20:02
<transcript>: Straeger versus prime? Is it Straeger versus Prime.

13:20:03
thdxr: a deep schism

13:20:06
greatgrievance: there's rust drama?

13:20:06
thdxr: will we ever recover

13:20:09
smilingbig: I enjoyed it because it was drama LUL

13:20:09
<transcript>: I like both streger and prime. Why can't people just all be on the same team.

13:20:13
4836276578235: I mean legally it makes sense right. People dont moan that .NET or Python is a trademark lol

13:20:15
<transcript>: A deep schism. Will we ever recover.

13:20:18
thdxr: yeah they went at it

13:20:27
thdxr: tbh I think strager was in the wrong

13:20:29
<transcript>: Okay. I'm going to watch this video. And you guys aren't going to see the video, but you're going to watch me react to it. Okay.

13:20:31
<transcript>: Non takes are my go to.

13:20:35
<transcript>: And then we'll do Twitter time.

13:20:39
rvallez_: @thdxr whos strager? I know prime only

13:20:43
<transcript>: To be honest, I think streger was in the wrong. Can you give me the short version of what was said.

13:20:43
jaythedeveloper: what did i miss strager vs prime?

13:20:45
smilingbig: thdxr was this on twitter?

13:20:52
smilingbig: RVallez_ another streamer, good dude

13:20:56
<transcript>: Or just paste the tweet and we'll look at it together. And I'll tell you what I think, whether I think Straeger was in the wrong or not.

13:21:01
thdxr: Strager was blaming prime for creating a panic

13:21:02
gitpush_gitpaid: i think most of these rust people are posers. being a rust developer is like being a goth in the mid 90s

13:21:04

thdxr: someone find the thread

schrew: Strager accusing prime of spreading fear: https://twitter.com/strager/status/1646266408614109184

13:22:57
<transcript>: Prime did panic a bit. A streamer that's been doing Twitch Dev for a long time. I enjoyed trigger streams. I've only caught a few of them because he does them late at night. But I had a weird schedule last week when my wife was gone. I was up late watching late night streams, and I caught a couple of straighter streams.

13:22:57
<transcript>: i really like

13:22:59
<transcript>: I really like straeger.

13:23:04
<transcript>: He's just like one of those people that clearly doesn't care what people think of him. I really like those kind of people.

13:23:05
pbertrand_dev: your wife is gone?

13:23:07
thdxr: it's this thread: https://twitter.com/strager/status/1646294986412150785

<transcript>: Lark.

13:23:28
<transcript>: Dak gave me a preview of a video that he's going to launch on Monday, or release publish on Monday on YouTube.

13:23:28
<transcript>: and

13:23:36
smilingbig: maybe jesus is gitpush_gitpaid KEKW

13:23:37
<transcript>: And I was just reacting to it. Without you guys getting to see it, it's a preview. Nobody's going to see it. But you got to see my reaction to it. And oh, my goodness, it's good. It's so funny.

13:23:40
<transcript>: I love this idea. So much.

13:23:45
glamshatterskull: @Schrew loved this call out

13:23:45
<transcript>: All the parts where I'm talking but you can't see me will be replaced by Frank. Got it.

13:23:51
gitpush_gitpaid: is it the green screen video LUL

13:23:53
<transcript>: Okay. There's the Tweet. Okay, here we go. My wife is not. No. She was last week. She was out of town.

13:23:54
thdxr: yeah

13:23:56
glamshatterskull: gmern all

13:23:57
bishopdev: @thdxr I think strager is a bit in the right

13:23:59
<transcript>: He's a good dude and smart Jesus is a savage like streger, though.

13:24:08
<transcript>: Love this. Call out. It is the green screen. Is it the green screen? Video? Yes, turk. Good morning, glam.

13:24:15
<transcript>: Okay, Bishop thinks triggers in the right. Dax thinks triggers in the wrong. And we're all going to be the judge.

13:24:15
<transcript>: right now

13:24:16
<transcript>: Right now.

13:24:16
bishopdev: 'I wonder what the blowback will be .. ' that's just calling for blowback

13:24:18
<transcript>: On Twitter. Time.

13:24:27
<transcript>: Okay, so we got a tweet. Here.

13:24:27
<transcript>: this tweet

13:24:31
<transcript>: This tweet is from the Primogen. The name.

13:24:33
<transcript>: Is the pramigen.

13:24:33
<transcript>: i wonder

13:24:33
glamshatterskull: it's obvious click farming to me

13:24:34
greatgrievance: there's no right/wrong/win/lose... you're all caught up in drama

13:24:34
4836276578235: you made me just order a magic trackpad lol

13:24:35
jokestera_e: I really like the music in your transitions

13:24:36
smilingbig: I don't believe in right and wrong PepeLaugh

13:24:41
smilingbig: KEKW

13:24:42
pbertrand_dev: I think if people have 3 tweets in a row that disagree they should box irl and that decides it

13:24:43
smilingbig: holy shit

13:24:48
thdxr: anyone that's tagging people in a thread being like "these people are bad" I'm automatically against

13:24:51
smilingbig: let me clip that

13:24:54
<transcript>: I wonder what the blowback I should say right up front here, I see three people in this, the Primogen, streger and trav. I am big fans of all three of those people. Just want everyone to know that before I read any of this. Okay. Big fan of all three of these people. I think they're all excellent humans. Okay? And that doesn't mean I can't.

13:24:54
<transcript>: have

13:24:55
jokestera_e: Same fans of all three

13:25:06
<transcript>: Have takes about who I think I side with on this because ultimately, when there's an issue and there are different opinions, you got to land somewhere unless you just literally don't care. And I might not care.

13:25:13
<transcript>: I probably won't care because I know this whole rust foundation situation. I just don't care, but let's read. Let's just have an open mind here.

13:25:22
gitpush_gitpaid: yoooo that dude trav gave me a sub in another channel. i default side with him

13:25:23
bishopdev: yeah, that one was a bad take, tagging people, but he is right about both theo and prime doing that

13:25:25
<transcript>: These are all three great individuals. Okay, I respect them all greatly. I wonder what the blowback is going to be with russ attempting to be in the linux kernel in their recent trademark policy.

13:25:25
<transcript>: okay

13:25:31
<transcript>: Okay with the russ. With russ attempting to be in the linux kernel. I didn't know this, so rust.

13:25:31
<transcript>: the

13:25:35
kubahasek: hello hello! what did I miss?

13:25:43
<transcript>: The rust foundation presumably is pushing to be a part of the linux kernel and their recent trademark Privacy. Okay, to me, this will be one of the biggest setbacks, even if it's corrected in text. The spirit will be heavy over rust for a bit.

13:25:43
<transcript>: str

13:25:45
greatgrievance: this isn't drama over what's happened... it's drama over what _could_ happen. Which is even worse...

13:25:52
<transcript>: Stringer, why not interview the people involved instead of spreading fear? Interview the people involved? Who are the people involved? Okay, so streger, saying.

13:25:54
<transcript>: Why not.

13:25:54
<transcript>: interview

13:26:01
<transcript>: Interview the people the russ foundation, presumably. Maybe the linux kernel people. Maybe linus himself.

13:26:08
<transcript>: Okay, instead of spreading fear. So Shreger. Saying prime is spreading fear.

13:26:20
<transcript>: Okay, trav plus one, the foundation could have avoided spreading a lot of unnecessary fear and backlash if they had done this before proposing their document. So Travis saying.

13:26:26
greatgrievance: i guess that probably actually sides me strager though

13:26:35
<transcript>: I'm not like doing this for you all. I'm not talking slowly and rehashing everything. I just literally have to to understand everyone's points of view and what they're saying. Maybe you can read it once and just know for me. I still don't know who signed trav's on, so I got to read it again. Plus one.

13:26:47
<transcript>: Up the foundation could have avoided spreading a lot of unnecessary fear and backlash. So Travis saying Primogen is not spreading fear, right? Is that what Travis saying? Travis, are you still here.

13:26:47
<transcript>: travis

13:26:49
daglee: I wonder in how many countries the new rust policies is enforceable. I feel like the document is written like somebody that think US is the whole world.

13:26:55
<transcript>: Travis saying he could clarify for me. I think Travis saying that the fear spreading was actually from the foundation. If.

13:26:55
<transcript>: they had done

13:26:58
<transcript>: They had done this before proposing their document.

13:27:11
<transcript>: Okay. And then streger says, and this is the one that was sent to me. The rust foundation didn't spread fear. People like theo and the Primogen are the ones spreading feature freer. Okay.

13:27:11
<transcript>: now that

13:27:14
gitpush_gitpaid: na some of that Rust foundation policy is ridiculous. you can be banned from using Rust if you run an event and allow guns in even if its legal. but then go on to say you must follow local health regulations.

13:27:19
thdxr: the issue is that by putting this policy forth as a real thing it makes people lose faith in how the foundation thinks - whether or not they actually enforce it

13:27:23
<transcript>: Now that I see a fourth person, I should also say another person that I love and respect is theo. All four of these people are people I love and respect that makes this whole situation suck because now.

13:27:23
smilingbig: https://clips.twitch.tv/SucculentCallousIguanaBloodTrail-QDVl6f964BeSYiaJ

13:27:27
smilingbig: KEKW

13:27:29
<transcript>: Daddy and mommy are fighting at the dinner table. And I don't like it because I like all you people. I like all of you.

13:27:29
<transcript>: you're all

13:27:31
<transcript>: You're all good people.

13:27:31
<transcript>: you all mean

13:27:36
smilingbig: couldn't cut it perfectly

13:27:40
<transcript>: You all mean well, and then there's just disagreements. And it's all because of some rust thing. Can we all just, like, not write rust or something? I don't know. I say that.

13:27:40
<transcript>: i'm not somebody who

13:27:45
smilingbig: which one is mommy?

13:27:46
pbertrand_dev: I find it confusing they asked for feedback and they got feedback.

13:27:47
glamshatterskull: @thdxr it doesn't do that for me.... at all.

13:27:49
nft_scam: PoroSad rust did this

13:27:52
<transcript>: I'm not somebody who I guess cares enough about one language. If there were like a bunch of drama and it were like affecting me, I would probably just stop using the thing that sounds like a take, but it's just like my personality.

13:27:52
rvallez_: OCaml season is coming

13:27:54
jokestera_e: It sucks people cant have an opinion without drama breaking out

13:27:56
gitpush_gitpaid: their policy literally mentions "rost".... what the hell is that

13:28:01
jaythedeveloper: everyone needs CRC Rust Remover to get rid of the rust

13:28:04
greatgrievance: @daglee GitHub, GCP, AWS, Azure, DO, etc all all US companies.. that helps with enforcement because the cease and desist goes to them

13:28:07
<transcript>: I guess maybe I haven't used rust. Maybe if I use rust, I'd get obsessed with it. And I'd feel this way. I don't feel any feelings about any languages doing anything. What is wrong with me? I think this just turned into me. I'm just talking about me now. Why don't I have feelings or emotions.

13:28:13
<transcript>: Or care about anything very deeply. Someone answered that question for me. That's what this is really about.

13:28:13
<transcript>: that's

13:28:14
smilingbig: yeah ocaml let's go KEKW

13:28:15
<transcript>: That's what I want to know.

13:28:28
pbertrand_dev: @adamdotdev you need to make your emotions mutable

13:28:31
<transcript>: Why am I a robot? Okay. And then the next thing is prime. Yes, they did. At least one person just deactivated their multi thousand follower account on Twitter because it contained the word rust in it. I'm having to rework a bunch of hours I've done in a course. Many others have expressed similar.

13:28:31
ocelot2123: are you secretly a robot thats why you are always so nice to chatgpt?

13:28:36
<transcript>: They most certainly spread fear. So I think he's talking about rust.

13:28:36
<transcript>: rust

13:28:37
<transcript>: Rust.

13:28:38
thdxr: anyway this drama is basically people who pretend to use rust pretending to care

13:28:39
gitpush_gitpaid: thats why i wrote a tweet propping Linus Torvalds. got a whole ass 1 like and 1 retweet. yea im famous

13:28:42
kubahasek: everytime I come here, not at the start, it's just Adam reacting to someone or just being angry about something

13:28:46
<transcript>: I love her. She's one of my favorite followers on Twitter, and I was so sad when she left, but I'm forgetting I keep want to say.

13:28:49
kubahasek: rust for typescript devs

13:28:51
<transcript>: Russ hobbyist. Some may already say it.

13:28:51
<transcript>: oh wow

13:29:00
daglee: @GreatGrievance Sure but if I'm doing a blog I wouldn't host it in the US.

13:29:02
thdxr: HobbyistRust

13:29:07
thdxr: she was so great

13:29:11
<transcript>: Oh wow. You guys have been talking and I forgot to look at chat rust hobbyists. He's talking about rust hobbyist, and he's on rework. So there is something I would definitely be upset about if I were prime, if he doesn't get to do what he was planning on doing with the course. That would be very annoying. And I would be very pissed at whoever was creating this situation. So I do understand the.

13:29:11
<transcript>: frustration

13:29:12
<transcript>: Frustration.

13:29:12
<transcript>: for prime

13:29:22
gitpush_gitpaid: its ok adam, you continue doing you. youre doing great at it. dont worry about keeping up with the chat

13:29:23
<transcript>: For prime to be frustrated if he's working on trying to teach people a language, and then the language is like, we might sue you. That does sound bad. And then streger left.

13:29:25
coolpantstv: Are you guys aware that @thdxr has more Rust in production than any of these people

13:29:26
<transcript>: So Primogen says.

13:29:26
<transcript>: these

13:29:32
thdxr: hehe

13:29:33
<transcript>: These things. So the prime is being serious, not telling a joke. And streger laughed. I think that's kind of.

13:29:33
<transcript>: like if

13:29:35
glamshatterskull: i would also laugh at that.

13:29:41
greatgrievance: strager is a savage like that

13:29:42
<transcript>: Like if I know Straeger a little bit from his streams, that's just kind of like trigger's Personality strikers is kind of like fu. That's just like a joke.

13:29:44
thdxr: I got some crazy mean comments from my rust prodding lol

13:29:49
pbertrand_dev: @CoolpantsTV Rust code or Rusty code?

13:29:52
<transcript>: I disagree with you. I'm just going to laugh at you. This is like when dax says yes, when somebody's like, dax, you suck. And he's like, yes, that's what streger just did.

13:29:52
<transcript>: jd four

13:29:57
<transcript>: Jd Four Codes Another person that I love this thread is full of people that I love.

13:29:57
<transcript>: okay this is

13:30:01
<transcript>: Okay, this is another side tangent. A little rant.

13:30:01
<transcript>: i keep

13:30:03
bishopdev: strager made a good point initially but just went fu after

13:30:07
<transcript>: I keep learning of long held feuds in like the twitch dev community.

13:30:07
<transcript>: like

13:30:23
<transcript>: Like twitch streamers that don't like each other and I can't untangle the web of who likes who and who I can be friends with, or who I can't be because they're not friends with them. And it's so annoying. Can we all just be friendly and kind.

13:30:23
<transcript>: and like

13:30:26
<transcript>: And like each other. And I'm not saying that.

13:30:26
<transcript>: any one person's at fault

13:30:28
<transcript>: Any one person's at fault.

13:30:28
<transcript>: it's just

13:30:29
rvallez_: nope

13:30:30
zxshan: Easy Adam. It's Dax vs Everyone

13:30:33
rvallez_: peace was never an option

13:30:35
thdxr: this is 100% high school all over again and I love it

13:30:39
pbertrand_dev: Theres been a big feud between Teej and Trash

13:30:40
jokestera_e: I kinda wanna blame dax

13:30:42
glamshatterskull: twitter is a trash fire

13:30:43
zxshan: One clickbait hot take at a time xD

13:30:44
ayushsharma: friendly is not a option

13:30:48
<transcript>: It's just. I know relationships are hard. The internet brings us all together. We're not all necessarily compatible. We don't want to be friendly with everybody because we don't necessarily share a lot in common. So I get it. I get why it's the case. I don't blame anybody. It just sucks. It just sucks. And I wish it was different. I wish we all were just okay with each other. We can all just celebrate the good parts of all of each other.

13:30:48
<transcript>: and forget about all the bad

13:30:58
<transcript>: And forget about all the bad parts and not be jerks to each other and say things that are just mean spirited. I wish we could all just get along. I sound like the biggest.

13:31:04
<transcript>: Mr. Rogers Character Ever. Don't I? Why can't we all just get along.

13:31:04
glamshatterskull: twitter isn't for getting along

13:31:06
thdxr: I'm beefing with trash ever since he dissed my outfit

13:31:12
<transcript>: Okay, I'm going to start trying to read some of the chat because I just was in my own head there for a little bit, not really paying attention. Rust did this.

13:31:15
feenskee: LUL

13:31:15
thdxr: Adam is the guidance counselor

13:31:15
<transcript>: Couldn't cut it perfectly. Which one is mommy.

13:31:15
<transcript>: you guys

13:31:16
daglee: Fights are bad! Mkay!

13:31:21
<transcript>: You guys found a clip. Oh, boy, don't clip me. There's nothing worth clipping here. We're just hanging out.

13:31:21
<transcript>: anyone that

13:31:22
ptrhvns: We can't forget about the differences. Building good relationships sometimes requires hard work.

13:31:24
<transcript>: Anyone that's tagging people in a thread like.

13:31:24
<transcript>: being like

13:31:35
<transcript>: Being like, these people are bad. I'm automatically against. Oh, I see your argument, dex. I definitely see that argument. Let's see. I got to scroll further up. You guys have talked a lot. You talked a lot.

13:31:37
<transcript>: Okay.

13:31:44
greatgrievance: not getting along all the time is also fine.. as long as we can co-exist, collab, and be somewhat humane

13:31:51
ptrhvns: If tolerance were easy, there wouldn't be a word for it

13:31:58
<transcript>: I think streger is a bit in the right Bishop says. I wonder what the blowback will be. That's just calling for blowback. It's obvious. Click Farming to me. So glam thinks glam. I'm assuming you mean you think prime is click farming. Great grievance. There's no right wrong win, lose. You're all caught up in drama. You made me just order a magic trackpad. Oh, that's random. Really? Like.

13:31:58
<transcript>: the music

13:32:02
glamshatterskull: 10000000000%

13:32:06
<transcript>: The music and your transitions. Thank you. Jokester. This is an emotional roller coaster right here. If I had emotions, I would be all over the place.

13:32:13
jokestera_e: wow he really behind

13:32:14
zxshan: @GreatGrievance +1

13:32:16
<transcript>: Okay. I don't believe in right and wrong. Actually. True story. Smiling. Neither do I. I actually don't. I just think like false circumstance.

13:32:16
<transcript>: and all whatever

13:32:16
andreaslorozco: you do have emotions

13:32:17
<transcript>: And all whatever.

13:32:17
<transcript>: i

13:32:24
<transcript>: I think if people have three tweets in a row that disagree, they should box in real life, and that decides.

13:32:31
<transcript>: Okay same fans of all three Yo that dude trab gave me a sub in another channel. I default side with him.

13:32:31
<transcript>: bishop

13:32:35
ocelot2123: code boxing match

13:32:43
<transcript>: Bishop dev. Yeah, that one was a bad take tagging people, but he is right about both theo and prime doing that. Hello? What did I miss? Kuba. We're just talking about this situation with the rust Foundation.

13:32:43
<transcript>: this is

13:32:50
<transcript>: This is in drama. Over what's happened. It's drama over what could happen, which even worse, I guess that probably.

13:32:50
<transcript>: actually

13:33:03
thdxr: I made this tweet so I can reply to annoying people to it: https://twitter.com/thdxr/status/1646856253522550784

13:33:10
<transcript>: Actually sides me streger, though. Sides you a streger. Okay. Yeah. It sounded like you were kind of siding with drager. Great grievance. I wonder in how many countries the new rust policies is enforceable? I feel like the document is written like somebody that thinks us is the whole world. Sounds about right? Not some of the rust foundation policy is ridiculous. You can be banned from using rest if you run an event.

13:33:10
<transcript>: issue

13:33:16
sasankthapa: @ocelot2123 first to finish a site wins... TS vs Rust

13:33:19
<transcript>: Issue is that by putting this policy forth as a real thing, it makes people lose faith in how the foundation thinks whether or not they actually enforce it.

13:33:21
<transcript>: Okay.

13:33:30
<transcript>: Couldn't cut a perfectly finding confusing. They asked for feedback, and they got feedback. It doesn't do that for me at all. Russ did this. Oh, camel season is coming up.

13:33:48
<transcript>: This is so fun. Just reading you guys'thoughts in real time sucked. Well, five minutes behind it sucked. People can't have an opinion without drama breaking out. Their policy literally mentions roast. What the hell is that? Everyone needs CRC rest. Remover to get rid of the rest. Okay, I'm going to keep reading. You need to make your emotions mutable.

13:33:48
<transcript>: they don't change

13:34:09
<transcript>: They don't change. Are you secretly a robot? That's why you're all always so nice to chat. Tbt may be awful lot. Maybe I like that you brought that back to me because ultimately, it's what I'm looking for here. Just let's just talk about me anyway. This drama is basically people who pretend to use rust, pretending to care. Dax has had rust in production since 2000, and.

13:34:09
<transcript>: eighteen

13:34:14
<transcript>: 18 people. And there is life and death on the line. Sorry, I'm kind of trolling you, dax. That's why I wrote a.

13:34:14
<transcript>: tweet

13:34:26
<transcript>: Tweet propping Linus Torvold got a whole ass one, like in one retreat. You're famous every time I come here, not at the start. It's just Adam reacting to something. Or just being angry about something. Oh, no.

13:34:26
<transcript>: i'm not an

13:34:29
<transcript>: I'm not angry. I hope I don't come up as angry.

13:34:29
<transcript>: i literally don't

13:34:32
<transcript>: I literally don't feel emotion. So I don't think I've ever been angry.

13:34:32
<transcript>: i

13:34:47
<transcript>: I may get a little worked up. I'm going to share my actual thoughts before I read Dexter Sweet. I'm going to share my thoughts on this. Like who I think is right, slash wrong. If I think someone is right or wrong, I'm going to share them. I have thoughts. I'm just needing to read all of your thoughts so it helps me. Crystallize.

13:34:47
<transcript>: what i think

13:34:49
<transcript>: What I think about the world.

13:34:49
<transcript>: rust for

13:34:57
<transcript>: Rust for typescript. Des. Sure, but if I'm doing a blog, I wouldn't host it in the US. Hobbyist. Rust. Thank you, dax. She was so great. I miss her. Dearly.

13:34:57
<transcript>: i

13:35:00
<transcript>: I've tweeted. It before. Look at this.

13:35:06
<transcript>: Look at this. Look at this. Just want to show from Adam Dev.

13:35:09
glamshatterskull: drama coverage is also drama LUL

13:35:12
<transcript>: Hobbyist I know I have treated.

13:35:12
<transcript>: no

13:35:13
<transcript>: No.

13:35:16
<transcript>: Russ.

13:35:16
<transcript>: hobby

13:35:17
<transcript>: Hobbyist.

13:35:17
<transcript>: wasn't it rust

13:35:20
<transcript>: Wasn't it rust hobbyist? Oh, no.

13:35:23
<transcript>: How do you spell it.

13:35:23
<transcript>: i

13:35:30
<transcript>: I've tweeted something about her being one of my favorite followers on Twitter, so I was very disappointed. I have a personal investment in this situation.

13:35:36
pbertrand_dev: hobbyistrust

13:35:41
<transcript>: Are you guys aware that dax has more rust in production than these people? Exactly. Straighter is savage. I got some crazy mean comments from my rust prodding.

13:35:56
gitpush_gitpaid: na i need to know what hobbies adam was talking about in those tweets. let me find out hes a part of the local yarn club

13:35:57
<transcript>: Sugar made a good point initially but just went Fu after that's kind of my read. No easy, adamant stacks versus everyone. Peace was never an option. This is 100% high school all over again and I love it. There's been a big feud between peach and Trash. Has it really.

13:35:57
<transcript>: they don't tea

13:35:59
<transcript>: They don't tease in trash. I think they're just joking.

13:36:03
<transcript>: I don't think they actually have.

13:36:20
<transcript>: An actual feud kind of want to blame DAX Twitter is a trash fire. One quick, late, hot take at a time. Friendly is not an option. Twitter isn't for getting along and beefing with trash ever since he dissed my outfit. You guys are just joking, though, DAX, you guys aren't actually beefing with trash. I don't think trash could beef with anybody.

13:36:20
<transcript>: it's like

13:36:22
<transcript>: It's like Me. Beefing with somebody.

13:36:22
<transcript>: fights or

13:36:31
daglee: But tbh, the main reason I use rust atm is that it can be used from C and doesn't have a GC. That removes a lot of languages I could use for my projects.

13:36:33
<transcript>: Fights or bad okay we can't forget about the differences. Building good relationships sometimes requires hard work, not getting along all the time. Sign as long as we can coach this collab and be with some human if tanger is either going to be a word for it, I'm absorbing.

13:36:33
<transcript>: all of your

13:36:35
<transcript>: All of your takes.

13:36:35
<transcript>: and i'm going to

13:36:36
<transcript>: And I'm going to.

13:36:36
<transcript>: have

13:36:39
<transcript>: Have my take in a minute. Just give me a minute.

13:36:54
<transcript>: Oh, he's really behind. Uhoh, you do have emotions code boxing match. It is usually really vivo. Okay, maybe I'll just skip ahead. Oh no, I'm already caught up first to finish the sight wins TS first rest. Drama coverage is also drama. Okay.

13:36:58
zxshan: @GlamShatterskull correct

13:37:01
<transcript>: I need to know what hobbies Adam was talking about in those tweets. Let me find out. He's a part of the local yarn club.

13:37:01
<transcript>: what okay here

13:37:04
<transcript>: What? Okay. Here we go. My take.

13:37:04
<transcript>: my

13:37:06
zxshan: agree with everything you've said

13:37:11
lukeyfam15: Hi Adam

13:37:15
<transcript>: My take is, Did I mention that I love all these people? Literally. Every person on this page is someone that I hold in high regard, not just like, oh, yeah, they're okay.

13:37:17
<transcript>: I really do respect them.

13:37:26
gitpush_gitpaid: trav gave me a sub. theo blocked me. im team strager and trav. #stravvy

13:37:33
thdxr: adam "the guidance counselor" elmore

13:37:37
<transcript>: And they've all had moments where I've gotten to watch them on stream. We got to spend time around them on Twitter enough to really respect them. So it's possible for two things to be true. It's possible for me to respect all these people greatly and to still have an opinion about, like, I probably side with this person in this situation. So giving the prima Gen the benefit of it out here.

13:37:37
<transcript>: which

13:37:43
<transcript>: Which I'm not sure Straeger is because I don't know if Straeger knows prime. You know what I mean.

13:37:47
thdxr: theo blocked you lol why?

13:37:54
glamshatterskull: prime made a youtube video as well

13:37:57
<transcript>: I feel like prime in his tweets. Sometimes if that were your exposure to prime. And I'm sure Strager's caught a prime stream. Maybe not. I don't know. He streams in like the middle of the night. Strigger does. Maybe he's like an owl. And he's a wake at night. I don't know. But if you've.

13:37:57
<transcript>: really

13:38:04
<transcript>: Really gotten to no primer. Watched enough of prime, you know that he's like genuinely a very good human.

13:38:07
madlep: Sometimes I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt everyone just get along?‚Äù And then I remember some people like smooth peanut butter, and screw those weirdos

13:38:09
<transcript>: And I just give him the benefit out on pretty much anything because.

13:38:13
thdxr: wow adam called strager an owl....burn

13:38:23
lukeyfam15: cheer50

13:38:29
<transcript>: I genuinely believe he's a really good human. I don't know if streger knows that or if he thinks that he's a good human. But I feel like maybe Straeger has gotten another impression of prime, which is like clickbaity fear mongering. And I know some people believe that about prime, especially people who mostly consume his tweets. And they don't understand the context of prime through the lens of.

13:38:35
<transcript>: Like, you know what I'm saying? Does that make sense? So what I think here is.

13:38:44
<transcript>: I think it's good for people like prime with a huge audience to voice their concerns over something like this because it does actually lead to change.

13:38:52
thdxr: I've seen prime go crazy out of his way to help people who aren't even asking for help

13:38:55
<transcript>: So in that sense, I think I side with prime here. And I think trav, too, because I think trav is fighting with prime. Not that we have to take sides. But I do think in this situation.

13:38:55
<transcript>: it's good

13:38:57
glamshatterskull: primes yt vid is title "rust foundation IS DIONG WHAT?????" LUL LUL

13:39:03
thdxr: so I generally don't question his intentions

13:39:04
<transcript>: It's good for prime to throw a fit into. I don't know if he's I don't think prime is intentionally trying to instill fear in anybody. Like I just don't believe that he is.

13:39:04
<transcript>: i do think

13:39:05
gitpush_gitpaid: @thdxr he got salty i said he was wrong for saying showing the whole react doc was "his content" and if he thinks that he should upload a marvel movie on youtube and see how that turns out.

13:39:06
<transcript>: I do think he lets.

13:39:06
<transcript>: the people

13:39:17
<transcript>: The people who follow him know what he thinks. And I think that's good. I think it promotes change. If there's change that needs to be had people like prime using their audience for that. I think it's good.

13:39:17
<transcript>: i'm generally

13:39:17
thdxr: loool

13:39:19
<transcript>: I'm generally in favor of that.

13:39:19
<transcript>: but

13:39:20
glamshatterskull: it's like textbook clickbait

13:39:21
zxshan: It would be if they didn't also have a financial interest in it too. Strager's correct in the sense if you were genunely concerned you'd reach out directly before lighting signal fires

13:39:26
<transcript>: But I still love Straeger like I do. I love Straeger. Nothing about this situation makes me love Strigger any less.

13:39:26
<transcript>: i actually

13:39:32
<transcript>: I actually think it's hilarious that he just did this emoji tweet just because I can picture him on stream.

13:39:37
<transcript>: I don't know that's it that's my take.

13:39:42
zxshan: I would be good for Prime to make the video if... ** ^

13:39:42
<transcript>: Let's see. Wow. Adam called straeger an owl burn. Come on.

13:40:01
thdxr: My issue with saying "you're creating fear" is the underlying thing of "I'm smart enough to not get scared but other people are too dumb for the nuance"

13:40:03
<transcript>: Adam, the guidance counselor. Elmer. That's right. Trav gave me a sub, then theo blocked me. I'm team shraeger and Trav stravy. I don't know that they're on the same side of this argument. Necessarily. I think Trav is plus wanting. Well, I don't know. I can't really tell. It's hard. The internet's. Hard. Okay, most of us just know each other through words on a screen.

13:40:07
<transcript>: That's really hard to get communication down through words on the screen.

13:40:07
<transcript>: prime made

13:40:15
<transcript>: Prime made a YouTube video as well. Sometimes I'm like, Why can't everyone just get along? And then I remember some people, like, Smooth peanut Butter and screw those weirdos.

13:40:23
<transcript>: Luke fam. Thank you so much for the bits. Also, Wilsor hides. Thank you for the follow. I appreciate your follow.

13:40:23
<transcript>: let's

13:40:25
<transcript>: Let's see, cheers.

13:40:37
glamshatterskull: @thdxr uhhhh i don't think it says that at all.. smart people can be manipulated.

13:40:41
daglee: If rust goes to hell, we can create a language called Blender? With blackjack and h**kers?

13:40:41
<transcript>: 50 bits. Thank you so much, lukey. I've seen prime go crazy out of his way to help people who aren't even asking for help. So I generally don't question his intentions. Absolutely. Dax. I don't question prime's intentions. I think that's the thing. When I say he's a good human, I genuinely think.

13:40:44
<transcript>: Prime wants what's best.

13:40:44
<transcript>: and i think

13:40:51
gitpush_gitpaid: @thdxr like he ran over honeypot because he knew he could for engagement.

13:40:51
bishopdev: I genuinely don't really like any of them, Prime is sometime saying things as gospel when their wrong, Strager is genuinely mean sometimes and Theo ... just has a punchable face. I do like you adam .. in the Apocalypse I'll spare u

13:41:04
<transcript>: And I think he's a kind person. I think he has a persona that maybe sometimes some people take the wrong way and they get the wrong idea. But I think if you really watch prime enough, you are probably on Daxonite side of like, I just trust his intentions. I just trust that he's not going to make decisions for the wrong reasons, or he's not going to say things.

13:41:04
<transcript>: for the wrong

13:41:06
<transcript>: For the wrong reasons.

13:41:06
<transcript>: okay

13:41:07
<transcript>: Okay.

13:41:13
zxshan: @GlamShatterskull Yes

13:41:16
<transcript>: He got salty. I said he was wrong for saying certainly the whole reactal was his content, and he thinks that he should upload a Marvel movie on YouTube and see how that turns out.

13:41:17
nikolaxhristov: yeah, no, this just isn't right

13:41:18
<transcript>: I think I've heard that.

13:41:18
<transcript>: let's see

13:41:22
<transcript>: Let's see it's like textbook. Clickbait.

13:41:22
<transcript>: it would be

13:41:30
thdxr: @GlamShatterskull not saying they can't...I'm saying ultimately that's strager's point of view that "the sheep are panicing and they need to be protected"

13:41:35
<transcript>: It would be if they didn't also have a financial interest in it too. Streger is correct in the sense if you were genuinely concerned, you'd reach out directly before lighting signifiers. It would be good for prime to make the video if I got you.

13:41:35
<transcript>: my issue

13:41:36
coolpantstv: The issue is all of these people are streamers. Streams and drama are a match made in heaven

13:41:43
<transcript>: My issue with saying you're creating fear is the underlying thing of I'm smart enough to not get scared, but other people are too dumb for the nuance.

13:41:49
zxshan: @thdxr On the flip side, there's an assumption that people can decipher satire, trolling, misinformation -  we know from politics this isn't true

13:41:49
glamshatterskull: @thdxr you're putting words in his mouth.

13:41:49
thdxr: ultimately condescending

13:41:52
glamshatterskull: he didn't say that

13:42:00
<transcript>: If we say you're spreading fear, we're sort of like insulting the people who follow prime that they're not capable of holding two things in their head and not getting afraid that only sheep would be running in terror over somebody's words.

13:42:00
<transcript>: is that kind of what

13:42:02
thdxr: I know he didn't but that's the underlying thing it depends on

13:42:08
<transcript>: Is that kind of what you're saying? Dax, smart people can be manipulated. So glam says smart people can be manipulated. I agree with that, too.

13:42:09
<transcript>: Yeah.

13:42:09
<transcript>: if russ

13:42:10
thdxr: like prime's audience cannot handle a clickbait title

13:42:20
pbertrand_dev: i know some people that are spreading FEAR about VERCEL

13:42:20
thdxr: even if prime's view is extreme

13:42:20
nikolaxhristov: yeah if you know what's up you know what's up

13:42:21
pbertrand_dev: Kappa

13:42:24
<transcript>: If russ goes to hell, we can create a language called blender with blackjack and hooker. What exactly? What are you talking? I appreciate the comedic relief, dagley. I really do like he ran over Honeypot because he knew he could for engagement. What is honeypot.

13:42:24
<transcript>: honeypot oh

13:42:27
<transcript>: Honeypot. Oh, you're talking about theo. Let's see.

13:42:41
<transcript>: Bishop dev. I genuinely don't really like any of them. Prime is sometimes saying things as Gospel when they're wrong. Straegers genuinely mean sometimes and theo just has a punchable face. I do like you Adam in the apocalypse. I'll spare you.

13:42:43
daglee: You haven't seen the Blender meme from futurama?

13:42:46
zxshan: @GlamShatterskull Strawman's fallacy. That's not what strager is saying. It's not 100% this or that, fear is created by creating clickbait titles etc.

13:42:48
<transcript>: That was a roller coaster, of a thread, or of a message.

13:42:48
<transcript>: in the apocalypse

13:42:56
zxshan: @thdxr It's not jsut prime's audience though, it reached more

13:42:58
gitpush_gitpaid: see... theo damaged honeypot that much you dont even know who they are

13:42:59
<transcript>: In the apocalypse you'll spare me so in the apocalypse, Bishop, are you going around and eating people? What is happening? Where you're going to spare me in the apocalypse.

13:43:01
nikolaxhristov: @GlamShatterskull yup 100% strawman

13:43:04
thdxr: if you're quoting fallacy I'm not interested in talking to you

13:43:04
<transcript>: And what about the people you don't spare? What are you doing to them.

13:43:05
<transcript>: I need to understand.

13:43:08
<transcript>: That was funny.

13:43:08
<transcript>: no

13:43:10
<transcript>: No, this just isn't right.

13:43:13
bishopdev: @adamdotdev it's better that you don't know !!!

13:43:18
glamshatterskull: LUL

13:43:22
zxshan: lul

13:43:23
nikolaxhristov: what the Rust foundation did

13:43:26
zxshan: yikes

13:43:29
nikolaxhristov: they should've just put up a brand manual :D

13:43:30
<transcript>: What is it right, nico, I want to know your opinions, not saying they can't. I'm saying ultimately, that Streger's point of view that the sheep are panicking and they need to be protected. The issue is all these people are streamers. Streams and drama are a match made in heaven. Okay, so cool pants. I'm a streamer. I mean, I guess I stream. And you guys are here so clearly, I'm a streamer.

13:43:45
nikolaxhristov: like YouTube wouldn't sue if you made the logo green they would just be like, it's ugly :D

13:43:46
thdxr: I'm just saying strager's POV is condescending. I see this type of thing everywhere even outside of tech

13:43:48
<transcript>: What do people get at, like in software and dev? We get nothing out of it. Like it's literally just like for fun. There's no money involved in streaming. Now I don't know how much these people make on YouTube and wherever else. I don't really make money from content. It's a fun thing. I do. But I also just don't think anybody makes money from streaming.

13:43:48
<transcript>: do

13:43:55
<transcript>: Do they? That was not like a dig at what you said. It's just like a question or a clarification for me.

13:43:59
thdxr: if you're going to be like "that's a strawman fallancy" you're a nerd

13:44:03
4836276578235: gamers do lol

13:44:04
pbertrand_dev: I make money from moderation, surely you make money from streaming

13:44:08
glamshatterskull: i am fine with being a nerd

13:44:10
jokestera_e: ya I imagine Prime makes good money he gets like 2k views a stream

13:44:12
naxodev: you have marketing for your products

13:44:13
<transcript>: On the flip side, there's an assumption that people can decipher satire, trolling this information. We know from politics. That isn't true. Yeah, that's absolutely true. Zex shan, you're putting words in his mouth, ultimately condescending. He didn't say that. Listen, dax, glam. Hug it out. I love you both. You need to just.

13:44:13
agemonkey: devs might not make money, lots of others do.

13:44:20
coolpantstv: I think the actual act of streaming breeds drama, a bunch of public figures with followers that want to root for their streamer

13:44:23
ayushsharma: very little money from streaming

13:44:26
<transcript>: Stop. No, I'm just kidding. I don't know if you guys are working something out. That's fine. I know he didn't, but that's the underlying thing. It depends on, like, prime's audience cannot handle a clickbait title. I'm so behind again, aren't I.

13:44:32
<transcript>: Okay. I just need to start skimming.

13:44:34
silverlp: drama.rs

13:44:36
gitpush_gitpaid: @BishopDev i think strager is mean because he is super blunt and no filter. like yea he comes off like a dick but dude offers help to everyone that comes in.

13:44:37
<transcript>: Fear about versailles. Bertrand coming in with the troll. That was good.

13:44:40
<transcript>: If you know what's up you know what's up.

13:44:40
<transcript>: you haven't seen the

13:44:42
silverlp: oh god what did i link

13:44:45
<transcript>: You haven't seen the blender? Meme from futurama. Oh, I haven't dagly. I have it.

13:44:53
<transcript>: It's not just primes audience, so it reach more C the O damage honey pot that much you don't even know who they are.

13:44:53
thdxr: anyway I don't even care about this why did I get sucked in!

13:44:58
zxshan: Aren't we all nerds here @thdxr

13:44:58
thdxr: sorry @GlamShatterskull

13:44:58
pbertrand_dev: @thdxr Thats an Argumentum ad hominem

13:44:59
<transcript>: If you're quoting Fallacy, I'm not interested in talking to you. What is Fallacy quoting fallacy.

13:45:02
<transcript>: Did I quote fallacy.

13:45:07
zxshan: <3

13:45:10
<transcript>: It's better that you don't know? Oh, boy, Bishop, watch out for Bishop in the apocalypse, everybody? What the rust foundation did.

13:45:10
<transcript>: they should

13:45:13
bishopdev: :D

13:45:18
<transcript>: They should have just put up a brand manual like YouTube wouldn't sue if you made the logo green, they would just be like, it's ugly.

13:45:18
<transcript>: i'm just saying

13:45:24
thdxr: there's the good kinda nerd and the bad kinda nerd

13:45:27
<transcript>: I'm just saying shaker's point of view is condescending. I see this type of thing everywhere, even outside of Tech. If you're going to be like that's a straw man fallacy. You're a nerd.

13:45:28
glamshatterskull: @pbertrand_dev LUL

13:45:31
<transcript>: Gamers, do, gamers, do what.

13:45:36
bishopdev: I hope this doesn't come up as some madman with a gun kinda thing. If you're listening FBI 'I AM ONLY JOKING'

13:45:51
<transcript>: I make money for moderation. Oh, gamers make money on streaming. Yeah, I make money for moderation. Surely you make money from streaming. I mean, Pvertrand. It's on the order of like a few hundred dollars a month, which I donate by the way, to not for profits that promote diversity in tech because of my white guilt. Let's see, I'm fine with being a nerd.

13:45:51
<transcript>: i should probably start

13:46:04
nikolaxhristov: I heard white "build"

13:46:07
zxshan: @thdxr Subjective?

13:46:10
<transcript>: I should probably start saying that I'm just trolling when I say I have white guilt. I don't even honestly know what white guilt is. Dax just said something about it one day, and now I'm just like, I'm white. Sometimes I feel guilty about things. So I guess I have white guilt. I am fine with being a nerd. Yeah. I imagine prime makes good money. He gets like 2000 views a stream.

13:46:10
<transcript>: naxo welcome

13:46:10
nikolaxhristov: and now I'm like my build white xD

13:46:10
levidayne: Thats very nice of you, youre a good guy @adamdotdev

13:46:12
zxshan: lol

13:46:17
thdxr: Adam doesn't even know what white guilt is because he is racist

13:46:20

13:46:35
<transcript>: Do you ask a question about sports on Google? Wow, we're not top. Oh, Geez.

13:46:35

13:46:45
pbertrand_dev: white guild?

13:46:49
<transcript>: We're, like, barely in the middle of the page. We're one or two on most stats questions. So who has the most interceptions? Like most stats questions. You'll see us. Oh, wow. Are we losing our juice? Oh, no.

<transcript>: In a season.

13:46:57
glamshatterskull: i think everyone should take a marketing 101 class. especially everyone that creates content.

13:47:05
<transcript>: We number one on anything anymore. Okay, we're number one on that one. Well, we get like a million inbounds from Google every single day. So we're doing pretty well on SEO.

13:47:05

jokestera_e: That are a lot of open tabes

13:47:16
<transcript>: Should I get back to it? Should I actually start working now? Drama Rs Very little money from streaming.

13:47:18
thdxr: we are pushing the BOUNDARIES on marketing

13:47:24
<transcript>: Devs might not make money. Lots of others do. I think the actual act of streaming breeds drama. A bunch of public figures with followers that want to root for their streamer.

13:47:24
<transcript>: do you guys

13:47:39
<transcript>: Do you guys feel like that? I mean, you guys hang out with me a lot. Do you feel like you're going to root for me if I get in an argument? First of all, I won't get in an argument because it's against the fiber, every fiber of my being. I am a type nine enneagram. I cannot handle conflict.

13:47:39

zxshan: Adam stole my lunch money

13:48:32
<transcript>: Anti. They're like your opposite, and they say something on the internet, and you just don't like them immediately. So that's happened a couple of times, but for the most part, I avoid conflict. So you guys won't have to choose between me and somebody else because I won't be in a lot of arguments. It's a typescript foundation comes out and says you can't make typescript courses or use the typescript log.

13:49:02
<transcript>: Are we done with this one? I think Shreger is mean because he is super blunt and no filter like, yeah, he comes off like a Dick, but dude offers to help everyone that comes in. You think he is mean though.

13:49:08
<transcript>: I think Straeger has no filter. And he is super blunt. I actually love that.

13:49:08
<transcript>: because

13:49:14
<transcript>: Because I envy it so much I wish I could be like Strager. Strager is like the opposite of me in the best way.

13:49:22
smilingbig: yeah his bluntness is so great

13:49:34
<transcript>: I really, genuinely wish I could just speak my mind and I'm mostly can't because I fear anyone having any problems with me and being on a different page. If someone's upset with me, I lose sleep over it. Okay anyway, I don't even care about this. Why did I get sucked in? Why did you get sucked indexed? You apparently must care, aren't we all.

13:50:09
<transcript>: Hope this doesn't come up as some madman with a gun kind of thing. If you're listening. Fbi, I'm only joking. Bishop was just joking. There's no apocalypse coming. And if there were, Bishop is on the up and up. Okay, Adam, you get into twitch fights more than me. Oh, Twitter fights. Oh, I probably do. We are pushing the boundaries on marketing.

kubahasek: just do some coding, we all like that collectively eh?

13:51:18
<transcript>: Straeger's button. This is usually rooted in some form of objectivity. Yeah, I feel like streger is pretty objective. Doesn't mean he can't misunderstand somebody.

13:51:21
<transcript>: Or have a conversation.

13:51:24
<transcript>: That we would have had differently, but.

13:51:24
<transcript>: again love

13:51:33
<transcript>: Again love all these people. I give them all the benefit of the doubt. Okay, here we go. We're going to close this one. This really comes down to some people don't like prime, and some people don't like traeger. I think you're right.

13:51:37
<transcript>: I also like both of them, so I'm just siding with the person being criticized.

13:51:46
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah. Let's do some coding. I think we're done with Twitter time. This is too much. If you're replying to my tweet to disagree, you probably missed the point.

13:54:48
<transcript>: Not like it would have been better if it was more realistic. It just would have been better if it wasn't so many. He just layered in too many stereotypes. I don't know.

13:59:53
<transcript>: Okay.

13:59:54
kubahasek: @kubahasek I've heard someone say that, but I guess I don't understand it that much

13:59:55
<transcript>: No.

14:00:01
sabxf: comfy indeed, sound depends on impedance, budget and taste (in no order)

14:00:02
<transcript>: Is it? Yeah. Shift, though. There we go. Okay.

14:00:06
bodhihawken: also i always import stripe from my own file so its already got the key loaded

14:00:06
silverlp: no reasons to use beyers nowadays imo

14:00:08
<transcript>: Wow, I'm really struggling right now. Why am I struggling so much.

14:00:08
<transcript>: okay

14:00:09
<transcript>: Okay.

14:00:09
<transcript>: yank

14:00:10
<transcript>: Yank.

14:00:10
<transcript>: y

14:00:14
<transcript>: Yank, Why can't I type or do anything for.

14:00:18
<transcript>: You guys have broken me. You've broken my brain.

14:00:18
<transcript>: import

14:00:20
<transcript>: Import.

14:00:20
<transcript>: strive

14:00:21
<transcript>: Strive.

14:00:21
<transcript>: from

14:00:23
<transcript>: From stripe.

14:00:29
<transcript>: Oh, do I need to.

14:00:31
pbertrand_dev: I'm 85% sure it was already broken when I got here

14:00:40
cowfacedev: 'are you sure you use neovim????' LUL

14:00:42
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow.

14:00:46
<transcript>: What do you guys talk about? Sab? Welcome to chat.

14:00:46
<transcript>: anyone who's

14:00:50
sabxf: \o/

14:00:52
cowfacedev: maybe time to go back to vs****.....

14:00:53
<transcript>: Anyone who's bare Dynamics. You guys saw my headphones. I can't think about headphones right now. Heard someone say that. But I guess I don't understand that much.

14:00:55
<transcript>: Headphones, headphones.

14:00:55
<transcript>: always

14:00:57
kubahasek: @SilverLP which would you recommend for a lossless beginner then?

14:00:59
<transcript>: Always import stripe from my own file so it's already got the key loaded.

14:00:59
<transcript>: that's a good

14:01:01
<transcript>: That's a good idea. Bodie.

14:01:06
<transcript>: No reason to use Bears. Okay, I'm 85% sure it was already broken when I got here.

14:01:06
<transcript>: are you

14:01:13
silverlp: @SilverLP we should prob go to dms rly quick else we spam this chat

14:01:16
<transcript>: Are you sure you use neo vim? Ouch cafes? That one hit me. That cut me deep. Maybe time to go back to vsco. Stop it. Stop it. I'm not that bad.

14:01:18
<transcript>: I'm pretty bad.

14:01:18
<transcript>: so

14:01:19
bodhihawken: maybe checkout pricing table?

14:01:20
<transcript>: So Import stripe.

14:01:24
<transcript>: So I should just have my own file. You're saying.

14:01:27
studiojvla: @bodhihawken i guess that's like a singleton?

14:01:32
<transcript>: Like stripe ps. And then I can. Oh, you sent me an example. Let's do this. Let's go, fuzzy.

14:01:32
<transcript>: you sent

14:01:34
studiojvla: one instance you always refer to

14:01:36
<transcript>: You sent me an example, and I'm going to open it.

14:01:39
<transcript>: What did you send me.

14:01:43
sabxf: adamdotdevception

14:01:43
kubahasek: @SilverLP yeah i am down, discord?

14:01:46
<transcript>: Whoa. That's a link right there. That is a link right there.

14:01:50
<transcript>: Okay. What we got here.

14:01:54
<transcript>: I guess I should turn off fuzzy.

14:02:00
<transcript>: Let me copy this link. Over here.

14:02:09
<transcript>: Turn off that.

14:02:11
<transcript>: Stripe.

14:02:11
<transcript>: pricing

14:02:14
<transcript>: Pricing Table okay.

14:02:14
<transcript>: and then

14:02:16
silverlp: @SilverLP sure Silvan#6969

14:02:16
jokestera_e: i was a fan of Beyers COP they were my first real headphones. Now I got the HD 6XXs and Fiio FH5s and i've been very happy with both

14:02:16
<transcript>: And then server side checkout completed.

14:02:17
bodhihawken: this how i import stripe import Stripe from "stripe"; export const stripe = new Stripe(   process.env.STRIPEKEY     ? process.env.STRIPEKEY     : "sk_test_",   { apiVersion: "2022-11-15" Ä˝,} );Ä˝,

14:02:19
sockthedev: the worst thing about neovim is that it is physically painful pairing with a developer using a gui based ide. the mouse pushing and tedious text navigation kills me.

14:02:20
<transcript>: Find, user.

14:02:23
<transcript>: Stripe portal.

14:02:23
<transcript>: git billing

14:02:24
<transcript>: Git, billing.

14:02:26
<transcript>: Okay.

14:02:30
<transcript>: So this is helpful.

14:02:31
sockthedev: i almost regret switching

14:02:32
sabxf: @jokesterA_E HD600/650 are great :)

14:02:39
<transcript>: This is how to use the pricing table though I think I am going to build the full checkout thing just because I have a lot more experience with it.

14:02:44
<transcript>: Let's see. We should probably go to dms really quick, lc, Span, the chat.

14:02:49
<transcript>: Adam dev section.

14:02:54
jokestera_e: Beyers DT series is still really good for anyone

14:03:01
<transcript>: This is how I import stripe. Import stripe from stripe. Export. Comp. Stripe. Equal new stripe. Oh, yeah. Capital? S. Good call. That's the problem.

14:03:01
<transcript>: so now we can

14:03:05
<transcript>: So now we can do Const stripe equals new stripe.

14:03:05
<transcript>: process

14:03:11
<transcript>: Process INF actually I can use config. I can use sst config here. Import.

14:03:11
<transcript>: config

14:03:13
jokestera_e: Senns are just so comfy

14:03:14
<transcript>: Config from SST.

14:03:16
<transcript>: What.

14:03:18
<transcript>: Is that right.

14:03:21
thdxr: Liz is coming home today THANK THE LORD

14:03:23
<transcript>: I have so many questions. Thanks. One of my questions is.

14:03:25
<transcript>: Why.

14:03:26
silverlp: beyers give me a headache on certain voice pitches

14:03:29
<transcript>: Is my prettier. Not good.

14:03:36
<transcript>: Prettier.

14:03:40
<transcript>: Some of you are going to get upset.

14:03:45
<transcript>: Some of you, I guarantee you are going to get upset because of what I'm about to do.

14:03:46
kubahasek: jeez this dm should be a group chat at this point

14:03:49
<transcript>: Am I false the only way.

14:03:49
<transcript>: this

14:03:56
<transcript>: This is the only way. I'm sorry if you disagree. You're wrong. It's okay. Everyone's wrong about something.

14:04:00
<transcript>: Is it even? Is it even working now? I don't think so.

14:04:00
<transcript>: we got

14:04:02
<transcript>: We got to do it in here.

14:04:06
wallyg10: why it hard to setup neovim on windows

14:04:09
<transcript>: How does it do that.

14:04:13
<transcript>: Copilot doing that semi.

14:04:13
<transcript>: false

14:04:13
traylortrash84: I agree

14:04:14
<transcript>: False.

14:04:22
<transcript>: Feels good. Feels good. Feels good. Wait. Wow. Why is it video not working.

14:04:27
<transcript>: Is this working? Okay, cool.

14:04:27
<transcript>: you agree

14:04:30
greetten: Is it worth using neovim while learning java?

14:04:31
<transcript>: You agree? Good. I'm glad we all agree.

14:04:33
<transcript>: The worst.

14:04:33
<transcript>: thing about

14:04:38
greetten: it seems everyone uses it

14:04:42
<transcript>: Thing about Neovim is that it is physically painful pairing with the developer using a gui based ide, the mouth pushing and tedious nascent navigation I almost forget switching.

14:04:48
<transcript>: Liz is coming home today. Oh, good, dex. You're going to have your normal schedule now.

14:04:51
<transcript>: Who.

14:04:52
jokestera_e: @Greetten There is nothing wrong with it but you can't go wrong with intellij.

14:04:53
bodhihawken: even if your using checkout definetly use StripePortal. super easy!

14:04:58
<transcript>: Does my back hurt so much? Is it worth using Neil vim? While learning java it seems everyone uses it.

14:05:04
<transcript>: I mean, I think I've heard java has, like a really good ide, right. Intellij. There it is.

14:05:11
<transcript>: Yeah, I would maybe just do like stripe or do stripe do vim bindings and intellij maybe to start.

14:05:11
<transcript>: okay

14:05:17
<transcript>: Okay. So config is SST config. And now I can do stripe.

14:05:21
<transcript>: I can do like what.

14:05:24
<transcript>: Config.

14:05:25
<transcript>: configret

14:05:26
<transcript>: Configret.

14:05:28
greetten: i use intellij right now, but dont mind trying new things

14:05:30
bodhihawken: also these are the webhooks i usually setup!

14:05:31
<transcript>: I don't remember. I guess I have to define the secret first. Don't I.

14:05:32
bodhihawken: //checkout.session.completed  //customer.subscription.deleted  //customer.subscription.updated  //invoice.finalization_failed

14:05:35
sockthedev: honestly, if you are considering switching to neovim. honest story. it'll take a couple of months till you are properly fluid in it

14:05:36
<transcript>: 'm just going to call this.

14:05:41
sockthedev: at least took me that long

14:05:42
uberrick: @sockthedev I find this is also the opposite, some devs I pair with who use VSC find it hard to follow when I'm moving around in neovim especially with rel line numbers haha

14:05:43
<transcript>: I could do one for stripes, specifically, a stripe stack.

14:05:47
achour2011: are you coding StatMuse ?

14:05:50
<transcript>: We'll call it stripe, stack.

14:05:50
<transcript>: str

14:05:52
<transcript>: Stripe.

14:05:54
<transcript>: Let's see.

14:05:54
<transcript>: new

14:05:54
thdxr: he's trying

14:06:01
<transcript>: New api. We're going to have an api. We're going to have secrets. How do I add secrets? I have so many questions.

14:06:01
<transcript>: zach

14:06:02
<transcript>: Zach.

14:06:09
<transcript>: Hr first message. Welcome to Chat. Are you coding statues? Yes, I'm trying. I get a little distracted.

14:06:09
<transcript>: but

14:06:15
<transcript>: But we are working on Stabbies.com. We're adding some pricing.

14:06:15
<transcript>: we're making

14:06:17
thdxr: @adamdotdev you should just make a single api not one just for stripe

14:06:20
sockthedev: @sockthedev no sympathy for the peasants

14:06:24
<transcript>: We're making a paywall. I'm sorry if you're a satin's user, we're adding a paywall if you do a bunch of queries. So that's what we're doing right now.

14:06:27
<transcript>: Let's see.

14:06:30
thdxr: can always add routes from different stacks to a central api

14:06:34
<transcript>: You should just make a single api, not one just for stripe. Oh, yeah. No, you're right. The api should be part of, like, an api stack or something.

14:06:45
<transcript>: But should there be like a stripe package or a stripe stack just for all the other stripe stuff? No, I guess not. Maybe it's all just in the api. Let's call it api stack.

14:06:47
<transcript>: What I want to rename it.

14:06:50
<transcript>: Call it API.

14:06:52
<transcript>: Stack.

14:06:53
thdxr: yeah

14:07:00
<transcript>: Next. How do I do secrets. I should just know these things.

14:07:02
cowfacedev: @Greetten java is a pain for neovim. I had used it about a year ago with the java plugin, and it worked for me but ymmv. although if you are learning, you should stick with intellij and move to neovim only if you are able to put in the time. personal opition though.

14:07:02
<transcript>: Always add.

14:07:06
vapor__dev: `npx sst secrets <command> [options]`

14:07:09
<transcript>: Can always add routes from different stacks to Central API.

14:07:14
achour2011: question :  is it good idea to code you Idea in stream or youtube videos ?

14:07:18
<transcript>: Thank you. Wait. Does that add a secret, though? Alan, I want to add it to the stack. I haven't defined it yet.

14:07:25
<transcript>: Like Stack or this app, isn't it? I have to do it up here.

14:07:27
thdxr: new Config.Secret(stack, "MY_SECRET")

14:07:29
<transcript>: App.

14:07:32
<transcript>: Secrets add.

14:07:32
<transcript>: sec

14:07:34
<transcript>: Secret.

14:07:34
<transcript>: oh

14:07:36
<transcript>: Oh new.

14:07:36
<transcript>: config

14:07:37
<transcript>: Config.

14:07:42
<transcript>: Secret OOH feels good.

14:07:42
<transcript>: stack

14:07:43
vapor__dev: Config.Secret.createe

14:07:43
<transcript>: Stack.

14:07:45
thdxr: secret is a construct

14:07:46
<transcript>: And then stripe.

14:07:57
<transcript>: Config secret create what's the difference.

14:08:02
<transcript>: Is it a good idea to code.

14:08:02
<transcript>: uida in

14:08:06
<transcript>: Uida in Stream or YouTube videos? What do you mean by that.

14:08:06
<transcript>: is it a good idea

14:08:06
thdxr: bind it to the api so things can read it

14:08:10
<transcript>: Is it a good idea to code your idea in stream or YouTube videos.

14:08:13
thdxr: COnfig.Secret.create lets you make multiple

14:08:14
<transcript>: Bind it to the api so things can read it.

14:08:14
<transcript>: how do i

14:08:18
<transcript>: How do I bind it to the api? Oh, right.

14:08:18
<transcript>: find

14:08:18
greatgrievance: developing in public can be a good strategy

14:08:19
<transcript>: Find.

<transcript>: No sympathy for the peasants.

14:08:26

14:08:26

thdxr: good thing alan is here

14:08:43
uberrick: @sockthedev LUL

14:08:44
<transcript>: Is there something wrong with mode.

14:08:50
<transcript>: Save changes? Yes.

14:08:53
<transcript>: Exact shall.

14:08:53
<transcript>: is there something wrong

14:08:57
<transcript>: Is there something wrong with node? I think there's something wrong with node.

14:09:05
<transcript>: Come on, come on, come on, come on? What is going on.

14:09:11
<transcript>: Is there no prettier at the root? Oh, maybe there's no prettier. Oh, there's just no prettier.

14:09:14
greetten: @cowFaceDev gotcha, thanks

14:09:16
<transcript>: I don't know why I thought there was prettier in the package by default or something. I don't know.

14:09:16
<transcript>: pmp

14:09:19
<transcript>: Pmpm, ad.

14:09:38
thdxr: `-w`

14:09:38
vapor__dev: @thdxr thx!

14:09:41
<transcript>: Unless you make multiple gotcha what's wrong here unexpected token.

14:09:45
jokestera_e: @Greetten This is a good take. Neovim is really for those that can code and want a better workflow.

14:09:46
<transcript>: Oh, did I mess up the oh, I messed up the.

14:09:48
vapor__dev: `-w`

14:09:48

14:10:17
<transcript>: like

14:10:21
thdxr: yeah alan why?

<transcript>: We need to in this function. We're going to do this.

14:21:40
m2devdotnet: Add a reward redemption for stretching / posture.

14:21:43
<transcript>: Basically all this stuff.

14:21:43
<transcript>: then

14:21:44
dmdboi: Its on my Rock playlist

14:21:47
<transcript>: Then we redirect the session URL.

14:21:53
dmdboi: and the Queen Live at Wembley CD just arrived in the post

14:21:55
<transcript>: How do I do a redirect? I don't know how to do a redirect.

14:21:58
<transcript>: In Lambda function you can't.

14:21:58
<transcript>: who's going to return

14:22:01
<transcript>: Who's going to return the URL and we're going to have to redirect.

14:22:06
<transcript>: Right. Yeah. I can't redirect from here. Can I.

14:22:06
<transcript>: wait

14:22:10
<transcript>: Wait. Can I. Why is that not obvious to me right now.

14:22:12
<transcript>: If you make a request.

14:22:17
<transcript>: It's to api Gateway, I guess. Yeah, I could do a redirect.

14:22:17
<transcript>: right

14:22:20
<transcript>: Right I could just do.

14:22:20
<transcript>: like

14:22:22
<transcript>: Like status code.

14:22:25
<transcript>: 303.

14:22:28
<transcript>: What would the body be, though.

14:22:30
<transcript>: Redirect.

14:22:33
<transcript>: How would I do a redirect.

14:22:39
<transcript>: Lambda function.

14:22:39
<transcript>: redirect

14:22:40
penairdes: Location

14:22:40

14:23:02
<transcript>: The location is going to be session URL.

14:23:02
<transcript>: so

14:23:05
<transcript>: So let's do.

14:23:07
<transcript>: Wait. Why.

14:23:18
<transcript>: Session. Url. Sorry my brain just exploded for a second.

14:23:18
<transcript>: because

14:23:19
<transcript>: Because.

14:23:19
<transcript>: these are

14:23:23
<transcript>: These are the redirect urls. So your domain.

14:23:29
<transcript>: That's true. So you have to provide success URLs and cancel URLs.

14:23:36
<transcript>: That's what stripe will redirect to from the checkout page.

14:23:38
<transcript>: Okay.

14:23:47
<transcript>: That's crazy Diamond.

14:23:52
<transcript>: Add a reward for stretching, posture.

14:23:52
<transcript>: i would never notice

14:23:56
<transcript>: I would never notice because I would just assume people are doing the MacBook redeem.

14:24:05
<transcript>: Okay. We need to create a price or a product, I guess first and then a price.

14:24:07
<transcript>: In here.

14:24:11
<transcript>: We're not doing payment links.

14:24:13

<transcript>: Turn status code 500. Yeah, I don't know what to do. And that's it in that situation.

14:27:53
<transcript>: Body something. Yeah. Fail to create checkout session. Sure. Okay. So that solves that.

14:27:59
<transcript>: Don't have to have a body that felt wrong. What's a 303? What's a 303 status code.

14:28:04
saltyohm: Good morning!  Hope you‚Äôre doing well

14:28:05
<transcript>: Rule One is permanent. 302 is temporary. Redirect. What's? 303.

14:28:07
gitpush_gitpaid: its a band

14:28:10
<transcript>: Stza. Thank you for the follow.

14:28:12
<transcript>: It's a band.

14:28:15
stronkbad: loss of internet maybe

14:28:17
<transcript>: Wait. That overhead shot is real. What's the overhead shot.

14:28:17
<transcript>: you mean

14:28:19
<transcript>: You mean my the moving camera.

14:28:21
nikolaxhristov: See Other says internet

14:28:22
<transcript>: It is real. It's real time.

14:28:22
<transcript>: it's just another

14:28:28
vapor__dev: 303 is see other

14:28:35
<transcript>: It's just another scene in my I'll show you there's scene in my obs. I've just got a camera on a jib right there and it's moving around. It's just on a loop, constantly moving around.

14:28:35
<transcript>: so you can see me

14:28:37
<transcript>: So you can see me eat my oatmeal.

14:28:40
<transcript>: You never know when somebody wants to watch me eat my oatmeal.

14:28:52
<transcript>: That's what that is. 303 is C ever.

14:28:52
<transcript>: okay

14:28:53
vapor__dev: the response to the request is at another URI

14:28:53
<transcript>: Okay.

14:28:56
<transcript>: What's the other mean.

14:28:59
<transcript>: Okay.

14:29:03
<transcript>: Why did I put that right there.

14:29:06
sasankthapa: do you start working on the computer as soon as you get up?

14:29:08
<transcript>: Not using time. We're getting there. We're getting somewhere. I got to set the secret value.

14:29:14
sptremblay: This response code is often sent back as a result of PUT or POST. The method used to display this redirected page is always GET.

14:29:15
<transcript>: We're not even using the event. I'm going to need to use the event.

14:29:17
<transcript>: Because.

14:29:17
<transcript>: we're going to

14:29:19
<transcript>: We're going to pass.

14:29:27
<transcript>: The well, I guess not yet. I will need to because we're going to pass the price or something that.

14:29:30
gitpush_gitpaid: bro wtf is this. i thought it was like some filler video. dude got a whole production. i see you Scorsese

14:29:40
<transcript>: Tells you what they're buying because maybe we'll have multiple options. They'll have to be able to pass. Like, I want to subscribe to this version and then we'll have to look up the price ID. Probably in the environment. Right. I guess I should go ahead and do that.

14:29:44
<transcript>: Let's get this from config.

14:29:46
<transcript>: Put our stack.

14:29:49
<transcript>: Let's do config.

14:29:51
<transcript>: Secret.

14:29:51
<transcript>: new

14:29:52
<transcript>: New.

14:29:57
<transcript>: Big secret.

14:29:59
<transcript>: What.

14:30:04
<transcript>: Alan, what is it? Secret.

14:30:07
<transcript>: Create.

14:30:07
<transcript>: i

14:30:10
<transcript>: I can do multiple in here.

14:30:11
<transcript>: All right.

14:30:15
vapor__dev: yeah

14:30:15
<transcript>: Contract.

14:30:17
<transcript>: What.

14:30:21
<transcript>: Criti thank you for the follow.

14:30:21
<transcript>: yeah

14:30:22
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:30:22
<transcript>: i thought

14:30:29
<transcript>: I thought it was like some filler. Video. Got a whole production. It's a whole production. Turk.

14:30:32
<transcript>: There's a lot going on in here.

14:30:32
<transcript>: to drive

14:30:33
vapor__dev: first argument is stack, then can add as many secrets as you want

14:30:34
<transcript>: To drive this kind of stream quality.

14:30:50
<transcript>: The response to the request is that another uri. Okay. Do you start working on the computer as soon as you get up? I do sassan, I have a problem where it's very hard for me to have other habits. I'm very excited when I wake up to get to work and I come down here and I sat down as soon as I wake up.

14:30:50
<transcript>: so it's

14:30:54
vapor__dev: Config.Secret.create(ctx.stack, secret1, secret2,...)

14:30:57
<transcript>: So it's always been hard for me to get into, like, a workout habit where I work out. Before I work, I usually take a break in the middle of the day, and I go.

14:30:57
<transcript>: for a walk

14:30:59
<transcript>: For a walk or something.

14:30:59
<transcript>: but

14:31:04
<transcript>: But I do. I just wake up and I go to work. Response code is often sent back to okay.

14:31:04
<transcript>: first

14:31:09
<transcript>: First argument is stack, and then can add as many secrets as you want. Cool.

14:31:12
<transcript>: So stack and then.

14:31:16
<transcript>: What is the shape of the secret look like.

14:31:20
<transcript>: What is this? Like an array.

14:31:20
<transcript>: like

14:31:21
<transcript>: Like this.

14:31:25
<transcript>: No.

14:31:28
vapor__dev: no arugments

14:31:28
<transcript>: Like this.

14:31:30
<transcript>: Right.

14:31:33
<transcript>: No arguments.

14:31:37
<transcript>: Yeah, just like this.

14:31:41
<transcript>: Stripe secret stripe price.

14:31:42
sasankthapa: I guess I need to start doing that.... its so difficult to wake up if I dont look at a screen in the morning tbh

14:31:43
<transcript>: Id.

14:31:48
gitpush_gitpaid: im going to put that i was a part of the team that implemented the subscription feature on statmuse

14:31:49
<transcript>: Doesn't need to be a secret. Is there something.

14:31:49
<transcript>: for non

14:31:50
<transcript>: For Non secrets.

14:31:50
<transcript>: parame

14:31:52
<transcript>: Parameter.

14:31:54
gitpush_gitpaid: on my resume

14:31:56
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah. These aren't sensitive, right.

14:32:06
goodgrandpaa: @gitpush_gitpaid Genius

14:32:08
<transcript>: I guess I need to start doing that. It's so difficult to wake up if I don't look at a screen in the morning. To be honest, I'm going to put that I was part of the team that implemented the subscription feature on sammy's on My rhythm.

14:32:08
<transcript>: that's

14:32:12
<transcript>: That's awesome. Finch. Untamed. Thank you so much for the follow.

14:32:15
<transcript>: Create stack.

14:32:15
<transcript>: stripe

14:32:15
vapor__dev: i just make them all secrets but i duno if thats what dax recomends

14:32:18
goodgrandpaa: I'm going to put "Friends with co-founder of Statmuse"

14:32:20
<transcript>: Stripe, Price ID if they're not sensitive, this is what I should do, right.

14:32:27
goodgrandpaa: Kappa

14:32:27
<transcript>: I just put the value in here right away.

14:32:27
<transcript>: but the value

14:32:30
<transcript>: But the value depends on.

14:32:32
<transcript>: The environment.

14:32:35
<transcript>: You know what I mean.

14:32:38
gitpush_gitpaid: im going to start screenshotting everything and say i wrote this code

14:32:40
<transcript>: You just make them all secrets. Yeah. I guess the question is.

14:32:44
<transcript>: I'm going to put friends with cofounder savvies. I love it you're all my friends.

14:32:53
goodgrandpaa: LUL

14:33:04
goodgrandpaa: "these are my hands, on my nice keyboard."

14:33:08
<transcript>: Yeah if I don't know the value yet.

14:33:14
<transcript>: I guess we'll just make it a secret. That's fine.

14:33:20
<transcript>: Stripe Price ID. I just know Secrets Manager is more expensive.

14:33:20
<transcript>: but

14:33:23
<transcript>: But it's not much. It's fine.

14:33:26
<transcript>: It also might be slower and have.

14:33:26
<transcript>: a stricter

14:33:27
<transcript>: A stricter quota but.

14:33:27
<transcript>: it's fine

14:33:29
<transcript>: It's fine.

14:33:30
vapor__dev: we all know you're rich

14:33:31
<transcript>: I'll have stacks later.

14:33:35
<transcript>: Yeah. Well, I'm rich. It's fine.

14:33:39
<transcript>: Okay.

14:33:42
<transcript>: Price is going.

14:33:42
<transcript>: to be

14:33:47
<transcript>: To be config stripe price ID just like that.

14:33:54
<transcript>: Field. Good. Okay now success. Url. I didn't know I had to put the actual. I thought it could be like a relative URL.

14:33:54
<transcript>: can it

14:33:55
supersnoopadoop: What keyboard switches are those?

14:33:56
<transcript>: Can it not.

14:34:01
<transcript>: Stripe check out.

14:34:04
<transcript>: Stripe check out relative.

14:34:16
nwikechisom: what's the font in your IDE?

14:34:16
goodgrandpaa: I liked your thoughts on the rust foundation this morning LUL

14:34:18
bubakek: ask chatgpt :D

14:34:25
<transcript>: Nick, welcome to Chat. The the font is Operator mono.

14:34:40
<transcript>: Is it return url a success URL.

14:34:51
<transcript>: I should go to the docs more often.

14:34:55
nwikechisom: thanks!

14:34:56
gitpush_gitpaid: @GoodGrandPaa what was his thoughts? i feel like all he said was he likes everyone and agrees with everyone

14:35:06
<transcript>: So I guess these have to be.

14:35:06
<transcript>: absolute ur

14:35:07
<transcript>: Absolute URLs.

14:35:11
goodgrandpaa: @gitpush_gitpaid He didn't say anything LUL

14:35:16
<transcript>: I like your thoughts on the rust foundation this morning. Oh, Yeah.

14:35:19
<transcript>: But I don't have thoughts.

14:35:25
<transcript>: I wish I did. I'm not trying to cop out. I just don't. I literally don't have any.

14:35:25
goodgrandpaa: Exactly

14:35:42
<transcript>: Okay. So next question is, how do I get the URL.

14:35:42
<transcript>: here

14:35:43
<transcript>: Here.

14:35:48
goodgrandpaa: @gitpush_gitpaid We must've watched a different video Kappa

14:35:50
gitpush_gitpaid: best way. stay mutual. that way when the twitch coding celebrity boxing event happens you can get front row seats

14:35:52
<transcript>: How do I get the url for an ssc app? I could really use dax right about now.

14:35:55
<transcript>: Okay. I bet he's on streaming right now.

14:35:59
gitpush_gitpaid: @GoodGrandPaa i didnt see it

14:35:59
<transcript>: Dax. He's not.

14:36:01
<transcript>: Well.

14:36:02
pbertrand_dev: cant you do this? I do this with PHP the lords langauge

14:36:03
pbertrand_dev: 'success_url' => 'https://example.com/success.php?customer_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}',

14:36:04
<transcript>: Bummer.

14:36:04
vapor__dev: i know

14:36:04
goodgrandpaa: @gitpush_gitpaid Oh gotcha!

14:36:06
<transcript>: Where is DAX.

14:36:09
<transcript>: Dax.

14:36:14
<transcript>: Dax is bad. Every time we make fun of dax, he shows up.

14:36:19
<transcript>: Success url Example Customer ID.

14:36:21
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:36:27
<transcript>: I want this to be like dynamic based on the environment and everything. So the URL here.

14:36:30
<transcript>: I don't want to just hard code like satmus.com.

14:36:30
<transcript>: something

14:36:34
<transcript>: Something success. It's got to be like my Dev environment.

14:36:38
<transcript>: Or in production. It'll be satmus.com. You know what I'm saying.

14:36:40
pbertrand_dev: Ah ok

14:36:50
<transcript>: I guess.

14:36:55
<transcript>: I guess right now.

14:36:58
<transcript>: I could.

14:37:01
<transcript>: Hard code. It I guess hate that.

14:37:04
gitpush_gitpaid: i think dax said he was getting his head shined for react miami

14:37:06
<transcript>: Just need to know in SST land I guess I should look it up.

14:37:13
<transcript>: Guess I should look it up.

14:37:13
pbertrand_dev: LMAO

14:37:14
goodgrandpaa: @gitpush_gitpaid ooooh very fancy

14:37:14
alistairdev: use the `use` statment and import the API

14:37:23
<transcript>: He's getting his head shine for React Miley.

14:37:26
<transcript>: Oh, man.

14:37:29
alistairdev: Then const api = use(Api)

14:37:30
<transcript>: Use the use statement and import the api. Can you do that.

14:37:33
<transcript>: At runtime.

14:37:36
<transcript>: Can I do that? Alice. There.

14:37:40
<transcript>: Let's see here. Ssc.

14:37:40
<transcript>: function

14:37:40
cowfacedev: couldn't you throw it in a secret?

14:37:41
<transcript>: Function.

14:37:43
alistairdev: Yup

14:37:44
<transcript>: Get domain.

14:37:46
cowfacedev: and than pick it up

14:37:56
<transcript>: You can do that. Okay, throw it in secret. I could Yak out face. It just feels so suboptimal.

14:38:07
<transcript>: Honestly, that feels worse than just hard coding it for now, until you get better answers. Amazing, davy. Amazing, davy. Thank you for that. Follow.

14:38:07
<transcript>: you're amazing

14:38:09
<transcript>: You're amazing. Okay.

14:38:09
<transcript>: so

14:38:11
<transcript>: So I can just use the user.

14:38:11
<transcript>: thing i can do

14:38:13
<transcript>: Thing I can do that at runtime.

14:38:17
<transcript>: Let's see.

14:38:21
<transcript>: So Const API equals use.

14:38:24
penairdes: Think use only work in stacks

14:38:25
<transcript>: Now.

14:38:34
<transcript>: Where do I import use? I was hoping to auto import it. Where do I import use from? Is it from just node import.

14:38:34
<transcript>: use

14:38:34
vapor__dev: adam import the client from node, then can do Api.myapi.url

14:38:35
<transcript>: Use.

14:38:35
<transcript>: from

14:38:38
<transcript>: From sstnode.

14:38:43
vapor__dev: "sst/node/api" client

14:38:46
<transcript>: No, surely not. I think that would only work in stacks. Yeah, that's what I would think. I would think. You couldn't do that in runtime. Right.

14:38:46
<transcript>: import

14:38:53
<transcript>: Import the client from node and then you can do API myapi URL.

14:38:55
thdxr: hi

14:38:57
alistairdev: Ah, sorry was only half listening

14:39:00
<transcript>: Oh, but it's not actually. Wait a minute. It's not actually the API url. Oh, my bad. No, this is.

14:39:01
thdxr: what are you lookin for

14:39:06
<transcript>: I'm going to have to do this with a secret or with some environment variable or something because.

14:39:06
<transcript>: it's actually the

14:39:09
<transcript>: It's actually the Status Web app.

14:39:09
<transcript>: i will once i start

14:39:14
<transcript>: I will once I start hosting it. Once we move over to astro, we'll have the astro construct.

14:39:18
<transcript>: Next is here. So, dax, I realize I have a misunderstanding here.

14:39:23
<transcript>: I need to pass in like the hosts here. Right.

14:39:31
thdxr: yeah you can bind the astro site to the api and get the value for the future

14:39:31
cowfacedev: he needs to store the url. @thdxr

14:39:43
<transcript>: So I need to pass in the host. I was thinking I could get it from sst, but it won't be until we have the astro site construct. Then I could maybe derive it from the ssd stack right now. I'm just going to have to pass it in like an environment variable because it's actually a separate app altogether. It's the elixir app, right. You can bind the astrocyte to the api and get the value.

14:39:43
<transcript>: for the future

14:39:45
<transcript>: For the future.

14:39:48
thdxr: but shoulnd't the success url be the API?

14:39:50
<transcript>: Bind the astrocyte to the api and get the ea exactly.

14:39:50
<transcript>: shouldn't the success you

14:39:58
<transcript>: Shouldn't the success you be the api. Oh, is it not? Are you sure? Oh, is it I maybe don't remember how many legs are in this thing.

14:40:01
<transcript>: Let's see so.

14:40:02
<transcript>: After.

14:40:02
<transcript>: find a product

14:40:05
pbertrand_dev: success url is where the user goes after paying

14:40:10
<transcript>: Find a product style choose mode. I don't think so. It redirects after creating session. Redirect your customer. Yes. Did that.

14:40:12
thdxr: or you're sending them straight to the frontend after?

14:40:12
<transcript>: Test your page.

14:40:18
<transcript>: I think it is what it redirects to your app on.

14:40:18
<transcript>: you're sending

14:40:28
<transcript>: You're sending them straight to the front end after. Yes. Because then it just listens to webhooks, right? Yeah. It's where they go after paying. So it's going to be a separate thing. But while I have you decks real quick.

14:40:34
<transcript>: If they're not sensitive, do I just use a config parameter.

14:40:34
<transcript>: create

14:40:36
<transcript>: Create.

14:40:36
<transcript>: and then

14:40:38
<transcript>: And then the question is.

14:40:44
<transcript>: Stripe, price ID. That's not sensitive. Oh, this has to be a map, though.

14:40:44
<transcript>: like what

14:40:45
<transcript>: Like, what is this.

14:40:45
<transcript>: or should

14:40:48
<transcript>: Or should I just use secrets.

14:40:48
<transcript>: i'm going to have to also

14:40:51
gitpush_gitpaid: im sensitive

14:40:51
<transcript>: I'm going to have to also do an environment variable for the URL.

14:40:51
<transcript>: i need to

14:40:53
<transcript>: I need to do it like.

14:40:53
<transcript>: per

14:40:54
<transcript>: Per.

14:40:54
<transcript>: environ

14:40:56
<transcript>: Environment.

14:40:56
<transcript>: you know

14:41:00
<transcript>: You know what I'm saying? Turkish sensitive. Also.

14:41:01
thdxr: use Secret for everything it's not well named

14:41:03
<transcript>: Needs to be per environment.

14:41:04
pbertrand_dev: How much do you pay thdxr for the oncall consulting / support ? Must be a pretty sweet gig

14:41:07
<transcript>: Okay.

14:41:14
<transcript>: How much do I pay you, DAX.

14:41:21
<transcript>: Web.

14:41:23
thdxr: Parameter is something we used to have but binding made it less useful

14:41:23
<transcript>: Url.

14:41:24
thechosenone1080: mouse stopped working the day after i get my salary

14:41:25
thechosenone1080: fml

14:41:30
<transcript>: Ac. Url, something.

14:41:34
thdxr: Adam pays me with juicy gossip about him and his wife

14:41:37
thdxr: speaking of you owe me

14:41:38
<transcript>: We used to have, but binding made it less useful. Okay. Oh, I forgot to have to bind something. Here.

14:41:42
<transcript>: Find.

14:41:44
pbertrand_dev: WutFace

14:41:50
<transcript>: What's going on? Why am I getting any type stuff? There we go. Bind.

14:41:54
<transcript>: Apparently, that's not a thing.

14:41:54
<transcript>: i have to

14:41:58
<transcript>: I have to do it in actually, I have to do it in each function.

14:41:58
<transcript>: if i was buying

14:42:00
<transcript>: If I was buying the API.

14:42:04
<transcript>: Api.

14:42:08
<transcript>: I want to bind all the secrets.

14:42:09
thdxr: `defaults.functions.bind`

14:42:11
penairdes: the fedault property

14:42:11
<transcript>: How do I do that.

14:42:15
<transcript>: Yes.

14:42:15
<transcript>: just

14:42:17
<transcript>: Just like this.

14:42:17
<transcript>: default

14:42:19
<transcript>: Default function.

14:42:19
<transcript>: bind

14:42:20
<transcript>: Bind.

14:42:26
<transcript>: But.

14:42:31
<transcript>: Do I just bind this whole secrets, object.

14:42:38
<transcript>: Does that work.

14:42:41
<transcript>: No.

14:42:48
thdxr: you can do `Object.values(Secrets)`

14:42:50
<transcript>: How do I do this? I owe you. I pay you a juicy gossip about him and his wife.

14:42:50
<transcript>: that's

14:42:51
thdxr: or list them out

14:42:52
<transcript>: That's fine.

14:42:52
<transcript>: i picked up

14:42:54
<transcript>: I picked up Values secrets. Okay.

14:42:54
<transcript>: that

14:42:56
<transcript>: That makes sense.

14:42:56
<transcript>: object

14:42:57
thdxr: I prefer listing them out so it's clear

14:42:57
<transcript>: Object.

14:42:57
<transcript>: values

14:42:58
<transcript>: Values.

14:43:07
<transcript>: Okay.

14:43:14
<transcript>: Object values. Oh, wait. What's wrong? Do I need to spread it.

14:43:17
thdxr: remove the array or spread

14:43:17
<transcript>: Just do that.

14:43:22
<transcript>: Remove the array or spread. Yeah. Okay.

14:43:24
<transcript>: Still thinking about it.

14:43:30
<transcript>: For listing the Mount so it's clear.

14:43:30
<transcript>: you mean list

14:43:31
thdxr: it's function not functions

14:43:32
<transcript>: You mean listing them out.

14:43:37
<transcript>: It's function, not functions.

14:43:38
<transcript>: Of.

14:43:38
<transcript>: whether you prefer

14:43:41
<transcript>: Whether you prefer listing out.

14:43:49
<transcript>: Think of the follow sami and the Bunny.

14:43:52
<transcript>: I appreciate those follows.

14:43:53
goodgrandpaa: @thdxr god your brain is nice. Kappa

14:43:55
vapor__dev: each secret instead of Object.values

14:43:56
thdxr: [secrets.STRIPE_KEY, secrets.STRIPE_PRICE_ID] but you don't have to do that

14:43:59
<transcript>: Yeah, dex's brain is nice.

14:44:06
<transcript>: Secret instead of Well, how would I? What do you mean? Oh, I see, I got you, I got you.

14:44:06
thdxr: @GoodGrandPaa well I wrote this framework so I know how to use it lol

14:44:08
thdxr: sometimes

14:44:09
<transcript>: So I would say.

14:44:09
<transcript>: secret

14:44:11
<transcript>: Secret.

14:44:14
<transcript>: Yeah.

14:44:18
<transcript>: I got you.

14:44:20
goodgrandpaa: @thdxr fair enough LUL

14:44:23
<transcript>: Cool. This feels good. Okay.

14:44:25
vapor__dev: dax is the serverless miami cowboy who can't be stopped...

14:44:26
<transcript>: Let's see. So we got an API.

14:44:26
<transcript>: we've got

14:44:30
vapor__dev: LEGEND

14:44:36
<transcript>: We've got this is a git. I don't need that anymore. We just have post checkout, and then we're going to have a bunch of webhook handlers like slash stripe.

14:44:36
<transcript>: oh

14:44:38
<transcript>: Oh, man. Hard work.

14:44:50
<transcript>: The serverless Miami cowboy who can't be stopped.

14:44:51
vapor__dev: why are you so angsty adam, this is fun!

14:44:53
<transcript>: Speaking of dex, are you streaming today.

14:44:53
thdxr: do you think we should add file based routing

14:44:55
goodgrandpaa: I feel like this is the cool side of development. Like creating frameworks seems so deep level and sick.

14:45:00
<transcript>: Why am I so angsty.

14:45:02
<transcript>: This is fun. No.

14:45:02
<transcript>: i think i know

14:45:05
goodgrandpaa: @adamdotdev going to raid study again? Kappa

14:45:09
<transcript>: I think I know what's coming. And the hard part that's coming is I have to connect with a postgres database. I'm dreading it.

14:45:12
<transcript>: Do you think we should add file based routing.

14:45:12
<transcript>: what

14:45:15
<transcript>: What filebase routing? For? What.

14:45:21
vapor__dev: @thdxr this a real thing youre considering?

14:45:22
<transcript>: In what scenario would I use file based routing dash oh like for routes for APIs.

14:45:29
<transcript>: Oh yes, I would actually love that if it's like opt in and you don't have to use it, then you can still just use this route.

14:45:30
thdxr: to pickup your api routes

14:45:33
<transcript>: Do it. Dax, how would you do? Like different verbs.

14:45:36
<transcript>: How would you do different verbs and stuff.

14:45:40
vapor__dev: wow

14:45:41
mr_yan19: I like this new obs layout

14:45:43
<transcript>: Add it, please, that'd be cool.

14:45:52
<transcript>: Mr. Young, you like this new obs layout? Oh, since I came back to streaming. Yeah, I kind of have this different setup.

14:45:52
thdxr: idk I guess how astro does it

14:45:55
<transcript>: Where I'm on one side and the codes on the other.

14:45:58
pbertrand_dev: I prefer DN based routing

14:45:58
thdxr: or you can specify in `ApiHandler`

14:46:01
<transcript>: I guess I Astro does it. I don't remember. Astro does. Oh, they've got like, api handlers. I've not used them yet.

14:46:01
<transcript>: or you can

14:46:04
<transcript>: Or you can specify an api handler. Oh, yeah, that'd be cool.

14:46:09
<transcript>: Yeah. Please do. Sounds nice. Love it.

14:46:09
<transcript>: okay

14:46:15

14:47:21
gitpush_gitpaid: i just learned how to pronounce his name

14:47:22
<transcript>: Like is there a way for me to set different values.

14:47:28
<transcript>: Per environment for these secrets. I guess that's how it works, right? Yeah, I'm sure that's how it works.

14:47:28
<transcript>: welcome

14:47:35
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Franz P. How did you manage to have first option selected for autocomplete when typing on vim.

14:47:41
thdxr: adam frank sent me his parts, he's so funny

14:47:41
<transcript>: I don't know, franz. P. A. Turk. You just learned how to pronounce crochet.

14:47:44
adamdotdev: !dotfiles

14:47:44
fossabot: Adam's dotfiles live here: https://github.com/adamelmore/dotfiles

14:47:56
<transcript>: I don't know if ranch. You could check my dot file. That's how my vim is configured. Frank sent me his parts. Have you put it all together yet? Oh, my goodness. Have you put it all together yet? I can't wait to see the finest. Just whenever you get it done, please send it to me.

14:48:01
<transcript>: Okay.

14:48:01
<transcript>: i need to

14:48:04
<transcript>: I need to set some secrets, and then I need to.

14:48:07
gitpush_gitpaid: whos frank? whats happening

14:48:07
thdxr: not yet I need to wait for unscreen to remove the background

14:48:09
penairdes: @thdxr you mentioned using secrets for everything. What if its not a secret and the value is from a cdk construct?

14:48:11
<transcript>: Success. Url. Translu. This is all done.

14:48:13
daglee: Jim Croce is like PG13 version of Frank Zappa?

14:48:14
<transcript>: So at least the checkout creation is done.

14:48:18
<transcript>: Let it.

14:48:18
<transcript>: hold damn

14:48:20
<transcript>: Hold damn town.

14:48:26
<transcript>: Is it done, though? Is it done.

14:48:27
<transcript>: Yes.

14:48:33
<transcript>: So if I set the secrets, then I'm on to the next phase, which is.

14:48:33
penairdes: Wouldn't Paramter be used in that instance?

14:48:35
<transcript>: Build the front end for it.

14:48:36
thdxr: @penairdes usually you can just bind it if it's an sst construct - otherwise yeah you'd use Config.Parameter. Parameter is for values known inside your stacks code

14:48:38
<transcript>: Which is right here.

14:48:38
<transcript>: and i'll just

14:48:39
cowfacedev: @franzpe there are some cmp options.

14:48:40
<transcript>: And I'll just have to post.

14:48:42
<transcript>: Let's see. How will I do that.

14:48:43
thdxr: Secret is for stuff managed externally

14:48:50
<transcript>: The app will post to the checkout. So how do you link customers? How do I actually.

14:48:52
<transcript>: I don't understand.

14:48:57
<transcript>: How do I like, oh, there's a way to specify the email ahead of time here or something.

14:49:01
<transcript>: There is. I know there is.

14:49:05
<transcript>: Stripe checkout Fulfill Your orders.

14:49:12
<transcript>: There's a way to prefill the email.

14:49:23
<transcript>: I thought I had to create a customer. When do I create a customer.

14:49:27
<transcript>: Fulfill your orders.

14:49:35
<transcript>: So this is where I handle. Okay. So this is the webhook.

14:49:40
<transcript>: We verify.

14:49:40
<transcript>: and then

14:49:42
<transcript>: And then fulfill.

14:49:51
<transcript>: How do I tie it to the customer, or how do I tie it to the user? Oh, so it'd be in the session.

14:49:53
penairdes: @penairdes Got you! Figured

14:49:56
<transcript>: So when someone is a user and I hit the page if they're not a user yet.

14:49:59
<transcript>: I need to create the user.

14:50:03
<transcript>: Yeah. Okay.

14:50:09
<transcript>: I'm getting there in my head I'm getting there secret is for stuff managed Externally.

14:50:12
<transcript>: Usually you can just bind.

14:50:12
<transcript>: if it's

14:50:13
pbertrand_dev: use blockchain to link it to the user

14:50:20
<transcript>: If it's in an SST contract otherwise. Yeah. You use config parameter parameters for values known inside your sex code. Gotcha.

14:50:27
<transcript>: Jim crochet is like pg 13 version of Frank zappa. I don't know who Frank zappa is actually.

14:50:31

14:52:30
<transcript>: Stripe create.

<transcript>: check

14:52:33
<transcript>: Checkout Email address.

14:52:41
<transcript>: I guess. Do I want to prefill the email address? Maybe I don't. I just need to know the customer ID.

14:52:46
vapor__dev: @jokesterA_E have u seen that classic vid of vai talking about his audition for zappa?

14:52:47
<transcript>: How does that work.

14:52:51
<transcript>: When you create a checkout session, do you pass the Customer ID.

14:52:57
<transcript>: Customers are ready to complete their purchase. Oh, here we go, here we go.

14:52:57
<transcript>: send order information

14:52:57
jokestera_e: I have not

14:53:10
<transcript>: Send order information. Create checkout Session Return checkout session. Redirect Customer to url from checkout session. Customer completes payment. Customer returns your application. How do I handle fulfillment? How do I know who just did that.

14:53:11
vapor__dev: @jokesterA_E https://youtu.be/Xx1RguHA4XE

14:53:15
<transcript>: How do I know.

14:53:22
<transcript>: Where can I pass? In.

14:53:26
<transcript>: Something about the user that I can tie it back to.

14:53:26
<transcript>: someone tell

14:53:34
pbertrand_dev: add customer_email param

14:53:34
<transcript>: Someone tell me it's been a while. I've done it like six times, and I don't remember. So I need to look at old code I've written. Don't make me do that.

14:53:40
<transcript>: The Chat gpt now customer email param. Is that what it is.

14:53:43
<transcript>: It's been so long.

14:53:43
<transcript>: is it just down

14:53:45
<transcript>: Is it just down here.

14:53:46
<transcript>: Like.

14:53:46
<transcript>: what

14:53:47
gitpush_gitpaid: is it unprofessional if you start emails with "top of the morning to ya"

14:53:48
<transcript>: What.

14:53:53
<transcript>: Like your customer email. Yes.

14:53:53
<transcript>: well now

14:53:56
<transcript>: Well now I'm not sure that I care if it's the.

14:53:56
<transcript>: customer email

14:53:58
<transcript>: Customer email.

14:54:06
<transcript>: I don't want to force them to okay, so customer ID of an existing customer if one exists in payment mode, the customer's most recent card payment method will be used.

14:54:14
<transcript>: Checkup Agent Subscription Mode so if they don't have a customer, I should go and create them a customer. Right.

14:54:16
<transcript>: Right.

14:54:40
<transcript>: Is it unprofessional? If you start emails with top of the morning to you, I like it.

14:54:42
<transcript>: I'm a fan.

14:54:47
<transcript>: So I think what I do, I think the pattern I've done in the past is I just create a customer.

14:54:48
gitpush_gitpaid: wtf is this i have 998 points

14:54:54
<transcript>: At this point if they don't pass a customer ID, I create a new customer so I keep track.

14:54:54
<transcript>: i associate

14:54:58
<transcript>: I associate it to the user's session or something.

14:55:01
<transcript>: Or I store it in the user table.

14:55:06
<transcript>: Something like that.

14:55:08
jokestera_e: @jokesterA_E LMAO he reallly messed with him

14:55:15
yuji_rexion: evenin'

14:55:16
<transcript>: So now I'm trying to think of how I'm going to secure this thing.

14:55:22
<transcript>: Because.

14:55:26
<transcript>: Mothra our elixir app is going to be.

14:55:31
<transcript>: Hitting this stripe API.

14:55:33
pbertrand_dev: You can also add an metadata array with stuff in it

14:55:34
<transcript>: Okay.

14:55:35
pbertrand_dev: who doesnt like stuff

14:55:39
<transcript>: I'm not going to have the browser do it. It's going to be Mothra.

14:55:44
<transcript>: Do I just want a shared secret.

14:55:50
<transcript>: That it passes in an auth header or something. Yeah, that's what we'll do.

14:55:53
<transcript>: Yes. Right.

14:56:00
<transcript>: Yeah, because the server server communication. I just need to have, like, a shared secret.

14:56:05
<transcript>: Okay, we'll add one more secret here.

14:56:07
<transcript>: One more. For now.

14:56:11
<transcript>: Auth.

14:56:14
<transcript>: We'll just say.

14:56:15
goblin__________________: @gitpush_gitpaid It's better than the old "What's up fam, it's ya boi..."

14:56:21
<transcript>: Api key I could actually create an api key.

14:56:33
<transcript>: Should I use the built in api keys? Oh, is dax here? Should I use built in api keys? Or should I just use a secret.

14:56:35
<transcript>: That's the question. Alan, do you know.

14:56:53
<transcript>: Next question is.

14:56:53
<transcript>: should

14:56:57
<transcript>: Should I use a custom authorizer.

14:57:00
<transcript>: Or.

14:57:05
<transcript>: Just check the value of the secret.

14:57:10
<transcript>: In the Lambda function.

14:57:10
<transcript>: that sounds eas

14:57:12
<transcript>: That sounds easiest.

14:57:18
soeren_______: @gitpush_gitpaid someone with more underscores than me

14:57:18
<transcript>: Okay, because I need to make sure nobody else can call this API.

14:57:22
<transcript>: Just Mothra.

14:57:30
<transcript>: Someone with more underscores than me. That's a lot of underscore.

14:57:30

yuji_rexion: hey, were the exams for aws easy and expected? I'm kinda worried about 'gotcha' problems when I finally decide to take them

14:58:14

14:58:21
<transcript>: As a secret? Or should I use built in api keys? Do they even support api keys.

14:58:33
<transcript>: I don't know. Does ssd even use api Gateway api keys? My question is, should I use a custom authorizer in an api key, or should I just build it into my function code? Because there's a lot of ways I can go with it.

<transcript>: And they always ask me, like, how's your stream? How are you doing? Tell me about your life. And I'm always like, I got to go, I got to pee. So I don't want to do that to you, but I don't want you to feel left out. If you like getting those kinds of things, I'm happy to ask those questions. If you don't just go pee, just go do your thing.
