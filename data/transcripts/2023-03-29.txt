Hey, guys, I'm a little lower energy today because yesterday I had caffeine today. I'm not having caffeine. Actually, today I am having caffeine. I put a little.

00:12:51
<transcript>: I'm hoping.

00:13:00
<transcript>: To just trail off of the caffeine. Usage had a lot yesterday, just a little today and then none. Tomorrow should be good. Probably not.

00:13:04
<transcript>: So did you win? I removed the messages.

00:13:04
<transcript>: you will not be

00:13:06
techsavvytravvy: follow? lol

00:13:24
<transcript>: You will not be told. I didn't do whispers either. You just won't be told if you don't win, the only time we'll get a message is if you win. So if somebody wins, you'll see a message in chat that they won. Otherwise nothing will happen. I think it's best that way because there's a lot of spam, just a lot of people redeeming which you should be got to get a chance at that.

00:13:24
<transcript>: macbook

00:13:25
<transcript>: Macbook.

00:13:25
<transcript>: but

00:13:30

00:22:43
<transcript>: Okay, write your own chat window. You can ignore those redeems if you're only reading it.

00:22:43
<transcript>: oh i could just

00:22:51
<transcript>: Oh, I could just do my own little thing. I already get all the chat messages. Yeah, I would have to be able to render the emotes.

00:22:53
<transcript>: That sounds hard.

00:22:53
<transcript>: it's configurable

00:23:01
smilingbig: we on that slippery caffeine slope

00:23:08
<transcript>: It's configurable in ffz. Okay. Dax asks, is the app done? No. But did you see our progress yesterday? Dax, it's actually kind of incredible how much progress we made in such a short amount of time. I'll show you. You'll see very shortly.

00:23:12
<transcript>: Not on YouTube. I'm not on YouTube. Uhoh, Am I not on YouTube.

00:23:46
<transcript>: Okay, you can reduce latency on YouTube, but not with 4k. Exactly. I want 4k because I want it in the vod. Really, the only reason I'm streaming to YouTube is for the vod. I don't think anyone's going to watch there. I mean, maybe you want to watch. Maybe you want to be 30 seconds behind reality. It's fine with you. Fine with me. Fine with anybody.

00:23:46

endingwithali: How do you stream to YouTube in parallel?

00:23:51
<transcript>: 07:52 a.m.. I'm. In Michigan. You went to bed at 04:00 a.m.. You only slept for 3 hours. Tech savvy.

stroopwafel26: @thdxr he's going for employee of the month

00:24:01
<transcript>: Allie's here. Just finish your workout. I'm so jealous of people who wake up and then work out. That just sounds like such a good idea. And I never can do it.

00:24:11
<transcript>: It's like I always have something. Oh, well, once I'm done with this project, then, yeah, I'll start working out in the morning. Oh, once I'm done with this one, there's always another one. There's never not a project.

00:24:16
vimcerf: a 30 second delay is a lot less than the time it took before Adam read this Kappa

00:24:16
<transcript>: Smiling Big is here. Hey, Adam, Hey, Chat. Hey, Smiling big.

00:24:22
daglee: Been sick for 2 days, went to work, feel like to just sleep in the chair.

00:24:32
<transcript>: Yeah, it's free to play as well. Something to consider. In addition to I want to play more games. I do. Cotter, what's the count? How far are we from bald? Adam, listen, I'm not shaving my head based on dax's follower count. Just not doing it.

00:24:32
<transcript>: so just

00:24:34
<transcript>: So just end the rumor.

00:24:35
kodder: lol

00:24:41
<transcript>: dm d

00:24:45
<transcript>: Dm D. That's the last time I'll say that you're now diamond sounds good.

00:24:46
trivenge: probably restream or something

00:24:46
overra_dev: dax should shave his head at 2k

00:24:56
<transcript>: Okay. I'm scrolling faster. Walk like outside.

00:25:09
<transcript>: The coffee meetup was so good. Oh, live, maz. So the coffee meetup was so good with Jordan and Matt maliro and Live mods. We had a good time. We drank coffee. There was a baby there. It was like, hungover, that movie.

00:25:17
<transcript>: But we were all sober. It was coffee. And we weren't in Vegas. Otherwise, just like it.

00:25:25
manbravegg: lol

00:25:30
<transcript>: Okay. No background tunes. Yeah, I guess my music starts once I switch over to the screen. I guess it's an incentive. Let's do it. Let's just go over to the screen. What do you say, Jason? Four releases soon. That's funny.

00:25:33
aisebaxp: So, nothing like the movie !

00:25:37
<transcript>: Let's see. Okay. Did I catch up with Chad? Almost. Almost. We got music now. At least.

00:25:37
<transcript>: there's that

00:25:38
<transcript>: There's that.

00:25:38
<transcript>: dax

00:25:41
<transcript>: Dax should shave his head at two K. Now we're talking.

00:25:49
<transcript>: Dax get a fresh shave on the day he hits 2000 I bet he will just to celebrate like I want to be clean.

00:25:49
<transcript>: you did

00:25:52
<transcript>: You did see the Progress stacks. I know. Right.

00:25:59
stroopwafel26: it's not a good movie so...

00:25:59
<transcript>: Do you know that? It's just like it's a demo. That's exactly what we're building, right.

00:25:59
<transcript>: but

00:26:04
<transcript>: But hey, it so counts. It's not cheating. Still counts.

00:26:15
joostschuur: Did you say Breakmaster Sullivan?

00:26:21
<transcript>: Let's see. I got to do this thing a little out of sorts without my caffeine. Because now I drink caffeine. I guess. Guess that's the thing. Rebase TV. Everybody sign up for Reef TV. It's going to be very good when we eventually build it, which we're going to dax. I'm very excited.

00:26:21
<transcript>: we've got some

00:26:28
aisebaxp: I think I asked you this before... but not sure if you said something. Is rebase going to have a twitch API?

00:26:33
<transcript>: We've got some wheels in motion, on the music, on the graphics. And now the app is making real progress. Yesterday, when I found that demo app, that's exactly what we need. We're getting there.

00:26:34
trivenge: rebase.tv POGGERS

00:26:35
nzlaura: sick

00:26:41
<transcript>: How do you stream to YouTube in parallel? So Allie.

00:26:48
<transcript>: It's an obs plugin. It's like a multi rmtp or rtmp plugin.

00:26:48
<transcript>: and

00:26:53
trivenge: will rebase have a viewer or audience input for fun?

00:26:57
<transcript>: And you can pick multiple destinations and split your stream. You can use different encoders for each. That's how I'm doing 4k on YouTube and 1080p here.

00:26:57
<transcript>: yeah

00:26:59
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:26:59
<transcript>: maybe ask

00:27:01
<transcript>: Maybe ask that if that wasn't clear.

00:27:05
<transcript>: Ask dev server and I will provide more information.

00:27:18
trivenge: "the audience voted for this" could also do a "phone the audience" thing but idk about that one lol

00:27:19
stroopwafel26: This whole streaming setup is an ad for the Mac Studio

00:27:19
<transcript>: A 32nd delay is a lot less than the time it took before Adam read this. So true, I got to get better. I got to start just like skimming and ignoring things that aren't like real questions to me or something.

00:27:19
<transcript>: so nothing

00:27:24
<transcript>: So nothing like the movie. Yeah, basically. Ai seven. How's it going? Seva.

00:27:24
<transcript>: okay

00:27:25
<transcript>: Okay.

00:27:25
<transcript>: oh typo

00:27:29
<transcript>: Oh, typo, you wrote an extension to filter it out for real.

00:27:30
mecoupz: still waiting for that obs tutorial though

00:27:31
<transcript>: Did you really.

00:27:38
<transcript>: Somebody redeem it. Somebody redeemed the MacBook and let's see if his extension works, and then I want to use it.

00:27:43
<transcript>: Breakmaster. Sullivan. No. Breakmaster. Cylinder. Sorry.

00:27:45
<transcript>: Cylinder.

00:27:45
<transcript>: break

00:27:48
<transcript>: Breakmaster cylinder.

00:27:51

00:27:51
<transcript>: this guy

<transcript>: This guy.

00:27:52
<transcript>: he is one of

00:27:52
cohan: Done

00:27:54
ayoungh: How do you redeem?

00:27:55
parkour_peter: Hello!

00:27:58
<transcript>: He is one of the most interesting individuals I've ever worked with or talked to.

00:27:58
<transcript>: his twitter

00:27:59
impostorengineer: what about the chat overlay on this OBS scene, it doesn't show the redeems.

00:28:00
<transcript>: His Twitter is hilarious.

00:28:00
<transcript>: it's just like

00:28:10
joostschuur: Gotcha. ADHD brain forgot. Thanks!

00:28:13
<transcript>: It's just like I think he lives in a park. And he feeds squirrels. At least that's what he makes it sound like. Some people say he lives on a spaceship. No one's ever seen his face. He's a very interesting guy. Big fan. Brake, master cylinder.

00:28:21
impostorengineer: MrDestructoid and I think it has the emotes

00:28:25
<transcript>: Okay. I think I asked you this before, but not sure if you said something is rebate is going to have a twitch API. A twitch API. Rebates. A twitch API. How would it have a twitch apie or explain to me what it would do with the twitch API.

00:28:32
<transcript>: A viewer or Audience Input for fun.

00:28:32
<transcript>: so the

00:28:37
<transcript>: So the audience let's see the audience voted for this could also be a phone, the audience thing.

00:28:37
<transcript>: yeah maybe

00:28:39
<transcript>: Yeah. Maybe we've talked about doing.

00:28:39
<transcript>: like

00:28:43
aisebaxp: Use it in other channels ? Like a game

00:28:53
<transcript>: Like it'll be simple up front. It's just trivia. But we've talked about, like, having kind of, like, redeems things that you can phone a friend, that kind of thing, like, from Who Wants To Be A millionaire? This whole streaming setup is an ad for the Mac Studio. That's right.

00:29:04
<transcript>: Still waiting for that obs tutorial. Yami, coops, I just decided yesterday that I'm going to do it. I'm just going to make it probably just to be like two or three YouTube videos. Just like setting up.

00:29:04
<transcript>: to be streaming

00:29:09
funkysetiz: YES

00:29:15
ayoungh: Niceee

00:29:23
aisebaxp: So other channels can use the trivia with their own questions

00:29:24
<transcript>: To be streaming your work. There's just some designers as well. Like David, my designer friend, David. I would love to see him stream and if I could make something that would help him get off the ground, it's not the goal of it will not be to have my setup because I've gone way overboard. The goal will just be like you're a dev or you're a designer or some other knowledge worker. And you want to stream your work. What are some things.

00:29:24
<transcript>: that would help

00:29:26
funkysetiz: you read my tweet haha

00:29:29
<transcript>: That would help, just like I learned over the first whatever months of streaming.

00:29:33
<transcript>: So, yeah, a lot of it's obs set up a lot of.

00:29:33
<transcript>: its twitch

00:29:35
<transcript>: Its Twitch culture, whatever.

00:29:35
<transcript>: like learn

00:29:41
<transcript>: Like learn Gen Z slang. That kind of thing. Not really. But you should. Okay.

00:29:46
<transcript>: So we're going to build the rebase app today. We're building it in kotlin.

00:29:46
<transcript>: i'm still not sure

00:29:49
<transcript>: I'm still not sure I understand what jetpack something is.

00:29:52
<transcript>: But that's what we're doing.

00:30:00
<transcript>: Did somebody make a thing that filters out the redeems? That would be fantastic if I could just enable an extension. Oh.

00:30:00
<transcript>: i'm using

00:30:03
<transcript>: I'm using firefox, bummer.

00:30:09
<transcript>: What about the chat overlay on this obs scene? It doesn't show the redeems. Oh, really.

00:30:14
<transcript>: Oh, really? Oh, it's a third party. Oh, could I use it.

00:30:14
<transcript>: could i just

00:30:16
<transcript>: Could I just hit that url? Oh.

00:30:16
<transcript>: okay

00:30:17
thdxr: ChatGPT might not know about this jetpack thing

00:30:19
saint_pyotr: jetpack compose PogChamp

00:30:20
<transcript>: Okay. Going behind the curtain. Hang on. Let's see.

00:30:21
cohan: do you make a new profile to stream? i.e. log in as livestream@ instead of adam@  -- not sure how paranoid I should be LUL

00:30:25
<transcript>: What is that called? Let's see it's in this page.

00:30:29
cohan: on your computer*

00:30:31
<transcript>: I think it's an iframe? Yeah? This night? Dev.

00:30:31
<transcript>: okay

00:30:41
<transcript>: Okay, can I just open that up over here and see my chat in a good way? Oh, can I? Oh, they fade out? Do they fade out? I could turn off the fade.

00:30:44
<transcript>: Let's see. Prevent clipping.

00:30:44
<transcript>: activity

00:30:44
stroopwafel26: the overlay code! long time no see

00:30:45
<transcript>: Activity.

00:30:45
<transcript>: what bot

00:30:52
<transcript>: What? Bot activity false. Fade, false. Sorry, don't mind me.

00:30:57
<transcript>: Riveting content. I'm sure prevent clipping. I don't know. I don't need that.

00:30:57
<transcript>: bot activ

00:31:04
<transcript>: Bot activity false. Let's see, how do I make it not so light and impossible to read.

00:31:04
<transcript>: is there a theme

00:31:09
<transcript>: Is there a theme or something? Channel? Yes. Theme. Dark. Let's make it light.

00:31:14
<transcript>: Hey, oh, this might work people? It might work.

00:31:17
<transcript>: Somebody say something.

00:31:17

<transcript>: Something. Something. I see. Suff. I see some things. It works. It works cool. Thank you, everybody. I'm going to try using this. If I miss something in Chat, I'll be bummed. But this might work.

00:31:50
<transcript>: My professor in College in 2009 iframes are bad to use they're only ever used for bad ad placement don't ever use iframes if you can yeah I know.

00:31:50
<transcript>: iframes

00:31:58
<transcript>: Iframes are usually bad, I wouldn't do it in a consumer facing thing. Well, no, I don't know. Actually. I think it's probably fine.

00:32:15
<transcript>: It does feel dirty to use an iframe because it's just like always felt hard to make it look how I want it when I'm doing that. But for this, it's great. It's my chat thing on the overlays works. Works great. So I'm not seeing redeems. Feels good. Feels good. Adam isn't an AI.

00:32:15
<transcript>: is a

00:32:17

00:32:31
overra_dev: depends on the use case. third-party javascript uses iframes

00:32:34
<transcript>: Next J. Uhoh, that's not where I want to be.

00:32:36

00:33:09
ayoungh: Adam you are cool

00:33:13
nzlaura: now for aws to use clean energy :>

00:33:19
<transcript>: My little dent in the universe. I'm using clean energy to stream on twitch. Now I guess there's parts of the pipeline that are not clean energy, like twitches servers and whatever else, but from my house, all of this electricity powering, all these lights, these cameras, whatever. They're coming from the sun. I think that's true. It's like.

00:33:19
<transcript>: one hundred and fifty

00:33:24
<transcript>: 150% of our electricity usage, so yeah, we should be good, should be covered.

00:33:25
<transcript>: Okay.

00:33:25
<transcript>: let's see

00:33:27
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:33:34
<transcript>: Yes, go vertical. And then a couple of horizontals rebase is a very involved thing. You got to run a lot of things.

00:33:34
<transcript>: in re

00:33:35
aisebaxp: You should put a green energy logo in your stream

00:33:36
<transcript>: In rebase.

00:33:36
<transcript>: if you want to run

00:33:40
<transcript>: If you want to run rebase locally it's a lot.

00:33:40
<transcript>: let's start

00:33:42
<transcript>: Let's start with.

00:33:42
<transcript>: let's see

00:33:44

00:33:48
<transcript>: profile

00:33:49
<transcript>: Profile? Yeah.

00:33:49
<transcript>: exp

00:33:56
<transcript>: Export AWS profile. Don't look at that. Nobody look at it. Export AWS.

00:33:56
<transcript>: oh

00:33:59
mecoupz: everyone copied the stream key? :D

00:34:00
trivenge: wait

dmdboi: Write that down, write that down

00:34:06
trivenge: LOL

00:34:06
<transcript>: Oh, man, I just leaked it like so many times. Export export. Aws, profile. My stream key getting out there. Everyone copy the stream key.

00:34:06

00:34:21
<transcript>: It's not true. But that would be cool. That'd be cool. If I wrote 100% clean code.

dmdboi: LUL

00:34:33
nzlaura: there has gotta be a shell plugin for that

00:34:38
<transcript>: To ibs, which means I do need to do the stream key thing. Let's just do this. Did it work? Is it fuzzy? I don't think my fuzzy thing works.

00:34:47
<transcript>: Why do you need to export it to his profile? I don't remember dax. I think it's when I do. Pmpm. Sso. Maybe not. Do I not need to. Maybe I don't need to. I don't know.

00:34:47
<transcript>: tell me dax why

00:34:49
<transcript>: Tell me, dax. Why do I need to.

00:34:49
<transcript>: why

00:34:53
<transcript>: Why do I. Oh, I don't. Okay, cool.

00:35:02
trivenge: i would change your stream key lol

00:35:03
nzlaura: depends on your default profile

00:35:05
<transcript>: I can't make my fuzzy thing work, so I guess I'm just going to leak all my secrets today. Why is it not working? Last pack. Get out of my face. Adam elmore, that's me. Sign in.

00:35:17
<transcript>: I love ubi keys because I always feel so secure. Like you guys might have seen my password or something, but you don't have my ubi key. You can't touch it. It's not in your office. You know what I'm saying.

00:35:17
<transcript>: two dor

00:35:23
<transcript>: Two dorks is here, and no Sheffield is here. Noel Sheffield is a robot, though.

00:35:23
<transcript>: i think

00:35:26

00:35:32
<transcript>: Singer artificial? Not intelligent? Ouch, dax? Ouch.

00:35:49
<transcript>: Everything on Earth is powered by the sun. I guess so, but mine is more directly powered by the sun. You know what I'm saying? Hey, young Adam, you are cool. Wow. You're looking for a vip badge? Because I'll give you one. You say something like that.

00:35:49
<transcript>: you

00:35:51
daglee: But we know where you live? And your password! Mohahaha!

00:35:51
<transcript>: You'll get it.

00:36:00
<transcript>: Put a green energy logo in your stream. That's awesome. Actually, I'm going to do a little banner that rotates at the bottom that this stream is powered by the Sun.

00:36:05
<transcript>: Okay, don't rewind people. Would you stop trying to get my secret.

00:36:10
trivenge: how dare you use a yubikey and be like, all security conscious and stuff

00:36:11
trivenge: NotLikeThis

00:36:13
<transcript>: Use deer ends. Then you can skip all these steps. That's interesting. Alice. There sounds nice.

00:36:24
<transcript>: Rip. You guys just all got my stream key, I guess. Well, you don't know the URL though. Ha. So there.

00:36:31
<transcript>: I would change your stream key. Yeah, probably.

00:36:44
<transcript>: We know where you live and your password. You know where I live? Dagley. Does anyone know where I live? I thought about this yesterday. Does anyone on the Internet have my address? I hope not. Don't paste it in chat. If you do, please don't.

00:36:46
fryday444: Ozarks

00:36:46
<transcript>: Okay.

00:36:48
fryday444: lol

00:36:48
kryotoboi: Would it be green energy if I power the stream through burning wood ? Trees are green ? No ?

00:36:52
mecoupz: we could ask your mom to get us your yubikey xD

00:36:59
<transcript>: I got to do. What am I doing? Oh, I sso, pmpm sso. Let's do it in, like every one of these shell sessions. I probably did one extra, but that's okay. You could ask my mom to give us your ubi key.

00:37:01
daglee: Ozarks behind the mobsters house!

00:37:03
<transcript>: My mom did show up yesterday in Chat. That was fun.

00:37:05
dmdboi: Can we redeem channel points for your address?

00:37:06
<transcript>: Bmbmsso.

00:37:13
<transcript>: I really like foles. Foles has become my new alt J.

00:37:13
<transcript>: it's not

00:37:17
maleero: Is the MacBook giveaway bot not running?

00:37:18
<transcript>: It's not like replaced AltJ because you could never replace lj, but.

00:37:18
<transcript>: i feel like

00:37:23
<transcript>: I feel like that's my go to right now is false because it is okay.

00:37:23
<transcript>: let's do this

00:37:28
<transcript>: Let's do this. We're going to do pmpm dev. Actually, just in case I'm going to do.

00:37:34
<transcript>: Git pull. Because dax might have done something. No. Okay. Pmpm. Dev.

00:37:36
<transcript>: Index.

00:37:40
aisebaxp: How many coins for a trip to the Ozarks?

00:37:43
saint_pyotr: have you listened to Foals' first album? it's definitely my fav

00:37:56
<transcript>: His name escapes me. Why can't I think of his name? How'd it go yesterday? I should have said that. How did it go? Aaron Francis. Good friend. Aaron Francis. That I couldn't remember his name. So sorry, Aaron. Aaron catching strays. How did it go with Aaron? I missed it because of my coffee date.

00:37:59
<transcript>: How was it.

00:37:59
<transcript>: ozark

00:38:04
<transcript>: Ozark's behind the mobster's house. You've got it. You do know where I live. Don't tell anyone else.

00:38:09
nzlaura: monkaS

00:38:10
<transcript>: Maliro.

00:38:15
kinotheproducer: Oh wow, I liked that moving keyboard cam, do you have that gear linked anywhere?

00:38:29
<transcript>: The macbook bot is running. It just doesn't announce if you lose, it felt like a lot. We were getting a lot of messages, and they were all downers. So now it only says if you win. So we haven't seen a message today because no one has won. Maliro brought his baby to coffee yesterday and we had a good time. What a good time.

00:38:29
<transcript>: it

00:38:37
<transcript>: It's interesting how fun it is to meet people in person. Turns out the Internet has not replaced human contact altogether.

00:38:37
<transcript>: hey it'd be cool

00:38:43
<transcript>: Hey, it'd be cool, Melira. If you won, because I could just, like, drive it over to you. We could meet it. I don't know.

00:38:50
<transcript>: Coffee place. And I could hand you a macbook. That'd be cool. I wouldn't have to spend $500 shipping it to Italy. That'd be really cool, actually.

00:38:52
<transcript>: I'm going to pull a little.

00:38:58
<transcript>: Geographical bonus in there. You live close to me. The closer the higher the chance of winning.

00:39:00
<transcript>: That sounds fair.

00:39:11
bebenzer: 500$ to ship it to italy?

00:39:14
<transcript>: How many coins for a trip to the ozarks? It's hard to fly to the ozarks. There's just like no direct flights. You have to connect from wherever you are. What did I do? Did I just pmpm sso again? No.

00:39:16
trivenge: cant someone just use your stream key to stream anything using your account anywhere, and get your account banned in that sense, yubikey aside?

00:39:19
<transcript>: Okay. So now next step, we're going to push.

00:39:19
<transcript>: the what

00:39:27
<transcript>: The. What else do I have to run? Maybe nothing. I don't need to run their producer app. Oh, I do need to run the producer app. So packages.

00:39:27
<transcript>: produce

00:39:28
mecoupz: maybe a flight is cheaper than paying for shipping?

00:39:29
<transcript>: Producer.

00:39:29
trivenge: if so, that seems dangerous. could be wrong though

00:39:29
sj_se: If you set the macbook for pickup at a local apple store then you dont have to pay for shipping to another country.

00:39:32
<transcript>: App we're going to do pmpm Dev.

00:39:37
<transcript>: We're going to open that up in a tab.

00:39:43
<transcript>: Yes. Just like that. So here's our producer app. Is it on Port 3000.

00:39:51
<transcript>: Is it? I guess so. Okay. Now we're going to pump some ivs. Let's see.

00:40:00
<transcript>: The next thing I need to do is I guess over here I'm going to push D into packages.

00:40:00
<transcript>: what

00:40:01
<transcript>: What is it.

00:40:04
<transcript>: Android studio.

00:40:08
mecoupz: @sj_se big brain

00:40:17
<transcript>: Have you listened to the full first album? No. St. Pointer. Preorder. I have not, but we're going to do it right now.

00:40:17
<transcript>: that's

00:40:21
<transcript>: That's how excited I am about this idea of their first album.

00:40:21
<transcript>: all jay i

00:40:22
saltyohm: greetings earthling

00:40:29
<transcript>: All. Jay, I like most of their old stuff more than their new stuff. And their new stuff is great, but it makes sense. People's old stuff sometimes the best.

00:40:29
<transcript>: let's see

00:40:38
<transcript>: Let's see what's the first album is. This. It 2008 antidotes. Is this it I can't see chat. So I don't know. Is this it.

00:40:41
<transcript>: I'm gonna go with it. Here we go.

00:40:43
saint_pyotr: Antidotes yup

00:40:44
<transcript>: All Right. Here we go.

00:40:44
<transcript>: wow

00:40:49
<transcript>: Wow. I like that moving keyboard Cam. Do you have that gear linked anywhere.

00:40:58
<transcript>: Ken. I don't have the I don't have that specific gear. It's an edel Chrome rig. I don't have that linked anywhere. I need to write that up. I guess.

00:41:12
<transcript>: Would it be green energy if I power the stream through burning wood? Trees are green. No, I don't. You might have a case cryo. I think some people would take issue with that, but okay, don't show tips. Close all.

00:41:19
<transcript>: This is the app that we're going to consume the stream from. I guess I don't need to go into anything over here.

00:41:25
<transcript>: We'll just invim the whole thing. What was I thinking? Nvim the whole thing.

00:41:36
<transcript>: There's that. Now let's pump some. Okay, I'm going to go fudgey. How do I go fuzzy? Why is the fuzzy not working? Fuzzy. Just like that? And then I'm going to do export.

00:41:37
kinotheproducer: Oooh. I've been looking into edelkrone sliders, so that's nice to see. I'm assuming you run multiple DSLRs?

00:41:43
<transcript>: Export stream channel. No. Url. What is it.

00:41:48
<transcript>: Ingest endpoint export stream key.

00:41:48
<transcript>: yes

00:41:50
<transcript>: Yes.

00:41:52
<transcript>: Now I'm going to do.

00:41:52
<transcript>: ff

00:41:59
sj_se: Settings -> New UI -> Enable new UI for a cleaner IDE with JetBrains products

00:42:06
<transcript>: Ffmpeg. Aha. Okay, we're pumping some video to the thing to ivs. Cool. Okay, I can turn off fuzzy. Why is fuzzy not work? Why can't I hit the button and turn off fuzzy anymore? It's annoying.

00:42:06
<transcript>: that's

00:42:09
<transcript>: That's annoying to me.

00:42:17
nzlaura: @sj_se it is pretty nice

00:42:22
<transcript>: Okay, so we've got some ivs stuff pumping in here. Yeah, it's working. So Rick, Roll playing on the ivs channel. We've got our sample questions that I can send. Oh, let's open airplay or airtable.

00:42:22
<transcript>: airta

00:42:25
<transcript>: Airtable data questions.

00:42:25
<transcript>: all right

00:42:30
<transcript>: All Right, look how productive I am Today. Anybody, anybody, anybody notice.

00:42:39
<transcript>: Can't someone just use your stream key to stream anything using your account anywhere and get your account banned in that sense.

00:42:39
<transcript>: so

00:42:40
saltyohm: I just tuned in and I'm already being rickrolled :(

00:42:42
<transcript>: So triv, that was not my Twitch stream key.

00:42:42
<transcript>: it's a stream

00:42:42
mecoupz: yeah i prefer new ui too

00:42:50
<transcript>: It's a stream key for this. This is our rebase thing. And it's just my dev account in rebase. So yes, someone could if they knew the.

00:42:50
<transcript>: ingest

00:42:51
trivenge: ohhh

00:42:53
trivenge: gotcha

00:42:59
<transcript>: Ingest URL they could stream with that stream key to here, but I'd probably just laugh. That'd be fun. It'd be fun if you want to stream some video here that.

00:42:59
<transcript>: wasn't

00:43:16
dmdboi: Where do we find the ingest url

00:43:17
andom: Howdy HeyGuys

00:43:19
<transcript>: Wasn't as long as it's safer work. I'm good with that. No explicit content, but if you want to stream something, go for it. You can figure out the ingest endpoint and copy that stream URL from the vod or the stream key. Go for it. It'll be actually kind of fun. Maybe I'll just briefly leak the ingest endpoint as well, just because it'd be kind.

00:43:19
<transcript>: of fun would it

00:43:24
dmdboi: Is it redeemable for channel points?

00:43:27
trivenge: LUL

00:43:28
<transcript>: Of fun? Would it be kind of fun if somebody puts that piece that puzzle together and then they run ffmpeg and they stream some video here, and it overrides my stream. That'd be kind of fun.

00:43:48
<transcript>: Let's see. Maybe a flight is cheaper than paying for shipping. Maybe if you set the macbook for pickup at a local Apple store, then you don't have to pay for shipping to another country. Yeah. I think in retrospect, that would be the way to do these. Giveaways the first time I'd already bought it. So it was in my possession and then I needed to get it. Somebody. This time I'm going to buy it when someone wins and.

00:43:48
<transcript>: have it

00:43:52
<transcript>: Have it sent to them so I can do the smart thing.

00:43:56
<transcript>: Greeting, salty, salty is here.

00:44:04
<transcript>: All right, let's see. I'm thinking Friday, dac, by the way, if you're here, I'm thinking Friday. I'm going to stream a totally different time. I just realized.

I'm going to try just on Friday to stream a little later. So I'll start maybe like toward the end of what I normally would maybe like start 2 hours later. Go 2 hours later. I don't know.

<transcript>: Svin, welcome to Chat. Is it expensive living in the ozarks? No, it's quite affordable. I mean, relative to other places in the United States, compared to some other places in the world, probably very expensive. But compared to living in San Francisco or New York, super cheap.

00:48:34
itsmeleague: Dang almost 8 months already

00:48:38
<transcript>: Let's see. Welcome to Chat. Less a mat.

00:48:44
<transcript>: were just

00:48:52
<transcript>: Were just doing a command. It's like they had something they needed to do in my channel. They weren't really necessarily trying to get involved and talk with me.

i_am_monsta: quite rare nowdays to find quality streamers ;p

00:49:11
lasamat: I'm a weird guy. Its my specialty to make other people feel weird as well

00:49:12
<transcript>: Which is fine. I totally understand it, but it feels like welcome, but kind of welcome. I don't want to bother you if you're just like popping in because you need to find out how long you followed me. But if you want to stick around and talk, I would love for you to stick around and talk. You know what I'm saying? Feels a little strange. So, alper, thank you so much about follow. I don't know how many of you are just following me because I asked you to, but maybe I should just ask you to, you know.

I like when you follow me because I think that means you'll come back. And when you come back, we get to get to know each other better. We get to hang out. We get to work together, see what I'm doing right now. I'm working. This is me working.

00:49:31
<transcript>: i actually have done

00:49:34
vimcerf: @Lasamat sounds like twitch is just the right place for you!

00:49:36
<transcript>: I actually have done some work today. I feel like I can say that with a straight face. I'm working.

00:49:42
bigbandzjosh: I've been popping in here for a couple weeks now, I'm a quiet person so I don't chat too often lol

00:49:43
stroopwafel26: you people count: 1

00:49:44
<transcript>: So yeah, if you follow me, that means you'll get notified when I stream again. Unless you're frag, he never gets notifications. But if you do get notifications.

00:49:56
<transcript>: but

00:50:03

00:50:19
<transcript>: It's Me League. Almost eight months already. Wow. Seven months, 20 days. It blows my mind that some of you guys have followed me for that long because it doesn't seem like I've been streaming that long because I took a three month break. That could be why.

00:50:24
<transcript>: It's like starting a new life. There you go. Typo. Sorry. I'll always remember that you were following before.

00:50:24
<transcript>: your follow

<transcript>: Have a good one waiting for Anna release more YouTube content in the future. I'm doing it triv. I'm making a whole I'm going to make a whole mini course on streaming your work because I've gotten much joy and fulfillment from it. Should I just upgrade gradle while I'm just talking?

joostschuur: Bleep bloop. Not a bit. Affirmative. Bloop! ü§ñ

00:52:02
<transcript>: I don't believe you've ever told me your favorite color. It was a trick question. Was it a trick question.

00:52:07
nzlaura: yes

00:52:09
nzlaura: hahaha

00:52:09
<transcript>: Or is it your Is it the way you show up in Chat? Is it light blue? Is that your favorite color.

00:52:12
bigbandzjosh: What are your opinions on Java? It's been the main language we've focused on in college, and I'm curious if many companies use Java for their products?

00:52:21
nzlaura: trick question hah

00:52:25
<transcript>: No you've never told me.

00:52:27
<transcript>: You never told me.

00:52:27
<transcript>: listen

00:52:28
nzlaura: sarcasm is lost on the internet

00:52:28
<transcript>: Listen.

00:52:33
<transcript>: You people you can't just expect. I'm sorry I just want to say you people again.

00:52:38
<transcript>: Trick questions. Sarcasm is lost on the Internet. Yeah, no, it's hard.

00:52:38
<transcript>: but i

00:52:48
<transcript>: But I thought maybe for a moment that was like a thing, like a bond we had at one point, I don't remember much. This is something my wife is not a fan of. I don't remember a whole lot.

00:52:48
<transcript>: and i thought

00:52:53
<transcript>: And I thought maybe it was just a thing I forgot. But it was like a thing we had just want to make sure.

00:52:53
<transcript>: big

00:52:56
<transcript>: Big Bands, Josh. Welcome to chat.

00:52:56
nzlaura: damn i ruined it

00:53:05
<transcript>: What are your opinions on java? It's been the main language we focus on in College, and I'm curious if many companies use java for their products. Here's what I would say.

00:53:14
<transcript>: I'm thinking about what I would say here's what I would say. I would say that.

00:53:23
<transcript>: I'm distracted. I've been popping in here for a couple of weeks now. I'm a quiet person, so I don't chat often. That's all right. Big bands.

00:53:25
neochromer: @BigBandzJosh yes.. there is a lot of Java

00:53:27
<transcript>: I knew I had saw new message on your name and then I didn't see it and.

00:53:27
<transcript>: it threw me

00:53:27
lilcheeto976: What are the chances of me landing a job after an associates in software development? I‚Äôm thinking of changing my major

00:53:30
fryday444: If you want to work for older companies, Java is pretty common.

00:53:35
<transcript>: It threw me off. So here's what I would say about Java. It's like the gateway drug to a lot of things. And that's what I learned first in College was Java.

00:53:35
<transcript>: actually

00:53:37
neochromer: I currently work with Java not voluntarely

00:53:37
fryday444: Not so much for startups and smaller companies

00:53:37
<transcript>: Actually, what I learned first was.

00:53:37
<transcript>: jython

00:53:43
mecoupz: i also started with java in evening school. gateway drug nr 1

00:53:44
<transcript>: Jython which is java and python. And I'm just now remembering all that. And what a weird concept.

00:53:55
bigbandzjosh: Oh goodness Jython sounds very weird LOL

00:54:02
kryotoboi: Why Did I learn VB.net first ?

00:54:04
<transcript>: It's like java, but with python syntax. I don't know why they think they should teach us that. Like, hey, here's. If you mash two two languages together, take one of them's runtime and the other syntax. Let's just mash those together and make a baby and teach you that because that'll be useful in your career. Maybe they're trying to teach us that languages don't matter. I don't know.

00:54:04
<transcript>: anyway giant

00:54:14
<transcript>: Anyway, Giant, that's what I started with. And then it was java. A lot of java. I was just in school for like three semesters, but it's like similar syntactically to a lot of.

00:54:14
<transcript>: other

00:54:20
pulldtrigger94: Jython? How long have you been programing?

00:54:21
<transcript>: Other C drived languages, I guess Squiggly's and curly braces and semicolons.

00:54:23
<transcript>: But the.

00:54:23
<transcript>: actual

00:54:27
fearmygaze: i learned PASCAL first

00:54:33
<transcript>: Actual organization of java applications I'm learning drives me crazy because of this kotlin experience. It's a little verbose. It feels a little like.

00:54:33
<transcript>: old school

00:54:35
<transcript>: Old School MVC.

00:54:35
<transcript>: that's fine

00:54:41
<transcript>: That's fine. It's good to get your feet wet and kind of like, learn the basics of programming.

00:54:41
<transcript>: for lo

00:54:45
typosrry: ^ pascal

00:54:45
juniornascm: @BigBandzJosh Java is a great language, have a lot of jobs, but i think learn koitlin is better, has a lot of great libs, personally spring boot, is a powerfull framework (i think). is like .net in c# (but with less ecosystem)

00:54:47
<transcript>: For loops, conditionals, whatever data structures, but then eventually.

00:54:47
<transcript>: it won't be too

00:54:48
<transcript>: It won't be too.

00:54:54
<transcript>: Dissimilar when you move into things like JavaScript typescript.

00:54:59
<transcript>: Similar feel. At least syntactically. That's what I think about Java.

00:54:59
<transcript>: and also

00:55:07
nzlaura: my first language was perl, purely to write an irc bot lolz

00:55:08
<transcript>: And also Java used a lot. You want to go work for a big company. They're probably using some Java, like Amazon. All aws is built in Java.

00:55:13
<transcript>: Like big companies use Java so it's good for jobs. Probably.

00:55:16
<transcript>: Okay. I'm done.

00:55:25
<transcript>: What are the chances? Welcome to Chat Little cheeto. What are the chances of landing a job after an Associate in software development, I'm thinking of changing my major.

00:55:31
bigbandzjosh: Interesting! thanks!

00:55:32
<transcript>: Landing a job after an associate. An associates in soccer. Like a two year degree.

00:55:38
<transcript>: I think landing a job. I don't know, people who has good advice about this. I've had such a weird career.

00:55:38
<transcript>: i've never

00:55:43
lasamat: Almost no java jobs in my country. I'd rather consult job offers on popular sites for your country

00:55:48
<transcript>: I've never done a normal thing where you just apply for a job and get it. I've always had weird circumstances. Does anyone have normal advice for people who are looking to get a job with an associate's degree.

00:55:55
joostschuur: See the kind of companies that are hiring for Java and ask yourself if you want to work for them, or anticipate needing to learn another language soon thereafter

00:55:56
<transcript>: Notification came 18 minutes later. That's weird.

00:55:59
<transcript>: That's weird.

00:56:07
juniornascm: I might be biased, but today c# is an of the better language to make API and microservices, beucase the ecosystem. I really dont know any other platform that you have so good integration, microsoft made a great job with .net IMO

00:56:08
<transcript>: Why am I so distracted by chat? I just want to read your chat and hang out with you people. I think I'm socially starved. I think that's the problem.

00:56:09
fryday444: Apply to manufacturing companies. They have a VERY hard time finding good devs.

00:56:17
<transcript>: I get no social interaction outside of my coffee date yesterday and hanging out with my wife and my kids and my living nanny.

00:56:22
neochromer: @adamdotdev you should switch to Just Chatting

00:56:24
earholesmcgee: Ill hang out with you Adam :)

00:56:36
<transcript>: I just don't get a lot of interaction. So when you guys are talking, it's like, hey, what are you guys up to? I just want to read it. She'll hang out. Should I just go into just chatting? Should I stop pretending like I'm going to write code? I really want to write code. I have to get some stuff done. Should I do it? Should I write code? Should I just ignore you guys? Jathon sounds very weird. It is very weird.

00:56:37
nzlaura: @lilcheeto976 showcase side projects, it'll help your chances considerably

00:56:39
<transcript>: If you want to work for older companies, Java is pretty common.

lilcheeto976: Is it hard to get a developer job in general?

00:56:43
2dorkstv: I had an AS degree and nabbed a desktop support job in the early days. Still have an AS and have mainly always gone up the ladder by doing good work and being kind :P

00:56:52
<transcript>: Why did I learn vb. Net first? Oh, maybe your school went with a vb approach. That's another approach.

00:56:53
earholesmcgee: Have you been diagnosed with ADHD?

00:57:00
joostschuur: Degrees don't matter for any job but your first one. If you don't have one, make it up with side projects.

00:57:02
<transcript>: Pull D trigger this would have been in College back in 2006 that I would have learned jathon.

00:57:05
<transcript>: Learn pascal first.

00:57:06
nzlaura: @lilcheeto976 a good dev job? yes

00:57:13
2dorkstv: @earholesmcgee I think ADHD is a requirement for twitch streaming :D

00:57:18
<transcript>: That sounds even more. I just realized I don't get first time chat notification in this window. That's a problem. That's a problem. I like to know when somebody's new around here.

00:57:23
neochromer: I also learned BASIC and Pascal in middle school

00:57:36
earholesmcgee: @2DorksTV HAHA!

00:57:40
<transcript>: I knew fear. My gaze was a new person. I had to go to my other chat window to find out. Welcome to Chat. Fear my gaze. I did not recognize your name, and it's because you're new here. Welcome. Welcome to my chat. You should switch to just chatting. Maybe I should. Maybe I should. Neo crumber says I should.

00:57:51
juniornascm: Pascal was the first lang i learned with an IDE called pascalzim a compiler maded by an brazilian, it was fun

00:57:54
mecoupz: you need a "not reading chat on yt come over to twitch" overlay :D

00:57:55
<transcript>: Java's a great language. Have a lot of jobs, but I think learn kotlin is better, has a lot of great libs. Personally Spring Boot is a powerful framework. I think it's like net and C sharp but with less ecosystem.

00:58:00
aisebaxp: You can do whatever it pleases you... if we are still here after whatever you say or not... we are you audience... or not

00:58:01
<transcript>: First language with Pearl purely to write an irc bot. That's awesome.

00:58:08
earholesmcgee: You should probs use a tomato timer so you can set focus time and chat time. 10 minutes coding, 5 minutes chatting

00:58:10
2dorkstv: you're talking about code. I think your category is still good

00:58:21
<transcript>: Okay, I might be biased, but today C Sharp is one of the better language to make api and microservices because the ecosystem. I really don't know any other platform that you can have so good at integration. Microsoft made a great job with Net. In my opinion. That's where I started. So in College I started with learning Jath.

00:58:21
<transcript>: jathon

00:58:28
<transcript>: Jathon but in python and java. But once I actually got real jobs, it was with Net. That's how I started C sharp.

00:58:28
<transcript>: a pydom manu

00:58:33
<transcript>: A. Pydom. Manufacturing companies. They have a very hard time finding good devs. Interesting.

00:58:35
joostschuur: We learned Pascal first when I went to university in Germany in 1991. But I already coded at home before in Basic and C

00:58:39
cohan: Nice, I started with an IRC bot too.. my first language was mIRCscript lol

00:58:40
<transcript>: Earth ear holes is going to hang out with me. That's awesome. Thank you. Your holes. Thanks for hanging out.

00:58:47
<transcript>: Playlist. That's actually an older playlist. Although it's a goodie oldie bit of goody. We might go back to that one.

00:58:47
<transcript>: is it

00:58:57
<transcript>: Is it hard to get a developer job in general? Again, I just have no good advice for those types of questions. I wish I did. I think right now it's not a great hiring market. So I will say that.

00:59:05
<transcript>: I should just come over here. If I'm going to just talk, I'm just going to read, chat and talk to you. I should just come over here and accept it.

00:59:05
<transcript>: should just

00:59:09
<transcript>: Should just lean into it. Embrace that I'm just chatting right now.

00:59:09
nzlaura: @cohan hahaha i miss mIRC

00:59:17
<transcript>: I had an associate's degree and nabbed a desktop support job in my early days. Still have an associate's degree. I think that's what as is and have.

00:59:17
<transcript>: mainly

00:59:19
mecoupz: i received my contract for a new job today lol

00:59:23
<transcript>: Mainly always gone up the ladder by doing good work and being kind. There you go. Two doors. There's my best advice.

00:59:36
<transcript>: You want to further your career? I don't know about getting in the door. I don't know about getting a normal job. I've just not done it. I've never had a resume. I've never had a normal job. I work for myself. I started a company. I worked for myself. I'm back at the company I started.

00:59:36
<transcript>: i've not had

00:59:51
dslegends: I'm a mid lifer, switched careers from general IT to dev.  Hard to get a job so far, but doesn't stop me.  Spent last couple years working with vuejs and supabase and everything inbetween.

00:59:56
<transcript>: I've not had a normal career so I can't tell you how to get a job and leak code and all that stuff. What I can tell you is if you want to progress in whatever you're in once you get in the door, do really good work like try hard and be kind. It will take you far. Listen to two dorks I think most of like my consulting success like any success I had where I was making more.

00:59:56
<transcript>: money

00:59:59
overra_dev: @cohan yo me too way back

01:00:01
cohan: @nzlaura good times haha, I wrote a markov chain (caveman AI) bot in it before moving on to other languages LUL

01:00:03
<transcript>: Money every year was because I just kept doing a good job delivering for people and being kind and easy to work with.

01:00:19
joostschuur: The real answer is that any specific answer almost always depends on the person, they're location and personality. Hard to give any definitive answer. Many people too a weird path and got lucky.

01:00:19
<transcript>: That'll get you a long ways longcat log cat web thank you for the follow. Also. Lil Cheeto, Lil Cheeto. I like when people have little in their name, it's just kind of fun to say Lil Cheeto. Wow. Cheetos haven't had a cheeto in, like 20 years. That's interesting.

01:00:29
fragaverage: I WON I WON

01:00:31
<transcript>: Cheetos. I forgot about cheetos. Forgot they were a thing. The puffy kind. The crunchy kind. They're both good. Crunchy were better. Both good, though. Okay. Have you been diagnosed with adhd? I've not been diagnosed.

01:00:36
nzlaura: @cohan sick!

01:00:42
<transcript>: We did a test on Stream the other day to see if I had autism. And it says strong likelihood that I'm autistic adhd. Probably. Who knows? I probably got all the letters.

01:00:42
<transcript>: probably

01:00:52
<transcript>: Probably. I guess. Like if you want to stream on twitch, maybe that's good. I don't know. Maybe those letters suit me for sitting here and talking to you people.

01:01:01
juniornascm: can you send me the site to make the autistc test?

01:01:02
<transcript>: Degrees don't matter for any job, but your first one if you don't have one, make it up with side projects Side projects are great. I prefer making side projects that I want to exist.

01:01:02
<transcript>: not

01:01:08
earholesmcgee: probably have all the letters hahahahahahahaha

01:01:18
<transcript>: Not arbitrary things that somebody on a tutorial said you should build like I could never get excited about building a Twitter clone just because I'm going to learn something by doing it. I want to build something I'm going to use and it's going to make my life better. And there's so many things low hanging fruit that you could make that'll make your life better.

01:01:26
<transcript>: I think adhd is a requirement for streaming. I know there's a lot of streamers with adhd, so it's very possible that it helps.

01:01:26
<transcript>: also learn

01:01:26
thdxr: remember when you built a twitter clone

01:01:28
funkysetiz: true that

01:01:31
<transcript>: Also learn Basic and pascal in middle school. Oh, my goodness, Neochromer Middle School. That's amazing.

01:01:31
<transcript>: do you know what i was

01:01:35
<transcript>: Do you know what I was doing in middle school? Nothing.

01:01:35
<transcript>: i don't even

01:01:36
<transcript>: I don't even remember.

01:01:36
<transcript>: nothing product

01:01:39
<transcript>: Nothing productive. That's for sure.

01:01:39
<transcript>: definitely

01:01:42
<transcript>: Definitely not learning programming languages.

01:01:45
bigbandzjosh: This is my biggest struggle as a first year... I don't want just build to build.. I want to make something I'll use, I find it so hard to just make something to make it

01:01:46
<transcript>: Pascal was the first link I learned with an IDE called.

01:01:46
<transcript>: pascal

01:01:51
<transcript>: Pascal zim, a compiler made by Brazilian. It was fun. That sounds fun.

01:01:53
earholesmcgee: Do you think youll ever do a dev hour with Prime?

01:01:55
nzlaura: @thdxr and now you can git clone twitter!

01:01:57
<transcript>: Neither not reading chat on YouTube. Coming to twitch. Overlay. Yeah. If you're on YouTube, just come over to twitch. That's where we're hanging out.

01:01:57
<transcript>: i'll pull up ch

01:02:02
<transcript>: I'll pull up chat and see if anyone say anything. Nobody say anything on YouTube. We're good.

01:02:02
<transcript>: no

01:02:04
<transcript>: No harm, no foul.

01:02:04
<transcript>: you can do

01:02:11
tini_turner: @thdxr LUL

01:02:14
<transcript>: You can do whatever it pleases you if you're still here after whatever you say or not, we are your audience or not. Ai sabba. That was a lot of I'm not sure I understood. That was a lot of.

01:02:14
<transcript>: like

01:02:20
<transcript>: Like this or that it's like middle of the road. It was a very centrist take, I think.

01:02:24
<transcript>: Let's see, I'm trying to scroll, I'm just so slow.

01:02:24
<transcript>: thank you

01:02:28
<transcript>: Thank you for putting Tweet stacks into.

01:02:28
<transcript>: my thing

01:02:33
<transcript>: My thing. It's going to go into a little hopper. And when I go to Twitter, time just going to open them all up. It's dangerous.

01:02:39
<transcript>: You guys could probably exploit that somehow. Not a very secure thing to do, I guess.

01:02:52
<transcript>: You should probably use a tomato timer so you can set focus time and chat time. Ten minutes. Coding. Five minutes. Chatting. Yeah, your holes. That's probably a good idea. Someone's told me that I should do that. Pomodoro. Is it called tomato timer.

01:02:57
<transcript>: I'm talking about code. That's right. We're just chatting about code.

01:02:57
<transcript>: we're going to actually do some

01:03:00
<transcript>: We're going to actually do some stuff today.

01:03:02
nzlaura: @BigBandzJosh start something, no matter how small. use it as a way to learn new things. when you're working on something you enjoy it'll come naturally

01:03:03
<transcript>: I said, Every single day, this week.

01:03:03
journey_in_ai: italian translation

01:03:09
earholesmcgee: tomoato timer is the name of the app that uses the pomodoro technique

01:03:14
remarcableqq: pomodoro means tomato

01:03:15
<transcript>: We got something done yesterday. We're getting something done today. Just wait. We learned pascal first when I went to University in Germany in 1991, but I already coded at home before in Basic and C.

01:03:30
<transcript>: Talking about code. Okay, nice. I started with an irc bot. Two. My first language was mirc Script. Whoa. Some of my early programming was with Action script. Anybody ever build a Flash website? Those were fun. Those were good time.

01:03:35
remarcableqq: in spanish

01:03:36
<transcript>: Me. Coop's. New job today. All right, you got a contract for it.

01:03:38
ayoungh: Snap

01:03:41
<transcript>: Funny. I've been working for stat muse for, like eight months. I'm still waiting on my contract.

01:03:43
ayoungh: That was a good time

01:03:44
<transcript>: Wonder what that means.

01:03:49
ayoungh: That got me from design into coding

01:03:51
kryotoboi: Now that's what I can relate to ActionScript SeemsGood

01:03:51
<transcript>: It's not official yet, but I've been there for eight months. I mean, they're paying me. I don't have a contract.

01:04:00
codingrob: oof, I remember that, dodged that but learned ASP classic first.

01:04:06
<transcript>: I'm sort of like, do stuff, figure out the details later, kind of person. So it doesn't bother me, but that's interesting. I've been there a long time, still waiting on that contract. It's busy. We're always busy. Everyone's busy.

01:04:06
<transcript>: i'm

01:04:21
<transcript>: I'm a midlifer switched careers from General it to Dev hard to get a job so far, but doesn't stop me. Spent last couple of years working with vjs and superbase and everything in between. Well, with that attitude, ds Legends, you will go far. Just don't let it stop you as long as it doesn't stop you.

01:04:21
<transcript>: you will be

01:04:25
<transcript>: You will be where you want to be someday. That's how I view it.

01:04:34
<transcript>: Okay. I wrote a markov chain caveman AI bot in it before moving to on to other languages. Oh, that was the irc language.

mecoupz: https://twitter.com/fasc1nate/status/1640900488865492996?s=20

01:04:45
<transcript>: The real answer. Any specific answer almost always depends on the person, their location and personality. Hard to give any definitive answer. Many people to a weird path and got lucky or took a weird path and got lucky. Yeah.

01:04:45
<transcript>: that's my problem

01:04:46
aisebaxp: I didn't mean it the wrong way.... I wanted to say it's your channel and the content you choose is going to be fine as long as you don't switch to hot tube only chatting

01:04:51
<transcript>: That's my problem with wait. Who won? Who won? No, you didn't win. Frag, you stop it.

01:04:51
<transcript>: always get

01:04:51
joostschuur: @bigbandzjosh Solve a small problem that you have with code. That way you're the target audience. Or solve something for friends or people local to you.

01:04:55
<transcript>: Always get me always getting me with the false alarms boy who cried Wolf.

01:04:55
<transcript>: that

01:05:02
<transcript>: That so much of like I feel like my career is so much luck and timing and stuff that just doesn't seem repeatable. But I think.

01:05:02
<transcript>: there's princi

01:05:10
<transcript>: There's principles there like the deliver if you just always deliver however you get in the door deliver be kind.

01:05:10
<transcript>: like those

01:05:15
<transcript>: Like those two. You check those boxes be somebody that's easy to work with.

01:05:15
<transcript>: easy to

01:05:27
<transcript>: Easy to communicate with. A lot of people have given me feedback when I was a consultant that it was nice communicating with me. They had had bad experiences communicating with other developers. They felt like they could just talk with me there's. So.

01:05:27
<transcript>: that i

01:05:31
mecoupz: https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen/status/1640819648751976449?s=20

01:05:36
<transcript>: That. I know there's something to it. I say people skills. I don't know what that actually is. Soft skills. I know that that's helped me in my career.

01:05:36
<transcript>: i think

01:05:37
<transcript>: I think there's something there.

01:05:37
<transcript>: talking about

01:05:44
joostschuur: It actually doesn't matter what the project is or even if you will use it in the end. Learning by doing something concrete is what matters see public.dev)

01:05:47
<transcript>: Talking about jobs. If I build something that would integrate well with status, would you give a chance at an interview? I would love to have someone like you as a boss. That's very kind, lessa.

01:05:55
fryday444: Get really good about explaining complex technical concepts to non-technical people.

01:06:05
<transcript>: Long term, what we want to do at statues is create a more open Dev culture and have a lot of open source stuff and work more with people who are passionate about this stuff and hopefully by doing all that attract people like you to want to work at statues because we do need to hire and we do need to figure out.

01:06:05
<transcript>: kind of

01:06:10
<transcript>: Kind of like what our organization is going to look like just a little history lesson.

01:06:10
<transcript>: statues

01:06:20
looch94: laikenGiggle

01:06:28
joostschuur: 'Adam was very high res and had nice bookeh. 10/10, would recommend'

01:06:30
<transcript>: Statues. We've been around for eight years after we raised our Series A. We hired, like, 20 people just immediately. So we raised 10 million. And just like, hired people. And at one point, we were 2025 people at Sat muse, and we just weren't set up to do that. Me and my co founder had no experience running a startup or managing people that much. Neither.

01:06:30
<transcript>: one of us

01:06:36
<transcript>: One of us had really managed people not outside of, like a few people undressed in our career.

01:06:54
<transcript>: So it was kind of like just playing startup. I mean, you just have a lot of money and you're like, we should hire people. It'll make us go faster. It didn't. It just kind of like, confused us. And just, like, muddyed the vision of what we're trying to do. So don't hire too fast. It's just a little lesson. Everyone says that, I guess.

01:06:54
<transcript>: but

01:07:13
<transcript>: But now we're a much smaller organization and still trying to kind of like, figure out how many do we need? How many engineers do we need? How many other types of people do we need working in the community and just sort of like, managing all the other things that stat muse is. So we're not like hiring right this second, but we want to equip ourselves.

01:07:13
<transcript>: to

01:07:19
<transcript>: To grow in a healthy way. And so all that to answer your question, Lisa.

01:07:19
<transcript>: yeah i think

01:07:23
stroopwafel26: hire me

01:07:29
<transcript>: Yeah. I think building something that would be great with sat me is or just building anything that illustrates you're competent at building things is a great way to get my attention and hanging out here in Twitch.

01:07:29
<transcript>: it's kind of the

01:07:32
<transcript>: It's kind of the world works. It's an advantage.

01:07:32
<transcript>: i would be more likely to want to

01:07:36
kryotoboi: Will there be position for people who sit in the office and watch AdamDotDev streams ?

01:07:38
<transcript>: I would be more likely to want to hire somebody that I hang out with on twitch if they've proved that they would be helpful and that they would be a great teammate.

01:07:46
<transcript>: Yeah. So it's who you know, that whole thing. So keep hanging out with me. Not like that sounded cringy. I'm not trying to.

01:07:57
joostschuur: 10 million would mean we could have the chance to win a MacBook at like 1:10. Just saying.

01:08:06
<transcript>: Create new friends by dangling a job because I have no idea if and when we'll ever hire. So I'm not doing that. I take it back. Don't hang out with me thinking you're going to get a job, but it's just the reality is when we start hiring engineers, this is going to be a great Avenue towards that. Just like I'm hanging out with engineers all day. I know a lot of them now that kind of thing. Okay, I'm going to stop.

01:08:06
<transcript>: talking

01:08:14
<transcript>: Talking. Can you send me the site to make the autistic test? Oh, who had that? I don't even know. Somebody sent it to me in Chat. I don't know what it was now.

01:08:16
earholesmcgee: I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO!  Should I stay or should i go!

01:08:17

01:08:35
<transcript>: Johnny, Jim, Joe, Johnny, Jim, Joe. Thank you for that follow. You got three first names, sir. Or maybe that's not actually your names. I do forget sometimes that usernames do not have to map to actual names like Log Catweb. Your name is probably not Log catweb.

stroopwafel26: @mecoupz i think @thdxr trolls harder

01:08:48
<transcript>: People pay some Tweets. That's awesome. We'll do Twitter time soon. Pomodoro means Tomato learn something new. Welcome to Chat, remark.

01:08:51
<transcript>: Remarkable.

01:08:57
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Thank you for that tidbit. Remember when you built a Twitter clone? I did.

01:09:01
<transcript>: I say like it'd be dumb to build a Twitter clin. I did. I said that.

oleksii_lisovyi: Heyo 0/

kryotoboi: My passport says Kryotoboi NotLikeThis

01:09:10
<transcript>: I didn't finish it, though. At least I didn't finish it. And that's my point. If you're just building something to build it, you probably won't finish it.

<transcript>: That's my biggest struggle as the first year. I don't want to just build to build. I want to make something I'll use find it so hard to just make something to make it. Yes, I think anyone would. You don't have the motivation to push through it. Also, reading that message, I'm realizing how long ago I said that and that's how far behind I am in chat. Why do you guys keep watching? Why are you here? Honestly.

01:09:34
oleksii_lisovyi: Hey Adam and people out there and AI bots and everyone

01:09:39
<transcript>: I get like, ten minutes behind on chat. And I'll just start talking about something for another ten minutes. And then I'm 20 minutes behind. What are we even doing here.

01:09:39
<transcript>: do you

01:09:44
mecoupz: we also dont know why we are here

<transcript>: Do you think you'll ever do a dev hour with prime? I don't know what your holes that's up to prime. I am a big fan of primes big fan and have gotten to know him a little bit just through the Twitter dms and wherever else.

01:09:54
<transcript>: yeah i would love

01:10:02
overra_dev: Patti! Patti! Patti!

01:10:14
<transcript>: As someone who's I don't have a lot of takes. I'm not a very technical take kind of guy. I'm not like, oh, look at Tyskrip and it's new feature. It's so dumb. I don't know. I just don't know anything about that stuff, but maybe just stay tuned. We'll see.

01:10:14
<transcript>: now

01:10:17
<transcript>: Now you can get clone Twitter. Yeah, exactly.

01:10:17
<transcript>: it's open sou

01:10:21
<transcript>: It's open source, is it they actually do it. Did they make the thing open source.

01:10:21
<transcript>: start something

01:10:24
earholesmcgee: I would love for you to bring your business/product mind to the Dev hour with Prime. It would be pretty cool

01:10:28
<transcript>: Start something no matter how small, uses a way to learn new things. When you're working on something, you'll enjoy it'll come naturally. I totally agree with that.

01:10:41
<transcript>: Tomato timer is the name of the app that uses pomodoro technique. So it's Italian. Oh, in Spanish. Okay, Snap, that was a good time. That got me from design into coding. Oh, Snap, you worked at snap.

01:10:41
<transcript>: is that what you're

01:10:47
overra_dev: @joostschuur is this supposed to come up?

01:10:54
<transcript>: Is that what you're saying? That's what I can relate to action script. Wow. So long ago that I said action script. Oh, jeez. Okay. Should I just scroll? Why can't I do it? What is my psychological hang up with? Skipping over messages.

01:11:03
<transcript>: I did it. Is patty here? I see a lot of patty, patty, patties.

01:11:05
<transcript>: Patty Here. I'm scrolling.

01:11:07

01:11:20
<transcript>: Adam was very high res and had nice boca 1010 would recommend what.

01:11:30
<transcript>: Will there be a position for people who sit in the office and watch Adam dev Streams cryo? I wish I could pay people.

01:11:30

01:11:33
<transcript>: To just be here every time I stream.

01:11:33
<transcript>: that

01:11:35
<transcript>: That would be nice because.

01:11:35
<transcript>: i would feel like

01:11:44
<transcript>: I would feel like I would feel less bad about wasting your time because I feel like I distract people sometimes and I'm distracting myself. And if there were like a financial arrangement.

01:11:44
<transcript>: i would feel

01:11:46
<transcript>: I would feel a little better about it.

01:11:46
<transcript>: i just

01:11:56
<transcript>: I just don't have the resources to pay all of you. All of you people. 10 million would mean we could have the chance to win a macbook at like one to ten. Just saying 10 million. What.

01:11:57
joostschuur: @overra_dev Which 'this'? Shoulda used an arrow function (or not?)

01:12:01

01:12:02
oleksii_lisovyi: @adamdotdev so no annoying "YOU, UNLUCKY LOOSER DID NOT WANT AGAIN"

01:13:02
<transcript>: Okay. I would love for you to bring your business product mind to the Dev hour with prime. It would be pretty cool. Hey, I'd have fun. I would have fun. Hang out with prime. So here you go. Prime.

overra_dev: @joostschuur lol almost lost me on this one

01:13:21
<transcript>: I wish I could walk to do errands in the ozarks. You have to drive like 20 minutes to everything. I'm literally like 20 minutes from civilization at all times.

01:14:01
<transcript>: You do not waste our time. We are here to watch some nice content and we hope that we make your day as well, at least as much as we can. You do you make my day? This is why I do it. It's for hanging out with you guys. Let's see.

01:14:04
<transcript>: Here. Where is the response.

01:14:04
<transcript>: did i not respond

01:14:06
<transcript>: Did I not respond to something.

01:14:06
<transcript>: oh what

<transcript>: oh

01:14:12
<transcript>: Oh, I don't give you.

01:14:12

kodder: no win for you!

01:14:30
<transcript>: Let's actually do stuff. Let's do stuff. It's time to do stuff. Do you ever do fan code challenge battles? I've never done that. Sounds fun.

01:14:30

01:14:56
<transcript>: Php win? I don't know. Did dax get red pilled? Blue pilled. Whatever it is into writing PHP yesterday. Actually, you only write PHP. I keep asking dax things because I want to know if he's here. He's not here.

01:15:01
<transcript>: All right.

01:15:01
<transcript>: here

01:15:03

<transcript>: We're in Android studio let's run this thing quiz demo run. Can I just make changes.

01:15:21
overra_dev: php on the edge, network and devices

01:15:26
<transcript>: And it'll just update in real time. If I change the url to a new stream. Url, that's what we're going to do. We're going to actually connect to the actual ivs stream. But first we're going to make some aesthetic changes because I always start with aesthetics. Like always, I only care about aesthetics. Basically.

01:15:29
<transcript>: Dax is now a full time layer of L developer.

01:15:29
<transcript>: interesting

01:15:33
<transcript>: Interesting red pilled, hard.

01:15:33
oleksii_lisovyi: Embedded PHP

01:15:35
<transcript>: Red pilled, hard.

01:15:35
<transcript>: okay

01:15:45
overra_dev: surgically embedded php

01:15:52
<transcript>: Okay, here we are. We've got our ui. I don't like how they're taking a landscape video and putting it in the middle of the screen. We're going to make it portrait, and we're just going to crop the edges. So how am I going to do that? Let's see. Quiz, demo, java, all that stuff.

01:15:55
<transcript>: Activities common.

01:15:59
<transcript>: Oh, jeez, I don't have Neil vim.

01:15:59
<transcript>: this

01:16:02
<transcript>: This Android Studio thing. It's going to be tough.

01:16:02
<transcript>: app

01:16:04
overra_dev: neuralphp

01:16:05
<transcript>: App. Let's open app and see what's in there.

01:16:05
<transcript>: okay

01:16:09
<transcript>: Okay Component dagger Injectioncomponent builder.

01:16:09
<transcript>: injection

01:16:11
<transcript>: Injection module.

01:16:11
<transcript>: injection

01:16:14
funkysetiz: good luck

01:16:16
<transcript>: Injection module context. This build what in the world am I looking at.

01:16:20
<transcript>: Why is this so much harder than web Dev.

01:16:20
<transcript>: you

mono_nz: look at the readme Line 33 =P

01:16:24
nzlaura: LOL

01:16:25
overra_dev: all i hear is `echo`

01:16:29
<transcript>: You native developers, your big brain. How do you even fit in the door or something? How do you go through a door with that big brain? There it is. There was a joke.

01:16:35
fearmygaze: i think there is a plugin for vim keybinds

01:16:38
<transcript>: After yesterday's DAX stream I run on PHP now oh, boy, did he blue pilled, everybody, blue pilled, everybody.

01:16:39
overra_dev: how you do with brain?

01:16:45
<transcript>: There is a plugin for vim keyboard. Somebody told me that.

01:16:56
andreaslorozco: hey morning y'all

01:16:59
oleksii_lisovyi: @adamdotdev you should be able to install IdeaVim?

01:17:00
<transcript>: Fear, but my problem with that is I don't want to get comfy. I don't want to settle into Android studio. I'm in here to accomplish something and get out. You know what I mean? I don't want to be like making this developer experience slightly better because I might stick around. No.

01:17:00
<transcript>: we're not stick

01:17:03
<transcript>: We're not sticking around in Android studio.

01:17:07
<transcript>: Idea? Vim. Good Morning, Andrea.

01:17:11
<transcript>: How you do with brain? Is that what I said.

01:17:18
<transcript>: How do you walk through a door with that big brain? You native developers, okay, I don't want this thing flashing. Let's get rid of that.

01:17:18
<transcript>: we're going to

01:17:20
<transcript>: We're going to make this a little smaller.

01:17:20
<transcript>: i'm getting

01:17:23
<transcript>: I'm getting comfy. I'm doing it.

01:17:23
<transcript>: so

01:17:31
<transcript>: So I've got my emulator here. That's nice. It's just built straight in. Feels good. We're importing much stuff.

01:17:31
<transcript>: and then let's see

01:17:36
<transcript>: And then let's see what these are. Injection module. What in the world.

01:17:36
<transcript>: what is

01:17:41
<transcript>: What is this stuff? Like, what kind of name is dagger Injection component.

01:17:41
<transcript>: dagger

01:17:43
<transcript>: Dagger Injection component.

01:17:48
<transcript>: I cannot ground that in reality. What could that be referring to.

01:17:48
<transcript>: a dagger

01:17:53
overra_dev: rofl java junkies

01:17:54
<transcript>: A dagger. I know what daggers are. They're like, little swords. Injections. I know what those are.

01:17:54
<transcript>: what is a

01:17:57
<transcript>: What is a dagger injection component.

01:17:57
<transcript>: i'm

01:17:59
oleksii_lisovyi: I have that on PHPStorm ‚Äì another JetBrains product

01:17:59
tini_turner: dependency injection

01:17:59
nzlaura: dependency injection

01:18:00
<transcript>: I'm sorry. I don't understand.

01:18:05
tini_turner: with dagger

01:18:05
funkysetiz: dagger is a lib for Android

01:18:07
<transcript>: Quiz demo injection is like a namespace. Okay, let's go to injection injection component. Here we are.

01:18:07
<transcript>: function

01:18:08
kryotoboi: Wow  android dev has become quite violent  üíâ üó°

01:18:10
<transcript>: Function inject.

01:18:11
<transcript>: Okay.

01:18:11
<transcript>: is this

01:18:13
fearmygaze: Dagger Hilt is an injection library

01:18:13
oleksii_lisovyi: OOP

01:18:15
<transcript>: Is this using jetpack? Is this the jetpack thing.

01:18:16
aj_stuyvenberg: must be the ides of march, ya?

01:18:19
mono_nz: The readme gives a vertical video link btw

01:18:19
<transcript>: Jetpack, composer or whatever somebody said yesterday.

01:18:19
<transcript>: dagger

01:18:24
nzlaura: no

01:18:25
earholesmcgee: As someone with a fear of needles "Dagger Injection" sounds like a nightmare

01:18:25
<transcript>: Dagger hilt is an injection library. Okay, dagger hilt.

01:18:27
<transcript>: Whoo.

01:18:30
<transcript>: This is something.

01:18:38
<transcript>: It's the pendency injection. Okay, I remember dependency injection from my net days. I used to use unity.

01:18:39
<transcript>: It's.

01:18:39
<transcript>: a container thing

01:18:41
<transcript>: A container thing.

01:18:41
<transcript>: dependency

01:18:47
<transcript>: Dependency injection container. I swear I only used it because I felt so smart saying that I used it.

01:18:47
<transcript>: i can just

01:18:50
<transcript>: I can just define my constructor and stuff will magically appear.

01:18:50
<transcript>: from my

01:18:53
<transcript>: From my dependency injection container.

01:18:53
<transcript>: i don't know

01:18:55
<transcript>: I don't know. Is this stuff necessary.

01:18:55
<transcript>: i feel like

01:19:00
<transcript>: I feel like we've moved on in web dev. We decided all that stuff is not necessary.

01:19:00
<transcript>: do people

01:19:01
kryotoboi: Good ol days of android dev on Eclipse  CoolStoryBob

01:19:02
oleksii_lisovyi: I feel ya sweating already Adam

01:19:03
<transcript>: Do people still do that in web Dev.

01:19:06
nzlaura: haha whaaat, you can use dep inj in node and webdev

01:19:09
nzlaura: yes it's a thing!

01:19:09
<transcript>: Have I just gone completely soy Dev JavaScript front end and I don't remember anything about anything else.

01:19:13
schrew: Angular loves some dependency injection

01:19:14
tini_turner: angular

01:19:16
nzlaura: makes testing so much easier

01:19:18
<transcript>: You feel me sweating? I am sweating.

01:19:18
<transcript>: you can use

01:19:23
<transcript>: You can use dependency injection and node and web dev. Do people do it though? Do people actually do it.

01:19:28
<transcript>: Angular loves dependency ejection okay interesting.

01:19:32
nzlaura: if you are a rigourous tester, yes

01:19:38
<transcript>: The readme gives a vertical video link, by the way. Oh, the readme on this thing that I'm looking at right now, where is the readme? Is there a readme? Wait, what.

01:19:38
<transcript>: what

01:19:41
<transcript>: What is Android doing here.

01:19:41
<transcript>: project

01:19:47
<transcript>: Project I want to see, like an actual there we go. Read me. You're telling me there's a vertical.

01:19:54
<transcript>: Vertical, oh, vertical video? Oh, Here we go.

01:19:54
<transcript>: so

01:19:57
<transcript>: So I can use this instead.

01:20:05
oleksii_lisovyi: It's all over Adam, you live in your JS bubble ;p

01:20:06
<transcript>: Okay, how would I find where it's using? Okay, but it needs to be the quiz. I'm just going to crop it.

01:20:06
<transcript>: no matter

01:20:07
<transcript>: No matter.

01:20:07
<transcript>: what size

01:20:12
juniornascm: DI is the default for .NET webapis   you inject services into controllers, repositories into services and database context in repositories

01:20:15
rodneypk: Dependency injection is still definitely a thing in web dev.

01:20:23
<transcript>: What size of video you stream here? We're going to make the height, set the device height, and then we're going to say crop off the sides. I'm only going to stream a portrait orientation when I stream to rebase, so it doesn't matter. But for purposes of making this look better right now, that's what we're going to do.

01:20:31
<transcript>: Di is the default for net. Web apis. You inject services into controllers, repositories into services and database context into repositories.

01:20:31
<transcript>: whoo i

01:20:34
<transcript>: Whoo I Live in the js bubble.

01:20:35
andreaslorozco: is the bot not replying now when we don't win the macbook?

01:20:36
<transcript>: Okay.

01:20:40
<transcript>: The pinion selection is still a thing.

01:20:45
<transcript>: Definitely a thing in web dev. Okay.

01:20:45
<transcript>: no

01:20:46
nzlaura: @juniornascm i mean that's one implementation

01:20:49
<transcript>: No, it does not. Andrea. It does not tell you if you lose.

01:20:49
<transcript>: i mean if you

01:20:51
<transcript>: I mean if you don't win.

01:20:54
<transcript>: Sorry losing was so harsh.

01:20:54
<transcript>: main

01:21:00
<transcript>: Main activity. So we're going to go to activities. I don't really understand the idea of activities as a metaphor.

01:21:17
nzlaura: activity is a screen, fragments are components of a screen

01:21:19
<transcript>: Why are activities like interfaces? I don't understand that entirely. When I think of an activity, I do not think of like a component. And it seems like they're used as a component. Maybe. I don't know. Am I totally missing the point? Am I missing the point? It's fine.

01:21:19
<transcript>: activity

01:21:23
nzlaura: essentially

01:21:29
<transcript>: Activity is a screen fragments or components of a screen. Okay, I'm so glad I have twitch chat here to make any of this make sense. Thank you so much. Nz Laura, for the tips.

01:21:36
juniornascm: twitch chat > chat gpt

01:21:37
nzlaura: am ex android dev hah

01:21:37
earholesmcgee: "We have so much room now for activities!" ~ Step Brothers

01:21:52
<transcript>: So if dependency injection is still definitely a thing in web dev. And all I do is web dev. Does that mean I'm just like living in a world of very simple projects, and I've never felt the need to use dependency injection. That might be it. It might just be that I work on very simple things.

01:21:53
blackspy01: what terminal theme do you use

01:22:03
oleksii_lisovyi: @juniornascm chat gpt is injected into twitch chat

01:22:06
<transcript>: Twitch chat greater than Chat gbt. Honestly, I probably rely on twitch chat more than any other tool in my Arsenal. Software development. Okay, so here we are. This is our main activity.

01:22:07
juniornascm: @juniornascm i cloud be wrong but the examples of web api in the docs uses DI, that way i said default

01:22:09
<transcript>: Answer, adapter.

01:22:09
<transcript>: it's just so much

01:22:12
juniornascm: sorry if this is wrong

01:22:19
<transcript>: It's just so much indirection. It feels so like I have an adapter that hits my repository, that the View model can ingest. I don't know. It just feels like a lot.

01:22:19
aj_stuyvenberg: It's more useful if you have many many people working on the same project at the same time. Makes refactors easier with concurrent, ongoing development.

01:22:28
<transcript>: Bottom sheet behavior. A sheet. Okay, sheet. Sounds more like a ui paradigm that I could understand.

01:22:32
<transcript>: On Create App component inject this.

01:22:40
<transcript>: Is like derived from another thing. Of course.

01:22:40
<transcript>: okay

01:22:41
<transcript>: Okay, awesome.

01:22:41
<transcript>: this all

01:22:44
<transcript>: This all sucks so bad.

01:22:52
smilingbig: gotta abstract all the things

01:22:53
<transcript>: Sorry I'm being very dismissive of what's a fine technology. I'm sure it just feels like such a far cry from the world I live in and web Dev.

01:22:58
<transcript>: So.

01:22:58
<transcript>: the tea bag

01:23:03
<transcript>: The tea bag is making it where I can't get the last of my drink and I'm not happy about it.

01:23:05
oleksii_lisovyi: Extensibility thingy

01:23:08
stroopwafel26: @blackspy01 dracula

01:23:09
<transcript>: That'll have to do.

01:23:10
averydeliciouscake: Object oriented hell lol

01:23:11
<transcript>: We'll have to do.

01:23:11
<transcript>: okay

01:23:13
<transcript>: Okay, let's see.

01:23:24
metajezza: Uhm. You keep the teabag in the whole time you drink ?

01:23:25
<transcript>: It's more useful if you have many people working on the same project at the same time. Makes refactors easier with concurrent, ongoing development. Oh, that's what it is. I only work alone. That's what it is.

01:23:25
<transcript>: i work

01:23:28
<transcript>: I work alone, so I don't need all of this indirection.

01:23:31
<transcript>: And.

01:23:31
<transcript>: all the

01:23:41
oleksii_lisovyi: OOPizm

01:23:42
<transcript>: All the polymorphism and whatever else is going on. I don't need design patterns because I work alone, and it all just fits in my brain. My small brain.

01:23:42
<transcript>: so

01:23:48
<transcript>: So let's see fit, surface to view. We got to find the spot where the video.

01:23:48
<transcript>: is

01:23:51
<transcript>: Is rendered. Where. Let's see.

01:23:51
<transcript>: is there

01:23:53
<transcript>: Is there like.

01:23:53
<transcript>: a

01:24:01
<transcript>: A component or an activity for the video itself. Let's see ivs player.

01:24:04
smilingbig: I'm not sure if that's the case honestly LUL

01:24:18
<transcript>: On Create Data Binding util Set Content View Activity Main binding.

01:24:18
<transcript>: so it's like a

01:24:20
<transcript>: So it's like a generic R layout.

01:24:23
<transcript>: Activity main.

01:24:24
<transcript>: Okay.

01:24:24
<transcript>: life

01:24:27
<transcript>: Lifecycle owner.

01:24:31
<transcript>: This is so much to take in at once.

01:24:31

<transcript>: Surface viewholder surface.

01:24:52
br4hmm: Hey Adam, how is your day?

01:25:02
nzlaura: this uses MVVM so you should see the jetpack code in a video player view and view model. although there's only a main view model so i guess this app is just super simplistic

01:25:04
<transcript>: This is something meta. Jezza, you keep the T bag in the whole time you drink. I did today. Is it bad? Are you not supposed to do that? Is that like a carcinogen or something.

01:25:11
<transcript>: Am I going to die? Just give me the truth. Give me the honest truth dark side thank you so much for that. Follow.

01:25:18
stroopwafel26: everyone's gonna die

01:25:19
<transcript>: Brahm. Welcome to Chat. My day is going great. How's your day, Bram.

01:25:20
<transcript>: I'm.

01:25:20
<transcript>: interpreting

thdxr: my indoor cat got out again :(

01:25:24
earholesmcgee: damn, adam dying from being T-bagged rip

01:25:36
smilingbig: I like leaving teabag in all the time personally

01:25:39
<transcript>: Black Spy. Welcome to Chat dracula. I think somebody answered you.

01:25:39
<transcript>: object

01:25:44
<transcript>: Object oriented hell. So true. I really don't enjoy this. I'm not having fun.

01:25:59
<transcript>: In the kotlin world, it uses mvvm Model View Model O the good old days of wpf development so you should see the jetback code in a video player view and view model, although there's only a main view model. So I guess this app is just super simple.

01:25:59
<transcript>: this

01:26:01
<transcript>: This is super simplistic.

01:26:15
<transcript>: Dax, your indoor cat got out again. Oh, no, she's under the house, refusing to come out. Oh, no, dax, what do you do? Call the Fire Department. Don't they get cats from places.

01:26:19
br4hmm: I'm good (Ibrahim he/him usually called hima but whatever you like), If you don't mind asking, I'm trying to get into software engineering, do you think gaming and anime (while you are learning to code)  are waste of time?

01:26:26
<transcript>: Don't they? Isn't that a thing? I just think it's a very strong cup of tea. Nothing bad. Yeah. Well, it was the part that had the caffeine in it. So I was trying to get every bit out of it. I'm good. Ibrahim.

01:26:27
thdxr: lol I setup a camera and left food out, hopefully she knows to come back in

01:26:28

thdxr: left the door open

01:26:34
<transcript>: Called hima, but whatever you like, if you don't mind asking, I'm trying to get into software engineering. Do you think.

01:26:34
<transcript>: gaming

01:26:39
<transcript>: Gaming and anime while you are learning to code, are waste of time.

01:26:44
metajezza: @thdxr does treats not work getting her to follow you ?

01:26:48
<transcript>: I don't think hobbies are a waste of time. Those sound like hobbies. Gaming is definitely a hobby. I think anime is a hobby, although I'm not sure.

01:26:48
<transcript>: i do

01:26:53
<transcript>: I do know that waifus waifus are a thing. I've learned that on Twitter.

01:26:53
<transcript>: wif

01:26:55
thdxr: not when she's freaked out

01:27:00
<transcript>: Wif so I believe anime is also a hobby. Hobbies are not a waste of time.

01:27:00
<transcript>: it's just about

01:27:08
<transcript>: It's just about balancing, like, don't get in a rut where all you do is game, because I've been there and I've been very addicted to video games.

01:27:08
<transcript>: so

01:27:12
metajezza: Oh :( hope she comes soon

01:27:26
<transcript>: So if it's something like you can't stop doing it and you're not actually working towards your goals, that's a problem. Otherwise, hobbies are great. They keep you balanced. Life is spice or something. Spice of life. I don't know. Something about variety. Is this the spice of life? That's it? Variety is the spice of life. That's literally the saying, not something about it.

01:27:26
<transcript>: let's see

01:27:27
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:27:27
<transcript>: i

01:27:28
liquidor: Unless your software is a game :P

01:27:29
alfredguimaz: R u using compose?

01:27:32
br4hmm: Thank you for sharing your thoughts, sorry if i was a distraction

01:27:33
<transcript>: I set up a camera and left food out. Hopefully she knows to come back in. Let the door open, man.

01:27:33
<transcript>: that

01:27:34
<transcript>: That sucks. Dax.

01:27:36
mph1989: Regarding Tea vs Coffee and teeth stains. Tea can in many cases contain a much higher volume of chromogens, tannins and acids, than coffee. Which literally erodes the enamel on the teeth.

01:27:37
kryotoboi: Why does google end up over complicating dev environments/libraries ?

01:27:39
<transcript>: Does treats not work. Getting her to follow you. Not when she's freaked out, man.

01:27:44
<transcript>: Yeah, good luck with that, dax. Hope your cat comes back in.

01:27:49
<transcript>: Are you using compose? Is that jetpack? Alfred? I think I am.

01:27:52
<transcript>: I think so.

01:27:55
oleksii_lisovyi: The thing is that you get good at things you do. So... if you play you get good at gaming. Same for programming or anything else

01:28:08
br4hmm: You are so sweet

01:28:12
<transcript>: Never a distraction, brahm or Ibrahim. Never a distraction because I'm literally here just to talk to you. I'm just here to talk to you people. That's the only reason I even stream. If I wanted to just get stuff done, I would not stream. That's what I do when I'm not streaming as I get stuff done. But when I'm streaming, I'm here to hang out. Inception. Thank you for that. Follow.

01:28:12
<transcript>: also

01:28:13
<transcript>: Also.

01:28:13
<transcript>: abraham

01:28:17
nzlaura: gaming is usually a gateway to writing scripts, i saw this a lot with the guys i studied with at uni

01:28:27
<transcript>: Abraham. Thank you for that. Follow. I don't know if I'm saying it right. I'm such an American. Like when I speak. I just know every name. It's impossible for me to pronounce a name, right? And I'm sorry for that. I really mean to. I mean to speak your name correctly.

01:28:27
<transcript>: to

01:28:33
<transcript>: To pronounce it correctly. Why does Google end up overcomplicating Dev environments in libraries.

01:28:33
<transcript>: yeah

01:28:34
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:28:34
<transcript>: this just

01:28:38
br4hmm: I know my name is hard to spell that's why I told you to call me hima (he maa)

01:28:42
<transcript>: This just makes it hurts my soul, really? This whole project just it hurts it hurts me there is a chance.

01:28:42
<transcript>: there is a chance

01:28:43
br4hmm: or whatever you want

01:28:47
<transcript>: There is a chance that this is aws putting their spin on how to do.

01:28:47
<transcript>: how to organize

01:28:49
<transcript>: How to organize.

01:28:49
<transcript>: a kotlin

01:28:54
<transcript>: A kotlin app because aws, in my experience not the best at organizing.

01:28:54
<transcript>: their

01:28:58
nzlaura: who wrote those app? it's pretty terrible lmao

01:29:09
<transcript>: Their non native projects, like when they build something for them and java. I'm sure they organize it great when they build a job script library. Not so great. Maybe. Does that make sense? So maybe they're just mad at this. I'm going to throw that out there as a possibility.

01:29:19
<transcript>: I know my name is hard to spell. That's why I told you to call me Hema. Kima. Got it. He can. I can do that. Hema.

01:29:19
<transcript>: the the

01:29:23
alfredguimaz: would you say this is harder than web dev?

01:29:28
br4hmm: 4 is for A

01:29:30
mecoupz: i'm still for a simple webview and a astro/nextjs page :D

01:29:34
<transcript>: The the number of, like, the map in my brain. Like if it were like if it were like a javascript map, it's getting larger and larger of names that I see it in chat and I translate it to something completely different. Like, I see Yeltra and I know it's heart gene. I see.

01:29:34
<transcript>: d

01:29:36
<transcript>: D.

01:29:36
<transcript>: dm

01:29:39
<transcript>: Dmd and I know it's diamond? I see.

01:29:42
<transcript>: seem and

01:29:42
<transcript>: seem and i know

01:29:43
<transcript>: Seem and I know.

01:29:43
<transcript>: that's

01:29:44
thdxr: thdxr

01:29:48
smilingbig: I got nice easy name for you

01:29:50
<transcript>: That's hima. Now. I know that now. And I see thdxr and I know it's thdxr.

01:29:51
smilingbig: LUL

01:29:54
<transcript>: Let's see who wrote those apps? Pretty terrible.

01:30:00
<transcript>: This app is this is written by aws. It's an aws. Example.

01:30:13
thdxr: should we make it open source and have twitch fix eveyrthing for us

01:30:14
<transcript>: Regarding tea versus coffee and teeth stains, tcan in many cases contain a much higher volume of chromogens, tannins, and acids than coffee, which literally erodes the enamel of the teeth. Oh, no.

01:30:14
<transcript>: that

01:30:21
<transcript>: That reminds me every time I have something like tea and coffee and whatever else. And kombucha I got to drink some water afterward.

01:30:32
<transcript>: Got to get that stuff off my teeth. I don't want it to erode. My enamel.

01:30:32
<transcript>: gam

01:30:38
<transcript>: Gaming is usually a gateway to writing scripts. I saw this a lot with the guys I studied with at uni.

01:30:43
<transcript>: Yeah. A lot of people get into game dev, and that leads into building stuff.

01:30:58
<transcript>: Okay. Would you say this is harder than web Dev? It's less familiar. That's for sure. I enjoy web Dev. I think it's much simpler than this. Or it can be. At least I guess you could make web Dev this complicated. But, man, this is something.

01:31:05
<transcript>: Four is for a I'm still for a simple web view and an astro Next jazz page. Yeah. This makes astro feel like.

01:31:07
<transcript>: I'm.

01:31:07
<transcript>: writing

01:31:10
<transcript>: Writing like I'm a toddler, and I can.

01:31:10
<transcript>: like a tod

01:31:10
johnnyjimjoe: I am the complete opposite. I find this more natural to me.

01:31:16
<transcript>: Like a toddler could understand how to write an Astro app. I think compared to this, this is big brain stuff.

01:31:21
oleksii_lisovyi: Adam got OOPeed

01:31:32
<transcript>: Okay. Smiling Big. Very easy name. Very easy for me to read. Smiling Big. It also kind of makes me smile every time I read your name. Adam oop. Should we make it open source and have twitch fix everything for us? Yes. There you go.

01:31:32
<transcript>: well i'll just

01:31:34
smilingbig: good <3

01:31:43
<transcript>: Well, I'll just put something together that works. And then twitch chat can come in and make it good. How about that? You guys make it good. I'm just going to get something working. So we got to find.

01:31:46
oleksii_lisovyi: Easy money

01:31:47
kryotoboi: Yes please

01:31:49
<transcript>: Adapters and dialogues. I'm trying to find the ivs.

01:31:49
<transcript>: actual

01:31:51
<transcript>: Actual player.

01:31:51
<transcript>: let's see

01:31:52
<transcript>: Let's see.

01:32:02
<transcript>: I don't even know how to find. Is this find all okay, that's how it works.

01:32:05
<transcript>: Player. Here we go.

01:32:05
<transcript>: main activ

01:32:06
<transcript>: Main activity.

01:32:14
<transcript>: Has a IBS player import. So this is where the actual player view. Here we go. Look at me. I just want something.

01:32:14
<transcript>: this

01:32:19
<transcript>: This is basic playback. Oh, that's the wrong one. I don't want basic playback.

01:32:23
<transcript>: Okay, let's try again. Attempt number two.

01:32:23
<transcript>: in project

01:32:28
<transcript>: In project module. Oh, these are modules. No.

01:32:28
<transcript>: directory

01:32:33
<transcript>: Directory. Let's search inside of the quiz demo directory. Yes.

01:32:33
<transcript>: yes

01:32:34
<transcript>: Yes.

01:32:34
<transcript>: okay

01:32:36
<transcript>: Okay. Nowhere does it import.

01:32:36
<transcript>: the play

01:32:39
<transcript>: The player stuff interesting.

01:32:39
<transcript>: it must be

01:32:42
<transcript>: It must be like a common is there a common.

01:32:46
<transcript>: What is going on here? Project.

01:32:48
<transcript>: We have our.

01:32:55
<transcript>: Custom ui quiz demo Basic playback.

01:32:55
<transcript>: idea

01:32:57
<transcript>: Idea.

01:33:02
<transcript>: Gradle. Okay. There's no common code, I guess.

01:33:08
<transcript>: Generated. What am I looking at? Okay, let's go back to here. Android.

01:33:13
<transcript>: Okay quiz demo.

01:33:15
<transcript>: Java.

01:33:21
<transcript>: So I don't know where it's rendering the actual.

01:33:24
<transcript>: Oh, let's do this. Let's search for.

01:33:27
<transcript>: Url.

01:33:27
nzlaura: open res folder

01:33:33
<transcript>: For M three. Yeah. There we go. Link. Here we go.

01:33:40
thdxr: is this some rtmps stream they have running 24/7?

01:33:41
<transcript>: Link. Where is that at configuration common. So there is a common.

01:33:41
<transcript>: is that common

01:33:41
oleksii_lisovyi: Hm, the issue with open source is that you should know which changes to accept or deny.

01:33:43
<transcript>: Is that common amongst all these.

01:33:48
<transcript>: Is that the same directory in all of them? No different.

01:33:50
<transcript>: Okay.

01:33:52
<transcript>: Configuration.

01:33:52
<transcript>: why am i

01:33:56
<transcript>: Why am I not even opening the files now? Oh, this is too big.

01:33:59
<transcript>: Okay.

01:34:02
thdxr: have a tiny bit of experience with open source

01:34:03
<transcript>: Link so there you go.

01:34:03
<transcript>: player extensions

01:34:04
<transcript>: Player extensions.

01:34:07
<transcript>: Player set listener.

01:34:11
<transcript>: Okay. We're getting somewhere. We're getting there.

01:34:21
<transcript>: Is this some rtmps stream they have running twenty four, seven. I guess so. Dax. Yeah, this thing right here. I guess so. It's just always running.

01:34:24
<transcript>: Which, I guess.

01:34:24
<transcript>: is probably

01:34:28
<transcript>: Is probably not a huge expense for them, but still kind of crazy.

01:34:35
<transcript>: So what am I looking for? I'm looking for? Where do we use live portrait? Oh, portrait.

01:34:35
<transcript>: port

01:35:01
nzlaura: haha update the directory in your search

01:35:02
<transcript>: I don't know how to find how they're used.

01:35:04
oleksii_lisovyi: @adamdotdev right click "Show usages"

<transcript>: What keyboard.

01:36:54
oleksii_lisovyi: @adamdotdev don't you need to turn a device somehow?

01:36:56
<transcript>: Maybe rotate the emulator.

01:36:58
<transcript>: Rotate it.

01:36:58
<transcript>: is this how

01:37:01
<transcript>: Is this how you rotate? Yeah.

01:37:03
<transcript>: Now, what.

01:37:05
thdxr: the keyboard on your desk you're using it wrong

01:37:06
<transcript>: Stream, two.

01:37:06
<transcript>: stream

01:37:07
thdxr: rotate it 180 degrees

01:37:10
<transcript>: Stream one no difference.

01:37:13
<transcript>: Stream, two.

01:37:22
<transcript>: The keyboard on your desk. You're using it wrong. Rotate it 180 degrees. What are you talking about.

01:37:26
<transcript>: You're just trying to mess with me. I know you are.

mattmancodes: hahaha

01:37:31
oleksii_lisovyi: F

01:37:33
<transcript>: Oh, I see you're just trying to get me confused because people are saying, rotate like the device.

01:37:33
<transcript>: i

01:37:34
thdxr: L

01:37:35
<transcript>: I see.

01:37:39

01:37:51
<transcript>: just kidding

01:37:52
<transcript>: Just kidding.

01:37:52
<transcript>: i don't

01:37:57
thdxr: LOL

01:37:57
<transcript>: I don't understand what the portrait thing is all about. Let's go back to this. Go to definition.

01:37:57
fearmygaze: i think you have to make change in the emulator settings

01:38:00
<transcript>: Go.

01:38:00
<transcript>: to

01:38:01
smilingbig: KEKW

01:38:02
overra_dev: jkjk

01:38:04
<transcript>: To declaration or usages. Here we go. Is this the same URL.

01:38:08
<transcript>: 1810. It is it's the same exact URL.

01:38:12
<transcript>: Isn't it? Isn't it.

01:38:12
<transcript>: oh

01:38:16
<transcript>: Oh allow source. True. It's a little different, but it's basically the same.

01:38:16
<transcript>: it's the same

01:38:22
aisebaxp: Gotta go... good luck with portrait mods

01:38:23
<transcript>: It's the same stream. Okay. Cool. So that's pointless. Why did they even do that? I don't understand, but that's fine.

01:38:23
<transcript>: so now

01:38:39
<transcript>: So now I'm a little closer though to let's see if I go back to find usages. I'm a little closer to understanding where this thing is rendered or whatever. What is this? Git sources. Let's find usages of this.

01:38:46
johnnyjimjoe: Might be in "res/layout/main.xml"

01:38:47
<transcript>: Look at me tracking it down? Look at me tracking it down. Get sources. Here we go. A nit Player player is Media player.

01:38:47
<transcript>: on video

01:38:49
<transcript>: On Video Size change.

01:38:49
<transcript>: okay

01:38:51
<transcript>: Okay on.

01:38:51
<transcript>: metad

01:39:00
<transcript>: Metadata. Hey, hey, look at this. People. I know what this is. This is the sdk. I know I've used this media player comes from what am.

01:39:00
<transcript>: ams play

01:39:02
<transcript>: Ams player.

01:39:02
<transcript>: look at

01:39:03
oleksii_lisovyi: @adamdotdev "find usages" can be used on anything, a function, class, interface, variable whatever

01:39:04
<transcript>: Look at us.

01:39:08
nzlaura: Clap

01:39:10
overra_dev: "this is unix, I know this"

01:39:13
<transcript>: Csba, we are doing this. We are doing this. I think you have to make a change in the emulator settings.

01:39:13
<transcript>: find usages

01:39:23
<transcript>: Find usages can be used on anything, a function class interface variable, whatever. Thank you so much, alexi. Very helpful. Might be in rest layout, main XML.

01:39:32
<transcript>: So what I want to do is, I want to say, this player, I'm going to shape it differently. How do I.

01:39:32
<transcript>: determine

01:39:34
<transcript>: Determine how it's shaped.

01:39:34
<transcript>: where is

01:39:37
<transcript>: Where is the rendering of the thing.

01:39:38
<transcript>: Main view model.

01:39:42
<transcript>: So main view model.

01:39:42
<transcript>: where

01:39:44
thdxr: anyone want a ban?

01:39:48
<transcript>: Where does this file? Oops. Where does it live? Show me it show me it in the thing.

01:39:54
<transcript>: Local history? No. Show Me. Where is it.

01:39:54
<transcript>: oh view model

01:39:57
<transcript>: Oh, view models here we go quiz demo, view models.

01:40:07
nzlaura: MainActivity is the view

01:40:08
mecoupz: dax can you ban that adam guy?

01:40:08
<transcript>: I hate architecture and good practices. Someone just give me some bad practices, please. So the main activity is that where the player. Let's see player.

01:40:09
overra_dev: acornEyes

01:40:17
thdxr: I tried banning adam

01:40:17
<transcript>: Player start service view oh, here we go, here we go. I just have no room. I can't see anything.

01:40:19
thdxr: but you can't

01:40:20
<transcript>: All this stuff is okay.

01:40:22
smilingbig: LUL

01:40:22
<transcript>: With.

01:40:22
<transcript>: height

01:40:24
<transcript>: Height.

01:40:24
<transcript>: surfaceview

01:40:26
<transcript>: Surfaceview post.

01:40:26
<transcript>: fit

01:40:30
<transcript>: Fit Service to view. Okay, people, we're getting there.

01:40:30
<transcript>: what

01:40:32
<transcript>: What is this.

01:40:36
<transcript>: Go to.

01:40:47
<transcript>: Fit surface to view. This is where I can change it. Okay, let's just try something. Ratio. Old height, new height. Okay, layout. Params out width, new width plus 100.

01:40:47
<transcript>: try that

01:40:49
<transcript>: Try that.

01:40:49
<transcript>: or new height

01:40:53
<transcript>: Or new height plus 200. I don't know.

01:40:54
<transcript>: Do anything.

01:40:55
smilingbig: can you install plugins in this ide?

01:40:58
<transcript>: To change anything. Will it change anything.

01:41:00
oleksii_lisovyi: @adamdotdev there is a cross on top of project tree which brings you to the file location in the tree

01:41:03
<transcript>: I have to rotate or something.

01:41:05
<transcript>: To trigger a re? I don't know.

01:41:05
<transcript>: when does

01:41:07
<transcript>: When does it call this.

01:41:11
nzlaura: it doesn't hot reload :(

01:41:12
<transcript>: Fine usages. When does it call on create.

01:41:14
metajezza: @smilingbig should be able to,

01:41:19
<transcript>: And init ui. Maybe I need to rerun the app. I bet I need to rerun it. Let's rerun the app.

01:41:21
nzlaura: you'll need to re-run haha yeah

01:41:23
<transcript>: And it should be taller now.

01:41:23
<transcript>: did that work

01:41:24
smilingbig: I wonder if you could add vim bindings

01:41:26
<transcript>: Did that work? Did I rerun it? No.

01:41:26
<transcript>: control

01:41:32
<transcript>: Control. R right, I'll turn on keycaster. Sorry, I've not had it on keycaster.

01:41:37
<transcript>: Terminate. Yes.

01:41:37
<transcript>: launching

01:41:47
<transcript>: Launching again. Here we go. Is it bigger? That's the question. It is. It's out of proportion? Because I did it. I changed something. And I saw.

01:41:47
<transcript>: it do that

01:41:48
nzlaura: WOOOO

01:41:53
<transcript>: It do that. Okay. Fifth surface of use. So now we can do something interesting. We can set the height.

01:41:58
oleksii_lisovyi: Hacker

01:42:00
<transcript>: To the whole device height. I think maybe parent height. Maybe we'll see.

01:42:12
<transcript>: There is a cross on top of projectory which brings you to the file location in the tree. Thank you so much, alexi. You tried banning, but you can't wait. What? Banning. Me? What are you talking about? Can you ban that at him? Guy.

01:42:15
<transcript>: It doesn't hot. Reload.

01:42:15
<transcript>: sad sad

01:42:18
<transcript>: Sad sad story need to rerun okay, fine.

01:42:18
<transcript>: i wonder

01:42:22
<transcript>: I wonder if you could add vim bindings. I could smiling but.

01:42:23
thdxr: back to react native?

01:42:24
johnnyjimjoe: Android views are created in the res folder as xml files. The layouts that is if you're trying to change the sizes of things I believe you need to look there.

01:42:25
<transcript>: My current stance is that I don't want to.

01:42:32
<transcript>: Lean into this environment. I want to just.

01:42:32
<transcript>: get in

01:42:36
<transcript>: Get in and get out back to react native what.

01:42:36
<transcript>: dax

01:42:39
<transcript>: Dax. Why would we go back to React native.

01:42:39
nzlaura: @johnnyjimjoe he's using jetpack, that's the old school way haha

01:42:43
<transcript>: Oh, because it doesn't hire reload. It's fine.

01:42:45
<transcript>: It's fine.

01:42:45
<transcript>: android

01:42:59
<transcript>: Android user created in the rest folder as xml files layouts that if you're trying to stage size things, I believe you need to look there Johnny. Jim Joe. Yeah, we're using jetpack. I don't know what that is, but we're using it. We're using jetpack. Sounds really cool.

01:43:03
metajezza: Thought Kotlin could not reload

01:43:04
johnnyjimjoe: Ohh okay my bad.

01:43:04
thdxr: nzlaura do you want to build this for us for free

01:43:10
thdxr: you sound like you know what you're doing

01:43:12
<transcript>: Like jetpack compose. That's one of the cooler names in Tech that I've ever heard, but I don't know what it is. Service View. Okay, so we're going to say new width. I don't know what the width is supposed to be, but the height I want to be.

01:43:12
<transcript>: the full height

01:43:16
<transcript>: The full height of the thing. So I want to say height.

01:43:16
<transcript>: is

01:43:19
<transcript>: Is let's just say parent.

01:43:21
thdxr: we'll give you 10,000 adam bux

01:43:22
oleksii_lisovyi: @adamdotdev try cross cause you forget, I'm sure KAPPA

01:43:23
<transcript>: Height and act like we know what we're talking about.

01:43:23
<transcript>: i feel like that's

01:43:24
<transcript>: I feel like that's.

01:43:24
<transcript>: not

01:43:27
<transcript>: Not actually what's going to be the right height.

01:43:27
<transcript>: but

01:43:28
nzlaura: hahahaha i haven't touched kotlin for like 6 years

01:43:29
<transcript>: But I'm going to try it.

01:43:29
<transcript>: rerun

01:43:34
<transcript>: Rerun, it is it working? Is it rerunning.

01:43:38
<transcript>: Yeah. Don't ask again. I always want to terminate it.

01:43:42
codingrob: While I would recommend setting this up outside the stream you can use https://github.com/SuduIDE/ideals to use android studio (headless) (I did not test studio) as a neovim lsp source.

01:43:45
mecoupz: @thdxr he'll do it for 10,000,000 adam bucks :P

01:43:50
<transcript>: This seems like a very bad feedback loop. Okay, it works. That's the full height. He's a little skewed. That's not what I'll look like when rebase finally airs sometime in 2025.

01:43:56
thdxr: I think we can make it work

01:44:00
<transcript>: But it worked. Now we just got to set the width. Okay. So we got to calculate the width based on the ratio. So height and width that's our ratio.

01:44:00
<transcript>: width

01:44:03
<transcript>: Width is going to be.

01:44:06
<transcript>: Something like.

01:44:07
overra_dev: how many macbooks is that

01:44:12
<transcript>: If old height to float greater than old width, the float times ratio.

01:44:12
<transcript>: what

01:44:13
<transcript>: What.

01:44:15
smilingbig: so you got this boilerplate from aws?

01:44:21
<transcript>: New height I don't need anymore so I guess.

01:44:29
<transcript>: It's going to be something like this. It's going to be like the parent height times the ratio or something. Let's try that.

01:44:29
smilingbig: I really like all the sample projects they have for cdk and everything, pretty cool for getting started with stuff quick

01:44:32
<transcript>: Parent Height Times ratio.

01:44:33
mecoupz: @overra_dev zero because that macbook thing is a scam

01:44:39
<transcript>: But we're going to say that two Int. Like this. Two Int.

01:44:46
<transcript>: We're going to delete this. I don't know that we don't need to change this.

01:44:49
<transcript>: We're just going to do the same thing on both and then see what happens.

01:44:52
<transcript>: New width. Okay.

01:44:54
<transcript>: This is cool, music.

01:44:54
<transcript>: who's excited

01:44:57
<transcript>: Who's excited about this music? I'm kind of excited about it.

01:44:58
oleksii_lisovyi: Macbainted stream actually

01:45:02
<transcript>: Sorry that I'm bobbing my head probably slightly off the beat.

01:45:05
<transcript>: Just getting kind of excited about this music.

01:45:05
<transcript>: let's see what

01:45:05
overra_dev: @mecoupz adamdo8DealWithIt

01:45:06
oleksii_lisovyi: *macbaited

01:45:07
<transcript>: Let's see what this does.

01:45:11
<transcript>: Is it better? No, it's not any different.

01:45:15
<transcript>: Mac baited. A Mac baited. Stream.

01:45:16
smilingbig: but obviously sst > cdk

01:45:18
<transcript>: How many macbooks? Is that.

01:45:18
<transcript>: what

01:45:22
<transcript>: What do it for? 10 million Adam Bucks.

01:45:22
<transcript>: while

01:45:39
<transcript>: While I would recommend setting this up outside the stream, you can use pseudo ide ideals to use Android Studio headless. Interesting as a neo vim lsp source coding Rob coming in with my love language neo vim that sounds amazing.

01:45:39
<transcript>: that sounds

01:45:43
<transcript>: That sounds fantastic. I would like to do that.

01:45:43
<transcript>: i'm not going

01:45:50
<transcript>: I'm not going to do it right this second, but I would like to do that in Z. Laura, do you want to build this for us? For free? Yeah. Our budget is free.

01:45:50
<transcript>: we'll give you

01:45:52
<transcript>: We'll give you 10,000 Adam Bucks.

01:45:54
<transcript>: That's so funny.

01:45:58
<transcript>: Try cross because you forget.

01:46:02
<transcript>: I haven't touched kotlin for like six years.

01:46:02
<transcript>: and

01:46:06
<transcript>: And you still know all this stuff in Z, Laura, Wow.

01:46:11
<transcript>: I think we can make it work? Yeah, I can give you as many Adam Bucks as you want.

01:46:12
mecoupz: adam once again gets back to chat 5 minutes late :D

01:46:24
<transcript>: so you got this blur plate from aws i did i really like all the sample projects they have for cdk and everything pretty cool for getting started with stuff quick yeah this is very much our use case it's reading off the ivs stream metadata which is exactly what we need to do

01:46:29
<transcript>: It's just going to be getting familiar with the code base. That's the learning curve right now.

01:46:46
<transcript>: Adam, once again, five minutes late. I'm always five minutes late. I'm so sorry. I'll see if anyone YouTube is asking things on YouTube. Nope. Still no. Everybody still nobody cares on YouTube. But how about those vods? We're going to have some nice, high quality 4k vods. Let's try divide. What do you say.

01:46:50
<transcript>: This is one way to do it.

01:46:50
<transcript>: ratio

01:46:55
<transcript>: Ratio height divided by width, so that's the ratio of the video right.

01:46:58
<transcript>: Oh.

01:46:58
<transcript>: nailed it

01:47:04
<transcript>: Nailed it. First try. 2nd, 3rd try. What were we? 2nd, 3rd try. Something like that. All right, I'm hungry.

01:47:07
<transcript>: I'm hungry. So here we are.

01:47:07
<transcript>: we're going to

01:47:11

01:47:15
overra_dev: ratio*height

01:47:20
<transcript>: We're going to eat a larbon bar. Hey, that rhymed. I can't even open it today. Oh, after this, I'm going to do Twitter time. So if you want me to read a tweet on this very stream.

01:47:20
<transcript>: as if

01:47:23
mecoupz: TWITTER TIME

01:47:23
<transcript>: As if my takes on those tweets are worth watching.

01:47:26
oleksii_lisovyi: Not we, you Adam, don't be mean

01:47:30

01:47:34
<transcript>: Fixbug. Thank you so much for that. Follow. Fixed bug. I missed that. I'm sorry.

01:47:40
<transcript>: Ratio times height times the height.

01:47:40
<transcript>: times

01:47:54
nzlaura: my current work has an epic native android setup with jetpack, kotlin, etc. so i just stay up to date with what they do ^_^ i work in platform engineering day to day though

01:48:00
<transcript>: Times the height. Okay. Ratio times height. No, it was divided. Actually divided. Worked. I don't know why I'm not going to. I'm not going to ask questions, but it worked. I got recommended. Got you recommended on my YouTube and came to your twitch stream Supreme Master TV rozitio, thank you so much for that following or recommendation and.

01:48:00
<transcript>: ending up here

01:48:04
<transcript>: Ending up here. Wait. I guess you didn't say that. You're glad you're here.

01:48:04
<transcript>: so

gitpush_gitpaid: wait the stream ending?

01:48:21
<transcript>: Twitter time. Do you still remember a lot? Of course I remember lawn. Are you lawn? Did you rename your name to Supreme Master TV? Because I will map it to Lawn if I need to.

01:48:21
<transcript>: i've got

01:48:24
<transcript>: I've got a big brain where I can map things.

suprememastertv_rosidae0: the suprememastertv part is an inside joke you can just call me rosi or lon

01:48:43
oleksii_lisovyi: @adamdotdev that's about eating the bar

01:50:27
<transcript>: People pay some Twitter links. We're getting ready to have Twitter times can be a good time.

01:50:27
<transcript>: we're going to look

01:50:34
<transcript>: We're going to look at all your tweets. Please don't send stuff that I'm going to regret opening because it's going to open automatically.

01:50:44
<transcript>: Git push get paid. I thought you guys were avoiding me and ending the stream because I came in. I know you guys were talking about it before I came in, you know it. You know, we were get push.

01:50:44

01:50:50

<transcript>: Too far. Let's try it, Allen. Show some respect.

01:50:55
<transcript>: twelve engineers

01:50:57
<transcript>: Twelve engineers. Twelve search. I got twelve of them.

01:50:57

01:51:00
thdxr: one

01:51:00
<transcript>: Okay, I'm as certified as you can be.

01:51:02
thdxr: done

01:51:13
<transcript>: Okay, do we have all the Tweets, the Tweets, the twits into the chat? And we'll do Twitter time. Question is when you plan on becoming a prompt engineer, that's a great question.

01:51:16
vapor__dev: @thdxr wham bam thank u maam

01:51:19
<transcript>: Someone who gets things down, promptly, done.

01:51:22

01:51:22
ryankhawkins: @thdxr :D

01:51:27
<transcript>: All right. Are we ready to look at Twitter? Let's look at Twitter.

01:51:38
<transcript>: Yes, I love this. I love it.

01:51:38
<transcript>: i love that

01:51:45

01:52:04
<transcript>: So.

01:52:13
<transcript>: This I guess this falls into the category for me of like Developer trope jokes that I personally don't find funny.

01:52:16
<transcript>: I don't shame anyone for finding it funny.

01:52:26
<transcript>: But it's less funny to me than maybe the average developer. I don't know. It does surprise me that 3000 people thought this was funny.

01:52:46
<transcript>: What? Hey, code one, I want you to update my chat.

01:52:53
<transcript>: Chat by eli repo I want you to go find the file, that's the loader, and I want you to replace.

01:52:56
<transcript>: The Dot icon. And put this.

01:52:59

01:57:30
<transcript>: are those boxes just

01:57:33
<transcript>: Are those boxes? Just whatever his hand size.

01:57:33
<transcript>: and

01:57:39
<transcript>: And amount that he can grab at once is that doesn't seem right.

01:57:43
<transcript>: Do they have a follow up step where somebody goes through.

01:57:43
<transcript>: and

01:57:44
<transcript>: And.

01:57:49
mattmancodes: I need that in my life

01:57:57
<transcript>: Takes out some from evens them out. Like weighs them and moves nails around. Do they do that? Tell me that they count them. They don't just give anybody whatever he grabs, do they? Oh my goodness.

01:58:02
<transcript>: Can you push your latest overlay code so I can look for exploits? Absolutely not.

01:58:04
gitpush_gitpaid: well theres a scale there im assuming they weigh the boxes

01:58:05
thdxr: maybe they're just organizing nails for thier own use

01:58:06
vansalzig: They count them bi weight. I'm pretty sure :)

01:58:08
<transcript>: My overlay code may have been frozen in time on github. It may now just be a.

01:58:09
treasonist: prob go by weight?

01:58:11
smilingbig: err yeah sure they count them ...

01:58:11
wietlol: prolly first bulk filling, then weights and add/remove until weight is correct

01:58:34
<transcript>: Yeah, sure, they count them. They don't count them. I watched. Probably go by weight. Maybe by wait.

01:58:36
zgredfred1: I guess they init package with one grab, and then make small adjustments with scale

01:58:39
<transcript>: They're just organizing nails for their own use. That's a lot of nails they need. There.

01:58:47
<transcript>: Probably first bulk filling, then weights and add remove until weight is correct. That's my guess.

<transcript>: welcome

02:07:10
<transcript>: Welcome to my chat. I decided to come over here to tell you welcome. I really love seeing new people in chat. This is I'm coming on a little strong. It's a little intense. You just wanted to say something in chat about how this person's a music influencer. And then I'm doing this. I'm coming over here and I'm yelling at you.

02:07:12
<transcript>: I'm sorry.

02:07:12
<transcript>: i was just very

mattmancodes: @hasanhaja one of his best

02:07:21

02:07:21
<transcript>: you

02:07:21
mattprogramr: but hello

02:07:22
thdxr: SST is a YC company, maybe I should have done real estate instead

<transcript>: You met Rick rubin. Allen, you have the most interesting life. It's official. Everything in your life is interesting. You have that uncle story with the fighter jets. It's the coolest. Or grandpa? Was that your grandpa? And you met Rick rubin? I didn't know who Rick ruben was, like, five minutes ago, but that's still very cool.

02:07:42
<transcript>: Your brother would be disappointed.

02:07:42
<transcript>: oh because

02:07:45
<transcript>: Oh, because he's a musician.

02:07:48
<transcript>: And he would know who Rick rubin is. For sure.

02:07:49
overra_dev: it's all one story

02:07:49
hasanhaja: Couldn't resist!

02:07:49

02:08:46
vapor__dev: its basically everyone in my famil's life is interesting....im boring af

02:08:50

02:08:54
<transcript>: That's a good tweet. It is very true.

Six hundred and fifty s I realized you asked the question to the bots and the box let you down but I won't let you down never going to give you up, never going to let you down okay, let's get back to work. It's basically everyone in my family's life is interesting. I'm born.

02:09:12
<transcript>: well

02:09:16
<transcript>: Well, in comparison to everybody else, you would look boring. But you're not boring.

02:09:16
<transcript>: all right

02:09:21
<transcript>: All right, let's do this. We fixed it. We made the height. The right height.

02:09:21
<transcript>: feels good

02:09:22
<transcript>: Feels good.

02:09:25
thdxr: nah alan is boring

02:09:31

02:09:31
<transcript>: matt

02:09:33
<transcript>: Matt programmer.

02:09:35
vapor__dev: @thdxr FallCry

02:09:36
<transcript>: Matt. What's his name.

02:09:43
<transcript>: Matt programmer came into Chat, did not follow me, and I don't blame him after that intense.

02:09:43
<transcript>: thinking

02:09:51
<transcript>: Thinking. I just could not stop thanking him. I don't know why I've never done that. Listen, Chat can vouch for me. All these people mad programmer they coach with.

02:09:55
mattprogramr: u right, fixed it

02:09:58
mattmancodes: hahaha

02:10:01
<transcript>: Everyone here in Chat can vouch. I'm not usually that weird about somebody just entering chat, but it had been a bit today. Nobody had done it for a while. Fixed it. Thank you so much.

02:10:01
<transcript>: i just got

02:10:03
cowfacedev: You need to add your headphones..........

02:10:04
og_r3m00n: the bot let me down aswell, did i win? :D

02:10:04
andreaslorozco: not THAT weird

02:10:07
<transcript>: I just got very excited. Okay. I think one of these should be times. I think this is actually valid.

02:10:08
thdxr: adam begging for follows, cringe

02:10:09
vimcerf: YOU BETTER FOLLOW! Madge

02:10:10
<transcript>: And one of them should be times but I don't know which one.

02:10:10
<transcript>: let's

02:10:13
<transcript>: Let's try this. If we rotate it.

02:10:13
<transcript>: that doesn't

02:10:18
<transcript>: That doesn't help me. It doesn't actually do anything when you rotate. So who cares.

02:10:22
cowfacedev: he is getting better @thdxr LUL

02:10:27
<transcript>: I'm going to try making one of them divide. No, it doesn't matter. I think it just always needs to be this. Watch this, watch this.

02:10:30
<transcript>: Just like that. Now we can delete all this.

02:10:36
<transcript>: New width ratio. And then we can just define it just like this.

02:10:36
<transcript>: let's just

02:10:38
<transcript>: Let's just do like this.

02:10:45
<transcript>: Now we're getting somewhere that needs to be down here, though.

02:10:45
<transcript>: look at

02:10:50
<transcript>: Look at us. Look at us. Making progress.

02:10:59
<transcript>: Okay. Save that. So now what do we need to do now? We need to hit. Let's hit our actual stream, if you'll recall.

02:10:59
<transcript>: if you recall

02:11:02
<transcript>: If you recall, I am streaming right now.

02:11:13
<transcript>: Rick eisley Asley Rick Ashley. Rick isley. What is his name? I'm streaming him to ivs at this very moment from my machine and here we go.

02:11:16
<transcript>: And I'm begging for follows. Cringe, stop it.

02:11:24
<transcript>: You guys. Nobody's won have they? No, nobody's won yet. Today.

02:11:27
<transcript>: You guys will let me know if somebody wins, right.

02:11:27
<transcript>: i need to add

02:11:31
gitpush_gitpaid: won what

02:11:33
og_r3m00n: Adam sir i think ur bot is down

02:11:36
<transcript>: I need to add my headphones. I do. Hey cowface, you're a mod. Why don't you do that? Why don't you log into fossil bot and just add that command while you're in there? Could you also add.

02:11:37
fyvel8000: rickrolling the whole chat heh Kappa

02:11:39
<transcript>: A command. For what was it.

02:11:39
<transcript>: there was something else we

02:11:41
<transcript>: There was something else we needed to add a command for.

02:11:48
<transcript>: I'm blanking I feel like you should know you should know cowface don't let me down.

02:11:48
<transcript>: i hope

02:11:59
<transcript>: I hope my instructions were clear. Okay, so here's our air table. This is where we're going to be able to. No, this is not the one. This is not the one. Dax, is it. Is this the one? Let's try.

02:12:00
<transcript>: Send a question.

02:12:04
<transcript>: And.

02:12:04
<transcript>: it

02:12:08
thdxr: yeah it is

02:12:18
<transcript>: It worked. And it worked. Okay, it worked. So I can delete that it'll pop back in there. Here we are. We have questions. This is a sample question. Another question. We can send the questions. Dax will work on the styling here.

02:12:20
zxshan: Apologies if you've mentioned before, what was the engineering  decision behind building this natively instead of using something like React Native? @adamdotdev

02:12:21
<transcript>: It's a little scuffed. That's okay.

02:12:21
<transcript>: i

02:12:22
zxshan: I heard you not enjoying the DX of Java/Kotlin yesterday so interested why you'd go in this direction

02:12:23
<transcript>: I am a friend and engineer. I believe.

02:12:29
overra_dev: the edelkrone?

02:12:38
<transcript>: Apologies if you've mentioned before, what was the engineering decision behind building this natively instead of using something like React native Alex rq, thank you so much for that. Follow. Just want to say thank you before I answer this question and the answer to that question is.

02:12:43
<transcript>: Because I kept running into mask the issues. I couldn't mask.

02:12:43
<transcript>: and animate

02:12:49
<transcript>: And animate and that's like the main thing I need to be able to do is animate a mask. And I couldn't.

02:12:49
<transcript>: in android

02:12:59
<transcript>: In Android in React native. So I went native. I regret a bit of it because Expo was really nice. This is a nightmare. Like I'm going to be seeing kotlin stuff in my nightmares tonight.

02:13:03
zxshan: Thank you :D

02:13:06
thdxr: when are you going to take off your mask and reveal your true self

02:13:07
<transcript>: But here we are. Here we are. Here we are, dax. Maybe second guessing it based on the pace at which I am moving.

02:13:07
<transcript>: but

02:13:11
hasanhaja: Kotlin's dope though!

02:13:17
<transcript>: But I wasn't moving much faster in Expo. When are you going to take off your mask and reveal your true self? Vladich, thank you so much for the follow. Did I say mask? Oh, it's talking about. Yeah, math.

02:13:17
<transcript>: i heard you not

02:13:19
thdxr: tbh think you're moving faster now

02:13:23
<transcript>: I heard you not enjoying the dx of java kotlin yesterday. So interested. Why you'd go in this direction? Yeah, I don't know.

02:13:23
<transcript>: you're not

02:13:25
<transcript>: You're not moving faster. Now.

02:13:33
<transcript>: Collins dope. Everyone loves kotlin. Everyone says positive things about kotlin. And I'm sure they're right, but.

02:13:36
<transcript>: I'm not getting up to speed very quickly.

02:13:36
<transcript>: feel

02:13:40
zxshan: Kotlin is dope

02:13:43
mattmancodes: they're not

02:13:44
thdxr: the language is good esp compared to java

02:13:50
<transcript>: Feels like a lot. I haven't been doing like mvc or mvvm for like ten years, so learning all that again and like, why is this not all just in one file? Why do I have a model folder and a models file and a view models file.

02:13:50
<transcript>: and a component

02:13:51
therealzurx: What keyboard is that?

02:13:54
<transcript>: And a component file and a provider and a repository.

02:13:54
<transcript>: oh

02:13:56
mattmancodes: @thdxr that's the main thing

02:13:57
<transcript>: Oh, man hurts my brain.

02:13:57
<transcript>: the

02:14:02
adamdotdev: !keyboard

02:14:02
fossabot: Adam uses a custom Mode Eighty mechanical keyboard, and has a collection of other Mode keyboards!

02:14:02
kedemel: I prefer C#.

02:14:03
wietlol: kotlin is dope... android development is... "interesting"...

02:14:04
<transcript>: The real zura. It is a mode I do actually have. I do actually have a keyboard command, keyboard.

02:14:04
<transcript>: i do have one

02:14:15
<transcript>: I do have one here. Custom mode 80 mechanical keyboard I have a collection of other mode keyboards is true. Android development is interesting. Kotlin though is good. Oh how do you separate the two.

02:14:15
<transcript>: is kotlin used

02:14:19
<transcript>: Is kotlin used for things other than Android development.

02:14:19
<transcript>: is that

02:14:20
<transcript>: Is that a thing.

02:14:21
tini_turner: but mvc has nothing to do with kotlin LUL

02:14:21
vapor__dev: adam 99.99 % of the time: 0 accent adam 0.01% of the time saying "again": "ageeeeen"

02:14:25
nzlaura: yeah general backend

02:14:27
<transcript>: Okay. So now what we need to do is.

02:14:29
thdxr: agggeeeeeen

02:14:34
<transcript>: I want to hit the real url. So the way I'm going to do that is instead of this.

02:14:34
<transcript>: well

02:14:37
hasanhaja: I used to use Kotlin as a drop in replacement for Java

02:14:38
<transcript>: Well, first step. I guess I could just do.

02:14:40
<transcript>: Could I just do.

02:14:44
<transcript>: The I could just hard code it first.

02:14:50
<transcript>: That's progress kind of, but I need to hit the API. Should we just start working on the API.

02:14:53
stroopwafel26: all i hear is murican english

02:15:00
<transcript>: Could just start working on the api. Oh, I just got a little depressed thinking about the fact that I'm going to build this, and then I have to build it again.

02:15:01
thdxr: get the url from the network inspector

02:15:03
hasanhaja: Didn't really play around with Native, KotlinJS or Kotlin Multiplatform much

02:15:06
<transcript>: Like I built it. Now I'm going to have to build it in Swift. After this, at least I have some familiar.

02:15:06
<transcript>: familiarity

02:15:11
<transcript>: Familiarity with Swift. It's not totally foreign to me. I've built a Swift app before.

02:15:14
<transcript>: 99% of the time zero accent.

02:15:14
<transcript>: atom

02:15:18
<transcript>: Atom 0.1% of the time saying again.

02:15:24
wietlol: kotlin is just a language, you can use it for pretty much everything atm, usually used with JVM runtime, but can also build to windows/linux/mac native apps or just transpile to JS/wasm to run in the browser

02:15:32
<transcript>: My wife says I say the word roof. Funny. Like how a dog barks roof. No, I say roof. It's a roof instead of roof. She's got me saying it right now. I say it right. Bright neon.

02:15:32
<transcript>: thank you for

02:15:33
<transcript>: Thank you for that. Follow.

02:15:33
<transcript>: three thousand seven hundred

02:15:36
<transcript>: 3700, you are number 3700.

02:15:36
<transcript>: there's no

02:15:38
kedemel: I always said "ruff".

02:15:40
stroopwafel26: life's roof

02:15:48
<transcript>: There's no prizes for that. But thank you for being follower number 3700 on the dot. You always say rough, rough. It's a rough. We just had solar panels added to our roof.

02:15:54
<transcript>: Didn't really play around with nateive kotlin, js, or kotlin multiplatform much.

02:15:58
<transcript>: Get the URL from the network Inspector. No, we're going to just do the hard thing.

02:15:58
<transcript>: we're just going to actually

02:15:59
<transcript>: We're just going to actually.

02:16:02
<transcript>: Do the hard thing.

02:16:06
<transcript>: Mvc has nothing to do with Kotlin. Okay, so kotlin.

02:16:06
<transcript>: is sometimes

02:16:10
<transcript>: Is sometimes not MDC sounds nice.

02:16:10
<transcript>: sounds

02:16:12
<transcript>: Sounds nice.

02:16:16
<transcript>: Lice roof it's rough it's roof.

02:16:20
<transcript>: Here's my do. I'm going to go to usages.

02:16:20
<transcript>: this

02:16:24
<transcript>: This is the place where I need to actually go get a really URL.

02:16:34
<transcript>: Source data item has a url, a title and is default. I think we can simplify this git sources.

02:16:39
<transcript>: I think we could simplify this.

02:16:39
<transcript>: a nit play

02:16:43
<transcript>: A nit player, and then git sources URL that value.

02:16:48
<transcript>: Configuration link? What happens if I say portrait.

02:16:49
nzlaura: @Wietlol i have never heard of kotlin transpiling to js, that's super interesting

02:16:51
<transcript>: Live Portrait link.

02:16:54
<transcript>: And restart it.

02:17:02
<transcript>: Colin is just a language. You can use it for pretty much everything at the moment. Usually used with jvm runtime but can also.

02:17:08
<transcript>: Build to Windows, linux, Mac native apps or just transport to JS wasm to run the browser. Interesting.

02:17:08
<transcript>: isn't it just

02:17:10
<transcript>: Isn't it just java, though.

02:17:10
<transcript>: is it actually

02:17:25
<transcript>: Is it actually new stuff on top of java? I feel like it looks just like java. Bruno. Bruno. Bruno. Bruno. Thank you so much for that follow. I appreciate your follow. I had a little caffeine today. I think that's to blame. That's why I'm a little amped up.

02:17:25
<transcript>: it wasn't much

02:17:30
wietlol: @nzlaura its a bit rusty atm, but they are starting to give it more attention now that they are done with most of the compiler tools

02:17:35
<transcript>: It wasn't much caffeine compared to yesterday. Yesterday. I had probably like 150 milligrams today. 35 should be fine, but I'm definitely feeling a little amped up.

02:17:45
<transcript>: Still no macbook winner.

02:17:46
wietlol: its great, but doesnt have interop so it completely locks you out of JS

02:17:53
<transcript>: So this does nothing. I don't know what URL value is about, but it did nothing. Let's find usages.

02:17:55
wietlol: which is... bold

02:18:03
tnkhanh: why no vim today?

02:18:07
<transcript>: Okay. That's all. Whatever.

02:18:07
<transcript>: that's

02:18:09
<transcript>: That's fine.

02:18:12
<transcript>: We need to make a network request.

02:18:18
<transcript>: A Network request.

02:18:20
<transcript>: I want to undo this.

02:18:20
<transcript>: go

02:18:23
<transcript>: Go back to that.

02:18:27
<transcript>: A network request why no vim today? Because.

02:18:27
<transcript>: we're making

02:18:28
<transcript>: We're making.

02:18:28
<transcript>: an and

02:18:31
<transcript>: An Android app and I have to use Android studio.

02:18:37
<transcript>: I hate that I'm not near them right now.

02:18:37
<transcript>: this whole

02:18:37
hasanhaja: The last time I played with it years ago, it shipped a whole lot of the KotlinJS runtime, which was quite heavy

02:18:40
<transcript>: This whole experience is kind of painful.

02:18:40
<transcript>: it's okay

02:18:42
tnkhanh: LUL

02:18:44
<transcript>: It's okay, though. We're pushing through. Player, what am I doing.

02:18:44
<transcript>: i need to change

02:18:46
<transcript>: I need to change.

02:18:46
<transcript>: this

02:18:48
<transcript>: This go to definition.

02:18:48
<transcript>: go

02:18:50
<transcript>: Go to.

02:18:57
<transcript>: Declaration. Okay, this can no longer be a constant. In fact, let's just delete it.

02:18:57
hasanhaja: It was fun that everything was just Kotlin, but yeah!

02:19:03
qubiz: You can use the VIM plugin for Android Studio

02:19:04
<transcript>: Am I going to regret deleting this? Let's comment it out. How do you comment in Colin? Just like David.

02:19:04
<transcript>: yeah

02:19:06
<transcript>: Yeah.

02:19:15
<transcript>: Okay. So now we should have some compile time errors that we can jump to, and we can say that is not.

02:19:15
<transcript>: going to be

02:19:18
<transcript>: Going to be instantiated with anything.

02:19:20
wietlol: yea, you get a bigger deployment, but at least everything is strongly typed

02:19:21
<transcript>: And then where is another usage.

02:19:25
<transcript>: Main view Model error right here.

02:19:25
<transcript>: look at me becoming

02:19:25
lesabotsy: @adamdotdev are you doing this whole macbook thing forever or it's a one and done thing?

02:19:29
wietlol: even Typescript wont give you that

02:19:31
nzlaura: @Wietlol oh bugger! what is the use case for teams writing kotlin & transpiling to JS? for FP aspects?

02:19:32
<transcript>: Look at me becoming a kotlin dev. So here's where we're going to do a network request launch main.

02:19:32
<transcript>: how do i do

02:19:33
<transcript>: How do I do.

02:19:33
<transcript>: i do

02:19:36
<transcript>: I do a network request.

02:19:36
<transcript>: let's just

02:19:36
hasanhaja: You can " CMD + / " like in Vscode to toggle comments

02:19:46
<transcript>: Let's just ask Chad gbt, chat. Or I could ask Chat, twitch, twitch, Chat, gpt, twitch, chat. How do I make a network request.

02:19:46
<transcript>: i'm going to try

02:19:48
<transcript>: I'm going to try this.

02:19:52
<transcript>: Twitch. No.

02:19:56
<transcript>: How do I make a network request.

02:19:58
<transcript>: In kotlin.

02:20:03
nzlaura: retrofit?

02:20:05
zxshan: Do you have an opinion on larger dep/bundle/app sizes with teams making assumptions that everything will be loaded on the server anyway @thdxr?

02:20:08
spotmonk: you ask nicely. "please can I have a network?"

02:20:08
<transcript>: You can do command. I. Yes, actually. What I did, Hassan, before I even saw your message. I figured that out.

02:20:26
<transcript>: Lesa botsy, are you doing this whole macbook thing for Ever? Or it's a one and done thing. I'm going to do it forever. I mean, hopefully I don't give them away, like once a week. Hopefully it's like once a month, but yeah, no, I'm going to do it forever. I like randomness choosing who in the universe needs a laptop.

02:20:26
<transcript>: rand

02:20:32
<transcript>: Randomness means that the right people, I think, will end up with the laptops. That's what I choose to believe.

02:20:32
<transcript>: we'll

02:20:35
wietlol: @nzlaura yes, I wrote a few apps with KotlinJS, even one with React and MUI, but it is annoying when you need something that doesnt have proper typescript typedefinition files

02:20:36
zxshan: Referring to a post where I saw 'next' added like 40MB to a barebones react proj

02:20:52
<transcript>: We'll see if it is always true. I did a random macbook giveaway on Twitter and a person who needed it got it. And that makes me very happy. So I hope that the same thing will happen here on twitch. If somebody who doesn't need it gets it and they sell it on ebay, I'll be a little pissed, but I'll move on. It's your right to do whatever you want with it. Shiny one. Thank you so much for the follow.

02:20:52
zxshan: But because it's on the server it's all good ..?

02:20:54
<transcript>: I appreciate that follow.

02:20:57
<transcript>: Because it's on the server. It's all good.

02:21:01
pot0fgreeed: well, if it's actually random, then you'll should actually also have people who don't need it get it

02:21:02
kubahasek: @zxshan but it's not a client bundle, so I wouldn't worry too much

02:21:02
<transcript>: My elochron just beeped at me.

02:21:02
<transcript>: arose thank

02:21:02
smilingbig: I guess I won't be winning it then LUL

02:21:03
wietlol: I want it... and then refuse it :D

02:21:03
rudixworld: what if the winner is hardcore windows user :)

02:21:05
<transcript>: Arose. Thank you for the follow as well.

02:21:05
<transcript>: well

02:21:07
<transcript>: Well, it's actually random.

02:21:08
kubahasek: hello btw!

02:21:10
<transcript>: Then.

02:21:10
<transcript>: you should

02:21:12
fyvel8000: have you try the framework laptop? if yes how is it?

02:21:16
chinyone: greetz from germany

02:21:18
marcos_devone: good morning guys

02:21:18
<transcript>: You should actually have also have people who don't need get it, get it. That's a good point pot of greed. That's a good point.

02:21:18
<transcript>: i'm choosing

02:21:19
stroopwafel26: windows users are not welcome here /s

02:21:25
<transcript>: I'm choosing to believe that the randomness will always choose someone who needs it and tell proven otherwise.

02:21:25
<transcript>: please

02:21:27
lesabotsy: @adamdotdev damn, you have my utmost respect sir :)

02:21:27
<transcript>: Please, can I have a network.

02:21:29
smilingbig: first thing I'd do if I won a macbook is sell it and buy a linux laptop

02:21:30
smilingbig: KEKW

02:21:38
<transcript>: Do you have an opinion on larger depth bundle app sizes with teams making assumptions that everything will be loaded on the server anyway. Oh, DAX.

02:21:49
<transcript>: You asked like a question to a smart person, and I'm like, ooh, good question. I don't have a good answer, but great. And then you're directing it to dax because you know, he'll have a good answer.

02:21:49
<transcript>: it's okay

02:21:54
<transcript>: It's okay. It's okay. I don't feel offended at all. I've never been offended in my life.

02:22:08
zxshan: I didn't wanna interrupt you with another large question! @adamdotdev

02:22:09
<transcript>: You asked nicely. Okay. Yes. I wrote a few apps with kotlin. Okay, you guys are talking furniture. A post where I saw Next added like 40 megabytes to a bare Bones React Project oof, 40 megabytes the real zerks. Thank you so much for that. Follow. I keep getting follows. What happened.

02:22:09
<transcript>: is

02:22:11
<transcript>: Is there something I said.

dare_devel_ops: Pay it forward if you don't need it.... Karma points.

02:22:12
zxshan: Chat is vibin

02:22:16
<transcript>: Why'd you guys follow me for I mean, I like it. Hopefully you'll come back.

02:22:16
<transcript>: hopefully that

02:22:20
<transcript>: Hopefully that's what you followed me for. If it's actually random. Okay, I already read that.

02:22:24
thdxr: @zxshan they will severely impact cold starts

02:22:24
hasanhaja: @Wietlol I also had the same pain point when playing with ReasonML & ReScript. I loved the language and how quick the tooling was, but yeah. I wasn't smart enough to write those TS bindings effectively

02:22:28
<transcript>: Pay it forward if you don't need it. Karma Points thank you for the chat message. Welcome, daredevil dops welcome to chat.

02:22:28
<transcript>: adel

02:22:29
thdxr: so it does matter if in a serverless env

02:22:34
<transcript>: thank you

02:22:44
thdxr: if I win the macbook I'm going to make a video of my destroying it

02:22:45
<transcript>: Okay. I got to read some chat, so I'm just coming over here first thing I do if I want a macbook is sell it and buy a linux laptop.

02:22:46
<transcript>: It's funny.

02:22:46
<transcript>: less of

02:22:57
rollingx: all the follows are bot that think they deserve macbooks to be able to deploy more bots prolly

02:22:58
<transcript>: Less of a boy. You have my utmost respect, sir. What did I say? Did I say something? Addy code, sing songs for the follow. I have your respect. But I don't remember what we were talking about. Because I have a terrible memory.

02:22:59
kubahasek: good afternoon! (europe here haha)

02:23:02
tymekdev: Hey üëã How it's going?

02:23:06
<transcript>: Less a boy, less a boy. Let me see what you said. Are you doing this whole Mag leafing forever? Oh, the MacBook thing. Well, there you go.

02:23:10
<transcript>: I'm not just like doing it for pure reasons.

02:23:15
<transcript>: I enjoy the thought of someone getting something that they need. I have a lot more than I need.

02:23:15
<transcript>: that part

02:23:19
<transcript>: That part is true. I enjoy it, but also.

02:23:29
<transcript>: Having something like a MacBook giveaway gives you reason to hang out with me, so I'm kind of like buying your friendship. Why are you beeping edelcrone? Why.

02:23:36
<transcript>: Why are you beeping at me? It's beeping at me. So I need to pull up the app and see why.

02:23:39
vapor__dev: you printing something lol

02:23:39
<transcript>: You beeping at me.

02:23:39
<transcript>: it's my

02:23:42
<transcript>: It's my jib that moves the camera around.

02:23:42
<transcript>: stop

02:23:44
<transcript>: Stop. Go back.

02:23:49
<transcript>: I don't know why it it did that.

02:23:54
<transcript>: I'm surprised. Actually, it's never had an issue since we've been doing this.

02:23:54
<transcript>: okay

02:23:55
<transcript>: Okay.

02:23:58
<transcript>: That's a problem.

02:23:59
wietlol: @hasanhaja there is a tool to fetch the typedefs from a npm package, generate kotlin interfaces for it, but that only works for TS. when its not TS, then you have to publish your own npm package with typedefs, because they forgot that not everything is in npm

02:24:03
<transcript>: Don't mind me just controlling my mechanical cameras.

02:24:08
<transcript>: Okay even typescript won't give you that.

02:24:08
<transcript>: at least

02:24:14
<transcript>: At least everything strongly Typed. What is the use case for teams riding kotlin and transforming to JS.

02:24:20
<transcript>: Because it's on the server. It's all good.

02:24:31
<transcript>: Welcome to Jack Cuba. It's not a client bundle, so I wouldn't worry too much. You guys are having a conversation, and I don't remember what it's about, but it sounds like bundle sizes and such.

02:24:34
coolpantstv: When are you re-writing this in laravel @thdxr

02:24:43
<transcript>: I guess I won't be winning then. Oh, smiling. You don't need a laptop. Well, we'll see if the universe is aligned with me. I keep saying, the universe we'll see.

02:24:43
<transcript>: if

02:24:44
<transcript>: If.

02:24:51
<transcript>: It works out. We'll see if it continues. If Math Random continues to choose the right people or not.

02:24:55
thdxr: tbh pretty tempted after yesterday

02:24:56
<transcript>: I want it. Then refuse it. You're going to refuse it if you win.

02:25:00
thdxr: spent more time in the laravel docs

02:25:00
<transcript>: That'd be funny. If somebody finally wins, they're like, I don't want it.

02:25:07
<transcript>: That'd be awesome. What if a winner is a hardcore Windows user? You can put Windows on a Mac. You can do that right.

02:25:12
<transcript>: Hello, by the way. Hello, kubo. Welcome, welcome to chat.

02:25:12
<transcript>: i do appreci

02:25:13
pot0fgreeed: yeah you can

02:25:18
<transcript>: I do appreciate when people come in to chat and are immediately helpful, like they're helping other people in chat. That's awesome.

02:25:18
coolpantstv: I started a laravel project yesterday for fun and it is pretty nice tbh lol

02:25:19
hasanhaja: @Wietlol Ah cool cool! Definitely think the KotlinJS space a little more love and care to make it better

02:25:20
pot0fgreeed: though not sure the windows experience is that good

02:25:31
<transcript>: Have you tried the Framework laptop? If yes. How is it? I've never tried it. Chinny One greets from Germany. Welcome to my Chat Jenny. Thank you for the follow. Thanks for joining us in chat.

02:25:46
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: I don't think people understand how much a 1on1 call is worth with you...since it's guaranteed. Save your points ppl!

02:25:51
<transcript>: First thing I do if I want a macbook, sell it and buy linux. Oh, yeah, I read that. I don't want to interrupt you with another large question. Go for it, zia. Shannon, you can no hit me with the oh, you meant that's why you asked dax. Interrupt dax all you want. He doesn't care. He loves it.

02:25:55
mattprogramr: hardcore windows user = hardcode vsc user, same energy, this chat needs some prime vibes

02:26:00
<transcript>: Welcome to chat.

02:26:00
<transcript>: devil ops

02:26:11
<transcript>: Devil ops. What does it remind me of? Deviled Eggs? No. Daredevil ops. Devops. Devops develops something about it. I want to say something else when I read your name.

02:26:23
dare_devel_ops: Dare Devil and DevOps

02:26:23
kubahasek: might as well save my point for the 1on1 call LUL

02:26:27
<transcript>: Let's see I'm catching up. Catching up. Catching up chat is vibing. They will severely impact cold starts. Also had the same pain point when playing with reason. Ml okay, you guys are talking about big brain stuff so it does matter if it's in a serverless. If I win the macbook, I'm going to make a video of me destroying it.

02:26:33
<transcript>: That'd be so mean. Dex. People might want that laptop. You can't destroy it.

02:26:33
<transcript>: all

02:26:34
therealzurx: @the_real_enrico_pallazzo what would you guys talk about?

02:26:39
<transcript>: All the follows are bots that think they deserve MacBooks to be able to deploy more bots probably.

02:26:44
lesabotsy: @adamdotdev But the thing of giving when you can is a really good thing. And no I'm here cause I feel less alone in front of a computer listening to your ramblings, and the amazing prod. Never been lucky no way I win :p

02:26:47
<transcript>: Good afternoon, kuba. In Europe. Lots of people in Europe, in the stream. You guys can all talk about stroop. Waffles and whatever.

02:26:47
<transcript>: you got

02:26:49
erose524: I'm not a bot :)

02:26:56
<transcript>: You got friends in Europe. Here among US. Timec is here. How's it going? Timec you printing something? Am I printing something.

02:26:56
<transcript>: did i make

02:27:01
hasanhaja: If @thdxr wins, we'll know this whole thing is rigged!

02:27:05
stroopwafel26: not everyone in europe eats stroopwafels adam omg

02:27:06
mattmancodes: the bepps

02:27:07
dare_devel_ops: some turn it in to Dare develops

02:27:08
metajezza: 3pm here uk. Watching while working

02:27:09
<transcript>: Did I make a printing noise? What happened? There's a tool to fetch the type desk from an mpm package. Generate kotlin interfaces for it, but that only works for ts when it's not ts, you have to publish your own immune package with type desk because I forgot that not everything is.

02:27:09
<transcript>: mpm

02:27:09
mattmancodes: beeps

02:27:10
<transcript>: Mpm.

02:27:10
<transcript>: oh

02:27:13
<transcript>: Oh, you were talking to somebody else. I wondered why I didn't understand the.

02:27:22
hasanhaja: @metajezza Ah yes, I should be working too

02:27:25
tropichana: Am I the only Canadian

02:27:27
<transcript>: To be honest. Pretty tempted. After yesterday? Yeah. Dax, please tell me. Tell me more about the conversation with erin. I've asked you like seven times. Could you just please answer me? How did it go with Aaron? Are you going to write php forever? Now.

02:27:27
<transcript>: i started

02:27:33
<transcript>: I started a larvae project yesterday for fun. It's pretty nice. I hear it's pretty nice.

02:27:37
thdxr: me and Aaron got into a big fight

02:27:40
thdxr: on stream

02:27:40
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: @adamdotdev How would you go about making an iOS app that only uses the camera and sends a pic to a DataBase...and awaits for a response?

02:27:42
thdxr: was kinda awkward

02:27:42
<transcript>: Cool. Definitely think the kotlin JSpace okay, I got to stop reading sub by Colin because I don't know what it is.

02:27:47
kodder: tropicHana no

02:27:53
coolpantstv: It's true it was a fist fight

02:27:59
<transcript>: I don't think people understand how much a one on one call is worth with you since it's guaranteed. Save your points, people. It's very kind of you real in rico. I don't know how much it's worth either, but I will look forward to that first time that somebody redeems 50,000 points to get on a one on one call. It'll be so much fun. We'll talk.

02:27:59
<transcript>: for

02:28:02
<transcript>: For ages about whatever you want can't wait.

02:28:02
<transcript>: hard

02:28:05
tropichana: Hi kodder

02:28:15
kodder: hello tropicHana

02:28:21
<transcript>: Hardcore Windows user equals hardcore vs. Code user same energy. This chat needs some prime vibes. Prime vibes. I'm not very prime like so it makes sense that there's not a lot of prime vibes around here. I do love prime, though wonderful human, Daredevil and DevOps that makes sense. Daredevil, DevOps kind of combined the two.

02:28:23
mattmancodes: Aaron was using Realplayer to stream for the chat

02:28:27
thdxr: talked to o'reilly they want me to make a course lol

02:28:29
kubahasek: I was playing around with Next 13 app dir and it's actually a great experience

02:28:41
<transcript>: What would you guys talk about? What would we talk about? The real enrico? The thing of giving when you can is a really good thing. And I'm not here. And no, I'm here because I feel less alone in front of a computer, listening to your ramblings and the amazing production never been lucky. No way, I win. You might win, lesa. You might you never know a rose is not a bot. Who said a rose is a bot.

02:28:44
stroopwafel26: @thdxr o rly

02:28:48
<transcript>: If dax wins, will know the holding is rigged. Yeah, we can't let that happen. That would be suspicious.

02:28:50
<transcript>: A Rose? Welcome to chat.

02:28:50

tymekdev: @stroopwafel26 That's a first time i am hearing about these

02:29:41
<transcript>: I'm the only Canadian. Are you really tropic. Tropic. Tropic. You and Aaron got into a big fight on Stream. No, you didn't. You did not. How did you go about making an iOS app that only uses the camera and sends a pick to a database and awaits for a response? So iOS app only uses the camera, sends a pick to a database, and.

02:29:41
<transcript>: awaits a resp

02:30:01
tymekdev: Oooh, I know these actually. I didn't know these are called like that!

02:30:01
<transcript>: Awaits a response. So real. Enrico, I actually want to make something like that for my wife to take pictures of recipes, to make a database out of it. And I'm going to use like Chad gbt. So I'm probably going to use Amazon Textract to get all the blob of text. Okay. You're not asking how to do that. You're not asking how to do ocr, just take a.

02:30:01
<transcript>: picture

02:30:02
stroopwafel26: @stroopwafel26 go buy some

02:30:04
<transcript>: Picture, send it to a database.

02:30:04
<transcript>: i would do it

02:30:06
<transcript>: I would do it in Swift. I don't know.

02:30:06
<transcript>: is that a good

02:30:10
<transcript>: Is that a good answer? Is that what you want to talk about on our one on one call.

02:30:11
zxshan: @the_real_enrico_pallazzo This is from a take home assignment ain't it

02:30:35
<transcript>: that's not

02:30:44
<transcript>: That's not what I said. I was like, that's so kind. I'll think about it. I'm not going to do it, though. I was playing around with Next 13 app directory and it's actually a great experience.

02:30:44
<transcript>: is it i

02:30:46
thdxr: I will do it if o'reilly buys me more cameras

02:30:48
stroopwafel26: linkedin still exists?

02:30:55
<transcript>: Is it? I've not played around with it. Zxan. How was coffee yesterday? It was so good. Jordan and Matt and I from here on twitch Chat. We hung out. We drank coffee.

02:31:00
<transcript>: Maliro had his baby with him. Good times, really good time.

02:31:00
<transcript>: his baby

02:31:13
<transcript>: His baby is adorable, and I've never seen a baby set for an hour and never get upset and just giggle at you the whole time. It was amazing. I kind of hated him for it because my babies were not that easy. I didn't hate him, though. It was great. It was so much fun.

02:31:13

02:31:38
<transcript>: i would probably

02:31:51
<transcript>: I would probably just start building and, you know, you've got a very set of a clear set of guidelines. What you need to accomplish, what I like to do when I build an app like that, where there's a lot of pieces. It's not like to build the simplest.

02:32:08

the_real_enrico_pallazzo: @adamdotdev  aha, ok that makes sense. The KISS principle...i forget it most times

02:32:43
<transcript>: Of that many to go. I thought you were saying you had that many. I was like, you're so close. Cuba. You'll be my first one on one.

02:32:54
<transcript>: Chose iOS versus Android since I have an old iphone myself. Yeah, I think iOS Swift development is much easier than kotlin. I mean, I have more experience, so maybe that's why. But this column experience does not seem easy.

02:32:54
<transcript>: do you

02:32:58

02:33:04
mattmancodes: @Cj_crew You can use it on the server but there will probably be better options given Swift is made for Apple products

02:35:37

02:35:42

02:56:26
<transcript>: Okay, timeic that description feels underwhelming. What are the switches? What is the plate? What are the keycats? Oh, you're so right, timec. People who actually care about keyboards do not get enough information from that command.

02:56:26
<transcript>: who wants to go

02:56:27
kylliangamer: I don't think anyone was actually doubting you adam, but cool though haha

<transcript>: What did I miss? Here? How many macbooks you giving away? Welcome to Chat, Alex. We'll give away as many as people win, which hopefully is not every day or every week. That would be painful. Is the macbook bot code open source. I need to scan my stream.

02:56:53
mecoupz: 'never

02:57:02
<transcript>: It would be open source if I pushed my latest code. My overlays are open source. I have not pushed my latest code. I just need to. I'm just lazy, but yeah, it's open source.

02:57:16

I mean, just last name, right? You don't see the real. Okay, I got to get off the screen. Get out of here. Get out of here. Email that was close. Did you really see a full name? Nobody saw a full name, right? Stable diffusion avatar. Oh, my.

02:57:22
<transcript>: goodness

02:57:27
alixd91: not full name

02:57:27
goodgrandpaa: We only saw Francesco

02:57:28
<transcript>: Goodness you guys. You think I'm going to go to all that trouble? I don't think anyone was actually doubting about them, but cool though.

02:57:54
<transcript>: Some of you. I don't know. I can't tell if you're trolling me or if you really don't believe me. And I don't want this to be like a rumor that this isn't a real thing. It's a real thing. There's a real macbook on the line, people. You just got to redeem two times a day forever until someone wins. One keyboard is not available anymore. Yeah, the Mode 80. You can't buy a Mode 80 anymore. It's true. Maybe someday. Kill.

kubahasek: i use the keychron k2 and it's sick but I might want to get something a bit better soon

02:58:21
<transcript>: Maybe somebody I'll give away one of my mode 80s ooh. That would be a giveaway right there. I'm fasting so if I could live vicariously through you while you eat your larvae that'd be great. Great point, Zxam. I need another larbar. I'll be our best.

02:58:24

02:59:19
<transcript>: You can buy a mode. Sonnet.

02:59:31
<transcript>: Okay.

02:59:34
<transcript>: I got to keep scrolling.

02:59:41
<transcript>: I don't have them gathering dust, but I do have a couple of 65s. You want to see them? I showed them yesterday on stream.

02:59:51
<transcript>: I believe if I were using a tomato timer, this would be a part of the stream where I'm not focused.

02:59:54
mecoupz: its on yt vod

02:59:55
<transcript>: I believe that's where we're at right now.

03:00:00
<transcript>: So my first mode 65.

03:00:04
<transcript>: Is this right here.

03:00:10
<transcript>: It's a Black Mode 65 with a white accent. Obviously.

03:00:13
<transcript>: I believe it's just a black bottom? Yeah.

03:00:14

03:00:51
<transcript>: All right, here's my cooler looking mode 65. This one is a white Mode 65. We got gold accents, so I got the gold plate, little gold artisan keycap, and gmk botanical keycaps.

03:00:59

mecoupz: @mattmancodes adamdo8DealWithIt

03:01:33
<transcript>: I guess I will. Okay. Define the endpoints. Let's see. Chat gbt told me what to do here. Create an api interface.

03:01:33
<transcript>: an ap

03:01:34
m2devdotnet: You mentioned last week one of your VODs had an office tour, but I couldn't find it - can you link it?

03:01:35
<transcript>: An api interface.

03:01:35
<transcript>: ooh

03:02:16
<transcript>: Oh, indy. Laura trying to give me tips, and then I missed it. I've got to head out. It's 01:30 a.m. There's.

03:02:16
<transcript>: a network adapter

03:02:24

nzlaura: might be overkill for what you're trying to do but yeh check it out anyway

03:02:50
nzlaura: later!

03:02:57
<transcript>: Said something else. I'm about to order Mode envoy Successor 65 for myself. Yes timec. Yes Mode keyboards are the best. I'm not sponsored by Mode, although I'd love to be sponsored by Mode. If Mode would sponsor me and just send me all their products for free. And if lara Barr would sponsor me and give me a lifetime supply of lar bars.

03:03:01
<transcript>: I will be all set.

03:03:09
<transcript>: That's really the only two things I care about my Mode keyboards and my lar bars.

03:03:13
<transcript>: Okay. See you NZ.

03:03:16
<transcript>: See a Hassan.

03:03:18

03:04:29
adamdotdev: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1759089989

03:04:32

03:04:32
m2devdotnet: Thanks!

03:04:37
<transcript>: Maybe like that report vod. Yeah.

03:04:47
<transcript>: Have you tweeted larbar asking? Pretty much everyone who watches ends up wanting to eat a larbor. I really should. I should try and reach out to lara herself. I don't know how, but I should try.

03:04:53
<transcript>: Almost. They're the chosen one. What are you almost there for? Oh.

03:04:53
<transcript>: the

03:04:56
<transcript>: The typing. I got you.

03:04:56
<transcript>: that's

03:04:57
<transcript>: That's funny.

03:04:57
<transcript>: a little awkward

03:05:03
<transcript>: A little awkward because my mom's here. But that was funny. She's not here. I don't know. She might be here.

03:05:09
<transcript>: Okay, kotlin api service. Here we go. Create an api interface.

03:05:13
<transcript>: Where would I put such an interface.

03:05:13
thechosenone1080: hi mom

03:05:15
<transcript>: Injection.

03:05:15
<transcript>: data common

03:05:16
<transcript>: Data common.

03:05:16
<transcript>: activ

03:05:18
<transcript>: Activities.

03:05:22
<transcript>: Adapters dialogues oh, My goodness.

03:05:22
<transcript>: data

03:05:22
kubahasek: what computer are you running on @adamdotdev

03:05:24
<transcript>: Data entity.

03:05:30
<transcript>: What computer are you running? It's a Max studio.

03:05:36
<transcript>: So if I wanted to put one of these interface things.

03:05:41
<transcript>: An api interface. Where would I put it.

03:05:48
<transcript>: Where would I put it? Where would I put it? Services. Is there like a services? No.

03:05:52
<transcript>: Injection Models View models.

03:05:55
kodder: it will be hard to reach lara any time soon. she is currently in peru solving an ancient wall puzzle in some recently discovered ruins.

03:05:57
<transcript>: Try to just put it in my view model? Let's just put it in my view model let's not get too carried away here.

03:05:59
<transcript>: In like file splitting.

03:05:59
<transcript>: i do see

03:06:02
<transcript>: I do see that they put a lot of the files.

03:06:02
<transcript>: in separate or

03:06:13
mattmancodes: LUL

03:06:14
<transcript>: In separate or a lot of the stuff in separate files here in kotlin, at least in this app. Let's just put it down here. Import retrofit to call http. Get. We're going to have a.

03:06:14
<transcript>: git

03:06:17
<transcript>: Git, git, stream.

03:06:24
<transcript>: Git, stream.

03:06:27
<transcript>: Call list. Not a list.

03:06:29
<transcript>: It's just stream.

03:06:32
<transcript>: Yes.

03:06:34
<transcript>: One.

03:06:34
<transcript>: our

03:06:37
<transcript>: Our model is already imported up here somewhere.

03:06:45
<transcript>: Models, models, models, models? Yes. Stream. Right there. Okay.

03:06:46
<transcript>: So.

03:06:46
<transcript>: get stream

03:06:47
kubahasek: right I see, upgraded to a M2 Pro MBP and it's just so sick compared to my 2018 MPB with and i7 hahah

03:06:54
<transcript>: Get stream. What's wrong with this? Why is it squiggling at me? Imports are only allowed to be in the file. Oh, okay, they enforce that.

03:06:57
<transcript>: Fine with me.

03:06:57
<transcript>: perfectly fine

03:06:59
<transcript>: Perfectly fine with me.

03:07:04
<transcript>: Let's actually move this to the top of the file, so it's not quite so lost.

03:07:09
<transcript>: Sorry for the loud cough. Okay, so we have api service.

03:07:15
<transcript>: Git stream. And then we're going to implement it. So that's the interface. Now let's implement it.

03:07:19
<transcript>: Sometimes you got to implement your interfaces.

03:07:22
<transcript>: Kotlin retrofit builder.

03:07:22
<transcript>: api

03:07:28
<transcript>: Api service retrofit create okay create a service layer.

03:07:31
<transcript>: What in the world? Okay.

03:07:36
<transcript>: Use the service layer in your application.

03:07:39
<transcript>: Okay.

03:07:41
<transcript>: Retrofit client.

03:07:41
<transcript>: do i just

03:07:45
<transcript>: Do I just ignore all of this? Is this all just to be ignored.

03:07:48
<transcript>: I feel like I missed something.

03:07:54
<transcript>: Like retrofit client. I feel like that was the start of something that I missed. The end of.

03:07:54
<transcript>: but can

03:07:58
<transcript>: But can I just do this? Base URL maybe I can just do this.

03:08:07
<transcript>: Api service is retrofit. Create.

03:08:07
<transcript>: i'm going to

03:08:09
<transcript>: I'm going to go with this approach.

03:08:11
<transcript>: I think this is okay.

03:08:20
<transcript>: We think this is okay. Right? I think so. I'm going to go with Yes.

03:08:24
<transcript>: Private val retrofit retrofit builder.

03:08:28
<transcript>: Show me import.

03:08:28
<transcript>: cool

03:08:29
<transcript>: Cool.

03:08:32
<transcript>: The base URL.

03:08:35
<transcript>: I'm just going to hard code that for now I guess.

03:08:35
<transcript>: although i got

03:08:40
<transcript>: Although I got to figure out how I'm going to pass environment variables into this thing, how am I going to do that.

03:08:41
kubahasek: chat died

03:08:43
<transcript>: I don't know.

03:08:43
<transcript>: i don

03:08:45
<transcript>: I don't know how we're going to do that.

03:08:45
<transcript>: i don't want

03:08:50
<transcript>: I don't want to learn environment variables right now, so I'm just going to hard code. It.

03:08:53
<transcript>: How is it? Hard coded? Let's see.

03:08:59
<transcript>: What is the url to a trpc thing? Hey, DAX.

03:09:01

03:09:39
thdxr: check the network inspector of the producer app

03:09:45
<transcript>: Not clear to me. Check the network Inspector of the producer app. Oh, that makes sense.

03:09:48
<transcript>: That makes perfect sense.

03:09:52
<transcript>: There's the producer app called the Get Stream Thing too.

03:10:02
<transcript>: Does it call get stream.

03:10:02
<transcript>: what is it

03:10:05
<transcript>: What is it doing? What are all of those things.

03:10:05
thdxr: yeah it does

03:10:16
<transcript>: Okay. We're not going to preserve log. We're going to refresh what is happening? What are all these messages? Oh my goodness. So chatty. It's so chatty. Must be ivs stuff.

03:10:16
<transcript>: real time

03:10:19
<transcript>: Real time. Endpoint question, live stream. Is this it.

03:10:25

03:27:10
<transcript>: Get sources is the last thing that fails.

03:27:11
mono_nz: the base url is bad

03:27:13
<transcript>: At the top of the stack.

03:27:13
<transcript>: base url

03:27:19
<transcript>: Base URL messing in slash. Oh, my goodness. There's an error right there. The bass URL is bad. Listen, people.

03:27:22
mono_nz: remove stream_create

03:27:25
<transcript>: You guys are the best. You're the best must end the next slide. Okay, so this needs to be.

03:27:25
<transcript>: like

03:27:28
<transcript>: Like that is the base url. But then how do I create.

03:27:28
<transcript>: the

03:27:41
<transcript>: The individual URL that I want to hit. You know what I'm saying? So if this right here api service GetStream Where's retrofit involved. Where does retrofit get involved in this whole thing right here. Create.

03:27:41
<transcript>: ap

03:27:45
<transcript>: Api Service Class Java.

03:27:52
<transcript>: Oh, this should be oh, this should be like this? Is that what it is? Get stream, create. Is that how it works.

03:27:54
sudzusama: open ApiService and set endpoints there

03:27:55
mono_nz: ApiService is where you define the endpoint

03:27:58
<transcript>: Is that how it works? That's kind of cool. If so, is that how it works? Anybody.

03:27:58
<transcript>: api

03:28:01
tini_turner: cant see LUL

03:28:03
<transcript>: Api service is where you define the endpoint. Did we do it API service.

03:28:03
<transcript>: ap

03:28:09
<transcript>: Api service. Right here. That's where I should define the endpoint. Yeah. Right here.

03:28:11
<transcript>: Can't see there. Is it right here.

03:28:17
<transcript>: Why can't you see? Was it on a different camera? I'm sorry. Sometimes that does get in the way.

03:28:17
<transcript>: look

03:28:20
<transcript>: Look at this. Is that going to work? Let's just try it.

03:28:20
<transcript>: rerun

03:28:21
<transcript>: Rerun.

03:28:21
<transcript>: re

03:28:24
<transcript>: Rerun that quiz demo.

03:28:28
<transcript>: Rerun it.

03:28:28
<transcript>: launch

03:28:29
<transcript>: Launch succeeded.

03:28:29
<transcript>: log

03:28:32
<transcript>: Logcat, says, what.

03:28:32
<transcript>: log

03:28:34
<transcript>: Logcat says.

03:28:39
<transcript>: Null pointer exception Uri string.

03:28:39
<transcript>: oh

03:28:41
<transcript>: Oh, what's the problem.

03:28:44
<transcript>: Could not remove.

03:28:44
<transcript>: durh

03:28:49
<transcript>: Durh let's rerun it. I feel like we're in a weird state there. Maybe for a second.

03:28:49
<transcript>: okay

03:28:57
<transcript>: Okay. Close app. So what is it saying? It's saying, now null pointer exception at Uri.

03:28:57
<transcript>: so

03:29:00
<transcript>: So player start right here.

03:29:04
<transcript>: The Uri value. Oh, because I'm not initializing that value anymore.

03:29:07
<transcript>: So what do we do.

03:29:09
<transcript>: We need to.

03:29:13
parkour_peter: Hello again!

03:29:16
<transcript>: The uri. I've got to default it to something, don't I.

03:29:24
kubahasek: 49000 points left!

03:29:25
<transcript>: I've got to default it to something. Hello, parkour. How's parkour? Peter doing.

03:29:28
<transcript>: Open api service and set endpoints there.

03:29:34
<transcript>: 49,000 points left. You're on your way Cuba you're well on your way.

03:29:34
<transcript>: so

03:29:37
<transcript>: So I guess the question is.

03:29:44
<transcript>: How can I default? It meaningfully. Like right here is where it was defaulted.

03:29:44
<transcript>: how can i

03:29:44
sudzusama: also click soft wrap on logcat panel

03:29:47
<transcript>: How can I? Oh, jeez, how can I default it in a way that.

03:29:50
<transcript>: Makes sense.

03:29:52
woffyqt: @sudzusama hi master

03:30:06
<transcript>: I really don't want to. I don't want to start the player until we have a url. You know what I'm saying? Can I do the http request right here? Can I just do it up there or can I not do that in a knit? Is it like an asynchronous thing you can't do? Let's just try.

03:30:06
<transcript>: it can't

03:30:08
<transcript>: It can't hurt to try.

03:30:12
<transcript>: That's what I always say can't hurt to try.

03:30:12
<transcript>: a knit

03:30:13
<transcript>: A knit.

03:30:19
<transcript>: Url value.

03:30:23
<transcript>: Going to be up here.

03:30:30
<transcript>: Stream. Url. Am I doing this twice? Yes. Do I care? No.

03:30:30
<transcript>: because

03:30:31
<transcript>: Because.

03:30:31
<transcript>: i'm just trying

03:30:38
<transcript>: I'm just trying. We can clean it up in a minute, but I'm just trying can't hurt me for trying.

03:30:38
<transcript>: it

03:30:40
<transcript>: It can't hurt to try.

03:30:40
<transcript>: where

03:30:49
<transcript>: Where is Stream service? Right here. Okay, we're trying this. I don't know how asynchronous stuff works in Colin. I have no idea.

03:30:53
<transcript>: But should I have dependency injected this? Maybe.

03:31:07
<transcript>: Hello, woofie Q two. Welcome to Chat. Woofy qt Q two. Qt Q two. Also, click Soft Wrap on logcat panel. Oh, that sounds nice. Soft wrap, soft.

03:31:07
<transcript>: wrap

03:31:13
<transcript>: Wrap. I don't want hard wrap. I want soft wrap. Where are you.

03:31:13
<transcript>: i don't see soft

03:31:15
<transcript>: I don't see soft wrap.

03:31:17
sudzusama: left bottom corner

03:31:21
<transcript>: Soft wrap. There we go. So what happened this time.

03:31:26
<transcript>: What happened this time? Thank you, suds. Thank you so much.

03:31:29
<transcript>: What happened.

03:31:36
<transcript>: Runtime exception and it will start activity component whatever null pointer, Uri string.

03:31:36
<transcript>: exc

03:31:38
<transcript>: Exception.

03:31:44
<transcript>: Uri parse here view models player start.

03:31:51
<transcript>: But I did the thing. Oh, because it's asynchronous I bet is that the problem.

03:31:51
<transcript>: so

03:31:52
mecoupz: alright its 5pm ima out. see you next stream YOU adam

03:31:54
<transcript>: So players start could do it right there.

03:31:57
<transcript>: We could do it right there.

03:31:57
<transcript>: in player load

03:31:59
<transcript>: In player load stream.

03:32:03
<transcript>: Let's do it right. Let's do it right there.

03:32:07
<transcript>: So all of this just. I'm taking all this out.

03:32:11
<transcript>: And we're going to go down here and we're going to say.

03:32:11
<transcript>: player

03:32:15
<transcript>: Player start is going to do this code.

03:32:15
<transcript>: and then

03:32:19
<transcript>: And then these things are going to happen right here.

03:32:29
<transcript>: I don't know. What is this code down here? The load sources. When does that run.

03:32:29
<transcript>: i don't know

03:32:30
<transcript>: I don't know.

03:32:35
<transcript>: I don't know but I don't care let's try it.

03:32:41
<transcript>: All Right, Mikoups it's 05:00 p.m.. You're out. See you next time. I'll be back tomorrow.

03:32:41

<transcript>: Do you rage when you write C Plus Plus? I probably would.

03:32:52
<transcript>: what did it do

03:32:58
<transcript>: What did it do? Unable to match the desired swap behavior. Skipped 50 frames application too much work on main thread.

03:33:02
<transcript>: Well, it's still running. So we've gotten that far.

03:33:06
<transcript>: Stop. Rerun.

03:33:09
<transcript>: It's not showing anything.

03:33:09
<transcript>: are we still

<transcript>: Are we still streaming to the producer to the app? Yes. The ivs stream still has.

03:33:17
<transcript>: stuff

03:33:18
<transcript>: Stuff.

03:33:26
<transcript>: So the problem this time is what? Let's just rerun it.

03:33:31
<transcript>: What is the problem this time.

03:33:36
<transcript>: No adapter attached. Skipping layout.

03:33:41
<transcript>: Unable to match the desired swap behavior.

<transcript>: Let's do this log D thing. Whatever that is.

03:35:08
<transcript>: so

03:35:12
<transcript>: So player start right here. We're going to log.

03:35:15
<transcript>: Url value.

03:35:20
<transcript>: Tag, what's tag.

03:35:25
<transcript>: Okay, here's the message. I want to log.

<transcript>: is that

03:36:06
<transcript>: Is that it? No.

03:36:16
<transcript>: I don't know. I guess I need to debug again. I really thought I could get this done on today's stream the.

03:36:24
<transcript>: Debug player, start stream service. Here we go. Let's dive right there. Start debugger.

03:36:28
<transcript>: See if we get this far.

03:36:32
<transcript>: We got that far now.

03:36:35
<transcript>: Let's do this.

<transcript>: res

03:36:37
<transcript>: Resume.

03:36:37
<transcript>: how

03:36:43
<transcript>: How painful is it to watch me do this? Oh, git stream is failing is git stream failing.

03:36:46
<transcript>: I think Get stream is failing.

03:36:50
<transcript>: Did I restart it with the debugger or no.

03:36:53
<transcript>: Yes.

03:36:53
<transcript>: i

03:36:54
<transcript>: I did.

03:36:59
<transcript>: There it is. Error message. Which message is that.

03:37:07
<transcript>: Which exception? Network on main thread exception. Oh, network on main thread exception. Apparently, you can't do that.

03:37:12
<transcript>: Okay. So where can I do networking.

03:37:12
<transcript>: if

03:37:14
<transcript>: If not on the main thread.

03:37:17
<transcript>: Okay.

03:37:17
<transcript>: let's

03:37:21
<transcript>: Let's stop.

03:37:24
<transcript>: Stop it. Let's say.

03:37:24
<transcript>: kotlin

03:37:25
<transcript>: Kotlin.

03:37:28
<transcript>: Network, network.

03:37:28
<transcript>: on main

03:37:29
sudzusama: use viewModelScope.launch(Dispatchers.IO) { your code }

03:37:31
<transcript>: On main thread exception.

03:37:37
<transcript>: Use view. Model, scope. Launch dispatchers. I owe your code. Okay.

03:37:37
<transcript>: suds you're

03:37:41
<transcript>: Suds you're the MVP look at you coming in and teaching me kotlin.

03:37:45
<transcript>: You're too kind Sir You're too kind.

03:37:49
<transcript>: Let's just try what he said. Let's do this.

03:37:49
<transcript>: let's see

03:37:51
<transcript>: Let's see, Stream service.

03:37:58
<transcript>: View, model, scope? What's view? Model, scope.

03:38:03
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the Follow Scott keck, Warren.

03:38:07
<transcript>: How do I. What's view? Model scope? Is it just this.

03:38:12
<transcript>: Launch.

03:38:19
<transcript>: I'm in a view model right now. This scope view model, scope.

03:38:22
<transcript>: But launch is not okay.

03:38:26
<transcript>: Doesn't appear that I can use launch.

03:38:29
<transcript>: I can.

03:38:32
<transcript>: Just doesn't like, Oh.

03:38:32
<transcript>: it doesn't

03:38:34
<transcript>: It doesn't.

03:38:34
<transcript>: like this

03:38:38
<transcript>: Like this because I haven't imported it probably import.

03:38:41
sudzusama: use second yeah

03:38:42
<transcript>: All right. And then my code is all of this stuff.

03:38:44
<transcript>: Feels good.

03:38:47
<transcript>: Feels so nice.

03:38:51
<transcript>: Let's try it. I'm not even going to debug. I'm just going to try it.

03:38:54
<transcript>: Just try it.

03:38:58
<transcript>: Progress. No.

03:39:06
<transcript>: Cannot invoke set value on a background thread. How do I set value if not on a background thread.

03:39:12
sudzusama: is that livedata

03:39:17
<transcript>: Set value. Okay. So just anytime you assign a value of something can't do that. Okay. I don't actually need to do this. I'm just going to say this.

03:39:19
sudzusama: if yea then use postValue()

03:39:23
<transcript>: Who needs this url value thing? Let's just do this.

03:39:27
<transcript>: Okay.

03:39:30
<transcript>: Is that live data.

03:39:30
<transcript>: if yes

03:39:31
<transcript>: If Yes.

03:39:31
<transcript>: then

03:39:36
<transcript>: Then use post value. Okay. We'll try that next.

03:39:40
<transcript>: Unable to error Uri string what's the problem.

03:39:40
<transcript>: print

03:39:42
<transcript>: Print line.

03:39:42
<transcript>: stream

03:39:44
<transcript>: Stream URL.

03:39:47
<transcript>: Let's try that.

03:39:52
<transcript>: Hey, patio. Thank you so much for the follow. I really appreciate that. Follow.

03:39:52
<transcript>: i see

03:39:57
<transcript>: I see you, Kyle. Also, thank you for the follow.

03:40:02
<transcript>: Let's see if you have any post value.

03:40:02
<transcript>: error

03:40:04
<transcript>: Error.

03:40:06
<transcript>: Uri string.

03:40:10
<transcript>: So are we ever printing that line is my question.

03:40:10
<transcript>: null

03:40:13
<transcript>: Null. Okay, so it's null. Right here.

03:40:13
sudzusama: also try to use exception.printStackTrace() instead of println

03:40:18
<transcript>: Good to know git stream not working. Let's go to definition.

03:40:21
<transcript>: Go to declarations or usages.

03:40:21
<transcript>: let's

03:40:29
<transcript>: Let's see. So this code is not working. It's calling git stream. Execute. Let's print.

03:40:29
<transcript>: pri

03:40:31
<transcript>: Printlineresponse.

03:40:31
<transcript>: two string

03:40:33
<transcript>: Two string.

03:40:41
luisdaprogrammer: You say to much "ahhhh"

03:40:41
jpaddeo: Greetings from Argentina!

03:40:43
<transcript>: With the response to the api service get stream is.

03:40:49
<transcript>: Null no 200 message URL oh, okay.

03:40:49
<transcript>: it got

03:40:51
<transcript>: It got a 200.

03:40:55
<transcript>: So then what's the problem? Response body. Let's do this.

03:41:02
<transcript>: Line response, body.

03:41:05
<transcript>: Two string.

03:41:09
<transcript>: How about that.

03:41:12
<transcript>: I'm getting there.

03:41:12
<transcript>: i'm getting

03:41:16
fragaverage: You're still live?!

03:41:17
<transcript>: I'm getting there. J patio, welcome to Chat from Argentina.

03:41:17
<transcript>: welcome

03:41:22
<transcript>: Welcome, welcome, stream URL equals null. So if I hit this URL.

03:41:22
<transcript>: oh

03:41:27
<transcript>: Oh, it's not url. It's result. Data. Url. Oh.

03:41:39
<transcript>: So we got this. We got this. Watch this. It's the shape. It's our model. So if we go over here to our models, Stream is not this.

03:41:39
<transcript>: oh

03:41:46
<transcript>: Oh, how you nested? Oh, how do I do nested? Frag, I'm still alive. Are you still alive? We're still alive.

03:41:49
<transcript>: You say too much.

03:41:54
<transcript>: Exception. Print strike change instead of print line. Oh, interesting.

03:41:57
mono_nz: create more data classes

03:41:59
<transcript>: Hey, suds, do you know how I would create a model that's nested.

03:42:03
fragaverage: I'm still alive yes, just about. Trying to find a new headset!

03:42:07
<transcript>: Like it needs to be nested. Oh, just create more data classes. Of course. Data class.

03:42:10
<transcript>: Result? I don't know.

03:42:15
<transcript>: But you're saying I can just like nest them. Maybe Val.

03:42:15
<transcript>: data

03:42:17
<transcript>: Data.

03:42:19
<transcript>: Is a.

03:42:22
<transcript>: What was it.

03:42:29
<transcript>: So it goes result data url. So result has data which is a stream.

03:42:33
<transcript>: And then data.

03:42:37
<transcript>: This is a data.

03:42:40
<transcript>: Data class data has a.

03:42:44
<transcript>: Val Stream, which is a stream.

03:42:47
<transcript>: Like that.

03:42:52
<transcript>: Right. Yeah. The result is actually what I want.

03:42:56
glamshatterskull: what type of headset you looking for?

03:42:56
<transcript>: Okay.

03:42:56
<transcript>: let's

03:42:58
mono_nz: yep, nice

03:42:58
<transcript>: Let's go back.

03:42:58
<transcript>: here

03:43:01
<transcript>: Here. And this is going to get a result.

03:43:06
<transcript>: Refactor.

03:43:09
<transcript>: Shell code actions update Yes.

03:43:09
<transcript>: no

03:43:11
<transcript>: No.

03:43:13
<transcript>: Update I want to import.

03:43:13
<transcript>: want to

03:43:16
<transcript>: Want to import result.

03:43:19
<transcript>: Where are we importing stream. It needs to be result.

03:43:24
mightycore1: isn't the result also wrapped? so you need a result attribute?

03:43:25
<transcript>: So that is a result that returns.

03:43:26
fragaverage: @GlamShatterskull https://twitter.com/jamiedavies_dev/status/1641095571011248129

03:43:27
<transcript>: Okay.

03:43:27
<transcript>: so then

03:43:33
<transcript>: So then down here we should have an error. Let's see. This is result as well.

03:43:36
<transcript>: Then now it's going to be like, Oh.

03:43:36
<transcript>: there's no yeah

03:43:39
<transcript>: There's no. Yeah, no. Url. It's stream data.

03:43:39
<transcript>: result

03:43:43
<transcript>: Result no stream result.

03:43:45
<transcript>: Data.

03:43:47
<transcript>: Url no.

03:43:49
<transcript>: Is this.

03:43:51
<transcript>: Result.

03:44:03
<transcript>: Oh, streamed with stream data url. No. What? Oh, wait. I messed it up. Even one more time. I mess it up again because it's data stream.

03:44:03
<transcript>: oh my

03:44:05
<transcript>: Oh, my goodness.

03:44:05
<transcript>: result

03:44:10
<transcript>: Result data and then its URL so there's no stream so it goes result.

03:44:15
<transcript>: Is a data which has.

03:44:17
<transcript>: A.

03:44:17
<transcript>: no

03:44:18
<transcript>: No, what.

03:44:18
<transcript>: why is this

03:44:26
mightycore1: result -> data -> url :D

03:44:26
<transcript>: Why is this so confusing result data then URL the top level thing. This right here. We're going to call it stream has a result.

03:44:26
<transcript>: has

03:44:29
<transcript>: Has a shape like.

03:44:33
<transcript>: Result Data url thank You, Mighty core.

03:44:41
<transcript>: Need to resolve attribute yeah we got result and the shape of it is data. Data has a data which the shape of.

03:44:41
<transcript>: is

03:44:44
<transcript>: Is url. I don't know.

03:44:53
<transcript>: Can I not do that? Yeah, I can do that. Okay. And then that's URL string. So result. Data. Url.

03:44:53
<transcript>: why is this so

03:44:54
<transcript>: Why is this so hard.

03:44:54
<transcript>: so

03:44:58
<transcript>: So let's see resistream data URL no stream.

03:45:00
<transcript>: Result.

03:45:02
<transcript>: Data. Url. Right.

03:45:07
<transcript>: Like that.

03:45:11
<transcript>: That's hard.

03:45:16
<transcript>: It's no longer called Result. It's called Stream, right. I'm back to stream.

03:45:17
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:45:21
<transcript>: Stream.

03:45:21
<transcript>: okay

03:45:25
<transcript>: Okay. This is an error. And these I don't care about anymore.

03:45:25
<transcript>: but

03:45:28
<transcript>: But I guess we'll do this stream.

03:45:28
<transcript>: result

03:45:31
<transcript>: Result Data URL.

03:45:34
