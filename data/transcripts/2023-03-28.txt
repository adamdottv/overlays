10:04:03

<transcript>: The newer generations like P and Alpha, are strange.

10:15:17
<transcript>: Why don't I have the.

10:15:20
<transcript>: Phone push it into another device.

10:15:31
<transcript>: This was my favorite. They're like, Why can't we just have one phone.

10:15:37
<transcript>: That is specifically in the house. Primarily. Just enter the house.

10:15:52
<transcript>: How did you.

10:15:57
<transcript>: Like.

10:17:00
<transcript>: How I became present with Brian was simply, and I slid into a DM.

10:17:53
<transcript>: Commander.

10:18:07
<transcript>: Which is class legacy style.

10:18:15
<transcript>: Take all whatever self esteem and confidence you have in the game completely annihilate.

10:19:04
<transcript>: Your style.

10:20:06
<transcript>: The moment I start talking about.

10:20:06

10:20:07
<transcript>: Especially.

10:24:33

joostschuur: Chat is small

00:14:01
mono_nz: saw the notification, very excited if you're doing kotlin, omg. Big fan of kotlin

00:14:03
vimcerf: right now chat is hiding under the notifications

00:14:05
<transcript>: The reason the reason that I'm putting chat on the screen is it's small. Okay, it's too small. We'll make it bigger.

00:14:08
thdxr: can't see the chat too well not sure if it's worth it

00:14:09
<transcript>: The reason is that I'm streaming to YouTube.

00:14:12
<transcript>: Or live on YouTube.

00:14:13
aisebaxp: Opacity please... set to 50%

00:14:18
fragaverage: cringe

00:14:27
thdxr: cringe

00:14:30
thdxr: L

00:14:37
<transcript>: Opacity set to 50% cringe. What's going on right now? Are you guys just trolling me? Hello, YouTube people. There's probably nobody watching on YouTube. The reason I'm excited to put this on YouTube is that now I have 4k vods on YouTube. Would you stop it next.

00:14:40
<transcript>: 4k.

00:14:40
<transcript>: vods

00:14:43

vimcerf: peepoSad no longer twitch exclusive

00:15:09
aisebaxp: To see your pores in 4k

00:15:13
<transcript>: So that is my YouTube. You can watch it in 4k if you prefer to see all the pores on my face.

thdxr: I'm such a fan I'm watching you in both

00:15:15
smilingbig: hey everybody o/

00:15:16
<transcript>: No longer twitch exclusive.

00:15:22
joostschuur: No YouTube chat in the stream though

00:15:25
juniornascm: !yt

00:15:27
<transcript>: I'm such a fan. I'm watching you in both. Look, you guys do I need to check the YouTube chat. I'm going to check it like twice a stream. Let's see. Oh.

00:15:30
<transcript>: No, those are from yesterday.

00:15:30
<transcript>: i thought

00:15:35
<transcript>: I thought I had some chat messages in the YouTube chat. I do not.

00:15:35
<transcript>: oh

00:15:35
lesabotsy: @adamdotdev may I make a suggestion for the discord server?  It would be nice to have channels for learners.

00:15:42
zharkaa_: hello mr strimer and chat

00:15:46
<transcript>: Oh actually I don't have a YouTube chat up that was stale and there is chat message stuff. It's 30 seconds behind on YouTube because it's 4k listen.

00:15:47
joostschuur: Should be 4-5 of them

00:15:47
binajmen: Morning

00:15:49
dmdboi: So we all move to the yt chat?

00:15:55
<transcript>: I can't control that. It's just a YouTube thing. So it's 30 seconds behind. You can talk to me from the past.

00:15:57
<transcript>: Something.

00:15:57
<transcript>: jamie

00:16:01
smilingbig: never check the yt chat

00:16:08
mdsubuntu: 4k but font size 96

00:16:12
aisebaxp: They are 3 adamdev and non of them are you

00:16:13
fragaverage: YO DOXXED

00:16:14
<transcript>: Jamie. I see jamie's in there. I know who that actually is. That's frag. So we all moved to the YouTube. No. If you're in YouTube, you should move to twitch because I'm actually going to interact with people on twitch more. But I want to store the vods.

00:16:16
<transcript>: On YouTube.

00:16:16
<transcript>: i actually change

00:16:17
fragaverage: SCAMMER DOXER

00:16:23
<transcript>: I actually changed. Oh, I'm so sorry, Jamie. I'm sorry. I said it again. Twice. The atom watching on Both. That's funny.

00:16:31
smilingbig: KEKW

00:16:33
dmdboi: An Adam per monitor

00:16:36
<transcript>: So can I not pop out the chat and have just this consistent URL? It makes a new URL every single time. That is the dumbest thing I've ever seen. So now I got to open that every time. Okay, cool.

00:16:42
smilingbig: FragAverage LUL

00:16:42
<transcript>: I redid my overlays to be in 4k that's what I did yesterday.

00:16:47
thdxr: scammer

00:16:49
thdxr: L

00:16:49
<transcript>: So I redid my overlays now they're in four K and I'm streaming.

00:16:49
<transcript>: in

00:16:50
<transcript>: In four K to YouTube.

00:16:50
<transcript>: and

00:16:51
thdxr: cringe

00:16:54
<transcript>: And I'm streaming in one thousand and eighty P to Twitch.

00:16:54
<transcript>: so

00:16:57
<transcript>: So would you stop dax? Would you stop.

00:16:57
<transcript>: cr

00:17:02
<transcript>: Cringe, the l's. Okay, let's stop talking about.

00:17:02
<transcript>: youtube

00:17:04
<transcript>: Youtube, and whatever else.

00:17:10
<transcript>: We're working on rebate today. I'm very excited.

00:17:16
<transcript>: Just very excited. We're going to be doing rebase stuff on stream more often.

00:17:29
aisebaxp: !youtube

00:17:31
<transcript>: Probably best for Sat me's. If I'm being honest, I'll get more done for stat muse when I'm doing it off stream and I'm just kind of working on some parts that are I'm going to have to hide my screen so much with stat muse because I'm doing all this database connectivity stuff.

00:17:37
<transcript>: Yeah. So we're going to build some rebase mobile apps.

00:17:39
aisebaxp: !yt

00:17:40
<transcript>: We decided not doing the React Native thing.

00:17:40
<transcript>: so

00:17:47
<transcript>: So we're not doing Expo. We're going to build these in straight kotlin and Swift.

00:17:49
<transcript>: And.

00:17:49
aisebaxp: !social

00:17:52
<transcript>: I hope we don't regret it.

00:17:53
fragaverage: expo is king

00:17:57
<transcript>: Social, YouTube. Yeah, sorry, I don't have commands, do I for any of that.

00:18:05
mono_nz: kotlin <3

00:18:06
<transcript>: They are three Adam dev. And none of them are you. Oh, I'm sorry. It's Adam dev. So it's like YouTube.

00:18:06
<transcript>: com

00:18:08
<transcript>: Com.

00:18:08
<transcript>: adam

00:18:08
adamdotdev: youtube.com/@adamdotdev

00:18:09
aisebaxp: Ok

00:18:11
<transcript>: Adam dev. Just like that.

00:18:12
aisebaxp: Got it

00:18:14
binajmen: Which one you'll start with? Kotlin or Swift?

00:18:15
mdsubuntu: twitch also support 4k stream, I want to see 4k Adam here please

00:18:15
<transcript>: So we're going to build the mobile app twice which kind of sucks.

00:18:15
<transcript>: but

00:18:19
<transcript>: But for what the app is, there's not a lot of surface area.

00:18:19
<transcript>: it's pretty narrow

00:18:22
fragaverage: yt banner is best

00:18:26
<transcript>: It's pretty narrow, but it's heavy on the interaction and animation and native stuff I got to do.

00:18:26
<transcript>: so we're going to

00:18:28
<transcript>: So we're going to do it the hard way.

00:18:28
charafmrah: Flutter wasn’t considered either?

00:18:36
<transcript>: Which one will we start with kotler? Swift. We should probably start with kotlin actually, because I have zero kotlin experience. I've actually built some stuff in Swift.

00:18:36
<transcript>: hadar

00:18:40
puccababy: Well *I* replaced all the baked in display string in a react app with JSON translations. Web dev is all rock-n-roll. Swap?

00:18:43
<transcript>: Hadar thanks so much for that follow. I've built some stuff in Swiss the Sat me zap I built in Swift.

00:18:43
<transcript>: i have no

00:18:45
<transcript>: I have no kotlin experience.

00:18:45
<transcript>: and

00:18:57
<transcript>: And it'd probably be a good symbolic gesture to start with kotlin because I've only ever built apps for iOS and never gotten to the Android part. It's always been like I'll get to it and never have.

00:18:57
<transcript>: so

00:19:00
<transcript>: So should probably start with kotlin.

00:19:00
<transcript>: what do we think

00:19:05
<transcript>: What do we think? Expo is King? Yeah, I know. Expo is pretty great. It does feel nice.

00:19:05
<transcript>: to

00:19:10
<transcript>: To I don't know it feels like you're building on.

00:19:11
thdxr: is anyone in here an Android dev

00:19:17
<transcript>: Sorry. I just realized I missed a big message. It feels like you're building on what was I talking about.

00:19:17
<transcript>: what was i talking

00:19:22
<transcript>: What was I talking about? No. Youtube chat in the stream. Yeah, no YouTube chat in the stream.

00:19:42
<transcript>: Oh, Expo. Feels like you're building like a next app is what I was trying to say. I'm such a fan. I'm watching you in both. Hey, everybody, I missed a couple of chat messages here and I cannot miss a chat message. The one that I missed was mentioned. Me. May I make a suggestion for the discord server? Lesa says it would be nice to have channels for learners.

00:19:49
<transcript>: Learners like people who want to learn how to stream or just learn software. Dev.

00:19:54
<transcript>: Because we kind of have a mixed message going right now on watch, Dev.

00:19:54
<transcript>: it's kind of

00:19:55
<transcript>: It's kind of both.

00:19:55
<transcript>: and

00:20:03
<transcript>: And I kind of want to create, like, a course, like a free course, but a course on streaming your work.

00:20:03
<transcript>: chromate

00:20:04
jan5u: why is the colors little different on yt? 🤔

00:20:05
<transcript>: Chromate. Thanks so much for the follow.

00:20:10
<transcript>: Streaming your work and.

00:20:10
<transcript>: i guess

00:20:11
<transcript>: I guess.

00:20:11
<transcript>: there's just so much

00:20:13
<transcript>: There's just so much I want to explain.

00:20:13
<transcript>: and

00:20:18
<transcript>: And lay out in terms of my journey here on twitch and now YouTube.

00:20:21
fragaverage: @Jan5u 4k, less compression ?

00:20:22
mono_nz: kotlin multiplatform is great, can deploy the android business logic to ios as a cocoapod. then only need to do swiftui. Its pretty sweet

00:20:34
<transcript>: There's other people Besides developers, not just developers. There's like designers and other knowledge workers who set it at desk. And people would probably enjoy watching them stream. There's just so many hurdles to get into it. And I would love to help.

00:20:38
<transcript>: Break down those hurdles, so yeah, I don't know.

00:20:42
<transcript>: On the broad side.

00:20:42
<transcript>: i have more

00:20:46
thdxr: @mono_nz I was wondering about this. @adamdotdev what do you think of that

00:20:46
<transcript>: I have more bandwidth than ever we've got to live in nanny, got more time.

00:20:50
<transcript>: To actually work than I have had for years.

00:20:56
<transcript>: On the dark side? The bright side, the dark side, the good side, the badset on the bad side.

00:20:57
thdxr: was wondering if we could share the parts that talk to the API

00:21:01
<transcript>: I have more ideas and more things I want to do with my time than ever. Okay.

00:21:01
<transcript>: zark

00:21:03
<transcript>: Zarka, Hello.

00:21:03
<transcript>: hello

00:21:07
binajmen: Why not Tauri?

00:21:08
<transcript>: Hello, Mr. Streamer in Chat. Should be four to five of them.

00:21:08
<transcript>: four or five

00:21:10
<transcript>: Four or five of the channels.

00:21:18
<transcript>: Never check the YouTube chat 4k, but font size 96 is that too big or too small.

00:21:22
mono_nz: @thdxr half way thru my ios app doing it now, its not too bad. android shipped and done!

00:21:24
<transcript>: Okay.

00:21:24
<transcript>: people

00:21:27
<transcript>: People trying to get their MacBook.

00:21:27
<transcript>: and not

00:21:29
<transcript>: And not winning.

00:21:32
<transcript>: 4k less compression.

00:21:33
mdsubuntu: too big :D

00:21:38
<transcript>: The colors are different. Oh, yeah. Probably from less compression.

00:21:43
<transcript>: Jan. Five? Welcome to my chat? Welcome, welcome.

00:21:46
<transcript>: Flutter wasn't considered. In what's flutter.

00:21:46
<transcript>: sorry

00:21:50
<transcript>: Sorry, Charlotte. I don't know what flutter is.

00:21:50
<transcript>: oh

00:22:04
<transcript>: Oh, twitch supports 4k stream are you sure about that atomizer? Thank you so much for that follow. I don't think twitch supports well, twitch doesn't support over like 6000 bitrate. You can actually push it up to like 8500.

00:22:06
joostschuur: 4k for partners?

00:22:11
<transcript>: But they don't support enough bitrate to really justify four K. I think if I stream to 4k on twitch, it'd be pretty.

00:22:16
<transcript>: Scuffed is the word. I believe. Scuffed.

00:22:20
<transcript>: Is that Gen Z slang for bad.

00:22:21
fragaverage: 4k 15fps maybe LUL

00:22:24
lesabotsy: @adamdotdev both I guess :/ I'm learning software development, just looking for place to hangout and ask questions. I'll stream on day when I'm good enough.

00:22:25
<transcript>: Youtube banner is best I don't even remember what it is.

00:22:25
<transcript>: flutter

00:22:26
dmdboi: Nailed it

00:22:35
<transcript>: Flutter? What is flutter? I've heard of flutter. I replaced all the baked in display string and React app with json translations. Web dev is all rock and roll swap.

00:22:39
<transcript>: Swap, what? Puka.

00:22:43
<transcript>: Is anyone in here? An Android dev. Great question, dex.

00:22:44
jan5u: not much bitrate needed on software dev stream

00:22:45
<transcript>: Great question.

00:22:50
smilingbig: not sure if that's gen z though LUL

00:22:52
thdxr: @lesabotsy just ask in the programming channel

00:22:53
puccababy: Swap for anything more fun... at all.

00:22:55
<transcript>: Kotlin multiplatform is great can deploy the Android business logic to iOS as a cocoa pod then only need to do Swift UI really.

00:22:58
<transcript>: Interesting mono. Thank you for that tip.

00:23:04
<transcript>: I was wondering about this. What do you think of that? I'd never heard of that.

00:23:10
<transcript>: So you can make okay so we can write.

00:23:10
<transcript>: the

00:23:12
<transcript>: The business logic.

00:23:12
<transcript>: i don't

00:23:15
<transcript>: I don't think I know what business logic is, by the way.

00:23:17
haydar1010: Good day!

00:23:21
thdxr: https://kotlinlang.org/lp/mobile/

00:23:25
<transcript>: I've heard that term so many times in my career, and I still don't know what it is. Johann, thank you for the follow. I don't know if it's actually johann, but it felt better than Johan.

00:23:25
<transcript>: let me know

00:23:28
<transcript>: Let me know let me know if I said it wrong.

00:23:28
<transcript>: so

00:23:29
<transcript>: So.

00:23:29
<transcript>: we can sort of

00:23:33
johan_dupl: Yep, close enough :P

00:23:35
charafmrah: Flutter is a multi platform framework by Google. Now used more than React Native. But I guess for your case where animations are very important, native makes more sense.

00:23:48
<transcript>: We can sort of package up the business logic, and it can be installed into our iOS app. It's a cocoa pod, and then we just have to do the ui. I'm trying to think of what is business logic in the front end of this app. Feels like it's all just ui. It's all just pretty animations. I could be wrong.

00:23:52
smkpurplehaze: will chat gpt kill ios development or web development ? what do u think about this situation ?

00:23:58
<transcript>: Max, I'm totally open to it. Wondering if we could share the parts that talk to the api. Oh, yeah. Okay. That's business logic. That makes sense. Yeah, that sounds cool. We'll do that.

00:23:58
<transcript>: why not

00:23:58
thdxr: think you can try it: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-mobile-setup.html

00:24:02
fragaverage: @SmkPurpleHaze Nope

00:24:04
<transcript>: Why not tori? Well, Ben Adjminn. I don't know what Tory is. I think I've heard of that, too.

00:24:04
<transcript>: but

00:24:07
<transcript>: But tell me more say more words.

00:24:09
<transcript>: Nailed it.

00:24:10
thdxr: if you hate it then you just don't have to use it for the iOS part

00:24:12
<transcript>: Nailed? What.

00:24:14
<transcript>: 4k for partners.

00:24:14
<transcript>: i don't think

00:24:16
aisebaxp: Is nice the YY thing so I can leave the phone and just use the TV

00:24:18
<transcript>: I don't think you get more bitrate if you're a partner.

00:24:18
<transcript>: i don't

00:24:19
binajmen: more words

00:24:20
<transcript>: I don't think.

00:24:23
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:24:27
magerdev: @SmkPurpleHaze not in your lifetime.

00:24:28
captaincorkes: i don't have 1k Adam bucks because is spent 100 to highlight this message :(

00:24:31
<transcript>: Halfway through my iOS up doing it now. Not too bad Android shipped and done. Okay, we're starting with kotlin. It's decided.

00:24:31
basileus__: is 8 equal to D?

00:24:37
joostschuur: No, looks like partners don;’t get it either

00:24:42
<transcript>: Too big 4k for partners. Four K. Fifteen frames. Yeah. If you guys are okay with 15 frames a second, then sure. I'll send four K to Twitch.

00:24:44
<transcript>: Both, I guess.

00:24:44
<transcript>: i'm learning

00:24:47
binajmen: "Tauri is a framework for building tiny, blazing fast binaries for all major desktop platforms."

00:24:52
johan_dupl: Why not flutter for both?

00:25:00
magerdev: unless your only skill is html and css then yes chatGPT will replace you

00:25:04
<transcript>: I'm learning software development, just looking for place to hang out and ask questions. I'll stream on day when I'm good enough. Yeah. No, I think Watch dev is a great place for that. The whole point of watching dev is like a place for streamers to make a little home on Watch dev, where they don't have to have their own discord server. They can just kind of plant themselves in the Watch dev server. And then for all the people who, like, hanging out with.

00:25:04
<transcript>: those strea

00:25:09
binajmen: "blazing fast"... looks like ThePrime was writing the description of Tauri. It is Rust based ;)

00:25:13
<transcript>: Those streamers to have one place, and they kind of overlap and cross pollinates and hang out together because there's a lot of people that watch the same streams.

00:25:13
<transcript>: so yeah i think

00:25:15
joostschuur: @captaincorkes if this redeem wins, you can have the MacBook

00:25:19
kociqq: ayezeeHey

00:25:28
<transcript>: So, yeah, I think it's a great place, lesa. Already. Now we could make some more channels for sure. Dax is a bit of a channel minimalist. And he deleted all my fun channels. So you can take it up with DAX. Daxites some pretty good channels in there. We had a keyboard channel. Still bitter that I lost my keyboard channel.

00:25:28
<transcript>: because

00:25:35
joostschuur: Worth a try

00:25:37
thdxr: so glad I killed the keyboard channel

00:25:41
fragaverage: Hold up, whos this Dax guy throwing his weight around

00:25:42
<transcript>: Because I was very excited about it. I even made I think I wrote a message in the keyboard channel that was like, this channel is enough reason to create this whole server for me. And then you deleted it just like a cold hearted killer.

00:25:49
<transcript>: Not much Bitrated needed on software Dev stream. Oh, maybe not. Maybe I can do 4k on twitch. I'll look into it.

00:25:53
<transcript>: Not sure if that's Gen. Z, though. Okay.

00:25:53
<transcript>: the program

00:25:57
<transcript>: The programming channel. There you go, lesa. It's the programming channel.

00:25:57
<transcript>: dax has this

00:26:00
binajmen: They have a Tauri Mobile baking btw ;)

00:26:00
kociqq: ayezeeSAD

00:26:04
<transcript>: Dax has this all planned out and people are trying to win MacBooks again swap for anything more fun and all.

00:26:12
<transcript>: Oh, swap swap? What we're doing? Like swap jobs today. I got you.

00:26:12
<transcript>: yeah

00:26:14
dmdboi: 6 points away from winning a MacBook

00:26:16
<transcript>: Yeah, you know Android Dev.

00:26:24
thdxr: Me and Liz are doing something ridiculous tomorrow. We're starting to do monthly family meetings and we're going to do it on Twitch

00:26:27
<transcript>: Because we could swap. What am I doing again? What are you doing? Web Dev is all wrong. Oh, replaced baked in display strings with json translations. Let's not swap. I think I'll take my job today.

00:26:28
magerdev: oh so watch.dev, that would be a place I can  join and occasionallty announce mty stream go lives?

00:26:30
<transcript>: I think I like my job a little better.

00:26:32
mono_nz: separate ui from 'business logic' -put all your repositories, viewmodels, networking, caching etc in its own kotlin multiplatform module. then deploy that as a cocoapod. but of a sweat to setup, but seems nice so far. quiite a few kotlin libs are already multiplatform like ktor (networking)

00:26:33
captaincorkes: @joostschuur <3

00:26:34
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:26:34
<transcript>: man

00:26:36
puccababy: hahah darn it

00:26:41
fragaverage: @thdxr Here for this!

00:26:42
<transcript>: Man, sometime my chat looks totally different today. Did my mods, like change the display settings in my chat or something? It just looks so different.

00:26:42
<transcript>: i don't have

00:26:49
<transcript>: I don't have one K Adam Bucks because I spent 100 to highlight this message. I'm so sorry, captain.

00:26:49
<transcript>: maybe

00:26:51
stroopwafel26: ohai

00:26:53
<transcript>: Maybe save him up save him up for next time.

00:26:53
<transcript>: redemption

00:27:03
fragaverage: Either Chat got an update, or BTTV did something to it

00:27:05
<transcript>: Redemption. Thanks so much for that prime sub. I appreciate that early on a Tuesday morning, I'm getting coffee today with Jordan, and I think maybe somebody else maliro somebody else was from the area.

00:27:10
magerdev: reported mods for tampering

00:27:14
<transcript>: So, yeah, getting coffee right after this stream. Got my knife pants on the pants that I wear in public.

00:27:14
<transcript>: i'm realizing that

00:27:15
<transcript>: I'm realizing that.

00:27:15
<transcript>: my

00:27:17
vapor__dev: Actual coffee or “coffee”

00:27:24
<transcript>: My notifications jump in front of chat which is annoying so nobody do anything while people are talking. Okay. Like if people are talking.

00:27:24
<transcript>: don't do

00:27:26
vapor__dev: White tee lfgo

00:27:31
joostschuur: Maybe that’ll be my thing. I’ll redeem and pledge the MB to someone different every time

00:27:33
<transcript>: Don't do anything that causes notifications. That'd be great until I fix it. I don't know how to fix it, though. I need David. I need David to tell me how to fix it.

00:27:33
<transcript>: david

00:27:42
<transcript>: David, my designer friend, David. Okay, close enough. Let's see kotlin lang Mobile. Okay, we're going to get started on kotlin. That's what we're doing today.

00:27:48
<transcript>: Good day. Hadar welcome to Chat. Welcome, welcome.

00:27:48
<transcript>: also jo

00:27:51
<transcript>: Also, johann. Close enough. Okay. Close enough.

00:27:51
<transcript>: i'll take close enough

00:27:54
<transcript>: I'll take close enough. Welcome to Chat. Johann.

00:27:54
<transcript>: flutter

00:27:56
lightmeup12: cookin up transactions for consistent IoT

00:28:09
<transcript>: Flutter is a multiplatform framework by Google now used more than React Native, but I guess for your use case where animations are very important, native makes more sense. Yeah. I think we were moving away from React Native because we felt like it's getting in the way of all the animation stuff.

00:28:17
<transcript>: Smoked Purple haze. Welcome to my Chat. Will chat. Gbt kill iOS development or web development? What do you think about this situation.

00:28:17
<transcript>: i think

00:28:21
<transcript>: I think. Sir. Demier, thank you for that follow.

00:28:21
<transcript>: i think

00:28:23
<transcript>: I think that.

00:28:23
<transcript>: it's all very exciting

00:28:24
<transcript>: It's all very exciting.

00:28:33
<transcript>: It's just all still very early, but it's already had actual impact, so I don't worry that this is all just a bunch of hype.

00:28:33
<transcript>: a

00:28:35
<transcript>: Ai has already changed our job.

00:28:35
<transcript>: we get these

00:28:44
magerdev: what are you moving into instead of react native for animation?

00:28:47
<transcript>: We get these wonderful tools now copilot Chad gbt it makes learning new languages and new. Like, I'm so excited for learning kotlin with Chat gbt by my side. And you guys chat Twitch.

00:28:52
<transcript>: Twitch Chat GPT.

00:28:52
<transcript>: i've got both

00:29:01
<transcript>: I've got both of you. I've got twitch, chat, some real human experience, and I've got chat gbt filling in the gaps.

00:29:01
<transcript>: so

00:29:02
uberrick: Hey! Java rip :D

00:29:03
smilingbig: LUL nailed it

00:29:04
<transcript>: So I think it's really exciting. It's helping us as well.

00:29:04
<transcript>: i think it'll

00:29:09
<transcript>: I think it'll make it easier to build stuff solo for sure.

00:29:09
<transcript>: it's going to be really

00:29:11
<transcript>: It's going to be really cool.

00:29:17
<transcript>: As this stuff develops out and gets more integrated into our actual tooling and our workflow.

00:29:17
<transcript>: how

00:29:20
<transcript>: How quickly we'll be able to probably, I think.

00:29:20
<transcript>: i'm just

00:29:28
<transcript>: I'm just assuming here, but I think we'll be able to build out stuff like as indie hackers or whatever. Like as a solo Dev very fast.

00:29:34
<transcript>: And the design part should just get easier and better. Like tailwind helped a lot for people who don't have a good design sense.

00:29:34
<transcript>: i think this

00:29:42
<transcript>: I think this is going to be the next evolution of that like being able to build nice user friendly interfaces if you need to.

00:29:50
<transcript>: Faster than ever. Yeah, I think it's just going to help a lot. I don't know that it's going to kill anything.

00:29:55
<transcript>: Not in the near term, but it's going to enhance it's going to make things better for us.

00:29:55
<transcript>: i do think

00:29:57
<transcript>: I do think.

00:30:00
<transcript>: I hesitate to be like.

00:30:00
<transcript>: it's not going to

00:30:01
<transcript>: It's not going to.

00:30:01
<transcript>: kill

00:30:16
<transcript>: Kill anything because I do think we get a little overboard with the like, it's just going to enhance productivity. It's not going to affect anybody's jobs. It's probably going to affect some people's jobs. It sucks that the timing is like when all the free money disappeared.

00:30:16
<transcript>: and funding

00:30:19
<transcript>: And funding is getting tighter and.

00:30:19
<transcript>: actual

00:30:29
<transcript>: Actual businesses have to create actual revenue. And so they're cutting and laying off tons of people. So you got all these devs being laid off and entering into this competitive.

00:30:29
<transcript>: hiring

00:30:49
<transcript>: Hiring market where it's kind of skewed toward the employers. Now all that happened and then AI is going to make people who still work at those places more productive. And then they're going to say maybe we don't need to hire back as many people. I think that's a reality for some places they won't hire the headcount that they had prior. I think we maybe reached peak software develop.

00:30:49
<transcript>: development employ

00:30:57
<transcript>: Development, employment. I don't know. Maybe that's false. Dax would say that's a pessimistic thing to say. Dax, come in and say something positive. Make that sound better.

00:30:57
<transcript>: but i

00:30:58
<transcript>: But I do think.

00:30:58
<transcript>: we still

00:31:04
<transcript>: We still don't know much of anything. It's early, so don't get too worried.

00:31:06
<transcript>: It's not the other world. Things are going to be.

00:31:06
<transcript>: better

00:31:09
basileus__: I work with some pretty clever people, and they're really not utilizing chatgpt that much

00:31:09
<transcript>: Better as devs for a while.

00:31:11
<transcript>: Okay.

00:31:11
<transcript>: i think you can

00:31:18
rvnn: This one feels differnt though

00:31:20
<transcript>: I think you can try it. Kotlin lang multi platform mobile setup. Okay, we're going to copy that link and bring it over here. So I'm not looking for it later.

00:31:26
<transcript>: So now I'm probably like five minutes behind on twitch, which means I'm like 100 minutes behind on YouTube.

00:31:26
<transcript>: let's see

00:31:27
<transcript>: Let's see.

00:31:33
<transcript>: If you hate it, then you just don't have to use it for the iOS part, okay.

00:31:34
thdxr: I use ChatGPT as much as possible

00:31:36
thdxr: every day

00:31:38
<transcript>: It's nice the yy thing so I can leave the phone and just use the TV.

00:31:41
<transcript>: The Why thing.

00:31:41
<transcript>: the

00:31:44
charafmrah: All these companies will now need developers to deploy ChatGPT for their own products and systems

00:31:46
<transcript>: The why, why? Thing. Oh, the twitch chat being on my screen. That's nice.

00:31:46
<transcript>: more

00:31:49
<transcript>: More words. Not in your lifetime.

00:31:56
oleksii_lisovyi: Heyo 0/

<transcript>: I don't have one can. Okay. I already read. That is eight equal to D. What are we talking about? I feel like lately I feel like you guys just write like, gibberish messages. I feel like dax is running.

00:32:00
<transcript>: like

00:32:01
<transcript>: Like.

00:32:02
basileus__: I use it too, just today I got it to write a couple things for me

00:32:14
<transcript>: A silent campaign that I'm not aware of to get everyone to just drive me crazy with messages I don't understand that are almost things I could understand, but I don't quite understand it. And I start feeling like I'm going crazy.

00:32:14
atomizer: AI chat LUL

00:32:20
rvnn: lol

00:32:20
vimcerf: no, Adam has a good point here

00:32:20
fragaverage: @thdxr he's onto you

00:32:22
dmdboi: Mutiny

00:32:27
thdxr: Adam....we're not writing gibberish messages.... something is just wrong with your brain....

00:32:28
bishopdev: @adamdotdev You are going crazy .. you're on twitch

00:32:30
<transcript>: The word for what dax is doing, like a shadow campaign. Is that what I'm trying to come up with? I feel like he's got some kind of, like, conspiracy going. And you guys are all writing incoherent messages. What is is eight equal to D mean, Basilis.

00:32:30
<transcript>: it could

00:32:30
oleksii_lisovyi: unlucky

00:32:33
smilingbig: KEKW

00:32:34
vapor__dev: Psyops

00:32:37
rvnn: dude your video is so crispy!!!

00:32:38
magerdev: not sure if I missed the answer to this one so ima repeat one more time, sorry if its a bother: "what are you moving into instead of react native for animation?

00:32:38
joostschuur: Dax definitely does not pay us to watch your stream, I don’t know how that rumour got started

00:32:39
<transcript>: It could be an honest mistake. You might have wrote a message that you thought I would understand. I don't. And now I'm just pinning it to all these messages. I keep saying that don't make any sense to me.

00:32:39
<transcript>: okay

00:32:42
<transcript>: Okay. It looks like partners don't get it either.

00:32:42
<transcript>: tari is a framework

00:32:45
basileus__: Kappa try checking if 8 is equal to D in javascript

00:32:46
thdxr: LOL

00:32:53
<transcript>: Tari is a framework for building tiny, blazing, fast binaries for all desktop desktop platforms. Well, this is all mobile, so I don't think we need tari. Why not flutter for both.

00:32:53
<transcript>: i

00:32:57
<transcript>: I think flutters had like more of what we had with React Native, right.

00:33:00
thdxr: Adam is so innocent

00:33:02
<transcript>: Okay.

00:33:02
<transcript>: blazing nice

00:33:06
<transcript>: Blazing nice loser. The promise right in the description of Tory. It is rest based.

00:33:06
<transcript>: if

00:33:08
subwaytime_: Tauri is just insanely great!

00:33:08
thdxr: "what is 8 equals D"

00:33:10
fragaverage: Its a front

00:33:11
<transcript>: If this redeem wins, you can have the macbook. Oh yoast is donating his redeem.

00:33:12
dmdboi: So I win a MacBook but the message says NOT, is that a bug?

00:33:14
<transcript>: Co. C what's going on.

00:33:16
decalibrate: Triple equals

00:33:17
stroopwafel26: @thdxr hahaha

00:33:19
<transcript>: So glad I killed the keyboard channel.

00:33:19
<transcript>: and

00:33:22
<transcript>: And is that half hour by name.

00:33:22
<transcript>: who's this axe guy

00:33:28
<transcript>: Who's this axe guy throwing his weight around. Okay, I got to scroll. That's a bunch of redeems.

00:33:28
<transcript>: okay

00:33:28
oleksii_lisovyi: So a bit of JRE souce today?

00:33:34
<transcript>: Okay. Oh, wow. It just jumped me to the bottom. Should I just stick with it and just assume I missed nothing.

00:33:34
<transcript>: maybe

00:33:38
smilingbig: yea LUL

00:33:41
<transcript>: Maybe I missed nothing. Did I miss nothing? We're going to go with it. So I win a macbook. But the message says not. Is that a bug.

00:33:45
uberrick: missed nothing all good :D

00:33:50
stroopwafel26: you missed: stroop is here!

00:33:51
<transcript>: Your video is so crispy. Thank you so much. I got to make sure there's no welcome to chats I need to do.

00:33:51
<transcript>: you

00:33:52
stroopwafel26: but maybe not

00:33:59
magerdev: flutter uses its own rendering engine so it could definitely be more suitable for animation heavy projects

00:34:01
<transcript>: You are going crazy. You're on twitch. It's true, Bishop. We're not writing gibberish messages. Something is just wrong with your brain. Stop it. I really feel like it.

00:34:04
<transcript>: Ai chat.

00:34:04
<transcript>: did

00:34:08
dofha: 0.1% is too high

00:34:08
<transcript>: Did I miss any nude chatters? I just have to welcome every single person.

00:34:08
<transcript>: and all these

00:34:10
joostschuur: You missed me making a joke, but don’t worry, I have more of those

00:34:14
<transcript>: And all these companies will now need developers to deploy chat gbt for their own products and systems.

00:34:22
<transcript>: I work with some pretty clever people and they're really not utilizing gbt that much.

00:34:26
laytanl_: Yo! Missed yesterday BibleThump anything happen?

00:34:27
<transcript>: I definitely think we're hyping up.

00:34:27
<transcript>: to an ext

00:34:31
rvnn: Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1  7 bits ain't a byte

00:34:31
<transcript>: To an extent, there's going to be stuff that we're hyping up that's not going to come true.

00:34:33
<transcript>: Because.

00:34:33
<transcript>: oh alan

00:34:37
imshootex: How many wills will Will Smith smith if Will Smith will smith wills?

00:34:37
<transcript>: Oh, alan's, here. That's what we do on Twitter and other places.

00:34:37
<transcript>: arv

00:34:44
<transcript>: Arvin, thank you so much for those bits. I appreciate those bits. Seven bits. Ain't a bite.

00:34:44
<transcript>: that

00:34:46
<transcript>: That's funny.

00:34:46
<transcript>: stroop wa

00:34:53
<transcript>: Stroop. Waffles here. Okay. Have I caught up? I missed a few big messages and I really want to read them.

00:34:57
rvnn: oh i forgot to add the extra bit lol

00:35:00
<transcript>: It's so hard to read with all these MacBook redeems. Am I going to have to make it more point.

00:35:00
<transcript>: and higher

00:35:02
fragaverage: Cheer1  the missing bit!

00:35:02
<transcript>: And higher chance of winning.

00:35:02
<transcript>: maybe

00:35:03
<transcript>: Maybe.

00:35:06
<transcript>: I should do that.

00:35:11
<transcript>: Frag, thank you so much for that bit. The missing bit. Look at that. We have a bite. Now.

00:35:16
rvnn: lol nice

00:35:21
<transcript>: Daxby and Liz are doing something ridiculous. Tomorrow, we're starting to do monthly family meetings. And we're going to do it on twitch. Are you serious? We used to do family meetings.

00:35:22
kociqq: 100% winning chance for me please? 😳

00:35:22
oleksii_lisovyi: Bited

00:35:23
stroopwafel26: make it 30k for a 100% chance at winning a macbook, i have 30k

00:35:27
uberrick: the overlay popup said 6 bits I think

00:35:32
<transcript>: When it was just me and my wife and my eldest, asa. We did family meetings. We stopped doing them when archer came along. I don't know why, but you're doing it on Twitch.

00:35:32
<transcript>: now

00:35:39
puccababy: ChatGPT is more of an issue with my other hat on (writer, novels). Many publishers have had to close their subs because of the volume of 'generated' novels being submitted. Impossible for editors to keep up, so they just closed their doors to new writers.

00:35:39
<transcript>: Now, how authentic will this be? Dax? Will it be the real you and Liz? Or will you be acting.

00:35:49
<transcript>: Major dev. So watch that dev. That would be a place I can join and occasionally announce my stream. Go live. Yes. Establish a presence there. And we might just give you a channel.

00:35:49
<transcript>: we might

00:35:50
thdxr: I don't know how to act

00:35:51
<transcript>: We might just major.

00:35:56
<transcript>: Okay, I got to just scroll. Just going to skip over everything.

00:36:07
smilingbig: thdxr will you be wearing camo?

00:36:09
<transcript>: Actual coffee or coffee? No actual coffee. Alan, I'm going to have actual coffee today. Which is ironic given I filmed a little teaser about coffee this morning. That's kind of ironic that I'm having coffee. Okay.

00:36:10
joostschuur: I never know what to do with my hands

00:36:12
<transcript>: Layton's here? Missed yesterday? Anything happened.

00:36:12
<transcript>: unfort

00:36:13
rvnn: Twitch needs to revamp the chat sidebar, add some filters, or maybe a second tab for bot commands

00:36:14
<transcript>: Unfortunately no.

00:36:22
<transcript>: I missed you making a joke. Yoast, no, you have more of them. Okay, 0.1% is too high. Dafa. It's actually zero 1%.

00:36:27
<transcript>: Did anybody win? I'm assuming when somebody wins, you guys are going to yell at me really loud.

00:36:30
<transcript>: Okay.

00:36:32
<transcript>: Let's get to.

00:36:33
<transcript>: tori

00:36:33
<transcript>: tori is just

00:36:38
<transcript>: Tori is just insanely. Great. I'm so innocent. Why am I so innocent? Dax.

00:36:38
<transcript>: dax

00:36:39
thdxr: @smilingbig hahah

00:36:40
fragaverage: I've won like 6 times, you take no notice

00:36:44
<transcript>: Dax definitely does not pay us to watch your stream. I don't know how that rumor got started. I see the joke now. Yos.

00:36:50
<transcript>: What are you moving to instead of React native for animation, so major.

00:36:50
<transcript>: i don't know

00:37:00
<transcript>: I don't know. We're just going to do it in native so Swift and kotlin and I'm assuming the Swift animation APIs are going to.

00:37:07
<transcript>: Be good enough. It's more on kotlin in React Native we're having issues with Android.

00:37:09
<transcript>: Mostly with masking.

00:37:09
<transcript>: and animating

00:37:14
neochromer: interesting

00:37:18
<transcript>: And animating mask. I can get it to mask or I can get it to animate I cannot animate a mask and I just need to work with some native low level cotland stuff anyway.

00:37:31
<transcript>: Okay, I'm going to actually go to my screen now make it 30k for a 100% chance at winning a macbook. I have 30k. No, I don't think I want to do that.

00:37:33
<transcript>: 100% chance winning for you.

00:37:35
<transcript>: No.

00:37:39
<transcript>: Now we're going to keep it random.

00:37:47
<transcript>: Okay. I just have to move on. I just have to cut over to the screen. So what do we have here.

00:37:47
<transcript>: kotlin

00:37:48
<transcript>: Kotlin.

00:37:48
<transcript>: kotli

00:37:50
laytanl_: What's this about swift and kotlin?

00:37:51
<transcript>: Kotlin hey 37 minutes look at me.

00:37:51
<transcript>: thirty seven

00:37:53
rvnn: oh wait @thdxr you're dax? on the syntax.fm podcast?

00:37:54
binajmen: Can't wait to see this Kotlin stuff happening... xDD

00:37:54
<transcript>: 37 minutes, and we're into the code.

00:37:56
<transcript>: It's not so bad today.

00:38:04
<transcript>: I still have X yesterday. I think I've gone like an hour, a couple of streams before I've even cut over to my screen, which is not good.

00:38:10
thdxr: @rvnn yes!

00:38:10
stroopwafel26: 37 minutes! maybe it's twitter time now

00:38:12
<transcript>: Okay, nobody talk on YouTube. If you chat with me on YouTube, I will not see it. Probably.

00:38:14
kociqq: 37 minutes ayezeePoggers the productivity

00:38:17
<transcript>: Dofa thank you for that prime sub. Thank you so much.

00:38:17
<transcript>: i

00:38:21
<transcript>: I love seeing prime subs. Prime subs. They just hit different.

00:38:21
<transcript>: because i know you only

00:38:22
rvnn: ah sweet, that was a cool episode!

00:38:23
sk0gen: This is your first time with Kotlin?

00:38:24
<transcript>: Because I know you only got one of them.

00:38:24
<transcript>: you can

00:38:28
<transcript>: You can give your prime slap to one person, and you chose to give it to me.

00:38:32
thdxr: thanks

00:38:39
<transcript>: Scogan. Welcome to my chat. It is my first time with kotlin. Yes, it is, but I'm confident we're going to get going pretty fast because.

00:38:39
<transcript>: chad

00:38:42
<transcript>: Chad gpp is a thing and also.

00:38:44
smilingbig: cool this is going to be fun

00:38:45
oleksii_lisovyi: Actually not Rust. Don't disappoint Prime son  primeagenScience

00:38:47
<transcript>: You people are a thing. And you're going to tell me all kinds of things that I need to know.

00:38:47
<transcript>: i'm looking

00:38:50
<transcript>: I'm looking forward to it. Cool. This is going to be fun.

00:38:50
<transcript>: yeah

00:38:51
<transcript>: Yeah.

00:38:51
<transcript>: okay

00:38:53
<transcript>: Okay.

00:38:54
magerdev: why not just do that with react native!  I suppose it would depend highly on how much android native rendering you would need but the plugin systems are pretty incredible id say

00:38:57
thdxr: Adam isn't gonna be in Neovim

00:39:04
rvnn: i mean that "no" message came back darn quick ;)

00:39:08
thdxr: oh god....I'm gonna have to setup all this aren't I

00:39:10
<transcript>: What's this about? Swift and kotlin layton? We're building the rebase TV app. So rebase TV. You should go sign up because there's a chance in a MacBook. Hey, another chance, people, another chance for you to win a MacBook.

00:39:10
alexkates: React native ftw

00:39:17
smilingbig: thdxr LUL

00:39:20
<transcript>: Rebase is going to be like hq trivia if you know what that is. But for developers. So it's going to be a live trivia show. We're going to do it weekly. And developers.

00:39:20
<transcript>: are going to have

00:39:23
<transcript>: Are going to have like a live thing to join and.

00:39:23
<transcript>: answer develop

00:39:24
<transcript>: Answer developer questions.

00:39:24
<transcript>: it's going to be so

00:39:29
<transcript>: It's going to be so fun. I'm pumped and we got to build the mobile app.

00:39:38
<transcript>: I'm going to have to set all up all this, aren't I? What? No, this isn't. Adam isn't going to be in neo vim. Oh, no.

00:39:45
thdxr: no I meant I'm also gonna have to set this up

00:39:49
<transcript>: Why not just do that with Ragnative? I suppose it would depend highly on how much Android native rendering you would need, but the plugin systems are pretty incredible. I'd say we started with Expo.

00:39:51
vapor__dev: What service came out of a Caribbean island in the late 1990s?

00:39:55
thdxr: for some reason I just realized that

00:39:56
thdxr: LOL

00:39:57
<transcript>: And I just kept running into things. It's like every turn, I felt like I'm too far away from the mobile device. And I'm right.

00:40:09
oleksii_lisovyi: @adamdotdev don't you see my messages or just skip em all cause they're too damn?

00:40:11
stroopwafel26: it's the year of kotlin on the linux desktop

00:40:17
aisebaxp: Rebase is going to have an api to integrate it with others twitch channels ??

00:40:17
<transcript>: So many layers between it that when something doesn't work, how I need it to work. I can't even figure out how to fix it. And there's not a library that'll work for masking on Android or whatever. There's just all these little stupid issues. And I felt like this app is not that big. We're going to build it twice. It's not that big. We're going to build it two.

00:40:17
<transcript>: times

00:40:18
<transcript>: Times.

00:40:30
dofha: I learned some cool stuff about aws/sst on your stream, hence the prime sub

00:40:31
<transcript>: The majority of the app is animations and like, interactivity feeling really good. So I feel like if I have native, I'll have a little more control. I don't know. Maybe that's a dumb thing to do, but that's what we're doing.

00:40:48
binajmen: ICQ?

00:40:51
<transcript>: Don't you see my messages? Or just skip them all because they're too damn, they're too damn. Alexi. Alexi's. Here. Wait. Did I miss your messages? Alexi, what did you say? I'm scrolling. Actually not rust. Don't disappoint Prime.

00:40:51
<transcript>: is that your

00:40:59
<transcript>: Is that your first message? Alexey? Did I miss more? I'm having a hard time with my chat because of the macbook thing. It's so hard.

00:40:59
<transcript>: to

00:41:01
<transcript>: To read messages.

00:41:01
<transcript>: it's

00:41:03
<transcript>: It's a problem for me.

00:41:03
<transcript>: alex

00:41:07
<transcript>: Alexi. Bited. I see another message of yours.

00:41:11
<transcript>: I'm so sorry, alexi. I did not mean to skip your messages.

00:41:11
<transcript>: oh

00:41:15
<transcript>: Oh, rick's, here. The overlay pop up said six bits, I think. Okay, anyway.

00:41:16
fragaverage: Remote it from chat, put it somewhere in overlays

00:41:19
oleksii_lisovyi: It's OK, just wanted to make sure that's not a twitch bug @adamdotdev

00:41:19
<transcript>: I can't keep up with chat anymore.

00:41:19
<transcript>: it's the macbook

00:41:22
tastefulelk: heyoo

00:41:24
magerdev: you may have run into issues with reanimated and its bindings as well.  I ran into a lot of issues with adding customcode because my new code with conflict with an existing dependency

00:41:24
<transcript>: It's the MacBook thing that did us in I wish it didn't actually show me.

00:41:24
<transcript>: okay

00:41:25
vimcerf: day three of Adam being upset with chat for not having a macbook already Sadge

00:41:31
captaincorkes: there is also kotlin multiplatform. anybody use it? is it good?

00:41:40
<transcript>: Okay, maybe I'm not going to do a message when you don't win. That would cut down on a lot of chatter if you don't win the macbook. Maybe I just won't say so. Sebastian is here. What's going on? Sebastian, make sure it's not twitchbook. No, I see you, alexi. I see you now.

00:41:41
rvnn: make it a whisper?

00:41:44
<transcript>: Icq.

00:41:45
fragaverage: @vimcerf truth

00:41:45
pot0fgreeed: yeah, only show a message when you win

00:41:48
<transcript>: You learned some cool stuff about aws, sst. All right.

00:41:48
<transcript>: hence the prime's up

00:41:50
moussx_: whisper is good yeah

00:41:52
<transcript>: Hence the Prime's up I appreciate a lot dofa.

00:41:55
<transcript>: Okay.

00:42:00
<transcript>: Let's do this. Let's set up.

00:42:03
andom: Could it send a whisper on twitch if you dont win?

00:42:05
tastefulelk: Procrastinating work by getting stuck in Orb of Creation. DO NOT PLAY THAT GAME IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP

00:42:07
mono_nz: it the app is really small, don't worry about kotlin multiplatform (even though its pretty awesome). its a bit of a sweat to setup and has some frustrating things.

00:42:10
<transcript>: Kotlin. And this is like, how to get set up for the very beginning, right? This is the first part of getting started with kotlin multiplatformer Mobile. Wait. Do I need to start out with multiplatform.

00:42:19
<transcript>: I guess. Okay to write iOS Civic code and run an iOS application on simulator or real device. You'll need a Mac with macOS.

00:42:28
<transcript>: Okay. So I'm actually going to do the whole iOS, like all the Swift development I'm going to do.

00:42:28
<transcript>: in something

00:42:29
ricardocino: Have my prime sub, didn't know it existed adamdo8DealWithIt

00:42:32
<transcript>: In something that's like a kotlin environment.

00:42:32
<transcript>: ric

00:42:39
<transcript>: Ricardo, thank you so much for my prime sub. I mean, for your prime sub. Well, for giving me your prime sub. I guess it's my prime sub. Now, I guess.

00:42:39
<transcript>: thank

00:42:41
<transcript>: Thank you so much.

00:42:42
fragaverage: repurposed my M1 mini to a 24/7 stream

00:42:47
<transcript>: Have my prime. So I'm didn't. I know it existed. Well, that doesn't make it any less special. I appreciate it.

00:42:51
mono_nz: just go straight to kotlin/compose for android

00:42:53
<transcript>: Repurposed my M one Mini to a 24/7 stream.

00:42:53
<transcript>: what does that

00:42:59
<transcript>: What does that mean? Frag? Is that another message that dax told you to say.

00:43:04
<transcript>: Only show a message when you win I think that'd be best.

00:43:08
<transcript>: Whisper is good. Oh, we could whisper. That's a good idea.

00:43:13
<transcript>: I'm having a hard time seeing chat messages now, and I think I need to make a change.

00:43:13
<transcript>: k do

00:43:17
charafmrah: You don’t have to start with Kotlin Multiplatform. Google has Kotlin docs for Android dev specifically.

00:43:18
thdxr: repurposed my M1 mini to a 24/7 stream

<transcript>: K Doctor works on macos, only to make sure everything works is expected. Install and run K doctor. Okay, so let's do this. Here we go. Oh, this feels like the arch wiki. It's like here's one page here's how to do it all. But there's, like 27 links. I got to click on each link and read it thoroughly.

00:43:29
<transcript>: i already have

00:43:31
<transcript>: I already have Android studio.

00:43:31
<transcript>: look at this

00:43:32
<transcript>: Look at this.

00:43:37
<transcript>: We're already set up. I've already got our Android studio. We're halfway there.

00:43:42
fragaverage: LUL no not a Dax inspired confusing message. I started a 24/7 stream from my M1 mini. It shows AI generated art

00:43:45
<transcript>: Run them on simulator or hardware devices. Xcode. I do believe I have xcode. Let's make sure.

00:43:49
<transcript>: That showed a little icon like it was, are you kidding me.

00:43:49
<transcript>: it

00:43:51
<transcript>: It's shown an icon as if.

00:43:57
<transcript>: It were going to open it in another tab and it didn't just straight opened it in the snab.

00:44:04
<transcript>: Stop. It. Dax. Oh, my goodness. I'm going crazy.

00:44:11
<transcript>: You don't have to start with kotlin multiplatform. Google has kotlin docs for Android dev specifically. Yeah.

00:44:11
<transcript>: am i going to pin

00:44:11
vapor__dev: Let’s get a moment for that beautiful Lara bar placement

00:44:15
<transcript>: Am I going to pin myself into any kind of corner going with this multi platform route.

00:44:20
<transcript>: Anybody you may know am I going to wish I hadn't started this way.

thdxr: The complex houses married and single soldiers and their families

00:44:25
<transcript>: Okay. So it looks like.

00:44:25
<transcript>: xcode

00:44:27
<transcript>: Xcode Ratings Not the best.

00:44:28
bishopdev: swift and ios is pretty easy

00:44:30
<transcript>: Am I surprised? No.

00:44:31
rvnn: that was a smooth video transition

00:44:31
bishopdev: never touched kotlin

00:44:34
<transcript>: We're opening xcode.

00:44:37
smilingbig: I think all ways are jank for reasons personally LUL

00:44:40
binajmen: if you're going twice the job, I suppose it's better to go with Kotlin vanilla

00:44:40
<transcript>: The complex house is married and single soldiers in their families. Oh my word. Dad.

00:44:40
<transcript>: you're

00:44:43
<transcript>: You're just trying to make me go crazy.

00:44:48
<transcript>: The message is the weird messages. I can't handle it people.

00:44:54
smilingbig: so just pick one you prefer and deal with it's jank I guess

00:44:56
<transcript>: Oh, this was a shell script. I wrote. Cool. So this is xcode. I remember it being.

00:44:56
<transcript>: worse

00:44:58
deaconbeacon2: Watching this stream feels like a whole new experience for me

00:44:59
<transcript>: Worse and bigger. Not just this.

00:44:59
<transcript>: but

00:45:01
<transcript>: But maybe.

00:45:07
<transcript>: Why do I remember xcode being a lot worse? Maybe I need to create a project or something.

00:45:11
<transcript>: New project. I bet that would make it look worse.

00:45:14
<transcript>: Okay.

00:45:19
<transcript>: Never touch kotlin me neither.

00:45:26
<transcript>: If you're going, if you're doing twice the job, I suppose it's better to go with cotton, vanilla.

00:45:37
<transcript>: Deacon beacon. Watching this stream feels like a whole new experience for you. Well, welcome to a whole new experience.

00:45:41
thdxr: ask chat gpt what you should do

00:45:42

00:45:53
<transcript>: It looks like I got a message on YouTube. Jetbains. Jetbains makes some good ide, though. Thank you for that message. Buggy.

00:46:14
<transcript>: building

00:46:15
manbravegg: Can confirm. Jetbrains IDE's 10/10

00:46:15
<transcript>: Building.

00:46:18
<transcript>: With no if I want.

00:46:18
<transcript>: to build

00:46:32
<transcript>: cross

00:46:33
<transcript>: Cross platform.

00:46:36

00:46:45
dslegends: morning all and @adamdotdev!

00:46:46
<transcript>: How should I.

00:46:46
<transcript>: get started

00:46:49
<transcript>: Get started I don't know.

00:46:49
<transcript>: good morning

00:46:52
smilingbig: dslegends o/

00:46:54
<transcript>: Good Morning, ds Legends jetbrains ides ten out of ten.

00:47:00
thdxr: woah ChatGPT 4 got faster!

00:47:04
<transcript>: Go straight kotlin with jetpack compose first can add multiplatform later. Just choose libraries accordingly if you want to Port it over later on. Okay.

00:47:10
<transcript>: So straight. Kotlin with Jetpack compose, what is jetpack compose.

00:47:18
vapor__dev: Yeah way faster

00:47:19
<transcript>: Kotlin is the recommended language.

00:47:24
vapor__dev: Why not cross platform ?

00:47:29
<transcript>: Okay.

00:47:32
rvnn: is it because it's the paid version?

00:47:35
<transcript>: This is painful. Just waiting. Set up the development environment. Here we go. Download, install Android Studio check.

00:47:37
mono_nz: jetpack compose is the new declarative UI

00:47:43
<transcript>: Are you guys saying I should use some jetbrains thing? Is that what people are saying? I just can't imagine installing something from jetbrains right now.

00:47:45
mono_nz: its androids version of swiftUI

00:47:47
<transcript>: Why not cross platform? So Alan.

00:47:47
<transcript>: it's just

00:47:52
<transcript>: It's just not a very big app and it's very heavy on.

00:47:54
<transcript>: Interaction.

00:48:00
<transcript>: And animations and stuff. Dark ifou dark. Fu. Thank you for that. Follow.

00:48:08
<transcript>: And I was running into some very early issues getting the cross platform libraries to work on Android.

00:48:08
<transcript>: they worked on ios

00:48:09
mono_nz: android studio is jetbrains =P

00:48:11
charafmrah: Yep vouch for Jetpack compose. Stay away from XML.

00:48:17
thdxr: jetpack compose looks way better wow

00:48:21
<transcript>: They worked on iOS, and then they wouldn't work on Android. And there's no options to change to make it work on iOS or on Android. So then it's like I got to find a new library, and there are no other masking libraries. It's just very frustrating. Okay. I got frustrated.

00:48:21
<transcript>: so instead

00:48:24
<transcript>: So instead we're going to build it twice.

00:48:24
<transcript>: maybe

00:48:27
binajmen: Yes WebStorm from JetBrains is VS code killer. You got the equivalent for Kotlin. I can assume this will be a clear win.

00:48:28
<transcript>: Maybe jetback composes a new declarative UI.

00:48:39
<transcript>: I am using the paid version. It could be that it's because it's the paid version. Arvin.

00:48:41
vapor__dev: Makes sense. Do it twice!! Lfgo

00:48:48
<transcript>: Android's version of Swift ui. Oh man, I've heard of Swift ui, so I haven't done Swift since Swift ui came out.

00:48:51
rvnn: YOu can call me Raven :)

00:48:57
<transcript>: And I'm a little bummed that I might have to learn what Swift UI is. I've only done Swift. I've never done Swift UI.

00:49:00
<transcript>: Raven. That's easier to say I'll call you Raven.

00:49:05
<transcript>: Android Studio is JETBRAINS. Oh, that is JETBRAINS.

00:49:08
rvnn: But I appreciate not being called Run

00:49:18
<transcript>: Okay, then I guess I've already installed a jetbrains thing. Where is it? Here we are. Jetbrains. So this is made by jetbrains. Isn't that like a third party? They make the official Android studio.

00:49:34
<transcript>: Jetpack compose. Stay away from xml. Okay, you got it. We're doing it. Webstorm from jetbrains is vs. Code killer. You got the equivalent for kotlin. I can assume this will be a clear win. Okay.

00:49:36
<transcript>: All right.

00:49:37
captaincorkes: they collaborate with google

00:49:41
oleksii_lisovyi: @rvnn "Say my name" (c) LOL

00:49:45
<transcript>: Not calling you run. I will not call you run. Raven. It is. They collaborate with Google. Okay, so jetpack, compose.

00:49:49
<transcript>: How do I get started.

00:49:49
<transcript>: with

00:49:52
<transcript>: With jetpack compose.

00:49:52
<transcript>: or is that

00:49:55
<transcript>: Or is that a language? Is it a tool.

00:50:04
<transcript>: What is it? A modern ui toolkit for Android that simplifies and accelerates.

00:50:04
<transcript>: it's so

00:50:05
wietlol: iirc, Android Studio is from Google, but it is a fork from IntelliJ (from Jetbrains), but my understanding here might be wrong...

00:50:06
<transcript>: It's so slow.

00:50:06
<transcript>: thank

00:50:07
rvnn: you're testing me know @oleksii_lisovyi :)

00:50:12
rvnn: *now*

00:50:18
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow it's, tonyan, if I recall Android Studios from Google, but it is a fork from intellij from jetbrains. My understanding here might be wrong. Welcome to Chat we Atlal.

00:50:28
<transcript>: This is too much.

00:50:36
<transcript>: Kotlin Multiplam flat, multi platform mobile plugin that's hard to say. Kotlin multiplatform mobile plugin.

00:50:50
<transcript>: An Android Studio Select Settings Preferences Plugin Search Marketplace for kotlin multiplatform Mobile and then the column plugin is bundled with ej Android Studio Release. However, it still needs to be updated to the latest version to avoid compatibility issues. Updates Plugin okay.

00:50:50
<transcript>: so

00:50:57
<transcript>: So I think I'm good I think I already have Android studio so let's just get started.

00:50:57
<transcript>: let's just build

00:51:01
<transcript>: Let's just build something. Maybe. Is there, like a sample app I should start with.

00:51:06
<transcript>: Open, Andrew. Okay, let's do it. Android studio.

00:51:12
<transcript>: Create new project new project here we go.

00:51:13

00:51:35
<transcript>: They said. Empty compose Activity configure Project Settings understand the Basics composables are reusable, self contained ui elements that can be combined to create complex uis. Understand. Modifiers used to apply styling, layout, and behavior to composables.

00:51:35

00:51:52
<transcript>: Whatever that was.

00:51:53
rvnn: Latency To Broadcaster: 3.34 seconds. I've never been so close to a live stream here from Aus!

00:52:02
<transcript>: I heard it. I don't know what that was. I think it was a resub and it's going to come in later. I think I hear the noise first, and then I see the activity later.

00:52:22
<transcript>: Latency to broadcaster. 3.3 seconds. Never been so close to the live stream here from Australia. Well, how about that? I don't know what I did in that equation. It's probably mostly Twitch and ibs and Amazon. But you know what? You're welcome. I am not in Australia. I'm in the ozarks buggy worm. Thank you for the follow.

00:52:36
<transcript>: Buggy worm. Hey, anybody else by chance? Live in the ozarks. Want to come to Coffee with me and Jordan and maliro? We're going to coffee at 10:00, the end of this stream. Pretty pumped.

00:55:32
<transcript>: Okay.

00:55:33
<transcript>: This feels fine.

00:55:33
<transcript>: we'll just do

00:55:37
<transcript>: We'll just do eleven oh, 48% of devices.

00:55:37
<transcript>: that doesn't seem

00:55:38
thdxr: Adam I talked to Ryan Hoover about rebase and he said "this sounds challenging for us to invest in" so there's that

00:55:40
<transcript>: That doesn't seem 68%.

00:55:40
<transcript>: eighty

00:55:46
<transcript>: 81%. I feel like we should do more than that. I do like Oreos.

00:55:46
<transcript>: ninety

00:55:47
<transcript>: 90%.

00:55:47
<transcript>: nuget would

00:55:50
<transcript>: Nuget would be 92.

00:55:52
<transcript>: 94%.

00:55:55
deaconbeacon2: Sayin 10 cuz my phone have android 10

00:55:58
buggyworm: minimumSDK should depend on your user base (ideally)

00:56:07
<transcript>: Adam, I talked to Ryan hoover, Ryan hoover about rebase. And he said, oh, product Hunt. This sounds challenging us for us to invest in. So there's that.

00:56:12
<transcript>: You asked Ryan if they could invest in rebate.

00:56:18
<transcript>: I actually kind of know Ryan. I don't really know Ryan, but.

00:56:18

00:56:20
<transcript>: Hokeip, thank you for the follow.

00:56:20
<transcript>: i don't

00:56:28
<transcript>: I don't know, Ryan, but he did discover us when Sat me's launched and he asked us to put something on product on. That was earlier days, eight years ago on product Hunt.

00:56:28
<transcript>: and

00:56:33
<transcript>: And I remember it was cool to see him so excited about it.

00:56:33
<transcript>: same

00:56:41
stroopwafel26: The horrible state of Android when Android 7 is still out there

00:56:45
<transcript>: Same tin because my phone have Android Ten. Okay, ten. It is. Well, no. Then we're cutting so many people out. Should depend on your user base. Ideally, I guess we have a tech friendly, crowd.

00:56:54
<transcript>: We have a tech friendly crowd, so maybe we can go with ten. It's only 68% of devices. Just seems so low.

00:57:00
mono_nz: 24+ should be ok. else they are dam old phones that you prob dont want anyway :P

00:57:01
<transcript>: But like, I don't know, developers. Maybe they're going to be running the latest and greatest. Maybe.

00:57:04
thdxr: Adam Android devices are crazy long tail

00:57:04
overra_dev: there are billions of devices

00:57:08
<transcript>: Okay. Let's go into rebase, and I guess I'm going to make a package for this new folder.

00:57:08
thdxr: because international

00:57:11
<transcript>: Kotlin.

00:57:12
thdxr: I'd do like 12 tbh

00:57:14
<transcript>: Or app. Two.

00:57:15
thdxr: maybe 11

00:57:16
aivarsmeijers: Latest and greates is my aproach for any new iOS app

<transcript>: Go that to for now.

00:57:20
earholesmcgee: oooooh didnt know you were into mobile development

00:57:26
<transcript>: I do like twelve, to be honest. Maybe eleven. Okay.

00:57:30
<transcript>: Let's do 1140. 8% advises.

00:57:30
<transcript>: okay

00:57:31
<transcript>: Okay.

00:57:31
<transcript>: there are billions

00:57:33
<transcript>: There are billions of devices.

00:57:34
buggyworm: In places like India (generally Asia) there are like a lot of older devices active like mine (Kit Kat)

00:57:38
<transcript>: Of their crazy long tail gotcha so the statistics are a little skewed.

00:57:38
<transcript>: twenty

00:57:44
<transcript>: 24 plus should be okay elsewhere. Damn old phones that you probably don't want anyway. Okay.

00:57:52
<transcript>: Latest and greatest is my approach for any new iOS app. Didn't know you were in a mobile development, you know ear hole. I'm not.

00:58:00
<transcript>: But we're gonna do some mobile development today. I've done a little bit. I've mostly done stuff in Swift. Never done anything with kotlin.

00:58:06
<transcript>: Buggy worm you're on Kitcat.

00:58:06
<transcript>: i don't even

00:58:11
<transcript>: I don't even see Kit kat. How old is kitkat? That would be before L. Jk. L. Wow.

00:58:11
aisebaxp: Is there anywhere where you can find the cuota for each device by country, region so it can be more accurate?

00:58:18
<transcript>: I just don't know anything about Android. So this is all very fascinating. Is there anywhere where you can find.

00:58:18
<transcript>: the

00:58:23
<transcript>: The qoda for each device by country, region, so it could be more accurate.

00:58:23
<transcript>: i don't know

00:58:24
rvnn: if it's a simple app and you're not going to use any feature introduced in the latest versions, then go back as far as you can. IMO

00:58:28
mecoupz: adam started on yt, soon on kick? XD

00:58:29
<transcript>: I don't know. Okay. We're going to do it. We're going to create it. I hit the button.

00:58:31
<transcript>: What do we have here.

00:58:38
<transcript>: Go to file. Oh, it feels so bad to not be in neo vim. I'm going to be honest. This is going to be tough.

00:58:41
<transcript>: This is going to be tough.

00:58:44
earholesmcgee: Any reason not using React native?

00:58:44
<transcript>: Okay.

00:58:50
<transcript>: Now I just got next. Why you were like, I'm going to have to set up this, aren't I.

00:58:55
mono_nz: you can change it later in build gradle file anyway

00:58:59
<transcript>: Funny. Whoa, oh, it's still doing stuff. Oh, it's still doing stuff. Wow, it's so slow.

00:59:03
thdxr: you can turn on vim bindings for Android studio

00:59:06
binajmen: maybe they got a neovim plugin to keep your hands on your keyboard?

00:59:06
<transcript>: What is happening now? I know I say new of him as fast because this is unbelievable. Still Loading. Loading. What.

00:59:10
vimcerf: the blazing speed of this m2

00:59:11
<transcript>: You can turn on vim bindings for Android Studio. That'd be nice, I guess.

00:59:12
shebster: its indexing

00:59:17
<transcript>: Adam started on YouTube soon. On kick. No, probably not on Kick. Just YouTube.

00:59:22
itsmeleague: You cannot rush greatness duh

00:59:23
<transcript>: Youtube and twitch Beansmate thank you so much for the follow.

00:59:25
im_noxz: it has to install kotlin and the sdks

00:59:27
stroopwafel26: indexing a new almost empty project? lol

00:59:29
<transcript>: It's indexing you cannot rush greatness.

00:59:33
wietlol: indexing SDK

00:59:34
<transcript>: Has to install kotlin in the sdks. Okay, fine.

00:59:38
<transcript>: I'll wait like a caveman. I'll just sit here and do nothing.

00:59:39
wietlol: installing gradle

00:59:41
<transcript>: I guess I could just be talking to you people.

00:59:41
<transcript>: while

00:59:42
captaincorkes: IdeaVim plugin is not installed by default right?

00:59:47
shebster: sdk is really huge

00:59:48
<transcript>: While this is doing this, okay. It's doing a bunch of dumb stuff. So let's talk about something I don't know.

00:59:48
fragaverage: Like you need an excuse to get lost in chat

00:59:51
smilingbig: you people Sadge

00:59:52
<transcript>: Do you want to get on Twitter? Maybe we'll get on Twitter.

00:59:52
<transcript>: like i

00:59:54
<transcript>: Like I need an excuse to get lost.

00:59:58
<transcript>: I got something.

00:59:58
handyfuuf: !roulette all

01:00:00
buggyworm: All Java based IDE's are slow all the way.

01:00:04
smilingbig: we need a you people counter I think LUL

01:00:06
<transcript>: I do say you people a lot, don't I I got to stop with the you people unless you guys like it. Do you guys like it.

01:00:09
<transcript>: Do you like when I say you people.

01:00:10
stroopwafel26: YOU ADAM

01:00:13
vimcerf: you people of the twitches

01:00:15
thdxr: I like you people

01:00:15
<transcript>: Is it nice? Is it endearing? Is this starting to grow on you? You. Adam.

01:00:15
<transcript>: so

01:00:17
oleksii_lisovyi: @adamdotdev nobody cares ;)

01:00:20
earholesmcgee: What do you mean when you say "You people"?

01:00:24
thdxr: I call my audience "you dummies" so what's better

01:00:25
<transcript>: So I got something yesterday. You liked you people. Okay. Thanks, zacks. Are you just saying that because you think I'm going to get canceled? No one cares. Says alexi. Nobody cares.

01:00:28
<transcript>: When I say, you people, I just mean you people.

01:00:30
aisebaxp: You can call us you minions

01:00:31
<transcript>: All of you people.

01:00:32
stroopwafel26: @thdxr thanks i like you too

01:00:33
charafmrah: Damn a sick transition even for rants

01:00:35
smilingbig: KEKW

01:00:35
phdhorrible: It’s “we the people”

01:00:37
<transcript>: You call them dummies? Well, then, I am better. I'm better for calling them people.

01:00:40
overra_dev: i am a people

01:00:41
daneoshiga: a lot of streamers just say "chat"

01:00:42
earholesmcgee: Us people

01:00:45
buggyworm: Call em nerds

01:00:45
<transcript>: Minions. So it's still doing stuff over here. It's still indexing or something. Yesterday. Somebody tweeted a thing about a stack.

01:00:45
<transcript>: that

01:00:47
<transcript>: That.

01:00:47
<transcript>: is like

01:00:49
earholesmcgee: DOT PEOPLE

01:00:49
bishopdev: you're from the midwest .. it would go against your nature not saying 'YOU PEOPLE'

01:00:50
<transcript>: Is like the best stack or something. Was the tweet. I don't remember.

01:00:50
<transcript>: but

01:00:54
<transcript>: But it was like just this list of sas apps.

01:00:54
<transcript>: and

01:00:57
smilingbig: chadstack?

01:00:58
fragaverage: I remember this tweet

01:00:58
<transcript>: And it occurred to me that I see this a lot.

01:00:58
<transcript>: like

01:01:01
<transcript>: Like prominent people on Twitter.

01:01:01
<transcript>: saying like

01:01:07
cowfacedev: how did kotlin and swift make appearance? LUL

01:01:08
oleksii_lisovyi: Sound sassy

01:01:13
<transcript>: Saying, like, stitch together all of these things, and you can go so fast. But I've never seen an actual startup with a real product using all those things. Never once. I just haven't.

01:01:13
<transcript>: and some people point

01:01:26
<transcript>: And some people pointed out in replies on Twitter. Here's a couple of companies, but there's two, and they've listed those two somebody trying to save or sell. But versailles built on aws, come on.

01:01:26
<transcript>: and cloudflare

01:01:29
<transcript>: And cloudflare, I guess, but.

01:01:29
<transcript>: they're not like built

01:01:34
fragaverage: 99% of startups aren't building in public though, you wont know most of their stack

01:01:35
<transcript>: They're not like built on whatever. They're not built on versailles, because they are versailles. So many of these apps that.

01:01:40
<transcript>: People build on Twitter are using a stack that I just don't think.

01:01:40
<transcript>: like any

01:01:43
mecoupz: real talk. if you build something, your customers dont give anything about your stack

01:01:47
earholesmcgee: In my opinion theyre really good to get up a POC if you wanna go the VC route. However it doesnt seem is scalable

01:01:47
<transcript>: Like any real startup uses. And so that got me thinking about a lot of things you got back in Twitter all riled up.

01:01:47
<transcript>: all two dozen of

01:01:50
<transcript>: All two dozen of us.

01:02:01
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't know. I think I'm a big fan of serverless. I'm a big fan of doing as little as possible and focusing on your thing. But I also feel like.

01:02:01
<transcript>: if

01:02:05
thdxr: there's no CTOs on Twitter

01:02:15
<transcript>: If you're like stacking a list of like five or six series a startups to make up your software, stack the amount of risk there, like if you're actually building something that you plan to build on for years, or even raise money.

01:02:34
neochromer: I have not against Theo, but Theo does that a lot recommending tools for everything

01:02:35
<transcript>: You're now not only dependent on your own success, but you're dependent on, like four or five other startups that make no code tools for them to succeed so that you don't get swept out from underneath you like your whole stack just crumbles because, oh, now I can't use bubble or whatever for my event aggregations. I got to build something myself. I just feel so brittle and so.

01:02:40
neochromer: and also some instable / beta tools

01:02:47
<transcript>: In vogue. And it makes me mad. I don't know. Makes me mad, that's all. Not mad. Mad's the wrong word. It just makes me like, feel like there's a huge disconnect between Twitter.

01:02:47
<transcript>: and the real

01:02:48
buggyworm: People are so obsessed over productivity it actually makes them unproductive.

01:02:49
thdxr: but plz bet on SST and unproven startup

01:02:51
<transcript>: And the real world. I guess everyone knew that that's not revelatory.

01:03:01
<transcript>: Well, okay, this isn't much of a rant. It's just me externally processing, mostly things I already said on Twitter.

01:03:01
<transcript>: i am

01:03:02
thdxr: an

01:03:03
smilingbig: you should have reacted to the tweet with the image thdxr took of you yesterday LUL

01:03:05
<transcript>: I am a people. Ovara is a people. It's we the people, okay.

01:03:05
mecoupz: that chat on screen is new right?

01:03:16
<transcript>: A lot of streamers just say chat. Yeah, I don't know. Just saying chat seems so impersonal. It just says, like humans aren't chat. They're people. So you people.

01:03:17
<transcript>: i'm just going

01:03:19
<transcript>: I'm just going to call you you people.

01:03:21
<transcript>: Okay.

01:03:24
buggyworm: Not a RANT but PHILOSHPHY

01:03:31
<transcript>: Some of you will like it, and you'll stick around. Some of you won't, and I'm willing to accept that I'm willing to take that loss that some of you you're not going to like it. Some of you people are not going to like it.

01:03:31
<transcript>: colum

01:03:36
<transcript>: Column. Nerds. That's theo's thing, isn't it? He calls everybody nerds.

01:03:41
bishopdev: there's not a disconnect between twitter and real world, it's a separate group

01:03:42
neochromer: I will never leave <3

01:03:42
<transcript>: I call some people nerds, but usually I use nerds in kind of a derogatory way, even though nerds are cool.

01:03:44
aisebaxp: For your company you have a platform team that develops programing tools for you? Or you use whats available out there?

01:03:46
rvnn: I thought I was the product :)

01:03:48
overra_dev: not southern enough for yall?

01:03:54
<transcript>: It's just like when somebody gets too upset about something like, I do like, nerd. Get over it. You're from the midwest. It would go against your nature, not saying you people. It would. Is that a midwest thing I didn't even know.

01:03:56
buggyworm: :s/PHILOSHPHY/PHILOSOPHY

01:03:59
<transcript>: How did Colin and Swift make appearance.

01:04:02
stroopwafel26: nerds are the best *pushes glasses up nose*

01:04:08
oleksii_lisovyi: We're twitch personas here, not actual a human. Just accept it @adamdotdev ;p

01:04:13
<transcript>: Kyz is here. Hakal face. You didn't win. I redeemed your two things and you did not win today. Tomorrow you got one more and we'll find out kotlin and Swift. We're going to be building a mobile app today. Calfbase right now.

01:04:13
<transcript>: kotli

01:04:15
<transcript>: Kotlin is indexing.

01:04:18
fragaverage: You did @cowFaceDev, he's a SCAMMER

01:04:29
bishopdev: 'how YOU people doing?"

01:04:29
manbravegg: I love being called a nerd. I take it as a compliment.

01:04:35
<transcript>: Or something? I don't know. It's still doing stuff. What is it doing? Who knows? It's doing stuff. 90% 99% of startups aren't building in public, though. You won't know most of their stack. That's true. So it's just the people, the indie hackers that build in public, that tout these stacks that feel like a house of cards.

01:04:41
dinisskizee: ez win't

01:04:43
dinisskizee: Hey :)

01:04:48
<transcript>: Real talk. If you build something, your customers don't give anything about your stack. It's true they don't. But you're going to care six months in about your stack. And I think a lot of people are just doing stuff. That's not a good idea.

01:04:51
<transcript>: In my opinion they're really good to get.

01:04:51
<transcript>: up a proof

01:05:00
<transcript>: Up a proof of concept. If you want to go the vc route, however, it doesn't seem scalable. So here's my thing. Your holes. And this is the thing I thought of on Twitter that I meant to say on Twitter.

01:05:09
<transcript>: That's true if you can go so much faster using those tools than just spending the time to learn something else. Learn laravel, learn rail.

01:05:09
<transcript>: rails learn

01:05:18
<transcript>: Rails learn some aws stuff and you'll be able to build things repeatedly, repeatedly and you won't have to spend a ton of time.

01:05:18
<transcript>: building

01:05:30
oleksii_lisovyi: PHP, LET'S GO!

01:05:38
<transcript>: Building proof of concept. It only makes sense to cobble together all these other services if you can go way faster and I just don't think you can. I think somebody who really knows what they're doing with other tools and has spent the time to learn them can move just as fast and have something that they don't have to rewrite. I just hate that mentality of like, we'll just rewrite it if it works.

01:05:38
<transcript>: if people

01:05:50
<transcript>: If people actually use this thing, if it takes off, we have a real business. We'll rewrite it. Well, that's going to suck when you have a real business and you're not serving your users because you're rewriting the whole thing. You know what I'm saying? Okay, I'm done.

01:05:54
<transcript>: There's no ctos on Twitter.

01:05:54
<transcript>: that's true

01:05:55
<transcript>: That's true.

01:05:59
earholesmcgee: I think the people useing the frank-stack isn't looking to learn. Theyre looking to build and make money.

01:06:02
2dorkstv: morning, party people!

01:06:12
<transcript>: I have nothing against theo, but theo does that a lot. Recommending tools for everything. Also, some instable beta tools. I know you talked about bleeding responsibly, so it's at least on theo's mind. I think people are so obsessed over productivity, it actually makes them unproductive.

01:06:29
zappy_idk: o/

01:06:32
<transcript>: Yeah, that's the thing too. That's a whole nother thing. Two X cho thank you for the follow. Did I say that right. Two times. Show chow please bet on sst and unproven startup. No, sst is not unproven. You guys actually have revenue. I feel like a lot of these vcs are a lot.

01:06:32
<transcript>: of these

01:06:35
zappy_idk: New mobile app :0

01:06:41
<transcript>: Of these startups that people are depending on in their stacks are still living off vc dollars and hoping they build a business. You guys are sustainable.

01:06:50
<transcript>: Sst is a great option. You should have reached to the Tweet with the image dax took of you yesterday. I should have reacted to the.

01:07:07
<transcript>: Image. That was a good one. I'm going to never make a face again. That chat on screen is new. It is me, coops. I was trying to put chat in for the vods. I wanted it to be in the vods. Otherwise, you watch these. And it's just me talking to myself. And it's like, I don't know, loses something, right.

01:07:07
<transcript>: not

01:07:12
<transcript>: Not a rant, but philosophy. There you go. This is just philosophy.

01:07:16
puccababy: yeah truth. Inherited a prototype Reach app that is all MUI. I'm spending my time bending that to my will... but I could write the Sass/JS for this in my sleep from scratch. But then unskilled FE dev managed to create the demo in a week so *shrug*

01:07:23
puccababy: React*

01:07:23
<transcript>: Not a disconnect between Twitter and real world. It's a separate group. Oh, just a separate group of people. Okay, that makes sense. So those people that tap those things are that way in real life, too.

01:07:23
lightmeup12: shocked at the dev quality in a lot of startups, exceptions are startups with postdoc founders / team

01:07:26
mecoupz: chat looks good 👍

01:07:27
<transcript>: They're the ones that are on Twitter and very loud.

01:07:27

01:07:33
itsmeleague: Whats the odds for the macbook redeem?

01:07:35
<transcript>: Neocrumber will never leave. Thank you so much, Neochromer. No matter what I call you, you won't leave. Even if I call you a dummy like DAX.

01:07:35
<transcript>: ai seva

01:07:37
10x_developer: Gm I am 10x dev at ur service

01:07:42
manbravegg: Unfortunately that is how it goes. Venture capitalists want a proof of concept before investing. So you often get stuck taking that re-write route if you want any funding for your startup.

01:07:43
<transcript>: Ai seva for your company, you have a platform team that develops programming tools for you, or you use what's available out there for stat news.

01:07:50
<transcript>: Status is four engineers, so we have no platform team.

01:07:52
<transcript>: We do all of us do everything.

01:07:53
neochromer: we are all dummies from time to times :D

01:07:56
thdxr: the weird thing with the "glue 10 services together" stack is they don't even use IaC

01:07:59
<transcript>: Let's see. Raven. I thought I was the product. You thought you were the product.

01:08:04
thdxr: so their stuff is even more janky

01:08:06
mono_nz: mobile dev is great for streaming, lots of time to chat while compiling =P full rebuilds can take a while

01:08:07
<transcript>: Philosophy. Replace philosophy with philosophy.

01:08:07
<transcript>: oh i see

01:08:09
<transcript>: Oh, I see how to typo.

01:08:11
mecoupz: i thought its dax, dax2, dax3 and adam :D

01:08:12
thdxr: making everything talk to each other

01:08:13
neochromer: @adamdotdev do you plan to hire remotely for Statmuse? like serious question :D

01:08:20
<transcript>: I've got a lot of, like, I think it's allergies maybe I've got a lot of, like, sinus something. It's making it hard to breathe at times.

01:08:20
<transcript>: and then i take

01:08:27
<transcript>: And then I take a drink and I really can't breathe nerds are the best pushes glassed up nose where twitch personas here.

01:08:27
<transcript>: not actually

01:08:40
zappy_idk: Did you consider using React Native, or just exploring Kotlin and Swift?

01:08:42
<transcript>: Not actually a human. Just accept it. You guys are just words on a screen. Wouldn't that be funny? Talk about a simulation. What if twitch Chat was all just fake? Like what if it was just a bunch of bots that all had unique personalities. But they're all just bots.

01:08:42
bishopdev: @adamdotdev if you say stupid stuff in RL there's a chance you get punched in the face, twitter doesn't carry the risk so everyone can be an asshole at will

01:08:48
dinisskizee: I'm actually AI

01:08:53
2dorkstv: maybe I'm fake 0_o

01:08:55
dinisskizee: undeveloped AI

01:08:56
<transcript>: And it's just like, people. Oh, man, that makes us all feel so funny. Like, what if I wear this to you? Talking to myself? It's kind of depressing. Kind of starts making me feel like the truman Show or.

01:08:57
fragaverage: @thdxr he's getting too close to the truth, where's his reset button?

01:08:59
<transcript>: You're an actual crazy person.

01:09:02
charafmrah: Twitch chat is just different instances of ChatGPT

01:09:03
manbravegg: Amazon should do that. They might actually make twitch profitable if they did that.

01:09:07
daneoshiga: you're getting too close to the truth, you'll be taken down

01:09:12
overra_dev: a bot wouldn't ask about the larabar

01:09:12
<transcript>: You did cafe sees a scammer. I'm not a scammer. Everyone with the scamming and the cringing and the you guys are just trying to put bad stuff on my name. I can't talk today.

01:09:12
<transcript>: there's been a few times

01:09:20
<transcript>: There's been a few times where I'm just, like, I can't literally think of a single word that's going to come out. How you people doing.

01:09:23
<transcript>: Oh, man, I'm behind again.

01:09:23
<transcript>: we're all dummies

01:09:27
<transcript>: We're all dummies from time time so true. Unfortunately, that's how it goes.

01:09:43
<transcript>: Venture capitalists won a proof of concept before investing. So you often get stuck taking that rewrite route if you want any funding for your startup and another thing, venture capitalists suck. I don't like them. Sorry, I shouldn't say that because I may someday want to raise for something. And I wish I hadn't said that.

01:09:43

mecoupz: should i play the macbook game too? if i win, i could do a giveaway for everyone who follows me on twitter and twitch to get a bigger audience and adam would pay for it XD

01:10:13

01:10:30
<transcript>: New mobile app. That's right. We're building mobile app today. Probably. I think kotlin's actually done now. Or Android Studio Studios actually done. I think says Android Studio performance could be improved, increasing the maximum peep size. I don't know what that means. Sounds like them. Problem, not a me problem.

01:10:40

01:11:43
<transcript>: Aws stocks all the time, but they're not that bad. They're coherent. They're pretty consistent. I don't know. Maybe they're not consistent, but there's enough stuff out there to learn. Aws is not like this major undertaking, and I don't understand why people would rather choose to learn, like six to eight different saas services and their apis and how you do auth and how you whatever. They'd rather.

01:11:43
<transcript>: do all that

01:11:49
earholesmcgee: Why learn AWS when you can use Railway?

01:11:50
<transcript>: Do all that than just spend the time to learn a stack that you can use to build anything anytime you want. I don't know. I'm done.

01:11:50
<transcript>: i keep saying

01:11:57
10x_developer: Bots are people too

01:11:58

01:12:43
<transcript>: If you say stupid stuff in real life, there's a chance you get punched in the face. Twitter doesn't carry the wrist. So everyone could be an asshole. That makes sense. That makes sense. And I think that's broadly, the Internet, not just Twitter. It's worse on reddit, isn't it.

01:16:25
<transcript>: What.

01:16:25
<transcript>: the sub

01:16:37
<transcript>: The sub was maybe. How do you come up with projects that you become passionate about? I want to build something that something is always already created. It doesn't matter if it's already created. This is something my wife tells me all the time. She says that I'm allergic to anything that's already been done.

01:16:38
itsmeleague: Send some emotes mom!

01:16:47
joostschuur: HypePopcorn

01:16:50
<transcript>: But it's not true. It's just I get discouraged. I'm like it's already out there, like, whatever not worth doing. But it actually is a good sign. If it already exists, that means people wanted it. So it's not a bad thing to build something that already exists.

01:16:50

01:21:51
mandude123: No vim plugin?

01:21:57
<transcript>: To launch a virtual device, use a device manager. Oh, it's doing it.

01:22:01
thdxr: you can use neovim once you get going

01:22:01
<transcript>: Oh, that's the.

01:22:04
<transcript>: It's still got some of that.

01:22:06
charafmrah: Yes you can

01:22:09
fryday444: I think you can run it from cli too but I'm not positive.

01:22:11
<transcript>: Project configuration files can be added to git. Don't ask again.

<transcript>: I did not succeed in reading your whole name.

01:23:36
<transcript>: I'm joking. Our family gets rolling. Great mom in laws and all, but I know quite a few people who don't have that good relationship. And it would be a horror show to have mom in law move next door. Yeah. If you don't have a good relationship with your parents, then that would be tough if they live next door.

01:23:36
<transcript>: i could see

01:23:39

01:25:44
rvnn: It needs HMR :)

01:25:51
<transcript>: Did that do it? I don't know. Those key. I don't actually know what the symbols mean. So I just smash keys. I know there's an E involved.

01:25:53
<transcript>: Oh, I figured it out.

01:25:56
vapor__dev: What up overra

01:25:58
<transcript>: It did not update. I don't know if I saved the file.

<transcript>: File.

01:26:10
shebster: It autosaves

01:26:12
<transcript>: Save all is yeah, that's the one I hit.

<transcript>: Kotlin let's see.

01:27:57
<transcript>: Aws IBS kotlin.

01:28:01
<transcript>: So far this is not been terrible, but.

01:28:11
<transcript>: I wonder if it's not been terrible, because I haven't tried to deploy this when we try to build this app. Is it going to be such a nightmare to deal with two separate, like a bit Expo is really nice in that scenario.

01:28:15
<transcript>: Let's see, streaming.

01:28:15
<transcript>: ivs

01:28:19
<transcript>: Ivs already doing that known issues.

01:28:24
<transcript>: Here we go.

01:28:27
<transcript>: This is what I want. The Broadcast guide.

01:28:33
<transcript>: Latest version of Android Broadcast sdk install the library. Here we go.

01:28:35
<transcript>: Maven.

01:28:35
<transcript>: to add the obvious

01:28:42
<transcript>: To add the obvious Android brackets library to Android development environment and the library modules. Build gradle file okay.

01:28:43
<transcript>: That's it.

01:28:43
<transcript>: let's see

01:28:45
<transcript>: Let's see if I can find that.

01:28:50
<transcript>: Build Gradle, Build, gradle.

01:29:03
<transcript>: Module.

01:29:03
<transcript>: okay

01:29:05
<transcript>: Okay. So I do it in this one.

01:29:11
orlinthemage: yes

01:29:13
<transcript>: And this was under dependencies. So we have repositories.

01:29:13
<transcript>: and

01:29:14
rvnn: so confusing NotLikeThis

01:29:15
<transcript>: And dependencies.

01:29:20
<transcript>: I don't see? Oh, here we go? Dependencies? Here we go? Here we go.

01:29:25
<transcript>: I'm going to miss them.

01:29:25
<transcript>: badly

01:29:26
<transcript>: Badly.

01:29:26
<transcript>: implement

01:29:31
<transcript>: Implementation that thing. But then I need to add a repository. I guess.

01:29:36
<transcript>: Maven central do I need to do that.

01:29:36
<transcript>: anybody

01:29:38
<transcript>: Anybody know.

01:29:38
<transcript>: so

01:29:40
shebster: do not forget to sync

01:29:41
phdhorrible: IdeaVIM is really nice

01:29:43
<transcript>: So confusing. Do I need to add the repositories.

01:29:44
mecoupz: its coffee time you people

01:29:45
kedemel: There might be as VIM extension.

01:29:48
fryday444: @adamdotdev You can use a vim plugin which helps

01:29:51
<transcript>: Anybody know do not forget to sink. Oh, boy, it's coffee time.

01:29:51
<transcript>: you can

01:29:53
<transcript>: You can use a vim plugin, which helps.

01:30:01
<transcript>: That would help sync now I feel like I don't know if I need to add.

01:30:01
<transcript>: this repos

01:30:04
<transcript>: This repositories thing.

01:30:07
shebster: mavenCentral is already there

01:30:07
mattmancodes: haha Java dependency management makes npm look halfway normal

01:30:09
tayloreddev: Did you ditch expo?

01:30:10
<transcript>: Can someone tell me if this is needed? I'm just going to do it. Maven. Central. What is that.

01:30:10
<transcript>: use a vim

01:30:11
aisebaxp: Would be fun to have a icon pop up when you mom enters the channel

01:30:12
orlinthemage: yes

01:30:15
charafmrah: You can use vim keybindings using IdeaVim plugin

01:30:16
<transcript>: Use a vim plugin. Maven. Citro is already there. Oh, it is. Okay. So we're going to remove that.

01:30:16
<transcript>: okay

01:30:20
livemahs: Good Morning!

01:30:22
<transcript>: Okay. So I just did this. And that's all. Where was maven Central? Where did I miss that.

01:30:24
lesabotsy: Still a noob so excuse my question but is there really no way to do all this with neovim?

01:30:36
<transcript>: Would be fun to have an icon pop up when my mom enters the channel. That sounds fun. Build some mom specific. Did I need to save this? Save.

01:30:39
<transcript>: Sync, now.

01:30:39
<transcript>: we're going to

01:30:40
mattmancodes: @Lesabotsy you can do it in nvim

01:30:48
<transcript>: We're going to sync the ivs broadcast thing. Oh, no, it's not broadcast. No, I don't want broadcast. I want viewing.

01:30:48
<transcript>: android

01:30:51

01:31:03
<transcript>: I think I can fix it.

01:31:10
<transcript>: I want to hit my vim command so bad.

01:31:13
<transcript>: Now let's sync it again.

01:31:15
lesabotsy: @mattmancodes even the emulation part?

01:31:21
<transcript>: Still noobs excuse my question, but is there really no way to do all this with neo Vim? I bet I could edit all the text with neo vim.

01:31:25
<transcript>: I could edit all the text. Let's just do this.

01:31:32
<transcript>: It's this one. Let's do this.

01:31:38
<transcript>: No.

01:31:44
<transcript>: Rebase TV push the code.

01:31:44

01:32:13
thdxr: should I come?

01:32:17
<transcript>: Would you like to install a language server? Oh, sure.

01:32:20

01:32:37
<transcript>: Was it even the emulation part? What did I miss? Duh duh du du DA DA DA DA? Is coffee still on today? Yes, maliro. I wasn't able to find someone to watch my baby. So I'd have to bring him. Bring your baby, bring your baby. Babies are welcome.

<transcript>: Look at the nesting.

01:36:22

laytanl_: :TSInstall kotlin

01:38:56
laytanl_: Pla

01:38:58

01:39:29
<transcript>: I should make my mom a vip. Thank you so much, sussey. Also, welcome to chat and also Sin. Hello. Welcome to Chat. Let's make mom a vip. She's the very Vipist of them all. Let's see here. Vip, make vip. I would make her a mod, but she would not know what to do with that. How do I make.

01:39:29
<transcript>: her a vip

01:39:29
sehn0: love to see kotlin dev !

puccababy: only decaf after 5pm or ZERO sleep lol. I drink way too many coffees. Though, this being Scotland, drinking (ahem) is generally 'too much'

01:39:53
<transcript>: And that was enough reasons to make her make somebody a vip. Maybe I'm just very addicted because I get a bad headache if I don't have coffee within the first hour of waking up. Yeah. No, that's what it does. Caffeine does that.

01:40:03
<transcript>: Dax is being quiet. Dax, why are you being so quiet? Are you trying to do work and stuff.

01:40:03

<transcript>: Okay.

01:40:32
sussykiel: i dont understand software at all but ur stream has been recommended to me and u are really nice!

01:40:35
charafmrah: Lol

01:40:39

01:40:42
<transcript>: main

01:40:44

01:40:51

01:41:20
thdxr: Adams mom got bored and left

01:41:24
<transcript>: Okay. So now I can actually add that we're going to get this thing actually doing something. And it's going to be super cool because you guys are like, man, he's got nothing done. And then suddenly you're going to see video streaming into this ivs player, and you're going to be like, wow, how did he do all that while also simultaneously looking like he's doing nothing.

01:41:29
<transcript>: As mom got bored and left I told you C plus C plus at best today.

01:41:35
lightyon: hey, you should def make a soundpack for mechvibes so everyone can be using your keyboards haha. They def sound cool

01:41:37
<transcript>: This is not my best if you came and you followed me today or you gave me a prime sub. Wow. Just wait. It gets a lot better.

01:41:37
<transcript>: there

01:41:43
<transcript>: There are days where I'm not coming off caffeine, and I think I'm a little more entertaining than this.

01:41:43
<transcript>: actually maybe

01:41:47
<transcript>: Actually, maybe not. Maybe this has just piqued me. I don't know.

01:41:47
<transcript>: lidian

01:41:48
mattmancodes: questionable

01:41:50
mattmancodes: hahah

01:42:02
terawatthour: is he still trying to pretend kotlin dev is fun or just doesnt care anymore?

01:42:02
<transcript>: Lidian. Welcome to Chat. Hey, you should definitely make a sound pack for mech vibes so everyone could be using your keyboards. They definitely sound so cool. Hey, that's cool. What's a sound pack for mech vibes? I like that you like my keyboards, but what is that? What's a sound pack for mech vibes.

01:42:12
<transcript>: Is he still trying to pretend kotlin dev is fun or just doesn't care anymore a little bit of both.

01:42:12
<transcript>: i'm

01:42:15
<transcript>: I'm not really pretending anything.

01:42:19
smilingbig: this sounds like something we could post in keyboard channel on discord zekeTHINK

01:42:25
<transcript>: It'll be fun when I get this ivs player working. Let's just do it. Okay? A player equals create this player. Add listener, this.

01:42:25
<transcript>: altern

01:42:27
<transcript>: Alternatively.

01:42:32
<transcript>: Initialize by using player Vue.

01:42:35
sehn0: music is cool, it's a spotify playlist ?

01:42:36
<transcript>: Set the surface view for video.

01:42:36
terawatthour: "if you get it working" is very important

01:42:41
<transcript>: I don't like this. Not a bit.

01:42:41
<transcript>: if not

01:42:54
<transcript>: If not using Player View at a Surface view to your Android ui layout for displaying a video, this surface must be available before you can play any video streams, you can access the underlying surface through the Surface holder interface. Oh my goodness.

01:42:56
<transcript>: Oh, my goodness.

01:43:04
lightyon: reproduces keyboard key sound everytime you press akey. kinda hard for me to explain xd is opensource tho

01:43:06
<transcript>: Sin. It is kind of a Spotify playlist. I start with a certain song, a certain album, and then I let it go until it gets into radio and it's generally pretty good.

01:43:15
<transcript>: Reproduces keyboard key sound every time you press a key kind of hard for me to explain. That is so cool so I can record.

01:43:19
<transcript>: Like me typing. So check it out here's. Me typing.

01:43:27
<transcript>: Let's just stop the music and you guys can hear it because I don't do a lot of typing these days. I've not been getting much done, but listen to this.

01:43:36
<transcript>: Sounds pretty good. Right.

01:43:37
thdxr: does it work on Linux

01:43:39
smilingbig: Kreygasm

01:43:40

01:43:44
<transcript>: Good, pretty good.

01:43:44
<transcript>: so

01:43:46
deaconbeacon2: Kreygasm

01:43:49
sussykiel: CRISSSSP

01:43:50
<transcript>: So I record that I could even get my mic a little closer to the keyboard, to get a little better.

01:43:55
<transcript>: Thought Floata plus thank you so much for that. Follow. Floata plus.

01:44:02
<transcript>: So yeah, when I type it sounds really good I should try it more? I should try typing more.

01:44:08
lightyon: yeah exactly Kreygasm

01:44:09
<transcript>: You know what I'm saying? I do a lot of talking. Not a lot of typing. Listen to that.

01:44:16
binajmen: this is nearly erotic if you close your eyes

01:44:18
texoport: that spacebar. god damn

01:44:21
<transcript>: I record it, and then you guys can listen to it in your own headphones when you type. That's pretty cool. That's a good idea. I like that app. That's a cool idea.

01:44:24
mecoupz: which switches are u using on that kb?

01:44:27
<transcript>: If you close your eyes, it's really good. I know it's really good. I should type a lot more.

01:44:27
<transcript>: maybe i should

01:44:31
<transcript>: Maybe I should turn off the music and just play for you guys for a little bit.

01:44:31
<transcript>: just

01:44:34
<transcript>: Just tickle the old keys.

01:44:37
<transcript>: The switches.

01:44:39
<transcript>: Are.

01:44:39
<transcript>: mode signal

01:44:41
<transcript>: Mode signal switches.

01:44:45
vapor__dev: Now stir some oats…

01:44:49
<transcript>: So I don't have another keyboard that sounds this good.

01:44:49
<transcript>: because

01:44:52
<transcript>: Because after some oats how about this.

01:44:55
binajmen: it's like drugs for my ears

01:44:56
<transcript>: You like that? You like that larabar wrapper? Yeah, you do.

01:45:11
<transcript>: So Mode made this one for me. They got me hooked on keyboards, single handedly. It's so weird with that music. It's so silent. Does the silence bother you guys? Is it awkward? Here we go.

01:45:17
funkysetiz: what switch type?

01:45:20
binajmen: it is

01:45:21
smilingbig: KEKW

01:45:23
texoport: tactile?

01:45:31
<transcript>: Like I go the whole stream without not talking. I talked the entire time. My wife asked me like, how do you talk the entire time? I don't know. I just do. I just keep talking. But how about this keyboard sounds so good. They are tactile. Yeah. So mode made me this one and they did all the lubing.

01:45:31
<transcript>: so it

01:45:33
<transcript>: So it sounds amazing.

01:45:33
<transcript>: i did

01:45:41
<transcript>: I did lubing on some of my other keyboards. They do not sound as amazing. Do you want to hear them? I could bring them over. We're not getting anything done.

01:45:41
<transcript>: are we getting

01:45:46
<transcript>: Are we getting something done? We're getting something done. Don't tell dax we're getting something done. But watch this.

01:45:55
<transcript>: So here's another mode keyboard. This one does sound good because mode made this one for me too.

01:45:55
<transcript>: it's

01:45:56
<transcript>: It's different.

01:46:03
<transcript>: But good, right.

01:46:03
<transcript>: so it's

01:46:05
mecoupz: the thing is i need a split/ergonomic or my hands hurt. thats why i use a microsoft sculpt right now :(

01:46:06
<transcript>: So it's mode signal switches on both of these.

01:46:06
binajmen: so you have to build your keyboard by yourself?

01:46:17
jokestera_e: sound like cherry red

01:46:20
<transcript>: But it's totally different backplates and all that, like everything else, is different. This is a copper plate. This one, I think, is a what did I use on this one? I don't remember what plate I used.

01:46:20
smilingbig: first one is better imo

01:46:23
<transcript>: I think it's an Fr. Four.

01:46:28
dmdboi: Ai generated keyboard from his ai generated background

01:46:30
<transcript>: Yeah, the first one's definitely better. This is my best keyboard. Now listen to one that I lubed, are you ready.

01:46:36
<transcript>: It's so bad.

01:46:39
<transcript>: It's so bad you ready.

01:46:39
<transcript>: here

01:46:41
<transcript>: Here we go.

01:46:45
<transcript>: And I guess while I'm doing this, why share my screen.

01:46:45
<transcript>: when i could

01:46:47
<transcript>: When I could do this.

01:46:51
<transcript>: There we go. You can look at my keyboard while I type it.

01:47:00
smilingbig: WutFace

01:47:01
lightyon: oh no

01:47:01
<transcript>: It's so bad. I'm so bad at looing like the modifiers on this thing. The stabs.

01:47:04
<transcript>: Are so poorly lubed.

01:47:08
<transcript>: You like hear a little metal clang.

01:47:12
<transcript>: It's so bad.

01:47:12
<transcript>: so like comp

01:47:15
<transcript>: So like compared to this one? Where is it.

01:47:17
texoport: That's gorgeous tho

01:47:21
smilingbig: my keyboard sounds similar to this atm KEKW

01:47:21
<transcript>: Right.

01:47:26
jokestera_e: def a softer sound

01:47:35
charafmrah: Great for gaming though

01:47:39
<transcript>: The other one looks really nice. It's great for display. Like I did the gold accents. I'm trying to get it in the camera here. So it's got botanical, gmk, botanical. It's a Mode 65. It's got that gold backplate. I've got a matching gold cable that goes with it. It's really nice.

01:47:43
<transcript>: So it looks good. Does not sound good.

01:47:54
<transcript>: How about this mode 65? This just turned into a keyboard stream. Here's a mode 65 that I also looped.

01:47:54
<transcript>: i

01:47:56
<transcript>: I did a little better with this one.

01:48:02
<transcript>: Totally different sound very different these are not mode switches I can't remember.

01:48:02
<transcript>: which ones

01:48:04
<transcript>: Which ones I used on this.

01:48:08
<transcript>: I have to look it up.

01:48:14
<transcript>: Or I could try and take out some keys. This one's not terrible. Totally different sound, though.

01:48:16
<transcript>: So this one.

01:48:16
<transcript>: is another

01:48:21
lightyon: yeah you should def create a soundpack for it, i would rock it for sure

01:48:23
<transcript>: Is another mode. 65. It's a black with a white accent. Gmk Minimal keycaps.

01:48:23
<transcript>: last

01:48:25
<transcript>: Last one coming up.

01:48:39
<transcript>: I know. Nobody asked for this. You didn't ask for a keyboard sound test.

01:48:39
<transcript>: so this one

01:48:42
<transcript>: So this one is another mode 80.

01:48:45
<transcript>: It's a white mode 80 with.

01:48:45
<transcript>: what are these keyc

01:48:48
<transcript>: What are these keycaps called? I forgot.

01:48:50
binajmen: ooouh I like to old'ish style

01:48:50
<transcript>: They're a different profile.

01:48:54
lightyon: mt3

01:48:55
<transcript>: I had to lose these as well.

01:48:56
texoport: DSA?

01:48:57
<transcript>: Not the best.

<transcript>: But it's going to look really cool because I've got, like, a wide Oak accent. It's another sonnet. I've got a white Oak accent. And it's got a white one. So white sonnet, with white Oak, it's going to look like my house because my house is just white walls and white Oak everywhere.

01:59:43
<transcript>: It just became kind of annoying. So we're going to try it this way.

02:07:48
thdxr: I disabled auth on the endpoints the app needs

02:07:49
<transcript>: The chance that the MacBook thing is cluttering up my activity, it's cluttering up my chat. I got to figure it out. Maybe we just make it cost more points.

02:07:54
<transcript>: And you can only do it so often and you have a higher chance. Maybe.

02:07:58
night_light90: @adamdotdev you put the permissions tags inside AndroidManifest.xml file

02:07:58
<transcript>: Adam, not your friend. That's so I'm all your friends.

02:08:02

02:08:02

02:08:17
autostealth: Oh how has GPT been treating you for code? Do you have to do a lot of cleaning?

02:08:22
<transcript>: You guys are funny. I remember when you offered a kinesis 360 with your homemade script. Did not win, though. Yeah, we did a giveaway for it. I've got a button now I can press and do a giveaway on command. Jay lurkin, thank you so much for that follow. I appreciate that. Follow better with a low chance. Okay, we'll stick with that.

02:08:27
<transcript>: I disabled off on the endpoints. Oh, perfect.

02:08:32
kryotoboi: Woah 😳 I didn't win

02:08:32
<transcript>: Let's see Auto stealth. Your name is so cool looking.

02:08:35
<transcript>: Beta tester paint beta tester.

02:08:55
<transcript>: How has gpt been treating you for code? Do you have to do a lot of cleaning? It's great. And sometimes it's like, out of date. It'll be like, oh, man, it's not getting all of this. Sometimes it'll be out of date, like it'll be using an old version of a library or something, and you have to fiddle with it a little bit. But it's no different than finding an out of date example on Stack overflow, I guess.

02:08:55
<transcript>: you

02:09:00
<transcript>: You can be so specific, and it's amazing what it can put together for you.

02:09:03

02:09:03
<transcript>: dax

02:09:08
<transcript>: Dax, did you just now try? Did you reset your attempts or something? Because you're a moderator. You would.

02:09:08
<transcript>: do

02:09:10
<transcript>: Do that.

02:09:14
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:09:16
thdxr: I did say I was scheming

02:09:20
<transcript>: You put the permissions Tags inside Android manifest, but do you put them inside.

02:09:22
<transcript>: Like.

02:09:22
<transcript>: where

02:09:24
<transcript>: Where like right here.

02:09:24
<transcript>: in the application

02:09:26
coolpantstv: @thdxr that's despicable (reset me pls)

02:09:27
<transcript>: In the application tag like Where do they belong.

02:09:33
binajmen: outside application tag

02:09:35
<transcript>: Because they could go anywhere they could go inside the activity, inside the application. Inside the manifest. I don't know where they go.

02:09:38
<transcript>: You did say you were scheming.

02:09:43
aisebaxp: There's an extension for vs code to help you code codeGPT

02:09:44

02:10:02
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, I've seen that the Chat gbt embedded in Vs code. I saw that.

02:10:24
zarcmultidimensionalzebra: Hello

02:10:25
<transcript>: I don't know if this is better than the docs. I feel like the docs are pretty good. What? I don't know. This refers to current Android Player Activity class. What.

02:10:25
<transcript>: player

02:10:28
<transcript>: Player Activity class.

02:10:34
<transcript>: Okay. So I should be able to copy this code in somewhere.

02:10:36
<transcript>: In here.

02:10:36
<transcript>: oh

02:10:37
kryotoboi: What if I ask chatGpt to write an AI better that gpt itself  ?

02:10:40

02:10:40
<transcript>: set

02:10:41
<transcript>: Set content.

02:10:48
<transcript>: I'm just pasting code. I don't know if this is the right place.

02:10:51

02:11:05
mono_nz: android studio would tell you its in the wrong place btw (but you want it on like line3)

02:11:09
<transcript>: There's many for neo V. Two.

02:11:09
zarcmultidimensionalzebra: Ez yes

02:11:17
<transcript>: Use above application inside uses sdk oh, good to know. Thank you.

02:11:17
<transcript>: uses

02:11:19
<transcript>: Uses SDK.

02:11:22
<transcript>: I have to make a user's SDK.

02:11:25
<transcript>: Like up here.

02:11:30
<transcript>: So I have to do like uses SDK.

02:11:36
<transcript>: I haven't written XML.

02:11:36
<transcript>: in i don't even

02:11:37
<transcript>: In I don't even know.

02:11:43
<transcript>: I don't even know the last time I wrote xml. What am I doing.

02:11:45
zarcmultidimensionalzebra: Nah I saw you coding so I joined, I'm on a journey to learn so I'm in taking everything from everywhere

02:11:47
kenqzzzz: xml LUL

02:11:49
<transcript>: Okay. I'm trying to format stuff because this is the Dark Ages, and we don't even have prettier.

02:11:52
<transcript>: So weird.

02:11:52
<transcript>: okay

02:11:55
<transcript>: Okay. Use this permission. We're going to try that.

02:12:01
iannery: @binajmen i think GPT does not scrape websites, it just uses the link context (like if it has any information)

02:12:02
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Night Light. Thank you for the tip. Inside uses SDK.

02:12:02
<transcript>: okay

02:12:03
<transcript>: Okay.

02:12:08
<transcript>: Inward studio would tell you it's in the wrong place that you want it on like line three.

02:12:14
<transcript>: Okay. I think that's good. One, two, three. Yeah. Like right here.

02:12:20
thdxr: damn adam properly implemented twitch webhook verification

02:12:22
<transcript>: Android studio would tell me oh, because I'm trying to use let's just go back to Android studio.

02:12:22
<transcript>: i don't think i'm gain

02:12:24
thdxr: almost had him hacked!

02:12:26
coolpantstv: every stream I hear @adamdotdev is saying that prettier is broken lol

02:12:28
<transcript>: I don't think I'm gaining anything by using my goofy neo vim setup with this stuff.

02:12:28
<transcript>: so

02:12:32
charafmrah: The song is a vibe

02:12:37
binajmen: @binajmen Sad

02:12:41
<transcript>: So let's see. Where was that? The Build gradle? No. Is the app manifest? Android manifest. Here we go. This is where I added it. Is it happy with it seems happy.

02:12:41
<transcript>: i

02:12:45
<transcript>: I don't see any complaint. Oh, wait, no, not happy.

02:12:45
<transcript>: use

02:12:46
<transcript>: Use this permission.

02:12:57
<transcript>: Or should it be you can tell me user version must be a direct child okay so not uses SDK.

02:13:00
<transcript>: Not this.

02:13:04
<transcript>: Just a direct child.

02:13:09
<transcript>: Okay, let's make an http request. Let's see if we can figure out how to do that.

02:13:09
mono_nz: remove uses-sdk

02:13:11
<transcript>: What did I just do.

02:13:19
<transcript>: Should I just close the file? Do I save it? Okay. Main activity. So this is not how this works.

02:13:19
<transcript>: i don

02:13:21
<transcript>: I don't believe.

02:13:24
<transcript>: I do need to import.

02:13:28
<transcript>: A thing.

02:13:32
<transcript>: Right.

02:13:36
<transcript>: Guessing I have to import that here.

02:13:39
<transcript>: Player view.

02:13:47
<transcript>: Add listener.

02:13:57
<transcript>: I think I'm doing this in the wrong place. Maybe.

02:14:03
<transcript>: It's in the wrong place.

02:14:10
<transcript>: This song is a vibe.

02:14:16
<transcript>: Cool dance? Every stream? I hear? Adam dev is saying that prettier is broken. Well, I don't even have it here.

02:14:17
mono_nz: you can paste that java awas code into android studio and it will convert it to kotlin for you

02:14:22
<transcript>: Adam properly implemented twitch webhook verification. Yeah, I did actually think I am.

02:14:30
<transcript>: You think I just let anybody hit my webhook? That's funny. You actually try to hit my webhooks. I love it so much.

02:14:33
<transcript>: Almost at.

02:14:39
<transcript>: I love that you spent time on that. I don't feel bad about wasting all my time. Okay, here we go.

02:14:50
thdxr: imma eat one too

02:14:56
<transcript>: Too hungry. Can't wait. It's time to eat. Alar. Sponsored by lara Bar. Not yet. But won't that be cool when I'm sponsored by Larbar someday? Like, what's? That guy? That hustle guy that wants to own the Jets.

02:15:01
<transcript>: What's his name.

02:15:05
<transcript>: Dax is going to eat one, too.

elliot0x01: yoooo

02:15:18
<transcript>: That guy that wants to own the jets. It's like his whole thing. He wants to own the jets. Gary vee? Yeah, it's like Gary vee with the jets. My goal is just to be sponsored by larabar. Someday, it's going to happen. You could be here when it does.

02:15:24
elliot0x01: What's up

02:15:26
<transcript>: Camera quality is unreal. It is good. It is good. Welcome to Chat captain's. Best.

02:15:34
<transcript>: What's going on, elliot? We're just eating a larbar. Me and DAX.

02:15:46
<transcript>: Dax, we should just have you on my stream all the time. You should just always if you're going to be hanging out in chat, you might as well just be on the camera.

02:15:51
<transcript>: It's by lara by thought of the day.

02:15:52
thdxr: ok cool so 4 hours in your stream, 2 hours in mine

02:15:53
iannery: I agree

02:15:57
<transcript>: See this building. This building is not lit up.

02:15:57
<transcript>: and i have

02:16:02
<transcript>: And I have ocpd, and it drives me crazy? I'll be right back.

02:16:13
elliot0x01: Is that bar healthy if I eat 10 a day ?

02:16:29
jokestera_e: call an electrician

02:16:30
<transcript>: I've got like a short in the wires or something.

02:16:31
aisebaxp: @thdxr your stream?? Isnt your dog stream? Hehehe

02:16:36
iannery: @elliot0x01 probably not but worth trying

02:16:37
tropichana: I haven’t eaten a larabar in years I think you and Dax are influencing me to buy one lol

02:16:38
<transcript>: Call an electrician. I guess I could. I don't think I need to.

02:16:50
<transcript>: Okay cool. So 4 hours in your stream 2 hours.

02:16:54
<transcript>: Cool. We got a deal. Okay.

02:16:58
<transcript>: Is it healthy if you eat ten a day? No.

02:16:58
<transcript>: also not

02:17:02
<transcript>: Also not healthy if you eat four a day, which is what I do a lot.

02:17:02
<transcript>: they're

02:17:04
<transcript>: They're so good.

02:17:19
<transcript>: Tropic. You've had them. But you have an eaten one in years. We're influencing you. They're so good. Peanut butter, chocolate chip is really the only way to go.

02:17:33
<transcript>: Dax.

02:17:38
<transcript>: You should start a little earlier today so I can throw it to you.

02:17:38
<transcript>: a little

02:17:43
<transcript>: A little early. I know you're starting with Aaron.

02:17:43
<transcript>: on the top

02:17:45
<transcript>: On the top of the hour.

02:17:45
thdxr: I'm gonna start at 10

02:17:47
thdxr: my itme

02:17:52
<transcript>: Ten year time.

02:17:55
<transcript>: Oh, you're starting in 20 minutes. Cool.

02:17:55
<transcript>: i'd like

02:18:00
<transcript>: I'd like to throw it to you before ten so I can get to the coffee place by ten.

02:18:04
<transcript>: I like to throw it to you when it's not on a Loading screen.

02:18:08
thdxr: lolol

02:18:19
<transcript>: Okay, but how are you going to wait next? How are you going to start your stream in 20 minutes? If you're joining my stream for the next hour and 20 minutes. I'm just kidding.

02:18:23
<transcript>: All right, send me some good tweets.

02:18:24
elliot0x01: Do they have different flavours and stuff? Which one you eating? the original one?

02:18:25
<transcript>: Give me something.

02:18:30
<transcript>: To laugh at or cry over.

02:18:30
<transcript>: something

02:18:33
<transcript>: Something just give me something.

02:18:39
<transcript>: Yoast, do you mind if I read your Tweet? Yes. Live on Twitch.

02:18:42
elliot0x01: Peanut Butter Choco chip ?

02:18:43
<transcript>: Is this okay? It's the first thing in my feed.

02:18:45
joostschuur: Sure?

02:18:46
<transcript>: Oh, it's a fire.

02:18:46
<transcript>: touch

02:18:47
<transcript>: Touch.

02:18:52
<transcript>: Sure. You're okay with it? Okay. Peterburg. Tower. Chip. That's right. Elliot.

02:18:52
<transcript>: pean

02:18:54
joostschuur: Oh, nmy reply

02:18:59
joostschuur: Yeah

02:19:01
fragaverage: Fire Touch lmao

02:19:03
fragaverage: HOT TAKE

02:19:12
<transcript>: Peanut butter chocolate chip is the only way to go. It's their best selling bar and it's the best tasting okay for some of us. Me Twitter provides too much info and distraction, removing useful info by degrading for you and then only seeing some tweets from people you do care about in a chronologically sorted following tab could be a good thing for them. Is that what they're doing? By the way.

02:19:14
<transcript>: Is that where it's headed.

02:19:19
<transcript>: Like following is just chronological right in four years.

02:19:24
<transcript>: They're changing or something. I read this. Did I see a Tweet or what? Did I see.

02:19:27
<transcript>: Oh, hot take.

02:19:27
<transcript>: fire

02:19:30
<transcript>: Fire, touch? I don't know. Looks like fire touch.

02:19:30
<transcript>: he's touching the

02:19:32
<transcript>: He's touching the colon.

02:19:34
<transcript>: Okay.

02:19:37
livemahs: https://twitter.com/ProManimalUnity/status/1631413463607308288

02:19:39
<transcript>: One useful feature for the following tab is someone you follow. Replies.

02:19:41
livemahs: here's a good one

02:19:50
<transcript>: Okay, it bumps your original tweet back up in the timeline. So by curating who you follow, you've created your own little algorithm that makes popular Tweets from followers rise to the top. That sounds fantastic, joe's. I like it.

02:19:59
<transcript>: Points out this would only affect recommendations a crucial distinction if E didn't consider the whole fy tab. Recommendations.

02:20:01
joostschuur: That’s the distinction in the followup tweet. If it just affects specific recomemnded tweets, this doesn’t break the FY page recommendations

02:20:05
<transcript>: I got you just not saying the name I got you.

02:20:09
<transcript>: Live maz. Here's a good one. Let's see what it is.

02:20:11
menschen1: i have problem with tutorial hell when learning new technology, any advice?

02:20:17
elliot0x01: Gotta try a larbar now

02:20:20
<transcript>: No context. Curb your enthusiasm. It's not that I'm not working as hard, but it looks more effortless. Maybe.

02:20:28
<transcript>: Is this supposed to be pointed at me.

02:20:30
elliot0x01: Only if they available in my country :|

02:20:33
<transcript>: And how much I'm not getting done.

02:20:41
<transcript>: Yo that's the distinction in the follow up tweet if it just affects specific recommended tweets that doesn't break the for you page recommendations.

02:20:41
<transcript>: i got

02:20:43
<transcript>: I got you.

02:20:47
joostschuur: I think you should never assume Elon actually means literally what he tweetsd

02:20:52
<transcript>: Minshin. Welcome to Chat. I have a problem with tutorial. Hell, when learning new technology. Any advice? Yes. Okay. We have advice for this.

02:20:58
joostschuur: I mean, the Twitter API still works ;0

02:21:04
<transcript>: I say we because it's like collectively, as a group, we've come up with this and we've refined it over time because a lot of people ask this question, and the answer is you need something that you want to build.

02:21:04
<transcript>: that you

02:21:06
<transcript>: That you want to exist.

02:21:06
<transcript>: so

02:21:16
<transcript>: So my wife wants a cooking app, not a cooking app. She wants a recipe app. We have to spend an hour every week coming up with a grocery list based on all the things we're going to make that week.

02:21:33
<transcript>: And she wants me to automate that and just make a thing where she can ingest all of the recipes. And it just spits out a meal plan and a recipe or a shopping list every week. So she wants that to exist. And if my wife wants something to exist, I want it to exist because I want my wife to be happy. So now I have an incentive.

02:21:33
<transcript>: and i'm going to

02:21:39
elliot0x01: Mind giving your thoughts on pynecone ? https://pynecone.io

02:21:41
fragaverage: I think thats a calculator Adam

02:21:49
<transcript>: And I'm going to work very hard to get that thing out there. I'm going to make sure I make it happen. You need something like that. If you're just making, like, in tutorials, if they make you make like a clone of something and it just like, you don't care. You don't actually want to make a clone of something because what's the point? It already exists.

02:21:49
<transcript>: it's just going to

02:21:51
<transcript>: It's just going to be hard to push through.

02:21:51
<transcript>: and really sol

02:21:55
<transcript>: And really solve the problems that need to be solved and get something shipped.

02:21:55
<transcript>: so my

02:22:02
<transcript>: So my recommendation is find something that you want to exist. There's so many things out there in the digital world that are lacking.

02:22:02
<transcript>: come up with something

02:22:08
<transcript>: Come up with something that would make your life better. Build it. That's it.

02:22:11
<transcript>: That's a calculator? What's a calculator.

02:22:15
nikolaxhristov: Kotliiiin!

02:22:18
coolpantstv: I'm really passionate about todo lists, so tutorials are great for me!

02:22:19
nikolaxhristov: PogChamp

02:22:25
<transcript>: Got to try Larbar now. Yeah, you do, elliot. Only if they're available in my country. That bums me out. That lar bars might not be available in every country.

02:22:33
fragaverage: nothing im just being a troll whilst cloudformation sucks the soul out of me

02:22:50
<transcript>: I think you should never assume elon actually means literally what he tweeted true. The Twitter api still works. It's true. Nikolax kotlin, we're doing kotlin today. We're just on Twitter right now being distracted for a minute. Mind giving your thoughts on pine cone. So this is interesting. I learned a pine cone, like four days ago.

02:22:50
<transcript>: and then

02:22:56
<transcript>: And then I see it constantly now I'm singing in my Twitch chat so, Pine Cone? What I know about Pine Cone.

02:22:56

<transcript>: This syntax. Set content. So this is like our render function right here. Set content.

02:30:22
<transcript>: Composes the given composable into the given activity. The content will become the root view of the given activity, roughly equivalent to calling component activity at set content view with a compose view.

<transcript>: I think so.

02:33:06
<transcript>: no

02:33:11

<transcript>: Let's do this.

02:38:15
<transcript>: Let's do this. Not that.

02:38:15
<transcript>: we're going to make

02:38:18
<transcript>: We're going to make a new file. I guess.

02:38:18
<transcript>: we're going to

02:38:21
<transcript>: We're going to add it just right here. I'm going to call it.

02:38:23
<transcript>: New.

02:38:31
<transcript>: It's a new what.

02:38:37
<transcript>: Kotlin class file. Is that just KT.

02:38:42
<transcript>: Kotlin class file.

02:38:44
<transcript>: Maybe.

02:38:46
<transcript>: Name.

02:38:47
captainsebest: file

02:38:53
<transcript>: Ivs player. Composable.

02:38:56
stroopwafel26: In another episode of "CDK is stupid": EKS supports version 1.25 which requires v2.4.7 of the ALB controller but the albController class hasn't been updated yet to support that version so you can't deploy a 1.25 EKS cluster and deploy the ALB controller at the same time MaxLOL

02:38:57
<transcript>: So right here.

02:38:57
<transcript>: new

02:38:58
<transcript>: New.

02:39:03
<transcript>: Ivs player. Composable.

02:39:08
funkysetiz: have you checked this one? https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-ivs-player-android-sample

02:39:09
<transcript>: Do you want to add the following file to get no cancel.

02:39:16
<transcript>: Okay, so this is a kt. Oh, but look, it has a different little picture.

02:39:20
<transcript>: I want this to be a dot kt file.

02:39:23
<transcript>: Rename.

02:39:33
<transcript>: How do I rename.

02:39:33
mecoupz: adam shows exactly the reason why being a mobile dev is not fun

02:39:36
captainsebest: just delete the class

02:39:37
<transcript>: I want to rename you.

02:39:40
im_noxz: refactor

02:39:44
funkysetiz: there's a quizzdemo on it

02:39:44
<transcript>: Oh, this is so painful. Okay, we're deleting that one, and we're going to add a new what.

02:39:46
<transcript>: Add a new.

02:39:48
meranofox: loll

02:39:50
zoro1800: refactor-rename

02:39:50
captainsebest: new File

02:39:51
cowfacedev: I want to cancel my sub.... no neovim LUL

02:39:51
<transcript>: Kotlin Script kotlin worksheet.

02:39:54
im_noxz: rename is behind refactor

02:39:54
<transcript>: Ui component.

02:39:57
<transcript>: Activity.

02:39:57
<transcript>: activ

02:40:02
<transcript>: Activity. Blank activity. Basic activity.

02:40:03
captainsebest: new file

02:40:04
<transcript>: Oh, my word.

02:40:09
mecoupz: empty activity?

02:40:12
<transcript>: No neo vim. Yeah. Feels bad. Refactor. Rename. Okay.

02:40:12
<transcript>: that could have worked

02:40:15
<transcript>: That could have worked luan thanks so much for the follow.

02:40:16
cowfacedev: although it is fun to see you struggle.....

02:40:20
<transcript>: Funky? Is that a good one.

02:40:23
<transcript>: Is that a good example.

02:40:27
mono_nz: you were right first, new kotlin file

02:40:31
<transcript>: Delete the class it is fun to see me straw.

02:40:31
<transcript>: i

02:40:34
<transcript>: I'm glad you enjoy something.

02:40:37
<transcript>: Enjoyable here.

02:40:37
<transcript>: new

02:40:40
<transcript>: New kotlin file. I was right. Okay. New.

02:40:43
<transcript>: Kotlin file.

02:40:49
<transcript>: Okay. And I'm going to name it. I'm going to add kt at the end this time. Ivf. Player. Composable.

02:40:52
<transcript>: Kt. I feel like.

02:40:52
<transcript>: what when

02:40:54
randomsquid12: Why dont you learn android dev first?

02:40:55
<transcript>: What when I ask again.

02:40:59
captainsebest: have to select file instead of class

02:41:00
<transcript>: Okay. It just doesn't say kt, but I think that's okay.

02:41:00
<transcript>: we're going to

02:41:02
<transcript>: We're going to paste.

02:41:05
<transcript>: Not like this.

02:41:05
<transcript>: and my brain

02:41:09
<transcript>: And my brain is just moving, so slow, people, it's so slow.

02:41:09
<transcript>: it's the no

02:41:13
<transcript>: It's the no caffeine. I'm coming off caffeine. And it's so painful.

02:41:13
<transcript>: let's see

02:41:14
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:41:15
mono_nz: it only puts .kt in there when there are more than one class in the file

02:41:20
<transcript>: Quiz demo? What? Are you kidding me.

02:41:24
<transcript>: Let's take a look at that.

02:41:29
<transcript>: How cool would it be if I could just use a bunch of this code.

02:41:37
<transcript>: Why don't you learn Android dev first random squid. Welcome to Chat. I am learning Android dev right phone doing right now.

02:41:37
<transcript>: i think

02:41:38
<transcript>: I think.

02:41:38
<transcript>: rich

02:41:42
<transcript>: Rich. Hexlabs thank you for that. Follow.

02:41:44
stroopwafel26: we're learning chat

02:41:46
<transcript>: Zoro. Welcome to Chat as well.

02:41:46
<transcript>: funky

02:41:50
<transcript>: Funky were trying to tell me there's a quiz demo in it.

02:41:53
<transcript>: And I was just slow.

02:41:53
<transcript>: my

02:41:57
<transcript>: My brain is so slow right now. Source Main I want to look what this looks like.

02:42:04
<transcript>: Is this using jetpack something.

02:42:09
<transcript>: So many folders, so many files.

02:42:09
<transcript>: it's just

02:42:09
captainsebest: Android Studio is a pain haha

02:42:12
<transcript>: It's just insane. How many files there are.

02:42:18
stroopwafel26: in my head i always pronounce gradle like it's a french word

02:42:24
stroopwafel26: gradlé

02:42:25
<transcript>: This is not the composable thing, is it jetpack.

02:42:28
<transcript>: We're learning, we're learning.

02:42:40
<transcript>: I can't believe I'm going to have to use view models.

02:42:49
<transcript>: Man.

02:42:54
<transcript>: There's a lot of things wrong with web dev, but.

02:42:57
im_noxz: look for @composable to see if it is jetpack

02:42:58
<transcript>: Then I do Mobile Dev, and I remember Web Dev is amazing.

02:42:58
<transcript>: so

02:43:00
<transcript>: So good.

02:43:05
<transcript>: Answer, adapter, what are adapters.

02:43:10
mono_nz: some things are just the old way and you can wrap them in a composable using AndroidView { } which chatgpt is telling you.

02:43:11
<transcript>: Okay.

02:43:15
randomsquid12: ViewModel is good, because if you flip phone you dont lose all the data

02:43:21
<transcript>: So view models main view model.

02:43:23
<transcript>: Live stream.

02:43:32
<transcript>: Oh, that's what Chad gbc is telling me, Mano.

02:43:34
<transcript>: That sounds kind of like.

02:43:40
<transcript>: View model is good because if you flip phone you don't lose all the data. What.

02:43:43
<transcript>: You need a view model to prevent that.

02:43:44
sh4dowmonk: @captainsebest you should see Eclipse or Netbeans :D

02:43:47
<transcript>: That sounds kind of like.

02:43:52
smilingbig: KEKW

02:43:57
<transcript>: Kind of like in Neil vim. You can still use old vim stuff and just wrap it in lure or something.

02:43:57
<transcript>: you should

02:44:02
<transcript>: You should see eclipse or netbeans. Are they worse? Welcome to Chat. Shadow monk. Welcome.

02:44:05
<transcript>: Okay.

02:44:10
<transcript>: So this is where they're actually creating a player media player.

02:44:10
<transcript>: what

02:44:13
<transcript>: What is Media player, though.

02:44:18
randomsquid12: Yes, because fragment/activity class gets destroyed and created again when you flip phone, so you lose all data that was in the class

02:44:19
<transcript>: Media Player ivs, Media player.

02:44:19
<transcript>: is different

02:44:24
<transcript>: Is different from ivs player thank you for the follow dimadev.

02:44:35
<transcript>: Fragment activity class gets destroyed and created again when you flip phone so you lose all data that was in the class. Yeah. Okay.

02:44:35
<transcript>: i get

02:44:37
<transcript>: I get the idea of.

02:44:43
<transcript>: Managing application state I just don't understand why I have to use.

02:44:43
<transcript>: view model

02:44:48
<transcript>: View model approaches. There's just so many files, it's just so Java.

02:44:57
<transcript>: Just so like Javaized, which is fine. I guess I feel like I should start with this app and see what it does when you run it.

02:44:57
<transcript>: right

02:44:58
<transcript>: Right.

02:44:58
<transcript>: this feels pretty good

02:45:02
<transcript>: This feels pretty good. Three weeks ago. Okay.

02:45:08
<transcript>: It's just so much code. I can't get over how much code.

02:45:08
<transcript>: this is

02:45:09
<transcript>: This is.

02:45:12
randomsquid12: You also have viewmodels in swift

02:45:13
<transcript>: To accomplish what we're trying to accomplish.

02:45:18
mono_nz: start withh that sample

02:45:21
captainsebest: @sh4dowmonk don't get me started on eclipse haha

02:45:22
<transcript>: Let's see you also have view models in Swift. Okay, so it's the same.

02:45:23
lotuspixiee: isnt kotlin a better java

02:45:29
<transcript>: Start with that sample. Yeah. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's see. How do I want to do this? I'm going to download.

02:45:32
<transcript>: Quiz demo this is the folder, right.

02:45:35
<transcript>: How do I just download the.

02:45:35
<transcript>: folder

02:45:39
<transcript>: Folder. I guess I have to download the whole repo. Probably.

02:45:43
<transcript>: Just going to download it like a zip.

02:45:48
<transcript>: Isn't kotlin a better java? I think so.

02:45:51
<transcript>: Okay.

02:45:55
<transcript>: Gradle quiz demo.

02:45:57
<transcript>: Source.

02:46:02
<transcript>: So wait a minute. Is this actually the root directory? Or do I need, like the whole thing.

02:46:04
mecoupz: just make a webview that shows a astro site :D

02:46:04
captainsebest: the first hours in mobile dev are just spent setting up the environment lol

02:46:05
<transcript>: So I need the whole thing.

02:46:10
<transcript>: Just make a web view that shows an astro size.

02:46:17
<transcript>: The first hours in mobile device spent setting up the environment. Sounds like the first hours in web Dev.

02:46:20
<transcript>: Okay.

02:46:28
<transcript>: I guess this whole thing is one project. Maybe settings are cradle. How do I open a let's just go to Android studio.

02:46:31
<transcript>: Let's close this thing.

02:46:37
<transcript>: File. Close project. Get out of here. Terminate.

02:46:37
<transcript>: okay

02:46:40
<transcript>: Okay, let's do new or open.

02:46:45
<transcript>: And let's go to downloads, and let's open this thing.

02:46:48
<transcript>: Yes. Trust it.

02:46:51
<transcript>: Okay.

02:46:56
<transcript>: What do we got here? What do we got.

02:47:04
<transcript>: Sample setup, install and setup Android Studio Done clone it. Open the project in Android Studio you can now build and run the sample projects.

02:47:04
<transcript>: okay

02:47:05
<transcript>: Okay.

02:47:13
<transcript>: Quiz. How do I build and run the sample project? Oh, it's Loading. Oh, it's doing that thing. It does.

02:47:13
<transcript>: it's doing

02:47:15
<transcript>: It's doing that thing it does.

02:47:17
mono_nz: time for another big gradle sync =P

02:47:23
<transcript>: I think I'm going to go have coffee again and I'm going to come back tomorrow.

02:47:23
<transcript>: and

02:47:28
<transcript>: And I'm going to be coming off coffee again, and I'm going to be slow all week.

02:47:35
<transcript>: The brain. It's just moving so slow today. I literally feel like when I speak.

02:47:35
<transcript>: i feel like

02:47:39
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: Hah....throwing in the Towel

02:47:40
<transcript>: I feel like my tongue can't move as fast as normal. Does that make sense.

02:47:48
randomsquid12: are you downloading gradle wrapper every time?

02:47:51
lotuspixiee: what is gradle, i've seen it multiple times

02:47:53
<transcript>: Throwing in the towel. I'm just waiting on gradle or whatever is happening. There's like a ton of stuff that happens, and it loads for 15 minutes. So I thought I'd come over here and talk.

02:47:53
<transcript>: are you

02:47:57
<transcript>: Are you downloading gradle wrapper every time? I don't know. Maybe.

02:47:58
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: @adamdotdev  Drink a bit of water with salt...it'll help you for mental aspect

02:48:00
<transcript>: What is gradle? I also don't know.

02:48:04
<transcript>: Someone tell us what is gradle.

02:48:04
<transcript>: dri

02:48:10
<transcript>: Drink a bit of water with salt. It'll help you from mental aspect. Really, enrico, is that true.

02:48:12
randomsquid12: build system

02:48:12
<transcript>: Is that so.

02:48:13
mattmancodes: @LotusPixiee it is the Java package manager

02:48:14
mecoupz: nobody knows what gradle is

02:48:20
<transcript>: Yeah. I'm going to go drink some coffee with caffeine in it. And I know that'll help.

02:48:20
<transcript>: i just

02:48:24
thechosenone1080: :(

02:48:25
<transcript>: I just hate that now. I feel like I'm already dependent on coffee again.

02:48:29
mono_nz: sorry, I'm a mobile dev and I freaking love android/ios dev. Can't do web dev - too many ways to skin a cat

02:48:31
<transcript>: I'd gotten over coffee. I had moved on in life.

02:48:34
<transcript>: And I'm back.

02:48:34
<transcript>: i'm back

02:48:36
<transcript>: I'm back, I'm back.

02:48:39
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: ...because you ARE dependant...^^

02:48:43
<transcript>: So this is fun. Mobile. Dev is fun. Are we having fun? Who's having fun? Anybody.

02:48:44
lotuspixiee: ohh I see, ty ty

02:48:48
zol0: Ok surely I will win this second time

02:48:53
mecoupz: coffee is good

02:48:58
thechosenone1080: stop looking into my soul

02:48:59
<transcript>: Sorry, I'm a mobile Dev, and I freaking love Android iOS. Dev can't do web Dev. Too many ways to skin a cat. Yeah, I guess that's true. You have more guided paths in mobile like you have fewer choices. It's like got to use this terrible thing.

02:49:02
<transcript>: Can't use anything else. I guess that's okay.

02:49:06
<transcript>: I'm just messing. It's not terrible.

02:49:08
manbravegg: One of us, One of us, coffee, coffee, coffee.

02:49:10
<transcript>: It's a little painful getting into the swing.

02:49:13
smilingbig: KEKW

02:49:17
<transcript>: Chosen one why are you sad? Oh, because you didn't win.

02:49:17
<transcript>: yeah we need

02:49:20
<transcript>: Yeah. We need to change that. I'm going to have it.

02:49:20
<transcript>: not

02:49:23
<transcript>: Not message the channel every time someone doesn't win.

02:49:23
<transcript>: one of us

02:49:26
<transcript>: One of us, one of us coffee.

02:49:26
<transcript>: i gave up

02:49:29
<transcript>: I gave up coffee so long ago.

02:49:31
<transcript>: At this point.

02:49:34
<transcript>: I don't have an option to go back.

02:49:41
<transcript>: I've spoiled my wife. She likes it when I don't drink coffee.

02:49:43
thechosenone1080: i drank a monster everyday during my masters

02:49:46
<transcript>: And once you've given something to your wife something good you can't take it away.

02:49:46
<transcript>: you drink

02:49:50
<transcript>: You drink a monster every day during your Masters.

02:49:50
<transcript>: i bet

02:49:51
<transcript>: I bet that.

02:49:52
randomsquid12: Mobile dev is quite different to web dev, so dont try to solve problems the same way

02:49:54
mattmancodes: don't be sad if you don't win the macbook, none of us will. not saying it's a scam but...

02:49:56
<transcript>: I had you feeling the caffeine? Were you addicted? So addicted to caffeine.

02:49:56
<transcript>: i bet

02:49:58
<transcript>: I bet.

02:50:06
unknownvs13: What's the downside of caffeine?

02:50:09
thechosenone1080: i was addicted to the sugar not the caffiene

02:50:09
<transcript>: Mobile Dev is quite different to web Dev, so don't try to solve problems the same way. Don't be sad if you don't win the MacBook none of us will not saying it's a scam, but it's not a scam.

02:50:15
aisebaxp: Happy wife, happy life! Miserable husband LUL

02:50:17
mattmancodes: haha

02:50:17
<transcript>: What's the downside of caffeine? I guess the downside of caffeine is that you become dependent, and then you have to have caffeine.

02:50:22
<transcript>: Or you feel awful and your brain is slow. Like right now, for me.

02:50:25
<transcript>: Jill gomez, thank you so much for that. Follow.

02:50:34
<transcript>: I was addicted to the sugar, not the caffeine. That makes sense. That's a lot of sugar, too. Happy wife, happy life. Miserable husband.

02:50:34
<transcript>: i'm not

02:50:39
<transcript>: I'm not miserable, but that's a very true saying. Happy wife, happy life.

02:50:48
zxshan: Caffeine is just a fatigue suppressant right?

02:50:49
<transcript>: So I'm over here waiting on gradle or whatever to do its thing. Android gradle plugin can be upgraded. Okay.

02:50:49
<transcript>: i think

02:50:55
mono_nz: still a lot of ways to build an android app. compose is formalising it a bit more I reckon. agree, web dev is very different

02:50:56
the_real_enrico_pallazzo: @zxshan yes

02:50:57
<transcript>: I think it's done. I think it's done. Let me try and build it. And then if it doesn't work, I won't have just gone over there to come back.

02:50:57
<transcript>: i

02:51:04
<transcript>: I legitimately might just stop streaming here soon. I'm not even going to make it but I'll make it to 3 hours. We got ten minutes left.

02:51:09
jenswoeste: good afternoon adam. hows the coffee?

02:51:10
<transcript>: Ten minutes left. And then I need to lie down or something.

02:51:10
<transcript>: my

02:51:12
braindevnull: Just bought ~20 litres of mate tea lemonade (~100mg caffeine / bottle) for my masters...

02:51:14
<transcript>: My brain. My brain is so slow.

02:51:18
<transcript>: Good afternoon, Adam. How's the coffee? Yens.

02:51:21
zxshan: @zxshan Feel like it has a placeo effect

02:51:26
zxshan: placebo

02:51:29
aisebaxp: Italian style coffee

02:51:29
<transcript>: We're talking about coffee right now. I made my little morning teaser thing about coffee. And I'm getting coffee here and in, like 30 minutes with some friends from Twitch.

02:51:32
<transcript>: Some maliro.

02:51:40
aisebaxp: Don't do the black coffee please

02:51:42
<transcript>: And live maz aka Jordan. We're going to go meet here in nixa and have coffee in 30 minutes. But I'm coming off coffee today.

02:51:42
<transcript>: and my brain is so slow

02:51:43
<transcript>: And my brain is so slow.

02:51:43
<transcript>: i feel like

02:51:47
<transcript>: I feel like I can't think or process anything.

02:51:51
<transcript>: Anna, thank you for that. Follow.

02:51:51
<transcript>: my tongue

02:51:58
<transcript>: My tongue feels like it's heady and it's hard to talk. Just everything about coming off. Caffeine is the worst.

02:51:59
jenswoeste: why are you doing this to yourself?

02:52:03
<transcript>: Caffeine is just a fatigue suppressant. I think so. That sounds right.

02:52:03
<transcript>: still a lot of

02:52:11
<transcript>: Still a lot of ways to build an Android app. Compose is formalizing. It a bit more, I reckon agree. Webdev is very different.

02:52:20
<transcript>: Just bought 20 liters of mate tea, lemonade, 100 milligrams caffeine per bottle for my Masters. Okay, 100 milligrams. That's like a cup of coffee. Right.

02:52:24
elliot0x01: Literally eating a pizza and enjoying the stream :) not so healthy  for dinner I guess :|

02:52:30
<transcript>: Feel like it has a placebo effect. It might. But, man, I don't know. That first day with caffeine when you haven't had it in a while.

02:52:30
<transcript>: there's nothing placebo
