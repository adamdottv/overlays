00:11:57
<transcript>: How's that.

00:12:03
nexxeln: nice

00:12:05
<transcript>: So I think I had caffeine. Well, I know I have caffeine. I had caffeine on my vacation.

00:12:05
<transcript>: i think

00:12:11
<transcript>: I think I had more caffeine than I realized. I wasn't exactly sure how much caffeine I had.

00:12:11
<transcript>: you know how like nothing

00:12:25
<transcript>: You know how, like nothing ever. It doesn't actually tell you how much caffeine's, anything. So I had some coffee because there's vacation. I said, you know what? I'm having coffee. But to day, I'm feeling it. I'm feeling that I didn't have cavien this morning.

00:12:25
<transcript>: and

00:12:26
<transcript>: And.

00:12:26
<transcript>: i'm also

00:12:32
<transcript>: I'm also feeling I'm feeling a lot of things, but I missed everyone here, so I had to stream today.

00:12:32
<transcript>: against

00:12:34
<transcript>: Against my better judgment.

00:12:39
<transcript>: Good morning, Leighton. I'm back. How was a vacation? It was fantastic, actually.

00:12:39
<transcript>: meant i

00:12:44
sandro_vol: Okay stream lags so bad I think my internet is broken :D

00:12:44
<transcript>: Meant I built a towel from how groggy I look, but I'm feeling very well rested.

00:12:48
<transcript>: I got like so I use this app.

00:12:48
<transcript>: that tracks

00:12:51
cowfacedude99: @sandro_vol me too

00:12:51
<transcript>: That tracks my sleep? It's called rise.

00:12:54
<transcript>: And I think I was like.

00:12:54
jobnbackpack: Hey adam, wb!

00:13:01
<transcript>: Streamlike so bad I think my internet is broken I know it could be me it could definitely be on my side.

00:13:07
stroopwafel26: hellooooo

00:13:13
<transcript>: So I use this app. It tracks my sleep debt. Rise, sleep thing called Rise and I was operating at like 10 hours of sleep debt for the last couple months, mostly consistently.

00:13:13
<transcript>: and

00:13:16
jaystation3x: I laugh every time my phone shows "OMG ADAM IS STREAMING"

00:13:19
<transcript>: And I'm at zero now I have no sleep debt. I even have some sleep equity. I slept more than I needed to.

00:13:19
<transcript>: and

00:13:21
<transcript>: And.

00:13:21
<transcript>: that makes

00:13:23
<transcript>: That makes it harder, actually.

00:13:26
<transcript>: And you just want to keep sleeping.

00:13:36
jobnbackpack: yeah prob on adams side bc i have the lags too

00:13:36
<transcript>: Okay, so cast out. It was great. Vacation was fantastic. Hey, Nextle, we're working on T three SEC today. If I can figure out how to use your computer again.

00:13:36
<transcript>: he's saying

00:13:38
<transcript>: He's saying, Ro.

00:13:40
<transcript>: rod

00:13:41
<transcript>: Rod.

00:13:51
<transcript>: Who else is here? Job is here. Hey, Job, thank you for the welcome back. Stroop is here. Hello? Shrup. Nj's here. I laugh every time my phone shows.

00:13:55
stream_kyle: Hola

00:13:59
<transcript>: I don't know where that shows up. It just says, like you can change the notification text. I thought that sounds good.

00:14:03
<transcript>: Probably on Adam side, because I had the lags. Oh, no.

00:14:08
<transcript>: Kyle's here. Do we have that was not. Oh, no. For Kyle.

00:14:08
<transcript>: that was oh no

00:14:12
<transcript>: you have

00:14:14
<transcript>: You have the lags too.

00:14:14
<transcript>: we have

00:14:14
stream_kyle: haha

00:14:18
laytanl_: stream is pulling 2mb/s so that might cause the lag

00:14:19
<transcript>: We have lacks on my street. I mean, it makes sense. I feel pretty laggy at the moment.

00:14:27
<transcript>: Makes sense that my stream would stream is pulling two megabits a second so that might cause the lag.

00:14:29
stroopwafel26: Hope you had a great weekend @adamdotdev

00:14:31
sandro_vol: ü•Å

00:14:32
<transcript>: How many megabits a second isn't normally full.

00:14:32

00:14:50
<transcript>: What is too megabits a second latent. I'm not Lagging. Okay, that's good.

00:14:56
<transcript>: Yes, this is it's doing it. Oh, I had dropped from.

00:15:02
<transcript>: Dropped frames. Oh, Geez, what's that mean? Why am I dropping frames.

00:15:02
<transcript>: is it because

00:15:04
<transcript>: Is it because of the.

00:15:04
<transcript>: maco

00:15:13
<transcript>: Macos update. I did update Mac OS, and then I went on vacation. So we're gonna learn all kinds of things that don't work in the new Mac OS beta.

00:15:17
<transcript>: I dropped 172 frames.

00:15:22
<transcript>: But I'm sending.

00:15:22

00:15:30
<transcript>: A very good day to you Yuns, how are you.

00:15:44
<transcript>: So found me, I guess. Adam Dev. I didn't know how much of a thing that would be like, how difficult will it be to find me with the new username? Does it even matter? Do you just get a notification? You click on the pin.

00:15:44
<transcript>: and that

00:15:46
<transcript>: And that was it.

00:15:51
<transcript>: I guess that's how it works. You're all back. Y'all found me.

00:15:53
jenswoeste: as a follower it went automagically

00:15:53
nexxeln: you're still in followed channels so...

00:15:57
<transcript>: Abdul My Daw files.

00:15:57
<transcript>: i'm still

00:16:05
uberrick: Heyy

00:16:06
<transcript>: I'm still in followed channels. Yeah, that makes sense. So there's not really anything. You just have a moment where Adam Dev? And why am I following them? There? I got.

00:16:14
<transcript>: Oh, yeah, everyone's history. Hey, Rick, Rick is here.

00:16:14
<transcript>: let's

00:16:17
<transcript>: Let's see here. I want to.

00:16:21
<transcript>: There's something I was gonna do.

00:16:31
<transcript>: Oh, I'm just gonna be slow today we'll see how long I make it on the stream? My brain is not in work on computer mode.

00:16:31
<transcript>: it's

00:16:33
<transcript>: It's in.

00:16:33
<transcript>: hang out in

00:16:35

<transcript>: But it was good. It's good vacation. It was just like five days.

00:16:40
<transcript>: it's not like

<transcript>: what

00:16:51
adamdotdev: !dotfiles

00:16:57
uberrick: !github

00:16:59
<transcript>: What happens when you do file so we even have a dot file command. I'm gonna do this right now because I finally updated them. I might as well have the command.

00:17:05
<transcript>: What I use for commands. Github that should work.

00:17:05
<transcript>: does that work

00:17:06
<transcript>: Does that work.

00:17:12
<transcript>: What is the thing? I use Fafa bot. That's right. Saucebot.

00:17:14
kylliangamer: adam live on a wednesday?! :o

00:17:22
<transcript>: Camera, David. Okay, GitHub. That's my neo vim config. We're gonna actually change that.

00:17:22
<transcript>: to

<transcript>: To be.

00:17:27
<transcript>: Adam files.

00:17:40
<transcript>: create

00:17:42
<transcript>: Create okay.

00:17:49
<transcript>: So apparently none of my commands are working. Oh, I may have to, like, tell Fossil Bot I changed my username.

00:17:49
<transcript>: that could

00:17:51
<transcript>: That could be.

00:17:51
<transcript>: that could

00:17:53
<transcript>: That could be.

00:17:53
<transcript>: dashboard

00:17:53

<transcript>: special

00:18:03
<transcript>: Special. Wednesday. Yeah, yeah, everything's different now, Kylien. I'm live on Wednesday.

00:18:03
<transcript>: because

00:18:10
<transcript>: Because I just got back from vacation, and I kind of wanted to jump on today, so I don't normally see one Wednesdays.

00:18:13
<transcript>: So that's new I'm streaming on a Wednesday.

00:18:13

<transcript>: She saw the intro. You'll know exactly what I'm talking about.

00:18:31
<transcript>: Let's see. I need to. I guess I'll just do it. I'm gonna jump over to my screen. You guys can learn how to use computer with me.

00:18:34
stroopwafel26: google "how to computer", you'll figure it out

00:18:35
<transcript>: And then we'll start writing some.

00:18:35
<transcript>: some code

00:18:36
<transcript>: Some code here shortly.

00:18:43
uberrick: haha I've been on holiday for a week and been easing myself back in

<transcript>: raid hype

00:20:02
<transcript>: Raid Hype. Oh, what was that noise? That meant something. I don't know. What? That? I don't remember any of my notification sounds. What was that.

00:20:06
<transcript>: You had a month off earlier this year.

00:20:06
<transcript>: wow

00:20:10
<transcript>: Wow. You had to relearn Neil them. I'm sure I'd have to relearn everything.

<transcript>: At that point. Yeah. Next one sauce about Dev is a really cool guy.

00:20:14

00:20:16
<transcript>: me and ayden

00:20:21
kylliangamer: that was me subbing :p

00:20:24
<transcript>: Me and Ayden. I know who he is. He doesn't know I am, but I know who Aiden is. He might know who I am. We're in some channels in disc board together.

00:20:32
kylliangamer: idk why it didn't appear in chat, sadge

00:20:32
<transcript>: So, Rick, is it like a special holiday week? Is this like, did I choose a good week to have.

00:20:32
<transcript>: a week off

00:20:33
<transcript>: A week off.

00:20:33
<transcript>: feels like

00:20:38
<transcript>: Feels like there's a lot of people that were on holiday. Is there something I didn't know about.

00:20:42
<transcript>: September doesn't seem like a big holiday month.

00:20:47
<transcript>: I can't imagine Laden a month off. Thank you for the following Nona.

00:20:53
dendenguy: What's awguess?

00:20:58
<transcript>: Was you Southern Killian. Thank you so much for this up. How I just had not see it in my notifications.

00:20:58
<transcript>: what's

00:21:03
<transcript>: What's a to you guess so. Aw, guess let's pull this up. Let's do this.

00:21:07
<transcript>: What's? That thing? I use? Gallidro. Yeah.

00:21:09
uberrick: haha well in the UK the schools all go back at the start of Sept after a 6 week summer holiday period

00:21:10
<transcript>: Let's see here.

00:21:10
<transcript>: i made a little

00:21:11
stroopwafel26: a month off sounds great right now

00:21:11
<transcript>: I made a little diagram.

00:21:11
<transcript>: aw

00:21:15
<transcript>: Aw, guess is going to be a game where.

00:21:15
<transcript>: you

00:21:17
<transcript>: You.

00:21:17
<transcript>: see an

00:21:26
uberrick: Usually cheaper holidays outside of peak holiday season

00:21:32
<transcript>: See an AWS service icon. You know how there's, like, if you're familiar with AWS, there's, like, 300 plus services. And I don't know that there's 300 plus. Last I knew there's like 250 plus, but I just assume it keeps going out. So just always I keep moving the number up things like 300.

00:21:32
<transcript>: so you see

00:21:39
laytanl_: haha I used up most of my vacation days though

00:21:50
<transcript>: So you see, like one of their icons there's, like these service icons for every AWS service. And you have to pick what one it is. Do you have four choices? Then you have to do it against someone. Simulate time. There's gonna be a lot of pressure, and they're gonna be a leaderboard. It's basically just a full stack app that I want to build.

00:21:50
<transcript>: to learn

00:21:55
<transcript>: To learn T three SEC. I've never played with T three sacks. Specifically, I've never played with the RPC.

00:21:59
<transcript>: I don't usually use SQL database so Prism is new to me as well.

00:22:05
dendenguy: Ah that's cool

00:22:07
<transcript>: A month off does sound great. I don't know when you get back from vacation, it just kind of feels like maybe I just want to stay on vacation.

00:22:07
<transcript>: permanently

00:22:07
stream_kyle: I used to watch this guy on YouTube who seemed to take a two or three week vacation nearly every month. It became a meme even among the other guys he made videos with.

00:22:08
<transcript>: Permanently.

00:22:12
<transcript>: Gsg thank you for the follow. Thank you so much.

00:22:20
<transcript>: It didn't appear in Chat, Gillian. It didn't appear in my notifications. I just heard the noise.

00:22:32
<transcript>: In the UK, the schools all go back at the start September after six weeks. I'm summer holiday period. Okay. So that was why you kind of sort of took the kind of sort of that's why you took the time off because school is starting back up.

00:22:32
<transcript>: usually

00:22:35
stroopwafel26: doesn't using neovim feel like a permanent vacation MaxLOL

00:22:35
<transcript>: Usually cheaper holidays. That's a Peacock does that make sense.

00:22:35
<transcript>: use

00:22:55
<transcript>: Use that most notification days. I would say so late. And after a month, at least in the US, I don't think you get any more vacation days. I don't think these people in the US expect you to take them off. All the startups here have unlimited PTO, but it's like wink, wink, unlimited. Like if you take off anytime at all, we're gonna judge you that's that's not fair. That's not true. But something like that.

00:23:05
<transcript>: You Swatch this guy on YouTube, who streamed or seemed to take a two or three week vacation nearly every month. If you came to meme, that's awesome.

00:23:18
<transcript>: Yeah. So we're gonna build AW. Guess we started on Thursday to Friday. I don't remember anymore because I took vacation. We started on AW, guess.

00:23:23
<transcript>: All I remember is we bought the domains. So we own all the domains. That's good.

00:23:25
<transcript>: I don't remember much else.

00:23:25
<transcript>: we're

00:23:31
<transcript>: We're learning lots of things all at once. That's what I remember. But right now, I just got to figure out why.

00:23:31
<transcript>: why

00:23:32
<transcript>: Why.

00:23:36
<transcript>: Is fossil bot not working, is it working now.

00:23:38
adamdotdev: !github

00:23:39
<transcript>: Is it working? Let's see. Get hurt.

00:23:45
<transcript>: So I have to, like, invite it to chat or something or give it permission.

00:23:49
<transcript>: Part channel.

00:23:52
<transcript>: Added files. Let's see.

00:23:58
stroopwafel26: wait what happened to the verge, the new site design is... interesting

00:23:59
<transcript>: Anybody know anybody ever had this issue where you rename your username on Twitch, and now nothing works.

00:24:13
<transcript>: Managing channel Adam Dev. That's me no push TV item over that's wrong.

00:24:13
<transcript>: see

00:24:15
<transcript>: See that's wrong? Right there.

00:24:15
<transcript>: feel like i need

00:24:20
<transcript>: Feel like I need to tell it that is not the username anymore. Let's see. Where is that.

00:24:20
carlosgn: adam i have a serious question, i have problems managing stress and every time i get stressed, i feel like i don't enjoy my job and need something else. have you ever experience this?

00:24:22
<transcript>: Ayden help.

00:24:22
<transcript>: and

00:24:24
<transcript>: And.

00:24:27
<transcript>: Vanity settings.

00:24:29
<transcript>: Settings.

00:24:29
<transcript>: maybe

00:24:30
<transcript>: Maybe.

00:24:32
riftedd: fan out dbs

00:24:49
<transcript>: Carlos. Serious question. Okay, hang on.

00:24:53
dendenguy: Try logging in again with twitch

00:24:55
<transcript>: How do I sleep? Atomize for these serious questions.

00:25:01
<transcript>: And stretch a little bit? Oh, I'm still coming to still waking up.

00:25:01
<transcript>: okay

00:25:03
<transcript>: Okay, serious question.

00:25:21
<transcript>: Managers have problems managing shows. Every time I get stressed, I feel like I don't enjoy my job. I need something else. Have you ever experienced this? Yes. Is this what you call burnout? I don't know. Sometimes the definition of burnout is a little fuzzy to me. I think this is what you call burnout. Thank you so much for the follow warning.

00:25:25
<transcript>: So I think.

00:25:32
<transcript>: I think this is called Burnout. I'm gonna come over here because there's a cowboy hat on me, and it's not working too well with my overlay.

00:25:32
<transcript>: not sure what that

00:25:36
<transcript>: Not sure what that's about? It's not a green Catboy hat.

00:25:41
<transcript>: So burnout. I think this is what you'd call burnout.

00:25:41
<transcript>: the way

00:25:45
<transcript>: The way I've managed to burn out in the past is.

00:25:45
<transcript>: wow this

00:25:49
<transcript>: Wow. This is this is coming from a place of privilege. Okay.

00:25:49
<transcript>: scarf robce

00:25:51
<transcript>: Scarf. Robce. Where.

00:25:59
<transcript>: I'm able to do this on occasion. I just do less. And maybe your job. You can just do less. Maybe.

00:26:02
<transcript>: But I don't know if that's dealing with it.

00:26:02
<transcript>: so much

00:26:05
<transcript>: So much is just succumbing to it.

00:26:05
<transcript>: like

00:26:11
<transcript>: Like when I start feeling like I just don't want to do stuff. I'm just tired of doing stuff.

00:26:11
<transcript>: i just

00:26:13
<transcript>: I just don't do stuff.

00:26:17
<transcript>: And I'm sure like, there's a lot of jobs we can get away with that.

00:26:22
<transcript>: And I don't know maybe that's wrong? Maybe shouldn't.

00:26:22
<transcript>: but i just

00:26:25
<transcript>: But I just feel like that's human. I feel like that's just.

00:26:25
<transcript>: like people

00:26:29
<transcript>: Like people hire you. They hire a human. And the reality is.

00:26:29
<transcript>: that

00:26:46
<transcript>: That you're not gonna you're gonna have periods of lower activity in periods of higher activity, peak activity and low activity, like, throughout the year. For me, I felt like for a while, it was quarterly, like, every three months, I felt like I go really hard on stuff. So I like, go.

00:26:46
<transcript>: way

00:27:03
carlosgn: hahaha it feel really wrong to work on something that i don't love, it deemotivates me a loot..

00:27:03
<transcript>: Way into things. I get very invested. Usually it lasts a few months and then I sort of get very burnt out and I have a few months where I'm just doing a lot less. It's not like I don't work at all because I'd go crazy. If I didn't come into my office and get some time, sort of working on stuff.

00:27:03
<transcript>: but

00:27:08
<transcript>: But I just maybe do less than normal because I don't.

00:27:12
jaystation3x: See also, "quiet quitting."

00:27:19
<transcript>: Feel really wrong to work on something that I don't love. It motivates me a lot. Yeah. So, I mean, are you a you're in software? Quiet. Quitting. Oh, Jay, there's a term for it. Okay.

00:27:21
stroopwafel26: Back when I experienced burnout I talked to a psychologist, called in sick and did nothing for 3 months

00:27:24
<transcript>: There's a term for this phenomenon. I'm just driving.

00:27:32
<transcript>: Call in sick and did nothing. Did nothing for three months. That sounds about what? Yeah, that's what I do. Basically. Stroop. I don't call into sickness, necessarily.

00:27:40
carlosgn: I work for a startup so there's no "do less" haha

00:27:40
<transcript>: I don't know who I'd call at this point. I don't have a person to call in sick, too, if my wife.

00:27:50
<transcript>: There's no do left EA startups are a little harder. You can't really like hide in a startup again at a big company.

00:28:04
carlosgn: Yes!

00:28:06
<transcript>: Yeah. If you were for a startup that you're sure you enjoy this work, there are periods where you're very into it. Is that the case, Carlos? You're not just in the wrong career, are you? I guess what I'm asking. Making sure like.

00:28:10
<transcript>: Yes. Okay. She do love it. It's just go through people.

00:28:10
<transcript>: i think

00:28:12
<transcript>: I think that's what they call it.

00:28:15
carlosgn: i don't think so no

00:28:19
<transcript>: Yeah, no, I think that's pretty common. I'm sure you could find if you just search Brown out and quiet quitting.

00:28:24
<transcript>: You don't think so? No. Oh, no. I don't know which thing that was.

00:28:24
<transcript>: in response to

00:28:25
<transcript>: In response to.

00:28:25
<transcript>: you don't

00:28:28
<transcript>: You don't think so? No.

00:28:34
<transcript>: Oh, you're. You don't think you're in the wrong career. Yeah. Yeah. So you do love it. You just.

00:28:34
<transcript>: sometimes

00:28:36
<transcript>: Sometimes you need some time.

00:28:38
<transcript>: To.

00:28:49
<transcript>: To get back into it and be excited about it again. Yeah. I'd look up Burnout and how people deal with that. I've seen all kinds of people post Twitter's, Reds and YouTube videos and whatever about burnout.

00:28:49
<transcript>: so i feel like there's

00:28:52
<transcript>: So I feel like there's probably a lot of resources out there.

00:28:55
<transcript>: Okay.

00:28:55
<transcript>: so

00:28:56
<transcript>: So.

00:28:56
<transcript>: trying to figure

00:28:57
jaystation3x: It takes a little time sometimes.

00:28:58
<transcript>: Trying to figure out.

00:28:58
<transcript>: how to figure out

00:28:59
<transcript>: How to figure out.

00:28:59
<transcript>: one why

00:29:02
<transcript>: One Why does my cowboy hat.

00:29:09
<transcript>: Not work with the green screen. That's weird. It doesn't make any sense. Kind of makes me a traffic outway hat, though.

00:29:15
carlosgn: Thanks :)

00:29:17
riftedd: probably need to balance with other hobbies/interests. when i hyperfocus on building/coding/interview prep i burn out fast.

00:29:17
<transcript>: Also trying to get this to work so fossil bot faucebot why don't you work.

00:29:24
<transcript>: Why don't you work? How do I? Somebody said log back out and log in.

00:29:24
<transcript>: so we log out

00:29:27
<transcript>: So we log out of here? Oh, yeah, yeah? Log out.

00:29:27
<transcript>: i saw that earlier

00:29:27
stroopwafel26: @adamdotdev maybe reconnect twitch to fossabot

00:29:28
jenswoeste: im a startup founder and I did have a severe burnout at one point (literally finding myself in the fetal position in a corner of my office). Been consulting a therapist ever since. The worst part was loss of cognitive skills. Took 6 months to be back to "normal".

00:29:29
<transcript>: I saw that earlier. Okay, log in with Twitch.

00:29:32
<transcript>: Authorize.

00:29:34
<transcript>: Adam Dev.

00:29:37
<transcript>: Does it work now.

00:29:37
<transcript>: did that do it

00:29:38
<transcript>: Did that do it.

00:29:44
adamdotdev: !github

00:29:45
<transcript>: Maybe reconnect twist spot. Yeah, I'll see this one. Github.

00:29:55
<transcript>: Probably need to balance.

00:30:10
<transcript>: With other hobbies interests. When I hyper focus on building coding, interview prep, I burn out fast. Yeah. No, I definitely know balance is supposed to be healthy. I'm not great at it, but I hear that that's helpful for.

00:30:12
<transcript>: General Career happiness.

00:30:12
<transcript>: i

00:30:18
<transcript>: I do have some hobbies now I got into mechanical keyboards for a bit. I enjoy them.

00:30:22
<transcript>: What Else do I enjoy? Enjoy. Legos.

00:30:26
<transcript>: Particularly building them with my son.

00:30:28
<transcript>: Mic. So far over.

00:30:33
<transcript>: Sorry it's gonna sound bad. Or maybe great. I don't know.

00:30:33
<transcript>: hey some more

00:30:34
<transcript>: Hey, some more.

00:30:41
jenswoeste: I view things like stress and burnout just like I would view any physical injury - they are not visible but have to be taken equally serious.

00:30:43
<transcript>: No, I definitely didn't sound great. I'm sorry I apologize, but thanks for the follow anyway, sight too.

00:31:03
<transcript>: I'm a Signup founder. I did have a severe burnout one point, literally finding my stuff in the field position in a corner of my office. That's not awful. Been consulting if they're visor with loss of cognitive skills, just wants to go back to normal. Yeah, burnout is serious. And I will say, Sarah, this is fantastic. Camera over here.

00:31:10
<transcript>: So I've definitely seen a therapist in the last couple years, something I just never thought to do first.

00:31:10
<transcript>: decade of my

00:31:11
<transcript>: Decade of my career.

00:31:11
<transcript>: but

00:31:24
<transcript>: But it's helped tremendously in a lot of areas alive. So I'm very much recommend that I view things like stress and burnout, just like I would view any physical injury not visible that had to be taken. Yeah. No. Exactly.

00:31:34
<transcript>: Stress. Yeah. And anxiety. And a lot of anxiety, just like there's so much I want to do. There's so many things going on in technology. It's just a very fast paced, world.

00:31:34
<transcript>: i definitely

00:31:36
<transcript>: I definitely get like.

00:31:41
<transcript>: Just generally have an underlying anxiety about everything in work.

00:31:49
<transcript>: And right now I have some anxiety over this faucet bot not connecting.

00:31:52
<transcript>: Like. I want to have commands.

00:32:00
<transcript>: But at some point I just invested enough. I guess maybe I need to go to my Twitch.

00:32:00
<transcript>: settings

00:32:07
<transcript>: Settings. Maybe it's here. My Twitch settings. Hang on. Account settings are like permissions or something. Security.

00:32:14
<transcript>: Connections.

00:32:21
<transcript>: Fauceabot? Are you in here.

00:32:25
<transcript>: Faustabot. There it is. Connected. It says, Connected. Okay.

00:32:36
<transcript>: Roles. Manager? What is this? Okay. Fossil moderator.

00:32:36
<transcript>: check

00:32:37
<transcript>: Check.

00:32:41
stroopwafel26: maybe remove it from twitch and re-add it

00:32:44
<transcript>: Well.

00:32:47
stream_kyle: In the roles page what happens if you click broadcaster?

00:32:50
<transcript>: I could fix that real quick, but maybe we should just get to building.

00:32:55
<transcript>: In the Rolls Page What Happens if you click broadcaster.

00:32:57
stream_kyle: On the Fossabot page

00:32:58
<transcript>: Remove it from Twitch and re add it.

00:32:58
<transcript>: we can do that

00:32:59
<transcript>: We can do that.

00:33:02
<transcript>: On the fossil bot page, you're saying.

00:33:02
<transcript>: roll

00:33:09
<transcript>: Rolls. Page. What happens if you click Broadcast? You'll see Rolls. I saw that somewhere. Rolls.

00:33:09
<transcript>: broad

00:33:11
<transcript>: Broadcaster.

00:33:19
<transcript>: Administrator.

00:33:22
<transcript>: Is all that's checked.

00:33:25
<transcript>: Founder, Moderator, VIP.

00:33:32
<transcript>: Yeah, I don't know.

00:33:34
<transcript>: Until.

00:33:37
<transcript>: Maybe I'll.

00:33:41
riftedd: i have done some frontend work on the side tho i mainly work backend for work. It seems that at some point frontend type stuff becomes adding new buttons/dialogs/forms and ways for user to interact. it felt repetitive at some point. am i doing frontend wrong? I'm sure it has its own complex design problems too right

00:33:42
<transcript>: Maybe I'll Ping Ayden would that be super annoying.

00:33:42
<transcript>: for me to ping a

00:33:44
<transcript>: For me to Ping Aiden and say, Hey.

00:33:47
<transcript>: It's broke.

00:33:47
<transcript>: i broke it

00:33:48
<transcript>: I broke it.

00:33:51
<transcript>: When I mean people change their.

00:33:51
<transcript>: their twitch

00:33:54
<transcript>: Their Twitch username. Is that common.

00:33:55
stroopwafel26: I think the connection between fossabot and twitch is broken and needs to be established again

00:33:58
<transcript>: Work on the side.

00:34:11
<transcript>: Mainly working back in for work. Seems that at some point print and type stuff becomes adding new buttons, dialog, forms and ways for users interact repetitive. At some point am I doing front and wrong? Sure it has its own complex.

00:34:11
<transcript>: yeah

00:34:14
<transcript>: Yeah. I okay. Let's talk about frontend.

00:34:14
<transcript>: let's do

00:34:17
<transcript>: Let's do it. I got to deal with it. Thing on.

00:34:17
<transcript>: appro

00:34:18
<transcript>: Appropriate.

00:34:29
<transcript>: Front end kind of wears me out. It just wears me out. There's so much going on in the front end space. And I guess, like.

00:34:29
<transcript>: it makes sense

00:34:30
<transcript>: It makes sense.

00:34:30
<transcript>: it's

00:34:35
<transcript>: It's where like you users touch your thing.

00:34:39
<transcript>: It's like the front end is.

00:34:39
<transcript>: the surface area

00:34:42
shn4ke: I don't think Aiden would mind he likes to help if there is any issues with fossabot

00:34:49
<transcript>: The surface area of your app. It's the place. I mean, if you're building something with the front end, I guess so. I guess it makes sense. And it's incredibly complex.

00:34:49
<transcript>: the amount of things

00:34:50
<transcript>: The amount of things.

00:34:50
<transcript>: people that

00:34:54
<transcript>: People that nerd out on front end know about.

00:34:57
<transcript>: And I feel like.

00:34:57
<transcript>: the back

00:34:59
<transcript>: The back end should be that complicated.

00:34:59
<transcript>: i mean it seems

00:35:05
<transcript>: I mean, it seems important the back end kind of seeing, the more important. You know what I mean? I don't mean to be like.

00:35:07
fall1nn: omg thats amazing definition of UI kind of work )))

00:35:07
<transcript>: Layers.

00:35:07
<transcript>: what's

00:35:10
<transcript>: What's the like.

00:35:10
<transcript>: i don't mean to

00:35:13
yeltrah_: Not sure I like user's touching my thing

00:35:23
fall1nn: if u want to users would touch ur things )))

00:35:25
kauai_life: endsist

00:35:27
<transcript>: I don't mean to say I'm not pitting them against each other. Like back ends better. But generally I think we think of the back end being the more important thing to our business. Right. And then, like, front ends. Oh, yeah. You just build a front end for it. Like you might have multiple front ends. You have a native web app or a native mobile app, and you have a web app.

00:35:27
<transcript>: but

00:35:30
<transcript>: But like the front end is so complex.

00:35:34
<transcript>: I don't know if it needs to be, but it is.

00:35:40
<transcript>: And like State Management, that stuff just hurts my brain.

00:35:40
<transcript>: how many different

00:35:41
<transcript>: How many different ways.

00:35:41
<transcript>: we've

00:35:47
m3talstorm: Backends are more complicate, frontend just has more choices

00:35:47
<transcript>: We've come up with building front ends and the whole like MPA versus Spa debate and.

00:35:47
<transcript>: then you get

00:36:01
<transcript>: Then you get into, like, the nittygritty of, like, how reactive things and virtual Dons and timeflicing and all this crazy stuff. And I'm like, I don't know. Does it need to be this complicated? I think it's maybe it's too complicated.

00:36:04
<transcript>: That could just be because I'm a back in person as well.

00:36:04
<transcript>: and

00:36:05
m3talstorm: complicated*

00:36:06
<transcript>: And.

00:36:06
<transcript>: as

00:36:09
caldotjs: hello sir

00:36:13
jaystation3x: Front-end devs feel inadequate around back-end devs and back-end devs feel inadequate being unable to create the things that real people care about.

00:36:16
<transcript>: As a back end person who has to work on the front end, I do it begrudgingly and I'm just a little bitter. I think I'm just a little bitter about how complicated front end is.

00:36:16
stroopwafel26: @caldotjs is back!

00:36:17
fall1nn: creating UI means u need to communicate to users and thats most complicated thing ever

00:36:23
<transcript>: So, yeah, I'm right there with you? Rifted rifted.

00:36:28
<transcript>: It. I don't enjoy doing frontend work.

00:36:28
<transcript>: i

00:36:28
caldotjs: @stroopwafel26 hello stroop! how are you doing?

00:36:28
kauai_life: "I like the back end" - Adam 2022

00:36:31
<transcript>: I do it because I have to because I work alone.

00:36:39
<transcript>: Okay, so, schnik. Schneik. I will reach out to Aden. That's what we'll do.

00:36:44
<transcript>: It's amazing definition of you. I kind of work. Welcome to Chat. Fallen.

00:36:44
<transcript>: not sure

00:36:46
<transcript>: Not sure if I like.

00:36:47
stroopwafel26: @caldotjs great! thanks for asking, how are you today?

00:36:53
<transcript>: I knew as soon as I said, that one of those things you say, the words they come out of your mouth. And you're like.

00:36:53
<transcript>: yeah

00:36:56
<transcript>: Yeah, that wasn't the right choice, or.

00:36:59
<transcript>: If you want to users would touch your things.

00:36:59
princejoogie: what we doin today

00:37:02
<transcript>: And welcome to chat.

00:37:02
<transcript>: call

00:37:07
<transcript>: Call Kawhi Kawhi life. Do you live in Hawaii? Kawhi lies. It's a cool name.

00:37:09
<transcript>: In Z.

00:37:12
<transcript>: Front end, back end.

00:37:16
<transcript>: Back ends. Welcome. Also. Welcome to Chat now.

00:37:16
<transcript>: more

00:37:20
<transcript>: More complicated. Frontend just has more choices. Yeah, that makes sense.

00:37:20
<transcript>: i mean

00:37:24
caldotjs: @stroopwafel26 wonderful. great! bit stressed since I am going to finish my thesis till friday and there are 3/6 chapters left. need to hand in in 4 weeks

00:37:31
<transcript>: I mean, front end is pretty complicated, too, but I'm just not sure it has to be this complicated. I don't know. There's just a lot of, like stuff on Twitter right now. Going on a lot of debating, a lot of back and forth.

00:37:31
<transcript>: about how we should

00:37:37
<transcript>: About how we should build front end apps to make them the most performant. But did you think about people.

00:37:37
<transcript>: with slow

00:37:42
<transcript>: With Slow networks. Did you think about people with this and that and it.

00:37:42
<transcript>: 's

00:37:44
<transcript>: 's.

00:37:44
<transcript>: new light

00:37:49
<transcript>: New Lighthouse scores matter. Or is that just first load and then your thing is still slow.

00:37:49
<transcript>: there's so much

00:37:50
stroopwafel26: @caldotjs you got this! i'm rooting for you

00:37:59
<transcript>: There's so much debate going on, and I kind of feel like I wish it were just 20 years from now and all that were settled, and we don't have to think about it anymore or hear about it on Twitter.

00:38:11
<transcript>: Cal dots here. Hello, caldat frontendez feel inadequate around backendes and back in des feel inadequate being unable to create the things that really people care about. That's a very measured.

00:38:13
<transcript>: Assessment J.

00:38:13
<transcript>: i think

00:38:15
<transcript>: I think that's spoton.

00:38:17
<transcript>: And.

00:38:21
caldotjs: @stroopwafel26 I am pretty confident it will be a good grade. my supervisors said its more of an masters thesis :D

00:38:25
<transcript>: Except I don't know how the front ended Zioner Act with I don't know how in an adequate they feel they seem to feel good.

00:38:29
<transcript>: I'm so insists.

00:38:37
<transcript>: Creating UI means you need to communicate to users, and that's most complicated thing ever. Yeah. So I guess like.

00:38:37
<transcript>: user

00:38:41
<transcript>: User experience and all that stuff. It is very complicated.

00:38:41
<transcript>: i get it

00:38:48
stroopwafel26: @caldotjs I'm not surprised, you're super smart from what I've seen :)

00:38:51
<transcript>: I get it. I think the thing that's complicated about fun in, though, is not the thing that gets so much discourse. I think the thing that's complicated is like, yeah, delivery.

00:38:59
<transcript>: An interface to users that they're gonna intuitively know how to use and it's gonna work for their needs. That's the complex thing.

00:38:59
<transcript>: but the

00:39:03
<transcript>: But the thing we focus on spend so much time talking about is.

00:39:03
<transcript>: how many

00:39:11
caldotjs: *blushing* I am quite happy to finish this chapter tbh

00:39:13

00:39:13
<transcript>: like it's talked

00:39:19
<transcript>: Like it's talked about. And I don't know. Isn't that important? Maybe it is. Maybe it's so important. And I just don't get it.

00:39:30
<transcript>: I like the backend. Adam 2022. That's right. That's where I like to live. The backend. Great. Thanks for asking how you okay. You guys are just talking. Wonderful.

jobnbackpack: is it lagging? or is it my internet ^^

00:39:39
<transcript>: Oh, cow pots. Also stress. We've been talking about stress. Cow lot. So we've been talking about on this stream. We haven't done anything productive yet.

00:39:39
<transcript>: we've

00:39:44
<transcript>: We've mostly I mean, that's productive talking about our mental health. It's definitely productive.

00:39:46
<transcript>: Okay.

00:39:52
<transcript>: So I'm going to start up fish because I don't have.

00:39:52

<transcript>: We're gonna close this.

00:40:08
<transcript>: Everyone feels like an imposter. That's right, Jay. I think you're right.

00:40:11
caldotjs: what were your stress related insights? I actually like being stressed since I can just plow through a LOT of work if I am

00:40:11
jaystation3x: @jaystation3x We are all sus.

00:40:14
<transcript>: Is it laughing? I don't know. Is it job? I hear it might be lagging.

00:40:14
<transcript>: we did dro

00:40:16
stroopwafel26: hahah

00:40:16
<transcript>: We did drop some frames earlier.

00:40:21
fall1nn: when i started to use my PC i`ll have to wait 15mins to connect my dialup provider to see 1/4 part of the lady on my screen and now users doen't want to wait more than 3 seconds ))

00:40:22
<transcript>: That feels bad? We are all set.

00:40:29
<transcript>: I don't know if I should worry about this. I got a little nose whistle.

00:40:29
<transcript>: you hear

00:40:31
<transcript>: You hear that.

00:40:41
<transcript>: Is this still right? Building A to guess now. Topic. Yeah. I mean, it is, but not with DAX. Building.

00:40:41
<transcript>: aw

00:40:46
<transcript>: Aw guess with T three sac.

00:40:48
<transcript>: Also waking up.

stroopwafel26: @caldotjs hey, me too! I need stress and deadlines or I won't do anything at all

00:40:52
<transcript>: What.

00:40:55
<transcript>: I'm gonna log in what is going on.

00:41:02
<transcript>: This is why you don't change your username. Everybody just don't do it. It's not worth it. I'm that Div. And then.

00:41:03
nexxeln: i have to go now have a good stream! might come back later

00:41:04
<transcript>: Yes I gotta find my password.

00:41:12

00:41:14
<transcript>: Which.

00:41:14
<transcript>: we are gonna

00:41:18
<transcript>: We are gonna do something productive. I think soon.

00:41:23
caldotjs: @caldotjs I tend to gaslight myself into earlier due dates so I am stressed sooner and get the work done ahead of time :D

00:41:25
<transcript>: I mean, if you're here for that, if you're not, then I guess you found the right place this morning. We're just not being that productive.

00:41:32
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the follow philosophy is poison. I feel like that's.

00:41:33
stroopwafel26: great life hack

00:41:35
<transcript>: That's very fitting.

00:41:38
<transcript>: Your username at this moment.

00:41:45
<transcript>: I started dipping into some philosophy, probably. And maybe it's just poison. And I shouldn't.

00:41:45
<transcript>: or maybe

00:41:52
<transcript>: Or maybe that's just your username and I should just calm down. Thank you so much. A fizz Apes for the follow.

00:41:52
<transcript>: i'm trying to

00:41:54
<transcript>: I'm trying to find my Twitch password.

00:41:54
<transcript>: because

00:42:01
<transcript>: Because I have to log in copy password because I changed my username and broke everything.

00:42:14
riftedd: pixel world

00:42:34
<transcript>: Type in my password.

00:42:41
<transcript>: I'm talking so you can't hear the sound of each key and figure out reverse engineer my password.

00:42:41
<transcript>: think

00:42:46
<transcript>: Think that'd be a lot of work. I think if you did that, you probably deserve it. But.

00:42:49
<transcript>: I'm gonna have to put in a code.

00:42:49
<transcript>: because

00:42:50
riftedd: do you like split keyboards

00:42:51
<transcript>: Because two factor.

00:42:51
<transcript>: wow

00:42:57
<transcript>: Wow, it's 620 it's so late and I still feel like I just woke up.

00:43:02
<transcript>: Okay.

00:43:04
<transcript>: Submit.

00:43:08
adamdotdev: !topic building awguess with the t3 stack, also, waking up

00:43:08
<transcript>: We did it.

00:43:14
yeltrah_: 6:20am?

00:43:16
<transcript>: Okay. Did the topic work, I guess. Is the topic gonna work? Yes, it did work. Now let me get the password off my screen.

00:43:18
yeltrah_: That is late for you?

00:43:19
<transcript>: Let me get that closed.

00:43:19
<transcript>: and

00:43:21
<transcript>: And we can add fuzzy.

00:43:32
<transcript>: 620 Am. Yeah. Y'all try. I mean, like it's late in terms of my streaming schedule. Like normally I started late today. Normally we'd be.

00:43:32
<transcript>: i don't know an

00:43:45
<transcript>: I don't know. An hour and a half into the stream. At this point I would have accomplished something on the day, but I just got back from vacation, so I'm moving a little slow. It's a funny thing about sleep. I had been only sleeping.

00:43:45
<transcript>: six hours

00:44:01
jaystation3x: "Sleep begets sleep"

00:44:05
<transcript>: 6 hours a night for a long time. Like every time you see me stream, I've come off of like a six hour night and then I go on vacation. I sleep like 9 hours every night and I feel like I just want to keep sleeping. Why does sleep beget sleep? I don't understand it. I should be so well rested. I can sleep 3 hours and feel fine, but I can't. I want to sleep more.

00:44:05
<transcript>: i don't

00:44:08
yeltrah_: True story

00:44:09
<transcript>: I don't understand. It. Sleep. It gets sleep. That's right. J.

00:44:09
<transcript>: i don

00:44:14
<transcript>: I don't understand why, but it does do all split keyboards.

00:44:34
<transcript>: You know what? I don't aesthetically. They just bother me, but I ordered the Advantage 360 because I'm dumb and I'm a consumer, and prime is too cool, and I had to do it. I had to order it. Mostly it was the exclusivity. It was like, oh, their website is down. Oh, I'm definitely working it now. Like, I have to spam this page.

00:44:40
<transcript>: For hours until it finally loads. I'm here for it. That's the kind of thing I get into.

00:44:40
<transcript>: the guy that shows

00:44:41
yeltrah_: Oh man I want the Advantage 360 but it's only available in US

00:44:48
<transcript>: The guy that shows up really early. Stuff like to be in the front row at the concert. That's me. Like, oh, there's extra work involved. Yes, please.

00:44:54
<transcript>: Hi. I'm sorry. It's only the US. I feel like a jerk talking about it because.

00:44:54
<transcript>: i don't know

00:44:57
<transcript>: I don't know why it's one. I mean, they're a small team.

00:45:12
riftedd: 360 got me into it. but found a coiuple other good ones like dygma defy

00:45:17
<transcript>: I'm cutting them some slack, but it is a bummer that's only available in the US, and I don't even like the keyboards. I'm sorry. I'll learn to like it. I'm sure I'll love it. If it sounds good, if it doesn't sound good, I'm probably out, but it'll look nice on display. I guess maybe I could give it away or something. Oh, now that'd be a giveaway. My whole following is from Europe. So.

00:45:17
<transcript>: like all of

00:45:21
<transcript>: Like all of you with love to have an advantage 360 I could give it away.

00:45:21
<transcript>: i could do

00:45:23
<transcript>: I could do a giveaway.

00:45:27
yeltrah_: Will you have a keyboard cam?

00:45:29
caldotjs: a friend of mine recently coded a solution for an e commerce store, which makes the shop lag and seem like people are slowing it down due to many requests on release day

00:45:30
<transcript>: Just for you all we'll see if I don't like it that's terrible. I'll give you something if I don't like.

00:45:30
<transcript>: okay

00:45:30
yeltrah_: So I can drool over it

00:45:31
<transcript>: Okay.

00:46:36
<transcript>: All right.

00:46:38
bigdiff___: @fall1nn why would you Kappa Kappa

00:46:44
<transcript>: Playing music long time no see? Big Diff? Welcome back I just got back from vacation so welcome back to me and to you.

00:46:53
riftedd: password is leaked for sure

00:46:54
fall1nn: just asking )))

00:46:54
<transcript>: Welcome, welcome back. Can I just rewind the vid? Yes. Somebody tell me if I leaked my Twitch password. That's a bummer. If I did, you won't have my two factor. But you'll have my password. That sounds bad.

00:46:54
<transcript>: will

00:46:58
<transcript>: Will I have a keyboard Cam? I already have a keyboard Cam.

00:47:06
<transcript>: Yellow. I just don't show it. I don't show my keyboard Cam. It's. It's right here. There it is. There's my keyboard.

00:47:09

<transcript>: Alright, password is leaked awesome.

00:47:17
<transcript>: I was hoping it was leaked.

00:47:17
<transcript>: i can't

00:47:21
<transcript>: I can't do this if you want to see my keyboard sometimes like.

00:47:23
<transcript>: There's my keyboard, Cam.

00:47:23
<transcript>: and

00:47:26
<transcript>: And on's here, Hello? And.

yeltrah_: <--- hartjean btw

00:47:42
<transcript>: A friend of mine recently coded a solution for an ecommerce store, which makes the shop lag and seem like people are slowing it down due to miner requests on release day. You know.

00:47:42
<transcript>: that

00:47:47
<transcript>: That bums me out about the Advantage 360 like.

00:47:47
<transcript>: that day

00:47:57
<transcript>: That day that I bought one. It was so, so slow. Oh, heart, gene Yeltra is heartbean. You changed your username, too. Okay, okay.

00:48:00
<transcript>: We're names here buddies.

00:48:03
<transcript>: So.

<transcript>: Yeah, I guess.

00:48:05
<transcript>: it bums

00:48:08
<transcript>: It bums me out for the Kinesis team like.

00:48:08
<transcript>: eco

00:48:11
<transcript>: Ecommerce seems so solved.

00:48:12
yeltrah_: HeyGuys HeyGuys

00:48:24
<transcript>: And to think that like there's still shops. They're selling stuff online, and their site goes down when they get a lot of traffic that bums me out. I just feel like I want to help them. I'm sure they have plenty of people offering to help them because their keyboards are great.

00:48:31
caldotjs: maybe they also did it on purpose :>

00:48:32
<transcript>: It just seems like we should have a good site for Kinesis. They should have a solid website where traffic isn't gonna take it down, you know.

00:48:42
<transcript>: Maybe they did on purpose. Maybe it got me to buy one. That's a good point. It was the demand. That's what? That's what got me in.

00:48:42
<transcript>: alright

00:48:45
<transcript>: Alright. We're gonna do stuff now. Let's see here.

00:48:49
<transcript>: We're gonna minimize that eight of you guess. Let's build it.

00:48:49
<transcript>: let's

00:48:51
<transcript>: Let's do it.

00:48:54
<transcript>: First.

00:48:56
<transcript>: Let's do this.

00:48:57
fall1nn: love my keyboard more than my junior kid ))))

00:48:59
caldotjs: the e-commerce store I talked about requested it to test it as conversion rate optimization measure.

00:48:59
<transcript>: So tmux.

00:49:01
<transcript>: Tmax.

00:49:01
<transcript>: we're gonna

00:49:15
<transcript>: let's just do it

00:49:24
<transcript>: Let's just do it. Let's see the code. Playground. I think. Aw, guess I don't know why I put it in playground. It's a real thing.

00:49:30

<transcript>: Default arrow looks like it's pregnant.

00:49:46
<transcript>: that

00:49:50
<transcript>: That Green Arrow looks kind of sloppy. I don't know.

00:49:50
<transcript>: needs to tighten

00:49:57
<transcript>: Needs to tighten up a little bit or maybe just not be an arrow. I don't know if I like an arrow. Just give me a little bit of anxiety. Like what's? Pointing at.

00:50:01
phpeepee: that arrow is thiccc

00:50:08
caldotjs: have you ever played around with fish shell? imo its way above zsh

00:50:09
stroopwafel26: that's why I use pure prompt, doesn't have pregnant arrows

00:50:11
<transcript>: So let's open up another tmux window window or tmux paint. Now what do they? There's so many things in Dmux there's windows and panes and splits and whatever.

00:50:11
<transcript>: i want

00:50:13
<transcript>: I want to open another.

<transcript>: Yeah.

00:50:26
<transcript>: We'll rename this one to be like.

00:50:28
<transcript>: Cli or something.

<transcript>: let's

00:50:33
<transcript>: Let's.

00:50:33
<transcript>: vertical

00:50:34
<transcript>: Vertical split it.

00:50:37
<transcript>: And we'll do.

00:50:43
<transcript>: A to B guess let's go ahead and do yarn our PMPM renbiv.

00:50:46
<transcript>: No.

<transcript>: Next. I would know. Next one. Should I use TRPC ten. Where is it? Still early.

00:53:44
shn4ke: still half baked

00:53:52
<transcript>: Still have baked. Okay. Thank you so much. Snake.

00:53:52
<transcript>: i appreciate

00:53:54
<transcript>: I appreciate that.

00:54:06
stroopwafel26: the official tmux docs goes into the difference between sessions and panes etc, pretty good to get a handle on that first

00:54:14
<transcript>: I think this is an app. Once we figure out what the like experience of it should be like, how does the gameplay work and everything? I think once we have it all built in a front end for it, I want to build the backend in, like, five different technologies. This is I'm gonna use this project as my benchmark project. We're gonna see, like, what are the best ways to build a back end in 2020.

00:54:14
<transcript>: two

00:54:17
<transcript>: Two that sounds like a clickbaity title.

00:54:32
<transcript>: Yeah. I want to pit, like, the TRPC Prisma Planet skill back in the We're building right now. I want to pit it against some of the stacks, and I'm more comfortable with. And then I've built a lot more things with and see. Like, how do they perform.

00:54:33
caldotjs: sounds like a great project! looking forward to that

00:54:40
<transcript>: What is the code look like, what feels easier to maintain and change and evolve, you know that kind of thing.

00:54:41
caldotjs: rust backend incoming :>

00:54:47
jaystation3x: Can't wait for the IIS version.

00:54:51
<transcript>: Cool cow. That thinks that's not a good problem. Russ, back in and coming. You know what? I do want to learn some rest? I definitely want to learn some rest. I mean, I bought the prime keyboard.

00:54:51
<transcript>: start using the

00:54:53
<transcript>: Start using the Ovim.

00:54:53
<transcript>: the last

00:54:58
<transcript>: The last frontier is rest I'm gonna become my heroes.

00:54:58
<transcript>: like

00:54:59
stroopwafel26: C# version is gonna be lit

00:55:01
<transcript>: Like T's and proud and prime. I've got to learn rest.

00:55:07
<transcript>: Okay, so get state answer.

00:55:10
<transcript>: I really need to decide.

00:55:10
<transcript>: the

00:55:13
<transcript>: The actual experience of this game a little bit.

00:55:19
stroopwafel26: no cap

00:55:23
<transcript>: So we've got the buttons. All I know right now is that I want it to be like, you see an icon. You have to guess which service is it? That's the thing I really know.

00:55:23
<transcript>: but the

00:55:25
<transcript>: But the in terms of like.

00:55:25
<transcript>: is

00:55:27
<transcript>: Is it timed.

00:55:27
<transcript>: or is it just

00:55:28
<transcript>: Or is it just.

00:55:35
<transcript>: How long does it like, is each ramp time? Do you have a limit before? Like, the buzzer goes off.

00:55:35
<transcript>: or

00:55:42
<transcript>: Or just how long does it take you to answer ten of them? I don't know. Those kind of things. We got to decide on that stuff.

00:55:44
jobnbackpack: lmao

00:55:47
<transcript>: No cap C sharp version is gonna be lit.

00:55:47
<transcript>: the

00:55:53
<transcript>: The IIS versions. Yeah. We probably won't build that back in.

00:56:02
<transcript>: Okay. So let's think about this. I know I wanted to be multiplayer. I just know that'll be more fun.

00:56:02
<transcript>: like

00:56:04
jobnbackpack: prime really gets everyone into these things

00:56:09
<transcript>: Like it'd be fun to do this alone, but only like if you're trying to climb that leaderboard. I think.

00:56:09
<transcript>: i really

00:56:17
<transcript>: I really want to build to make it actually full stack and enjoyable. We're gonna have to build some features that are difficult, like.

00:56:17
<transcript>: i think

00:56:20
<transcript>: I think multiplayer is difficult enough.

00:56:24
<transcript>: He really does. Prime is prime is quite.

00:56:24
<transcript>: an inspir

00:56:26
jobnbackpack: and we love it!! *shouting*

00:56:28
<transcript>: An inspiration. I think that's what I was looking for. An influencer.

00:56:28
<transcript>: in the real

00:56:38
<transcript>: In the real sense. Not like an influencer. You know, there's like a lot of influencers. But prime actually influences a lot of people. I was just thinking this the other day. Actually, I'm glad you said that.

00:56:38
<transcript>: how many people

00:56:40
<transcript>: How many people I see on Twitter.

00:56:40
<transcript>: because

00:56:43
<transcript>: Because he retweets them and he should.

00:56:43
<transcript>: people that

00:56:44
shn4ke: a question regarding your overlays project is hosted anywhere

00:56:52
<transcript>: People that are like getting into Neovem, getting into them in general, because of prime, or getting into Rust, or getting into whatever. He's just a very inspirational character.

00:57:00
jobnbackpack: i think it was local

00:57:02
<transcript>: A question regarding your overlays project is hosted anywhere. Yeah, it's on GitHub.

00:57:10
<transcript>: Oh yeah, no, sorry. It runs locally, so my overlay is just run. It's an XJS app that runs locally.

00:57:10
<transcript>: code

00:57:13
adamdotdev: !github

00:57:15
<transcript>: Code is on GitHub, though I can't. I can't just do this. Unfortunately.

00:57:19
<transcript>: I thought about commands aren't working. I don't know why.

00:57:20
adamdotdev: !fossabot

00:57:24
<transcript>: Fasa box. Can I do that? Is it like, Wake it up.

00:57:28
stroopwafel26: Prime is going back to vs code https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen/status/1569782808721211394 MaxLOL

00:57:29
uberrick: !sendhelp

00:57:31
<transcript>: It's on GitHub, though it'd be like.

00:57:31
<transcript>: this

00:57:32
<transcript>: This.

00:57:32
<transcript>: it has

00:57:34
<transcript>: It has.

00:57:38
<transcript>: Adam alloton help Adam Elmore.

00:57:38
<transcript>: over

00:57:39
adamdotdev: github.com/adamelmore/overlays

00:57:41
<transcript>: Overlays there's the code, if you're interested.

00:57:41
<transcript>: yeah i

00:57:48
<transcript>: Yeah, I think I saw this yesterday. His little stream where he decided to go to Vs. Code for 100 a month.

00:57:50
<transcript>: That's awesome.

00:57:54
<transcript>: Okay.

00:57:58
uberrick: just ordered the new iphone :D

00:58:02
<transcript>: Let's answer some of these design questions. So if we want to design it to be multiplayer friendly, which we do.

00:58:02
<transcript>: should we just

00:58:07
<transcript>: Should we just build it from the start to be more player? Should I try and build the solo player kind of path first.

00:58:12
stroopwafel26: @UberRick it's sold out everywhere here lmao

00:58:13
<transcript>: These are the questions and do we need to have off? Do you have to like, log in with Twitter or something.

00:58:13
<transcript>: or disc

00:58:15
<transcript>: Or discord.

00:58:20
<transcript>: These are questions. I have.

00:58:20
<transcript>: what

00:58:22
<transcript>: What do we think.

00:58:22
<transcript>: should you have

00:58:31
<transcript>: Should you have to log in only if you want to. Like, I thought about doing like the old arcade thing where if you get a high score, you just put in like, three character, like three initials.

00:58:31
<transcript>: and like

00:58:38
<transcript>: And like, that's the leaderboard. It's just like, totally anonymized. But it's three, three letters, three characters.

00:58:38
<transcript>: we can do

00:58:41
<transcript>: We can do that kind of go old school.

00:58:41
<transcript>: and then that

00:58:44
shn4ke: I was looking into its code and saw localhost that's why I asked as I'm building something related but want to host online

00:58:49
<transcript>: And then that need to have off, I guess. And then multiplayers. You just like, choose your username every time you hit the site. And then you can like.

00:58:52
<transcript>: Interact with other people, maybe.

00:58:52
<transcript>: what

00:58:54
<transcript>: What do we think.

00:59:05
<transcript>: That's why I asked. Yeah, yeah. Schneik. It's the only reason it's not online. We do some, like local shell scripts and stuff like we run.

00:59:05
<transcript>: some local

00:59:13
uberrick: @stroopwafel26 yeah usually is here tbh. Tariff providers usually buy lots of them to be able to ship on the first day. So I've gone through o2 here

00:59:17
<transcript>: Some local shell scripts on my machine, so we have to run it locally. The next JS API wraps have to be local for us to do some that stuff, but that's the only reason you could definitely deploy your overlays.

00:59:24
<transcript>: Okay. I'm just gonna need to make some decisions here. I feel like.

00:59:24
<transcript>: it's not a few awesome

00:59:25
<transcript>: It's not a few awesome.

00:59:28
<transcript>: To decide how this game should work.

00:59:29
cowfacedude99: you are using nextauth right?

00:59:31
daeeyy: single player first, then it would be interesting to see how much refactoring is necessary for multiplayer

00:59:32
<transcript>: It's My game although it was named by Cubis.

00:59:32
<transcript>: thank you so much

00:59:39
<transcript>: Thank you so much Cubiz for naming the game. Aw, guess is a fantastic name. Thank you for the follow.

00:59:39
<transcript>: al kah

00:59:42
<transcript>: Al Kahi. I appreciate that. Follow.

00:59:47
<transcript>: Sorry if I bought your name. I bought to everybody's name. So at least everybody's in it together.

00:59:51
<transcript>: Next off, yeah, cow face if we if we do.

00:59:51
<transcript>: put

01:00:01
<transcript>: Put off into the game we'll use Next off not only because the teeth I mean the T three sack I know uses mix off, but I also just use next thought because I build everything in next.

01:00:01
cowfacedude99: I think you could leverage it for userinfo

01:00:10
<transcript>: Singer player first, then it would be interesting to see how much refactoring is that you're for multiplayer. Okay, that's a good idea. Could leverage it for user info.

01:00:17
stroopwafel26: @UberRick I'll wait till next weekend to see which shop has some left

01:00:20
<transcript>: Yeah. I guess we could just use next thoughts. I just. I hate building login pages, but I guess we make it really simple, just like a button. It doesn't have to be a login page. Just a button that's like login with Twitter.

01:00:22
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:00:27
<transcript>: I like that. Then you'll have like an avatar and all that.

01:00:41
<transcript>: Okay, so we have a login button. We're gonna build solo first. Let's just build a solo experience. So this do. I want it to be timedrounds? Maybe, like, two minutes on the clock.

01:00:44
<transcript>: How many can you get right in two minutes.

01:00:44
<transcript>: feels okay

01:00:45
<transcript>: Feels okay.

01:00:45
<transcript>: do we pen

01:00:52
<transcript>: Do we penalize people forgetting wrong answers? Like if they smash just guess really fast. Try and get as many.

01:00:52
<transcript>: in two minutes as a

01:00:54
<transcript>: In two minutes as a can.

01:01:00
<transcript>: Maybe we should have like negative points when you miss.

01:01:04
<transcript>: Ooh we could build in fun like.

01:01:04
<transcript>: like

01:01:10
<transcript>: Like lifeline kind of things. Like like little bonuses. Maybe get like a Street.

01:01:10
<transcript>: you earn little

01:01:17
<transcript>: You earn little bonuses, like eliminate two of the possibilities. That kind of thing. We could go all in on this thing and make it something.

01:01:24
<transcript>: That I don't know how to play this game. You have to be pretty indebs to want to play this game. Probably.

01:01:29
dyalicode: hello every body

01:01:33
<transcript>: And let's just make the game play so good that you just play despite the story. You know, that kind of game where it's just so fun you can't not play.

01:01:34
stream_kyle: Maybe points based on how quickly you get the answer

01:01:37
<transcript>: Hello, dialy.

01:01:48
<transcript>: Point space on how quickly you get the answer. Yeah, I like this complicated scoring system. Like if you get it in the first, like 1st, 2nd, that's like ten points.

01:01:48
<transcript>: and then if it's

01:01:50
<transcript>: And then if it's like.

01:01:53
<transcript>: It slowly fades to one point.

01:01:53
<transcript>: over

01:01:54
dyalicode: finnaly trpc :)

01:01:57
jaystation3x: I want to earn a certification badge from mastering this game.

01:01:59
<transcript>: Over some amount of time and then eventually it times out and it moves the next one that sounds pretty good.

01:02:05
<transcript>: Your certification bad.

01:02:13
<transcript>: Still have a sleep. I need food.

01:02:26
uberrick: yeah kahoot.it does similar for points based on answer speed

01:02:27
<transcript>: All right.

01:02:34
<transcript>: Oh, is my Chroma key? Way off is my green screen position? Poorly.

01:02:34
<transcript>: probably

01:02:35
<transcript>: Probably.

01:02:40
<transcript>: Caudit? What is this.

01:02:40
<transcript>: point

01:02:48
<transcript>: Point space answers. So yeah. Is there just a cut? Is there just a game of just copy. So we'd have to think about all these.

01:02:48
<transcript>: things

01:02:49
<transcript>: Things.

01:02:49
<transcript>: cahoots

01:02:52
<transcript>: Cahoots? What is this.

01:02:52
<transcript>: someone

01:02:55
<transcript>: Someone give me the TLDR on cahoots.

01:03:12
<transcript>: Who has a pin for me.

01:03:16
<transcript>: Create your own cahoot.

01:03:16
juanma_vfx: Well, it sounds like Kazoo

01:03:24
<transcript>: Sounds like Kazoo. Welcome to Chat Wan.

01:03:30
<transcript>: I accept your cookies.

01:03:40
<transcript>: Who is lots of games.

01:03:43
<transcript>: Lots and lots of games.

01:03:47
<transcript>: Okay.

01:03:54
cowfacedude99: totally unrelated, I am getting my dactyl shipped on friday!!! I tried to build one but gave up!!!!

01:03:58
developmentrobot: sorry if it has been asked before, but why the twitch handle change

01:03:59
uberrick: we used it at work to setup a quiz. You can setup multiple choice with image and text similar to what you're doing

01:04:04
<transcript>: So heard of this.

01:04:11
<transcript>: Why the Twitch angle change? Yeah, development. It has been discussed a little bit.

01:04:14
<transcript>: I just wanted to have the same username on all the platforms.

01:04:23
<transcript>: I've always had this very spread out, like different weird things on different platforms. I changed my Twitter handle to Adam Dev.

01:04:29
<transcript>: Because it was like, Adam is the only one where I had, like, this weird spelling of Adam.

01:04:36
<transcript>: Yeah, change Twitch to line with that. But I had to wait for two months.

01:04:36
<transcript>: i would have changed

01:04:43
<transcript>: I would have changed Twitch right away before I ever really started streaming. But when I signed up, I just did. I'm malmarket was available.

01:04:43
<transcript>: yeah

01:04:47
developmentrobot: gotcha, yeah same name on all platforms is better

01:04:48
<transcript>: Yeah. So I think I've got everything but GitHub. I reached out to the person.

01:04:48
<transcript>: that owns the github

01:04:49
<transcript>: That owns the GitHub.

01:04:49
<transcript>: adam dev

01:04:51
<transcript>: Adam Dev.

01:04:51
<transcript>: try

01:04:52
<transcript>: Try see if you would maybe.

01:04:52
<transcript>: hand that over

01:04:54
<transcript>: Hand that over.

01:04:56
<transcript>: It doesn't seem to be using it.

01:05:02
<transcript>: Yeah, that's why. Just consistency. I just wanted to have the same username on it on every platform.

01:05:09
<transcript>: And I own Adam Dev the domain. So that was kind of it's, like all pointing back to Adam Dev.

01:05:18
<transcript>: Oh, I see, Rick. You can actually create custom games.

01:05:25
<transcript>: Okay. So, Rick, I'm gonna lean on your opinions here. You've had experience playing a game like this.

01:05:28
<transcript>: So let's see if we do.

01:05:28
<transcript>: let's

01:05:31
<transcript>: Let's do the basic gameplay being.

01:05:31
<transcript>: you have ten

01:05:33
<transcript>: You have 10 seconds to answer.

01:05:38
<transcript>: And then at times out, that means a server needs to sort of be tracking.

01:05:38
<transcript>: the

01:05:40
<transcript>: The beginning of each round.

01:05:51
<transcript>: So that on the front end we'll have a timer and it'll be visual and you'll be able to see, like your timers counting down and you need to click it before the timer. But if you.

01:05:51
<transcript>: if the front

01:06:00
<transcript>: If the front end cheated and disable the timer or something, then if you submit an answer after the time that should be the expiration.

01:06:00
<transcript>: the server

01:06:02
<transcript>: The server is aware of that right.

01:06:02
<transcript>: so we do

01:06:08
<transcript>: So we do need to store we need to sort of track that state on the server.

01:06:08
<transcript>: and then

01:06:16
<transcript>: And then we're just kind of duplicating it. We're doing it on the front end, in the back end, frontend for convenience, for driving a visual timer and all that. But back end.

01:06:16
<transcript>: needs

01:06:21
<transcript>: Needs to be aware how long you've got. So. Okay, if we think of it like that.

01:06:27
<transcript>: Also, I'm just a little torn on, like how I want to store all this in the database.

01:06:39
<transcript>: Part of it is I haven't used the SQL based database in a while, so there's just like.

01:06:39
<transcript>: some

01:06:42
<transcript>: Some kind of getting back into that swing.

01:06:46
<transcript>: But also I just don't know how much this do I need to store versus.

01:06:49
<transcript>: Having stuff just.

01:06:49
<transcript>: in memory

01:06:51
<transcript>: In memory.

01:07:00
uberrick: yeah guess you could create a row before sending the question down to the user having an expires_at timestamp maybe?

01:07:01
evil_maximilian: hey ^^

01:07:04
<transcript>: Thanks for the follows. Tomorrow. An evil Maximilian.

01:07:07
<transcript>: Hey, welcome to chat.

01:07:07
<transcript>: evil

01:07:07
juanma_vfx: DynamoDB is not SQL, or are you talking other service?

01:07:08
<transcript>: Evil.

01:07:14
uberrick: prevents an answer being submitted after that?

01:07:15
<transcript>: Create a row before sending the question down to the user having expires that you.

01:07:15
tmrrow: howdy!

01:07:18
<transcript>: Think so, Rick. Let's do that.

01:07:23
<transcript>: Yeah, I'm not using DynamoDB. I normally do.

01:07:25
<transcript>: But I'm using.

01:07:31
<transcript>: Planetscale My sequel.

01:07:34
<transcript>: Hello tomorrow.

01:07:34
<transcript>: howdy

01:07:35
<transcript>: Howdy.

01:07:43
<transcript>: Rick will do that. So a new game. We have this game router as a new mutation.

01:07:46
<transcript>: You pass it a name.

01:07:46
<transcript>: remember

01:07:47
tnkhanh: why mySQL? why not yourSQL?

01:07:50
<transcript>: Remember what I was doing with the name, but I guess we'll leave it.

01:07:52
<transcript>: We're doing.

01:07:52
<transcript>: game

01:07:55
<transcript>: Game Create. So we've got this Prisma, schema.

01:07:55
evil_maximilian: i guess you could just create a table with a requestId / user / whatever and startTime

01:08:02
<transcript>: Here.

01:08:06
<transcript>: We started trying to model all this.

01:08:06
<transcript>: i don't know how well

01:08:08
<transcript>: I don't know how well we did but.

01:08:11
<transcript>: The game has multiple rounds.

01:08:18
<transcript>: Can I.

01:08:24
<transcript>: See.

01:08:27
<transcript>: So the round.

01:08:27
<transcript>: has an id

01:08:28
<transcript>: Has an ID.

01:08:31
<transcript>: Answer.

01:08:31
uberrick: guess Round should maybe relate to many Answers

01:08:39
<transcript>: Choices. These are all strings and that I don't know if that's right or not, I don't know what these are gonna hold.

01:08:40
azzer_41: @tnkhanh bdm tsss

01:08:46
<transcript>: But we need to start building it and see and to see what we can come up with, I guess.

01:08:46
<transcript>: i don't know if

01:08:49
<transcript>: I don't know if I did the relation right. I hope so.

01:08:54
<transcript>: Also game should probably have like a user ID.

01:09:01
<transcript>: But that means I'll have to do the off stuff.

01:09:14
<transcript>: Do we start with off.

01:09:14
<transcript>: that bill

01:09:17
<transcript>: That bill it without off first.

01:09:18
uberrick: brb

01:09:22
<transcript>: Why my sequence your sequel has to give them.

01:09:25
daeeyy: @tnkhanh someone should create ourSQL

01:09:28
<transcript>: Request request ID user whatever in start time.

01:09:41
<transcript>: That's kind of getting back to what should I store thing.

01:09:41
<transcript>: i think

01:09:42
<transcript>: I think the answers.

01:09:47
<transcript>: Like.

01:09:52
<transcript>: We're gonna make them up randomly for each question.

01:09:52
<transcript>: reach round

01:09:57
<transcript>: Reach round so each round I'll have an answer in choices including up randomly.

01:10:02
<transcript>: We're not gonna have, like, a pool of questions that we pull from.

01:10:06
<transcript>: Or maybe weren't suggesting that anyway. But.

01:10:12
<transcript>: Our sequel comes very inclusive.

01:10:18
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat, Azure.

01:10:22
<transcript>: All right. Let's do stuff. So.

01:10:29
<transcript>: Let's turn on keycaster for one.

01:10:30
k1ng440: hey

01:10:33
<transcript>: Can I do it.

01:10:34
evil_maximilian: i dont like left idealogies on tech xD

01:10:34
k1ng440: how is it going?

01:10:36
<transcript>: May not be running.

01:10:39
evil_maximilian: lets make moneySQL

01:10:40
k1ng440: what is t3?

01:10:43
<transcript>: I don't know why I'm so eager to turn on keycaster. Do you guys even like keycaster.

01:10:43
<transcript>: kind of gets in my way

01:10:46
<transcript>: Kind of gets in my way, but.

01:10:52
<transcript>: I guess we'll have it.

01:10:57
<transcript>: Got it.

01:11:00
<transcript>: I'll put it right here.

01:11:05
<transcript>: Okay.

01:11:11
<transcript>: So we have new gain.

01:11:13
<transcript>: The name in.

01:11:17
<transcript>: Creates a new we already have this working.

01:11:25
yeltrah_: Can you not add the keycaster to your bottom bar overlay? probably will need a white background right in the middle

01:11:25
<transcript>: Maybe I need to have a button and on the entry when you first load the page it's like start new game.

01:11:29
eaglestare: any valuable advice for getting interviewed at MANGA companies ? thanks

01:11:37
<transcript>: Then answer. We pass. It the game ID.

01:11:40
<transcript>: And the choice.

01:11:47
<transcript>: I guess.

01:11:47
<transcript>: we need to

01:11:50
<transcript>: We need to pass it around. Right.

01:11:50
<transcript>: so

01:11:58
<transcript>: So when you create a new game, it needs to create the game, but also just go ahead and return like a new round. We need to create a round as well. Maybe.

01:12:02
<transcript>: So let's say game equals that.

01:12:11
<transcript>: Round equals the Weight Context Prisma.

01:12:11
<transcript>: round

01:12:12
<transcript>: Round.

01:12:19
<transcript>: Is going to have a game ID.

01:12:23
<transcript>: This all strongly types. I would hope so, but.

01:12:28
<transcript>: Now, what's wrong? Here.

01:12:31
<transcript>: No information available.

01:12:31
<transcript>: see i'm still learning

01:12:34
<transcript>: See, I'm still learning Prisma. I feel like I haven't.

01:12:38
<transcript>: Updated Prisma or something.

01:12:51
<transcript>: Eagles there. Welcome to Chat and he valuable advice for getting introduced at Manga companies. Thanks is Manga the new thing? I guess that's what they all changed their names. And now it's manga.

01:12:52
eaglestare: yup

01:12:59
<transcript>: I don't have any tips. You may have any tips. I've never worked.

01:13:01
<transcript>: At a place like that.

01:13:08
<transcript>: I don't know that I have any tips. Thanks you thanks for the follow.

01:13:08
<transcript>: dam

01:13:10
<transcript>: Damn, Yo, Felix.

01:13:15
<transcript>: Money sequel.

01:13:17
tnkhanh: draw a lot of manga, I guess

01:13:22
<transcript>: What is T three.

01:13:27
<transcript>: A King T Three is the It's Theo's stack. If you're familiar with Theo.

01:13:30
<transcript>: And draw a lot of manga I guess.

01:13:33
k1ng440: what

01:13:38
<transcript>: Getting interviewed at manga companies. Yeah. I don't know what they look for. I don't know.

01:13:38
<transcript>: i

01:13:38
k1ng440: what stack?

01:13:40
<transcript>: I don't know. Like what.

01:13:41
stroopwafel26: gen z manga companies

01:13:42
<transcript>: Is a standout.

01:13:42
<transcript>: application

01:13:44
stroopwafel26: i have no idea

01:13:45
<transcript>: Application to a manga company look like.

01:13:46
shn4ke: tailwind, typescript,trpc

01:13:54
<transcript>: T three stack. So it's a tail? Yeah. Typescript. Trpc. Tailwind. Xjs.

01:13:59
<transcript>: I think that's the that's the T three stack.

01:14:01
k1ng440: KEKW

01:14:03
<transcript>: Okay. So if I need to I need to update something in Prisma. I guess.

01:14:05
shn4ke: next,and next-auth

01:14:06
<transcript>: What do we do here.

01:14:09
shn4ke: prisma

01:14:10
evil_maximilian: oh man how i hate tailwind

01:14:12
<transcript>: Prisma MPX.

01:14:12
<transcript>: prism

01:14:15
<transcript>: Prisma? Something.

01:14:19
<transcript>: Just making stuff up. No.

01:14:19
<transcript>: knit

01:14:21
<transcript>: Knit, migrate.

01:14:21
<transcript>: db

01:14:23
<transcript>: Db push.

01:14:27
<transcript>: Generate Ah generate a business it.

01:14:27
<transcript>: oh

01:14:29
<transcript>: Oh happens.

01:14:35
<transcript>: In NPX. Prisma. Generate.

01:14:40
<transcript>: Oh, I did break the I didn't do the relation. Right.

01:14:40
<transcript>: much first

01:14:45
k1ng440: tailwind for dumbasses

01:14:46
<transcript>: Much first only to existing fields the following fields in nonexistent this model game ID.

01:14:47
<transcript>: Oh okay.

01:14:49
<transcript>: Sounds reasonable.

01:14:53
<transcript>: So let's go back.

01:14:55
<transcript>: That's not where I want to go.

01:14:59
<transcript>: Here we go. So Game ID.

01:15:00
k1ng440: who doesnt want to learn css xD

01:15:04
<transcript>: I didn't even put Game ID here, did I game ID.

01:15:06
<transcript>: Is a string.

01:15:10
<transcript>: Do I need to say it's like.

01:15:20
<transcript>: So this one user ID. No, that's good. Okay, that's good. Save it.

01:15:22
<transcript>: Try it again.

01:15:27
<transcript>: More errors.

01:15:36
<transcript>: Field game and model round the ration field game on model around is missing an opposite relationship on the model game.

01:15:36
<transcript>: oh

01:15:36
<transcript>: Oh.

01:15:40
<transcript>: Prisma format, or add it manually.

01:15:40
<transcript>: i

01:15:45
<transcript>: I can do Prisma format? What's that do MPX Prisma format.

01:15:47
evil_maximilian: my prob with tailwind is the TERRIBLE inline css....

01:15:56
<transcript>: Choices and model realm can be a list. The current connector does not support lists of primitive types. Oh, what.

01:15:58
<transcript>: Do what.

01:16:05
<transcript>: Do lists of complex types, but not primitive types. That seems backward.

01:16:11
<transcript>: The same backward, emails.

01:16:16
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the follow. T and K.

01:16:20
<transcript>: Thank you so much.

01:16:23
<transcript>: For the follow.

01:16:29
<transcript>: I'm just stalling until Rick's back so Rick and tell me how to build this game.

01:16:29
tnkhanh: wooo!

01:16:32
<transcript>: Why can't I create.

01:16:32
<transcript>: you're telling me

01:16:35
<transcript>: You're telling me I can't have a string array.

01:16:37
<transcript>: Thing.

01:16:40
<transcript>: Kisma and Planet scale.

01:16:53
<transcript>: Well, I didn't love it being a string. Anyway, choices as a string felt weird.

01:16:53
<transcript>: i feel like i

01:16:55
<transcript>: I feel like I need, like.

01:16:58
<transcript>: Do I need a table.

01:16:58
<transcript>: i

01:17:01
<transcript>: I just need a map. I don't even need to be a table.

01:17:06
<transcript>: Mo Alley. Thank you so much for the raid. We'll do this here.

01:17:12
evil_maximilian: "raid"

01:17:13
<transcript>: 's Our Confetti. Thanks for joining us, Mo Alley. Appreciate it.

01:17:18
stroopwafel26: 60 fps confetti, love it

01:17:20
<transcript>: I feel like I'm missing something fundamental. Here.

01:17:22
<transcript>: About.

01:17:24
<transcript>: My sequel.

01:17:26
<transcript>: I can't do string arrays.

01:17:26
<transcript>: so these

01:17:31
<transcript>: So these only work these here because they're like connected.

01:17:31
<transcript>: probably

01:17:34
<transcript>: Probably so accounts if we go to account.

01:17:36
<transcript>: Yeah, Yeah.

01:17:44
<transcript>: User says a relation to user, and then Sessions has a relation. So. Okay. So then I'm ultimately I'm gonna have this.

01:17:44
<transcript>: like

01:17:46
<transcript>: Like round.

01:17:46
<transcript>: our

01:17:57
<transcript>: Our round like that. That's what they're gonna when I did the format thing, that's what it wants to do. But the answers and the choices need to be something. I guess so we're gonna we're gonna create a model for resources.

01:18:00
<transcript>: These are AWS Resources, right.

01:18:00
<transcript>: make sense

01:18:09
<transcript>: Make sense? Oh, I use my arrow keys? Oh, no? I go on vacation and I forget how to vim? I forget how to them.

01:18:13
<transcript>: Tell anyone they'll take away my Vim card.

01:18:16
<transcript>: Resources have an ID.

01:18:25
tnkhanh: arrow keys NotLikeThis

01:18:25
<transcript>: Do I want this to be.

01:18:28
<transcript>: Like an ID that I put in there.

01:18:33
<transcript>: Yeah, I'll put it in there. I'm not gonna autogenerate it.

01:18:36
<transcript>: Oh, come on.

01:18:41
<transcript>: Id. It has a name.

01:18:52
<transcript>: So we're gonna populate this table. I don't know. It feels bad to do in this table, like it's just another thing I have to maintain. But then I can reference resources, I guess.

01:18:58
<transcript>: I need to be able to do that. I don't know. This whole thing feels dumb. Like, Do I need all this stuff in a SQL database.

01:18:59
shn4ke: enum?

01:19:01
<transcript>: Arrow, keys? No.

01:19:06
<transcript>: And enum.

01:19:06
<transcript>: are

01:19:08
<transcript>: Are there enums in.

01:19:11
<transcript>: Prisma. Schemas.

01:19:20
<transcript>: The only reason I'm doing this. I mean, Ultimately, the only reason I'm doing this is that.

01:19:23
shn4ke: you can have enums

01:19:26
shn4ke: in prisma

01:19:27
<transcript>: Choices can't be a string array, but it could be oh, yeah? I don't want it to be it's just gonna be.

01:19:32
<transcript>: How do you do a string array in Prison and Planet Scale? You can't do that.

01:19:32
<transcript>: plan

01:19:36
<transcript>: Planet Scale Prisma String array.

01:19:40
<transcript>: Killer lists. Okay. Here we go.

01:19:49
<transcript>: Yeah, string. There we go. Reps that by the Moon only available if the underlying database supports scalar lists. So if I were using like.

01:19:49
<transcript>: postgr

01:19:52
<transcript>: Postgres. It would work. I'm guessing.

01:19:57
<transcript>: But my sequel doesn't have.

01:19:57
<transcript>: the

01:19:59
<transcript>: The is that the thing.

01:20:03
<transcript>: My sequel.

01:20:05
<transcript>: Postgres.

01:20:07
<transcript>: Okay.

01:20:10
<transcript>: Get the sense it's not available.

01:20:14
<transcript>: That's a bummer.

01:20:19
<transcript>: Why is my sequel so popular? If it's not as good as Postgres.

01:20:23
<transcript>: You can have email, enums and Prisma. Okay.

01:20:26
<transcript>: Do I want to be an enum.

01:20:34
<transcript>: I just wanted to exist as a map in my code. Honestly, I don't want to have a table with all these resources. I just want to be able to, like.

01:20:34
<transcript>: have

01:20:35
oskrm: sorry cant watch 1080p

01:20:36
<transcript>: Have a map.

01:20:36
<transcript>: in my code

01:20:39
<transcript>: In my code, where I grab items randomly.

01:20:41
<transcript>: That's what I want.

01:20:46
<transcript>: What's wrong with that? Nothing. Nothing wrong with that.

01:20:46
<transcript>: can't

01:20:46
oskrm: :(

01:20:48
<transcript>: Can't watch say ADP.

01:20:48
<transcript>: why are you

01:20:49
<transcript>: Why are you sorry.

01:20:49
<transcript>: i'm

01:20:51
<transcript>: I'm sorry.

01:20:51
<transcript>: can you

01:20:56
<transcript>: Can you? Oh, you can't you're saying you can't watch my stream because it's in ADP.

01:21:04
<transcript>: And it's not letting you, like, do the thing where you can, like, watch a slower version. There's a lower quality version.

01:21:04
<transcript>: does it give you

01:21:07
<transcript>: Does it give you those options? Maybe not.

01:21:07
<transcript>: settings

01:21:09
<transcript>: Settings, quality.

01:21:11
<transcript>: Auto? Oh, no.

01:21:13
<transcript>: Oh no.

01:21:17
<transcript>: They're not giving you all the option to watch like 720p.

01:21:17
oskrm: nope

01:21:21
<transcript>: It's just forcing 1080p on you. No.

01:21:21
<transcript>: i'm so sorry

01:21:22
<transcript>: I'm so sorry.

01:21:22
<transcript>: i've heard

01:21:29
<transcript>: I've heard of this. I've heard that sometimes you can't just you don't get the transcode or whatever it's called. I don't know.

01:21:31
<transcript>: Transcoding.

01:21:31
<transcript>: is that it

01:21:32
<transcript>: Is that it.

01:21:32
<transcript>: 's not

01:21:38
shn4ke: if you're not partner twitch sometimes doesn't provide transcoding

01:21:38
<transcript>: 's not giving me those today. I'm so sorry. I thought I always got those. I guess I don't.

01:21:45
<transcript>: Wilp, maybe I need to switch to 720 B if you're not partner, Twitch sometimes doesn't provide transcoding. Okay.

01:21:48
<transcript>: Interesting.

01:21:48
<transcript>: interesting

01:21:49
<transcript>: Interesting.

01:21:49
<transcript>: i just need

01:21:52
<transcript>: I just need to be a partner. What do I got to do to be a partner.

01:21:54
<transcript>: I just need more people.

01:21:54
<transcript>: watching

01:21:57
<transcript>: Watching. I think that what I thought.

01:22:05
<transcript>: Just need you all to keep showing up, make me a partner so we can stream one thousand and eighty P, and you guys can watch it whatever you want.

01:22:08
<transcript>: I'm so sorry.

01:22:08
<transcript>: osk

01:22:10
<transcript>: Osk. I'm so sorry.

01:22:15
<transcript>: I don't think I can switch to 720p mid stream or I would just switch.

01:22:15
<transcript>: like i don't think

01:22:17
<transcript>: Like, I don't think I can do that right.

01:22:19
jobnbackpack: no its only 1080

01:22:22
shn4ke: you can have a look at your achievements in twitch dashboard

01:22:24
<transcript>: Only 1080.

01:22:27
<transcript>: Sorry about it, everybody.

01:22:27
<transcript>: so

01:22:29
stroopwafel26: you can stream in 4k and have twitch transcode down to 1080p :P

01:22:30
<transcript>: So that's why people, maybe earlier said it was lagging.

01:22:34
jobnbackpack: yeah thats the reason why it lags for me

01:22:36
<transcript>: Look at your achievements and Twitch Dashboard. You can stream in four K and have Twitch transcode down as ten AP.

01:22:39
<transcript>: That sounds like going the wrong direction. Stroop.

01:22:39
<transcript>: that's

01:22:40
shn4ke: and see what you need for partner

01:22:42
<transcript>: That's why it lacks you I'm so sorry, everybody.

01:22:42
<transcript>: we're just stuck

01:22:45
<transcript>: We're just stuck with the high quality 1080p stream today.

01:22:49
stroopwafel26: more pixels = better

01:22:54
<transcript>: I'll look into getting partner. We'll see. I don't know. I heard it can take years to be partner. So maybe I won't just look into that.

01:22:54
<transcript>: maybe

01:23:01
otifex: I'm watching 1080 hmm

01:23:02
<transcript>: Maybe it'll just be a while and I need to start streaming seven hundred and twenty P I will look into streaming in 720p that I don't want people not be able to watch because.

01:23:02
<transcript>: it's too high quality

01:23:03
<transcript>: It's too high quality.

01:23:03
<transcript>: to band

01:23:05
<transcript>: To bandwidth intensive.

01:23:05
<transcript>: okay

01:23:08
<transcript>: Okay, resources.

01:23:08
<transcript>: we're not doing this

01:23:11
<transcript>: We're not doing this. We're not doing this.

01:23:11
<transcript>: we're not

01:23:13
<transcript>: We're not doing it.

01:23:24
<transcript>: Say no model game. We have rounds, but around has an answer and choices which cannot be a string array. Are we gonna string string concat.

01:23:29
<transcript>: With commas. Are we gonna have a list of choices.

01:23:29
<transcript>: as a string

01:23:31
stroopwafel26: I have gigabit internet so I'd opt for the 4k stream

01:23:35
<transcript>: As a string with commas in it common to limited list. Are we doing that.

01:23:35
<transcript>: is that

01:23:36
jobnbackpack: yeah i usually do as well but im working from somewhere else this week and the internet is shit ^^

01:23:42
<transcript>: Is that awful to do that in a MySQL what do you all do? People who use my sequel? What do you do when you want to store.

01:23:42
<transcript>: an array of

01:23:44
<transcript>: An array of things like strings.

01:23:49
<transcript>: In your table. In a single column. What do you do? What do you do.

01:23:56
<transcript>: What do you do.

01:24:09
jobnbackpack: rip i guess ^^

01:24:12
<transcript>: Looking my achievements in Twitch Dashboard. Let's see. Achievements. Oh, I found that right away.

01:24:14
<transcript>: Let's do it. Achievements.

01:24:15
shn4ke: if you have streamed for 25hours, stream for 12 days, and average of 75 viewers in last 30 days you should be able to apply for partner

01:24:17
<transcript>: Path to partner.

01:24:18
th3_l3m0n: just put it as a json object into the SQL datapase Kappa

01:24:20
<transcript>: Stream for 25 hours.

01:24:20
<transcript>: check

01:24:33
<transcript>: Check I streamed for 75 69 stream on twelve different days. Check I've streamed for 16 different days. Average of 75 viewers concurrent viewership excluding hosts, raids and embeds.

01:24:35
jenswoeste: Depending on the amount of string elements I would be tempted to store the string array in a json string

01:24:40
<transcript>: Average is 75 viewers. I'm averaging 69. Nice .24 viewers.

01:24:40
<transcript>: so

01:24:43
<transcript>: So I'm six viewers away.

01:24:43
<transcript>: from

01:24:45
<transcript>: From.

01:24:48
<transcript>: Is that. And then I'm a partner. So how it works.

01:24:54
<transcript>: If I can start averaging.

01:24:54
<transcript>: five

01:24:56
<transcript>: Five more viewers. Almost.

01:24:56
<transcript>: six

01:24:58
shn4ke: then you can apply for partner

01:25:03
<transcript>: Six viewers more. Then we'll be a partner here, and we can get the transcoding. Is that what I'm hearing.

01:25:03
<transcript>: or

01:25:19
<transcript>: Or now to be eligible to apply to the Partner program, you must meet all these requirements within the same 30 day period. All calculations exclude Premieres reruns subscriber streams, and watch parties. Please note that applying does not guarantee partnership. Okay, so I can apply to B. A. Partner.

01:25:19
<transcript>: but

01:25:21
<transcript>: But it's not.

01:25:21
<transcript>: i'm not just

01:25:24
<transcript>: I'm not just gonna get to be partner.

01:25:24
<transcript>: i apply

01:25:25
<transcript>: I apply.

01:25:27
<transcript>: Okay.

01:25:32
<transcript>: Got it.

01:25:36
<transcript>: Okay.

01:25:45
kociqq: Keep it as a enum for easability elaYEP

01:25:48
<transcript>: Just put a JSON object into the sequel database. I mean, sounds like a bad idea, I guess, but we could.

01:25:48
<transcript>: that's

01:25:51
<transcript>: That's why I'm debating right now.

01:25:58
<transcript>: So sorry, job. So sorry, Oscar, that I have the.

01:25:58
<transcript>: la

01:26:00
<transcript>: Lack of transcoding options.

01:26:03
<transcript>: I don't think I can just do.

01:26:07
<transcript>: The 720 piece.

01:26:09
<transcript>: Midstream.

01:26:16
<transcript>: If you have streams 25 hours stream for twelve days and average 25 years, you should be able to apply for partner. Yeah, that's what we just read.

01:26:21
<transcript>: Found the amount of string elements. I would be tempted to sort of string array in a JSON string. Okay.

01:26:27
<transcript>: Keep it as an easy enum. Wow, cozy.

01:26:27
<transcript>: your username

01:26:29
<transcript>: Your username is like glowing.

01:26:32
<transcript>: How did you do that? Cosi.

01:26:34
<transcript>: Look at that.

01:26:36
kociqq: 7tv

01:26:39
<transcript>: Look at your username.

01:26:45
<transcript>: It's like Golden Seven. Tv.

01:26:48
<transcript>: Okay.

01:26:48
<transcript>: so if

01:26:53
<transcript>: So if you're a seven TV person, you get to glow your username. That's amazing looking.

01:26:53
shn4ke: 7tv sub

01:26:57
<transcript>: An enum for easibility.

01:26:59
kociqq: sub yeah

01:26:59
<transcript>: Easibility.

01:26:59
<transcript>: is that

01:27:04
<transcript>: Is that a word? I don't think that's word. I think you made that out.

01:27:13
daeeyy: I don't see any glow

01:27:14
<transcript>: Like, we're just gonna do this, people. Just a string. We're gonna stringify an array and put it in choices, ultimately.

01:27:20
<transcript>: Do we even need to store the choices.

01:27:23
<transcript>: We just need to know the correct answer.

01:27:23
<transcript>: if

01:27:27
stroopwafel26: no glowing usernames on my end

01:27:28
<transcript>: If they don't submit one of the choices as an answer, visit matter.

01:27:29
kociqq: https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=easability Kappa

01:27:31
<transcript>: Does it even matter.

01:27:40
<transcript>: It's still wrong whether they chose a like if they just sent their own API calls and ignored the UI, ignored the suggestions.

01:27:40
<transcript>: would

01:27:43
<transcript>: Would it matter? I don't think we need to store the choices.

01:27:43
<transcript>: that's

01:27:45
<transcript>: That's what I think.

01:27:51
<transcript>: Ease ability let me Google it.

01:27:55
<transcript>: You don't see the glow. I see the glow. It's glowing.

01:27:55
<transcript>: coasted qq

01:27:58
<transcript>: Coasted. Qq. Glowing. So cool. Like.

01:27:58
<transcript>: iowan

01:28:00
<transcript>: Iowan thank you so much for the follow.

01:28:04
jenswoeste: but you would need to store if the answer was correct or not?

01:28:09
kociqq: you have to have 7tv extension enabled

01:28:09
<transcript>: And Elgolf Wingo. Did I tell you thank you for the follow? Thank you. If I didn't tell you already. Thank you so much. Okay, we're just doing that.

01:28:09
<transcript>: yolow

01:28:11
<transcript>: Yolow.

01:28:15
kociqq: to be able to see that

01:28:15
<transcript>: yolowatted

01:28:17
juanma_vfx: choiceColumn1, choiceColumn2, rightChoiceColumn (jk

01:28:24
<transcript>: Yolowatted, we've got rounds. We've got each round has a game. Oh, yeah? We're gonna just remove choices. I don't even think we need to. Oh, what.

01:28:24
<transcript>: changed

01:28:26
stroopwafel26: @KociQQ I'm not cool enough for that

01:28:27
<transcript>: Changed? Oh, no.

01:28:27
<transcript>: let's rel

01:28:28
<transcript>: Let's reload it.

01:28:28
<transcript>: how do i

01:28:31
<transcript>: How do I oop, how do I reload this.

01:28:35
<transcript>: Reload.

01:28:40
<transcript>: No, that's not it. How do you reload a buffer that's already open.

01:28:43
<transcript>: Anyone now.

01:28:48
<transcript>: Okay.

01:28:51
<transcript>: Let's do this.

01:28:54
daeeyy: @Juanma_vfx no joke, we have stuff like that in our 22 year old db schema

01:28:56
<transcript>: How do I reload a buffer.

01:29:02
<transcript>: Oh, load five. Here we go. There we go. Okay. So this is after I did the format command.

01:29:02
<transcript>: right

01:29:04
<transcript>: Right.

01:29:05
<transcript>: Game roll.

01:29:05
<transcript>: rolls

01:29:08
kociqq: @KociQQ it's not that cool, so you are ok without it SeemsGood

01:29:11
<transcript>: Rolls. Oh, so it's formatted. It formatted. It like it changed some things. Okay. That's okay.

01:29:18
shn4ke: I just and twitch is having issues I think that's the reason you might not be getting transcoding as they prioritize partners

01:29:20
<transcript>: I thought I want to get rid of choices, so we save that now we're gonna do MPX Prisma, generate.

01:29:25
<transcript>: And MPX Prisma.

01:29:25
<transcript>: db

01:29:31
<transcript>: Db push is that is that a command? Think that's what we do can't reach database over. Oh, I gotta run the proxy.

01:29:31
<transcript>: so let's

01:29:33
<transcript>: So let's see that's gonna be.

01:29:33
<transcript>: over here

01:29:39
<transcript>: Over here we're gonna do fish, and then we're gonna do piececale.

01:29:41
<transcript>: Yeah like that.

01:29:44
<transcript>: Yeah.

01:29:51
<transcript>: Let's do this again.

01:29:55
<transcript>: Push.

01:30:00
<transcript>: Did it work. It worked. Okay.

01:30:04
<transcript>: So now if I go back here.

01:30:07
<transcript>: To my game.

01:30:07
<transcript>: router

01:30:09
<transcript>: Router right here.

01:30:13
<transcript>: Now I should have this round.

01:30:13
<transcript>: let's see

01:30:17
<transcript>: Let's see what's wrong with that Prisma round.

01:30:20
<transcript>: Let's switch on with that.

01:30:28
<transcript>: What's? There's not a there's not a round. Then I just create a round type.

01:30:33
<transcript>: Lstp Restart strata.

01:30:38
<transcript>: Okay. Here we go.

01:30:38
<transcript>: it works

01:30:40
<transcript>: It works.

01:30:40
<transcript>: what's

01:30:42
<transcript>: What's wrong with this data.

01:30:45
<transcript>: Are we just missing some.

01:30:52
<transcript>: Let's see. Here we go. Round is cleared. It's went round.

01:30:52
<transcript>: now

01:30:56
<transcript>: Now assignable type. Okay, so I'm just missing some properties. Maybe.

01:30:59
kociqq: sometimes it gets stuck until lsp picks it up after you regenerate the client

01:31:03
schrew: Gm vacation adam!

01:31:04
<transcript>: I need to have not an ID, right? Because that's gonna be auto populated.

01:31:07
<transcript>: We need an answer.

01:31:10
<transcript>: That works.

01:31:10
<transcript>: we

01:31:11
jenswoeste: current theme of stream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnPL5OXSBNE

01:31:13
<transcript>: We did it. We have a round.

01:31:13
<transcript>: we created

01:31:18
<transcript>: We created a game we created around we're gonna return what.

01:31:21
<transcript>: Does this have to return a game.

01:31:28
<transcript>: Did we like type this to be only no have these I'm just learning with the RPC. How do these work.

01:31:48
<transcript>: You need to store if the answer was correct or not. Yeah. Yen's, I think we just store the answer though. I think that's okay, right. We just store the answer.

01:31:49
<transcript>: And.

01:32:01
<transcript>: Good morning, Shrew. Vacation. Adam, if we just stored the answer, then when they submit any answer, we can tell if it's correct or not. We don't need to know if we gave them that as a choice or not.

01:32:01
<transcript>: we're just gonna

01:32:05
<transcript>: We're just gonna give them choices when they start a new round.

01:32:07
<transcript>: And.

01:32:07
<transcript>: that's that

01:32:10
<transcript>: That's that they can submit whatever they want, but.

01:32:10
<transcript>: the

01:32:13
<transcript>: The answer will be one of those choices.

01:32:13
<transcript>: okay

01:32:15
<transcript>: Okay. I need to take quick break.

01:32:15
<transcript>: actually

01:32:25
<transcript>: Actually, I'm gonna make my dandy blend and do all that stuff. I'm gonna try and spike my dandy blend with some caffeine because I'm feeling the withdrawals of caffeine from vacation. I drink coffee.

01:32:25
<transcript>: and i need some

01:32:27
<transcript>: And I need some.

01:32:27
<transcript>: to kind of get

01:32:30
<transcript>: To kind of get up this morning. I'm just not there yet.

01:32:36
<transcript>: So I'm gonna take break, make some Dany Lind, I'll be back in a bit. And if you have ideas about how this game should work.

01:32:36
<transcript>: now it's a great

01:32:41
<transcript>: Now it's a great time to think about those. Maybe jot them down, send them over in chat.

01:32:41
<transcript>: we're making

01:32:46
<transcript>: We're making it up as we go, but I'm pretty excited about the end results.

01:32:46
<transcript>: it's gonna be fun

01:32:49
<transcript>: It's gonna be fun? It's gonna be fun? It's gonna be fun to be able to play this with you all.

01:32:49
<transcript>: okay

01:32:52
<transcript>: Okay. I'll be right back. We'll see if my brake screen works.

01:49:32
jobnbackpack: reckH  reckH

01:50:24
<transcript>: All right. Sorry about that. That was a bit.

01:50:24
<transcript>: there's a bit of a

01:50:26
<transcript>: There's a bit of a break.

01:50:26
<transcript>: couldn't

01:50:28
<transcript>: Couldn't find any caffeine.

01:50:29
<transcript>: Sad story.

01:50:34
<transcript>: Really hoped. Really. Hopefully.

01:50:45
<transcript>: Let's pause. Really have to build a drink. Some caffeine. Sort of soft landing. Like the US economy. There'll be no soft landing for me. Coming straight off the caffeine from vacation.

01:50:45
<transcript>: and

01:50:46
<transcript>: And.

01:50:46
<transcript>: crash landing

01:50:56
<transcript>: Crash landing into reality where I don't drink caffeine. I don't drink caffeine, right? I shouldn't drink caffeine. Should I just go back to caffeine? I used to drink it every day.

01:50:57
caldotjs: do you have some sort of supplement stack you use when in need for really focused work, (besides caffeine)

01:50:58
<transcript>: I stopped.

01:50:58
<transcript>: it's better

01:51:01
<transcript>: It's better. Right not to do caffeine.

01:51:08
<transcript>: Do you have some sort of supplement stack use when I need for really focus work Besides caffeine.

01:51:20
<transcript>: No, I eat Lara bars and I drink Dandy blend. I don't know. Does Dandelion Root has some kind of focusing attributes? Because I do drink a lot of Dandelion Root tea.

01:51:26
<transcript>: I kind of miss Caffeine. Anybody here.

01:51:26
<transcript>: drink caffeine

01:51:29
<transcript>: Drink caffeine, and not regret it.

01:51:42
<transcript>: I used to do it every day. I had coffee every morning. I loved the routine of making coffee. I loved the whole ritual of it. And then this drink was fantastic as well.

01:51:54
<transcript>: But then it's like you just need it every day. And I didn't like that part about it. Where you just if you don't drink it, you're just struggling, like today for me. I had copy yesterday.

01:51:54
<transcript>: so

01:51:56
<transcript>: So I'm struggling today.

01:51:58
schrew: when I'm tired, caffeine makes me anxious. and still tired. So it's known that it's not good for me

01:51:59
madlep: All the coffee all the time. Coffee is gold

01:52:02
<transcript>: But that first day you have coffee when you haven't had caffeine for a long time.

01:52:02
<transcript>: that's

01:52:04
<transcript>: That's a good day.

01:52:11
<transcript>: When I'm tired. Caffeine makes me anxious and still tired. So it's known that it's not good for me. Yeah, I know.

01:52:24
caldotjs: yes, but I use it really consciously. coffee, l-theanine & zyn = 3-4h in the matrix :D

01:52:27
<transcript>: And then Madlip, you're the little personal mattressholder. All the coffee all the time. Coffee is gold. I do love it. I come from a coffee family. My dad drinks like, 15 cups of coffee a day. That's no exaggeration. He drinks it right before bed. Like, I don't know how he does that.

01:52:30
<transcript>: Use it really consciously coffee.

01:52:30
<transcript>: i

01:52:34
<transcript>: I see Anine and zine.

01:52:34
<transcript>: three four

01:52:36
<transcript>: Three fourth in the matrix.

01:52:36
<transcript>: oh three to four

01:52:39
codeforreal1: I love coffee

01:52:42
<transcript>: Oh, three to 4 hours in the Matrix. Okay. So you take all those things and then.

01:52:42
<transcript>: you're doing great

01:52:48
<transcript>: You're doing great for three or 4 hours. What's it like after those three 4 hours? Is there a big falloff.

01:52:48
<transcript>: from those things

01:52:49
<transcript>: From those things.

01:52:53
codeforreal1: 15? That's addiction.

01:52:54
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat Code for Real. You love coffee.

01:52:54
<transcript>: i also love coffee

01:52:56
<transcript>: I also love coffee. I just don't drink it.

01:52:56
<transcript>: fabio

01:52:59
<transcript>: Fabio, thank you so much for the follow.

01:53:06
<transcript>: 15. Yeah, no, he's for sure. Addicted to coffee. That's known. Known facts about my father.

01:53:10
<transcript>: He would not deny that he's addicted to coffee.

01:53:13
daeeyy: L-theanine does help, you get a smoother hit of caffine

01:53:16
<transcript>: So we're gonna go back to it here.

01:53:21
stroopwafel26: no coffee nor alcohol for me, it interferes with my long distance running goals

01:53:21
<transcript>: Elle, you guys are typing that word like, you know that word? Ltheonine.

01:53:21
<transcript>: so just like

01:53:23
<transcript>: So just like a word you type a lot.

01:53:26
<transcript>: Else in some kind of supplement.

01:53:29
<transcript>: Smoother, hidden caffeine.

01:53:33
madlep: Living in Australia pros: Coffee is awesome. Living in Australia cons: Internet is not.

01:53:39
<transcript>: Stroop no coffee nor alcohol. For me, it interferes with my longdistance running goals. Ooh, now that'll do it have a long distance running goal that'll eliminate a lot of bad things from real life. Probably.

01:53:43
<transcript>: What are your goals? Troop like.

01:53:43
<transcript>: i'm sure you

01:53:47
caldotjs: not really since theanine kinda buffers the caffeine and coming of zyn (nicotine) is generally quite pleasant. Most of the times I hit the gym right afterwards. so, no.. :)

01:53:54
<transcript>: I'm sure you run marathons if you're a long distance runner with that has goals. I'm just assuming if if you've gotten that far, you probably got the sticker that you can put on your car.

01:54:02
<transcript>: Living in Australia pros Coffee's on living in Australia cons internet is not. Yeah, I'm sorry, everybody. I might cut the stream a little short today.

01:54:02
<transcript>: i've learned

01:54:08
<transcript>: I've learned that everyone is stuck with 1080p today. There's no transcoding. Sorry about that.

01:54:08
<transcript>: i

01:54:09
<transcript>: I.

01:54:13
stroopwafel26: I did marathons and getting back to them, goal is to run an ultra eventually

01:54:16
<transcript>: Just assumed everyone could watch it in whatever quality was best for them.

01:54:19
<transcript>: But that's not what I'm learning today.

01:54:23
<transcript>: Since Cnning kind of buffers the caffeine and coming of.

01:54:33
m4z4f4k4: !camera

01:54:37
<transcript>: Coming off Zinn Nicotine is generally quite pleasant. Most of the times I hit the gem right afterwards, so no. Okay, interesting. You did marathons. Getting back to them. Goal is to run an Ultra eventually. What is an ultra marathon? I forget it's a lot.

01:54:45
<transcript>: Oh, welcome to Chat M. Four Z. I said all because I used to have a camera command, but our commands aren't working.

01:54:47
stroopwafel26: an ultra is 50k+

01:54:47
<transcript>: Faucet bot is broken.

01:54:47
<transcript>: on

01:54:48
madlep: Actually seems to be working ok. Says I'm getting 1080p60

01:54:53
kuubitti: "stuck with 1080p" doesn't sound so bad

01:54:54
<transcript>: On my channel because I think it's probably because I renamed my channel. I changed my username.

01:54:59
<transcript>: 50k wait. I don't know. Kilometers. How many miles is that.

01:55:00
danielgerep: !why?

01:55:07
<transcript>: Mad let you're getting one thousand and eighty P sixty yeah. For people who can stream that much.

01:55:07
<transcript>: that much

01:55:09
<transcript>: That much bandwidth, I guess.

01:55:14
<transcript>: That's good. But for those who can't.

01:55:16
stroopwafel26: 50km is 31 miles

01:55:23
<transcript>: Daniel Grep. Why? Why am I Command's not working? Is that what you mean? So my camera is a Sony, a seven s, three verse. The person who asks what my camera was.

01:55:27
<transcript>: 31 miles that is a long ways.

01:55:27
<transcript>: i

01:55:33
<transcript>: I don't like driving 31 miles. I certainly wouldn't like to run it. That sounds extremely hard.

01:55:42
<transcript>: And if I walked it, I would take days to walk through your 31 miles. I'm guessing. I don't know. I've never walked more than like a mile.

01:55:46
<transcript>: Okay. We're gonna go back to it.

01:55:50
<transcript>: What are we going back to? We're going back to AW, guess.

01:55:50
<transcript>: i love

01:55:52
<transcript>: I love that name. So much.

01:55:52
<transcript>: the

01:55:58
<transcript>: The name is so good thank you Cube is for coming up with the name.

01:56:02
stroopwafel26: I want to do the Moab 250 some time but that's a whole other league and I'd have to really commit

01:56:03
<transcript>: Okay. So we have to create a round. We have to pass a game. Id.

01:56:03
<transcript>: and an answer

01:56:04
<transcript>: And an answer.

01:56:04
<transcript>: let's go back

01:56:07
<transcript>: Let's go back over to our schema.

01:56:07
<transcript>: is that it

01:56:09
<transcript>: Is that it Game ID answer.

01:56:09
<transcript>: yeah

01:56:18
<transcript>: Yeah. And the ID is created automatically. Okay, so now it's this point. We have a round. We're gonna return. I just want to see. Can I return.

01:56:22
<transcript>: Oh, when I create a round.

01:56:26
<transcript>: I have to pass an answer, and then we have to return choices.

01:56:26
<transcript>: how

01:56:28
<transcript>: How does this work in the.

01:56:33
<transcript>: T three. Can I just return whatever I want.

01:56:34
kuubitti: 7/10 guesses correct and you get a certificate?

01:56:37
<transcript>: Can I just say I want to return.

01:56:39
<transcript>: Thing.

01:56:39
<transcript>: deal with it

01:56:40
<transcript>: Deal with it.

01:56:47
<transcript>: Equals bar. Can I do that.

01:56:47
<transcript>: is this all k

01:56:49
<transcript>: Is this all kosher.

01:56:49
<transcript>: it'll just

01:56:51
<transcript>: It'll just like, sort it out.

01:56:55
<transcript>: Front end, I guess.

01:56:55
<transcript>: now

01:56:57
<transcript>: Now if I go to my game.

01:56:59
<transcript>: Index.

01:57:01
<transcript>: Age.

01:57:07
<transcript>: I want to see this work. New game. Mutation. Mutate. I need the response now.

01:57:13
<transcript>: Wait.

01:57:16
<transcript>: This is gonna have to be in a function.

01:57:19
<transcript>: An async function.

01:57:29
ziindev: His editor is so cool and sharp

01:57:31
<transcript>: And then we're gonna do.

01:57:34
<transcript>: So response.

01:57:34
<transcript>: what's the type of

01:57:41
<transcript>: What's the type of this void? So mutate does not. I was it mutate async.

01:57:47
<transcript>: I read property create of undefined. Where is that? At.

01:57:49
<transcript>: Pc.

01:57:49
<transcript>: okay we'll go back

01:57:59
<transcript>: Okay, we'll go back and look at that in a second. What type is this? Look at that food string idea. Okay, so it works. And that's pretty cool. I guess that's the whole draw of TRPC. Right. Type, safety.

01:58:01
<transcript>: Type safety.

01:58:01
<transcript>: the whole

01:58:03
<transcript>: The whole point.

01:58:12
<transcript>: The Moab 250 sometimes, but that's a whole other League have to really commit. That sounds hard. 250 km.

01:58:19
<transcript>: Oh, my word. That'd be like five times 30, maybe like a are you kidding me.

01:58:19
<transcript>: seven

01:58:24
<transcript>: Seven out of ten guests is correct. And you get a certificate. That sounds good. Committee.

01:58:30
<transcript>: What is it, an official certificate or just a made up certificate that we come up with, I guess.

01:58:35
<transcript>: Okay so we have game new.

01:58:38
<transcript>: I.

01:58:54
<transcript>: 've first of all, what's wrong here? Cannot read properly create of undefined so round and I may have to restart the server we learned this last time. Right.

01:58:54
<transcript>: which

01:58:55
kuubitti: definitely should be shareable on social media to make this viral

01:58:57
<transcript>: Which is a bummer, but.

01:58:57
<transcript>: apparently

01:58:57
stroopwafel26: Sorry I mistyped, Moab 240, it's 240 miles

01:59:05
<transcript>: Apparently if you make changes to the thing, you have to restart the server. I'm not sure what if it's when you make changes to.

01:59:10
<transcript>: What you make changes to the Schema, I guess.

01:59:10
<transcript>: then you have

01:59:14
<transcript>: Then you have to research the server. Kind of a bummer.

01:59:22
<transcript>: Kind of a bummer, but I guess that's what it is. Zelen, welcome to Chat. Zelendev.

01:59:22
<transcript>: his editor

01:59:25
<transcript>: His editor is so cool and Sharpie. Talking about my editor.

01:59:25
<transcript>: in vim

01:59:26
<transcript>: In vim.

01:59:26
<transcript>: neove

01:59:28
<transcript>: Neovem I'm New to New York.

01:59:28
<transcript>: it's been a few weeks

01:59:34
<transcript>: It's been a few weeks now. This very channel taught me how to kneel them. I would have never.

01:59:34
<transcript>: used no

01:59:37
<transcript>: Used no ma'am, if not for Twitch.

01:59:42
<transcript>: I came over to Twitch.

01:59:42
<transcript>: i used to be

01:59:44
<transcript>: I used to be a vs. Coder.

01:59:57
<transcript>: And when I joined Twitch and started streaming, I learned in order to stream Game into development or whatever software and name development on Twitch, you have to use Neil them. It's a rule, actually.

02:00:01
fall1nn: wasing hands after stream for a few hours after neovim )))))

02:00:02
<transcript>: A joke. It's not. You can use whatever you want.

02:00:02
<transcript>: but prime

02:00:06
fall1nn: *washing

02:00:08
<transcript>: But PrimeGen super cool. I was very inspired by Primer. And watching him fly around on vim.

02:00:08
<transcript>: did it

02:00:09
<transcript>: Did it for me.

02:00:12
<transcript>: I knew I had to use neovim.

02:00:12
<transcript>: okay

02:00:13
uberrick: are you using tmux on top? This top bar is new haha

02:00:16
<transcript>: Okay also teach shout at the teach he's awesome.

02:00:24
<transcript>: With Teach back to Streaming yet he had a new new baby, and I don't I don't know if I've seen him on Twitch since then.

02:00:34
<transcript>: Yeah, Rick, that's tmux we're using teamups. Now I move the top bar. The team up bar is at the top. That's right.

02:00:40
<transcript>: Okay, so what do I want to return here? I want to return the round.

02:00:43
<transcript>: But also.

02:00:43
<transcript>: choices

02:00:44
<transcript>: Choices.

02:00:50
<transcript>: Right.

02:00:56
<transcript>: Never mind that these are all fake. We're gonna fix that soon. I just want to get the shape of the API, right.

02:00:56
<transcript>: so

02:01:02
<transcript>: So the answer here is test. We have test two and test three is options. I guess we need four of them.

02:01:06
<transcript>: Okay. So those are choices.

02:01:08
<transcript>: Right.

02:01:13
<transcript>: And what's that mean? That means on the front end.

02:01:17
<transcript>: Not when we do new game we get a new round.

02:01:17
<transcript>: what am i

02:01:18
<transcript>: What am I trying to find.

02:01:21
<transcript>: Index.

02:01:29
<transcript>: Now does it just automatically look at that. Look how fast I didn't do anything. I didn't generate any code.

02:01:29
<transcript>: trpc

02:01:33
<transcript>: Trpc just said, the shape is this now.

02:01:39
<transcript>: I see the appeal, I see it, I see it.

02:01:39
<transcript>: you see it

02:01:43
<transcript>: You see it you see the appeal Name test.

02:01:46
<transcript>: Okay. So we get a new game.

02:01:46
<transcript>: this way

02:01:47
<transcript>: This way.

02:01:47
<transcript>: but

02:01:51
<transcript>: But we're not gonna use a sector. That's the bad way we're gonna do this.

02:01:54
<transcript>: We're gonna do this differently.

02:01:54
<transcript>: so let's

02:01:58
<transcript>: So let's do this. Let's yank that out.

02:02:00
<transcript>: Paste it here.

02:02:03
<transcript>: Let's get rid of this you fact.

02:02:03
<transcript>: and

02:02:05
<transcript>: And we're gonna do this.

02:02:05
<transcript>: differently

02:02:08
<transcript>: Differently. How are we gonna do this? We're going to have a button.

02:02:16
<transcript>: So first of all, let's come over here and refresh. Does that work? Shift. R. How do you refresh a page.

02:02:18
<transcript>: I don't know.

02:02:18
<transcript>: okay

02:02:21
<transcript>: Okay, we're gonna come over here and have a button.

02:02:28
stroopwafel26: cmd R

02:02:30
<transcript>: So at the bottom, let's see this is more like the the round like this view that we're looking at here is like you've already.

02:02:33
<transcript>: You're already in the middle of a game.

02:02:36
<transcript>: Let's delete inside that. Nope.

02:02:36
<transcript>: didn't work

02:02:39
<transcript>: Didn't work. Why did I think that would work.

02:02:42
<transcript>: Dip? Nope.

02:02:49
<transcript>: How could I delete between these brackets? I thought I could do I could do delete two there. Yeah, but I couldn't.

02:02:52
<transcript>: See? Yeah, Yeah.

02:02:55
<transcript>: It'll be guess.

02:03:02
<transcript>: Game.

02:03:07
cowfacedude99: dit is another option

02:03:07
<transcript>: The capitalization here is so awful.

02:03:07
<transcript>: let's

02:03:10
<transcript>: Let's do.

02:03:18
<transcript>: Let's do a pause. A pause? Where is that? A pause.

02:03:20
<transcript>: Everyone's favorite.

02:03:20
uberrick: &apos;

02:03:22
<transcript>: Aws.

02:03:25
<transcript>: Guessing.

02:03:25
<transcript>: game

02:03:26
<transcript>: Game okay.

02:03:28
ziindev: !neovim

02:03:30
<transcript>: Generated by.

02:03:32
<transcript>: Let's do this.

02:03:32
<transcript>: description

02:03:33
<transcript>: Description.

02:03:36
<transcript>: Tb.

02:03:36
<transcript>: okay

02:03:46
<transcript>: Okay. We're also gonna need a fave icon. We need somebody to get on that for me. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Just kidding. If you want to, if you want it to.

02:03:46
<transcript>: dit is

02:03:50
<transcript>: Dit is another option. Okay, so I could have done dit.

02:03:55
<transcript>: ditch

02:03:56
<transcript>: Ditch.

02:04:05
stroopwafel26: need the favicon on my desk on friday

02:04:07
<transcript>: Oh definitely should be shareable and that's a good call on social media. Thank you, Kabiddi. We're definitely gonna make it shareable on social media. Think the AWS community on Twitter is gonna love this.

02:04:09
<transcript>: All 30 of us.

02:04:14
<transcript>: Yeah, I need to know my desk on Friday. Thank you.

02:04:21
<transcript>: Zylin Dev my NeoVM configuration lives.

02:04:21
<transcript>: here

02:04:22
<transcript>: Here.

02:04:26
<transcript>: My commands are down today. I'm so sorry, everyone but.

02:04:26
<transcript>: you can find

02:04:27
adamdotdev: github.com/adamelmore/dotfiles

02:04:31
<transcript>: You can find my new Vim Config in my Dot files, right there.

02:04:31
<transcript>: think

02:04:39
<transcript>: Think I also have an Inv repo up there still, but it's no longer up to date. My new of income big lives in my dot files now.

02:04:39
<transcript>: reset

02:04:40
<transcript>: Reset development.

02:04:44
<transcript>: Okay, so we're gonna have a button.

02:04:48
<transcript>: This is like our so we said this view is more like.

02:04:52
<transcript>: Let's make a component actually.

02:04:54
<transcript>: Components directory.

02:04:54
<transcript>: source

02:05:02
<transcript>: Source pages, styles type utils. I guess we don't have a component directory. Do I want a component directory.

02:05:10
<transcript>: No, let's just keep it in here, but we will split it out into a component down here. So we're gonna have.

02:05:10
<transcript>: const

02:05:11
<transcript>: Const.

02:05:14
<transcript>: Gameview round.

02:05:14
<transcript>: round

02:05:16
<transcript>: Round, round.

02:05:21
<transcript>: View do I in components with view.

02:05:21
<transcript>: now

02:05:23
<transcript>: Now round.

02:05:27
<transcript>: Const round it's just around. How about that.

02:05:29
<transcript>: And it's gonna be like this.

02:05:33
<transcript>: Kind of just take this whole.

02:05:33
<transcript>: main

02:05:34
<transcript>: Main.

02:05:36
<transcript>: Thing.

02:05:43
<transcript>: So if I wanted to select this paragraph or yank this paragraph, could I do like Yap.

02:05:45
<transcript>: Yeah I could.

02:05:51
<transcript>: Dap it weapped it didn't quite work, but we almost got it.

02:05:53
<transcript>: Yapped.

02:05:59
<transcript>: Why? Why did that do that? Okay. Well, we were close.

02:05:59
<transcript>: we're gonna

02:06:03
<transcript>: We're gonna change this to be a Div.

02:06:10
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the followers, Timmy. And Laughter slaster I like saying your name Laster's Laster.

02:06:10
<transcript>: that's just

02:06:12
<transcript>: That's just fun to say.

02:06:20
<transcript>: I'm gonna need you to do more things last or slaster like talk and chat. So I'm like, welcome to chat. Laster slasher. I just need excuses. Same name. Because that's a pretty cool name.

02:06:20
<transcript>: so

02:06:21
stroopwafel26: oh hey you have new dotfiles

02:06:28
<transcript>: So we're gonna make this a Div. How would I rename a tag? Looks like this, but I use invent surround.

02:06:30
lasterslaster: thx!

02:06:33
<transcript>: Would I just do something that's built into them phone or rename this tag.

02:06:40
<transcript>: I could just do this. I could just say Div, and then come down here.

02:06:40
<transcript>: and dot it

02:06:45
<transcript>: And dot it. I could just do that. I just feel like there's probably a cooler way to do it, you know.

02:06:46
<transcript>: Probably.

02:06:48
<transcript>: So random.

02:06:50
<transcript>: Component.

02:06:58
<transcript>: And it's going to take in a round, which is a round.

02:06:58
<transcript>: can i do that

02:06:59
<transcript>: Can I do that.

02:07:03
<transcript>: Does this type exist anywhere.

02:07:03
<transcript>: in trpc

02:07:05
<transcript>: In TRPC land.

02:07:07
<transcript>: No.

02:07:18
<transcript>: I'm saying I want to say, like, what are my tier PC types? How do I work with them? What I want it to be is the type from the thing.

02:07:21
<transcript>: So this.

02:07:21
<transcript>: type of this thing

02:07:25
<transcript>: Type of this thing. I want that type. How do I get that type.

02:07:25
<transcript>: you know

02:07:26
<transcript>: You know.

02:07:29
<transcript>: Last year's. Last year. Welcome to chat.

02:07:37
<transcript>: Yes, Troop. I do have new Dot files. I published them on Friday before I left for vacation.

02:07:49
<transcript>: I'm going to, oh, my Zsh. I'm not quite done with my own my Zsh setup, but I just simplified the dot files a lot. I'm using Stow.

02:07:49
<transcript>: just do

02:07:51
<transcript>: Just do the SIM links.

02:07:56
<transcript>: So what's wrong here? Round. I need to type.

02:07:56
<transcript>: let's just ignore

02:08:02
<transcript>: Let's just ignore the typewrite for a moment. Well, I can't ignore inside this the next thing I need, I need the type of around.

02:08:07
<transcript>: Do we get types in PrPC.

02:08:07
<transcript>: here pc

02:08:08
<transcript>: Here, PC.

02:08:11
stroopwafel26: github is having issues, lots of errors everywhere

02:08:14
<transcript>: Use generated types. They're not really generated, are they.

02:08:17
<transcript>: How do I get the types.

02:08:21
<transcript>: That's a good slogan. Move fast and break nothing.

02:08:24
<transcript>: Lots of errors on GitHub. I.

02:08:26
<transcript>: 'll.

02:08:26
<transcript>: feel

02:08:45
<transcript>: Feel like I should say, Timmy, your name is great too. You know, I welcomed you and Last or Slasher at the same time. And I really made a deal about Laughter Slasher's name. But Timmy's a great name. That's maybe your real name. Maybe your name is Timmy. There's nothing wrong with that name. It's a fine name.

02:08:45
<transcript>: you

02:08:48
<transcript>: You just came in with laughter, slasher and that's.

02:08:48
<transcript>: that's a

02:08:55
iamaflex: !font

02:08:57
<transcript>: That's a really good name. It's just really fun to say I wouldn't probably name my kid last or slaster, but it's a fun name to say so.

02:08:57
<transcript>: there's nothing wrong

02:09:02
<transcript>: There's nothing wrong with your name. Just feel like I should clarify. Crpc allows you to easily build and consume.

02:09:10
<transcript>: I want the types. How do I work with the types? I'm using version nine old busted.

02:09:17
doro24: @iamaflex Operator Mono

02:09:18
<transcript>: Few examples.

02:09:18
<transcript>: quick

02:09:20
<transcript>: Quick start.

02:09:23
<transcript>: Highly encourage you to check out the example apps.

02:09:27
<transcript>: So I want to.

02:09:33
<transcript>: Create a router at a query endpoint.

02:09:33
<transcript>: you take

02:09:34
<transcript>: You take.

02:09:40
<transcript>: Okay. Clients. I should have done. Client side. Maybe.

02:09:44
<transcript>: Create TRPC hooks.

02:09:55
<transcript>: I guess all this is done for us with T three stack.

02:10:00
<transcript>: Yes, welcome to Chat. I am a flex.

02:10:00
<transcript>: and

02:10:05
<transcript>: And Doro. And thanks for answering the question. It is our operator mono. That's correct.

02:10:13
<transcript>: Make API requests. So here I want the type of that thing. Where do I get types.

02:10:16
<transcript>: Response main.

02:10:17
<transcript>: mainact

02:10:18
<transcript>: Mainact.

02:10:20
<transcript>: Okay.

02:10:22
<transcript>: Hooks.

02:10:28
<transcript>: From Util. Prpc.

02:10:30
<transcript>: Use query.

02:10:35
<transcript>: Anybody. Now do I just need to define the type myself.

02:10:38
<transcript>: This feels like I shouldn't have to do that.

02:10:40
<transcript>: But I could just define.

02:10:45
<transcript>: Just say like type round.

02:10:45
<transcript>: has

02:10:46
<transcript>: Has.

02:10:46
<transcript>: id

02:10:48
<transcript>: Id.

02:10:49
<transcript>: String.

02:11:01
<transcript>: Id is a string, and it has a answer which is a string, and it has.

02:11:05
<transcript>: Choices which is a string array.

02:11:05
<transcript>: right

02:11:08
<transcript>: Right. We could just do this.

02:11:10
<transcript>: Feels bad. That's all.

02:11:11
<transcript>: That's all.

02:11:15
<transcript>: The little bad when I want to just say.

02:11:18
<transcript>: Get that type from my back end.

02:11:26
<transcript>: Okay. So we have the round. We pass it into this component. Here.

02:11:34
<transcript>: And is that everything we needed? Answer choices? Yeah. So up here now I can say we're gonna.

02:11:34
<transcript>: do

02:11:37
<transcript>: Do a CA.

02:11:38
<transcript>: cake

02:11:40
stroopwafel26: Ah I see how stow works now, you have to set up your dotfiles repo exactly like you would setup your home directory and it does things automatically, cool

02:11:45
<transcript>: Cake cap. So that doesn't quite get if I do like that.

02:11:45
<transcript>: delete

02:11:47
<transcript>: Delete all of.

02:11:47
<transcript>: the

02:11:48
<transcript>: The paragraph.

02:11:57
<transcript>: The tag. Is that what I was DAP is too much. That is just enough. What does T stand for.

02:11:57
<transcript>: so if i

02:11:58
<transcript>: So if I'm gonna do.

02:12:01
<transcript>: Sat cat.

02:12:07
<transcript>: My first my gut was sat.

02:12:07
<transcript>: no

02:12:17
<transcript>: No, that was probably the cat. So I'm gonna do cat. I'm gonna be replying that tag. Yeah, just like that round. Round equals around.

02:12:17
<transcript>: round

02:12:18
<transcript>: Round.

02:12:18
<transcript>: round

02:12:21
<transcript>: Round, round, round, round somebody around.

02:12:29
<transcript>: You have set up your dot piles repo exactly like you would set up your home directory. And it does things automatically. That is exactly right. Stroop.

02:12:29
<transcript>: so seems

02:12:31
stroopwafel26: Not sure I'd use that personally because I want to be able to run a script without any external dependencies

02:12:32
<transcript>: So seems pretty great GNU Stow.

02:12:42
<transcript>: All right. So we we put that thing the round. So now if we don't want to show around right off the bat.

02:12:42
<transcript>: we can

02:12:45
<transcript>: We can instead show a big button.

02:12:45
<transcript>: and

02:12:48
<transcript>: And what is this button gonna look like.

02:12:48
<transcript>: it's gonna

02:12:56
<transcript>: It's gonna, we should make a button component, because these styles are gonna get old, so let's do that. Let's yank.

02:12:58
stroopwafel26: Like taking out a new MacBook out the box, run a script and that's it :P

02:13:02
<transcript>: The yank the button? I'm gonna do Yak no, Yeah.

02:13:02
<transcript>: yank

02:13:08
<transcript>: Yank all of Tea's for tag. Maybe. I don't know.

02:13:10
<transcript>: Top button.

02:13:12
<transcript>: Is a real.

02:13:16
<transcript>: Html.

02:13:16
<transcript>: what is it

02:13:17
<transcript>: What is it.

02:13:17
<transcript>: component

02:13:20
<transcript>: Component props.

02:13:24
<transcript>: React component props.

02:13:27
<transcript>: Buttons like that.

02:13:34
<transcript>: Thing.

02:13:37
<transcript>: Oh, what choice.

02:13:37
<transcript>: now just

02:13:39
<transcript>: Now just do this.

02:13:41
<transcript>: We'll just do this.

02:13:43
<transcript>: Children.

02:13:46
<transcript>: Excuse me.

02:13:50
<transcript>: Like this? We're gonna say.

02:13:50
<transcript>: children

02:13:51
<transcript>: Children.

02:13:51
<transcript>: and

02:13:54
<transcript>: And the rest are props. That's how you do it.

02:13:59
<transcript>: Forgot so many things.

02:14:06
<transcript>: Should be in should be in like a thing.

02:14:09
<transcript>: To be in like a thing. Just like this.

02:14:15
<transcript>: And then we're gonna do props like this.

02:14:20
<transcript>: I remember how to write JavaScript Yay.

02:14:25
<transcript>: There was some serious doubt. What's the what's? The thing.

02:14:30
<transcript>: Xgu button is the Claire was values now he's never used.

02:14:30
<transcript>: okay

02:14:32
<transcript>: Okay, we're gonna fix that real soon.

02:14:39
<transcript>: Okay so round has some buttons children is used.

02:14:39
<transcript>: these children

02:14:42
<transcript>: These children. Right there, right.

02:14:42
<transcript>: that's not

02:14:44
<transcript>: That's not the problem.

02:14:44
<transcript>: we're just

02:14:50
<transcript>: We're just trying to override the class names. I guess I should also include I guess I'll do this.

02:14:54
<transcript>: Let them pass in a class name as well.

02:14:59
<transcript>: Say them. It's me. I'll let me do this.

02:15:05
<transcript>: Maybe.

02:15:15
<transcript>: Computer property must be of type. What.

02:15:15
<transcript>: string numbers

02:15:18
<transcript>: String, numbers, symbol or any that's what class name is.

02:15:21
<transcript>: Oh, it's only a class name.

02:15:21
<transcript>: exists

02:15:23
<transcript>: Exists.

02:15:23
<transcript>: well that's what

02:15:27
<transcript>: Well, that's what this is about. I guess I have to do, like.

02:15:27
<transcript>: what are

02:15:30
<transcript>: What are you doing? This case. I always do a thing. What do I do.

02:15:38
<transcript>: I guess I.

02:15:41
<transcript>: Default it to.

02:15:41
<transcript>: that

02:15:42
<transcript>: That.

02:15:45
<transcript>: Feels kind of weird.

02:15:47
<transcript>: But I think that'll work.

02:15:52
<transcript>: Great. What's usually a button. So here we're gonna do cap.

02:15:55
<transcript>: And we're gonna do button.

02:16:00
<transcript>: Key.

02:16:04
<transcript>: And then.

02:16:06
<transcript>: Toys.

02:16:08
<transcript>: Like that.

02:16:10
<transcript>: Oh.

02:16:13
<transcript>: Does that work.

02:16:16
<transcript>: Let's see.

02:16:19
<transcript>: Yeah, it worked. Okay.

02:16:28
<transcript>: So that's our round. That's our button. Now we're gonna have a button that's, like, new game. We're gonna come up with a logo. We got all kinds of stuff to do.

02:16:28
<transcript>: button

02:16:31
<transcript>: Button new game.

02:16:36
<transcript>: Let's center it.

02:16:39
<transcript>: So let's say.

02:16:39
<transcript>: main

02:16:40
<transcript>: Main.

02:16:47
<transcript>: There and then.

02:16:50
<transcript>: Class name.

02:16:50
<transcript>: flex

02:16:55
<transcript>: Flex Flex Call Item Center item.

02:16:55
<transcript>: justifies

02:16:59
<transcript>: Justifies something justifies Center.

02:17:02
<transcript>: That now.

02:17:06
<transcript>: Height. Let me say, like Heightful or something.

02:17:11
<transcript>: What I need to do here? What do I need to do.

02:17:21
<transcript>: I want to be able to run a script without any external dependencies. That's good call Stroop I do have to install.

02:17:23
<transcript>: So first.

02:17:29
<transcript>: I've been thinking about getting a MacBook.

02:17:32
<transcript>: I'm gonna be going to reinvent in Vegas.

02:17:32
<transcript>: in a couple

02:17:34
<transcript>: In a couple months.

02:17:34
<transcript>: i thought

02:17:43
<transcript>: I thought, Am I realistically gonna go somewhere for a week and not have a computer with me? Probably not. Should probably have a laptop for that.

02:17:46
<transcript>: So I might get.

02:17:46
<transcript>: a new macbook

02:17:51
<transcript>: A new MacBook, which means I'll have to actually set up a new machine, and I haven't done that in a while. It's been.

02:17:51
<transcript>: a bit

02:17:53
<transcript>: A bit.

02:17:53
<transcript>: so if i want to

02:17:55
<transcript>: So if I want to make this whole thing.

02:17:56
stroopwafel26: I can recommend a MacBook Air

02:17:58
<transcript>: Full height? What would I do? Like.

02:17:58
<transcript>: oh

02:17:59
<transcript>: Oh.

02:18:06
<transcript>: I want to say height.

02:18:08
<transcript>: Full.

02:18:12
<transcript>: Massage.

02:18:22
<transcript>: That kind of works. Feels like a hack. We'll come back to it.

02:18:22
<transcript>: okay

02:18:26
<transcript>: Okay. So here's our button. New game.

02:18:28
<transcript>: And.

02:18:28
<transcript>: we're gonna

02:18:30
<transcript>: We're gonna have an onclick.

02:18:36
<transcript>: On click.

02:18:42
<transcript>: Handle new game.

02:18:47
<transcript>: Handle.

02:18:51
<transcript>: Okay.

02:18:51
<transcript>: so we click

02:18:55
<transcript>: So we click the button. We call our new game mode. Mutation.

02:18:55
<transcript>: i don't know why

02:18:58
<transcript>: I don't know why games have a name. I feel like they don't need a name.

02:19:06
<transcript>: You can recommend a MacBook error. Can I do all the things I want to do on a MacBook Air versus a MacBook pro.

02:19:16
<transcript>: I just assumed MacBook Pro. I've owned a few MacBook Pros in my day back when I used to travel.

02:19:20
stroopwafel26: M2 MacBook Air is more than capable

02:19:20
madlep: depends what you want to do

02:19:22
schrew: MacBook Airs are easier to throw when frustrated

02:19:23
<transcript>: But if MacBook airs are as good as MacBook Pros and I guess I don't I guess I should get the smaller one.

02:19:23
<transcript>: and

02:19:33
<transcript>: And what you want to do? What if I want to stream on Vegas? What if I want to pull up Twitch and say Hello to all of you while I'm in Vegas? Can I stream on a MacBook air.

02:19:43
stroopwafel26: yeah

02:19:44
madlep: people do it on worse

02:19:44
<transcript>: So handle the game, we get a response. We're gonna leave the name in there for now, I guess, but I don't know if it's kind of weird.

02:19:44
<transcript>: respons

02:19:47
<transcript>: Response we're gonna say.

02:19:52
uberrick: yeah M chips have made the MB Air viable

02:19:53
<transcript>: Start a new round. So we're gonna show the round. Now let's have a Const.

02:19:53
<transcript>: current

02:19:56
<transcript>: Current round.

02:19:56
<transcript>: set current

02:19:57
<transcript>: Set current.

02:20:01
<transcript>: Equals react.

02:20:01
<transcript>: use state

02:20:03
<transcript>: Use state.

02:20:06
<transcript>: It's gonna be.

02:20:07
<transcript>: Type.

02:20:08
stroopwafel26: I do all the things on an M1 Air

02:20:09
<transcript>: There's gonna be a type of.

02:20:13
<transcript>: How do I get the type of new name mutation.

02:20:13
<transcript>: it's that

02:20:18
<transcript>: It's that type. No, it's a round. We already defined a round type, didn't we.

02:20:20
<transcript>: Okay.

02:20:21
tayloreddev: if I can stream on a 2013 MacBook Pro a new MacBook air will be fine

02:20:26
<transcript>: So currently round we're gonna.

02:20:26
<transcript>: set

02:20:27
<transcript>: Set.

02:20:34
<transcript>: How to them.

02:20:38
<transcript>: Set the current round.

02:20:40
<transcript>: Response.

02:20:45
<transcript>: Did I remove my.

02:20:49
<transcript>: Neck. There we go.

02:20:49
<transcript>: okay

02:20:55
<transcript>: Okay. So now we're gonna set current round and this thing right here is gonna be.

02:21:01
<transcript>: I want to surround this? I'm gonna do invent surround? I gotta start practicing. So if I want to.

02:21:04
<transcript>: If I want to do invent.

02:21:12
<transcript>: Cs no YS would be a new surround some surrounding this thing with a new tag, right.

02:21:23
<transcript>: No, I said Y S Y s.

02:21:23
<transcript>: around

02:21:25
<transcript>: Around.

02:21:27
<transcript>: The tag.

02:21:33
<transcript>: I did some stuff.

02:21:33
<transcript>: but

02:21:34
<transcript>: But these on both sides.

02:21:37
<transcript>: But not what I'm looking for.

02:21:40
<transcript>: Cs? No? Y? S.

02:21:40
<transcript>: a

02:21:42
<transcript>: A.

02:21:42
<transcript>: t

02:21:45
<transcript>: T. And then the tag is addressed through T for tag.

02:21:47
<transcript>: So.

02:21:47
<transcript>: ys

02:21:49
<transcript>: Ysat.

02:22:08
<transcript>: If I can stream on a 2013 MacBook Pro, a new MacBook error will be fine. Okay, that makes sense.

02:22:13
<transcript>: So the MacBook Air is just smaller, slightly less powerful.

02:22:13
<transcript>: i want

02:22:15
<transcript>: I want to invent around this.

02:22:15
<transcript>: i guess

02:22:19
<transcript>: I guess Where's my YS.

02:22:29
<transcript>: What's that thing that pops up and like says, here's the next keys you can press for your commands. Thanks so much for the Follow Cap mode. I appreciate that. Follow.

02:22:29
<transcript>: ys

02:22:31
<transcript>: Ys? Oop Nope.

02:22:31
<transcript>: ys

02:22:34
<transcript>: Ysa.

02:22:37
<transcript>: Okay, I'm looking it up.

02:22:37
<transcript>: inv

02:22:38
<transcript>: Inv.

02:22:40
catmodev: :) hi!

02:22:45
laytanl_: which-key

02:22:50
<transcript>: Follow. Take. Pad.

02:22:58
<transcript>: Which key? Yeah. Which key? I have that running right. Laden. I thought Katna Devil, welcome to Chat. Hi, how are you.

02:23:00
<transcript>: Doing all right.

02:23:09
<transcript>: Yes, we code. Yes, we do. Thank you so much for the follow help at the low level. Okay, so, YSV what's the capital V stand for.

02:23:09
<transcript>: order to your

02:23:12
laytanl_: I don't know if you got that

02:23:16
<transcript>: Order to your goal, you need to force a linewise motion by adding a capital V between the operator YS and the motion a T.

02:23:18
<transcript>: Okay.

02:23:21
stroopwafel26: pretty the Any key

02:23:25
stroopwafel26: press

02:23:32
<transcript>: And then Div. Then just start typing Div and then character turn. So if I'm here and I just do I don't think I need the V. I think.

02:23:32
<transcript>: why

02:23:33
<transcript>: Why, fat.

02:23:33
<transcript>: then start typing

02:23:35
<transcript>: Then start typing. Div.

02:23:37
<transcript>: divad

02:23:40
<transcript>: Divad. So not what I'm looking for.

02:23:42
catmodev: tryin to work but stumble on your channel and it hooked me.... :)

02:23:50
<transcript>: Is inventround working. Do I have inventor round? Let's open up our dot files, let's detach. Let's team up.

02:23:57
<transcript>: A and let's do our default. So I've got my DA files over here.

02:23:57
<transcript>: yeah

02:23:59
catmodev: now I wanna learn vim

02:23:59
<transcript>: Yeah? And vim dot.

02:23:59
<transcript>: let's zoom

02:24:01
<transcript>: Let's Zoom it.

02:24:01
<transcript>: let's open

02:24:03
<transcript>: Let's open up.

02:24:03
<transcript>: my

02:24:06
<transcript>: My inventory config.

02:24:09
<transcript>: We're looking for in them surround.

02:24:16
<transcript>: Right here.

02:24:17
<transcript>: Okay.

02:24:22
<transcript>: Where did I put all the Surround stuff? I don't have my.

02:24:26
<transcript>: Telescope's not working in my dot files right now because.

02:24:26
<transcript>: dot config

02:24:28
<transcript>: Dot. Config. Is hidden.

02:24:32
<transcript>: Gotta figure out how to fix that. Maybe it's in here.

02:24:35
<transcript>: Maybe it's in here. File ignore patterns.

02:24:38
<transcript>: Get.

02:24:40
<transcript>: Node, modules.

02:24:44
<transcript>: I do want to show.

02:24:47
<transcript>: App config.

02:24:47
<transcript>: you know

02:24:48
<transcript>: You know.

02:24:50
<transcript>: We want to show that.

02:24:51
madlep: I have any key bound to leader in vim for efficiency

02:24:54
<transcript>: Let's go into.

02:24:54
<transcript>: let's

02:24:56
<transcript>: Let's see. Matt.

02:25:00
<transcript>: Looking for invent surround stuff.

02:25:03
<transcript>: I'm. Tree Telescope comment.

02:25:11
<transcript>: Okay. None of those. We're all else. Would I put it.

02:25:14
<transcript>: Plugins.

02:25:14
<transcript>: theme

02:25:16
<transcript>: Theme.

02:25:16
<transcript>: now

02:25:18
<transcript>: Now that would make it easier.

02:25:23
<transcript>: Built in. I'm just using the builtin in VIMS round. I'm not using anything custom, I guess.

02:25:25
<transcript>: Let's look at it.

02:25:25
<transcript>: in vim

02:25:28
<transcript>: In vim. Surround in them surround.

02:25:31
uberrick: have you got find grep setup?

02:25:34
<transcript>: Press the Innie. Key.

02:25:44
<transcript>: Trying to work but stumble on your channel and it hooked me. I'm hooked you, Camo. That's so great to hear? Well, you can work while you.

02:25:44
<transcript>: while you

02:25:48
<transcript>: While you watch or why you listen. A lot of people say you can Cowork.

02:25:48
<transcript>: so

02:25:55
<transcript>: So you just listen to me while you work. Like, instead of listen to music. Oh, normally I play music. Let's play music.

02:25:58
schrew: I do be coworking

02:26:02
<transcript>: Find Grip Setup if you got fined grep.

02:26:03
catmodev: that's what I am doing ... lol

02:26:09
<transcript>: I do be coworking. Alright. That's what you're doing now.

02:26:09
<transcript>: welcome

02:26:13
<transcript>: Welcome. Hope you like Rufus Wayne, right. I play a lot of old Jake.

02:26:13
<transcript>: i'll take some

02:26:17
<transcript>: I'll take some requests if anyone has any music requests.

02:26:17
<transcript>: you're coworking

02:26:19
<transcript>: You're coworking day.

02:26:22
<transcript>: So inventor round. What do we need here.

02:26:25
<transcript>: This one.

02:26:29
<transcript>: Oh Surround envelope versus Inv.

02:26:37
<transcript>: Tag.

02:26:37
<transcript>: we're about to

02:26:39
<transcript>: We're about to learn how to do that.

02:26:41
catmodev: noice....somthing lo-fi to smoth thigs....but your pick is awesome

02:26:42
<transcript>: Surround words.

02:26:48
<transcript>: Oh, yeah? I have to say what I want to surround? So, like.

02:26:48
<transcript>: t is

02:26:52
<transcript>: T is for tag. Is that what T is for.

02:26:56
<transcript>: So CS th one.

02:26:59
<transcript>: Or tagged types.

02:27:03
<transcript>: So that's other changing a tag.

02:27:03
<transcript>: but

02:27:06
<transcript>: But we want to add a tag.

02:27:08
<transcript>: Right.

02:27:13
<transcript>: Okay, let's go back to our team X.

02:27:13
<transcript>: a

02:27:15
<transcript>: A to B.

02:27:25
<transcript>: Something low Fi does sound nice.

02:27:25
<transcript>: something

02:27:29
nikolarhristov: :D

02:27:32
<transcript>: Something lofi. I'm just gonna listen to loaf. I could probably listen to something. It's actually DMCA whatever.

02:27:32
<transcript>: copyright

02:27:34
<transcript>: Copyright free or whatever.

02:27:48
<transcript>: Let's learn how to surround this tag first and then we'll take a look. So I want to surround round here with a actually with Bracket. I don't even want to use a tag. I just want to watch.

02:27:50
<transcript>: At.

02:27:59
<transcript>: Nanana.

02:28:03
<transcript>: But CS 80 now. Oh, into the owl. Okay.

02:28:07
<transcript>: So that works.

02:28:07
<transcript>: kind of

02:28:08
<transcript>: Kind of.

02:28:08
<transcript>: it changed

02:28:10
<transcript>: It changed the tag.

02:28:12
<transcript>: What did it do.

02:28:17
<transcript>: All right. My inventory on usage is terrible. Let's just move on for now.

02:28:17
<transcript>: we get

02:28:19
<transcript>: We get better at that.

02:28:24
<transcript>: So I'm gonna say if current round.

02:28:27
<transcript>: Gonna do this.

02:28:33
<transcript>: Round. Okay. So now we set the current round here when we create one.

02:28:38
<transcript>: Because the response has all of that on it.

02:28:42
<transcript>: I guess round we should put a game ID on this type.

02:28:46
<transcript>: We're gonna need that in a second.

02:28:46
<transcript>: when we actually

02:28:49
<transcript>: When we actually start submitting answers, right. Okay.

02:28:49
<transcript>: so let's

02:28:53
<transcript>: So let's do it. Let's see if we click new game.

02:29:00
<transcript>: Did I do it? Did I click the new game? Oh, I did. We just didn't hide the original.

02:29:03
<transcript>: Yeah, we got some work to do.

02:29:08
<transcript>: So this is only gonna be displayed if there's no current game.

02:29:10
<transcript>: Currently.

02:29:14
<transcript>: There's no current round. We'll display this thing. The button.

02:29:14
<transcript>: else

02:29:16
<transcript>: Else.

02:29:24
<transcript>: Current round.

02:29:33
<transcript>: Right.

02:29:34
catmodev: ? bootstrap or tailwind?

02:29:38
<transcript>: One way to do it.

02:29:51
<transcript>: Okay. And there's no logo because we returned bogus data, right. And these were our options that we provided test 1234. Okay. This is tailwind capno.

02:29:57
<transcript>: All right, I'm kind of overroof this.

02:29:59
uberrick: for moving a line up and down a line what are you pressing? I need that

02:30:01
<transcript>: Kind of over it.

02:30:01
<transcript>: although we didn't even

02:30:03
<transcript>: Although we didn't even get into the real hits.

02:30:08
<transcript>: The real good roof is stuff.

02:30:13
<transcript>: Like cigarettes and chocolate milk. And that's just a classic.

02:30:13
uberrick: @CatmoDev tailwind

02:30:17
<transcript>: We're gonna place an old Rufus stuff.

02:30:17
<transcript>: he's just done so

02:30:21
<transcript>: He's just done so much work. He's written so much music.

02:30:26
<transcript>: For moving a line. Up and down line. What are you pressing? I need that. Yeah, I.

02:30:33
<transcript>: Had this in vs. Code and like I had a shortcut for just moving the line up and down and I wanted it. So I made a key behind it's.

02:30:33
<transcript>: a leader

02:30:38
<transcript>: A leader J and leader K? So leader Jay moves down? Leader K moves up.

02:30:42
<transcript>: I don't know. Does anyone mapped Leader Jay in the Leader K to anything.

02:30:42
<transcript>: that made sense

02:30:44
<transcript>: That made sense to me.

02:30:46
<transcript>: Also.

02:30:46
<transcript>: i created like a

02:30:48
<transcript>: I created like a copy.

02:30:48
<transcript>: so

02:30:51
<transcript>: So Leader L copies, lines.

02:30:54
uberrick: Nice that looks good

02:30:57
<transcript>: I don't know if anyone does that either, but I like it sometimes I just want to copy some wines, you know.

02:30:59
<transcript>: Okay.

02:31:02
<transcript>: New game.

02:31:12
<transcript>: New game. And then, okay, let's do real beta. Let's do some real.

02:31:19
<transcript>: Okay. So here we're just returning bogus stuff instead.

02:31:19
<transcript>: we're gonna actually

02:31:24
<transcript>: We're gonna actually we need to start doing real stuff. So our anti come from.

02:31:24
<transcript>: how

02:31:29
<transcript>: How are we gonna do this? We're gonna say, what if we just had a big map.

02:31:31
<transcript>: Const.

02:31:31
<transcript>: constourses

02:31:37
<transcript>: Constourses. These are like AWS resources. Right? And what if we had, like, DynamoDB.

02:31:46
<transcript>: I keep doing fake stuff. Let's do less fake stuff. So let's look in our directory. Here. We have this Public Images directory.

02:31:46
<transcript>: we have

02:31:48
<transcript>: We have these hashed.

02:31:51
<transcript>: Hashed, images.

02:31:51
<transcript>: we have

02:31:54
<transcript>: We have the originals which this source.

02:31:59
<transcript>: Serves as our sort of source of truth, if you will. These are our.

02:31:59
<transcript>: all

02:32:02
<transcript>: All the services that we have icons for.

02:32:04
madlep: moving lines up/down I have these keybinds set up so up/down arrows move a line or a block of text up/down

02:32:05
madlep: -- Move text up and down keymap("n", "<Up>", ":m .-2<CR>", opts) keymap("n", "<Down>", ":m .+1<CR>", opts) keymap("v", "<Up>", ":m .-2<CR>", opts) keymap("v", "<Down>", ":m .+1<CR>", opts) keymap("v", "p", '"_dP', opts) keymap("x", "<Up>", ":move '<-2<CR>gv-gv", opts) keymap("x", "<Down>", ":move '>+1<CR>gv-gv", opts)

02:32:07
<transcript>: So, API Gateway App Flow Application and they start with these are Amazon or a us.

02:32:11
<transcript>: Oh, what's going here.

02:32:20
<transcript>: Now we're pasting in key mats and chat.

02:32:23
<transcript>: Okay. So the original.

02:32:30
<transcript>: I need to build up a map based on all these file names.

02:32:36
<transcript>: Or I need to read them. We just read them from the yeah, yeah. I don't need a Yeah.

02:32:40
madlep: that did not go how I though tit would... thanks twitch MaxLOL

02:32:45
<transcript>: This is what we're gonna do, okay? It's all making sense. But first I got a P. I got a pee so bad I'm dancing, so I'll be right back.

02:36:41
<transcript>: So as I was watching my hands.

02:36:47
<transcript>: I noticed in the mirror. I have this ear hair. It's giant. It's so long.

02:36:52
<transcript>: That's the one thing I've noticed. Like all of the aging tropes. Like.

02:36:52
<transcript>: stiff

02:37:06
<transcript>: Stiff back and like, can't move. I'm getting old. None of that has been true for me. Like none of it. But my ear hair grows like crazy. I don't understand it, but I'm so glad I wear headphones so they're not just like, glistening on camera.

02:37:06
<transcript>: my four k

02:37:10
<transcript>: My 4K cameras picking up all my ear. Thank you so much for the follow vascoff.

02:37:13
<transcript>: Appreciate the follow.

02:37:18
<transcript>: Even after you learned I have really long ear hair. I mean relatively long like for an ear hair.

02:37:18
<transcript>: right

02:37:20
<transcript>: Right? Not like.

02:37:22
<transcript>: My head, hair.

02:37:22
<transcript>: i've got

02:37:29
<transcript>: I've got a haircut on Monday, but I'm sorry the next three days you all are gonna have to look at whatever this is I've got going on.

02:37:29
<transcript>: it's a lot of

02:37:31
<transcript>: It's a lot of hair.

02:37:36
<transcript>: Thank you. 1916 Eco. Thank you for Davolo. Thank you so much.

02:37:39
<transcript>: So what are we doing? We're building a debug guest.

02:37:39
<transcript>: having

02:37:41
<transcript>: Having a pretty good time doing it.

02:37:44
<transcript>: I'm gonna go back to it now.

02:37:50
andreull: man, I noticed that too. I got anxious... I'm ageing noooo

02:37:52
<transcript>: All right.

02:37:52
<transcript>: so we've got

02:37:57
<transcript>: So we've got this list of AWS services. We're using the images.

02:37:57
<transcript>: as our

02:38:03
<transcript>: As our source of truth. So we have these SDGs for each of the logos. We did that like the first day.

02:38:12
<transcript>: Oh, no, Andre, you're aging too well, we're all aging. It's okay. It turns out that we all are.

02:38:12
<transcript>: if i want

02:38:21
<transcript>: If I want to load this from the disc, I'm just gonna do it. I'm just gonna say import like this. This feels bad, but I don't know.

02:38:21
<transcript>: why can't i do this

02:38:22
<transcript>: Why can't I do this.

02:38:24
<transcript>: I was gonna say.

02:38:27
<transcript>: So resources.

02:38:30
<transcript>: Is now gonna be.

02:38:36
<transcript>: I want to cap no cat? C.

02:38:39
<transcript>: Tap? Nope.

02:38:43
<transcript>: Nope. I'm just gonna delete the thing.

02:38:43
<transcript>: just like that and i

02:38:45
<transcript>: Just like that. And I'm gonna redo it. So.

02:38:45
<transcript>: resources

02:38:49
<transcript>: Resources equals FS. Read.

02:38:50
<transcript>: reader sync

02:38:51
<transcript>: Reader, sync.

02:38:54
<transcript>: Readersink.

02:39:00
<transcript>: What else I'm gonna say? I'm gonna pass it a pass, so it's gonna be public.

02:39:02
<transcript>: Images.

02:39:02
<transcript>: origin

02:39:08
<transcript>: Original. I think just the path. So I'm gonna read that directory.

02:39:09
<transcript>: Right.

02:39:14
<transcript>: So all the file names in that directory, here.

02:39:14
<transcript>: there's a bunch

02:39:16
<transcript>: There's a bunch of them.

02:39:16
<transcript>: i'm gonna be going

02:39:18
<transcript>: I'm gonna be going up for a while.

02:39:18
<transcript>: page up

02:39:20
<transcript>: Page, up, page, that page, up.

02:39:20
<transcript>: there

02:39:28
<transcript>: There. Okay. So all these file names, the these would be what I'm trying to read. Public Images original. Okay.

02:39:33
<transcript>: And I'm just getting the filename. So that's kind of perfect.

02:39:37
<transcript>: So for each of those resources, I want to.

02:39:39
<transcript>: Map.

02:39:41
<transcript>: So file name.

02:39:44
<transcript>: I want to return file number.

02:39:50
<transcript>: To pass that parse.

02:39:52
<transcript>: Filame.

02:39:52
<transcript>: name

02:39:53
<transcript>: Name.

02:39:56
<transcript>: I've got import pass right.

02:40:02
<transcript>: There we go.

02:40:05
<transcript>: Important path. Yeah. Okay.

02:40:05
<transcript>: outside

02:40:06
<transcript>: Outside.

02:40:09
<transcript>: Our exchange.

02:40:12
<transcript>: And let's see if this works.

02:40:12
<transcript>: console

02:40:16
<transcript>: Console Dot Log resources.

02:40:19
<transcript>: Such a research server.

02:40:28
<transcript>: We should see that list of file names if everything worked right.

02:40:34
<transcript>: And it may not have.

02:40:34
<transcript>: move a ref

02:40:36
<transcript>: Move a refresh the page.

02:40:42
<transcript>: Maybe if I click new game that's the first time it'll import that file I guess Yeah.

02:40:42
<transcript>: there it is

02:40:44
<transcript>: There it is. There. We got them.

02:40:44
<transcript>: we

02:40:46
<transcript>: We got them.

02:40:54
<transcript>: Okay. So there's all our file names. Now we can parse that to get the actual names of the services, right.

02:40:57
daeeyy: The Turkish barbers can sort that hair out for you.

02:40:58
<transcript>: So here.

02:40:59
uberrick: sell me on tmux a sec, is there a big learning curve or just more key bindings? :D

02:41:08
<transcript>: Okay. Do I want to do that here? I probably want to do that earlier in the servers lifetime. How can I do that? Like at the beginning.

02:41:09
andreull: is the stream available after u go offline?

02:41:09
<transcript>: Index. Maybe.

02:41:09
<transcript>: put here

02:41:11
<transcript>: Put here.

02:41:16
<transcript>: I want to do it like when the server starts up, but I don't have a custom servers. So.

02:41:23
<transcript>: I'm just reading some chat. Here.

02:41:23
<transcript>: the tur

02:41:26
<transcript>: The Turkish barbers can sort that hair out for you.

02:41:31
<transcript>: Push pan. Thank you for the follow push pan.

02:41:31
<transcript>: thank you so much

02:41:32
<transcript>: Thank you so much.

02:41:38
<transcript>: Sew me on tmux? Is there a big learning curve or just more key bindings.

02:41:38
<transcript>: one sec

02:41:44
<transcript>: One SEC. I'm gonna do that first. I want to answer Andre yes. The stream available is stream is available after I go offline.

02:41:49
<transcript>: I think they're for 14 days my VODs are available so you'll see my bottom, my page.

02:41:49
<transcript>: if maybe

02:41:55
catmodev: awesome setup

02:42:09
<transcript>: If maybe then you can watch it in a lower quality. Maybe the transcoding. Does it work for VODs? I guess. Maybe now. I don't know. I hope. I hope so. I feel bad for anybody today that couldn't sort of watch live because the 1080p is too much. I apologize. I thought it was always give you the option to walk in 720 or 480 or whatever. But I learned today you have to be a partner. So now I'm gonna.

02:42:09
<transcript>: really start pushing

02:42:18
<transcript>: Really start pushing to be a partner. I want to be a Twitch partner because I want you all to build a transcode in whatever quality you want. And I want to be able to stream in 1080p or maybe 4K. Who knows.

02:42:18
<transcript>: probably ten eight

02:42:20
<transcript>: Probably 1080p.

02:42:25
<transcript>: Thank you so much cat move for the awesome setup comment. Thank you.

02:42:25
<transcript>: i've spent

02:42:30
<transcript>: I've spent a lot of time on my setup, so it's nice to hear that you enjoy it.

02:42:30
<transcript>: okay

02:42:31
<transcript>: Okay. So Rick.

02:42:36
<transcript>: Timox.

02:42:40
<transcript>: It's pretty great. I mean, there's a lot.

02:42:42
<transcript>: For me.

02:42:42
<transcript>: to

02:42:44
<transcript>: To like conceptualize.

02:42:44
<transcript>: the idea of

02:42:57
<transcript>: The idea of sessions that have windows that have pains just feels like all these containers and feels very confusing. But the reason I got onto tmux, I guess is.

02:42:59
<transcript>: I was using alacrity.

02:43:03
<transcript>: And with Alacrity, there are no tabs.

02:43:14
<transcript>: And I feel like I've found that I was missing that being able to just not have to open a whole new whole new window. So teammux kind of gave me that within Alacrity. So I guess it's like.

02:43:14
<transcript>: a way to use

02:43:17
<transcript>: A way to use the simplest dumbest.

02:43:17
<transcript>: emulator

02:43:22
<transcript>: Emulator if you just want to use the builtin Charm terminal in your Mac or whatever.

02:43:22
<transcript>: but then have

02:43:29
<transcript>: But then have all the functionality that you always expect. You kind of configure Team X instead of the Emulator itself. That's my takeaway.

02:43:36
<transcript>: There's a lot of stuff like session persistence, and the way it brings up, it's so many fuzzy floating around in my office. Can you see these on camera.

02:43:46
<transcript>: Pollen in all these fuzzy so just flying around in my face. It's my lights probably make them many more visible. But anyway.

02:43:46
<transcript>: yeah

02:43:57
<transcript>: Yeah. Tmux I think it's worth it. There's like three things I had to learn about teamucks, and then I feel like I know enough about Team Ox to get some value out of it. It is a little weird now, like having.

02:43:57
<transcript>: key command

02:44:03
<transcript>: Key commands for Team X that I'm having to like, remember how to create a new Team X window.

02:44:10
<transcript>: And then versus navigating. So in Vim, for instance, you have vertical splits, and it.

02:44:10
<transcript>: feels weird

02:44:22
<transcript>: Feels weird to be able to do that or create a new pain in tmux and which do I want to do and why? And like I'm still not fully like there. I haven't gotten it all, but I feel like I know enough to get value out of it.

02:44:28
<transcript>: Alright. So is there a place.

02:44:28
<transcript>: we want to do the

02:44:30
<transcript>: We want to do the work.

02:44:30
<transcript>: that's better

02:44:34
<transcript>: That's better than just here in this particular router. I think so.

02:44:37
<transcript>: Think what I want to do is.

02:44:39
<transcript>: Yank.

02:44:39
<transcript>: these seven lines

02:44:41
<transcript>: These seven lines.

02:44:44
uberrick: Yeah makes sense! Will take a look at it

02:44:46
uberrick: Thnaks

02:44:48
<transcript>: Yank them and put them over here.

02:44:54
<transcript>: I don't know if this is actually better.

02:44:58
<transcript>: But that's what we're gonna do.

02:45:00
<transcript>: Well we're gonna do.

02:45:08
<transcript>: So here's our resources. We're going to build up a little.

02:45:11
<transcript>: More strongly Typed than just strings.

02:45:15
<transcript>: Export type.

02:45:17
<transcript>: Resource.

02:45:24
<transcript>: Should I just make this an interface? I'm always torn on the like.

02:45:35
<transcript>: Interface versus type. Like, everybody was like, Interfaces are better. You should use interfaces than you can. And then there's a bunch of backlash. Like, actually, there's a lot of nuance. And now I just don't know what to think.

02:45:45
<transcript>: Of the type.

02:45:54
<transcript>: There's a name.

02:45:56
<transcript>: Image.

02:46:01
<transcript>: What else.

02:46:02
thechosenone1080: allo

02:46:15
<transcript>: Oh, AWS, for Amazon.

02:46:17
<transcript>: Prebix.

02:46:17
<transcript>: is

02:46:21
<transcript>: Is AWS, or Amazon.

02:46:28
uberrick: haha I do types by default now but yeah there are some odd situations when interfaces are extended easier? I can't quite remember

02:46:30
<transcript>: So we're going to map.

02:46:30
<transcript>: this

02:46:32
<transcript>: This.

02:46:44
<transcript>: We're gonna map this.

02:46:46
<transcript>: To a.

02:46:50
<transcript>: One of these things. These resources. So now.

02:46:53
<transcript>: Is going to be.

02:46:56
<transcript>: Hang on.

02:47:00
<transcript>: We actually need to do like this.

02:47:07
<transcript>: Okay.

02:47:16
<transcript>: Bear with me. Here.

02:47:23
<transcript>: Resources. These are gonna be.

02:47:29
<transcript>: Right.

02:47:32
<transcript>: And what we're gonna do is let's see, part.

02:47:36
<transcript>: We'll do this prefix.

02:47:41
<transcript>: Name.

02:47:45
<transcript>: Equals.

02:47:49
<transcript>: Name split.

02:47:52
<transcript>: On Hyphens. Okay.

02:47:52
<transcript>: i can't

02:47:54
<transcript>: I can't call that name.

02:47:56
<transcript>: Prefix.

02:48:00
<transcript>: All name.

02:48:00
<transcript>: i guess

02:48:02
<transcript>: I guess.

02:48:06
<transcript>: So now we have the prefix and the full name.

02:48:10
<transcript>: Let's see we can come down here and say.

02:48:17
<transcript>: Full name now is going to be.

02:48:23
<transcript>: Let's see. I want to rename this actually.

02:48:26
<transcript>: We're gonna name that.

02:48:29
<transcript>: Name we're gonna call it.

02:48:38
<transcript>: I'll just still call it file name. And you could say, like, why not do all this in one map? That's probably better. That's a great question. I should probably do it in one map.

02:48:43
<transcript>: Name.

02:48:47
<transcript>: Equals path parse file name.

02:48:51
<transcript>: Okay. So now we have the name.

02:48:55
<transcript>: This Const name.

02:48:58
<transcript>: Got a little trippy there. What did I just do.

02:49:01
<transcript>: Fonts.

02:49:13
<transcript>: Formatted I don't know I don't love it we'll come back to it name.

02:49:20
<transcript>: We could just rename this, right.

02:49:22
<transcript>: So.

02:49:25
<transcript>: Iconated.

02:49:31
ryankhawkins: RAID

02:50:19
<transcript>: why pepper

02:50:24
bendmyers: @Fredkisss that's Ben Holmes

02:50:26
whitep4nth3r: oh hai

02:50:31
<transcript>: Why, Pepper? Thank you so much for the raid. There's some confetti. I'm really sorry to anybody that can't view my stream today because it's one thousand and eighty P. I don't have any transcoding. I apologize for that. I feel really bad about it. Actually.

02:50:31
<transcript>: thought about closing

02:50:33
<transcript>: Thought about closing down the stream early just because.

02:50:33
<transcript>: feel bad

02:50:33
bendmyers: @bholmesdev, haha

02:50:37
<transcript>: Feel bad? I don't know. Like there's people who can't watch.

02:50:37
<transcript>: but

02:50:38
<transcript>: But.

02:50:38
<transcript>: oh that's

02:50:40
<transcript>: Oh, that's been homes.

02:50:43
<transcript>: Well, we love YouTube indie Myers.

<transcript>: You're not. You're not that guy, but you're. You're awesome. White Panther sinking. You so much for the rage. I appreciate it a lot.

02:50:52
andreull: for me it's not the 1080p, I joined late I guess

02:50:55
<transcript>: We're working on AW, guess.

02:50:55
<transcript>: and aw

02:50:59
dr_dinomight: Not a real DR, more like an imposter but I also love the term Disaster Recovery  I might "steal" that :P

02:51:02
<transcript>: And AW, guess is, how would we describe this? It's a game where you're gonna get an AWS logo.

02:51:02
<transcript>: and you have

02:51:10
<transcript>: And you have to guess. You have four choices. You have to guess which one is the right service name. You know, AWS has like 300 plus services.

02:51:12
fredkisss: @BenDMyers Sorry Ben the creator of the show SomeanticsDev

02:51:16
whitep4nth3r: oooh this sounds like my kind of app

02:51:21
<transcript>: That's the idea. Really. We're using it as an excuse to learn the P three stack. I've just never played with TRPC, and this is a way to do that. So that's what we're working on.

02:51:23
whitep4nth3r: very much my style

02:51:27
bendmyers: @Fredkisss yep that one, haha

02:51:31
<transcript>: Not a real doctor, more like an impostor, but I also love the term disaster recovery. My steal. That all right, disaster recover. Dynomite.

02:51:37
<transcript>: So me antics Div.

02:51:47
bendmyers: Some Antics

02:51:48
<transcript>: Wait. Ben Meyers. Do I know you? Ben? Oh, some antics. I sorry. I read. That totally wrong. Semantics. That's who Ben Meyers is. I.

02:51:48
<transcript>: yes

02:51:55
bendmyers: I do accessibility thingies

02:51:58
bendmyers: Ahhh, okay!

02:52:00
<transcript>: Yes, I know who you are, Ben. I knew your name was familiar. I saw the name Ben Meyers. And I said, I know Ben Meyers. It wasn't Been Holmes. That's a different guy. But I do know Ben Meyers. I actually have known have been Myers.

02:52:00
<transcript>: long before i

02:52:05
<transcript>: Long before I knew who been Holmes was. So there you go, Ben.

02:52:06
thechosenone1080: and im the chosen one

02:52:12
<transcript>: You're the Bin. I actually knew? Yeah? Accessibility things I knew who you are? Some antics? Yep, Yep, Yep? I'm I'm on the same page.

02:52:22
<transcript>: This is your kind of style. You're kind of app White Panther. That's good to hear. Then your viewers should be right at home. We're building things just like White Panther.

02:52:23
viasanctus: not to confuse with ben laden

02:52:25
<transcript>: Okay.

02:52:32
<transcript>: So formatted. Let's get back to it here. We're taking the full name.

02:52:32
<transcript>: and

02:52:38
<transcript>: And we're going to capitalize. I want to capitalize all the first letters, right.

02:52:46
whitep4nth3r: gotta go but have a good one! See you soon!

02:52:48
<transcript>: We want to turn these into actual names. So I think we just need to, like.

02:52:48
<transcript>: capital

02:52:50
<transcript>: Capitalize each letter.

02:52:52
<transcript>: What's that called.

02:52:59
<transcript>: Set casing call thank you for the follows in Huggins and Dowdy and Ninosauri or.

02:53:01
whitep4nth3r: PascalCase

02:53:03
<transcript>: Not to confuse with Bin Laden. Yes. We don't want to confuse there.

02:53:03
<transcript>: welcome to chat

02:53:05
bendmyers: @whitep4nth3r ^^

02:53:10
thechosenone1080: @viaSanctus oh the 0.81818181818 guy

02:53:11
viasanctus: thank you

02:53:14
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat via Sanctus. Gotta go see a White Panther. Thanks again, Pascal Case. Thank you. I didn't know if it was different when I had a space bill between the words, if it was still Pascal Case, or if that.

02:53:17
<transcript>: Thank you again, White Panther. We'll see you later.

02:53:26
<transcript>: What was I doing? Oh, yeah. So Pascow case. So we want to do Pascal case.

02:53:26
<transcript>: each

02:53:30
<transcript>: Each word. So let's just do this.

02:53:33
<transcript>: Two Pascal case.

02:53:33
<transcript>: we'll pass in

02:53:36
<transcript>: We'll pass in the full name.

02:53:36
<transcript>: the full name

02:53:39
<transcript>: The full name would be everything but the prefix.

02:53:39
<transcript>: the prefix is like

02:53:43
<transcript>: The prefix is like AWS or Amazon, right.

02:53:43
<transcript>: right

02:53:45
<transcript>: Right. Yeah.

02:53:45
<transcript>: and

02:53:48
<transcript>: And if we want to.

02:53:48
<transcript>: pascal

02:53:51
<transcript>: Pascal case. Let's make that up here.

02:53:55
<transcript>: Two passcow case we're gonna take in a string.

02:53:58
<transcript>: And return a strings.

02:54:04
<transcript>: Right. We're gonna figure that out in a second.

02:54:04
<transcript>: full

02:54:05
<transcript>: Full name.

02:54:05
<transcript>: tropical name

02:54:07
<transcript>: Tropical name.

02:54:09
<transcript>: What's wrongful name.

02:54:09
<transcript>: type

02:54:11
<transcript>: Type.

02:54:11
<transcript>: not aside

02:54:13
<transcript>: Not asideable as have resource.

02:54:21
<transcript>: Coming in type name image prefix.

02:54:21
<transcript>: oh

02:54:25
<transcript>: Oh, I see. Prefix could be undefined here. Is that what we're saying.

02:54:25
<transcript>: we're defined

02:54:30
<transcript>: We're defined. Okay, so that's not good prefix has to be defined.

02:54:32
<transcript>: We could just.

02:54:36
<transcript>: Hyphenated name is String, but there's.

02:54:44
<transcript>: The first item in that array is definitely going to at least be hyphenated name right.

02:54:50
<transcript>: So why would they why would prefix be string around defined here? Doesn't really make sense to me.

02:54:55
<transcript>: Doesn't make sense to me.

02:55:04
<transcript>: Well.

02:55:04
<transcript>: well

02:55:07
<transcript>: Well, well and what are they saying about full name here.

02:55:07
<transcript>: full name

02:55:11
<transcript>: Full name is the string Rate. Oh, I gotta join those right.

02:55:11
<transcript>: i gotta do

02:55:13
<transcript>: I gotta do like that join.

02:55:15
<transcript>: Spaces.

02:55:17
<transcript>: Okay.

02:55:17
<transcript>: oh

02:55:20
<transcript>: Oh, that fixed some things. Maybe.

02:55:25
<transcript>: Formatted thank you for the follow via Sync this.

02:55:25
<transcript>: appreciate it

02:55:26
<transcript>: Appreciate it.

02:55:31
<transcript>: Yeah. Been Ben Meyers. I.

02:55:32
viasanctus: thank you for the stream

02:55:32
<transcript>: 've.

02:55:32
<transcript>: seen you on

02:55:41
<transcript>: Seen you on Twitter. I've seen you on Twitch. Did you do on Learning with Jason or did you have Jason on I know. I've been aware of you for months.

02:55:41
<transcript>: and

02:55:47
<transcript>: And I only recently learned to been homes, like in the last couple weeks, I saw one of his whiteboard things.

02:55:49
bendmyers: I've done two LWJs, yep!

02:55:51
<transcript>: You're welcome for the stream.

02:55:51
<transcript>: you're so very welcome

02:55:53
<transcript>: You're so very welcome. I wish you.

02:55:53
<transcript>: were

02:56:00
<transcript>: Were I wish it were able to be viewed in 720p or four ADP or whatever bandwidth.

02:56:00
<transcript>: constraints you

02:56:03
<transcript>: Constraints you might have. I apologize.

02:56:03
<transcript>: i learned

02:56:06
<transcript>: I learned today the only Twitch partners.

02:56:06
<transcript>: the twitch

02:56:17
<transcript>: The Twitch partners get transcoding. So now I want to be a Twitch partner. So if you guys just want to stick around and keep following and watching all my streams and tell them the Twitch partner, that'd be great. I'd appreciate it.

02:56:17
<transcript>: i also get

02:56:21
<transcript>: I also get to get a custom prefix that sounds fun. Email prefix.

02:56:25
<transcript>: Okay two passcode case.

02:56:25
<transcript>: thank you

02:56:27
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow.

02:56:27
<transcript>: that sick

02:56:28
<transcript>: That sicko.

02:56:30
viasanctus: with these viewcounts you should be fine

02:56:34
thechosenone1080: you will get it tomorrow

02:56:34
<transcript>: So how do we want to do Pascal case? So if we have a bunch of words.

02:56:34
<transcript>: we're just going

02:56:35
viasanctus: matter of time

02:56:39
<transcript>: We're just going to assume this value is a it's already.

02:56:41
<transcript>: Pretty.

02:56:48
<transcript>: Pascal case. Just like any given string. We're past twelve with very known constraints.

02:56:48
<transcript>: it's

02:56:52
<transcript>: It's a set of words separated by spaces.

02:56:55
<transcript>: So what so I can do.

02:57:02
<transcript>: We can say.

02:57:02
<transcript>: part

02:57:04
<transcript>: Part.

02:57:04
<transcript>: words

02:57:06
<transcript>: Words equals value split.

02:57:07
bowdy: did you always use vim?

02:57:10
<transcript>: Space. So we're splitting on space.

02:57:14
<transcript>: It was kind of weird to do after I just joined it.

02:57:20
<transcript>: Well, do I even need to have? Yeah, yeah, let's just do this. Let's.

02:57:20
<transcript>: do

02:57:21
<transcript>: Do.

02:57:22
mhuggins7278: I really like the color contrast on that theme..what one are you using..I'll feel silly if it's the default :-)

02:57:25
<transcript>: Let's do this.

02:57:25
<transcript>: let's say

02:57:28
<transcript>: Let's say strings, array.

02:57:28
<transcript>: let's just make

02:57:31
<transcript>: Let's just make these words.

02:57:35
<transcript>: So if we want to.

02:57:35
<transcript>: make this

02:57:39
<transcript>: Make this Pascal case. It's just words, map.

02:57:42
<transcript>: And then.

02:57:42
<transcript>: we're so

02:57:45
<transcript>: We're so each word needs to have.

02:57:49
<transcript>: The first letter capitalized. Right.

02:57:58
<transcript>: And our words are strings in JavaScript, just an array of characters. Can I do this? Can I say not that word.

02:58:00
<transcript>: I spread it.

02:58:00
<transcript>: no

02:58:01
<transcript>: No.

02:58:04
<transcript>: Or can I.

02:58:04
<transcript>: can

02:58:06
<transcript>: Can I.

02:58:11
0xvivek: Is that 200$ monospace font ?

02:58:13
thechosenone1080: but what is a string in javascript

02:58:14
<transcript>: Give up.

02:58:16
<transcript>: Javascript.

02:58:16
<transcript>: capital

02:58:16
fredkisss: split then spread

02:58:20
<transcript>: Capitalize First Letter. There you go.

02:58:27
<transcript>: To upgrades. Oh, just slice it. Of course.

02:58:27
<transcript>: i got all fan

02:58:30
<transcript>: I got all fancy with my spread operators.

02:58:30
<transcript>: all i need to do

02:58:32
<transcript>: All I need to do is.

02:58:33
<transcript>: So we're.

02:58:33
thechosenone1080: @Fredkisss sir this is a christian stream

02:58:41
<transcript>: Care at zero.

02:58:42
<transcript>: Two uppercase.

02:58:44
<transcript>: Right.

02:58:44
<transcript>: this makes sense

02:58:47
<transcript>: This makes sense plus.

02:58:49
uberrick: sometimes it is easier to capitalize using Tailwind :D

02:58:49
<transcript>: Word, dot, slice, one.

02:58:49
<transcript>: so just take

02:58:53
<transcript>: So just take everything with the first character, right? Yeah.

02:58:56
<transcript>: That sounds good.

02:59:01
uberrick: well CSS even

02:59:05
<transcript>: Chosen one, split and spread whatever we at. I really like the color contrast on that scene. This is Dracula.

02:59:05
<transcript>: welcome

02:59:18
fredkisss: @Fredkisss LUL LUL LUL

02:59:25
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat in Hughens. I appreciate you joining us in chat. Did I always use them? No. I am about three weeks into my vim journey. I've used them throughout my career. Like, for, like, SSHing into stuff. And like, when I was on remote servers, I used them a lot to edit text, so I knew how to, like, get out of them. But that was basically it. I didn't really.

02:59:25
<transcript>: know how to use

02:59:32
<transcript>: Know how to use them and I guess in the last few weeks I became a convert. I use vs. Code for like last five years.

02:59:40
<transcript>: And switched over to me. Neovem. Ever since I started streaming, I guess I got interested in it just because everybody on Twitch seems to use it.

02:59:43
datsycko: do you have your vim config files anywhere?

02:59:46
<transcript>: You've done two learning with Jason. So that's what it was been. I've seen you on Learning with Jason. That's how I learned a view.

02:59:54
<transcript>: With these you counts. You'll get it tomorrow. Tomorrow. I don't know about that. I don't think I'll be a partner tomorrow.

02:59:56
<transcript>: That'd be cool.

02:59:56
<transcript>: that

02:59:58
<transcript>: That 200.

02:59:58
<transcript>: yeah

03:00:04
<transcript>: Yeah, it's operating mono. I did spend money on a font. That is the thing that I did.

03:00:06
daglee: I have used vim for 8 years because I don't know how to quit

03:00:06
uberrick: @datSycko Yes, it's https://github.com/adamelmore/dotfiles

03:00:15
datsycko: @datSycko thank you!

03:00:22
<transcript>: Do I regret it? No. I actually love this font. It's grown on me quite a lot. I'm gonna come over here and read chat. I haven't really greeted any of you. You all join me after White Panther Ratted. And I haven't really taken the time to say Hello and show you this view. This is my office. This is where I work.

03:00:26
bowdy: your vim setup looks so nice!

03:00:27
<transcript>: I feel like I'm just flexing right now because I love my office and like, look at it. It's pretty great.

03:00:27
<transcript>: i

03:00:28
andreull: rjch people font

03:00:30
<transcript>: I'm not trying to I just kind of I ended up here.

03:00:34
andreull: rich*

03:00:34
<transcript>: Let's see. Sometimes it's easier to capitalize using tailwind.

03:00:34
bowdy: what is that behind you?

03:00:39
<transcript>: Css Even Fred kiss.

03:00:47
<transcript>: Do you? Do you have your Vim Config files? Anywhere I do on my dot files. Sico. Welcome to Chat as well.

03:00:47
<transcript>: it

03:00:53
graftark: looks like a lego town with lights.

03:00:54
<transcript>: It looks like some. I already linked. Thank you, Rick. There's my dot files. Use them for eight years because I don't know how to quit.

03:00:54
<transcript>: the

03:00:57
<transcript>: The vim quit jokes. They never get old to me.

03:01:04
<transcript>: Rich people fought. I mean it did cost like $200. So I guess.

03:01:04
<transcript>: in that sense

03:01:04
yeltrah_: @Graftark It is

03:01:06
<transcript>: In that sense.

03:01:06
<transcript>: it's not

03:01:07
<transcript>: It's not just for everybody.

03:01:07
<transcript>: i was sold

03:01:13
<transcript>: I was sold by Learn with Jason actually Jason Langstorf uses operated mono that sold me.

03:01:13
<transcript>: thank you

03:01:16
<transcript>: Thank you so much, Macket. Macatu Key for the follow.

03:01:26
<transcript>: What is it behind me? It's. So I've got some Lego buildings. That's what these are. I don't know if my fingers in the right spot. I can't really tell, like a weather man.

03:01:26
<transcript>: these are

03:01:29
<transcript>: These are Lego Buildings for Modular buildings.

03:01:29
<transcript>: yeah

03:01:33
<transcript>: Yeah. Lego Town with Light. That's right. It is.

03:01:41
<transcript>: Okay. So if you're new to this channel, I did just get off vacation. So I came back today after taking, like, five days off.

03:01:41
<transcript>: and

03:01:46
<transcript>: And I'm a little sluggish still getting up to speed.

03:01:49
<transcript>: Not like I didn't. I'm not trying to like.

03:01:49
<transcript>: gloss over

03:01:55
<transcript>: Gloss over my vim usage. I'm just slow at them. That's just how I always am, but more like.

03:01:55
<transcript>: i'm

03:02:00
<transcript>: I'm cognitively not there yet. I'm still kind of on vacation. Still waking up if you will.

03:02:06
<transcript>: Yeah. What do we do on this stream? I feel like I should do, like, a little, like, tell you all what we do.

03:02:06
<transcript>: we mostly do

03:02:21
<transcript>: We mostly do Web stuff. I did spend, like a month building my Twitch overlays on Stream. So all the stuff you'll see on this stream, the overlay stuff, the notifications and all that we built all that on stream. That wasn't really web. I guess it kind of is it's a web project. It just runs locally.

03:02:27
<transcript>: I build public Dev which is like a it's.

03:02:27
<transcript>: a

03:02:28
<transcript>: A.

03:02:28
<transcript>: personal site

03:02:33
<transcript>: Personal site builder for Devs. So I've been working on that on Stream, some.

03:02:39
<transcript>: What else? What else do we do around here? Folks? People who are regulars.

03:02:48
<transcript>: I guess it's a coworking stream. I stream four days a week. I'm gonna probably cut that to three days a week so I can start some YouTube stuff.

03:02:51
<transcript>: Yeah, I'll try to keep my schedule up to date.

03:02:51
<transcript>: it's nice to have you here

03:02:55
<transcript>: It's nice to have you here. Nice to have you all. I appreciate you.

03:02:55
<transcript>: okay

03:02:58
thechosenone1080: we are aesthetic

03:02:58
<transcript>: Okay. We'll go back to it. We listen to music.

03:02:58
<transcript>: if you have some requests

03:03:00
<transcript>: If you have some requests.

03:03:04
schrew: listen to alt-j, try a new productivity "app" all the time

03:03:09
<transcript>: I'm trying to control we're aesthetic. That is true. I'm really into aesthetics, except for my own personal appearance. Apparently, we listen to a lot of all J.

03:03:09
<transcript>: we do

03:03:12
<transcript>: We do try a lot of new productivity apps is true.

03:03:20
bendmyers: Yessssss, alt-J

03:03:21
<transcript>: We got into Timux, and then just in the last couple weeks. So I'm taking in a lot.

03:03:21
<transcript>: i'm not

03:03:30
<transcript>: I'm not absorbing it all, but I'm taking it a lot. Let's listen to some all. J. I'm missing it. Rufus has been good. He's been good to us, but it's time for some all day.

03:03:38
mhuggins7278: since you were on vacation I'll mention it here ThePrimeagean just released a new video on vim horizontal motions. I think he said it's the first in a new series on movements

03:03:44
<transcript>: And then let's get actually something working on a to be guess I feel like it's been a few streams now and we're so kind of in the no Man's land.

03:03:54
thechosenone1080: yeah and its very good

03:03:55
<transcript>: All right.

03:04:01
<transcript>: Resources. So it doesn't like the prefix.

03:04:06
<transcript>: Could be null. I don't like that. It thinks prefix could be null.

03:04:10
<transcript>: It's not. No. I promise.

03:04:12
thechosenone1080: di) ci) is soo useful

03:04:13
<transcript>: Oh, that didn't actually fix it. Some. Maybe that wasn't the issue.

03:04:27
mhuggins7278: I've also recently come back to vim/nvim after a couple of years in vscode

03:04:29
<transcript>: String is not a sandwich. Oh, oh, it's got the Idioms or Amazon. Yeah.

03:04:42
<transcript>: How about this? Oh, no, no.

03:04:47
<transcript>: It is.

03:04:50
<transcript>: For Amazon.

03:04:52
uberrick: heading off, hope you have a good rest of your stream and day

03:04:58
<transcript>: Delete to the end of the line yeah, Yeah.

03:05:01
<transcript>: This is a prefix.

03:05:04
<transcript>: Right. Okay.

03:05:04
<transcript>: so then

03:05:06
<transcript>: So then down here we can say.

03:05:08
uberrick: Cya folks

03:05:15
<transcript>: Okay, formatted. That's going to be our name.

03:05:27
<transcript>: Formatted, and then image. Okay. So image is actually interesting. We're gonna hash the name.

03:05:35
<transcript>: But what are we? Hashing? Anyone? Remember? I wrote this script.

03:05:45
<transcript>: Where did I write that script? Rename images. So this is where we hashed all the file names so that you can just look at the file name to see what the service is.

03:05:49
<transcript>: New paths so hash is the name.

03:05:49
<transcript>: so

03:05:50
<transcript>: So without.

03:05:53
<transcript>: The SVG.

03:06:01
<transcript>: So it's the name, the Raw name. It'd be this one iconated name. That's it. We need hash. Hyphenated name.

03:06:07
<transcript>: So here I'm going to copy some code, right. I want to do this.

03:06:07
thechosenone1080: bye

03:06:10
<transcript>: I want to yank that.

03:06:10
<transcript>: and

03:06:13
<transcript>: And our hash looks like.

03:06:13
<transcript>: this

03:06:14
<transcript>: This.

03:06:18
<transcript>: Now we got to import crypto.

03:06:27
<transcript>: From Crypto. Okay.

03:06:27
<transcript>: so

03:06:32
<transcript>: So crypto create hash update and then this is going to be hyphenated name.

03:06:32
<transcript>: okay

03:06:34
<transcript>: Okay.

03:06:34
<transcript>: that's our hash

03:06:35
<transcript>: That's our hash.

03:06:35
<transcript>: is also

03:06:38
<transcript>: Is also to start image URL right.

03:06:38
<transcript>: no i guess

03:06:42
<transcript>: No, I guess not quite. We want to do it like this. Oh.

03:06:45
<transcript>: I don't like that.

03:06:45
<transcript>: i don't like which

03:06:47
<transcript>: I don't like which key. Get out of here.

03:06:47
<transcript>: get out of here

03:06:52
<transcript>: Get out of here. Whiskey. I just want to type in a literal that character.

03:06:52
<transcript>: on that

03:06:55
<transcript>: On that in insert mode.

03:06:55
<transcript>: oh no

03:06:57
<transcript>: Oh, no, it still doesn't matter.

03:06:58
thechosenone1080: you should jump more

03:06:59
<transcript>: Oh no.

03:07:05
<transcript>: Them crisis. Sometimes I just panic. I just start typing stuff. There we go.

03:07:07
<transcript>: Hash.

03:07:07
<transcript>: and then

03:07:08
<transcript>: And then.

03:07:08
<transcript>: dot

03:07:08
thechosenone1080: instead of jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj

03:07:11
<transcript>: Dot SVD, right.

03:07:16
<transcript>: I guess we could do the full path to make it even easier. So public.

03:07:19
<transcript>: Public images.

03:07:19
<transcript>: hash

03:07:22
<transcript>: Hashed. I think.

03:07:24
thechosenone1080: or bracket hop

03:07:29
0xvivek: I use `f`

03:07:30
<transcript>: Hashed to have original in hashed.

03:07:36
0xvivek: to jump to next matched char

03:07:39
<transcript>: Okay, public Images hashed. And then the hash. Svg. Okay, this looks like I think this will work. These are our resources.

03:07:39
<transcript>: still

03:07:42
<transcript>: Still doesn't like something? What doesn't it like.

03:07:46
<transcript>: Not a sail type resource.

03:07:46
<transcript>: so name

03:07:49
<transcript>: So name, image and prefix.

03:07:50
thechosenone1080: yeah but im talking about going 40 lines down

03:07:51
daglee: ctrl-o to jump back if you make a larger jump :)

03:07:56
<transcript>: Name is a string array. That's the problem formatted Where's formatted at.

03:07:58
<transcript>: Pascow case.

03:08:01
<transcript>: Let's just string. Join this. We say.

03:08:03
0xvivek: ohh you mean 40j ?

03:08:05
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:08:05
<transcript>: well that returns

03:08:08
thechosenone1080: yeah

03:08:11
<transcript>: Well, that returns a string. Okay, cool. Did I really have to do this as prefix.

03:08:12
<transcript>: I really.

03:08:16
<transcript>: Have to do that. That didn't work.

03:08:22
<transcript>: Oh, that's gonna be so cool, too. I thought I was thought I was doing a thing. Nope.

03:08:31
0xvivek: I also like `}`

03:08:33
<transcript>: No. Okay. We had to do the ad as the casting.

03:08:36
<transcript>: Okay.

03:08:36
<transcript>: so

03:08:38
0xvivek: to move horizontally

03:08:42
<transcript>: So now we've got this resources. Let's let's actually just make sure this looks good.

03:08:43
0xvivek: srry vertically

03:08:48
<transcript>: I'm logging it.

03:08:55
<transcript>: So it's still not gonna do it until I click new game. Okay, so there we had some recognition.

03:08:55
<transcript>: hash there's

03:08:55
thechosenone1080: isnt it just ]

03:09:04
<transcript>: Hash. There's the image. There's a prefix. Amazon Recognition. Okay, that'll feels good. S Three on Outposts. Everything look good. Sage Maker. Crown Truth. Yeah.

03:09:04
<transcript>: i do wish

03:09:08
<transcript>: I do wish I could do that when the server boots up and not.

03:09:10
<transcript>: Wait until the first request.

03:09:10
<transcript>: bought initial

03:09:13
<transcript>: Bought initialization, you know.

03:09:30
<transcript>: I'll see you, Rick. I missed it. See you, Rick. I always miss those things.

03:09:40
<transcript>: Since you're on vacation, I'll mention it. Here. The private industry release new video on Vim her horizontal motions. I think he says first, in a new series of movements. Yes.

03:09:40
<transcript>: it's definitely

03:09:43
<transcript>: It's definitely in my list of things I'm going to watch soon.

03:09:43
<transcript>: it's

03:09:45
<transcript>: It's very good.

03:09:45
<transcript>: di

03:09:57
<transcript>: Di and CI is so useful. So delete insight. Yeah, those are very useful recently. Came back to nvim after a couple years in vs code. Hey, so we're.

03:09:57
<transcript>: we're

03:10:02
<transcript>: We're learning together. Well, if you've already done it before, you're learning less than me.

03:10:11
<transcript>: Yeah, I should jump more. I don't page up and date page down enough. I just J a lot and I also care a lot.

03:10:17
<transcript>: I'm trying to get better at the horizontal motion thing. Like the F and T's.

03:10:20
<transcript>: And.

03:10:22
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:10:22
<transcript>: so sometimes

03:10:27
<transcript>: So sometimes I do remember to page up and page down most times I don't.

03:10:32
<transcript>: So now we have this resources. Let's do export console.

03:10:32
<transcript>: okay

03:10:33
<transcript>: Okay.

03:10:33
<transcript>: and now

03:10:34
beardage: having page up and page down on my thumb cluster made me use it a lot more

03:10:35
<transcript>: And now we can import this thing.

03:10:45
<transcript>: I really wished there was a place to do this on server start. I guess with a custom server there is, but I don't want that right.

03:10:49
<transcript>: It's okay. It's fine.

03:10:49
thechosenone1080: thumb cluster

03:10:55
<transcript>: Well, no. Is it fine, though. We're gonna do this every single API request, right? Because there's no running server.

03:11:04
<transcript>: So is that code fast enough to do on every single request? I don't know. I don't think so.

03:11:05
<transcript>: I don't know.

03:11:07
mhuggins7278: ctrl-d, ctrl-u  for vertical movement. Then add Primes key mapping that adds zz to center after jumping

03:11:11
<transcript>: What if we wrote it to a file? What if it just went ahead and wrote it to a file? And then I just used the file.

03:11:11
<transcript>: now

03:11:13
<transcript>: Now.

03:11:13
<transcript>: better yet

03:11:15
<transcript>: Better yet, let's write it.

03:11:15
<transcript>: into

03:11:19
<transcript>: Into some code that I can just drop into the thing.

03:11:19
<transcript>: yeah

03:11:21
<transcript>: Yeah. That's what I want to do.

03:11:23
<transcript>: That's what I want to do.

03:11:28
<transcript>: So let's do this. Let's do FS, write.

03:11:28
<transcript>: fil

03:11:30
<transcript>: File.

03:11:32
<transcript>: Sync.

03:11:35
<transcript>: We're gonna write it to.

03:11:41
<transcript>: Resources JSON.

03:11:41
<transcript>: and we

03:11:44
<transcript>: And we're gonna write JSON.

03:11:47
<transcript>: We're gonna write.

03:11:47
<transcript>: json

03:11:50
<transcript>: Json stringify.

03:11:51
0xvivek: I use cf<char> to change upto the matched char but it only works for single line is there a way to do the same fo rmultiple line

03:11:53
<transcript>: Resources.

03:11:55
0xvivek: s

03:11:57
<transcript>: Right.

03:12:02
<transcript>: I look good.

03:12:02
<transcript>: just want to

03:12:06
<transcript>: Just want to write it to there so that I can I can bring over into code.

03:12:06
<transcript>: i guess i could write

03:12:09
<transcript>: I guess I could write it. No, that should work.

03:12:11
<transcript>: That should work.

03:12:14
<transcript>: Three start.

03:12:16
<transcript>: Refresh the page.

03:12:21
<transcript>: Okay should write it now to the file.

03:12:27
<transcript>: So do we have resources. Now.

03:12:34
<transcript>: It is cool. Okay. Api. Get this is exactly what I want. So.

03:12:39
<transcript>: Some of the casing might be wrong like that should be API gateway. Right.

03:12:39
<transcript>: like

03:12:41
<transcript>: Like API. Gateway.

03:12:44
<transcript>: Some of these might not be right.

03:12:47
<transcript>: Guess I'll just fix this.

03:12:47
<transcript>: case by case

03:12:49
<transcript>: Case by case.

03:12:51
<transcript>: Augmented AI.

03:12:53
<transcript>: A two, I.

03:12:57
<transcript>: Don't know what that is. Hello.

03:12:57
0xvivek: How to save eyes for long coding sessions ?

03:13:04
<transcript>: Sdk should SDK I'll be capitalized. These are the kind of things. Maybe I could do them in code, but.

03:13:05
0xvivek: from*

03:13:11
<transcript>: Cloud front. Like how this is bad. Yeah, this is bad. A lot of these are gonna be wrong.

03:13:16
<transcript>: Need to get the casing right.

03:13:16
<transcript>: how do i get

03:13:19
<transcript>: How do I get the casing on these? Right.

03:13:23
beardage: sounds silly but look out a window every 20-30 minutes

03:13:26
<transcript>: Like this.

03:13:34
glycincheck: What prisma db type do you use and where do your host your db?

03:13:37
<transcript>: Well.

03:13:39
<transcript>: That's unfortunate.

03:13:51
<transcript>: Like even that easy to I could go through and like replace every instance of these things. But.

03:13:57
<transcript>: You see two.

03:14:15
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah. Let's just do replacements. So, like, anywhere we see EKS. I want to replace it. So I'm gonna do.

03:14:15
<transcript>: percent

03:14:16
mhuggins7278: vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n","<C-d>", "<C-d>zz", {silent = true})

03:14:17
<transcript>: Percent? S.

03:14:17
<transcript>: my right

03:14:18
<transcript>: My right.

03:14:20
<transcript>: Eks.

03:14:20
<transcript>: gonna replace

03:14:23
<transcript>: Gonna replace with EKS.

03:14:23
<transcript>: mobile

03:14:24
<transcript>: Mobile.

03:14:28
<transcript>: We took care EKS.

03:14:33
<transcript>: Emr.

03:14:33
<transcript>: same

03:14:35
<transcript>: Same thing.

03:14:46
<transcript>: Bridge.

03:14:52
<transcript>: And do this for every file or for every service is gonna take forever.

03:14:52
<transcript>: okay let's

03:14:54
<transcript>: Okay. Let's just. We'll deal with it for now.

03:14:57
<transcript>: Let's copy this whole thing.

03:14:57
<transcript>: so i'm gonna

03:14:59
<transcript>: So I'm gonna do, like.

03:14:59
<transcript>: what

03:15:02
<transcript>: What? Yank? No. V.

03:15:05
<transcript>: vg

03:15:06
<transcript>: Vg.

03:15:09
<transcript>: Then yank it.

03:15:09
<transcript>: and then we're gonna

03:15:13
<transcript>: And then we're gonna go back to our game router.

03:15:20
<transcript>: Let's just put this in a big object up here. So comps resources.

03:15:23
<transcript>: Well, this thing.

03:15:23
<transcript>: giant

03:15:26
<transcript>: Giant giant thing.

03:15:33
<transcript>: I should probably move this to the bottom right.

03:15:35
<transcript>: Lab. Set, no fold.

03:15:39
<transcript>: So.

03:15:48
<transcript>: Okay.

03:15:59
<transcript>: Here we go. So resources is this even a valid JSON object.

03:16:01
beardage: ts won't get angry for using something before it's defined

03:16:02
<transcript>: Name.

03:16:07
<transcript>: There we go. Name, image prefix. Okay. So these are all resources.

03:16:13
beardage: ?

03:16:15
<transcript>: One of my missing here in chat.

03:16:24
<transcript>: Welcome to Chat. Glisten. Glycen. Check what Prisma DB type do you use and where do you host your DB? We're doing this one on the Planet scale.

03:16:24
<transcript>: because i

03:16:27
<transcript>: Because I want to play with planet scale as well.

03:16:38
<transcript>: Cf character to change up to the match character but only works for single lines or a way to do the same for multiple line.

03:16:46
<transcript>: Yeah.

03:16:46
<transcript>: some cluster

03:16:47
<transcript>: Some cluster.

03:16:50
<transcript>: I don't have a thumb cluster.

03:16:50
<transcript>: i did order in

03:16:51
glycincheck: Ah cool, me too

03:16:58
neochromer: oh man

03:17:01
neochromer: turning into prime I see :D

03:17:03
<transcript>: I did order in Advantage 360. I don't know when it'll be here, but I ordered one, so maybe then I'll use a thumb cluster. I just. I don't know if I can get on board with the split keyboard thing. We'll see if I can handle the aesthetics.

03:17:07
0xvivek: planetscale is popular after theo got sponsership from them

03:17:08
neochromer: i use a moonlander for a few yeras now

03:17:13
<transcript>: Turning into prime. Yeah, no, seriously. I mean, I wouldn't have started using Neovam. If not for prime. He's just.

03:17:13
<transcript>: he's an inspiration

03:17:15
<transcript>: He's an inspiration, you know.

03:17:16
beardage: I'm getting a 360 once they let you choose the switches too

03:17:17
<transcript>: Really is something.

03:17:17
neochromer: and I can't go back to the normal ones

03:17:19
<transcript>: An important okay.

03:17:19
<transcript>: in

03:17:22
neochromer: thumb clusters are a godsent

03:17:23
<transcript>: In Phoenix, influences.

03:17:24
beardage: I'm on an ergodox now

03:17:26
<transcript>: Okay.

03:17:32
<transcript>: Resources. So now here we can just choose resources randomly.

03:17:33
neochromer: the old ergodox/

03:17:35
0xvivek: In my defence George Hotz uses vscode to read code

03:17:35
<transcript>: We take the.

03:17:35
<transcript>: name

03:17:35
neochromer: ?

03:17:36
<transcript>: Name.

03:17:36
<transcript>: of

03:17:41
0xvivek: so it's ok to use vscode

03:17:46
<transcript>: Of one? And that'll be the answer. We pass all of them. Oh, we need to pass the images. So here's what we're gonna do. You create a new game.

03:17:46
beardage: the ergodox ez w/ the underglow

03:17:48
<transcript>: Here when you hit the new game button.

03:17:48
<transcript>: we create

03:17:50
<transcript>: We create a round.

03:17:50
<transcript>: it has an answer

03:17:55
<transcript>: It has an answer. We need to get the answer.

03:17:57
xxsallythegoosexx: @0xvivek no he doesn't, he writes in it

03:17:59
<transcript>: So let's do this. I need to.

03:17:59
<transcript>: that's just

03:18:01
<transcript>: That's just an array. Right down here.

03:18:01
<transcript>: yeah

03:18:06
<transcript>: Yeah, these are array of resources. We need to get a random from that array.

03:18:09
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:18:11
<transcript>: Javascript.

03:18:11
<transcript>: get

03:18:13
xxsallythegoosexx: and who cares if someone uses vscode. that doesn't define your abilities as a dev

03:18:16
<transcript>: Get random item from array. I've done this so many times.

03:18:16
<transcript>: there you go

03:18:17
0xvivek: now he started doing it

03:18:17
<transcript>: There you go.

03:18:22
<transcript>: There you go, right there, right.

03:18:22
<transcript>: our item

03:18:24
<transcript>: Our item.

03:18:33
<transcript>: Let's just paste it here.

03:18:40
<transcript>: Var item equals items. Okay. So we want to make this a function.

03:18:40
<transcript>: it's

03:18:41
<transcript>: It's gonna be.

03:18:44
<transcript>: Random item.

03:18:47
<transcript>: You pass it an array.

03:18:47
beardage: I wanna see a pure speed challenge between geohot and prime

03:18:52
<transcript>: Is an array and you get a random item. Then you make this item.

03:18:54
<transcript>: Generic.

03:18:55
0xvivek: shit

03:18:56
<transcript>: Where do you do that.

03:18:59
0xvivek: yeah want that too

03:19:03
<transcript>: Like that. I just have to do it. The other syntax. I can never remember how to do generics with arrow functions.

03:19:05
<transcript>: I just have to do this.

03:19:08
<transcript>: Function get random item.

03:19:11
<transcript>: Where's Matt when you need them Matt Pokemon.

03:19:11
<transcript>: here's the

03:19:19
<transcript>: Here's the mat signal. I need mat. How do I do it with arrow functions? I just. I like arrow functions. They're nice.

03:19:21
<transcript>: Array.

03:19:27
<transcript>: And then we want to return it.

03:19:27
<transcript>: let's see

03:19:28
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:19:31
<transcript>: Cops.

03:19:35
xxsallythegoosexx: george hotz is not that efficient in vim compared to prime. hotz just presses buttons very loudly and switches panes a lot.

03:19:36
<transcript>: Just return.

03:19:40
<transcript>: Array.

03:19:42
<transcript>: Oops.

03:19:46
<transcript>: Alright. Links. Okay.

03:19:51
<transcript>: Let's get random item. So here we're going to do it four times.

03:19:53
<transcript>: We're gonna say.

03:19:53
<transcript>: cons

03:19:55
<transcript>: Cons.

03:19:55
<transcript>: answer

03:19:58
<transcript>: Answer equals get random item.

03:20:03
<transcript>: From Resources, right.

03:20:05
<transcript>: And then.

03:20:07
<transcript>: Choices.

03:20:11
<transcript>: Equals answer and.

03:20:16
<transcript>: Let's do this.

03:20:19
<transcript>: Is there a better way to do this.

03:20:24
<transcript>: I know there is. But like.

03:20:24
<transcript>: is it worth

03:20:26
<transcript>: Is it worth doing.

03:20:26
<transcript>: there any better ways

03:20:28
<transcript>: There any better ways that's worth doing here.

03:20:35
<transcript>: This is how you all would do it probably not.

03:20:40
<transcript>: Do something more clever, right? That's not very clever. But does it work.

03:20:40
<transcript>: oh i need to

03:20:48
<transcript>: Oh, I need to put it in. I need to shuffle it. I need to put this in a random order. I can't put the answer in the first slot every time. That would be dumb.

03:20:58
beardage: I mean more like time-to-solution but they're both pretty quick in general

03:20:59
mhuggins7278: the generic thing

03:21:00
mhuggins7278: const returnInArray = <T>(value: T): T[] => {   return [value]; };  const strArray = returnInArray<string>('hello'); const numArray = returnInArray<number>(100);

03:21:02
<transcript>: You guys were talking about.

03:21:02
<transcript>: them

03:21:04
<transcript>: Them and people I don't know.

03:21:14
<transcript>: Planets go as popular after Co got sponsorship from them. I didn't know Theo was sponsored by Planet scale.

03:21:22
xxsallythegoosexx: that's not why it's popular lol

03:21:23
<transcript>: I just saw that Aaron Francis took a job.

03:21:23
<transcript>: at

03:21:25
<transcript>: At Planet scale.

03:21:25
<transcript>: i

03:21:27
<transcript>: I trivia.

03:21:27
<transcript>: thanks so much

03:21:30
<transcript>: Thanks so much for the follow. Or maybe it's L trivia. I can't tell.

03:21:38
<transcript>: How do I want to randomize the index here.

03:21:39
bearsample: resources has more than 4 choices ?

03:21:40
<transcript>: Yes.

03:21:44
<transcript>: Like a shuffle.

03:21:44
<transcript>: like a shuffle

03:21:45
<transcript>: Like a shuffle.

03:21:47
<transcript>: Javascript.

03:21:49
<transcript>: Shuffle around.

03:21:52
<transcript>: Let's do this.

03:21:54
<transcript>: Feels pretty good.

03:21:58
<transcript>: It doesn't look very good.

03:21:58
<transcript>: that looks

03:21:59
<transcript>: That looks like a lot.

03:22:03
<transcript>: Oh, we want.

03:22:06
<transcript>: I guess.

03:22:09
<transcript>: This is why people use like.

03:22:11
<transcript>: Low dash and stuff right.

03:22:14
<transcript>: Shuffle.

03:22:14
<transcript>: oh where am i

03:22:15
<transcript>: Oh, Where am I.

03:22:20
<transcript>: Shuffle.

03:22:32
<transcript>: Yank.

03:22:35
mhuggins7278: if you getting a random item do you need to shuffle after

03:22:42
<transcript>: Array is a.

03:22:42
<transcript>: p

03:22:43
<transcript>: P.

03:22:44
restarted: maybe get an array of four resources than randomly choice one as the answer

03:22:48
<transcript>: Oh, no, that's necessary. But.

03:22:48
<transcript>: okay

03:22:50
<transcript>: Okay.

03:22:50
<transcript>: array current

03:22:52
<transcript>: Array Current index. What is this.

03:22:54
<transcript>: Going on here.

03:22:58
<transcript>: Type T or undefined.

03:23:03
<transcript>: Sound type P.

03:23:05
<transcript>: How do you mean.

03:23:05
<transcript>: what

03:23:07
<transcript>: What could be undefined here.

03:23:09
<transcript>: Array.

03:23:11
<transcript>: Current index.

03:23:18
<transcript>: Wrong here.

03:23:18
<transcript>: hi

03:23:21
<transcript>: Hi T or undefined.

03:23:27
<transcript>: There's something unsafe about this code. Or can I just ignore it.

03:23:35
<transcript>: What's going on with this code? What is this.

03:23:38
<transcript>: Ray Current index.

03:23:42
<transcript>: I don't understand what's going on.

03:23:45
<transcript>: This syntax is throwing me off.

03:23:48
<transcript>: We're creating an array.

03:23:52
<transcript>: I don't know I don't love it.

03:23:54
<transcript>: Or something better.

03:24:01
<transcript>: Oh, here's some ECS Six version Shuffle array. Does that work.

03:24:01
restarted: const answer = getRandomItem(choices);

03:24:05
<transcript>: Oh, it's favors the lower end of the array.

03:24:11
<transcript>: Is cracking the change of suggestion actually introduces bias.

03:24:13
<transcript>: What.

03:24:15
<transcript>: What do we think? Is this one good.

03:24:21
<transcript>: Answer get random item choices.

03:24:29
<transcript>: Oh, hey, that's a good idea. Restarted. Then I don't need a swap. That's a way better idea. Are we not need a shuffle.

03:24:29
<transcript>: we don't need

03:24:31
<transcript>: We don't need this. Let's just.

03:24:35
<transcript>: Delete that Nope.

03:24:40
<transcript>: I delete this function. Dash. There we go.

03:24:40
<transcript>: of course

03:24:42
<transcript>: Of course.

03:24:42
<transcript>: as we get

03:24:44
<transcript>: As we get choices first.

03:24:44
<transcript>: we get

03:24:47
<transcript>: We get four random items. Right.

03:24:47
<transcript>: and then we just

03:24:51
<transcript>: And then we just say Answer is a random.

03:24:51
<transcript>: yeah from

03:24:54
<transcript>: Yeah. From choices, of course.

03:25:00
<transcript>: Of course. Comp answer thank you so much and welcome to Chat as well. Restarted.

03:25:03
<transcript>: Choices. So get random item.

03:25:03
<transcript>: choices

03:25:06
<transcript>: Choices that's better.

03:25:06
<transcript>: that's so much better

03:25:09
<transcript>: That's so much better. Okay, so round.

03:25:12
<transcript>: Answer here is going to be.

03:25:14
<transcript>: Now interesting.

03:25:18
<transcript>: Answers supposed to be a string.

03:25:18
<transcript>: but we have

03:25:23
<transcript>: But we have this like richer thing. I guess we'll just make the answer to the text.

03:25:26
<transcript>: Name.

03:25:31
<transcript>: Yeah. What's wrong with that.

03:25:34
<transcript>: Defined how so.

03:25:38
<transcript>: How is that in the fine choices.

03:25:42
<transcript>: How are these undefined get random item.

03:25:42
<transcript>: doesn't return

03:25:47
<transcript>: Doesn't return. Oh, it does potentially retire, then defined. Well, that's not true.

03:25:52
<transcript>: I know it's always gonna be I don't know how I know that? But I know that.

03:25:56
<transcript>: Okay, so answer name and then choices.

03:26:02
<transcript>: That's not the way to do it. Definitely not the way, but I did it. That's how I did it.

03:26:05
<transcript>: Snow turn choices as they are right.

03:26:05
<transcript>: except

03:26:09
<transcript>: Except. Yeah. Not that's right. No, wait.

03:26:12
<transcript>: Yes.

03:26:14
christoph0saurus: function shuffle(array) {   return array.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5); }

03:26:16
<transcript>: But we're gonna turn answer also.

03:26:16
<transcript>: in its full

03:26:19
<transcript>: In its full glory, like that. Okay.

03:26:23
<transcript>: So now our new game.

03:26:26
<transcript>: Let's see, let's go to index.

03:26:29
<transcript>: Here.

03:26:32
<transcript>: Print, round.

03:26:41
<transcript>: How do I get rid of that buffer.

03:26:44
<transcript>: How do I get rid of it.

03:26:46
<transcript>: Macro.

03:26:46
<transcript>: undue

03:26:48
<transcript>: Undue I.

03:26:48
<transcript>: know i have this

03:26:50
<transcript>: Know I have this buffer, and I don't want.

03:26:53
<transcript>: Quit it. There we go.

03:26:53
<transcript>: okay

03:26:55
<transcript>: Okay. Okay.

03:26:55
<transcript>: something

03:27:03
<transcript>: Something you'll learn about me on this stream is that I have to pee a lot. I just I drink a lot of stuff, and I just have to. I just have to. I'm dancing.

03:27:03
<transcript>: at that point

03:27:12
<transcript>: At that point it's time to take quick break. Thank you for the follow up Poeko and also Bear sample. Thank you for the following. I'll be right back.

03:30:21
<transcript>: Somebody gave me a way better shuffle function. That looks way better. Thank you so much, Kristoff. I don't think we need the shuffle anymore. But if I did, that looks way better.

03:30:26
<transcript>: At least way shorter into me shorter is better.

03:30:26
<transcript>: alright let's go

03:30:28
<transcript>: Alright. Let's go back.

03:30:39
<transcript>: What was I doing? So choices. Okay. So the type here. I really wish I could get the type from.

03:30:49
<transcript>: From here. Like this. Type. Answer, resource choices, resource array, ID. String game. Okay, I wish I could just have that.

03:30:54
<transcript>: What is that type.

03:30:58
<transcript>: This CRP give me access to that type.

03:31:02
<transcript>: Like.

03:31:04
<transcript>: The type of this thing.

03:31:15
<transcript>: Feels bad to be defining it down here, you know.

03:31:24
<transcript>: These are resources. I don't know if that's even a type I can import. Oh, yeah. Server router. Okay. Oh, yeah, yeah. Because I. Yeah.

03:31:24
<transcript>: okay

03:31:30
<transcript>: Okay. So those are resources. I guess this will work. It just still feels bad.

03:31:33
<transcript>: So then down here.

03:31:36
<transcript>: The key is choice.

03:31:36
<transcript>: at

03:31:37
<transcript>: At.

03:31:37
<transcript>: name

03:31:38
<transcript>: Name.

03:31:38
<transcript>: and this is

03:31:41
<transcript>: And this is choice name.

03:31:41
<transcript>: and then

03:31:44
<transcript>: And then the image.

03:31:46
<transcript>: Is round.

03:31:46
<transcript>: answer

03:31:48
dyalicode: !project

03:31:48
<transcript>: Answer.

03:31:48
<transcript>: image

03:31:49
<transcript>: Image.

03:31:49
<transcript>: all

03:31:52
<transcript>: All of this can go away.

03:31:57
<transcript>: All of this all of this all of this.

03:31:59
<transcript>: Like that.

03:31:59
<transcript>: resource

03:32:01
<transcript>: Resource Logo okay.

03:32:04
<transcript>: Yeah. That should work. Right.

03:32:10
<transcript>: Let's go over here.

03:32:13
<transcript>: Thank you for the following kaym's.

03:32:26
<transcript>: Project is AW. Guess none of my commands are working on right now. I took a break, I came back, I renamed my Twitch channel, and now my fossil body doesn't work, but I'm gonna figure it out.

03:32:29
<transcript>: Okay. So this almost works.

03:32:34
<transcript>: Almost.

03:32:40
<transcript>: So what didn't work here? Thanks for the follow pig. Ag.

03:32:40
<transcript>: so

03:32:43
<transcript>: So our logo's not Loading for one.

03:32:47
<transcript>: That's one problem we have.

03:32:47
<transcript>: image

03:32:53
<transcript>: Image source public hashed so the hash might be wrong. It's very possible.

03:32:53
<transcript>: public

03:32:57
<transcript>: Public? Oh, public shouldn't be included? Yeah, Yeah.

03:32:59
<transcript>: Public.

03:33:05
<transcript>: Should not be included? Whoa, Whoa? Why's this slow.

03:33:08
<transcript>: It got so slow on me.

03:33:10
<transcript>: Let's go.

03:33:10
<transcript>: in here

03:33:12
<transcript>: In here.

03:33:16
<transcript>: Resources.

03:33:18
<transcript>: Where is it.

03:33:21
<transcript>: I hashed somewhere? Did I hash it.

03:33:24
<transcript>: Choices.

03:33:29
<transcript>: Oh, no? I.

03:33:31
<transcript>: 'm in here.

03:33:36
<transcript>: Okay. Yeah. That's just need to do this. Let's see.

03:33:36
<transcript>: s

03:33:37
<transcript>: S.

03:33:37
<transcript>: percent s

03:33:38
<transcript>: Percent? S.

03:33:42
<transcript>: Let's do slash public.

03:33:45
<transcript>: Images.

03:33:45
<transcript>: needs to change

03:33:49
<transcript>: Needs to change to just images.

03:33:50
<transcript>: Right.

03:33:57
<transcript>: Okay.

03:34:00
<transcript>: Images hash that's good.

03:34:06
<transcript>: Let's I gotta have to restart the server I guess.

03:34:11
<transcript>: Maybe I didn't. I don't know. I don't know if I needed to restart.

03:34:15
<transcript>: These are the things that are really hard when you're learning a new stack. It's like.

03:34:15
<transcript>: when do you have

03:34:18
<transcript>: When do you have to restart stuff and.

03:34:18
<transcript>: that sort of thing

03:34:22
<transcript>: That sort of thing. Okay. New game. We click on the new game.

03:34:22
<transcript>: okay

03:34:26
<transcript>: Okay, we got an image. Loading. That's good news.

03:34:26
<transcript>: we've got

03:34:28
<transcript>: We've got some service names.

03:34:34
<transcript>: But we need to add a Tobs and Amazon to those they look weird without the prefix. Right.

03:34:47
<transcript>: So here we have the button. The button is now going to be.

03:34:47
<transcript>: choice name

03:34:48
<transcript>: Choice name.

03:34:48
<transcript>: also

03:34:49
<transcript>: Also.

03:34:52
<transcript>: Something else.

03:34:55
<transcript>: Also we want to do.

03:35:00
<transcript>: Choice.

03:35:01
<transcript>: Prefix.

03:35:07
<transcript>: But it's not ideal because the capitalization.

03:35:13
<transcript>: Prefix equals AWS.

03:35:13
<transcript>: then it's

03:35:33
<transcript>: Then it's AWS else Amazon. I don't want to do anything fancier than that. I think that's fine. Okay. Amazon e to do image Builder AWS, sync Box Crack Hota Amazon Work Docs SDK AWS, elemental live. Wow. Some of these are really hard and obscure. What do we think this one is? Ah, what is it? 10 seconds. Go.

03:35:39
<transcript>: That one. I don't know. We haven't done any of the actual work yet, so, like, wire up answers and all that.

03:35:46
<transcript>: Okay.

03:35:51
<transcript>: But we can now get a new round from the server. That's something.

03:35:54
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:35:54
<transcript>: let's pull

03:35:56
<transcript>: Let's pull this out into.

03:36:02
<transcript>: Let's have like a.

03:36:02
<transcript>: function

03:36:03
<transcript>: Function.

03:36:03
<transcript>: function

03:36:08
<transcript>: Function new round We'll pass a game ID.

03:36:11
<transcript>: And we'll get.

03:36:11
<transcript>: a new

03:36:15
<transcript>: A new round. So it's this code. Right here, right.

03:36:21
<transcript>: I guess. Well, I guess no, we don't want a new game. We just want.

03:36:31
<transcript>: This code.

03:36:31
<transcript>: right

03:36:32
<transcript>: Right here.

03:36:38
<transcript>: Oh, Jeez.

03:36:40
<transcript>: Up here. Right.

03:36:45
<transcript>: Answer. Random choices. Where was choices? Here.

03:36:49
<transcript>: Okay.

03:36:53
<transcript>: Voices.

03:37:00
<transcript>: Answer. We have a round. We create the round.

03:37:00
<transcript>: this is

03:37:02
<transcript>: This is an async function.

03:37:07
<transcript>: We need a context. Okay.

03:37:11
<transcript>: Context. I don't know what that type is.

03:37:17
<transcript>: Contact. What is this? Context.

03:37:20
<transcript>: What is it.

03:37:30
<transcript>: Key, context.

03:37:32
<transcript>: To pass it in.

03:37:32
<transcript>: thanks

03:37:34
<transcript>: Thanks for the follow test container.

03:37:35
trash_dev: It‚Äôs too early go to bes

03:37:37
<transcript>: Appreciate that.

03:37:37
trash_dev: Bed

03:37:39
<transcript>: Key, context.

03:37:44
0xvivek: what are you using for autocomplete ?

03:37:50
<transcript>: Create a new round from a game ID. Right.

03:37:55
<transcript>: This would be.

03:37:55
<transcript>: basically

03:37:59
hobowithahotbum: cursive programming font why

03:38:02
<transcript>: Basically the code we'd be creating or running, but I don't know what context type should be.

03:38:08
<transcript>: It's not clear to me by looking at this.

03:38:08
<transcript>: i

03:38:10
<transcript>: I guess. Is that it.

03:38:10
<transcript>: prismacola

03:38:13
<transcript>: Prismacola Client. All that stuff.

03:38:22
thechosenone1080: @hobowithahotbum pls dont judge other peoples font

03:38:24
<transcript>: Anyone know.

03:38:33
hobowithahotbum: but i want to

03:38:33
0xvivek: lol

03:38:34
thechosenone1080: font is up to everyone's own preference

03:38:35
<transcript>: Great round.

03:38:35
<transcript>: call

03:38:38
<transcript>: Call it New round.

03:38:38
<transcript>: like create

03:38:39
<transcript>: Like create round better.

03:38:42
thechosenone1080: for example i like comic sans

03:38:45
0xvivek: I like Iosevka

03:38:48
<transcript>: So I'm just going to pass it context and see if that helps me.

03:38:51
<transcript>: Game ID.

03:38:54
thechosenone1080: thats what i use to code

03:38:56
hobowithahotbum: ok i start using wingdins

03:38:58
<transcript>: All this stuff needs go away.

03:39:09
<transcript>: I deleted something I shouldn't have.

03:39:16
<transcript>: Where is that.

03:39:20
thechosenone1080: good

03:39:20
<transcript>: Where's the comic expected. What do they mean.

03:39:22
glycincheck: ,

03:39:26
<transcript>: Seven day.

03:39:35
<transcript>: No, still mess it up.

03:39:38
glycincheck: just a comma before the next .mutation

03:39:38
<transcript>: Still somehow messed up.

03:39:40
<transcript>: What's problem here.

03:39:44
<transcript>: Just have one extra. Yeah. Okay.

03:39:47
<transcript>: So then what is the type of this context.

03:39:50
<transcript>: Implicitly has any.

03:40:01
<transcript>: I guess it just has this Prisma. That's what I the only thing I'm using.

03:40:04
<transcript>: Is a Prisma client.

03:40:04
<transcript>: i could

03:40:06
<transcript>: I could just say maybe.

03:40:12
<transcript>: Gizma is a Prisma client. I don't know. Can I just do that.

03:40:18
<transcript>: But it's got to know the types, right? No. Is that good.

03:40:20
<transcript>: Is that good.

03:40:23
<transcript>: Maybe.

03:40:32
<transcript>: It looks like it's happy. I don't know. I expected the prisoner thing to need to have a generic type or something.

03:40:35
<transcript>: But I guess it knows what around us.

03:40:39
<transcript>: Okay.

03:40:39
<transcript>: cool

03:40:49
<transcript>: Cool. Await. Prisoner round crit. Okay, so this is how we can create a new round. This way. Here. Whenever you answer if you get it right we created a round if you get it wrong.

03:40:53
<transcript>: We might subtract points. We're not sure.

03:41:05
<transcript>: Welcome to chat.

03:41:05
<transcript>: hobo

03:41:07
<transcript>: Hobo with a Hot bum.

03:41:07
<transcript>: that's quite a name

03:41:18
<transcript>: That's quite a name. Should have just stuck with Hope. Oh, just stop there. Probably when I was reading your name. Cursive programming font. Why? I just like it. I've used Operator Mono for a long time now.

03:41:18
<transcript>: probably like five years

03:41:34
<transcript>: Probably like five years, and I just really like it. In fact, I try to actively find different types of code that I want to make cursive so you can see, like keywords or cursive and comments or cursive. And sometimes I'm like, maybe I need to add more stuff because I don't write many comments if I'm being honest.

03:41:37
<transcript>: What am I using for.

03:41:37
<transcript>: a

03:41:41
<transcript>: A stressive trusted here. I didn't see it. Sorry, trash.

03:41:44
<transcript>: It's too early to go to bed.

03:41:52
<transcript>: Oh, it's too early. Go to bed trash. I've been streaming for like 4 hours. Okay, 3 hours and 40 minutes.

03:41:55
<transcript>: You're on the West Coast. Trash. Trash. I think.

03:41:55
<transcript>: so yeah

03:41:57
<transcript>: So yeah, it is early for you.

03:42:00
<transcript>: What am I using for autocomplete? I'm using.

03:42:07
<transcript>: Well, this is Neil Vim, and I'm using an LSP. The TypeScript LSP would probably be a lot of the autocomplete, I guess.

03:42:13
<transcript>: Yeah. I guess that'd be it just the language server for TypeScript.

03:42:22
<transcript>: Okay. I'm caught up.

03:42:26
<transcript>: I'm caught up so we've got create round.

03:42:34
<transcript>: Mutation new. The next mutation of one is answer. So this is when somebody tries to answer, they.

03:42:38
<transcript>: They provide a choice and a game ID.

03:42:45
<transcript>: Guess we're just checking based on the name of the service.

03:42:45
<transcript>: like whether

03:42:48
<transcript>: Like whether they were right or not, feels kind of weird, but.

03:42:55
<transcript>: It feels like should be an ID or something.

03:42:57
<transcript>: But.

03:43:00
<transcript>: I don't know. I think it works.

03:43:00
<transcript>: so if

03:43:02
<transcript>: So if you answer.

03:43:02
<transcript>: game id

03:43:07
<transcript>: Game ID and choice. We check to see, so we need to first fetch.

03:43:07
<transcript>: so

03:43:12
<transcript>: So round. We need to get the round right away. Context. That Prisma.

03:43:18
<transcript>: Round what do I do? How do I find? Find mini, find first.

03:43:20
<transcript>: Find first.

03:43:28
<transcript>: Throw find first. What am I looking for? I'm looking for.

03:43:34
<transcript>: Args. Let's see. Select where.

03:43:34
<transcript>: this is where i'm

03:43:36
<transcript>: This is where I'm gonna do something like this.

03:43:36
<transcript>: where

03:43:37
<transcript>: Where.

03:43:37
<transcript>: i don't know how to do

03:43:40
<transcript>: I don't know how to do Prisma. I know nothing about print.

03:43:46
<transcript>: Where.

03:43:46
<transcript>: i just

03:43:49
<transcript>: I just need some basic syntax.

03:43:52
<transcript>: Code reference that looks pretty good.

03:43:56
<transcript>: Let's do read.

03:44:01
<transcript>: Except all cookies.

03:44:08
<transcript>: Create. I said I want to do read. Here we go find unique where email is that.

03:44:13
<transcript>: Something I can do find unique I think find unique.

03:44:16
<transcript>: And it's where.

03:44:21
<transcript>: And then I do a bracket like this. And I say.

03:44:23
<transcript>: Where.

03:44:25
<transcript>: Name.

03:44:29
<transcript>: Is equal to choice.

03:44:29
<transcript>: now

03:44:34
<transcript>: Now what about what am I doing? No. The round. I need the current round.

03:44:38
<transcript>: I'm trying to find the current round.

03:44:40
cristhianjhlcom: !git

03:44:43
<transcript>: And it's gonna have an answer, feel, field.

03:44:50
<transcript>: So should we have it passed the round? Id instead of yeah, maybe instead of the game ID. Do I need the game ID.

03:44:54
<transcript>: I don't think I do. I think this just needs to be.

03:44:56
<transcript>: Round ID.

03:44:56
<transcript>: right

03:44:57
<transcript>: Right.

03:45:02
<transcript>: Do you answer you say here's the round and here's the choice.

03:45:05
<transcript>: Right.

03:45:05
<transcript>: and then

03:45:09
<transcript>: And then this would be where ID.

03:45:09
<transcript>: is equal

03:45:13
<transcript>: Is equal to round ID. Okay.

03:45:15
cristhianjhlcom: hello can someone share me the dotfile link pls LUL

03:45:17
<transcript>: So we're gonna ignore expiration for a SEC.

03:45:20
<transcript>: secure the dot

03:45:20
<transcript>: secure the dot mouse link

03:45:24
<transcript>: Secure the Dot mouse link. Yeah, it's GitHub.com.

03:45:24
<transcript>: adam omore

03:45:25
<transcript>: Adam? Omore.

03:45:29
<transcript>: Adam Elmore.

03:45:31
adamdotdev: github.com/adamelmore/dotfiles

03:45:32
<transcript>: Files.

03:45:32
<transcript>: my

03:45:34
<transcript>: My fossil Bout's broken I apologize.

03:45:34
<transcript>: also

03:45:37
cristhianjhlcom: thanks

03:45:39
<transcript>: Also apologize. You have to watch this in ten AP. And I know some people can't watch it. And I'm sorry.

03:45:51
<transcript>: Find unique round. Okay, so here's our round. Right.

03:45:54
<transcript>: Okay.

03:45:54
<transcript>: that's a little bit of a

03:45:57
<transcript>: That's a little bit of a Downer for me, that's all.

03:45:57
<transcript>: so

03:46:00
<transcript>: So if there's not a round.

03:46:03
<transcript>: This is a problem, right.

03:46:05
<transcript>: There's not around.

03:46:22
<transcript>: I don't know what happened in TrpC. If I just throw an error, can I just throw an arrow like that.

03:46:27
<transcript>: We're gonna see.

03:46:27
<transcript>: so

03:46:33
<transcript>: So now we can know that there is a round. And we can say if.

03:46:38
<transcript>: Round.

03:46:38
<transcript>: answer

03:46:39
<transcript>: Answer.

03:46:42
<transcript>: Equals choice.

03:46:42
<transcript>: since

03:46:43
<transcript>: Since I got it right.

03:46:53
<transcript>: Got it wrong.

03:47:00
<transcript>: If I got it wrong we're going to return.

03:47:07
<transcript>: Correct. False. I don't know what I want to do here.

03:47:12
<transcript>: I got it right.

03:47:17
<transcript>: We want to get a new round. New round equals the weight.

03:47:23
<transcript>: Create round.

03:47:25
<transcript>: Aim ID.

03:47:27
<transcript>: Round.

03:47:27
<transcript>: game id

03:47:28
<transcript>: Game ID.

03:47:31
<transcript>: What else? I have to pass the Create round.

03:47:39
<transcript>: Of the game. Id. Wait, I already did that. Let's pass the Prisma.

03:47:44
<transcript>: Okay, we have a new round. We're going to return.

03:47:50
<transcript>: We're gonna say.

03:47:50
<transcript>: return

03:47:51
<transcript>: Return.

03:47:53
<transcript>: Correct.

03:47:53
<transcript>: true

03:47:55
<transcript>: True. And then.

03:47:55
<transcript>: new

03:47:57
<transcript>: New round.

03:48:05
<transcript>: Thank you so much for the subscription Zappie. I appreciate your tier OneSub. Appreciate that a lot. Thank you so much.

03:48:09
<transcript>: Correct.

03:48:09
<transcript>: true new

03:48:11
<transcript>: True new round okay.

03:48:11
<transcript>: that reminds

03:48:20
<transcript>: That reminds me I think I saw I think I saw I got a payout my first payout on Twitch. I believe let me see if that's true.

03:48:24
<transcript>: I saw an email. I didn't look at it yet, but I think.

03:48:27
<transcript>: Think we got to pay out.

03:48:29
<transcript>: View my payouts.

03:48:38
<transcript>: And we are going to be donating that payout.

03:48:38
<transcript>: to somewhere

03:48:39
<transcript>: To somewhere.

03:48:39
<transcript>: to

03:48:42
<transcript>: To a charity.

03:48:48
<transcript>: We're gonna choose a terrible organization that does work in diversity in tech.

03:48:50
<transcript>: Something I'm pretty passionate about.

03:48:50
<transcript>: i know

03:48:56
<transcript>: I know that I had it pretty easy getting to this stage in life because of my demographic.

03:48:56
<transcript>: and i

03:49:07
<transcript>: And I know this is like this is a hot topic. I don't want to, like, stir up. I'm not looking to debate you on my Twitch chat here, but I know if there's anything I can do.

03:49:27
<transcript>: To reflect any of the tension I've gotten on the Internet towards those who've maybe had a tougher time than I had getting to this point in life. I want to do that. So I'm here on Twitter to have fun and enjoy company while I work. And it's been amazing for that. I love interacting with you all on Twitch chat, but it's not a job. This is not a thing I want to do.

03:49:27
<transcript>: to try

03:49:32
<transcript>: To try and earn income. I know that there are financial incentives.

03:49:32
<transcript>: and to that end

03:49:38
<transcript>: And to that end, we're gonna donate any of my Twitch proceeds. Anything I get paid out by Twitch.

03:49:38
<transcript>: is gonna be don

03:49:44
<transcript>: Is gonna be donated to charter organizations. We're probably gonna just like Vote. I'll do a poll. I'll offer you some options.

03:49:48
<transcript>: I'm aware of a few of them that my friends are involved with.

03:49:48
<transcript>: but

03:49:48
cristhianjhlcom: Clap

03:49:55
<transcript>: But there might be people in Twitch chat that have organizations are really passionate about supporting. We'll do that.

03:49:55
<transcript>: so

03:50:01
<transcript>: So I do need to make sure I actually got a payout. I think I gotta pay out. I still just don't know how to read this.

03:50:12
<transcript>: Next payout. September 15. That's tomorrow. Okay, so tomorrow on Stream. We will pick an organization, and we will donate. It's not gonna be a lot of money. It's not gonna be a lot.

03:50:14
<transcript>: I don't know how much money.

03:50:14
<transcript>: but

03:50:16
<transcript>: But it's not gonna be much.

03:50:16
<transcript>: but we're gonna

03:50:18
<transcript>: But we're gonna donate it.

03:50:18
<transcript>: okay

03:50:20
<transcript>: Okay, back to.

03:50:20
<transcript>: back

03:50:25
bearsample: chapeau

03:50:30
<transcript>: Back to this. So we got new round crate, round Krisma game ID. And then we're gonna return the round. So I think this is good enough.

03:50:38
<transcript>: As long as we return, correct or not, we're gonna worry about the expiration thing here in a second. So we're gonna make sure rounds have to be answered within a certain time frame.

03:50:43
<transcript>: But we're gonna mutation answer round idea in choice just like that.

03:50:46
<transcript>: And then do I need this one at all.

03:50:50
<transcript>: We're gonna delete it for now.

03:50:59
<transcript>: We've got a new game and answer, those are our two.

03:51:03
<transcript>: Mutations. Let's go back to index.

03:51:03
<transcript>: do i

03:51:05
<transcript>: Do I need to.

03:51:11
<transcript>: Do I need to restart the server? I just never know.

03:51:11
<transcript>: anymore

03:51:12
<transcript>: Anymore.

03:51:12
<transcript>: okay

03:51:14
<transcript>: Okay.

03:51:14
<transcript>: round

03:51:14
cristhianjhlcom: Any idea to how use (auto import/go to definition/etc) on js without lsp, coc, im working in a large project but they use node version 10 LUL

03:51:17
<transcript>: Round so up here we create a new game.

03:51:22
<transcript>: We have a current round we need to have in Ram.

03:51:26
<transcript>: This button press does something right.

03:51:26
<transcript>: thank you for the

03:51:28
<transcript>: Thank you for the follow.

03:51:33
<transcript>: Dug in it. Dug in it. Any idea how to use.

03:51:33
<transcript>: autoim

03:51:35
<transcript>: Autoimport go to definition.

03:51:35
<transcript>: on js

03:51:40
<transcript>: On JS without LSP I'm working on a large project with these node version ten.

03:51:43
<transcript>: I do not know.

03:51:43
<transcript>: how

03:51:46
<transcript>: How to do go to definition without an LSP.

03:51:54
<transcript>: Unless I'm already doing that, and I didn't know it. I think I'm using the LSP for go to Definition. Yeah, I am. I'm definitely using LSD.

03:51:54
<transcript>: you can

03:51:56
<transcript>: You can't use an LSP.

03:52:00
<transcript>: Could you explain why that's not an option.

03:52:02
<transcript>: Perhaps.

03:52:04
<transcript>: Crispian.

03:52:07
<transcript>: Okay.

03:52:10
<transcript>: What was it in here.

03:52:10
<transcript>: oh yeah

03:52:13
<transcript>: Oh yeah? So key on click.

03:52:16
<transcript>: Handle.

03:52:16
<transcript>: let's see

03:52:18
<transcript>: Let's see.

03:52:20
<transcript>: Handle.

03:52:21
cristhianjhlcom: no, lsp/coc need version 14 or more

03:52:25
<transcript>: Answer click and we're gonna pass the.

03:52:25
<transcript>: choice

03:52:27
<transcript>: Choice.

03:52:31
<transcript>: Name.

03:52:37
<transcript>: I think I'm just gonna have this passed in so that this thing is just doing nothing still.

03:52:40
<transcript>: On.

03:52:44
<transcript>: Answer.

03:52:44
<transcript>: unanswer

03:52:50
<transcript>: Unanswer. That's good. That's gonna have a choice. Shipping.

03:52:58
<transcript>: Yeah, Yeah.

03:53:01
<transcript>: On answer.

03:53:08
<transcript>: We need to specify.

03:53:08
<transcript>: this

03:53:10
<transcript>: This.

03:53:10
<transcript>: on

03:53:13
<transcript>: On Answer, candle, answer.

03:53:17
<transcript>: Right here.

03:53:19
<transcript>: Async function.

03:53:21
<transcript>: Handle.

03:53:21
<transcript>: answer

03:53:22
<transcript>: Answer.

03:53:26
<transcript>: I'm gonna call the stream here pretty soon. This is a heads up.

03:53:31
<transcript>: It was good to get back into it, but.

03:53:31
<transcript>: it's my first

03:53:33
<transcript>: It's my first day back after vacation.

03:53:36
<transcript>: I got a few things I need to take care of. Probably.

03:53:36
<transcript>: some housekeeping

03:53:37
<transcript>: Some housekeeping.

03:53:43
<transcript>: But let's try and get answers working here. At least handle answer.

03:53:43
<transcript>: this is going

03:53:45
<transcript>: This is going to be we need a new mutation.

03:53:45
<transcript>: so this is gonna be

03:53:48
<transcript>: So this is gonna be the answer. Mutation.

03:53:48
<transcript>: my computer

03:53:51
<transcript>: My computer. Pc. I think I like it.

03:53:55
<transcript>: I think that's the verdict so far.

03:53:58
<transcript>: I'm still curious about a lot of things.

03:53:58
<transcript>: but i

03:54:00
<transcript>: But I like it so far.

03:54:03
<transcript>: Wait answer mutation.

03:54:03
<transcript>: dot

03:54:06
<transcript>: Dot. We take a sink.

03:54:06
<transcript>: and we have

03:54:10
<transcript>: And we have to pass a name ID. I believe.

03:54:12
<transcript>: Which is the.

03:54:19
<transcript>: Oh, no, we have to pass the round ID. There we go. I know it should be TypeScript.

03:54:19
<transcript>: round

03:54:22
<transcript>: Round ID is going to be current round.

03:54:25
<transcript>: Id.

03:54:25
<transcript>: and

03:54:27
<transcript>: And choice.

03:54:36
<transcript>: Why is that not there we go. Choice is.

03:54:36
<transcript>: what

03:54:37
<transcript>: What.

03:54:37
<transcript>: handle

03:54:41
<transcript>: Handle answer takes in a choice which is string.

03:54:41
<transcript>: okay

03:54:42
<transcript>: Okay.

03:54:47
<transcript>: So choice like that.

03:54:47
<transcript>: what's

03:54:53
<transcript>: What's wrong with this type? String. Undefined. Okay. So that could be undefined. So we need to say.

03:54:57
<transcript>: If not.

03:54:57
<transcript>: current

03:55:02
<transcript>: Current round return I don't know that's bad.

03:55:02
<transcript>: that's

03:55:04
<transcript>: That's bad.

03:55:04
<transcript>: but it does

03:55:06
<transcript>: But it does fix this problem.

03:55:08
<transcript>: Right.

03:55:17
<transcript>: There's not a current round and you answer. How would you answer if there's no current round? Let me tell me that. Thank you so much with follows. Vicher.

03:55:17
<transcript>: and lucid

03:55:22
<transcript>: And Lucid Frost. I appreciate your follows whole lot.

03:55:27
<transcript>: No LSP Csc'd need version 14 or more.

03:55:27
andreull: if it works, don't fix it  hahaha

03:55:44
<transcript>: So you need node version 14 to run the TypeScript LSPs that we're saying we're don't fix it. That's right. On J. That's right. It works. We think so. We're not gonna fix it. So there's our response. Now we need to set current round. Well, first, we need to say if.

03:55:46
<transcript>: That's not correct.

03:55:51
<transcript>: Okay. If it's correct.

03:55:56
<transcript>: Let's just log correct.

03:56:07
<transcript>: Console, log.

03:56:10
<transcript>: Incorrect.

03:56:13
<transcript>: And then appear we're gonna set current range, round.

03:56:16
<transcript>: To response.

03:56:16
<transcript>: id

03:56:17
<transcript>: Id.

03:56:17
<transcript>: so

03:56:18
<transcript>: So.

03:56:25
<transcript>: This could be that the shape is different depending on yeah, yeah. See it's either. Got all that stuff where it doesn't.

03:56:35
<transcript>: Say we know it's.

03:56:40
<transcript>: You know it's got that thing. How do I say that.

03:56:44
<transcript>: How do we narrow the type of this thing.

03:56:49
<transcript>: Maybe I should shape it. This back end. Let's actually do that. Let's let's say.

03:56:53
<transcript>: It's got a.

03:56:53
<transcript>: around

03:56:54
<transcript>: Around.

03:56:54
<transcript>: or we call it

03:56:56
<transcript>: Or we call it next.

03:57:01
<transcript>: Is new round.

03:57:03
<transcript>: I actually just rename that next.

03:57:06
<transcript>: Okay.

03:57:06
<transcript>: so

03:57:10
<transcript>: So next and then this one is gonna have.

03:57:10
<transcript>: next

03:57:11
<transcript>: Next.

03:57:11
<transcript>: undefined

03:57:13
<transcript>: Undefined, I guess.

03:57:17
<transcript>: Is null.

03:57:20
<transcript>: Maybe that.

03:57:22
<transcript>: What do you think about that.

03:57:26
<transcript>: Now, response.

03:57:34
<transcript>: Next. So they always have that shade.

03:57:34
<transcript>: it just could be

03:57:38
<transcript>: It just could be null. Is what it's complaining about. Now.

03:57:42
<transcript>: I'm gonna say I know it's not normal? Forbidden.

03:57:42
<transcript>: it's a

03:57:46
<transcript>: It's a forbidden on no assertion. Well, who's forbidding me.

03:57:48
<transcript>: Who forbade me.

03:57:52
<transcript>: Just lint. You know what I think about that. Yes.

03:57:59
<transcript>: Don't care. That's what I think about that. I just don't care if you don't want me to do that. Okay? Save it.

03:58:04
<transcript>: What's going on here.

03:58:10
<transcript>: You can never use my navigation over here. Okay.

03:58:13
<transcript>: Here we go. Let's see if it works.

03:58:17
<transcript>: So that's super slow.

03:58:17
<transcript>: that

03:58:33
<transcript>: That whole generating the game thing. We gotta figure out why that's so slow. We got Amazon DevOps Guru AWS code deploy a DBS cloud trail, and then that's ugly Amazon Sage Maker Studio lab. What do we think this is? I think it's I should know. This code deploy.

03:58:41
<transcript>: Yeah. So I'm gonna click on answer. We're gonna watch the network tab here. What should happen. It should change the round if I get it correct.

03:58:43
<transcript>: And it did.

03:58:43
<transcript>: it did

03:58:47
<transcript>: It did. It was correct. And it did, it worked, it worked.

03:58:49
<transcript>: So what do I think this one is.

03:58:58
<transcript>: Easy to auto scaling. It worked. Look at this. I'm so good at this. This is Personal Health bash. Yeah. Hi. Actually knew that one.

03:58:58
<transcript>: such a nerd

03:58:59
<transcript>: Such a nerd.

03:58:59
<transcript>: fs

03:59:02
<transcript>: Fsx ECS anywhere.

03:59:02
<transcript>: fsc or over

03:59:09
<transcript>: Fsc or over there. Time stream, ECS anywhere. Got it. Nailed it. We already did this one. Look at this. I've got like six in a row.

03:59:09
<transcript>: that's

03:59:13
<transcript>: That's Athena, isn't it? No. Macy.

03:59:14
<transcript>: Recognition.

03:59:14
<transcript>: recognition

03:59:21
<transcript>: Recognition. Got it. This is so funny. Okay. This game's awesome. We made an awesome game. That security hub.

03:59:21
<transcript>: i know

03:59:25
<transcript>: I know a lot of AWS Services people. I know a lot of them, apparently.

03:59:29
<transcript>: Oh, what's this one though? Express workflows.

03:59:41
<transcript>: Wrong. I know, because it didn't give me a new one. Elastic Box store. Oh, wow. I'm so bad. Bracket. There's bracket. Okay.

03:59:44
<transcript>: We did it.

03:59:44
<transcript>: that was kind

03:59:46
<transcript>: That was kind of fun.

03:59:46
<transcript>: so

03:59:52
<transcript>: So there's obviously a ton of work to do to make this an actual game, like.

04:00:06
<transcript>: Just. I mean, I don't know where to start, but we're not gonna do it all today. We are just getting ready to hit the 4 hours Mark and need to cut it a little short today. Tomorrow and Friday will be longer streams. I'll stream all day tomorrow and Friday.

04:00:11
<transcript>: And we'll hopefully wrap this thing up. I think we can wrap this game up this week. I think.

04:00:20
<transcript>: The goal is to get it to a place where it's multiplayer, where anybody can challenge somebody else and you're like speed working through the game.

04:00:20
<transcript>: we'll work

04:00:31
<transcript>: We'll work on some just make it better, right? But I think there's some promise here, at least as an AWS nerd. Like myself, I enjoyed it. That was fun. Clicking around, trying to guess what the service was.

04:00:31
<transcript>: be

04:00:33
<transcript>: Beige. Thank you so much.

04:00:33
<transcript>: yeah beig

04:00:37
<transcript>: Yeah. Beige Bayesian F. Thank you for the follow. I appreciate that.

04:00:37
<transcript>: yeah

04:00:43
<transcript>: Yeah. Hopefully tomorrow when I stream. Hopefully we'll get the transcoding options.

04:00:50
<transcript>: Where you don't stuck watching my 1080p streets. I feel bad for anybody that couldn't watch today or it was laggy.

04:00:50
<transcript>: because

04:00:56
<transcript>: Because I'm just pumping too much bandwidth at you. I apologize. I think this is the first time.

04:00:56
<transcript>: that i'm aware of

04:01:00
<transcript>: That I'm aware of people haven't been able to watch in 720p or whatever.

04:01:00
<transcript>: so i'm sorry about that

04:01:01
<transcript>: So I'm sorry about that.

04:01:01
<transcript>: also just as a

04:01:20
<transcript>: Also, just as a note, I know there's probably a lot of new people in the stream. I raid someone randomly, someone that I follow every time I in the stream so it could be any one of a few people at the end of the stream. Here, you'll see me raid. But I just wanted to know it's random. I'm not like choosing the same people every time. Sometimes it just uses the same person every time. You know what I mean.

04:01:20
<transcript>: but

04:01:28
<transcript>: But yeah, it's been really fun. I'm back at it feels good to be back from vacation. I'm feeling mostly woken up at this point.

04:01:28
<transcript>: getting my

04:01:33
<transcript>: Getting my bearings? Yeah. Been great. Maybe we could do again some time.
